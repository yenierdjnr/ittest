  "description": "EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification covers concepts and tools related to exploiting systems, networks, devices and operating platforms. It is designed to get an individual into the world of pen testing to learn techniques of how to test a network or infrastructure. This includes hacking concepts such as vulnerability assessment, network intrusion, reverse engineering, defacing websites, damaging network appliances, launching distributed denial-of-service attacks, massive worm propagation, breaking passwords, brute-forcing authentication systems, cracking encryption, exploiting systems, advance viruses, Trojans, and other malware. This certificate is targeted at site administrators, security professionals, auditors and anyone who is concerned about the integrity of the network infrastructure that has practical real world experience to support this type of equipment.",

          "description": "Properly securing servers and networks is a significant challenge due to the ever changing attack methods used by hackers. The most successful security technicians have a thorough understanding of the tools and techniques used by the hackers themselves. This practical knowledge of attack methods allows a defender to assemble more flexible protections for their systems. The Certified Ethical Hacker certification is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge. This is the first step to becoming a Penetration Tester and increasing your ability to secure a network.",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,583\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:11,510\nIn this segment we're gonna take a look at\nthe Certified Ethical Hacker certification\n\n3\n00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,130\nand the exam content that\nwe're preparing for ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,460\nA lot of you are out there\nwondering the same question.\n\n5\n00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,020\nWhat is CEH and\nis it the right certification for me?\n\n6\n00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,340\nSo we just wanted to take a moment to\ndescribe the cert, describe the training\n\n7\n00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,550\nthat we offer and kind of show you\nwhat all is involved in this process.\n\n8\n00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,720\nNow I've got with me Sean and\nSean can you give just kind of a,\n\n9\n00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,270\na real quick just summary of\nwhat is the CEH certification?\n\n10\n00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,050\n>> That's a good question.\n\n11\n00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,140\nThe CEH is,\nis a certification that's designed to\n\n12\n00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,140\nget an individual into\nthe world of pen testing.\n\n13\n00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,310\nAnd learning how to use the various\ntools and techniques to audit or\n\n14\n00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,860\ntest their networks and their\ninfrastructure as well as their people and\n\n15\n00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,130\ntheir policies to see if if there's\nany weakness or any problems that\n\n16\n00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,245\nthey can address before, you know, not to\nbe overly dramatic, the bad guys find it.\n\n17\n00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:02,100\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it, always better that\nwe find this stuff first before they do,\n\n18\n00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,170\nbecause otherwise,\nthat's when we get in trouble, right?\n\n19\n00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,220\n>> Exactly.\n\n20\n00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,840\n>> And now that, the CEH certification is,\nit's developed and, and\n\n21\n00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,730\nadministered by an organization\ncalled the EC Council, and\n\n22\n00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,065\nthey've taken a lot of time to make sure\nthat it covers the topics that are really\n\n23\n00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:18,320\nrequired knowledge for\nanybody working in this field.\n\n24\n00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,110\nIf you're not familiar with\nthe certification in detail,\n\n25\n00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,030\nyou can always jump over to their website.\n\n26\n00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,110\nIt's eccouncil.org.\n\n27\n00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,760\nAnd they've got all the information\navailable on their site.\n\n28\n00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,990\nIf you jump to their site you'll see\na nice big button right here for\n\n29\n00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,220\nCertifications and it will take you to\nthe various certifications they've got.\n\n30\n00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,460\nAnd the one we're talking\nabout right here is CEH.\n\n31\n00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,280\nRight there on the website they\nlay out all the different ob,\n\n32\n00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,450\nobjectives that are covered and\nthere's quite a bit of stuff in there.\n\n33\n00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,150\nFrom things like background, analysis and\nassessment, security we've got tools,\n\n34\n00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,190\nsystems, and programs.\n\n35\n00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,260\nThat's what a lot of people that want to\nwatch CEH are really excited about that.\n\n36\n00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,940\nLike, I want to learn how to,\nhow to hack something.\n\n37\n00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,500\nBut it's not really just about that.\n\n38\n00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,580\nIt's about if you're going to protect\nyourself from an attack, you've\n\n39\n00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,420\ngotta understand the weapons that the,\nwell, being overly dramatic again, right?\n\n40\n00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,130\nThe, the weapons that the enemy has.\n\n41\n00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,590\nYou've gotta know how to defend yourself\nagainst the attacks that are out there.\n\n42\n00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,850\nAnd the best way to do that is\nto understand how those work.\n\n43\n00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,580\nSo sure,\na portion of the exam is based on that.\n\n44\n00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,060\nBut the majority of it is based on how you\nare going to be protecting yourself and\n\n45\n00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,380\nusing that knowledge for\nthe forces of good.\n\n46\n00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,958\nRight?\n\n47\n00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,477\nWith great power comes\ngreat responsibility and\n\n48\n00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:22,860\nwe could probably rip off 100 movie\nquotes right here, couldn't we?\n\n49\n00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,385\n>> Exactly.\n\n50\n00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,895\n>> So\nall of that is a part of the CEH exam.\n\n51\n00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,705\nNow, if you're getting prepared for\nthis exam,\n\n52\n00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:31,495\nthere is a little bit you need\nto know about the exam itself.\n\n53\n00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:34,305\nSo so let's start with the,\nthe details, right?\n\n54\n00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,825\nThe exam itself is 125 questions long.\n\n55\n00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,420\nAnd you get four hours to take it.\n\n56\n00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,990\nNow that might sound like a lot of time.\n\n57\n00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,190\nFour hours for 125 questions.\n\n58\n00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,170\nBut the questions are made up of\na lot of different types, right Sean?\n\n59\n00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,514\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n60\n00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:53,607\nThe questions on this exam are a mixture\nof multiple choice as well as\n\n61\n00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,150\nI like to say, labs.\n\n62\n00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,480\nBut there's a picture and\nit'll ask you to evaluate the picture and\n\n63\n00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,000\nanswer some questions on it to see\nyou know what is actually happening.\n\n64\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,500\nYou know so you'll see those two types,\nyou know, it's more.\n\n65\n00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,389\nAnd, and I should I add you know\nonto what Don was saying that it's\n\n66\n00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:15,199\n125 questions you have four hours but\nyou, it's actually plenty of time, so\n\n67\n00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,600\ndon't be too worried,\nyou know, about that.\n\n68\n00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,930\nYou know, manage your time wisely and\nyou'll be fine.\n\n69\n00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,840\n>> Now, now when you're ready\nto take the exam, well,\n\n70\n00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,690\nhow do you know you're ready, right?\n\n71\n00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,410\nYou've got to study.\n\n72\n00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,500\nYou've got to hit all the material.\n\n73\n00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,600\nIt's a lot of information and it's not\ndesigned for somebody just getting started\n\n74\n00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,180\nin IT or just getting started\nin security for that matter.\n\n75\n00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,250\nYou're expected to have practical\nreal world experience supporting\n\n76\n00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,230\nthis equipment.\n\n77\n00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,490\nThe only way to learn is in\nthe field because the technology is\n\n78\n00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,940\nconstantly changing.\n\n79\n00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,730\nAn attack that is valid\ntoday is dead tomorrow and\n\n80\n00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,500\nthere's all new attacks that are out.\n\n81\n00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500\nSo you've really got to have relevant\nknowledge far outside the field.\n\n82\n00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,980\nNow, don't let it deter you from the show\nif you're just wanting to learn more.\n\n83\n00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,610\nThis is a great resource for you.\n\n84\n00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,755\nBut if you're looking to get certified,\nthere is no substitute for\n\n85\n00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:01,610\nhandson experience with this technology.\n\n86\n00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,570\nYou've really got to practice and\nwork with it and stay up to date,\n\n87\n00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,290\nit's really important.\n\n88\n00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,640\nNot with the CEH exam there has been\na number of versions of it over the years\n\n89\n00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,650\nwe're currently on version 8 and\nthat's a part of staying relevant right?\n\n90\n00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,100\nAny security certification\nis going to need to do that.\n\n91\n00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,830\nSo once you become\ncertified you're not done.\n\n92\n00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,878\nNew versions of CEH will come out and\nthey'll update to encompass whatever's\n\n93\n00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:26,170\nnew, you know, the high level attacks and\nthings that are out there.\n\n94\n00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,710\nAll gets wrapped up in the exam.\n\n95\n00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,678\nIt's good knowledge to have.\n\n96\n00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,890\nNow the ITProTV show that we're\nabout to film is all designed to\n\n97\n00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,810\nhelp you on that certification journey.\n\n98\n00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,790\nSome of you may already have a lot of\nexperience from out there in the field\n\n99\n00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,500\nfrom working in IT.\n\n100\n00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,890\nOthers might have attended\nthe official CEH course and\n\n101\n00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,170\nare getting ready to take the exam.\n\n102\n00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,890\nOthers still might have no\nexperience whatsoever and\n\n103\n00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,170\nare just wanting to get\nyour feet wet in security.\n\n104\n00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,600\nWell, this show kind of\ncovers a lot of those bases.\n\n105\n00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,520\nWe're going to go through all of\nthe domains that are covered on\n\n106\n00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,730\nthe EC Council's official exam objectives.\n\n107\n00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,420\nWe'll get a chance to see each of those\ntopics, what they mean, what they do.\n\n108\n00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,670\nAnd Sean's got some great labs built up,\n\n109\n00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,030\nwhere you'll actually get to see a lot\nof this in practice and it's really,\n\n110\n00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,740\nreally valuable in moving you\nforward with your exam studies.\n\n111\n00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,350\nAnd once you're ready, once you feel you\nhave all that knowledge, then go and\n\n112\n00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,460\ntake that exam and\nbecome a certified ethical hacker.\n\n113\n00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,850\nWell Sean, I think that's about\nall I've got here for my overview.\n\n114\n00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,830\nCan you think of anything else\nwe should throw in just as a,\n\n115\n00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,000\na final word of warning before\nsomebody watches the show?\n\n116\n00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,670\n>> I, I would like to, you know,\nreinforce what you were saying.\n\n117\n00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,240\nOne of the points you were saying is that\nyes, you do need to be prepared to not\n\n118\n00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,550\njust listen to the lectures and see the\ndemos I am going to be doing here for you.\n\n119\n00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,040\nBut you also need to be prepared to do\nthis on your, to do this on your own,\n\n120\n00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,690\nto do some exploration, to be curious,\nto further your own knowledge.\n\n121\n00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,290\nThose are key critical skills for\nanyone that's going into ethical hacking,\n\n122\n00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,280\nalso known as pen testing,\nthat they need to have.\n\n123\n00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,340\nSo you really want, you really want to be\nprepared to do that and commit to this.\n\n124\n00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,470\nA CEH is definitely not something that can\nbe considered a paper credential, you just\n\n125\n00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,810\ncan't get a piece of paper and say you've\ngot it, you will have to prove it.\n\n126\n00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,730\n>> And you know we had a comment in\nthe chatroom about someone who's got\n\n127\n00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,640\nalready got another\nEC Council certification and\n\n128\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560\nit reminded me of something\nI did want to mention.\n\n129\n00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,710\nThe exam cost, the exam cost is\nadvertised as $500 on most sites and\n\n130\n00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,510\none of the things that isn't necessarily\nmentioned is the exam cost is $500 if\n\n131\n00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,455\nyou take the official EC Council training\nthrough an authorized training center.\n\n132\n00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:30,300\nITProTV is not one of those authorized\ntraining centers so when you take\n\n133\n00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,980\nthe training with us you're considered\nwhat's called a self study student.\n\n134\n00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,600\nAnd the exam cost for a self study\nstudent is a little bit higher.\n\n135\n00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,670\nThey actually charge $600 for those.\n\n136\n00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,290\nSo be aware there is an exam cost.\n\n137\n00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,370\nNow if you just want to\nlearn the content and\n\n138\n00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,040\nhave an understanding of the technologies,\nwe've got you covered,\n\n139\n00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,250\nwe'll walk through it all,\nyou'll get a chance to learn that.\n\n140\n00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,520\nBut be aware that for the exam, if you\nactually want to get certified there\n\n141\n00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,030\nis an exam fee and you've got to register\nthrough EC Council to take the exam.\n\n142\n00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,060\nYou do not take the exam through\nIT Pro TV, it's not ours.\n\n143\n00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,190\nIt's EC Council's exam and\nyou take it through them.\n\n144\n00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,020\nAll right, but,\nif that all sounds exciting to you,\n\n145\n00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,620\nif that's exactly what\nyou want to learn and\n\n146\n00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,420\nyou are pumped up about it, then you\nare absolutely in the right place.\n\n147\n00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,210\nStay tuned because we've\ngot CEH episodes coming up.\n\n148\n00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,340\nIf you're a little worried\nabout being in over your head,\n\n149\n00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,210\nmaybe this isn't the right\ncertification for you.\n\n150\n00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,720\nWell, there's other certifications\nthat are available and\n\n151\n00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,810\nas an ITProTV subscriber,\nyou have access to our entire library.\n\n152\n00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,970\nIf you're just getting started in IT,\n\n153\n00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,330\nyou'll find the CEH is gonna be\nover your head a lot of it is.\n\n154\n00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,470\nSo I encourage you to jump over and\n\n155\n00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,020\ncheck out other certifications\nlike CompTIA A+ or Network+.\n\n156\n00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,050\nIf you're just getting started in\nsecurity, a great stepping stone for you,\n\n157\n00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,455\na great beginning point is,\nwell A+, Net+ again,\n\n158\n00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:41,545\nthey actually have security\nsections if you're really basic.\n\n159\n00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,175\nIf you've been working\nin the field though,\n\n160\n00:07:43,175 --> 00:07:46,765\nthe CompTIA Security+ is a great\ncertification to get started with.\n\n161\n00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:49,005\nBut if you're already out there in IT,\nyou're already working,\n\n162\n00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,495\nyou're ready to learn\nthe really exciting stuff.\n\n163\n00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:55,250\nCEH is the place to be, and\nthat's where we're starting after this\n\n164\n00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,469\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,710\nAnd welcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,130\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,800\nHow you doing today Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,980\n>> Not too bad, how you doing?\n\n9\n00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,300\n>> I'm doing fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,170\nGuys, I know that you guys out there\nare excited as we are here because we\n\n11\n00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,520\nare getting ready to start our CEH show.\n\n12\n00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,920\nFantastic, I know a lot of you\nhave been requesting this.\n\n13\n00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,380\nIt's been on our radar for a long time,\n\n14\n00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,340\nand we're finally getting\naround to getting it done.\n\n15\n00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,110\nAnd not only are we gonna be doing CEH,\nbut we are lucky enough to have Mr.\n\n16\n00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,320\nSean Oriyano with us today.\n\n17\n00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,590\nSean is the author of a book that's\npublished by Sybex called CEH,\n\n18\n00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,878\nCertified Ethical Hacker Version\n8 Study Guide.\n\n19\n00:01:14,878 --> 00:01:15,718\n>> Woo hoo!\n\n20\n00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:19,865\n>> [LAUGH] So we're going to be using\nthat as our guide as we go through these\n\n21\n00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:22,830\nepisodes, so\nI'm glad you guys are with us.\n\n22\n00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,540\nWe are gonna get started and Sean,\n\n23\n00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,400\nwe're basically going to\nfollow your book along, right?\n\n24\n00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,270\nWe're just gonna.\n\n25\n00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,450\n>> Yes, that's the intention is to go and\nfollow the book.\n\n26\n00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,490\nAnd the reason why that was done\nis it's something that's easy and\n\n27\n00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,570\naccessible to everybody.\n\n28\n00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:43,340\nIf you happen to have a access to the\nofficial CEH materials which I understand\n\n29\n00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,310\nsome of you might have, you can actually\nuse that to follow along with this too.\n\n30\n00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,590\nKind of somewhat.\n\n31\n00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,610\nBut not everyone has access to that, so\n\n32\n00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,270\nI want to give something\neveryone has access to use.\n\n33\n00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,625\nI also want to find a way to\nincrease my royalties on that,\n\n34\n00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,300\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n35\n00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,890\n>> So there's that too [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely, and\n\n36\n00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,635\nI know some of you have read it about\ntwice already in the last couple of weeks.\n\n37\n00:02:05,635 --> 00:02:08,560\nSome of you have already gone out and\nbought the book to follow along with\n\n38\n00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,630\nthe show and if you can that's great,\nbecause we're gonna be like I said,\n\n39\n00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,015\nwe're going to be going through this,\nwe've got some great episodes lined up.\n\n40\n00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:18,083\nWe're going to be obviously going\nthrough all this CEH material.\n\n41\n00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,180\nSean's got a bunch of labs set up for\nus, so\n\n42\n00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,960\nwe're going to be able to play around and\ntry some of these tools.\n\n43\n00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,430\nHope you guys are, like I said, hope you\nguys are excited as we are to be here.\n\n44\n00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,560\nOne thing I do want to point out,\n\n45\n00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,990\nyou guys know you've watched\nother episodes with us hopefully.\n\n46\n00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,910\nYou know you guys can ask questions\nlive during the show in that chatroom.\n\n47\n00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,770\nWe do have a large amount of viewers for\nthis show.\n\n48\n00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,620\nGreat to have everybody here but it also\nmeans that chatroom's going to be rolling\n\n49\n00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,180\na little bit quick as\nthese questions fire off.\n\n50\n00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,000\nSo, I've got some people on the sidelines,\nwatching the chat room as well.\n\n51\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,660\nSo, if you pop a question out there and\nI don't see it or\n\n52\n00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,290\nwe don't get to it right away, don't\nworry, I've got people on the sidelines\n\n53\n00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,180\nwriting those questions down,\nthey'll be giving them to us on break and\n\n54\n00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,910\nwe'll make sure we get\nyour question answered.\n\n55\n00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,620\nSo, ask your questions, if we don't get\nto it, don't fear we will come to it.\n\n56\n00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,710\nWith that being said, I say we dive\nright in and get started with some CEH,\n\n57\n00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,590\nwhat do you think?\n\n58\n00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,390\n>> Let's do it?\n\n59\n00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,160\n>> All right let's do it.\n\n60\n00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,300\nSo we're gonna start\noff our first episode.\n\n61\n00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,414\nWe're kinda getting started\nwith ethical hacking and\n\n62\n00:03:16,414 --> 00:03:20,550\ntalking a little bit about the history\nof hacking and some terminology.\n\n63\n00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,087\nI think it's just some foundational\nknowledge that we really need before we\n\n64\n00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:26,253\nmove on and\nprogress to the rest of the course.\n\n65\n00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,713\n>> Exactly, so.\n\n66\n00:03:29,713 --> 00:03:32,840\n>> Yeah, so where should we start?\n\n67\n00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,800\nif we wanna be, we wanna take this\nCEH class we wanna go out there and\n\n68\n00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,390\nget certified.\n\n69\n00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,690\nWhere do we start?\n\n70\n00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,510\nWhat is the first thing we gotta go over?\n\n71\n00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,760\n>> Well we really need\nto kind of position,\n\n72\n00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,000\nwhat ethical hacking actually is because\nthat can be kind of a crazy term.\n\n73\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,270\n>> It's kind of an oxymoron there.\n\n74\n00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,140\nIsn't it a little bit?\n\n75\n00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,280\nEthical hacking, wait a second,\nhow do those two fit together?\n\n76\n00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,830\n>> It's like trying to say hey,\nyou're a murderer with morals.\n\n77\n00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,290\nIt just doesn't work.\n\n78\n00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,560\nSo it's important to kinda position that.\n\n79\n00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,700\nTo me when I hear\nthe term ethical hacking,\n\n80\n00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,720\nI tend to think of it more than\na marketing term more than anything.\n\n81\n00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,890\nIn the field we don't call ourselves\nethical hackers, for the most part.\n\n82\n00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,355\nPeople outside the field,\n\n83\n00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:20,800\nwho are familiar with that term because\nthey see it in a book or someplace.\n\n84\n00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,270\nThen we will go ahead and use that, but\n\n85\n00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,720\ntypically we call ourselves penetration\ntesters or pen testers for short, and.\n\n86\n00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,650\n>> People seem to have a bad connotation\nwith that word, hacker, right?\n\n87\n00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,450\nAll the movies and\nthe overblown news stories and\n\n88\n00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,690\nthings like that and you go and\nput on your resume, I'm an ethical hacker.\n\n89\n00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,245\nI think some of those people look at\nthe word hacker and stop right there.\n\n90\n00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:43,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and that's exactly right.\n\n91\n00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,372\nWhen you call yourself a hacker,\n\n92\n00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:50,675\nyou're putting that stink on you,\nis the way I phrase it.\n\n93\n00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:54,031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You put yourself in an immediate\n\n94\n00:04:54,031 --> 00:04:54,850\ncategory.\n\n95\n00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,610\nPeople have the saying, right or wrong.\n\n96\n00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,930\nThanks to Hollywood, and the media,\nand a lot of bad things happening.\n\n97\n00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,370\nOn top of that,\nthey have an idea what a hacker is.\n\n98\n00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,060\nSo if you, if someone calls themselves\na hacker it raises eyebrows.\n\n99\n00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,000\nPeople aren't gonna ask white hat,\nblack hat, gray hat.\n\n100\n00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,400\nThey're not gonna ask that.\n\n101\n00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,370\nSo I think it's important\nto think about that.\n\n102\n00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,100\nIt's fine to put something like the CEH or\nsort of a ethical hacker on your resume,\n\n103\n00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,940\nbut I would not recommend going\naround calling yourself a hacker.\n\n104\n00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,930\nYou know,\ncall yourself a penetration tester.\n\n105\n00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,460\n>> Maybe amongst your friends,\nand stuff like that.\n\n106\n00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,382\n>> Secret handshake, fist bump,\nsomething like that, do it.\n\n107\n00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:37,310\n>> All right, so where did this term,\nyou know, where did hacking start out?\n\n108\n00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,440\nWhat's our history behind that?\n\n109\n00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,030\nThat's another great thing to talk\nabout is where did hacking start, and\n\n110\n00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,830\nI tend to look at,\nI've done some research and\n\n111\n00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,900\nI tend to look at it as something\nthat has always been around.\n\n112\n00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,680\nPeople have always found\ndifferent ways and new and\n\n113\n00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,060\nunique ways to use really any piece of\ntechnology or anything out there at all.\n\n114\n00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,316\nBut if you want to kind of go\nonto by what's on the books,\n\n115\n00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:09,749\nthey will tell you that hacking started\nat MIT way back when with the guys\n\n116\n00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:15,456\nthat were in a hobby club and saw\nthe computers, the mainframes on campus,\n\n117\n00:06:15,456 --> 00:06:20,540\nand they started using those and\nstarted poking around those.\n\n118\n00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,672\nIt kind of evolved from there.\n\n119\n00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,740\nPeople have a curiosity and\n\n120\n00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,280\nthen going on from being a curiosity\nto messing with people and\n\n121\n00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,120\nthen it evolved into the criminal\nelement and curiosity was still there.\n\n122\n00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,550\nSo it just kept evolving, but you know,\nhackers have always traditionally been\n\n123\n00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,220\npeople are, the common thread is\nthat they're tech enthusiasts.\n\n124\n00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,430\nAnd there are people\nthat are very curious and\n\n125\n00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,680\ndon't really like to play by the rules.\n\n126\n00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,190\nLet's color outside the line a lot.\n\n127\n00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,355\nThat's kind of a brief history of it.\n\n128\n00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:54,220\n>> Nice, nice, so\nwhen we talk about ethical hacking.\n\n129\n00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,440\nWhere does this role of\nethical hacking really fit in?\n\n130\n00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,360\n>> Ethical hacking, what a ethical hacker,\na position what it is that\n\n131\n00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,540\nyou can be expected to do after\nyou earn this credential,\n\n132\n00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,730\nput it in that context, is that you can\nbe expected to be the person that you're,\n\n133\n00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,700\nif your working for a company,\nto be called on by your company to\n\n134\n00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,290\ntest your infrastructure from the inside\n>> If you're working freelance,\n\n135\n00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,280\nyou may be called in or\ncontracted by companies to go and\n\n136\n00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,970\ntest their infrastructure from the outside\nto see it as a actual hacker would see it.\n\n137\n00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:35,330\nI myself have been tasked\nto do that where companies\n\n138\n00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,010\nhave their own people on\nstaff that can do this.\n\n139\n00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,320\nBut, they're not really,\nit's not a bad thing,\n\n140\n00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,970\nthey're not really gonna\nbe objective about it.\n\n141\n00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,667\nThey've got an emotional\nattachment to that stuff.\n\n142\n00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,833\n>> Right, right.\n\n143\n00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:53,586\n>> So what they'll do is they'll\ncall someone like me in who,\n\n144\n00:07:53,586 --> 00:07:57,208\nI've I'm an objective third party come in.\n\n145\n00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,050\nI don't have a horse in the race.\n\n146\n00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,905\nI just come in and do what I need to do.\n\n147\n00:08:01,905 --> 00:08:05,750\nSo, that gives a much better look at\nwhat someone on the outside would see.\n\n148\n00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,720\nThat doesn't have the knowledge of\nwhat's going on inside the box.\n\n149\n00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,260\nAnd isn't gonna potentially cover up\n\n150\n00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,880\nthings that might be\na boo-boo that they made.\n\n151\n00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,170\n>> Yeah, that's a very good point cuz\nthe guy that's being paid by that company,\n\n152\n00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,110\nyou know I get my paycheck\nfrom this company and\n\n153\n00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,780\nnow they're asking me to\ntest our systems out.\n\n154\n00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,740\nIf I find a major vulnerability or\nsomething that I've overlooked,\n\n155\n00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,430\ndo I really want to tell\nthe bosses that I missed this?\n\n156\n00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,530\nOr do I want to say oh\nno everything's great?\n\n157\n00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,110\nAnd then go kinda fix it on the side,\nright?\n\n158\n00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,530\nAs where as they bring you in,\nyou don't have that same obligation or\n\n159\n00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,580\nthat desire that need to kinda hide\nsome boo-boo that you might have made.\n\n160\n00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,340\n>> Exactly.\n\n161\n00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,760\nExactly, objectivity does\nplay a big role in this.\n\n162\n00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,510\nAnd I think you hit the nail\non the head with that,\n\n163\n00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,240\nis that if you're someone that works for\nthat company,\n\n164\n00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,700\nyou've kind of got that thing of,\nwell oops, there's a mistake here.\n\n165\n00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,111\nIf I tell someone about that mistake\nmaybe I'm going to get [NOISE] you know.\n\n166\n00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,856\n>> Yeah, that could be my last day.\n\n167\n00:08:58,856 --> 00:08:59,559\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, and so\n\n168\n00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,210\nthat actually has been known to happen.\n\n169\n00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,600\nSo that's why a lot of the smart\ncompanies will use both.\n\n170\n00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,640\n>> Right.\n>> And that's why some\n\n171\n00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,511\nlegal regulations say you have\nto use an external one as well.\n\n172\n00:09:09,511 --> 00:09:11,425\n>> That's true a lot of those industry and\n\n173\n00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,253\ngovernmental regulations say look you've\ngotta be tested but you can't have\n\n174\n00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:19,320\nsomebody in-house test it because we're\nnot going to trust those results per se.\n\n175\n00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,278\n>> Exactly.\n\n176\n00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:21,860\n>> All right, well good.\n\n177\n00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,500\nSo we know where our ethical hacking role\nfits in, let's talk about some of those\n\n178\n00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,850\ncore security concepts that\nwe need to be familiar with.\n\n179\n00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,430\nThe core things that you\nneed to be familiar with and\n\n180\n00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,590\nwhere it fits in with ethical hacking.\n\n181\n00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,170\nThere are some things we need\nto know right out of the gate.\n\n182\n00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,180\nWhen you are an ethical hacker,\n\n183\n00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,820\nwhat you are trying to do is you're\ntrying to disrupt or see where\n\n184\n00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,780\nthe weaknesses are in a company's\nsecurity model or security stance.\n\n185\n00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,790\nYou know but there's a term in there\nthat we kind of need to define.\n\n186\n00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,966\nYou may not realize it, but\nsecurity, what does that mean?\n\n187\n00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:58,650\n>> Uh-huh..\n\n188\n00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,530\n>> Security is one of those things that,\nyou know that anyone around can tell you,\n\n189\n00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,305\noh, security,\nthey've got something in their mind, but\n\n190\n00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:09,123\nif you ask them to describe it,\nyou're going to get different answers.\n\n191\n00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:10,405\n>> Yeah, that's kind of funny.\n\n192\n00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:13,675\nWhen you said that, I was just thinking,\nhow would I define security,\n\n193\n00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:15,145\nand I actually got a little\ntongue tied for a second.\n\n194\n00:10:15,145 --> 00:10:15,850\nI was like, wait.\n\n195\n00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,580\nWhat would I say?\n\n196\n00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,240\nAnd it really does depend on context,\non what you are talking about.\n\n197\n00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,370\nSo in this case how would you define it.\n\n198\n00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,300\n>> Well, the way you define security here,\nor the best way to define it for\n\n199\n00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,970\nwhat we are doing,\nis it's a state where only things that you\n\n200\n00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,020\nwant to happen occur, that you explicitly\nsay are allowed to happen occur.\n\n201\n00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,330\nIf you don't explicitly say that you want\nsomething to happen, it doesn't happen.\n\n202\n00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,870\nI know that's a very short answer\nthat may not be the answer that\n\n203\n00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:52,050\nall of you are looking for, but\nthat's usually the way it goes.\n\n204\n00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,520\nThere's other ways that people phrase it,\ntoo.\n\n205\n00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,850\nI've heard a state of well-being.\n\n206\n00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,520\nAnd I'd just wanna sit and mm, meditate or\nsomething, or light some incense or\n\n207\n00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,630\nsomething.\n\n208\n00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,680\nIt's like, okay, if they wanna call it\na state of well-being, go ahead, but you\n\n209\n00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,340\nreally look at it as something where only\nthings that you wanna have happen, happen.\n\n210\n00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,736\nThat tends to be a universal\nthing that happens in there.\n\n211\n00:11:17,736 --> 00:11:21,040\n>> Yeah, really, when we're talking\nabout security, we'll say that one\n\n212\n00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,556\nof our roles in the IT field as well as\nbeing a certified ethical hacker is making\n\n213\n00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:28,280\nsure that our end users have access to\nthese resources in a secure fashion.\n\n214\n00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,570\nBut we don't necessarily mean encrypted or\nanything like that.\n\n215\n00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,950\nWhen we say in a secure fashion that\nmeans if they're supposed to have access,\n\n216\n00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,520\nthey do.\n\n217\n00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,740\nIf they don't, if they're not\nsupposed to have access, they don't.\n\n218\n00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,880\nAnd that their access is controlled,\nright?\n\n219\n00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,380\nIf they're supposed to have read access,\nthat's all they can do,\n\n220\n00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,020\nand they can't make those write\nchanges and things like that.\n\n221\n00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,960\nAnd they can't get into places\nthat they shouldn't be,\n\n222\n00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,560\nor access information that is not their\npay grade, for example, or what have you.\n\n223\n00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,020\nMake sure they get what they need\nto do their job and nothing more.\n\n224\n00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,663\n>> Exactly.\nI like the way you're going on this,\n\n225\n00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:03,420\nyou're setting me up perfectly for\nthis so we're a team here, stick with me.\n\n226\n00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,529\n>> [LAUGH] Give me some love, poom.\n\n227\n00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,880\n>> There's this concept that\nI'm sure a lot of you know.\n\n228\n00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,470\nThey call it CIA.\n\n229\n00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,510\nIt's pretty much taught in every\nsecurity course out there.\n\n230\n00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,410\nI'm sure there's a lot of you\nthat have heard it before.\n\n231\n00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,860\nLet's just go ahead and\nmake sure we're all on the same page here.\n\n232\n00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,980\n>> Right.\n\n233\n00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,450\n>> CIA is the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n234\n00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,600\n>> The whole triad.\n\n235\n00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000\n>> Yeah, the CIA triad, exactly.\n\n236\n00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,750\nThe CIA triad says that, first of all,\nconfidentiality if, like you said,\n\n237\n00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,650\nif you're supposed to have access to\nsomething, you do have access to it.\n\n238\n00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,600\nIf you don't, if you're not supposed\nto have access, you don't get access.\n\n239\n00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,640\nIt's a simple thing.\n\n240\n00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,870\nSo we have that.\n\n241\n00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,650\nWe're trying to make\nsure we preserve that.\n\n242\n00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,820\nThe next thing we have is\nthe integrity portion.\n\n243\n00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,720\nThe integrity portion quite simply means\nthat if you put information someplace\n\n244\n00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,460\nin a certain state, you have a way of\nchecking that it still is in that state.\n\n245\n00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:11,280\nThat it hasn't been modified by\nsomeone in unauthorized fashion.\n\n246\n00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,060\n>> Yeah it really could be\neither malicious modification or\n\n247\n00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,112\neven unintentional, right?\n\n248\n00:13:15,112 --> 00:13:16,760\nJust corruption and things like that.\n\n249\n00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,530\n>> And when we talk about integrity,\nmaking sure that data remains intact, and\n\n250\n00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,350\nthe way we meant it to be.\n\n251\n00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,740\n>> And\nwe don't even distinguish like that.\n\n252\n00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,610\nThat's a great point.\n\n253\n00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,390\nThat malicious or accidental,\nwe don't even distinguish.\n\n254\n00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,990\nA change is a change.\n\n255\n00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,700\nNow as an ethical hacker, and\na security manager inside a company yes,\n\n256\n00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,660\nwe do have to worry about whether\nit's malicious or accidental.\n\n257\n00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,410\nBecause that's going to tell\nus what our remediation is.\n\n258\n00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,350\n>> But at this stage,\nwe're not gonna distinguish it too much.\n\n259\n00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,500\nBut then to move on to the last one,\navailability.\n\n260\n00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,250\nAvailability is really another important\none that interestingly enough,\n\n261\n00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,620\nI see people forget about this one.\n\n262\n00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,100\n>> It does get overlooked a lot,\ndoesn't it?\n\n263\n00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,960\nIt really does.\n\n264\n00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,130\nCuz it's not the exciting part\nof it I think, or something.\n\n265\n00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,280\nBut, it's an important part of it, right?\n\n266\n00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,960\nBecause if my users, if my data is secure,\nbut they can't get access to what they\n\n267\n00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,070\nneed to do their job, that data\ndoesn't do me a lot of good, does it?\n\n268\n00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,960\n>> 100% true.\n\n269\n00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,000\nThat's absolutely true.\n\n270\n00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,530\nI've had some funny encounters over\nthe years, in class and otherwise.\n\n271\n00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,550\nAnd I remember having one case where\nI had a student that was saying,\n\n272\n00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,180\nwell I can make something really secure\nand it's one of those things where\n\n273\n00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,750\nhe's just trying to test you\nto see how far it can go.\n\n274\n00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,110\nAnd he says well I'm gonna dig a hole in\nthe ground and throw my computer in it and\n\n275\n00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,290\nI'm going to dump concrete on it and\nthat way it's confidentiality and\n\n276\n00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,730\nintegrity is preserved.\n\n277\n00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,920\nBut that's not the case.\n\n278\n00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:49,670\nIt's like,\nwhat about the little a on the end?\n\n279\n00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,165\nIt was a good example of,\nwhen you look at CIA,\n\n280\n00:14:53,165 --> 00:14:57,320\nthere's going to be some balance\nthat you're gonna have to determine.\n\n281\n00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,010\nI can't determine that here,\nyou know, for you.\n\n282\n00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,750\nI can't tell you what that\nbalance of CIA is gonna be.\n\n283\n00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,970\nYou have to do what's called\na risk analysis to figure out,\n\n284\n00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,890\nwhat your exposure is, and\nwhat your risk tolerance is.\n\n285\n00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,930\nWe can't do that here.\n\n286\n00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,240\nWe can give you the tools to figure that,\nbut\n\n287\n00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,890\nwe can't actually tell you\nwhat it's going to be.\n\n288\n00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,960\n>> Each situation is going to be different\ndepending on the data you're trying to\n\n289\n00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,830\nprotect and\nwho you're trying to protect it from.\n\n290\n00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,890\nIt's gonna change on\nsituation to situation so\n\n291\n00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,700\nI'm saying we can learn how to\ntake care of all these things.\n\n292\n00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,760\nHow to provide confidentiality,\nhow to provide integrity.\n\n293\n00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,500\nHow to provide availability and\nthen you've gotta find that balance of,\n\n294\n00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,480\ndo I need more confidentiality and less\navailability, or how do we want to do it.\n\n295\n00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,420\nAnd I like your story like that student\nwas saying, because it really is,\n\n296\n00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,240\nI always looked at it like a tripod.\n\n297\n00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,620\nYou've got three legs of that tripod.\n\n298\n00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,875\nIf you leave one of those legs out,\nyou are not going to stand up too long.\n\n299\n00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:53,003\nSo you've got to have all three\nof those parts, the CIA triad,\n\n300\n00:15:53,003 --> 00:15:55,910\nthe confidentiality and\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n301\n00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,875\n>> Exactly.\n\n302\n00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:04,860\nAnd I'll add on to that that little\nmodel that my student just handed to me.\n\n303\n00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,950\nHe handed that to me on a silver platter.\n\n304\n00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,850\nI was like, thank you.\n\n305\n00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,370\nYou know, he hands it to me.\n\n306\n00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,210\nWhat he did was is when he handed that\nexample to me tells me I'm going to\n\n307\n00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,970\npour concrete on it, you know there's\na lot of things we can learn from that.\n\n308\n00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,310\nWhen you look at that it's you know,\nyes so\n\n309\n00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,530\nyou put something in concrete in\nthe ground, it's not available, but\n\n310\n00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:28,640\nthen there's something else to\nreally take away from that.\n\n311\n00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,030\nCould you still get access to that system?\n\n312\n00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:33,610\n>> Yes.\nSomeone else in that class actually said\n\n313\n00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,240\nwell, I'll just get a jackhammer.\n\n314\n00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,480\n>> Enough effort and\nthey might be able to get in there.\n\n315\n00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,880\n>> Absolutely, and so\nsomething that we have to learn.\n\n316\n00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,910\n>> When we do any sort of\ninformation security hacking and\n\n317\n00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:50,810\nsuggesting stuff to a client, is that\nthere is no such thing as 100% security.\n\n318\n00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,905\nYou will not ever obtain that, it's just\nsomething that you have to get used to.\n\n319\n00:16:55,905 --> 00:17:01,135\nYou can get close, and\nhow close you get depends on the time and\n\n320\n00:17:01,135 --> 00:17:04,955\nmoney you want to invest, but\nyou may not need to get that close.\n\n321\n00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:09,375\nYou have to determine what's a good\nlevel of risk for you to have.\n\n322\n00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,820\nAnd how much your budget is.\n\n323\n00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,610\nNow it's time you have to do that.\n\n324\n00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:19,304\nAnd you're always gonna be given maybe,\nwe shouldn't say always, but\n\n325\n00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:24,650\na lot of times you're not be given all\nthe time and money and stuff you need.\n\n326\n00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,280\nYou're going to be,\nget one of those if you're lucky.\n\n327\n00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,620\nIt always makes me laugh cause you talk\nabout you're going into an organization.\n\n328\n00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,560\nAnd you go in there and tell them that\nthis is what you really need to do and\n\n329\n00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,730\nthis might be your best bet.\n\n330\n00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,520\nAnd they want it to be 100% bulletproof,\nbut\n\n331\n00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,290\nthey never want to get off\nthat wallet like they need to.\n\n332\n00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,480\nSometimes you have to make\nthose compromises in there too.\n\n333\n00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,360\nAnd like you said,\nit really comes back, and\n\n334\n00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,323\nI know we've got it in\na later chapter in your book.\n\n335\n00:17:46,323 --> 00:17:48,640\nWe're going to talk about\nthat risk analysis, but\n\n336\n00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,910\nthat's really what it comes down to,\nright.\n\n337\n00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,200\nDeciding how valuable the data is,\n\n338\n00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,016\nhow much it's going to cost your\norganization if you lose that data.\n\n339\n00:17:57,016 --> 00:18:00,520\nAnd that's going to determine how\nmuch effort you're willing to put in\n\n340\n00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,670\nto mitigate those risks.\n\n341\n00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,870\n>> There you go.\n\n342\n00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:11,770\nThere's something else we can mix\ninto this initial model here.\n\n343\n00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:16,600\nThere's other things that\nsecurity could impact directly.\n\n344\n00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,990\nSecurity definitely is something,\n\n345\n00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,780\nthe way we lock down our systems and\nkeep certain things from happening.\n\n346\n00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,700\nIn fact, to use our description\nfrom earlier to keep\n\n347\n00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,610\nactions that we don't want to occur,\nwe're keeping them from happening.\n\n348\n00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,500\nSo we've got that.\n\n349\n00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,690\nBut there's something\nelse that builds into it.\n\n350\n00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,320\nWhen you look at security, think of\nwho else might be in your company,\n\n351\n00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,680\nmight be interacting with security, or\nwould be interacting with security.\n\n352\n00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,110\nWho do you might think be another one?\n\n353\n00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,100\nOther than the bad guys,\nwho might else be interacting?\n\n354\n00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,710\n>> I got all my employees who are going\nto be accessing those resources.\n\n355\n00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,820\n>> And there you go.\n\n356\n00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,160\nYour employees are definitely\ngoing to be interacting with that.\n\n357\n00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,590\nNow, your employees,\nyou authorize them and\n\n358\n00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,420\ngive them a certain level of trust to\naccess these resources internally.\n\n359\n00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,470\nWell the thing is that's all well and\ngood,\n\n360\n00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,240\nthat's what you want to have, but\nas a security person you also have to\n\n361\n00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,860\nthink of the fact that while you\nmay want to build Fort Knox and\n\n362\n00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,100\nlock everything down, that doesn't\nmake things convenient to use.\n\n363\n00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,930\nThat really does it, so you can put\nall these nice, fancy, top of the line\n\n364\n00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,200\nsecurity things, if you had an unlimited\nbudget, I'm sure you would.\n\n365\n00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,855\nBut the thing is,\nthat does not make a system.\n\n366\n00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:30,565\nEasy to use.\n\n367\n00:19:30,565 --> 00:19:33,785\nSomeone had, at the end of the day,\nthat's not a security person,\n\n368\n00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:38,565\nthat's not the same mindset that you, has\nto go in there and work with that system.\n\n369\n00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:43,327\nAnd if it's not easy to use,\nthere's some bad things that can happen.\n\n370\n00:19:43,327 --> 00:19:47,727\nYou know and a number of bad things that\ncan happen that a company doesn't want to\n\n371\n00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:51,907\nhave occur you know you've got\nproductivity being impacted cause people\n\n372\n00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:55,887\nare making calls and stuff like\nthat relating to how they use this.\n\n373\n00:19:55,887 --> 00:20:01,400\nYou know you have just things just\noverall just slowing down or stopping and\n\n374\n00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,960\nthen there's something else\nthat can be a very bad thing.\n\n375\n00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,790\nVery bad thing that we\ngotta mix into this.\n\n376\n00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,590\nIf security gets too complicated for\nthe average user to interact with.\n\n377\n00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:17,420\nLet's say you decide it's a smart\nidea to use 14 character passwords.\n\n378\n00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,880\nYou just came in one day and\nsaid to heck with it, we're doing it.\n\n379\n00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,740\n>> I mean the longer,\nthe stronger, the better, right?\n\n380\n00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,360\n>> Exactly right.\n\n381\n00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,780\n>> You have nothing to do but\nimprove my security.\n\n382\n00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,270\n8 is good, 10 is good, you know 14,\nyou know, that's awesome.\n\n383\n00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,680\nYou know, heck let's do 18.\n\n384\n00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,920\nYou decide you want to do that.\n\n385\n00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,490\n>> And\nchange it every 20 days while we're at it.\n\n386\n00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,310\n>> 20 what are you crazy?\n\n387\n00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:37,960\n10.\n>> There we go.\n\n388\n00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,350\n>> So, if you decide you want to do that,\n\n389\n00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,050\nthat may be good from your standpoint,\nbut.\n\n390\n00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,980\nThe average Joe is going to\nlook at that and say, well okay\n\n391\n00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,070\nyou told me I have to use an 18 character\npassword well where's that piece of paper,\n\n392\n00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,290\nand they're going to write it down.\n\n393\n00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,930\n>> And that's going to be taped to the\nmonitor or the underside of the keyboard,\n\n394\n00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,130\nor something like that.\n\n395\n00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,530\n>> You have to think about that.\n\n396\n00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,720\n>> You really didn't increase security.\n\n397\n00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,920\nYou actually hurt your security\nby taking it to that next level.\n\n398\n00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,900\nIt's almost like it's a sliding scale and\nyou've gotta find that balance\n\n399\n00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,410\npoint between security and\nconvenience or ease of use.\n\n400\n00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,860\nYeah, absolutely correct\nis that there is this\n\n401\n00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,710\nbalance of how many features you enable,\nand\n\n402\n00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:22,210\nwhat functionality you have,\nas well as how secure the system is.\n\n403\n00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,160\nAnd you're going to have\nto find out what that is.\n\n404\n00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,270\nAnd that can be a very tricky thing.\n\n405\n00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,300\nIt's like balancing on\nknife's edge at some points.\n\n406\n00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,400\nBecause, you know, you can go too far\none way or too far the other way.\n\n407\n00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,810\nI in some cases and I don't [INAUDIBLE].\n\n408\n00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,080\nIn some cases I look at this and\nI say well, and\n\n409\n00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,265\nusers are kind of like a kids\n>> [LAUGH] right?\n\n410\n00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:50,255\n>> In some respect, and I get that,\nand I don't mean any offense by that.\n\n411\n00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:57,320\nBut sometimes I look at that cause\nI remember I had an instructor\n\n412\n00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,620\nin junior high that he was saying junior\nhigh students were like chickens.\n\n413\n00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,230\nHe said when you get into equipment\nthey just peck and peck and\n\n414\n00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,521\npeck at it until it breaks.\n\n415\n00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:07,305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so,\n\n416\n00:22:07,305 --> 00:22:09,825\nthat's kind of gotten in my\nhead after all these years.\n\n417\n00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:11,500\nEven now I think about that.\n\n418\n00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,910\nIn end users that way.\n\n419\n00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:18,285\nI'm not going to say they're chickens,\nbut I will say they'll peck at stuff and\n\n420\n00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:21,460\nplay with stuff until they\nfind a way around it.\n\n421\n00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,310\nSo you gotta find that balance.\n\n422\n00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,370\n>> It always amazed me.\n\n423\n00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,230\nI've had end users that couldn't figure\nout how to print their spreadsheet\n\n424\n00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,050\nin landscape format, but somehow they're\ngetting around my password policy or\n\n425\n00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,070\nsomething like that, it's mind boggling.\n\n426\n00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,370\nBut like you say if it's something that\nyou know that they will just hack on it,\n\n427\n00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,370\nor not hack on it, but they will just\ntry and try and try different ways,\n\n428\n00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:43,770\nthey'll ask their friends, or their kids\nwill give some kind of thing you should\n\n429\n00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,070\ntry this mom, you should just turn off\nyour Windows updates, it'll make your\n\n430\n00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,637\ncomputer run so much faster,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n431\n00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:49,833\n>> You know and things like that,\n\n432\n00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:50,480\nit's amazing.\n\n433\n00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,629\nSo it is important that we\nteach our end users I think and\n\n434\n00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:55,170\neverybody that we're all a part\nof security in the end, right?\n\n435\n00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,190\nThey have to their part in.\n\n436\n00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:00,550\nWe have to make sure that we\ndon't take security too far and\n\n437\n00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,803\nend up undermining our own efforts.\n\n438\n00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:09,520\nAnd it's something we need to also kind of\nroll into this whole thing with the end\n\n439\n00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,390\nusers nowadays and their ability to, their\ninteresting ability to get around things.\n\n440\n00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:19,500\nIs we do have this thing\ncalled the Internet of course,\n\n441\n00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,850\nand they know how to use it really well,\nthey may not know the final impact of what\n\n442\n00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,200\nthese things are, they just know that hey,\ngo to google, type some stuff in, and hey\n\n443\n00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,270\nthat's how to fix it, I don't need the IT\nguys or security guards telling me this.\n\n444\n00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,250\nI'll just go ahead and do it.\n\n445\n00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,850\nAnd they don't think of\nthe end consequences.\n\n446\n00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:39,100\nAnd so, you kinda need to be\nthinking about that, too,\n\n447\n00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:43,360\nthat you do have to more,\nI like to say, tech savy users.\n\n448\n00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,780\nBut the knowledge understanding\nlevel hasn't gone up as much.\n\n449\n00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,590\nSo, they know that they\ncan find the information,\n\n450\n00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,820\nbut they don't know what that\ninformation really means.\n\n451\n00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,560\nThey're fine with just saying, that\nscript on that news group, that's fine.\n\n452\n00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,470\nJust paste it in here.\n\n453\n00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,275\nThey don't know.\n\n454\n00:23:57,275 --> 00:23:59,526\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Meanwhile there's some guy\n\n455\n00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:04,417\nin somebody's basement someplace doing\nidentity theft and stuff like that.\n\n456\n00:24:04,417 --> 00:24:05,000\n>> Absolutely.\n\n457\n00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,542\nYep.\n\n458\n00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:08,375\nAnd so we have to factor these things in.\n\n459\n00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:10,967\n>> [LAUGH] Very good.\n\n460\n00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,008\nVery good.\n\n461\n00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:13,510\nThe fun we have in security field.\n\n462\n00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,050\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n463\n00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,970\n>> And dealing with end users.\n\n464\n00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,630\nAll right.\n\n465\n00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,990\nSo we've gone over a couple\nof key terms there.\n\n466\n00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,730\nWe've got that CIA triad.\n\n467\n00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,250\nWe've talked about ethical hacking.\n\n468\n00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,930\nAny other terms we want to hit?\n\n469\n00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,980\n>> Yes.\n\n470\n00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,430\nI'm gonna be sprinkling these\nterms out throughout the course.\n\n471\n00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:36,540\nAnd what I want to do is I want to\nintroduce something to you now.\n\n472\n00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,120\nAnd so you're aware of them.\n\n473\n00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,983\nMainly because not only because\nwe're going to be using them\n\n474\n00:24:40,983 --> 00:24:41,758\nthroughout the course.\n\n475\n00:24:41,758 --> 00:24:45,910\nBut also because they are terms you're\ngoing to see on your exam, okay?\n\n476\n00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:51,030\nSo what I'm trying to do here is\nI'm trying to kind of give you\n\n477\n00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:56,160\na little heads up here so\nyou can take notes on this if you need to.\n\n478\n00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,940\nAlso, if you got the book\nthey're in here as well.\n\n479\n00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,080\nAvailable at fine bookstores everywhere.\n\n480\n00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,930\nSo if you've got that\nyou've got the list too.\n\n481\n00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,008\n>> There's a nice glossary in there.\n\n482\n00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:09,560\nAnd I love all the exam tips\nyou throw out for there too.\n\n483\n00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,500\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n484\n00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,540\nBut let's talk about those terms.\n\n485\n00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:18,730\nOne of the terms we need\nto know is a vulnerability.\n\n486\n00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,210\nA vulnerability is probably one\nof the easier terms to grasp.\n\n487\n00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:28,550\nVulnerability is a defined weakness\nin your infrastructure organization.\n\n488\n00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:32,100\nIt could also be a defect or\nweakness in a policy.\n\n489\n00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,060\nLet's not forget that.\n\n490\n00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,150\n>> That's a good point.\n\n491\n00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:40,320\nIs that we're gonna spend a lot of time in\nthis course talking about technicals, and\n\n492\n00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,840\nthings of that nature.\n\n493\n00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,400\nBut it could be very easy for\nyou to attack a company's policy, or\n\n494\n00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,140\nthe loopholes in their policy.\n\n495\n00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,470\nHeck, it might be easy to go\nagainst their personnel, too.\n\n496\n00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,100\nThose are all definitely things\nwhere vulnerabilities can appear.\n\n497\n00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,650\nSo it's a weakness that we can\npotentially take advantage of.\n\n498\n00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:02,590\n>> We don't want to consider\na vulnerability just a weakness\n\n499\n00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,560\nin the computer system and the software.\n\n500\n00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,790\nThere's different vectors that\ncould have vulnerabilities.\n\n501\n00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,860\nPolicies can have vulnerabilities, and\nthe humans can have vulnerabilities.\n\n502\n00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,170\nWe'll talk more about that later,\nbut that's always a good one.\n\n503\n00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,090\nSo yeah, vulnerability.\n\n504\n00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,710\nNow one of the things,\nI don't know if you're going in next.\n\n505\n00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,380\nI don't want to get you off track here,\nbut\n\n506\n00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,160\nI always had a problem defining\nvulnerability versus threats.\n\n507\n00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,640\nAnd getting those guys, making sure\nI knew the difference between them.\n\n508\n00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,130\n>> Yeah, vulnerabilities and threats,\nthey're cousins, they really are.\n\n509\n00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:38,770\nA threat is a defined\nway to get into system,\n\n510\n00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,060\nto take advantage of a weakness, okay?\n\n511\n00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,860\nNow, I just said it.\n\n512\n00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:47,770\nA weakness and what I just defined,\nI defined a weakness as a vulnerability.\n\n513\n00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:54,020\nSo if you have a threat by itself and\nit's designed to take advantage of some\n\n514\n00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,380\nweakness or some defect in its system\nIt's only gonna be dangerous to you.\n\n515\n00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,630\nAnd we'll put a little\nasterisk next to that,\n\n516\n00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,120\nbecause there are some things that we\ncan kind of change this a bit latter on.\n\n517\n00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,400\nBut for right now a threat by itself\nisn't really that big of a problem.\n\n518\n00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,620\nBecause It's something that we need to\nbe aware of just in case the situation\n\n519\n00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,510\nchanges, but just having it doesn't\nmean we are concerned about it.\n\n520\n00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,780\nBecause what if you have a threat\nthat's against Apple's Safari browser?\n\n521\n00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,780\nMaybe you're not using\nan Apple Safari browser.\n\n522\n00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,710\nYou're not vulnerable.\n\n523\n00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:27,020\n>> So, the threat is more the action,\n\n524\n00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,470\nsomebody taking advantage\nof a vulnerability, maybe?\n\n525\n00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,430\n>> Exactly, so, if you have a threat\nagainst Internet Explorer, and\n\n526\n00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,890\nyou do have Internet Explorer and\nyou meet the criteria for that threat.\n\n527\n00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,640\nOnce you read everything then you've\ngot a potential lineup in there.\n\n528\n00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,820\nSo now you should be reading what that\nthreat is, what the weaknesses is and\n\n529\n00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,190\nsee what you can do to fix it and\naddress that.\n\n530\n00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,006\n>> OK, very good\n>> So\n\n531\n00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:51,341\nwe definitely want to make\nsure that we're aware of that.\n\n532\n00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:54,922\n>> Nice, all right, so we've got\nvulnerabilities, we've got threats,\n\n533\n00:27:54,922 --> 00:27:56,899\nwhat are some other terms we want to hit?\n\n534\n00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,855\n>> Well, just to make sure we have it,\nunderstand what risk is.\n\n535\n00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:08,620\nYou're always going to have some\nlevel of risk in any company.\n\n536\n00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:11,440\nAnd it's like they said,\nthere's risk with anything you do.\n\n537\n00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,690\nI could walk out in the street here today,\nand then slip and\n\n538\n00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:21,460\nfall or whatever so\nthere's always risk in everything you do.\n\n539\n00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,120\nIt's the same way with anything we do in\nsecurity you have to understand there's\n\n540\n00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,710\nalways going to be some level of risk.\n\n541\n00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:31,510\nWe just have to figure out what our pain\nthreshold is, is what I like to say.\n\n542\n00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:36,165\nOur pain threshold is, everyone's pain\nthreshold, not to be too macabre about it,\n\n543\n00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:38,568\neveryone's pain threshold is different.\n\n544\n00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:41,295\nSo what might be a little,\noh look, I got a little scratch,\n\n545\n00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:43,600\nmight be something that\nfreaks someone else out.\n\n546\n00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,530\nSame thing with companies, what might be\nan acceptable risk to one company is not\n\n547\n00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,210\ngoing to be acceptable for another one.\n\n548\n00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,520\nSo we really kinda gotta know\nwhat's an acceptable level for\n\n549\n00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,590\nus, and then build towards that.\n\n550\n00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,990\nYou know, so\nthat's a very very important thing.\n\n551\n00:28:58,990 --> 00:28:59,925\nGood good.\n\n552\n00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:03,945\nAll right, well we got some more key terms\nthat are gonna help us get through this\n\n553\n00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:06,470\ninformation and\nget through this exam coming up.\n\n554\n00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,330\nWe're running out of time for\nthis segment though so\n\n555\n00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,880\nwhy don't we take a quick break here.\n\n556\n00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,990\nWe come back, we'll hit some\nmore terms and keep moving on.\n\n557\n00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:13,720\nYou guys stay tuned.\n\n558\n00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,425\nWe'll be right back.\n\n559\n00:29:14,425 --> 00:29:20,966\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n560\n00:29:20,966 --> 00:29:22,780\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n561\n00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,000\nWe're in our first\nepisode of our CEH show.\n\n562\n00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,680\nHere with Mr. Sean Oriyano and we're\ngoing to jump back into our concept of,\n\n563\n00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,050\nwhy ethical hacking?\n\n564\n00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:37,090\nWhy is there a need in the first\nplace to have an ethical hacker?\n\n565\n00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,570\n>> This is the million dollar question,\nor whatever you want to call it.\n\n566\n00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:47,240\nThis is one of the big questions that\nwe have is, why is there this need for\n\n567\n00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,430\nan ethical hacker, or pen tester,\nif we want to use that term?\n\n568\n00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:56,290\nWhy is there such a big deal to have one\nof these and have the skills in training?\n\n569\n00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,450\nAnd the reason is,\nis that it's something that you eluded to,\n\n570\n00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,230\nMike, in another session\nin our previous segment.\n\n571\n00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,675\nHaving the tools basically of the enemy.\n\n572\n00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:15,162\nIt's understanding their techniques and\ntheir capabilities.\n\n573\n00:30:15,162 --> 00:30:18,337\nSo what we're doing is we\nare learning what they do,\n\n574\n00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:21,091\nhow they do it,\nwhat their motivations are.\n\n575\n00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:25,679\nAnd once we understand that, then we\ncan use them to assess our client or\n\n576\n00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,675\nour company if we work for one.\n\n577\n00:30:27,675 --> 00:30:32,474\nAnd see where those problems\nactually are if they exist, and\n\n578\n00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:37,300\nhelp close those holes before\nthe bad guys get in and do that.\n\n579\n00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,830\nReally when you look at an ethical\nhacker it's a good time to talk about\n\n580\n00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,340\nwhat separates an ethical\nhacker from a hacker.\n\n581\n00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,760\n>> And really it comes down to that whole\nlittle prefix on their ethics, right?\n\n582\n00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So even though ethics may be a small\n\n583\n00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,560\nportion of the exam,\nit's actually kind of funny.\n\n584\n00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,170\nIt's in the single digits,\nI don't know what the exact number,\n\n585\n00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,553\nas far as ethics in there.\n\n586\n00:31:00,553 --> 00:31:01,833\n>> 2% of the exam is on ethics.\n\n587\n00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:02,390\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah,\n\n588\n00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,480\nsomeone had said that in the chat room,\nits like, 2%.\n\n589\n00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,000\nBut, it's a small portion of it.\n\n590\n00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,270\n>> But the thing is, it's a small\nportion of what they talk about, but\n\n591\n00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,650\nit's black and white,\nis the way I look at it.\n\n592\n00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,670\n>> It's the foundation of all of this,\nright?\n\n593\n00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,010\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n594\n00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,800\nIt's saying that,\nwhile you do have all these skills and\n\n595\n00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,740\ntools of the bad guys, you won't\nuse them unless you have permission\n\n596\n00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,710\nfrom whoever the system\nowner is you're targeting.\n\n597\n00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,650\nSo, that's one big one.\n\n598\n00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,060\nYou never do things without permission\nif you're an ethical hacker,\n\n599\n00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,060\nif you're doing this.\n\n600\n00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,688\nWhat you can't do is you can't go\nthrough and read this book and\n\n601\n00:31:43,688 --> 00:31:47,258\nwatch this course and poke around and\ndecide, you know what?\n\n602\n00:31:47,258 --> 00:31:52,220\nIt's a good idea to go test this and\nsee what security is.\n\n603\n00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,080\nI don't care what your intentions are.\n\n604\n00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,980\nAnd I've actually had people,\nif you can believe, that argue that.\n\n605\n00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,780\n>> Really?\n\n606\n00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,551\n>> They argue that saying,\nwell, you know, it's fine.\n\n607\n00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,216\nHow am I supposed to practice this?\n\n608\n00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:04,083\nI wanna go out and try it and\ntry it out in the real world scenarios.\n\n609\n00:32:04,083 --> 00:32:08,115\n>> Or they're saying, oh, well,\nI found a security hole in such and\n\n610\n00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:09,917\nsuch company and I told them.\n\n611\n00:32:09,917 --> 00:32:11,668\nAnd they got upset, what the hell.\n\n612\n00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,125\nWhy did they get upset about it?\n\n613\n00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,660\nWell the thing is that we can change that.\n\n614\n00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,570\nAnd this is what I've done.\n\n615\n00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,510\nI've changed that discussion\na bit on people that say that.\n\n616\n00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,820\nI've said, so what you're saying is,\nif I go to your house and\n\n617\n00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,650\nkick the door in to see if there's no\ncovers on your electrical sockets,\n\n618\n00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,050\nit says it's not child safe.\n\n619\n00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,380\nAs long as they told you it's not\nchild safe and you know that now,\n\n620\n00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,760\nit's okay that I just kicked in your\ndoor and jacked up your house right?\n\n621\n00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,500\nAnd they're like no.\n\n622\n00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,325\nAnd I'm like see the issue here?\n\n623\n00:32:41,325 --> 00:32:45,130\nSo that's the thing,\nyou never do stuff without permission.\n\n624\n00:32:47,395 --> 00:32:50,415\nBy definition a bad guy hacker would.\n\n625\n00:32:50,415 --> 00:32:52,905\n>> Right.\n>> So that's an important thing.\n\n626\n00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:53,485\n>> Exactly.\n\n627\n00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:56,071\nIt's one of those things, guys,\nwe want to make sure you guys are safe and\n\n628\n00:32:56,071 --> 00:32:57,763\nthat you're not getting\nyourself in trouble.\n\n629\n00:32:57,763 --> 00:33:02,190\nAnd you're gonna hear the stories about\nhow, like you were saying, oh, I went and\n\n630\n00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,127\nI broke into this company's network and\nI got all these payroll reports.\n\n631\n00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,626\nAnd I took it in to 'em and\nI showed 'em what I was able to do and\n\n632\n00:33:08,626 --> 00:33:10,838\nnow I'm their security guy,\nright, they hired me.\n\n633\n00:33:10,838 --> 00:33:15,951\nThere might be one or two stories where\nthat might have happened, but odds are,\n\n634\n00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:21,310\nyou're gonna be in the jail, there's gonna\nbe some legal ramifications of that.\n\n635\n00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,620\nSo don't think you can just go out and\n\n636\n00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,390\nstart hacking on public networks or\nprivate companies and\n\n637\n00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,510\nthings like that, and impress somebody,\nand get a job out of it.\n\n638\n00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,320\n>> Yeah, definitely do not do that.\n\n639\n00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,820\nPermission only please and\n\n640\n00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,830\nwe got documentation I just told you\ndon't do that without permission.\n\n641\n00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,050\nDon't try blaming it on me.\n\n642\n00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:38,670\n>> That's right.\n\n643\n00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:42,410\nI know with the official course or\nwhatever they make you sign disclosures\n\n644\n00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:46,440\nand stuff like that because these tools\nare powerful and we could do some damage.\n\n645\n00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,970\nbut the whole point is we\nwant to be ethical hackers,\n\n646\n00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:54,130\nwe want to be the ones that somebody\npays us to come find those flaws and\n\n647\n00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,150\npoint them out before the bad guy does.\n\n648\n00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,390\nWe're the good guys in this, and\nthat's what we're suppose to be.\n\n649\n00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,294\n>> Exactly.\nAnd there's other things that fit into\n\n650\n00:34:02,294 --> 00:34:05,562\nthat ethics part to, and\nI encourage each and\n\n651\n00:34:05,562 --> 00:34:08,751\nevery one of you to go\nto EC Council's site.\n\n652\n00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:11,769\nAnd they actually do have the ethics\ndocumented on their site.\n\n653\n00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:18,240\nYou will have to agree to that code of\nethics before you can even take the exam.\n\n654\n00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,360\nAnd if you break the code of ethics,\nthey can pull your credential and\n\n655\n00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,990\nyou don't want that.\n\n656\n00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,140\nAnd realistically,\nthere's stuff that's easy to follow.\n\n657\n00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:32,240\nIf you're a person\n\n658\n00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,450\nthat is an upstanding citizen,\nor whatever you want to call it,\n\n659\n00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,640\nand does the right thing, it's not\ngoing to be a hard thing to follow.\n\n660\n00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,880\nSome stuff is obvious.\n\n661\n00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,430\nDon't do stuff without permission.\n\n662\n00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:47,800\nOther ones that are in\nthere are the fact that\n\n663\n00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:53,350\nif you go into a company's network and\n\n664\n00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:58,110\nyou start finding things, the only person\nthat ever knows about it is your client.\n\n665\n00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:01,510\nYou don't go start broadcasting\nit to other people.\n\n666\n00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,543\n>> Look what I found over at this company,\nXYZ.\n\n667\n00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:04,043\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Look at these guys.\n\n668\n00:35:04,043 --> 00:35:05,265\nYeah.\n\n669\n00:35:05,265 --> 00:35:05,773\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n670\n00:35:05,773 --> 00:35:08,840\n>> Because they're entrusting you to test\n\n671\n00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,820\ntheir network.\n\n672\n00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,920\nThey have to trust that you're not gonna\nturn around and take that information that\n\n673\n00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,710\nyou were able to get access to because of\nthe vulnerability or something you found.\n\n674\n00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,440\nTurn around and\ntake that to another company and\n\n675\n00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,820\ntry to make money off of it that way or\nsomething like that.\n\n676\n00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,030\nThe trust goes out the window and at that\npoint you're not being very ethical.\n\n677\n00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:29,120\n>> Yes, and you mentioned the trust part.\n\n678\n00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,170\nThat is something that is a very important\nto throw in this too, if you get\n\n679\n00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:38,020\na reputation as not being trustworthy\nyou won't be doing this for too long.\n\n680\n00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,690\nYou really won't.\n\n681\n00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:45,890\nSo, you really want to maintain that\nhigh level of integrity in what you do.\n\n682\n00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,840\nGet permission.\n\n683\n00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,540\nDon't do stuff without it.\n\n684\n00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,860\nDo stuff under contract.\n\n685\n00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,120\nKeep stuff confidential.\n\n686\n00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,679\nMake recommendations that are realistic.\n\n687\n00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,290\nDo all these things and\nyou should have a good long career,\n\n688\n00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:04,030\nand rewarding career as a pen tester.\n\n689\n00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,460\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n690\n00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,930\nSo what are some other things that\nmotivate a corporation to really bring in\n\n691\n00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,790\na ethical hacker?\n\n692\n00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:15,700\n>> All we have to do is kind of\nscan the headlines to find out why\n\n693\n00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,655\nto answer that question.\n\n694\n00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:17,185\n>> [LAUGH] Really?\n\n695\n00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:21,522\n>> You look at people like Target,\nHome Depot, Blue Shield,\n\n696\n00:36:21,522 --> 00:36:25,696\nthere's plenty of them, and\nthat's a very short list.\n\n697\n00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:28,366\nAnd so\nmany that we could add to that list.\n\n698\n00:36:28,366 --> 00:36:29,313\nYou know multiple times right?\n\n699\n00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:30,639\n>> These are just the ones\nthat we hear of and\n\n700\n00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,085\nthat actually make\nthe big time news right?\n\n701\n00:36:32,085 --> 00:36:35,003\n>> You're making a very good\npoint there too is that for\n\n702\n00:36:35,003 --> 00:36:39,067\nevery one you hear about there's\nseveral more that never get reported.\n\n703\n00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:42,025\nAnd so companies are finding out more and\n\n704\n00:36:42,025 --> 00:36:45,853\nmore that they need to have\nthis knowledge on staff.\n\n705\n00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,540\nThis is a critical skill to have.\n\n706\n00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,790\nYou have your IT people\nduring their thing.\n\n707\n00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,850\nBut then you also have\nyour security people too.\n\n708\n00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,680\nNow sometimes they don't have\nthe budget to have both.\n\n709\n00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,330\nAll right?\n>> Right.\n\n710\n00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,180\n>> And we understand that.\n\n711\n00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,050\nThey have to train their IT\npeople to do this as well.\n\n712\n00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,220\nThat's just the reality.\n\n713\n00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,410\nBut companies are realizing that they\neither have to have those skills on staff,\n\n714\n00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:12,610\nor they need the contract externally\nto have someone assess their systems.\n\n715\n00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,820\nIf they don't, there's a lot of\nthings bad that could happen.\n\n716\n00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,719\nYeah they could be the things where\nthey become a headline themselves,\n\n717\n00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,195\nthey could be could be that target,\ncould be that Blue Shield\n\n718\n00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,695\n>> We don't want to be the next target.\n\n719\n00:37:22,695 --> 00:37:24,555\n>> Yeah you don't want to be that yeah.\n\n720\n00:37:24,555 --> 00:37:27,130\n>> You could use that either way,\nTarget or just a target.\n\n721\n00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,827\n>> Yeah exactly good point.\n\n722\n00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:31,065\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah you don't want to be that company,\n\n723\n00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:36,890\nyou want to be the company\nthat stays out of the news,\n\n724\n00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,890\nbecause your security is good.\n\n725\n00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,560\nThat's the way you want to be.\n\n726\n00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,930\nIf you start taking security lightly,\ndon't have these skills.\n\n727\n00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,770\nSomething bad is going to happen.\n\n728\n00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:53,360\nIt could be that you get hacked,\nit could also be that you\n\n729\n00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,640\ncould be into something like,\nlet's just use healthcare.\n\n730\n00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,400\nHealthcare has that HIPPA requirement.\n\n731\n00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,210\nAnd HIPAA is a world into itself.\n\n732\n00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,740\nIt really is.\n\n733\n00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,990\nWe can not teach you HIPAA\nother than saying it's for\n\n734\n00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:10,370\nhealthcare that's about as far\nas it goes here in this course.\n\n735\n00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,380\nBut there's whole things get trained and\n\n736\n00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:17,030\ncredentialed on that because it's\nsuch a complex body of knowledge.\n\n737\n00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,160\nBut HIPAA compliance it does deal\nwith technology in some areas.\n\n738\n00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:28,170\nAnd so companies that deal with that do\nhave to hire, or at least have on staff,\n\n739\n00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:31,980\npeople that know how to do the things\nthat we're going to teach you.\n\n740\n00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,080\nBecause they need to be able to see where\nthey are vulnerable and how to fix that.\n\n741\n00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,580\nAnd they need to report even if\nthey don't have to fix anything.\n\n742\n00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,410\nThey do have to present a report\nto someone, saying that yes,\n\n743\n00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:49,030\nwe did have an audit done,\nand these are the results.\n\n744\n00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,560\nIt's required in a lot of cases.\n\n745\n00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,880\nSo, and\nyou see that in many different fields now.\n\n746\n00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,210\nThe military does it, and\nit's not just the US Military,\n\n747\n00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,820\nseveral militaries around\nthe world do that as well.\n\n748\n00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,193\nThey have regular audits that\nare done to check things,\n\n749\n00:39:05,193 --> 00:39:07,524\nto make sure that there's\nnot any loopholes in there.\n\n750\n00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:11,142\n>> So really as an ethical hacker we\nhave to be familiar with all of those\n\n751\n00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:13,998\nindustry regulations and\ngovernment regulations so\n\n752\n00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:18,450\nthat we can provide accurate results and\nunderstand what that company needs to do.\n\n753\n00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,861\nAnd how they need to stay in compliance.\n\n754\n00:39:19,861 --> 00:39:23,461\nIf we don't understand it ourselves we\ncan't very well test it to make sure that\n\n755\n00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,450\nthey are in compliance.\n\n756\n00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,050\n>> Yes.\nAnd\n\n757\n00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,800\nthis is something that can\nbe kinda sticky situation.\n\n758\n00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,704\nThis is a great thing to kind\nof to know is that, yes,\n\n759\n00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,215\nyou do need to know\nabout legal regulations.\n\n760\n00:39:35,215 --> 00:39:40,074\nHowever, we can't turn you into a lawyer\nand by doing this, we just can't.\n\n761\n00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:44,757\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What I like to say is that you need to\n\n762\n00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:49,754\nknow enough about the legal regulations to\n\n763\n00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:54,355\nknow when you've stepped in it [LAUGH].\n\n764\n00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:56,216\n>> I like that.\n>> You need to recognize,\n\n765\n00:39:56,216 --> 00:40:01,660\nI'm doing that audit on a company that\ndoes healthcare, well You know enough\n\n766\n00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:07,021\nabout HIPAA to know it applies to\nhealthcare and the stuff that you're doing\n\n767\n00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:12,665\nmight require that you have someone that's\nan expert on HIPAA to work with you.\n\n768\n00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:13,930\n>> Mm, very good.\n\n769\n00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:18,390\n>> Okay, so don't look to become,\nunless you work in one of\n\n770\n00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,490\nthese areas, if you do work for\na healthcare company.\n\n771\n00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:23,750\nIf you work for a finance company.\n\n772\n00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,660\nIf you work for defense.\n\n773\n00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,140\nIf you work for any of those industries,\nthen hey by all means go ahead and\n\n774\n00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,010\nyou know those things better than most.\n\n775\n00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,330\nI've run in to people\nthat are HIPAA compliant.\n\n776\n00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,055\nThey know it backwards and forwards.\n\n777\n00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:36,650\n>> Right.\n\n778\n00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,170\n>> And they're becoming pen testers.\n\n779\n00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,320\nBut then again, they work for\na healthcare company.\n\n780\n00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,960\nSo, they've got more knowledge\nthan the average Joe would have.\n\n781\n00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,070\nI don't have HIPAA knowledge but I know\nwhen I've stepped into that area and\n\n782\n00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:51,810\nI need to get an expert\nto help me out on it.\n\n783\n00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,390\n>> Bring somebody else in\nthat can help you with that.\n\n784\n00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,220\n>> That's absolutely what\nyou want to be aware of.\n\n785\n00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:01,940\nI would focus on your pen testing skills,\nyour technical skills and\n\n786\n00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,760\nyour skills as doing what we\nhave here in this course.\n\n787\n00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,930\nAnd just know enough about\nthose various areas so\n\n788\n00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,930\nyou can recognize when\nyou've touched on them.\n\n789\n00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,630\nWhat we don't want to\nhave is you just saying,\n\n790\n00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:16,980\noh I'm in a healthcare company, just any\nother company and start working away.\n\n791\n00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,710\nThat's gonna turn out bad for you.\n\n792\n00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:20,810\nIt's just not gonna be a good thing.\n\n793\n00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,380\n>> [LAUGH] Very good, very good.\n\n794\n00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,590\nLet's see what else we can go over here.\n\n795\n00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:30,930\nWith legal regulations, we have to be\nconcerned with that as an ethical hacker.\n\n796\n00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,810\n>> Absolutely.\n\n797\n00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,880\nAbsolutely.\n\n798\n00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,840\nLegal regulations, and\nthey come into play in all sorts of areas.\n\n799\n00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,590\nYes, there's things\nlike we just mentioned,\n\n800\n00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,240\nHIPAA, and\nthere's stuff on the finance side.\n\n801\n00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,320\nThere's bunches of them\nout there that require it.\n\n802\n00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,570\nThere's even the PCI issue payment card\nindustry, has their own regulations for\n\n803\n00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:55,700\nand that's something we're gonna talk\nabout more when we get deeper into this.\n\n804\n00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,790\nBut they even have their own standards.\n\n805\n00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:03,360\nBut the legal regulations you\nrun into in addition to those,\n\n806\n00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,220\nthere's ones that say, well, you need to\nbe careful of what you're tapping into.\n\n807\n00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,140\nYou wanna be careful.\n\n808\n00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,400\nWhen you get permission, be aware of\nsystems that you could be breaking into.\n\n809\n00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,220\nThe systems,\n\n810\n00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,360\nin some cases, one of the ones that's\ncoming up now a lot in today's world.\n\n811\n00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:27,130\nIs companies that want you do a pen test,\nand they want you to test their\n\n812\n00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:32,960\napplications and their environment, and\nthey've got cloud technologies in there.\n\n813\n00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,800\nAnd they're saying, oh yeah,\nyou go test the cloud stuff, no problem.\n\n814\n00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,683\nWell you don't own the cloud stuff.\n\n815\n00:42:38,683 --> 00:42:39,436\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n816\n00:42:39,436 --> 00:42:43,697\n>> And that's gonna be a big legal issue\nif you start busting into that ISP stuff\n\n817\n00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:45,840\nand start you know monkeying around.\n\n818\n00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They are gonna have it out with you.\n\n819\n00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,290\nSo, if you find that that solution\nis part of their environment,\n\n820\n00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,100\nyou understand that legally\nyou just can't do that.\n\n821\n00:42:55,100 --> 00:43:00,000\nYou have to ask that ISP if it's okay,\nand the ISP is more likely gonna say,\n\n822\n00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,485\nwell, there's gonna be limits here.\n\n823\n00:43:01,485 --> 00:43:02,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n824\n00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,970\n>> Because if you understand the cloud,\n\n825\n00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:08,920\nyou may not be the only person\nbeing hosted in that environment.\n\n826\n00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,635\nISP wants you but it just and one example\ndo they want you poking around in there.\n\n827\n00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:17,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because if you break something and\n\n828\n00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,470\nkeep in mind, just we said that\nethical hackers use the same tools\n\n829\n00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,846\nthat the bad guys do we just\nhave the ethics part of it.\n\n830\n00:43:24,846 --> 00:43:25,497\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n831\n00:43:25,497 --> 00:43:27,840\n>> That doesn't anyway shape or\n\n832\n00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,580\nform mean that it's not gonna go\nthrough and take down a system.\n\n833\n00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,610\nYou could very easily use the exact same\ntools, take down a system, destroy things.\n\n834\n00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,530\nAnd so and\nISP that's hosting other people's stuff\n\n835\n00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:44,810\ndoesn't want your pen test for your\nclient taking down all this other stuff.\n\n836\n00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,230\nThat's gonna be very bad for\nthem, they're gonna get sued and\n\n837\n00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:50,070\nhave a bunch of stuff happening.\n\n838\n00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,857\nAnd then they're gonna turn right around\nand go after you when you do that.\n\n839\n00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:57,000\n>> Absolutely.\n>> So you need to be aware of that type of\n\n840\n00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,670\nsituation nowadays.\n\n841\n00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,020\n>> So really, when we look at being\nan ethical hacker we define it as getting\n\n842\n00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,600\npermissions.\n\n843\n00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,392\nWe gotta make sure we're getting\npermissions from the right people,\n\n844\n00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,330\nall right?\n\n845\n00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:10,550\nBecause as he's saying we might be going\nout where they've outsourced things, and\n\n846\n00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,090\nwhile they think if it as their stuff,\nthose aren't their servers.\n\n847\n00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,310\nThey're not responsible for them.\n\n848\n00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,260\nThey don't have permission,\n\n849\n00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:20,010\nthey don't have the rights to give you\npermissions to hack on that system.\n\n850\n00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:23,350\nSo when we get permissions, make sure\nyou're getting it from the right ones and\n\n851\n00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:25,990\nI've had friends tell me that, oh yeah,\n\n852\n00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,920\nJoe Schmo in IT said he wanted\nme to test this from home.\n\n853\n00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,670\nHe said, hey try to hit my server but\nhe didn't have permission, right?\n\n854\n00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,110\nHe's not the owner of that company,\nthat's not his network and\n\n855\n00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,680\nwhile he wasn't thinking about\nsome of the repercussions of it\n\n856\n00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,420\ncould affect the rest of the network.\n\n857\n00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,860\nAnd then when you talk about the cloud,\nand\n\n858\n00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,720\nall of a sudden we're bringing\nin multi-tenant scenarios.\n\n859\n00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,400\nThat opens up a whole\nanother can of worms.\n\n860\n00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,660\nThink about that.\n\n861\n00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,650\n>> It's a big problem.\n\n862\n00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,615\nYou're seeing and just to kind of bring\nsomething else into this whole thing,\n\n863\n00:44:54,615 --> 00:45:01,075\nto make you think about it is the rise\nof these smartphones and tablets.\n\n864\n00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:05,795\nThat has increasingly put pressure on\nIT departments and security departments\n\n865\n00:45:05,795 --> 00:45:08,515\non how they're gonna deal with\nthose devices in their environment.\n\n866\n00:45:08,515 --> 00:45:11,300\nThe BYOD,\nbring your own device situations.\n\n867\n00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,040\nAs well.\n\n868\n00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:14,210\nThose are all problems.\n\n869\n00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:17,370\nWhat do you do,\njust talking about smartphones,\n\n870\n00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:20,840\nwhat do you do if someone decides\nthey're gonna bring that smartphone in,\n\n871\n00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,030\nconnect it to your network, and\nretrieve email off of that?\n\n872\n00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:30,200\nWhat do you do if you decide\nto start wiping devices?\n\n873\n00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,220\nThey've had companies, this is not\nsomething just pulled out of thin air.\n\n874\n00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,920\nThis has actually happened\nwhere companies have had to\n\n875\n00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,770\nwipe devices that were\nattached to their network.\n\n876\n00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:43,840\nAnd they had people flip out saying you\nwiped my phone and we all know nowadays,\n\n877\n00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:46,577\na lot of people keep their whole\nlives on their smartphone.\n\n878\n00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,190\n>> Mm-hm.\nI couldn't imagine.\n\n879\n00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:51,600\n>> So they basically get blanked and\nthey're like, you can't do that.\n\n880\n00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,790\nAnd so what companies have had\nto start dealing with that and\n\n881\n00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:57,870\none of the ways to deal with that\nsituation is they put a legal document\n\n882\n00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,215\ntogether saying hey, if your stuff\ntouches our stuff, we can do this.\n\n883\n00:46:02,215 --> 00:46:04,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so they warn them right up front.\n\n884\n00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,930\nSo you're being told,\n\n885\n00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:10,570\nyou're incurring this amount of risk\nif you attach your stuff to ours.\n\n886\n00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:11,320\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n887\n00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,080\nThat is something that we're\nhaving to deal with more and more.\n\n888\n00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,890\nAnd we talked about, I know Microsoft\nis rolling out something called\n\n889\n00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,356\nWorkplace Join and Work Folders, and\nthat's one of the things that they deal\n\n890\n00:46:20,356 --> 00:46:22,990\nwith, is you've got these devices\nthat are not part of my domain,\n\n891\n00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,760\nnot part of my company, but\nit has company information.\n\n892\n00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,275\nSo if I go to wipe that device, can I\nwipe just the corporate data off there?\n\n893\n00:46:30,275 --> 00:46:32,795\nAnd that's something I think\nsome of these different servers\n\n894\n00:46:32,795 --> 00:46:35,775\nhaving try to figure out is how\ndo we flag that information so\n\n895\n00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,515\nthat I don't wipe out their\npictures of their grandkids.\n\n896\n00:46:38,515 --> 00:46:42,275\nBecause that's company information that on\nthose and you leave them in the back of\n\n897\n00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:44,485\nthe cab, or laying at Starbucks and-\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n898\n00:46:44,485 --> 00:46:46,815\n>> We're exposing our company data.\n\n899\n00:46:46,815 --> 00:46:48,055\n>> Yeah.\n\n900\n00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,440\nIt's a huge risk now a days.\n\n901\n00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,295\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n902\n00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:51,782\nAbsolutely.\n\n903\n00:46:51,782 --> 00:46:56,360\nAll right, so we've talked about some\nlegal regulations and some compliance.\n\n904\n00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:02,010\nWanna talk about any other corporate\nmotivations we can convince these people\n\n905\n00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:05,286\nto pay us and come in and\ndo some pen tests on there?\n\n906\n00:47:05,286 --> 00:47:08,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We talked about, really I don't know.\n\n907\n00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:12,760\nIt kinds of reminds me of the old,\nwhat is it, the art of war.\n\n908\n00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,560\nThe old Sun Tzu thing,\nknow your enemy, right?\n\n909\n00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,960\nAnd that's really, I think, what this\ncourse kinda tends to do is it teaches us,\n\n910\n00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,100\nas you were saying earlier,\nwhat it is that the bad guys are doing so\n\n911\n00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,470\nthat we understand\nthe techniques they're using.\n\n912\n00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,710\nAnd we can protect ourselves,\nwe can find it before they do.\n\n913\n00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:34,060\n>> Yeah, and I think this is a good time\nto add in something that I always like to\n\n914\n00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,260\ntell students when they\ncome to a course like this.\n\n915\n00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:41,480\nIs, you know the technical\nstuff in a course like this,\n\n916\n00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,260\nit's actually quite simple, and I know\nyeah I'm certified, and I can say that.\n\n917\n00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,903\nI can go, oh the test is easy,\nwhat are you guys talking about?\n\n918\n00:47:48,903 --> 00:47:50,075\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know I can say that.\n\n919\n00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,045\n>> Can you take the test for me?\n\n920\n00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:53,443\nYeah, it's like the test,\n[SOUND] whatever.\n\n921\n00:47:53,443 --> 00:47:55,292\nGet out of my face, it's easy.\n\n922\n00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:58,482\nI can say that but to be realistic here,\n\n923\n00:47:58,482 --> 00:48:02,750\nthe technical stuff is\nthe easy part of this course.\n\n924\n00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:08,107\nAnybody in here, okay, that's sitting\nhere watching this, and practicing,\n\n925\n00:48:08,107 --> 00:48:12,540\ncan learn the technical skills,\nyou just gotta put in the effort.\n\n926\n00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:19,870\nThe tough part is being able to think\nin different, new, and unique ways.\n\n927\n00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:22,150\nAnd you just mentioned Sun Tzu's book,\nyes,\n\n928\n00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:27,000\nI've read that myself, and that's\na different way of thinking that actually\n\n929\n00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,860\ncan be applied to what we do here,\nvery nicely, in fact.\n\n930\n00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:36,845\nSo, you've got to teach yourself new,\ndynamic, and new unique ways of thinking,\n\n931\n00:48:36,845 --> 00:48:42,750\nbecause those will help you figure\nnew ways to apply these technologies.\n\n932\n00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:45,951\nI look at these skills and\ntechnologies that we learn here,\n\n933\n00:48:45,951 --> 00:48:49,471\nI look at them kind of like,\nI liked playing with Lego's as a kid,\n\n934\n00:48:49,471 --> 00:48:53,631\njust like each one of them is like a block\nyou put together to make whatever your\n\n935\n00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:56,147\nsolution is, and that's what we're doing.\n\n936\n00:48:56,147 --> 00:49:00,470\nSo, you have to learn, okay,\nonce I've learned what all these building\n\n937\n00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:05,001\nblocks are, how can I put these things\ntogether to get a successful audit, or\n\n938\n00:49:05,001 --> 00:49:07,187\nget the right results for this test.\n\n939\n00:49:07,187 --> 00:49:08,150\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n940\n00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,463\nI like that.\n\n941\n00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:12,379\nAll right, ladies and\ngentlemen, I'll tell you what,\n\n942\n00:49:12,379 --> 00:49:15,537\nthat is probably a good breaking point for\nus, so stay tuned,\n\n943\n00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:19,342\nwhen we come back we're gonna get into\nwho an ethical hacker actually is.\n\n944\n00:49:19,342 --> 00:49:21,583\nSo stay tuned,\nwe'll be back in just a few.\n\n945\n00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:28,629\n[MUSIC]\n\n946\n00:49:28,629 --> 00:49:31,323\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n947\n00:49:31,323 --> 00:49:35,010\nWe are getting ready to talk about\nwhat makes an ethical hacker.\n\n948\n00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:36,070\nSo, Sean, what is it?\n\n949\n00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:37,300\nWhat rates as an ethical hacker?\n\n950\n00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,042\nWho is this ethical hacker we speak of?\n\n951\n00:49:40,042 --> 00:49:41,319\n>> Right here.\n\n952\n00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:45,167\n[LAUGH]\n>> An ethical hacker,\n\n953\n00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:50,705\nthat is something that we do have to\nkind of get into the explanation for.\n\n954\n00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:55,105\nBecause there is some question on\nwhat makes someone an ethical hacker.\n\n955\n00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:58,805\nNow, we've already described what\nan ethical hacker is supposed to be doing.\n\n956\n00:49:58,805 --> 00:50:01,965\n>> We talked about ethics,\nhaving permission, and things like that.\n\n957\n00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:03,260\n>> Exactly, yeah.\n\n958\n00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:07,000\nSo, we gotta start talking about\nwhat your actual makeup is.\n\n959\n00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,463\nIf you were gonna be an ethical hacker,\nwell,\n\n960\n00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:12,572\nwhat skills that you really\nneed to have to be successful.\n\n961\n00:50:12,572 --> 00:50:13,223\n>> Okay.\n>> And\n\n962\n00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:15,566\nthat's what makes the difference here.\n\n963\n00:50:15,566 --> 00:50:17,412\nSo, when we talk about required skills,\n\n964\n00:50:17,412 --> 00:50:19,908\nthey tend to come in the areas\nof technical, personal.\n\n965\n00:50:19,908 --> 00:50:23,570\nAnd then there's a group of skills\nI like to call your intangibles.\n\n966\n00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:28,770\nMost of the time when people look\nat the skills of an ethical hacker,\n\n967\n00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:32,150\nthey do tend to think of just one, which\nis the most obvious one, the technical.\n\n968\n00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:32,911\n>> The skills, yeah.\n\n969\n00:50:32,911 --> 00:50:35,234\nI mean, when I think of skills\nI think of the ability to, oh,\n\n970\n00:50:35,234 --> 00:50:38,245\nyou can break into any machine, you can\nget access to any resource you want to,\n\n971\n00:50:38,245 --> 00:50:39,510\nthat kind of thing, right?\n\n972\n00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:41,090\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n973\n00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,650\nSo, those become the,\nthat's the obvious one.\n\n974\n00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:47,220\nSo, let's just talk about that one first,\nokay?\n\n975\n00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:47,940\n>> All right.\n\n976\n00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:50,270\n>> We'll talk about what\nthe technical skills are.\n\n977\n00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:55,142\nWell, technical skills are competencies\nthat an ethical hacker needs to or\n\n978\n00:50:55,142 --> 00:50:56,160\nshould possess.\n\n979\n00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,700\nThe basic things you need to have\nis you need to have really good\n\n980\n00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:04,470\nplatform knowledge, meaning operating\nsystems, you need to understand those.\n\n981\n00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:09,150\nNow, I'm gonna be the last person to\ntell you that you need to go through and\n\n982\n00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,990\nunderstand every operating\nsystem out there.\n\n983\n00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,430\nYou're just, you're not gonna do it.\n\n984\n00:51:12,430 --> 00:51:15,220\nYou can understand how to use it, but\n\n985\n00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:18,190\nknowing the technical details of each,\nthat's a big task.\n\n986\n00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:19,420\nYou could do it.\n\n987\n00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,738\nIt's a doable task, but I don't think it's\nsomething that you should really attempt.\n\n988\n00:51:23,738 --> 00:51:28,450\nWhat you should look at is, if you look\nat, if you're gonna do a remote pen\n\n989\n00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:33,560\ntesting, Windows and a good understanding\nof Linux are probably all you need.\n\n990\n00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,390\n>> Okay.\n\n991\n00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,960\n>> Because most environments run Windows,\nand\n\n992\n00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,785\nthen there's a lot of good\nsecurity tools on Linux.\n\n993\n00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:42,792\n>> Yeah, that's what you tend to see out\nthere in the corporate world, right?\n\n994\n00:51:42,792 --> 00:51:43,950\nWindows is the predominant.\n\n995\n00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:47,243\nI think the last time I checked it was\na little over 90% of the machines out\n\n996\n00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:50,230\nthere were gonna be running\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n997\n00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,795\nAnd then as you say, a lot of the cool\ntools, the stuff that I need to perform\n\n998\n00:51:53,795 --> 00:51:57,350\nthese type of penetration\ntesting are all Linux based.\n\n999\n00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:00,740\nWe might get a Windows port for a few of\nthem here and there, and they might or\n\n1000\n00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:02,150\nmight not work as well as the original.\n\n1001\n00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:04,340\n>> That's very much true.\n\n1002\n00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:08,930\nWindows, while it does have some\nports of the tools that are on Linux,\n\n1003\n00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,450\nthey just seem to be\nlimited in a lot of cases.\n\n1004\n00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,490\nSo, if you really wanna\nget the most bang for\n\n1005\n00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:16,370\nyour buck,\nyou really kinda gotta know Linux.\n\n1006\n00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:20,190\nSo that's something that has\nto be on your to-do list.\n\n1007\n00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:22,000\n>> Not to mention it's free,\nso it's easy to obtain, right?\n\n1008\n00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:22,707\n>> Exactly.\n\n1009\n00:52:22,707 --> 00:52:25,632\nCan't beat that, right?\n\n1010\n00:52:25,632 --> 00:52:28,523\n>> [LAUGH] Any particular flavors\nof Linux you really like?\n\n1011\n00:52:28,523 --> 00:52:32,351\n>> Probably the most important one\nthat you need to learn is Kali Linux,\n\n1012\n00:52:32,351 --> 00:52:35,001\nwhich is a specific pen\ntesting distribution.\n\n1013\n00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:37,310\n>> And that was formerly known as\nBacktracks, if I remember correctly.\n\n1014\n00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:38,640\n>> Exactly.\n\n1015\n00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,810\n>> And it's great because I'm not\na Linux guru, I mean I can dabble in it.\n\n1016\n00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,840\nBut I'm not good at compiling things,\nand things like that.\n\n1017\n00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:47,540\nMan, you fire up Kali, and\nit's got everything in there.\n\n1018\n00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:48,340\nEverything you need.\n\n1019\n00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:49,410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1020\n00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:54,340\nIn fact, what they did is, Backtrack\nevolved into Kali because when they\n\n1021\n00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:59,915\nre-architected the product they decided\nto really tightly integrate the tools.\n\n1022\n00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:02,992\nInstead of just installing them in there,\nthey decided we're gonna integrate them\n\n1023\n00:53:02,992 --> 00:53:04,698\nmuch more tightly with\nthe operating system.\n\n1024\n00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,240\nSo they're even more powerful\nthan they were before.\n\n1025\n00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,770\n>> Got you.\n>> And so it's a really great tool to have\n\n1026\n00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,480\naccess to.\n\n1027\n00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,570\nAnd it's something that you\njust need to have nowadays.\n\n1028\n00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,430\nYou just kind of need to learn that.\n\n1029\n00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:19,110\nAnd like you're saying, it's free,\nso you can't beat that.\n\n1030\n00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:24,180\nIt's very well documented, so\nyou really should put that on your list.\n\n1031\n00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,500\nNow, if you happen to be in an environment\nthat's not using Windows, or\n\n1032\n00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:33,590\nit's using the Mac OS, or UNIX, then of\ncourse, you're gonna need to learn those.\n\n1033\n00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:37,970\nBut most people are gonna do Windows,\nand they're gonna do Linux for\n\n1034\n00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:41,940\npen testing, and that's probably\ngoing to be all they need to get.\n\n1035\n00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,470\nBut you should at least\nunderstand the other ones.\n\n1036\n00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:47,060\nIf you don't have in-depth\nknowledge of them, that's fine.\n\n1037\n00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,087\nYou know how to use the internet, right?\n\n1038\n00:53:50,087 --> 00:53:50,759\n>> Right.\n\n1039\n00:53:50,759 --> 00:53:54,578\n[LAUGH] There's a couple good\nsearch engines out there, maybe-\n\n1040\n00:53:54,578 --> 00:53:57,133\n>> Yeah, there's a few.\n\n1041\n00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,900\nOther technical skills you\nshould have is networking.\n\n1042\n00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,750\nYou should really have a good\nunderstanding of networking.\n\n1043\n00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:07,580\nYou should understand the TCP/IP protocol,\nboth IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n1044\n00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:13,238\nNot only is EC-Council testing on\nknowledge of those, in the whole TCP/IP\n\n1045\n00:54:13,238 --> 00:54:18,440\nsuite, they are starting to test on IPv6,\nand it's starting to show up.\n\n1046\n00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,670\nAnd the reality of the matter\nis that TCP/IP 6, or IPv6,\n\n1047\n00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:26,910\nis actually showing up in\na lot more environments,\n\n1048\n00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:29,910\neven though it really hasn't made\nits big formal entrance yet.\n\n1049\n00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,950\nIt's gradually showing up, and\nin some corners of the world,\n\n1050\n00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:37,910\nit's actually used a lot\nmore than it is here.\n\n1051\n00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:41,030\n>> In fact, most of your Windows machines,\nunless you specifically disable it,\n\n1052\n00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,930\nthey're gonna be running it.\n\n1053\n00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,990\nIn fact, they prefer it when they're\ncommunicating with each other on a subnet\n\n1054\n00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:45,780\nand things like that.\n\n1055\n00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,150\nSo, it's out there, and if we're not\nunfamiliar with the vulnerabilities and\n\n1056\n00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:50,090\nthe things that go along with it,\n\n1057\n00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,060\nthat could be an easy backdoor\nthat we forget about.\n\n1058\n00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:53,880\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1059\n00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,790\nSo you need to start understanding that,\n\n1060\n00:54:56,790 --> 00:55:00,480\nstart really getting into it if\nyou're not already using it.\n\n1061\n00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,260\nSo I would strongly,\nstrongly recommend that.\n\n1062\n00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,677\nOther technical skills to\nkinda move on with that,\n\n1063\n00:55:07,677 --> 00:55:10,783\nyou should understand networking hardware.\n\n1064\n00:55:10,783 --> 00:55:17,946\nIf you understand how to use routers, and\nswitches, and what those do, that's great.\n\n1065\n00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:23,425\nYou need to really understand those,\nbecause as you'll see in later lessons,\n\n1066\n00:55:23,425 --> 00:55:26,570\nwe will talk about sniffing, for example.\n\n1067\n00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:30,780\nAnd sniffing, you're gonna run into\nswitches, it's just the nature of\n\n1068\n00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,320\nthe beast, and if a switch is in the way,\nand you don't understand\n\n1069\n00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,210\nhow to manipulate it, that's gonna put a\nsevere damper on your sniffing abilities.\n\n1070\n00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,410\nSo you really need to understand that.\n\n1071\n00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,297\nYou also need to understand firewalls and\n\n1072\n00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:48,840\nall that other good stuff to really\nbe able to do pen testing well.\n\n1073\n00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,008\n>> And I know in your book, you do cover\nthose different networking devices, but\n\n1074\n00:55:52,008 --> 00:55:54,708\nas you're saying, you really have\nto have a good knowledge of it.\n\n1075\n00:55:54,708 --> 00:55:57,907\nSo if you guys are newer to this stuff and\nyou don't have that experience,\n\n1076\n00:55:57,907 --> 00:56:00,952\nyou can always go back and\ncheck out other episodes, like Network+,\n\n1077\n00:56:00,952 --> 00:56:04,278\nwhere we go over a lot of those devices,\nand I think A+ and things like that.\n\n1078\n00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:07,167\n>> Yeah, and I would very strongly\nrecommend that, as a matter of fact.\n\n1079\n00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,667\nIt's a very good point to bring up.\n\n1080\n00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:13,387\nIf you are, it's a kind of measure,\nyou should really look at these skills I'm\n\n1081\n00:56:13,387 --> 00:56:18,040\ntalking about as also a measure of\nwhere you are coming into this course.\n\n1082\n00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,172\nIf you don't have good\nnetworking knowledge or\n\n1083\n00:56:21,172 --> 00:56:26,180\nyou're just a little kind of maybe need\nto have some of the rust knocked off,\n\n1084\n00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:29,410\nthen by all means, go and\nlook at a network plus.\n\n1085\n00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:33,650\nIt would be a good place\nto start in a review.\n\n1086\n00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:36,180\nAn A+ is good as well.\n\n1087\n00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,340\nJust need to have that knowledge\nto really be successful.\n\n1088\n00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:43,580\nCan you do this course\nwithout that knowledge?\n\n1089\n00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:47,070\nI suppose you can if you really wanted to.\n\n1090\n00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:53,620\nBut it's gonna severely limit your ability\nto understand everything that's happening.\n\n1091\n00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,900\nAs well as even if you get\nsuccess through the course and\n\n1092\n00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,750\nget the credential,\nnot having that knowledge\n\n1093\n00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,390\nis severely gonna limit your ability\nto do an effective pen test.\n\n1094\n00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:04,480\nAnd that's just not good.\n\n1095\n00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:06,550\nThat's gonna put you out\nof work really quick.\n\n1096\n00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:10,660\n>> You walk in and they've hired you to do\nthis penetration test on their network and\n\n1097\n00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,770\nyou're like wait,\nis that a hub or a switch?\n\n1098\n00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:16,260\nWhy am I not getting any packets\non my packet capture utility here?\n\n1099\n00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:19,560\n>> Exactly.\n\n1100\n00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:23,087\nSo those would be some of\nthe core technical skills,\n\n1101\n00:57:23,087 --> 00:57:26,545\nplatform knowledge networking\nwould be big ones.\n\n1102\n00:57:26,545 --> 00:57:28,368\nJust having that.\n\n1103\n00:57:28,368 --> 00:57:31,813\nIf you want to, for\nthe [INAUDIBLE] networking hardware,\n\n1104\n00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:36,635\nyou might want to consider doing\nsomething equivalent to a CCNA type deal.\n\n1105\n00:57:36,635 --> 00:57:37,695\nThat's not a bad idea.\n\n1106\n00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:40,985\nIf you do possess that.\n\n1107\n00:57:40,985 --> 00:57:41,955\nThat's only gonna help you.\n\n1108\n00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:45,195\nIt's definitely not required\nto be an ethical hacker.\n\n1109\n00:57:45,195 --> 00:57:48,730\nJust understand what the devices do and\nhow they work.\n\n1110\n00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,690\nIf you need to make recommendations on\nit then you're gonna need the CCNA or\n\n1111\n00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,350\nJuniper or\nwhatever knowledge as the case may be.\n\n1112\n00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:02,335\nOther skills to move on beyond\nthe technical skills is to talk about\n\n1113\n00:58:02,335 --> 00:58:06,570\npersonal skills,\nthat's one that is not really looked at.\n\n1114\n00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,297\n>> We're computer guys,\ndo we really have personal skills?\n\n1115\n00:58:10,297 --> 00:58:12,258\n>> Let's face it, most of you don't.\n\n1116\n00:58:12,258 --> 00:58:14,151\nYou know who you are.\n\n1117\n00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:15,730\nI see the chat room over here.\n\n1118\n00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:24,438\n[LAUGH] the thing is that the personal\nskills are just a skill that's lacking.\n\n1119\n00:58:24,438 --> 00:58:26,972\nAnd it's not like I'm telling you,\n\n1120\n00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:30,980\nyour personal skills day to\nday interacting with people,\n\n1121\n00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:36,213\nthose ones aren't the silly ones I'm\ntalking about, I am talking about how\n\n1122\n00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:41,410\nyou interact with people, but\nI'm also talking about how to read people.\n\n1123\n00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:46,930\nTalking about how to\nkind of figure out where\n\n1124\n00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:52,170\nconversations are going because those are\nthings that you use in social engineering.\n\n1125\n00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:57,190\nSo don't expect to be sitting\nthere in a pen task and\n\n1126\n00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,970\nonly be asked to technical stuff.\n\n1127\n00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:04,610\nIt's not uncommon for them to say, well,\nI need you to test how my employees\n\n1128\n00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:08,610\nadhere policy and\nhow well they understand things.\n\n1129\n00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:11,600\n>> Because that's an attack vector\nthat the bad guys are gonna use so\n\n1130\n00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:13,170\nwe need to make sure\nthat we're testing that.\n\n1131\n00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:15,410\nTesting our employees as\nwell as our equipment.\n\n1132\n00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:16,960\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1133\n00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,700\nAnd if you don't have good personal\nskills that could be a damper.\n\n1134\n00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:24,840\nThat could definitely be a damper for you.\n\n1135\n00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,626\nSo, things like if you're not\ncomfortable talking to people,\n\n1136\n00:59:28,626 --> 00:59:33,040\nthen you may wanna start\ndeveloping that a bit more and\n\n1137\n00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,560\nbeing a little more fluent in how\nyou talk and how confident you are.\n\n1138\n00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,970\nThat's definitely gonna help you.\n\n1139\n00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:42,240\n>> David and William out there in\nthe chat room mentioning, good hygiene.\n\n1140\n00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,390\nThat's always important right?\n\n1141\n00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,270\nWe wanna smell good when\nwe walk into the office.\n\n1142\n00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,280\n>> Good hygiene is always a good plus.\n\n1143\n00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,538\nSo extra points for that.\n\n1144\n00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:54,626\n[LAUGH]\nthen one more thing I kinda\n\n1145\n00:59:54,626 --> 01:00:00,710\nwanna throw into this is some tangible\nskills, what do I really mean by that?\n\n1146\n01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:03,590\nI mean the kind of stuff that's not\ncovered by a technical impersonal,\n\n1147\n01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,640\nit's not something you can\nreally quantify that easily.\n\n1148\n01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,610\nOne of the ones that I tend to\nlook at as a tangible skill\n\n1149\n01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,530\nis an attention to detail.\n\n1150\n01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:15,274\n>> You have to have\nan attention to detail.\n\n1151\n01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:21,032\nAnd it's something that I can\nhelp you during this course.\n\n1152\n01:00:21,032 --> 01:00:25,561\nKind of, draw your attention to certain\nthings, but you're gonna have to develop\n\n1153\n01:00:25,561 --> 01:00:29,765\nan eye over time to see, okay there's\na little detail there and a detail there\n\n1154\n01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:33,800\nthat I could actually weave into\na bigger picture to see what's going on.\n\n1155\n01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,470\n>> But somebody without those skills\nmight miss and not see it, or\n\n1156\n01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:38,880\nit's actually part of my solution or\npart of my problem.\n\n1157\n01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,040\n>> Exactly.\n\n1158\n01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,720\nI mean, in a sense,\nyou're kind of playing a detective.\n\n1159\n01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,760\nYou've gotta really look\nat those little clues.\n\n1160\n01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,570\nThat little thing that's out of place\nthat may not seem that significant,\n\n1161\n01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,610\nit very well could play out to\nbe a very big thing later on.\n\n1162\n01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:57,920\nSo, you really have that attention\nto detail to see what's going on.\n\n1163\n01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,430\nIf you miss a little thing, that could be\nthe one thing that could help you out.\n\n1164\n01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:05,320\nThe one thing that really, you know,\nhelps move your test forward.\n\n1165\n01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,260\nSo that would be one intangible skill.\n\n1166\n01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:13,730\nAnother one I think is an important\none is a sense of curiosity,\n\n1167\n01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:17,800\nthat would be a really big one for you.\n\n1168\n01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:21,060\nIf you don't have a sense of curiosity,\nin the sense, and\n\n1169\n01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:26,760\na drive to wanna try new things and\nto tinker around, and to experiment.\n\n1170\n01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:33,280\nThen you can still be successful in\nthis field but that would limit you too.\n\n1171\n01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:37,030\n>> This is really such\na dynamic field right.\n\n1172\n01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,990\nI mean the security industry and\nthe security side of things.\n\n1173\n01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,830\nAnd we know that just our operating\nsystems change every couple of years\n\n1174\n01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,410\nand things like that.\n\n1175\n01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:44,470\nYou get into security,\n\n1176\n01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:47,132\nand it seems like they're coming out\nwith new vulnerabilities every day,\n\n1177\n01:01:47,132 --> 01:01:50,520\nthey're patching up those vulnerabilities,\nthey're modifying their attack,\n\n1178\n01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,910\nfiguring out another way that\nthey can get around your defense.\n\n1179\n01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:56,778\nSo if you're not willing to put the time\nin to stay educated, to join forums,\n\n1180\n01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:59,218\nto join news groups to\nkeep on top of everything,\n\n1181\n01:01:59,218 --> 01:02:00,960\nyou can fall behind pretty quick.\n\n1182\n01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,276\n>> No absolutely, you gotta be willing\nto not only do your research but\n\n1183\n01:02:05,276 --> 01:02:07,560\nwilling to explore.\n\n1184\n01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,180\nIf you get a new piece of hardware,\nwhat can it really do?\n\n1185\n01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:18,106\nYou need to kinda have that curiosity and\nseek out information, to try new things,\n\n1186\n01:02:18,106 --> 01:02:23,070\nto experiment, I tell people when I'm\nteaching this in the classroom setting,\n\n1187\n01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:27,902\nfor example, is I will tell them we've\ngot virtual machines for everything.\n\n1188\n01:02:27,902 --> 01:02:28,528\n>> Right.\n\n1189\n01:02:28,528 --> 01:02:30,141\n>> Tell them, go ahead and break it.\n\n1190\n01:02:30,141 --> 01:02:34,322\nIf you haven't broken it in the class,\nthen I'm not impressed.\n\n1191\n01:02:34,322 --> 01:02:35,029\n>> That's right.\n\n1192\n01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:36,702\n>> [LAUGH] I can fix it.\n\n1193\n01:02:36,702 --> 01:02:38,803\nI can fix a virtual machine pretty easily.\n\n1194\n01:02:38,803 --> 01:02:39,408\nAbsolutely.\n>> But\n\n1195\n01:02:39,408 --> 01:02:43,728\nyou need to learn how to you know not be\nafraid that, hey something breaks it,\n\n1196\n01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:46,001\neverything's a learning experience.\n\n1197\n01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:49,379\nIf you break it, you know what\nyou did to break it, hopefully.\n\n1198\n01:02:49,379 --> 01:02:51,968\n>> And if you don't,\nyou learn how to fix it.\n\n1199\n01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:54,499\nThat's what you've gotta be able to do.\n\n1200\n01:02:54,499 --> 01:02:56,646\n>> The virtual environment\nreally changed a lot of things.\n\n1201\n01:02:56,646 --> 01:02:59,064\nIt made the ability to sit there and\nbang and things and\n\n1202\n01:02:59,064 --> 01:03:01,766\nnot worry about destroying\nyour production environment.\n\n1203\n01:03:01,766 --> 01:03:05,371\nOr, trying to mimic a complete production\nenvironment on physical hardware,\n\n1204\n01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:07,370\ncan be expensive and challenging.\n\n1205\n01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:09,440\nWith a virtual environment,\nyou really have no excuse, right?\n\n1206\n01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,580\nI mean, you can get trial versions of\nsoftware, you can set up entire networks\n\n1207\n01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:17,100\non one machine, assume you've\ngot the horsepower to run it.\n\n1208\n01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,920\nAnd like you said, you just turn off and\nturn it back on, or\n\n1209\n01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,840\nhit the, rollback to a snapshot,\nand you're good to go.\n\n1210\n01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,190\nSo, you gotta get in there and\nplay with these tools, and try things,\n\n1211\n01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:29,930\nand like you said, you know let's say our\ncompany's rolling out a new application.\n\n1212\n01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:33,733\nThe vendor's gonna tell you it's\nperfectly safe and blah, blah, blah, but\n\n1213\n01:03:33,733 --> 01:03:38,500\nas IT security guy you gotta be the one\nthat says well let's really try it out.\n\n1214\n01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,690\nLet's put this in a virtual machine and\nhammer on it.\n\n1215\n01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,110\nWith some of the techniques that\nI know as an ethical hacker and\n\n1216\n01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,820\njust see what that\napplication can withstand.\n\n1217\n01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:46,840\nReally get in there and\n\n1218\n01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,960\nplay with it, no excuse not to with\nall the virtual stuff we've got.\n\n1219\n01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:52,650\n>> That's what it's all about,\njust trying things out.\n\n1220\n01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,250\nIn fact, I just kinda add onto that\nthought a bit is I have noticed\n\n1221\n01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:04,958\nas far as training goes this isn't\nto bash formal training at all.\n\n1222\n01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:08,630\nIt's just to tell you that you do\nhave a little bit of a block or\n\n1223\n01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:10,583\na disadvantage in some senses.\n\n1224\n01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:15,172\nIf you have formal training you've\ngotta realize that you've been trained\n\n1225\n01:04:15,172 --> 01:04:19,050\nthrough courses or books or\nwhatever to do things a certain way.\n\n1226\n01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:21,920\nThat's great.\n\n1227\n01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,890\nI'm not knocking formalized\ntraining at all.\n\n1228\n01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:28,460\nBut, I would encourage you say,\njust because they've taught you\n\n1229\n01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:31,270\none way in a class,\nthat doesn't mean it's the only way.\n\n1230\n01:04:31,270 --> 01:04:34,040\nLearn how to do it the structured way,\n\n1231\n01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,370\nlearn what they want you to learn,\nand then start dissecting things and\n\n1232\n01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:41,330\nlearning how they tick,\nstart coloring outside the lines.\n\n1233\n01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:42,710\n>> I was going to say,\nnot to be cliché, but\n\n1234\n01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:46,230\nyou gotta get outside of the box\nsometimes to really see what's going on.\n\n1235\n01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,433\nYou really do.\n>> Yeah, don't be afraid,\n\n1236\n01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:51,927\nlike I said we got the technology\nnowadays to do this.\n\n1237\n01:04:51,927 --> 01:04:55,067\n>> So a lot of skills required\nas an ethical hacker.\n\n1238\n01:04:55,067 --> 01:04:58,315\nWe want the technical skills,\nthe familiarity with all the different\n\n1239\n01:04:58,315 --> 01:05:02,013\nplatforms that we might face or have to\nprotect, or that the bad guys are using.\n\n1240\n01:05:02,013 --> 01:05:06,385\nWe've got those personal skills to\nmake sure I'm at least somewhat to\n\n1241\n01:05:06,385 --> 01:05:11,140\nthe ability to communicate with people and\nto try some of those techniques.\n\n1242\n01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,680\nWe'll talk about things like social\nengineering at some point in our episodes.\n\n1243\n01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,880\nAnd then those intangibles,\n\n1244\n01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,670\nthat problem solving capabilities,\nthat curiosity and things like that.\n\n1245\n01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:24,740\nSo, a lot of things go into becoming\na good successful ethical hacker.\n\n1246\n01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:25,360\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1247\n01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,845\n>> So let's move on into into\ncyber criminals and crimes.\n\n1248\n01:05:30,845 --> 01:05:31,467\nI like that idea here.\n\n1249\n01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:32,686\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What have we got?\n\n1250\n01:05:32,686 --> 01:05:35,423\nIndeed.\n>> Well, when you're talking about\n\n1251\n01:05:35,423 --> 01:05:40,051\nan ethical hacker, you need to talk\nabout who's on the other side.\n\n1252\n01:05:40,051 --> 01:05:46,674\nAnd this also talks to a bit of\nthe need for having an ethical hacker.\n\n1253\n01:05:46,674 --> 01:05:51,140\nOne of the other reasons why,\nwe've mentioned this previously,\n\n1254\n01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:56,403\nthat we need to have ethical hackers,\nand companies have realized the need for\n\n1255\n01:05:56,403 --> 01:06:00,572\nthem or why they want them is\nbecause this rise of cyber crime.\n\n1256\n01:06:00,572 --> 01:06:04,850\n>> I mean cyber crime is not decreasing,\nit's going the other way.\n\n1257\n01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:07,671\n>> More and more businesses\nare putting all of their data and\n\n1258\n01:06:07,671 --> 01:06:08,789\neverything online and\n\n1259\n01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:13,104\neverything is so interconnected nowadays\nthat the opportunities are there, right?\n\n1260\n01:06:13,104 --> 01:06:17,345\nAnd the bad guys, of course they're\ngonna go for the low-hanging fruit,\n\n1261\n01:06:17,345 --> 01:06:21,250\nthe easy targets,\nright now it's all this cyber stuff.\n\n1262\n01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:27,750\n>> Yeah, you see all sorts of information\nbeing shared online, you're seeing more\n\n1263\n01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:32,780\nstuff being networked, you're seeing more\npowerful applications being put out there.\n\n1264\n01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,170\nAnd then you're seeing\n\n1265\n01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:38,640\npeople sharing stuff without thinking\nabout where it could be going.\n\n1266\n01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:39,500\nI mean that's just one thing.\n\n1267\n01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,290\nThen you start factoring in\nstuff like financial fraud,\n\n1268\n01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,550\nintellectual property theft.\n\n1269\n01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:48,790\nThat's a big one,\nthat companies don't want.\n\n1270\n01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:50,097\nFor their IP's to be stolen.\n\n1271\n01:06:50,097 --> 01:06:54,732\n>> And then even when you stop going on\ntop of that you have things like identity\n\n1272\n01:06:54,732 --> 01:06:58,424\ntheft which is a lot more of\na problem then people may think.\n\n1273\n01:06:58,424 --> 01:07:03,217\nNot to kinda worry anybody and\ndo a whole chicken little type thing here,\n\n1274\n01:07:03,217 --> 01:07:07,880\nbut it is a much bigger problem\nthen people tend to think.\n\n1275\n01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,908\nAnd then you have things\nlike extortion and\n\n1276\n01:07:09,908 --> 01:07:13,360\nstuff like that happening not to\nmention the big one, cyber terrorism.\n\n1277\n01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,864\nThat is a thing.\n\n1278\n01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:15,583\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1279\n01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,081\nIt's not a term they made up.\n\n1280\n01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:21,960\nThis is actually occurring and we are\nconstantly fighting that kind of thing.\n\n1281\n01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:22,560\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1282\n01:07:24,550 --> 01:07:28,510\n>> So they, with CEH they try\nto divide this up, right?\n\n1283\n01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:30,730\nThey talk about these\ndifferent hats if you will.\n\n1284\n01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,890\nSo let's talk about that,\nthe different hats or\n\n1285\n01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:38,245\nhow how me might classify hackers and\ntypes of tests.\n\n1286\n01:07:38,245 --> 01:07:44,430\n>> Yeah, I've said, so far here,\nwe've got the good guys and the bad guys.\n\n1287\n01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:45,260\nOkay?\n\n1288\n01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,490\nWe can't be that simple.\n\n1289\n01:07:46,490 --> 01:07:47,262\nYou know it's not that easy.\n\n1290\n01:07:47,262 --> 01:07:48,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're not going to get a true,\n\n1291\n01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,553\nfalse question,\nsaying good guys, bad guys.\n\n1292\n01:07:50,553 --> 01:07:52,755\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've got this, I think I'm good.\n\n1293\n01:07:52,755 --> 01:07:54,780\n>> Ethical hackers a good guy or\na bad guy?\n\n1294\n01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,500\n>> People are like hold on,\nI know this one.\n\n1295\n01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,765\n>> May I have a lifeline please?\n\n1296\n01:07:59,765 --> 01:08:03,970\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well there's obviously a little more to\n\n1297\n01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:04,730\nit than that.\n\n1298\n01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:10,860\nThe three basic types we have\nare the white hats, the black hats and\n\n1299\n01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:11,730\nthe gray hats.\n\n1300\n01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,790\nThe white hats are the good guys.\n\n1301\n01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,190\nComes from the westerns,\nwith the white hats,\n\n1302\n01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:21,200\nthe cliché, that's where it came from.\n\n1303\n01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,230\nSo the white hats are the good guys,\nthey're security researchers,\n\n1304\n01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:28,140\nthey're pen testers, the ethical\nhacking types, that what they are.\n\n1305\n01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:29,490\nThey only hack with permission.\n\n1306\n01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:34,290\nThey have equivalent knowledge to\ntheir opponents on the other side,\n\n1307\n01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:35,510\nthe black hats.\n\n1308\n01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:38,040\nThe black hats of course\nwe think about the guys\n\n1309\n01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,080\nwearing the black hats in the movies.\n\n1310\n01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,040\nThose are the bad guys.\n\n1311\n01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,875\nThese are the guys that\nare up to no good and\n\n1312\n01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:50,270\nthey're just doing stuff to cause\nmischief, maybe doing stuff for\n\n1313\n01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:55,140\na criminal purpose, but they're doing\nstuff that's just very disruptive.\n\n1314\n01:08:56,470 --> 01:09:00,264\nThen you have in-between those you have an\ninteresting one, you have the gray hats.\n\n1315\n01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:03,970\n>> The guys who are riding the fence and\ncan't decide if they want to\n\n1316\n01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:06,385\nput the white hat or\nthe black hat on, is that what it is?\n\n1317\n01:09:06,385 --> 01:09:07,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's like my ex-girlfriend\n\n1318\n01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,520\ncan't make a choice.\n\n1319\n01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,220\nSo, what you have there is,\n\n1320\n01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:17,960\na gray hat is someone they\nsay can hack offensively and\n\n1321\n01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,700\ndefensively at times, if you go\nby EC Council's definition of it.\n\n1322\n01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:25,090\nIn some circles they will say that\n\n1323\n01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:29,880\na gray hat is a black hat that's\nkinda changed their ways.\n\n1324\n01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,470\nAnd instead of calling them a white hat\nat that point, they call them a gray hat\n\n1325\n01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:38,430\nbecause if you were a black hat and\nyou've come in from the cold, we're not\n\n1326\n01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:41,950\nreally sure what your motivations\nare because you were doing this.\n\n1327\n01:09:41,950 --> 01:09:44,260\nSo, it takes time for them to trust you.\n\n1328\n01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:47,380\nSo, you're considered\na gray hat at that point.\n\n1329\n01:09:47,380 --> 01:09:49,948\n>> The pull to the dark side\nis strong young caddy Wan.\n\n1330\n01:09:49,948 --> 01:09:51,516\n>> [LAUGH] You don't know the power.\n\n1331\n01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:54,875\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n1332\n01:09:54,875 --> 01:09:59,510\nit's definitely three types now.\n\n1333\n01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:02,880\nWhat you really want to also\nstart looking at is that\n\n1334\n01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,690\nyou have different\nsubtypes underneath that.\n\n1335\n01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:07,580\nYou have things like hacktivists.\n\n1336\n01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,730\nI know are one category.\n\n1337\n01:10:09,730 --> 01:10:12,540\n>> Somebody that's hacking with\nsome kind of political agenda or\n\n1338\n01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:13,760\nsomething like that.\n\n1339\n01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,140\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1340\n01:10:15,140 --> 01:10:19,260\nIn fact,\none of the more famous ones is Anonymous.\n\n1341\n01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:23,650\nAnonymous is a great example\nof a hacktivist group is that\n\n1342\n01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:28,780\nthey are hacking for a purpose,\nto get there message across or\n\n1343\n01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:35,510\nto do something to basically have\nrevenge or something against a group.\n\n1344\n01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:42,250\nAnd they've also, it's not just revenge,\nthey have offensively hacked groups.\n\n1345\n01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:46,110\nWhat makes them kind of\ninteresting is the fact\n\n1346\n01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:52,560\npeople are kinda confused on a group like\nAnonymous, just to get as an aside here,\n\n1347\n01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,860\nbecause Anonymous, some of the stuff you\nlook at, you agree with what they do and\n\n1348\n01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:00,390\nyour just like,\n[LAUGH] I can't really support that but\n\n1349\n01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:04,440\nthat's, I can't support it but\nI do support it.\n\n1350\n01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,520\n>> Yeah.\n\n1351\n01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,700\n>> Last year they had one where they\nhacked the Twitter account of a KKK\n\n1352\n01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:14,980\nchapter and revealed all the identities of\nthese people saying, yeah if you're gonna\n\n1353\n01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:19,535\nsay this garbage then we're gonna put your\npictures out there so you can't hide.\n\n1354\n01:11:19,535 --> 01:11:24,100\nSo most of us would look at that, or\n\n1355\n01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:28,260\nI think all of us would look at that and\nsay, I support what they did but.\n\n1356\n01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:29,760\n>> Yeah, you wanna stand up and\napplaud them.\n\n1357\n01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,750\n>> You're kinda stuck.\n\n1358\n01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,720\n>> But at the same time Twitter's\nnot looking at it that way, right?\n\n1359\n01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,580\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz Twitter's got\n\n1360\n01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:37,410\na responsibility to their customers\nno matter who they are or whatever.\n\n1361\n01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:38,990\nAnd I don't know.\n\n1362\n01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:39,878\nThat's a tough call.\n\n1363\n01:11:39,878 --> 01:11:41,196\nIt's one of those moral things, I think.\n\n1364\n01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:45,710\n>> Yeah.\nAnd it depends on where you come down.\n\n1365\n01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:49,860\nIf you're someone that's a pen tester for\nTwitter and looking for this stuff\n\n1366\n01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:54,390\nI can't see, I can't agree with what\nthey're doing, or what they're not doing.\n\n1367\n01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:57,685\nI've just have to look at what Twitter's\ngot, that if Twitter's got an issue and\n\n1368\n01:11:57,685 --> 01:11:58,949\nI have to help them solve that.\n\n1369\n01:11:58,949 --> 01:12:01,713\n>> That's right, you accessed data that\nyou weren't supposed to have access to.\n\n1370\n01:12:01,713 --> 01:12:04,542\n>> Yeah, it's a tough thing.\n\n1371\n01:12:04,542 --> 01:12:07,876\nI'm not going to say you're going to\nhave to make those types of choices.\n\n1372\n01:12:07,876 --> 01:12:09,042\nBut you could.\n\n1373\n01:12:09,042 --> 01:12:12,250\nYou could have to end up\nmaking those types of choices.\n\n1374\n01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:18,140\nSo, but that's hacktivist,\nwe do have the criminals that come in.\n\n1375\n01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:23,140\nInteresting enough criminals have moved\na lot of their old operations that\n\n1376\n01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:27,100\nthey had in traditional space, they've\nmove it over to cyberspace because they\n\n1377\n01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:31,230\ncan really reach out and touch someone\nmuch better than they could in the past.\n\n1378\n01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:33,110\n>> Yeah.\nI always picture those in the Mafia going\n\n1379\n01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:36,450\naround to the different restaurants and\nsaying you're gonna buy protection.\n\n1380\n01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:39,470\nBut now they've got their fingers\na little further, I guess.\n\n1381\n01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:41,251\nI'm not saying the Mafia,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n1382\n01:12:41,251 --> 01:12:42,474\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't come put a head in my bed or\n\n1383\n01:12:42,474 --> 01:12:43,260\nanything like that.\n\n1384\n01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,051\n>> I don't know you.\n\n1385\n01:12:44,051 --> 01:12:46,742\n[LAUGH] So, yeah, absolutely, I mean,\n\n1386\n01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:51,220\nit opens up a whole new avenue\nof targets and victims to them.\n\n1387\n01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:52,130\n>> Oh, absolutely,\n\n1388\n01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:55,590\nin fact, that scenario you just\nmentioned is one that has occurred.\n\n1389\n01:12:55,590 --> 01:12:56,342\n>> Really?\n\n1390\n01:12:56,342 --> 01:13:01,940\n>> Where a group will attack a website,\nbefore, like a big sporting event.\n\n1391\n01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:05,967\nAnd they'll attack it and knock it off\nlong enough that the tech support people\n\n1392\n01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:10,483\nand the ISP, they can all verify that this\nisn't a technical glitch, someone's doing\n\n1393\n01:13:10,483 --> 01:13:15,260\na denial of service against you, and then\nthey release the pressure on these people.\n\n1394\n01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:18,090\nAnd then they'll call them up\nsometime very near to that and say,\n\n1395\n01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:20,640\nhey that was an unfortunate event you had.\n\n1396\n01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,490\nSo wouldn't it be bad if that happened\nbefore you started taking bets for\n\n1397\n01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:26,340\nthe Super Bowl or the Stanley Cup or\n\n1398\n01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:28,500\nwhatever they would do\nsomething like that.\n\n1399\n01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,430\nAnd the company would say\nthat would be bad and\n\n1400\n01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:35,130\nthey pay them 60, $80,000 something\nlike that because they said oh, yeah,\n\n1401\n01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:38,590\nyou're a security service,\nyou'll protect that.\n\n1402\n01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,900\nAnd then the company\nwould fix it later on.\n\n1403\n01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,190\nIt was the same variation.\n\n1404\n01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:43,753\nIt's like,\nhey this is a nice shop you have here,\n\n1405\n01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:44,843\nit'd be a shame if it burned down.\n\n1406\n01:13:44,843 --> 01:13:45,385\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n1407\n01:13:45,385 --> 01:13:46,718\n>> They just moved into cyberspace.\n\n1408\n01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:47,510\n>> I'll be darned.\n\n1409\n01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:51,442\n>> So we're seeing all sorts\nof things move on there.\n\n1410\n01:13:51,442 --> 01:13:55,680\nThen we're seeing criminals even\nfind people that have the skills,\n\n1411\n01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:59,220\nthe hacking skills that\naren't really doing much.\n\n1412\n01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,970\nThey're using social engineering skills\nto get those people on their side.\n\n1413\n01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:06,880\nThese people that are shut ins,\nmaybe don't get out a lot or something.\n\n1414\n01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,600\nThey'll say hey I'm gonna buy you a new\ncar and I'm gonna get you a girlfriend.\n\n1415\n01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,093\nThey'll do all this stuff.\n\n1416\n01:14:14,093 --> 01:14:17,093\n>> It's like they're recruiting for\ntheir little club or something like that.\n\n1417\n01:14:17,093 --> 01:14:19,093\nBuilding up an army.\n\n1418\n01:14:19,093 --> 01:14:22,040\n>> Yep.\nAnd I'm not making these scenarios up.\n\n1419\n01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,900\nEvery one of those scenarios has happened.\n\n1420\n01:14:24,900 --> 01:14:28,740\nIt's they literally have happened so\nyou can look those up.\n\n1421\n01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:31,230\nSo interesting thing.\n\n1422\n01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:33,800\n>> Yeah, so\nwe really have seen the evolution because\n\n1423\n01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,530\nit's not like it's been around that long.\n\n1424\n01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:38,900\nIt's only been the last few decades that\nwe've had even these possibilities so\n\n1425\n01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,840\nit's come a long way.\n\n1426\n01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,960\nAnd it just continues to evolve\nas the technology changes and\n\n1427\n01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,830\ngets better and less expensive.\n\n1428\n01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:48,780\nSome of the stuff that we couldn't do\nprior that you didn't have to worry about\n\n1429\n01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:51,335\nbecause they couldn't afford it,\nnow they can get their hands on it and\n\n1430\n01:14:51,335 --> 01:14:55,060\nlaunch all kinds of new types of\nattacks from different vectors.\n\n1431\n01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,560\n>> Yeah,\nit's definitely become much easier.\n\n1432\n01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:00,350\nThere's a much easier entry point now.\n\n1433\n01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,510\nUsed to be you had to have more knowledge.\n\n1434\n01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:04,520\nYou had to make your own tools.\n\n1435\n01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:08,670\nIt used to be before where if you\nlook in terms of working on a car.\n\n1436\n01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:12,605\nYou would say, well to work on this car\nI've stuck an engine and everything in it.\n\n1437\n01:15:12,605 --> 01:15:16,180\nBut, to work on it,\nyou'll have to learn to build a ratchet,\n\n1438\n01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,305\nand screwdrivers and all that.\n\n1439\n01:15:19,305 --> 01:15:22,010\nNowadays, you don't have to do that.\n\n1440\n01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:24,220\nYou don't have to write your own tools.\n\n1441\n01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,760\nThey're there.\nThey are shrink wrapped.\n\n1442\n01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,850\nYou just have to learn\nhow to read the results.\n\n1443\n01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:30,470\n>> Yeah, and in fact that reminds me of\na term that I think James mentioned in our\n\n1444\n01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:32,520\nchatroom, which was script kiddie.\n\n1445\n01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:33,410\n>> Script kiddies, yeah.\n\n1446\n01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,410\n>> Another kind of hacker\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n1447\n01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:38,670\n>> Yes, a script kiddie is an interesting\none, because we do see those.\n\n1448\n01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:42,111\nThose are hackers that don't have\nthe training wheels taken off yet,\n\n1449\n01:15:42,111 --> 01:15:43,051\nis the way I put it.\n\n1450\n01:15:43,051 --> 01:15:44,040\n>> [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n1451\n01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:49,250\n>> But the thing we should always mention\nis just because a script kiddie is\n\n1452\n01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:54,478\nlow on the food chain,\n>> It doesn't mean they're not dangerous,\n\n1453\n01:15:54,478 --> 01:16:00,740\nit's like handing something dangerous to\na monkey or something like that, you know?\n\n1454\n01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:03,420\nThat monkey, give him a stick or\nsomething, he could still hit you with it.\n\n1455\n01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:04,240\nIt would hurt.\n>> Yeah, a pistol,\n\n1456\n01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:06,040\nyou can still end up pulling\nthat trigger mistakenly.\n\n1457\n01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,460\n>> Yeah, exactly, give him a gun,\nhe doesn't know how the gun works, but,\n\n1458\n01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:11,860\nif he happens to be the one to pull\nthe trigger, you've got a problem.\n\n1459\n01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,270\nOne thing I think I've noticed with script\nkiddies a lot of times is some of your\n\n1460\n01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:19,290\nhackers, your attackers, they've got their\navenue of attack and they might look for\n\n1461\n01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:23,640\nthe easiest target or try to find somebody\nthat's vulnerable to a particular attack.\n\n1462\n01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:28,220\nScript kiddies they usually focus\non one target and they just try and\n\n1463\n01:16:28,220 --> 01:16:29,090\ntry and try and try.\n\n1464\n01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:30,280\nThey'll be very persistent.\n\n1465\n01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,330\nAnd there's just so many tools, like you\nwere saying, available are just shrink\n\n1466\n01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:35,250\nwrapped out there now that\nthey don't have to understand.\n\n1467\n01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:38,640\nThey type in an IP address or a URL,\nclick a button, and it pops up and\n\n1468\n01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,690\nsays you're now connected.\n\n1469\n01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,150\nIssue your own commands.\n\n1470\n01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:41,650\n>> Exactly.\n\n1471\n01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:44,740\n>> And they have no idea how\nthey got that connection and\n\n1472\n01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:45,810\nhow they broke through that stuff.\n\n1473\n01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:48,930\nBut it doesn't really matter if they\nunderstand or not cuz they're in.\n\n1474\n01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:49,440\n>> Exactly.\n\n1475\n01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:52,310\n>> I tell you what, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1476\n01:16:52,310 --> 01:16:55,850\nThat is probably a good place to stop for\nour break.\n\n1477\n01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:59,718\nWhen we come back, we're gonna start\ntalking about the hacking process itself.\n\n1478\n01:16:59,718 --> 01:17:01,718\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1479\n01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:08,343\n[MUSIC]\n\n1480\n01:17:08,343 --> 01:17:10,468\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1481\n01:17:10,468 --> 01:17:14,467\nIn this segment we're gonna talk about\nsome things that we need to do before\n\n1482\n01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:15,360\nwe get started.\n\n1483\n01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,970\nSome concepts that we\nneed to be familiar with.\n\n1484\n01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:21,589\nBefore we start breaking into the fun\nstuff and getting into the actual,\n\n1485\n01:17:21,589 --> 01:17:22,551\nhacking process.\n\n1486\n01:17:22,551 --> 01:17:24,760\nSo let's break it down for them, Sean.\n\n1487\n01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:28,413\n>> Okay, so yeah, what we need to\nknow before we really get started,\n\n1488\n01:17:28,413 --> 01:17:31,416\ncuz I know everyone's anxious\nin here just to kind of,\n\n1489\n01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:36,110\nsink their teeth into some stuff,\nand trust me we're getting to that.\n\n1490\n01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:39,290\nBut we still got some of\nthe appetizer to go through, right.\n\n1491\n01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,150\n>> Right.\n\n1492\n01:17:40,150 --> 01:17:41,010\n>> Is it dinner time already?\n\n1493\n01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:43,860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But\n\n1494\n01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,728\nwe have to get some of these\nthings out of the way.\n\n1495\n01:17:46,728 --> 01:17:53,470\nSo before you start, let's talk\nabout the hacking process over all.\n\n1496\n01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:57,350\nBecause this is what we're gonna be\nshining a light on when we get further\n\n1497\n01:17:57,350 --> 01:18:01,140\ninto this, so we've got to start\nacquainting ourselves with it.\n\n1498\n01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:06,860\nThe hacking process is for\nus is just a methodology we use\n\n1499\n01:18:06,860 --> 01:18:12,060\nto step through the process\nof going into a system and\n\n1500\n01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:16,220\ntaking it over and doing some other stuff.\n\n1501\n01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:21,120\nThe process starts with what\nwe call footprinting or\n\n1502\n01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,020\nis also called reconnaissance.\n\n1503\n01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,280\nI refer to it as both.\n\n1504\n01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,670\nBut footprint tends to\nbe the more formal name.\n\n1505\n01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:33,780\nBut it really is a form of doing\nreconnaissance ahead of time.\n\n1506\n01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:36,800\nSo what you're doing is when you\ndo that process, the first step,\n\n1507\n01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:41,500\nyou gain information through open\nsource means, through search engines,\n\n1508\n01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:46,540\nthrough social engineering, through a\nlittle detective work, as we were saying.\n\n1509\n01:18:46,540 --> 01:18:52,330\nAll those things are used to build the\npicture of the target you're going after.\n\n1510\n01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:55,510\n>> And I've heard people tell me that\nthis is probably one of the longest\n\n1511\n01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:56,900\nphases sometimes.\n\n1512\n01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,840\nLike, you can spend a lot of\ntime in a footprinting phase cuz\n\n1513\n01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,080\nthe more information you\ngain about that target and\n\n1514\n01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,630\nthings like that it's just gonna make the\nrest of the phases go a little smoother.\n\n1515\n01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:07,850\n>> Yes, that's true.\n\n1516\n01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:11,950\nYou need to when you go through these\nphases, what you really should be thinking\n\n1517\n01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:17,010\nof is that when you start out, you're\ngonna gain a whole bunch of information.\n\n1518\n01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:20,750\nYou're gonna gain a bunch of it and\nhave it sitting there.\n\n1519\n01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,720\nA lot of it's gonna look\nmeaningless to you.\n\n1520\n01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:26,260\nI can guarantee you're gonna see stuff in\nthere that's just not gonna look like it\n\n1521\n01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:32,980\nmeans anything at all, but as you develop\nyour eye overtime you will learn that some\n\n1522\n01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:37,690\nthings that don't look useful or aren't\nuseful initially will be useful later on.\n\n1523\n01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:41,410\nAnd I'm gonna make sure I draw your\neyes to that during this course,\n\n1524\n01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:45,630\nso you understand that there's\nthings that you can use later on, so\n\n1525\n01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:47,730\nyou start seeing these types of things.\n\n1526\n01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:50,870\nBut as you go through the process\nyou start with a lot of information.\n\n1527\n01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:54,280\nAnd then you start refining information.\n\n1528\n01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:57,450\nYou go from having a lot to\nnarrowing it down a bit more,\n\n1529\n01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,358\na bit more and a bit more.\n\n1530\n01:19:58,358 --> 01:20:03,235\nTill you get to basically a surgical type\nstrike where you're going right after\n\n1531\n01:20:03,235 --> 01:20:05,875\na specific point on\nthe system to break in.\n\n1532\n01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:10,141\nSo the more investigation you do up\nfront in the footprinting phase and\n\n1533\n01:20:10,141 --> 01:20:13,322\nin the subsequent phases\nwill help you to refine that\n\n1534\n01:20:13,322 --> 01:20:16,375\nto the point where you can\nstrike really quickly.\n\n1535\n01:20:16,375 --> 01:20:19,637\nCuz the last thing you wanna do is to get\nto the point where you're trying to hack\n\n1536\n01:20:19,637 --> 01:20:22,950\ninto a system, and you're just stumbling\naround like you have a blindfold on,\n\n1537\n01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,280\nreaching for stuff.\n\n1538\n01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,760\nThat's like a bull in a china shop,\nyou're making a lot of noise and\n\n1539\n01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,720\nsomeone's gonna pick that up.\n\n1540\n01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,680\n>> Right, you're gonna set\noff some kind of alarm and\n\n1541\n01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,960\nsomebody's gonna detect that you're there\nand that's not what you're trying to do.\n\n1542\n01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,250\n>> Exactly.\n\n1543\n01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:34,990\nExactly.\n\n1544\n01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:37,340\n>> All right, so we go through our\nfootprinting, and what comes next?\n\n1545\n01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:39,940\n>> After we go footprinting,\nwe do our scanning phase.\n\n1546\n01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:43,910\nSo, now we're starting to\ninteract with the target.\n\n1547\n01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:47,650\nWe are starting to see what types\nof things they may have open.\n\n1548\n01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:53,216\nWe're kind of seeing what doors\nthey have locked or unlocked.\n\n1549\n01:20:53,216 --> 01:20:56,177\nTo kind of put it in those types of terms,\nthe rattling doorknobs.\n\n1550\n01:20:56,177 --> 01:21:02,450\nOnce we get past scanning\nthen we go to enumeration.\n\n1551\n01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:06,846\nAnd I'll tell you just for those of us\nthat are playing along at home, and\n\n1552\n01:21:06,846 --> 01:21:09,390\ngetting ready for the EC Council stuff.\n\n1553\n01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:13,080\nThey do tend to merge scanning and\nenumeration into one phase now.\n\n1554\n01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,730\nThey're broken out into two phases,\nlike in my book, if you have that, because\n\n1555\n01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:23,070\nthere's a lot going on at those two points\nthat you really need to be aware of.\n\n1556\n01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:26,590\nThey actually used to be separate phases\nin previous versions of the exam,\n\n1557\n01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:28,010\nbut they since have merged them.\n\n1558\n01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:32,800\nBut they're still distinct enough in my\nmind that I'm covering them separately,\n\n1559\n01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:37,930\nbut I'm telling you that scanning and\nenumeration are one thing.\n\n1560\n01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:41,977\nNow once we go past scanning we got an OU,\nwe do that, we're doing the scanning phase\n\n1561\n01:21:41,977 --> 01:21:45,270\nand we move to the enumeration\npart of the scanning phase.\n\n1562\n01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:49,280\nNow what we're doing is we've found\nthe door knobs, which ones are turning,\n\n1563\n01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,350\nwhich ones are not.\n\n1564\n01:21:50,350 --> 01:21:53,620\nNow we're opening the door and seeing\nwhat's behind them, what we can get.\n\n1565\n01:21:53,620 --> 01:21:58,810\nIs there anything in that room, or\nwhat's in that room, so to speak.\n\n1566\n01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:02,310\nAnd get an idea of what\nwe can do with that.\n\n1567\n01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:05,130\nAt this enumeration you could\nbe extracting user names,\n\n1568\n01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:09,990\npasswords, share names,\nyou could actually can grab quite a bit.\n\n1569\n01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:13,478\nAnd once we get to that point you'll\nget a whole new appreciation from it.\n\n1570\n01:22:13,478 --> 01:22:14,905\nWe've got that coming up and\n\n1571\n01:22:14,905 --> 01:22:17,889\nwe'll talk about enumeration\nwhere we'll focus on that.\n\n1572\n01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:22,311\nAnd usually people are kind of surprised\nbecause you're guaranteed to learn\n\n1573\n01:22:22,311 --> 01:22:23,270\nsomething new.\n\n1574\n01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,782\n>> I tell you, just as a side note,\n\n1575\n01:22:24,782 --> 01:22:27,696\nI know we're in the middle of\nour process here but I remember,\n\n1576\n01:22:27,696 --> 01:22:31,413\nI first got certified in CEH in version,\nI think it was 4.5, or version 4.\n\n1577\n01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:33,414\nAnd I remember sitting in that class, and\n\n1578\n01:22:33,414 --> 01:22:36,685\nI was relatively new into the computer\nindustry, and everything.\n\n1579\n01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,885\nI had my NCSA and NCSE,\nand things like that.\n\n1580\n01:22:38,885 --> 01:22:42,327\nI took this class and we started getting\ninto that enumeration phase, and\n\n1581\n01:22:42,327 --> 01:22:45,650\nI just wanted to through my hands up and\ngo, what's the point?\n\n1582\n01:22:45,650 --> 01:22:47,040\nI mean, what is the point?\n\n1583\n01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,084\nHow am I ever gonna possibly\nkeep my network secure?\n\n1584\n01:22:49,084 --> 01:22:52,550\nCuz it was, some of the things were\njust too easy to get a hold of.\n\n1585\n01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,738\nAnyway, sorry, I digressed.\n\n1586\n01:22:54,738 --> 01:22:59,500\nSo we got our footprinting,\nour scanning, our enumeration.\n\n1587\n01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:04,610\n>> Yes then you're working towards\ngaining access to the system.\n\n1588\n01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:08,460\nYou are now doing something\nto penetrate that system.\n\n1589\n01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:13,335\nWhen you enumerate the system you found\nuser names, you found group names,\n\n1590\n01:23:13,335 --> 01:23:15,460\nyou found things like that.\n\n1591\n01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:18,930\nNow what you could be doing in\nthe gaining access phase is, okay,\n\n1592\n01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:21,000\nI know what user accounts are there.\n\n1593\n01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,210\nIf you have that,\n\n1594\n01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:25,276\nnow you can see if you can compromise\npasswords of those accounts.\n\n1595\n01:23:25,276 --> 01:23:27,790\nSee if you can get in further.\n\n1596\n01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:30,060\nMaybe you're going to have to\ndo a privileged escalation.\n\n1597\n01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:32,810\nIn fact,\nI can guarantee you're gonna have to.\n\n1598\n01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:35,138\nOr pretty much guarantee,\nas much as one can,\n\n1599\n01:23:35,138 --> 01:23:38,483\nthat the account that you compromised\nif you are successful at it,\n\n1600\n01:23:38,483 --> 01:23:42,266\nisn't gonna have the privileges\nyou want to plant something there.\n\n1601\n01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:44,195\nSo you're gonna need\nto grab an account and\n\n1602\n01:23:44,195 --> 01:23:48,770\ngain a foothold there, and then get\nhigher and higher privileges on a system.\n\n1603\n01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:52,256\nAnd so\nthat's how we start gaining access to it.\n\n1604\n01:23:52,256 --> 01:23:56,594\nAnd we could gain access just\nby getting the password but\n\n1605\n01:23:56,594 --> 01:23:59,648\nthere are other means that we will see.\n\n1606\n01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:04,762\nAnd then when we move to our next phase,\nit's maintaining access.\n\n1607\n01:24:04,762 --> 01:24:08,278\nMaintaining access is,\npresumably once you gain access,\n\n1608\n01:24:08,278 --> 01:24:13,678\nyou're gonna want to plant something there\nthat allows you to come back later on.\n\n1609\n01:24:13,678 --> 01:24:17,010\n>> I've gone through all this work of\ngaining access to this company's network,\n\n1610\n01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,900\nthis information, I don't wanna have to\ntry to, go through it all over again.\n\n1611\n01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,830\nSo, I wanna make it a lot\neasier where I can just kinda,\n\n1612\n01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:24,511\njump back into this\nparticular step of my attack.\n\n1613\n01:24:24,511 --> 01:24:28,280\n>> Exactly, you're gonna want\nto leave something there where\n\n1614\n01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:31,370\nyou can come back later on,\nif that's your goal.\n\n1615\n01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:34,380\nMaybe it's just you want\nto plant something there.\n\n1616\n01:24:34,380 --> 01:24:39,020\nI've seen pen tests where someone just\nwanted you, the manager, or the company,\n\n1617\n01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:41,370\nor your security director,\nor whatever said,\n\n1618\n01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:46,730\nif you want to prove my network's weak,\nfind my desktop or my notebook and\n\n1619\n01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:51,460\nput a file on the desktop, and\nwith a certain information in it.\n\n1620\n01:24:51,460 --> 01:24:54,550\nJust prove you were there, kinda like\nspray paint it on a [LAUGH] wall,\n\n1621\n01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:55,680\nI guess, type thing.\n\n1622\n01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,280\nAnd then there's no need\nto maintain access.\n\n1623\n01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:03,920\nBut it very well could be that you are\ngonna be asked to do something like that.\n\n1624\n01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:09,780\nNow after you've maintained access you're\ngonna want to do something on the way out.\n\n1625\n01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:14,044\nJust clean up after yourself,\nwhich is cleaning up your tracks,\n\n1626\n01:25:14,044 --> 01:25:17,385\nor covering your tracks as\nthey sometimes call it.\n\n1627\n01:25:17,385 --> 01:25:21,668\nAnd the idea behind this is,\nif you look at what you've just done,\n\n1628\n01:25:21,668 --> 01:25:25,954\nall those previous phases,\nwhat you've done in terms of a crime,\n\n1629\n01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:30,773\nwhat you have is you have a situation\nwhere, if you were gonna commit a crime\n\n1630\n01:25:30,773 --> 01:25:34,704\nlike breaking into a house,\nwhich some of you may have done.\n\n1631\n01:25:34,704 --> 01:25:37,316\nNo, I'm just playing.\n\n1632\n01:25:37,316 --> 01:25:38,406\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Hopefully not, but\n\n1633\n01:25:38,406 --> 01:25:39,237\n[LAUGH] if you have you know what we mean.\n\n1634\n01:25:39,237 --> 01:25:41,849\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, yes,\nall you felons out there.\n\n1635\n01:25:41,849 --> 01:25:47,352\nBut what we have is if you think about\nin terms of breaking into a house.\n\n1636\n01:25:47,352 --> 01:25:50,094\nIf you break into a house,\nyou've got a couple ways of doing it.\n\n1637\n01:25:50,094 --> 01:25:54,432\nYou throw a brick through the window,\nand go in and start turning stuff over,\n\n1638\n01:25:54,432 --> 01:25:56,993\nlooking for\nthat one thing that's of value.\n\n1639\n01:25:56,993 --> 01:25:58,798\n>> Just ransack the place, yeah.\n>> And if someone sees that,\n\n1640\n01:25:58,798 --> 01:26:02,265\nthey don't know what you stole but\nthey know somebody was there.\n\n1641\n01:26:02,265 --> 01:26:07,320\n[LAUGH] And now it's gonna cause\nthem to investigate further.\n\n1642\n01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:12,090\nThe other way to do it is you could do\na footprint-type thing where you drive by\n\n1643\n01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:15,820\nthe house, you learn where the neighbors\nare, you learn who lives there, you start\n\n1644\n01:26:15,820 --> 01:26:19,770\ndoing investigation, and get more and\nmore information about that target.\n\n1645\n01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:23,421\nAnd then you figure out when the neighbors\naren't there or most of them aren't there,\n\n1646\n01:26:23,421 --> 01:26:25,583\nwhen the people that own\nthat house aren't there.\n\n1647\n01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:28,530\nAnd then you go in an pick a lock and\ngo in and\n\n1648\n01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:32,506\nfind that one item that's of\nvalue to you and you leave.\n\n1649\n01:26:32,506 --> 01:26:33,963\n>> So\nnobody ever even knows you were there.\n\n1650\n01:26:33,963 --> 01:26:35,652\n>> Yeah, you're in and out.\n\n1651\n01:26:35,652 --> 01:26:41,420\n>> The thing is that they may eventually\nfind evidence that something's\n\n1652\n01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:48,005\namiss there, because that piece of jewelry\nyou stole or whatever else is gone.\n\n1653\n01:26:48,005 --> 01:26:50,680\nBut presumably by the time they find that,\nthe tracks have gotten so\n\n1654\n01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:55,380\ncold that the chance of it ever\ngetting solved are unlikely.\n\n1655\n01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:59,129\nSo that's kind of the same thing\nhere is that we cover our tracks,\n\n1656\n01:26:59,129 --> 01:27:02,758\nwe're trying to erase that\nevidence of that event happening.\n\n1657\n01:27:02,758 --> 01:27:03,683\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Cause we are gonna leave\n\n1658\n01:27:03,683 --> 01:27:04,607\nevidence along the way.\n\n1659\n01:27:04,607 --> 01:27:08,232\nWe're gonna maybe leave entries in log\nfiles and things like that on a routers\n\n1660\n01:27:08,232 --> 01:27:12,022\nyou have to go through, or log on times\nfor an account that shouldn't be logged on\n\n1661\n01:27:12,022 --> 01:27:14,677\nin those particular hours,\nand then things like that.\n\n1662\n01:27:14,677 --> 01:27:17,181\nSo you're gonna end up leaving,\nhopefully not too much, but\n\n1663\n01:27:17,181 --> 01:27:18,531\nyou're gonna leave evidence and\n\n1664\n01:27:18,531 --> 01:27:21,440\nI need to get rid of that to try to\ndelay them finding out that I was there.\n\n1665\n01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,743\n>> Yeah, you bring up a very good point by\nsaying this is about leaving things in log\n\n1666\n01:27:25,743 --> 01:27:27,233\nfiles and stuff like that.\n\n1667\n01:27:27,233 --> 01:27:30,460\nOne of the skills that's\ngonna be very good for\n\n1668\n01:27:30,460 --> 01:27:36,260\na pen tester to have is to pay attention\nto that detail and what they're doing.\n\n1669\n01:27:36,260 --> 01:27:41,080\nThis is where the experience, the hands on\ncomes in, and you practicing these skills.\n\n1670\n01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:46,810\nBecause you have to learn what it is\nyou're doing and what could be detected.\n\n1671\n01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:49,580\nSo once you figure out\nwhat could be detected and\n\n1672\n01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:53,670\nwhat's out there,\nyou know what you need to clean up.\n\n1673\n01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:57,197\nYou also know what to do on the way in\nto keep from leaving as big a footprint.\n\n1674\n01:27:57,197 --> 01:27:58,799\n>> To minimize what you're leaving, yeah.\n\n1675\n01:27:58,799 --> 01:28:02,642\n>> Yeah, the less things you manipulate\nand knock over, and cause problems with,\n\n1676\n01:28:02,642 --> 01:28:04,692\nthat's the less stuff you gotta clean up.\n\n1677\n01:28:04,692 --> 01:28:06,980\nThat's the less stuff they can detect.\n\n1678\n01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:10,192\nRemember when you're doing this,\none of the things\n\n1679\n01:28:10,192 --> 01:28:14,500\nthat you very well could be testing\nis not just their infrastructure.\n\n1680\n01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:18,292\nYou could be testing their response time\nand their ability to detect an attack.\n\n1681\n01:28:18,292 --> 01:28:19,208\n>> That's a very good point.\n\n1682\n01:28:19,208 --> 01:28:19,958\nDidn't think about that.\n\n1683\n01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:23,368\nSo not only are we testing their\ninfrastructure and whether we can get into\n\n1684\n01:28:23,368 --> 01:28:26,558\nit, Gain access to sensitive data,\nbut the boss might want to know,\n\n1685\n01:28:26,558 --> 01:28:29,650\nhe's paying people good money to\nkeep this network secure right?\n\n1686\n01:28:29,650 --> 01:28:33,276\nAnd so I need to know if they're doing\ntheir job, or if their doing it well, or\n\n1687\n01:28:33,276 --> 01:28:36,570\ndo they need more training or hire more\npeople or whatever the case may be.\n\n1688\n01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:39,110\n>> Well, that's a good point.\n\n1689\n01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,642\nThat would be your administrative side,\n\n1690\n01:28:40,642 --> 01:28:42,830\nyou're testing their\ninstant response policy.\n\n1691\n01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:43,330\n>> Nice.\n\n1692\n01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:46,740\nAll right so we've got,\nlet's see if we can remember now.\n\n1693\n01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:50,510\nSo we've got our foot printing, we've got\nour scanning, we've got our enumeration,\n\n1694\n01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:53,950\nwe've got gaining access,\nwe've got maintaining access.\n\n1695\n01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:55,910\nAnd then we go into covering tracks.\n\n1696\n01:28:55,910 --> 01:28:56,510\n>> Yes.\n\n1697\n01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,500\n>> That's a pretty good process.\n\n1698\n01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,870\n>> Yeah.\nIt is a very good process.\n\n1699\n01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:04,690\nThis process, you're gonna more or\nless follow it.\n\n1700\n01:29:04,690 --> 01:29:07,490\nFor EC Councels purposes,\nfor their exam, this is it.\n\n1701\n01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:10,580\nThis is kind of the ones that\nthey've blessed, so to speak.\n\n1702\n01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:15,960\nBut out there in the real world when\nyou're doing your own pen testing\n\n1703\n01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:21,460\non your own, you might find that you\ndevelop kind of your own process.\n\n1704\n01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:23,810\nBut you'll find it pretty\nmuch follows this,\n\n1705\n01:29:23,810 --> 01:29:26,760\neven though you may not\ncall it the same thing.\n\n1706\n01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:31,000\nYou'll tend to have a process that\nfollows that same line of thinking.\n\n1707\n01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:36,190\nThe important thing for me,\nwhen I'm impressing this on you.\n\n1708\n01:29:36,190 --> 01:29:39,560\nIs that, have a process that you follow.\n\n1709\n01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:40,620\nHave a structured process.\n\n1710\n01:29:40,620 --> 01:29:43,572\nWhat I don't want to see is I want\nto see a carpet bombing approach,\n\n1711\n01:29:43,572 --> 01:29:45,750\nwhere you're just kind of reaching for\nthings.\n\n1712\n01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:49,972\nAnd what happens is that there's no\nstructure to it, there's no rhyme or\n\n1713\n01:29:49,972 --> 01:29:50,800\nreason to it.\n\n1714\n01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:54,501\nAnd that has a much greater\nchance of being unsuccessful for\n\n1715\n01:29:54,501 --> 01:29:59,370\nyou and being successful for them and\ndetecting you and stopping you.\n\n1716\n01:29:59,370 --> 01:30:01,360\nYou have to have a methodology.\n\n1717\n01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,600\nI also want you to think about these\nprocesses when we go through, and\n\n1718\n01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,320\nI'll emphasize this as we\nget to those episodes.\n\n1719\n01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:12,040\nThat what you are supposed to be getting\nout of get it out of phase as deliverables\n\n1720\n01:30:12,040 --> 01:30:14,800\nand what those deliverables\nmean to the next phase\n\n1721\n01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,250\nbecause what comes out of one\nphase goes into the next.\n\n1722\n01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:21,410\n>> So that's you setting your goals,\nwhat do I want to get out of this phase.\n\n1723\n01:30:21,410 --> 01:30:25,000\nAt the end of this phase I want to have so\nmuch information about this company.\n\n1724\n01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,120\nOr by the time I get down with this phase\nI should have a list of a few different\n\n1725\n01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,690\nusernames that I can then\ntake on to the next phase and\n\n1726\n01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:33,570\nstart to try to gain access with.\n\n1727\n01:30:33,570 --> 01:30:34,350\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1728\n01:30:34,350 --> 01:30:37,600\n>> So having those goals in mind when\nyou're going through the phase is\n\n1729\n01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:39,210\ngoing to make you more successful.\n\n1730\n01:30:39,210 --> 01:30:39,910\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1731\n01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:42,370\n>> Good, good.\n\n1732\n01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:47,230\nSo you say we set our goals,\nwe got our attack phase, we set our goals.\n\n1733\n01:30:47,230 --> 01:30:49,910\nGetting a consensus.\n\n1734\n01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:50,520\nConsensus.\n\n1735\n01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:51,493\nI read that wrong there.\n\n1736\n01:30:51,493 --> 01:30:54,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We have a conscience, we are ethical.\n\n1737\n01:30:54,970 --> 01:30:56,420\n>> That was a test.\n\n1738\n01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:01,875\n>> All right.\n>> So, getting consensus.\n\n1739\n01:31:01,875 --> 01:31:05,605\nThis is probably going to be\none of your trickiest parts.\n\n1740\n01:31:05,605 --> 01:31:08,765\nI'm not kidding about this.\n\n1741\n01:31:08,765 --> 01:31:13,435\nIf you remember earlier when I was talking\nabout having good personal skills.\n\n1742\n01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:15,475\nI said you have to learn how to do it.\n\n1743\n01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:17,385\nThis is where that comes back,\n\n1744\n01:31:17,385 --> 01:31:21,100\nis that you're gonna have\nto interview your client.\n\n1745\n01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:25,260\nThat's just the nature of the beast\ncuz you've gotta figure out what they\n\n1746\n01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,260\nwanna accomplish.\n\n1747\n01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,115\nThat sounds like, well just go ask them.\n\n1748\n01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:31,780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not that easy.\n\n1749\n01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,930\nIt's just not.\n\n1750\n01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:38,070\nAnybody that works in IT support,\n\n1751\n01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:42,100\nhas to work with end users,\nknows that that's not an easy proposition.\n\n1752\n01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:44,680\n>> Yeah, and a lot of times,\nthey really don't know what they want.\n\n1753\n01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:47,370\nThey have an idea, but it becomes hard for\n\n1754\n01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:50,610\nthem to verbalize it, cuz they don't have\nthe terminology, and things like that.\n\n1755\n01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:52,730\nSo, we end up deciphering a lot of it, and\n\n1756\n01:31:52,730 --> 01:31:54,980\ntrying, it's kind of like\npulling teeth sometimes.\n\n1757\n01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:59,340\nI mean, you're trying to ask them leading\nquestions to get that information out.\n\n1758\n01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:02,810\n>> And you hit the nail on the head.\n\n1759\n01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:04,870\nThey know what they want but\nthey don't know what they want.\n\n1760\n01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:07,540\nThey don't have the phrase and\nthe terminology.\n\n1761\n01:32:07,540 --> 01:32:11,350\nThat's where you do and they don't.\n\n1762\n01:32:11,350 --> 01:32:12,950\nSo you've gotta kind of bridge that gap.\n\n1763\n01:32:12,950 --> 01:32:14,690\nThat's your personal skills.\n\n1764\n01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:20,870\nThat's where you've gotta say, ok well,\ntell me about your environment,\n\n1765\n01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:26,002\ntell me what drove you to call me here and\nstart getting that information.\n\n1766\n01:32:26,002 --> 01:32:28,130\nAnd once you start getting more and\n\n1767\n01:32:28,130 --> 01:32:31,730\nmore information then you can start\nsteering the conversation a bit more and\n\n1768\n01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:37,190\nnarrowing it down and\nhelping them tell you what they need.\n\n1769\n01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:40,940\nAnd once you have that then you\ncan gain consensus on that and\n\n1770\n01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:43,920\nsay okay this is what we're\ntrying to accomplish.\n\n1771\n01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:48,840\nBut don't be surprised if they just plain\nand simple don't know what they want.\n\n1772\n01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,380\nIt's sometimes when they\ncall it a pen tester.\n\n1773\n01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:55,493\nWhen their request to you is\nthe equivalent of going to the doctor and\n\n1774\n01:32:55,493 --> 01:32:57,166\nsaying I don't feel good.\n\n1775\n01:32:57,166 --> 01:32:59,626\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He's like, well that's good.\n\n1776\n01:32:59,626 --> 01:33:03,666\n>> So it's up to doctor to figure out\nwell, is it your arm, your leg, your head?\n\n1777\n01:33:03,666 --> 01:33:06,760\nI mean, where is this pain coming from and\ntrying to get it.\n\n1778\n01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:10,820\nThey might have called you in because\nthey've had a previous breech and\n\n1779\n01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:11,980\nnow they're worried about security.\n\n1780\n01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:15,170\nIt could be something that they've\nseen another company in the same\n\n1781\n01:33:15,170 --> 01:33:17,770\nfield have issues and\nthey're worried about themselves.\n\n1782\n01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:20,220\nSo, a lot of different reasons\nthey might be calling you in.\n\n1783\n01:33:20,220 --> 01:33:23,300\nAnd as Sean said,\nthey're not really sure what they want.\n\n1784\n01:33:23,300 --> 01:33:27,400\nThey know they need something and\nwe have to be able to try to decipher\n\n1785\n01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,570\nfrom them what it is they're\nlooking to get out of this.\n\n1786\n01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:30,920\nWhy are they paying you?\n\n1787\n01:33:30,920 --> 01:33:34,020\nBecause in the end if you\ndon't deliver what they wanted\n\n1788\n01:33:34,020 --> 01:33:36,060\nwe're gonna have a problem building and\nthings like that.\n\n1789\n01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:40,720\nSo you've gotta make sure you understand\nand that you agree the outcome in the end.\n\n1790\n01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:41,330\nWhat should it be?\n\n1791\n01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:43,570\nWhat are, like you mentioned,\nthe term deliverables?\n\n1792\n01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:44,570\nWhat do they want?\n\n1793\n01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:48,080\nDo they want that notepad\ntext file on the desktop?\n\n1794\n01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,300\nDo they want a list of their payroll that\nyou weren't meant to have access to?\n\n1795\n01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:53,400\nWhat is it that they need?\n\n1796\n01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,026\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1797\n01:33:54,026 --> 01:34:01,370\nAnd remember just to cast this in another\nlight when you gain consensus is you also\n\n1798\n01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:07,380\nwhen you get a contract put together you\nwant to have it defined what it is you're\n\n1799\n01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:11,490\nsupposed to be accomplishing cuz how are\nyou gonna know you're done, first of all?\n\n1800\n01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:12,470\nWhat did you accomplish?\n\n1801\n01:34:12,470 --> 01:34:16,460\nWell I've met all these things\non the checklist that's for one.\n\n1802\n01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:21,670\nThe other thing is your doing a little\nCYB, covering your butt on this.\n\n1803\n01:34:21,670 --> 01:34:26,543\nBecause you don't want to be in\na situation where things are defined so\n\n1804\n01:34:26,543 --> 01:34:32,340\nbroadly and so vaguely that you go and do\nsomething and they say we don't want that.\n\n1805\n01:34:32,340 --> 01:34:35,880\nAnd now you're liable for\nsome damages or worse.\n\n1806\n01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:38,520\n>> You brought down one of their web\nservers during your pen tests and\n\n1807\n01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,550\nthey lose hundreds of thousands of\ndollars an hour for bringing that down.\n\n1808\n01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:44,817\nAnd if you didn't have that defined that\nthis is a possibility during the exam,\n\n1809\n01:34:44,817 --> 01:34:46,546\nthey might try to turn around and sue you.\n\n1810\n01:34:46,546 --> 01:34:48,960\nIn fact,\nMike had a good question in the chatroom.\n\n1811\n01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,600\nHow deep should you get on\na get out of jail letter?\n\n1812\n01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,320\nWhat are some of the things\nthat we wanna put in there?\n\n1813\n01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:58,580\nIs there a way to quantify that even?\n\n1814\n01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:02,280\nOr is that's just kinda per scenario\nkinda thing you have to deal with?\n\n1815\n01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,340\n>> That's your contract.\n\n1816\n01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:04,050\nIt's really what that is.\n\n1817\n01:35:04,050 --> 01:35:05,220\nThat's the way I look at it.\n\n1818\n01:35:05,220 --> 01:35:09,610\nThat's your contract, if you've done\nyour interview process correctly.\n\n1819\n01:35:09,610 --> 01:35:12,360\nOr thoroughly, I shouldn't say correctly,\nbut thoroughly and\n\n1820\n01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,420\nhave things documented on there.\n\n1821\n01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,210\nThat should serve you for that.\n\n1822\n01:35:16,210 --> 01:35:21,527\nNow if you are doing something\nwhere you are going on site and\n\n1823\n01:35:21,527 --> 01:35:24,090\ndoing social engineering.\n\n1824\n01:35:24,090 --> 01:35:27,149\nThen you're always going to have,\nand I would say across the board,\n\n1825\n01:35:27,149 --> 01:35:29,999\nalways have and it’s very important for\nsocial engineering and\n\n1826\n01:35:29,999 --> 01:35:33,490\nphysically going and visiting the site and\ntrying to manipulate it.\n\n1827\n01:35:33,490 --> 01:35:38,710\nIs have the names a phone numbers\nof the people that authorized this,\n\n1828\n01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:40,580\nthat's what I would consider\na get out of jail free card.\n\n1829\n01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:41,902\nYou got.\n>> So if they grab you and\n\n1830\n01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:44,080\nthrowing you in a room and call the cops.\n\n1831\n01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:45,398\n>> Yeah.\n>> You've got proof that hey look,\n\n1832\n01:35:45,398 --> 01:35:47,090\nno no no, I know the boss\nI'm not just name dropping.\n\n1833\n01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:47,800\nHere's his name.\n\n1834\n01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:48,670\n>> Yeah before they start\nbreaking knee caps.\n\n1835\n01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,420\n>> Here's his number.\n\n1836\n01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,490\n>> Yeah you need to.\n\n1837\n01:35:52,490 --> 01:35:55,260\nAnd that's thinking ahead,\nyou want to have that.\n\n1838\n01:35:55,260 --> 01:36:00,500\nAnd there's actually, I can see some\nother very good questions in here,\n\n1839\n01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,690\nhave it written by a lawyer.\n\n1840\n01:36:01,690 --> 01:36:04,310\nYeah.\nIf you don't know how to write these\n\n1841\n01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,115\nthings, you better get a lawyer.\n\n1842\n01:36:06,115 --> 01:36:09,635\nThere's really not a true\nboilerplate type thing you can get.\n\n1843\n01:36:09,635 --> 01:36:15,292\nThose things have to be kinda\nwritten with a specific purpose.\n\n1844\n01:36:15,292 --> 01:36:19,630\nThere's actually a lot of paths\nthis can go down right now.\n\n1845\n01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:22,167\nBut I'll bring up at least\none specific scenario.\n\n1846\n01:36:22,167 --> 01:36:26,330\nWhat if you are doing an audit for\nsomebody in the payment card industry?\n\n1847\n01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,760\nNow, I don't know if\nany of you do that but\n\n1848\n01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,750\nif you work in the payment card industry\nor you want to be a pen test for\n\n1849\n01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:38,660\nthe payment card industry, they have\na board that actually, that handles that,\n\n1850\n01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:41,860\nand you actually as a pen tester\nhave to get authorized by them,\n\n1851\n01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:44,360\nshow you're bonded and\nall this other stuff.\n\n1852\n01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:49,350\nand then every pen test you do, people\nthat are in the payment card industry have\n\n1853\n01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:54,300\nto submit reviews on you, so they\nactually know how well you're doing and\n\n1854\n01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:58,835\nwhat's going on, and\npeople in that industry are allowed to use\n\n1855\n01:36:58,835 --> 01:37:02,675\nthe pen testers that\nare authorized by that.\n\n1856\n01:37:02,675 --> 01:37:08,325\nThey're trying to make sure\nthat they are covered and\n\n1857\n01:37:08,325 --> 01:37:11,525\nmeet a certain level of quality and\nget the right things tested.\n\n1858\n01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:14,195\nSo you would need to know those things.\n\n1859\n01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:18,955\nSo if you need to do a pen test for\nan instrument you're not familiar with,\n\n1860\n01:37:18,955 --> 01:37:21,940\nyou might do some checking to\nsee if you can find that out.\n\n1861\n01:37:21,940 --> 01:37:25,440\nWe had another good question,\nI think Michael was asking as well,\n\n1862\n01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:29,650\nis we talk about getting permission as\nto what ethical hacking is all about is\n\n1863\n01:37:29,650 --> 01:37:32,820\nmaking sure that we have permission\nto do this penetration test or\n\n1864\n01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:34,550\nwhat they're asking us to do.\n\n1865\n01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:37,780\nHow do I know who the right\nperson is within that company.\n\n1866\n01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:40,160\nIf I'm talking to the senior IT guy,\n\n1867\n01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:44,240\ndoes he have the authorization\nto allow this test?\n\n1868\n01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:47,422\nOr do I need to go higher up and\nsometimes how do I know?\n\n1869\n01:37:47,422 --> 01:37:51,911\nIs there a really good way, or do you got\nto work your way up the food chain and\n\n1870\n01:37:51,911 --> 01:37:54,285\nmake sure you ask the right questions?\n\n1871\n01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:56,595\n>> You may, very well,\nhave to work your way up the food chain.\n\n1872\n01:37:56,595 --> 01:38:01,668\nI wouldn't say it was unreasonable to get\nsomebody that's at a C-level position or\n\n1873\n01:38:01,668 --> 01:38:06,750\ndirector position to say they have to sign\noff on this if a director position exists.\n\n1874\n01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,690\nIf not, get somebody at\nthe C-level that does that.\n\n1875\n01:38:09,690 --> 01:38:15,770\nAnd technically that would be one\nof the best ways to cover yourself,\n\n1876\n01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:19,120\nbecause when you go to\npeople at the C level,\n\n1877\n01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:22,960\nthe chief, whatever level,\nthey are legally responsible for\n\n1878\n01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,630\nthe organization and\nthe data and everything else.\n\n1879\n01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:27,600\nSo as the captain of that ship so\n\n1880\n01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,080\nto speak they're the ones that\ncan truly authorize that.\n\n1881\n01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,830\nYou know, in every case.\n\n1882\n01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:34,330\n>> Good, good.\n\n1883\n01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:39,160\nI hope that answers your question\nMichael and the rest of you out there.\n\n1884\n01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:42,720\nAll right so we've talked about a lot\nof the things that we need to do.\n\n1885\n01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,680\nThat we're gonna break down those phases\nin a little bit and things like that.\n\n1886\n01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:48,170\nWhat about some things\nthat we shouldn't do?\n\n1887\n01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:51,280\nI'm sure there's a few of those no-nos\nout there that we've gotta worry about.\n\n1888\n01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,200\n>> There's a lot of landmines\nout there definitely.\n\n1889\n01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:55,450\n>> Right?\n\n1890\n01:38:55,450 --> 01:38:56,580\n>> Things not to do.\n\n1891\n01:38:56,580 --> 01:39:01,550\nI think we've hit on one of\nthem already and I think it's\n\n1892\n01:39:01,550 --> 01:39:06,960\nimportant to kind of mention it again You\nknow, never without permission, okay?\n\n1893\n01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:09,974\nI, to be blunt,\nI don't care about your intent at all,\n\n1894\n01:39:09,974 --> 01:39:13,692\nyou can be the best guy out there,\nbut if you don't have permission,\n\n1895\n01:39:13,692 --> 01:39:18,119\nit's illegal and that will get you in\ntrouble, it's absolutely gonna get you get\n\n1896\n01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:22,275\nyou in trouble, so don't do that,\n>> The movie thing where you hack\n\n1897\n01:39:22,275 --> 01:39:22,935\nthe company and\n\n1898\n01:39:22,935 --> 01:39:27,297\nget a job is not gonna happen\n>> Yea that's extremely rare, you might as\n\n1899\n01:39:27,297 --> 01:39:30,685\nwell go play the lottery, you probably\nhave a better chance of doing that.\n\n1900\n01:39:30,685 --> 01:39:33,540\nYou're gonna get into legal\ntrouble very quickly.\n\n1901\n01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:37,050\nAnd it has been known to\nhappen more than once.\n\n1902\n01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:39,000\nSo, yeah, you have that.\n\n1903\n01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:43,040\nOther things that are, that you don't do,\n\n1904\n01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:47,700\ndon't ever deviate from your\ncontracts that you've been given.\n\n1905\n01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:49,660\nIf someone just comes to you and\nsays, hey,\n\n1906\n01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:53,620\ncould you perform this as part of\nyour test, we want to add this in.\n\n1907\n01:39:53,620 --> 01:39:57,150\nYou don't just say oh yeah, good,\nwe can go ahead and do that.\n\n1908\n01:39:57,150 --> 01:40:00,030\nNo, that's where you add an addendum\nto the contract to say ok,\n\n1909\n01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:05,220\nwe are going to cover this\nadditional thing before you do it.\n\n1910\n01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:08,080\n>> Because you still need those same\nlevel of authority that signed off on\n\n1911\n01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,895\nthe original contract has to approve\nthis change to what you're going to do.\n\n1912\n01:40:11,895 --> 01:40:14,150\nCause that person is saying,\nhey could you go ahead and test this?\n\n1913\n01:40:14,150 --> 01:40:16,880\nI wrote this database for this little\napplication we're running in house, and\n\n1914\n01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,060\nI was just wondering, while you're here,\ncould you go ahead and\n\n1915\n01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:20,790\ndo some testing on it?\n\n1916\n01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:23,560\nNot thinking that maybe that could\naffect another part of the network and\n\n1917\n01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,200\nthings like that.\n\n1918\n01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:25,610\nHe didn't see the big picture.\n\n1919\n01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:28,000\nSo It's always important to make\nsure we've got that permission.\n\n1920\n01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:33,820\nAnd I liken it to, for you project\nmanagement folks, to scope creep, right?\n\n1921\n01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:37,010\nYou don't wanna let your\ntests start creeping and\n\n1922\n01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:41,810\ngetting outside of the boundaries\nthat you've defined in that contract.\n\n1923\n01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:46,145\n>> Yeah scope creep can be a very\nbad situation to get yourself into.\n\n1924\n01:40:46,145 --> 01:40:49,645\nAnd there ain't no ointment\nthat can take that away.\n\n1925\n01:40:49,645 --> 01:40:54,425\nSo make sure that everything's\ndocumented when you do this stuff.\n\n1926\n01:40:54,425 --> 01:40:57,115\nDon't let them start adding more and\nmore stuff to it.\n\n1927\n01:40:57,115 --> 01:41:00,135\nGet it documented and\nthen perform those actions.\n\n1928\n01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,610\nSo, that would be a big one.\n\n1929\n01:41:03,610 --> 01:41:07,920\nOther things I would say what not to do,\njust to kind of reiterate them,\n\n1930\n01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:12,980\ndon't let a client tell you, that, hey,\nwell our stuff is being hosted at such and\n\n1931\n01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:17,980\nsuch, so, as long as you touch our\nstuff out in the cloud, you're fine.\n\n1932\n01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:19,860\nYou're not fine.\n\n1933\n01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:20,430\nThey don't own it.\n\n1934\n01:41:20,430 --> 01:41:25,480\nUnless, it's a private cloud, that they\nbuilt on premises it's not theirs.\n\n1935\n01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,430\nThat also goes for if you are using, or\n\n1936\n01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:32,120\nhacking through their\nISP onto their systems.\n\n1937\n01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:35,390\nYou're going to want to let their ISP\nknow that this activity is occurring.\n\n1938\n01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:40,820\nBecause not only will most ISP's shut that\ndown pretty quickly, they could also turn\n\n1939\n01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:46,155\nit around on you pretty quickly,\nand before you,\n\n1940\n01:41:46,155 --> 01:41:49,550\n[LAUGH] before it's all resolved, even\nif you were allowed to do the pen test,\n\n1941\n01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:53,870\nthe ISP could cause you a lot of\nproblems before all is said and done.\n\n1942\n01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:57,940\nAnd so, you wanna make sure that you\nhave everything adequately covered.\n\n1943\n01:41:57,940 --> 01:42:00,430\nThat's why you ask questions.\n\n1944\n01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:03,920\nIf you have to go through multiple\ninterviews to get everything on the same\n\n1945\n01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,590\npage, do so.\n\n1946\n01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:08,154\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1947\n01:42:08,154 --> 01:42:12,200\nAlright, Sean, well I think we've\ncovered a lot of information here.\n\n1948\n01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,735\nDo we have anything else we\nwanna add to our first episode,\n\n1949\n01:42:14,735 --> 01:42:17,060\ngetting started with our hacking?\n\n1950\n01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:19,560\nHey I'm ready to go onto the big stuff.\n\n1951\n01:42:19,560 --> 01:42:20,220\n>> I know right.\n\n1952\n01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:22,100\nI know everybody else out\nthere's excited as well.\n\n1953\n01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:24,200\nAll right ladies and\ngentleman, I'll tell you what.\n\n1954\n01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:28,650\nThat's gonna wrap it up for\nepisode one for our CEH program.\n\n1955\n01:42:28,650 --> 01:42:30,130\nWe went over a lot of stuff today.\n\n1956\n01:42:30,130 --> 01:42:32,658\nWe covered or\ntalked about this history of hacking,\n\n1957\n01:42:32,658 --> 01:42:37,130\nsome of the background of kind of where it\nstarted, and the evolution of cyber crime.\n\n1958\n01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:41,760\nTalked about what ethical hacking is and\nwhat that term ethical, that oxymoron,\n\n1959\n01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:43,610\nwe kind of explained that a little bit.\n\n1960\n01:42:43,610 --> 01:42:46,775\nTalked about the skills that\nare gonna be required of you.\n\n1961\n01:42:46,775 --> 01:42:49,615\nIf you want to become a good\npenetration tester, and ethical hacker.\n\n1962\n01:42:49,615 --> 01:42:53,608\nWe talked about the different\ntypes of hats, the white hats, and\n\n1963\n01:42:53,608 --> 01:42:56,105\nthe black hats, and the grey hats.\n\n1964\n01:42:56,105 --> 01:43:00,962\nand we rounded up the day with a basic\ntalk about the the hacking process.\n\n1965\n01:43:00,962 --> 01:43:04,472\nAnd some of the things we\nneed to have with us and\n\n1966\n01:43:04,472 --> 01:43:07,982\nskill sets that we need to\nhave before we get started.\n\n1967\n01:43:07,982 --> 01:43:09,942\nSo I hope you guys enjoyed today's show.\n\n1968\n01:43:09,942 --> 01:43:12,592\nIt was great having everybody here.\n\n1969\n01:43:12,592 --> 01:43:13,832\nRemember, as always,\n\n1970\n01:43:13,832 -->

00:00:38,796\nwelcome to another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:41,587\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Shawn Orian.\n\n5\n00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:42,712\nHow ya doing Shawn?\n\n6\n00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:43,837\n>> Not too bad how are you doing?\n\n7\n00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:44,379\n>> Fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:45,046\nFantastic.\n\n9\n00:00:45,046 --> 00:00:48,245\nGlad to be here and\nsuper excited to be here.\n\n10\n00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:53,074\nWe are starting up episode number\ntwo in our CEH episodes and to,\n\n11\n00:00:53,074 --> 00:00:56,671\ntoday, we're gonna be\ngoing over cryptography.\n\n12\n00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,490\nSo a lot of things we're gonna talk about,\ncryptography, cryptography obviously\n\n13\n00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,171\na very important part of you know,\nkeeping our information confidential.\n\n14\n00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:08,623\nMaking sure that unauthorized people are\nnot gaining access to that information.\n\n15\n00:01:08,623 --> 00:01:11,421\nSo where do we wanna\nstart with cryptography?\n\n16\n00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:14,929\n>> Well, to start with cryptography, it's\nprobably important to kind of at least,\n\n17\n00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:17,046\nyou know,\nset the stage on what cryptography is.\n\n18\n00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:20,675\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So let, let's go ahead and do that.\n\n19\n00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:25,348\nCryptography is really just one portion\nof knowledge that deals with how to\n\n20\n00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:30,393\nprotect information as well as how to\nverify the integrity of information,\n\n21\n00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:34,421\nso it's, it's dealing with you know,\nthose two things.\n\n22\n00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:39,203\nMost people are familiar with the\nscrambling and unscrambling of data, which\n\n23\n00:01:39,203 --> 00:01:44,212\nis the, the encryption decryption part,\nbut there's much more to it than that.\n\n24\n00:01:44,212 --> 00:01:49,410\nSo we kinda gotta explore,\nyou know, what that means to us.\n\n25\n00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,115\nI always like to emphasize when I talk\nabout cryptography, we are gonna be using\n\n26\n00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:59,312\ntechnology in here to illustrate to\nillustrate what, how cryptography works\n\n27\n00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:04,046\nand how to apply it, but cryptography is\nbeen around for ages and ages and ages.\n\n28\n00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:08,385\nSo we're gonna kind of take a look at some\nof those historic ones not just to give\n\n29\n00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:12,167\nyou a trip down memory lane, [LAUGH] but\nalso because some of the older ones\n\n30\n00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,701\nare simple enough to illustrate\nthe points of cryptography but\n\n31\n00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:19,174\nthey not only do they illustrate\nthe points of cryptography,\n\n32\n00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,421\nthey also give us a nice\nsimple way to do it.\n\n33\n00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,060\nYou know, you don't have to get\nsome big complex thing where we're\n\n34\n00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,772\nin a lab coat and\nsketching on a white board or\n\n35\n00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:26,379\nsomething-\n>> Yeah.\n\n36\n00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,047\n>> We don't want to do that.\n\n37\n00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,830\n>> Right, exactly.\nWe wanna explain cryptography, but\n\n38\n00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,400\nwe don't wanna require you to have an,\nan engineering or\n\n39\n00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,254\nmathematical degree in order\nto understand the explanation.\n\n40\n00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,917\nSo we can use some of those simple\nalgorithms or even go back further before\n\n41\n00:02:37,917 --> 00:02:41,805\nit was even mathematical to explain the\nconcepts, because it, it still applies,\n\n42\n00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:44,913\nit's just that it's gotten more\nadvanced with our technology and\n\n43\n00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,546\nthe power that we have available.\n\n44\n00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:49,254\nWe can do a lot more than just\nrotate 13 letters, right?\n\n45\n00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,546\n[LAUGH]\n>> E, exactly.\n\n46\n00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,621\nWe, we've got a lot of\nthings on the table,\n\n47\n00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,322\nlot of things on the menu that we can use\nto actually encrypt and decrypt stuff,\n\n48\n00:02:56,322 --> 00:02:58,754\nso we're,\nwe're gonna take a look at all of that.\n\n49\n00:02:58,754 --> 00:02:59,504\n>> Good, good.\n\n50\n00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,004\nI'm excited.\n\n51\n00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,379\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n52\n00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:04,379\nSo you know, first of all, you know,\nwhy do we, why even have cryptography?\n\n53\n00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:05,337\nWhat, what's the whole point?\n\n54\n00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,379\nWhy do I need it?\n\n55\n00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,055\n>> Well, there's plenty of reasons\nwe could pull out on why you wanna\n\n56\n00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,446\nuse cryptography, but, you know,\nprobably the biggest reason is,\n\n57\n00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:17,254\nit's a, it's a good way of protecting\nthe confidentiality of information.\n\n58\n00:03:17,254 --> 00:03:22,129\nYou know, one of the, one of the key or\ncore things that we have in security.\n\n59\n00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:27,138\nYou know, if you wanna keep pry, you know,\nprying or curious eyes out of you know,\n\n60\n00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:30,715\nlooking at your business this\nis a great way to do it.\n\n61\n00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:35,710\nAs such, it's used in many of the areas\nthat we will be talking about, you know,\n\n62\n00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,587\nin the, in and around this whole course.\n\n63\n00:03:38,587 --> 00:03:41,213\n>> Yeah, we've mentioned that\nfirst episode, the, the CIA triad.\n\n64\n00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:43,137\nRight?\nConfidentiality, integrity and\n\n65\n00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:46,296\navailability, that first leg\nbeing that confidentiality.\n\n66\n00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:47,671\n>> Boom.\nRight there.\n\n67\n00:03:47,671 --> 00:03:51,837\nThat's a, that's a very, very important\narea where it play, where it plays a role.\n\n68\n00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:55,027\nYou know, so, and all and then you\nhave and so, you have a lot of, a,\n\n69\n00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:55,962\na, need to do that.\n\n70\n00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:56,712\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n71\n00:03:56,712 --> 00:04:01,153\n>> In fact, some of the tax we'll see\nlater on in this, in this course,\n\n72\n00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,833\nyou will see things like sniffing and\n\n73\n00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:08,026\nsession hijacking just to name,\njust to name a couple.\n\n74\n00:04:08,026 --> 00:04:11,504\nThose can be defeated by using\nthings such as cryptography.\n\n75\n00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,004\n>> All right.\n>> Yes.\n\n76\n00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:13,194\n>> And, and, and, you know,\n\n77\n00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:15,377\nas our technologies progress and,\nand, you know,\n\n78\n00:04:15,377 --> 00:04:17,087\nit use to be the secret to Coca-Cola.\n\n79\n00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:17,786\nRight?\nIt's kept\n\n80\n00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:21,491\nin a safe somewhere in some building and,\nand only if you knew that combination or\n\n81\n00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:25,379\ncould break that safe could you get in,\nbut now our data's stored electronically.\n\n82\n00:04:25,379 --> 00:04:27,705\nIt's, it's on these systems,\nit's on these networks and\n\n83\n00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:29,087\nall of our networks are connected.\n\n84\n00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:32,228\nAnd so with the right equipment and\nthe right skill set, you know,\n\n85\n00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:35,594\npeople can find their way in and\nthat cryptography's getting us that,\n\n86\n00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,129\nthat another layer of defense.\n\n87\n00:04:37,129 --> 00:04:40,127\nWe always talk about layers of defense and\nsecurity and,\n\n88\n00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:43,129\nand I think cryptology is just a,\nanother layer to that.\n\n89\n00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,129\n>> Absolutely.\n\n90\n00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:48,463\nIn fact, you could go as far to say,\nin a number of cases if we didn't have\n\n91\n00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:53,250\nthe technology do, to do en, encryption,\ndecryption and even hashing.\n\n92\n00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,007\nA lot of the technologies that\nwe have nowadays just wouldn't\n\n93\n00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:58,462\nexist in the same form.\n\n94\n00:04:58,462 --> 00:04:58,962\n>> Yeah, e-commerce.\n\n95\n00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:01,953\nI mean, I'm not gonna put my credit card\nnumber on some website if you can't tell\n\n96\n00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:04,462\nme that that information's gonna\nbe encrypted as it travels across\n\n97\n00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:05,046\nthe internet.\n\n98\n00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:07,017\nRight?\nSo, it just wouldn't exist,\n\n99\n00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:07,962\nonline banking.\n\n100\n00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:10,254\n>> Yeah, or at least it wouldn't\nexist in its, in its current form.\n\n101\n00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:10,837\n>> Yeah.\n\n102\n00:05:10,837 --> 00:05:13,337\n>> They would have had to find something,\nsome other way to do it.\n\n103\n00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:14,791\n>> All right.\n>> Which is you know,\n\n104\n00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,087\nwe don't really have\na great alternative to it.\n\n105\n00:05:17,087 --> 00:05:19,732\n>> Right. [LAUGH] >> You know,\ncryptography does the job so well and\n\n106\n00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:23,421\nit's been so versatile that we don't\nreally need to find another way to do it.\n\n107\n00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:26,264\n>> Right.\n>> So that's you know, kind of gives a,\n\n108\n00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:28,587\nat least one reason why it's used.\n\n109\n00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:31,629\nAnother reason why it's used\nis the integrity aspect.\n\n110\n00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:34,729\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which is, really, solely the domain of,\n\n111\n00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:35,629\nof hashing.\n\n112\n00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:38,148\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, hashing is used to verify,\n\n113\n00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:43,060\nto verify that, you know, whether or\nnot information has stayed the same or\n\n114\n00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,837\nit has been modified and\nwe're gonna see just how that works.\n\n115\n00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:50,202\nYou know, I've got some demos lined\nup here for you to show you that and\n\n116\n00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:52,350\nreally kinda get your eyeballs on it.\n\n117\n00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,306\nThe thing you wanna remember is that,\nwhy encryption and decryption are used\n\n118\n00:05:57,306 --> 00:06:02,046\nto protect confidentiality of information,\nhashing doesn't do that.\n\n119\n00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:05,421\nHashing does just integrity,\nyour information is still readable.\n\n120\n00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,911\n>> That's one of the things I think that\nif people really struggle with sometimes,\n\n121\n00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:12,558\nbecause we talk about hashing along with\nall the other encryption methodology and,\n\n122\n00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:14,171\nand it really does encrypt the data.\n\n123\n00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,395\nRight?\nYour data goes in,\n\n124\n00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:18,795\nit runs through this mathematical\nprocess and the output is a, a hash and\n\n125\n00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,379\nwe'll talk more about hashing.\n\n126\n00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,398\nBut you get your hash value or\nas, as a result, but\n\n127\n00:06:23,398 --> 00:06:26,041\nthe original data is still there and\nreadable.\n\n128\n00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,421\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n129\n00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:30,411\n>> So, it's not giving you anything for\nconfidentiality, but\n\n130\n00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:33,879\nchange one little character in there and,\nand I can tell immediately.\n\n131\n00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:35,046\n>> Exactly.\n\n132\n00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,961\nSo that's, that's,\nthat's the value of that and, and, and\n\n133\n00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,379\nwe're gonna see all this-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n134\n00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:42,815\n>> To kind of make sure that we really,\nyou know, again,\n\n135\n00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:47,921\nget our eyeballs out to see exactly what\nthat means to use one over the other.\n\n136\n00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:52,688\nNow there's two additional things that,\nthat that cryptography aids us in doing\n\n137\n00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:57,667\nand that is doing authentication just\nabout every authentication mechanism you\n\n138\n00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,837\nuse out there in some way, shape or\nform, employs cryptography.\n\n139\n00:07:01,837 --> 00:07:02,880\nNot all of them.\n\n140\n00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,171\nNot all of them, but a lot of them do.\n\n141\n00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:09,810\nAnd so that's an important thing and we're\ngonna see that when we start talking about\n\n142\n00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,629\ndigital signatures or you know,\nfor a, as one case of that.\n\n143\n00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:17,078\nAnd then we also have something\nthat's very important to us,\n\n144\n00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:20,691\ncryptography plays a role in\nwhat they call non-repudiation.\n\n145\n00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:25,689\nNon-repudiation is important, because it\nallows us to say to definitively say,\n\n146\n00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,254\nwho carried out an action.\n\n147\n00:07:27,254 --> 00:07:31,962\nAnd now most of us are familiar with\nthat in terms of digital signatures.\n\n148\n00:07:31,962 --> 00:07:36,764\nIf you digitally sign something it\nmeans that once you digitally sign it,\n\n149\n00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:41,587\nwe know by virtue of it being your digital\nsignature it came, it came from you.\n\n150\n00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,174\nYou know, so, if you say, well,\nI didn't send that, either you're lying or\n\n151\n00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:48,671\nsomeone got a hold of your signature and\nthen we've got a problem either way.\n\n152\n00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:49,254\n>> Absolutely.\n\n153\n00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:50,758\n>> You know, so that's, that, that,\n\n154\n00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:54,004\nthose are some of the important things to\nremember about what cryptography does.\n\n155\n00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:57,813\nCryptography doesn't just do one thing,\nit can do a multitude of things.\n\n156\n00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:01,214\n>> So we see that it gives us that, that\nconfidentiality that we're looking for.\n\n157\n00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,316\nIt gives us the integrity that we need.\n\n158\n00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,431\nAnd allow those to give us the non\nrepudiation, the tying of the originator\n\n159\n00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:11,300\nwith that data, and it gives us\nthe ability to, what was the last one?\n\n160\n00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:11,830\n>> Authenticate.\n\n161\n00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,640\n>> Authentication,\n\n162\n00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,940\nbig part of authentication is\ngonna be the cryptography as well.\n\n163\n00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,060\nSo, lots of uses for cryptography, and\n\n164\n00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,490\nas you said at the beginning of\nthe episode, it's not like this is new.\n\n165\n00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,670\nIt's been around,\nI think some of the books I've read say,\n\n166\n00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,080\nit's been around since man had secrets.\n\n167\n00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,190\nYou know, maybe even before the written\nword, and things like that.\n\n168\n00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:35,250\nSo, it's nothing new, it's just changed\nin the way we've implemented it\n\n169\n00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,496\nover the years, so,\nit's been around for awhile.\n\n170\n00:08:37,496 --> 00:08:43,325\n>> Yeah, there's actually been cases made\nsaying that since man started rendering\n\n171\n00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:49,420\nideas, even in cave paintings, that there\nwas a need for some form of cryptography.\n\n172\n00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,078\nTo write something that only, your group\nunderstand or your clan understood, and\n\n173\n00:08:54,078 --> 00:08:58,150\nif we go back far enough you'll say\nwhere the best hunting grounds were.\n\n174\n00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,680\nYou wanted your people to have\nthe advantage, not the other guy.\n\n175\n00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,985\n>> Right, all of a sudden somebody\nelse getting that information and\n\n176\n00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:03,899\ntaking all the good game.\n\n177\n00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,477\nAnd I think in your book you talk about\nthe, the Egyptians and the hieroglyphs and\n\n178\n00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,912\nhow you can almost look at\nthat as a form of encryption.\n\n179\n00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:13,001\nBecause if you're part of the royalty or\nthe upper echelon,\n\n180\n00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:17,001\nyou weren't taught to read those and\nthen you couldn't understand it, and so\n\n181\n00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:21,260\nonly if somebody would decipher or read it\nto you, would you get that information.\n\n182\n00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,410\nSo that is a form of cryptography,\ncuz we're keeping,\n\n183\n00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,800\nit's that confidentiality, right?\n\n184\n00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,990\nIf you can't decipher it, you can't\nread it, you don't have the information.\n\n185\n00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,530\n>> Exactly.\n\n186\n00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,910\n>> So, been around for a long time.\n\n187\n00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:32,743\n>> Long, long time.\n\n188\n00:09:32,743 --> 00:09:38,620\n>> [LAUGH] All right so\nwe've talked about why we need it.\n\n189\n00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,790\nWe've got the confidentiality, integrity,\nauthentication, non-repudiation.\n\n190\n00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,990\nWe know it's been around for\nas long as we can remember,\n\n191\n00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,030\nall the way back to the Egyptians and\nprior to that.\n\n192\n00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,140\nAnd so it's important that we understand\nthe different methods of cyber-hackers.\n\n193\n00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,525\nThere are several different ways we can\ngo about applying cryptography, right?\n\n194\n00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,470\n>> Yeah,\nthere's plenty of ways that you can do it.\n\n195\n00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,060\nTo kind of look at some of, to kind of\nmix it in with the historic uses and\n\n196\n00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,460\nthe applications that it had\nkinda shows you how it's evolved.\n\n197\n00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,940\nSo in the earliest stuff we have that\nwe still see in use today is stuff like\n\n198\n00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,480\nthe Caesar cipher, which is a simple\nsubstitution cipher, and we are going to,\n\n199\n00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,680\nyou know, I'm going to demo that for you,\nso just hold on if you haven't seen that.\n\n200\n00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,030\nI'm gonna give you a look at that one, so\n\n201\n00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:33,560\nthat one was used by Julius Caesar,\nthat's where it got its name.\n\n202\n00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,065\nWho also makes an interesting salad,\ntoo, just in case you're wondering.\n\n203\n00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:38,819\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but what Julius Caesar did, and\n\n204\n00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,191\nI'll just use the English language\nas an example of this because we\n\n205\n00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:48,162\ndon't know-\n>> [LAUGH] Latin's a little rusty.\n\n206\n00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:49,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> You guy's know it, right?\n\n207\n00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,376\nCome on.\nSo, but\n\n208\n00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:54,057\nwhat happened is when\nJulius Caesar used this,\n\n209\n00:10:54,057 --> 00:10:59,672\nhe just shifted his letters and\nhis messages threee spaces to the right,\n\n210\n00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:05,029\nand when someone got it they need to\nshift it three spaces to the left.\n\n211\n00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:09,043\nAnd that's how he sent messages to\nhis commanders in the field and so,\n\n212\n00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:13,860\nwe have an example there again of trying,\nof keeping information confidential.\n\n213\n00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860\nYou wouldn't want someone\nelse to have that.\n\n214\n00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,910\n>> So he knew there was a chance that\nthat messenger could be intercepted,\n\n215\n00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,340\nI mean his battle and things like that,\nbut if they got that message.\n\n216\n00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,470\nit just looks like gobbledygook.\n\n217\n00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,040\nThey have no idea what it\nsays because they would know\n\n218\n00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,600\nto shift it back three letters.\n\n219\n00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,355\n>> Exactly, and there's just a lot of\nthings that are reason why it worked well.\n\n220\n00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:33,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n221\n00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,470\n>> And they still use that to,\nthey definitely still use that today.\n\n222\n00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:43,395\nAnd you mentioned shifting 13 spaces.\n\n223\n00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:44,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Rot 13.\n\n224\n00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,070\n>> The Rot 13 yeah.\n\n225\n00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,700\n>> That's the substitution cipher, and\n\n226\n00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,795\nthat's in the same family\nas the Caesar cipher.\n\n227\n00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:50,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And\n\n228\n00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,840\nthat was used a lot on, early BBSes.\n\n229\n00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,920\nI don't know if you know that or not.\n\n230\n00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,496\n>> Oh, oh, yeah.\nYep.\n\n231\n00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,172\n>> They used it on early BBSes, and for\n\n232\n00:11:57,172 --> 00:12:01,290\nthose of you too young to know\nwhat a BBS is, look it up.\n\n233\n00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Before we had HTML, guys.\n\n234\n00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,285\n>> Yeah.\nGet off my lawn.\n\n235\n00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:09,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if you're, but, in the early days,\n\n236\n00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:14,560\nwhen they put stuff on BBSes,\nthere was one of the, if people posted,\n\n237\n00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,580\none of the big places they used, it was,\npeople posted like, dirty jokes and stuff.\n\n238\n00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,450\nThey put, they encrypt it using ROT 13,\nsaying they shifted every letter\n\n239\n00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,340\nthrough 13 spaces to the right, and\nthey figured okay, if you saw it and\n\n240\n00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,200\nsaw it was like that, and\nyou knew what the way to decode it,\n\n241\n00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,783\nand they figured if you decoded it,\nyou knew what you were getting into.\n\n242\n00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:36,740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, so\n\n243\n00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:41,771\nthat was one of the uses of it,\nnot the most glamorous use, I'll admit,\n\n244\n00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:46,160\nbut it was kind of an interesting\nlittle piece of trivia there.\n\n245\n00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,850\n>> Yeah, but it does,\n\n246\n00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,100\nwith the cryptography is really in\nevery aspect of what we do nowadays.\n\n247\n00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,740\nLike you were saying, so many different\nplaces we see it, and so many things that\n\n248\n00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,854\nwe just wouldn't have or wouldn't be the\nsame if we didn't have this technology.\n\n249\n00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:07,015\nIt's evolved tremendously,\nit's a fascinating thing to look at,\n\n250\n00:13:07,015 --> 00:13:12,115\nfrom the early days, like Caesar cipher,\nto the Civil War, to Beignet Cypher\n\n251\n00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,700\nto World War II, with the Enigma machine-\n>> The Enigma, yeah.\n\n252\n00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,905\n>> That the Germans used.\n\n253\n00:13:18,905 --> 00:13:20,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I mean, they're just, Germans and\n\n254\n00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,730\nJapanese, as a matter of fact.\n\n255\n00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,575\nAnd to today's environment.\n\n256\n00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:25,300\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We have,\n\n257\n00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,690\nyou know, a lot of really cool things\nthat we're doing in cryptography.\n\n258\n00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,490\nAnd then they're even talking next\ngeneration with cryptography, which is\n\n259\n00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:37,250\nquantum Cryptography, which is where\nthey're doing, they use quantum physics,\n\n260\n00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,820\nand something called quantum entanglement,\n>> Looking at the Q-bit, and\n\n261\n00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,860\nthe phase of the rotation of these things,\nor something.\n\n262\n00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,400\n>> Yeah, they're looking at subatomic\nparticles, and how they're linked,\n\n263\n00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,180\nI could explain it to you, but\nit's just not cool to do that, you know?\n\n264\n00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,260\nSo. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH] I started\nreading one of those white papers, and\n\n265\n00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,000\nI think part of my brain had an aneurysm,\njust, boom!\n\n266\n00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's very cool,\n\n267\n00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,445\ninteresting stuff, but it's not something\nthat you need to know, don't worry.\n\n268\n00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:04,055\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that would be really messed up.\n\n269\n00:14:04,055 --> 00:14:05,830\n>> [LAUGH] That would, that would.\n\n270\n00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,410\nAll right so\nyou know we know cryptography,\n\n271\n00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,010\nkind of what it is and\nsome of the historical uses for it, so\n\n272\n00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,500\nlet's start breaking down some of\nthe different types of cryptography.\n\n273\n00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,360\n>> Okay.\n\n274\n00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,950\nThis is great.\n\n275\n00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,700\nWhen you look at different\ntypes of cryptography,\n\n276\n00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,190\nthere's two major types that we need\nto talk about right off the bat.\n\n277\n00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:26,660\nAnd that's symmetric cryptography and\nasymmetric cryptography.\n\n278\n00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,825\nThose deal specifically with\nencrypting and decrypting information,\n\n279\n00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:40,055\nor what we call plain text to cipher text,\nand cipher text back to plain text.\n\n280\n00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:45,035\nPlain text is anything that hasn't gone\nthrough the meat grinder of encryption and\n\n281\n00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:50,015\ncipher, or plain text is what comes out,\nis what goes in,\n\n282\n00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,140\ncipher text is what comes out, you know.\n\n283\n00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,440\nSo that's what the two is and\nyou will see those terms used a lot.\n\n284\n00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,470\n>> Yeah,\nthose are really good terms to know.\n\n285\n00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,660\nSo again, just to reiterate that,\nyour plain text is human readable, right?\n\n286\n00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,820\nThat's the information\nthat I want to protect.\n\n287\n00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,520\nAnd in its current state,\nanybody can read it.\n\n288\n00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,250\nIf I run it through some encryption\nalgorithm, the output of that is gonna be\n\n289\n00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,230\nmy cipher text or my encoded text,\nwhich is not human readable.\n\n290\n00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:19,990\nAnd without the proper key or\ndekeying, or decrypting information,\n\n291\n00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,110\nyou're not going to be able to get\nthat original message back out.\n\n292\n00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,600\nSo plain text human readable, cipher text,\n\n293\n00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,610\nyou need some more information to\nbe able to access that information.\n\n294\n00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,160\n>> Exactly.\n\n295\n00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,720\nSo symmetric, and\nasymmetric are the two encryption and\n\n296\n00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,560\ndecryption types that convert plain\ntext into cipher text and back.\n\n297\n00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,980\nThen we have something called hashing.\n\n298\n00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,020\nAnd hashing is, as I mentioned before,\nhashing is another type of doing.\n\n299\n00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,600\nof applying the principles\nof cryptography.\n\n300\n00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,870\nExcept it deals in a different area.\n\n301\n00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,320\nYou know, so\nthose are your three main types.\n\n302\n00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,151\nUnderneath that,\nwe have things like substitution ciphers,\n\n303\n00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:02,693\ntransposition ciphers, and\nthen they even go through and\n\n304\n00:16:02,693 --> 00:16:06,998\nsometimes classify them as classic\nciphers and modern ciphers.\n\n305\n00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:11,741\nThe classic ciphers would be stuff\nlike your, it would be stuff like your\n\n306\n00:16:11,741 --> 00:16:18,139\nsymmetric Systems and modern ones would\nbe stuff like your asymmetrical ones too.\n\n307\n00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,322\nYou know, so, and\nthen we also have block and\n\n308\n00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:24,120\nstream which is how it deals with stuff\nunderneath the hood for the algorithm.\n\n309\n00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,070\nAll right, so let, let's start then\nwith some symmetric cryptography and\n\n310\n00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,300\nthe terms symmetric to me, and\nthe first thing that I think of Symmetric,\n\n311\n00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,460\nI think back to like biology, you know,\nand the same on both sides, or being able\n\n312\n00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,140\nto fold something in half, I have an exact\ncopy of it so, when we talk about\n\n313\n00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,900\ncryptography, and symmetric cryptography,\nwe're really talking about that key right.\n\n314\n00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,600\n>> Yes.\n\n315\n00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,580\nI, it's the,\nthe key is an important thing.\n\n316\n00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,430\nLet, let's, so let's talk about that.\n\n317\n00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,390\nFor the first let's,\n\n318\n00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,790\nlet's really discuss what a key-\n>> Okay, very good.\n\n319\n00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,370\n>> Actually is.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n320\n00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,410\n>> It's probably important to\n[LAUGH] to get, to get through.\n\n321\n00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,510\nSo you know, bef, let's,\nlet's back up a bit.\n\n322\n00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,485\nAnd kinda, and say so we know what\nplain text and cypher text is.\n\n323\n00:17:05,485 --> 00:17:06,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n324\n00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,240\n>> We got an algorithm\n>> 'Kay, an algorithm is a formula\n\n325\n00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,960\nthat describes, you know,\nhow encryption is, is gonna take place.\n\n326\n00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,250\nYou know, what the process is for\n\n327\n00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:21,040\ntransforming it from one format\nto another, and back if need be.\n\n328\n00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,160\nSo, that's,\nthat's the significance of that,\n\n329\n00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,170\nand there's a lot of ways you\ncan instruct an algorithm.\n\n330\n00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,100\n>> Hm.\n>> And algorithms,\n\n331\n00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,160\ninterestingly enough, are, probably aren't\nas complex as you think they might be.\n\n332\n00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,970\nYou know, people expect to see, you know,\nsome guy with some wild hair and\n\n333\n00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,850\na lab coat scribbling on a board,\nand it just doesn't work that way.\n\n334\n00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,120\n>> Right.\n>> You know, having a whole wall full of,\n\n335\n00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,060\nyou know, nu, numbers and\nblah, blah, blah back there.\n\n336\n00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,740\nThat's not efficient to use in a computer-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n337\n00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,940\n>> No matter how good your computer is,\n\n338\n00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,330\nit's just not that efficient.\n\n339\n00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,580\nSo we, you, you know, your,\nyour algorithms could be very, very,\n\n340\n00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,150\nvery short and insignificant.\n\n341\n00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,710\nYou could look at them and go, that's it?\n\n342\n00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,130\n>> That's what-\n>> You know, that's what baffling me?\n\n343\n00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,290\n>> That's what's protecting my data,\nreally?\n\n344\n00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:56,910\n>> Yeah.\n\n345\n00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,120\nYeah, it's, it's, it can be really,\n\n346\n00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,710\nreally, so, like really simple but\nthey are can be tremendously effective.\n\n347\n00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,170\n>> Right.\n>> You know, so the, so there's that.\n\n348\n00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,260\nAnd they got some really smart\npeople working on this stuff.\n\n349\n00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,875\nSo.\n\n350\n00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,550\n>> [LAUGH] But, but there's only so\nmany algorithms out there, right?\n\n351\n00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,150\n>> That, that, that we can use,\nand, and it, it's like.\n\n352\n00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,260\nThere's this, one of the things, you know,\n\n353\n00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,100\nwhen we're first getting into crypt,\ncryptography you find that, you know,\n\n354\n00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,850\nthere's, there's, there's several of them,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n355\n00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,250\nThere's a lot of algorithms out there,\nbut when it comes down to it, if,\n\n356\n00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,830\nif we're using the same algorithm,\nthe same formula To encrypt my data.\n\n357\n00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,680\nIf I know the formula you're using,\nor the algorithm that, you're,\n\n358\n00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,025\nyou're using, why can't I just\nreverse it and get your data back out?\n\n359\n00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:36,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n360\n00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,300\nThat, and, and that's the, that's\nthe thing is that you can understand how\n\n361\n00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,240\nan algorithm wor, algorithm works,\nin fact, there's something in cryptography\n\n362\n00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,230\ncalled Kerckhoffs' Principle-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n363\n00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,360\n>> Which says that you\ncan publish an algorithm\n\n364\n00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,310\n>> And scrutinize the whole thing, and\n\n365\n00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,150\nthat's a good idea.\n\n366\n00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,265\nIt's kind of like the same\nconcept as open source.\n\n367\n00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,550\n>> Um-hm.\n>> You know that it's a lot you\n\n368\n00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,130\ncan scrutinize if you want.\n\n369\n00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,310\nThe reality is,\nthese algorithms that're, that you can,\n\n370\n00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,632\nyou can look at, most of probably\naren't gonna get it you know.\n\n371\n00:19:03,632 --> 00:19:06,670\n[LAUGH] The reality is, you know,\nI can sit there and go, yeah,\n\n372\n00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,790\nI can see some stuff happening.\n\n373\n00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,230\nI don't know what's going on.\n\n374\n00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,130\nI just know it works.\n\n375\n00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,450\nThere's people a lot smarter\nthan me that can do that.\n\n376\n00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,540\nBut, I can look at the algorithm.\n\n377\n00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,550\nThe other thing that's,\nthat we have to keep in mind.\n\n378\n00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,000\nWhen we're talking about something\ncalled Kerckhoffs's principle,\n\n379\n00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,700\nwe can look at the algorithm, but\nwe can't we keep the key secret.\n\n380\n00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,910\nThe key is the important thing.\n\n381\n00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,030\nAn algorithm defines How many potential\ndoes a lot of things, one of the things it\n\n382\n00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,775\ndefines is the key space, saying how\nmany potential keys you can have.\n\n383\n00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:34,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n384\n00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,390\n>> And that could be huge,\nit's mind numbingly huge.\n\n385\n00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,530\nYou know, the human, the human\nbrain really only grasps numbers,\n\n386\n00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,350\naccurately grasps numbers up to about\n100 or 150, after that it's just,\n\n387\n00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,960\nit's just, it's blah, it's a,\nit's a bunch of stuff.\n\n388\n00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,920\nIf you talk about something like\nthe caesar cyphers applied to\n\n389\n00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,656\nthe English language,\nyou're talking twenty-seven possible keys.\n\n390\n00:19:56,656 --> 00:19:59,710\nCuz you've got 26 letters in\nthe alphabet so one through 26 and\n\n391\n00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,510\nthen you add zero cause you don't\nhave to do anything at all,\n\n392\n00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,210\nyou could leave it how you see it\nYou know so, 27 possible keys.\n\n393\n00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,290\nThat's not a big key space.\n\n394\n00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,700\nNow if you look at something like A-yes\n\n395\n00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,270\nthe common example just to\nkinda help us visualise it.\n\n396\n00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:19,170\nIs to say if you dug a trench from,\nlike Sacramento to Los Angeles, which\n\n397\n00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,710\nis about 450 miles, if you dug a trench\nthat long and made it a mile wide and\n\n398\n00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,130\na mile deep, and filled it full of ping\npong balls, and during this process,\n\n399\n00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,800\nyou took one ping pong ball, painted it\nred, and chucked it in there, you know,\n\n400\n00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:37,660\njust at random and said, that represents\nthe correct key to undo a lock,\n\n401\n00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,910\nyou know how long would it take you to\nfind or do a key spacers to find it?\n\n402\n00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,180\nStatistically, it could be\nthe first thing you find.\n\n403\n00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,570\n>> Right.\n>> So, statistically,\n\n404\n00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,680\nit could be the very last one you pull\nout of that trench after everything's all\n\n405\n00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,890\nsaid and done.\n\n406\n00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,900\nBut either way, you're gonna have to pack\na lunch, because it's gonna take a while.\n\n407\n00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,140\n>> Yes.\n>> You're probably gonna have to clear out\n\n408\n00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,350\nsome aspect of that tren, or some amount\nof that trench before you find it.\n\n409\n00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,200\nNow, if you were, were relying\non being able to get that key,\n\n410\n00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,490\nto get that information,\nbecause it was very important to you,\n\n411\n00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,260\nIt's probably not gonna be valuable\nto you by the time you find it.\n\n412\n00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,180\nYou know, case and point is, is the,\nis the enigma machine from World War II.\n\n413\n00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,740\nIt was able to be broken by the Allies,\n\n414\n00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,030\ncuz they found defects in the system and\nhad inside knowledge of it.\n\n415\n00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,170\nIf they use traditional brute force\nmethods, they found that, there's\n\n416\n00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,410\nmessages that the, on the, on one of the\nnego machines that had five reels in it.\n\n417\n00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,060\nThey were actually able to break it in\nabout 2004 using brute force techniques.\n\n418\n00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,460\n>> Huh.\n>> That was the piece of information you\n\n419\n00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,430\nwere relying on to win the war.\n\n420\n00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,976\nYou've got a problem.\n\n421\n00:21:35,976 --> 00:21:37,086\n>> [LAUGH] A little too late, isn't it?\n\n422\n00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:38,490\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's a little late.\n\n423\n00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,340\nYou know, we're not saying we're not\nsaying that algorithms are unbreakable.\n\n424\n00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,730\nWe're just saying it's gonna be\nit's gonna be tough to break.\n\n425\n00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,220\n>> And then so the larger\nthe key space on that algorithm,\n\n426\n00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,070\nthe more difficult it should be to,\nto break or the, potentially the longer.\n\n427\n00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,100\nLike you said, though, nothing to say\nthey get it on the first try, but\n\n428\n00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,100\nwe've got more possibilities Hopefully\nthe longer it's gonna take them to,\n\n429\n00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,090\nto crack or break that encryption.\n\n430\n00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,520\n>> Yep, exactly that's\nthe important thing to remember.\n\n431\n00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,120\nNow, once you know about that key when we\ncompare and contrast the two the two types\n\n432\n00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,330\nof crypto, of encryption technologies,\nit really is like you said the key.\n\n433\n00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,580\nYou know, you see something,\nyou hear about symmetric.\n\n434\n00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,000\nWhen you talk about\nsymmetric cryptography,\n\n435\n00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,510\nthe key that you use to encrypt is\nthe same key you use to decrypt.\n\n436\n00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,030\nIf we use the Caesar cypher for that,\nit's it's a great example because if\n\n437\n00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,810\nwe use three spaces to the right,\nwe do three spaces to the left.\n\n438\n00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:34,470\nIt's the exact same key,\nasymmetric isn't like that.\n\n439\n00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,860\nAsymmetric is kind of an odd ball.\n\n440\n00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,730\nAsymmetric relies on what's\nknown as a key pair.\n\n441\n00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,040\nSo, if you use one key\nto encrypt you have to\n\n442\n00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,270\nuse the other key in the pair to decrypt.\n\n443\n00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,200\nYou can use either one to do\neither operation, but whatever\n\n444\n00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,150\none you use to initiate the operation,\nyou can only reverse it with the other.\n\n445\n00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,120\n>> The other half of the key pair?\n\n446\n00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,000\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n447\n00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,190\n>> So, they're mathematically related.\n\n448\n00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,550\nThey're generated as a pair.\n\n449\n00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,370\nAnd one of the cool things\nabout these asymmetric keys is\n\n450\n00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,960\nif you have one of the keys, they'll\nsay it's mathematically impractical\n\n451\n00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,430\nthat you could determine\nwhat the other key was.\n\n452\n00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,940\nThey won't say it's impossibly but\nmathematically impractical.\n\n453\n00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,600\nAnd one of the things, and\nI don't know if this works for you.\n\n454\n00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:20,521\nOne of the ways I like\nto think of keys and\n\n455\n00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:25,084\nsometimes I'll teach\n\n456\n00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:29,405\nwith my students is,\n\n457\n00:23:29,405 --> 00:23:37,583\nif we're all using the same algorithm.\n\n458\n00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:45,339\ndoing, say, 13 If we're all So\n\n459\n00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:49,864\nI'm not rotating 13,\n\n460\n00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:54,174\nI'm actually rotating\n\n461\n00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:59,470\nwhat is that, 18 right?\n\n462\n00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,630\nBut your key might be minus ten.\n\n463\n00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,066\nSo you're actually only rotating three.\n\n464\n00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,593\nInstead of 13, right?\n\n465\n00:24:06,593 --> 00:24:08,959\nSo that way we can use\nthe same algorithms, but\n\n466\n00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,915\nif you don't know what my key is,\nyou really don't know what I used, right?\n\n467\n00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:15,957\nYou know I'm using rod 13, but\nyou didn't know it was a plus five.\n\n468\n00:24:15,957 --> 00:24:17,234\nOr a minus four.\n\n469\n00:24:17,234 --> 00:24:19,824\nSo I like to think of the key as a way to,\nto mod,\n\n470\n00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:24,310\nto tweak the algorithm a little bit\nto make it unique for your situation.\n\n471\n00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,690\nNow because you know like AES I mean\nits using all these systems and if,\n\n472\n00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,570\nif there wasn't a key to make it\ndifferent each time we did the encryption\n\n473\n00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,210\nthen it could get you encryption back out.\n\n474\n00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:34,810\n>> Exactly.\n>> So, that,\n\n475\n00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:38,640\nthat key is what makes it unique and\nwhat makes that encryption work.\n\n476\n00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,700\n>> Yeah it's exactly.\n\n477\n00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,100\nIt can be a very tricky process,\nbut it, it, it doesn't have to be.\n\n478\n00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,470\nSee look, the good thing about\nhere is it's one of those things\n\n479\n00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,160\nthat there's not math required for.\n\n480\n00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,185\n>> Right.\n>> We, we promise, it's not gonna hurt.\n\n481\n00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:50,749\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah,\n\n482\n00:24:50,749 --> 00:24:52,190\nthat was a simplistic explanation.\n\n483\n00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,230\nNow in real life land, keys are anywhere\nfrom 56 bits and 4,096 bits, right?\n\n484\n00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,050\nAnd try to predict what 4,096 ones and\nzeros, you know,\n\n485\n00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,260\nI'm sticking into that equation.\n\n486\n00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,290\n>> Yeah, it's, it's.\n\n487\n00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,773\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's gonna be very tough and\n\n488\n00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:06,310\nvery complex.\n\n489\n00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,844\n>> Yeah.\n\n490\n00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:09,614\nSo with symmetric then,\nback to, back to us,\n\n491\n00:25:09,614 --> 00:25:12,490\nkinda I got us derailed\nthere a little bit.\n\n492\n00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,965\nSo with our symmetric\nwe've got one key and\n\n493\n00:25:14,965 --> 00:25:19,295\nthat key is used with that algorithm\nto generate my ciphertext.\n\n494\n00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:22,135\nAnd then the key is used\nagain on the other end\n\n495\n00:25:22,135 --> 00:25:24,910\nto turn that ciphertext\nback into plain text.\n\n496\n00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,595\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n497\n00:25:25,595 --> 00:25:26,155\n>> So I like it.\n\n498\n00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:28,395\nI mean, that sounds simple, sounds easy.\n\n499\n00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:29,549\nIt's perfect, right, you know?\n\n500\n00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:30,868\n[SOUND] Just use that.\n\n501\n00:25:30,868 --> 00:25:35,315\n>> And, and, and if you look at\na symmetric cryptographic system.\n\n502\n00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:40,830\nEssentially every cryptographic system\nuntil the modern era was, was symmetric.\n\n503\n00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,490\nWa, was symmetric every system\nthat was used to encrypt data.\n\n504\n00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,760\nBecause it was just, it was just simple.\n\n505\n00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,354\n>> It was simple.\n>> It wasn't until about the 60s or\n\n506\n00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:53,637\n70s that asymmetric you know,\ncryptography came online.\n\n507\n00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,970\nBecause we now had the math and\nthe computers to be able to do it.\n\n508\n00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,720\n>> Right.\nYeah, there's a\n\n509\n00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,390\n>> Computers being the key thing to that.\n\n510\n00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,960\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely cuz this symmetric,\n\n511\n00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,920\nI always considered symmetric\nalgorithm as being lightweight.\n\n512\n00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,760\nNot a lot of processing\npower required to do them.\n\n513\n00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,530\nAnd but, you know,\n\n514\n00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,470\nback in the 60s, 70s, 80s,\nour systems weren't all that powerful.\n\n515\n00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,345\nSo that was really kinda limiting,\nin, in what we could do with that.\n\n516\n00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n517\n00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,500\n>> But, but symmetric encryption being\nlightweight, being relatively quick to do\n\n518\n00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,600\nthe encryption, you know, it's very good\nat doing bulk amounts of encryption.\n\n519\n00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,910\nIt does have some drawbacks,\nthough, doesn't it?\n\n520\n00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,750\n>> Yes, asymmetric does have,\ndoes have some draw, or, or or if you're.\n\n521\n00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,420\nWell, if you're talking\nsymmetric that has drawbacks,\n\n522\n00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,120\nyeah there are some drawbacks to it.\n\n523\n00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,865\nAnd I, and I'll really get into\nto those some more, in a bit.\n\n524\n00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:39,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n525\n00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,650\n>> And that's something that you\nneed to know, by the way, is symet,\n\n526\n00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,610\nas you need to be able to for the exam\nis you need to be able to compare and\n\n527\n00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,590\ncontrast what symmetric and\nasymmetric are.\n\n528\n00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,990\nSo we're gonna cover each one\nof those in more depth here.\n\n529\n00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:57,056\nBut really look for, you know,\nwhy symmetric is a good idea and\n\n530\n00:26:57,056 --> 00:26:59,226\nnot a good idea as the case may be.\n\n531\n00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:01,537\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And why asymmetric is good and\n\n532\n00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,450\nnot good as the case may be.\n\n533\n00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,530\nBecause they both have their areas\nthat they're really good at.\n\n534\n00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,055\nAnd they both have there areas\nthat they are really poor at.\n\n535\n00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:10,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you have to know,\n\n536\n00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,360\nyou definitely have to know that.\n\n537\n00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,920\nAnd you know it's symmetric for example,\nit excels on large volumes of data.\n\n538\n00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,830\nAnd if you think about it,\n\n539\n00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:26,715\nit's only doing simple simple\nyou know manipulations of data.\n\n540\n00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:31,940\nAsymmetric on the other hand it just\ntanks on large volumes of data it just,\n\n541\n00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,930\nit just you know,\ngoes downhill really quickly.\n\n542\n00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:38,850\nSo they, you can see that\nthere's one's good at one, and\n\n543\n00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,650\none's good at anot, and\none isn't so good at it.\n\n544\n00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,160\nSo we have to take those and, and have to\ntake those things into, into account or\n\n545\n00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,455\nwe're doing one over the other.\n\n546\n00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:49,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n547\n00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,260\nYeah, so we,\nwe get our symmetric being single key.\n\n548\n00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,550\nThe same key is used for the encryption\nis also used for the decryption.\n\n549\n00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,280\nAnd then we, with asymmetric then,\n\n550\n00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,030\nasymmetric meaning not\nthe same on both sides.\n\n551\n00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,505\nAnd I think you've already mentioned,\nwe've got two keys, right?\n\n552\n00:28:05,505 --> 00:28:07,105\nAnd, and as you said,\n\n553\n00:28:07,105 --> 00:28:11,965\ndoesn't matter which key, both keys\ncan be used to do the encryption.\n\n554\n00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,605\nWhichever key you use for the encryption,\n\n555\n00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:17,205\nthe other half of the key pair then\nhas to be used for the decryption.\n\n556\n00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:17,715\n>> Exactly.\n\n557\n00:28:19,117 --> 00:28:20,265\n>> All right,\nwell I tell you what ladies and\n\n558\n00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:23,115\ngentlemen, that is looking at the clock,\nthat's a really good place for\n\n559\n00:28:23,115 --> 00:28:24,390\nus to take our break.\n\n560\n00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,160\nSo we're going to stop here,\n\n561\n00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,390\nwhen we come back we're going to\ndive further into cryptography.\n\n562\n00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,620\nAnd take a closer look at some of\nthe key difference between symmetric and\n\n563\n00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,960\nasymmetric and what their weaknesses\nare and what their strengths are.\n\n564\n00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,340\nSo we know when to use or\nwhen not to use a particular algorithm.\n\n565\n00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,570\nAnd then we'll get into some hashing and\nsome more cryptography coming up.\n\n566\n00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,188\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n567\n00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:50,948\n[MUSIC]\n\n568\n00:28:50,948 --> 00:28:52,740\nAll right welcome back ladies and\n\n569\n00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,380\ngentlemen, we're continuing on with\nour discussion on cryptography.\n\n570\n00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,140\nSo we left off Shawn talking about\nsome of the differences between\n\n571\n00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,250\nsymmetric encryption and\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n572\n00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,720\nSo where do you want to go next?\n\n573\n00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,730\n>> Well, let's, let's kinda,\nlet's flesh out the topics a bit more.\n\n574\n00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,574\n>> Okay.\n>> I think that's what we need to do.\n\n575\n00:29:09,574 --> 00:29:12,376\nSo let's talk about things\nthat are symmetric.\n\n576\n00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:17,482\nAnd then, I am going to do some demos of,\nsome demos to show you just kinda what\n\n577\n00:29:17,482 --> 00:29:22,615\nthey look like, and maybe help you get\nyour head, around the whole process.\n\n578\n00:29:22,615 --> 00:29:27,500\nCuz I think that really, really helps on a\nconceptual, to understand these concepts.\n\n579\n00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,800\nTo take that conceptual\nto a practical standing.\n\n580\n00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,492\n>> Okay.\n>> So symmetric as we said in the, in,\n\n581\n00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:35,501\nin the previous discussion,\n\n582\n00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:39,891\nis a, is a form of encryption that uses\nthe same key to encrypt and decrypt.\n\n583\n00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:46,460\nYou just choose the key that's,\nthat's allowable by the algorithm's rules.\n\n584\n00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,720\n>> And once you have that you\nuse it to perform the process.\n\n585\n00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:55,680\nNow once you once, once you have that,\nyou go ahead and do your whole thing.\n\n586\n00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,550\nNow you've got if they encrypted or\ndecrypted as the case may be.\n\n587\n00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,230\nBut there are some problems there.\n\n588\n00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,010\nThe, the, that system is very simple.\n\n589\n00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,235\nVery, very simple,\nwhich sounds like a great thing.\n\n590\n00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:07,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It is a great thing, but\n\n591\n00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,170\ndepends on how you look at it, okay?\n\n592\n00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:12,800\nThe great things about\nsymmetric are that it\n\n593\n00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,280\nworks very fast on large volumes of data.\n\n594\n00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,805\nSo that's a big plus.\n\n595\n00:30:16,805 --> 00:30:17,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n596\n00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:23,140\n>> But then you have you know,\nsome issues such as key distribution.\n\n597\n00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,820\n>> Mm.\n\n598\n00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,660\n>> Key distribution is a, is a big,\nbig, big problem with symmetric.\n\n599\n00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,730\nWhat you have to do Is you have to,\n\n600\n00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,770\nif you encrypt something with a,\nwith an a, with a symmetric algorithm and\n\n601\n00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:41,040\nyou distribute that, you need to figure\nout a way to get the key to someone.\n\n602\n00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,980\nBecause you're telling them hey here's the\nencrypted chunk of data, the cipher text,\n\n603\n00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,230\nand here's the algorithm I used to do\nthat, cuz they have to know what you used.\n\n604\n00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,720\nBut then you gotta tell\nthem what the specific\n\n605\n00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,569\nkey is that they're gonna\nuse to reverse your process.\n\n606\n00:30:55,569 --> 00:30:59,290\n>> So if somebody stole my\ndata during that distribution,\n\n607\n00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,700\nthen I gotta transmit\nthe key somehow to them.\n\n608\n00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,250\nAnd if somebody stole the key, since it's\nthe same key, so decrypted is encrypted,\n\n609\n00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,840\nthat means they could\ndecrypt my data as well.\n\n610\n00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,140\n>> Exactly.\n\n611\n00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,670\nAnd, and on another level, think about it.\n\n612\n00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:16,790\nIf someone gave you a key, if I\nenrolled you in a symmetric system and\n\n613\n00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,050\nissued you a key, and\nsomeone intercepted that.\n\n614\n00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,860\nNot only could they decrypt your data,\n\n615\n00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:27,470\nif I issued that key to you, they could\nalso encrypt data and look like you to me.\n\n616\n00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,720\nSo we don't have a way of doing,\nnon-repediation.\n\n617\n00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720\n>> It becomes an issue.\n\n618\n00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,860\n>> Yeah, it's a big, big issue, so\n\n619\n00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,270\nwe have to have a key management\nsolution to make this work.\n\n620\n00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:43,030\nSo, it means that,\nif this case is symmetric,\n\n621\n00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:47,400\nI have to transport the encrypted\ndata with the algorithm to you.\n\n622\n00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,930\nAnd then,\nI need to find what they call and\n\n623\n00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,610\nout of band distribution\nmechanism to get that key to you.\n\n624\n00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:56,250\nAnd all that means is that\nif I email the data to you,\n\n625\n00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,880\nI call you on the phone and, and\nrecite the key that way over to you.\n\n626\n00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,209\nSo, the-\n>> Cuz the,\n\n627\n00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:05,006\nthe logic there is that if they were able\nto intercept the email to get the data.\n\n628\n00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,956\nAnd I try to send the keys\nin that same channel,\n\n629\n00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,458\nthen they're most likely gonna\nintercept the key as well.\n\n630\n00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,638\n>> Yes.\n>> But if I send the data via email, but\n\n631\n00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:15,646\nthen I call you on the phone to give you\nthe key Hoping that maybe they don't have\n\n632\n00:32:15,646 --> 00:32:18,229\naccess to both of those\ncommunication channels.\n\n633\n00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:21,980\n>> Yes, they'd have to compromise both or\nhave access to both, and that,\n\n634\n00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,710\nthat makes it a lot\nsafer to do it that way.\n\n635\n00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,246\nBut, you can imagine the problems\nthat would cause them.\n\n636\n00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,135\n>> Not very convenient, is it?\n\n637\n00:32:28,135 --> 00:32:29,385\n>> No, not at all.\n\n638\n00:32:29,385 --> 00:32:33,285\nAnd definitely not at all, You'd have\nto figure out a way to, if I mean,\n\n639\n00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,435\nif it was just you and me distributing\nthe key, no, not, not a tremendous thing.\n\n640\n00:32:37,435 --> 00:32:41,075\nBut if I included you, me, plus everyone\nin this office that needs to have their\n\n641\n00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:44,865\nown unique key, then I have to not\nonly create those unique keys and\n\n642\n00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:46,505\nthen distribute those\nkeys to everyone else,\n\n643\n00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:48,800\nbecause I need to be\nable to crypt your stuff.\n\n644\n00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,720\nSo I need to have that identical key and\nthen it's now scout's honor if someone\n\n645\n00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,630\ndoesn't use some else's key to,\nto impersonate them.\n\n646\n00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:59,900\nIt's just a big problem, which is what\nthe, one of the big issues we have with,\n\n647\n00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,450\nwith symmetric systems.\n\n648\n00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,330\nSo there, there,\nwe gotta find a way to solve that.\n\n649\n00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,000\nUnfortunately symmetric doesn't have\na way to solve it in it, in of itself.\n\n650\n00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,660\nYou need to find another way outside of,\nof symmetric to solve that issue.\n\n651\n00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,510\nAnd we have yet to talk about that.\n\n652\n00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,370\nBut we will talk about what that is.\n\n653\n00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,520\nWe'll leave for another lesson.\n\n654\n00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:28,160\nSo, what I think, you know, kind of\nhelps here is to take a look at what,\n\n655\n00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,780\nat what a symmetric cipher looks like.\n\n656\n00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:36,530\nAnd what I'm gonna use here is,\nI have on my computer I have a website.\n\n657\n00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,360\nThat I'm going to use to demo this.\n\n658\n00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,860\nThis website is called, the, it's,\nyou can Google this, this is,\n\n659\n00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,740\nyou Google the name Simon Singh,\nS-I-N-G-H, and the words Black Chamber,\n\n660\n00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,418\nand it, he'll, he has this page that\nshows different encryption technologies.\n\n661\n00:33:55,418 --> 00:33:55,982\nAnd he,\n\n662\n00:33:55,982 --> 00:34:00,305\nit, it's all done in basic JavaScript To\nillustrate how these things work.\n\n663\n00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:04,240\n>> Nice.\n>> So what I've seen here is I am seeing,\n\n664\n00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,040\non, on the screen I'm seeing\nan example of the Caesar cipher.\n\n665\n00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,510\nNow to really, truly be the Caesar cipher,\nwe have to use a key shift of three.\n\n666\n00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,390\nYou can see the default up here is 18,\nso that just isn't gonna work.\n\n667\n00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,930\nWe want to do this, we really,\ntruly want to do the Caesar cipher.\n\n668\n00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:21,750\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm\ngonna do this offset, and\n\n669\n00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,050\nremember another word for offset is, key.\n\n670\n00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:27,070\n>> Key, okay.\n>> So, we're going to go ahead and\n\n671\n00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,420\nwe're going to put that in there and\n\n672\n00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,795\nI'm going to click down here and you can\nsee the, the letters actually updated.\n\n673\n00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:32,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n674\n00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:33,066\n>> I can have my plain text alphabet.\n\n675\n00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:34,041\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> D becomes an E.\n\n676\n00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,241\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n677\n00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:42,580\nYou now have your, your, your formula for\nmoving between, you know, two.\n\n678\n00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,960\nYou can, you very quickly saw you\ndidn't even have to explain it right.\n\n679\n00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,048\n>> Huh yeah.\n>> You know,\n\n680\n00:34:46,048 --> 00:34:50,521\nit's just went 3CA goes to D and, and,\nyou know, and so on and so forth.\n\n681\n00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So if we want to see that in use\n\n682\n00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,510\nall we have to do is go over\nhere to our plain text section.\n\n683\n00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,330\nAnd I could type in something like,\nhello world.\n\n684\n00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,515\nJust to keep it simple.\n\n685\n00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:03,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, type in hello world and\n\n686\n00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,280\nthey give you a nice button here\nthat says in cipher plaintext.\n\n687\n00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,070\nI click on that.\n\n688\n00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,625\nAnd you can see, it comes up with\nsomething down at the bottom.\n\n689\n00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:11,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n690\n00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,150\n>> It comes up with, instead of hello\nworld, it comes up with K-H-O-O-R.\n\n691\n00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,320\nAnd then Z-R-U, O-G.\n\n692\n00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,085\nSo, unrecognizable as far as, you know,\n\n693\n00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,260\ndefinitely doesn't say\n\"Hello world\" Anymore.\n\n694\n00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,160\n>> Doesn't say it anymore.\n\n695\n00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,700\n>> But, I do notice that it, you know,\nthe same number of letters in the output,\n\n696\n00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,100\nsame space in there between the words\n>> Yes.\n\n697\n00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,910\nYes.\nYou,\n\n698\n00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:35,690\nthat's, that's definitely\na good point to bring up.\n\n699\n00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:38,770\nThis also kinda, builds into\nsomething that was talked about, I,\n\n700\n00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,390\nI talked about it a little earlier,\nwas a stream cipher, if you recall?\n\n701\n00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:42,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n702\n00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,760\n>> A stream cipher,\nwhich this definitely is.\n\n703\n00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,379\n>> Mm.\nA stream cipher operates on a bit by bit\n\n704\n00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:53,191\nlevel and one of the drawbacks of it is is\nthat it operates on a bit by bit level,\n\n705\n00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:56,817\nwhat goes in is gonna be the same\nsize on the other side and so\n\n706\n00:35:56,817 --> 00:36:02,147\nwhat we're seeing here is that you may not\nknow what that message is underneath that,\n\n707\n00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:05,213\nbut you do know how long\nthe message actually is.\n\n708\n00:36:05,213 --> 00:36:07,216\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that's already got you to,\n\n709\n00:36:07,216 --> 00:36:11,470\nthat's already got you some, you know,\ndone some of the leg work for you.\n\n710\n00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,520\n>> If you were trying to break this, then\nyou, you got a piece of the puzzle there.\n\n711\n00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,470\n>> Yeah, and\nyou can also start to see some, the,\n\n712\n00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,570\nthe beginnings of something I'm gonna,\nthat I'm gonna expand upon more\n\n713\n00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,752\nlater on in, in, in this, in,\nin, this section on cryptography.\n\n714\n00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,259\nIf you notice in here and you look at,\nwhen you look at Hello World, and\n\n715\n00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:34,266\nyou look at the cipher text, you know,\nnotice that you see that you see how,\n\n716\n00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,130\nthe letters, the letters down there.\n\n717\n00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:38,000\nLook at how often some\nof the letters appear.\n\n718\n00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,540\n>> Right.\n>> When your looking at the cipher text..\n\n719\n00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,485\n>> I see that there's a particular letter\nthat shows, if I didn't have the plain\n\n720\n00:36:42,485 --> 00:36:46,090\ntext, I could see just from the cipher\ntext, something is in there three times.\n\n721\n00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,151\n>> Yes.\n>> All right.\n\n722\n00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:51,014\n>> So, yeah, if you know, if you know\nthat that's, that's the Caesar cipher,\n\n723\n00:36:51,014 --> 00:36:54,763\nyou can look at that and say well I don't\nknow what that letter is exactly, but\n\n724\n00:36:54,763 --> 00:36:56,685\nyeah I know it's in there three times.\n\n725\n00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:57,324\n>> Right.\n\n726\n00:36:57,324 --> 00:37:01,932\n>> And the thing is that there is a such\nthing as an attack on cryptography\n\n727\n00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:07,320\ncalled frequency analysis and\nevery language is, is vulnerable to this.\n\n728\n00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,620\nIs if you look at this, if you look\nat a language, you can tell how\n\n729\n00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:14,540\noften certain words, phrases, and\ncharacters appear in each language, and\n\n730\n00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,440\nthey actually have that for really,\njust about every language out there.\n\n731\n00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,390\nThe English language,\nif you look at it, you know,\n\n732\n00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,725\nyou have things like the letter R,\nand S and E.\n\n733\n00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,155\nThey all appear within a certain decibel.\n\n734\n00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:26,278\n>> It makes me think of,\nwhat was that Jeopardy.\n\n735\n00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,904\nYou know, they give you the R,\nS, T, L and E.\n\n736\n00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:28,774\n>> Wheel of Fortune.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n737\n00:37:28,774 --> 00:37:29,331\n>> Wheel of Fortune, yeah.\n\n738\n00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,694\n[LAUGH]\n>> That,\n\n739\n00:37:30,694 --> 00:37:32,835\nthat's one that

know,\n\n747\n00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:46,170\nI think Sajak will kick you\noff the show if you do that.\n\n748\n00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,670\nYou know, so but in any case, yeah we're\nseeing that we've, we've, this, this,\n\n749\n00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,490\nthis is the this is the Caesar cipher and\nyou know,\n\n750\n00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:56,430\nwhat that, what that specifically\ndoes you know, for us.\n\n751\n00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,950\nYou can see very quickly it's\na simple substitution cipher.\n\n752\n00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,800\nThis goes to this.\n\n753\n00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,420\nNow, I want, I, wa, it's a s, symmetric\ncipher, but it's also substitution.\n\n754\n00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,205\nSubstitute something for something else.\n\n755\n00:38:07,205 --> 00:38:07,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n756\n00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,450\n>> Okay.\nBut I wanna expand on this a bit.\n\n757\n00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,900\nYou know, Caesar ciphers aren't\nthe only ones that you can use,\n\n758\n00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,180\nthere's also something out\nhere called the Pigpen cipher.\n\n759\n00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:22,620\nThe pigpen cipher is, is, is a great\nexample of another great example of a,\n\n760\n00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,060\nof a, symmetr, or a, sorry,\na substitution cipher.\n\n761\n00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,970\nNow you substitute characters.\n\n762\n00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,500\nSo I go to my, our internet tools.\n\n763\n00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,770\n>> A little slow, a little bit.\n\n764\n00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,400\n>>

off.\n\n767\n00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,115\n>> Yeah, get off Netflix.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n768\n00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:37,615\n>> Yeah.\n\n769\n00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:38,115\n>> Come on.\n\n770\n00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:38,625\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n771\n00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,012\n>> [LAUGH] You know torrenting's\n\n772\n00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:41,856\nwrong people.\n>>

--> 00:38:51,969\nlooks like it's a little slow today.\nSo.\n\n780\n00:38:51,969 --> 00:38:52,980\n>> Locked up. All right. >> All right.\n\n781\n00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,010\n>> So you know, I haven't heard of the,\nthe pigpen cipher, so\n\n782\n00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:57,320\nit's another substitution

of seen the pigpen cipher,\n\n785\n00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:05,895\njust may not have called it that.\n\n786\n00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:07,599\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> It's also called the Freemason cipher.\n\n787\n00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,397\n>> Okay.\n\n788\n00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:12,303\n>> But what it is, is that you may have\nseen this you know, this situation\n\n789\n00:39:12,303 -->

something that we see on the\nback of cereal boxes and stuff like that.\n\n792\n00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:22,880\n>> Huh.\n>> It's a little puzzle for kids.\n\n793\n00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,440\nBut what they'll do is they'll write,\nyou know?\n\n794\n00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:27,970\nFor example, you know, if you kind of\nhave a vision, you've got a tic-tac-toe.\n\n795\n00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,400\nThe little, little symbol and\nthen you have A, B, C, D.\n\n796\n00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,290\nYou know, A, B, C, and then D, E, F going\nright through there, once you do that,\n\n797\n00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,694\nyou write, you write that a couple times.\n\n798\n00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,475\nOne has just, one has the letters in it,\nthen the next nine letters are done\n\n799\n00:39:41,475 --> 00:39:44,210\nin the same thing, but\nthey put dots in each one with the letter.\n\n800\n00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:45,805\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you know it's this one and\n\n801\n00:39:45,805 --> 00:39:46,410\nnot this one.\n\n802\n00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,165\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n803\n00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:50,245\n>> And they do, and what they do is\nthey write the message by saying,\n\n804\n00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:52,090\nokay you pick the letter A.\n\n805\n00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,240\nIf you pick the letters A in your message,\nyou just right that corner.\n\n806\n00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,100\nDon't right the letter A,\njust the write that corner of the symbol.\n\n807\n00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,486\nSo you'd have, you know, that popping up.\n\n808\n00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:02,148\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And then you just do that for\n\n809\n00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:03,049\nevery letter.\n\n810\n00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:04,124\n>> I see what you're saying.\n\n811\n00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:06,517\n>> So you're substituting, and\nnow it's come up on my screen here,\n\n812\n00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,994\nI think you can get a better look at it,\nwhat I'm talking about here,\n\n813\n00:40:08,994 --> 00:40:11,069\nif you see up top,\nthat's what I'm trying to describe.\n\n814\n00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:12,497\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n815\n00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:16,106\n>> You know, that's probably a little\nbetter than what, than what I was, doing.\n\n816\n00:40:16,106 --> 00:40:19,345\nSo if you're doing a J, then it would be\nthat backwards L with a dot in the corner.\n\n817\n00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:19,983\n>> Exactly.\n\n818\n00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:21,340\n>> Okay.\n\n819\n00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,840\n>> And so it's, it's, it's simple.\n\n820\n00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,470\nYou just, your plain text is just what,\nyou, you write it out, and then\n\n821\n00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:33,070\nyou just substitute that by, that shape of\nthat box in there, and send it somebody.\n\n822\n00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,589\nThis is probably something, like I said,\nthis is probably something that you've\n\n823\n00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,420\nseen in kid's puzzle books, and\ncereal boxes, stuff like that.\n\n824\n00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,036\n>> Yeah, like the menu places, the place\nmats at some restaurants where you can\n\n825\n00:40:42,036 --> 00:40:43,900\ncolor and draw,\nyou've got stuff like that on there.\n\n826\n00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,200\n>> Yeah.\nIt's a simple thing.\n\n827\n00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,027\nThat was actually at one point\nconsidered to be, in the middle ages,\n\n828\n00:40:48,027 --> 00:40:50,006\nconsidered to be a good\ncryptographic system.\n\n829\n00:40:50,006 -->

problem,\n\n844\n00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:20,860\nI shot the toaster last night, cuz it\nwas trying to so, anyway, that's what a,\n\n845\n00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,840\nthat's what a, that's what another form\nof substitution cipher looks like.\n\n846\n00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,713\nSo, just so you kind of know,\nit is symmetric, you know, but it's, but\n\n847\n00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:32,730\nit's something we call\nin substitution cipher.\n\n848\n00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,320\nSo, really, kind of great example,\nyou know of the two.\n\n849\n00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,820\nNow something else I wanna kinda,\ndemonstrate here is I kinda want to show\n\n850\n00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,730\nyou how we, you know, how we come up with\nan algorithm, how that actually looks.\n\n851\n00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:49,912\nAnd what I'm gonna do is since we've\nbeen spending some time talking about,\n\n852\n00:41:49,912 --> 00:41:55,060\nthe Caesar, cipher, what I want to do is,\nI want to use that as my,\n\n853\n00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,100\nas my example, and show you what\nan algorithm, show you how things relate.\n\n854\n00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,590\nYou know, so what I'm gonna do is,\nI am gonna bring up my,\n\n855\n00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,620\nwhite board here, and, on my white board,\nI am going to, you know,\n\n856\n00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:12,160\nshow you, you know, and show you\nwhat an algorithm would look like.\n\n857\n00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,950\nSo we already know,\nyou know what the Caesar cipher does it-.\n\n858\n00:42:14,950 -->

--> 00:44:09,710\nC over here\n>> It's all good,\n\n905\n00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,380\nit's all good I think we\nsee what you're saying.\n\n906\n00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:14,940\nSo yeah, if you reverse it obviously if\nyou take your cipher text and you take out\n\n907\n00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,440\nyour offset then you're left with your\nplain text or the original letter.\n\n908\n00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,990\n>> Exactly.\n>> I like it.\n\n909\n00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,800\nAnd, and, and see that should help you\nvisualize what an algorithm, you know,\n\n910\n00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,960\nlooks like.\n\n911\n00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,090\nIt's very, it's very, very simple when\nyou think about it in those terms.\n\n912\n00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,870\nWhat I would,\nwhat I would encourage you to do,\n\n913\n00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:37,160\nif you're still kind of a little fuzzy on\non encry, on encryption decryption and\n\n914\n00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,538\nalgorithms and all that remember this,\nremember the Caesar cipher.\n\n915\n00:44:41,538 --> 00:44:45,400\nThe Caesar cipher you know,\nillustrates a lot of the things, that,\n\n916\n00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,730\nyou know, it illustrates a lot of things\nthat we, that, that we have in, in,\n\n917\n00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,550\nin the encryption field,\nin symmetric at least.\n\n918\n00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:56,100\nYou can see that right there and\nbe like okay, now I get it.\n\n919\n00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,860\nAll the stuff you have here\napplies to all symmetric ciphers.\n\n920\n00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,724\n>> Nice.\n\n921\n00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:00,967\nI like it.\n\n922\n00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:02,429\nI like it.\n\n923\n00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,986\nAnd you are definitely an artist.\n\n924\n00:45:03,986 --> 00:45:04,589\n>> I know.\n\n925\n00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:07,543\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> If your, if your encryption knowledge\n\n926\n00:45:07,543 --> 00:45:12,535\nis as fuzzy as my drawing, then,\nyou need to, you need to stop right now.\n\n927\n00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:15,763\n>> [LAUGH] I love it.\n\n928\n00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:18,475\nI love it.\nSo, yeah, symmetrics, I guess we want to\n\n929\n00:45:18,475 --> 00:45:22,740\nrehash symmetrics, the big thing is\nit's the same key on both sides.\n\n930\n00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:25,920\nRight, the one key that whatever key\nyou use with the algorithm to do\n\n931\n00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,400\nthe encryption the other, the other half\nto decrypt it has to use that same key.\n\n932\n00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,340\nAnd it's definitely got its strong suits\nand still has its uses out there today.\n\n933\n00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,930\nIt's very fast, it's very light weight,\nit doesn't take a lot of processing power.\n\n934\n00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,370\nSo, it's really good doing\nthe bulk amounts of data.\n\n935\n00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:43,530\nIf you got to encrypt\na lot of information,\n\n936\n00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:47,510\nsymmetric algorithms are pretty quick,\ndoesn't take a lot of processing power.\n\n937\n00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:51,370\nThe downsides that we've discussed is\ngoing to be the key distribution part.\n\n938\n00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,150\nBecause if I'm going to use the same key\nto decrypt the information, then wherever\n\n939\n00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,200\nI distribute that encrypted information,\nI also have to distribute the key so\n\n940\n00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,280\nthat they can decrypt and\nget that orignal information back out.\n\n941\n00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,770\nAnd if there's a bad guy intercepting\nthat data, then there very well could be,\n\n942\n00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:08,770\nhe could be intercepting that key as well.\n\n943\n00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,600\nWhich means my,\nmy confidentiality has become compromised.\n\n944\n00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,080\nSo we, we've gotta, we're gonna end up,\nand Sean has said earlier,\n\n945\n00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,870\nhe's indicated that there\nare things that we can do\n\n946\n00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,230\nalong with symmetric encryption\nalgorithms to help improve that.\n\n947\n00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:24,710\nAnd try to take care of that\ndownside of that problem, that,\n\n948\n00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:29,520\nthat weakness that that\nsymmetric encryption has.\n\n949\n00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,580\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n950\n00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:33,440\nAnd something else that really\nneeds to fit into this whole\n\n951\n00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,345\nprocess is when we're talking about\nsymmetric, we need to talk algorithms.\n\n952\n00:46:37,345 --> 00:46:38,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, the,\n\n953\n00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,350\nwe definitely need to talk algorithms.\n\n954\n00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,320\nAlgorithms that we have for symmetric.\n\n955\n00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,705\n>> Mm.\n>> Some of the big guys.\n\n956\n00:46:44,705 --> 00:46:47,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Aes, advanced encryption standard.\n\n957\n00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,400\nAlso known as

so.\n\n981\n00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,960\nYou know, you, so you've got AES and\n\n982\n00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,480\ntriple DES are very\ncommonly seen nowadays.\n\n983\n00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,010\n>> So in the exam they could ask us,\nwhat's an example of?\n\n984\n00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,570\nOr here's a list of encryption algorithms.\n\n985\n00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,290\nWhich ones of these are symmetric?\n\n986\n00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,330\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n987\n00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:42,600\nAnd, and I, I would be prepared for\nthe exam, be prepared for\n\n988\n00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,470\nthem to ask questions on,\nyou know, which one of this,\n\n989\n00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:51,690\nwhich one of the ones on this list are are\nsymmetric, or which ones are asymmetric.\n\n990\n00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,530\nYou know, which one of these\n\n991\n00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,030\nones is not like the other-\n>> Right.\n\n992\n00:47:54,030 -->

00:48:01,725\nsymmetric, asymmetric, and hashing.\n\n995\n00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:05,375\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So what I would tell you for homework.\n\n996\n00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,840\n>> Mm-hm [LAUGH]\n>> If I was gonna put it that way, for\n\n997\n00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,500\nhomework is, you should probably\nmake a flashcard with that.\n\n998\n00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,852\nThat's the way I always\nrecommend studying.\n\n999\n00:48:11,852 --> 00:48:14,170\n>> Yeah.\n>> Make a flashcard and put the different,\n\n1000\n00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,118\nand put you know symmetric,\nasymmetric, and hashing on there.\n\n1001\n00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:22,541\nList out the algorithms and memorize those\nalgorithms No key lengths, you know,\n\n1002\n00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:25,359\nwhen you talk about key\nlengths keys can be you know,\n\n1003\n00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,880\n56 bit like you said\nall the way up to 496.\n\n1004\n00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:32,360\nNow you're not going to get 496 bit\nones on the EC-Council Exam, but\n\n1005\n00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:35,000\nyou will see those in the real world.\n\n1006\n00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,160\nKey length does impact how strong that,\nthat key will actually be.\n\n1007\n00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,820\nI guess it's one factor.\n\n1008\n00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,660\n>> And the algorithm is what determines\nwhat possible key lengths I can use.\n\n1009\n00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,170\nSo it's important that we know that we\nlook at AES, that we know whether or\n\n1010\n00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,990\nnot it's a symmetric or asymmetric, and\n\n1011\n00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,890\nwhat possible key lengths they\ncan use with that algorithm.\n\n1012\n00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,520\n>> Yes.\nAll those things are hard coded into\n\n1013\n00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:02,130\nthe algorithm and defined,\nexactly what you can and cannot use.\n\n1014\n00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:04,610\nThere are rules, and that's really\nwhat you can look at an algorithm, is,\n\n1015\n00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:09,600\nit imposes rules on you know what can and\ncan not be done.\n\n1016\n00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,700\nYou know, so\nit's just your choice to use what out of\n\n1017\n00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,620\nthat key space as they call it and\nuse that for your encryption process.\n\n1018\n00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,979\nAnd, and I would like to if I can,\nI always like to say,\n\n1019\n00:49:21,979 --> 00:49:26,086\na good way to think about an algorithm and\na key in all those things.\n\n1020\n00:49:26,086 --> 00:49:30,470\nAnd, and, and roll in Kerckhoffs's\nprinciple and all into it,\n\n1021\n00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:36,420\nis think of an algorithm kind of like a,\na, padlock or a combination lock.\n\n1022\n00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,900\nYou can, you open those things up and\n\n1023\n00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,740\nyou can look at the blueprints for\nthem all day long.\n\n1024\n00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,230\nBut that doesn't mean that if you've got\none model lock, and I've got that same\n\n1025\n00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,040\nmodel lock, even if you dissected yours\nand looked at the bru, blueprints for\n\n1026\n00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,220\nit, you know all the different ways the\ntumblers and all that can move in there.\n\n1027\n00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,432\nBut that doesn't tell you what\nthe tumbler combination is for mine.\n\n1028\n00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:00,210\n>> Mm-hm.\nCuz that's unique to your lock.\n\n1029\n00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:01,470\n>> That, that's unique.\n\n1030\n00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:05,180\nYou might be able to stumble upon\nit by fiddling with the things,\n\n1031\n00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:07,808\nand get some measure of luck doing it.\n\n1032\n00:50:07,808 --> 00:50:11,948\nYou know, but you can't tell, you can\ntell the different combinations they\n\n1033\n00:50:11,948 --> 00:50:14,568\ncan go into and\npositions this thing can go into.\n\n1034\n00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:16,087\nBut you can't tell what it is for\n\n1035\n00:50:16,087 --> 00:50:18,463\nmy specific lock without\na lot of trial and error.\n\n1036\n00:50:18,463 --> 00:50:20,832\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1037\n00:50:20,832 --> 00:50:24,690\nAll right well I tell you what it is\ncoming up on the end of this segment.\n\n1038\n00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,640\nWe've pretty much covered\nsymmetric I think pretty well.\n\n1039\n00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,090\nIf there's anything else you\nwant to add on, on that.\n\n1040\n00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,440\nOr, we good with that?\n\n1041\n00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,370\n>> I, I, think we're, I think we're good.\n\n1042\n00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:36,650\n>> Okay, all right well then why don't\nwe stop here and we'll go ahead and,\n\n1043\n00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:38,350\nand, and, and wrap this up.\n\n1044\n00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,960\nAnd then Mon or our next episode\nwe'll come back with a part two and\n\n1045\n00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,380\nthen we'll continue on with some\nasymmetric cryptography, get into hashing.\n\n1046\n00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,770\nIt's hard to look at the public-key\nof a structure and things like that.\n\n1047\n00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,874\nWe'll continue on with\nour cryptography topic.\n\n1048\n00:50:52,874 --> 00:50:53,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1049\n00:50:53,640 -->

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening, and\n\n5\n00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:38,250\nwelcome to another episode of ITPro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,260\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Captain James T,\n\n7\n00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,445\nI mean Mister Sean Oriyano.\n\n8\n00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:44,990\n[LAUGH] How you doing today Sean?\n\n9\n00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,090\n>> Not too bad.\nHow are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:46,970\n>> Doing fantastic.\n\n11\n00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,840\nDoing fantastic.\n\n12\n00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,060\nGlad to be back.\n\n13\n00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:52,900\nEverybody's here for\nchapter two on our CEH track.\n\n14\n00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,880\nAgain, we're going over that fantastic\nbook CEH Certified Ethical Hacker\n\n15\n00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,160\nstudy guide.\n\n16\n00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,480\nWritten by none other\nthan mister Sean Oriana.\n\n17\n00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480\nSo actually I take that back.\n\n18\n00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,270\nWe're not in chapter two,\nwe're in chapter three.\n\n19\n00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,290\n>> Chapter three.\n\n20\n00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:06,420\n>> So, we are continuing on.\n\n21\n00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,090\nThis is part two of an episode,\ncalled cryptography.\n\n22\n00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,600\nSo, if you missed the first part Make sure\nyou go back and check out the recordings.\n\n23\n00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,850\nWe've got part one in we take\na look at some basic concepts.\n\n24\n00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,110\nAnd we started getting into I think\nsymmetric encryption yesterday.\n\n25\n00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,800\nAnd then today we're gonna continue on\nwith some other encryption methodologies\n\n26\n00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,650\nlike asymmetric encryption and\nhashing and a whole bunch of good stuff.\n\n27\n00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,810\nSo let's just dive right in and\nget into it.\n\n28\n00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,450\nAll right.\n\n29\n00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,100\n>> Let's do that.\n\n30\n00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,900\n>> All right, so\nyou know like I said yesterday,\n\n31\n00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,290\nwe talked about our symmetric encryption,\nwe talked, and one of the keys that\n\n32\n00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:43,240\nwe learned there was symmetric encryption\nmeaning the same on both sides.\n\n33\n00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,920\nWe got one key, that key does\nthe encryption as well as the decryption\n\n34\n00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,700\nwhich is one of the flaws\nof symmetric encryption,\n\n35\n00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,390\nor one of the problems that\nwe have was key distribution.\n\n36\n00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,060\nSomehow getting that key\nsecurely to the other end.\n\n37\n00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,450\nSo they can decrypt that information.\n\n38\n00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,090\nAnd the next system we're gonna to use or\n\n39\n00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,910\ntake a look at kinda alleviates\nsome of that problem, right?\n\n40\n00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,960\nWe're getting to talk about\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n41\n00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,080\n>> Absolutely.\n\n42\n00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,758\nHere, let me help you out really quick.\n\n43\n00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:09,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're retro\n\n44\n00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,357\n>> And falls on you.\n\n45\n00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:13,190\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I think the chatroom's already\n\n46\n00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,810\ndetermined that I'm doomed at some point,\n\n47\n00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,810\nthe whole thing is gonna\ncome crashing down on me.\n\n48\n00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,730\n>> We have to do a safety check here.\n\n49\n00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,680\nNo wires back there or anything.\n\n50\n00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,200\nAll right, we're good.\n\n51\n00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,880\n>> You're gonna miraculously\n>> Survive and\n\n52\n00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,390\nI'm gonna be a puddle on the floor.\n\n53\n00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,700\n>> It's like, missed that alright.\n\n54\n00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,090\n>> So yeah, so asymmetric encryption,\nwhat do you think?\n\n55\n00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,410\n>> Asymmetric cryptography is\nit's actually an interesting one\n\n56\n00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,630\nin compared to what we have\n>> Yesterdays\n\n57\n00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,790\ncryptographic technologies were actually\nquite simple when you get down to it.\n\n58\n00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,270\nYou know just substituting things,\nmoving things around, stuff like that.\n\n59\n00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,150\nIt's stuff that is very easily relatable.\n\n60\n00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:00,530\nAsymmetric on the other hand\nis a world apart from that,\n\n61\n00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,120\nnow it solves some of the problems\nthat are inherent in symmetric systems\n\n62\n00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,730\n>> But at the same time,\n\n63\n00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,290\nit also introduces a whole\nbunch of new ones.\n\n64\n00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,630\nGotta remember, nothing you know,\nnothing ever does everything perfectly.\n\n65\n00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,240\nSo, you know,\nyour always gonna get some advantages but\n\n66\n00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:22,130\nyou're gonna have some stuff on the on\nthe other side as well, so, asymmetric,\n\n67\n00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,410\none of the things it solves is,\nit solves key distribution problems, but\n\n68\n00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,190\nit also introduces performance problems,\nto kind of, to kind of mention that.\n\n69\n00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,140\n>> Yes, it's a little heavier\n>> Here then the mathematical algorithms\n\n70\n00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,200\nare much more complex.\n\n71\n00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,820\nAnd so it's, it's a little bit,\nwhat I like to say is, heavier.\n\n72\n00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,250\nIt takes a lot more\nprocessing power to fire.\n\n73\n00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,600\nSo, some of those smaller devices,\nespecially back in the day, or\n\n74\n00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,180\nearly little routers and things like that.\n\n75\n00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,660\nYou know might not have been able to\nkeep up with some of that encryption.\n\n76\n00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,270\n>> Yeah, you actually bring up a very\ngood point, is that some of the is\n\n77\n00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,910\nthat everything in the asymmetric side\nis really mathematically intensive, and\n\n78\n00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,080\nthat's why if you were with us with the\nprevious episode talking about symmetric.\n\n79\n00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,330\nWe said symmetric does,\nis really good on Bulk data,\n\n80\n00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,530\nyou know, large volumes of data,\nyou know, that's, that's great,\n\n81\n00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,140\nbut if you get to asymmetric,\nasymmetric, you know really tanks and\n\n82\n00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,870\ngoes downhill pretty quickly and that's\nbecause of all the transformations and\n\n83\n00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,270\nstuff like that are involved with,\ndoing all these mathematics.\n\n84\n00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,470\nAnd even though computers are good at\ncrunching numbers, you know, they're still\n\n85\n00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,900\ngonna suffer performance problems when you\nshove a whole bunch stuff at em at once.\n\n86\n00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,910\nIt's just the way it works.\n\n87\n00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,960\nYou know, but it's,\n\n88\n00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,300\nasymmetric is still widely used, so\nwe gotta kind of understand, you know,\n\n89\n00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,550\nwhy we would use something that\nseems to have this inherent problem.\n\n90\n00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,130\nIt seems like, well, okay,\nit's, we get one thing but\n\n91\n00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,050\nwe get a big problem on the other side so\nwhy would you use it?\n\n92\n00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,090\nWell, to understand that, and let's take\na look at how asymmetric systems work.\n\n93\n00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,690\n>> Okay.\n\n94\n00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,370\n>> Asymmetric systems work by using a,\nwhat they call a key pair.\n\n95\n00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,850\nAnd the key, a key pair means that we have\ntwo keys that are mathematically related,\n\n96\n00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,490\nyou know, so that we have that\nrelationship between the two and\n\n97\n00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,010\ntypically you would roll into a system\nthat has, you know, that is asymmetric And\n\n98\n00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,430\nyou get these two keys.\n\n99\n00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,070\nAnd you keep one key for yourself,\nor you keep it highly restricted.\n\n100\n00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,640\nAnd the other one is published someplace.\n\n101\n00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,550\nThe one you keep for\nyourself is called a private key.\n\n102\n00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:22,450\nSo it's, no one else sees it, or\nvery few people see it as the case may be.\n\n103\n00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,680\nThe public key goes some place\nwhere other people can get it.\n\n104\n00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,530\nSo anybody can see it,\npretty much freely without restriction.\n\n105\n00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,240\nNow the cool thing about this is,\n\n106\n00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,100\nif you were to compare this to a symmetric\nsystem that would be a big no-no.\n\n107\n00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,350\nYou got one key and if you let\nsomeone see it they can decrypt and\n\n108\n00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,080\nencrypt your stuff.\n\n109\n00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,690\n>> Absolutely.\n\n110\n00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,270\nYeah that's the whole\nthing about symmetric.\n\n111\n00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,210\n>> Yep.\n>> Is that that key has to be kept\n\n112\n00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,950\nbetween only the people that are allowed\nto see that information, right.\n\n113\n00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,750\nAnybody that's privy to the info gets\naccess to that key, and nobody else.\n\n114\n00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,190\nYeah, exactly, so\nwe've got a big problem there.\n\n115\n00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,120\nYou also have an issue where,\n\n116\n00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,320\nif you give someone your key,\nthere's your non repudiation.\n\n117\n00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,310\nIt's gone out the window because\nthey can claim to be you,\n\n118\n00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,080\nand there's really no way around that.\n\n119\n00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,100\nAsymmetric on the other,\nif I have a private,\n\n120\n00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,150\nI can perform any operation with\nmy private key any operation I do\n\n121\n00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,390\nwith that one can only be reversed by\nthe public key, but even though you\n\n122\n00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:19,380\nhave the public key you can't tell\nwhat my private key actually is.\n\n123\n00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,380\nIt's a form of what we call\na zero knowledge proof,\n\n124\n00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,750\nis the real technical term for that.\n\n125\n00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,650\nIt means that I have a way of proving\nthat I have, possession of something.\n\n126\n00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,130\nI can have this key behind my back,\nand do something with it.\n\n127\n00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,510\nAnd just by virtue of the fact that you\ncan reverse it with your public key,\n\n128\n00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,600\nyou know that I've got,\nthat I have my private key back here.\n\n129\n00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,945\nYou don't have to see that.\n\n130\n00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:41,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, so, that's,\n\n131\n00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,730\nthat's the really cool thing about it.\n\n132\n00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,780\nNow, the, ne, the, so\nwhen you look at that system,\n\n133\n00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,870\na couple things that it solves are just\nto go back to, the key distribution.\n\n134\n00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,000\nI no longer have to give\nyou a key to decrypt it.\n\n135\n00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,340\nI, so, I just send you something I've\nencrypted with my A private key.\n\n136\n00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,680\nYou go get my public key and decrypt it.\n\n137\n00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,240\n>> Right.\n>> Done.\n\n138\n00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:01,930\n>> Yeah.\n\n139\n00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,950\nSo that, that, that public key\nis just that, it becomes public.\n\n140\n00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,740\nIn fact, it usually, it's part of what\nwe call a certificate in an electronic\n\n141\n00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,960\ndocument that ties your\nidentity to that key pair, and\n\n142\n00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,510\nthen that certificate can be published.\n\n143\n00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,940\nLike in a windows environment or\ndomain we can publish an active directory\n\n144\n00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,820\nYou can email that certificate\nto everybody and their mother.\n\n145\n00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,150\nYou know who here,\nwho has your public key,\n\n146\n00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,130\nthe private key has to remain private,\nand then, as Sean said, if, if I encrypt\n\n147\n00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,520\nsomething with my private key, the only\nkey that can decrypt it is my public key.\n\n148\n00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,670\nI can't even use the private\nkey again to decrypt it.\n\n149\n00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,030\nSo, if you can use my\npublic key to decrypt it,\n\n150\n00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,690\nthen it had to be encrypted with\nmy private key in the first place.\n\n151\n00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,919\nAnd if I'm doing things right,\nI'm the only one with that private key.\n\n152\n00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,651\nSo that gives us that non-repeatation,\nthe fact that it had to come from me.\n\n153\n00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,243\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n154\n00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:49,358\n>> A sweet system.\n\n155\n00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:54,013\n>> Yeah, it's got some really\nhuge benefits of using it.\n\n156\n00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:55,111\nBut, like I said,\n\n157\n00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:58,888\nthe downsize of it is that you\ntalked about the key distribution,\n\n158\n00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:03,300\nand you talk about non-repudiation there,\nthe fact of the matter is that.\n\n159\n00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,580\nYeah, it has got some great benefits,\nso, yeah,\n\n160\n00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,670\nthis performance thing is an issue so\nyou now, how do we take the benefits of\n\n161\n00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:16,600\nusing a symmetric which is very, which is\nvery good on doing large volumes of data.\n\n162\n00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,680\nWhich is a lot of times\nwhat we're doing with it.\n\n163\n00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,130\nYou have a hard drive, you know,\n\n164\n00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,110\nyou send, transmit over the internet and\nfor e-commerce purposes,\n\n165\n00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,220\nhow do you, how can you use both of\nthose and get the benefits of both?\n\n166\n00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,000\nWell, you know, that's something that\nwe're gonna talk about a little later\n\n167\n00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,990\ncalled hybrid cryptic systems,\nkind of recombine both of these things\n\n168\n00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,800\nto get a much stronger solution than\neither one would be on its own.\n\n169\n00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,553\n>> Try to take the best of both worlds and\nuse them together, right?\n\n170\n00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:43,302\n>> Exactly.\n\n171\n00:08:43,302 --> 00:08:46,010\nYou have them play to each\nother's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n172\n00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,635\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n173\n00:08:46,635 --> 00:08:48,177\n>> And they complement each other.\n\n174\n00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:49,429\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, so\n\n175\n00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,927\na symmetric when you're some\nthings to know about it.\n\n176\n00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:55,210\nAsymmetric just some of the background.\n\n177\n00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,560\nAsymmetric kind of came out of the,\n\n178\n00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,130\ncome on the scene and\nI believe it was the 1960s I believe.\n\n179\n00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,742\nThere some, I think there's a little bit\nof a dispute there on who invented it.\n\n180\n00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:08,400\n>> All right.\n>> I think so, I think someone, and\n\n181\n00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,620\nif I remember correctly, someone in\nEngland said they came up with it, and\n\n182\n00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,610\nthe NSA said yeah,\nwe did that ten years ago so.\n\n183\n00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,245\n>> Of course they did.\n\n184\n00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:16,860\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n185\n00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,270\nthey've got all the records to prove it,\nright?\n\n186\n00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,160\n>> You don't have somebody\nshredding stuff in the background.\n\n188\n00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,490\nSo, it, that was the thing,\nbut in any case.\n\n189\n00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,650\nIn any case, you know,\n\n190\n00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,390\nwe start seeing asymmetric algorithms come\non the scene not too long after that.\n\n191\n00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,110\nAnd, you know once they started,\ncomputing power started picking up enough.\n\n192\n00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,570\nThey could really use these\nin a practical sense.\n\n193\n00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n194\n00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,967\n>> Symmetric is very, kind of is very,\n\n195\n00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:47,860\nyou know non intensive sort to speak.\n\n196\n00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Asymmetric is very intensive.\n\n197\n00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,860\nSo, asking someone to do that,\nis going to be very tough to do.\n\n198\n00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,010\nSo, computing power is key.\n\n199\n00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,140\nNo pun intended.\n\n200\n00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,780\n>> [LAUGH] That was good, I like that.\n\n201\n00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,865\n>> Yeah, I know,\njust gonna slip it right in there.\n\n202\n00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,150\nSo, when we get\n\n203\n00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,160\ndown to some of the cryptographic\nalgorithms that came out of that.\n\n204\n00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:15,020\nWe have several, but some of the ones\nof note was that, we have RSA.\n\n205\n00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> RSA came out.\n\n206\n00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,432\nIt was the first, it was actually has\nthe distinction of being the first U.S.\n\n207\n00:10:20,432 --> 00:10:23,660\nmade asymmetrical crypto, crypto system.\n\n208\n00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,320\n>> Okay.\n>> And so it came out and\n\n209\n00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,432\nit's actually still used.\n\n210\n00:10:26,432 --> 00:10:30,190\nIt's so, powerful that's,\nthat it's actually still in use.\n\n211\n00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,210\n>> It really is amazing.\n\n212\n00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,450\nAnd when we think about how fast\nthings change in security and\n\n213\n00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,330\nthese encryption algorithms, you know,\nprocessor being more powerful.\n\n214\n00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,470\nMost devices being able to handle\ntougher mathematical algorithms.\n\n215\n00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,310\nThe fact that one of our original,\n\n216\n00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,580\nasymmetric algorithms is still\nin use is pretty amazing.\n\n217\n00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,300\n>> Yeah, it absolutely is.\n\n218\n00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,590\nWhen you look at it's still\nvery widely used and kinda in,\n\n219\n00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,510\ninteresting thing on that is you,\nRSA is a company still around.\n\n220\n00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,790\nI get asked that question all the time.\n\n221\n00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,120\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> It's like they look at\n>> Well, RSA, you mean the company or\n\n222\n00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,920\nthe algorithm?\n\n223\n00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,940\nYou got to a.\n\n224\n00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,570\n>> Yes. [LAUGH] >> Make that\ndistinction between the two.\n\n225\n00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,160\nIt's like there is a company, but\ncompany kind of you know got after,\n\n226\n00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,040\ngot after it's initial success\nkind of went to other areas.\n\n227\n00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,290\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n228\n00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,214\n>> So a bit of trivia also on that\nif you're unaware of it is RSA.\n\n229\n00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:14,898\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n230\n00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:18,890\n>> It's the initials of the last name of\nthe three guys that founded it, Revese,\n\n231\n00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,620\nShermere and Addleman.\n\n232\n00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,500\nWho are still around actualy,\nRon Riveste I believe is at MIT.\n\n233\n00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,380\n>> Right.\n>> He's a he still teaches so.\n\n234\n00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,800\nYeah, he still developes\ncrypto systems too.\n\n235\n00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I guess he didn't get enough.\n\n236\n00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,430\n>> So, you know, so.\n\n237\n00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:39,050\nBut, we have RSA, we also have ones\ncalled El Gamore is another one.\n\n238\n00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,090\nThere's Dify Helmen is another one.\n\n239\n00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> You see that one out there.\n\n240\n00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,660\nThere's electrical curve cryptography,\nyou know,\n\n241\n00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,180\nwhich you had kind of somewhat were\nalluding to when you talked about\n\n242\n00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,570\nthese you know mobile devices and\nthings like that.\n\n243\n00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:56,510\nIt was very useful in those environments,\nbecause\n\n244\n00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:00,135\nwhen you look at asymmetric systems,\nasymmetric systems are very power hungry.\n\n245\n00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so, mobile devices,\n\n246\n00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,230\nwhen they first came out, didn't have a\nlot of processing power, and they had, and\n\n247\n00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,220\nthey had limited battery power.\n\n248\n00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,875\n>> Not a good environment if you need\nsomething that lives on number crunching.\n\n249\n00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:12,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you see, because the way it works\n\n250\n00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,280\nwas, you know something that worked\nreally well in that environment.\n\n251\n00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,650\nIt was very low footprint.\n\n252\n00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:22,260\nIn fact, the stuff, the calculations\nthat it did, I think I had a Casio\n\n253\n00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,700\nhand calculator that did that-\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n254\n00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,290\n>> Down in the 80s someplace, so it was-\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n255\n00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,140\n>> But that's kinda some [INAUDIBLE]-\n>> I mean, we're really just plotting,\n\n256\n00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,920\nwe're not gonna get into details\nof how this stuff works.\n\n257\n00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> But, you know,\n\n258\n00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,570\nplotting points on an elliptical curve,\nwhich was-\n\n259\n00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,600\n>> Which is, like you say,\n\n260\n00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,000\nwe could do that with\ncalculators in the past.\n\n261\n00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,050\nSo, it's not all that processor intensive.\n\n262\n00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,230\n>> No, exactly.\n\n263\n00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,980\nSo yeah,\nthat's along a short of asymmetric.\n\n264\n00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,340\n>> Yes, asymmetric you know, and\nthen as we were saying earlier,\n\n265\n00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,150\nwe end up combining, because really\nyou know, look at everything.\n\n266\n00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,920\nWe see asymmetric.\n\n267\n00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,960\nWe might not realize it sometimes.\n\n268\n00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,080\nWhat protocols you're using?\n\n269\n00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,630\nYou know, the different applications\nare gonna be coded to use a particular\n\n270\n00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:01,350\nalgorithm in the background, but\nwe start combining symmetric and\n\n271\n00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,510\nasymmetric, you know, and that,\nthat's what gives us e-commerce, right?\n\n272\n00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,550\nWhen we talk about with symmetric,\n\n273\n00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:09,740\nthe problem is, symmetric is very\ngood at doing bulk amounts of data,\n\n274\n00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,080\nit's very quick, lightweight, but I can't\nget that key to the other end securely.\n\n275\n00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,310\nAsymmetric, no problem with\nkey distribution because,\n\n276\n00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:21,110\nI never have to share my private key, but\nit takes a lot of processing power to do.\n\n277\n00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,850\nSo, how about we tie them together, right?\n\n278\n00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,920\nWhen you look at HDVS you're\nbasically saying hey web sever,\n\n279\n00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,550\ngive you your certificate to prove your\nidentity, you're retrieving that web\n\n280\n00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,210\nserver certificate which includes\nthat web server's public key.\n\n281\n00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,420\nAnd they're the only ones that\nhave their matching private key.\n\n282\n00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,180\nSo now I've got their public key,\nI can generate a symmetric key on my end,\n\n283\n00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,530\nencrypt it with their public key,\nand send it back.\n\n284\n00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,360\nAnd now they've gotta, and they're\nthe only ones who can decrypt it, right?\n\n285\n00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,250\nSo, I don't have to worry about my\nsymmetric key being intercepted\n\n286\n00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,680\nduring that transmission.\n\n287\n00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,890\nThey can decrypt it\nwith their private key.\n\n288\n00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,710\nNow we both have the same\nsymmetric key and\n\n289\n00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,240\nwe can use that, to do the bulk of the\ntransmission for the data transmission.\n\n290\n00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,120\nThe light,\nfast weight protocol we used asymmetric,\n\n291\n00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,980\nnot to encrypt all the data just to\nprotect that key distribution process.\n\n292\n00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,000\nSo we start tying these together,\nand we get the best of both worlds,\n\n293\n00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,400\nand, like I said,\nyou see it all over the place.\n\n294\n00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,240\nDigital signatures, which we'll probably\ntalk about, and all kinds of things.\n\n295\n00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,220\n>> Exactly.\n\n296\n00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,990\nBut, you know, before we you know,\n\n297\n00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,650\nkinda get to that-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n298\n00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,185\n>> You know, we, there's one more thing we\ngotta talk about real kinda quickly here.\n\n299\n00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:25,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Is hashing.\n\n300\n00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,680\n>> Hashing.\n\n301\n00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,030\n>> Yeah, you know,\nhashing is another component where\n\n302\n00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:33,320\nwe got to mix in all of this, because\nwe have symmetric, we have asymmetric.\n\n303\n00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,820\nSo, we got the confidentiality down,\nright.\n\n304\n00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,010\nWe got the and we got the authentication,\nbut we're still missing that I part of it.\n\n305\n00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:44,020\n>> Yeah, that third leg in our triad\nthat we talked about in chapter one.\n\n306\n00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,580\n>> Exactly.\n\n307\n00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,530\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, we have to get that part.\n\n308\n00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,620\nSo, what we're looking at here.\n\n309\n00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,910\nWe got to talk about what hashing does.\n\n310\n00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,190\nHashing is something\nthat you use you know,\n\n311\n00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:56,325\nto solely,\nto validate the integrity of information.\n\n312\n00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you take something and\n\n313\n00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,000\nyou shove it through a hashing algorithm,\nand\n\n314\n00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,470\nit generates a fixed length value that\nacts as a finger print or thumb print.\n\n315\n00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,720\nTo specific, to that specific input,\nand now every input you get put\n\n316\n00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,610\nin should generate something different,\nif it doesn't then we've got a problem,\n\n317\n00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,675\nwe've got, it's called a collision,\nand we don't need, we don't want that.\n\n318\n00:15:17,675 --> 00:15:18,438\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh,\n\n319\n00:15:18,438 --> 00:15:19,952\nthat is a problem we have to worry about,\n\n320\n00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,100\nright, with some of the shorter\nthe hashing algorithm.\n\n321\n00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,861\nWhen you look at like SHA1 versus SHA 256,\nor\n\n322\n00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:29,625\nsomething like that,\nlonger hashing outputs or\n\n323\n00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:34,255\nwhat we call the,\nthe hash value less collisions, right?\n\n324\n00:15:34,255 --> 00:15:35,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because it is a fixed link, and\n\n325\n00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,960\nbecause there's so, you can encrypt it or\n\n326\n00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,430\nyou can run anything through that hashing\nalgorithm, so there is a chance for\n\n327\n00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,550\na collision, which starts to lead to the,\nbreaking of the code.\n\n328\n00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,789\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n329\n00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:50,489\nSo, kind of to understand, you know,\nwhat a little bit about hashing,\n\n330\n00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:55,898\nwhat I'll do here is I'll, I'm gonna show\nyou, kind of what hashing looks like.\n\n331\n00:15:55,898 --> 00:16:01,620\nThis is- What you see here is one of many\nwebsites that have online hash generators.\n\n332\n00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,010\nThis one happens to do MD5 but\nthere's ones that do SHA1,\n\n333\n00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,460\nwhich this one also does as well.\n\n334\n00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,980\nThose are all hashing algorithms.\n\n335\n00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,270\nThose tend to be the two most common\nones you'll run into MD5 and the,\n\n336\n00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,330\nthe SHA family of algorithms.\n\n337\n00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,730\nSo to kinda take a look\nat what we have here.\n\n338\n00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,443\nIf I type in something and say,\nyou know, just Hello world, and\n\n339\n00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:23,054\nsay generate a hash off of it.\n\n340\n00:16:23,054 --> 00:16:26,798\nYou know, you can see, you know,\nkinda faintly up here.\n\n341\n00:16:26,798 --> 00:16:28,934\n[LAUGH]\n>> Mm-hm. [LAUGH] >> You can see up top,\n\n342\n00:16:28,934 --> 00:16:31,343\nyou can see the hash.\nIt generates a,a,\n\n343\n00:16:31,343 --> 00:16:34,062\nyou know, hash value.\nNow that hash value is\n\n344\n00:16:34,062 --> 00:16:37,540\nalways gonna be the same length,\nno matter what.\n\n345\n00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,910\nAnd so you could put through just what I\nput through here, or you could put through\n\n346\n00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:44,860\nthe whole Library of Congress and\nit would still be the same length.\n\n347\n00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,240\n>> Right.\n>> But the value would be different.\n\n348\n00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,990\nSo that's a, that's a key piece here.\n\n349\n00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,050\nThat's defined by the algorithm itself.\n\n350\n00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,730\nThe other thing to remember about,\nabout hashing is\n\n351\n00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,760\nis that hashing is something that doesn't\ndo anything with confidentiality.\n\n352\n00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,930\nWhat I just did to generate that hash,\n\n353\n00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,660\nwhich they sometimes also\ncall a message digest.\n\n354\n00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,700\nIs that when you you know,\nlook at you know, when you,\n\n355\n00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,200\nwhen you look at it is that, you know,\nyeah, you shove stuff through it.\n\n356\n00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,080\nIt's, it's fixed length, it's unique, but\n\n357\n00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,510\ndoesn't do anything to\nprotect the confidentiality.\n\n358\n00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,050\nWe need to remember,\nthat a lot of people get that messed up.\n\n359\n00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,550\n>> You know, and it's tough sometimes\nbecause they do always include hashing\n\n360\n00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,760\nwith the other encryptions, and it, it\nis a form of encryption in a way, right?\n\n361\n00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,530\nIt's generating this cypher text but\nthe key with hashing it is one way,\n\n362\n00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,660\nas Shawn said several times.\n\n363\n00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,330\nThere's no way to take that hash value or\nthat message digest and\n\n364\n00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,620\nturn it back into the original message.\n\n365\n00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,290\nAnd as he points out, my original\ndata Is still there in plain text.\n\n366\n00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,320\nI now just have a signature for\nthe file or the application, or\n\n367\n00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,615\nwhatever it is I'm hashing.\n\n368\n00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:52,640\nSo it, it's not like you are getting\nany of those, as you said,\n\n369\n00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,660\nno confidentiality, no repudiation,\nwe are just doing that integrity.\n\n370\n00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,650\nAnd another thing,\nI don't know if we mentioned,\n\n371\n00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:03,370\none of the big keys that would give\nthe ability to do that integrity.\n\n372\n00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,510\nIs the fact that you can run that same\nset of data through that same hashing\n\n373\n00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:12,570\nalgorithm 100 times and it will always\ngenerate the exact same output.\n\n374\n00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,170\nRight?\nThat's what allows me to\n\n375\n00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,170\nrun that hashing algorithm\non data before it leaves\n\n376\n00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,450\nrun that same hashing algorithm\non that data after it's received.\n\n377\n00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,520\nAnd if those two values match, then I\nknow that data hasn't been modified.\n\n378\n00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,150\nChange a single character in there and\nthat's gonna change my ha, my,\n\n379\n00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,520\nmy message digest and that's how I\nknow that, that data's been modified.\n\n380\n00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,310\nEither maliciously or just through\nnormal data corruption or what have you.\n\n381\n00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:39,660\n>> There's a couple good points there\nto kinda fixate on is when you do\n\n382\n00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,370\nchange something what kinda, when you\nchange something on the input side.\n\n383\n00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,320\nYou know, let's say I put period into\nthe sentence of what I just did here.\n\n384\n00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,420\nIf I put a period at the end of that\nsentence I, I'm going to see a change.\n\n385\n00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,530\nBy what we just said,\nwe're going to see a change in that hash.\n\n386\n00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,450\nThe thing to remember about it is,\nis that how much of a change will you see.\n\n387\n00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,710\nIt's hard to tell with 100% accuracy,\nyou know, how much that,\n\n388\n00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:05,980\nhow much of a change we'll see.\n\n389\n00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,320\nBut the rule of thumb Is that\nwe see a minimum of a 50% change\n\n390\n00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,180\nin that algorithm to be cons, or in that\nhash to be considered a good algorithm.\n\n391\n00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,770\nWe're not saying that's great, if you\ngot a 50% chan, change in there you're,\n\n392\n00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,150\nyou're, you're just enough to be qualified\nas a hashing algorithm, not a good one,\n\n393\n00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,840\njust you're, you're in the zip code right.\n\n394\n00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,810\nSo we should see much more than that.\n\n395\n00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,350\nAnd a lot of time you'll see 100% change,\nyou know, in,\n\n396\n00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,500\nin, in, that, in that actual hash.\n\n397\n00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,586\nSo, we, we definitely want to you know,\n\n398\n00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:38,590\nto keep that in mind when we're\ndoing something like this.\n\n399\n00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,880\n>> And, and we got a good of, couple of\ngood questions out there in the chatroom.\n\n400\n00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,850\nLet's just take a minute here.\n\n401\n00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,640\nAnd Mike was talking about,\nyou know, hashing passwords.\n\n402\n00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,900\nAnd that's typically how most of our\nauthentifications store those passwords as\n\n403\n00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,790\na hash value.\n\n404\n00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,800\nAnd then as you also say,\nthere's something called rainbow tables,\n\n405\n00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,450\nwhich I think we might get into later.\n\n406\n00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,915\n>> Yes, that's a later topic,\nbut you guys are on your game.\n\n407\n00:19:57,915 --> 00:19:58,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll talk,\n\n408\n00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,780\nwe'll explain about the rainbow tables and\n\n409\n00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,400\nthat will go back into our collision\nconcept that we were talking earlier.\n\n410\n00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,350\nAnd some of the weaknesses of hashing and\nwhere we can run into issues with that.\n\n411\n00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,250\nAnd salting.\n\n412\n00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,580\nWhat do you want to say about salting?\n\n413\n00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,110\nI mean,\nthat's really still using the hash, but\n\n414\n00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:17,990\nnow we're trying to make a more difficult,\nbring the, the, to break it.\n\n415\n00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:22,815\n>> Yeah, hashing is mixing in some random,\nsome entropy or some padding into it.\n\n416\n00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:24,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That makes it so,\n\n417\n00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,260\neven if you can determine, and there are,\nthere are some ways, it, it's more,\n\n418\n00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,210\nit's probably better to say\nit's mathematically infeasible.\n\n419\n00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,715\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To reverse something out of\n\n420\n00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:37,650\na hash than it is to say it's impossible,\nit might as well be impossible.\n\n421\n00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,985\n>> Yeah.\n>> But it's, it's gonna be infeasible, is,\n\n422\n00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:42,910\nis, would be the real way to look at it.\n\n423\n00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,632\nWhen you mix salt into it,\nthis randomness actually makes it so\n\n424\n00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:48,462\nit's much more difficult to do that.\n\n425\n00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:50,614\n>> Right.\n>> You could still theoretically do it,\n\n426\n00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:53,416\nbut the computing power would\nbe enormous to pull that off.\n\n427\n00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,008\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n428\n00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:59,281\nYeah and into today's environment,\nwe're not, it keeps us pretty safe.\n\n429\n00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:02,461\nTen years from now, the processing power\ncould punch through it no problem.\n\n430\n00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,721\n>> Yeah, dis, distributed computing\nstuff like that has changed the nature\n\n431\n00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:06,331\nof the game.\n\n432\n00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,067\nYou know, it's still, and\n\n433\n00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:12,166\nthen increase computing power on top\nthat that's adding to it, so who knows?\n\n434\n00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:12,724\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n\n435\n00:21:12,724 --> 00:21:14,670\n>> You know, but that,\nthat's something to think about.\n\n436\n00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,040\nAnd, and just so you guys know,\nwhen I say mathematically infeasible,\n\n437\n00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,010\nmathematically infeasible means, if I,\nit's easy to go one way on a hash, but\n\n438\n00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,050\nto reverse it is very,\nvery tough or infeasible.\n\n439\n00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,990\nThat is a way to look at that as if you\nhad three ten digit prime numbers and\n\n440\n00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,550\nI told everyone hey,\nmultiply those together.\n\n441\n00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:38,060\nI don't care how you do it, just do it.\n\n442\n00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,710\nBut you guys can pull up calculator right?\n\n443\n00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,290\nAnd do that really quickly and\nsay here's the answer.\n\n444\n00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,350\nNow if I told you on the other hand,\nhere's,\n\n445\n00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,960\nhere's here's that answer without\nknowing the prime numbers that I put in.\n\n446\n00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,783\nI'm saying tell me which\nthree prime numbers I I did,\n\n447\n00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:53,699\nI put multiplied together to get that.\n\n448\n00:21:53,699 --> 00:21:54,697\nI just ruined your whole day.\n\n449\n00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:59,439\n[LAUGH] You know I, I,\nI that you could, it could be done, but\n\n450\n00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:01,268\nit's very infeasible.\n\n451\n00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:02,173\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n\n452\n00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:06,690\n>> So, but that's kinda what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n453\n00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,095\n>> Yeah, you know, very good.\n\n454\n00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:11,005\nSo hashing again and\nwe put the quotes around it and\n\n455\n00:22:11,005 --> 00:22:12,954\ntalk about encryption, right?\n\n456\n00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:16,366\nBecause it doesn't protect your data,\nis giving me that data integrity.\n\n457\n00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:19,633\nAnd, and we'll take a closer look at it\nwhen we start getting to authentication\n\n458\n00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:20,560\nsome things like that.\n\n459\n00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,990\nWe'll, we'll hit some of the topics\nyou guys are pulling up in the chat\n\n460\n00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,880\nroom there.\n\n461\n00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,790\n>> Exactly.\n\n462\n00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,350\n>> All right.\nSo let's see what we got next.\n\n463\n00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,980\nPublic key infrastructure.\n\n464\n00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,270\nYou know we've, we've used that term,\n\n465\n00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,680\npublic key, private key, I'm, I'm thinking\nthat has something to do with that.\n\n466\n00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,420\n>> Yeah, that's gonna, that's,\nthat's what our next step is,\n\n467\n00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:41,450\nis this is all building toward something\ncalled, public key infrastructure.\n\n468\n00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,505\nWhere we have, a whole way of,\nmanaging and exchanging keys.\n\n469\n00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:48,060\n>> Right.\n>> Because that's one of the things that,\n\n470\n00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,300\nyou know, we really haven't\nmentioned in terms of asym,\n\n471\n00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,820\nin terms of you know, asymmetric yet.\n\n472\n00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,116\nAsymmetric yeah,\nwe've talked about generating a key pair.\n\n473\n00:22:57,116 --> 00:22:57,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n474\n00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,928\n>> And you introduced the concept of\na digital certificate but, you know,\n\n475\n00:23:00,928 --> 00:23:02,770\nwho's responsible for managing that?\n\n476\n00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:03,400\n>> Right.\n\n477\n00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,690\n>> You know, so that's, that's the, that's\nthe next step as to give you a peek ahead.\n\n478\n00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,724\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's the next thing we have to do is,\n\n479\n00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,062\nis figure out,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n480\n00:23:11,062 --> 00:23:13,950\n>> How we can set up a structure, where\npeople that don't even know one another.\n\n481\n00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,840\nI mean, what do you, what do you,\nwhat do you have when you,\n\n482\n00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,230\nwhat, what do you do when you need\nto exchange keys with someone?\n\n483\n00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,800\n>> Right.\n>> You know, if I don't know you how do I\n\n484\n00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,680\nexchange a key, keys with you,\nand you exchange keys with me?\n\n485\n00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,040\nDo, do, we just gonna say okay,\nwe trust each other?\n\n486\n00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,462\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> Or, you know, there's, you know,\n\n487\n00:23:29,462 --> 00:23:30,655\nit doesn't really work that way.\n\n488\n00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:31,224\n>> No, no.\n\n489\n00:23:31,224 --> 00:23:33,707\n>> We have to figure it out\n>> Maybe between you and me, and, and,\n\n490\n00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:36,321\nand you know, Star Trek quotes, but\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n491\n00:23:36,321 --> 00:23:37,644\n>> Not when we're dealing\nwith our corporate data and,\n\n492\n00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:38,506\n>> It's like give me your credit card\n\n493\n00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:39,850\nstuff, I know I got,\nI'll write it down, you know.\n\n494\n00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,720\n>> Yeah exactly\n>> You can trust me.\n\n495\n00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,600\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> Yeah, that's,\n\n496\n00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,500\nyou gotta,\nyou gotta think about those things.\n\n497\n00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,210\n>> Yeah.\n>> So that's wha,\n\n498\n00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,005\nthat's what we're building towards is\ndoin, is having a way to manage that.\n\n499\n00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:50,330\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> And it builds all these things into it.\n\n500\n00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,090\n>> Good deal, good deal.\n\n501\n00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,181\nAll right.\nWe're looking at our clock.\n\n502\n00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:55,947\nWe're just about out of time for\nthis episode er, this segment here, so\n\n503\n00:23:55,947 --> 00:23:59,961\nwhy don't we save that public key\ninfrastructure For when we come back,\n\n504\n00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:01,413\nwe're gonna get into PKI.\n\n505\n00:24:01,413 --> 00:24:04,670\nAlso gonna talk a little bit\nabout hybrid cryptosystems.\n\n506\n00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,620\nSo you guys stay tuned.\n\n507\n00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,607\nWe'll be right back.\n\n508\n00:24:07,607 --> 00:24:13,130\n[MUSIC]\n\n509\n00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:17,006\nAll right welcome back everybody we\nleft off talking about cryptography, and\n\n510\n00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,670\nwe're going to jump right back in to it.\n\n511\n00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:23,990\nAnd we're gonna talk a little bit now\nabout PKI or public key infrastructure.\n\n512\n00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:29,930\n>> Yup, public key infrastructure,\nso we've got, we've, we've got a, a,\n\n513\n00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,860\nquite a bit of ground to cover here.\n\n514\n00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,270\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we can, but\n\n515\n00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,900\nthere's an easy way to really do this, you\nknow, so, we're going to do an easy way.\n\n516\n00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,740\n>> I like easy, I like easy.\n\n517\n00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,415\n>> I'm lazy, never said I was\nprofessional, I said I was lazy.\n\n518\n00:24:40,415 --> 00:24:41,939\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so,\n\n519\n00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:46,122\nlike I need to tell people about\nprofessional, look what I'm wearing.\n\n520\n00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:48,028\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n521\n00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,863\n>> Anyway, so what,\n\n522\n00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,775\nwhat we have we're gonna talk about PK.\n\n523\n00:24:53,775 --> 00:24:58,697\nPKIs is, what PKI is or\nPublic Key Infrastructure is it's a way of\n\n524\n00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:02,203\nmanaging and\nidentifying the owners of keys.\n\n525\n00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:05,785\nIt's really a key management system\nyou know, so when we look at it,\n\n526\n00:25:05,785 --> 00:25:08,095\nwe have to think about it in those terms.\n\n527\n00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:11,595\nWell, what we have, the players\nwe have in public infrastructure,\n\n528\n00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:15,095\nwe have our big players\nof certificate authority.\n\n529\n00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:18,593\nAnd certificate authorities who\nare responsible for, people enrolling in\n\n530\n00:25:18,593 --> 00:25:22,115\nthe system an, and authenticating and,\nfiguring out who they are.\n\n531\n00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:25,735\nOnce it knows who they are, it figures\nout if they are authorized to have a key.\n\n532\n00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:30,330\nBut there's something else we're gonna\nmix in even in, during this process,\n\n533\n00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:34,880\nis there's something called a digital\ncertificate that comes into the picture.\n\n534\n00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,430\nNow, it's all well and good to say hey,\nhere's a key pair, you know, and\n\n535\n00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,830\nthis is your, this is your private,\nthis is your public.\n\n536\n00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,490\nBut, you know, how do you identify that\nyou're the real owner of these things?\n\n537\n00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,070\nYou know,\nwe have to find some way of doing that.\n\n538\n00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,300\nAnd that credential,\nis a digital certificate.\n\n539\n00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,830\nA CA is responsible for issuing that.\n\n540\n00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,660\nSo a digital certificate, what it is,\nis it's a credential, much like,\n\n541\n00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,772\nthe example I like to use,\nI like to use a driver's license.\n\n542\n00:25:58,772 --> 00:25:59,276\n>> Exactly.\n\n543\n00:25:59,276 --> 00:26:04,060\n>> Because,\nit works quite well when we look at it.\n\n544\n00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,602\nA digital certificate, if we look at\nthe context of a driver's license,\n\n545\n00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:08,500\nyou know,\nwhat does a driver's license have on it?\n\n546\n00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,036\nIt has a serial number on it,\nit's got information about who you are,\n\n547\n00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:17,439\nit's got that, got all that various\nstuff on it, pictures, all that.\n\n548\n00:26:17,439 --> 00:26:17,962\n>> And I had, and\n\n549\n00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:20,551\nI had to prove all that in order to\nget that license issue to me, right?\n\n550\n00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:21,154\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n551\n00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:24,778\n>> You had to bring in depending you\nhad to bring in birth certificates and\n\n552\n00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:26,507\nelectric bills and DNA samples.\n\n553\n00:26:26,507 --> 00:26:27,853\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I know right?\n\n554\n00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:32,100\n[LAUGH]\n>> Your first born and stuff like that.\n\n555\n00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:37,470\n>> And that's the, and that's that\nthing when you look at when you look at\n\n556\n00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,210\nthe system you know,\nyou mentioned when you bring in and\n\n557\n00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:43,850\nyou go to get your driver's license\nyou have to bring all this stuff in.\n\n558\n00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,480\nWe have to do the same thing with\na digital ce, digital certificate.\n\n559\n00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,240\nWe just can't give it to you.\n\n560\n00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,850\nYou have to prove you know, that you're\nauthorized, if you need to have it.\n\n561\n00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,555\n>> I can't call up VeriSign and say, hey\nI want a certificate, I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n562\n00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:56,315\n>> Yeah.\n\n563\n00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you have to,\n\n564\n00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,250\nyou have to actually prove it.\n\n565\n00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,590\nAt some point they're\ngonna ask you to prove it.\n\n566\n00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,990\nYou know, it's kinda an interesting thing.\n\n567\n00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,050\nSome of the ones will\nissue a temporary one.\n\n568\n00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,600\nAnd your certificate will be\nflagged as that saying; yeah,\n\n569\n00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,900\nthis is what you're claiming to be,\nbut it's unverified.\n\n570\n00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,320\nIf you want to get the really super\nstrong ones, you have to be verified.\n\n571\n00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,760\nAnd they're going to\nask you at that point,\n\n572\n00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,220\nif you claim to be me, well, prove it.\n\n573\n00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,140\nAnd then you're going to have\nto provide that paperwork.\n\n574\n00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,330\nAnd since, presumably, you can't,\nthey won't verify it as that.\n\n575\n00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,390\nSo you know, but when you look at\na driver's license same thing.\n\n576\n00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,420\nYou got to provide those cre,\nyou've got to provide those credentials,\n\n577\n00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:34,095\nbirth certificate or something that can,\nthat can assert your identity.\n\n578\n00:27:34,095 -->

00:27:41,990\nBecause remember, you can't just go down\nto the DMV and provide those things and\n\n581\n00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:43,205\ngive me a drivers license.\n\n582\n00:27:43,205 -->

gotta\ndo behind the wheel.\n\n585\n00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:50,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, you've gotta,\n\n586\n00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,450\nyou've gotta be authorized.\n\n587\n00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,340\nAnd you get authorized\nby doing these things.\n\n588\n00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,510\nSo it's the same thing for\ndigital certificates.\n\n589\n00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,690\nYeah, we need to authenticate you.\n\n590\n00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,380\nSome how you know,\nthat could be through active directory,\n\n591\n00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,370\nif you're in the Windows world.\n\n592\n00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,420\nIt could be through, you know, documents\nthat you provide to a third party.\n\n593\n00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,410\nIt could be you know any of those things,\njust some way of getting those nice warm\n\n594\n00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,400\nfuzzy feeling that someone\nis who they say they are.\n\n595\n00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,793\nOnce you have, I mean, once you have that,\n\n596\n00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:20,980\nwe can, see what certificate you're issued\nthat you're allowed to have issued to you.\n\n597\n00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, much, like I said,\n\n598\n00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,860\nmuch like a driver's license\nyou gotta pass a test.\n\n599\n00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,280\nYou know, so once you pass that test,\n\n600\n00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,360\nyou're authorized to\nhold certain privileges.\n\n601\n00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,770\nDigital certificate,\nI can issue that with the appropriate

this.\n\n604\n00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,230\nOr, you are allowed to\ndo encryption with this.\n\n605\n00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,800\n>> So\n>> Or, any number of things.\n\n606\n00:28:43,800 -->

as you're saying, I can get a\ndriver's license, but I don't have a CDL.\n\n609\n00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,110\nOr I don't have a motorcycle\nendorsement cuz I didn't have the right\n\n610\n00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,870\nqualifications or\nhaven't presented that information yet.\n\n611\n00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,020\n>> Exactly.\n\n612\n00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,330\nAnd, and, and in,\nsomething else to mention on that.\n\n613\n00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,790\nAnd since you gave me a really good\nopening for it, for that is that yeah you,\n\n614\n00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,600\nyou can, if you get a driver's license,\n\n615\n00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,950\nyou can get all those ratings on one\nlicense and have that one credential.\n\n616\n00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,700\nBut if you try to get a,\nif you're trying to do something else,\n\n617\n00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,422\noperate some other type of\nvehicle that doesn't have wheels.\n\n618\n00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:25,330\nLet's say, you know, a plane, you can't\nput that on, that, on that license.\n\n619\n00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,610\nYou gotta do something else.\n\n620\n00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,440\nIn a digital world we can still,\n\n621\n00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,120\nwe can still have the ability to merge\nthem all onto one digital credential.\n\n622\n00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,230\nBut we can also make, say, you can\nhave one credential for signatures,\n\n623\n00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,220\none credential for encryption,\none credential for this, it's all,\n\n624\n00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,205\nthat's a management thing.\n\n625\n00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:46,170\n>> Yeah, I've had several people ask\nme why, why issue multiple certificates\n\n626\n00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,910\nif you can take a certificate and\nmake it multi-purpose.\n\n627\n00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:52,220\nAnd do encryption and digital\nsignatures and EFS, you know, whatever.\n\n628\n00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,700\nAnd usually what I'll say is,\nis that how do you manage the certificate?\n\n629\n00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,880\nYou might want your EFS certificate\nin Windows environment for\n\n630\n00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,240\nencrypted file system.\n\n631\n00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,550\nYou might want that certificate\nto be valid for five years.\n\n632\n00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,020\nBut the one that they use for\ndigital signatures,\n\n633\n00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,740\nyou might want the validity period\non that one to be good for one year.\n\n634\n00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,920\nAnd if you combine those certificates,\nyou can't have different validity periods.\n\n635\n00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,020\nWhere as they're separate certificates,\nnow I, I can do that.\n\n636\n00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,610\nSo, it just depends on how to want to\nmanage those certificates and those keys.\n\n637\n00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,890\n>> That 100% right,\nit's really a management thing.\n\n638\n00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,740\nIf you are, if you're looking for\na way to manage these or,\n\n639\n00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,020\nor to issue these you need to\nconsider how you're gonna manage it.\n\n640\n00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,400\nYou know,\nhere's another way to look at it,\n\n641\n00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,840\nwhat if you had you know,\nall the stuff that you mentioned.\n\n642\n00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,240\nOne for signatures, one for EFS,\none for all these things, and\n\n643\n00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,200\nit was on one certificate, and\nthey all had five year, validity periods.\n\n644\n00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,790\nWhat if you decide at some point that\nyou need to revoke the privileges of\n\n645\n00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,700\none of those?\n\n646\n00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,260\nYeah.\n\n647\n00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,370\nYou're, you're stuck and you gotta\nrevoke the whole thing and reissue it.\n\n648\n00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:50,600\nThat's a huge nightmare you\ndon't wanna have to do.\n\n649\n00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,030\nIt may not be a nightmare\nif you're talking you know,\n\n650\n00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:56,270\nonly a small group of users, but\ntypically if you're handling your own\n\n651\n00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,973\nPKI-,\n>> Um-hm.\n\n652\n00:30:56,973 --> 00:30:58,561\n>> You're not doing\na small number of users.\n\n653\n00:30:58,561 --> 00:31:02,680\n[LAUGH] So, you might wanna really,\nseriously consider that.\n\n654\n00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,590\n>> Absolutely.\n\n655\n00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,290\n>> So you know, so once we know\nabout the digital certificate and\n\n656\n00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,392\nwe know that we have you enrolled in\nthe system, get a digital certificate.\n\n657\n00:31:09,392 --> 00:31:11,260\nThey do,\ntake all this information from you.\n\n658\n00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,000\nThey put a, they bind your public\nkey to this, to make sure that,\n\n659\n00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,410\nhey, here, if you look it,\nif you're looking for this person.\n\n660\n00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,850\nThere, is there a public key.\n\n661\n00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:23,195\nAnd then to make sure this is all,\nyou know,\n\n662\n00:31:23,195 --> 00:31:27,120\n100% correct, they actually hash it too\nand put another fingerprint on there.\n\n663\n00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,520\nBecause you don't want someone saying,\nI'm gonna alter this and, or\n\n664\n00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,390\nstick another key on here.\n\n665\n00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,640\nYou wanna say this together\n>> We hash this all together and\n\n666\n00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,430\nwe put this thumb print on it so you know\nthat, hey, you can rehash all this and\n\n667\n00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,550\nif the hash matches,\nthen everything's cool.\n\n668\n00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,724\nSo there's one of our technologies\ncoming back into play, you know, so\n\n669\n00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:46,450\nwe're actually two when we look at it.\n\n670\n00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,841\nWe've got our asymmetric already with the\npublic and private key coming into play.\n\n671\n00:31:50,841 --> 00:31:52,525\nAnd we also have our hashing.\n\n672\n00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:53,477\nAlright.\n\n673\n00:31:53,477 --> 00:31:56,655\nNow once you have those be,\nthat system set up,\n\n674\n00:31:56,655 --> 00:32:00,342\nyou have CA is your central thing and\nit's doing all of this,\n\n675\n00:32:00,342 --> 00:32:04,670\nnow you have different people that\nwill go and set up trusts with that.\n\n676\n00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,550\nAnd so, a CA, actually,.\n\n677\n00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,320\n>> [COUGH]\n>> Another term for\n\n678\n00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,360\na CA interestingly enough\nis a trusted third party.\n\n679\n00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,260\nOkay, so now once we, and\nthese different parties will trust it,\n\n680\n00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:17,190\nnow to kind of really understand the easy\nway to understand this to make this as\n\n681\n00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,610\nsimple as possible, is, it's kind of like\nsaying, you know, if I haven't you know,\n\n682\n00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:26,680\nmet you before, and you know, but\nwe both have a mutual friend, what we\n\n683\n00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,350\ncan say is that oh well, I don't know you\nbut you know, I know this guy back here.\n\n684\n00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,850\nAnd he knows you and I trust him so\nI'm gonna trust you.\n\n685\n00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:38,020\n>> The old if A trusts B, and B trusts C,\nthen A trusts C, type of thing.\n\n686\n00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,060\n>> Exactly.\n\n687\n00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> So you know, we're gonna assume that A,\n\n688\n00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,335\nwell since you trust him, I trust him.\n\n689\n00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,911\n[CROSSTALK] know we're gonna trust one\nanother even though we've never met.\n\n690\n00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:46,600\nThat's what PKI is really doing.\n\n691\n00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,930\nYou know, so now, if I say,\nhey, this is who I, you know,\n\n692\n00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,820\nthis is who I am, present you something,\nyou can ask that,\n\n693\n00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:57,603\nthat CA, you know, who I, you know, who I\nam, and it can verify that, saying yeah,\n\n694\n00:32:57,603 --> 00:33:01,770\nI've got credential on file for\nthis person, and here's their public key.\n\n695\n00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:05,380\nNow, you can take that public key and\nreverse what I did even though I've never\n\n696\n00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,340\nsent you anything except saying I've\nencrypted this, I've used this algorithm,\n\n697\n00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,580\nand this is who I am, so I send that\nto you, and then you just go ahead and\n\n698\n00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,915\ntake it from there,\nyou go up to that CA that you trust, and\n\n699\n00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:22,695\nI trust and, and go ahead and\nget my key and do whatever.\n\n700\n00:33:22,695 --> 00:33:25,465\n>> And you know, and you notice he's\nmentioned the word trust like six or\n\n701\n00:33:25,465 --> 00:33:29,837\nseven times here, cuz that's really what,\nwhat PKA's all about is about trust.\n\n702\n00:33:29,837 --> 00:33:33,337\nJust cuz once that CA, certificate\nauthority, issues that certificate,\n\n703\n00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:37,167\nas Sean said, hashes it, puts that\nthumbprint on there, the CA signs it.\n\n704\n00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:39,527\nRight?\nIt puts their good name on there.\n\n705\n00:33:39,527 --> 00:33:43,887\nAnd then, if you, the certificate is\nonly as good as the trust you have for\n\n706\n00:33:43,887 --> 00:33:45,377\nthe issuing authority.\n\n707\n00:33:45,377 --> 00:33:47,447\nIf you don't trust the person\nthat issued the certificate,\n\n708\n00:33:47,447 --> 00:33:48,897\nthen you don't trust the certificate.\n\n709\n00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:52,867\nMuch like my Florida driver's license,\nif I get pulled over by the police here in\n\n710\n00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,320\nFlorida, they can pull out\nmy driver's license and\n\n711\n00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,860\nthey don't have to re-verify\nall the information.\n\n712\n00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:01,090\nThey know the state of Florida verified\nall that before they ever issued\n\n713\n00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,460\nme the driver's license.\n\n714\n00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,750\nSame thing with certificates, right?\n\n715\n00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,110\nIf I trust the authority, then, I'm gonna\ntrust the information on there's valid.\n\n716\n00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,170\nIf I take that driver's\nlicense over to Europe, or\n\n717\n00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:13,480\nsomewhere there, where they've never\nseen a Florida driver's license before,\n\n718\n00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,590\nthey're not gonna be so quick to trust\nthe information that's on there.\n\n719\n00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:20,700\nThey don't trust the issuing authority,\nand it's not going to allow me to use,\n\n720\n00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,870\nor it's going to be more\ndifficult to use that.\n\n721\n00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,490\nSo it really just all comes down to trust,\nyou know,\n\n722\n00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,940\ntrusting the issuing party,\nbecause as you said, the third party.\n\n723\n00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,480\n>> Exactly, and I saw, you know,\none of the questions come through here.\n\n724\n00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,920\nIt says, you know you're paying more for\ncertificates for trust, you know, that,\n\n725\n00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,980\nyou know, that's, that's actually true\nis that if the, if [LAUGH] You know,\n\n726\n00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,720\nsomebody's it's not usually exorbitant\nwhat you're paying for certificates.\n\n727\n00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:47,920\nBut there is some, there is some\ndifference in cost if you are a well\n\n728\n00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,525\nknown CA versus one that's, you know, just\na new a new guy on the block you know,\n\n729\n00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:57,960\nthey may both be worthy of your trust the\nsame way but if one is a bigger name and\n\n730\n00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,230\nmore people know this one you\nare probably going to pay more over here\n\n731\n00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,020\n>> Like in most uses in Windows for\n\n732\n00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:07,400\nexample there is a whole list of of PKI's\nthat my computer already knows to trust\n\n733\n00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,020\nVeriSign, GT, Equifax and so I can go to\nthem and pay money and get a certificate.\n\n734\n00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,530\nAnd I know that just about everybody\nout there that's running Windows\n\n735\n00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,010\nis gonna trust that certificate.\n\n736\n00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:22,060\nI could also set up my own PKI for free in\na virtual machine on my computer, right.\n\n737\n00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:26,310\nBut if I try to use one of those\ncertificates that I issued, not too\n\n738\n00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,882\nmany people know to trust Mike's,\nMike's PKI.\n\n739\n00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:35,949\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] No, don't do it.\n\n740\n00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:39,176\n[LAUGH] So, Yeah, so, yeah,\n\n741\n00:35:39,176 --> 00:35:43,800\nPKIs do rely very, very much on, on trust.\n\n742\n00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,030\nIf trust isn't there,\nthe system is very questionable, at best.\n\n743\n00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,764\n[LAUGH] You know,\nthat's just the way to look at it.\n\n744\n00:35:52,855 --> 00:35:56,125\nSomething else to remember when\nyou're talking about PKI, and CAs,\n\n745\n00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:58,845\nand all, and the whole deal with it\n\n746\n00:35:58,845 --> 00:36:01,680\nis it's not something that's\nbound to a specific platform.\n\n747\n00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,275\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n748\n00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:05,265\n>> You know, that's something that I\nkinda always like to throw out there.\n\n749\n00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:10,495\nPKI is something that\ncan appear on Windows,\n\n750\n00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:13,735\ncan appear on Unix, can appear on Linux,\nor, you know, what have you.\n\n751\n00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:16,730\nIt's a set of standards.\n\n752\n00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,130\nWe don't care how the technology\ntakes place underneath the hood,\n\n753\n00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,840\nyou just have to offer services and\n\n754\n00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,120\nverify things the same way in\nthe same format and we're good.\n\n755\n00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,190\n>> Right.\n>> You know, that's it, you know, so\n\n756\n00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,570\nwe're talking kind of generically,\nit's different from technology,\n\n757\n00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,700\nwe're talking about the concepts\nof how things work.\n\n758\n00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,103\n>> Yeah, and I also want to mention too,\nnow I'm not knocking private,\n\n759\n00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:37,790\nyou know there is a very good use for\nprivate CAs.\n\n760\n00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:41,430\nYou know I tease when saying nobody\nis going to trust Mike's CA.\n\n761\n00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,550\nBut if the certificates\nare being used in-house for\n\n762\n00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,900\nsending e-mails between co-workers or\nfor EFS for\n\n763\n00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,020\nexample where I'm not gonna be\nusing those certificates outside,\n\n764\n00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,250\nI can save a lot of money by running my\nown PKI and issuing my own certificates.\n\n765\n00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,330\nSo we might have a combination.\n\n766\n00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,530\nI might have some certificates\nissued in-house by my own PKI where\n\n767\n00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,920\nmy computers on my network know to trust\nmy PKI and then other certificates that we\n\n768\n00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,610\npurchased from these major vendors and\nthese big CAs out there.\n\n769\n00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,760\nThe public guys.\n\n770\n00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,740\nThat everybody knows to trust, for my,\nmy websites, my external resources,\n\n771\n00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,590\nand things like that.\n\n772\n00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,320\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n773\n00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,840\nI mean, and, and there's something,\nalso, to kind of throw into it.\n\n774\n00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,910\nYou know, this is a great time to mention,\nis that you know,\n\n775\n00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,850\nsome organizations are actually\nlooking at, you know, heck.\n\n776\n00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:25,310\nWe will just put our own CA together and\nown it.\n\n777\n00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,640\nYou know, what if you are, let's,\nlet's say what if you're you know,\n\n778\n00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,480\na governmental organization and you want\nto be able to, you know, use you know, use\n\n779\n00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,420\ncertificates for your people and go across\ndifferent organizations in the government.\n\n780\n00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,860\nYou know, there, in those cases, some of\nthe places have actually set their own\n\n781\n00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,290\nprivate CAs instead of\ngoing third party when,\n\n782\n00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,160\nin, in situations where\nthey could go third party.\n\n783\n00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,065\nAnd the reason for that is they're\nworried again about that word trust.\n\n784\n00:37:51,065 --> 00:37:52,850\n>> Um-hm.\n>> It's, it's they don't want to say,\n\n785\n00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:53,930\ngo to a third party.\n\n786\n00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,320\nAs trustworthy as they may be.\n\n787\n00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,230\nI feel like I'm using\nthe word trust way too much.\n\n788\n00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,309\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You always have to though.\n\n789\n00:38:01,309 --> 00:38:02,530\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know, with this topic\n\n790\n00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,530\nit really is all about trust.\n\n791\n00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,755\n>> Somebody get me a thesaurus.\n\n792\n00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:08,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you know, if you,\n\n793\n00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,070\nif you look at it.\n\n794\n00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,900\nYou know, once you, you,\nif you look at an agency like that,\n\n795\n00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,020\nthey want to own their own CA, because\nthey don't wanna give it to a third party,\n\n796\n00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,550\nand say, okay, you got all our trust, and\neverything's placed in you outside of us.\n\n797\n00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,010\nThey wanna bring that in-house.\n\n798\n00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:23,730\n>> Wanna keep the control.\n\n799\n00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,790\n>> That's being done, yeah.\n\n800\n00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,800\n>> Okay, yeah.\n>> They wanna contain,\n\n801\n00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,890\ncontrol everything in the end.\n\n802\n00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,940\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n803\n00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,910\nSo, a good information\npublic infrastructure,\n\n804\n00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:35,490\nis the, as Shawn stated, you know,\nit's a platform independent terminology.\n\n805\n00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,927\nA set of standards that we follow\nto manage, issue manage and\n\n806\n00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:43,850\nmaintain certificates\nthroughout their lifetime.\n\n807\n00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:49,380\nAnd the certificates are what ties your\nidentity to that public key pair that\n\n808\n00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,045\nwe can use to do our\nasymmetric encryption.\n\n809\n00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:55,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n810\n00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,410\n>> Very, yeah, very good.\n\n811\n00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,990\nSo and the next thing that we kind of\nwant to lead into that is our hybrid\n\n812\n00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,650\ncrypto systems.\n\n813\n00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,940\nThe word hybrid to me immediately makes\nme think some kind of combination or\n\n814\n00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,970\nnot quite the original, alright.\n\n815\n00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,880\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n816\n00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,910\n>> If you think of Prius.\n\n817\n00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:12,868\n>> Yeah Prius [LAUGH]\n>> I'm kidding.\n\n818\n00:39:12,868 --> 00:39:18,240\n[LAUGH] If you drive a Prius I am\njust teasing, they are nice cars.\n\n819\n00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,315\n>> Yeah, that's what he is saying,\nif you drive a Prius get out.\n\n820\n00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,600\n[LAUGH]\n>> Our viewing list just went,\n\n821\n00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,442\ngot a lot shorter all of a sudden.\n\n822\n00:39:25,442 --> 00:39:29,650\n>> [LAUGH] Hey,\nwe just lost half of our audience.\n\n823\n00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,240\nWell the thing I wanted to, the thing you\nwant to look at with hybrid cryptosystem,\n\n824\n00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,560\nwe've already kind of alluded to it.\n\n825\n00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,370\nIf you look at hashing,\nhashing does integrity but\n\n826\n00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:38,815\nit doesn't do confidentiality.\n\n827\n00:39:38,815 --> 00:39:39,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n828\n00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:45,080\nWe look at asymmetric systems, asymmetric\nis good at doing non-repudiation.\n\n829\n00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,910\nBut it's, it's in, in key management but\nreally is horrible on bulk data.\n\n830\n00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:51,841\nSo that's, that's a problem.\n\n831\n00:39:51,841 --> 00:39:52,533\nThen we look at symmetric.\n\n832\n00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,764\nSymmetric is great on bulk data but\nthere's no non-repudiation and\n\n833\n00:39:55,764 --> 00:39:57,275\nkey management is a nightmare.\n\n834\n00:39:57,275 --> 00:40:01,095\nEvery one of those offers a,\nsomething that it does well and\n\n835\n00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:03,655\nthen offers stuff that it doesn't do well.\n\n836\n00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:05,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's the way it works.\n\n837\n00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,390\nNothing is, nothing is you know,\njack of all trades in this, in this thing.\n\n838\n00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,540\nSo what we got to do is we got to find\nsome way of combining these to make\n\n839\n00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,810\na better solution.\n\n840\n00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:18,425\nSo one way, one example of a, of a hybrid\ncryptosystem that does that is SSL.\n\n841\n00:40:18,425 --> 00:40:19,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n842\n00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,450\n>> SSL does that by,\ndoes its job for e-commerce sites,\n\n843\n00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,010\nwhich is where you commonly see that.\n\n844\n00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,000\nIt's not the only place, but it's\nthe most common place you'll see that.\n\n845\n00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,400\nWhat SSL does is SSL says, okay, I don't\nhave a prior relationship with you,\n\n846\n00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,815\nyou know, I'm, let's say I'm\nbuying something from Amazon.\n\n847\n00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:37,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So I buy something from Amazon, and\n\n848\n00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,630\nI, I know who Amazon is,\nbut I wanna get a nice,\n\n849\n00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,270\nwarm, fuzzy feeling when I'm exchanging\nmy, you know, my credit card information.\n\n850\n00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:49,170\nSo, the way that happens is\nAmazon has a digital certificate.\n\n851\n00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:53,530\nAnd what I will do is I will verify\nthat Amazon is who they say they are,\n\n852\n00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,810\ngrab a copy of their public key, and\n\n853\n00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,820\nthen what I will do is find out what\nsymmetric algorithms Amazon, supports and\n\n854\n00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,800\nwhich ones I support and\nchoose one that's the strongest.\n\n855\n00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,800\nYou know, let's see AES,\ngood symmetric algorithm.\n\n856\n00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,790\nI will generate a key using AES, and\nthen encrypt it with Amazon's public key.\n\n857\n00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,270\nNow, if we're following this whole process\nhere, you know, what's happening is,\n\n858\n00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,550\nis that we are setting up a situation\nwhere when I send that, when I encrypt\n\n859\n00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,290\nthat, that symmetric key with,\nwith Amazon's public key, who can open it?\n\n860\n00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,170\nAmazon.\n>> Only Amazon,\n\n861\n00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,770\ncause they're the only\nones with the private key.\n\n862\n00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:28,720\n>> Yeah.\nYeah, exactly.\n\n863\n00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,100\nYou know, they're the only ones that\nhave access to that private key so\n\n864\n00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:33,200\nthey're the only ones that\ncan reverse that process.\n\n865\n00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,620\nI don't care if anyone else can go\nout there, and, and, and see it.\n\n866\n00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,260\nYou can't decrypt it.\n\n867\n00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,160\nYou know, you just can't, because Amazon's\nkeeping their private key a secret.\n\n868\n00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,650\nSo Amazon gets that, decrypts that\nbundle and you know, gets that you know,\n\n869\n00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,040\ngets that deal and you know, decrypts it.\n\n870\n00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,770\nGets the key out of it and now they've\ngot the key for AES, I've got the key for\n\n871\n00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,380\nAES now I can send all the data back and\nforth that we want.\n\n872\n00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,020\nAnd I don't have to worry about anyone\nelse in between intercepting that\n\n873\n00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,655\nsymmetric key.\n\n874\n00:41:58,655 --> 00:42:00,600\n>> Right.\n>> So we saw you know,\n\n875\n00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,820\na couple of big problems here.\n\n876\n00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,240\nYeah, it's very elegant.\n\n877\n00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,651\nAnd, and if you really get down to it you\nknow, asymmetrical the way we use it,\n\n878\n00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:08,529\nyeah, we encrypted something with this.\n\n879\n00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:12,260\nInstead of, like we said, it really\nwas horrible on large amounts of data.\n\n880\n00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,800\nA key is not a large amount of data.\n\n881\n00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,908\n[LAUGH] It's a small piece so-\n>> Teeny tiny.\n\n882\n00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:19,158\n>> Yeah, it's slower, it's still slower\nif you comp, got down to the nuts and\n\n883\n00:42:19,158 --> 00:42:21,430\nbolts, but it's insignificant.\n\n884\n00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:22,900\nIn, in, in, in terms of what we're doing.\n\n885\n00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,800\n>> So we're really taking advantage of the\nbest parts of each one of those, right?\n\n886\n00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,680\nWe're using the symmetric encryption\nto do the bulk amount of work\n\n887\n00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,930\nbecause that's what it's good at.\n\n888\n00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:32,970\nWe're using the asymmetric encryption\nto protect the key during distribution\n\n889\n00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:34,760\nbecause that's what it excels at right?\n\n890\n00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,840\nSo we're taking advantage of\nthe best parts of both of them and\n\n891\n00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,310\ncombining them into one nice solution.\n\n892\n00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,100\nAnd one quick question.\n\n893\n00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,130\nThere are a couple questions I\nsaw going through the chat room.\n\n894\n00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,470\nI might hit some of those on our\nnext break, we talk about CA's and\n\n895\n00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,620\na little more detail than we\nprobably need to go into here.\n\n896\n00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,470\nBut I did see something about TLS,\nand TLS, transport layer security,\n\n897\n00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,900\nreally almost the same thing as SSL, and\nnot compatible though, keep that in mind.\n\n898\n00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,500\nIf one end is speaking TLS and the other\nend is speaking SSL Not gonna work.\n\n899\n00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,020\nBoth ends have to be speaking to you less.\n\n900\n00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,130\nBoth ends speaking as a cell.\n\n901\n00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:09,180\nAnd there is a migration in process\nmoving from SSL I think to TLS.\n\n902\n00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,570\n>> Yes.\nSo they're, they're,\n\n903\n00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,850\nthey're very close cousins.\n\n904\n00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:14,175\nThey're not the exact\nsame thing obviously.\n\n905\n00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:14,850\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n906\n00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:18,590\n>> Well in fact, memory serves there is\none version that chose basically SSL and\n\n907\n00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:19,960\nthey just called it TOS.\n\n908\n00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,758\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n909\n00:43:20,758 --> 00:43:21,259\n>> You know?\n\n910\n00:43:21,259 --> 00:43:22,865\nSo that may be a little bit of a fuzziness\n\n911\n00:43:22,865 --> 00:43:26,179\nthere but for the most part yeah they're,\nthey're we're just going to say that\n\n912\n00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:28,570\nthey're not they're not compatible,\nwhich is true.\n\n913\n00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,970\nBut they're very closely related.\n\n914\n00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,390\n>> Yeah.\nThey still have the same purpose.\n\n915\n00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:34,940\nAnd they almost work the same way.\n\n916\n00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,210\nIt's just,\nI think more stronger algorithms and\n\n917\n00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,170\nbetter stuff in the background\nthat just keeps it more secure.\n\n918\n00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:44,396\nSSL's another one that's been around for\na little while the concept.\n\n919\n00:43:44,396 --> 00:43:46,630\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Netscape if [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Netscape there you go.\n\n920\n00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,540\nSo it's been around a little while and the\nnice thing about SSL is you can improve it\n\n921\n00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,010\nby just using stronger\nalgorithms as we go.\n\n922\n00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,160\nBut it gets to a certain point where we\nmight need to change some of the inner\n\n923\n00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,680\nworkings of it.\n\n924\n00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,510\nAnd that's where TLS really comes in.\n\n925\n00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,990\n>> Exactly so i, i, if you\n>> If, if you you know,\n\n926\n00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:09,820\nare look to talk about TLS and\nSSL, you know, just you, for\n\n927\n00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,570\nright now you can just say hey everything\nthat we talked about applies to both.\n\n928\n00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:13,520\n>> Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\n929\n00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,270\n>> You know we don't need to kinda,\n\n930\n00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,000\nyou know, you know get down to brass taxes\n>> Don't need to differentiate\n\n931\n00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,180\nbetween the two at this point.\n\n932\n00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,095\n>> Yeah, yeah so everyone just calm down.\n\n933\n00:44:21,095 --> 00:44:24,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Alright, so we got SSL.\n\n934\n00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:26,770\nAnother hybrid might be something\nlike digital signatures.\n\n935\n00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,310\n>> Yeah, digital signature's another\ngreat term, and, a, o, or, or,\n\n936\n00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,680\nanother great technology to look at.\n\n937\n00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,710\nAnd the thing I want to really draw your\nattention to in this, when I talk about it\n\n938\n00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,555\njust briefly, is pay attention because\nthis one is using asymmetric and hashing.\n\n939\n00:44:40,555 --> 00:44:41,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's not using asymmetric and\n\n940\n00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:42,500\nsymmetric.\n\n941\n00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,650\n>> Right.\n>> It's using asymmetric and hashing.\n\n942\n00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,935\nAnd pay attention to what order\nthe keys are used in, you know,\n\n943\n00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,169\nbecause this is something that is\ngonna help you on, on your test.\n\n944\n00:44:51,169 --> 00:44:52,091\n[LAUGH] And in real life.\n\n945\n00:44:52,091 --> 00:44:55,525\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when we, when we get down to it,\n\n946\n00:44:55,525 --> 00:44:58,795\nif we look at if we look at digital\nsignature, what digital signature's gonna\n\n947\n00:44:58,795 --> 00:45:02,865\ndo is I always like to say, think of a\ndigital signature when someone is signing\n\n948\n00:45:02,865 --> 00:45:06,575\nlike a you know, loan for\na house, or something like that.\n\n949\n00:45:06,575 --> 00:45:09,409\nWhen you do an ink and\npaper signature, your signature, the,\n\n950\n00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,934\nthe characteristics of your\nsignature are tied to you.\n\n951\n00:45:11,934 --> 00:45:16,838\nSo it authenticates to you when you sign a\ndocument, you are saying that hey, I agree\n\n952\n00:45:16,838 --> 00:45:21,533\nto this version of the document, and so\nwhen you, when you apply that to it,\n\n953\n00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:25,180\nyou apply your John Hancock,\nso to speak, to that document.\n\n954\n00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,525\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You're saying, it's me,\n\n955\n00:45:26,525 --> 00:45:29,815\nI agree to this version of the document,\nand boom, done.\n\n956\n00:45:29,815 --> 00:45:33,070\nYou know, and I can't repudiate\nthat because it's my signature.\n\n957\n00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:33,995\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So it's been authenticated,\n\n958\n00:45:33,995 --> 00:45:38,085\nand under repudiation, can, you know,\nand I got the integrity part, okay?\n\n959\n00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:40,015\nThat's all the things a digital\nsignature is supposed to be doing.\n\n960\n00:45:40,015 --> 00:45:41,235\nThe exact same stuff, but\n\n961\n00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:45,025\nwe have to find a way to enable that in,\nin the digital world.\n\n962\n00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:50,410\nSo the way we do that is if we look at,\nyou know, we got integrity, non imputation\n\n963\n00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:55,966\nand we, and we've got you know, our\nauthentication, all that stuff going in.\n\n964\n00:45:55,966 --> 00:45:58,196\nWe've got the technologies for\nthat right now.\n\n965\n00:45:58,196 --> 00:46:02,084\nSo, what we can do is when we create\na document, let's, we're just going to say\n\n966\n00:46:02,084 --> 00:46:05,130\nan email to keep it easy, but\nthis can work on a lot of things.\n\n967\n00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,800\nWhat I can do is I will you know, create\nan e, create an email then it will hash\n\n968\n00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,820\nthat email with a hash none other\nthan my choice, we can say MD5, and\n\n969\n00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:20,300\nI hash it using MD5 and\nthen what I will do is the person I will\n\n970\n00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:24,450\ntake that document and\nbefore I send it to whoever.\n\n971\n00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,780\nI will take that document.\n\n972\n00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:30,290\nSo you know it's hashed I take my\nprivate key out encrypt that hash.\n\n973\n00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:34,746\nAnd now what I do is I take that, that,\nthose items that are bound together and\n\n974\n00:46:34,746 --> 00:46:36,062\nsend it of to someone.\n\n975\n00:46:36,062 --> 00:46:40,941\nWhen someone gets that what's gonna happen\nis that they're gonna see it came from me.\n\n976\n00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:45,907\nAnd when they see it came from me,\nthey will go out to the CA retrieve\n\n977\n00:46:45,907 --> 00:46:49,719\nmy public key and\nthey will use the public key to re,\n\n978\n00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:53,905\nto decrypt that bundle and\nthen they will see that hash.\n\n979\n00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:58,160\nPlus the what algorithm I used to,\nto hash that with.\n\n980\n00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,640\nAt which point they, all ready, when they\nget to that, if they were able to decrypt\n\n981\n00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,825\nit, they've authenticated it, and\nthey've done our repudiation on it too.\n\n982\n00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:11,310\n>> Because if I was able to obtain your\npublic key and decrypt that hash value.\n\n983\n00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,860\nNot, not decrypt the hash values and\nreverse the hashing algorithm, but\n\n984\n00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:18,680\nhe took the hash value and\nencrypted it with his private key, right?\n\n985\n00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,645\nSo if I can retrieve the hash\nvalue out of that encryption.\n\n986\n00:47:21,645 --> 00:47:23,230\nUsing his public key,\n\n987\n00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,515\nthen it had to be encrypted with\nyour private key in the first place.\n\n988\n00:47:26,515 --> 00:47:27,145\n>> Hundred percent.\n\n989\n00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:29,175\nTrue.\n>> And if your private key is only held\n\n990\n00:47:29,175 --> 00:47:32,025\nby you, then,\nthat signature had to be applied by you,\n\n991\n00:47:32,025 --> 00:47:34,565\nso there we get our non-repudiation.\n\n992\n00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:35,665\n>> Exactly.\n\n993\n00:47:35,665 --> 00:47:37,510\nAnd then, but we've still got\none more thing to do, right?.\n\n994\n00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,631\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's that integrity aspect.\n\n995\n00:47:39,631 --> 00:47:41,602\nTo do integrity, you, what do we do?\n\n996\n00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:44,053\nI told you we've got a hash,\nand we also have a, a,\n\n997\n00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:48,043\na stamp telling us what algorithm I used,\nand those algorithms are standardized.\n\n998\n00:47:48,043 --> 00:47:50,029\nI don't have to send\nthe algorithm with the stuff.\n\n999\n00:47:50,029 --> 00:47:52,446\nI just tell you what I used.\n\n1000\n00:47:52,446 --> 00:47:57,246\nIf I told you to use MD5, you just gonna\ngo use MD5 to rehash the document and\n\n1001\n00:47:57,246 --> 00:47:59,510\nthen compare the two hashes.\n\n1002\n00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:03,190\nIf they match, that document\nwas not altered in transport.\n\n1003\n00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,630\nYou know, if they are, they, if they\nare different, then we've got a problem,\n\n1004\n00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:09,820\nit's not what I intended to,\nfor you to receive.\n\n1005\n00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,130\nAnother thing is, don't impl,\n\n1006\n00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:15,180\nit doesn't imply that there was any,\nany thought behind the alteration either.\n\n1007\n00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,380\n>> It might not be malicious, it could\njust be normal data corruption through\n\n1008\n00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,410\ntransmission, a drop hack,\nor something like that.\n\n1009\n00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:20,990\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1010\n00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:24,000\nIt just means that you got\nsomething that's not that's not,\n\n1011\n00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,460\nthat's not what I intended you to have.\n\n1012\n00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,360\nAnd you have to ask for\nit to be resent to you.\n\n1013\n00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,250\n>> That's pretty sweet.\n\n1014\n00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,600\nWe got there just by applying\nthe digital signature.\n\n1015\n00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,830\nWe got to do non-repudiation,\n\n1016\n00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:36,880\nverify that the source of\nthe data as well as integrity.\n\n1017\n00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,050\nMake sure that data hasn't been\nmodified and it's in its original form.\n\n1018\n00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,570\nSo, another hybrid system\nwhere we're combining\n\n1019\n00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:46,820\nThe in this case asymmetric encryption\nwith that hashing algorithm.\n\n1020\n00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:48,580\nSo, we see a lot of hybrids in use.\n\n1021\n00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,150\nReally when it comes down to it.\n\n1022\n00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,570\nBecause I think as Sean said,\neach one has its strengths and\n\n1023\n00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,010\nweaknesses and we can combine them\nto get the best of both words.\n\n1024\n00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:56,720\n>> Exactly.\n\n1025\n00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,870\nThat's, that's the way it works.\n\n1026\n00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:03,720\nSo, you need to have knowledge of every\none of these systems and how they work.\n\n1027\n00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,920\nAnd then you can start figuring out ways\nto combine it to make something that's\n\n1028\n00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,510\ngreater than the sum of its parts.\n\n1029\n00:49:09,852 --> 00:49:12,720\n>> All right, so, so\ntell us what we need for the exam.\n\n1030\n00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,490\nWhat are some tips that we can\nthrow out there to everybody?\n\n1031\n00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:18,280\nBecause there's a lot to it, right?\n\n1032\n00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,180\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> I mean, with the encryption, and\n\n1033\n00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,320\nthe algorithms, you can spend a lot\nof hours studying this stuff.\n\n1034\n00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,160\nAll the different algorithms,\nwe don't need to go in and\n\n1035\n00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,270\nsee how each one of these algorithms work,\nright?\n\n1036\n00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,970\nWe don't need to understand\nthe mathematical formulas,\n\n1037\n00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:31,282\nwhat do we need to know?\n\n1038\n00:49:31,282 --> 00:49:36,460\n>> Okay, yeah, you're right, you don't\nneed to get into all the mathematics and\n\n1039\n00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,180\nstuff like that.\n\n1040\n00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,442\nIf you want to that's on you.\n\n1041\n00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,210\n[LAUGH] But you don't need to know that.\n\n1042\n00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,540\nWhat you do need to know to\nbe successful at this is you\n\n1043\n00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:47,940\nneed to be able to differentiate\nsymmetric From asymmetric and\n\n1044\n00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,320\nfrom hashing, so you need to know that.\n\n1045\n00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,680\nYou also need to know what\nalgorithms fit into each bucket.\n\n1046\n00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,700\nYou know, so if I were to approach you and\nsay AES or DES or\n\n1047\n00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,620\nTriple DES, you need to go and say,\noh, okay, that's, that's this.\n\n1048\n00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,090\nWhy is that important to know that?\n\n1049\n00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,420\nWell, not only do I want you to\nbe Successful on the exam, but\n\n1050\n00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,600\nI also wanna give you something\nthat's practical as well.\n\n1051\n00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:13,230\nThere's technologies out there that will\ntell you when you read their paperwork,\n\n1052\n00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,905\nthey will say, this is using AES.\n\n1053\n00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:19,607\n[CROSSTALK] how safe is that.\n\n1054\n00:50:19,607 --> 00:50:23,216\n>> Yeah, knowing, having knowledge of\nthese algorithms will actually tell you\n\n1055\n00:50:23,216 --> 00:50:24,610\nwhat that system is doing.\n\n1056\n00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,930\nIf you tell me something is using AES or\nTriple S and\n\n1057\n00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:32,980\nit has the ability to support SHAW and\nMD5, I know what those are and\n\n1058\n00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,740\nI can think of scenarios where,\nyou know, what's being done.\n\n1059\n00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:40,430\nYou know, I can assume that it's probably\nsending large volumes of data, and\n\n1060\n00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,470\nit's probably doing something to check the\nintegrity of it, because it's got that.\n\n1061\n00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,690\nIf it's got both of those,\n\n1062\n00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,820\nI might be able to include digital\nsignatures in there somewhere.\n\n1063\n00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,490\nSo that's where that comes in.\n\n1064\n00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:56,250\nSo for, the test may ask you some\ndirect questions about encryption\n\n1065\n00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:59,660\nalgorithms I can assure you\nthat we'll be there, but\n\n1066\n00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:03,300\nthey're also have encryption mixed\nin a lot of other technologies.\n\n1067\n00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:09,920\nLike IP sec, SXL, TLS as was mentioned,\nthey will all be in there.\n\n1068\n00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:17,740\nSo, really kind of, you know, make sure\nin each bucket, as well as, key sizes.\n\n1069\n00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:23,700\nYou need to know that, and\nget that down definitely understand PKI,\n\n1070\n00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:27,750\nPKI is going to figure into a lot of\nthings that you actually see, you know,\n\n1071\n00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:32,620\nso those are the kinds of areas I see that\npeople traditionally have problems with.\n\n1072\n00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:34,140\nSo if you ca kind of keep\nthose all straight and\n\n1073\n00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,990\nthat alphabet soup all clear\nyou're probably doing fine.\n\n1074\n00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,740\n>> Yeah, and PKI is a big topic too and\n\n1075\n00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:41,910\nI think it's kind of a little bit of\nassumed knowledge in here I think when we\n\n1076\n00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:44,840\nget to this level, so\n>> If anybody's having trouble with\n\n1077\n00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,060\nunderstanding PKI or anything like that,\nif you're a member make sure you go\n\n1078\n00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,420\ncheck out some of our, we covered in\nsome of our Windows Server classes,\n\n1079\n00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,790\nnow that would be, you know, Microsoft\nCentric but the concepts of PKI because\n\n1080\n00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,560\nit's a standard\n>> Would apply anywhere outside of\n\n1081\n00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,300\nMicrosoft as well so\n\n1082\n00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,740\nthat's a good place to look if you\nneed some more information there.\n\n1083\n00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:06,570\n>> Yeah, good if you want to, if you did\nwant to do some hands-on with PKI, and,\n\n1084\n00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,440\nand since the, since the,\nthe courses are out there for\n\n1085\n00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:14,140\nthose of you that have access to them or,\nand you should get access if you don't.\n\n1086\n00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:15,720\nThat's me selling right there.\n\n1087\n00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,885\nSelling.\n[LAUGH] Yeah, good job.\n\n1088\n00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:22,070\n[LAUGH]\n>> In all seriousness yeah, it's something\n\n1089\n00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:26,585\nthat I, I kind of stay away from tying\nit to a specific platform at this point.\n\n1090\n00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:28,500\nCuz I want you to get the concept.\n\n1091\n00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,910\nBut once you've got the concept down,\n\n1092\n00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:33,360\nif you want to get in the trenches and\nactually do it.\n\n1093\n00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:33,880\n>> Right.\n\n1094\n00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,450\n>> Then yeah, by all means.\n\n1095\n00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,070\nYou've got access to this, you've got\naccess to the stuff, you might as well go\n\n1096\n00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:43,470\ninto one of these Windows courses and,\nand read about how a CA is set up, and\n\n1097\n00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:46,870\nconfiguring it, and you'll find,\nonce you get the concepts down here,\n\n1098\n00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:51,160\nif you've never set up PKI before, it's,\nit's easy, it makes a lot of sense.\n\n1099\n00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,035\nYou know You'll just go,\nyou'll breeze right through it.\n\n1100\n00:52:53,035 --> 00:52:54,915\nSo do the concepts and, if you want,\n\n1101\n00:52:54,915 --> 00:52:57,555\nand then consider doing the hands-on\nif you haven't done it.\n\n1102\n00:52:57,555 --> 00:53:01,705\nI'll tell you, a lot of people work\nwith PKI, but they don't actually work\n\n1103\n00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:05,075\nwith PKI, meaning they set it up, they\nknow what it is, but they never set it up.\n\n1104\n00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:06,895\nSo it's a good exercise to do,\nat least, at least once or\n\n1105\n00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:07,485\ntwice-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1106\n00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:08,505\n>> To, kinda, get it in your mind.\n\n1107\n00:53:08,505 --> 00:53:09,345\n>> Absolutely.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1108\n00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:13,475\nAll right.\nWell, anything else you want to add on\n\n1109\n00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:14,575\nour cryptography episode?\n\n1110\n00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:15,790\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1111\n00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:18,170\nI, I think we kind of\nwrapped it up pretty good.\n\n1112\n00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:19,350\nI think we we're.\n\n1113\n00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:20,230\n>> Yes, we did.\n\n1114\n00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,290\n>> Doing it quite nicely.\n\n1115\n00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,630\n>> All right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1116\n00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:27,420\nthat is going to do it for\npart two of our Cryptography episode.\n\n1117\n00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,630\nRemember in today Today's episode we\nstarted with asymmetric encryption.\n\n1118\n00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:32,730\nWe went into some hashing algorithms.\n\n1119\n00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:37,230\nWe talked about public key infrastructure,\nwell we talked about hybrid cryptosystems\n\n1120\n00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:41,470\nlike SSL and digital signatures and\nthen some exam tips.\n\n1121\n00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:45,340\nAnd in our previous episode part one,\nwe went through asymmetric encryption,\n\n1122\n00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,850\nI'm sorry, symmetric encryption,\n\n1123\n00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,840\nand little bit of the history of\nencryption, and things like that.\n\n1124\n00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,860\nSo, make sure you check that out as well.\n\n1125\n00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,525\nRemember, if you got any questions\nlive during the show Anytime,\n\n1126\n00:53:55,525 --> 00:53:57,755\njump in our chatroom and ask questions.\n\n1127\n00:53:57,755 --> 00:54:00,855\nWe will respond to them\nas we can live on air.\n\n1128\n00:54:00,855 --> 00:54:02,945\nIf you're watching this as a recording,\nthen remember,\n\n1129\n00:54:02,945 --> 00:54:06,925\nthe top of every page on\nitpro.tv is a link to our Q&A.\n\n1130\n00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:09,740\nYou can jump in there You\ncan ask your questions.\n\n1131\n00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:13,440\nAll the hosts here monitor those and\nwe'll get you the answers you need.\n\n1132\n00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,810\nSo signing off for IT Pro,\n\n1133\n00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:18,560\nwe thank you guys for watching,\nappreciate everybody for being here,\n\n1134\n00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,390\nwe'll be coming back with another\nepisode shortly so, thanks for watching.\n\n1135\n00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,530\nAgain, signing off for\nIT Pro TV, I'm Mike Roderick\n\n1136\n00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,615\n>> And I'm Shaun live long and

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,750\nAnd welcome to another episode of ItProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,350\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,710\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,240\n>> Not too bad.\n\n9\n00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,280\nHow are you doing today?\n\n10\n00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,090\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,960\nI'm really excited about today's episode\nbecause we're continuing on with our CEH\n\n12\n00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,530\nshows, and we're going over Sean's book,\n\n13\n00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,680\nCEH's Certified Ethical Hacker\nversion 8 Study Guide.\n\n14\n00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,032\nAnd today we're getting\ninto some good stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:04,030\nWe're gonna be hitting Chapter 4, which is\nall about footprinting and reconnaissance.\n\n16\n00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,220\nSo it really is the beginning\nof that hacking cycle.\n\n17\n00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,760\nIt's phase one of our hacking cycle.\n\n18\n00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,430\nSo without further ado, we'll dive in and\n\n19\n00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,910\nwe'll start off with our footprinting and\nreconnaissance.\n\n20\n00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,250\n>> Sounds good.\n>> All right, let's do it.\n\n21\n00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,900\nSo where are we gonna start, Sean?\n\n22\n00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,330\n>> Well, I think we first need to set\nup what actually footprinting is.\n\n23\n00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,780\nIt's an important part of the process,\nit's a key part of the process really.\n\n24\n00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,120\nSo we really need to get an intimate\nunderstanding of it before we start moving\n\n25\n00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,860\nin and gathering information and\ndoing demos.\n\n26\n00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,980\nWe need to figure out why it is we're\nputting ourselves through this.\n\n27\n00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,230\nFirst of all, what footprinting is, and\n\n28\n00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:49,180\nit's also called reconnaissance, and that\ngives you a clue to what's happening here.\n\n29\n00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:53,065\nWhen you do footprinting\non an organization, or\n\n30\n00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:56,520\nyoure target if you want to be more\ngeneric about it, you're trying to gather\n\n31\n00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,880\ninformation about who they are,\nwhat they do, why they do it.\n\n32\n00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,720\nJust anything you can get.\n\n33\n00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,630\nNow the thing is that there's so\n\n34\n00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,130\nmany sources that we can\ngather this information from.\n\n35\n00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,860\nInternet's been a very powerful utility\n[LAUGH], and allowed us to do that.\n\n36\n00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,710\nAnd social media is part of that\nhas been even more powerful.\n\n37\n00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,520\n>> Huge, right?\n\n38\n00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,420\n>> That's just a few.\n\n39\n00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,370\nThat's just a couple things, really.\n\n40\n00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,610\nThere's so many sources that\nyou can get information from.\n\n41\n00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,300\nAnd that's really my goal here\nin this footprinting process,\n\n42\n00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,130\nis that there is low-hanging fruit\nto say okay, yeah there's Internet,\n\n43\n00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,170\nyeah there's Google and\nthere's some other sources out there.\n\n44\n00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,820\nI'm sure each and every one of\n\n45\n00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,130\nthe attendees here can probably come\nup with their own sources on it.\n\n46\n00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,170\nBut I want to expand your horizons and\n\n47\n00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,100\ntie all these things together to show you\nthe tools that we really have available.\n\n48\n00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,720\nAnd show you how gathering\nthis information\n\n49\n00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,010\ncan really help you target\nyour attack much better.\n\n50\n00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,970\nIf you don't do this phase\nyou're kind of going in blind.\n\n51\n00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,930\nYou're basically putting\non a blindfold and\n\n52\n00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,600\nkind of hunting around looking for\nsomething.\n\n53\n00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,970\nYou'll be successful, or\nyou can be successful,\n\n54\n00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,090\nbut the odds are kinda\nstacked against you.\n\n55\n00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,694\nIt's not impossible to have\na successful hacking process, but\n\n56\n00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,263\nthat's like saying it's not impossible to\neat an ice cream cone from the bottom up.\n\n57\n00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:20,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can do it but it's gonna be messy.\n\n58\n00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,276\nSo that's just something to really\nthink about, the first step.\n\n59\n00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:28,100\nBe prepared to spend a good amount\nof time here really working\n\n60\n00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,600\nit to get good information.\n\n61\n00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,250\n>> Cuz the more you\nknow about your target,\n\n62\n00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,980\nthe more information you have, that's just\ngonna give you more opportunities, right?\n\n63\n00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,430\nMore vectors that you might be be able\nto get in with, and things like that.\n\n64\n00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,780\nSo, the ability to really see\nthe big picture about what\n\n65\n00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,730\ninformation is out there\nabout your target.\n\n66\n00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,280\n>> Yeah and it's really phenomenal\nthe amount of information that is put out\n\n67\n00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,200\nthere.\n\n68\n00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,260\nIt's always fascinating for\n\n69\n00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,209\nme to look at this process and see\nthe reactions I get when I show people.\n\n70\n00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:00,253\nHey, take a look at this and\ntake a look at this.\n\n71\n00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:03,829\nAnd they're just,\neven people that have been around this for\n\n72\n00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,301\na long time will look at this and\nsay, wow,\n\n73\n00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:12,000\nI had no idea that that information was\nout there, it was that easily accessible.\n\n74\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,910\nThis is usually where people that\nlook at this course or read a book or\n\n75\n00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,000\nsomething on this, is usually the phase\nwhere they start to get a little paranoid.\n\n76\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,740\nThey're like, wait a minute.\n\n77\n00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,450\nSo some of you might be finished watching\nthis footprinting reconnaissance portion\n\n78\n00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,570\nand then be spending the next few\ndays drinking a lot of coffee and\n\n79\n00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:33,695\ntrying to remove your online presence.\n\n80\n00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So don't worry.\n\n81\n00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,592\nIt really is a fascinating thing.\n\n82\n00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:46,650\nI would also consider the footprinting\nprocess to be not only something that\n\n83\n00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,864\nyou can use to help target your attack and\nfine tune it for the hacking process.\n\n84\n00:04:51,864 --> 00:04:56,368\nIt's also something you should\nconsider if you work for a company,\n\n85\n00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:57,950\nor if you are consulting.\n\n86\n00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:03,794\nIt's something that you'd actually think\nof teaching people in security awareness.\n\n87\n00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:07,480\nI've had some success with that,\noutside of ethical hacking,\n\n88\n00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,250\nshowing people just little pieces that\nI'm showing here to show them the type of\n\n89\n00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,844\nthings they're putting out\nthere in the smog, so to speak.\n\n90\n00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,144\nIs that when you put something out there,\n\n91\n00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:21,965\nit kind of becomes sort of information\nsmog that kind of sits around.\n\n92\n00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,280\nAnd once it's out there, it's kinda hard\nto put the genie back in the bottle.\n\n93\n00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,480\n>> It really is, and\nI think a lot of people, as you said,\n\n94\n00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,670\nare very surprised at how much\ninformation is out there and\n\n95\n00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:34,210\navailable to the public,\nto anybody that knows where to look.\n\n96\n00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:40,080\nIt's not like a lot of this stuff is\nreally, I said, it's publicly available.\n\n97\n00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,240\nI'm not breaking into servers and\npicking locks and things like that.\n\n98\n00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,790\nI'm just using my head and\nusing the tools available to anybody.\n\n99\n00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,500\nAnd you'd be surprised how much\ninformation you can glean.\n\n100\n00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,900\n>> Exactly.\n\n101\n00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,720\nThat's really something to keep in mind.\n\n102\n00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,902\n>> Mm-hm.\nSo we're talking about footprinting.\n\n103\n00:05:57,902 --> 00:06:00,200\nWe've talked about where\nit fits in in the process.\n\n104\n00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,070\nSo it's our first phase in our hacking\ncycle, and it's really what gives us all\n\n105\n00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,610\nthe information or where we gather most\nof the information about our source.\n\n106\n00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,880\nAnd I said that it's publicly available.\n\n107\n00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,870\nIs it legal?\n\n108\n00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,170\nI mean, is footprinting a legal process?\n\n109\n00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,880\n>> This is one that I seem\nto get really frequently.\n\n110\n00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,182\nAnd the best answer is to say that yes,\nit is legal, because\n\n111\n00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:33,170\nat this stage we are not really hacking\ninto anything to get any information.\n\n112\n00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:39,340\nWe are gathering it from public sources\nand maybe some few other areas.\n\n113\n00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,730\nBut generally it's not\nconsidered to be illegal.\n\n114\n00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,490\nWhere it would start crossing\nthe area of being illegal,\n\n115\n00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,390\nis if you start using\ntechniques like pretexting,\n\n116\n00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,970\nwhere you're calling someone under false\npretenses to get information out of them.\n\n117\n00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,326\nWhich is a technique you\nvery well could use,\n\n118\n00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:57,240\ncuz there is a social\nengineering component to this.\n\n119\n00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,701\nSo, you need to think about that when you\nstart doing physical interactions, trying\n\n120\n00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:07,060\nto, deceiving people, then that could be\nconsidered to be an illegal part of this.\n\n121\n00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,460\nBut for the most part, the information\nwe're gathering is publicly out there,\n\n122\n00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,010\nit's publicly available.\n\n123\n00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,720\nIt's something that really\nanybody has access to.\n\n124\n00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,920\nWhat we're doing is we're taking a piece\nhere, and a piece here, and a piece here,\n\n125\n00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,210\nand we're stitching it together to weave\nthis tapestry and see what's going on.\n\n126\n00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,190\nSo it's really not illegal.\n\n127\n00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,820\n>> Yeah.\nSo\n\n128\n00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,840\nit might be information that\nthey don't want you to have.\n\n129\n00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,250\nBut it's something that they didn't\ndo a good job in protecting or\n\n130\n00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,670\nobfuscating or what have you,\nso it is out there.\n\n131\n00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,590\nSo at this point we\nhaven't broken any laws.\n\n132\n00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,292\nWe were just gathering information\nfrom publicly available sources,\n\n133\n00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:48,630\nnot necessarily what they want me to have,\nbut it's out there.\n\n134\n00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,837\n>> Yeah, what I tend to say\nis that when you are doing\n\n135\n00:07:53,837 --> 00:07:58,920\nthis process,\nif you're doing it passively.\n\n136\n00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,870\nWhich, there's a big component\nof this that is passive.\n\n137\n00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,650\nIf you're doing it passively,\nyou're probably okay.\n\n138\n00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,380\nAnd I say probably,\nbecause you look at me and\n\n139\n00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,645\nsay well, I'm supposed to\nbe a subject matter expert.\n\n140\n00:08:11,645 --> 00:08:14,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you're like probably, you know.\n\n141\n00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,208\nI can hear one of my commanders just\nyelling at me, telling me [LAUGH]\n\n142\n00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:18,798\n>> Right.\n\n143\n00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,338\n[LAUGH] Like, don't you know?!\n\n144\n00:08:20,338 --> 00:08:22,765\n>> So, I-\n>> But\n\n145\n00:08:22,765 --> 00:08:24,760\nit is a little bit of a gray area there.\n\n146\n00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,987\nAnd as you said, those are probably good\nterms we need to be familiar with because\n\n147\n00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:31,274\nyou do have passive footprinting, and\nthen you have active footprinting, right?\n\n148\n00:08:31,274 --> 00:08:35,124\n>> Yeah, where you start more\naggressively engaging the target.\n\n149\n00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:39,744\nAnd you're gonna hear me say that a lot\nthroughout this whole course of CEH.\n\n150\n00:08:39,744 --> 00:08:42,455\nYou're gonna hear me talk about more\naggressively engaging the target.\n\n151\n00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:47,703\nAnd you need to keep in mind that when\nyou start more aggressively pushing in,\n\n152\n00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:50,870\nyou're starting to cross\nthose legal areas.\n\n153\n00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,914\nBut if you're sitting there\npassively soliciting information,\n\n154\n00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:56,509\nit's probably not that.\n\n155\n00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,680\nIt's probably not something that's\ngoing to get you in trouble.\n\n156\n00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,660\nAnd to kind of focus on the probably\nportion of it, it's not just me\n\n157\n00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,390\nflaking out trying to like, oh well,\ndisclaimer, or anything like that.\n\n158\n00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,010\nIt's a case of,\nI know we have people all over the place,\n\n159\n00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,290\nand we're not just\ntalking to a US audience.\n\n160\n00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,900\nWe're talking to people\nall around the world.\n\n161\n00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,820\nLaws change.\n\n162\n00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:24,030\nI am not an expert here on laws in the US.\n\n163\n00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,560\nThat's not my specialty.\n\n164\n00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,720\nSo I'm sure as heck not going to be\na specialist on the law in Singapore or\n\n165\n00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,660\nthe UK or anything like that.\n\n166\n00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,340\nSo you probably need to check your\nlocal laws if you're really concerned.\n\n167\n00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,450\nI'm not the one to go to for that.\n\n168\n00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,540\nSo that's a whole nother area.\n\n169\n00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,315\nBut I'm just kinda putting it\nout there that there could,\n\n170\n00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:51,380\nthat probably it is legal and\nI know the stuff,\n\n171\n00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,263\na lot of the stuff we talk about\nhere is just fine and legal to do.\n\n172\n00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:59,325\nBut if you're someplace else, you might\nwant to check to see what local laws and\n\n173\n00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:02,785\ncustoms are,\nto see if that is legal or not.\n\n174\n00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:03,750\n>> Yeah, very good point.\n\n175\n00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,665\nCuz at this phase, you might very well\nwant to stay on the legal side of things.\n\n176\n00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:13,085\nAnd you need to be familiar with\nwhat's legal and not, in your area.\n\n177\n00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:15,788\n>> Yeah, and\nhaving a get out of jail free card,\n\n178\n00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:18,087\nas we mentioned in a previous lesson.\n\n179\n00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:18,880\n>> Yes.\n\n180\n00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,096\n>> Having a get out of jail free\ncard isn't going to help you when\n\n181\n00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:21,800\nyou break the law.\n\n182\n00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,170\nYou can't get a get out of jail\nfree card for breaking the law.\n\n183\n00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:26,690\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n184\n00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,920\n>> I can't get a note from my mom and\n\n185\n00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,330\nshow the police officer.\n\n186\n00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,630\nIt says, it's okay,\nshe said I could speed.\n\n187\n00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:32,490\nI got a note.\n\n188\n00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,210\nAin't gonna work.\n\n189\n00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,959\n>> He's such a nice boy, [LAUGH].\n\n190\n00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,265\n>> Yeah, so they're just gonna say,\nyeah, look at this.\n\n191\n00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,140\nThey're gonna say,\nwe don't know what you did, but\n\n192\n00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,300\nwe know it's illegal, so\nwe'll just take you in to figure it out.\n\n193\n00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,274\nSo, that's something you need to think\nabout is even if you have permission to do\n\n194\n00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:54,029\nit, you have permission to bust into\nsomeone's stuff and get information,\n\n195\n00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,340\nyou don't,\ncan't get permission to break the law.\n\n196\n00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,599\nI suppose you could in some cases, but\n\n197\n00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:03,200\nthat's not something that\nwe're gonna worry about here.\n\n198\n00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,210\nSo, really kinda look to see\nwhere you might fall on it.\n\n199\n00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,840\nFor the most part,\nI wouldn't worry about it too much.\n\n200\n00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,850\nBut you might want to look into it if\nyou're really, really, really concerned.\n\n201\n00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,311\n>> And in the end, I think most of us can\nuse common sense which I guess is not\n\n202\n00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,094\nreally all that common sometimes.\n\n203\n00:11:23,094 --> 00:11:25,460\n[LAUGH] But\nif you're doing a Google search and\n\n204\n00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,560\nyou're getting results in a web page and\nyou're clicking on a link and\n\n205\n00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,500\nyou're reading information\nabout this company.\n\n206\n00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,710\nOr you're on Monster or something and\n\n207\n00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,100\nreading information about jobs that they\nhave available, obviously not illegal.\n\n208\n00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,640\nIf you're connecting into their server,\ntrying to convince\n\n209\n00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,934\none of their users to give you a password,\nso you can get into their system,\n\n210\n00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:47,510\nyeah, that's when we might\nbe crossing the line, right?\n\n211\n00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,740\nSo, we can kind of use common sense there.\n\n212\n00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,416\n>> Exactly, use your best judgement\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n213\n00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,736\n>> Another way of looking at footprinting\nis, it's okay to drive by and take a look\n\n214\n00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:04,880\nat someone's house, but it's not okay to\ngo and break in to it, that's illegal.\n\n215\n00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,170\n>> And trying to plot out where all their\nsafes are and things like that, yeah, no.\n\n216\n00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,225\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, there's magnitudes of difference,\n\n217\n00:12:10,225 --> 00:12:12,035\nor worlds of difference there.\n\n218\n00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:16,070\nSo, use your best judgement.\n\n219\n00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,630\nSomething I would also put in here,\nthat I could say,\n\n220\n00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:27,220\nthat could actually change the nature of\nthe game, is always double check stuff.\n\n221\n00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,020\nYou know, where you're\ngathering information from, or\n\n222\n00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,210\nwho you're gathering information from.\n\n223\n00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:36,741\nI've seen some people do the foot printing\nprocess and gather information, and\n\n224\n00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:38,750\nthey didn't double check things.\n\n225\n00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,516\nAnd the foot printing process,\nsince it was done wrong,\n\n226\n00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:49,115\nthe stuff that followed after went\ndown that path to the

yet, but if you're doing\na test where you have no knowledge\n\n239\n00:13:19,772 --> 00:13:23,900\nof the company, you're starting from\nscratch, you've got the wrong range.\n\n240\n00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,840\nSo now your get out of jail free\ncard doesn't do you a whole lot of\n\n241\n00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,740\ngood because that's with\na different organization.\n\n242\n00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,540\n>> Yeah.\n\n243\n00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,780\nAnd even if they let you off the hook,\nthat's a royal screw up.\n\n244\n00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,530\nAnd I could use some\nharsher language than that.\n\n245\n00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,661\nI won't.\nBut that's,\n\n246\n00:13:38,661 --> 00:13:42,075\njust to say it's a royal screw up,\nI don't think that's enough.\n\n247\n00:13:42,075 --> 00:13:48,345\nSo double check things and\nmake sure you're on the right track.\n\n248\n00:13:49,635 --> 00:13:54,145\nAs the saying goes, what,\nmeasure twice and cut once.\n\n249\n00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,485\nIt's not bad to do that.\n\n250\n00:13:55,485 --> 00:14:00,455\nEveryone makes mistakes, just try not\nto be one of them as much as possible.\n\n251\n00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,830\n>> So if we had to set some expectations\nfor our footprinting process,\n\n252\n00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,140\nwhen we say expectations, what we\nthink we should be getting out of it?\n\n253\n00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,880\n>> Yeah,\nI do want to set some expectations here.\n\n254\n00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,280\nLike what information could\nwe expect reasonably to get.\n\n255\n00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,150\nRemember one of the things that\nI had put out there early on\n\n256\n00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,615\nin the lessons we're doing\nis that when information you\n\n257\n00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:34,670\ngather from one phase carries\nthrough into the next.\n\n258\n00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,140\nSo, when we want to make sure that we\nset the right expectations on what\n\n259\n00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,090\nwe need to have at the end to\ncarry on into that next phase.\n\n260\n00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,430\nSo when we look at\nexpectations of things to get,\n\n261\n00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,050\nwhat could you reasonably\nexpect to have in hand?\n\n262\n00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,490\nYou could expect to have\ninformation on personnel.\n\n263\n00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,330\nYou might even have names of personnel.\n\n264\n00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,740\nSo you know how many people\nthey have there, but\n\n265\n00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,940\nyou have specific names of\npeople that are key individuals.\n\n266\n00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,400\nExpect to have information about\nthe company target itself.\n\n267\n00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,320\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many places\nyou can get that information from.\n\n268\n00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,450\nIf they're a publicly traded company,\nversus a private company.\n\n269\n00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,520\nEven that can change the type\nof information you can get.\n\n270\n00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,128\nBut you can always get some information.\n\n271\n00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:26,490\nSo expect to get information on the\ncompany, what it does, learn their lingo.\n\n272\n00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,520\nYou know, really get down to it.\n\n273\n00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:34,860\nWhen I say you're getting information on\nthe company, if you're someone who perhaps\n\n274\n00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,460\nhas done things like a stock investing,\nit's interestingly enough.\n\n275\n00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,790\nIf you've ever done any\ninvesting in stocks.\n\n276\n00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,590\nPeople that invest in stocks,\nif they're smart about it,\n\n277\n00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,960\nwill do research on the people\nthey're giving their money to, right?\n\n278\n00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,090\n>> [LAUGH] Hopefully.\n\n279\n00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,710\n>> Yes, I would hope so.\n\n280\n00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,776\nIf you're doing something like that, or\n\n281\n00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:57,140\nif you have done something like that\nthose same skills will serve you\n\n282\n00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,870\nquite well because it is\nreally kind of the same thing.\n\n283\n00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,232\nExcept, we're not dumping\nmoney into them at the end.\n\n284\n00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:04,589\nWe are doing background research on them.\n\n285\n00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,882\nSo all those things that you do there you\ncan carry that you're already here if\n\n286\n00:16:07,882 --> 00:16:08,752\nyou have done that.\n\n287\n00:16:08,752 --> 00:16:13,359\nIf you haven't it's not a bad\nidea to say look at a book or\n\n288\n00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:18,667\nsomething on that, to kind of\nlearn how you do research on them.\n\n289\n00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,801\nNot necessarily on the financial part,\nbut how you can,\n\n290\n00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,899\nwhere you can find information from.\n\n291\n00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,464\nAnd we're gonna actually tap into\nsome of those resources here.\n\n292\n00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:26,999\n>> Awesome.\n\n293\n00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,919\n>> So we have that about the company,\n\n294\n00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,840\nthen we also have technical information\nas something to think about.\n\n295\n00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,251\nI'm sure there's a lot of you out\nthere thinking about what technical\n\n296\n00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:39,055\ninformation you could get.\n\n297\n00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:43,703\nWell, without hacking, there's probably\nsomething I should put as a footnote in\n\n298\n00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,363\nthere, how much you can get\nwithout hacking into it.\n\n299\n00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:47,163\n>> We're trying to stay\nlegal at this point, right?\n\n300\n00:16:47,163 --> 00:16:48,302\n>> Yeah.\n>> We're doing our footprinting,\n\n301\n00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:48,939\nour passive footprinting.\n\n302\n00:16:48,939 --> 00:16:49,836\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n303\n00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:51,564\nwe haven't stepped over\nto that side of it yet.\n\n304\n00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:53,531\n>> Yep.\n>> So, what can you get?\n\n305\n00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:55,180\nWe can definitely get DNS information.\n\n306\n00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,161\n>> Right.\n>> Easy.\n\n307\n00:16:56,161 --> 00:16:59,295\n>> As in like who their DNS servers are or\nwho's hosting their DNS?\n\n308\n00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:01,713\n>> And way beyond that, way beyond that.\n\n309\n00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:04,689\nWe can figure out,\nwe can get domain name registrations,\n\n310\n00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,655\nwe can get ownership of domain names.\n\n311\n00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:10,814\nBut then we can get mail server\ninformation, that's easy to get and\n\n312\n00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,730\nthat's probably available to get.\n\n313\n00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,337\n>> And it's not like they can hide that,\nright?\n\n314\n00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:17,420\nBecause their company needs to\nreceive email from the outside world.\n\n315\n00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,315\nSo, somehow my machine needs to be\nable to resolve their domain name into\n\n316\n00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:24,095\na MX record and find that.\n\n317\n00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:25,366\n>> Yeah, you hit the nail on the head.\n\n318\n00:17:25,366 --> 00:17:28,119\nThat right there is not illegal,\n\n319\n00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,257\nyou pulled their MX record\nto get technical data.\n\n320\n00:17:32,257 --> 00:17:34,548\nThat's not illegal,\nthat has to be out there.\n\n321\n00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:37,907\nSo if they didn't want it then just\nunplug all your servers and go home\n\n322\n00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:39,184\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n323\n00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,725\n>> Go run and ice cream shop or something,\n\n324\n00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:41,801\nbecause this is,\n\n325\n00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:45,050\nif you're gonna be getting emails\nthen that's the way it's gonna work.\n\n326\n00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:49,689\nSo, we have those, and you can IP ranges.\n\n327\n00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:50,211\n>> Right.\n\n328\n00:17:50,211 --> 00:17:53,288\n>> You can get ISP information for sure.\n\n329\n00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:57,409\nI can get web server information\nwithout busting into anything.\n\n330\n00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,677\nThat's very, very easy to get.\n\n331\n00:18:00,677 --> 00:18:04,483\n>> When you say information about their\nweb server, like what their using to host\n\n332\n00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,668\nthat website whether it's IIS or\nApache, and things like that.\n\n333\n00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:09,502\n>> And the operating system underneath it.\n\n334\n00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:10,758\n>> And the operating system\nthat's hosting that, right.\n\n335\n00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:14,319\n>> So, and if you roll that in with\nsomething that I was mentioning in\n\n336\n00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,742\na previous lesson about\nyour platform knowledge.\n\n337\n00:18:16,742 --> 00:18:17,374\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n338\n00:18:17,374 --> 00:18:20,483\n>> I mean it's one thing\nto rely on websites and\n\n339\n00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:23,014\ntools to pull information for you.\n\n340\n00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,473\nBut, if you have that platform knowledge,\nand\n\n341\n00:18:25,473 --> 00:18:29,284\none of the things I'm gonna show you\nlater on in this series of lessons with\n\n342\n00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:32,559\nfootprinting is how that platform\nknowledge comes into play.\n\n343\n00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,548\nIt's because you look at this stuff and\nyou'll say,\n\n344\n00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:39,838\nokay well that doesn't quite line\nup with what it's telling me.\n\n345\n00:18:39,838 --> 00:18:44,305\nYour platform knowledge steps in and says\nI can now kind of break through that and\n\n346\n00:18:44,305 --> 00:18:46,046\nsee exactly what's going on.\n\n347\n00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:50,592\nSo that's the type of\nstuff we are trying to do.\n\n348\n00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:54,470\nSo you have that technical data,\nyou can do things like traceroutes,\n\n349\n00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:58,825\nyou can do things like check on the\nregistrars to get additional information.\n\n350\n00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:02,330\nI mean there's a lot out there you can do.\n\n351\n00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:06,279\nYou can harvest email addresses,\nyou can download websites\n\n352\n00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:10,317\ninterestingly enough you can do that,\nso quite a few things.\n\n353\n00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:14,154\nThen we also have things\nlike learning about policy.\n\n354\n00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,794\nAnd learning what their employees do,\n\n355\n00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:20,476\nwhat types of interactions\nthey have with the public.\n\n356\n00:19:20,476 --> 00:19:25,556\nThat could be another great area that\nyou can go and get information out.\n\n357\n00:19:25,556 --> 00:19:31,206\nWhen you're done with this phase,\nyou should expect to have what information\n\n358\n00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:37,128\ncollected in some sort of report or\nformat that you can easily go back to.\n\n359\n00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:41,360\nOne of the things that has been mentioned\nup to this point, which we have to mention\n\n360\n00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,485\nnow, is when you gather this information,\nyou really kinda gotta be organized.\n\n361\n00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:50,042\nOne of the things you have to learn is you\nhave to have some organizational system of\n\n362\n00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,468\nfiguring out how you're gonna\nsort through all this stuff.\n\n363\n00:19:53,468 --> 00:19:56,492\nYou are gonna get a wealth of\ninformation when you do this.\n\n364\n00:19:56,492 --> 00:20:00,143\nAnd so what you wanna do is\nhave some way to organize it.\n\n365\n00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:03,065\nBecause I can guarantee during\nthe footprinting phase you're\n\n366\n00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,007\ngonna gather a lot.\n\n367\n00:20:04,007 --> 00:20:06,013\nAnd I'm gonna show you over\na whole course of the CEH,\n\n368\n00:20:06,013 --> 00:20:09,270\nhow I'm gonna keep saying remember\nhow we did this during footprinting?\n\n369\n00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,456\nAnd there you go, a light will come\non going yeah, I do remember that.\n\n370\n00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:13,675\nYou'll do the same thing in the field.\n\n371\n00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:16,513\nYou'll look back at this stuff and\nsay well, yeah,\n\n372\n00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:19,167\nthere was something that\ncould help me out here.\n\n373\n00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:24,534\nAnd so once you have that It's\ngood to latch onto it and\n\n374\n00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:28,246\nbe able to go back and get it later on.\n\n375\n00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:32,989\nSo start thinking about an organizational\nprocess, that you can use if you're\n\n376\n00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:36,762\ngoing to be a pen tester,\nhow you're going to keep track of it.\n\n377\n00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:39,955\nAnd I don't care if it's on paper,\nI don't care if it's digital, but\n\n378\n00:20:39,955 --> 00:20:41,298\nyou have to have a way to do it.\n\n379\n00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:45,647\nAlso remember,\nwhen you're doing something like this,\n\n380\n00:20:45,647 --> 00:20:50,540\nyou have to, you're gotta be organized for\nanother big reason.\n\n381\n00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,270\nYou just can't hand a bug.\n\n382\n00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,935\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You go up to your client and\n\n383\n00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:58,614\ngo into your pocket going hey,\nhere's some scraps of paper that I have.\n\n384\n00:20:58,614 --> 00:21:00,868\nAnd I've seen people do that.\n\n385\n00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,946\nNot necessarily in this field but\nI've seen people do that.\n\n386\n00:21:02,946 --> 00:21:03,544\n>> Right.\n\n387\n00:21:03,544 --> 00:21:06,865\nSo not only for yourself.\n\n388\n00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,809\nYou've got to be organized so\nyou can go back in and\n\n389\n00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,538\nretrieve the information when you need it.\n\n390\n00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:12,331\nBut, yeah, you've got deliverables.\n\n391\n00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:14,840\nYou're getting paid to do\nthis by some organization,\n\n392\n00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,109\nand they dang sure don't want you to\njust open open up your briefcase and\n\n393\n00:21:18,109 --> 00:21:19,649\ndump a bunch of papers out there.\n\n394\n00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:22,453\nYou wanna have nice polished reports and\nthings like that,\n\n395\n00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:26,005\nmake it worth all that money you're\ngonna be charging them as a pin tester.\n\n396\n00:21:26,005 --> 00:21:28,336\n>> Exactly.\n\n397\n00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:30,484\nFunny enough,\nI had a friend that did that once and\n\n398\n00:21:30,484 --> 00:21:32,134\nwhile I won't say where but did that.\n\n399\n00:21:32,134 --> 00:21:34,440\nSomeone asked him, was like,\ndo you have that list of names?\n\n400\n00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,077\nHe's like yeah.\n\n401\n00:21:35,077 --> 00:21:37,742\nHe goes in there, pulls it out, and the\nguy holds his hand out to grab the piece\n\n402\n00:21:37,742 --> 00:21:39,666\nof paper and he dumps the slips of paper.\n\n403\n00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That were literally torn off in there\n\n404\n00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,444\nand some were on post-it notes and\ndumps it in there.\n\n405\n00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:46,450\nThe guy was like, you're joking, right?\n\n406\n00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,088\nSeriously?\n\n407\n00:21:47,088 --> 00:21:50,095\n>> You expect to get\na paycheck when this is over?\n\n408\n00:21:50,095 --> 00:21:51,512\n>> I was like, I don't know you man.\n\n409\n00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:52,632\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm looking over here.\n\n410\n00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:56,719\nSo, it's not something that's\noutside the realm of possibility.\n\n411\n00:21:56,719 --> 00:22:00,004\nThere are some people they are like,\nreally?\n\n412\n00:22:00,004 --> 00:22:04,150\nSo you do have to organize\nit not only to go back for\n\n413\n00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,195\nyourself but to report it later on.\n\n414\n00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:11,575\nAnd then there's the third reason why you\nwant to organize this disk to kind of back\n\n415\n00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:12,094\nthat in.\n\n416\n00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:13,514\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can't just go and\n\n417\n00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:15,773\nbust into someone's system and\ndo all this stuff.\n\n418\n00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:19,277\nI mean you have to document everything\nyou do through the whole process,\n\n419\n00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:20,540\nnot just this.\n\n420\n00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,638\nIs that you have to document that because\nyou have to clean up after yourself\n\n421\n00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:23,217\nwhen you're done.\n\n422\n00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,227\nYou just can't go and\nhack into someone's system, and\n\n423\n00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:28,196\ngoing oh look at the time I'm done, get\nmy check and I'm out, you can't do that.\n\n424\n00:22:28,196 --> 00:22:29,986\nYou have to clean up after yourself,\n\n425\n00:22:29,986 --> 00:22:33,638\nyou can't just leave someones system\nin a vulnerable state, you do that.\n\n426\n00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:37,342\nDon't care how well you did in your\npen test, you failed miserably.\n\n427\n00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:39,610\n>> And so,\nif you don't document what you've done,\n\n428\n00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,470\nit becomes difficult to undo all of that.\n\n429\n00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,208\n>> Yeah, it's like, what did I do?\n\n430\n00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,462\nYou're gonna be doing a lot.\n\n431\n00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,099\n>> Right.\n\n432\n00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,049\n>> So, you need to really\nthink about documenting stuff.\n\n433\n00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:54,436\nStart really kind of thinking of an\norganizational process that works for you.\n\n434\n00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:57,837\nThere's no real template for\nit even though some people claim there is.\n\n435\n00:22:57,837 --> 00:23:02,605\nThere's no real template for it, so you do\nactually have a, some latitude on that.\n\n436\n00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:06,213\nAnd just for the record, it's not being\ntested on the CEH, that's a tip from me to\n\n437\n00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:08,583\nyou professionally,\nsomething that you want to do.\n\n438\n00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:12,083\n>> There you go, personal tips from Mr.\nSean Oriyano.\n\n439\n00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:12,883\nI like it.\n\n440\n00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:14,293\n[LAUGH]\n>> I approve this message.\n\n441\n00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,740\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n442\n00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,543\nwe set our expectations of what we want\nto gain out of this footprinting process.\n\n443\n00:23:21,543 --> 00:23:25,366\nAnd one of the things that Sean mentioned\nis that we really want to keep in mind\n\n444\n00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:28,892\nthat the information we gather here\nis gonna feed into the next phase of\n\n445\n00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:29,642\nour process.\n\n446\n00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:31,266\nSo we get an idea of what we want so\n\n447\n00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:34,179\nthat we're gonna be able to\ncarry out those next phases.\n\n448\n00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:39,537\nWe set our goals and so\nwhere do we go from there?\n\n449\n00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:44,239\n>> Well, you have the expectations.\n\n450\n00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:47,506\nI look at expectations and goal setting.\n\n451\n00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:52,676\nThere's two things that you can look at,\ntheir expectations.\n\n452\n00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:53,796\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n453\n00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:58,068\n>> We could sit here and spend the next\ntwo weeks just talking about things we can\n\n454\n00:23:58,068 --> 00:23:59,880\ngather through footprinting.\n\n455\n00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,960\n>> You guys want to do that?\n\n456\n00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,420\n>> Yeah, let's go for\nit, let's rock and roll.\n\n457\n00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,420\n>> [LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n458\n00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,870\n>> No sleep either.\n\n459\n00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:12,875\n[LAUGH] So yeah, you could spend\na lot of time gathering information.\n\n460\n00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:16,327\nYou can sit there and sit there and sit\nthere but some time you gotta, you gotta\n\n461\n00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:20,270\nfigure out when you're gonna, when\nyou're okay to move on to the next step.\n\n462\n00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,125\nA lot of times that comes with experience.\n\n463\n00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:27,963\nYou're gonna figure out, okay, I've got\ninformation that I can work with to\n\n464\n00:24:27,963 --> 00:24:31,350\nmove on to that scanning phase and\nsubsequent phases.\n\n465\n00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,055\nI've got enough.\n\n466\n00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:39,190\nBut, you should be figuring out\nwhat you're gonna expect to get.\n\n467\n00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,700\nSet goals on, hey, I gotta have\nat least this much information,\n\n468\n00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,350\nbefore I can move on to another phase.\n\n469\n00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,400\nYeah, it's great I can have all this, but\n\n470\n00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,710\nif I have this,\nthat's enough to continue on.\n\n471\n00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,470\nHaving all this,\n\n472\n00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:57,170\nunless I can get it really easily,\nwell then I'm just going to.\n\n473\n00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,580\nIf I can't get it easily I'm just going to\naccept this much for right now and go on.\n\n474\n00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:06,770\nOkay, so that's just to keep you\nfrom really spending a lot of time,\n\n475\n00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:11,424\nor even wasting a lot of time in\ngetting something that might be\n\n476\n00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,840\ndiminishing goals or diminishing results.\n\n477\n00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,375\nYou may not need all that information.\n\n478\n00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:20,933\n>> So we say expectations and what we\nwould like to or expect to get out of this\n\n479\n00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:25,590\nprocess, but goals are what I need to\nmeet before I move onto the next one.\n\n480\n00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,409\nAnd I might get, I might reach my\ngoals early on in the process or\n\n481\n00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:31,602\nit might take me a long time and\na lot of gathering to hit those goals, and\n\n482\n00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:35,251\nthen once I hit the goals I've got enough\ninformation to move on to my next phase.\n\n483\n00:25:35,251 --> 00:25:36,126\n>> Exactly.\n>> Nice.\n\n484\n00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:37,750\nOkay.\n\n485\n00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,791\nAll right, so what kind of information\nare we talking about then?\n\n486\n00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:43,861\nWe kinda talked a little\nbit about DNS information,\n\n487\n00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:48,960\nMX information, what IP address range is,\nnames of employees.\n\n488\n00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,666\nName dropping is always good.\n\n489\n00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:52,501\n>> Yeah, there's so much.\n\n490\n00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:56,128\nYeah, when you start learning\nabout your target, and Laurie,\n\n491\n00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:59,553\nabout the company part,\nsomething I always like to stress is\n\n492\n00:25:59,553 --> 00:26:04,410\ninformation you should look for is kind\nwhat you're talking about, is that jargon.\n\n493\n00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,840\nThat can be very handy when\nyou do social engineering.\n\n494\n00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,150\nYou'd be surprised at how much\ntraction you can get in the company.\n\n495\n00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,290\nMaybe you aren't, but\n\n496\n00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,780\nyou can get a lot of traction with people\nif you know to speak their language.\n\n497\n00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,880\nIf you can speak their language\nthey'll immediately start\n\n498\n00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,010\noffering you stuff in a lot of cases.\n\n499\n00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,340\nOffering up information because you\nwouldn't know that unless you were on\n\n500\n00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,980\nthe same level with me.\n\n501\n00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,760\nYou learn their lingo,\ntheir jargon, the way they talk.\n\n502\n00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,650\nEven if you don't know\nwhat that stuff means,\n\n503\n00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:38,160\na lot of times just getting\nthe right context is enough.\n\n504\n00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,990\nYou might be able to\nmention a project name.\n\n505\n00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,890\nI've done that,\nwhere I've mentioned a project name.\n\n506\n00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,833\nI had no idea what the project was,\nbut I talked to somebody,\n\n507\n00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:49,990\ngot a rapport with them mention a project\nname, oh yeah that's blah, blah, blah and\n\n508\n00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,168\nthat's the project name and context of it.\n\n509\n00:26:52,168 --> 00:26:56,389\nYou know it, of course I know it,\nthen they start talking about it, yeah,\n\n510\n00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:59,080\nit's behind schedule and blah, blah, blah.\n\n511\n00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,291\nThey spill their life story to you.\n\n512\n00:27:01,291 --> 00:27:06,708\nSo, it's good to really\nlearn those things.\n\n513\n00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,242\nAnd like I said, you have the stuff\nwhere you interact with people,\n\n514\n00:27:10,242 --> 00:27:14,030\nyou have the technical information and\nyou have administrative stuff.\n\n515\n00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:17,740\nTry to learn that information\nwherever possible.\n\n516\n00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,333\nI know I'm painting with a pretty broad\nbrush, heck I got a roller out right now.\n\n517\n00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,374\n[LAUGH] And what I'm actually,\nwhat I'm saying you could do, but\n\n518\n00:27:25,374 --> 00:27:27,541\nthere's a lot of\ninformation you can gather.\n\n519\n00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:29,958\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n520\n00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:31,440\nAll right, so let's see.\n\n521\n00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,030\nSo passive versus active,\nwe kinda hinted that that,\n\n522\n00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:35,760\nwhat else do we want to say about that?\n\n523\n00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:41,540\n>> We go, to be simple with this,\nyour footprint is gonna be done and\n\n524\n00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,230\nI kinda look at it two sub-phases.\n\n525\n00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,990\nWe've got the footprinting phase and\n\n526\n00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:49,560\nthen we could divide that up where we have\nthe passive part and the active part.\n\n527\n00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:55,465\nPassive means you're not doing any real\nsort of engagement with the target.\n\n528\n00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,375\nYou're just gathering from public sources.\n\n529\n00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,166\nYou're not doing anything\nto really tamper with them.\n\n530\n00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:02,457\nAnd we're trying to delay\nthat as long as possible,\n\n531\n00:28:02,457 --> 00:28:06,458\nbecause the more you start to engage the\ntarget, the more they know you're coming.\n\n532\n00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,750\nSo we want to kind of\nminimize the active part.\n\n533\n00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,666\nAt some point, though,\nyou do have to go active on this.\n\n534\n00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:15,670\nAnd that's where you start doing\nthe social engineering, stuff like that.\n\n535\n00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,490\nAnd even then you wanna minimize\nthe active stuff for as long as possible.\n\n536\n00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:20,510\nAt some point you have to.\n\n537\n00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,859\nBut you wanna minimize it because I\ndon't want them having any red flags or\n\n538\n00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:29,083\nanything coming to mind saying that,\nhey, something's happening.\n\n539\n00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,151\n>> Yeah,\ncuz until we get that active phase,\n\n540\n00:28:31,151 --> 00:28:34,300\nwe really don't run a big\nrisk of alerting the target.\n\n541\n00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,637\nOnce we hit that active phase, now we have\nto be concerned with the fact that we\n\n542\n00:28:38,637 --> 00:28:42,712\nmight do something that trips some\nkind of intrusion detection system or\n\n543\n00:28:42,712 --> 00:28:43,875\nsome kind of alarm.\n\n544\n00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:47,841\nOr, somebody raises a question, says, why\nis this guy asking all these questions or\n\n545\n00:28:47,841 --> 00:28:50,334\npacing my building off, or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n546\n00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:51,583\nAnd then we start getting caught.\n\n547\n00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:53,816\n>> Yeah, I don't want them,\nno pun intended,\n\n548\n00:28:53,816 --> 00:28:56,458\nI don't want to put any\nshields up on me or anything.\n\n549\n00:28:56,458 --> 00:29:00,583\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry.\n\n550\n00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:03,791\nSo I don't want them\nputting any shields up.\n\n551\n00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,833\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] [APPLAUSE]\n\n552\n00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:06,541\n>> So, but-\n\n553\n00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,042\n>> He says in his best James T Kirk voice.\n\n554\n00:29:09,042 --> 00:29:13,573\n[LAUGH]\n>> So what I wanna do is I want to delay\n\n555\n00:29:13,573 --> 00:29:18,049\nthat as much as possible because once\nthey do put those shields up and\n\n556\n00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:21,260\ntheir defences start getting more alert.\n\n557\n00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,220\nIt becomes much harder for me.\n\n558\n00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,550\nAlways act like you might be detected or\nmight be watched.\n\n559\n00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:33,875\nSo keep that quiet stealthy that's going.\n\n560\n00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,620\n>> So, in the end,\nwhy is this stuff so easy to get in?\n\n561\n00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,137\nWhy is it that we can just go out there,\n\n562\n00:29:40,137 --> 00:29:45,041\nusing simple tools, use this information\nand start my hacking process?\n\n563\n00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:48,680\n>> You know,\nthere's many factors that come into play.\n\n564\n00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:55,460\nFirst of all, if your pen testing\na company, companies want to be seen.\n\n565\n00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,580\nThere's very few companies\nthat exist not to be seen.\n\n566\n00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,980\nThey do exist, but that's not too many.\n\n567\n00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,380\nI have literally had people come in,\none guy in particular came in my classes.\n\n568\n00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,360\nWe started doing the introductions.\n\n569\n00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,780\nWhat company do you work for?\n\n570\n00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,530\nDidn't want to talk about it.\n\n571\n00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,100\nThat was it.\n\n572\n00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,490\nAnd you're like okay, don't wanna get up\nin your business or anything like that.\n\n573\n00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,900\nThat was his thing, but\nonce he got a comfort level,\n\n574\n00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,670\nhe talked a little bit about it, but\nit was still kept very, very hush hush.\n\n575\n00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,960\nThe name of the company wouldn't even tell\nyou what they did, wouldn't give it away.\n\n576\n00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,840\nYou couldn't look it up or anything.\n\n577\n00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,318\nSo, it's a very big deal for\ncompanies to be,\n\n578\n00:30:41,318 --> 00:30:45,960\nyou know, to be publicly accessible.\n\n579\n00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,479\n>> Yeah.\n>> You want to be found,\n\n580\n00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,708\nI want to make money.\n\n581\n00:30:48,708 --> 00:30:49,542\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n582\n00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,520\nI want people to find my website,\nI want people to buy my product.\n\n583\n00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,400\nWe want to make money.\n\n584\n00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,040\nAnd if I try to stay hidden and hide\nall that, then I don't make any money.\n\n585\n00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,230\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n586\n00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,740\nSo that's one part of it.\n\n587\n00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,610\nOther things we have is that you get\n\n588\n00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,580\npeople nowadays with social\nnetworking is a really good thing.\n\n589\n00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,740\nPeople love talking about themselves and\nwhat they've done and everything.\n\n590\n00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,000\nPeople will still literally tweet\nabout their breakfast all the time, so\n\n591\n00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,150\nokay we've done this, this, and this.\n\n592\n00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,150\n>> It's amazing, isn't it?\n\n593\n00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,040\n>> It's like realizing you\nput something out there,\n\n594\n00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,530\nnot everyone needs to know that.\n\n595\n00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:25,110\n>> Right.\n>> I don't care that you had eggs for\n\n596\n00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,740\nbreakfast.\n\n597\n00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,680\n>> Yeah.\n>> I don't know, there's that and\n\n598\n00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,660\nthen there's just people that\ndon't know how to use technology.\n\n599\n00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,333\nTechnology or\ndon't think about when using technology.\n\n600\n00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:38,310\nYou have things like smartphones and other\ndevices that people are going crazy with.\n\n601\n00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,254\nOne of the things I read in\nUSA Today not too long ago was,\n\n602\n00:31:41,254 --> 00:31:43,458\nit was actually literally two weeks ago.\n\n603\n00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:47,315\nWhere people are starting to go back to,\nsome of these people are going back to old\n\n604\n00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:51,900\ncell phones because they don't have GPS in\nthem and they don't want to get tracked.\n\n605\n00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,341\nIt's like, well, you could turn off\nthe GPS in that device, you know?\n\n606\n00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:59,363\nAnd meanwhile the picture of the person\nthey're showing that's making a big deal\n\n607\n00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:02,251\nabout using one of these little flip\nphones with the GPS, the guys driving some\n\n608\n00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:04,585\nthing with the OnStar system on it\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n609\n00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:05,272\n>> It's like,\n\n610\n00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:08,215\nyou didn't think your clever plan through,\nyou know.\n\n611\n00:32:08,215 --> 00:32:10,985\nYou can see this guy going, oh,\nI got one over on everybody.\n\n612\n00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:12,000\nAnd like, no, you didn't.\n\n613\n00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,600\nNo you didn't.\n\n614\n00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,890\n>> Not so much.\n\n615\n00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,480\n>> And besides they can triangulate\nyou off of towers anyway.\n\n616\n00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,100\nYou don't wanna get tracked,\nthrow the cell phone out the window, and\n\n617\n00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,280\ndrive an old Datsun from the 80s.\n\n618\n00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,196\nYou're getting better.\n\n619\n00:32:22,196 --> 00:32:27,180\nSo that's really it,\nthose are some of the reasons.\n\n620\n00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,430\nI can go into numerous reasons.\n\n621\n00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,540\nSince I won't, but\ninformation just freely available.\n\n622\n00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,080\nAnd a lot of these systems,\nyou look at the Internet for\n\n623\n00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,780\nexample, internet was never\ndesigned with security in mind.\n\n624\n00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,050\nIt was designed to share information.\n\n625\n00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,990\nYou look at the history of it,\n\n626\n00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:44,400\nit was scientists that want to\nshare research information.\n\n627\n00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,010\nThey didn't want to say okay, well you can\nhave it, you can have it, you can have it,\n\n628\n00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,940\nbut I don't like you, so go wherever.\n\n629\n00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,100\nThey didn't do that sort of thing.\n\n630\n00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,480\n>> Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\n631\n00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,210\n>> So just remember that.\n\n632\n00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,600\n>> So it's just all out there.\n\n633\n00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,340\nAnd some of it even goes\nback to the fact that\n\n634\n00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,510\nthe whole concept of security\nis not new but relatively new.\n\n635\n00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,400\nThey were admins that didn't\nknow what they were doing.\n\n636\n00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,872\nAnd people put amazing stuff,\n\n637\n00:33:07,872 --> 00:33:11,830\nI think one of the guests in the chat\nroom mentioned the wayback machine.\n\n638\n00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,300\nAnd you can go back to some of\nthese companies' websites, and\n\n639\n00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,340\nback before they knew what they were\ndoing they put all kinds of information.\n\n640\n00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,630\nThat really did need to be available\nto the public on their website.\n\n641\n00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,700\nSo, I hope we're changing,\na lot of that is changing.\n\n642\n00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,180\nPeople are getting a little smarter about\nwhat they make available publicly but\n\n643\n00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:32,050\nas Sean said, you can't hide it all\nbecause you have to be discoverable so\n\n644\n00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:32,570\nyou can make money.\n\n645\n00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,213\nAll right, well looking at the clock,\nit's about time for us to take our break.\n\n646\n00:33:37,213 --> 00:33:41,530\nSo when we come back we're gonna\ngo into what we call open-source\n\n647\n00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,270\nintelligent gathering.\n\n648\n00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:46,610\nSo Sean's gonna do some demos for\nus and show us\n\n649\n00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,440\nsome the data that we can pull back,\nall these stuff we've been talking about.\n\n650\n00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,697\nSo stay tuned and we'll be back soon.\n\n651\n00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:58,297\n[SOUND].\n\n652\n00:33:58,297 --> 00:34:00,218\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n653\n00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:05,594\nWe are continuing on with Module 4, which\nis our footprinting and/or reconnaissance.\n\n654\n00:34:05,594 --> 00:34:10,335\nAnd we're getting ready to dive into\nour open source intelligence gathering,\n\n655\n00:34:10,335 --> 00:34:11,980\notherwise known as OSINT.\n\n656\n00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:18,375\nSo what have we got here, what the heck is\nOSINT, open source intelligence gathering?\n\n657\n00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:23,960\n>> Open source intelligence gathering for\nthe most part is just gathering\n\n658\n00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,987\nstuff from publicly available\nresources like search engines,\n\n659\n00:34:28,987 --> 00:34:33,080\npeople search resources, stuff like that.\n\n660\n00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,890\nThere's actually plenty\nof things you can gather\n\n661\n00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:39,620\ninformation from in the open source arena.\n\n662\n00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:44,860\nIt's just a question of just how much\ntime you want to spend on this and\n\n663\n00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,580\nwhat it is that you're\ntrying to accomplish.\n\n664\n00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,940\nI mean there's countless stuff in here.\n\n665\n00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,170\nYou can throw in social\nmedia stuff in here,\n\n666\n00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:53,570\nwhich I'm gonna cover in another segment.\n\n667\n00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:58,955\nBecause that's a big gold mine there\nthat needs to be discussed on its own.\n\n668\n00:34:58,955 --> 00:35:03,425\nYou can do stuff like search social media,\nyou can search through documents.\n\n669\n00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:08,875\nYou can use a whole ton, bring a whole\nbunch of tools to bear for this.\n\n670\n00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,260\nIt's a question of just\nhow far you wanna take it.\n\n671\n00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,880\nOf course-\n>> Which kind of takes us back to our\n\n672\n00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,180\nprevious where we talked about\nyour objectives and your goals for\n\n673\n00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,272\nyour footprinting phase.\n\n674\n00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:20,560\n>> Yeah, you've got to you definitely\nhave to set your goals and\n\n675\n00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,456\nexpectations very clearly.\n\n676\n00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:26,490\nYou've got a certain level of expectations\nwhich hopefully hey, you can meet all your\n\n677\n00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:30,290\nexpectations but you at least got to\nmeet the goals you set for yourself.\n\n678\n00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:35,300\nIf you don't set those goals and have\nit locked down on what you really need\n\n679\n00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,290\nto have, the essentials, then you're\ngonna be kind of just struggling around.\n\n680\n00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:42,470\n>> I'm just picturing somebody\nlike me in their basement.\n\n681\n00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,520\nTwo weeks later, beard is down to here and\nthey've been gathering information for\n\n682\n00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,268\nthree weeks.\n\n683\n00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:48,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Still don't\n\n684\n00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:52,250\nknow if I have what I need, but I'm\njust finding more and more information.\n\n685\n00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,210\n>> Kind of like when\nyou open Wikipedia and\n\n686\n00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,280\nyou find yourself searching something and\nyou're like click on that, click on that.\n\n687\n00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,360\nEight hours later you've\ngot nothing done but\n\n688\n00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,595\nyou know the history of poker so\nit's good.\n\n689\n00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:05,860\n[LAUGH]\n>> How the hell did I end up here and\n\n690\n00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,554\nwhy am I watching Nyan Cat?\n\n691\n00:36:07,554 --> 00:36:09,268\n>> Yeah, [LAUGH] exactly.\n\n692\n00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:14,540\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so,\nlet's see, what do you wanna do?\n\n693\n00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,565\nYou wanna go and show us some of this?\n\n694\n00:36:15,565 --> 00:36:17,588\n>> Yeah, let me-\n>> Wanna take a peek or\n\n695\n00:36:17,588 --> 00:36:18,891\nyou wanna talk about it\na little more first or?\n\n696\n00:36:18,891 --> 00:36:22,854\n>> You know what, I'll go and\ntake a look at this and\n\n697\n00:36:22,854 --> 00:36:27,130\nlet me bring up stuff here in my browser.\n\n698\n00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,830\nWe'll take a look at this and\nthen we will take a look at it and\n\n699\n00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,596\ntalk at the same time, so\nyou get an idea of what's happening.\n\n700\n00:36:33,596 --> 00:36:34,469\n>> Okay.\n>> As I said,\n\n701\n00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:39,973\nthere's a lot of places open source\nthat you can get information from.\n\n702\n00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:44,922\nSo what I have here is just\none website that consolidates\n\n703\n00:36:44,922 --> 00:36:47,340\na lot of it to make it easy.\n\n704\n00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,210\nThat's just one way of doing it.\n\n705\n00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,150\nYou can choose to do it this way or you\ncan go ahead and find your own tools, but\n\n706\n00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,680\nI found this to be very, very, handy.\n\n707\n00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,350\nJust in case you need the website.\n\n708\n00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,750\nIt's this Intel Techniques website.\n\n709\n00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,660\nIt's got this OSN IT section of it.\n\n710\n00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,830\nNow Michael Boz will actually,\nhe works with the government and\n\n711\n00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,850\ndoes some stuff on privacy,\nvery specific stuff.\n\n712\n00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,740\nWay different than just\nabout anybody needs.\n\n713\n00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:25,020\nBut what he has provided us is, he\nprovides us some very specific tools for\n\n714\n00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,090\nsearching various places.\n\n715\n00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:32,550\nIf you look in here we have things for\ndoing Facebook and for looking for emails.\n\n716\n00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,270\nI mean there's a lot here.\n\n717\n00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,150\nIf you look at it, for example,\nclick on all search engines.\n\n718\n00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,940\nThis is just really neat here.\n\n719\n00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,748\nIf you look at something like this,\nhe's got this custom search section.\n\n720\n00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:45,529\nIf you go into this custom search section,\n\n721\n00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:50,397\nyou can type in information here and\nsay okay, do a Submit All and I can say,\n\n722\n00:37:50,397 --> 00:37:53,896\nI'm going to look up Sean Oriyano,\nand hit Submit All.\n\n723\n00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:58,080\nI'm doing a vanity search on the Internet.\n\n724\n00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I could of looked up anything, but\n\n725\n00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,670\nI chose that.\n\n726\n00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,680\nIt's like let's make this about me.\n\n727\n00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,336\n>> Look at all the results,\na lot more than you'd get on me, I'm sure.\n\n728\n00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:09,016\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a lot of stuff that comes up.\n\n729\n00:38:09,016 --> 00:38:14,590\nNow something to remember, if you\ndidn't see it, when I clicked on it.\n\n730\n00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,350\nIf you look at this, well,\nlet me scroll over a bit here.\n\n731\n00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,525\nAnd you can see,\nit's still searching for stuff.\n\n732\n00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:22,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n733\n00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,570\n>> But, if you looked at\nthis page when it came up.\n\n734\n00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,710\nNotice at the bottom, if you're gonna\nuse this, one of the drawbacks,\n\n735\n00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:37,270\nif you wanna call it that,\nis this does work with Firefox.\n\n736\n00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This has been tuned to work with that.\n\n737\n00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,820\nSo when you bring up all those\ntabs it's done right in.\n\n738\n00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,320\nIt has to be done in Firefox or\nsomething that's using the Firefox engine.\n\n739\n00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,720\nSo a little bit of a drawback.\n\n740\n00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,780\nI know some people don't like Firefox.\n\n741\n00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,270\nEveryone has a browser preference, right?\n\n742\n00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,630\n>> Yeah it's like a Ford or Chevy thing.\n\n743\n00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n744\n00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,219\nWell we know Ford's better.\n\n745\n00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:59,675\n>> So [LAUGH].\n\n746\n00:38:59,675 --> 00:39:00,307\n>> Camaro all the way.\n\n747\n00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:04,695\nFord and Star Trek,\ndeal with it people, sorry.\n\n748\n00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:06,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n749\n00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:12,350\nthe thing here is that you have to\nuse Firefox for this, like I said,\n\n750\n00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,940\nsomething that's based\non the Firefox engine.\n\n751\n00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,570\nAnd if you do that, and\nI have tried it in Internet Explorer and\n\n752\n00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:24,990\na couple of other browsers, and\nit really only works reliably in Firefox.\n\n753\n00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,610\n>> These are all tools that we could\naccess individually outside of this.\n\n754\n00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,810\nThis is just a nice collection of\nthem all in one spot where you can\n\n755\n00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,640\nhit one button and submit, and\nyou can search all of them.\n\n756\n00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,648\n>> Exactly, that's what it is.\n\n757\n00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:36,849\nIt's one stop shopping.\n\n758\n00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:41,150\nIf you look at this and I go over here and\nstart looking at some of this,\n\n759\n00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,199\nthere's Bing.\n\n760\n00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:46,210\nSo it brings Bing up.\n\n761\n00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,540\nIt shows me what I've done.\n\n762\n00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:50,575\nWhich by the way,\nif anyone ever asks you what the most,\n\n763\n00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:54,528\nI don't know if you know this,\nthe most secure search engine out there?\n\n764\n00:39:54,528 --> 00:39:58,960\nIs actually Bing, because if you put in on\nBing, no one's ever gonna find it there.\n\n765\n00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,340\nNo one ever looks there.\n\n766\n00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,880\nSo-\n>> Too many jokes I can-\n\n767\n00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,300\n>> All right, [SOUND].\n\n768\n00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,000\n>> Yeah, right?\n\n769\n00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,960\n>> We gotta hook that up for tomorrow,\nI need some symbols and stuff like that.\n\n770\n00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,840\nSo, but\nit pulls up different search engines here.\n\n771\n00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:18,670\nI put my name in, so it brings up all\nthis stuff on here, here's Yahoo.\n\n772\n00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,560\nSo, you can go through and\njust see all these rolling.\n\n773\n00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,230\nSome of these search engines are ones\nthat you may not have seen before.\n\n774\n00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,300\nSo and I'll tell you,\nwhy would you wan gt too and\n\n775\n00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,100\nlook at search engines that,\nwhy go from Google.\n\n776\n00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,680\nGoogle seems to do everything, right?\n\n777\n00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,986\n>> That's right, absolutely.\nGoogle always has\n\n778\n00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:37,540\nthe answer I need, I think.\n\n779\n00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,380\n>> Yeah right.\n\n780\n00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,550\nGoogle seems to have all those things,\nand it helps you out.\n\n781\n00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,870\nIf you type something in,\nit's like, did you mean this?\n\n782\n00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,550\nThat's all well and good, and\n\n783\n00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:52,950\nI'm not saying by any\nmeans don't use Google.\n\n784\n00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,980\nWhat I always encourage anyone\nwho's going to get into this,\n\n785\n00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,800\nis say get used to a family of tools,\nokay?\n\n786\n00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,590\nIt's up to you which ones you want to use,\n\n787\n00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:10,670\nbut get used to having more than one\ntool that you can go to for something.\n\n788\n00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:13,250\nWhat's in one search engine isn't\ngoing to show up in another.\n\n789\n00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:16,750\n>> Exactly, you get pigeon-holed into\none browser, for example like that, or\n\n790\n00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,210\none search engine and it does.\n\n791\n00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:21,620\nGoogle gives great results but\ntheir spiders work in different ways.\n\n792\n00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,530\nThey index different pages,\nthey filter different things out.\n\n793\n00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,730\nSo by searching multiple engines\nlike that, try it yourself.\n\n794\n00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:31,060\nOpen up Google, do a search,\nand open up some other\n\n795\n00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,330\nsearch engine that you've never used and\ndo a search and compare your results.\n\n796\n00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,090\nAnd you'll see that each\none of them's going to have\n\n797\n00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,820\nlinks that the other one didn't get.\n\n798\n00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,630\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n799\n00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,820\nDon't limit yourself.\n\n800\n00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,860\nAll of the tools that you're going to\nsee in here, not just at this point, but\n\n801\n00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,750\nduring this whole CEH journey\nwe're taking, you're gonna see\n\n802\n00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:54,330\nthat I like to teach\na general category of tool.\n\n803\n00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:58,240\nLike when we get to sniffers,\nI'll talk here what a sniffer does.\n\n804\n00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,750\nSo I'll tell you generally\nwhat it does and\n\n805\n00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,150\nthen I'll focus on one specifically and\ntalk about some others.\n\n806\n00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,630\nThat's not to say that that's\nthe tool you should use.\n\n807\n00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,810\nI want you to know what that there's a\ngeneral rule with that category does, and\n\n808\n00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,410\nthen you find multiple\ntools that you can use.\n\n809\n00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,220\nThe keyword being multiple.\n\n810\n00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,850\nYou may not be able to use those tools.\n\n811\n00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,320\nYou may not have access,\nfor example, to Firefox.\n\n812\n00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,800\nYou may not be able to install\nthat to use something like this.\n\n813\n00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,840\nYou can make up a scenario where that\nhappens, it could very well happen.\n\n814\n00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,870\nYou're going to need to know\nhow to use different things.\n\n815\n00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:30,490\nMaybe Google's blocked.\n\n816\n00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:35,020\nMaybe, if you're someone that's overseas,\nI don't know if we have\n\n817\n00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,760\nanyone in this situation, not the overseas\npart, but Google has been guilty\n\n818\n00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,640\nof actually filtering results\nin certain countries too.\n\n819\n00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,980\nSo if you're relying on that as your go to\ntool then you may be limiting yourself.\n\n820\n00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:56,350\nI want you to see kind of every angle so\ndo remember that when you're doing this.\n\n821\n00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:01,520\nNone of this stuff I'm saying here is kind\nof like a it's like an endorsement and\n\n822\n00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,450\nthat's the one you need to use.\n\n823\n00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,540\n>> Just a quick, yeah,\nDogPile is still out there.\n\n824\n00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:09,620\nMy dad actually uses DogPile so\nI know that one's still out there.\n\n825\n00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,469\nIt's a search engine that searches\na few different search engines.\n\n826\n00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:15,613\n>> [LAUGH] I haven't heard\nthat one in a while.\n\n827\n00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:16,316\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n828\n00:43:16,316 --> 00:43:17,811\nBut it's still out there.\n\n829\n00:43:17,811 --> 00:43:20,185\n>> Anyone know if\nGeoCities is still around?\n\n830\n00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:26,132\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh,\n\n831\n00:43:26,132 --> 00:43:30,497\ngood, so yes, and just to reiterate what\nSean's saying, as we go through here,\n\n832\n00:43:30,497 --> 00:43:34,385\nwe're gonna see several different\ntools that do the same kind of thing.\n\n833\n00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:38,337\nAnd it's important to understand\nthe concept of what the tool's doing and\n\n834\n00:43:38,337 --> 00:43:39,410\nhow it's working.\n\n835\n00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,330\nAnd usually what I'll tell people is\nyou'll develop your favorite one,\n\n836\n00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,690\nyou'll pick Wireshark over\nNetwork Monitor or something like that.\n\n837\n00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,390\nBut you get the basic understanding and\nyou can jump back and\n\n838\n00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,580\nforth between the different ones and\nat least fumble your way around.\n\n839\n00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,530\nSo, it's the concept of\nwhat the tool's doing and\n\n840\n00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:57,290\nwhere I would use that tool and\nwhy, is what the exam wants.\n\n841\n00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,850\n>> Yeah it absolutely is.\n\n842\n00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:04,080\nIt's like you said, all kidding aside,\nit's the Ford or Chevy discussion.\n\n843\n00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,600\nIt's the Coke or Pepsi discussion.\n\n844\n00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,120\nI'm not going to tell you hey this\ntool's better than another one.\n\n845\n00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,740\nThere are a couple cases\nwhere I do tend to say,\n\n846\n00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,260\nokay this one in my opinion tends\nto work better than something else.\n\n847\n00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,280\nBut I would strongly encourage you to\nstart experimenting with different tools\n\n848\n00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,190\nand figure out the ones that work best for\nyou.\n\n849\n00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:27,415\nIdeally you should have, my opinion,\nyou should have three to five utilities or\n\n850\n00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:34,430\ngo-to options in every category and\nthen so you have some latitude there.\n\n851\n00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,330\nBut then, heck,\neven if those aren't available,\n\n852\n00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,790\nknow what a general category does.\n\n853\n00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,190\nWhen you look at open source intelligence\nlike we're talking about here, and\n\n854\n00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,130\nlooking at search engines, you know\nthe type of things that you need and\n\n855\n00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:46,580\nexpect to come back.\n\n856\n00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,710\nSo with that expectation,\nyou can go to anything.\n\n857\n00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:56,480\nSo but like I said if you\nsee the results I got for\n\n858\n00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,980\nthis open source website, I was showing\nyou the stuff I didn't hear on my name.\n\n859\n00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,270\nLet me go back and\nshow you some of the other ones.\n\n860\n00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:07,480\nYou know, not all these things on this\n\n861\n00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:12,590\nIntel techniques site not all these\nactually have a search behind it.\n\n862\n00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:14,570\nHe's still developing this.\n\n863\n00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:17,130\nAnd there's other areas,\nmake sure you get this stuff.\n\n864\n00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,440\nBut you can see he's got\na lot of things on here.\n\n865\n00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,900\nStuff to search people,\nstuff to search photos.\n\n866\n00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,010\nHe's got different categories for\n\n867\n00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:30,600\nsearching Google Plus stuff,\nsocial media, stuff.\n\n868\n00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,470\nI mean, there's a lot of\nthings it has in here for us.\n\n869\n00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,470\nSo, it's something that\nworth a bookmark and\n\n870\n00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,520\nseeing if it's something you could use.\n\n871\n00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,154\n>> Yeah, and for those of you who see the\n[COUGH] excuse me, I see the URL the chat\n\n872\n00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:47,410\nroom is creating, I'll make sure we put\nthis URL in the show notes as well.\n\n873\n00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:50,335\nSo you guys watching the recording can\nhave access to that very cool site,\n\n874\n00:45:50,335 --> 00:45:50,860\nI like that.\n\n875\n00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,170\nAll right, so we were talking\nabout intelligence techniques.\n\n876\n00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,440\nSo what kind of information are we\nreally trying to gather here?\n\n877\n00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:04,410\n>> Well, that depends on what\nyou've set your goals up front.\n\n878\n00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:11,190\nWhat I was talking about earlier was\nwhat types of information are out there.\n\n879\n00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,580\nSetting expectations and setting goals.\n\n880\n00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,780\nSo what can be gathered.\n\n881\n00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,500\nRealistically you need kind of to\nthink about what's easy to get and\n\n882\n00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,640\nwhat's not as easy to get.\n\n883\n00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,630\nCan you find stuff like\nSocial Security numbers online?\n\n884\n00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:27,780\nI'm not going to lie to you and\ntell you that you can't find that.\n\n885\n00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,846\nBut that's something that's going to\nbe much harder to get in most cases.\n\n886\n00:46:31,846 --> 00:46:36,330\nWhat you're going to be looking for, for\nopen source stuff, is you could be looking\n\n887\n00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:40,796\nfor anything from tax records, for\nproperty taxes, you can get those.\n\n888\n00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:46,460\nYou're looking for company directories,\nimages, there's a lot of things.\n\n889\n00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,209\nYou're looking at anything\nthat give that little\n\n890\n00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:54,950\ninsider information that may\nnot be immediately accessible.\n\n891\n00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,170\nJust plenty of information\nout there that we can grab.\n\n892\n00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,530\nAgain, how much time do you want to spend.\n\n893\n00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,350\nI could easily sit here\nthe rest of the day, tomorrow,\n\n894\n00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,710\nthe next day after that and\nwe could do a pretty good search.\n\n895\n00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,790\nOn any one of you.\n\n896\n00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,875\nIn fact, someone say it's okay and\n\n897\n00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:14,231\nI'll do a back-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n898\n00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:15,918\n>> [LAUGH] I'm just going to pick\n\n899\n00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:17,050\none off the list.\n\n900\n00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,140\nIn addition to our book giveaway,\n\n901\n00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,425\nI'm going to take away someone's privacy,\nright here on the air.\n\n902\n00:47:22,425 --> 00:47:24,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Makes me think of the guy that does\n\n903\n00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,150\nthe security lock or whatever,\nthe Life Lock thing.\n\n904\n00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,923\nWhere he's like putting his Social\nSecurity number on the side of the van.\n\n905\n00:47:29,923 --> 00:47:30,972\n>> Yeah, I ain't doing that.\n\n906\n00:47:30,972 --> 00:47:32,828\n[LAUGH]\n>> And you notice he doesn't do that\n\n907\n00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:33,932\nanymore, either.\n\n908\n00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:35,172\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\n\n909\n00:47:35,172 --> 00:47:37,120\nhe learned his lesson on that one.\n\n910\n00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,890\n>> Yes he did.\n>> You definitely do not want to do\n\n911\n00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,085\nsomething like that.\n\n912\n00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:42,430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't bait the hacker.\n\n913\n00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,590\n>> Exactly.\n\n914\n00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:50,740\n>> It's just, there's a lot of stuff\nout there, a lot of places you can go.\n\n915\n00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,250\nLike I said, set your goals on\nwhat you need to go forward.\n\n916\n00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:59,337\nI always like to say with open source,\nwhen you're going through here,\n\n917\n00:47:59,337 --> 00:48:03,843\nyou should at least be getting company\ninformation, at the very, very least.\n\n918\n00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:08,169\nYou don't necessarily have to be looking\nat technical stuff at this point.\n\n919\n00:48:08,169 --> 00:48:11,210\nBut you should at the very least\nbe getting company information,\n\n920\n00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,655\npersonnel information,\nfinding out what they do.\n\n921\n00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:17,530\nDon't forget those little things that\nyou may not necessarily think of,\n\n922\n00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:18,414\nlike job sites.\n\n923\n00:48:18,414 --> 00:48:23,674\nJob sites can be a very good\nopen source resource for you.\n\n924\n00:48:23,674 --> 00:48:25,909\n>> I think that's one that\nthe people don't think about.\n\n925\n00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:29,610\nWhat kind of information can I get if I go\nto Monster and I see the ad, this company\n\n926\n00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,169\nis hiring somebody, what kind of\ninformation am I hoping to gain from that?\n\n927\n00:48:33,169 --> 00:48:39,507\n>> Yeah, I can actually show\nyou right here on my computer.\n\n928\n00:48:39,507 --> 00:48:43,951\nI brought up dice.com here to\nshow you to show you this,\n\n929\n00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:48,217\nlike if I just want to,\nI'll just make this generic.\n\n930\n00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:52,262\nI won't even worry about our location\nhere, I'll just say look anywhere.\n\n931\n00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:52,872\n>> Okay.\n\n932\n00:48:52,872 --> 00:48:54,544\n>> Let's just say for a CEH.\n\n933\n00:48:54,544 --> 00:48:59,808\nSo, for someone looking for\na job that requires CEH skills.\n\n934\n00:48:59,808 --> 00:49:02,126\nNothing that's really kind of crazy.\n\n935\n00:49:02,126 --> 00:49:05,480\nSo if I, let's say find jobs out there,\nit does our search.\n\n936\n00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,267\nOkay, we get some jobs back.\n\n937\n00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:12,002\nNow, I've made this pretty broad here,\nbut for your pen testing,\n\n938\n00:49:12,002 --> 00:49:14,181\nyou would use this like a search engine.\n\n939\n00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:17,016\nAnd get something like,\ntarget a company and\n\n940\n00:49:17,016 --> 00:49:20,005\nthen see what type of\njobs they have available.\n\n941\n00:49:20,005 --> 00:49:23,406\nAnd so if I look at some of these things,\nlike information security analyst.\n\n942\n00:49:23,406 --> 00:49:28,128\nLet's see if this reveals anything, and\nI'm doing this right here in front of your\n\n943\n00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:31,508\neyes, so you know I'm not\npulling any weird stuff in here.\n\n944\n00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:35,803\nBut this actually does give\nus some good information.\n\n945\n00:49:35,803 --> 00:49:40,203\nIf you look at it responsibilities, you\ncan see you get a good idea of what that\n\n946\n00:49:40,203 --> 00:49:42,856\njob's supposed to do I mean,\nokay, so fine.\n\n947\n00:49:42,856 --> 00:49:45,787\nWhen we go through the list and\nsee required skills,\n\n948\n00:49:45,787 --> 00:49:47,326\nlook what we actually see.\n\n949\n00:49:47,326 --> 00:49:48,948\n>> That's where it gets interesting,\ndoesn't it?\n\n950\n00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:52,656\n>> Yeah, this isn't the pot\nof gold necessarily, but\n\n951\n00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,191\nwere at least getting some change.\n\n952\n00:49:55,191 --> 00:49:56,683\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n953\n00:49:56,683 --> 00:49:58,958\n>> What we are seeing here is,\ntake a look.\n\n954\n00:49:58,958 --> 00:50:03,230\nWhen you look at that third bullet point\non this, intrusion detection systems,\n\n955\n00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,431\nSourcefire, Palo Alto, Trend Micro.\n\n956\n00:50:05,431 --> 00:50:08,427\nThere's only one reason why\nthey're asking us this.\n\n957\n00:50:08,427 --> 00:50:10,840\n>> And this is because they're\nrunning it on that network, right?\n\n958\n00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,580\n>> Yeah,\nthey would like you to have those.\n\n959\n00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,648\nThose are there.\n\n960\n00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:17,373\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So those are good things and if we keep\n\n961\n00:50:17,373 --> 00:50:22,498\ngoing down the list here, we see stuff\nlike vulnerability scanning, oh, Nessus.\n\n962\n00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:23,548\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n963\n00:50:23,548 --> 00:50:26,450\n>> They've specifically narrowed\nit down to one in there.\n\n964\n00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,171\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> And\n\n965\n00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:32,086\nyou can keep going through this\nto see things like UNIX in there,\n\n966\n00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:37,310\nPC UNIX, so they've got that there,\nWindows Exchange, SQL.\n\n967\n00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:39,280\nWe got databases out there.\n\n968\n00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,238\n>> Yeah.\n>> We don't necessarily know if that means\n\n969\n00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:42,871\nSQL Server, but I know it's SQL.\n\n970\n00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:46,267\nSo we've got some good information here.\n\n971\n00:50:46,267 --> 00:50:49,895\nThis is far from being the most\ndetailed one I've seen.\n\n972\n00:50:49,895 --> 00:50:53,743\nI've seen actually more detailed\nones in my poking around.\n\n973\n00:50:53,743 --> 00:50:56,686\n>> It'll say,\nexperience needed with SQL Server 2008.\n\n974\n00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,161\nSomething like that.\n\n975\n00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,476\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n976\n00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:02,732\nthis isn't necessarily\nthe most detailed one, but\n\n977\n00:51:02,732 --> 00:51:06,661\nthere are some little nuggets in\nhere that I could use later on.\n\n978\n00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:10,097\nAnd as you can see, this fits\nthe criteria of being open source.\n\n979\n00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:14,300\nI didn't do any hacking here,\nthis is just me looking around.\n\n980\n00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,493\n>> This is information they have\nintentionally made available to you.\n\n981\n00:51:16,493 --> 00:51:19,974\n>> Yeah, and thing is, that if you're\na company and you need to do this, and\n\n982\n00:51:19,974 --> 00:51:21,672\ncompanies need to do this, right?\n\n983\n00:51:21,672 --> 00:51:23,407\nYou can't say don't advertise for people.\n\n984\n00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:25,693\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If they know the secret handshake then\n\n985\n00:51:25,693 --> 00:51:26,506\nI'll tell them.\n\n986\n00:51:26,506 --> 00:51:28,256\nNo, you can't do that.\n\n987\n00:51:28,256 --> 00:51:32,369\nWhat you can do as a company,\nis that when you put a job posting out,\n\n988\n00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:36,117\nthat job posting you could put\nit out with information that,\n\n989\n00:51:36,117 --> 00:51:39,888\nthis can be pulled out to a certain\ndegree or be more generic.\n\n990\n00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,795\nOr if you need to specify that,\n\n991\n00:51:41,795 --> 00:51:45,378\nyour company can hire\nan outside employment agency.\n\n992\n00:51:45,378 --> 00:51:50,730\nAnd that way when it comes up in\nsomething like Dice, you can see here,\n\n993\n00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:56,007\nit's got this AMS,\nI believe this is a staffing company.\n\n994\n00:51:56,007 --> 00:51:57,585\nI think it's what it says right on there.\n\n995\n00:51:57,585 --> 00:51:59,212\nThat's what this company,\n\n996\n00:51:59,212 --> 00:52:03,421\nthat's what the client has done is\nthey've contracted with these guys.\n\n997\n00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:07,107\nSo presumably what they do is they\nhave people apply for this job.\n\n998\n00:52:07,107 --> 00:52:12,083\nAnd then they apply for the job,\nthey screen them and see if they're\n\n999\n00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:17,167\nall on the level, and then those\nones get forwarded on to the client.\n\n1000\n00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,814\nAnd the client decides who\nthey're gonna pick off that list.\n\n1001\n00:52:19,814 --> 00:52:23,054\nSo there's a lot of things\nyou can actually do,\n\n1002\n00:52:23,054 --> 00:52:27,923\nbut you need to really think about it,\nbecause I found some stuff here.\n\n1003\n00:52:27,923 --> 00:52:29,963\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1004\n00:52:29,963 --> 00:52:32,407\nSo we've got our open source where we,\n\n1005\n00:52:32,407 --> 00:52:35,453\njust a plethora of available\noptions out there.\n\n1006\n00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,189\nSo many different places we can look.\n\n1007\n00:52:37,189 --> 00:52:40,478\nYou mentioned some of the social media\nwhich I think we'll talk about a little\n\n1008\n00:52:40,478 --> 00:52:42,150\nlater in more detail.\n\n1009\n00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:45,430\n>> What about not open source?\n\n1010\n00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,966\nI guess you start getting into\nthe competitive intelligence?\n\n1011\n00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:52,459\n>> Yes, that's another very good\npoint to mention in here is that,\n\n1012\n00:52:52,459 --> 00:52:54,828\nwhat about if you have a company and\n\n1013\n00:52:54,828 --> 00:53:00,156\nyou need to find out about that company\na bit more than be publicly available.\n\n1014\n00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:04,769\nWell, one really good site for it here,\nand I'll just bring it up for you,\n\n1015\n00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:05,367\nis CNBC.\n\n1016\n00:53:05,367 --> 00:53:12,300\nThis is the one that people see,\nstock market stuff and things like that.\n\n1017\n00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,380\nWell, what you can do in this is\nif it's a publicly traded company,\n\n1018\n00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:21,339\nsomeone like Microsoft, you go through and\nyou type in their symbol okay, fine.\n\n1019\n00:53:21,339 --> 00:53:24,509\nIt comes back and\nit gives me what their stock price is.\n\n1020\n00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:26,245\nOh, 43, give me a second I gotta sell.\n\n1021\n00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:27,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, no.\n\n1022\n00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,270\n[LAUGH] Roll the window!\n\n1023\n00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:35,140\nBut what I can be looking for\nhere is that when you start seeing stuff,\n\n1024\n00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,498\nyou can start looking at stuff\nlike ownership of a company.\n\n1025\n00:53:38,498 --> 00:53:41,672\nAnd that will give you people\nthat have put money in it,\n\n1026\n00:53:41,672 --> 00:53:44,156\nwho major share holders are in some cases,\n\n1027\n00:53:44,156 --> 00:53:47,898\nyou can even look at the financials\nthis just maybe a good thing.\n\n1028\n00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:51,181\nWhen you look at the financials of\nthe company and earning statements,\n\n1029\n00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:53,433\nsometimes they will have\nstuff hidden in there.\n\n1030\n00:53:53,433 --> 00:53:58,027\nCuz remember,\nyou may even see stuff in here like\n\n1031\n00:53:58,027 --> 00:54:02,860\nconference calls, and\nyou may see links to those.\n\n1032\n00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,304\nThe companies sometimes do\nquarterly conference calls.\n\n1033\n00:54:05,304 --> 00:54:08,131\nThey're not required to, but\nthey can do quarterly conference calls.\n\n1034\n00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:12,066\nIt may be worth your time to kinda go\nthrough that or read a transcript,\n\n1035\n00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:15,147\ncuz remember the CEO, CFO,\nthose guys do this thing.\n\n1036\n00:54:15,147 --> 00:54:19,558\nTheir job is to pump up the company and\nmake people wanna invest in it,\n\n1037\n00:54:19,558 --> 00:54:20,479\nget excited.\n\n1038\n00:54:20,479 --> 00:54:24,696\nBut so what happens is they will talk\nabout projects that they're on and\n\n1039\n00:54:24,696 --> 00:54:27,859\nprojects that they're working on,\ngot coming up and\n\n1040\n00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:30,479\nwhere they're trying to go strategy wise.\n\n1041\n00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,883\nYou might be able to learn\nsomething out of that.\n\n1042\n00:54:32,883 --> 00:54:34,978\nYou might be able to learn\nat the very least jargon.\n\n1043\n00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:38,740\nBut you may learn project names\nare specifics on that and\n\n1044\n00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:42,195\nthat may give you clues on\nhow to proceed on things.\n\n1045\n00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,819\nCuz I said, CEOs gotta sell stuff but\nalso remember, CEOs,\n\n1046\n00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:48,489\nwhile they have to sell stuff they\nalso have to walk that line of\n\n1047\n00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:51,424\nwhat can they talk about,\nwhat should they not talk about?\n\n1048\n00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:54,572\nThey're not versed like you or I would be,\n\n1049\n00:54:54,572 --> 00:54:58,775\nthey're versed to be sales people and\nbusiness people.\n\n1050\n00:54:58,775 --> 00:55:00,533\nThey're not a security person,\n\n1051\n00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:04,947\nthough they may very well not think about\nsomething when they see it going I forgot.\n\n1052\n00:55:04,947 --> 00:55:06,161\nCould have had a V8 right?\n\n1053\n00:55:06,161 --> 00:55:09,761\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So they will make those mistakes and\n\n1054\n00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:13,378\nwe could be on our game and\npick those things up.\n\n1055\n00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:15,247\n>> Right, right I guess.\n\n1056\n00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:17,917\nSo a lot of different open\nsource information available.\n\n1057\n00:55:17,917 --> 00:55:20,873\nWe've got you know just using our\nsearch engines and using some of the,\n\n1058\n00:55:20,873 --> 00:55:21,865\nwhat was the other one?\n\n1059\n00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:25,887\nThe Intela, I forgot the URL for\nthat already.\n\n1060\n00:55:25,887 --> 00:55:26,444\n>> Intel techniques?\n\n1061\n00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:27,240\n>> Intel techniques, yeah.\n\n1062\n00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,999\nWe could do something like that, and\n\n1063\n00:55:28,999 --> 00:55:32,417\nthen we can move on in to letting other\npeople do the work for us, right?\n\n1064\n00:55:32,417 --> 00:55:35,754\nUsing this competitive intelligence,\nand using those kinds of tools to find\n\n1065\n00:55:35,754 --> 00:55:39,804\na surprising amount of information that\nwe could then use in our next phases.\n\n1066\n00:55:39,804 --> 00:55:44,228\n>> Yeah, or I should add in when we\ntalk about competitive intelligence.\n\n1067\n00:55:44,228 --> 00:55:48,234\nCompetitive intelligence, one of the\nthings to really remember with that is,\n\n1068\n00:55:48,234 --> 00:55:51,598\nand I think you bring up a good point,\nlet other people work for us.\n\n1069\n00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:57,452\nThere's a lot of money on the line when\nyou're talking about publicly traded\n\n1070\n00:55:57,452 --> 00:55:58,258\ncompanies.\n\n1071\n00:55:58,258 --> 00:56:02,290\nI have to know as, one company, I have\nto stay in tune with what my competitors\n\n1072\n00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,950\nare doing cuz I don't want them to\nget the jump on me and get out ahead.\n\n1073\n00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:11,750\nSo what I will do is I will look,\ndo research on as a competitor.\n\n1074\n00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:16,306\nIf I can get a hold of that research that\na competitor does when I'm doing a pen\n\n1075\n00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:21,079\ntest against company A, if company B's\nresearching them already I can somehow\n\n1076\n00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:24,630\nlook at company B and\ninfer what company A is doing.\n\n1077\n00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,550\nAnd especially if you're dealing with a\ncompany that happens to be a market leader\n\n1078\n00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:32,570\nin their segment, they're definitely\nbeing investigated, by other companies.\n\n1079\n00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,753\nI worked for a company that was\nlike that way years ago and\n\n1080\n00:56:36,753 --> 00:56:40,940\nthey were getting looked at\nby a lot of other companies.\n\n1081\n00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,512\nI remember one case where somehow they\nheard of a product we were working on, and\n\n1082\n00:56:44,512 --> 00:56:48,187\nall of a sudden, out of the blue, people\non the outside were saying hey, they have\n\n1083\n00:56:48,187 --> 00:56:51,683\na product just like that, when they had\nno indication of going that way before.\n\n1084\n00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:55,564\nAll of a sudden they've got plans to\ndo this thing and gonna release it,\n\n1085\n00:56:55,564 --> 00:56:58,490\nwe knew they somehow got a hold of it,\nthey got a leak.\n\n1086\n00:56:58,490 --> 00:57:01,551\nAnd that's type of things that you\ncan kind of learn from competitive\n\n1087\n00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:05,900\nintelligence, why'd they do that, that was\nnot part of their strategy, or whatever.\n\n1088\n00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,900\nThat's because they wanna get\nthe jump on these other guys.\n\n1089\n00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,430\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1090\n00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:13,860\nAll right, so when we look at all\nthis OS INT and everything, so\n\n1091\n00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:18,660\nin the end, what we're really trying to\ndo is get information that we can use,\n\n1092\n00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,060\nthen, in the next phase.\n\n1093\n00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,808\nSo what should we have when\nwe're finished with this.\n\n1094\n00:57:23,808 --> 00:57:28,020\n>> Well the scanning phase is\nthe phase that comes after this and\n\n1095\n00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,960\nthe scanning phase is much more technical.\n\n1096\n00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,910\nSo, one of the things that\nyou're gonna wanna have\n\n1097\n00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,730\nis you're gonna wanna have some\ngood technical information.\n\n1098\n00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:41,900\nAt the very least you should have some,\na range of\n\n1099\n00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:46,960\nIP addresses, get that DNS info,\nget things like that.\n\n1100\n00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,800\nBecause our scanning is where we're\nstarting to do port scans and\n\n1101\n00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,980\nsweep ranges of IP to see which\nones are actually active.\n\n1102\n00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:57,560\nSo we need to get as much of that as\nwe can and be as complete as possible.\n\n1103\n00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,930\nFortunately, much like the open\nsource intelligence gathering,\n\n1104\n00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:04,540\na lot of that is actually\nvery easily accessible.\n\n1105\n00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,460\nSo we just have to know where to look, and\nso that's what we have coming up ahead.\n\n1106\n00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:11,240\nAnd we're going to make sure\nthat we get as much of that to\n\n1107\n00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,790\ngo in to the scanning phase.\n\n1108\n00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:14,140\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1109\n00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:18,080\nAll right, well that's probably a good\nplace for us to take a little break.\n\n1110\n00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,120\nAnd when we come back we're going to\ncontinue on with our footprinting and\n\n1111\n00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,200\nreconnaissance.\n\n1112\n00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,400\nWe get into some things like using our\nsearch engines and some Google hacking.\n\n1113\n00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,565\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1114\n00:58:28,565 --> 00:58:34,197\n[SOUND]\n>> All\n\n1115\n00:58:34,197 --> 00:58:36,314\nright welcome back ladies and gentleman.\n\n1116\n00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:43,039\nWe are continuing on with our open\nsource intelligence gathering.\n\n1117\n00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,022\nAnd we're doing our footprinting and\nreconnaissance, and\n\n1118\n00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,250\nI think right now we're gonna\nhead into Google hacking, right?\n\n1119\n00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,030\nProbably heard a little bit about,\nI'm sure you guys have heard that term.\n\n1120\n00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:54,700\nAnd we're not talking about\nhacking Google, right Sean?\n\n1121\n00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,615\n>> No we're not talking\nabout hacking Google.\n\n1122\n00:58:56,615 --> 00:58:59,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know as much as some of you would\n\n1123\n00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,380\nlike to do that.\n\n1124\n00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:03,465\nThat's kind of the other episodes that we\n\n1125\n00:59:03,465 --> 00:59:05,277\nhaven't-\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, we'll save that for\n\n1126\n00:59:05,277 --> 00:59:07,307\nlater.\n>> Those are super premium ultra stuff\n\n1127\n00:59:07,307 --> 00:59:11,250\nthat you've got to know the secret\nhandshake and all that to get into it.\n\n1128\n00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,188\nThat's in my book Hacking For\nFun and Profit.\n\n1129\n00:59:13,188 --> 00:59:14,962\n[LAUGH] Kidding.\n\n1130\n00:59:14,962 --> 00:59:17,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anyway, but\n\n1131\n00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:19,522\nno we're not hacking Google.\n\n1132\n00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:23,760\n>> No, no so\nwhat do they mean by Google hacking then?\n\n1133\n00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,550\n>> You know, it's a great question.\n\n1134\n00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,530\nWhen you first hear the term,\n\n1135\n00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:30,910\nGoogle hacking, yeah you do tend to\nthink that it's hacking into Google.\n\n1136\n00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,516\nAnd that's just not the case.\n\n1137\n00:59:32,516 --> 00:59:37,341\nYou've got to think of the,\none of the other\n\n1138\n00:59:37,341 --> 00:59:42,047\ncommonly used places that we use hacking.\n\n1139\n00:59:42,047 --> 00:59:46,185\nWhen we talk about hacking, people talk\nabout having a life hack or a hack for\n\n1140\n00:59:46,185 --> 00:59:50,076\nthis, talking about some way to kind\nof make your life easier, right?\n\n1141\n00:59:50,076 --> 00:59:54,910\nSo what we're doing here,\nis we're kind of doing the same thing.\n\n1142\n00:59:54,910 --> 01:00:00,200\nWe're talking about hacking, using Google,\nbut hacking our search attempts,\n\n1143\n01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,900\nour search queries to streamline a bit\nmore and get the results that we want.\n\n1144\n01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:09,360\nAnyone that's been through any search\nengine since the things were invented\n\n1145\n01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:13,280\nknow that you just don't get\nthe results that you want.\n\n1146\n01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,870\nUsually you don't get a bunch\nof results that you want,\n\n1147\n01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:19,150\nyou usually get your results like\non the first two maybe three pages.\n\n1148\n01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,580\nIf it's not on the first page,\nthey've definitely gotten better.\n\n1149\n01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:28,380\nBut if you usually type stuff in and you\nget a bunch of stuff that's kinda sort of\n\n1150\n01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,810\nand maybe a couple things\nthat are kinda related.\n\n1151\n01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:36,385\nAnd that's all well and\ngood for the general public.\n\n1152\n01:00:36,385 --> 01:00:40,385\nBut for what we do,\nwe wanna gave much more targeted results.\n\n1153\n01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:45,305\nWe can use Google to get us those results,\nbut then we can also use\n\n1154\n01:00:45,305 --> 01:00:50,285\nthings to really kind of drill down and\ntarget specific items.\n\n1155\n01:00:50,285 --> 01:00:51,775\nAnd so, that's what Google hacking does.\n\n1156\n01:00:51,775 --> 01:00:55,005\nIt's actually saying don't just look for\nthese terms, look for\n\n1157\n01:00:55,005 --> 01:00:57,580\nthem in a specific way.\n\n1158\n01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,120\n>> Right,\nbecause a lot of people don't realize,\n\n1159\n01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,820\nthat when you're first getting into this,\nthat you can do more,\n\n1160\n01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,465\nthan just type the words,\nthat you're searching for, right.\n\n1161\n01:01:04,465 --> 01:01:06,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That there's ways that we can use\n\n1162\n01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:08,760\nfilters that are built into Google.\n\n1163\n01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:11,670\nThat they don't really,\nit's not like I've ever seen a page,\n\n1164\n01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:14,010\nwell now not Google has to come out and\npresent this information.\n\n1165\n01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,810\nBut if you know where to look and\nfind this information you can do some\n\n1166\n01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:19,250\nsurprising things with these\nsearch engines, and like you said,\n\n1167\n01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,490\nreally refine your search to include\njust what you're looking for.\n\n1168\n01:01:23,490 --> 01:01:26,730\nWith some pretty impressive stuff,\npretty impressive results.\n\n1169\n01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:30,550\n>> Yes, it's actually kinda funny that\nyou bring that up is that Google for\n\n1170\n01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,640\na long time didn't publicize this stuff.\n\n1171\n01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,500\nAnd it wasn't because it was secret, it's\njust because I don't think they really\n\n1172\n01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,800\nthought anyone would want it or\nwould want to get into it like that.\n\n1173\n01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,140\nMost people are fine to put the quotes\naround things and say okay,\n\n1174\n01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,510\nwell that's good.\n\n1175\n01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,000\nBut now, it's a much more\ncommonly known technique at least\n\n1176\n01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,780\namong people that are more tech savvy.\n\n1177\n01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,240\nThey're much more likely to\nknow these things, and in\n\n1178\n01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:01,470\nfact there was a book that was published\na long time ago and it's still around.\n\n1179\n01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:07,050\nThere's a book, you know, what was it,\nGoogle Hacking by, I forget who makes it.\n\n1180\n01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,930\n>> Johnny.ihackstuff or-\n>> It was somebody else,\n\n1181\n01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,600\nit's somebody else that did it.\n\n1182\n01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,270\nBut they put out this Google Hacking book,\n\n1183\n01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:20,020\nand it was so popular that Google's\nown engineers bought it and\n\n1184\n01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:22,460\nhad it on their desks as their own\nreference guide for their product.\n\n1185\n01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:25,030\nIt was like, you don't have\nyour own instruction manual?\n\n1186\n01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:26,420\nNo, someone else wrote it for us.\n\n1187\n01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,640\nWe had to buy it.\n\n1188\n01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:30,450\nWe had to pay for the instruction manual\nfor the stuff that we created, right?\n\n1189\n01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:30,990\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1190\n01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:32,796\n>> Yeah, so it was that good, and\n\n1191\n01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:36,000\nit was very, very,\nvery popular, still is popular.\n\n1192\n01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,760\nYou can still find it.\n\n1193\n01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,540\nIf you're really gonna get into\nthe guts of doing Google hacking and\n\n1194\n01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,804\nbecome like a ninja at this stuff, then\nyou've really kind of got to get a book or\n\n1195\n01:02:43,804 --> 01:02:45,339\nresource that and really practice.\n\n1196\n01:02:45,339 --> 01:02:46,009\n>> Yep.\n\n1197\n01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:51,473\n>> But once you do, it's an insanely\npowerful tool to have in your arsenal.\n\n1198\n01:02:51,473 --> 01:02:52,200\n>> Right.\n\n1199\n01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,928\nIt really is, and Sean,\none of the guys in our chat room,\n\n1200\n01:02:54,928 --> 01:02:59,230\nSean mentioning some of the,\nI guess they're called operators,\n\n1201\n01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:04,880\nthat you can use in refining your search\ndefinitely have been exploited for\n\n1202\n01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,930\nadvertisement purposes and\nthings like that as well.\n\n1203\n01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:11,360\nSo some of it you're not getting as\naccurate results as we used to get.\n\n1204\n01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,235\nFor sure, for sure.\n\n1205\n01:03:14,235 --> 01:03:15,280\n>> Yeah,\n\n1206\n01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,540\nevery time a new thing is introduced\nsomeone finds a way to exploit it.\n\n1207\n01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:21,990\n>> Yeah, and make money with it.\n\n1208\n01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:27,150\n>> Yeah, so, as long as you're aware of\nthat you can definitely fine tune your\n\n1209\n01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,630\nresults to get what you want.\n\n1210\n01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:31,300\nYou've just got to be\naware of that situation.\n\n1211\n01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:35,980\n>> Right.\n>> So anyway, there you go.\n\n1212\n01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:37,670\n>> So Google hacking,\nwe're not hacking Google,\n\n1213\n01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:41,370\nwe're using Google as a tool to\nfacilitate our footprinting.\n\n1214\n01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:43,900\nA way to refine those\nsearches to really get\n\n1215\n01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,458\nthe information that we are looking for.\n\n1216\n01:03:45,458 --> 01:03:48,420\nSo, very good.\n\n1217\n01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,960\nHow can we get started?\n\n1218\n01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,640\nWhat can we do with this Google hacking?\n\n1219\n01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,120\nWhat kind of thing should I try to do?\n\n1220\n01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:59,090\n>> Well, the question comes down to\nreally what it is you are looking for.\n\n1221\n01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:04,880\nYou can do stuff like intitle which\nI saw mentioned in our group here.\n\n1222\n01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,460\nThere's also a tool or\na search called inurl.\n\n1223\n01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:14,794\nAnd then there's a whole host of other\nones like LINK and LIKE and CACHE and\n\n1224\n01:04:14,794 --> 01:04:19,490\na whole bunch of ones you can use\nthat will pull out different results.\n\n1225\n01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:24,300\nOne of the ones that's a favorite, for\nexample, just to kinda give you guys some\n\n1226\n01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:30,960\ninsight on it, is I will use one here in\nGoogle which I have up on my screen here.\n\n1227\n01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:36,495\nAll you have to do is type inurl,\nand I put in that quote.\n\n1228\n01:04:36,495 --> 01:04:39,105\nOr, inurl and then put a colon, and\n\n1229\n01:04:39,105 --> 01:04:44,927\nwhat I'll do is I'll say something like a\nfavorite one that they use is this TSWeb.\n\n1230\n01:04:44,927 --> 01:04:47,990\nAnd this is kinda for\nsome of you that have TSWeb,\n\n1231\n01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:52,707\nis the Terminal Services website\non the Microsoft platform.\n\n1232\n01:04:52,707 --> 01:04:59,636\nIt is the default location where their\nadministration/remote access goes.\n\n1233\n01:04:59,636 --> 01:05:04,086\nSo if someone hasn't changed that,\nyou're gonna find it in this location,\n\n1234\n01:05:04,086 --> 01:05:05,253\nwhich I can type in.\n\n1235\n01:05:05,253 --> 01:05:11,210\nI can say, look for anything that's TSWeb,\ndefault.htm in there.\n\n1236\n01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:14,800\nNow if you looked down these\nresults in here, it says,\n\n1237\n01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,840\nokay, I've looked for the inurl operator.\n\n1238\n01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,310\nAnd if I go down this list I see,\n\n1239\n01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:24,980\nokay, well, there's a lot of\nstuff showing up in this list.\n\n1240\n01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:27,260\nIf you look at the first one,\n\n1241\n01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:31,460\nit's got this Honda website and\nthis tswebdefault.htm.\n\n1242\n01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:33,060\nWell, it's got it highlighted.\n\n1243\n01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:35,547\nIt's telling us, hey,\nI found this right here.\n\n1244\n01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:38,286\nSome of these other ones\nare actually not in the URL,\n\n1245\n01:05:38,286 --> 01:05:41,560\nit's found the URL in the document itself.\n\n1246\n01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:46,070\nSo you could click on these and\nsee something.\n\n1247\n01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:48,420\nIn fact, if I were to,\nlet's see if I click on this first one,\n\n1248\n01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,260\nthis Service Honda site,\nwell, it brought up a page.\n\n1249\n01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:55,440\nThat is definitely a web page that has\n\n1250\n01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,220\nthe Terminal Services ActiveX\ncontrol embedded inside if it.\n\n1251\n01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:03,000\nAnd look what we have here actually,\n\n1252\n01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,740\nit's kind of interesting\nif you look on this page.\n\n1253\n01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,620\n>> Wow.\n>> I looked at the URL.\n\n1254\n01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But also look what's there.\n\n1255\n01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:13,019\nNot only do I know this is a portal\nto a Terminal Services somehow,\n\n1256\n01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:16,150\nI've got an IP address there too.\n\n1257\n01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:23,130\nSo, it just means that, heck,\nI've got another IP address to target.\n\n1258\n01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:27,530\nSo I could just go through and get Excel\nor whatever else I want out, Notepad,\n\n1259\n01:06:27,530 --> 01:06:30,870\nwrite it down, and\nthat's something to add to the list.\n\n1260\n01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:32,050\nAnd put a little asterisk next to it,\n\n1261\n01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:37,410\nsay this looks like it's a Terminal\nServices or what they call Remote Desktop.\n\n1262\n01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,540\nNow I can go after and target that.\n\n1263\n01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:40,160\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n1264\n01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,390\nStart doing some brute forcing on\nthat password dialogue there and\n\n1265\n01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:43,990\nthings like that.\n\n1266\n01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:47,119\n>> You could.\n>> I mean, it's amazing to me.\n\n1267\n01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,836\nI think one of the things that some people\ndon't realize is that the way these search\n\n1268\n01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:53,775\nengines spiders work and\nthe way they gather their information.\n\n1269\n01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:57,232\nPeople think that if they have a website\nbut they take a particular page and\n\n1270\n01:06:57,232 --> 01:07:00,854\nthey don't put a direct link to it, so\nthere's no hyperlink to this page, so\n\n1271\n01:07:00,854 --> 01:07:03,230\nnobody's ever gonna be able to find it.\n\n1272\n01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:05,510\nAnd that's just not true,\nbecause these search engines find it.\n\n1273\n01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:06,962\nThe search engines are gonna spider it.\n\n1274\n01:07:06,962 --> 01:07:10,295\nThey're gonna gather that information, and\nthen using the right search techniques,\n\n1275\n01:07:10,295 --> 01:07:14,410\nI've found pages full of passwords,\naccounts, and\n\n1276\n01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:18,280\nit's just amazing to me what people will\nput out there, not knowing any better.\n\n1277\n01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,653\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1278\n01:07:20,653 --> 01:07:27,600\nThere's this old concept they talk about,\nsecurity through obscurity.\n\n1279\n01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,650\nThe idea of you just make it so someone\ncan't easily find it, and therefore,\n\n1280\n01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,030\nit must be secure.\n\n1281\n01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:35,850\nI kind of liken it,\nif that doesn't quite make sense,\n\n1282\n01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:39,380\nI kind of liken it to when\nyou go to the fridge and\n\n1283\n01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:43,360\nthere's some stuff in the back of\nthe fridge and some stuff at the front.\n\n1284\n01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,570\nAnd then, later on, you go start\ntaking stuff out of the fridge and\n\n1285\n01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:47,040\nthen something grabs your hand and\n\n1286\n01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:50,020\nit's the eggs you forgot were in\nthere you put in three months ago.\n\n1287\n01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:52,698\nBecause you can't see it,\ntherefore it must not be there\n\n1288\n01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:53,379\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1289\n01:07:53,379 --> 01:07:57,820\n>> So that used to be experigus and\nit's choking you.\n\n1290\n01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,590\nIt's kind of the same concept.\n\n1291\n01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:01,700\nYou can't see it,\ntherefore it must not be there.\n\n1292\n01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,570\nI use the same concept at\nhome when I'm cleaning.\n\n1293\n01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:07,320\nIf you can't see it, it's not dirty.\n\n1294\n01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,755\n[LAUGH] I'm kidding, I'm kidding.\n\n1295\n01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:11,823\n>> It's great when I\nleave my contacts out.\n\n1296\n01:08:11,823 --> 01:08:13,355\nHelps me clean a lot.\n\n1297\n01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:17,047\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Hey, glad I could help.\n\n1298\n01:08:17,047 --> 01:08:23,875\nSo that's something\ndefinitely to think about.\n\n1299\n01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:26,775\nJust, on the Internet,\nyou can't use the same type of thing.\n\n1300\n01:08:26,775 --> 01:08:30,870\nOn the Internet, if something, you think\nit's hidden, doesn't mean it is hidden.\n\n1301\n01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:35,030\nStuff does get spidered and\n\n1302\n01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:39,700\nfound by the agents that these\nsites use to locate content.\n\n1303\n01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:42,847\nThey're not looking like you or\nI, looking for\n\n1304\n01:08:42,847 --> 01:08:45,530\njust content that renders on a browser.\n\n1305\n01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:47,768\nThey're looking for other stuff, too.\n\n1306\n01:08:47,768 --> 01:08:52,318\nAnd so, and something that we're actually\ngonna talk about in here that kind\n\n1307\n01:08:52,318 --> 01:08:56,940\nof talks more to that is we'll talk\nabout actually downloading websites.\n\n1308\n01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,540\nYou can download pull\nportions of websites and\n\n1309\n01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:02,670\nfind those items that\npeople thought were hidden.\n\n1310\n01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,150\nAnd yes,\nyou will find some interesting things.\n\n1311\n01:09:04,150 --> 01:09:06,720\nYou mentioned passwords,\nI've found credit card numbers that way.\n\n1312\n01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:07,720\n>> Isn't that amazing?\n\n1313\n01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,740\n>> Yeah.\n>> Somebody out there,\n\n1314\n01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,620\nthey decide, well, it'll make it\neasy if I'm out on the road or\n\n1315\n01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:13,845\nwhatever, I can get to it really quickly.\n\n1316\n01:09:13,845 --> 01:09:18,001\nCuz I'm the only one that knows where that\nlink is, knows how to get to that page and\n\n1317\n01:09:18,001 --> 01:09:19,340\nthey are sadly mistaken.\n\n1318\n01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:22,149\n>> Yeah, and\nwhen you find stuff, you need to\n\n1319\n01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:27,380\nreally kind of pay attention to what\ntype of information that really is.\n\n1320\n01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:31,340\nThat could be some stuff that you may need\nto send up a red flag right away and say,\n\n1321\n01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,710\nby the way.\n\n1322\n01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:36,990\nYou find credit card numbers out there,\nyou're probably gonna tell you clients,\n\n1323\n01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:40,810\nthose need to, by the way, I'm not\nwaiting until the end of the report.\n\n1324\n01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:41,730\nI found these things.\n\n1325\n01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:45,640\nYou might wanna close that hole\nright away so there's no problem.\n\n1326\n01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:49,090\n>> Not waiting until the end of your\npenetration test to let them know that.\n\n1327\n01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,950\n>> Or if you're like me and\nethical, you go and\n\n1328\n01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:54,370\ntest your credit card\nnumbers out by buying stuff.\n\n1329\n01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:54,890\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1330\n01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:55,670\n>> That's what I did.\n\n1331\n01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:58,740\n>> Let me verify that these work for\nyou first and\n\n1332\n01:09:58,740 --> 01:10:00,040\nthen I'll let you know that I found them.\n\n1333\n01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,870\n>> You should see my ice hockey\nuniform now, it's awesome.\n\n1334\n01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,083\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Anyway.\n\n1335\n01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:07,520\n>> Ethics people, ethics.\n\n1336\n01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,230\n>> Ethics, yes.\n\n1337\n01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,910\nWe are kidding, we are kidding.\n\n1338\n01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:13,790\n>> I bought the genuine stuff,\nnot the counterfeit, come on.\n\n1339\n01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:19,490\nSo but that's something to, like I said,\nto think about what you find.\n\n1340\n01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:21,590\nBut let's talk about some of\nthe other terms we can use.\n\n1341\n01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:25,640\nInurl is one,\nyou can see how that actually works.\n\n1342\n01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:29,420\nThere's plenty of other\nones that we can go to.\n\n1343\n01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:34,200\nOne that I'll also show you in\nhere is if you type into Google,\n\n1344\n01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,230\nyou can also do this one called filetype.\n\n1345\n01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:38,540\nAnd you can filetype PDF.\n\n1346\n01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:45,270\nAnd if you hit that, notice what it does,\nit brings up results that relate to PDFs.\n\n1347\n01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:48,570\nIt's looking specifically for\nthat and that way,\n\n1348\n01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:51,115\nyou can click on those things and\nsee if that is something that,\n\n1349\n01:10:51,115 --> 01:10:55,095\nif you want to,\nif that is something that you want.\n\n1350\n01:10:55,095 --> 01:11:00,435\nNow, notice in here that I am\nnot putting in a website name.\n\n1351\n01:11:00,435 --> 01:11:05,205\nI am putting, presumably, if I was gonna\ndo this in the real world, I'd do filetype\n\n1352\n01:11:05,205 --> 01:11:09,475\nPDF, and then put in a site name, so it\nnarrows it down to that specific site for\n\n1353\n01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:12,440\nthat target, and look for\nPDFs on that one.\n\n1354\n01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:15,990\nI'm not being that\nsensitive to it right here.\n\n1355\n01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:18,260\nI'm just saying show what the operator is.\n\n1356\n01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:19,790\nEach one of these operators,\n\n1357\n01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:24,960\nyou could actually string those\ntogether however you want.\n\n1358\n01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:27,640\nSo you have a lot of latitude there.\n\n1359\n01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,830\nSo you can see this one found PDFs, and\nI'll tell you, people put PDFs on their\n\n1360\n01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:36,760\nwebsites and they just put them out there\nand they figure out they're not linked.\n\n1361\n01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,960\nI see this a lot, amazingly.\n\n1362\n01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,320\nThey think they're not linked,\nit can't be found, just like you said.\n\n1363\n01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,510\nI've found purchase orders in there\nwith confidential client information.\n\n1364\n01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,920\nA lot of things, and\n\n1365\n01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:50,150\npeople just figure they're not linked to,\nyou can't get to it.\n\n1366\n01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:52,430\nWell, yes, I can get to it.\n\n1367\n01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:55,330\nThat's what we have to\nkind of impress upon them.\n\n1368\n01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:56,894\nYou can't just throw\nsomething up there and\n\n1369\n01:11:56,894 --> 01:11:58,380\nexpect that no one's ever gonna find it.\n\n1370\n01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,000\nIt goes online, someone's gonna find it.\n\n1371\n01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,200\nIt's not if, it's when.\n\n1372\n01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:05,250\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1373\n01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,130\n>> But you can also play\naround with this quite a bit.\n\n1374\n01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,170\nThere are other things that\nI have found that worked.\n\n1375\n01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:16,190\nAnd this is just to show you how you\ncan really kind of tweak things.\n\n1376\n01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:21,500\nI see guys actually, they're putting some\ninteresting things up here to do that.\n\n1377\n01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:25,480\nA search to get credit card numbers.\n\n1378\n01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,510\nOkay.\n\n1379\n01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:30,435\nSomeone needs to talk to James offline.\n\n1380\n01:12:30,435 --> 01:12:34,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You see other ones.\n\n1381\n01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:39,430\nThe site key word, that's another one\ntalking results to a specific site.\n\n1382\n01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:42,250\n>> Like you're talking about\ncombining looking for a PDF but\n\n1383\n01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:45,670\nonly from a particular site, or something\nlike that, your particular target maybe.\n\n1384\n01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:48,180\n>> Yeah, you can actually daisy\nchain stuff together like that and\n\n1385\n01:12:48,180 --> 01:12:49,360\ngo right down the list and\n\n1386\n01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:54,350\nstart putting something together that gets\nbetter results, try different things.\n\n1387\n01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:59,430\nTry a lot of different combinations,\nsee what you get, and you might get\n\n1388\n01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:03,160\nsome interesting results by rearranging\nthings and putting different combinations.\n\n1389\n01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:07,070\nI guarantee when you practice this you'll\nget a lot of interesting combinations.\n\n1390\n01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:13,500\nNow, another one we can use in here is\nI've played around with this for a while,\n\n1391\n01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:16,620\nis doing status and\ntyped in status like green.\n\n1392\n01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:21,120\nAnd then type in this, and I'm gonna\nput a couple things together here.\n\n1393\n01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,770\nStatus green, do Big Brother.\n\n1394\n01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,540\nOkay, so what does that do?\n\n1395\n01:13:25,540 --> 01:13:28,570\nLet's give a little background here for\nthose of you that don't know this.\n\n1396\n01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,230\nBig Brother is a monitoring software for\nnetworks.\n\n1397\n01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:37,220\nIt can monitor hardware, it can monitor\nservers and services on those servers.\n\n1398\n01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:41,690\nSo, you think about it\nsomething like SMS or\n\n1399\n01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:45,290\nSCCM or any, was it Altris, or something.\n\n1400\n01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:47,630\nThere's a bunch of them out there.\n\n1401\n01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:50,760\nI know probably a good\nnumber of you out there have\n\n1402\n01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,170\nthose things loaded on your own network.\n\n1403\n01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:56,050\nI mean, they're great,\nthey make things easy.\n\n1404\n01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:57,750\nWell Big Brother, like I said,\n\n1405\n01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:02,280\nis just one of those many pieces\nof software that do that.\n\n1406\n01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:07,250\nSo what I've done here is I have\nuse of my knowledge of Big Brother.\n\n1407\n01:14:07,250 --> 01:14:12,570\nIt gives status information in green, red,\nor yellow plus a couple of other ones.\n\n1408\n01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:15,580\nAnd so,\nwhat I did is I typed in status as green,\n\n1409\n01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:19,320\nand then typed in Big Brother,\nand got these results.\n\n1410\n01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:24,100\nNow if I click on something,\nif you take a look, it's got a result.\n\n1411\n01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:28,670\nHere's one from yesterday or\nlast results it got was yesterday.\n\n1412\n01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:31,210\nIf you take a look on here,\nlook at the time.\n\n1413\n01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:35,561\nOn March 24, 11:32 Pacific Daylight Time.\n\n1414\n01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:39,170\nSo I've got my computer set to,\nI'm from California.\n\n1415\n01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:40,570\n>> That was about four minutes ago,\nwasn't it?\n\n1416\n01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:42,620\n>> Yeah four or five minutes ago, yeah.\n\n1417\n01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:44,690\nSo this is pretty fresh information.\n\n1418\n01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:48,770\nWhat I have here is, I am looking\ndown this list and I see a lot.\n\n1419\n01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:50,230\nI see stuff in green.\n\n1420\n01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:52,610\nI see some stuff that’s got\nthe little swirly stuff on it.\n\n1421\n01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:55,160\nAnd I see something red and\nflashing over there.\n\n1422\n01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:00,490\nIf you can make it out on your\nscreen right across the top,\n\n1423\n01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:04,790\nit’s got things like connection,\nCPU disk, DNS, stuff like that.\n\n1424\n01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:11,210\nWhat that represents is the services\nrunning on those systems.\n\n1425\n01:15:11,210 --> 01:15:12,310\nIf you look down the list and\n\n1426\n01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:15,660\nsee a blip in that column,\nthat means that service is present.\n\n1427\n01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:20,070\nGreen means it's running okay,\nthe other ones mean different things.\n\n1428\n01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:23,900\nLet's just poke at this a bit and\nsee what we can find.\n\n1429\n01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:25,740\nIf I were to go to CPU,\n\n1430\n01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:28,820\nthat represents what's going on\nwith that CPU in that system.\n\n1431\n01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:33,780\nIf I click on, let's click on this one and\nsee what it tells me.\n\n1432\n01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,270\nSo I click on it.\n\n1433\n01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:36,890\nIt's grinding a bit.\n\n1434\n01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:42,790\nWell, what I'm seeing right here\nis I'm seeing stuff running\n\n1435\n01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000\non that system right now.\n\n1436\n01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,810\nAs of four, five minutes ago,\nsix minutes ago,\n\n1437\n01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:53,200\nI'm seeing what process is running on that\nCPU on that system on the other coast.\n\n1438\n01:15:55,066 --> 01:15:58,800\n>> Those are, and\nI user names with a process ID so\n\n1439\n01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,420\nwe're getting quite a bit of\ninformation back with that.\n\n1440\n01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,860\n>> Yeah, that should make you cringe.\n\n1441\n01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:07,610\nIf you are looking at that,\nyou should definitely be cringing.\n\n1442\n01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:09,430\nAnd you're seeing some\nother stuff up here.\n\n1443\n01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:13,390\nTake a good look at this here, and\n\n1444\n01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:17,760\nwhat I want you to do is I want you to,\nbefore I start talking about this a bit,\n\n1445\n01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,530\ntake a look at this as a little\nkind of test for yourself and\n\n1446\n01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:25,640\nsee, hey, what operating system is this?\n\n1447\n01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:26,950\nSee if you can kind of guess.\n\n1448\n01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:31,590\n>> Can we zoom into that\na little bit Jason?\n\n1449\n01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:34,510\n>> Yeah, see if you can guess\nwhat operating system that is.\n\n1450\n01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:36,489\nI'll give you a moment.\n\n1451\n01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:42,700\nBut you can pretty much\ninfer what that is.\n\n1452\n01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:45,370\nYou're probably pretty close.\n\n1453\n01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:48,310\nLook at the results, look at that.\n\n1454\n01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,870\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1455\n01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,690\n>> I told you you're going to be paranoid,\n\n1456\n01:16:53,690 --> 01:16:54,300\nall right?\n\n1457\n01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,140\nCalm down.\n\n1458\n01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:58,000\nThe sky isn't falling, all right?\n\n1459\n01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,130\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n1460\n01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:06,010\n>> So the thing is, you look at that,\nit's probably more unlikely.\n\n1461\n01:17:06,010 --> 01:17:08,715\nI see we've got some guys in\nthe discussion group just saying it.\n\n1462\n01:17:08,715 --> 01:17:10,088\n>> They figured it out, didn't they?\n\n1463\n01:17:10,088 --> 01:17:11,669\n>> Yeah, it's either Linux or Unix.\n\n1464\n01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:15,280\nI probably, and\nI see Fabian saying it's a Nix system.\n\n1465\n01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:21,030\n>> Yeah, cuz you see things like,\nwhat was that, Syslog and stuff in there.\n\n1466\n01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:25,440\n>> Yeah, there's stuff that indicates,\nI mean if you look at the username,\n\n1467\n01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,492\nthat may be where Fabian's getting\nhis kind of assessments from.\n\n1468\n01:17:29,492 --> 01:17:30,528\n>> Roots?\n\n1469\n01:17:30,528 --> 01:17:34,730\n>> Is, yeah, root's probably your best\nindicator on what that actually is.\n\n1470\n01:17:34,730 --> 01:17:38,599\nSo and then if you look up top it's\nalready telling you what the resources\n\n1471\n01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:39,620\non the system are.\n\n1472\n01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:40,380\n>> Right.\n\n1473\n01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,684\n>> So\nwe're getting a good bit of stuff in here.\n\n1474\n01:17:43,684 --> 01:17:48,783\nAnd then, going back in here you\ncan see I can get stuff for what's\n\n1475\n01:17:48,783 --> 01:17:54,836\naccessing the disk, or what the structure\nof the disk is, if I click on that.\n\n1476\n01:17:54,836 --> 01:17:57,789\n>> [LAUGH] I don't know,\nto me, I know this stuff, and\n\n1477\n01:17:57,789 --> 01:18:01,800\nI've seen it before, but\nevery time I see it it just shocks me.\n\n1478\n01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,048\nThis is stuff that we found\nwith a search engine.\n\n1479\n01:18:04,048 --> 01:18:05,758\nMind boggling.\n\n1480\n01:18:05,758 --> 01:18:10,490\n>> Yeah, and I could have gone through and\ntalked about this, and yacked about it,\n\n1481\n01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:15,660\nand said okay, here is some snapshots or\nsomething, I could have done that.\n\n1482\n01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:19,360\nJust, I wanted you guys to know there\nis no videos or anything running here,\n\n1483\n01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,060\nthis is all done in real time.\n\n1484\n01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:22,100\n>> Live and real time.\n\n1485\n01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:26,000\n>> You guys saw I'm not pulling any kind\nof weird black magic or funny stuff here,\n\n1486\n01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,230\nI did it right here in real time.\n\n1487\n01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,770\nAnd look at how far I've actually gotten.\n\n1488\n01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:31,610\n>> Right.\n\n1489\n01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:35,050\n>> That should give you pause.\n\n1490\n01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:38,190\nSo you can see quite a bit.\n\n1491\n01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:42,460\nNow let's also kind of scroll down here\na bit and see what else we can find.\n\n1492\n01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:45,550\nOh look, switches and routers!\n\n1493\n01:18:47,570 --> 01:18:50,320\nNot too much,\nnot a ton I can do with that, right.\n\n1494\n01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:54,240\nI mean it's not like that's\nsensitive information or anything.\n\n1495\n01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,310\nSo, you're getting,\nthey're giving a lot of stuff,\n\n1496\n01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:00,630\nyou know, a lot of stuff away to me.\n\n1497\n01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,240\nI can click on these things, any of\nthese little, blips I can click on and\n\n1498\n01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,158\nget some insight into\noh that's your system?\n\n1499\n01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:11,890\n>> [LAUGH] Sorry Kevin.\n\n1500\n01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:15,625\n>> Anything you want me\nto fix while I'm in here?\n\n1501\n01:19:15,625 --> 01:19:21,195\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, so you've got quite a bit\n\n1502\n01:19:21,195 --> 01:19:27,820\nhere that can really kind\nof ruin someone's day.\n\n1503\n01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:29,120\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1504\n01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,640\n>> This would be something that hey,\nyou're just writing it down and\n\n1505\n01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,070\ndocumenting it.\n\n1506\n01:19:33,070 --> 01:19:36,860\nNow, let me kind of tell you the thinking\nthat gets you into this problem.\n\n1507\n01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:38,660\nI think it's important to\nkind of talk about that.\n\n1508\n01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:41,150\nWhy does someone get into this?\n\n1509\n01:19:41,150 --> 01:19:44,330\nWhat I've noticed, is if you look at\nsomething like Big Brother, it's not\n\n1510\n01:19:44,330 --> 01:19:50,490\nthe only system that says this, but\nit says, we've got a web enabled product.\n\n1511\n01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,640\nOkay?\n\n1512\n01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,660\nIt doesn't sound bad right?\n\n1513\n01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,870\nYou know say, web enabled.\n\n1514\n01:19:53,870 --> 01:19:54,660\n>> Sounds convenient.\n\n1515\n01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:55,660\nI like it.\n>> Yeah, it does.\n\n1516\n01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,170\nRight?\nIt sounds really convenient.\n\n1517\n01:19:57,170 --> 01:19:59,920\nBut think of what it puts in someone's\nhead when you say, web enabled.\n\n1518\n01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,927\nOh, web enabled, Internet is\nthe next logical step from there.\n\n1519\n01:20:03,927 --> 01:20:08,151\nAnd so I've noticed that when people hear,\na lot of times people hear web,\n\n1520\n01:20:08,151 --> 01:20:09,840\nthey make that association.\n\n1521\n01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,300\nSay, oh, well it's web enabled.\n\n1522\n01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,970\nWouldn't it be great to\naccess this from anywhere?\n\n1523\n01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:16,910\nI'm not saying you shouldn't\nmake it like this, but\n\n1524\n01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:20,465\nas I saw some of you mentioning here.\n\n1525\n01:20:20,465 --> 01:20:25,275\nWhat about SSL,\nwhat about using even a VPN?\n\n1526\n01:20:25,275 --> 01:20:27,145\nSomething like that to access this.\n\n1527\n01:20:27,145 --> 01:20:28,475\nYou can access it remotely,\n\n1528\n01:20:28,475 --> 01:20:32,495\nI'm not telling you oh don't wait to,\nor don't implement this.\n\n1529\n01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:38,375\nWait and stop or whatever you're doing,\nno, use your layers of security.\n\n1530\n01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,205\nUse a SSL,\nuse a VPN to make it more secure,\n\n1531\n01:20:42,205 --> 01:20:45,460\nyou can definitely do that and\nstill get this functionality.\n\n1532\n01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:49,490\nHaving this just stuck out there,\nis inviting trouble.\n\n1533\n01:20:49,490 --> 01:20:50,540\n>> Yes.\n>> It's just inviting,\n\n1534\n01:20:50,540 --> 01:20:52,770\nsomeone's gonna go through and find that.\n\n1535\n01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:55,280\nSo don't find yourself in that.\n\n1536\n01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,040\nI like to think of,\ninstead of saying web interfaces,\n\n1537\n01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,350\nsay it's a browser based interface,\nthat's a better term.\n\n1538\n01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:03,870\n>> Kind of giving me the indicate,\nnot necessarily indicating Internet,\n\n1539\n01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:05,940\nbut intranet or keeping it in-house.\n\n1540\n01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:08,580\nAnd then, as you're saying,\nno reason I can't access from anywhere,\n\n1541\n01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,210\nbut don't expose it to the Internet.\n\n1542\n01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:14,570\nVPN in, and then access that\nweb server as a local resource.\n\n1543\n01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:18,350\nYeah, just mind boggling, crazy.\n\n1544\n01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,600\n>> And look, if you will for\n\n1545\n01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,670\na moment, look at the search\nresults I got for Google.\n\n1546\n01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:28,170\nYeah, I just clicked on\nthis top one in here,\n\n1547\n01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:30,290\nif we can zoom in on this a bit more.\n\n1548\n01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:34,989\nIf you go down this list, look at this URL\n\n1549\n01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:39,689\nright here, what's at the front of it,\n\n1550\n01:21:39,689 --> 01:21:44,685\nthe first part right here with WISC.edu.\n\n1551\n01:21:44,685 --> 01:21:45,645\n>> Right.\n\n1552\n01:21:45,645 --> 01:21:48,875\n>> I'm pretty sure that's\na college someplace.\n\n1553\n01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:51,785\nAnd then I've got another one\nunderneath it from the same place.\n\n1554\n01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:56,625\n>> And the list goes on and\nthis is just our first page of results.\n\n1555\n01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:57,515\n>> Yeah.\n\n1556\n01:21:57,515 --> 01:21:58,015\n>> And there they are.\n\n1557\n01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:02,360\n>> Yeah, we're getting\ninformation that is very current.\n\n1558\n01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,960\nThat should just not be there.\n\n1559\n01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:08,900\nSo, think about this.\n\n1560\n01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:11,630\nThink about this stuff\nwhen you're doing it.\n\n1561\n01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:15,030\nAnd I'm glad to see the reactions that\nwe're getting in this chat room here.\n\n1562\n01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,960\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1563\n01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,715\n>> That's kinda what I want to see cuz\nthe people that are seeing this are gonna\n\n1564\n01:22:19,715 --> 01:22:21,634\nthink twice about this type of stuff.\n\n1565\n01:22:21,634 --> 01:22:26,290\nAnd you kind of opened your eyes\nquite a bit going wow really?\n\n1566\n01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:29,415\nThat's what I like to see cuz\nhopefully you see the stuff, and\n\n1567\n01:22:29,415 --> 01:22:33,115\nwe'll re-assess maybe some of\nthose choices and decisions.\n\n1568\n01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:36,975\nI'm not saying you're doing anything\nwrong, but think about this type of stuff.\n\n1569\n01:22:36,975 --> 01:22:38,585\nAnd let me tell you,\n\n1570\n01:22:38,585 --> 01:22:42,167\nsomething else I've seen on this,\nI've done this search before.\n\n1571\n01:22:42,167 --> 01:22:46,832\nOne of the searches that I've done is I\nclicked on this and what happens is when I\n\n1572\n01:22:46,832 --> 01:22:51,090\nclick on it, I saw one where the page\ncame up and displayed everything.\n\n1573\n01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,293\nAnd then it brought a login dialog came\nup and said put your user name and\n\n1574\n01:22:54,293 --> 01:22:54,957\npassword in.\n\n1575\n01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:00,100\nThink about what I just said,\nit brought the results page up and\n\n1576\n01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:00,920\nthen put a password.\n\n1577\n01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:02,737\nSo what-\n>> So\n\n1578\n01:23:02,737 --> 01:23:04,540\nI can just move that over to the side.\n\n1579\n01:23:04,540 --> 01:23:05,250\n>> Yeah, I could drag it over.\n\n1580\n01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:08,940\nI could close it and it would still\nshow me the results in there.\n\n1581\n01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:12,320\nThere was so many levels of wrong\nwith that I can't even get into it.\n\n1582\n01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,031\nAnd you could click on links, too,\neven though it showed the password,\n\n1583\n01:23:15,031 --> 01:23:16,008\nyou click on links in there.\n\n1584\n01:23:16,008 --> 01:23:18,540\nIt would take you to the next one and\nthe password would pop up again.\n\n1585\n01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:21,765\nIt was kind of like someone going excuse\nme, like, go away kid you're bothering me.\n\n1586\n01:23:21,765 --> 01:23:24,568\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You could keep doing that over and\n\n1587\n01:23:24,568 --> 01:23:27,706\nover again and\nit would just say okay, I'm fine,\n\n1588\n01:23:27,706 --> 01:23:30,360\nyou can browse whatever you want, okay?\n\n1589\n01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,945\nThat's not good security,\nit just really isn't.\n\n1590\n01:23:32,945 --> 01:23:36,247\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well I tell\nyou what, looking at the clock,\n\n1591\n01:23:36,247 --> 01:23:38,800\nit's about time for\nus to wrap up this segment.\n\n1592\n01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,444\nSo why don't we let you digest some\nof that information that you just saw\n\n1593\n01:23:42,444 --> 01:23:43,000\nin there.\n\n1594\n01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,480\nWhen we come back,\nwe're gonna continue on.\n\n1595\n01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:46,310\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1596\n01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:53,549\n[SOUND].\n\n1597\n01:23:53,549 --> 01:23:55,270\nAll right, welcome back everyone.\n\n1598\n01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:58,760\nSo we're gonna continue on with\nour topic of Google hacking.\n\n1599\n01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:03,930\nAnd now we're gonna take a look at\nnext the Google hacking database.\n\n1600\n01:24:03,930 --> 01:24:09,136\n>> Yeah, I don't think we can really\ngo too far on the topic of Google\n\n1601\n01:24:09,136 --> 01:24:14,540\nhacking without including\nthe Google hacking database.\n\n1602\n01:24:14,540 --> 01:24:19,820\nIt's just a great source\nof information for us.\n\n1603\n01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,440\nWe talked about Google hacking on its own,\n\n1604\n01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:28,220\nof course, we talked about what you\ncan do with just some of the keywords.\n\n1605\n01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:33,070\nAnd remember people, I talked about\na very small number of the keywords.\n\n1606\n01:24:33,070 --> 01:24:34,660\nI didn't talk about them all.\n\n1607\n01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:37,940\nWe just don't have time\nto do them all here.\n\n1608\n01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:43,140\nBut you've seen the format and\nthe syntax of them, the way they flow.\n\n1609\n01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:46,280\nThat should give you enough to\nexplore some of the different results,\n\n1610\n01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,780\nwhich is what I wanna encourage.\n\n1611\n01:24:47,780 --> 01:24:50,960\nAnd that's another reason why I'm like\nokay, there's a lot of them out there.\n\n1612\n01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,530\nI want you to try it,\nI showed you how they work, try them.\n\n1613\n01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:57,390\nI want you to explore and get a feel for\nthem, it's a great thing.\n\n1614\n01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,970\nSo we've got that.\n\n1615\n01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:05,040\nBut what if you wanna go and\ntry some different ones, and\n\n1616\n01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,250\nsee what types of possibilities there are.\n\n1617\n01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:11,835\nInstead of just, some people experimenting\nmight with the different keywords thinks\n\n1618\n01:25:11,835 --> 01:25:14,950\nit's the equivalent of\njust stumbling around.\n\n1619\n01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:18,210\nWhat if they want to kinda get an idea\nof what type of results you can expect\n\n1620\n01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:20,130\nby chaining things together?\n\n1621\n01:25:20,130 --> 01:25:23,390\nWell, that's exactly what the Google\nhacking data base comes in.\n\n1622\n01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:28,324\nThe Google hacking data base gives\nyou a nice place to go to to see just\n\n1623\n01:25:28,324 --> 01:25:31,095\nwhat is possible with Google hacks and\n\n1624\n01:25:31,095 --> 01:25:36,970\nthe types of information you can get,\nso really a great resource for us.\n\n1625\n01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:40,670\nWhat I have here on my screen\nis the Google hacking database.\n\n1626\n01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:44,720\nYou can just type in ghdb and\n\n1627\n01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:50,550\nyou will get this website that's\nthe ghdb under hackers for charity.\n\n1628\n01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:54,070\nIt's been around for quite a while.\n\n1629\n01:25:54,070 --> 01:26:00,560\nThe same name that I saw mentioned in\nthe discussion groups here, Johnny Long.\n\n1630\n01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:02,200\nHe's the same guy behind this.\n\n1631\n01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:05,765\nHe had a previous site before,\nit was ihackstuff or something.\n\n1632\n01:26:05,765 --> 01:26:07,730\n>> ihackstuff.org I think it was, yeah.\n\n1633\n01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,490\n>> Yeah.\n>> He wrote a good book on it.\n\n1634\n01:26:09,490 --> 01:26:10,305\n>> Yeah, he did.\n\n1635\n01:26:10,305 --> 01:26:13,142\n>> So you've got that as a resource,\n\n1636\n01:26:13,142 --> 01:26:18,770\nyou've got books of his as a resource,\nbut you also have this.\n\n1637\n01:26:18,770 --> 01:26:21,730\nNow, granted,\nit's not updated all that often.\n\n1638\n01:26:21,730 --> 01:26:25,450\nBut it really doesn't need to be, these\nGoogle hacks have been around for awhile.\n\n1639\n01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:30,700\nWhat we are seeing here on this page,\nwe're seeing a list of Google hacks.\n\n1640\n01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,360\nAnd, well kind of a general\nlook at Google hacks.\n\n1641\n01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:37,450\nYou don't see them right away,\nsee the Google hacks themselves.\n\n1642\n01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:41,630\nWhat you're seeing here, is your seeing\nlists of things that can come across,\n\n1643\n01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:45,140\nand these are all very useful,\nvery, very useful.\n\n1644\n01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:47,380\n>> Absolutely, absolutely yeah.\n\n1645\n01:26:47,380 --> 01:26:50,780\nAnd then we got a whole module,\nwe're gonna talk about SQL injection and\n\n1646\n01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,850\nthings like that.\n\n1647\n01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:54,446\nOne of the things you need is a SQLl log\non page to do our little test to see\n\n1648\n01:26:54,446 --> 01:26:56,077\nif they're going to be vulnerable to that.\n\n1649\n01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:59,412\nAnd they got a search right there\nthat will pull up log on pages, so\n\n1650\n01:26:59,412 --> 01:27:00,940\nit makes it very convenient.\n\n1651\n01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:05,676\n>> Yeah, exactly,\nit doesn't really get much nicer than\n\n1652\n01:27:05,676 --> 01:27:10,040\nthe stuff you have here with Google hacks.\n\n1653\n01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:11,340\nWhat we're seeing here is,\n\n1654\n01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:16,730\nlet's just kind of poke through some of\nthe possibilities here while we have it.\n\n1655\n01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:19,790\nOne I like to look at is these\nfiles containing passwords.\n\n1656\n01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:22,390\n>> And that hasn't changed in\nthe ten years I've been doing that.\n\n1657\n01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:26,690\nI'm trying to think when I first\nlearned about Johnny, ihackstuff.org.\n\n1658\n01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:27,600\n>> Break his website.\n\n1659\n01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,230\n>> But for the love of God,\npasswords for the love of God [LAUGH].\n\n1660\n01:27:32,230 --> 01:27:36,282\n>> Okay, I got an error for a sec,\nand then I refreshed, it came back.\n\n1661\n01:27:36,282 --> 01:27:39,710\nSo, but anyway,\n\n1662\n01:27:39,710 --> 01:27:43,940\nwhat I have here is I have\na list of things you can do.\n\n1663\n01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:47,076\nYou can see the title,\nthat says what the Google hack is and\n\n1664\n01:27:47,076 --> 01:27:49,380\nthen the summary of what it does, though.\n\n1665\n01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:53,590\nSo it's telling you, okay, here's some\nof our Google hacks in the second one.\n\n1666\n01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:57,710\nIntitle, intext,\none we didn't look at specifically.\n\n1667\n01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:58,750\nSo we've got some stuff.\n\n1668\n01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:00,000\nHe tells you what it does.\n\n1669\n01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,660\nYou can keep going down this list and\nfinding different things.\n\n1670\n01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:08,670\nNow, they may not be immediately\nobvious to you what all these do.\n\n1671\n01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:10,020\nBut these are all Google hacks.\n\n1672\n01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:14,675\nI mean, look at this one, file type xls,\nand look for the user name, password,\n\n1673\n01:28:14,675 --> 01:28:15,390\nand email.\n\n1674\n01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:19,890\n>> Somebody's got a spreadsheet on their\nwebsite somewhere that has username,\n\n1675\n01:28:19,890 --> 01:28:22,160\npassword, sitting right there\nin an Excel spreadsheet.\n\n1676\n01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:24,300\n>> Yeah, in fact, you know,\nlet's take a look at that one.\n\n1677\n01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,169\n>> Let's do it.\nLet's click on that.\n\n1678\n01:28:25,169 --> 01:28:29,093\n>> I'm just picking this out, I'm picking\nthis up, I'm doing this totally at random,\n\n1679\n01:28:29,093 --> 01:28:30,986\nwhich means I planned it like a month ago.\n\n1680\n01:28:30,986 --> 01:28:32,895\n[LAUGH] I'm kidding.\n\n1681\n01:28:32,895 --> 01:28:35,609\nIf you click on that blue eye,\n\n1682\n01:28:35,609 --> 01:28:41,220\nit brings up a more specific\ncomment on what's going on.\n\n1683\n01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:43,930\nBut if you click on this\nGoogle search up here,\n\n1684\n01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:47,590\nit will bring up a tab\nshowing the resource.\n\n1685\n01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:50,340\nSo we look at this thing,\nwe see a bunch of XLS files.\n\n1686\n01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,950\nExactly what we would expect to see.\n\n1687\n01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:57,850\nWe did file type for PDFs, we saw what\nthe result was, we're seeing that here.\n\n1688\n01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:01,055\nNow let's kinda look at these results and\nsee what comes up.\n\n1689\n01:29:01,055 --> 01:29:05,345\nI'm just gonna click one at,\nlike I said, totally at random here,\n\n1690\n01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:07,243\nI clicked on that first link.\n\n1691\n01:29:07,243 --> 01:29:09,083\nI'm gonna say open this thing up.\n\n1692\n01:29:09,083 --> 01:29:11,236\nAnd let's just see, let's do a drum roll.\n\n1693\n01:29:11,236 --> 01:29:14,958\n>> [LAUGH] I almost thought that\nsaid Alachua County for a second.\n\n1694\n01:29:14,958 --> 01:29:17,637\nI was getting a little nervous,\nthose are our local sheriffs down there.\n\n1695\n01:29:17,637 --> 01:29:22,161\n[LAUGH]\n>> So look at what we found here.\n\n1696\n01:29:22,161 --> 01:29:27,032\nWe found some information, but\nif you look over in that column,\n\n1697\n01:29:27,032 --> 01:29:28,712\nthat column D, look what it has.\n\n1698\n01:29:30,392 --> 01:29:31,332\nLook what it's got.\n\n1699\n01:29:31,332 --> 01:29:33,597\nIt's got username and password.\n\n1700\n01:29:33,597 --> 01:29:35,242\nIt's telling you where to use that.\n\n1701\n01:29:36,692 --> 01:29:41,652\nSo why this looks like this is a school\nsomeplace, middle and high school.\n\n1702\n01:29:41,652 --> 01:29:43,182\nIt's not a national security issue,\n\n1703\n01:29:43,182 --> 01:29:49,150\nit is something that is kind of\nconcerning to see that there.\n\n1704\n01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,080\nAnd they're not the only ones.\n\n1705\n01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,910\nThey're definitely not the only ones\nout there that have this type of\n\n1706\n01:29:53,910 --> 01:29:55,280\ninformation posted.\n\n1707\n01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,260\nYou can go through this list.\n\n1708\n01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:03,450\nI could close that out and go back and\nlook at the other things in here.\n\n1709\n01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:06,000\nSocial media websites, login details.\n\n1710\n01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,590\nI may not get anything.\n\n1711\n01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:11,490\nI may get a spreadsheet that\nhas really nothing in it.\n\n1712\n01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:15,710\n>> It could be public information in\nit that they're okay making available.\n\n1713\n01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:17,830\nBut as you go through\nthose different results,\n\n1714\n01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:20,533\nodds are, cuz you've got dozens\nof pages of results there,\n\n1715\n01:30:20,533 --> 01:30:24,790\nwe could take our time and thumb through\nand probably find some juicy information.\n\n1716\n01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:25,421\n>> Yeah.\n\n1717\n01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:26,520\nExactly.\n\n1718\n01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,240\nAnd you could really tweak\nthese searches if you want.\n\n1719\n01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:30,730\nI'm looking at something here,\n\n1720\n01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:34,130\nand it doesn't really look like\nit's anything all that juicy.\n\n1721\n01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:36,230\nBut there are different tabs down here.\n\n1722\n01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:41,560\nWell, it is telling me, hey,\nlook at email, password, username.\n\n1723\n01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:46,040\nYou know, what do I have to say here?\n\n1724\n01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:46,580\nReally?\n\n1725\n01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:49,450\n>> I don't think we can really\ncomment on that at all.\n\n1726\n01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:51,145\nJust kind of stare at that for\na second, guys.\n\n1727\n01:30:51,145 --> 01:30:54,450\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, like I said, this is something\n\n1728\n01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:59,990\nthat maybe they put up there as a test,\nmaybe it's something else.\n\n1729\n01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:02,891\nBut it is up there,\nit is definitely up there.\n\n1730\n01:31:02,891 --> 01:31:06,182\nAnd we're all looking at it together.\n\n1731\n01:31:06,182 --> 01:31:08,040\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1732\n01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,744\nAnd we just touched the tip of the iceberg\nreally when it comes to the Google\n\n1733\n01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:15,200\nhacking, so\nyou can really take this pretty far.\n\n1734\n01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:17,088\n>> Yeah,\nyou can really go to town on this one.\n\n1735\n01:31:17,088 --> 01:31:22,082\nAnd here's the thing with something\nlike this is that when you go to\n\n1736\n01:31:22,082 --> 01:31:27,074\nthe numeration phase and\nthe gaining access stage, you can look at\n\n1737\n01:31:27,074 --> 01:31:32,624\nsomething like this that you've found and\nI've got usernames in there.\n\n1738\n01:31:32,624 --> 01:31:34,226\n>> Yeah,\neven if I didn't get the passwords,\n\n1739\n01:31:34,226 --> 01:31:35,971\nif we need two things to authenticate,\nright?\n\n1740\n01:31:35,971 --> 01:31:38,510\nI need a user name and I need a password.\n\n1741\n01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,858\nThere's half the puzzle right there.\n\n1742\n01:31:39,858 --> 01:31:41,700\nRight, so\nall I've got left is to get the password.\n\n1743\n01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:45,340\n>> Yeah, this could very much be\nthat thing that lets me in and\n\n1744\n01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:49,460\nI don't even have to do much for\nmy actual hacking.\n\n1745\n01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:53,720\nI can just go ahead and\nuse these things right away.\n\n1746\n01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:56,177\n>> I'm dying to know what the one down\nthere at the bottom of your screen says,\n\n1747\n01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:56,804\npasswords.xls.\n\n1748\n01:31:56,804 --> 01:31:59,671\n[LAUGH] I just gotta see it.\n\n1749\n01:31:59,671 --> 01:32:03,046\n>> All right, well, let's go ahead and\ntake a look at it together and\n\n1750\n01:32:03,046 --> 01:32:03,902\nsee what we got.\n\n1751\n01:32:03,902 --> 01:32:06,132\n>> It could be just a form like\nhow to fill out the password or\n\n1752\n01:32:06,132 --> 01:32:08,420\nsomething like that, or\nit could be a list of passwords.\n\n1753\n01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:09,745\n>> I've run into that, actually.\n\n1754\n01:32:09,745 --> 01:32:12,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No,\n\n1755\n01:32:12,870 --> 01:32:14,270\nthat's a-\n>> Email,\n\n1756\n01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:18,310\nusername, password, look at that.\n\n1757\n01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,217\nHm, interesting stuff.\n\n1758\n01:32:19,217 --> 01:32:23,728\n>> There's really not\na ton you can say here.\n\n1759\n01:32:23,728 --> 01:32:31,032\nI can give you a second to pick your jaw\nup off the floor, but it's a big mistake.\n\n1760\n01:32:31,032 --> 01:32:33,259\nIf you want to document stuff like this,\n\n1761\n01:32:33,259 --> 01:32:37,920\nkeep in mind I'm not gonna go to a client\nand say, hey, don't document this stuff.\n\n1762\n01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,380\nYou wanna document it, fine.\n\n1763\n01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:43,680\nThere's been that saying for a long time,\ndon't write down usernames and passwords.\n\n1764\n01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,235\nNo, that really should be don't\nwrite them down in such a way,\n\n1765\n01:32:46,235 --> 01:32:48,610\ndon't write them down someplace\nwhere they're easily found.\n\n1766\n01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:49,730\n>> Thank you.\n>> Put them in a safe,\n\n1767\n01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,210\nencrypt them, something like that.\n\n1768\n01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:53,640\nThat is okay.\n\n1769\n01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,630\nI understand, as well as anybody that\nthinks about it for a moment or two,\n\n1770\n01:32:57,630 --> 01:33:00,430\nwe understand that there's\na lot of credentials out there.\n\n1771\n01:33:00,430 --> 01:33:04,900\n>> It's one of the things I think I've had\nthe hardest times explaining to people cuz\n\n1772\n01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,160\neverybody knows that,\ndon't write passwords down.\n\n1773\n01:33:07,160 --> 01:33:09,700\nAnd I think it's a horrible\nthing to teach people because\n\n1774\n01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,780\nyou're gonna have to write them down.\n\n1775\n01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:13,350\nIf I tell them that they\ncan't write them down,\n\n1776\n01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:16,160\nto me that means they're gonna be using\nthe same password for everything cuz\n\n1777\n01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,490\nI can't remember 20 different\npasswords for 20 different logins.\n\n1778\n01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:24,500\nAll of them long, all of them strong, all\nof them being changed every 30 to 45 days.\n\n1779\n01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:25,410\nSo you can write them down,\n\n1780\n01:33:25,410 --> 01:33:28,940\nit's how you write them down and\nwhat you do with that afterwards.\n\n1781\n01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:32,155\nHow many people can get into your wallet\nwithout you knowing about it, or ladies,\n\n1782\n01:33:32,155 --> 01:33:32,905\nget into your purse.\n\n1783\n01:33:32,905 --> 01:33:34,935\nOr like you said, if it's a company thing,\n\n1784\n01:33:34,935 --> 01:33:37,585\nwe've got secure locations where\nwe can store those documents.\n\n1785\n01:33:37,585 --> 01:33:40,300\nOur web server is not one of them.\n\n1786\n01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:40,835\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1787\n01:33:40,835 --> 01:33:44,685\nexact wrong place to be\nstoring these things.\n\n1788\n01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:49,665\nI like the way you put this in here.\n\n1789\n01:33:49,665 --> 01:33:52,115\nOne of the things you mentioned there is,\n\n1790\n01:33:52,115 --> 01:33:54,555\nwhat are people gonna do if you\ntell them not to write stuff down?\n\n1791\n01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:57,880\nThey're gonna start reusing things.\n\n1792\n01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:58,460\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1793\n01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:01,900\n>> And\nthat is something that works against us.\n\n1794\n01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:04,760\nNow, I'm not necessarily gonna tell you,\nand I know there might be some\n\n1795\n01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:07,741\nsecurity experts out there that are going,\nno, I didn't hear what you're saying.\n\n1796\n01:34:07,741 --> 01:34:09,569\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not gonna tell you to\n\n1797\n01:34:09,569 --> 01:34:11,579\nuse a different password for every site.\n\n1798\n01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:13,309\nYeah, ideally if you could, go for it.\n\n1799\n01:34:13,309 --> 01:34:15,680\nBut I think that's a little much.\n\n1800\n01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:18,120\nBut you kind of need to pick your battles.\n\n1801\n01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:22,231\nThe more sensitive websites, like\nbanking websites, and stuff like that,\n\n1802\n01:34:22,231 --> 01:34:24,450\nthose should use unique passwords.\n\n1803\n01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:28,546\nBut other things that are less sensitive,\nyou could probably get away with\n\n1804\n01:34:28,546 --> 01:34:31,215\nreusing a password there\n>> I\n\n1805\n01:34:31,215 --> 01:34:33,780\nhave my newsgroup password\nthat I typically use for\n\n1806\n01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:36,370\nall the different newsgroups that I\nbelong to or something like that.\n\n1807\n01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:38,840\nBut it's not the same password I use for\nBank of America, right?\n\n1808\n01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,470\nThat's a unique, strong password,\n\n1809\n01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:44,960\nso that way I minimize the number of\npasswords overall that I gotta remember.\n\n1810\n01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:47,800\nAnd a bunch of people in the chat room are\nmentioning several different programs that\n\n1811\n01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:51,250\nyou could use,\nLast Pass being one of my favorites.\n\n1812\n01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:53,590\nBut there's a lot of ways\nyou can go about that.\n\n1813\n01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:55,600\nBut really we're probably\ngetting a little off topic.\n\n1814\n01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,590\nWe can talk all day about long and strong\npasswords and how to secure those as well.\n\n1815\n01:35:00,940 --> 01:35:04,670\nBut so back to the Google hacking,\njust use password 12345.\n\n1816\n01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:07,150\n>> Like Claudius's thing,\ntheir new password, 12345.\n\n1817\n01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:10,430\nEvery time someone says that,\nwhen you wanna say\n\n1818\n01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:13,722\nthat's the type of combination some\nidiot puts on their luggage, right?\n\n1819\n01:35:13,722 --> 01:35:14,485\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1820\n01:35:14,485 --> 01:35:17,917\n>> I know you've all seen Spaceballs so\ndon't act like you haven't.\n\n1821\n01:35:17,917 --> 01:35:20,870\n[LAUGH]\n>> And I gotta change my combination up\n\n1822\n01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:21,464\nhere.\n\n1823\n01:35:21,464 --> 01:35:24,030\n[LAUGH] Now I've been to\nseveral places where I\n\n1824\n01:35:24,030 --> 01:35:27,640\nwas doing some work at a doctor's\noffice and I needed to get in and\n\n1825\n01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,250\naccess their information to\nset up this training session.\n\n1826\n01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,370\nAnd of course he wasn't\nthere when I got there.\n\n1827\n01:35:32,370 --> 01:35:34,390\nSo he's like, you can go ahead and\nlog onto my system and\n\n1828\n01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:35,520\nget access to the information.\n\n1829\n01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:38,110\nAnd I was like, what's your,\nyou're gonna give me your password?\n\n1830\n01:35:38,110 --> 01:35:39,450\nHe's like, oh yeah, I don't mind.\n\n1831\n01:35:39,450 --> 01:35:41,546\nAnd so he gives me his password,\nhe's like, oh, I said that didn't work.\n\n1832\n01:35:41,546 --> 01:35:43,113\nHe's like, try 12345.\n\n1833\n01:35:43,113 --> 01:35:44,832\nSure enough, that was his password.\n\n1834\n01:35:44,832 --> 01:35:48,380\nAnd this was the doc,\none of the admins at the hospital.\n\n1835\n01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:49,080\nCrazy.\nCrazy,\n\n1836\n01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:52,000\none that he's gonna share his password\nwith me, two that it's 12345.\n\n1837\n01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,300\n>> How many levels of wrong can you say?\n\n1838\n01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:58,800\nWhere can you start on that, really?\n\n1839\n01:35:58,800 --> 01:35:59,670\n>> Oh, shoot.\n\n1840\n01:35:59,670 --> 01:36:01,170\nSo Google hacking database.\n\n1841\n01:36:01,170 --> 01:36:05,655\nAgain it's just a great place to start if\nyou're getting into Google hacking, or\n\n1842\n01:36:05,655 --> 01:36:10,220\nlearning how to use Google to find this\ninformation in your footprinting process.\n\n1843\n01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:12,562\nBecause really that's what\nwe're talking about today,\n\n1844\n01:36:12,562 --> 01:36:14,780\nis just gathering all that information.\n\n1845\n01:36:14,780 --> 01:36:16,400\nDifferent ways that I can get it.\n\n1846\n01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,090\nAnd now you can see that we can take\nadvantage of these search engines.\n\n1847\n01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:22,040\nWe can leverage some of the power\nof these search engines and\n\n1848\n01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:24,570\nusing different operators in our searches\n\n1849\n01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:28,040\nto really refine the information that\nwe're getting back and be very specific.\n\n1850\n01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:31,930\nResults that we never would have gotten\nhad we just typed in passwords, right.\n\n1851\n01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:33,960\nI mean,\nwe're not going to see these things.\n\n1852\n01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,820\nBut we start playing around with\nthe search engine and the operators and\n\n1853\n01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,059\nwe can get some interesting results.\n\n1854\n01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:41,750\nHacking database isn't the only one,\nright?\n\n1855\n01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,110\nWe got a couple others, or another one.\n\n1856\n01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:46,740\n>> It's definitely not\nthe only one out there.\n\n1857\n01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:50,959\nAnd I think it would probably be\neven be better to put it this way.\n\n1858\n01:36:50,959 --> 01:36:56,853\nIs that you could conceivably\ntype password into Google,\n\n1859\n01:36:56,853 --> 01:37:04,270\nand you're gonna get results,\nyou might get the results you want.\n\n1860\n01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:08,329\nBut as the old saying goes,\neven a broken clock is right twice a day.\n\n1861\n01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:10,417\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> So you'll get there eventually.\n\n1862\n01:37:10,417 --> 01:37:14,144\nYou don't want to do things eventually,\nyou wanna get in there and get out.\n\n1863\n01:37:14,144 --> 01:37:17,006\nThis has to be a very perfected,\nvery streamlined process.\n\n1864\n01:37:17,006 --> 01:37:20,298\nSo, using Google hacking gets\nyou the results that you want,\n\n1865\n01:37:20,298 --> 01:37:22,842\npresumably gets you\nthe results that you want.\n\n1866\n01:37:22,842 --> 01:37:27,500\nGet them quicker and\nget you moving on to the next steps.\n\n1867\n01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,080\nAnd that's what we want.\n\n1868\n01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:32,300\nWe want to have a very efficient well\nthought out process and bang, bang, bang,\n\n1869\n01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,605\nbang, right on down the line.\n\n1870\n01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:38,476\n>> Like you talked about I think in our\nprevious episode, having that procedure,\n\n1871\n01:37:38,476 --> 01:37:41,887\nthat process, that methodology,\nthat repeatable methodology, so\n\n1872\n01:37:41,887 --> 01:37:45,090\nyou're not just willie nilly,\nand shot in the dark kinda thing.\n\n1873\n01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:48,028\n>> Always think about these things,\nwhere you wanna take things.\n\n1874\n01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:48,869\nThe goals and expectations.\n\n1875\n01:37:48,869 --> 01:37:49,786\nThat's what we have.\n\n1876\n01:37:49,786 --> 01:37:50,587\n>> Right.\n\n1877\n01:37:50,587 --> 01:37:54,412\nSo let's see we got another one\nhere in our notes, Shodan HQ?\n\n1878\n01:37:54,412 --> 01:37:59,573\n>> Yeah that's another interesting one and\nI'll point it out to you guys.\n\n1879\n01:37:59,573 --> 01:38:01,870\nThis is the Showdan HQ.\n\n1880\n01:38:01,870 --> 01:38:05,960\nYou can bring up this one.\n\n1881\n01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:11,440\nThis one, the best way to do it is just\nto log in and get an account for it.\n\n1882\n01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,290\nWhen you go there and\ndo it you can actually search on this and\n\n1883\n01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:16,830\nit brings up hardware and stuff like that.\n\n1884\n01:38:16,830 --> 01:38:19,000\nIt's actually a pretty neat thing.\n\n1885\n01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:23,160\nIn fact this one did get some press\nwritten about it for a while because\n\n1886\n01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:28,200\npeople were freaking out because of\njust how much information was there.\n\n1887\n01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:33,168\nSo it's something to kind of think about.\n\n1888\n01:38:33,168 --> 01:38:37,338\n>> Yeah, and I think James mentioned\nin the chat room earlier, somebody did,\n\n1889\n01:38:37,338 --> 01:38:40,022\ntalking about finding\nwebcams was another one.\n\n1890\n01:38:40,022 --> 01:38:43,496\nI don't know how much that fits into here,\nbut it is amazing what you can find.\n\n1891\n01:38:43,496 --> 01:38:46,869\nI see on there, they've got webcams,\nrouters, power plans, iPhones,\n\n1892\n01:38:46,869 --> 01:38:47,626\nwind turbines.\n\n1893\n01:38:47,626 --> 01:38:49,670\nThe things we can look for.\n\n1894\n01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:54,464\n>> There's that thing that they're saying\nnowadays of the Internet of Things.\n\n1895\n01:38:54,464 --> 01:38:58,755\nThat's a term going around,\nit's not my favorite term, but whatever.\n\n1896\n01:38:58,755 --> 01:39:02,553\nThere's this thing called the Internet\nof Things where there's just all\n\n1897\n01:39:02,553 --> 01:39:04,573\nsorts of stuff attached to the Internet.\n\n1898\n01:39:04,573 --> 01:39:07,757\nAnd that's what this kind of\ntechnology kind of leverage is,\n\n1899\n01:39:07,757 --> 01:39:10,758\nis that there's always things\nattached to the Internet,\n\n1900\n01:39:10,758 --> 01:39:13,975\nhas an IP address attached to\nit in some way, shape, or form.\n\n1901\n01:39:13,975 --> 01:39:17,960\nOnce it's attached to the Internet,\nit's a potential target for whatever.\n\n1902\n01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,456\nAnd it's just stunning,\n\n1903\n01:39:19,456 --> 01:39:24,291\nthe amount of things that are attached to\nthe Internet in some way, shape, or form.\n\n1904\n01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,289\nSome stuff that shouldn't\neven be attached,\n\n1905\n01:39:26,289 --> 01:39:29,423\nother things that are kind of like yeah,\nokay, if you hack it, so what.\n\n1906\n01:39:29,423 --> 01:39:34,323\nI think of this one,\nbeing a hockey fan, I think of those,\n\n1907\n01:39:34,323 --> 01:39:39,324\nBudweiser sells these things up\nin Canada that are red light\n\n1908\n01:39:39,324 --> 01:39:43,947\nskull lights that you can put\nin your house some place.\n\n1909\n01:39:43,947 --> 01:39:44,765\nAnd they're Internet enabled.\n\n1910\n01:39:44,765 --> 01:39:47,830\nAnd whenever your favorite team\nscores it goes off and does that.\n\n1911\n01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:50,120\nIt's kind of neat.\n\n1912\n01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:53,610\nBut if someone hacks it, okay, fine.\n\n1913\n01:39:53,610 --> 01:39:55,230\nYou know?\n\n1914\n01:39:55,230 --> 01:39:55,746\nThe Penguins need a better season.\n\n1915\n01:39:55,746 --> 01:39:57,760\nDon't think I didn't see that either.\n\n1916\n01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,933\n>> [LAUGH] [APPLAUSE] Nice, nice catch.\n\n1917\n01:40:01,933 --> 01:40:04,855\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But yeah, worst case they hack your\n\n1918\n01:40:04,855 --> 01:40:07,622\ngoal light, and so\nthey make the light go off in your house.\n\n1919\n01:40:07,622 --> 01:40:10,455\nAnd so you're not that worried\nabout that particular scenario.\n\n1920\n01:40:10,455 --> 01:40:11,151\n>> Exactly.\n\n1921\n01:40:11,151 --> 01:40:13,751\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's give it a sec and\n\n1922\n01:40:13,751 --> 01:40:15,418\nwe'll see if the Pittsburgh\nguy comes back up.\n\n1923\n01:40:15,418 --> 01:40:21,826\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh shoot.\n\n1924\n01:40:21,826 --> 01:40:26,157\nAll right, so\nhave we exhausted Google hacking?\n\n1925\n01:40:26,157 --> 01:40:30,647\nWe know there's a lot more that you can\ndo with it, but we've given a pretty good\n\n1926\n01:40:30,647 --> 01:40:34,215\nidea of what we can do with it,\nand where to get started with it?\n\n1927\n01:40:34,215 --> 01:40:39,828\n>> We've talked about this topic quite\na bit but I think there's something that\n\n1928\n01:40:39,828 --> 01:40:45,546\nwe really need to kind of fit in to this,\nis what I call words of caution on this.\n\n1929\n01:40:45,546 --> 01:40:50,435\nYou don't just have carte blanche to\ndo whatever you want when you do Google\n\n1930\n01:40:50,435 --> 01:40:51,204\nhacking.\n\n1931\n01:40:51,204 --> 01:40:55,140\nI clearly used Google to do this.\n\n1932\n01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:57,080\nI went through and went right into it.\n\n1933\n01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:01,167\nThe thing is, is that if you go\ndirectly into Google to do this stuff,\n\n1934\n01:41:01,167 --> 01:41:06,171\nGoogle does have built-in algorithms in it\nthat if they see these searches going on,\n\n1935\n01:41:06,171 --> 01:41:09,004\nthey will start to throttle\nthem at some point.\n\n1936\n01:41:09,004 --> 01:41:13,217\nSo you need to be aware of that if\nyou're going to use these technologies.\n\n1937\n01:41:13,217 --> 01:41:19,028\nOne that I use is this\nwebsite called startpage.com.\n\n1938\n01:41:19,028 --> 01:41:23,910\nIt's not the only one of its type.\n\n1939\n01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:28,480\nWhat this one does is this one acts\nas essentially a front end to Google.\n\n1940\n01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:31,640\nSo what happens is you put stuff in here,\nand\n\n1941\n01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:36,440\nit pipes it through this website\nanonymously to Google, so it means they\n\n1942\n01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:41,710\ncan't track a lot of queries coming from a\nspecific IP address or a specific system.\n\n1943\n01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:45,760\nTherefore they are a lot less\nlikely to throttle your query.\n\n1944\n01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,040\nSo if you are doing a lot of it, which in\npen testing you are going to be doing more\n\n1945\n01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:54,370\nthan the average Joe is doing this,\nthis becomes an invaluable resource.\n\n1946\n01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:58,350\nIf you don't do this, yeah,\nexpect if you run a bunch of queries\n\n1947\n01:41:58,350 --> 01:42:00,900\nsequentially in a very\nshort period of time.\n\n1948\n01:42:00,900 --> 01:42:03,150\nExpect that they're going to\nstart slowing you down or\n\n1949\n01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:05,780\njust shutting those queries down or\nthey won't give any results.\n\n1950\n01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:08,350\nThey'll just spit something else back or\nspit an error.\n\n1951\n01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,688\n>> It's kind of like putting\nsomething funky in your tax return.\n\n1952\n01:42:12,688 --> 01:42:16,439\nIt's just a reason to red flag you and\nit draws attention, and\n\n1953\n01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:18,134\nthen what we do from there.\n\n1954\n01:42:18,134 --> 01:42:19,456\n>> What's a tax return?\n\n1955\n01:42:19,456 --> 01:42:22,162\n[LAUGH]\n>> You don't have to worry about\n\n1956\n01:42:22,162 --> 01:42:22,747\nraising a red flag.\n\n1957\n01:42:22,747 --> 01:42:26,250\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n1958\n01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:31,025\njust remember that's something\nthat's going to happen.\n\n1959\n01:42:31,025 --> 01:42:35,967\nIt's not something that you can stop\nif you're using Google directly.\n\n1960\n01:42:35,967 --> 01:42:40,753\nBut it is something that you can get\naround by using pages like this.\n\n1961\n01:42:40,753 --> 01:42:43,631\n>> Anonymizers or proxy type things.\n\n1962\n01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:45,856\n>> Anonymizers or\nproxies are another thing you can use.\n\n1963\n01:42:45,856 --> 01:42:50,247\nI saw a proxy being mentioned\non here is that that would be\n\n1964\n01:42:50,247 --> 01:42:52,404\nanother great way to do it.\n\n1965\n01:42:52,404 --> 01:42:56,365\nYou can use stuff like in Firefox,\nthere's Foxy Proxy.\n\n1966\n01:42:56,365 --> 01:42:59,495\nThere's Tor, I've seen people mention.\n\n1967\n01:42:59,495 --> 01:43:03,398\nI don't think Tor's the best choice for\nthis, but you could technically use it.\n\n1968\n01:43:03,398 --> 01:43:11,090\nI even have, on this system, I have\nsomething called the Epic Privacy Browser,\n\n1969\n01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:15,130\nand that one cleans up a whole\nbunch of tracks after you.\n\n1970\n01:43:15,130 --> 01:43:19,330\nIt's very, very locked down,\nit goes through a proxy as well.\n\n1971\n01:43:19,330 --> 01:43:21,620\nAnd you could choose when it goes\nthrough a proxy and when it doesn't.\n\n1972\n01:43:21,620 --> 01:43:24,920\nIf it goes through a proxy everything\nlooks like it's coming from New Jersey.\n\n1973\n01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:30,400\n>> Yeah, and keep in mind when we're\nlooking at some of those browsers they've\n\n1974\n01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,300\ngot those privacy options.\n\n1975\n01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:34,170\nLike an InPrivate browsing session,\n\n1976\n01:43:34,170 --> 01:43:37,225\nnow that's not the same thing\nwe're talking about here.\n\n1977\n01:43:37,225 --> 01:43:41,652\nBecause that's keeping your computer,\nyour device from recording your history,\n\n1978\n01:43:41,652 --> 01:43:44,670\nputting cookies on your machine,\nand things like that.\n\n1979\n01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:47,356\nIt has nothing to do with hiding\nyou from the Internet and\n\n1980\n01:43:47,356 --> 01:43:50,800\npeople seeing what IP address your\ncoming from, and things like that.\n\n1981\n01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,450\n>> Yeah, I'm glad you bring that up,\n\n1982\n01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:55,710\nbecause that's a big mistake there\npeople make with modes like that.\n\n1983\n01:43:55,710 --> 01:44:00,268\nThat won't help you if you run\nprivacy mode it's not gonna stop\n\n1984\n01:44:00,268 --> 01:44:02,420\nGoogle from throttling you.\n\n1985\n01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:03,540\n>> Right.\n\n1986\n01:44:03,540 --> 01:44:04,720\n>> Cuz that's only for that system.\n\n1987\n01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:08,400\nIt's not gonna stop the stuff coming\nout of and going back to your system.\n\n1988\n01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,440\nSo that's something\ndefinitely to remember.\n\n1989\n01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,680\nWhat you have to use is\nyou have to use a proxy.\n\n1990\n01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:18,960\nYou have to in some way mask where that\ntraffic's originating to keep it from\n\n1991\n01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:19,930\nbeing throttled.\n\n1992\n01:44:19,930 --> 01:44:23,000\nThat's why startpage.com\nwould be a good one.\n\n1993\n01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:26,530\nThat's why this Epic Privacy\nbrowser would be a good one.\n\n1994\n01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:28,330\nThere's a number of things out there and\n\n1995\n01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:32,120\nplugins as well that can\nkeep your stuff anonymous.\n\n1996\n01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:34,240\nBut as we'll talk about\nlater on the plugins for\n\n1997\n01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:37,997\nthe browsers,\nthose plugins themselves can phone home.\n\n1998\n01:44:37,997 --> 01:44:40,457\nAnd they may, even though\nyou're private in your browser,\n\n1999\n01:44:40,457 --> 01:44:43,489\nthe plugins that go into it cound phone\nhome and reveal who you are anyway.\n\n2000\n01:44:43,489 --> 01:44:46,490\nSo you need to be thinking\nabout these things.\n\n2001\n01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:48,105\nBut we'll get to that.\n\n2002\n01:44:48,105 --> 01:44:50,745\nWe're working towards that.\n\n2003\n01:44:50,745 --> 01:44:51,495\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n2004\n01:44:51,495 --> 01:44:56,345\nAll right, so anything else we\nwanna add in to our Google hacking?\n\n2005\n01:44:56,345 --> 01:44:57,115\n>> I think we're good.\n\n2006\n01:44:57,115 --> 01:44:58,305\nI think we're pretty good.\n\n2007\n01:44:58,305 --> 01:45:01,905\nWe've covered it, and\nnow it's up to you guys to try it out and\n\n2008\n01:45:01,905 --> 01:45:04,505\nstart experimenting and\nuse the Google hacking database.\n\n2009\n01:45:04,505 --> 01:45:05,940\nGet familiar with it.\n\n2010\n01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:09,980\nI mean, there's a lot of power for you to\nunlock, just waiting for you to get in and\n\n2011\n01:45:09,980 --> 01:45:13,720\nexplore it and play around and try\ndifferent things and see what you can get.\n\n2012\n01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:16,100\nI strongly, strongly encourage that.\n\n2013\n01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,160\nIt will be your best friend.\n\n2014\n01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,170\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n2015\n01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:21,840\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen I'll\ntell you what, that's gonna do it for\n\n2016\n01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:22,590\nthis episode.\n\n2017\n01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,750\nRemember, we covered a lot of\ninformation in this episode.\n\n2018\n01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:28,680\nWe've been talking about footprinting or\nreconnaissance.\n\n2019\n01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:33,500\nWe started off with the general idea\nof what footprinting was, the legality\n\n2020\n01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:38,490\nissues that we might deal with and what we\ncan expect to get out of footprinting and\n\n2021\n01:45:38,490 --> 01:45:41,070\nlooking at our expectations and our goals.\n\n2022\n01:45:41,070 --> 01:45:44,014\nWe took a look at the open\nsource intelligence gathering,\n\n2023\n01:45:44,014 --> 01:45:47,091\nall the different ways I can go out and\nget this information.\n\n2024\n01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:50,563\nNot by hacking in anybody, but\nsomething's freely available,\n\n2025\n01:45:50,563 --> 01:45:53,919\nthat's available to the public,\njust knowing where to look.\n\n2026\n01:45:53,919 --> 01:45:55,526\nWe talked about competitive intelligence.\n\n2027\n01:45:55,526 --> 01:45:59,294\nAnd then that last part there,\nwe dived into Google hacking.\n\n2028\n01:45:59,294 --> 01:46:04,590\nAnd I think it opened a lot of eyes to how\nwe can take one of these search engines.\n\n2029\n01:46:04,590 --> 01:46:08,370\nAnd by using the right\noperators on our searches,\n\n2030\n01:46:08,370 --> 01:46:10,360\nfind some really interesting information.\n\n2031\n01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:13,350\nSo maybe opened your eyes in\na couple of respects, like wow,\n\n2032\n01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:15,630\nI can't believe all that stuff's\nout there and so easy to find.\n\n2033\n01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:18,480\nAnd two,\nwhat do I need to do to make sure that I'm\n\n2034\n01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:21,360\nnot one of these guys that's showing up in\nthe results of one of these Google hacks?\n\n2035\n01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,360\nSo I hope you guys\nenjoyed today's episode.\n\n2036\n01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:27,010\nRemember if you've got\nquestions during the show,\n\n2037\n01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:29,790\nfeel free to jump in that chat room and\ntype those questions in.\n\n2038\n01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:32,790\nWe're here, we'll respond to\nthose questions as they pop up.\n\n2039\n01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:34,970\nIf you're watching this

everybody to\nanother episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:41,851\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:42,680\nHow's it going Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,210\n>> Well, I'm pretty good,\nhow about yourself?\n\n7\n00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,160\n>> It's another day in\nparadise here at ITProTV land\n\n8\n00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,400\nbecause we are continuing\non with our CEH episodes.\n\n9\n00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,080\nAnd I'm with the author of\nthe book the CEH Study Guide for\n\n10\n00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,770\nthe CEH Exam Version 5.\n\n11\n00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,880\n>> I'm going to start a product placement.\n\n12\n00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,158\n>> There we go, get that thing up there.\n\n13\n00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:01,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what I'm talking about.\n\n14\n00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,290\nSo if you want to follow along\nmake sure you go out and\n\n15\n00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,340\npick yourself up a copy of that book.\n\n16\n00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,660\nWe are of course giving away some of\nthose books, as well as some of you know.\n\n17\n00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,580\nSo anyway, so we are continuing on.\n\n18\n00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,980\nThis is going to be Footprinting part two,\nthere's a lot to footprinting, right?\n\n19\n00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,690\nIt's the first phase in our hacking\nlife cycle or hacking process.\n\n20\n00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,280\nIt's one of the phases that we\nspend a good majority of time in\n\n21\n00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,860\nbecause this is where gathering up\nall the information about our target.\n\n22\n00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,990\nAnd the more information\nwe have the more efficient,\n\n23\n00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,450\nthe more effective\nthe attack process can be.\n\n24\n00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,850\nSo let's continue on and I think we'll\nstart off with talking about, you know,\n\n25\n00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,740\nthe technical data that we want\nto try to gather that's gonna\n\n26\n00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,690\nfacilitate the rest of\nour hacking process.\n\n27\n00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,860\n>> Exactly, it's a good point to actually\ntalk about the technical data that we\n\n28\n00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,810\ncan gather.\n\n29\n00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,860\nAnd there's a wealth of technical data\n\n30\n00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,790\nthat can be gathered out there just by\ndoing your research and poking around.\n\n31\n00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,820\nSo, what we're gonna do is talk about\nthe different types we have and\n\n32\n00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,315\nwhat that means to you.\n\n33\n00:02:01,315 --> 00:02:03,790\nSo, what can you do with it?\n\n34\n00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,720\nWell, you can do a lot when\nyou get the technical data,\n\n35\n00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,620\nyou can start really fine-tuning things.\n\n36\n00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,870\nWhat we're trying to do is trying to get\ninformation that tells us about how things\n\n37\n00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,510\nare structured.\n\n38\n00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,270\nThings that may allow us to let's say,\n\n39\n00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,320\nmap out their network, tell what types of\ntechnology they're running and give us\n\n40\n00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,890\nan idea of what that environment looks\nlike to allow us to penetrate in further.\n\n41\n00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,800\nIt's just like saying what you're trying\nto do is you wanna drive someplace but\n\n42\n00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,020\nyou need a map to get there.\n\n43\n00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,685\nYou may eventually, I could get to\nCalifornia by saying just drive west.\n\n44\n00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,212\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But that's not gonna help.\n\n45\n00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:39,210\n>> [COUGH] [LAUGH]\n>> I will find California eventually but\n\n46\n00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,920\nI need more accurate directions than that.\n\n47\n00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,623\n>> With a nice map we can be a little more\nefficient with our drive to California.\n\n48\n00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:46,310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n49\n00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,020\ninstead of just wandering type thing,\nI need to go right in.\n\n50\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,160\n>> Right into a mountain,\nlet's turn this way.\n\n51\n00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And just go around, just keep going.\n\n52\n00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,670\nSo that's what we're trying to do,\nwe're trying to build a technical data,\n\n53\n00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,450\ndatabase that we can really kinda get\na a better idea of how best to proceed.\n\n54\n00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,090\n>> And there's a lot of tools\nthat facilitate this, right?\n\n55\n00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,840\nThat we can get access to,\nthat are freely available and\n\n56\n00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,720\nwe're still talking about for the most\npart passive type information gathering.\n\n57\n00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,160\n>> Yes, you are talking about\npassive information gathering.\n\n58\n00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,730\nInteresting thing you're\ngonna see here and\n\n59\n00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,000\nI really kinda want to draw your attention\nto it, cuz it shows the type of thinking\n\n60\n00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,980\nthat you really need to have as a lot of\nthe tools that you'll see in play here.\n\n61\n00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,232\nMap out networks, start finding things.\n\n62\n00:03:31,232 --> 00:03:34,320\nThere are tools that you\nprobably already know.\n\n63\n00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,540\nWe're doing this, we're purposing them for\nthe process that we have here.\n\n64\n00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,680\nWe're just trying to re-purpose stuff and\n\n65\n00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,300\ngather information with the intent\nof using it to penetrate further.\n\n66\n00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,410\nStuff like Ping which I'm not gonna\nworry about demoing that here\n\n67\n00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,470\nit will come in later, trust me.\n\n68\n00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,376\nBut things like Ping, things like\nTraceroute, things like NSlookup,\n\n69\n00:03:57,376 --> 00:04:02,220\nthere are things that a lot of us already\nknow from doing our own troubleshooting.\n\n70\n00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,325\nWe're just using it to kind of maybe\nlike casting a different lights.\n\n71\n00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:06,760\nSee, okay, that's useful stuff.\n\n72\n00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,850\nSo that's the cool thing,\n\n73\n00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,080\nyou do know a lot of these things we're\njust trying to shape your thinking.\n\n74\n00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,430\n>> Yeah, a lot of this stuff\nstart out as admin tools.\n\n75\n00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,970\nTools that I need as an administrator\nto take care of my network,\n\n76\n00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,480\nmonitor my network and things like that\nand once the bad guys get a hold of it or\n\n77\n00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,950\nthey decide to try to do\nsomething else with it,\n\n78\n00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,380\nthat's when it becomes a hacking tool and\nPing is a great example.\n\n79\n00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,370\nA lot of people don't realize\nthat Ping has a payload, right?\n\n80\n00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,710\nIt can carry 53 bytes or something so\nwe can use that as a delivery method.\n\n81\n00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,980\nAnd, who would of thought of, and\n\n82\n00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,320\nwe all know Ping is a way\nto test our connectivity.\n\n83\n00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,350\nNever thought of it as a way to\ndeliver a payload into a system.\n\n84\n00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,800\n>> Yeah, you're exactly right.\n\n85\n00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,370\nI mean,\n\n86\n00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,940\nwhat you're talking about, with that one\nis something called a covert channel.\n\n87\n00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,610\nAnd so in that case,\nwe are using it not as a diagnostic but\n\n88\n00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,885\nwe are using it as a payload\ndelivery mechanism.\n\n89\n00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:58,000\nIt's totally allowed, it's completely\nallowed by Spec that's not someone's gonna\n\n90\n00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,560\ntry a fast one over on you that's\nactually allowed to be done.\n\n91\n00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,602\nSo, and we're gonna visit that,\n\n92\n00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:07,536\nit's actually something that\nwe'll see in this course.\n\n93\n00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:08,609\nNo more spoilers.\n\n94\n00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,860\n>> I'm sorry, that was a cliffhanger\nto make sure you guys come back.\n\n95\n00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,082\nWait, I can use ping as\na payload delivery method, what?\n\n96\n00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:20,920\n>> It's like Batman, next week,\nnext week's episode.\n\n97\n00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,414\nSo that, yeah,\nwe'll be actually seeing that but\n\n98\n00:05:24,414 --> 00:05:29,730\nthe intention is though there still is\na lot of tools here that you've seen.\n\n99\n00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,830\nI just want to encourage you to look\nat all the tools that you have and\n\n100\n00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,360\nyou're using already, say what type\nof information is this giving me and\n\n101\n00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,070\nwhat could I do use,\ndo with that information.\n\n102\n00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,820\n>> Right.\n\n103\n00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,580\n>> So, like I said, lots of stuff\nyou already know which is great.\n\n104\n00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,890\n>> Lots for you to learn.\n\n105\n00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,200\nMore for your change thought process.\n\n106\n00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,400\nThat's about what we're looking at.\n\n107\n00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,820\n>> Exactly, all right, so\nwhere do you want to start?\n\n108\n00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,180\nWhat's one of your tools\nwe can use to do some\n\n109\n00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,440\ninformation gathering of\nthe technical variety?\n\n110\n00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,810\n>> Well, one of our tools that\nwe can use is one called WHOis.\n\n111\n00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,060\nWHOis is a tool that probably just\n\n112\n00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,560\nabout everyone out here is familiar\nwith it in some way, shape or form.\n\n113\n00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,680\nWHOis can return information\nabout a domain to us.\n\n114\n00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,580\nAnd we can type in really any domain and\nget information back.\n\n115\n00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,950\nSo, this is one of\nthe many WHOis websites.\n\n116\n00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,590\nThere are other websites that offer this\ntype of functionality and you also have\n\n117\n00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,710\none WHOis client built into UNIX and\nLINUX that's where it actually came from.\n\n118\n00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:36,920\nJust for the record for\nWindows, Windows does\n\n119\n00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,250\nnot have a WHOis client built into it,\nbut you actually can download one.\n\n120\n00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,380\nThey do,\nMicrosoft does have one available.\n\n121\n00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,050\nWhy they didn't actually\nstick it in the product?\n\n122\n00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,730\nI don't know,\nI guess it made too much sense therefore,\n\n123\n00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,685\nit's not the Microsoft policy to\ninclude it in that product, all right.\n\n124\n00:06:52,685 --> 00:06:54,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not getting paid, people.\n\n125\n00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,854\nI'm not doing paid endorsements.\n\n126\n00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:57,285\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n127\n00:06:57,285 --> 00:07:01,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in any case, I don't know why,\n\n128\n00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,800\nthere's usually some reason behind that,\nI just don't know what it is.\n\n129\n00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,880\n>> So they probably had a very logical\nreason, I just don't know what that is.\n\n130\n00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,105\nBut in any case, we'll take\na look at the results for WHOis.\n\n131\n00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:17,120\nNow, I just chose one website.\n\n132\n00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,738\nIf I type in, let's just go ahead and\n\n133\n00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:23,629\ntype in Microsoft.com and\nsee what we get off of this.\n\n134\n00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,100\nSo it should go through it's\nsearch through the database.\n\n135\n00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,410\nOkay, it's already registered but,hey,\nWHOis?\n\n136\n00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,520\nOne of the things it is used for a lot\nnowadays, is to see who owns a domain.\n\n137\n00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,810\nThat's what a lot of people run into at.\n\n138\n00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:41,530\n>> Yeah, you'll see like on Google if\nyou go to any of your registrars or\n\n139\n00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,150\nyour resellers they'll have the WHOis\nlookup field so you can type in a name and\n\n140\n00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,220\nsee if it's already in used, right.\n\n141\n00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,410\nBecause it has to be registered,\nit has to be unique.\n\n142\n00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,010\nAnd it might pop-up that it's available,\nright.\n\n143\n00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,294\nThat this person has registered that, but\nthey're willing to sell it for a fee or\n\n144\n00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:54,226\nsomething like that.\n\n145\n00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:57,727\nSo probably a lot of us have\nexperience about WHOis.\n\n146\n00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,118\nYeah and so, what we're doing now,\n\n147\n00:08:00,118 --> 00:08:03,930\nis we are just looking a little\nmore in-depth at that.\n\n148\n00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:08,000\nNow the thing is, and I think this\nis a good thing to take note of,\n\n149\n00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,180\nis if you look at the who is information\nthat I have on the screen here,\n\n150\n00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,910\nit's not very detailed is it?\n\n151\n00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,030\n>> No.\nCan you control scroll on that?\n\n152\n00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,679\n>> Yeah can we do a full screen on\nthat and get us a closer look at that?\n\n153\n00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,580\nYeah, you can see that\nit's got some information.\n\n154\n00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,890\nThe information here is\nactually pretty decent.\n\n155\n00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,350\nIt's not a full who-is query.\n\n156\n00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,180\nIf you look at it, well,\nwhat does it have?\n\n157\n00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,810\nIt has the name server information.\n\n158\n00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,970\nThat is useful.\n\n159\n00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,550\nThat is definitely useful.\n\n160\n00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,830\nSo those are the things\nyou'd wanna write down.\n\n161\n00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:47,000\nBut, we can actually use some\nof the other whois sites.\n\n162\n00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,780\nIn fact, I'll just use one from\nGoDaddy.com, they have one that\n\n163\n00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,670\nyou're probably used to seeing.\n\n164\n00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,580\nI can type in, Microsoft up here,\n\n165\n00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,570\nand it's gonna go through and\nlook to see if that domain's available.\n\n166\n00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,890\nWe expect to see the same results.\n\n167\n00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:13,790\nSo it's already taken, it should actually\nhave something relating to it in here.\n\n168\n00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,210\nIf I click on this, this will probably\ntake me to, well actually this one isn't,\n\n169\n00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,000\nit doesn't look like this one's\nallowing me to go directly to that.\n\n170\n00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,600\n>> Looks like they changed\nthat up a little bit.\n\n171\n00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,900\nBecause you used to be able to link\nright there into that who is data base.\n\n172\n00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,462\n>> Yeah and that's the thing,\n\n173\n00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:36,381\nlet's try doing that here and\nsee what results we get.\n\n174\n00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,238\nSaid we're doing it,\nwe're doing it live people.\n\n175\n00:09:43,238 --> 00:09:43,753\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n176\n00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:49,260\n>> So [LAUGH] but\nthere's plenty of things out there.\n\n177\n00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,450\nLet's, let's see if we type in, who is\nfor, and look to see what else Google has.\n\n178\n00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,560\nThere's domain tools.\n\n179\n00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,080\nThey're usually pretty good with this.\n\n180\n00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is actually one of the one's that\n\n181\n00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:03,015\nthey look on for the exam.\n\n182\n00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:08,150\nIf I type, it's hard to believe I\nactually wrote books when I can't type,\n\n183\n00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,065\nMicrosoft or anything.\n\n184\n00:10:10,065 --> 00:10:12,570\n[LAUGH] That's what we have editors for,\nright?\n\n185\n00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,440\n>> Yeah.\n>> We pay people to do that.\n\n186\n00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,605\n>> We're hiring a copy editor, all right?\n\n187\n00:10:16,605 --> 00:10:18,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oriana's an idiot and he can't type,\n\n188\n00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,490\nbecause he's got fat fingers or whatever.\n\n189\n00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:24,540\nSo this is actually a pretty good one.\n\n190\n00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,647\nWhen you look at the domain,\nthe domaintools.com,\n\n191\n00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:30,130\nit's one of many that do this.\n\n192\n00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,980\nYou can see it what it's doing here.\n\n193\n00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,430\nIt's giving you email contact information.\n\n194\n00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:37,690\nWho the registrar is on it.\n\n195\n00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,815\nThere's are name servers.\n\n196\n00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:41,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So we see that.\n\n197\n00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,282\nBut it's also giving us other stuff.\n\n198\n00:10:43,282 --> 00:10:48,080\nYou know, IP information,\nwe can see in there, it's got 203 changes.\n\n199\n00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,620\nOkay, fine that's\nsomething to kind of note.\n\n200\n00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,291\nSo good information.\n\n201\n00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,330\nThen you go down here.\n\n202\n00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,170\nThis is the actual who is information.\n\n203\n00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,320\nThat the raw information,\nthat that comes out.\n\n204\n00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is the raw information that comes\n\n205\n00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,400\nout when you do a who is query.\n\n206\n00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,050\nNotice how it's very different than\nwhat you saw a few moments ago.\n\n207\n00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,828\n>> Yes.\n>> With who is dot net.\n\n208\n00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:16,890\nWho is .net gave you a very very\nshort list, a very specific stuff.\n\n209\n00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,130\nAnd here we look at this, and\nwe can see that there is clearly,\n\n210\n00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,240\nwithout reading through it,\nclearly there's a lot more information.\n\n211\n00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,050\nNow if you take a close\nlook at this information,\n\n212\n00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,210\nif we were to zoom in here and\nlook at this information.\n\n213\n00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,040\nYou can see that this information,\na lot of it just kind of tells us,\n\n214\n00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,060\nhey Microsoft up in Redmond,\nokay fine we know that.\n\n215\n00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,880\nBut something I kinda want to point out,\n\n216\n00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,778\nyou can see phone numbers in here,\nyou know, other stuff.\n\n217\n00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,590\nSometimes you will, for\nsome companies you will see an actual name\n\n218\n00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,720\nas a domain administrator and\nthe technical contact.\n\n219\n00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,950\nYou will see that stuff in there.\n\n220\n00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,150\nWe're not seeing that here,\n\n221\n00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,980\nwe're seeing a general thing,\nthat's actually pretty good.\n\n222\n00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,840\nTo put something in there saying this is\nthe MSN Host Master, for example, that,\n\n223\n00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,570\nor, domain administrator's another one.\n\n224\n00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,832\n>> Nice, generic name.\n>> That's actually pretty good, yeah,\n\n225\n00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:08,640\nit's generic.\n\n226\n00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,892\nNow from the administrative side that has\n\n227\n00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:19,150\nto be there, but knows who to contact.\n\n228\n00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,490\nFrom security side, I don't want to put\na specific name in there because you\n\n229\n00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,630\ncould do social engineering, right?\n\n230\n00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,955\n>> Absolutely.\n>> You got someones name.\n\n231\n00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:28,460\n>> Absolutely.\n\n232\n00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,820\n>> And I think a lot of companies have\ngotten a lot better at this lately,\n\n233\n00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,230\nin the past, years ago, this information,\npeople would put actually usernames.\n\n234\n00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,540\nWhoever their current IT admin was,\nhis phone number and things like that.\n\n235\n00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,410\nPeople started realizing that, wow, this\ninformation could be used because this\n\n236\n00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,080\nis publicly available, anybody can get it.\n\n237\n00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,050\nSo people are getting a little bit\nsmarter about when they go and\n\n238\n00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,860\nregister this stuff, they're putting\nin information because like you said,\n\n239\n00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,890\nthey have to have this to register, but\n\n240\n00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,430\nit doesn't have to be a specific\npersons name and things like that.\n\n241\n00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:59,652\nSo they're conscious about what\ninformation they're exposing,\n\n242\n00:12:59,652 --> 00:13:02,250\nto try to keep their\ndomain a little safer.\n\n243\n00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,810\n>> Yeah, and,\nlet me paint a scenario here for you.\n\n244\n00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,400\nYou just opened up the door for this one.\n\n245\n00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,950\nIs companies in the past didn't really\nthink about the information they\n\n246\n00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,100\nwere putting out there, and so, they\njust said oh, they wanted an admin name.\n\n247\n00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,140\nGive me an admin name.\n\n248\n00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,330\nAnd they, they'd write one in.\n\n249\n00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,370\nWhat happened since then?\n\n250\n00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,620\nWhat if they registered their domain,\nlet's say,\n\n251\n00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,355\nlike a lot people did in the late 90's.\n\n252\n00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:25,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n253\n00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,200\n>> They register that domain,\n\n254\n00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,510\nthey put that name in there,\nwhat have they done since then?\n\n255\n00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> Someone's written a check and\n\n256\n00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,050\nsent it in.\n\n257\n00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,290\nThey haven't changed any of that.\n\n258\n00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,980\n>> Updated any of that, correct.\n\n259\n00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,560\n>> Okay.\nSo\n\n260\n00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,965\nwe know that's probably\nthe norm in a lot of cases.\n\n261\n00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:41,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you happen to find that and\n\n262\n00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,320\nsee when the records were\noriginally create, and\n\n263\n00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,910\nyou still see that stuff in there,\nyou might\n\n264\n00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,900\nvery well be able to call that company and\nsay I am looking for so and so.\n\n265\n00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,860\nAnd if they say, if that person is not\nthere anymore, which they may not.\n\n266\n00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,420\nYou can say, okay, well, I'm looking for\nthis person, because I've got to talk to\n\n267\n00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,130\nthem about your hosting account or\nyour domain account, something like that.\n\n268\n00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,576\nAnd they may point you towards the right\nperson, now you have that person's name.\n\n269\n00:14:08,576 --> 00:14:09,090\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n270\n00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,040\n>> And now you can actually talk to them,\noh, well, you know that person.\n\n271\n00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,810\nOkay, well, you've got their name,\nI'm handling this, what do you need, well,\n\n272\n00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,455\nI need this, this, and this, you've\njust dropped their defenses cuz some\n\n273\n00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:22,075\nother company has referred you to them and\nyou got a name.\n\n274\n00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:22,780\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n275\n00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,230\n>> So there's a really good example\nof stuff you could find there.\n\n276\n00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,435\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n277\n00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:32,470\n>> Now, let me kind of fill in some\nof this a bit more here too, is,\n\n278\n00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,910\nnowadays it is not uncommon,\nwith the information you see\n\n279\n00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,200\nhere in this who is record, it's not\nuncommon to see it where this is proxy.\n\n280\n00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,140\nWhere they will put a generic name\nin there, up and beyond this.\n\n281\n00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,820\n>> Right.\n>> If you look at for example,\n\n282\n00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,790\nmy own domain.\n\n283\n00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:50,390\nIf you go there,\n\n284\n00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,420\nyou'll see that my domain, all the stuff\nsays, has a company in Arizona.\n\n285\n00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,330\n>> Third party that's doing it for you or\nthat, so the record, according to the who\n\n286\n00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,620\nis database, it looks like as registered\nto this third party, to this proxy.\n\n287\n00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,810\n>> Yeah, there's no specific names put\nin there, your contact in the company,\n\n288\n00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,125\nthat's the company's name is on\nseveral other domains as well.\n\n289\n00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:10,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n290\n00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:15,550\nwhat happens is you email the contact\non there, it goes to that company, and\n\n291\n00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,015\nthat company sends it on to me.\n\n292\n00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,768\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You never see that it's actually me.\n\n293\n00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:20,270\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n294\n00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,110\n>> Behind that.\n\n295\n00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:27,705\nAnd so it makes Makes things just a lot\nsafer, than just having this out there.\n\n296\n00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:29,507\n>> All right.\nAll right,\n\n297\n00:15:29,507 --> 00:15:32,255\nso a lot of information we've\ngathered from the who is,\n\n298\n00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:37,270\nfrom a simple DNS registrations,\nor who their DNS Servers are,\n\n299\n00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,140\nmaybe who their admins are and\ndepending on how much they've left out,\n\n300\n00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,350\na lot of good information that I\ncan then use, in our next phase.\n\n301\n00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,080\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n302\n00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,910\n>> All right.\n\n303\n00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,500\nSo we've got that.\n\n304\n00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,440\nSo what else, so we got DNS\ninformation like we saw in that,\n\n305\n00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,870\nthe results of that whois\nthat we got their DNS info.\n\n306\n00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:56,086\nSo I could see they had, it looked like\nthey had four different servers that that\n\n307\n00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:58,154\nthat they're using as\ntheir primary DNS servers.\n\n308\n00:15:58,154 --> 00:15:59,395\nWhat do I do with that?\n\n309\n00:15:59,395 --> 00:16:02,621\nWell, it, I before,\nbefore we really talk bout the DNS stuff.\n\n310\n00:16:02,621 --> 00:16:03,121\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n311\n00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:05,112\n>> We kind of need to understand what DNS\n\n312\n00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:07,045\nis.\n>> Okay. [CROSSTALK] >> Now I know, a,\n\n313\n00:16:07,045 --> 00:16:11,377\na lot of you probably have\nsome knowledge of DNS and\n\n314\n00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,694\nthat's great.\nLet's just do a quick\n\n315\n00:16:13,694 --> 00:16:14,349\nreview.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n316\n00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:14,849\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n317\n00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:16,184\n>> To make sure everyone's on the same\n\n318\n00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,900\npage.\nWhat, what DNS is,\n\n319\n00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,560\nis a domain name service that\nresolves names to IP addresses or\n\n320\n00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,880\nIP addresses to names.\nYou know, it's a,\n\n321\n00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,330\nit's a commonly support service.\nIt's been around now for\n\n322\n00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,040\nabout 30 years now or something like that.\n>> Um-hm.\n\n323\n00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,440\nSo it's just a, just a, a database that\n\n324\n00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,440\ncontains those mappings inside of it.\nEach one of the records in a database,\n\n325\n00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,210\nis gonna, is gonna be called a DNS record.\n>> Mmhmm.\n\n326\n00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,040\n>> And those DNS records come in different\n\n327\n00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,830\ntypes.\nThere's things like MX and\n\n328\n00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,950\nNS which we saw the NS ones for\nname servers.\n\n329\n00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,870\nThere's a, there's MX for mail servers.\n\n330\n00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,880\nThere's SOAs for star of authority,\ntells us you know, you know, who's the.\n\n331\n00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,630\nWhere, where that part of the deal,\nthe zone starts.\n\n332\n00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,610\nYou know, plus there's a,\na bunch of other ones.\n\n333\n00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,360\nAnd then there's A records, that do\nnamed IP for IP4, there is Quadruple A.\n\n334\n00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,770\nDo named IP for IP 6.\n\n335\n00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,150\nThere's PTR Records to do reverse.\n\n336\n00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,170\nSo-\n>> SRV, SRV records for all of the.\n\n337\n00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,700\n>> That's a good one.\n\n338\n00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,360\n>> Services that are running.\n\n339\n00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,910\nYeah, those are always good one's to get,\nbecause, I mean if I'm going to attack\n\n340\n00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,870\ntheir network, I'd love to know which\nones are the domain controllers.\n\n341\n00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,221\n>> Yes.\n>> Which ones are running LDAP.\n\n342\n00:17:17,221 --> 00:17:18,403\n[LAUGH] Things like that.\n\n343\n00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:19,575\nSo.\n>> Yeah, you've, you've,\n\n344\n00:17:19,575 --> 00:17:22,601\nyou've really kind of hit the nail on the\nhead is if you're acquiring records and\n\n345\n00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,190\nyou find\n>> If I get to a DNS server that pukes up,\n\n346\n00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,070\nyou know, a bunch of SRV records for\nthe

close.\n\n349\n00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,820\nAnd yes the right records come back.\n\n350\n00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,210\nThe SRV records are dead give away\nthere's active directories there.\n\n351\n00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,540\nYou know so you, you do need to be, you do\nneed to be thinking that hopefully someone\n\n352\n00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,431\nhas a split DNS or\nsomething set up that they.\n\n353\n00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,895\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Aren't exposing\n\n354\n00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,054\nSRV work to the outside.\n\n355\n00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:50,664\n>> Absolutely.\n\n356\n00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:52,420\n>> If they are, you know\n>> You need to go and\n\n357\n00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,480\nsmack them on the back of the head and go,\nwhat are you thing, what are you thinking?\n\n358\n00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,000\nDon't do that.\n\n359\n00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,970\n>> Go back and watch our, our, our\nMicrosoft episodes where we cover server\n\n360\n00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,800\nadministration, learn how\nto do some split DNS.\n\n361\n00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,960\n>> Yeah, you, you, it was definitely\nsome homework needs to be done very,\n\n362\n00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,650\nvery clearly cuz it's only a matter\nof time before someone finds that.\n\n363\n00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,090\nAnd realistically there's SRVs for\n\n364\n00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,425\nActive Directory structure to be\nexposed to the outside anyway.\n\n365\n00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:13,990\n>> RIght.\n\n366\n00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,435\n>> So but,\ndoesn't mean you won't find them.\n\n367\n00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:18,480\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> Remember that.\n\n368\n00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,700\nDoesn't mean you won't find them.\n\n369\n00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,790\n>> What domain controller in a DMZ?\n\n370\n00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,230\nDoesn't everybody do that?\n\n371\n00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,770\n>> Yeah, why not?\n\n372\n00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,550\nIt's powerful.\n\n373\n00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,850\nWhy don't everyone have access to it?\n\n374\n00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,657\nSo eh, so we have DNS,\n\n375\n00:18:30,657 --> 00:18:34,000\nDNS is hierarchical of course, as the root\n>> And\n\n376\n00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,230\nthen has it's top level domains,\nthe .com, the .net, and then it has the,\n\n377\n00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,060\nand then it has the stuff underneath that,\nwhich are our names like, your Microsoft,\n\n378\n00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,330\nyou know, your what, Auto Desks,\nyou're whatever is there.\n\n379\n00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:48,315\n>> Second level domain so\nwe all have to register.\n\n380\n00:18:48,315 --> 00:18:49,525\n>> Yeah.\nAnd it can go down.\n\n381\n00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:50,385\nJust think of it as a big you know,\n\n382\n00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:53,135\npyramid is the way I\nlike to think about it.\n\n383\n00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:55,865\nAnd so, you've got that\ntype of situation going on.\n\n384\n00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:58,065\nSo that's what DNS looks like and\nthat's what it does,\n\n385\n00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:00,065\nit will help you resolve things.\n\n386\n00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:04,975\nSo, that's important to us if\nwe focus on at this point,\n\n387\n00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:09,560\nwe focus on the records, if we focus\non records that really gives us\n\n388\n00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,750\nan idea of, of what type of\ninformation can be, can be pulled.\n\n389\n00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,620\nYou know, I mentioned all those,\nmentioned all those record types,\n\n390\n00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,010\nyou know you brought in SRV records\n\n391\n00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:20,860\nbeing able to return those at\na DNS can give us clues of things.\n\n392\n00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,950\nVery, very good clues of things.\n\n393\n00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,130\nAnd so, you've got ways of doing that.\n\n394\n00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,040\nRetrieving those records.\n\n395\n00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,066\nYou have things liked a NS look up.\n\n396\n00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,140\n>> Right.\n>> Which is old school.\n\n397\n00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,240\n>> Yeah, but it still works.\n\n398\n00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,500\nThat is a wonderful tool.\n\n399\n00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,162\n>> You, you can't beat the old\nreliable stuff, right.\n\n400\n00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:35,860\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n401\n00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,990\n>> It still works quite well.\n\n402\n00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:42,514\nThen there's another really good one,\ncalled you know, the MX toolbox.\n\n403\n00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,470\n>> Um-hm.\n\n404\n00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,594\nI've, I do like this one, it tends to give\nme the results that I need, but, you know,\n\n405\n00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:53,300\nheck you want to use this one, you want\nto use NSlookup, you know, go for it.\n\n406\n00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,490\nIt's, it's, it's your show.\n\n407\n00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,902\nI will admit though, there's a fast,\nthe has, there's nothing that makes\n\n408\n00:19:58,902 --> 00:20:02,140\nyou fell really cool as hacker as\ntyping something in the command line.\n\n409\n00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,490\nCuz you feel really cool, right?\n\n410\n00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,050\n>> What is it about that, that just makes\nyou feel a little bit more powerful?\n\n411\n00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,580\n>> Yeah, you're like.\n\n412\n00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,500\n>> You're clicking on a button and\nhaving it do it for you.\n\n413\n00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,460\nIt's like,\nI want to set the record type to SOA and\n\n414\n00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,230\nthen query that domain within NS lookup.\n\n415\n00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,158\nYou know?\nI feel better then typing it into field\n\n416\n00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,510\nand clicking a button.\n\n417\n00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,040\nYeah, you oh master hacker.\n\n418\n00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,655\nHow dare they deny my power?\n\n419\n00:20:19,655 -->

00:20:28,340\nWhen's the last time you saw\none's going type, type click?\n\n422\n00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> Look at how cool I am.\n\n423\n00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,220\n>> Right.\n>> No it's usually someone\n\n424\n00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,440\nyou know doing the stuff\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n425\n00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,570\n>> and\nthere's the it's all it's all green.\n\n426\n00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,156\n>> Flying off the\n>> Yeah, you got all those,\n\n427\n00:20:35,156 --> 00:20:36,490\nyou got all those cool thing.\n\n428\n00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,651\nSo yeah, got to,\n\n429\n00:20:37,651 --> 00:20:41,400\nyou got to remember to be you got to\nremember to look cool doing this.\n\n430\n00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,000\nThat's the important thing.\n\n431\n00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,610\n>> But yeah DNS is a, is a big problem.\n\n432\n00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,640\nBecause it is a roadmap to\nyour entire network, right?\n\n433\n00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,740\n>> That's it.\n>> I mean, if you get into that zone file,\n\n434\n00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,960\nit's everyone of your computer's names and\nIP addresses.\n\n435\n00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,140\nIt's all the SRV records so I can find out\nwhich machines are offering what services.\n\n436\n00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,060\n>> And it tell me who

safe.\n\n442\n00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,910\nAnd I, you know?\nI think back to the Windows 2000 days.\n\n443\n00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,680\nWhen you installed DNS, the default was.\n\n444\n00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,890\nAllow his own transfer to any server.\n\n445\n00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,500\n>> Yeah,\n>> The default, so\n\n446\n00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,290\nI could take I could take any computer,\nconnect to your network,\n\n447\n00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,610\nopen up the command prompt, and request\na copy of your zone file, and I was done.\n\n448\n00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,961\n>> Yeah, and\n>> You know, it's, it's, we should take,\n\n449\n00:21:25,961 --> 00:21:27,060\nwe should take a look.\n\n450\n00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,490\nLet's look, in fact, we'll,\nwe'll get to that one in a moment.\n\n451\n00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,740\nLet's talk about the first\npart of finding the records.\n\n452\n00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,166\n>> Okay.\n\n453\n00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:37,298\n>> Let's, let's look at,\nfirst of all, this MX tool box.\n\n454\n00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:41,340\nSo I, I, I, I got in this mxtoolbox.com,\n>> And\n\n455\n00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,200\nI can put in a a domain name in there.\n\n456\n00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,950\nSo if I put in, you know, I'm just gonna\nkeep you know, putting Microsoft in today.\n\n457\n00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,090\nI'll, I'll put that in there and,\nand what does it do?\n\n458\n00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,195\nIt, it spits back a a, a, a record.\n\n459\n00:21:56,195 --> 00:22:00,115\nWhat we have here is an MX\nrecord that tells us this is,\n\n460\n00:22:00,115 --> 00:22:04,455\nthis is what the value is, you say, okay,\nMicrosoft mail protection, outlook.com.\n\n461\n00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:06,005\nI have the IP address.\n\n462\n00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:09,135\nSo, okay, but here's the cool thing,\nis if you go through,\n\n463\n00:22:09,135 -->

to to look at.\n\n500\n00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:03,487\nYou can also kinda talk about what you\nwere, what you were getting to about\n\n501\n00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:07,592\ntransferring this Zone we, we do need\nto understand what a zone is first,\n\n502\n00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:10,395\njust in case you,\nyou don't understand that.\n\n503\n00:24:10,395 --> 00:24:13,835\nA zone is just a portion of the DNS\nname space that they've chopped up\n\n504\n00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,942\ninto pieces because not all\none server can handle it.\n\n505\n00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:19,577\nSo what they'll do is they'll chop it\nout and hand it out and break it down.\n\n506\n00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:21,452\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And provision it that way.\n\n507\n00:24:21,452 --> 00:24:26,152\nWell, that zone needs to be,\nif we have multiple DNS servers,\n\n508\n00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:30,142\nother DNS servers, if one's updated with\nthe current, or the zones updated on one,\n\n509\n00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:33,492\nthese other guys that work with it also\nneed to be aware of those changes.\n\n510\n00:24:33,492 --> 00:24:37,612\nSo, if the name to IP changes up here,\nthis guy down here, here needs to be, a,\n\n511\n00:24:37,612 --> 00:24:39,160\na, aware of that.\n\n512\n00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,860\nSo, the question is how does\nit become aware of that?\n\n513\n00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,690\nThat's what a zone transfer is.\n\n514\n00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:46,112\nThis one is up to date,\nthis one goes through and increments,\n\n515\n00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:50,570\nand increments the zone number and\nthat tells this one down here that hey,\n\n516\n00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,570\nyou got a higher zone number than one\ndown here so this one's more up to date.\n\n517\n00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:58,280\nIt gets that zone number,\nby the way, off off the the the,\n\n518\n00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,740\nthe start of authority record, SOA record.\n\n519\n00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,830\nThis one, it queries that.\n\n520\n00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,020\nThis one is incremented.\n\n521\n00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,460\nMine is less then that.\n\n522\n00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,192\nI need to get that version up,\nbecause that one is up-to-date.\n\n523\n00:25:07,192 --> 00:25:07,740\n>> Exactly.\n\n524\n00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,800\n>> And so it's transferred over.\n\n525\n00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,880\nWell, you know,\nas you as you were alluding to Mike,\n\n526\n00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,020\nthey got this the in\nWhen you transfer zones,\n\n527\n00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,460\nMicrosoft used to have it, where, and\nthis was in the Windows 2000 phase.\n\n528\n00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,118\n>> Yes.\n>> Which there\n\n529\n00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,512\nstill is a lot of Windows 2000\nsystems [CROSSTALK] around there.\n\n530\n00:25:22,512 --> 00:25:23,951\n>> Unfortunately [LAUGH].\n\n531\n00:25:23,951 --> 00:25:28,720\n>> There's still a lot of NT 4.0 systems\naround there, so it, it's scary.\n\n532\n00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,440\n>> Army.\n[LAUGH].\n\n533\n00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,372\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it's, it, yeah,\nwell, that, that's about true.\n\n534\n00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:37,610\nAnd to you, that NT4, that new,\nwe've got Windows for work groups.\n\n535\n00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:42,360\nSo, but it's you still have, you still\nhave some of these older systems around\n\n536\n00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,520\nthere, and so, you know,\nsitting around here.\n\n537\n00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,480\nSo what happens is, is that if you\nsee if you see that something, if\n\n538\n00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,220\nthey have the right port open, which we're\ngonna talk about in a later step, you\n\n539\n00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,650\ncould actually go through Nslookup and see\nif you can transfer a copy of the zone.\n\n540\n00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,440\nYou can do an ls space minus d and\nthen the name of that domain, and\n\n541\n00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,810\nsee if it will transfer a zo,\na copy of the zone to you.\n\n542\n00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,458\nUsually if you do that,\nIf I do that to, like, Microsoft.com.\n\n543\n00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,956\nYou know, [CROSSTALK] come back with.\n\n544\n00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:12,970\nYeah, refused it.\n\n545\n00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,990\nThat's what I wanna see.\n\n546\n00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:19,910\nNow, however, if I, if I look at, if I\nlook at the system and say, okay, well,\n\n547\n00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:23,070\ntight, let's do an ls dash d on there,\nand all it sends is, oh hey, here you go.\n\n548\n00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:23,690\nWhat do you want?\n\n549\n00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,200\nDoes that.\n\n550\n00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,400\nthat's entirely bad to see, you know,\nyou shouldn't do that, cause,\n\n551\n00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,540\nif you get a copy of that, as you said,\nit's a road map for that person's network.\n\n552\n00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,810\nSo, if you've got a copy of the zone,\nyou've got a copy of that road map, for\n\n553\n00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,938\nthe network and\n\n554\n00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:42,620\nyou can start really mapping out\nthings a lot more specifically.\n\n555\n00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,510\nAnd that's, that, that's not a disaster,\nbut you're getting really close.\n\n556\n00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,320\n>> Yeah, you know, at that point.\n\n557\n00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,170\n>> And, and one of the problems with DNS\nis it doesn't really have any built-in\n\n558\n00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,820\nways to encrypt those zone transfers.\n\n559\n00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,100\nYou know, there's some other\nthings we could bring in, and we,\n\n560\n00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,960\nyou know, we don't wanna get platform,\nspecific,\n\n561\n00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,770\nbut It could set up IP tunnels,\nMicrosoft's DNS has their you know,\n\n562\n00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,740\nactive directory integrated where\nwe concluded with that directory..\n\n563\n00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,030\nI see some comments in the,\nthe chatroom about IP DNS Sec and\n\n564\n00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,610\nI want to make sure everybody's clear with\nwhat DNS Sec is doing cuz I think a lot of\n\n565\n00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,180\npeople are under the impression that\nit's encrypting those DNS results, and\n\n566\n00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,950\nDNS Sec is more about.\n\n567\n00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,460\nDigitally signing the results, and\nmaking sure that when I get the,\n\n568\n00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,108\nwhen I queried the server, and\nI'm saying hey what's the IP address for\n\n569\n00:27:26,108 --> 00:27:31,500\nwww.so-and-so or clientfourteen.adatam.com\nthat result comes back,\n\n570\n00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,060\nit's digitally signed, it's not encrypted,\n\n571\n00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,620\nit's digitally signed by that DNS server\nusing the DNS server's private key.\n\n572\n00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:42,900\nI can retrieve the public key of\nthe DNS server Decrypt that signature,\n\n573\n00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,710\nto verify that I'm getting\nthe information from that server, and\n\n574\n00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,860\nnot some rogue DNS server\nthat's doing some fishing scan.\n\n575\n00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,800\nBut the information is\nnot being encrypted.\n\n576\n00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,899\nThe actual data that's\nbeing transferred So\n\n577\n00:27:53,899 --> 00:27:57,885\nDNS Sec is a way to prevent you know,\nphishing, scams, and things like that.\n\n578\n00:27:57,885 --> 00:28:00,905\nIt's not encrypting my data\nthat's traveling back and forth.\n\n579\n00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:01,785\n>> And, and see, it's great,\n\n580\n00:28:01,785 --> 00:28:05,655\nit's great because you've got some you've,\nyou've got some stuff here in the,\n\n581\n00:28:05,655 --> 00:28:08,462\nin the discussion group about\n>> Poisoning and stuff like that.\n\n582\n00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:09,203\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n583\n00:28:09,203 --> 00:28:10,518\n>> That's where DNS set comes in too.\n\n584\n00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:11,554\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Cuz I can.\n\n585\n00:28:11,554 --> 00:28:13,268\n>> So it offers that, but you're right,\nit doesn't do encryption,\n\n586\n00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:14,058\nit does that digital signing.\n\n587\n00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:14,894\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n588\n00:28:14,894 --> 00:28:17,536\n>> Portion of it.\nIt wasn't designed to do that.\n\n589\n00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,110\n>> Right.\n>> The stuff it does provide is\n\n590\n00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,140\nvery powerful.\n\n591\n00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,265\nAnd, and if used and the, used and\nunderstood, in the right context.\n\n592\n00:28:23,265 --> 00:28:24,040\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n593\n00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:27,710\n>> But no, encryption is a part of it so\nyou'd have to find some other way to bring\n\n594\n00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,670\nthat to the table,\n>> Right.\n\n595\n00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:29,170\n>> Which there are.\n\n596\n00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:29,760\n>> Yeah, mm-hmm.\n>> There, I mean,\n\n597\n00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,330\nthere are plenty of ways\nto accomplish that.\n\n598\n00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,190\n>> And, and typical DNS queries are not\nsomething that I need to encrypt.\n\n599\n00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,050\nThat's information that I,\nI want people to have.\n\n600\n00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,250\nYou know, if they're querying from my web\nsever, somebody intercepts the IP address\n\n601\n00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,300\nof my web server, well, they can just\nquery my DNS server and get the same info.\n\n602\n00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,370\nSo, I'm not trying to hide that.\n\n603\n00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,420\n>> Exactly.\n>> What we're talking about here is when\n\n604\n00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,810\nDNS servers are talking to each other\n>> And they're transferring that\n\n605\n00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:53,690\nentire zone, and some of that might be\nconfidential information that we want\n\n606\n00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,610\nto encrypt, and for that we set up\ntunnels, to protect that information, or\n\n607\n00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,360\ndo active directory integrated,\nor something like that.\n\n608\n00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,150\n>> Yeah, ex, exactly.\n\n609\n00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:05,220\nYou just You just gotta\nremember the basics here.\n\n610\n00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,280\nNow to talk about the zone\ntransfer situation here,\n\n611\n00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,890\nwhy Microsoft didn't do it, Microsoft\nactually started implementing like\n\n612\n00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,890\na lot of other DNS servers started\nimplementing a long time ago.\n\n613\n00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,420\nWas you know, in Microsoft, implemented\na long time ago as well, as they set up\n\n614\n00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,580\na situation where, if you, if you want\na copy of the zone you, basically\n\n615\n00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,010\neither had to be on a guest list, or\nsomeone had to manually add you in there.\n\n616\n00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,620\nCuz by default, it said,\n\n617\n00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,015\nI'm not transferring zones to anybody\nexcept except these servers on my network.\n\n618\n00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:36,640\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That was it.\n\n619\n00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,300\nThat's all you get.\n\n620\n00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,535\nSo, if you wanted to do that, you had to\ntell it that you wanted to allow that.\n\n621\n00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:43,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, that was much,\n\n622\n00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,450\nmuch more safer than it was before,\ncuz before,\n\n623\n00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,890\nthe default was to transfer it-\n>> Yeah.\n\n624\n00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,290\n>> When it was requested.\n\n625\n00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,295\nAnd unless you were, unless you knew that.\n\n626\n00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:52,000\n>> Um-hm.\n>> You didn't turn that off.\n\n627\n00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,220\n>> Yeah, if you didn't know where to look,\ngo to look and\n\n628\n00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,340\nsee where that setting was and\nchange it, yeah.\n\n629\n00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,100\nThen you're just sharing with everybody.\n\n630\n00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,180\n>> Yeah, remember when\n>> Sharing is caring.\n\n631\n00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,810\n>> Yeah, sharing is caring.\n\n632\n00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,480\nThat's what my mom told me.\n\n633\n00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,850\nYou know, so, the thing is you gotta,\nwhen you look at this type,\n\n634\n00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,980\nwhen you look at this type of situation\nit's a very good example of [INAUDIBLE],\n\n635\n00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,025\na very good example of the fact that\nsystems should be locked down by default.\n\n636\n00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:19,755\n>> Um-hm.\n>> When they ship from the manufacturer\n\n637\n00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:21,862\nand then you should have to\nenable the stuff that you need.\n\n638\n00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:22,547\n>> Right.\n\n639\n00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:24,867\n>> Instead of just having it where\nit just offers everything up and\n\n640\n00:30:24,867 --> 00:30:26,580\nthen you turn off what you don't.\n\n641\n00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,482\nIt, it's just a bad situation.\n\n642\n00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:31,190\nMicrosoft It's just one.\n\n643\n00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,770\nIt's not the only one.\n\n644\n00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,940\nIt's one of the most visibly picked\non ones that have that issue.\n\n645\n00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,190\n>> And they've definitely made a change,\nyou know, 2000 shift open.\n\n646\n00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,990\nAnd it was easy to administer, and\neverything was on and available and\n\n647\n00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:44,182\nyou could do a lot.\n\n648\n00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:45,010\n>> Once secured.\n\n649\n00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,960\n>> But it seems like 2003 kind of\nwent the complete opposite end and\n\n650\n00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,242\nlocked everything down and\nmade everything difficult.\n\n651\n00:30:51,242 --> 00:30:53,210\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> There was a complete paradigm shift and\n\n652\n00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:53,820\nthought shift.\n\n653\n00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,710\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n654\n00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,730\nAnd then 2008, I think they finally\nfound that balance point where\n\n655\n00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,810\neverything is very modular, it's all\nthe pieces you need and things like that.\n\n656\n00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,375\nSo, they're getting it, so.\nI don't want to Microsoft bash too much.\n\n657\n00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,360\nBut.\n>> Yeah,\n\n658\n00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,732\nI don't want to make it sound\nlike I'm anti Microsoft.\n\n659\n00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:08,256\n>> Right.\n\n660\n00:31:08,256 --> 00:31:09,428\n>> I'm just, you know,\n\n661\n00:31:09,428 --> 00:31:13,310\nI'm just using that as an example\nof what most of us can relate to.\n\n662\n00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,932\nSo but they're not that far from\nbeing the only one that's done that.\n\n663\n00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:20,420\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Allright, so a lot of tools we can use.\n\n664\n00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,380\nYou know, once you get that DNS info, we,\nwe use tools like MX Toolbox or MX Lookup,\n\n665\n00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,580\nand there are several others out there.\n\n666\n00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,020\nAnd, and how did we get this started?\n\n667\n00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,915\nWell, we did our Who Is.\n\n668\n00:31:29,915 --> 00:31:33,790\nAllright, and we started looking at, and\nwe got the names or IP addresses of these\n\n669\n00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,460\nDNS servers And then we could turn around,\nand start using some of these tools to\n\n670\n00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,725\nquery those DNS servers, and see what\nkind of information we can get back.\n\n671\n00:31:40,725 --> 00:31:41,463\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n672\n00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:41,966\nExactly.\n\n673\n00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:42,719\n>> Very powerful stuff.\n\n674\n00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:44,055\nVery powerful stuff.\n\n675\n00:31:44,055 --> 00:31:46,720\nAllright, but\nDNS info is not the only thing.\n\n676\n00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,083\nGo to web server data.\n\n677\n00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:52,240\nHow about that?\n>> Yeah, that's the next step.\n\n678\n00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,120\nIs that going and\ndigging up stuff on the web server.\n\n679\n00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,005\nWhen we start having this that's,\nwe go in and\n\n680\n00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:03,450\nwe already have when you start to pull\nup A records and stuff like that.\n\n681\n00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Those A records tell us,\n\n682\n00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,595\nwell here's where your web server is.\n\n683\n00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:09,235\n>> Right.\n\n684\n00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:11,905\n>> So,you did have name server stuff.\n\n685\n00:32:11,905 --> 00:32:13,655\nYou did have mail server stuff.\n\n686\n00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:15,055\nBut yeah, what about those A records?\n\n687\n00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:17,125\nThose A records point to something.\n\n688\n00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,855\nAnd so in cases of the stuff\nwe're talking about here.\n\n689\n00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,551\nPull out a who is or do an NS look up.\n\n690\n00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:27,457\nThat very well could be the web server,\nin which case you can go through and\n\n691\n00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:29,106\npenetrate that at that point.\n\n692\n00:32:29,106 --> 00:32:29,706\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n693\n00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:32,170\n>> Or start gaining\ninformation at the very least.\n\n694\n00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,178\n>> Right.\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n695\n00:32:34,178 --> 00:32:38,105\nSo there's just so much information\nlike you said that DNS can expose.\n\n696\n00:32:38,105 --> 00:32:38,925\nIt's needed.\n\n697\n00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:39,855\nIt's necessary, right?\n\n698\n00:32:39,855 --> 00:32:42,115\nWe've got to be able to connect\nup to other machines and\n\n699\n00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:44,905\njust be able to find a domain\ncontroller to log on.\n\n700\n00:32:44,905 --> 00:32:48,235\nYou know, we just have to make sure\nthat we're keeping that information.\n\n701\n00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:51,292\nMake it only available to\nwho needs it and, and, and\n\n702\n00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,685\ndoing the split brain DNS if we need to.\n\n703\n00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:57,350\nLike you saw Microsoft,\nwe were able query their DNS server.\n\n704\n00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,960\nWe didn't get any information about\ninternal clients, SRV records or\n\n705\n00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,840\nanything like that, right?\n\n706\n00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,610\nIt was just their name servers, and\n\n707\n00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,680\ntheir, I think we got one web server\nURL or a couple web server URLs.\n\n708\n00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,747\nJust stuff that they want you to have.\n\n709\n00:33:09,747 --> 00:33:11,830\nTheir mail server,\none of their mail servers.\n\n710\n00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,937\nSo we can send mail to microsoft.com.\n\n711\n00:33:13,937 --> 00:33:14,437\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n712\n00:33:14,437 --> 00:33:15,735\n>> So they're doing a good job of that.\n\n713\n00:33:15,735 --> 00:33:19,866\nKeeping, that's a good example of limiting\nwhat's exposed or what's being available,\n\n714\n00:33:19,866 --> 00:33:22,250\nor what's being exposed to the public.\n\n715\n00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:22,750\n>> Absolutely.\n\n716\n00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,540\n>> Are we, I'm not sure on our time frame?\n\n717\n00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,410\nHow are we?\n\n718\n00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,050\nKeep on truckin'?\n\n719\n00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,130\nWe're gonna keep on truckin'.\n\n720\n00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:29,840\nAll right.\n\n721\n00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,790\nSo, next on our list we talk about,\nyou know, retrieving web server data,\n\n722\n00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,860\nso this is gonna be, we saw how\nwe can get information about DNS.\n\n723\n00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,550\nNow we're talking about pulling\ninformation about their actual servers,\n\n724\n00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,520\ntheir web servers?\n\n725\n00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,880\n>> Yeah,\nlet's take this to the next level and\n\n726\n00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,945\nstart getting information out of the,\nout of this system.\n\n727\n00:33:45,945 --> 00:33:49,260\n>> Mm-hm.\nAnd one of the ways we can do that,\n\n728\n00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,190\nmost fascinating to us,\nit's an old tool called Netcraft.\n\n729\n00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:53,690\n>> Netcraft.\n\n730\n00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,371\n>> Yeah, Netcraft.\n\n731\n00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:57,281\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Before there was Warcraft,\n\n732\n00:33:57,281 --> 00:33:58,230\nthere was Netcraft.\n\n733\n00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,154\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stop playing Warcraft while I'm\n\n734\n00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:01,733\ntalking.\n\n735\n00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:06,103\n[LAUGH]\n>> They have been around a long time.\n\n736\n00:34:06,103 --> 00:34:11,028\n>> [LAUGH] So,\nwhat we have here is Netcraft\n\n737\n00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:15,857\nis a site that offers a lot of things.\n\n738\n00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:20,497\nBut what we have, what we're going to\nlook at here is just a portion of it.\n\n739\n00:34:20,497 --> 00:34:25,821\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\ntype in again, I'm gonna type in,\n\n740\n00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:29,827\nmicrosoft.com, and\nhere's what is returned.\n\n741\n00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:32,950\nWhen you look at microsoft.com, well, wow,\n\n742\n00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,250\nit found 278 sites for\nmicrosoft.com, right?\n\n743\n00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,170\n>> Wow, look at that.\n\n744\n00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n745\n00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,555\n>> Holy cow.\n>> Yeah, Microsoft is everywhere.\n\n746\n00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,026\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Head for the hills.\n\n747\n00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:43,818\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n748\n00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:44,990\n>> Holy shoot.\n\n749\n00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,250\nI tell you what, before we dive that looks\nlike some great results and I think we're\n\n750\n00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,720\ngonna go a little bit further into\nsome of this web server information.\n\n751\n00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,351\nI lost track of the time there guys so\nit's time for\n\n752\n00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:56,590\nus to wrap up that particular segment.\n\n753\n00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,347\nStay tuned, we'll be right\nback with more footprinting.\n\n754\n00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:07,080\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n755\n00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,610\n>> All right.\n\n756\n00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,940\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n757\n00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,500\nSo we're continuing on with our CEH and\nwe left off\n\n758\n00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,520\ntalking about Netcraft I think, and\ngetting, retrieving web server data.\n\n759\n00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,450\nLeft you guys with a little cliffhanger\nthere, so let's dive back into that.\n\n760\n00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,335\n>> Yeah, we're trying new stuff.\n\n761\n00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:23,133\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Keep you in a,\n\n762\n00:35:23,133 --> 00:35:26,137\nlet's just put a cliffhanger in there and\nsee what happens.\n\n763\n00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:27,136\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n764\n00:35:27,136 --> 00:35:28,472\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n765\n00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:35,879\n>> So, just to recap what Netcraft is.\n\n766\n00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:40,306\nNetcraft is a web site\nthat is used to search on,\n\n767\n00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:45,440\nto basically search on\ninformation on web sites.\n\n768\n00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,520\nNow, before the break I had, or\nbefore, yeah before the break.\n\n769\n00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,078\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n770\n00:35:49,078 --> 00:35:53,774\n>> We had taken a look at\nrunning a query on Microsoft,\n\n771\n00:35:53,774 --> 00:35:59,252\non Microsoft.com specifically,\nand we saw the results.\n\n772\n00:35:59,252 --> 00:36:03,152\nAnd if we kinda zoom in here we\ncan see that, the results here,\n\n773\n00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:06,377\nwe could see in red we see\na lot of microsoft.coms.\n\n774\n00:36:06,377 --> 00:36:07,604\n>> We do.\n>> You know, 278 results.\n\n775\n00:36:07,604 --> 00:36:08,780\n>> Wow.\n\n776\n00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,813\n>> Seems like a lot.\n\n777\n00:36:09,813 --> 00:36:10,953\nMicrosoft's got a really,\n\n778\n00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:13,481\nwhen they say split personality\nthey got a split personality.\n\n779\n00:36:13,481 --> 00:36:15,420\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n780\n00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,696\n>> We've gone way beyond\nsplit DNS at this point.\n\n781\n00:36:18,696 --> 00:36:20,910\n>> Yes, yes.\n>> It's split personality, but,\n\n782\n00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,750\nif you start looking at these names a bit\nmore, these 270 bit, these 270 names.\n\n783\n00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,420\nThere's more to it than that.\n\n784\n00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,460\nYou see things in here like Tech Net,\nMSDN and Office.\n\n785\n00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,062\nWe see www.microsoft.com.\n\n786\n00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,815\nWell, at least we recognize that one,\nright?\n\n787\n00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:40,260\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, we see quite a bit of information.\n\n788\n00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:40,800\n>> Yeah we do.\nI mean, most\n\n789\n00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,490\nof these of these are sub-domains right.\n\n790\n00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,340\nI mean once you've.\n\n791\n00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,150\n>> You got it.\n\n792\n00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,010\n>> Once you've registered your DNS name,\nand\n\n793\n00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,620\nyou've got your second level domain,\nlike they registered Microsoft.com,\n\n794\n00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:55,720\nyou're free to do whatever you want\nto the left of that domain name.\n\n795\n00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,410\nSo you can add as many sub-domains\nthat you need in there.\n\n796\n00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,130\nAnd that's what they're doing.\n\n797\n00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,070\nThere are different reasons for\ncreating additional domains.\n\n798\n00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,420\nCould be administrative reasons,\ncould be security reasons, policy reasons,\n\n799\n00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,910\ndifferent reasons you'd create\nthose additional sub domains.\n\n800\n00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,508\nBut they definitely have a few,\ndon't they?\n\n801\n00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:12,016\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n802\n00:37:12,016 --> 00:37:12,525\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n803\n00:37:12,525 --> 00:37:13,325\n>> Exactly right.\n\n804\n00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:14,035\n>> Like to see their\n\n805\n00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:14,646\nforest maps.\n\n806\n00:37:14,646 --> 00:37:15,493\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n807\n00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:18,437\n[LAUGH] Yeah it's, and you're gonna,\n\n808\n00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:22,613\nthis is not an uncommon situation.\nThis is not something that Microsoft just\n\n809\n00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:25,410\nmade for themselves.\nYou will notice that there's actually\n\n810\n00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,303\na lot of places where they have\nsub domains set up like that.\n\n811\n00:37:29,303 --> 00:37:34,295\nSo, what we're seeing here is\nwe're seeing a map of sub domains,\n\n812\n00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:38,170\ncuz like we said, 278 sub domains.\n\n813\n00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,900\nThis is useful stuff, like you said,\nanything to the left,\n\n814\n00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,545\nyou are free to do what you want with.\n\n815\n00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:44,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n816\n00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,240\n>> What do people do with that?\n\n817\n00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,420\nI'm not saying Microsoft does this, but\n\n818\n00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,835\nit's not uncommon to see people do\nbeta versions of their website.\n\n819\n00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Do things for testing.\n\n820\n00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,431\nDo things for various projects.\n\n821\n00:37:55,431 --> 00:37:59,860\nHave sub-domains broken off and saying,\nhere is your portion of the name space.\n\n822\n00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,700\nSo, you see those type of things done.\n\n823\n00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,840\nBut the thing about,\n\n824\n00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,820\nto remember is why you do see that,\nyou do see those things being done.\n\n825\n00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,570\nWhat if the website is being used for\ntests?\n\n826\n00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:11,500\nWhat if it's being used by a project\nthat the people are focused\n\n827\n00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,990\non something other than security?\n\n828\n00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:13,590\n>> Right.\n\n829\n00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:16,235\n>> You now have found\na backdoor to this system.\n\n830\n00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:16,890\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n831\n00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,440\n>> You potentially found that.\n\n832\n00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,790\nI mean, if I see something\nthat says beta.whatever.com\n\n833\n00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,900\nI'm gonna take a closer look.\n\n834\n00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,460\nCuz that very well could be\nsomething that they're using for\n\n835\n00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,310\ntests, hence the term beta.\n\n836\n00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,608\nAnd that may be some code or\n\n837\n00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:33,049\nsomething there that's a little kinda\nfunky that I can use to get in.\n\n838\n00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:34,628\n>> Mm.\n>> And manipulate.\n\n839\n00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:38,640\nSo, these would be things that\ncould come into play now.\n\n840\n00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,650\nMight very well come into play later.\n\n841\n00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:44,106\nNow, let me show you when\nyou go into Netcraft.\n\n842\n00:38:44,106 --> 00:38:49,840\nNetcraft, the thing about it is,\nis that if I scroll up in here.\n\n843\n00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,770\nAnd if I was to go back to my main page.\n\n844\n00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:54,890\nAnd it says, okay, when,\ngo over here, with that site running.\n\n845\n00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,200\nIf I type in www.microsoft.com.\n\n846\n00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:01,060\nWatch how the results actually change.\n\n847\n00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,345\nIt's gonna scan around and generate\nsomething that's entirely different.\n\n848\n00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:05,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n849\n00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,720\n>> Okay, the reason for that is,\nis when you fully say www.microsoft.com,\n\n850\n00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,840\nthat's a fully qualified domain name.\n\n851\n00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,370\nIt goes directly to it.\n\n852\n00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:18,150\nIf you say microsoft.com, it knows\nthat there's stuff underneath that,\n\n853\n00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,725\nthat it can show you and\nit doesn't know which one.\n\n854\n00:39:21,725 --> 00:39:22,845\n>> Right.\n>> So it's asking you,\n\n855\n00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:23,905\nwhere do you want to go?\n\n856\n00:39:23,905 --> 00:39:26,085\n>> Yeah, cuz you you typed\nin an unqualified name, so\n\n857\n00:39:26,085 --> 00:39:27,515\nit has to make some assumptions.\n\n858\n00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:29,285\nAnd, it really doesn't assume much.\n\n859\n00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:30,085\nIt just says, all right,\n\n860\n00:39:30,085 --> 00:39:32,810\nwell I'm going to show you everything\nthat ends in microsoft.com,\n\n861\n00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:36,320\nyou're gonna get to pick which one you\nwanna dive into a little bit deeper.\n\n862\n00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,340\nOr maybe that's what you're looking for.\n\n863\n00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,150\nMaybe you want a list of\nthose sub domains like that.\n\n864\n00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,520\nLike you were saying, to look for\nbetas and, and different things.\n\n865\n00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,770\n>> Yeah,\nit's just something to think about.\n\n866\n00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:49,905\nWhen you do this with, if you're gonna\nuse a tool like this to do a search,\n\n867\n00:39:49,905 --> 00:39:51,520\ndo it in something generic.\n\n868\n00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,111\nSounds like,\nwell maybe that's a bad idea, right?\n\n869\n00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:56,646\nLet's get,\nI know specifically what I wanna look at.\n\n870\n00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:01,200\nWell, maybe there's some value\nin leaving it kinda fuzzy.\n\n871\n00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,730\nJust so we can get the whole\nrange of possibilities.\n\n872\n00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,083\nIt might open your eyes to other things.\n\n873\n00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:09,160\nSo do remember that.\n\n874\n00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,010\nSo and here what I have is I have\nwww.microsoft.com's results.\n\n875\n00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n876\n00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,890\n>> If you remember on the previous one\nwhen I did type in www.microsoft.com,\n\n877\n00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,781\nthere was a column there\nthat said site report and\n\n878\n00:40:20,781 --> 00:40:23,820\nit had a little paper\ndocument icon in there.\n\n879\n00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,730\nWhat that was is what I'm seeing here.\n\n880\n00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,080\nJust every icon that showed up, every\nsite that the icon showed up next to,\n\n881\n00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,800\nwould show a page similar to what I have\nhere, for that particular subdomain.\n\n882\n00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,950\nSo, there was a way to get to\nthis from the previous one.\n\n883\n00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,470\nI just wanted to kinda do a compare and\ncontrast the results so\n\n884\n00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,910\nyou recognize what you're seeing.\n\n885\n00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,235\n>> Okay, so if I go down this page and\n\n886\n00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:49,240\nstart looking at things,\nI start getting information about it.\n\n887\n00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,590\nLook, there's an IP address,\nthere's an IPv6 address, and\n\n888\n00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,140\nthere's name server information,\nstuff that we, and\n\n889\n00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:00,050\nyou may very well already have, but\nthat we're definitely getting there.\n\n890\n00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,720\nBut then we go down to the bottom of\nthis and you see net block owner.\n\n891\n00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,530\nYou see a bunch of IP\naddresses in there for this.\n\n892\n00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,240\nAnd okay, that's good.\n\n893\n00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,515\nWe see there's different IP\naddresses in there, to be sure.\n\n894\n00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n895\n00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,850\n>> Well, we should ask ourselves why\ndo we see different IP addresses?\n\n896\n00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,820\nIt could be doing a round\nrobin type situation,\n\n897\n00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,290\nwhere it's bouncing from\nserver to server to server.\n\n898\n00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,290\nIt could be that they moved it.\n\n899\n00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,940\nMore than likely it's some sort of\nround robin situation where it's\n\n900\n00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,050\nbouncing it from distributing\nit among multiple servers.\n\n901\n00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,665\n>> Right.\n\n902\n00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,840\n>> So that's probably what we're seeing.\n\n903\n00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,398\nBut then you kind of,\nif you look at the columns on here,\n\n904\n00:41:42,398 --> 00:41:46,716\nif you look at the columns COS and\nweb server,\n\n905\n00:41:46,716 --> 00:41:50,253\nIS 8 and IS 8.5 running on Linux.\n\n906\n00:41:50,253 --> 00:41:53,017\nMike, when's was the last\ntime you saw that [CROSSTALK]\n\n907\n00:41:53,017 --> 00:41:54,783\n>> I mean can I run IS on Linux?\n\n908\n00:41:54,783 --> 00:41:58,755\nI was trying to crash my brain real\nquick and say wait, wait, can you?\n\n909\n00:41:58,755 --> 00:42:03,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you guys need to, you can Google it\n\n910\n00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:10,483\nif you want or I can save you the trouble\nand say, no they do not make IS for Linux.\n\n911\n00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:11,117\n>> No.\n\n912\n00:42:11,117 --> 00:42:13,355\n>> That would be pretty funny.\n\n913\n00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:15,372\n>> That would be funny to have a port for\nLinux.\n\n914\n00:42:15,372 --> 00:42:17,190\nBut yeah,\nthey've got their own web server, Apache.\n\n915\n00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:20,690\nAnd most people prefer Apache anyway,\nI think, over iOS most of the time.\n\n916\n00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:21,620\n>> Yeah, it's true.\n\n917\n00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,235\nApache still is one of the more\ndominant web servers out there.\n\n918\n00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:25,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> At least for publicly\n\n919\n00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,880\navailable websites.\n\n920\n00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,760\nMaybe internally and\nthings like that we might use iOS because\n\n921\n00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,755\nwe've got a Microsoft\nserver sitting there.\n\n922\n00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:31,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n923\n00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,860\nAbsolutely.\n\n924\n00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,850\n>> But anyhow, looking at that OS,\nI don't know if we've used that term yet,\n\n925\n00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,030\nfingerprinting the OS?\n\n926\n00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,840\nAnd I know we're gonna talk more\nabout that in some later episodes,\n\n927\n00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,490\nbut I mean this is pretty easy.\n\n928\n00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:46,670\nIt's telling me what I think, no,\nit could be wrong, though, right?\n\n929\n00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,220\n>> It could be wrong.\n\n930\n00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,495\nCould be right, too.\n\n931\n00:42:49,495 --> 00:42:53,152\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, there is something happening here.\n\n932\n00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:57,322\nThis is, and\nas I can see Fabian put in here, Linux OS?\n\n933\n00:42:57,322 --> 00:42:58,225\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n934\n00:42:58,225 --> 00:42:59,197\n>> It's like, hm?\n\n935\n00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:01,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, if you see that and\n\n936\n00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,590\nyou're kinda surprised, yeah,\nit is actually correct.\n\n937\n00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,500\nIt is saying the OS is correct and\nthe web server's correct.\n\n938\n00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,740\nBut remember I told you\nin our early episodes,\n\n939\n00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,090\nyou gotta have that platform knowledge.\n\n940\n00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,600\nThis is where that comes into play.\n\n941\n00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:23,080\nThis is where you're more\nadvanced knowledge comes in\n\n942\n00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,460\nof infrastructure and stuff like that.\n\n943\n00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:29,046\nFirst of all, we just said that\nIS does not run on Linux, so\n\n944\n00:43:29,046 --> 00:43:32,550\nthere's something funky\nwith that combination.\n\n945\n00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:36,065\nBut I also told you that both of those\nthings on there are true statements.\n\n946\n00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:37,290\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n947\n00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:39,110\n>> Okay, so there isn't anything wrong,\n\n948\n00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:41,210\nbut that seems hard to\nreconcile doesn't it?\n\n949\n00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:41,718\n>> It does, it does.\n\n950\n00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:44,140\n>> It's like, its information's incorrect,\nbut you're saying it's true,\n\n951\n00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,030\nso what is it?\n\n952\n00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,340\nWell, the thing in here is, is that\nfirst of all let's look at some stuff.\n\n953\n00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,790\nWhen we see web server 8.5 and 8.0.\n\n954\n00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,650\nWell, let's talk about that for a moment.\n\n955\n00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:57,726\nLet's kinda clarify that.\n\n956\n00:43:57,726 --> 00:43:59,730\nSo, 8.0 and 8.5, I don't know,\n\n957\n00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:04,340\ndo you know off the top of\nyour head what those run on?\n\n958\n00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,720\n>> That would be off of Windows, right?\n\n959\n00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,936\n>> It would be Windows server\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n960\n00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:13,210\n>> 8.0's gonna be server 2012.\n\n961\n00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:14,879\n8.5's gonna be 2012 R2.\n\n962\n00:44:14,879 --> 00:44:17,720\n>> Okay.\n>> So, you can check that.\n\n963\n00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,775\nYou can go to Microsoft's website and\nsearch it.\n\n964\n00:44:21,775 --> 00:44:22,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And see that.\n\n965\n00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,970\nYou can go to Google and find it.\n\n966\n00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,740\nOh, sorry, you can go to Bing\n>> There you go.\n\n967\n00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,265\n>> And find it.\n\n968\n00:44:26,265 --> 00:44:26,927\n>> [LAUGHTER].\n\n969\n00:44:26,927 --> 00:44:28,560\n>> Microsoft product, right?\n\n970\n00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,280\nSo gotta say something\npositive about them today.\n\n971\n00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,020\nSo you can verify that, and\nsee that's the actual case, but okay,\n\n972\n00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,400\nso, Windows is there.\n\n973\n00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,920\nWe know IS doesn't run\nanything else except Windows.\n\n974\n00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,000\nSo we know that 2012 OS should say 2012.\n\n975\n00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,230\nWhy does it say Linux?\n\n976\n00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,080\nIf it's true, why does it say Linux?\n\n977\n00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,190\nLoad balancer more than likely.\n\n978\n00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:52,810\n>> Mm.\n>> There's\n\n979\n00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:55,160\na load balancer sitting in front of it.\n\n980\n00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,237\n>> Gotcha.\n>> So I'm almost willing to bet.\n\n981\n00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:01,529\nI see virtual machine here,\nwhat Sean's mentioning it.\n\n982\n00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:06,370\nWhat happens is is that it\ncould be a virtual machine.\n\n983\n00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:13,160\nI'm making a guess that this is probably\na load balancer in this situation.\n\n984\n00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:17,950\nThat's what my gut tells me, but what you\nhave is you have the load balancer that\n\n985\n00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,940\nall your requests are coming in through,\nand distributes it among multiple systems.\n\n986\n00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:25,700\nThat may explain the different\nIPs we're seeing in here,\n\n987\n00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,700\nthat it's bouncing it back and\nforth between these things.\n\n988\n00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,620\nSo what's happening is when\nit fingerprints this and\n\n989\n00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,360\nit's trying to identify it, it's more\nthan likely it's fingerprinting the OS.\n\n990\n00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,240\nIt's doing a ping or something\nagainst that and it returns back.\n\n991\n00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,200\nThat's at the OS level, so\nthe OS is returning hey, I'm Linux.\n\n992\n00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,210\nAnd then it's doing a header grab against\nthe web server and pulling that and\n\n993\n00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,380\nsaying okay, I am IS.\n\n994\n00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,700\nAnd so it spits this back and\nseems illogical to look at that.\n\n995\n00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,800\nBut it's totally logical when\nyou understand that you may have\n\n996\n00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:00,755\nhad that light come on and\nsay oh, that makes sense.\n\n997\n00:46:00,755 --> 00:46:05,130\n>> That makes perfect sense [LAUGH]\n>> That's a prime example\n\n998\n00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,268\nof platform environment knowledge.\n\n999\n00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:11,975\nIt seems like earlier on when I said that\nits like of course I'd need to know that.\n\n1000\n00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:14,960\nWell, this is an example.\n\n1001\n00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,930\nThis is about as good as an example\nas you can get, as far as that goes.\n\n1002\n00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:23,220\nWould you be able to reason that out\nwithout having your platform knowledge?\n\n1003\n00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,920\nI assume you would be able to without\nhaving that platform knowledge and\n\n1004\n00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,020\nthat detailed knowledge, but\nit might take you longer.\n\n1005\n00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:32,040\nYou might have to ask questions of\nsomeone who is more knowledgeable.\n\n1006\n00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,100\nSo, remember situations like that.\n\n1007\n00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,692\nThere's probably somebody that looked at\nthat initially, and they're like yeah,\n\n1008\n00:46:36,692 --> 00:46:37,340\nthat doesn't do it.\n\n1009\n00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:42,240\nI saw someone said, there's no public\nversion of IS that runs on Linux.\n\n1010\n00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,250\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n1011\n00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:48,100\n>> Okay, you could say that potentially\nthat Microsoft decided to expose\n\n1012\n00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,880\ntheir-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1013\n00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,661\n>> Expose themselves this way, and\n\n1014\n00:46:50,661 --> 00:46:51,809\nsay oops, we did it.\n\n1015\n00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,666\n>> [CROSSTALK] Cuz there's such\na demand of iOS on other platforms.\n\n1016\n00:46:54,666 --> 00:46:55,849\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1017\n00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:56,372\n>> Yeah.\n\n1018\n00:46:56,372 --> 00:46:59,809\nYeah and so it, again,\nI'm not picking on you for saying that.\n\n1019\n00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:03,930\nThat's a valid statement to make.\n\n1020\n00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,100\nBut more likely,\nthis is not where you'd actually see that.\n\n1021\n00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,716\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So once you think it in this case,\n\n1022\n00:47:08,716 --> 00:47:11,400\nit's more than likely that\nthat's the situation.\n\n1023\n00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,285\nCould it be a virtual machine?\n\n1024\n00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:20,672\nYeah, at this point,\nthere's possibly a potential that it could\n\n1025\n00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:25,864\nbe a virtual machine there, but\nthe way I look at the situation,\n\n1026\n00:47:25,864 --> 00:47:29,690\nit's more than likely it's a load problem\n>> Yeah,\n\n1027\n00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:33,355\nIf the virtual machine was running\nWindows and running iOS, you would think\n\n1028\n00:47:33,355 --> 00:47:36,964\nyour fingerprinting would then pull\nback the correct operating system and\n\n1029\n00:47:36,964 --> 00:47:39,856\nin a long way-\n>> It might very well There still could\n\n1030\n00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:44,605\nbe some things that could ID it this way,\nbut, something just tells me on this\n\n1031\n00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:50,110\nsituation that's more likely that's some\nsort of load balancer in there doing that.\n\n1032\n00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,350\nSo just makes it,\njust tends to make more sense.\n\n1033\n00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,030\n>> Nice.\n\n1034\n00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,220\nSo, but there you go.\n\n1035\n00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:58,450\nThere's your platform knowledge in action.\n\n1036\n00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:04,500\nAs we scroll down, you can see additional\ninformation about that domain and\n\n1037\n00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,870\nnot every domain is gonna have\nthis amount of information.\n\n1038\n00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:15,050\nBut you could, not every website's\ngetting this amount of information.\n\n1039\n00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,110\nBut if you do have it,\nsomething you should note,\n\n1040\n00:48:18,110 --> 00:48:22,150\nif you're looking at here on the screen,\nlook at the Site Technology.\n\n1041\n00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,800\nYou know, Site Ttechnology,\nwhat does it have?\n\n1042\n00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,420\nHey, it's using ASP.net.\n\n1043\n00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,710\nThat's gonna be useful.\n\n1044\n00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1045\n00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,300\n>> And we look at, it's got SSL.\n\n1046\n00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,440\nOkay, well, that's something to file away.\n\n1047\n00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,070\nJavascript, file that away.\n\n1048\n00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:37,360\njQuery, file that away.\n\n1049\n00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,080\nYou know, there's, and you see advertising\nnetworks and stuff like that, okay fine.\n\n1050\n00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,540\nAnd character encoding,\nHTTP information, this is all very,\n\n1051\n00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,320\nvery, very good stuff to have.\n\n1052\n00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,352\nYou know, so-\n>> Yeah,\n\n1053\n00:48:49,352 --> 00:48:52,943\nthis is all information that I can use\nin some of the later phases of my attack\n\n1054\n00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:57,389\nprocess, for example, because knowing what\nthey're running, knowing what OS, knowing\n\n1055\n00:48:57,389 --> 00:49:01,740\nwhat technologies, what they're allowing,\nall those have vulnerabilities, r ight?\n\n1056\n00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,270\nAnd so that's what we were talking\nabout in the earlier thing.\n\n1057\n00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,570\nWe started with all this information,\nwe narrowed it down to what we need,\n\n1058\n00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,905\nand this kind of information\ncan really help me.\n\n1059\n00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:11,628\nIt's like we said, we're gonna take\nthe results from this phase and\n\n1060\n00:49:11,628 --> 00:49:16,320\nuse that as the starting point or\nthe inter, the,,\n\n1061\n00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:21,410\nI'm trying to think of a good word to say\nthat but the input for the next phase.\n\n1062\n00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:23,686\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n1063\n00:49:23,686 --> 00:49:28,895\n>> Now some, there's some great things\nhere that I'm seeing in the group.\n\n1064\n00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:32,455\nMichael's saying,\ncould an admin set a fake banner?\n\n1065\n00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:33,455\nYeah, you could.\n\n1066\n00:49:33,455 --> 00:49:36,235\nThere's the,\nit's absolutely possible to do that.\n\n1067\n00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:41,640\nThe functionality's there and\npeople do do that thing,\n\n1068\n00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,730\nbut the question is, is it worth doing?\n\n1069\n00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:47,660\nIt's probably not gonna offer you a ton,\nand a lot of cases, and\n\n1070\n00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:51,910\nin fact, in some web applications,\ndoing that will actually break it.\n\n1071\n00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,060\n>> Cause something to fail,\njust not reading it right.\n\n1072\n00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:57,820\n>> Yeah, so you wouldn't want to do that.\n\n1073\n00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:01,760\nThese other ones that you have,\nWine on Linux to run Windows programs.\n\n1074\n00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:06,980\nThat would, I don't know if you're\nreferring to that for running IIS.\n\n1075\n00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:10,780\nYou can't really, as far as I know,\nextricate IIS enough from\n\n1076\n00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,780\nWindows to actually even say,\nI'm gonna put it over here.\n\n1077\n00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,290\nSo.\n\n1078\n00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,470\n>> Like I said earlier,\nthere's no public version of IIS.\n\n1079\n00:50:16,470 --> 00:50:18,320\nYou can't just go out and download IIS.\n\n1080\n00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n1081\n00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,118\n>> No.\n>> And you couldn't, as far as I know,\n\n1082\n00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:24,043\nyou can't really kludge\nsomething to put together,\n\n1083\n00:50:24,043 --> 00:50:27,460\nand say, okay, yeah,\nI'm gonna put this on Linux.\n\n1084\n00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,186\nIt's pretty much out of the picture for\nthat.\n\n1085\n00:50:30,186 --> 00:50:32,479\nNow watch, someone is going\nto prove me wrong tomorrow.\n\n1086\n00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:33,228\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n1087\n00:50:33,228 --> 00:50:35,853\n>> Someone here is going to\ndrink a lot of Red Bull tonight.\n\n1088\n00:50:35,853 --> 00:50:38,062\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I did it man.\n\n1089\n00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:38,728\nWoo!\n\n1090\n00:50:38,728 --> 00:50:41,936\nRock and roll [LAUGH] that's on you, okay?\n\n1091\n00:50:41,936 --> 00:50:43,770\nSo.\n\n1092\n00:50:45,478 --> 00:50:47,700\n>> So yeah, so a lot of\ninformation is gonna be retrieved.\n\n1093\n00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,240\nWe're just seeing how much\ninformation is out there and\n\n1094\n00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,030\nas we go through our episodes,\nwe're going to see how we can\n\n1095\n00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:58,130\nthen turn that information into something\nuseful for the next part of our phases.\n\n1096\n00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,120\nSo we looked at netcraft.com.\n\n1097\n00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:00,978\nLot of information there.\n\n1098\n00:51:00,978 --> 00:51:04,499\nYou can pull up information\nabout a particular FQDN,\n\n1099\n00:51:04,499 --> 00:51:06,854\nlike we did www.microsoft.com.\n\n1100\n00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:11,834\nYou can do an unqualified name to try to\nfind some of those sub-domains that might\n\n1101\n00:51:11,834 --> 00:51:16,978\nnot be publicly available, or they're not\nreally trying to expose to the public.\n\n1102\n00:51:16,978 --> 00:51:20,160\nWe can find them that way, and then start\nlooking for hostnames within that, or\n\n1103\n00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,311\nstart finding information\nabout those other names.\n\n1104\n00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:26,479\nBecause as Shawn said, it could be\na subdomain that really wasn't meant for\n\n1105\n00:51:26,479 --> 00:51:28,823\npublic consumption, or is a beta thing and\n\n1106\n00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:33,270\nsecurity might not be at the forefront of\ntheir minds in that particular domain.\n\n1107\n00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:36,853\nBecause they don't expect people to be\nfinding it and trying to connect to it.\n\n1108\n00:51:36,853 --> 00:51:38,895\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1109\n00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:42,330\n>> So, all right, well some other\ntools we could use to dive or\n\n1110\n00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,061\nto grab some web server data.\n\n1111\n00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:47,853\n>> This next one is a favorite.\n\n1112\n00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:50,521\nIt's been around for quite a long time.\n\n1113\n00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:52,639\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's something called\n\n1114\n00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,020\nthe Wayback Machine.\n\n1115\n00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,312\nExtra points if you know what\nthe Wayback Machine first did.\n\n1116\n00:51:57,312 --> 00:52:00,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then you're like-\n\n1117\n00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:01,948\n>> I think our winner from yesterday,\n\n1118\n00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:05,686\nI think Michaela might have mentioned\nthe Wayback Machine earlier.\n\n1119\n00:52:05,686 --> 00:52:07,812\nGreat, I love this thing,\nI like to just go around in there.\n\n1120\n00:52:07,812 --> 00:52:10,728\n>> You remember where they got\nthe name Wayback Machine from?\n\n1121\n00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,811\nMr. Peabody, those things, going back.\n\n1122\n00:52:12,811 --> 00:52:13,770\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1123\n00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:14,645\n>> So.\n\n1124\n00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sherman,\n\n1125\n00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,979\nset the Wayback Machine, all right.\n\n1126\n00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:19,689\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n1127\n00:52:19,689 --> 00:52:23,478\nanyway what does\nthe Wayback Machine do for us?\n\n1128\n00:52:23,478 --> 00:52:27,637\nWell, it allows us to see old versions\nof websites and that's what we're gonna\n\n1129\n00:52:27,637 --> 00:52:31,561\nactually gonna do is, we're gonna look\nat some old versions of websites.\n\n1130\n00:52:31,561 --> 00:52:35,750\nNow, you may ask yourself,\nwhy is that useful?\n\n1131\n00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,690\nWell, someone may have had\ninformation up there at one point\n\n1132\n00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,630\nthat they shouldn't have.\n\n1133\n00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,720\nAnd so we can go out and\nfind that information,\n\n1134\n00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,040\neven though they thought it was gone,\nnothing's gone on the Internet.\n\n1135\n00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,870\nYou've all heard that before.\n\n1136\n00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,521\nSo, now we're gonna see some good examples\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1137\n00:52:52,521 --> 00:52:55,270\n>> Of stuff is never gone, so.\n\n1138\n00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:57,229\n>> [LAUGH] Let's go way back\nin the Wayback Machine.\n\n1139\n00:52:57,229 --> 00:52:59,343\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I remember,\n\n1140\n00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:03,425\nagain I've played a lot with this Wayback\nMachine, and you go back to these sites,\n\n1141\n00:53:03,425 --> 00:53:07,235\nand back in the 90s, we were putting\nall of our information on the website.\n\n1142\n00:53:07,235 --> 00:53:11,480\nWe were putting the CEOs and all the C's\nnames, and contact information, and\n\n1143\n00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,645\nall the IT departments, and\ntheir contact information.\n\n1144\n00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:17,228\nThis was all on our public website, right?\n\n1145\n00:53:17,228 --> 00:53:23,770\n>> That's 100% correct, and\nyou weren't the only one.\n\n1146\n00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:25,020\nThere was a lot of people that did it.\n\n1147\n00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean how many people did you hear\n\n1148\n00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:31,230\nabout back in the day when the internet\nwas becoming popular in the mid 90s,\n\n1149\n00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,050\nthat they were saying we need\nto get that web address.\n\n1150\n00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:35,610\n>> Yeah..\n>> Why do we need a website?\n\n1151\n00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:36,570\nCuz we need a website.\n\n1152\n00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,480\nThere was no real thing.\n\n1153\n00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,311\nThey would buy a domain name, buy\nhosting and okay, now we can [CROSSTALK]\n\n1154\n00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:41,913\n>> Nothing to do but\n\n1155\n00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:44,020\nthey just [SOUND] all their\ncompany information out there.\n\n1156\n00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,627\n>> Yeah.\nThey're like,\n\n1157\n00:53:45,627 --> 00:53:49,720\nneed to find, they had a solution\nin search of a problem.\n\n1158\n00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so they would put stuff up there,\n\n1159\n00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:54,280\nand you'd get all sorts\nof just goofy things.\n\n1160\n00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:56,770\nAnd, it was stuff like you mentioned.\n\n1161\n00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,682\nIt was stuff like telling remote\npeople that work in remote,\n\n1162\n00:53:59,682 --> 00:54:01,520\nhow to attach to email, a VPN remote.\n\n1163\n00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,125\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n1164\n00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:06,675\nthey put a PDF up there with all the\ninstructions which happened to include IP\n\n1165\n00:54:06,675 --> 00:54:09,060\naddresses and stuff like that.\n\n1166\n00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,060\nYou know that was a treasure trove.\n\n1167\n00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,450\nSo someone along the way finally realized\nthat hey, that's a really dumb idea, so\n\n1168\n00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:15,950\nstop it.\n\n1169\n00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:21,270\nAnd that didn't become\na common practice anymore.\n\n1170\n00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,810\nHowever, those things are still there.\n\n1171\n00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:25,686\nThis may have very well caught it.\n\n1172\n00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:29,876\nSo what I have done here is I have,\nin the Wayback Machine,\n\n1173\n00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:32,290\nI've typed in Microsoft.com.\n\n1174\n00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,376\nWhat I can do is hit Enter on this and\n\n1175\n00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:39,645\nwhat it does is that it\nbrings up this calendar.\n\n1176\n00:54:39,645 --> 00:54:44,423\nAnd this calendar, this isn't, though,\nif you haven't used this in a while,\n\n1177\n00:54:44,423 --> 00:54:48,570\nyou will see, you may have seen\na different version of it, where it may\n\n1178\n00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:53,190\nhave looked a little differently but\nit still does the same thing.\n\n1179\n00:54:53,190 --> 00:54:56,204\nWhat I have here is,\nwhen you look at a page or\n\n1180\n00:54:56,204 --> 00:55:00,770\nlook at one of the dates on this calendar,\nyears on this calendar.\n\n1181\n00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:05,518\nWhat you'll see is you'll see the months\nlaid out in here and then each over,\n\n1182\n00:55:05,518 --> 00:55:10,230\neach day you see is a little blue bubble,\nthe size of the blue bubble.\n\n1183\n00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:13,400\nAnd it tells you how many\nchanges were made on that day.\n\n1184\n00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,853\nSo, if I hover over March 17th, I see,\nwell, heck, there's a lot of things.\n\n1185\n00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:20,311\n>> 21 different snapshots on that day.\n\n1186\n00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:23,890\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of snapshots\nthat were actually taken, you know.\n\n1187\n00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:27,388\nOr if I don't want to look at any of\nthese, I can go all the way back to 96.\n\n1188\n00:55:27,388 --> 00:55:32,747\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And say, okay What was going on in '96?\n\n1189\n00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:35,950\nSo, October 20th.\n\n1190\n00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,910\nOctober 20th is the date and\nyou ask what date is that?\n\n1191\n00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,530\nIt's the date that SkyNet came online.\n\n1192\n00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:44,410\nSo, that's what happened.\n\n1193\n00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,192\nIf anyone asks you,\njust a little trivia question.\n\n1194\n00:55:47,192 --> 00:55:49,000\nAll right, when I look in here,\nOctober 20, '96.\n\n1195\n00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,980\nLet's click on that and see what we get.\n\n1196\n00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,600\n>> Windows 95 was released.\n\n1197\n00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,280\nWait a minute.\n\n1198\n00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,060\nWhat are they doing?\n\n1199\n00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,264\n>> Publisher 97.\n\n1200\n00:55:56,264 --> 00:56:03,230\nVisual Basic 5, so\nwe've got some stuff there.\n\n1201\n00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:04,390\nNow this is,\n\n1202\n00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,990\nwhat I'm doing here is done just to\nshow you what can be done with this.\n\n1203\n00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:11,410\n>> Right.\n>> You could type in really any URL and\n\n1204\n00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,700\nsee if it has something\nin the database for you.\n\n1205\n00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,890\nThe key thing being if it has\nsomething in there for you.\n\n1206\n00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:21,650\nIt doesn't necessarily\nmean it's got anything.\n\n1207\n00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:26,240\nOkay, there are still plenty of URLs that\ndo not get caught by www.archive.org.\n\n1208\n00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,832\nI think www.archive.org says it gets\nabout anywhere from 10 to 15% of\n\n1209\n00:56:30,832 --> 00:56:33,660\nthe websites that are on the internet.\n\n1210\n00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,360\nAnd it's insane when you think of\njust how many sites that is, and\n\n1211\n00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,680\nit's still only 10 to 15% of\nthe internet that they estimate.\n\n1212\n00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,410\n>> So there's a chance,\n\n1213\n00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:47,790\nthere is a reasonable chance\nthat you're not in there.\n\n1214\n00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:50,940\nBut most of the big\ncompanies will be in there.\n\n1215\n00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:53,925\nSome small personal websites are in there.\n\n1216\n00:56:53,925 --> 00:56:56,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But some of those free websites,\n\n1217\n00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,430\nstuff like that,\nthey're just not gonna be caught by this.\n\n1218\n00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:01,980\nSo some of those things\nmay just be garbage sites.\n\n1219\n00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:04,315\nBut there may be some sites\nthat are being missed.\n\n1220\n00:57:04,315 --> 00:57:06,970\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1221\n00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,540\nAnd how far back does it go?\n\n1222\n00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,790\nWell, I've got almost 20 years of\nhistory here for Microsoft you mean.\n\n1223\n00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:17,430\nI think that kind of\nanswers your question.\n\n1224\n00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,020\nRight there,\n\n1225\n00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:23,080\nif you have that in your mind, we're going\nall the way back to '96 to see this.\n\n1226\n00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:27,020\nNow, if you click through stuff on here,\n\n1227\n00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,720\nsometimes you click on,\nhere's Publisher 97.\n\n1228\n00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,551\nYou click on that link.\n\n1229\n00:57:32,551 --> 00:57:36,010\nOkay, the link actually worked.\n\n1230\n00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,160\nIn some cases those links don't work.\n\n1231\n00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,040\nThe content just isn't there and\nthey didn't archive it.\n\n1232\n00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,980\nSo you may be hit and miss on some cases,\n\n1233\n00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,840\nbut don't be surprised if you\nfind stuff that's useful.\n\n1234\n00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,680\nI've had numerous clients that I've\nlooked at stuff in here and found stuff.\n\n1235\n00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,500\nMay not have always been useful, but\n\n1236\n00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,426\nit found some stuff, enough to actually\nimpersonate someone and say heck,\n\n1237\n00:58:00,426 --> 00:58:04,600\nI've been here back from the day\nwhen we had this, this, and this.\n\n1238\n00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,160\nLike oh, okay.\n\n1239\n00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:11,060\nThey don't know that that stuff is\nstill something I can find out there.\n\n1240\n00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:15,810\nIn a couple cases I actually found stuff\nlike you talked about as having a customer\n\n1241\n00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:19,998\ndatabase, or not customer,\nof having company directories up there and\n\n1242\n00:58:19,998 --> 00:58:23,410\nso it's kinda surprising to\npeople when they see that.\n\n1243\n00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:28,830\nNow, just for reference here,\n\n1244\n00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,420\nyes you can stop your stuff from\ngetting into www.archive.org.\n\n1245\n00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,250\nAll you have to do is go\ninto your web server and\n\n1246\n00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:38,740\nput something called a robots.txt\nin the root of your web server and\n\n1247\n00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,930\nyou can block by putting\nthe right entries in that file.\n\n1248\n00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:45,200\nYou can actually block this\nfrom archiving your stuff.\n\n1249\n00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:48,358\n>> Now, is that something that\nthe www.archive.org allows you to do and\n\n1250\n00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:50,934\nsays if you really don't want it,\nthis is what you can do or\n\n1251\n00:58:50,934 --> 00:58:52,815\nis that something somebody figured out?\n\n1252\n00:58:52,815 --> 00:58:55,420\n>> www.archive.org allows it.\n\n1253\n00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,270\nThey will tell you that,\nthat you can do that.\n\n1254\n00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,798\nThey will give you instructions saying\nthat if you don't want us to come in,\n\n1255\n00:58:59,798 --> 00:59:00,520\nthis is how you do it.\n\n1256\n00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,730\nThey completely understand that if\nyou don't want to have it archived.\n\n1257\n00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:09,446\nThen I saw in here in the discussion\ngroup to get personal information,\n\n1258\n00:59:09,446 --> 00:59:13,310\nhave they done anything to\ncleanse that information out?\n\n1259\n00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:17,530\nI'm not the best person to answer that.\n\n1260\n00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:20,720\nThat would be something that you\ncould probably ask them about,\n\n1261\n00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:25,590\nbut as far as I know, they are pretty\ncautious about what they get.\n\n1262\n00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:27,180\nAnd if they do get something in there,\n\n1263\n00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:30,870\nthey tend to be pretty good at policing\nstuff and removing things, but\n\n1264\n00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:35,650\nI don't know if there's any\nconcerted effort to do that.\n\n1265\n00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,440\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1266\n00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,320\nYeah, and sometimes it's fun just to go.\n\n1267\n00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:43,082\nWhen I've got some time, nothing to do,\nI'll hit the Wayback Machine just to kind\n\n1268\n00:59:43,082 --> 00:59:45,657\nof go back in time and\nlook at some of the, as we saw there,\n\n1269\n00:59:45,657 --> 00:59:48,721\nsometimes the graphics are missing\ncuz the links to where they store\n\n1270\n00:59:48,721 --> 00:59:51,710\nthe graphics are no longer available and\nthings like that.\n\n1271\n00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:54,860\nBut going back to these websites is\njust kind of going through the past and\n\n1272\n00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,130\nlooking at the roll out of Windows 98 and\nthings like that.\n\n1273\n00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,160\nBut for this class,\nreally what we want to focus on is\n\n1274\n01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,400\nthe fact that this is information that\nat one point somebody made available and\n\n1275\n01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,040\nthen we realized that\nthat's not the best thing.\n\n1276\n01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,150\nThat from a security perspective that\ninformation does not need to be available.\n\n1277\n01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:12,850\nSo we remove it.\n\n1278\n01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,180\nWe do what we think we should do.\n\n1279\n01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,260\nWe get rid of that data.\n\n1280\n01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,530\nWe clean up our website, or\nwhatever the case may be, but\n\n1281\n01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:20,440\nit's still out there, right?\n\n1282\n01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:24,580\nSo you've got to, in IT we've gotta think\n\n1283\n01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,725\nabout about where this information\nis going and, as Sean said,\n\n1284\n01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:31,885\na couple of times, once it gets out there\non the internet, it's very difficult,\n\n1285\n01:00:31,885 --> 01:00:34,345\nif not impossible,\njust to completely get rid of it.\n\n1286\n01:00:34,345 --> 01:00:34,935\n>> Yeah.\n\n1287\n01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:35,755\nAbsolutely.\n\n1288\n01:00:35,755 --> 01:00:38,555\nSo, always think ahead.\n\n1289\n01:00:38,555 --> 01:00:42,615\nOne of my personal things that I do is,\nand I saw friends go, what are you so\n\n1290\n01:00:42,615 --> 01:00:43,387\nparanoid about?\n\n1291\n01:00:43,387 --> 01:00:47,390\nIt's not, when I do certain\nthings on the information,\n\n1292\n01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,650\nit's not that I'm being paranoid about it.\n\n1293\n01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,050\nIt's that even if there's no reason for\n\n1294\n01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,770\nme to put information out there,\nI won't put that information out there.\n\n1295\n01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:58,450\nIt's not a question of that I\nthink someone's gonna use it.\n\n1296\n01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,800\nI'm just not gonna give\nanyone the chance to use it.\n\n1297\n01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,090\n>> Right\n>> So,\n\n1298\n01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,430\ndo I really need to put that out there?\n\n1299\n01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:05,090\nIf the answer is no, there's not a reason.\n\n1300\n01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,940\nIt doesn't go out there.\n\n1301\n01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:11,080\nSo it's just something to think about\nwhen you're doing these things.\n\n1302\n01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,580\nDo you really need to,\nis there a really good reason?\n\n1303\n01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:17,330\nAnd if there is, then think about\nhow that can be misused potentially.\n\n1304\n01:01:18,670 --> 01:01:19,290\nAlso, by the way,\n\n1305\n01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:23,820\nin answer to your question, what happens\nif you way back the Wayback Machine?\n\n1306\n01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,195\nThat's how you create black holes.\n\n1307\n01:01:25,195 --> 01:01:27,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stop it right now.\n\n1308\n01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,070\n>> That's good, yes.\n\n1309\n01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,120\nPlease don't create any black holes.\n\n1310\n01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,500\n>> Yeah, we don't need that.\n\n1311\n01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,980\nDon't go googling Google either.\n\n1312\n01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,700\nSame thing.\n\n1313\n01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,740\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, that's good, that's good.\n\n1314\n01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,550\nAll right, so in this episode we\ntook another look at footprinting.\n\n1315\n01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,130\nWe covered a lot of different tools that\nwe can use to gather that information in\n\n1316\n01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:47,950\nthe first phase of our attacking,\nof our hacking process.\n\n1317\n01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:52,570\nSo, remember if you guys have any\nquestions during the show, anytime you can\n\n1318\n01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:56,460\nget in that chatroom, you can type in\nyour questions, we monitor that live.\n\n1319\n01:01:56,460 -->

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:38,500\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,630\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n7\n00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:41,440\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Soriano.\n\n8\n00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,760\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n9\n00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,045\n>> I'm feeling great,\nready to punch security in the face.\n\n10\n00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:45,545\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n11\n00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,004\n>> All right, let's do it.\n\n12\n00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:49,605\nWe're gonna get our knuckles taped up and\n\n13\n00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:51,819\nwe're gonna get busy today.\nSo we're continuing on.\n\n14\n00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,219\nWe're still in Chapter Four,\n\n15\n00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,809\nif you're following along in Sean's\nfantastic book that CEH Study guide.\n\n16\n00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,590\nWe are talking about foot printing.\n\n17\n00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,280\nSo that's where we left off\nyesterday in our previous episode.\n\n18\n00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,830\nAnd we're continuing on\nwith our foot printing,\n\n19\n00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,630\ncuz it really is a lot to it, right?\n\n20\n00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,770\nThis is that first phase\nin that hacking process.\n\n21\n00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,086\nAnd it's where we spend a lot of our time.\n\n22\n00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:13,685\nThe more time we spend here, the easier\nthe rest of the phases are gonna be,\n\n23\n00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:17,286\ncuz we gather up all that information\nthat we can, most of it being publicly\n\n24\n00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:21,230\navailable and we're really not breaking\nany laws at this point, as long as we're\n\n25\n00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,990\nstaying with our passive footprinting, as\nwe talked about in our previous episode.\n\n26\n00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,690\nSo we're gonna just continue on that.\n\n27\n00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,860\nWe're gonna look at some\nmore tools that we can use.\n\n28\n00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,270\nOther avenues that we can go to\nget some additional information to\n\n29\n00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,570\nadd to what we've already collected\nabout our target organization.\n\n30\n00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,470\nSo I think today we're gonna actually\nstart off with talking about IP ranges and\n\n31\n00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,510\nthen we'll move on from there.\n\n32\n00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:45,200\nSo let's talk about IP ranges.\n\n33\n00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,510\nImportant stuff to get.\n\n34\n00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,830\nDefinitely makes it easier to find and\nstart working on your target, right?\n\n35\n00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,780\n>> Yes, it definitely does.\n\n36\n00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,150\nAnd you've gotta look at it in\nthe context of what we already have.\n\n37\n00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,170\nWe've previously looked\nat our web server data.\n\n38\n00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,270\n>> Right.\n>> And when we did that, and\n\n39\n00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:07,140\nwe did our who is info before that,\nwe were able to get some IP information.\n\n40\n00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,780\nBut, we don't have tons of it.\n\n41\n00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,570\nWe have enough to go after\nmaybe a mail server.\n\n42\n00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,710\nWe have enough to go after a web server.\n\n43\n00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,090\nBut, we could get more than that.\n\n44\n00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,934\n>> Yeah.\nWe saw like the way they were able to\n\n45\n00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:23,060\nretrieve their DNS server's name and\nmaybe, their DNS server addresses.\n\n46\n00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,590\nLike you said,\nby doing a couple of DNS look ups.\n\n47\n00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,040\nWhat have they made available publicly?\n\n48\n00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,590\nWe saw an MX record in there.\n\n49\n00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,740\nSome NS records so, we got a good start,\nbut we want more than that.\n\n50\n00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,290\n>> Yes, we need to find a way to get\na really closer look at our target.\n\n51\n00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,350\nAnd that's what it really is when\nyou have an IP address you're\n\n52\n00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,925\nsingling out a target there.\n\n53\n00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:46,560\nSo by getting an IP address and\nharvesting them.\n\n54\n00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,020\nIt gives us an idea of what\ntargets we may be dealing with.\n\n55\n00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,440\nAnd that's the important thing, maybe.\n\n56\n00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,400\nThe IP addresses we have so\nfar, presumably,\n\n57\n00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,650\ndo go to a web server or\ndo go to a mail server.\n\n58\n00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,920\nBut now we need to see if we\ncan get any additional ones.\n\n59\n00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,000\nAnd so, there are ways to do that.\n\n60\n00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,950\nAnd they're publicly available.\n\n61\n00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,440\n>> Right.\n>> It's a great thing, but so\n\n62\n00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,680\nagain, it's not illegal.\n\n63\n00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,792\nWe're not breaking any laws.\n\n64\n00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:14,330\nThis license stuff is put out there for\npeople to find.\n\n65\n00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,090\n>> Right, yeah, and so once we, because\nwe've got those single server addresses\n\n66\n00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,530\nbut what about the rest of the servers,\n\n67\n00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,030\nthe ones we didn't see returned\nin those results, right?\n\n68\n00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,480\nWe know they have other machines,\nother servers.\n\n69\n00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,580\nSo we'd really like to try to\nfind out maybe, not necessarily,\n\n70\n00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,190\nhis individual IP address, but\nlike what network blocker they're using.\n\n71\n00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,670\nSo we can start taking that\non into our next phase.\n\n72\n00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,070\nLet's see how we do that.\n\n73\n00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,900\nWhat are some tools or\n\n74\n00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,150\nwhere are some avenues we can go to\ntry to find their IP address ranges?\n\n75\n00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,920\n>> Well, what we have to talk about when\nwe're looking for IP address ranges, and\n\n76\n00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,840\nyou hit the nail on the head,\n\n77\n00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,820\nMike, is people have blocks of\nIP addresses that they lease.\n\n78\n00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,390\nSo that's what we want to look for.\n\n79\n00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,720\nAnd the question first of all is,\nwhere would we go to find that?\n\n80\n00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,880\nThat's not something you can\njust go anyplace to get.\n\n81\n00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,280\nYou have to go to specific places for it.\n\n82\n00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,650\nWell there's a series of registrars\nthat do have that information.\n\n83\n00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,850\nOnes like ARIN, here in the US.\n\n84\n00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,956\nThere's APNIC for Asia.\n\n85\n00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,887\nThere's LANIC for Latin America.\n\n86\n00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:15,545\nThere's AFRINIC for Africa.\n\n87\n00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,436\nSo, we have places we can go\nthat manage these things,\n\n88\n00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:23,420\nand have searchable data bases,\nas luck would have it.\n\n89\n00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,600\nThey have searchable databases that\nwe can get this information from.\n\n90\n00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,370\nSo that's where we're gonna go to.\n\n91\n00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,340\n>> Nice.\n>> And I'm gonna give you a little\n\n92\n00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,570\na little, wave a little red flag here.\n\n93\n00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,767\nI feel like I should have one\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:37,482\n>> Like, a sock and\n\n95\n00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:39,684\njust pull it out of my pocket and\nthrow it down.\n\n96\n00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:43,900\n>> Is that you do need to know those ones\nfor the exam as well as your pen testing.\n\n97\n00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,680\nThe last thing you wanna do, test aside is\n\n98\n00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,100\nbe somewhere on the face of this planet\nlooking for your IP arranges and\n\n99\n00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,250\ngoing well, I know it's supposed to\nbe there, but I'm not finding it.\n\n100\n00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,400\nYou might be looking in the wrong spot,\nand it happens.\n\n101\n00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,392\nSo just keep in that mind.\n\n102\n00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:06,370\nIf you're here in the US, you're\nprobably only going to ever go to ARON.\n\n103\n00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,850\nBut if you're someplace else,\n\n104\n00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,030\nyou may have to go learn\nthe other ones as the case may be.\n\n105\n00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,550\n>> Yeah, because in the end\nan organization needs IP addresses for\n\n106\n00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,010\ntheir publicly available devices.\n\n107\n00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:19,030\nWe can use NAT behind the scenes.\n\n108\n00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,480\nAnd they'd have to register us to\nmake sure that they are unique, and\n\n109\n00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,320\nthat nobody else is allowed to use\nthose once you've registered them.\n\n110\n00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,290\nSo it makes sense that\nsomebody is keeping track.\n\n111\n00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,570\nAnd that's what those registers are.\n\n112\n00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:31,779\nBut those are who we contact when we\nwanna buy a block of class C block or\n\n113\n00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,180\nsomething like that.\n\n114\n00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,350\nAnd so we'll take advantage of the fact\nthat somebody's keeping track of all that,\n\n115\n00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,430\nand we can see that information.\n\n116\n00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,600\nAnd there's definitely some ranges too.\n\n117\n00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,870\nMaybe in the show notes,\nwe can throw up some.\n\n118\n00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,080\nI remember a list that used to have of\ndo not scan these particular ranges.\n\n119\n00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,100\nIt was like Israeli governments.\n\n120\n00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,330\nThere are certain ones you\nreally don't want to mess with,\n\n121\n00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,430\nunless you want those scary black\nvans showing up in your driveway.\n\n122\n00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,330\n>> Yeah, that could turn out really\nbad for you, if you do that.\n\n123\n00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:05,339\nAnd let me tell you some stuff here\nsince you opened the door to that which\n\n124\n00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,932\nis great, is what did we talk about\nearlier on in the week we said,\n\n125\n00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:13,711\nyou know,\nnever scan anything without permission.\n\n126\n00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:17,240\nYeah, don't scan IP address without\npermission or anything without permission.\n\n127\n00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,810\nDon't poke around anything.\n\n128\n00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,030\nSo, if you obey that as a general rule,\nyou'll probably be okay.\n\n129\n00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,310\nYou'll probably stay out of those\nones that they say do not scan.\n\n130\n00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,585\nThe next thing that kind of builds onto\nthat is when you look up an IP range, and\n\n131\n00:06:34,585 --> 00:06:40,745\nyou're typing in a range to scan,\nthis is where your measure twice, cut once\n\n132\n00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:46,090\ncomes in, is that you double check that\nyou are scanning the right IP addresses.\n\n133\n00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,510\nYou may have got the correct one from\nthe stuff that I'm gonna show you.\n\n134\n00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,910\nBut if you happen to type something in,\nbecause you got a little tired or\n\n135\n00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:59,510\njust had fat fingers,\nas they sometimes say, that happens.\n\n136\n00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:03,375\nYou could scan the wrong one and\nthat may turn out bad for you.\n\n137\n00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:07,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is also where having a good\n\n138\n00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,270\nknowledge of TCP IP and subnetting\nranges and all that comes in too.\n\n139\n00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,870\n>> Absolutely.\n\n140\n00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,380\n>> Because it helps you interpret\nthem a little bit better.\n\n141\n00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,530\nAnd funny enough, you bring out\nthe black vans and everything, I do know\n\n142\n00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,100\nsomebody just as a kind of example,\npeople do watch this type of stuff.\n\n143\n00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,300\nAnd if you happen to scan the wrong\nIP address, in some cases that can be\n\n144\n00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,850\njust a landmine,\nyou're getting your step on.\n\n145\n00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:40,045\nI know an individual who was running\na vulnerability scan on a range of IPs.\n\n146\n00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:45,470\nAnd he messed up in the range he put in\nand he not only hit his range of IPs,\n\n147\n00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,460\nhe hit another range of IPs\nthat was owned by the NSA.\n\n148\n00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,418\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, he did.\n\n149\n00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,008\n>> Oops.\n[LAUGH]\n\n150\n00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,470\n>> Just in case you're wondering people,\n\n151\n00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,418\nthat's not a good thing.\n\n152\n00:07:55,418 --> 00:07:56,628\n>> No.\n\n153\n00:07:56,628 --> 00:07:59,580\n>> In his case what happened,\nhow long did it take?\n\n154\n00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,037\n>> It was less than an hour [LAUGH].\n\n155\n00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:05,634\nLess than an hour they had shut off\nthe whole company's internet access,\n\n156\n00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:07,280\nliterally shut it down.\n\n157\n00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,270\nAnd the ISP was like, what are you doing?\n\n158\n00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,570\nAnd they FBI agents show up going,\nwhat are doing?\n\n159\n00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,960\nAnd they had to have that discussion with\nthem and then they turned it back on, and\n\n160\n00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,370\nthey pretty much shook their finger\nat the guy going do it again and\n\n161\n00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,555\nthere's gonna be a problem.\n\n162\n00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:23,960\n>> Cuz those guys don't play either.\n\n163\n00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,870\nYou know, here in the US when they\nshow up it is like the movies I mean\n\n164\n00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,240\nthey typically show up in\nbulletproof vests and with weapons.\n\n165\n00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,300\nBecause they don't know what\nthey're coming in to see.\n\n166\n00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,370\n>> Yeah, they just don't know.\n\n167\n00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,750\n>> And they don't play.\n\n168\n00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,720\n>> It hasn't gotten tamer\non the response either.\n\n169\n00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,160\nAnd that can be true\nanywhere in the world.\n\n170\n00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,800\nIt's not a U.S. centric thing,\nwhere we're all paranoid or anything.\n\n171\n00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,640\nNo, it could happen anywhere, so\ntry to be careful when you, or to exercise\n\n172\n00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,490\na lot of caution, when you get IP ranges,\nwell, really anything, not just IP ranges.\n\n173\n00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,595\nMake sure you are interacting with\nthe stuff you want to interact with.\n\n174\n00:09:02,085 --> 00:09:06,545\nDon't [LAUGH] target something\nthat you shouldn't be.\n\n175\n00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,465\n>> Right.\n\n176\n00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,105\nYeah.\n\n177\n00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:08,815\nExactly.\n\n178\n00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:10,325\nSo be careful.\n\n179\n00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:12,400\nJust make sure you have permission.\n\n180\n00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,300\nDon't do anything you don't\nhave permission to do.\n\n181\n00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,560\nAll right, let's take a look at what\nwe can do with these registrars.\n\n182\n00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,700\n>> It's what we wanna take a look at here\nis where can you get that information?\n\n183\n00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,580\nWell, places you can get this information,\nthere's many of them.\n\n184\n00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,520\nYou can go to Aaron directly if\nyou can find it on their site.\n\n185\n00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Their site's\n\n186\n00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,280\na mess\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n187\n00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,824\n>> I'm just saying, you know, so\n\n188\n00:09:36,824 --> 00:09:38,710\nyou can do that.\n\n189\n00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,430\nYou can also use web sites like this.\n\n190\n00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,980\nThis is itools.com.\n\n191\n00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,640\nThis is actually a really\ncool site by the way.\n\n192\n00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,620\nI've only shown a little bit of it,\nbut if you go to itools.com,\n\n193\n00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,340\ntheir homepage, which this isn't it.\n\n194\n00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,970\nTheir homepage will\nshow a lot of tools for\n\n195\n00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,000\nDNS stuff or a whole bunch of\nthings that are very, very useful.\n\n196\n00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,745\nSo if you're playing along at home,\n\n197\n00:10:03,745 --> 00:10:09,430\nthen this might be a website\nyou want to bookmark.\n\n198\n00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,250\nBecause there are other\nthings that are useful for\n\n199\n00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,930\nyou doing your footprinting process.\n\n200\n00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,800\nA lot about it we've already talked about.\n\n201\n00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,540\nHere's just one other place for that.\n\n202\n00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,900\nIn this case,\nI'm just using the one tool on it.\n\n203\n00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,460\nSo I am looking up IP addresses and\nif you're doing this,\n\n204\n00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,180\nI go IP addresses and I go to the air and\nsearch which you see here.\n\n205\n00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,800\nAnd what I need to do is\ntype in an IP address.\n\n206\n00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,180\nThis one also does\naccept a name like this.\n\n207\n00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,000\nIf you do look up, it will bring back\na record and you'll see it initially and\n\n208\n00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,540\nit doesn't look like much, that's\nwhy there's a scroll bar over there.\n\n209\n00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,510\nYou gotta scroll down.\n\n210\n00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,780\nIf you scroll down in here, I mean\nobviously Microsoft has a lot going on,\n\n211\n00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,120\nso you see a lot of IP ranges\nright here showing you\n\n212\n00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,100\nthe different ranges that\nare leased by Microsoft.\n\n213\n00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,900\nYou know these are all public IPs that\nyou could potentially find resources on.\n\n214\n00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,040\nI think that's actually a good\nopening to mention something on.\n\n215\n00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,010\nJust because your finding\na range of IPs does\n\n216\n00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,710\nnot mean something's living\nbehind each one of those.\n\n217\n00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,440\nYou know.\nNow we're gonna talk about that more when\n\n218\n00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,180\nwe get into our next phase for\nscanning, but\n\n219\n00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,280\nremember just because you're looking at\nthis doesn't mean you hit the gold mine.\n\n220\n00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,400\nYou're like, wow, look at all this stuff,\nyou know, those are all\n\n221\n00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,395\nsystems attached to the Internet behind\nevery one of those IP addresses.\n\n222\n00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:34,955\nIt absolutely does not mean that.\n\n223\n00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:37,575\n>> Right.\n>> It means that something could be\n\n224\n00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:38,465\nattached behind that.\n\n225\n00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:43,010\nThere is a potential all these\nslots that something could live in,\n\n226\n00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,570\nbut we don't know yet.\n\n227\n00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,320\nWe have to employ other\ntechniques that we have yet\n\n228\n00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,930\nto see that can tell us if there\nis something back there or not.\n\n229\n00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,210\n>> So we're still in\nthe information gathering phase.\n\n230\n00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,410\nWe really don't know how good\nthat information is yet.\n\n231\n00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,850\nWe're just trying to get as much as we\ncan, because remember that information is\n\n232\n00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,230\ngonna be the input for\nthe next phase of our process.\n\n233\n00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,330\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n234\n00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,180\nSo do remember that.\n\n235\n00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,160\nWe're at that point, we're still out here.\n\n236\n00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,670\nWe're trying to narrow it down.\n\n237\n00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,930\nSo we've got this and\n\n238\n00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,850\nnow we gotta find out where there\nmight be machines living behind that.\n\n239\n00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,770\nSo we haven't done that yet.\n\n240\n00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,880\nDoesn't mean this\ninformation isn't useful.\n\n241\n00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,480\nIt definitely is useful.\n\n242\n00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,490\nIt's just stuff that we have to note and\ncarry on into our next phase.\n\n243\n00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,010\n>> Very good.\n\n244\n00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:27,810\nSo, we can go out there and\n\n245\n00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,120\nwe can get some block of addresses on\nthese guys using the different registrars.\n\n246\n00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,900\nAnd as Sean mentioned, there's\ndifferent registrars for the different-\n\n247\n00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,060\nIt's divided up globally, whether it's six\nor seven, I think, or something like that.\n\n248\n00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,880\n>> Yeah, it's about five.\n\n249\n00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,140\n>> Five to seven of these\ndifferent registrars.\n\n250\n00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:45,212\nSo you might have to go to a different\none if your target is in a different\n\n251\n00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:49,455\ncountry or different part of the world,\nyou maybe go to a different registrar\n\n252\n00:12:49,455 --> 00:12:52,725\nto find information on\ntheir particular ranges.\n\n253\n00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,875\n>> Yeah, so if you have a range,\nif you're looking for a company or\n\n254\n00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,135\nsomething that doesn't show up, or\nyou kind of question the information that\n\n255\n00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:04,260\nyou're getting,\nmaybe you're not in the registrar.\n\n256\n00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,150\nSo maybe it's time to switch over\nto one of the other ones to see if\n\n257\n00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:09,960\nthey have that.\n\n258\n00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,320\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n259\n00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,590\nIt's not an uncommon mistake to make.\n\n260\n00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,820\n>> All right, so that's itools.com,\ngives us those IP address ranges.\n\n261\n00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,680\nOnce we start...\n\n262\n00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,480\nWe're still in the foot printing phase,\nwe're not moving into our next phase yet.\n\n263\n00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,390\nSo what else can we do with IP addresses?\n\n264\n00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,380\n>> Well, we've got that part with IP\naddresses, but the next thing we can do to\n\n265\n00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:41,740\nstart playing around with IP addresses is\nwe can do things to start seeing if we can\n\n266\n00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,790\nmap out things between us and those IP\naddresses, or those sites and locations.\n\n267\n00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,470\nOne tool we have for\ndoing that is traceroute.\n\n268\n00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,410\nAnd the thing interesting\nabout traceroute is,\n\n269\n00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,340\nI can bring up my command\nprompt here on my system.\n\n270\n00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:02,150\nTraceroute, I'm guessing\nthere's probably a good\n\n271\n00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,320\nnumber of you that\nalready know traceroute.\n\n272\n00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,930\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's a pretty standard utility.\n\n273\n00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:14,060\nSo I can type in traceroute and I can\nput an IP address to a domain name and\n\n274\n00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,340\nI'm feeling lazy so I'm going to put-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n275\n00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,520\n>> in a domain name.\n\n276\n00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,090\nSo you can put in something\nlike microsoft.com.\n\n277\n00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,092\nAnd hit Enter, and\nyou will see that it's just\n\n278\n00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:32,450\ntelling us what's between us and\nthem, okay.\n\n279\n00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,480\nThere's nothing, really no frills or\nanything with this.\n\n280\n00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,270\n>> Right.\n>> It's pretty\n\n281\n00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,567\nmuch blunt with what it reveals.\n\n282\n00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:43,890\nYou can see what it takes it to go from\nus to go to that point, such as it is,\n\n283\n00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,840\nand bang, there you go.\n\n284\n00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,280\nIt gives you the idea of what's happening.\n\n285\n00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,400\nWhat path it can take.\n\n286\n00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,520\nMaybe tell us what's in\nthe same vicinity sometimes.\n\n287\n00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,070\nThis is good to use, but, sometimes people\ndon't like to use something like that.\n\n288\n00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:02,220\nThey want to use traceroute, but\nthey don't like to know the command line.\n\n289\n00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,175\nI'm gonna tell you,\nyou gotta always know the command line.\n\n290\n00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:06,836\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You just have to know that.\n\n291\n00:15:06,836 --> 00:15:13,470\nBut if you really, really have\nthe subversion to using the command line.\n\n292\n00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,500\nOnce you already know how to use it and\nwhat's going on,\n\n293\n00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,190\nyou can go to something like\nvisual traceroute here.\n\n294\n00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,050\nVisual traceroute,\nyou can do the same thing.\n\n295\n00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,750\nYou can type in, you know, an address in\nhere, and tell it where you want it to go,\n\n296\n00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,120\nand hit trace.\n\n297\n00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,170\nAnd it will run a quick trace on that and\ntell you\n\n298\n00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,020\nwhat it finds and we're gonna see pretty\nmuch the same type of information.\n\n299\n00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,390\nYou can see the IP addresses down here at\nthe bottom, and you can hover on them and\n\n300\n00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,980\ntell where they actually are.\n\n301\n00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,380\nSo it's kinda neat, you know.\n\n302\n00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,420\n>> Oh, it's definitely fun.\n\n303\n00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420\nYeah, it's a lot more exciting\nthan the command line.\n\n304\n00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,548\nI mean, you're getting a lot of the same\ninformation without the map And\n\n305\n00:15:54,548 --> 00:15:56,650\nthings like that, and\nwe mentioned yesterday,\n\n306\n00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,883\nthese are tools that you probably\nare familiar with already if you've done\n\n307\n00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:03,760\nany kind of network administration, or\nare studying to become a network admin.\n\n308\n00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,580\nThis is another one of\nthose tools that we use for\n\n309\n00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,590\ntroubleshooting, right, for\ntroubleshooting, right?\n\n310\n00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,915\nFor troubleshooting our network,\ncuz it shows us each hop that the path,\n\n311\n00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,835\nthat the package is going to on that path.\n\n312\n00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:15,145\nSo we can figure out which one of\nour routers in our internal network,\n\n313\n00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:17,735\nmaybe is holding onto\nthose packets too long.\n\n314\n00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:20,205\nIf we're having connectivity\nissues with an outside resource,\n\n315\n00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:23,020\nwe can try to figure out where\nthat connectivity is stopping.\n\n316\n00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,080\nBut from the actors point of view,\nthis can be some really good information.\n\n317\n00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,180\nYou're getting information about,\n\n318\n00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,130\nespecially those hops towards the end,\nright?\n\n319\n00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,920\nBecause now you're getting close to their\nnetwork and you can see what routers\n\n320\n00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,460\nyou're hitting on the way in, and\nyou're going to hit their border routers.\n\n321\n00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,230\nAnd things like that, and I know Michael\nout there in the chatroom was just asking,\n\n322\n00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,580\nright before you pulled that up, he\nsaid is visual trace route still around?\n\n323\n00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,520\nAnd sure enough, that's\nthe Visual Route 2010 business edition,\n\n324\n00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,710\nso there you go, and it does, we were\ntalking about that before the episode.\n\n325\n00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,260\nIt does make it seem like the movies,\nright?\n\n326\n00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,560\nBecause that's what you always see.\n\n327\n00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,520\nThey're trying to trace where this\nattack's coming from and you see\n\n328\n00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,790\nit pinging around the world and things\nlike that, so very cool tool, very cool.\n\n329\n00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,700\n>> Movie?\nDo you I need to get my sunglasses now\n\n330\n00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,275\nor something?\n\n331\n00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,325\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I know Kung Fu.\n\n332\n00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:13,051\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n333\n00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:16,740\nBut the thing is like this.\n\n334\n00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,240\nNo matter which one you use,\n\n335\n00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,222\nyou know, you do have to\nunderstand how traceroute works.\n\n336\n00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:24,912\nA lot of you probably\nhave used it already,\n\n337\n00:17:24,912 --> 00:17:29,170\ntypical network troubleshooting tool.\n\n338\n00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,120\nJust the quick review on it,\n\n339\n00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,610\nto understand what's going on here\nwhen you see something like this.\n\n340\n00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,900\nIt's good information,\nas you may or may not already know.\n\n341\n00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,060\nWhen you use something like a trace route,\n\n342\n00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:47,200\nwhat it does, its saying to pack it out\nand keeps increasing the TTL value on it.\n\n343\n00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,470\nSo it starts with one, and that one's\ngonna go out to the first point.\n\n344\n00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,400\nAnd that first point will\nsubtract one from the TTL, and\n\n345\n00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,380\nit goes to zero and it's dead.\n\n346\n00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,020\nThen it goes to two, and it hits\nthe first one, and then the second one.\n\n347\n00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,400\nAnd each one of those hops,\nIt removes one from the TTL.\n\n348\n00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,410\nWhen hits zero, it's dead,\nit won't go any further.\n\n349\n00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,948\nAnd so it keeps doing that, increasing\nthat, and it goes out further, and\n\n350\n00:18:09,948 --> 00:18:14,040\nfurther, and further,\nuntil it either gets to the limit of\n\n351\n00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,350\nhow far it's going to go out, or it\nactually does hit that final destination.\n\n352\n00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,500\nAnd so, no matter which traceroute tool\nyou go to, it's doing the same thing.\n\n353\n00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,260\nSo as long as you understand that and,\nlike I said,\n\n354\n00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,770\nunderstand how to use the command line.\n\n355\n00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,710\nWhich more than likely if you're a betting\nman, you're gonna look at which one\n\n356\n00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,270\nthe people are gonna be using,\nthey're gonna be using the command line.\n\n357\n00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:43,390\nJust about everyone uses the command\nline at some point in their career.\n\n358\n00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,810\nSo, if that's the case.\n\n359\n00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,640\nSince that's the case,\nyou could stick with that.\n\n360\n00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,400\nIf you wanna use something like\nVisual Trace Route, go ahead.\n\n361\n00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400\nI would caution you however, when you look\nat something like Visual Trace Route,\n\n362\n00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,500\nyou can see on my screen\nas a matter of fact.\n\n363\n00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,700\nYou can see, and let me kind of\nmove some of this out of the way.\n\n364\n00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,680\nYou might get tempted to kind\nof look at this and see, okay,\n\n365\n00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,000\nyou've got this map in here.\n\n366\n00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,310\nWell, that must be,\nif I hover over this map and\n\n367\n00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,610\nit's telling me all this,\nthat must be where those things are.\n\n368\n00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840\nIt doesn't mean that at all.\n\n369\n00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,143\nDon't look at that map and\nautomatically assume that, oh,\n\n370\n00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:21,076\nthat IP address trace it to\nsomething in that region.\n\n371\n00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,253\nIt's not like the movies.\n\n372\n00:19:22,253 --> 00:19:25,983\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm sorry to break anybody's bubble,\n\n373\n00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:29,535\nbut there but if you,\njust because it says it's in the area,\n\n374\n00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,120\ndoesn't mean it's in that area.\n\n375\n00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,524\nThe way things are set up nowadays,\nis an ip address could,\n\n376\n00:19:35,524 --> 00:19:37,442\nis just literally an ip address.\n\n377\n00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:41,180\nIt doesn't mean anything\nto do with location.\n\n378\n00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,400\nYou know,\nI can tell you just one example of this,\n\n379\n00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,760\nand I'm sure a lot of you are familiar\nwith it is, heck, one of the times I\n\n380\n00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:54,280\nwas in Vegas I pulled up an IP address\nthere and it said I was in Arizona.\n\n381\n00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,360\n>> Right.\n>> Clearly I wasn't Arizona.\n\n382\n00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:02,100\nThe ISP was actually coming out In\nthat area, so don't take it as that.\n\n383\n00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,655\nDon't get tempted to look at\na visual trace route and say,\n\n384\n00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:09,570\noh well that's exactly where it is,\nand send the swat teams out.\n\n385\n00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,825\nYou know who you are.\n\n386\n00:20:10,825 --> 00:20:13,360\n[LAUGH] So it's definitely not,\nit's definitely not that.\n\n387\n00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,680\n>> Yeah it really is\njust a bit of the puzzle.\n\n388\n00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,860\nRight?\nIs it we need more information to confirm.\n\n389\n00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,910\nLike I think yesterday in another episode,\n\n390\n00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,450\nyou talk about confirming\nthe information that you get.\n\n391\n00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,490\nYou don't trust just that one source.\n\n392\n00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,000\nIt's getting all of it.\n\n393\n00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,810\nAnd then making a good\ndecision based on everything.\n\n394\n00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,980\nWe've probably all had the experience.\n\n395\n00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,210\nI know if I log in right now,\nand I go to Home Depot, and\n\n396\n00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,480\nit's going to try to pick my store right,\nand it's going to say Atlanta, GA.\n\n397\n00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,940\nI'm hundreds of miles from Atlanta, GA.\n\n398\n00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,180\nSo just because of the fact, the way\nthey deal with the IP addresses and\n\n399\n00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,050\nshare these ranges between ISP.\n\n400\n00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,290\nThese and things like that,\nthat it's not complete.\n\n401\n00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,370\nIt's not always 100% accurate.\n\n402\n00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:56,540\n>> Absolutely, so do you kinda follow that\nway in the gray matter that, you know,\n\n403\n00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,980\nit's not necessarily the case where an IP\naddress is specifically in that area.\n\n404\n00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:06,960\nSo, focus more on the IP\naddresses you're getting, and\n\n405\n00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,940\nwhat's coming back from them,\nrather than the geographic location.\n\n406\n00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,580\nIt looks nice, looks pretty, you know,\n\n407\n00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,900\nsome of that doesn't know what\nwe're just trying to get across.\n\n408\n00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,125\nMight look at it going,\nwell that's pretty awesome, you know.\n\n409\n00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,940\n[LAUGH] Fine, if they don't\nknow any better, impress them,\n\n410\n00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:23,450\ngoing, oh well yeah,\nclearly it's going to these regions.\n\n411\n00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,338\nYou know, but for\nus we need to know that, yes,\n\n412\n00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,392\nit doesn't exactly mean\na geographic location.\n\n413\n00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:30,796\n>> Right.\nI think David said in the chat\n\n414\n00:21:30,796 --> 00:21:33,844\nroom earlier, you know,\nthat he prefers the command line, but\n\n415\n00:21:33,844 --> 00:21:36,900\nthe GUI is impressive for\nmaybe a report or something like that.\n\n416\n00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,270\nSo, like you were saying.\n\n417\n00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,420\nYou might want to impress the guy that you\nare trying to get him to sign you on as\n\n418\n00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,020\na pin tester for the company,\nor something like that.\n\n419\n00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,060\nYou say, look at these cool tools I have.\n\n420\n00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,610\nMight impress the big wigs out there,\nwith the pretty maps and things.\n\n421\n00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,958\nBut we know the command line is where\nwe're going to get the bulk of our\n\n422\n00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:53,724\ninformation.\n\n423\n00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:56,128\n>> Yeah, and like what's said for\na long time,\n\n424\n00:21:56,128 --> 00:22:00,390\nthere's something cool about doing\nsomething with the command line, right?\n\n425\n00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,682\n>> It makes you feel powerful.\n\n426\n00:22:01,682 --> 00:22:02,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n427\n00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,360\n>> I don't think there's a single pen test\n\n428\n00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,200\nor hack, or whatever, out there that\ndoesn't, even though there's these\n\n429\n00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,990\nGUI tools available, that won't go\nthrough and do stuff at the command line.\n\n430\n00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,400\nSay look, clearly.\n\n431\n00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,780\nThere's something satisfying about that.\n\n432\n00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,185\nI don't know why, but there is.\n\n433\n00:22:17,185 --> 00:22:18,140\n[LAUGH]\n>> And I can change my\n\n434\n00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,370\nfont color in the command line.\n\n435\n00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,762\n>> Yeah, change font colors.\n\n436\n00:22:20,762 --> 00:22:23,370\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n437\n00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,330\nwe got our, as far as our different\ntools go we've got trace route.\n\n438\n00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:27,930\nGreat one.\n\n439\n00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,460\nWe've got the command\nline version of that.\n\n440\n00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,540\nWhich is definitely more portable,\nand things like that,\n\n441\n00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,180\nwe'll talk about that in\nsome of our later phases.\n\n442\n00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,050\nBut you get the GUI versions as well.\n\n443\n00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,420\nAnother one that again we\nare probably familiar with just from\n\n444\n00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,990\nour server training, is pathpay.\n\n445\n00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,180\n>> Yeah,\nthat's one that is available to us.\n\n446\n00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,140\nAnd it's actually kind of interesting one.\n\n447\n00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,800\nI don't know about you, Mike,\nfrom your classes when you do it, but\n\n448\n00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,380\nI have found there's still quite a few\npeople that they know traceroute, and\n\n449\n00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,920\nthey know ping, but\nPathPing's like, whoa, hold on.\n\n450\n00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,990\nWhat did you say?\n\n451\n00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,950\nIt's still kind of unusual thing.\n\n452\n00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,530\nYeah, so I felt it something to\njust in the interest of being\n\n453\n00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,790\na completist here, is showing path ping.\n\n454\n00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:16,340\nPath ping, you know, there's a reason\nwhy I just said about using trace route\n\n455\n00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:22,050\nand ping is that trace route,\nwe know what that does.\n\n456\n00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,980\nPing, very easy, we know what that one\ndoes, just bounces something off a remote.\n\n457\n00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,740\nWell, what pathing does,\nis pathing goes and\n\n458\n00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,670\ncombines the functionality of both,\nreally.\n\n459\n00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:35,540\nSo, if you know you're gonna\nrunning one and then the other,\n\n460\n00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:40,540\nwhich is likely in a lot of cases,\nmight as well just do it all at once.\n\n461\n00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,010\nSo you can do something like this.\n\n462\n00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,580\nYou're kinda seeing it,\nit's taking a little bit of time here.\n\n463\n00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,680\nI won't wait for the full three minutes,\nwe don't have to do that.\n\n464\n00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,450\nBut it's something that you can try out.\n\n465\n00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:55,007\nIt's gonna do the traceroute,\nthen it's gonna give you the ping and\n\n466\n00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:57,590\nthe response times and\nsay, this is what I found.\n\n467\n00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,630\nSo do try it out.\n\n468\n00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,596\nIt's not something that people who\nare taking the exam are gonna have to\n\n469\n00:24:04,596 --> 00:24:05,600\nworry about.\n\n470\n00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,660\nBecause they stick with the old standbys,\nputting in trace route.\n\n471\n00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,710\nBut, I think in the interest\nof saving you time.\n\n472\n00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,726\nBecause even though I say be patient,\nyou don't wanna go through and\n\n473\n00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,188\njust waste time unnecessarily.\n\n474\n00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:17,990\n>> Right.\n\n475\n00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,920\n>> So always have little shortcuts.\n\n476\n00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,990\nThis is a shortcut.\n\n477\n00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:22,810\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n478\n00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,400\nIt's a pretty cool tool\nlike Shawn was saying.\n\n479\n00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,770\nIt combines really the results we\nget from trace routing and ping.\n\n480\n00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,060\nTakes a little longer cuz\nit's really doing where is,\n\n481\n00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,300\nas we're talking about trace routing.\n\n482\n00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,670\nIt's sending out one packet and\njust incrementing that TTL so\n\n483\n00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:37,650\nwe can get to the next hop, and\nthe next hop, and the next hop.\n\n484\n00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,350\nWhere as pathing is sending\na multitude of packets.\n\n485\n00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,967\nAnd it's really looking at an average\nof the statistics on each one of those,\n\n486\n00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,620\nthat's why it takes so\nlong to compile that data.\n\n487\n00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,190\nIt's not sending just one,\nit's sending many to that first hop, and\n\n488\n00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,670\nthen many to that second hop, and giving\nus kind of an average of the results.\n\n489\n00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,750\nThat's great information, and\nworth the wait, typically.\n\n490\n00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,330\n>> Yeah, and\nalso remember something else in this too.\n\n491\n00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,540\nThis is a Microsoft thing.\n\n492\n00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,950\nIt's not something that you're\ngonna see on Linux or Unix.\n\n493\n00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,660\nI mean, I believe they have equivalent\ntools if I recall, but this is something,\n\n494\n00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,450\npathing is a Microsoftism.\n\n495\n00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:16,390\nBut most of us are gonna be working\nin Windows for the bulk of our stuff.\n\n496\n00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,530\n>> At least have access\nto a Windows machine.\n\n497\n00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,520\nAs a good pin tester or\nyou know we're gonna have\n\n498\n00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,610\nmore than one operating system depending\non the tools we're trying to use.\n\n499\n00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,370\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n500\n00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:31,388\nYou've gotta be, you know,\nmulti-operating system fluent.\n\n501\n00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:32,490\n>> Very good.\n\n502\n00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,050\nAll right, well that takes care of our\ntrace route and our IP address ranges.\n\n503\n00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,230\nAnything else we wanna add into that?\n\n504\n00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,960\n>> I think we've hit what we need to hear.\n\n505\n00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,925\nWhat I want to focus,\nthis particular show on was,\n\n506\n00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:52,013\nhow to get these ranges of IP's and\nwhere that kind of relates in?\n\n507\n00:25:52,013 --> 00:25:55,670\nSo we tied it in back to\nthe web server stuff.\n\n508\n00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,980\nWhere we had just an IP address here,\nthere, one for a mail server.\n\n509\n00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,090\nAnd now we're building that\nout to get a range of them.\n\n510\n00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:08,110\nTo get a range of potential targets,\nso we have definitely done that.\n\n511\n00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,950\nAnd then we also found ways to do a trace\n\n512\n00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:18,340\nA route to those specific IP address,\nso we've done that as well.\n\n513\n00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:22,130\nSo those are the big what I wanted to show\nsome stuff we could do with IP addresses,\n\n514\n00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:24,672\nat least at this stage, for footprinting.\n\n515\n00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,640\n>> Very good.\n\n516\n00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,920\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat is probably a good point for\n\n517\n00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,270\nus to go ahead and take our break,\nso we're gonna stop here.\n\n518\n00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:36,025\nWhen we come back, we're gonna dive\ninto the world of social networking and\n\n519\n00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:40,305\nsee what kind of juicy information we\ncan glean from those different sites.\n\n520\n00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:42,258\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back in a moment.\n\n521\n00:26:42,258 --> 00:26:48,806\n[MUSIC]\n\n522\n00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:50,850\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n523\n00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,670\nContinuing on with our Footprinting we are\ngonna now dive into the world of social\n\n524\n00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:59,880\nnetworking, and see what kind of\ninformation is available out there.\n\n525\n00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,585\nAnd, as you're probably well aware,\nit's a surprisingly large amount.\n\n526\n00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,050\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Well, maybe not so surprisingly,\n\n527\n00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:08,030\nright, it's tons of\ninformation that we gather.\n\n528\n00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,650\nIf we know where to look and\nwhat to look for.\n\n529\n00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,570\n>> Yeah,\nthere really is a whole lot out there with\n\n530\n00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,720\nsocial networking or social media,\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n531\n00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,340\nThere's a treasure trove\nof things out there,\n\n532\n00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,570\nthe question is how do we get\naccess to it because this stuff is\n\n533\n00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,150\nscattered over so many different\nnetworks and so many different things.\n\n534\n00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,420\nHow do you actually bring it together?\n\n535\n00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,040\nWell.\n\n536\n00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,372\n>> And I guess before we dive into\nit too far, I do want to mention,\n\n537\n00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:39,352\ncuz somebody had a question earlier,\ntalked about,\n\n538\n00:27:39,352 --> 00:27:42,580\nwe see social engineering here, and then\nwe're gonna see social engineering again.\n\n539\n00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,650\nWe've got our own chapter on social\nengineering, and I just want to make sure.\n\n540\n00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,480\nI think I said, during the off time, and\njust make sure you can confirm that.\n\n541\n00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,870\nWe see the social engineering\ncoming back in different phases,\n\n542\n00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,710\ndepending on what we're trying to do,\nright.\n\n543\n00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,570\nIn this phase, in the footprinting phase,\n\n544\n00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:04,290\nwe're using social engineering to gather\ninformation about our potential targets.\n\n545\n00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:07,790\nLater on, we could see social\nengineering come back and\n\n546\n00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,780\nact as an attack factor, right.\n\n547\n00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,010\nAnd the same thing with some\nof these social networkings.\n\n548\n00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,270\n>> Yeah, in fact kind of clarify.\n\n549\n00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:19,480\nBecause this is a good sticking point.\n\n550\n00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,830\nIs that you hear that term social a lot.\n\n551\n00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,050\nSocial engineering, social networking.\n\n552\n00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:27,780\nRight now we are focusing on\nthe social networking part.\n\n553\n00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,070\nJust gathering information.\n\n554\n00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,700\nThe social engineering tends\nto be a little more active and\n\n555\n00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,610\naggressive way of gathering information.\n\n556\n00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,120\nYou're actually manipulating human\nhabit and trust and patterns and\n\n557\n00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,170\nstuff like that to get a result.\n\n558\n00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,470\nSocial networking,\nthey've already put that out there.\n\n559\n00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,120\nWe're just finding, going out there and\n\n560\n00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,660\nlooking at it to see what information\nwe can glean from what's out there.\n\n561\n00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,370\nSo, there's a bit of a difference,\nand it's a good thing to bring up,\n\n562\n00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,430\nbecause there is questions about that.\n\n563\n00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:01,550\nBut it's also true to say that social\nengineering is a topic that we\n\n564\n00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,700\nwill have our own episode dedicated to.\n\n565\n00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,220\nLater on down the road.\n\n566\n00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,602\nBut yeah,\nit does peak out in a lot of areas.\n\n567\n00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:14,760\nYou're gonna mix the different styles and\ntechniques and things we're doing.\n\n568\n00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,240\nYou're gonna mix them all over the place.\n\n569\n00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,120\nIt's a question of, what's most\nappropriate at that time to use.\n\n570\n00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:28,590\nIs it appropriate to use technical\nmechanism to gather information, do that.\n\n571\n00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:33,770\nIf it's better to talk to someone and\ninteract with\n\n572\n00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:38,370\nthem through email or instant messaging or\nwhatever to get information, do that.\n\n573\n00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,010\nThat's something that does\ncome with experience,\n\n574\n00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,920\nthat's why you really gotta practice\nall these things and get used to.\n\n575\n00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,300\nOkay, I can get this information from\nhere and this information from here and\n\n576\n00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,920\nI can put it all together.\n\n577\n00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,040\nAnd once you get good enough at some of\nthese areas I mean social engineering for\n\n578\n00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,960\nexample, you get good enough at that\n\n579\n00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,845\nit's like pulling the Jedi\nmind trick on people.\n\n580\n00:30:01,845 --> 00:30:02,900\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n581\n00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,520\n>> And I've seen people who are like that.\n\n582\n00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:07,950\nIt's like Dude, I think the guy just,\nhe's a Jedi man, I saw it and\n\n583\n00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,430\nI still don't believe it.\n\n584\n00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,190\nSo.\n\n585\n00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,524\n>> These are not the droids\nyou're looking for.\n\n586\n00:30:11,524 --> 00:30:13,856\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n587\n00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:17,760\n>> All right, so social networking,\nsocial media, lots.\n\n588\n00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,370\nAnd we're all familiar with\nthe different ones, right?\n\n589\n00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,170\nTwitter, Facebook, I don't even know,\nis MySpace still out there?\n\n590\n00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:25,710\n>> It is.\n\n591\n00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,410\n>> It is still out there, so I'm not\nthe big social media kind of guy, but so\n\n592\n00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,460\nmany people are.\n\n593\n00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,705\n>> What, there's people like you still?\n\n594\n00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:34,858\n>> [LAUGH] I know right.\n\n595\n00:30:34,858 --> 00:30:38,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, I belong to all of them.\n\n596\n00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,500\nBecause information gathering, right?\n\n597\n00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,977\nI mean, I can keep up with what's going on\nand see crazy things people are posting\n\n598\n00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,600\nand so let's see how we can use\nit in our footprinting phase.\n\n599\n00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,660\nSo where we wanna start?\n\n600\n00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,030\nWhat's the first social media\nplace we want to go to?\n\n601\n00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,620\n>> Well,\nlet's talk about the different social\n\n602\n00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,390\nnetworks that are out there\nthat might be of use.\n\n603\n00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,860\nAnd really all of them are of use, but\n\n604\n00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,180\nyou're bringing up Twitter,\nFacebook, MySpace.\n\n605\n00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,400\nThere's other ones out there.\n\n606\n00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,740\nLinkedIn's another great one.\n\n607\n00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,380\nLinkedIn is actually a very\ngood treasure trove because\n\n608\n00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,240\nthat you are doing specifically for\nbusiness reasons.\n\n609\n00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,480\nYou're not doing it to talk about hey I\ntook my dog down to the river nowadays or\n\n610\n00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,440\ntoday, no.\n\n611\n00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,830\nYou're talking about skills you have and\n\n612\n00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,010\nstuff like that so you can start\ntracing people back to a company.\n\n613\n00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,300\nI mean, heck, who knows?\n\n614\n00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,220\nMaybe in the early part of footprinting,\n\n615\n00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,300\nyou've found that company\ndirectory of people.\n\n616\n00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,200\nAnd you start looking up\nthe cross-reference them with LinkedIn.\n\n617\n00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,320\nSo that would be a good thing.\n\n618\n00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,891\nBut you look at some of the other ones,\nthings like Twitter, it does store\n\n619\n00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:49,080\ngeographic information, which is something\nthat I will show you how to retrieve.\n\n620\n00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:53,553\nYou know, Facebook, people are very\nchatty on Facebook and don't tend to\n\n621\n00:31:53,553 --> 00:31:57,755\nthink about what they're posting until\nafter they let it out of the bag\n\n622\n00:31:57,755 --> 00:31:58,835\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n623\n00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,812\n>> And not to mention Facebook with their\n\n624\n00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:03,902\nchanging privacy settings,\nit's also a bit difficult for\n\n625\n00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:05,770\npeople to keep their stuff secret.\n\n626\n00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,730\nAnd that other one that's out there,\nMySpace, I know some of you are kind\n\n627\n00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:15,020\nof looking, hearing MySpace and going\n>> Really?\n\n628\n00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:18,035\nFor those of you younger,\nMySpace was a older social network\n\n629\n00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:20,630\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n630\n00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,490\nMySpace, that's something I kind\nof like to throw out there.\n\n631\n00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,430\nBecause we can make jokes about MySpace,\ngoing oh,\n\n632\n00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,020\nthere was MySpace, now there's Facebook\nand everyone's forgotten about it.\n\n633\n00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,760\nMySpace is still out there but\n\n634\n00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,150\nlet me kind of factor something in here\nwith, when you're talking about MySpace.\n\n635\n00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,600\nMySpace, that was where a lot of people\ncut their teeth on social networking.\n\n636\n00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,080\nThat's where they first kind of\ndipped their toes in the water\n\n637\n00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,480\nof this new world of shared\ninformation through social networking.\n\n638\n00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,160\nNow, the thing is, is that people at the\ntime they were using MySpace, they were, I\n\n639\n00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:59,260\nmean how many times did you hear security\nmentioned in the same breath as Myspace.\n\n640\n00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:03,270\nIt's usually just we're doing social\nnetworking, have you checked Myspace?\n\n641\n00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,362\nThey weren't worried about how\nto share that information.\n\n642\n00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:10,600\nBut then, Facebook got big and\nthey migrated over there.\n\n643\n00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,340\nNow think about what happened when they\nmigrated from Myspace over to Facebook.\n\n644\n00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,450\nHey, what if everyone's on Facebook.\n\n645\n00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:20,620\nI'm gonna go over to Facebook and their\nMySpace account kinda sat there idle.\n\n646\n00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,900\nIt got used less and less.\n\n647\n00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,330\nAnd then it's idle and\nit may still be out there.\n\n648\n00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,500\n>> Gonna say they don't go back and\ndelete their account or\n\n649\n00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,670\nremove any of that information.\n\n650\n00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,970\nYou just don't think about it anymore.\n\n651\n00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,140\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n652\n00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,520\nAnd I might find information\nfrom a previous life.\n\n653\n00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,820\nThis is, I like to say, up there,\n\n654\n00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,960\nwhich may be kind of that thing that\nsomeone's forgot that it's up on MySpace.\n\n655\n00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,770\nI can get that information,\nnow talk to them about an event or\n\n656\n00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,760\nsomething they forgot they had posted.\n\n657\n00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,830\nAnd now they are kind of my buddy now.\n\n658\n00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,140\nThat was something I could use for\nlater social engineering.\n\n659\n00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,245\nIt's actually quite fascinating.\n\n660\n00:33:54,245 --> 00:33:56,578\nWhen you get down it,\nfascinating at the fictional.\n\n661\n00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:57,600\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n662\n00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,703\n>> It is, how we say, fascinating.\n\n663\n00:33:58,703 --> 00:33:59,724\n[LAUGH].\n\n664\n00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:02,707\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n665\n00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,948\n>> But think about these things.\n\n666\n00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:08,533\nThere's so many social media\nnetworks out there that you\n\n667\n00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:14,250\ngotta kind of think about which ones\nare gonna give you the best information.\n\n668\n00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,250\nOther ones, Instagram,\nFlicker, stuff like that.\n\n669\n00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,410\nThere's all sorts of ones out there.\n\n670\n00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:22,370\nAnd I'm going to show you how those\nones come into play a little later,\n\n671\n00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,300\nlike having photos.\n\n672\n00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,740\nBut there's some really\ninteresting stuff and\n\n673\n00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,635\nthere's some, I guarantee there's some eye\nopening stuff in here for you as well.\n\n674\n00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:33,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, what I want to take a look at\n\n675\n00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,450\nhere is I want to talk about some of\nthe ways you can search this social media.\n\n676\n00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,620\nThere's actually search engines,\nbelieve it or\n\n677\n00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:43,910\nnot, that are specifically\ntailored to search social media.\n\n678\n00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:48,670\nAnd I am going to show\nyou some of those here.\n\n679\n00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,940\nI can't show you all of them, but\n\n680\n00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,770\nI'm going to show you some of the ones I\nthink are really good for helping you out.\n\n681\n00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:00,160\nYou know, one of the ones I am going\nto bring up on my screen here,\n\n682\n00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,600\nis, I'll do a quick refresh.\n\n683\n00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,845\nThis is one called the one\nmillion tweet map.\n\n684\n00:35:05,845 --> 00:35:09,410\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now, why might this be useful?\n\n685\n00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,400\nKeep my hands out where you can see them,\n\n686\n00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,870\nif you look at them,\nyou can see that there's numbers.\n\n687\n00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,420\nThere's highlighting and\nstuff like that in there.\n\n688\n00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,800\n>> It is dynamically changing, yeah.\n\n689\n00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,850\n>> Yeah, this is dynamically changing.\n\n690\n00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:27,610\nI can click on any one of these and\nactually drill in further and\n\n691\n00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,330\nfurther and further.\n\n692\n00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:32,869\nIf I was to click on over here,\nthe 61,000 tweets,\n\n693\n00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:37,970\nnow 61,404 tweets,\nin the California region, 407 now.\n\n694\n00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:42,750\nIf I click on it, I can, you can see\nas I click on it, what does it do?\n\n695\n00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:47,420\nIt zooms in a bit more and says, okay,\nwell here I've broken that cluster up and\n\n696\n00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,170\nshowed you smaller clusters\nthat make up that region.\n\n697\n00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:56,510\nNow I can go ahead and click on that on\na cluster here, in the San Francisco area.\n\n698\n00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,040\nClick on it.\n\n699\n00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,542\nZooms in a bit more.\n\n700\n00:36:00,542 --> 00:36:01,990\nNow, it's kind of scanning\n>> Wow.\n\n701\n00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,650\n>> Here's some more information.\n\n702\n00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:10,850\nI can go up into the area where I\nwhat I call home in Sacramento area.\n\n703\n00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,440\nNow, it's drilling down to Sacramento\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n704\n00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,950\n>> It zooms in a bit more.\n\n705\n00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,450\nLook at that.\n\n706\n00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,610\n>> Wait, my girlfriend's doing what.\n\n707\n00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,455\nI'll be right back.\n\n708\n00:36:21,455 --> 00:36:26,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, in any case, if I keep clicking\n\n709\n00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:32,060\ndown into here, you're gonna see\nthat information gets more detailed.\n\n710\n00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,810\nOnce it gets to the point\nwhere we see a white bubble.\n\n711\n00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,190\nThere that usually indicates,\nand it's refreshing here.\n\n712\n00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,220\nIt's got a big database behind it.\n\n713\n00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,670\nIf you click on one of these things.\n\n714\n00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:45,085\nThat probably wasn't the best one.\n\n715\n00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:48,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You do have to be careful.\n\n716\n00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,260\n>> We're doing live tv like this.\n\n717\n00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,490\n>> Yeah, this is live, people.\n\n718\n00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:54,200\n>> Some of the things we would just claim,\nwhere some might not be appropriate.\n\n719\n00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,920\nWe have no control over what\nthese people are tweeting about.\n\n720\n00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,790\n>> Yeah, so.\n\n721\n00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,910\n>> In any case.\n\n722\n00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,280\n>> Whew!\nAll right.\n\n723\n00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,130\nBeen an exciting day, hasn't it?\n\n724\n00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:11,620\nBut in any case, what you have is when\nyou click on these little bubbles,\n\n725\n00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,970\nyou can see I've got someone's tweet here.\n\n726\n00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:19,340\nAnd if you look at the date on it,\n3/25 at 5:40.\n\n727\n00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,912\nSo this is only, what, a couple hours old?\n\n728\n00:37:22,912 --> 00:37:26,093\n>> A couple hours old, yeah.\n\n729\n00:37:26,093 --> 00:37:31,093\nYou're seeing stuff, and\nalso if you kind of read into it,\n\n730\n00:37:31,093 --> 00:37:34,950\nyou can see exactly where that person is.\n\n731\n00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,390\nNow it may not be 100 percent accurate,\nbut\n\n732\n00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,040\nthink about it,\nwhat might make that accurate?\n\n733\n00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,980\nI just told you in the previous\nsegment about IP addresses,\n\n734\n00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,570\nthat IP addresses may not give\nyou exact geographic information.\n\n735\n00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,340\nWell think about it,\n\n736\n00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:51,230\nwhen you get down to it what are most\npeople posting with nowadays?\n\n737\n00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:51,920\nCell phones.\n\n738\n00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,510\n>> Right.\n\n739\n00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,700\n>> So cell phones are going to give you\nup because you are posting through that\n\n740\n00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,420\ncellular network and\nbeing targeted off of towers.\n\n741\n00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,440\nAnd heck,\nmay even have their GPS turned on.\n\n742\n00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,840\nThat could be very, very accurate.\n\n743\n00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,840\nI'd be almost willing to bet that that's\nfairly accurate that that person was in\n\n744\n00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,740\nthat general vicinity at that time.\n\n745\n00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,440\n>> Yeah, it is amazing.\n\n746\n00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,230\nAnd the thing is if people don't think\nabout the fact that I'm just tweeting my\n\n747\n00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,750\nfriends or whatever,\nand here we are on a TV\n\n748\n00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,480\nshow on the Internet pulling up their\ntweet in front of all these viewers.\n\n749\n00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,154\nThey probably didn't think anything about\nor that didn't even cross their minds as\n\n750\n00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:30,062\na possibility, that this would be\nbroadcast out on the Internet.\n\n751\n00:38:30,062 --> 00:38:33,992\nAnd that's what happens is people\ntalk about business related thing,\n\n752\n00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:38,383\ncompany related things, confidential\nthings that they shouldn't be talking\n\n753\n00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,820\nabout in these types of social media.\n\n754\n00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:45,560\nBut they don't think about the fact of who\nis gonna be able to view that information.\n\n755\n00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,260\n>> Yeah, the people just don't think,\nthey're hey, let's share it out, and\n\n756\n00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,600\nlet's start taking a look and\nputting stuff out there.\n\n757\n00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,210\nEveryone wants to know what's going on,\npeople are very chatty.\n\n758\n00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,500\nAnd you can see,\nI can see they're very chatty.\n\n759\n00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,940\nIn the time you were just talking there\nMike, 50 new tweets showed up in there.\n\n760\n00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,380\nYou can see in the upper\nleft of the screen,\n\n761\n00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,830\nyou can see that it says how\nmany tweets since page load.\n\n762\n00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,542\nIt says 3,098.\n\n763\n00:39:11,542 --> 00:39:12,464\n>> 3,098.\n\n764\n00:39:12,464 --> 00:39:16,860\n>> I haven't been there this long, but\n\n765\n00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,180\nwhen you started giving your\nwhole thing there, it was 3048.\n\n766\n00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,920\nNow, it's at 3098.\n\n767\n00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,260\nIt hopped up pretty quickly.\n\n768\n00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,860\n>> That is amazing.\n\n769\n00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,390\n>> So, it's very, very active.\n\n770\n00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,430\nAnd if we zoomed out, it will have more\nactivity as it starts counting for\n\n771\n00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,475\nmore areas.\n\n772\n00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:37,750\nI mean, so.\n\n773\n00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:38,540\n>> Look at that number go.\n\n774\n00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:43,028\nAnd, yeah, it's crazy.\n\n775\n00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:48,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so just think about that.\n\n776\n00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:50,925\nI saw over here,\nI'm never posting on social media again.\n\n777\n00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:54,213\n>> [LAUGH}\n>> But\n\n778\n00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:58,340\nas they used to say in the old\ninfomercials, but wait there's more.\n\n779\n00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can do more with this, okay?\n\n780\n00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:07,636\nYeah, I see James saying there's local law\nenforcement has tools similar for this.\n\n781\n00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:08,787\nYeah, I've got one of those too.\n\n782\n00:40:08,787 --> 00:40:11,547\nAnd I'll show that later.\n\n783\n00:40:11,547 --> 00:40:12,859\nFor no extra cost.\n\n784\n00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:14,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n785\n00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,380\nlets take a look at another way\nwe can look at social media.\n\n786\n00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,260\nThat's through a tool called Echosec.\n\n787\n00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,390\nYou can find this at app.echosec.net.\n\n788\n00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:32,970\nAnd this is one of my\nfavorites in the world.\n\n789\n00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,065\nWhat you can do with this one\nis I can put in an address.\n\n790\n00:40:37,065 --> 00:40:37,969\nGive me your home address.\n\n791\n00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:41,033\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No.\n\n792\n00:40:41,033 --> 00:40:44,025\nNice try, Sean.\n\n793\n00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,172\n>> Come on, it's just for test purposes.\n\n794\n00:40:46,172 --> 00:40:47,639\n>> My friend's in social engineering.\n\n795\n00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:50,756\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] I didn't say it was elegant.\n\n796\n00:40:50,756 --> 00:40:55,760\nAll right, so\n\n797\n00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,980\nwhat I can do is, if I put in an area like\nLas Vegas, and I'll find an area there.\n\n798\n00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,110\nI'm trying to find something that's\ngot a lot of activity going on.\n\n799\n00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:10,370\nSo there's Las Vegas Airport.\n\n800\n00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:13,470\nWhat I'm gonna do is, I know there's\na lot of tourists and everything there.\n\n801\n00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:17,068\nAnd this is live data I'm\ngonna be seeing here.\n\n802\n00:41:17,068 --> 00:41:21,369\nWhat I will do is, I'm gonna say\nthis street corner right here,\n\n803\n00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:23,290\nthat looks like a good area.\n\n804\n00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:25,540\nSo I'm gonna do Select Area, and\n\n805\n00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,280\nI'm going to highlight a box,\nyou can put that box in there.\n\n806\n00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,292\nYou can draw a polygon and\nstuff like that.\n\n807\n00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:39,646\nWhat's happening is that you are gonna\nsee it pulled up stuff in here.\n\n808\n00:41:39,646 --> 00:41:42,669\nAnd again, this is live data.\n\n809\n00:41:42,669 --> 00:41:45,007\nThere's a disclaimer there.\n\n810\n00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:49,121\nI'm seeing a live daily pullout\nout of social networks in here.\n\n811\n00:41:49,121 --> 00:41:52,285\nSo, that looks kind of cool, but\n\n812\n00:41:52,285 --> 00:41:57,147\nlet's scroll down and\nsee what we actually found.\n\n813\n00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,726\nOkay, we've got tweets from people,\n\n814\n00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:03,959\nwe've got some guy that apparently\nlikes to have his shirt off.\n\n815\n00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:08,729\nBut take a good look at this one right\ndown here, at the date on this one.\n\n816\n00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:11,839\n3/25, 7:40 AM.\n\n817\n00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,458\nNow, what time is it right now?\n\n818\n00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:14,539\n>> That was about four minutes ago.\n\n819\n00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:19,506\n>> Yeah, four minutes ago that was posted.\n\n820\n00:42:19,506 --> 00:42:21,567\n>> And so this one,\nnot only can you zoom in, but\n\n821\n00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,619\nyou could actually target\nan individual building, for example?\n\n822\n00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:27,020\nYou could draw your shape.\n\n823\n00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,201\nI wanna do maybe some kind of\nreconnaissance on this one building, cuz I\n\n824\n00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:33,925\nknow that that company is having a meeting\nhere, some kind of conference going on.\n\n825\n00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:37,408\nSo I can limit this to just that one\nbuilding by drawing a shape around it?\n\n826\n00:42:37,408 --> 00:42:38,696\n>> Yes, yeah.\n\n827\n00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:42,151\nAnd if this doesn't make you\nkinda really question if\n\n828\n00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:46,986\nyou should be using social media or\nnot, or what you're putting on there,\n\n829\n00:42:46,986 --> 00:42:51,076\nI'm not going to sit here and\ntell you don't use social media.\n\n830\n00:42:51,076 --> 00:42:53,499\nI don't want you take away from it.\n\n831\n00:42:53,499 --> 00:42:54,264\n>> Hey, that has its values.\n\n832\n00:42:54,264 --> 00:42:55,354\n>> Oh, is that your picture, Michael?\n\n833\n00:42:55,354 --> 00:42:58,395\nOkay, that's good.\n\n834\n00:42:58,395 --> 00:42:59,868\n>> [LAUGH] Nice job on the abs, Michael.\n\n835\n00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:04,349\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so,\nyou can scroll through this and\n\n836\n00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,079\nyou can see the stuff is very, very new.\n\n837\n00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,700\nI mean and it will go back further.\n\n838\n00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,090\nIf you start scrolling down,\nyou'll see older, progressively older and\n\n839\n00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,981\nolder dates and times in there.\n\n840\n00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:19,766\nAnd it does go back a ways,\nwhich is also kind of scary, too.\n\n841\n00:43:19,766 --> 00:43:20,612\n>> It really is.\n\n842\n00:43:20,612 --> 00:43:22,158\nSo not what you just posted, but\n\n843\n00:43:22,158 --> 00:43:26,004\nwhat you posted yesterday when you had\nthat extra drink, and things like that.\n\n844\n00:43:26,004 --> 00:43:28,067\n>> I've seen it go back to 2010.\n\n845\n00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,110\n>> Really?\n\n846\n00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:30,955\nWow.\n>> Yeah, and the neat thing about a tool\n\n847\n00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:32,765\nlike this is if you didn't notice,\n\n848\n00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:36,615\nthe tool actually has something\nwhere you can narrow the date range.\n\n849\n00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:40,775\nSo you could say, okay, I know someone\nwas in that location on a certain date,\n\n850\n00:43:40,775 --> 00:43:43,180\nand they happen to be\nvery chatty on Twitter.\n\n851\n00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:46,260\nWell, you could just put a box at\nthe area, filter out the date, and\n\n852\n00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,410\nsee if it brings anything back.\n\n853\n00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:55,150\nAnd, keep in mind, when you're looking\nat a utility like Echosec, you could see\n\n854\n00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,100\nthat under really any of these pictures,\nit's got those blue links on there.\n\n855\n00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,060\nI can click on any one of those and\n\n856\n00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,180\ngo directly to that social\nmedia account from here.\n\n857\n00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,850\nSo that means once you find something\nthat's of interest, you can drill in and\n\n858\n00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:10,140\nstart going through that\nsocial media account.\n\n859\n00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:13,040\nAnd think of the stuff that people put on\nthose social media accounts to tell you\n\n860\n00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,130\nwho they are and what they are.\n\n861\n00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:21,254\nAnd it's amazing just how\ndynamic this thing is.\n\n862\n00:44:21,254 --> 00:44:26,738\nThis thing can give you information\nthat is very, very, very recent.\n\n863\n00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:31,355\nVery, very, very recent.\n\n864\n00:44:31,355 --> 00:44:33,448\nThis is a tool I frequently show, and\n\n865\n00:44:33,448 --> 00:44:37,852\nsome of these reactions that I'm seeing\non here, wow, and stuff like that.\n\n866\n00:44:37,852 --> 00:44:42,161\nThese are typical reactions to\nget to something like this,\n\n867\n00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:44,499\ncuz we all know it's out there.\n\n868\n00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:48,459\nAnd they're like, well, okay,\nhow do I find or play with Google?\n\n869\n00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:49,020\nGoogle hacking.\n\n870\n00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,550\n>> I gotta be a super hacker to\nget this kind of information back.\n\n871\n00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,078\nI really got to know what I'm doing\nif I wanna narrow down tweets and\n\n872\n00:44:55,078 --> 00:44:58,684\nsocial media posts to a particular\ndate and a particular building.\n\n873\n00:44:58,684 --> 00:44:59,412\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> No,\n\n874\n00:44:59,412 --> 00:45:03,260\nI just have to pull up a web page and\ntype in this information.\n\n875\n00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:06,490\n>> Yeah, I have made it very,\nvery, quick and easy now.\n\n876\n00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:13,153\nIn a few clicks,\nI've pulled up very recent information.\n\n877\n00:45:13,153 --> 00:45:18,252\nSo, it's definitely something that\nshould be catching your attention and\n\n878\n00:45:18,252 --> 00:45:20,092\nmaking you think about it.\n\n879\n00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:24,694\nOne of my things I did when I demo'd\nthis to a group once, it was funny,\n\n880\n00:45:24,694 --> 00:45:28,673\nI was showing them how the fact\nthat there was somebody that,\n\n881\n00:45:28,673 --> 00:45:31,949\nwhen we pulled into\nthe parking lot that morning,\n\n882\n00:45:31,949 --> 00:45:37,046\nthey parked right next to my car, and\nthat's the only reason I knew the face.\n\n883\n00:45:37,046 --> 00:45:41,658\nShe had walked in the building\nnext door to where I was,\n\n884\n00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:44,976\nmaybe ten minutes earlier at the most.\n\n885\n00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:48,502\nAnd so, when I was in class,\nI was showing this website, and\n\n886\n00:45:48,502 --> 00:45:52,721\nI highlighted the address of the area,\nthe building I was currently in,\n\n887\n00:45:52,721 --> 00:45:56,616\nand I saw that she had posted in\nten minutes, like fifteen tweets.\n\n888\n00:45:56,616 --> 00:46:00,521\nAnd I looked at them,\nI knew exactly where she was.\n\n889\n00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:03,161\nI immediately knew how many kids she had,\nand\n\n890\n00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:06,510\nthe job she was working when\nshe wasn't going to school.\n\n891\n00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,540\nShe had them all posted\non her social media.\n\n892\n00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,363\n>> Holy cow.\n\n893\n00:46:09,363 --> 00:46:13,420\n>> Yeah,\nI was able to find it that easily.\n\n894\n00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,440\nIn a few clicks.\n\n895\n00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,230\n>> And this is again,\nthis is information I can turn around and\n\n896\n00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,881\nuse in those next phases of our attack.\n\n897\n00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:22,876\n>> Yeah.\nI'm now able to track someone's movements\n\n898\n00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:25,749\nand get personal information about them.\n\n899\n00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,881\nThat may be very useful for\nsocial engineering.\n\n900\n00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:31,364\nAnd you think of this lady,\nshe has eight kids in there.\n\n901\n00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:37,270\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I could say, how is she not tired?\n\n902\n00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:41,598\nAnd next thing I'd say is, I could start,\nstrike up a conservation with her.\n\n903\n00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:44,160\nMake comments like my kids\nkeep me up all the time,\n\n904\n00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,990\nand I'm always cleaning up after them.\n\n905\n00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:47,860\nShe's gonna have something\nto say about it.\n\n906\n00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,900\n>> She's gonna pipe right in and\nthere's your media connection.\n\n907\n00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,710\n>> Yeah, I can start forming that bond and\ngetting things,\n\n908\n00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,260\nso it's fascinating what\nyou can do with it.\n\n909\n00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:01,700\nAnd I would encourage you, a lot of\nthe stuff, just to play around with it.\n\n910\n00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,891\nMikayla's put a good question up\nhere that I just noticed in there.\n\n911\n00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:05,699\nI think this is a great thing.\n\n912\n00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:06,239\n>> Yeah.\n\n913\n00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,700\n>> Identifying rogue tweeters at work.\n\n914\n00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,379\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Yes, yes it is.\n\n915\n00:47:10,379 --> 00:47:12,463\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, I'm thinking a lot of these,\n\n916\n00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:15,612\nyou see in the news now, sports teams,\nespecially high school teams and\n\n917\n00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:19,274\nthings like this, college teams, where\nthey don't want their players Tweeting in\n\n918\n00:47:19,274 --> 00:47:22,343\nthe middle of the game, doing the smack\ntalking and things like that.\n\n919\n00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:26,228\nThis would be a great way, cuz you could\nnarrow down that geographical area to just\n\n920\n00:47:26,228 --> 00:47:28,618\nthat high school stadium or\nsomething like that.\n\n921\n00:47:28,618 --> 00:47:32,485\nOr as Mikayla's saying, if you're\nnot supposed to be tweeting at work,\n\n922\n00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:34,755\nsomebody could be sitting\nthere monitoring it now.\n\n923\n00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,377\nAnd these people think, oh,\nnobody is going to see me,\n\n924\n00:47:36,377 --> 00:47:37,320\nI'm in the bathroom tweeting.\n\n925\n00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,385\nAnd surprise, they're waiting for\nyou when you come out of the bathroom.\n\n926\n00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:41,004\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n927\n00:47:41,004 --> 00:47:44,138\nyou can't stay hidden\nwith this type of stuff.\n\n928\n00:47:44,138 --> 00:47:47,200\nYou can find it quite easily.\n\n929\n00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,630\nNow, some of the stuff I saw over here\nwas, well, can you filter by user name?\n\n930\n00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,587\nUnfortunately, you can't.\n\n931\n00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:57,070\nThere is a, as you can see at the top\nof the page, if you're looking at this,\n\n932\n00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,840\nthere's a little yellow box that there's\nthis upgrade to another version of it.\n\n933\n00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,250\nMaybe that version has it.\n\n934\n00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,920\nI don't know.\n\n935\n00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,449\nWith what I have here,\n\n936\n00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:10,410\nI have a good amount of\ninformation already at this point.\n\n937\n00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:14,030\nI don't see a reason for me personally\nto upgrade to a live version but\n\n938\n00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:16,868\nthat might very well\ninclude that functionality.\n\n939\n00:48:16,868 --> 00:48:18,780\nBut I have found being able to, you know,\n\n940\n00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:23,790\ngo to a specific location and draw\na box around it and filter by name and\n\n941\n00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:28,770\nall that or filter by time rather,\nI found that's sufficient.\n\n942\n00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:32,260\n>> And we were seeing things from just\na little bit ago, so when we see live,\n\n943\n00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:37,920\nthat must be down to the second\nsearch of the minutes there.\n\n944\n00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,592\nThe newest one I've ever seen on that,\ncuz that one was,\n\n945\n00:48:40,592 --> 00:48:43,860\nyou said, four or\nfive minutes something like that.\n\n946\n00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,370\nI saw one that was posted less than\na minute before I did the search,\n\n947\n00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:51,260\nso when we say live,\nthat's about as live as you can get.\n\n948\n00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,580\n>> That's about as live as anything.\n\n949\n00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,625\n>> Yeah, I might as well just be\nlooking over the person's shoulder.\n\n950\n00:48:54,625 --> 00:48:56,540\nIt's like, dude, you spelled that wrong.\n\n951\n00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:58,490\nYou know, I might as well be\nsaying that at that point\n\n952\n00:48:59,615 --> 00:49:01,305\nbecause you're getting to that.\n\n953\n00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,125\n>> Yeah, and don't forget,\n\n954\n00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:05,745\nit's not that we're seeing just\nthe fact that they are tweeting.\n\n955\n00:49:05,745 --> 00:49:07,515\nWe're seeing what they're tweeting.\n\n956\n00:49:07,515 --> 00:49:11,075\nWe're seeing all the information, so\nthat person's talking about the boss, or\n\n957\n00:49:11,075 --> 00:49:14,295\nif that person is talking about\nthat project that he's working on,\n\n958\n00:49:14,295 --> 00:49:17,305\nthat they're not supposed to be\ntalking with outside the organization,\n\n959\n00:49:17,305 --> 00:49:20,885\nthere's my evidence right there that I\ntake in and I go to that employee with,\n\n960\n00:49:20,885 --> 00:49:25,010\nor as a hacker, I mean,\nthis is invaluable information.\n\n961\n00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,660\nI can sound like I'm part\nof the company with all\n\n962\n00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,770\nthe information I'm gathering from this.\n\n963\n00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:31,110\n>> Yeah, and\nthen there's other things in here too.\n\n964\n00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:35,340\nIt's like you could, once you see someone\non these networks, you could see, okay,\n\n965\n00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,780\nthey're on that network.\n\n966\n00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,540\nLook at who their follower list is, and\ntheir friends list are, as appropriate.\n\n967\n00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,860\nAnd then you can start searching on\nthose names, there are ways to do that.\n\n968\n00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,710\nIn fact there's one called ZabaSearch and\nthere's another one called People,\n\n969\n00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:52,440\nthere's another one called Spokeo,\n\n970\n00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,450\nthere's plenty of them out there that\nyou can drill deeper into these things,\n\n971\n00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:00,690\nso you can find the name of someone and\npull it off their account.\n\n972\n00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:02,980\nFInd someone that's following\nsomeone on here and\n\n973\n00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:07,810\nsay, okay, well, those followers may\nbe working with that individual.\n\n974\n00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:10,750\nLet me just pull that information over.\n\n975\n00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,870\nSo you could start finding\nthe people that travel together and\n\n976\n00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,320\nwork together and\nget some good information.\n\n977\n00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,520\n>> Yeah, yeah, and\nwe see some posts in the chat.\n\n978\n00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,785\nDavid Beam just posted somebody is\nnow tweeting about their court date.\n\n979\n00:50:23,785 --> 00:50:26,839\n[LAUGH] Isn't that amazing?\n\n980\n00:50:26,839 --> 00:50:29,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Crazy people, and\n\n981\n00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,060\nthey just don't know any better.\n\n982\n00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:34,090\nI mean, that's the problem and so the\ninformation we can just find is amazing.\n\n983\n00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:35,441\nSo a lot of different tools,\n\n984\n00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:38,550\na lot of different ways we can go\nabout getting this information.\n\n985\n00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:42,340\nWe took a look at, well, I don't know\nif we want to do some people searches.\n\n986\n00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,720\nWe've got a couple minutes\nbefore we go on break.\n\n987\n00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,580\nYou want to try one?\n\n988\n00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,840\n>> Yeah, lets take a look.\n\n989\n00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:53,220\nI've got one up here for ZabaSearch,\nwas one of the ones I was mentioning.\n\n990\n00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,100\nZabaSearch.\n\n991\n00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,560\nNow I can type in a name.\n\n992\n00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,980\nI'll just go ahead and use mine.\n\n993\n00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,990\nI type in ZabaSearch and\nlook at that, I'm a ninja.\n\n994\n00:51:03,990 --> 00:51:05,520\nThat's awesome.\n\n995\n00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,868\nNo public information.\n\n996\n00:51:06,868 --> 00:51:09,901\nLook at that.\n>> [NOISE] [LAUGH]\n\n997\n00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,510\n>> The force is strong with this one.\n\n998\n00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,380\nAll right.\n\n999\n00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,710\nSo you can type in names in here,\nand I'm just trying names at random.\n\n1000\n00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:21,320\nIf I typed in like, let's try a more\ngeneric name like John Smith.\n\n1001\n00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,950\nWhat you are seeing here is you're seeing,\nyou know, it's giving names.\n\n1002\n00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,540\nIt's giving addresses.\n\n1003\n00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,180\nNow the thing to remember with something\nlike this is first of all is John Smith.\n\n1004\n00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,530\nI typed that in because\nthat is a name that-\n\n1005\n00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:35,180\n>> You knew some results were\n\n1006\n00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,385\ngoing to come back.\n\n1007\n00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:39,660\n>> Yeah, I know that there are going to\nbe people out there with that same name.\n\n1008\n00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:44,390\nIf you have a common name, you may\nhave to do more to narrow it down, and\n\n1009\n00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,310\nthat would require you doing more\nresearch, but we already are getting\n\n1010\n00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:50,840\nthe tools to do that, to say okay,\nI need to find out this or this or\n\n1011\n00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:56,370\nthis to kind of start, you know, pulling\nsome of that noise out of the background.\n\n1012\n00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:01,730\nBut once you have that, you can see in\nhere I've got name, I've got phone number.\n\n1013\n00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,660\nThing I want you to keep in mind\nwith these things is they're not\n\n1014\n00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,510\nalways 100% accurate.\n\n1015\n00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:12,990\nKeep in mind that if you try to\nlook at these phone numbers or\n\n1016\n00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:18,430\naddresses, you may need to cross reference\nthat there's something else to verify it.\n\n1017\n00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,360\n>> Could be a previous address or\na previous phone number and it just hasn't\n\n1018\n00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,230\nbeen updated in this particular\ndatabase or something like that.\n\n1019\n00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,580\n>> Yeah, it could just be bogus.\n\n1020\n00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,550\nIt could just be they\ngot something messed up.\n\n1021\n00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,208\nIf you pull myself up in some\nof these engines, I have yet\n\n1022\n00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:38,780\nto find an engine that's\ngot my current info on it.\n\n1023\n00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:43,710\nAll my info it has,\none just put on information for\n\n1024\n00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,720\nthe place I lived fifteen years ago.\n\n1025\n00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,220\n>> Wow.\n\n1026\n00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,390\n>> I mean,\na lot of that has to do with me,\n\n1027\n00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:54,080\nI tend to be very careful with\nthe information I disseminate.\n\n1028\n00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:00,450\nWhen I moved in to my new house a few\nyears ago, I planned stuff ahead of time.\n\n1029\n00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,620\nI knew I was going to be moving.\n\n1030\n00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,280\nI already had a checklist done on what\nsteps I was going to take to make sure\n\n1031\n00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,960\nthat address didn't show\nup in certain areas.\n\n1032\n00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,329\n>> You could put it on Facebook,\nand pictures of the new house.\n\n1033\n00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:12,662\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> There's that.\n\n1034\n00:53:12,662 --> 00:53:14,462\nI mean, come on.\n\n1035\n00:53:14,462 --> 00:53:19,801\nSome of it has to do with what\nI'd actually done myself and\n\n1036\n00:53:19,801 --> 00:53:25,080\nit worked, it's been very,\nvery, very effective.\n\n1037\n00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,208\nVery, very, very effective.\n\n1038\n00:53:26,208 --> 00:53:31,780\n[LAUGH]\nJust depends on how you want to do it,\n\n1039\n00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,110\nbut keep that in mind,\nthis information may not be 100% current.\n\n1040\n00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:39,920\nYou also can ask to be removed\nfrom some of these as well, so\n\n1041\n00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,010\nif you don't want your stuff up here,\nsometimes you can actually just,\n\n1042\n00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,590\nthere's a link on there and\nyou can say remove it.\n\n1043\n00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:50,660\nAnd the bad thing about it is the removal\ninstructions for sites like this may not\n\n1044\n00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:54,720\nalways be right up there easy to do,\nand they may be kind of convoluted.\n\n1045\n00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,610\nSome of them will say you've got to\nprint out these forms and send them in,\n\n1046\n00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,040\nthey're just trying kind of make it so,\n>> Make it so\n\n1047\n00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,490\ndifficult you don't really\nfollow through and do it.\n\n1048\n00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,540\nThe information's there,\nwe got it we don't want to give it up.\n\n1049\n00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,600\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1050\n00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,550\nBut the stuff's there.\n\n1051\n00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,510\nIt's a valid tool.\n\n1052\n00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,780\nThere's a ZabaSearch is one, PIPL or\n\n1053\n00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:20,140\npeople is an old school one that's\nworks and still around, does it's job.\n\n1054\n00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:26,090\nLike I said, SpokeO is a data aggregator\nthat goes across multiple things.\n\n1055\n00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:30,425\nYou know there's Intellius, is another\none that you can buy records from,\n\n1056\n00:54:30,425 --> 00:54:31,290\nif you want.\n\n1057\n00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,840\nSo there's a lot of them out there.\n\n1058\n00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,040\nYou just kinda find which one works for\nyou.\n\n1059\n00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,980\n>> All right ladies and\ngentlemen, tell you what.\n\n1060\n00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,410\nIt is time for us to take our break.\n\n1061\n00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,674\nWhen we come back, we are gonna\ncontinue on with our foot printing and\n\n1062\n00:54:42,674 --> 00:54:45,052\na little more social media or\nsocial networking.\n\n1063\n00:54:45,052 --> 00:54:49,917\nAnd then Sean is gonna share some of his\nsuper secret ninja techniques that he\n\n1064\n00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,902\nuses to stay under that radar.\n\n1065\n00:54:51,902 --> 00:54:52,896\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1066\n00:54:52,896 --> 00:54:53,859\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1067\n00:54:53,859 --> 00:55:01,289\n[SOUND].\n\n1068\n00:55:01,289 --> 00:55:04,330\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1069\n00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,740\nContinuing on with our\nfootprinting chapter,\n\n1070\n00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,040\nwe're now going to dive into\nthe world of social engineering, or\n\n1071\n00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,960\nat least take a small look at some of the\nthings we can do with social engineering.\n\n1072\n00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,040\nAt least in this particular phase of\nour process, that footprinting or\n\n1073\n00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,880\nthat reconnaissance phase.\n\n1074\n00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,900\nAnd I'm sure this is another big one.\n\n1075\n00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,085\nWhere do we even want to start\nwith social engineering?\n\n1076\n00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:26,580\n>> [LAUGH] Yes, that's the trick there.\n\n1077\n00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:31,390\nI think it's important to define\nwhat social engineering actually\n\n1078\n00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,810\nis before we just kind of dive into it.\n\n1079\n00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:40,069\nThis is really, at this stage,\na primer on social engineering.\n\n1080\n00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:47,460\nBob's going to do an episode later on\nthat focuses much more tightly on this.\n\n1081\n00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,705\nBut I think it is important\nto bring it up now,\n\n1082\n00:55:49,705 --> 00:55:53,380\nbecause it is going to be an important\npart of your footprinting process.\n\n1083\n00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,454\nBecause your footprinting process\nis about gathering information, and\n\n1084\n00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:00,880\nsocial engineering is a very\ngood way to gather information.\n\n1085\n00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,160\nSo what is social engineering?\n\n1086\n00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,342\nSocial engineering is a way of not\njust manipulating human beings but\n\n1087\n00:56:09,342 --> 00:56:12,560\nalso taking advantage of human habits.\n\n1088\n00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:13,324\n>> Right, normal human nature.\n\n1089\n00:56:13,324 --> 00:56:14,266\n>> And trust.\n\n1090\n00:56:14,266 --> 00:56:16,120\nYeah, it's exploiting all those things.\n\n1091\n00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:22,070\nExploiting relationships, trust,\nall these things can work towards you.\n\n1092\n00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:24,320\nOr work towards your benefit.\n\n1093\n00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,150\nYou'll find that first of all human\nbeings are very, very, very habitual.\n\n1094\n00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:33,270\nThey follow set patterns and\nset practices.\n\n1095\n00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:35,100\nThey will do certain things.\n\n1096\n00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,800\nAct certain ways.\n\n1097\n00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,530\nSo you can take advantage of that.\n\n1098\n00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:42,720\nAnd on top of that, if there are certain\nways that if you challenge them.\n\n1099\n00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,290\nThat you know they will\nrespond in a certain manner.\n\n1100\n00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,860\nAnd then, if you're really good at it, you\ncan actually read people's body language\n\n1101\n00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,929\nand that, and kinda get an idea of what's\ngoing on and use that information.\n\n1102\n00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,925\n>> Absolutely.\nYou know,\n\n1103\n00:56:56,925 --> 00:57:00,510\nwhen we look at that human nature,\npeople, by nature, we want to be liked.\n\n1104\n00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:04,164\nWe want to be accepted by our peers and\nthings like that, so\n\n1105\n00:57:04,164 --> 00:57:06,485\nwe do things to try to help with that.\n\n1106\n00:57:06,485 --> 00:57:09,550\nRight, we want to help people.\n\n1107\n00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:15,490\nWe answer questions for them, in the hopes\nthat that's gonna make them like us or\n\n1108\n00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,170\nmake them want to be our friend and\nthings like that.\n\n1109\n00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:22,590\nOr get recognition among peers and\nthings like that and\n\n1110\n00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,070\nthat's what we can take advantage of.\n\n1111\n00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:28,290\nAnd it's probably and, like I said, we'll\ngo in depth on it in a later episode, but\n\n1112\n00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:31,540\nit is really one of the more\ndifficult things to protect against,\n\n1113\n00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,300\nwhen it comes to securing our networks and\nour information.\n\n1114\n00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:37,390\n>> Yeah, one of the things\nabout social engineering,\n\n1115\n00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:41,910\nthere really is no technology\nthat can help you out with that.\n\n1116\n00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:46,650\nIt's purely a measure\nof training someone to\n\n1117\n00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:49,630\n>> User education, if I can spit that out.\n\n1118\n00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:53,510\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] It's security awareness training\n\n1119\n00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,630\nis what it comes down to.\n\n1120\n00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:59,945\nAnd this is the tricky part, is that\ncompanies do have a big problem defending\n\n1121\n00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:05,495\nagainst it because, could you put your\naverage user through a course like this.\n\n1122\n00:58:05,495 --> 00:58:07,335\nIt's not going to help them.\n\n1123\n00:58:07,335 --> 00:58:09,635\nIt's just going to shoot so\nfar over their heads.\n\n1124\n00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:11,935\n>> They don't care.\nThey don't want to know.\n\n1125\n00:58:11,935 --> 00:58:15,705\nOne of my favorite sayings is that\nthere is no patch for human stupidity.\n\n1126\n00:58:15,705 --> 00:58:20,090\nYou know I can't go download something and\ninsert it into them.\n\n1127\n00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,375\nYeah, it just doesn't work.\n\n1128\n00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:24,340\n>> Yes, that's definitely true.\n\n1129\n00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:29,050\nThat you can't patch it, or\nsomething else I like to say is you\n\n1130\n00:58:29,050 --> 00:58:33,990\ncan train people and you kind of gotta\nretrain them because they will forget it.\n\n1131\n00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:38,650\nThere's a habit to kind of forget stuff,\nwhich I like to put in terms of\n\n1132\n00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,768\nyou can make something idiot proof but\nthen they'll just invent a better idiot.\n\n1133\n00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:45,110\n>> [LAUGH].\nSo I'm a little bit more pessimistic,\n\n1134\n00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:46,710\nI guess.\n\n1135\n00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:49,826\nHey I liked it and some of you will\nbe stealing that later, trust me.\n\n1136\n00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:50,396\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1137\n00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:54,158\n[LAUGH]\n>> But, so like I said there's no\n\n1138\n00:58:54,158 --> 00:58:58,940\ntechnology that can\nreally help you out here.\n\n1139\n00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,550\nIt's an education thing.\n\n1140\n00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,100\nIt's an awareness thing.\n\n1141\n00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Companies have to get\n\n1142\n00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:04,928\npeople through a course like this.\n\n1143\n00:59:04,928 --> 00:59:07,970\nAnd they can't put them\nthrough Security+ course or\n\n1144\n00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:12,430\nanything like that because that's\nstill more than the average Joe needs.\n\n1145\n00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:18,500\nThere has to be a regular kind\nof basic security awareness.\n\n1146\n00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,240\n>> Yeah.\n>> Letting them know that you know,\n\n1147\n00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,630\nthere's things that they can and can't do.\n\n1148\n00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:26,580\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, well practices I've seen,\n\n1149\n00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,700\none of them I've seen in the army myself,\n\n1150\n00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:35,540\nI see that where they do yearly\nsecurity awareness training.\n\n1151\n00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,810\nTo maintain your access to the network and\ndoing things, you have to take this\n\n1152\n00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,950\ncourse, which you'll get a certificate\nprinted out of it, which maybe you may\n\n1153\n00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:48,910\nlook at it and say, well, that's kind of\njust a cheap whatever way to do things.\n\n1154\n00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:51,420\nYeah, you look at the thing going,\nyeah, I know this, but\n\n1155\n00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:53,080\nnow it's fresher in your mind again.\n\n1156\n00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,600\nSo things like that.\n\n1157\n00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:58,760\nBut you really have to be\naware of the dangers of it.\n\n1158\n00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,200\nReally make people acquainted\nwith what it actually is so\n\n1159\n01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:07,460\nthey can start recognizing it and\nmaybe keep their mouths shut, get more.\n\n1160\n01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:09,415\nI mean we just saw that,\nin what, our previous segment?\n\n1161\n01:00:09,415 --> 01:00:11,610\nSolid social media and all that.\n\n1162\n01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:15,840\nYou know, a lot of you I'm sure were\nplaying with the, you know, Echosec and\n\n1163\n01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,130\nstuff like that.\n\n1164\n01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:20,350\nI mean it's a good example of\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n1165\n01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:25,128\nWe're talking about people sharing stuff\nand wanting to kind of set up communities\n\n1166\n01:00:25,128 --> 01:00:29,700\nand stuff like that online and like you\nsaid, be liked and things like that.\n\n1167\n01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:34,650\nAnd that kind of goes towards,\nworking in my favor as a social engineer.\n\n1168\n01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:37,240\n>> Absolutely, Michaela out there\nhas a really good question.\n\n1169\n01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,800\nShe asks, as social engineering is one\nof the bigger vulnerabilities that we\n\n1170\n01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,754\nface in our organizations, how many of the\norganizations when they hire a pin tester,\n\n1171\n01:00:45,754 --> 01:00:49,540\ndo they specify that I also want\nto also test that human element?\n\n1172\n01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,670\nOr is that something that\ngets left out a lot of times?\n\n1173\n01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:57,120\n>> It's usually a case of they'll either\nmix it in with the technical test, and\n\n1174\n01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,830\nin some cases they will do\nit as a test on their own.\n\n1175\n01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:05,890\nIt's kind of up to the company\nto decide if that's something\n\n1176\n01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,490\nthat's really necessary.\n\n1177\n01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:12,960\nI would encourage you if your going to be\na pin tester to really tell your client,\n\n1178\n01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,650\nmaybe you want to factor this\nin because it is over looked.\n\n1179\n01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,305\nAs I said when we started\nthis journey into CEH,\n\n1180\n01:01:22,305 --> 01:01:27,620\nI said that there's a lot that its\none of the things that you're going\n\n1181\n01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:32,100\nto have to be able to do as a pen tester,\nis educate your client on what things they\n\n1182\n01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,240\nshould be testing because a lot of times\nthey don't know what they need tested.\n\n1183\n01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,920\n>> Right, so it might be up to\nus as the penetration tester,\n\n1184\n01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,240\nwhen we get hired by them and\nthey say what we're going to do and\n\n1185\n01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:44,990\nthey're thinking all technical,\ntest my firewalls, test this, test that.\n\n1186\n01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:46,910\nAnd you might be the one that tells them,\nhey, look,\n\n1187\n01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:49,350\nthis is something else that you\nreally have to worry about.\n\n1188\n01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:52,880\nAnd explain to them what kind of\ninformation gets leaked out and\n\n1189\n01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,860\nwhat could be causing it.\n\n1190\n01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,080\nAnd they go, oh, wow, you're right, man.\n\n1191\n01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,790\nWe wanna include that in our testing.\n\n1192\n01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:02,420\n>> Yeah, absolutely, you have to do the\neducation on that, and let them know that\n\n1193\n01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:06,910\nthis is definitely an area that they\nshould seriously consider testing.\n\n1194\n01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:08,680\nI've seen this.\n\n1195\n01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,950\nI've seen social engineering\ndone as an informal test.\n\n1196\n01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:18,610\nI actually know somebody\nback in California that's\n\n1197\n01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:24,238\nway high up, not head of the agency,\nbut he's way high up in it.\n\n1198\n01:02:24,238 --> 01:02:27,260\nAnd when he goes around the state to meet\nwith people in different locations for\n\n1199\n01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:30,440\nthat agency, he says he'll go in and\njust walk right in.\n\n1200\n01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,770\nCuz people don't see him all the time.\n\n1201\n01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,100\nHe's normally up in Sacramento.\n\n1202\n01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:35,890\nWhen he goes to some of those\ndifferent locations he said\n\n1203\n01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,330\nwhen he goes to meet with the IT manager,\n\n1204\n01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:41,140\nwhatever there, he has been known\nto just walk right into the place.\n\n1205\n01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,450\nTo see if anyone stops him,\nbecause he put his ID away.\n\n1206\n01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:49,200\nAnd he says he's had, on more than one\noccasion, he'll call the person and say,\n\n1207\n01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,400\nhey, I'm here waiting for you meeting,\nand then the person will say, okay,\n\n1208\n01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,335\nwhere are you?\n\n1209\n01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:53,985\nI'm in your server room.\n\n1210\n01:02:53,985 --> 01:02:54,704\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1211\n01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:58,055\n>> And he's literally done that.\n\n1212\n01:02:58,055 --> 01:03:05,587\nAnd so something like that,\nis a very good way to test things.\n\n1213\n01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:09,669\nIt's kind of an eye opener,\nso just telling someone,\n\n1214\n01:03:09,669 --> 01:03:13,416\nhey there's a problem\nwith social engineering.\n\n1215\n01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:17,463\nYeah, there's a problem with social\nengineering, someone just walked right in,\n\n1216\n01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:20,090\nand all he was doing was acting\nlike he should be there.\n\n1217\n01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:25,640\nDidn't have an ID on and knew that\nmost people's IDs in most situations,\n\n1218\n01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:30,610\nthose badges that you wear,\nare really just like a security blanket.\n\n1219\n01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:35,630\nI can have a badge on here all I want,\nissue as many badges as I want, but\n\n1220\n01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:37,340\ngo into most work places.\n\n1221\n01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,200\nYou know people don't want it stuck up\nhere they've got it stuck all over their\n\n1222\n01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,605\nbodies, see it's stuck over here,\nstuck under the belt, the pocket.\n\n1223\n01:03:42,605 --> 01:03:45,270\n>> It's not stylish to put it\nup here on my chest right,\n\n1224\n01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:49,380\nI gotta make sure I put it on my belt and\nlook really cool and things like that so.\n\n1225\n01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,923\n>> Yeah, and it not only has to\nbe standardized in my opinion and\n\n1226\n01:03:52,923 --> 01:03:57,590\nmy experience, the best organizations\nstandardized where it should be worn.\n\n1227\n01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:02,569\nSome organizations, you'll see they'll\nbe really blunt about it, it has to be\n\n1228\n01:04:02,569 --> 01:04:07,420\nhere at the nipple line or up, and if\nit's not there, you need to get it there.\n\n1229\n01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,170\nAnd if you have it down here,\nyou're still gonna get stopped.\n\n1230\n01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,490\nAnd they're gonna tell you,\nwhy is it down there?\n\n1231\n01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:13,524\nYou could be detained.\n\n1232\n01:04:13,524 --> 01:04:17,904\nAnd what they're doing is, they're trying\nto make it a habit, since everyone's got\n\n1233\n01:04:17,904 --> 01:04:21,025\nit from here up, everyone's\ngoing to look in the same place.\n\n1234\n01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:23,895\nSo, it makes it a lot easier,\ncuz they realize people just aren't\n\n1235\n01:04:23,895 --> 01:04:27,635\ngonna go through and spend their time\ngoing where's their, where's their ID?\n\n1236\n01:04:27,635 --> 01:04:29,844\n>> They're not gonna scan their\nentire body, or anything like that.\n\n1237\n01:04:29,844 --> 01:04:32,997\nAnd it does come down to, it's amazing,\nyou talk about that guy that's able to\n\n1238\n01:04:32,997 --> 01:04:34,802\njust walk all the way\ninto the server closet.\n\n1239\n01:04:34,802 --> 01:04:39,092\nThat goes back to that user education, and\nteaching people that it's okay to say,\n\n1240\n01:04:39,092 --> 01:04:42,302\nexcuse me, you know,\nthere's proper ways to do it, right?\n\n1241\n01:04:42,302 --> 01:04:43,858\nYou don't say hey, who the heck are you?\n\n1242\n01:04:43,858 --> 01:04:46,220\nBut you could say,\nmay I help you find somebody?\n\n1243\n01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:46,880\nYou know, something.\n\n1244\n01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,818\nSo teaching your users is really the only\nway to prevent social engineering.\n\n1245\n01:04:50,818 --> 01:04:51,812\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1246\n01:04:51,812 --> 01:04:53,660\n>> User education.\n\n1247\n01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:56,148\nA couple other questions I saw out there,\nand\n\n1248\n01:04:56,148 --> 01:04:59,160\nagain we do have a whole\nchapter we're gonna dive in.\n\n1249\n01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,309\nAnd as Sean pointed out,\n\n1250\n01:05:00,309 --> 01:05:03,769\nthis is kinda the high level overview\nof social engineering at this point.\n\n1251\n01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,060\nBut what all does social\nengineering encompass?\n\n1252\n01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,000\nMany things, right?\n\n1253\n01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,680\n>> Oh, yeah, there's a lot of techniques.\n\n1254\n01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,989\nI see, you're mentioning\nstuff like phishing in there,\n\n1255\n01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:17,420\nin one of the questions has mentioned that\nphishing's part of it, but what else?\n\n1256\n01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:19,830\n>> Really, we can break that\nin two high-level categories.\n\n1257\n01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,940\nThere's a way of gathering, doing social\nengineering through technology, and\n\n1258\n01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,710\nthere's social engineering\ndoing things face-to-face.\n\n1259\n01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:31,095\nThe technology is gonna do stuff like\nemail, instant messaging, chat rooms,\n\n1260\n01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:33,157\nI saw someone mention that in there.\n\n1261\n01:05:33,157 --> 01:05:34,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's\n\n1262\n01:05:34,270 --> 01:05:36,050\nplenty of them that you can do that way.\n\n1263\n01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:39,460\nAnd then there's the face-to-face stuff,\nwhere I can walk up to someone and\n\n1264\n01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,430\nstart talking to them and\nusing that to gain information.\n\n1265\n01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:49,430\nA good social engineer can do that in\nsuch a way, and blend in, in such a way,\n\n1266\n01:05:49,430 --> 01:05:52,900\nthat they can really make that\nperson feel that there's a good,\n\n1267\n01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,140\nestablished relationship between them.\n\n1268\n01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:59,080\nAnd get that person to\nstart spilling their guts.\n\n1269\n01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:02,676\nAnd, you'd be surprised at how little\nit takes to establish a level of trust.\n\n1270\n01:06:02,676 --> 01:06:08,477\nHuman beings, if you're able to\nget some sort of common ground,\n\n1271\n01:06:08,477 --> 01:06:12,067\npeople feel more comfortable with you.\n\n1272\n01:06:12,067 --> 01:06:16,386\nIt's that shared experiences,\nshared misery.\n\n1273\n01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:17,908\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1274\n01:06:17,908 --> 01:06:20,916\nMisery loves company, and\nconfidence is another thing, I think,\n\n1275\n01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:23,469\nthat's a big part of a good\nsuccessful social engineer.\n\n1276\n01:06:23,469 --> 01:06:27,082\nJust that ability to, like you said,\nact like he belongs there.\n\n1277\n01:06:27,082 --> 01:06:29,980\n>> Absolutely\n>> And people pick up on that.\n\n1278\n01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,810\nAnd they don't wanna question that,\nbecause they don't want to be wrong.\n\n1279\n01:06:32,810 --> 01:06:34,298\nThey don't wanna be embarrassed.\n\n1280\n01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:37,700\nThey don't wanna get in trouble for\nstopping the wrong person, or\n\n1281\n01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:38,850\nsomething like that.\n\n1282\n01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:42,786\nAnd so, that confidence really lets them\ntake advantage of some of the weaknesses\n\n1283\n01:06:42,786 --> 01:06:44,190\nin human nature.\n\n1284\n01:06:44,190 --> 01:06:48,610\nWe all have those friends that can, what's\nthe old saying, sell snow to an Eskimo.\n\n1285\n01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,488\nAnd those are the guys that are real,\n\n1286\n01:06:50,488 --> 01:06:54,010\ngals that are really good at social\nengineering, because they can.\n\n1287\n01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,160\nThey can talk the talk.\n\n1288\n01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,254\nAnd they can walk the walk.\n\n1289\n01:06:56,254 --> 01:06:59,409\nYeah, absolutely,\nthe better you are at talking to people,\n\n1290\n01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:03,371\nthe more comfortable you are, the better\nyou're probably gonna be at this.\n\n1291\n01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:04,659\nI used to joke around, and\n\n1292\n01:07:04,659 --> 01:07:07,480\nused car salesman would probably\nbe really good at this.\n\n1293\n01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:10,986\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, someone like that, but\n\n1294\n01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:16,260\nif you can keep your cool and\nif you can act really well.\n\n1295\n01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,710\nYou can probably get away\nwith quite a bit here.\n\n1296\n01:07:19,710 --> 01:07:22,020\nSo, it may take some practice for\nyou to use it,\n\n1297\n01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,180\nif you're someone that has trouble\nsaying it in front of people, and\n\n1298\n01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:29,060\nyou start stuttering, and\nyou start kind of like, hold on.\n\n1299\n01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:30,980\nYou know, that type of stuff.\n\n1300\n01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,520\nHey, people have that, right?\n\n1301\n01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:33,730\nNot everyone's cut out for\n\n1302\n01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:37,760\ndoing the face-to-face thing\nin a situation like this.\n\n1303\n01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,770\nIf that's the case, maybe technology.\n\n1304\n01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:41,251\n>> Right, yeah, that's me.\nI mean, I might smile and\n\n1305\n01:07:41,251 --> 01:07:42,716\nI got sweat dripping off of my face.\n\n1306\n01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:45,237\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No, really, I belong here.\n\n1307\n01:07:45,237 --> 01:07:45,830\nWhat?\n\n1308\n01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:49,789\n>> [LAUGH] I got a lot\nof practice as a kid.\n\n1309\n01:07:49,789 --> 01:07:52,350\nBreak something in the house now,\nChris did it.\n\n1310\n01:07:52,350 --> 01:07:54,280\nMy brother?\nYeah, he did it.\n\n1311\n01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,408\nHe wasn't here.\nWell, he did it.\n\n1312\n01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:57,171\nI don't know how he did it,\nthat's not my job.\n\n1313\n01:07:57,171 --> 01:08:01,989\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You'll hear people like\n\n1314\n01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:07,870\nKevin Mitnick, who is really good at this.\n\n1315\n01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:10,220\nPlus others who are really\ngood at social engineering.\n\n1316\n01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:12,108\nThey were actually able\nreally to sell this.\n\n1317\n01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:16,170\nConfidence goes a long, long way.\n\n1318\n01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,007\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1319\n01:08:17,007 --> 01:08:21,470\nI saw a great interview not too\nafter Mitnick got released.\n\n1320\n01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:24,730\nHe did an interview and this guy was\ntalking to him, and he asked him,\n\n1321\n01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:27,230\nthe question was,\nwhat hack were you the most proud of?\n\n1322\n01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:29,675\nAnd of course, Mitnick did the very\npolitically correct thing.\n\n1323\n01:08:29,675 --> 01:08:32,720\nHe's like, well, not that I'm\nproud of any of my attacks, right?\n\n1324\n01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,520\nI mean, I just got out of jail,\nI can't even touch technology yet.\n\n1325\n01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,690\nSo, it's not that I'm proud of any of\nthem, but one of the ones that I was most\n\n1326\n01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:43,200\nsurprised about was when he\ndid some social engineering.\n\n1327\n01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:46,494\nAnd was able to convince, and\nI believe it was Nokia at the time,\n\n1328\n01:08:46,494 --> 01:08:50,520\nwas able to get all their tech specs for\nthis new phone they were developing just\n\n1329\n01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:53,690\nby calling the right people,\ndropping the right names.\n\n1330\n01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:56,660\nHe was able to get them to\nsend all their code for\n\n1331\n01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:58,645\nthis new phone they were developing.\n\n1332\n01:08:58,645 --> 01:09:03,540\nSo, social engineering can be\nextremely powerful you can get\n\n1333\n01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,560\na lot of information if,\nit's done correctly.\n\n1334\n01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:08,755\n>> Yeah, in the right hands,\nthere's a treasure trove of stuff there.\n\n1335\n01:09:08,755 --> 01:09:13,460\nAnd I can guarantee, once you get\nversed in this, and you start seeing\n\n1336\n01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:17,370\nthe stuff that we talk about later,\nyou'll open your eyes a bit more to it.\n\n1337\n01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:23,720\nAnd you'll see just how much can be\nrevealed through social engineering.\n\n1338\n01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,780\nA good social engineer can do a lot.\n\n1339\n01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,970\nAnd remember social engineering,\nI should add in to it,\n\n1340\n01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:33,530\nsocial engineering isn't just\nhow you act and what you say.\n\n1341\n01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:36,125\nIt could also be as simple\nas what you are wearing.\n\n1342\n01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:36,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1343\n01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,134\n>> And, you'll look at someone like\nmyself, yeah, Star Trek shirt and\n\n1344\n01:09:41,134 --> 01:09:42,280\nall that on there.\n\n1345\n01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:43,860\nThat's gonna give a certain impression.\n\n1346\n01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,400\n>> But if you were walking on the bridge,\nI mean, you might fit right in, and\n\n1347\n01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,239\nnobody asks any questions.\n\n1348\n01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:50,496\n>> Yeah, exactly [LAUGH].\n\n1349\n01:09:50,496 --> 01:09:54,000\n>> But it's easy to go get, you can go\ndown to some of the thrift shops and\n\n1350\n01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,910\npick up old uniforms and things like that.\n\n1351\n01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:59,640\nAnd nobody thinks twice about seeing a guy\nin the brown shorts and shirt, right?\n\n1352\n01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:00,440\nAnd things like that.\n\n1353\n01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,160\nYou get a hat, your sister's name plate\non there, or something like that.\n\n1354\n01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,980\nAnd most people aren't\ngoing to think twice.\n\n1355\n01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,880\n>> Yeah, it's a great point.\n\n1356\n01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,765\nSometime just wearing a suit and tie, or\n\n1357\n01:10:09,765 --> 01:10:12,320\nyou have someone that's\ngot a buttoned-down shirt.\n\n1358\n01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,390\nIt's enough to raise your stature\nenough that that person's in a position\n\n1359\n01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:16,330\nof authority.\n\n1360\n01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:21,940\nYou might be able to get into a company\njust by wearing a nice tie and\n\n1361\n01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,080\na pair of slacks.\n\n1362\n01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,000\nAnd people are gonna look at you going,\nokay, well,\n\n1363\n01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,740\nno one just wears that around\njust because, then lets you in.\n\n1364\n01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:31,170\n>> That must be somebody in upper\nmanagement that I just don't know, and\n\n1365\n01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:32,850\nI'm not gonna say anything to him.\n\n1366\n01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:36,520\n>> Yeah,\nit literally could be as simple as that.\n\n1367\n01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,920\nSo, it's just how you dress and then also,\n\n1368\n01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,510\nif you go into a place and\nyou're dressed in a suit and tie,\n\n1369\n01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:46,220\nand that's not their normal attire,\nthat's gonna attract attention, too.\n\n1370\n01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:50,829\nSo, doing a little surveillance and\nfiguring out what typical attire is,\n\n1371\n01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:56,070\nand then adding in stuff like their\nverbiage and their terminology,\n\n1372\n01:10:56,070 --> 01:10:59,490\nstuff they use around there,\nthat can go a long way.\n\n1373\n01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:00,070\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n1374\n01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:01,190\nSean, you're very correct.\n\n1375\n01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:05,650\nSean in the chat room said lingo comes\nin big here, knowing that terminology.\n\n1376\n01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:09,010\nYou might not even be familiar with\nthe terms, but if you can spit them out,\n\n1377\n01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:13,360\nand act like you know what you're\ntalking about, it gets you a long ways.\n\n1378\n01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,930\n>> Yeah, it's never ceased to\namaze me when you look at it.\n\n1379\n01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,490\nIf you haven't seen it,\nI mean you should look at,\n\n1380\n01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:23,760\nif you get a chance, look at movies like,\nCatch Me If You Can.\n\n1381\n01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:28,650\nI mean, we've got someone in there who\nwas an elite level social engineer.\n\n1382\n01:11:28,650 --> 01:11:32,760\nAnd I mean, yeah, there is some artistic\nlicense taken with the movie, but\n\n1383\n01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:38,384\nit's fairly accurate in the stuff\nthat you see people do, in this.\n\n1384\n01:11:38,384 --> 01:11:43,026\nIt's quite fascinating, it's a quite\npowerful tool in your arsenal, and\n\n1385\n01:11:43,026 --> 01:11:47,822\nit's gonna be to your benefit to to use\nit, and to become comfortable with it.\n\n1386\n01:11:47,822 --> 01:11:51,248\nIf you gotta take some acting classes,\nor something like that, I don't know.\n\n1387\n01:11:51,248 --> 01:11:54,264\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you've got to become confident.\n\n1388\n01:11:54,264 --> 01:11:59,249\nAnd you'll find it's pretty easy to\nslip into a certain role, and sell it.\n\n1389\n01:11:59,249 --> 01:12:03,299\nIf you've done your homework, and you've\nreally played along, or you're someone\n\n1390\n01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:06,629\nthat thinks well on your feet,\nyou might be able to do it quite easily.\n\n1391\n01:12:06,629 --> 01:12:09,390\n>> Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1392\n01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:11,200\nAnd as we'll see in our later episodes,\n\n1393\n01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,120\nyou know social engineering it\nmight be the attack itself,\n\n1394\n01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,445\nit might be part of our foot printing and\ngathering Information on our target.\n\n1395\n01:12:18,445 --> 01:12:23,775\nSo, but it could also be the stepping\nstone to another level of our attack too.\n\n1396\n01:12:23,775 --> 01:12:25,025\nSo it could be an attack itself.\n\n1397\n01:12:25,025 --> 01:12:29,185\nIt can be part of a ramping\nup to the actual attack.\n\n1398\n01:12:29,185 --> 01:12:32,292\nSo, very powerful stuff.\n\n1399\n01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:35,132\nSo, you know, we really kinda,\nI don't know what else we wanna say.\n\n1400\n01:12:35,132 --> 01:12:39,782\nWe've talked about what social engineering\nis, some of the different methods,\n\n1401\n01:12:39,782 --> 01:12:42,790\nhow to use it to gather information.\n\n1402\n01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:46,290\nWhen we talk about the dangers\nof social engineering,\n\n1403\n01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:48,200\nwe want to expand on that a little bit?\n\n1404\n01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,450\n>> Yeah, like we said first and\nforemost with social engineering,\n\n1405\n01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:54,322\nthere really is not\na technological solution to it.\n\n1406\n01:12:54,322 --> 01:12:56,170\nAnd there's some ways\ntechnology can help you for\n\n1407\n01:12:56,170 --> 01:13:00,390\nstuff that has been mentioned\nhere about fishing, emails.\n\n1408\n01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,320\nTechnology can kinda help you\nwith that but only to a point.\n\n1409\n01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,440\nIt's only going to help you so much.\n\n1410\n01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:10,970\nIn really comes down to, yes, you have to\ntrain the human element to kind of see if\n\n1411\n01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,770\nthey pick up something's\nout of the ordinary.\n\n1412\n01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,040\nSomething's not quite right, to question.\n\n1413\n01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:19,300\nDon't be vulnerable to\nthings like name dropping.\n\n1414\n01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:22,510\nIf people start doing stuff\nlike name dropping too much,\n\n1415\n01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:24,840\nthey're trying to bull you.\n\n1416\n01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:28,080\nYou know, so\nthat's something to be aware of.\n\n1417\n01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:33,770\nThere's also things like,\nthey can't give you answers to questions.\n\n1418\n01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:38,050\nWhen you question them about this or\nthis, they pause too long or\n\n1419\n01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:39,000\njust get frustrated.\n\n1420\n01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,960\nYou know, things like that are things\nyou got to train people to be aware of.\n\n1421\n01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,980\nBut, social engineering, if done right,\nit's incredibly dangerous.\n\n1422\n01:13:47,980 --> 01:13:49,920\nBecause, it's very hard to detect.\n\n1423\n01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:56,230\nSomeone who can sell that role\ncan be very tough to pick up.\n\n1424\n01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:59,790\nAnd someone who's dressed the right\nway and put everything together,\n\n1425\n01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:04,010\nput the total package together,\ncan really hide in plain sight.\n\n1426\n01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:07,290\nThere was actually something\nI read not too long ago.\n\n1427\n01:14:07,290 --> 01:14:10,260\nThat they had someone\nthat did a PIN test for\n\n1428\n01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:14,160\na bank in southern California, several\nbranches of a bank in southern California.\n\n1429\n01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:18,938\nAnd the way the guy was able to plug\nhis hardware into that bank's network\n\n1430\n01:14:18,938 --> 01:14:22,320\nwas he showed up as someone\nfrom the power company.\n\n1431\n01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,890\nHe just printed out a somewhat\nrealistic looking badge and\n\n1432\n01:14:26,890 --> 01:14:30,840\nput a nice shirt on with jeans and\nsaid, yeah, there's some\n\n1433\n01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,190\nfluctuations in the power grid here,\nso I need to do some monitoring.\n\n1434\n01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:37,430\nHe was actually able to get the bank\npresident to show him around the bank and\n\n1435\n01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:39,230\nhe got into the vault.\n\n1436\n01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:42,835\nHe literally got escorted personally\nby the bank manager into the vault.\n\n1437\n01:14:42,835 --> 01:14:43,470\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1438\n01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:48,130\n>> And the final slap in the face,\nhe plugged in something called a dropbox,\n\n1439\n01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:51,680\nwhich we'll see later on in the course,\nhe was able to\n\n1440\n01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:56,240\nplug a dropbox into an outlet and plugged\nan ethernet connection into it, right, and\n\n1441\n01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:59,250\nhe got the bank manager to do it,\nright behind the bank manager's desk,\n\n1442\n01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:02,420\nand he got her to move out\nof the way when he did.\n\n1443\n01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:05,810\nAnd told them, he says, well, this is\na monitor of the power grid in the area.\n\n1444\n01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,790\nIt's going to send stuff back to me.\n\n1445\n01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:10,260\nHe goes, I'll come pick it up later on.\n\n1446\n01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:14,950\nHe did that to four different banks that\nday in that branch before the company\n\n1447\n01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:18,050\ncalled him and says, we get the point,\njust stop the PIN test right now.\n\n1448\n01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,990\nWe know we have a problem.\n\n1449\n01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:22,290\nThat's how easy it was.\n\n1450\n01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:26,600\nBut if you know, social engineering\nis part of the technology attack, and\n\n1451\n01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,950\nso you can see that someone was able\nto put the two together pretty well.\n\n1452\n01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:34,080\nThink about it,\nthat's a pretty good way to do it.\n\n1453\n01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,370\nYou look like someone from the power\ncompany, you have a badge, and\n\n1454\n01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:41,490\nyou come in with a clipboard and\nall that and plug this little device in.\n\n1455\n01:15:41,490 --> 01:15:44,740\n>> So a couple props,\nthe right attitude, the right knowledge,\n\n1456\n01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:49,210\nbeing able to talk the talk and\nthe confidence.\n\n1457\n01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:50,760\nAnd he basically told them,\n\n1458\n01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,100\nI'm getting ready to take data\noff your network and send it out.\n\n1459\n01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:53,740\nThey're like, okay.\n\n1460\n01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,470\nHere, let me get out of your way and\nyou can plug in.\n\n1461\n01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:57,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> That is amazing.\n\n1462\n01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:58,330\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1463\n01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:03,410\nHe sold that very, very well,\nsold the whole package.\n\n1464\n01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:06,610\nWas able to, instead of just saying, I'm\nhere from, I mean, you could have gone and\n\n1465\n01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:09,800\nsaid, I'm here from the head office,\nor something like that.\n\n1466\n01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:14,790\nNo, he said, I'm here from the bank,\nor from the power company.\n\n1467\n01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:16,710\nI'm here to check the site.\n\n1468\n01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:18,840\nIt made sense.\n\n1469\n01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,360\nSo the guy was like, the reason why I\nwas having the lady show him around was,\n\n1470\n01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,530\nhe was plugging in stuff\ninto different outlets.\n\n1471\n01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:26,830\nI think he had a circuit tester or\nsomething,\n\n1472\n01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:29,510\nsomething you can get at Home Depot for\nlike what?\n\n1473\n01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,622\nTen, 20 bucks?\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1474\n01:16:30,622 --> 01:16:31,995\n>> And it just has colored lights on it,\n\n1475\n01:16:31,995 --> 01:16:34,502\nall it's doing is testing to see\nif that outlet's active or not.\n\n1476\n01:16:34,502 --> 01:16:35,160\n>> Right.\nAnd so,\n\n1477\n01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:36,560\nhe's plugging in going,\nyeah, this one's fine.\n\n1478\n01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,475\nThis one's fine.\n\n1479\n01:16:37,475 --> 01:16:40,390\nUntil he found a good spot\nto plug that dropbox in.\n\n1480\n01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:43,630\nSo, it's literally fascinating.\n\n1481\n01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:46,820\nIt's extremely dangerous\nin the right hands.\n\n1482\n01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:51,360\nIf someone can be very confident and\ncan sell that whole package,\n\n1483\n01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:52,070\nthen they can do it.\n\n1484\n01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:52,900\nAnd think about that.\n\n1485\n01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,098\nIf you're going to use face to\nface form of social engineering,\n\n1486\n01:16:56,098 --> 01:17:00,140\nthey're extremely effective, but\nyou're putting a lot on the line.\n\n1487\n01:17:00,140 --> 01:17:04,770\nThat whole scenario could've turned out\nreally well for the PIN tester, but\n\n1488\n01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:06,520\nit could've turned out really bad, too.\n\n1489\n01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,370\nIf you can't sell that whole thing and\n\n1490\n01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:13,200\nput together a convincing story,\nthis guy's going in face to face.\n\n1491\n01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,830\nThat bank manager is probably asking\nquestions and talking to him.\n\n1492\n01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:16,995\nHe's got to make small talk.\n\n1493\n01:17:16,995 --> 01:17:20,850\nHe's got to be prepared for people in the\nbank to ask him questions that work there.\n\n1494\n01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:24,250\nThere could've been an IT person\nthere too asking them questions.\n\n1495\n01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:29,270\nAnd so he had to be prepared to\nanswer anything and everything and\n\n1496\n01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:30,880\nnot break a sweat.\n\n1497\n01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,960\nIf you're not someone that can do that,\nthen face to\n\n1498\n01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:38,910\nface social engineering is not going to be\nsomething that you're going to want to do.\n\n1499\n01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:41,760\nBecause you could very easily\nin that same situation,\n\n1500\n01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,570\nif you're put into it,\nyou could find yourself in handcuffs and\n\n1501\n01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:49,520\nhaving to explain, going hey, my get out\nof jail free card is in my back pocket.\n\n1502\n01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,805\nYou may have to do something like that.\n\n1503\n01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:55,480\nYou know you may be fine\nat the end of the day, but\n\n1504\n01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:57,805\nit's still kind of an embarrassing\nexperience to go through.\n\n1505\n01:17:57,805 --> 01:18:03,933\nBut nevertheless, in the right hands it\nis very, very, very dangerous to use.\n\n1506\n01:18:03,933 --> 01:18:05,850\n>> All right.\n\n1507\n01:18:05,850 --> 01:18:08,460\nSo, that's our high level\noverview on social engineering.\n\n1508\n01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:13,490\nAgain, we're going to dive much more depth\non social engineering in a later episode.\n\n1509\n01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:17,490\nBut for right now, looking at the clock,\nit's about time for us to take our break.\n\n1510\n01:18:17,490 --> 01:18:19,540\nSo, when we come back we're\ngoing to back into to,\n\n1511\n01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:21,280\nI know I told you we're going\nto get to this at some point,\n\n1512\n01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,280\nSean is going to show us,\nhow do we maintain a low profile?\n\n1513\n01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:27,590\nWe've seen the how easy it\nis to find this information.\n\n1514\n01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:31,190\nThese different tools are just out\nthere with all this social media and\n\n1515\n01:18:31,190 --> 01:18:31,930\nsocial engineering.\n\n1516\n01:18:31,930 --> 01:18:34,540\nSo is there a way we can\nhelp protect ourselves or\n\n1517\n01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:38,240\nteach our users more importantly\nto help protect themselves and\n\n1518\n01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,610\ntherefore the organization\nfrom these types of attacks?\n\n1519\n01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:43,594\nSo stay tuned we'll be back in a few.\n\n1520\n01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:50,014\n[MUSIC]\n\n1521\n01:18:50,014 --> 01:18:52,490\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1522\n01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:56,850\nContinuing on with our footprinting,\nif I can say that, footprinting chapter.\n\n1523\n01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:59,480\nWe're getting ready to talk a little bit\nmore about some of the tools that we can\n\n1524\n01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,210\nuse to do this information gathering.\n\n1525\n01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:07,530\nAs well as our previously promised topic\nof how can I stay under the radar, right?\n\n1526\n01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:11,140\nHow can I prevent some of\nthis from being so easily and\n\n1527\n01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:14,830\nreadily available to the general\npublic with the right tools?\n\n1528\n01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:17,080\nLet's dive right into it,\nwhere do you wanna start?\n\n1529\n01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:19,170\n>> All right.\nWell the first thing I want to start off\n\n1530\n01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:23,050\nwith is I want to take a look\nat one of the ways that,\n\n1531\n01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,960\nI know some of you are aware of,\nbut not everyone's aware of it and\n\n1532\n01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:32,810\nI figured I'd just kind of demo it here,\nis something called geotagging,\n\n1533\n01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:38,200\nor what they more generically call XF\ndata, which is stored in an image.\n\n1534\n01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,250\nWhat I have here is I have an image,\nas you can see.\n\n1535\n01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,539\nIt's Sydney Opera House.\n\n1536\n01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,205\nLooks, it's a fairly decent picture or\nanything.\n\n1537\n01:19:47,205 --> 01:19:49,460\nI'm not being a critic or\nanything, right.?\n\n1538\n01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:52,612\nLike, well I don't know if this is\ncentered quite right, but it'll pass.\n\n1539\n01:19:52,612 --> 01:19:54,522\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think normally we want to go\n\n1540\n01:19:54,522 --> 01:19:57,874\nwith our thirds model, and that horizon\nline should actually be about and\n\n1541\n01:19:57,874 --> 01:20:01,625\ninch lower then that, but other then that\nit's pretty good well framed picture.\n\n1542\n01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:06,710\n>> Yeah we're kind of doing it you know\nso, but what I wanna take a look at here\n\n1543\n01:20:06,710 --> 01:20:11,714\nis I want to look at this image and\nit doesn't look that bad It's probably\n\n1544\n01:20:11,714 --> 01:20:16,255\na type of image someone might post\non Facebook or another source.\n\n1545\n01:20:16,255 --> 01:20:20,696\nNow, so I've got this picture up here,\nso what is Exif data?\n\n1546\n01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:24,434\nExif data is stuff stored in the image or\na file,\n\n1547\n01:20:24,434 --> 01:20:27,341\nyou could say generically that way.\n\n1548\n01:20:27,341 --> 01:20:30,310\nBut Exif data in this case,\nwe see an image and\n\n1549\n01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:34,930\nit's stuff that comes from the device\nthat the device that's taking the picture\n\n1550\n01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:37,810\nwill typically embed in that image.\n\n1551\n01:20:37,810 --> 01:20:40,580\nSo you see this image here,\nit doesn't look bad.\n\n1552\n01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:45,230\nSomeone's looking at it, but for us when\nwe're doing our footprinting process,\n\n1553\n01:20:45,230 --> 01:20:48,020\nthere's tools out there that\nwe can get an image and\n\n1554\n01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:52,020\nwe could run it through an Exif viewer,\nand this is one of many Exif viewers.\n\n1555\n01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:53,880\nYou actually can get this for\nyour cell phone, too.\n\n1556\n01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,970\nThere's Exif viewers in the Android Store,\nyou can just type it in.\n\n1557\n01:20:57,970 --> 01:21:02,790\nSo, what I've done is I've gone ahead and\nset this up by taking the image, which I\n\n1558\n01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:06,900\nhave stored on my hard drive, of course,\nand browsed to it and loaded it in here.\n\n1559\n01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:11,330\nAnd, so\nnow I'm able to view that Exif data.\n\n1560\n01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:16,250\nNow, if you look at it, you see stuff like\ncaption, who took it, the camera, okay?\n\n1561\n01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,200\n>> Wow.\n>> So, we've got camera information,\n\n1562\n01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,550\nwhether or not they used a flash.\n\n1563\n01:21:20,550 --> 01:21:23,300\nYou've got stuff like that, date.\n\n1564\n01:21:23,300 --> 01:21:26,420\nBut then you get down there, and you see,\nhey, it's got location information.\n\n1565\n01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,160\nWell, someone had their GPS turned on,\nwe know when they were doing this.\n\n1566\n01:21:31,160 --> 01:21:35,230\nAnd the GPS embedded that\nstuff into the image.\n\n1567\n01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,774\nSo that's kind of the concern.\n\n1568\n01:21:36,774 --> 01:21:41,222\nWhen you start looking at a site like\nthis, a site like this takes the image and\n\n1569\n01:21:41,222 --> 01:21:44,430\nthen will actually read it in and\ngeolocate that.\n\n1570\n01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:47,780\nSo what we can tell is this\nperson took this picture.\n\n1571\n01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:51,280\nIt looks like they were sitting on\na boat or ferry, something like that,\n\n1572\n01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,990\nsome type of water craft.\n\n1573\n01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:54,498\nI'd hope it was in some\nsort of water craft,\n\n1574\n01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:57,950\nweren't bobbing around with a life\nvest going click, somebody help me.\n\n1575\n01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:59,472\n>> They're walking on water.\n\n1576\n01:21:59,472 --> 01:22:01,180\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, so\n\n1577\n01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:05,400\nthey've got a picture,\nyou can see exactly where it is.\n\n1578\n01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:12,670\nNow, I see over here that James is\nsaying Facebook will strip this info.\n\n1579\n01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:17,160\nYeah, that's a good point, James,\nis that if you were to upload this stuff\n\n1580\n01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:22,350\nto many of these imaging hosting websites,\nthey do and they manipulate the image.\n\n1581\n01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:26,170\nOne of the things they can do is\nthey'll remove some of this data so.\n\n1582\n01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,535\n>> Sometimes, thought, that's an option\nthat you may have to pick, right?\n\n1583\n01:22:29,535 --> 01:22:32,720\nWhether you want to include\nyour geolocation information.\n\n1584\n01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:36,038\nAnd then even other sites actually go the\nopposite and they display it, Flickr and\n\n1585\n01:22:36,038 --> 01:22:36,807\nplaces like that,\n\n1586\n01:22:36,807 --> 01:22:39,860\nI mean, you want to see that data cuz\nit does have a useful purpose, right?\n\n1587\n01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:43,270\nIt shows me things like the camera\nthey used, and the exposures, and\n\n1588\n01:22:43,270 --> 01:22:44,630\nthe lenses and stuff like that.\n\n1589\n01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,370\nSo if I wanted to try to recreate that or\nlearn from that,\n\n1590\n01:22:47,370 --> 01:22:49,300\nI can with that information.\n\n1591\n01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:52,300\nBut in this picture here,\nit's the Sydney Opera House.\n\n1592\n01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:55,099\nSo we're pretty sure they took it\nfrom somewhere around Sydney, right?\n\n1593\n01:22:55,099 --> 01:22:59,170\nBut where we start to see, I think,\nthe power of this is these pictures\n\n1594\n01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:02,965\nthat people are taking with their\nphones and stuff like that, and\n\n1595\n01:23:02,965 --> 01:23:07,602\nit's just a group of people at a party or\nat a conference or something like that.\n\n1596\n01:23:07,602 --> 01:23:10,525\nAnd that's when this information,\nall of the sudden, it's like, whoa,\n\n1597\n01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:13,128\nI didn't realize I was letting\neverybody know exactly where I was,\n\n1598\n01:23:13,128 --> 01:23:15,430\nwho I was with, what time it was taken,\nand all that stuff.\n\n1599\n01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,110\nIt can get kinda dangerous.\n\n1600\n01:23:17,110 --> 01:23:20,360\n>> Oh yeah, it can become very,\nvery dangerous when you get down to it.\n\n1601\n01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,840\nWhen you look at an image like this, and\n\n1602\n01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,540\nmaybe someone's putting it up on their\nwebsite and it's not getting manipulated.\n\n1603\n01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,440\nIn fact, some of these things\nlike Instagram, and Flickr, and\n\n1604\n01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,330\nall of these other ones,\nthey give an option.\n\n1605\n01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:35,440\nYou can set it sometimes to these sites\nwhere it'll say, do you want me to\n\n1606\n01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:40,220\nreadjust or manipulate this image somehow,\nor do you want me to leave it as is?\n\n1607\n01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:43,660\nAnd if you say leave it as is, sometimes\nit will just leave everything intact.\n\n1608\n01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:44,520\nThat's what it's supposed to do.\n\n1609\n01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,550\nYou're telling it to do that.\n\n1610\n01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:49,670\nAnd people are getting more savvy\nabout knowing this stuff here.\n\n1611\n01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:54,880\nIt used to be just a handful of years ago,\neven when this stuff still existed,\n\n1612\n01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,330\nI would tell people about geo tagging or\nhaving this data in there and\n\n1613\n01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:03,910\nthey were kind of just amazed, and\nnow more people are aware of it.\n\n1614\n01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:08,410\nSo if you leave this stuff in,\nsomeone could very well look for it.\n\n1615\n01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:11,370\nLike I said, you can get these\nthings on your cell phone,\n\n1616\n01:24:11,370 --> 01:24:14,960\nyou see a website right here,\nthere's utilities that do this.\n\n1617\n01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,160\nSo it is something to definitely be\naware of and it can get dangerous.\n\n1618\n01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:25,410\nI've definitely heard of, this is a little\nkind of an extreme situation, but I've\n\n1619\n01:24:25,410 --> 01:24:30,620\nheard cases where people took pictures\nof a location they were staying in.\n\n1620\n01:24:30,620 --> 01:24:33,830\nAnd all of a sudden, they have someone\ntrying to rob them or kidnap them or\n\n1621\n01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:35,810\nsomething like that cuz\nnow we know where you are.\n\n1622\n01:24:35,810 --> 01:24:40,580\n>> Absolutely, or even, I get some\nwaiter to take a picture of me and\n\n1623\n01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:42,850\nmy family at this restaurant in Hawaii.\n\n1624\n01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:43,560\nWell, guess what?\n\n1625\n01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,820\nIf your entire family's in Hawaii,\nthen who's at your house?\n\n1626\n01:24:45,820 --> 01:24:46,800\nProbably nobody, right?\n\n1627\n01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,370\n>> There you go.\n>> So there's a good time to try to break\n\n1628\n01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,730\ninto your house and things like that.\n\n1629\n01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:53,570\nAnd so can definitely get you in trouble\nand it's just something you might not even\n\n1630\n01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:56,280\nthink about or\nmost people don't think about.\n\n1631\n01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:00,410\nLuckily, it is starting to get more and\nmore, I won't say recognition but\n\n1632\n01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:04,160\npeople are becoming more aware of it and\nmaybe a little more careful about it.\n\n1633\n01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:10,020\n>> Yeah, and I don't want to give the\nimpression that having GPS coordinates and\n\n1634\n01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:12,170\nstuff like this in an image is bad.\n\n1635\n01:25:12,170 --> 01:25:15,750\nI mean, as you alluded to, I might want\nto see, hey, that's a great image.\n\n1636\n01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:18,150\nHow can I get that same result?\n\n1637\n01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:23,080\nGPS coordinates are also\nuseful in images like\n\n1638\n01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:27,120\nI know I've done search and rescue, been\non flight crews and stuff like that, and\n\n1639\n01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:32,650\nwhen you have someone in the back of the\naircraft taking a picture of locations,\n\n1640\n01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:36,540\nthings that they think that might be and\nyou document this.\n\n1641\n01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:40,430\nHaving those coordinates embedded in is\na lot more accurate than having someone do\n\n1642\n01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:42,450\nit the old-fashioned way where they\nhad to write it on a notepad and\n\n1643\n01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:46,300\nsay what was the place on the map.\n\n1644\n01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,130\nYou know,\nI know exactly where the image was taken.\n\n1645\n01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:50,400\n>> It was taken right at that time and\nthen you got it.\n\n1646\n01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:53,550\n>> It alleviates some of the burden that\nthe flight crew has to remember this.\n\n1647\n01:25:55,630 --> 01:25:57,170\n>> Yeah, so a lot of information, and\n\n1648\n01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:59,790\nagain, it's just another one of those\nthings when we talk about social media,\n\n1649\n01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:02,950\npeople are not aware of what\nthey're sharing, you know?\n\n1650\n01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,300\nAnd this is something that they mostly,\nagain,\n\n1651\n01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,980\nthey're not aware because\nthey're posting this picture.\n\n1652\n01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:10,980\nThey're not even thinking about all the\nhidden data that's being stored with that\n\n1653\n01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:15,358\nimage that they could potentially\nbe sharing out as well.\n\n1654\n01:26:15,358 --> 01:26:17,722\nAnother thing, and for\nus, for a hacking process,\n\n1655\n01:26:17,722 --> 01:26:19,779\nit's another source of great information.\n\n1656\n01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:23,006\nWhen we're doing our footprinting,\nremember, we're trying to gather all this\n\n1657\n01:26:23,006 --> 01:26:24,828\ninformation and\nbring it in and then later on,\n\n1658\n01:26:24,828 --> 01:26:27,793\nwe're gonna determine what's relevant and\nwhat we use in our next phase.\n\n1659\n01:26:27,793 --> 01:26:31,694\nBut this is just another chunk of\nthe data that we can start to gather up.\n\n1660\n01:26:31,694 --> 01:26:34,196\n>> Yeah, always remember information is,\n\n1661\n01:26:34,196 --> 01:26:37,058\nas I like to say,\ninformation's ammunition.\n\n1662\n01:26:37,058 --> 01:26:41,361\nIt's something that you can\nuse to carry the battle,\n\n1663\n01:26:41,361 --> 01:26:44,138\nif you want, on to the next point.\n\n1664\n01:26:44,138 --> 01:26:48,176\nYou know, so, as much information as you\ncan get, maybe stuff like this doesn't\n\n1665\n01:26:48,176 --> 01:26:52,330\nmake much sense now to pull something\nlike this off an image, for example.\n\n1666\n01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:55,425\nBut maybe later on,\nyou're pulling additional image and\n\n1667\n01:26:55,425 --> 01:26:58,875\nyou're pulling location stuff,\nlike physical address locations.\n\n1668\n01:26:58,875 --> 01:27:03,302\nAnd you're kinda wondering, well,\nyou see a picture of a person or\n\n1669\n01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:07,124\na facility and you're like well,\nwhere exactly is that?\n\n1670\n01:27:07,124 --> 01:27:09,941\nWell, maybe you can look to see\nwhere those offices are and\n\n1671\n01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:13,869\ncross reference it with the stuff there\nand say, okay, that's what's there.\n\n1672\n01:27:13,869 --> 01:27:18,095\nYou know, so it may not seem right up\nfront those little goodies you find may\n\n1673\n01:27:18,095 --> 01:27:21,517\nnot be readily obvious that\nthey're gonna be useful, but,\n\n1674\n01:27:21,517 --> 01:27:23,390\nthey very well can be later on.\n\n1675\n01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:25,260\nYou can have a eureka moment, right?\n\n1676\n01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,215\n>> [LAUGH] Yep.\n\n1677\n01:27:26,215 --> 01:27:28,920\nAll right, so good information there.\n\n1678\n01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,250\nAnother tool I think that we were\ntalking about in the break was this one,\n\n1679\n01:27:32,250 --> 01:27:33,980\nand I'll say it wrong, Maltego?\n\n1680\n01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:36,372\n>> Maltego, yep.\n>> Maltego, another good one.\n\n1681\n01:27:36,372 --> 01:27:38,550\nWe're gonna take a peek at that one,\nI think.\n\n1682\n01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:42,340\n>> Yes, Maltego, is just to kind of\ndo the set up on this, Maltego is\n\n1683\n01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:48,010\none I'm gonna demo for you here, and\nI'm gonna do the quick and dirty demo.\n\n1684\n01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:51,720\nLet me tell you why we would\nuse something like Maltego.\n\n1685\n01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,674\nMaltego is a utility that\nactually speeds up the process of\n\n1686\n01:27:56,674 --> 01:27:59,919\ndoing footprinting substantially.\n\n1687\n01:27:59,919 --> 01:28:03,430\nIt is designed to help you not\njust get the information but\n\n1688\n01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:08,423\nalso to visualize it too, cuz sometimes\nyou're gonna get a lot of information.\n\n1689\n01:28:08,423 --> 01:28:13,090\nIt's kind of hard to visualize\nthe relationships that you have.\n\n1690\n01:28:13,090 --> 01:28:15,920\nSo a tool like this can\ndefinitely help you out.\n\n1691\n01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:22,080\nAnd I'm going to put a little disclaimer\nI guess is what they call it here.\n\n1692\n01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:23,460\nThere's two versions of this.\n\n1693\n01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:26,391\nThere's the community version,\nwhich any of you can get.\n\n1694\n01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:32,666\nYou could go up to Paterva's site right\nnow and grab it, you can get that for\n\n1695\n01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:39,390\nfree, or you can get the paid version\nwhich costs some amount of money.\n\n1696\n01:28:39,390 --> 01:28:41,300\nThis one I'm using here\nis the full version.\n\n1697\n01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:44,686\nThe folks at Paterva actually\nprovided this to me.\n\n1698\n01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:50,573\nSo, because I was using it and trying\nit out and they said well, here you go.\n\n1699\n01:28:50,573 --> 01:28:53,590\nI'm just kidding, I got off BitTorrent.\n\n1700\n01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:54,833\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, no, I'm kidding, no.\n\n1701\n01:28:54,833 --> 01:28:56,784\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Oops!\n\n1702\n01:28:56,784 --> 01:28:59,047\n>> No, seriously, no,\nno, they gave it to me.\n\n1703\n01:28:59,047 --> 01:29:01,091\n>> Arrrr!\n\n1704\n01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:06,250\n[LAUGH]\n>> But the thing is here\n\n1705\n01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:11,296\nis what I'm gonna do is I'm going\nto show you what this can do.\n\n1706\n01:29:11,296 --> 01:29:13,862\nThe community version\nwill get information, but\n\n1707\n01:29:13,862 --> 01:29:16,400\nit won't go to the level\nthat this one will.\n\n1708\n01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,635\nBut you'll get a good\nidea of what's going on.\n\n1709\n01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:23,883\nWell, the way this works is it\nhas a wizard interface, but\n\n1710\n01:29:23,883 --> 01:29:29,850\nit also has an interface where you can\nkind of lay out the stuff that you want.\n\n1711\n01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:32,670\nTo make things easy here I'm\njust gonna start the wizard.\n\n1712\n01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:36,532\nSo we can get into it and you can kinda\nsee without me just doing a long lecture\n\n1713\n01:29:36,532 --> 01:29:38,753\non, a tutorial on how to use this, right.\n\n1714\n01:29:38,753 --> 01:29:40,450\n>> Does that first one say creepy stalker?\n\n1715\n01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:41,130\n>> Company stalker.\n\n1716\n01:29:41,130 --> 01:29:42,255\n>> Oh, okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1717\n01:29:42,255 --> 01:29:43,187\n>> No, I'm the creepy stalker.\n\n1718\n01:29:43,187 --> 01:29:44,412\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1719\n01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:50,300\nI could feel eyes in the back of\nmy head from the crew back there.\n\n1720\n01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:56,600\nBut, so if I select these things, like\nif I do the company stalker it's going\n\n1721\n01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:59,900\nto ask me when I click Next,\nit's gonna say, what's the domain name?\n\n1722\n01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:06,560\nSo if I choose a domain name,\nlike I could do our itpro.tv website.\n\n1723\n01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,730\nI click Finish, and\nit's gonna take a moment or\n\n1724\n01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:13,910\ntwo, and it will go ahead and\nscan that site.\n\n1725\n01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:20,330\nAnd what happens is that, are we scanning\nit right here, it'll take a little time.\n\n1726\n01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:22,080\nOkay, there we go.\n\n1727\n01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:29,140\nSo, it's gonna go out and try to inquire\non that site and get information.\n\n1728\n01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,040\nAnd it's actually pretty neat.\n\n1729\n01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:33,000\nSo you can see right here,\nit's put a little pinwheel up.\n\n1730\n01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,640\nIt's actually looking, and following\nlinks and seeing what data it can mine.\n\n1731\n01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,250\n>> It's starting with a domain name,\n\n1732\n01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:42,500\nand then kinda doing a lot of the things\nwe might have done with all the individual\n\n1733\n01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:45,440\ntools, but\nit's in the background doing it for us.\n\n1734\n01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,290\nYeah, exactly.\n\n1735\n01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:52,430\nAnd you can see I just switched over and\nyou can see what it did.\n\n1736\n01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:57,010\nIf I I hit proceed it's gonna\ninclude some more stuff.\n\n1737\n01:30:57,010 --> 01:30:59,160\nI'm not touching anything,\nit's doing that for me.\n\n1738\n01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,985\nSo that query's still running.\n\n1739\n01:31:01,985 --> 01:31:06,030\nSo, looks like this query's done.\n\n1740\n01:31:06,030 --> 01:31:09,290\nDoesn't look like a lot, but\nwhen you get down to it,\n\n1741\n01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:13,070\nand I'll kind of pan this over and center\nthis a bit, it's like what do we have?\n\n1742\n01:31:13,070 --> 01:31:17,104\nWe have some emails there, and\nI don't know if those emails are valid or\n\n1743\n01:31:17,104 --> 01:31:20,141\nanything like that, but\nwe have some emails in here.\n\n1744\n01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:22,359\nAnd then we see some other\nstuff down here at the bottom.\n\n1745\n01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:26,642\nIt's looking down here, it's showing\nsome relationship information down here.\n\n1746\n01:31:26,642 --> 01:31:28,560\nBut then, what if you want to go further?\n\n1747\n01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,630\nLet's talk about that footprinting part.\n\n1748\n01:31:30,630 --> 01:31:32,860\nWhat type of stuff do we get\nduring footprinting so far?\n\n1749\n01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:35,660\nWe did website info, DNS info.\n\n1750\n01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:36,773\n>> Couple IP addresses.\n\n1751\n01:31:36,773 --> 01:31:39,080\n>> Mail servers, IP addresses.\n\n1752\n01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,160\nLet's see what we can do here for that.\n\n1753\n01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:45,760\nYou can right-click on this domain\nname and I can say run transform.\n\n1754\n01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,970\nA transform is something that\nyou run on an entity, an object,\n\n1755\n01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:54,980\nin this software and\nit runs a query of your choosing.\n\n1756\n01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:56,530\nNow I could choose to run them all, but\n\n1757\n01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:59,640\nthat's gonna take just\na big amount of time.\n\n1758\n01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:03,174\nWhat I can do is I can say,\nokay I want to see,\n\n1759\n01:32:03,174 --> 01:32:07,103\nlet me just do the transform for\nDNS to a website.\n\n1760\n01:32:07,103 --> 01:32:09,900\nIt's gonna scan it and\nsee what it can find.\n\n1761\n01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:11,000\nSo it's got a domain name.\n\n1762\n01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:16,960\nIt's going up scanning this right now,\nand it popped it out right away.\n\n1763\n01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:21,341\nSo it's saying these are the things,\nI mean, you can see the main ITProTV site,\n\n1764\n01:32:21,341 --> 01:32:23,540\nand then join, and dev IT, and forums.\n\n1765\n01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:27,470\nSo it went through and says okay, this\nhas these things sitting underneath it.\n\n1766\n01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:32,050\nIf I want to go to the IT Pro site I can\nright-click on that and see transform and\n\n1767\n01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:36,630\nsay Resove to IP, and say give me the IP\naddress for it, save the IP address and\n\n1768\n01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:39,760\nit's gonna do a quick scan on that and\nboom!\n\n1769\n01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:43,030\nIt's got the IP addresses tied to that.\n\n1770\n01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:44,390\nIf that's not good enough for\n\n1771\n01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:49,160\nyou, you can even do transforms in here to\nsay, I mean there's a whole bunch of them.\n\n1772\n01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:53,753\nYou can go to transforms, and I'm kind\nof a little skittish today with this.\n\n1773\n01:32:53,753 --> 01:32:56,770\nYou can say to natural boundaries.\n\n1774\n01:32:57,830 --> 01:33:01,660\nIt scans a bit more and\nlet me pan down in there, what did it do?\n\n1775\n01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:02,878\nIt pulled the net block up.\n\n1776\n01:33:02,878 --> 01:33:05,806\n[SOUND] That was slick.\n\n1777\n01:33:05,806 --> 01:33:09,193\n>> Yeah, you're seeing a few steps,\nyou're seeing that mining data very,\n\n1778\n01:33:09,193 --> 01:33:09,902\nvery quickly.\n\n1779\n01:33:09,902 --> 01:33:15,070\nAnd I can go much,\nmuch further than that, trust me.\n\n1780\n01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:15,974\nI can right-click on something up here.\n\n1781\n01:33:15,974 --> 01:33:16,880\n>> Oh no, we do, we believe you.\n\n1782\n01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:19,284\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Don't make me use this!\n\n1783\n01:33:19,284 --> 01:33:20,084\n>> As David asked,\n\n1784\n01:33:20,084 --> 01:33:24,480\ndid ITProTV contract with Sean to find all\nthe vulnerabilities before the episodes?\n\n1785\n01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,285\nNo, we didn't.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1786\n01:33:25,285 --> 01:33:26,915\n>> We're finding out about them live\n\n1787\n01:33:26,915 --> 01:33:27,675\nwith you guys.\n\n1788\n01:33:27,675 --> 01:33:28,500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1789\n01:33:28,500 --> 01:33:31,322\nthere's people back there taking\na written transcript right now.\n\n1790\n01:33:31,322 --> 01:33:33,217\nThey were like oh, we've gotta do this.\n\n1791\n01:33:33,217 --> 01:33:35,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Everything we discover,\n\n1792\n01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:37,967\nthey're back there madly trying to\nfix before you guys try to find it.\n\n1793\n01:33:37,967 --> 01:33:39,250\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, keep in mind,\n\n1794\n01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:44,020\nthis isn't finding vulnerabilities at all,\nit's just mapping things out.\n\n1795\n01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:44,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n1796\n01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:49,690\n>> So, it's stuff that you\ncould do against it right now.\n\n1797\n01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:52,490\n>> You talked about\ndocumentation the other day and\n\n1798\n01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:55,700\nsome of those other tools that we do,\nwe're getting a lot of information back in\n\n1799\n01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:57,940\na command prompt format and\nthings like that.\n\n1800\n01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:58,920\nThis is pretty handy.\n\n1801\n01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,090\nI've got a nice pretty picture.\n\n1802\n01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:04,330\nThis is something that you can maybe turn\nin as a reportable for my first phase.\n\n1803\n01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:05,797\n>> You definitely could.\n\n1804\n01:34:05,797 --> 01:34:09,431\nThe beauty of something like this is\nyou can click on these things and\n\n1805\n01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:12,140\nit will generate them\nin different formats.\n\n1806\n01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:15,500\nSo it establishes the relationships,\nit can do something like this,\n\n1807\n01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:16,560\ndo a bubble view.\n\n1808\n01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:19,930\nWhich gives you kind of a bigger view\nof how things relate, the universe.\n\n1809\n01:34:19,930 --> 01:34:24,500\nOr you can do the main view which\nshows you the actual entities.\n\n1810\n01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:29,102\n>> And to see that I'm going in as a pen\ntester trying to sell my business,\n\n1811\n01:34:29,102 --> 01:34:32,300\nthis is an impressive\npiece of technology here.\n\n1812\n01:34:32,300 --> 01:34:36,050\n>> Yeah and it's amazing what this can do.\n\n1813\n01:34:36,050 --> 01:34:40,340\nJust to show you some other stuff in here,\nsome of these other transforms.\n\n1814\n01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:43,200\nHere's something that you wanna see,\nthe server,\n\n1815\n01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,420\nthe technologies being used on the server.\n\n1816\n01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,771\nI mean, we did that, right?\n\n1817\n01:34:46,771 --> 01:34:48,365\n>> Yes.\n>> We were determining that.\n\n1818\n01:34:48,365 --> 01:34:49,778\nI ran a transform,\n\n1819\n01:34:49,778 --> 01:34:54,910\nthere is all the technologies\ncurrently being used on that website.\n\n1820\n01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:57,213\nQueried it, and it says boom,\nhere you go, here's what I found.\n\n1821\n01:34:57,213 --> 01:35:00,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> So in a few clicks,\n\n1822\n01:35:00,790 --> 01:35:04,530\nI mean we just spent what,\nthe last day and a half doing this stuff?\n\n1823\n01:35:04,530 --> 01:35:05,740\n>> Right.\n\n1824\n01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:11,450\n>> All right, I've done this in front of\nyour eyes, live, in just a few moments.\n\n1825\n01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:13,686\n>> Now I've got a good question\nin the chat room there.\n\n1826\n01:35:13,686 --> 01:35:15,360\nFabian has asked us,\nif we're inside the network,\n\n1827\n01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:20,860\nhow would the results differ\nif we did something like, I'm\n\n1828\n01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:25,210\ntrying to think of something that we could\ntry on the outside, Newegg or Best Buy.\n\n1829\n01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:28,198\n>> I don't know,\nwhat's your website Fabian?\n\n1830\n01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:31,466\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, Fabian, give us your URL,\nwe'll find out what we can find.\n\n1831\n01:35:31,466 --> 01:35:34,783\n[LAUGH] But again, really, this stuff,\nI don't know that it has that much to do\n\n1832\n01:35:34,783 --> 01:35:37,670\nwith being on the inside,\nbecause there's the same kind of thing.\n\n1833\n01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:38,426\n>> It really doesn't.\n\n1834\n01:35:38,426 --> 01:35:42,295\n>> We're getting that publicly available\ninformation that almost has to be out\n\n1835\n01:35:42,295 --> 01:35:45,627\nthere for everything to work and\nfor people to find my website, for\n\n1836\n01:35:45,627 --> 01:35:47,370\nyou guys to watch these episodes.\n\n1837\n01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:51,100\nSo it's not information that we're\nbroadcasting and putting on a billboard,\n\n1838\n01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:51,950\nbut it is out there.\n\n1839\n01:35:53,060 --> 01:36:00,890\n>> Yeah, it's absolutely, it's really just\nto kind of answer your question Fabian,\n\n1840\n01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:05,131\nthis would not really\nchange that much at all,\n\n1841\n01:36:05,131 --> 01:36:09,170\nif at all,\nif you were doing it externally.\n\n1842\n01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:10,880\nIt would be the same thing.\n\n1843\n01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,942\nI mean if you get down to it and\nlook at all the stuff I've done here,\n\n1844\n01:36:13,942 --> 01:36:16,800\nThis isn't anything you couldn't\nhave done from your side.\n\n1845\n01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,090\nNot a single thing you couldn't\nhave done from your side.\n\n1846\n01:36:19,090 --> 01:36:22,518\n>> It's hitting the registrars and getting\nour IP address blocks, it's talking about\n\n1847\n01:36:22,518 --> 01:36:26,450\nweb server and fingerprinting the OS and\nthings like that, getting us IP addresses.\n\n1848\n01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:29,070\nIt's just nice and graphical and\nputting it out there.\n\n1849\n01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:33,269\nAnd it does give me, as a company, this\nmight be something I use to go wow, I need\n\n1850\n01:36:33,269 --> 01:36:37,970\nto look at ways that I might be able to\nobfuscate some of this information, right?\n\n1851\n01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:39,860\nAnd maybe make it not so easy to find.\n\n1852\n01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:44,598\n>> Yeah, and this can get pretty\naggressive in what it does,\n\n1853\n01:36:44,598 --> 01:36:47,219\nwhich may be kinda scary to you.\n\n1854\n01:36:47,219 --> 01:36:49,193\nI mean that's a real lot of information,\nright?\n\n1855\n01:36:49,193 --> 01:36:55,950\nI'll close this one and\njust show you a different query.\n\n1856\n01:36:55,950 --> 01:36:59,010\nI can run this one called a Footprint L3.\n\n1857\n01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:02,400\nIt specifically has something called for\nfootprinting in there.\n\n1858\n01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,525\n>> Wow.\n>> If I type in itpro.tv for this one and\n\n1859\n01:37:06,525 --> 01:37:12,080\nhit OK, it's gonna do some more scans\nasking me are these things fine for\n\n1860\n01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,820\nme to include in the search?\n\n1861\n01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:18,710\nAnd I'll say yes, I'll just click through\nand say, go ahead, rock and roll.\n\n1862\n01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:21,455\nAnd it will keep going.\n\n1863\n01:37:21,455 --> 01:37:23,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not touching anything.\n\n1864\n01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:30,927\nI'm saying just include anything, and\nit's just drilling right on down.\n\n1865\n01:37:30,927 --> 01:37:36,625\nI mean yeah, that's a mess, but I am not,\nI wouldn't probably want all that\n\n1866\n01:37:36,625 --> 01:37:41,715\nnormally, but I just said,\nhey let's see how far we can take this.\n\n1867\n01:37:41,715 --> 01:37:45,805\nAnd it's just going boom\nright on down the list.\n\n1868\n01:37:45,805 --> 01:37:48,395\nAnd kind of what we're\nseeing right now is,\n\n1869\n01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:54,035\nwe could have a situation where\nwe have like a shared server\n\n1870\n01:37:54,035 --> 01:37:57,925\nwhere there's other sites being hosted\nin that net block, or on that server.\n\n1871\n01:37:57,925 --> 01:37:59,415\nIt could be something like that, and\n\n1872\n01:37:59,415 --> 01:38:02,630\nthat's why, I mean, it's still going,\n[LAUGH] it's still going.\n\n1873\n01:38:02,630 --> 01:38:07,020\nI'm not touching anything,\nit's just going right on down the list.\n\n1874\n01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:08,460\n>> And we talked about that earlier, too.\n\n1875\n01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:11,550\nWhere sometimes you gotta be careful\nwhere these tools might pull back.\n\n1876\n01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:14,520\nYou're looking trying to get a specific\nrange or a specific organization,\n\n1877\n01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,520\nand the tool maybe goes a little too\naggressive and get some other stuff.\n\n1878\n01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,656\nAnd if you're not paying attention,\nyou start clicking on some of that other\n\n1879\n01:38:20,656 --> 01:38:22,790\nthings that's not your target,\nand it is the NSA.\n\n1880\n01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:26,260\nOr that's a little extreme, but you now,\nsomething like that where you don't have\n\n1881\n01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:30,980\npermission to be doing what you're doing,\nand you start getting in trouble.\n\n1882\n01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:34,490\nFabian's website, he says is the NSA.org.\n\n1883\n01:38:34,490 --> 01:38:37,570\nSo, I don't know if we want to [LAUGH].\n\n1884\n01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:39,540\nNice try, Fabian.\n\n1885\n01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:40,180\n>> Watch this.\n\n1886\n01:38:40,180 --> 01:38:42,085\nI'm gonna register\nthe search under your name.\n\n1887\n01:38:42,085 --> 01:38:46,210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not so funny now, is it?\n\n1888\n01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:49,410\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1889\n01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:51,420\n>> But you saw,\n\n1890\n01:38:51,420 --> 01:38:53,110\nand I'm gonna zoom out here.\n\n1891\n01:38:55,735 --> 01:38:58,855\nAll those little bubbles represent\nsomething that it queried\n\n1892\n01:38:58,855 --> 01:39:00,015\nduring that search.\n\n1893\n01:39:00,015 --> 01:39:03,715\nAnd you see we're getting just\nan insane amount of information, and\n\n1894\n01:39:03,715 --> 01:39:04,705\nit's literally still going.\n\n1895\n01:39:04,705 --> 01:39:06,785\nYou can see it's still\nbubbling stuff out in there.\n\n1896\n01:39:06,785 --> 01:39:08,030\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1897\n01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:12,370\n>> It's saying all those little name\n\n1898\n01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:17,500\nservers it found, it's going and querying\nthose name servers, finding records for\n\n1899\n01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:22,480\nthere and it's cross referencing with\nthis website and doing a bunch of things.\n\n1900\n01:39:22,480 --> 01:39:26,320\nThat's really kind of the neat\nthing about this tool.\n\n1901\n01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:30,860\nI'll just go ahead and close that.\n\n1902\n01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:35,410\nI can go over here, I can say,\nokay, let's start a new one.\n\n1903\n01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:38,470\nIf you look over here on the left\nhand side, I just ran the wizard.\n\n1904\n01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:40,530\nIf you look over here\non the left hand side,\n\n1905\n01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:45,750\nall these things out here\nare something that you can query.\n\n1906\n01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:49,805\nSo you can really just start\npicking stuff off that list.\n\n1907\n01:39:49,805 --> 01:39:53,310\nI ran transforms to look for them,\nbut I could grab one of these things,\n\n1908\n01:39:53,310 --> 01:39:57,040\ndrag it over, and set a property on\nit saying this is the object name,\n\n1909\n01:39:57,040 --> 01:40:00,030\nnow search everything\nrelated to that object name.\n\n1910\n01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:02,460\nSo, it can do a tremendous\namount of stuff.\n\n1911\n01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:08,670\nYou can see it's got stuff for images,\nand then look at the bottom of this.\n\n1912\n01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:14,640\nIt's got Facebook, Twitter,\nit's got a couple links with Facebook,\n\n1913\n01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:16,794\nand it's got hashtags,\nit will search on all those things.\n\n1914\n01:40:16,794 --> 01:40:19,510\n>> Wow.\n>> What's really neat about this is,\n\n1915\n01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:24,070\nif I somehow see a person or a company,\nand I wanna search Twitter and\n\n1916\n01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:29,190\nI wanna put some combination of things\ntogether that are related, I can just\n\n1917\n01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:34,311\ndrag those things over, so the property\nof it to the names of those objects.\n\n1918\n01:40:34,311 --> 01:40:35,747\nAnd then tell them,\n\n1919\n01:40:35,747 --> 01:40:40,870\nfind me everything that concerns\na relationship of these three items.\n\n1920\n01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:44,440\n>> So once you've picked your domain,\nnot only is it getting all the information\n\n1921\n01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:47,414\nabout the name servers and\nthe IP ranges and things like that, but\n\n1922\n01:40:47,414 --> 01:40:50,550\nit can also then go do our social media\naspect of it and hit Facebook and\n\n1923\n01:40:50,550 --> 01:40:52,258\nTwitter in relation to that domain.\n\n1924\n01:40:52,258 --> 01:40:53,372\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1925\n01:40:53,372 --> 01:40:55,056\n>> Wow, that's convenient.\n\n1926\n01:40:55,056 --> 01:40:57,908\n>> So I could choose,\nfor example, ITProTV and\n\n1927\n01:40:57,908 --> 01:41:01,886\nif there was another company\ninvolved with it then I could say,\n\n1928\n01:41:01,886 --> 01:41:06,932\ntake this domain and this domain and\nfind me everything that's relating to it.\n\n1929\n01:41:06,932 --> 01:41:08,773\nSo now all of a sudden\nit's gonna query and\n\n1930\n01:41:08,773 --> 01:41:12,210\nfind all the shared email addresses and\nall the stuff so I can see everything.\n\n1931\n01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:14,290\n>> Correspondence between\nthe two organizations, nice.\n\n1932\n01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:15,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n1933\n01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:18,530\nAnd it will even tell me locations too,\nso there's an ability to do that.\n\n1934\n01:41:18,530 --> 01:41:21,619\nSo if there's not any relationships\nit'll start pulling geolocations so\n\n1935\n01:41:21,619 --> 01:41:24,519\nif someone's sitting here working for\nboth, it's gonna find that.\n\n1936\n01:41:24,519 --> 01:41:26,156\n>> Wow, that is powerful stuff,\npowerful stuff.\n\n1937\n01:41:26,156 --> 01:41:27,182\nAll right so,\n\n1938\n01:41:27,182 --> 01:41:32,576\nI think you've blown all our minds with\nhow much information is out there.\n\n1939\n01:41:32,576 --> 01:41:34,765\n>> [SOUND] [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1940\n01:41:34,765 --> 01:41:39,230\nhow easy it is really to get\na lot of this information.\n\n1941\n01:41:39,230 --> 01:41:43,540\nBut then we saw when we pulled up\nyour name in that people search,\n\n1942\n01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:46,230\nwe got zero results found.\n\n1943\n01:41:46,230 --> 01:41:48,520\nSo super ninja, tell us how it's done.\n\n1944\n01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:49,412\nGive us some pointers.\n>> I'm Batman!\n\n1945\n01:41:49,412 --> 01:41:54,100\n[LAUGH]\n>> Tell us some of the things that we\n\n1946\n01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:58,360\nmight to do to help eliminate

you're leaving behind.\n\n1949\n01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:06,400\nWhen you go online you need to\nthink about what it is you do,\n\n1950\n01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:10,170\nwhat type of things you're exposing, and\nif it's something you want to expose.\n\n1951\n01:42:10,170 --> 01:42:15,250\nThat should be really the first\nthing that comes into your mind.\n\n1952\n01:42:15,250 --> 01:42:17,370\n>> Is it something that\nyou really wanna expose?\n\n1953\n01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:20,280\nIs it something that you are okay\nwith it being out there forever?\n\n1954\n01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,380\nCuz it's going to be out there forever.\n\n1955\n01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:24,849\nYou just gotta assume that's the case.\n\n1956\n01:42:24,849 --> 01:42:27,297\n>> So the first step is, don't leave\nthe information in the first place.\n\n1957\n01:42:27,297 --> 01:42:28,052\n>> Yeah.\n\n1958\n01:42:28,052 --> 01:42:32,010\nThey can't use what you haven't shared.\n\n1959\n01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:40,260\nOther things you have, consider using\nthings like proxies to obscure yourself.\n\n1960\n01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:45,330\nAlso consider, if you're a company,\nregistering things under a generic\n\n1961\n01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:49,330\naddress or name,\nbecause that can obscure some of this.\n\n1962\n01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:53,020\nYou can even use things like\nfreemailers if you have to put an email\n\n1963\n01:42:53,020 --> 01:42:54,390\naddress out there.\n\n1964\n01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:57,516\nInstead of putting your own email address\nthere, you can use one of these, or\n\n1965\n01:42:57,516 --> 01:43:00,740\nI should't say freemailers,\nthat's like Gmail and stuff like that.\n\n1966\n01:43:00,740 --> 01:43:02,640\nThere's things there\nwill forge your email.\n\n1967\n01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:05,780\nThere's services like, 33Mail is one.\n\n1968\n01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:09,460\nWhere you can set up an account there and\nit will set up an account, so\n\n1969\n01:43:09,460 --> 01:43:13,170\nbasically @yourname.33mail.com, and\n\n1970\n01:43:13,170 --> 01:43:17,300\nall you have to do is go to a website and\n\n1971\n01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:20,590\nfill out whatever normally would come\nbefore the at sign, whatever you want.\n\n1972\n01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:24,480\nSo if I go to, let's say,\nLinkedIn, I could say linkedin@ and\n\n1973\n01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:27,659\nfill in the rest of that\n@myname.33mail.com.\n\n1974\n01:43:27,659 --> 01:43:32,630\nAnd when Linkedin sends an email to that,\nmy service will generate that email\n\n1975\n01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:37,530\naddress on the fly and then forward\nit on to my email account for that.\n\n1976\n01:43:37,530 --> 01:43:41,600\nAnd the cool thing about that\nis that I use this all the time.\n\n1977\n01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:47,710\nIf a company is sending my email out or\nsays it's not going to share my email, and\n\n1978\n01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:52,200\nall of the sudden I see the account I used\nfor LinkedIn is now coming from whatever,\n\n1979\n01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,770\nFacebook or something,\nI know they shared it.\n\n1980\n01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:57,114\nBecause it was created custom for them\nright there on the fly, they've shared it.\n\n1981\n01:43:57,114 --> 01:44:01,196\nAnd you can have one account\nthat has LinkedIn@myname.com,\n\n1982\n01:44:01,196 --> 01:44:06,053\nFacebook@myname.com, whatever@myname.com,\nat 33mail.com.\n\n1983\n01:44:06,053 --> 01:44:06,830\nYou can have that and\n\n1984\n01:44:06,830 --> 01:44:09,861\nyou'll know exactly where it came from and\nyou can deactivate them on the fly.\n\n1985\n01:44:09,861 --> 01:44:11,648\nThat's all for free, so\n\n1986\n01:44:11,648 --> 01:44:16,257\nthat's something that you could\nalso use to kinda help you out.\n\n1987\n01:44:16,257 --> 01:44:20,833\nSo it's basically thinking that, keeping\nyour head down as much as possible.\n\n1988\n01:44:20,833 --> 01:44:21,963\n>> Right.\n\n1989\n01:44:21,963 --> 01:44:24,543\n>> So that would be the big one.\n\n1990\n01:44:24,543 --> 01:44:28,030\nThink about what it is you're leaving\nout there and I've showed you a lot.\n\n1991\n01:44:28,030 --> 01:44:29,900\nThink about all of that.\n\n1992\n01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:31,975\nThink about how it impacts you and\nyour company.\n\n1993\n01:44:31,975 --> 01:44:34,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1994\n01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:35,030\nQuestion out there.\n\n1995\n01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:37,510\nI don't know if we have any\nspecifics on specific products.\n\n1996\n01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:42,222\nDoes Maltego also\ncross-reference with Showdown?\n\n1997\n01:44:42,222 --> 01:44:45,498\n>> No, it doesn't cross-reference\nwith Showdown, but\n\n1998\n01:44:45,498 --> 01:44:47,876\nit can get a lot of the same information.\n\n1999\n01:44:47,876 --> 01:44:48,714\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n2000\n01:44:48,714 --> 01:44:49,214\nVery good, very good.\n\n2001\n01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:51,860\nAll right.\n\n2002\n01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,950\nSo really,\nwhen it comes down to it, first and\n\n2003\n01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:58,510\nforemost, if you're with\nthe organization and\n\n2004\n01:44:58,510 --> 01:45:02,410\nresponsible for this, think about what\nit is you're leaving in the first place.\n\n2005\n01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:04,240\nEducating users on what they can and\n\n2006\n01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:07,410\nshouldn't be posting on\nthese social media websites.\n\n2007\n01:45:07,410 --> 01:45:09,650\nExplain to them how easy it is to get.\n\n2008\n01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:12,290\nTalk to them about uploading pictures and\n\n2009\n01:45:12,290 --> 01:45:15,420\nall the information that might be\nin there that they're not aware of.\n\n2010\n01:45:15,420 --> 01:45:17,640\nSo, educating our users,\n\n2011\n01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:21,870\ntrying to limit the information that we're\nputting out there in the first place.\n\n2012\n01:45:21,870 --> 01:45:26,440\nUsing some of these anonymizers or using\nsome services that are available like when\n\n2013\n01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:30,580\nyou're registering your domain name,\nI know GoDaddy has a privacy option, for\n\n2014\n01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:33,170\nexample, that you pay a little\nextra with your registration,\n\n2015\n01:45:33,170 --> 01:45:34,860\nand then they do kind of\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n2016\n01:45:34,860 --> 01:45:39,360\nThey use themselves, when you pull\nback that registry information,\n\n2017\n01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:42,163\nor that WHOIS information,\nit looks like GoDaddy.\n\n2018\n01:45:42,163 --> 01:45:45,245\nSo anybody that's trying to contact\nthem would have to go through them and\n\n2019\n01:45:45,245 --> 01:45:47,585\nthen to us so we're not exposed directly.\n\n2020\n01:45:47,585 --> 01:45:50,385\nAnother way to, again,\nhide that information and\n\n2021\n01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:53,165\ntry to keep people from being\nable to find it too easily.\n\n2022\n01:45:53,165 --> 01:45:55,125\nWhat else do we talk about?\n\n2023\n01:45:56,615 --> 01:46:01,820\nA lot of different ways to try to keep\nthat information out of the public eye and\n\n2024\n01:46:01,820 --> 01:46:05,880\nunderstanding, too, that once it's out\nthere, it's very difficult to get back.\n\n2025\n01:46:05,880 --> 01:46:08,450\n>> Yeah.\nYou really can't put the genie back in\n\n2026\n01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:09,750\nthe bottle, you know.\n\n2027\n01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:11,810\nOnce you've put it out there, I mean, yes,\n\n2028\n01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:16,490\nthere's ways to take it off, to take it\nout of search engine and all that and\n\n2029\n01:46:16,490 --> 01:46:21,190\noffline, but those usually\ngovernment level options, you know.\n\n2030\n01:46:21,190 --> 01:46:26,200\nYou see people like that and\nI'd also tell you there's a point where if\n\n2031\n01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:32,220\nyou look at my name, my name's pretty\nunique, so it's kind of hard to hide,\n\n2032\n01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:35,450\nbut apparently I've done something\nto kind of keep my head down.\n\n2033\n01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:38,190\nBut if you search enough,\nyou'll find stuff on me.\n\n2034\n01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:42,410\nI can tell you, I have done stuff to\nlimit my amount of information, but\n\n2035\n01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:46,980\nI haven't tried to erase it all, even\nthough a lot of it is under my control,\n\n2036\n01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:51,510\nwell within my power to do that,\nlegally within my power to do that.\n\n2037\n01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:54,380\nThe thing is is that if I went ahead and\ntook it all offline and\n\n2038\n01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:57,930\nall of sudden you did a search on me and\nit's a big black hole, that's suspicious.\n\n2039\n01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:59,440\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\n\n2040\n01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,000\nAnd even if you can get it removed,\n\n2041\n01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,590\nwhat's to say that the Wayback Machine\nhasn't captured some of that.\n\n2042\n01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:09,100\nOr some other site hasn't cached it,\nor somebody's saved it, or\n\n2043\n01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:11,430\nwho knows where else it could be stored.\n\n2044\n01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:14,700\nSo you might get it from that legitimate\nsource that you uploaded to originally,\n\n2045\n01:47:14,700 --> 01:47:16,130\nor that had that information.\n\n2046\n01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:18,160\nYou still have to worry\nabout it being out there.\n\n2047\n01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:21,000\nSo it's, as we said, it's hard to\nput the genie back in the bottle.\n\n2048\n01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,150\nYou just gotta try to prevent\nit in the first place,\n\n2049\n01:47:23,150 --> 01:47:26,750\nor limit what's being put out there in the\nfuture, really, is what it comes down to.\n\n2050\n01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:31,130\nAll right, anything else we\nwanna add to footprinting?\n\n2051\n01:47:31,130 --> 01:47:35,770\n>> I would just really quick kinda\nwrap things up by talking about\n\n2052\n01:47:35,770 --> 01:47:39,010\nthe fact that when you're doing\nthese scans, and doing these checks,\n\n2053\n01:47:39,010 --> 01:47:42,990\nyou're leaving these footprints behind,\nthese digital tracks behind.\n\n2054\n01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:45,190\nSo you gotta start being proactive.\n\n2055\n01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:48,660\nWe haven't done too much during\nour footprinting exploration\n\n2056\n01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:51,550\nto really hide what we're doing,\nbecause we're just training.\n\n2057\n01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:54,750\nWe're showing stuff off here,\nwe're not busting into anything.\n\n2058\n01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:57,760\nBut if you're gonna be doing\nthis in a real world sense,\n\n2059\n01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:01,380\nyou would do stuff to hide your presence.\n\n2060\n01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:03,270\nThat's where you can\nuse search engines and\n\n2061\n01:48:03,270 --> 01:48:08,150\nstuff like, there's searches like\nDuckDuckGo, Start Page I told you about.\n\n2062\n01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:11,190\nThen there's other things you\ncan use to look around like Tor,\n\n2063\n01:48:11,190 --> 01:48:13,110\nwhich I'm kind of hesitant to mention.\n\n2064\n01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:15,180\nThen there's privacy browsers.\n\n2065\n01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:18,995\nLike I said,\nI used the EPIC privacy browser.\n\n2066\n01:48:18,995 --> 01:48:22,750\nBut, and I know there was some\nissue some people saw with that.\n\n2067\n01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:25,280\nThere's plenty of things\nout there you can use.\n\n2068\n01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:25,890\nBut think ahead.\n\n2069\n01:48:25,890 --> 01:48:28,340\nThink of stuff that could be hiding.\n\n2070\n01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,090\nJust to mention,\n\n2071\n01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:34,010\nthe reason why I say with Tor I'm\nkind of hesitant to mention that is\n\n2072\n01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:36,900\nbecause Tor's one of those things that's\ngiving people a false sense of security.\n\n2073\n01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:38,140\nIs it a secure system?\n\n2074\n01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:39,900\nYeah, it's a secure system.\n\n2075\n01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:42,450\nIt's only a secure system\nif you use it correctly.\n\n2076\n01:48:42,450 --> 01:48:45,435\nIf you have Tor and\nyou're using it inside of here,\n\n2077\n01:48:45,435 --> 01:48:50,400\nif you hook up your browser use Tor and\nyou have a bunch of plug-ins and\n\n2078\n01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:53,350\nstuff like that, those plug-ins\ncould be phoning home, in which\n\n2079\n01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:57,030\ncase they're gonna reveal who you are,\ncuz they're doing that outside of Tor.\n\n2080\n01:48:57,030 --> 01:49:00,910\nIf you use Tor to keep yourself\nanonymous and then you're logging into\n\n2081\n01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:04,460\nsocial media accounts and\nstuff like that, they know who you are.\n\n2082\n01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:07,660\nBecause you've given them something,\neven though it's hidden through the Tor\n\n2083\n01:49:07,660 --> 01:49:11,230\nnetwork, you've logged into\nsomething that ties it back to you.\n\n2084\n01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:17,510\nThere's just things like that that people\ndo that are just, quite frankly, dumb.\n\n2085\n01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:20,570\nYou know, it just makes them think,\nI'm using Tor, so I'm safe.\n\n2086\n01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:25,145\nWell, you're really not, because you're\ndoing stuff that's gonna give it away.\n\n2087\n01:49:25,145 --> 01:49:28,293\nTor can be something that can be\nvery powerful, but if you do things,\n\n2088\n01:49:28,293 --> 01:49:31,684\nthese little things that you might\nnot think anything of, they could be.\n\n2089\n01:49:31,684 --> 01:49:35,741\nWhat if you opened a PDF file through\nthat you download through Tor?\n\n2090\n01:49:35,741 --> 01:49:40,730\nPDFs do have links and stuff like that\nin them that can call home as well.\n\n2091\n01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:43,000\nSo that again can reveal your presence.\n\n2092\n01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:46,950\nSo you have to be smart about this\nstuff and just think about it.\n\n2093\n01:49:46,950 --> 01:49:47,490\n>> Very good.\n\n2094\n01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:48,750\nVery good.\nAll right.\n\n2095\n01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:52,130\nWell, ladies and gentleman, this episode\nwe have covered a lot of information.\n\n2096\n01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:56,930\nWe started out gathering IP address\nranges, and pulling back that information\n\n2097\n01:49:56,930 --> 01:50:00,890\nusing really cool tools like trace route,\nand visual trace, and path ping.\n\n2098\n01:50:00,890 --> 01:50:04,600\nThen we moved on into social media, and\nthat was a big eye opener, I think, for\n\n2099\n01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:09,020\na lot of people, realizing how easy\nit was to retrieve this information.\n\n2100\n01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:13,340\nReally cool stuff with the pulling up\nsome of the tweets on the maps with\n\n2101\n01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,870\nsome of those fantastic tools.\n\n2102\n01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:17,720\nWe've got some links in that chatroom for\nthose.\n\n2103\n01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:19,510\nTalked a little bit about\nsocial engineering, right?\n\n2104\n01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:20,952\nWe did a little high level overview,\n\n2105\n01:50:20,952 --> 01:50:24,690\nwe've got another episode we're gonna\ndeal more with social engineering, but\n\n2106\n01:50:24,690 --> 01:50:29,880\nas far as the footprinting phase goes,\nhow we can use that social engineering and\n\n2107\n01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:33,770\nthen a little bit about trying\nto maintain that low profile.\n\n2108\n01:50:33,770 --> 01:50:37,760\nHow can I prevent some of this information\nfrom getting out there in the first place?\n\n2109\n01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:41,270\nSo a lot to think about,\na lot of great information.\n\n2110\n01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:43,608\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n2111\n01:50:43,608 --> 01:50:46,160\nRemember, if you've got questions\nduring the show, at any time,\n\n2112\n01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:50,130\nyou can jump into that chat room and ask\nyour questions as I know many of you are.\n\n2113\n01:50:50,130 --> 01:50:52,960\nWe watch that and\nwe try to answer as many as we can.\n\n2114\n01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,720\nIf you're watching this recording,\nif you're watching this

00:00:37.290\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.460\nI am your host Mike Rodrick here\ntoday with Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.730\nHow are you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.880\n>> I am doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.420\n>> Alright well an exciting episode for\neverybody.\n\n8\n00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.622\nGlad to have Sean here with us.\n\n9\n00:00:48.622 --> 00:00:54.485\nWe are continuing on with our CEH episodes\nand today we're moving into module or\n\n10\n00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:59.305\nchapter five which is the next\nphase of our hacking process.\n\n11\n00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:03.570\nIn previous episodes we hit the first\nphase which was our foot printing phase.\n\n12\n00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.367\nIn this phase we're moving into\nphase number or this episode,\n\n13\n00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:10.177\nwe're moving into phase number two, which\nis that scanning phase, where we are going\n\n14\n00:01:10.177 --> 00:01:15.307\nto look at taking the information that we\ngained during our foot printing phase,\n\n15\n00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:22.583\nand starting to use that information to\nfurther our knowledge about our target and\n\n16\n00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:26.563\nreally and start reaching out and maybe\neven touching our target at this point.\n\n17\n00:01:26.563 --> 00:01:30.570\nSo, without further ado let's get started\nand see what we can do with our scanning.\n\n18\n00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.280\nSo where do we wanna start Sean?\n\n19\n00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.790\nWhat's a good place?\n\n20\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.200\nI guess just talking about\nscanning in general?\n\n21\n00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200\n>> Yeah.\n>> And why we use it, and\n\n22\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.030\nwhat we do with it?\n\n23\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.890\n>> Yeah.\nI think that's a good place to start,\n\n24\n00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.770\nis where does scanning fit in?\n\n25\n00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.940\nWell, let's kind of go back to something\nthat we had at the very beginning,\n\n26\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.550\nwhich is a scanning process.\n\n27\n00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.800\nOr sorry, the hacking process.\n\n28\n00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.754\nIt was foot printing then scanning and\nthen we said, inside the scanning,\n\n29\n00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:55.810\nis scanning and enumeration.\n\n30\n00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.350\nAnd then we have gaining access,\nmaintaining access and clearing tracks.\n\n31\n00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.290\nSo it just kind of\nprogressed right through.\n\n32\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.640\nSo we have seen over our past,\nyou know, few shows,\n\n33\n00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.440\nwe have seen what the foot\nprinting process entails and\n\n34\n00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.730\nyou should have good documentation\nat this point of what information\n\n35\n00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.050\nyou've collected and\nwhere you got it from.\n\n36\n00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.010\nYou should have all of that and\njust carrying into your.\n\n37\n00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.780\nNow what we can do, is we're gonna take\nthat information and we're gonna actively\n\n38\n00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.360\ninteract with our target and\nsee what that actually can translate into.\n\n39\n00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.200\nIs all that information true and correct?\n\n40\n00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.040\nWhich IP addresses are live and\nwhich ones are not?\n\n41\n00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.810\nYou know,\n\n42\n00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.600\nwe're going to be doing quite a bit of\nthat to probe around and feel things out.\n\n43\n00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.610\nBut we have definitely at this point\nwhy this is the foot printing phase,\n\n44\n00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.110\nthere's a passive and an active component.\n\n45\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.590\nWe did the passive first and\nthen we got progressively more active.\n\n46\n00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.630\nWe are getting very active at this point,\nwhen we want to engage our target.\n\n47\n00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.501\nSo I would encourage you\nto keep that in mind,\n\n48\n00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:02.740\nthat we are actively\nprobing that target now.\n\n49\n00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.648\nYou want to be much\ntighter with what you do,\n\n50\n00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:09.130\nmeaning be closer with what you target.\n\n51\n00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.740\nYou know, don't just carpet bomb stuff\nbecause that's a dead give away.\n\n52\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.090\nIn fact you shouldn't have\nto carpet bomb stuff.\n\n53\n00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.570\nYou have IP ranges.\n\n54\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.430\nYou've got technology.\n\n55\n00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.760\nYou've got quite a bit, so\nyou can really refine this.\n\n56\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.300\nRight.\n\n57\n00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.710\nSo, we're gonna talk about the stuff\nthat you are looking specifically to\n\n58\n00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.870\ngain in this phase.\n\n59\n00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.990\n>> And then this is probably a good place\nfor me to introduce our disclaimer.\n\n60\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.820\nBy continuing to watch this episode,\n\n61\n00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.040\nyou agree that you are not going to be\nusing these tools and techniques against\n\n62\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.610\nany network that you do not have specific\npermissions to do so against right?\n\n63\n00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.210\nSo continue watching, enjoy the show,\ndon't try this stuff at home unless you've\n\n64\n00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.870\ngot permissions, or a sandbox, or\nsome safe environment to do it in.\n\n65\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.400\nCause this point as John said at\nthis point we're reaching out,\n\n66\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.690\nwe're touching those guys.\n\n67\n00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.800\nAnd this is where,\ndepending on the country, the laws and\n\n68\n00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.800\nthe regulations that are in place,\nyou could start violating some things and\n\n69\n00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.550\nget yourself in trouble, right?\n\n70\n00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.560\n>> Remember, I have your names and\nI know where you live.\n\n71\n00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.125\n>> We have all your email addresses and\nI will sic Sean on you.\n\n72\n00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.870\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n73\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.120\nSo scanning really is all\nabout that next step, then.\n\n74\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.350\nWe're gonna take that information that we\ngained during that footprint phase and\n\n75\n00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.240\nstart to actually put it\nto use like you said.\n\n76\n00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.790\nWe've got a block of address ranges,\n\n77\n00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.020\nbut nobody said they're using every\nsingle one of those IP addresses.\n\n78\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.730\nThings like that.\n\n79\n00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.820\nSo that's where we're heading.\n\n80\n00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.750\nSo starting off, you know,\nwhen we say scanning,\n\n81\n00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.190\nthat's a pretty broad kind of category,\nright?\n\n82\n00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.470\nWe can break that down a little further?\n\n83\n00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.060\n>> Oh, yeah.\nWe definitely have to break that down\n\n84\n00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.670\nto different categories.\n\n85\n00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.860\nCuz we have port scans, we have\nnetwork scans, we have IP scans, and\n\n86\n00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.940\nthen even inside of those,\nwe have different shades or\n\n87\n00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.800\ntypes of scans we can do within that,\nthat will change the nature of the game.\n\n88\n00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.780\nSo we've got quite a bit of ground to\ncover as far as the different scans.\n\n89\n00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.400\nWe will start off finding things of what\nIP addresses are live, which ones are not.\n\n90\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.020\nThen we'll talk about doing port scans and\nwe'll actually see some port scans and\n\n91\n00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.380\nwhat those entail.\n\n92\n00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.622\nAnd then we'll talk later on,\nprobably not in this specific show, but\n\n93\n00:05:15.622 --> 00:05:19.170\nwe'll talk about and\nsee what network mapping looks like.\n\n94\n00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.246\nAnd then you're gonna be introduced to\nsome of the tools that use that, so\n\n95\n00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:27.717\nwe are gonna see some brand new tools,\nmaybe not brand new to everybody but we're\n\n96\n00:05:27.717 --> 00:05:32.422\ngonna see, we're going to see, you know,\nsome different tools and how they work.\n\n97\n00:05:32.422 --> 00:05:35.360\nWe're going to see Nmap and\nwe're going to see some other stuff.\n\n98\n00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.100\n>> Good, good.\n\n99\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.115\nAll right.\n\n100\n00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:40.140\nSo types of scans we're\ngoing to start with.\n\n101\n00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.070\nYou got any favorite tools\nyou want to break out or\n\n102\n00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.290\nyou just want to talk about\nthe different categories?\n\n103\n00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.345\n>> Let's talk about the different\ncategories, and then we'll move into the,\n\n104\n00:05:50.345 --> 00:05:52.540\nstart talking about the tools.\n\n105\n00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.470\nAnd along the way we'll also talks\nabout different types of scans, and\n\n106\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.338\nthen relate it back to those tools so\nyou can see what they look like.\n\n107\n00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:04.020\nAll right, so the scan that most people\n\n108\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.960\nassociate with when they talk\nabout scanning is a port scan.\n\n109\n00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.550\nBut before we get to that,\n\n110\n00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.040\nbefore you start checking to see what\nports are available on a system.\n\n111\n00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.990\nIf you don't know what ports are at this\npoint, just pause and go look it up.\n\n112\n00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.212\nNo, no, I'm kidding.\n[LAUGH] No, I'll tell you what they are.\n\n113\n00:06:24.212 --> 00:06:25.296\nJust relax.\n[LAUGH]\n\n114\n00:06:25.296 --> 00:06:26.401\n>> [LAUGH] Go back to the network\n\n115\n00:06:26.401 --> 00:06:28.980\nplus episode and\ndo a little bit of refresher there, right?\n\n116\n00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.050\n>> Well clearly,\nyou're not the intended audience.\n\n117\n00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.140\nNo, no, I'm kidding.\n\n118\n00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.800\nWell, I will explain that to you,\ndon't worry.\n\n119\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.260\nBut before you do that and\n\n120\n00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.730\nfind out what ports are open on a system,\nbefore you can even target a system.\n\n121\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.750\nBecause how are you gonna target a system?\n\n122\n00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.020\nYou find an IP address, right?\n\n123\n00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.120\n>> Yeah, I can't do a port scan if I\ndon't have an IP address to put on that\n\n124\n00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.160\nport scan.\n\n125\n00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.190\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n126\n00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.570\nAnd if we have that, if we do put\nan IP address in a port scanner,\n\n127\n00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.360\nwe do have IP addresses at this point,\nright?\n\n128\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.520\nWe collected that.\n\n129\n00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.740\nSo it sounds like we could just\ndump an IP address in there and\n\n130\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.480\ngo ahead and scan, okay?\n\n131\n00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.380\nAre all those IP addresses used?\n\n132\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.060\n>> Right.\n\n133\n00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.120\n>> That's the thing.\n\n134\n00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.020\n>> Yeah, typically when we're looking,\nyou guys are familiar.\n\n135\n00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.800\nI'm sure you've worked\non a couple of networks,\n\n136\n00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.870\nhave your home network and\nthings like that.\n\n137\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.740\nYou might have a block of addresses\navailable that are assigned to your\n\n138\n00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.300\norganization that you lease from ICANN or\nwhomever.\n\n139\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.848\nThat doesn't mean that you're\nusing all of them, right?\n\n140\n00:07:21.848 --> 00:07:25.050\nTypically we get more than we need so\nthat we can grow and so\n\n141\n00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.290\nthat we can expand and\nwe have a little room to do that,\n\n142\n00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.160\nwhich means when I get that block of\naddresses from my foot printing phase,\n\n143\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.040\nI don't know which ones you are using and\nwhich ones you are not.\n\n144\n00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.350\nSo one of the first things we want to\ndo is try to find those live hosts.\n\n145\n00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.220\nFigure out which IP, because I don't want\nto waste my time running port scans on IP\n\n146\n00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.970\naddresses that don't even have a node\nattached to that IP address, right?\n\n147\n00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.060\n>> Yeah, you just don't know.\n\n148\n00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.316\nIf you get a range of IPs,\na range of IPs it just says hey,\n\n149\n00:07:52.316 --> 00:07:55.223\nthis is all the ones they've leased.\n\n150\n00:07:55.223 --> 00:07:58.508\nIt doesn't mean that there's\nsomething live behind that.\n\n151\n00:07:58.508 --> 00:08:03.268\nSo, our job before we do a port scan\nIs to find the ones that are live.\n\n152\n00:08:03.268 --> 00:08:03.825\n>> Yeah.\n\n153\n00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:07.560\n>> So, we have to accomplish that,\nand there's many, many,\n\n154\n00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.570\nmany scanners that could be used to\naccomplish that task, so we're good there.\n\n155\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.170\nOnce we find the live ones, then the next\nstep is doing a port scan, okay.\n\n156\n00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:27.872\nNow, I joked around about what ports\nare and talked about them a bit.\n\n157\n00:08:27.872 --> 00:08:32.450\nSaid, hey just in case you're a noob,\n\n158\n00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:38.585\nas some people would say, not that I'm\na noob or anybody would call me that.\n\n159\n00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:39.739\n>> [LAUGH] Nobody would\never call you that.\n\n160\n00:08:39.739 --> 00:08:40.319\n>> Not like that.\n\n161\n00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:41.643\n>> Especially nobody here at ITProTV.\n\n162\n00:08:41.643 --> 00:08:44.060\n>> Yeah, nobody would call me that.\n\n163\n00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.600\n>> Being a guest host and everything,\nnobody would dare do that.\n\n164\n00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.044\n>> Because they know if they call me a\nnoob, they're going to have to co-sign for\n\n165\n00:08:49.044 --> 00:08:50.828\na stick of gum for the rest of their life.\n\n166\n00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:56.370\n>> I was going to say Jason is now\nnever going able to buy a car, a home.\n\n167\n00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.260\n>> Yeah, enjoy that criminal record.\n\n168\n00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.740\nMerry Christmas.\n\n169\n00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:04.040\nSo, but anyway, and so, what is a port?\n\n170\n00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:10.000\nWell, a port, when we talk about that, a\nport is something on a system or multiple\n\n171\n00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.820\nthings on a system that are where a\nservice actually sits behind and listens.\n\n172\n00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.060\nAnd we have three ranges of ports.\n\n173\n00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.350\nWe have our well known ports,\nour registered ports,\n\n174\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.320\nand then our dynamic assigned ones.\n\n175\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:27.790\nThe ones that we're really concerned with\nright off the bat are the well known ones,\n\n176\n00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.280\nthe port 80s, the 21s,\nthe stuff like that.\n\n177\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.920\nWe're looking for those ones.\n\n178\n00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.990\nAre the ones in the other\nranges of interest to us?\n\n179\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.700\nWell, yeah.\n\n180\n00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.601\nWe can gather that information.\n\n181\n00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:43.401\nSo what we need to do is we\nneed to go see what ports\n\n182\n00:09:43.401 --> 00:09:48.210\nare open on a system,\nthat's very important.\n\n183\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.250\nOnce we find those, that can tell us we\nhave a live IP address at this point.\n\n184\n00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.960\nWe scan it closer and\nfind out which ones are open and\n\n185\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.070\nthen in a later part of the scanning\nphase, which is the enumeration\n\n186\n00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.100\nportion of it, we can actually\nstart seeing what’s behind that.\n\n187\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.450\n>> Right.\n\n188\n00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.580\nYeah.\nAnd I like to teach people that are newer\n\n189\n00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:12.187\nto this stuff that we should know at\nthis point there is 65,535 ports,\n\n190\n00:10:12.187 --> 00:10:17.770\nright, 0 through 65,536, or\n535, somewhere around there.\n\n191\n00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.315\n>> Close enough.\n\n192\n00:10:18.315 --> 00:10:19.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> And you gotta know every\n\n193\n00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.120\nsingle one of them.\n\n194\n00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.270\nNo.\nEach one\n\n195\n00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:24.890\nof those ports could be considered\na connection point to that node, right?\n\n196\n00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.850\nBecause when computers communicate with\neach other, they create what's called\n\n197\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:32.310\na socket and a socket is made up of\na protocol, an IP address, and a port.\n\n198\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.622\nSo each one of those ports is\na connection point to that computer.\n\n199\n00:10:35.622 --> 00:10:38.980\nIt's how it keeps web traffic\nseparate from FTP traffic,\n\n200\n00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.170\nseparate from mail traffic,\nand things like that.\n\n201\n00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.005\nAnd so\nwe talk about doing these port scans,\n\n202\n00:10:45.005 --> 00:10:50.540\nwe're looking to see which ports out\nof those 65,536 or 535 are listening.\n\n203\n00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:53.270\nWhich ones are open, which ones\nare closed, which ones are available.\n\n204\n00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.190\nBecause then that tells us a lot\nof information about that system.\n\n205\n00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.150\nCould be, as you said,\n\n206\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:01.170\nlater on we'll talk about what we\ncan gain from that information.\n\n207\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.530\nBut at this point, we're just\ntrying to see which ones are open.\n\n208\n00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.050\nWhich possible avenues of attack,\n\n209\n00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.150\nwhich vectors, might I be able to\nuse against that particular node.\n\n210\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.820\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n211\n00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.900\nAnd I would tell you, by the way,\nif you still have issues with ports,\n\n212\n00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.780\nunderstanding the relationship,\nand some people do.\n\n213\n00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.220\nI mean,\nI can understand if you're new to it.\n\n214\n00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.890\nThink of a port and\nits relationship to an IP address.\n\n215\n00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:28.890\nI mean, you explained it really nicely\nin technical terms there, Mike.\n\n216\n00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.550\nBut there's actually another\nway I've looked at it,\n\n217\n00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.720\nif you're kind of still\na little bit fuzzy.\n\n218\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.720\nThink of ports and IP addresses,\n\n219\n00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.930\nthink of it like a you call\nan 800 number for your bank.\n\n220\n00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:43.640\nAnd then they're saying press one for\nthis, press two for this, press three for.\n\n221\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.500\nIt's kinda the same relationship,\nwhat we're talking here.\n\n222\n00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.100\nAnd then if you wanna get into the actual\nprotocol of it, that's like saying,\n\n223\n00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.890\npress one for English and press primero,\nnueve, whatever [LAUGH] for Spanish.\n\n224\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.510\nYeah so that's kind of what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n225\n00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:02.210\nSo if that helps you\nvisualize it a bit better,\n\n226\n00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:06.480\nthat works pretty well in this situation.\n\n227\n00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:13.160\nBut I guess I should also put something in\nhere as far as when we talk about ports.\n\n228\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.130\nI'm gonna mention a few of them in here.\n\n229\n00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:18.600\nIf you have my book,\n\n230\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:23.150\nyou'll notice in the book I've got\nmatrices of ports listed in there.\n\n231\n00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.935\nYou should, there's a probably about 20,\n\n232\n00:12:26.935 --> 00:12:30.212\n30 some odd ports that you are gonna\nneed to memorize for the exam.\n\n233\n00:12:30.212 --> 00:12:33.892\nIt's stuff like, it's the stuff that\nyou should already know anyway.\n\n234\n00:12:33.892 --> 00:12:34.740\n>> Most likely, yeah.\n\n235\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.524\n>> You're talking port 20,\nport 21, 25, 23,\n\n236\n00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:42.880\n80, 443, stuff like that.\n\n237\n00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.849\nIt's pretty much run of the mill stuff.\n\n238\n00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.000\nI will tell you in the real world,\njust from a practical sense,\n\n239\n00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.455\nis that some people like testing\nyou on the different ports.\n\n240\n00:12:52.455 --> 00:12:53.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like, what port is this for?\n\n241\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.985\nWhat port is that for?\n\n242\n00:12:54.985 --> 00:12:57.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Quite frankly, if you come to me and\n\n243\n00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:03.870\nsay, hey, if I ask you,\nhey what port is this?\n\n244\n00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.140\nIf you don't know.\n\n245\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:05.990\nOkay, fine, look it up.\n\n246\n00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.410\nYou know how to look it up, right?\n\n247\n00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.921\nYou know what Google is, right?\n\n248\n00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.620\n>> [LAUGH] We all have Google.\n\n249\n00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.090\n>> Right.\nAnd if I come to you and\n\n250\n00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.360\nsaid, hey do you know what port 171 is?\n\n251\n00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.910\nAnd you're like, it is.\n\n252\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.990\nUnless I know you and\nyou tell me what it is, unless I know you,\n\n253\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.560\nI'm not gonna take your word for it.\n\n254\n00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.610\nIt's not cuz I have any issue with you or\nanything else.\n\n255\n00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:24.490\nI don't expect people to\nmemorize these things.\n\n256\n00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:30.240\nI expect you to know what a protocol is,\na port is, and an IP address is.\n\n257\n00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.230\nI need that.\n\n258\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.120\nIf it's not one of the standard ones\nlike port 80 or 443, fine, look it up.\n\n259\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.150\nI'm cool with it.\n\n260\n00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:38.090\nThat's the thing.\n\n261\n00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:42.070\nIt's not practical to memorize,\nto try to memorize every possible one.\n\n262\n00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.840\nNot only couldn't you do that,\nit's just not practical.\n\n263\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.170\n>> Yeah, it's not necessarily\nreally when it comes down to it,\n\n264\n00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:49.900\ncuz we can always look\nup that information.\n\n265\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:52.960\nI always say if you work\nwith that stuff everyday,\n\n266\n00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.480\nyou might have all that stuff memorized.\n\n267\n00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.100\nIf you're the firewall guy or gal, or\nsomething like that, and you're constantly\n\n268\n00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.170\nmaking rules and opening and closing\nports, you might have it memorized.\n\n269\n00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.060\nOther network admins, they might be\nfamiliar with the ports that they use for\n\n270\n00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.160\nthe particular service that they manage,\nbut as you said,\n\n271\n00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.800\nit's an easily referenced thing, you could\nprint out something to keep on your desk.\n\n272\n00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.430\nFor the exam though, as Sean points out,\nlook at the book and there are some\n\n273\n00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.630\ndefinitely some well known ports, register\nports that we need to be familiar with.\n\n274\n00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.880\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n275\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.900\nThose are the ones I would expect you to,\nand AC counsel,\n\n276\n00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.930\nexpects you to be aware of.\n\n277\n00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:28.140\nThat's why I gave you that\ncheat sheet in the book.\n\n278\n00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.940\nAnd once you have those, hey,\nyou're in pretty good shape.\n\n279\n00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:33.530\nOnce you're done with the exam,\nthere's probably what,\n\n280\n00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.020\nabout ten, you say on it-\n>> Yeah.\n\n281\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.090\n>> That you should really\nkind of have filed away.\n\n282\n00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.370\nAnything beyond that, look it up.\n\n283\n00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.860\nJust look it up, do it the easy way.\n\n284\n00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.980\nLike I said, measure twice, cut once.\n\n285\n00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.360\nIf it's not something you use\nall the time, look it up.\n\n286\n00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.500\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n287\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:55.670\nSo we've got scanning IP addresses, IP\naddress ranges, trying to find live hosts,\n\n288\n00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.430\ndoing things like maybe ping sweeps,\nor something like that.\n\n289\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:01.380\nWe've talked about scanning.\n\n290\n00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:05.180\nOnce you find your live host then\nwe do port scans on those guys\n\n291\n00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.320\ntrying to determine what ports\nare open on that particular machine.\n\n292\n00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.330\nWhat else do we need to talk\nabout was what types of scans.\n\n293\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.470\n>> Well\n>> You have different protocols?\n\n294\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.010\n>> There's actually one more type of scan\nthat we should, to be fair, talk about,\n\n295\n00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.940\nand that is something that does take\nplace during this first portion\n\n296\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:29.090\nof the network scanning, or the scanning\nside of it is mapping out your network.\n\n297\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.320\nYou actually can do that in some\ncases where you can get a scan,\n\n298\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.470\nyou find enough of an opening\nwhere you can scan and\n\n299\n00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.360\nmap out devices and\nstuff like that on someone's network.\n\n300\n00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.600\nIt's not a common occurrence, but if\nyou're able to get some sort of internal\n\n301\n00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.390\naccess, or you're doing a test internally.\n\n302\n00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.974\nThen that is a totally valid thing to do,\n\n303\n00:15:47.974 --> 00:15:51.174\nto map out a device to\nlook at someone's network.\n\n304\n00:15:51.174 --> 00:15:54.450\nInteresting thing about that is,\nand I found in my experiences,\n\n305\n00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.675\nthat when you map out someone's network,\nit's not uncommon.\n\n306\n00:15:57.675 --> 00:16:02.323\nIt's also kinda scary that you\ncan map out someone's network and\n\n307\n00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:06.560\npresent somebody like the IT\ndirector a map of the network.\n\n308\n00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.800\nAnd hey, where'd you get that?\n\n309\n00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.270\nI haven't seen that one yet.\n\n310\n00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.690\nYeah, they don't recognize\ntheir own network.\n\n311\n00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.640\nIt's like wait a minute,\nyou don't have this?\n\n312\n00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.480\nAnd no, we haven't kept ours up to date.\n\n313\n00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.440\nAnd if you think about it, it's scary,\nbut it also makes sense in how\n\n314\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.000\nit can become that way because they\nmay have set that network up and\n\n315\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.950\nprobably it was set up at some point in\nthe way back past, and people came in and\n\n316\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.340\nmaintained it and started sticking\nstuff on and the people that\n\n317\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:37.740\noriginally set it up are long gone and\nhave moved on to wherever, retired.\n\n318\n00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.770\nSo now you have got a situation where that\nnetwork has grown and metamorphosized and\n\n319\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:42.980\nstuff like that.\n\n320\n00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.840\nSo, the diagrams they've had\nhave not kept up to date.\n\n321\n00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.209\nThey may have been kept up\nto date to a point, but\n\n322\n00:16:49.209 --> 00:16:54.090\nthen they are kinda just tapered off and\nare sitting there.\n\n323\n00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:56.340\n>> You see it in the best of intentions.\n\n324\n00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.810\nI mean, even here in our own network here,\nwe've got some spreadsheets that\n\n325\n00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.320\nwe're supposed to maintain when\nwe assign a static IP address.\n\n326\n00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.800\nWe go in there and say what we're\nusing it for and things like that.\n\n327\n00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.990\nSo other admins, if they need addresses\nthey can figure out what's available.\n\n328\n00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.890\nYou mean to keep it up to date, but\n\n329\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:13.140\nsometimes you're in a hurry,\nyou're trying to get something done.\n\n330\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.060\nAnd you go grab an IP address,\nyou assign it to some node and\n\n331\n00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.760\nyou forget to go take the time\nto go put it in the spreadsheet.\n\n332\n00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.705\nAll of a sudden somebody\nelse does the same thing,\n\n333\n00:17:20.705 --> 00:17:23.780\nwe end up with duplicate IPs and\nthings like that, so it's a mess.\n\n334\n00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.280\nBut there is some pretty cool tools\nthat I can use to map out that network.\n\n335\n00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.090\nBeing so dynamic, it's a good thing to\ndo if you're a part of the security for\n\n336\n00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.770\nan organization or if you're their\npen tester to use these tools and\n\n337\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.410\nmap out that network and as you pointed\nout, it's always funny when you surprise\n\n338\n00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:42.800\nsomebody with a couple extra servers\nthat they forgot were on the network.\n\n339\n00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.620\nOr, like hm.\n\n340\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.140\nAnd that just means those were nodes\nthat they didn't know about which means\n\n341\n00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:49.970\nthey're probably not being maintained.\n\n342\n00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.500\nIt's usually not a good thing.\n\n343\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.500\n>> Even if there's something\nthat is maintained.\n\n344\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:01.670\nIt's something that it's over here,\nand it's not listed over here.\n\n345\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:05.260\nSo the left hand and the right hand\ndon't know what each other is doing,\n\n346\n00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.310\nand that's not a good situation,\nto have that.\n\n347\n00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.630\nBecause there could be\ngaps in maintenance,\n\n348\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:15.940\nthere could be problems in various areas,\nand you don't want that.\n\n349\n00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.510\nYou wanna have stuff documented,\nas well as being maintained.\n\n350\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.310\nYou don't wanna have that disconnect.\n\n351\n00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.830\nAnd it's definitely been known to happen\nthat it's just not up to date, and\n\n352\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.480\nit's being maintained, or it's not up\nto date, and it's not being maintained.\n\n353\n00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.840\nWe gotta have stuff in\nconcert with one another.\n\n354\n00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.599\nIt's getting to be a little less common\nto find that when you map out networks\n\n355\n00:18:35.599 --> 00:18:39.182\nbecause of the utilities they have\nnowadays that can automate that, and\n\n356\n00:18:39.182 --> 00:18:43.494\nprobe, and find something to connect and\ndisconnect, but it's still not 100%.\n\n357\n00:18:43.494 --> 00:18:44.119\n>> Right.\n\n358\n00:18:46.452 --> 00:18:48.170\nAll right.\n\n359\n00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:54.430\nSo, when we do these scans, like I\nsay we're doing some of these tools.\n\n360\n00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.710\nDo we focus on a particular protocol or\n\n361\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:01.240\ndo we wanna make sure we're trying to\nuse different protocols when we do this?\n\n362\n00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.000\n>> You do want to use different protocols.\n\n363\n00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.290\nYeah, because each one can\ngive you different results.\n\n364\n00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.900\nAnd so you gotta get an idea of what\nthe different protocols are and\n\n365\n00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.790\nhow you might use them.\n\n366\n00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.960\nBut even before we get to that,\ncuz that's the port scan,\n\n367\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.130\nwhat I would like to do is actually\nsay before we do the port scan,\n\n368\n00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:29.510\ntake a look at a quick sweep of\nthe network to see which IPs are alive.\n\n369\n00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.820\nSo what I've done here just really quick\nto show you everything in sequence.\n\n370\n00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:40.230\nMike's talking about the port scan\nwhich is the next logical step,\n\n371\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.720\nbut we've gotta find targets for that.\n\n372\n00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.570\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n373\n00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.980\nwhat I got here is something\ncalled angry IP scanner.\n\n374\n00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.310\n>> Absolutely.\n>> The angry IP scanner is a classic one.\n\n375\n00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.420\nIt’s to help you find hosts on a network.\n\n376\n00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:58.740\nWhat this one has done is you could put in\na single IP or you could put an IP range.\n\n377\n00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.760\nThis one automatically\nputs an IP range in there.\n\n378\n00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.280\nAnd once I say that IP range is fine,\n\n379\n00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.290\nthen I'm just gonna accept\nthe one that's there.\n\n380\n00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.765\n>> Sean, I hereby give you\npermission to scan my network.\n\n381\n00:20:09.765 --> 00:20:10.736\n>> Well thank you.\n\n382\n00:20:10.736 --> 00:20:17.550\n>> [LAUGH] We gotta make sure we're\nremaining ethical, of course.\n\n383\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.130\n>> So it's okay.\n\n384\n00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:21.270\nThe ethics isn't until the last day,\nso we can be fine doing it.\n\n385\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.250\nNo, I'm kidding.\n\n386\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.010\nKidding.\n\n387\n00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:23.560\nAll right.\n\n388\n00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.870\nBut anyway, so\nI'm just gonna click Start on this and\n\n389\n00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:31.300\nwhat this does is this does a quick sweep.\n\n390\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.860\nI'm not too worried about doing a scan\nhere showing anything because this is all\n\n391\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.290\nbehind everything and\nisolated and all that.\n\n392\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:45.310\nBut what we're seeing here just really\nquickly that's popping up here,\n\n393\n00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:49.050\nif we go through the list of IPs here,\n\n394\n00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:54.590\nyou can see that Angry IP is telling me it\ntook 21 seconds to do it, so pretty quick,\n\n395\n00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:59.200\nbut found 30 live hosts on that.\n\n396\n00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.100\nAs we browse down this list,\n\n397\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:08.130\nanything that's in red is something\nthat there's no live thing behind it.\n\n398\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:14.400\nAnything that's blue represents something\nthat does have an object behind it.\n\n399\n00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.610\nSo those would be the ones that we\nwould start to actually target.\n\n400\n00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:24.151\nOnce we have those it's like okay,\nwe've got targets\n\n401\n00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:29.700\nwe've gone from 255 IP\naddresses down to say 30.\n\n402\n00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.689\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's gone down to that.\n\n403\n00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:34.900\nIt's gone down to that many.\n\n404\n00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.020\n>> I saw omicron on the list,\n\n405\n00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.118\nI forgot to get my computer off\nthe network before you started this stuff.\n\n406\n00:21:40.118 --> 00:21:44.730\n>> [LAUGH] But we've got these things.\n\n407\n00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.760\n>> This is a good example of, in our\nfootprinting phase we might have found\n\n408\n00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.690\nthat network block and maybe it was\na class C or a class B or some variable\n\n409\n00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:58.660\nlike [INAUDIBLE] so it could have had, if\nit was class C, what, 254 hosts possible.\n\n410\n00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:04.080\nWe just scanned all 254 IP addresses,\nreally only 30 systems worth interest.\n\n411\n00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.070\nOr at least that are up and\nrunning at this point.\n\n412\n00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.620\n>> Good.\n>> Had some systems shut down,\n\n413\n00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.420\nother IP addresses that\nare just not in use.\n\n414\n00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.850\n>> Yeah.\nExactly, so we've got a lot of good\n\n415\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:18.870\ninformation on here, or we narrowed down\nour targets and got some good information.\n\n416\n00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:23.580\nIt's not like a much more tightly target\nour attack and go into the port scan.\n\n417\n00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:28.360\n>> Right, cause there's 220 hosts that we\ndon't have to bother port scanning now.\n\n418\n00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.925\n>> Yeah, and keep in mind if you\nmove directly into a port scan,\n\n419\n00:22:30.925 --> 00:22:34.695\nlet's say I went through this list and\ngrabbed dot 11 off this list.\n\n420\n00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:36.785\nIt's in red, there's nothing back there.\n\n421\n00:22:36.785 --> 00:22:39.055\nIf you do a port scan with it,\nor against that,\n\n422\n00:22:39.055 --> 00:22:41.915\na port scan is going to sit there and\nkind of just beat itself.\n\n423\n00:22:41.915 --> 00:22:43.625\n>> It'll do the scan, right?\n\n424\n00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:45.035\n>> Yeah, it'll attempt to do it.\n\n425\n00:22:45.035 --> 00:22:47.475\n>> Show everything closed or\nnot responding.\n\n426\n00:22:47.475 --> 00:22:51.165\n>> Yeah, and actually depending on the\ntype of scan, which we haven't got into\n\n427\n00:22:51.165 --> 00:22:55.170\nthe different types of scans, depending on\nthe type of scan, it could sit there for\n\n428\n00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:59.680\na long time, waiting for\nresponses that are never gonna come.\n\n429\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.730\nAnd so you could be just wasting\ntime doing that, a considerable\n\n430\n00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:10.600\namount of time if you're gonna be\nscanning numerous ones, which you can do.\n\n431\n00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.340\nYou can definitely do that.\n\n432\n00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.820\nAngry IP is one that can do it,\nit's a very fast one, as you can see it.\n\n433\n00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:19.940\nOr as you saw.\n\n434\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.100\nSomeone in the discussion mentioned Nmap.\n\n435\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.070\nNmap you can use to do this as well.\n\n436\n00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.340\nNmap I'm reserving to do our port scans,\n\n437\n00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.335\nbut yes, Nmap is, I think you mentioned,\nit's a Swiss Army knife.\n\n438\n00:23:33.335 --> 00:23:34.210\n>> [LAUGH] It is.\n\n439\n00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.630\n>> Yeah, you can do a lot with it, and\n\n440\n00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.940\nit's gonna be to your benefit to\nlearn how to use Nmap really well.\n\n441\n00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:44.790\nUp and beyond what we're\ngonna even do in class, but\n\n442\n00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:49.565\nthat's what's coming in, so you're\nabsolutely right if you mention that.\n\n443\n00:23:49.565 --> 00:23:52.770\nNmap can do a bunch of different things,\nbut there's other scanners too.\n\n444\n00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:56.121\nThere's scanners that do different types\nof ping sweeps and stuff like that.\n\n445\n00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:58.663\nNmap can do way more than Angry IP can.\n\n446\n00:23:58.663 --> 00:24:04.119\nAngry IP is a very, very Very,\nvery specific tool.\n\n447\n00:24:04.119 --> 00:24:08.794\nIt does this one thing, and\nit does it very, very, very well.\n\n448\n00:24:08.794 --> 00:24:12.562\nIf you're looking to do port scans and\nstuff like that, this won't help you.\n\n449\n00:24:12.562 --> 00:24:16.130\nIt's just gonna say,\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n450\n00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.825\nDo you want me to tell you there's\nsomebody living behind there or not?\n\n451\n00:24:18.825 --> 00:24:19.418\n>> Right?\n\n452\n00:24:19.418 --> 00:24:22.848\n[LAUGH] Yeah, lots of tools out there.\n\n453\n00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:26.630\nAnd as Sean says, you're gonna\npick the one that you like best.\n\n454\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.116\nAnd you might have several that you\nuse depending on the situation.\n\n455\n00:24:30.116 --> 00:24:33.152\nIf I wanna use a nice GUI front end,\nI wanna do it quick,\n\n456\n00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:36.782\nI'm not worried about making a lot\nof noise, I grab Angry IP, and\n\n457\n00:24:36.782 --> 00:24:40.990\nas you saw, it hit all 254\naddresses in a matter of seconds.\n\n458\n00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:43.833\nWhich is great if I need fast results,\nmaybe not so\n\n459\n00:24:43.833 --> 00:24:45.874\ngood if I'm trying to hide myself.\n\n460\n00:24:45.874 --> 00:24:49.883\nCuz all of the sudden we could making\na little extra, that kind of noise on\n\n461\n00:24:49.883 --> 00:24:54.150\nthe network can be detected and\ncould throw off some kind of alert.\n\n462\n00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.408\nSo, what was the one Foundstone put out,\nSuperScan?\n\n463\n00:24:57.408 --> 00:24:58.770\n>> SuperScan.\n>> SuperScan, I think it was.\n\n464\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.475\nScooper, SuperScan was a, scooper scan?\n\n465\n00:25:01.475 --> 00:25:03.727\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> SuperScan was a pretty fun one to play\n\n466\n00:25:03.727 --> 00:25:04.280\nwith, too.\n\n467\n00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.343\nAnd it was another one that did many\nthings other than just doing the ping\n\n468\n00:25:08.343 --> 00:25:08.891\nsweeps.\n\n469\n00:25:08.891 --> 00:25:12.370\nIt would do some who is look-ups and\nsome port scans as well.\n\n470\n00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:15.445\nSo, lots of possibilities there.\n\n471\n00:25:15.445 --> 00:25:19.475\n>> SuperScan's one that we will be seeing\nlater on when we go into our numeration\n\n472\n00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:20.658\nportion of scanning.\n\n473\n00:25:20.658 --> 00:25:22.523\n>> Oh nice, nice.\n\n474\n00:25:22.523 --> 00:25:25.244\n>> And\nit's actually a great one to mention,\n\n475\n00:25:25.244 --> 00:25:28.580\nbecause SuperScan does do\na lot of different scans.\n\n476\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.720\nBut why doesn't it get as\nmuch press as Nmap does?\n\n477\n00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.296\nIt's because SuperScan,\nas far as port scanning goes,\n\n478\n00:25:38.296 --> 00:25:42.700\nit does do port scanning well, but\nit's a lot more noisy than Nmap is.\n\n479\n00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.830\nNmap, you can tailor it a bit more.\n\n480\n00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.790\nBut SuperScan, if you just do the port\nscanning portion of it, it's really noisy.\n\n481\n00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:53.740\nWhich is one of the reasons why,\nwhen you are evaluating port scanners,\n\n482\n00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.750\nfinding one that does a good job, and\n\n483\n00:25:56.750 --> 00:26:02.220\nis also very quiet, and\nis configurable, is a big thing.\n\n484\n00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.520\nDoesn't mean we don't have a place for\nSuperScan.\n\n485\n00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.130\nIt's actually a pretty neat utility,\nbut it has some areas, some very,\n\n486\n00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:10.360\nvery good areas.\n\n487\n00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.780\nYou kinda want to say,\ndo I really want to use that, or\n\n488\n00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.134\ndo I wanna go someplace else\nto use that capability?\n\n489\n00:26:17.134 --> 00:26:18.330\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n490\n00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.800\nLooking at the clock,\nit is about time for our break.\n\n491\n00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.790\nSo we're gonna stop here.\n\n492\n00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:26.200\nWhen we come back,\nmore on scanning your network.\n\n493\n00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.270\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n494\n00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:27.922\nBack in a few.\n\n495\n00:26:27.922 --> 00:26:34.930\n[SOUND]\nAll right,\n\n496\n00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.150\nwelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n497\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:39.040\nContinue on with our scanning topic.\n\n498\n00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.410\nI think the next thing\nwe're gonna go into,\n\n499\n00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:43.580\nwe're gonna take a look at\nsome of the types of scans.\n\n500\n00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.210\nAnd before we get into that,\nwe really need to understand\n\n501\n00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:50.020\nthe way some of these things are working\nso we can accurately interpret\n\n502\n00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.020\nthe results that we're going to get\nfrom these port scans, right Sean?\n\n503\n00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.400\n>> Yeah, that's really it.\n\n504\n00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.880\nBefore we see just what types of scans\nwe're gonna be using, we need to\n\n505\n00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.370\nsee what is happening underneath\nthe hood that makes this possible.\n\n506\n00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:08.600\nSo if we kind of reference back to some\nof the stuff we've been talking about,\n\n507\n00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.750\nwe talked about what port and\nall that are, but\n\n508\n00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.410\nwe kind of figure out how do we\ntell if a port is open or closed.\n\n509\n00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:21.432\nThat's an important thing here, is that a\nport's going to be in one of those states.\n\n510\n00:27:21.432 --> 00:27:25.760\nBut to be able to determine that, there\nhas to be a technique that's put there.\n\n511\n00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:31.000\nSo, the technique we're gonna be using\ninvolves using one of two protocols,\n\n512\n00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.880\nfirst of all.\n\n513\n00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.040\nThere's TCP and UDP.\n\n514\n00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:38.550\nTCP is a connection oriented\nprotocol which means that every\n\n515\n00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.437\nconnection is gonna be acknowledged,\n\n516\n00:27:41.437 --> 00:27:46.428\nat least as all we're concerned is\nthe acknowledgement part of it.\n\n517\n00:27:46.428 --> 00:27:47.840\nYes, I do know there's other parts of TCP.\n\n518\n00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:52.044\n>> Right, guaranteed delivery and all\nthat good stuff, and error correction and\n\n519\n00:27:52.044 --> 00:27:55.942\ndetection, but in this point we're\nworried about the connection part.\n\n520\n00:27:55.942 --> 00:27:57.387\n>> Yeah, and that stuff,\n\n521\n00:27:57.387 --> 00:28:01.830\nother things we'll worry about\nwhen the time comes later on.\n\n522\n00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:06.520\nFor right now, we will just say\nthat it makes acknowledgements, and\n\n523\n00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.390\nthat's the important thing.\n\n524\n00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:15.410\nThen we have UDP, which is\na connection-less or best-effort protocol.\n\n525\n00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.080\nIt's basically fire and forget.\n\n526\n00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.490\nIt sends something out,\nand that's it [LAUGH].\n\n527\n00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.048\nIt's like dropping a letter in a mailbox,\nversus a TCP,\n\n528\n00:28:23.048 --> 00:28:26.321\nwhich is putting a return receipt on\nthat and dropping it in the mailbox.\n\n529\n00:28:26.321 --> 00:28:27.490\n>> Certified mail or something like that.\n\n530\n00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.330\n>> Yeah, certified mail, exactly.\n\n531\n00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.760\nSo that's the difference between the two,\nto kinda compare and contrast.\n\n532\n00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.510\nSo TCP has its own way of scanning,\nUDP has it's own way of scanning.\n\n533\n00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:43.790\nOkay, so we'll focus on the TCP first\nbecause it's a bigger topic and\n\n534\n00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:47.480\nthere's a lot of stuff happening there\nthat we kind of wanna make sure that\n\n535\n00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.860\nwe've got down and understand so\nwe can use it in the best way possible.\n\n536\n00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.330\n>> All right, so when we were\ntalking about TCP I guess we really,\n\n537\n00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.961\nwe were talking about that\ngood old three way handshake.\n\n538\n00:29:00.961 --> 00:29:03.360\n>> Oh yes, the three way handshake.\n\n539\n00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.430\n>> And that's, because it is as Sean said,\nit's acknowledgement based.\n\n540\n00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:08.720\nThey're going to acknowledge\nthat connection.\n\n541\n00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.640\nThere's a process that our two\nhosts goo through when they're\n\n542\n00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.180\nestablishing that connection before\nthey start sending data back and forth.\n\n543\n00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:19.676\nAnd we can take advantage of that process\nwith these scanning tools to determine\n\n544\n00:29:19.676 --> 00:29:20.935\nwhether that port's open.\n\n545\n00:29:20.935 --> 00:29:24.503\nBecause it's like, I don't know, it would\nbe kinda like saying, if I stick my hand\n\n546\n00:29:24.503 --> 00:29:28.095\nout to shake your hand, and there's no\nother hand, and that port's closed maybe.\n\n547\n00:29:28.095 --> 00:29:32.205\nIf I get a hand to shake,\nthen that port is open, right?\n\n548\n00:29:32.205 --> 00:29:34.188\n>> Yes, you're right, yeah.\n\n549\n00:29:34.188 --> 00:29:37.814\nIt does get to that,\nthat when you shake hands,\n\n550\n00:29:37.814 --> 00:29:41.812\nthe type of handshake you\nget back can tell you a lot.\n\n551\n00:29:41.812 --> 00:29:44.140\nThey say handshakes tell\nyou a lot about a person.\n\n552\n00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:47.120\n[LAUGH] It's true with computers too.\n\n553\n00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:51.632\nSo the results you get can tell you a lot.\n\n554\n00:29:51.632 --> 00:29:56.456\nSo, let's talk about things that\nare supposed to work, and then we're gonna\n\n555\n00:29:56.456 --> 00:30:00.940\ntalk about how we can manipulate that\nto get the results that we want.\n\n556\n00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.270\nSo the three way handshake\nis that key thing.\n\n557\n00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:09.360\nThat three way handshake is, like it says,\nthere's three steps happening.\n\n558\n00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.320\nIf we take a computer A and\na computer B, or\n\n559\n00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.730\nhost A and host B, if you want to\ncall it that, if it makes it easier,\n\n560\n00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:19.910\nwhat we do is we have the two systems and\nthey're gonna be using the TCP protocol.\n\n561\n00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.919\nWhat happens is the initial connection and\n\n562\n00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:27.120\nthen we'll say As trying\nto make a connection to B.\n\n563\n00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.900\nSo A will send an initial\nconnection request.\n\n564\n00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.981\nB will send an acknowledgement to\nyour connection request saying,\n\n565\n00:30:32.981 --> 00:30:33.852\nyes I can connect.\n\n566\n00:30:33.852 --> 00:30:37.285\nAnd then A sends a final\nresponse back to that saying,\n\n567\n00:30:37.285 --> 00:30:42.245\nyes I'm acknowledging that, and\nI'm saying I'm gonna accept your offer or\n\n568\n00:30:42.245 --> 00:30:44.855\nwhatever to accept it to connect to you.\n\n569\n00:30:44.855 --> 00:30:48.914\nAnd so once that's completed you have\na fully open connection you can exchange\n\n570\n00:30:48.914 --> 00:30:51.080\ninformation at that point.\n\n571\n00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.928\nNow, [COUGH] every TCP\nconnection should be doing that,\n\n572\n00:30:55.928 --> 00:30:59.032\nand does do that by its very nature.\n\n573\n00:30:59.032 --> 00:31:00.960\nAgain, UDP does not do that.\n\n574\n00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.808\nIt's not designed to do that, and\ntherefore it won't happen over there.\n\n575\n00:31:05.808 --> 00:31:09.700\nSo the key to our scanning\ntechniques is getting in and\n\n576\n00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.507\nmanipulating that specific\nthree way handshake and\n\n577\n00:31:13.507 --> 00:31:17.846\nthe responses that may or\nmay not come back from the system.\n\n578\n00:31:17.846 --> 00:31:20.966\nNow to kind of zoom in just a little\ncloser once we know the three\n\n579\n00:31:20.966 --> 00:31:23.679\nway handshake does that,\nwe zoom in a little closer.\n\n580\n00:31:23.679 --> 00:31:27.400\nWhat's actually happening when those\nconnections go back and forth?\n\n581\n00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.520\nWell there's basically\npackets going back and\n\n582\n00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:33.000\nforth, firing the stuff to\ntell us what's going on.\n\n583\n00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.540\nFor example, when A sends its initial\nconnection request over to B,\n\n584\n00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.140\nit sends a packet across that has\nsomething called the SYN flag being sent.\n\n585\n00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.745\nA synchronized flag saying it\nwants to make a connection.\n\n586\n00:31:44.745 --> 00:31:47.952\n>> To request that synchronization\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n587\n00:31:47.952 --> 00:31:51.670\nAnd then B responds to it,\nsomething called a SYN ACK.\n\n588\n00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.273\nIt's acknowledging a SYN request.\n\n589\n00:31:54.273 --> 00:31:57.304\nSo it's saying yes,\nI acknowledge your connection request.\n\n590\n00:31:57.304 --> 00:31:59.915\nAnd then when A gets that back from B,\n\n591\n00:31:59.915 --> 00:32:04.465\nB responds with a There with its\nsecond packet or third packet and\n\n592\n00:32:04.465 --> 00:32:09.390\nthe sequence over all, and says,\nI'm acknowledging your synex.\n\n593\n00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.900\nSo it turns on an act flag.\n\n594\n00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.700\nAnd all these thing\nare what we call flags.\n\n595\n00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.061\nIt sends up an act flag\non that packet back to b,\n\n596\n00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:20.832\nand that fully opens the connection.\n\n597\n00:32:20.832 --> 00:32:25.176\n>> Right, and\nwith TCP being connection oriented and\n\n598\n00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:31.714\nthe ability to where if I don't get\na packet, I can request to get it again.\n\n599\n00:32:31.714 --> 00:32:35.340\n>> And packets can take different routes\nas they go through the network, and\n\n600\n00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:36.980\nthey might arrive out of order.\n\n601\n00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:39.850\nAnd I need to be able to put those\nback together in the proper order.\n\n602\n00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:43.920\nThat send request that we send out,\nwe send that packet with that flag,\n\n603\n00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.450\none of the flags in there\nthat has that packet.\n\n604\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.620\nThe sim packet is turned on,\nor set to a one.\n\n605\n00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:50.900\nIt put a little synchronization\nnumber in there.\n\n606\n00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:55.790\nAnd as Shawn said, host b,\nthe receiver of that initial send request,\n\n607\n00:32:55.790 --> 00:33:00.190\nacknowledges that synchronization request\nas okay, I've got your send request.\n\n608\n00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.420\nI see the number that\nyou're gonna start with.\n\n609\n00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.570\nHere's your acknowledgement and\nhere's my own synchronization request.\n\n610\n00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.010\nThis is the number I'm gonna start with.\n\n611\n00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:08.680\nAnd then,\n\n612\n00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.240\nthe host a then responds with that final\nacknowledgment saying hey, I got yours.\n\n613\n00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.560\nSo now, they each know what number they're\ngonna start with when they start sending\n\n614\n00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.670\npackets back and forth.\n\n615\n00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.970\nAnd the packets then, they can tell what\norder those packets are gonna go in cuz\n\n616\n00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.500\nevery packet then is gonna\nincrement that number.\n\n617\n00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.650\nSo now, they're both in agreement\nof what each other is going to use.\n\n618\n00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:30.140\nAnd these are,\nI guess some of the pros are going to\n\n619\n00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.890\nstart randomizing those up a little bit\nas far as what number they start with.\n\n620\n00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:34.590\nWhich is what made.\n\n621\n00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.690\nAnd we’ll talk all later about things\nlike about man in the middle and\n\n622\n00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:37.340\nthings like that.\n\n623\n00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.149\nIt makes it a little bit more difficult.\n\n624\n00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:40.138\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n625\n00:33:40.138 --> 00:33:43.590\n>> But in our case, what we're really\nworried about at this point is just that\n\n626\n00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:47.540\nhandshake and whether or\nnot it's established, or\n\n627\n00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.890\nif it's not established, how the other\nend responds or a lack of response.\n\n628\n00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.800\nCuz that can give us a lot of\ninformation about the system.\n\n629\n00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.690\nAnd there are some types of\nattacks we can do with this, but\n\n630\n00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.120\nI think that'll come on in a later module.\n\n631\n00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.770\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n632\n00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:07.689\nAnd as Mike was saying, yes, there\nare sequence numbers stamped on those.\n\n633\n00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:12.910\nNow, for the scanning we're talking about\nnow we're not gonna really even worry\n\n634\n00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:18.760\nabout those yet, but don't let that\nkind of lure you into a complacency.\n\n635\n00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.680\nIt's good to know about this because yes,\n\n636\n00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:25.570\nit does come into play when we talk about\nsession hijacking and man in the middle.\n\n637\n00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.380\nAll that type of stuff.\n\n638\n00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.230\nIt does come into play.\n\n639\n00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.148\nWe wanna make sure that\nyou are aware of that.\n\n640\n00:34:32.148 --> 00:34:35.813\nKnowing these little details about TCP,\nwhile you may not use them in one spot,\n\n641\n00:34:35.813 --> 00:34:37.190\nyou will use them in another.\n\n642\n00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:40.615\nSo don't forget that while\nwe're only looking at one port,\n\n643\n00:34:40.615 --> 00:34:44.386\none specific component of this,\nthe sequence numbers are there.\n\n644\n00:34:44.386 --> 00:34:45.183\nAnd there's other things.\n\n645\n00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:51.630\nSome of you out there are really good\nwith this and brainiacs with this stuff.\n\n646\n00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:57.280\nSo you could probably list a whole bunch\nof stuff with TCP, and go on and on.\n\n647\n00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.440\nWhat about this, this, and this?\n\n648\n00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.393\nWell, we don't necessarily need to know\nall of that, but things like flags and\n\n649\n00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:06.406\nsequence numbers, and\nstuff like that are very important.\n\n650\n00:35:06.406 --> 00:35:08.176\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n651\n00:35:08.176 --> 00:35:12.376\nAll right, so when we look at\nthat three way handshake and\n\n652\n00:35:12.376 --> 00:35:14.311\nI guess we won't tell it.\n\n653\n00:35:14.311 --> 00:35:15.263\nIf the port is open,\n\n654\n00:35:15.263 --> 00:35:18.920\ntypically we're going to successfully\ncreate that three-way handshake.\n\n655\n00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.370\nCuz that's what gives\nus that TCP connection.\n\n656\n00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:26.463\nWhat if the port is not open?\n\n657\n00:35:26.463 --> 00:35:28.176\n>> If the port is not open,\n\n658\n00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:33.660\nit depends on what you set to that\nport of how it's gonna respond.\n\n659\n00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.090\nThat's the key thing.\n\n660\n00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:35.940\nAnd if it's open or\n\n661\n00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.600\nclosed, that's gonna change the type\nof response you get as well.\n\n662\n00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.420\n>> And then,\neven platforms can respond differently?\n\n663\n00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.630\n>> Even platforms, yes,\nthey absolutely can respond differently\n\n664\n00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:49.740\nbased on version and\ntype and service pack.\n\n665\n00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.630\nThere's a lot of things that can get into\nit and kind of muddy the waters a bit, but\n\n666\n00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:56.270\nthere are some consistencies in there.\n\n667\n00:35:56.270 --> 00:36:00.150\nSo don't let that kind of get you to\nsidetrack and say, how do I know?\n\n668\n00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.710\nThere's all these different things.\n\n669\n00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.780\nWell, there are ways to even use\nthose differences and responses.\n\n670\n00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.900\nThat's a good thing for you.\n\n671\n00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.990\nDon't think it's a bad thing.\n\n672\n00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:09.520\nIt's a good thing,\nwith these difference and\n\n673\n00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.520\nresponses correspond to\nunique fingerprints.\n\n674\n00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:15.390\nAnd those fingerprints are known.\n\n675\n00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.620\nYou're not the first budget person\nto run into this in many cases.\n\n676\n00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:19.700\nNot the first person to run into it.\n\n677\n00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.840\nSomeone's run into it.\n\n678\n00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.360\nSeveral people have run into it.\n\n679\n00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:25.840\nAnd they've documented it, built it into\nsomething someplace, into a database.\n\n680\n00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:29.110\nAnd now, we can finger print a system,\nso we can fire something at a system,\n\n681\n00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.060\nget a response back and\nknow immediately what it is.\n\n682\n00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.420\nWhich is to your advantage so\nwe don't want to panic about that.\n\n683\n00:36:36.745 --> 00:36:39.425\nBut even before we get to that though\n\n684\n00:36:39.425 --> 00:36:42.630\nwith something else we gotta talk\nabout is we gotta talk about flags.\n\n685\n00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.675\n>> Mm, yeah.\n>> We just let that peek out\n\n686\n00:36:44.675 --> 00:36:45.315\na bit-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n687\n00:36:45.315 --> 00:36:47.025\n>> On a three way handshake.\n\n688\n00:36:47.025 --> 00:36:47.871\n>> I get excited, I get excited.\n\n689\n00:36:47.871 --> 00:36:48.854\n>> Yeah, get excited.\n\n690\n00:36:48.854 --> 00:36:52.700\nI'm excited too.\n\n691\n00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:53.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, [CROSSTALK]\n\n692\n00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:54.279\n>> Scanning some stuff,\n\n693\n00:36:54.279 --> 00:36:55.174\ncome on!\n>> Are you excited or\n\n694\n00:36:55.174 --> 00:36:56.694\nhave you had like five or\nsix Mountain Dews today, what is it?\n\n695\n00:36:56.694 --> 00:37:00.276\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n696\n00:37:00.276 --> 00:37:04.847\n>> So, let's get into flags on\n\n697\n00:37:04.847 --> 00:37:10.200\nthe TCP protocol.\nThat's the key to this whole thing.\n\n698\n00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.930\nWe can talk about all these other things,\nbut\n\n699\n00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.580\nwhat really makes the scans work\nis knowing the different flags.\n\n700\n00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:20.291\nAnd for us, for\nwhat we need to know for CEH and\n\n701\n00:37:20.291 --> 00:37:24.730\ndoing our scanning is we\nneed to know six flags.\n\n702\n00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:28.295\nNow, Six Flags, great rollercoasters,\nbut not that one.\n\n703\n00:37:28.295 --> 00:37:30.736\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's not what we're talking about.\n\n704\n00:37:30.736 --> 00:37:32.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I worked it right in.\n\n705\n00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:37.070\nSo, but\nwe have six flags we gotta worry about.\n\n706\n00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:45.000\nTCP has more flags than that, there's\nthings like CWR and other stuff like that.\n\n707\n00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.910\nThose don't really come in with,\nend up into our port scanning.\n\n708\n00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:53.340\nSo yes, I do know there's more\nthan six flags there, but\n\n709\n00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.045\nthere's only six that we need\nto worry about for here.\n\n710\n00:37:56.045 --> 00:37:56.700\nOkay?\n\n711\n00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.630\nSo just kinda wanna put that out there.\n\n712\n00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:03.087\nSo the flags,\njust to make sure you know them, and\n\n713\n00:38:03.087 --> 00:38:05.793\nwe'll talk about what each one of them is.\n\n714\n00:38:05.793 --> 00:38:07.059\nThere's an ACK flag.\n\n715\n00:38:07.059 --> 00:38:12.780\nThere's an URG flag, a push flag,\na SYN flag, a reset and a FIN flag.\n\n716\n00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:16.640\nThose are the ones that\nare your big ones for scanning.\n\n717\n00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:19.650\nNow, we've already talked\nabout two of those.\n\n718\n00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:24.191\nWe talked about the syn and the ACK and\ntalked about combining the two.\n\n719\n00:38:24.191 --> 00:38:26.948\nWhat you need to think about\nis when a packet goes out,\n\n720\n00:38:26.948 --> 00:38:29.710\na packet has a series of\nswitches that can be set on.\n\n721\n00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.560\nWe're just gonna say there are six\nswitches on the front of a packet.\n\n722\n00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.830\nAnd when that packet goes out,\nthese switches are gonna be set in some\n\n723\n00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:42.910\ncombination that determine how that packet\nwill be processed on the other side.\n\n724\n00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.292\nSo what we have is we have an ad flag,\nwhich is acknowledgment.\n\n725\n00:38:46.292 --> 00:38:48.750\nOkay, that's all it means.\n\n726\n00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:53.450\nWe ave a URG one that tells us that\nthat needs to be processed immediately\n\n727\n00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:56.080\nwhen received.\n\n728\n00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.750\nThen we have push, which is something\nthat will tell the sending system\n\n729\n00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.680\nto send all its data immediately\nbecause the receiving system's\n\n730\n00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:10.030\nsaying I have enough processing power and\nbuffer here to take whatever you've got.\n\n731\n00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.220\nThen we have a SYN,\nwhich is a synchronization request.\n\n732\n00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:15.600\nIt's what we send at\nthe beginning of a connection.\n\n733\n00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.460\nAnd then, we have a reset and a fin,\nwhich are very, very closely related.\n\n734\n00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.980\nSo I really want you to pay attention to\nthe little nuances between these two,\n\n735\n00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.970\ncuz those two can really mess you up.\n\n736\n00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.670\nWhen you look at reset, reset is\nthe equivalent of picking up a phone and\n\n737\n00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.300\ntalking to someone.\n\n738\n00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.785\nAnd when you're done with\nthe conversation, you just click.\n\n739\n00:39:35.785 --> 00:39:37.090\n>> Right.\n\n740\n00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.551\n>> It closes the connection,\nbut it's not very nice.\n\n741\n00:39:40.551 --> 00:39:42.665\n[LAUGH]\n>> It drives you crazy, doesn't it?\n\n742\n00:39:42.665 --> 00:39:44.287\n>> Yeah.\n>> I've got friends that do that, and\n\n743\n00:39:44.287 --> 00:39:46.354\nthey're not trying to be rude,\nit's just what they do.\n\n744\n00:39:46.354 --> 00:39:47.578\nAs soon as the conversation is over,\n\n745\n00:39:47.578 --> 00:39:48.955\nthey're just-\n>> Click.\n\n746\n00:39:48.955 --> 00:39:50.175\n>> That's it.\nI'm like wow, that was kind of-\n\n747\n00:39:50.175 --> 00:39:51.899\n>> It's very abrupt, yeah.\n\n748\n00:39:51.899 --> 00:39:55.302\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I like to say it's not graceful,\n\n749\n00:39:55.302 --> 00:39:57.880\nbut [LAUGH] I'm being kinda nice.\n\n750\n00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.980\nWith my friends, I'm not gonna\nsay well that wasn't graceful.\n\n751\n00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.192\nI'm gonna call back and you'd have to\nmute all this to hear what I said.\n\n752\n00:40:04.192 --> 00:40:07.825\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm just saying.\n\n753\n00:40:07.825 --> 00:40:10.341\nI'm not family friendly in that case.\n\n754\n00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:16.950\nSo But you have that reset,\nwhich is not a graceful end.\n\n755\n00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:19.510\nThen we have a fin which\nis like saying goodbye.\n\n756\n00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.890\nYou're formally saying that\nthis connection's done,\n\n757\n00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.560\nand it needs to be torn down.\n\n758\n00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.630\nSo it's operating at the other end of\nthe spectrum from the three way handshake,\n\n759\n00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:31.790\nwhich gracefully opens a connection.\n\n760\n00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:33.580\nFin gracefully tears it down.\n\n761\n00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.430\nSo that's it, so those are six flags.\n\n762\n00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:43.560\nThose six flags can be combined\nin all different sorts of ways.\n\n763\n00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.990\nAnd that's literally the case,\n\n764\n00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:52.330\ncase is that they can be combined\nin all different sorts of ways.\n\n765\n00:40:52.330 --> 00:40:54.960\nThe thing is that while\nthe specification for\n\n766\n00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.410\nTCP allows them to be\ncombined in different ways,\n\n767\n00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.110\nsome of the ways don't make sense-\n>> Right.\n\n768\n00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.570\n>> When you combine them.\n\n769\n00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:08.586\nIf you look at the flags and send a PUSH,\n\n770\n00:41:08.586 --> 00:41:12.234\nan ERR, a SIN, and a reset.\n\n771\n00:41:12.234 --> 00:41:12.880\n>> Yeah.\n\n772\n00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.650\n>> What does that mean really,\nwhen you get that?\n\n773\n00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.800\nBecause it's crazy.\n\n774\n00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:23.210\nYou're saying you have a sin and\na fin flag in there just for starters.\n\n775\n00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.188\nYou're opening a connection and\nrequesting to close it on the same packet.\n\n776\n00:41:26.188 --> 00:41:28.650\n>> Yeah, right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n777\n00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:29.252\n>> This and\n\n778\n00:41:29.252 --> 00:41:32.133\nthe push, those are telling you to process\ndata in different ways on both ends of\n\n779\n00:41:32.133 --> 00:41:33.720\nthe connection.\n\n780\n00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.470\nSo you're trying to do all\nthis stuff in one, and\n\n781\n00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:40.400\nit can cause some sort of weird\nresult when the system receives it.\n\n782\n00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:46.195\nSo some of those combinations of switches,\nwhile entirely legal, are not gonna\n\n783\n00:41:46.195 --> 00:41:51.025\nbe something that system is gonna know how\nto process correctly or do anything with.\n\n784\n00:41:51.025 --> 00:41:52.005\n>> Which is another thing that could\n\n785\n00:41:52.005 --> 00:41:53.685\nbe used to our advantage\nsometimes as well, right?\n\n786\n00:41:53.685 --> 00:41:57.285\n>> Yeah, some systems will respond to\nthose different combinations in a certain\n\n787\n00:41:57.285 --> 00:41:59.665\nway, some will not respond at all.\n\n788\n00:41:59.665 --> 00:42:03.075\nThere's little things that could start\ngiving it away and that's the reason why,\n\n789\n00:42:03.075 --> 00:42:08.770\nwhen we look at saying they're legal,\nbut they're not logical to do.\n\n790\n00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:10.380\nIt doesn't mean you're\nnot going to use it.\n\n791\n00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:10.920\n>> Right.\n\n792\n00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.630\n>> It doesn't mean you\nwon't use something.\n\n793\n00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:16.770\nThey have things called packet crafters,\nfor example, like Hping, Hping2 and\n\n794\n00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:19.170\n3, for starters.\n\n795\n00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:20.990\nThat you can open it up and\n\n796\n00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:26.557\ncreate a packet with different flags\nset in whatever combination you want.\n\n797\n00:42:26.557 --> 00:42:29.749\nYou can make the packet any size you want,\nand you can fire it off and\n\n798\n00:42:29.749 --> 00:42:31.570\nsee how that system responds.\n\n799\n00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.370\nAnd based on the system response you can\nsay, oh well, this is what's going on,\n\n800\n00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:36.280\nthis is what's going on.\n\n801\n00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.610\nIn fact setting some of those different\ntypes of flags can also be used to\n\n802\n00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:46.390\nfingerprint stuff like firewalls and\nsee if an IDS, which we're\n\n803\n00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:51.210\ngonna about those guys later on, see how\nthose are actually configured and set up.\n\n804\n00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.250\nAnd what they respond to and\nwhat they don't respond to.\n\n805\n00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:53.750\n>> Right.\nRight.\n\n806\n00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.740\nAnd if you've never seen these flags,\nI think it's fascinating.\n\n807\n00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.770\nIt's kinda the geeky side of\nthe networking and stuff, and\n\n808\n00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:06.220\nwe got a whole module, or chapter in\nSean's book that we're gonna talk about.\n\n809\n00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.300\nWhat was it we were gonna\ntalk about in there?\n\n810\n00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:08.900\nSniffers.\n\n811\n00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:13.390\nBut if you've never played\nwith a packet caps utility,\n\n812\n00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:17.500\nlook forward to that chapter, and when we\nget to it, it's great but try them out.\n\n813\n00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.040\nCuz you can actually see these\nflags that we're talking about,\n\n814\n00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.290\nit's not some abstract thing.\n\n815\n00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:24.660\nYou can go in there and\nmost of your packet capture utilities,\n\n816\n00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.500\nwhen you're looking at\nthe raw data in that packet,\n\n817\n00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:28.870\nyou can see the different flags\nthat are turned on and turned off.\n\n818\n00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.000\nSo, this will make a little more sense.\n\n819\n00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.300\nYeah in fact this is a good point\nto say that you're right, yes.\n\n820\n00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:43.850\nA packet sniffer like we're gonna use Wire\nShark that yeah when you turn that on.\n\n821\n00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:48.362\nYou can very easily read the traffic and\nsee the packets flowing across the wire.\n\n822\n00:43:48.362 --> 00:43:50.040\nYou can see the packets flowing across.\n\n823\n00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:52.200\nAnd you can actually read the last column.\n\n824\n00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.000\nAll the flags we just talked about you\ncan say, okay here's these are all TCP.\n\n825\n00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.260\nAnd look over and see the flags being set.\n\n826\n00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:04.030\nIf you know these flags, it's helpful not\njust for scanning, but it's helpful for\n\n827\n00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:06.100\npacket sniffing and other areas.\n\n828\n00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.400\nAnd for those of you taking the test,\nwhich I know there's a lot of you in here\n\n829\n00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:14.170\nthat are planning on taking the test,\nyou will need to be able to do that.\n\n830\n00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.730\nThat is a must have skill.\n\n831\n00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.936\nAnd for\nscanning plus sniffing plus other areas,\n\n832\n00:44:19.936 --> 00:44:23.379\nknowing those flags is gonna\nget you a lot of mileage.\n\n833\n00:44:23.379 --> 00:44:28.080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You only have six to worry about.\n\n834\n00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:31.950\nWe're gonna use them and we're gonna use\nthem a little later on to do a little\n\n835\n00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:36.340\nin a bit to do scans but\nit's not just scans.\n\n836\n00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.860\nIt's other areas as well.\n\n837\n00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:39.885\nSo do remember that.\n\n838\n00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:42.010\nThey're gonna get a lot of mileage.\n\n839\n00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:44.680\nSo it's great to know that.\n\n840\n00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:49.520\n>> All right, so we've got an idea that\ninside our packets that we're sending\n\n841\n00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:52.070\nback and forth, we've got these\nflags out there ahead of this\n\n842\n00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:55.880\npacket that are gonna indicate how\nthat packet should be processed.\n\n843\n00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.710\nSo how do we tie this\nin with our scanning?\n\n844\n00:44:57.710 --> 00:45:03.490\nManipulating these flags in gives me the\nability to do different types of scans or\n\n845\n00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:06.870\nmodify the scans in ways that will\ngive me different results right?\n\n846\n00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:12.470\n>> Yes, that's the key thing here\nis once we know those flags, I gave\n\n847\n00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:17.620\nyou just a little taste a few moments ago\nthat combine the flags in different ways.\n\n848\n00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.610\nAre all possible and legal, but\nsome of them don't make sense.\n\n849\n00:45:21.610 --> 00:45:27.480\nExcuse me, doing a sin and a fin on\nthe exact same packet doesn't make sense,\n\n850\n00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.190\nto open and close a connection\non the exact same thing.\n\n851\n00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.170\nWhile it's legally you can do that,\n\n852\n00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:36.100\nit's not something that a system is\nreally gonna know to respond to.\n\n853\n00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:39.710\nAlthough it may respond to it\nwith the best of intentions,\n\n854\n00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:42.050\nit might try to respond to it.\n\n855\n00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.360\nSo, keep that in mind.\n\n856\n00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:48.750\nNow, typically when we go scan\na system we're gonna see,\n\n857\n00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:51.450\nwhen you scan a system the response or\n\n858\n00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:55.720\nlack of responses in case may be they can\ntell you of a port is open or closed.\n\n859\n00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.050\nYou just have to be familiar\nwith what you expect to see.\n\n860\n00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.220\nNow if the port is closed,\n\n861\n00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:05.450\nwhat's gonna happen and if the port is\nopen it sets a flap what will happen.\n\n862\n00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:10.820\nIf I set a certain flag and\nsend it over a wire to another station,\n\n863\n00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:16.840\nthe response or lack of response can even\ntell me if there's a firewall in between,\n\n864\n00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.155\nor what type of firewall.\n\n865\n00:46:18.155 --> 00:46:22.315\nIt's actually entirely possible\nto do that by firing one packet.\n\n866\n00:46:22.315 --> 00:46:24.727\n>> Hm.\n>> Across the wire to another station.\n\n867\n00:46:24.727 --> 00:46:26.015\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n868\n00:46:26.015 --> 00:46:27.955\nIt really is.\n\n869\n00:46:27.955 --> 00:46:30.627\nSo there's a lot of.\n\n870\n00:46:30.627 --> 00:46:33.677\nThere's a lot of dividends coming\nout of learning this knowledge.\n\n871\n00:46:33.677 --> 00:46:37.837\nSo we're just starting it,\nwe're just seeing how these flags go in.\n\n872\n00:46:37.837 --> 00:46:40.267\nAnd when we fire packets\nof these flags being set,\n\n873\n00:46:40.267 --> 00:46:43.657\nwe're looking at how a station responds,\nto see okay, what port's open?\n\n874\n00:46:43.657 --> 00:46:47.617\nAnd once that port's open, then we\nactually see if we want to enumerate that\n\n875\n00:46:47.617 --> 00:46:50.617\nport, and go behind it to see if there's\nanything listening on that port,\n\n876\n00:46:50.617 --> 00:46:52.170\nany service listening on it.\n\n877\n00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:55.420\nAnd see if we can attract usernames and\nbanners and stuff like that.\n\n878\n00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.050\nSo, we're starting to open doors\nhere with something like this.\n\n879\n00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:00.390\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n880\n00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:01.580\nAll right, well I tell you what.\n\n881\n00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.470\nLooking at the clock,\nit's close to our break time.\n\n882\n00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:07.090\nAnd I know the next thing we're gonna get\ninto, we got a few things to go over.\n\n883\n00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.780\nSo why don't we call this one just a hair\nearly, go ahead and take our break.\n\n884\n00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:15.670\nAnd when we come back we can dive into the\ndifferent types of scans that we can do\n\n885\n00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:18.830\nby changing the flags\nthat are turned on or\n\n886\n00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:22.490\nturned off within these packets that\nwe're sending out on our scans.\n\n887\n00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:23.720\nAll right so stay tuned.\n\n888\n00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.530\nWe'll be right back.\n\n889\n00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.910\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n890\n00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.870\nSo we left off talking\nabout types of scans.\n\n891\n00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:39.290\nWe went over a lot of information about,\nyou know,\n\n892\n00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.580\nI even lost track of what\nJoe was talking about.\n\n893\n00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:44.720\nTCB and UDP and\nwe talked a lot about the flag.\n\n894\n00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.140\nWe went over the different flags and\nI want to take a look at.\n\n895\n00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.570\nSo we know what these flags are.\n\n896\n00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.930\nWhat is it going to do to my scan if\nI start manipulating these flags,\n\n897\n00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:56.700\nand what can I do by\nmanipulating those flags?\n\n898\n00:47:56.700 --> 00:47:59.090\nHow can I interpret those results?\n\n899\n00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:03.953\n>> Yes, that's the skill that we have\nto work on is when you know these flags\n\n900\n00:48:03.953 --> 00:48:08.529\nare ready, and you start doing\nscans what does that actually mean?\n\n901\n00:48:08.529 --> 00:48:10.792\nWhat's going to actually\nhappen on a system?\n\n902\n00:48:10.792 --> 00:48:16.560\nWell to do that we kinda, one of the tools\nwe're gonna use is actually Nmap.\n\n903\n00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:22.140\nWe're gonna use that and we're gonna look\nat it a little bit more in depth later.\n\n904\n00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.412\nInitially, what we're gonna do is we're\nuse Nmap to do some basic scans of all\n\n905\n00:48:26.412 --> 00:48:27.719\ndifferent types here.\n\n906\n00:48:27.719 --> 00:48:32.144\nAnd I'm going to show you what\nthe different scans look like and\n\n907\n00:48:32.144 --> 00:48:36.485\nthe different switches you set\nbecause those are key skills,\n\n908\n00:48:36.485 --> 00:48:40.763\nkey testable items as well and\nyou are going to be using them.\n\n909\n00:48:40.763 --> 00:48:41.889\nYou are going to be using them.\n\n910\n00:48:41.889 --> 00:48:43.890\nIt's just the long and the short of it.\n\n911\n00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:46.000\nYou're gonna be using these things.\n\n912\n00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.060\nSo we'll talk about the scans and what you\nexpect to see, and what you shouldn't see.\n\n913\n00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:55.226\nAnd then we'll kind of go through\nwhat some of the switches are for\n\n914\n00:48:55.226 --> 00:48:56.451\neach one of these.\n\n915\n00:48:56.451 --> 00:48:57.660\n>> Okay.\n\n916\n00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:01.780\n>> So, talking about our first type\nof scan that we have available,\n\n917\n00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.810\nwe have a full open scan.\n\n918\n00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.610\nThat's gonna be the first one on our list,\nit's the most basic one as well.\n\n919\n00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:13.650\nA full open scan, they call it that but\nyou've already seen it.\n\n920\n00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.848\nYou really don't need\nme to tell you what is.\n\n921\n00:49:15.848 --> 00:49:17.322\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, quite frankly.\n\n922\n00:49:17.322 --> 00:49:22.883\nA full open scan means you're\ncompleting a three-way handshake.\n\n923\n00:49:22.883 --> 00:49:26.032\nAnd you make connections to\nthe various ports on a system,\n\n924\n00:49:26.032 --> 00:49:28.421\nyou are doing a full three-way handshake.\n\n925\n00:49:28.421 --> 00:49:31.565\nAnd by the way we should\nalso say that the scans,\n\n926\n00:49:31.565 --> 00:49:35.188\nuntil we tell you otherwise,\nthese are all TCP scans.\n\n927\n00:49:35.188 --> 00:49:39.155\nThese aren't UDP,\nthese are purely TCP scans.\n\n928\n00:49:39.155 --> 00:49:43.485\nSo when we look at a full open scan,\n\n929\n00:49:43.485 --> 00:49:47.415\nwe are talking about completing\nthat three-way handshake.\n\n930\n00:49:47.415 --> 00:49:49.325\nSo it means that connection is fully open.\n\n931\n00:49:49.325 --> 00:49:50.785\nIf you complete three-way handshake,\n\n932\n00:49:50.785 --> 00:49:55.240\nyou have a fully opened and\nconfirmed connection.\n\n933\n00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.543\nSo that's the first thing\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n934\n00:49:58.543 --> 00:50:01.666\n>> And we're not doing that\nto just one port or one IP.\n\n935\n00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.479\nRemember, we're talking about ports here,\n\n936\n00:50:03.479 --> 00:50:05.392\nso we're going through\neach one of those ports.\n\n937\n00:50:05.392 --> 00:50:09.897\nAnd depending on the tool you're using,\nyou can limit what ports you're actually\n\n938\n00:50:09.897 --> 00:50:13.321\ntesting or you can do all\n65,535 if you have enough time.\n\n939\n00:50:13.321 --> 00:50:15.525\nBut we're hitting that\nfirst port on our list and\n\n940\n00:50:15.525 --> 00:50:17.910\nwe're attempting to make\na three-way handshake.\n\n941\n00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:18.800\nAnd then we're seeing the results.\n\n942\n00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.350\nAnd then we're going to the next port, and\n\n943\n00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:21.820\nwe're attempting to make\na three-way handshake.\n\n944\n00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.650\nAnd then we're resetting that,\nand going back to the next one.\n\n945\n00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:27.992\nSo talking about going through those ports\nthat we want to determine whether or\n\n946\n00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:29.647\nnot they're open or closed.\n\n947\n00:50:29.647 --> 00:50:30.540\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n948\n00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.766\nYou can go into really any scanning tool.\n\n949\n00:50:34.766 --> 00:50:39.012\nEven though we're going to use\nNmap as our weapon of choice,\n\n950\n00:50:39.012 --> 00:50:42.270\nthere are plenty of\nscanning tools out there.\n\n951\n00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:45.430\nSome people out there don't like Nmap.\n\n952\n00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:48.812\nThere's always somebody who\ndoesn't like a piece of software,\n\n953\n00:50:48.812 --> 00:50:50.420\nwants to go against the grain.\n\n954\n00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:51.941\nWe call those Apple users.\n\n955\n00:50:51.941 --> 00:50:52.592\nNo, no, I'm kidding.\n\n956\n00:50:52.592 --> 00:50:57.602\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, sorry.\n\n957\n00:50:57.602 --> 00:50:59.007\nShot right in there.\n\n958\n00:50:59.007 --> 00:51:01.724\nAll right, you guys can deal with it.\n\n959\n00:51:01.724 --> 00:51:04.914\nSo-\n>> In fairness, Nmaps a great,\n\n960\n00:51:04.914 --> 00:51:08.534\nlike we called earlier,\nthe swiss army knife of hacking tools.\n\n961\n00:51:08.534 --> 00:51:09.990\nIt does so much.\n\n962\n00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:12.870\nIt's also a Linux based tool.\n\n963\n00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:15.910\nThere is a Windows port for it,\nbut some people tell you that that\n\n964\n00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:19.980\nIs a little bit clunky, or\nsometimes it gets a little flaky.\n\n965\n00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.804\nSo, if you're on a Windows platform,\n\n966\n00:51:21.804 --> 00:51:25.233\nyou might very well find another tool\nthat maybe you like a little better,\n\n967\n00:51:25.233 --> 00:51:29.020\nbut, as you were saying earlier, it's\nfun working with the command line, so.\n\n968\n00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.981\nGets you that distro of Kali or\nan old back tracks or something, and\n\n969\n00:51:33.981 --> 00:51:35.940\ndo some Nmap, it's fun.\n\n970\n00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.403\nI'm telling you, you'll like it.\n\n971\n00:51:37.403 --> 00:51:39.340\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n972\n00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:41.110\nAnd just to be fair,\n\n973\n00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:46.510\nI made a joke about Apple users on there,\nNmaps a cross platform too.\n\n974\n00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:48.710\nThat's kinda what that leads to.\n\n975\n00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:55.100\nYeah, it started on Linux, it's gone to,\nit's on Windows, it's on UNIX.\n\n976\n00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.330\nYou can find a lot of places.\n\n977\n00:51:57.330 --> 00:52:00.360\nThey even have it for\nthe Android operating system now.\n\n978\n00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:03.420\n>> And James is saying out there in\nthe chat room that there is a port for\n\n979\n00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.071\nthe Mac OS as well so-\n>> There you go.\n\n980\n00:52:05.071 --> 00:52:05.930\n>> There you go.\n\n981\n00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.171\nNap will work on anything.\n\n982\n00:52:08.171 --> 00:52:10.215\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n983\n00:52:10.215 --> 00:52:14.603\nit’s a very valuable tool\nto have in your arsenal.\n\n984\n00:52:14.603 --> 00:52:20.627\nI wouldn’t just kinda say,\nto shine off on it or anything like that.\n\n985\n00:52:20.627 --> 00:52:22.624\nIt is a good utility.\n\n986\n00:52:22.624 --> 00:52:26.730\nAll the skills, why I'm going to\nbe demonstrating them in Windows.\n\n987\n00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:29.828\nYou can use these skills across platform,\ncuz the switches and\n\n988\n00:52:29.828 --> 00:52:32.297\nall are the same no matter\nwhat platform you go to.\n\n989\n00:52:32.297 --> 00:52:35.002\n>> Yeah, and keep in mind too,\nfor the exam.\n\n990\n00:52:35.002 --> 00:52:39.832\nThere's several tools we can use, but\non the exam they'll kind of use one and\n\n991\n00:52:39.832 --> 00:52:40.959\nNmap is that one.\n\n992\n00:52:40.959 --> 00:52:42.698\n>> Yeah,\nit's the best of breed is what it is.\n\n993\n00:52:42.698 --> 00:52:46.503\n>> Yeah, for the exam you need to\nknow how, from the command line,\n\n994\n00:52:46.503 --> 00:52:50.397\nhow do I run this type of scan for\nthese ports using these options?\n\n995\n00:52:50.397 --> 00:52:51.630\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n996\n00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:57.160\nSo what I like to look at when I\npick out any tool is I like to use\n\n997\n00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.110\nthe best of breed.\n\n998\n00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:01.094\nAnd to me, Nmap's the best of breed, and\n\n999\n00:53:01.094 --> 00:53:03.602\nthere's a lot of people\nthat would agree with that.\n\n1000\n00:53:03.602 --> 00:53:05.971\nYou may not, but that's fine.\n\n1001\n00:53:05.971 --> 00:53:07.585\nFind something that works for you.\n\n1002\n00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:11.369\nThe important thing is understanding\nthe scans we're gonna talk about.\n\n1003\n00:53:11.369 --> 00:53:16.228\nOnce you understand the scans, you can\ngo to a lot of different scanners and\n\n1004\n00:53:16.228 --> 00:53:18.709\nuse the same tools and understand it.\n\n1005\n00:53:18.709 --> 00:53:24.963\n>> So, but going through, so\nwe talked about the full open scan.\n\n1006\n00:53:24.963 --> 00:53:29.563\nThe full open scan, what would you expect\nto see as the important thing when we're\n\n1007\n00:53:29.563 --> 00:53:33.770\nscanning the system and\ngoing against a specific port on a system?\n\n1008\n00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:35.370\nWhat are you gonna get out of that?\n\n1009\n00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:38.538\nWell, what you're gonna get out\nof it is if a port is open,\n\n1010\n00:53:38.538 --> 00:53:41.980\nyou're gonna be able to complete\nthat three-way handshake.\n\n1011\n00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:46.612\nYou're gonna get the SYN ACK and you'll\nbe able to ACK back and boom, done, open.\n\n1012\n00:53:46.612 --> 00:53:48.680\nYou've got direct confirmation.\n\n1013\n00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.559\nAnd if the port is closed,\nthat's the question.\n\n1014\n00:53:51.559 --> 00:53:54.030\nIf a port's closed, what do you get back?\n\n1015\n00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:57.290\nIt's not supposed to be accepting\nconnections if its closed.\n\n1016\n00:53:57.290 --> 00:54:00.070\nBut you will get something back.\n\n1017\n00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:02.720\nThat thing you get back\nis gonna be a reset.\n\n1018\n00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.940\nYou'll get a RST packet coming back, that\ngoes out and just fires something back and\n\n1019\n00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:11.010\nkills that connection, saying,\nI'm not taking connections.\n\n1020\n00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:15.570\nSo, what you get back will\ntell you what's going on.\n\n1021\n00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:19.863\nNow, you may have that obscured\n\n1022\n00:54:19.863 --> 00:54:24.848\nfrom you in certain scanners\nbecause what they'll do\n\n1023\n00:54:24.848 --> 00:54:28.010\nis a scanner will read those\nsame packets coming back and\n\n1024\n00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:31.495\nwill just tell you based on what it\ngets back if that's open or closed.\n\n1025\n00:54:31.495 --> 00:54:35.731\nNmap, for example, unless you ask for\nit, isn't gonna tell you, oh,\n\n1026\n00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:38.517\nI gotta reset from this and\nI got this from this.\n\n1027\n00:54:38.517 --> 00:54:41.445\nIt's just gonna say, hey,\nit got a reset back,\n\n1028\n00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:43.810\nit'll tell you that the ports closed.\n\n1029\n00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.120\nThat's all you need to know.\n\n1030\n00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:52.640\nBut you could actually dig in and\nsee that information if you wanted to.\n\n1031\n00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.478\nBut anyway,\nthat's the full open connection.\n\n1032\n00:54:56.478 --> 00:55:01.524\nIf you do a full open connection,\nyou will actually see either nothing or\n\n1033\n00:55:01.524 --> 00:55:06.610\nyou'll see the reset packet telling\nyou if it's open or closed.\n\n1034\n00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:09.582\nThe thing to remember, word of\ncaution if you do a full open scan.\n\n1035\n00:55:09.582 --> 00:55:12.516\nIt sounds like great\nbecause you're getting,\n\n1036\n00:55:12.516 --> 00:55:16.020\na full open scan gives you\nthe best possible result.\n\n1037\n00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:20.811\nWhich is telling you immediately if\nthat ports open or if it's closed.\n\n1038\n00:55:20.811 --> 00:55:22.982\nBut you're paying for that.\n\n1039\n00:55:22.982 --> 00:55:25.400\nYou're definitely paying for that.\n\n1040\n00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.210\nThey know you're coming.\n\n1041\n00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.830\nYou've just given them everything\nthey need to know you're coming.\n\n1042\n00:55:29.830 --> 00:55:34.661\nSo the defender on that side is gonna see\non their firewall, on their firewall logs,\n\n1043\n00:55:34.661 --> 00:55:36.712\nor they're gonna see in their IDS.\n\n1044\n00:55:36.712 --> 00:55:40.853\nThey're gonna see those little signatures,\nand if you're sending a lot of probes out\n\n1045\n00:55:40.853 --> 00:55:44.387\nto ports, they're going to see a lot\nof them coming from your IP address.\n\n1046\n00:55:44.387 --> 00:55:49.270\nAnd they can easily interpret to that\nto say yeah, that's a sweep going on.\n\n1047\n00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:51.070\nThe person's trying to\ndetermine what ports are open.\n\n1048\n00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:56.116\nAnd at that point,\nthey could block your IP address.\n\n1049\n00:55:56.116 --> 00:55:57.820\nBut they've got direct confirmation.\n\n1050\n00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.187\nI mean it's equivalent to going to\nsomeone's door and going, hello,\n\n1051\n00:56:00.187 --> 00:56:00.747\nhello, hello.\n\n1052\n00:56:00.747 --> 00:56:01.861\nThey know that.\n\n1053\n00:56:01.861 --> 00:56:02.534\nThey're seeing everything they need to.\n\n1054\n00:56:02.534 --> 00:56:05.601\n>> That's right, going to every single\nwindow in that house and tapping going,\n\n1055\n00:56:05.601 --> 00:56:06.353\nanybody in there?\n\n1056\n00:56:06.353 --> 00:56:06.992\nTap, tap, tap.\n\n1057\n00:56:06.992 --> 00:56:08.710\nAnybody in there?\n\n1058\n00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.091\nIf somebody's in there,\nthey're gonna know.\n\n1059\n00:56:10.091 --> 00:56:11.891\nAnd most systems are logging right?\n\n1060\n00:56:11.891 --> 00:56:13.865\nOur firewalls are definitely logging.\n\n1061\n00:56:13.865 --> 00:56:18.080\nProbably on the systems if they know\nit's a system of interest to people.\n\n1062\n00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.500\nThey're going to be logging and\nyou just made their log file.\n\n1063\n00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:24.420\nSo while best results a little\nbit of what we call noisy right.\n\n1064\n00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.370\nSo you can end up setting off one\nof those intrusion protection or\n\n1065\n00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.050\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n1066\n00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:32.770\nYou're definitely going\nto be on the log there.\n\n1067\n00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:37.540\nNow there's ways we can mitigate\nsome of that risk, right?\n\n1068\n00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:38.890\n>> Yes.\n\n1069\n00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:41.960\n>> What can we do to maybe try to\nprevent setting off some of those-\n\n1070\n00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.040\n>> Well you can choose to use a less\n\n1071\n00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.480\nnoisy scan.\n\n1072\n00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.680\nThat would be the big one.\n\n1073\n00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:49.470\nOr-\n>> But\n\n1074\n00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:52.350\nif we're staying with that open

00:56:58.250\nThere are ways, and\nthat's a very good point,\n\n1078\n00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:02.960\nis that one of the things we talked\nabout on our first show or two.\n\n1079\n00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.490\nOne of the things we talked about,\nan intangible skill was, patience.\n\n1080\n00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:08.760\nYou know, patience, Grasshopper.\n\n1081\n00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.823\nYou must learn patience.\n\n1082\n00:57:09.823 --> 00:57:11.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> We want those results right now.\n\n1083\n00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:15.230\nI'm hitting the system,\nI took all

there so\n\n1086\n00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:23.794\nI'm just gonna hammer away with\na full open scan on all those ports.\n\n1087\n00:57:23.794 --> 00:57:25.823\nNo, no, no ,no.\n\n1088\n00:57:25.823 --> 00:57:30.820\n>> Yeah, you have to be patient,\nbecause if they see a big concentration\n\n1089\n00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:35.370\ncoming in over a very short period of\ntime, that's not a usual activity.\n\n1090\n00:57:35.370 --> 00:57:36.930\nThat's very abnormal.\n\n1091\n00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:42.250\nIf you stretch it out,\nit becomes harder and harder to detect.\n\n1092\n00:57:42.250 --> 00:57:46.320\nIt still could be detected if someone\nis doing the right things, but\n\n1093\n00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:51.495\nit becomes tougher because it's not\nthat burst coming in at one time,\n\n1094\n00:57:51.495 --> 00:57:56.525\nit's stretched out so they have to look\nover a very long period of time or\n\n1095\n00:57:56.525 --> 00:58:00.960\na longer period of time to actually\nstart discerning that pattern.\n\n1096\n00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:04.140\nAnd over that same time there's\nother traffic coming in that\n\n1097\n00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:08.740\nyou may be hiding amongst, so\nit makes it much much better.\n\n1098\n00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:11.560\n>> Yeah so we can slow that thing down and\nnot send them every,\n\n1099\n00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:14.840\ncuz in computer time if they're\nfiring off as fast as you'll let it,\n\n1100\n00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:17.090\nit'll scan through those\nports pretty darn quick.\n\n1101\n00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:22.080\nWe start putting 2, 3, 5, 10, 20,\nseconds between each one of those and\n\n1102\n00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.700\nas you said other packets\nare now going in between ours so\n\n1103\n00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:28.580\nwe're not consecutive IP\naddresses in their log files and\n\n1104\n00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:33.160\nmaybe that slows that or prevents\nthem from detecting us right away.\n\n1105\n00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.270\nOtherwise even ISPs can start picking\nup those ping sweeps if you're\n\n1106\n00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:39.100\ndoing many of them and\ndoing very rapidly like that.\n\n1107\n00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:40.020\n>> Yeah, that's the thing.\n\n1108\n00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:44.100\nAn ISP will be looking for\nthis sort of thing.\n\n1109\n00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.960\nThey'll pick this stuff up and say,\nokay, there's something going on.\n\n1110\n00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.065\nAnd in some cases they'll\nshut down your connection and\n\n1111\n00:58:50.065 --> 00:58:51.241\nthen you'll get a phone call.\n\n1112\n00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:51.742\n>> Yes.\n\n1113\n00:58:51.742 --> 00:58:52.492\nAbsolutely.\n\n1114\n00:58:52.492 --> 00:58:57.336\n>> They've even been known to say\nif you do it again we'll shut down\n\n1115\n00:58:57.336 --> 00:58:58.790\nyour connection.\n\n1116\n00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:01.050\nThey usually would give you some chances.\n\n1117\n00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:03.130\nAnd say,\nusually it's always the three strike rule.\n\n1118\n00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:04.260\n>> Yeah.\n>> They'll see it and\n\n1119\n00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.575\nthen they'll say well\n>> You can plead ignorant on that first\n\n1120\n00:59:07.575 --> 00:59:08.330\ntry, maybe.\n\n1121\n00:59:08.330 --> 00:59:11.200\nSay well, I was just found this tool and\nI was playing around with it.\n\n1122\n00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.157\nI didn't know what I was doing.\n\n1123\n00:59:12.157 --> 00:59:13.209\nThe second, the third time,\n\n1124\n00:59:13.209 --> 00:59:15.323\nit's gonna be a little bit\nharder to convince them of that.\n\n1125\n00:59:15.323 --> 00:59:17.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1126\n00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.190\nSo.\n>> So, you gonna show us one?\n\n1127\n00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:21.230\nOr you want to talk about the rest\nof them before we dive in?\n\n1128\n00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:27.050\n>> Yeah, let’s take a look at one of these\nscan types, I’m going to put one up around\n\n1129\n00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:32.210\nscreen and maybe we can zoom in a bit more\nand show you a little better look at it.\n\n1130\n00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:38.000\nWhat I have here in my command prompt is\nyou can see I’ve done N map which is,\n\n1131\n00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:42.290\nN map by way is command line and\nyou can get a gooey for it.\n\n1132\n00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:46.270\nWhat you're seeing over here on the right\nhand side which I'm going to use more\n\n1133\n00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:48.880\nlater, right now,\n\n1134\n00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.830\nsince it's more important that you know\nthe command line, than it is the gooey.\n\n1135\n00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:58.480\nI'm just going to go ahead and\nuse the command line to illustrate.stuff.\n\n1136\n00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.600\nFor your exam, you're going to\nneed to know the command line.\n\n1137\n01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.770\nFor practical purposes, knowing\nthe command line's never a bad thing.\n\n1138\n01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.710\nBecause you may not get that gooey.\n\n1139\n01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:14.531\nYou may just have the command line, and\ndepending on the OS you're doing this on,\n\n1140\n01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:17.860\nthat gooey may be a mess or whatever.\n\n1141\n01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.600\nI've seen all sorts of things.\n\n1142\n01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.300\n>> Then for awhile, I thought that\nthe gooey disappeared for Windows,\n\n1143\n01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:24.320\nthen it came back with a Zenmap.\n\n1144\n01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:28.240\n>> Yeah they have just\nkind of a kludge for\n\n1145\n01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.740\na, is the best way to put it,\nfor the gooey.\n\n1146\n01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.160\nAnd it was just really rough.\n\n1147\n01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.750\nAnd that's why it went away briefly.\n\n1148\n01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.940\nHe had it actually as a separate download.\n\n1149\n01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:40.630\nWhen I say he,\n\n1150\n01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:45.430\nthe individual that wrote this is\na guy that goes by the name of Fyodor.\n\n1151\n01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:48.380\nHe's got a real name, but\neveryone goes by Fyodor for him.\n\n1152\n01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.600\nHe's written books on this.\n\n1153\n01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.570\nThere's a lot of free documentation\non this since it's so powerful.\n\n1154\n01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:58.830\nBut, he had that gooey available\nas a separate download.\n\n1155\n01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:02.730\nNow he bundles Zenmap and Nmap together so\n\n1156\n01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:04.880\nyou can use whichever one\nyou're most comfortable with.\n\n1157\n01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:10.830\nSo what I have on my screen,\nif you look really closely at it,\n\n1158\n01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:15.370\nwhat you're seeing is you're seeing,\non my command line you're seeing Nmap.\n\n1159\n01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:17.990\nThen space minus ST.\n\n1160\n01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:20.900\nThat's the switch for\ndoing a full open scan.\n\n1161\n01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.630\nAnd then you can have an IP address.\n\n1162\n01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:28.880\nNow I just stuck my loopback\naddress in to keep things simple.\n\n1163\n01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.440\nBut that scan, will work,\nscanning into my system.\n\n1164\n01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.180\nI'm not going to bother\nnecessarily running it at\n\n1165\n01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:39.000\nthis point because it doesn't necessarily\nget the best results when you scan\n\n1166\n01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.590\nyour own system with something like this.\n\n1167\n01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:43.540\nBut that would work.\n\n1168\n01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.120\nI can replace it with a different\nIP address and get it to do that.\n\n1169\n01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.740\nIf I can get you to do\nthe scan if I wanted.\n\n1170\n01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:54.031\nAbout let me tell you a couple\ntricks on here too, by the way.\n\n1171\n01:01:54.031 --> 01:01:57.248\nWhen you go and you see this up here,\n\n1172\n01:01:57.248 --> 01:02:02.949\nwhen I put in my IP address up there,\nyou can see I have the .1.\n\n1173\n01:02:02.949 --> 01:02:06.384\nAnd I'm just gonna assume that that's\nsomething other than a loop back address,\n\n1174\n01:02:06.384 --> 01:02:07.698\nthat I have indeed hit a range.\n\n1175\n01:02:07.698 --> 01:02:08.574\n>> You can use mine if you want.\n\n1176\n01:02:08.574 --> 01:02:10.074\nI don't know if you want\nto bother with that.\n\n1177\n01:02:10.074 --> 01:02:11.574\n>> Oh sure.\n\n1178\n01:02:11.574 --> 01:02:12.408\nWhat do you got for an IP address?\n\n1179\n01:02:12.408 --> 01:02:15.366\n>> 10.1.230.98.\n\n1180\n01:02:15.366 --> 01:02:17.532\n10.1.230.\n\n1181\n01:02:17.532 --> 01:02:19.491\n>> 98.\n\n1182\n01:02:19.491 --> 01:02:20.032\nOkay.\n\n1183\n01:02:20.032 --> 01:02:22.406\nLet's see what we got.\n\n1184\n01:02:22.406 --> 01:02:23.782\nYou guys saw it, he said it was okay.\n\n1185\n01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:29.157\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, let's see what it gets.\n\n1186\n01:02:29.157 --> 01:02:30.875\n>> We'll let that run for a second.\n\n1187\n01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:34.225\nAnd while we're waiting for that to run,\nKevin asked how much of the switches\n\n1188\n01:02:34.225 --> 01:02:37.309\nare testable for Nmap in CEH,\nand I'd say most of them, right?\n\n1189\n01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:43.800\n>> I would say for what we're talking\nabout here, all the ones that we're gonna\n\n1190\n01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:50.090\nsee here, the different types of scans,\nall of those are testable.\n\n1191\n01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:51.610\nSo be prepared for those.\n\n1192\n01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:52.584\nYou're gonna see and\n\n1193\n01:02:52.584 --> 01:02:57.120\nthen be prepared for the one on a ping\nsweep, you're gonna need to know that.\n\n1194\n01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.240\nSo they're pretty basic.\n\n1195\n01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:05.290\nThere's actually a huge number of\nscans that are available with this.\n\n1196\n01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:11.660\nBut you don't need to know every\nswitch because you couldn't really.\n\n1197\n01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.180\nBut expect the ones for the,\nset the different types of scans,\n\n1198\n01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:17.360\nexpect those to be tested.\n\n1199\n01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.940\n>> I'll see if I can't work up\na little cheat sheet for everybody.\n\n1200\n01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:22.847\nIf anybody has one already, feel free\nto post it out there in the chat,\n\n1201\n01:03:22.847 --> 01:03:23.949\nif you haven't already.\n\n1202\n01:03:23.949 --> 01:03:28.173\nAnd I'll work up one that includes all\nthe switches that Sean goes through in\n\n1203\n01:03:28.173 --> 01:03:31.617\nhis book, which are going to\ndefinitely your testable ones.\n\n1204\n01:03:31.617 --> 01:03:37.220\n>> Yeah, if you have the book,\nI've got all the switches in there.\n\n1205\n01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:40.740\nThat I believe are all testable.\n\n1206\n01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.780\nI say believe because, you know, a,\n\n1207\n01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:46.030\nI don't know what they're going to put on\nyour conversion of the exam because they\n\n1208\n01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:51.610\ndo alter that pool and I can't tell\nyou what's gonna be on there either.\n\n1209\n01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:55.320\nSo, all the ones I put in the book\nI believe are fair game, and\n\n1210\n01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.910\nso you're gonna want to maybe\ntake a closer look at those.\n\n1211\n01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:00.940\n>> Okay.\n\n1212\n01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:04.884\n>> All right, so,\nwe've got some results here.\n\n1213\n01:04:04.884 --> 01:04:08.065\nAnd this is some really cool\nstuff that we're seeing.\n\n1214\n01:04:08.065 --> 01:04:14.206\nWe've scanned your IP address over your\nMike, so we've got We've got some results.\n\n1215\n01:04:14.206 --> 01:04:17.050\nWhat we see here are just the open ports.\n\n1216\n01:04:17.050 --> 01:04:17.690\nSo what do we have?\n\n1217\n01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:20.415\nLooks like seven open\nports on your system.\n\n1218\n01:04:20.415 --> 01:04:21.370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1219\n01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:23.490\n>> Two of them are unknown.\n\n1220\n01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:25.104\nSo, okay.\nThat's fine.\n\n1221\n01:04:25.104 --> 01:04:29.850\nIt means there's something there, but it\ncouldn't exactly fingerprint that service.\n\n1222\n01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:32.970\nThe other ones,\nwe see identifications for.\n\n1223\n01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:35.250\nIt looks like one for VM, WS API.\n\n1224\n01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:40.405\nThere's a NetBIOS one open,\nmore on that one later.\n\n1225\n01:04:40.405 --> 01:04:42.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then,\n\n1226\n01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:47.390\nwe see some other stuff that we'll\nworry about when the time comes.\n\n1227\n01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:48.108\n>> Right.\n>> So-\n\n1228\n01:04:48.108 --> 01:04:49.476\n>> And you didn't do any\n\n1229\n01:04:49.476 --> 01:04:52.900\ntype of limitations on what\nyou were scanning there.\n\n1230\n01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.940\nYou did a full open scan and\nwe didn't specify cuz you can specify\n\n1231\n01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:58.450\nport ranges and the options there,\nand things like that.\n\n1232\n01:04:58.450 --> 01:05:03.111\nSo you did all, it did not take that long,\nand you did all 65,535 ports in that case.\n\n1233\n01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:05.900\n>> Yeah, it just went ahead and\nscanned it all.\n\n1234\n01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:07.460\nAnd yes, you can limit it.\n\n1235\n01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.550\nThat's why it took longer.\n\n1236\n01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:12.020\nYou saw, it didn't come back right away.\n\n1237\n01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.000\nIt took some time.\n\n1238\n01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.740\nIt was going right on down the list.\n\n1239\n01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:17.890\nIt took so long,\nnot just because the number of IPs, or\n\n1240\n01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:19.800\nthe number of ports it was scanning, but\n\n1241\n01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.630\nalso because it has to do a three-way\nhandshake with every one of them.\n\n1242\n01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:26.610\nAnd so, it's going to the one doing it,\nthen the next one and doing it.\n\n1243\n01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:32.590\nAnd so, that takes some time,\nbut we have results now.\n\n1244\n01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:37.467\nThis would be something that we could\nuse to say, okay, well note this for\n\n1245\n01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:38.654\nthis IP address.\n\n1246\n01:05:38.654 --> 01:05:41.709\nThere's things we can\ntarget a little bit better.\n\n1247\n01:05:45.673 --> 01:05:48.447\nGee, I see over here, Michael saying-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1248\n01:05:48.447 --> 01:05:51.825\n>> We allow the dash help option.\n\n1249\n01:05:51.825 --> 01:05:55.275\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, sure, feel free to try that.\n\n1250\n01:05:55.275 --> 01:05:56.680\n[LAUGH]\n>> Wouldn't that be nice?\n\n1251\n01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:01.050\nUnfortunately, typically,\nthey're giving you four.\n\n1252\n01:06:01.050 --> 01:06:02.040\nIf it's a multiple choice,\n\n1253\n01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.010\nthey're gonna give you four lines of what\nyou would be typing in the command prompt.\n\n1254\n01:06:06.010 --> 01:06:11.960\nWhich command would you type to perform\na half open scan on the well known port?\n\n1255\n01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.920\nOr something like that.\n\n1256\n01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.592\nYou gotta pick the right commands.\n\n1257\n01:06:13.592 --> 01:06:17.138\nYou're not typing it in and you don't\nhave a functioning end map running,\n\n1258\n01:06:17.138 --> 01:06:19.570\nso the dash help isn't gonna\nhelp you in this case.\n\n1259\n01:06:19.570 --> 01:06:21.629\n>> Yeah, so I wouldn't do that.\nAnd maybe you're kidding on that,\n\n1260\n01:06:21.629 --> 01:06:22.327\nI don't know.\n\n1261\n01:06:22.327 --> 01:06:23.384\n>> Yeah, I understand.\n\n1262\n01:06:23.384 --> 01:06:26.600\n>> But yeah, don't expect them\nto give you an e-console.\n\n1263\n01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.730\nThey're either gonna\ngive you multiple choice.\n\n1264\n01:06:28.730 --> 01:06:32.070\nOr, it's possible they could give you\nsomething like I've got on my screen here,\n\n1265\n01:06:32.070 --> 01:06:32.950\na command prompt.\n\n1266\n01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:37.710\nThey could show you that and say and\nsay okay, well, what type of scan is this?\n\n1267\n01:06:37.710 --> 01:06:40.650\nThe key to it is looking right up\nthere up top and knowing the switches.\n\n1268\n01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:44.620\nAnd you can see right away what\ntype of thing is going on.\n\n1269\n01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.660\n>> And do be careful with that.\n\n1270\n01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.110\nJames down in the chatroom\nsaid that by default,\n\n1271\n01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:52.840\nZenmap only scans the registered\nports 1 through 1023.\n\n1272\n01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.750\nThe GUI, I think, defaults to that.\n\n1273\n01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:58.550\nZenmap, I think, has some checkmarks\non those well-known ports.\n\n1274\n01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:02.460\nBut as you can see here, he did no\nfiltering at all, no, and it scanned all.\n\n1275\n01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:04.920\nYou can see some of those\nports are in my dynamic range.\n\n1276\n01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.150\nI think in my results,\nI've got some 49,000s up there?\n\n1277\n01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.780\n>> Yeah.\n\n1278\n01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:15.590\n>> So it doesn't default to just those\nwell known ports or the register ports.\n\n1279\n01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:20.401\n>> Yeah, it's not necessarily, James,\nthat you're 100% wrong on that.\n\n1280\n01:07:20.401 --> 01:07:22.390\nThat can change depending\non the situation.\n\n1281\n01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:23.250\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1282\n01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.599\nSo yeah, just be aware of that.\n\n1283\n01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:28.907\nIt's a good point to bring up\nbecause it allows us to say yeah,\n\n1284\n01:07:28.907 --> 01:07:31.210\nthere could be some differences in there.\n\n1285\n01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:35.110\n>> Exactly, cuz like I said,\nI'm pretty sure when you go into Zenmap,\n\n1286\n01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:37.220\nit does have some filters\nturned on by default.\n\n1287\n01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.890\nThat does control that,\nso different platforms,\n\n1288\n01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:42.720\ndifferent ports of that tool\nmight have different defaults.\n\n1289\n01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.270\nSo we just don't wanna be too\ngeneral with that statement.\n\n1290\n01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:46.310\n>> Yeah, okay.\n\n1291\n01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:51.430\nSo, but anyway, that's the full open one.\n\n1292\n01:07:52.510 --> 01:08:00.000\nWe got time to take a look at its cousin,\nwhich is the half open scan.\n\n1293\n01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.410\nThe half open scan changes\nthings just a bit.\n\n1294\n01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:07.340\nWhat the half open scan looks like is.\n\n1295\n01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.940\nAnd this is what I want you\nguys to pay attention to.\n\n1296\n01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:15.850\nThis is kind of the key to it to\nunderstanding this in my opinion,\n\n1297\n01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:18.840\nis if you look at that Nmap command line,\n\n1298\n01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:24.120\nwhat you're seeing is you're\nseeing is n map, and then space-s.\n\n1299\n01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:25.910\nAnd then a letter after that s.\n\n1300\n01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:28.560\nS is scan type.\n\n1301\n01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.430\nOkay?\nSo we have s.\n\n1302\n01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:33.460\nT is a TCP scan.\n\n1303\n01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:35.645\nSo a full open scan.\n\n1304\n01:08:35.645 --> 01:08:38.680\n-s, which is the next one I'll use.\n\n1305\n01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.830\n-s is a syn scan.\n\n1306\n01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:43.775\nIt's doing a half open connection.\n\n1307\n01:08:43.775 --> 01:08:45.475\nThese are the ones that tend to be,\n\n1308\n01:08:45.475 --> 01:08:49.925\nthat the letters doesn't quite\ncorrespond to and make it as easy.\n\n1309\n01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:50.455\n>> Right.\n\n1310\n01:08:50.455 --> 01:08:54.175\n>> But if you go to the other ones,\nyou go to like a null scan, an Xmas scan,\n\n1311\n01:08:54.175 --> 01:08:54.860\nstuff like that.\n\n1312\n01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:57.292\nXmas scan for example is -sx.\n\n1313\n01:08:57.292 --> 01:08:58.895\n>> Right.\nThat makes sense.\n\n1314\n01:08:58.895 --> 01:09:00.602\n>> They're handing it to\nyou on a silver platter.\n\n1315\n01:09:00.602 --> 01:09:03.462\nI mean they can't really\nmake it that much easier.\n\n1316\n01:09:03.462 --> 01:09:09.242\nSo I'm going to let this run against\nMike's machine here, and let's talk about\n\n1317\n01:09:09.242 --> 01:09:13.582\nwhat's going on behind the scenes while\nthis is waiting for results to pop up.\n\n1318\n01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:14.880\n>> Okay.\n\n1319\n01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.300\nWhat a half open scan is,\n\n1320\n01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:20.220\nis if we already have that three-way\nhandshake, what’s happening is.\n\n1321\n01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:23.190\nOr we got the three\nhandshake that we did for\n\n1322\n01:09:23.190 --> 01:09:25.210\nfull open scan, what we’re seeing here.\n\n1323\n01:09:25.210 --> 01:09:28.000\nAnd you can see the results\ncame back much faster, right?\n\n1324\n01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.270\nJust boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.\n\n1325\n01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:32.130\nWhat’s happening here is that this scan\n\n1326\n01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:37.200\nworks by firing initial send out and\na syn ACK comes back.\n\n1327\n01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:43.470\nBut I never respond as that\ncomputer a in my earlier example,\n\n1328\n01:09:43.470 --> 01:09:46.410\nI never respond back to that syn ACK.\n\n1329\n01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:49.850\nI just chop it right there or\nI fire a reset back and kill it.\n\n1330\n01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:54.450\n>> So that final acknowledgement packet\nthat would normally come back on a three\n\n1331\n01:09:54.450 --> 01:09:56.355\nway handshake you're leaving it off.\n\n1332\n01:09:56.355 --> 01:10:01.230\nYou're never responding to it or you're\nsending back a packet with a reset flag\n\n1333\n01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:06.415\nraised, which is basically saying I'm not\nacknowledging that last send request.\n\n1334\n01:10:06.415 --> 01:10:06.937\n>> Yeah.\n\n1335\n01:10:06.937 --> 01:10:09.416\nIf you wanna look at in\nterms of phone calls,\n\n1336\n01:10:09.416 --> 01:10:12.581\nit's kind of like calling someone and\nthey go, hello.\n\n1337\n01:10:12.581 --> 01:10:15.410\nAnd you're like, oh, sorry,\nI got the wrong number and hanging up.\n\n1338\n01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:18.290\nIt's kind of like that, that you didn't\ntell them who you were or anything,\n\n1339\n01:10:18.290 --> 01:10:20.350\njust I got the wrong number.\n\n1340\n01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.340\nThat's what's happening here.\n\n1341\n01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:25.779\nSo, what happens is,\nlike I said, do a syn.\n\n1342\n01:10:25.779 --> 01:10:27.920\nA syn ACK comes back.\n\n1343\n01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.720\nAnd I don't do that final act to it.\n\n1344\n01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.870\nThat's what going to\nhappen with an open port.\n\n1345\n01:10:33.870 --> 01:10:34.630\nWe do a syn.\n\n1346\n01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:36.726\nWe do a syn ACK.\n\n1347\n01:10:36.726 --> 01:10:39.480\nNow, what happens if\nthere is a closed port?\n\n1348\n01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:43.290\nKind of already know the answer to this.\n\n1349\n01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:47.920\nIf you're playing along,\nyou know what the answer is for this one.\n\n1350\n01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.210\nIf I fire a sin to a closed port,\nMike, what would you expect to see?\n\n1351\n01:10:52.210 --> 01:10:54.270\n>> We should see a reset packet come back.\n\n1352\n01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:56.310\n>> Exactly, because it's closed.\n\n1353\n01:10:56.310 --> 01:10:57.405\nClosed is closed.\n\n1354\n01:10:57.405 --> 01:10:58.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> And at this point,\n\n1355\n01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:02.140\nit doesn't know that you're not\nplanning on responding with ta final\n\n1356\n01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:02.810\nacknowledgement, right?\n\n1357\n01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:04.620\nSo it's just doing the normal thing.\n\n1358\n01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:05.989\nYou sent a syn request,\n\n1359\n01:11:05.989 --> 01:11:10.039\nit's going to either respond with\na syn ACK or a reset packet, right?\n\n1360\n01:11:10.039 --> 01:11:11.776\n>> Yeah, for all intents and purposes,\n\n1361\n01:11:11.776 --> 01:11:15.160\nit doesn't even care whether\nyou're gonna respond to it or not.\n\n1362\n01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:18.360\nYou're trying to go to a port that closed.\n\n1363\n01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.230\nLike I said, closed is closed.\n\n1364\n01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:23.900\nYou do a syn,\nI don't care what your attempting.\n\n1365\n01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.770\nI'm not open for business, go away.\n\n1366\n01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:29.900\nIt's kind of like hey,\nyou dial the right number or\n\n1367\n01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:32.540\nthe wrong number, it doesn't matter.\n\n1368\n01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.070\nIf the phone's busy,\nyou're gonna get a busy signal.\n\n1369\n01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.810\n>> Yep.\n\n1370\n01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:36.875\n>> That's the end of it.\n\n1371\n01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:39.313\nYou know what I found out recently?\n\n1372\n01:11:39.313 --> 01:11:40.742\nThat something that people don't,\n\n1373\n01:11:40.742 --> 01:11:43.340\nthe new generation of kids coming\nout of schools doesn't know?\n\n1374\n01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:44.910\n>> What?\n>> They don't know what a busy signal is.\n\n1375\n01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:46.655\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just saw, I had to think about that.\n\n1376\n01:11:46.655 --> 01:11:50.712\nI had a friend that says that her kid\ngoes, he goes mom, my phone's broken.\n\n1377\n01:11:50.712 --> 01:11:52.462\nShe was like, it's a busy signal.\n\n1378\n01:11:52.462 --> 01:11:54.088\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\n1379\n01:11:54.088 --> 01:11:56.750\n>> [LAUGH] That's funny.\n\n1380\n01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:59.600\n>> A little piece of trivia for you guys.\n\n1381\n01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.653\nAnd anyway so\nthat's what a half open scan is.\n\n1382\n01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:07.401\nA half open scan Does only part of that.\n\n1383\n01:12:07.401 --> 01:12:11.145\nBut, the closed response\nis still the same.\n\n1384\n01:12:11.145 --> 01:12:12.070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1385\n01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:13.950\n>> Now-\n>> So, we saw it was a lot faster.\n\n1386\n01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:15.466\nRight?\n>> Oh definitely a lot faster.\n\n1387\n01:12:15.466 --> 01:12:18.451\n>> The results came back\nin less than half the time.\n\n1388\n01:12:18.451 --> 01:12:19.062\nWhy is that?\n\n1389\n01:12:19.062 --> 01:12:20.104\n>> It's not doing.\n\n1390\n01:12:20.104 --> 01:12:20.970\nThere's not as much happening.\n\n1391\n01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:24.080\nIt's very quick,\nthere's not that much happening.\n\n1392\n01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.020\nI send something out,\nit comes up and comes back.\n\n1393\n01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.010\nI don't have to do those\nextra acknowledgements.\n\n1394\n01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.290\nIt's chopped off right there.\n\n1395\n01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:33.280\nIt just moves right on down the line,\nand sweeps it and we're done.\n\n1396\n01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:36.354\nIf you look between, and\nI left the results up here on screen.\n\n1397\n01:12:36.354 --> 01:12:38.645\nIf you look at the results for\n\n1398\n01:12:38.645 --> 01:12:43.690\nthe full open and the half open scan,\nthey're the same.\n\n1399\n01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:48.240\nThere's no change between\nthe two except for speed.\n\n1400\n01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.221\nAnd if you look,\n\n1401\n01:12:49.221 --> 01:12:53.228\nend map has actually provided some\nadditional information there.\n\n1402\n01:12:53.228 --> 01:12:58.547\nIf you really want validation,\nif we see the bottom of the first one,\n\n1403\n01:12:58.547 --> 01:13:06.140\nwe can see it scanned it in 70.95 seconds,\nso 71 seconds, we'll just say that.\n\n1404\n01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:10.610\nIf we look at the bottom one,\n12.87 seconds, so 13 seconds.\n\n1405\n01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.770\n>> Wow, so we dropped off a full minute\nalmost off of our scan time there.\n\n1406\n01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:14.340\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1407\n01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.650\nIt was a lot faster.\n\n1408\n01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:20.520\nLess overhead, much better and stealthier.\n\n1409\n01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.790\n>> That was my next question there.\n\n1410\n01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:26.490\nSo why would I pick the stealth scan or\nthe half open scan,\n\n1411\n01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:30.780\nversus the full open scan?\n\n1412\n01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.850\n>> It depends how much of a warm\nfuzzy feeling you wanna get,\n\n1413\n01:13:33.850 --> 01:13:35.630\nI guess is a simple way to put it.\n\n1414\n01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:39.890\nA full open scan, even though\nthe results are the same in this case,\n\n1415\n01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:41.920\nyour system is right here.\n\n1416\n01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.050\nIt's not going that far to do it.\n\n1417\n01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:46.390\nWe're all on the same network here.\n\n1418\n01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:51.330\nIf you're scanning something remotely,\ndoing a full\n\n1419\n01:13:51.330 --> 01:13:56.720\nopen versus a half open, there could be\ndifference in results between the two.\n\n1420\n01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:59.310\n>> It's entirely possible,\nthere could be stuff in the way.\n\n1421\n01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:03.750\nPresumably, between us there's no\nfirewall in the way, messing with that.\n\n1422\n01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:06.550\n>> So, or anything else messing with that.\n\n1423\n01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:11.330\nA full open scan on a network that may\nhave filtering stuff like that done on it,\n\n1424\n01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:13.320\ncould give you some\nslightly different results.\n\n1425\n01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:16.520\nOr a half open will give you slightly\ndifferent results because we're not\n\n1426\n01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:18.840\ngetting that full confirmation.\n\n1427\n01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.270\nA full open scan is going to\ndo the three-way handshake.\n\n1428\n01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:26.260\nIf the three-way handshake doesn't\ncomplete, it's just gonna fail.\n\n1429\n01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.260\nIt will just fail.\n\n1430\n01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:30.010\nHalf open, it only does part of it.\n\n1431\n01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:31.790\nSo, there's less chance of it failing.\n\n1432\n01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:35.940\nBut, it still could give\nyou a bogus result.\n\n1433\n01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:37.760\nIt's just a question.\n\n1434\n01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.500\nWhat I tend to look at, and we're\ngonna see some others scans later on.\n\n1435\n01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:46.280\nThe different types of scans,\nevery one has its place.\n\n1436\n01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:49.440\nI like to start with scans that\nare a lot more conservative.\n\n1437\n01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:53.780\nIf I was gonna choose the half open,\nthe full open that I have,\n\n1438\n01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:58.910\nI'm probably gonna do the half open first\nalmost all of the time, as my first thing.\n\n1439\n01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:01.230\nAnd then if I don't get\nthe results I want,\n\n1440\n01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:06.290\nI might limit the ports I scan with\nthe full open to really target ones.\n\n1441\n01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:08.430\nI'm looking for this range or this range.\n\n1442\n01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:10.580\nI'm probably not gonna scan them all.\n\n1443\n01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:15.230\nOr if I do wanna scan them all,\nstill have started with that half open.\n\n1444\n01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:18.080\nAnd if I don't get the results I want,\nthen do a full open.\n\n1445\n01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.355\nBut, I'll still try to\nlimit how often I do that.\n\n1446\n01:15:20.355 --> 01:15:25.396\n>> Yeah, so that half open or\nthat stealth scan name gives it away.\n\n1447\n01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:28.639\nIt's quicker cuz I'm not doing as many\npackets that are being transmitted\n\n1448\n01:15:28.639 --> 01:15:31.140\nback and forth, and\nit's a little less noisy.\n\n1449\n01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:34.812\nYou're not creating that final pack.\n\n1450\n01:15:34.812 --> 01:15:36.912\nYou're not sending back that\nfinal acknowledgement and\n\n1451\n01:15:36.912 --> 01:15:38.860\nestablishing that three way handshake.\n\n1452\n01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:43.300\nSo you're less likely maybe to\nshow up on some log files and\n\n1453\n01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:48.179\nthings like that, so it's a little bit\nstealthier and a little bit faster.\n\n1454\n01:15:48.179 --> 01:15:49.271\nNice.\nAll right, well, I'll tell you what.\n\n1455\n01:15:49.271 --> 01:15:53.499\nLooking at the time, ladies and\ngentlemen, it is about time for\n\n1456\n01:15:53.499 --> 01:15:55.312\nus to wrap this episode up.\n\n1457\n01:15:55.312 --> 01:15:57.285\nSo we're gonna stop here.\n\n1458\n01:15:59.135 --> 01:16:01.475\nIn this episode,\nwe covered a lot of information.\n\n1459\n01:16:01.475 --> 01:16:03.925\nWe started our scanning chapter.\n\n1460\n01:16:03.925 --> 01:16:09.452\nWe took a look at the role that\nscanning plays in our hacking process.\n\n1461\n01:16:09.452 --> 01:16:13.572\nHow we take that input from what we\ngathered in that footprinting phase, and\n\n1462\n01:16:13.572 --> 01:16:15.682\nwe use that as the input.\n\n1463\n01:16:15.682 --> 01:16:19.092\nThe output from our footprinting becomes\nthe input from our scanning phase.\n\n1464\n01:16:19.092 --> 01:16:20.712\nWe talked about the role scanning plays.\n\n1465\n01:16:20.712 --> 01:16:25.882\nWe took a look at some of the different\ntypes of scans or categories of scans.\n\n1466\n01:16:25.882 --> 01:16:30.402\nAnd then, we started breaking down\nthe types of scans that we can do.\n\n1467\n01:16:30.402 --> 01:16:33.490\nEven broke out one of our tools and\nstarted showing you a couple scans.\n\n1468\n01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:34.300\nBut, there's more.\n\n1469\n01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:39.200\nWe've got more to go over when talk about\nscanning, so make sure you tune in for\n\n1470\n01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.750\nthe next episode to get the rest\nof this scanning phase.\n\n1471\n01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:46.050\nAnything else we want to add to\nthe scanning before we call it?\n\n1472\n01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:53.010\n>> At this point, I'm not gonna say\nanything additional to be added into it.\n\n1473\n01:16:53.010 --> 01:16:56.400\nBut, you might want to if you want\nto play along or anything for\n\n1474\n01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.960\nduring the next episode and do scans.\n\n1475\n01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:00.680\nYou might want to get N-Map if\nyou don't already have it, so\n\n1476\n01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:03.135\nyou can try some of these things out.\n\n1477\n01:17:03.135 --> 01:17:06.510\nCuz you are gonna need to get some\nhands-on in the trenches work with these.\n\n1478\n01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:07.940\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1479\n01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:10.820\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,

another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,470\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,080\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,580\n>> I'm doing great today.\n\n7\n00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,990\n>> All right, you got the red shirt on,\nyou're feeling brave.\n\n8\n00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,300\nYou're gonna make it through the day?\n\n9\n00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,073\n>> Yeah, I hope so.\n\n10\n00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:48,824\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If not,\n\n11\n00:00:48,824 --> 00:00:50,415\nI hope you guys bought the book.\n\n12\n00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:53,422\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And remember me, all right?\n\n13\n00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:56,190\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It could make those books you\n\n14\n00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,555\nguys are awaiting very valuable.\n\n15\n00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,234\n>> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n16\n00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:04,350\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so today we are\ncontinuing on with our scanning chapter,\n\n17\n00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,320\nso we're doing our scanning part two.\n\n18\n00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,130\nIf you missed that first episode\nwhere we started with the scanning\n\n19\n00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,690\nmake sure you back and watch that because\nwe do talk about the basics of scanning.\n\n20\n00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,560\nAnd the kind of things we're looking at,\nand what we're using because today,\n\n21\n00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,010\nwe're gonna jump right back into some\nof the different types of scans.\n\n22\n00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,560\nSo make sure you go back and\nwatch that previous episode but\n\n23\n00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,650\nwe left off yesterday firing up EnMAP and\nwe were looking at.\n\n24\n00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,640\nWe did the full open scan,\nwe did that stealth scan or\n\n25\n00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,710\nthat half scan talking about\nthat three way handshake.\n\n26\n00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:36,610\nAnd then how we can do that\nhalf open connection where\n\n27\n00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:41,140\nwe leave off that last acknowledgement and\ntry to be a little more stealthy.\n\n28\n00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,130\nI've got faster results but\nin the end the same result, so\n\n29\n00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,330\ncouple different scan then there's more,\nall right?\n\n30\n00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,720\nWe're not limited to just those two, so\n\n31\n00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,400\nwhat are some other types of scans we\nmight wanna be familiar with for our exam.\n\n32\n00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,650\n>> There's a bunch of different scans and\neach one has its place,\n\n33\n00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:04,520\nwe saw two of the ones yesterday,\nset the full open and the half open.\n\n34\n00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,170\nThe next one is called an Xmas scan and\nit's an interesting one.\n\n35\n00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,360\nIt makes sense when you see it and where\nthe name comes from, you'll see that too.\n\n36\n00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,590\n>> You're only allowed to run\nthis in the month of December.\n\n37\n00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,595\n>> Yeah, yeah,\nthat's why they call it that.\n\n38\n00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:24,030\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n39\n00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,635\n>> So what an Xmas scan is, its sending\n\n40\n00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:34,690\na packet out with\nmultiple flags set on it.\n\n41\n00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,050\nNow that doesn't seem in and\n\n42\n00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,150\nof itself to be unusual because\nwe already did that, right?\n\n43\n00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,620\nThe first two scans we talked about\nyesterday were the second connection and\n\n44\n00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,420\nit was a syn-ax so we had multiple flags\nopen or turned on in those things.\n\n45\n00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,390\nBut what makes an Xmas scan\ninteresting is it has,\n\n46\n00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,250\nanywhere from three to four or\nmaybe even more flags set.\n\n47\n00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,200\nBut it has them set in\nan illogical manner,\n\n48\n00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,120\none of the things I talked about\nyesterday was when I talked about flags.\n\n49\n00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,340\nAnd if you remember, we had ack,\nurgh, push, reset, fin and\n\n50\n00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,485\nsin, we had all of those.\n\n51\n00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:21,250\nBut, so you look at those, each one had\nits own specific purpose but what happens\n\n52\n00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:27,530\nif you sat, for example a sin, a fin,\nan urgh and a push all in the same one?\n\n53\n00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,430\nThat doesn't really kinda make sense, it's\nlegal to do that cause there's nothing in\n\n54\n00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,500\nthe spec that says you can't do that.\n\n55\n00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,360\nBut, so it's totally legal, but\n\n56\n00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,350\nthe system would get that and\nsay, what the heck is going on?\n\n57\n00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,810\n>> It has no idea how to process\nit cause you're telling it,\n\n58\n00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,440\nhey I wanna start a connection,\nhere's my sin request.\n\n59\n00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,220\nAnd at the same time you're\nsaying maybe something like,\n\n60\n00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,060\nhere's the end of the connection,\nhere's my fin request.\n\n61\n00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,440\nSo I got the fin flag turned on,\n\n62\n00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,660\nI got the sin flag turned on,\nI got the reset flag turned on.\n\n63\n00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,440\nSo the computer, the system, typically has\nno idea what, there's no way to process i.\n\n64\n00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,410\nIt doesn't know what to do with, so\n\n65\n00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,830\nthe Xmas thing it's lit up\nlike a Christmas tree, right?\n\n66\n00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,290\n>> Yeah, that's exactly where it comes\nfrom is that you have all these packets\n\n67\n00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,474\nturned on and if you were to look at any\nsort of console or anything like that in\n\n68\n00:04:12,474 --> 00:04:16,820\nfact the rumor has it that when virtually\ncreated this the way they monitored it.\n\n69\n00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,660\nThe different packets\nwhen you analyzed them,\n\n70\n00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,665\none of the early analyzer we're using.\n\n71\n00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:22,380\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Color coded them, so\n\n72\n00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,575\nit kind of looked like\na lights on Christmas tree.\n\n73\n00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:26,194\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n74\n00:04:26,194 --> 00:04:30,047\nnot only we're all of them turned on,\nit was lit up like a Christmas tree.\n\n75\n00:04:30,047 --> 00:04:33,263\nIt looked like Christmas tree lights,\nso whether or\n\n76\n00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:35,756\nnot that's true makes for a good story.\n\n77\n00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, but\n\n78\n00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,255\nthat's was my understanding with it.\n\n79\n00:04:40,255 --> 00:04:43,935\nSo, when you look at an Xmas tree scan,\nlike I said,\n\n80\n00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:48,710\nturns on some illogical connection or\nun-logical combination of flags.\n\n81\n00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,900\nNow, the question is why\nwould you wanna do that?\n\n82\n00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,470\nWell, the reason why you'd\nwanna do that is when you\n\n83\n00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,138\nfire a packet at a system with some\nillogical combination of flag set.\n\n84\n00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:02,120\nThat system's gonna do something\nin response to that or\n\n85\n00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,650\nmay redo something in response to it.\n\n86\n00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,520\nWhen you send it at a system\nif the port is open,\n\n87\n00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,930\nwhat will happen is that mas scan\ncomes in and it hits the station.\n\n88\n00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,250\nAnd the station will, if the ports open,\nmost of the computers you run into\n\n89\n00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,250\nnowadays or hosts you run into\nnowadays will just not respond.\n\n90\n00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,620\nBecause it doesn't know what to do.\n\n91\n00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,240\nYou've got an open port, hits it, boom.\n\n92\n00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,690\nIt's like, what's going on?\n\n93\n00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,760\nIf the port is closed, however, if you\ngo back to what we were talking about\n\n94\n00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:42,170\nyesterday, I made it really simple and\nstraightforward, I said, closed is closed.\n\n95\n00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:46,240\nDoesn't matter what you send to\na closed port when you're talking TCP,\n\n96\n00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,520\nyou're gonna get that\nreset fired back at you.\n\n97\n00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,932\nClosed for\nbusiness is closed for business,\n\n98\n00:05:50,932 --> 00:05:55,710\nI don't care what you're sending at me,\nso that's what's gonna happen.\n\n99\n00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,930\nNow, the interesting thing about the Xmas\nscan is when you send an Xmas scan\n\n100\n00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,760\nout to a computer,\n\n101\n00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,820\nsome computers will respond a little\ndifferently, usually they're older ones.\n\n102\n00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,453\nAnd, it's usually you're\ntalking about things like NT4,\n\n103\n00:06:11,453 --> 00:06:15,261\nwhich you may be chuckling out there.\n\n104\n00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you may be chuckling out there, but\n\n105\n00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,380\nyes they do still exist\n,they still are out there.\n\n106\n00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,285\nI've run into them at places like\nFederal Reserve banks and stuff like that.\n\n107\n00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:32,240\nAnd it's because they can't just move\ntheir software for legacy reasons,\n\n108\n00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,680\ncan't move it off that platform yet.\n\n109\n00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,440\nSo they don't have a good alternative for\nthat, so you're kinda stuck on those.\n\n110\n00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,160\nThat's changing but\nit doesn't mean you won't run into them.\n\n111\n00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,150\n>> Right, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n112\n00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,830\nSo we can get all these\ndifferent types of scans.\n\n113\n00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,280\nThey're just giving us multiple ways to\ntry to figure out, what ports are open and\n\n114\n00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,990\nwhat ports closed.\n\n115\n00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:55,860\nAnd we're just focusing on trying to get\nthe response that we're looking for.\n\n116\n00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,830\nJust being able to interpret the responses\nthat we're getting from those.\n\n117\n00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,710\n>> Exactly.\n\n118\n00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,330\n>> Our xmas scan,\nwhat's another scan we can run out there?\n\n119\n00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,300\nAre you gonna show us the Xmas scan?\n\n120\n00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,090\n>> Yeah, actually let's take\na quick look at an xmas scan.\n\n121\n00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,030\nI did yesterday, I've still got\nmy console saved from yesterday,\n\n122\n00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,670\nso what I've got here is,\nI can see my results from yesterday but\n\n123\n00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,705\nI can see at the command line,\nI have Enmap dash S X, okay?\n\n124\n00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:30,970\nHopefully, people out\nthere looking at this and\n\n125\n00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,850\ngoing, there's a pattern\nstarting to emerge here, right?\n\n126\n00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:39,610\nCause you're gonna see it's like\nthe scan type X, X for Xmas, okay?\n\n127\n00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,740\nRemember those little things because\npeople initially look at and\n\n128\n00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,590\nthey'll say wow, that's a lot of syntax.\n\n129\n00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,950\nI gotta memorize for using it in the field\nas well as going into the exam and\n\n130\n00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,670\nit's not, yeah, you gotta memorize it but\nit's not that tough.\n\n131\n00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,520\n>> It's really not, right?\n\n132\n00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,990\nI mean, you just remember your operators\ncuz it looks a little different than a lot\n\n133\n00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,218\nof command utilities that\nI'm use to working with.\n\n134\n00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:04,136\nYou've get your operator and\nthen a Space and\n\n135\n00:08:04,136 --> 00:08:07,280\nthen your parameter that goes with that,\nand Map doesn't do it that way.\n\n136\n00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,019\nYou've got that dash S as your\noperator saying, hey, the scan, and\n\n137\n00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:14,113\nthen the X or the T or\nthe S that we talked about yesterday,\n\n138\n00:08:14,113 --> 00:08:18,355\nare telling you what type of scan to do,\nand then you got like a dash P for port.\n\n139\n00:08:18,355 --> 00:08:18,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n140\n00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,830\n>> And you can set port ranges that you're\ntrying to scan and things like that.\n\n141\n00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,000\nSo, looks complex at the beginning,\nbut if you play with it and\n\n142\n00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,910\nyou get in there and use this tool\na little bit, you'll see that it's\n\n143\n00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,830\nrelatively intuitive once you learn just\nof the, the few operators that you need.\n\n144\n00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,580\n>> Well, yeah, exactly.\n\n145\n00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,780\nSo let's I'm gonna go ahead and\nhit enter on this and run this.\n\n146\n00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,360\nAnd it may take a moment or two as we,\n\n147\n00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,360\nas I, as you can see\nyesterday the results we had.\n\n148\n00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,140\nWe have 71 seconds and 13 seconds\nrespectively for the two types of scans.\n\n149\n00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,295\nSo we can see that some scans\ntake a little more time.\n\n150\n00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:53,960\nThat, a little more time than others.\n\n151\n00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,350\nSo we're running this thing,\nrunning against, your computer here, Mike.\n\n152\n00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,610\n>> Oh my gosh.\n\n153\n00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,630\nHold on,\nlet me close all my apps here now.\n\n154\n00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,035\n>> It's smoking.\n\n155\n00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:06,541\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n156\n00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,412\nI know, you better duck.\n\n157\n00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:11,630\nYou got the red shirt on, so-\n>> Yeah, that's where I was going there.\n\n158\n00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,980\nSo,-\n>> There we go.\n\n159\n00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,510\n>> It's coming back with the results.\n\n160\n00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,740\nIt's kinda interesting.\n\n161\n00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,490\nIt's saying that, hey the things, you\nknow, open, but it's saying it found it.\n\n162\n00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,190\nIt's not reporting back anything\nthat are open or filtered.\n\n163\n00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,350\nFiltered meaning that they're closed or\nsomething.\n\n164\n00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,188\nOr there could be a firewall do,\nmanipulating something in between.\n\n165\n00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:40,210\nSo that's kinda, interesting in and\nof itself, but remember one of\n\n166\n00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,300\nthe things I was telling you is that, just\na moment ago, systems may not respond.\n\n167\n00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,510\nThey don't know what to do with this.\n\n168\n00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,380\nThey just don't know how to handle it.\n\n169\n00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,860\nSome stations may respond.\n\n170\n00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,260\nYou've got, your machine's what?\n\n171\n00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,570\n>> This is a 8.1, Windows 8.1.\n\n172\n00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,060\n>> Okay, so you've got the same as me.\n\n173\n00:09:59,060 --> 00:09:59,560\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n174\n00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,520\n>> So,\nwe would expect this kind of response.\n\n175\n00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,580\nSome stations might actually\nkinda send something back.\n\n176\n00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,780\n>> Different platforms too might change\nthe way they respond to those as well.\n\n177\n00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,300\n>> Yes\n>> As far as like Linux versus Unix and\n\n178\n00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,870\nthings like that.\n\n179\n00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:22,210\n>> It's also worth, mentioning that\ndefinitely worth mentioning this is\n\n180\n00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,580\nsomething for your own know,\nfor your own knowledge.\n\n181\n00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,440\nThis is not something that EC council or\nCEH is gonna test on.\n\n182\n00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:36,950\nBut you should have kinda filed away,\nis that stuff like Windows 8.1 as well.\n\n183\n00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,340\nWe're both running that.\n\n184\n00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,695\nThey cause some very funny results too.\n\n185\n00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:41,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And you,\n\n186\n00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,570\nwe're starting to see these types of\nthings because the network stack in\n\n187\n00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,375\nWindows actually changed\nfrom what it was in XP.\n\n188\n00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:48,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n189\n00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,000\n>> Vista was a new one,\nit was re-architected from the ground up.\n\n190\n00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,320\nAnd you see,\nyou can see some different responses.\n\n191\n00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,630\nSo, you might want to,\nthis is another really good case of\n\n192\n00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,960\nwhere you want to maybe try this\nstuff out in your own lab or\n\n193\n00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,410\nsomething to get used to\nwhat the responses are.\n\n194\n00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,420\nThis response is pretty much,\nwhat I would expect, but, get used to what\n\n195\n00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,980\nthe different responses are so,\nyou can recognize them when you see them.\n\n196\n00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,850\n>> Right, yeah, in your sandbox and\nin the labs we've set up we're going to\n\n197\n00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,190\nhave multiple operating systems up there,\nso that you can compare the results, so\n\n198\n00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,890\nyou can see what it does\nwhen you hit a Windows 8.1.\n\n199\n00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,590\nVersus a Windows XP, versus a,\nLinux system and things like that,\n\n200\n00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,400\nbecause they are going to be different and\nthat's kind of what we need to know.\n\n201\n00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:32,995\n>> Yeah.\n\n202\n00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:36,470\nAbsolutely, having that knowledge\nis gonna go a long way.\n\n203\n00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,190\nI mean, you could, you literally when you\nget comfortable enough with this, you\n\n204\n00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:44,630\ncould run an XMAS scan against the system,\nor many of these scans against the system.\n\n205\n00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,960\nAnd without end map or\nanything else telling you, say,\n\n206\n00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,100\nwell, I'm almost sure that,\nthat is this operating system.\n\n207\n00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,727\n>> Right.\n\n208\n00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:53,660\nYeah.\n\n209\n00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,050\n>> Also, remember something else to\nthink as we go through these scans,\n\n210\n00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,840\nthey do get a little less reliable.\n\n211\n00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,140\nRemember, the most reliable one with\nthe most accurate results is that\n\n212\n00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,250\nfull open scan because we're\nconfirming everything.\n\n213\n00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,850\nBut it's very loud,\nas you went to the half open scan,\n\n214\n00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:14,040\nthe results we saw yesterday were\nconsistent between the full open and\n\n215\n00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,345\nthe half open,\nwhich is kinda sorta what we'd expect.\n\n216\n00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:21,565\nSometimes it might change,\nfrom what a full open scan would do.\n\n217\n00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,795\nBut I would expect them\nto be rather consistent.\n\n218\n00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:27,625\nBut what you start going to these other\nscans that do more exonic things in\n\n219\n00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:33,500\ncombinations, you may get some\ninteresting things happening.\n\n220\n00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,210\n>> Yeah, cuz when we're doing that full\nopen scan we're kinda following the rules\n\n221\n00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,200\nof TCP/IP right?\n\n222\n00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,950\nWe're doing it the proper way,\nthe operating system knows\n\n223\n00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,180\nexactly how it's supposed to respond\nto that, if it's open or closed.\n\n224\n00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,390\nA half open really the same thing,\nwe're just not finishing it.\n\n225\n00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,120\nBut the first part of\nis a normal connection.\n\n226\n00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,010\nWhen we start getting into some of these\nother ones now we're kinda tricking\n\n227\n00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,750\nit a little bit, or,\nthrowing it a curveball.\n\n228\n00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,980\nAnd we're doing that on purpose\nto see how it responds, but\n\n229\n00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,669\nthe responses might not be consistent.\n\n230\n00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,340\n>> Exactly, and\nlet me also kind of mention.\n\n231\n00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,120\nI haven't done this yet,\nyou'll sometimes see this in books,\n\n232\n00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,230\nand other kinds of documentation.\n\n233\n00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,790\nYou can put this dash-v in, as well.\n\n234\n00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,640\nThat stands for verbose, and what that\nwill do if you hit it, sometimes it will\n\n235\n00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,510\ngive you a little more information\nwhich I am, actually seeing here.\n\n236\n00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,830\nYou'll notice it's a little more chatty,\nso that's something that you could also,\n\n237\n00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:31,240\nyou can run with any of these scans.\n\n238\n00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,870\nYou can run that dash-V,\n\n239\n00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,560\nto see if it's going to give you anymore\ninformation that might be helpful to you.\n\n240\n00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,780\nMaybe you're looking at this and saying.\n\n241\n00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,960\nI'm not really a 100% comfortable\nwith what that gave when I did,\n\n242\n00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,160\nwhen I ran that.\n\n243\n00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,580\nSo now you can look at this and say okay,\nwell, it gave me a little bit more.\n\n244\n00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,915\nThis one, you know what we're getting.\n\n245\n00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,255\nBeing here it is saying,\n\n246\n00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:57,605\nit's either saying it scanned the same as\nit did before says scanned 1,000 ports.\n\n247\n00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:00,125\nBut it's telling you when\nit was running the scans,\n\n248\n00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:02,915\ntelling you about information\nit sent back and forth.\n\n249\n00:14:02,915 --> 00:14:06,170\nSo we are getting more information.\n\n250\n00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,890\nI was comfortable with what we saw before\nbut, this might be something I run in some\n\n251\n00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,820\ncases just to kinda get,\nmore of that warm, fuzzy feeling.\n\n252\n00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,280\nIt's like, did it actually complete\nthe way I expected and what's going on?\n\n253\n00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,510\n>> Absolutely, yeah, cuz we're gonna,\n\n254\n00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,230\nthe results are gonna change with our\ninformation about the scan we ran.\n\n255\n00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:25,108\nIt's showing up now so\nwe're confirming that it did finish.\n\n256\n00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:28,856\nWe don't know, maybe it did glitch out or\nmaybe something happened in the first run.\n\n257\n00:14:28,856 --> 00:14:34,660\nHere we're verifying I can see it did run\nand I'm just not getting any results.\n\n258\n00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:40,219\nAll right so we got the full open scan,\nwe got that half open or\n\n259\n00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:46,300\nthat still scan with that with that\ndash-S or T from my full scan.\n\n260\n00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And that's a capital T right in this\n\n261\n00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,250\nparticular case.\n\n262\n00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,810\nA lot of command prompt\nutilities aren't case sensitive.\n\n263\n00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,750\nAnd map is gonna be.\n\n264\n00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,400\nSo it was a capital t for a full open.\n\n265\n00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,360\nWe had that capital S, so\na dash-S capital S for that stealth scan.\n\n266\n00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:06,410\nWe just Sean run the Xmas scan,\nwhich is dash-S X and it's a capital x.\n\n267\n00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,410\nWhat's another one we can do?\n\n268\n00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,410\nWell, look at what we just did,\nwe ran Xmas scan, right?\n\n269\n00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,065\nWe had all the flags turned on.\n\n270\n00:15:15,065 --> 00:15:16,480\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Well you\n\n271\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,190\nkinda can see where this is\ngoing if all the flags are on.\n\n272\n00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,080\n>> You can turn all the flags off, right?\n\n273\n00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,160\n>> Turn them off.\n\n274\n00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,220\n>> See what that does.\n\n275\n00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,590\n>> We call that the black out scan?\n\n276\n00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,790\n>> Yeah the black out scan.\n\n277\n00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,685\n>> The Grinch that stole christmas scan.\n\n278\n00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:34,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we call this one, what, a null scan?\n\n279\n00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,590\n>> A null scan, exactly.\n\n280\n00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,879\n>> Null meaning no flags.\n\n281\n00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:40,580\n>> Yeah exactly,\nit will remove all the flags.\n\n282\n00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,780\nSo, what we're going to do\nin here is a simple change,\n\n283\n00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,010\nI mean, you probably saw this coming,\nwhen I told you before,\n\n284\n00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,460\nit was, Xmas scan dash x x.\n\n285\n00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,340\nRuined that little spiel about\nyou should see a pattern here.\n\n286\n00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,530\nThere's a, dash,\nthere's a dash sn for a null.\n\n287\n00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,535\nNow, I'm gonna leave\nthe dash-V in here on this\n\n288\n00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:03,074\none\n>> Okay.\n\n289\n00:16:03,074 --> 00:16:05,834\n>> Just be God to make it interesting.\n\n290\n00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:08,977\nYou know, so I'm going to run this and\nwe're going to see what the results are.\n\n291\n00:16:08,977 --> 00:16:13,958\nNow, and so you can see it's running and\nit's scanning those 1000 ports,\n\n292\n00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,855\nas part, as part of its scan.\n\n293\n00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:20,216\nAnd while it's doing this,\nyou want to kind of elaborate on\n\n294\n00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:25,301\nsomething you were saying Mike,\nabout these being case sensitive.\n\n295\n00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:29,670\nYeah, that's very much\na good thing to file away.\n\n296\n00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,920\nDon't get lazy and\nstart putting some of these commands in,\n\n297\n00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,860\nwithout case on them, because some\ncommands on the Windows platform\n\n298\n00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,060\nwill accept that in the sake\nof the security tools.\n\n299\n00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,370\nI know on Windows were very much used\nto not having to worry about case.\n\n300\n00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,512\n>> For us lazy admins.\n\n301\n00:16:46,512 --> 00:16:47,641\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n302\n00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:49,104\nNothing wrong with it really.\n\n303\n00:16:49,104 --> 00:16:50,420\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n304\n00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,720\nwe've gotten used to not putting case in,\nand\n\n305\n00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,720\nthen we're going to do a tool like this\nthat can actually be sensitive to case.\n\n306\n00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,390\nRemember if you're a Windows user and\n\n307\n00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,970\nyou're moving over to Linux platform,\nlike we've\n\n308\n00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,300\nbeen talking about the last few days that\nyou're gonna have to get used to that.\n\n309\n00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,100\nLinux platform is case sensitive.\n\n310\n00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,570\nSo you might as well, if you're\ngonna be doing pen testing, either,\n\n311\n00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,570\nyou know, make sure that you've got good\nsituational awareness,, and you don't\n\n312\n00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,280\njust blindly type something in, which\nis kinda funny to say but it happens.\n\n313\n00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,150\nYou switch over and you know,\njust type something in like, oh that's,\n\n314\n00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,510\nwhy isn't that working?\n\n315\n00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,795\nWell, case isn't right.\n\n316\n00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:33,610\nJust get used to putting\nthe proper case in, and\n\n317\n00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,640\nthat works the same on both platforms,\nbut you do have to remember that case.\n\n318\n00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,550\n>> Yep, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n319\n00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,730\nSo, it's a good habit to get into.\n\n320\n00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,820\n>> It really is.\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n321\n00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,490\nDrives me crazy.\n\n322\n00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,620\nYou guys have seen me type\non previous episodes.\n\n323\n00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,475\nI'm not the best typer, but\npractice makes perfect, right?\n\n324\n00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:50,340\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n\n325\n00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,300\n>> I don't think we have\nany episodes on typing.\n\n326\n00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,335\nMaybe we can get some requests for that.\n\n327\n00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:56,478\n>> [LAUGH] I won't be teaching that.\n\n328\n00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:57,940\n>> Is Mavis Beacon still available?\n\n329\n00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,495\n>> I don't think it is.\n\n330\n00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:02,782\nI used to tell people I dated Mavis and\nI still can't type.\n\n331\n00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:08,755\n[LAUGH]\n>> So let's see.\n\n332\n00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,979\nSo we talked about an Xmas scan,\nwhere we turn all the flags on,\n\n333\n00:18:12,979 --> 00:18:14,512\nthat's that dash sx.\n\n334\n00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:18,378\nWe've talked, we're groaning now in\nthe background at the mole scan.\n\n335\n00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:19,330\n>> Which actually got us results.\n\n336\n00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,090\n>> And then where we said no flags.\n\n337\n00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,900\nAnd so let's see what the,\nwhat the results looked like for that.\n\n338\n00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,130\n>> Yeah, let's take a look at our results,\ncuz it has completed.\n\n339\n00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,180\nWe look at results.\n\n340\n00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:33,040\nAnd results kinda look the same\nas what we had for an Xmas scan.\n\n341\n00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,950\n>> Sweet, I'm safe, you can't see me.\n\n342\n00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> I'm stealth.\n\n343\n00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,687\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I am a ninja.\n\n344\n00:18:37,687 --> 00:18:41,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n345\n00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,880\nit's giving us the same\nthing in this case.\n\n346\n00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,750\nThat's fine for here.\n\n347\n00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,986\nYou can see what the scan, looks like,\nthe results are consistent,\n\n348\n00:18:52,986 --> 00:18:55,702\nwhat I expect to see from an 8.1 machine.\n\n349\n00:18:55,702 --> 00:19:00,563\nSo do get used to what these\ndifferent types look like.\n\n350\n00:19:00,563 --> 00:19:04,173\nIf you're setting up your own lab at home,\nyou know try it against, if you\n\n351\n00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:08,940\nhave different virtual machines, if you\nhave different machines available to you.\n\n352\n00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,160\nRun some scans and\nsee what happens with it.\n\n353\n00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,570\nSo this is a case where you can see, okay,\n\n354\n00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,660\nWindows 8.1 it's doing\nwhat I would expect.\n\n355\n00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,450\nIt's not responding at all.\n\n356\n00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,080\nThe thing in here is that it's telling\nyou realistically, when you look at this,\n\n357\n00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,270\nit saying it scanned all 1000 ports.\n\n358\n00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,540\nAnd, it's not giving me any information\nback, so, are they open or are closed?\n\n359\n00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,850\nYou know we don't really have you know, we\ncan't really say with 100% acc, you know,\n\n360\n00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,970\naccuracy that they're,\nthey're opened or closed.\n\n361\n00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,514\nBut, we have accomplished at least one\nthing, we know that there's actually\n\n362\n00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,575\na host there, it does give us that, but-\n>> Yes, we do know we've got [CROSSTALK]\n\n363\n00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:47,283\n>> You know we've done that, right?\n\n364\n00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:48,200\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n365\n00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,170\nWe did that before we started the port\nscan cuz there's no point in scanning a,\n\n366\n00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,110\ndoing a port scan if the host isn't up and\nrunning.\n\n367\n00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,700\nSo, it's confirming for us,\nthat the host is up and\n\n368\n00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,450\nwe're just not getting any responses for\nthat particular type of scan.\n\n369\n00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,130\nBut again, you know,\nrunning the multiple scans, responses or\n\n370\n00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,965\nnot, is giving us information.\n\n371\n00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:08,355\nAll right, I was going to try and\nfire up a quick little VM.\n\n372\n00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:10,480\nI'll see if I can get it\ndone in the background here.\n\n373\n00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,921\nI get a VM with some Linux going,\nif I can get in an IP address,\n\n374\n00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,975\nyou can scan that one too,\nso will see what that does.\n\n375\n00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:18,980\nAll right, so, we got our Xmas,\nwe got our knoll.\n\n376\n00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,460\nWe got another one we want to go over.\n\n377\n00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,940\n>> Oh absolutely, we've got another\ntype of scan called an ACK scan.\n\n378\n00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:31,420\nNow, before we talk about what an ACK\nscan is, as soon as they say it,\n\n379\n00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,090\nyou probably know an ACK scan is, you know\nwhat, I told you about the flags, and\n\n380\n00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,940\nyou've seen the pattern here.\n\n381\n00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,780\nIt's like an ACK scan, okay,\nmust, must have the ACK flag set.\n\n382\n00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,570\nSo, I'm firing out of pack at\na system with an ACK flag set to\n\n383\n00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,880\nsee what the response is.\n\n384\n00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,890\nWell, you know we are,\nwe know what an act flag does actually.\n\n385\n00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,460\nIt's an acknowledgment, but why would\nyou want to do that is the question?\n\n386\n00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,000\nWhy would you want to say,\nyou know, hey got it,\n\n387\n00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,740\nbasically to a system that you\nhave no prior relationship with.\n\n388\n00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,710\n>> Yeah.\n>> Cuz that's what's happening,\n\n389\n00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,980\nyou're sending an ACK out to somebody.\n\n390\n00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,356\nThat's like calling someone up and\nsaying there you go goodbye, click.\n\n391\n00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:10,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, and like what was that?\n\n392\n00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,270\nWhat happened there?\n\n393\n00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,670\n>> What the heck are you acknowledging?\n\n394\n00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,860\nI didn't say anything to you?\n\n395\n00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,473\nAnd you check and you go like what,\nwhat did I send you in the first place?\n\n396\n00:21:18,473 --> 00:21:19,934\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah just walk up to\n\n397\n00:21:19,934 --> 00:21:22,459\nsomeone random today and\ngoing, hey, got it!\n\n398\n00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,240\nWhat'd you, what's you get?\n\n399\n00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,010\nDon't say anything after that,\njust walk away and watch them freak out.\n\n400\n00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,856\nSo.\n\n401\n00:21:28,856 --> 00:21:32,258\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we have to look at is why would\n\n402\n00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,000\nyou want to do that.\n\n403\n00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,400\nThe reason why you're doing an ACK scan,\ntypically, is because you've got a state\n\n404\n00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,850\nfull firewall or you suspect that there's\na state full firewall between you and\n\n405\n00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,200\nthe target that you're trying to go after.\n\n406\n00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,210\nAnd, we're gonna elaborate a lot\nmore on state full firewalls, and\n\n407\n00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,380\nfirewalls as a topic area\nlater on in the course.\n\n408\n00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,020\nBut, we do have to talk about them now\nbecause it is something that you very well\n\n409\n00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,580\ncould encounter.\n\n410\n00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,030\nAnd, so in this case, what we're\ngonna do is we're gonna say, okay,\n\n411\n00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,990\nwe're gonna use ACK scan, detect that if\nthere's a presence of a firewall or not.\n\n412\n00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:14,140\nWhat's going to happen is if you send\nan ACK out to an ACK packet out to\n\n413\n00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:19,330\na computer that you have no relationship\nwith, if the computer is there and\n\n414\n00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:25,360\nthere's no firewall between, you're\nprobably not going to get a response back.\n\n415\n00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,850\nNow if you fire it to a computer and\nthere's a stateful firewall in place,\n\n416\n00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,925\nyou're gonna get a reset back, because\nthat firewalls gonna say no, we're done.\n\n417\n00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:43,490\nAnd it's doing that because, think\nabout it, If I send an acknowledgement\n\n418\n00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,010\na staple firewall keeps track of\nthe conversations that go across it.\n\n419\n00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,400\nSo if you send a ACK out to something and\n\n420\n00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,272\nthe stateful firewall sees it coming\nthrough or attempting to come through.\n\n421\n00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,730\nIt's gonna check to see was their\na prior relationship here, and\n\n422\n00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,930\nsince it will determine very\nquickly that there was not.\n\n423\n00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,592\nIt's gonna,\nto say that isn't gonna continue.\n\n424\n00:23:02,592 --> 00:23:03,672\nYou shall not pass.\n\n425\n00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:04,543\n>> That's right, that's right.\n\n426\n00:23:04,543 --> 00:23:07,489\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's trying to keep our system and\n\n427\n00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:08,260\nour host safe.\n\n428\n00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,830\nIt sees this coming through and,\nand that's kinda suspicious.\n\n429\n00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,730\nWhere is this acknowledgement coming from,\n\n430\n00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,630\nwhy is there no beginning of\nthe conversation, I'm just gonna reset it.\n\n431\n00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,130\nIt might be malicious activity, it could\nbe that it's just an accidental packet,\n\n432\n00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,480\nit was something wrong.\n\n433\n00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,224\nThat's what just figures is the safest\nthing to do, is just reset it.\n\n434\n00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:27,986\nAnd what would happen normally if it\nwas a legitimate connection attempt,\n\n435\n00:23:27,986 --> 00:23:31,925\nthen the sending host or the one that was\ntrying to connect would say oh let me try\n\n436\n00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:34,156\nagain, and send the initial send request.\n\n437\n00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:36,987\nSo that's really what it's doing is\nsaying oh something's wrong start this\n\n438\n00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:37,998\nconnection attempt over.\n\n439\n00:23:37,998 --> 00:23:39,135\nThat's really how it handles it.\n\n440\n00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:40,320\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n441\n00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,850\nIt's doing what it's designed to do.\n\n442\n00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,570\nSo, if you get this information or\nlack thereof,\n\n443\n00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,365\nit can very quickly tell you if\nthere's a firewall there or not.\n\n444\n00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:58,227\nSo you've acknowledged its presence so\nto speak.\n\n445\n00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:01,026\n>> You've confirmed its presence or\nlack thereof presence.\n\n446\n00:24:01,026 --> 00:24:05,415\nAnd so, you, that can help, tailor what\nyou're gonna do next, the next stage of\n\n447\n00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:09,420\nyour attack, you know, what, what actions\nyou have to do to get that right.\n\n448\n00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,090\n>> Absolutely.\n\n449\n00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,300\nAbsolutely.\n\n450\n00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,990\nSo why don't we take a look at,\nwhat, do you want to do the,\n\n451\n00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,960\ndid we do the no scan yet?\n\n452\n00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,000\nI think we did the no we\ndidn't do the ax scan.\n\n453\n00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,010\n>> We we didn't do the ax scan and\nyou know,\n\n454\n00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:23,294\nnot going to worry about scanning your\nsystem, not any in between ha ha.\n\n455\n00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:24,130\n[LAUGH] ]\n>> ha ha [LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,310\n>> You want to run some of these scans?\n\n457\n00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,260\nAgain, I do have a Linux box up now.\n\n458\n00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,330\nSo if you want to run these\nscans again maybe and\n\n459\n00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,350\nsee what there's a show him the different\nresults with looking at a Linux box?\n\n460\n00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:36,040\n>> You know, we'll try,\nwe'll try that a bit later I think.\n\n461\n00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,910\n>> Okay.\n>> That's a, that's a good thing to do.\n\n462\n00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,390\n>> Right.\n>> So but in Ac scan, you know, you pro,\n\n463\n00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,090\nyou probably know without me without\nme having to show you in here.\n\n464\n00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,400\nHere's an Ac scan coming up on,\non the screen here.\n\n465\n00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,075\nYou'll see it's dash SA.\n\n466\n00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:50,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n467\n00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,020\n>> 'Kay.\nIt's an Ac Scan.\n\n468\n00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,950\n>> Yep.\n\n469\n00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:54,130\nThis is a type of scan.\n\n470\n00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,000\n>> Yea.\nExactly.\n\n471\n00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,930\nIt's, it's, it's.\n\n472\n00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,920\nThat, that's it, excuse me, that's it.\n\n473\n00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,000\nThat's all you have to do.\n\n474\n00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,330\nSo, so we are so that's the final type\nof scan that we have to worry about.\n\n475\n00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,920\nThere is something I do wanna throw in\nhere, I think is valuable information,\n\n476\n00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,055\nbecause we just mentioned the firewalls.\n\n477\n00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What about other things, such as IDS's,\n\n478\n00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,120\nintrusion detection systems.\n\n479\n00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,050\n>> Yep.\n>> You know, if you talk about firewalls,\n\n480\n00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,655\nit's in the same zip code as IDS.\n\n481\n00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:23,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n482\n00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,170\nSpecifically network based IDS.\n\n483\n00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:30,910\nIf a network based IDS is in,\nis in place, a network based IDS is\n\n484\n00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:36,430\nmonitoring activity you know on you know,\non the network as it flows back and forth.\n\n485\n00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:40,295\nNow there, we'll get, we'll,\nwe will dig into that topic more later on.\n\n486\n00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:40,940\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n487\n00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,120\n>> But it\n>> Just as,\n\n488\n00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,460\njust know that yes if you're not aware\nof what they are, go you know quite yet\n\n489\n00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:53,700\nan IDS is, is like a smoke detector,\nit won't pick up\n\n490\n00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,580\nsomething that's not usual behavior\n>> So what if,\n\n491\n00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,860\nif these scans are all known,\nI mean these are all documented.\n\n492\n00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,030\n>> Right.\n>> You know and IDS is gonna pick that up.\n\n493\n00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,870\nIt's, it can-\n>> [CROSSTALK] It's gonna say, whoa,\n\n494\n00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,390\nwhat's going on here?\n\n495\n00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n496\n00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,080\n>> Somebody's running a scam.\n\n497\n00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,990\n>> Yeah, exactly and\nit could very well go and shut you down.\n\n498\n00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,310\nAnd say okay, or alert somebody.\n\n499\n00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,710\nEh, probably not going to shut you down,\n\n500\n00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,460\nunless it's an IP asset prevention system,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n501\n00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,360\n>> But if, if it's and IDS it will\nalert somebody, and like we said,\n\n502\n00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,780\nthat's what exactly what\nwe don't want to do.\n\n503\n00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:26,210\nSo, we have to find a way to mask the,\nthese scans.\n\n504\n00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:29,400\nAnd one of the things you can do\nis you can use what's called a,\n\n505\n00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,080\na packet craftier.\n\n506\n00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,830\nOr you could do this and end that as well.\n\n507\n00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,810\nWhat that is is you could take,\n\n508\n00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,065\nuse one of those mechanisms to\nactually fragment a packet.\n\n509\n00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,700\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Now, the way you fragment a packet is,\n\n510\n00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,710\nas you may or may not know,\nmeans we're taking the packet,\n\n511\n00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:50,460\nwe're chopping it up into pieces\n>> And those pieces, you know,\n\n512\n00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,510\nwill travel to the, to the, to their\nfinal destination and get reassembled.\n\n513\n00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,030\nYou know, now the reason why they're\nfragmented is because you have something\n\n514\n00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:04,640\non a network called an MTU Do a maxable\ntransmittable unit size and it's,\n\n515\n00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,730\nonce you go over that limit it's saying\nthat this is the largest size like of,\n\n516\n00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,610\nof information I can take that\ncan traverse this network.\n\n517\n00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,030\nIf you go over that limit it's gonna\nhave to chop it up to pieces that will,\n\n518\n00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,540\nthat themselves are under that limit so\n\n519\n00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,190\nthey can all travel that,\nyou know over the network.\n\n520\n00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:26,110\nWell, we can manipulate that by taking a,\nby using a packet craftier.\n\n521\n00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,820\nOr using, something like to fragment\nthose packets, and target it towards a,\n\n522\n00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,540\ntowards a specific host.\n\n523\n00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,130\nAnd those fragments will\ngo across the network.\n\n524\n00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,180\nWhen IDS sees those,\nas well as a firewall, in some cases.\n\n525\n00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,620\nIt will see those things.\n\n526\n00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,700\nAnd say okay,\nI'm just going to let those things pass.\n\n527\n00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,200\nAnd those things will all go\nto the final destination and\n\n528\n00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,440\nthat destination will reassemble and\nprocess them.\n\n529\n00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,810\nThe tricky thing is,\nis figuring out what, what the,\n\n530\n00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,080\nyou know MTU size is on that network.\n\n531\n00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,040\nThere's, there's a way to do it and\nwe'll talk about that at some\n\n532\n00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,600\npoint during the course but\nit's to kind of give you a peak.\n\n533\n00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,250\nAt it.\n\n534\n00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,830\nIt's using ping.\n\n535\n00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,500\nYou can actually use ping and\nset the size of a packet and\n\n536\n00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,450\nthen also tell ping not to,\nwhat not to let the packet fragment.\n\n537\n00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,100\nSo what will happen is you just\nkeep gradually increasing the size\n\n538\n00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,910\nuntil ping says I can't send that packet.\n\n539\n00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:19,870\nIt won't get to that destination anymore.\n\n540\n00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:23,110\nAnd once you know that, you've gone over\nthe limit and you can sort of play with\n\n541\n00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,490\nthe size to see exactly where that MTU\nis so just make you stay over that.\n\n542\n00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:29,220\n>> Yeah.\nYou just got to go and up and up and\n\n543\n00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,520\nup and\nup until it says it cannot do it any more.\n\n544\n00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840\nEither it might back down or\nyou find that sweet spot.\n\n545\n00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,810\nNow you know what they've set their\nMTU to and I can go from there.\n\n546\n00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:39,260\nA great way to discover that.\n\n547\n00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,040\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n548\n00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,335\nLet's see and yeah Jay has mentioned\nlike the, the default there.\n\n549\n00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:46,280\n1,500 for\nEthernet i'll think is what we've got.\n\n550\n00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,080\nJumbo frames you're up to 9,000.\n\n551\n00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,850\nBut that can be changed.\n\n552\n00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,280\nYou know the network admins might have\nadjusted that a little bit as well so.\n\n553\n00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,650\n>> And, and, and remember James\nyeah you did bring up 1,500 and\n\n554\n00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,585\nyou know Mike you're saying that's for\nEthernet that's the default.\n\n555\n00:28:58,585 --> 00:28:59,100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n556\n00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,650\nThe, the key word being default there.\n\n557\n00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,190\nSomebody could have changed that,\nlike you said.\n\n558\n00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,670\nThe other thing to remember is, there,\n\n559\n00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,740\nyou're not, you might not necessarily\nbe on the exact same network.\n\n560\n00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,560\nThere could be other intermediaries\nbetween it, so if you're if you're working\n\n561\n00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,230\nremote and trying to you know\nhit a network on the other side.\n\n562\n00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,790\nWhat about the MTU's of the networks and\nthe you know between it?\n\n563\n00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,550\n>> Right.\n>> So you can't just look at the one far,\n\n564\n00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,260\nfar away and\nsay alright well that one's 1,500.\n\n565\n00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,870\n>> If, if you cross it over a frame relay\nor an ATM portion or something like that.\n\n566\n00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,845\n>> yeah those may allow different or\nthose probably will allow different sizes.\n\n567\n00:29:31,845 --> 00:29:32,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you're gonna have to account\n\n568\n00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:33,500\nfor that.\n\n569\n00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,000\n>> Yep.\n\n570\n00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,850\nVery good, very good.\n\n571\n00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,390\nWell, tell you what.\n\n572\n00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,650\nDo we have any more scans we want to\ntake a look at before we take a break?\n\n573\n00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:43,930\n>> Not right now.\n\n574\n00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,150\nWell, I think we've covered\nall of the TCP scans,\n\n575\n00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:51,040\nin fact we have covered all of\nthe TCP scans over last episode and\n\n576\n00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,415\nthis episode those are ones that you\nreally want to get, to get familiar with.\n\n577\n00:29:55,415 --> 00:29:56,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> There are some of them\n\n578\n00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,885\nthere are a good amount of them.\n\n579\n00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:58,570\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n580\n00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,230\n>> Get used to the flags.\n\n581\n00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,900\n>> Yeah.\n>> That we have in place.\n\n582\n00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:06,650\nYou know, so these are big, big deals so\nget use get used to all of those.\n\n583\n00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:10,385\nThe next step we have come,\nwe have coming up is using UDP scanning.\n\n584\n00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:11,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n585\n00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,740\n>> cuz that's a little bit of\na different beast because we don't have\n\n586\n00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,160\nthose acknowledgements and,\nand responses coming back.\n\n587\n00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,290\nSo we have to adjust our\nstrategy just a bit.\n\n588\n00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,440\n>> All right, very good.\n\n589\n00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,645\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe're gonna We're gonna go ahead and\n\n590\n00:30:22,645 --> 00:30:23,855\ntake a quick break here.\n\n591\n00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,935\nWhen we come back, as Sean said,\nwe're gonna hit some UDP scans and\n\n592\n00:30:26,935 --> 00:30:29,415\neventually work our way into mapping and\nnetwork.\n\n593\n00:30:29,415 --> 00:30:30,385\nSo stay tuned.\n\n594\n00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:34,812\nWe'll be right back [NOISE]\n\n595\n00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:40,394\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n596\n00:30:40,394 --> 00:30:44,860\nWe are getting ready to take\na continue on with our scanning.\n\n597\n00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,430\nWe talked a lot about our, our PTC\nscanning which is a very common way to\n\n598\n00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,800\nscan our, our targets and our hosts.\n\n599\n00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,770\nBut we have other protocols\nthat we can use, right.\n\n600\n00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:57,330\nWe've got UDP,\nour user data gram protocol, so\n\n601\n00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,130\nlet's take a look at some of\nthe scanning we can do with that.\n\n602\n00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,120\n>> Yeah, we, we need to,\nwe definitely need to talk about,\n\n603\n00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,870\nyou know, both protocols, we've got\nTCP which we already flushed out.\n\n604\n00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:12,850\nAnd there are more thing you\ncan do with with TCP yet\n\n605\n00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,000\nwe're not covering here so\nI do recommend that you explore.\n\n606\n00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,610\nThe ones I showed you\nare the essential scans I gave you and\n\n607\n00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,420\ndissected those for you.\n\n608\n00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,570\nBut the other one is, is of course UDP.\n\n609\n00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,390\nThat's it's companion.\n\n610\n00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:30,660\nAgain, we know UDP is\na connectionless protocol.\n\n611\n00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,530\nSo, meaning that does not\nreturn acknowledgements.\n\n612\n00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,430\nSo, we can't really deal\nwith it in the same way.\n\n613\n00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,050\nThere's not those flags and [INAUDIBLE]\nstuff like that we have in TCP.\n\n614\n00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:45,892\nIt's just not there, so we have to find\na way to use that to our advantage.\n\n615\n00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:49,357\nOne of the things that we have when\nwe do a UDP scan, it is very quiet\n\n616\n00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:53,395\nbecause we don't have those\nacknowledgements, so that's a big benefit.\n\n617\n00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:57,471\nBut again, if we're gonna use it,\nwe gotta know how it's gonna, you know,\n\n618\n00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:01,766\nhow it's gonna be used and how the results\nlook To be able to get the right result.\n\n619\n00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:06,150\nYou'll actually find it's quite easy\nwhen you do, when you get down to it.\n\n620\n00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,960\nOkay, remember, like I said UDP\ndoes not return acknowledgements.\n\n621\n00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,520\nSo with that in mind, when you do\na UDP scans, are firing ports and\n\n622\n00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,404\nthey are open,\nthat means we get no response.\n\n623\n00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:25,290\nSo that's a dead give away, it's not open.\n\n624\n00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:29,460\nNow, if we fired out a closed port,\nthat's the question,\n\n625\n00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,710\nwhat do you expect to see\nif that port it closed?\n\n626\n00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,245\nWell, you're not gonna get a reset back,\nthat's a TCP thing.\n\n627\n00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,270\nSo, but you are gonna get something back.\n\n628\n00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:43,210\nYou're gonna get a message\nsaying host unreachable, or\n\n629\n00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:46,000\nit could say ICMP\nunreachable in some cases.\n\n630\n00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,806\nBut it will send a message back saying\nthis is unreachable, it won't it be,\n\n631\n00:32:49,806 --> 00:32:53,720\nitsounds kind of weird that it will\nsay that, because it definitely is.\n\n632\n00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,140\nAnd when you look at it\ndefinitely is hitting that host.\n\n633\n00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,110\nAnd that host is informing it that,\nhey, you can't talk to me.\n\n634\n00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,090\nBut it's gonna come back and\nsay that it's unreachable.\n\n635\n00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,805\nWhich still is correct to say that.\n\n636\n00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:10,270\nBut it may seem kinda weird\nwhen you initially see it.\n\n637\n00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:16,560\nBut remember, you only get a message back\nwhen GDP scanning if a port is closed.\n\n638\n00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,205\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n639\n00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,730\nCuz that's the way the protocol\nis designed, right?\n\n640\n00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,180\nThere is no, it's connection list,\n\n641\n00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,580\nthere is no response that's\nsupposed to come back.\n\n642\n00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,340\nSo it's doing exactly\nwhat it's supposed to do.\n\n643\n00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,370\nIf it's open, it says nothing.\n\n644\n00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,150\nIf it's closed, [COUGH] it doesn't say\nanything either, but we get that error.\n\n645\n00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,180\nSo that error comes back and\nsays, host unreachable.\n\n646\n00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,620\nAnd then that's the way it's designed.\n\n647\n00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,550\nSo, we don't have all\nthe different flags to play with,\n\n648\n00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:39,620\nand things like that\nwhen we're doing the UTP.\n\n649\n00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,640\n>> Exactly.\n\n650\n00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:48,530\nRemember, we're doing the UDP scan,\nbecause it is quieter, it's very quiet.\n\n651\n00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:51,570\nSince we don't have that there,\nwe don't have all those flags and\n\n652\n00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:54,860\nconfirmations, all the other stuff,\nhandshakes all going on.\n\n653\n00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,490\nVery, very, very quiet,\nbut you do pay for that.\n\n654\n00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,850\nIt can be slower to do it.\n\n655\n00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,749\nAnd it may be a little unreliable but,\nwhat?\n\n656\n00:34:05,749 --> 00:34:09,180\nUDPs called an unreliable protocol-\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n657\n00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,750\n>> So,\nyou should know what you're getting into.\n\n658\n00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,640\nSo it's just something to remember, but it\nis something you can put in your arsenal.\n\n659\n00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,910\nAnd you should have in your arsenal,\n\n660\n00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,130\nbecause you might have\nto switch over to it.\n\n661\n00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,812\nHeck, you might have to do a sanity check.\n\n662\n00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:27,460\nOf things that you are already doing,\nyou see.\n\n663\n00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:33,380\nWell, these TCP results are kind of I\nfeel kind of okay with them, not 100%.\n\n664\n00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,810\nLet me try to run the UDP scan, against\na specific host and see what I get?\n\n665\n00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:41,310\nAnd see if that, fills in any\nmore spots on, in the picture.\n\n666\n00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,820\n>> Yeah.\nIt kind of confirmed the results we're\n\n667\n00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,470\nalready getting,\n\n668\n00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,180\nor show us that we're maybe not\ninterpreting those TCP results correctly.\n\n669\n00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,330\nSo definitely,\nmore information is always good.\n\n670\n00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:55,880\nHaving more options as we go through\nour scanning phase, is good as well.\n\n671\n00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,320\n>> I definitely always like to have,\nwhen I do pen testing,\n\n672\n00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,194\nthis is why I was recommending knowing\nmore tools, and more techniques.\n\n673\n00:35:04,194 --> 00:35:09,060\nDon't focus on any specific one, know what\nthat is, but definitely know different\n\n674\n00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,040\nways to approach a problem, and\nbe prepared to pull those out of the bag.\n\n675\n00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,800\nJust because, in all,\nyou're gonna wanna do this to any checks.\n\n676\n00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,529\nYou're gonna wanna double check, cuz\nsometimes the results may not be the best.\n\n677\n00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,220\nI've developed over time, kind of a just\nbecause of my experience in the field also\n\n678\n00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:29,811\nbecause I have some ESP or\nsomething like that.\n\n679\n00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,346\nI've developed a sense when\nsomething doesn't look right,\n\n680\n00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:35,511\nor I might wanna take an extra look at it\nor run one of these different scans, or\n\n681\n00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,510\nuse a different tool or what have you.\n\n682\n00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,045\nYou will develop the same thing.\n\n683\n00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:45,040\nSo, you'd be definitely ready to do\nthat it's gonna be to your advantage.\n\n684\n00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,860\n>> Absolutely, and one thing we'll\nprobably talk about in some of our later,\n\n685\n00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,240\nwhen we get into more of the attack phase,\n\n686\n00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,620\nsome of these routers when you're\ndoing that half-open type thing.\n\n687\n00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,600\nIn order to protect some attack factors,\nthat we can do with that they might\n\n688\n00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,780\nactually send that acknowledgement\npacket on behalf of the host.\n\n689\n00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,001\nSo, that could throw our\nresults off a little bit.\n\n690\n00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:06,159\nAnd so having these different options and\n\n691\n00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,797\nbeing able to compare the results\nreally gives us the bigger picture,\n\n692\n00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:12,735\nallows us to bring that picture\ninto focus a little bit.\n\n693\n00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:15,410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n694\n00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,240\n>> All right, we've gone over a bunch\nof type of scans that you need to be\n\n695\n00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,120\nfamiliar with, remember Sean\nstressed we've got to know end map.\n\n696\n00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,880\nWe've got to know those parameters, the\noptions and the parameters that go with\n\n697\n00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,200\nthem for the exam, as well as for\nbeing successful as a pen tester.\n\n698\n00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,480\nSo we've shown you a few of those.\n\n699\n00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,220\nWe've talked about TCP.\n\n700\n00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,260\nWe've talked about UDP scans.\n\n701\n00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,610\nTalked all about the different\nflags that we can put in there.\n\n702\n00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,120\nWhere is all this heading?\n\n703\n00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:42,050\nWhat's our next step in our scanning?\n\n704\n00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,270\nWhat are we trying to get out of this,\nreally, I guess?\n\n705\n00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:48,450\n>> Well, our next step is to start\ngaining more detailed information\n\n706\n00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,140\nabout our network.\n\n707\n00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:53,837\nAnd that's what we really wanna do.\n\n708\n00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:59,020\nBut let me just, really quickly\nhere cuz I'm thinking about it.\n\n709\n00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:03,420\nI just want to give you just\nanother look at things.\n\n710\n00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:08,500\nWhat I did is when you were talking here,\nMike I brought up Zenmap on my screen.\n\n711\n00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,400\nThis is just something to kinda\nshow you the other face of Zenmap,\n\n712\n00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,138\nso to speak,\nif you haven't seen it already.\n\n713\n00:37:16,138 --> 00:37:19,320\nThis is Nmap, if you went to Nmap.org and\n\n714\n00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,240\ndownloaded the bundle\nwhich I have already seen.\n\n715\n00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,410\nI guess Michael, you provided a path\nto an executable, and the hash and\n\n716\n00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,820\neverything up there.\n\n717\n00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:35,090\nBut if you go to Nmap.org,\nyou will get Zenmap on top Nmap.\n\n718\n00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,553\nLike I said, for the exam they're more\nthan likely not gonna give you just\n\n719\n00:37:38,553 --> 00:37:42,820\nZenmap, as something that\nyou need to take a look at.\n\n720\n00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,030\nThey're gonna give you results from Nmap,\nand\n\n721\n00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,230\nask you how to run Nmap\ncommand line switches.\n\n722\n00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,670\n>> I tell you what and I apologize,\n\n723\n00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,900\nI forgot we were gonna go into\nthe GUI version as well here as Nmap.\n\n724\n00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,275\nOne of the really cool things\nhere I like about this GUI,\n\n725\n00:37:56,275 --> 00:38:00,130\ncuz we talked about how it's great to\nbe tech, work from the command line,\n\n726\n00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,140\nyou seem some more geeky somehow.\n\n727\n00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,680\nBut notice that it has\nthat command line there.\n\n728\n00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,220\nSo if you're trying to learn Nmap,\nand you're trying to learn all those\n\n729\n00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,680\nparameters and those switches, in here you\ncan go through your different tabs and\n\n730\n00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,630\nyou can configure your different options,\nport ranges, IP addresses or\n\n731\n00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:19,630\nwhatever it is you're doing,\nsetting different flags on and off.\n\n732\n00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,350\nAnd it's gonna show you the command,\nthat 's gonna execute in the background.\n\n733\n00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,990\nSo it really is a way to learn\nsome of those commands as well.\n\n734\n00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,370\n>> Yeah.\n\n735\n00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,485\nI'm glad you bring that up, Mike.\n\n736\n00:38:28,485 --> 00:38:31,310\nCuz that's one of the things\nI also mention with this too,\n\n737\n00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,402\nas I point out when I'm talking about.\n\n738\n00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:37,730\nAbout Zenmap is the fact that we'll all\njust type in my loop MAC address, so\n\n739\n00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:42,970\nyou guys can see that the command\nline is getting built with that.\n\n740\n00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,200\nIt's really great to get that feedback.\n\n741\n00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,195\nI kind of look at Zenmap as Nmap\nwith the training wheels on.\n\n742\n00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,971\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's not a derogatory thing\n\n743\n00:38:52,971 --> 00:38:53,490\nby the way.\n\n744\n00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,664\n[CROSSTALK] I don't wanna anyone here,\nI don't need training wheels or anything.\n\n745\n00:38:56,664 --> 00:38:59,250\nI use Zenmap all the time myself.\n\n746\n00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,610\nI know how to use Nmap\nat the command line, but\n\n747\n00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:06,740\nI use Zenmap all the time because,\nI'm a little lazy and I just wanna do,\n\n748\n00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,930\nand I wanna do it that way,\nI guess if you wanna put it like that.\n\n749\n00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:17,290\nSo, I like the fact that the command line\nis there, it shows you what's going on.\n\n750\n00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,220\nI would use this if you're trying to run\nsome of the different scans which you can\n\n751\n00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,286\npick these profiles over here,\n\n752\n00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:27,940\non the side you'll notice it will say\nthings like ping scan and stuff like that.\n\n753\n00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,730\nYou'll notice that that actually\nchanges the command line to reflect it.\n\n754\n00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,220\nYes you can change these scan types you\ncould type in your own command in there,\n\n755\n00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:41,160\nyou can start your own profiles\nin there to do different things.\n\n756\n00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:46,612\nIt's all up to you, but you can look at,\nsee different switches pop up there,\n\n757\n00:39:46,612 --> 00:39:50,669\nthings like that,\nsee what that means, and research it.\n\n758\n00:39:50,669 --> 00:39:54,496\nProfiles, if you want to set\nup a new profile in here,\n\n759\n00:39:54,496 --> 00:39:57,312\nall you have to do is just give it a name.\n\n760\n00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:59,700\nAnd you can start setting\nup the different things.\n\n761\n00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,480\nKinda what we just talked about, right?\n\n762\n00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:06,130\nWe saw some of these switches\nthat we've gone through.\n\n763\n00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:06,940\nYou'll see 'em.\n\n764\n00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,510\nBut I didn't show 'em all.\n\n765\n00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,060\nI just can't show 'em all.\n\n766\n00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,880\n>> Right.\n>> In here.\n\n767\n00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,365\nBut, [LAUGH] That's what you have.\n\n768\n00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:18,270\nHeck there's your l command, and.\n\n769\n00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,700\nYou're just kind of going through and\ndoing this.\n\n770\n00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,890\nI would strongly recommend that you,\nif you're gonna use Zenmap which I'm sure,\n\n771\n00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,318\nI can already see in the room-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n772\n00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:29,221\n>> A lot of people are saying,\n\n773\n00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:32,130\nthank God I don't have to type [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Command from, you're telling me,\n\n774\n00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,405\nwhy didn't you show me this first?\n\n775\n00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:36,090\n>> [LAUGH] I'm almost waiting for a couple\nof people here going, wait, wait, wait,\n\n776\n00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:37,815\nthis is a command line tool, too?\n\n777\n00:40:37,815 --> 00:40:39,895\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They never even looked at that one.\n\n778\n00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:46,105\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I mean that's fine.\n\n779\n00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:51,595\nI see Mike in here, saying,\nGUIs are easy, simply put.\n\n780\n00:40:51,595 --> 00:40:52,485\nYeah.\n\n781\n00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:55,335\nI'm not gonna even argue\nwith that one bit.\n\n782\n00:40:55,335 --> 00:40:55,955\nI 100, 100% agree.\n\n783\n00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:59,995\nBut you, you do,\nyou should always know the command line.\n\n784\n00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:03,450\nYou should always know what's\ngoing on behind the scenes.\n\n785\n00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:09,020\nI mean, heck, there's cases where Nmap,\nor Zenmap won't run on a system.\n\n786\n00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,660\n>> Right.\n>> Okay?\n\n787\n00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,735\nBut Nmap will.\n\n788\n00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:12,690\nNmap is a very small footprint.\n\n789\n00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:14,490\nIt's a small executable.\n\n790\n00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:17,640\nIt pretty much will run on\nalmost any system you get.\n\n791\n00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:22,320\nZenmap won't, and\nZenmap just plain simple may not be there.\n\n792\n00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,510\n>> Right.\n\n793\n00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:28,133\n>> Some of these dis rows,\nand Linux and some other\n\n794\n00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:32,290\nsituations that you're not gonna be able\nto just, the GUI can be there, but you\n\n795\n00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:35,610\nwon't be able to run it for privileges,\npurposes, or something like that.\n\n796\n00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,590\n>> Absolutely, and we'll get into our\nattacking phase and things like that.\n\n797\n00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,570\nThere's gonna be times where we\nmight want to set up back doors and\n\n798\n00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:44,610\ninsert programs under that target system.\n\n799\n00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,180\nAnd can I go and\ninstall Zenmap on their system like that?\n\n800\n00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:51,932\nProbably not as, nearly as easy as\nI know I can get Nmap on there.\n\n801\n00:41:51,932 --> 00:41:53,350\n>> Alright.\n>> Teamed to like using a teeny,\n\n802\n00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,150\ntiny footprint.\n\n803\n00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:55,830\nWe can get that over there\nto the target system.\n\n804\n00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,890\nGet that running on that target system.\n\n805\n00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,380\nAnd then start doing\nthings from the inside.\n\n806\n00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,080\nSo, definitely needed to\nknow both sides of it.\n\n807\n00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,890\nI love the fact that you\npointed those profiles.\n\n808\n00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:05,970\nI think those are fantastic.\n\n809\n00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,440\nI can take the time to develop\nsome different options,\n\n810\n00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,360\nlike I want to start out with a really\nslow sweep and things like that.\n\n811\n00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,240\nAnd instead of typing those things out\nevery time, I hit my drop down list, and\n\n812\n00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,230\nI hit it.\n\n813\n00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,530\nAnd I see my results and\nif I feel I want to speed it up,\n\n814\n00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,520\nI just change my profile and\nhit it again and go.\n\n815\n00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,590\nSo it's very very convenient.\n\n816\n00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,710\n>> Yeah, it's a big time saver and\n\n817\n00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,650\nyou do want to be able to do\nthis as quickly as possible.\n\n818\n00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,860\nSo yeah, this is something\nI'd say go ahead and use it.\n\n819\n00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:37,120\nLet me kinda throw a monkey\nwrench into this though,\n\n820\n00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,140\non the whole GUI issue in here.\n\n821\n00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,080\nIt's like I said, it's a Window,\nit is a Windows world, right?\n\n822\n00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,810\nYou said about 90% of the platforms?\n\n823\n00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,330\n>> Yeah.\n>> I bet, that's the last time I heard\n\n824\n00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:52,230\nit's doing that as well,\nlet's think about something.\n\n825\n00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,590\nI know you do the Window's instructing and\nconsulting on and\n\n826\n00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:56,770\nthat's what I do as well.\n\n827\n00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,500\nRemember what they've got in\nthe server side, as of 2008,\n\n828\n00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,410\nthey have a mode of Window's\nserver that doesn't have a gooey.\n\n829\n00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,995\nYou can't get a gooey on it.\n\n830\n00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:08,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you happen to,\n\n831\n00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:13,360\nif it happens to be the system that you\ncompromise, and you wanna push Nmap onto\n\n832\n00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:18,770\nit, or you're, I don't care if you got\nthe whole package with Zenmap on it,\n\n833\n00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,880\nyou are not getting a GUI on there,\nperiod.\n\n834\n00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,570\nYou're done.\n\n835\n00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,300\nSo, you have to know the command line.\n\n836\n00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,305\nSo, that's not just gonna,\nwe're not saying this to kinda\n\n837\n00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:29,335\nshake our fingers at anybody and\ngo you will, you should be learning that.\n\n838\n00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:30,045\nI'm just telling you and\n\n839\n00:43:30,045 --> 00:43:34,000\ngiving you motivation so to realize why\nthere are some benefits to knowing both.\n\n840\n00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,547\nBut use whatever you want but\nyou remember those little details.\n\n841\n00:43:39,547 --> 00:43:40,257\n>> Hm, absolutely.\n\n842\n00:43:40,257 --> 00:43:42,967\nIt just goes back to having\nmore tools in your arsenal.\n\n843\n00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:46,285\nAnd then being able to pick the right tool\nfor the job so that you can be efficient.\n\n844\n00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:48,870\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n845\n00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,000\n>> [COUGH] Oh right, so\nwhere do we want to head next.\n\n846\n00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,560\nWe want to do some of the Gui interface.\n\n847\n00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,080\nWe've already seen the scans of them.\n\n848\n00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,110\nWe don't really have to run any,\nwith the Gui.\n\n849\n00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,370\n>> Yeah, I'm going to worry about\nrunning the scans with the Gui and\n\n850\n00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,880\nI know a lot of you already\ndoing this though, so,\n\n851\n00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,350\nI'm not gonna like I said,\nI'm not gonna worry about this,\n\n852\n00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:14,710\nthat part of it so, you guys go ahead and\ncontinue on with that yourself.\n\n853\n00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:20,150\nBut I think we can start going on talking\nabout that network mapping part of it.\n\n854\n00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,995\nAnd not to be confused with Nmap.\n\n855\n00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:24,665\nNmap is short for network mapper,.\n\n856\n00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:25,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But we're looking\n\n857\n00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,180\nat something a little different\nfrom a little different angle.\n\n858\n00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:30,450\nWhat we have is,\n\n859\n00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:34,880\nwe talk about network mapping,\nyeah I've got one up here on screen.\n\n860\n00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,670\nThis is just the demo of it cause\nI don't wanna run a scan and\n\n861\n00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,110\nmap out, this network.\n\n862\n00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,490\nSomeone will stab me today if I do that.\n\n863\n00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,102\n>> Right, Sean.\n\n864\n00:44:44,102 --> 00:44:44,614\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n865\n00:44:44,614 --> 00:44:45,114\n>> Yeah.\n\n866\n00:44:45,114 --> 00:44:47,620\nSo >> The red shirt\ncombination might come through.\n\n867\n00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,245\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n868\n00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:50,585\n>> [LAUGH] This is something\nI wanna be careful with.\n\n869\n00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:53,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But this is a demo, and\n\n870\n00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:55,780\nI think it's kind of, it would be more\ninteresting even if I didn't want to run\n\n871\n00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:59,040\na scan on the network here.\n\n872\n00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,560\nIt's more interesting to see something\nlike this cuz it does illustrate with\n\n873\n00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,780\nlike this can do.\n\n874\n00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,050\nAnd what you're seeing here is,\nthis is a friendly pinger.\n\n875\n00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,410\nIt's definitely not the only\none that does this, but\n\n876\n00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:15,030\nit's one of the more common ones\nthat people are familiar with.\n\n877\n00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,540\nThere's ones like lands, surveyor,\nsolar winds has it's own.\n\n878\n00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,870\nThey all pretty much do the same thing.\n\n879\n00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:22,990\nWhat it does,\n\n880\n00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,280\nhaving to get to build a network map\nwith something with a tool like this.\n\n881\n00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,460\nYou can see, even though this is\na demo map, totally understand that.\n\n882\n00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:35,150\nIt's not live data, it's one that ships\nwith the product, I mean you could see,\n\n883\n00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:38,490\nif you ran this on a network,\nit will scan a subnet that you give it or\n\n884\n00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:42,880\none it detects, it will by default take\nthe subnet that you're on, and say, okay,\n\n885\n00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,550\nI'll scan the whole thing, and\nit will find devices that are there.\n\n886\n00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:51,880\nI mean, you can imagine that value of\nhaving something like this having a map,\n\n887\n00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,910\nbecause now you can start\npicking out devices.\n\n888\n00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:59,915\nSome of these things, when you, when go\nand you click on certain things inside\n\n889\n00:45:59,915 --> 00:46:02,815\nof it, they will actually give\nyou additional information.\n\n890\n00:46:02,815 --> 00:46:05,175\nThis one isn't because it's just a demo.\n\n891\n00:46:05,175 --> 00:46:08,705\nButsome of them will actually populate it\nwith additional information, it finds,\n\n892\n00:46:08,705 --> 00:46:12,480\nlike, IP address,\nan operating system and stuff like that,\n\n893\n00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,400\nwhich should be a little bit frightening\nwhen you, [LAUGH] when you think about it.\n\n894\n00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,600\nThe populated host name and then they\nput the operating system in there.\n\n895\n00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,370\nSo it's kinda combine some of\nthe stuff that Nmap does, cuz Nmap,\n\n896\n00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,500\neven though we didn't see it,\n\n897\n00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:29,780\nNmap will detect an OS because it\nidentifies the unique fingerprints.\n\n898\n00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,480\nThat come back.\n\n899\n00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:32,970\nIt can definitely do that.\n\n900\n00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:34,350\nThis one kind of does that,\n\n901\n00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:38,050\nplus also maps out where things\nare in relation to one another.\n\n902\n00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:42,290\nSo it's a really awesome tool that,\nto have at your disposal.\n\n903\n00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,890\nSomething I'll mention on this is that,\nfriendly pinger is pretty basic.\n\n904\n00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:48,930\nYou can look at this thing.\n\n905\n00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:51,805\nIt's got a really nice,\nslick Windows 98 interface.\n\n906\n00:46:51,805 --> 00:46:55,130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So [LAUGH] It's got that.\n\n907\n00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,245\n>> Little hyper terminal style icons,\nor something, yeah.\n\n908\n00:46:57,245 --> 00:46:57,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n909\n00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,520\nthis is like as old school as you can get.\n\n910\n00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,370\nYeah.\n\n911\n00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,835\nWhen they made this they were giving\naway fire as a prize on game shows.\n\n912\n00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:07,830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's that old.\n\n913\n00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:13,460\nSo it was, it's real, it's an old\nutility but it still gets the job done.\n\n914\n00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:19,330\nBut there are newer ones\nthat do more than this.\n\n915\n00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:22,162\nIn fact a solar winds\noffering in this area,\n\n916\n00:47:22,162 --> 00:47:26,290\nsolar wind's offering can\nactually export out to you Visio.\n\n917\n00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:26,800\n>> Yeah.\n\n918\n00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,940\n>> So that's pretty sweet that you\ncan export right out to that and I,\n\n919\n00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:38,020\nthe one, something I also like about\nthe solar winds tool is it can actually,\n\n920\n00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,600\nit will by default password\nprotect all your network maps.\n\n921\n00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,160\n>> Nice.\n>> So.\n\n922\n00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,511\n>> Nice [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] So\n\n923\n00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:47,450\nit's great to have.\n>> And that's a good point.\n\n924\n00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:48,660\nIf we kind of take from that,\n\n925\n00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,780\nthese are network admin tools, right?\nI mean these aren't hacking tools and\n\n926\n00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,041\nthings like that.\nWe're just repurposing them.\n\n927\n00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,185\nI think which we talked about in other\n\n928\n00:47:56,185 --> 00:48:00,678\nepisodes, a lot of these tools start out\nas general or actual Admin tools that\n\n929\n00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:03,939\nserve a very good purpose on my network.\nAs a network admin,\n\n930\n00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:07,120\nit's important that I have a map.\nAnd I don't wanna try to do it by hand,\n\n931\n00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,795\nI've got tools that can go out there and\ndiscover this.\n\n932\n00:48:08,795 --> 00:48:12,360\nSolarWinds, extremely powerful,\nthey have a lot of different software.\n\n933\n00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,412\nIt also comes at a pretty nice price tag.\n\n934\n00:48:14,412 --> 00:48:20,660\nBut if that's what you need, then it's\nworth every penny that you pay for it.\n\n935\n00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:25,682\nSo we're just really taking these things\nand repurposing them, and using them from\n\n936\n00:48:25,682 --> 00:48:29,120\nthe attacker's perspective, to do\nthe same thing a network admin would.\n\n937\n00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:32,730\nI'm trying to get a map of that network,\nthis is my documentation of,\n\n938\n00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:33,364\nof my targets.\n\n939\n00:48:33,364 --> 00:48:35,076\n>> Absolutely.\n\n940\n00:48:35,076 --> 00:48:40,250\nAnd it's also worth mentioning,\nas you mentioned,\n\n941\n00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,675\nMike, yeah, SolarWinds does have a pretty\nsteep price tag on certain things.\n\n942\n00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:48,490\nBut yeah, you have stuff like this,\nthere's Friendly Pinger.\n\n943\n00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:53,235\nYou also have stuff like Spiceworks,\nis another one that's out there.\n\n944\n00:48:53,235 --> 00:48:55,480\nSpiceworks is a free utility.\n\n945\n00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,220\nThey pay for, or you have to pay for\n\n946\n00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,340\nthings like support, and some of\nthe extra plug-ins that go with it.\n\n947\n00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,496\nBut if memory serves,\nI believe in the default product,\n\n948\n00:49:04,496 --> 00:49:08,651\njust the standard free one, it does\nhave the ability to do mapping as well.\n\n949\n00:49:08,651 --> 00:49:14,902\nSo you've got options out there\nto do this without paying for it.\n\n950\n00:49:14,902 --> 00:49:17,830\n>> All right.\n\n951\n00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,480\nAll right, so\nyou have mapping a network again.\n\n952\n00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,930\nReally, why are we mapping\na network in the first place?\n\n953\n00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:29,040\nWe talk about getting all the information\nwe can, finding out about our target, and\n\n954\n00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,500\nseeing what's visible, right?\n\n955\n00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,355\nAs a pen tester,\n\n956\n00:49:31,355 --> 00:49:36,060\nwhat could the, the bad guy discover if\nhe was able to do something like this?\n\n957\n00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,030\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n958\n00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,738\nWhat could they find when\nthey're poking around?\n\n959\n00:49:41,738 --> 00:49:48,765\nSo we've got a pretty good map on the one\nI showed in this demo, demonstration map.\n\n960\n00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:52,865\nYou know, I saw that someone asked,\n\n961\n00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:57,901\nwhat about the wi-fi\naccess points on this?\n\n962\n00:49:57,901 --> 00:50:03,823\nIt's just because, when they set up this\nexample they didn't really include those.\n\n963\n00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:05,660\nThey didn't decide to include those.\n\n964\n00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,580\nBut if those were there\nthey would pick them up.\n\n965\n00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:14,210\n>> So just because it's not on\nthis diagram, this demo diagram,\n\n966\n00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:20,020\nit doesn't mean it won't pick up.\n\n967\n00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,910\n>> Right.\n\n968\n00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:25,277\nI think Michaela beat me to that\none there, very good Michaela.\n\n969\n00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:27,442\nThey kind of want to show us all\nthe different options that you can get.\n\n970\n00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:30,618\nI mean, it's pretty cool that it will pick\nup satellites, if we've got that as part\n\n971\n00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:33,689\nof our network and things like that, so\nshowing us all the cool options we can do.\n\n972\n00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:36,553\n>> I know I have my own\npersonal satellite.\n\n973\n00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:40,624\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> NASA's scheduled to launch\n\n974\n00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:43,433\nmine next week\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n975\n00:50:43,433 --> 00:50:44,631\n>> Which means I'll never get it.\n\n976\n00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:47,326\nI'm gonna go over to that company in\nFrance to get them to do it for me.\n\n977\n00:50:47,326 --> 00:50:48,975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why don't you just sling one of\n\n978\n00:50:48,975 --> 00:50:50,538\nthose water balloon launchers and go.\n\n979\n00:50:50,538 --> 00:50:53,740\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, good stuff, good stuff.\n\n980\n00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:59,050\nAll right, so network mapping, again,\nan important part of our scanning phase.\n\n981\n00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:01,470\nIt's one of the outputs\nthat we're gonna take.\n\n982\n00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:05,980\nRemember we always talk about the output\nfrom one phase is gonna turn around and\n\n983\n00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,370\nbe the input for our next phase.\n\n984\n00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:12,280\nSo mapping that network,\ngetting that documented, what else?\n\n985\n00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,060\nDo we wanna hit some\nvulnerability scanners, or?\n\n986\n00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,085\n>> Let's start talking about\nvulnerability scanners just a bit,\n\n987\n00:51:20,085 --> 00:51:22,380\ncuz that's the next step here.\n\n988\n00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,975\nIt's kind of a bigger topic.\n\n989\n00:51:24,975 --> 00:51:28,294\nBut we'll start talking about it,\nand then,\n\n990\n00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:31,451\nlater on we'll start\ndemoing it a bit more.\n\n991\n00:51:31,451 --> 00:51:35,827\nThat's what we have coming up here,\nis vulnerability scanning.\n\n992\n00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,393\nWhat I want to get out of the way first,\ncuz that's where this,\n\n993\n00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:41,845\nthis conversation is heading, is that\nwe've seen, some of the types of scanning.\n\n994\n00:51:41,845 --> 00:51:46,075\nWe've seen finding if hosts are live,\nwe've done port scans,\n\n995\n00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:48,525\nwe've done the network mapping as we saw.\n\n996\n00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:52,175\nBut yes, there is a vulnerability\nscanning that goes into this.\n\n997\n00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:56,825\nWhat I kind of want to get out of the way\nbefore we even move into that is,\n\n998\n00:51:56,825 --> 00:52:00,640\nwhat's the difference between doing\nvulnerability scanning and pen testing?\n\n999\n00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,590\nThere is a difference,\nthere is definitely a difference.\n\n1000\n00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:07,160\nAnd it's important that you\nunderstand what that difference is.\n\n1001\n00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:13,400\nA vulnerability scan is\nwhere we are looking for\n\n1002\n00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,130\njust weaknesses, those vulnerabilities,\nit's in the name, okay.\n\n1003\n00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,000\nBut there's no implication or\n\n1004\n00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,800\naction there to take advantage\nof those vulnerabilities.\n\n1005\n00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,670\nWhen we go to pen testing,\nwe're finding those vulnerabilities and\n\n1006\n00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:29,560\nwe are trying to penetrate or\nexploit those vulnerabilities,\n\n1007\n00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,550\nto see if we can cause an exposure and\na security incident.\n\n1008\n00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:37,360\nBecause we're trying to inform that\ncompany, or that target, just how\n\n1009\n00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,020\nbad the situation is and what could be\ndone with those holes that they find.\n\n1010\n00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,370\nSo that's where vulnerability\nscanning fits in.\n\n1011\n00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,960\nVulnerability scanning is\njust doing an audit to find\n\n1012\n00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,404\nout where the weaknesses are.\n\n1013\n00:52:48,404 --> 00:52:52,185\nAnd then pen testing is finding out\njust how bad those weakness are,\n\n1014\n00:52:52,185 --> 00:52:56,227\nwhat could we do with them if we exploit,\nif we actually take advantage,\n\n1015\n00:52:56,227 --> 00:52:57,908\nif we actually exploit them?\n\n1016\n00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,264\nHow far down the rabbit\nhole can we actually go?\n\n1017\n00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,365\n>> All right, nice.\n\n1018\n00:53:02,365 --> 00:53:05,788\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen, looking\nat our clock, it's about that time,\n\n1019\n00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:07,736\nwe're gonna go ahead and\ntake our break here.\n\n1020\n00:53:07,736 --> 00:53:11,745\nWhen we come back, more scanning,\nso stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1021\n00:53:11,745 --> 00:53:18,329\n[SOUND].\n\n1022\n00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:22,690\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen, back into our scanning chapter.\n\n1023\n00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,770\nNext up on our list of topics\nis vulnerability scanners.\n\n1024\n00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,780\nSo let's talk about why we,\nwhat a vulnerability scanner is, and\n\n1025\n00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:34,100\nhow it fits into our scanning\nphase of our hacking process.\n\n1026\n00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:39,860\n>> Yeah, we need to talk about\nwhat vulnerability scanning is,\n\n1027\n00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:46,160\nwhy you should care, what is to does,\nand where it kinda fits in the process.\n\n1028\n00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:52,940\nVulnerability scanning, it isn't\nthe same as full on penetration testing.\n\n1029\n00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,135\nIt isn't scanning for\npeople that are feeling vulnerable.\n\n1030\n00:53:55,135 --> 00:53:58,200\n>> [LAUGH\n>> That's what I'm feeling right now.\n\n1031\n00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,730\nSo, but-\n>> After\n\n1032\n00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,727\nbeing chastised-\n>> Yes.\n\n1033\n00:54:00,727 --> 00:54:01,543\n>> For\nhaving to put on your microphone there.\n\n1034\n00:54:01,543 --> 00:54:02,336\n>> Yeah.\n\n1035\n00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:06,560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I cannot hear you, Captain,\n\n1036\n00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:09,820\nit's just not fitting on.\n\n1037\n00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:14,330\nBut yeah, what vulnerability scanning is,\ncompare and contrast it with pen testing,\n\n1038\n00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:19,050\nis pen testing, like I said earlier,\n\n1039\n00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:24,543\njust to reiterate, pen testing is\nactually going in and seeing what,\n\n1040\n00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:28,690\nfinding vulnerabilities and seeing how\nfar you can take those vulnerabilities,\n\n1041\n00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,590\ntake them to their logical conclusion.\n\n1042\n00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:34,600\nTo see what we can break, so to speak.\n\n1043\n00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,950\nWhat it means to go into\nthose vulnerabilities and\n\n1044\n00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,000\nactually start interacting with them,\nsee how far we can get into a system.\n\n1045\n00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,521\nA vulnerability scan, on the other hand,\n\n1046\n00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:48,141\nis finding out where those weaknesses are,\nand generating a report on it, and\n\n1047\n00:54:48,141 --> 00:54:53,111\ngiving those to someone, perhaps in IT or\nwhomever, that they will look at those and\n\n1048\n00:54:53,111 --> 00:54:56,040\nsay, hey,\nthis is where our weaknesses are.\n\n1049\n00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,010\nBut they still don't know just how far\nsomeone could take those vulnerabilities\n\n1050\n00:55:01,010 --> 00:55:05,485\nto cause problems on the system,\nlike I said, that's what pen testing does.\n\n1051\n00:55:05,485 --> 00:55:09,910\nOkay, so pen testing, then, just takes\nthat vulnerability scan to the next step,\n\n1052\n00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:13,490\nuses that output from the vulnerability\nscan to go further in and\n\n1053\n00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:14,570\nsee what's under the hood there.\n\n1054\n00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:17,690\nWhat we can actually do\nwith those vulnerabilities.\n\n1055\n00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:18,572\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1056\n00:55:18,572 --> 00:55:21,680\nNow, something I should\nalso throw into this,\n\n1057\n00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,460\nis that why we are talking\nabout vulnerability scanners\n\n1058\n00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:30,860\nhere in the scanning section, the thing\nto remember is it's probably, unless\n\n1059\n00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:35,050\nyou're not worried about drawing attention\nto yourself, a vulnerability scanner is\n\n1060\n00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:40,390\nprobably not something you would use as a\nhacker to go in and scan an organization.\n\n1061\n00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,756\nThey are not designed to be\nall that stealthy, all right?\n\n1062\n00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:45,101\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's just not their job.\n\n1063\n00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:47,340\nTheir job is to find those weaknesses.\n\n1064\n00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,745\nSo you look at, for example,\n\n1065\n00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:55,433\nI know some of you had asked about\nEC-Council's official material.\n\n1066\n00:55:55,433 --> 00:55:59,117\nOne of the things that they will\nkind of put out there is that,\n\n1067\n00:55:59,117 --> 00:56:04,031\nyeah, go ahead and use a vulnerability\nscanner during Your scanning phase, and\n\n1068\n00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:05,155\nI don't know\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1069\n00:56:05,155 --> 00:56:06,904\n>> Where that reasoning comes from,\n\n1070\n00:56:06,904 --> 00:56:10,883\njust because it's called a scanner doesn't\nmean that it should come in during\n\n1071\n00:56:10,883 --> 00:56:11,585\nthat phase.\n\n1072\n00:56:11,585 --> 00:56:15,058\nSo what I would recommend\nif you're doing this,\n\n1073\n00:56:15,058 --> 00:56:20,308\nif you need to do it during the scanning\nphase, and you're, like I said,\n\n1074\n00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:25,074\nnot concerned about them detecting you,\nthen by all means use it.\n\n1075\n00:56:25,074 --> 00:56:27,520\nBut if you're trying to\nmaintain that stealthiness,\n\n1076\n00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,210\nthis is not the way to do it.\n\n1077\n00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,200\n>> Right.\n>> Just definitely remember that as\n\n1078\n00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:33,936\nyou're going through doing it.\n\n1079\n00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:38,080\n>> Yeah, as a pen-tester if we're\na white hat test or a white-box test or\n\n1080\n00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,720\nsomething like that where\neverybody knows we're there.\n\n1081\n00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,540\nWe got all the information,\nwe're not trying to be stealthy.\n\n1082\n00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:45,480\nMaybe it makes sense to use us here.\n\n1083\n00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,880\nIf you're an attacker, and\nyou're trying to be stealthy and\n\n1084\n00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,126\nyou're working against a target\nprobably not the thing to do.\n\n1085\n00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:55,460\n>> Yeah, you're definitely gone way beyond\njust what an Nmap scan or something.\n\n1086\n00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,090\nAnd by the way, Nessus does use,\none of the things I'm talking about,\n\n1087\n00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:02,030\ndoes use Nmap but you're going way\nbeyond the scans that we did before.\n\n1088\n00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:08,041\nYou're just looking for openings and\nrattling doorknobs, as I like to say.\n\n1089\n00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,408\nYou're not just rattling the door\nknob to see if it's open.\n\n1090\n00:57:10,408 --> 00:57:12,531\nI mean, you've got your foot in the door\njamb and you're yanking on it and\n\n1091\n00:57:12,531 --> 00:57:13,056\nstuff like that.\n\n1092\n00:57:13,056 --> 00:57:14,790\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1093\n00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:15,640\n>> They can hear that.\n\n1094\n00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,620\nIt's a lot more obvious.\n\n1095\n00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,984\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, so\n\n1096\n00:57:18,984 --> 00:57:23,061\nbe very careful when you use these things.\n\n1097\n00:57:23,061 --> 00:57:25,589\n>> And again not that we're promoting\nattacking somebody that you don't have\n\n1098\n00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:26,429\npermission on, right?\n\n1099\n00:57:26,429 --> 00:57:28,362\nThat's the whole thing about\nbeing an ethical hacker.\n\n1100\n00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:32,167\nSo I think more than anything to take\nout of this is you're probably not going\n\n1101\n00:57:32,167 --> 00:57:36,098\nto see the bad guys using an vulnerability\nscan in one of their actual attacks.\n\n1102\n00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:37,664\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1103\n00:57:37,664 --> 00:57:41,658\nSomething else that's worth noting when\nyou talk about a vulnerability scan,\n\n1104\n00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:45,415\nis a vulnerability scan you can set\ndifferent levels of scanning policy and\n\n1105\n00:57:45,415 --> 00:57:47,641\nwhat they're actually going to probe for.\n\n1106\n00:57:47,641 --> 00:57:51,604\nYou can do that, and\nyou can get different results.\n\n1107\n00:57:51,604 --> 00:57:56,110\nYou're gonna to see some that here in\nNessus that I'm gonna bring this up here.\n\n1108\n00:57:56,110 --> 00:58:00,070\nYou can see that it's got different\noptions and different things you can do.\n\n1109\n00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:05,101\nThe thing is that when you go into Nessus,\ndepending on what you set and\n\n1110\n00:58:05,101 --> 00:58:09,466\nwhat you do, you could become louder and\nlouder and louder.\n\n1111\n00:58:09,466 --> 00:58:12,275\nAnd at some point, you can get so\naggressive with what you do,\n\n1112\n00:58:12,275 --> 00:58:15,860\nand so loud that, I've actually had to\nlock up and crash systems at scanning.\n\n1113\n00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,500\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1114\n00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,880\n>> So you could pull a denial of\nservice on someone unintentionally.\n\n1115\n00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:26,320\nYou know I've experimented myself,\nscanning wireless access points.\n\n1116\n00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,470\n>> And\nI've had a couple actually lock up and\n\n1117\n00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:30,960\nthey had to be hard reset\nto bring them back to life.\n\n1118\n00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:31,730\n>> Really.\n>> So\n\n1119\n00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,050\nyou definitely need to be careful with it.\n\n1120\n00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:36,810\n>> But it is funny if it's someone elses.\n\n1121\n00:58:36,810 --> 00:58:37,332\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> No I'm kidding.\n\n1122\n00:58:37,332 --> 00:58:40,091\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1123\n00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:41,813\n>> Someone's going to write that down and\n\n1124\n00:58:41,813 --> 00:58:43,226\nwe're going to get in trouble.\n\n1125\n00:58:43,226 --> 00:58:45,351\n>> [LAUGH] Shawn said this was\na great way to do a DOS attack.\n\n1126\n00:58:45,351 --> 00:58:50,145\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's like let's rock and roll!\n\n1127\n00:58:50,145 --> 00:58:51,271\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1128\n00:58:51,271 --> 00:58:52,212\n>> Or how quaint.\n\n1129\n00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:54,197\nAll right, someone will put in there.\n\n1130\n00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,710\n>> I know, should I do it, you know?\n\n1131\n00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:59,776\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They say, this guy just used the mouse.\n\n1132\n00:58:59,776 --> 00:59:00,670\nHello computer.\n\n1133\n00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:07,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyway, back to Nessus.\n\n1134\n00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,500\n>> All right.\n\n1135\n00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,850\nLet me show you the scan for life forms.\n\n1136\n00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:14,442\nWell wait a minute,\nI mean scan for vulnerabilities.\n\n1137\n00:59:14,442 --> 00:59:18,991\nSo anyway, what you do, this is Nessus.\n\n1138\n00:59:18,991 --> 00:59:22,900\nNessus is a free vulnerability scanner.\n\n1139\n00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,080\nYou can get it from Tenable Security.\n\n1140\n00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:30,690\nAll you have to do is Google the name,\nNessus.\n\n1141\n00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,790\nYou go up there and download it.\n\n1142\n00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:35,110\nThey will require you to activate it.\n\n1143\n00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:39,780\nIt gives you a little code\nthrough an email, and\n\n1144\n00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:46,020\nwhat happens is with that code you will\ndrop it into Nessus and what happens is it\n\n1145\n00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:51,125\nwill download updates to the database so\nit can get all the latest vulnerabilities.\n\n1146\n00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:56,569\nIt's kind of like, if you kind of want to\nthink of it in terms of like an antivirus,\n\n1147\n00:59:56,569 --> 01:00:01,030\nwhere antivirus as soon as you install it,\nit's got to download the latest updates.\n\n1148\n01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:02,700\nThat's what this does too.\n\n1149\n01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,320\nAs soon as you install it, and activate\nit, it will download the latest updates\n\n1150\n01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,410\nand it will continue to do\nthat as long as you use it.\n\n1151\n01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,820\nSo it's kind of a cool thing, because\nwhen a new vulnerability is exposed,\n\n1152\n01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:21,048\nthey will quickly write a little check for\nit, or a way to check for it, and\n\n1153\n01:00:21,048 --> 01:00:24,820\nyou'll download another product and you're\nalready checking for that new thing.\n\n1154\n01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:30,280\nSo it's very dynamic, it's gonna check for\nincreased amounts of vulnerabilities.\n\n1155\n01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,617\nIt's really neat.\n\n1156\n01:00:31,617 --> 01:00:33,637\n>> It is, and\nthe fact that it's free is pretty cool.\n\n1157\n01:00:33,637 --> 01:00:36,251\n>> Yeah, and I would encourage you,\n\n1158\n01:00:36,251 --> 01:00:41,314\nthis is one of the things that you\ncan go through and use on your own.\n\n1159\n01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:45,677\nI know it's been mentioned here in\nthe discussion groups, it's what,\n\n1160\n01:00:45,677 --> 01:00:47,062\n$2,200 a year?\n\n1161\n01:00:47,062 --> 01:00:53,070\nYeah, and there is a version\nthat does cost you some bucks.\n\n1162\n01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:56,110\nWhat you want to do is when\nyou're on Tenable's site,\n\n1163\n01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:59,500\nmake sure you're getting the home version.\n\n1164\n01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,400\nDon't click on the business editions or\nanything like that.\n\n1165\n01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,080\nThe business editions,\nyou have to pay for.\n\n1166\n01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:11,054\nSo make sure you get\nthe home edition on there.\n\n1167\n01:01:11,054 --> 01:01:15,931\nSo if it's asking you to pay money or\nanything for it, you're in the wrong spot,\n\n1168\n01:01:15,931 --> 01:01:17,350\nplain and simple.\n\n1169\n01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:20,230\n>> Yeah, if you guys scroll down on that\nlink that I just posted in the chat room\n\n1170\n01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:23,050\nthere and I'll make sure those\nare available in the show notes,\n\n1171\n01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:25,040\nthere's a chart at\nthe bottom of that page.\n\n1172\n01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,525\nAnd they've got a home professional\nmanager in cloud options there.\n\n1173\n01:01:29,525 --> 01:01:32,990\nAnd obviously, the home one is gonna be a\nlittle more limited than the professional.\n\n1174\n01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:37,750\nIt adds things like mobile device\ndetection, patch management integration,\n\n1175\n01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:41,670\nsome different agents and dashboards, that\nI would need in an enterprise environment.\n\n1176\n01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:45,170\nBut you can definitely get your\nfeet wet with that home version.\n\n1177\n01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:47,815\nEverything we're gonna need to\ndo here is in the home version.\n\n1178\n01:01:47,815 --> 01:01:51,650\n>> Yeah, from what I understand\nit's changed a couple times but\n\n1179\n01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:52,830\nthe home edition,\n\n1180\n01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:57,936\nI believe the biggest difference in its\nlimitations is you can only scan 16 IPs.\n\n1181\n01:01:57,936 --> 01:01:59,430\n>> 16 is your limit, yep.\n\n1182\n01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:03,480\n>> The other ones you can\ndo greater numbers of it.\n\n1183\n01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:08,353\nOf course they don't want you\nto use the home edition for\n\n1184\n01:02:08,353 --> 01:02:10,408\ndoing scans on your business.\n\n1185\n01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:12,298\nYou could, but\nthat's not what they want and\n\n1186\n01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:15,460\nthey're gonna frown on that\nif they catch you doing it.\n\n1187\n01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:19,150\nFor what we're doing here, for\ntraining and practice, go for it,\n\n1188\n01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,030\nuse the home edition.\n\n1189\n01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:24,870\nBut if you're gonna use this\nprofessionally then yeah, they do a great\n\n1190\n01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:30,528\njob on it, it may seem expensive, but the\ntime it saves you is more than worth that.\n\n1191\n01:02:30,528 --> 01:02:31,503\n>> I agree.\n\n1192\n01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:36,830\nAll right so we're gonna take\na look inside of Nessus itself.\n\n1193\n01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:39,441\nSo I've gone through,\n\n1194\n01:02:39,441 --> 01:02:43,813\nI've set my self up an account inside\nof Nessus which you'll have to do.\n\n1195\n01:02:43,813 --> 01:02:46,351\nYou'll have to create a user\naccount with a password.\n\n1196\n01:02:46,351 --> 01:02:49,010\nYou'll have to download the updates,\nall that good stuff.\n\n1197\n01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,510\nAnd once you get that all done,\n\n1198\n01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:53,414\nit's going to bring you to\nits browser-based interface.\n\n1199\n01:02:53,414 --> 01:02:57,707\nAnd what you want to do before you do\nan actual scan is you will have to choose\n\n1200\n01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,840\na policy for that scan.\n\n1201\n01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:04,324\nAnd so the way you do that is you will\nclick on this Policies tab inside of\n\n1202\n01:03:04,324 --> 01:03:04,937\nNessus.\n\n1203\n01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:10,330\nAnd you can see on my screen that\nI don't have any policies defined.\n\n1204\n01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:13,180\nThat's something that I have to do.\n\n1205\n01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:18,310\nI have a choice of creating my own custom,\nor I can choose a predefined one.\n\n1206\n01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,860\nSo what I'm gonna do is click on this\nblue button over on the left-hand\n\n1207\n01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:22,880\nside saying New Policy.\n\n1208\n01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,530\nAnd you're going to see\nthis policy library.\n\n1209\n01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:27,020\nNow you'll notice this also\n\n1210\n01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,170\nkinda shows you the other differences\nbetween the free and paid version.\n\n1211\n01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,320\nYou can see that all those little\nthings with the purple banner on them,\n\n1212\n01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,360\nthose are all scan types\nthat you have to pay for.\n\n1213\n01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:42,670\nThese are all policies that they\nhave already preconfigured for\n\n1214\n01:03:42,670 --> 01:03:45,740\nyou, and check for things,\nhave the plugins for it.\n\n1215\n01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,176\nAnd just go right on and do their thing.\n\n1216\n01:03:48,176 --> 01:03:53,016\nSo you have a handful of things\nthat are great for what we do here.\n\n1217\n01:03:53,016 --> 01:03:57,415\nIf you need this other functionality then\nI would recommend that you go ahead and\n\n1218\n01:03:57,415 --> 01:03:58,013\nupgrade.\n\n1219\n01:03:58,013 --> 01:03:58,953\nI mean think about it.\n\n1220\n01:03:58,953 --> 01:04:01,943\nThis stuff can do PCI compliance.\n\n1221\n01:04:01,943 --> 01:04:06,155\nI think there's also plugins for\nHIPAA and stuff like that.\n\n1222\n01:04:06,155 --> 01:04:08,933\nI mean look at the PCI\nquarterly external scan and\n\n1223\n01:04:08,933 --> 01:04:13,560\nthat's something that if you're in that\npayment card history, you have to do.\n\n1224\n01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:17,047\nAnd like they're saying,\nyou have to do it four times a year.\n\n1225\n01:04:17,047 --> 01:04:21,400\n$2,200 is not that much [LAUGH]\nconsidering how much time this is gonna\n\n1226\n01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:22,030\nsave you.\n\n1227\n01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:31,527\nSo, what I'm gonna do just to kinda make\nit easy is I am gonna do a advanced scan.\n\n1228\n01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,540\nI'll do an advance scan up here.\n\n1229\n01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,710\nI will name the scan.\n\n1230\n01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,537\nI'll call it just a test.\n\n1231\n01:04:39,537 --> 01:04:44,241\nAnd, so I will go ahead and save that.\n\n1232\n01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:47,026\nBut if you take a look at this.\n\n1233\n01:04:47,026 --> 01:04:51,518\nI'll go ahead and save that in here so\nI have a test policy.\n\n1234\n01:04:51,518 --> 01:04:55,905\nWhat I'm gonna do is I'm gonna click\nover here on Scans and on Scans,\n\n1235\n01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,505\nI'm gonna say new scan.\n\n1236\n01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:03,775\nAnd, so it's asking me, okay, well let\nme choose one of these ones from here.\n\n1237\n01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,929\nI'll just go ahead and choose this guy.\n\n1238\n01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:09,853\nI'll do this one and what's your\nIP address over there again, Mike?\n\n1239\n01:05:09,853 --> 01:05:10,851\n>> Let's check.\n\n1240\n01:05:10,851 --> 01:05:14,485\n10.1.10.213 for the Windows box.\n\n1241\n01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:21,530\n>> Okay, so\nI'm gonna scan Mike's system over here.\n\n1242\n01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:24,430\nLet's go ahead, I'm gonna save that.\n\n1243\n01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:27,890\nIt's gonna do its dirty work here.\n\n1244\n01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:34,070\nYou can see it's actually scanning his\nsystem right now so it's doing its job.\n\n1245\n01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,330\nIt's gonna take a few moments here.\n\n1246\n01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:40,880\nAnd looks like it actually may be done.\n\n1247\n01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,270\n>> You know what,\nI might have given you the wrong,\n\n1248\n01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:44,090\nthat might be hooked up to\ntwo different networks.\n\n1249\n01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:48,128\nI'm gonna make sure it\nwas on the big side.\n\n1250\n01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:48,906\nYeah, it is, okay.\n\n1251\n01:05:48,906 --> 01:05:50,110\n>> It got you?\n\n1252\n01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:51,029\nOkay.\n\n1253\n01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:53,561\nIt won't really give me much of\nanything all that interesting.\n\n1254\n01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:57,277\nLet's try that again.\n\n1255\n01:05:57,277 --> 01:06:00,796\nGet in here and see if I can\nanything a little more interesting.\n\n1256\n01:06:00,796 --> 01:06:04,720\nYou said 10.1.10-\n>> 10.1.10.213?\n\n1257\n01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,403\n>> Okay.\n\n1258\n01:06:06,403 --> 01:06:11,279\nSo, I'll try it one more time,\nand see what I get.\n\n1259\n01:06:11,279 --> 01:06:13,740\nIt'll take a little, there could\nbe something filtering in here.\n\n1260\n01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:14,576\nHope not.\n\n1261\n01:06:14,576 --> 01:06:16,743\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1262\n01:06:16,743 --> 01:06:19,030\nOn demand scanning.\n\n1263\n01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:20,790\nWhat is your IP on your box there?\n\n1264\n01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:22,115\nLet's just make sure we're\non the same network.\n\n1265\n01:06:22,115 --> 01:06:24,965\nWe've got a couple different\nnetworks here ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1266\n01:06:24,965 --> 01:06:27,824\nwanna make sure we're all on the same one,\ncuz they are separated.\n\n1267\n01:06:33,084 --> 01:06:35,116\nThink I'm on the .10, unlike you.\n\n1268\n01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:39,493\n>> Wonder why you're,\nyeah you're on that 2 30.\n\n1269\n01:06:39,493 --> 01:06:41,025\n>> Oh, you wanna?\n\n1270\n01:06:41,025 --> 01:06:44,310\nTell you what, I got another IP address,\nit's that virtual machine.\n\n1271\n01:06:44,310 --> 01:06:49,558\nIt's actually 10.1.230.191.\n\n1272\n01:06:49,558 --> 01:06:52,681\nTry that one and I'll figure out why\nmy wired is on the wrong one here.\n\n1273\n01:06:52,681 --> 01:06:57,035\n>> [LAUGH] Okay, one more time.\n\n1274\n01:06:57,035 --> 01:07:04,860\n[LAUGH]\n>> 10.1.230.191.\n\n1275\n01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:07,855\n>> Okay,\nlet me put that back in here again.\n\n1276\n01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:08,912\nLet's see what we get.\n\n1277\n01:07:17,173 --> 01:07:21,754\nAll right, so this is something that,\nit's not unheard of for\n\n1278\n01:07:21,754 --> 01:07:26,260\nthis to sometimes happen for\nwhen you're scanning a system.\n\n1279\n01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:31,160\nSo, looks like it's behaving\na little bit better this time.\n\n1280\n01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:33,810\n>> And I've got another IP address for\nthe Windows box if we need it, too.\n\n1281\n01:07:33,810 --> 01:07:35,420\nI switched it over to\nthe same one you're on.\n\n1282\n01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:35,920\n>> Okay.\n\n1283\n01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:44,160\nSo, do expect the scans to take a few\nmoments when they do their dirty work.\n\n1284\n01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,590\nIt could take anywhere from a few\n\n1285\n01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:52,670\nseconds depending on what you're telling\nit to scan, up to a few minutes.\n\n1286\n01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:57,196\nIt is entirely possible that\nthat will happen, in some cases.\n\n1287\n01:07:57,196 --> 01:08:01,716\nI'm doing an advance scan that's not\nasking me to provide any credentials or\n\n1288\n01:08:01,716 --> 01:08:05,206\nanything like that so\nit really shouldn't take that long.\n\n1289\n01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:11,570\nBut it will take some time to give me\nsome results on Mike's box over here.\n\n1290\n01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:15,210\nWhen it's done, we'll get a nice\nreport that we can click through and\n\n1291\n01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:17,730\nkinda see what it found and\n\n1292\n01:08:17,730 --> 01:08:22,770\nit's actually quite interesting when\nyou look at what it finds, okay?\n\n1293\n01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:28,760\nThe thing about Nessus though,\nis the first time you actually use Nessus,\n\n1294\n01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:29,680\nit's not uncommon for\n\n1295\n01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:33,695\npeople to look at and freak out going,\nlook it, the thing's gonna explode.\n\n1296\n01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:34,810\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n1297\n01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:35,830\n>> What's going on?\n\n1298\n01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:37,145\nAnd check the warp core.\n\n1299\n01:08:37,145 --> 01:08:40,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Few more vulnerabilities than you\n\n1300\n01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:41,892\nthought you had, right?\n\n1301\n01:08:41,892 --> 01:08:45,410\n>> Yeah, and thing is,\nthis will find a lot of vulnerabilities.\n\n1302\n01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,460\nThat's just the way,\nthe nature of the beast.\n\n1303\n01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:49,315\nIt's gonna find vulnerabilities.\n\n1304\n01:08:49,315 --> 01:08:54,351\nBut definitely do not freak out and\nthink that, oh yeah, just because it found\n\n1305\n01:08:54,351 --> 01:08:59,098\na vulnerability we've got a problem\nthat we need to go ahead and resolve.\n\n1306\n01:08:59,098 --> 01:09:01,756\nRemember, when one of\nthe things I talked about,\n\n1307\n01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:05,640\nwhen we started this whole journey\nhere was that idea of risk.\n\n1308\n01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,610\nJust because that vulnerability is on\nthere doesn't mean in any way, shape, or\n\n1309\n01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:09,860\nform you've got a risk.\n\n1310\n01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,560\nIt just means that\nthere's a vulnerability.\n\n1311\n01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,672\nThat vulnerability might be very,\nvery minor.\n\n1312\n01:09:13,672 --> 01:09:16,260\nIt may be that they're\njust giving you an FYI.\n\n1313\n01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:20,740\nThey will actually rank\nthe vulnerabilities that they find on low,\n\n1314\n01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,340\nmedium, and high.\n\n1315\n01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,850\nIt's up to you to decide if\nyou wanna remediate it or not.\n\n1316\n01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:27,910\n>> If it's a low risk with low impact,\n\n1317\n01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,210\nyou might decide that it's not worth\nthe money that it's gonna take to\n\n1318\n01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:34,530\nmitigate that risk, so\nyou just choose to accept that risk.\n\n1319\n01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:35,280\n>> Yeah.\n\n1320\n01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,830\nThat's exactly right.\n\n1321\n01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:40,890\nYou can just go ahead and\nsay, okay, that's fine.\n\n1322\n01:09:40,890 --> 01:09:44,440\nIt's good to have the information\non hand to be able to make that.\n\n1323\n01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:45,180\nThat's the thing.\n\n1324\n01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,880\nYou can make the decision of whether or\nnot you want to fix it.\n\n1325\n01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,750\nIt's better to know about it and say yeah,\nI'm not gonna take it any further,\n\n1326\n01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:54,490\nthat's fine the way it is.\n\n1327\n01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:57,180\nOr you can say, oh, well,\nyeah, I am gonna take it.\n\n1328\n01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:59,410\nBut it's better to have the information,\nbe able to make the decision,\n\n1329\n01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:03,885\nthan not have it all and just kind of\nassume you're doing everything right.\n\n1330\n01:10:03,885 --> 01:10:06,885\nSo that's a really good thing.\n\n1331\n01:10:06,885 --> 01:10:09,085\nIt's also good to use those reports so\n\n1332\n01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:13,385\nthat you can save reports in here,\nover several scans, and\n\n1333\n01:10:13,385 --> 01:10:18,495\nyou can use them to compare and\nsee if anything's actually changed.\n\n1334\n01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:21,279\nYou can configure your own specific scans.\n\n1335\n01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:22,822\nI didn't do that here.\n\n1336\n01:10:22,822 --> 01:10:29,041\nI don't wanna turn this\ninto a Nessus course,\n\n1337\n01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:33,040\nbut it can-\n>> It could easily be though, right?\n\n1338\n01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,640\nI mean Nessus, as you can go from\nvery simple using their default stuff\n\n1339\n01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,457\nto very complex once\nyou're setting up with it.\n\n1340\n01:10:39,457 --> 01:10:40,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n1341\n01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:44,344\nSo, it looks like here's what\nwe found on your system, Mike.\n\n1342\n01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:47,304\nIt looks like it's doing pretty\nwell here with what it found.\n\n1343\n01:10:47,304 --> 01:10:49,157\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And granted,\n\n1344\n01:10:49,157 --> 01:10:52,770\nI didn't actually go through and\nconfigure too much on it.\n\n1345\n01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:56,555\nBut it said it found four\nvulnerabilities on the system.\n\n1346\n01:10:56,555 --> 01:10:59,630\nAnd you can expect to see\nsomething similar to this.\n\n1347\n01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,570\nDon't expect to see four\nvulnerabilities on your system, but\n\n1348\n01:11:02,570 --> 01:11:07,100\nyou can expect to see a formatted\nreport like this, and\n\n1349\n01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,370\nyou're saying okay,\nit finds some stuff here.\n\n1350\n01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:15,350\nI can click on any one of these and\nyou can see that, oh well,\n\n1351\n01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:20,180\nhere's something on the Ethernet\ncard on his system here.\n\n1352\n01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:24,945\nIts saying its able to identify,\nbased off that MAC address,\n\n1353\n01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:27,700\nit's able to identify\nwhat the manufacturer is.\n\n1354\n01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,576\nThat may not be a problem for you.\n\n1355\n01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:33,567\nIn fact, you may have noticed,\nI didn't point it out at the time, but\n\n1356\n01:11:33,567 --> 01:11:37,910\nyou may have noticed when I ran Enmap,\nEnmap was doing the exact same thing.\n\n1357\n01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:42,660\nEnmap can look out of those six pieces of\na MAC address, it can look at the first\n\n1358\n01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:45,980\nthree and say I know what that is\ncuz that's specific to a vendor.\n\n1359\n01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:47,650\nSo it looked at it.\n\n1360\n01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:48,825\nI'm seeing the same thing here.\n\n1361\n01:11:48,825 --> 01:11:53,300\nNessus is telling me I\ncan identify who that is.\n\n1362\n01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:53,970\nWho cares?\n\n1363\n01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,930\nIt says this one is Microsoft,\nI'm guessing.\n\n1364\n01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:58,022\nYeah, since you're in the virtual system.\n\n1365\n01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:02,360\nIt's fingering the virtual adapter and\nsaying it's Microsoft.\n\n1366\n01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:07,237\nTake that for what it's worth.\n\n1367\n01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:10,740\nMaybe you don't wanna fix that\nMaybe there's no need to fix it.\n\n1368\n01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:14,090\nIt's up to you.\nYou can use that.\n\n1369\n01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:19,290\nSome of these things, these list of\nvulnerabilities I've seen have been,\n\n1370\n01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,260\nit looks crazy.\n\n1371\n01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:25,050\nBut you go through it and you find,\nit's information on service packs,\n\n1372\n01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:28,140\nit's information on things\nthat are just an FYI for you.\n\n1373\n01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:30,180\nBut then, yeah,\nI'll get some ones that are way up.\n\n1374\n01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,700\nYou're like whoa,\nthat's something I need to address.\n\n1375\n01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,420\n>> Right.\n\n1376\n01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,690\n>> So yeah.\n\n1377\n01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,520\nIt's a pretty neat utility.\n\n1378\n01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,971\nIt's not the only one that does it and\nthat's all we'll worry for\n\n1379\n01:12:39,971 --> 01:12:44,010\nright now about showing you about Nessus,\njust so you can what Nessus does.\n\n1380\n01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:47,825\nSo instead of going through, doing more\nwith that, then let me tell you about some\n\n1381\n01:12:47,825 --> 01:12:50,502\nof the other vulnerability\nscanners that are out there.\n\n1382\n01:12:50,502 --> 01:12:55,645\nWe've got another good one is from Rapid7,\nthey've got one called Nexpose.\n\n1383\n01:12:55,645 --> 01:13:00,810\nNexpose is a really neat one\nthat you can get totally for\n\n1384\n01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:05,100\nfree and what's cool about that is,\nis if you're someone that's a user of\n\n1385\n01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,840\nMetasploit, which is a way\nto test software and\n\n1386\n01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,010\nother vulnerabilities, it can actually\ntake its results right over to Metasploit.\n\n1387\n01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:17,460\nSo if you're using that, that may\nbe a better one to use than Nessus.\n\n1388\n01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,585\nNessus also has a cousin called OpenVAS.\n\n1389\n01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:27,590\nEssentially what happened on that one is,\nwe had Nessus used to be just one\n\n1390\n01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:32,430\nproduct and at one point, they decided to\nkinda do that fork in the road type thing,\n\n1391\n01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:37,140\nwhere Nessus became a paid product,\nand OpenVAS became an open source one.\n\n1392\n01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:41,950\nSo they both have that common ancestor and\nthey're both related, but\n\n1393\n01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:44,590\nthey have kinda gone somewhat\ntheir own directions.\n\n1394\n01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:48,810\nNow, those are the free ones,\nthere are some paid ones.\n\n1395\n01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:53,090\nI believe there's stuff like Canvas and\nCore Impact.\n\n1396\n01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:56,060\nThose are very capable ones,\nbut you will pay for it.\n\n1397\n01:13:56,060 --> 01:14:01,230\nI think one of those is like $35,000\nto get started in it for one seat.\n\n1398\n01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:04,510\nSo, that's probably not gonna be\nsomething, unless you've got really deep\n\n1399\n01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:08,980\npockets, that you're gonna get\nas an individual pen tester.\n\n1400\n01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,366\nA company might buy that for you.\n\n1401\n01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:15,810\nBut just something to think about,\nthat there are other options.\n\n1402\n01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:16,950\n>> Saint was another one I remember.\n\n1403\n01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:17,780\n>> Saint is another one.\n\n1404\n01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:18,880\n>> Showing up in some of the material.\n\n1405\n01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,180\nAnd, of course, Microsoft has their MBSA.\n\n1406\n01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:24,061\nTheir make, Microsoft baseline security\nanalyzer that would be good for\n\n1407\n01:14:24,061 --> 01:14:26,090\nscanning Microsoft-based systems.\n\n1408\n01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:26,910\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1409\n01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:27,610\nAbsolutely.\n\n1410\n01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,370\nThere's lots of options.\n\n1411\n01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:33,980\nKnow what the capabilities of\nthose vulnerability scanners are.\n\n1412\n01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:40,100\nKnow what they offer you, and choose\nthe appropriate one, the Microsoft one.\n\n1413\n01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:44,432\nIts a good one to deal specifically with\nMicrosoft systems, but even in Microsoft\n\n1414\n01:14:44,432 --> 01:14:48,136\nsystems, you need to understand it\nonly does the operation system and\n\n1415\n01:14:48,136 --> 01:14:49,610\nthe office applications.\n\n1416\n01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:53,855\nIf you're not one of those two\nin the Microsoft ecosystem,\n\n1417\n01:14:53,855 --> 01:14:55,182\nit's not going to get you.\n\n1418\n01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:58,515\nIts gonna leave you off the map so\n\n1419\n01:14:58,515 --> 01:15:03,840\n[COUGH] just keep that in mind when you're\nevaluating these vulnerability scanners.\n\n1420\n01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:07,010\n>> What was that one?\n\n1421\n01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:08,080\nOh, is that Nexpose?\n\n1422\n01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,600\nThere you go Mike, thank you.\n\n1423\n01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:15,510\nNexpose was the one that ties\ninto that metasplit database.\n\n1424\n01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,530\n>> I see a question up here.\n\n1425\n01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,756\nIt says would you use something\nthat's more for the internet side or\n\n1426\n01:15:19,756 --> 01:15:21,460\nthe intranet side of your network?\n\n1427\n01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,955\nSo internal versus external.\n\n1428\n01:15:22,955 --> 01:15:24,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1429\n01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:25,380\n>> Both.\n\n1430\n01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:29,640\nI can't say use it more here or here.\n\n1431\n01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,580\nThe answer is which one,\nuse it on one side or the other.\n\n1432\n01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:33,895\nThe answer is yes, use it on both.\n\n1433\n01:15:33,895 --> 01:15:36,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's just what are you\n\n1434\n01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:37,380\ntrying to accomplish?\n\n1435\n01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:39,180\n>> Right.\n>> You choose the situation and\n\n1436\n01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:40,730\nyou do the scan.\n\n1437\n01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:45,380\n>> So if that machine is public facing and\nhas a public IP address and I'm outside,\n\n1438\n01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:48,110\nwell I might be able\nto scan it from there.\n\n1439\n01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,260\nIf I've made my way into the network, like\nwhen we get further on into our attack\n\n1440\n01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:54,630\nphase, or our hacking process, maybe\nyou've already made it in or you've got\n\n1441\n01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:58,480\na back door into your network and to\nsome target network or your pen testing.\n\n1442\n01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,290\nThen maybe you run from the inside there.\n\n1443\n01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,790\nOr if you're the security team for\nan IT department,\n\n1444\n01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:05,520\nyou run it inside your network so\nit really could be used either way.\n\n1445\n01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,300\n>> Yeah, I've used it for\nboth professionally.\n\n1446\n01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,090\nI've absolutely used it for that.\n\n1447\n01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:11,790\nI've used it for\ndoing external, internal scans.\n\n1448\n01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:12,610\nIt just all depends.\n\n1449\n01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:18,180\n>> All right, well anything else\nwe wanna throw into scanning?\n\n1450\n01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:21,598\n>> Well, when you're talking about\nscanning we should really kinda just\n\n1451\n01:16:21,598 --> 01:16:26,580\nquickly talk about what you're\ngonna be taking out of this phase.\n\n1452\n01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:30,640\nJust really quickly what you're taking\nout of this phase is you are taking out\n\n1453\n01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,401\ninformation on what ports you found open,\nwhat machine, or what IP addresses were\n\n1454\n01:16:35,401 --> 01:16:37,830\nlive, cuz we got those all the way\nback in the footprinting phase.\n\n1455\n01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:40,010\nSo, now we're finding\nout which ones are live,\n\n1456\n01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:42,720\nwhat ports are open on those systems.\n\n1457\n01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,070\nWe are finding maybe\na list of vulnerabilities,\n\n1458\n01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:47,420\nmaybe we have a map of the network.\n\n1459\n01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:50,600\nSo, we collected quite\na bit of information\n\n1460\n01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:52,410\nthrough all these various things.\n\n1461\n01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,430\nYou should be doing\na double check of all that,\n\n1462\n01:16:54,430 --> 01:16:57,900\nsee if there's anything else you\nneed to kind of fill out, and\n\n1463\n01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:04,010\nthen getting ready to carry that on to the\nenumeration section of the scanning phase.\n\n1464\n01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:04,530\n>> Right.\nVery good, yes.\n\n1465\n01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:08,240\nWe've got our deliverables, our stuff\nthat's coming out of the previous phase.\n\n1466\n01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,060\nThat's gonna be the input,\nand then in the next phase,\n\n1467\n01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,200\nin our next phase after scanning, we've\ndone footprinting, we've done scanning.\n\n1468\n01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,320\nNext one is gonna be that enumeration for\nus.\n\n1469\n01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,520\nAnd another good question out there in\nthe chatroom before we kill this one.\n\n1470\n01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,300\nI think I saw something about\nare these scanners able to scan VMs.\n\n1471\n01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:28,130\nAnd absolutely, as Mike pointed out, the\none he just scanned was a virtual machine\n\n1472\n01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,270\nthat I was running that Kali Linux in.\n\n1473\n01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,360\nThe issue you might run into\nthe scanning of virtual machines for\n\n1474\n01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,660\nvulnerabilities is there's some hardware\nvirtualization going on there and\n\n1475\n01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:43,360\nsome other things that could either be\nmasked from that it might not detect.\n\n1476\n01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,970\nIt doesn't realize it's a virtual machine.\n\n1477\n01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,340\nSo you might not get the most\naccurate results, maybe?\n\n1478\n01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,280\nWould you say that'd be correct?\n\n1479\n01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:52,812\n>> I think that's fair, yeah.\n\n1480\n01:17:52,812 --> 01:17:56,070\n>> All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that is gonna do it for\n\n1481\n01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:58,600\nour scanning chapter.\n\n1482\n01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,760\nRemember this was a part two of scanning.\n\n1483\n01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:03,480\nWe've got the part one episode\nthat we recorded earlier.\n\n1484\n01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:06,780\nMake sure you go back and watch that.\n\n1485\n01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,920\nYou know, as always,\nif you guys have any questions.\n\n1486\n01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:12,180\nWell let me tell you what we covered\nin here in the second phase.\n\n1487\n01:18:12,180 --> 01:18:15,815\nWe are the second, part two,\nI can't get it out of my mouth today.\n\n1488\n01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:18,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Part two of our scanning episode,\n\n1489\n01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:20,260\nwe covered things like EnMAP.\n\n1490\n01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,910\nWe got a really good look at all\nthe things we can do with EnMAP.\n\n1491\n01:18:23,910 --> 01:18:25,700\nWe talked about mapping out a network,\n\n1492\n01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:29,960\nusing programs like Friendly Pinger and\nSolarWinds.\n\n1493\n01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,630\nWe mentioned a couple other ones.\n\n1494\n01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:35,200\nAnd then we rounded it off with\na look at vulnerability scanners.\n\n1495\n01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,430\nI showed you guys a demo\nof using Nessus out there,\n\n1496\n01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:41,680\ntalked about a few one of those and then\nwhat we need to bring out of this phase.\n\n1497\n01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,450\nSo remember, if you've got questions\nwhile you're watching this show,\n\n1498\n01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:46,640\njump into the chat room and\nask your questions.\n\n1499\n01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,020\nThat's why that's what we do.\n\n1500\n01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:51,570\nThat's why we're here, to answer\nthe questions that you guys have.\n\n1501\n01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:54,620\nIf you're watching a recording of\nthis episode, you're not left out.\n\n1502\n01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,580\nUp at the top of every page is a Q&A link.\n\n1503\n01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:58,820\nAll you gotta do is click on that link,\n\n1504\n01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,790\nthat'll take you over to our forums\nwhere you can post your questions there.\n\n1505\n01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:05,990\nAll the hosts here monitor that, and we'll\nget the information you need out to you.\n\n1506\n01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,630\nSo again, thanks for\neverybody for tuning in.\n\n1507\n01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:11,630\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike

another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,430\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,660\nHow you doing today Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,850\n>> I'm doing awesome.\n\n7\n00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,610\n>> Awesome, I like to hear it.\n\n8\n00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:49,290\nAnother exciting episode for\neverybody out there in TV land.\n\n9\n00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,740\nWe've been doing our\n\n10\n00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,350\nCEH study guide written by none\nother than Mr.Sean Oriyano.\n\n11\n00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,140\nAnd we are getting ready to move on\ninto chapter six, which is enumeration.\n\n12\n00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,730\nWe've gone through the different phases\nof the hacking lifecycle, if you will.\n\n13\n00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,070\nWe've done our footprinting,\n\n14\n00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,725\nwe've done our scanning, and\nthe next phase is going to be enumeration.\n\n15\n00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:13,195\nBig fancy term, Sean,\n\n16\n00:01:13,195 --> 00:01:18,175\nfor listing or ordered lists or\nnaming one thing after another.\n\n17\n00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:19,605\nYou see all kinds of definitions for\nit, but\n\n18\n00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,590\nit really is just\nobtaining a list of things.\n\n19\n00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,500\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n20\n00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:30,590\nI mean, that's what you gave is basically\nthe dictionary, textbook definition of it.\n\n21\n00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,945\n>> That's where I got it from.\n\n22\n00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:33,436\n[LAUGH]\n>> Good.\n\n23\n00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:34,121\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n24\n00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:36,559\n>> Cuz that's where I plagiarized\nit from in that book.\n\n25\n00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:41,580\nNo, [LAUGH] in seriousness,\nit's fits it pretty nicely.\n\n26\n00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,540\nThat's a nice, succinct description when\nyou talk about what enumeration does.\n\n27\n00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,820\nYeah, you're gaining lists of things.\n\n28\n00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,910\nSo when we talk about doing enumeration,\nwe are trying to gain lists of different\n\n29\n00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,890\nthings on that network, or\non that target, whatever it might be.\n\n30\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,170\nSo, before we even get into that though,\nwe kinda need to gather the information.\n\n31\n00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,224\nAnd I think we kinda need to discuss\njust what type of information you can\n\n32\n00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:17,545\nreasonably expect to get out of a system\nor target when you're doing this.\n\n33\n00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:18,545\n>> Right.\n\n34\n00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:22,628\n>> And it's actually pretty amazing when\nyou think about it, what you can get.\n\n35\n00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:27,160\nIf we kind of fit this into what we talked\nout in our previous step with scanning.\n\n36\n00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,830\nScanning, as I said repeatedly,\n\n37\n00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,100\nit's like turning the doorknobs,\nseeing which ones are open.\n\n38\n00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,210\nAnd kind of just, maybe in some\ncase when you find some open,\n\n39\n00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:43,255\nlooking behind it to see what's back\nthere in that room, so to speak.\n\n40\n00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:46,003\nAnd you gotta remember\nwhen you do scanning,\n\n41\n00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:51,220\nscanning you're finding stuff that's\nopen or closed, you're determining that.\n\n42\n00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,110\nNow what we're doing is we're seeing is\nthere anything back there we can actually\n\n43\n00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,540\ndo anything with and\nwhat could we do with it?\n\n44\n00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,330\n>> Yeah and\nwe've mentioned that a few times,\n\n45\n00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,400\nyou'll see that common theme, right.\n\n46\n00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,920\nThe data that we gather in a previous\nphase is gonna be used in that next phase.\n\n47\n00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,960\nSo now that we know what ports are open,\nlet's go dive through them.\n\n48\n00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,320\nLet's see what kind of\ninformation lies back there and\n\n49\n00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,690\nlet's start listing this information out.\n\n50\n00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,670\n>> Yeah, absolutely, I mean,\nthat's what we're trying to do.\n\n51\n00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,790\nWe're trying to list information\nby going through and\n\n52\n00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,610\nlooking at these various ports and\nenumerating,\n\n53\n00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,780\nthere's that word again, each one of\nthose services to see what they reveal.\n\n54\n00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,040\nSo what could you expect at this stage,\nreasonably expect?\n\n55\n00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,779\nUsernames, of course,\nyou could definitely get usernames.\n\n56\n00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:37,600\nYou might be able to obtain passwords.\n\n57\n00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,060\nYou might be able to obtain\ninformation about system policy.\n\n58\n00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,340\nThat's more than possible.\n\n59\n00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,050\nYou could get stuff through SNMP, and\n\n60\n00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,500\nwe'll talk about what that is so if it's\nan alphabet soup right now, that's fine.\n\n61\n00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,980\nYou might be able to\nget stuff through that.\n\n62\n00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,556\nYou can get lists of machines,\nlists of shares,\n\n63\n00:04:01,556 --> 00:04:05,760\ngroups, all sorts of interesting things.\n\n64\n00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,610\nYou're really digging\ninto it at this point.\n\n65\n00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,480\nNow, keep in mind,\nwe haven't really hacked the system.\n\n66\n00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,210\nIt's kind of crazy when you look at it,\nthe amount of information you get,\n\n67\n00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,530\nwe're still not saying\nwe've hacked the system.\n\n68\n00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,560\nWe're getting close.\n\n69\n00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,030\nRemember that is the next phase.\n\n70\n00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,032\nWe're not in the next phase yet.\n\n71\n00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:30,223\nWe are still in the scanning\nphase of hacking.\n\n72\n00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:33,924\nBut there's, and when we look at\nthe scanning phase, we have scanning and\n\n73\n00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:37,120\nthen we have enumeration underneath,\nthose are two subtypes.\n\n74\n00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,350\nSo we've just moved into\nthe second half of scanning.\n\n75\n00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,548\n>> That's the stuff that's being exposed\neither through normal processes.\n\n76\n00:04:45,548 --> 00:04:49,620\nWe haven't used anything\nto break anything or\n\n77\n00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,350\njust to tag, like for\nexample, we scan open ports.\n\n78\n00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,940\nWe find a port that's open, and\nit probably should be open for\n\n79\n00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,780\nsome reason or other,\n\n80\n00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,190\nit's providing a particular service, and\nwe're just taking advantage of that.\n\n81\n00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,410\nAnd we're leveraging that in a way that\nmaybe they didn't intend us to do.\n\n82\n00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,211\nBut we're really not breaking anything yet\nor as far as the hacking concept goes.\n\n83\n00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:12,030\n>> Yeah and\nthat's an important thing is that we're\n\n84\n00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,518\nreally not breaking\nanything at this point.\n\n85\n00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:18,530\nThe information that's offered here is\ninformation that's supposed to be offered\n\n86\n00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,390\nfor various reasons.\n\n87\n00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:25,590\nLists of user names may be offered for\nsome sort of software functionality.\n\n88\n00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,459\nLists of shares may be offered because of\nsomething that the network has to have\n\n89\n00:05:30,459 --> 00:05:31,137\nrunning.\n\n90\n00:05:31,137 --> 00:05:37,775\nIt may need to enumerate the shares that\nare available on a system to attach to it.\n\n91\n00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:41,025\nIt could definitely be\nsomething like that.\n\n92\n00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:46,725\nSome of this stuff is done,\nsome of the stuff we already enumerated is\n\n93\n00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:52,485\nrequired for that network to function\nthe way it needs to function.\n\n94\n00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:57,750\nSome of this stuff also, interestingly\nenough, is easy to enumerate because\n\n95\n00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,830\nat one point in the past it was necessary\nto have that and no one shut that off.\n\n96\n00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,211\nYou know,\nNetBIOS I'm looking your direction.\n\n97\n00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:06,800\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n98\n00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,470\n>> So\nthat's something that a lot of devices,\n\n99\n00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,590\nin the Microsoft world especially,\nthey have that enabled, but\n\n100\n00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,370\nthere's really not a good reason for\nit in a lot of cases to have that enabled.\n\n101\n00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,070\nIt's just something that was enabled for\nlegacy support and\n\n102\n00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,530\nit's up to you to kind of turn it off.\n\n103\n00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,559\nAnd one of the things we talked about\nearlier in this whole course was that\n\n104\n00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:33,754\nit's, ideally we'd like to have a system\nthat everything is shut down and\n\n105\n00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,420\nwe turn on the things that we need.\n\n106\n00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,771\nThat goes towards like least privilege,\nthat concept as well, and need to know,\n\n107\n00:06:40,771 --> 00:06:42,080\nstuff like that.\n\n108\n00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,290\nLock it down.\n\n109\n00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,098\nAnd then whatever you don't need, or\nwhatever you do need, turn it on.\n\n110\n00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:51,730\nBut that's not, Microsoft has\nkind of learned that lesson, but\n\n111\n00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,450\nit's not 100% across the board and\nI'm picking on Microsoft,\n\n112\n00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,150\nthey're not the only one that does that.\n\n113\n00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,220\nEvery vendor does that\nto a certain degree.\n\n114\n00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,000\nI'm just talking NetBIOS in the Microsoft\nworld and Microsoft turns it on.\n\n115\n00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,810\nThe reason why they leave something\nlike that on is because they figure you\n\n116\n00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,750\nmight have older clients and\n\n117\n00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,530\nthey wanna leave that on so\nyou can be compatible with them.\n\n118\n00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,690\nBut the reality is most\nof us don't need it.\n\n119\n00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,930\nSo remember that.\n\n120\n00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,690\nWe'll talk more about NetBIOS in a bit,\n\n121\n00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,610\nbut do remember that is that some of\nthis stuff is just legacy stuff that\n\n122\n00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:31,220\nwas left on which may leave the door open\nenough for us to get in and check things.\n\n123\n00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,830\n>> Absolutely, yeah.\n\n124\n00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,376\nMicrosoft has always been\nreally good about, I think,\n\n125\n00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:39,210\nproviding that backwards compatibility,\nnot forcing us to upgrade\n\n126\n00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,180\neverything all at once,\ngiving us the ability to migrate slowly.\n\n127\n00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,705\nBut that does open the door for\nvulnerabilities because the newer stuff\n\n128\n00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:50,064\nis patched up against it, but\nthe older stuff still relies on that.\n\n129\n00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:54,518\nYeah, I think NetBIOS, I've been saying\nit's been going away since, I don't know,\n\n130\n00:07:54,518 --> 00:07:55,431\n2003 maybe.\n\n131\n00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,777\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And Windows XP and here it is 2015, and\n\n132\n00:07:58,777 --> 00:08:00,915\nit's Still hanging around.\n\n133\n00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:04,393\nAlthough, I think it's on it's last leg,\nfinally with 2012.\n\n134\n00:08:04,393 --> 00:08:06,180\nBut I say that, it'll be in 2014.\n\n135\n00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,545\n>> Yeah, I don't know if I even wanna go\nthat far and say, it's finally going away.\n\n136\n00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:14,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's almost like\n\n137\n00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,410\nthe super villains in these comic books.\n\n138\n00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:20,052\nOh The Green Goblin has been,\nSpiderman finally got him and\n\n139\n00:08:20,052 --> 00:08:21,800\nits like ten issues later he's back.\n\n140\n00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,180\nWhat?\nNo one stays dead in comic books,\n\n141\n00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,920\nno one stays dead, nothing really\ngoes away in the computer world.\n\n142\n00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,420\nSo it kinda seems like that sometimes.\n\n143\n00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,010\nYou know, we've heard what,\nwins has been going away forever?\n\n144\n00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it's still there.\n\n145\n00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,370\n>> It's still a role I\ncan install in 2012 R2.\n\n146\n00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,660\n>> Yeah, it's absolutely still there,\n\n147\n00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,730\nand how many times have you\ntaught a class yourself and.\n\n148\n00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,900\nAsked if I do this whenever\nwhenever WINS comes up.\n\n149\n00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,080\nAsk people do you use\nWINS on your network?\n\n150\n00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,300\nYeah.\nWe still have it out there.\n\n151\n00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,244\nDo you know why?\n\n152\n00:08:58,244 --> 00:08:59,560\n>> No I didn't\n>> No.\n\n153\n00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,470\nIt was just there when they came in and\n\n154\n00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,580\nno one wants to shut it off\ncuz they're kind of worried.\n\n155\n00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,220\nThey're like, it's there.\n\n156\n00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,550\nThere's gotta be a reason that it's there,\nright?\n\n157\n00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,120\n>> Right?\n\n158\n00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,950\n>> So\nthey just leave it hanging out you know?\n\n159\n00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,040\nAnd that is a pen testers\ndream to find that,\n\n160\n00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,250\nbecause it's leaving a big door open for\nyou.\n\n161\n00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,840\nIt's a hackers dream to find that as well.\n\n162\n00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,400\nSo, we kind of wanna ask questions,\nin my pen tester experience for example,\n\n163\n00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,580\nif I find winds or I will, you know, ask\nquestions, why is it there, I don't know.\n\n164\n00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,030\nThat's unacceptable to me.\n\n165\n00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,460\nIf you say I don't know, find out.\n\n166\n00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,000\nIt may be kind of harsh\nto say it to a client or\n\n167\n00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,830\nsomething, why's he ordering me around.\n\n168\n00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,260\nThat's what you brought me in for.\n\n169\n00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,130\nFind out, find me a reason So why it is\n\n170\n00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,091\nI'm just gonna do it the easy way unplug\nit and wait till someone complains.\n\n171\n00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:52,972\n>> It's not a bad option right?\n\n172\n00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:53,570\n>> It works.\n\n173\n00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,612\nit gets the job done.\n\n174\n00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:56,470\n>> Exactly.\nYou know and nobody calls and\n\n175\n00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,970\nthey never even noticed you turn it off.\n\n176\n00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,652\nThere's no problem and\njust leave that thing off.\n\n177\n00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:02,275\n>> I think I found out why I\ndon't work full time for anybody.\n\n178\n00:10:02,275 --> 00:10:04,230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'd just go and start unplugging stuff.\n\n179\n00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,950\nI'm like look at this, kick this over.\n\n180\n00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,198\nWhat?\nCause' I'd be fired for that nonsense.\n\n181\n00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:12,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n182\n00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,090\nwe've got a lot of things that we\ncan use enumeration to list out.\n\n183\n00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,930\nWe talked about usernames and\ngroups, and computer names.\n\n184\n00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,220\nSo where do we start?\n\n185\n00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,020\nWhere do you wanna start\nwith our enumeration?\n\n186\n00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,110\n>> There's plenty of places to start,\namazingly enough.\n\n187\n00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,610\nIt's like a kid in a candy store, really.\n\n188\n00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,210\nYeah, you can start in so\nmany different places, so\n\n189\n00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,780\nfirst let's kind of enumerate\nthe different places we can start at.\n\n190\n00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,360\nSee if kinda slip in the buzzword.\n\n191\n00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,910\n>> Nice.\n\n192\n00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,040\n>> Yeah, so before we get in the details\nof each, let's kinda talk about some of\n\n193\n00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,250\nthe different options we're\ngonna talk about in here.\n\n194\n00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,560\nYou could definitely add on\nto this list and find more.\n\n195\n00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,080\nThis is just kind of a starter list for\nyou.\n\n196\n00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,980\nOne of the places we can start,\nfor example, is NetBIOS.\n\n197\n00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,635\nNetBIOS has been around for a long time.\n\n198\n00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:07,900\n>> Mm-hm\n>> What?\n\n199\n00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,660\nBeen around since what?\n\n200\n00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,860\nWindows for work groups or before that?\n\n201\n00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,660\n>> Oh yeah at least since 311 for\nwork groups.\n\n202\n00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,630\nIt's an old naming resolution protocol\nback in the day when networks weren't all\n\n203\n00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,310\nthat big.\n\n204\n00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,280\nWe didn't have the internet that we know\ntoday and it's got it's limitations.\n\n205\n00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,930\nIt served it's purpose then.\n\n206\n00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,980\nRight?\nBut it was a noisy protocol,\n\n207\n00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,630\nit relied on broadcast.\n\n208\n00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,835\nIf you weren't using a WIN server,\nwhich we didn't have initially,\n\n209\n00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:30,540\n>> Mm-hm\n\n210\n00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,300\n>> It was limited to 15 characters.\n\n211\n00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,890\nYou had 16 characters but one of\nthe characters is reserved to denote\n\n212\n00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,950\nthe service that the node is offering.\n\n213\n00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,090\nSo now, we're down to 15 characters.\n\n214\n00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,340\nIt's not routable.\n\n215\n00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,400\nBut it's still out there because some of\nthe older operating systems still used it.\n\n216\n00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,750\nWindow's 98 was heavy into it,\n\n217\n00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:54,340\nWindow's XP still used it a little bit, as\nfar as on the Window's side of things go.\n\n218\n00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,120\nWhat else?\n\n219\n00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,050\nRemember the old network neighborhood and\nthings like that?\n\n220\n00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,100\n>> My God.\nYes, [LAUGH]\n\n221\n00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,870\n>> Relied on that stuff.\n\n222\n00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,560\nBut for the most part, we don't need it\nanymore, right, because we've got DNS.\n\n223\n00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,860\nAnd DNS is our scalable\nsolution that all networks use,\n\n224\n00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,190\nthat the internet uses and Windows now\n\n225\n00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:16,750\nwe've got something called link local\nmulticast name resolution protocol.\n\n226\n00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,242\nWhich is good for\nresolving local names on an Internal LAN.\n\n227\n00:12:20,242 --> 00:12:24,955\n>> Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] .They've\nreplaced it with better stuff.\n\n228\n00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:25,910\n>> Mm-hm\n>> And\n\n229\n00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,600\nit's not to say that you're never\ngonna find a reason to use that.\n\n230\n00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,395\nThere's always some somebody,\nseems to be somebody using it, whether,\n\n231\n00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:38,065\nyou know it's just the fact\nthat it's Legacy or\n\n232\n00:12:38,065 --> 00:12:42,075\nit's someone that's built something new\nand is a major offender there because they\n\n233\n00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,115\ndecide to use that when there's\nbetter stuff available.\n\n234\n00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:51,830\nSo we see that thing out there but\nthat's one thing you can enumerate.\n\n235\n00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,620\nIt's very chatty.\n\n236\n00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,250\nAs you mentioned.\n\n237\n00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,140\nIt's a very chatty protocol.\n\n238\n00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,840\nSo you can enumerate stuff out of it\npretty easily and find out if it's there.\n\n239\n00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,430\n>> And being that older protocol.\n\n240\n00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,020\nIt's security again was not a core\nconcept when NetBIOS was developed.\n\n241\n00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,630\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n242\n00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,970\nI think you bring a good\npoint with that protocol or\n\n243\n00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,620\nany of the things we're gonna\ntalk about in here really.\n\n244\n00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,940\nThey're used to all these things that\nwere enumerated are basically gonna be\n\n245\n00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,090\nnetwork services that\nare exposed on a system.\n\n246\n00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,950\nAnd if you look at the core thing,\nwith the core concept behind networks,\n\n247\n00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,190\nnetworks are not.\n\n248\n00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,150\nPut are not deployed to limit\nthe share of information.\n\n249\n00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,190\nThey are deployed to share information.\n\n250\n00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,440\nSo we deploy it to share information,\n\n251\n00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,710\nthen we go through and turn stuff off and\nconfigure it to control it a bit better.\n\n252\n00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,250\nBut that was the reason\ninternet was developed.\n\n253\n00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,190\nThat's the reason networks\nthemselves are developed,\n\n254\n00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,800\nwas to share information or resources.\n\n255\n00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,970\nAnd so, we are just relying\non that to do our numeration,\n\n256\n00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,340\nplus other things we're\ngonna see later on.\n\n257\n00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,160\nThey lend themselves very\nwell to certain things.\n\n258\n00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,780\n>> They do, they do.\n\n259\n00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,300\nAll right, so you wanna dive\nthrough some more of these guys?\n\n260\n00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,710\n>> Yeah.\n>> You wanna take a peak at what we can do\n\n261\n00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,660\nwith that BIOS?\n\n262\n00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,760\n>> Let's talk about the list and\nthen we'll dive in each one, I think,\n\n263\n00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,780\nto give each one their kind of their.\n\n264\n00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,555\nTheir initial introduction here.\n\n265\n00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:16,600\n>> Okay\n>> Another one, SNMP, just to kind of give\n\n266\n00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,510\nyou the other quick overview of that,\nSNMP, Simple Network Management Protocol.\n\n267\n00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,740\nit's designed to send and\nreceive messages to network devices.\n\n268\n00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:32,560\nIt relies on a combination of strings\nto either read information of device or\n\n269\n00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,050\nsend it to a device.\n\n270\n00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,490\nIt is a network manager protocol,\n\n271\n00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,510\nit says right in the name, and as such\nit carries some very vital information,\n\n272\n00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:46,200\nand it is present on a lot of networks,\nespecially enterprise networks\n\n273\n00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,280\nwhich you very well could reside\non right now and have test.\n\n274\n00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,375\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So that's SNMP.\n\n275\n00:14:54,375 --> 00:15:00,950\nWe also have LDAP which probably a lot\nof you that are familiar with it.\n\n276\n00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,460\nYou know, already, either directly or\nindirectly, it is definitely\n\n277\n00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,840\nsomething that there's a lot of exposure\non it, mainly because, we both know.\n\n278\n00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,320\n>> Yeah.\n>> Active directory yet uses it.\n\n279\n00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,070\nThere's a lot of active directory\ndeployments out there on networks.\n\n280\n00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,190\nLDAP is an integral part\nof those deployments.\n\n281\n00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,985\nNot to mention this other stuff that plugs\nin like Exchange and stuff like that.\n\n282\n00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:26,560\n>> Right\n>> Now,\n\n283\n00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,840\nMicrosoft isn't the only\none that uses LDAP.\n\n284\n00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:33,510\nIn fact, LDAP is a standard and\nit wasn't invented by Microsoft.\n\n285\n00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,840\nThey just happen to use it\nin active directory and\n\n286\n00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,510\nthere's other directory\nservices that use it too.\n\n287\n00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:44,730\nFor example, OpenLDAP, Open Directory,\neDirectory from Novell.\n\n288\n00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,460\nThere's a lot of them out there.\n\n289\n00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,850\nIn fact, Sun, or Oracle, whatever they're\ncalling the directory service now.\n\n290\n00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,850\nThey even have one of these.\n\n291\n00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,490\nJust LDAP.\n\n292\n00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:54,179\n>> Mm-hm\n>> So, it's not just restricted to it.\n\n293\n00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:58,686\nSo, there's a lot of deployments\nthat include LDAP out there.\n\n294\n00:15:58,686 --> 00:16:01,008\nAnd that's not even including\nthe messaging services that use it.\n\n295\n00:16:01,008 --> 00:16:02,843\nIt's a universal thing.\n\n296\n00:16:02,843 --> 00:16:06,675\nSo you could use that to\ninteract with those services and\n\n297\n00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:12,170\nif you think about it, let's just\ntake the mail services off the table.\n\n298\n00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,400\nThink about what I just told you.\n\n299\n00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,740\nIt's something that's being used to\ninteract with a directory service.\n\n300\n00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,162\nIf you work with active directory, you\nalready kinda know how vital that is, and\n\n301\n00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:25,999\nI am just kind of dancing around\nthe fringes using that to talk to active\n\n302\n00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,280\ndirectory and find out what's in it.\n\n303\n00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,390\nThat's getting pretty serious right there.\n\n304\n00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,522\n>> Yeah, in a Windows environment\nobviously the active directory database\n\n305\n00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:37,701\nwhere all my user accounts and my computer\naccounts and all of my objects for\n\n306\n00:16:37,701 --> 00:16:40,660\nthat matter, groups and\nthings like that are stored.\n\n307\n00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,550\nTheir passwords are stored in there.\n\n308\n00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,020\nJust in case you are unfamiliar,\n\n309\n00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,990\nLDAP being\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol.\n\n310\n00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,650\nSo it's what we're using to query and to\ntalk to, in this case, an active directory\n\n311\n00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,745\ndatabase but, any database that's\nwhat they call LDAP compliant.\n\n312\n00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:56,650\n>> Thanks for explaining that acronym.\n\n313\n00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,330\nI realized that I forgot that.\n\n314\n00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,690\nI was like [SOUND], LDAP.\n\n315\n00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,313\nCome on.\n\n316\n00:17:01,313 --> 00:17:02,187\nYou must know it.\n\n317\n00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:02,811\nLook it up.\n\n318\n00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:03,693\nThat's what Google's for.\n\n319\n00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:06,185\nI aint got time for this type of stuff.\n\n320\n00:17:06,185 --> 00:17:11,225\n>> [LAUGH] So we got LDAP and then NTP.\n\n321\n00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:12,660\n>> NTP is interesting.\n\n322\n00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,820\nNetwork Time Protocol.\n\n323\n00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:19,200\nUsed to synchronize clocks on clients and\nservers on a network.\n\n324\n00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,420\n>> This seems harmless,\nwhat can I do with NTP?\n\n325\n00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,210\n>> Ever seems harmless until\nwe use it against you.\n\n326\n00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:23,970\nRight?\n\n327\n00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,750\n>> Right.\n\n328\n00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,210\n>> NTP is one of those things.\n\n329\n00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,460\nThere's not really much more\nto say about it really.\n\n330\n00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,090\nIt synchronizes clocks in a network.\n\n331\n00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,320\nThat's it.\n\n332\n00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,030\nIt sounds like what can you do with that?\n\n333\n00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,205\nMake someone get up for\nwork early or too late?\n\n334\n00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:42,310\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n335\n00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,670\nYou're late for\nyour meeting and you get fired.\n\n336\n00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,737\n>> And you're like, ha ha.\n\n337\n00:17:45,737 --> 00:17:46,985\nSocial engineering.\n\n338\n00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:47,685\nHa ha!\n\n339\n00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:48,434\nGot you fired.\n\n340\n00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But, no.\n\n341\n00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,620\nThere's more that you can\ndo with that to be sure.\n\n342\n00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:59,000\nNTP plays a big role in a lot of networks,\na very integral role.\n\n343\n00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,600\nSome of you may already know from your\nexperience with directory services, for\n\n344\n00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,920\nexample, those do rely on NTP, or\nspecifically of synchronized clocks.\n\n345\n00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,670\nSo, it's a very big, important thing.\n\n346\n00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:16,640\nSo, we're gonna talk about how\nthat can be exploited to gain\n\n347\n00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,600\ninformation about a network, and probably\na good number of you would be shocked.\n\n348\n00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,140\nIt's usually one of those\nthings people look at and\n\n349\n00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:25,170\nsay whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, what?\n\n350\n00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,606\nI'm gonna show you that.\n\n351\n00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:29,435\n>> There's your cliffhanger.\n\n352\n00:18:29,435 --> 00:18:30,901\nEverybody stay tuned for that one.\n\n353\n00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,457\n[LAUGH]\n>> Coming next week,\n\n354\n00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:37,035\nnext episode\n>> SMTP?\n\n355\n00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:39,939\n>> Yeah, SMTP is another really good one.\n\n356\n00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:44,530\nIt's a Simple Message Transport Protocol.\n\n357\n00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,218\nDid I get that right?\n\n358\n00:18:45,218 --> 00:18:45,979\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay.\n\n359\n00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:47,350\n[LAUGH]\n>> Simple mail, yeah,\n\n360\n00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,480\nsimple mail organization.\n\n361\n00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,250\n>> Simple mail message.\n\n362\n00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,190\nWork with me.\n\n363\n00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,000\nJust work with me out there, people.\n\n364\n00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,245\nJust nod and say I'm right.\n\n365\n00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:55,465\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so.\n\n366\n00:18:55,465 --> 00:18:59,700\n[LAUGH] SMTP is,\nwe're familiar with it for\n\n367\n00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,830\nsending messages from one system to\nanother, so for email and stuff like that.\n\n368\n00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:07,481\nBut there's other places that it is used.\n\n369\n00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:11,270\nI mean, Active Directory does use it for\ninner site stuff.\n\n370\n00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,313\n>> Don't you ever, but\nyou could, yes it is supported.\n\n371\n00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:17,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah I'm not recommending it,\n\n372\n00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,710\nMike's not recommending it.\n\n373\n00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,240\n>> Yeah, no.\n>> We're just saying that it is supported,\n\n374\n00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,577\nwhich means somewhere out\nthere someone's doing it.\n\n375\n00:19:24,577 --> 00:19:29,560\n>> [LAUGH] SMTP is a what\na connection list delivery, right?\n\n376\n00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,290\nSo if you need that type of\ndelivery method SMTP will work.\n\n377\n00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,460\nOkay, so it can be multipurpose for\nother things other than just mail.\n\n378\n00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,280\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n379\n00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,420\nFor us, there's some fascinating\nthings you can do with it.\n\n380\n00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,000\nSome really fascinating things.\n\n381\n00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,720\nAnd I think you'll be, I don't want to say\npleasantly surprised, but I'll say that\n\n382\n00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,500\nyou probably will be surprised when you\nhear the type of stuff you can do with it.\n\n383\n00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,810\n>> And then DNS.\n\n384\n00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,490\n>> Oh yeah, our old friend DNS.\n\n385\n00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,790\nDNS, there's a lot of stuff\nyou can enumerate from it.\n\n386\n00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,450\nYou think of DNS, we know what it does.\n\n387\n00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,860\nIt does forward and reverse lookups of\nnames or IPs, as the case may be, so\n\n388\n00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,830\nit's a very powerful and\nit's a very integral service to a network.\n\n389\n00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,460\nSo when we look at that service and\nwe know what it does.\n\n390\n00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,480\nA DNS does what it does and\n\n391\n00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,700\ndoes it very well, but it really doesn't\nhave much In the way of security.\n\n392\n00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,680\nThey've had to graph security\nfeatures onto it over time so\n\n393\n00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,380\nsomeone over time has got a big roll of\nduct tape and duct tape the new bits and\n\n394\n00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,060\npieces of code to it to make it work,\nand that still works to our advantage\n\n395\n00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,860\ncuz there's little loop holes and\nstuff like that in it.\n\n396\n00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,440\nWe can even exploit the basic functioning\nof the protocol to get things out of it,\n\n397\n00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,890\nor service to get things out of it.\n\n398\n00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:57,810\n>> So lots of different places we\nare gonna look to find this information,\n\n399\n00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:00,120\nstart listing out the different\nthings that we want or\n\n400\n00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,230\ncan get access to on their network.\n\n401\n00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,660\n>> I would, I mean,\nif I can also add something else in here.\n\n402\n00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,460\nWhen you think of it, when you think\nabout these things at this point and\n\n403\n00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,630\nyou think about things like DNS and\nLDAP, just those two,\n\n404\n00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,390\nokay we've got DNS AND LDAP,\nI want you to start thinking big picture.\n\n405\n00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,570\nSomething that's gonna\nbe an integral skill for\n\n406\n00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,250\na pin tester is gonna be\nthinking big picture.\n\n407\n00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:31,060\nIf I asked you for example, what other\n\n408\n00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,400\nnetwork management service or what network\nmanagement service requires DNS to run?\n\n409\n00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,940\nYou should probably be pretty easily say,\n\n410\n00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,730\nyou know Active Directory\nis a prime example.\n\n411\n00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,210\nWithout DNS, Active Directory doesn't run.\n\n412\n00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,110\nSo that means you could\npotentially query DNS and\n\n413\n00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,340\nget information about active directory.\n\n414\n00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,390\nSame thing with LDAP.\n\n415\n00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:53,290\nLDAP I already told you where LDAP is,\n\n416\n00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,560\nyou could have a directory service\nsniffing around some place.\n\n417\n00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,460\nSo knowing that that's there and\nknowing what it's used for\n\n418\n00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,030\ncould give you insight into other things\nthat are existing on that network.\n\n419\n00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,360\nSo I want you to start thinking,\neven though I haven't stressed it yet,\n\n420\n00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,560\nI want you to start thinking big picture\nand how these things may be tied together.\n\n421\n00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,330\nI'm not going to directly\nmention directory service, and\n\n422\n00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,960\ngoing into it here in this particular\nepisode where we do enumeration, but\n\n423\n00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,120\nwhen we get into future phases of hacking\nthat's definitely going to come into play.\n\n424\n00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,340\nSo it's time for\nyou to start thinking what does this mean?\n\n425\n00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,010\nAnd I want everyone to start doing that.\n\n426\n00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,200\nSo anyway.\n\n427\n00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,610\n>> Yeah, focusing on the information\nwe're gonna get back is great,\n\n428\n00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,640\nbut what am I gonna do\nwith that information?\n\n429\n00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,870\nThat's where those intangibles come\ninto play that Sean mentioned in\n\n430\n00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,590\none of our very first episodes.\n\n431\n00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:51,255\nThose are the skills you need\nas a good penetration tester,\n\n432\n00:22:51,255 --> 00:22:54,731\nis to start thinking outside the box or\nstart thinking other ways I can use it.\n\n433\n00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:58,645\nThis is what it's designed to do,\nbut what if I used it this way?\n\n434\n00:22:58,645 --> 00:22:59,444\nWhat would happen?\n\n435\n00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,824\nWhat would that break,\n\n436\n00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:04,481\nor what could I get access to if\nI tweak it just a little bit, so.\n\n437\n00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:08,180\nAll right, so a lot of things that\nwe're going to be able to use to start\n\n438\n00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,870\nenumerating information out of a network.\n\n439\n00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,270\nTell you what.\nLooking at the clock,\n\n440\n00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,250\nit's about break time here, so\nthis might be a good point for us to stop.\n\n441\n00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:20,526\nWhen we come back, we can take\na look at doing some enumeration.\n\n442\n00:23:20,526 --> 00:23:23,568\nSo you guys stay tuned,\nwe'll be right back.\n\n443\n00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:29,354\n[SOUND] All right.\n\n444\n00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,101\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n445\n00:23:31,101 --> 00:23:33,770\nContinuing on with our enumeration phase.\n\n446\n00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,850\nWe talked a little bit about some\nof the different things that we can\n\n447\n00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,520\nexpect to get.\n\n448\n00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,440\nSome of the different protocols we might\ntake advantage of to do the enumeration\n\n449\n00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,090\nand little bit of high level\noverview of what we might get back.\n\n450\n00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,135\nAnd now, we're ready to take a look\nat what we can do with some of these.\n\n451\n00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,811\nYeah I think we've hit that\npoint where we can drill in and\n\n452\n00:23:51,811 --> 00:23:55,886\nstart seeing what some of these\nservices and protocols can do.\n\n453\n00:23:55,886 --> 00:24:01,920\nSo, let's start with NetBIOS, just to\nget that one knocked out of the way.\n\n454\n00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,880\nIt's probably one of the bigger\nones you're gonna have issues with\n\n455\n00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,030\nor encounter.\n\n456\n00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,210\nSo it's worthwhile tackling that first.\n\n457\n00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,580\nWell, in our first\nsegment of enumeration we\n\n458\n00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:20,520\ntalked a little bit about a net BIOS, and\nit's probably worthwhile just since we're\n\n459\n00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,780\ngonna be drilling into it, to kind of talk\na little bit more about what it is and\n\n460\n00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:30,460\nits history, why it's still there,\neven though we did discuss some of this,\n\n461\n00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,249\njust to make sure that\nwe're all on the same page.\n\n462\n00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,720\nNet buy offs is actually technically,\n\n463\n00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,590\nI believe most people classify it as\na service, if you really got down to it,\n\n464\n00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,820\nrather than it being a full\nblown network protocol.\n\n465\n00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,950\nIt's been around for quite a while, it's\nbeen around since least the early 90's and\n\n466\n00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,370\nit was, as you had said earlier,\nit was designed for small networks.\n\n467\n00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,800\nIt wasn't designed for\nthese large deployments.\n\n468\n00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:04,550\nIt's just very noisy, or very chatty\nas I like to say, it clogs up networks.\n\n469\n00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,870\nNetwork administrators do not like it for\nthe most part.\n\n470\n00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:14,280\nIt won't cross over things like routers\nand switches, that block broadcast.\n\n471\n00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,100\nSo, it's really quite limited.\n\n472\n00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,970\nThe reason why you still see it\nrunning is because some of these\n\n473\n00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,530\nolder products do still use it.\n\n474\n00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:27,810\nSome of those prompts are still in\nMicrosoft's family for example, and\n\n475\n00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:32,770\nMicrosoft has slowly been working to\nget those out of their product line.\n\n476\n00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,190\n>> And when he says slowly,\nhe means slowly [LAUGH].\n\n477\n00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,280\n>> If it was any slower a glacier\nwould hit their product team.\n\n478\n00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,430\n>> They're in no hurry.\n\n479\n00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,535\n>> Yeah.\n\n480\n00:25:41,535 --> 00:25:44,440\n[LAUGH]\n>> But it's definitely been around.\n\n481\n00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,820\nIt's probably going to be around for\nquite a long time.\n\n482\n00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,190\nThat's kind of the way I look at it.\n\n483\n00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,680\nMaybe it's a bit pessimistic.\n\n484\n00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,800\nBut I kind of feel that yeah,\nkind of going to be around for awhile.\n\n485\n00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,360\nIt's something that you're\ngoing to have to deal with.\n\n486\n00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:04,140\nOn current Windows systems it\nstill is enabled by default.\n\n487\n00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,330\nYou have to disable that.\n\n488\n00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:08,270\nSo they have net BIOS over TCP/IP.\n\n489\n00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,640\nIt's still there.\n\n490\n00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,310\nSo it means we can use it in our scans,\npotentially\n\n491\n00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:18,740\nuse it in our scans to enumerate systems\nand extract information from it.\n\n492\n00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,140\nNow, Microsoft has done\nsome things to prevent\n\n493\n00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,710\nthe misuse of protocol even if it is\nenabled, or I should say service.\n\n494\n00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:30,370\nI'll flip between service and\nprotocol from that bios\n\n495\n00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,730\neven though it's technically\na service I'll say one or the other.\n\n496\n00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:41,100\nBut Microsoft has taken\nsome step to make it safer.\n\n497\n00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,700\nAnd they've done a lot of those steps\nsince the Windows 2000 time-frame.\n\n498\n00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,540\nBut like I said,\nit's out there, still enabled.\n\n499\n00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,580\nAnd it's important to understand\nwhy they still have it enabled.\n\n500\n00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,170\nI remember when they first\nstart coming with server 2003.\n\n501\n00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,920\nThey were saying,\n\"well you can disable it'.\n\n502\n00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,450\nUnless you have stuff that\nspecifically needs it\", and\n\n503\n00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,945\nthen neglected to mention some of\nthe stuff that was built into-.\n\n504\n00:27:03,945 --> 00:27:05,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The Windows server needed it.\n\n505\n00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,870\n>> So if you want to continue\nto run our operating systems,\n\n506\n00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:09,590\nwe failed to mention that exactly.\n\n507\n00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,350\n>> So I don't know about you, but\nI remember people shutting it off and\n\n508\n00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,950\ngoing hey some of this stuff isn't\nworking, what the heck happened.\n\n509\n00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,820\nWell, you shut off NetBIOS, it's required.\n\n510\n00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,750\nSo there was that, and\n\n511\n00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,780\nthen they finally got the requirements for\nthe operating system.\n\n512\n00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,330\nTo use.\n\n513\n00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,450\nThey kinda addressed those, but\nit was still left on for default for\n\n514\n00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:37,900\nbackwards compatibility with 95 and 98,\nand ME clients, just to mention a few.\n\n515\n00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,030\nJust a little bit of trivia.\n\n516\n00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,575\nME is the most secure windows\noperating system ever.\n\n517\n00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,865\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cause you can't hack what never runs.\n\n518\n00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, anyway.\n\n519\n00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:47,260\n>> Good point.\n\n520\n00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,930\nGood point.\n\n521\n00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,910\n>> I'm just saying.\n\n522\n00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,975\n>> Mistake edition.\n\n523\n00:27:51,975 --> 00:27:52,938\n[LAUGH]\n>> Windows\n\n524\n00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,484\nmany errors is what that stands for.\n\n525\n00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:56,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For in case you're wondering.\n\n526\n00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,300\nSo they kept it on for\nbackwards compatibility.\n\n527\n00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:07,170\nAnd don't kid yourself by the way, there's\nstill a lot of people running '95 and\n\n528\n00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,220\n'98 systems which is kinda\nscary to a certain degree.\n\n529\n00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,090\nI remember working with a client\na couple years ago, and\n\n530\n00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,210\nI'm sure it's still this way but\n\n531\n00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:22,860\nthey're slowly fixing the situation\nwhere I had asked them some questions.\n\n532\n00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,290\nI said, what Windows clients do you have?\n\n533\n00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,480\nAnd they said all of them.\n\n534\n00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,260\nAnd, I said, I started joking around\nsaying, you mean like '95 and '98?\n\n535\n00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,410\nLike yeah, we've got some of those.\n\n536\n00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,200\nAnd I said next thing you're gonna tell me\nis that you have Windows for work groups.\n\n537\n00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,640\nHe said we probably do some place.\n\n538\n00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,430\nNot what I wanted to hear.\n\n539\n00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,860\nBut I wasn't managing a network, so and\ndoing pentas or anything on the network,\n\n540\n00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,420\nI was like yeah that's your deal.\n\n541\n00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:53,470\nYou go ahead and\ndo whatever you feel is necessary.\n\n542\n00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,220\nBut they were moving over to Windows 7,\nbut it was a big government department.\n\n543\n00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,570\nA state government department.\n\n544\n00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:05,480\nAnd yeah, it was really frightening\nthat they had that mismatch.\n\n545\n00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,270\nBut, they had to have net vios enabled.\n\n546\n00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:12,190\nThat's the only way some of\nthose older clients would\n\n547\n00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:13,500\nbe able to talk to the new stuff.\n\n548\n00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:19,730\nThen you have some of the newer,\nother software outside of Windows.\n\n549\n00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:25,650\nI know, I believe it was, I think it was\nSMS 2003 still supported NetBios for\n\n550\n00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:30,810\nthe remote desktop viewer and\nthat was still kind of amazing that\n\n551\n00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:36,710\nlate was evening using that protocol or\nthat service as part of its makeup.\n\n552\n00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,430\nIt was only recently that Microsoft\nstripped that out of that product when\n\n553\n00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,300\nthey went to SCCM.\n\n554\n00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,780\nSaying, yeah we finally got rid of that.\n\n555\n00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,800\nThey made a big deal about\nit like look what we did.\n\n556\n00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,770\nIt's like,\nit's only been like 10 years or whatever.\n\n557\n00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,700\nSometimes those big companies,\nthe right hand doesn't know what the left\n\n558\n00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,760\nhand's doing one side saying,\nhey, we're depreciating the BIOS.\n\n559\n00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,475\nIt's like, hey, we're using it in\nour current development platform.\n\n560\n00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:01,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No bueno.\n\n561\n00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,030\n>> Now as far as that service goes,\nit's still running on Windows and\n\n562\n00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,815\nit still means we can use it.\n\n563\n00:30:07,815 --> 00:30:12,010\nYou've got Windows 8.1 running over here.\n\n564\n00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,500\nAnd I did a bit of a scan against it and\n\n565\n00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:18,520\nwas able to extract some\ninformation out of it.\n\n566\n00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:22,580\nIn fact, I went ahead and\ntook the liberty of pre-running a scan\n\n567\n00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:27,850\nto get some basic information\nout of Mike's system over here.\n\n568\n00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,084\nAnd granted it's not exhaustive,\nand I'll tell you why, but\n\n569\n00:30:31,084 --> 00:30:36,640\nit's not exhaustive, but\nit is enough to get me started.\n\n570\n00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,170\nYou can see here what I have on,\nthis is SuperScan 4.1 by Foundstone.\n\n571\n00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:47,620\nFoundstone actually doesn't exist anymore,\nFoundstone was bought by Mcafee.\n\n572\n00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,640\nThey still call everything Foundstone but\nit's Mcafee.\n\n573\n00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,050\n>> That kind of worried me for a minute.\n\n574\n00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:57,310\nI remember when I first heard that\nMcafee was buying I immediately went to\n\n575\n00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,032\nFoundstone and downloaded every single\none of the free tools that I could.\n\n576\n00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,727\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I'm like okay these are going to\n\n577\n00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:02,320\ndisappear.\n\n578\n00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,912\n>> Now Mcafee gonna make money with\nthis that's why they bought them,\n\n579\n00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:07,460\nsurprisingly enough they have\nleft all that stuff free.\n\n580\n00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,140\nSo, you know one of these things that I\nwas talking about you know where do I get\n\n581\n00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,490\nthese tools from?\n\n582\n00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,660\nCause you wanna make sure you're getting\na good safe copy of these tools.\n\n583\n00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,891\nFound son's a fantastic one I think.\n\n584\n00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:20,340\n>> Yeah they haven't changed or anything.\n\n585\n00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,170\nI think they may have.\n\n586\n00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,350\nThey changed some stuff in the ULA on\ntheir site, but they did that just for\n\n587\n00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,400\nlegal reasons, they didn't actually\ntamper with the code or anything.\n\n588\n00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,820\nSo it's still a good product and\n\n589\n00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,880\nMicrosoft has got the same\nthing with their PS tool suite.\n\n590\n00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,710\n>> Yeah, here's what they did,\n>> Parts as turnles I think, or\n\n591\n00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,620\nsomething like that.\n\n592\n00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,710\n>> Yea, its just turnles,\nwinturnles something like that.\n\n593\n00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:40,680\nI always get them messed up.\n\n594\n00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,850\nBut, they acquired that and\nthey made that promise.\n\n595\n00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,820\nBut still,\nthe same thing you did with that.\n\n596\n00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,131\nThey were like; download them all,\ndownload the whole website if it requires,\n\n597\n00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:49,112\nif we're going crazy.\n\n598\n00:31:49,112 --> 00:31:54,589\nBut all Microsoft did is they stuck a\nlicensing agreement on it, you know, that\n\n599\n00:31:54,589 --> 00:32:00,092\nwas to make it consistent with everything\nelse, and those have stayed intact.\n\n600\n00:32:00,092 --> 00:32:06,440\nThe ones you see today have only been\ntweaked a bit by what was it, Russinovich?\n\n601\n00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,100\n>> I think so.\n>> Was it Scott Russinovich or\n\n602\n00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,900\nwhatever his name is?\n\n603\n00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,480\nHe tweaked it a bit, but\nhe was the one that originally created it.\n\n604\n00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,560\nHe made that deal with them that hey\nwhen you buy this, leave them alone.\n\n605\n00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,410\nAnd he tweaked them a bit along the way,\nbut they're still very useful and\n\n606\n00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,150\nvery good tools.\n\n607\n00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,270\nAnd we're gonna see them in here.\n\n608\n00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,160\nIt just got kind of,\nto mention those as well.\n\n609\n00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,370\nBut, what I have here on screen is\nyou know I have a SuperSKin 4.1.\n\n610\n00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,690\nMake sure you've got that version.\n\n611\n00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,810\nI just got caught in that\na few moments ago too.\n\n612\n00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,450\nThree is still out there, and three will\nnot be able to do what this one doing.\n\n613\n00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,610\nThree is just a port scanner.\n\n614\n00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,370\nFour can do some other stuff.\n\n615\n00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,470\nYou can see the tabs across the top for\nfour one.\n\n616\n00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,540\nThree doesn't have that.\n\n617\n00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:55,660\nThree will just have a page that\nlooks like this, and that's it.\n\n618\n00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,330\nThat's all you're gonna see.\n\n619\n00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,950\nAnd even the page doesn't\nlook exactly the same.\n\n620\n00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,020\nThis is the port scanning part.\n\n621\n00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:07,290\nLike I said yesterday when I was\ntalking about the scanning phase,\n\n622\n00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,350\nyou're probably never gonna use\nsuper scan as a port scanner.\n\n623\n00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,950\nConsidering the fact that\nunder any condition and\n\n624\n00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,530\nApp is far out powers this one.\n\n625\n00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:21,130\nBut for\ndoing different types of enumeration,\n\n626\n00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,830\nthis is actually a pretty good product for\nthat.\n\n627\n00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,760\nIt's not the only one.\n\n628\n00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,350\nBut's it's a pretty good product\nto get that ball rolling.\n\n629\n00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,740\nIf you look under its tab,\nthe Windows enumeration tab,\n\n630\n00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,060\nwhich is where I was\nwhen we switched over.\n\n631\n00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,950\nThe new Windows enumeration,\nanother thing we have here.\n\n632\n00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:43,080\nWhat I did is I went ahead and put in the\nIP address of Mike's machine over here,\n\n633\n00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,116\nand what it's done is it's\nextracted some information.\n\n634\n00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:49,105\nYou can see in here in that\nbios as you mention earlier,\n\n635\n00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:52,285\nthat bios has a name of a certain length,\nand\n\n636\n00:33:52,285 --> 00:33:56,405\nit only changes that last digit to\nreflect what service it's using.\n\n637\n00:33:56,405 --> 00:34:01,175\nWhat I'm seeing here is that\nthis is that super-scan went out\n\n638\n00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:06,195\nto Mike's system over here, QUERY'd it and\nextracted these names from it.\n\n639\n00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:10,635\nAnd we're seeing it as some of\nthe work stations services running,\n\n640\n00:34:10,635 --> 00:34:15,370\nthe server service It's giving\nme some additional names on\n\n641\n00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,070\nthis telling me these things\nare present and accounted for.\n\n642\n00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:23,420\nNow some of this stuff on here you see\nlike it says it's attempting a null\n\n643\n00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,120\nsession and it's blank and\nMAC address, it can't find one.\n\n644\n00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,590\nSome of that has to do with\nthe fact that Microsoft has been\n\n645\n00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:35,070\ndoing some stuff to lock this down\na bit more than it was in the past.\n\n646\n00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,430\nOne of the things they had in the past\nwas if you point this at any system,\n\n647\n00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:44,170\nif you point this at an XP box,\nOr you point it at a Windows 98\n\n648\n00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:48,100\nsystem if you have it, or\nan NT4 system if you've got that around.\n\n649\n00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,360\nYou will actually see that,\n\n650\n00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,360\nit just pukes it's guts out and\nputs all the stuff up here.\n\n651\n00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,220\n>> That is amazing.\n\n652\n00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,510\n>> Yeah, and why doesn't it do that now?\n\n653\n00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:01,780\nWell, Hey, you may have heard of this\nlittle setting called \"restrict anonymous\"\n\n654\n00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:08,460\nthat Microsoft put in the registry\nof modern Windows systems, and\n\n655\n00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:14,580\nwhat does is that restricts just how much\nnumeration of this service can be done.\n\n656\n00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,720\nUsing tools like this.\n\n657\n00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,710\nNow they weren't specifically\ntargeting tools like this.\n\n658\n00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:25,900\nThe idea was that when they put that in\nthere, they wanted to prevent anything.\n\n659\n00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:31,010\nAnonymous systems would come in and\nqueried and queried a box.\n\n660\n00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,570\nIn getting a lot of information about it.\n\n661\n00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:38,340\nThey want to lock that down\nas much as possible so\n\n662\n00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,030\nsomeone couldn't a,\ndo what we're doing and\n\n663\n00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:45,380\nalso to prevent unauthorized\nservices anywhere on your network.\n\n664\n00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,680\nNo matter what they might be\nfrom getting that information.\n\n665\n00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,570\nSo you could still get it, but\n\n666\n00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,550\nthere was additional\nrequirements that had to be met.\n\n667\n00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:55,455\nBefore it would do it.\n\n668\n00:35:55,455 --> 00:35:58,590\nSuper-scan, for one,\nisn't going to meet those requirements.\n\n669\n00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,470\nHowever, you could still find systems\nthat were stripped to anonymous setting.\n\n670\n00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,660\nYou know, turned to its lowest setting.\n\n671\n00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,730\nThere was actually three\nstates it could be in.\n\n672\n00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,820\nZero, one, and two.\n\n673\n00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,540\nZero is equivalent to the way\nit had been for years and years.\n\n674\n00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,700\nWhere anybody could get in.\n\n675\n00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,480\nAnd then one and two would restrict\nit to higher and higher degrees.\n\n676\n00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,250\nNow you can laugh at my computer name.\n\n677\n00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,810\nYeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n678\n00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,700\n>> So we're getting a better look at that\n\n679\n00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,590\nbut\n>> Yeah that's.\n\n680\n00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,230\n>> An impressive list of\nthings that it could scan for\n\n681\n00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,400\nover there on that left hand side.\n\n682\n00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400\n>> Oh absolutely.\n\n683\n00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,300\nAnd this attests to the power of\nthat restrict anonymous setting.\n\n684\n00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,060\nYou have it set in your system.\n\n685\n00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,860\n>> Right.\n>> But you could have easily gone.\n\n686\n00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,670\nThe registry and change it to zero.\n\n687\n00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,580\nRebooted the system and\nI could of ran the same scan and\n\n688\n00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,730\nthere would be more information,\npresumably showing.\n\n689\n00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,090\nThe other thing that does\nit is the Windows Firewall\n\n690\n00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:01,210\ntends to restrict this a bit\nmore than it would of in XP.\n\n691\n00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:05,210\nThe Vista forward firewalls are much,\nmuch better.\n\n692\n00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,270\nThan the older XP firewalls are.\n\n693\n00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:13,280\nNow if I scroll down this\nlist to just kinda show you,\n\n694\n00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280\nthere's some of the other things he has.\n\n695\n00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,870\nThe RPC information, you know remote\nprocedure calls that could be used,\n\n696\n00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,860\nand that's very common to see.\n\n697\n00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,990\nYou could actually punch in these object\nand binding stuff into google and\n\n698\n00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,150\nsee what they were referring to and get\neven more information about the system.\n\n699\n00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,550\nI'll just scroll through all of those.\n\n700\n00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,050\nYou can see there's a lot of potential\nRPC connections that could be made.\n\n701\n00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,930\nAnd if you go down to the bottom of this,\nit didn't show up again cause we had\n\n702\n00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:44,850\nthat setting set that way but\nI've actually seen it on Windows 7.\n\n703\n00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,060\nFor example, where it will actually\nstart showing you thing like,\n\n704\n00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,710\nyou can see an entry on here for\nremote services.\n\n705\n00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:57,210\nIt will actually list out all the services\nthat ran system in their current state,\n\n706\n00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,925\nwhich is actually kind of frightening.\n\n707\n00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:01,717\nYou know, so.\n\n708\n00:38:01,717 --> 00:38:04,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n709\n00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,490\nif I you know,\nif I did my loop back address.\n\n710\n00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,300\nYou know, let me just go ahead and\npunch that one in and\n\n711\n00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,840\nlet it do the enumeration on that.\n\n712\n00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,610\nWe might be a little bit more successful\non a local box but we'll see.\n\n713\n00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,586\nJust kind of show you what it\ndoes in the two situations.\n\n714\n00:38:21,586 --> 00:38:25,990\nJust FYI, if you\n\n715\n00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:31,730\ndo get a system that says it's\nallowing us to do a null session.\n\n716\n00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:35,330\nThat can be very, very, very, very bad.\n\n717\n00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:39,940\nFortunately restrict anonymous\nwill also block that.\n\n718\n00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:46,040\nBut if you can find a system that\nhas a null session capability\n\n719\n00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,070\nby doing something like this and\nyou can also do it from the command line.\n\n720\n00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,790\nI demonstrated that in my book.\n\n721\n00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,290\nYou can use the net command to see if you.\n\n722\n00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:59,830\nYou can connect to a system using a null\nsession and an anonymous user name.\n\n723\n00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,340\nIf you can do that you could actually\nstart pushing stuff onto a system and\n\n724\n00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,060\nrunning stuff remotely.\n\n725\n00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,220\n>> Right.\n>> And so that opens up,\n\n726\n00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,760\na lot of bad things could\npotentially happen at that point.\n\n727\n00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,990\nWhich is one of the reasons why Microsoft\nlocked it down with that restriction,\n\n728\n00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,050\nanonymous setting.\n\n729\n00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,960\nThey were like they didn't want\nthat to occur on people's systems.\n\n730\n00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,440\nNow why this super scans you\nknow puking up it's guts here.\n\n731\n00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,720\nLook at that.\n\n732\n00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,670\nIt looks like when you\nwatch a movie on TBS.\n\n733\n00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:36,366\nLet's get to the next thing really\nquick and it scrolls by really quick.\n\n734\n00:39:36,366 --> 00:39:39,700\nThat's what happened.\n\n735\n00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,380\nBut you can see it got some more\n\n736\n00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,750\ninformation than we were able\nto get from Mike's system.\n\n737\n00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,197\nSo this one loop back and scan itself.\n\n738\n00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:56,796\nWhat I have here,\nthis is the services stuff.\n\n739\n00:39:56,796 --> 00:40:00,841\nI mean, you could see on here I have\ninformation about services running.\n\n740\n00:40:00,841 --> 00:40:02,938\nYou know,\non this box it's saying the status of it.\n\n741\n00:40:02,938 --> 00:40:03,727\nIs it running?\n\n742\n00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:06,470\nIs it stopped?\n\n743\n00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:10,980\nSo if you're able to go out and connect\nto a system remotely using this and\n\n744\n00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,090\nthis comes back, you've really got\na good profile in the system and\n\n745\n00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,260\nnow start finding services to target.\n\n746\n00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,670\n>> Absolutely.\n>> I mean heck,\n\n747\n00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,386\nif you ran Nmap on this\nin our scanning phase.\n\n748\n00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:26,700\nNmap under the, you can tell it, there's a\nswitch in there which we didn't cover, but\n\n749\n00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,420\nyou can easily look up, there's a switch\nin there that will allow you to\n\n750\n00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,940\nfingerprint what operating system that is.\n\n751\n00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:38,340\nIf you have that and\nbrought that forward to this phase, and\n\n752\n00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,190\njust did this enumeration, hey,\nhere's all the services that are running.\n\n753\n00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:45,690\nHere's the operating system plus\nservice pack version that I know it is.\n\n754\n00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,215\nThose two things together can tell you if\nthere's any potential vulnerabilities in\n\n755\n00:40:49,215 --> 00:40:50,763\nhere that, and I may want to target.\n\n756\n00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:51,430\n>> Nice.\n\n757\n00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:55,542\n>> So now you're seeing we're\ncombining the different\n\n758\n00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:59,490\ninformation to kind of\nget a better picture.\n\n759\n00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,670\nThat's exactly what I was talking\nabout is that you have to go oh what,\n\n760\n00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,720\nhow could I use this?\n\n761\n00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,840\nWell, put it together with that,\nnow we know a little bit more and\n\n762\n00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,365\nthat we could start crafting our attack\nand sharpening our knife bit better.\n\n763\n00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:12,431\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n764\n00:41:12,431 --> 00:41:19,660\n>> So that just kind of gives you an idea\nof what you can extract with NetBIOS.\n\n765\n00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,540\nLike I said, you can do it from\nthe command line if you want.\n\n766\n00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,210\nThere's another utility that I'll\nlet you explore on your own.\n\n767\n00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:32,130\nThere's another utility called DumpSec\nthat you can attach to systems remotely or\n\n768\n00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:34,170\nyour own system locally.\n\n769\n00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,560\nAnd what you can do with that one is it\nwill actually dump stuff through NetBIOS\n\n770\n00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,390\nas well.\n\n771\n00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,652\nBut it dumps things like shares,\ninformation about a system, which\n\n772\n00:41:42,652 --> 00:41:49,630\nSuperScan can do, it can dump filesystem\npermissions, users, which is great.\n\n773\n00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:53,580\nIt can actually target a system and\nextract policy information,\n\n774\n00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,950\nwhich is really exciting, if you see that.\n\n775\n00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,860\nI mean, can you imagine,\ntargeting a remote system and\n\n776\n00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:04,110\ngetting what policies are in place.\n\n777\n00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,180\nAnd I'm talking password policy.\n\n778\n00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,850\nI'm talking how often someone has to\nreset their password, how long it can be.\n\n779\n00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,130\n>> How long.\n>> Stuff like that.\n\n780\n00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:15,670\n>> Whether it has to be complex,\nthings like that.\n\n781\n00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:18,930\nThen we can take that information into\nour next phase, we get in attack phase.\n\n782\n00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:21,040\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Because if I'm running some brute force\n\n783\n00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,180\nattack estimator, I wanna limit the number\nof possibilities it has to go through.\n\n784\n00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,650\nAnd if I already know it's an eight\ncharacter that's not complex,\n\n785\n00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,540\nI can start really fine-tuning\nthose cracking techniques.\n\n786\n00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,380\n>> There you go, that's the thing is that\nonce you start getting this information.\n\n787\n00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:42,440\nWe're getting, at this step, we've already\ngot some good information here but,\n\n788\n00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,470\nor have the potential to get\nsome good information here.\n\n789\n00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,180\nWhatever information we get we\nreally put our minds to it and\n\n790\n00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,740\nwork it and I'm gonna show you\nsome other stuff here as well.\n\n791\n00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,660\nOnce you start putting\nthose things together,\n\n792\n00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,645\nyou really can craft a good attack.\n\n793\n00:42:58,645 --> 00:43:03,520\nAnd like you were saying, the next phase\nthat we're gonna get to is gonna be\n\n794\n00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,120\ngaining access to a system and\ngaining access.\n\n795\n00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,110\nWe're talking about breaking passwords.\n\n796\n00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,860\nWe're talking about getting ready\nto plant stuff on the system and\n\n797\n00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,930\ndropping defenses on it.\n\n798\n00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:14,800\nWe're talking about all of that.\n\n799\n00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,460\nSo you're seeing that things\nare getting more and more critical.\n\n800\n00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,400\nWe're building on more and\nmore of stuff as we go through.\n\n801\n00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,840\n>> Absolutely.\n\n802\n00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,020\nAll right, well I'll tell you what.\n\n803\n00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,440\nLooking at our clock,\nit's about time to take our break.\n\n804\n00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,600\nSo why don't we stop there and\n\n805\n00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,170\nwhen we come back, we'll continue on\ntaking a look at some of the other\n\n806\n00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:34,730\nthings we can use to start enumerating\ninformation off of a system.\n\n807\n00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,556\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n808\n00:43:36,556 --> 00:43:43,180\n[MUSIC]\n\n809\n00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,350\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n810\n00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,650\nContinuing on with our enumeration phase.\n\n811\n00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:51,870\nWe took a look in that previous\nsegment on the, what did we look at?\n\n812\n00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:56,070\nWe looked at the NetBIOS and some of the\nthings we can try to enumerate with that.\n\n813\n00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,650\nWe looked at SuperScan 4.1 and\n\n814\n00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,740\nnow we're gonna take a look at some\nmore of our enumeration techniques.\n\n815\n00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,899\nSome of the other protocols and services\nthat we might try to take advantage of and\n\n816\n00:44:06,899 --> 00:44:08,930\npull back information on our targets.\n\n817\n00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:12,220\n>> Yes, that's indeed where we're going.\n\n818\n00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,530\nSo, we talked bout one of the big guys on\nthe block which is NetBIOS, gonna be one\n\n819\n00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,090\nof the most handy things you have for\nextracting information off a system.\n\n820\n00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,980\nAnd now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna move into a couple other things,\n\n821\n00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,400\nSNMP and LDAP,\nwhich we mentioned in our intro.\n\n822\n00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,971\nNow what we're gonna do is,\nwe're gonna see what that actually means.\n\n823\n00:44:31,971 --> 00:44:34,430\n>> Right\n>> Cuz two big deals.\n\n824\n00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,235\n>> Yeah, so SNMP, or\nSimple Network Management Protocol.\n\n825\n00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:39,545\nBeen around for a while, right?\n\n826\n00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:45,207\nAnd it's undergone a couple of\niterations over the last few years.\n\n827\n00:44:45,207 --> 00:44:47,367\nThey've made some changes to the protocol.\n\n828\n00:44:47,367 --> 00:44:51,557\nBut in its basic form,\nif you're not familiar with SNMP,\n\n829\n00:44:51,557 --> 00:44:55,090\nSimple Network Management Protocol,\nit's just a protocol that we can use to\n\n830\n00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:58,970\nmonitor and possibly even configure some\nof our networking devices like routers and\n\n831\n00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,258\nthings like this.\n\n832\n00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:05,280\nThose devices, if you talk to the vendor,\nthey might have modules\n\n833\n00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,580\nthat are running on those, the message\ninformation blocks, or MIBs, right.\n\n834\n00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:13,420\nAnd then we can use SNMP to\nconnect to those agents or\n\n835\n00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,960\nthose message information blocks\nretrieving information about the device.\n\n836\n00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,150\nDepending on what the device is, it could\nchange what information you get back\n\n837\n00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,960\nfrom it,\nas well as possibly writing to it.\n\n838\n00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,050\nDepending on what community string we use.\n\n839\n00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:28,790\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n840\n00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,200\nIt uses, when you talk about SNMP it\ndoes have a couple community strings.\n\n841\n00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,352\nOne's read-only and\none's readable and writable.\n\n842\n00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:39,790\nThe read-only one is called public and\nthe readable and\n\n843\n00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,010\nwritable one is called private.\n\n844\n00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:42,860\nAnd what we have is,\n\n845\n00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,135\nwe have messages going back that\nare trapped, and they indeed call it that.\n\n846\n00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,760\n>> Mm-hm, they do.\n\n847\n00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,370\n>> That are trapped by\neither the device or\n\n848\n00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:57,020\nby the console itself to tell\nwhat each side is doing.\n\n849\n00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:01,540\nAnd as you were mentioning, yeah,\nthere is that management information base\n\n850\n00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,500\nthat's essentially just\na database is all it is.\n\n851\n00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,690\nAnd it keeps records of all the objects\nthat it's responsible for managing, so\n\n852\n00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:13,390\nif you think about it,\nwe've got some juicy targets in there.\n\n853\n00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:17,465\nFirst all we have those community strings,\nwhich if someone hasn't changed.\n\n854\n00:46:17,465 --> 00:46:19,555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which is not unheard of.\n\n855\n00:46:19,555 --> 00:46:23,790\n>> Absolutely.\nIf someone hasn't changed them, it tells\n\n856\n00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,790\nus that there's, not only are those SNMP\ndevices out there, but starts telling us\n\n857\n00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:32,980\nwhere we can look to actually read those\nmessages, those traps as they come by.\n\n858\n00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,762\nIt also tells us potentially\nwhere we can send messages to,\n\n859\n00:46:36,762 --> 00:46:42,080\nto change different things on the network.\n\n860\n00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,590\nThe other thing we have is that\nmanagement information base,\n\n861\n00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:54,090\nwhere we can actually extract information\nabout the whole ecosystem itself from.\n\n862\n00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,790\nSo there's some big,\njuicy targets in that we can go after.\n\n863\n00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,930\nAnd since this has been around for\nso long, I mean,\n\n864\n00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:06,804\nthere's a lot of systems that have\nthis big, rich history of using this.\n\n865\n00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:10,060\n>> Mm-hm, absolutely and\ntalking about those defaults.\n\n866\n00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:14,427\nInitially, the read-only string was just\npublic I mean, if you typed that, and\n\n867\n00:47:14,427 --> 00:47:17,100\nprivate, if you wanted to\nget write access to it.\n\n868\n00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,470\nAnd some admins that didn't know they were\nrunning SNMP on some of these devices\n\n869\n00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:24,860\nwouldn't bother to ever change those,\nright.\n\n870\n00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,210\n>> That still is the case,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n871\n00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,400\nYou see a lot of them that ship\nwith those default names, and\n\n872\n00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,700\nthey need to be changed.\n\n873\n00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,450\nThe manufacturer needs to ship them with\nsomething, or when they get installed,\n\n874\n00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,630\nthey need to get installed with something.\n\n875\n00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,970\nYou need to take the initiative and\nchange that.\n\n876\n00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,320\nThat's Networking 101,\ndon't leave the defaults in place.\n\n877\n00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,017\nBut it does happen.\n\n878\n00:47:47,017 --> 00:47:51,051\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Either through laziness or ignorance or\n\n879\n00:47:51,051 --> 00:47:52,214\nwhat have you.\n\n880\n00:47:52,214 --> 00:47:53,733\nThey stay that way.\n\n881\n00:47:53,733 --> 00:47:57,882\nIt's not 100%, so don't expect to find it,\nand you may have to use other means.\n\n882\n00:47:57,882 --> 00:48:00,531\nDetect what the real\ncommunity strings are, but\n\n883\n00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:03,640\nit's not unheard of to see public and\nprivate out there.\n\n884\n00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:06,800\n>> All right, no bueno.\n\n885\n00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,610\nSo, SNMPs, one thing we can use.\n\n886\n00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:11,650\nAgain, getting information back,\nsort of enumerating devices and\n\n887\n00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,590\nmaybe getting information\nabout those devices.\n\n888\n00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:18,580\nLDAP is another one,\nour Lightweight Directory Access Protocol,\n\n889\n00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,180\nwhich is used by several of our directory\nstores including Active Directory.\n\n890\n00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,370\nIt's a language or a standard,\nit's not a Microsoft thing.\n\n891\n00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:30,910\nIt's a standard that we can use to query\nthose directory stores, which means\n\n892\n00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,840\nI might be able to take advantage of\nthat to query those directory stores and\n\n893\n00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:39,110\nretrieve information like start listing\nusers and groups, and things like that.\n\n894\n00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,430\n>> Yeah, yes indeed.\n\n895\n00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,830\nLDAP is a, as you mentioned is a standard.\n\n896\n00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:47,305\nIt's something that's used by multiple\ndirectories directory services.\n\n897\n00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:49,425\nIn fact I saw here in\nthe discussion earlier,\n\n898\n00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:53,865\nsomeone was mentioning about one of\nthe other directory services that uses it.\n\n899\n00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:56,195\nIt's a popular protocol.\n\n900\n00:48:56,195 --> 00:48:58,225\nIt's something that's easily understood.\n\n901\n00:48:58,225 --> 00:49:00,745\nIt's something that's\nsupported by all of them and\n\n902\n00:49:00,745 --> 00:49:04,525\nthat's why some directory services, or\nin fact, really any directory service that\n\n903\n00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:10,880\nuses LDAP can't work with other ones\nbecause it's speaking the same language.\n\n904\n00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,040\nSo an LDAP is not a difficult\nlanguage to understand.\n\n905\n00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,360\nIt's something that is\nvery easy to understand.\n\n906\n00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,130\nIt's got a structure.\n\n907\n00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:24,420\nI like to say that if you\nunderstand the way DNS works and\n\n908\n00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,165\nthe structure of DNS and\nwhole hierarchy in there,\n\n909\n00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:30,245\nyou can pretty much reach read\nthe way LDAP works as well.\n\n910\n00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:33,155\nMaybe it might be structured\na little bit differently in the way\n\n911\n00:49:33,155 --> 00:49:34,715\nthey call things out.\n\n912\n00:49:34,715 --> 00:49:39,570\nBut there still is that hierarchy in it so\nyou can understand it.\n\n913\n00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,550\nYeah I like that term hierarchical right\nbecause if you've played with int in\n\n914\n00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,980\nWindows, if you've played\nwith distinguished names,\n\n915\n00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,540\nyou know that that's basically the path\nto the object in the database.\n\n916\n00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,160\nAnd depending on which\nway you want to read it,\n\n917\n00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,090\nif you're going from left to right,\nyou're starting with the object and\n\n918\n00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,440\nworking your way back\nup that directory tree.\n\n919\n00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,650\nBut you can start from the right and\ngo to the left and\n\n920\n00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:02,330\nyou're working from the root of that\ntree back down to that specific object.\n\n921\n00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:06,700\nSo like Sean says, it's very easy to\nstart familiarizing yourself with it.\n\n922\n00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:07,890\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n923\n00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,120\nAnd it's well documented.\n\n924\n00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,650\nIt's standardized, so\nit's very easy to find information on it.\n\n925\n00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:18,340\nAnd since it's tied back to\na director service, you know.\n\n926\n00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,640\nI'd say better than nine times out of ten,\nbut we'll say nine times out of ten here,\n\n927\n00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,430\nit's tied back to a directory\nservice behind it.\n\n928\n00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,590\nThat's the other big juicy target for you.\n\n929\n00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:31,930\nYou can ascertain what that\ndirectory service is doing, and\n\n930\n00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,920\nmaybe do manipulations on that\ndirectory service as well.\n\n931\n00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:35,720\n>> That's true.\n\n932\n00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:39,160\n>> And the cool thing about it is there's\na lot of tools you get to read LDAP right\n\n933\n00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,130\nout of the box.\n\n934\n00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,290\n>> Yeah.\n\n935\n00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:45,028\nAnd Fabian has a good question here,\ndoes Max support LDAP as well and\n\n936\n00:50:45,028 --> 00:50:47,907\ndo they do their open directory on-\n>> Yeah I believe it's open directory.\n\n937\n00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:50,370\n>> On Mac which is an LDAP\ncompliant data base as well.\n\n938\n00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:53,990\nI mean it's used by most of our\ndirectory stores cause it is so\n\n939\n00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,100\nwell developed and\nrelatively easy to work with.\n\n940\n00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,990\nTrying to think of some of the built\nin tools with Windows, it's been so\n\n941\n00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:03,970\nlong since I've done any direct\nqueries into my database.\n\n942\n00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:07,860\nWe used to have a couple\nof those low level tools,\n\n943\n00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,670\nwhat wasn't LDP one of them actually.\n\n944\n00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,390\n>> LDP is the big one,\nis definitely the big one.\n\n945\n00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:20,470\nSo, Microsoft provides that to query\ninteract with the LDAP protocol and\n\n946\n00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,360\ndirector service itself, its right there.\n\n947\n00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,870\nYou now it's not a malicious tool.\n\n948\n00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:27,420\nIt's not a good tool, not a bad tool.\n\n949\n00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,340\nIt's just a tool.\n\n950\n00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,290\nYou can use it for\n\n951\n00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:34,140\nthis to query information and\nit's not the only tool out there either.\n\n952\n00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,950\nThat just happens to\nbe a command line one.\n\n953\n00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:40,980\nThere's plenty of other ones out there\nthat can be used to view LDAP Services.\n\n954\n00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:45,460\nA lot of them are like specifically\ndesigned to be directory browsers.\n\n955\n00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:50,120\nYou know, you see for example third\nparty utilities that are designed\n\n956\n00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,430\nto ease the administration\nof your directory service.\n\n957\n00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:57,880\nI can think of a few for\nactive directory that\n\n958\n00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,080\nMicrosoft's own third party vendors\nmake that are saying you know what,\n\n959\n00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,770\nif you don't like active\ndirectory users on computers.\n\n960\n00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,540\nYou can use our stuff to browse\nthrough the whole hierarchy,\n\n961\n00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:11,840\nto see domains and\norganizational units and all that.\n\n962\n00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,810\nIt just allows it and maybe provides\na few more bells and whistles so\n\n963\n00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:19,680\nyou don't necessarily need to have access\nto those consoles you can actually just\n\n964\n00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,720\ngo ahead and get one of these tools and\nstill do the same thing.\n\n965\n00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:26,050\nAnd good thing about it is a lot\nof them are actually free, too.\n\n966\n00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:32,040\nSo, you got a lot of power there at your\nhands without investing any money and\n\n967\n00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:32,989\nreally to do it.\n\n968\n00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:36,060\n>> [LAUGH] And so really you're limited.\n\n969\n00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,280\nYou gotta gain access to\nthe database obviously.\n\n970\n00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:39,750\nHave some credentials to get in there.\n\n971\n00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,420\nBut yeah.\n>> There's one that\n\n972\n00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,185\nRobert actually mentioned a free one.\n\n973\n00:52:44,185 --> 00:52:45,150\nLDAP administrator.\n\n974\n00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:46,900\n>> Yeah.\nAnother good one.\n\n975\n00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,460\n>> Yeah, thanks for\nmentioning that Robert.\n\n976\n00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,490\nThat's just one of many that\nare actually out there.\n\n977\n00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:55,330\nI mean, that's so\nwe've got the Microsoft one and\n\n978\n00:52:55,330 --> 00:52:58,850\nthen we have another third\nparty one that's free.\n\n979\n00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:03,390\nAnd it's worth mentioning too since we\ndidn't also, just to go back for a minute.\n\n980\n00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,690\nIt's the same thing with SNMP too.\n\n981\n00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,850\nSNMP, much like LDAP is a public,\nis a standard,\n\n982\n00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:15,800\nis a publicly used protocol,\nand so there's tools for that.\n\n983\n00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,962\nOne of them is McAfee\nhas one called SNS Scan.\n\n984\n00:53:18,962 --> 00:53:22,740\nThat used specifically to look at SNMP but\n\n985\n00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:25,410\nthere's also plenty of\nother tools out there.\n\n986\n00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,870\nLike I said just like much like LDAP.\n\n987\n00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:30,920\nLDAP make these tools, Microsoft has one,\nthere's this LDAP administrator.\n\n988\n00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:36,603\nTheir coming across fast and furious now.\n\n989\n00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:37,246\n>> I love it.\n\n990\n00:53:37,246 --> 00:53:38,645\n>> We've got incoming.\n\n991\n00:53:38,645 --> 00:53:41,390\n[LAUGH] So we've got a few.\n\n992\n00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:47,050\nIt's the same thing with say an SMNP,\ntons of tools out there\n\n993\n00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:52,290\nthat you can use to browse that service.\n\n994\n00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:54,309\nThere's nothing, it's the standard.\n\n995\n00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,290\nHeck everyone has built stuff for\n\n996\n00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:00,762\nit because they have an easier way of\ndoing things, or they think they have\n\n997\n00:54:00,762 --> 00:54:04,570\nan easy way of doing things or\na different angle on it, whatever.\n\n998\n00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,920\nThey are out there, so you've got\nplenty of tools at your disposal.\n\n999\n00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,180\nYou don't need to install all\nof the like active directory or\n\n1000\n00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,540\nsome big expensive management agent.\n\n1001\n00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:19,610\nI know one of the ones I find, and it's\nnot to pick on EC Council at this point,\n\n1002\n00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:24,340\njust to kind of show you\nthe thinking there is SNMP.\n\n1003\n00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,690\nOne of the ones that they\nmentioned is one called,\n\n1004\n00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:29,075\nI don't know if you've heard of this Mike,\nHP OpenView?\n\n1005\n00:54:29,075 --> 00:54:30,710\n>> Uh-uh.\n>> Heard of that?\n\n1006\n00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:31,530\n>> No.\n>> Some people out\n\n1007\n00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:35,660\nhere may have heard of it, but\nit's an enterprise holder utility.\n\n1008\n00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,600\nThat's in the six figure range to get and\n\n1009\n00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,860\nrequires a lot of training and\na lot of specialized training to use.\n\n1010\n00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,140\nIt's recommended as\na penetration testing tool.\n\n1011\n00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:47,690\nNo way.\n\n1012\n00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,640\nThat's, [LAUGH], that;s not gonna happen.\n\n1013\n00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,470\n>> Maybe once I'm making six figures or\nsomething like that.\n\n1014\n00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:55,470\n>> And even if you could get it for free,\n\n1015\n00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,220\nsomething that complex\n>> Is not something you're\n\n1016\n00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:59,720\ngoing to use as a pen tester.\n\n1017\n00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,620\nYou're just, it's just not going to\nhappen because it has to be installed,\n\n1018\n00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,480\nconfigured.\n\n1019\n00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,390\nIt has to be put in place.\n\n1020\n00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:09,820\nThe only way I can see that you even have\na chance of using something that complex\n\n1021\n00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,450\nis if you bust into a system\nthat already used it to monitor.\n\n1022\n00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:18,020\nGranted those systems are pretty\npowerful to monitor stuff like SNMP.\n\n1023\n00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:23,400\n>> But it's, some enterprises do have it,\nbut those usually,\n\n1024\n00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,730\nlike I said, large companies, governmental\norganizations, stuff like that.\n\n1025\n00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,800\nIt's not something that\nyou should really rely on.\n\n1026\n00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,430\nThey have administrators that\nspecialized in that, and\n\n1027\n00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,930\ntraining that's specialized for that.\n\n1028\n00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:37,359\nYou're not going to have\nthat as a pen tester,\n\n1029\n00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,474\nI personally like to use these public\ntools, these small lightweight tools,\n\n1030\n00:55:41,474 --> 00:55:44,738\nI can easily just swap out and\nreplace it with something else.\n\n1031\n00:55:44,738 --> 00:55:47,401\nAnd it's really cool,\nSNMP and LDAP are like that.\n\n1032\n00:55:47,401 --> 00:55:51,083\nYou know, with Microsoft's LDAP Hey,\nyou don't have to use that.\n\n1033\n00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:53,827\nYou don't like Microsoft, or heck,\n\n1034\n00:55:53,827 --> 00:55:58,900\nyou're not even using Microsoft product,\nyour using Linux, fine.\n\n1035\n00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,874\nThere's tons of them over on that side,\ntoo.\n\n1036\n00:56:00,874 --> 00:56:01,378\n>> Right.\n>> I like that\n\n1037\n00:56:01,378 --> 00:56:02,809\n>> And no HP Open GL.\n\n1038\n00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:05,840\n>> [LAUGH] Somebody had a little\n\n1039\n00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,480\nexperience with it.\n\n1040\n00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:10,665\n>> That's one negative vote or\nno vote for it, right?\n\n1041\n00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:12,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1042\n00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,720\nMichael brings up a good point there too.\n\n1043\n00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,508\nMichael in our chat room talked,\nwas it Michael, yeah,\n\n1044\n00:56:16,508 --> 00:56:20,440\ntalking about dsgets, some ds,\nall those ds commands.\n\n1045\n00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,280\nAnd he mentions that most of\nActive Directories open all.\n\n1046\n00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,730\nAnd that is true now, but\nit is the authenticated users, right,\n\n1047\n00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:27,750\nnot the everyone group.\n\n1048\n00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:32,390\nSo we would have to have some\nkind of credentials like that.\n\n1049\n00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,810\nBut yes you are correct, Active Directory.\n\n1050\n00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,340\n>> But\nis readable by everybody on the domain, so\n\n1051\n00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,862\nthat we can query for other things.\n\n1052\n00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:42,930\nYou know, find users, share certificates,\nand things like that.\n\n1053\n00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:46,910\n>> Yeah, Michael you're actually ahead of\nthe curve here on that one a little bit.\n\n1054\n00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:52,038\nYou may not realize it but you're a little\nahead of the curve on that one cuz yeah,\n\n1055\n00:56:52,038 --> 00:56:54,750\nDS query, DS get,\nthere's DS add and all those ones.\n\n1056\n00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,860\n>> DS mod, DS rm.\n\n1057\n00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:58,580\n>> Yeah DS mod,\nall those ones for doing that.\n\n1058\n00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,921\nThere's plenty of tools for that.\n\n1059\n00:56:59,921 --> 00:57:02,931\nYeah, as he says you have\nto be on the network, and\n\n1060\n00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:06,250\nyou were testing the fact you\nneed to be on the network.\n\n1061\n00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,830\nWe know that.\n\n1062\n00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:11,790\nThe thing is is that, yeah, you're ahead\nof the curve because you're right.\n\n1063\n00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:13,450\nWhat if you found out through LDAP,\n\n1064\n00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,140\nand well it wouldn't be SNP, but\nyou found it through LDAP and your\n\n1065\n00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,700\nport scans because you can vent through\nport scans and DNS enumeration as well.\n\n1066\n00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,350\nIf Active Directory is there,\nand you're salivating man,\n\n1067\n00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:28,870\nyou've found it that it's there, and\nyou want to use these commands, but you're\n\n1068\n00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:34,330\nsaying well I've gotta be on the network\nto do that, to start messing with that.\n\n1069\n00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:38,735\nWell, The thing with that is,\nwe haven't got to it yet, but\n\n1070\n00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:40,725\nthere is something that we're\ngonna see when we gain access.\n\n1071\n00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:42,195\nIt's called privilege escalation.\n\n1072\n00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:44,755\nYou penetrate into the network,\n\n1073\n00:57:44,755 --> 00:57:48,477\nyou compromise an account,\nthen you escalate privileges.\n\n1074\n00:57:48,477 --> 00:57:51,377\nNow you can run those,\nyou just came right in and\n\n1075\n00:57:51,377 --> 00:57:54,065\nnow you're bringing the information\nin going oh, I remember.\n\n1076\n00:57:54,065 --> 00:57:59,257\nI remember DNS told me that their service\nrecords, through port 368 is open for\n\n1077\n00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:01,980\nthe global catalog and\nI see all these other things.\n\n1078\n00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,060\nI know Active Directory is sitting there.\n\n1079\n00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:08,170\nI'm just going to put that off to the\nside, penetrate in, raise my privileges,\n\n1080\n00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,240\nand them I'm going to go ahead and\n\n1081\n00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,700\nuse those commands to get\nmore information out of it.\n\n1082\n00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,049\n>> So a lot of different things we can try\nto retrieve with SNMP and with our LDAP.\n\n1083\n00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,440\nWhat else do we got?\n\n1084\n00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,450\nOh, we talked about the.\n\n1085\n00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:25,090\n>> Well, I think its useful because we've\ngot several things that we should go\n\n1086\n00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:28,550\nthrough as far as security and\nthose things.\n\n1087\n00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:32,730\nLet's talk about counter measures\nreally quick for SNMP and LDAP.\n\n1088\n00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:33,480\nSince they are open,\n\n1089\n00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,140\nwhen we're talking about these tools,\nI don't want anyone to freak out about it.\n\n1090\n00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:37,925\nThere are ways.\n\n1091\n00:58:37,925 --> 00:58:41,150\nSNMP, you can protect that pretty easily.\n\n1092\n00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,450\nThere's actually three\nversions of that protocol.\n\n1093\n00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:46,290\nYeah, we talked about changing\nthe defaults and stuff like that,\n\n1094\n00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,920\nbut there's three versions\nof that protocol.\n\n1095\n00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,310\nThere's SNMP one, two, and three.\n\n1096\n00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:52,570\nOne should never be used,\none's old school,\n\n1097\n00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,700\nit should absolutely never be used.\n\n1098\n00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,460\nIt sends everything in the clear.\n\n1099\n00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:59,970\nTwo and three encrypt things now and\nsign stuff now.\n\n1100\n00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:04,840\nSo now that actually goes against\nme tampering with that or\n\n1101\n00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,080\neven reading it in the first place.\n\n1102\n00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:11,090\nSo remember those little things,\nthat's a prime countermeasure for it.\n\n1103\n00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,500\nThat's why within the first couple days of\n\n1104\n00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:21,770\nthis course we were talking about\nencryption because it plays a vital role.\n\n1105\n00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,270\nIt's very hard to tamper with.\n\n1106\n00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,975\nIt's not impossible, but it's very hard\nto tamper with what you can't read.\n\n1107\n00:59:26,975 --> 00:59:27,700\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n1108\n00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,640\n>> It's very hard to spoof something\nthat has been digitally signed and\n\n1109\n00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,800\nauthenticated.\n\n1110\n00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,680\nSo that's a big value there.\n\n1111\n00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:41,070\nAnd for LDAP, LDAP, the good news is,\nis that systems either\n\n1112\n00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:48,030\noffer a way to use some sort of\nimplementation of SSL to encrypt it.\n\n1113\n00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,085\nMicrosoft uses one by default.\n\n1114\n00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:55,255\nTheir LDAP queries already have\na way of being encrypted in there,\n\n1115\n00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:59,095\nand the current versions of\nActive Directory actually do that.\n\n1116\n00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:01,035\nIf memory serves serves correctly,\nthey do.\n\n1117\n01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:01,825\n>> Yeah.\n\n1118\n01:00:01,825 --> 01:00:02,389\nAbsolutely right.\n\n1119\n01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:10,222\nSo, SNMP, LDAP, what's another one we\ncould use to start doing some enumeration?\n\n1120\n01:00:10,222 --> 01:00:15,190\n>> Well, NTP, I think, is another,\na good one to end things off here.\n\n1121\n01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:17,370\n>> Yeah,\nthe one we've been dying to see, right?\n\n1122\n01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:23,300\n>> Yeah, you kind of wonder about\nthat one when you hear about it.\n\n1123\n01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,130\nI put some commands in\nmy book on this one.\n\n1124\n01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:30,180\nThe commands are one thing, but\nlet me really get into why NTP\n\n1125\n01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:34,660\nis something that should\nattract your attention.\n\n1126\n01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,150\nNTP is Network Time Protocol.\n\n1127\n01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,800\nLike we were saying in our intro to this\n\n1128\n01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,730\nthat NTP is something you\nuse to synchronize clocks.\n\n1129\n01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:46,790\nFirst of all,\nwhy do you need to synchronize clocks?\n\n1130\n01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:49,130\nWell, let's look in the Microsoft world.\n\n1131\n01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,970\n>> Yeah.\n>> Clocks aren't synchronized,\n\n1132\n01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,250\nKerberos ain't working.\n\n1133\n01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:52,830\n>> Right.\n\n1134\n01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:59,150\nBy default, in our group policy that's\nattached to our, at the domain level.\n\n1135\n01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:01,068\nIt's five minutes, you can change that.\n\n1136\n01:01:01,068 --> 01:01:04,500\nBut if your system clocks are off by more\nthan five minutes from what the domain\n\n1137\n01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,970\ncontroller says it is, it's not\ngoing to allow you to authenticate.\n\n1138\n01:01:06,970 --> 01:01:09,820\nIt assumes that their might\nbe some foul play going on,\n\n1139\n01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,920\nand it says; we're not going\nto allow you to authenticate.\n\n1140\n01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,520\nSo we've got to make sure our logs\nare synchronized for that, I mean,\n\n1141\n01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:16,900\nour clocks are synchronized for that.\n\n1142\n01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,110\nThe other one is log files though.\n\n1143\n01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:21,440\nIf you're starting to, if you're looking\nat log files on your router, and\n\n1144\n01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,330\nyou're tracing this attack\nback through your network, and\n\n1145\n01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:26,830\nyou're looking at log files on your\nserver, if those times aren't synced up,\n\n1146\n01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:30,830\nit's gonna be very difficult to try to\nsync up the events that are going on and\n\n1147\n01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,810\nactually see that attack work\nits way through your network.\n\n1148\n01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:36,030\nYeah, exactly.\n\n1149\n01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:39,810\nSo, like you said,\nyou've got Kerberos time stamps and stuff.\n\n1150\n01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,880\nAnd if there's too much variation,\n\n1151\n01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,790\nit doesn't matter if you've\ntyped in stuff correctly or not.\n\n1152\n01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,710\nYou type in your username and\npassword correctly and\n\n1153\n01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:47,910\nit goes to authenticate and gets Kerberos.\n\n1154\n01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,930\nWhen it generates the tickets and\n\n1155\n01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:54,500\nall that, what's gonna happen is it's\ngonna say well, it doesn't matter.\n\n1156\n01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:55,670\nTime's invalid.\n\n1157\n01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:58,558\nSomebody's either trying to do\na replay attack or man in the middle.\n\n1158\n01:01:58,558 --> 01:01:59,360\n>> Mm-hmm.\n>> That's gonna\n\n1159\n01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,740\n>> Or it's just used to defend\n\n1160\n01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:01,780\nagainst that.\n\n1161\n01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,760\nSo, very vital for that.\n\n1162\n01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:06,450\nIt's one of the reasons why,\nwhen you're in a Kerberos network,\n\n1163\n01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:09,670\nthat if you, sometimes you go into\nthe clock, it's gonna say no,\n\n1164\n01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:13,960\nyou can't change this\nbecause of that reason.\n\n1165\n01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,470\nAnd so, there's some critical\nthings going on there.\n\n1166\n01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,660\nBut what an NTP.\n\n1167\n01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:23,319\nNone of the stuff we said\nwith log files or Kerberos,\n\n1168\n01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:28,492\nreally say how does this play into\nenumeration: log files and Kerberos?\n\n1169\n01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:30,970\nWell those things don't, but\n\n1170\n01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:36,300\nthere's something else with\nNTP which you may not realize.\n\n1171\n01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,400\nNTP, when these systems\nare querying NTP to synchronize\n\n1172\n01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,380\ntheir clocks, NTP in a lot of\ncases keeps a record of that.\n\n1173\n01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:50,020\nSo if something comes from\nMike's System here connects to NTP,\n\n1174\n01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:55,830\nit's gonna leave that IP\naddress on the NTP server.\n\n1175\n01:02:55,830 --> 01:03:01,040\nSo it means now I can use, there's\ncommands for NTP like NTP trace and\n\n1176\n01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:06,875\nstuff like that, that, that you can use to\nquery the NTP server and have it retrieve\n\n1177\n01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:12,475\na list of the last, in some cases the last\n200 to 500 computers that attached to it.\n\n1178\n01:03:12,475 --> 01:03:18,350\nSo by having a list of IPs,\nyou've got targets now.\n\n1179\n01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:20,960\nYou've got live targets.\n\n1180\n01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,510\n>> We know they're now\nsynchronizing their clocks.\n\n1181\n01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,310\nNTB's gonna be there.\n\n1182\n01:03:26,310 --> 01:03:29,160\nIt's not like we can't run it\nin our Windows environment.\n\n1183\n01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:31,210\nIf we're in a Windows environment and\nmost environments need it.\n\n1184\n01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:38,760\n>> Now there's another little\nthing to this you need to read in.\n\n1185\n01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:44,140\nThere's tools that are designed to\ndetect the NTP servers on a network.\n\n1186\n01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,006\nYou can run them really easily and\n\n1187\n01:03:46,006 --> 01:03:49,211\nNTP servers aren't typically\nprotected all that well.\n\n1188\n01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:53,485\nBut you don't really look at them that\nway or like it synchronizes clocks.\n\n1189\n01:03:53,485 --> 01:03:55,270\nGood, you know what time it is.\n\n1190\n01:03:55,270 --> 01:04:01,596\nWhatever that's the typical thinking, but\nlets look at it from another standpoint.\n\n1191\n01:04:01,596 --> 01:04:06,498\nWe mentioned Corber and\nyou know we know and a lot of you out\n\n1192\n01:04:06,498 --> 01:04:12,500\nthere know Corber is used by active\ndirectory to authenticate, okay?\n\n1193\n01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:18,580\nIf I was to ask you, Mike, which system\nthe NTP server are on a Microsoft network,\n\n1194\n01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:20,150\nwhat is that most likely to be?\n\n1195\n01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:21,930\n>> That's on my primary domain controller,\n\n1196\n01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:25,370\nmy PDC emulator is that\nwhere that's being hosted.\n\n1197\n01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:27,050\nWhich is one of my domain controllers.\n\n1198\n01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:29,290\nYeah, you've got it exactly.\n\n1199\n01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:33,540\nIs that, yeah, it's gonna be on a network,\n\n1200\n01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:38,510\nit's gonna be a domain controller and that\ndomain controller is the PDC emulator.\n\n1201\n01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:41,160\nUnless someone's moved it,\nthat's what it's gonna be.\n\n1202\n01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:46,540\nSo even if we ignore the PDC emulator,\nyou've got a domain controller.\n\n1203\n01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:50,700\nYou found one just by virtue of quarrying,\nfinding the address.\n\n1204\n01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,824\nOf an NTP system so you've got some\nreally juicy information right there.\n\n1205\n01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:56,599\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1206\n01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:57,728\n>> You got a target.\n\n1207\n01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:01,880\nNow a word of caution when\nyou're doing your pen test.\n\n1208\n01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,620\nMake sure when you're doing\nyour pen test if you start\n\n1209\n01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,070\nuncovering domain controllers.\n\n1210\n01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:13,980\nMake sure it's okay with your client\nthat you can tamper with those.\n\n1211\n01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:20,430\nIt's not uncommon for\nclients to say and businesses to say.\n\n1212\n01:05:20,430 --> 01:05:23,760\nBasically, do a form of gray box testing,\nwhich is where they give you limited\n\n1213\n01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,060\ninformation, and what they'll do is,\nin a gray box test, they might give you\n\n1214\n01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:32,290\nlimited information on here are the names\nand IP addresses of domain controllers and\n\n1215\n01:05:32,290 --> 01:05:36,910\nsome other sensitive systems, and what\nthey'll say is if you find these systems\n\n1216\n01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:40,440\nanytime during your pen test, don't\nmess with them, stop what you're doing.\n\n1217\n01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,570\nAnd let us know because\nthe test is over at that point.\n\n1218\n01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:47,190\nThey want you to be able to find those\nthings but not tamper with them.\n\n1219\n01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:50,550\nAnd do you really want someone\nmessing with your domain controllers?\n\n1220\n01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,404\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n1221\n01:05:51,404 --> 01:05:52,726\n[LAUGH]\n>> If you find them.\n\n1222\n01:05:52,726 --> 01:05:53,902\nOkay, you've proven your point.\n\n1223\n01:05:53,902 --> 01:05:54,910\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1224\n01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:55,410\nI give.\n\n1225\n01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:58,680\nMercy.\n>> We need to build some layers in there.\n\n1226\n01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,840\nTo keep that from happening.\n\n1227\n01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:04,500\nThe attacker should not be able\nto get that far, you know so\n\n1228\n01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:08,310\nI don't need you to start monkeying\nwith the domain control to prove a point\n\n1229\n01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,420\n>> So make sure you know where you stand.\n\n1230\n01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,480\nSome businesses might say go for\nit you know?\n\n1231\n01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:16,860\n>> Right.\n>> See what you can do.\n\n1232\n01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,720\n>> We got a good backup\nwe're not worried about it.\n\n1233\n01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,310\n>> Yeah, they might say hey I don't\ncare if I loose the domain control or\n\n1234\n01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,380\ntwo maybe it will be fine.\n\n1235\n01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:27,390\nBut don't just go through considering\nthe value of something like that,\n\n1236\n01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:28,780\nand that's the heart of a whole network.\n\n1237\n01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:30,650\nIf you mess around with\nthe domain controller and\n\n1238\n01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:35,420\ntake someone's network out, literally\nthe whole network, you take out active\n\n1239\n01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:39,410\ndirectory you're taking the exchange and\na whole bunch of other stuff out with it.\n\n1240\n01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,240\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1241\n01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,320\n>> They could be pretty\nticked off if you do that,\n\n1242\n01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:46,500\nso make sure\n>> Your contract covers that or\n\n1243\n01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,990\nit's time to stop what you're doing.\n\n1244\n01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,880\n>> That could lead to a lot of down time\nfor your client and that's not what you're\n\n1245\n01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,880\nthere to do, is tear down their\nbusiness so very good point.\n\n1246\n01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,660\nAlright well, tell you what, we are just\nabout out of time for this segment so\n\n1247\n01:06:58,660 --> 01:06:59,210\nwhy don't we stop,\n\n1248\n01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:03,600\ntake a quick break here, when we come back\nwe will continue on with our enumeration.\n\n1249\n01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:10,080\nSee you soon.\n[MUSIC]\n\n1250\n01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,000\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n1251\n01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,490\nContinuing on with our\nenumeration phase here.\n\n1252\n01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,290\nAnd we're gonna dive back into looking at\nsome of the protocols and services that we\n\n1253\n01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:23,110\ncan try to take advantage of to enumerate\ninformation off of a target system.\n\n1254\n01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:25,150\nNext on the list SMTP.\n\n1255\n01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:29,270\nIt'll Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.\n\n1256\n01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:30,100\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1257\n01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:36,500\n>> SMTP, it's an old protocol,\nbeen around for\n\n1258\n01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:41,380\nquite a while, used to\n>> To transfer messages between systems,\n\n1259\n01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,710\ntypically associated with email.\n\n1260\n01:07:43,710 --> 01:07:48,490\nTo send email from one system to another,\nto another where it can be retrieved by\n\n1261\n01:07:48,490 --> 01:07:53,690\nusing a pop protocol to pull stuff down or\nimap to read it on the server.\n\n1262\n01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:58,000\nSo, it's just part of that\necosystem of transferring messages.\n\n1263\n01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,190\n>> So the question is is, you know,\n\n1264\n01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:05,560\nhow could we use this to get information\nout of a system to enumerate things?\n\n1265\n01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:10,190\nWell, in this case SMTP is\nuseful to enumerate information\n\n1266\n01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:11,610\nin the form of username.\n\n1267\n01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:14,750\nand it's actually very useful for that.\n\n1268\n01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,800\nThe way.\n\n1269\n01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,960\n>> Yeah you're right\n>> It's incredibly useful for doing that,\n\n1270\n01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:25,530\nbecause what you can do is you can\nuse the telnet command to tell\n\n1271\n01:08:25,530 --> 01:08:30,590\nit at the command line, basically what you\ndo is do telnet, the name of the server,\n\n1272\n01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:35,710\neither name or ip address,\n>> And then do the SMTP port.\n\n1273\n01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:37,920\nI'll let you guys look it up.\n\n1274\n01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,190\n>> First one to pop that\nin gets a gold star.\n\n1275\n01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:42,680\n>> I can't give this to you people.\n\n1276\n01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,270\nAnd I don't want to work that hard.\n\n1277\n01:08:45,270 --> 01:08:46,678\nIt's late in the day.\n\n1278\n01:08:46,678 --> 01:08:49,860\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> His mind is still saving the world\n\n1279\n01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:50,450\nover there.\n\n1280\n01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:50,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1281\n01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,150\n>> As you guys see,\n\n1282\n01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:56,250\nthat crashed the system getting\nback here to you people.\n\n1283\n01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,850\nSo, we're cooking eggs with\nwireless networks in here too.\n\n1284\n01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:00,530\n>> Yeah, we are.\n\n1285\n01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:01,860\n>> So that's part of a science experiment.\n\n1286\n01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:05,690\nSo, stuff starts squirting out\nof my ears that's what happened.\n\n1287\n01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:09,800\nBut yeah, you can actually use a,\nyou can actually go into SMTP and\n\n1288\n01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:14,260\ngrab information,\nyou just have to telnet and connect to it.\n\n1289\n01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,920\n>> Right.\n>> But that's only half the battle.\n\n1290\n01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:20,063\nAs they say, knowing is half the battle.\n\n1291\n01:09:20,063 --> 01:09:20,702\n>> G.I.\nJoe?\n\n1292\n01:09:20,702 --> 01:09:21,885\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1293\n01:09:21,885 --> 01:09:23,342\n>> [LAUGH] You know,\n\n1294\n01:09:23,342 --> 01:09:25,990\nso\n>> Oh great, just spoil it for everybody.\n\n1295\n01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:28,080\n>> Oh, and James [CROSSTALK] that was\na close tie there I'll give James and\n\n1296\n01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:28,624\nRobert that one.\n\n1297\n01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:30,496\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n1298\n01:09:30,496 --> 01:09:35,903\nyeah you telnet into that port, and\nonce you've done that now comes the point\n\n1299\n01:09:35,903 --> 01:09:39,990\nwhere once you've got the connection\n>> And you're successful\n\n1300\n01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:44,540\nat that connection, now what you do,\nis you can start issuing commands.\n\n1301\n01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:46,690\nAnd the commands you're gonna issue,\n\n1302\n01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:50,854\nthere's really a small handful of\nones you can issue at that point.\n\n1303\n01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:55,970\nOne of of them is vrfy, or verify,\nand that's what you can do,\n\n1304\n01:09:55,970 --> 01:10:00,640\nyou can do a vrfy space and\nthen an email address, and\n\n1305\n01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,875\nwhat will happen is it can tell you if\nthat email address actually exists.\n\n1306\n01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:09,085\nAnd if it doesn't, it'll say, not found,\nif it does, it'll come back and say, yes,\n\n1307\n01:10:09,085 --> 01:10:11,305\nI found that one, I'll confirm it.\n\n1308\n01:10:11,305 --> 01:10:16,375\nIf you find a distribution list or\nyou need to expand out a name,\n\n1309\n01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:20,885\nthere's an expand command that\nyou can use to actually use to\n\n1310\n01:10:22,195 --> 01:10:24,375\nexpand out a name to it's full length.\n\n1311\n01:10:24,375 --> 01:10:26,325\nIf you have a distribution\nlist it will expand out all\n\n1312\n01:10:26,325 --> 01:10:28,350\nthe names of the distribution list.\n\n1313\n01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:31,050\nSo it gives you everyone in there.\n\n1314\n01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:35,540\nThen there's other ones in\nthere that will do that too,\n\n1315\n01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,170\nto tell you if someone is there or not.\n\n1316\n01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:41,880\nBut the main ones would be verify,\nand expand.\n\n1317\n01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,320\nOnce you have those,\nyou can just walk through SMTP.\n\n1318\n01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,430\nAnd start interacting\nwith issuing these and\n\n1319\n01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:52,980\nstart essentially mapping\nout stuff in there.\n\n1320\n01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:55,700\nAnd it's really cool cause we're\ncutting to the point were we are, yeah,\n\n1321\n01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,250\nextracting user names,\nthat's what we do in enumeration.\n\n1322\n01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:01,530\n>> Absolutely, and that's gonna be\na key source of information, or\n\n1323\n01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:04,920\ninput, into our next phase which\nis that gaining access, right.\n\n1324\n01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,520\nThe user name is Half the battle.\n\n1325\n01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:10,140\nIf anything, user name and a password\ntypically to log on to most systems.\n\n1326\n01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:13,360\nAnd remember in like Windows, for\nexample, you've got two user names.\n\n1327\n01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:17,850\nYou've got your older name where\nif follows the DOMAIN\\UserName,\n\n1328\n01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:18,950\nthe old sAMAccountName.\n\n1329\n01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:21,180\nBut then you've got your UPN,\n\n1330\n01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,930\nyou User Principal Name,\nwhich is your email address.\n\n1331\n01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:28,910\nAnd, and most people don't realize this,\nwhen you go to a modern\n\n1332\n01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:34,920\nsystem it still asks you for in the format\nof the pre Windows 2000 format.\n\n1333\n01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,410\nBut you can go to a name dialogue box and\n\n1334\n01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:43,110\nyou can type in mike@itprotv.com and\nI can login with that.\n\n1335\n01:11:43,110 --> 01:11:45,560\nSo by getting these email\naddresses you're getting a bunch.\n\n1336\n01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,880\nYou're getting potentially their user\nname that you can just log on with.\n\n1337\n01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,169\nYou're getting names I can\nthen use to name drop.\n\n1338\n01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:54,840\nI'm getting sources for\nsocial engineering.\n\n1339\n01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,201\nIt may not seem like much,\nbut that's some juicy info.\n\n1340\n01:12:00,201 --> 01:12:04,948\n>> Yeah, absolutely you're getting\na lot of information at this\n\n1341\n01:12:04,948 --> 01:12:08,979\npoint by being able to do that,\nand as you mentioned,\n\n1342\n01:12:08,979 --> 01:12:14,430\nI liked the fact that you mentioned\nyou still log in and can use that.\n\n1343\n01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:19,050\nIf you get an email address,\non a lot of networks,\n\n1344\n01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:20,825\nyou actually have\nsomeone's username there.\n\n1345\n01:12:20,825 --> 01:12:21,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1346\n01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:25,510\n>> So if you're really reading\ninto it the right way,\n\n1347\n01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:29,020\nwhich is great that you pointed that out,\nyeah, you're getting those usernames.\n\n1348\n01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:31,840\nAll you have to do now is get\na password to go with it.\n\n1349\n01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,690\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1350\n01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:37,830\nNow keep in mind as an administrator,\nthey can change the DNS suffix on a UPN,\n\n1351\n01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,650\nso it's not guaranteed that it\nmatches their email address,\n\n1352\n01:12:40,650 --> 01:12:45,340\nbut most places don't do that, unless\nthey've got a really heavily domain forest\n\n1353\n01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,860\nwhere they end up with these\nreally long email addresses.\n\n1354\n01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,375\nThey might shorten that up for the log on.\n\n1355\n01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:52,460\nBut even that wouldn't be too hard to\nfigure out if you just started dropping\n\n1356\n01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,340\noff some of those domain components.\n\n1357\n01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,810\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1358\n01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:59,210\nWe're really getting down to the nuts and\nbolts now.\n\n1359\n01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:02,598\nWe haven't penetrated the system,\nbut we're winding up and\n\n1360\n01:13:02,598 --> 01:13:04,042\ngetting ready to do that.\n\n1361\n01:13:04,042 --> 01:13:04,762\n>> We're drilling.\n\n1362\n01:13:04,762 --> 01:13:06,724\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, definitely.\n\n1363\n01:13:06,724 --> 01:13:11,252\nSo when you have SMTP,\nI guess we should really talk about,\n\n1364\n01:13:11,252 --> 01:13:14,120\nhow do you defend against that?\n\n1365\n01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,250\nAnd I also like what\nJames mentioned on here.\n\n1366\n01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:20,070\nThere's another little thing that\nwe have called banner grabbing and\n\n1367\n01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:22,130\nthat's what Telnet could\nactually help you with too.\n\n1368\n01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:25,710\nYou could attach to\na system name in any port.\n\n1369\n01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:29,650\nYou could swap out port\n25 with port 80 and\n\n1370\n01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:33,600\nget information on the web server\nthat's running there, if it exists.\n\n1371\n01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:38,130\nIf you did a port scan and found that that\nport's open, now you can do a banner grab\n\n1372\n01:13:38,130 --> 01:13:41,730\nagainst it and see well,\nwhat actually is running there?\n\n1373\n01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,140\nAs James mentioned in here,\n\n1374\n01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:50,500\nyou can actually get information and\ncatch information on a mail server.\n\n1375\n01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:51,950\nSo, yeah.\n\n1376\n01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:54,614\nThanks for bringing that up, James,\n\n1377\n01:13:54,614 --> 01:13:58,788\nbecause that's just another\npiece you can put on the pile.\n\n1378\n01:13:58,788 --> 01:14:02,775\nBecause now you've got information where\nyou can start attacking that, too.\n\n1379\n01:14:02,775 --> 01:14:03,797\n>> Right, absolutely.\n\n1380\n01:14:03,797 --> 01:14:07,430\nSo SMTP, not just a mail protocol.\n\n1381\n01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:08,250\nRight?\n[LAUGH]\n\n1382\n01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:08,830\n>> Yeah.\n\n1383\n01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:12,980\nAnd the thing is that,\nwhat are you gonna tell a company?\n\n1384\n01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,460\nDon't use an SMTP server?\n\n1385\n01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:17,655\nOkay, what are they gonna do,\nmail everybody their stuff?\n\n1386\n01:14:17,655 --> 01:14:18,811\nAre you kidding me?\n>> Yeah,\n\n1387\n01:14:18,811 --> 01:14:22,820\nI mean most networks, many things\ncan go down and nobody notices.\n\n1388\n01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:27,690\nThat email system goes down for more than\nten seconds, then yeah, it's noticed.\n\n1389\n01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:30,950\n>> Yeah you'd think that you were\nsmothered with a pillow or something,\n\n1390\n01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:32,150\nlike I can't breathe.\n\n1391\n01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:33,580\nIt's email, man.\n\n1392\n01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:37,260\n>> Everybody wants to call you, hey,\ndo you know the email server's down?\n\n1393\n01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:38,370\nHey, do you know the email server's down?\n\n1394\n01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:39,900\nHey, do you know the email's, yeah.\n\n1395\n01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:42,430\n>> I particularly love it when\nsomeone's in one cubicle and\n\n1396\n01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:45,910\nthe person next to him and they're\ntrying to email the person next to him.\n\n1397\n01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:47,485\nI can't, how do I talk to this person?\n\n1398\n01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:49,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You could get up and walk over there.\n\n1399\n01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:51,205\nHave you tried that?\n\n1400\n01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:54,048\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They got this phone,\n\n1401\n01:14:54,048 --> 01:14:57,896\nit's not an earwax scoop,\nyou can call a person over there, too.\n\n1402\n01:14:57,896 --> 01:15:04,820\nThey just don't figure it out, so, yeah,\nyou could be very disruptive with this.\n\n1403\n01:15:04,820 --> 01:15:08,680\nNow probably one of the bigger defenses on\nit would be is not to make an open SMTP\n\n1404\n01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:13,210\nrelay, and\nthat's something that's a big no-no.\n\n1405\n01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:16,050\nYeah, they do exist but\nyou shouldn't be hosting one.\n\n1406\n01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:20,890\nYour SMTP relay should be for\nyour use, not for the public's use.\n\n1407\n01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:23,239\n>> Otherwise you'll find yourself\non a black list really quick.\n\n1408\n01:15:23,239 --> 01:15:24,609\n>> I'm glad you mentioned that one, too.\n\n1409\n01:15:24,609 --> 01:15:26,488\n>> And then none of your\nemails will ever be delivered.\n\n1410\n01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:29,130\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so.\n>> Yeah, you could find yourself in a lot\n\n1411\n01:15:29,130 --> 01:15:33,710\nof nastiness really quick by\nleaving an SMTP relay open.\n\n1412\n01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:35,170\nLike he said, a black list.\n\n1413\n01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:37,600\nI actually had a friend\nthat that happened to.\n\n1414\n01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,750\n>> They're not easy to get\noff of once you get on them.\n\n1415\n01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:40,370\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1416\n01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:43,840\nIt took a lot of effort for\nhim to get off of it.\n\n1417\n01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,315\nWell, he's an ex Navy Seal, so\nstubbornness is his nature.\n\n1418\n01:15:48,315 --> 01:15:49,555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It will happen.\n\n1419\n01:15:49,555 --> 01:15:55,280\n[LAUGH]\nSo in any case, there you go with SMTP.\n\n1420\n01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:59,300\n>> DNS, then, is probably the next\none we should talk about.\n\n1421\n01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:03,130\nI know we've talked a little bit\nabout DNS in our previous episodes.\n\n1422\n01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:07,280\nBut let's talk about it in\nrespect to enumeration.\n\n1423\n01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,650\nSo we won't have to remember,\nyou guys remember what it is, right?\n\n1424\n01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:13,180\nIt's our name, resolution protocol,\nmapping, FQDNs,\n\n1425\n01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:18,090\nFully Qualified Domain Names, back to IP\naddresses, which kinda gives you a good\n\n1426\n01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:22,680\nidea of what we might be able to\nenumerate if we are talking about DNS.\n\n1427\n01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:23,840\n>> Yeah.\nThat's where\n\n1428\n01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,180\nwe're headed is that you have DNS.\n\n1429\n01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:28,280\nAnd we know what DNS does.\n\n1430\n01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:34,590\nYou know already that it does is name\nresolution so, okay, we've got that down.\n\n1431\n01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:39,120\nWe also know that it's a database\ncontaining all of this,\n\n1432\n01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,362\nit can queried and all that good stuff.\n\n1433\n01:16:42,362 --> 01:16:45,210\nThe enumeration we're talking about now,\nlike we said\n\n1434\n01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:49,450\nwhen we started this whole thing on\nenumeration, we talked about usernames,\n\n1435\n01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:54,450\nGroup names, share names, and\nthen there's machine names.\n\n1436\n01:16:54,450 --> 01:16:58,720\nOkay?\nSo that's where DNS comes in, enumeration.\n\n1437\n01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:03,755\nThe big one we have here\nis doing enumeration\n\n1438\n01:17:03,755 --> 01:17:08,740\nthrough NSlookup, doing his own transfer.\n\n1439\n01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:12,748\nAnd if you recall,\nwe already talked about that previously.\n\n1440\n01:17:12,748 --> 01:17:17,600\nBut really, it's just a case of doing\nNSlookup, targeting a specific server and\n\n1441\n01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:24,500\ndoing the LS space minus D towards that\nserver and see if they'll transfer a zone.\n\n1442\n01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:28,110\nNow, here's the thing is how do\nyou do know if that's gonna work?\n\n1443\n01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:31,310\nWell, there's some criteria\nyou gotta meet first.\n\n1444\n01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:36,140\nYeah, you could just run that command and\nsay, oh, it works or it doesn't.\n\n1445\n01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:39,940\nBut it's probably a good idea to know,\nget an idea if it's gonna work or\n\n1446\n01:17:39,940 --> 01:17:41,640\nnot before you go in.\n\n1447\n01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:45,830\nOne of the indicators that\nyou're gonna do this is if\n\n1448\n01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:50,145\nyou do a port scan against the system and\nyou find out that port 53 is open.\n\n1449\n01:17:50,145 --> 01:17:57,422\nOkay, but it's just not port 53 that\nhas to be open, it's port 53 TCP.\n\n1450\n01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:59,873\nYou know,\nthat's the one that has to be open.\n\n1451\n01:17:59,873 --> 01:18:03,617\nIf it's port 53 UDP,\nthat is used for queries,\n\n1452\n01:18:03,617 --> 01:18:09,020\ncuz queries don't require all\nthese acknowledgements to happen.\n\n1453\n01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:13,240\nA zone transfer does, cuz a zone, you\nwant to make sure that gets there intact,\n\n1454\n01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:14,469\nthere has to be those acknowledgments.\n\n1455\n01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:21,330\nSo if port 53 TCP is open,\nthat means the door is open for\n\n1456\n01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:25,020\nyou to potentially, and\nthat's important, to potentially be able\n\n1457\n01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:31,670\nto do his own transfer.\n\n1458\n01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:35,790\nWhat you're gonna do at that point is,\nonce you find port 53 TCP open,\n\n1459\n01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:41,312\nis do that NSlookup ls minus d and\nsee what happens at that point.\n\n1460\n01:18:41,312 --> 01:18:45,110\nI'm just not gonna run it\nunless I see 53 TCP open.\n\n1461\n01:18:45,110 --> 01:18:48,390\nOnce I've done that, yeah,\nyou might be successful, but\n\n1462\n01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:53,620\nthen again as we were mentioning here,\nis that someone could very well\n\n1463\n01:18:53,620 --> 01:18:58,960\nhave been smart enough, or to leave\nthe defaults in place in this case,\n\n1464\n01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:03,880\nor to switch the defaults over saying,\ndon't transfer the zone\n\n1465\n01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:08,271\nto accept the people that are authorized\nto get it, in which case you won't get it.\n\n1466\n01:19:08,271 --> 01:19:11,260\nIt's gonna deny you access.\n\n1467\n01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:16,400\nAnd by default, most of modern DNS\nservers will say only to authorize\n\n1468\n01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:21,130\npeople or only to people that\nthe system administrator specifies.\n\n1469\n01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:23,760\nAnd if you're not on that list,\nit won't go.\n\n1470\n01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,800\nNow, in Windows 2000,\njust to talk with the Microsoft side,\n\n1471\n01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:31,010\nWindows 2000,\nit was very promiscuous in that sense.\n\n1472\n01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:33,350\nIf you ask, you shall receive.\n\n1473\n01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:34,770\nThat's just the way it was.\n\n1474\n01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:40,258\nAnd it would also seem like, well,\nif you had a Windows 2000 system and\n\n1475\n01:19:40,258 --> 01:19:45,200\nfound that, you were able to figure out\nthat's what that was in Windows 2000.\n\n1476\n01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,317\nIf you can do it there, great, but\n\n1477\n01:19:47,317 --> 01:19:51,861\nprobably not going to be able\nto do it in 2003, 2008, 2012.\n\n1478\n01:19:51,861 --> 01:19:56,218\nThat's true if you have a default\ninstallation, or not a default, but\n\n1479\n01:19:56,218 --> 01:20:00,080\na brand new installation of 2003,\n2008, 2012.\n\n1480\n01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:05,890\nOr someone has audited everything to\nmake sure the settings are correct,\n\n1481\n01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:10,130\nbut if someone has upgraded from Windows\n2000 hasn't done that verification,\n\n1482\n01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:13,330\nthose settings could still be in place,\ncause remember what an upgrade does, and\n\n1483\n01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,680\nupgrade retains the settings\nof the previous version.\n\n1484\n01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:19,000\nSo it very well could have\nbrought those settings up.\n\n1485\n01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,010\nSo you might find a 2008 system or\na 2012 system\n\n1486\n01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:27,200\nthat you can do this little magic and\nget the zone file to transfer to you.\n\n1487\n01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,000\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1488\n01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,230\nAnd that's just a lazy admin,\nnot necessarily a lazy admin, it's just.\n\n1489\n01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:35,770\nMaybe not fully understanding what's\ngoing on as they're doing that upgrade.\n\n1490\n01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:40,160\nOr failing to go back in and harden that\nserver after they've done the upgrade.\n\n1491\n01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:42,730\nAnd look at those default settings,\nand make sure they've changed them,\n\n1492\n01:20:42,730 --> 01:20:47,900\nso we can take advantage of\nthat in our enumeration phase.\n\n1493\n01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:50,570\n>> Yeah.\nIt's worth mentioning also that,\n\n1494\n01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:53,540\nwhy we're talking about\nNS Lookup to do a zone transfer.\n\n1495\n01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:57,880\nThere is another tool out there that's\nknown for doing zone transfers.\n\n1496\n01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,125\nAnd that is one called,\nan old school one called Sam Spade.\n\n1497\n01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:03,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It hasn't been upgraded in years.\n\n1498\n01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,418\nBut it is still out there.\n\n1499\n01:21:06,418 --> 01:21:11,700\nI downloaded it the other day to check and\n\n1500\n01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,230\nit's still there, still alive and kicking.\n\n1501\n01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:17,920\nSo you can do a zone transfer\nto that too if you feel\n\n1502\n01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,440\nlike you don't want to type\nin NS look up commands.\n\n1503\n01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:24,730\nI'll tell you that the NS lookup commands\nare more than likely ones you're gonna be\n\n1504\n01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:31,260\nquizzed on, but Sam Spade will also\ndo that for you in the field as well.\n\n1505\n01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,698\n>> Forgotten fruit, Michael says, I just\nlove the name Sam Spade, I mean come on.\n\n1506\n01:21:34,698 --> 01:21:36,970\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, that was a good one.\n\n1507\n01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:38,440\nThat was creative.\n\n1508\n01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,620\nSo, you know, in the end-\n>> Do you know where they got that from?\n\n1509\n01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:42,250\n>> What's that?\nThe old Maltese falcon, right?\n\n1510\n01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,810\n>> Yeah, I was looking it up.\n\n1511\n01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:44,700\nI knew it was a detective.\n\n1512\n01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,730\nI didn't know it was like 1930s stuff.\n\n1513\n01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:47,248\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1514\n01:21:47,248 --> 01:21:50,650\nThat's good stuff.\n\n1515\n01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:54,660\nWe've really gone over a lot of\ninformation there, with the enumeration,\n\n1516\n01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:58,430\na lot of different tools, they're not\nreally tools, but a lot of different\n\n1517\n01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:02,430\nplaces we can go and look to get\ndifferent types of information, list of,\n\n1518\n01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:05,270\nas you were saying earlier, all\nthe different things we want to enumerate.\n\n1519\n01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:10,320\nListing out user names, listing out\ngroups, listing out machine names.\n\n1520\n01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:14,550\nListing out IP addresses,\nall kinds of good information.\n\n1521\n01:22:14,550 --> 01:22:18,400\nSo when we look at this enumeration phase,\n\n1522\n01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:23,380\nwhich is gonna be the step right\nbefore the gaining access.\n\n1523\n01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:27,080\nAnd we've said a couple times,\ntalked about how the results of one phase\n\n1524\n01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:30,500\nIs then you're gonna be the output of that\nphase is gonna be used as the input for\n\n1525\n01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,570\nthe next phase.\n\n1526\n01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:34,770\nSo what kind of things in the end,\ntaking all of this into consideration,\n\n1527\n01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,080\nwhat should we have at\nthe end of our enumeration?\n\n1528\n01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:38,490\nOr what do, what would we desire?\n\n1529\n01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:40,211\nWhat would we want to have?\n\n1530\n01:22:40,211 --> 01:22:44,487\n>> You should have,\nit's ideally having usernames,\n\n1531\n01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:47,510\na good list of user names, at least.\n\n1532\n01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:48,640\nI shouldn't say complete, but\n\n1533\n01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:53,320\nhaving a good list of user names\nto go after is gonna help you.\n\n1534\n01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,970\nHaving a good list of hosts and\n\n1535\n01:22:55,970 --> 01:23:00,470\ncomputers that you can potentially\ngo after and target are a good step.\n\n1536\n01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:02,750\nGroups, if you can get them, is good.\n\n1537\n01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:06,530\nThose are all really kind of great things,\n\n1538\n01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:09,560\nand then anything else\nyou can add on to that.\n\n1539\n01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:13,470\nMainly for me, user names,\nmachine names are great, and\n\n1540\n01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:16,470\nanything else on that is\njust icing on the cake.\n\n1541\n01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:18,740\n>> Oh and shares,\nI forgot about shares being on the list.\n\n1542\n01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:22,560\n>> And shares, shares are not a bad\nthing to actually have as well.\n\n1543\n01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:27,310\n>> Like I said as long as I have those\ntwo core ones I feel pretty good,\n\n1544\n01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:30,870\nthe other stuff just adds onto it,\ngives me more stuff to explore.\n\n1545\n01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:35,280\nMore is always better, but\nif I've set the goals for that phase and\n\n1546\n01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,990\nI wanna at least get those.\n\n1547\n01:23:36,990 --> 01:23:40,950\nIf I can get those and still have\nin my mind enough time or whatever,\n\n1548\n01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:45,810\ntry it out,\nI'm gonna go after the other ones too.\n\n1549\n01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:48,400\nWhether you adopt that policy or\nnot, up to you.\n\n1550\n01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,120\nThat's the way I do it.\n\n1551\n01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,920\nSet those goals and then it's like,\nokay I've got enough time.\n\n1552\n01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:59,000\nLet me go after and get all this\nother stuff wherever possible.\n\n1553\n01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:05,520\nAnd it's also, to add onto this, there's\na term for what we're talking about,\n\n1554\n01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:10,600\nbringing stuff from one phase to another,\nto another and having one action\n\n1555\n01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:15,490\nfollow acting on the results of another\naction and then so on so forth.\n\n1556\n01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,880\nThe term they call that is daisy chaining.\n\n1557\n01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,680\nWe know daisy chaining from sticking stuff\nfrom sticking stuff in the back of our\n\n1558\n01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,180\ncomputer and\nmaking that big long thing and everything.\n\n1559\n01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:29,140\nSame deal here is that daisy chaining\nmeans when you carry out one thing,\n\n1560\n01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:33,090\nstuff comes out as output on that step or\nphase.\n\n1561\n01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:37,680\nAnd then that stuff goes and is input in\nthe next phase and then it goes output and\n\n1562\n01:24:37,680 --> 01:24:41,370\nright on through, so something acts\non the results of something else.\n\n1563\n01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:42,481\n>> Very good.\nVery good.\n\n1564\n01:24:42,481 --> 01:24:44,990\nAll right,\na lot of good information there.\n\n1565\n01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:47,059\nAnything else we wanna\nthrow into our enumeration?\n\n1566\n01:24:48,790 --> 01:24:55,480\n>> Enumeration, it's, again, be patient\nwith what you're doing with enumeration.\n\n1567\n01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,720\nThere's some good information\nyou can get here.\n\n1568\n01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,400\nSometimes it can be rather frustrating.\n\n1569\n01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,560\nBut, be prepared for that.\n\n1570\n01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:07,300\nYou may have to try several approaches\nbefore you get those user names.\n\n1571\n01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:10,580\nYou may have to try several approaches\nbefore you get those machine names.\n\n1572\n01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:14,990\nHeck, you might already have machine IP\naddress names if you've been lucky and\n\n1573\n01:25:14,990 --> 01:25:18,680\nsomebody's doing their homework\non the other side, heck,\n\n1574\n01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:21,110\nyou may already have that.\n\n1575\n01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:24,970\nSo take your time,\ntry different approaches.\n\n1576\n01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:28,590\nAnd as was asked in our\ndiscussion groups here,\n\n1577\n01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:32,610\nthese are only six of the protocols\nthat can potentially be exploited.\n\n1578\n01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:34,020\nYou could find others.\n\n1579\n01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:39,660\nYou look at things like SNAP/g] and\nSMTP for example, and DNS.\n\n1580\n01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,820\nThose things were not built to be secure.\n\n1581\n01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:42,630\nWe've said that before.\n\n1582\n01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:45,580\nThey were definitely not built to be\nsecure when they were envisioned.\n\n1583\n01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:50,980\nNow that means that you potentially can\nexploit stuff like FTP to get usernames,\n\n1584\n01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:52,630\nwhich wasn't mentioned here.\n\n1585\n01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:55,395\nIts time is coming up later in the course,\ndon't worry.\n\n1586\n01:25:55,395 --> 01:25:57,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But there's other ones.\n\n1587\n01:25:57,170 --> 01:26:00,790\nYou know,\nyou've got stuff like POP potentially.\n\n1588\n01:26:00,790 --> 01:26:05,630\nAnd you would add on the data a list\nof sweet protocols and TCP/IP.\n\n1589\n01:26:05,630 --> 01:26:07,470\nThere's a lot of them out there.\n\n1590\n01:26:07,470 --> 01:26:10,800\nSo you can take the knowledge\nthat you learned here.\n\n1591\n01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,140\nThat there should be stuff being\nswapped and exchanged there and\n\n1592\n01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:17,190\njust carry it forward and find the tools\nappropriate for those protocols.\n\n1593\n01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,300\n>> All right, very good.\n\n1594\n01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:23,410\nSo a lot of information there,\ntalked a lot about numeration, what it is.\n\n1595\n01:26:23,410 --> 01:26:26,560\nAnd some examples of some of the different\nways we can start listing out that\n\n1596\n01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,990\ninformation that we want to take\nwith us into that next phase.\n\n1597\n01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:33,600\nSo that pretty much does it for\nour time today.\n\n1598\n01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,500\nWe're going to go ahead and call it here.\n\n1599\n01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,270\nRemember, ladies and gentlemen, if you've\ngot questions while you're watching

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:37,960\nWelcome to another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,820\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:41,550\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,750\n>> I'm feeling pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,350\n>> Are you?\n>> Yeah, they say you are what you eat,\n\n10\n00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,642\nI feel like I ate a big\nbowl of awesome today.\n\n11\n00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:51,790\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] That's what I like to hear.\n\n12\n00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,390\nIt is Friday for us for\nthe live recording,\n\n13\n00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,050\nwe're gonna have some fun today,\nguys and gals.\n\n14\n00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,270\nWe are moving on through\nour hacking lifecycle.\n\n15\n00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,910\nAnd in the previous episodes, if you\nmissed them, make sure you go back and\n\n16\n00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,150\nwatch them, they are good.\n\n17\n00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,350\nWe did footprinting as our first phase.\n\n18\n00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,230\nAnd then we took the output of that\nfirst phase from footprinting and\n\n19\n00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,820\nwe brought it into our scanning phase.\n\n20\n00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,670\nAnd then after our scanning phase,\nwe took that information\n\n21\n00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,520\ntook it with us into the third phase,\nwhich was our enumeration phase,\n\n22\n00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,930\nwhere we started listing out resources\nthat we could actually get access too.\n\n23\n00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,400\nAnd then, this next phase is\ncalled gaining access, so.\n\n24\n00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,220\nSean's book, that's gonna be chapter seven\nif you're following along in the book.\n\n25\n00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,390\nAnd everyone should have that book by now,\nright?\n\n26\n00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,560\nOr if you're waiting to get one.\n\n27\n00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,700\nCEH, certified ethical hacker.\n\n28\n00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,900\n>> Yeah, what's going on people?\n\n29\n00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,455\nBuy the thing.\n\n30\n00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:42,430\n[LAUGH]\n>> Certified ethical hacker version 8\n\n31\n00:01:42,430 -->

00:01:50,430\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n34\n00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,780\n>> Get an electronic version\nof that if you want to, but.\n\n35\n00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,370\nSo if you're following along in the book\nthat is going to be chapter seven,\n\n36\n00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,619\ngaining access to a system.\n\n37\n00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,430\n>> And we're working on getting a version\nread by Morgan Freeman pretty soon.\n\n38\n00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,366\n>> Nice.\n\n39\n00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:07,060\n[LAUGH] Or our in-house Morgan Freeman\nimpersonator that we have over there.\n\n40\n00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,010\n>> Morgan Freeman Junior.\n\n41\n00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n42\n00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,359\nNotice [LAUGH] Dan.\n\n43\n00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:14,000\nAll right so gaining access to a system.\n\n44\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,610\nAs I said we've gone through\nthe other phases kinda\n\n45\n00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,900\nworking through that attack phase.\n\n46\n00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,260\nAt this point in our phase we've done\nall of our information gathering,\n\n47\n00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,396\nall of our reconnaissance.\n\n48\n00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:26,480\nWe've done our initial scanning to try to\nsee what's out there, what we can get.\n\n49\n00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,640\nYou know live hosts,\nthings like that, we took that in,\n\n50\n00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,100\nwe started enumerating what we could.\n\n51\n00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,390\nUser names maybe, group memberships,\nshared folders, computer names,\n\n52\n00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,520\nall of that good stuff, and\nour next phase then is this attack phase.\n\n53\n00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,990\nSo, when they talk about gaining access\nto the system what do they really mean.\n\n54\n00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,010\nWhat is gaining access?\n\n55\n00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:53,440\n>> Well gaining access,\nthe name kinda says it all, but\n\n56\n00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,930\nit's important for us kinda to make sure\nwe really understand what that means.\n\n57\n00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,010\nWhere yes,\nwe are gaining access to the system.\n\n58\n00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,180\nOne of the things I always try\nto stress after doing this for\n\n59\n00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,420\nso long is that when people\nsee the different phases,\n\n60\n00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,770\nthey see numeration and\nnow I gained access, I'm in the system.\n\n61\n00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,180\nThey're all happy about it.\n\n62\n00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,990\nWhat I like to say is that there's no\neureka moment where you're in the system,\n\n63\n00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,310\nyou take full control over it,\nthat very rarely happens.\n\n64\n00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,220\nWhen you get to this phase,\nIt's a sequence of little\n\n65\n00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,910\nsubsteps inside of it where you're\ngaining increased amounts of access.\n\n66\n00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,680\nIt's like of like\ntunnelling under the wall.\n\n67\n00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,410\nIt's not like you're on one side of\nthe wall and then bang you're over here.\n\n68\n00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,980\nYou slowly gotta tunnel\nunder to get in and\n\n69\n00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,090\nyou're gaining increased\namounts of access.\n\n70\n00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,440\nSo, remember that, there's no point\nwhere you are on one side and\n\n71\n00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,280\nthen you're all the way in and\ngot complete control and\n\n72\n00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,890\nyou own the whole system, that just\nvery rarely happens, it can happen.\n\n73\n00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,920\nBut it's very, very rare.\n\n74\n00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,550\n>> Cause technically when\nwe did our numeration we\n\n75\n00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,580\nkind of had to gain access a little\nbit there to get that information.\n\n76\n00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,740\n>> Yeah and\ntechnically even though yeah you're right.\n\n77\n00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,400\nWe are getting some access we're\nkind of peaking in at that point.\n\n78\n00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,410\nAnd just reaching in through the fence so\nto speak.\n\n79\n00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,600\n>> Right.\n[CROSSTALK] Exactly,\n\n80\n00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,671\nreaching our arms through the chain\nlink fence trying to get stuff.\n\n81\n00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:24,480\nBut we're not quite in.\n\n82\n00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,620\nSo what we're doing here is we're actually\n\n83\n00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,820\nare really trying to\ngain full access to it.\n\n84\n00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,930\nThat's our ultimate goal.\n\n85\n00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,720\nNow when you look at it in context\nthat gradual kind of tunneling in or\n\n86\n00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240\ndigging our way amounts to that we\n\n87\n00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,230\ncompromise a local system and\nget greater and greater access there.\n\n88\n00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,800\nThen once we compromise that local system,\nwe can use that to start doing\n\n89\n00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,730\nthings to start getting\naccess to the network proper.\n\n90\n00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,120\nYou're probably not gonna\njump right in and get access,\n\n91\n00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,940\nfull access to the network,\nown everything.\n\n92\n00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,020\nYou're going to compromise and local\nsystem and then try to get that access\n\n93\n00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,530\nwhere you can start launching strikes into\nthe main networking gain access there.\n\n94\n00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,350\n>> Nice, nice.\nOnce we get that access to that system,\n\n95\n00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,630\nthen we can take advantage of\nWhat access that system has,\n\n96\n00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,720\nor if we've compromised a user account.\n\n97\n00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,350\nNow we can try to gain, we have\nthe same access that that user has.\n\n98\n00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,460\nSo whatever it may be.\n\n99\n00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,620\nIf it's a local account,\nwe've now got access to the local system.\n\n100\n00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,720\nAnd then from there we can try to work our\nway out, get access to a domain account or\n\n101\n00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,630\nto reach out and\ntouch some other machines on the network.\n\n102\n00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,600\nThings like that.\n\n103\n00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,430\nVery good.\n\n104\n00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,490\nAll right, so\nwe know what gaining access means.\n\n105\n00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,230\nAnd again, as Sean said, it's not a eureka\nmoment like one site you don't have any\n\n106\n00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,670\naccess, one minute you\ndon't have any access.\n\n107\n00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,420\nThen all of a sudden you've got full\naccess to everything on the network.\n\n108\n00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,620\nIt's a gradual process,\nan escalation process.\n\n109\n00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:52,420\nSo what would be our first step in\nattempting to gain this access.\n\n110\n00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,510\n>> That's the thing to\nremember is that yeah,\n\n111\n00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,380\nthere are several things\nthat can take place.\n\n112\n00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:03,100\nWe're gonna give you a look during\nthis whole step of gaining access.\n\n113\n00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,330\nWe're gonna show you that yes,\nthere's a lot of things happening.\n\n114\n00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,530\nBut there are some things that people\ntend to do, and I like to emphasize that,\n\n115\n00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,110\ntend to do first.\n\n116\n00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,950\nYou don't have to do this first.\n\n117\n00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,230\nBut let's look at what we\ndid in the numeration.\n\n118\n00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,210\nYou just mentioned it, Mike.\n\n119\n00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,730\nWe got user names.\n\n120\n00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,620\nThat was one of the things\nwe really wanted.\n\n121\n00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,640\nI emphasized it yesterday.\n\n122\n00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,550\nOne of your goals should\nbe that you are able to,\n\n123\n00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,455\nat the very least,\nHave user names and machine names.\n\n124\n00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:32,535\nIf you get more, icing on the cake.\n\n125\n00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:35,055\nBut we wanna at least have those.\n\n126\n00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:39,795\nNow, once we have those, the next step is\nseeing, okay, we've got the user accounts.\n\n127\n00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,635\nLet's see if we can\ncrack some of those and\n\n128\n00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,845\nsee if we can get the passwords for those.\n\n129\n00:06:43,845 --> 00:06:48,995\nSo typically it's not uncommon to\ntry cracking some passwords as our\n\n130\n00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:51,260\nfirst step in gaining access.\n\n131\n00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,780\n>> That seems like a logical next step.\n\n132\n00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,390\nCuz we know to authenticate,\nin a password based system,\n\n133\n00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,170\nthere's really two pieces I need.\n\n134\n00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,210\nRight?\nThe username and the password.\n\n135\n00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,460\nIf we were successful and met our goals\nin our enumeration phase, as Sean said,\n\n136\n00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,235\nwe've got the username part of it.\n\n137\n00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:05,295\nWe just need the password.\n\n138\n00:07:05,295 --> 00:07:05,795\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> So,\n\n139\n00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:10,025\nseveral different techniques we can go\nabout trying to access that password or\n\n140\n00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:14,905\nto break that password depending on what\ntype of account it is I suppose, and\n\n141\n00:07:14,905 --> 00:07:16,412\nwhere that account is being.\n\n142\n00:07:16,412 --> 00:07:17,112\nStored so\n\n143\n00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:20,822\nlet's take a look at some of the options\nwe have for doing some password cracking.\n\n144\n00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,867\n>> Yeah, plenty of options,\nplenty of options.\n\n145\n00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:26,312\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This whole idea of password cracking\n\n146\n00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:29,851\njust being that,\ncracking passwords and that's it.\n\n147\n00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:35,421\nThat's why the conception\nthere is correct.\n\n148\n00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:40,451\nThere's really many, many, many, many\ndifferent shades of password cracking, so\n\n149\n00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:42,780\nwe do need to discuss what those are.\n\n150\n00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,500\nAnd then delve into each one so\n\n151\n00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,130\nyou understand that you're not just going\ndoing one simple thing to break passwords.\n\n152\n00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,088\nIt's all in your approach and\nhow much noise you want to make and\n\n153\n00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:57,083\njust what the environment\nlends itself out to.\n\n154\n00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:01,577\n>> Right, exactly cuz depending on\nwhere that account is stored and\n\n155\n00:08:01,577 --> 00:08:04,845\nthat password is stored\nmight change the tool or\n\n156\n00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:08,208\nthe method you use to try\nto break that password.\n\n157\n00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:12,250\nAnd as you say, we don't want to obviously\nalert the network that we're doing that,\n\n158\n00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,690\nwe've got lock out policies to worry\nabout and all kinds of fun stuff.\n\n159\n00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,080\nSo, let's dive in.\n\n160\n00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,780\nLet's see.\nSo\n\n161\n00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,510\nwhat's one of our first methods we\ncan do with our password cracking.\n\n162\n00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,390\n>> Yeah.\nLet's talk about our first one, and\n\n163\n00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,370\nremember, there's four different\ncategories you can really look at.\n\n164\n00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:33,630\nWe have passive online, active online,\noffline, and non-electronic, okay?\n\n165\n00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,015\n>> All right.\n>> In no particular order.\n\n166\n00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,370\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n167\n00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,870\nlet's look at the first difference, then.\n\n168\n00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,180\nOnline versus offline.\n\n169\n00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,190\nWhat do we mean by that?\n\n170\n00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,930\nYeah, good place to start.\n\n171\n00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,760\nWhen you talk about online versus offline.\n\n172\n00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,690\nEasy way to look at is\nwhen you're online you\n\n173\n00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,870\nare directly interacting with a system.\n\n174\n00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,010\nThat's the easiest cut and\ndry way to look at it.\n\n175\n00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,200\nOffline.\n\n176\n00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,960\nYou are not interacting\nwith the system directly.\n\n177\n00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,470\nYou will at some point, but\nas we'll see, it's a little different\n\n178\n00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,170\nthan actively engaging it and\ndoing that in an online manner.\n\n179\n00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,480\nSo online, I might actually be looking\nat a dialogue box, and authentication\n\n180\n00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,230\ndialogue box, where I've got to type in\na user name and password and hit enter.\n\n181\n00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,680\nOr go on a webpage form, or\n\n182\n00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,570\nan authentication dialogue box on\na Windows system or something like that.\n\n183\n00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,950\nWhere I'm actually dealing with\nthe system, putting in my guess or\n\n184\n00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,540\nwhatever tool I'm using, and\nthen submitting that and see if it works.\n\n185\n00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,850\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n186\n00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,380\nIt very well could be that.\n\n187\n00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,190\nI mean, the way you're kind of\ntalking about it would be what\n\n188\n00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,170\nwe consider a brute force attack.\n\n189\n00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,990\nThat would definitely be\nan active online attack.\n\n190\n00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,710\n>> Ok.\n>> But we do have those passive ones too.\n\n191\n00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,510\nLet's start there.\n\n192\n00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,210\n>> Yeah, let's go through a few so\nwe can kind of set the stage on that.\n\n193\n00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,870\n>> Okay.\n>> A passive online, so\n\n194\n00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,470\nyou are actively interacting\nwith the system.\n\n195\n00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,490\nExcept in a passive one,\nyou kind of got your head down.\n\n196\n00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,565\nA passive one,\nthey include things like sniffing.\n\n197\n00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:04,220\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know?\n\n198\n00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,500\nAnd we're gonna talk a bit\nabout sniffing here.\n\n199\n00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,980\nWe have a whole to do on sniffing that,\nthat we're gonna get into.\n\n200\n00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,470\nBut we do have to start\nintroducing that topic here.\n\n201\n00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,510\nSniffing just means that you are doing\nsomething to observe the credentials\n\n202\n00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,360\nas they move across the wire.\n\n203\n00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,450\nAnd I use wire generically.\n\n204\n00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,240\nWe could be doing this over wireless too.\n\n205\n00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,110\n>> So these aren't passwords that stink?\n\n206\n00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,500\nIs what you're saying.\n\n207\n00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,226\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n208\n00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:31,330\nAbsolutely.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,380\n>> Well who knows, they may stink,\n\n210\n00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,870\ndepends on people who are picking.\n\n211\n00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,290\n>> So in this case,\nwe're not actually trying to authenticate,\n\n212\n00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:39,890\nor typing in passwords.\n\n213\n00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,810\nWe'll letting the end user do their normal\nthing, or the system do it's normal thing.\n\n214\n00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,320\nWe're just kind of monitoring,\nsitting back,\n\n215\n00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,930\nand seeing what kind of information\nwe can glean by just observing.\n\n216\n00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,400\nSo is using or running some,\nlike you said,\n\n217\n00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,950\nsome kind of packet capture utility,\nand maybe I can.\n\n218\n00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,580\nWhen they go to authenticate and\nsubmit those credentials and\n\n219\n00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,110\nagainst that account database or\n\n220\n00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,520\nwherever it is that they store,\nthen can we capture that information?\n\n221\n00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,770\n>> Yes,\nthat's exactly what you're doing is.\n\n222\n00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,550\nYou let them conduct businesses normal.\n\n223\n00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,960\nWe've got our head down.\n\n224\n00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,690\nWe let them do whatever they normally do.\n\n225\n00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,170\nWe hope that during\ntheir normal activities,\n\n226\n00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:22,640\nwe can actually capture a credential or\ntwo and then use that to log in ourselves.\n\n227\n00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,210\nIt's really as simple as that.\n\n228\n00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,330\nThe thing is that you may be actually\nable to capture a credential,\n\n229\n00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,180\nyou could catch completely in the clear.\n\n230\n00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,840\nIf you do that, you're home free.\n\n231\n00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,390\nAnd remember,\nthat a lot of these protocols,\n\n232\n00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,980\nwe've talked about a lot of\nthese protocols all ready.\n\n233\n00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,980\nWell let's just focus on one, SMTP.\n\n234\n00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,920\nSMTP is not designed to be secure,\nwe've been down that road before,\n\n235\n00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,350\nit's just not designed to be secure.\n\n236\n00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,070\nIf someone hasn't take additional steps to\nwrap that up in any sort of encryption,\n\n237\n00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,250\nwhich is common now a days\nif you're using SNTP,\n\n238\n00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,430\nsince we do know credentials\nare going in there.\n\n239\n00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,760\nWe'll use something like SSL,\nor something,\n\n240\n00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,780\nto kind of provide that extra layer,\nthat wrapper to protect it.\n\n241\n00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,780\nBut, if someone's not doing that or being\na little careless, you can turn a sniffer\n\n242\n00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,950\nand pull those credentials right out,\nright off the wire and you're done.\n\n243\n00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know it's\n\n244\n00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,460\nreally is that simply if\nyou've never seen it.\n\n245\n00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,640\nSo if, if they're using some\ntype of plain text protocol and\n\n246\n00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,080\nas Shaw mentioned we know several, right?\n\n247\n00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,290\nSMTP, FTP is another big one,\n\n248\n00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,710\ntelnet's one that doesn't\nreally encrypt its credentials.\n\n249\n00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,870\nSo if they're using any one of those\nprotocols that sends its data plain text,\n\n250\n00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,040\nwe capture those packets, our job is done.\n\n251\n00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,710\nI can see the password right there\nin my packet capture utility.\n\n252\n00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,080\nSo now I've got everything I need and\nI'm good to go.\n\n253\n00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,690\nWhat if the information in\nthat packet is encrypted.\n\n254\n00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:53,400\nBut let's say they've gone and\ntaken a step to maybe run SSL or\n\n255\n00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,220\na VPN tunnel for that telnet connect or\nsomething like that.\n\n256\n00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,730\nDoes that mean that information\nwe capture it as useless?\n\n257\n00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,960\n>> Not necessarily.\n\n258\n00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,200\nThat's one of the interesting\nthings there is.\n\n259\n00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,990\nYes if it's in the clear and\nI might add, by the way,\n\n260\n00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,990\njust a little footnote to that,\nreally quickly, is that you, it's gonna\n\n261\n00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,930\nhelp you out tremendously to understand\nwhich protocol sends stuff in the clear.\n\n262\n00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,550\nAnd there are several.\n\n263\n00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,920\nI just use SMDP as an example,\nwe have FTP plus a few other ones.\n\n264\n00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,500\nBe prepared for that, because that's gonna\npay dividends when we get to sniffing and\n\n265\n00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,750\nstuff like that.\n\n266\n00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,010\nBut anyway.\n\n267\n00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,300\nIf it's encrypted one of the common\nways the encrypt it actually or\n\n268\n00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,940\ninclude encryptographic\ntechnology is by hashing.\n\n269\n00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,110\nLet's look at that one.\n\n270\n00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,190\nWe know what hashing is because we did\nour whole segment on it, our whole\n\n271\n00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:52,930\nepisode on encryption and we talked\nspecifically about what hashing does.\n\n272\n00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:58,280\nWe know that a hash doesn't tell you\nwhat the original information is,\n\n273\n00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,850\nit just gives you a fingerprint of it,\na unique fingerprint.\n\n274\n00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:06,850\nSo, what happens if someones\nusing an authentication mechanism\n\n275\n00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,272\nthat does do that, and that's not\nuncommon, that's definitely not uncommon.\n\n276\n00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:11,180\n>> All right.\n\n277\n00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:14,270\n>> So,\nwhat happens in those is that someone will\n\n278\n00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,200\ntype in a credential in their system and\nit will be hashed and\n\n279\n00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,670\nthen the hash will be transmitted across\nthe wire instead of the password.\n\n280\n00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,180\nIt's actually a pretty ingenious method,\nbecause it gives you a way,\n\n281\n00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,890\nas the receiver,\nto authenticate a password.\n\n282\n00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,760\nWithout actually seeing the password.\n\n283\n00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,230\n>> Right, so I never had to transmit my\nactual password across the network yet.\n\n284\n00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,370\nI can be verified because\nremember we talked about hashing.\n\n285\n00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,250\nIf you hash the same thing again and\n\n286\n00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,190\nagain its always gonna generate that\nsame message digest or that hash value.\n\n287\n00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,580\nSo, like in active directory and a lot of\nour different authentication protocols.\n\n288\n00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,010\nThey don't store your password they\nstore a hashed version of your password.\n\n289\n00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,330\nSo when you authenticate\nyou type in your user name.\n\n290\n00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,650\nIt hashes it using the same hashing\nalgorithm sends over the hash value and\n\n291\n00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,520\nthen it's just compared to what's\nstored in that identity store.\n\n292\n00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,030\nAnd if those values match then you\nmust of typed in the correct password.\n\n293\n00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,120\nIf you typed in anything else It\nshouldn't generate the same hash.\n\n294\n00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,890\nWith our asterisk out there, right,\ncuz we know about collisions, and\n\n295\n00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,600\nwe're gonna talk about\nit in a later episode.\n\n296\n00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,830\nBut in general, if I've typed in the right\npassword, those hash values should match.\n\n297\n00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,540\nSo that's really cool.\n\n298\n00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,440\nI can authenticate without ever sending\nmy password across the network.\n\n299\n00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,160\nBut if you capture that hash though,\n\n300\n00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,840\nthere's things you can do with that,\nright?\n\n301\n00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,170\n>> Yeah, the simplest thing you can do is\nyou can capture a hash, replay attack.\n\n302\n00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:35,010\nThat's basically having a sniffer,\nyou record the traffic,\n\n303\n00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,000\nand then you chatter it back at a system.\n\n304\n00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,030\nAnd it accepts it because\nthose are valid credentials.\n\n305\n00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,380\nThey are just hashed.\n\n306\n00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,070\n>> So you never even broke my password,\nyou didn't even care what my password is.\n\n307\n00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,950\nYou just waited until I authenticated,\ngrabbed my packet, and\n\n308\n00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,370\nthen you're gonna send it again later,\npretending you're me,\n\n309\n00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,850\nbasically impersonating me and\nthe system doesn't know any better.\n\n310\n00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,375\nIt sees well, the hash values match,\nyou must be me.\n\n311\n00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,708\n>> Yes.\nExactly.\n\n312\n00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,600\nWhen I have that fingerprint and\nit's [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n313\n00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,750\nI've captured that fingerprint I'm done,\nI don't need your password.\n\n314\n00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,458\nDon't care what your\npassword is at that point.\n\n315\n00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,950\nI have everything I need.\n\n316\n00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,660\nSo, unless you change your password, for\n\n317\n00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,850\nwhatever reason, to invalidate that hash,\nit's gonna keep working.\n\n318\n00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,810\nIn which case, if you change it,\nI can just recapture it again, presumably.\n\n319\n00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,060\nSo it's a very simple attack.\n\n320\n00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,080\nNow most modern systems will\nstart to defend against that,\n\n321\n00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,360\nexcept at the simplest level.\n\n322\n00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,200\nThey do that by doing\nthings like time-stamping.\n\n323\n00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,120\nSo, if I was to capture your hash, it's\nonly good for a limited period of time.\n\n324\n00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,820\n>> Yeah, we mentioned that yesterday.\n\n325\n00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,660\nI keep going back to Windows,\ncuz that's where a lot of my bread and\n\n326\n00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,190\nbutter has been.\n\n327\n00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,950\nBut, Windows for example, is five minutes.\n\n328\n00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,570\nThat's in a policy that can be changed,\nbut\n\n329\n00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,210\nif your time stamp is off by more than\nfive minutes with what that domain\n\n330\n00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,500\ncontroller things the time is,\nit's not gonna accept that packet or\n\n331\n00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,140\nthat authentication process\nbecause of this very thing.\n\n332\n00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,450\nIt could be a replay attack, so\nit's gonna fail your authentication.\n\n333\n00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:08,410\nSo that helps a little bit, but\nthere is that five minute window,\n\n334\n00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,720\nwhere you could have captured\nmy password as I logged in and\n\n335\n00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,750\nthen within that five minutes try to\ndo a replay and you might gain access.\n\n336\n00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,361\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n337\n00:17:16,361 --> 00:17:18,877\nAnd do remember, that five minute window,\n\n338\n00:17:18,877 --> 00:17:21,667\nyou're talking the world\nof Cerberus on there.\n\n339\n00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:23,035\nThat's the norm there.\n\n340\n00:17:23,035 --> 00:17:25,750\nSo, 100% correct there.\n\n341\n00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,850\nIf you move outside that world to stuff\nlike the remote access protocols where\n\n342\n00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,980\nCerberus doesn't play a role,\nsome of those do not use time stamping.\n\n343\n00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,180\nAnd that may be what you're starting.\n\n344\n00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're gaining access Cerberus would\n\n345\n00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,070\nbe if you are on the inside, and\nthen that would definitely come\n\n346\n00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,060\ninto play that you have to worry\nabout that, variance on the clock.\n\n347\n00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,090\nIf you're on the outside and trying to\ncompromise something, which you very\n\n348\n00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,830\nwell may be, you might be able to get\nsomething that's not time stamped,\n\n349\n00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,420\nbecause things like the challenge\nhandshake authentication protocol.\n\n350\n00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,670\nIs a good example of one that\ndoes use that method of hashing.\n\n351\n00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,700\nAnd in which case, you might be able\nto grab that and have it good for\n\n352\n00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,220\na period of time.\n\n353\n00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,660\nBut then again, if you use remote access,\nthey should be set up on VPN or\n\n354\n00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,780\nsomething like that.\n\n355\n00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,900\nAnd they probably are,\nbut don't take it as 100%.\n\n356\n00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,775\nSome people are still kind of lazy.\n\n357\n00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,715\nThe less than, doing that.\n\n358\n00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,239\n>> I've never done that, myself, no.\n\n359\n00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:24,094\n[LAUGH]\n>> Of course not.\n\n360\n00:18:24,094 --> 00:18:24,855\n>> But, yeah, that's true.\n\n361\n00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:27,615\nYou can't, there's no way to\nguarantee time synchronization\n\n362\n00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:29,195\nwith nodes outside of my network, right?\n\n363\n00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:32,470\nWhich are not a part of my domain as\nfar as a Windows environment goes.\n\n364\n00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,420\nSo we can't use that as a method to\nensure there's no replay attack, right?\n\n365\n00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,180\nBecause they're not part of my network,\n\n366\n00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:42,460\nI can't synchronize their clocks ahead\nof time or anything like that, so.\n\n367\n00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,450\n>> Something I think about.\n\n368\n00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,010\nThis is kind of where you have to\nthink outside the box on here a bit.\n\n369\n00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,930\nIt's not uncommon to have people at home\nthat experiment with this type of stuff,\n\n370\n00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,680\nand they might set up a remote\naccess system at home.\n\n371\n00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,040\nI've seen it where people play around,\nthey wanna dial up their system from home,\n\n372\n00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,660\nor connect to it from home.\n\n373\n00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,520\nOkay, fine.\n\n374\n00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,460\nThey wanna do that, but\nthey don't secure it well enough.\n\n375\n00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,860\nMaybe I can compromise a home system, and\nget into that, and plant something on it.\n\n376\n00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,150\nAnd then when they connect to their\nwork network, I can capture stuff.\n\n377\n00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,781\nSo remember,\nit may be getting that soft point there.\n\n378\n00:19:20,781 --> 00:19:21,405\n>> Absolutely.\n\n379\n00:19:21,405 --> 00:19:24,438\n>> As a bad guy, as a ethical hacker,\nI'm probably not gonna do that.\n\n380\n00:19:24,438 --> 00:19:25,280\nBut.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n381\n00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,960\n>> It's not out of the realm of a bad guy\n\n382\n00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,170\nto do it that doesn't have the same\nethics and challenges we do.\n\n383\n00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,660\n>> Absolutely as a security\nperson that becomes a big\n\n384\n00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,310\nissue that I have to deal with, with more\nand more remote access from more and\n\n385\n00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,090\nmore types of devices and devices that\nare not under directly under my control.\n\n386\n00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,880\nThat becomes very difficult because\nthey do become the weakest link.\n\n387\n00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,480\nAnd anything that's\nconnecting to my network,\n\n388\n00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,810\nbecomes a vector that somebody could\ntake advantage of and attack my network.\n\n389\n00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,210\nSo that's a very good point.\n\n390\n00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,600\n>> Absolutely.\n\n391\n00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,960\n>> All right so passive meaning I'm really\nnot kinda sitting back and I'm watching.\n\n392\n00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,630\nI'm letting the other end user or whoever\nit is, trying to just capture their\n\n393\n00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,670\ninformation, to either hopefully\nit's either plain text and\n\n394\n00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,580\nI can read that information out of there,\nor maybe it's encrypted, or\n\n395\n00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,420\nit's a hash value, I'm not done.\n\n396\n00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,310\nI could either try to break that password,\nor\n\n397\n00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:20,400\nI could do a replay attack where I just\nuse that authentication packer to get your\n\n398\n00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,570\ninformation at a later time to\ntry to impersonate that person.\n\n399\n00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,980\nSo passive cool, I like that, and\nit doesn't sound like we could,\n\n400\n00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,650\nthe name passive kind of applies,\nmostly, Right?\n\n401\n00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what if I want to step it\n\n402\n00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,390\nup a notch?\n\n403\n00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,010\nWhat if passive is not\nthe route I want to go?\n\n404\n00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,510\nAnd I guess there are times when\npassive is maybe not gonna work,\n\n405\n00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,150\nor not the preferred method.\n\n406\n00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,810\n>> Yeah, it could actually take\nsome time if you do it in passive.\n\n407\n00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,790\nI mean think about it, you're sitting back\nand waiting for someone to log in, or\n\n408\n00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,930\nthat hash to come across the bar.\n\n409\n00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,135\nThat could be playing a waiting game,\n\n410\n00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:58,740\nand that may not be sufficient for\nwhat you're doing.\n\n411\n00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,630\nIt may take too long.\n\n412\n00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,080\nSo, you gotta find an alternative way of\ndoing things, and if that's the case,\n\n413\n00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,370\nthen active is something that, unless\nyou get more engaged with the system.\n\n414\n00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,350\nSo that's what we're really looking at.\n\n415\n00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:14,940\nAnd I would stress when\nyou're going through the C-H,\n\n416\n00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,180\nby the way, remember passive and active.\n\n417\n00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,560\nWe've heard that term\nseveral times in here.\n\n418\n00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,240\nI could have all intents and purposes\njust focused on the online part of it and\n\n419\n00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,060\nleft out the passive versus active,\njust covered all these attacks at once.\n\n420\n00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,992\nAnd you should be able to at this point\nsay okay well you know that's obviously\n\n421\n00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,001\npassive, that's obviously active.\n\n422\n00:21:36,001 --> 00:21:39,832\nRemember passive your sitting back and\nnot interacting active you are.\n\n423\n00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:41,644\n>> Okay, good.\n\n424\n00:21:41,644 --> 00:21:46,290\nAll right, tool wise for passive we talked\nabout cuz you're just sitting back and\n\n425\n00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,378\nwatching primarily your sniffers,\n\n426\n00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:51,390\nI guess are what we're gonna\nbe using at this point.\n\n427\n00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,940\n>> Sniffers are very big\nplayer in that category.\n\n428\n00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,950\nThings like Wireshark is one of\nthe the really popular ones.\n\n429\n00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:05,970\nBut as we'll see, and we'll kind of bring\nthe stuff forward from sniffers just for\n\n430\n00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:09,590\na bit to kinda give you\nan informal introduction,\n\n431\n00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:13,790\nthere are some tools that are very\nspecific in what they target.\n\n432\n00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,510\nOne of them is,\nWireshark's general purpose,\n\n433\n00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,450\nsniffer that can do every thing and\nit tends to do it pretty well.\n\n434\n00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,930\nBut there are some ones that\ngo after specific things.\n\n435\n00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,770\nOn the Linux side we\nhave one called DSniff.\n\n436\n00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,800\nThere's a sweet of tools called DSniff,\nit's been around for a while.\n\n437\n00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,220\nDSniff has a side of it, it's got\none that's specifically designed to\n\n438\n00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,560\nsniff traffic and focus on SMTP traffic.\n\n439\n00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,340\nSo all you have to do is turn that on and\nwhen someone nearby logs into an account\n\n440\n00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,900\nusing SNTP, if that system can read it,\nit'll actually display a server name,\n\n441\n00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,310\nthe user name, and the password,\nright on your screen.\n\n442\n00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,980\nNothing else shows up, just that.\n\n443\n00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,460\nAnd so you can pipe that to a file, and\njust let it run, and sit back and wait.\n\n444\n00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,300\n>> Nice.\n\n445\n00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,040\n>> Yeah.\nSo very simple but\n\n446\n00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,710\nvery specialized in what it does.\n\n447\n00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,870\n>> Good deal.\nin fact, that's a great segment there.\n\n448\n00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,220\nCuz I know we had a question in\nthe chat room talking about,\n\n449\n00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,550\nwhen I capture packets there's so\nmuch stuff.\n\n450\n00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,460\nHow do I sort it out?\n\n451\n00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,300\nAnd, as Sean side, things like Wireshark,\nNetwork Monitor from Microsoft, and\n\n452\n00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,790\nthere's several others.\n\n453\n00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,610\nThey're capturing everything.\n\n454\n00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,300\nAnd they've got, most of them have great\nfiltering capabilities built in to them.\n\n455\n00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,580\nSo I can filter down to\na particular protocol, or\n\n456\n00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,100\nparticular source or destination IP.\n\n457\n00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,870\nIf we've done our scanning and our\nnumeration we'd probably know where that\n\n458\n00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,390\ndomain controllers and the IP\naddresses of the domain controllers,\n\n459\n00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:39,660\nwhich is where the authentication occurs\nin a Windows environment for example, so\n\n460\n00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,480\nmaybe I just look at pack as\nthey're destined for that.\n\n461\n00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,492\nOr, as you say, we've got specialized\nsniffers that only look, instead of having\n\n462\n00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:50,125\nto filter down, they're doing\nthe filtering during the capture process.\n\n463\n00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:53,640\nSo, they're only capturing Kerberos\ntraffic, or LDAP traffic, or\n\n464\n00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,960\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n465\n00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,151\nSo, couple of options there and\nthanks Michaela for\n\n466\n00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:00,625\npointing out our episode on Wireshark.\n\n467\n00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:05,571\nIf you guys wanna use that tool and you\nwanna get some insight as to the best way\n\n468\n00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:10,380\nto use it or be more efficient with it\nmake sure you check out that episode.\n\n469\n00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,300\n>> Watch it later, not while I'm talking.\n\n470\n00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,590\n>> [LAUGH] That's right,\nthat is for a later viewing.\n\n471\n00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,380\nAll right, well I tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen, that is,\n\n472\n00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,020\nlooking at the clock, it's about time for\nus to take our break.\n\n473\n00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,610\nSo why don't we stop here.\n\n474\n00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,820\nWhen we come back, we'll continue on with\nsome other methods of password cracking.\n\n475\n00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,465\nWe'll start getting into active online,\nand then some of our other forums.\n\n476\n00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:33,264\nStay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n477\n00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:39,883\n[MUSIC]\n\n478\n00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:41,984\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentleman.\n\n479\n00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,916\nContinuing on with our\ngaining access episode,\n\n480\n00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:49,000\ngetting ready to talk about some\nother forms of password tracking.\n\n481\n00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,050\nMoving on into our active online,\nwhat are we active online.\n\n482\n00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:55,860\nWe learned in our previous,\nif you've been watching.\n\n483\n00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,990\nWe talked about passive online,\n\n484\n00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,330\nwhere I'm really not interacting directly\nwith the authentication process.\n\n485\n00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,670\nI'm just sitting back, waiting for\nsomebody else to authenticate and\n\n486\n00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,735\nthen trying to capture that authentication\ninformation with a sniffer of some kind.\n\n487\n00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:15,575\nSo active to me, Shawn, is indicating\nthat I might now be doing a little more.\n\n488\n00:25:15,575 --> 00:25:17,735\n>> Oh, yes, we are up in the game here.\n\n489\n00:25:17,735 --> 00:25:19,995\nWe are definitely doing more.\n\n490\n00:25:19,995 --> 00:25:24,700\nWhat we're doing here is,\nwe are now doing more engagement\n\n491\n00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,930\nto obtain those precious\ncredentials that we wanna get.\n\n492\n00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,300\nMultiple ways here to do this as\nwell that you have available to you.\n\n493\n00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,720\nThe ones that we're concerned\nwith are first of all,\n\n494\n00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,220\nyou can get something on the system.\n\n495\n00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,620\nIf that's possible.\n\n496\n00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,090\nFor it to do, you can see about\ngetting something on the system and\n\n497\n00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,790\nthere's actually a multitude of ways\nto get something on the system.\n\n498\n00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,720\nWe talk about, and we're gonna be\ntalking more about keyloggers here.\n\n499\n00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,135\nWe'll be talking about keyloggers later.\n\n500\n00:25:57,135 --> 00:26:01,345\nWe'll also be talking about another really\npopular way to get stuff on a system is\n\n501\n00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:03,415\nthrough a trojan.\n\n502\n00:26:03,415 --> 00:26:08,785\nAnd so, that's a discussion that we'll\nhave in full with other types of malware\n\n503\n00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:13,330\nin a later module, but that's something\nelse you could consider doing.\n\n504\n00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,880\nAnd yes, we can create malware for\nour testing and\n\n505\n00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,560\nit's actually quite easy\nto get that on the system.\n\n506\n00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,140\nYou might be amazed, or\nmay not be amazed, it's as simple as,\n\n507\n00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,370\ngrab a flash drive and\njust drop these some place.\n\n508\n00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:32,160\nThis is just a regular flash drive here,\n\n509\n00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,230\nI could just drop this some place\nin a parking lot or something.\n\n510\n00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,850\nAnd you know someone's gonna plug this in,\nthat's plain and simple human nature.\n\n511\n00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,520\nThey're curious, what's on that thing?\n\n512\n00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,980\nI'm gonna go and take a look and\nplug this thing in.\n\n513\n00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:51,010\nAnd they plug it in, and a lot of systems\nhave auto run enabled, even now, so\n\n514\n00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,950\nthey plug that in,\nit runs something and boom you're done.\n\n515\n00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,750\nOkay, but here's the thing,\nit's not uncommon for\n\n516\n00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,610\na corporate environment to turn that off\nthe group policy for something like that.\n\n517\n00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,400\nOr they would just block,\n\n518\n00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,210\nit's even getting more common to block\non that storage devices like this, okay?\n\n519\n00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,680\nSo that's where you kinda\ngotta up your game on it,\n\n520\n00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,630\nand some of you probably know\nalready where I'm going with this.\n\n521\n00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,670\nSo, I got two devices here that\nwe can look at on our overhead.\n\n522\n00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,990\nWe've got a flash drive, we got something\nthat looks like another flash drive.\n\n523\n00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,130\nDon't spoil the surprise if\nyou know where I'm going.\n\n524\n00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:28,845\n>> No spoilers.\n\n525\n00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:31,174\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, this is a spoiler-free thing,\n\n526\n00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:31,854\nall right?\n\n527\n00:27:31,854 --> 00:27:38,038\nYeah, so they look like two thumb drives\nto me, I don't see the difference.\n\n528\n00:27:38,038 --> 00:27:43,040\n>> Yeah, these both look like flash\ndrives, the both look kind of the same.\n\n529\n00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,980\nNo deal, nothing fishy going on there, so\n\n530\n00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,740\nthe thing is that these aren't\nreally both flash drives.\n\n531\n00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,530\nThis is a regular flash drive.\n\n532\n00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,360\nThis is a USB mass storage device.\n\n533\n00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,920\nIt will show up,\nas such can be blocked by group policy.\n\n534\n00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,960\nThis on the other hand,\nis something called the USB rubber ducky.\n\n535\n00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,450\nIf I just disassemble this here for\na bit, I pop this off so\n\n536\n00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,890\nI've got the flash drive.\n\n537\n00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,490\nSo this device sitting right here,\nso I pop that collar off.\n\n538\n00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,920\nAnd then, what I'm gonna do is\nI'm gonna open this up for you.\n\n539\n00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:22,080\nAnd maybe we can zoom in or maybe you\ncan see this well enough on your own.\n\n540\n00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,419\nWhat I'm gonna do here, so I'm gonna\nopen up this case but gently, here.\n\n541\n00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:32,169\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We really need to rehearse this\n\n542\n00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:32,762\nstuff more.\n\n543\n00:28:32,762 --> 00:28:33,296\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n544\n00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:36,660\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So, but in any case,\n\n545\n00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,490\nwhat I'm gonna do is open this up.\n\n546\n00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:44,620\nAnd what you have inside of it\nis this little circuit board.\n\n547\n00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:52,640\nWhat this is, is it's got micro-SD\ncard in it that you can just pop in.\n\n548\n00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,290\nAnd this thing actually has its\nown scripting engine built in.\n\n549\n00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,770\nIt has a processor, everything,\nbuilt into the thing.\n\n550\n00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,660\nSo you can write a quick script and\nput something on that.\n\n551\n00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,340\nAnd then,\nwhat happens is when you plug this in,\n\n552\n00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,286\nonce you plug this into an actual victim\ncomputer or someone plugs it in for you.\n\n553\n00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:12,630\nWhat's gonna happen is,\nis it won't get blocked.\n\n554\n00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:16,570\nIt will run that script and\nit won't get blocked and\n\n555\n00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,340\nthat reason for that is,\nwhy would this get blocked?\n\n556\n00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,200\nThis USB mass storage device get blocked,\nand this not?\n\n557\n00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,320\nThis does show up as\njust like I just said.\n\n558\n00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,740\nThis is a USB mass storage device.\n\n559\n00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,370\nThis on the other hand,\nwill show up as a human interface device,\n\n560\n00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,200\nin this case a keyboard, okay?\n\n561\n00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,760\nSo unless you're gonna setup a group\npolicy to block keyboards for\n\n562\n00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,920\nsome crazy reason you're like to hell with\nit, no one is using keyboards in here.\n\n563\n00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,290\n>> Mike has a problem with\nthe rest of my systems.\n\n564\n00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,840\n>> Yeah,\nit's gonna ruin the rest of the work day\n\n565\n00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,762\n>> Yeah, its gonna lower my productivity\n\n566\n00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:50,350\na bit here.\n\n567\n00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,330\n>> Yeah, gonna get a big goose egg there.\n\n568\n00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,330\nSo this will, in just about every case,\nbypass security.\n\n569\n00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,070\nThere are some cases where it may not but\ntypically what's gonna happen,\n\n570\n00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:07,890\nthis will plug in and it will work.\n\n571\n00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:14,360\nIt's a pretty frightening and\nscary device when you think about it,\n\n572\n00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,450\nthat I can get this in, not get this in,\nbut this looks like this.\n\n573\n00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,570\nThat's social engineering there,\nsomeone will plug this in.\n\n574\n00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,070\nAll I got to do is just drop it in.\n\n575\n00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,020\nDrop it in a parking lot or\nsomething someplace and you're done.\n\n576\n00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,309\nThese things are, this like I said\nthis is called the USB rubber ducky.\n\n577\n00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:35,074\nComes with everything you see here.\n\n578\n00:30:35,074 --> 00:30:36,806\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n579\n00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:39,532\n>> So you get all this except the micro\n\n580\n00:30:39,532 --> 00:30:43,660\nUSB card, you gotta provide yourself.\n\n581\n00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,980\nYou can get this over, I know that\nsome of you already mentioned this,\n\n582\n00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,930\nthis is a Hak5.\n\n583\n00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:52,570\nThis comes from hak5.org.\n\n584\n00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,865\nYou can buy these, these are about 40\nbucks, so it's not a big investment.\n\n585\n00:30:56,865 --> 00:31:00,349\nSo you could get this thing and\nstart running tests with it.\n\n586\n00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:01,539\nYou might be amazed,\n\n587\n00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:05,248\nyou might be frightened when you\nsee just how successful it can be.\n\n588\n00:31:05,248 --> 00:31:09,346\n>> Yeah, absolutely and I remember\nreading about a really interesting story.\n\n589\n00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:12,570\nThey were doing a security test\non a financial institution and\n\n590\n00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,940\nthey did that very thing.\n\n591\n00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,130\nThey took like 20 USB drives and\nscattered them around in different places,\n\n592\n00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,830\nparking lot, bathrooms,\nlobbies, places like that.\n\n593\n00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:26,590\nAnd I wanna say, I don't remember\nthe exact numbers, but it was over 75% of\n\n594\n00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:32,270\nthose USB devices got plugged into\nthe financial institution's network.\n\n595\n00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,620\nSo here I am working at this\nfinancial institution, and\n\n596\n00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,230\nI find some random drive in\nthe bathroom or the parking lot.\n\n597\n00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,880\nand I'm gonna plug it\ninto my work computer.\n\n598\n00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,750\nAnd like John said that's\njust human nature.\n\n599\n00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,690\nLike oh, what did I find?\n\n600\n00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,090\nMaybe I found some good movies or\n\n601\n00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:48,210\nsomebody's got their music collection\non here or personal information.\n\n602\n00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,250\nPeople are curious,\nthey wanna know what's going on.\n\n603\n00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,667\nSo easy way to slip on.\n\n604\n00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:58,375\n>> I think it's human nature,\nit's that voyeuristic [LAUGH] type nature.\n\n605\n00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,458\nWhat are other people doing?\n\n606\n00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:08,375\nWhat might I find that someone's\ndoing with their lives or whatever.\n\n607\n00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,562\nSo you have one of these devices,\n\n608\n00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:14,215\nyou could very quite easily\njust prey upon that.\n\n609\n00:32:14,215 --> 00:32:18,805\nAnd you mentioned, yeah I've heard\nof several tests like that where\n\n610\n00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:22,145\npeople will take,\nthis flash drive that I've got here,\n\n611\n00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:27,390\nif you take a look at it,\nit's one I got from Cybex itself.\n\n612\n00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,310\nThis is either, I flipped it over so\nthey look the same, but\n\n613\n00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:37,180\nthe thing is, you could put a sticker of\nsomething company or something on there.\n\n614\n00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,650\nWe've all got that swag that we get for\ntrade shows and stuff like that.\n\n615\n00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:46,240\nJust stick that same swag on this little\nthing right here and stick it on there.\n\n616\n00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,970\nIt looks like a promotional device.\n\n617\n00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:48,510\n>> Absolutely.\n\n618\n00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,792\n>> Heck, pop this off and put it on that.\n\n619\n00:32:50,792 --> 00:32:51,375\n>> Right.\n\n620\n00:32:51,375 --> 00:32:54,416\n>> And so\nit looks like a promotional flash drive.\n\n621\n00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:59,304\n>> Or I bet you I could get those\nnumbers up to about 99% if I just\n\n622\n00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,627\nwrote XXX-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n623\n00:33:00,627 --> 00:33:01,793\n>> On there.\n\n624\n00:33:01,793 --> 00:33:03,390\n>> Now you're thinking.\n\n625\n00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,060\n>> Or something like that or you put,\npayroll, on the front of it, or\n\n626\n00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,770\nsomething like that.\n\n627\n00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:08,280\nA little piece of tape and put, payroll.\n\n628\n00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,610\nSomebody thinks, oh my gosh, somebody\nfrom payroll dropped the thumb drive,\n\n629\n00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,150\nwonder what I can get.\n\n630\n00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,090\nThey're going to go turn it in maybe,\nhopefully,\n\n631\n00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,230\nbut they might want to peek at it first\nbefore then do, and then it's too late.\n\n632\n00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,820\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of approaches.\n\n633\n00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,980\nI even look at something like this\nwith that little piece on here.\n\n634\n00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,694\nI could see myself getting and\nold key or something and\n\n635\n00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:30,235\nputting a key chain on that and\ndrop it someplace.\n\n636\n00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:31,920\nNow it really bumps the curiosity.\n\n637\n00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where does that key belong to?\n\n638\n00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,260\nWho owns this?\n\n639\n00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,628\nSomeone's gonna plug that in,\n\n640\n00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:38,280\ncuz they're gonna think they're gonna\nplay detective and get it back.\n\n641\n00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,091\nEither they're gonna think they're\ngonna be a good Samaritan, or\n\n642\n00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:43,570\nthey're gonna be up to mischief,\nand the joke's on them.\n\n643\n00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,960\nBut people will do this,\nI mean, I can guarantee that.\n\n644\n00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,380\nWe've got a mall down the street here.\n\n645\n00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,960\nI've got a box of flash drives back here.\n\n646\n00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,190\nI could go through and take this box of\nflash drives and put some nastiness on it,\n\n647\n00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,410\nand at lunch go throw a few of these\nin different places of the mall and\n\n648\n00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,030\ncome back here.\n\n649\n00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:10,206\nAnd probably it's only gonna be a brief\nperiod of time before I start getting\n\n650\n00:34:10,206 --> 00:34:11,980\nchirps of who's got infected.\n\n651\n00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,120\n>> Right.\nCuz someone's going to\n\n652\n00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,390\nplug these things in.\n\n653\n00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,490\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n654\n00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,694\n>> So it's,\nyou're preying upon that part of it.\n\n655\n00:34:18,694 --> 00:34:20,950\n>> [LAUGH] Craziness.\n\n656\n00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,030\nIt's just too easy to take advantage\nof human nature in the end.\n\n657\n00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:31,530\nSo when we talk about active online,\nwe've got our USB rubber ducky, and I\n\n658\n00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,750\nknow we're gonna get into some key loggers\nand things like that in a little bit.\n\n659\n00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,500\nAny other methods I might use\nif we're doing active online?\n\n660\n00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,180\nYeah, there's a couple,\nother ones that bear mentioning in here.\n\n661\n00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:48,620\nWe have guessing passwords, so\nthat's kind of explains it all.\n\n662\n00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,380\nIt's really kind of low tech.\n\n663\n00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,260\nNow, you can put some\nintelligence into it.\n\n664\n00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,000\nYou can say,\n\n665\n00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,950\ninstead of randomly guessing passwords,\nyou could put a little bit more into it.\n\n666\n00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,118\nHeck, you could even social engineer\nthe target that you want to see if you can\n\n667\n00:35:04,118 --> 00:35:04,870\nnarrow it down.\n\n668\n00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:10,249\nIn fact, amazingly enough,\nI saw something on a TV show recently that\n\n669\n00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:15,916\nwas actually reasonably realistic on\nhow that process would take place.\n\n670\n00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:19,840\nIt was on that, and\nthis would work somewhat similar to this.\n\n671\n00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,005\nIt was on that show,\nHawaii Five-0, the new one.\n\n672\n00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:23,958\n>> The newer version?\nOkay.\n\n673\n00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:29,491\n>> Yeah, one of the women on\nthat show dressed somewhat\n\n674\n00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:34,018\nprovocatively, and went to a pool hall and\n\n675\n00:35:34,018 --> 00:35:40,054\nfound the target that she\nwanted to go after, and engaged\n\n676\n00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:45,260\nhim in a game of pool and flirted with him\n>> And\n\n677\n00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,860\nstarted talking about things finding out.\n\n678\n00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,200\nAnd what she was doing,\nshe was finding out what he did,\n\n679\n00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,980\nwhat type of things he liked,\nand pets he had.\n\n680\n00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,240\nShe says, oh I gotta get home to\nfeed the dog, do you have any pets?\n\n681\n00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,260\nStuff like that.\n\n682\n00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,350\nAnd when she got enough information\nabout him she started using those\n\n683\n00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,580\nthings to see if she\ncould guess his password.\n\n684\n00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:10,130\nAnd so that would be\na reasonable type way to do it.\n\n685\n00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,935\nSo, I mean, I try to dress provocatively,\nit never works for me.\n\n686\n00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:13,505\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n687\n00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:15,188\nin any case-\n>> I don't know,\n\n688\n00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,126\nJason's been giving you the eye\nover there so maybe after the show.\n\n689\n00:36:17,126 --> 00:36:19,370\n>> Yeah, give me a little eye there.\n\n690\n00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,080\n>> [LAUGH] But yeah,\nit's a very good point.\n\n691\n00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,902\nMost people, when they generate, our end\nusers are creating their own passwords,\n\n692\n00:36:25,902 --> 00:36:30,688\nthey typically, there's a lot of them\nthat still do birthdays, anniversaries,\n\n693\n00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:34,780\ndogs' names, kids' names, spouse names,\nfavorite character from a TV show.\n\n694\n00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,550\nSo you walk into somebody's cubicle or\nyou're doing, let's say you figure out\n\n695\n00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:42,166\nsome way to get into the building for\nsome reason or meet them outside of work.\n\n696\n00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:45,607\nAnd If I walk by their cubicle and\nI see Tim Tebow signed helmets,\n\n697\n00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:48,986\nTim Tebow footballs,\nTim Tebow posters and things like that,\n\n698\n00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:52,833\nthere's a good chance that Tim Tebow's\nin their password somewhere.\n\n699\n00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:53,458\n>> Who?\n\n700\n00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:55,833\n>> Right, yeah, [LAUGH].\n\n701\n00:36:55,833 --> 00:36:58,625\nThat's a good, you guys in Gainesville,\nFlorida would know that reference but-\n\n702\n00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,333\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n703\n00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,614\n>> Yeah, looking at the,\n\n704\n00:37:00,614 --> 00:37:04,462\nlearning something about the person\ncould definitely narrow your pool\n\n705\n00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:08,820\nof guesses that you need to do when\nyou're doing that password guessing.\n\n706\n00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,340\nSo password guessing, then,\nis a form of active online where we're\n\n707\n00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,480\nreally just typing in the username and\npassword and hoping it's the right one.\n\n708\n00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,160\nIf it doesn't work, we try again,\nwe try again, we try again.\n\n709\n00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,676\nAs far as defending against that, a lot\nof systems are starting to do things like\n\n710\n00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:30,581\nlimiting the number of failed attempts\nbefore the account becomes locked and\n\n711\n00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,541\nthen it can no longer be\nused to authenticate.\n\n712\n00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:34,880\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n713\n00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,615\nThat would actually stop\nbrute force attacks as well.\n\n714\n00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:41,250\nCuz password guessing,\nthe reason why that we don't say,\n\n715\n00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,690\nwe say password guessing and\nnot brute force,\n\n716\n00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:47,070\nis brute force is just, hey, throw\neverything at it until something sticks.\n\n717\n00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,780\nPassword guessing is kinda like\nwhat I was talking about that TV\n\n718\n00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,760\nseries is that you're not\njust randomly guessing.\n\n719\n00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,640\nYou're gaining some\ninformation about the target or\n\n720\n00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,810\nusing some rules to narrow\nthe playing field down, and\n\n721\n00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:05,020\nyou mentioned about people being\ninto sports and using those ones.\n\n722\n00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,570\nIt's kind of funny, they did\na study on that some years ago, and\n\n723\n00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,950\nthey found out there's even\na gender bias in passwords.\n\n724\n00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:12,320\n>> Really?\n>> There really is, and\n\n725\n00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,920\nit's kind of amazing.\n\n726\n00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,940\nThey found out that men and\n\n727\n00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,540\nwomen tend, will skew towards\ncertain types of passwords.\n\n728\n00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,270\nThey said around 50% of the time, they\nsaid women tend to choose names of loved\n\n729\n00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:27,900\nones or family members, something\nlike that, pets, stuff like that.\n\n730\n00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,220\nGuys tend to choose, and\nI don't know to feel proud or\n\n731\n00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,147\nashamed of this-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n732\n00:38:32,147 --> 00:38:32,660\n>> It says guys choose\n\n733\n00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,444\nuse stuff that are vulgar or profane.\n\n734\n00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:35,583\n>> [LAUGH] No way!\n\n735\n00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,368\n>> I had to change all\nmy passwords after that.\n\n736\n00:38:37,368 --> 00:38:39,444\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n737\n00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:41,480\nI would throw sports teams into that, too.\n\n738\n00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,360\nIf a guy happens to live someplace, or\n\n739\n00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:52,210\nthere's a local sports team period,\nregardless of gender, that's a big deal.\n\n740\n00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:58,390\nPeople may very well choose that,\nso just think about it.\n\n741\n00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:04,130\nYou live near a football team, they might\nput that in or some variation of that.\n\n742\n00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,600\nYou live in Pittsburgh you might put\nlosers in for your favorite hockey team.\n\n743\n00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,045\n>> [LAUGH] How did I know that was coming?\n\n744\n00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:13,541\n[LAUGH] But yeah,\nyou're gaining information.\n\n745\n00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:17,554\nYou might see bumper stickers on the backs\noff their cars, things like that,\n\n746\n00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:21,753\nthat could give you a little edge as to\nwhat you're trying to guess their password\n\n747\n00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:22,450\nis for sure.\n\n748\n00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:24,901\n>> Absolutely.\n>> All right, do we need to talk about,\n\n749\n00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:29,250\nwhere would dictionary attacks,\nkind of along those same lines.\n\n750\n00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,630\nWe're gonna put that in active, or?\n\n751\n00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,230\n>> I would.\nI would put a dictionary attack where\n\n752\n00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,750\nyou're trying words out of a pre-defined\ndictionary, you're trying that,\n\n753\n00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,840\nI would put that as\nan active online attack.\n\n754\n00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,390\nIt's a good one to bring\nup because it is used.\n\n755\n00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,242\nI would put it in there because\nyou've got a list of passwords and\n\n756\n00:39:46,242 --> 00:39:49,521\nyou're trying them against your target so,\nit does,\n\n757\n00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:53,750\nvery closely, when you think about it,\nfits the definition of that.\n\n758\n00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:58,499\nAnd that's a cool one to bring up,\nthe way you asked that, because when,\n\n759\n00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:01,716\nfor all of you out there,\nwhen Mike brings it up and\n\n760\n00:40:01,716 --> 00:40:06,333\nsays it was a dictionary attack,\nI did a quick explanation of it there.\n\n761\n00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:12,490\nThere could be other attacks that pop up\nlater on, that I just can't get to here.\n\n762\n00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,862\nReason it out.\n\n763\n00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:17,440\nI mean,\nif you think about dictionary attack,\n\n764\n00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,120\nif just told you what a dictionary attack\nis and just left it at that and said, hey,\n\n765\n00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,460\nput it in the correct category,\nthink about what it's doing.\n\n766\n00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,700\nYou have a list of passwords and\nyou're firing them off at a target.\n\n767\n00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,760\nWell, it's definitely not passive.\n\n768\n00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,410\n>> Right.\n\n769\n00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,080\n>> So, and\n\n770\n00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:38,730\nit is online cuz you're not going off\nin a corner someplace and doing it.\n\n771\n00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,850\nSo, it has to be an active attack.\n\n772\n00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,884\nSo think about that.\n\n773\n00:40:42,884 --> 00:40:47,260\n>> Right, so by thinking about the process\nthat I'm going through using this attack,\n\n774\n00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,580\nI should be able to deduce where that\nwould fall in to our different categories.\n\n775\n00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n776\n00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,840\nAll right, other active onlines\nthat we should talk about?\n\n777\n00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,205\n>> There's one other one that's\nworth fitting in here and that's,\n\n778\n00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:03,720\ncuz it does come up, is it's a social\nengineering one which is phishing.\n\n779\n00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,500\nAnd it is reasonably successful even now.\n\n780\n00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,529\nPhishing is just sending a crafted link or\nsomething in an email to targets.\n\n781\n00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:17,113\nAnd usually it's a carpet bombing\napproach if you're talking phishing.\n\n782\n00:41:17,113 --> 00:41:20,348\nSo you send it out and\nhope that you gain traction or\n\n783\n00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:25,880\nsomeone clicks on that link and types\nsomething in and you get their password.\n\n784\n00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,840\nThere are some shades of phishing\nthat you'll hear come up.\n\n785\n00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:35,390\nPhishing, like I emphasize there,\nit's a carpet bomb type approach.\n\n786\n00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:41,230\nYou cast a very wide net and hope some one\nactually clicks on a link or whatever.\n\n787\n00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:45,380\nBut there's also another one called\nspear phishing, which is probably more\n\n788\n00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,179\nlikely the form that you're gonna take, or\none of the forms that you're gonna take.\n\n789\n00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:52,900\nSpear phishing means that instead\nof carpet bombing everybody and\n\n790\n00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,420\ncasting that really wide net,\n\n791\n00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,860\nwhat you're doing is you are now\ntargeting it towards a specific company.\n\n792\n00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,350\nPhishing is very general,\n\n793\n00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,310\nspear phishing means you're going\nafter a specific company or target.\n\n794\n00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,090\nSaying, not everybody, just people\nwithin the boundaries of that company.\n\n795\n00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:13,850\nAnd then there's another variation,\na sub-class within that, called whaling.\n\n796\n00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:17,815\nWhaling means you're going after only\nselect people within that organization,\n\n797\n00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:20,172\nthe people that you know\nhave that information or\n\n798\n00:42:20,172 --> 00:42:22,737\nare most likely have\nthe information that you want.\n\n799\n00:42:22,737 --> 00:42:27,401\nThat term,\nif it helps you kind of put it in context,\n\n800\n00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:31,542\nwhaling comes from like\nthe casinos in Vegas.\n\n801\n00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:34,328\nIt's the people that\novereat at the buffets.\n\n802\n00:42:34,328 --> 00:42:35,204\nNo, no.\n\n803\n00:42:35,204 --> 00:42:38,772\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, it's actually, what it is,\n\n804\n00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:40,378\nit's the-\n>> The big fish.\n\n805\n00:42:40,378 --> 00:42:41,033\n>> The big fish,\n\n806\n00:42:41,033 --> 00:42:42,741\nthe people at the casinos-\n>> The high rollers.\n\n807\n00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:46,310\n>> Yeah, the high rollers, people that\ngot, like lots and lots of money.\n\n808\n00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:50,491\nAnd the casinos target them, they can\nmake or break a night by having one of\n\n809\n00:42:50,491 --> 00:42:55,390\nthese very rich people that are betting\nsix figures, seven figures on a hand.\n\n810\n00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:59,940\nSo, they call those whales,\nthat's what you,\n\n811\n00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,440\nthat's a form of phishing for\npeople that have that vital information.\n\n812\n00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,770\n>> Yeah, so the terms really do help\nyou if you think about what's going on,\n\n813\n00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:11,225\nthink about the terms, they're gonna help\nyou remember what this stuff is, right?\n\n814\n00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:12,650\nPhishing is a pretty general term,\n\n815\n00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,260\nit just means I'm out fishing,\nI hope I catch something.\n\n816\n00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,820\nSpear phishing, well now I've got a spear,\nso I'm gonna be picking an individual\n\n817\n00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,270\ntarget or\nindividual targets that I'm trying to get.\n\n818\n00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,050\nWhaling just means it's a bigger fish,\nright?\n\n819\n00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:28,710\nSo now we're going after somebody that\nmaybe has a higher level of access or\n\n820\n00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:31,740\nis in the C categories in our companies,\nthings like that.\n\n821\n00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,557\nWe're going after the big fish.\n\n822\n00:43:32,557 --> 00:43:36,096\nSo if you just think about the terms,\nthey'll help you remember what they are.\n\n823\n00:43:36,096 --> 00:43:37,470\n>> Absolutely.\n\n824\n00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,900\n>> All right so, that takes care of\nactive then, or active online anyway.\n\n825\n00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,460\n>> Yes.\n>> Let's talk about some offline\n\n826\n00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,050\nattacks then.\n\n827\n00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,450\nLet's take it off of the system.\n\n828\n00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:53,550\nBecause there's only so far I can go a lot\nof times with the online attacks, right?\n\n829\n00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,190\nBecause we've got the passive online, I'm\njust sitting around waiting, hoping that\n\n830\n00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,080\nsomebody tries to authenticate,\nand I can capture the information.\n\n831\n00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,200\nActive online,\nI'll be doing some password guessing, or\n\n832\n00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,980\nmaybe I might do a dictionary attack or\nsomething like that.\n\n833\n00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,290\nBut a lot of systems,\nmost of our systems nowadays,\n\n834\n00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,900\nare gonna limit the number\nof attempts that I can do.\n\n835\n00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,035\nWhich is definitely gonna thwart\nsome of my success there.\n\n836\n00:44:15,035 --> 00:44:19,640\nI have to slow the process down,\ndo it over a longer period of time.\n\n837\n00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,690\nBut once we go offline, that kind of\nchanges the game a little bit, doesn't it?\n\n838\n00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:24,920\n>> Yes, it does.\n\n839\n00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,260\nIt actually allows you to be a lot more\nstealthy because you are not in any way,\n\n840\n00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,740\nshape or\nform interacting with that environment.\n\n841\n00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,800\nIt may sound like, well,\njust to kind of put it into context,\n\n842\n00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,350\nwhen you talk about a passive\nonline versus an offline attack.\n\n843\n00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:47,190\nWell, you're not doing anything\nto interact with the system\n\n844\n00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,070\nin a passive online.\n\n845\n00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:51,660\nYou're not doing anything to interact\nwith the system in an offline attack.\n\n846\n00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,940\nWell, what's the difference here?\n\n847\n00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,170\nPassive onlines can still be detected,\nas we're gonna learn, we talk about, for\n\n848\n00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,510\nexample, sniffing.\n\n849\n00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:03,270\nWhich sniffing plays a big part in\nany of the passive online attacks.\n\n850\n00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:04,950\nSniffing can be detected,\n\n851\n00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:08,540\nbecause you have to put your card\nin promiscuous mode to do that.\n\n852\n00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,740\nAnd if it's in promiscuous mode,\nit is sticking it's head up.\n\n853\n00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,590\nEven though it's reasonably quiet,\nyou're still sticking your head up, and\n\n854\n00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,200\nwe can pick that up.\n\n855\n00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,920\nDon't worry about promiscuous mode or\nwhat promiscuous mode is right now.\n\n856\n00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,340\nI know a lot of you probably already know,\nfine.\n\n857\n00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,660\nBut we'll get into the specifics about\nthat when we talk about sniffing.\n\n858\n00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,290\nBut I'm just trying to get across\nthat it can still be detected,\n\n859\n00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,990\nmaybe not as much as active,\nbut it still can be detected.\n\n860\n00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,815\nOffline, you aren't engaging\nthat system directly anymore.\n\n861\n00:45:39,815 --> 00:45:42,600\n>> Right.\n>> So you are off in a corner some place\n\n862\n00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,980\nand the interaction you may have\nwith the system is extremely brief.\n\n863\n00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,756\nThe three ones that, or\nactually the two that we look at here,\n\n864\n00:45:51,756 --> 00:45:55,579\nDistributed Network and\nrainbow tables tend to be the big ones.\n\n865\n00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:58,980\nI'll leave rainbow tables for\n\n866\n00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,300\na moment, and I'll talk about\nDistributed Network Attacks.\n\n867\n00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,506\nDistributed Network Attack,\nhow those work is,\n\n868\n00:46:06,506 --> 00:46:10,947\nwhat if you wanna get someone's\npassword and it's in a hash format?\n\n869\n00:46:10,947 --> 00:46:15,208\nWe've said that well,\nyou can't, it's infeasible,\n\n870\n00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:19,042\nmathematically infeasible\nto reverse that hash.\n\n871\n00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:22,899\nWell, I want to get the password\nthat generated that hash, or\n\n872\n00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:26,870\nthe plain text that generated\nthat hash and I don't have it.\n\n873\n00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:27,780\nHow do I get it?\n\n874\n00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,052\nWell, you can use Distributed Network\nAttack, which is where you use the power\n\n875\n00:46:32,052 --> 00:46:34,874\nof multiple computers to\nactually crack that hash.\n\n876\n00:46:34,874 --> 00:46:37,982\nAnd it just,\nit creates a bunch of hashes and\n\n877\n00:46:37,982 --> 00:46:40,758\nit can check to see which hash matches.\n\n878\n00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:43,511\nAnd by combining the power\nof multiple systems,\n\n879\n00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:48,200\nyou're getting a tremendous amount\nof power and can do it quickly.\n\n880\n00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:52,381\nAnd I think it's, I really want to\nemphasize that you could set up\n\n881\n00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:55,130\na Distributed Network Attack yourself.\n\n882\n00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,560\nYou could go back to your home or\n\n883\n00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:01,980\nyour office as a pen tester and\ngrab some systems.\n\n884\n00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:07,930\nI've got, around my house, I've got\na handful of notebooks and old desktops.\n\n885\n00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:12,030\nSome of these desktops I use for\nmy experiments and\n\n886\n00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:15,100\nstuff like that,\nthey're not exactly brand new.\n\n887\n00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,020\nSo the thing is that I still could\nuse them cuz I only a little bit of\n\n888\n00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,030\nhorsepower.\n\n889\n00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:22,649\nI'm not telling it to digest\na whole chunk of stuff,\n\n890\n00:47:22,649 --> 00:47:25,697\nI'm saying here's a spoonful of stuff,\ntake care of that.\n\n891\n00:47:25,697 --> 00:47:27,781\nAnd I'm doing the same\nthing with each system.\n\n892\n00:47:27,781 --> 00:47:33,025\nAnd by doing that it will work very,\nvery quickly.\n\n893\n00:47:33,025 --> 00:47:33,581\n>> Nice.\n>> Or\n\n894\n00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:35,779\nmuch more quickly than it would\nif I asked one to do it all.\n\n895\n00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:40,487\nAnd so by doing that, it may take some\ntime, which it will take some time.\n\n896\n00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:44,870\nIt's not instantaneous by any means,\nbut it's very quick.\n\n897\n00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,840\nNow, they've also upped the ante of this,\nor upped the game on this,\n\n898\n00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,570\nas they always have.\n\n899\n00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,020\nOne of the ones I mentioned in the book,\nand I'll bring up here,\n\n900\n00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,710\nis there's something called\nthe SETI@home project.\n\n901\n00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:56,230\n>> Yes.\n\n902\n00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,792\n>> A lot of people participated in this,\nyou may not have.\n\n903\n00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:03,839\nBut what the SETI@home project,\njust to kind of sum it up briefly,\n\n904\n00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,251\nSETI is the search for\nextraterrestrial intelligence.\n\n905\n00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,988\nAnd so they've got radio\ntelescopes all over the world, and\n\n906\n00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:15,544\nthey're scanning the skies, looking for\na different frequency bands.\n\n907\n00:48:15,544 --> 00:48:18,670\nTrying to see if there's\nsigns of anyone transmitting,\n\n908\n00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,500\nthat may be trying to contact us.\n\n909\n00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,410\nAny alien civilizations or\nanything like that.\n\n910\n00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:30,269\nSo, instead of just having the computers\nat the Seti project doing it.\n\n911\n00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:33,653\nWhat they did is they distributed\na screen saver that you\n\n912\n00:48:33,653 --> 00:48:35,815\ncould opt in to this project.\n\n913\n00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:36,875\nCreate an account.\n\n914\n00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:38,059\nBring the screen saver down.\n\n915\n00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:38,705\nLog in.\n\n916\n00:48:38,705 --> 00:48:42,767\nAnd what the screen saver would do is\nactually have a module behind it that\n\n917\n00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:45,509\nwould download a work unit\nwhich was very small.\n\n918\n00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:49,195\nAnd it would process it in your system and\nwhen you weren't doing anything,\n\n919\n00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:50,923\nuse idle cpu cycles on your system so\n\n920\n00:48:50,923 --> 00:48:55,200\nwhen you weren't doing anything the screen\nsaver kicked in it would do that.\n\n921\n00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:01,020\nAnd conceivably most people aren't using\nthe computer every moment of every day.\n\n922\n00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:07,030\nYou just left it on and it would\nprocess the stuff and send it back.\n\n923\n00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:09,840\nThey use the same technology.\n\n924\n00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,370\nFor distributing network attacks.\n\n925\n00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:13,610\nNow, you actually have several\nplaces you can go online.\n\n926\n00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,470\nYou don't have go generate\nthe hashes anymore.\n\n927\n00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:16,150\n>> All right.\n\n928\n00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,530\n>> You can just go and say, I've got an md\nfive hash, pull it out of your sniffer or\n\n929\n00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,120\nwhatever, go to this website,\npaste it in, hit submit,\n\n930\n00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,510\nand almost immediately come back\nwith what the plain text was.\n\n931\n00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:28,340\nSome have already done that.\n\n932\n00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,170\n>> Yeah, it's impressive.\n\n933\n00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,110\nI mean, it's pretty cool\ntechnology that was using.\n\n934\n00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:35,630\nI've seen it in a lot of other\norganizations have taken that idea,\n\n935\n00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:40,170\nlike when they were trying to work on\nthe human genome and things like that.\n\n936\n00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,810\nAnd, as you said,\nnot that difficult to set up myself.\n\n937\n00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:45,930\nOr you can even, a lot of these people\nstill have these things still running.\n\n938\n00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:50,950\nSo I might even be able to tap into\nthat and use that information so,\n\n939\n00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:54,850\njust a way to distribute to increase the\namount of horsepower that you're using,\n\n940\n00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:56,800\nbecause as you said,\na lot of idle machines out there.\n\n941\n00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:01,990\nI think about an organization that I used\nto work at where they had dozens and\n\n942\n00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,860\ndozens of machines, but\n\n943\n00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,400\nthose machines weren't in use at\nthe middle of the night, right?\n\n944\n00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,380\nBecause everybody went home, those\nmachines were just sitting there idle.\n\n945\n00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,910\nI could've easily slipped something\non to each one of those machines and\n\n946\n00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,310\nhad my own little, and we'll talk about\nterms like botnet and zombies and\n\n947\n00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,930\nthings like that later, but had my\nown set of 153 hundredths computers.\n\n948\n00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,120\nThat I could use, their horsepower.\n\n949\n00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,080\nAnd take that workload.\n\n950\n00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,000\nInstead of one machine,\nI've got 300 machines.\n\n951\n00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,600\nOr go further.\n\n952\n00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,440\nWhat was it, the darknet.\n\n953\n00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,820\nI think there used to be, used to\nbe able to go to a place and lease.\n\n954\n00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,200\nYou could say,\nI need 1000 computers a week.\n\n955\n00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:38,760\nYou can get them to give\nyou that horsepower.\n\n956\n00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,630\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n957\n00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:45,190\nThere's a whole underground economy for\ndoing that sort of thing if you're into\n\n958\n00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:48,150\nthat, which we're not going\ninto that kind of stuff here.\n\n959\n00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:55,650\nThat's way outside legality here, but you\ncould conceivably do that sort of thing.\n\n960\n00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,790\nBut there should be network\nattacks that we are talking here\n\n961\n00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:04,600\nare more unlikely going to be ones that we\nset up on our own stuff to crack those.\n\n962\n00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,340\nBut they wouldn't be too far\nremoved from doing a botnet.\n\n963\n00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,550\nYou could conceivably compromise other\npeople's systems to do a botnet.\n\n964\n00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,140\n>> Right.\n>> I don't know how legal that would be\n\n965\n00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:12,703\nbut you can do it.\n\n966\n00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:14,616\n>> [LAUGH] If you had permission.\n\n967\n00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:16,619\n>> If you had permission that\nwould be a different thing.\n\n968\n00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:21,400\nThe possibility is definitely there.\n\n969\n00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,880\nThe concept would still work.\n\n970\n00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n971\n00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:27,650\n>> It's fascinating that you\ncan do that sort of thing and\n\n972\n00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,440\ndo it that quickly that\nthey just adapted it.\n\n973\n00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, I saw here in the chatrooms.\n\n974\n00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,770\n>> James mentioned it's called that,\n\n975\n00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,530\nthis distributed stuff is\nalso called grid computing.\n\n976\n00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,770\nThey just re-branded it.\n\n977\n00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:42,040\nWhat, they re-brand\neverything every few years.\n\n978\n00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,300\nWhat cloud computing used to be\ncalled something else before.\n\n979\n00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,125\n>> The internet.\n\n980\n00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:48,840\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it used to be\n\n981\n00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,855\ncalled the internet.\n\n982\n00:51:49,855 --> 00:51:53,170\n>> [LAUGH] Oh shoot, all right.\n\n983\n00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:53,970\nI'll tell you what ladies and\n\n984\n00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:57,190\ngentlemen, looking at our clocks it's\nabout time for us to take another break.\n\n985\n00:51:57,190 --> 00:52:00,320\nWhen we come back, we're going to continue\non with our discussion of password\n\n986\n00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,530\ncracking, a little bit more about\nthe offline cracking process.\n\n987\n00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:08,470\nAnd we also want to talk about some\nnon-electronic methods we can use\n\n988\n00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:11,400\nto crack those passwords and\neventually gain access to a systems.\n\n989\n00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,399\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n990\n00:52:13,399 --> 00:52:20,247\n[MUSIC].\n\n991\n00:52:20,247 --> 00:52:22,230\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n992\n00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,660\nContinuing on with our gaining access.\n\n993\n00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,090\nAnd we've been talking about some\npassword cracking techniques.\n\n994\n00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,100\nAnd specifically,\n\n995\n00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,550\nat this stage we're looking at some\noffline password cracking techniques.\n\n996\n00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:41,010\nSo we've mentioned a couple of terms,\nlike rainbow tables, and hashes.\n\n997\n00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,870\nSo let's just continue on.\n\n998\n00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:46,570\nWhat are some of my options\nwith this offline attack?\n\n999\n00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:49,440\n>> Offline attacks,\none of the ones that is.\n\n1000\n00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,960\n>> So that we really need to discuss is\nthe whole idea of using rainbow tables.\n\n1001\n00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,110\nRainbow tables are one of\nthe big guys on the block.\n\n1002\n00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,856\n>> The Teletubbies.\n\n1003\n00:53:02,856 --> 00:53:04,633\n[LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1004\n00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:09,960\n[LAUGH] That's where they eat,\nthe rainbow tables.\n\n1005\n00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:13,060\nWhat a rainbow table is.\n\n1006\n00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:17,110\nA rainbow table it's\na fascinating development.\n\n1007\n00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,870\nIf you look back at some\nof the stuff we did.\n\n1008\n00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:26,530\nWhat we can do is we can capture\na hash is the discussion we had.\n\n1009\n00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,960\nWe can easily capture a hash after\nsniffing or there's other ways too.\n\n1010\n00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,830\nBut we can, once we get that hash.\n\n1011\n00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:37,170\nIf we actually want that password,\nwe're gonna have to,\n\n1012\n00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:40,980\nwe're again gonna have to up our game and\nfigure out how we're gonna do that.\n\n1013\n00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:50,410\nWell, saying that hashes are in-feasible\nto reverse, it's not practical to do that.\n\n1014\n00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:53,940\nSo we've gotta figure out some\nway to get this information.\n\n1015\n00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,020\nSo that's where a rainbow table comes in.\n\n1016\n00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:02,360\nA rainbow table,\nwhat we do is we basically get some\n\n1017\n00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,550\ninformation about the clients,\nwhat they like to say.\n\n1018\n00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:08,840\nWe kind of figure out what might be\nthe range of passwords they use.\n\n1019\n00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,260\nWe find out their hashing algorithm for\ntheir passwords.\n\n1020\n00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,560\nWhich is easy to get if you've got a hash,\n\n1021\n00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,560\nit tells you what hashing\nalgorithm it used.\n\n1022\n00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,210\nSo we've got that.\n\n1023\n00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:20,900\nWhat we're gonna do is maybe get\nan idea of what lengths they use.\n\n1024\n00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:23,120\nMost companies, for example,\nwill use character or\n\n1025\n00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,260\npasswords that are no less\nthan eight characters, so.\n\n1026\n00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,864\nDon't hash the values for two character\npasswords their not gonna exist.\n\n1027\n00:54:29,864 --> 00:54:31,370\n>> Right.\n>> Your wasting time.\n\n1028\n00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:35,150\n>> And we could have gained some of this\ninformation during our enumeration phase\n\n1029\n00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:37,938\nwe talk about like enumerating\npolicies and password policies.\n\n1030\n00:54:37,938 --> 00:54:38,612\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1031\n00:54:38,612 --> 00:54:42,435\n>> Being a big part of that, like Charles\nsays, don't waste your time generating\n\n1032\n00:54:42,435 --> 00:54:45,625\na table of three characters,\nfour characters, five characters.\n\n1033\n00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:48,115\nStart at eight, and\ngo up to what's reasonable.\n\n1034\n00:54:48,115 --> 00:54:48,935\nWhat are they gonna have?\n\n1035\n00:54:48,935 --> 00:54:52,420\nMaximum length and limit,\nthat just makes it a little bit easier.\n\n1036\n00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,080\nReduces your time.\n\n1037\n00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,150\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1038\n00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:59,480\nSo once you got that\n\n1039\n00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:04,910\nrange in length and know the hash, you can\nadd that, the hashing algorithm they use.\n\n1040\n00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,920\nThere's plenty of software packages.\n\n1041\n00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,363\nThere's rt gen.\n\n1042\n00:55:08,363 --> 00:55:10,260\nWin rt gen and\n\n1043\n00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:13,660\nthere's other tool like that out\nthere that do the same type of thing.\n\n1044\n00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,670\nThose are just a couple,\n\n1045\n00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:19,770\nyou can explore other ones in\nthe family of rainbow tables.\n\n1046\n00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,750\nBut what they will do they\nwill pre generate that range,\n\n1047\n00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:29,480\nall the hashes and different combinations\nof characters It's gonna some time.\n\n1048\n00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,150\nIt is gonna take, it is gonna take some\nserious time to generate these scratch.\n\n1049\n00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,640\nYou can by the way download these things.\n\n1050\n00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:37,631\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1051\n00:55:37,631 --> 00:55:38,730\n>> So, there's,\n\n1052\n00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,370\nall the stuff when they came\nup with these attacks and\n\n1053\n00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,250\nthe ones they will test on CEH\nare assuming that you generate from.\n\n1054\n00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,620\nFrom scratch but you can download it.\n\n1055\n00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:51,793\nThe game it changes pretty rapidly,\nsome have already accounted for that.\n\n1056\n00:55:51,793 --> 00:55:57,152\nBut, in any case, once you have that\nrainbow table that database of text and\n\n1057\n00:55:57,152 --> 00:56:01,924\nhashes that resulted from it,\nall you have to do at that point is take\n\n1058\n00:56:01,924 --> 00:56:06,950\nthe hash that you have, capture and\njust go to whatever program that's\n\n1059\n00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,556\nactually the interface to it, And\njust say search for this hash,\n\n1060\n00:56:11,556 --> 00:56:16,650\nit'll go through the whole database and\nfind the hash that matches it.\n\n1061\n00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:20,980\nAnd all you gotta do is go across and look\nto see what text generated that hash, and\n\n1062\n00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,560\nyou're done, you've got the password.\n\n1063\n00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:28,470\nAt that point, you can if you already have\na user name that went with that hash.\n\n1064\n00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,010\nAll you have to do go to the system bring\nin a login dialog, type in the user name,\n\n1065\n00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,870\ntype in the password,\nhit the OK and you're in.\n\n1066\n00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:39,070\nThat is the limit of your interaction on\nthe system, and if you think about it.\n\n1067\n00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,270\nThat interaction that you just did.\n\n1068\n00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,640\nThat's not out of the ordinary.\n\n1069\n00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,900\nThat's, if you do it, as long as you\ndo it at the right time of day and\n\n1070\n00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,400\nyou don't do anything funny with that.\n\n1071\n00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,570\nThat's probably not gonna be\ndetected right away if at all.\n\n1072\n00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:58,414\nI mean if someone's only there from 9 to 5\nand you do it at 2 a.m that's different.\n\n1073\n00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:05,354\nBut if you do it during the day,\nit is probably just not gonna be detected.\n\n1074\n00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:08,740\n>> Yeah, but how is it gonna tell\nif that is not a legitimate login?\n\n1075\n00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,140\nYou've got the username.\n\n1076\n00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:11,290\nYou've got the password.\n\n1077\n00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:14,060\nYou're sending it over to\nthe identity store, and\n\n1078\n00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,630\nyou're good to go as long as\nyou don't do anything silly.\n\n1079\n00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:22,540\nOr they've got specific hours\nthen probably not gonna look like\n\n1080\n00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,510\nanything other than legitimate use.\n\n1081\n00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:28,690\n>> Yeah, exactly and\nthat's the important thing is that\n\n1082\n00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:33,470\nif this attack is executed in a nice and\nelegant way.\n\n1083\n00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:37,270\nYou're gonna be able to get right in,\ngrab that hash.\n\n1084\n00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:40,650\nYou snipped really quick, grab the hash\nand compared it and went back,\n\n1085\n00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:41,630\nlogged in, done.\n\n1086\n00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:42,270\n>> Yeah.\n\n1087\n00:57:42,270 --> 00:57:46,810\nAnd at this point, but again, the system\ncan't tell that it's not that person, so\n\n1088\n00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:51,402\nyou've got whatever access that\naccount that you've cracked has.\n\n1089\n00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:56,910\nSo it either maybe that's enough, maybe\nwe go on and we try to do some things\n\n1090\n00:57:56,910 --> 00:58:00,250\nto bring up our level of access,\nwhich we'll talk about later.\n\n1091\n00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,190\nBut, yeah, you're good.\n\n1092\n00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,800\nAnd relatively easy to get,\nlike you said, get these hashes.\n\n1093\n00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,630\nYou might be sniffing\nthem off the network.\n\n1094\n00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:12,196\nYou might access the actual\nsecurity account database,\n\n1095\n00:58:12,196 --> 00:58:14,286\nthat the identity store\nthat they're using.\n\n1096\n00:58:14,286 --> 00:58:16,909\nSo several different ways\nwe could obtain those.\n\n1097\n00:58:16,909 --> 00:58:19,001\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1098\n00:58:19,001 --> 00:58:20,647\n>> All right, so other types,\n\n1099\n00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:24,260\nthat's really the big\noffline attack method, right?\n\n1100\n00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:28,260\n>> Yeah, there's other ones you could\npotentially do in there that are very\n\n1101\n00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,198\noff the radar or not as popular.\n\n1102\n00:58:30,198 --> 00:58:33,740\nAll right, and we're just not\ngonna worry about those here.\n\n1103\n00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:37,520\nBut those are the big ones\nthat you have to worry about,\n\n1104\n00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,520\nthe distributed network and\nthe rainbow table.\n\n1105\n00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,660\n>> All right, okay.\n\n1106\n00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,660\n>> So we talked about passive online,\nwe've talked about active online.\n\n1107\n00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,520\nWe've looked at offline,\n\n1108\n00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,570\nanother class of occasion of password\nattacks would be the non-electronic form.\n\n1109\n00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,568\n>> So what do we do with non,\nhow do we do it non-electronically?\n\n1110\n00:58:55,568 --> 00:58:58,250\n>> Yeah, I think non-electronic\nkinda gives it away.\n\n1111\n00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,710\nWhen you talk about non-electronic, you\nare really not using technology anymore.\n\n1112\n00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:08,700\nYou're using cunning and\ncreativity to get a password now.\n\n1113\n00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,841\nWe have things like shoulder surfing,\nfor example.\n\n1114\n00:59:12,841 --> 00:59:17,229\nShoulder surfing,\nthat's about as low-tech as you can get.\n\n1115\n00:59:17,229 --> 00:59:21,582\nAnd shoulder surfing is literally is\nif I was standing behind Mike here, and\n\n1116\n00:59:21,582 --> 00:59:23,360\nhe was typing in his password.\n\n1117\n00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,320\nI'm somewhere over here watching\nto see what his password or\n\n1118\n00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:32,320\nwatch the way he types it in,\nI've got it and that's the end of it.\n\n1119\n00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:36,698\nI should mention that there's some things\nthat are making this a lot easier.\n\n1120\n00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:39,680\nThis is practical\nknowledge here this isn't\n\n1121\n00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,340\nsomething that is tested on the CEH exam.\n\n1122\n00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,130\nBut yeah, shoulder surfing just looking\nover someone's shoulder observing what\n\n1123\n00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:47,680\nthey type or what is popping up on screen.\n\n1124\n00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,310\nWhat has been to convention for\nyears when you type something for\n\n1125\n00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:53,140\na password it puts to\nlittle blips in there.\n\n1126\n00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:58,710\nOkay, so what they've done over the years,\n\n1127\n00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,880\nbut things have started\nto changed recently.\n\n1128\n01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,670\nWhat they've is done,\nis they've broken security and\n\n1129\n01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:08,110\nI would encourage you all to\nremember this little detail.\n\n1130\n01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,530\nIs that, Microsoft does this\nas well as other products.\n\n1131\n01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:15,450\nThere's a little box there,\nit says display password while I'm typing.\n\n1132\n01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,800\nSo now, shoulder surfing's a lot easier,\nbecause if people see that,\n\n1133\n01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,055\nthey're gonna say oh, well check that in,\nthis is a little much easier.\n\n1134\n01:00:23,055 --> 01:00:25,535\nI'm just gonna look over and got it done.\n\n1135\n01:00:25,535 --> 01:00:26,343\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n1136\n01:00:26,343 --> 01:00:28,715\n>> All I gonna do is have my\ncell phone at the ready and\n\n1137\n01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:31,825\njust tap and take a picture of it,\nI've got it.\n\n1138\n01:00:31,825 --> 01:00:32,568\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1139\n01:00:32,568 --> 01:00:37,540\nThat is huge and has a great point with\nphones now in days, even if they're\n\n1140\n01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,050\nopfuscating with the asterisk or\nthe splats or the dots or what have you.\n\n1141\n01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:44,810\nYou type one character either that\ncharacter is visible, and then you go to\n\n1142\n01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,230\ntype the next character and the previous\ncharacter becomes the dot or the asterisk.\n\n1143\n01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:52,160\nWell, if I'm sitting behind you with\nmy camera, pretending I'm texting,\n\n1144\n01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,345\nI have my video camera running.\n\n1145\n01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:55,640\nAnd I'm capturing everything\nthat you're typing in there.\n\n1146\n01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:57,800\nI can basically see\nyou're password that way.\n\n1147\n01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,600\nAs you said, not really part of the exam,\nbut I think about this all the time now\n\n1148\n01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:06,570\nwith the convenience of debit cards and\nthings like that being used everywhere.\n\n1149\n01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:12,420\nHow do you make sure that guy behind you\nisn't watching what you're typing in?\n\n1150\n01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,810\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1151\n01:01:13,810 --> 01:01:18,640\nThat's really the thing.\n\n1152\n01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:23,420\nSo many places where people can\npotentially do shoulder surfing.\n\n1153\n01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:28,140\nI was thinking this just last\nweek when I was in Hawaii.\n\n1154\n01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:30,655\nThe stores that they have for tourists,\n\n1155\n01:01:30,655 --> 01:01:34,765\nthey've got these next to the cash\nregister, they got the debit card thing.\n\n1156\n01:01:34,765 --> 01:01:38,785\nAnd the several of the stores\nthat the checkout,\n\n1157\n01:01:38,785 --> 01:01:41,985\nthe register is about, where you\nput your stuff is about this high.\n\n1158\n01:01:41,985 --> 01:01:45,910\nThe cash register's here, the place where\nyou run your debit card is up here, and\n\n1159\n01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,920\nthere's nothing covering it.\n\n1160\n01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,170\nYou're supposed to go like this, everyone\nback here can see what's going on.\n\n1161\n01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:54,600\nSo, it was like, who though of that?\n\n1162\n01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,800\nSo, I insisted every place I went to,\nanytime I went to one of those stores to\n\n1163\n01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:01,350\nget anything,\nI just said run it as credit.\n\n1164\n01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:06,400\nIt took a little extra verification,\nI had to show my driver's license or\n\n1165\n01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,450\nsomething but the credit card\nthey ran behind the counter.\n\n1166\n01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:11,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n1167\n01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,260\n>> The debit card you had to\npunch your stuff in right there.\n\n1168\n01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,370\n>> Trying to put your hand up there and\nhide what you're typing.\n\n1169\n01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,660\n>> Yeah, why don't you make the display\nabout this big and make it easy for\n\n1170\n01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,510\neveryone back here.\n\n1171\n01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:24,940\nMake it like a big billboard or\nsomething, it was really a dumb set up.\n\n1172\n01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:31,145\nAnd that's the thing for me,\nthat comes down to situational awareness.\n\n1173\n01:02:31,145 --> 01:02:34,448\nYou've got to teach your users that too,\nsituational awareness.\n\n1174\n01:02:34,448 --> 01:02:35,104\n>> Yeah.\n\n1175\n01:02:35,104 --> 01:02:39,680\n>> Because I've got\na different type of training,\n\n1176\n01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,810\nyou guys have a different\ntype of training.\n\n1177\n01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:43,755\nI'm sure some of you would\npick that up too and\n\n1178\n01:02:43,755 --> 01:02:46,870\nwould be,\nI'm not typing my stuff in there.\n\n1179\n01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:51,100\nBut the average Joe that does not\nhave that just gotta do that,\n\n1180\n01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,285\nwell, you need my number.\n\n1181\n01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:54,255\nTap.\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1182\n01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:58,010\n[COUGH] Another form of offline attacks,\nwe got shoulder surfing.\n\n1183\n01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:01,120\nYou have people tend to write\ntheir passwords down and\n\n1184\n01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,140\nI think we talked about\nthat in a previous episode.\n\n1185\n01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,470\nWhere it's not so much that writing\ntheir password down is a bad thing,\n\n1186\n01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:08,234\nit's where you write it down.\n\n1187\n01:03:08,234 --> 01:03:11,610\nAnd how you secure that piece of\npaper that you wrote it down on.\n\n1188\n01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:15,980\nI remember reading one study that they\ndid, and it was a government building.\n\n1189\n01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:20,300\nAnd they found 70% of the passwords\nwithin three feet of the keyboard.\n\n1190\n01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,690\nSo, either a sticky note under\nthe keyboard, taped to the monitor,\n\n1191\n01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:26,130\nin the first desk drawer,\nthings like that.\n\n1192\n01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:29,950\nSo just another way that I might be able\nto get that password without doing any\n\n1193\n01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:34,811\ntype of completely non-electronic.\n\n1194\n01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:39,260\n>> Yeah, it's different world now.\n\n1195\n01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,895\n>> Sticky notes, the bane of security,\nI mean they really can be.\n\n1196\n01:03:43,895 --> 01:03:47,665\n>> My favorite one I ever saw was\na client I did some work for and\n\n1197\n01:03:47,665 --> 01:03:51,975\nthey actually wrote their passwords with\na sharpie on the corner of the monitor.\n\n1198\n01:03:51,975 --> 01:03:55,332\nBecause clearly that's an important\nitem you don't wanna lose.\n\n1199\n01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,922\n>> Right, right.\n\n1200\n01:03:56,922 --> 01:04:01,626\n>> I can't begin to tell you, when I\nsaw that first of all was like, really?\n\n1201\n01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:05,197\nAnd then I can't tell you how\ntempted I was to say, I gotta work,\n\n1202\n01:04:05,197 --> 01:04:08,000\nI gotta do some stuff,\nlay it all, lock up.\n\n1203\n01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,417\nAnd then move all the monitors around and\nwatch the fun and games the next day.\n\n1204\n01:04:11,417 --> 01:04:13,380\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No doubt.\n\n1205\n01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,440\n>> We can't log in.\n\n1206\n01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,080\n>> One, you're telling everybody your\npassword, cuz it's written right there.\n\n1207\n01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:21,040\nAnd two, you obviously never planned\nto change your password either,\n\n1208\n01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,780\ncuz you wrote it in sharpie\non your monitor, right?\n\n1209\n01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,460\nOr you just keep adding to\nthe end of it a little one or\n\n1210\n01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,860\nzero, incrementing that number at the end.\n\n1211\n01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:33,350\nLet's see.\nOther non-electronic things that\n\n1212\n01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:36,815\nwe've just dumpster diving, we'll\nkind of get into it when we get into.\n\n1213\n01:04:36,815 --> 01:04:42,385\n>> Well, we can mention that dumpster\ndiving is a form of non electronic attack,\n\n1214\n01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:45,155\nand it's still extremely popular.\n\n1215\n01:04:46,305 --> 01:04:50,620\nOne person's trash is another person's\ntreasure, as the saying goes.\n\n1216\n01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:55,740\nSo you gotta watch what you throw away,\nbecause those\n\n1217\n01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,760\ncould very well include little nuggets of\ninformation and it's not just passwords.\n\n1218\n01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,270\nIt could be things well outside of that,\ntoo.\n\n1219\n01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:08,990\nAnd if you don't know,\nthis is done on a regular basis.\n\n1220\n01:05:10,610 --> 01:05:13,650\nEven today,\nit gets done in broad daylight.\n\n1221\n01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,930\nPeople may not come under\nthe cover of darkness and do this.\n\n1222\n01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:17,538\nThey might show up in broad daylight.\n\n1223\n01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:24,095\nSo, and it doesn't take that long to do\na dumpster dive, especially if you do\n\n1224\n01:05:24,095 --> 01:05:28,920\ncombine in the evening some of these big\nbusinesses, and I've seen that personally.\n\n1225\n01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:35,159\nHaving worked for\nbig corporations in the past,\n\n1226\n01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:40,832\nI saw people just pull their pickup\ntruck in, and they kinda knew\n\n1227\n01:05:40,832 --> 01:05:46,000\nwhen the janitorial staff was throwing\nthose big clear plastic bags out of stuff.\n\n1228\n01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000\nThey would just wait until when they knew\npretty much those things were going to\n\n1229\n01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,010\nbe out there, pull the pickup truck in,\nand throw it in.\n\n1230\n01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:57,342\nI saw that and caught it,\ncuz it was just myself, and\n\n1231\n01:05:57,342 --> 01:05:59,780\nI called security and\n[NOISE] sheriff's department and\n\n1232\n01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:03,288\neverything came in really quick to see\nwhat was going on cuz it's suspicious.\n\n1233\n01:06:03,288 --> 01:06:08,155\nFirst of all, someone's grabbing trash\nbags, just throwing them in the back of\n\n1234\n01:06:08,155 --> 01:06:12,750\na random pick up truck, and then on top\nof it, it's like two in the morning.\n\n1235\n01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,160\nNo, it doesn't add up.\n\n1236\n01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,788\nI wanna know why they were there and\nyou better have a good explanation.\n\n1237\n01:06:19,788 --> 01:06:22,205\nSo that was the thing.\n\n1238\n01:06:22,205 --> 01:06:26,060\nIt's a very common thing, so.\n\n1239\n01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,820\n>> Yeah, maybe people like dumpster\ndiving, oh my god, that's disgusting.\n\n1240\n01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:32,740\nBut honestly, a lot of times they're not\nthat, well the dumpsters aren't that bad\n\n1241\n01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,550\nunless you got restaurants in\nthe area that are also dumping in.\n\n1242\n01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:38,420\nWe might have some lunch left over,\nsome coffee grounds, something like that,\n\n1243\n01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:41,820\nbut like you said a lot of times the\njanitors they're going out after work and\n\n1244\n01:06:41,820 --> 01:06:46,110\ndumping all the trash cans next to\nthe cubicle, so it's mostly paperwork and\n\n1245\n01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,410\nthings like that.\n\n1246\n01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:50,630\nWe all know, system admins,\nI've done it myself.\n\n1247\n01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:53,060\nI've got somebody coming in,\nI write down on a sticky note, hey,\n\n1248\n01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,272\nhere's the password for your account.\n\n1249\n01:06:55,272 --> 01:06:58,640\nYou're gonna have to change it maybe\nonce you log in for that first time.\n\n1250\n01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,950\nHopefully we set that up.\n\n1251\n01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:01,430\nBut odds are they're gonna take that,\n\n1252\n01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:03,660\nthrow it away as soon as\nthey're done with it.\n\n1253\n01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,480\nNow, somebody could very well know\nmy temp password that I use for\n\n1254\n01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,630\nall new accounts and so they say, oh,\nwell they're hiring ten new people.\n\n1255\n01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,360\nI bet you they've already got an account.\n\n1256\n01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,560\nI know they use the format of\nfirst initial last name, and\n\n1257\n01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:17,320\nthey've always used\nthe same temp password and\n\n1258\n01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,900\nnow they're in, if they get there before\nthat person changes the password.\n\n1259\n01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,130\n>> Yeah,\nyou bring up a lot of good points on that.\n\n1260\n01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,100\nA lot of good points.\n\n1261\n01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,606\n>> People don't think about disposal,\nright?\n\n1262\n01:07:27,606 --> 01:07:30,820\nOf those things they write\nimportant information down on and\n\n1263\n01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:34,940\npasswords are just one of the things that\npeople tend to write down and then when\n\n1264\n01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:38,990\nthey're done with it, do not dispose of it\nproperly because it's just a sticky note.\n\n1265\n01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:41,140\nI'm not gonna walk all\nthe way down to the shredder.\n\n1266\n01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,930\nI'm not gonna go take this\nto my secure dumpster.\n\n1267\n01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:45,538\nI'm just gonna wad it up and\nthrow it in my trash.\n\n1268\n01:07:45,538 --> 01:07:48,205\nWho's gonna get that, right?\n\n1269\n01:07:48,205 --> 01:07:49,846\nDefinitely some good or\n\n1270\n01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:54,205\nsome possible ways that I might\nbe able to get those passwords.\n\n1271\n01:07:54,205 --> 01:07:57,400\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1272\n01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:00,360\n>> So password cracking, a few\ndifferent options that we have there.\n\n1273\n01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:04,430\nWe've got our passive onlines where we're\njust kind of sitting back, watching and\n\n1274\n01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:07,460\nwaiting for somebody else to authenticate\nand capturing the information for\n\n1275\n01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:12,698\npossibly replay attacks later on, or\neven cracking of that that we've captured.\n\n1276\n01:08:12,698 --> 01:08:16,775\nActive online where we are now,\nengaging with the system,\n\n1277\n01:08:16,775 --> 01:08:19,355\nmaybe doing some password guessing.\n\n1278\n01:08:19,355 --> 01:08:23,825\nThen we've got our offline methods\nwhere we're maybe capturing\n\n1279\n01:08:23,825 --> 01:08:28,715\nthe hash values or however they're storing\nthose passwords, taking it offline so\n\n1280\n01:08:28,715 --> 01:08:33,385\nthat I can use, at my leisure,\nwork on cracking those passwords or\n\n1281\n01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:37,920\nstart doing some distributed type\nattacks to increase my horsepower.\n\n1282\n01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:40,930\nJust shorten the process that it\ntakes to crack those passwords.\n\n1283\n01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,830\nAnd then the one that a lot of people\ndon't think about is the non electronic\n\n1284\n01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:48,140\nmeans of cracking passwords,\nwhere I'm doing that shoulder surfing or\n\n1285\n01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:53,080\ndumpster diving and things like that\nto try to obtain those passwords.\n\n1286\n01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:57,346\nSo a lot of good information there that\npretty much wraps up password tracking for\n\n1287\n01:08:57,346 --> 01:08:57,920\nnow, or?\n\n1288\n01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,100\n>> Well, lets talk about\na couple more things if I can,\n\n1289\n01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:04,160\nwith the couple of moments\nwe have left here.\n\n1290\n01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,220\nYeah, one more type of doing offline\nattack is the social engineering aspect.\n\n1291\n01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,790\nYou can very well do that, which is\nwhere you just talk to somebody and\n\n1292\n01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:15,408\nit's actually amazing how easy it is\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1293\n01:09:15,408 --> 01:09:18,087\n>> to talk somebody out of their password.\n\n1294\n01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:21,330\nYou can ask, in a lot of cases,\nwhat's your password?\n\n1295\n01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:22,630\nOh it's this.\n\n1296\n01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:26,899\nThey don't even realize anything is wrong,\nthey just got worked doing that.\n\n1297\n01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:27,920\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1298\n01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,621\n>> What's your password?\n\n1299\n01:09:28,621 --> 01:09:31,480\nThis.\nOkay thanks.\n\n1300\n01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:35,240\nIt's sometimes the case of just being\nin the right place at the right time.\n\n1301\n01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,400\nYou can believe that.\n\n1302\n01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:42,020\nI actually years ago walked into\na place where I was subbing in for\n\n1303\n01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,620\na friend that was imaging some systems.\n\n1304\n01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,520\nThey knew him, didn't know me.\n\n1305\n01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,856\nI walk in that morning and\n\n1306\n01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:54,205\nthe the chief IT admin of\nthe place just literally met me.\n\n1307\n01:09:54,205 --> 01:09:56,188\nI walked in and shake his hand and\nhe says, oh hey,\n\n1308\n01:09:56,188 --> 01:09:57,663\nyou're gonna be doing the imaging.\n\n1309\n01:09:57,663 --> 01:10:01,180\nHands me a CD with\na Post-it note stuck on it.\n\n1310\n01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:03,400\nIt has his domain admin password on it.\n\n1311\n01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,410\nI think it was enterprise admin,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n1312\n01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,780\nEvery last little piece of stuff in here.\n\n1313\n01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:13,707\nHe didn't know me from any other person,\ndidn't check credentials,\n\n1314\n01:10:13,707 --> 01:10:15,232\ndidn't do anything else.\n\n1315\n01:10:15,232 --> 01:10:19,810\nAnd on top of it, gives me that having\nno idea what my level of skill was.\n\n1316\n01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:24,490\nI could have messed that place up\nroyally if I was that type of person.\n\n1317\n01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:26,180\n>> But Sean,\nyou have such a trusting face.\n\n1318\n01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:26,990\n>> Yeah, well look at this.\n\n1319\n01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:29,375\nCome on.\n>> [LAUGH] Who wouldn't trust that face?\n\n1320\n01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,175\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1321\n01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:32,346\n>> [LAUGH] I know somebody back on\n\n1322\n01:10:32,346 --> 01:10:34,732\nthe crew that wouldn't.\n\n1323\n01:10:34,732 --> 01:10:41,410\nBut yeah, that would,\nit was literally that easy to get it.\n\n1324\n01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:42,480\nI wasn't even trying.\n\n1325\n01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:43,920\nI mean I literally wasn't trying.\n\n1326\n01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:44,680\nThey gave it to me.\n\n1327\n01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,440\nI'm like, all right.\n\n1328\n01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,650\nSo it could be that easy.\n\n1329\n01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:51,110\nSometimes, in fact,\n\n1330\n01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:54,640\none of the more common ways to do it is\njust act like they're someone from IT.\n\n1331\n01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:57,710\nCall someone up say I'm from IT and\n\n1332\n01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:01,335\nthey'll just do some,\ncraft some questions.\n\n1333\n01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:02,505\nThey'll give it to you that way, too.\n\n1334\n01:11:02,505 --> 01:11:07,135\n>> Yeah, large organizations,\nnot everybody knows everybody personally.\n\n1335\n01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:09,105\nSo you do the right name dropping.\n\n1336\n01:11:09,105 --> 01:11:11,605\nWe talked about having confidence and\nthings like that,\n\n1337\n01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:16,497\nwhere if I act like I'm in authority or\nthat I belong there or have that position,\n\n1338\n01:11:16,497 --> 01:11:20,542\nyou'd be surprised what information\npeople will actually turn over to you.\n\n1339\n01:11:20,542 --> 01:11:24,650\nYou make up something like,\noh we're changing over to a new system and\n\n1340\n01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:28,420\nI wanna make sure that you can use your\nsame password on this new system, so\n\n1341\n01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:31,440\nif you give me your old password I'll make\nsure that's imported into the new one and\n\n1342\n01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,030\nyou won't have to worry about\ncoming up with new passwords.\n\n1343\n01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:35,460\nAnd people give you their own password.\n\n1344\n01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:39,350\nYou can do it via email, you can\nname drop, you can do it in person.\n\n1345\n01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:41,650\nIt really is too easy, and\n\n1346\n01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:47,810\nwe talked about there just is no patch for\nthe human aspect of our networking.\n\n1347\n01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:51,086\nSo it comes down to user education,\nteaching them that,\n\n1348\n01:11:51,086 --> 01:11:53,884\nyou guys have all seen it,\nyour banks I'm sure,\n\n1349\n01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:58,413\nhave sent you a million emails that say\nwe will never ask you for your password.\n\n1350\n01:11:58,413 --> 01:12:00,598\nIn teaching your users-\n>> There's a reason why you gotta\n\n1351\n01:12:00,598 --> 01:12:03,000\ntell them that all the time\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n1352\n01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000\nBecause people will say,\noh you need my password?\n\n1353\n01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,292\nHere you go, here it is.\n\n1354\n01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:07,583\nThat's what teaching your users that.\n\n1355\n01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:09,583\nLook, we're never going to ask you for\nyour password.\n\n1356\n01:12:09,583 --> 01:12:13,421\nIf we need your password, I can reset it\nto whatever I want as the domain admin or\n\n1357\n01:12:13,421 --> 01:12:16,387\nwhatever, and I'll tell you\nwhat your new password is, and\n\n1358\n01:12:16,387 --> 01:12:19,410\nthen you can change it to\nsomething that only you know.\n\n1359\n01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:24,222\nBut teaching our users that, they don't\nunderstand that which is why social\n\n1360\n01:12:24,222 --> 01:12:29,050\nengineering becomes a very easy way to\ngain access to somebody's password.\n\n1361\n01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:35,160\n>> And\nthen just one more thing to mention on\n\n1362\n01:12:35,160 --> 01:12:39,340\nhere I brought up on my\nscreen here I brought up.\n\n1363\n01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:45,560\nA website, it's w3dt.net.\n\n1364\n01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,980\nAnd it's got plenty of tools on it but\none of them you can see\n\n1365\n01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:54,560\nover here down on the bottom right\nis a default password lookup.\n\n1366\n01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,820\nA default password lookup I\ncan quite easily, it says,\n\n1367\n01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:03,600\nyou can see it saying put in your name\nof the hardware or software of vendor.\n\n1368\n01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,550\nAnd I can just type in,\nI'll type in Linksys to keep it easy.\n\n1369\n01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:11,660\nSo I'll type in Linksys,\nhit enter on that.\n\n1370\n01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:15,310\nIt's going to take a quick look at things.\n\n1371\n01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:18,800\nAnd you can see,\nI'm not going to worry about\n\n1372\n01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,320\ngoing through the whole list, or\nfolks with any specific password.\n\n1373\n01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,610\nIf you want to take a look at it,\n\n1374\n01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:30,405\nyou know the website down\nhere to try some stuff out.\n\n1375\n01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:33,155\nSites like this are actually\npretty accurate.\n\n1376\n01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:34,445\nThey're pretty accurate.\n\n1377\n01:13:34,445 --> 01:13:35,405\n>> Oh, yeah?\n>> Because people\n\n1378\n01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:36,965\ndo contribute stuff to this.\n\n1379\n01:13:36,965 --> 01:13:39,445\nThey actively contribute stuff to it.\n\n1380\n01:13:39,445 --> 01:13:44,670\nAnd the idea here on some of these sites\nis, well heck, we're gonna provide,\n\n1381\n01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,690\nwe're gonna put the passwords in there\njust in case you lose your documentation.\n\n1382\n01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:51,650\nI've actually seen a few that said,\noh you lost the documentation for\n\n1383\n01:13:51,650 --> 01:13:53,780\nthat device, we'll publish it.\n\n1384\n01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:56,620\nIt's probably available\nfrom the vendor anyway.\n\n1385\n01:13:56,620 --> 01:13:58,650\nBut this is about as easy as you can get.\n\n1386\n01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,440\nSome of this stuff is not\navailable from the vendor.\n\n1387\n01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,310\nYou notice in here, we have stuff,\nLinksys stuff in here from Comcast.\n\n1388\n01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:06,945\nAnd its got password and privileges.\n\n1389\n01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:09,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Check it out on that one.\n\n1390\n01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,340\nIt's says Comcast.\n\n1391\n01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,350\nComcast supply blah, blah, blah.\n\n1392\n01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,190\npassword, 1234.\n\n1393\n01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:16,760\nComcast did that.\n\n1394\n01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:23,258\nI want to smack somebody\nat Comcast right now.\n\n1395\n01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:26,540\n[LAUGH] It's bad.\n\n1396\n01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,680\nJust take a look at stuff like this.\n\n1397\n01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:32,460\nThis is not the only site for this.\n\n1398\n01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,699\n>> Right.\n>> There's plenty of sites that do this.\n\n1399\n01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:41,275\nAnd in my years of experience,\npeople I've shown this to,\n\n1400\n01:14:41,275 --> 01:14:44,370\nshows sites like this to have said yeah,\nthat's correct.\n\n1401\n01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:49,850\nI showed this at one point to people\nthat were what juniper training,\n\n1402\n01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:52,200\nand they were specialists with that.\n\n1403\n01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:53,630\nAnd I said okay,\n\n1404\n01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:58,290\nlet's take a look at something because\nI'm not an expert on juniper stuff.\n\n1405\n01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:02,010\nI'll rely on other subject matter\nexperts on that if I need it.\n\n1406\n01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:02,930\nI type it in.\n\n1407\n01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:06,110\nIt says, tell me how many of these\nthings you actually remember.\n\n1408\n01:15:06,110 --> 01:15:07,060\nDoes that look accurate?\n\n1409\n01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,870\nI said, yeah, those are all dead on.\n\n1410\n01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:12,580\nAnd here's the thing,\nif you've enumerated the previous step,\n\n1411\n01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,590\nyou've done your enumeration thoroughly,\nyou may be able to see some things that\n\n1412\n01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:19,180\nhint that there's a default\nconfiguration in place.\n\n1413\n01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,940\nAnd if that's the case, you may be able to\npull something off this list and try it,\n\n1414\n01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:23,330\nand boom you're in.\n\n1415\n01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:24,335\nAbsolutely absolutely.\n\n1416\n01:15:24,335 --> 01:15:27,220\nYeah, like you said it's\ninformation that's out there.\n\n1417\n01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:31,800\nOne way or the other typically I can\nsearch for my router or whatever and\n\n1418\n01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:35,240\nI can go back and find the original\ndocumentation and get this.\n\n1419\n01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:39,920\nBut this is all right there, I can just\nsearch by manufacturer, by model, and\n\n1420\n01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,830\nI can get that default password.\n\n1421\n01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:46,350\nAnd if they haven't done their job and\nhardened those devices, then I'm in.\n\n1422\n01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:49,860\nOr I might even think about resetting\nthe device on some of them.\n\n1423\n01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:52,680\nAlthough then typically we lose some of\nthe configuration that allowed me to gain\n\n1424\n01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,050\naccess to the network.\n\n1425\n01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:59,210\nSo that might not be a possibility, but\nIt could be a great if I could reset\n\n1426\n01:15:59,210 --> 01:16:03,360\nthat device and then login with that admin\npassword and do whatever I wanted with it.\n\n1427\n01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1428\n01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,070\n>> Very good stuff, very good stuff.\n\n1429\n01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:09,890\nAll right.\nAnything else we wanna throw in.\n\n1430\n01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:11,880\nIt's about time for our break.\n\n1431\n01:16:13,146 --> 01:16:16,632\nYou think that's [CROSSTALK]\n>> I think it's a good stopping\n\n1432\n01:16:16,632 --> 01:16:17,240\npoint really.\n\n1433\n01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:17,850\n>> All right.\n\n1434\n01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:19,430\nWell I'll tell you what folks.\n\n1435\n01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:21,310\nWe are going to go ahead and\ntake our break and\n\n1436\n01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:26,550\nwhen we come back we are going to continue\non with gaining access to a system.\n\n1437\n01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:29,482\nWe're going to move on into\nthe world of key stroke or.\n\n1438\n01:16:29,482 --> 01:16:32,360\nKey loggers and then we'll talk about,\n\n1439\n01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,930\nmaybe some privilege\nescalation at some point.\n\n1440\n01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:37,650\nSo, good stuff coming your way.\n\n1441\n01:16:37,650 --> 01:16:38,490\nStay tuned.\n\n1442\n01:16:38,490 --> 01:16:42,725\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n1443\n01:16:42,725 --> 01:16:43,511\n[SOUND]\n\n1444\n01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:46,146\n[MUSIC]\n\n1445\n01:16:46,146 --> 01:16:47,600\nWelcome back ladies and gentleman.\n\n1446\n01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,700\nContinuing with on with\nour gaining access.\n\n1447\n01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,160\nWe lift off getting ready to talk\nabout good old key stroke loggers.\n\n1448\n01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,850\nSo we're going to take a look at that.\n\n1449\n01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:57,650\nAnd key stroke loggers,\ndangerous stuff here,\n\n1450\n01:16:57,650 --> 01:16:59,950\nright, and really easy to get away with.\n\n1451\n01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,770\n>> Yes, that's the thing is\nkey loggers are something\n\n1452\n01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:09,540\nthat can be potentially pretty easy to,\nlike you said, to get away with.\n\n1453\n01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:13,630\nThe thing that we kind of need\nto discuss here is the fact that\n\n1454\n01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:17,280\nkey loggers are not all the same time.\n\n1455\n01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,670\nThere's, there are surveillance devices.\n\n1456\n01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:21,490\nWe can actually expand this out.\n\n1457\n01:17:21,490 --> 01:17:25,220\nThings that could be placed on\na system at this point in time.\n\n1458\n01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:30,030\nWe could have key loggers that\nare literally just intercepting key\n\n1459\n01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:31,790\nstrokes off a system.\n\n1460\n01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:37,090\nWe can have key loggers that\nare hardware based or software based.\n\n1461\n01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:38,520\nBut then, there's stuff outside of that.\n\n1462\n01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,430\nWe've got things that can do screen\ncaptures, we have audio ones.\n\n1463\n01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,890\nOr sometimes they call it acoustical ones.\n\n1464\n01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:48,990\nYou've got ones that turn on\nvideo cameras that can do things.\n\n1465\n01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:55,030\nI mean, there's a lot of variation in that\ncategory, and then there's even stuff that\n\n1466\n01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:01,290\nmonitoring software that's specifically\ndesigned for this purpose.\n\n1467\n01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:04,720\nSo there's a lot of, fun and\ngames to be had here.\n\n1468\n01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:07,960\n>> Yeah, some of those hardware\nbase key strokes loggers, for\n\n1469\n01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,920\nexample, you got Think Geek,\none of my favorite places to go.\n\n1470\n01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,840\nThere's other places that have them.\n\n1471\n01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,330\nI mean, they're no bigger than\na very small thumb drive.\n\n1472\n01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,790\nYou just slip them in between.\n\n1473\n01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:19,840\nThey got PS2 ones from back in the day.\n\n1474\n01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,080\nThey got USB ones now, since most of\nkeyboards and mice are USB based.\n\n1475\n01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,040\nYou just slip that into the back of the\ncomputer where the keyboard's plugging in\n\n1476\n01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,420\nand you plug the keyboard into\nthe back of that hardware piece and\n\n1477\n01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:34,970\nit's capturing every single key\nstroke that's going in and out.\n\n1478\n01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:38,610\nI mean, when's the last time you looked\nat the back of your computer at work?\n\n1479\n01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:41,050\nYou might not even know\nthat thing's there.\n\n1480\n01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:44,870\nAnd they can hold quite a bit of data, and\nothers come back in and pick them up and\n\n1481\n01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,360\ntake them home with them.\n\n1482\n01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:50,940\nAnd then those software ones,\nthat's where it gets really impressive.\n\n1483\n01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:52,270\n>> Yeah.\nThere's so\n\n1484\n01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:54,590\nmany different variations of a theme here.\n\n1485\n01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:55,840\nWhen you talk the hardware and\n\n1486\n01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,150\nsoftware ones, as you were\nmentioning like the hardware ones.\n\n1487\n01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:03,980\nYou can just plug those things\nin the back of a system.\n\n1488\n01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,950\nThey also even have ones that have\nthe ability to be accessed remotely.\n\n1489\n01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:09,440\n>> Yeah, have a little server\nbuilt into them or something.\n\n1490\n01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:12,090\n>> Yeah.\n>> Basically, all you gotta do is pop in\n\n1491\n01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:15,880\nan IP address in a port number and\nthat thing opens up to you.\n\n1492\n01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,360\n>> And it's not like they can detect them.\n\n1493\n01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,870\nBecause all you're doing is getting\nin between the keyboard and\n\n1494\n01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:23,990\nthe mouse that's feeding into\nthat device or that node.\n\n1495\n01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:27,760\nSo you can't detect it from within\nthe system or anything like that.\n\n1496\n01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:30,980\n>> Yeah and that's the thing.\n\n1497\n01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:35,240\nA lot of people consider\nto be the better category,\n\n1498\n01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,080\ngo over software just because when they're\nplugged into the back of a system,\n\n1499\n01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,550\nhow often do people really look at that?\n\n1500\n01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:43,200\nThey don't.\n\n1501\n01:19:43,200 --> 01:19:44,170\nThey just really don't.\n\n1502\n01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:48,480\nSomething like this, you got a notebook or\nwhatever, that's a little different.\n\n1503\n01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:53,530\nBut you're talking a desktop system,\nmost people don't check the back of it.\n\n1504\n01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:56,417\nAnd besides, usually under their desk or\nsomething like that.\n\n1505\n01:19:56,417 --> 01:20:01,459\nAnd even if they did walk right past\nthe system every day and saw that and\n\n1506\n01:20:01,459 --> 01:20:06,675\nwould be able to see the back walking\ninto an office An extra little plug or\n\n1507\n01:20:06,675 --> 01:20:10,011\nsomething in there is\nnot going to be noticed,\n\n1508\n01:20:10,011 --> 01:20:14,120\nespecially if it blends in,\nsame color, all that.\n\n1509\n01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,130\nIt's something that they're\nnot really going to look for.\n\n1510\n01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:20,690\n>> And the only downside of that is you\nwould have to have physical access to\n\n1511\n01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,070\nthat machine, to implant that,\nwhereas with the software base,\n\n1512\n01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:27,680\nI can maybe do that remotely, and as you\nwere saying, I've seen the software base\n\n1513\n01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,960\nkeystroke loggers that every time\nthey click it takes a screenshot,\n\n1514\n01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:35,410\neverything that they click on, everything\nthey open, all logged nice and neat, so\n\n1515\n01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:39,870\neverything they've typed and\nwe're talking about what's the big deal?\n\n1516\n01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:42,186\nWhy do we care if we\ncapture their keystrokes?\n\n1517\n01:20:42,186 --> 01:20:43,562\n>> You should care.\n\n1518\n01:20:43,562 --> 01:20:44,740\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1519\n01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,540\nIt's everything you're typing.\n\n1520\n01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,400\nIt's your password that you're typing in.\n\n1521\n01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,070\nIt's your account number\nthat you're typing in.\n\n1522\n01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,930\nIt's whatever you're typing.\n\n1523\n01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:56,530\nIf you've ever seen the output of these\nit's kind of funny because if somebody\n\n1524\n01:20:56,530 --> 01:20:58,820\nmakes a typo you'll see them spell.\n\n1525\n01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:02,600\nIf they type in hello hello,backspace,\nbackspace, backspace,\n\n1526\n01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,430\nbackspace, you'll see\neverything that they type.\n\n1527\n01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:07,630\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n1528\n01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,860\nYou will be able to see all that.\n\n1529\n01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:12,590\nSomething that also\nshould be brought in and\n\n1530\n01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:18,120\nthis is the key loggers may\nnot be something that you just\n\n1531\n01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:22,760\nPlug in into the back of\na system as a physical device.\n\n1532\n01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:27,080\nIt could be embedded in the actual\nkeyboard or something itself.\n\n1533\n01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:31,360\nYou can go look at things like\nkey ghosts is a popular one.\n\n1534\n01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:36,440\nKey ghost actually make keyboards that\nhave key loggers embedded into them.\n\n1535\n01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:40,400\nAt that point you've really kind\nof changed the rules of the game.\n\n1536\n01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,470\n>> That's just not fair.\n\n1537\n01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:44,950\n>> Yeah,\nat that point you're really are playing\n\n1538\n01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:48,720\nby a whole different set\nof rules at that point and,\n\n1539\n01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,920\nfirst thing, getting it on someone's\nsystem that's really, really easy.\n\n1540\n01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,429\nIf I want to get that in someone's system,\n\n1541\n01:21:55,429 --> 01:21:59,040\nall I got to do is do\na little social engineering.\n\n1542\n01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,240\nI can just put on a little fake badge or\ndress kind of nicely or\n\n1543\n01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:08,190\nwhatever the company dress code is,\nwalk in and bring keyboard in a box and\n\n1544\n01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:13,070\nsay, hey, I'm here to install\nanother ergonomic keyboard for you.\n\n1545\n01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:18,070\nWe ordered one for you, and just make\nup some excuse about, hey it relieves\n\n1546\n01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:22,260\nwrist strain or whatever, no one's\ngoing to pass up free stuff nowadays.\n\n1547\n01:22:22,260 --> 01:22:24,430\nAnd they're like, oh, ergonomic and\nit's going to do this.\n\n1548\n01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:27,060\nOkay, I'm going to get a cup of\ncoffee while you install that.\n\n1549\n01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:30,180\nPop it in, plug it in, and\nleave it and you're done.\n\n1550\n01:22:31,450 --> 01:22:33,699\nAnd they're done too at that point.\n\n1551\n01:22:33,699 --> 01:22:35,995\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's very, very easy to do.\n\n1552\n01:22:35,995 --> 01:22:40,340\nKeygos/s I even believe that the default\none they'll ship you if you want it\n\n1553\n01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:43,800\nIs a Microsoft Natural Keyboard,\none of those old style ones.\n\n1554\n01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:47,240\nBut they will build you a keyboard\nin whatever style you want.\n\n1555\n01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:49,770\n>> That's if you already knew what\nkind of keyboards they were using\n\n1556\n01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:51,450\nin the office and\nyou didn't want it to stand out,\n\n1557\n01:22:51,450 --> 01:22:55,130\nlike why does this person have this\ncrazy keyboard that nobody else has.\n\n1558\n01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:56,700\nBlend in nicely.\n\n1559\n01:22:56,700 --> 01:22:57,240\n>> Yeah.\n\n1560\n01:22:57,240 --> 01:22:57,880\nExactly.\n\n1561\n01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:01,690\nIt'd be very, very easy to slip that by.\n\n1562\n01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:04,780\nThey've changed the rules of it and\n\n1563\n01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:08,940\nsomething else I've mentioned talking\nabout this is the fact that when\n\n1564\n01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:17,300\nyou look at these hardware devices\nthat have embedded key loggers.\n\n1565\n01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:20,410\nOne of the things that works in your\nfavor is the fact that for years,\n\n1566\n01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,952\nyou may have actually seen this yourself.\n\n1567\n01:23:22,952 --> 01:23:23,976\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> For\n\n1568\n01:23:23,976 --> 01:23:29,190\nyears they've had this rumor going\naround that the government was embedding\n\n1569\n01:23:29,190 --> 01:23:31,260\nkey loggers into various\npieces of hardware.\n\n1570\n01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:33,390\nPeople passed that rumor around.\n\n1571\n01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:37,160\nAnd then it got debunked and they said\nno its just not there, some people still\n\n1572\n01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:42,310\nbelieve it but not as many most of them\nlike oh, that's bias, that's not true.\n\n1573\n01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,966\nSo some of where to go look that\nup going could they do that?\n\n1574\n01:23:44,966 --> 01:23:47,640\nThey're probably going to stumble\nas article saying no that's not\n\n1575\n01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:50,220\ntrue I think its even on snope,\nyou can look it up.\n\n1576\n01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:56,570\nSo, those people were verifying\nthat no it's not there\n\n1577\n01:23:56,570 --> 01:24:01,300\nwhen it really is there in a very specific\ncase and they'll probably just oh,\n\n1578\n01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:04,370\nokay the internet says it's not there so\nit must be true.\n\n1579\n01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:07,680\n>> Yeah, absolutely, because if it's\non the internet it has to be true.\n\n1580\n01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:08,420\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1581\n01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,680\n>> I'm a French bottle.\n\n1582\n01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:13,460\nBonjour.\nWe've got a good question out there.\n\n1583\n01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:15,180\nWhat if companies used them for employees?\n\n1584\n01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:16,640\nIs that legal?\n\n1585\n01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:21,180\nThat's going to vary from\nsituation to situation.\n\n1586\n01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:26,590\nLike David said,\nif the computer is there's.\n\n1587\n01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:30,720\nYou have to check your\nlocal laws in the US.\n\n1588\n01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:32,530\nEven if I'm using a company computer,\n\n1589\n01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:38,360\nI have a certain Expectancy\nof privacy that I can get.\n\n1590\n01:24:38,360

from\n\n1615\n01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:02,920\narea to area so\nyou'd have to check your local laws.\n\n1616\n01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,760\n>> I'd even factor in there\nIf you think about it,\n\n1617\n01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,650\nis it reasonable that a company\nwould have a key-logger in there?\n\n1618\n01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:12,040\n>> For\nevery single system on their

--> 01:26:22,150\nhardware key-logger installed on all\ntheir stuff as part of due course.\n\n1622\n01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:24,140\nThen no,\nthere's expectation of privacy there,\n\n1623\n01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:26,940\nbecause it's not something normally be\nthere, so an employee's not going to\n\n1624\n01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:31,080\nthink it's there, and\ntherefore you've invaded their privacy.\n\n1625\n01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,120\nYeah, I know it's kind of frustrating and\n\n1626\n01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:37,430\nstuff like that, but\nit's something that does occur.\n\n1627\n01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:42,750\n>> And James mentioned here,\nwhat about acceptable use policy?\n\n1628\n01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:43,900\nAcceptable use policy?\n\n1629\n01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:49,513\nYeah it, it, it can come into play there,\nbut it has to be explicitly called out.\n\n1630\n01:26:49,513 --> 01:26:54,522\nAnd there has been a mention\nthat DOD have a banner there,\n\n1631\n01:26:54,522 --> 01:26:56,335\nyes they do, they absolutely do.\n\n1632\n01:26:56,335 --> 01:27:01,405\n>> Yeah, and that's a situation where then\nyou've lost your expectation of privacy\n\n1633\n01:27:01,405 --> 01:27:05,515\nbecause they've got a banner that says, If\nyou use this system we are monitoring you.\n\n1634\n01:27:07,145 --> 01:27:12,695\nThat way I don't have an expectation\nthat this is private in any way and\n\n1635\n01:27:12,695 --> 01:27:13,225\nthen it's legal.\n\n1636\n01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,850\n>> Chris has set these up nicely for\nour next section

mean, because, you know, we talk about\nhardware key log or software key loggers\n\n1643\n01:27:30,385 --> 01:27:34,285\nare just something that monitors\nthe software keystrokes, so it's going on.\n\n1644\n01:27:34,285 --> 01:27:39,635\nBut then you think of, well,\nif I'm not typing it in,\n\n1645\n01:27:39,635 --> 01:27:45,225\nwhat happens, you know, if I can somehow\nclick buttons on screen or nowadays, I've\n\n1646\n01:27:45,225 --> 01:27:50,280\ngot touch screen on here, you just tap the\nstuff on there, not getting caught right?\n\n1647\n01:27:50,280 --> 01:27:53,292\nWrong they can get caught.\n\n1648\n01:27:53,292 --> 01:27:57,347\nIf you want to do it the easy way, go into\nany Windows version from Vista forward\n\n1649\n01:27:57,347 --> 01:28:01,167\nthere is actually something in there\ncalled the Problem Steps recorded.\n\n1650\n01:28:01,167 --> 01:28:07,321\nIt's been built in as part of a standard\nfeature All that does is that whenever\n\n1651\n01:28:07,321 --> 01:28:14,130\nthere is a button click or a key tap, it\ntakes a snapshot of what's on the screen.\n\n1652\n01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:16,890\nSo just focus on that for a second.\n\n1653\n01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:19,550\nAny time there is a button click.\n\n1654\n01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:23,150\nYou click your mouse and\nit's taking a snapshot of the screen?\n\n1655\n01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:28,246\nI've just shot that whole\nvirtual keyboard down.\n\n1656\n01:28:28,246 --> 01:28:30,680\nWhat the problem stops recorder\nwill do is every time you tap that,\n\n1657\n01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:31,560\nit takes a snapshot.\n\n1658\n01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:37,290\nIt will bundle it to a file and\nyou can extract that file from the system.\n\n1659\n01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:39,860\nThat has the benefit, by the way,\nof also being something,\n\n1660\n01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:41,420\nsince it's a built-in feature of Windows.\n\n1661\n01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:45,380\nIt's supposed to be there, it won't\nget detected by a malware scanners.\n\n1662\n01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,430\nIt's supposed to be there.\n\n1663\n01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:54,490\nAnd it will keep track of the last\n100 button clicks on the system.\n\n1664\n01:28:54,490 --> 01:28:56,888\nIt has a circular logging-type deal.\n\n1665\n01:28:56,888 --> 01:29:01,770\nIt hits 100, next one will start at one\nand overwrite that one, so it keeps going.\n\n1666\n01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:05,200\nThat feature, by the way, was originally\ndesigned for trouble shooting purposes.\n\n1667\n01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,530\n>> Yes, and it works great for that.\n\n1668\n01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:09,289\n>> Yeah, if someone calls you up and\nyou're a tech person.\n\n1669\n01:29:09,289 --> 01:29:12,000\nSomeone calls up and\nwe've all had that situation.\n\n1670\n01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,470\nOr someone calls up and\n\n1671\n01:29:13,470 --> 01:29:18,870\ndoesn't really know how to articulate\nwhat's happening on their system.\n\n1672\n01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:21,400\nWe know that occurs, so\nthis is to make it easier.\n\n1673\n01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:25,030\nWe tell them just start up this feature,\ndo whatever it does that causes\n\n1674\n01:29:25,030 --> 01:29:30,985\nthe problem, and then grab this file, and\nsend it to me, and I'll help you out.\n\n1675\n01:29:30,985 --> 01:29:34,425\n>> I love it, cuz you guys, those of\nyou that have done tech support or\n\n1676\n01:29:34,425 --> 01:29:36,365\nhelpdesk before know the deal.\n\n1677\n01:29:36,365 --> 01:29:37,505\nHi, my computer got an error.\n\n1678\n01:29:37,505 --> 01:29:38,960\nWhat did the error say?\n\n1679\n01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,680\nI don't know.\nI clicked OK.\n\n1680\n01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:44,310\nAnd so by using that problem step\nrecorder, I get to actually see the error,\n\n1681\n01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:45,330\nthings like that.\n\n1682\n01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,010\nAnd Brian kinda beat me to\nthe punch there with his comment.\n\n1683\n01:29:48,010 --> 01:29:50,790\nHe says, if the software keyboard\ntalks through the same API.\n\n1684\n01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:54,230\nBecause if it's a hardware\nbased keystroke logger,\n\n1685\n01:29:54,230 --> 01:29:57,240\nit might not capture touch screen\ntype inputs or something like that.\n\n1686\n01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:01,520\nBut if it's software based,\nthen it's still seeing those keystrokes\n\n1687\n01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:06,010\nwhether it's used with a tactile keyboard,\nwhether it's an on-screen keyboard,\n\n1688\n01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:10,080\nwhether it's one of those fancy projection\nkeyboards and things like that.\n\n1689\n01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:15,200\nIt still, at some point, is a keystroke\nthat the system is reading as a keystroke.\n\n1690\n01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,690\nSo that's where that software based stuff,\nit doesn't care\n\n1691\n01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:22,480\nhow the thing got originated,\nit's a keystroke, it's gonna capture it.\n\n1692\n01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:23,120\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1693\n01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,740\n>> It doesn't really matter.\n\n1694\n01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:29,790\n>> Yeah, you'll find that they've already\nthought about a lot of these things,\n\n1695\n01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:33,620\nso, you guys are correct\non bringing this stuff up.\n\n1696\n01:30:33,620 --> 01:30:37,185\nAnd say, a virtual keyboard,\nwhat about that?\n\n1697\n01:30:37,185 --> 01:30:39,540\nYeah, what about it?\n\n1698\n01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:41,450\nWe've already accounted for it.\n\n1699\n01:30:41,450 --> 01:30:43,090\nSo it's great that you're\nthinking about it.\n\n1700\n01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:47,720\nThis is what you have to think as pen\ntesters, what about this, what about this.\n\n1701\n01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:50,320\nThat's exactly the process that\nyou should be going through, so\n\n1702\n01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:51,600\ngood call on that one.\n\n1703\n01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,820\n>> All right, all right.\n\n1704\n01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:56,852\nAnd the problem of separate quarters,\nwhat Shawn was referring to,\n\n1705\n01:30:56,852 --> 01:31:00,435\nit's kinda hidden and they don't make\nit really obviously that it's in there.\n\n1706\n01:31:00,435 --> 01:31:03,550\nBut it's been in there since Vista and\nit's a pretty cool thing for\n\n1707\n01:31:03,550 --> 01:31:07,850\nhelpdesk work for sure and then of course,\nit can be used maliciously as well,\n\n1708\n01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:09,330\nlike most things.\n\n1709\n01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:15,630\nSo you have keystroke loggers, keyloggers,\ndifferent types, software based, hardware\n\n1710\n01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:20,670\nbased, lots of different ways that we\ncan capture that input information.\n\n1711\n01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:22,500\nWithout that user,\nlike the software bases.\n\n1712\n01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,420\nThose guys you can get ones\nthat melt their install files.\n\n1713\n01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:30,240\nThat don't run in the, obviously you don't\nwant it to pop up in the system tray.\n\n1714\n01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,960\nThey can be very,\nvery stealthy if set up properly.\n\n1715\n01:31:33,960 --> 01:31:36,790\nWhat else did we wanna\nmention about those?\n\n1716\n01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:38,890\nAnything we haven't hit on that?\n\n1717\n01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:43,810\n>> Just remember that they've got, and\nfor keyloggers, they do actually include\n\n1718\n01:31:43,810 --> 01:31:46,980\nlike I said, acoustical ones that will\nlisten to what's going on in the area.\n\n1719\n01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:55,270\nAnd they have ones that are video,\nthat can observe certain things.\n\n1720\n01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:57,550\nThey still won't throw those\nin the area of keyloggers.\n\n1721\n01:31:57,550 --> 01:32:00,990\nAnd they're all just as dangerous.\n\n1722\n01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:05,230\nSo, don't forget that they can take many,\nmany, many different forms.\n\n1723\n01:32:05,230 --> 01:32:10,000\nAnd with all the little doohickies and\ngadgets attached to systems nowadays, and\n\n1724\n01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,470\nembedded in there,\nit gives us a lot of ways to do that.\n\n1725\n01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:17,910\nI mean heck, they even have ones for,\nthis isn't covered on the exam, but\n\n1726\n01:32:17,910 --> 01:32:21,500\nthere's another, there's one that\nthey've even built for smart phones.\n\n1727\n01:32:21,500 --> 01:32:26,180\nFor those of you that use\ngestures to unlock your keyboard.\n\n1728\n01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:30,690\nI mean first of all a simple\nkey logger with a smart phone.\n\n1729\n01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:35,330\nA simple crude keylogger,\nif you will, so the fact that if I'm\n\n1730\n01:32:35,330 --> 01:32:40,270\ntyping my password on here, grease\nfrom my fingerprints are left there.\n\n1731\n01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:44,570\nSo, the other thing you have in that is,\nwhat if someone's using that swipe.\n\n1732\n01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:49,460\nThey say read the grease, but what if I'm\ntyping stuff, a bunch of stuff on there.\n\n1733\n01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:53,710\nHeck I could of had fries for\nlunch and done that.\n\n1734\n01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:55,504\nWhich I didn't, by the way.\n\n1735\n01:32:55,504 --> 01:32:57,790\nBut what if all that stuff happened?\n\n1736\n01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:03,380\nSomeone has written an app for this, and\nit has absolutely been done, no kidding.\n\n1737\n01:33:03,380 --> 01:33:06,954\nThey have a,\nthere is an actual stuff in here for\n\n1738\n01:33:06,954 --> 01:33:09,670\nmotion detectors built into these things.\n\n1739\n01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:11,990\nSo this device gets\nmoved even a little bit.\n\n1740\n01:33:11,990 --> 01:33:15,610\nAll of us know that heck, I've got\nan astronomy app in here that I can\n\n1741\n01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:18,370\nturn the GPS and\nhold it up and track the sky.\n\n1742\n01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:23,360\nIt's a very common thing for\ndevices to have that.\n\n1743\n01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:26,950\nThose motion detectors in these\ndevices aren't protected.\n\n1744\n01:33:26,950 --> 01:33:30,830\nNo one ever thought when they designed\nthese things of being misused.\n\n1745\n01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:35,680\nSo someone built an app that accesses\nthose motion detectors in here.\n\n1746\n01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:36,230\n>> That's clever.\n\n1747\n01:33:36,230 --> 01:33:40,380\n>> And so when you're drawing your little\nswipe stuff, it picks up little almost\n\n1748\n01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:44,490\nimperceptible movements of the device when\nyou're swiping your finger across it and\n\n1749\n01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:49,290\ncan reconstruct that swipe pattern and\nsend it back to whoever.\n\n1750\n01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,590\n>> Yeah, that's amazing.\n\n1751\n01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:52,680\nAnd that whole picture\npassword that Microsoft and\n\n1752\n01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,860\nseveral people have started to\nimplement on different systems.\n\n1753\n01:33:55,860 --> 01:33:58,130\nPeople think it's impervious\nto being attacked and\n\n1754\n01:33:58,130 --> 01:34:00,860\ncouldn't be further from\nthe truth as you say.\n\n1755\n01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,270\nIt's still susceptible\nto shoulder serving.\n\n1756\n01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,960\nI know Nate's password over there.\n\n1757\n01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:07,440\nI don't know if he knows I know it,\nbut I know his password.\n\n1758\n01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,510\nHis picture password away.\n\n1759\n01:34:09,510 --> 01:34:11,550\nAnd like you say.\n>> It's documented on the air now,\n\n1760\n01:34:11,550 --> 01:34:12,720\nyou can't deny it.\n\n1761\n01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:15,350\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1762\n01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,280\nI know like you said,\n\n1763\n01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,760\nyou get the smudge patterns on the screen.\n\n1764\n01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:24,352\nSo either you keep your screen really,\nreally clean and wipe it down religiously,\n\n1765\n01:34:24,352 --> 01:34:28,614\nor just let it build up all over the place\nto try to prevent them from seeing your\n\n1766\n01:34:28,614 --> 01:34:29,650\npattern.\n\n1767\n01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:32,461\n>> Just scrape the crust off every now and\nthen.\n\n1768\n01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:34,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean come on!\n\n1769\n01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:35,115\nLet's not get gross.\n\n1770\n01:34:35,115 --> 01:34:36,730\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've head of stories,\n\n1771\n01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:37,930\nI've never tried this myself.\n\n1772\n01:34:37,930 --> 01:34:41,990\nI've heard of stories of people taking\nTide which has some phosphorus in it,\n\n1773\n01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:47,000\nwhich is gonna glow under a black light,\nand they'll make a liquid solution and\n\n1774\n01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,660\npaint it on the hand rail\non the way up to the door.\n\n1775\n01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:52,800\nPeople get that on their hands and\nas they touch the keypad going\n\n1776\n01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,770\ninto the front door, everybody's\nhitting those same buttons, right?\n\n1777\n01:34:57,770 --> 01:34:59,250\nSo if I take a blacklight up to that,\n\n1778\n01:34:59,250 --> 01:35:02,840\nI can see which buttons are being pressed,\nfour, five digits or whatever it is,\n\n1779\n01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,150\nand the darkest one will\nbe the first one they hit.\n\n1780\n01:35:05,150 --> 01:35:08,840\nThe lightest one would be\nthe last one they hit.\n\n1781\n01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,384\nThese guys are sneaky.\n\n1782\n01:35:10,384 --> 01:35:16,740\n>> We say about doing that with keypads\nand tracking it with the blacklight.\n\n1783\n01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:17,700\nThe next episode I will be lowered in\nfrom strings like Mission Impossible.\n\n1784\n01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:18,941\n[LAUGH] I want that, that sounds.\n\n1785\n01:35:18,941 --> 01:35:21,008\n[MUSIC]\n\n1786\n01:35:21,008 --> 01:35:26,490\n>> [LAUGH] Oh shoot.\n\n1787\n01:35:26,490 --> 01:35:29,250\nWell I tell you Shawn, this is\nreally looking like a good place to,\n\n1788\n01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:31,210\ndo we wanna go into our next topic yet?\n\n1789\n01:35:33,130 --> 01:35:33,893\n>> What are you thinking?\n\n1790\n01:35:33,893 --> 01:35:34,830\nI had a good one coming up.\n\n1791\n01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:37,010\nI don't know if I want to\ntell the users about it yet.\n\n1792\n01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:37,910\nOur viewers.\n\n1793\n01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:39,016\n>> Yeah, it's a secret.\n\n1794\n01:35:39,016 --> 01:35:41,788\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1795\n01:35:41,788 --> 01:35:44,900\n>> I'll tell you what, let's do this.\n\n1796\n01:35:44,900 --> 01:35:48,520\nThis is probably a good place for\nus to go ahead and\n\n1797\n01:35:48,520 --> 01:35:50,270\ncall it on this particular episode.\n\n1798\n01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:53,470\nSo let's go ahead and\nwrap it here I think and\n\n1799\n01:35:53,470 --> 01:35:55,100\nthen we'll move on into our\nnext one on our next episode.\n\n1800\n01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:56,910\n>> Yeah we got a big topic coming up.\n\n1801\n01:35:56,910 --> 01:36:01,560\nSo we might as well just end this one and\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n1802\n01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:04,370\nstart that one in the new episode.\n\n1803\n01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:05,670\n>> Sounds like a good plan.\n\n1804\n01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,400\n>> We'll just chill to the next episode.\n\n1805\n01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,190\n>> There we go.\n[LAUGH] Ladies and gentleman,\n\n1806\n01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:12,470\ngreat episode here, loved it.\n\n1807\n01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:17,320\nWe started our gaining access to a system,\nwhich was chapter seven in Shawn's book,\n\n1808\n01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,380\nThe CEH Study Guide, for version eight.\n\n1809\n01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:22,810\nWe learned about what we meant\nby gaining access to a system.\n\n1810\n01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,840\nAnd we talked a little bit\nabout password cracking,\n\n1811\n01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:28,650\nthe different methodologies that we\ncould use to obtain those passwords,\n\n1812\n01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:33,770\npassive online, active online,\noffline and not electronic.\n\n1813\n01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:36,670\nAnd then we rounded things off with\nthis one talking about the various\n\n1814\n01:36:36,670 --> 01:36:39,570\nforms that keyloggers come in and\nremember,\n\n1815\n01:36:39,570 --> 01:36:44,060\none of the important things Shawn stressed\nto you, don't think just key strokes.\n\n1816\n01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,820\nThese do much more than that nowadays.\n\n1817\n01:36:45,820 --> 01:36:49,200\nAnd when they say keyloggers,\nthey're really incorporating or\n\n1818\n01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:53,080\nencompassing all of that,\nincluding audio capture, video capture,\n\n1819\n01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:56,320\nscreen cap, screen shots,\nand things like that.\n\n1820\n01:36:57,820 -->

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:38,170\nWelcome to another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:41,410\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,670\nHow are you, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,840\n>> I'm doing fine.\n\n9\n00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,200\n>> He's doing fine, good, good.\n\n10\n00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,910\nWe are here to do another\nepisode of the CEH program,\n\n11\n00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,460\nand we're going over Sean's book,\nand I've lost my prop.\n\n12\n00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,350\nLet me bend out of camera here for\na second.\n\n13\n00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,080\nWe're gonna do Sean's book, CEH: Certified\nEthical Hacker Version 8 Study Guide.\n\n14\n00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,036\nSo if you haven't gone out and picked that\nup yet, go ahead and get a copy of that.\n\n15\n00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,302\n>> And pay full price.\n\n16\n00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:09,084\n>> [LAUGH] You guys can just\ngo to Amazon and grab that,\n\n17\n00:01:09,084 --> 00:01:12,970\nor you can get the electronic version for\nyour Kindle.\n\n18\n00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,140\nSo we are in the middle of\ndoing gaining system access,\n\n19\n00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,540\nwhich if I remember right\nSean is chapter seven.\n\n20\n00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,530\nThis is part two of our gaining access or\ngaining access to a system.\n\n21\n00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,910\nSo if you missed the first part,\nmake sure you go back and check that out.\n\n22\n00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,510\nWe are gonna pick it up\nwith privilege escalation.\n\n23\n00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,650\nSo we've talked about\ntrying to gain access.\n\n24\n00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,010\nIn the previous episode we\nlooked at cracking passwords and\n\n25\n00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,050\nways we might get our\nbasic access to a system.\n\n26\n00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,820\nBut once we get that access, depending\non that account that we've cracked,\n\n27\n00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,390\nmight not have the level\nof access that we want,\n\n28\n00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,160\nwhich is where our privilege\nescalation is gonna come into play.\n\n29\n00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n30\n00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,030\nYou know, if you think about what\nwe did in our previous steps,\n\n31\n00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,550\nour previous part of our gain access step,\n\n32\n00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,720\nwe hopefully obtained a password.\n\n33\n00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,590\nNow the thing is,\nis that with that password,\n\n34\n00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,380\nwhat are you gonna have access to?\n\n35\n00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,920\nMore than likely, the account that\nyou're gonna compromise is not gonna\n\n36\n00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,290\nhave the privileges that you want\nto fully carry out the attack.\n\n37\n00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,035\nIf it does, hey, good for you.\n\n38\n00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:24,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're able to move to the next step.\n\n39\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,190\nBut you're probably not gonna have\nthe level of privileges you want to fully\n\n40\n00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,880\ncarry out or\nexecute whatever plans you have.\n\n41\n00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,650\nSo you're going to need to\nobtain those privileges\n\n42\n00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,490\nthrough a process called\nprivilege escalation.\n\n43\n00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:42,640\nSo, privilege escalation is getting higher\nprivileges than you currently have, with\n\n44\n00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,580\nthe intent that once you get those, you\ncan carry out something more dangerous,\n\n45\n00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,340\nor carry out something that you originally\nintended to do, like plant software on\n\n46\n00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,870\nthe system, change the configuration, or\ndo something that has a greater impact.\n\n47\n00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,302\n>> Right, right.\n\n48\n00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:02,560\nAll right, so if we want to get more\naccess, get a higher level of access, so\n\n49\n00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,460\nwe can maybe install software, gain access\nto resources where the access is limited,\n\n50\n00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,330\nor something like that,\nhow do we go about this?\n\n51\n00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:11,870\n>> This is cool.\n\n52\n00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,760\nYou've got a whole ton of things\nin your toolbox at this point.\n\n53\n00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,535\nFirst of all,\nto find two types of privilege escalation,\n\n54\n00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:23,720\ncuz not all privilege escalations are the\nsame, there's actually a horizontal and\n\n55\n00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,880\na vertical privilege escalation.\n\n56\n00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,090\nThe horizontal means you have\nan account that you've compromised, and\n\n57\n00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,760\nnow you're gonna increase privileges of\nthat account til you have what you want.\n\n58\n00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,670\nEntirely possible to do.\n\n59\n00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:42,310\nThen you have the horizontal one, which\nmeans that you compromise one account,\n\n60\n00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,120\nand then you compromise another account,\nand then another account, another account,\n\n61\n00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,310\nwith increasing privileges until\nyou have the one you want that way.\n\n62\n00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,224\n>> So vertical escalation means I'm\ngonna stick with the account that I've\n\n63\n00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:56,608\ncompromised and I'm just gonna increase\nthe rights and privileges of that account.\n\n64\n00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:57,835\n>> Did I say horizontal for both?\n\n65\n00:03:57,835 --> 00:03:58,380\n>> I think so.\n>> All right,\n\n66\n00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,089\nwell you guys know what I meant.\n\n67\n00:03:59,089 --> 00:03:59,867\n>> We knew what you meant, yeah.\n\n68\n00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,841\nSo, vertical meaning I'm going\nto take that one account and\n\n69\n00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:06,650\njust increase the rights and\nprivileges associated with it.\n\n70\n00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,320\nHorizontal, meaning I'm going\nto start with one account, and\n\n71\n00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,200\nthen find other accounts that have an\nincreasingly greater amount of access, or\n\n72\n00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,810\na higher level of privilege.\n\n73\n00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,370\n>> Absolutely.\n\n74\n00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,100\n>> All right.\n\n75\n00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,790\n>> So now that we know those two\ntypes of privilege escalation,\n\n76\n00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,350\nthe question is,\nhow do you carry those out?\n\n77\n00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,820\nWell it depends on what you\nopenings you have at this point, or\n\n78\n00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,420\nhow aggressive you wanna be.\n\n79\n00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,120\nAgain, you've got plenty of options.\n\n80\n00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,110\nWe've got tools that can help us with it,\nor if you have some sort of access to\n\n81\n00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,120\nthe system,\nthere's tools that can help you there.\n\n82\n00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,830\nFor example, there's one that's actually\nquite fascinating when you see it.\n\n83\n00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,710\nYou can do it in, really,\nall the current versions of Windows.\n\n84\n00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,500\nWhat it involves is,\nyou get access to a system,\n\n85\n00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,750\nand once you get access to a system,\n\n86\n00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,430\nwhat you will do is you will\nstart manipulating it a bit.\n\n87\n00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,460\nAnd the first thing you do is,\n\n88\n00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,870\nthere's a feature on every Windows\nsystem called Sticky Keys.\n\n89\n00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,760\nIt's an accessibility feature.\n\n90\n00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,610\nYou can go out there and you tap\nthe shift key five times in a certain\n\n91\n00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:20,740\namount of time and it will bring up this\ndialog saying, do you wanna turn this on?\n\n92\n00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,430\nWell there's a file in the system called\nsethc.exe that takes care of that.\n\n93\n00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,681\nAnd the system is designed that when you\ngo tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap,\n\n94\n00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:37,573\nthe system intercepts those key strokes\nand fires it off to this executable.\n\n95\n00:05:37,573 --> 00:05:40,170\nAll it's doing is looking for\nthat executable.\n\n96\n00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:46,014\nSo what we can do if we have\ncredentials to that system already,\n\n97\n00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:49,986\nwe can take something like the cmd.exe and\n\n98\n00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:55,968\nreplace the sethc.exe with\na renamed version of the cmd.exe.\n\n99\n00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,450\nCuz all the system's doing\nis it's gonna say okay,\n\n100\n00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,900\ngo get that file name,\njust rename the cmd.exe to that file name.\n\n101\n00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,940\nOnce you've got that,\nwhat will happen is, tap tap tap,\n\n102\n00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:12,975\nit goes to that cmd.exe that's been\nrenamed, opens up a command prompt.\n\n103\n00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:17,105\nThat command prompt actually\nhas administrative privileges.\n\n104\n00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:22,975\nSo once you've got that, you can run some\ncommands to create accounts on the system.\n\n105\n00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,075\nIn fact, the accounts you\ncreate in the system, you can\n\n106\n00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:30,895\ncreate an administrator level account on\nthat local system, have it in place, and\n\n107\n00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:35,305\nthen do some modifications to\nthe system to hide that user account.\n\n108\n00:06:35,305 --> 00:06:36,810\nMost people aren't aware of that.\n\n109\n00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,790\nThat you can actually go into a Windows\nsystem, and with a couple quick edits of\n\n110\n00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:47,130\nthe registry, you can hide any user\naccount to where they're still usable,\n\n111\n00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,295\nbut they're not viewable through\nnormal means if you are using\n\n112\n00:06:52,295 --> 00:06:57,075\nthe consoles and stuff like that, you\nspecifically have to know how to find it.\n\n113\n00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,695\n>> Yeah, and\nwe've got a comment in the chat room,\n\n114\n00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:01,385\nFabian says it's one\nof his favorite hacks.\n\n115\n00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:05,200\nAnd I'd have to agree that It's amazing\nthat it hasn't been patched, but\n\n116\n00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,660\nat the same time,\nit's understandable why it hasn't,\n\n117\n00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,510\nbecause the system has to be ready for\nthat.\n\n118\n00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,100\nFrom the log on screen, before you log\non to the Windows system, there's that\n\n119\n00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,950\naccessibility option button down in\nthe bottom left hand corner, right?\n\n120\n00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,503\nSo if somebody needs those accessibility\noptions, they can click on that for\n\n121\n00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:21,441\nthe log in process.\n\n122\n00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,390\nSo that has to be able to run before\nauthentication has ever occurred.\n\n123\n00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,230\nIt doesn't know who you are at this point.\n\n124\n00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,410\nYou click that and\nthat's executing something.\n\n125\n00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,750\nSo if I can take a Linux distro or\nsomething like this and\n\n126\n00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,600\nreboot that system, I can access that\nhard drive and, as Sean's saying,\n\n127\n00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:43,912\nreplace the accessibility executable\nwith a renamed copy of the cmd.exe.\n\n128\n00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:44,660\nAnd I've done this and\n\n129\n00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,240\nyou're sitting there looking at a command\nprompt on top of the log on screen.\n\n130\n00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,728\nAnd you can start opening up explorer.exe,\nand you can fire up Explorer, and\n\n131\n00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:56,380\nin the background is\nthe actual log on screen.\n\n132\n00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,250\nIt's pretty crazy.\n\n133\n00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,917\nAnd one quick thing, I want to go back,\nMichaela has a question there and I want\n\n134\n00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:05,550\nto make sure that I did that right when\nI was summarizing what you were saying.\n\n135\n00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,870\nVertical and horizontal,\ncan you explain that one more time?\n\n136\n00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,520\nWhich one was vertical and\nwhich one was horizontal?\n\n137\n00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,289\n>> Yeah.\nVertical means you have an account\n\n138\n00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,510\nthat's compromised, and\n\n139\n00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,680\nonce you compromise that account you bump\nup the privileges on that single account.\n\n140\n00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,630\nHorizontal means that you\ncompromise one account, and then\n\n141\n00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,730\nhop from that account to another account\nto another account, basically back and\n\n142\n00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,310\nforth all the way until you get something\nthat has the privileges you want.\n\n143\n00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,990\n>> Okay.\nSo I might have said that backwards, then,\n\n144\n00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,540\nso make sure we've got that correct.\n\n145\n00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,500\nVertical, single account, escalating\nthose credentials on that single account.\n\n146\n00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,720\nHorizontal, jumping from\none account to the other.\n\n147\n00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,800\nEach account having\na greater level of access.\n\n148\n00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,590\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n149\n00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,210\n>> Okay.\n>> That's what the process would entail.\n\n150\n00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:48,770\n>> Good deal.\n\n151\n00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:49,570\nGood deal.\n\n152\n00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,530\n>> And then to add on just a couple\nmore steps to this process.\n\n153\n00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:53,739\nWe went through the sticky keys.\n\n154\n00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:03,520\nWhat's gonna happen if you do that is\nyou're gonna compromise the local box.\n\n155\n00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,064\nYou're not anywhere, if you [INAUDIBLE]\nadministrator account pr anything,\n\n156\n00:09:05,064 --> 00:09:08,230\nyou're not going on to the actual\nnetwork at this point.\n\n157\n00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,340\nYou are still on that local system.\n\n158\n00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,900\nSo you have to think of a way to actually\n\n159\n00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,080\nget the credentials of someone that\nwould have the access you want.\n\n160\n00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,990\nAnd so, what you do at that\npoint is log in the system,\n\n161\n00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,020\ninstall a keylogger and then just wait.\n\n162\n00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,060\nAnd eventually, if you've chosen\nthe right system or if you're very,\n\n163\n00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,560\nvery lucky, someone's gonna log in.\n\n164\n00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,090\nAnd boom,\nyou're gonna have those credentials,\n\n165\n00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,820\nnow you can step onto the network.\n\n166\n00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,620\nAnd if you notice what's happened here,\n\n167\n00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,520\nwe've gotten to the point\nwhere we compromised\n\n168\n00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,570\na lesser privileged account enough where\nwe could do some renaming of files.\n\n169\n00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,890\nAnd then we're able to launch something\nwith administrator privileges, so\n\n170\n00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,600\nwe did a vertical and got administrator\nprivileges on that local box,\n\n171\n00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,940\ncreated our self an administrator account\nthere and then what we did is we installed\n\n172\n00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,440\na keylogger, waited for someone with\ndomain admin privileges to come in.\n\n173\n00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,185\nAnd then we just, it would jump over\nbasically in a horizontal escalation\n\n174\n00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,895\nover to the domain or what have you.\n\n175\n00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:11,995\n>> So kind of brought both\nof those methods into play.\n\n176\n00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:13,085\n>> Yeah.\n>> At that point.\n\n177\n00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,155\n>> Yeah, you can mix and match.\n\n178\n00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,775\nYou can definitely mix and\nmatch to get your result.\n\n179\n00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,265\nAnd that still does work.\n\n180\n00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:19,735\nBut you know the sad thing about it is,\n\n181\n00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:24,880\nis that there's plenty of ways that\nMicrosoft could have fixed that.\n\n182\n00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,240\nEasy way I can think of is\ndigitally sign that file.\n\n183\n00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,740\n>> Right.\n\n184\n00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,810\n>> Once I digitally sign a sethc.exe,\n\n185\n00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,090\nyou can rename cmd.exe to\nsethd.exe all you want.\n\n186\n00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,420\nIt won't work.\n\n187\n00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,505\nSignature's not the same.\n\n188\n00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,835\nWe know how signatures work already.\n\n189\n00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:42,315\nYou know why it won't work.\n\n190\n00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:44,005\n>> Right, right.\n\n191\n00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:44,558\nAll right.\nSo,\n\n192\n00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:47,243\nwhat are some other ways we could then\nmaybe if we're doing that vertical\n\n193\n00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,905\nreason that same account.\n\n194\n00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:53,760\nHow do we go about escalating that account\nor where do we wanna go next with this,\n\n195\n00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,490\nwith our privilege?\n\n196\n00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,030\nDo you want to start taking\na look at some tools or?\n\n197\n00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,980\n>> Well it's a question.\n\n198\n00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,590\nOnce you've gotten access to\nthe local box and then, from there,\n\n199\n00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,440\nthe network, the world's your oyster,\nI guess, as they say.\n\n200\n00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,413\n>> Right.\n>> You can pretty much do whatever you\n\n201\n00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:10,412\nwant at that point.\n\n202\n00:11:10,412 --> 00:11:12,660\nYou've opened up a lot of doors.\n\n203\n00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,380\nWho knows, maybe the next step is\nif you've got a domain account.\n\n204\n00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,490\nYou get a domain account that doesn't\nhave the privileges you want there.\n\n205\n00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,400\nNow, you get to rinse and\nrepeat the process where\n\n206\n00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,190\nyou try to get access to an account\nthat does have what you want.\n\n207\n00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,980\nYou're enumerating the accounts.\n\n208\n00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,440\nNow that can be kind of a tricky part\n\n209\n00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,080\nthere because one of the things that\ncomes into play when you're looking for\n\n210\n00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,480\nuser accounts is there's all\ndifferent names for user accounts.\n\n211\n00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,880\nPeople do all sorts of crazy things and\n\n212\n00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,610\none of the things you can do\nis attach every user account.\n\n213\n00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,940\nAs you may know,\nthere's something called a SID.\n\n214\n00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,540\nA security identifier.\n\n215\n00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,050\nWell, SIDs are a long\n\n216\n00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,790\nkinda gobbledygook number or\nalphanumeric code that you'll see.\n\n217\n00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,350\nThey've got a lot of dashes and\nstuff like that on it.\n\n218\n00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,110\nEvery group of numbers in there, in\nthe sequence means something specific and\n\n219\n00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,088\nyou can look all those things\nup in Microsoft's documentation.\n\n220\n00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,073\nYeah, you probably don't care.\n\n221\n00:12:11,073 --> 00:12:11,960\n>> [LAUGH] You don't really care.\n\n222\n00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,670\n>> Yeah, you probably don't care unless\nthat's a really big issue to you or\n\n223\n00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,040\nyou're just bored.\n\n224\n00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,345\nOr you need to go to sleep.\n\n225\n00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:19,515\n>> Dash one dash five dash nine,\nblah, blah, blah yeah.\n\n226\n00:12:19,515 --> 00:12:22,900\n>> Don't want to take sleeping pills,\nwant to go all natural, there you go,\n\n227\n00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,270\nread that.\n\n228\n00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,590\nSo the thing is that there is\nsomething of importance in those SIDs\n\n229\n00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:34,410\nsince every account has a SID assigned\nto it, and they have different names.\n\n230\n00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,240\nOr the different names in accounts.\n\n231\n00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,170\nYou can quickly determine by\nextracting a SID from an account,\n\n232\n00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:41,058\nwhat type of account it actually is.\n\n233\n00:12:41,058 --> 00:12:43,330\nIf you, and I'll let you Google that.\n\n234\n00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,400\nI won't put it up here onscreen\nbecause it'll be tough to read, but\n\n235\n00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,680\nwhat you have is you'll have that SID and\nwhat you do is you read, if you look at\n\n236\n00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,180\nthe whole thing, you look at the numbers\nto the right of the last dash.\n\n237\n00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:03,090\nThat's a critical thing to pay attention\nto because no matter what the system is,\n\n238\n00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,810\nwhat the accounts are named there's\ngonna be some standardization there.\n\n239\n00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,170\nIt used to be that people did little\nthings like rename the admin account and\n\n240\n00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,880\nguest account and stuff.\n\n241\n00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,770\nIt, really, for an ethical hacker.\n\n242\n00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,590\nFor someone that knows what they're doing.\n\n243\n00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,350\nThat's, that's barely a bump in the road.\n\n244\n00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,320\n>> Yeah.\n\n245\n00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,290\n>> Because you see no admin account or\nguest account on a system.\n\n246\n00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,430\nYou know they're supposed to be there.\n\n247\n00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,950\nI mean,\nthere's no way a Windows system exists.\n\n248\n00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,530\n>> Can't get rid of them.\n\n249\n00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,808\n>> Without having that, yeah.\n\n250\n00:13:32,808 --> 00:13:34,379\n>> You can disable them but\nyou can't get rid of them, yeah.\n\n251\n00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,430\n>> Yeah, you can disable it,\nbut you can't remove.\n\n252\n00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,808\nSo once you've, once you understand that,\nknow that they have to be there,\n\n253\n00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:47,630\nall you do at that point is just extract\nthe SIDs, and there's things that do that.\n\n254\n00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,590\nWe have a couple of utilities\ncalled SID to user and\n\n255\n00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,120\nuser to SID that are specifically\ndesigned to do that.\n\n256\n00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,899\nYou can target a user account that'll\nextract a SID off that user account.\n\n257\n00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,780\nYou look to the digits to\nthe right of the last dash.\n\n258\n00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,800\nIf it's a 500,\nit's an administrator account.\n\n259\n00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,590\nDoesn't matter what they call it, it's\nthe administrator account for that box.\n\n260\n00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,990\nIf the number, if the three digits after\nthat are a 501, that's a guest account.\n\n261\n00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,205\nAnd then anything that starts at 1000 and\ngoes over is a regular user account.\n\n262\n00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,020\n>> Right.\n\n263\n00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,390\n>> Now I'm not making any claim to say\nthat someone couldn't add one of those\n\n264\n00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,540\nother user accounts into\nthe administrators group to get that.\n\n265\n00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,042\n>> Good point.\n\n266\n00:14:26,042 --> 00:14:27,779\n>> They very well could have done that but\n\n267\n00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:31,500\nit will allow you to very clearly identify\nwhat the administrator account is.\n\n268\n00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> And the thing is,\n\n269\n00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,610\nwhat if someone does disable\nthe administrator account?\n\n270\n00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,210\nI can still find it.\n\n271\n00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,350\nI still found it.\n\n272\n00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,064\nI can, once I've gotten that level of\naccess, I've had people tell me that,\n\n273\n00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,639\nwell, what if you get that far and\n\n274\n00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:46,790\nsomeone's disabled\nthe administrator account?\n\n275\n00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,740\nWell, think about it.\n\n276\n00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,570\nDo you really think if I got\nthat far I can't re-enable it?\n\n277\n00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,840\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n278\n00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,980\n>> You know, they're not really thinking\ntoo much about it at that point.\n\n279\n00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,430\nSo, just something to kind of file away.\n\n280\n00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,342\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n281\n00:15:01,342 --> 00:15:05,670\nIt's like I haven't tested this on all\nthe operating, I know on Windows Vista,\n\n282\n00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,960\nfor example, it was one of the first\noperating systems that Microsoft\n\n283\n00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,950\ndisabled that administrator\naccount out of the box.\n\n284\n00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,170\nThe built in admin account was disabled.\n\n285\n00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,830\nThe first account you created was gonna\nbe your user account when added to\n\n286\n00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,080\nthe administrator's group and that's\nthe one again that had the relative ID,\n\n287\n00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,890\nthe last part of that SID was a 500,\nit was disabled.\n\n288\n00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,910\nBut you can go into safe mode,\nusing that disabled administrator account,\n\n289\n00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,060\nlog in, enable the administrator account,\nand then go into normal mode, and\n\n290\n00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,670\nget back in there.\n\n291\n00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,280\nSo, definitely ways around that.\n\n292\n00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,650\nFor sure.\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n293\n00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,040\nThere's always a way to get around stuff.\n\n294\n00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,410\n>> Yeah, so knowing those, the relative\nIDs for those built-in accounts,\n\n295\n00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,230\nas Sean said, when I create user\naccounts in Active Directory for\n\n296\n00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,050\nexample, we've got our RID master\nthat generates those RIDs and\n\n297\n00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,590\nthey start with a thousand and\nthey just increment it up.\n\n298\n00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,739\nAnd, I create Sean's account,\nI add him to the main admin's group and\n\n299\n00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:57,750\nhe's a domain admin.\n\n300\n00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,790\nBut, we've got the built in administrator\naccount that's in that domain\n\n301\n00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,250\nadmin's group, and\nthat's the one that has that relative ID,\n\n302\n00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,250\nthe last As you said, after that\nlast dash, that's going to be a 500.\n\n303\n00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,260\nSo you should do it.\n\n304\n00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,090\nIt's another layer of security.\n\n305\n00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,900\nIts gonna slow down your average\nhacker maybe or your script keys or\n\n306\n00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,520\nsomething like that.\n\n307\n00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,440\nI know a lot of the tools, Shawn,\nthat some of these script keys\n\n308\n00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,700\nare using are relying on that\nadministrator account being there and\n\n309\n00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,610\ncracking that password in the background.\n\n310\n00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,570\nSo, if you rename it,\nthat could break some of those tools but\n\n311\n00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,900\nthe good hacker,\nthe guy that really knows what he's doing,\n\n312\n00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,700\nyou're barely going to\nslow him down with that.\n\n313\n00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,230\n>> Yeah, it's barely a bump in the road\nfor someone that's experienced.\n\n314\n00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,985\nAnd also, you mentioned stuff It's like\nthe RID and RA Master and all that.\n\n315\n00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:49,455\nYeah, if you don't have\nfamiliarity with active directory,\n\n316\n00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:54,575\nITPro, I guess, does have those courses\nup there as well as active directory's.\n\n317\n00:16:54,575 --> 00:16:59,335\nNow would be a good time, at some point,\nto take a look at those active directory\n\n318\n00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:05,010\ncourses and get familiar with it,\nbecause if you don't have that knowledge,\n\n319\n00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:08,610\nyou're gonna need it because it is\ngonna be in stuff that you pen test.\n\n320\n00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,300\nYou can't avoid it.\n\n321\n00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,770\n>> Yep, yep, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n322\n00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,248\nAll right, so\nwe know we wanna escalate, and\n\n323\n00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:16,989\nwe could find that account\nthat we're looking for\n\n324\n00:17:16,989 --> 00:17:21,640\nthat already has the credentials,\nwe can increase the account that we have.\n\n325\n00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,620\nMaybe we're doing group memberships, maybe\nwe can figure out a way to modify some\n\n326\n00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,210\ngroup memberships to increase the level\nof access that that particular count has.\n\n327\n00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,460\nWhat else do we want to go over?\n\n328\n00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:32,960\nPrivilege?\n\n329\n00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,600\n>> Escalation?\n\n330\n00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,390\n>> Well,\nlet's talk about some other things,\n\n331\n00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,420\nsome other ways we can\nget privilege escalation.\n\n332\n00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:42,810\nOkay, well, the stuff that we just talked\nabout, with busting the Windows stuff?\n\n333\n00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:44,510\nThe set HC and all that?\n\n334\n00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,670\nThat's one way of doing it.\n\n335\n00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,980\nSome other ways you can\nget access to it is\n\n336\n00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,590\nthere's something called\nthe Trinity Rescue Kit.\n\n337\n00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,565\nIf you Google that, I was going\nto bring the webpage up here but\n\n338\n00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:59,414\nit's a boring old webpage.\n\n339\n00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:01,640\nBut the distro is free.\n\n340\n00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,480\nYou can download this distro\nof Trinity Rescue Kit.\n\n341\n00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,060\nIt is a Linux distro.\n\n342\n00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,600\nIt's a very small Linux distro.\n\n343\n00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,290\nIt will fit on a flash drive and\nI'm talking even an old flash drive that's\n\n344\n00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,490\nonly a few hundred megs, and\nI think it's only about 100 megs.\n\n345\n00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:21,200\nSo you can put that on a flash drive or\nwhat have you and just boot off of it.\n\n346\n00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,410\nAnd what will happen is it allows you to,\nit will scan the system and\n\n347\n00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,065\nlook for Windows installations.\n\n348\n00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:30,900\nLet you choose a Windows installation,\nif there's more than one and\n\n349\n00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,440\nyou can actually use it to scan what\nuser accounts are on that local box.\n\n350\n00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,460\nAnd it will allow you to reset the\npassword for an account that you choose.\n\n351\n00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,000\nOnce that's done all you have\nto do is reboot the system and\n\n352\n00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,970\nlog in to that account with the password\nthat you reset and you're done.\n\n353\n00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,390\n>> Like the old pop disks we use\nto use back in the floppy days.\n\n354\n00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:57,140\n>> Yeah, exactly, that's where it would\ncome in is stuff in that area code.\n\n355\n00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,930\n>> They also have tools like ERD Commander\nis one that's been around for\n\n356\n00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,940\na while, and it kind of does the same\nthing that Trinity Rescue Kit does,\n\n357\n00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,000\nplus a few other things.\n\n358\n00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,980\nYeah, the KO I said Trinity Rescue Kit.\n\n359\n00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,670\nIt's just Trinity.\n\n360\n00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:14,952\n>> URL there.\n\n361\n00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:21,880\n>> So that kit actually\n\n362\n00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:26,710\ndoes a number of things, so you might\nwanna check it out for other IT reasons.\n\n363\n00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,900\nAnd you can probably find some other\nreally good reasons at this point to\n\n364\n00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,350\nuse it for security reasons.\n\n365\n00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,460\nBut it is good for what we're\ndoing here to prove as escalation.\n\n366\n00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:42,490\nJust to boot off of it, find the account\nand reset the password on it and get in.\n\n367\n00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,720\nBut you have to have physical access and\n\n368\n00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,540\nthe ability to get into that system and\ndo that.\n\n369\n00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,470\nAnd it's probably going to be best\nto use on desktop systems, and\n\n370\n00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,770\nit would be a server.\n\n371\n00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:59,460\nServers, we'd have to find other ways\nof targeting for numerous reasons.\n\n372\n00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,050\nOn a server, if you rebooted\nto do something like a TRK,\n\n373\n00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,040\nthey're probably gonna pick that up\nbecause they're gonna be looking for\n\n374\n00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,990\nunscheduled reboots and stuff like that.\n\n375\n00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,820\nThe other thing on it is that when you\ntalk about something like a domain\n\n376\n00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,480\ncontroller.\n\n377\n00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,280\nIf you were gonna target one of those.\n\n378\n00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,870\nA domain controller really doesn't\nhave a local account on it.\n\n379\n00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,715\nIt has one.\n\n380\n00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:25,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n381\n00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:25,972\n>> But that's it.\n\n382\n00:20:25,972 --> 00:20:29,710\n>> Right, the good old directory service\nrestore mode password that we set.\n\n383\n00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,400\nBut.\n>> Yeah.\n\n384\n00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,710\n>> And servers, most of them,\n\n385\n00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,500\nat least with Windows servers, you can't\nremove the system without logging on first\n\n386\n00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,740\ncuz you have permissions\nto reboot that server.\n\n387\n00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,130\nClients from the logon screen,\nyou can reboot it.\n\n388\n00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,360\nSo it's a little bit easier\nto boot to an alternate OS or\n\n389\n00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,450\nsome type of external thumb drive,\nsomething like that servers.\n\n390\n00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,310\nUnless I'm gonna hard reboot, right,\nunplug it or something like that, and\n\n391\n00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,650\nthen you said,\nthat better set off some alarms.\n\n392\n00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,820\nOn somebody's network if a server just up\nand reboots in the middle of the day, or\n\n393\n00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,170\nsomething like that.\n\n394\n00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,500\n>> And the reality is it's going to be\nvery tough to get physical access to\n\n395\n00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,160\na domain control, or it should be.\n\n396\n00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:03,840\n>> Should be.\n[LAUGH]\n\n397\n00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,600\n>> I'm not going to say\n\n398\n00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,076\nits never going to happen\n>> It's under Bob's desk over there\n\n399\n00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:07,620\nin cubicle 4.\n\n400\n00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,340\n>> How often have you seen that, right?\n\n401\n00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,080\n>> I've seen it [LAUGH]\n>> It's way too much.\n\n402\n00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,590\n>> I've seen servers closets in\nthe ladies room where the last\n\n403\n00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,220\nstall was actually the entryway\nto their server closet.\n\n404\n00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,710\nSo there are some interesting\nsetups out there [LAUGH].\n\n405\n00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,610\n>> Yeah, people think it's safe too,\nI love that.\n\n406\n00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,840\nLike, it's secure.\n\n407\n00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,260\nNo it isn't.\n\n408\n00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,160\nI've seen it all, too, and it just.\n\n409\n00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,060\nMike's mentioning on here,\nmaybe we didn't make it clear.\n\n410\n00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,600\nHe said, Trinity Rescue Kit only\nworks on local, not domain accounts.\n\n411\n00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,530\nYeah, you're right.\n\n412\n00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,000\nIt only works on local accounts.\n\n413\n00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,290\nWe're not making any claim that it\nworks on domain level accounts.\n\n414\n00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,450\nIt's not designed for that.\n\n415\n00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,260\n>> Correct.\nYou know,\n\n416\n00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,390\nwhat we're doing is we're\naccessing that local system, and\n\n417\n00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,590\nthe only accounts that are stored on that\nlocal system is the SAM account manager,\n\n418\n00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:56,390\nor I'm sorry, the security\naccount manager or the SAM file.\n\n419\n00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,000\nThe domain accounts are out in active\ndirectory on the domain controller.\n\n420\n00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,350\nSo we're not going to be able reset\nanything from there like that.\n\n421\n00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,790\nSo yes, they are going to be\nworking with those local accounts.\n\n422\n00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,680\nBut that's a good start, right?\n\n423\n00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,430\nThat's a stepping stone in our way\nto escalate our privileges and\n\n424\n00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,730\nescalate our levels of access.\n\n425\n00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,350\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n426\n00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,260\n>> All right.\nSo we got the Trinity Rescue Kit that\n\n427\n00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,080\nwe might be able to use to try to\n\n428\n00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,380\nreset a password of a local account with\nsome other things we could take a look at.\n\n429\n00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,850\n>> There's actually a whole\nhost of tools that'll do this.\n\n430\n00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,500\nThere's another called\nWindows Pass Recovery that does it.\n\n431\n00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:34,510\nThere's other variations on the TRK theme.\n\n432\n00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,420\nThere's just a lot of different tools and\ntechniques for\n\n433\n00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,660\nbeing able to pull off\nprivilege escalation.\n\n434\n00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,760\nBut no matter what you\ndo the goal is the same,\n\n435\n00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,020\nto get more privileges than you\nwould otherwise be allowed to.\n\n436\n00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,440\nI mean, I even know of one utility that,\nit's getting a little tougher to find.\n\n437\n00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,630\nBut there's a utility from ages\nago called x.exe, and all you\n\n438\n00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:02,380\ngotta do is get it onto a system, it'd run\npretty much under anybody's privileges.\n\n439\n00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,930\nAs long as they're allowed to execute\nanything at all, they could run this file.\n\n440\n00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,670\nSo all you do is get it to the system,\nyou double-click on it,\n\n441\n00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,610\nit would make a account on\nthe system called x with a,\n\n442\n00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,280\njust a password of like 1 2 3 4 or\nsomething like that.\n\n443\n00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,140\nAnd it wouldn't show up on any lists.\n\n444\n00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,610\nAnd we're pretty much doing the same thing\nwe talked about with that sethe.exe,\n\n445\n00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:28,190\nit would do the same type of thing,\nbut before we had those,\n\n446\n00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,640\nit would install a local administrator\nlevel user account in that box and\n\n447\n00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,590\nit was pretty much impossible.\n\n448\n00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:37,740\nIt wasn't invisible, but\nit was nearly impossible to remove.\n\n449\n00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,847\n>> Yeah, that was a good one.\n\n450\n00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:40,590\n>> Special techniques\nto get it out of there.\n\n451\n00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,850\n>> That was definitely a good one.\n\n452\n00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,540\nA couple of questions that we'll\ngrab out of the chat room here.\n\n453\n00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,920\nOne, Fabian says, would it be a good idea\nafter gaining access to turn on Telnet?\n\n454\n00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,130\nWhat do you think about that?\n\n455\n00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,188\nI don't know if we would\n>> It's one of those things that I'm not\n\n456\n00:23:57,188 --> 00:24:02,290\ngoing to say it's a good idea,\nI'm not going to say it's a bad idea.\n\n457\n00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:08,120\nI'm going to say it depends on how you're\ntrying to run your next level of attacks.\n\n458\n00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,650\nAnd that's hard to say.\n\n459\n00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,510\nIt sounds like a wishy washy answer, but\n\n460\n00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,240\nthat's really it is, without knowing what\ntype, what you want to carry out for\n\n461\n00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,130\nyour next level attack, I can't say\nit's a good idea or a bad idea.\n\n462\n00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,060\nAnd so.\n>> Yeah.\n\n463\n00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,290\nI think enabling telanon in the system\nthat I've already gained access to\n\n464\n00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,450\nwould allow me to then use telnet to\ntry to connect to another machine.\n\n465\n00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,040\nIf that's your tool of choice\nthat you wanna use in your plan,\n\n466\n00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,430\nI don't that it's gonna make it any easier\nto connect to that machine later or\n\n467\n00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,030\nanything like that, so.\n\n468\n00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,620\nDepends on what you're\ntrying to accomplish.\n\n469\n00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,040\nAnother good question out of\nthe chat room that William has,\n\n470\n00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,760\nwhat about locally\ncashed domain passwords.\n\n471\n00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,460\nAs far as I know Shawn,\nthey're not cached in the SAM or\n\n472\n00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,170\nin the Security Account Manager, and I'm\nnot going to be gaining access to those\n\n473\n00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,100\npasswords through any of\nthe methods we've used here.\n\n474\n00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,710\n>> Yeah,\nthose passwords are protected a lot better\n\n475\n00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,230\n>> Then just are the passwords we're\n\n476\n00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,780\ntalking about.\n\n477\n00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,390\nIf memory serves they're not only\nstored separate from the SAM,\n\n478\n00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:15,830\nthey actually have a couple levels\nof encryption in place on them.\n\n479\n00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,400\nSo it's gonna make it a lot\ntougher to get those credentials.\n\n480\n00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,400\n>> Right, and I don't think like trying\nto modify those credentials would end up\n\n481\n00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,780\nmodifying the account in active directory,\nactually changing the passwords and\n\n482\n00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,440\nlike that.\n\n483\n00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,550\n>> Yeah, more than likely if you were\nable to get a cash credential and tried\n\n484\n00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,250\nto change anything or modified anything\n>> It's just gonna cause an account\n\n485\n00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,970\nnot to be able to be logged\nin from that system.\n\n486\n00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,210\nIt'll be recached next time someone\nwith valid credentials does log in.\n\n487\n00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:46,870\n>> Hopefully that answers\nyou guys questions.\n\n488\n00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,330\nIf not ask them again and\nwe'll try it again.\n\n489\n00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,010\nAll right.\nLet's see what else we need to go over.\n\n490\n00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,310\nWe talked about a couple of\nthe different tools we can use for\n\n491\n00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,660\nthis privilege escalation.\n\n492\n00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,920\n>> I guess we should talk\nabout if we want to try and\n\n493\n00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,580\nprotect it if we are the good guy,\nor we're doing our pen testing and\n\n494\n00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,640\nwe find out that they are vulnerable\nto this type of attack.\n\n495\n00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,469\nWhat might we suggest or\nwhat can we do to help protect against.\n\n496\n00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,220\n>> Yeah, so\nwe always have taught the defensive side.\n\n497\n00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,350\nGenerally to make recommendations to\nyour client as far as what should\n\n498\n00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,330\nthey do to prevent what you were\nsuccessful at, or at least attempting, and\n\n499\n00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:29,730\nin this case, probably your biggest\ndefense is using least privilege.\n\n500\n00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,710\nSo no account should have\nexcessive privileges on it.\n\n501\n00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:37,080\nThen you should have a situation where\nyou're using separation of duties,\n\n502\n00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,620\nwhere no account has too many privileges,\nor tasks assigned to it.\n\n503\n00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,650\nAny key account should not\nonly have better passwords but\n\n504\n00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:51,170\nshould be very locked\ndown to what they can do.\n\n505\n00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,310\nThere should be no.\n\n506\n00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:56,230\nLike to call God level accounts that can\ndo anything they want whenever they want.\n\n507\n00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,070\nThat should never exists.\n\n508\n00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,340\nThat is bad for a number of reasons.\n\n509\n00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,220\nA disgruntled employee\ncan ruin your whole day.\n\n510\n00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,220\nI can ruin your whole day as\na pen tester just by getting in.\n\n511\n00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,390\nAnd monkeying with that account,\nso you want to exercise that.\n\n512\n00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,700\nAnd then having good auditing,\nto check to see if anything like this,\n\n513\n00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,680\nif any weird stuff has happening,\nand not to mention you can\n\n514\n00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,070\neven do things like restricted groups and\nstuff like that in most operating systems.\n\n515\n00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,880\nWindows definitely does that.\n\n516\n00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,070\nYou can set up group policy.\n\n517\n00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:33,292\nYou can lock down groups through group\npolicy and even have group policy prune\n\n518\n00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:38,451\nthose groups if something does\nsuccessfully get added, it will remove it.\n\n519\n00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:43,247\nThere are steps which you can\ntake to make it a lot safer.\n\n520\n00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,429\n>> All right, good deal, good deal.\n\n521\n00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,143\n>> All right.\n\n522\n00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:51,083\nLooking at the clock is about time for\nus to take our break,\n\n523\n00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:53,309\nthat looks like a good spot there,\nI think.\n\n524\n00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:54,750\nSo, let's take our break now.\n\n525\n00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,940\nAnd when we come back, we'll continue on.\n\n526\n00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,730\nWe're gonna take a look at how we\nmight be able to run applications\n\n527\n00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:03,410\non a system that we have compromised.\n\n528\n00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:04,570\nSo stay tuned.\n\n529\n00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,090\nWe'll be right back.\n\n530\n00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:12,090\n[MUSIC]\n\n531\n00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,890\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentleman.\n\n532\n00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:16,965\nContinuing on with our\ngaining access chapter or\n\n533\n00:28:16,965 --> 00:28:19,670\ngaining access to a system chapter.\n\n534\n00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,360\nAt this point we are getting ready\nto talk about running applications.\n\n535\n00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,700\nSo Sean, when we think about running\napplications, what do we mean by that, and\n\n536\n00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,980\nwhat do we want to run?\n\n537\n00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,440\nYeah, that's the thing.\n\n538\n00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,950\nYou've gotten pretty far at this point\nwith gaining access to a system.\n\n539\n00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,490\nYou've cracked passwords.\n\n540\n00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,970\nYou've targeted a user account.\n\n541\n00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,040\nYou've escalated privileges.\n\n542\n00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,220\nYou should\n\n543\n00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,350\nhave at this point a good bubble of access\nwhere you can start executing things.\n\n544\n00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,660\nAnd the question is when you are executing\nthings to carry out processes.\n\n545\n00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,700\nWhat do you do,\n\n546\n00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,780\nthat is always the common thing that\nI get asked by students and others.\n\n547\n00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,720\nIn other words,\nonce you have the access now what?\n\n548\n00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,630\nWell you didn't get the access\njust to get the access you\n\n549\n00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,920\ngot the access to do something.\n\n550\n00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,220\nI always encourage you\nto be thinking ahead of\n\n551\n00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,600\nwhat it is you ultimately want to do.\n\n552\n00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,120\nHave multiple paths of things\nthat you would like to do, and\n\n553\n00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,190\nkind of prioritize, like, I wanna do\nthis one, but if I can't do this one,\n\n554\n00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,880\nI wanna do this one, and\nthis one, and this one.\n\n555\n00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,560\nAnd that way, when you're working,\nyou know what the goal is, and\n\n556\n00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,970\nyou're working towards it.\n\n557\n00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:34,260\nThings may change, but you kind of\ncan see where your path is going.\n\n558\n00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,190\nNow, we're assuming at this point,\nyou do want to run an application.\n\n559\n00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:39,640\nYou want to run a script,\nyou want to make a configuration change.\n\n560\n00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,230\nYou want to do something like that.\n\n561\n00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,180\nSo what you run is going to\nbe in line with those goals.\n\n562\n00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,630\nIf you want to install a key logger\non a system because you want to\n\n563\n00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,230\ncapture credentials.\n\n564\n00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,110\nAt that point, that's what you got to do.\n\n565\n00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,735\nYou got to go.\n\n566\n00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:55,995\nAnd find a keylogger,\n\n567\n00:29:55,995 --> 00:30:00,115\na software keylogger in this case, a\nhardware one's a totally different matter.\n\n568\n00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:04,715\nIf you're gonna install a software\nkeylogger, find the one's that you,\n\n569\n00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:08,750\nfind one that you like, one that you\nknow is gonna work in that situation and\n\n570\n00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,080\nhave a couple alternatives just in case,\nand slip it on to the system.\n\n571\n00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:17,740\nAnd make sure that it's functioning.\n\n572\n00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,300\nThen you back away and let it just\nsit there and do its dirty work.\n\n573\n00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,490\nIf you want to run scripts,\nnow's the time to do it.\n\n574\n00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:29,700\nYou wanna extract a SAM file off a system.\n\n575\n00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,730\nNow's the time to do it.\n\n576\n00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,600\nYou can also have where you've\npunched a hole in the system,\n\n577\n00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,260\nyou can even do things like\nthere's the ps tool suite,\n\n578\n00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,025\nI saw someone in the discussion\ngroups mention that.\n\n579\n00:30:43,025 --> 00:30:46,265\nIs that you can run the ps\ntools suite from Microsoft,\n\n580\n00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:47,855\nthat's their Sysinternals suite.\n\n581\n00:30:49,355 --> 00:30:50,805\nOr Winternals, whatever.\n\n582\n00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:51,880\nGo look for it, it's up there.\n\n583\n00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,985\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you can Google the ps tools suite,\n\n584\n00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:58,255\nand it's a free suite for Microsoft,\nand they have stuff that will\n\n585\n00:30:58,255 --> 00:31:02,965\nactually allow you to transfer files to a\nsystem, as well as execute them remotely.\n\n586\n00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:06,160\nAnd so now maybe once you've\nopened the system up,\n\n587\n00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,290\nyou want to place files in the system.\n\n588\n00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,380\nSo now you can use something like ps\ntool to place stuff on the system\n\n589\n00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:17,250\nfor later use, whatever that might be.\n\n590\n00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,480\nSo you've got a lot of neat\nstuff you can actually do.\n\n591\n00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,160\nYou may even go in there to\nextract stuff off office system,\n\n592\n00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760\nthat is definitely done.\n\n593\n00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,690\nSo, what you wanna do, and what you're\ngonna try to run really all depends,\n\n594\n00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:38,720\nbut be thinking ahead of what\nit is you wanna accomplish.\n\n595\n00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,300\n>> So like our other phases,\nthen, we still have our\n\n596\n00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,330\nexpectations part of it and\nour goal part of it that we should've set.\n\n597\n00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:48,930\nBefore this.\n\n598\n00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:51,537\nSo when we get in there and\nwe're escalating our privileges,\n\n599\n00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:54,960\nwe have something in mind, that we're\ntrying, we're doing this for a reason.\n\n600\n00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,300\nSo we need our expectations and\nwe need our goals.\n\n601\n00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,270\n>> Yeah, and remember, unlike our previous\nsets of goals, Our previous sets of goals\n\n602\n00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,390\nwere, hey here's our core goals and here's\noptional goals that I would like to have.\n\n603\n00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,250\nHere's the things I want to accomplish\n,and anything once I accomplish those,\n\n604\n00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:15,180\nanything that grows out beyond that,\nit Is icing on the cake.\n\n605\n00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,770\nIt's going to.\n\n606\n00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,000\nIn here it's a little different.\n\n607\n00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,130\nYou could have those things that are core\nthings you want to accomplish, and\n\n608\n00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,130\nthen you have the icing on the cake.\n\n609\n00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,470\nBut be prepared.\n\n610\n00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:31,070\nYou may get this far, and the attack\nthat you would like to pull off,\n\n611\n00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,600\nYou just can't get that level access,\nor that\n\n612\n00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,130\nlevel of control that you need ,or set\nthe environment up to be able to do that.\n\n613\n00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,400\nSo you may need to change plans.\n\n614\n00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,720\nThey say that Murphy's Law type thing.\n\n615\n00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,595\nNothing ever goes as expected or planned.\n\n616\n00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:50,050\nThat,'s kind of what we're looking at,\nis that you have to plan ahead and say,\n\n617\n00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,810\nwell, if things don't go as planned\ndo you have an alternative method?\n\n618\n00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,060\nAnd be absolutely prepared for that.\n\n619\n00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,530\nNow, I'm not going to sit here and\nbrainstorm every potential scenario.\n\n620\n00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,990\nYou're going to have\nto think on your feet.\n\n621\n00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:08,050\nPart of being a pin\ntester is the fact that,\n\n622\n00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,510\ncurveballs will be thrown at you have\nto be able to think on your feet.\n\n623\n00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,370\nSo have some ideas of some things\nyou might like to pull off, and\n\n624\n00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,701\nprioritize them appropriately.\n\n625\n00:33:17,701 --> 00:33:20,730\nBut then, also be prepared that\nnone of those may fit, and\n\n626\n00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,830\nyou need to think of\nother things you can do.\n\n627\n00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,510\n>> All right.\n\n628\n00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,810\nSo be flexible.\n\n629\n00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:30,910\nBe able to change and\nmodify your goals on the fly.\n\n630\n00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,098\nThat's those, what do we call them?\n\n631\n00:33:32,098 --> 00:33:35,820\nThe intangibles of what makes\na good certified ethical hacker,\n\n632\n00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,500\nis being able to come up with a plan B,\nhave a plan B, have a plan C already.\n\n633\n00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,590\nAnd maybe you can be able to switch\nto a plan D if it warrants it.\n\n634\n00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,000\nSo come up with something on the fly.\n\n635\n00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,100\nAll right so, what kinds of things\nthat we thinking about running,\n\n636\n00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,600\nis some of the things\nthat pop into my mind,\n\n637\n00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,750\nare gonna be things like you\nmentioned keystroke loggers.\n\n638\n00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:56,930\nMaybe scanning tools and things like that.\n\n639\n00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,790\nLike actually going, you know, back and\n\n640\n00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,030\nnow that I'm inside, my scanning\nresults might be a little different.\n\n641\n00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,130\nI might be able to gain\nmore information from that.\n\n642\n00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:10,180\nYou know, I could capture utilities,\nstart to capture other credentials,\n\n643\n00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,420\nwhich might be easier now\nthat I'm on the inside.\n\n644\n00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,660\nYeah, you've punched it.\n\n645\n00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,700\nBut you've punched a hole in the system.\n\n646\n00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,490\nSo now you get to decide,\nwhat it is you want to do.\n\n647\n00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,300\nA script might be a good thing.\n\n648\n00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,970\nYou know, how about this,\nyou run a script that\n\n649\n00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:29,100\nruns the different things like ping and\ntraceroute and stuff like that.\n\n650\n00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,800\nRuns those things and\nwrites those results to a file.\n\n651\n00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,290\nNow all you have to do is get something\nto transfer that file off the system, and\n\n652\n00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,490\nyou're good.\n\n653\n00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,060\nSo maybe mapping out the network from\nthe inside would be a good thing.\n\n654\n00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,220\nQuerying DNS, some of the stuff we\nsaw back in our numeration phase,\n\n655\n00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:50,010\nand and\nour scanning of foot printing phase.\n\n656\n00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,570\nYou might be going back and\nrevisiting that, and\n\n657\n00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,420\ntrying to get at,\nnow that you're on the inside of the wall.\n\n658\n00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:58,840\nBecause the results may vary.\n\n659\n00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:03,700\nMore than likely, what's going to\nhappen is, they won't just vary, it's\n\n660\n00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,530\na case of that, you're going to get access\nto a whole new level of information.\n\n661\n00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,850\nAnd you're gonna take that, and\nline up with what you currently have.\n\n662\n00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,830\nIt might verify or\ninvalidate some of the stuff, or\n\n663\n00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:19,480\nyou may have to figure out which\none's correct and which one's not.\n\n664\n00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,190\nBut you're gonna get that information and\nsee what you have.\n\n665\n00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,730\n>> Exactly.\n\n666\n00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,600\nWe talked about it in a previous\nepisode about like Split DNS.\n\n667\n00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,740\nAnd from the outside we saw there\nare publicly available DNS records and\n\n668\n00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,140\nwe're able to get that stuff.\n\n669\n00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,170\nNow I'm on the inside, now I've got that\nother part of DNS, right, the one that\n\n670\n00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,440\nknows about all their machines, all\ntheir SRV records and things like that.\n\n671\n00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,891\nSo that opens up a whole new set\nof information that I can capture.\n\n672\n00:35:44,891 --> 00:35:46,070\n>> Absolutely.\n\n673\n00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,810\n>> And I like one of the comments in the\nchat room, first thing, map the network.\n\n674\n00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,119\nAbsolutely while I'm inside there.\n\n675\n00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:52,880\nYeah.\n\n676\n00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,230\nDo what's appropriate, at that point.\n\n677\n00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,750\nMap the Network App may\nnot be a bad idea to do.\n\n678\n00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,940\nLike I said, remember it's very easy\nto run the script, and just bang,\n\n679\n00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:10,900\nbang, bang, run many of the core\ntroubleshooting and diagnostic tools\n\n680\n00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,730\nthat are in that operating system, and\nget them to get that information for you.\n\n681\n00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,320\nAnd you'll be in good shape at that point.\n\n682\n00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,500\nI mean heck,\nyou may even implant stuff on the system.\n\n683\n00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,740\nThere's things called rats.\n\n684\n00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:32,150\nRemote administrative tools, or reverse\naccess trojans, they also call them.\n\n685\n00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,880\nOr remote access trojans, rather.\n\n686\n00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,410\nYou can open one of those, or\nput one of those on a system.\n\n687\n00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,260\nThat can open a whole,\npunch a hole out of the network.\n\n688\n00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,740\nAt which point,\nnow you can start contacting it.\n\n689\n00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,550\nSo, there's some neat stuff you can do.\n\n690\n00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,450\nOn top of this, there's things\nlike Malware that you could run,\n\n691\n00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,870\nthat's gonna plant on\na system at this point.\n\n692\n00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,950\nWe're not gonna go into Malware today,\nbut that's something that\n\n693\n00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,850\nyou could conceivably do, is create your\nown malworm and plant that on the system.\n\n694\n00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,180\nBefore you go doing that, or\n\n695\n00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,300\neven attempting that, there's some words\nof cautions that we should talk about,\n\n696\n00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,510\nand we're gonna talk about\nthat in another section.\n\n697\n00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,870\nBut I'm just saying right now,\nopening the door to being able to do that.\n\n698\n00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,360\nThat you could be doing some\npretty neat stuff at this point.\n\n699\n00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,670\n>> Planting those seeds for you guys.\n\n700\n00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:25,860\nGiving you some food for\nthought that we will expand upon later.\n\n701\n00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,530\nAlright, so we get an idea\nthen of what we want to run.\n\n702\n00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,920\nOnce we gain access to that system,\nwhat kind of thing,\n\n703\n00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,310\nor how we go about running\nthese applications.\n\n704\n00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:39,060\n>> How do you go about\nrunning these applications?\n\n705\n00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:42,343\nAgain, there's a lot of\nthings on the buffet here.\n\n706\n00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:46,930\nYou could, if you have the right\nlevel of access, it may just be\n\n707\n00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:52,020\na case of Saying run this program,\ntype it in, you might be simple as that.\n\n708\n00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,800\nBut if you're going to do\nsomething more complex,\n\n709\n00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,220\nthere's things like, there's one utility\nI know of called the remote executor.\n\n710\n00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:06,400\nThat's designed to do just that,\nthere's a utilities that in the PS tools,\n\n711\n00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,160\nthere's a PS exec that will\nallow you to run stuff remotely.\n\n712\n00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,640\nSo those are things that\nmay help you run stuff\n\n713\n00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,380\nremotely on a system once\nyou implant it there.\n\n714\n00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,680\n>> Nice.\nNice.\n\n715\n00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,990\nAll right.\nAbsolutely.\n\n716\n00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,780\nWe think about what it is we wanna run, we\nget it in there, we figured out how we're\n\n717\n00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,570\ngonna run it, whether that's just\nrun it like a normal application.\n\n718\n00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,810\nOr use some other application that\nmight help us get those applications,\n\n719\n00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,060\nfeel like I used the word application\ntoo many times in there but.\n\n720\n00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,245\n[LAUGH] You know, having something that\ncan assist us to run those applications.\n\n721\n00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:43,770\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right?\n\n722\n00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,630\nWhere's my thesaurus.\n\n723\n00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,097\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] It's probably\nout there in the chat room,\n\n724\n00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:48,993\nI need my thesaurus.\n\n725\n00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:49,881\nWe'll get one for Monday.\n\n726\n00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:54,660\n[LAUGH] So\nwe figure out what it is we want to run.\n\n727\n00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,050\nWhat programs, applications,\nhow we're going to get those executed.\n\n728\n00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,050\nActivity monitors,\nI think comes up in here.\n\n729\n00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,030\nThat's another good choice that\nyou can take off the menu.\n\n730\n00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:13,450\nYes, you can map the network,\nI'm not trying to say that, don't do that.\n\n731\n00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,990\nThat's not a bad choice.\n\n732\n00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,980\nI wouldn't sit here and say,\nwhat are you doing by doing that.\n\n733\n00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,740\nThat's not a bad choice.\n\n734\n00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,740\nAnother choice,\n\n735\n00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:26,280\nyou could add in is, put one of those\nactivity monitors on the system.\n\n736\n00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,440\nAnd we have so many of these,\n\n737\n00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,640\nit's actually pretty crazy\nthe amount that you have.\n\n738\n00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,980\nYou have activity monitors\nthat are designed to do just\n\n739\n00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,510\nJust a little more than\nstandard key logging.\n\n740\n00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,273\nYou have ones that will\nmonitor web browsing, and\n\n741\n00:39:42,273 --> 00:39:44,880\nyou have ones even far above that.\n\n742\n00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,640\nThere's ones that can have\ntons of bells and whistles,\n\n743\n00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,400\nthat anything you want that\nhappens on that system, and\n\n744\n00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,290\nkeep extensive logs and actually send\nthem out to you on a regular basis.\n\n745\n00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:03,050\nOne of the ones I think of, just show you\nsome of the specialized ones we have.\n\n746\n00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,599\nThere's one they reference in my book\ncalled the printer activity monitor\n\n747\n00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:08,810\nor PAM.\n\n748\n00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:12,480\nThat one, if you can do a privilege\nescalation successfully and\n\n749\n00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,480\nopen that hole in the system,\nyou run this and\n\n750\n00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,110\nwhat will happen is you can plug into\nprint cues all over the network.\n\n751\n00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,580\nAnd what it will do is once it plugs into\nthose print queues, you can get it to\n\n752\n00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:26,440\nemail you copies of every print\njob that goes to that print queue.\n\n753\n00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,600\nAnd so it won't impact that\nprint queue in any way.\n\n754\n00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,900\nSo when the person prints something,\nthey can walk over and\n\n755\n00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,030\ngo get that hard copy of that.\n\n756\n00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:40,130\nBut at the same time they're getting\na hard copy when they print something out,\n\n757\n00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:44,100\nyou're also getting a copy sent to you\nthat you can easily go ahead and read.\n\n758\n00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,260\nAnd on top of that,\nthat utility can not only,\n\n759\n00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,990\nwill send you copies of print job,\nit can tell you usage on printers.\n\n760\n00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,450\nIt can tell you who's printing what and\nhow many pages.\n\n761\n00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:58,950\nI mean, it's designed to be\nan administrative tool and\n\n762\n00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:02,960\nlisten in on queues and monitor them\nfrom an enterprise standpoint, but\n\n763\n00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,950\nwe're just repurposing it to get copies.\n\n764\n00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,660\nI mean how valuable is that, right?\n\n765\n00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,240\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n766\n00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,530\n>> Why am I getting copies\nof your guys' print jobs?\n\n767\n00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,520\nI mean I love it.\n\n768\n00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,800\n>> I mean think about all the things that\nare being printed on your network, right?\n\n769\n00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,660\nSome people are printing out maybe some\ninvitations to their kids birthday party,\n\n770\n00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,920\nbut hopefully not.\n\n771\n00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,630\nBut HR's printing things, people,\nsales quotes, figures, things like that.\n\n772\n00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:25,650\nThat's kind of some scary stuff,\ngrabbing all that.\n\n773\n00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,010\n'Cause they might have that network secure\nwhere only certain people can print\n\n774\n00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,890\nto certain printers, but\n\n775\n00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,230\nif I'm intercepting at the queue level,\nthen I'm gonna have access to all of that.\n\n776\n00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,680\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n777\n00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,840\nSo, that is just one level of monitoring.\n\n778\n00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,960\nLike I said, you can use a spyware type\n\n779\n00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,500\napplication to monitor\nwhere they are browsing to.\n\n780\n00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,440\nYou could monitor what\napplications they're using.\n\n781\n00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,360\nYou can monitor instant messaging stuff.\n\n782\n00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,090\nI've seen the whole length.\n\n783\n00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:08,360\nThere's an unbelievable amount of\nutilities designed to monitor activity.\n\n784\n00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,507\nThey even have ones that are specifically\ndesign to monitor employees that employers\n\n785\n00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:15,940\ncan deploy onto a system to see\nwhat their employees are doing.\n\n786\n00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,060\nWe can actually grab those things and\nuse them against these people.\n\n787\n00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:24,420\nI mean, heck, maybe you can do a pan\ntest if a company already has that in\n\n788\n00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,970\nplace in which case you open\nthe hole in the system.\n\n789\n00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:30,140\nYou go in and grab the file and\nlook at it yourself.\n\n790\n00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,484\nThey've already collected it for you.\n\n791\n00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:33,421\n>> [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n792\n00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:36,980\n>> I have heard of that sort of thing.\n\n793\n00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,330\n>> Does it get any better than that?\n\n794\n00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,390\nSomebody doing my work for\nme and my getting paid?\n\n795\n00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,100\n>> Absolutely.\n\n796\n00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,835\n>> I like it.\n\n797\n00:42:41,835 --> 00:42:44,049\n[LAUGH]\n>> Let them do the dirty work.\n\n798\n00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:51,930\nLet them do the work and I'll grab it,\nand let me add another level onto this.\n\n799\n00:42:51,930 --> 00:42:56,625\nAnother level you can add on to this whole\nthing is that in a Windows platform,\n\n800\n00:42:56,625 --> 00:43:01,240\nthere's something called,\nwhat is it the child activity monitor?\n\n801\n00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,850\n>> The parental controls\n>> The parental controls, yeah,\n\n802\n00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,690\nthat we have in there.\n\n803\n00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,930\nWhat those ones do is,\nthose ones were designed for\n\n804\n00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,700\nparents to monitor what\ntheir kids are doing.\n\n805\n00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:19,520\nBut just in case you haven't\nbeen into that software,\n\n806\n00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,000\nit actually has all the stuff\nI was talking about.\n\n807\n00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,280\nIt's got stuff to monitor\ninstant messaging,\n\n808\n00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,790\nemails, where they're browsing to.\n\n809\n00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,510\n>> All their browser history.\n\n810\n00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,260\n>> Applications, everything, it can do all\nthat stuff and tell you when and where,\n\n811\n00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,850\nit's got fully detailed reports.\n\n812\n00:43:37,685 --> 00:43:38,860\nThat's a gold mine for me.\n\n813\n00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,775\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n814\n00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:40,285\n>> Now,\n\n815\n00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:44,625\nthe thing is if you go into the domain\nit typically de-activates those tools.\n\n816\n00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:49,175\nBut if someone knows what they\nare doing it only takes a simple\n\n817\n00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:52,965\nseries of steps to re-enable\nit even on a domain.\n\n818\n00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:58,845\nAnd face it, think about\nthe employees you work with and\n\n819\n00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,880\nthe average Joe using a system.\n\n820\n00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:04,280\nThey're gonna go through and start\npoking at the start menu, most people,\n\n821\n00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,180\nyou know as well as I do, most people\nonly go to a few things on their menu.\n\n822\n00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,880\nThey never look at the whole thing.\n\n823\n00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,090\nIf you told somebody, hey, there's\na system tools on there, they're like, oh,\n\n824\n00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,680\nyeah, there is, isn't there?\n\n825\n00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,100\nThey don't go there.\n\n826\n00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,690\nIf they did,\nwe wouldn't need to put a task in there,\n\n827\n00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,285\nautomatically defragment their drive.\n\n828\n00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:23,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n829\n00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:26,050\nthey'd see it and hopefully do it.\n\n830\n00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,270\nSo they don't go to these things.\n\n831\n00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,590\nThey only go to a few things, and after\nyou've clicked them off the start menu\n\n832\n00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:36,420\na couple times they're going to be\nin your shortcut list right there.\n\n833\n00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,960\nAnd that's the only\nplace people will visit.\n\n834\n00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,360\nThey'll never even expand\nthe start menu anymore.\n\n835\n00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,538\nHeck, it may be a shortcut\non their desktop they use.\n\n836\n00:44:42,538 --> 00:44:43,106\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n\n837\n00:44:43,106 --> 00:44:44,880\n[LAUGH]\n>> They may not even know there's\n\n838\n00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,470\nOffice links on their start menu.\n\n839\n00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,170\nThey may double-click on a file and\nstart it up from that.\n\n840\n00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,280\nBut the point being that I could turn\non parental controls, have them pop\n\n841\n00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,870\nup on your start menu cuz Windows installs\nthem, and no one will even notice.\n\n842\n00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,790\n>> No one will even notice.\n\n843\n00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:01,770\n>> If someone does notice,\n\n844\n00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,690\nthey're just gonna say\n>> That must be some more of the crap that\n\n845\n00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,880\nMicrosoft installs in Windows by default.\n\n846\n00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:09,700\n>> Exactly, and\nI'm just going to ignore it.\n\n847\n00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,020\nWell hell, even Microsoft took our\nstart menu away for a little while.\n\n848\n00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,335\nThat's how much we use it right?\n\n849\n00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah and that's where the nastiness\n\n850\n00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:22,800\ncomes in is the interface is changing,\nWindows 10's gonna change it.\n\n851\n00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,410\nYet again it's taken another form so\nit's gonna shake things up again.\n\n852\n00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:32,170\nSo people are uncomfortable with menus,\nthey've been rearranged so they don't know\n\n853\n00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,919\nwhat to expect, what not to expect,\nsomething new showing up on there.\n\n854\n00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,310\nIsn't gonna attract any attention.\n\n855\n00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:43,350\nThey'll go, oh look I'm a little kid now,\nthere's parental activity thing on here,\n\n856\n00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:46,820\nparental controls on here.\n\n857\n00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:50,100\nSo, it's just something to think about.\n\n858\n00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,260\nIt would be different, though,\nif you tried to install something like\n\n859\n00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,950\nNet Nanny or something like that,\none of those monitoring software.\n\n860\n00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,780\nThat's a dead giveaway.\n\n861\n00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:01,563\nThe Microsoft stuff-\n>> Who knows with Microsoft.\n\n862\n00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:04,910\nIt could have been an update that\nadded it to my start menu, or\n\n863\n00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,813\nsomething they're trying to push or\nwhat have you.\n\n864\n00:46:07,813 --> 00:46:11,301\nMost people are not going to really\ncare if it pops up a new icon on their\n\n865\n00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:11,980\nstart menu.\n\n866\n00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,020\n>> Yeah,\npeople are very much creatures of habit.\n\n867\n00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,188\nThey're gonna use the same\nthings all the time.\n\n868\n00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:20,460\nIf they see something pop up in\nWindows that wasn't there before, or\n\n869\n00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:26,110\nit's something that they don't use,\nthey're just gonna be, okay, whatever.\n\n870\n00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:28,490\nI'm gonna go about my business.\n\n871\n00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:30,330\nThat's pretty much it.\n\n872\n00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,440\nMeanwhile, I've installed it and I'm gonna\nwait for the thing to start logging things\n\n873\n00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:39,320\nand grab all that, and\nI'll come back later and do whatever.\n\n874\n00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:43,820\nRemember part of this gaining access is\nmaking sure you've also set up a way to\n\n875\n00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,200\ncome back later.\n\n876\n00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,800\nWe've already seen here a couple\ntimes about installing Telnet and\n\n877\n00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,950\nstuff like that.\n\n878\n00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:58,170\nI'm not gonna say turning those things on\nor enabling those things Is a bad idea.\n\n879\n00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,770\nJust figure out how you're gonna come back\nlater on cause you may not want to repeat\n\n880\n00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,240\nthese same steps.\n\n881\n00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:10,160\nIf you do the same thing and you do it too\nmany times someone's gonna pick it up.\n\n882\n00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:10,920\n>> Right.\n\n883\n00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,050\n>> I remember hearing the kind of same\nphilosophy when they taught us security\n\n884\n00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:17,580\nguys and\nguards in some of the casinos in Vegas.\n\n885\n00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:23,970\nThey say, if you were able to successfully\nget away with cheating a game, like\n\n886\n00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:28,310\na poker game or blackjack or something in\nVegas, if you got away with it and left\n\n887\n00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:31,910\nthe casino, they said, if you don't come\nback, we're probably not gonna find you.\n\n888\n00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:33,890\nThey said, but most people don't do that.\n\n889\n00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:38,210\nThey get successful once, and they get\ngreedier and greedier and greedier.\n\n890\n00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,090\nThey're like, oh look I did it,\nmore money or whatever.\n\n891\n00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,650\nThat's what gets people,\n\n892\n00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:48,160\nso you have to exercise the same\nlevel of caution as a pen tester.\n\n893\n00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,651\nFind a way to maintain access, because\nyou may not be able to go through and\n\n894\n00:47:52,651 --> 00:47:55,920\ndo all this busting in, and\nthen go back and use that.\n\n895\n00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,090\nThat's where stuff like setting up,\nyou can install an FTP server.\n\n896\n00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,420\nSome people do that.\n\n897\n00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,800\nYou can install the SSH deal,\nyou can do that.\n\n898\n00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,980\nSo there's a lot of things you can do.\n\n899\n00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,440\nSomething else to kinda mention\non here is, I've got one here,\n\n900\n00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,420\nwe can show this on\noverhead really quickly.\n\n901\n00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,080\nThis is something that you know\nI've got if you have physical\n\n902\n00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,880\naccess it's just another category.\n\n903\n00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,668\nThis is a Dropbox.\n\n904\n00:48:26,668 --> 00:48:31,520\nI'm not gonna show the full features\nof this today, but this is a Dropbox.\n\n905\n00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,917\nWhat this is,\nis it's got it's own battery,\n\n906\n00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:38,110\nyou can turn the thing on,\nyou can see the lights popping up on it.\n\n907\n00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,990\nAnd so it's got it's own battery inside.\n\n908\n00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,030\nIt's got about 12 hours worth of battery\nlife, you know, somewhere around there,\n\n909\n00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:45,030\ndepending on what you turn on.\n\n910\n00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:47,240\nIt's got the ability to do wireless.\n\n911\n00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:52,120\nI can flip the switch over here, and\nit can do just basic wireless, or\n\n912\n00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:57,440\nit can even go full 3G if I plkug in, or\n4G even if I plug in the dongle over here,\n\n913\n00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,660\nand then I can even plug in\na cable onto your network.\n\n914\n00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:05,010\nHow I would use this is if I was able\nto get physical access to a system or\n\n915\n00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,620\nthis is, this would be another great way.\n\n916\n00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:10,620\nYou get physical access to a server or\nto a system someplace.\n\n917\n00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,730\nI just take this thing, fully charged and\nset up of course, take the thing,\n\n918\n00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:18,290\nplug the cable in, and\njust pop it up someplace.\n\n919\n00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:22,700\nAnd it will sit there and since it's got\nabout 12 hours of battery life, this thing\n\n920\n00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:28,480\nwill open up a reverse SSH tunnel, or\nit will open itself up as a wi-fi hotspot.\n\n921\n00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,190\nIf I want, or with that adapter I\ncan just have it automatically dial\n\n922\n00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,300\na phone number, and\nit will start sending me stuff.\n\n923\n00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,270\nAnd this thing is so efficient and so\n\n924\n00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,010\neffective at what it does,\nyou can take it, stick it up someplace.\n\n925\n00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:45,150\nI mean, you could put a piece of\ntwo-sided tape or something there and\n\n926\n00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,620\nstick it up someplace and plug a cable in.\n\n927\n00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:51,120\nBy the time I've hit the parking lot, this\nthing will be chattering away to me saying\n\n928\n00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:55,985\nits ready to go and it will go ahead and\ntake care of the stuff itself.\n\n929\n00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:57,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n930\n00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,430\n>> I mean, that's how quick and\nefficient it is.\n\n931\n00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,890\nThat's like James Bond type stuff, right?\n\n932\n00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:03,420\nPop it up.\n\n933\n00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,130\nWho's gonna see this?\n\n934\n00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,690\nIf you don't have a good idea of size,\n\n935\n00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:16,805\nhere's my cell phone,\nit's a Galaxy S4, no it's a GameBoy.\n\n936\n00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:19,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or is it?\n\n937\n00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,640\n>> Or is it?\n\n938\n00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:26,295\n>> Yeah, but that's my cell phone,\nand that's the drop box next to it.\n\n939\n00:50:26,295 --> 00:50:27,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n940\n00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,320\n>> It's, I don't know,\n\n941\n00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,300\na little less than a pack of cigarettes or\nabout the size of a deck of cards.\n\n942\n00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:33,750\nIt's not that big.\n\n943\n00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,590\n>> Definitely easy to slip that in\nsomewhere unnoticed and nobody's See,\n\n944\n00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,740\nthat's like those keystroke loggers.\n\n945\n00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,520\nWell, if you've got that,\n\n946\n00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,380\nwe've got a whole lot that we'll\ntalk about physical security.\n\n947\n00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,140\nThat pretty much trumps everything.\n\n948\n00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:48,460\nIf I've got access,\nthen there's not a lot you can do and\n\n949\n00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:51,185\nthat is gonna be easy to hide somewhere.\n\n950\n00:50:51,185 --> 00:50:53,345\n>> Yeah, that's been the same for\n\n951\n00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:58,532\nages is that if I can touch a box\nit belongs to me now, period.\n\n952\n00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:01,745\nSo there's, that's it.\n\n953\n00:51:01,745 --> 00:51:03,167\nThe software stuff's a little different.\n\n954\n00:51:03,167 --> 00:51:06,940\nAll right ladies and gentleman\nlooking at the clock it's about for\n\n955\n00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:07,950\nus to take another break.\n\n956\n00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:12,846\nWe've got a little more that we wanna talk\nabout when it comes to gaining access\n\n957\n00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:15,751\nto a system so\nstay tuned we'll be right back.\n\n958\n00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:21,918\n[MUSIC]\n\n959\n00:51:21,918 --> 00:51:24,440\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n960\n00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,190\nContinuing on with our\nGaining Access module, or chapter.\n\n961\n00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:32,640\nThe last thing we're gonna talk about\nis something called covering tracks.\n\n962\n00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,330\nI got a couple things we're gonna to talk\nabout here, starting with, I don't know.\n\n963\n00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:37,550\nWhere do you want to start\nwith covering tracks?\n\n964\n00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,565\n>> Well, this is\n>> Don't we need to talk about why?\n\n965\n00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:42,540\n>> Yeah, we need to talk about why.\n\n966\n00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:45,940\nNow, let me just kind of put it out there.\n\n967\n00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:52,630\nFirst of all we have gaining access to\na system, covering tracts is technically\n\n968\n00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,450\na separate phase but we'll just go\nahead and talk about that right here,\n\n969\n00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:02,100\nas it's part of the process as we talk\nabout ways we can mess with the system.\n\n970\n00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:08,940\nWe're gonna talk about what you can\ndo to kinda clean up after yourself.\n\n971\n00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,431\nAnd so, I guess asking me why\nyou wanna cover up tracks,\n\n972\n00:52:12,431 --> 00:52:16,010\nis it should be when you think about it,\nkind of obvious.\n\n973\n00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,195\nYou've done a lot of\nstuff on the system but\n\n974\n00:52:18,195 --> 00:52:22,520\nthe last thing you wanna do is have\nsomeone detect what you're doing.\n\n975\n00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,110\nYou just really don't.\n\n976\n00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,020\nIf they detect what you're doing\nthey're going to shut it down so\n\n977\n00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,400\nyou want to minimize that footprint.\n\n978\n00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,240\nNow hopefully along the way\nyou have been minimizing\n\n979\n00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,010\nwhat you've left behind just\nas a matter of due course.\n\n980\n00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:43,550\nThe less you mess around and do that\nbull in a china shop type thing going in\n\n981\n00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,610\nthe less you actually have to go\nthrough and clean up afterwards.\n\n982\n00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,990\nBut there is gonna be some stuff\nyou have to clean up afterwards.\n\n983\n00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:55,640\nWhat might you have to clean up and hide?\n\n984\n00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,880\nWell first of all,\nyour strike into the system.\n\n985\n00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,000\nYour first things you might want\nto look at is your log files.\n\n986\n00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,650\nYour log files are gonna carry evidence of\nyour attack so, what you're gonna do is,\n\n987\n00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:15,670\nyou can use things like audit poll that's\nbuilt into Windows, you can use audit poll\n\n988\n00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:20,110\nto pause the logging process, as well\nas do different things with log files.\n\n989\n00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:25,180\nYou can absolutely use that, but that does\nhave a problem with it, is that when you\n\n990\n00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:32,200\nuse audit poll to for example pause\na log file or pause the logging process.\n\n991\n00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:34,900\nThe longer you're actually\nmonkeying around with the system,\n\n992\n00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,980\nthe bigger of a gap you're leaving there,\nand someone's gonna see it.\n\n993\n00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:41,180\nThat mean that looks\nconspicuous by its absence.\n\n994\n00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,730\nIt will draw attention.\n\n995\n00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:46,020\n>> There's entries all the way up.\n\n996\n00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:49,100\nEvery few seconds you've got\nentries in this log file\n\n997\n00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,330\nall of a sudden there's an hour long gap,\nand then there's more entries.\n\n998\n00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,260\nKinda obvious that something\nhas gone mock in there.\n\n999\n00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,988\n>> Yeah,\nunless you happen to be a time lord.\n\n1000\n00:53:56,988 --> 00:53:59,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1001\n00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,580\nOh, my god.\n\n1002\n00:54:01,795 --> 00:54:07,750\n>> [LAUGH] We definitely wanna\nget in there and we could\n\n1003\n00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:13,060\nwipe the log files, but again, that's\nanother one that's a little obvious.\n\n1004\n00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,750\n>> Yeah, if you use audit poll to go\nthrough and manipulate the log files,\n\n1005\n00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:21,070\nwhat's gonna happen is,\nin newer Windows operating systems,\n\n1006\n00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:24,030\nit will actually log an event\nsaying it was purged.\n\n1007\n00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:24,940\n>> And by who?\n\n1008\n00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:25,960\nAnd at what time?\n\n1009\n00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,740\n>> Yeah, so these are all good points.\n\n1010\n00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,410\nYou put something in there and\nyou need to be careful with log files\n\n1011\n00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:35,100\nbecause those log files will store\ninformation about what you did.\n\n1012\n00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,790\nSo if you purge them, somethings in there.\n\n1013\n00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:38,450\nIf you stop them, theres a big gap.\n\n1014\n00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:41,750\nIt doesn't look right, so\nyou have to be a little more selective.\n\n1015\n00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:46,610\nNow theres tools like wind zapper, is one\nthat will surgically remove stuff for you.\n\n1016\n00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:51,110\nIt's not the only one So\nyou can be a little more, you can set up,\n\n1017\n00:54:51,110 --> 00:54:55,310\njust go using the carpet bomb approach or\nthe hand grenade approach.\n\n1018\n00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:57,650\nUsing a scalpel to\nsurgically remove stuff.\n\n1019\n00:54:57,650 --> 00:54:59,840\nSo that has that advantage.\n\n1020\n00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:07,540\nYou can also, you can do other things with\nlog files but those are only a couple.\n\n1021\n00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,480\nThere's a whole bunch of things for\nmanipulating log files.\n\n1022\n00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,560\nAnd remember log files aren't just\nthe Windows operating system.\n\n1023\n00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,580\nIt is other applications on the system as\nwell, they may have their own log files.\n\n1024\n00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,160\nKeep it in mind,\nthe existence of log files,\n\n1025\n00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:25,530\nwhen you get in actually\nmonkeying with web servers and\n\n1026\n00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,260\nweb applications, cuz they have\ntheir own stuff, in a lot of cases,\n\n1027\n00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,010\nseparate from what\nthe system itself is doing.\n\n1028\n00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:37,080\nSo yeah,\nthey're watching a lot of stuff now.\n\n1029\n00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,130\nThe other thing to keep in mind if\nyou do want to go into the log files\n\n1030\n00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:45,560\nthemselves and do stuff with them,\nit's not uncommon to have a practice where\n\n1031\n00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,120\nthe log files aren't on that system,\nthey're someplace else.\n\n1032\n00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,554\n>> Absolutely,\nthat's a very good point, and\n\n1033\n00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,000\nit's hard to discover something like that.\n\n1034\n00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,699\nIn Linux, I know they let you do log\nshipping where the log possibly shipped to\n\n1035\n00:55:55,699 --> 00:55:56,856\nanother server and\n\n1036\n00:55:56,856 --> 00:56:01,500\nnow Microsoft has finally got around\nto giving us that similar capability.\n\n1037\n00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,000\nWhere I can do event log subscriptions.\n\n1038\n00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,664\nSo you might have wiped the events off of\na particular server that you're attacking,\n\n1039\n00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:13,200\nbut those log files could be duplicated\nsomewhere else on another system you don't\n\n1040\n00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:13,940\nknow about.\n\n1041\n00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,670\nSo, something we got to pay attention to.\n\n1042\n00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:17,540\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1043\n00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:22,992\nDo remember these little things.\n\n1044\n00:56:22,992 --> 00:56:26,660\nI mean, if you do enough on the system,\nthose log files,\n\n1045\n00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:31,160\nif you want to do anything with them,\nthey're someplace else.\n\n1046\n00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,450\nThat's another system you\nhave to compromise and\n\n1047\n00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,140\nmore noise you're going to make.\n\n1048\n00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:36,860\nSo you're going to want to avoid that.\n\n1049\n00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:41,230\nI'd say even question if you need to\ndo anything with log files at all.\n\n1050\n00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:45,760\nIf you do a quick, surgical strike\ninto a system, there may be so\n\n1051\n00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,860\nlittle stuff left in a log file.\n\n1052\n00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,160\nTampering with it may just\nnot be even worth it.\n\n1053\n00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:53,440\n>> Might even make more noise trying\nto cover your tracks then just\n\n1054\n00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,420\nleaving well enough alone and getting in\nand getting out with what you came for.\n\n1055\n00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,780\n>> Yeah, you're absolutely correct there.\n\n1056\n00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,920\nSo there's that one.\n\n1057\n00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:11,150\nBut we have other ways to do stuff on\na system as you may or may not know.\n\n1058\n00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,351\n>> I might want to maybe,\nwhat if I want to come back and\n\n1059\n00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:17,020\nI want to hide some of my tools or some\nof the information that I've gathered.\n\n1060\n00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,930\nWhile I was on those systems.\n\n1061\n00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:24,980\n>> Yeah, there are definitely ways to hide\nstuff on a system that you may in fact,\n\n1062\n00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,460\nthe first one I'll take a look\nat just to kind of before\n\n1063\n00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,630\nwe look at it is something\ncalled alternate data streams.\n\n1064\n00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,000\nAlternate data streams are a fascinating\nfeature, their very existence is\n\n1065\n00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,620\nfascinating, and most people just,\nquite frankly, don't know about it.\n\n1066\n00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,420\nIn fact a lot of you are going\nto hear what I talk about it,\n\n1067\n00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:49,540\nand show you what the commands look like.\n\n1068\n00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:53,468\nI'm going to encourage\nyou to try them as well.\n\n1069\n00:57:53,468 --> 00:57:56,830\nYou're going to see what these tools\nlook like, and what the feature is, and\n\n1070\n00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:59,380\nyou're going to be like, wow,\nI had no idea that even existed,\n\n1071\n00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,510\nthat was even in the product.\n\n1072\n00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,560\nI remember the first time I\nsaw it I was like wait what?\n\n1073\n00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,320\n>> Yeah.\n>> You've got to be kidding me.\n\n1074\n00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,190\nAnd how easy it is to manipulate\nthis stuff and work with it and\n\n1075\n00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,080\nhow difficult it is to find.\n\n1076\n00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,890\nI mean there are some tools that\nwill help us find it but anyway.\n\n1077\n00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,500\n>> Yeah.\n>> Pretty surprising.\n\n1078\n00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,185\nSo get up on the edge of your seat,\nget ready for this one.\n\n1079\n00:58:18,185 --> 00:58:19,660\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, oh yeah.\n\n1080\n00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:20,450\nAbsolutely.\n\n1081\n00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:22,420\nAlternate data stream.\n\n1082\n00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,010\nSo what they are is alternate data\nstreams, or Microsoft's name or\n\n1083\n00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,620\nanother name for\nwhat's called a forked file system.\n\n1084\n00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,910\nWhat it is, is a forked file system\nmeans that we have the main stream and\n\n1085\n00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:37,080\nthen we have a linked stream to it.\n\n1086\n00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:45,380\nAnd so that linkstream, you don't actually\nsee as a manner of normal behavior.\n\n1087\n00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,890\nNow what you store on that linkstream\ncould literally be anything.\n\n1088\n00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:55,780\nIt could be source code for\na file, It could be images,\n\n1089\n00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:00,290\nit could be text files,\nit could be literally anything.\n\n1090\n00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:03,850\n>> Executables,\nresults from your scans and\n\n1091\n00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:07,170\nthings like that that you've got running,\njust anything you want.\n\n1092\n00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,340\nAnything you can normally store on\nthe file system, really, is basically it.\n\n1093\n00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,720\n>> Yeah, that's really it, is that if\nyou can store it in the file system,\n\n1094\n00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,230\nyou can store it on alternate data stream.\n\n1095\n00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,090\nThat's all it is.\n\n1096\n00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:20,290\nBut, if once an alternate data stream is\nthere which it's supported in NTFS right\n\n1097\n00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:25,750\nacross the board and if you once you\nput an alternate stream you insert it\n\n1098\n00:59:25,750 --> 00:59:31,550\nnext to a next to another\nfile as a Link or this fork.\n\n1099\n00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,460\nYou won't see it.\n\n1100\n00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,270\nYou have to specifically go looking for\nit, and you have to know it's there.\n\n1101\n00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,470\n>> Yeah, I mean you take a file\nthat's on an NTFS volume and\n\n1102\n00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:43,470\nyou attach something into that alternate\ndata stream for that particular file,\n\n1103\n00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:45,350\nthe file size doesn't change.\n\n1104\n00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:49,160\nYou double-click on the file, it still\ndoes whatever that file is supposed to do.\n\n1105\n00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,760\nYou don't see it in Windows Explorer.\n\n1106\n00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,740\nYou don't see it in directory\nlistings from the command prompt.\n\n1107\n00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,580\nIt's just not there.\n\n1108\n00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,330\nAnd once you learn about it, thought,\n\n1109\n00:59:56,330 --> 00:59:58,930\nit's not difficult to see\nit if you know it's there.\n\n1110\n00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,810\nAnd there are some tools we\ncan use to try to discover\n\n1111\n01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:03,680\nstuff that's stored in\nthe alternate data stream.\n\n1112\n01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:07,820\nBut, the thing is most people\ndon't even know that it's there.\n\n1113\n01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,640\n>> Yeah.\n\n1114\n01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,570\n>> In fact, I think I learned about\nit when I took [LAUGH] CEH, eight,\n\n1115\n01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,210\nten years ago.\n\n1116\n01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,740\nAnd that was when I first saw it.\n\n1117\n01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:14,840\nI said, holy crap!\n\n1118\n01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,690\nWhat?\n\n1119\n01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:18,390\n>> You know, that's where most people\nheard about it the first time.\n\n1120\n01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,760\nWhat I found is most people,\nwhen they take a CEH,\n\n1121\n01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,920\nthat's their first encounter with it,\nbecause where else do you teach that?\n\n1122\n01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:31,210\nThere's one place, other than this course,\nwhere you might hear about that,\n\n1123\n01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,580\nor will hear about it is when\nyou take a forensics course.\n\n1124\n01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:37,880\nForensic technicians know\nthat these things exist,\n\n1125\n01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:43,580\nand have the tools, which you can\nget as well, to look for this stuff.\n\n1126\n01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,380\n>> The only thing recently,\n\n1127\n01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:49,400\nMicrosoft now has their,\nwhat is it I'm trying to think of?\n\n1128\n01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,660\nThe classifications?\n\n1129\n01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:51,760\nThat you can do with files.\n\n1130\n01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,530\nThe classifications that goes\nalong with having access control.\n\n1131\n01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:01,280\nAnd I saw something written once about\nhow those classifications don't transfer\n\n1132\n01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,550\nwith the file unless\nit's an Office document,\n\n1133\n01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:07,340\nbecause the classifications are actually\nstored in an alternate date stream.\n\n1134\n01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,880\nThat was the first time i have\never heard Microsoft mention\n\n1135\n01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:13,780\nanything about the alternate data stream\n>> My first encounter with alternate data\n\n1136\n01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:18,060\nstreams was way back if\nyou can believe in NT31.\n\n1137\n01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,650\nThe first version of it in the early 90's.\n\n1138\n01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:28,670\nMy normal thing is I like\nto poke around in things,\n\n1139\n01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:32,080\nfinding ways to hide and\nmanipulate stuff on a system, and\n\n1140\n01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,510\nit was actually easier to find\nthe feature at that point and time.\n\n1141\n01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:40,340\nTo understand why, Microsoft at\nthe time was trying to push more into\n\n1142\n01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,530\nthe networking market with their product.\n\n1143\n01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,020\nAnd so, what they did was is\nthey had a Novel out there,\n\n1144\n01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,910\nand then they, Apple at one time\nhad the networking technology.\n\n1145\n01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:53,530\nApple is really the one\nthat came up with this, and\n\n1146\n01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:56,360\nthey really kind of came up with\nusing this in the first place.\n\n1147\n01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,990\nWhat they did is they found\nthat it was easier to\n\n1148\n01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:03,970\nlocalize applications if they\nput a main executable, and\n\n1149\n01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:09,290\nthen having all the resource files\nstored separately in a linked file.\n\n1150\n01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:13,980\nAnd so this executable would call\non this linked resource file and\n\n1151\n01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:18,610\nextract stuff and show you the toolbars,\nand icons, all in different languages.\n\n1152\n01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:20,050\nThey said if they put it\nin this external one,\n\n1153\n01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,955\nit was easier to localize than it would\nif it was all embedded in the same thing\n\n1154\n01:02:22,955 --> 01:02:25,690\nbecause they'd have to recompile\nthe whole application.\n\n1155\n01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,540\nSo, that's what they used it for.\n\n1156\n01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:32,844\nAnd so Microsoft's saying, well,\nwe have been using a forked file system\n\n1157\n01:02:32,844 --> 01:02:37,840\non the HPFS and HPFS plus later,\nthe High Performance File System.\n\n1158\n01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:41,200\nThey just went ahead and said if\nwe're going to make sure they can't\n\n1159\n01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,690\nget into this market or we can get in,\n\n1160\n01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:49,060\nwhat they did is say we're going to\nsupport NTFS and it made it easier for\n\n1161\n01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:53,460\nthose two to co-exist and eventually for\nthem to take over that market.\n\n1162\n01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,070\n>> Right,\na compatibility thing at that point.\n\n1163\n01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:00,580\n>> Exactly, and so since then,\nit's just existed, it's just been there,\n\n1164\n01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:02,570\nit got to be less publicized.\n\n1165\n01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,840\nApple really is not a player\nin the networking space.\n\n1166\n01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:07,880\nNo matter what,\nhowever you want to spin it.\n\n1167\n01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,160\nThey're not a player there.\n\n1168\n01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,740\nBut that feature has been supported for\na long time and Microsoft does use it now.\n\n1169\n01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:17,625\nThey've used it in different\nplaces along the way.\n\n1170\n01:03:17,625 --> 01:03:20,515\nBut now that you use the net you can\ndownload files from the Internet,\n\n1171\n01:03:20,515 --> 01:03:23,335\nif you've ever wondered why Excel,\nor Word, or something,\n\n1172\n01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:27,515\nwhen you download something it says, this\ncame from an unknown source, I'm going to\n\n1173\n01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:30,105\nopen it as read only, or this file has\nbeen downloaded from the internet.\n\n1174\n01:03:30,105 --> 01:03:31,725\nHow does it know that?\n\n1175\n01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:33,515\nAlternate Data Stream.\n\n1176\n01:03:33,515 --> 01:03:36,895\nSo it stores special codes in the\nAlternate Data Stream that tell it where\n\n1177\n01:03:36,895 --> 01:03:41,280\nit came from, so\napplications that are stream compliant.\n\n1178\n01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,790\nWhich basically most of the modern\napplications are going to see that and\n\n1179\n01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:50,790\nsay no I'm not going to\nopen that as anything but\n\n1180\n01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:55,325\na read only file, so\nmost people hear about it.\n\n1181\n01:03:55,325 --> 01:03:59,295\nMost people I've run into, you're\nnot the person to say that you know.\n\n1182\n01:03:59,295 --> 01:04:02,755\nHey, an alternate data stream,\nI heard about that in this class.\n\n1183\n01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:07,045\nYeah, that's just kind\nof how it approaches.\n\n1184\n01:04:07,045 --> 01:04:12,680\nI've had countless students over\nthe years in this class say, what now?\n\n1185\n01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,180\n[LAUGH] You know.\n\n1186\n01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,340\n>> It is interesting to learn about\nsomething like that that's been there\n\n1187\n01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:23,270\nall along and has this amazing capability,\nand just didn't know about it.\n\n1188\n01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:25,370\n>> Yeah, I was one of the oddballs,\nwhich isn't unusual for\n\n1189\n01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:29,220\nme that I'd actually gone through and\nplayed with it and all that before.\n\n1190\n01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,880\nIt was like, oh, yeah,\nwhat's the big deal?\n\n1191\n01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:32,710\nAlternate data streams?\n\n1192\n01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,200\nYeah, they're there.\n\n1193\n01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,230\nBut, now you know about it,\nbut, let's talk about it.\n\n1194\n01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,670\nLet's talk about the importance here and\nhow you use it.\n\n1195\n01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:45,340\nWhat I have on my screen\nto make things easy.\n\n1196\n01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:48,830\nWhat I put on my screen\nis I have the commands,\n\n1197\n01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:51,740\nand we can zoom that up a bit for you.\n\n1198\n01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:56,620\nI have the commands we can use\nto use alternate data streams.\n\n1199\n01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:00,350\nInstead of typing them in, I just put\nthem here in black and white for you.\n\n1200\n01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:04,430\nThe first command is using Notepad\nto create an alternate data stream.\n\n1201\n01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,560\nNotice the format of\nthings going on there.\n\n1202\n01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:11,230\nWe see myfile.txt, and\nthen we see the new.txt.\n\n1203\n01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,180\nWhat's actually being created there\nin that first one is the new.txt.\n\n1204\n01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,710\nIt's not creating the myfile.txt.\n\n1205\n01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:19,120\nWhat's significant about this,\n\n1206\n01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:23,620\nis when you do this in Notepad, Notepad\nbeing a stream compliant application,\n\n1207\n01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:27,370\nwill open up that newfile.txt, and\nyou can put whatever you want in it.\n\n1208\n01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:31,350\nOkay, so once you have done that,\nyou will save that.\n\n1209\n01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:36,090\nWhatever size that my file .txt was\noriginally, it will still be that size.\n\n1210\n01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:39,140\nIf it was a meg it will still be a meg.\n\n1211\n01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:43,250\nIf the new .txt, if you want to reopen it\nthen you can type the same thing in it but\n\n1212\n01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:44,520\nopen it back up.\n\n1213\n01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,900\nYou can put more content in it.\n\n1214\n01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,970\nYou could open it,\nyou could make it 10 megs in size.\n\n1215\n01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:53,770\nYou save it, you do a directory or\ngo to explorer, whichever one you want,\n\n1216\n01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:59,880\nit's still going to say one meg for\nmyfile.txt, new won't even show up.\n\n1217\n01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,930\nIt just won't show up in explorer or\ndirectory listing.\n\n1218\n01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:09,380\nYou have to know that it's there and\ntype something like that out to find it.\n\n1219\n01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:15,370\nNow, if you don't want to create a new\none like that, down in Notepad a bit.\n\n1220\n01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:20,190\nYou can see I put the move part of it,\nthat move, which you you just type and\n\n1221\n01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:21,920\nI put that evil.exe.\n\n1222\n01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,950\nLet that represent your keylogger or\nwhatever it is you want to get out of\n\n1223\n01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:29,260\nthat system and hide,\nwhat I've done is I've set type.\n\n1224\n01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,350\nAnd then you can say I put that little,\nyou know, greater than symbol.\n\n1225\n01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:37,230\nAnd then I'm saying take this file and\nstick it on the back that readme.txt.\n\n1226\n01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:40,660\nWhat's going to happen is your directory\nlisting or explorer, same deal.\n\n1227\n01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:47,660\nThat readme.txt will show up,\nbut the evil.exe will not.\n\n1228\n01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:48,570\nIf you want to run it.\n\n1229\n01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,670\n>> Mm.\n>> And you can see in there I can do that\n\n1230\n01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,780\nstart command and\nspecifically call it out.\n\n1231\n01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:56,010\nAnd in that case I'm going to\ndo start with the readme.txt and\n\n1232\n01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:58,480\nthe colon dot evil.exe.\n\n1233\n01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,620\nIt will run the evil command.\n\n1234\n01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,101\nIt won't touch the readme.txt.\n\n1235\n01:07:04,101 --> 01:07:04,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1236\n01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,060\n>> Okay.\nIf you want to run,\n\n1237\n01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,763\nif you want to look at the readme.txt\nyou just have to put that in.\n\n1238\n01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:09,450\n>> [CROSSTALK] yeah.\n\n1239\n01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,240\n>> And it will open it up.\n\n1240\n01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:14,830\nYou know, so\nnote what the format is there.\n\n1241\n01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:19,050\nThe one I didn't put there, if you want to\ntake that, if you wanted in this example\n\n1242\n01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:23,120\nto get rid of that evil.exe,\nthe way to get rid of that would be to\n\n1243\n01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:26,540\nrun something called, well, one of\nthe ways is to run something called cat.\n\n1244\n01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:31,010\nWhich is available in\nthe resource kits for Windows.\n\n1245\n01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:36,790\nYou can also go on a Microsoft or\nGoogle the cat.exe utility.\n\n1246\n01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:42,360\nAnd at that point you can say cat it will\nactually pop that file off the back of it.\n\n1247\n01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:44,830\nIt's got a syntax for it as well.\n\n1248\n01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:49,440\nNow the question is is how do you\nfind this alternate data streams.\n\n1249\n01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,520\nAlternate data streams,\n\n1250\n01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,950\nthere's utilities that are specifically\ndesigned to look for that.\n\n1251\n01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:58,330\nThere's streams is one that will do it,\nI saw someone mention in the discussion\n\n1252\n01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:02,410\ngroup, there's just\na bunch of them out there.\n\n1253\n01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:04,820\nIf you want to eliminate\nalternate data streams,\n\n1254\n01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:08,070\nwhich I think in some cases\nmight be a good idea.\n\n1255\n01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,480\nBut, you might want to\nbe careful doing that.\n\n1256\n01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,840\nOne of the ways you can do\nit is you can actually take\n\n1257\n01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,450\nthe file that you believe has\nan alternative data stream on it and\n\n1258\n01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:23,380\ncopy it over to a fat local,\na file system if you've got one available.\n\n1259\n01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:28,120\nAnd fat doesn't support it will strip the\nalternate data stream right off that file.\n\n1260\n01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,180\nThing to remember though is,\nis that, you know,\n\n1261\n01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:35,910\none of the things I'll put out there\nis a PC counsel well their own stuff.\n\n1262\n01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:40,540\nYou know again kind of trying to say\nthe practical versus what they test on.\n\n1263\n01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:45,860\nOne of the things that they will\nrecommend is you know taking for\n\n1264\n01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:50,330\nexample, someone was able to do this to\nyour Windows file system, or sorry your\n\n1265\n01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:54,600\nWindows directory and start tacking\nstuff on the back of Windows files.\n\n1266\n01:08:54,600 --> 01:09:01,540\nThere are some, if they say well take the\nfiles and copy them to a fat file system.\n\n1267\n01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:04,260\nYeah, for some of your documents folder,\ndo that however you want,\n\n1268\n01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,570\nif that's your cup of tea, do it.\n\n1269\n01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:10,730\nHowever, if you try, can you imagine.\n\n1270\n01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:11,640\nTurn your system on so\n\n1271\n01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:14,700\nI am going to copy the whole Windows\nfolder over to a fat file system.\n\n1272\n01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,485\nYeah good luck,\ngood luck rebuilding your system.\n\n1273\n01:09:17,485 --> 01:09:19,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I should do it should be sane,\n\n1274\n01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,650\nit's not going to be\na practical way to do things.\n\n1275\n01:09:22,650 --> 01:09:26,360\nSo you got to use your\nbest judgement to do that,\n\n1276\n01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:30,100\nthat to me just kinda screams\nas being impractical and dumb.\n\n1277\n01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:34,500\n>> And for Dr. who out there that\nis exactly what he is saying,\n\n1278\n01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:39,320\nyou got that simple .exe file,\nand you heighten that evil.exe in\n\n1279\n01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:43,520\nthe alternate data stream for\nthat text file.\n\n1280\n01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,940\nAnd I think we had one from Mikalea\ntalking about steganography which is\n\n1281\n01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:50,388\nwhat we are getting\nready to get into next.\n\n1282\n01:09:50,388 --> 01:09:52,655\n>> That's the next step.\nIt's a similar concept, but\n\n1283\n01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:58,050\nunlike encryption, or cryptography\nwhere we are encrypting something.\n\n1284\n01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,790\nWe're not attempting to hide\nthe fact that it's there.\n\n1285\n01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:03,060\nWe're just making it so\nthat you can't access it or\n\n1286\n01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,320\nyou can't read it without\nthe proper decryption.\n\n1287\n01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:10,690\nSteganography, ADS, now we're hiding\nthe fact that the data is even there,\n\n1288\n01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:12,150\nwhich I think is the big difference there.\n\n1289\n01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:14,140\nAnd that's why those two relate.\n\n1290\n01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,410\nBecause they're not encrypting the data,\n\n1291\n01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:19,480\nthey're not doing anything like that,\nwe're just hiding it in plain sight.\n\n1292\n01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,320\nYou can see the original file,\n\n1293\n01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,820\nwhat you don't know is there's things\nwithin that you just don't see.\n\n1294\n01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:26,180\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1295\n01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:26,680\nAbsolutely.\n\n1296\n01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:28,626\n>> All right.\n\n1297\n01:10:28,626 --> 01:10:31,330\nAnd I think [INAUDIBLE] only in DFS, and\n\n1298\n01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:36,720\nas we just stated, really this came\nfrom some of the old Apple file systems.\n\n1299\n01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:40,470\n>> Yeah, and to be fair, forked file\nsystems are something that the concept has\n\n1300\n01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,550\nexisted even before Apple\ndid anything with it.\n\n1301\n01:10:43,550 --> 01:10:46,980\nIt was something they played around\nwith on Unix and stuff like that.\n\n1302\n01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:50,260\nIt just really kind of came\ninto its own with the HPFS and\n\n1303\n01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,290\nHPFS plus file system that Apple used.\n\n1304\n01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,940\nThey're the first ones to\nreally make use of it.\n\n1305\n01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:57,700\nAnd then Microsoft did it for\nthe reasons I told you.\n\n1306\n01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:04,050\nFor compatibility and\nas well to take over the market.\n\n1307\n01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:05,820\n>> And, so does Windows, Sean's asking me,\n\n1308\n01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:08,700\ndoes the Windows system utilize\nall data streams by default?\n\n1309\n01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,365\nAnd that's one of the things you want to\ncheck before you start turning it off.\n\n1310\n01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:14,340\nCause you might have\nsomething that uses it.\n\n1311\n01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,320\nThe only thing that I know about,\nas a relatively recent concept,\n\n1312\n01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:23,050\nwhich is classifications and\nthen biomanagement tasks.\n\n1313\n01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:28,420\nAnd if it's a non office document,\nthat's not created through office,\n\n1314\n01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:32,870\nthen those classifications get stored in\nan alternate data stream, like a text file\n\n1315\n01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:37,040\nJPEG's things like that if you do\nclassifications of those documents\n\n1316\n01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:41,520\nthat's stored in the ADS office documents\nit's stored as a part of the metadata of\n\n1317\n01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,470\nthe office document itself but, we'll\ncover that if you go back into some of our\n\n1318\n01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:49,960\nWindows server classes more the I want\nto say four thirteen or one of those.\n\n1319\n01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:55,790\nWe'll talk about the file classifications,\nand the classification manager tasks.\n\n1320\n01:11:55,790 --> 01:11:59,200\nWe'll talk about that there\na little more in depth.\n\n1321\n01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,140\n>> Yeah, just be wary.\n\n1322\n01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,000\nI see these questions in here anyway.\n\n1323\n01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000\nAny downside to killing alternate data\nstreams on an entire NTFS volume?\n\n1324\n01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,750\nYeah, don't do that.\n\n1325\n01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:10,670\nJust plain and simple, don't do that.\n\n1326\n01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:13,590\nYou're gonna cause yourself all problems.\n\n1327\n01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:16,540\nYou will break the operating system,\nlet's just put it that way.\n\n1328\n01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:22,704\nKilling alternate data streams it's kinda\n\n1329\n01:12:22,704 --> 01:12:27,237\nnot to pick on it, it's an odd question,\n\n1330\n01:12:27,237 --> 01:12:33,080\nbecause altered data streams\nare supported by NTFS.\n\n1331\n01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:38,200\nNot every file uses them, and\nthe files that typically use them as\n\n1332\n01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,250\na part of their normal operating,\nthey're supposed to use that.\n\n1333\n01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,020\nThey use them for various reasons.\n\n1334\n01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:45,490\nWhere did you get the file from?\n\n1335\n01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:47,890\nWhere's some extended data to put on it?\n\n1336\n01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:50,470\nJust leave them alone.\n\n1337\n01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:53,200\nThere are tools that do this, like I said.\n\n1338\n01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:57,450\nThe tools that use this will\nscan the whole file system and\n\n1339\n01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:59,200\nshow you alternate data streams.\n\n1340\n01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,020\nIt's up to you at that\npoint to go through and\n\n1341\n01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,230\nuse your best judgement on which\none of those might be malicious.\n\n1342\n01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:09,980\nAnd I'm telling you Why we use this as\na feature here as an attack vector,\n\n1343\n01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:13,630\ndon't think that it's something\nyou're gonna have a bunch of\n\n1344\n01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,490\nmalicious alternate data\nstreams on your system.\n\n1345\n01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:18,420\nIf you went to your system now and\nrent all of these tools to\n\n1346\n01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:21,665\nfind these alternate data streams,\nyou're going to find a lot of them.\n\n1347\n01:13:21,665 --> 01:13:24,690\n[COUGH] We don't want you to flip out.\n\n1348\n01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:26,330\n>> Right.\n>> We don't want you to go, oh my God,\n\n1349\n01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:27,480\nlook it's coming right at us.\n\n1350\n01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:30,090\nNo, it's supposed to be there.\n\n1351\n01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:32,390\nDon't just start deleting\nthings because they're,\n\n1352\n01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:36,070\nbecause you're kinda concerned\nit might be used for evil.\n\n1353\n01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:38,310\nYou know, they might, but probably not.\n\n1354\n01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,170\n>> Right.\nYeah, so\n\n1355\n01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:40,850\nmost of it's not gonna be malicious.\n\n1356\n01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,920\nIt's used for, you know,\nthat's why it's there.\n\n1357\n01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,590\nIf it wasn't used by anything legitimately\nthen we'd probably get rid of it.\n\n1358\n01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,060\nIf we didn't need it for\ncompatibility or have some use for\n\n1359\n01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,460\nit It would be gone by now.\n\n1360\n01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:56,820\nHopefully it would be gone by now we know\nhow Microsoft works not always the case.\n\n1361\n01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:02,740\nAll right so ADS is one way I can hide\ninformation, executables, files, whatever.\n\n1362\n01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:05,310\nWe also have something that we\nmentioned just a second ago and\n\n1363\n01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:08,000\nwe wanna expand upon is steganography.\n\n1364\n01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:15,510\n>> Yes, this is a really,\nreally nice thing to see.\n\n1365\n01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:17,939\nSteganography, what it is?\n\n1366\n01:14:17,939 --> 01:14:23,730\nit's the process of hiding\nsomething inside of something else.\n\n1367\n01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:29,825\nThat's just what you do, is you're\ntaking file and you're putting it,\n\n1368\n01:14:29,825 --> 01:14:34,505\nso you're putting it inside of a, another\nfile, or another item or whatever it is.\n\n1369\n01:14:34,505 --> 01:14:37,325\nYou have some, the technical term\nis you have a cover text and\n\n1370\n01:14:37,325 --> 01:14:39,505\nthen you've got the payload\nyou're putting inside of it.\n\n1371\n01:14:39,505 --> 01:14:40,755\nNow if you know,\nif you want to call it that.\n\n1372\n01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:44,170\nWe can do it with really anything.\n\n1373\n01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:44,950\nI can do it with text.\n\n1374\n01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,040\nI can do it with images.\n\n1375\n01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:47,427\nI can do it with.\n\n1376\n01:14:47,427 --> 01:14:48,440\nI can do it with audio.\n\n1377\n01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:49,670\nI can do it with video.\n\n1378\n01:14:49,670 --> 01:14:52,550\nAnd there's tools for\nall of these, by the way.\n\n1379\n01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:57,100\nThere's literally tools\nto do every little thing.\n\n1380\n01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:05,040\nIt just depends on what you wanna do,\nand how you wanna hide it.\n\n1381\n01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,300\nFor example,\nyou can hide a PDF inside an image.\n\n1382\n01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:15,110\nWhat's really neat about that is if you\ndo that, you can take that image and\n\n1383\n01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:16,530\npost it on a website.\n\n1384\n01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,980\nI can post an executable as one of\nmy bad boys hiding in that thing and\n\n1385\n01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,560\nstick it on a website.\n\n1386\n01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,160\nAnyone else may see a picture of a beach.\n\n1387\n01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:29,200\nOr I can take my vacation photos,\nsome of my vacation photos from last week\n\n1388\n01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:33,880\nwhen I was in Hawaii, take those pictures,\nbed PDFs and executables in them, put them\n\n1389\n01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,170\non a site, and people are going hey, Shawn\nwas in Hawaii, look check that out, and\n\n1390\n01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:40,890\nthey're looking at all my pictures and\ngoing that looks nice, that looks nice.\n\n1391\n01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:43,680\nThey're looking at it, meanwhile,\nI go outside their company,\n\n1392\n01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:48,600\nbrowse to my website via vacation\npictures, right click download, and\n\n1393\n01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,000\nthen just extract that payload from it and\nuse it against you.\n\n1394\n01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,550\nEveryone else it's an image,\nto me it's a delivery system.\n\n1395\n01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:01,970\nSo, it can be quite nasty when it,\nin the right hands.\n\n1396\n01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:05,790\nYou can do it with,\nlike I said, audio, video.\n\n1397\n01:16:05,790 --> 01:16:09,495\nIf I wanted to hide something\nthat gets sufficiently large.\n\n1398\n01:16:09,495 --> 01:16:14,805\nI can even hide stuff inside video cuz\nthat may be the best way to do it.\n\n1399\n01:16:14,805 --> 01:16:17,495\nIf you have something like 10 or\n20 Megs and\n\n1400\n01:16:17,495 --> 01:16:20,395\nyou have an image that's\nonly 1024 by 768 let's say.\n\n1401\n01:16:20,395 --> 01:16:28,022\nIf you you saw 1024 by 768 that is 10\nmegs in size, that's probably gonna raise\n\n1402\n01:16:28,022 --> 01:16:32,422\nsome eyebrows cause you're looking\nat going, that doesnt' really fit.\n\n1403\n01:16:32,422 --> 01:16:35,452\nThat's not a high resolution\nwith all that stuff in it.\n\n1404\n01:16:35,452 --> 01:16:38,982\nSo take that larger thing and\nhide it inside a video file.\n\n1405\n01:16:38,982 --> 01:16:41,842\n>> Right.\n>> Video file, you do expect that size so\n\n1406\n01:16:41,842 --> 01:16:45,640\nit's a lot easier\n>> To get away with that, so\n\n1407\n01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,540\nthere some neat stuff there.\n\n1408\n01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,240\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1409\n01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:52,010\nThis can be used for so many different\nthings, hiding stuff in plain sight,\n\n1410\n01:16:52,010 --> 01:16:53,640\nas Shawn was saying.\n\n1411\n01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,760\nIf I'm worried about\nmaybe I'm going to be,\n\n1412\n01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,080\nmy removable media is gonna\nbe scanned on the way out.\n\n1413\n01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,650\nI could have some pictures or some MP3s on\nthere and hide something within those and\n\n1414\n01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:07,600\nif somebody looks at it all\nthey're gonna see is like\n\n1415\n01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,580\nyou should have the pictures or MP3's\nthey don't know the other stuff is there.\n\n1416\n01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:15,720\nI've seen browsers, there was one called\ncamera shy, I believe was the name of it.\n\n1417\n01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:20,890\nAnd it was a browser and\nyou could take pictures and\n\n1418\n01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:25,470\npost them up on your website and you'd\nhave images hidden within, or not images,\n\n1419\n01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:27,800\nyou would have information\nhidden within those images.\n\n1420\n01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:32,680\n>> Anybody else goes to that website\nwith Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox,\n\n1421\n01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,140\nwhatever, they just see those pictures,\neven if they go there with Camera Shy,\n\n1422\n01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,490\nthey just see the pictures.\n\n1423\n01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:40,400\nBut if you go to Camera Shy with that,\nif you use Camera Shy to go\n\n1424\n01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,590\ngo to that website, and\nyou type in the appropriate password,\n\n1425\n01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:47,960\nall of the sudden you see that hidden\ninformation that is within those images.\n\n1426\n01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,750\nAnd it really is taking advantage of\na lot of these files that we call least\n\n1427\n01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:53,790\nsignificant bits or\nbits that are bits that are unnecessary.\n\n1428\n01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:58,480\nIn pictures,\nthere's a lot of repeated information and\n\n1429\n01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:00,260\nit can remove some of that.\n\n1430\n01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,030\nAnd that's where it's actually\nstoring that data, and\n\n1431\n01:18:03,030 --> 01:18:08,200\nit modifies the image in a way that's\nimperceivable to us, in the most part.\n\n1432\n01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,670\n>> That's exactly right.\n\n1433\n01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:11,410\nIf you have a piece of\ninformation to hide and\n\n1434\n01:18:11,410 --> 01:18:15,450\nyou hide it inside an image,\nit does take that least significant bit.\n\n1435\n01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:18,580\nAnd why that's a big deal is,\nif you think about it,\n\n1436\n01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:22,270\nwhat if you have the number 1 million?\n\n1437\n01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:27,350\nYou know, if I change the one all\nthe way to the left-hand side to a two,\n\n1438\n01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,080\nI've just doubled that value.\n\n1439\n01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:31,050\nBut if I take that zero\nall the way to right and\n\n1440\n01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:34,690\nchange it from a zero to a one,\nthat's not that big of a difference.\n\n1441\n01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:38,860\n>> Yeah, and we talk about the way colors\nare represented in an image, it's in bits,\n\n1442\n01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:46,820\nand if you've got, I'm trying to think,\n16 million, 600 or 700,000 colors.\n\n1443\n01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:50,460\nIf I take one or two bits off the end of\nthat color, it might change the shade of\n\n1444\n01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:55,540\npink or red just a hair, but\nit's not gonna be perceivable.\n\n1445\n01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:58,310\nI do find that this works best\nwith uncompressed file formats,\n\n1446\n01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,640\nwith Jpegs being compressed, you don't\nhave as much free space, if you will,\n\n1447\n01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,910\nwithin that image but it still works.\n\n1448\n01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:06,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n1449\n01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,845\nIt depends on the situation, really.\n\n1450\n01:19:08,845 --> 01:19:10,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It goes back down to that is\n\n1451\n01:19:10,740 --> 01:19:13,400\nan uncompressed image might be\n\n1452\n01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:17,580\na better delivery mechanism because\nyou've got more to play with.\n\n1453\n01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> But you might say, well,\n\n1454\n01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:24,520\nif I have a jpg and it's compressed and\nI have something sufficiently small.\n\n1455\n01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:29,210\nYou know, put it in there,\nmight be just fine, but\n\n1456\n01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:34,510\nif it's a larger one, maybe you might ask\nis it better to use an uncompressed image,\n\n1457\n01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:37,040\nor better to move to an audio or\nvideo file.\n\n1458\n01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,990\nBecause that may be\na better way to hide it,\n\n1459\n01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:43,520\na large image may still attract attention,\nbut it's not a bad choice.\n\n1460\n01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,424\nYou gotta remember,\nuse the right cover text for\n\n1461\n01:19:48,424 --> 01:19:51,300\nthe particular situation.\n\n1462\n01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,843\nIf you used the wrong one,\nlike Mike's suggesting, instead of using\n\n1463\n01:19:55,843 --> 01:20:00,540\nan uncompressed file you use a JPEG\nthat's got a good resolution to it and\n\n1464\n01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:04,544\nyou shove something that's too\nlarge into it and it says hey,\n\n1465\n01:20:04,544 --> 01:20:07,630\nwell we have all developed\nkind of an eye for it.\n\n1466\n01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:10,472\nIf you see a JPEG that's supposed\nto be a certain size, and\n\n1467\n01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:13,836\nit's a certain resolution,\ncertain quality, if I hand it to you and\n\n1468\n01:20:13,836 --> 01:20:17,070\nit says that's a 20 meg JPEG file,\nlike what?\n\n1469\n01:20:17,070 --> 01:20:18,780\nThat doesn't happen all that often.\n\n1470\n01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:20,900\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> Even the average Joe knows that now,\n\n1471\n01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:24,160\ncuz they got cameras on their cellphone,\nso they're gonna look and go,\n\n1472\n01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:25,630\nthat's not right.\n\n1473\n01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:27,050\nYou would probably look at it and\nsay, okay,\n\n1474\n01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:29,930\nthat's not supposed to be that size,\nsomething fishy's going on.\n\n1475\n01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:32,730\n>> And that should answer, I think,\nDeborah, it kinda answers your question.\n\n1476\n01:20:32,730 --> 01:20:36,950\nUnlike alternate data streams\nthis does modify the actual file.\n\n1477\n01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:41,100\nSo if you're paying attention,\nyou might see this increased file size,\n\n1478\n01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:46,040\nand that could tip you off that\nthere is something hidden.\n\n1479\n01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,760\nBut it is kinda difficult to detect.\n\n1480\n01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:49,500\n>> Yeah, it can't be.\n\n1481\n01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:52,930\nIn fact, I've got,\nI'll show you on my screen right here,\n\n1482\n01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:58,020\nI've got a website called Spam Mimic,\nwhich is a proof of concept site.\n\n1483\n01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:02,560\nYou can just type in Spam Mimic and\nfind it, quite easily.\n\n1484\n01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,964\nThis is not something that is\ngonna be used in production, but\n\n1485\n01:21:04,964 --> 01:21:07,330\nit's something that will\nshow what's going on.\n\n1486\n01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:10,640\nWhat I can do here, is I can type in,\nencode a secret message.\n\n1487\n01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:11,640\nI can do hello.\n\n1488\n01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:16,980\nWorld, I'll type that in and\nsay encode, and what this does,\n\n1489\n01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:21,590\nit uses an algorithm to create a very\nholistic looking spam message.\n\n1490\n01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:29,060\nSo you can see in here it's a spam message\nabout a multi-level marketing scheme.\n\n1491\n01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:33,110\nSo, okay, if I take this.\n\n1492\n01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:38,000\nAnd I'll say I'll take it and copy it and\ngo back to the main spam mimic site and\n\n1493\n01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,400\nsay decode.\n\n1494\n01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:44,340\nI will go out here and\nright click and paste.\n\n1495\n01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,670\nOkay there's my spam messages as had.\n\n1496\n01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,680\nI do a decode and what happens?\n\n1497\n01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:50,700\nBoom.\nStuff comes back.\n\n1498\n01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,240\nSo you just saw in real time.\n\n1499\n01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:54,280\nWhat this does.\n\n1500\n01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:58,050\nThis one will even do\na couple other types of this.\n\n1501\n01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:02,010\nIt will say encode as a space.\n\n1502\n01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:06,570\nIf I say, okay, here's my message.\n\n1503\n01:22:06,570 --> 01:22:10,010\nHere's my hello world, and\nI paste a subtext saying this is\n\n1504\n01:22:11,110 --> 01:22:16,260\na text message,\njust do something like that.\n\n1505\n01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:20,020\nIf I say encode, well what happened?\n\n1506\n01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:21,670\nIt merged everything, right?\n\n1507\n01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:23,335\nWell it hasn't merge everything.\n\n1508\n01:22:23,335 --> 01:22:26,288\nIt just took all my stuff.\n\n1509\n01:22:26,288 --> 01:22:27,675\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1510\n01:22:27,675 --> 01:22:30,695\njust spread it as random bits out there.\n\n1511\n01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:34,365\nAnd I mean, heck, even if you did\nwhat I just did right there and\n\n1512\n01:22:34,365 --> 01:22:38,455\nhighlighted all of it, how do you know\nthat it's not just a transmission problem,\n\n1513\n01:22:38,455 --> 01:22:44,215\nor somebody got kind of anxious or\nhappy with the return key.\n\n1514\n01:22:44,215 --> 01:22:46,525\nIt's still gonna work.\n\n1515\n01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:52,480\nNow if I go out here and copy and\npaste and do a decode, boom, there you go.\n\n1516\n01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,800\n>> Right.\n>> This reverses the operation.\n\n1517\n01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,030\nAnd you'll notice the site it\nwill do one in Russian, and\n\n1518\n01:22:58,030 --> 01:23:00,650\nstuff like that if you need that I guess.\n\n1519\n01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:04,680\nIt's the same concept if you do images,\naudio, or whatever.\n\n1520\n01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,450\nIt's the exact same type of thing.\n\n1521\n01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:08,540\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1522\n01:23:08,540 --> 01:23:10,140\nAnd to answer a question out there.\n\n1523\n01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:14,970\nWilliam was asking, would you have to\ninsure it was a Windows based file server.\n\n1524\n01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:19,193\nAnd no, this is really, it's not\nanything to do with the file system or\n\n1525\n01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:21,365\nthe operating system or\nanything like that, right.\n\n1526\n01:23:21,365 --> 01:23:23,939\nThis is dealing with the file type itself,\nso\n\n1527\n01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:28,613\nI mean all of our file systems support\nbitmaps, and jpegs, and things like that,\n\n1528\n01:23:28,613 --> 01:23:29,937\nso-\n>> Yeah,\n\n1529\n01:23:29,937 --> 01:23:34,944\njust look at it like this William.\n\n1530\n01:23:36,085 --> 01:23:41,755\nJust ask yourself, can I take a JPEG from\nmy box here which is a Windows 8.1 box and\n\n1531\n01:23:41,755 --> 01:23:44,995\nmove it to a LINUX, UNIX,\na MAC, or West System?\n\n1532\n01:23:44,995 --> 01:23:46,915\nThe answer is yes, you can do that.\n\n1533\n01:23:46,915 --> 01:23:48,670\nIt wouldn't be a problem.\n\n1534\n01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:51,750\nAll those file systems are just\na way of storing information.\n\n1535\n01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:54,640\nThe stuff that we're talking\nabout is actually happening\n\n1536\n01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:56,840\nwithin that piece of data so\nwe don't care.\n\n1537\n01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:57,340\n>> Yep.\n\n1538\n01:23:57,340 --> 01:24:00,160\nYeah and once it's in there I mean\nI can copy it to a thumb drive,\n\n1539\n01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,190\nto anything else and take it with me.\n\n1540\n01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:07,930\nSo, it's independent and I'm gonna put\na link out there if you guys do as well,\n\n1541\n01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:10,650\nfor a program I like to\nplay with sometimes.\n\n1542\n01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,290\nIt's a cheap easy free\nlittle steganography\n\n1543\n01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,760\nwhere you can kinda practice with it.\n\n1544\n01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:18,060\nSo take a look at that one as well.\n\n1545\n01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:21,750\nIt's something where you can pick\nan image, put in your secret text, and\n\n1546\n01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:23,590\nthen it'll merge it together for you.\n\n1547\n01:24:23,590 --> 01:24:27,210\nAnd gives you an idea of what\nyou can do with steganography.\n\n1548\n01:24:27,210 --> 01:24:30,880\n>> There's another one by the way\nthat I use called Invisible Secrets.\n\n1549\n01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:38,090\nIt does it with images as well, so the one\nthat Mike is suggesting is a great one.\n\n1550\n01:24:38,090 --> 01:24:40,700\nInvisible Secrets is a good one.\n\n1551\n01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:44,430\nThere's MP3stego for MP3s.\n\n1552\n01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:49,430\nThere's just all sorts of ones out\nthere that you can play with and\n\n1553\n01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:50,680\nsee what they do.\n\n1554\n01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:56,150\nIt has its uses in\n\n1555\n01:24:56,150 --> 01:25:00,620\nnormal stuff to hide things, but\nwe can use it as pen testers as well.\n\n1556\n01:25:02,050 --> 01:25:07,490\nWhat was the, did I see the question\nup here about detection of it?\n\n1557\n01:25:07,490 --> 01:25:10,080\nI see several things here about detection.\n\n1558\n01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:14,470\nCan you detect, I guess I'll just\nencapsulate several of your questions here\n\n1559\n01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:17,660\nin the discussion,\nis how would you detect it?\n\n1560\n01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,930\nWell there's a process called steganalysis\nthat's specifically designed to\n\n1561\n01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:22,340\ndetect this.\n\n1562\n01:25:22,340 --> 01:25:23,650\nThere's software that does it.\n\n1563\n01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:27,790\nThe software will use pattern analysis and\nstatistical analysis to look for\n\n1564\n01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,620\nthings that are anomalous.\n\n1565\n01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:34,440\nYou can also,\nif someone was lazy for example, and\n\n1566\n01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,200\nhad the original image and had an image\nthat you embedded something into and\n\n1567\n01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,415\nthey left them both in place,\nnow you can compare the two.\n\n1568\n01:25:40,415 --> 01:25:42,210\n>> Then you see that the file\nsizes are different.\n\n1569\n01:25:42,210 --> 01:25:44,190\nI've got two images that\nare exactly the same.\n\n1570\n01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,570\n>> That would be an even\nmore interesting one,\n\n1571\n01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:49,100\nif you saw both there and there was\na dramatic difference in file size.\n\n1572\n01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:51,690\nWhy is that?\n\n1573\n01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:54,920\nIf you've got to that point where you've\nfound two files that are like this and\n\n1574\n01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,811\nyou're suspicious, you probably already\nknow, you probably are gonna run\n\n1575\n01:25:57,811 --> 01:26:01,390\na steganalysis when you find that\nto see if anything shows up.\n\n1576\n01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,550\nNow some of these stegaanalysis\nprograms will encrypt,\n\n1577\n01:26:03,550 --> 01:26:06,300\ncompress and\nthen store inside something else\n\n1578\n01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:12,052\nin which case even if you found\nit you still have to decrypt it.\n\n1579\n01:26:12,052 --> 01:26:15,720\nBut there's lots of programs\nthat will do that for you.\n\n1580\n01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:19,090\nAnd just FYI, there's a lot of\npeople that are aware of this.\n\n1581\n01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:23,740\nThey actually caught,\nI think it was two years ago, they caught\n\n1582\n01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:33,060\nan Arab individual in\nGermany with a flash drive.\n\n1583\n01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:35,960\nThat had pornography on it.\n\n1584\n01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:40,300\nAnd they were saying this just\nlooked really suspicious.\n\n1585\n01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:45,590\nThe way it was going, the way things were,\nthere were some other things in there.\n\n1586\n01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:50,108\nAnd so what they did, is they found out\nthe guy did come from deep, and I believe\n\n1587\n01:26:50,108 --> 01:26:54,710\nin Afghanistan, and he was trying to\nrecruit people to be part of Al-Qaeda.\n\n1588\n01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:58,940\nAnd they knew that because when they\npulled the flash drive, they already\n\n1589\n01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,920\nwere getting them on some stuff anyway,\nbut when they looked at the flash drive,\n\n1590\n01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:07,800\nthey did steganalysis on it and actually\nextracted out of this pornographic video,\n\n1591\n01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:11,710\nthey extracted recruitment documents and\nplans about terrorist cell plans and\n\n1592\n01:27:11,710 --> 01:27:13,720\nstuff like that right out of it.\n\n1593\n01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:18,010\nYou can actually look that up if you\ntype in steganography and Al Qaeda,\n\n1594\n01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:19,810\nyou will find that.\n\n1595\n01:27:19,810 --> 01:27:22,500\nAnd it took them about eight months\nto find the stuff in that file.\n\n1596\n01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:24,270\nBut they were able to find it.\n\n1597\n01:27:24,270 --> 01:27:27,390\n>> And so, Philip, hopefully that answers\nyour questions or anything real time for\n\n1598\n01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:28,560\nemail or file uploads.\n\n1599\n01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,220\nAnd no, you've got to go through this\nanalysis of that file to look for\n\n1600\n01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,080\nthese bits that don't belong.\n\n1601\n01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:35,870\nAnd then try to put\nthose back together and\n\n1602\n01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:39,060\nsee if you can figure out what it\nis that's been hidden within that.\n\n1603\n01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:43,090\nSo I don't think there's any way that\nI know of that you can just say, oh.\n\n1604\n01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:43,980\nYou look at that file.\n\n1605\n01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:46,120\nAnd oh, that's got something hidden in it.\n\n1606\n01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,880\nUnless you've got both, like I said, and\nwhere you could compare, like you said,\n\n1607\n01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,990\nwhere you can compare them.\n\n1608\n01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:53,820\nSo as far as real time, somebody sends you\na file, and you get it, and you go, wait,\n\n1609\n01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,530\nhas that got something buried in it?\n\n1610\n01:27:55,530 --> 01:27:56,460\nYou really can't.\n\n1611\n01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,697\n>> And if you want, by the way, I've got\non my screen, if you want to do a little\n\n1612\n01:28:00,697 --> 01:28:05,880\nmore looking at steganography Something\nto, something specifically dedicate to it.\n\n1613\n01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:11,220\nThis is an article, an IBM using\nsteganography to avoid observation.\n\n1614\n01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:16,310\nIt's a its a pretty good short,\npretty good article on it.\n\n1615\n01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:17,110\n>> Nice.\n\n1616\n01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,937\n>> Because I wrote it.\n\n1617\n01:28:17,937 --> 01:28:20,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm not trying to plug anything.\n\n1618\n01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:24,110\nOh look, it's Sean Oriyano,\n[CROSSTALK] right there, I know that guy.\n\n1619\n01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:27,220\nBut in any case yeah I\nwrote this some time ago.\n\n1620\n01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:30,740\nAnd it is but\nit still holds up and discusses.\n\n1621\n01:28:30,740 --> 01:28:34,203\nIt's got links to some of\nthe technologies tha-,\n\n1622\n01:28:34,203 --> 01:28:37,920\nthat are allowed to do,\nthat can do steganography.\n\n1623\n01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,310\nSo if you're interested in it that's just\nanother way you could read up on that.\n\n1624\n01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:44,010\nAnd and see what's happening with it.\n\n1625\n01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:48,170\n>> All right ladies and gentlemen I know\nwe ran that one a little bit long, but\n\n1626\n01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:49,920\nthat was a lot of good information there.\n\n1627\n01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,750\nWhen we talk about covering tracks,\nand ADS, and steganography.\n\n1628\n01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:57,210\nAnything else we wanna hit\nbefore we wrap this one up?\n\n1629\n01:28:57,210 --> 01:28:59,690\n>> Yeah, there,\nthere looks like there might be a couple\n\n1630\n01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:02,280\nquestions in here that we\njust might wanna throw in.\n\n1631\n01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,750\nJust for our later viewers.\n\n1632\n01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:05,306\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1633\n01:29:05,306 --> 01:29:09,013\nIt says I see Patrick says, is the payload\ninert until it is decoded by someone who\n\n1634\n01:29:09,013 --> 01:29:11,160\nknows about the hidden information?\n\n1635\n01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,615\nYeah.\nIt's just bits until and, and\n\n1636\n01:29:13,615 --> 01:29:14,920\nsomeone does it.\n\n1637\n01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,380\nIt's harmless bits until someone you know,\nextracts it you know, out of there.\n\n1638\n01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,720\n>> So if I double click on the image,\nit's still going to open up.\n\n1639\n01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:26,160\nIf I double click on that MP3, it's still\ngoing to play, just like it always has.\n\n1640\n01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,600\nSo it doesn't affect the carrying file.\n\n1641\n01:29:29,832 --> 01:29:32,660\nAnd it's not gonna execute anything\nautomatically that's inside it by\n\n1642\n01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:34,920\ndouble clicking on that carrier file.\n\n1643\n01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:36,710\n>> Yeah and\nthere's also in here another one.\n\n1644\n01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:39,740\nIs there any visible defects noticeable\nin the image once it's encoded?\n\n1645\n01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:44,034\nYou know I think you know you know I\nthink Mike you mentioned that this Is,\n\n1646\n01:29:44,034 --> 01:29:48,620\nis there's a visual, actually a change\nin it you know because we're changing\n\n1647\n01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:52,808\nthose least significant bits in the image,\nfor example.\n\n1648\n01:29:52,808 --> 01:29:56,531\nThere's a change but the human eye isn't\ngoing to recognize the difference between\n\n1649\n01:29:56,531 --> 01:29:57,880\nwhite 255 and white 254.\n\n1650\n01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> You're just not going to see it.\n\n1651\n01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,040\n>> If, if were using four bit color\n>> Then that might cause a problem,\n\n1652\n01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,500\nwe start changing one of those bits.\n\n1653\n01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:09,120\nBut we're talking about 256 bit color,\nchanging that last bit, that least\n\n1654\n01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:13,690\nsignificant bit, isn't going to be a big\nenough change for the human eye to detect.\n\n1655\n01:30:13,690 --> 01:30:14,849\nSo\n>> Yeah,\n\n1656\n01:30:14,849 --> 01:30:18,150\nif you're not convinced, I see on here\nit says that you saw pictures on a page\n\n1657\n01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:22,460\nare noticeably different\n>> Go download Invisible Secrets, download\n\n1658\n01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:28,130\na pdf or something, and download an image,\nand shove the pdf inside an image.\n\n1659\n01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:32,350\nAnd save it under a different name and\njust flip back and forth between the two.\n\n1660\n01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:34,180\nYou will not see a change.\n\n1661\n01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,190\nYou just shouldn't.\n\n1662\n01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:41,550\nSo um,it's it's, it's that's just\nthe way the stuff is designed to work.\n\n1663\n01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:44,410\n>> And, and they might be doing that\nMichael mentioned the pictures as\n\n1664\n01:30:44,410 --> 01:30:47,510\nan example on that page,\nas a noticeable difference.\n\n1665\n01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:50,760\nIt very well could be that they're\ndoing that intentionally to draw you\n\n1666\n01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,700\nto the fact, but if it's done properly\nyou should not see a change in that.\n\n1667\n01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,650\n>> Yeah, it's very tough.\n\n1668\n01:30:56,650 --> 01:31:01,570\nAnd if you did it on an audio file it,\nit introduces a small echo into it.\n\n1669\n01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:05,830\nSo what you do is you\nhave the normal sound and\n\n1670\n01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:10,480\nyou have a small echo that's offset so\n\n1671\n01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:15,300\nsmall that the human ear can't detect\nit and if you ran it through analysis\n\n1672\n01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:19,855\nsoftware you're just, it, it would look\nlike it's little funky or whatever.\n\n1673\n01:31:19,855 --> 01:31:20,580\n>> Huh.\n\n1674\n01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:25,080\nMaybe you know maybe for\nit's a quality issue when it's recorded or\n\n1675\n01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:29,140\nwhatever, no ones gonna notice it.\n\n1676\n01:31:29,140 --> 01:31:32,110\n>> Right and then what do we got there.\n\n1677\n01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:35,130\nMichael, how much data can\nyou inject into a file?\n\n1678\n01:31:36,370 --> 01:31:37,740\nHowever much it will take.\n\n1679\n01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:43,210\nThe key thing being if you inject too\nmuch data into a carrier and that carrier\n\n1680\n01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:48,940\ngets bloated someones gonna look at it and\nsay, something's rotten in Denmark.\n\n1681\n01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:50,180\nAnd do a closer analysis.\n\n1682\n01:31:50,180 --> 01:31:54,750\nRemember you do not want people\nto do a closer analysis.\n\n1683\n01:31:54,750 --> 01:31:58,610\nSo, anything you can do to avoid\nthat is to your advantage.\n\n1684\n01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:04,910\nI don't want to see a small 800 by 600 you\nknow, j-peg that's you know, 400 megs.\n\n1685\n01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:08,130\nThat just does not exist.\n\n1686\n01:32:08,130 --> 01:32:11,920\nThere is no amount of information that\ncan make that happen; compressed or\n\n1687\n01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:13,060\nuncompressed, or whatever.\n\n1688\n01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,580\nYou can't do that.\n\n1689\n01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:17,000\nI'm going to look closer,\nbecause I know something's happening.\n\n1690\n01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,310\nThere's more there's more,\nthan is being seen there on the surface.\n\n1691\n01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:22,720\n>> Yep.\nExactly.\n\n1692\n01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:24,170\nSo.\n\n1693\n01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:25,180\nAll right.\nI'll tell you what.\n\n1694\n01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:28,360\nLike I said, I know we ran a little bit\nlong, so we need to wrap things up here.\n\n1695\n01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,820\nGood, great questions, guys and gals.\n\n1696\n01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:31,230\nDon't stop asking them.\n\n1697\n01:32:31,230 --> 01:32:32,980\n,but we're going to have\nto wrap this episode.\n\n1698\n01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:36,060\nAnd if you've got more questions\non the topic tune in for\n\n1699\n01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:40,680\nour next episode ask them live or go into\nour, our forums, post them there and\n\n1700\n01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,444\nwe'll make sure we get those answered so.\n\n1701\n01:32:43,444 --> 01:32:46,658\nI think we've pretty much covered\neverything as far as covering our tracks\n\n1702\n01:32:46,658 --> 01:32:49,973\nas well as getting through our system\naccess or gaining system access chapter\n\n1703\n01:32:49,973 --> 01:32:52,390\nanything we want to add,\njust to kind of wrap things up?\n\n1704\n01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:55,620\n>> No, not really.\n\n1705\n01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:58,580\nWe've covered quite a bit of ground,\nand like Mike said,\n\n1706\n01:32:58,580 --> 01:33:01,540\nyou guys asked a lot of great questions,\nhad a lot of curiosity.\n\n1707\n01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:06,130\nThat's personally what I like\nto see as an instructor and\n\n1708\n01:33:06,130 --> 01:33:09,150\nas a pen tester, I like to see that\ncuriosity and the exploration.\n\n1709\n01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:11,940\nSo pursue all the questions you're doing,\nand\n\n1710\n01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:14,850\ntry out steganography and\nalternate data streams.\n\n1711\n01:33:14,850 --> 01:33:16,180\nAbsolutely do that.\n\n1712\n01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:16,690\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1713\n01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:17,820\nWell, all right.\nSo\n\n1714\n01:33:17,820 --> 01:33:20,150\nin this episode we\ncovered a lot of ground.\n\n1715\n01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:23,790\nWe talked about, we started off\ntalking about cracking passwords.\n\n1716\n01:33:23,790 --> 01:33:26,960\nKey loggers we moved into, we talked\na little bit about privilege excal,\n\n1717\n01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,630\nI don't know if I can say that.\n\n1718\n01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:32,410\nPrivilege escalation where we tried\nto do our either our vertical or\n\n1719\n01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:34,420\nour horizontal escalation.\n\n1720\n01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:38,360\nRunning applications,\nall the way down into Covering tracks so\n\n1721\n01:33:38,360 --> 01:33:39,760\ngreat episode there.\n\n1722\n01:33:39,760

another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:40,401\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:42,320\nHow are you doing today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,415\n>> Doing great for\na Monday morning, how about you?\n\n7\n00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:46,275\n>> [LAUGH] As well as can be expected.\n\n8\n00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:49,685\nIf you're watching it live,\nwe're doing this on our Monday morning, so\n\n9\n00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:52,270\nafter a nice long,\nbeautiful weekend here in Florida.\n\n10\n00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,900\nWe are getting ready to dive back into\nour Certified Ethical Hacker episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,900\nSpecifically, today we're\ngonna be covering chapter\n\n12\n00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,260\neight if you're following along,\nwhich everybody should be at this point.\n\n13\n00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,950\nAnd that fantastic CEH,\nCertified Ethical Hacker,\n\n14\n00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:12,550\nversion 8 Study Guide, written by\nnone other than Mr Sean Oriyano.\n\n15\n00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:17,250\nSo we're in chapter 8 today, Sean,\nwhich is our viruses, Trojans,\n\n16\n00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,390\nworms, malware, spyware, adware.\n\n17\n00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,760\nAll that fun stuff, right?\n\n18\n00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,330\n>> Yeah, all the nastiness today.\n\n19\n00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,937\n>> All the nastiness, all right!\n\n20\n00:01:24,937 --> 00:01:29,061\nSo I have disconnected my computer from\nthe network just in case Sean tries to do\n\n21\n00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:30,256\nanything funny here.\n\n22\n00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,029\n>> [LAUGH] I'd better do that myself.\n\n23\n00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:33,266\n>> So, a good chapter here.\n\n24\n00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:37,147\nThis is the kind of stuff that\na lot of people are familiar with,\n\n25\n00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:40,530\nat least some of the basic\nconcepts of what malware is.\n\n26\n00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,610\nAnd we're gonna go over that anyway,\njust as a review, and\n\n27\n00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,600\nthen dive a little further into what\nthese guys are doing with this stuff and\n\n28\n00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,230\nhow they're trying to use it to attack\nour networks and attack our machines.\n\n29\n00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,680\nOr how we, as a Certified Ethical Hacker\n\n30\n00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,290\ncould maybe use this in pentest\ninformation, or to protect against it.\n\n31\n00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,120\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n32\n00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,820\nWhen we talk about this, I mean let's\njust kinda talk about what malware is.\n\n33\n00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,290\nGive you a little overview.\n\n34\n00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,230\n>> Yeah, cuz the terminology\ngets a little confusing,\n\n35\n00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:12,800\na little fuzzy with all the stuff we\nsee in the news and Facebook, all these\n\n36\n00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,220\nplaces where people are posting sensitive-\n>> Marketing and\n\n37\n00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,050\nall that stuff\n>> Yeah,\n\n38\n00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,455\na lot of hype gets associated\nwith some of these terms.\n\n39\n00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:22,374\nAnd so let's make sure we've got a good\nfoundational knowledge of what it are,\n\n40\n00:02:22,374 --> 00:02:27,540\nso malware in general,\nhow would you define malware?\n\n41\n00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,145\n>> Yeah, malware is one of those terms.\n\n42\n00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:31,870\nIt's an umbrella term is what it is.\n\n43\n00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,260\nIt's one of those terms that says\na lot without saying anything, really.\n\n44\n00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,560\nYou look at the term malware.\n\n45\n00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,850\nIt, by definition, means bad software.\n\n46\n00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,410\nIt's an amalgamation of those two terms.\n\n47\n00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,110\nSo what does that really mean?\n\n48\n00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,584\nWell, if I say bad software,\neveryone I'm sure is gonna have their\n\n49\n00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:54,387\nown opinion of what bad software is,\nbut we're not talking about that.\n\n50\n00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,456\n>> Bing?\n>> Yeah.\n\n51\n00:02:55,456 --> 00:03:01,220\n[LAUGH] Yeah, exactly.\n\n52\n00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,900\nMalware is an umbrella term that\ncovers things like viruses,\n\n53\n00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,480\nworms, Trojans,\njust a whole range of things.\n\n54\n00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,160\nIt's software that really\ndoesn't offer anything, but\n\n55\n00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,600\nat the same time it takes stuff or\ndoes something counter to what you want.\n\n56\n00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,880\nOr works against you, something like that.\n\n57\n00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,440\nThat's what we're really talking about.\n\n58\n00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,950\n>> So anything that really does\nsomething that I either didn't want or\n\n59\n00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,480\ndidn't need or didn't expect, right?\n\n60\n00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,740\n>> Exactly.\n>> Could be malware.\n\n61\n00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,840\nSo it could be malicious.\n\n62\n00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,780\nIt could be damaging.\n\n63\n00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,560\nBut it's definitely\nsomething that I don't want.\n\n64\n00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,240\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n65\n00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,570\nThat's the important thing about it.\n\n66\n00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:48,200\nIt's a big term, and as we're saying,\nmalware is used in a lot of places.\n\n67\n00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,770\nYou'll see malware used,\nyou'll see it used all over the internet.\n\n68\n00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,190\nYou'll see it used on software.\n\n69\n00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,090\nIf you go down to your local\ncomputer software store,\n\n70\n00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,760\nyou'll see stuff sitting\nthere saying anti malware.\n\n71\n00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,800\nYou hear it on TV shows and\nstuff like that.\n\n72\n00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,590\nMalware.\n\n73\n00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,615\nWhat the heck is that?\n\n74\n00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:12,630\nWell, it means you're talking about\nsoftware that is working against you.\n\n75\n00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,430\nThat's really what it is.\n\n76\n00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,960\nYou still have to kinda break it down\na bit more to really understand it.\n\n77\n00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,740\nAnd that's what we're gonna do here is\nwe're gonna try to break that down a bit\n\n78\n00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,280\nmore and get rid of some of that\nfuzziness that may exist about that term.\n\n79\n00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,800\n>> Right, right.\n\n80\n00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,740\nOkay.\n\n81\n00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,100\nSo we know malware is something typically\nthat I don't want on my system.\n\n82\n00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,310\nSo let's try to break it\ndown a little bit further.\n\n83\n00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,510\nAnd you just wanna go down our list or?\n\n84\n00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,870\n>> Yeah, let's take a quick look down\na list of, as a friend of mine put,\n\n85\n00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,325\nelectric transmitted diseases.\n\n86\n00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,300\n>> [LAUGH] Some ETDs.\n\n87\n00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,430\n>> Yeah, ETDs.\n\n88\n00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,554\nSo what we have here is\nwe have a whole bunch\n\n89\n00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:55,350\nof pieces of malware out there\nthat we're gonna break down.\n\n90\n00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,660\nWe've got viruses are one.\n\n91\n00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,821\nIn fact, it's one of the most\ncommon ones that people talk about.\n\n92\n00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:02,074\nYou have viruses.\n\n93\n00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:05,860\nThen you've got worms is another\none that comes out there.\n\n94\n00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,329\nThen there's Trojans, and\nthen they actually, interestingly enough,\n\n95\n00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:13,450\nthrow spyware in this category.\n\n96\n00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,980\nThey also throw adware in there too.\n\n97\n00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,537\nEven though we won't\nreally talk about adware.\n\n98\n00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:22,537\nThat's something that's not really\ntargeted towards what we do or\n\n99\n00:05:22,537 --> 00:05:27,550\nit's not really in the same ballpark,\nso we won't worry about it.\n\n100\n00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,210\nBut it is thrown in there.\n\n101\n00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,230\nThen we also have root kits, as well.\n\n102\n00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,310\nThose are all nasty pieces of software,\nsome nastier than others.\n\n103\n00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,646\nBut those are all under that\numbrella of malware, but\n\n104\n00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:44,610\neach do something specific and\ndo it a specific way.\n\n105\n00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,501\nAnd that, just to put it out there right\nup front, is that you need to be able to,\n\n106\n00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:53,516\nwhen you talk about each one of\nthese different types of malware,\n\n107\n00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:57,750\nyou need to distinguish why that\none merits its own category name.\n\n108\n00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,295\nWhy a virus is a virus and\nwhy a virus is different than a worm.\n\n109\n00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,838\nYou need to be able to do\nthat by the time we're done.\n\n110\n00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:08,570\n>> Mm-hm, I never had any\nluck phishing with viruses.\n\n111\n00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,878\n>> Yeah, yeah exactly.\n\n112\n00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:12,961\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n113\n00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:14,976\nwe've got a bunch of different\ncategories then, and\n\n114\n00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:17,190\nwe really need to be able to\nunderstand what makes a virus.\n\n115\n00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,140\nWhat makes a worm?\n\n116\n00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,230\nWhat makes a Trojan?\n\n117\n00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,120\nAnd there are some gray areas, right?\n\n118\n00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,440\nI know some of these things might ride\nthe fence on these different categories.\n\n119\n00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,390\nBut in general, we've got some definitions\nI guess, I won't say rules, but\n\n120\n00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,130\nsome rules to the categories\nof what makes a virus,\n\n121\n00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,740\nwhat makes a worm, and a Trojan,\nand a rootkit, things like that.\n\n122\n00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,660\nSo that's what we need to know for\nthis exam.\n\n123\n00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,700\nSo let's start with the first one,\n\n124\n00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,770\nthe one that everybody's probably at\nleast familiar with the term of virus.\n\n125\n00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,810\nAnd it's probably one of\nthose overused terms.\n\n126\n00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,583\nI think just about, like to my father,\neverything is a virus, right?\n\n127\n00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,320\n>> Absolutely.\n>> I mean, it doesn't matter.\n\n128\n00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,730\nIf he gets a thing in email that\nhe didn't ask for, that's a virus.\n\n129\n00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,440\nIt doesn't really matter what he gets,\nit's all a virus.\n\n130\n00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,660\nBut that's not true, right?\n\n131\n00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,880\nNot everything is a virus.\n\n132\n00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,130\n>> No, definitely not.\n\n133\n00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,250\nA virus is, and a worm,\njust to kind of throw that in there, too.\n\n134\n00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,570\nBut we'll stick with viruses first.\n\n135\n00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,815\nThat term is very, very overused, and\nit's quite frequently used incorrectly.\n\n136\n00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:15,510\nAnything bad that happens on\na system is automatically a virus,\n\n137\n00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,820\nand that's not true.\n\n138\n00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,650\nSome of it could be user error,\nbut once we eliminate those,\n\n139\n00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,860\nnot every piece of malware that\ngets on a system is a virus.\n\n140\n00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,025\nThere are things that are malware\nthat are not viruses,\n\n141\n00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:30,220\nas we've already kind of discussed.\n\n142\n00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,920\nYou know so what we kinda wanna get\ninto is why a virus is a virus and\n\n143\n00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,920\nwhy it's not thrown into one\nof the other categories.\n\n144\n00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,980\nFor something to be\ncategorized as a virus,\n\n145\n00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:45,360\nit has to be something that's really,\nit has a host.\n\n146\n00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,460\nIt invades that host.\n\n147\n00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,670\nAnd relies on something to happen\nto get it to start its infection.\n\n148\n00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,880\nThat's really what it is.\n\n149\n00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,000\nAnd that really distinguishes\nit from other things.\n\n150\n00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,920\nIs that if you have something\nthat's infected by a virus.\n\n151\n00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,946\nYou start that application or\nstart whatever it is and\n\n152\n00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:11,680\nthat triggers the actual infection\nto take place at that point.\n\n153\n00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,830\n>> Yeah, and I always think of viruses\nas needing our help to reproduce.\n\n154\n00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,700\nThey're typically attached to a file or\n\n155\n00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,830\nsome type of document, and what happens\nis when you click on that file or\n\n156\n00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,730\nthat document that's infected,\nthat virus can then load up into memory.\n\n157\n00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,140\nAnd can try to attach itself\nto other documents or\n\n158\n00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,660\nother things you're working with.\n\n159\n00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,720\nBecause all of that resides\nin your RAM at that point.\n\n160\n00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,090\nAnd then when you save something and email\nit to somebody else, and you save it, and\n\n161\n00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,655\nnow it's got a copy of that Virus with it.\n\n162\n00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,755\nYou email it to somebody else,\nthey open up that file,\n\n163\n00:08:44,755 --> 00:08:46,395\nit now resides in their memory.\n\n164\n00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,595\nAnd it starts infecting\neverything in their memory.\n\n165\n00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,375\nThey start sharing files and\nthings like that and it starts spreading.\n\n166\n00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:54,385\nBut if you wouldn't have opened\nup that file in the first place,\n\n167\n00:08:54,385 --> 00:08:56,265\nthat virus might not have\nbeen able to reproduce.\n\n168\n00:08:56,265 --> 00:08:57,135\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n169\n00:08:57,135 --> 00:08:59,215\nAnd you hit the nail on the head.\n\n170\n00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,405\nI use the more generic term on it.\n\n171\n00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:06,410\nBut yeah, you're absolutely right\nto put in crystal terms in there.\n\n172\n00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,730\nRemember, a virus needs a host.\n\n173\n00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n174\n00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,475\n>> It needs a host to\nstart all its nastiness.\n\n175\n00:09:12,475 --> 00:09:14,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, now what that host is,\n\n176\n00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,170\nit could be an application file,\nwhich a lot of times it is.\n\n177\n00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,140\nIt can be some other stuff too.\n\n178\n00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,800\nBut once they're there,\nthey need something to really\n\n179\n00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,710\nset them off to make them go ahead and\ndo their nastiness.\n\n180\n00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,230\nAnd that's why there's so\nmany different types of viruses out there.\n\n181\n00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,640\nThat's the other thing on it as well,\n\n182\n00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,480\nis that there's not just one type of virus\nthere's a whole family tree of viruses.\n\n183\n00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,700\nEach one having its own\ncharacteristics and\n\n184\n00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,600\nbehavior that you really\nneed to be aware of.\n\n185\n00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:49,050\nIt's actually quite amazing when you start\nlooking at the whole taxonomy of viruses.\n\n186\n00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,900\n>> It's a good way to put it,\nI like that, taxonomy.\n\n187\n00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:56,328\nThey call them viruses,\nthey use the term taxonomy, and\n\n188\n00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:59,756\nit is similar to looking\nat an evolution tree.\n\n189\n00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:02,607\nThe way these viruses\nevolved over time and\n\n190\n00:10:02,607 --> 00:10:06,170\nhave added new functionality and\nnew capabilities,\n\n191\n00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,460\nand you hate to say it, but some of\nthem are very elegant and impressive.\n\n192\n00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,090\nI hate to say that I'm impressed\nby some of these malware, but\n\n193\n00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,900\nthe way it works,\nthe coders were ingenious.\n\n194\n00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,525\n>> Yes, some of these guys are just\nbrilliant when you look at them.\n\n195\n00:10:20,525 --> 00:10:23,896\nThey have their own beauty about\nthem that these people have created.\n\n196\n00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:28,130\nYou look back at some early ones, the\nfirst viruses depending on who you ask,\n\n197\n00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,555\nit was late 60s early 70s before\nthey even have the term virus.\n\n198\n00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,830\nThose were created for research purposes.\n\n199\n00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,820\nBut they still had some of the\ncharacteristics of stuff we see nowadays.\n\n200\n00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,710\nIt wasn't until the 80s that we\nstarted seeing the first generation of\n\n201\n00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,450\nthings that were called viruses.\n\n202\n00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,150\nI believe it was 81, 82,\nwith the Apple computers,\n\n203\n00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,850\nwhich were the dominant computing platform\nat the time, that the public had.\n\n204\n00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,890\nAnd those ones, for the most part,\nwere used as pranks, and stuff like that.\n\n205\n00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:03,600\nBut things started stepping up their\ngame with the ones that came after that.\n\n206\n00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,000\nSome of the ones we saw that went\nfrom just being an executable,\n\n207\n00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,120\nthat you ran and infected something,\nnext ones we saw were\n\n208\n00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,280\nones that started being able to alter\nlike the boot sector of a drive.\n\n209\n00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,590\nYou had boot sector viruses often\nsometimes called shell viruses.\n\n210\n00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,520\nWhat they would do is go to\nthe master boot record of the drive\n\n211\n00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,330\nwhich is on the first sector of the hard\ndrive and it would slide it over and\n\n212\n00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,930\ninsert itself in there.\n\n213\n00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:31,400\nSo every time you turn the computer\non it would actually come in and\n\n214\n00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,680\nrun that virus first and\nthen run the master boot record.\n\n215\n00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,400\nAnd so, that was a significant\nchange of what we had in the past.\n\n216\n00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,750\nThose of us who have\nbeen around long enough,\n\n217\n00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,610\nprobably some of our first\nfrustrations we had with viruses.\n\n218\n00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,520\nWhen you look at a boot sector one,\nsince that represented a big departure.\n\n219\n00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,450\nBefore that, we had to get rid of a virus\non the system, we just went out and\n\n220\n00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,750\nfound it, deleted it or whatever or let\nour antivirus take it out if we had one.\n\n221\n00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,260\nThey were still very new.\n\n222\n00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,370\nAnd that was it.\n\n223\n00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,510\nThose ones if you tried to get rid of the\nvirus what would happen is, you get rid\n\n224\n00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:13,680\nof the virus off the main part of the\ndrive then you'd restart the computer and\n\n225\n00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,790\nit would re-hit that [LAUGH] boot sector,\nrerun the virus and\n\n226\n00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,360\nthen go ahead and\nkeep the infection going again.\n\n227\n00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,580\nSo every time you restarted the computer\nyou think you had it eliminated.\n\n228\n00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,380\nYou start the computer, it's reinfected,\nand you'd want to throw the thing out\n\n229\n00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,161\nthe window until you found out\nthat was the secret there.\n\n230\n00:12:31,161 --> 00:12:32,191\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n231\n00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:35,730\n>> And that was just kind of\ntheir first major change they did\n\n232\n00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,825\nfrom the time they invented it.\n\n233\n00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,280\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n234\n00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,730\nYeah, and I think we had a question\nthere in the chat room talking about,\n\n235\n00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,950\nis there a specific\ntaxonomy we should look at?\n\n236\n00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,480\nAnd we kind of use that term, now I don't\nthink that there's a specific taxonomy,\n\n237\n00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200\nbut there are several\ngoes over in his book.\n\n238\n00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,290\nDifferent classifications, and\nwe'll talk about them in a little bit,\n\n239\n00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,990\nthat you need to be familiar with for\nthe exam.\n\n240\n00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,260\n>> Yeah, there definitely is\nnot just one type of virus.\n\n241\n00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,986\nI just gave you a peek by telling\nyou about the boot sector\n\n242\n00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:07,423\nvirus that represents one\nmajor change in viruses.\n\n243\n00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:10,340\nYeah, there are other\nchanges that came after that.\n\n244\n00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,639\nAnd there's so many different branches in\nthe family tree nowadays, so it really\n\n245\n00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,063\nkind of just depends on which one you run\ninto, and that's why they have researchers\n\n246\n00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:23,250\nlooking into this stuff, because\nthey're taken so many different paths.\n\n247\n00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,150\nThere are some major types but\n\n248\n00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,050\nthen there are some variations of\nthose which make things really nasty.\n\n249\n00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,520\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n250\n00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,740\nOkay, so viruses, we'll go back into a\nlittle more detail in a little bit, Sean.\n\n251\n00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,958\nBut, for now, so we got viruses,\none type of malware.\n\n252\n00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,660\nThat really relies on the user to\nhelp that thing spread as Sean says,\n\n253\n00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,910\nit needs a host, could be a file,\nan application, a floppy disc, a USB.\n\n254\n00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,280\nIt needs something and\nwe typically have to run it or\n\n255\n00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,060\nexecute it or open up the infected\nfile to help that virus spread.\n\n256\n00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:02,250\nAnother category that we wanna make\nsure were familiar with, would be worms.\n\n257\n00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:02,880\nRight.\n>> Yeah,\n\n258\n00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,440\nworms are another very interesting type.\n\n259\n00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:12,634\nOne that very typically gets wounds\nup in its predecessor viruses.\n\n260\n00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,882\nYou saw worms come out.\n\n261\n00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:19,818\nWorms definitely weren't the second\ntype of malware that came out, so\n\n262\n00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,132\nwe want to be careful about that.\n\n263\n00:14:22,132 --> 00:14:25,500\nActually Trojans appeared\nin-between these two.\n\n264\n00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,560\nBut worms represent a significant shift.\n\n265\n00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:36,200\nFirst worms kind of debuted in the late\n90s or late 80s if you can believe that.\n\n266\n00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,820\nAnd they were so\ndangerous when they came out,\n\n267\n00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,490\nwhen the first one that was\nclassified as a worm came out.\n\n268\n00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,300\nIt actually shut down\nthe Internet at the time.\n\n269\n00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The only time I can ever\n\n270\n00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,650\nremember hearing that term happening\nthat literally means that.\n\n271\n00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,200\nWhen they said they shut it down,\nit shut it down.\n\n272\n00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,800\n>> Yeah, we hear that all the time\nabout the Internet is down.\n\n273\n00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,790\nAnd typically it's not the Internet right,\nit's your connectivity to the Internet, or\n\n274\n00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,550\nsomething like that.\n\n275\n00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,830\nBut in this case, they weren't lying.\n\n276\n00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,700\nThey weren't exaggerating.\n\n277\n00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,680\nThe Internet was down.\n\n278\n00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,660\n>> Yeah, it really did.\n\n279\n00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,880\nIt shut the Internet down.\n\n280\n00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,310\nThey had to go section by section on\nthe Internet and disinfect stuff.\n\n281\n00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,760\nThey had to compartmentalize it,\n\n282\n00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,000\ndisinfect it, and\nthen move onto the next one to remove it.\n\n283\n00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,410\nBecause it was so aggressive.\n\n284\n00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,710\nNow a days that probably\nisn't gonna happen, but\n\n285\n00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:29,220\nthe time the Internet was much smaller,\nit still was a significant\n\n286\n00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,450\nfeat to undertake that somebody\nwas able to accomplish that.\n\n287\n00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,680\nSo, and it wasn't even that aggressive,\nreally.\n\n288\n00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,470\nThe creator of it had actually throttled\nit back so it wasn't that aggressive.\n\n289\n00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,510\nAnd it's still accomplished that\ntask of taking out the Internet.\n\n290\n00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,630\nYeah, he went to prison over it.\n\n291\n00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,434\nAnyway, if we start seeing,\nmost people don't hear about that one\n\n292\n00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:55,000\nbecause that was before most\npeople got on the Internet proper.\n\n293\n00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,462\nThe ones we started seeing\nwere stuff like I love you and\n\n294\n00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,880\nthings like that started coming out.\n\n295\n00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,388\nAnd they showed us just how\nvulnerable things are with worms and\n\n296\n00:16:05,388 --> 00:16:08,420\njust how vicious worms can be.\n\n297\n00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,970\nWhat separates worms from viruses is,\nviruses really need that host.\n\n298\n00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,130\nThey need something from you to start\ntriggering off that whole thing.\n\n299\n00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,730\nI can start sending them out, but\n\n300\n00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,280\ntakes something from you to\ncause them to start going.\n\n301\n00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,460\nA worm, you just need to be in the way and\nvulnerable.\n\n302\n00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,370\nThat's it.\n\n303\n00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,890\nIf you happen to be in the way, and\nyou're vulnerable it's gonna get you.\n\n304\n00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,900\nIt doesn't require any input from you.\n\n305\n00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,630\nIt'll go on your system, use your\nresources and whatever it needs to,\n\n306\n00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,440\nto go ahead and make copies of itself, and\ndo its nastiness and then just move on.\n\n307\n00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,120\nAnd it can do that so fast, and\nnot just because it's code,\n\n308\n00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,280\nbecause it doesn't require any input\nfrom you, it can spread so fast that...\n\n309\n00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,030\nYou know, it's mind numbing.\n\n310\n00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,270\nI mean,\nI don't even know another way to put it.\n\n311\n00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,570\n>> I mean, it is to the point where\nit's really hard to fathom how fast.\n\n312\n00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,990\nWe'll talk later on about\nsome specific worms.\n\n313\n00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,930\nSome specific numbers.\n\n314\n00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,940\nAnd how fast they spread but,\nit's mind boggling and\n\n315\n00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,890\nit can shut a network down in a heartbeat\nbecause, as you said, the big\n\n316\n00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,500\ndifference I think with the viruses and\nworms, worms don't need our help.\n\n317\n00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,750\nThey're standalone.\n\n318\n00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,180\nThey're not really attached to a file or\na host or anything like that.\n\n319\n00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,640\nAnd they don't need our help to replicate,\n\n320\n00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,840\nso as you said, they can just take\nall the resources I've got and\n\n321\n00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,960\nreplicate like rabbits, and\nmove on to any other vulnerable host.\n\n322\n00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,550\nAnd it's like in nature.\n\n323\n00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,840\nThey told two friends, and they told two\nfriends, and they told two friends, and\n\n324\n00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,440\nso on and so on.\n\n325\n00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,590\nAnd it starts getting this\nexponential growth rate.\n\n326\n00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,480\nAnd it does not take long to bring\na network down with a well written worm.\n\n327\n00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,800\nBut again the big difference right now for\n\n328\n00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,460\nhigh level overview,\nthe worm doesn't really need our help.\n\n329\n00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,745\nThe worm, once that thing gets released,\nIt can do pretty much,\n\n330\n00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:50,755\nit does it's own replication\nwithout interaction.\n\n331\n00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:53,115\n>> Yeah, David mentions Code Red.\n\n332\n00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,915\nCode Red, that one, it was one of\nthe ones that was a really good example,\n\n333\n00:17:56,915 --> 00:18:01,012\nas Code Red spread across the internet and\n\n334\n00:18:01,012 --> 00:18:03,882\ncovered the whole planet\nin about three hours.\n\n335\n00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:05,162\n>> Yeah, isn't that amazing?\n\n336\n00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:09,262\nThe only spots you did not have that were\ninfected were like the Sahara Desert,\n\n337\n00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:12,052\nAntarctica didn't have\ntoo many red spots on it.\n\n338\n00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,332\nBut other than that, anywhere.\n\n339\n00:18:13,332 --> 00:18:16,952\nIt was just amazing at\nhow fast it came down.\n\n340\n00:18:16,952 --> 00:18:18,732\n>> Yeah,\nif you looked at a map at the time and\n\n341\n00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:23,975\nsaw those little red dots all over it\n>> It looked like a teenager before prom.\n\n342\n00:18:23,975 --> 00:18:24,475\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It did.\n\n343\n00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:25,995\nIt was like pop, pop, pop, pop.\n\n344\n00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:27,360\nIt was just bad.\n\n345\n00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:27,950\n>> Nice.\n\n346\n00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,640\n>> It was all over the place.\n\n347\n00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,331\nIf you ever get a chance to look up\nsome of the research on that one,\n\n348\n00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:40,235\nwhich is out there,\nyou'll see that it was crazy fast.\n\n349\n00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,600\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n350\n00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,530\nAnd we'll pull up some of\nthat when we get into our\n\n351\n00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,060\nIn our next segment we might pull up\nsome of those maps and show you guys.\n\n352\n00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,100\nWe'll talk about how fast\nthat thing replicated.\n\n353\n00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,630\nI remember fighting,\nSQL Slammer was another one that I\n\n354\n00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,890\nremember dealing with a lot\n,and having to battle.\n\n355\n00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,280\nSo we've got our viruses which\nneed our help to spread.\n\n356\n00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,430\nThey need a host.\n\n357\n00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,797\nWe've got worms which are standalone, and\nthese guys can replicate on their own.\n\n358\n00:19:05,797 --> 00:19:10,690\nAnother category that we're gonna talk a\nlittle bit more about will be our Trojans.\n\n359\n00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,506\n>> Trojans are one of those ones that\nI dont think gets the amount of love\n\n360\n00:19:15,506 --> 00:19:19,743\nthat it used to, but\nthere are definitely still out there.\n\n361\n00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:24,060\nA Trojan is, in a lot of cases,\nit's gonna sound like a virus.\n\n362\n00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,100\nYou're definitely gonna look at it and\ngo, that's a virus.\n\n363\n00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,700\nAnd, like I said,\nit matches it pretty closely, except for\n\n364\n00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,780\none really key difference\nthat's important.\n\n365\n00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,330\nA Trojan relies on social engineering\ntechniques where a virus does not.\n\n366\n00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,460\nA Trojan, what it's going to do, the way\nI'm going to effect you with a Trojan,\n\n367\n00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,710\nis I'm going to take my nastiness and\n\n368\n00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:48,690\nshove it inside of something that\nI think that you're gonna want.\n\n369\n00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,670\nAnd by doing that, you'll go out there and\ndouble click on it, and then when you\n\n370\n00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,930\ndouble click on this, and run this thing,\nYou think you're getting this nice game or\n\n371\n00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,830\napplication or what have you, and\nmeanwhile while you're seeing that\n\n372\n00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,590\nthing that you wanted show up,\nin the background,\n\n373\n00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,740\nmy Trojan is installing itself on your\nsystem or doing you know, whatever.\n\n374\n00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,580\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n375\n00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,850\nSo the Trojan, the big difference is,\nand it might be.\n\n376\n00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,930\nDifferent types of malware inside there,\nbut\n\n377\n00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,660\nit's really more of a delivery mechanism,\nright?\n\n378\n00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,050\nIt's a way to get that malware delivered.\n\n379\n00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,120\nThat's my favorite way to describe this.\n\n380\n00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,890\nIt looks like something you want, turns\nout to be something that you didn't want.\n\n381\n00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,630\nAnd we all know the story of\nthe Greeks and the Trojans.\n\n382\n00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,750\nSo you're just sugar-coating it.\n\n383\n00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,690\nYou're wrapping it up inside something.\n\n384\n00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,547\nSomething that's gonna tempt them to\nclick on it, or to execute it, or\n\n385\n00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:39,976\nwhatever it is, and\nit might even do what it's supposed to do.\n\n386\n00:20:39,976 --> 00:20:42,685\nLike I always thought\na free game of Tetris, and\n\n387\n00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:45,475\nwho could resist a free game of Tetris,\ncome on.\n\n388\n00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:45,975\n>> Who couldn't?\n\n389\n00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:47,040\nCome on.\n\n390\n00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,245\n>> You wrap that thing up in there,\nand somebody's gonna click on it, and\n\n391\n00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:54,108\nin the background, it's calling home or\ndoing whatever it is so,\n\n392\n00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:57,920\nTrojans are interesting.\n\n393\n00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,670\nAnd we got a term that we probably\nwant to throw in there with Trojans\n\n394\n00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,270\nif we want to hit that yet or?\n\n395\n00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,900\n>> Yeah let's go ahead and throw that in.\n\n396\n00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,230\nThere's a term called covert\nchannels that is always mentioned\n\n397\n00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,860\nthe same breath as Trojans.\n\n398\n00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,170\nA covert channel is basically any system\n\n399\n00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,880\ncounter to the way it\nwas intended to be used.\n\n400\n00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,740\nSo there's plenty of ways to do that.\n\n401\n00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,710\nThe easiest one that we've seen in here,\nif you were with us for all the lessons so\n\n402\n00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,940\nfar, or you're going back and\nreviewing them.\n\n403\n00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,400\nOne of the ones that we had is, and\n\n404\n00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,140\nwhen we look at,\nwe have to go back to steganography.\n\n405\n00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,380\nSteganography if you look at it, one of\nthe things we did in there is we took\n\n406\n00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:39,690\nan image and we talked about shoving\na PDF or whatever else inside of it.\n\n407\n00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,580\nWell, I can assure you, no one ever\nlooked at a jpg as being something\n\n408\n00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,290\nother than a way to convey\nvisual information.\n\n409\n00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,730\nBut here we are, and\n\n410\n00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,930\nwe're shoving something else inside\nof it that can be extracted later on.\n\n411\n00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,680\nSo, it's definitely a prime\nexample of a covert channel,\n\n412\n00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,680\nwhere it wasn't supposed to be used\nthat way, but we are using it that way.\n\n413\n00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,530\nAnd, covert channels have the benefit of,\nonce you use something that way.\n\n414\n00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,207\nNo one's really looking for it.\n\n415\n00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:08,463\nThey're not right out,\n\n416\n00:22:08,463 --> 00:22:14,390\nas normal course looking for\nwhatever it is.\n\n417\n00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,130\n>> So a covert channel,is\nbasically misusing something or\n\n418\n00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,620\nreappropriating it to a different purpose.\n\n419\n00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,490\nLike we all know ping packets are used to\ntest electrical connectivity between two\n\n420\n00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,200\nhosts or two nodes, but a ping packet\nactually has pay load capabilities.\n\n421\n00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,550\nAnd I can deliver information\nwith a ping packet,\n\n422\n00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,780\nnot what it was designed to do,\nbut it's possible.\n\n423\n00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:38,210\nSo that'd be an example of\ndoing a covert channel.\n\n424\n00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,310\n>> Yeah, thanks for bringing that one up,\n\n425\n00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,800\nbecause that's another\nreally good example.\n\n426\n00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:47,210\nYes, you can use a ping packet to\nsend information into a system and\n\n427\n00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,490\nhave it processed over on the other side.\n\n428\n00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,555\nAnd it's not something that you\ntypically associate with that because\n\n429\n00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:56,070\na ping is associated with one thing and\nthat's to test productivity.\n\n430\n00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,380\nIt's not associated with being a delivery\nmechanism even though that's there.\n\n431\n00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,790\nExactly.\nSo I might allow those ping packets\n\n432\n00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,950\nthinking, well what harm can\ncome from a ping packet?\n\n433\n00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,900\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n434\n00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,313\n>> Chuckle, chuckle, right?\n\n435\n00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:08,871\n[LAUGH]\n\n436\n00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:09,760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n437\n00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,600\nSo we got Trojans, which kind of can goes,\nthe covert channels in there.\n\n438\n00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,020\nAnother one that we're probably all\nfamiliar with, unfortunately, spyware.\n\n439\n00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,840\nYeah, spyware is another one that\nis a term that's used a lot, and\n\n440\n00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,640\nmaybe used incorrectly, so we're gonna\nkind of straighten that out here.\n\n441\n00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,750\nSpyware is gonna be broadly defined as\nanything that can get on your system that\n\n442\n00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,210\ncan sit there and\nsilently observe what you're doing.\n\n443\n00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,030\nIt can be a whole ton of\nthings it could be observing.\n\n444\n00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:44,006\nIt could be anywhere from a keylogger,\n\n445\n00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:49,880\nto something that's monitoring your\ninternet activities to what have you.\n\n446\n00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,552\nBut as long as it's something that gets in\nyour system and can quietly monitor what\n\n447\n00:23:54,552 --> 00:23:58,630\nyou do and not give away its presence,\nit fits the category of spyware.\n\n448\n00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:03,060\nYeah, so I think that's where the big\nmisuse of that term comes in,\n\n449\n00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,790\ntypically with spyware.\n\n450\n00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,210\nIt doesn't do anything malicious.\n\n451\n00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,690\nI hate to say non-malicious cuz if\nit's sending my key strokes and\n\n452\n00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:12,210\nmy passwords to somebody else,\nthat's damn sure malicious.\n\n453\n00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,220\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n454\n00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,140\n>> But what I mean by that is it's not\nperforming any activities on your system\n\n455\n00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,020\nother then just like you said, being\nquiet and monitoring and spying, right?\n\n456\n00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,200\nI mean that's the name.\n\n457\n00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,430\nIt says spyware.\n\n458\n00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:28,780\nSo it's spying on you, weather your taking\nscreen shots or keystrokes, or log files,\n\n459\n00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,407\nor websites you visited, and all of\nthat stuff, and then even eventually,\n\n460\n00:24:33,407 --> 00:24:37,704\nsaving that information, or\nsomehow reporting it back to somebody.\n\n461\n00:24:37,704 --> 00:24:40,440\n>> Yeah exactly, that's what spyware does.\n\n462\n00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,010\n>> And that's the one I think\neveryone gets confused.\n\n463\n00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,430\nMore often than not they get spyware\non their machine, they say hey,\n\n464\n00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,640\nI've got a virus.\n\n465\n00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,090\nNo you don't, you've got spyware.\n\n466\n00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,653\nAnd there's a big difference of\nhow we're gonna handle that, but\n\n467\n00:24:52,653 --> 00:24:53,537\nit gets misused a lot.\n\n468\n00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:54,860\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n469\n00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:02,320\n>> All right, so we've got spyware,\nwhich everybody enjoys, I know.\n\n470\n00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,160\nThese, I'll tell you what,\nthese ones right here.\n\n471\n00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,360\n>> [LAUGH] Drum roll please.\n\n472\n00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,540\n>> [LAUGH] I know right.\n\n473\n00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,315\nDrum roll please.\n\n474\n00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:12,400\n[LAUGH] Rootkits is one of the last\nones we talked about there.\n\n475\n00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,590\nRootkits are some nasty,\nnasty little things, aren't they?\n\n476\n00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,780\n>> Yeah, rootkits are probably\nthe nastiest thing, you'll run into,\n\n477\n00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,370\nif you run into them.\n\n478\n00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,310\nRootkits have the distinction of\nbeing one of the most powerful\n\n479\n00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:27,590\nforms of malware you're gonna run into,\nif not the most powerful malware, or\n\n480\n00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,700\nhave the potential to be.\n\n481\n00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,110\nThere's not just one type of rootkit,\nas we'll learn.\n\n482\n00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,040\nBut rootkits, they could actually change\nthe whole behavior of an operating system.\n\n483\n00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:43,170\nThe best way to look at it is, is kind\nof like that Matrix thing, the red pill,\n\n484\n00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:48,600\nblue pill type thing is, you can actually\ntell that system whatever you wanted to,\n\n485\n00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,040\nand that system will take it as real.\n\n486\n00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:56,720\nThat system, for example, could have\nan antivirus scanner on there looking for\n\n487\n00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,860\nviruses and all that nastiness.\n\n488\n00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,786\nA rootkit could get in there and alter\nthe system, so whenever the antivirus goes\n\n489\n00:26:02,786 --> 00:26:06,711\nlooking for something, it could be looking\nright at it, and that bad stuff, and\n\n490\n00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,433\nthe rootkit will step in there, saying no,\nthat's not what you see at all.\n\n491\n00:26:10,433 --> 00:26:12,595\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it will report back going, yeah,\n\n492\n00:26:12,595 --> 00:26:13,840\nthis thing is clean.\n\n493\n00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,110\nAll quiet on the Western front.\n\n494\n00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,750\nRight?\n\n495\n00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,570\nGo out, and say that, and we're done.\n\n496\n00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,840\nSo they can be very, very, very nasty.\n\n497\n00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,920\nAnd they, like I said they come in\nseveral different shades so to speak.\n\n498\n00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,870\n>> I like that.\nThis is so\n\n499\n00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,195\nnot the virus you're looking for.\n\n500\n00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n501\n00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,340\n>> But it does it really hides.\n\n502\n00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,070\nAnd we'll talk about how it does this,\nbut it gets way down in my system.\n\n503\n00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,280\nAnd all my tools that\nnormally report status and\n\n504\n00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,990\nthings like that might not be reporting\nwhat actually is going on with my system,\n\n505\n00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,420\nbecause it's able to grab those hooks,\nis be able to get in to those hooks and\n\n506\n00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:51,210\nreport back false information\nto completely hide itself.\n\n507\n00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:55,840\nAmazing stuff, but nasty, nasty and\nnear impossible to get rid of.\n\n508\n00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,520\nI mean, it's no bueno.\n\n509\n00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,920\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n510\n00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,670\n>> All right.\n\n511\n00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,120\nSo a lot of different categories then.\n\n512\n00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,330\nWe got viruses,\nwe'll be talking about malware.\n\n513\n00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,100\nMalware being an umbrella term, as Sean\nsaid, that kind of covers all of it.\n\n514\n00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,720\nAnd then we're gonna break it down.\n\n515\n00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,070\nWithin malware, we've got viruses,\nwe've got worms, we've go trojans, and\n\n516\n00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,890\nwe've got spyware, and we've got rootkits.\n\n517\n00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:19,530\nSo a lot of different categories, and\n\n518\n00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:24,260\nI think as we talked about adware and\nadware doesn't really fit into this.\n\n519\n00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,470\nI mean, in some respects it could be\nused to maybe gain some information\n\n520\n00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:31,090\non somebody, but-\n>> Yeah another time and\n\n521\n00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,090\nplace would be for that one.\n\n522\n00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,732\n>> Well save that one for later.\n\n523\n00:27:33,732 --> 00:27:35,984\n>> All right, well, good deal.\n\n524\n00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:38,722\nWe did a good job of classifying\nour different malware.\n\n525\n00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:42,120\nLooking at the clock,\nwe're about ready to take our break.\n\n526\n00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,170\nSo rather than dive into our first\ncategory there, let's go ahead and\n\n527\n00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:45,750\ntake our break.\n\n528\n00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,415\nWhen we come back, more about viruses and\nworms, so stay tuned.\n\n529\n00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:52,261\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n530\n00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:58,152\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n531\n00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:01,321\nSo, we left off talking about\nthe different categories of malware.\n\n532\n00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:03,243\nNow we're gonna kind of, go back and\n\n533\n00:28:03,243 --> 00:28:07,335\ntake a look at a little more in-depth\nlook at each one of those categories, and\n\n534\n00:28:07,335 --> 00:28:11,800\nmaybe some examples of some things that we\nmight find in those different categories.\n\n535\n00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,500\nAnd starting with everybody's favorite,\nviruses.\n\n536\n00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,530\nLet's talk about some viruses.\n\n537\n00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:17,630\nLots of different categories, right?\n\n538\n00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,176\nLots of different types.\n\n539\n00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,323\nAs you were saying,\nearlier in our episode,\n\n540\n00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,080\na lot of different types of viruses.\n\n541\n00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,610\nNot a single thing, right?\n\n542\n00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n543\n00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:30,140\nViruses cannot be considered\nto be one specific entity.\n\n544\n00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,500\nIt's kind of like in the real\nworld the medical side of things,\n\n545\n00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,410\nthere's not just one type of viruses,\nthere's multiple types in there.\n\n546\n00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,698\nIf you're familiar with that.\n\n547\n00:28:38,698 --> 00:28:44,187\nBut the thing is that for us you need\nto know some of the different types to\n\n548\n00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:50,609\nunderstand what they are, what they do,\nwhat makes them different from the rest.\n\n549\n00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:54,811\nBecause there are some big differences and\nsome really significant differences\n\n550\n00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:58,590\nbetween them that you just can\nthrow them all in the same bucket.\n\n551\n00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,830\n>> Yeah a lot of it has to do with either\nhow they reproduce, how they spread or\n\n552\n00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,510\nwhat they infect,\nthe damage that they cause, right?\n\n553\n00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,590\n>> Or even how they hide.\n\n554\n00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,805\n>> Or how they hide themselves, yeah.\n\n555\n00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:12,230\n>> There's a lot of variations and\nchanges near and between them.\n\n556\n00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,800\n>> Okay.\n\n557\n00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,380\nSo we start with the very basic.\n\n558\n00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,421\nAnd some of the first viruses we saw were,\nas you mentioned earlier,\n\n559\n00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,740\nare boot sector viruses, right?\n\n560\n00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,700\n>> Yeah.\nThat was really the first-second\n\n561\n00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,470\ngeneration of viruses.\n\n562\n00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,480\nI mean, the first really true first\nones were designed just to kind of tick\n\n563\n00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,245\npeople off.\n\n564\n00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:30,100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're very easily detected now,\n\n565\n00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,740\nthey were designed to be pranks.\n\n566\n00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,010\nI remember hearing quite a few of those\nthat were done specifically to just\n\n567\n00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,285\nkind of have fun with people,\nput messages onscreen, things like that.\n\n568\n00:29:41,285 --> 00:29:45,985\nBut then you went to the boot sector ones,\nthen you even started going further on,\n\n569\n00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:49,865\npast that when you started getting these\nreally really kind of advanced ways of\n\n570\n00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:54,735\nwrapping and constructing viruses in\nsuch a way that they could defeat\n\n571\n00:29:54,735 --> 00:29:58,815\nany virus systems and\nevade detection for quite a long time.\n\n572\n00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:04,419\nSo, some really clever ways they came out\nwith once those initial waves got out.\n\n573\n00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:08,460\nSo yeah, do you wanna go through each\none of those different categories?\n\n574\n00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,010\nYou really need to know each one?\n\n575\n00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,620\nI guess we kind of do, don't we?\n\n576\n00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,510\n>> You kind of need to have\nan understanding of each one.\n\n577\n00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,790\nI'll go through some of\nthe big guys in here, I guess.\n\n578\n00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:18,080\nProbably the best way to handle it,\n\n579\n00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,400\ncuz we could spend a lot of\ntime dissecting each one.\n\n580\n00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,500\nBut rather,\nlet's focus on some of the big types\n\n581\n00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,960\nof them to give you kind\nof an understanding of it.\n\n582\n00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,900\nWe talked about, or\nI talked about boot sector ones,\n\n583\n00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,620\nwhich are those are still out there.\n\n584\n00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,070\nDon't kid yourself,\nthey're still out there.\n\n585\n00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:41,871\nBut some of the later ones that came\nout after that, the way I always look,\n\n586\n00:30:41,871 --> 00:30:46,363\nwhen I look at viruses, it's always\nkinda good to look at viruses and\n\n587\n00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:49,244\nlook at antivirus proxies\nat the same time.\n\n588\n00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:53,078\nYou can kind of see when they did one,\nwhen they created a virus,\n\n589\n00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:57,480\nthen something got incorporated\ninto an antivirus application.\n\n590\n00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,345\nOnce the antivirus application\nincorporated that, started eradicating it,\n\n591\n00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:01,937\nthey'd already moved on to the next stage.\n\n592\n00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:03,170\nAnd that's the way it works.\n\n593\n00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,190\nYou have on one side, you have\nthe writers out there that are out\n\n594\n00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:09,680\nthere creating these viruses,\ntesting them and all that, and\n\n595\n00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:13,740\ndeploying them out into the world, and\nthey replicate and reach critical mass,\n\n596\n00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,160\nmeaning there's enough of it out\nthere where it's a nuisance.\n\n597\n00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,920\nThen that gets reported to somebody at\nlike Symantec or something like that,\n\n598\n00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,020\none of the antivirus research centers.\n\n599\n00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,540\nThey pick it up, and then they incorporate\nthat into an update for the database, and\n\n600\n00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,420\nthat database gets deployed and\ngets out to a lot of systems and\n\n601\n00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:35,520\nit eradicates it, and\nhopefully that is eliminated.\n\n602\n00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,650\nBut meanwhile,\nthe guys after they deployed it and\n\n603\n00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,660\nthe virus reached that critical mass,\n\n604\n00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,310\nthey 're ready to come back to the drawing\nboard to create their next wave.\n\n605\n00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,730\nSo, it's an ongoing game of one-upmanship.\n\n606\n00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:47,650\n>> Yeah.\n\n607\n00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,056\nIt really is.\nI always think of security as a cat and\n\n608\n00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:50,750\nmouse game.\n\n609\n00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:54,664\nWe're always trying to defend against\nwhat's out there, and the bad guys\n\n610\n00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:58,517\nare just making worse and worse things or\nother ways to infect systems, so\n\n611\n00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:02,580\nthere's a constant battle, which To me,\nit's what makes security so fun.\n\n612\n00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,420\nCuz it's a constant learning thing.\n\n613\n00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,960\nYou're not gonna get bored in this field.\n\n614\n00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,460\n>> Yeah.\n\n615\n00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n616\n00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,690\n>> So, we've got boot sector viruses.\n\n617\n00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:12,380\nWhat's some other cate-\n>> Macro viruses\n\n618\n00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,120\nare one we've probably all heard of.\n\n619\n00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,970\nMacro viruses were definitely\na later development.\n\n620\n00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,572\nThose came out in the mid to late 90s,\n\n621\n00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:23,950\nand those ones struck pretty hard\nwhen they initially came out.\n\n622\n00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:29,240\nIn fact, there's probably a good number\nof us, and you, that will recall there\n\n623\n00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,670\nwas a point in time, where you could open\nup Excel documents, just to mention one.\n\n624\n00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,290\nYou could open up an Excel document,\nand no warnings or anything whatsoever.\n\n625\n00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,480\nNowadays you open it up,\nit's like you got this from the Internet.\n\n626\n00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,310\nDo you want us to enable macros,\ndo you want us to do this?\n\n627\n00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:44,800\nA lot of that is because of macro viruses.\n\n628\n00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,890\nMacro viruses hit really, really,\nreally hard and as such, they had to\n\n629\n00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,460\nfind some way to stop them from spreading,\nso that was the way of doing it.\n\n630\n00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,780\nThey also did stuff to Outlook and stuff\nlike that to keep them from spreading.\n\n631\n00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,260\nSo they're pretty nasty.\n\n632\n00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,520\nBut they got kinda head off\nat the path pretty quickly.\n\n633\n00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,500\n>> If you're careful.\n\n634\n00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,570\nAnd just to go back, when we talk about\na macro virus, Office applications.\n\n635\n00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:11,770\nMicrosoft Office uses a language called\nVBA, or visual basic for applications,\n\n636\n00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,580\nwhich is a subset of their visual\nbasic programming language.\n\n637\n00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,110\nAnd these viruses were written in that.\n\n638\n00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,040\nAnd if you've ever done any kinda\nprogramming with those Office programs,\n\n639\n00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,810\nvery powerful stuff.\n\n640\n00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:26,190\nVBA has access to the file system,\nto the operating system resources, and\n\n641\n00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:28,850\nall of that, and\nyou can do some really amazing things.\n\n642\n00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,700\nI've got spreadsheets that you\nwouldn't recognize as a spreadsheet.\n\n643\n00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,550\nThey're powerful.\n\n644\n00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,880\nBut the problem was, initially,\n\n645\n00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,620\npeople didn't think about the malicious\nthings we could do with that.\n\n646\n00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,420\nSo if you downloaded a spreadsheet, hey\nlook, this guy's already got a template\n\n647\n00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,430\nset up for doing what I need to do,\nwhy reinvent the wheel?\n\n648\n00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,420\nI'm gonna download this.\n\n649\n00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,270\nAnd it turns out in his macro and\n\n650\n00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,030\nhis VBA was malicious code and\nyour system would just run it.\n\n651\n00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,560\nLike Shaun said,\nyou'd open up that spreadsheet.\n\n652\n00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,600\nAnd that code can be executed\njust upon opening the workbook or\n\n653\n00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,090\nby clicking on a certain cell in\nthe workbook or whatever the case may be.\n\n654\n00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,410\nSo as you mentioned, yes,\nthey've locked it down.\n\n655\n00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,274\nAnd now it's up to us to make sure we keep\nthose settings configured properly and\n\n656\n00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:11,981\nare not allowing macros to run from\nuntrusted sources and things like that.\n\n657\n00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,951\nSo they have pretty much, well, they've\ngiven us the opportunity to protect\n\n658\n00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:17,291\nourselves from them if we take\nadvantage of that, right, and\n\n659\n00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:19,856\ndon't change our original [CROSSTALK]\nmess up our settings, yeah.\n\n660\n00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:20,565\n>> Absolutely.\n\n661\n00:34:20,565 --> 00:34:24,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> But users they don't understand that.\n\n662\n00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,560\nThey're gonna download that Word document.\n\n663\n00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,370\nIt's gonna say editing is disabled,\nthe macros are disabled,\n\n664\n00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,230\ndo you wanna allow them?\n\n665\n00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,250\nThey say, yes, I do.\n\n666\n00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,023\nNo.\n>> Why wouldn't I?\n\n667\n00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:34,315\n>> I know, why wouldn't I, right?\n\n668\n00:34:34,315 --> 00:34:37,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it comes down to trusting\n\n669\n00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,030\nthe people that you're getting\nthose office documents from.\n\n670\n00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,480\nSo, macro viruses,\ntaking advantage of the VBA.\n\n671\n00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,625\nWhat's some other types of viruses\nwe should know about, or categories,\n\n672\n00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,495\nI should say, of viruses?\n\n673\n00:34:48,495 --> 00:34:50,505\n>> Yeah, there were some other nasty ones.\n\n674\n00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:58,075\nEven before the macro ones, we had stuff\nlike metamorphic and polymorphic viruses.\n\n675\n00:34:58,075 --> 00:35:01,075\nAnd those ones, you could say,\nare pretty much responsible for\n\n676\n00:35:01,075 --> 00:35:05,835\nthat feature you see in\nanti-viruses called heuristics.\n\n677\n00:35:05,835 --> 00:35:08,103\nBasically, up to a certain point,\n\n678\n00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:12,640\nthe anti-viruses we are able to use\njust a signature database that look for\n\n679\n00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,010\nthings that match what they\ndo those fingerprints.\n\n680\n00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:18,560\nWhat happened is\nthe anti-virus writers say, or\n\n681\n00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,700\nthe virus writer said well\nif you're gonna look for\n\n682\n00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,520\na fingerprint of what we're doing,\nwe're just gonna change our fingerprint.\n\n683\n00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:31,191\nAnd so they started making the viruses so\nthey can re-write themselves on the fly.\n\n684\n00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:32,635\n>> You've got little\nviruses with sandpaper and\n\n685\n00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:34,940\ntheir little tiny fingers trying to\nsand off their little fingerprints.\n\n686\n00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,815\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\nYeah.\n\n687\n00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:39,023\n[LAUGH]\n>> That to me is amazing.\n\n688\n00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:41,565\nI mean, I remember when I first\nlearned about these polymorphic and\n\n689\n00:35:41,565 --> 00:35:42,691\nthese metamorphic viruses.\n\n690\n00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:45,921\nSo the virus itself is changing\nits own code so that it no\n\n691\n00:35:45,921 --> 00:35:50,700\nlonger matches the definition that\nthe anti-virus vendors are putting out.,\n\n692\n00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,315\nBecause as Shaun said that's what they do.\n\n693\n00:35:53,315 --> 00:35:55,023\nThey look at these,\nthey find these viruses.\n\n694\n00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:56,618\nThey write definitions so\n\n695\n00:35:56,618 --> 00:36:01,790\nthat this anti-virus system can detect\nit as a virus and stop it in its tracks.\n\n696\n00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,090\nBut if I change my code so that it no\nlonger matches the original definition,\n\n697\n00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,180\nthen the antivirus is gonna look at it and\ngo, I don't know what that is.\n\n698\n00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,106\nI'll let it go by.\n\n699\n00:36:09,106 --> 00:36:10,648\nSo that's just amazing.\n\n700\n00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:12,390\n>> And they were sophisticated.\n\n701\n00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,570\nReally sophisticated.\n\n702\n00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:18,410\nYou're talking something that\nmay have hundreds of thousands\n\n703\n00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,481\nof lines of code in it.\n\n704\n00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:25,355\nAnd 90% of that code could actually be\njust the engine that is responsible for\n\n705\n00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:28,570\nrewriting the whole thing\nwith only like that last\n\n706\n00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,710\nremaining 10% being the actual payload.\n\n707\n00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,850\nWhich is substantial.\n\n708\n00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,440\nThat's a substantial increase\nin complexity and capabilities.\n\n709\n00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,720\nBut the thing is, is once you're\nable to rewrite yourself and\n\n710\n00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,910\nchange your fingerprint,\nnow since you can't be fingerprinted,\n\n711\n00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,180\nnow they have to introduce\nheuristics which will look for\n\n712\n00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:49,330\nbehavior that indicates that\nsomething might not be right.\n\n713\n00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:53,820\nAnd that's why in the early 90s you saw\n\n714\n00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,230\nantiviruses come out with a little feature\nthat they'd say you could turn on and off.\n\n715\n00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,590\nNow you can no longer turn it off\nin most cases, called heuristics.\n\n716\n00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,220\nAnd the heuristics looked for\n\n717\n00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:09,610\nthings that might indicate\nsomething not right was going.\n\n718\n00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:12,840\n>> Yeah, so we're looking at instead\nof matching a specific definition here,\n\n719\n00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,250\nheuristics is looking,\nas you said, behavior.\n\n720\n00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,910\nIt might for patterns of spikes in\nprocessor or network traffic and\n\n721\n00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,120\nthings like that.\n\n722\n00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,550\nThat now that detection goes,\nwait a second, this could be a virus.\n\n723\n00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,300\nSo, pretty impressive again,\nthe whole cat and mouse thing, right?\n\n724\n00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,400\nThey create these viruses, we create\ndefinitions to find those viruses.\n\n725\n00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,680\nNow they make viruses that can\nchange themselves on the fly.\n\n726\n00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,910\nWe take our antivirus and\nwe make it heuristics-based.\n\n727\n00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,798\nSo they can look at behavior as\nan addition to just the signatures.\n\n728\n00:37:41,798 --> 00:37:43,648\nImpressive stuff.\n\n729\n00:37:43,648 --> 00:37:44,606\nImpressive.\n\n730\n00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:49,460\nAll right, so we got our polymorphic and\nmetamorphic viruses.\n\n731\n00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,990\nWe have macro viruses, we got boot\nsector viruses or system viruses.\n\n732\n00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,340\nWhat else should we cover?\n\n733\n00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,750\n>> You have other forms of shell viruses\nwhich are actually a really fascinating\n\n734\n00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,210\nwhich would take the bad stuff and\nwrap something around it so\n\n735\n00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,100\nit would intercept calls to it.\n\n736\n00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:09,330\nAnd that way when\nthe calls came in it would,\n\n737\n00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:14,265\nthe calls came in to activate this the\nvirus would intercept that, run its code,\n\n738\n00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:18,930\nbut then pass the call on into\nthe regular, into the real thing.\n\n739\n00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,270\nSo whatever you want to see happen,\nwould happen.\n\n740\n00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:25,660\nBut it would actually run something\nelse before it got to that.\n\n741\n00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,505\n>> Would we put this in like stealth or\ntunneling type?\n\n742\n00:38:28,505 --> 00:38:33,057\n>> Kinda, it would fit in that category,\nin the stealth-type or\n\n743\n00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:36,450\ntunneling-type situation where they\ncould hide very, very well from you.\n\n744\n00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,810\nYou wouldn't even know they were there\nbecause it had that package around.\n\n745\n00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,470\nSomething that's good,\nthat shell around something that was good.\n\n746\n00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:48,080\nAnd it would run its bad stuff, but\n\n747\n00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,060\nit would still return to you\nwhat you expected to see.\n\n748\n00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,970\n>> I don't know if it's true.\n\n749\n00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:55,030\nIt almost reminds me of\nthe beginning days of rootkit.\n\n750\n00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,580\n>> Yeah, you're getting this.\n\n751\n00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,981\nThis would be very crude\ncompared to a rootkit.\n\n752\n00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:04,606\nBut you're still in the same, yeah, so\nthat would be a reasonably good analogy.\n\n753\n00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:06,065\n>> And like a precursor to it so yeah.\n\n754\n00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:10,550\n>> Yeah, so\nthere are some nastiness there too.\n\n755\n00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,800\n>> All right, so we got lots of\ndifferent categories of viruses.\n\n756\n00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,488\nAny other types that we really\nneed to be familiar with for\n\n757\n00:39:15,488 --> 00:39:17,899\nthe exam as far as terminology-wise for\nviruses?\n\n758\n00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:20,715\n>> I think those are the big ones for\nright now,\n\n759\n00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:23,316\nthat you definitely need to be aware of.\n\n760\n00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:27,548\nI mean, yes there are some small\nvariations, inside of that, but\n\n761\n00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:31,650\nthose are the big categories,\nthat you need to kinda file away.\n\n762\n00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,982\n>> Nice, and\nthen of course in Shaun's book,\n\n763\n00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:37,970\nhe's gonna break those down\na little more for us as well.\n\n764\n00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,740\nSo these viruses,\nwho's creating these things?\n\n765\n00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,070\nOr can we just make up our own virus or\nwhere do I get a virus from?\n\n766\n00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,280\nI want a virus.\n\n767\n00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,950\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] That's\n\n768\n00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,260\nthe first time anyone's\never asked that question.\n\n769\n00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,170\nWhere do I get a virus?\n\n770\n00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,090\nIs there a way I can pick those up?\n\n771\n00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:55,460\nCan I get them in bulk?\n\n772\n00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,050\n>> Right, you can get a discount for\nbuying more than one at a time, yeah?\n\n773\n00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:02,967\n>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH] Yeah the viruses,\nif were talking just in context of\n\n774\n00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:07,610\ndoing pen testing which we'll\nkeep it within that because,\n\n775\n00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:12,560\nyeah you can get a virus by,\ntry hard enough you'll get one.\n\n776\n00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,370\n>> Just call my dad.\n\n777\n00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,090\n>> Yeah just go around and call his dad\n>> You'll find.\n\n778\n00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,910\n>> I got spares\n>> Yeah.\n\n779\n00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:24,020\n>> There's plenty of viruses out there,\nthere's plenty\n\n780\n00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:30,110\nof sample code out there believe it or\nnot and the sample codes put out there.\n\n781\n00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,230\nIt's usually put out there for\nresearchers to take a look at so\n\n782\n00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,200\nthey can learn how to defend against\nthem but course it's code code.\n\n783\n00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,095\nAnybody can download it.\n\n784\n00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:45,755\nThere's also shrink wrapped,\nwhat they call creation kits,\n\n785\n00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:49,845\nvirus creation kits that you can click a\nfew buttons in the GUI and hit create and\n\n786\n00:40:49,845 --> 00:40:52,185\nit'll compile one for you.\n\n787\n00:40:52,185 --> 00:40:56,005\nSo you can do one without\nwriting a shred of code.\n\n788\n00:40:57,345 --> 00:41:02,235\nThose ones probably aren't going to work\non a wide scale type of environment, but\n\n789\n00:41:02,235 --> 00:41:03,470\nthey will work.\n\n790\n00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,510\nYou know so that's something\ndefinitely to think about.\n\n791\n00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:12,330\nI will tell you as far as,\nyou know in a this\n\n792\n00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:18,160\nis not the first time you're going to\nhear me say this during this whole\n\n793\n00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,410\ndeal in malware is that yeah,\nyou can use a virus or if you want.\n\n794\n00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:27,370\nAnd that's your call,\nI have really not found a reason for\n\n795\n00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:30,790\nme to go that far in my\nyears of doing this.\n\n796\n00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:34,380\nI've not had a valid reason to do that,\nI've had better ways to test things.\n\n797\n00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,450\nAnd safer ways to test things,\ncause let's face it.\n\n798\n00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,330\nAny of the stuff that we've talked about.\n\n799\n00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:43,970\nWe talked about, we've mentioned viruses,\nworms, trojans, all that type of stuff.\n\n800\n00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,640\nYou can create all of these things.\n\n801\n00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,040\nThere's shrink wrap tools.\n\n802\n00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,570\nThere's software development tools and\neverything if you want to get into it.\n\n803\n00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:55,350\nBut if you are going to do this as\npart of the you better be darned sure\n\n804\n00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,860\nthat that thing is very limited.\n\n805\n00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,940\nThat it's got a kill switch,\nthat it's time bombed,\n\n806\n00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,340\nthat it's restricted to\nwhere it's going to deploy.\n\n807\n00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,910\nBecause the last thing you want is to\ncreate a trojan and have that thing.\n\n808\n00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:05,900\nSorry a virus or\n\n809\n00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,070\ntrojan or anything we talk about\nhave that get out into the wild.\n\n810\n00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,110\nAnd you're the one that's going\nto have egg in your face.\n\n811\n00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,190\nYou're the one that's going to look bad.\n\n812\n00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:16,460\nYou're the one that could be facing\nfines and jail time for doing it so.\n\n813\n00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,030\n>> Yeah, awfully risky, man.\n\n814\n00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,690\nHow do you release a virus, but\n\n815\n00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:24,790\nthen say, only stay in this company\nthat I have permission to do my on.\n\n816\n00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,580\nAnd how do I make sure the virus doesn't\nbring their whole system down and\n\n817\n00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:32,540\ncause them serious monetary damage and\nthings like that, or damage to data.\n\n818\n00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,610\nSo probably not worth the risk.\n\n819\n00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:37,060\nThere's other ways that we can test\nwhether I can gain access to a system,\n\n820\n00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,260\nor whether we can reach in here and\n\n821\n00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,660\ndo this, or whether a user is going to\nfall victim to this social engineering.\n\n822\n00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,020\nI don't really need a live\nvirus to do that right?\n\n823\n00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:49,050\n>> Yeah, I don't see any\nvalue in doing that myself.\n\n824\n00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,630\nI mean some people might disagree with me,\nmight be screaming about it,\n\n825\n00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,570\nbut I don't see any really\nany value in doing that.\n\n826\n00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:00,455\nYou're asking for trouble and\npeople that really knew\n\n827\n00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:05,435\nwhat they were doing, being careful\nwith it, have still had some problems.\n\n828\n00:43:05,435 --> 00:43:06,075\n>> Right.\n\n829\n00:43:06,075 --> 00:43:08,025\n>> So really think about it.\n\n830\n00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:11,492\nIf you're sitting here,\nhey this is a great thing and hm,\n\n831\n00:43:11,492 --> 00:43:13,267\nI can use this in my test.\n\n832\n00:43:14,612 --> 00:43:17,922\nReally think about what you're doing,\nthink about all the consequences,\n\n833\n00:43:17,922 --> 00:43:19,942\ncan you control that thing?\n\n834\n00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:21,772\nCan you do these type of things?\n\n835\n00:43:21,772 --> 00:43:26,010\nIf you don't they're going to get\ninto a lot of trouble really quick.\n\n836\n00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,370\n>> The only thing I could ever think of is\nif you're maybe doing a test specific to\n\n837\n00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,520\ntheir antivirus solution,\n\n838\n00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:34,340\nand then I'd probably be doing that in\na controlled environment, a sandbox.\n\n839\n00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,360\nThat wouldn't need to be\ndone on a live system or\n\n840\n00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,550\na production system to be able to see if\ntheir antivirus is going to detect this or\n\n841\n00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,950\nthat or something like that.\n\n842\n00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:41,820\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n843\n00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,250\n>> So let's control that.\n\n844\n00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,220\nA couple questions I saw\nfloat by in the chat room.\n\n845\n00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,930\nI think Mikayla asked, is the shell\nvirus the same as an armored virus?\n\n846\n00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,470\n>> Yeah, you can consider it the same,\nshell virus, armored virus, you know,\n\n847\n00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,650\nI don't really hear the term armored\nvirus, to be quite honest with you,\n\n848\n00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,940\nreally used all that that often.\n\n849\n00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:06,980\nIt's more correct to say, you know,\nthat we have a shell virus,\n\n850\n00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,800\nyou know, but if you want to call it that,\nI actually kind of like that term.\n\n851\n00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,770\nAn armored virus, we're going to have\nto work together to make that a term.\n\n852\n00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:15,307\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n853\n00:44:15,307 --> 00:44:16,915\nSo we all started using that term.\n\n854\n00:44:16,915 --> 00:44:18,981\nAll our ITproTV users right now,\nfrom this day forward,\n\n855\n00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:21,146\nwe're going to call those\nshell viruses armored viruses.\n\n856\n00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:21,919\n>> Yeah, I like that.\n\n857\n00:44:21,919 --> 00:44:23,840\n>> [CROSSTALK.] See how\nlong it takes to spread.\n\n858\n00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,520\nAnd then we could do like amap\nof how long it spreads, or\n\n859\n00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,570\nhow long it takes to\nspread around the world.\n\n860\n00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,988\n>> My next major task is to\nget a virus named after me.\n\n861\n00:44:32,988 --> 00:44:34,090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The Oregano virus.\n\n862\n00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:34,990\n>> Hm, do I really want that?\n\n863\n00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,605\nI don't know.\n>> Yeah.\n\n864\n00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:37,030\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's the kind of fame and\n\n865\n00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,925\nfortune I don't know that I\nwant attached to my name.\n\n866\n00:44:38,925 --> 00:44:41,605\n[LAUGH]\n>> Any attention's good attention.\n\n867\n00:44:41,605 --> 00:44:42,945\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is true.\n\n868\n00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:43,816\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That is true.\n\n869\n00:44:43,816 --> 00:44:47,890\n[LAUGH] All right, so we've got a lot of\ndifferent classifications for our viruses.\n\n870\n00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:50,090\nRemember, those are all\njust subcategories and\n\n871\n00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:53,190\nthey really deal with how\nthey're replicating, or\n\n872\n00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:58,680\nhow they're infecting a system, and\nhow they're attempting to hide themselves.\n\n873\n00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,550\nFrom the system.\n\n874\n00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:03,740\nSo a few different categories that we\nshould be able to recognize there.\n\n875\n00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,680\nThey tell you a virus is, yeah, go ahead.\n\n876\n00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,820\n>> There's one in here,\nthat James mentioned, Stuxnet.\n\n877\n00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,860\nStuxnet is actually a very\ninteresting one, you know.\n\n878\n00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,660\nI since you brought it up,\nin here in the chat room,\n\n879\n00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,555\nit really does merit being discussed.\n\n880\n00:45:23,555 --> 00:45:28,920\nStuxnet that is a whole different category\nof what we're talking about here.\n\n881\n00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:34,400\nIt fits in a category, yes it is\ntechnically classified as a virus, but\n\n882\n00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,170\nbecause of the nature of what it did,\n\n883\n00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,660\nit was highly targeted there's\na lot more intelligence behind it.\n\n884\n00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,460\nIt actually fits in the category\nof an advanced persistent threat\n\n885\n00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,510\nwhich just means that you got all\nthose things I just mentioned.\n\n886\n00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,670\nSomeone has built that for a purpose.\n\n887\n00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:50,950\nThey have inside knowledge.\n\n888\n00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:53,240\nThey really knew the thing.\n\n889\n00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:56,610\nStuxnet has a very specific\nenvironment it's going to work in.\n\n890\n00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,788\nIt's not something that if\nyou got in your system,\n\n891\n00:45:58,788 --> 00:46:01,560\nit's going to do anything to your system.\n\n892\n00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,060\n>> Right.\n\n893\n00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,250\n>> It had to be something.\n\n894\n00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:03,860\nIn that case,\n\n895\n00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:08,560\nit had to be something that was running\na specific form of control software.\n\n896\n00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,000\nSCATA controls.\n\n897\n00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,450\nIt had to be, it had to have\nthe configured a certain way\n\n898\n00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,100\nto get into that environment and\ntake advantage.\n\n899\n00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,250\nThe thing was even reporting false data,\nand stuff like that.\n\n900\n00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:24,360\nAnd then even relied on certain\ntypes of centrifuges, you know, and\n\n901\n00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:30,080\nthose of you who aren't aware of Stuxnet,\nit targeted Iran's nuclear program.\n\n902\n00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,420\nIt even, you had to have\nknowledge of the centrifuges and\n\n903\n00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,560\nthe fact that if they had to\nspin at a certain speed, and\n\n904\n00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,770\nif that speed varied just\na little either way, and\n\n905\n00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,820\nit did it often enough, it could actually\ncrack those things and cause them to fail.\n\n906\n00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,880\nThat's way beyond what a standard\nvirus writer's going to know.\n\n907\n00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,530\nSo there's a lot of factors\nthat got built in on top of it.\n\n908\n00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,110\nHad to get into air gap systems.\n\n909\n00:46:57,110 --> 00:46:59,800\nThere are so many things that had\nto be done right, that's not luck.\n\n910\n00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,780\n>> That's not a typical virus spread or\nanything like that.\n\n911\n00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:09,270\nThat was a targeted attack\nagainst a specific system,\n\n912\n00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,600\nif I can get those words out of my\nmouth and so not something that I'm\n\n913\n00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,620\ngoing to pick up on my XPS or deal with in\nmy corporate environment unless I happen\n\n914\n00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:24,700\nto be refining any plutonium or\nuranium or something.\n\n915\n00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:25,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n916\n00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,420\n>> If you do it as a hobby\n\n917\n00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,335\nlike I do, that\n\n918\n00:47:27,335 --> 00:47:27,915\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't\n\n919\n00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:28,500\ndo that.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n920\n00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,511\n>> I'm going to go home to California and\n\n921\n00:47:30,511 --> 00:47:34,214\nsee\n>> We have some talk to you about [LAUGH].\n\n922\n00:47:34,214 --> 00:47:35,691\n>> Yeah right, when you go home and\n\n923\n00:47:35,691 --> 00:47:37,278\nyour house is going to be\n>> Yeah.\n\n924\n00:47:37,278 --> 00:47:39,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> Everything you own and\n\n925\n00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,853\npeople waiting for you at your door.\n\n926\n00:47:40,853 --> 00:47:41,900\nAll right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n927\n00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,735\n>> I'll tell you,\n\n928\n00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:46,613\nit's about Stuxnet that is,\nStuxnet that some of the stuff that\n\n929\n00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:50,850\nthat it targeted in Iran was the,\ni think those conditions actually exist.\n\n930\n00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:53,300\nHere in the States and in other parts.\n\n931\n00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,450\nSo it hasn't gone off in places like that.\n\n932\n00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:58,210\nWhich even adds another layer to it.\n\n933\n00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,210\nWhy hasn't it?\n\n934\n00:47:59,210 --> 00:47:59,840\nSo.\n\n935\n00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,057\nIt definitely fits in the category,\nit's one of the things that fits into\n\n936\n00:48:04,057 --> 00:48:07,400\na category of what we call\nan advanced persistent threat.\n\n937\n00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,510\nThat's way outside the realm of\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n938\n00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,700\nBut since it was brought up,\nI thought I'd mention that.\n\n939\n00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,640\n>> All right.\nSo we got viruses.\n\n940\n00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:19,140\nYou want to move on into Trojans or\nworms next?\n\n941\n00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:21,080\nI'll let you pick your flavour.\n\n942\n00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,990\n>> I think the next thing to really\nkind of talk about, just for a bit here,\n\n943\n00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:34,160\nis worms because I think worms\nget confused with viruses a lot.\n\n944\n00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,410\nWorms, what really makes them different,\nlike I said,\n\n945\n00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:44,440\nis you just have to be vulnerable, and\nthey spread very fast, very efficiently,\n\n946\n00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,760\nand can cause problems by clogging\nup networks and slowing them down.\n\n947\n00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,820\nBut they can also be used\nas a delivery mechanism.\n\n948\n00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:57,570\nThat was something that there\nwas theorized sometime ago, and\n\n949\n00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:02,330\nsure enough, people would\ncombining worms with the virus.\n\n950\n00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:05,830\nI mean, you think about\na worm could replicate very,\n\n951\n00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:10,410\nvery, very fast and then use as\ndelivery mechanism like a missile.\n\n952\n00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:16,290\nI mean, those things can drop out viruses\non systems very, very, very quickly.\n\n953\n00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,390\nSo you could have some big,\nbig, big problems.\n\n954\n00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:24,610\nIn fact, one of the first ones they\nhad just targeted bluetooth devices.\n\n955\n00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:28,800\nIt was able to wipe out a few\nthousand of 'em over a course\n\n956\n00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,340\nof like three days-\n>> Wow.\n\n957\n00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,720\n>> By using a worm and a virus together.\n\n958\n00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,582\nBut a worm on its own is something like\nI said, just need to be vulernable,\n\n959\n00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:37,670\njust need to be in the way,\nand it spreads.\n\n960\n00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:42,779\nThings that we have,\nwe have things like Klez,\n\n961\n00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:49,180\nCode Red, Nimda,\nthere's a lot of them out there.\n\n962\n00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,570\nAnd the scary thing about it\nis stuff like Code Red and\n\n963\n00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:57,575\nNimda, we're talking 15 years or somewhere\naround there, you'd think they're gone.\n\n964\n00:49:57,575 --> 00:49:58,900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're not gone.\n\n965\n00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:04,020\nIf you're vulnerable, even today,\nit's gonna find you, and\n\n966\n00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,794\nthat's because people just haven't\npatched their systems they're\n\n967\n00:50:06,794 --> 00:50:09,600\nmaintaining correctly\n>> And you're the reason it's still out\n\n968\n00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,940\nthere if you're unpatched\nagainst this stuff, right?\n\n969\n00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,332\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean, honestly,\n\n970\n00:50:13,332 --> 00:50:17,900\nas you said, they've been around\nforever and if they've got no host,\n\n971\n00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,030\nthey eventually die, or if they've\ngot no machines that are vulnerable,\n\n972\n00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:25,980\nthey just can't do anything,\nso patch your machines.\n\n973\n00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,430\nI do have a couple of\ninteresting maps here.\n\n974\n00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,380\nWe were talking about how fast these\nthings go, and if you wanna pull\n\n975\n00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,560\nmy screen up for just a second, there,\nJason, this one was, which one was this?\n\n976\n00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,440\nThis was Code Red.\n\n977\n00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,220\nLet me refresh that guy for you.\n\n978\n00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:46,200\nAnd if you watch the time stamp down here,\nyou'll see that as it starts growing.\n\n979\n00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,440\n>> Get some Oxy 10.\n\n980\n00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:47,940\n>> Yeah.\n\n981\n00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,904\nRight?\n>> Rub it on there.\n\n982\n00:50:48,904 --> 00:50:52,860\n[LAUGH]\n>> This number's gonna start going faster\n\n983\n00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,920\nand faster and faster as far as.\n\n984\n00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,600\nThere it goes.\n\n985\n00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,535\nAnd now it's taking off, 100-200 thousand.\n\n986\n00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:01,890\nIt's just exploding.\n\n987\n00:51:01,890 --> 00:51:05,070\nI'll see if I can catch\nthe last time stamp.\n\n988\n00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:08,230\nI want to say this is within,\nI think this loop is for 24 hours, yeah.\n\n989\n00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:12,280\nThat was a 24 hour loop and\nit pretty much covered everywhere.\n\n990\n00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,450\nAnother interesting one was SQL Slammer.\n\n991\n00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:20,477\nIf we take a look at those maps, so\nhere take a peek at this time stamp,\n\n992\n00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:25,360\nwe're looking at January 25th,\n5:29, back in 2003.\n\n993\n00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,160\nZero hosts infected with Slammer or\nSapphire and\n\n994\n00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,820\nwe click on this second one and\n30 minutes later, right?\n\n995\n00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,108\nThat is 6 AM.\n\n996\n00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:40,330\n74,000 hosts infected\nwithin 30 minutes and\n\n997\n00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:43,440\nyou can see it's not limited\nto a single geographical area.\n\n998\n00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,680\nThat's the power of\nthe Internet right there.\n\n999\n00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,070\nThat really is is that these things\ncan spread tremendously fast.\n\n1000\n00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,225\nAnd that first animation you showed.\n\n1001\n00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:55,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Like you pointed out,\n\n1002\n00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,280\nstarted very slow.\n\n1003\n00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,290\nIt's working on that same kind of thing.\n\n1004\n00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,250\nYou may remember in grade school,\nthey said what do you,\n\n1005\n00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,300\ndo you want me to give you\na million dollars now?\n\n1006\n00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,660\nOr do you want me to give you a penny and\nthen double it the first day,\n\n1007\n00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:09,910\nthen go two pennies, four pennies,\nand keep doubling that every day for\n\n1008\n00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,120\n30 days and you take the final amount.\n\n1009\n00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,760\nWhich one do you want?\n\n1010\n00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,550\nIt sounds like,\noh I'll take a million dollars.\n\n1011\n00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,840\nI don't want a penny, and double that.\n\n1012\n00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,390\nIt's going to be nothing.\n\n1013\n00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:22,110\nWell, that's what happens here,\nit's the same thing in that problem.\n\n1014\n00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:24,780\nIs that it doesnt look like\nmuch when it gets started, but\n\n1015\n00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,210\nonce it crosses a certain\nthreshold it's exponential growth.\n\n1016\n00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:32,190\nSo a worm really works with that.\n\n1017\n00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,540\nI just have to release enough of it\nout in the wild to get it that way.\n\n1018\n00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,280\nAnd what's also fascinating when\nyou look at something like this,\n\n1019\n00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,320\nthis animation, you can start to\nidentify areas that have major\n\n1020\n00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,330\nInternet connectivity really quickly.\n\n1021\n00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,870\nThey have the bigger blotches on it.\n\n1022\n00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:48,740\nYou can see Korea in there.\n\n1023\n00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,998\nKorea's wired really, really well.\n\n1024\n00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:52,279\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Korea has a very,\n\n1025\n00:52:52,279 --> 00:52:54,286\nvery well developed internet structure.\n\n1026\n00:52:54,286 --> 00:52:55,866\nSo does Japan.\n\n1027\n00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:58,230\nAnd so do we to a degree.\n\n1028\n00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,660\nA little lesser I guess\nthan those guys do.\n\n1029\n00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,190\nLesser higher speed stuff.\n\n1030\n00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:03,670\nBut you can see the population centers.\n\n1031\n00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:06,410\nI mean you can see over in California.\n\n1032\n00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:10,270\nYou could see Silicon Valley and all those\nareas over there where they're very,\n\n1033\n00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,220\nvery wired.\n\n1034\n00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:14,790\n>> High density of connected machines out\nthere which gives those worms the ability\n\n1035\n00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:18,820\nto just find new hosts,\nreplicate and keep on trucking.\n\n1036\n00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,680\nAnd then there's areas that don't have,\n\n1037\n00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,109\nobviously Greenland maybe\nnot a lot of connectivity.\n\n1038\n00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:27,290\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1039\n00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:31,560\n>> So it is amazing in how fast it can go.\n\n1040\n00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,010\nA lot of these guys would\nbasically just DOS your networks.\n\n1041\n00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:37,440\nIt's almost like some of those\ndon't even have a payload.\n\n1042\n00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,030\nThey're just creating so\n\n1043\n00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:42,920\nmuch replication traffic, that they\nend up giving you a denial of service.\n\n1044\n00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,892\nI remember, we got SQL slammer at\na company that I worked at, had some\n\n1045\n00:53:46,892 --> 00:53:52,120\nunpatched 2000 machines and Microsoft came\nout with the patch free quickly for that.\n\n1046\n00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:55,434\nBut we had a class room environment\nwhere we set these machines up to teach\n\n1047\n00:53:55,434 --> 00:53:58,040\nsome SQL, and\nwe're not gonna patch 'em down every time\n\n1048\n00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:01,820\ncuz I'm just gonna blow 'em away and set\nup again for tomorrow and blah blah blah.\n\n1049\n00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,774\nHad an instructor get a little lazy,\n\n1050\n00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:07,880\ndidn't patch it, connected 'em to\nthe internet, and that was all it took.\n\n1051\n00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,800\nAnd our whole network shut down.\n\n1052\n00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,490\nWe had to stop everything and\njust clean it up.\n\n1053\n00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:17,810\n>> Yeah, they're extremely dangerous and\nextremely effective.\n\n1054\n00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:22,572\nYou're talking widespread denial of\nservice when these things go crazy,\n\n1055\n00:54:22,572 --> 00:54:24,580\nwhen these are unleashed.\n\n1056\n00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,450\nWhich is another reason talks to what\nI just mentioned about viruses and\n\n1057\n00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,190\nuses part of the test.\n\n1058\n00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:32,800\nAnd can you imagine using a worm as\npart of a test and you screw up and\n\n1059\n00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,480\nit gets loose?\n\n1060\n00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,100\n>> [LAUGH] right?\n\n1061\n00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:39,204\n>> You might as well just cash everything\nin and move to Greenland apparently.\n\n1062\n00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:40,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1063\n00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,030\nYou're not gonna get a lot of business as\na pen tester after that I don't think.\n\n1064\n00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,910\nAnd you're gonna have one of those maps\nnamed after you, so yeah not a good thing.\n\n1065\n00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,980\n>> Yeah.\n\n1066\n00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:53,125\n>> And that's just the least\nbad things that can happen.\n\n1067\n00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:58,225\nYou could have the government or\nseveral governments come after you,\n\n1068\n00:54:58,225 --> 00:55:01,770\nand they will come after you if\nyou cause enough of a disruption.\n\n1069\n00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:06,540\nPeople are specifically designated\nto do forensic analysis of this,\n\n1070\n00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,530\nand find out what's going on.\n\n1071\n00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:08,779\n>> Right.\nFigure out where it was written,\n\n1072\n00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:10,570\nwho wrote it, and\ntry to trace it back to the originator.\n\n1073\n00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:11,070\n>> Yeah.\n\n1074\n00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:15,990\nThey actually threw some guy\nin jail with the Melissa one.\n\n1075\n00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,910\nThat was a piece of trivia.\n\n1076\n00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:22,660\nIt just shows you how, just how aggressive\nthey can be at tracking this stuff down.\n\n1077\n00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,910\nThat one was pretty bad.\n\n1078\n00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:26,101\nWhat they did, is they went through and\ndissected it, and\n\n1079\n00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:27,320\ndid reverse engineering on it.\n\n1080\n00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,390\nAnd found like a word\nfrom the Simpsons on it.\n\n1081\n00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,930\nThey already had an IP to track\nit down where it came from.\n\n1082\n00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,450\nAnd they were trying to track\ndown which person on there.\n\n1083\n00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:39,360\nAnd they found a word that\nwas really kind of weird.\n\n1084\n00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,120\nThey looked up that word and checked it.\n\n1085\n00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:41,970\nIt came from The Simpsons.\n\n1086\n00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,670\nSo they thought,\nwell who here likes The Simpsons a lot.\n\n1087\n00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:45,950\nAnd they tracked it down to that.\n\n1088\n00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:51,935\nOnce they had the IP, they tracked it down\nto some specific person who's an IP and\n\n1089\n00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:56,790\nfound out, yeah it was him and\nhe went to prison for it for a while.\n\n1090\n00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,871\nInterestingly enough,\nhe named Melissa after,\n\n1091\n00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:01,750\nI don't know if you ever heard this,\nyou know what he named it after?\n\n1092\n00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:02,920\nHe named it after a stripper.\n\n1093\n00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:03,460\nI'm not kidding.\n\n1094\n00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:04,550\n>> Oh really?\n[LAUGH]\n\n1095\n00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:06,120\n>> He was trying to impress the stripper.\n\n1096\n00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:10,810\nAnd so\nnamed after her as a way to impress her.\n\n1097\n00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,190\nWho knew that worked right?\n\n1098\n00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,400\nThat's what he did.\n\n1099\n00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,800\n>> Does she come visit him in jail?\n\n1100\n00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,970\n>> There was no word on that\nin the follow up on that one.\n\n1101\n00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,980\nBut that's what this guy named it after.\n\n1102\n00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,850\nAnd so that was another thing.\n\n1103\n00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,142\nWhen they were able to track it back, and\n\n1104\n00:56:23,142 --> 00:56:24,890\nthey're going what's\nthe significance of Melissa?\n\n1105\n00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:27,050\nAnd they were able to bring\nthat back in there too.\n\n1106\n00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,560\nAnd it's like yeah,\ndefinitively, it's him.\n\n1107\n00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,998\n>> Yeah, don't use the word cowabunga\nif you're gonna be writing any viruses\n\n1108\n00:56:32,998 --> 00:56:34,960\nyourself [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah be very careful [LAUGH].\n\n1109\n00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,280\n>> Alright, ladies and gentlemen, tell you\nwhat, looking at the clock, it's time for\n\n1110\n00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,430\nus to take our break so\nwere gonna step away.\n\n1111\n00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:43,806\nWhen we come back,\nmore about malware so stay tuned.\n\n1112\n00:56:43,806 --> 00:56:44,890\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1113\n00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:48,418\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1114\n00:56:48,418 --> 00:56:53,598\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1115\n00:56:53,598 --> 00:56:56,523\nSo, continuing on with\nour malware chapter,\n\n1116\n00:56:56,523 --> 00:56:59,375\nit's time to dive in to\nthe world of trojans.\n\n1117\n00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,460\nSo, let's talk about these Trojans and\nthese covert channels that we got.\n\n1118\n00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,274\nWhere do we wanna start, Trojan, well,\nI mean we all know the story right,\n\n1119\n00:57:08,274 --> 00:57:09,265\nthe Greeks and the Trojans.\n\n1120\n00:57:09,265 --> 00:57:13,515\nThe Trojans roll up this big horse\nto the gates of, wasn't it Troy?\n\n1121\n00:57:13,515 --> 00:57:16,429\nGod my history teacher would\nshoot me at this point, and\n\n1122\n00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:18,920\nthey're like oh look at\nthe big pretty statue.\n\n1123\n00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,700\nLet's wheel it into our gates that\nnobody's been able to get through with\n\n1124\n00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,840\nall these battles.\n\n1125\n00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,530\nWe're gonna pull that inside and\nthen we're gonna go to bed.\n\n1126\n00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:30,120\nAnd in the middle of the night\nthe people from Troy,\n\n1127\n00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,160\nthe army of Troy pops out of the belly,\nslaughters everybody, wins the war.\n\n1128\n00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,830\nAnd obviously that's\na little paraphrasing there.\n\n1129\n00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:38,660\nBut, that's the idea\nbehind a Trojan horse.\n\n1130\n00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:41,400\nLooks like something I want,\nso sure I download it.\n\n1131\n00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,750\nOr I put it on my computer.\n\n1132\n00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,970\nOr I copy it off my media, or whatever.\n\n1133\n00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:49,480\nTurns out, there was something inside\nthere that I really didn't want.\n\n1134\n00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,970\n>> Yeah.\nThat's the thing, really,\n\n1135\n00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:55,190\nis that Trojans in a lot\nof sense look like viruses,\n\n1136\n00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:56,980\nthey really do in a lot of cases.\n\n1137\n00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,060\nWhat we're changing here is we're\nchanging the delivery portion of it and\n\n1138\n00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:06,020\nthat's exactly right, Mike, is that what\nwe do is we are using something just like\n\n1139\n00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:11,700\nthe Trojans did when they wrapped\nup stuff inside the Trojan horse.\n\n1140\n00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,530\nIn this case, we're wrapping\nsome up in some sort of wrapper.\n\n1141\n00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,050\nThey do call it that.\n\n1142\n00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:20,320\nAs what we do is we will have some\nnasty payload that will shove inside\n\n1143\n00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,435\nof something that we want people to get.\n\n1144\n00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:27,125\nAnd what we'll do is they'll\ndo load saying run it and\n\n1145\n00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:31,075\nthey'll get whatever it is that they\nthink they're supposed to be getting but\n\n1146\n00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:33,775\non the back end we're\nactually dumping something on\n\n1147\n00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:38,590\ntheir system that's getting stalled or\nwhat have you and doing its dirty work.\n\n1148\n00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,998\nAnd the dirty work is where\nthe big question comes in,\n\n1149\n00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:42,490\nwhat will you do at that point?\n\n1150\n00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:44,170\n>> Right, right.\n\n1151\n00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:48,238\nAnd there's several little programs you\ncan get where you can take two programs\n\n1152\n00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:50,848\nand wrap them up together to\nwhere you run the one and\n\n1153\n00:58:50,848 --> 00:58:53,520\nit dumps the other one in the background.\n\n1154\n00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,770\nI always liked using the e-greeting\ncards and things like that,\n\n1155\n00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:58,530\nbecause they were busy.\n\n1156\n00:58:58,530 --> 00:59:00,973\nThey made your screen look busy.\n\n1157\n00:59:00,973 --> 00:59:04,772\nYou chuckled, or whatever, paying\nattention to that motion, that animation,\n\n1158\n00:59:04,772 --> 00:59:08,238\nand you might not notice that little\ncommand prompt went on your system tray\n\n1159\n00:59:08,238 --> 00:59:10,348\nkinda open and close or\nsomething like that.\n\n1160\n00:59:10,348 --> 00:59:14,170\nSo something distracting a game or\nsomething.\n\n1161\n00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,060\nAnd see,\nthat's social engineering right there.\n\n1162\n00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:21,830\nYou want something that's really catching\nsomeone's attention, and meanwhile\n\n1163\n00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:26,440\nthey're like what's happening over here,\nI don't even know what's going on.\n\n1164\n00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,990\nThat's part of the game here.\n\n1165\n00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:32,350\nIf you really think things out,\nIf you really think things out quite well,\n\n1166\n00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:33,800\nin how you're going to deliver stuff.\n\n1167\n00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,850\nOh yeah, you can do a tremendous amount.\n\n1168\n00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,060\nGreeting cards are a good one.\n\n1169\n00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:43,390\nGiving someone an application,\nthat you know is popular.\n\n1170\n00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:48,640\nOne that I thought of, is you\noccasionally see these games go around.\n\n1171\n00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,848\nI remember years ago, it was that\nelf bowling game, remember that one?\n\n1172\n00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:51,931\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1173\n00:59:51,931 --> 00:59:53,660\n>> Oh man.\n\n1174\n00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:59,840\nSo, you go through, that website got,\nbecause it was so popular, it\n\n1175\n00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,260\nbasically got a denial of service against\nit, cuz so many people were downloading.\n\n1176\n01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:08,280\nWell if you know that's the case, all you\nhave to do is go to copy that which you\n\n1177\n01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,790\nknow is popular and then shove your trojan\ninside of it and then start distributing,\n\n1178\n01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:16,720\nfind places to put it like\ndiscussion groups and all that.\n\n1179\n01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:17,720\nSomeone's gonna go get it,\n\n1180\n01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:21,110\ncuz you know they can't get it from\na regular site because it's being DOS-ed.\n\n1181\n01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:23,600\nOkay.\nWell, hey, here it is.\n\n1182\n01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,240\nHere, Merry Christmas,\nit's my good deed for the year.\n\n1183\n01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,160\nSomeone downloads it and\nyou just nailed 'em.\n\n1184\n01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,010\nIt works.\n\n1185\n01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:35,930\nAnd keep in mind, by the way, I guess this\nis as good a time as any to mention it.\n\n1186\n01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:40,080\nWe've been careful about this course,\ntelling you,\n\n1187\n01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,830\nrun these tools on a system\nthat's isolated or protected.\n\n1188\n01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:46,680\nJust for safety's sake,\nthis is one of the reasons.\n\n1189\n01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,780\nThere's a lot of people that\nhave taken classes like this and\n\n1190\n01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:55,770\njust do a random Google search, and grab\nthe tool they want from any old site, and\n\n1191\n01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:56,990\nthey Trojan themselves.\n\n1192\n01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:01,820\nThere's people that are black cats,\nthat will take these tools and\n\n1193\n01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,110\nTrojan them, and wait for\nyou to download and\n\n1194\n01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,020\ninstall them on the system, just to\nmess with you cuz they think it's funny.\n\n1195\n01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,660\nYou wouldn't be the first one.\n\n1196\n01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:12,860\nYou're not gonna be the last\none that has that happen.\n\n1197\n01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:13,560\nI mean heck-\n>> Yes.\n\n1198\n01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:18,015\n>> I just had that happen with\na student of mine about two weeks ago.\n\n1199\n01:01:18,015 --> 01:01:19,510\n>> That's a very good point.\n\n1200\n01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,330\nSo be careful.\n\n1201\n01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:23,290\nWe talk about a lot of cool tools in here.\n\n1202\n01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:26,870\nWe give you some links to some\npages that we know are safe.\n\n1203\n01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:28,560\nBut that's a great way to infect somebody.\n\n1204\n01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:31,020\nSay look, free hacking tools,\ncome get them.\n\n1205\n01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:31,740\nYou don't know anything.\n\n1206\n01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,300\nYou're just downloading all these tools.\n\n1207\n01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,610\nLet me click on it and see what it\ndoes and It was a Trojan horse.\n\n1208\n01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,520\nIt looked like something you wanted,\nthis hacking tool, and\n\n1209\n01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,630\nin the meantime it's installing some\nback door and it's calling home.\n\n1210\n01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:45,770\nAnd all of a sudden your mouse\nstarts moving across the screen,\n\n1211\n01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:50,980\nyour printer starts printing out paper,\nyour screen flips upside down, whatever.\n\n1212\n01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:52,659\nSo do be careful where you're\ngetting these tools from.\n\n1213\n01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,200\n>> And just to add on to that, just one\nmore thing to add on to that I guess is,\n\n1214\n01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,980\nif you think about it,\nand you're like well,\n\n1215\n01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:07,000\nI'm just gonna have my anti-virus,\nit'll pick that stuff up, right?\n\n1216\n01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,890\nWell, newsflash.\n\n1217\n01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,170\nIf you haven't already seen it.\n\n1218\n01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:13,438\nYour anti-virus is probably gonna pick up\njust about what you would use in a class\n\n1219\n01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:14,080\nlike this.\n\n1220\n01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,610\n[INAUDIBLE] it's going to pick up just\nabout everything you use as a virus.\n\n1221\n01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,260\nSo, if you got to rely on that to stop\n\n1222\n01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,430\nanything it says hey this\nis bad don't install it.\n\n1223\n01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:29,420\nYou're not gonna be a pen tester\nbecause almost every tool you have, or\n\n1224\n01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:32,950\na good portion of the tools you have in\nyour toolbox are gonna be flagged as being\n\n1225\n01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,270\nmalicious.\n\n1226\n01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:37,380\nSo if you're saying oh well it says\nit's malicious, that's malicious.\n\n1227\n01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,800\nNo it couldn't be used for\na malicious purpose but\n\n1228\n01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:45,420\nthey just flagged it that way to say okay,\nwell it's been known to be used for\n\n1229\n01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:47,580\nmalicious so we're just gonna be safe.\n\n1230\n01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,730\nYou gotta use your own judgement.\n\n1231\n01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:52,760\nThat's why if you're smart about this,\nyou do it on an isolated system.\n\n1232\n01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:53,560\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1233\n01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,840\nI can't tell you how many password\ncrackers I have lost to my anti-virus\n\n1234\n01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,700\nsystem because it sees this and\n\n1235\n01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:02,499\nsays, ooh, this is bad, and\nI'm gonna go ahead and snag it.\n\n1236\n01:03:02,499 --> 01:03:06,630\nSo, I definitely have on most of my\ntest systems a folder called no scan.\n\n1237\n01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:10,790\nAnd I have to make sure that if I ever\nhave to reinstall my antivirus that I mark\n\n1238\n01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,820\nthat as a do not scan this folder cause\nit'll pick up almost all these tools.\n\n1239\n01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,110\nAnd, as you said, it's not that\nthe tool itself is malicious, but\n\n1240\n01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:20,610\nit could be used for malicious purposes,\nso a lot of these antivirus softwares\n\n1241\n01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:25,280\npick it up and try to flag it for you, so-\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1242\n01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,590\nIt can really be a really frustrating,\nbad thing.\n\n1243\n01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:32,540\nWhat you're talking about is\nactually having a folder in there.\n\n1244\n01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,850\nThat's not a bad step to take.\n\n1245\n01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:35,530\nIt really isn't.\n\n1246\n01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:36,800\nIt's a smart way to do it.\n\n1247\n01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:41,960\nAs for virtualization, stuff like that\ncomes in too, just to keep things isolated\n\n1248\n01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:47,470\nand protected until you\nare absolutely sure.\n\n1249\n01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:52,850\nThey actually have something for analyzing\nmalware called a sheep-dip computer.\n\n1250\n01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:55,820\nNow you don't hear the term used\nthat much but it is out there.\n\n1251\n01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,840\nAnd you can use it to\nanalyze stuff like this.\n\n1252\n01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,746\nYou can drop a Trojan, drop a virus,\ndrop these other things in the system and\n\n1253\n01:04:01,746 --> 01:04:05,050\ndo an analysis of it to see,\nare these things on the level or not and\n\n1254\n01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,210\nwhat they're doing.\n\n1255\n01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,130\nBefore you decide to use\nthem someplace else.\n\n1256\n01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:09,460\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1257\n01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:13,230\nI remember [COUGH] kind of funny,\nI remember when I took CEH years ago,\n\n1258\n01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:16,889\nI used to get these DVDs or\nthe discs that had all the tools on there.\n\n1259\n01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:17,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I\n\n1260\n01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,530\nremember slapping that\ninto my laptop one time.\n\n1261\n01:04:20,530 --> 01:04:23,600\nAnd I mean my DVD drive was\njust going nuts because\n\n1262\n01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,900\nmy antivirus software's\nflagging everything.\n\n1263\n01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:26,730\nI mean it was four gigs.\n\n1264\n01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:29,576\nCuz I think it was a DVD at the time or\nmaybe it was a CD.\n\n1265\n01:04:29,576 --> 01:04:31,110\nSo 700, 800 megs of stuff.\n\n1266\n01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,190\nI mean there's actual virus code on there,\nvirus generators, everything.\n\n1267\n01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,940\nAnd it's trying to grab it and\nremove it and quarantine it but\n\n1268\n01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,770\nobviously it's read-only media.\n\n1269\n01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:44,170\nSo I mean this DVD drive was just\nflailing, if I can say that,\n\n1270\n01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,020\nall over the place.\n\n1271\n01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,260\nSo yeah, be careful with this.\n\n1272\n01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,970\nGet it from known, good sources.\n\n1273\n01:04:48,970 --> 01:04:49,970\nWe are gonna be setting up,\n\n1274\n01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:52,040\nlike I said, we're gonna be\nsetting up some lab machines.\n\n1275\n01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:55,120\nAnd I've got copies of a lot of these\ntools that I'll put on a virtual\n\n1276\n01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:58,640\nhard drive so you can install them inside\nthe virtual machines inside a nice\n\n1277\n01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:00,900\nsafe environment and play with them there.\n\n1278\n01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:03,860\nBut if you're gonna go out and get them,\nget them from good, known sources.\n\n1279\n01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,400\nGo to Foundstone, SourceForge,\nwherever it might be.\n\n1280\n01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:13,090\nSo, all right, so Trojans, something\nthat's basically a delivery mechanism.\n\n1281\n01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:18,680\nLooks like something that I want, but\nwrapped up inside that is a nasty thing.\n\n1282\n01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:23,530\nAnd when I run that outer wrapper, that's\nwhen that inside is able to pour out and\n\n1283\n01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:25,470\ndo its malicious work.\n\n1284\n01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:28,450\nCould be delivering any number things.\n\n1285\n01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:29,804\nFiles that I wanna use.\n\n1286\n01:05:29,804 --> 01:05:32,470\nI've seen them used to deliver scanners.\n\n1287\n01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:35,171\nLike, I need to get nmap\ninside the system so\n\n1288\n01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:37,878\nthat I can scan the network\nfrom the inside.\n\n1289\n01:05:37,878 --> 01:05:44,128\nSo I can take a trojan, wrap this nmap up\ninside some game of Solitaire, send that.\n\n1290\n01:05:44,128 --> 01:05:46,701\nAny user on the network or\nmass mail it to everybody on the network.\n\n1291\n01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:50,625\nOne of those users out of all of\nthem is gonna go, oh, Solitaire!\n\n1292\n01:05:50,625 --> 01:05:51,350\nClick.\nRight?\n\n1293\n01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:55,118\nAnd then now Nmap is installed and\nI might be able to further my scan.\n\n1294\n01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,180\nSo, lots of different things\nyou can do with these.\n\n1295\n01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,781\n>> Yeah, they even have categories\ncalled remote access Trojans, RATs.\n\n1296\n01:06:01,781 --> 01:06:02,534\n>> [COUGH] Mm-hm.\n\n1297\n01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:04,390\n>> Those get installed.\n\n1298\n01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,980\nThey do mention one.\n\n1299\n01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:10,480\nThe EC Council does like the single\nout one and it's fair for\n\n1300\n01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,733\nthem to do that because it is used\nin the industry at large, is Netcat.\n\n1301\n01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:18,391\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Netcat is something that you can run as\n\n1302\n01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,128\na server and as a client.\n\n1303\n01:06:21,128 --> 01:06:26,443\nAnd what you can do is you can deliver\nNetcat to a system as a payload,\n\n1304\n01:06:26,443 --> 01:06:31,587\nas a Trojan and have it automatically\nconfigured and ready to go.\n\n1305\n01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:35,127\nAnd then all you have to do on the client\nside is punch in the IP address and\n\n1306\n01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:37,200\nthe port and it will attach to this thing.\n\n1307\n01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,480\nAnd then you could pipe commands\nover to that server system.\n\n1308\n01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:45,700\nIt's really clever and\nworks very, very, very well.\n\n1309\n01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:48,100\nSo, that's kind of\nthe neat thing about it.\n\n1310\n01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:49,820\nHowever, Netcat, just for\n\n1311\n01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,290\nthe record, Netcat is something\nthat sends everything unencrypted.\n\n1312\n01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:58,550\nSo, you could use one of the tools we're\ngonna talk about in a later episode.\n\n1313\n01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:03,450\nThey could use something called\na sniffer that can pick that up.\n\n1314\n01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:08,918\nBut the Netcat also has a cousin called\nCryptcat which encrypts everything.\n\n1315\n01:07:08,918 --> 01:07:11,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So you can definitely do that.\n\n1316\n01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:15,390\nIt's worth mentioning by the way,\nremote access Trojans are one of\n\n1317\n01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:20,490\nthe more common things that are done with\nTrojans to open up that covert channel\n\n1318\n01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:24,000\non a back door on a system for\nsomeone to come back later on.\n\n1319\n01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,160\nCuz remember, we talked about in our\nprevious episodes about gaining access and\n\n1320\n01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,485\nmaintaining access.\n\n1321\n01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:31,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1322\n01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,167\n>> If you gain access to a system and\n\n1323\n01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:38,003\nyou could do it through a Trojan by\nemailing it or doing something like that.\n\n1324\n01:07:38,003 --> 01:07:41,586\nDeliver it to someone,\nopen that backdoor on the system.\n\n1325\n01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:42,086\n>> Right.\n\n1326\n01:07:42,086 --> 01:07:43,647\n>> Now the question there\nI guess comes down to is,\n\n1327\n01:07:43,647 --> 01:07:44,712\nhow do you detect at that point?\n\n1328\n01:07:44,712 --> 01:07:48,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And that's the tricky thing is,\n\n1329\n01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:52,336\nhow do you really pick that up?\n\n1330\n01:07:52,336 --> 01:07:55,170\nIn fact,\nI can show you one way of picking this up.\n\n1331\n01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:58,740\nI've got something running\non my screen here.\n\n1332\n01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:01,275\nYou can see that I have\nsomething called TCPView.\n\n1333\n01:08:01,275 --> 01:08:01,900\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1334\n01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,130\n>> You could also use Netstat\nwith a dash A function on it.\n\n1335\n01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:08,810\nAnd what we have here is TCPView,\n\n1336\n01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:11,181\nsomething you can get\nfree from Sysinternals.\n\n1337\n01:08:11,181 --> 01:08:17,140\nAnd what TCPView does is,\nmine's kind of boring right now.\n\n1338\n01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:22,310\nYou can see some stuff going in and out\nof the connections we made on the system.\n\n1339\n01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:28,814\nBut if I leave it sitting here\nlong enough, what you'll see is,\n\n1340\n01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:33,640\nI'll right-click and\nclose my email client.\n\n1341\n01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:37,724\nNotice the stuff of the email\nclient kinda opened red there.\n\n1342\n01:08:37,724 --> 01:08:38,609\n>> Mm-hm.\n[COUGH]\n\n1343\n01:08:38,609 --> 01:08:41,039\n>> What's gonna happen is that as this\n\n1344\n01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:45,494\nthing's being used, what you're\ngonna see is stuff like this or\n\n1345\n01:08:45,494 --> 01:08:49,110\nyou're gonna see it turn green,\nyellow or red.\n\n1346\n01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:51,820\nIf it's green,\nthe connection's just popped on.\n\n1347\n01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,710\nIt's highlighting and\ntelling you it's there.\n\n1348\n01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:55,860\nYellow tells you it's idle.\n\n1349\n01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,730\nAnd ded means, hey, it's tearing it down.\n\n1350\n01:08:57,730 --> 01:09:01,200\nAs you saw, another connection\ngoing on there that I'm not using.\n\n1351\n01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,610\nThere's a brand new one that popped up.\n\n1352\n01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:04,462\n>> Somebody just connected.\n\n1353\n01:09:04,462 --> 01:09:05,082\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1354\n01:09:05,082 --> 01:09:08,555\nSo, either way, it could be\nsomebody connecting or something or\n\n1355\n01:09:08,555 --> 01:09:09,636\nit's calling out.\n\n1356\n01:09:09,636 --> 01:09:12,070\n>> Yeah.\n>> It could be either one of them.\n\n1357\n01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:15,240\nIt's a really neat utility.\n\n1358\n01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,686\nYes, you can use Netstat.\n\n1359\n01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:21,550\nBut, Netstat had,\nthe disadvantage I see with it is that.\n\n1360\n01:09:21,550 --> 01:09:23,700\nAnd it's not really a true disadvantage,\n\n1361\n01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,690\nit's just the way the tool's\ndesigned to work.\n\n1362\n01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:27,225\nNetcat's a static snapshot.\n\n1363\n01:09:27,225 --> 01:09:30,608\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is dynamic so you could leave this\n\n1364\n01:09:30,608 --> 01:09:35,504\nrunning and you start seeing these\nconnection going in and out.\n\n1365\n01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:37,791\nSo if someone did have\nNetcat running on a system,\n\n1366\n01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:41,604\nwhat's gonna happen here is when they\nhave Netcat running, you're eventually,\n\n1367\n01:09:41,604 --> 01:09:45,197\nif you have something like this you'll\ncatch it cuz you'll see the connection\n\n1368\n01:09:45,197 --> 01:09:47,170\ncoming in and it will be highlighted here.\n\n1369\n01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:49,795\nAnd you'll be able to track\nit back to an IP address.\n\n1370\n01:09:49,795 --> 01:09:51,962\n>> Right, okay.\n\n1371\n01:09:51,962 --> 01:09:55,460\nYeah so, trojans again can be\nused as a delivery mechanism for\n\n1372\n01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,086\nseveral different things.\n\n1373\n01:09:57,086 --> 01:09:59,504\nTypically a trojan is not\nthe attack itself but\n\n1374\n01:09:59,504 --> 01:10:01,932\nit's the precursor to\nthe rest of the attack.\n\n1375\n01:10:01,932 --> 01:10:04,990\nIt's the delivery method for\nthe tools that I'm gonna be using for\n\n1376\n01:10:04,990 --> 01:10:08,491\nthe attack in whatever phase it is.\n\n1377\n01:10:08,491 --> 01:10:11,540\nSay, we really could have used\nthis back in the scanning phase.\n\n1378\n01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,160\nWe could have used a Trojan to\nkinda get us on the inside.\n\n1379\n01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,970\nSo a lot of different uses for those.\n\n1380\n01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:20,340\nRemember, we need to understand that\nit looks like something I want,\n\n1381\n01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,980\nturns out that it's not.\n\n1382\n01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,286\nAnd then covert channels,\nwe pretty much covered right?\n\n1383\n01:10:25,286 --> 01:10:26,031\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think we're good with\n\n1384\n01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:26,628\nthose, remember?\n\n1385\n01:10:26,628 --> 01:10:31,291\nIs using something for something other\nthan what it was designed to do,\n\n1386\n01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:34,336\nis really what a covert\nchannel's all about.\n\n1387\n01:10:34,336 --> 01:10:37,891\nAnd because you're using it in a way\nthat it wasn't meant to be used,\n\n1388\n01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:39,253\nit might not be detected.\n\n1389\n01:10:39,253 --> 01:10:41,040\nThey might not be\nmonitoring in that respect.\n\n1390\n01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,172\nThey're not thinking to look there.\n\n1391\n01:10:42,172 --> 01:10:43,013\n>> Yeah.\n\n1392\n01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:45,960\n>> So that's how those covert\nchannels can remain covert.\n\n1393\n01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,090\nAnd then the last thing we\nwanna talk about before we take\n\n1394\n01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:52,950\nour next break here I think\nis that category spyware.\n\n1395\n01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:56,340\nAnd we see this nowadays all the time,\nspyware.\n\n1396\n01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:00,520\n>> Yeah, spyware is one that you\nhear the term used a lot, but\n\n1397\n01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,480\nwhat does that actually mean?\n\n1398\n01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,830\nWell, like I said, spyware is\nsomething that sits on your system and\n\n1399\n01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:07,180\nobserves what you do.\n\n1400\n01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:13,545\nIt's keystrokes, it's Internet activity,\nit's usage of files.\n\n1401\n01:11:13,545 --> 01:11:16,761\nIt could be a lot of things that's\nreporting back to its mothership is\n\n1402\n01:11:16,761 --> 01:11:17,878\nthe way I like to say it.\n\n1403\n01:11:17,878 --> 01:11:18,981\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1404\n01:11:18,981 --> 01:11:25,260\nthey can be somewhat difficult to detect.\n\n1405\n01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:28,780\nWe could use something like\nTCPView that I just mentioned.\n\n1406\n01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:33,850\nYou could also use any number of those\nanti-malware scanners to do this.\n\n1407\n01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:37,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The thing I'll tell you about it is,\n\n1408\n01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,250\nit's changing for sure.\n\n1409\n01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:44,380\nBut if you look at viruses and worms and\nTrojans and then you sorta look\n\n1410\n01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:48,290\nat spyware, there's kind of an interesting\nway of thinking that happens.\n\n1411\n01:11:48,290 --> 01:11:50,440\nWe still see it quite a bit but\nnot nearly,\n\n1412\n01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:52,030\nlike I said, nearly as much as we used to.\n\n1413\n01:11:53,150 --> 01:11:54,350\nThere's the thinking is and\n\n1414\n01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:58,060\npeople have had this thinking for a while,\ninstalling antivirus on the system.\n\n1415\n01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,702\nOkay, boom.\nPut one on there and it will scan for\n\n1416\n01:12:00,702 --> 01:12:02,130\nall this nastiness.\n\n1417\n01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:06,460\nWe should be trained or\nin the know at this point to do that.\n\n1418\n01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,880\nAnd we know it makes sense.\n\n1419\n01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,811\nBut think about it, when do people,\na lot of people install spyware or\n\n1420\n01:12:12,811 --> 01:12:14,090\nanti-ad ware stuff.\n\n1421\n01:12:14,090 --> 01:12:15,360\nWhen do they install it?\n\n1422\n01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:16,770\nAfter they get infected.\n\n1423\n01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,940\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1424\n01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:20,170\n>> So, that's changing because we're\n\n1425\n01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:23,570\nhaving integrated scanners that do both,\nbut\n\n1426\n01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:28,230\nthere's still enough of a gap there\nbetween how we install anti-viruses and\n\n1427\n01:12:28,230 --> 01:12:31,850\nhow we install anti-malware that\nenough of it's getting through.\n\n1428\n01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:36,960\nMicrosoft's included things like\ndefender in their products since Vista\n\n1429\n01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:42,640\nmoving forward and that's help stem the\ntide of some of this but it's not 100%.\n\n1430\n01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,970\nSo it's something to really think about.\n\n1431\n01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,930\nThat spyware still can be\nsomewhat easy to get on a system,\n\n1432\n01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:52,010\nand stay there,\nbecause people just don't know.\n\n1433\n01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:56,680\nIt can get deployed on a system so\nmany ways, it's crazy.\n\n1434\n01:12:56,680 --> 01:13:01,720\nThey can do drive-by downloads, is one\nthat's very common to do with spyware.\n\n1435\n01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,280\nWhich means that you go to a website and\n\n1436\n01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:08,640\nsomething pushes it onto your system,\nfor example, through Flash.\n\n1437\n01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,460\nI know Flash is gonna run on just\nabout every browser out there.\n\n1438\n01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,790\nIt's a platform out there because it's\na standard, for better or for worse.\n\n1439\n01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:18,500\nI'm not endorsing that at all.\n\n1440\n01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:23,569\nSo you could have, if someone\ngoes by this it goes to a website\n\n1441\n01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:28,950\nand they could have a Flash window\non it that's completely invisible.\n\n1442\n01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:33,650\nYou could definitely do that and\njust attach an action script to it and\n\n1443\n01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,740\nit will download and\ninstall something on your system.\n\n1444\n01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:39,500\nBecause flash is a trusted application,\nit'll work.\n\n1445\n01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,986\n>> Yeah, absolutely, several ways they\ncan get really sneaky with how they get\n\n1446\n01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:47,280\nthe get the stuff on your system,\nclear buttons on top of regular buttons,\n\n1447\n01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,850\nthings like that, but\nthe drive by one always bothered me cuz\n\n1448\n01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:54,110\nthey used to tell people that you cannot\nget infected if you just go to a website.\n\n1449\n01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:55,830\nIt's not gonna,\nunless you click on something or\n\n1450\n01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:59,390\ndo something, it needs that interaction,\nthat's not true any more.\n\n1451\n01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:03,050\nThey can push this stuff out to your\nsystem, just by visiting webpages.\n\n1452\n01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:05,810\nBecause we've got all that dynamic\ncontent, that's that stuff,\n\n1453\n01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:08,840\nthat just runs,\nwhen you connect to that page.\n\n1454\n01:14:09,952 --> 01:14:12,040\nIt is too easy for the bad guys now.\n\n1455\n01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:16,072\nSo Spyware, maybe not as harmful\nas viruses and worms and\n\n1456\n01:14:16,072 --> 01:14:19,780\nthings like that but\ncould potentially be, right?\n\n1457\n01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:24,940\nIf it's capturing keystrokes or\nscreenshots and things like that,\n\n1458\n01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:28,540\nit definitely has the potential to be\ndamaging, maybe in a different way.\n\n1459\n01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:32,940\n>> I see it being mentioned on here\nabout if you don't visit bad sites you\n\n1460\n01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,010\nhaven't got anything.\n\n1461\n01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:39,250\nI don't know if you're joking around or\nif that's serious or not.\n\n1462\n01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,650\nBut really it doesn't\nmatter what site you go to.\n\n1463\n01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:46,290\nIt used to be associated with hey, if\nyou've got this bad stuff on your system\n\n1464\n01:14:46,290 --> 01:14:48,560\nyou need to keep off\nthe pornography sites, right?\n\n1465\n01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,235\nIt used to be something like that.\n\n1466\n01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:51,290\nIt's a running joke.\n\n1467\n01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:54,570\nThat's not the case at all.\n\n1468\n01:14:54,570 --> 01:15:00,050\nIf you look at sites now\nthey just sell ad space,\n\n1469\n01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:02,340\nthey sell a block over here\na block over there and\n\n1470\n01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,930\nsay you can display your ad there and\nthey subscribe to an ad network.\n\n1471\n01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:09,700\nAll it takes is for someone to get on\nthe ad network, as long as you are selling\n\n1472\n01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:13,610\nthat space, those ads will rotate and\nboom you could go to a U.S.A.\n\n1473\n01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:17,540\ntoday or something else and\nget infected on a system.\n\n1474\n01:15:17,540 --> 01:15:22,960\nSo it definitely does happen\nacross all sorts of sites.\n\n1475\n01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,930\nIn fact, I heard research in this,\nand this isn't me endorsing anything.\n\n1476\n01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:33,100\nIt used to be they said if you\nwent to these adult web sites,\n\n1477\n01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:34,810\nthat's where you're gonna get infected.\n\n1478\n01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:39,490\nNow they've said those are probably\nthe safest sites on the internet to go to.\n\n1479\n01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:41,955\n>> Cuz they want you to come back [LAUGH].\n\n1480\n01:15:41,955 --> 01:15:44,483\n>> Yeah, I check them every day to\nmake sure they're safe so you're fine.\n\n1481\n01:15:44,483 --> 01:15:45,816\nNo I'm kidding [LAUGH].\n\n1482\n01:15:45,816 --> 01:15:47,950\n>> I appreciate that.\n\n1483\n01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:52,200\n>> But it's interesting enough they said\nit's kind of switched that way where\n\n1484\n01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:56,430\nthose tend to be the safest ones,\nbecause they're not major.\n\n1485\n01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:01,960\nThey're why that content is\na big thing on the internet.\n\n1486\n01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,910\nThey tend to have closed networks,\nand stuff like that.\n\n1487\n01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:08,980\nWhere they do ad networks, and all that.\n\n1488\n01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:13,560\nWhere you have much larger ad networks for\nthe main stream sites, and\n\n1489\n01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,020\nthey're not vetted as well.\n\n1490\n01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:18,520\n>> Yeah, so the problem is,\nbecause William, I'm with you.\n\n1491\n01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,880\nYears ago that might have held\nsort of true if you kept your\n\n1492\n01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,430\nsurfing practices safe,\nyou could be relatively safe out there.\n\n1493\n01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:29,520\nBut now because, as Sean says,\nwith the whole advertisement.\n\n1494\n01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,130\nThese advertisements aren't just simple\nbanner ads like they used to be with some\n\n1495\n01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,640\nwording or a phone number.\n\n1496\n01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,740\nThey are full motion, they're videos,\nthey're, like you said, they're flash,\n\n1497\n01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:41,460\nthey're animated, they're clickable,\nthey even notice when my,\n\n1498\n01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:45,950\none the other day I thought was amazing\nis I moved my mouse across the ad,\n\n1499\n01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:49,660\nI'm not clicking on it, I'm moving my\nmouse just hovering over the ad as I go to\n\n1500\n01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:53,420\nclick on something else, and I see\nthe eyes of the character follow my mouse.\n\n1501\n01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,280\nSo it's definitely interacting with me,\nwhether I like to or not.\n\n1502\n01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,980\nAnd I don't have any control over that.\n\n1503\n01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,640\nI trust the site I went to but I'm not in\ncontrol of the ads that are being placed\n\n1504\n01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:05,100\non the page, and as you said,\nthey might not be either.\n\n1505\n01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:09,020\nThey're subscribing to some service and\nthey're getting paid for that space and\n\n1506\n01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:12,482\nthat service, how well do they check\nout people before they allow them to\n\n1507\n01:17:12,482 --> 01:17:15,858\nadd their advertisement to the pool\nthat they're distributing out?\n\n1508\n01:17:15,858 --> 01:17:18,191\nSo, [COUGH] it can be tricky.\n\n1509\n01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:22,650\n>> Yeah, and\nhow would you know these things?\n\n1510\n01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,566\nMost of us don't think about that.\n\n1511\n01:17:24,566 --> 01:17:29,040\nNow if you run ad blocks and stuff like\nthat you're probably a little safer.\n\n1512\n01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:34,568\nBut the potential for\nyou to get hit is still definitely there.\n\n1513\n01:17:34,568 --> 01:17:38,729\nI mentioned this one and\nthey consider me for better or for\n\n1514\n01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:41,775\nworst consider me an expert in the field.\n\n1515\n01:17:41,775 --> 01:17:42,566\nYou guys are all in trouble.\n\n1516\n01:17:42,566 --> 01:17:43,650\n[LAUGH].\n\n1517\n01:17:43,650 --> 01:17:47,630\nYeah you might look at me as someone\nwho writes books and all that stuff and\n\n1518\n01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,916\njust consider a subject matter expert and\n\n1519\n01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,620\nit's like well he must not\nget hit by this stuff.\n\n1520\n01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:54,590\nI get hit by this stuff, okay?\n\n1521\n01:17:54,590 --> 01:17:56,760\nI get hit by doing drive by downloads,\n\n1522\n01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:01,450\nand I don't visit any sites that I think\nare weird or funny or anything like that.\n\n1523\n01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:07,510\nI go to gaming sites and news sites and\nstuff like that a lot, and I literally\n\n1524\n01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:13,840\nhave gotten hit going to USA Today because\nI saw the thing pop up on my site.\n\n1525\n01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,340\nUSA Today is a legitimate site.\n\n1526\n01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:19,280\nNo one's every gonna tell you hey, well\ndon't go to USA Today, it's a bad site.\n\n1527\n01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,770\nThat's a good site.\n\n1528\n01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:22,090\nAnd I got nailed.\n\n1529\n01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:23,025\nThat could happen to you too.\n\n1530\n01:18:23,025 --> 01:18:28,358\nSo just something you gotta be aware,\nyou gotta be on your toes for this.\n\n1531\n01:18:28,358 --> 01:18:29,108\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1532\n01:18:29,108 --> 01:18:30,275\nAbsolutely.\n\n1533\n01:18:30,275 --> 01:18:30,840\nAll right.\n\n1534\n01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:31,690\nSo that's spyware.\n\n1535\n01:18:31,690 --> 01:18:33,940\nI don't know if there's too much\nmore we can add about spyware.\n\n1536\n01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,770\n>> Not really.\n>> I mean, you just gotta be aware of it.\n\n1537\n01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:37,340\nUnderstand what it is.\n\n1538\n01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:39,070\nHow can it affect my system,\nthings like that.\n\n1539\n01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:40,960\nSo, good, good.\n\n1540\n01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,350\nAll right.\nSo, anything else you want to throw in\n\n1541\n01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:43,610\nwith our Trojans or spyware?\n\n1542\n01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:45,760\n>> Oh, I think we've pretty much\ngot it covered at this point.\n\n1543\n01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,490\n>> Well, I'll tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1544\n01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:51,570\nThat's probably a good place for\nus to stop and take a break.\n\n1545\n01:18:51,570 --> 01:18:55,700\nWhen we come back, we're going to continue\non with our malware because we haven't\n\n1546\n01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:58,191\ngot to the granddaddy of 'em all,\nthe root kits.\n\n1547\n01:18:58,191 --> 01:19:01,775\nAnd then a little bit about how impossible\nit is to keep yourself safe from all this.\n\n1548\n01:19:01,775 --> 01:19:02,358\nI'm just kidding.\n\n1549\n01:19:02,358 --> 01:19:05,518\n>> [LAUGH] Run.\n>> A little bit about how you can defend\n\n1550\n01:19:05,518 -->

01:19:35,520\nof malware, viruses, worms, trojans,\nand now we're diving into rootkits.\n\n1561\n01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:39,860\nSo rootkits, these are the big bad boys,\nright, of the malware world?\n\n1562\n01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,260\n>> That's right.\n\n1563\n01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:44,990\nRootkits are a really nasty type thing.\n\n1564\n01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:48,025\nSo, we're gonna get to\nthe root of the problem.\n\n1565\n01:19:48,025 --> 01:19:50,900\n>> [LAUGH] How did I know that was coming?\n\n1566\n01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,899\n>> [LAUGH] So drama right

it.\n\n1570\n01:19:58,316 --> 01:19:59,966\n>> We're gonna have them on\nthe edge of their couch, aren't we?\n\n1571\n01:19:59,966 --> 01:20:02,669\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Why do I feel like I'm gonna\n\n1572\n01:20:02,669 --> 01:20:04,716\nsee clips of this on YouTube or something?\n\n1573\n01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:07,272\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look at what Oriyano did [CROSSTALK]\n\n1574\n01:20:07,272 --> 01:20:08,586\nA big ball on the ceiling.\n\n1575\n01:20:08,586 --> 01:20:14,133\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nroot kits are one of the nastiest\n\n1576\n01:20:14,133 --> 01:20:18,431\nthings that you are going to encounter.\n\n1577\n01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:25,500\nAs far as malware goes, and it's mainly\nbecause of how aggressive they can be.\n\n1578\n01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:27,910\nRoot kits come in many different types.\n\n1579\n01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,720\nThere's not just one type of root kit.\n\n1580\n01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,890\nWhich you should expect at this point.\n\n1581\n01:20:31,890 --> 01:20:33,940\nNot one type of virus,\nnot one type of worm.\n\n1582\n01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,690\nNot one type of root kit.\n\n1583\n01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:41,470\nYou know, what root kit you get is\ngoing to dictate just how nasty your\n\n1584\n01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:44,370\nlife is going to get for\nawhile while you try to eradicate it.\n\n1585\n01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:50,410\nSo, the way I like to look\nat the way root kits work or\n\n1586\n01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:54,300\ncome in, is first of all to kinda\ngive you the different levels of it.\n\n1587\n01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:57,210\nI like to think of a system\nkind of like in layers\n\n1588\n01:20:57,210 --> 01:21:00,360\nwhere you have hardware at the bottom\nlayer, then the operating system and\n\n1589\n01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:05,730\nthen applications and other things\ncan be stacked on top of that.\n\n1590\n01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:09,755\nWell, you can have root kits now at the\nhardware level which they do actually have\n\n1591\n01:21:09,755 --> 01:21:15,330\nhardware level root kits that come\nout of the factory like that and so.\n\n1592\n01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:20,615\n[LAUGH] Yeah there have been some\ncases that has actually happened.\n\n1593\n01:21:21,975 --> 01:21:24,945\nWe've had factories in\nChina that have had them.\n\n1594\n01:21:24,945 --> 01:21:27,205\nWhere they have been shipped\nout of the factory like that.\n\n1595\n01:21:27,205 --> 01:21:30,810\nI remember one case where\na disgruntled worker.\n\n1596\n01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:35,560\nSomehow got access to a code\nthat was being embedded on,\n\n1597\n01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,720\nbeing embedded on the stuff before it\nshipped, and placed a root kit on it.\n\n1598\n01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:43,890\nAnd so\nthat went out of the factory like that.\n\n1599\n01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:48,950\nSince it was embedded so deeply, you\nhad situations where people had devices\n\n1600\n01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:52,440\nthat they couldn't use because there\nwas really no way to get it off there.\n\n1601\n01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:55,890\nYou know so,\nwe have the hardware level ones,\n\n1602\n01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:59,530\nthen we have one's that sit between\nthe hardware and the operating system,\n\n1603\n01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:04,590\nthey sit right in there and\nthose one's are just as nasty because if\n\n1604\n01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:09,130\nyou get one at that level the system\nstarts up does all it's checks then this\n\n1605\n01:22:09,130 --> 01:22:12,860\none loads in then your operating\nsystem loads on top of that, what if I\n\n1606\n01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:16,530\ncan do something like that I can tell\nyour operating system whatever I want.\n\n1607\n01:22:16,530 --> 01:22:18,860\nThat is really effectively\nlike the matrix.\n\n1608\n01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:23,215\nYou know at that point you know there's\nnothing that I can't tell you is going on\n\n1609\n01:22:23,215 --> 01:22:25,495\nor not going on and you've got to take it.\n\n1610\n01:22:25,495 --> 01:22:27,935\nThere's operating systems that\ncannot tell the difference.\n\n1611\n01:22:27,935 --> 01:22:31,355\n>> Yeah, absolutely because you're getting\nin between the operating system and\n\n1612\n01:22:31,355 --> 01:22:35,405\nthe hardware that it's making these calls\nto, so it has a chance to either block or\n\n1613\n01:22:35,405 --> 01:22:37,595\nmodify or whatever it wants,\nanything comes back,\n\n1614\n01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:39,832\nso can't detect it, can't tell it's there.\n\n1615\n01:22:39,832 --> 01:22:44,802\nI run things that are scanning for\nrunning processes or open ports and\n\n1616\n01:22:44,802 --> 01:22:46,012\nit just shows me what I want to see.\n\n1617\n01:22:46,012 --> 01:22:48,312\nAnd the problem is the tool\nappears to be working, right?\n\n1618\n01:22:48,312 --> 01:22:50,910\nI'm getting back a report\nwith all my open ports.\n\n1619\n01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:54,554\nOr whatever his processors are running\nit's just not showing me the ones I want\n\n1620\n01:22:54,554 --> 01:22:55,080\nto see.\n\n1621\n01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,260\nBut I have no way of telling\nthat it's not working properly.\n\n1622\n01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:00,910\n>> Exactly.\nThat's how bad these things can get is\n\n1623\n01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:03,130\nonce they're down at that level.\n\n1624\n01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:05,730\nIf someone has gotten one in there,\ncreated one, and\n\n1625\n01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:09,440\nyou get it on your system\nit's pretty much game over.\n\n1626\n01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,790\nThere's nothing really\nyou can effectively do.\n\n1627\n01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:14,710\nWe'll talk about that here in a moment.\n\n1628\n01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:18,800\nBut get in that low before\nthe operating system, it's bad.\n\n1629\n01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:21,260\nThat's going to be a bad day.\n\n1630\n01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:23,600\nThen you can move up\none level beyond that.\n\n1631\n01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,120\nThat's kernel level os's.\n\n1632\n01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:30,710\nOr kernel level root kits where the kernel\nis the heart of the operating system,\n\n1633\n01:23:30,710 --> 01:23:35,340\nit's the smallest unit that makes all the\nprocess scheduling, input output calls,\n\n1634\n01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:37,240\nall that happens at lat level.\n\n1635\n01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,870\nIf that gets tampered with that's\ngoing to be a bad day as well.\n\n1636\n01:23:41,870 --> 01:23:45,250\nYou can get it off a system but\nit's incredibly difficult but\n\n1637\n01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:51,530\nnearly as difficult as getting the lower\nlevel ones off the system are.\n\n1638\n01:23:51,530 --> 01:23:56,020\nThen you have ones that are libraries\nwhere people have replaced things like\n\n1639\n01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:58,340\ndrivers and stuff like that or\nthey install a driver or\n\n1640\n01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,640\nsomething on the system.\n\n1641\n01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,950\nThat, reports whatever it wants to.\n\n1642\n01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:04,600\nAnd then you go up one\nmore level than that.\n\n1643\n01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,520\nYou have application level rootkits, and\n\n1644\n01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,440\nthose tend to be the most common\nones if you're going to see them.\n\n1645\n01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,410\nThose ones are very\ntargeted in what they do.\n\n1646\n01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:15,560\nSony, had a notorious one in there.\n\n1647\n01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,700\nWith their,\nit was a music CD that they shipped.\n\n1648\n01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:20,910\nThat if you put it on a Windows system.\n\n1649\n01:24:20,910 --> 01:24:23,940\nIt would actually install the root\nkit in there and hide itself.\n\n1650\n01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:28,220\nSo none of your stuff in your system\nknew it was there and it would monitor,\n\n1651\n01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:28,910\nbelieve it would monitor.\n\n1652\n01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:31,830\nIt's supposed to monitor your music\nusage or something, your licensing and\n\n1653\n01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:32,776\nit was done for DRM purposes.\n\n1654\n01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:36,980\n>> I was going to say they try to play it\noff as a DRM thing if I'm not mistaken and\n\n1655\n01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,460\nput it under that umbrella.\n\n1656\n01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:40,940\n>> Yeah, they said, oh yeah,\nit's dark DRM stuff.\n\n1657\n01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:42,450\nBut when it was analyzed closer,\n\n1658\n01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:48,000\nit did open stuff on a system that could\nhave been exploited by a malicious party.\n\n1659\n01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,060\nAnd it was only a matter of time, so\nSony released something that says,\n\n1660\n01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:53,250\nokay we'll show you where it is.\n\n1661\n01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:58,410\nLike well great, now we know it's there\nand there's problem that could be caused.\n\n1662\n01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:01,410\nIt finally got kind of untangled and\nremoved off systems.\n\n1663\n01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:02,850\nAnd Sony said scout's honor.\n\n1664\n01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:04,583\nI think that's like this actually.\n\n1665\n01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:05,742\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They said they'd never do\n\n1666\n01:25:05,742 --> 01:25:06,245\nit\n>> Again.\n\n1667\n01:25:07,365 --> 01:25:09,105\nSo,\n>> They'll never tell you where it was\n\n1668\n01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:10,025\nagain.\n\n1669\n01:25:10,025 --> 01:25:10,805\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1670\n01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:13,595\n>> We'll make our rootkits much better\n\n1671\n01:25:13,595 --> 01:25:15,195\nnext time.\n\n1672\n01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:16,255\n>> Yeah.\n\n1673\n01:25:16,255 --> 01:25:19,540\n>> So,\nthat was kind of the nastiness with that.\n\n1674\n01:25:19,540 --> 01:25:24,990\nAnd the thing is when you get a root kit\non your system its going to be a bad\n\n1675\n01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:26,330\nday for you.\n\n1676\n01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:30,370\nHow do you remove something like that\noff a system is really the question.\n\n1677\n01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:34,970\nAll the stuff we talked about it\nto this point, viruses, worms,\n\n1678\n01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:37,930\ntrojans, a scan and then a simple.\n\n1679\n01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:41,030\nA little bit of care you can\nget the thing off your system.\n\n1680\n01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:42,670\nRoot kits are not going to be that easy.\n\n1681\n01:25:42,670 --> 01:25:44,690\nRoot kits, to get those off a system,\n\n1682\n01:25:44,690 --> 01:25:49,300\nrequires a substantial amount of effort\ndepending on where they've hit you.\n\n1683\n01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:53,050\nBecause when you look at it,\nyou look at the basic thing,\n\n1684\n01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:57,830\nthe more aggressive root kits are designed\nto tell you that they're not there.\n\n1685\n01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:59,550\nThey're very good at it.\n\n1686\n01:25:59,550 --> 01:26:02,400\nSo if they get on a system,\nthey're telling you they're not there, and\n\n1687\n01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:07,630\nyou disinfect a system and it says it's\nnot there, how do you know it's not there?\n\n1688\n01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,450\n>> Right.\n\n1689\n01:26:08,450 --> 01:26:09,130\nYeah.\n>> How to use\n\n1690\n01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:11,430\na tool to clean something\nthat it doesn't see.\n\n1691\n01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:13,870\nYou can't tell it to fix this problem,\n\n1692\n01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:16,660\nbecause the operating system's\ntelling you that there is no problem.\n\n1693\n01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:19,920\nYou're running the application or\nwhatever cleansing tool you're using\n\n1694\n01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,090\non the operating system, and the operating\nsystem says there's nothing wrong.\n\n1695\n01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:26,480\nSo, somehow, you gotta get underneath\nthat to be able to get to it, which is.\n\n1696\n01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:27,250\nBut typically, what,\n\n1697\n01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,430\nit's a format reinstall\n>> Yeah.\n\n1698\n01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:31,080\n>> With those root kits.\n\n1699\n01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:34,700\n>> Yeah, there's other, whether, there's\ndefinitely some other ways to get them off\n\n1700\n01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:40,320\na system, but there's a point where you've\ngot to cut it loose and say yeah reformat.\n\n1701\n01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:45,100\nWays to get them off the system short of\ndoing that if you're fortunate enough is\n\n1702\n01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:52,278\nto, one of them is that you can use stuff\nthat doesn't use the API of the operate\n\n1703\n01:26:52,278 --> 01:26:56,160\nsystem do it scan because those API's\nare all being compromised so use something\n\n1704\n01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,376\nthat uses other mechanisms to scan\nthe system to see if it can reveal that.\n\n1705\n01:27:00,376 --> 01:27:00,890\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1706\n01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:03,310\n>> You can use a host based IDS,\n\n1707\n01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:07,610\nwhich will pick up that certain\nthings have changed in that.\n\n1708\n01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,421\nBut that only matters if you've\nrun it prior to being infected.\n\n1709\n01:27:10,421 --> 01:27:11,030\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1710\n01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:14,170\n>> If you haven't run it prior to being\ninfected, it ain't going to help you.\n\n1711\n01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:16,040\nAll it does is compare fingerprints.\n\n1712\n01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,820\nIf you don't have your fingerprints\nbefore it was infected,\n\n1713\n01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:20,740\nthere's nothing to compare.\n\n1714\n01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:22,780\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, and then there's things like\n\n1715\n01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:28,910\nthere's third party tools, like a lot of\nthird party tools, like Root Kit Revealer,\n\n1716\n01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:32,940\nthat System Turtles has, but there's\na bunch of other ones out there that\n\n1717\n01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:38,840\npotentially help you detect root kits,\nbut it's very tough.\n\n1718\n01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,460\nAnd some people will still have their\ndoubts if it's been fully removed.\n\n1719\n01:27:42,460 --> 01:27:47,380\nThat's why when you say about reformatting\nthe system and restoring it for\n\n1720\n01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:52,200\nknown good media,\nthat is considered to be the way\n\n1721\n01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:54,500\nto do it when you're in a pinch and\nreally aren't sure.\n\n1722\n01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:58,960\nBut imagine, there's a lot of work\nthat can be lost off of that.\n\n1723\n01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,643\n>> Yeah, that's my big thing is how do\nI know that I've got it all gone and\n\n1724\n01:28:02,643 --> 01:28:05,827\nit's not still hidden somewhere\nthat I haven't found yet or\n\n1725\n01:28:05,827 --> 01:28:08,460\nis it going to re infect\nwhen I reboot this system.\n\n1726\n01:28:08,460 --> 01:28:10,140\nSo it depends on the system\nI think sometimes too.\n\n1727\n01:28:10,140 --> 01:28:13,312\nBut if it's a client Where we've taught\nour users not to store their data\n\n1728\n01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:16,680\non the machine,\neverything's on MAP drives, what have you.\n\n1729\n01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,390\nAnd it's easier just to blow it away and\nreinstall it.\n\n1730\n01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:20,180\nIf it's a production server,\n\n1731\n01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:23,150\nthen you might try some of these\ncleaning techniques to save it.\n\n1732\n01:28:24,200 --> 01:28:27,515\nBut a good majority of the time you are\ngoing to, like you said, to a backup of,\n\n1733\n01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:29,765\nand you gotta find a backup\nof when it wasn't infected.\n\n1734\n01:28:30,845 --> 01:28:35,805\nSo I gotta find like that known good\nbackup where the rootkit was not there.\n\n1735\n01:28:35,805 --> 01:28:37,627\nSo, that can be challenging, too.\n\n1736\n01:28:37,627 --> 01:28:38,167\n>> Yeah.\nAnd\n\n1737\n01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:40,917\nyou may actually only talk\nabout known good media.\n\n1738\n01:28:40,917 --> 01:28:44,157\nIt might not even be a backup, it might\nbe the stuff that comes from the factory.\n\n1739\n01:28:44,157 --> 01:28:44,797\n>> Right.\n\n1740\n01:28:44,797 --> 01:28:51,307\n>> It could get that nasty at some point,\nso it's really tricky.\n\n1741\n01:28:51,307 --> 01:28:53,837\nSeeing here,\ncan you ever really be sure it's gone.\n\n1742\n01:28:53,837 --> 01:28:56,887\nI see that in discussion groups.\n\n1743\n01:28:56,887 --> 01:29:02,260\nYeah, if you format the drive,\nwipe the drive, everything, thoroughly.\n\n1744\n01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:08,300\nYeah, you can be sure it's gone,\nif you've done everything by the numbers.\n\n1745\n01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:10,770\nBut it can be a very\nfrustrating experience.\n\n1746\n01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:14,170\nAnd if it's a hardware based one\nthen that's a whole other thing.\n\n1747\n01:29:14,170 --> 01:29:18,087\nHardware based ones you're not\ngetting out of it that easily.\n\n1748\n01:29:18,087 --> 01:29:21,739\nHardware based one's once they get on\nyour system, or once they're present,\n\n1749\n01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:25,550\nit may be that you have to scrap that\nhardware, you just can't use it anymore.\n\n1750\n01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:27,700\n>> Yeah, cuz if it's hardware based\nwe're talking about being written\n\n1751\n01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,000\nin the firmware of that device.\n\n1752\n01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:34,310\nI might not be able to flash that or\nreplace that, so that can be tough.\n\n1753\n01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:36,390\n>> Yeah,\nit can be a really nasty situation.\n\n1754\n01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:40,380\nBut fortunately as you look at that\nstack once you go from the application\n\n1755\n01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:42,800\nlevel all the way down to hardware,\n\n1756\n01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:46,480\nthings up at the top level are actually\nreasonably easy to create.\n\n1757\n01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,680\nThere's tools out there.\n\n1758\n01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:54,590\nThere's a tool out there literally called\nFU that's used to create root kits,\n\n1759\n01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,310\nbut those only create\nthe application level ones.\n\n1760\n01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:01,680\nAs you drill down deeper and deeper and\nstart getting into the kernal level,\n\n1761\n01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,760\nthe shim, what they call it that goes\nunderneath the operating system, and\n\n1762\n01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,170\nbetween the hardware, and\nthe hardware level ones.\n\n1763\n01:30:07,170 --> 01:30:09,381\nThat takes a substantial\nlevel of knowledge.\n\n1764\n01:30:09,381 --> 01:30:13,180\nAnd fortunately, there is not a ton\nof people that have that knowledge.\n\n1765\n01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:18,200\nSo it makes it less likely\nthat you will encounter them.\n\n1766\n01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:22,470\n>> And a lot of it is going to depend\ntoo on does it warrant all that,\n\n1767\n01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:26,130\nthe expense the man hours the effort\nthat's going to be put in or\n\n1768\n01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,730\nis it easier just to replace\nthat piece of hardware.\n\n1769\n01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:32,520\nIf I could cleanse that system but\nI'm not going to be 100%,\n\n1770\n01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:36,630\nis it worth putting all that effort and\ntime and expense in.\n\n1771\n01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:41,760\nOr do I just go to a known good backup if\nI have one or go back to original media.\n\n1772\n01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,640\nSo it's gonna be on a per-basis type\ndecision that you have to look at there,\n\n1773\n01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:48,810\ndecide whether it warrants\nyou to try to get that off.\n\n1774\n01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,250\n>> Yeah it can be a bad day for\nyou to say the least.\n\n1775\n01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,990\nVery, very bad day.\n\n1776\n01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:58,925\nIf you've got a root kit on the system,\nthis is just the basics.\n\n1777\n01:30:58,925 --> 01:31:01,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah we're talking about there's even\n\n1778\n01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,260\na more advance removal techniques and\nstuff like that.\n\n1779\n01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:09,720\nI see a bunch of stuff in the discussion\ngroups going on that yeah, a lot of things\n\n1780\n01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:15,570\nwould work, but I mean stuff like\nmodifying hardware and stuff like that.\n\n1781\n01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:21,140\nThat's just not practical for\nthe average Joe to do.\n\n1782\n01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:24,307\nThe average IT person is not going to\ngo in and start soldering stuff or\n\n1783\n01:31:24,307 --> 01:31:26,117\nremoving stuff from the motherboard.\n\n1784\n01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:32,745\nThey're just going to say cut bait,\nlet it go, and get something new.\n\n1785\n01:31:32,745 --> 01:31:33,345\n>> Yeah, typically.\n\n1786\n01:31:33,345 --> 01:31:36,695\nUnless we have James on staff and\nthen we can have him solder that in.\n\n1787\n01:31:36,695 --> 01:31:39,375\nI think one other person has\ncommented that my eyesight,\n\n1788\n01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:43,575\nyeah I try to solder something on a board\nlike that, yeah my eyes are too old.\n\n1789\n01:31:43,575 --> 01:31:45,630\nI need super magnifying glasses.\n\n1790\n01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,370\nBut as you said, it's just the expense.\n\n1791\n01:31:47,370 --> 01:31:51,120\nYes, it can be done, and it'll probably\nbe a fun exercise to do at least once.\n\n1792\n01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,980\nBut in most organizations,\nit's I need that system back up and\n\n1793\n01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:56,010\nrunning so\nthat we can continue functioning.\n\n1794\n01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,570\nAnd I need to make sure\nthe rest of my network is safe.\n\n1795\n01:31:58,570 --> 01:32:01,914\nAnd so,\nthe best route might not be to fix it,\n\n1796\n01:32:01,914 --> 01:32:06,679\nit might be to get rid of it and\nput something else in it's place.\n\n1797\n01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:08,480\nAll right let's see what else.\n\n1798\n01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,810\nSo you know removing root kits,\ndefending against root kits\n\n1799\n01:32:11,810 --> 01:32:16,080\nyou mentioned IDS's intrusion you can be\nhost based, you can be network based.\n\n1800\n01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,910\nWe got a whole module or\nchapter that we're gonna talk about\n\n1801\n01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,190\nintrusion detection and\nintrusion prevention.\n\n1802\n01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:23,400\nBut also the ones that we've\ntalked about earlier, viruses,\n\n1803\n01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,320\nworms, removal of those not quite as bad,\nright?\n\n1804\n01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:30,879\n>> Yeah, not quite as complicated.\n\n1805\n01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:37,020\nRemoving the root kit is definitely\na very, very tough thing.\n\n1806\n01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:40,068\nYou're talking about very,\nvery complicated,\n\n1807\n01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:42,542\nlike you know brain surgery type stuff.\n\n1808\n01:32:42,542 --> 01:32:44,548\nWhen you talk about\nremoving anything else,\n\n1809\n01:32:44,548 --> 01:32:46,884\nit's rocket surgery as\na friend of mine used to say.\n\n1810\n01:32:46,884 --> 01:32:48,790\nSomething like that.\n\n1811\n01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:50,577\nSome people are going to be re-winding\nthis going, what did he just say?\n\n1812\n01:32:50,577 --> 01:32:52,307\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you heard me right,\n\n1813\n01:32:52,307 --> 01:32:53,109\nrocket surgery.\n\n1814\n01:32:53,109 --> 01:32:56,100\n[LAUGH]\n>> Rocket surgery, I said it.\n\n1815\n01:32:56,100 --> 01:33:02,205\nSo, when you took about removing viruses,\nworms, Trojans, spyware.\n\n1816\n01:33:02,205 --> 01:33:05,645\nThose are all actually\nreasonably easy in most cases.\n\n1817\n01:33:05,645 --> 01:33:09,495\nYeah, I'm not gonna discount the fact\nthere are some nasty ones out there.\n\n1818\n01:33:09,495 --> 01:33:13,495\nBut for the most part they're actually\nvery, very easy to get off a system.\n\n1819\n01:33:13,495 --> 01:33:17,405\nAnd if we're getting a virus off\nthe system, get an anti-virus.\n\n1820\n01:33:17,405 --> 01:33:20,995\nAnd there's a lot of documented ways to\n\n1821\n01:33:20,995 --> 01:33:23,870\nget stuff off a system\nthat gets really nasty.\n\n1822\n01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:28,333\nStuff like, some of these, they have\nspecially targeted tools for things.\n\n1823\n01:33:28,333 --> 01:33:31,909\nEverything has been well documented to\nget those things off the system and\n\n1824\n01:33:31,909 --> 01:33:34,475\nconfirm that they're off the system.\n\n1825\n01:33:34,475 --> 01:33:36,900\nWorms, same type of way.\n\n1826\n01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:42,870\nSpyware, spyware there's plenty of\nanti-spyware stuff out there in the market\n\n1827\n01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:48,620\nand I've seen some of stuff in the\ndiscussion groups is getting mentioned.\n\n1828\n01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:49,671\nThere's plenty of them out there.\n\n1829\n01:33:49,671 --> 01:33:56,820\nEveryone seems to have their own\ntechnique mention as far as anti-malware.\n\n1830\n01:33:56,820 --> 01:34:00,330\nMy thing with anti-malware,\nor anti-spyware, or adware or\n\n1831\n01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:02,880\nstuff like that, is I tend to have\na couple of them on the system.\n\n1832\n01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,010\nOne that's on train actively,\nand one that can do on demand.\n\n1833\n01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:12,250\nAnd tends to catch whatever I need to,\nand I've been very fortunate\n\n1834\n01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:16,360\nI've never had only had too many\nproblems in the malware category.\n\n1835\n01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:20,250\nIf you exercise that same level\nof caution, you should be fine.\n\n1836\n01:34:20,250 --> 01:34:24,130\nAnd do remember there's\nthe reactive side which is what\n\n1837\n01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:28,130\nremoval is then there's the proactive\nside which is defensive side.\n\n1838\n01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,923\nAnd that's just being smart about it.\n\n1839\n01:34:30,923 --> 01:34:33,014\nAnd all those things are things\nthat we've heard for years.\n\n1840\n01:34:34,615 --> 01:34:36,785\nDon't download software\nfrom unknown sources,\n\n1841\n01:34:36,785 --> 01:34:41,245\nwhich we've just kinda shot that\nall to heck in this course.\n\n1842\n01:34:41,245 --> 01:34:42,805\nDo as I say, not as I do.\n\n1843\n01:34:43,855 --> 01:34:46,595\nSo there is things like that, but\n\n1844\n01:34:46,595 --> 01:34:51,640\nthen there's also,\n\n1845\n01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:55,470\ndon't do those things like\nfile sharing nowadays,\n\n1846\n01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:59,770\nthat's going to lead to problems.\n\n1847\n01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:03,950\nDon't bring in stuff from home if\nyou got employees, things like that.\n\n1848\n01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:06,800\nJust basic common sense things,\nand then train them,\n\n1849\n01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:12,390\ntrain your employees on what's proper\nprocedure and what's not proper procedure.\n\n1850\n01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:14,990\nSo, they're aware of things.\n\n1851\n01:35:14,990 --> 01:35:19,730\nAnd then that's probably gonna stop a lot\nof your problems right there up front.\n\n1852\n01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:20,840\n>> Yeah, user education,\n\n1853\n01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,650\nwe've mentioned it a couple times in\na couple of our different episodes.\n\n1854\n01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:25,660\nBut user education is key,\n\n1855\n01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:28,910\nbecause I can do everything I\ncan to secure that network, and\n\n1856\n01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:33,860\nit takes one user to click on that\nTrojan horse, to bring that malware in.\n\n1857\n01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,980\nThen it's allowed to call home,\ncuz now it's inside,\n\n1858\n01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,440\nit's not return traffic anymore.\n\n1859\n01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,290\nIt's return traffic,\nnot unsolicited inbound traffic.\n\n1860\n01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:42,620\nIt makes a mess.\n\n1861\n01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:47,610\nSo we've got to teach our users\nabout how to keep the network safe.\n\n1862\n01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:48,850\nTo me, viruses and\n\n1863\n01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:53,850\nworms, worms are typically a little\neasier to get rid of, wouldn't you think?\n\n1864\n01:35:53,850 --> 01:35:56,898\nCuz worms are stand alone, or\nthey're not attached to a file.\n\n1865\n01:35:56,898 --> 01:35:59,045\nSo I can typically find them and\nget rid of them,\n\n1866\n01:35:59,045 --> 01:36:01,130\nif I can stop them from replicating.\n\n1867\n01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:04,060\nViruses, on the other hand,\nare attached to files, and sometimes\n\n1868\n01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:08,330\nit can be difficult to figure out which\nfiles are infected or to get them off.\n\n1869\n01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,051\nRight?\nI know you've probably\n\n1870\n01:36:09,051 --> 01:36:10,130\nbeen through that a few times yourself.\n\n1871\n01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:10,840\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1872\n01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:12,591\n[LAUGH]\n>> You'd think you got everything,\n\n1873\n01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:14,630\nyou got that system all cleaned up,\nyou've reboot it.\n\n1874\n01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:17,554\nAnd it comes right back as\none of the system files,\n\n1875\n01:36:17,554 --> 01:36:19,610\nor a file you click on is infected.\n\n1876\n01:36:19,610 --> 01:36:21,620\nAnd there it is all over again.\n\n1877\n01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:25,255\nBut still, a lot easier to get rid of,\nthan say, our rootkits.\n\n1878\n01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:31,810\nAnd I love the idea of\nmultiple adware type programs.\n\n1879\n01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:33,280\nCuz they get update differently, right?\n\n1880\n01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,250\nAnd some people might have written\na definition for theirs, but\n\n1881\n01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:37,360\nnot the competition yet.\n\n1882\n01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:43,520\nSo having more than one choice to run,\none of them might not find anything,\n\n1883\n01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,695\nyou run the second and\nsure enough it finds it.\n\n1884\n01:36:46,695 --> 01:36:50,270\nAnti-Virus, though, you can't really\nrun more than one Anti-Virus, right?\n\n1885\n01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:52,170\n>> No, you really can't.\n\n1886\n01:36:52,170 --> 01:36:55,820\nIt's going to cause you problems\nif you run more than one.\n\n1887\n01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:59,180\nYou're gonna get not just\nresources being sucked up, but\n\n1888\n01:36:59,180 --> 01:37:03,160\nthere's a potential while the two\nare running, that they could step onto\n\n1889\n01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:07,480\neach other's feet and cause all sorts\nof alerts to go over to your system.\n\n1890\n01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:09,620\nIt's just not something you can do.\n\n1891\n01:37:09,620 --> 01:37:10,160\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1892\n01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:13,650\nOne of them will see the other one\nscanning files and assume that's\n\n1893\n01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:18,000\na malicious process and try to kill it or\ntry to stop and try to send an alert.\n\n1894\n01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,191\nNever good.\nSo typically one good antivirus but\n\n1895\n01:37:20,191 --> 01:37:24,448\nthen as far as the malware scanners and\nthings like that are running on demand,\n\n1896\n01:37:24,448 --> 01:37:26,011\nrun those anytime you want.\n\n1897\n01:37:26,011 --> 01:37:27,752\nSo I usually have a few of them.\n\n1898\n01:37:27,752 --> 01:37:29,285\nI had a good question\nthere in the chat room.\n\n1899\n01:37:29,285 --> 01:37:32,245\nHow many popular port numbers for Trojans,\n\n1900\n01:37:32,245 --> 01:37:35,368\nviruses are covered in the exam,\nor are they?\n\n1901\n01:37:35,368 --> 01:37:40,158\nDo we need to know some of those port\nnumbers that some of those major\n\n1902\n01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:41,196\nplayers use?\n\n1903\n01:37:41,196 --> 01:37:42,125\n>> Not really.\n\n1904\n01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:45,989\nThey used to require that you\nmemorize some of those, but\n\n1905\n01:37:45,989 --> 01:37:50,700\nthat's really changed just because\nthe port numbers are changed.\n\n1906\n01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:53,740\nThey're not gonna stay with\nthose same port numbers.\n\n1907\n01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:58,460\nIf you ever get a chance to browse\nthe official EC council material.\n\n1908\n01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,910\nThey'll give you a list of like 30 or\n\n1909\n01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:04,790\n40 of those that says these\nare ports that Trojans use.\n\n1910\n01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:07,530\nThey don't use the same ones all the time.\n\n1911\n01:38:07,530 --> 01:38:12,230\nWhat I'm gonna tell is if you do\na port scan against the system\n\n1912\n01:38:12,230 --> 01:38:16,370\nas part of your normal security checks or\nwhatever.\n\n1913\n01:38:16,370 --> 01:38:20,400\nOr checking the system cause\nyou're suspicious of it.\n\n1914\n01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:25,650\nScan it and if you see any port numbers\nyou don't recognize, you look them up.\n\n1915\n01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,880\nYou can actually do the banner grabs and\nstuff like that.\n\n1916\n01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:30,453\nStuff we did during our foot printing and\nenumeration phase.\n\n1917\n01:38:30,453 --> 01:38:35,190\nYou could do some of those things here and\nmaybe reveal what their existence is.\n\n1918\n01:38:35,190 --> 01:38:38,255\nIf there's something nasty going on there.\n\n1919\n01:38:38,255 --> 01:38:41,991\n>> Absolutely, run your tools,\nobserve your systems, and\n\n1920\n01:38:41,991 --> 01:38:45,360\nthen use the resources that\nare at your fingertips.\n\n1921\n01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:49,432\nWe talked about what makes a good ethical\nhacker, being resourceful, being able\n\n1922\n01:38:49,432 --> 01:38:53,695\nto find that information is as important,\nbecause as you said, it's very dynamic.\n\n1923\n01:38:53,695 --> 01:38:55,321\nI mean, the bad guys know, right?\n\n1924\n01:38:55,321 --> 01:38:59,847\nMaybe years ago, you might say, oh my\ngosh, you've got something on that port,\n\n1925\n01:38:59,847 --> 01:39:02,356\nthat's gonna be back office, or whatever.\n\n1926\n01:39:02,356 --> 01:39:05,340\nIt changes,\nI mean they're not stupid either.\n\n1927\n01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,980\nThey're gonna change those\nports up to make sure,\n\n1928\n01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:09,510\nthey're trying to prevent being detected.\n\n1929\n01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:13,190\nSo they don't want to make it easy for\nus to see what's running.\n\n1930\n01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,350\nBut knowing what's good,\nhaving good baselines, right,\n\n1931\n01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:18,210\nknowing what the system\nis normally running.\n\n1932\n01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:20,640\nWhat ports are normally connected\n\n1933\n01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,740\ngoes a long way because now\nall the sudden I can compare.\n\n1934\n01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:25,460\nAnd I say, oh look there's more\nports then are normally open,\n\n1935\n01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:28,720\nwhat the heck are these high\nend dynamic ports doing open?\n\n1936\n01:39:28,720 --> 01:39:30,190\nSo just knowing your systems,\n\n1937\n01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:33,540\nknowing what's normal can help\nyou spot the abnormalities.\n\n1938\n01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:40,220\n>> Yeah, you got to be smart about it and\nknow your system.\n\n1939\n01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:42,883\nI think it's also something\nelse to mention on this,\n\n1940\n01:39:42,883 --> 01:39:45,841\nyou're talking about defenses and\nremoval of this stuff,\n\n1941\n01:39:45,841 --> 01:39:49,646\nas a little foot note to this, as were\nkind of wrapping stuff up here on this.\n\n1942\n01:39:49,646 --> 01:39:52,415\nIs they've actually used\nsome of these things\n\n1943\n01:39:52,415 --> 01:39:55,544\nin the past to remove things\nlike worms and viruses.\n\n1944\n01:39:55,544 --> 01:39:59,050\nThey've used to remove\nother pieces of malware.\n\n1945\n01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:00,025\n>> Right.\n\n1946\n01:40:00,025 --> 01:40:01,349\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's been done.\n\n1947\n01:40:01,349 --> 01:40:03,350\nThey used a worm at one point.\n\n1948\n01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:04,940\nThey unleashed it to go out there and\n\n1949\n01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:07,820\nremove some of this\nnastiness off the Internet.\n\n1950\n01:40:07,820 --> 01:40:11,450\nI remember one that happened where\npeople were getting infected by this,\n\n1951\n01:40:11,450 --> 01:40:13,140\naffected by a piece of malware.\n\n1952\n01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:16,531\nAnd somebody went out and proactively\ncreated a worm that went out and\n\n1953\n01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:17,935\nif it scanned your system and\n\n1954\n01:40:17,935 --> 01:40:20,989\nfound that it was infected it\nIt would disinfect your system.\n\n1955\n01:40:20,989 --> 01:40:22,567\nAnd move on to the next one.\n\n1956\n01:40:22,567 --> 01:40:23,264\n>> Nice.\n\n1957\n01:40:23,264 --> 01:40:27,025\n>> So, but that's questionable\nif that's a good method or not.\n\n1958\n01:40:27,025 --> 01:40:27,652\n>> Right.\n\n1959\n01:40:27,652 --> 01:40:30,944\n>> Cuz you're still creating what's in\nessence, a piece of malware cuz it's going\n\n1960\n01:40:30,944 --> 01:40:33,921\ninto someone's system and doing\nsomething without their knowledge so.\n\n1961\n01:40:33,921 --> 01:40:37,531\n>> That could very easily maybe not\nknowing exactly what I'm doing take that\n\n1962\n01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:39,285\nand then tweak it just a little bit.\n\n1963\n01:40:39,285 --> 01:40:42,387\nAnd now all the sudden that thing that\nwas doing good is now going out there and\n\n1964\n01:40:42,387 --> 01:40:43,320\nreeking havoc.\n\n1965\n01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:44,950\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n1966\n01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:49,290\nAnd there's also a talk of rootkits being\n\n1967\n01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:53,470\nused as the next generation\nagainst anti-malware.\n\n1968\n01:40:53,470 --> 01:40:54,670\nYou can believe it.\n\n1969\n01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:58,610\nWhere instead of slipping in something\nthat's evil, between the hardware and\n\n1970\n01:40:58,610 --> 01:41:00,860\nthe operating system,\nslipping in something that's good,\n\n1971\n01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:03,080\nthat actually blocks\nanything from happening.\n\n1972\n01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:06,000\nYou can intercept all those low\nlevel API calls, and all that.\n\n1973\n01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:09,410\nBlock any other rootkits, or\nanything else from getting on that system.\n\n1974\n01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:13,040\nSo that's already being\nactively researched.\n\n1975\n01:41:13,040 --> 01:41:14,350\n>> Almost like virtualizing,\n\n1976\n01:41:14,350 --> 01:41:17,020\nyou're not gonna install directly\non the hardware yourself anymore.\n\n1977\n01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:19,470\nYou're gonna install on\ntop of a hypervisor.\n\n1978\n01:41:19,470 --> 01:41:20,000\n>> Basically.\n>> Or\n\n1979\n01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,200\nsomething like that,\nto kinda obfuscate that underlying layer.\n\n1980\n01:41:24,200 --> 01:41:25,500\n>> Yeah, basically, yeah.\n\n1981\n01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,980\n>> Interesting stuff.\n\n1982\n01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:30,690\nAll right, well anything else we wanna\nthrow into our chapter on viruses,\n\n1983\n01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:34,810\nTrojans, worms, rootkits, and\nhow we can prevent some of those?\n\n1984\n01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:37,648\n>> No, I think we've kinda\nsummed it up pretty nicely.\n\n1985\n01:41:37,648 --> 01:41:38,577\n>> All right.\n\n1986\n01:41:38,577 --> 01:41:41,652\nThanks again everybody for tuning in.\n\n1987\n01:41:41,652 --> 01:41:43,185\nHope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1988\n01:41:43,185 --> 01:41:47,342\nRemember, during our taping, if

00:00:35,162\nGood morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:38,000\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,600\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,069\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:43,465\n>> No, I'm doing fine.\n\n9\n00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:44,200\n>> All right.\n\n10\n00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,130\nGood, good, good.\nWe got another exciting episode\n\n11\n00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,430\nfor everybody.\n\n12\n00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,000\nWe are currently working\nthrough the CEH Study guide,\n\n13\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,940\nwritten by non other than Mr.\nSean Oriyano.\n\n14\n00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,120\nAnd we're on chapter 9 for\nthis episode, which is sniffers.\n\n15\n00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,290\nWe're going to learn all about how these\npackets smell out there in the wild.\n\n16\n00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:03,150\nRight Sean?\n\n17\n00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,350\n>> That's right\n>> [LAUGH] Now we got, good likes,\n\n18\n00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:06,990\ngood episodes.\n\n19\n00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,520\nSniffers, probably familiar with\nthe concept of sniffing it at this point,\n\n20\n00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,050\nin your career but\njust to kind of go back.\n\n21\n00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:15,930\nWhat, what are we talking about?\n\n22\n00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,090\nWe not obviously not talking\nabout smelling the network.\n\n23\n00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,890\nSo when they say sniffing,\nwhat do they mean, Sean?\n\n24\n00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,597\n>> Yeah, if your network smells,\nthat's something entirely from here.\n\n25\n00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:32,425\nso, a sniffer is a,\nis a piece of software that we use to,\n\n26\n00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,620\nyou know, observe traffic as\nit flows across the network.\n\n27\n00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,170\nThat's, that's really it, is, is,\nthat's all it does is design, you know,\n\n28\n00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,970\na traffic flows back and forth\ncommunications from system to system.\n\n29\n00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,495\nA sniffer can pick it up.\n\n30\n00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:46,235\nYou know,\nin a nutshell that's what it does.\n\n31\n00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:50,305\nBut, of course, there's more, a lot more\nto it than that, but that's the basics.\n\n32\n00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:51,085\n>> Of course.\nWell,\n\n33\n00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:52,835\nyou never just stop at the basics, can we?\n\n34\n00:01:52,835 --> 00:01:55,635\nWe gotta take it a,\na couple steps further.\n\n35\n00:01:55,635 --> 00:01:58,275\nSo, you know,\nwe got sniffers capturing this traffic,\n\n36\n00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:01,970\ncapturing this information that's\ntraveling across, across the network.\n\n37\n00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,730\nAnd for this exam we to be familiar\nwith some of the concepts of sniffing.\n\n38\n00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,270\nYou know what we might be able to find,\nand\n\n39\n00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,375\na couple of different\ntools we might use right?\n\n40\n00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:11,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n41\n00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,210\nYeah you, you've got to understand the,\nthe concept of sniffing but\n\n42\n00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,080\nyes, see there are, there are a whole\nbunch of tools in this category, and we,\n\n43\n00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,870\nwe can't cover them all.\n\n44\n00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,050\nWe're gonna cover what's considered\nto be best of breed in here.\n\n45\n00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But that's, that's a,\n\n46\n00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,920\nthat's where we're gonna\nfocus most of our time on.\n\n47\n00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,530\n>> All right.\n\n48\n00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,980\nSo what is,\nwhat is the best to breed for sniffers?\n\n49\n00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,820\nI know that there's a bunch of them out\nthere, and I guess some of it depends on\n\n50\n00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,750\nwhat you're looking for, right, cuz\nsome of these sniffers are generalistic,\n\n51\n00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,820\nmeaning they just capture traffic.\n\n52\n00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,920\nOthers can be very specific, in only\ncapturing a certain type of traffic.\n\n53\n00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,490\nBut then there's general ones we can\ntypically filter the results down.\n\n54\n00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,310\nWe might capture all of it, and\nthen just filter the results so\n\n55\n00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,330\nwe only see what it is we're looking for.\n\n56\n00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,070\n>> Yeah, exactly a, and\nthere's, there's so\n\n57\n00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,210\nmany different types\nof sniffers out there.\n\n58\n00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,560\nThey they all do the same thing and\n\n59\n00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,140\nwill observe traffic,it's just how\nthey observe it some of them the more\n\n60\n00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,160\ngeneral ones we have you can customize and\ndo whatever you want.\n\n61\n00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,500\nYou know, that's one of the big\nbenefits of Wireshark and\n\n62\n00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,445\nthat's why its popular is that not only is\nit easy to use, you can customize it and\n\n63\n00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:15,245\nmold it to look for the type of\ntraffic that is most useful to you.\n\n64\n00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:18,975\nBut, you know, you do have ones like\nthere's the Dsniff suite that has\n\n65\n00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:22,545\ntools inside of it that look for\nvery specific things.\n\n66\n00:03:22,545 --> 00:03:26,485\nThere's another one called Etherape which\njust helps you visualize the traffic and\n\n67\n00:03:26,485 --> 00:03:30,610\nsort it out a bit, but doesn't\nactually show you the traffic itself.\n\n68\n00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,990\nYou know, so\nthere's a lot of different ones out there.\n\n69\n00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:37,330\nIt's just a question of which, which one\nyou what you are trying to accomplish.\n\n70\n00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,690\nFor the most part people tend to like to\nuse stuff like Wireshark because it gives\n\n71\n00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,540\nthem a lot more control over the type\nof traffic they observe and and\n\n72\n00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,950\nhow they can filter it out and,\nand do all this other neat stuff.\n\n73\n00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,530\n>> Right.\n\n74\n00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,530\nExactly.\nWireshark has been around for\n\n75\n00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,952\na long time, it was Ethereal before\nthat so it's been around a while,\n\n76\n00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:58,460\nit's gone through a lot of, updates and\n\n77\n00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:02,572\nmodifications to where it really is\na very powerful, powerful sniffer.\n\n78\n00:04:02,572 --> 00:04:04,069\nIt's got just about\neverything we need in there.\n\n79\n00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,172\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And it is as Sean consist,\n\n80\n00:04:06,172 --> 00:04:11,322\nas Sean said, considered the, the best\nof breed when it comes to the sniffers.\n\n81\n00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:12,950\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n82\n00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,809\nYou know, I, I would also add in here\nat this point, is you know, I saw in,\n\n83\n00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:21,405\nin the discussion group here,\npacket analyzers\n\n84\n00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:21,980\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n85\n00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,129\n>> Packet analyzers,\nthat gets bounced around now and then too.\n\n86\n00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,977\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A packet analyzer, or,\n\n87\n00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,175\nor sometimes they call\nthem protocol analyzers,\n\n88\n00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:35,010\nis a protocol analyzers are a hardware,\nbased, tool.\n\n89\n00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:37,390\nAnd for the most part they're,\nthey're not,\n\n90\n00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,720\nthey're not something that\nyou're gonna encounter.\n\n91\n00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,592\nIf you're not already\nusing them in your job,\n\n92\n00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,616\nyou're probably never\ngonna use as a pen tester.\n\n93\n00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:47,448\nJust because they're, they're not pr,\nusually not practical, and not only that,\n\n94\n00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,404\nthey're not cheap.\n\n95\n00:04:48,404 --> 00:04:48,949\n>> Right.\n\n96\n00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,872\n>> So those protocol analyzers are,\nare $100,000, $200.000.\n\n97\n00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,720\nI've heard of ones that are 500 and\n$600,000.\n\n98\n00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,310\n>> Wow.\n\n99\n00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,300\n>> That are spec, very specific.\n\n100\n00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,025\nThey would pr, do things like\nfiber optic and stuff like that.\n\n101\n00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So they're very, they're very,\n\n102\n00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,630\nvery pricey.\n\n103\n00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,069\nYou're, unless you got\nextremely deep pockets,\n\n104\n00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,440\nthat's not something you're gonna\nhave as a you know, as a pen tester.\n\n105\n00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,831\n>> And you mentioned things like EtherApe,\nwhere we''re looking at the, not\n\n106\n00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:17,660\nnecessarily the, the data that's in the\npackets, but the type of packets visually.\n\n107\n00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,982\nSo if I'm just trying to shape traffic,\nor, or\n\n108\n00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:23,406\nget an idea of what type of protocols\nare being used on my network,\n\n109\n00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:28,240\nthose work pretty well, and lot less\nexpensive than a true, protocol analyzer.\n\n110\n00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,020\n>> Yeah, like you said,\nyou typically don't need to have\n\n111\n00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,510\nthat level of functionality for\nthe protocol analyzer.\n\n112\n00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,612\nYou know, protocol analyzers will be used\nfor analyzing stuff at the media level and\n\n113\n00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:39,880\nthe hardware eh, and\nthe low hardware level.\n\n114\n00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,855\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> For what we're doing here that's just,\n\n115\n00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:45,605\nthat's just not something that we're\ntypically going to be digging down in to.\n\n116\n00:05:45,605 --> 00:05:48,708\nIf you do then that's a different story,\nbut that's not a com,\n\n117\n00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,618\nthat's not a common one.You work for\na telecom company or something like that,\n\n118\n00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,280\nyou'll probably have access\nto those types of tools.\n\n119\n00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,700\nBut for the, for, for the,\nrest, the rest of us,\n\n120\n00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,590\nprobably no reason to ever even set hand,\nset hands on it or worry about it.\n\n121\n00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,050\n>> All right, so,\nI know what a sniffer is,\n\n122\n00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,880\nI know that it's going to be\ncapturing traffic on my network, so\n\n123\n00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,690\nI can just install it on my laptop here\nand see everybody's traffic, right?\n\n124\n00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,215\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n125\n00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:13,205\n>> That's, that's,\n\n126\n00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:14,085\nthat's pretty much it.\n[LAUGH]\n\n127\n00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:15,175\n>> There's a few things we\n\n128\n00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:15,895\ngotta do, right?\n>> Yes.\n\n129\n00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:16,965\n>> There's a few things that we have to\n\n130\n00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:18,875\nunderstand.\nCause you can't just go and,\n\n131\n00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,220\nput it on your laptop and see everything\nthat's going on on the network, right?\n\n132\n00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,230\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n133\n00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:27,790\nYou can install aniffer and\nyou can see traffic.\n\n134\n00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,210\nOh, if, if you just do that, but\nthere are some limitations, if,\n\n135\n00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,940\nif you, if you're unaware, if you're, if\nyou're not, aware of those things and work\n\n136\n00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,982\nwith them, you're gonna not gonna probably\nnot get the traffic that you want.\n\n137\n00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:40,750\nOh.\n>> [LAUGH] I'm the only one on\n\n138\n00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,740\nthe network, am I the only one\nthat's doing anything today?\n\n139\n00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,140\n>> I'm the only using the internet.\n\n140\n00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,880\n>> What the hell?\n[LAUGH]\n\n141\n00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,368\n>> There's ten people on Google and\n\n142\n00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:48,290\nI'm one, the one person on the internet.\n\n143\n00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,480\n>> And these people have\nbetter bandwidth than me so\n\n144\n00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,020\nthat's why I don't see their results.\n\n145\n00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,530\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n146\n00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,150\nSo when you do wait,\n\n147\n00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,550\nwhen you, that first requirement that you\nhave to have with the, with the sniffers,\n\n148\n00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:04,290\nyou have to have a, a network card that\nwill switch into promiscuous mode.\n\n149\n00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,480\n>> Promiscuous mode.\n\n150\n00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,640\nHm, what the heck is promiscuous\nmode on a network adapter?\n\n151\n00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,470\n>> Promis, promiscuous mode is very\nimportant key to this whole puzzle.\n\n152\n00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,920\nPromiscuous mode means that what you can\ndo is you can switch a network card into,\n\n153\n00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,955\nwhere it will just see traffic addressed\nto you, or leaving your station.\n\n154\n00:07:22,955 --> 00:07:24,180\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's gonna see\n\n155\n00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,975\neverything it happens to float by.\n\n156\n00:07:25,975 --> 00:07:27,130\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And that's important,\n\n157\n00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,980\nI mean if you're only seeing stuff\nthat goes to, from number two,\n\n158\n00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,460\nyou're gonna see, you know,\nwhat you're talking.\n\n159\n00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,500\nI'm the only one here, what's going on?\n\n160\n00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,672\nSo,\n>> [LAUGH] I captured my own password.\n\n161\n00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:35,219\nWahoo!\n>> Yeah!\n\n162\n00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:38,349\nI'm, I'm ahea- way ahead of the game.\n\n163\n00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:38,904\nYou know.\n\n164\n00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:39,527\nSo that, that,\n\n165\n00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,800\nthat's the thing is that you need to be\nable to switch into promiscuous mode.\n\n166\n00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,580\nAt one point in time you really had,\nkinda had to, you know look for\n\n167\n00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,175\na card associated with promiscuous mode.\n\n168\n00:07:49,175 --> 00:07:51,978\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And you know, EC counsel will say this.\n\n169\n00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:53,174\nOther sources will say this.\n\n170\n00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:55,693\nGo and make sure your card\nswitches into promiscuous mode.\n\n171\n00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:59,299\n>> I think the ones that don't\nswitch in promiscuous are more\n\n172\n00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:01,590\nthe exception to the rule now a days.\n\n173\n00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,769\n>> They are.\nI remember,\n\n174\n00:08:02,769 --> 00:08:06,201\nway back in the day you had to try\nto find like an Ornco chip set or\n\n175\n00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:10,168\nsomething like that on the network\nadapter to be able to change it over.\n\n176\n00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:12,898\nAnd now a days,\nmost of them can flip back and forth.\n\n177\n00:08:12,898 --> 00:08:15,601\nBecause remember,\nyou guys remember from your network plus,\n\n178\n00:08:15,601 --> 00:08:17,339\nEthernet is contention based, right?\n\n179\n00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,172\nThat means when you speak on Ethernet,\nthat signal goes out and\n\n180\n00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:22,801\nevery node that's on that subnet,\nhere's that signal.\n\n181\n00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:26,425\nBut normally, my network adapter\nis gonna ignore that signal,\n\n182\n00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:28,313\nif it's not my address, right?\n\n183\n00:08:28,313 --> 00:08:32,183\nIt's not for me, I'm just gonna ignore it,\nonly the destination address is gonna be\n\n184\n00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:34,191\nthe one that pays\nattention to that packet.\n\n185\n00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:37,887\nWe switch over to promiscuous mode and\nthen all of the sudden my network adapter\n\n186\n00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,239\nwill look at all those\npackets that are coming by,\n\n187\n00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,319\nnot just the ones that are addressed for\nme.\n\n188\n00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:45,486\nSo promiscuous mode needs to be able\nenabled on your network adapter,\n\n189\n00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:47,696\nif you really wanna sniff\nanything of interest.\n\n190\n00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:50,331\nWhich kinda brings us to the next point,\nright?\n\n191\n00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:54,353\nIs what traffic am I gonna see once\nI flip that over to promiscuous mode,\n\n192\n00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:56,845\na lot of that depends\non the network layout.\n\n193\n00:08:56,845 --> 00:08:58,421\n>> Yes, that does.\n\n194\n00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:02,761\nAnd that's gonna be a big stumbling block,\nif you're unaware of it.\n\n195\n00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:06,129\nNow if you know modern networks,\nyou're probably in good shape.\n\n196\n00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:10,827\nBut you still need to pay particular\nattention to the fact that,\n\n197\n00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:15,525\nwhether or not you're on a network\nthat has a hub, has a switch or\n\n198\n00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:21,271\nany sort of conductivity device between\nyou and what you're trying to sniff.\n\n199\n00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:25,463\nThe lowest common denominator you can\ndo is just sniff with a hub in place or\n\n200\n00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,096\nsomething similar to that.\n\n201\n00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:32,266\nIf you have a hub, a hub,\njust to go back to networking 101.\n\n202\n00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:33,294\nA hub is just a box.\n\n203\n00:09:33,294 --> 00:09:36,714\nWhat goes in one port,\ncomes out all the other ones.\n\n204\n00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:39,693\nIt doesn't get any simpler than that,\nit's a dumb device.\n\n205\n00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:44,012\nI mean, it doesn't do any sort of\nmanipulation or tweaking of the traffic.\n\n206\n00:09:44,012 --> 00:09:45,405\nOkay, fine.\n\n207\n00:09:45,405 --> 00:09:47,474\nNow if you have a sniffer net environment,\n\n208\n00:09:47,474 --> 00:09:50,014\nit will see anything that's\nconnected to that hub.\n\n209\n00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:50,641\nPeriod.\n\n210\n00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:51,744\nEnd of story.\n\n211\n00:09:51,744 --> 00:09:55,320\nSo, if you got one of those, pretty easy.\n\n212\n00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,269\n>> And when's the last time you went\ninto a network that was wired with hubs?\n\n213\n00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,464\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n214\n00:09:59,464 --> 00:10:00,300\n>> That doesn't happen all\n\n215\n00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,020\nthat often anymore.\n\n216\n00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,740\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n217\n00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,657\n>> You do see them.\n\n218\n00:10:02,657 --> 00:10:05,455\n>> Occasionally.\n>> But it's not that often anymore.\n\n219\n00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:09,892\n>> Only place I've seen one lately is\nif you get a room where you've only got\n\n220\n00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:13,062\none or two ports coming out of it that\nare feeding back to the closet and\n\n221\n00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:14,394\nyou need six nodes in there.\n\n222\n00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:18,024\nSo, I'll take one of those ports and\nI'll throw six nodes on a hub and\n\n223\n00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:21,163\ndo it that way, but\nI'll only see those six nodes, right?\n\n224\n00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,450\nBecause I still end up going back.\n\n225\n00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,144\nWell, I'll let give away the next part.\n\n226\n00:10:25,144 --> 00:10:27,940\nSo what's the next device up,\nwe have hub, dumb device,\n\n227\n00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,951\nI see all traffic coming out of all ports.\n\n228\n00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:33,167\n>> That's kind of funny what\nyou mention about hubs.\n\n229\n00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:37,095\nThe only person, the only time\nI've ran into hubs recently is so\n\n230\n00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,076\nI knew it was using for testing.\n\n231\n00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:42,546\nCompanies usually don't want hubs out\nthere, because of the security risk for\n\n232\n00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:44,533\ndoing stuff like we're talking about here.\n\n233\n00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:48,568\nSo hubs they will now\nswitches is better to,\n\n234\n00:10:48,568 --> 00:10:53,158\nas a minimum to do,\nthey will they'll use those.\n\n235\n00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:55,701\nBut just for the security risks,\njust get rid of, just get rid of hubs.\n\n236\n00:10:55,701 --> 00:10:58,634\nSo the last person I knew that\nhad it would, that had hubs and\n\n237\n00:10:58,634 --> 00:11:00,403\nthis was only about a year or so ago.\n\n238\n00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:01,762\nI ran into the person who had it.\n\n239\n00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:02,848\nHe was using them in a case,\n\n240\n00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:05,175\nwhere they had some sort of\nquestionable configuration.\n\n241\n00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:09,262\nIt was a switch doing it,\nwhereas a client having a problem.\n\n242\n00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:12,280\nAnd they would pull out the switch and\nput a hub in there just for testing.\n\n243\n00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,032\nBut after they were done with them,\nthey would lock them in a vault someplace.\n\n244\n00:11:15,032 --> 00:11:17,294\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> S no one else could use them for or\n\n245\n00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:18,396\nplug them in some place,\n\n246\n00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:21,870\nbecause they knew someone eventually\nwould if they left them sitting around.\n\n247\n00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,599\n>> It looks like a switch,\nI'll just put it in here.\n\n248\n00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,551\nAnd yeah, yeah.\n\n249\n00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,457\n>> Yeah, it works.\n\n250\n00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:26,838\nLook it, zero configuration.\n\n251\n00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:27,705\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] So\n\n252\n00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:31,018\nwhen we move up to our modern networks,\nwe are switched Ethernet,\n\n253\n00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:33,990\nwhich is typically what we're\ngoing to run into out there.\n\n254\n00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,531\nAt least, especially on the client end\nof things, the node end of things.\n\n255\n00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,735\nThe problem we run into here is we\nknow what a switch does, right?\n\n256\n00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:42,706\nThink back again to your Network Plus,\n\n257\n00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:46,900\nthe switch is creating that point to point\nconnection between you and that switch.\n\n258\n00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,859\nThe switch keeps a table\nwith all the MAC addresses.\n\n259\n00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,448\nWhat it learns and, right?\n\n260\n00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:56,004\nOver time it sees that traffic coming\ninto those ports and it says, oh,\n\n261\n00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,394\nthe source for\nthat packet is this MAC address.\n\n262\n00:11:58,394 --> 00:12:02,290\nI'm gonna write down a little table and it\ncan keep track of who's at what port and\n\n263\n00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,726\nthen as it learns that, when there's\ndestination traffic to be sent,\n\n264\n00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:08,962\nit only has to send it out to\nthe appropriate ports, not all ports.\n\n265\n00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,748\nRight, that's the advantage\nof a switch over a hub.\n\n266\n00:12:11,748 --> 00:12:14,900\nIt's a little bit smarter,\nworks up there at layer two.\n\n267\n00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,352\nSo it's looking at those\nphysical addresses and\n\n268\n00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:21,355\nit eliminates a lot of that traffic that\nmy computer used to have to deal with when\n\n269\n00:12:21,355 --> 00:12:22,749\nit was hooked up to the hub.\n\n270\n00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:25,689\nI'm only seeing stuff coming to me or\nleaving me,\n\n271\n00:12:25,689 --> 00:12:30,031\nbut if I'm capturing traffic,\nthat's not what I want either, isn't?\n\n272\n00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:32,385\n>> Yep, you want a little more than that.\n\n273\n00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:36,020\n>> Yeah, so when we're talking about\nswitches, what we gotta keep in mind is\n\n274\n00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,884\nthat we're really only, even if I put\nmy network adapter in promiscuous mode,\n\n275\n00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,386\nit's not my network adapter\nthat's limiting it.\n\n276\n00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:42,932\nRight?\n\n277\n00:12:42,932 --> 00:12:47,088\nIt's the switch that's only allowing\ncertain traffic to come out that port.\n\n278\n00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:50,924\nSo we need to do something to be able\nto see the rest of that traffic,\n\n279\n00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:52,783\nif we're hooked up to a switch.\n\n280\n00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:54,026\n>> Yeah.\n>> And we've got a few options, right?\n\n281\n00:12:54,026 --> 00:12:55,614\n>> Yeah, we do have a few options.\n\n282\n00:12:55,614 --> 00:12:59,154\nA switch is definitely gonna act like\nthat barrier that you have to deal with,\n\n283\n00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,068\nso the question is how\ndo you deal with it?\n\n284\n00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:02,968\n>> Well, to do this that,\n\n285\n00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:08,018\nyou kinda gotta understand some\nof the basics with the switch.\n\n286\n00:13:08,018 --> 00:13:09,549\nThere's a lot of things\ngoing on with the switch.\n\n287\n00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:12,102\nYes, it does keep track\nof Mac addresses and\n\n288\n00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:15,008\nregistries on it,\nthat's one big thing it does.\n\n289\n00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:20,256\nBut some things that we can think\nabout is before we even get to the Mac\n\n290\n00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:25,780\naddress part of it, some switches if\nyou can get physical access to it,\n\n291\n00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,106\nthey do have a SPAN port on it.\n\n292\n00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:32,630\nAnd a SPAN port you can configure to get\na copy of all the traffic that goes into\n\n293\n00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,336\nthat goes into that switch.\n\n294\n00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:37,998\nIf that's the, since that's the case,\nif you get physical access,\n\n295\n00:13:37,998 --> 00:13:40,851\nyou can plug this thing,\nyou can plug your device in and\n\n296\n00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:43,914\nstart sniffing everything that\ngoes to that that switch.\n\n297\n00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:44,704\nI mean, heck.\n\n298\n00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:47,826\nYou don't have to sit there\nwith your notebook and do that.\n\n299\n00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,893\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I showed you that, MiniPwner,\n\n300\n00:13:49,893 --> 00:13:53,517\nthat you guys were, I saw some of you\nguys asking what the name of it was that\n\n301\n00:13:53,517 --> 00:13:55,642\nlittle box I brought in, that MiniPwner.\n\n302\n00:13:55,642 --> 00:13:59,766\nYou can plug that thing in and\nit can start doing the sniffing for you.\n\n303\n00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:02,329\nThat device has a sniffer built into it.\n\n304\n00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:05,149\nSo what you ought to do is just,\nstick it up and\n\n305\n00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:09,323\nyou start sniffing traffic if you\ncan get access to that SPAN port.\n\n306\n00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:11,552\nIf that SPAN port isn't there or\n\n307\n00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:16,106\nyou can't get physical access\nto the device, you're not done.\n\n308\n00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,659\nThere are other mechanisms you can use.\n\n309\n00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:23,645\nFor that, we gotta understand what happens\nin the switch when it's recording all\n\n310\n00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,026\nthese MAC addresses.\n\n311\n00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:28,841\nIn a switch,\nwe have something called a CAM table,\n\n312\n00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:31,251\nwhich is just a chunk of memory.\n\n313\n00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:35,182\nNow the thing is that a memory,\nanywhere on a computer or\n\n314\n00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:38,454\nany place else holds\na finite amount of stuff.\n\n315\n00:14:38,454 --> 00:14:39,081\n>> Right.\n\n316\n00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:42,204\n>> Once it holds that finite\namount of stuff, that's it.\n\n317\n00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:46,361\nSo what happens is that when a normal\noperation starts going through,\n\n318\n00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,681\nit's keeping it's tables and\nall that stuff in there.\n\n319\n00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:54,424\nWhat we wanna do and this is called active\nsniffing, because the pass of sniffing is\n\n320\n00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:58,783\non a hub, we're not sticking our head up,\nnow we're sticking our head up.\n\n321\n00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:03,393\nWe're actually going to go and\nlaunch, essentially a denial\n\n322\n00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:08,013\nservice against the switch and\ntry and fill up that CAM table.\n\n323\n00:15:08,013 --> 00:15:14,035\nOnce we fill it up, depending on how the\nswitch has been configured or how old or\n\n324\n00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:19,598\nnew it is that switch could fail to\nan open state in which case it becomes or\n\n325\n00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:23,636\nacts, like a hub until\nthat pressure's released.\n\n326\n00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:26,964\nOther ones will fail closed,\nnewer ones tent to fail closed.\n\n327\n00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:31,356\nWhich is where, if you hit it like that,\nit's just gonna lock everything down till,\n\n328\n00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:35,138\nlet's see, till it's either cleared\non its own or someone comes back and\n\n329\n00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:37,715\nchecks it out and\nclears it themselves manually.\n\n330\n00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:38,249\n>> Yeah.\n\n331\n00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:42,291\n>> So they're being smarter about it, but\nshe still could find switches out there\n\n332\n00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,894\nthat are vulnerable to\nbeing pounded on like that.\n\n333\n00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:47,313\nBut you gotta think, if you pound on\nit like that, if they have an IDS or\n\n334\n00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,831\nsomething that's monitoring that network,\nthey're gonna see that.\n\n335\n00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:53,861\nYou've really stuck your head out, pretty\nfar and they're gonna wait to chop it off.\n\n336\n00:15:53,861 --> 00:15:54,523\n>> Right.\n\n337\n00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:57,406\nYou know, so you, you really gotta,\ngotta think about that.\n\n338\n00:15:57,406 --> 00:16:00,960\nAnd they have tools specifically built for\nthat.\n\n339\n00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,925\nIf you go into the D sniff suite,\nthey have one called mac-of.\n\n340\n00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They'll write into that.\n\n341\n00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,815\nAnd it's, it's mind numbing what it does.\n\n342\n00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:10,730\n>> [COUGH]\n>> The the mac-of utility is,\n\n343\n00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:17,110\nis capable of doing some of the order to\n120 to 140,000 MAC addresses every minute.\n\n344\n00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,560\nIt can blast out the network.\n\n345\n00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,670\nSo it can stomp all over your switch,\nand, and, shut it down.\n\n346\n00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,340\n>> Mm Hm.\n>> There's\n\n347\n00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,120\nones out there in experimental stages.\n\n348\n00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,110\nI can't give you more than that.\n\n349\n00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,580\nSo, so\n>> A lot of traffic.\n\n350\n00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,710\n>> Yeah, it is,\na tremendous amount of traffic and\n\n351\n00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,285\nyou can throttle that through\nthe configuration if you want.\n\n352\n00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,060\nMm-hm.\n\n353\n00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,130\n>> Now some other ones like either flood\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n354\n00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,740\n>> And there's,\nthere's an old one that still does work.\n\n355\n00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,080\nYou know?\nBut they're all doing the same thing.\n\n356\n00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,800\nThey're blasting a bunch\nof MAC addresses to it.\n\n357\n00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,310\nOnce you open up the switch like that\nthen it's just a matter of just of,\n\n358\n00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,120\nof just doing your sniffing process.\n\n359\n00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,365\nSo it's a bit, you're doing at\nleast two stages to the attack.\n\n360\n00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:54,080\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n361\n00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,620\n>> go after the switch\n>> And then do your sniffing, you know,\n\n362\n00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,510\nso that's just kind a, that's just kind\na how that would, that would work.\n\n363\n00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,280\n>> Okay, so, yeah, so, that, that,\n\n364\n00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,940\nthat switch again has that limited amount\nof memory, or finite amount of memory.\n\n365\n00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,150\nlet's store that cam table and if I can\nflood it with more information than it can\n\n366\n00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,020\nput in that table,\nit doesn't know what to do.\n\n367\n00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,060\nIt can't keep track of what MAC addresses\nare coming on a different ports and\n\n368\n00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,390\nthen the switch has one or two options.\n\n369\n00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,620\nIt can fail open, meaning I give up.\n\n370\n00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,030\ni'm just going turn into a hub and send\nit out all ports or it can fail closed,\n\n371\n00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,530\nmeaning it's I give up.\n\n372\n00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,570\nI shut down until somebody fixes me.\n\n373\n00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:33,500\nBut cuz so that's one of the ways\nthat we can [INAUDIBLE] tr,\n\n374\n00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,700\nstart sniffing traffic that wasn't\ndestiny, destined for our computer in\n\n375\n00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,630\na switched environment, is to get that\nswitch to kind of act like a hub instead.\n\n376\n00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,490\nOr use, as you said, that,\nthat monitoring, that mirroring port.\n\n377\n00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,020\nYou used a different name for\nit, what'd you call it?\n\n378\n00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,540\n>> SPAN port.\n\n379\n00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,890\n>> That SPAN port.\n\n380\n00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,410\nYou know, that's just a port that\nIt's a lot of times set up for\n\n381\n00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,540\nmanagement purposes, right.\n\n382\n00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,360\nI mean that's what it's there for.\n\n383\n00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,420\n>> Exactly.\nIt's a management interface.\n\n384\n00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,760\n>> Yeah.\nSo if I'm the management on that network,\n\n385\n00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,890\nI can go in and\nplug a computer into that, and\n\n386\n00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,250\nI can see what all my\nsales people are doing.\n\n387\n00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:05,670\nAre they actually going to work leader\nwebsites, or are they on Facebook and\n\n388\n00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,560\nthings like that what traffic is going on.\n\n389\n00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,930\nSo it's a design for management interface.\n\n390\n00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,790\nBut as a bad guy I can take advantage of\nthat because it basically is switches\n\n391\n00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,870\neverything I send out, I'm gonna\nsend a copy out this port over here.\n\n392\n00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,820\nSo if you're hooked up to\nthat port you see it all.\n\n393\n00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,320\nAnd with Shaun's little device, I mean,\n\n394\n00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,960\nyou can slip in there,\nplug that in and be gone.\n\n395\n00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,050\nAnd sit at home and wait and\npop yourself a bowl of popcorn and\n\n396\n00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,340\njust read all that data.\n\n397\n00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,008\n>> Just, yeah, just, just wait,\njust wait, it's all, it's all,\n\n398\n00:18:33,008 --> 00:18:34,390\nit's a waiting game at that point.\n\n399\n00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:34,890\n>> Yeah.\n\n400\n00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,997\n>> It, it, it taught,\n\n401\n00:18:35,997 --> 00:18:40,668\nit, it speaks to something that was that\nwas mentioned over over some of our mod,\n\n402\n00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:45,140\nour previous modules in here is that\n>> If I get physical access to\n\n403\n00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,100\nsomething in there.\n\n404\n00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,631\nI own it now.\n\n405\n00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:49,020\n>> Mm hm.\n>> You know this is just another example\n\n406\n00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:54,710\nthat I'm able to get physical access to\nto, to your wiring closet or something.\n\n407\n00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,216\nI can shove in one of those many or\nwhatever.\n\n408\n00:18:58,216 --> 00:19:00,730\n>> Like that, you're done.\n\n409\n00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,570\n>> Yeah, but I like it.\n\n410\n00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,350\nIf I can touch your computer,\nit's no longer your computer.\n\n411\n00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,590\nI just love that saying.\n\n412\n00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,820\nI think it was the Ten Immutable Laws of\nSecurity that Microsoft published a long\n\n413\n00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,440\ntime ago.\n\n414\n00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,100\nAnd you might think,\n\n415\n00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,600\nwell how the heck could anybody ever\nget access to my switchboard, or\n\n416\n00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,670\nmy wiring closet, right?\n\n417\n00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,340\nWell, it could be somebody\ndoing social engineering,\n\n418\n00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,880\nlooking like a repairman of some kind lot\nof times we're in shared environments\n\n419\n00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,240\nwhere I'm not the only tenant that\nhas access to that switch closet.\n\n420\n00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,980\nOr that, that wiring closet do I have, do\nI trust all the other people you know so\n\n421\n00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,020\nthere's a lot of different ways\nsomebody could gain access to that.\n\n422\n00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,860\n>> Yeah it, it's, it's, it's, it,\nthere's definitely a l, a l, l,\n\n423\n00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,140\nlike saying there's a lot of\nways that someone could get.\n\n424\n00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:48,400\nCould get into that server room\nCompanies are not really the best\n\n425\n00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,490\nat patrolling those,\nat least I have found.\n\n426\n00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,080\nI have seen some crazy ones\nthe way people got into it.\n\n427\n00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,440\nI actually had a colleague\nof mine do this year ago,\n\n428\n00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,250\nwhere he was doing, it was doing\non-site assessment, on-site thing,\n\n429\n00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,780\nin somebody, in this company's server\nroom, and the server room had like a big\n\n430\n00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,020\narch which you walked under to go into,\nno door or anything on it.\n\n431\n00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,032\n>> Okay, [CROSSTALK] as soon as\nyou said arch, I was like \"Okay,\n\n432\n00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:16,176\nthey don't have that secured.\"\n>> Yeah, pretty much.\n\n433\n00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:19,567\n[LAUGH] So he said it was right next\nto the receptionist's office, and\n\n434\n00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:23,030\nhe told them did you surely have a guard\nor something in here to do this?\n\n435\n00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,500\nAnd I said, oh yeah, that's a good idea.\n\n436\n00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,380\nNext day, he comes in.\n\n437\n00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,730\nThey have one there.\n\n438\n00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:28,030\nHis name's not on the list.\n\n439\n00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,910\nAnd so he couldn't get in.\n\n440\n00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,460\nAnd they said oh well you need\nto have someone vouch for you.\n\n441\n00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,490\nHe says oh yeah, the guy should be in.\n\n442\n00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,270\nHe's around the corner.\n\n443\n00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,990\nHe says, but I can't go back\nthere because I don't have,\n\n444\n00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,510\nbecause I don't want to ruin\nyour security guard set.\n\n445\n00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,540\nOkay I'll go check.\n\n446\n00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,960\nAnd put the clipboard down.\n\n447\n00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,130\nAnd walked around the corner.\n\n448\n00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,870\nAnd my friend picked up the clipboard.\n\n449\n00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,640\nwrote his name on it,\nand put it back down.\n\n450\n00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,350\nHe said, can you check one more time\nto see if my name's on that list?\n\n451\n00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,600\nAnd he's like, okay, and he goes, I don't\nthink I missed it, but he goes, oh hey,\n\n452\n00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,360\nyou are on here.\n\n453\n00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,220\nHe says, you can go.\n\n454\n00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,230\nHe says, thanks.\n\n455\n00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,220\nWalked right in so [LAUGH]\n]\n\n456\n00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,930\nthat's just an awful\n-- it's a funny story.\n\n457\n00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:06,320\nIt's an awfully funny story,\nbut, you know.\n\n458\n00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,410\n>> Wrong on so many levels.\n\n459\n00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,280\n>> Yeah yeah.\n\n460\n00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,630\nWhat, what can you really say\nabout that at that point.\n\n461\n00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,570\nIt's, there's so\nmany levels of wrong happening there.\n\n462\n00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,980\nBut it, it, it, it's far from being the,\n\n463\n00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,840\nthat's far from being the only place\nwhere something like that has happened.\n\n464\n00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,340\n>> Right.\n>> You know.\n\n465\n00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,630\nSo you know, once that guy got in there.\n\n466\n00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,900\nYeah, he, he was able to get past\nthe security guard and get right in.\n\n467\n00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,870\nHe owns that place now.\n\n468\n00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,880\nIf he had any malicious stuff in mind,\nit would have been done.\n\n469\n00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,440\n>> It's that easy.\n\n470\n00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,240\nIt's that easy.\n\n471\n00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,220\nAlright so, you know,\nwhen we look at sniffing again,\n\n472\n00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,330\nwe, we,\nwe understand now what sniffing is.\n\n473\n00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,170\nWe're gonna go out and\ntry to capture Packets or\n\n474\n00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,730\nthe data that's traveling across\nthe network either for observation or, or\n\n475\n00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,730\nworse depending on what\nwe're trying to do.\n\n476\n00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,690\nAnd we understand some of\nthe requirements that we need ta,\n\n477\n00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,700\nta do this sniffing successfully.\n\n478\n00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,398\nPromiscuous mode.\n\n479\n00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:55,930\nThe network adapt-or has to be able to\nbe Switched over to promiscuous mode,\n\n480\n00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,470\nwhich I'm informed you know most of\nthem nowadays are able to do that.\n\n481\n00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,010\nAnd we need to have a connection,\nwe need to be able to get in between,\n\n482\n00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,850\nbasically, the conversation.\n\n483\n00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,390\nAlright?\nI mean that's really what it comes down to\n\n484\n00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:07,490\nif you think about it.\n\n485\n00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:08,460\nA switched environment.\n\n486\n00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,370\nI've got that point-to-point connection\nbetween me and the switch so,\n\n487\n00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,940\nI only see my traffic and\nnobody else sees my traffic.\n\n488\n00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,740\nSo we need to do something to that switch\nto get some of that traffic to flow out\n\n489\n00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,780\nthe port we're connected to,\n\n490\n00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:25,135\nwhich could be some type of\nattack against the switch itself.\n\n491\n00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,415\nTo where we try to get it to\njust flood it with information\n\n492\n00:22:28,415 --> 00:22:31,545\nwhere it can't do it's normal job and\nit fails open.\n\n493\n00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:34,385\nOr we might take advantage if\nwe've got physical access,\n\n494\n00:22:34,385 --> 00:22:38,760\nwe might be able to take advantage of\nlike a monitoring or management port.\n\n495\n00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,170\nThat's built into that switch.\n\n496\n00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,800\nAlright, so I don't know if we want\nWe want to fire up the sniffer here.\n\n497\n00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,830\nWe've just got a few more\nminutes in this segment.\n\n498\n00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,310\nDo you want to start or\ndo you want to go ahead and\n\n499\n00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:51,760\nwrap this up and save that for\nthe next one, I think?\n\n500\n00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,910\n>> Yeah, next one, yeah.\n\n501\n00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,880\n>> Let's do that.\nAlright then,\n\n502\n00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,800\nwe're going to keep you\non the edge of your seat.\n\n503\n00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,550\nWhen we come back we're gonna\nfire up one of these sniffers and\n\n504\n00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,900\nsee what kind of fun stuff we can see.\n\n505\n00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,790\nStay tuned.\n\n506\n00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,545\nWe'll be right back.\n\n507\n00:23:03,545 --> 00:23:09,680\n[SOUND]\nAlright.\n\n508\n00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,650\nWelcome back, ladies and gentleman.\n\n509\n00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,630\nSo, continuing on with\nour sniffer chapter,\n\n510\n00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:17,350\nwe're gonna take a look now at one of the,\nthe what did you call it,\n\n511\n00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,760\nthe, the best in the breed, of sniffers,\nwhich is good, old Wire Shark.\n\n512\n00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,700\nSo, we're gonna file it up, and show you\nguys what sniffing package is all about.\n\n513\n00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,430\n>> Yeah.\nWire Shark is one of those, is,\n\n514\n00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,710\nis one of those things that really is\nthe best of breed in this category.\n\n515\n00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,520\nThat's why most people use sniffer,\nthis is the one they are going to use.\n\n516\n00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,168\nLike I said doesn't mean\nyou can't use another one,\n\n517\n00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:46,907\ndoesn't mean you are stuck\nto using this one.\n\n518\n00:23:46,907 --> 00:23:51,829\nI would tell you for CH purposes this is\nthe one that you'd spend some time face\n\n519\n00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:53,753\ntime with and get used to.\n\n520\n00:23:53,753 --> 00:23:57,684\nAfter, you know, after that, you wanna\nuse a different type of sniffer for\n\n521\n00:23:57,684 --> 00:24:00,030\nwhatever reason, you know, I don't care.\n\n522\n00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:00,870\nGo ahead.\nUse it.\n\n523\n00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,810\nWhatever you, whatever you feel is,\nis the most appropriate for you to use and\n\n524\n00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,170\nyou're most comfortable with.\n\n525\n00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,400\nBut this is the one they tend to tend to,\ntend to use.\n\n526\n00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,580\nAnd you're gonna see Wireshark,\nnot just here, but\n\n527\n00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,825\nyou're also gonna see it again in\nour wireless chapter when we talk.\n\n528\n00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:16,960\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> About, a bit about, you know,\n\n529\n00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,390\ndoing stuff on the wireless side.\n\n530\n00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,106\nBut, you know\n>> Yeah, so, it's a, its a, mul,\n\n531\n00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:25,034\nit's used in multiple areas\n>> In other words,\n\n532\n00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:28,590\ndownload it, install it, run it,\nplay with it, get familiar with it.\n\n533\n00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,525\nDon't use just the GUI,\nuse the command line interface as well.\n\n534\n00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:34,490\nBecause you might see a question or\ntwo on the exam, that deal with,\n\n535\n00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,440\ndeal with you know Wireshark being\nthe one they'll to call out,\n\n536\n00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,750\nif they are going to ask you\nanything about sniffers.\n\n537\n00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,540\n>> Yeah so, yeah you've gotta get,\n\n538\n00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,200\nyou've gotta get really fluent\nyou know with Wireshark.\n\n539\n00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,695\nFortunately, if you've been through,\nyou know, if, if you've been through any\n\n540\n00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:53,510\nWireshark training, I know we've got\none here at IT Pro if you, or if\n\n541\n00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:57,860\nyou use it already you're, you're already\npr, you're already in pretty good shape.\n\n542\n00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,320\nThe thing you have to be aware of is,\nis just how to read it, and\n\n543\n00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,700\nwhat specifically you're looking for\nas it relates to ethical hacking.\n\n544\n00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,330\nAnd so we're gonna show you\nsome of that as we go through.\n\n545\n00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,330\nSo what you see on screen,\nthis is a Wireshark.\n\n546\n00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,160\nI've already done a capture,\nand I stopped it.\n\n547\n00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,000\nYou know, just to kinda,\njust to kinda give us a quick, you know,\n\n548\n00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,800\nsnapshot of stuff that had happened.\n\n549\n00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,770\nIt caught this in a very,\nvery short period of time.\n\n550\n00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:28,330\nYou know, I, you know, I, I can move this\nscroll bar, you know, you know, back and\n\n551\n00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:28,891\nforth on here.\n\n552\n00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:30,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can see it caught a lot in\n\n553\n00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,970\na very short period of time.\n\n554\n00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,250\nI didn't have this running for like an\nhour or ten minutes or anything like that.\n\n555\n00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:42,043\nThis was running for probably, you know,\nyou know, about a minute, two minutes.\n\n556\n00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:42,600\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> So\n\n557\n00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,000\nthis a reasonably active you know,\na pretty good active network.\n\n558\n00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,920\nYou know, what I would expect.\n\n559\n00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:53,408\nYou know, so, yeah, you, you, you,\nyou look at it and you can see, you know,\n\n560\n00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,569\nkinda, you know, sink,\nthings that are going on.\n\n561\n00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:01,166\nHere you can see that we have, you know,\nit, it's, it's got where it came from,\n\n562\n00:26:01,166 --> 00:26:02,360\nwhere it's going to.\n\n563\n00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,810\nYou know, you need to be able to,\nto, to read that.\n\n564\n00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,825\nThen we see the, this, this, this,\nthis call and receive at the protocol.\n\n565\n00:26:08,825 --> 00:26:09,710\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n566\n00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,820\n>> And then you see when you go over to,\nwe can skip over the length and\n\n567\n00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,590\ngo over the info tab.\n\n568\n00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,361\nThe info or the info column,\n\n569\n00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:20,170\nthe info column is really giving us quite\na bit of information over there, too.\n\n570\n00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,980\nYou know.\n\n571\n00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,610\nSo, if we are to go through and we start,\nyou know, examining this, you know,\n\n572\n00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,580\nwhat's the, you know, what's of interest?\n\n573\n00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,240\nWell, first of all, we do, we talked\nabout earlier this week, we talked about,\n\n574\n00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,685\nyou know, knowing your protocols.\n\n575\n00:26:31,685 --> 00:26:32,480\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> You know, you,\n\n576\n00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,790\nyou're gonna have to know your protocols,\nso you can very quickly see this is TCP.\n\n577\n00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:39,430\nOne of the things Wireshark\nwill do quite easily for\n\n578\n00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:43,215\nyou to visualize it will tell you,\nyou know, what protocol something's using.\n\n579\n00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:44,470\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n580\n00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,980\n>> Now, if you know it is TCP protocol,\nif you look over on the info column,\n\n581\n00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,340\nyou know,\nyou can kind of read some details with it.\n\n582\n00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,336\nAnd if you wanted to crack open\nany one of these Individual in,\n\n583\n00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:59,820\none of these individual items you can\nactually, you know, go down here and\n\n584\n00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,730\nexpand, you know, pretty much everything\nout for any specific, you know frame or\n\n585\n00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,165\nwhatever you want to take a look at.\n\n586\n00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,470\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If that's, if that's your goal.\n\n587\n00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:13,050\nA lot of that tends to be abo, you know,\nabove what we do for C, for CEH but\n\n588\n00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,260\nyou can actually do it.\n\n589\n00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,860\n>> You know, I notice Mike you put\nup the Wireshock.org slash docs.\n\n590\n00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,600\n>> Hm, hm.\n>> That's a very good url.\n\n591\n00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,360\n>> Hm, hm.\n>> You know, for, for those to refer to,\n\n592\n00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:29,220\nand so things to kind of,\nlike I said, things to pay\n\n593\n00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,782\nattention to during sniffing, if you're\ndoing things like the SMTP, protocol.\n\n594\n00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:34,510\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n595\n00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,940\n>> And it's unsecured, you will see that\nthe protocol is SMTP, and you can move\n\n596\n00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,760\nover and you could see well if it's a, you\ncan actually see if it's secured or not.\n\n597\n00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,327\nIt'll show up\n>> I didn't have any an, an,\n\n598\n00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:49,091\nan, SMTP connections going across here,\nnor would I show you if I did.\n\n599\n00:27:49,091 --> 00:27:51,745\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, I know who I'm dealing with.\n\n600\n00:27:51,745 --> 00:27:52,590\nAll right so [LAUGH],\n>> And\n\n601\n00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,253\nyou know this is probably a really\ngood time to throw in a little bit of\n\n602\n00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:58,574\ndisclaimer here that I forgot to mention\nat the beginning of this, love Wireshark,\n\n603\n00:27:58,574 --> 00:27:59,587\nlove sniffing packets.\n\n604\n00:27:59,587 --> 00:28:03,714\nI think it's a great way for people to\nlearn Some of the basics of networking,,\n\n605\n00:28:03,714 --> 00:28:07,655\nyou know getting under the hood, and\nlearn much more than what we saw in say,\n\n606\n00:28:07,655 --> 00:28:09,405\nat Net+ or something like that.\n\n607\n00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:12,860\nBecause you're seeing the protocols like,\nwe talked about the three way handshake.\n\n608\n00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,540\nYou'll see that in there, you'll see\nthe syn, the synac and the ack packets.\n\n609\n00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,500\nWell you guys have probably\nlearned about DHCP and, and\n\n610\n00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,880\nyou'll see the discover, the offer, the\nrequest, the acknowledgement you know and\n\n611\n00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,430\nthat kinda thing.\n\n612\n00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,770\nAnd you'll see the queries\nthat are being sent to DNS.\n\n613\n00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,685\nAnd if somebody is sending an email And\nit's not secure, which most of the time,\n\n614\n00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:32,605\nit's not, you can actually read the email.\n\n615\n00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:33,735\nWhich leads me to my,\n\n616\n00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:38,255\nmy disclaimer, make sure that you're not\nviolating any policies when you do this.\n\n617\n00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:40,760\nYou know, I know we talk about\nwhat an ethical hacker is and\n\n618\n00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,930\nthen we have permissions.\n\n619\n00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,606\nWhat people will forget sometimes is,\n\n620\n00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:46,360\nI'm at work, and\nthese guys are talking about Wireshark.\n\n621\n00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,688\nAnd I'm just gonna download it real quick,\nput it on my, my computer here,\n\n622\n00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:51,588\nand start capturing packets.\n\n623\n00:28:51,588 --> 00:28:54,140\nYou've got the potential to see things\nthat you shouldn't be seeing, all right.\n\n624\n00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,860\nThey might not be encrypting those emails,\nbut\n\n625\n00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,623\nthey're assuming nobody\nis sniffing packets.\n\n626\n00:28:57,623 --> 00:29:01,638\nSo I guess the point is that you might\nviolate your company policies by running\n\n627\n00:29:01,638 --> 00:29:03,876\nsomething like this on a company network.\n\n628\n00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:06,870\nEspecially if it's any type of\nfinancial or healthcare network or\n\n629\n00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:07,890\nsomething like that.\n\n630\n00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,570\nSo, word of caution, you know,\n\n631\n00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,930\nmake sure that you're doing this\nin a controlled environment.\n\n632\n00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,270\nThat you have permission like we talked\nabout was being an ethical hacker.\n\n633\n00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:19,260\nAnd you're not just doing it without\nconsent from the network admins.\n\n634\n00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,970\n>> Yeah, good call on that.\n\n635\n00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,580\nIt's that yeah don't ever, d,\ndon't ever decide that, you know,\n\n636\n00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,830\nyou're going to run a sniffer on your\ncorporate network just because you need\n\n637\n00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:29,690\nto practice with it or,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n638\n00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,930\n>> you know, for whatever reason.\n\n639\n00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:35,735\nYou stand a very good chance of getting\ncaught under the right conditions.\n\n640\n00:29:35,735 --> 00:29:37,530\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> There are ways to detect this,\n\n641\n00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,611\neven passively there are ways\nto detect it and it's gonna,\n\n642\n00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:42,460\nit's gonna raise a lot of questions.\n\n643\n00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:45,480\nI mean, you could be seeing something\nthat you're not supposed to see.\n\n644\n00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,060\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n645\n00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,630\nCause they could have NTSF permissions\ncontrolling access to that file but\n\n646\n00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,540\nwhen that's in, and\nit could even be in an encrypted file, but\n\n647\n00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,120\nwhen that's being transmitted across\nthe network, EFS is part of NTFS so\n\n648\n00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,860\nit's decrypted,\nsent across the network and\n\n649\n00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,210\nthen encrypted again on the other end\nwhen it gets back an NTFS partition.\n\n650\n00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,108\nSo it's plain text there.\n\n651\n00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:04,120\nYou're sniffing traffic.\n\n652\n00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,170\nYou could capture that stuff,\nand, and yeah, like you say,\n\n653\n00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,360\nget in a lot of trouble\nwith your own company.\n\n654\n00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,280\nJust cuz you're playing and,\nand thinking it's harmless,\n\n655\n00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,270\nyou're not meaning to doing anything, but\nthat could get you in a lot of trouble.\n\n656\n00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:17,290\nJust a word of caution,\nbe careful with these sniffers, love em.\n\n657\n00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,890\nYou really need to get in there and\nplay with them.\n\n658\n00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,617\nMake sure you do it appropriately so\nyou don't get yourself in trouble.\n\n659\n00:30:21,617 --> 00:30:26,400\n>> Yeah if your going to use it on your\ncorporate network it's, it's, it's not as,\n\n660\n00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,895\nnot as bad as it would be if you went\nfull ethical hacker in that case.\n\n661\n00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And start poking around.\n\n662\n00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,280\nBut you should still check\nto see if you've got\n\n663\n00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,215\nif you have permission to do this before,\nbefore you start doing anything.\n\n664\n00:30:39,215 --> 00:30:42,700\nYou do it on your a home network,\nthen you're gonna go ahead and have that.\n\n665\n00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,806\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Could care less if you do it there.\n\n666\n00:30:44,806 --> 00:30:46,240\n>> Right.\n>> Corporate network,\n\n667\n00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,860\nI know of cases where people\nhave gotten not just fired,\n\n668\n00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,490\nthey've had charges pressed against them.\n\n669\n00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:51,060\n>> Really.\n\n670\n00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,396\n>> So, it is not something that\njust oh well I'm going to go ahead,\n\n671\n00:30:54,396 --> 00:30:55,440\nwell it's harmless.\n\n672\n00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,590\n>> Hm-mm.\n>> No, it's not harmless and y,\n\n673\n00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,400\nyou can pretty much count on that you,\n\n674\n00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,245\nyou pretty much assume that\nyou're going to get caught.\n\n675\n00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:03,120\n>> Yeah.\n>> You may not but\n\n676\n00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,840\nassume that you're going to get caught and\n\n677\n00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,155\nsomeone's going to ask some questions\nabout why you're doing that.\n\n678\n00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:08,150\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n679\n00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,650\n>> And if you don't have permission\nthere's really not a good answer.\n\n680\n00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,810\n>> Right\n>> You know, so, just, just FYI.\n\n681\n00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,990\n>> They're studying for CEH I don't\nthink that's gonna fly [LAUGH].\n\n682\n00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:17,490\n>> Yeah.\n\n683\n00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,623\nYeah, Fabian asked a question here,\nsays sniffer only captures packets that go\n\n684\n00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:24,640\nthrough the NIC installed in\nthe computer or the entire network?\n\n685\n00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,385\nIt can do ei, i,it can,\ni,it can be either.\n\n686\n00:31:28,385 --> 00:31:33,740\nBy read, if I if I read this\nquestion right, you can set it up so\n\n687\n00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,850\nit only reads stuff that goes to and\nfrom your computer, you know, or\n\n688\n00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,434\nyou can set it up so it's picking\nup stuff for the whole network.\n\n689\n00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:43,282\n>> Hmm.\n>> You know by default, when you look at,\n\n690\n00:31:43,282 --> 00:31:48,146\nyou know, like I've got Wireshark\nup here you know, you know, turn,\n\n691\n00:31:48,146 --> 00:31:53,086\nI got Wireshark on screen you'll see\nthat it's allowing me to you know,\n\n692\n00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:58,560\nto look at my to, to choose the connection\nI want to Sniff on, you know, up here.\n\n693\n00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,669\nBut then you'll see at the right,\n\n694\n00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:06,540\nright here you'll see a button that says\nuse promiscuous mode on all interfaces.\n\n695\n00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,205\nIf I go and.\n\n696\n00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:09,745\ngo ahead and I use that.\n\n697\n00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:12,685\nWhat's going to happen is that\nit will observe everything\n\n698\n00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:14,045\nthat goes back and forth.\n\n699\n00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:18,775\nSo you that's, so\nit'll monitor everything in the network,\n\n700\n00:32:18,775 --> 00:32:20,670\nregardless of its address\nto this machine or not.\n\n701\n00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:25,215\nAnd so,\nonce you have that button tweaked, and\n\n702\n00:32:25,215 --> 00:32:29,537\nyou go ahead and click on a button, click\non one of the interfaces and click start,\n\n703\n00:32:29,537 --> 00:32:34,142\nIt should,\nstart collecting information so,\n\n704\n00:32:34,142 --> 00:32:38,255\nthere you have that's actually\nlive traffic right now.\n\n705\n00:32:38,255 --> 00:32:44,240\n>> So I can stop that at any time and\nyou can see when you're looking at this,\n\n706\n00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,930\njust FYI there's some\nstuff you can see in here.\n\n707\n00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,210\nThere's some of our flags\nthat are being set, remember?\n\n708\n00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:54,090\nOr early on we're talking,\nlast week we were going through stuff,\n\n709\n00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,200\nwe talking about different\ntypes of flags for scanning.\n\n710\n00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,510\nYou know, there you go,\nthere's a bunch of ACK flags going across.\n\n711\n00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,880\n>> Right.\n>> So you could really, see, as Mike said,\n\n712\n00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,530\nyou can see the three, you can actually\nsee the three-way handshake in there,\n\n713\n00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,200\nif you, if you're\n>> If you're lucky enough to capture some,\n\n714\n00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,270\ncapture the right traffic, you'll see\nthe syn and the syn ack and the ack.\n\n715\n00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,760\n>> And you can see it right there which\nactually brings me to when you look at\n\n716\n00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,450\nsomething like this on screen, that info\ncolumn what you want to pay attention to\n\n717\n00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,415\nin there is, which way the flags are going\nand the back and forth and all that.\n\n718\n00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:32,160\nBecause in what order, if you see flags\nin different orders, what that means\n\n719\n00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,970\nis because it's not going to be impossible\nthat you could go into your exam and see\n\n720\n00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:42,470\nan exhibit like this, and see a whole page\nof a whole snippet of a packet capture.\n\n721\n00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,510\nAnd they could say what type\nof attack is taking place.\n\n722\n00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,420\n>> Right.\n>> It may sound like a really\n\n723\n00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:51,290\ndaunting task, initially,\nif you haven't had to do it before.\n\n724\n00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,290\n>> But it's, all of you got this, really.\n\n725\n00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:54,390\n>> Yeah.\n>> You all got this.\n\n726\n00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:00,680\nBecause we went through scanning and\nwe talked about different ways scans work.\n\n727\n00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,020\nAnd you can see those flags show up there.\n\n728\n00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,140\nSo, all you have to do is,\njust look at the pattern of the flags, and\n\n729\n00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:10,810\nsee what that means to you, and you can\ntell right away, that person's doing a fin\n\n730\n00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:15,150\nscanner, or doing ax scan,\nor to have, you will see it.\n\n731\n00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:15,900\n>> Okay.\nPop quiz for\n\n732\n00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,690\nyou guys out there in the chat room\nwatching live, so, if I see a syn packet\n\n733\n00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,875\ngoing out from an address and then a syn\nack coming back, and then I see another\n\n734\n00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:27,310\nsyn packet going out from that same\naddress, and then a syn act coming back.\n\n735\n00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,550\nAnd, then another syn packet going out,\nand a syn act coming back, you know,\n\n736\n00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,610\nwhat are we looking at?\n\n737\n00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,192\n>> Pop quiz, tough guy.\n\n738\n00:34:33,192 --> 00:34:34,820\n>> All right, so\nI'll give you guys a few minutes,\n\n739\n00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,840\nI know there's a little\nbit of delay there, so.\n\n740\n00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,750\nA type that in the chat room when\nyou get the answer to that one.\n\n741\n00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,990\nSo a lot of great information\nnow being made available, but\n\n742\n00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:45,240\nthat's different, you know, I'm a geek.\n\n743\n00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,240\nWhat better to do on a Friday night\nthan sit around and read traffic, right?\n\n744\n00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,620\nAnd look at flags on TCPI Feedback.\n\n745\n00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,890\nI mean, come on.\n\n746\n00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:51,750\nIs it getting better now Shawn?\n\n747\n00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,500\n>> Yeah, it does, sorry.\n\n748\n00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,698\nI can't follow you into\nthe light on that one.\n\n749\n00:34:58,698 --> 00:35:00,076\n>> You're lame.\n\n750\n00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:02,710\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's me hanging you out to dry.\n\n751\n00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,360\n>> Oh yeah it is.\n\n752\n00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,198\nI'm just swinging in the wind now man.\n\n753\n00:35:06,198 --> 00:35:10,300\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nwhat else do we need to know.\n\n754\n00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300\nYou know, we've taken a look.\n\n755\n00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,290\nWe talked about this is wire sharp, so\n\n756\n00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,395\nyou've got to pick your network adapter\nthat you want to capture the traffic on\n\n757\n00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:18,390\nbecause you might have more\nthan one in that system.\n\n758\n00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:21,880\nYou want to check your options but\nit should be set to promiscuous mode.\n\n759\n00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,880\n, if it's not, you can turn that on\nbecause you're not trying to capture\n\n760\n00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,120\njust the traffic destined\nto your network mode or\n\n761\n00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,850\njust destined to your\nnetwork adaptor most likely.\n\n762\n00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:36,465\n>> And then we've got\n>> Port scans, we've got syn floods.\n\n763\n00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:42,310\nand, we could say that is a close.\n\n764\n00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,730\nI mean is the syn flood,\nit would be, I would accept that of,\n\n765\n00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,280\nas an answer, I think.\n\n766\n00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,890\nIt really was a half open scan, right?\n\n767\n00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:51,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or a stealth scan.\n\n768\n00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,920\nThere we go, Mike Mikeayla put\nit in there, the old dash ss.\n\n769\n00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,887\nSo, yeah, TCP had-\n>> Extra credit.\n\n770\n00:35:57,887 --> 00:36:02,110\n>> [LAUGH] And\nthe attack based on that type of scan\n\n771\n00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,910\nis also being answered in the chat room\nthere, because I know if you're watching\n\n772\n00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,510\nthe recording,\nyou're going to have the chat room.\n\n773\n00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,780\nSo we got a few answers there,\nsyn flood, port scan.\n\n774\n00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,280\nthe dash SS,\nwhen we're talking about N map,\n\n775\n00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,760\nas the using N map as our scanner,\nand that would be the one.\n\n776\n00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,185\nThe TCP half open or the dash SS, and then\na syn flood, which I think we talked about\n\n777\n00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:23,870\nin another chapter--\n>> Yeah.\n\n778\n00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,510\n>> Is an attack that we\ncan do using that concept.\n\n779\n00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,690\nSo, Deborah I give you credit for\nthat as well.\n\n780\n00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:35,242\nYeah, there are some subtle\ndifferences between a syn flag and\n\n781\n00:36:35,242 --> 00:36:38,290\na half-open scan as we call that.\n\n782\n00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,330\nWe haven't addressed those yet, so\nit'd be fine to say that for right now.\n\n783\n00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,200\n>> But with what we know\nyou can actually say that.\n\n784\n00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,810\nBut once we get the syn flag you'll\nactually see the difference.\n\n785\n00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,290\n>> Yeah.\n>> There definitely is a difference\n\n786\n00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:50,800\nbetween the two.\n\n787\n00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,830\n>> Yep.\n>> It's maybe subtle, but it is there.\n\n788\n00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:55,479\n>> Yeah.\nOh, let them port numbers.\n\n789\n00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,130\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n790\n00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,446\nThose little things,\nyou know, a detail there.\n\n791\n00:36:59,446 --> 00:37:00,118\nAll right.\n\n792\n00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:03,135\nSo what what else can we look\nat in our results there.\n\n793\n00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:05,915\nI mean there's a lot of information and\nwhat else do we need to know about\n\n794\n00:37:07,335 --> 00:37:10,975\nWire Shark, like, the first thing I'm\nthinking of I've got a lot of packets.\n\n795\n00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:13,485\nI mean you saw, and this is a small\nnetwork that we're on here,\n\n796\n00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:17,170\nwe don't have that many nodes, although I\ngot quite a few of them that are kind of\n\n797\n00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:20,370\nstreaming at this point are clouds or\nvideos and all that.\n\n798\n00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,940\nBut really in the end probably a very\nsmall amount of traffic we capture\n\n799\n00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,210\non a big corporate network that list\ncould be huge in the same amount of time.\n\n800\n00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:32,485\nSo the first thing I think is,\nhow do I find what I'm looking for?\n\n801\n00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:37,610\n>> Yeah I won't construct a big long,\na big one in here,\n\n802\n00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:41,890\nbut I'll make you aware of it,\nis that if you need to,\n\n803\n00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:47,210\nyou can construct filters, which are\nbasically query statements in Wire Shark.\n\n804\n00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,040\nWhich will actually pull out\nselected information for you.\n\n805\n00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,550\nOr it could even color code it, so\nit will draw your attention to it.\n\n806\n00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,250\nIf you go thru a wire sharp window\njust on average, if you go thru it,\n\n807\n00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,585\nyou're going to see\nseveral different colors.\n\n808\n00:38:00,585 --> 00:38:03,830\nAnd I didn't necessarily show all\nthe colors here on my screen when I was\n\n809\n00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,790\ngoing thru it.\n\n810\n00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:09,810\nBut you'll see, you know, you'll see\nblacks and reds and different colors.\n\n811\n00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:15,750\nMean I can go through mine in here and\nyour seeing a lot of traffic but\n\n812\n00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,894\nthen you saw it pop in,\nyou saw right, oops, almost had it.\n\n813\n00:38:18,894 --> 00:38:23,300\n>> I know, the scroll bar's so\nbig its hard to actually.\n\n814\n00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,310\n>> Yeah, so I've got some different route,\n\n815\n00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,560\nyou see it's flagged as\na different protocol too.\n\n816\n00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,050\n>> So you can set up filters for\nreally anything.\n\n817\n00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,240\nAnd you know anything you want.\n\n818\n00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,620\nIt's just a question of what is,\nwhat is of value to you.\n\n819\n00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:41,510\nBut they, Wire Shark already has\nsome built in stuff in there.\n\n820\n00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,160\nAnd you can create your own.\n\n821\n00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,770\nYou know, however you want.\n\n822\n00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,530\nIf you find that necessary to do.\n\n823\n00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,180\n>> And then you can also, you know by\nthe way, you don't have to sit here and\n\n824\n00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:53,020\nsay oh well that looks good.\n\n825\n00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,560\nNow what?\nI'll move on to something else.\n\n826\n00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,820\nWhat if you want to come back to this,\nyou can go out there and save.\n\n827\n00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:01,740\nA packet capture.\n\n828\n00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,230\nAnd I don't think that's a bad\nidea to do if you're going\n\n829\n00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,070\nto include this in a report.\n\n830\n00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,892\nand if memory serves I, as you go onto\nthe Wire Shark site, or there's a wiki for\n\n831\n00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:19,220\nWire Shark that actually has a sample\npacket captures, PCAP files.\n\n832\n00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,900\nand they have ones for denial of service\nand ones for syn flag, stuff like that.\n\n833\n00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:29,050\nIf you Google sample PCAP files for\nWire Shark, you'll probably find\n\n834\n00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,550\nwhat's cool about that is you can\nopen those up right in Wire Shark and\n\n835\n00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,980\nit will show you pack captures\ngenerate during that attack phase, so\n\n836\n00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,100\nyou can see exactly what it looks\nlike when someone caught it live.\n\n837\n00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,798\nAnd, get your eyes, eyeballs used to it.\n\n838\n00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,158\n>> Because what's going to happen.\n\n839\n00:39:45,158 --> 00:39:49,468\nLike I said, on your exams they're going\nto show you data that was captured live,\n\n840\n00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:50,917\nand said What's going on.\n\n841\n00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,905\nYou make the call.\n\n842\n00:39:52,905 --> 00:39:54,542\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n843\n00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:55,070\n>> It's gonna,\n\n844\n00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,897\nit's gonna show you that type of stuff,\nso you know, be prepared for that.\n\n845\n00:39:57,897 --> 00:40:01,676\n>> That's a great resource though, because\nI mean, if I'm sitting in here at home and\n\n846\n00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:03,113\ntrying to practice this stuff,\n\n847\n00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:06,700\nwhat are the odds of me seeing some of\nthese different types of attacks, right?\n\n848\n00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,730\nHopefully none on my home network.\n\n849\n00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,620\nFor the ability to see those,\ncuz, as you said,\n\n850\n00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:13,115\nthey're gonna,\nthey could call you out on the exam, so.\n\n851\n00:40:13,115 --> 00:40:14,830\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Take a look at some of those, yeah,\n\n852\n00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:17,200\nI posted that,\nit's from the wiki wireshark.org.\n\n853\n00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,200\nAnd they've got a whole bunch of,\nas you said,\n\n854\n00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,585\nsample captures that you could take\na at and see what it looks like.\n\n855\n00:40:26,415 --> 00:40:28,805\nAnd great filters built into\nWireshark as you mentioned.\n\n856\n00:40:28,805 --> 00:40:31,955\nYou know, there's some drop downs\nwhere I can just hit a protocol,\n\n857\n00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:36,225\nyou can pick a source IP address or\na particular destination IP address.\n\n858\n00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:40,435\nYou can look at conversations where it'll\nactually show you just the packets going\n\n859\n00:40:40,435 --> 00:40:43,995\nback and forth between two different\nnodes, get rid of the rest of the stuff.\n\n860\n00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:46,325\nSo great filtering capabilities.\n\n861\n00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,270\nI think they also wanna\ncall out the command line\n\n862\n00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:52,040\noptions to set those filters as well,\n\n863\n00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,520\nso that documentation I linked to you\nguys will give you a good look at that.\n\n864\n00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,310\n>> Yeah, there are some,\nspeaking of command line, utilities, for\n\n865\n00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,390\ndoing pack and capture.\n\n866\n00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,580\nThere is tcpdump and WinDump.\n\n867\n00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,940\nAnd those are for Linux and\nWindows respectively.\n\n868\n00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,730\nAnd those can just be run\nright at the command line.\n\n869\n00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:13,200\nYou can dump everything\ndirectly out to a file.\n\n870\n00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,995\nIt won't present the same GUI that\nI'm seeing here for Wireshark.\n\n871\n00:41:16,995 --> 00:41:20,665\nBut it has the advantage of if it\ndoesn't do that it's very fast and\n\n872\n00:41:20,665 --> 00:41:25,140\nvery quiet and\nit takes up a lot less system resources.\n\n873\n00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,765\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n874\n00:41:25,765 --> 00:41:30,705\n>> So that's a huge benefit to that so\nyou should be aware of of those ones, too.\n\n875\n00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:33,457\nI'm not gonna to worry about\nwriting those ones in here, but\n\n876\n00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:37,757\nthere's a couple other\nthings you can actually use.\n\n877\n00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:43,187\nSome other stuff I feel it's\nworthwhile pointing out here is that\n\n878\n00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:48,107\nnot only can you select multiple\ninterfaces on this, something else,\n\n879\n00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:52,870\nyou can select multiple interfaces, you\ncan tell it how traffic you want to get.\n\n880\n00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:55,770\nBut, there's something down here\nthat sometimes messes with people.\n\n881\n00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:59,350\nAnd I kind of want to put a word of\ncaution down here is that if you have\n\n882\n00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,115\nthe traffic that we caught all IP\naddresses, it's not resolved to anything.\n\n883\n00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:06,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Okay, you could t echnically\n\n884\n00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,790\ngo over here and say resolve\nthe network letter names and do start.\n\n885\n00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,350\nAnd when it starts capturing,\nyou'll start getting stuff,\n\n886\n00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,110\nor you'll start getting some stuff,\nit's not doing it yet, but\n\n887\n00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,742\nyou'll get stuff resolving\nto machine names.\n\n888\n00:42:20,742 --> 00:42:21,440\n>> Mm-hm.\nMm-hm.\n\n889\n00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,000\n>> It's not something you wanna do in\n\n890\n00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,710\npractice because if you do that\nin practice, what's gonna happen\n\n891\n00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:32,635\nis is that it's actually Wiresharks\nmake inquiries out to DNS.\n\n892\n00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:37,025\nAnd if you're making queries up to DNS,\nyou're sending a lot of flares up,\n\n893\n00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:38,135\nthat someone's gonna see it.\n\n894\n00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:40,205\n>> Most likely gonna be logged.\n\n895\n00:42:40,205 --> 00:42:43,625\nAnd I don't believe we're running\na reverse lookup zone on the ITPro TV\n\n896\n00:42:43,625 --> 00:42:46,782\nnetwork so that's why you're probably\nnot I'm not seeing any names there.\n\n897\n00:42:46,782 --> 00:42:49,712\nSo what I really like is it's the IP\naddress when I pack it, right.\n\n898\n00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:51,242\nAnd then it can take that IP address and\n\n899\n00:42:51,242 --> 00:42:54,582\nturn it around and do a reverse\nlookup with DNS to return the name.\n\n900\n00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:59,092\nAnd we're not running a reverse lookup\non the show, so, shame on us but [LAUGH]\n\n901\n00:42:59,092 --> 00:43:00,561\n>> No biggie.\n\n902\n00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:06,261\n>> All right\n>> And one more thing to add on to this,\n\n903\n00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:10,671\nas far as a sniffing wireless traffic\nI'll throw it in because some of you\n\n904\n00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:15,751\nmight be on wireless, or\nget tempted to do this in a wireless.\n\n905\n00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:18,665\nIt'll work, Wireshark will work on\nwireless the way it is right now.\n\n906\n00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:20,180\nOkay.\n\n907\n00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:23,510\nBut if you really wanna dig\ninto the guts of wireless,\n\n908\n00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,160\nyou gotta have something called AirPcap.\n\n909\n00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,340\nIt's a little tool about like that big and\n\n910\n00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,780\nyou plug in the USB\ndevice into your system.\n\n911\n00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,060\nAnd Wireshark will actually have an\nadditional section show up on its toolbar\n\n912\n00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:43,420\nand you'll be allowed to sniff stuff\ndown a the hardware level in Wireshark.\n\n913\n00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,950\nIf you don't need that capability,\nthen you don't need to worry about it.\n\n914\n00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:49,520\n>> Right.\n\n915\n00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,070\n>> Airpcap is not cheap at all.\n\n916\n00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,450\nI mean,\nit goes anywhere from 300 to $800 for\n\n917\n00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:57,755\na little thing that's\na size of a flashlight.\n\n918\n00:43:57,755 --> 00:44:01,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you can get them on eBay cheaper,\n\n919\n00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:03,010\nbut you're gonna get into\na bidding war with them.\n\n920\n00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,120\nI'll tell you that right now.\n\n921\n00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,020\n>> All right, well.\n\n922\n00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,670\nAnything else we want\nto add on Wireshark and\n\n923\n00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,310\ndo we still need to go\nover some other sniffers?\n\n924\n00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,440\nYou kind of talked about a few\nof the other ones there.\n\n925\n00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,180\n>> I talked about a few of the other ones.\n\n926\n00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,270\nWireshark is the big\none that we'll go over.\n\n927\n00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,360\nWe don't necessarily\nneed to get in too deep.\n\n928\n00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,870\nWhat we need to talk about is some of\nthe things you can do to manipulate\n\n929\n00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,030\ntraffic with a sniffer.\n\n930\n00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,460\nWe can talk about that.\n\n931\n00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:30,190\n>> Alright Well I tell you what,\nlooking at the clock its about time for\n\n932\n00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:32,890\nus to take our break, so\nwhy don't we go ahead, do that, and\n\n933\n00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:38,000\nwhen we come back we'll talk about some\nof the types of attacks in just a few.\n\n934\n00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,394\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n935\n00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:46,350\n[MUSIC]\n\n936\n00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,030\nWelcome back, everybody.\n\n937\n00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,610\nSo, getting ready to go into, or\ncontinue on, with our sniffer discussion,\n\n938\n00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:54,960\nnow we're going to start taking a look\nat some of the different attacks or\n\n939\n00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,901\nattack vectors that they have where\nthe sniffing might come into play.\n\n940\n00:44:59,901 --> 00:45:02,020\n>> Yeah, we need to really discuss that\n\n941\n00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:07,160\non what you can really do with\na sniffer and what you're looking for.\n\n942\n00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:13,985\nWe've so far told you what sets\nthe stage for a sniffer to work.\n\n943\n00:45:13,985 --> 00:45:16,120\nWe told you about active and\npassive sniffing.\n\n944\n00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,990\nKinda showed you a peek at Wireshark and\n\n945\n00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:23,550\nshowed you some stuff going\nby both live and static.\n\n946\n00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:29,860\nNow we will have kind of opened up that\nlast little bit which is what is what\n\n947\n00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,820\nreally enables you to, or\nwhat type of things are available and\n\n948\n00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:37,040\nwhat type of a task can you\ndoyou know with a sniffer.\n\n949\n00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,970\nWell sniffers,\nreally what you're looking at,\n\n950\n00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:45,230\nthey're mainly going to be concerned\nwith doing things with confidentiality.\n\n951\n00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:48,105\nWe talk about CIA, that's what\nthey're really going to go into.\n\n952\n00:45:48,105 --> 00:45:54,560\nSo if we look at that, things that\nwe can compromise with a sniffer or\n\n953\n00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:00,405\nany of our older protocols that aren't\nsecure, you got things like http\n\n954\n00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:05,075\nSMTP, MNTP if you're using that\nwhich amazingly a lot I think\n\n955\n00:46:05,075 --> 00:46:09,940\nstill are if you're running older versions\nof Exchange, public folders use those.\n\n956\n00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,495\nSo that's something you could intercept\nwith that there's things like pop,\n\n957\n00:46:15,495 --> 00:46:18,355\nFTP, SNMP or\n\n958\n00:46:18,355 --> 00:46:23,720\nTelnet, those are all absolutely\n100% vulnerable To being sniffed.\n\n959\n00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,410\nAnd so if you haven't taken\nextra steps to secure those\n\n960\n00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,552\nprotocols then a sniffer can conceivably\nintercept that information and\n\n961\n00:46:33,552 --> 00:46:37,640\nread it and\nsee what you're actually doing.\n\n962\n00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,560\n>> Yeah.\n\n963\n00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,440\nWhen we take a look at the Wireshark,\nit's got the different panes there down at\n\n964\n00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,600\nthe bottom of that there was a hexadecimal\narea where it's showing you the hex code.\n\n965\n00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:50,000\nAnd just to the right of that it was\nshowing us what looked like garbley gook,\n\n966\n00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,580\nbunch of crazy characters and\nthings like that.\n\n967\n00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,720\nBut if you're capturing emails, or\n\n968\n00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,390\nword documents are being copied across\nthe network and things like that,\n\n969\n00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,720\nthat bottom right hand pane, that's\nwhere you'll actually read the email.\n\n970\n00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,320\nOr you'll read the webpage.\n\n971\n00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,750\nOr you'll see the password listed there.\n\n972\n00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:09,690\nThe user name listed there.\n\n973\n00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,410\nSo depending on the program and Wireshark\nbeing one of them it'll decode that and\n\n974\n00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:14,780\nshow you that plain text right there.\n\n975\n00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,880\nSo when we say you can read the data,\n\n976\n00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,830\nI mean, you can literally\nread it right out of there.\n\n977\n00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,670\nNow that email might be broken up\ninto multiple chunks, right, or\n\n978\n00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:25,240\nthat document as it's travelling across\nthe network might be in multiple frames or\n\n979\n00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,830\nmultiple packets, but\nput it all together and we can read it.\n\n980\n00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,419\nSo that's dangerous.\n\n981\n00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:31,186\n>> Yes.\n\n982\n00:47:31,186 --> 00:47:35,713\nAnd there's even, to talk about just\nthe email part of it, show you about\n\n983\n00:47:35,713 --> 00:47:40,535\nspecialized sniffers, there's one in\nthe D sniff suite that actually allows\n\n984\n00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:44,574\nyou to view M box, if things are in\nthat format, the M box format.\n\n985\n00:47:44,574 --> 00:47:47,553\n>> It will actually just sniff\nthe traffic, look for inbox stuff and\n\n986\n00:47:47,553 --> 00:47:50,670\nit will reassemble and\ndisplay the full email on your screen.\n\n987\n00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,880\n>> Just like it had been sent to you.\n\n988\n00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n989\n00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It'll be right there on screen,\n\n990\n00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:55,160\nblack and white.\n\n991\n00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,601\nThere's nothing more that you have to do,\n\n992\n00:47:58,601 --> 00:48:02,340\nexcept you just read it or,\nand you're done.\n\n993\n00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,729\nIt's kinda scary on this just how quickly\nand easily, you can get access to that.\n\n994\n00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:07,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n995\n00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,180\n>> For passwords.\n\n996\n00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:14,221\nDSNEF includes something like that will\nactually plug SNGP passwords right\n\n997\n00:48:14,221 --> 00:48:19,101\nout of the traffic and display it, I,\nso it really couldn't be any easier\n\n998\n00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:23,824\nwhen you get down to it and you also\nhave wire shark itself or passwords,\n\n999\n00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:28,885\nall you got do for passwords is\nWire Shark or SMDP or another format.\n\n1000\n00:48:28,885 --> 00:48:32,231\nIt just sees the protocol comes across and\njust open up the frame and\n\n1001\n00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:33,795\nyou'll see it right in there.\n\n1002\n00:48:33,795 --> 00:48:34,845\n>> Right.\n>> And you're done.\n\n1003\n00:48:34,845 --> 00:48:35,865\n>> Yep, that's all it takes.\n\n1004\n00:48:35,865 --> 00:48:38,844\n>> And if there's,\nit makes things really, really easy.\n\n1005\n00:48:38,844 --> 00:48:41,945\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which also speaks quite clearly to why\n\n1006\n00:48:41,945 --> 00:48:48,025\nyou need to have permission before you do\nthis on a network, if you, on any network.\n\n1007\n00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because if you don't,\n\n1008\n00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,787\nyou very easily could see\nsomething you're not supposed to.\n\n1009\n00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:52,340\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1010\n00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,937\nI used to do a demo and\nthen they've fixed this since then, but\n\n1011\n00:48:55,937 --> 00:48:57,400\nMeasure Up used to do it.\n\n1012\n00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,268\nAnd you guys are familiar\nprobably with Measure Up,\n\n1013\n00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:00,720\nit was one of the practice exam engines.\n\n1014\n00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:04,321\nAnd you can try this with any place,\nif you are at home and you want to see how\n\n1015\n00:49:04,321 --> 00:49:08,240\nthis stuff works, fire up that sniffer and\nthen shoot off an email to somebody.\n\n1016\n00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,784\nIt's not gonna be encrypted, unless you\nare using PGP or something like that.\n\n1017\n00:49:11,784 --> 00:49:15,485\nGo to some website and you fire up your\nsniffer, connect to your website and\n\n1018\n00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:19,364\nauthenticate and then stop your sniffer\nand go back and look at that traffic and\n\n1019\n00:49:19,364 --> 00:49:23,478\nsee if you can find the packet, where your\nauthentication request was sent over and\n\n1020\n00:49:23,478 --> 00:49:25,860\nsee if that passwords encrypted or not.\n\n1021\n00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,888\nLike I said,\nI used to do a little demo with that,\n\n1022\n00:49:27,888 --> 00:49:30,220\ncuz Measure Up used to be\na site that didn't encrypt it.\n\n1023\n00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,142\nSo my students were always shocked\nwhen they're like, oh, holy crap,\n\n1024\n00:49:32,142 --> 00:49:33,660\nthere's your password right there.\n\n1025\n00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,197\nI didn't put my real password in there,\nobviously.\n\n1026\n00:49:35,197 --> 00:49:35,880\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1027\n00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,038\n>> Cuz I knew it was gonna pop up on\nthe screen, but it's fun to play with and\n\n1028\n00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:40,700\nit is an eye-opener, I think.\n\n1029\n00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:44,749\nIt makes you realize when,\ncuz some people don't, I don't think they,\n\n1030\n00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:49,050\nwe talk about plain text and blah, blah,\nblah, but they think, it's not that easy.\n\n1031\n00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:51,340\nYou gotta put that stuff back together or\nsomething.\n\n1032\n00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:51,880\nYeah, it's really.\n\n1033\n00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,380\n>> Sometimes you do, but-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1034\n00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:56,342\n>> And it that really use to be the case,\nat one point in time,\n\n1035\n00:49:56,342 --> 00:49:57,920\nyou have to reassemble stuff.\n\n1036\n00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,700\nNow a days, you really don't,\nit does it for you.\n\n1037\n00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,554\n>> Yeah.\n>> And it'll put those say and\n\n1038\n00:50:02,554 --> 00:50:06,498\nit'll put those things together for\nyou all you gotta do is just read it and\n\n1039\n00:50:06,498 --> 00:50:10,750\nunderstand how to interpret it, but\nit's got everything right there.\n\n1040\n00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:13,968\nThey've just have taken a lot of\nthat leg work that you're used to,\n\n1041\n00:50:13,968 --> 00:50:14,989\ntaken out of the way.\n\n1042\n00:50:14,989 --> 00:50:15,940\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1043\n00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,420\nAbsolutely.\n\n1044\n00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,914\nSo as far as scanning and text and really,\n\n1045\n00:50:19,914 --> 00:50:24,261\nseems like scanning is real is not\nthe attack itself, but it's giving me\n\n1046\n00:50:24,261 --> 00:50:29,070\nthe information that I need maybe to\ngo on into the next phase of my attack.\n\n1047\n00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:30,422\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> Although, I guess,\n\n1048\n00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:33,230\nconfidentiality though,\nthat is an attack in and of itself.\n\n1049\n00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,005\n>> Yeah, you've compromised it,\ndefinitely.\n\n1050\n00:50:36,005 --> 00:50:38,460\nSo when you talk about sniffing.\n\n1051\n00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,388\nYes it's a viewing information, but\n\n1052\n00:50:40,388 --> 00:50:44,303\nand something else you might have to do as\npart of the attack is alter the flow of\n\n1053\n00:50:44,303 --> 00:50:47,530\ninformation as well that\nsomething else that comes in.\n\n1054\n00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:52,457\nAnd so that's where you get things one\ncommon one to do is what they call art\n\n1055\n00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:53,342\npoisoning.\n\n1056\n00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,799\nThat can change the flow of traffic,\n\n1057\n00:50:55,799 --> 00:51:00,157\nwhat you're doing is that you're\nchanging when someone does a,\n\n1058\n00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:05,310\ntries to resolve an IP address to\na MAC address using the ARP protocol.\n\n1059\n00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:09,325\nWhat I'll do is I'll know that ARP will\ngo out there and make a broadcast and\n\n1060\n00:51:09,325 --> 00:51:12,065\nlook to see what IP address\ngoes to its MAC address,\n\n1061\n00:51:12,065 --> 00:51:14,135\nif it hasn't already seen it before.\n\n1062\n00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:17,147\nWhat I will do is I will\nproactively inject something\n\n1063\n00:51:17,147 --> 00:51:19,685\ninto the cache in your system, poisoning.\n\n1064\n00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:22,425\nThat's what poison is,\nyou're proactively doing something.\n\n1065\n00:51:22,425 --> 00:51:26,612\nI'll poison the, the ARP cache on your\nsystem with the IP address to MAC address\n\n1066\n00:51:26,612 --> 00:51:30,720\nmapping that I want you to have,\npresumably it'll go to my station.\n\n1067\n00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,769\nIn which case, I'd just wait out there for\nyou to make a connection to that or\n\n1068\n00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:36,300\nrequest to connect to that.\n\n1069\n00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,143\nYou look at the cache in your system, it\nsays, oh, the MAC address is over here and\n\n1070\n00:51:40,143 --> 00:51:42,240\nit will go to, to my system instead.\n\n1071\n00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:45,800\nIn which case, you're going through me and\nI can start sniffing your traffic.\n\n1072\n00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,483\n>> Yeah, ARP's an interesting one,\n\n1073\n00:51:47,483 --> 00:51:51,353\nbecause there's not a lot of security\ninvolved with ARP and you're machines will\n\n1074\n00:51:51,353 --> 00:51:55,140\nactually cache information that they\ndidn't even ask for, which is always.\n\n1075\n00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,399\nSo I can fill out a response to\na question that was never asked and\n\n1076\n00:51:58,399 --> 00:52:02,274\nI could give machines the cache that,\nand that could lead to some more tax,\n\n1077\n00:52:02,274 --> 00:52:05,250\ncuz now we're redirecting\nthat traffic on the network.\n\n1078\n00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:06,590\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1079\n00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:10,971\nIt's just change, you're changing that\nflow something that's more desirable\n\n1080\n00:52:10,971 --> 00:52:13,010\nto you rather than the standard flow.\n\n1081\n00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,391\nYeah and you're absolutely right.\n\n1082\n00:52:15,391 --> 00:52:17,880\nARP is something that doesn't\nhave any security built into it.\n\n1083\n00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:18,650\nIt wasn't meant for that.\n\n1084\n00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,593\nIt, the one thing it was designed\nto do it does it perfectly,\n\n1085\n00:52:21,593 --> 00:52:23,050\nthere's no argument there.\n\n1086\n00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:27,629\nIt's that other part of it that\nit has where there's issues.\n\n1087\n00:52:27,629 --> 00:52:33,130\nSo think about that and that's just one\nway to alter the way traffic moves.\n\n1088\n00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,890\nWe have plenty of other ways to do it.\n\n1089\n00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,040\nWe've talked about the active and\npassive, but\n\n1090\n00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,829\nwe have other things in there too\nthat can change the flow of it.\n\n1091\n00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:40,390\n>> Right.\n\n1092\n00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:45,478\nYeah, we mention what the the MAC\nflooding, using something like MAC off or\n\n1093\n00:52:45,478 --> 00:52:50,489\nsomething like that to convince that\nswitch or to overload that switch, so\n\n1094\n00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:55,920\nthat it maybe turns into a HUB, starts\nsplitting out the traffic over all ports.\n\n1095\n00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,200\nSomething I think we were going to talk\nabout was the Mac address spoofing.\n\n1096\n00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,369\nKind of goes along with our ARP spoofing.\n\n1097\n00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:01,340\nRight?\n\n1098\n00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:03,957\n>> Yes.\nThere is something called MAC spoofing and\n\n1099\n00:53:03,957 --> 00:53:07,000\nit's relatively easy to do\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n1100\n00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,880\nYou can go into the network adapter for\nreally any Windows or\n\n1101\n00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,590\nLinux system and\nchange the hardware address.\n\n1102\n00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:21,230\nOn a Windows system, all you have to\ndo is go into the network adapter and\n\n1103\n00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,340\nconfigure the network adapter itself.\n\n1104\n00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:27,420\nNot the TCPI key settings, but\nthe network adapter settings.\n\n1105\n00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,376\nAnd usually, there's an advanced\ntab in there and it will say,\n\n1106\n00:53:30,376 --> 00:53:34,510\nlocally administered address or hardware\naddress, something to that nature.\n\n1107\n00:53:34,510 --> 00:53:39,260\nAnd what you do is you just change that\nto be a MAC address that you want.\n\n1108\n00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,839\nIf you don't want to do it that way,\nyou actually have third party utilities,\n\n1109\n00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:45,295\nlike smack is one that easy\ncounsel likes to mention.\n\n1110\n00:53:45,295 --> 00:53:46,050\n>> Yeah.\n\n1111\n00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:49,420\n>> That you can use that to change the MAC\naddress to something that you want.\n\n1112\n00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:54,269\nBut if you change the MAC address to clone\nsomebody else's, you can get traffic for\n\n1113\n00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:57,580\nthat was intended for\nthat person to come to you.\n\n1114\n00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:02,130\nOn the Linux side, you can do the same\nthing, but what you have to do is you have\n\n1115\n00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,350\nto use ifconfig to bring\nthe network interface down and\n\n1116\n00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:09,690\nthen you give the adapter the new hardware\naddress and then you bring it and\n\n1117\n00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,260\nthen you bring the adapter backup\nwith the new address on it.\n\n1118\n00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,336\n>> Yeah, a lot of people\nare under the false concep,\n\n1119\n00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,420\nthe idea that these MAC\naddresses are permanent.\n\n1120\n00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,920\nThey're burned into the devices and\nyou can't change it.\n\n1121\n00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,500\nIt's true technically,\n\n1122\n00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:27,360\nthe addresses assigned by the manufacturer\nto that network adapter or\n\n1123\n00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:32,360\nwhatever that device is, but my operating\nsystem has to read that from the card and\n\n1124\n00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,950\nstore it somewhere in the registry and\nmy configuration settings.\n\n1125\n00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:39,311\nSo what we're doing is we're just\nchanging with the operating system,\n\n1126\n00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:41,900\nwe're not changing the actual\nMAC address on the card or\n\n1127\n00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,170\nwe're changing worthy operating\nsystem thinks that MAC address is.\n\n1128\n00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:46,649\nAnd so now, all of a sudden and\never after,\n\n1129\n00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:49,570\nwe'll listen to the traffic that's\ndestined for that MAC address.\n\n1130\n00:54:49,570 --> 00:54:52,000\nWe get switches to get\na little bit confused.\n\n1131\n00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,814\nThis can lead to all kinds of different\nattacks as well that we're gonna talk\n\n1132\n00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:57,570\nabout later on.\n\n1133\n00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,380\nIf I do it through the US,\ndepending on how I do it.\n\n1134\n00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,217\nIt might not be persistent,\nbecause when the system reboots,\n\n1135\n00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,856\nit can pull all the information from that\nhardware and get right MAC address again\n\n1136\n00:55:06,856 --> 00:55:09,694\nor some of those programs like\nyou were talking about, Smack or\n\n1137\n00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:12,693\nsomething like that could actually\nmake that change persistent,\n\n1138\n00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:15,360\nwhere it would survive through\na reboot if I needed it too.\n\n1139\n00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,493\n>> Yeah, if you actually do it\nin Windows through the actual,\n\n1140\n00:55:19,493 --> 00:55:23,470\nthe hardware settings,\nthat way should be persistent.\n\n1141\n00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:25,315\nBut you're right, there's no guarantees.\n\n1142\n00:55:25,315 --> 00:55:28,186\nSo generally, that one will persist,\n\n1143\n00:55:28,186 --> 00:55:32,800\nbecause you are hardcoded in at\nthat point, it stays that way.\n\n1144\n00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,620\nBut there are situations,\nit's not true with every vendor too.\n\n1145\n00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,016\nSome vendors don't do that the same way.\n\n1146\n00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:39,450\nSome vendors don't even have the hardware,\n\n1147\n00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,149\nthe ability to change\nlocal administer address.\n\n1148\n00:55:42,149 --> 00:55:42,823\n>> True.\n\n1149\n00:55:42,823 --> 00:55:43,961\nYeah, who knows?\n\n1150\n00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:45,760\nAnd always double check.\n\n1151\n00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,862\nThat's just the long and short of it.\n\n1152\n00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:48,384\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1153\n00:55:48,384 --> 00:55:52,527\n>> I'd also talk to one of the points\nthat you brought up, Mike,\n\n1154\n00:55:52,527 --> 00:55:58,426\nis that you're always you're taught that\nthese MAC addresses are something that's,\n\n1155\n00:55:58,426 --> 00:55:59,640\nthey're there.\n\n1156\n00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,795\nThat's the way they're gonna be.\n\n1157\n00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:01,823\n>> Mm-hm right.\n>> And that's the way they're gonna stay.\n\n1158\n00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:04,827\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is one of those things that I was\n\n1159\n00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:06,032\ntalking about early on.\n\n1160\n00:56:06,032 --> 00:56:10,065\nWell, in our early episodes,\nis that it's, I don't have,\n\n1161\n00:56:10,065 --> 00:56:14,780\nI was saying about formal training\nversus doing stuff on your own.\n\n1162\n00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,940\nFormal training's great.\n\n1163\n00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,540\nLearning on your own is great.\n\n1164\n00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:23,436\nOne of the things you'll learn when you\ndo formal training is that they'll tell\n\n1165\n00:56:23,436 --> 00:56:25,493\nyou MAC addresses is one of them.\n\n1166\n00:56:25,493 --> 00:56:27,130\nThey can't change.\n\n1167\n00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:30,200\nBut I always tell you when you get\nto the security side of things,\n\n1168\n00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,760\none of the things you should always\nkeep in mind is everything's negotiable.\n\n1169\n00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,475\nYou know, everything is up for grabs.\n\n1170\n00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just because you were told\n\n1171\n00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:41,260\nsomething like that before, that, hey,\na MAC address can't change like a network\n\n1172\n00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:43,000\nplus when you go to that one,\nthey'll say it a lot.\n\n1173\n00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,090\nLike this is the MAC address,\nand it's burnt in, and\n\n1174\n00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:46,895\nthou shall not ever have another one.\n\n1175\n00:56:46,895 --> 00:56:48,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They'll tell you\n\n1176\n00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,970\nto rip out the network card and\nput a new one in.\n\n1177\n00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,330\nHere we just learned that,\nyeah you can change that you know so\n\n1178\n00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:57,680\nlike I said remember in security\njust about everything's negotiable.\n\n1179\n00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,220\nYou can change stuff like that so\nabsolutely do remember that.\n\n1180\n00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,490\nThat we can, that a lot of the rules\nthat you've brought in other places,\n\n1181\n00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:07,550\nyou can change.\n\n1182\n00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,160\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1183\n00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,630\nWhat applies today might not apply\ntomorrow because it is an ever changing,\n\n1184\n00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:16,790\nvery dynamic knowledge and\nyou've got to stay on top of it.\n\n1185\n00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:18,330\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1186\n00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:22,149\n>> All right, other types of attacks that\nwe need to discuss with our sniffers?\n\n1187\n00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,660\n>> Those are the big ones.\n\n1188\n00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,540\nThere are some other\nones that come into play.\n\n1189\n00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:31,990\nYou could do stuff with DHCP,\ninterestingly enough.\n\n1190\n00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,830\nThere's one more really big one, DHCP\n\n1191\n00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,250\nyou can run some additional tacks where\nyou could do an attack into DHCP where it\n\n1192\n00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:45,220\nchews up all the leases in a specific\nrange, and so what happens is if\n\n1193\n00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,880\nyou chew up all the specifics in that\nrange no one gets an IP address anymore.\n\n1194\n00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:53,160\nIf you haven't already leased one\nfrom there, you're not getting it.\n\n1195\n00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:57,430\nAnd so what do I do, is the next stage\nof that is after I chewed up all\n\n1196\n00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:02,690\nthe available IP addresses,\nI can deploy my own rogue DHCP server and\n\n1197\n00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:07,470\nso when requests come up from\nthat point on for an IP address,\n\n1198\n00:58:07,470 --> 00:58:12,510\nsince one DHCP server's full, it's that\nDHCP discover request is gonna hit\n\n1199\n00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:17,540\nmy DHCP server and I'm gonna give\nyou an IP address out of my range.\n\n1200\n00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,850\nThe thing is is that my range\ngives you an IP address, yes,\n\n1201\n00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,098\nbut it also gives you a DNS and\na gateway that I control.\n\n1202\n00:58:24,098 --> 00:58:27,605\nSo now your traffic is filtered through\na point where I can easily sniff.\n\n1203\n00:58:27,605 --> 00:58:28,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1204\n00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:31,540\n>> And so it acts as a very good choke\npoint where stuff is going to go in and\n\n1205\n00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,380\nout through there.\n\n1206\n00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,400\nI'll see everything.\n\n1207\n00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,310\n>> Right.\nAnd not that hard to do, right?\n\n1208\n00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,420\nTo make up a few DHCP requests to\nburn through that pool and, heck,\n\n1209\n00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,798\nyou can run a rogue DHCP server on\njust about anything nowadays, so.\n\n1210\n00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:48,190\n>> Yeah, and there's twists specifically\ndesigned to chew up the stuff in DHCP.\n\n1211\n00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:51,470\nI mean, there's one really low\ntech one that's been around for\n\n1212\n00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,070\na while called Gobbler.\n\n1213\n00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:57,250\nThat's exactly what it does, you just,\nyou turn it on and boom, it'll chew, it'll\n\n1214\n00:58:57,250 --> 00:59:01,480\nsend a bunch of discover requests out and\nlease every IP address that's left.\n\n1215\n00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,010\n>> Right.\n>> And then you're done.\n\n1216\n00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:04,950\n>> Oh.\nI love the names of these tools, too.\n\n1217\n00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,789\nAren't they,\nthey are very creative with those.\n\n1218\n00:59:06,789 --> 00:59:07,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1219\n00:59:07,730 --> 00:59:08,230\n>> Yeah.\n\n1220\n00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:08,890\nAbsolutely.\n\n1221\n00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,270\n[LAUGH]\n\n1222\n00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:12,280\n>> All right.\n\n1223\n00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,200\nSo, anything else we want to throw in to\n\n1224\n00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:19,785\nround off our little sniffer section?\n>> I think what we need,\n\n1225\n00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:23,365\nwhat we should do, is once we know\nabout the different attacks, and\n\n1226\n00:59:23,365 --> 00:59:25,115\nlet me kinda bring stuff up here.\n\n1227\n00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:30,665\nOnce we know about the different attacks\nwe should know about how to actually stop\n\n1228\n00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:35,025\nthem that's the thing is how you can stop\nsome from being a victim of sniffing or\n\n1229\n00:59:35,025 --> 00:59:37,165\nhaving it impact you.\n\n1230\n00:59:37,165 --> 00:59:39,540\nWell with sniffing the big one is,\n\n1231\n00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,920\nis just one of the big\ntechniques we use is encryption.\n\n1232\n00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,625\n>> Right.\n\n1233\n00:59:43,625 --> 00:59:46,013\n>> Encryption's gonna stop\na lot of the stuff cold.\n\n1234\n00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:50,772\nYou can sniff what you can't read,\nbut you still can't read it.\n\n1235\n00:59:50,772 --> 00:59:51,757\nYou have to get the key, so-\n>> So\n\n1236\n00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:53,891\nit doesn't really stop them from sniffing\n>> Yeah.\n\n1237\n00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:56,294\n>> But the result of their\nsniffing is gonna be fruitless.\n\n1238\n00:59:56,294 --> 00:59:57,199\nYeah, exactly.\n\n1239\n00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:58,478\nThey can still sniff.\n\n1240\n00:59:58,478 --> 01:00:03,120\nIt's not stopping that but they,\nbut while they can sniff it,\n\n1241\n01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,710\nit's just a bunch of gobbly goop.\n\n1242\n01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:08,450\nThey can't actually crack it.\n\n1243\n01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:12,270\nThey'd have to have a key or\nsomething which is a whole other matter so\n\n1244\n01:00:12,270 --> 01:00:14,150\nyou have that.\n\n1245\n01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:19,100\nIt's like I could turn on a wire shark\nright now and sniff SSL traffic all day,\n\n1246\n01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,450\nbut I'm not gonna be able to do much with\nthat because it's encrypted with SSL.\n\n1247\n01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,710\nDo remember that.\n\n1248\n01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:31,545\nThat's one of the big defenses that\nyou have is just, is use encryption.\n\n1249\n01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,120\nBut encryption isn't\nnecessarily good in every case.\n\n1250\n01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,190\n>> Right.\n>> You know encryption can be,\n\n1251\n01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:37,800\nis very good in some situations.\n\n1252\n01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,820\nOther situations it's not practical\nto use that type of thing.\n\n1253\n01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,280\n>> Absolutely, I mean you got\noverhead of the encryption itself.\n\n1254\n01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,640\nYou've got to worry about making sure\nthe other end of the conversation\n\n1255\n01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,560\nas using the same encryption algorithms.\n\n1256\n01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,000\nYou've got to talk about key distribution.\n\n1257\n01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,090\nWhether they're doing symmetric,\n\n1258\n01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:58,210\nasymmetric or some combination thereof and\nit might work really well in house,\n\n1259\n01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:01,990\nwhere I can issue all certificates to all\nmy users, and we can set all this up, and\n\n1260\n01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:06,900\nwe can require this through group policy,\nand create our policies, and set up this\n\n1261\n01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,700\nencryption for our traffic, but what about\ncommunications with a business partner.\n\n1262\n01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,870\nA new customer that we're\ntrying to reach out to.\n\n1263\n01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,970\nHow can I encrypt that traffic?\n\n1264\n01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:20,240\nI've got no pre-setup or\nanything going on with this other end, so\n\n1265\n01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,020\nit's not the end all of solutions.\n\n1266\n01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:26,210\nIn the right place, it is, but\nit can't protect you from everything.\n\n1267\n01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,082\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1268\n01:01:28,082 --> 01:01:32,700\n>> So, encryption, we said that encryption\nis gonna help me with my confidentiality,\n\n1269\n01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,010\nso it kind of makes sense, right?\n\n1270\n01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,400\nBecause we said sniffers are gonna\nviolate the confidentiality of the C\n\n1271\n01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,880\nin the CIA triad.\n\n1272\n01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,040\nEncryption gives me that confidentiality,\n\n1273\n01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,470\nso that's my countermeasure to\nthe sniffing, is the encryption.\n\n1274\n01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,220\nIs one method.\n\n1275\n01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:46,130\n>> Yes.\n\n1276\n01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:49,950\nYeah that's definitely one\nway of countering it, but\n\n1277\n01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:53,332\nthere's other methods out there, too,\nyou can use to deal with sniffing.\n\n1278\n01:01:53,332 --> 01:01:53,897\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1279\n01:01:53,897 --> 01:01:58,840\n>> Encryption's really,\na kind of a proactive type thing,\n\n1280\n01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,580\nis that you just use IPSec or S Assault,\n\n1281\n01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:06,120\nwhatever to encrypt your traffic,\nprior to anyone intercepting it.\n\n1282\n01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,270\nTherefore if they do happen\nto get one over and,\n\n1283\n01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,364\nand start sniffing,\nit's not something they can read.\n\n1284\n01:02:12,364 --> 01:02:18,160\nBut what if, what about the sniffers\nthat someone may already have turned on,\n\n1285\n01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,190\nhow do you detect that?\n\n1286\n01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:22,220\nThat's the next thing.\n\n1287\n01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:27,600\nThat's pretty easily dealt with as\nwell if you know what to do and\n\n1288\n01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:32,540\nthe way to detect sniffing, even if it's\npassive, is you need to think about,\n\n1289\n01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:35,755\ngo back and think about,\nwhat the requirements are for sniffing.\n\n1290\n01:02:35,755 --> 01:02:39,190\nAndwhat the requirements\nare right off the bat,\n\n1291\n01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:43,270\nwe said you need to have a network card\nthat switches into promiscuous mode.\n\n1292\n01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,370\nWell that answers\nthe question right there.\n\n1293\n01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:50,030\nWhat are you gonna look for that,\nto stop something when you find it?\n\n1294\n01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:52,030\nOr stop something that's\nsniffing when it comes on.\n\n1295\n01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:54,840\nIf it has to be in promiscuous mode,\nyou're gonna look for\n\n1296\n01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:56,550\nnetwork cards that\nare in promiscuous mode.\n\n1297\n01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:00,610\nAnd there's a multitude of tools\nthat look specifically for that.\n\n1298\n01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:06,060\nThere's ones that are built into\nexisting network management utilities.\n\n1299\n01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:08,259\nAnd then there's things like prom query,\n\n1300\n01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:10,650\nis one that's specifically designed for\nit.\n\n1301\n01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,900\n>> Did you say prom query?\n\n1302\n01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1303\n01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:14,600\n>> You guys write your own\n\n1304\n01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,848\nmaterial on that.\n\n1305\n01:03:15,848 --> 01:03:18,900\nSo it's got,\n\n1306\n01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:23,490\nthere's that one, plus there's some on\nthe Linux side that you can chew on.\n\n1307\n01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:28,420\nThere's like Arp Watch on the Linux side\nthat's designed to do this sorta thing.\n\n1308\n01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,780\nIf they see a card in promiscuous mode,\nyou're going to get an alert and\n\n1309\n01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,978\nthen you can go out and find out why\nthat card is in promiscuous mode.\n\n1310\n01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:39,403\n>> Cuz in the end, I mean, why would I be,\nwhat other reason would I have for putting\n\n1311\n01:03:39,403 --> 01:03:43,850\nmy card in promiscuous mode and I really\ncan't think of any off the top of my head.\n\n1312\n01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:45,696\n>> There are some reasons, yeah.\n\n1313\n01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:48,822\n>> Yeah, I was going to say other than\nsniffing traffic and things like that.\n\n1314\n01:03:48,822 --> 01:03:53,017\nSo, in most environments if there is\na network adapter in promiscuous mode,\n\n1315\n01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:56,535\npretty good chance that they're\ndoing some traffic sniffing.\n\n1316\n01:03:56,535 --> 01:03:58,280\n>> Yeah, it very well could be.\n\n1317\n01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:04,960\nNow there are actually some other reasons\nwhy you'd be in promiscuous mode.\n\n1318\n01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:08,942\nAnd that's why you don't immediately want\nto say, oh we've got a sniffer out here.\n\n1319\n01:04:08,942 --> 01:04:12,907\nBecause if you look at a network by SIDS\nthat's gonna be in promiscuous mode,\n\n1320\n01:04:12,907 --> 01:04:14,880\nit has to be to do its job.\n\n1321\n01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,070\nBut then again,\nif you look at the network IDS all it is\n\n1322\n01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:24,160\nis a sniffer with the rules engine\nbuilt on top of it telling it how to\n\n1323\n01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:28,620\nparse the traffic and\nall that to look for certain attacks.\n\n1324\n01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:32,580\nSo you don't necessarily want to\nimmediately jump to conclusions that,\n\n1325\n01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:35,060\noh well,\nI've got a malicious sniffer out there.\n\n1326\n01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:39,360\nBut if you run one of these tools and\nyou see something in promiscuous mode but\n\n1327\n01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:45,280\nyou don't really have a utility out\nthere that's doing an IDS function.\n\n1328\n01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:50,182\n>> Yeah, then you're gonna need to\nstart questioning what's going on.\n\n1329\n01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:53,440\nYou know there's ways you\ncan pick this stuff up.\n\n1330\n01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,510\nWireshark will pick up something from\nthis gizmo, you can write a filter for\n\n1331\n01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:58,940\nthat that looks for\nthings in promiscuous mode.\n\n1332\n01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:02,730\nYou know you just got\na lot of stuff out there\n\n1333\n01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:06,750\nthat's designed specifically to look for\nthat card flip in promiscuous mode.\n\n1334\n01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:09,470\nSo if you find it you go and\nask questions.\n\n1335\n01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:12,430\nIn fact there's ways to actually craft\n\n1336\n01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:16,660\nping packets to make them reveal who's\nin promiscuous mode and who's not.\n\n1337\n01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:19,770\n>> So the response comes back a little\nbit differently if the adapter was in\n\n1338\n01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:20,650\npromiscuous mode?\n\n1339\n01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:21,330\n>> Yeah.\n\n1340\n01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:24,040\nI mean, heck,\nif someone's spoofing a Mac address or\n\n1341\n01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,640\nif someone's got a card\nin promiscuous mode.\n\n1342\n01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:29,300\nWell let's just deal with\nthe Promiscuous mode part.\n\n1343\n01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,260\n>> If you send a ping out and\n\n1344\n01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:34,800\nyou craft it the right way, you can\nping a client somewhere on the network.\n\n1345\n01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,915\nAnd what happens is people are gonna\nsee that packet as they go,\n\n1346\n01:05:39,915 --> 01:05:43,520\nthat packet is going\nto go by the stations.\n\n1347\n01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,770\nBut this one station could be in\npromiscuous mode listening for\n\n1348\n01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:50,540\nall of the traffic and,\nas well as the target that gets it.\n\n1349\n01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:52,510\n>> So the ping goes out there,\ngoes to the target.\n\n1350\n01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,260\nAnd that target responds, but\n\n1351\n01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:57,370\nwhen the packet goes by this one,\nthis system sees it.\n\n1352\n01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,640\n>> It says, oh I need to respond to that.\n\n1353\n01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,410\nSo when all of a sudden you fire a ping\nout and then you get two responses back.\n\n1354\n01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:04,000\n>> Yeah.\nAnd so\n\n1355\n01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,040\nnow you're going to look at\ngoing I shouldn't have got that,\n\n1356\n01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:06,550\nit doesn't happen.\n\n1357\n01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:08,900\nThere's two responses\ncoming back to this ping.\n\n1358\n01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:09,670\nOkay.\n\n1359\n01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:14,290\nLet me go track it down to find who's\nthe one that shouldn't be involved here.\n\n1360\n01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:14,790\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1361\n01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,456\nAll right, so\na lot of different types of attacks, and\n\n1362\n01:06:20,456 --> 01:06:24,320\na lot of information that we can use\nto take the next step in an attack.\n\n1363\n01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,340\nUsing these sniffers, very powerful.\n\n1364\n01:06:26,340 --> 01:06:28,430\nAgain I know we said at the beginning,\nI'll say it one more time,\n\n1365\n01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:30,050\nmake sure you have permission.\n\n1366\n01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:32,390\nWe know ethical hacking\nis all about permission.\n\n1367\n01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:35,770\nI think sniffers are just one of those\nones that people think is harmless and\n\n1368\n01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:36,850\nI can download this and\n\n1369\n01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:41,480\nrun it on my computer at work without\nany fear of causing any damage.\n\n1370\n01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,620\nAnd it's not that you're gonna\ncause damage per se, but\n\n1371\n01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:48,040\nthe problem is if you do end up\nsniffing traffic that was confidential\n\n1372\n01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,300\nyou could get in trouble within\nyour organization itself.\n\n1373\n01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,110\nSo make sure you're careful with that.\n\n1374\n01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:53,400\nDon't want to get anybody fired,\n\n1375\n01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,150\nespecially in this day of age\nthe markets the way they are.\n\n1376\n01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:59,122\nSo keep your job, right, be ethical.\n\n1377\n01:06:59,122 --> 01:07:01,800\nAll right, anything else we\nwant to throw in for sniffing?\n\n1378\n01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:03,900\nI think we've got it.\n\n1379\n01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:05,880\nI think we're doing pretty good on that.\n\n1380\n01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:06,720\n>> All right, well good deal.\n\n1381\n01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:11,436\nWell, as always, thanks everybody for\ntuning in to our CEH.\n\n1382\n01:07:11,436 --> 01:07:15,300\nThis was chapter nine with our

another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:37,131\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:38,080\nHow you doing Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,050\n>> Oh, I'm doing good.\n\n7\n00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,400\n>> Good.\nGlad to have you here.\n\n8\n00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,360\nWe are continuing on with our CEH series.\n\n9\n00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,300\nIf you're following along,\n\n10\n00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,990\nwe're going over the CEH Certified\nEthical Hacker Study Guide,\n\n11\n00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,030\nwritten by none other than Mr.\nSean Oriyano.\n\n12\n00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,675\nAnd we are heading into Chapter, and\nI forgot our Chapter number, Sean,\n\n13\n00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:54,240\nChapter 10?\n\n14\n00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,410\n>> Chapter 10.\n\n15\n00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,930\nChapter 10, which is Social Engineering.\n\n16\n00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,003\nLots of fun stuff to do today.\n\n17\n00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:03,602\nYou know, social engineering is one\nof those things that sometimes gets\n\n18\n00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:05,910\noverlooked when it comes to security.\n\n19\n00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:11,170\nBut it really does play a critical part\nin securing our network as well as\n\n20\n00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,720\nit's a really big part of the hacking\nphase or the hacking process.\n\n21\n00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,070\n>> Yes, it's definitely going to\npeek it's head out quite a bit\n\n22\n00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:24,330\nwhen you are going through this whole\nprocess of doing penetration testing.\n\n23\n00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,980\nBecause realistically\nwhen it comes down to it,\n\n24\n00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,800\nyou can put all this technology in place,\nall these great policies in place, but\n\n25\n00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,787\nthe weakest part is still going\nto be that carbon-based element.\n\n26\n00:01:33,787 --> 00:01:36,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That living system is what\n\n27\n00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,510\nwe're really looking at.\n\n28\n00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:38,680\n>> It really is.\n\n29\n00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,600\nWe've used some terms throughout the\nepisodes if you've watched the previous\n\n30\n00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,860\nones or been hanging out with us live.\n\n31\n00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,710\nWe talk about things like there\nis no patch for human stupidity.\n\n32\n00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:51,660\nI know I've seen in the chat room\nthings like the ID10T errors and\n\n33\n00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,740\nthe PEBCAK errors, the problem\nexists between keyboard and chair.\n\n34\n00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,490\nWhat are some other ones you've heard?\n\n35\n00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,710\nI'm sure there's a few more..\n\n36\n00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,010\n>> A Layer 8 problem.\n\n37\n00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:01,198\n>> Layer 8, I like that one.\n\n38\n00:02:01,198 --> 00:02:02,320\nA Layer 8 problem,\n\n39\n00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,150\nso it really is true that the problem\nis that there really is no patch.\n\n40\n00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,070\nWell, they're kinda is a patch, right?\n\n41\n00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,780\nIt comes down to user education, and\nteaching my users what social engineering\n\n42\n00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,710\nis, how to look out for it and\nhow to avoid it and how to handle it.\n\n43\n00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,830\nBut the problem is that doesn't\noccur on a regular basis.\n\n44\n00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,870\nAnd people are really bored\nwith that kinda stuff, so\n\n45\n00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,090\nit's hard to get your\nemployees to buy in sometimes.\n\n46\n00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,350\n>> Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.\n\n47\n00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,860\nIt's just the nature of the beast is,\nso social engineering,\n\n48\n00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,390\nit's not in most people's minds.\n\n49\n00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,180\nMost people when they're\nthinking of security breaches,\n\n50\n00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,080\nthey're expecting something\na little more overtly obvious.\n\n51\n00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,940\nOr they're expecting something\non the technology side.\n\n52\n00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,110\nThey don't expect that person\nto walking up to them, you know,\n\n53\n00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,070\nthat may look completely normal,\nor whatever.\n\n54\n00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,420\nThey don't expect that person to maybe\nbe getting information from them.\n\n55\n00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,850\nOr they expect direct questions,\nlike what's your password or what's this.\n\n56\n00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,230\nThey expect questions like that.\n\n57\n00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,780\nThey don't expect hey,\nI'm gonna ask something over here and\n\n58\n00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,940\nover here and over here.\n\n59\n00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,530\nAnd I'm gonna use all those things\nto infer what something is.\n\n60\n00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,330\nI just don't expect those sorts of things.\n\n61\n00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,300\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n62\n00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,310\nWhen it comes down to it,\nwith a little bit of practice\n\n63\n00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,990\nthis is actually one of the easier parts,\nI think, of the attack.\n\n64\n00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:21,130\nYeah, different people I think some\npeople are more adept at it than others.\n\n65\n00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,905\nWe've all got those friends\nthat could do the old,\n\n66\n00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:25,770\nsell snow to an Eskimo type person.\n\n67\n00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,600\nI think you mentioned the other day that,\nand if anybody's a car salesman,\n\n68\n00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,120\nI don't mean this in a derogatory way,\n\n69\n00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,710\njust a typical stereotyping of\nthat car salesman mentality.\n\n70\n00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:39,170\nThe ability to go up and sell something\nto somebody very convincingly, right?\n\n71\n00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,930\nAnd if you've got that skill set,\n\n72\n00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,900\nit's amazing what information\nyou can get out of people.\n\n73\n00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,660\nCuz we're taking advantage of human\nnature, people want to help other people.\n\n74\n00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,305\nAnd when I say that, people usually go,\nhow, what people do you know?\n\n75\n00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:56,810\nBut in the end, most people do want to\nhelp other people for different reasons.\n\n76\n00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:01,320\nIt could be purely for themselves,\nthey want to better themselves and\n\n77\n00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,480\nthe opinion of others.\n\n78\n00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,640\nThey're looking for that pat on\nthe back or whatever the case may be.\n\n79\n00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,170\nBut, in the end it's not difficult\nto get information out of people.\n\n80\n00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,550\n>> Yeah, it really isn't.\n\n81\n00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,160\nAnd by the way,\n\n82\n00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,210\nI do mean that thing towards car\nsalesmen in a derogatory sense.\n\n83\n00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,770\nSo, deal with it.\n\n84\n00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,930\nAll right, so I'm not a politician or\ndiplomat people.\n\n85\n00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,920\nDeal with it.\n\n86\n00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:26,342\nSo it's an ethics class,\nnot a courtesy class.\n\n87\n00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:32,750\nSo, yeah, there's really a lot of ways,\nI mean, to put it out there.\n\n88\n00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,580\nThere's really a lot of ways\nyou can do social engineering.\n\n89\n00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,337\nIt can be by people wanting\nto better themselves.\n\n90\n00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:44,530\nIt could be through people just\ntalking too much is another one.\n\n91\n00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,970\nIt's exploiting trust.\n\n92\n00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,780\nIt's exploiting habits.\n\n93\n00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,300\nI mean there's just so many things that\ncan be exploited in basic human nature.\n\n94\n00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,820\nWith human beings that\nit just takes someone\n\n95\n00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,980\nthat's very adept and can see those\nthings and is aware of those things.\n\n96\n00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,180\nEven things like body language.\n\n97\n00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,560\nThey can see those things and read them,\nand put the whole thing together.\n\n98\n00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,130\n>> Absolutely.\nAnd\n\n99\n00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,260\na little lubrication never helps either,\nright?\n\n100\n00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:12,810\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n101\n00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,702\n>> Get them in the right scenario and\nthe information just flows.\n\n102\n00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:19,370\nAll right, so lots of different\ntypes of social engineering,\n\n103\n00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,550\ndifferent ways we can go about\ndoing social engineering.\n\n104\n00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,010\nWhere do we even wanna start this?\n\n105\n00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,975\nThe human to human type thing?\n\n106\n00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:31,400\n>> Well, let's talk about some of the, I\nthink it's good to start out with some of\n\n107\n00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,840\nthe things actually that make\nsocial engineering possible.\n\n108\n00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,359\n>> Okay\n>> That's probably a good place to start.\n\n109\n00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,320\nAnd by the way when I think\nlubrication to help socials work,\n\n110\n00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,690\nI think tequila or vodka.\n\n111\n00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,270\n>> That makes it way easier.\n\n112\n00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,230\n>> Yeah, skip the beer,\ngo right to the hard stuff.\n\n113\n00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,340\nGet the tequila out and\n\n114\n00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,880\nthat's when you're gonna start\ngetting some really good information.\n\n115\n00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,670\nFor the first 30 to 45 minutes, right?\n\n116\n00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> Then after that the information becomes\n\n117\n00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,810\nnot so reliable.\n\n118\n00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,305\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or easy to understand.\n\n119\n00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:01,080\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> One tequila,\n\n120\n00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,155\ntwo tequila, three tequila, floor.\n\n121\n00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:03,710\n>> [LAUGH] There you go.\n\n122\n00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,450\nYou've got to get the information\nout in between three and floor.\n\n123\n00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,505\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n124\n00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:13,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what makes social engineering work?\n\n125\n00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,650\nThere's a number of\nthings that make it work.\n\n126\n00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,830\nThe core human behaviors\nthat make it work are,\n\n127\n00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:25,260\nthe fact that human beings do have\nthe tendency to trust, that's built in.\n\n128\n00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,790\nAnd I know there's always someone\nwithin earshot that says well,\n\n129\n00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,440\nI don't trust anybody.\n\n130\n00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,795\nThat's learned behavior,\nthat's definitely learned behavior.\n\n131\n00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:40,720\nBecause one of the things I put out\nthere is that it's learned behavior to\n\n132\n00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160\nthink about it.\n\n133\n00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,990\nYour parents didn't tell\nyou when you were kids\n\n134\n00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,120\ntold you not to trust strangers as\na kid because they knew hey, you trust,\n\n135\n00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,830\nyou're a kid, you're gonna trust people\nthat's just your default behavior.\n\n136\n00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,638\nAnd human beings, even the ones\nthat say they don't trust people,\n\n137\n00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:56,670\nwill trust people if you\npush the right buttons.\n\n138\n00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,211\n>> Yeah.\n\n139\n00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:58,423\n>> It's there.\n\n140\n00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:02,360\nI could have the biggest\nwhack job on the planet.\n\n141\n00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,495\nBut if I know the right things to say to\nthat person by looking at who they are and\n\n142\n00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,700\nkinda empathizing with them.\n\n143\n00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,493\nThings like that.\n\n144\n00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:13,170\nI can start building that trust.\n\n145\n00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,320\nOnce I have that trust, then its\na question of how I exploit that at\n\n146\n00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,335\nthat point\n>> It seems so twisted, right?\n\n147\n00:07:20,335 --> 00:07:21,930\nHere's a person that\ndoesn't trust anybody.\n\n148\n00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,480\nYou finally get him to trust some body and\nthen, turn around and\n\n149\n00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,160\nstab him in the back and\ntake all his information that he has.\n\n150\n00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,420\nBut yeah it is true,\nwe are by nature a trusting people,\n\n151\n00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,310\nwe're social creatures right?\n\n152\n00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,140\nFor the most part, I know a few of us\nmaybe aren't, but for the most part we\n\n153\n00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,650\nare social creatures and we love\nthat interaction with other people.\n\n154\n00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,010\nAnd we love to be able to, we gotta\nhave somebody to vent to half the time.\n\n155\n00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,670\nI mean those are great\npeople to get a hold of.\n\n156\n00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,447\nSomebody that's angry, disgruntled.\n\n157\n00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:47,983\n>> Absolutely\n>> So you get them and\n\n158\n00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:51,357\nthey'll just start dadadada,\njust complaining about everything.\n\n159\n00:07:51,357 --> 00:07:55,107\nAnd in the meantime, you're just\ngathering all this information.\n\n160\n00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,010\n>> Yeah, sometimes your exactly right.\n\n161\n00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,116\nSome of that disgruntled, all it is Is\njust poking the hornet's nest a bit,\n\n162\n00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:02,156\nto get them going.\n\n163\n00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:05,490\nJust poke them enough and\nthey won't shut up, right?\n\n164\n00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,500\nWe've all seen that type of person that\nyou see as angry, and all you've got\n\n165\n00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,240\nto do is say something that just is\ngoing to trigger it, and they will go.\n\n166\n00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,352\nThey'll just keep going and\ngoing and going so,\n\n167\n00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:20,690\nthere's things that make this happen.\n\n168\n00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,250\nThat would be one of behaviors,\nthat thing of trust.\n\n169\n00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,660\nYou speak the person's language,\n\n170\n00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,560\nyou do your research, and\nthat's something out there.\n\n171\n00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,610\nIf you select a target, you're going to\nneed to do your research on that person,\n\n172\n00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,530\nthat individual.\n\n173\n00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,810\nThat's where that footprinting\nstuff comes back into play.\n\n174\n00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,030\nAnd that's where just kind of being\nan astute observer comes into play.\n\n175\n00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,840\nAnd once you get that it can build that\ntrust, then that's where you move in and\n\n176\n00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,870\nstart exploiting things at that point.\n\n177\n00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,730\nBut you've got to build\nsome level of trust to\n\n178\n00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,580\nreally do the face to\nface stuff really well.\n\n179\n00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,030\n>> Yeah you do\n>> And\n\n180\n00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,795\nthat's just one behavior\nthat you can exploit.\n\n181\n00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:01,000\nThere's plenty of others\nthat we can talk about, and\n\n182\n00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,600\nwe'll talk about,\nthat actually make this happen.\n\n183\n00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,810\n>> Yeah, we've started looking\nat things like trust, and\n\n184\n00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:13,530\nthen others are people want\nrecognition among their peers,\n\n185\n00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,960\nthey want to look smart, have people\napprove of what they're saying and\n\n186\n00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,740\nthings like that or their behavior,\nso really easy to take advantage of.\n\n187\n00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,580\nOh, absolutely.\n\n188\n00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,780\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n189\n00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,190\nYou can say one of the other ones\nthat comes into play is that human\n\n190\n00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,680\nnature side of it too, there's certain\nthings that every human being will do.\n\n191\n00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,505\nYeah, trust is one of them, but trust\ncan be broken off into it's own thing.\n\n192\n00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:43,926\nThere's certain things that human\nbeings tend to develop and tend to do.\n\n193\n00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:49,047\nAnd if you're aware of that,\nthat stuff will help you.\n\n194\n00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:53,659\nThe way people interact,\nlike in social situations or\n\n195\n00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:58,960\ncertain norms,\nthat people expect to be adhered to.\n\n196\n00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,980\nThose things you can exploit.\n\n197\n00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,995\nYou can change your behavior\nto fit a certain environment.\n\n198\n00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,810\nAnd once your behavior\nfits that environment,\n\n199\n00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,500\nno one asks you any questions.\n\n200\n00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,146\nIt's kind of like something we've been\ntalking about during the week, or\n\n201\n00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:19,010\nduring our previous episodes and\nall of that.\n\n202\n00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,250\nOne of the things that came up was\njust act like you belong there.\n\n203\n00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,710\n>> Right.\n>> If you act like you belong there,\n\n204\n00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,450\nthat goes a long, long way.\n\n205\n00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,536\nIf you have your shoulders back and\nyou're walking confidently,\n\n206\n00:10:31,536 --> 00:10:35,870\nit's really going to\nhelp the situation out.\n\n207\n00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,490\nPeople are going to be less\nlikely to question you.\n\n208\n00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,140\nIt doesn't mean they won't, but\nit means they're less likely to.\n\n209\n00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,610\n>> Or even if they do question you,\n\n210\n00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,420\nthey might be more willing to accept your\nanswer than if you're sitting there,\n\n211\n00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,650\nacting all timid, and you've got\nsweat pouring down your forehead,\n\n212\n00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,710\ndripping off your chin, and\nyou don't look like you belong there or\n\n213\n00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,305\nsomething's wrong, that's when\nthey might go hm, wait a second.\n\n214\n00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:02,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n215\n00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,575\n>> Sometimes they give you\nthe information anyway.\n\n216\n00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:07,050\nSo we can do it human to human and\ntake advantage of that.\n\n217\n00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,080\nAnd there's just several different ways\nwe can go about doing social engineering.\n\n218\n00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,640\nIt really is a fascinating, there's\nbooks on this topic in and of itself.\n\n219\n00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,807\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> You can go out there and\n\n220\n00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:18,050\nyou can do a lot of research.\n\n221\n00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,840\nShawn does a great job covering it,\nof course, in his book.\n\n222\n00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:25,530\nBut there's a lot of information out there\nabout good social engineering techniques.\n\n223\n00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,391\n>> Yeah, there´s a lot of it.\n\n224\n00:11:27,391 --> 00:11:32,255\nThere's a lot of different things\nout there that you can use as tools\n\n225\n00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:34,225\nin your arsenal.\n\n226\n00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:39,185\nSo yeah, we've just talked about a couple\nbut, there are even others on top of that.\n\n227\n00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:43,755\nI think we can mention stuff like, act\nlike you're in a position of authority.\n\n228\n00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:45,405\nName dropping works.\n\n229\n00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,605\n>> Yep, name dropping.\n\n230\n00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:51,835\n>> You hear that,\nwearing someone else's authority.\n\n231\n00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:52,580\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n232\n00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,300\n>> If you do that, that,\nwill sometimes get you some leverage.\n\n233\n00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,984\nAct, or give it,\nkind of preying on that person's moral\n\n234\n00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,040\nobligation-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n235\n00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,570\n>> To help you out, making them feel\nlike this is the right thing to do,\n\n236\n00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,852\nwill get you some traction.\n\n237\n00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:13,670\nIt's amazing what you can do if you\ntell someone, if you kind of get\n\n238\n00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,060\nin on someone's, hey, this is\nsomething that we really need to do,\n\n239\n00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,430\nit's the right thing to do,\npeople will go, will throw a lot of\n\n240\n00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,295\nstuff out the window to help you out if\nthey think it's the right thing to do.\n\n241\n00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:28,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If you convince them.\n\n242\n00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,482\nYou know, of that.\n\n243\n00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,610\nS there's, that's just one of\nthe many things you can do.\n\n244\n00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,360\nAnd then what I always like to\nthrow into this whole mix is,\n\n245\n00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,440\njust the way you dress can buy you.\n\n246\n00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,770\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Can buy some traction.\n\n247\n00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,650\n>> Yeah I know, I saw a couple comments in\nthe chatroom about that very thing, and\n\n248\n00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,513\nit's really about trying\nto dress appropriately.\n\n249\n00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:50,958\n>> Dressing nice and definitely fit in\nin certain environments, like if it was\n\n250\n00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,570\na business setting and office environment,\nyou can come in with a button down shirt\n\n251\n00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,130\nand a tie, you look like maybe you're\nupper management, or somebody important.\n\n252\n00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,210\nLess willing to question you, but\n\n253\n00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,030\nif you're going to go try to talk to those\nloading dock guys at the bar after work,\n\n254\n00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,120\nyou might get more information\ndressed down a little bit, you know?\n\n255\n00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,160\nMore like them and saying hey, yeah, I do\nthe same thing over at this company x y z.\n\n256\n00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,274\nGet the conversation flowing and\nstart talking like that.\n\n257\n00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:21,920\nSo you're going to dress very important,\nyou go to Goodwill,\n\n258\n00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,270\nyou go to Salvation Army,\nyou go to good garage sales,\n\n259\n00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,070\nand any time you see a work shirt or\nsomething, grab it.\n\n260\n00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,110\nCouple bucks for\nan old phone company shirt.\n\n261\n00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:36,230\nKeep it in your closet, and\nthat starts building up your wardrobe.\n\n262\n00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,460\n>> Yeah, criminals-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,790\n>> You know who you are.\n\n264\n00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,910\n>> Not that I would ever do that,\n\n265\n00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,300\nI don't have a whole collection\nof work shirts at my house.\n\n266\n00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,830\nNo.\n>> Not recommended.\n\n267\n00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,624\nDo not try this at home.\n\n268\n00:13:47,624 --> 00:13:51,590\n>> [LAUGH] Ball caps with the logos\non it and things like that.\n\n269\n00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,108\nSo, get your tool belt.\n\n270\n00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:55,495\nYou've got to have one of those, so\nyou can walk into the phone closet.\n\n271\n00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:59,420\n[LAUGH] That kind of thing.\n\n272\n00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,920\n>> These things absolutely do work,\nand in fact,\n\n273\n00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,000\nit doesn't even need to be a work shirt.\n\n274\n00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,860\nAll you need is something that looks\ndecent, and just get one of those badges,\n\n275\n00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,930\noh, I'm a contractor, I don't\nactually work for that other company.\n\n276\n00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,647\nIf you have the jargon down,\nand you look and act the part,\n\n277\n00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:21,090\nit's still going to work.\n\n278\n00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,150\n>> Right.\n>> You know that's the thing,\n\n279\n00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:27,780\nyou know people will say, okay, well yeah,\nyou're a contractor, so you don't work,\n\n280\n00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,445\nokay I get it.\n\n281\n00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:29,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n282\n00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,252\n>> Sometimes they just look for\nthat little badge to be stuck on there,\n\n283\n00:14:33,252 --> 00:14:36,113\nlooking at it, as long as you\nsee something kinda sparkly or\n\n284\n00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,100\nwhatever-\n>> Right.\n\n285\n00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,180\n>> Flopping around.\n\n286\n00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,110\nOh yeah, that's fine.\n\n287\n00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,650\n>> Absolutely.\n\n288\n00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,860\n>> That's totally fine.\n\n289\n00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,840\n>> I mean I've got a cheapo little\nlamination device at my house.\n\n290\n00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,200\nI can print whatever I want,\nlaminate that bad boy.\n\n291\n00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,795\n>> You've got a lamination\ndevice at your house?\n\n292\n00:14:47,795 --> 00:14:50,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You never know\n\n293\n00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,650\nwhen you're going to need\na badge to get in somewhere.\n\n294\n00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,430\nYou just Google it, you find a picture\nof it, print it out, you trim it up,\n\n295\n00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,080\nlaminate it; you're good to go.\n\n296\n00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,700\n>> I think this is a good point in time to\nadvertise Mike's drivers license service,\n\n297\n00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,860\nif you need one.\n\n298\n00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,190\n>> He's got you hooked up [LAUGH]\nspecial for ITPro listeners.\n\n299\n00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:09,730\n>> That's right.\n\n300\n00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,880\n>> Fast forward nothing.\n\n301\n00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,910\n[LAUGH]\n>> Send me your picture and\n\n302\n00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,493\nI can come from any state you want.\n\n303\n00:15:14,493 --> 00:15:18,250\n[LAUGH]\nSo it is habit,\n\n304\n00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,190\nand having those tools\navailable can definitely help.\n\n305\n00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,305\nI'm not as slick, I don't think,\nwith the verbal sometimes.\n\n306\n00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:26,950\nSo having some of that other stuff can\nreally make it a little bit easier.\n\n307\n00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,920\n>> Yeah, it's really is a total package.\n\n308\n00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:34,789\nIf you're really good,\nyou can rely one or maybe two.\n\n309\n00:15:34,789 --> 00:15:38,700\nBut if you're not, it kind of helps\nputting the whole package together, and\n\n310\n00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,970\nthen that will get you the leverage\nwhen you talk to somebody, or\n\n311\n00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,810\ninteract with them in any way,\nshape, or form.\n\n312\n00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,780\nI may not even have to be talking to\nthem directly, just might be a fact that\n\n313\n00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,279\nI'm doing something else, I'm looking\nthrough some files, or doing whatever.\n\n314\n00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:58,862\nJust because I look the right way, that\nperson may not want even to come over and\n\n315\n00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:01,790\nchallenge me to see,\nwhat are you doing that for?\n\n316\n00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,727\nIt's just the way it is But,\nit's actually kind of amazing\n\n317\n00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:11,169\nwhat you can do with just\na few changes in your loo,k or\n\n318\n00:16:11,169 --> 00:16:16,250\nchanges in your behavior what\npeople will actually assume.\n\n319\n00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:16,950\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n320\n00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,370\nI always like stories like, you watch this\nplace, you scope this out a little bit.\n\n321\n00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,250\nYou notice that every afternoon,\nthere's three or\n\n322\n00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,130\nfour workers that walk right across the\nstreet over to that bar and sit there for\n\n323\n00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,632\nan hour or two and then they split up.\n\n324\n00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:37,110\nAnd so, what you do is you go, all right,\nI'm going to go ahead and grab myself, and\n\n325\n00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,505\nI know they're going to be\ncoming out at about 5:15.\n\n326\n00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:41,370\nSo, at 5:05, I walk into that bar and\n\n327\n00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,340\nI sit down at their normal spot and start\nhaving a drink, and then they come in.\n\n328\n00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,020\nThey sit down.\n\n329\n00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,330\nThey're having their drink, and,\nyou start making casual conversation.\n\n330\n00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,850\nGosh, my job sucks.\n\n331\n00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,030\nI gotta change my password every 45 days,\nand\n\n332\n00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,350\nthe darn thing's gotta be\nseven characters long.\n\n333\n00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,110\nThey're just driving me crazy.\n\n334\n00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,980\nAnd they look over to you and go, 45 days?\n\n335\n00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,240\nBut we gotta change ours every 30 days and\nit has to be ten characters long.\n\n336\n00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,480\nWell what did I just get?\n\n337\n00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,870\nI just got their password policy.\n\n338\n00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,130\nSo little things like that,\njust sparking that conversation.\n\n339\n00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,080\nFinding something, as Sean said,\n\n340\n00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,250\nfinding something you have common with\nthem that you can talk about, and\n\n341\n00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,960\nthe more footprinting you've done,\nthe more information you have.\n\n342\n00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,730\nIf you've gone in and picked out a couple\nindividuals, it kind of reminds me of\n\n343\n00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,440\nthe movies, when they're looking for the\none individual that has all the debt and\n\n344\n00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,340\nthe loans, and that's the one\nwe're going to try to bribe.\n\n345\n00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,410\nIt's the same concept.\n\n346\n00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,330\nYou are looking for the weakest link, or\nthe one that you might have the easiest\n\n347\n00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,290\ntime connecting with, that you can\nget the most information out of.\n\n348\n00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,318\n>> Yeah, and absolutely.\n\n349\n00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:45,247\nIt just fascinates me\nthe type of stuff possible.\n\n350\n00:17:45,247 --> 00:17:46,198\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n351\n00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:50,540\n>> Really here\n>> Yeah, there's so much that you can do.\n\n352\n00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,760\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n353\n00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,110\n>> You've got a place that's\ngot the key pad out front,\n\n354\n00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,910\nyou've gotta swipe a card to get in.\n\n355\n00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,592\nWell, what you do is you wait until,\nabout 12:45,\n\n356\n00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:04,210\n12:50, when people are starting\nto come back from lunch.\n\n357\n00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,770\n>> And, so\nyou've got your little brown shirt on, and\n\n358\n00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:11,530\nyou've grabbed a whole bunch of boxes, and\nyou wait until you see some cars pull in.\n\n359\n00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,500\nThere's gonna be a group of\npeople walking up to the door.\n\n360\n00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,580\nAnd so you head up to the door, as\nthey're getting out of their car, and so\n\n361\n00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,450\nnow you're up at that door holding\nthese boxes and trying to reach in and\n\n362\n00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:22,770\nget your card out of your pockets so\nyou can scan it.\n\n363\n00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:25,130\nYou don't have a card,\nbut they don't know that.\n\n364\n00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:27,380\nThey see you struggling with it and\nwhat are they going to do?\n\n365\n00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,560\nThey're going to hold the door for you.\n\n366\n00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,285\nThey're going to let you right in,\nmost likely.\n\n367\n00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:36,293\nIt's just some of the things we can\ndo to take advantage of people.\n\n368\n00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:39,560\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's one way to do it.\n\n369\n00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,515\nThat's like a moral obligation thing.\n\n370\n00:18:41,515 --> 00:18:42,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like, oh, I've got to help\n\n371\n00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,300\nthis dude out.\n\n372\n00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,980\nLook at him.\n\n373\n00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,240\nI've been in that situation,\nthey can relate to that sort of thing, so\n\n374\n00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,380\nthey wanna help you out.\n\n375\n00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,970\nI was talking about the human\nhabit thing earlier,\n\n376\n00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,800\nwhat about someone holding a door open for\nyou?\n\n377\n00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,460\n>> Right.\n\n378\n00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,290\n>> They're all like, hey come on in.\n\n379\n00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,060\nWe've been taught from a very young\nage that's the courteous thing to do.\n\n380\n00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:06,697\n>> Right.\n>> So there's certain things that you can\n\n381\n00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:10,321\nprey upon if you are aware of it.\n\n382\n00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:14,374\nAnd if you're really a kind of\na student of human behavior and\n\n383\n00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:19,062\npay attention to the way people\ninteract and the way people do things,\n\n384\n00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:22,084\nyou're paying attention to those details,\n\n385\n00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:26,872\nyou can start figuring out how you're\ngoing to leverage those things.\n\n386\n00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:27,407\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n387\n00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:32,470\n>> I mean, it really is amazing what you,\nand these tools\n\n388\n00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,195\nin the hands of a good social engineer\nare almost like magic watching it happen.\n\n389\n00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,772\n>> Mm-hm.\nYou won't even believe it when you see it.\n\n390\n00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:40,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know what's going on,\n\n391\n00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,890\nyou're just like whoa,\nwhat just happened there?\n\n392\n00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,390\n>> It's like watching a good magician.\n\n393\n00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:45,480\nYou know it's not real but\n\n394\n00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,760\nsomehow you're seeing it right\nthere in front of your eyes.\n\n395\n00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,020\n>> And Jeff has a good comment\nin the chat room there.\n\n396\n00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,765\nStanding around the smoke hole and\nwaiting for people to come out and smoke.\n\n397\n00:19:53,765 --> 00:19:56,720\nSo, another great place\nto kind of hang out and\n\n398\n00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,090\nit's easy to strike up\ncasual conversation.\n\n399\n00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,830\nSo, yeah.\nAbsolutely, any situation like that.\n\n400\n00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,300\nThe break area,\n\n401\n00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,220\nthe bar across the street after work-\n>> Yeah,\n\n402\n00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,460\nit's also great to start\ngetting places like that.\n\n403\n00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,905\nThat's where people's\ndefenses are dropped.\n\n404\n00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n405\n00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,250\n>> That's the time for just shooting\nthe breeze, and stuff like that.\n\n406\n00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,828\n>> Right.\n>> And just get right in there.\n\n407\n00:20:18,828 --> 00:20:20,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know?\n\n408\n00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,770\n>> And\nwhat kind of information are you getting?\n\n409\n00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,670\nYou might be getting password policies.\n\n410\n00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,740\nYou're probably not gonna get their\nactual password just asking them, maybe.\n\n411\n00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,300\nMaybe you can, depending on what\navenue you're going through.\n\n412\n00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:33,080\n>> But even then, even if it's just\ncasual conversation, you can learn so\n\n413\n00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,540\nmuch about the person.\n\n414\n00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,590\nRemember we talked about password\ncracking and to guess their password.\n\n415\n00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,000\nA lot of people have passwords that\nhave to do with something in their life,\n\n416\n00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,380\nsomething easy to remember.\n\n417\n00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,655\nSo if we start talking about,\noh, my anniversary is this month.\n\n418\n00:20:45,655 --> 00:20:47,340\nThen they say oh, mine was last month.\n\n419\n00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,560\nOh, really?\nWhat day?\n\n420\n00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,100\nIt's Friday.\nReally?\n\n421\n00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,720\nMine too.\n\n422\n00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,460\nHow about that?\n\n423\n00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,132\nThings like that, and start getting\nbirthdays, anniversaries, kid's names,\n\n424\n00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,400\ndog's names.\n\n425\n00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,600\nThat can go a long way to making that\nfile that I'll want to do some password\n\n426\n00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,290\nguessing with.\n\n427\n00:21:00,835 --> 00:21:02,150\nGosh, the list just goes on.\n\n428\n00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,830\nIt's just amazing what you can get.\n\n429\n00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,190\n>> Yeah just FYI.\n\n430\n00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,885\nIf it's a guy and he says he knows\nhis anniversary, he's lying.\n\n431\n00:21:09,885 --> 00:21:11,625\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just doesn't happen.\n\n432\n00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,900\n>> No, with smart phones,\nman it reminds me now.\n\n433\n00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,335\nI get a one month reminder, a two week\nreminder, and a oh shit reminder.\n\n434\n00:21:18,335 --> 00:21:20,199\n[LAUGH]\n>> Whatever.\n\n435\n00:21:20,199 --> 00:21:24,460\nI have reminder setup.\n\n436\n00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,600\nI forget my anniversary.\n\n437\n00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,935\nMy girlfriend tells me.\n\n438\n00:21:26,935 --> 00:21:29,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it's kinda like a reminder.\n\n439\n00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,520\nI feel it in the back of my head.\n\n440\n00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,003\nIt's our anniversary.\n\n441\n00:21:34,003 --> 00:21:35,037\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, burning through your head.\n\n442\n00:21:35,037 --> 00:21:36,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> Look.\n\n443\n00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,820\nYeah, exactly.\n\n444\n00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,910\n>> Is it that time of year?\n\n445\n00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,555\nDidn't we have an anniversary last year?\n\n446\n00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:42,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n447\n00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,900\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] So, and to continue on,\n\n448\n00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,000\nso, a lot of the work that\nwe're talking about so\n\n449\n00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,420\nfar is really dealing with\ndirect human interaction.\n\n450\n00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,720\nBut there's other methods, I guess.\n\n451\n00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,480\nWe maybe wanna save some of those for\nthe later segment here,\n\n452\n00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,700\nbut there's many different ways that we\ncan go about doing social engineering.\n\n453\n00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,913\nSocial engineering is not\njust talking to somebody and\n\n454\n00:21:59,913 --> 00:22:01,751\ntrying to get that information out, right?\n\n455\n00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:03,806\nThere's a lot more to it than that.\n\n456\n00:22:03,806 --> 00:22:06,354\n>> Yeah, there's definitely a lot to it.\n\n457\n00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:11,495\nThere's so much information\nout there that can be gotten\n\n458\n00:22:11,495 --> 00:22:16,510\nthrough social engineering,\nit's staggering.\n\n459\n00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,441\nI would suggest if you're gonna do this,\n\n460\n00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:23,505\nthis is just an intro to social and\njournal or doing here.\n\n461\n00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:27,990\nBut, they've used it in one of\nthe ones they cite as a good example\n\n462\n00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,500\nis that movie \"Catch Me If You Can\".\n\n463\n00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,240\nIn the book it was based on,\nthere is a book it was based,\n\n464\n00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,360\nwhich gets into more into it.\n\n465\n00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,050\nThere's a book called\n\"The Art of Deception\",\n\n466\n00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:42,090\nwhich is another one that\nreally gets in depth into it.\n\n467\n00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,528\nThere's plenty of resources for it, if\nyou really want to dig into being kind of\n\n468\n00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:51,160\na really good social engineer,\nthere's lots of resources for it.\n\n469\n00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,140\nWe're going to introduce you\nto a lot of that here, but\n\n470\n00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,200\nit's good to kind of see some examples,\nand I've got plenty of examples that I'm\n\n471\n00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,752\ngoing to talk about though here-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n472\n00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:03,030\n>> Of how people used various\nsocial engineering techniques, and\n\n473\n00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:08,850\nused them in different combinations\nto get the results that they wanted.\n\n474\n00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,740\n>> Right.\n\n475\n00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,610\n>> And that's the thing,\nif you can develop the skill, it's a very,\n\n476\n00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,790\nvery powerful weapon, because the people\nthat interact with the network, interact\n\n477\n00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:20,565\nwith the technology, interact with that\nenvironment, they are the soft target.\n\n478\n00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They are the ones that are going to\n\n479\n00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,930\nmake mistakes.\n\n480\n00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:26,670\nYou just know that's gonna happen.\n\n481\n00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,010\n>> RIght.\n>> There's things, laziness,\n\n482\n00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,115\nthere's things like that\ntrust we talked about.\n\n483\n00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:31,950\n>> Mm-hm\n>> There's things like\n\n484\n00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,750\ndoing thing the same way.\n\n485\n00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:39,260\nHumans have this thing of just\nwanting to do stuff the same way over,\n\n486\n00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260\nand over, and over again.\n\n487\n00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,715\nI remember it was introduced to me.\n\n488\n00:23:42,715 --> 00:23:46,921\nI hadn't really thought about it before,\nuntil it was pointed out,\n\n489\n00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:51,561\nwas, when I was going through my flight\nschool, my flight instructor was,\n\n490\n00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:56,348\nbasically, every time when I would do\nsomething, he would tell me, he says,\n\n491\n00:23:56,348 --> 00:23:59,056\nyou gotta learn to do\nthe do it the right way.\n\n492\n00:23:59,056 --> 00:24:03,717\nIt's clear that really early on,\nhe says if you get these habits set,\n\n493\n00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:08,711\neven though it still gets the results\nyou want Is getting these habits set.\n\n494\n00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:11,835\nThat's what you'll default to when\nsomething bad happens cuz that's been\n\n495\n00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:14,340\nprogrammed in,\nthey call it the law of primacy.\n\n496\n00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,910\nYou know, the first way you've learned and\n\n497\n00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:19,205\ngot hard coded in,\neven if you change that behavior later on.\n\n498\n00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:23,380\nIf under the right stressful conditions\nyou will default back to that.\n\n499\n00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,570\nAnd that's something you can,\n\n500\n00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,590\nif you know, you can use against\nsomeone if you know they.\n\n501\n00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,160\nMay have had some problems learning how to\ndo a job or do a task, stress them out.\n\n502\n00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,980\n>> Right.\n>> That, you can

--> 00:25:17,904\nyou can stress someone out to you know,\nthrow stuff at them.\n\n521\n00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:20,870\nAnd heck if you could approach someone\nwhen a whole bunch of other people\n\n522\n00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,980\nare approaching them\n>> Mm-hm\n\n523\n00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,100\n>> And start asking questions.\n\n524\n00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,890\nTheir stressed

as a prime example,\nwhen I teach some classes for\n\n536\n00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,170\na certain company we.\n\n537\n00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,110\nI'll have access so\nthat I can see the student's machines and\n\n538\n00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:46,850\nI can watch them type.\n\n539\n00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:49,690\nLet's say we're doing some PowerShell\ncommands and things like that.\n\n540\n00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,760\nAnd I'm watching them type and\nthey're fine typing.\n\n541\n00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,790\nI'll see them making a single typo.\n\n542\n00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,510\nThey'll get that red text\nback in Powershell and\n\n543\n00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,460\nI'll tell them what you missed was this.\n\n544\n00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,880\nNow they know I'm watching them,\nand they can't type for anything.\n\n545\n00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,630\nWell I mean they all of\na sudden they can't spell the.\n\n546\n00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,800\nI mean it's crazy.\n\n547\n00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,150\nBut that's the same kind of thing we can\ntake advantage of in social engineering.\n\n548\n00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,170\nYou put a little pressure on them and\npeople start to slip up.\n\n549\n00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,920\nYou know, they lose their you know, their\nfacade that they've been putting on and,\n\n550\n00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,110\nand they, as you said,\nthey slip back into old habits.\n\n551\n00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,010\nWhich might not be the most appropriate.\n\n552\n00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:23,945\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n553\n00:26:23,945 --> 00:26:26,850\nAnd I you know,\nI saw someone ask it the other day.\n\n554\n00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,150\nI've even gone through and used..\n\n555\n00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,870\nIt's a messed up approach.\n\n556\n00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,655\nI think it's funny.\n\n557\n00:26:32,655 --> 00:26:35,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've used it where I will\n\n558\n00:26:36,460

about is their,\nis their rage or something in there.\n\n564\n00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:50,870\nAnd then that's when I slip\nsomething in or start trying to,\n\n565\n00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:53,530\nI start trying to guide\nthe conversation towards something.\n\n566\n00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,200\nI'll get it.\n\n567\n00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,340\n[LAUGH] I'll get it quite often.\n\n568\n00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,140\nYou know.\n\n569\n00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,040\n>> Absolutely.\n\n570\n00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,800\nAnother thing can be timing, right?\n\n571\n00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,990\nIf I go up to somebody at 11:50,\nknowing that their lunch break is at noon.\n\n572\n00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,920\nAnd I start into some deep thing that\nthey're gonna have to help me with or\n\n573\n00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,010\nsomething like that.\n\n574\n00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,150\nYou know, they're gonna try to\nget it done quick or, again,\n\n575\n00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,780\nright before closing time.\n\n576\n00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,360\nYou get people in a hurry and\n\n577\n00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,850\nit's kind of the same thing\nas stressing them out, right?\n\n578\n00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,617\nThey're gonna slip back\ninto their old habits or\n\n579\n00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:18,930\nthey're gonna take shortcuts\nbecause they wanna leave.\n\n580\n00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,550\nThey're starving.\n\n581\n00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,230\nTheir friends are waiting for\nthem in the car

some\nof those kind of situations, as well.\n\n584\n00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,670\nSo just a whole ton of different\ntechniques and not every one works.\n\n585\n00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,389\n>>

that's\ngonna work in every situation.\n\n593\n00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:53,220\nThe important thing is to learn\nall these different techniques and\n\n594\n00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,950\nthen have practice on them, whatever\nyou've got to do and refine them and.\n\n595\n00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,290\nThen be able to pull out\nany one at any time,\n\n596\n00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,130\ngiven the

--> 00:28:16,017\nWe come back, we're gonna continue\non with more Social Engineering, so\n\n602\n00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:18,066\nstay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n603\n00:28:18,066 --> 00:28:23,466\n[MUSIC]\n\n604\n00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:25,290\nAll right welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n605\n00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,980\nWe're continuing on with our\nsocial engineering chapter where\n\n606\n00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,860\nwe're learning how we can take\nadvantage of human nature.\n\n607\n00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,360\nSo, what's next on our\nsocial engineering agenda?\n\n608\n00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,530\n>> Well, they you know,\nwe wanna look at is,\n\n609\n00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:43,960\nthere's actually two main areas where you\ncan apply social engineering techniques.\n\n610\n00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,450\nOne of them is face to face,\nof course, and\n\n611\n00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:50,870\nthat's the one that a lot of people think\nof when they think of social engineering.\n\n612\n00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,620\nBut then there's also, the stuff\nthat takes place over technology,\n\n613\n00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,360\nusing computers.\n\n614\n00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,760\nAnd, all the, all the technology\nwe have available to use nowadays.\n\n615\n00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,880\nNow, they both can be equally effective.\n\n616\n00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,680\nIt just, you know depends on how you\npursue a particular avenue if you use it\n\n617\n00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:13,620\nto its fullest extent, or if you know, or\nif your familiar really familiar with it.\n\n618\n00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,100\nYou know,\njust kind of some different things.\n\n619\n00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,100\nWhat may work in face to face\nisn't necessarily gonna work in\n\n620\n00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,100\nthe technology to use it against a person.\n\n621\n00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,390\n>> When we say using technology,\n\n622\n00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,470\nwe're talking about things like\nmaybe phone calls or emails.\n\n623\n00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,250\nOr social media.\n\n624\n00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,790\n>> Absolutely, absolutely\n>> Things like that.\n\n625\n00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,970\n>> Instant messaging\n>> Yeah.\n\n626\n00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:35,650\n>> You know, text messages.\n\n627\n00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,340\nAll those things you know,\ncan and do work.\n\n628\n00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:38,952\n>> Absolutely.\n>> And\n\n629\n00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:43,950\nit's a people are very prone to being\nmanipulated through their technology,\n\n630\n00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,424\nyou know, especially nowadays.\n\n631\n00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,110\n>> Mm-hm\n>> You know a few years ago that may not\n\n632\n00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,846\nhave been the case, but nowadays\nyou know people we've all seen it.\n\n633\n00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:54,490\nThat people are, if their in a group\nthey're much more likely even if\n\n634\n00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,830\nthey're sitting at a table having\ndinner to be tap, tapping away.\n\n635\n00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,990\nThan they are to talk to each\nother face to face, you know, so\n\n636\n00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,920\nit's like they've forming\nrelationship with that device.\n\n637\n00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,000\nWhich, you know, I can exploit.\n\n638\n00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,260\nI can definitely exploit that,\nexploit that relationship and\n\n639\n00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,000\nuse it to my advantage.\n\n640\n00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,990\n>> Right.\nYou start talking,\n\n641\n00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,050\nstart taking some of those other\ntechniques and mixing it in there.\n\n642\n00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:18,690\nName dropping and emails,\nand things like that.\n\n643\n00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,750\nForging headers.\n\n644\n00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:24,770\nWe know social media, I mean it's\neasy to create additional accounts.\n\n645\n00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:28,910\nAnd you make one that's similar to or\nis the same as somebody's name.\n\n646\n00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,300\nOr you can get somebody to\nget you as a friend, and\n\n647\n00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,790\nthen you get to see what their friends,\ntheir friends have.\n\n648\n00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,940\nJust a lot of ways we can\nstart getting in there and\n\n649\n00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,590\nstart getting the information that\nmight not otherwise be available to me.\n\n650\n00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,540\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n651\n00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:49,540\nAnd now kinda to explore those\ncouple little, those two categories.\n\n652\n00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,790\nIf you have the face-to-face one.\n\n653\n00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,640\nThe traditional method of\nsocial engineering works.\n\n654\n00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,712\nIt works quite well in the right hands.\n\n655\n00:30:58,712 --> 00:31:02,930\nYou know again, we were talking\nabout in our earlier segment.\n\n656\n00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,950\nWe were talking about,\nyou know, the way you dress,\n\n657\n00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,565\nthe way you talk, things like that.\n\n658\n00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,330\nBut it's even more than that.\n\n659\n00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,700\nYou can dress and, and act a certain way.\n\n660\n00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,090\nBut if you don't really\nbelieve in your cover.\n\n661\n00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:22,420\nAnd can sell it, then, it's going to,\nit's [INAUDIBLE] turn out well for you.\n\n662\n00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:22,970\n>> Right.\n\n663\n00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,580\nThat's that confidence aspect, which I\nthink, you know, would be my big weakness,\n\n664\n00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,930\nis I would, I'd get all nervous and\nhave trouble.\n\n665\n00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,880\nYou know, I'd, like I said,\nI'd be sweating bullets.\n\n666\n00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,020\nBut, you got to have that\nconfidence otherwise.\n\n667\n00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,790\nYou almost have to be an actor, don't you?\n\n668\n00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,450\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n669\n00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,240\n>> I mean, really.\n\n670\n00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,980\n>> It's like your studying for a part and\nyou're learning names, terminology,\n\n671\n00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,820\nthings like that.\n\n672\n00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,700\nHow to dress, how to walk, how to talk.\n\n673\n00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,080\nAnd you just gotta out there and do it.\n\n674\n00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,460\nGive that performance of your life and\nreap the rewards of social engineering.\n\n675\n00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,915\n>> Absolutely.\n\n676\n00:31:50,915 --> 00:31:53,765\nSee, I am an exceptionally good liar, so.\n\n677\n00:31:53,765 --> 00:31:55,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've got no problem with that.\n\n678\n00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,174\nMade you guys believe I know\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n679\n00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:58,674\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n680\n00:31:58,674 --> 00:32:01,008\n[LAUGH] Bam!.\n\n681\n00:32:01,008 --> 00:32:01,735\n>> And he's the captain\n\n682\n00:32:01,735 --> 00:32:03,736\nof the USS Enterprise, so, you know?\n>> Yes.\n\n683\n00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:04,421\nYes, I am the captain.\n\n684\n00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:07,196\n>> [LAUGH] [LAUGH]\n\n685\n00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:09,913\n>> So, but it's fascinating, yeah,\n\n686\n00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:15,200\nwhen you, that if you use\nthe face-to-face techniques.\n\n687\n00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,410\nThere's, and there's plenty of ways\nto pursue that, like you said,\n\n688\n00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:19,580\nthe moral obligation.\n\n689\n00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,150\nThe, you know, you could actually consider\neven, you know, bullying someone.\n\n690\n00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,540\nYou know,\nbrow-beating them into doing something.\n\n691\n00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,880\nYou know, on your behalf.\n\n692\n00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,410\nKnowing jargon.\n\n693\n00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:31,120\nYou know, making someone, you know,\nempathizing with the person.\n\n694\n00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,900\nSometimes that's enough it's like I\nfeel your, you know, I feel your pain.\n\n695\n00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,335\nThat's enough to get them to open up.\n\n696\n00:32:36,335 --> 00:32:37,260\n>> Mm-mm.\n\n697\n00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,662\n>> You know, and some, and\nyou know, there's then of course,\n\n698\n00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:44,100\nyou know, name dropping,\nyou know like say, you know, helps.\n\n699\n00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,390\nBut you also gonna need to think about\nthose behaviors too from the defensive\n\n700\n00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,240\nside just FYI.\n\n701\n00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,090\nYou know look to see if something's is,\n\n702\n00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:56,350\njust because someone is doing\nname dropping and someone.\n\n703\n00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,000\nOne is making it feel like hey\nit's the right thing to do.\n\n704\n00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,670\nYou know if you don't,\nif it's not normal procedure or\n\n705\n00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:07,210\nit's not the or, it's not something\nthat's considered to be, you know,\n\n706\n00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,150\nsomething you should do, you know everyday\nthen you should be challenging it.\n\n707\n00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,130\n>> Right.\n>> You know don't,\n\n708\n00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,000\nI mean there's the people\nsometimes make informal requests.\n\n709\n00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,700\nIt's like hey can we keep\nthis between you and I.\n\n710\n00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,470\nMm.\n>> You know, that sometimes,\n\n711\n00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:21,050\nthat sometimes works.\n\n712\n00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,780\nYou know, but, you think about those types\nof things, that's what you train your\n\n713\n00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,740\nemployees on is that someone\ncould make an informal request.\n\n714\n00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,810\nIf you question them, they kind of get,\nyou know, kind of, you know,\n\n715\n00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,965\nhesitate in what they're doing.\n\n716\n00:33:31,965 --> 00:33:34,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, things like that.\n\n717\n00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,390\n>> Those can be indicators that,\nyeah there are something fishy going on.\n\n718\n00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:40,580\n>> Right.\n>> Definitely something fishy going on.\n\n719\n00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,230\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nAgain,\n\n720\n00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,960\nit really does come down to\nteaching our users about this.\n\n721\n00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,200\nAnd it's a constant thing, right.\n\n722\n00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,920\nI know myself somebody in that chat\nroom talking about turn over rates and\n\n723\n00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,780\nthat's always an issue.\n\n724\n00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,700\nYou get people trained up and\nthen they leave and\n\n725\n00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,490\nwe're always going to\nhave to deal with that.\n\n726\n00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:58,220\nBut even for places where the turnover\nrate is not that high, you know,\n\n727\n00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,610\nit's just like everything we do.\n\n728\n00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:01,380\nIf we don't use it, we lose it, right?\n\n729\n00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,590\nSo It's got to be a constant reminder.\n\n730\n00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,570\nWhether that's, semi-annually or\nquarterly or whatever.\n\n731\n00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:10,490\nYou have meetings, you make pizza parties,\nyou make it fun, you try to\n\n732\n00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,090\nmake it entertaining and to teach your\nusers about social engineering and\n\n733\n00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:18,290\nmaking sure that they understand that hey,\nit's okay to question somebody.\n\n734\n00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,110\nThere's different ways to do it.\n\n735\n00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,480\nAnd you don't walk up to somebody and\nsay who the heck are you,\n\n736\n00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,100\nwhat are you doing here.\n\n737\n00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,000\nYou know?\n\n738\n00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,380\nHey, may I help you find something?\n\n739\n00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,280\nWho are you looking for?\n\n740\n00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,820\nYou know, so there's ways you can go\nabout it and teach your users to,\n\n741\n00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,600\nto do it where they can help you keep your\nnetwork secure, at the same time what if\n\n742\n00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,670\nthere was a CEO from another area of\nthe country that you didn't recognize.\n\n743\n00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,520\nWe'd had to make a complete ares\nout of yourself and, you know,\n\n744\n00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:43,130\nsay anything stupid,\nyou can handle it the proper way,\n\n745\n00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,920\nand that's the big thing about\npeople wanting to help and stuff,\n\n746\n00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,990\nis they're afraid they're\ngoing to get in trouble too.\n\n747\n00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:51,720\nYou know, I don't wan the repercussions\nof telling the boss that you didn't go\n\n748\n00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,200\nthrough proper channels, I can't\ninstall that software on your laptop.\n\n749\n00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,140\nWell I'm the one that signs your check.\n\n750\n00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,650\nYeah well, sorry.\n\n751\n00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,978\nThat's not the proper channel.\n\n752\n00:34:58,978 --> 00:35:00,780\nSo [COUGH] you know, again,\n\n753\n00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,400\neducating users is a big key to helping\nprevent some of the social engineering.\n\n754\n00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,090\nYeah, you know absolutely.\n\n755\n00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,580\nIt's being aware of these behaviors and\nbeing able to stop them.\n\n756\n00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,370\nYou know, people do like to,\npeople do like to name drop.\n\n757\n00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,510\nThat's just a normal thing, and we've\nall been a victim of it and we may, and\n\n758\n00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,760\nwe may have, done that ourselves you know,\nit's like all I know so and\n\n759\n00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:32,605\nso you know that you know it's and hoping\nthat will get us cuz you know somewhere.\n\n760\n00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:35,880\n>> Yeah, I, fell victim to it all\nthe time I mean it's nothing serious but\n\n761\n00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,750\nlike I'll go home at night after I've\ntaught a class, one of those Microsoft\n\n762\n00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:40,110\nofficial classes and\n>> And\n\n763\n00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,560\nI'm like, did I really need\nto tell everybody about that?\n\n764\n00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,460\nYou know, they don't need to know\nmy personal history, you know, and\n\n765\n00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,180\nthings like that and, but people ask you\nquestion you just want to respond and\n\n766\n00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,760\ncommunicate and kind of, you know,\ndevelop that, that relationship.\n\n767\n00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,490\nSo, even people that are trained\nsometimes can, you know, slip up.\n\n768\n00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,490\n>> Yeah.\nSocial Networking has really made the,\n\n769\n00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:03,810\nhas really made this easier.\n\n770\n00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:07,580\n>> Because you can get little nuggets of\ninformation about someone and then talk to\n\n771\n00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:13,770\nthem and you can use those sayings to kind\nof build familiarity with that person.\n\n772\n00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,940\nI also look at, you know,\njust myself, when I look at social,\n\n773\n00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,930\nwhen I look at Social Networking and all\nthese social media type stuff, I look at\n\n774\n00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,850\nit as kind of an example of the fact that\nit's easier to get information out of,\n\n775\n00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,940\ninformation out of people face to face or\ntechnology than it.\n\n776\n00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,320\n>> Mm.\n>> Ever was in the past.\n\n777\n00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,760\nCuz people love, well,\nthey always have, but\n\n778\n00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,910\nnow we've put on the platform,\nthey love talking about themselves.\n\n779\n00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,639\n[LAUGH] You know they just,\nall they, all they gotta do is just,\n\n780\n00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,695\nall you gotta do is just get something\nto get that conversation going.\n\n781\n00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:43,180\n>> Mm-hmm.\n>> And people just are,\n\n782\n00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,610\nwanna be put on that stage.\n\n783\n00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,835\nAnd have people kinda, you know, oh,\nyou know, kinda wow, really, you did that?\n\n784\n00:36:49,835 --> 00:36:55,100\nAnd, it's knowing that's\nthe way things have\n\n785\n00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,260\ngone and,\nit's amazing to kinda watch it in action.\n\n786\n00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:06,040\nSomething I was watching, something I\nremember seeing, you know some time ago.\n\n787\n00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,850\nWas, you know, there in Japan in the 80's\nthere was some really good examples of\n\n788\n00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,760\ndoing excellent social engineering.\n\n789\n00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,840\nThere was a cultural thing.\n\n790\n00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,130\nAs they said people here from the U.S.\nwould go over to, would go over to Japan,\n\n791\n00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:22,890\nthese businessman would go over\nto set up some sort of, you know,\n\n792\n00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,080\npartnership with the Japanese company.\n\n793\n00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,920\nAnd one of the tactics the Japanese\nused is that, you know,\n\n794\n00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,490\nyou get this American businessman coming\nin and sitting down at the table and\n\n795\n00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,920\nthe Japanese executives are sitting there\nwith like a tea service or something.\n\n796\n00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200\nAnd they would just serve tea and\n\n797\n00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,270\nwouldn't talk about business,\nand that's the way they.\n\n798\n00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:47,150\n>> And that's just kind of\nthe way they start things out.\n\n799\n00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,350\nMeanwhile, on the other side, in the West,\nyou know, in America, you know,\n\n800\n00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:55,400\njust to single that out, we like to kind\nof, we kinda like to come in and say,\n\n801\n00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,480\nlet's get down to business.\n\n802\n00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,380\nThat's kind of the way things are doing.\n\n803\n00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,860\nAnd, what happens there is that that\nmentality of hey, we're going to sit here\n\n804\n00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,010\nsipping tea while you're going to sit\nthere and say, hey, let's get down to\n\n805\n00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:08,370\nbusiness, and you start talking about\nwhat your plans are and stuff like that\n\n806\n00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:12,080\nyou're revealing your hand to them\nwithout them giving you any information.\n\n807\n00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,240\nYou know, so you just quietly\nsocially engineered that person and\n\n808\n00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,630\nthey're revealing stuff to you.\n\n809\n00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,730\nAnd we've also always seen it in\nthe work places too, where if you\n\n810\n00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,590\nact in an inferior position, someone\njust loves lording it all over you.\n\n811\n00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,398\nThey just do, I mean, I can't tell you how\nmany times you know, I've, you know I've,\n\n812\n00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:40,570\nyou know, II've gone through and acted\nlike I didn't really know anything about,\n\n813\n00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,945\nyou know, about, you know,\ntechnology or whatever.\n\n814\n00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:44,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know,\n\n815\n00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,810\nI had someone show me how\nto use a computer once.\n\n816\n00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,407\nIt was only-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n817\n00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,450\n>> It was only about a year ago, too.\n\n818\n00:38:47,450 -->

things like that.\n\n986\n00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,782\nThe thing is if they didn't\nwork they wouldn't be around.\n\n987\n00:45:56,782 --> 00:46:00,470\nAll right, you wouldn't see this stuff,\nseveral people that probably\n\n988\n00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:04,055\nwould've responded to that text,\nso if I throw it out enough.\n\n989\n00:46:04,055 --> 00:46:07,125\nIf I cast a wide enough net,\nI might be able to catch me a fish.\n\n990\n00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,905\n>> Or I got an email from once,\n>> [COUGH]\n\n991\n00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:11,145\n>> That the head of the

from Bank E Moon,\nyou know from the UN.\n\n995\n00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,312\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was like, really?\n\n996\n00:46:20,942 --> 00:46:21,972\n>> Guess you opened that right up.\n\n997\n00:46:21,972 --> 00:46:24,922\n>> I was like, oh, well,\nyeah, we go way back.\n\n998\n00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:26,687\nYou know, when I was growing up in Korea.\n\n999\n00:46:26,687 --> 00:46:29,291\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, we like hung out.\n\n1000\n00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:32,189\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1001\n00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,612\n>> It's like, random.\n\n1002\n00:46:34,612 --> 00:46:37,692\nYeah, so, it was pretty,\nit was pretty funny when I saw it.\n\n1003\n00:46:37,692 --> 00:46:40,442\nI was going through my trash folders like\nto see if anything got caught in there,\n\n1004\n00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:44,030\nmy filters and all that,\nthank you, what the, what?\n\n1005\n00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:45,040\nReally?\n\n1006\n00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,850\n[LAUGH] It was pretty funny to see.\n\n1007\n00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:53,178\nI actually kept it for a while,\nI just want to show people like,\n\n1008\n00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:54,740\ndude I'm important.\n\n1009\n00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:55,490\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n1010\n00:46:55,490 --> 00:47:00,065\n>> He asked me to solve these problems, so\n\n1011\n00:47:00,065 --> 00:47:00,960\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1012\n00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:04,030\njust too easy to get information out of-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1013\n00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,170\n>> people.\nYou know, you send them emails about hey,\n\n1014\n00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:09,920\nwe're upgrading that database application,\nwe need to make sure that you've got\n\n1015\n00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,280\naccess, so we're gonna need\nyour password or something.\n\n1016\n00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,900\nGet them to give that out.\n\n1017\n00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,760\nHeck, writing scripts to put\nfake dialog boxes on computers.\n\n1018\n00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,150\nPop up a log on and people aren't going to\nthink twice about why in the heck is my\n\n1019\n00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,700\nsystem asking me to authenticate again?\n\n1020\n00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,560\nAnd they type something in and the box\ngoes away and they think everything is\n\n1021\n00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:34,230\nfine not realizing it was just a fake box,\nyeah, too easy to do, to easy to do.\n\n1022\n00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,805\n>> Yeah.\nPeople are way too trusting with\n\n1023\n00:47:36,805 --> 00:47:38,600\ntechnology.\n\n1024\n00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,300\nI'd say to a certain degree\nthey're more trusting and\n\n1025\n00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,610\nmore connected to technology than they\nare, you know, really anything else.\n\n1026\n00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:45,700\n>> Right.\n>> You know, nowadays.\n\n1027\n00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,990\nIt just, it, it seems,\nit just seems that way.\n\n1028\n00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:51,980\nSo they have that very personal,\nintimate relationship with it, you know.\n\n1029\n00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,320\nYou, we all know people who\nare maybe guilty of it,\n\n1030\n00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,180\nof have, of, of, of you know, basically\neven having our phone in the bed with us.\n\n1031\n00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:01,385\nYou know, you know it's just.\n\n1032\n00:48:01,385 --> 00:48:03,284\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's people that do that.\n\n1033\n00:48:03,284 --> 00:48:04,562\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like laying there.\n\n1034\n00:48:04,562 --> 00:48:05,211\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know.\n\n1035\n00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:07,928\nSo that they're just sorta sleeping\nthere on the, sleeping on their bed, and\n\n1036\n00:48:07,928 --> 00:48:09,089\ntheir cell phone is right there.\n\n1037\n00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:11,829\nIt's like, what, why are you doing that?\n\n1038\n00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:12,421\nYeah.\n\n1039\n00:48:12,421 --> 00:48:13,791\n>> Somebody might text me\nin the middle of the night.\n\n1040\n00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,347\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you gotta respond.\n\n1041\n00:48:15,347 --> 00:48:18,364\nOr somebody might post something\non Facebook that I like, you know.\n\n1042\n00:48:18,364 --> 00:48:19,125\n>> Yeah, I got updates.\n\n1043\n00:48:19,125 --> 00:48:20,030\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1044\n00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,040\n>> And it's just, you know,\n\n1045\n00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,275\npeople will do that sort of thing.\n\n1046\n00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:31,690\nAnd since they have that intimate\nrelationship with technology,\n\n1047\n00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,690\nyou know, there's all sorts of ways you\ncan manipulate someone through that.\n\n1048\n00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:39,370\nA lot of them are just variations\nof stuff we see face to face.\n\n1049\n00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,170\nBut it might be a lot\neasier to do it there.\n\n1050\n00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:46,490\n>> You know, through messaging,\nthrough instant messaging,\n\n1051\n00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:48,430\nthrough text messaging,\nthrough phone calls.\n\n1052\n00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,850\nYou know, through all sorts of things.\n\n1053\n00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,160\nThey do indeed work.\n\n1054\n00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,412\nAnd I even add something else onto it.\n\n1055\n00:48:56,412 --> 00:49:00,370\nPeople just, you know, people look at when\nthey're interacting with technology, oh,\n\n1056\n00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:01,950\nthe technology's safe.\n\n1057\n00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:03,350\nThe technology isn't safe.\n\n1058\n00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:07,370\nYou know, that's just kind of my\nrule is that technology is not safe.\n\n1059\n00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,010\nIt has to prove it.\n\n1060\n00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,090\nYou know, I don't just trust you.\n\n1061\n00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,710\nYou have to earn that trust.\n\n1062\n00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,610\nSo, you know, and then so,\nthat's a problem.\n\n1063\n00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:18,520\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1064\n00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,660\nOne of our users out there on\nthe chatroom, I think it was Fabian here,\n\n1065\n00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,860\nwhat about turning on a WiFi hotspot and\nleaving it open for people to connect to?\n\n1066\n00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,040\nAbsolutely, right?\n\n1067\n00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,800\nI mean, that's.\n>> That's social engineering, yeah.\n\n1068\n00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,620\n>> That's another form\nof social engineering.\n\n1069\n00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:32,500\nAnd many people are just gonna\nconnect to the strongest signal.\n\n1070\n00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:37,300\nOr you're given an SSID, that's like,\nStarbucks2, you know or whatever.\n\n1071\n00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,150\nSo they think it's just like an alternate\nnetwork that the business is running,\n\n1072\n00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:42,300\nand they have no problems\nconnecting to it.\n\n1073\n00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:45,750\nAnd too many people will do their\nbanking and things like that,\n\n1074\n00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,880\nover an open connection.\n\n1075\n00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,310\nTyping in passwords that aren't encrypted,\nthings like that.\n\n1076\n00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:53,310\nSo, for sure that's a valid technique.\n\n1077\n00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,820\n>> Which kinda drives me\ncrazy with some of these, and\n\n1078\n00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,902\nI know it's relatively secure,\nbut a lot of the.\n\n1079\n00:49:58,902 --> 00:50:04,080\nI know Cox is doing it in my area,\nwhere they're now selling the routers with\n\n1080\n00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,975\nthe cable modem, with a built-in wi-fi,\nwith a built-in wi-fi router in there.\n\n1081\n00:50:07,975 --> 00:50:10,670\n[COUGH] And so\nwhat they're doing is you're setting up,\n\n1082\n00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:11,840\nyou're basically creating two.\n\n1083\n00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,770\nYou've got your personal network, and\n\n1084\n00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,560\nthen you've got a public one\nthat you can't turn off because\n\n1085\n00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,625\nCox is trying to build up this open wifi\nor whatever around the neighborhoods.\n\n1086\n00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:24,750\nAnd that means somebody's at my box.\n\n1087\n00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,272\nNow they can't, hopefully they can't\nget over to my information, but\n\n1088\n00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:30,540\nthey're a lot closer\nthan they were before.\n\n1089\n00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:31,650\n>> Oh yeah, oh yeah.\n\n1090\n00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,880\nIt's these little things\nthat are happening.\n\n1091\n00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,740\nJust, you know, what can you say?\n\n1092\n00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,200\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, really.\n\n1093\n00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:42,380\n>> Especially, you know, with, like you\nwere saying with the phones and stuff.\n\n1094\n00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,600\nNowadays and I know, I think the last\ntime I went traveling, you know,\n\n1095\n00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,770\nyou pop open your phone, and\nyou see like John's hot spot, you know.\n\n1096\n00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,401\nAnd that's just some person with\ntheir phone or their iPad or\n\n1097\n00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:54,270\nsomething that's doing that very thing.\n\n1098\n00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,485\nAnd do they know how to secure them?\n\n1099\n00:50:56,485 --> 00:50:57,155\nKeep them safe.\n\n1100\n00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:58,679\nThis guy didn't.\n\n1101\n00:50:58,679 --> 00:50:59,858\nI'm just kidding.\n\n1102\n00:50:59,858 --> 00:51:03,620\n[LAUGH]\n>> Maybe.\n\n1103\n00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:05,230\nBut he learned his lesson.\n\n1104\n00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,660\nThat's the important thing.\n\n1105\n00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:09,720\n>> All right.\nWell, I'll tell you what, ladies and\n\n1106\n00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,900\ngentleman, this is probably a good\npoint for us to take our break.\n\n1107\n00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,477\nSo we're gonna stop,\nand when we come back,\n\n1108\n00:51:14,477 --> 00:51:16,479\nwe're gonna continue on with\nmore social engineering.\n\n1109\n00:51:16,479 --> 00:51:18,227\nSo stay tuned.\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1110\n00:51:18,227 --> 00:51:25,907\n[MUSIC]\n\n1111\n00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:28,050\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1112\n00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:30,420\nContinuing on with our social engineering.\n\n1113\n00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,412\nWe're gonna take a look at,\n\n1114\n00:51:31,412 --> 00:51:36,220\nI guess, how can we protect ourselves\nmaybe from social engineering?\n\n1115\n00:51:37,265 --> 00:51:40,370\n>> Yeah, when we're talking\nabout social engineering,\n\n1116\n00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:45,515\nwe've already covered some of the ways\nsocial engineering can take place.\n\n1117\n00:51:45,515 --> 00:51:51,200\nAnd social engineering can be a very\nbad and nasty thing if it hits you.\n\n1118\n00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,470\nYou know, so, we've learned\nabout what can be done with it.\n\n1119\n00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:59,220\nBut, you know, what can you do to protect\nyourself and your employees, or the people\n\n1120\n00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:05,870\nyou're entrusted with, training to make\nsure that they don't become victims.\n\n1121\n00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:11,090\nAnd because, the reality of it is this\nis a rising area, social engineering,\n\n1122\n00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:15,310\nthat human element is,\nlike I said before, is a soft target.\n\n1123\n00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:19,920\nThe bad guys know that, so this is\nsomething that you have to actually test.\n\n1124\n00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,330\nI mean things like, you know,\n\n1125\n00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:25,920\none of the ones that we haven't really\nspent too much time on, identity theft.\n\n1126\n00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:26,546\n>> Oh yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n1127\n00:52:26,546 --> 00:52:28,488\n>> Identity theft is a really nasty one\n\n1128\n00:52:28,488 --> 00:52:31,020\nthat's an outgrowth of social engineering.\n\n1129\n00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,420\nSomeone can talk to you and get enough\nabout you that they could go and\n\n1130\n00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:38,480\nclone your identity, and then become you.\n\n1131\n00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,150\nAnd now they can do other things with it.\n\n1132\n00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,300\nAnd so.\n\n1133\n00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,390\n>> That's a nasty one, that social,\nit's a form of social engineering,\n\n1134\n00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,160\nthat identity theft.\n\n1135\n00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,560\nAnd I think one of the things that I find,\nand I don't know about you,\n\n1136\n00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,640\nis that, I think people are under\nthe misconception that it's all online.\n\n1137\n00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,020\nYou know, that if I go and I shop online,\nmy identification gets stolen, and\n\n1138\n00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,500\nto me it's really,\nit's the opposite, right?\n\n1139\n00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,820\nAnd I mean, if I have secure\nconnection with Newegg, and\n\n1140\n00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:05,170\nI'm punching in my credit card number,\nnobody's gonna get that information,\n\n1141\n00:53:05,170 --> 00:53:06,570\nthey'd have to compromise Newegg.\n\n1142\n00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:09,850\nI'd have to choose to store my\ncredit card on their site, or\n\n1143\n00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:13,030\nsomething like that, and then they\nmight able to compromise me that way,\n\n1144\n00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:15,790\nwhere it's more likely to\noccur is at the restaurant.\n\n1145\n00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:17,590\nWhere I give that guy my credit card, and\n\n1146\n00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:20,790\nhe walks to the back to scan\nmy card to pay for my lunch.\n\n1147\n00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:21,770\nHe's got my actual card.\n\n1148\n00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,120\nHe can write down the numbers.\n\n1149\n00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,440\nHe can flip it over and write down\nthe three-digit code on the back of it.\n\n1150\n00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,600\nThat's where you're gonna get\nthat kind of information stolen.\n\n1151\n00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,640\nBut people aren't aware of that, so\n\n1152\n00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,950\nthey're much more casual with\nit in the physical world.\n\n1153\n00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,500\nAnd then, they think, oh gosh, I'm not\ngonna do any online banking, I'm not gonna\n\n1154\n00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,120\nbuy things online, because that's\nwhere my identity's gonna get stolen.\n\n1155\n00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,560\n>> Yeah, absolutely,\nin fact you mentioned a good one.\n\n1156\n00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,570\nWith having, with letting your\ncredit card out of your control,\n\n1157\n00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:53,010\nwhat's really kinda scary about that, it's\nsomething for all of you to think about.\n\n1158\n00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:57,108\nIs it doesn't have to be him to the back\nroom, they can actually, you know,\n\n1159\n00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,631\nwhen a waiter takes you at a restaurant,\ntakes your credit card,\n\n1160\n00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:05,178\nwhen he's got that jacket that he takes it\nfrom, their scanner's small enough that\n\n1161\n00:54:05,178 --> 00:54:09,640\nhe could sit there and hold the thing and\nclone it right while he's talking to you.\n\n1162\n00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:14,370\nYou know, so, it's really\nsomething to kind of keep in mind.\n\n1163\n00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's\n\n1164\n00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:17,430\nincredibly easy with\nthe devices that we have.\n\n1165\n00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:18,180\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1166\n00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:20,860\nAbsolutely.\nAnd then once they've got that identity or\n\n1167\n00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,960\nthat first part of it,\nthey can continue to social engineer.\n\n1168\n00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,660\nOr then they might go into the electronic\nside of things and try to do\n\n1169\n00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,720\nfootprinting on you and things like\nthat to get more information about you.\n\n1170\n00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,700\nAnd apply for a loan or another credit\ncard that gets mailed to their house,\n\n1171\n00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,690\nyou know, or something like that.\n\n1172\n00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,700\nSo, you know, that typically it\ndoes start in an offline and\n\n1173\n00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:40,150\nagain it comes back to educating\npeople on not letting your\n\n1174\n00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,650\ncredit card out of your sight if you can\nhelp it, you know, and things like that.\n\n1175\n00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:44,705\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n1176\n00:54:44,705 --> 00:54:48,070\nIt's, you know, one of,\n\n1177\n00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:52,630\nthere used to be some other ways to do\nidentity theft, and they're not as easy.\n\n1178\n00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:57,480\nNowadays it's gonna be something like\nthis, someone's gonna grab a credit\n\n1179\n00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:02,010\ncard or they're gonna try to take your\nidentity through some other mechanism.\n\n1180\n00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:06,040\nIt used to be things like you could get a\ndriver's license issued to you fair, there\n\n1181\n00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:10,570\nwere some ways to get driver's licenses\nissued to you in someone else's name.\n\n1182\n00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:13,480\nPretty easily if you knew\nhow to work the system.\n\n1183\n00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,930\n>> Right.\n>> You know.\n\n1184\n00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,760\nAn easy thing that is, that used to be.\n\n1185\n00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,350\nThe fact,\nthis is the example EC-Council uses,\n\n1186\n00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,939\nis where you just say you have moved.\n\n1187\n00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:29,630\nAnd you lost your ID in the move,\nyour driver's license in the move, so\n\n1188\n00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:35,500\nyou need a new one, and you didn't happen\nto change your address at the same time.\n\n1189\n00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:39,410\nSo what they would ask, they used to ask\nfor for proof, you know at least here in\n\n1190\n00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:43,700\nthe States, used to ask for\nproof is a copy of a utility bill,\n\n1191\n00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,032\nsomething like that, something to prove\nthat you are who you say you are.\n\n1192\n00:55:47,032 --> 00:55:48,500\nAnd, so, all you gotta do is do\n\n1193\n00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,600\nsome dumpster diving-\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n1194\n00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,423\n>> So we're back at that, and\nshow those utility bills.\n\n1195\n00:55:53,423 --> 00:55:57,946\nAnd, so once they're confident with that,\nyou fill the change of address,\n\n1196\n00:55:57,946 --> 00:56:01,286\nyou take your picture, and\nthen sometime later you get,\n\n1197\n00:56:01,286 --> 00:56:04,158\nyou get a license with that,\nwith your picture.\n\n1198\n00:56:04,158 --> 00:56:08,748\nWith the other person's information on it,\nwith an address that you specified.\n\n1199\n00:56:08,748 --> 00:56:13,510\nAnd so, once you have that you can\nhave some sort of mischief with it.\n\n1200\n00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:16,210\nReality is nowadays that\nisn't gonna be that easy.\n\n1201\n00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,720\nYou can't just go down to the DMV\nhere in the states and say oh,\n\n1202\n00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,510\nwell here's some utility bills.\n\n1203\n00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:21,430\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> You know,\n\n1204\n00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,739\nsince everything that happened,\non September 11th and\n\n1205\n00:56:24,739 --> 00:56:28,181\nthe counter-terrorism bills and\nall that, you try that and\n\n1206\n00:56:28,181 --> 00:56:31,970\nyou're probably gonna run\nafoul of a lot of stuff.\n\n1207\n00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:34,100\nAnd once they find out what you're doing,\n\n1208\n00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,750\nthey could detain you once they\nfind out what you're doing.\n\n1209\n00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:39,600\nThere could be a lot of heck to pay.\n\n1210\n00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,689\n>> Right.\n>> On that so\n\n1211\n00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:43,650\nit's not advisable to try that.\n\n1212\n00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,010\nBut, there's still\nplenty of other methods.\n\n1213\n00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:50,640\nIt could be as simple as\ncloning a student ID.\n\n1214\n00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,675\nDuplicating that can work,\ncan probably get you some traction.\n\n1215\n00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:59,498\nThere's other forms of ID you\ncould actually use that could get\n\n1216\n00:56:59,498 --> 00:57:01,520\nyou some traction.\n\n1217\n00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,120\nSo, just something to think about.\n\n1218\n00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,540\nIf you're penetrating a company,\nit could be as simple as just\n\n1219\n00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:12,220\ncreating a very realistic looking ID for\nthe company.\n\n1220\n00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,490\nAnd even if there are FID cards or\nsomething like that, that you have to\n\n1221\n00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:19,240\nswipe in front of a sensor, all you\ngotta do is make it look like that.\n\n1222\n00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,890\nBecause if it doesn't work, all you have\nto do is just if there's security guard\n\n1223\n00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:26,520\nnearby, and lot of places there are, you\ncan say hey, mine isn't working, and look.\n\n1224\n00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,120\nThey'll look at it and\ngo, yeah, it looks legit.\n\n1225\n00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,690\nYou say yeah, I accidentally put it\nthrough the washer with my jeans or\n\n1226\n00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:33,410\nsomething like that.\n\n1227\n00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:34,850\nThey'll be like yeah, I've been there.\n\n1228\n00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:35,708\nI hear you.\n\n1229\n00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:38,440\n>> Right.\n>> And you're in.\n\n1230\n00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,035\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, I have done that myself for\n\n1231\n00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:42,660\npenetration tests.\n\n1232\n00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,840\n>> You're doing the social engineering,\nyou create that badge, and\n\n1233\n00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:46,430\nthen you're social engineering the guard.\n\n1234\n00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,970\nYou're building that trust with him.\n\n1235\n00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,983\nYeah, I washed it, and he's got that\nsimilar experience so he feels for you.\n\n1236\n00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:54,720\nAnd again,\ntaking advantage of that human nature.\n\n1237\n00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,951\n>> Yeah, and you know, absolutely,\n\n1238\n00:57:55,951 --> 00:57:57,665\nthey feel it's the right\nthing to do to help you.\n\n1239\n00:57:57,665 --> 00:58:02,015\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And I'll tell you, that's a factor in\n\n1240\n00:58:02,015 --> 00:58:06,745\nthat story is did they\neven really check the ID?\n\n1241\n00:58:06,745 --> 00:58:07,585\n>> Right.\n\n1242\n00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:14,550\n>> I know of one pen test where they\nhad an ID, the people that were doing\n\n1243\n00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:21,608\nthis made a very realistic looking ID and\nthey waved it at the security guard.\n\n1244\n00:58:21,608 --> 00:58:25,020\nThe security guard just kind of said,\nwaved them by and says, okay,\n\n1245\n00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,280\nI see it, and waved them by.\n\n1246\n00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,760\nThey were able to drive\ninto the place of business.\n\n1247\n00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:36,060\nAnd they were able to get all\nthe way up to the CEO's office\n\n1248\n00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:40,890\nbefore someone was able to say, hey,\nyou're not supposed to be here.\n\n1249\n00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:45,590\nAnd, at that point, they said, doesn't\nmatter, I can see the guy from right here,\n\n1250\n00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,730\nI could have put a bullet in his head.\n\n1251\n00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:50,282\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> It doesn't matter that you got me here.\n\n1252\n00:58:50,282 --> 00:58:54,641\nAnd the footnote to this story is that\nthat license, the picture that they had on\n\n1253\n00:58:54,641 --> 00:58:59,350\nit, or the badge, the picture they\nhad on it was of Cookie Monster.\n\n1254\n00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:00,588\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No one looked at it.\n\n1255\n00:59:00,588 --> 00:59:05,330\nSo they knew that these\npeople would do it.\n\n1256\n00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:06,465\nIt was right there.\n\n1257\n00:59:06,465 --> 00:59:09,551\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, that's mistake number one and\n\n1258\n00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,590\nit got through multiple guards that way.\n\n1259\n00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,225\n>> Wow.\n>> So, multiple people screwed up.\n\n1260\n00:59:14,225 --> 00:59:14,965\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1261\n00:59:14,965 --> 00:59:18,340\nYeah, that could be some RGE's,\nsome resume generating events, there.\n\n1262\n00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:23,480\n>> Yeah, that was a very,\nvery nasty event when you think about it.\n\n1263\n00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,140\nYou know, someone saying,\nhey, I stopped you.\n\n1264\n00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,160\nI can see him, I'm just like,\npow, gone, you know?\n\n1265\n00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,440\nIt doesn't matter if she got me.\n\n1266\n00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,800\nI have accomplished what\nI came in here to do.\n\n1267\n00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,630\nIf I was someone that wanted to\ncause harm to this individual.\n\n1268\n00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:38,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1269\n00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,540\n>> So, something to think about.\n\n1270\n00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,700\nIt's retraining those behaviors.\n\n1271\n00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n1272\n00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:47,810\n>> And one of the things I say with a\nsecurity badge is just kind of talk about\n\n1273\n00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,750\nthe prevention part of it and\n\n1274\n00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:54,890\nhow it fits into a story like this is,\nthe security badge is in a lot of places.\n\n1275\n00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,720\nThat's a security blanket.\n\n1276\n00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,340\nIt's not anything more than that.\n\n1277\n00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:02,220\nIt makes someone get that warm and fuzzy\nfeeling that oh yeah, there's a badge so\n\n1278\n01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,900\nI've got a badge, everyone else\nhas a badge, it must be okay.\n\n1279\n01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,020\nIt must be a very good system.\n\n1280\n01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,590\nBadges only work if people check them,\nand they check them the right way.\n\n1281\n01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:15,780\nI've been in numerous places where they\nhanded me a badge and it goes in the back\n\n1282\n01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,030\npocket because I'm doing something\nthat requires me crawling around or\n\n1283\n01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,670\ndoing whatever and\nI just don't want that in the way.\n\n1284\n01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,540\nSo I'll stick it in my pocket.\n\n1285\n01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:25,810\nNo one checks.\nIt's actually-\n\n1286\n01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:27,889\n>> They're supposed to ask you like hey,\n\n1287\n01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:29,090\nwhere's your badge?\n\n1288\n01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,700\n>> One place I remember someone\ndid ask me about my badge.\n\n1289\n01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,890\nThey said, where is your badge?\n\n1290\n01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,774\nAnd I said, well I've got one, here it is.\n\n1291\n01:00:36,774 --> 01:00:40,600\nAnd I go to pull it out, and it was funny\nthe way it worked, is that I was there for\n\n1292\n01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,680\ntwo weeks, this woman comes up to me and\nsays, do you have a badge?\n\n1293\n01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,060\nI said yeah, it's right here.\n\n1294\n01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,360\nHer response was, when I was reaching back\nto do it, I says yeah, it's right here.\n\n1295\n01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,465\nShe's like, okay good, and walks out.\n\n1296\n01:00:50,465 --> 01:00:51,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like,\n\n1297\n01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,360\nwhere's the followup on that story?\n\n1298\n01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,780\nYou know, follow up on that.\n\n1299\n01:00:54,780 --> 01:00:56,830\n>> So whether you had one, or\nou might not have even had one.\n\n1300\n01:00:56,830 --> 01:00:58,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> Just act like you're going to get it.\n\n1301\n01:00:58,470 --> 01:01:00,560\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you're just-\n\n1302\n01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,360\n>> Oh, you got one?\n\n1303\n01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,495\nYeah.\nOkay.\n\n1304\n01:01:02,495 --> 01:01:03,192\n>> Nice.\n\n1305\n01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:03,795\n[LAUGH].\n\n1306\n01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:05,630\n>> It's like, what?\n\n1307\n01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:12,144\nOkay, that's just not the right\nway to follow that up.\n\n1308\n01:01:12,144 --> 01:01:13,770\n>> No.\n>> And it's, you know, if companies are,\n\n1309\n01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,240\nif companies are gonna be issuing badges,\nfine.\n\n1310\n01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,215\nI'm not saying badges are a bad thing.\n\n1311\n01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:24,460\nBut, think about, in any company you've\nbeen to that issues badges, what they do.\n\n1312\n01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:28,430\nThey have this casual thing where badges\ncan go, people clip them on in all these\n\n1313\n01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:31,890\nweird places, their pocket,\ntheir belt, all sorts of things.\n\n1314\n01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:34,255\nIt might be on the lapel,\nit might be wherever.\n\n1315\n01:01:34,255 --> 01:01:36,770\nThere needs to be a standard\nplacement on the body for that.\n\n1316\n01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:39,320\nIf it's not there,\nI don't care if it's down here or\n\n1317\n01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,010\nhere, it has to be up\nabove a certain line.\n\n1318\n01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:45,848\nAnd if it's not there, you're gonna get\nstopped, period, don't care who you are.\n\n1319\n01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:47,030\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1320\n01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:51,160\nSo in the end there's a lot of different\nways we can go about preventing that\n\n1321\n01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,410\ndepending on what we're trying to prevent.\n\n1322\n01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:58,760\nTeaching our users about how to deal with\npeople they don't recognize in the office.\n\n1323\n01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,380\nTeaching our users about the badge.\n\n1324\n01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:03,290\nMaking sure that people know\nwhat it means to check a badge.\n\n1325\n01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:04,030\nAnd what to look for.\n\n1326\n01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:07,890\nThere's got to be something on there that\nthey can distinguish a fake from a real\n\n1327\n01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,890\nbadge, and so teach them that.\n\n1328\n01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,210\nTeach them how to look for that.\n\n1329\n01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:13,590\nGosh, what else?\n\n1330\n01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,320\nJust shredding information.\n\n1331\n01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,900\nWe mentioned the term\ndumpster diving again.\n\n1332\n01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,790\nI don't know, I saw in the chat room,\npeople talking about shredding, or\n\n1333\n01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:25,340\nmelting, or burning things like utility\nbills and credit card offers, and\n\n1334\n01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:25,890\nthings like that.\n\n1335\n01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,115\nAnd that's great in the home,\nand in the workplace as well.\n\n1336\n01:02:29,115 --> 01:02:29,952\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n1337\n01:02:29,952 --> 01:02:33,860\nWill typically have a secure dumpster\nthat everything gets put into and\n\n1338\n01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,550\nthat we know is gonna go get shredded and\nburned or something like that.\n\n1339\n01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,200\nYou'd be surprised what people throw away.\n\n1340\n01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,840\nSticky notes are the worst because\npeople will write things down,\n\n1341\n01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,080\nthey're on the phone with somebody, and so\n\n1342\n01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,510\nthey'll write that account number\ndown that they need to go check on.\n\n1343\n01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:48,510\nThey'll tape it to their monitor.\n\n1344\n01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,500\nThey finish that project,\n\n1345\n01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,590\nand they just crumple up that sticky note,\nthrow it in the garbage.\n\n1346\n01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,970\nNow think about it, it's not a secure\ndocument I've gotta go shred.\n\n1347\n01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:55,990\nIt's just a Post-It note.\n\n1348\n01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,590\nThose blotter calendar things,\n\n1349\n01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,490\nthose desk pads, what do you do\nwith those at the end of the year?\n\n1350\n01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:02,660\nYou throw them in the garbage.\n\n1351\n01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,900\nAnd if I flip back through there,\nI can see your appointments,\n\n1352\n01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:06,390\nand who you were meeting with, and\n\n1353\n01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:09,560\nthat's just more information that\nI can use to social engineer you.\n\n1354\n01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:11,610\nI'm guilty of that.\n\n1355\n01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:13,690\nYou've got nothing to write on, so\n\n1356\n01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,780\nyou just write it right there\non your calendar or something.\n\n1357\n01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,220\nYou start writing down contact info,\nor phone numbers, or\n\n1358\n01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,490\naccount numbers and things like that.\n\n1359\n01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:24,019\nSo, dumpster diving can be very\nfruitful as far as the bad guy goes.\n\n1360\n01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,410\nBut it's relatively easy to protect\nagainst if we just think about what it is\n\n1361\n01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:33,630\nthat we're throwing in the garbage,\nand the best way to dispose of it.\n\n1362\n01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:35,460\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1363\n01:03:35,460 --> 01:03:39,020\nYou have that, you have dumpster diving,\nyou have people throwing away stuff,\n\n1364\n01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:40,750\nor even writing down stuff.\n\n1365\n01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,310\nI see in here, the discussion groups,\n\n1366\n01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:47,160\nthings that shouldn't be,\nthere's just a host of bad behaviors.\n\n1367\n01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,620\nThe thing it comes down to is\nwhen you look at these behaviors,\n\n1368\n01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:52,600\nthese things that prevent identity theft,\n\n1369\n01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:58,860\nthat prevent them learning too much about\nyou, or learning stuff about the company.\n\n1370\n01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:00,580\nIt all comes down to education.\n\n1371\n01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:03,021\nThat's gonna be your defense.\n\n1372\n01:04:03,021 --> 01:04:09,248\nTeaching people how to recognize\nsigns of social engineering.\n\n1373\n01:04:09,248 --> 01:04:11,753\nAlso told them what information\ncan be shared and what's not.\n\n1374\n01:04:11,753 --> 01:04:16,690\nI've been to plenty of places where no one\nknows what they can or can't talk about.\n\n1375\n01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,890\nI had a place I worked at\nyears ago where I knew\n\n1376\n01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,700\nsomeone that had been there three months.\n\n1377\n01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:23,410\nHe came up to me, says,\n\n1378\n01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:28,630\nanyone given you the briefing on how to,\non ways to treat information?\n\n1379\n01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,090\nI said, no, and he says,\nno one gave it to me either.\n\n1380\n01:04:31,090 --> 01:04:36,130\nHe says, I just recommend that til you\nknow, you watch what you talk about.\n\n1381\n01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,550\nMy policy was even simpler than that.\n\n1382\n01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:41,920\nIf I don't know what I should be talking\nabout, I don't talk about it, period.\n\n1383\n01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,350\nAs far as you know, I go to an office and\nI come back until I find\n\n1384\n01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:52,240\nout the proper protocols and\nprocedures to follow, if any.\n\n1385\n01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,600\nBut that's something I would\neven impress upon employees now,\n\n1386\n01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,390\nand I do impress upon employees and\nclients now.\n\n1387\n01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:03,450\nIf you don't know what you can start,\nwhat you can talk about,\n\n1388\n01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:06,620\nand what you can't talk about, then,\njust don't talk about anything.\n\n1389\n01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,320\nThat's the safest way.\n\n1390\n01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,690\nI know you wanna share with family and\nall that, what you're doing at work, and\n\n1391\n01:05:12,690 --> 01:05:14,460\nall that type of stuff, but\n\n1392\n01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:17,820\nkeep your mouth shut until you\nknow what's safe and what's not.\n\n1393\n01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:23,650\nSo you don't land yourself in hot water,\nor get anyone else in hot water.\n\n1394\n01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:26,250\n>> Right.\n>> But you have to do the education thing.\n\n1395\n01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:31,480\nAnd also do not be afraid if you're\ngoing to be doing a pen test with this,\n\n1396\n01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:36,930\nalso encourages part of the remediation,\nregular checkups on this.\n\n1397\n01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,820\nHave someone that doesn't wear an ID.\n\n1398\n01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:42,460\nHave someone that asks questions and\nsee how people react to it.\n\n1399\n01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,370\nUse it as a training aid.\n\n1400\n01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,470\nThese things, when they're in your face\nlike that, and you're doing things like\n\n1401\n01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:53,200\nthat will get people,\nwill keep people thinking about it.\n\n1402\n01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,963\n>> Yeah.\nYou've really gotta keep it in the top\n\n1403\n01:05:54,963 --> 01:05:58,354\nof their mind, because it is another one\nof those things that if you don't use it,\n\n1404\n01:05:58,354 --> 01:05:59,153\nyou lose it.\n\n1405\n01:05:59,153 --> 01:06:02,422\nYou know, it sounded great,\nI was all pumped up at this meeting,\n\n1406\n01:06:02,422 --> 01:06:05,520\ngonna be secure,\nI'm gonna not write things down like that.\n\n1407\n01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:06,998\nI'm not gonna give away information.\n\n1408\n01:06:06,998 --> 01:06:08,738\nAfter a month I've forgotten all that,\n\n1409\n01:06:08,738 --> 01:06:11,660\nI just haven't thought about\nit since that meeting.\n\n1410\n01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:16,160\nSo you need that constant reminder and\nrepetition is the way humans learn.\n\n1411\n01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,630\nWe gotta do it over and\nover again to drill it into our heads.\n\n1412\n01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:21,330\nSo you've gotta keep on them and\n\n1413\n01:06:21,330 --> 01:06:24,560\ntesting them is the way to go\nbecause it gives you two things.\n\n1414\n01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:28,330\nOne is drilling it in and\nyou're testing them.\n\n1415\n01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:31,390\nYou can see where the weakness is lying,\nwhere we need improvement or whether or\n\n1416\n01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:32,590\nnot your training is working at all.\n\n1417\n01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:35,850\nI mean, you might find that\nyou've been doing training, but\n\n1418\n01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:37,060\nevidently it's not very effective.\n\n1419\n01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:39,190\nMaybe I need to try another method.\n\n1420\n01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:42,930\nThe PowerPoint presentation in a dark\nauditorium, which is not cutting it.\n\n1421\n01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:45,430\nSo maybe we go a different route,\nor something.\n\n1422\n01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:48,960\nSo by doing those tests,\nI can see how effective.\n\n1423\n01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,332\nJust like I would test a system on\nmy network, right, I'm gonna test my\n\n1424\n01:06:52,332 --> 01:06:56,456\nintrusion detection systems to make sure\nthat they're detecting attacks properly.\n\n1425\n01:06:56,456 --> 01:07:01,251\nI need to test my humans and\nsee if my training is actually improving,\n\n1426\n01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:03,248\nor working in that respect.\n\n1427\n01:07:03,248 --> 01:07:08,623\n>> Yeah, you have to test, you have to\ntry these things, you have to educate.\n\n1428\n01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:12,715\nYou just have to do a number of things\nto make sure the stuff is working cause\n\n1429\n01:07:12,715 --> 01:07:17,470\nreally technology is only gonna help\nyou so much, if at all, in this area.\n\n1430\n01:07:17,470 --> 01:07:20,370\nAnd in fact I can tell you\nthat doing certain tests,\n\n1431\n01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:24,790\nyou'll probably be shocked when you see\nthe results of some of these tests.\n\n1432\n01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,696\nI've been there,\nI've seen these results and\n\n1433\n01:07:27,696 --> 01:07:30,248\nsome of them just never cease to amaze me.\n\n1434\n01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:37,132\nYou know when they would, one of the ones\nthat the results will amaze you is,\n\n1435\n01:07:37,132 --> 01:07:41,123\ntried crafting a phishing email campaign.\n\n1436\n01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,012\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just try it at heck,\n\n1437\n01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:47,290\nat the company you're in right now if\nyou can get permission to do that.\n\n1438\n01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:47,800\nTry it.\n\n1439\n01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:52,500\nI saw one company try\na phishing email campaign and\n\n1440\n01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:56,080\nthey were supposed to be sending it\nto people inside the company and\n\n1441\n01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:59,810\nthey specifically said, don't forward\nthis to family, or friends, or anything.\n\n1442\n01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:04,690\nThis is only for people that work here for\nsome opportunity or something like that.\n\n1443\n01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:08,320\nAnd the thing spread so quickly,\nit was a chance to appear in a movie or\n\n1444\n01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,060\nsomething as an extra.\n\n1445\n01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:13,080\nAnd so it just, it spread like wildfire.\n\n1446\n01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:18,590\nThe email was asking for people to\nprovide what department they worked in,\n\n1447\n01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:21,831\nwhat they did and\na social security number.\n\n1448\n01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,081\nYeah, so like that stuff.\n\n1449\n01:08:23,081 --> 01:08:25,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So they'd set them up with phone number\n\n1450\n01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,520\nand contact info and\nthen social security number.\n\n1451\n01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:32,550\nAnd boom, the thing got spread\nall around the company and\n\n1452\n01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,510\nthen it started going to family and\nfriends.\n\n1453\n01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,830\nIt's like okay, don't give this to\nanybody else but I want to get you in so\n\n1454\n01:08:37,830 --> 01:08:40,765\nwe can get in this movie, so\njust say you're doing this.\n\n1455\n01:08:40,765 --> 01:08:42,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1456\n01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:44,810\nthe pen tester actually\nhad to stop that test.\n\n1457\n01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:45,490\n>> Really?\n\n1458\n01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,250\n>> They had to stop it.\n\n1459\n01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:50,060\nThey had to send out an email saying,\njust stop.\n\n1460\n01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:51,800\nWell because they were getting\nsocial security numbers,\n\n1461\n01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,820\nstuff like that back\nfrom all over the place.\n\n1462\n01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,715\n>> Wow.\n>> They're like, just stop the test.\n\n1463\n01:08:55,715 --> 01:08:58,416\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is turning out to be a bigger mess\n\n1464\n01:08:58,416 --> 01:08:59,957\nthan we thought it was.\n\n1465\n01:08:59,957 --> 01:09:01,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> They expected to just get a few people\n\n1466\n01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,415\nin the company and they got tons\nof people in the company, and\n\n1467\n01:09:04,415 --> 01:09:06,215\ngot their family and friends too.\n\n1468\n01:09:06,215 --> 01:09:07,634\n>> Wow. [LAUGH] >> It's like, just stop,\n\n1469\n01:09:07,634 --> 01:09:11,373\ncuz we can't have this information going\naround, cuz we're gonna get busted.\n\n1470\n01:09:11,373 --> 01:09:16,040\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, that is amazing, but it is,\nI never understood that about people.\n\n1471\n01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:18,387\nYou have a secret,\nyou tell somebody, all right,\n\n1472\n01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:20,660\nwe're just gonna keep this between us,\nright?\n\n1473\n01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:24,990\nBut if they're gonna have to tell one\nperson, they just can't keep it in.\n\n1474\n01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:26,760\nBut they think it's okay\nto tell that one person.\n\n1475\n01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,040\nBut that one person has somebody\nthat they've got to tell,\n\n1476\n01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,910\nand it's not going to stay.\n\n1477\n01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:33,100\nSo yeah, too easy, too easy.\n\n1478\n01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:36,210\n>> And if you tell someone, it's funny,\nif you tell someone something is a secret,\n\n1479\n01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:38,900\nor not to spread it around it makes\nit even worse, it seems to be like.\n\n1480\n01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,490\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n1481\n01:09:39,490 --> 01:09:42,710\n>> I remember hearing that\nduring the development,\n\n1482\n01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:46,640\nwhen Lockheed was doing\ndevelopment of the F-117,\n\n1483\n01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:52,657\nthe Nighthawk fighter, or bomber I\nguess would've been more accurate.\n\n1484\n01:09:52,657 --> 01:09:56,400\nWhen they were doing development of that,\nthey actually had a policy of\n\n1485\n01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,210\nnot stamping blueprints with\nthe top secret designation on it.\n\n1486\n01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:04,960\nThey didn't do that so the reasoning\nbehind it was, if someone got something\n\n1487\n01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,970\nout of the factory and took it someplace,\nthey, it wouldn't draw attention to it.\n\n1488\n01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:11,605\nWhereas, if it said top secret on it,\n\n1489\n01:10:11,605 --> 01:10:15,040\nit was stamped with that security rating\non it, someone could see it and go well,\n\n1490\n01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,245\nthis is important,\nto do a further investigation.\n\n1491\n01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:21,805\nAnd fortunately with that aircraft,\na lot of the systems,\n\n1492\n01:10:21,805 --> 01:10:25,970\nall the systems in\nthe aircraft were just stock\n\n1493\n01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:31,220\nthings that were known in other areas,\nwith a few tweaks not done here or there.\n\n1494\n01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:35,090\nSo, even if someone looked at it and\nsaid oh, that's an old blueprint for\n\n1495\n01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:37,970\nsomething else,\nthey couldn't see the whole picture.\n\n1496\n01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:40,640\nAnd then it definitely was not\nstamped a designation that it was\n\n1497\n01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,210\npart of something new.\n\n1498\n01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:46,610\nIt had a code name, something on it or\nsomething else and no security designation\n\n1499\n01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:49,625\nso they, some of it could go and\nend up in a landfill someplace.\n\n1500\n01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:50,440\n>> [LAUGH] Wow.\n\n1501\n01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:53,300\n>> Yeah, so it's-\n>> So you don't mark it as a secret.\n\n1502\n01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:56,625\nSometimes hiding it in plain sight\nis the best way to go basically.\n\n1503\n01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:59,670\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, really, it really is.\n\n1504\n01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:06,665\nYou tell I mean, you just think about,\nyou tell someone something, fine.\n\n1505\n01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:09,798\nBut if you tell someone hey,\nto keep this between you and I,\n\n1506\n01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:11,748\nthey can't wait to run their mouth.\n\n1507\n01:11:11,748 --> 01:11:14,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They are flapping their gums all up and\n\n1508\n01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,623\nover, all over town and back.\n\n1509\n01:11:16,623 --> 01:11:21,220\nSo the best way to keep your secret\nis not tell someone it's a secret.\n\n1510\n01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:23,910\n>> So don't the conversation with,\nhey, just between you and\n\n1511\n01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:27,192\nme or, wait until you hear,\nnow don't tell anybody, but, yeah.\n\n1512\n01:11:27,192 --> 01:11:28,140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1513\n01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,430\n>> Guaranteed to get it spread.\n\n1514\n01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:34,540\n>> Yeah, and it's definitely effective,\nand Lockheed was a prime example of that.\n\n1515\n01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,982\nYes they had that project,they had,\nit was for\n\n1516\n01:11:38,982 --> 01:11:43,065\nthe stealth fighter, plus other stuff.\n\n1517\n01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:46,623\nIt was actually very fascinating when you\nread the levels of security they had.\n\n1518\n01:11:46,623 --> 01:11:49,035\nThey had very tight security on it.\n\n1519\n01:11:49,035 --> 01:11:52,830\nBut some of the stuff, incidents they\nhad during it were just fascinating.\n\n1520\n01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:58,710\nYou know, they had one in a, Ben Rich who\nran the Skunkworks for a period of time.\n\n1521\n01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,653\n>> It was, he,,\nthey had some incident there,\n\n1522\n01:12:01,653 --> 01:12:04,676\nshows you another form\nof social engineering.\n\n1523\n01:12:04,676 --> 01:12:09,519\nThey had an incident in that program where\nthey were, they, one of the aircraft\n\n1524\n01:12:09,519 --> 01:12:14,508\nthey were gonna build, they needed large\namounts of, it was liquids I forget what\n\n1525\n01:12:14,508 --> 01:12:18,953\nit was Flooring, or something like that,\nreally volatile substance.\n\n1526\n01:12:18,953 --> 01:12:20,185\nBut they had a, they, and\n\n1527\n01:12:20,185 --> 01:12:23,160\nthey were testing it way down in\nsome part of their er, runway.\n\n1528\n01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:25,560\nI think was in you know,\nin pa, in Palmdale.\n\n1529\n01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,530\nAnd what they did is they had a leak in\none of the things that started forming,\n\n1530\n01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:32,720\nlike this this little cloud, type stuff.\n\n1531\n01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,830\nAnd someone called the fire department,\nyou know, and Lockheed had their own,\n\n1532\n01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:39,770\nbut they were like someone\ncalled the local fire.\n\n1533\n01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:42,280\nSo the fire department coming in and\nthey have the model of this\n\n1534\n01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,430\ntop secret aircraft sitting there and\nlike, we can't let these guys see this.\n\n1535\n01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:46,033\nThey're not cleared.\n\n1536\n01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,153\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, there was a judgment call made and\n\n1537\n01:12:48,153 --> 01:12:51,272\nwhat they said is just release\na bunch more of this stuff.\n\n1538\n01:12:51,272 --> 01:12:55,010\nSo there's this big gas cloud and\neverything comes up.\n\n1539\n01:12:55,010 --> 01:12:56,880\nAnd it covered the model and\neverything [LAUGH], so\n\n1540\n01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,930\nwhen the fire department came up,\nthey said, oh yeah.\n\n1541\n01:12:59,930 --> 01:13:03,040\nHe says, yeah, we're just clearing this\nstuff out, we've got it under control, and\n\n1542\n01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,800\nall that, and they never saw it.\n\n1543\n01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,320\nThey're like, okay, is everything fine?\n\n1544\n01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,995\nI'm like, yeah, and they're like,\nwe're venting it out,\n\n1545\n01:13:08,995 --> 01:13:09,520\nand--\n>> Wow.\n\n1546\n01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,350\n>> To keep it safe, so there's no problem,\nand we're like, okay, good.\n\n1547\n01:13:12,350 --> 01:13:15,640\nAnd they all left and they're like, swhoo,\nit's like here's this models on the open\n\n1548\n01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:19,190\nand it's shrouded in clouds you know,\nand, and a little bit of darkness and\n\n1549\n01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,580\nthey said they were just,\nthey got real lucky on that one.\n\n1550\n01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,009\n>> Right.\n>> But someone just said, okay,\n\n1551\n01:13:24,009 --> 01:13:25,116\nrelease the cloud you know?\n\n1552\n01:13:25,116 --> 01:13:25,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1553\n01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:27,810\n>> You know so, it's,\n\n1554\n01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:30,840\nit's it was it was social engi,\nit was social engineering.\n\n1555\n01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,810\nAll of the poli the, the fire department\ncame out, saw that cloud there, and\n\n1556\n01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,290\nit was like yeah, it's a vi,\nit was a volatile gas.\n\n1557\n01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:39,220\nYou're gonna have, we, we could've had\nan explosion, releasing the pressure.\n\n1558\n01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,010\nAnd the stuff is venting out there,\n\n1559\n01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,800\nI'm like okay as long as you\nguys got it under control.\n\n1560\n01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:45,500\nIt's like yeah, our guys are coming\nover to do any hasmat stuff and\n\n1561\n01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:47,090\nall, okay, good.\n\n1562\n01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:50,230\nJust you know, if there's anything else\nyou know, let us know, we're here.\n\n1563\n01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:51,975\nOkay, boom, and disappeared.\n\n1564\n01:13:51,975 --> 01:13:52,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And took off.\n\n1565\n01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,520\nYou know, so, yeah.\n\n1566\n01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,540\n>> Huh, socially.\n\n1567\n01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:58,660\n>> Yeah social engineering, yep.\n\n1568\n01:13:58,660 --> 01:14:01,145\n>> I saw a comment in the chat\nroom from Jeff Sellers.\n\n1569\n01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:03,795\nWe have a company that tests\nour users with phishing emails.\n\n1570\n01:14:03,795 --> 01:14:07,895\nThe first one went out,\nabout 75% of the users opened the email.\n\n1571\n01:14:07,895 --> 01:14:09,455\nNow it is down to under 5%.\n\n1572\n01:14:09,455 --> 01:14:15,380\nSo, you know, an example of how the proper\ntraining h, and education to our users.\n\n1573\n01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:20,060\nWe can, we can prevent a lot of this\nsocial engineering if we know how to,\n\n1574\n01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:22,490\nhow to, how to educate.\n\n1575\n01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:23,660\n>> Yeah.\nEd, education and and\n\n1576\n01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:26,540\nsecurity awareness training is,\nis, is huge.\n\n1577\n01:14:27,645 --> 01:14:32,310\nThere really should be yearly\nsecurity awareness training and I, I,\n\n1578\n01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:34,750\nI truly, I really truly believe that.\n\n1579\n01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:38,370\nIn any company should be yearly stuff and\nit should be a, it should be a brief thing\n\n1580\n01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:42,860\nlike you know, you can an hour or\ntwo where you have a quick discussion on,\n\n1581\n01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:47,500\non things and enough people\nare brought back into the fold on it.\n\n1582\n01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,460\nAnd then that's it.\n\n1583\n01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:51,210\nWhat I don't want to see is,\nI don't want to see you know,\n\n1584\n01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:53,510\nthese, these big full name trains.\n\n1585\n01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:54,410\nThey don't need it.\n\n1586\n01:14:54,410 --> 01:14:57,010\nPeople are going tune out and that's it.\n\n1587\n01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:00,940\nYou know, go through and,\nand, and, and do it over,\n\n1588\n01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,780\ndo it over the course of a week, you know.\n\n1589\n01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,730\nA couple, you know,\nbring a, a few people in.\n\n1590\n01:15:05,730 --> 01:15:08,970\nAnd you know, do an hour or two,\nbring in breakfast and talk about it.\n\n1591\n01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:11,420\nAnd you're gonna get them in there,\nget them engaged.\n\n1592\n01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,610\nYou know, those type of things.\n\n1593\n01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:16,590\nI'd even encourage for things like social\nengineering, sending out, sending out\n\n1594\n01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:20,150\nan email maybe once every couple weeks\nsaying you know, here's your tip.\n\n1595\n01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:21,790\nIt's, it's two or three lines,\n\n1596\n01:15:21,790 --> 01:15:25,480\nsomething they can read and\ndigest really quick, and that's it.\n\n1597\n01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:28,120\nYou know, or maybe once a month\ndoing a five question survey,\n\n1598\n01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,300\nand the person that responds first,\nyou know, you buy, they get,\n\n1599\n01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:35,340\nthey get a free gift card for\nthem and someone to go to lunch.\n\n1600\n01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:38,620\n>> Yeah, I mean you gotta try to\nmake it fun, make it exciting.\n\n1601\n01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:39,980\nBecause these aren't computer people,\nright?\n\n1602\n01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:42,530\nThese aren't people that are in the IT and\ntechnology.\n\n1603\n01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:47,320\nThese are my sales people,\nmy sea-level people, my, my whoever.\n\n1604\n01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:50,298\nThey, they don't care about this stuff,\nit's not exciting to them.\n\n1605\n01:15:50,298 --> 01:15:52,430\nSo we try to make it fun,\nI love the breakfast.\n\n1606\n01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:54,920\nThe lunch and learn type of opportunities.\n\n1607\n01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:58,730\nSmall groups where you keep it really\nsocial and a lot of interaction.\n\n1608\n01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:02,190\nYou get too big of a group and\nit's just one person up there preaching\n\n1609\n01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:05,810\nat everybody and as you said,\nthey're gonna be on their phones texting.\n\n1610\n01:16:05,810 --> 01:16:07,440\nThey're not paying a lick of attention.\n\n1611\n01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,430\nMy freaking boss says I have to be here\nand that's the only reason I'm here,\n\n1612\n01:16:10,430 --> 01:16:11,540\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1613\n01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,202\nBut you make it like small little outings\nor little you know, get-togethers or\n\n1614\n01:16:15,202 --> 01:16:18,700\nwhatever, and you can really reach\na lot more people, I think, and\n\n1615\n01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:21,390\na little more thoroughly when\nyou do it like that, so.\n\n1616\n01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:23,440\nA lot of different techniques\nyou an incorporate.\n\n1617\n01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:27,120\nThe important thing is just doing it,\nand doing it more than once, you know,\n\n1618\n01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,390\nmaking it a regular thing,\nbecause keeping those users educated and\n\n1619\n01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:34,900\nkeeping it fresh in their\nminds is really key.\n\n1620\n01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,350\n>> Well, absolutely.\n\n1621\n01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:40,350\n>> All right, well, anything else we\nwanna throw in on social engineering?\n\n1622\n01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,360\nI, I think we got it.\n\n1623\n01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,800\nI think we're,\nI think we're pretty good on it.\n\n1624\n01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,970\n>> All right.\n\n1625\n01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:44,930\nWell ladies and gentleman.\n\n1626\n01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,570\nThanks for tuning in.\n\n1627\n01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:49,020\nYou know, we learned a lot\ntoday about social engineering.\n\n1628\n01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:52,322\nWe talked about some of\nthe different techniques that we can\n\n1629\n01:16:52,322 --> 01:16:56,603\ndoing social engineering, as well as some\nways that we can try to help protect our,\n\n1630\n01:16:56,603 --> 01:17:00,650\nour companies and\nour networks from the social engineering.\n\n1631\n01:17:00,650 --> 01:17:02,950\nSo remember, if you've got a question\nwhile you're watching this show live,\n\n1632\n01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,610\nall you've got to do is jump\nin that chat room, type away.\n\n1633\n01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:09,700\nWe're here watching, we will respond\nto those questions live on air.\n\n1634\n01:17:09,700 -->

morning, good afternoon and\ngood evening!\n\n5\n00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,300\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,840\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,080\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,980\n>> Doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,540\n>> All right.\nGlad to have you here.\n\n10\n00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,170\nWe are excited about today's episode.\n\n11\n00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,840\nWe are getting ready\nto go into Chapter 11.\n\n12\n00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,350\nHad to take a peek at my\ncheat sheet back here.\n\n13\n00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:53,520\nGetting ready to go into Chapter 11,\nwhich is denial of service, or DoS.\n\n14\n00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,060\nLots of fun stuff here, so\nget ready, and here we go.\n\n15\n00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,600\nSo DoS, is old operating system, no.\n\n16\n00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,109\nNot really, right?\n\n17\n00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,580\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,490\n>> DoS is Denial of Service and\n\n19\n00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,380\nthe name kinda tells us a lot about it,\nright Sean?\n\n20\n00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,810\n>> Yeah, it does reveal a lot about what's\nhappening when we talk about denial\n\n21\n00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,090\nof service.\n\n22\n00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,600\nBut it's really when we talk about\ndenial of service in this context,\n\n23\n00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,190\nit just means what it's ultimate goal is,\n\n24\n00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,060\nbecause we actually have two\nsub classes underneath that.\n\n25\n00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,720\nSo not all denial of\nservices are created equal.\n\n26\n00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,830\n>> All right.\n\n27\n00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,440\nSo at it's basic, denial of service,\nI'm gonna try to make something so\n\n28\n00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,720\nbusy that it can't do what it's\nnormally supposed to do, right?\n\n29\n00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,610\n>> Yeah, that could be, that is\nactually one form of denial of service.\n\n30\n00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,940\nYou can consume enough\nresources on a target,\n\n31\n00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,000\nso other people can't use it for\nlegitimate reasons.\n\n32\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,750\nOther people or services for that matter\ncan't use it for legitimate reasons,\n\n33\n00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,670\nwhatever it was put there for.\n\n34\n00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,460\nSo, yes, you can consume bandwidth,\nyou can consume resources.\n\n35\n00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,120\nThere's actually temporary\ndenial of services,\n\n36\n00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,490\nthere's permanent denial of services,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n37\n00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,410\nSo, there's many variations of how you\ncan carry out denial of service, but\n\n38\n00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,310\nthe ultimate goal is to remove\nthat service from play.\n\n39\n00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,949\nFor some period of time, so\nit just can't be used, so.\n\n40\n00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,531\n>> So in other words,\nif I take a hammer to that router,\n\n41\n00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,906\nthat would be an effective denial\nof service on the network as well.\n\n42\n00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:29,692\n>> Yes, that'd be of the permanent nature.\n\n43\n00:02:29,692 --> 00:02:34,849\n>> [LAUGH] Oh shoot, so\nlots of different categories then,\n\n44\n00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,691\nof denial of service that\nwe're gonna go over here.\n\n45\n00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:40,640\nSo where do you wanna start?\n\n46\n00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,660\nDo you wanna just talk about\nwhat it is we're doing first?\n\n47\n00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,320\nAnd then talk about a few of them.\n\n48\n00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,130\n>> Yeah, let's actually talk about our\ntwo different types of denial of service,\n\n49\n00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:55,270\ncuz I think that's an important\nstep to kind of get across,\n\n50\n00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,260\nis we have a DoS and we have a DDoS.\n\n51\n00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,030\nSo one is denial of service, the other\none is distributed denial of service.\n\n52\n00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,950\nAnd while their ultimate\ngoals are both the same,\n\n53\n00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,620\nthe mechanism of action\nis different on both.\n\n54\n00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,640\nDenial of service, the first one,\n\n55\n00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,276\nthe DoS, is really the old\nschool way of doing things.\n\n56\n00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,550\nWhat you have is when you\ntalk about denial of service,\n\n57\n00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:24,210\nit means I have one attacker\ngoing after a target.\n\n58\n00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,690\nWith the idea that they're going to\ndo something to keep that system from\n\n59\n00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,220\ndoing whatever it's supposed to be doing.\n\n60\n00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,820\nYou know, sort of tie it up.\n\n61\n00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,020\nWhen you talk of a DDoS, that's\na Distributed Denial of Service, and\n\n62\n00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,610\nagain, while the goal is still the same,\nit's much,\n\n63\n00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,500\nmuch different in the way you\nset it up and carry it out.\n\n64\n00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,320\nIn fact, it would've involve some\nof the things that we've seen prior\n\n65\n00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,320\nto really make it happen.\n\n66\n00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,231\nWhen you talk a DDoS,distributed\ndenial of service,\n\n67\n00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:04,240\nthat kind of dances around\nwhat's happening, but not quite.\n\n68\n00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,040\nA way to look at a DDoS is\nto look at it as a bot net.\n\n69\n00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,100\nBecause that's what it is.\n\n70\n00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,680\nIt is a bot net.\n\n71\n00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,860\nWhat we have is a number of attackers,\n\n72\n00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:22,440\nbasically dog-piling on a victim, to the\npoint where there's no way it can respond.\n\n73\n00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,660\nI can do something with one attacker by\nthrowing more resources at my system,\n\n74\n00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,950\nto prevent that attacker\nfrom overwhelming it.\n\n75\n00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,010\nThat's relatively easy.\n\n76\n00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,550\nBut if I have several thousand\nattacks dog-piling on a server,\n\n77\n00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,490\nthen that becomes a little\nmore difficult to stop.\n\n78\n00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,240\nBecause there's only so much you can do.\n\n79\n00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,300\nYeah, you can throw more bandwidth at it,\nand more bandwidth, and more bandwidth,\n\n80\n00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,970\nbut to a point, you can't stem\nthe tide and it's gonna tap it.\n\n81\n00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,814\nSo that's the thing about it.\n\n82\n00:04:56,814 --> 00:04:59,822\nIt's an interesting part, just this\nhuge scale that we're talking about.\n\n83\n00:04:59,822 --> 00:05:04,644\n>> Really, the distributed denial of\nservice is just letting me become\n\n84\n00:05:04,644 --> 00:05:06,566\na more powerful attacker.\n\n85\n00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:09,188\nBecause with my one system,\nI might pick a target, but\n\n86\n00:05:09,188 --> 00:05:11,640\nlet's say I'm trying to\nbring down some website.\n\n87\n00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,160\nI try to send so\nmany requests to that website,\n\n88\n00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,940\nthat it's unable to respond fast\nenough and it starts to bog down.\n\n89\n00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,140\nThat's the goal anyway, but the web server\ncould very well have more bandwidth and\n\n90\n00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,020\nmore resources available than\nmy puny little connection\n\n91\n00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,943\nthat I have at my house and my machine.\n\n92\n00:05:26,943 --> 00:05:30,629\nBut if I take multiple machines, and\nhave them all pound that web server at\n\n93\n00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,899\nthe same time, now it might be able\nto compete and even surmount or\n\n94\n00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:38,020\nsurpass the resources that the web server\nhas, and then get my denial of service.\n\n95\n00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,138\nYeah, absolutely,\nthat's what's actually is taking place.\n\n96\n00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:47,627\nWe have this massive scale going in,\nand you can't really,\n\n97\n00:05:47,627 --> 00:05:53,716\nas a victim you can only stand there for\nso long before you're gonna get taken out.\n\n98\n00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:56,692\nAnd it's not a question of if\nyou're gonna get taken out,\n\n99\n00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:59,440\nit's a question of when\nyou're gonna get taken out.\n\n100\n00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,680\nAnd the numbers are surprisingly low.\n\n101\n00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,000\nBelieve it or not,\nnumbers are very low that it takes to\n\n102\n00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,130\nknock out some of the leading websites.\n\n103\n00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,550\nVisa for example.\n\n104\n00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,760\nAt one point, it got knocked out\nby only 700 concurrent users.\n\n105\n00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,500\n>> Really?\n>> You would expect much more\n\n106\n00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,330\nthan that right?\n\n107\n00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:20,910\nLike maybe 1,000.\n\n108\n00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,610\n>> On a great day,\n\n109\n00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,200\nyou would think Visa would have more\nthan 700 people visiting their site.\n\n110\n00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,900\nYeah, it was 700 concurrent\nconnections to it.\n\n111\n00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,520\nIt was enough to swamp that site and\nknock it out.\n\n112\n00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,340\nAnd there was another payment processor,\nI can't remember who it is,\n\n113\n00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,670\nit was only about 1,000.\n\n114\n00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,730\nSo it wasn't as high as you would think.\n\n115\n00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,520\nAnd that's since been remediated, so\n\n116\n00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,350\nit's higher now, but\nit actually did happen that way.\n\n117\n00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,450\nAnd it wasn't too long ago\nthat that actually occurred,\n\n118\n00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,250\nit was a fascinating thing.\n\n119\n00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,540\nCuz you'd expect it to be,\noh, way, way up there.\n\n120\n00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,630\nIt's like, no,\nwe're not even over 1000 at that yet.\n\n121\n00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,150\nWe stop at 1000 connections\nis where it was doing it.\n\n122\n00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,310\n>> And we've probably all seen\nsomething like this happen.\n\n123\n00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,320\nBecause it's a game that we\nhave to play as a company,\n\n124\n00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,600\nas a guy that's responsible for\nhosting our web services.\n\n125\n00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,340\nWe try at look at what kind of response we\nexpect, what kind of service we need to\n\n126\n00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,380\nprovide, what's our acceptable level of\nservice, and we try to provide that with\n\n127\n00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,520\na little bit of cushion, for growth, and\nunexpected spikes, and things like that.\n\n128\n00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,150\nBut at the same time I don't want to\ngo out and get four times what I need.\n\n129\n00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:33,760\nI can't afford that,\nthat's not in my budget.\n\n130\n00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,710\nSo you see this all the time where, in\nnewsgroups and in chat rooms like we have\n\n131\n00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,610\nhere, we mention a URL, and\nmaybe they're not a big organization and\n\n132\n00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,338\nthey don't get more than\na few visitors a day.\n\n133\n00:07:45,338 --> 00:07:48,465\nAnd then somewhere popular mentions\ntheir name, and all of a sudden,\n\n134\n00:07:48,465 --> 00:07:51,805\nyou've got four times as many people\nthat are normally going to that site.\n\n135\n00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,486\nSo you end up doing a denial of service,\nnot intentionally, but it happens.\n\n136\n00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,709\nSo, we're taking that same concept and\nwe're doing it intentionally, right?\n\n137\n00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:04,128\nWe're getting our bot net Which\nwe'll talk about what a botnet is,\n\n138\n00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:08,310\ngetting that to do all of the work for us.\n\n139\n00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,520\n>> I think that's a good entry point to\ntalk about what a botnet is, actually.\n\n140\n00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,550\nYou opened the door for that so we'll go\nthrough that, we'll go down that route.\n\n141\n00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,650\nSo, a botnet.\n\n142\n00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,470\nWhy is it so effective?\n\n143\n00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,200\nHow does it work and why is it so\neffective at taking out a target?\n\n144\n00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,310\nWell, a botnet, really what you have,\nit's set up in really a number of stages.\n\n145\n00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,220\nIf you wanna do it right,\nit's set up in a number of stages.\n\n146\n00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,810\nWhat you'll do is, you'll have\nthe person that's actually in control.\n\n147\n00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,290\nThe master that's in charge\nof this whole thing.\n\n148\n00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,260\nYou can kinda look at that as like\nthe general of the whole thing.\n\n149\n00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,120\nAnd so what that person does, is that\nperson will at some point compromise\n\n150\n00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,390\nsome servers or\nsomething that's publicly accessible.\n\n151\n00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,610\nIt could be web servers.\n\n152\n00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,370\nIt could be DHCP.\n\n153\n00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,340\nIt's probably gonna be web servers and\nDNS, to tell you the truth.\n\n154\n00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:03,830\nThey compromise them, and one of the more\ncommon ways once they compromise them,\n\n155\n00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,260\nthey'll push like an IRC\nchat server onto them.\n\n156\n00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,710\nOnce they compromise those, they'll put a\nprivate channel, that IRC server on there,\n\n157\n00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,840\nput a private channel and\nput a password on so\n\n158\n00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,190\nno one else can view it or go into it, and\nthey have that part of the process done.\n\n159\n00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:24,610\nThen those guys basically become\nthe commanders out in the field.\n\n160\n00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,090\nNow what they have to do is they have\nto build the army, their foot soldiers.\n\n161\n00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,046\nSo the way to do that is they figure out\na way to distribute software in such\n\n162\n00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:37,029\na way that it's gonna hit\nthe greatest number of people and\n\n163\n00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:42,087\nhave the greatest number of chances\nof sticking and staying on a station.\n\n164\n00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,886\nAnd you could choose a lot\nof distribution methods.\n\n165\n00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:49,946\nWe talked about trojans\nearlier on in our episodes.\n\n166\n00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:55,170\nWhen you look at trojans,\ntrojans are a perfect delivery mechanism.\n\n167\n00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,598\nIf I wanted to distribute the software\nto make my botnet happen,\n\n168\n00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,430\nif I wanna distribute\nit as fast as possible,\n\n169\n00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,680\nI'm probably go up to something\nlike BitTorrent, for example, and\n\n170\n00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,610\ndownload maybe the top five\nmost popular executables or\n\n171\n00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,740\napplications off there, trojan them,\nand then reseed them on the network.\n\n172\n00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,240\nAnd that way I know, since they're\npopular, people are gonna look for\n\n173\n00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,970\nthose things, they're gonna download them,\nand I have a really\n\n174\n00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,100\nbig possibility I'm gonna get a lot of\npeople that are gonna get infected.\n\n175\n00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,440\nOnce they're infected, my Trojan or\n\n176\n00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,900\nwhatever malware I've placed on there, it\nwill actually be programmed to phone home.\n\n177\n00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,920\nIt's gonna phone these\nservers in sequence.\n\n178\n00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,300\nIt's gonna have one preferred one.\n\n179\n00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,930\nIf that one's not available,\nit's gonna go to another one.\n\n180\n00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,800\nAnd what we'll look for on those servers,\nis we'll look for that IRC\n\n181\n00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,450\nchat server with that channel that's\nhidden and it will contact it and\n\n182\n00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,400\ngive it the password and it will see\nif there's any messages up there.\n\n183\n00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,680\nWhen it processes that message, that\nmessage won't be a human readable message.\n\n184\n00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:05,210\nIt will be an instruction that tells it go\nafter a target at a certain date and time.\n\n185\n00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,750\nAnd usually what you do is you set\nthat date sometime down the road.\n\n186\n00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,110\nNot tomorrow, but maybe three days from\nnow, five days from now, seven days from\n\n187\n00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,970\nnow, with the idea being that you want to\ngive it enough time where enough people in\n\n188\n00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,040\nyour botnet that can process that and be\non standby mode for when that time hits.\n\n189\n00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,600\nIf you do it too soon,\nyou haven't got enough time for\n\n190\n00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,390\npeople to turn on their systems and\nprocess those instructions.\n\n191\n00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,880\nSo once you have enough of those things\nhappening in that zero hour hits,\n\n192\n00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,230\nall of these bots in this botnet turn\ntheir attention towards the target, and\n\n193\n00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,893\njust beat up on it and take it out.\n\n194\n00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:43,099\nIt's very elegant.\n\n195\n00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:47,840\nIt seems very complex but it's also\nvery elegant in the way it takes place.\n\n196\n00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,810\nThere's so many things occurring.\n\n197\n00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,574\nYou'll see a lot of these\nbotnets out there in the wild,\n\n198\n00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:55,670\nthere's plenty of botnets.\n\n199\n00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,724\nAmazingly enough you can not\nonly build your own botnet,\n\n200\n00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:02,485\nthere's software for it,\nnot that I'm recommending that you do it.\n\n201\n00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:07,710\nThere's also botnets you can rent.\n\n202\n00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,500\nEasily enough, you can rent a botnet.\n\n203\n00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,580\n>> I need 10,000 nodes that can\nrespond to a command that's 10 PM on\n\n204\n00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,270\nthe second of April.\n\n205\n00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,180\n>> You literally, you joke around about\nit, but yeah those actually really exist.\n\n206\n00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,390\nYou can go to YouTube now, and there's\nservices that accept Bitcoin as payment,\n\n207\n00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,020\nand they have commercials\nthat they've made.\n\n208\n00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,570\nThere literally\nare commercials that say hey,\n\n209\n00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:34,950\ndo you need to take out your competitor?\n\n210\n00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,900\nDo you need revenge?\n\n211\n00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,350\nDo you wanna send a statement?\n\n212\n00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,330\nThey say, we've got you.\n\n213\n00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,619\nAnd they have a price list\nof size of business and\n\n214\n00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:44,999\nhow long you want\nthe denial-of-service for.\n\n215\n00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:45,750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n216\n00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,180\nthey accept their payments in Bitcoin.\n\n217\n00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,580\n>> Wow.\n>> So you can make that.\n\n218\n00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,650\nSo yes, there's literally\ncommercials up on YouTube for that.\n\n219\n00:12:54,650 --> 00:13:00,890\nThey tell you how to contact them, how to\npay them, and what they can do for you.\n\n220\n00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,650\nAnd they'll do all sorts\nof denial-of-services.\n\n221\n00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:09,690\nIf you've got the money, got the Bitcoin,\nthey will go after a target for you.\n\n222\n00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,950\nThat's the end of it.\n\n223\n00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,725\nSo you don't even need\nto set it up anymore.\n\n224\n00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:17,172\n>> Somebody to do all the dirty work and\nI just rent their time.\n\n225\n00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,647\nI like it.\n\n226\n00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:23,645\nSo in the end, a botnet then is just\na way that I can kinda multiply my\n\n227\n00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:25,891\nattack right, where we can.\n\n228\n00:13:25,891 --> 00:13:29,471\nAs Sean said, I might be the general,\nor the commander,\n\n229\n00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,949\nand I've got my field generals,\nsome compromised servers our there,\n\n230\n00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:38,652\nthat are running an IRC channel and\nI've got all my compromised machines,\n\n231\n00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,079\nmy bots, that are reporting back\nto their particular field general.\n\n232\n00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:45,589\nSo then I send out that\ncommand to my field generals,\n\n233\n00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:49,010\nthose guys check into that IRC room,\nthey get issued their commands and\n\n234\n00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:51,195\nthen they launch the attach synchronously.\n\n235\n00:13:51,195 --> 00:13:53,635\nThey all start attacking at the same time.\n\n236\n00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:56,145\nThat's what gives me the power\nto take on bigger and\n\n237\n00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:59,925\nbigger targets, is the bigger and\nbigger my botnet is.\n\n238\n00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:01,745\nAnd Ozzy, as you said,\nit's pretty darn easy.\n\n239\n00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:06,860\nI like your trick with trojaning a really\npopular download of some BitTorrent,\n\n240\n00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,720\nI think somebody in the chatroom\nmentioned phishing emails.\n\n241\n00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,250\nYou might send out an email that has a\nlink that does something, but in the back\n\n242\n00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:18,810\nit installs some kind of client, and\nhonestly, they probably never know, right?\n\n243\n00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,010\nThey don't even know their machine's\nbeing used as part of the attack.\n\n244\n00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,110\n>> Yeah, that's the interesting part,\nis that they may indeed not know.\n\n245\n00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,130\nIt's not like when you have\none system attacking another.\n\n246\n00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,740\nWhen you have one system attacking\nanother in traditional DOS,\n\n247\n00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,290\nyou're gonna see that because it takes so\nmuch to actually carry that out.\n\n248\n00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:45,540\nBut if you have a botnet, it's a lot less\nlikely that someone's gonna pick that up.\n\n249\n00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,510\nAnd the reason is is\nthat while in a DOS you\n\n250\n00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,130\nhave one system attacking another is a lot\nof activity going on to make that happen,\n\n251\n00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,190\nbecause you only have\nthe resources of one system.\n\n252\n00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,240\nBut, if you go to a botnet,\n\n253\n00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,112\nwhat actually occurs is that in\na bot net you have all these\n\n254\n00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:10,330\nnumerous systems out there, but\neach one's only doing a small bit.\n\n255\n00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:17,320\nEach one may be sending a ping every\nfew seconds, or maybe one per second.\n\n256\n00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,510\nIt can vary depending\non how I configured it.\n\n257\n00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:21,800\nBut that's not a lot.\n\n258\n00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,480\nThat's a drop in the bucket.\n\n259\n00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,260\nAnd a drop in the bucket, as we know, is\nlike you've got a drop in the bucket here,\n\n260\n00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,850\na drop in the bucket here,\na drop in the bucket here.\n\n261\n00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,246\nBut if you multiply that\nby a lot of people,\n\n262\n00:15:34,246 --> 00:15:39,146\nthat bucket's gonna get\nfull pretty quickly.\n\n263\n00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:44,334\nAnd that's how this actually works,\nis that little blip,\n\n264\n00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:49,833\nblip, blip isn't going to be\nnoticeable by a user typically,\n\n265\n00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:56,498\nbut the victim's gonna see that because\nthere's thousands of instances.\n\n266\n00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,250\n>> 50,000 little drops\ncoming at him at one time,\n\n267\n00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,919\nso Even though the individual nodes\naren't taking a lot of resources,\n\n268\n00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:05,380\nthe user's still using their system,\nmaybe.\n\n269\n00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,990\nOr maybe do it in the middle of the night.\n\n270\n00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,579\nThey don't notice, but that target\nsure does, because he's got 50,000,\n\n271\n00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:11,830\n100,000 of those guys coming at him.\n\n272\n00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,190\nHowever big your botnet is.\n\n273\n00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,020\n>> Yeah, and that's something\nelse to kind of throw into it.\n\n274\n00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,020\nHow big do these botnets get?\n\n275\n00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:20,680\nThese botnet,\n\n276\n00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,940\nusually they say it takes about\n30,000 really to kinda notice and any\n\n277\n00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,150\nsort of appreciable behavior with a botnet\nwhen you're attacking a large target.\n\n278\n00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:35,960\nBut, you know, they could be 30,000, but\nthey can also be much higher than that.\n\n279\n00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,320\nThere’s at least a small number of\n\n280\n00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,760\ninstances where people can claim\nseveral million bots in their botnet.\n\n281\n00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,350\nAnd if you have a several\nmillion-man army,\n\n282\n00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:50,240\nyou can smoke just about\nany server on the planet.\n\n283\n00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,260\nI want to say all of them, but\nMom always told me you can't say all.\n\n284\n00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,380\n>> Right.\n\n285\n00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,050\n>> But, we'll say that just about nobody\nis going to be able to withstand.\n\n286\n00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,690\nThat's a withering amount of traffic.\n\n287\n00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,160\n>> I mean, with that much, you're getting\nclose to taking down root DNS servers, and\n\n288\n00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,080\nthings like that with that kind of stuff.\n\n289\n00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,790\n>> They have.\nThey have slowed those ones down\n\n290\n00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,630\nsubstantially.\n\n291\n00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,260\nSo it's something really.\n\n292\n00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,540\nIt's really kind of sobering to think\nabout those things are out there\n\n293\n00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,940\nthat they can do that.\n\n294\n00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,270\nAnd yeah, you can rent those.\n\n295\n00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,890\nThey don't cost that much to rent.\n\n296\n00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,240\nSomeone ticks you off, you could go and\nrent these things for,\n\n297\n00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,010\nprobably if you pay 200 or 300 dollars you\ncould rent the thing for a day or two and\n\n298\n00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,453\njust beat up on someone's server and\nsmoke it.\n\n299\n00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You really could.\n\n300\n00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,950\n>> Now before you guys try to go out\nthere and try to rent any botnets,\n\n301\n00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,750\nremember, these are criminals.\n\n302\n00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,650\nSo, you know,\ntrusting them with your money,\n\n303\n00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:47,215\ngiving them your credit card number,\nmight not be such a good idea, all right?\n\n304\n00:17:47,215 --> 00:17:50,549\n[LAUGH] Just thought I'd throw\nthat disclaimer out there,\n\n305\n00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:52,940\njust in case anybody was getting an idea.\n\n306\n00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,276\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well don't worry,\n\n307\n00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:55,402\nI'll act as your agent.\n\n308\n00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:56,716\nSo just send me your money.\n\n309\n00:17:56,716 --> 00:18:01,820\n>> I take 30% and then no problem.\n\n310\n00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,594\n>> And with a face like that,\nwho wouldn't trust you, right?\n\n311\n00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n312\n00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,130\nLook, let me do the face.\n\n313\n00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,215\n>> There you go, look,\nthat's an honest face right there.\n\n314\n00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,335\n[LAUGH] Here's my wallet.\n\n315\n00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:16,750\n[LAUGH]\n>> I don't always attack people, but\n\n316\n00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,355\nwhen I do- [LAUGH] I always\nchoose 30% commission.\n\n317\n00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:25,670\n[LAUGH]\n>> Nice, nice, nice.\n\n318\n00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:28,820\nAlright, so we talked about a couple of\ndifferent types of denial of service.\n\n319\n00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,810\nWe're going to break it down.\n\n320\n00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:33,270\nWe've got our denial of service\nsingle machine attacking a target.\n\n321\n00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,910\nAnd then we've got our distributed denial\nof service, where we take that attack and\n\n322\n00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:39,500\nwe distribute it across\nwhat we call a botnet.\n\n323\n00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,460\nAnd these botnets are just computers that\nhave been compromised, and are waiting.\n\n324\n00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,180\nThey're listening for a command.\n\n325\n00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,190\nIRC channels are a very common way for\nus to issue that command.\n\n326\n00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,710\nOld BBS type systems, things like\nthat where these guys just check in\n\n327\n00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,740\nperiodically, looking for a new message,\nand then when it's time to trigger\n\n328\n00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,370\nthe attack, I launch that command and that\ngets distributed out to all those bots on\n\n329\n00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,360\nthe bot net, and then we launch a massive\nattack and we have much more attack power,\n\n330\n00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,355\nbecause we could have hundreds, thousands,\nor hundreds of thousands of machines.\n\n331\n00:19:09,355 --> 00:19:12,260\n[INAUDIBLE] Hundreds of thousands,\nmillions maybe at some point.\n\n332\n00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,088\n>> You could, but\nOn average a few tens of thousands of bots\n\n333\n00:19:17,088 --> 00:19:22,220\nin that network,\nwhich is really a lot of attack power.\n\n334\n00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,490\n>> You're talking a little investment and\n\n335\n00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,310\ntime with a DDOS to set it up\n>> But\n\n336\n00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:34,490\nonce you have that,\nit's as a tremendous force multiplier.\n\n337\n00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,240\nWhere you could have done a DoS before,\nnow you can do a DDoS and\n\n338\n00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,960\njust crush just about anything out there,\nand like I said, think about it.\n\n339\n00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,410\nIf you have 30,000 systems and\n\n340\n00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,720\nit only took 700 to 1,000 to knock\nout major payment processor sites,\n\n341\n00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,260\nyeah, you're going to\ncrush something with that.\n\n342\n00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,020\n>> Absolutely.\n>> I mean, you could probably go out,\n\n343\n00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,940\nyou could go after large corporations,\ngovernment websites, stuff like that, and\n\n344\n00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,320\nstomp them into the ground\neffectively like that.\n\n345\n00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,820\n>> All right ladies and gentlemen.\n\n346\n00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,330\nLooking at our clock, it's about time for\n\n347\n00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,350\nus to take our break so\nwe're gonna step away for a minute.\n\n348\n00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,540\nWhen we come back we're going to\ntalk more about denial of service.\n\n349\n00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,530\nSo stay tuned.\n\n350\n00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,682\nWe'll be right back.\n\n351\n00:20:17,682 --> 00:20:23,767\n[SOUND]\n>> All right.\n\n352\n00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,380\nWelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n353\n00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,940\nGetting ready to continue on\nwith our Denial of Service.\n\n354\n00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,310\nSo what's next on our menu for\nDenial of Service?\n\n355\n00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,400\n>> Yeah, let's talk about the different\ntypes of Denial of Service, and\n\n356\n00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,990\nwhat that means.\n\n357\n00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:38,660\nBecause not all Denial of\nServices are the same.\n\n358\n00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,610\nWe talk about two major categories.\n\n359\n00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:45,050\nNow we kind of go and drill into those and\nsee okay, what that really means.\n\n360\n00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,130\n>> All right.\nSo we talked about the two,\n\n361\n00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,890\nwhat he was referring to.\n\n362\n00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,812\nWe've got the DoS, the denial-of-service,\nas well as distributed denial-of-service,\n\n363\n00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:52,720\nor a DDoS.\n\n364\n00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,180\nBut we can break that down\nfurther into different types.\n\n365\n00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,710\nSo what do we want to start with first.\n\n366\n00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,940\n>> Just FYI for\nall of you playing along here at home.\n\n367\n00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,241\nSomething I think is really worth\nbringing up here is when you do go,\n\n368\n00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:14,240\nwhen you do go in and take the CEH exam,\ndo remember, there's DoS and DDoS okay?\n\n369\n00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,750\nAnd like I said,\nthey both have the same goal, but\n\n370\n00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,120\nthey are carried out differently.\n\n371\n00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,360\nThey will make that distinction and\n\n372\n00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,670\ntherefore you have to\nmake that distinction.\n\n373\n00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,800\nOut in the real world you tell me DoS or\n\n374\n00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,360\nDDoS, I'll figure it\nout just like you will.\n\n375\n00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,630\nYou know when we start talking about\nthe different mechanics of it.\n\n376\n00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,010\nBut you know,\n\n377\n00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:39,330\njust FYI that's a test tip from me to you\nthat you want to kind of keep in mind.\n\n378\n00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,460\n>> And the key to differentiate would\nbe the number of nodes involved in\n\n379\n00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,410\nthe attack.\n\n380\n00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,545\nExactly.\n>> Not the target but\n\n381\n00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:45,660\non the attack side, right?\n\n382\n00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,260\n>> Exactly,\n\n383\n00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,300\nthe set up and staging of the attack is\nway different for one versus the other.\n\n384\n00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,330\n>> So read that question carefully,\npay attention to what they're telling you,\n\n385\n00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,820\nfrom about that attack side so you can\nfigure out of it’s a DoS or a DDoS.\n\n386\n00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,290\n>> Yeah,\nthis is one of those cases where I had it,\n\n387\n00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,740\nI remember having it screamed at me\nduring training of all different types.\n\n388\n00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:10,370\n>> It's attention to detail\nwhen you're doing this.\n\n389\n00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,440\nWhen you're doing any sort of pen test or\nanything like that,\n\n390\n00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,630\nattention to detail is a huge thing.\n\n391\n00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,620\nIt's the devil's in the details.\n\n392\n00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,841\nIf you don't pay attention to\nthem you will miss something.\n\n393\n00:22:18,841 --> 00:22:22,390\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n394\n00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:29,300\nAll right, just a few different type\nof denial service that we can perform.\n\n395\n00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,770\nMeaning that there's different ways\nI can try to accomplish the goal\n\n396\n00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:36,110\nwhether I'm using a single machine for the\nattack or whether I'm using a botnet for\n\n397\n00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:38,230\nthe attack, what is the attack, right?\n\n398\n00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,290\nWhat are we actually doing to try\nto bring this service down or\n\n399\n00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,978\nremove this service from serviceability,\nif I could use that?\n\n400\n00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:47,512\nThat works.\n\n401\n00:22:47,512 --> 00:22:50,420\n[LAUGH]\n>> You guys know what I mean.\n\n402\n00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,170\n>> It's Friday, we can say what we want.\n\n403\n00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,090\n>> Right, [LAUGH] It might be for\nall you know if you're watching the tape.\n\n404\n00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,610\n>> Wait, mute it,\nthey don't know we're not,\n\n405\n00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,185\nthat we're doing this on Tuesday, right?\n\n406\n00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:01,751\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, it's Friday!\n\n407\n00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:05,650\n>> We're going down with the moon landing,\nit's all fake, none of it's live.\n\n408\n00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,890\n>> Yeah, yeah we filmed\nthe moon landing on this set.\n\n409\n00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,480\n>> That's right.\n\n410\n00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,580\n>> That's what those computers\nback in that hole are.\n\n411\n00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,501\nThat was mission control we just\nreassembled it for this so, sh.\n\n412\n00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:17,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so\n\n413\n00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:19,530\nwhat do we want to start with,\nwhat's our first one?\n\n414\n00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,950\n>> Let's talk about some of the basic\ndenial of services that happen.\n\n415\n00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,140\nWe have other ones like DNS and\nDHCP and syn floods and\n\n416\n00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,210\nall those interesting things, but\nlets go back to some of the very,\n\n417\n00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,580\nvery early ones we had, and\nthese actually still do take place.\n\n418\n00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:43,040\nOne of the ones we have is,\ndenial of service against a website.\n\n419\n00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,760\nAnd that was one of the first\nones that you really saw.\n\n420\n00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,950\nAnd you saw your first denial\nof services way back when\n\n421\n00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,050\nthe Internet was brand new to everybody.\n\n422\n00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,459\nLike wow, a new thing.\n\n423\n00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:54,432\nAnd people were setting up web servers.\n\n424\n00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:56,000\nAnd they didn't really have a gauge,\n\n425\n00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,868\nremember with the Internet\nbeing brand new.\n\n426\n00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:01,197\nThey don't have an idea of what traffic\npatterns are gonna look like, so\n\n427\n00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:05,740\nthey hadn't scaled them out and about load\nbalancing and stuff like we have today.\n\n428\n00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,450\nSo it didn't take much\nto knock those over.\n\n429\n00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,200\nSo you could take out a web\nsite with little effort.\n\n430\n00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,810\nNowadays, that's where your denial\ndistributing services come in because\n\n431\n00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:23,200\nthose actually can knockout\nbigger websites and websites\n\n432\n00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,310\nare very popularly target for people\nto deny service, even to this very day.\n\n433\n00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:35,180\nWe can knock out a website\nwith some effort.\n\n434\n00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:41,110\nAnd it's done to send a political\nstatement in some cases.\n\n435\n00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,580\nIn some cases it's done\nto just tick someone off.\n\n436\n00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,550\nYou name it.\n\n437\n00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,900\nThey've actually denied\nthe service of a lot of websites.\n\n438\n00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,140\nYou can find a website today that's been\ndenial of service and it's also worth\n\n439\n00:24:54,140 --> 00:25:00,320\nadding, sometimes denial of services\naren't something that's done intentional.\n\n440\n00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,480\nWith or, I should say,\nwith malicious intent.\n\n441\n00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,280\nSometimes it's done just because.\n\n442\n00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,420\nI don't know if you've ever\nheard of the slash dot effect?\n\n443\n00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,840\n>> Yes.\nAbsolutely.\n\n444\n00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,060\n>> They also have one called\nthe fark effect or something.\n\n445\n00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:19,040\nAnother one named after fark.com and\nin both cases what would happen is,\n\n446\n00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,570\nlike in slash dot, the one where\nwe really heard about this first.\n\n447\n00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,010\nIs they'd post a link and\n\n448\n00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,810\nsince slash dot had so many visitors,\na link would get posted.\n\n449\n00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:35,570\nEveryone would see that link and just\nwould go en mass over to that website and\n\n450\n00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,290\ndenial of service it,\nbecause of the flow of traffic,\n\n451\n00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,740\nthis big spike of traffic coming in,\nso that's an, that's kind\n\n452\n00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,710\nof an unintentional, accidental, whatever\nyou want to call it, denial of service.\n\n453\n00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,390\nBut it still is denial of service,\n\n454\n00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,790\nespecially one of the people\nthat came in afterwards.\n\n455\n00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,580\nBut it was usually pretty brief it\nlasted for some period of time and\n\n456\n00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,280\nthen services were restored.\n\n457\n00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,630\nMaybe the site owner is like,\nwhat the heck just happened?\n\n458\n00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,470\nBut it did happen.\n\n459\n00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:08,860\nIt showed you and it still does show\nus that websites are vulnerable.\n\n460\n00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,910\n>> Absolutely.\n>> They're all very prime targets.\n\n461\n00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,880\n>> It's just a resource.\n\n462\n00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,030\nI mean, something has to be\nserving up those webpages,\n\n463\n00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,900\nand the more requests that are coming in,\nmore resources I need to serve those up.\n\n464\n00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,190\nAnd I've seen situations too where\nyou have that, the slash dot effect.\n\n465\n00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,550\nAnd the visitors go away, right?\n\n466\n00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:30,120\nThe initial surge goes down but\nit was my website.\n\n467\n00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,080\nI'm getting it hosted by Go Daddy and\n\n468\n00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,170\nI've got a cap on the bandwidth that I can\nuse per month, and you guys just hit it.\n\n469\n00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,100\nRight, in that one day.\n\n470\n00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,270\nSo now for the rest of the month I'm down\nor I've got to go pay an exorbitant amount\n\n471\n00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,970\nof money to go beyond my cap and\nthings like that.\n\n472\n00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,990\nSo.\n\n473\n00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:49,020\nIt's kind of, not funny when that happens,\nbut it definitely does happen.\n\n474\n00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,880\n>> Yeah, you bring up another\nvariation of the analyst service.\n\n475\n00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,925\nWhat if I chewed up all your resource?\n\n476\n00:26:56,925 --> 00:26:59,585\nIn this case, I've chewed up all your\nbandwidth that you've been allocated.\n\n477\n00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:00,235\nIt's gone.\n\n478\n00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:02,565\nNext thing you've gotta dump\nas a resource out is money.\n\n479\n00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:03,515\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n480\n00:27:03,515 --> 00:27:06,875\n>> So\nI could effectively burn that up, too.\n\n481\n00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,412\nAnd if you're a business website, yeah.\n\n482\n00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:13,412\nYou're going to spend money on it because\ncould be in your e-commerce storefront.\n\n483\n00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,282\n>> Yeah that might be the only way that\nI have of actually making money and\n\n484\n00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:18,032\ngenerating more revenue to pay for\n\n485\n00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:21,862\nthe hosting fees is to sell product,\nis to get that out there.\n\n486\n00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,272\nAnd like you said,\na very common target website,\n\n487\n00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:27,642\nbecause it's one of the ways that\nI think gets a lot of exposure.\n\n488\n00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:30,492\nIf somebody's website is down,\nit's very obvious, right.\n\n489\n00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:31,132\nIf I go to Newegg,\n\n490\n00:27:31,132 --> 00:27:36,100\nI'm trying to buy a computer part, I go\npunch in Newegg.com and the sites down.\n\n491\n00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,080\nIt's immediate.\n\n492\n00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,470\nSomething's wrong with this site.\n\n493\n00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,450\nSo if I can do an attack on a company,\nif I can attack their website,\n\n494\n00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,990\nthat's gonna be a very visible\nresult to all of their customers.\n\n495\n00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,970\nSo it is a very common target and\nit's a very want to say easy target, but\n\n496\n00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,060\nit has to be out there.\n\n497\n00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,700\nI mean, the whole reason I have\na website is so that people can come and\n\n498\n00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,050\nbuy product or read my website or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n499\n00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,940\nSo it's not like they can cut it off\nfrom the internet and protect it, right?\n\n500\n00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:06,610\nI can't just lock it in a closet,\nI've got to expose it.\n\n501\n00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,570\nWhich means I've got, there are vectors\nthat people would then try to\n\n502\n00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:13,430\ntake advantage of and try to attack that.\n\n503\n00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,270\n>> Yeah.\nIt's, that's absolutely 100% correct.\n\n504\n00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:20,580\nThe website is now tends to\nbe one of the most visible\n\n505\n00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,180\nthings that you have as a company.\n\n506\n00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,550\nIt represents who you are.\n\n507\n00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,040\nIt's you planting your flag\nout on the Internet saying.\n\n508\n00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,390\nMy spay, and this is not My Space but\nmy space [LAUGH] that I'm claiming.\n\n509\n00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:38,620\nMy Space is something different [LAUGH]\nunless your like really young no my space\n\n510\n00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,350\nis what I mean here but\n\n511\n00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,980\nyou're claiming that chunk of real estate\nyou know, I think internet buying.\n\n512\n00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,750\nYou know, putting that flag out there.\n\n513\n00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,870\nAnd if you think about it it's,\nhow many companies do you know of\n\n514\n00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:58,050\nnowadays that don't even have a physical\nbrick and mortar storefront anymore.\n\n515\n00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,190\nThey just exist in cyberspace.\n\n516\n00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:01,670\nSo this could be a very critical thing.\n\n517\n00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,338\nYou're effectively taking out a business.\n\n518\n00:29:03,338 --> 00:29:04,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's revenue.\n\n519\n00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,860\nStreaming everything by doing that.\n\n520\n00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,430\nAnd it's a very popular target.\n\n521\n00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:13,760\nBut then you look at other reasons for\ntaking out, doing denial of services,\n\n522\n00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,230\nand they had one revolving\naround Wikileaks.\n\n523\n00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,260\nYou know, when Wikileaks' whole thing,\nyou know,\n\n524\n00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:27,580\nbusted open on that case with\neverything with Wikileaks.\n\n525\n00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,470\nVisa, PayPal, and\na few other payment processors,\n\n526\n00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:34,670\nthat took donations, that were allowing\npeople to send donations to Wikileaks,\n\n527\n00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:37,590\nsaid we do not want to be\nassociated with that activity, and\n\n528\n00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,885\nthey shut down down their payment\nprocessing for the, for those you know for\n\n529\n00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:44,835\na few weeks I told people you\ncould not set them up this way.\n\n530\n00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:50,775\nIn retaliation people organized this grass\nroute things called operation payback.\n\n531\n00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:54,245\nWhich is when they did operation\npayback required people\n\n532\n00:29:54,245 --> 00:29:58,325\nto download something called\nthe low orbit ion cannon.\n\n533\n00:29:58,325 --> 00:30:01,005\nThat's the name of it, kid you not.\n\n534\n00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:04,030\nThey, you could download\nthis piece of software.\n\n535\n00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,160\nAnd it's really fascinating\nwhen you saw it.\n\n536\n00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,180\nBecause they found ways to\ndistribute this software.\n\n537\n00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,100\nMake it available to people.\n\n538\n00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,210\nAnd it's really an opt in bot net.\n\n539\n00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,610\nWhich flies counter to the ways\nthat we've talked about already for\n\n540\n00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,340\ncreating a bot net.\n\n541\n00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,210\nAll the stuff we've talked about here for\ncreating a bot net was.\n\n542\n00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,100\nI'm somehow going to make you\nan unwilling participant.\n\n543\n00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,870\nIn this botnet.\n\n544\n00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,390\nNow we're saying here's\nthis operation payback and\n\n545\n00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:37,440\nwe're posting on sites, like\ndiscussion groups and stuff like that.\n\n546\n00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,270\nYou can find which ones pretty easily\nby looking up operation payback, but\n\n547\n00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:47,582\nwhat would happen is you go to these sites\nthey tell you what IP addresses to attack\n\n548\n00:30:47,582 --> 00:30:53,740\nyou would go download\nlow-orbit ion cannon,\n\n549\n00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,300\ndrop the IP address in, and\ntell it to go ahead and fire.\n\n550\n00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:02,560\nAnd it would start sending out\npings on a schedule that you set.\n\n551\n00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,180\nAnd you could ratchet it up or down.\n\n552\n00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,160\nThere were like recommended settings.\n\n553\n00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,190\nAnd you could ratchet it up or down to get\nthe results that you want, end result was,\n\n554\n00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,480\nthat was the Visa and\n\n555\n00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,370\nall those ones with 700 connections,\nthose are the ones that just got crushed.\n\n556\n00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,840\nWhat's really fascinating\nabout that though,\n\n557\n00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,550\nis this is people volunteering\nto be part of a botnet.\n\n558\n00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,130\n>> I was gonna say, you got your-.\n\n559\n00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,510\n>> Your normal botnet's\nlike a draft process.\n\n560\n00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,410\nYou don't have a choice.\n\n561\n00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,310\nI've infected your machine to\nincorporate you in my botnet.\n\n562\n00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,600\nBut then you have the voluntary\narmy as well right?\n\n563\n00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,140\nWhere people can come in and say yeah.\n\n564\n00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,080\nI wanna be a part of your army.\n\n565\n00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,640\n>> Yeah.\nThey just enlisted it and you're going.\n\n566\n00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,940\nAnd that's Interesting thing, and\nit's not unheard of to have that.\n\n567\n00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:48,840\nYou know for the record,\nif you do join a botnet like that,\n\n568\n00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,142\nyou opt into it, if they track it\nback to you as being part of it.\n\n569\n00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:57,970\nYes, you may not be the one in\ncontrol of the whole overall campaign,\n\n570\n00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:00,486\nyou're part of it, you will be prosecuted.\n\n571\n00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,413\nAnd people were prosecuted.\n\n572\n00:32:02,413 --> 00:32:04,213\nFor being part of Operation Payback.\n\n573\n00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:04,898\n>> Really?\n\n574\n00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:05,409\n>> Yeah.\n\n575\n00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:09,160\n>> I can see that, cuz you actually\nvolunteered to take part of this attack.\n\n576\n00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,470\nSo that would assure that\n\n577\n00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,880\nthey're going to hold somebody accountable\n>> Yeah.\n\n578\n00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,530\n>> And they're going to start with the\nfirst ones they find, typically the little\n\n579\n00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:18,500\nman on the totem pole,\nthey're the ones who get caught, right?\n\n580\n00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,710\n>> Yeah, they need to make examples of it,\nand they did.\n\n581\n00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:25,950\nI remember they put somebody in Chicago\nin prison for a couple years for that.\n\n582\n00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:27,490\nThey didn't take it lightly.\n\n583\n00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,040\n>> So webservers are a big target for\nattack for a few reasons.\n\n584\n00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,180\nThe visibility that we have when it\ngoes down, the fact that it's already\n\n585\n00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,020\nout there and easy to find, I don't have\nto break through firewalls to get it,\n\n586\n00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,550\nit's exposed to the Internet,\nmake it for a prime target.\n\n587\n00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,410\nBut it's not the only system the bad\nguys are looking at on my network.\n\n588\n00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,790\n>> No, absolutely not.\n\n589\n00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,000\nThere's so\nmany different resources out there.\n\n590\n00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,045\nIt's just a question of what\nyou want to accomplish.\n\n591\n00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:58,060\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n592\n00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,650\n>> One of the other ones\nyou can go with is DNS.\n\n593\n00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,800\nDNS, you could flood DNS with queries.\n\n594\n00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,630\nYou know, or you could flood\nit with queries, overwhelm it.\n\n595\n00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,692\nYou could poison the cache on DNS and\nservers and systems, so\n\n596\n00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:15,230\npeople will get bogus records.\n\n597\n00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:18,990\nAnd what happens is they will go to\nplaces, bounced up to places where,\n\n598\n00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,630\nyou know, from here to where ever and\n\n599\n00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,140\nback, without going to\nthe resource that they want to.\n\n600\n00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,760\nThose all act as very effective\ndenial of services against that,\n\n601\n00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,310\nor the denial of service campaigns against\nthat particular service, against DNS.\n\n602\n00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,430\nSo, if you attack DNS,\nyou could cause a lot of havoc.\n\n603\n00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,390\nNot to mention that there's\nthings that rely on DNS.\n\n604\n00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:48,870\nWhat if you were able to denial\nof service a system inside a DNS\n\n605\n00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,510\nserver inside a company.\n\n606\n00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,735\nYou're somehow able to\nget that level of access.\n\n607\n00:33:52,735 --> 00:33:53,340\n>> Mm-hmm.\n\n608\n00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,615\n>> And pound on it a bit.\n\n609\n00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,245\nThink about it.\n\n610\n00:33:55,245 --> 00:34:00,645\nYou're, you're in a windows base network\nand you hammer on a, a DNS server.\n\n611\n00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:02,215\nYou know what's gonna happen?\n\n612\n00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:04,745\nYou might be taking\nan active directory with it.\n\n613\n00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:06,385\nYou might be taking an exchange with it.\n\n614\n00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:08,002\nBecause that's the foundation.\n\n615\n00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:10,482\nSo you could have even\nmore far reaching things,\n\n616\n00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,342\nif you could do a denial of\nservice you get something inside.\n\n617\n00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,042\nIt's entirely possible.\n\n618\n00:34:15,042 --> 00:34:18,232\n>> Yeah, it's real scary, cuz I mean\nwe know from our server classes and\n\n619\n00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:20,432\nthings like that how much we rely on DNS.\n\n620\n00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:23,092\nGot Active Directory, just for\nauthentication processes,\n\n621\n00:34:23,092 --> 00:34:24,972\nfor replication processes.\n\n622\n00:34:24,972 --> 00:34:29,712\nIt all relies on DNS, so effectively I'm\nfinding that common link between them,\n\n623\n00:34:29,712 --> 00:34:33,420\nyanking it out, and\nend up DOS-ing A few different services.\n\n624\n00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,300\nI was just looking to see if that old,\nthere used to be a website Zone H that\n\n625\n00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,700\nused to list all those hacked websites.\n\n626\n00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,840\nI'll see if it's still up and running.\n\n627\n00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,480\n>> Oh.\nYeah, yeah.\n\n628\n00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,140\nI know what you're talking about.\n\n629\n00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,178\n>> It would rank the guys.\n\n630\n00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:53,670\nYou could submit an image,\na screenshot of a site you had hacked,\n\n631\n00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:56,390\ngot your logo put on their homepage or\nsomething like that.\n\n632\n00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:57,830\nAnd it would actually rank these guys.\n\n633\n00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,410\nAnd so, there was a big debate about it\nbecause, one, it was good information\n\n634\n00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:06,440\nto see, you know, wait, has my site been\nhacked, or good research information.\n\n635\n00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,850\nBut then a lot of people said, well, wait,\n\n636\n00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,390\naren't you really just making it\na game for the hackers and, you know,\n\n637\n00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,310\nyou're giving them kudos for\nI've got the most hacked sites on there.\n\n638\n00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,360\nBut kind of a cool site, I'll find\nthat link and send it to you guys.\n\n639\n00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,780\n>> Yeah.\nThat is a cool one to look at.\n\n640\n00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,500\nI had the top three spots.\n\n641\n00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,490\nI rocked that thing man.\n\n642\n00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:28,700\nHigh score.\n\n643\n00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,905\nYou guys can have your time pilot.\n\n644\n00:35:30,905 --> 00:35:35,700\n[LAUGH]\n\n645\n00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,940\nSo web servers, DNS servers, what else?\n\n646\n00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,510\nRouters.\n\n647\n00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,660\n>> Oh, routers.\n\n648\n00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,525\nThat's actually a really\ngood one to point.\n\n649\n00:35:47,525 --> 00:35:48,735\nLet's talk about that one.\n\n650\n00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:50,705\nI get excited when I think about that.\n\n651\n00:35:50,705 --> 00:35:51,665\nI was like routers.\n\n652\n00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:53,535\n>> Holy crap, routers.\n\n653\n00:35:53,535 --> 00:35:54,765\nYes.\n>> I was like,\n\n654\n00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:57,098\nyou know, like hulking up, man.\n\n655\n00:35:57,098 --> 00:35:57,843\nCool, right?\n\n656\n00:35:57,843 --> 00:36:00,080\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you like routers?\n\n657\n00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,594\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n658\n00:36:00,594 --> 00:36:01,311\n>> I love 'em. I'm a fan.\n\n659\n00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:04,770\nI got pictures on the wall.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n660\n00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,990\n>> Well, what makes them so excitable?\n\n661\n00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,080\n>> This is actually,\nthis is something that's actually really\n\n662\n00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,050\nfascinating about them,\nbecause we mentioned it in the intro but\n\n663\n00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:21,310\nwe haven't got to see it yet,\nwhat about permanent denial of services?\n\n664\n00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,510\nRouters, switches,\nmany of these hardware devices,\n\n665\n00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,470\nthey do allow flash updates to them.\n\n666\n00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,340\n>> Yeah, I was gonna say,\nyou could take a hammer to them, but\n\n667\n00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,810\nthere's other ways that I might\nnot have to physical be there.\n\n668\n00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,210\n>> Yeah, a little more elegant way.\n\n669\n00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,792\nBut not as dramatic or cool.\n\n670\n00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,240\n>> That's true.\nTrue, that is true.\n\n671\n00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,739\n>> I prefer lighten 'em on fire.\n\n672\n00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,650\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, a little lighter fluid,\n\n673\n00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,710\na little marshmallow on a stick,\nnow we're talkin'.\n\n674\n00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,375\n>> Yeah, come on.\n\n675\n00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:49,310\n>> [LAUGH] But yeah, as you're saying,\nwe might be able phlash them, right?\n\n676\n00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:54,540\n>> Yeah, there actually is an attack\ncalled phlashing, P-H, and then the rest\n\n677\n00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,940\nof the word, that you actually\nsend something to a device and\n\n678\n00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,820\ntell it to do a flash update or\ncorrupt something in the actual\n\n679\n00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,880\nBIOS of the system and cause it to\nbasically to be bricked at that point,\n\n680\n00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,210\na slang term meaning that it's dead.\n\n681\n00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:22,970\nAt the very least, it's a long term\nIt's a long-term denial of service.\n\n682\n00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,030\nAnd it may, in some cases, be permanent.\n\n683\n00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:29,170\nIt depends on the age of the router or\ndevice.\n\n684\n00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:32,420\nAnd, safety mechanisms they put in place.\n\n685\n00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,830\nBut I can blast a router, you know\nwhat have you, and if it's vulnerable,\n\n686\n00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,890\ncause it to do this update,\nthis bogus update, and get corrupted.\n\n687\n00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,790\nIt's not gonna work.\n\n688\n00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,040\nIt's dead.\n\n689\n00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,460\nIt becomes a brick, it's a paperweight.\n\n690\n00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,030\nSo you have to go in and\n\n691\n00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,860\neither see if you can reset it manually\nand then reconfigure everything.\n\n692\n00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,590\nWhich is gonna take you some time.\n\n693\n00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,260\nSo it's gonna be a long term outage.\n\n694\n00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:03,980\nBut yeah, if you go back far enough and\nI just pound on your system\n\n695\n00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,060\nwith a flash denial of service, it's dead.\n\n696\n00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,490\nIt's dead, you'll have to replace.\n\n697\n00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,890\n>> We've probably all done some\nof that accidentally to our own,\n\n698\n00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,060\nputting that new DDWRT on our\nlittle Linksys router or something.\n\n699\n00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,700\nAnd goof it up.\n\n700\n00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,730\nBut it's the same principal, right?\n\n701\n00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,980\nYou're flashing that router\nwith a new set of instructions.\n\n702\n00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,270\nAnd if the instructions are no good,\nthe router can't do it or\n\n703\n00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,110\ndo what it's suppose to do.\n\n704\n00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,150\nAnd you better have a backup router\nsitting around otherwise it's like\n\n705\n00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:30,740\nwhat you said.\n\n706\n00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,980\nIt's going to be a little while before\nI can get that thing back up and\n\n707\n00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,310\nrunning, if ever.\n\n708\n00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,890\n>> Yeah.\n>> If ever.\n\n709\n00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,790\n>> And keep in mind you can\ndo it with computers as well.\n\n710\n00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,120\nI mean, computers do have\nthat flash update ability, so\n\n711\n00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,640\nyou could go through and\nkill one of those.\n\n712\n00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,490\nAt least on the computer,\nif it comes down to it,\n\n713\n00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:50,670\nyou could run down to your local\ncomputer shop and rip the hardware out,\n\n714\n00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,400\nrip the hard drive out and drop it\ninto that one, just plop it right in.\n\n715\n00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,230\nBut It's still, it's a bit of a pain.\n\n716\n00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,300\nSo it's highly possible that someone could\n\n717\n00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,720\ndo this to a system if\nit's of a certain age.\n\n718\n00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,010\nAnd it's gonna be frustrating.\n\n719\n00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,070\nIt is gonna be definitely frustrating\nto you when that actually occurs.\n\n720\n00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,799\n>> All right, so we got our web servers,\nour DNS servers, our routers.\n\n721\n00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:20,170\nWhat else?\n\n722\n00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:22,310\nWhat about what those web servers talk to?\n\n723\n00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:26,680\nTypically all my data doesn't\nreside on that web server, right?\n\n724\n00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,100\n>> Yeah, you're absolutely right because\nwe do not have systems nowadays that are,\n\n725\n00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:37,370\nwell we do have systems nowadays, that\nare just one tier, just that web server.\n\n726\n00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:42,830\nBut it's not uncommon, in fact it's very\ncommon to see those multi tier systems,\n\n727\n00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,110\nwhere you have a web server\nas the front end, and\n\n728\n00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,430\nthen have some middle section\nwhere business logic is.\n\n729\n00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,400\n>> Applications there.\n\n730\n00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,681\n>> And then a back end where the database\nand all that stuff might be.\n\n731\n00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,652\n>> All you gotta do is knock down one of\nthose, you know, one of those dominoes, so\n\n732\n00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:59,261\nto speak, and, or\nknock down links between them and\n\n733\n00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,304\nyou're going to kill the whole system.\n\n734\n00:40:01,304 --> 00:40:05,656\nIt's gonna be dead, so that's something\nelse when you're building a complex system\n\n735\n00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:09,630\nlike that, you really need to think\nabout the availability aspect of it.\n\n736\n00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,546\nWhen you're diagramming out\nhow everything fits together,\n\n737\n00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:16,256\nyou shouldn't have anything where a bunch\nof lines converge all on one point.\n\n738\n00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:19,660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's where someone's gonna go and\n\n739\n00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,460\njust punch it, and your dead right there.\n\n740\n00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,130\n>> Yeah, we've heard that term,\nsingle point of failure, right?\n\n741\n00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,840\nAnd we want to avoid\nthose things at all cost.\n\n742\n00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,920\nAs an attacker, I wanna find those.\n\n743\n00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,760\nI'm looking for\nyour single points of failure.\n\n744\n00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,720\nCuz that means I can take out one\nthing and compromise several.\n\n745\n00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,930\nSo, that's what the bad\nguys are looking for.\n\n746\n00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,078\n>> Absolutely.\n\n747\n00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:39,681\n>> All right.\n\n748\n00:40:39,681 --> 00:40:42,513\nWe'll tell you what, ladies and gentlemen,\nlooking at our clocks, it's about time for\n\n749\n00:40:42,513 --> 00:40:44,168\nus to take another one of\nthose pesky little breaks.\n\n750\n00:40:44,168 --> 00:40:45,501\nSo, we're gonna step away and\n\n751\n00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:48,794\nwhen we come back we're gonna continue\non with some more denial of service.\n\n752\n00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,290\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n753\n00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,043\nWe'll be right back.\n\n754\n00:40:51,043 --> 00:40:57,668\n[SOUND].\n\n755\n00:40:57,668 --> 00:40:59,770\nAll right, welcome back,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n756\n00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,020\nContinuing on with our\ndenial of service episode.\n\n757\n00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,840\nNext thing we wanna take a look at or\ntalk about it and\n\n758\n00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,700\nactually look at, is being able to\nrecognize maybe some of these different\n\n759\n00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,440\ntypes of denial of service attacks.\n\n760\n00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,190\nAnd actually define some of these\ndifferent denial service attackS\n\n761\n00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,550\nthat you might try to perform or\nyou might see out there.\n\n762\n00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,470\n>> Yeah.\nthat's the next step we gotta do.\n\n763\n00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,660\nWe got to find some additional\nattack types and what they mean.\n\n764\n00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:29,001\nWhat different initial\nthings we can do with a DOS.\n\n765\n00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:33,760\nCuz we do have, you know, quite a few\ndifferent ways a DOS can take place.\n\n766\n00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,876\nThey can take place, like I said,\nmaliciously, accidentally.\n\n767\n00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:42,940\nThey could be launched against you\nby a third party, has no idea.\n\n768\n00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,070\nThat's happening.\n\n769\n00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:51,320\nIn fact, one of them that we can take a\nlook at is when we're talking about worms.\n\n770\n00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,180\nWorms can actually do it.\n\n771\n00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:59,830\nWe remember from earlier on in\nthe lessons we've talked about so far.\n\n772\n00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:05,030\nWe did talk about malware, we talked about\nviruses, worms, Trojans, and all that.\n\n773\n00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:09,311\nOf the malware, we talked about the one\nthat has most likely to cause you grief as\n\n774\n00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:12,670\na denial of service, is a worm.\n\n775\n00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:17,810\nAnd what I have here,\nyou know, on my screen here is\n\n776\n00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:24,960\nI have an example of Wireshark that\nshows an example of a Slammer worm.\n\n777\n00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,210\nThis is a sample pcap file.\n\n778\n00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:33,127\nThese are the type of things\nthat I was telling you about,\n\n779\n00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:36,730\nis that you can see in here\nwe have Slammer in action.\n\n780\n00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,640\nThis is a snippet of a larger pcap file.\n\n781\n00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,410\nIf you take a look at it,\nyou know, what do we have?\n\n782\n00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:48,320\nYou can see that the second row all the\nway through the bottom, you can see it's\n\n783\n00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,350\ncoming from a certain source to a single\ndestination using the UDP protocol.\n\n784\n00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,950\nThat more than likely means that we have\nsomething like a distributed denial of\n\n785\n00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,682\nservice type situation, where the worm\nis replicating in from various sources.\n\n786\n00:43:01,682 --> 00:43:02,542\nYou know, so,\n\n787\n00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:07,126\nwe have all these things coming in to the\nsame destination using the UDP protocol.\n\n788\n00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:11,350\nAnd if you look all the way\nat the end of each line, so\n\n789\n00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:17,170\nif you go all the way down to the right,\nyou'll see the port 1434.\n\n790\n00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:24,293\nWhich, if you aren't readily aware of that\none, that's associated with SQL Server.\n\n791\n00:43:24,293 --> 00:43:27,463\nSo, if you're a SQL server person,\nyou may recognize that port, and\n\n792\n00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:28,720\nthat's what Slammer did.\n\n793\n00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,270\nSlammer went after SQL Server and\n\n794\n00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:37,765\njust beat up on it, and\nalso used it as a way to replicate.\n\n795\n00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:43,168\nSo, here, what we're seeing is\nSlammer actually in action doing that.\n\n796\n00:43:43,168 --> 00:43:47,354\n>> Yeah, we have dealt with a Slammer\na couple of times and it just generates so\n\n797\n00:43:47,354 --> 00:43:48,645\nmuch traffic.\n\n798\n00:43:48,645 --> 00:43:51,795\nYou know, not only is it working on\nbringing down my SQL server and making it\n\n799\n00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,295\nso busy, you know, that it's doing\na denial of service on the SQL server.\n\n800\n00:43:55,295 --> 00:43:58,570\nIt really ended up doing a denial\nof service on my entire network\n\n801\n00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,330\nbecause all the other hosts on\nthat network got infected, and\n\n802\n00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,300\nthey all started replicating this worm.\n\n803\n00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,290\nEverything shut down.\n\n804\n00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,000\nI mean,\nour bandwidth just bottomed out, and\n\n805\n00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,695\nnobody could get into legitimate\ntraffic to go across the network.\n\n806\n00:44:11,695 --> 00:44:13,955\nSo, you had to start killing machines and\ncleaning them and\n\n807\n00:44:13,955 --> 00:44:17,825\nputting them back on the network\none by one, to clean all that up.\n\n808\n00:44:17,825 --> 00:44:18,765\nIt was a real mess.\n\n809\n00:44:18,765 --> 00:44:21,045\n>> Yeah, it's a nasty proposition at best.\n\n810\n00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:28,165\nThese things can just start chewing up\nresources really, really, really quickly.\n\n811\n00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:34,410\nAnd I'll show you another type of\nattack here I loaded into Wireshark.\n\n812\n00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:40,020\nIt shows you a variation of\nsomething that we had talked about.\n\n813\n00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,910\nKind of sort of,this is\nwhat's called a SYN flood.\n\n814\n00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:47,040\nThis is denial service attack.\n\n815\n00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,550\nThe way it works is what we do is that,\nand\n\n816\n00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,860\nyou should be able to\nkinda see what's going on,\n\n817\n00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:58,830\nis I have a bunch of source addresses\nfired towards the same destination.\n\n818\n00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,850\nIf you look in the info column over there,\n\n819\n00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:05,700\nyou can see that we're firing\nat a bunch of SYN requests.\n\n820\n00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,600\nSo, it's happening when we\nfire up the SYN requests.\n\n821\n00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,330\nThe reason why you're not seeing\nany SYN ACKs come back in, or\n\n822\n00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:16,400\nany ACKs is because of\nthe way a SYN flood works.\n\n823\n00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,300\nWhen we send that packet out,\nwe spoof the source address on it.\n\n824\n00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,810\nWe spoof it to an address that we\nknow is essentially a black hole.\n\n825\n00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,655\nSo, what happens is,\nis that I keep sending send requests out,\n\n826\n00:45:31,655 --> 00:45:36,876\nit goes to the target, the target\nresponds to that SYN with a SYN ACK.\n\n827\n00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:39,876\nBut because the source\naddress that it got, and\n\n828\n00:45:39,876 --> 00:45:45,100\nit's supposed to be replying to, is\nactually a bogus address or a black hole.\n\n829\n00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,580\nIt's not coming back to this station.\n\n830\n00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,210\nIt's going someplace else.\n\n831\n00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,100\nAnd what happens is, it drops in there.\n\n832\n00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:53,340\nBut the system has to wait a certain\nperiod of time before it can\n\n833\n00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:55,580\nidle out that connection, and time it out.\n\n834\n00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:00,550\nSo, I'm gonna open up as many connections\nas I can until they're all done.\n\n835\n00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,180\n>> Yeah.\n>> At some point, they'll time out, but\n\n836\n00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,160\nI'll just shove another send in there.\n\n837\n00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,300\nAnd suck it up really quick.\n\n838\n00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,190\n>> Yeah,\ntypically your servers only have so\n\n839\n00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,420\nmuch memory dedicated to holding\nthat half-open connection, right?\n\n840\n00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:16,200\nThey're waiting for that final\nacknowledgement to complete that three-way\n\n841\n00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,240\nhandshake that we get with TCP.\n\n842\n00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,550\nSo, they can store these, but\nthey've run out of memory.\n\n843\n00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,930\nThey don't have enough\nspace to hold any more.\n\n844\n00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,630\nAnd they can no longer accept\nany new connections until one or\n\n845\n00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,890\ntwo of them times out, but if I keep\nsending them and keep sending them,\n\n846\n00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:35,440\nit just keeps that buffer full and\nit can't accept any new connections.\n\n847\n00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,830\nA couple ways we could defend,\n\n848\n00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:42,470\nI mean you can increase how much resources\nit has to hold those connections open.\n\n849\n00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,190\nYou could shorten how long it maintains or\nwaits for that final acknowledgement.\n\n850\n00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,872\nI think a lot of the routers nowadays will\nactually pay attention to this too and so,\n\n851\n00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:52,766\nif they see that connection come through,\n\n852\n00:46:52,766 --> 00:46:55,625\nthey'll actually send\nan acknowledgement back to the target.\n\n853\n00:46:55,625 --> 00:46:59,654\nAnd then, if you're a legitimate host and\nyou finally do send your acknowledgement\n\n854\n00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:02,990\nin, the second acknowledgement is\nnot gonna hurt that connection.\n\n855\n00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,430\nSo, a few different ways that\nit can kind of be dealt with.\n\n856\n00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,080\nBut still, a very powerful attack.\n\n857\n00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,500\n>> Yes, it's still worth, so\nvery, very, very effective.\n\n858\n00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:19,730\nSo, if you have a system, it is vulnerable\nto it because this behavior has to happen.\n\n859\n00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:23,402\nSo, you know, and like Mike was saying,\nthere are some adjustments you can do.\n\n860\n00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:29,140\nYou can increase the number\nof available connections,\n\n861\n00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,360\nyou can decrease the timeout time on that.\n\n862\n00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,020\nYeah, you could do potential load\nbalancing in there, distribute it.\n\n863\n00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,710\nI mean, so,\nthere's some things you can do, but,\n\n864\n00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,235\nif someone's really determined,\nthey can at least slow you down.\n\n865\n00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:45,400\n>> Absolutely,\nthose adjustments might help, but if it's\n\n866\n00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,400\na distributed denial of service attack,\nwith 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 hosts, [LAUGH]\n\n867\n00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:54,970\nno amount of memory is going to be able\nto hold all those half-open connections,\n\n868\n00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:58,353\nand you're gonna end up getting a DOS\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n869\n00:47:58,353 --> 00:48:04,381\nAbsolutely, at some point,\nget something like that.\n\n870\n00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:08,403\nSome other tags, some other denouncers and\ntags involve my favorite,\n\n871\n00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:11,080\nthe gold ICM packets that we can use,\nright?\n\n872\n00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,860\nThere's several different types of\nattacks we can do with those guys.\n\n873\n00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:18,780\n>> Yes.\nThey're plenty of ones you can do.\n\n874\n00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:22,430\nYou can fire off a bunch of those and\njust flood a system with just pings.\n\n875\n00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:23,310\nIt's possible to do that.\n\n876\n00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,340\nAnd, in fact,\nthat's what Orbit Ion Cannon did.\n\n877\n00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,370\nYou can also, with those packets,\nsometimes craft them in weird ways so\n\n878\n00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:32,090\nthe system doesn't know\nhow to respond to it.\n\n879\n00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:35,750\nI think that's actually one of the big\nones in there is how it's crafting\n\n880\n00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:38,440\npackets, for the fragmenting them and\nstuff like that.\n\n881\n00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,540\nThat's where it can get\nreally interesting.\n\n882\n00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,550\nis paying in other packets\ncan be fragmented.\n\n883\n00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:49,190\nAnd what you can do is, the way we know it\nfrag means is chop it into little pieces\n\n884\n00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,160\nso it can traverse a network.\n\n885\n00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,690\nWell, we can play with that, you know we\nhave ways of doing, for example, what they\n\n886\n00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:01,785\ncall a pod attack or a ping of death,\nwhich is what they'll do Is,\n\n887\n00:49:01,785 --> 00:49:07,480\nwe will take a packet and\n\n888\n00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:11,840\nwe will make it way\nover it's maximum size.\n\n889\n00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,670\nAnd what will happen is, is that\nwhen it goes over that maximum size,\n\n890\n00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,380\nit'll hit the network and get fragmented.\n\n891\n00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,660\nBut then what happens is it gets\nto its final destination and\n\n892\n00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:25,040\nit resembles it, and\nit just can't handle it.\n\n893\n00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,100\nThe system has to do\nsomething in response.\n\n894\n00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:35,280\nAnd in some cases that system\nmay simply just discard it.\n\n895\n00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,870\nBut in other cases it will crash,\n\n896\n00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:42,170\nit will literally go through and\ncrash the system out.\n\n897\n00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,620\nSo it all really depends.\n\n898\n00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:48,030\nModern systems will just ignore it,\nyou know, when they see a ping of death.\n\n899\n00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,970\nBut there are still some systems out\nthere that will basically choke on it.\n\n900\n00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:55,280\nThe last Windows systems I can remember\nbeing really vulnerable to that was\n\n901\n00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,160\nWas NT4.\n\n902\n00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,550\nSo it's been a while, but it's still\n\n903\n00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:06,420\npossible you might run into systems\nthat are gonna have that sort of issue.\n\n904\n00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,190\n>> Yeah, one I know I've seen called out.\n\n905\n00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,240\nSo make sure, I see a lot of people\nrefer to the ping of death as just\n\n906\n00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,110\nsending a whole bunch of\nping packets at that target.\n\n907\n00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,620\nLet's make sure we recognize\nthe difference, right?\n\n908\n00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,020\nThe ICMP flood or\n\n909\n00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:21,270\nthe ping flood is when you're doing\nmultiple ping packets to that target.\n\n910\n00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,940\nTrying to overwhelm it with\njust the sheer number.\n\n911\n00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,530\nThe ping of death is when we actually\nbreak that packet up into fragments.\n\n912\n00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,670\nAnd we do it in a way.\n\n913\n00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,310\nWe craft it ourselves.\n\n914\n00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,510\nSo that it starts out larger than\nthe original allowable size by\n\n915\n00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:37,640\nwhat the protocol states,\nchop it up into little pieces,\n\n916\n00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:40,960\nnobody realizes that there's too many\npieces till it gets to the destination,\n\n917\n00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,850\nit tries to put them all back together,\nand all of a sudden he says wait,\n\n918\n00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,660\nthis violates the rules of the protocol,\nwhat am I supposed to do with this?\n\n919\n00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:48,500\nAnd he ends up hanging up or freezing or\n\n920\n00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:52,910\nthat's the idea but as you said a lot\nof this has been patched against.\n\n921\n00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:55,200\n>> Yeah so\ndon't count on it necessarily working.\n\n922\n00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,860\nBy the way the way you\ncraft packets like that\n\n923\n00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,430\nis you can use something\nlike H ping two or three.\n\n924\n00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,140\nThere's colasofts packet generator or\npacket crafter.\n\n925\n00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,130\nThere's a lot of packet\ncrafters out there.\n\n926\n00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:15,720\nI'll leave it to you to go\nfind the appropriate ways and\n\n927\n00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,470\nswitches to do it in each one.\n\n928\n00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:19,210\nBut they are out there.\n\n929\n00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:21,410\nFYI, you know?\n\n930\n00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,750\nIf you got the book, the switches for\nh ping two and three are in there.\n\n931\n00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:31,080\nThose will be on the test potentially but\nthey're also very useful for\n\n932\n00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,910\nthe field because you can use up a h ping\nto create your packet to test things and\n\n933\n00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:40,230\nit's particularly useful for\nthat and not just a ping of death.\n\n934\n00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,600\nI love the name ping of death.\n\n935\n00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,660\n>> I do, sounds great.\n\n936\n00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,520\n>> Ping of death net\nto your wrestle mania.\n\n937\n00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,625\nHulk mania's not running wild.\n\n938\n00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,783\n[LAUGH].\n\n939\n00:51:48,783 --> 00:51:50,710\nI love that.\n\n940\n00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,400\n>> It is a great thing.\n\n941\n00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,260\nAnother one would be the tear drop attack,\n\n942\n00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,340\nanother fragmentation type of attack\nwhere they take those packer.\n\n943\n00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,300\nWhen we fragment it up we gotta tell the\nother end how to put them back together.\n\n944\n00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:04,830\nSo we got those sequence numbers in there.\n\n945\n00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,210\nWe got those offsets which really tell it.\n\n946\n00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:11,000\nWhere this packet goes in the puzzle\nto piece it back together.\n\n947\n00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,550\nWell what if the end of one packet has an\noffset that's greater than the beginning\n\n948\n00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,660\nof the next packet.\n\n949\n00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,300\nOr the next fragment, I should say.\n\n950\n00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:21,420\nSo when you try to put it back together,\nthey start overlapping.\n\n951\n00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,390\nAnd that's what we did\nwith that teardrop attack.\n\n952\n00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,060\nIt's just, again,\n\n953\n00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,520\nmalformed packets that we can create and\nviolate the rules of the protocol and\n\n954\n00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,880\nthe other end has to figure out what to do\nand a lot of times that's just a crash.\n\n955\n00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,200\n>> Yes, and that's the thing,\nyou eluded to it with the ping of death,\n\n956\n00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,050\nthat there's certain rules.\n\n957\n00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,280\nFor the protocols that must be followed.\n\n958\n00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,620\nAnd if those rules aren't followed,\n\n959\n00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:48,760\nthen it kind of falls in that grey\narea of how do I deal with that?\n\n960\n00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:51,130\nNow, modern systems are probably\ngoing to discard packets.\n\n961\n00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:54,030\nA teardrop type attack.\n\n962\n00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:55,800\nBut if they don't.\n\n963\n00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,820\nYou know what happens.\n\n964\n00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,910\nLike I said, it could be a hang.\n\n965\n00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,740\nIt could be a blue screen of death.\n\n966\n00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:03,390\nIt could be an out and out crash.\n\n967\n00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,550\nMore than likely it's\nnot gonna be a problem.\n\n968\n00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:13,110\nIn fact, you know some of your devices,\nyour border devices that come in before\n\n969\n00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:18,580\nthose systems would see that and just say\nthis is invalid and get rid of it anyway.\n\n970\n00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:24,460\nSo, it is something that is potentially,\nthat is potentially a problem,\n\n971\n00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:31,090\nI think, actually, for\nboth Ping of Death and Teardrop.\n\n972\n00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:34,840\nI believe this is the prior service\npack 1 is vulnerable to this.\n\n973\n00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,380\n>> Oh is it.\n\n974\n00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,194\n>> Yeah, because they had re-written\n>> [CROSSTALK] Yeah.\n\n975\n00:53:39,194 --> 00:53:43,770\nthey had actually reintroduced some\nof these problems back into it.\n\n976\n00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:45,035\n>> I can see that.\n\n977\n00:53:45,035 --> 00:53:47,990\nCause remember it was completely\nrewritten starting with Vista and later.\n\n978\n00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:53,360\nWith XP starter packet three they kind of\nshoved IPV6 in there with Vista and later.\n\n979\n00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,602\nSo server 2008.\n\n980\n00:53:55,602 --> 00:54:00,000\n>> And later, they rewrote that TCPIP\nstack, so you had IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n981\n00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,300\n>> And to make it 64 bit, too, they\nhad to a lot of re-architecting of it.\n\n982\n00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,650\n>> It always me how,\n\n983\n00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,720\nin my mind, sometimes, I'm like\n>> Wait a second you guys had this\n\n984\n00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:15,340\nproblem, you patched it,\nnow you're introducing this new thing and\n\n985\n00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,870\nit's vulnerable to the same stuff\nthat we were vulnerable to before.\n\n986\n00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,220\nHow is that possible?\n\n987\n00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,040\nI like with operating systems you see\nthis you'll see that a later operating\n\n988\n00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:28,590\nsystem requires the same patch that\na previous operating system needed.\n\n989\n00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:32,220\nAnd it's because they start the\ndevelopment of some of this stuff before\n\n990\n00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,670\nthe other one's even just been released,\nor something like that.\n\n991\n00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,130\nSo some of those\nvulnerabilities carry over.\n\n992\n00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:39,750\nWhich is why sometimes these\nattacks might still work,\n\n993\n00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:44,340\neven though they've been known and\nthey should have been patched against.\n\n994\n00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,250\n>> Absolutely.\nIn fact that was actually You bring\n\n995\n00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,500\nup a perfect conversation.\n\n996\n00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:53,380\nCause that conversation was had and like\nwhat the heck, you had everything solved,\n\n997\n00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,470\nand then you broke it?\n\n998\n00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:59,090\nYou know, it was that since it came out.\n\n999\n00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:05,310\nIf memory serves, the IP protocol stack\nthat was from XP service pack three,\n\n1000\n00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:09,220\nwent all the way back to like NT for\ndays, somewhere there.\n\n1001\n00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,130\nIt had been around for that long.\n\n1002\n00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:15,330\nAnd it just evolved, so,\nwhen you've had a component around for\n\n1003\n00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:18,570\nthat long, they've pounded the heck\nout of it for those many years.\n\n1004\n00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,710\nThat's a good number of\nyears that's been around.\n\n1005\n00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,540\nYou're talking more than a decade\nthat's been in the works.\n\n1006\n00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,310\nSo it's had time to get those things.\n\n1007\n00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,560\nYou know ironed out of it, and kind of\nbeen put through it's paces so all these\n\n1008\n00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:33,800\nlittle things that were happening when it\nwas first introduced are no longer there.\n\n1009\n00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,240\nBut what happens when you re-architect\nthings from the ground up,\n\n1010\n00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,960\nyou're gonna have growing pains.\n\n1011\n00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,090\nSo, and they had growing pains with Vista.\n\n1012\n00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,516\nThere were some things with Vista\nwhen it first came out that.\n\n1013\n00:55:45,516 --> 00:55:49,752\nAnd I know Vista's is much belied,\nbut this, for good or\n\n1014\n00:55:49,752 --> 00:55:54,520\nbad, the protocol stack was one\nof the things that deserved it,\n\n1015\n00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:00,014\nbecause there was a lot of things that\nthey had fixed in the prior version.\n\n1016\n00:56:00,014 --> 00:56:03,505\nThat they should've known to not even\nbuild in, in the new version, but\n\n1017\n00:56:03,505 --> 00:56:04,830\nthey got build it.\n\n1018\n00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,240\nBut then they quickly, with service\npack one, fixed a lot of things, so\n\n1019\n00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,410\nthe holes got closed.\n\n1020\n00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,621\n>> Some other ones we\nshould maybe mention,\n\n1021\n00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:14,745\nI don't know if you're\ngonna see them on the exam.\n\n1022\n00:56:14,745 --> 00:56:17,815\nSmurf, Fraggle,\ndo you want to go into those guys, or.\n\n1023\n00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:21,345\n>> Yeah, you will see Smurf and\nFraggle attacks.\n\n1024\n00:56:21,345 --> 00:56:25,965\nThese are just other ways of\ndoing a denial of service\n\n1025\n00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,395\nby beating up on a system.\n\n1026\n00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:32,243\nThe difference is as far\nas denial of service goes,\n\n1027\n00:56:32,243 --> 00:56:35,980\na Smurf uses TCP and a Fraggle uses UDP.\n\n1028\n00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:40,952\n>> Yeah, just all we're doing\nbasically is pinging the broadcast\n\n1029\n00:56:40,952 --> 00:56:45,210\naddress with a forged or\nspoofed source address.\n\n1030\n00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:50,040\nSo if I take my target's IP address,\nand I make a packet, and use his IP.\n\n1031\n00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,530\nThe target's IP address as the source and\n\n1032\n00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:55,020\nthen ping the broadcast\naddress of my network.\n\n1033\n00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,000\nAnd that goes out to all the nodes on\nthat network who all then reply at, but\n\n1034\n00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,160\nnot to me, to the target,\nthe one I spoof a source address from.\n\n1035\n00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,530\nTCP would be my Smurf and\nthen UDP was my Fraggle.\n\n1036\n00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,845\nSo ping, it's a wonderful thing.\n\n1037\n00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:11,430\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's which,\n\n1038\n00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:14,660\nby the way that broadcast address, or\n\n1039\n00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:19,020\nthe ability to do this has actually been\nshut off for a good number of networks.\n\n1040\n00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:26,880\nSo it's very, very tough to pull off,\nbut you might be able to find it.\n\n1041\n00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,550\nSo it's very effective.\n\n1042\n00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:34,330\nI mean, you can imagine if Mike's\nover here as the target, and\n\n1043\n00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:39,900\nI want to attack him, what I can do\nis I can create a packet for me, and\n\n1044\n00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:45,690\nthere's a network in between us and I can\nping that networks broadcast address, but\n\n1045\n00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:50,370\nI give them Mike's address as\nthe person to respond back to.\n\n1046\n00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:52,130\nSo every client in that network-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1047\n00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,020\n>> Processes that\n\n1048\n00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,080\nping since it went to\nthe broadcast address.\n\n1049\n00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:00,770\nIf there's 200 people on there,\nand I hit the broadcast address,\n\n1050\n00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:04,800\n200 people are seeing that ping, and now\n200 people are responding to a ping over\n\n1051\n00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:09,470\nto Mike, and if I do that often enough,\njust one ping results in that\n\n1052\n00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:14,040\nmassive torrent of traffic to the other\nside, I can cause him to have a bad day.\n\n1053\n00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,610\nI might not crush him, but\nI could cause him to have a bad Bad day.\n\n1054\n00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,700\n>> Yeah, depending on the band\nwidth I have on my network adapter,\n\n1055\n00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,265\nI'm gonna be like why is my network so\nslow.\n\n1056\n00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:25,100\nCuz every freaking device on the network\nis responding to me, you know,\n\n1057\n00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:27,340\nwith all these responses to\nping packets that I never sent.\n\n1058\n00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:28,660\nSo.\n\n1059\n00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:31,200\n>> Yeah, it can be a pretty nasty.\n\n1060\n00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,700\nLike I said, they shut it down\nin most of the newer routers.\n\n1061\n00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,740\nYou have to actually open that or\n\n1062\n00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:40,580\nactivate that functionality\nto allow this to happen, so.\n\n1063\n00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:43,270\n>> They always take away the fun stuff.\n\n1064\n00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,200\n[LAUGH]\n>> And for the record,\n\n1065\n00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,915\nI think Smurf Attack is a good name for\na movie.\n\n1066\n00:58:46,915 --> 00:58:48,830\n>> [LAUGH] That would be good, yeah.\n\n1067\n00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,410\nAll right.\n\n1068\n00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:51,656\n>> Now playing Smurf Attack.\n\n1069\n00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:54,309\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [NOISE]\n\n1070\n00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:55,049\n>> You gotta do it with that\n\n1071\n00:58:55,049

edge!\n\n1074\n00:59:00,772 --> 00:59:03,861\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nice.\n\n1075\n00:59:03,861 --> 00:59:08,768\n>> All right, lets see, I was trying to\nthink of some other DOS's we need to talk\n\n1076\n00:59:08,768 --> 00:59:10,654\nabout,\n>> DHCP.\n\n1077\n00:59:10,654 --> 00:59:11,910\n>> DHCP.\n>> We haven't talked about that one yet.\n\n1078\n00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,270\n>> Yeah, we haven't, lets talk about that.\n\n1079\n00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:18,510\n>> Yeah, DHCP starvation\nattack is what they call it.\n\n1080\n00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:23,930\nIs actually a really neat one because what\nyou're doing is, we know what DHCP does.\n\n1081\n00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:27,880\nAnd we're gonna assume that you've\na pretty good working knowledge of that.\n\n1082\n00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,270\nWhat I can do with the DHCP\nstarvation attack is, I know\n\n1083\n00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:39,270\nthat there's scopes in there that have\nall these IP addresses available in it.\n\n1084\n00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:43,220\nAnd I know people can make\na discover request, and\n\n1085\n00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:48,810\ngo out and start the process\nof leasing an IP address.\n\n1086\n00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:51,820\nWell, the thing is with\nthe DHCP starvation attack is I\n\n1087\n00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,200\nblast out a bunch of requests\nto the DHCP server and\n\n1088\n00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,490\nstart leasing all of the IP\naddresses that are available.\n\n1089\n01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,170\nSo just every last one.\n\n1090\n01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,470\nOnce I chew all those up,\nnow what happens when no one else can,\n\n1091\n01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,210\nwhen there's no more\nIP addresses to lease.\n\n1092\n01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,320\nYou can't get on your network.\n\n1093\n01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,540\n>> Right, all of a sudden I've got users,\ntheir tablets aren't connecting, heck,\n\n1094\n01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,390\nmaybe even their nodes aren't\nconnecting if they've been off.\n\n1095\n01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:20,280\nAnd when it boots it back up,\nit needs to go get an IP address and\n\n1096\n01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,950\nthe DHCP server says,\nsorry, I'm out, right?\n\n1097\n01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:27,230\nIn a Windows environment we're\ngonna get a good old APIPA address,\n\n1098\n01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,060\nwhich isn't gonna get us too far.\n\n1099\n01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:33,660\nSo very, and relatively easy to do,\nbecause DHCP is so unsecure.\n\n1100\n01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,990\n>> Yeah, there's not much in the way\nof security measures there, and\n\n1101\n01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:39,530\nthere's tools built specifically you know,\nto take advantage of this.\n\n1102\n01:00:39,530 --> 01:00:43,790\nThere's one on the market called\nGobbler I mentioned a couple of days ago.\n\n1103\n01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:47,030\nIt does exactly what we're talking about.\n\n1104\n01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:52,100\nIt goes out and blasts a bunch of requests\nout and chews up all the IP addresses.\n\n1105\n01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,542\nNow that means that you've\ngot a couple of options.\n\n1106\n01:00:54,542 --> 01:00:59,060\nEither you have to go into DHCP and\nmanual release all those things or\n\n1107\n01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,920\nyou just wait till they time out.\n\n1108\n01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,590\nOne's tedious,\nthe other one is impractical.\n\n1109\n01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,320\n>> Yeah.\nBy default,\n\n1110\n01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,970\nwe're getting eight day leases\nin a Windows environment so\n\n1111\n01:01:08,970 --> 01:01:13,620\nyou can't really go that long without\nIP address for the rest of your nodes.\n\n1112\n01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,530\nAnd like I said,\nthat's what DHCP is designed to do.\n\n1113\n01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:18,540\nIt listens for a discover and\nit throws out an offer.\n\n1114\n01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:21,080\nSo it's not like I can tell\nit to stop doing that.\n\n1115\n01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,720\nAnd I can't really say only\nauthorized computers because\n\n1116\n01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:27,510\nthere's no way to identify that node yet.\n\n1117\n01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,680\nIt hasn't got an IP address.\n\n1118\n01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:31,560\nIt can't really communicate\nas a Unicast yet, so\n\n1119\n01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,290\nit's doing everything via broadcast.\n\n1120\n01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:37,080\nI think usually the security method\nwhen we talk about securing the DC.\n\n1121\n01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:40,490\nWhen we talk about securing DHCP-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1122\n01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,650\n>> In just normal server classes,\n\n1123\n01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:45,790\nyou know, the option is to make\nsure they don't have physical\n\n1124\n01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:47,170\naccess to your network, right?\n\n1125\n01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,040\nEither wireless or wired.\n\n1126\n01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,059\nWhich isn't a whole lot of help.\n\n1127\n01:01:51,059 --> 01:01:53,340\n[LAUGH] So.\n\n1128\n01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,050\nAll right, well a few good things there.\n\n1129\n01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:59,010\nTalked about some DHCP\ntype of analysis service.\n\n1130\n01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:04,120\nWe talked about, we went through a couple\nof different ping options there.\n\n1131\n01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:06,830\nSo why don't we go ahead and\ntake a little break.\n\n1132\n01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,620\nLooking at our clock,\nit's getting close to that time.\n\n1133\n01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,750\nSo I think we'll take one more break and\n\n1134\n01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:14,540\nwhen we come back we're going to\ntalk more about denial of services.\n\n1135\n01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,460\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n1136\n01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:24,040\n>> [NOISE] [SOUND] Right, that'd be sweet.\n\n1137\n01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,950\n>> All right,\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1138\n01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:29,370\nSo continuing on with\nour denial of service.\n\n1139\n01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:33,810\nWe need to talk about some of the ways\nthat we might be able to protect ourselves\n\n1140\n01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:37,380\nfrom some of these DOS and DDOS attacks.\n\n1141\n01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:40,560\n>> Yeah, we definitely need to\nlearn the defensive strategies\n\n1142\n01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:47,530\non, for protecting against the DOS,\nand there's plenty of them out there.\n\n1143\n01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,650\nSome of them were even alluded to, but\n\n1144\n01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,190\nwe should really get, kind of,\nmake sure we address them all.\n\n1145\n01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:54,470\nFirst of all for\n\n1146\n01:02:54,470 --> 01:03:00,320\nsome of the things we have against DOS\nare right up front are our firewalls.\n\n1147\n01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,190\n>> Those act as a primary level of defense\nfor that, they can, stateful firewalls\n\n1148\n01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,730\ncan just drop some of the stuff before\nthey are even, hit anything behind us.\n\n1149\n01:03:08,730 --> 01:03:13,240\nAnd if you don't know what a stateful\nfirewall is go to Wikipedia.\n\n1150\n01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,375\n>> Go back and watch our, yeah, or\ngo back and watch our Cisco episode is for\n\n1151\n01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:16,189\nyou subscribing members.\n\n1152\n01:03:16,189 --> 01:03:18,429\n>> Yeah, go do that.\n\n1153\n01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:22,562\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Research if you must.\n\n1154\n01:03:22,562 --> 01:03:25,438\nSo.\n\n1155\n01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:27,657\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [SOUND] I gotta stop that, right?\n\n1156\n01:03:27,657 --> 01:03:29,015\nYeah.\n\n1157\n01:03:29,015 --> 01:03:32,080\n[LAUGH] It's Friday.\n\n1158\n01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:35,771\n>> It is Friday in some of our minds.\n\n1159\n01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:39,400\n[LAUGH] You guys have seen it out there,\nright?\n\n1160\n01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:39,920\nI mean, ping.\n\n1161\n01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,338\nThere's a few different types\nof attacks we can do with ping.\n\n1162\n01:03:42,338 --> 01:03:45,870\nBut during the episode we told you that\nmost of our systems are patched against\n\n1163\n01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:47,458\nthose types of vulnerabilities.\n\n1164\n01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:51,195\nI'm sure you've also noticed a lot of\nwebsites don't even respond to ping\n\n1165\n01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:52,038\npackets at all.\n\n1166\n01:03:52,038 --> 01:03:53,675\nBecause they know-\n>> Not uncommon, yeah.\n\n1167\n01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:56,614\n>> They know there's a few different\nvectors of attack that we can use\n\n1168\n01:03:56,614 --> 01:03:57,465\nwith those.\n\n1169\n01:03:57,465 --> 01:04:01,670\nThey'll say, heck, to mitigate that risk,\nlet's just not use ping packets.\n\n1170\n01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:04,130\nDo I really need to be able to\nping that server from the outside?\n\n1171\n01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:06,000\nMaybe I decide I don't.\n\n1172\n01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,930\nOr maybe I'd like to but\nthe risk is not worth it.\n\n1173\n01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:12,810\nSo the easiest way to mitigate those is\njust to turn off the response to pings.\n\n1174\n01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:17,980\n>> Yes, that's a very common tactic that\ncompanies will block ping coming in,\n\n1175\n01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,260\nbecause they just may not\nneed it from that angle.\n\n1176\n01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,440\nSo they just decide not to.\n\n1177\n01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:26,940\nAnd that's something you kinda gotta\ndecide for yourself, if it's something\n\n1178\n01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,590\nthat you really do want to shut off,\nor something that you wanna live with,\n\n1179\n01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:35,950\nbecause there are definite\nbenefits of having ping.\n\n1180\n01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:40,630\nI myself remember when they started\nrealizing ping could be a problem on\n\n1181\n01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:43,530\nnetworks and allow it to be mapped out and\nstuff like that,\n\n1182\n01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:48,800\ncompanies shut off ping passing at all\nof the routers and devices internally.\n\n1183\n01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:50,060\n>> Internally, yeah.\n\n1184\n01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,020\n>> And imagine what we're saying here.\n\n1185\n01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:56,650\nWe're saying turn off ping in every\nplace internally so it can't be passed.\n\n1186\n01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:58,970\nNow do your network troubleshooting.\n\n1187\n01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:02,040\n>> I was gonna say, look at any\ntroubleshooting model that you've learned\n\n1188\n01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,560\nin A+, Net+ and our Windows classes.\n\n1189\n01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,470\nAnd one of the steps is to check for\nelectrical connectivity, which is what\n\n1190\n01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:12,580\nmy SNP or with my ping packets, my,\nwhat is it, echo request number eight.\n\n1191\n01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,616\nThat's what we use.\n\n1192\n01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:17,420\nSo if you've turned those off,\nblanket turned those off,\n\n1193\n01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:21,750\nI've just eliminated a very\nuseful troubleshooting method.\n\n1194\n01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:26,240\nSo we maybe wanna take a look at where we\nwant to disable that and not turn it off.\n\n1195\n01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,720\n>> Yeah, they kind of eased up on\nthat thinking and saying that,\n\n1196\n01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,130\nwell that's not the best way to do it.\n\n1197\n01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,810\nSo they start doing it around the border.\n\n1198\n01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:38,760\nBecause they figured okay, well going out\nand coming in, we can do without that.\n\n1199\n01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:42,290\nFor troubleshooting internally,\nit'll be on, it'll be fine and be on.\n\n1200\n01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:44,670\nSo they did that.\n\n1201\n01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:48,560\nAnd that's just one way of stopping a DOS.\n\n1202\n01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:54,600\nOther ones we have are an IPS,\nan intrusion prevention system,\n\n1203\n01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,210\nwhich we're gonna get to\nin a little more detail.\n\n1204\n01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:02,190\nBut it is a device that will not\nonly detect but do things to\n\n1205\n01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:09,280\nstop an attack, not just a denial\nof service, from progressing.\n\n1206\n01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,990\nOnce it detects it, it take actions\nagainst it on a defensive posture and\n\n1207\n01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:17,140\nit could be reconfiguring\nthings on a firewall or\n\n1208\n01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:22,260\ndoing stuff on a router to block it and\nkeep it from going any further.\n\n1209\n01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:26,050\nIt's also worth mentioning, a lot of\neven the modern routers even have stuff\n\n1210\n01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:29,700\ninto it to block the spread\nof denial of services.\n\n1211\n01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:32,160\nSo if stuff starts replicating\nacross your network and\n\n1212\n01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:35,290\ncausing things, they will actually\nstart sensing that and shut them down.\n\n1213\n01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:39,580\nI believe Cisco's family of routers,\nI don't know what the feature is called,\n\n1214\n01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,030\noff the top of my head, but\nthey have a feature built in like that,\n\n1215\n01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,985\nthat also acts as a really\ngood defensive strategy.\n\n1216\n01:06:46,985 --> 01:06:48,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1217\n01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,710\nYeah, for some of the others like DHCP,\n\n1218\n01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:55,640\nI think we kind of mentioned that one of\nthe biggest defensive mechanisms you can\n\n1219\n01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,340\nuse is to make sure that they can't talk\nto your DHCP server in the first place.\n\n1220\n01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,520\nWhich means preventing them\nfrom accessing your network,\n\n1221\n01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:04,500\nwhich should be a part of\nmy normal security anyway.\n\n1222\n01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:08,680\nThere's other things we can\nkind of tie in with DHCP, but\n\n1223\n01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,940\nthey don't really do\nanything to DHCP itself.\n\n1224\n01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,130\nThey're looking at ways of still\npreventing you from accessing it,\n\n1225\n01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:19,200\nlike network access protection\nmaybe on a Windows system.\n\n1226\n01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:24,315\nBut really it comes down to making sure\nour RADIUS, my port based authentication,\n\n1227\n01:07:24,315 --> 01:07:27,115\nbut none of that is really\nsecuring the DHCP server itself.\n\n1228\n01:07:27,115 --> 01:07:30,635\nIt's more about making sure you can't\nget to it if you're not authorized.\n\n1229\n01:07:30,635 --> 01:07:34,039\n>> You could, technically you\ncould even go into DHCP and\n\n1230\n01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:37,591\nreduce the lease time,\nit doesn't stop the attack, but\n\n1231\n01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:42,555\nit prevents the IP address from staying\nout of circulation for so long.\n\n1232\n01:07:42,555 --> 01:07:44,175\nBut there's things that go with that too.\n\n1233\n01:07:44,175 --> 01:07:49,130\nI mean, you might sound like oh,\nI will turn my DHCP down to,\n\n1234\n01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,990\ninstead of eight days, let it be a day.\n\n1235\n01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:55,920\nOkay, that's still probably all right but\nonce you get shorter than that,\n\n1236\n01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,415\nnow what happens, you're getting\nseveral renewal requests per day.\n\n1237\n01:07:59,415 --> 01:08:00,400\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> And\n\n1238\n01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,140\nnow you're generating\na whole bunch of traffic.\n\n1239\n01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,750\n>> So you're gonna do a denial of service\non your own DHCP server because now you've\n\n1240\n01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,780\ngot those renewals coming\nin every 12 hours.\n\n1241\n01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:11,336\nYeah, you basically fell on your\nown sword at that point and\n\n1242\n01:08:11,336 --> 01:08:14,360\nit's just not smart to do that.\n\n1243\n01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:19,130\nSo, DHCP doesn't have a ton\nin the way of protection.\n\n1244\n01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:21,960\nBut there's stuff you can do around it,\nfor\n\n1245\n01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:24,240\nlayers wrapped around it that\nmakes it a little bit better.\n\n1246\n01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,380\n>> And auditing, we don't want to\nforget about that auditing and\n\n1247\n01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,530\nreading those log files so that I notice\nthat we're almost running out, or\n\n1248\n01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:34,810\nwe've run out of IP addresses before\nit maybe becomes a big issue.\n\n1249\n01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:38,570\nRemember all your clients that already\nhave IP addresses they've got that lease.\n\n1250\n01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:41,775\nSo it's really the people that\nare obtaining new leases,\n\n1251\n01:08:41,775 --> 01:08:43,595\nthose are the ones that\nare gonna be affected.\n\n1252\n01:08:43,595 --> 01:08:47,425\nSo it's not like your entire network's\ngonna just all of a sudden go up so\n\n1253\n01:08:47,425 --> 01:08:47,975\nI've got time.\n\n1254\n01:08:47,975 --> 01:08:51,045\nIf I can get in there and monitor and see\nthis thing going on, and say holy crap,\n\n1255\n01:08:51,045 --> 01:08:55,010\nI'm out of all my IP addresses and start\nreleasing a bunch of those bogus ones,\n\n1256\n01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:59,510\nor increase the size of your scope\nto include more IP addresses.\n\n1257\n01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:03,870\nSo there's things we can do to\nhelp with that type of attack.\n\n1258\n01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,820\n>> Yeah, and you bring up a good point.\n\n1259\n01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:10,930\nThere's always a value in\nhaving logging capabilities\n\n1260\n01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:15,360\nin place so\nyou can track this type of stuff.\n\n1261\n01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:20,023\nThat could even be where a host based IDS\nstarts picking stuff up and saying okay,\n\n1262\n01:09:20,023 --> 01:09:23,670\nI've got some abnormal activity and\nthey could flag it to you.\n\n1263\n01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:26,987\nSo there's just some things\nyou need to think about,\n\n1264\n01:09:26,987 --> 01:09:32,160\nlike there's multiple layers to go around\nsome of these more sensitive services.\n\n1265\n01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,790\n>> With DNS, that's another tough one.\n\n1266\n01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:37,380\nIt is relatively open.\n\n1267\n01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,550\nAlthough they've recently added a few\ndifferent things that we can use to\n\n1268\n01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:43,140\nkinda help security,\nand that's like DNSSEC\n\n1269\n01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:47,360\nto make sure I'm getting the response\nfrom an authorized DHCP server.\n\n1270\n01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:52,720\nConfiguring who has administrative\naccess to that DNS server,\n\n1271\n01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,720\nallowing dynamic updates from only known,\ntrusted clients, for example.\n\n1272\n01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:03,850\nTrying to prevent some of those records\nfrom being generated in the first place.\n\n1273\n01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:08,150\nDNS now, I know in Windows and\nI'm not sure about all my other systems.\n\n1274\n01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:12,136\nI know in Windows,\nyou can also control the cache.\n\n1275\n01:10:12,136 --> 01:10:16,420\nYou can say that once a record gets dumped\ninto cache, it cannot be modified for\n\n1276\n01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:21,200\na certain percentage, or\n100% of its cache life, that TTL.\n\n1277\n01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,690\nJust to try to prevent people\nfrom modifying cache records and\n\n1278\n01:10:23,690 --> 01:10:25,750\ndoing some of that DNS poisoning.\n\n1279\n01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:29,050\nSo some of the things we might try to\ndo to help secure DNS from a denial of\n\n1280\n01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,780\nservice attack.\n\n1281\n01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:34,926\n>> Yes, smart advice to secure DNS.\n\n1282\n01:10:34,926 --> 01:10:37,433\nAnd you're saying, yeah DNS,\nit does have options,\n\n1283\n01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:39,790\nespecially if you integrate\nit back to directory.\n\n1284\n01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:44,470\nYou get a substantially more\nprotection than you would otherwise.\n\n1285\n01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:47,433\nThat is available, but\nhaving that additional platform\n\n1286\n01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:51,860\nknowledge like you talked about,\nall the options there, is invaluable.\n\n1287\n01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,310\nIt really is, not all the options that\nyou talked about are actually enabled by\n\n1288\n01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:57,624\ndefault, you actually have to enable them.\n\n1289\n01:10:57,624 --> 01:10:59,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can't enable them if you don't know\n\n1290\n01:10:59,790 --> 01:11:00,700\nthey're there.\n\n1291\n01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,280\nThis is again the kind of,\nand it goes back towards\n\n1292\n01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:06,120\none of the questions that we saw in the\ndiscussion group a little earlier about,\n\n1293\n01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,460\ngetting a job in the field and all that.\n\n1294\n01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:16,790\nYou can have the certification, but\nknowing these little details and\n\n1295\n01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:22,918\nthat they're out there, are going to\nincrease your stand, these little tricks.\n\n1296\n01:11:22,918 --> 01:11:27,300\nSo file these things away,\nlearn these things, and get used to them.\n\n1297\n01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,170\n>> Yep, go back and\nwatch all of our classes.\n\n1298\n01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:32,260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Now, not after we're done.\n\n1299\n01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,340\n>> Exactly.\n\n1300\n01:11:33,340 --> 01:11:35,560\nYeah, and\nI got a question in the chat room there.\n\n1301\n01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:38,930\nSomebody's mentioning BIND,\nthat Berkeley Internet Name Daemon,\n\n1302\n01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:43,363\nwhich is the DNS engine for\nLinux, or that we run on Linux.\n\n1303\n01:11:43,363 --> 01:11:46,540\nAnd, I'm not familiar with that enough\nto know if some of those options\n\n1304\n01:11:46,540 --> 01:11:50,250\nare available in there but now that you\nknow about them, you can go check it out.\n\n1305\n01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,989\nYou know, look for them,\nsaved you a little research.\n\n1306\n01:11:51,989 --> 01:11:57,088\n>> Yeah, there's some similar stuff\nover there on the BIND servers,\n\n1307\n01:11:57,088 --> 01:12:01,830\nbut Yeah, as Mike says,\nyou need to familiarize yourself with\n\n1308\n01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:06,404\nwhat version you have and\nwhat options are available to you.\n\n1309\n01:12:06,404 --> 01:12:10,378\nAnd the great thing about a lot of stuff,\nespecially things like Bind,\n\n1310\n01:12:10,378 --> 01:12:11,777\nit's well documented.\n\n1311\n01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:13,629\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's very well documented,\n\n1312\n01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,399\neven better than Microsoft stuff is.\n\n1313\n01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:19,021\nIf you're willing to spend the time,\nyou can find the security guidance on it.\n\n1314\n01:12:19,021 --> 01:12:20,554\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n1315\n01:12:20,554 --> 01:12:24,866\nWhat else can we do to help defend\nourselves besides cut our network off from\n\n1316\n01:12:24,866 --> 01:12:26,173\nthe rest of the world?\n\n1317\n01:12:26,173 --> 01:12:28,518\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not a bad option.\n\n1318\n01:12:28,518 --> 01:12:31,660\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n1319\n01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:37,140\n>> There's plenty of things that\nyou can do to cut yourself,\n\n1320\n01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:40,600\ncut these problems from happening.\n\n1321\n01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,090\nThere's different types of filtering\nyou can do traffic coming by.\n\n1322\n01:12:47,190 --> 01:12:51,990\nWe talked about the Smurf or the Fraggle\nattack, shutting off people contacting\n\n1323\n01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:57,770\nthat broadcast address, is just\nsomething that's, is not a good thing.\n\n1324\n01:12:57,770 --> 01:13:00,765\nSo most places do shut those\nthings off too that way, cuz,\n\n1325\n01:13:00,765 --> 01:13:03,713\nthere's not a reason for\nyou to be pinging that address.\n\n1326\n01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:04,398\n>> Right.\n\n1327\n01:13:04,398 --> 01:13:08,019\n>> The system is being patched,\nas you mentioned,\n\n1328\n01:13:08,019 --> 01:13:12,535\nanother really great strategy\nto stop some of these things.\n\n1329\n01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,220\nJust be aware of some of\nthese different things.\n\n1330\n01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,290\nOther defensive measures that\nyou can put into place for\n\n1331\n01:13:20,290 --> 01:13:24,600\ncritical systems, load balancing or\nredundancy are huge.\n\n1332\n01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:28,310\nIf you're someone like an Amazon, a dial\nservice is just unacceptable to you.\n\n1333\n01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:29,490\nYou know it's going to happen.\n\n1334\n01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:30,530\nYou're a huge target.\n\n1335\n01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:32,430\nYou've got a big target\npainted on your back.\n\n1336\n01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:39,075\nSo what's gonna happen is people are gonna\nstart directing assaults at you.\n\n1337\n01:13:39,075 --> 01:13:42,875\nIf that's the case, what you do is\nyou do things like load balancing.\n\n1338\n01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:46,035\nYou do things like different geographic\nlocations and stuff like that,\n\n1339\n01:13:46,035 --> 01:13:47,315\nspread it out.\n\n1340\n01:13:47,315 --> 01:13:50,860\nAmazon is a really prime example of that.\n\n1341\n01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,664\nThey do.\nI said Amazon and Prime.\n\n1342\n01:13:52,664 --> 01:13:54,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Product placement.\n\n1343\n01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:59,981\nAll right.\nSo, I'm getting good at this.\n\n1344\n01:13:59,981 --> 01:14:01,479\n>> You just got yourself a free Prime\naccount for the next three years.\n\n1345\n01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:02,094\n>> Ka ching.\n\n1346\n01:14:02,094 --> 01:14:04,556\nYeah.\nThere you go.\n\n1347\n01:14:04,556 --> 01:14:05,542\nAll right.\n\n1348\n01:14:05,542 --> 01:14:10,454\nBut the thing is that Amazon is a good\nexample of this because what you\n\n1349\n01:14:10,454 --> 01:14:14,936\nhave is you have a situation\nwhere you've got a company that,\n\n1350\n01:14:14,936 --> 01:14:19,465\nAmazon doesn't have\na physical presence anywhere.\n\n1351\n01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:23,895\nYeah they sell Kindle's in\nthe occasional store here and there.\n\n1352\n01:14:23,895 --> 01:14:29,665\nBut for the most part, aside from\nthose Office Max's, and Staples,\n\n1353\n01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:35,365\nand stuff like that, Best Buy's, that they\nsell Kindles in, and other places as well.\n\n1354\n01:14:35,365 --> 01:14:36,975\nThere's no physical presence there.\n\n1355\n01:14:36,975 --> 01:14:42,010\nSo, if their web server goes down,\nthat company's dead, until that's fixed.\n\n1356\n01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:43,640\nAnd that would be a dramatic event.\n\n1357\n01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:45,930\nThat would be a very, very dramatic event.\n\n1358\n01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:48,258\nI mean, think about it,\ncan you remember, Mike,\n\n1359\n01:14:48,258 --> 01:14:50,109\nthe last time you saw Amazon go offline?\n\n1360\n01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:52,187\n>> That I typed in amazon.com and\nit wasn't available?\n\n1361\n01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,090\nNo, I cannot.\n\n1362\n01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:57,270\nI was just trying to remember,\nI've read the statistic once on\n\n1363\n01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:01,700\nhow much they would lose per 15 minutes or\nquarter hour that they were down.\n\n1364\n01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,030\nAnd it's a mind-boggling number,\nit's like no way, that can't be right.\n\n1365\n01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:08,260\nYou look at it again and you're like\ncounting the commas in there and\n\n1366\n01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:11,360\nit's an unbelievable amount of money\nthat they would lose, just for\n\n1367\n01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:12,290\nbeing down for 15 minutes.\n\n1368\n01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:16,180\nSo, they can't, as you said,\nthey can't have\n\n1369\n01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:20,470\na DOS attack bring down their website,\nit's just going to be too costly.\n\n1370\n01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:22,620\nBut that also means,\nthat they have more money to pump into it.\n\n1371\n01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:24,720\nRight?\nBecause when we look at risk analysis,\n\n1372\n01:15:24,720 --> 01:15:28,140\nif it's going to cost me millions\nof dollars per 15 minutes,\n\n1373\n01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:32,710\nthen I'm okay spending a few hundred\nthousand dollars and mitigating that risk.\n\n1374\n01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:34,480\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1375\n01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,480\nThat's where the whole risk reward thing,\n\n1376\n01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,180\nor cost benefit, comes in,\nis I spend as much here, but\n\n1377\n01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:45,570\ndoes this give me enough benefit to keep\nit from being a problem on the other side?\n\n1378\n01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:46,990\nSo you really gotta think about it.\n\n1379\n01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:51,120\nAnd in Amazon's case, yeah they've\ngot a lot of money sitting around and\n\n1380\n01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:55,680\na lot of money invested in\nmaking the business work.\n\n1381\n01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:58,525\nThey cannot have down time.\n\n1382\n01:15:58,525 --> 01:16:03,930\nSo what they're going to do is they\nare going to make sure they have multiple\n\n1383\n01:16:03,930 --> 01:16:07,160\ncenters and\nall this load balancing stuff like that.\n\n1384\n01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,900\nTo be successful doing\na DOS against Amazon,\n\n1385\n01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:13,360\nyou better have a lot\nof luck on your side.\n\n1386\n01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,630\nAnd it's probably better for\n\n1387\n01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:17,831\nyou to go to Vegas and\ngamble [LAUGH] before you do that.\n\n1388\n01:16:17,831 --> 01:16:21,350\n>> You need one of those million botnets,\nI think.\n\n1389\n01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,015\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or more.\n\n1390\n01:16:22,015 --> 01:16:27,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, if you're lucky, you\n\n1391\n01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:29,860\nmight slow him down or annoy him.\n\n1392\n01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:33,120\nIt's very rare for Amazon to go offline.\n\n1393\n01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:37,070\nI've actually seen it go offline.\n\n1394\n01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:39,820\nYou said you can't remember, for\n\n1395\n01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:44,370\nme the time I saw it go offline\nI was actually in Germany.\n\n1396\n01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:48,200\nAnd I was so just kinda, just no.\n\n1397\n01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:50,614\n>> It was just like,\nyou type it in again, I made a typo here.\n\n1398\n01:16:50,614 --> 01:16:51,694\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh yeah, I did.\n\n1399\n01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:53,890\nI kept looking and going,\nthis isn't, there's no way.\n\n1400\n01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,850\nThere's just no way.\n>> Or connect to a different website, and\n\n1401\n01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:56,640\nsee if it's off.\n\n1402\n01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,521\n>> Yeah,\nI was doing all sorts of things in there.\n\n1403\n01:16:58,521 --> 01:16:59,791\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then it's like,\n\n1404\n01:16:59,791 --> 01:17:02,747\nI literally picked up my cellphone,\nI'm calling buddies in the states,\n\n1405\n01:17:02,747 --> 01:17:03,950\ngoing just type into Amazon.\n\n1406\n01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:07,000\nLike aren't you in Germany, don't you have\nInternet access, I'm just like shut up and\n\n1407\n01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,685\ntype it in.\n\n1408\n01:17:07,685 --> 01:17:09,610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they're typing it in and\n\n1409\n01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:10,600\nit's not coming up.\n\n1410\n01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,830\nAnd I'm like, okay.\n\n1411\n01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:13,250\nAnd I wouldn't even believe the first guy,\n\n1412\n01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,085\nI had to call like two\nmore just to confirm.\n\n1413\n01:17:15,085 --> 01:17:18,270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What those guys said, and\n\n1414\n01:17:18,270 --> 01:17:21,250\nas they were saying okay, it's offline.\n\n1415\n01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:23,565\nIt was offline for like, two hours.\n\n1416\n01:17:23,565 --> 01:17:25,760\n>> Wow.\n>> It was just shocking.\n\n1417\n01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,199\nI can remember what I was\ndoing [LAUGH] at that time.\n\n1418\n01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:29,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what a big\n\n1419\n01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:30,950\nimpression it made on me.\n\n1420\n01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:33,931\n>> I remember when the shuttle exploded,\nwhen the wall came down, and\n\n1421\n01:17:33,931 --> 01:17:35,093\nwhen Amazon was offline.\n\n1422\n01:17:35,093 --> 01:17:35,860\n>> Amazon was offline.\n\n1423\n01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,075\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1424\n01:17:39,075 --> 01:17:40,155\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n1425\n01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:41,188\nBut like you said,\n\n1426\n01:17:41,188 --> 01:17:45,516\nthey've got the distributed system where\nit would take a very well organized,\n\n1427\n01:17:45,516 --> 01:17:49,990\nwell thought out, well planned, well\nexecuted attack to try to bring them down.\n\n1428\n01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:52,920\nBecause they do so\nmuch in the way of redundancy.\n\n1429\n01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,950\nIt's like our root DNS servers, and\n\n1430\n01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:56,790\nthere's always attacks\ngoing on those guys.\n\n1431\n01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:01,344\nI don't know if anybody's ever brought\none completely down, like you said,\n\n1432\n01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:04,114\nit slowed one down, but\nyou have 13, right?\n\n1433\n01:18:04,114 --> 01:18:06,737\n>> I honestly think the most\nsuccessful one brought six.\n\n1434\n01:18:06,737 --> 01:18:08,083\n>> It brought six of them down?\n\n1435\n01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:10,556\n>> Yeah, and\nit was substantial when it did it.\n\n1436\n01:18:10,556 --> 01:18:16,080\n>> Yeah, that's 50% of our name resolution\npyramid there, so that's a good one.\n\n1437\n01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,890\n>> I believe they added on more\nafter that because is it still 13?\n\n1438\n01:18:18,890 --> 01:18:20,730\n>> Yeah, well,\nwhen they say 13 root servers,\n\n1439\n01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:25,730\nremember there's 13 organizations that\nmaintain a root server a through m.\n\n1440\n01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:29,740\nBut if you go look at like c or\nd, it's actually 53 sites\n\n1441\n01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:33,570\nscattered around the world and\neach one of those sites is a server farm.\n\n1442\n01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:37,830\nSo it's not like there's 13\nDell 745's at the root there.\n\n1443\n01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,250\nDon't wanna give you that impression.\n\n1444\n01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:41,300\nYeah, so again,\n\n1445\n01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,990\nit's just one of those things where it\nwould take an ungodly number of resources\n\n1446\n01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:48,520\nto really have an effective\nattack on those guys.\n\n1447\n01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,751\n>> Yeah, I know they knocked out\na reasonable amount of the capacity of\n\n1448\n01:18:51,751 --> 01:18:53,490\nthe root servers at one point.\n\n1449\n01:18:53,490 --> 01:18:58,340\nAnd yeah, you're right, they found\na flaw in those systems, I believe\n\n1450\n01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:03,320\nit was not in the DNS systems, it was\nin the operating systems underneath it.\n\n1451\n01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:07,090\nAnd they just went through and\nswept through, and took them out that way.\n\n1452\n01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:09,750\nBut still a fantastic feat to pull off.\n\n1453\n01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:16,520\nAnd losing half the DNS servers for\nthe Internet, it was a major slowdown.\n\n1454\n01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,370\nAnd it was dramatic.\n\n1455\n01:19:19,370 --> 01:19:24,089\nI happened to be online when\nthat was happening, and\n\n1456\n01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:26,380\nI couldn't believe how\nslow my Internet got.\n\n1457\n01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:29,829\nIt just went [SOUND] and then eventually,\nthe pages you go to starts,\n\n1458\n01:19:29,829 --> 01:19:32,747\nyou had to hit refresh several\ntimes before they came up.\n\n1459\n01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:35,370\nTry things and then they wouldn't come up\nat all, and you're like what the hell?\n\n1460\n01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,357\nAnd you had to go onto one of these,\n\n1461\n01:19:38,357 --> 01:19:43,102\nyou had turn on the TV and\ngo to one of the news channels.\n\n1462\n01:19:43,102 --> 01:19:45,424\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And they'd be like,\n\n1463\n01:19:45,424 --> 01:19:50,059\nthe internet's going, or the internet's\nslowed down, or being disrupted.\n\n1464\n01:19:50,059 --> 01:19:54,789\nIt's since it's been fixed,\nyou wouldn't be able to do that anymore,\n\n1465\n01:19:54,789 --> 01:19:56,502\nor at least not like that.\n\n1466\n01:19:56,502 --> 01:20:02,155\nBut it was a huge, huge thing\nthat someone was able to do that.\n\n1467\n01:20:02,155 --> 01:20:03,290\nAnd like you said,\nAmazon would be the same way.\n\n1468\n01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:10,295\nAmazon, in their case, it turned out\nit was a technical problem internally.\n\n1469\n01:20:10,295 --> 01:20:12,165\nAnd so it wasn't an external thing.\n\n1470\n01:20:12,165 --> 01:20:16,924\nBut still it makes an impression on you\nwhen you see something like that go down,\n\n1471\n01:20:16,924 --> 01:20:19,765\ncuz that's supposed to always be there.\n\n1472\n01:20:19,765 --> 01:20:22,085\n>> And it's like air, water and\nthe sun coming up tomorrow.\n\n1473\n01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:24,780\nAmazon should be there when I go online,\nso.\n\n1474\n01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:27,070\n>> Which you can order from Amazon,\njust in case you need it.\n\n1475\n01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:27,580\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1476\n01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,503\n>> So get a subscription, it's cheaper.\n\n1477\n01:20:30,503 --> 01:20:32,848\n>> Now we got the

baby.\n\n1480\n01:20:41,544 --> 01:20:43,953\n>> [LAUGH] He is.\n\n1481\n01:20:43,953 --> 01:20:48,740\nAnd thanks, McKayla just posted in\nthe chat room there a couple of figures.\n\n1482\n01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:53,475\nAnd I won't go through all of her math,\nbut broke down to about 120,000 per minute\n\n1483\n01:20:53,475 --> 01:20:55,888\nthat Amazon could lose\nif they were offline.\n\n1484\n01:20:55,888 --> 01:21:00,021\nThat's a lot of money,\nthat's a lot of money.\n\n1485\n01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,263\n>> Yeah, ka-ching, right?\n\n1486\n01:21:01,263 --> 01:21:03,950\n[LAUGH]\n>> But it shows you\n\n1487\n01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:07,770\nwhy they're willing to put so much into it\nand why they spent so much time trying to\n\n1488\n01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:10,930\nprotect themselves against these types of\nattacks, these denial of service attacks.\n\n1489\n01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:12,480\nAnd they're always changing, right?\n\n1490\n01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,820\nIt's just like everything else\nwe've talked about in security.\n\n1491\n01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,170\nIt's not like these are the only attacks.\n\n1492\n01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,230\nThis is all there ever will be, and\nif you're protected against these,\n\n1493\n01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,252\nyou're safe.\n\n1494\n01:21:20,252 --> 01:21:23,520\nYou've gotta stay on top of things, and\nyou've gotta pay attention to new attack\n\n1495\n01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,845\nmethods, and\nnew attack vectors that are coming out.\n\n1496\n01:21:25,845 --> 01:21:29,474\nWe're introducing new operating systems,\nnew services, new protocols, and\n\n1497\n01:21:29,474 --> 01:21:32,991\nall of that, and each one of those could\nbring along a whole new can of worms, so\n\n1498\n01:21:32,991 --> 01:21:33,494\nto speak.\n\n1499\n01:21:33,494 --> 01:21:38,416\nSo it's a constant cat and mouse battle,\ntrying to keep these safe.\n\n1500\n01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:42,845\n>> Yeah, a good security person\nis always gonna be thinking,\n\n1501\n01:21:42,845 --> 01:21:47,110\nis always gonna try to\nthink several steps ahead.\n\n1502\n01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:47,980\nAnd it's tough.\n\n1503\n01:21:47,980 --> 01:21:49,180\nIt's very tough.\n\n1504\n01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:53,020\nI'm not gonna say, oh, it's not like\nI'm telling you, oh, it's that easy!\n\n1505\n01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:54,675\nYou know, thanks for\nthe secret of life there.\n\n1506\n01:21:54,675 --> 01:21:58,237\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, I know it's not gonna be easy, but\n\n1507\n01:21:58,237 --> 01:22:03,870\nyou're gonna have to have good\nsources to research stuff from.\n\n1508\n01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:09,760\nI mean, even if you never become a full-on\npen tester, or a pen tester at all,\n\n1509\n01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,820\nthe knowledge you have here kinda tells\nyou, kinda lets you in on the thinking\n\n1510\n01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:21,150\nof what a bad guy would do, can do or\ncould do to you if they really wanted to.\n\n1511\n01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:25,020\nSo you could start figuring\nout your next steps, and\n\n1512\n01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:28,030\ncan you start getting inside\ntheir thought processes and\n\n1513\n01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:30,940\nreally make sure that you don't\nbecome a victim of this stuff.\n\n1514\n01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:32,165\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1515\n01:22:32,165 --> 01:22:33,725\nKnow thy enemy and what was it?\n\n1516\n01:22:33,725 --> 01:22:36,874\nKnow thy enemy and need not fear\nthe death of a thousand battles, or\n\n1517\n01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:37,951\nsomething like that.\n\n1518\n01:22:37,951 --> 01:22:38,868\n>> Yeah, close enough.\n\n1519\n01:22:38,868 --> 01:22:40,366\n>> But that's all we ask, close enough.\n\n1520\n01:22:40,366 --> 01:22:41,109\n>> That's fine.\n\n1521\n01:22:41,109 --> 01:22:42,665\n>> That's my paraphrased version.\n\n1522\n01:22:42,665 --> 01:22:43,519\nBut it's Friday, it's Saturday in my mind.\n\n1523\n01:22:43,519 --> 01:22:45,621\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm on the beach right now.\n\n1524\n01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:48,162\n[LAUGH]\n>> So yeah, whatever.\n\n1525\n01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:49,579\nLet us all meditate.\n\n1526\n01:22:49,579 --> 01:22:52,783\nOhm.\n\n1527\n01:22:52,783 --> 01:22:55,314\n>> You know, if we had our green screen,\nwe could throw the beach back there, but.\n\n1528\n01:22:55,314 --> 01:22:58,774\nSo anyways, so I digress,\nback to security.\n\n1529\n01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:00,353\n>> They don't know it's\nnot a green screen.\n\n1530\n01:23:00,353 --> 01:23:01,676\nThat's a green screen.\n\n1531\n01:23:01,676 --> 01:23:04,172\nThat's Waikiki back there.\n\n1532\n01:23:04,172 --> 01:23:06,343\nHold on, let me check,\nI gotta get my drink.\n\n1533\n01:23:06,343 --> 01:23:09,638\n[LAUGH]\n>> I know you just got back from Hawaii,\n\n1534\n01:23:09,638 --> 01:23:12,220\nSean, did you practice your hula?\n\n1535\n01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,274\n>> Yeah, we don't wanna get into that,\nbut yeah.\n\n1536\n01:23:14,274 --> 01:23:15,570\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, now he gets shy on me.\n\n1537\n01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:17,000\n>> Yeah, they made me do that.\n\n1538\n01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,709\nMy date's like a girl, [SOUND] yeah.\n\n1539\n01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,428\n>> Here it is.\n\n1540\n01:23:21,428 --> 01:23:22,566\n>> Yeah, I got the stuff,\nand now I did some of this.\n\n1541\n01:23:22,566 --> 01:23:24,411\nThat isn't hula, by the way.\n\n1542\n01:23:24,411 --> 01:23:25,689\nThat's just something that I did.\n\n1543\n01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:29,009\n>> That's the butter churn\n>> That's my chronic white boy dance.\n\n1544\n01:23:29,009 --> 01:23:35,000\n>> [LAUGH] See,\nyou're getting CEH and so much more.\n\n1545\n01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,118\nI mean, you know.\n\n1546\n01:23:36,118 --> 01:23:38,990\nAll right, well,\nanything else we wanna throw in here\n\n1547\n01:23:38,990 --> 01:23:41,920\non protecting ourselves against\nthese denial of service attacks?\n\n1548\n01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:46,480\n>> We've hit the big points\non denial of service.\n\n1549\n01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:49,140\nLike I said,\nremember what they're trying to do.\n\n1550\n01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:51,020\nThey're trying to chew up resources.\n\n1551\n01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:53,970\nThey're trying to take your services down,\nso\n\n1552\n01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:57,980\nwe can throw more resources at it,\nwe can also degrade services.\n\n1553\n01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:01,140\nIt's possible for that, so\nif you degrade it it makes it harder for\n\n1554\n01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:05,270\nthem to chew those things up, and\nit kind of frustrates their attack.\n\n1555\n01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:10,660\nOr sometimes you just gotta kinda\nstick your head in the sand and\n\n1556\n01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:15,000\nstop everything, shut it down,\nand wait for it to pass.\n\n1557\n01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,720\nThat's just the way it works.\n\n1558\n01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:23,400\nThat's what happened when we talk about\nthat Operation Payback a bit ago.\n\n1559\n01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:29,380\nThat's what happened in that deal is\nOperation Payback, Visa, and Paypal and\n\n1560\n01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:35,060\nthese guys had to pull their\nservers offline for a period\n\n1561\n01:24:35,060 --> 01:24:40,590\nof time to kind of wait for the storm to\npass before they put them back online.\n\n1562\n01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:43,989\nWhen they took them offline, they were\nfiguring out, dissecting logs, and\n\n1563\n01:24:43,989 --> 01:24:46,920\ndoing forensic analysis and\nall to figure out what had happened and\n\n1564\n01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:50,459\nwhat they could do, and put the things\nback online so it wouldn't be a problem.\n\n1565\n01:24:50,459 --> 01:24:55,609\nSo, yeah, there's definite steps\nyou can do to block these things,\n\n1566\n01:24:55,609 --> 01:25:01,723\nbut just think about what their goals are\nand how they're carrying out the attack,\n\n1567\n01:25:01,723 --> 01:25:06,723\nand there's pretty much ways you\ncan thwart a lot of these attacks.\n\n1568\n01:25:06,723 --> 01:25:12,960\nYou won't necessarily be able to stop\nthem completely, keep that in mind.\n\n1569\n01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:18,610\nEven if someone hits you with\nseveral million attackers,\n\n1570\n01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:23,845\nand you have enough to withstand that,\nyou're still gonna be slower.\n\n1571\n01:25:23,845 --> 01:25:26,440\nAnd that's just the nature of the beast.\n\n1572\n01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:28,704\nThe question is, how much slower?\n\n1573\n01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,039\nAnd how noticeable is it?\n\n1574\n01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:31,002\n>> And is it acceptable?\n\n1575\n01:25:31,002 --> 01:25:34,688\n>> Yeah,\nyou have to think about these things,\n\n1576\n01:25:34,688 --> 01:25:38,090\nbuild some resiliency into your system.\n\n1577\n01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:39,920\n>> Very good.\n\n1578\n01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,776\nAll right, ladies and\ngentlemen, I'll tell you what,\n\n1579\n01:25:41,776 --> 01:25:43,100\nwe had a really good episode here today.\n\n1580\n01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:45,530\nWe talked about denial of service.\n\n1581\n01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:48,520\nStarted off talking about some of the\ndifferent vectors of attacks that we can\n\n1582\n01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,780\nuse with a denial of service or\nthat they can do a denial of service with.\n\n1583\n01:25:51,780 --> 01:25:54,960\nWe talked about the difference\nbetween a denial of service and\n\n1584\n01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,960\na distributed denial of service.\n\n1585\n01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,540\nAnd then we rounded things off with\nsome of the defense mechanisms we might\n\n1586\n01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:05,410\nput in place to help protect our networks\nfrom these denial of service attacks.\n\n1587\n01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:07,060\nSo, hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1588\n01:26:07,060 --> 01:26:08,980\nRemember, if you have\na question

another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,310\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,230\nHow are you, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,320\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,160\n>> Fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,330\nWe've got another great show lined up for\nyou today,\n\n9\n00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,520\nwe're continuing on with our CEH episodes.\n\n10\n00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,370\nAnd today, we are going into Chapter 12,\nif you're following along.\n\n11\n00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,010\nRemember, everybody should be\nfollowing along at this point,\n\n12\n00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,154\nas I reach out of camera,\nmy director's gonna get mad.\n\n13\n00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:03,938\nCEH, Certified Ethical Hacker,\nVersion 8 Study Guide written by,\n\n14\n00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,720\nnone other than, Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n15\n00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,120\nSo again, we're hitting Chapter 12,\nwhich is our session hijacking.\n\n16\n00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,090\nWe'll take a look at some concepts\nof what session hijacking is.\n\n17\n00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,530\nAnd there's different kinds of session\nhijacking or maybe different category,\n\n18\n00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,740\nI guess we could call it.\n\n19\n00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,780\nThat's what we're gonna do today.\n\n20\n00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,640\nSo let's get started.\n\n21\n00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,411\nLet's start off with,\nwhat the heck is session hijacking?\n\n22\n00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:31,239\n>> Yeah, session hijacking's is one of\nthese things that you hear the term, but\n\n23\n00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:35,921\nit's kinda you really gotta drill down\nto really kinda get an idea of what's\n\n24\n00:01:35,921 --> 00:01:36,741\nhappening.\n\n25\n00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:42,679\nCuz in the past, session hijacking\nused to refer to just one area.\n\n26\n00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:45,610\nNow, it really covers two main areas.\n\n27\n00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:49,560\nAnd so, we're gonna explore those in here.\n\n28\n00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,790\nWhat session hijacking is, is first of\nall, let's focus on what a session is.\n\n29\n00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,630\nA session is just really refers\nto a connection between two hosts\n\n30\n00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,670\neither at the operating system level or\nat the application level in this case.\n\n31\n00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,502\nThat's all we're talking about.\n\n32\n00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:10,570\nAnd so, if you look at it as being,\nas being a connection between the two and\n\n33\n00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,970\nwe have a unique identifier and\nall that for it.\n\n34\n00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,310\nA hijack just means we are taking\nit over using some means.\n\n35\n00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,340\nAnd there's different mechanisms for\ntaking over a session.\n\n36\n00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,870\nBoth at the network level and\nthe application,\n\n37\n00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,160\nwe're talking web\napplications here by the way.\n\n38\n00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,990\nWe're getting to into that area now.\n\n39\n00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,990\nSo were just talking about there's an\nactive session between two valid parties.\n\n40\n00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,750\nAnd we just go through and we take\nit over and use it for our purposes.\n\n41\n00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,100\nThe question is what do\nwe do at that point.\n\n42\n00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,602\nSo that's kinda in\na nutshell what's happening.\n\n43\n00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:51,328\nWe're taking over in a already\nverified authenticated session.\n\n44\n00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:53,692\nAnd using it for\nwhatever we want to use it for.\n\n45\n00:02:53,692 --> 00:02:57,070\n>> All right, so instead of worrying about\ntrying to break somebody's credentials to\n\n46\n00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,220\nauthenticate, we just go ahead and\nlet them do the authentication as normal.\n\n47\n00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,710\nAnd then we just kinda step in and\n\n48\n00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,650\ntake over that already\nauthenticated session then.\n\n49\n00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,060\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n50\n00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,869\nThat cuts right to it is.\n\n51\n00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,900\nIf you're talking a session that's already\na similar, if you look at a connection\n\n52\n00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,040\nbetween two points, what you're doing\nyou're just saying it precisely.\n\n53\n00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,450\nSomeone's already authenticated to it.\n\n54\n00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,910\nWhy should I spend time if I can do this.\n\n55\n00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,090\nWhy should I spend time trying\nto break your credentials?\n\n56\n00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,924\nWell, I'll just wait till you connect,\nyou give your credentials and\n\n57\n00:03:32,924 --> 00:03:35,677\nthen I just take it over from then on out.\n\n58\n00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:40,120\nI just unplug you and say, hey,\nI've got it from this point.\n\n59\n00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,835\nThat's really all that's going on\nwith this specific type of attack.\n\n60\n00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:48,885\nIt's just a question of\nhow you carry it out.\n\n61\n00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:50,625\n>> Yeah, I mean, it sounds easy, right?\n\n62\n00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:53,538\nIt's like, well, how, why the heck did\nthey never bother cracking credentials or\n\n63\n00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:54,412\ndoing any of that stuff?\n\n64\n00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:55,100\n>> Yeah.\n>> Heck,\n\n65\n00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,485\nI'm just gonna wait until somebody\nconnects and then take over.\n\n66\n00:03:57,485 --> 00:04:01,555\nThat's the easiest route, but it turns\nout it's not quite as easy as that.\n\n67\n00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,750\nAnd there are some things\nthat have to be lined,\n\n68\n00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,840\nit's not like the stars have to align or\nanything, but\n\n69\n00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,750\nthere's a couple of requirements to be\nable to do session hijacking, right?\n\n70\n00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,500\n>> Yeah, yeah absolutely,\nyou have to have a few things in place and\n\n71\n00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,362\na few conditions actually\nlend themselves to this.\n\n72\n00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:24,220\nYou have different types,\nlike you said, network and application.\n\n73\n00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,770\nNetwork tends to be and\n\n74\n00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:32,140\nI'm talking by way of comparison I'm\nnot talking you, you just in general.\n\n75\n00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,620\nNetwork hijackings seems to be\nthe easiest of the two, because it's\n\n76\n00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,120\nreally straight forward in concept and\nit's relatively easy to carry out.\n\n77\n00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,769\nApplication tends to be a little more.\n\n78\n00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,570\nBut once you've met those conditions.\n\n79\n00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,310\nYeah you can carry this type of the attack\nout and take over or validate the session.\n\n80\n00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,110\n>> Right yeah,the first thing\nthat pops in my mind is the fact\n\n81\n00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,780\nthat if I'm going to take\nover someones session,\n\n82\n00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,280\nI've definitely got to be connected to\nthe network that the session is going on.\n\n83\n00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,240\nWhereas password cracking,\n\n84\n00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,720\nthings like that I don't necessarily\nhave to be connected in there.\n\n85\n00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,750\nI might've done a pw dump, or got a bunch\nof hashes, or done password stealing,\n\n86\n00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,918\nor something like that,\nor offline cracking.\n\n87\n00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:18,010\nWhereas session hijacking, I am talking\nabout taking over this existing session,\n\n88\n00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,096\nso I need to be on that network or\nsomewhere in between that target and\n\n89\n00:05:22,096 --> 00:05:24,628\nthe server that they're connecting to.\n\n90\n00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:28,179\n>> Yeah, that's a good point.\n\n91\n00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:31,531\nWhat we should do is talk a little bit\nabout some of the prerequisites we got\n\n92\n00:05:31,531 --> 00:05:32,730\nto have in place for this.\n\n93\n00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,435\nCuz there are some when you talk\nabout things you have to have to make\n\n94\n00:05:37,435 --> 00:05:38,790\nthis attack work.\n\n95\n00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,590\nOne of the big ones here, is you basically\nyou've got to meet the same requirements\n\n96\n00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,890\nyou have for sniffing a network.\n\n97\n00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,150\nCuz it kinda starts from there.\n\n98\n00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,160\nSo that's kinda the cool thing.\n\n99\n00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,300\nIf you understand sniffing at this point,\nand we talked about that the other day.\n\n100\n00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,129\nIf you look at sniffing and\nthe prerequisites for that.\n\n101\n00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,429\nYou have to be in promiscuous mode, you\nneed to have access to networking to find\n\n102\n00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:03,300\na way to get two sniff a session between\nthe clients that you're interested in.\n\n103\n00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,690\nOnce you've met that criteria, the next\nstep is yeah you actually could take\n\n104\n00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,680\nsniffing and move over to\na session hijacking type attack.\n\n105\n00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,187\nIt's right in the same zip code.\n\n106\n00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:16,695\n>> Right, cuz you're already there,\nconnected to the network,\n\n107\n00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:18,844\nyou're already seeing\nthe traffic that's going by.\n\n108\n00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,407\nYou're capturing those packets,\n\n109\n00:06:20,407 --> 00:06:22,810\nyou can start reading some\nof those sequence numbers.\n\n110\n00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,970\nAnd other things that are in\nthat packet that I can then use\n\n111\n00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,870\nto escalate my attack from sniffing\nup to that session hijacking.\n\n112\n00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,090\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n113\n00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,850\n>> And then some tools we can use to\n\n114\n00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,600\nhelp us with this cuz it's not\nthe easiest thing in the world, right?\n\n115\n00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,910\nTCP is vulnerable to this, but they have\ndone a few things to try to prevent it,\n\n116\n00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,810\nso it becomes a little more complex,\nI think.\n\n117\n00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,060\nAt least in my mind.\n\n118\n00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,680\nStart looking at sequence numbers and\npacket inter-workings and\n\n119\n00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,835\nstuff like that and it gets tricky.\n\n120\n00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:57,060\n>> Yeah, that's the thing is that yes,\nit used to be really difficult.\n\n121\n00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,499\nYou had to be really on your game to pull\nthis off because when we're talking way\n\n122\n00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,604\nback, in the Dark Ages, so to speak,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n123\n00:07:04,604 --> 00:07:06,029\n>> It used to be that you to\n\n124\n00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:09,779\nknow how to do scripting,\nyou had to be really skilled, and\n\n125\n00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,090\nyou had to have some measure\nof luck to pull this off.\n\n126\n00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,900\nAnd that's when we were just talking,\nnetwork-level stuff.\n\n127\n00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,020\nWe weren't even talking web application\nstuff, cuz those things didn't exist,\n\n128\n00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:25,320\nwhen session hijacking\nfirst came into being.\n\n129\n00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,048\nSo you had to do all these\nthings to make it work.\n\n130\n00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,803\nAnd you kinda did that, the stars lined\nup with all your stuff from earlier.\n\n131\n00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:31,324\n>> Right.\n\n132\n00:07:31,324 --> 00:07:33,058\n[LAUGH]\n>> But now a days,\n\n133\n00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:34,667\nthey made it a lot easier.\n\n134\n00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:38,679\nThere's tools out there called JHijack,\n\n135\n00:07:38,679 --> 00:07:43,040\nTCP hunt or\nHunt as they sometimes call it.\n\n136\n00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,300\nAnd there's other ones out there that\nare associated with sniffing as well.\n\n137\n00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,493\nThat can be used to carry this out.\n\n138\n00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,465\nSo they've lowered the bar\nto carry this out.\n\n139\n00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:53,510\nIt still doesn't mean when I say,\nlowered the bar.\n\n140\n00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,344\nI mean hey, if you're a script kid, you're\ngoing to pull this off, I almost assure\n\n141\n00:07:57,344 --> 00:08:01,250\nyou that if you're a script kiddie you're\nnot gonna pull this type of thing off.\n\n142\n00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,580\n>> Right, right.\n\n143\n00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,290\nAnd then, and then some of the tools\nare even management tools.\n\n144\n00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,170\nAs we've said several times throughout\nsome of our different episodes,\n\n145\n00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,530\na lot of the tools start out as management\ntools and then kind of get used for\n\n146\n00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,400\nother purposes, because I remember that\nwe used to run a program called Altiris\n\n147\n00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,300\non an old network that we worked at.\n\n148\n00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,000\nAnd Altiris did a lot of things.\n\n149\n00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,190\nIt allowed me to do some imaging and\nthings like that.\n\n150\n00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,790\nBut one of the things it allowed me to\ndo was monitor sessions on my network.\n\n151\n00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:30,380\nAnd I could actually click a button and\nthen take over that session, but\n\n152\n00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,010\nit's a very expensive program.\n\n153\n00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,110\nIt's an enterprise level program.\n\n154\n00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,920\nSomething that you're probably not going\nto use if you're just trying to hack or\n\n155\n00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,520\nthings like that.\n\n156\n00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,360\nSo, you know, different ways we can\ncarry this out manually, using tools,\n\n157\n00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,970\nthings, like that.\n\n158\n00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,220\nSo, all right.\n\n159\n00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,720\nSo we've got an idea of\nwhat session hijacking is.\n\n160\n00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,680\nIt just means that I\nwant to try to talk over.\n\n161\n00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,600\nAn existing session and that can\noccur either at the network layer,\n\n162\n00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,500\nway down on the OSI model or\ncould you know take advantage or\n\n163\n00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,680\ntaking advantage of TCPIP I guess I\nshould say if I can get that out.\n\n164\n00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,650\nAnd or we could do it up at a higher\nlevel up there at the application layer.\n\n165\n00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:11,770\nAs you said, typically talking about\nHTTP and web based applications.\n\n166\n00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,892\n>> You know, you did, if I could interrupt\nyou, there is, actually is something,\n\n167\n00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:20,440\nI think we should also add into this,\nis you just,\n\n168\n00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,780\nas you were mentioning the TCP stuff\n>> It is important when you talk about\n\n169\n00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,260\ndoing session hijacking\nat the network level.\n\n170\n00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,325\nThe stuff we're talking\nabout's really IP four.\n\n171\n00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:29,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n172\n00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,770\n>> IP six it changes the nature\nof the beast substantially\n\n173\n00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,180\n>> IP four.\n\n174\n00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,140\nThey didn't consider security\nwhen they built that.\n\n175\n00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,270\nIt was designed to do communication,\nto be scalable,\n\n176\n00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,830\nto do all that type of stuff that\nit has succeeded very well at.\n\n177\n00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,280\nBut it was not designed for security.\n\n178\n00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,620\nTherefore it does that very poorly.\n\n179\n00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,800\nIn fact, the rule that someone\nargues it doesn't do it at all.\n\n180\n00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,650\n>> Right.\n\n181\n00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,190\n>> You know?\n\n182\n00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,890\nSo that's neither here nor there.\n\n183\n00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,510\n>> IP6 on the other hand, IP6,\nthey learned their lesson.\n\n184\n00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,440\nThey built this after a lot of this,\nyou know,\n\n185\n00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,460\nthis upsurge of different types\nof attacks and stuff like that.\n\n186\n00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,670\nSo they kind of, you know,\ntook the lessons that they learned and\n\n187\n00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,320\nbuilt that into and\nbuilt those lessons into IP6.\n\n188\n00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,750\nSo when IP6 starts to get more wider\nimplementation it's going to be this\n\n189\n00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,590\nthe session hijacked at network level, is\ngoing to change if it's possible at all.\n\n190\n00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,450\n>> All right.\n\n191\n00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,080\n>> And it is possible to put it out there.\n\n192\n00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,400\nIt's just a case of those conditions,\nwhere you are trying do it,\n\n193\n00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,630\nthat they actually exist.\n\n194\n00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,310\n>> Right right.\n\n195\n00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,380\nSo there's a thing we need\nto think about is this.\n\n196\n00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,630\n>> Person that we're trying to,\nis our target.\n\n197\n00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,375\nAre they using IPv6 to connect to this\nresource, or are they using IPv4?\n\n198\n00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:43,650\nCause that could play a big,\nmake a big difference in a method I use or\n\n199\n00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,450\nwhether it's even possible at all.\n\n200\n00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:45,990\nHm.\n\n201\n00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,610\nAbsolutely.\n\n202\n00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,270\n>> And you see that on, you know,\nTCP/IP, as you said, has been around for\n\n203\n00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,570\na long time, and\nyou see that in just about everything.\n\n204\n00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,430\nAnd, you know, I was saying it, we, but I\ndon't know why, it made me think of cars,\n\n205\n00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,490\nyou know, when cars first came out,\nsafety was not a concern, right?\n\n206\n00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,040\nIt was like, here's this great thing\nwe can use to get from one place to\n\n207\n00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,750\nthe other faster.\n\n208\n00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,930\n>> There were no seatbelts,\nthere were no airbags, blah, blah, blah.\n\n209\n00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,020\nBut then over time we learned\nwhat the vulnerabilities are,\n\n210\n00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,810\nthe weaknesses are and\nwe now start focusing on safety.\n\n211\n00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,360\nAnd I think it's the same\nthing with TCP/IP.\n\n212\n00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,100\nInitially it was like you said, a couple\nof universities, or DoD, or whomever.\n\n213\n00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,880\nThey weren't concerned with security.\n\n214\n00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,230\nThey just wanted to be\nable to connect computers.\n\n215\n00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,200\nThis is a really cool thing.\n\n216\n00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,680\nWe can share information.\n\n217\n00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,650\nThen, later on, we realized we\nprobably need to secure this stuff.\n\n218\n00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,770\nSo, IPv6 is going to\nchange a lot of things.\n\n219\n00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:35,815\nI thought we had great safety in cars\nyears ago, I thought it was awesome.\n\n220\n00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,360\n[LAUGH] I'll be driving, oh break.\n\n221\n00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,690\n>> The mom bar, right?\n\n222\n00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,290\n>> Yeah.\n>> I am old enough to remember when\n\n223\n00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:47,760\ncars didn't come with seatbelts\n>> You had seatbelts but\n\n224\n00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,580\nnobody ever wore them.\n\n225\n00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,570\nYou just clipped them and\nput them underneath the seats so\n\n226\n00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,380\nthe stupid buzzer didn't go off, right?\n\n227\n00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,314\n>> Yeah, no problem right there.\n\n228\n00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:57,217\n[LAUGH] That dain bramage is\ncleared up just nicely though.\n\n229\n00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,250\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n230\n00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,630\n>> I won't go there.\n\n231\n00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,230\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so.\n\n232\n00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,040\n>> They're all thinking it.\n\n233\n00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560\n>> Yes they are.\n\n234\n00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,380\nAs far as session hijacking,\nwe now get an idea of what it is.\n\n235\n00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,150\nSo let's break it down then, and\nlook at some of the different types.\n\n236\n00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,650\nAnd I guess we should start\nwith network based or TCP/IP,\n\n237\n00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:22,490\nbecause that is the older version, or\nit's the original session hijacking.\n\n238\n00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,810\nYeah.\nI don't know if I wanto to say a little\n\n239\n00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:29,350\nbit, I think you said a little bit easier\n>> Then say the application.\n\n240\n00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,720\n>> Yeah and when you could and,\nwe really should kind of.\n\n241\n00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,470\nYou know make sure we got\nthe disclaimer here on it\n\n242\n00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,320\nis that you know when you compare the two.\n\n243\n00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,535\nWe know,\nwe say network level hijacking easier.\n\n244\n00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:42,345\nIt is.\n\n245\n00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:43,075\nYeah.\n\n246\n00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:46,165\nIt's easier of the two or\nI'm not making anything up.\n\n247\n00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,455\n>> But it's not easy.\n\n248\n00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:48,055\n>> Yeah.\nYeah.\n\n249\n00:12:48,055 --> 00:12:52,155\nIn comparison to other stuff we've done,\nit's not the easiest.\n\n250\n00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:55,280\nThe thing to do,\nyou know after you've done it a few times,\n\n251\n00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,130\nit might be a little easier, but still,\ncompared to the other stuff we've done,\n\n252\n00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,010\nit's definitely not easy.\n\n253\n00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,390\nBut when you compare,\nyou know, application and\n\n254\n00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,890\nnetwork global session hijack,\nthis is the easiest of those two.\n\n255\n00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,420\nGood deal, good deal.\n\n256\n00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,220\nAll right.\n\n257\n00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,250\nSo we've got, you know,\nthe TCP layer or TCP/IP, I should say.\n\n258\n00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,570\nThat layer,\nwe can do some session hijacking.\n\n259\n00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,760\nOther type of session hijacking I think\nwe mentioned too was that application.\n\n260\n00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,490\nAnd then there's several\nsubcategories within\n\n261\n00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,010\nthat\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n262\n00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,670\n>> Right?\n\n263\n00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,406\n>> And that's the thing is that when you\ntalk to CPIP hijacking, there's really\n\n264\n00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:33,640\njust a set of conditions that lends\nitself to one set of session hijacking.\n\n265\n00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,560\nAnd that's it.\n\n266\n00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,412\nWhen you move up to the application level\nstuff and you're talking about web apps.\n\n267\n00:13:39,412 --> 00:13:42,940\nYou know,\nthere's many many ways to accomplish that.\n\n268\n00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,532\nSo, you know, you can come in\nat it different ways, you know.\n\n269\n00:13:46,532 --> 00:13:50,150\nSo it's, you know, so you kinda gotta,\nyou know, look at which one you're coming,\n\n270\n00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:50,880\nwhich one you're doing.\n\n271\n00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,290\nYou know, level of complexity, that's why\nwe say, TCP IP, you know, IP layer stuff.\n\n272\n00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,960\nThat's easy, you know, because you have\none way to do it, there's a specific set\n\n273\n00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,040\nof criteria that allows that to happen and\nthen you've got the, then you've got\n\n274\n00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,830\nthe application level stuff and\nthere's many different iterations and\n\n275\n00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,640\ncombinations and stuff that occur that can\nmake that possible and enable it, and,\n\n276\n00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,530\nyou know, maybe it's worthwhile,\nyou know, exploring that a bit.\n\n277\n00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,140\nYou know, what makes,\njust to kind of compare and\n\n278\n00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,890\ncontrast the two maybe we should\nactually talk about those conditions.\n\n279\n00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,650\nThat exist one verses the other\nthat makes it happen.\n\n280\n00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:31,530\nSo you get a better understanding of you\nknow kind of we're in the know here,\n\n281\n00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,540\nso we're just like that's easy.\n\n282\n00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,250\nAnd so we're going to let you\nguys figure that out on your own.\n\n283\n00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,240\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n284\n00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,330\n>> It's April Fools, we're not working.\n\n285\n00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:41,245\n>> Yeah.\n>> So.\n\n286\n00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:44,145\n>> Yeah, we're just goofing off today.\n\n287\n00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:48,800\n[LAUGH]\n>> In any case, you know,\n\n288\n00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,540\nwhen we look at it at the network level,\nwhat makes this actually happen.\n\n289\n00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,180\nIs, you know, kinda, to make that to\nunderstand what makes this happen,\n\n290\n00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,650\nwe going to drill into a little bit\nof that IP suite to understand it.\n\n291\n00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,800\nYou know, when you look at,\nwhen you look what happens,\n\n292\n00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,420\nwe're exchanging traffic back and\nforth between stations and,\n\n293\n00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,040\nif you drill into stuff like Wireshark and\n\n294\n00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,650\nyou look at this if you, and we only\ntalked about the flags the other day.\n\n295\n00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,550\nBut if you drill into Wireshark,\nyou open up and do a packet capture.\n\n296\n00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,670\nI'll notice on the TCP stuff and\nremember, we're talking TCP hijacking,\n\n297\n00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,060\nwhen you go into the TCP stuff and\nWireshark.\n\n298\n00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,990\nIf you look at it,\nthere were sequence numbers in there okay.\n\n299\n00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:34,560\nThat's an important part of this equation.\n\n300\n00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,300\n>> Right.\n\n301\n00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,160\n>> Is that we can't ignore those anymore.\n\n302\n00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,300\nYou know when we were\ndoing sniffing before and\n\n303\n00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,440\ntalking about attacks were\njust worried about the flags.\n\n304\n00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,060\nWe didn't care about, about the sequence\nnumbers that wasn't part of it\n\n305\n00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,240\nnow we're moving over and saying okay,\nlet's talk about those sequence numbers.\n\n306\n00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,201\nWell sequence numbers,\neverything that we talk about in TCP\n\n307\n00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:55,473\nis going to be stamped\nwith a sequence number.\n\n308\n00:15:55,473 --> 00:15:59,230\nSo it knows what order they came in,\nassemble them, and all that good stuff.\n\n309\n00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,954\nThat's, that's part of it.\n\n310\n00:16:00,954 --> 00:16:07,715\nThose numbers are, they're 32 bit numbers,\nand I can't remember the math.\n\n311\n00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:11,070\nThere some millions, and\nmillions of combinations.\n\n312\n00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,590\n>> Oh, gosh.\n\n313\n00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,650\nIf I had to remember, let's see.\n\n314\n00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:18,300\nWell, an IP address is 32 bits, and\nyou can have 16,277,000 I think,\n\n315\n00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,352\nor something like,\nno I take that back, there's 3.4.\n\n316\n00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:24,279\nAnyway yeah there's millions.\n\n317\n00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,963\n>> He doesn't know it,\nhe's making this up.\n\n318\n00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,217\n>> Yes I do,\n>> Not smart.\n\n319\n00:16:27,217 --> 00:16:28,846\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've got to get the brain,\n\n320\n00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:30,061\nI haven't had my coffee yet this morning.\n\n321\n00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:33,346\nI gotta get the brain kicking in here.\n\n322\n00:16:33,346 --> 00:16:36,773\nIf we had every possible,\navailable IP address for\n\n323\n00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:42,205\n32 bits you can have something like 3,\n4, 3.4 billion address, right?\n\n324\n00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:43,644\n>> Yeah, it, it's a pretty high number.\n\n325\n00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:45,327\n>> Because yes, uh-huh.\n\n326\n00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:49,180\n>> Yeah it's so, yeah, but\nthat's better than I would've gotten.\n\n327\n00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,160\n>> Well, and also if you think about it,\nthat's what great about computers, right.\n\n328\n00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,340\nYou can take information from\none section you know, and\n\n329\n00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,970\nyou can apply it to other sections.\n\n330\n00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,450\nIf you think about memory, a 32-bit system\ncan only access 4 gigs of RAM, that\n\n331\n00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:06,600\nbecause the biggest number I can write\nwith 32 bits is just under 4 billion.\n\n332\n00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,115\nSo that means there's something like\n4 billion possibilities so yeah.\n\n333\n00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:15,820\n>> Yeah and we don't need to\nbe dead on with the number.\n\n334\n00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,770\nYou get the point that there's\na lot of combinations there.\n\n335\n00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,731\nSo with that 32 bit number,\nyeah, there's a lot.\n\n336\n00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:29,900\nSo that means we got a big pool\nof sequence IDs we can use.\n\n337\n00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,530\nSo what happens is a station,\nwhen there's two stations are talking,\n\n338\n00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,500\nthey pick a starting number and\nthey just count up from there.\n\n339\n00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,640\nAnd what we're doing is, we are when\nwe're doing session highjacking,\n\n340\n00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,080\nwhat we're trying to do is we're actually\ntrying to predict at the network level,\n\n341\n00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,810\ntrying to predict what the next\nsequence number will be and jump in and\n\n342\n00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:52,450\ninject that sequence\nnumber at the right time.\n\n343\n00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,870\nTherefore meaning when we transmit at\nthe right time, we take over that session.\n\n344\n00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,120\n>> Right.\n>> And at that point we can just say,\n\n345\n00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,448\nbye-bye to that person who initiated\nthat session, now we are talking.\n\n346\n00:18:03,448 --> 00:18:07,163\nSo that's an important\nkey to this whole thing.\n\n347\n00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:08,388\nYou can sniff the network, and\n\n348\n00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:11,250\nonce you sniff the network you\nare observing that traffic.\n\n349\n00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,500\nAnd you see those sequence numbers and\nthen you just hop right in,\n\n350\n00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,530\ntake it over and boom.\n\n351\n00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,010\nYou're going right on from there.\n\n352\n00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,575\n>> Right.\n\n353\n00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:21,260\nYeah and that's one the things that makes\nit a little bit difficult is trying to\n\n354\n00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,020\npredict some of those sequence numbers,\nright.\n\n355\n00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,930\nTrying to figure out what that next\nsequence number's going to be.\n\n356\n00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,540\n>> Yes that is the difficult part there.\n\n357\n00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,871\nIt sounds like the way we've explained it,\nwe talked about how many different numbers\n\n358\n00:18:32,871 --> 00:18:36,929\nthere are, talking about hey, they come\nin order, all you got to do is sniff it.\n\n359\n00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:40,357\nIt sounds like,\noh well I don't see the difficulty there.\n\n360\n00:18:40,357 --> 00:18:44,468\nThose things are flying pretty fast and\nfurious and you've got to make sure you-\n\n361\n00:18:44,468 --> 00:18:45,246\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n362\n00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:47,240\n>> Get that dead on.\n\n363\n00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,430\nIf you don't get that dead on and injected\nat the right time into the network,\n\n364\n00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,340\nwhat's gonna happen is\nthat you will either,\n\n365\n00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,285\nyou'll break the existing connection or\nit's just gonna out and out fail.\n\n366\n00:18:58,285 --> 00:18:58,800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n367\n00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,330\n>> And either one of those\nis not a desirable outcome\n\n368\n00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,330\nto what you're trying to accomplish.\n\n369\n00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,304\nSo it does take some skill.\n\n370\n00:19:05,304 --> 00:19:07,951\nIt used to be that you had to do\nthis through scripts or something.\n\n371\n00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:10,970\nYou had to go through and\ndo something to delay traffic or\n\n372\n00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,650\nkind of slow it down to jump in.\n\n373\n00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:18,050\nThere are ways to make it a little\neasier but still wasn't really easy.\n\n374\n00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,162\nIt wasn't like hey turn on a sniffer and\nyou're watching stuff and\n\n375\n00:19:21,162 --> 00:19:22,170\nyou're ready to go.\n\n376\n00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,460\nNo, you had,\nyou're actively engaged in that and\n\n377\n00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,100\nhave to make sure you do these things the\nright way, or it just isn't gonna work.\n\n378\n00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,600\nRight.\n\n379\n00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:34,830\nSo there's a lot to it.\n\n380\n00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,590\nThat's why some of those tools\nthat can help us automate this,\n\n381\n00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,390\ndo make it a little bit easier.\n\n382\n00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,850\nAnd if I'm not mistaken, it's not\nincremented just by like 1 every time.\n\n383\n00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,800\n>> Oh, that definitely not.\n\n384\n00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,650\nNo.\n\n385\n00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,838\n>> That would be a relative easy to\nstart predicting the next numbers.\n\n386\n00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:53,666\nBut they've got some algorithms that they\nuse to increment that number to make it\n\n387\n00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:56,580\na little more difficult\nto predict the next one.\n\n388\n00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:03,104\n>> Yeah there's a, just to kind of,\nto talk to that point a bit,\n\n389\n00:20:03,104 --> 00:20:09,636\nis we were talking earlier on in\nour lessons here with the CEH.\n\n390\n00:20:09,636 --> 00:20:15,813\nWe we're talking about ways to\nidentify a specific operating system.\n\n391\n00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:19,492\nAnd it used to be actually able to,\nand you still can in some cases,\n\n392\n00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:23,503\nyou used to be able to identify an\noperating system just by firing a couple\n\n393\n00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:27,289\nof packets at it and watching what\nsequence number it started with.\n\n394\n00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,636\nAnd by what sequence number it started\nthat connection with on its side,\n\n395\n00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:35,095\nit would tell you this is the,\nand it was a Microsoftism.\n\n396\n00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:38,872\nYou'd fire something out, it responds back\nwith a packet with a certain number on it.\n\n397\n00:20:38,872 --> 00:20:42,281\nYou're oh, that's this version\nof this operating system.\n\n398\n00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,938\nBecause it would always start with\nthe exact same sequence number.\n\n399\n00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:46,541\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n400\n00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:50,237\n>> That's since changed,\nit's randomized a bit more, but\n\n401\n00:20:50,237 --> 00:20:53,790\nthat used to be one of the easy\nways to fingerprint in OS.\n\n402\n00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:54,520\n>> Right.\n\n403\n00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,670\n>> It was very predictable.\n\n404\n00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,540\nSince then, like I said,\nthey've changed it.\n\n405\n00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,307\n>> Thankfully.\n[LAUGH]\n\n406\n00:20:58,307 --> 00:20:58,807\n>> Yeah.\n\n407\n00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,582\n>> Make it a little more difficult, right.\n\n408\n00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:06,280\nAll right well I'll tell you what,\nso we were talking about the,\n\n409\n00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,820\nagain right now we're just\ntalking about the types of\n\n410\n00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,710\nsession hijacking that we have to deal\nwith or that we might be able to try.\n\n411\n00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,900\nAs we got our network hijacking which\nis done at that TCP/IP layer and\n\n412\n00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,965\nthen at the application layer.\n\n413\n00:21:19,965 --> 00:21:24,560\nWe've got a few different categories we\ncan kind of break that down into as well.\n\n414\n00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,690\n>> Yes there's many different level\nof things that can happen at the,\n\n415\n00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,655\nwhen we're talking about applications.\n\n416\n00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:34,240\nAnd I saw here at, just to make sure\nwe're clear about it, I saw here in the,\n\n417\n00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,620\nin our discussion groups I saw people\nmentioning the acronyms for the OSI model,\n\n418\n00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,772\nwhich is great [LAUGH]\nthat you guys know that.\n\n419\n00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,030\nIt's kinda sorta related to that.\n\n420\n00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:54,176\nWe just to make sure we're clear though,\nwe are talking it because I\n\n421\n00:21:54,176 --> 00:22:00,794\ndon't wanna get to closely associated with\nOSI and think it's same as network stuff.\n\n422\n00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:03,640\nThis is distinctly something we're\ntalking with web applications.\n\n423\n00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,140\nSo why the protocols do exist\nthat we're messing with,\n\n424\n00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,670\ndo exist at that top layer of OSI.\n\n425\n00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,960\nRemember, we are talking about web\napplications so don't start getting\n\n426\n00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,390\ntoo drawn down into oh,\nit's exactly the same as network level.\n\n427\n00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,880\nIt's not.\n>> All right well let's see.\n\n428\n00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,286\nI know we don't really want to\njump into how it works just yet.\n\n429\n00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:32,598\nThat's gonna be a little more in depth so\nanything else we want to add to\n\n430\n00:22:32,598 --> 00:22:37,585\nwhat session hijacking is and what types\nof session hijacking we have out there?\n\n431\n00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:42,635\n>> Luke said what we have to remember now,\nwe've got the two main categories.\n\n432\n00:22:42,635 --> 00:22:44,900\nWe're going to be drilling\ninto the application stuff,\n\n433\n00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,796\ncuz there's a lot more\nstuff happening there.\n\n434\n00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:48,388\n>> Okay.\n>> The network level,\n\n435\n00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:52,974\nwe have the one type, but we're still\ntaking over a session that is validated,\n\n436\n00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:55,980\nwhat we're doing is\nhere is we're sniffing.\n\n437\n00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:03,070\nWe're monitoring that session, and\nthen once that person validates,\n\n438\n00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:06,920\nwe look for the correct sequence number or\nmonitor the sequence numbers.\n\n439\n00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,360\nAnd we inject our traffic\n\n440\n00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,180\nat the right time and then kick off\nthe person that had previously,\n\n441\n00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,250\nthe host that authenticated to it, and\nnow at that point we have the session.\n\n442\n00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,870\nAnd we can start injecting our own\ncommands to the person on the other side,\n\n443\n00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,600\nand that person,\nthat client to the side actually\n\n444\n00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,150\nthinks that we are the person\nthat we disconnected.\n\n445\n00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:30,820\nWhy?\n\n446\n00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,680\nBecause they authenticated to it.\n\n447\n00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,170\n>> So they authenticate and then we step\nin, kick them out of the way because we\n\n448\n00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,960\ndon't want them trying to\ncontinue the conversation right.\n\n449\n00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,420\nWe want to trick that other end into\nthinking we are they, so that that traffic\n\n450\n00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,930\ncomes to us and we can't have them\ncontinue to send data back to that server.\n\n451\n00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,595\nThat server's gonna realize\nsomething is wrong.\n\n452\n00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,489\n>> Um-hm.\n>> So a big part of it is,\n\n453\n00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:56,435\nnot only getting in there and\ntaking over that session, but then kicking\n\n454\n00:23:56,435 --> 00:24:01,402\nthe end target out so that they don't\ninterrupt your now owned session.\n\n455\n00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:02,178\n>> Right.\n\n456\n00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:05,743\nSo, All right, well, I tell you what,\nlooking at the clock its about time for\n\n457\n00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:06,726\nus to take our break.\n\n458\n00:24:06,726 --> 00:24:09,892\nSo, why dont we stop here and\nwhen we come back we will continue on,\n\n459\n00:24:09,892 --> 00:24:13,710\nwe will dive a little further into\nthe world of session hijacking.\n\n460\n00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,264\nSo, stay tuned, we will be right back.\n\n461\n00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:22,266\n[MUSIC]\n\n462\n00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:23,000\nAll right.\n\n463\n00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,360\nWelcome back, ladies and gentleman.\n\n464\n00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,240\nContinuing on with our\nSession Hijacking episode.\n\n465\n00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,180\nWhat do you have lined up next, Sean?\n\n466\n00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,870\n>> Well, we have to talk about\napplication level hijacking.\n\n467\n00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,840\nThat's the next step.\n\n468\n00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,370\n>> All right.\n\n469\n00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,010\n>> Where we're going on this journey.\n\n470\n00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,960\nSo, you know, we just talked about,\nyou know, network level hijacking and\n\n471\n00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,830\nwe determined that network\nlevel hijacking is,\n\n472\n00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,230\nyou know,\neasier than the application level.\n\n473\n00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:53,770\nThere's really just one thing you can do,\nand you just gotta get that down and, and,\n\n474\n00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:57,240\nand you're right it do\nnetwork level hi jacking.\n\n475\n00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240\nAs long as you meet\nthe prerequisites that is.\n\n476\n00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,890\n>> Yeah, cuz tcip doesn't change right?\n\n477\n00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean tcip is tcip so\n\n478\n00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,770\nonce you get that\n>> That down, you're good to go.\n\n479\n00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,900\nBut we step into the world\nof applications,\n\n480\n00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,720\nnow we got a lot of variables\nwe gotta deal with.\n\n481\n00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,550\n>> Yeah.\n\n482\n00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,430\nSo yeah, once we move up to\nthe application level it's\n\n483\n00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:14,970\na whole new ball game there.\n\n484\n00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:20,190\nOnce you once you,\nyou know get into that whole arena.\n\n485\n00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,210\nSo we've got different types\nof attacks we can employ.\n\n486\n00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,810\nIt's no longer a case of\nguessing sequence numbers,\n\n487\n00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,800\nit's a case of doing additional\n>> You know,\n\n488\n00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,210\nadditional things to get the,\nthe right result.\n\n489\n00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,135\nSo, you know, we are talking mostly\nabout web applications at this point.\n\n490\n00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,080\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And and\n\n491\n00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,110\nwhen we talk about web applications, the\nsession IDs in, in web applications and\n\n492\n00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:45,000\nstuff of that level, they are different.\n\n493\n00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,260\n>> You know, we're at, we're, in essence,\nwhen we're talking at you know,\n\n494\n00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,640\nat the network level, we're talking about\nspecifically, you know, sequence numbers\n\n495\n00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,960\nand stuff like that,session IDs and,\nand web applications are different.\n\n496\n00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,970\nWhat they are is, if you look at a URL,\nwe have all the, we have, we have a whole\n\n497\n00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,350\nURL, then we have some gobblety gook\nat the end that represents, you know,\n\n498\n00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,670\nthat whole thing represents a session ID,\nor at least that last part does.\n\n499\n00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:15,310\nWhen you look at that session ID, that\nhas to be unique or should be, excuse me,\n\n500\n00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,010\nshould be unique for every individual\nconnection that we that you know,\n\n501\n00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:23,240\nthat we make to a web application,\nbut sometimes it isn't.\n\n502\n00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,370\n>> Some cases it's easily determined\nwhat's actually going on.\n\n503\n00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,380\nSo there's a number of things\nthat can happen around it, but\n\n504\n00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,940\nwe want to be able to grab and\ndo stuff with that session id at the end.\n\n505\n00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,890\nSo that's what we're focused on, so\nit's a question of You get that.\n\n506\n00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,230\nAnd what you can do, once you have that.\n\n507\n00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,070\n>> Right.\nSo, and if you think about\n\n508\n00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,810\nthat terminology.\n\n509\n00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,300\nJust think about it for\na second, you know?\n\n510\n00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,580\nThe sequence numbers are dealing\nwith individual packets,\n\n511\n00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,080\nmaking sure those packets can flip back\nin the right order at the other end.\n\n512\n00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,590\nSession ID, you know?\n\n513\n00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,700\nThat's my session that I've established\nwith this server that's the web\n\n514\n00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,920\napplication.\n\n515\n00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,400\nSo it really should be unique for each.\n\n516\n00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,250\nIndividual connection, each person that's\nconnected to that web application, and,\n\n517\n00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:05,300\nbut it should remain the same for\nall my data that's traveling back and\n\n518\n00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,560\nforth with that application, right?\n\n519\n00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,800\nThat's the way for the application to\nkeep track of the packets that belong\n\n520\n00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,260\nto this particular session.\n\n521\n00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,190\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n522\n00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,870\nThe question is, with the, when we\nhave that session ID, those numbers at\n\n523\n00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,370\nthe end of the, at the end of the URL,\nyou know, you know, what does that mean?\n\n524\n00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,511\nWell, we, means we can,\nmeans we can take over someone's session-\n\n525\n00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,048\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n526\n00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,063\n>> That's already the,\n\n527\n00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:30,150\nthat's already authenticated,\nor we can make up a session.\n\n528\n00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:34,860\nAnd say we've been authenticated or\ntrick someone to using that session ID.\n\n529\n00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,650\nSo there's a number of\nthings you can do that.\n\n530\n00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,090\nBut it all revolves around those,\naround those sayings.\n\n531\n00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,710\nOne of things we can do for\n\n532\n00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,030\nexample is something called\na man in the browser attack.\n\n533\n00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,890\nYou might be able to tell from the name\nwhat's happening with that type of attack.\n\n534\n00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,090\nA man in the browser It means,\nman the browser means you have, you know,\n\n535\n00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:57,220\nyou've got something installed\ninto the browser to allow you to\n\n536\n00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,250\nintercept those session ID's.\n\n537\n00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,630\nI saw in the discussion group,\nsomeone mentioned the Fire Sheep.\n\n538\n00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,320\nFire Sheep is,\nit's an add on for Fire Fox.\n\n539\n00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:12,570\nYou cannot get it in the Fire Fox store\n>> Any more you actually have to go out.\n\n540\n00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,430\nTo the best of my knowledge, you can't\nget into the Firefox store anymore.\n\n541\n00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,950\nLast time I looked it was gone.\n\n542\n00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,900\nYou actually have to go and\ngrab it from a third party source so\n\n543\n00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,205\nyou may have to let your fingers do the\n>> The walking.\n\n544\n00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,180\n[LAUGH] And, and\n\n545\n00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,560\nfind that yourself and be careful I\nguess is the way when you go find it.\n\n546\n00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,960\n>> I was going to say yeah i was thinking\nabout posting a link to it but on,\n\n547\n00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320\non the second thought I'm like no,\n\n548\n00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,910\nno because you're gonna\nbe getting it from some.\n\n549\n00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:40,100\nI, I don't trust any of the I would have\nto Double check on some of these sources\n\n550\n00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,205\nbefore I just make that available to you.\n\n551\n00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:47,130\n>> Yeah, I personally use this new online\nsharing service called Bit torrent.\n\n552\n00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,740\nYou can download a copy from there.\n\n553\n00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,660\nI left it up there for you.\n\n554\n00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,830\nSo, but in any case, yeah, it's out there,\nyou're going to have to get it from.\n\n555\n00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,970\nYou wont be able to get it from Firefox,\nMozilla or Firefox, or whatever.\n\n556\n00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,020\nYou'll have to go to a to\na third party to get that.\n\n557\n00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,870\nOnce you do that, you put a, you,\nyou install them, and, and Firefox,\n\n558\n00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:15,110\nit will allow you to do stuff\nwith those session IDs.\n\n559\n00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,710\nYou may actually recall, and\nI don't know if you recall, Mike,\n\n560\n00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:20,855\nthat OFO and\nFiresheet came on scene a few years ago?\n\n561\n00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:21,560\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n\n562\n00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,360\n>> Oh, yeah,\nthere was a big controversy over it.\n\n563\n00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,330\nIt's like, it allows you to steal all this\nstuff in Yuca, and take over people's.\n\n564\n00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,630\nYou know connections and steal information\nabout their Facebook account and\n\n565\n00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,310\nthis account, and that's why it actually\nwas originally published in their store,\n\n566\n00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,870\nand as soon as all this controversy came\nup, they stripped it out and said no,\n\n567\n00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,700\nit's not going up there ever again.\n\n568\n00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,230\nAnd hence, we you know, we have you\nknow people often that go out and and\n\n569\n00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,720\nget it from another stores.\n\n570\n00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,690\n>> Yeah.\n>> But actually,\n\n571\n00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,720\nit's a legit,\nit actually is a legitimate tool.\n\n572\n00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,070\nIt's It's like anything we talked about\n>> Right, you can use it for good or\n\n573\n00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,160\nevil\n>> Right\n\n574\n00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,890\n>> This is a case where it's something\n\n575\n00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,900\nthat as an application developer\nyou might really strongly consider\n\n576\n00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:02,810\ngetting your hands on this\nto test your application.\n\n577\n00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,500\nYour web applications to see if\nthey're going to have any problems.\n\n578\n00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,600\n>> Come on.\n\n579\n00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,520\nHelp you see what information your\nown application is actually making\n\n580\n00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,660\navailable or exposing.\n\n581\n00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,810\nWe had a good question\nfrom Michaila out there.\n\n582\n00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:17,630\nIf a browser creates multiple connections\nto a server to speed up page load,\n\n583\n00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,350\nare we hijacking all connections, just\none session or just one connection in one\n\n584\n00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:25,860\nsession, and from my understanding Shawn,\nyou might have multiple connections to,\n\n585\n00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,020\nto pull down more data, but\nit's still one session.\n\n586\n00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,870\n>> Yes.\n>> And\n\n587\n00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,830\nthat's how it keeps all those\nconnections tied to that one session.\n\n588\n00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,330\n>> Yeah.\nRemember, there can be only one.\n\n589\n00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,207\n>> There can be only one.\n\n590\n00:30:36,207 --> 00:30:38,685\n[LAUGH] One session to rule them all,\nright?\n\n591\n00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:41,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah that's the best\n\n592\n00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,470\n>> Precisely right, yes.\n\n593\n00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,930\nThere's one session.\n\n594\n00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,230\nThat's, that's multiple connections,\nthat's done at a lower level.\n\n595\n00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,250\nWe're not really concerned with that.\n\n596\n00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,910\nThey're still all handled under\nthe banner of one session.\n\n597\n00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,680\nSo, great question.\n\n598\n00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,190\n>> There we go.\n\n599\n00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:56,640\nEh, That's.\n\n600\n00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,930\n>> All right, so we got this, this man in\nthe browser type of attack is one of them.\n\n601\n00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,330\nWhat's another one we need to talk about?\n\n602\n00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,600\n>> Yeah, there's the, so\nwe have the man in the browser, so\n\n603\n00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,520\nwe know what that's doing.\n\n604\n00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,860\nThe next one we can take a look at is\nsomething called session fixation,\n\n605\n00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:17,950\nwhich you might be able to kinda\nglean a little from its name,\n\n606\n00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:20,290\nwhat's actually happening there.\n\n607\n00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:22,710\nA session fixation means that\n\n608\n00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:28,270\nan attacker is able to intercept\nsomehow a valid session ID.\n\n609\n00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:33,410\nAnd once they intercept that valid session\nID, the, what they wanna do is use that\n\n610\n00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:38,880\nand somehow entice a valid user To\nauthenticate using that session ID.\n\n611\n00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,550\nSo I'm going to find some\nway to get that to you.\n\n612\n00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,760\nAnd you've got a lot of ways\nto get someone to authenticate\n\n613\n00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,880\nwith that valid session ID.\n\n614\n00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,760\nSo, once I find out what\nthe valid session ID is, I can for\n\n615\n00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,855\nexample, maybe set a phishing\nemail out with it.\n\n616\n00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:55,284\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know and so\n\n617\n00:31:55,284 --> 00:32:00,816\nI craft url that includes that session\nid in it, and I create a very realistic\n\n618\n00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:06,694\nphishing email you click on that link you\ngo that website using that session id and\n\n619\n00:32:06,694 --> 00:32:11,795\nyou authenticate And now I can grab\nyour information at that point, so\n\n620\n00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:17,876\nit's a really, really effective way of\ndoing things if an application allows it.\n\n621\n00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:22,578\nAn application may not, or\nit shouldn't, I shouldn't say may not.\n\n622\n00:32:22,578 --> 00:32:24,824\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It shouldn't allow this cuz what should\n\n623\n00:32:24,824 --> 00:32:28,182\nhappen is if you previously\nauthenticated with a session ID,\n\n624\n00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:32,070\nyou shouldn't have a situation where\nthat session ID's still valid.\n\n625\n00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,400\nIt should be expired.\n\n626\n00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,370\nIt should only be valid for a certain\nperiod of time, and then just chucked.\n\n627\n00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,320\n>> If this situation happens,\nuas a PIN tester,\n\n628\n00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,340\nyou're really kinda stuck\non what you can do.\n\n629\n00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,070\nYou can make the recommendation\non what they can fix.\n\n630\n00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,910\nBut the actual person that's posting that\napplication may not be able to fix it.\n\n631\n00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,056\nI mean, let's just say, for\nkicks, this is something like,\n\n632\n00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:57,350\nI'm not picking on, I'm not saying\nthat this happens with this, but\n\n633\n00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,385\nlet's say it something like SharePoint.\n\n634\n00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:03,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> SharePoint, that's Microsoft's baby.\n\n635\n00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,200\nYou have very limited control on what\nyou can do with that to configure it.\n\n636\n00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,030\nYeah, there's a tremendous amount of\nthings you can do with Share Point.\n\n637\n00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:16,868\nBut you probably, since a lot of\nit's sealed and closed source code,\n\n638\n00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:22,458\nyou're gonna have to submit a bug report\nto Microsoft and wait for them to fix it.\n\n639\n00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,688\nSo there's gonna be a lot of,\nokay did they fix it yet?\n\n640\n00:33:25,688 --> 00:33:26,226\nOkay wait.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n641\n00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:27,265\n>> Did they do it yet?\n\n642\n00:33:27,265 --> 00:33:28,870\nNo.\nIt's gonna be a long haul.\n\n643\n00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,567\n>> Yeah, if ever right?\n\n644\n00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,490\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n645\n00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,720\n>> Because I mean, they're not gonna\ngive us access to the source code for\n\n646\n00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,720\nany program that we're paying for\nmost likely.\n\n647\n00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,460\nAnd this is not a problem with\nme hosting the application.\n\n648\n00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,370\nThe problem is in the application itself\nand the way it deals with generating and\n\n649\n00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,030\nreusing these session IDs.\n\n650\n00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,560\nSo if I don't have access\nto the source code, or\n\n651\n00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,370\naccess to the programmer that wrote the\nsource code, it's not something I can fix.\n\n652\n00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,490\nIt might be something that\nwe suggest alternatives to.\n\n653\n00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,920\nOr another application that\nmight serve the same purpose and\n\n654\n00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,200\nnot have that same vulnerability then.\n\n655\n00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,060\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n656\n00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,360\nI saw someone here put black\nsheep combats fire sheep.\n\n657\n00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,535\n>> I like that.\n\n658\n00:34:04,535 --> 00:34:06,220\n[LAUGH] Sheep wars.\n\n659\n00:34:06,220 -->

that for break time.\n\n670\n00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:26,792\n>> But\nthat has some fixations actually we use,\n\n671\n00:34:26,792 --> 00:34:30,740\nit should expire out of those things.\n\n672\n00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,680\nAnd once they expire those out,\nthen there really isn't a problem.\n\n673\n00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,313\nI can't entice someone to click on a URL,\nbut\n\n674\n00:34:38,313 --> 00:34:42,914\nit's just not gonna work if\nthat's been expired it out.\n\n675\n00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,839\nIt's going to be an invalid session, they\nwill get a message on there end doing it\n\n676\n00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,765\n>> But again, if Microsoft or whoever your\n\n677\n00:34:48,765 --> 00:34:53,843\nvendor is, if you have a closed\ndource application and you find this,\n\n678\n00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:59,522\nyou have to make the recommendation that,\nor at least note it on your report and\n\n679\n00:34:59,522 --> 00:35:04,365\ngive it to the client saying,\nI've seen this, this is a problem.\n\n680\n00:35:04,365 --> 00:35:08,809\nAnd this is, maybe these are some\nrecommendations I can do,\n\n681\n00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:13,516\nmaybe you might be able to implement\nsomething else on top of that\n\n682\n00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:16,929\nwhile the application\nhas suffers from this.\n\n683\n00:35:16,929 --> 00:35:20,454\nYou may be able to put some kind of\nencryption or something on top of it.\n\n684\n00:35:20,454 --> 00:35:24,480\nBut your hands do get a little tied.\n\n685\n00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,941\nSo that's something to think of.\n\n686\n00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:28,020\nLook at bah, bah, black sheep.\n\n687\n00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,647\n>> That's right.\n\n688\n00:35:28,647 --> 00:35:31,680\n[LAUGH] A few of them got\nthat reference I think.\n\n689\n00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,292\n>> All right!\n\n690\n00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:34,650\n>> [LAUGH] Good deal, good deal.\n\n691\n00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,836\nAll right so, we talked about\nman in the middle, or I'm sorry,\n\n692\n00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,960\nnot man in the middle, man in the browser.\n\n693\n00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,920\n>> Man in the browser.\n\n694\n00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,635\n>> For our applications.\n\n695\n00:35:41,635 --> 00:35:42,574\n>> It's easy one to mess up, by the way.\n\n696\n00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:43,150\n>> [LAUGH] It is, right?\nMan in the-\n\n697\n00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,855\n>> I'm actually glad you did that because,\n\n698\n00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,717\nwatch yourself on the exam.\n\n699\n00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:49,237\nThere is a man in the middle-\n>> I did that on purpose of course.\n\n700\n00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:50,317\n>> Yeah, that was totally scripted.\n\n701\n00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> When you go to the exam,\n\n702\n00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,275\nman in the browser, and man in the middle,\nthose are both valid attacks.\n\n703\n00:35:59,275 --> 00:36:01,120\n100% valid.\n\n704\n00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,900\nPay attention to context, because you can\nvery easily, I do the exact same thing.\n\n705\n00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:10,263\nI still have problems with it,\ngo man in the middle, man in the browser,\n\n706\n00:36:10,263 --> 00:36:11,547\nI'll be going oh, [LAUGH].\n\n707\n00:36:11,547 --> 00:36:14,910\n>> Man in the middle is the one we're used\nto, that we've had for quite some time.\n\n708\n00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,710\nThat's at the TCP level.\n\n709\n00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:19,330\n>> Yes.\n>> Whereas our man in the browser is this\n\n710\n00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:24,320\nrelatively newer form of session\nhijacking that occurs up there at\n\n711\n00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,460\nthe application level.\n\n712\n00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,900\n>> So, keep those two separated.\n\n713\n00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,483\nYes, I did that on purpose.\n\n714\n00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:29,331\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n715\n00:36:29,331 --> 00:36:31,180\n>> I was trying to see if anybody\nnoticed in the chat room.\n\n716\n00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,685\nYou all failed.\n\n717\n00:36:31,685 --> 00:36:33,280\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're doing this for your benefit,\n\n718\n00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,360\npeople.\n\n719\n00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,570\n>> It's the lag.\nOtherwise I know\n\n720\n00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,482\nyou guys would have all hammered me for\nthat one.\n\n721\n00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:38,994\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n722\n00:36:38,994 --> 00:36:41,635\n>> So, we've got man in the browser,\n\n723\n00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:44,504\nwe got our session fixation.\n>> Session fixation.\n\n724\n00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:46,182\nWe're grabbing one of those session IDs,\n\n725\n00:36:46,182 --> 00:36:49,766\nand we're fixating on it, right.\nWe want multiple people, or we want\n\n726\n00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:53,806\nour target to use that same session ID.\nAnd you said we can do that by,\n\n727\n00:36:53,806 --> 00:36:54,720\na good example,\n\n728\n00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,074\nsend him an email with a link in there.\nAnd you guys know all those different\n\n729\n00:36:58,074 --> 00:37:01,850\ntools you can use to shorten links up,\nto hide a lot of that stuff, Bitly and\n\n730\n00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,880\nother things like that,\nwhere we might not even realize.\n\n731\n00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,290\nAnother one might be predictability.\n\n732\n00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:13,040\n>> Yeah, predictability of\nsession IDs can be a bad one too.\n\n733\n00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,120\nIt is a very bad one, as a matter of fact.\n\n734\n00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,900\nWhen I look at a session ID, a session\nID should be something that when I look\n\n735\n00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,675\nat it, there's no distinguishable\npattern in there.\n\n736\n00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:27,280\nSo there's some algorithm or\n\n737\n00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,810\nsomething that's done on the web\napplication side that scrambles that.\n\n738\n00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:34,330\nThat those numbers or whatever,\nor that alphanumeric sequence,\n\n739\n00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:38,320\nwhatever, scrambles it in such a way\nthat it doesn't really mean anything.\n\n740\n00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,690\nAnd you've all seen it when\nyou've browsed around the web.\n\n741\n00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,630\nYou've seen these long\nsequences of numbers out there,\n\n742\n00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,620\nit's all some weird thing.\n\n743\n00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,500\nThat's a session ID in a lot of cases.\n\n744\n00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:53,624\n>> If you tried to extract a pattern\nfrom that, that's gonna be very tough.\n\n745\n00:37:53,624 --> 00:38:00,691\nYou might be able to do it in some\ncases but it's very, very, very tough.\n\n746\n00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:07,180\nSo what you have, if some one is not doing\nthat, that's where the problem comes in.\n\n747\n00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,110\nThat's great if someone's doing\nsomething really long and scrambled and\n\n748\n00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,790\nhas all this stuff.\n\n749\n00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,600\nYou know, hieroglyphics and\nstuff, whatever.\n\n750\n00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,886\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> It's got it in there, that's great.\n\n751\n00:38:15,886 --> 00:38:19,819\nWhere the problem comes in is if I\ncan read that and see that pattern,\n\n752\n00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:22,120\nnow I've got a big, big problem.\n\n753\n00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:27,580\nBecause what happens is that if I can see\nthat pattern, I can alter that pattern.\n\n754\n00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,920\nIf I can capture several session ID's,\n\n755\n00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,830\neven if they were things that had been\nexpired out, I can see that pattern and\n\n756\n00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,880\nI can say okay,\nthis is the next one in the sequence, and\n\n757\n00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,065\nI can guess a valid one and\nbe done with it.\n\n758\n00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:47,710\nSo you'll see things that people\ndo to create session IDs that\n\n759\n00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,390\nthey do it as shorthand and\nas a shortcut to make things easy.\n\n760\n00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,350\nAnd it turns out they're\nactually weakening security.\n\n761\n00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:01,335\nOne that you see is where\nthey use a time and date.\n\n762\n00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:05,962\nAnd they may not be,\nwhen you just look at one or two,\n\n763\n00:39:05,962 --> 00:39:08,279\nit may not be readily\nobvious what they're doing.\n\n764\n00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:12,832\nBut once you once you capture a number\nof them you can see the pattern.\n\n765\n00:39:12,832 --> 00:39:15,647\nYou can see, okay,\nthe date is staying the same or\n\n766\n00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:18,397\nthe sequence of numbers\nis staying the same, but\n\n767\n00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:23,120\nthen over here the time is changing, or\nthe sequence of numbers is changing.\n\n768\n00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,350\nYou look at it and go okay, look at\nthe clock and stuff like that, it's pretty\n\n769\n00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,040\nobvious when you're capturing stuff on\nyour screen and your clock's right there.\n\n770\n00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,580\nYou are looking at it going, oh wait\na minute, I can see a correlation here.\n\n771\n00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,900\nYou get a few more to verify it.\n\n772\n00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,300\nThen you go, okay, well, that's the time.\n\n773\n00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:41,310\nAnd then it's almost immediately,\nlike I always say, in the same zip code.\n\n774\n00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,970\nWell, that hasn't changed,\nbut, oh, that's the date.\n\n775\n00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:45,630\nNow I can see the whole thing.\n\n776\n00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,605\nYou're done.\nYou know, stick a fork in it, you're done.\n\n777\n00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:52,310\nSo, at that point you know that pattern,\nyou know date,\n\n778\n00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,760\nyou know time is what they're using.\n\n779\n00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,260\nJust create your own session ID,\nyou've got the whole format right there.\n\n780\n00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,114\n>> They make it nice and predictable for\nyou, isn't that nice of them?\n\n781\n00:40:01,114 --> 00:40:01,973\n>> Yeah.\n\n782\n00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:04,367\n>> We did have a good\nquestion out there I think,\n\n783\n00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:08,153\nJames P asked how would would a security\npro detect A hijacked session.\n\n784\n00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:12,456\nI know one of the methods is if I have\na user that's got a connection established\n\n785\n00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:14,620\nand he's calling up and saying, hey.\n\n786\n00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,320\nI keep getting disconnected.\n\n787\n00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,440\nIf I look at the server,\nI still see that the session is active.\n\n788\n00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,420\nThat's a really good indication\nthat something's going on.\n\n789\n00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,390\nThat might be one way\nyou could look at it.\n\n790\n00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,920\nWe probably have some others.\n\n791\n00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:32,060\nSome of the things that happen\nwhen we look at session IDs,\n\n792\n00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,470\none of the big problems with it is,\nit is actually very, very hard to detect.\n\n793\n00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,770\nThings like IDSes can\nhelp you out with that.\n\n794\n00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:39,120\nThey can start seeing stuff like that.\n\n795\n00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,980\nThere's actually an application-level IDS.\n\n796\n00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,010\nAll we've really talked about\nis we've talked about, or\n\n797\n00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:49,790\nwe haven't fully talked about it yet,\nwe each have that still coming.\n\n798\n00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:52,000\nWe still have the coming soon pile.\n\n799\n00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,010\nThere's host base.\n\n800\n00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,520\nYeah.\n\n801\n00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,004\nThere's host base, there's network base,\nbut there is a category of\n\n802\n00:40:57,004 --> 00:41:02,480\napplication-based ones that can look at\nstuff at the application level and start\n\n803\n00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,690\nseeing that, hey, maybe something's not\nright and start throwing warnings on it.\n\n804\n00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,880\nThe network level ones, it's questionable\nwhether or not they're gonna pick it up.\n\n805\n00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,910\nYou can also look at log files and\n\n806\n00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,240\nstuff like that to see if there's any\nsort of access that's kind of strange.\n\n807\n00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,870\nYeah, so\nthere's a handful of things you can do.\n\n808\n00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,360\nBut a lot of it is just\nreally on the proactive side.\n\n809\n00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:31,440\nYou have to put the defenses in place\nbecause you think about some of\n\n810\n00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,600\nthese things that would happen, like you\njust mentioned, what if a session's idle,\n\n811\n00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,670\nsomeone had an active session, and now\n\n812\n00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,960\nthey're not connected and\nthat thing's sitting up there.\n\n813\n00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,470\nOr they have a connection that's active.\n\n814\n00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,390\nDo those type of things happen?\n\n815\n00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,870\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Yeah, they do happen under\n\n816\n00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:52,310\nnormal circumstances.\n\n817\n00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:58,590\nAnother one that's mentioned is what\nhappens if someone has a connection and\n\n818\n00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,070\nsomeone else has\na connection to the server.\n\n819\n00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,580\nI jump in, take it over and\ndo something, they're disconnected.\n\n820\n00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,300\nAre they immediately gonna say,\noh, it's a session hijack?\n\n821\n00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:08,900\nNo.\n>> Yeah, they'll\n\n822\n00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,950\nprobably try to connect again, or\ntry to figure out what's wrong themselves.\n\n823\n00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,530\nIf it's a Windows machine\nthey're gonna reboot.\n\n824\n00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,610\nYou know, that kind of thing.\n\n825\n00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,640\n>> That's exactly it is\nwhat's gonna happen.\n\n826\n00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,190\nIf someone's gonna look at that at a whole\n\n827\n00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:25,610\nhost of other things than\na session hijack, you know?\n\n828\n00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:29,250\nBecause saying that you've\nlost connectivity to a server,\n\n829\n00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,620\nlet's say we're talking client-server and\nI've taken that over.\n\n830\n00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:36,930\nSaying you've lost connectivity to\na server is not an unusual situation\n\n831\n00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:39,420\nby any stretch of the imagination.\n\n832\n00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:45,290\nSo, you're gonna do the typical\nthings to go through and\n\n833\n00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,240\nresolve that that you've\nbeen trained to do.\n\n834\n00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,668\nLike you said, the reboot,\nto right-click and\n\n835\n00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:52,710\ndo the troubleshoot the network\nconnection, things like that.\n\n836\n00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,020\nTry to reconnect.\n\n837\n00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,930\nIf those don't work, for whatever reason,\nthe next step is to call the help desk.\n\n838\n00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,500\nThe help desk is not\ngonna immediately say oh,\n\n839\n00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,385\nyou've been the victim\nof a session hijack.\n\n840\n00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:04,500\nNo.\n\n841\n00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,180\nThe only time, quite honestly, the only\ntime I've ever seen people at the help\n\n842\n00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:13,780\ndesk make that statement, or people on\nthe client side make that statement,\n\n843\n00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,622\nis that they've recently\nbeen through a CEH class.\n\n844\n00:43:16,622 --> 00:43:19,560\nAnd they're just like,\noh, now I know about it.\n\n845\n00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,792\nIt's like, no. [SOUND] >> [CROSSTALK]\n>> No, it's not that at all.\n\n846\n00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:25,085\nThey just heard about it and\nthey're panicking.\n\n847\n00:43:25,085 --> 00:43:27,505\nThey're doing the whole\nsky is falling stuff.\n\n848\n00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:30,043\n.\nIt's that Occam's razor thing,\n\n849\n00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:33,235\nthe simplest answer, or\nwhatever, type thing.\n\n850\n00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:35,505\nThat's what's happening here.\n\n851\n00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:37,025\nIt's probably not a session hijack,\n\n852\n00:43:37,025 --> 00:43:41,289\nor they're gonna assume\nit's not a session hijack.\n\n853\n00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:49,390\nThe thing is, if it is a session\nhijack they got disconnected for,\n\n854\n00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:53,040\nwhy they're going through all\nthe typical troubleshooting steps,\n\n855\n00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,660\nwhat's gonna happen is that\nI'm gonna be doing my thing.\n\n856\n00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,590\nI've got the information I want.\n\n857\n00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,800\nI'm gone.\n\n858\n00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,670\nBy the time you find it out,\nthat attack is dead.\n\n859\n00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:05,488\nSp it's more than likely you're\nnot gonna pick it up, or\n\n860\n00:44:05,488 --> 00:44:07,920\nyou're gonna pick it\nup when it's too late.\n\n861\n00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,770\nAnd even if you find the remains\nof a successful hijack\n\n862\n00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,320\nor come on the scene after a successful\nsession hijack, what are you gonna see?\n\n863\n00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,380\nYou're gonna see some\nstuff in a log file and\n\n864\n00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,240\nthere's gonna be some forensics and\nall that going on.\n\n865\n00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,320\nAnd it's gonna take a while.\n\n866\n00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,600\n>> Right, to try to trace that back,\ntry to figure out where it came from.\n\n867\n00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:27,825\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's even if they do that.\n\n868\n00:44:27,825 --> 00:44:29,310\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n869\n00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,490\nAnother good question we had out there.\n\n870\n00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:35,020\nWould it be a good idea, Fabian asked,\nwould it be a good idea to do URL masking?\n\n871\n00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,650\nAnd I'm not the IIS guy or\nthe web design guy.\n\n872\n00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,500\nNow, from what I understand, depending on\nhow they've read the webpage, they can do\n\n873\n00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:48,080\nHTTP gets, HTTP posts, different ways\nI can submit data to this website.\n\n874\n00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,700\nBut you can mass it.\n\n875\n00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,262\nYou don't have to include that stuff.\n\n876\n00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:54,675\nTthere's different ways that we could\ndo it where the information is not\n\n877\n00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:59,125\nvisible right there in the URL\n>> Yeah, I think that that is a fair\n\n878\n00:44:59,125 --> 00:45:04,005\ndefensive strategy to use,\nis to use something like URL masking.\n\n879\n00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:05,615\nYou can definitely use that.\n\n880\n00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,815\nYou can use all sorts of\nthings to scramble that,\n\n881\n00:45:07,815 --> 00:45:12,210\nanything that really scrambles that ID and\n\n882\n00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:16,125\nkeeps it from being easily observed or\nintercepted, is gonna be a plus.\n\n883\n00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:17,090\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n884\n00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:19,480\nAbsolutely, absolutely, and\nI saw another one here.\n\n885\n00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,090\nIf someone reconnects,\nwould it mess up the hijack session?\n\n886\n00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:25,550\nHow about that?\n\n887\n00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:27,760\n>> Usually no.\n\n888\n00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,360\nIt all depends on the situation.\n\n889\n00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:34,990\nIf you think about it,\nthere's some applications where if I\n\n890\n00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,690\nwere to take over your session and\nyou went to reconnect, what's it gonna do?\n\n891\n00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,950\nIt creates a new session for you.\n\n892\n00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:40,680\n>> Right.\n\n893\n00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:43,715\nAnd if the application was written\nto only allow a single connection,\n\n894\n00:45:43,715 --> 00:45:47,405\nlike maybe the application identified\nyou somehow, had to authenticate to\n\n895\n00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:50,360\nthe application itself, and\nit could keep track of who you are and\n\n896\n00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,895\nit might not allow multiple sessions from\nthe same user ID, or something like that.\n\n897\n00:45:54,895 --> 00:45:56,925\nThen maybe that would cause a problem.\n\n898\n00:45:56,925 --> 00:45:58,855\nOtherwise, most systems\nare just gonna treat it like,\n\n899\n00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:00,575\noh, here's another connection.\n\n900\n00:46:00,575 --> 00:46:03,955\nJust like I can open up two\nInternet Explorers on my computer and\n\n901\n00:46:03,955 --> 00:46:09,570\nI can connect to Newegg from both browser\nwindows, and Newegg doesn't care, right?\n\n902\n00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:10,990\nSo in that case, no.\n\n903\n00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,340\nSo if I had logged into something, and\nsomebody takes that over to the server,\n\n904\n00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,220\nit's just me still authenticated to that\nsite, I go to open up another browser and\n\n905\n00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,450\nestablish a second connection,\nand I could authenticate again.\n\n906\n00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,828\nSo, in most cases, no.\n\n907\n00:46:22,828 --> 00:46:25,619\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n908\n00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,463\n>> All right.\n\n909\n00:46:26,463 --> 00:46:29,110\n>> All right, well, I'll tell you what,\nlooking at the clock,\n\n910\n00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,830\nit's getting close to our break time,\nso why don't we stop here?\n\n911\n00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,513\nWe've still got some more types of\napplication session hijacking that we're\n\n912\n00:46:35,513 --> 00:46:37,196\ngonna talk about when we come back.\n\n913\n00:46:37,196 --> 00:46:39,278\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n914\n00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:45,901\n[MUSIC]\n\n915\n00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:48,082\n[SOUND] All right, welcome,\nback ladies and gentlemen,\n\n916\n00:46:48,082 --> 00:46:49,453\nto our Session Hijacking episode.\n\n917\n00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:50,589\nSo continuing on,\n\n918\n00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:54,991\nwe were talking about some of the\ndifferent types of session hijacking and\n\n919\n00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:59,468\nspecifically, session hijacking that\noccurs at the application layer.\n\n920\n00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:04,350\nAnd I think we're getting ready\nto talk about, what, Trojans?\n\n921\n00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:06,000\n>> Yes, we do need to talk about that.\n\n922\n00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,860\nOr at least revisit it.\n\n923\n00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,060\nWe have had our big discussion\nin a previous lesson.\n\n924\n00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:14,050\nBut they do come into play\nlike all these tools.\n\n925\n00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:16,655\nIt's just a matter of how you deploy them.\n\n926\n00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:22,195\nWe introduce you to them, and a lot of\nthe tools we see in here are actually\n\n927\n00:47:22,195 --> 00:47:26,825\nquite simple on the surface, and that's\nthe way we kinda wanna present them, is\n\n928\n00:47:26,825 --> 00:47:31,800\nthat they don't need to be all mystified,\nthis black magic and everything like that.\n\n929\n00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,630\nWhat we want you to do is we want you\nto look a little closer at how you\n\n930\n00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,350\ncould use them and put them together with\nother things to carry out other attacks.\n\n931\n00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:43,940\nAnd this is a case where one of those\nthings is coming back yet again,\n\n932\n00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,060\nis we can use the trojan as\nanother way to grab a session ID.\n\n933\n00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:52,725\nAnd what we can do is we\ncan deploy a trojan and\n\n934\n00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:56,505\nhave it deploy onto a system, something\nthat actually observes connections.\n\n935\n00:47:56,505 --> 00:47:59,945\nAnd we talked about monitoring\nsoftware and stuff like that.\n\n936\n00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:04,747\nNow we're doing the exact same thing, is\nthat we're using it to deploy monitoring\n\n937\n00:48:04,747 --> 00:48:09,616\nsoftware But that monitoring software is\ngoing to, you know, look, is gonna loo,\n\n938\n00:48:09,616 --> 00:48:13,630\nin this case we tailored specifically\nto look for session IDs.\n\n939\n00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:18,650\nIn fact, you know, to get a drill, a drill\ndown to it, you could use even Trojans,\n\n940\n00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,180\nyou can even spyware as a way to do this.\n\n941\n00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,080\n>> All right.\n\n942\n00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,570\n>> To deploy something onto\na system that's gonna look for,\n\n943\n00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,940\nthat's gonna look for those URLs\n>> Right.\n\n944\n00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,020\n>> That's all we're doing,\nis that we're trying to get,\n\n945\n00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:33,270\nis we're trying to capture information,\nso when you break it down to that,\n\n946\n00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,180\na session ID is just\na piece of information.\n\n947\n00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:39,885\nWe can use, anything that we have so\nfar that can be used to do that.\n\n948\n00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:44,055\nWe can deploy to a system, we can bundle\nup in a trojan, and drop it out there.\n\n949\n00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:45,175\n>> Right, so just another method.\n\n950\n00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:48,625\nSo it's not necessarily that Trojans,\nthere's a method of session hijacking\n\n951\n00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:54,620\nitself, but Trojans as a, it's a good way\nto say, it's a means to get the tools\n\n952\n00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:59,440\nwe need to do a recession hijacking on\nthat other system, it's a delivery method.\n\n953\n00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,180\n>> Yeah, exactly, you know, absolutely.\n\n954\n00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,900\n>> Just like we talk about with session\nfixation, we could do a fishing email so\n\n955\n00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,340\nthe email would have been\nour delivery method for\n\n956\n00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,630\n>> I'm gonna try to get them to click on\n\n957\n00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,350\nthis link or something.\n\n958\n00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,010\n>> Absolutely.\n\n959\n00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,720\n>> Alright some other things,\n\n960\n00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,300\nyou know JavaScript's another one that\ncan be taken advantage of, right?\n\n961\n00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:25,690\n>> Yeah JavaScript is an old language,\nit's a very well known language.\n\n962\n00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,690\nAnd, you know, and\nthose things all make it a very,\n\n963\n00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,080\nvery good tool for\nyou to grab session IDs.\n\n964\n00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,100\nReally you can use JavaScript, or\nfor that matter there's VBScript and\n\n965\n00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,750\nother stuff you can use-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n966\n00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,652\n>> To access different parts of\nthe browser and get this information.\n\n967\n00:49:39,652 --> 00:49:44,570\nSo JavaScript is an effective tool for\ngrabbing session IDs.\n\n968\n00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,860\nWhat you can do is a session\nID is generated it,\n\n969\n00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,600\nthen sent down to the client.\n\n970\n00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,440\nJava script runs on the client so\n\n971\n00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,430\nyou can construct something in Java Script\nto actually grab that session ID and\n\n972\n00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:58,330\neither write to a cookie\nthat you can retrieve later.\n\n973\n00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:02,710\nThat's entirely possible, in fact you can\nread a cookie through Java Script as well\n\n974\n00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,860\nso I could write something and\nthis is just one way of doing it.\n\n975\n00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:10,330\nI could write a session ID to a cookie and\nthen use script to actually extract\n\n976\n00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,895\nthe information out of it and\nsend it back some place else to me.\n\n977\n00:50:12,895 --> 00:50:17,480\nSo entirely possible to carry\nout something like that.\n\n978\n00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,890\nIn fact Java Script can be\nused in more advanced attacks,\n\n979\n00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,740\nwhich we are going to be talking about\nmore as we go on to web applications and\n\n980\n00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:29,830\nthe web servers and stuff like that is,\ncross eyed scripting.\n\n981\n00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:32,780\nCross eyed scripting is\nsomething we're going to\n\n982\n00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,190\ndo our formal introduction later on.\n\n983\n00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:39,250\nBut cross eye scripting can\ndefinitely be used to grab\n\n984\n00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,570\nsession IDs off a system amongst\na lot of other things, too.\n\n985\n00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:44,390\n>> Right.\n\n986\n00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,800\nSo, there's a lot of possibilities there,\na lot of power in that language.\n\n987\n00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,610\nAnd like I said, job descript has been\naround for so long, it really hasn't\n\n988\n00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:57,100\nundergone that many changes, it's, it's,\nit's, yeah, it's undergone changes\n\n989\n00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,440\nover the years, but it's not only that\n>> I was going to say, that dang thing\n\n990\n00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,290\nblinks at me all the time, there's\na java script update, or there's java.\n\n991\n00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:06,140\nIt's not really that they're\nupdating the language, right?\n\n992\n00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,335\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or I mean the actual [INAUDIBLE]\n\n993\n00:51:08,335 --> 00:51:11,790\n>> Yeah, the interpreters may have just\n\n994\n00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:17,190\na few closed bugs and defects and\nstuff like that, but the language itself\n\n995\n00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:23,490\nreally isn't like night and day compared\nto what it was a few years ago.\n\n996\n00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:26,680\nIt's, you can see a definite\nprogression of it in a few things,\n\n997\n00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:31,310\nand functions added here or there,\nwhich those of you that are developers or\n\n998\n00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:33,940\nwork with job script can\nprobably attest to pretty easily.\n\n999\n00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:38,480\nSaying ya it looks,\nit really hasn't changed all that much.\n\n1000\n00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,180\n>> Ya the scripting language itself has\nhad additions to support features and\n\n1001\n00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,970\nthings like that, but\nin the end it's still.\n\n1002\n00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,770\nJavaScript, so.\n\n1003\n00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,140\n>> Yeah.\n\n1004\n00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:46,920\n>> All right.\nSo, you know,\n\n1005\n00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,700\nwe talked about a few different\nways we can do session hijacking.\n\n1006\n00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:51,570\nI mean we've got the,\nat the network layer,\n\n1007\n00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:56,150\nwhere we're taking advantage of, TCP- IP,\nin particular, and TCP, and those session,\n\n1008\n00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,760\nI mean the sequence numbers,\nrying to do some predictability on that.\n\n1009\n00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,150\nWe also have session hijacking that\noccurs up at the application layer.\n\n1010\n00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,010\nWhere we're dealing with the applications,\nand\n\n1011\n00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:12,150\nwe got things like man in the browser,\nsession fixation, predictability.\n\n1012\n00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:15,310\nWe saw, we can use trojan\nhorses as a delivery method for\n\n1013\n00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:18,320\nmay be trying to obtain some\nof those session i.d.'s.\n\n1014\n00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:22,200\nAs well as using JavaScript to grab\nthose session IDs whether we're grabbing\n\n1015\n00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,460\nthe cookie or from their session itself\nthat they got going on in that browser.\n\n1016\n00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,010\nSo scary stuff what can we\ndo to defend against it and\n\n1017\n00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:37,232\nif I want to try to, to protect myself and\nmy users from this session hijacking.\n\n1018\n00:52:37,232 --> 00:52:40,660\n>> Well, what you've first gotta do is you\ngotta figure out what category you in,\n\n1019\n00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,700\nwhat you want to defend against.\n\n1020\n00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,060\nSo, is it network or application?\n\n1021\n00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,840\nAs we were mentioning it's gotta\nbe in one of those two areas.\n\n1022\n00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,600\nSo, once it's in one of those where\nyou determine what area it's in,\n\n1023\n00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,485\nthat's gonna defend that's gonna\ndetermine your defensive strategy.\n\n1024\n00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:55,200\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1025\n00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,390\n>> On the network side we have things\nlike SSL, TLS to mention a couple.\n\n1026\n00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,265\nAnd then we even have another one, IPSec.\n\n1027\n00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:04,140\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1028\n00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,300\n>> IPSec is something that's\navailable across platforms and\n\n1029\n00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:13,390\nsomething you can use to encrypt IP\ntraffic or digitally sign IP traffic.\n\n1030\n00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:17,470\nBoth will actually work to defend\nagainst session hijacking.\n\n1031\n00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:19,280\nI mean if you encrypt\nit they can't read it.\n\n1032\n00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,030\nAnd if it's digitally signed by\nan individual someone else can't use it.\n\n1033\n00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:27,770\nSo it does,\nit does make it a very good defense\n\n1034\n00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:32,180\nif you can go through the configuration\nprocess and get that set up.\n\n1035\n00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,870\n>> Yeah.\n>> IP SEC's also really good in those\n\n1036\n00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,700\ncases where you might\nbe using something that\n\n1037\n00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,215\nat the application level that\nyou can't protect any other way.\n\n1038\n00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:44,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You could actually use IPsec to provide\n\n1039\n00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:48,450\nthat level of encryption, saying,\nconnections to port A, or\n\n1040\n00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:50,650\nport whatever are gonna be encrypted.\n\n1041\n00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:51,290\n>> All right.\n\n1042\n00:53:51,290 --> 00:53:54,580\n>> So you do, you, it's, so you can,\nyou can combine this tool, you can\n\n1043\n00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:58,400\ncombine this tool with other technology to\nprovide protection that just isn't there.\n\n1044\n00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,400\nLike you said IP4\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1045\n00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,540\n>> There's no protection there.\n\n1046\n00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,260\n>> There's nothing.\n\n1047\n00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,220\n>> But we can use ipsec to provide that.\n\n1048\n00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,430\n>> And that is nice because\nas you're saying it's,\n\n1049\n00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:08,050\nit's transparent to the application,\nright?\n\n1050\n00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,610\nThe, the ipsec encryption and\n\n1051\n00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:14,320\ndecryption occurs well below\nthe application on that OSI model.\n\n1052\n00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,820\nSo if you've got an application that\ndoesn't understand encryption or\n\n1053\n00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,840\nyou can't implement SSL or\nsomething like that.\n\n1054\n00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,200\nThere's another some,\nsome other constraints.\n\n1055\n00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,070\nIPsec fits nicely because the application\ndoes not have to understand it.\n\n1056\n00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:31,420\nIt occurs down at the bottom of the stack\nand then it's decrypted on the way up\n\n1057\n00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:34,420\nthe stack on the other side,\nwell before the application gets it.\n\n1058\n00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,745\nSo you can use it with any application.\n\n1059\n00:54:35,745 --> 00:54:36,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1060\n00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,380\nYeah, yeah.\nYou know,\n\n1061\n00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,780\nabsolutely that's a huge benefit to that-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1062\n00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,378\n>> Is that it's, it's cross-platform,\n\n1063\n00:54:42,378 --> 00:54:46,060\ncross-application\n>> I mean you can use IPsec on everything,\n\n1064\n00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,080\nfrom mobile devices to tablets to\nyou know, eh, to, to, desktop and\n\n1065\n00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:50,990\nlaptop computers.\n\n1066\n00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,880\nIt's right across the board.\n\n1067\n00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,880\nAnd so, it's going to provide a broad\nBase protection which, is, is, is,\n\n1068\n00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,490\nis ,is very very cool.\n\n1069\n00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:03,380\n>> Yeah, and that's why it's in IPV6\nbecause it is so independent and,\n\n1070\n00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,540\nand everything works with it, so-\n>> Yeah, that's a good point to make\n\n1071\n00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,970\nactually, because we, we mentioned with\nIP4 and IP6 the no security vs security.\n\n1072\n00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,240\nIPSX required an IP6 you,\nyou have to have it.\n\n1073\n00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,440\n>> IP4, it's, it's optional.\n\n1074\n00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,720\n>> You know, so it's, it's,\n\n1075\n00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:24,060\nyou know, it works much better\nin IP6 than it does in IP4.\n\n1076\n00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,250\nThe IP6 is built in IP4, you know,\n\n1077\n00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,222\nthey kinda said,\nget me a big roll of duct tape.\n\n1078\n00:55:29,222 --> 00:55:30,096\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And stick it on.\n\n1079\n00:55:30,096 --> 00:55:33,230\nYou know, that's kinda the difference\nyou know they can't say.\n\n1080\n00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,560\n>> Right, it gets the job done but\nit's not elegant, is it?\n\n1081\n00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,590\n>> Yeah it's factory installed.\n\n1082\n00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,450\nIgnore the tape, it's factory installed.\n\n1083\n00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:44,040\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it still works, not to downgrade it.\n\n1084\n00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:44,918\nIt still works.\n\n1085\n00:55:44,918 --> 00:55:45,759\n>> It still works, that's the job.\n\n1086\n00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,900\n>> So\nwhatever we can do to encrypt the traffic.\n\n1087\n00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:49,660\nIt might be a good way\nto defend against this.\n\n1088\n00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,622\nBecause again we're either making it\nto where they can't read the data in\n\n1089\n00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:53,210\nthat packet.\n\n1090\n00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:57,218\nOr even if its just digitally signed,\nany type of tampering with that packet Or\n\n1091\n00:55:57,218 --> 00:56:01,001\nreuse of that package should become\napparent if it's digitally signed.\n\n1092\n00:56:01,001 --> 00:56:04,160\nSo a couple of things we can\ndo to protect against that.\n\n1093\n00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,780\nAnd we can also work up at the application\nlayer or the application, I shouldn't say\n\n1094\n00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:13,215\napplication layer, but the application\nitself to give us some sort of protection.\n\n1095\n00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:16,845\n>> Yes.\nYou can bump up to the application,\n\n1096\n00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:19,685\nyou've got a lot of things at this point.\n\n1097\n00:56:19,685 --> 00:56:22,405\nI mean, just like we have a good\nnumber of attacks to do session\n\n1098\n00:56:22,405 --> 00:56:25,920\nhijacking at the application level.\n\n1099\n00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,910\nWe also have a good number of\nways to defend against that.\n\n1100\n00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:34,510\nSome of them require that you're developer\nto implement, other ones, not so much.\n\n1101\n00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:41,220\nWe've already introduced SSL,\nTLS and IPSAC those are three\n\n1102\n00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:46,000\ntools in your arsenal that are available\nto you, ready to go right off the bat.\n\n1103\n00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,828\nBut there are other things too\nthat you should observe and\n\n1104\n00:56:49,828 --> 00:56:53,266\nconsider if you find\nyourself vulnerable to them.\n\n1105\n00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:57,027\nOne of them is the predictability\nof session IDs.\n\n1106\n00:56:57,027 --> 00:56:59,470\nThat should be easily fixed.\n\n1107\n00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,750\nYou should be able to\nconfigure your application so\n\n1108\n00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:06,000\nit doesn't use those\npredictable session IDs.\n\n1109\n00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,450\nYou should able to say, okay, well,\nthe session ID, it looks very predictable,\n\n1110\n00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:15,370\nI can figure what's going on,\nthere's definitely a pattern here.\n\n1111\n00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:18,090\nWell, I'm gonna make\nthe session IDs longer and\n\n1112\n00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:22,630\nI'm gonna introduce some entropy or\nsome randomness into that so\n\n1113\n00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:27,070\nthat doesn't happen so\nyou don't have any issues.\n\n1114\n00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,840\nThat would be a big one.\n\n1115\n00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,760\nYou may have to consult\nwith the developer for\n\n1116\n00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,720\nthat though that's one\nof the big problems.\n\n1117\n00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:37,840\n>> Right, yeah, that's an issue that\nwe run into is if it's not an in-house\n\n1118\n00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,400\ndeveloped application, there might or\nmight not be some options that I can\n\n1119\n00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:45,500\nconfigure within that application,\nwhatever the developer side produced.\n\n1120\n00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:50,290\nSo, if I didn't write it myself or it's\nnot written internally or somebody that I\n\n1121\n00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,398\npaid, a contractor to write this, I might\nnot have access to that source code.\n\n1122\n00:57:54,398 --> 00:57:57,630\nI might not have any course\nof action that I can take\n\n1123\n00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:01,488\nto get them to make changes\nto their actual program.\n\n1124\n00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:05,710\nSo that's gonna be a limited by\nthe program that you're using there.\n\n1125\n00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:08,830\nBut if you just look at the different\ntypes of vulnerabilities that we face with\n\n1126\n00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:11,520\nthe application layer\nthey're kinda lead you to\n\n1127\n00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,580\nwhat I might do to defend against it.\n\n1128\n00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:16,960\nLike Sean said, if it's predictability\nthat we're having an issue with,\n\n1129\n00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:19,610\ndon't make it so predictable, all right?\n\n1130\n00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:25,090\nYeah, if it's session fixation that\nkinda comes back to user education, not\n\n1131\n00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:29,246\ngetting them to click on things in emails,\nsome other things we could do there.\n\n1132\n00:58:29,246 --> 00:58:33,550\n>> There's definitely that, a part of\nit that's a security awareness part to\n\n1133\n00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:37,140\nmake sure that they know not to\nclick on these types of things.\n\n1134\n00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,600\nBut there is something else we can do,\nthis is a good one.\n\n1135\n00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,617\nThere's something else we can do,\n\n1136\n00:58:41,617 --> 00:58:45,324\nif we look at the mechanics of what\nmakes a session fixation work.\n\n1137\n00:58:45,324 --> 00:58:49,897\nSession fixation is, we said we've\ncaptured a previously used ID.\n\n1138\n00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:50,442\n>> Sort of used ones.\n\n1139\n00:58:50,442 --> 00:58:51,634\n>> And causing someone.\n\n1140\n00:58:51,634 --> 00:58:53,340\nYeah, it should be expired out.\n\n1141\n00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,950\nIt should be something that\nhas a limited time frame or\n\n1142\n00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:59,996\nwhen that session's closed that\nsession ID is gone as well.\n\n1143\n00:58:59,996 --> 00:59:04,010\nSo those would be really\ngood protection against it\n\n1144\n00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:08,590\nin addition to the stuff we just mentioned\nand the stuff that's suggesting,\n\n1145\n00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,990\nthat would be even more general.\n\n1146\n00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:15,280\nThat would be something that we want\npeople to do anyway, even outside of this.\n\n1147\n00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:15,959\n>> Right.\n>> But yeah,\n\n1148\n00:59:15,959 --> 00:59:19,530\nit's also gonna add in a level of\nprotection against session hijacking.\n\n1149\n00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,510\nSo, going through and saying okay,\n\n1150\n00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:26,000\nwell, configure the application\nno reusing session IDs,\n\n1151\n00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,580\nthey expire out a certain period of time,\nare gonna be great defenses against that.\n\n1152\n00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:35,530\nUsually, you can configure that in the\nconsole or through a script or something\n\n1153\n00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,960\nfor a web app but again, in some cases,\nyou might actually have to, especially\n\n1154\n00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,940\nhome grown applications, you might\nhave to go into the code to fix that.\n\n1155\n00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,751\n>> And that is one of the things I've\noperate a couple of applications here and\n\n1156\n00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,763\nthere but I mean, you're ahead of me.\n\n1157\n00:59:50,763 --> 00:59:52,574\n>> [LAUGH] I didn't do it,\nthere was no security at all.\n\n1158\n00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:56,028\nI mean, I was just trying to hopefully\nsuccessfully write the application and\n\n1159\n00:59:56,028 --> 00:59:56,822\nhave it install.\n\n1160\n00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:58,275\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Baby steps, right?\n\n1161\n00:59:58,275 --> 00:59:59,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, baby steps, exactly.\n\n1162\n00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:03,900\nNot meant for a production environment or\nfor sale or anything like that and\n\n1163\n01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,170\nthat's one of the risks you run into.\n\n1164\n01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,920\nCompanies will try to say,\nwe're gonna save a little money,\n\n1165\n01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,600\nget this developed in-house, I got this\nguy who's really good with JavaScript or\n\n1166\n01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,670\nreally good with VBA or\nsomething like that or\n\n1167\n01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:20,394\ncreating these web apps, but do they\nreally understand it at this level, right?\n\n1168\n01:00:20,394 --> 01:00:22,890\nIs this something that I want\nto implement in my network\n\n1169\n01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:27,480\nthat could open up a whole new set of\nvulnerabilities, so gotta pay attention to\n\n1170\n01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:31,460\nthe applications that we're using and the\nvulnerabilities that they're bringing in.\n\n1171\n01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,342\nSo you got to be careful with that.\n\n1172\n01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:35,970\n>> Yeah, unfortunately even\nif your someone that's new to\n\n1173\n01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:40,430\ndeveloping an application the tools\nare getting better, I don't know,\n\n1174\n01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,745\nwhen you were doing\nyour application stuff.\n\n1175\n01:00:42,745 --> 01:00:46,230\nBut the tools are getting\nbetter where they can help you\n\n1176\n01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:49,240\npick up some of these things\nif you're a new guy to coding.\n\n1177\n01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,820\nBut still, I mean that's still a kind of,\n\n1178\n01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,910\nI'm not, I don't wanna be mean and\nsay it's a crutch but\n\n1179\n01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,290\nI'm gonna say it's something that\nyou shouldn't just say okay, I don't\n\n1180\n01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:04,160\nhave to concentrate on that because\nthe development environment's got that.\n\n1181\n01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:08,731\nNo, there's still responsibility on your\npart to make sure that doesn't happen\n\n1182\n01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:12,854\nbecause those things still are not\nthe level where they're infallible.\n\n1183\n01:01:12,854 --> 01:01:17,194\nNeither are we, we need to work together\nnot say that is yours and this is this.\n\n1184\n01:01:17,194 --> 01:01:19,758\n>> Right, right, yep,\ndon't rely on that kind of stuff.\n\n1185\n01:01:19,758 --> 01:01:20,898\n>> Yeah.\n\n1186\n01:01:20,898 --> 01:01:25,788\n>> So there are some ways in the end\nthat we can defend against these session\n\n1187\n01:01:25,788 --> 01:01:28,582\nhijackings, dangerous stuff though.\n\n1188\n01:01:28,582 --> 01:01:31,190\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1189\n01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:34,420\nAnd some of the other stuff we have,\nI mean we talked about Trojans and\n\n1190\n01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,060\nthings like that.\n\n1191\n01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,600\nI don't think I need to really\nkind of tell anybody at this point\n\n1192\n01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,780\nas far as how do you\ndefend against a Trojan.\n\n1193\n01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:46,830\nIt's straightforward, that's malware,\nwe've already got defenses against that.\n\n1194\n01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:53,362\nThere's nothing specific to\nan application that's gonna stop that.\n\n1195\n01:01:53,362 --> 01:01:57,248\nIt something where you have\nan anti-malware stuff on your system and\n\n1196\n01:01:57,248 --> 01:01:59,665\nit stops that from occurring, done deal.\n\n1197\n01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:00,292\n>> Right.\n\n1198\n01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:06,150\n>> And as far as that last one with\nJavaScript, JavaScript that's your call.\n\n1199\n01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:12,510\nI know there's some people out there\nthat will, I'm not one of them.\n\n1200\n01:02:12,510 --> 01:02:18,960\nRemember we talked about way back in\nour first, very first episode for CEH.\n\n1201\n01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:23,310\nWe talked about that distinction\nbetween security and convenience.\n\n1202\n01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:27,840\nSecurity and convenience, you've got\nto figure out where that line is.\n\n1203\n01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,349\nI know some people will say, well,\nJavaScript is a security problem,\n\n1204\n01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:33,172\nI'm gonna turn it off on my browser.\n\n1205\n01:02:33,172 --> 01:02:37,260\nWell, good luck enjoying\nyour web as it was in 95.\n\n1206\n01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:38,664\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1207\n01:02:38,664 --> 01:02:41,159\n>> It's just horrible.\n\n1208\n01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:42,541\n>> There's a lot that relies on it.\n\n1209\n01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,064\n>> Yeah.\n\n1210\n01:02:43,064 --> 01:02:45,831\n>> A lot of things that we might not\neven realize we're using JavaScript in\n\n1211\n01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:46,530\nthe background.\n\n1212\n01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:50,510\nAll of a sudden, you turn it off and you\nfeel safe but a lot of things are broke.\n\n1213\n01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:57,020\n>> Yeah, it doesn't work and\nI'm not one to really argue with that.\n\n1214\n01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,390\nIf someone wants to do that, that's fine.\n\n1215\n01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:04,089\nI know one, not picking on him at all but\none of the experts in this field,\n\n1216\n01:03:04,089 --> 01:03:07,631\nSteve Gibson, he does that,\nhe's big on doing that,\n\n1217\n01:03:07,631 --> 01:03:10,690\nhe'll say turn off all the active content.\n\n1218\n01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,050\n>> Right.\n\n1219\n01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:16,252\n>> Hey, Steve wants to do that, he can\ndo that, I am not gonna argue with him.\n\n1220\n01:03:16,252 --> 01:03:17,472\nI mean, he's got a valid point.\n\n1221\n01:03:17,472 --> 01:03:19,576\n>> Yeah.\n>> He's very safe that way and\n\n1222\n01:03:19,576 --> 01:03:22,330\nhe's okay with that level of convenience.\n\n1223\n01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:26,820\nI think in his case, he turns off all the\nactive content when he goes to a website\n\n1224\n01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,469\nhe likes, he turns it all,\nhe turns the stuff on and reloads it.\n\n1225\n01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:31,750\n>> Right.\n>> He's okay with that,\n\n1226\n01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,075\nit's not my browser.\n\n1227\n01:03:34,075 --> 01:03:36,170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In my case, okay,\n\n1228\n01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:38,033\nI'm just gonna leave it on.\n\n1229\n01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:41,907\nI know there's risks with it but\nI'm willing to accept that level of risk.\n\n1230\n01:03:41,907 --> 01:03:43,437\n>> Yeah.\n>> He isn't, I am,\n\n1231\n01:03:43,437 --> 01:03:46,510\nit doesn't mean either one of us is wrong.\n\n1232\n01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:47,320\n>> All right.\n\n1233\n01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,732\nThere's different ways of\ndoing risk management,\n\n1234\n01:03:49,732 --> 01:03:53,033\ndeciding whether that particular\nmitigation strategy works for you.\n\n1235\n01:03:53,033 --> 01:03:56,820\nI kinda agree, I'm not gonna want to have\nto turn that on every page that I go to,\n\n1236\n01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:58,136\nif I really like that page.\n\n1237\n01:03:58,136 --> 01:04:01,265\nBut, I like my moving stuff and\nall that active content.\n\n1238\n01:04:01,265 --> 01:04:03,244\nThat's what makes Makes the web exciting,\nbut [CROSSTALK]\n\n1239\n01:04:03,244 --> 01:04:05,460\n>> But as Brian brings up in here.\n\n1240\n01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,285\nFor people like us that are deciding\nthat we don't wanna turn that off.\n\n1241\n01:04:10,285 --> 01:04:11,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1242\n01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,460\n>> We've got these no script add-ons and\nstuff like that.\n\n1243\n01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:15,010\n>> Mm-hm. Mm-hm.\n>> We click a button on the tool bar.\n\n1244\n01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:17,490\nI've used some of those myself.\n\n1245\n01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,390\nThey're not, it's not a bad thing.\n\n1246\n01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,894\nI don't know,\nmaybe that's what Steve's using.\n\n1247\n01:04:20,894 --> 01:04:22,330\nI don't know.\n>> That very well could be.\n\n1248\n01:04:22,330

--> 01:04:43,310\nBut to me, it doesn't matter all that\nmuch, but [LAUGH] that's just me.\n\n1256\n01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,590\nI know, I'm crazy like that.\n\n1257\n01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,800\n>> Every browser has its issues, right?\n\n1258\n01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,940\nSo as long as you're aware of it.\n\n1259\n01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:52,565\nYou're not an average user,

thing we have with,\nfrom the real world,\n\n1274\n01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:35,800\nI wanna put in is that you never know\nwho's gonna be vulnerable to it.\n\n1275\n01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:37,840\nEven people that you would\nexpect to know better, and\n\n1276\n01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:43,630\ninvest a lot of money in this and\ndoing things right and have regulations.\n\n1277\n01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:45,482\nThey still screw it up.\n\n1278\n01:05:45,482 --> 01:05:51,990\nThere was, I remember a case not\ntoo long ago, you can look it up.\n\n1279\n01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:55,440\nI can't remember the guy's name or\nanything off the top of my head at this\n\n1280\n01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,150\npoint but it happened in Australia where\nthis one guy was a security researcher.\n\n1281\n01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:02,490\nHe's a white hat, people like us.\n\n1282\n01:06:03,750 --> 01:06:09,320\nHe went to his bank's online website,\n\n1283\n01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,780\nlogged in and, did his normal banking but\nhe happened, he noticed that\n\n1284\n01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:17,340\nwhen he's doing his stuff that\nthe URL had a number at the end of it.\n\n1285\n01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,990\nWhich is a session ID in this case,\nbut he looked at it, and\n\n1286\n01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:22,810\nsays that number looks really familiar.\n\n1287\n01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:26,841\nAnd when he looked at it,\nit's actually his account number.\n\n1288\n01:06:26,841 --> 01:06:27,350\n>> What?\n\n1289\n01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:28,554\n>> They hadn't scrambled it at all.\n\n1290\n01:06:28,554 --> 01:06:30,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's sitting right up there okay.\n\n1291\n01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:31,140\n>> Holy crap.\n\n1292\n01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,660\n>> So\nyou can file that as problem number one.\n\n1293\n01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:34,570\n>> Right.\n\n1294\n01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:37,990\n>> Yeah so he decided to,\nwhen he was doing this,\n\n1295\n01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:40,992\nuse of this case that can't be,\nand they said well, okay it is.\n\n1296\n01:06:40,992 --> 01:06:45,470\nHe goes, he kind of had something\nin his mind and he said, I wonder.\n\n1297\n01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:49,270\nAnd he changed the last couple digits\nof it to see what would happen.\n\n1298\n01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:52,110\nChanged the last couple digits he\njumped over into someone else's\n\n1299\n01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:55,330\naccount in that bank without\nauthentication, right in.\n\n1300\n01:06:55,330 --> 01:06:55,870\n>> Wow.\n\n1301\n01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:56,990\n>> So, basically what they had is,\n\n1302\n01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:01,100\nthey had something where you could\nauthenticate to get in to the system, but\n\n1303\n01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:04,050\nonce you're over that wall,\neverything was open to you.\n\n1304\n01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:05,940\n>> So you just had to change\nthe account number and\n\n1305\n01:07:05,940 --> 01:07:07,620\nyou can swap from one\naccount to the other.\n\n1306\n01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,160\n>> Yeah.\n\n1307\n01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:09,990\n>> Without an additional layer\nof authentication there.\n\n1308\n01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:12,010\n>> Yeah, he found out how\nyou could click buttons and\n\n1309\n01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,100\ndo stuff in the other accounts, too.\n\n1310\n01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,990\n>> I mean he didn't go as far as to and\nwe have to believe him,\n\n1311\n01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:21,600\ndidn't go as far as to transfer\nany money or anything like that.\n\n1312\n01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:22,720\n>> He is a white hat after all.\n\n1313\n01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,480\n>> Yeah.\n\n1314\n01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,720\nHe found that he was able to hop\ninto several accounts that way.\n\n1315\n01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,630\nIt wasn't just a one up thing.\n\n1316\n01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:32,960\nSo he called that bank and\ntold them this is a problem\n\n1317\n01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,403\nyou need to fix it and it-\n>> They crapped their pants.\n\n1318\n01:07:37,403 --> 01:07:40,550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so\n\n1319\n01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:45,300\ndid he because what their response to it\nwas, is they filed a law suit against him.\n\n1320\n01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:46,070\n>> What?\n\n1321\n01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:49,320\n>> Yeah, they filed a lawsuit against him\nbecause he did it without permission.\n\n1322\n01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:50,130\n>> Wow.\n\n1323\n01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:55,247\n>> Which I can, I know what a lot\nof you might be saying about this.\n\n1324\n01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,455\nI would, I don't disagree with it.\n\n1325\n01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:00,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1326\n01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:04,500\n>> You look at, the best is he had good\nintentions with it and reported it.\n\n1327\n01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,500\nOn the other hand, he didn't have\npermission to do it in the first place.\n\n1328\n01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,570\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n1329\n01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:09,510\nYou may have to,\n\n1330\n01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:14,187\nyou may at some point have to face\nsomething like that in your career.\n\n1331\n01:08:14,187 --> 01:08:17,970\nYou're just going to have to\nfigure out what the best thing is.\n\n1332\n01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,900\nTypically, I'm going to err\non the side of caution and\n\n1333\n01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:23,230\nsay that I'm not doing\nit without permission.\n\n1334\n01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> And I'll find some way to report it.\n\n1335\n01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:26,900\nIn that case,\nI would have found some way to report it.\n\n1336\n01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,660\n>> Um-hm.\n>> And say yeah, I see a problem here.\n\n1337\n01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:31,820\nMy account number is visible up here.\n\n1338\n01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,715\nAnd then maybe give them a nudge that way.\n\n1339\n01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:37,025\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Even though I knew what the truth was.\n\n1340\n01:08:37,025 --> 01:08:38,200\n>> Yeah.\n\n1341\n01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,980\n>> And then said if they need any help,\nidentify myself and all that.\n\n1342\n01:08:41,980 --> 01:08:47,470\nBut yeah, it's something that\ncan definitely be a problem.\n\n1343\n01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,600\n>> Right.\n>> For you.\n\n1344\n01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:50,262\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1345\n01:08:50,262 --> 01:08:53,120\nThere's, I've gotten into some stuff and\nyou just, you look at it and\n\n1346\n01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,610\nyou go huh, wow.\n\n1347\n01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:55,670\nI can't believe I can do that.\n\n1348\n01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,955\nYou close it and you forget about it.\n\n1349\n01:08:56,955 --> 01:09:00,299\nThat is just,\nit's not because of things like that.\n\n1350\n01:09:00,299 --> 01:09:05,340\nThat bank is gonna file a lawsuit against\nhim, not because he did anything.\n\n1351\n01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:08,600\nI mean, he did something without\npermission, but he didn't cause any harm,\n\n1352\n01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,780\nany damage, didn't steal money,\nwhich he could have, most likely.\n\n1353\n01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:12,900\nBut they've gotta save face.\n\n1354\n01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:15,190\nThey're embarrassed and things like that.\n\n1355\n01:09:15,190 --> 01:09:18,040\nSo, like you say,\npoint it out in a different way.\n\n1356\n01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,602\nDon't say,\nI got into your other customer's account.\n\n1357\n01:09:21,602 --> 01:09:23,830\nSay, is that my account\nnumber there in the thing?\n\n1358\n01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:29,810\nNo, that's a good idea, good suggestion\n>> Yeah, it's a tough situation you might\n\n1359\n01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:35,310\nvery well find yourself into, but really\ncarefully evaluate what you're doing.\n\n1360\n01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:35,870\nYeah, it's,\n\n1361\n01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:39,310\nand there's been numerous people that have\nsaid that over the course of hacking.\n\n1362\n01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:41,090\nYou wouldn't.\nThis guy isn't the first,\n\n1363\n01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:45,681\nhe won't be the last that\nhe found a problem and\n\n1364\n01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:50,520\nreported it, and\nis the one that got in trouble for it.\n\n1365\n01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,820\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean look up what's the other guy's\n\n1366\n01:09:52,820 --> 01:09:54,860\nname, what, Adrian Lamo?\n\n1367\n01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:55,630\n>> Was he the one?\n\n1368\n01:09:55,630 --> 01:09:59,210\n>> Yeah, he was another, he was the one\nwho busted into several places and\n\n1369\n01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:02,380\nhe helped several of those companies.\n\n1370\n01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,430\nAfter he found it, he told them,\ndidn't tell anyone else, and\n\n1371\n01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:09,300\nwent to the company themselves and\nhelped them fix the problem.\n\n1372\n01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:11,660\nIt only took one company.\n\n1373\n01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:16,470\nI think it was the New York Times\nthat he broke into and\n\n1374\n01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,900\nthey didn't like it\n>> Hm.\n\n1375\n01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:18,910\n>> And that's all it took.\n\n1376\n01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:19,910\n>> Right.\n\n1377\n01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:23,550\n>> So even though he had a record of\ndoing, of helping other places and\n\n1378\n01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,837\nthose companies attested that he did it.\n\n1379\n01:10:25,837 --> 01:10:29,193\nIt only took one to say we\ndidn't want him in there and\n\n1380\n01:10:29,193 --> 01:10:31,191\nhe got in trouble with the law.\n\n1381\n01:10:31,191 --> 01:10:31,737\n>> RIght.\n\n1382\n01:10:31,737 --> 01:10:37,850\n>> So it can be a very, very touchy thing.\n\n1383\n01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,207\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As I remember a boss of mine years ago\n\n1384\n01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:43,960\nsaying, the road to hell's\npaved with good intentions.\n\n1385\n01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:45,360\n>> Yes.\nMm-hm.\n\n1386\n01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,400\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\n1387\n01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:49,340\nYou think you're doing the right thing,\nyou're helping them out.\n\n1388\n01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:50,425\nThey're not gonna see it that way.\n\n1389\n01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:54,260\nThe whole, I'm gonna get a job because\nI'm gonna show you the vulnerabilities\n\n1390\n01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,610\nthat you found are few and far between.\n\n1391\n01:10:56,610 --> 01:10:57,740\nVery, very few.\n\n1392\n01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,682\n>> Yeah\n>> Very, very far between.\n\n1393\n01:10:58,682 --> 01:11:01,120\n>> Look at the opinions in there.\n\n1394\n01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,610\n>> I find them fascinating.\n\n1395\n01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:07,290\nMichaela, you've gotta a, I'm not\ngonna disagree with you on that one,\n\n1396\n01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:08,170\nsaying it's,\n\n1397\n01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:12,925\nyou don't think it counts an unauthorized\naction to do something like that.\n\n1398\n01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:14,312\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1399\n01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:18,160\n>> Yeah but I understand where\nyou're going with that, but\n\n1400\n01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:21,810\nhe did go into a part of the system\nthat he wasn't authorized to go into.\n\n1401\n01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,510\n>> Right.\n\n1402\n01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:26,633\nAnd had he typed in a couple numbers,\nrealized he was in a different account,\n\n1403\n01:11:26,633 --> 01:11:30,069\nclosed his browser, moved his\nmoney from one bank to the other?\n\n1404\n01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:31,798\nHe wouldn't have gotten in any trouble so.\n\n1405\n01:11:31,798 --> 01:11:36,696\n>> Yeah it's, I can't remember what\nthe final outcome of the case was, but\n\n1406\n01:11:36,696 --> 01:11:39,480\nit's, you can look that up on your own.\n\n1407\n01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:42,710\nWe're not going to do a news report,\na news cast here.\n\n1408\n01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,800\nI just thought it was something that\nwas worthwhile pointing out cuz\n\n1409\n01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,020\nit's in the same topic area that\nwe're talking about and also it\n\n1410\n01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:51,010\ntalks to some of the other things that-\n>> Right.\n\n1411\n01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:53,350\n>> That we've had,\ngetting permission and stuff like that.\n\n1412\n01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:54,120\n>> Yep.\n\n1413\n01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:54,690\nGotta

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,820\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,870\nI'm your host Most Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,285\nHow you doing today, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:43,370\n>> Doing great.\n\n9\n00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,230\n>> Fantastic.\n\n10\n00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,200\nGlad to have Sean here.\n\n11\n00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,360\nWe are continuing on\nwith our CEH episodes.\n\n12\n00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,500\nAnd with this episode we're\ngonna go into chapter 13,\n\n13\n00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,890\nwhich is web servers and web applications.\n\n14\n00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,110\nIt's a lot of good information here.\n\n15\n00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:01,190\nWeb servers Sean, I think a big\ntarget when it comes to hacking.\n\n16\n00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,380\nSo something we definitely\nwanna pay attention to.\n\n17\n00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,890\nBoth the methods that we\nuse as a pen tester, or\n\n18\n00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,770\nas a certified ethical hacker, to test\nweb servers to find vulnerabilities.\n\n19\n00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,122\nAs well as maybe how to defend\nagainst some of those vulnerabilities.\n\n20\n00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:16,260\n>> Yeah definitely.\n\n21\n00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,160\nWhen you talk about,\nwe got two things we're covering here,\n\n22\n00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,925\nwe're talking about web servers and\nthe web applications.\n\n23\n00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:25,290\nThey both work together.\n\n24\n00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,530\n>> Or one can work on it's own.\n\n25\n00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,335\nBut one requires the other to run.\n\n26\n00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:35,610\nBut, when we talk about the two,\nweb servers are the first piece of that.\n\n27\n00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,430\nWeb servers are definitely a huge,\n\n28\n00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,460\nhuge target for a company or\nfor an attacker to go after.\n\n29\n00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,740\nThey're definitely the public\nface of the organization.\n\n30\n00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,440\nThey can host a lot of content.\n\n31\n00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,860\nAnd frequently there's problems with\nthem that will allow you to get in.\n\n32\n00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:58,980\n>> Yeah, we know some of those flavors of\nour web servers, Microsoft IIS, definitely\n\n33\n00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:03,080\nhas it's share of vulnerabilities\nthat make it a nice target.\n\n34\n00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,030\nAnd as we've said in other episodes,\n\n35\n00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,988\nthat web server is that thing that sits\nout in front, typically out on our DMZ,\n\n36\n00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:13,350\nit needs to be exposed if we're running a\npublic website, it needs to be accessible\n\n37\n00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:17,330\nfrom the internet and\na lot of times to anonymous people.\n\n38\n00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,500\nSo because of that level of exposure,\n\n39\n00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,570\nit just opens us up to all\nkinds of vectors of attack.\n\n40\n00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,420\nAnd we really gotta make sure we know what\nwe're doing to keep those guys secure.\n\n41\n00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,240\n>> I guess first let's talk about\nthe anatomy of a web server, as you say.\n\n42\n00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,968\nWhat is it that makes up a web server, and\nI don't even know what a web server is.\n\n43\n00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:36,844\n[LAUGH]\n>> You're kidding.\n\n44\n00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:40,090\n[LAUGH] You guys know what it is, right?\n\n45\n00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,720\n>> Hopefully at this point they do.\n\n46\n00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,870\nRight?\n[LAUGH]\n\n47\n00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,630\n>> It's Spiderman's second job\n\n48\n00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,730\nat a restaurant.\n\n49\n00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:46,650\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n50\n00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,720\n>> Yeah, see.\n\n51\n00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,835\n>> Easy web server.\n\n52\n00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,981\n>> [SOUND] All right, so.\n\n53\n00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:52,504\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n54\n00:02:52,504 --> 00:02:57,729\nBut what we have when we talk\nabout a web server, we really have\n\n55\n00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:04,760\na whole bunch of different web servers\nout there on the market that you can use.\n\n56\n00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,410\nAnd some of them are actually pretty old.\n\n57\n00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,630\nThey're still, if you can believe it,\nthey're still Netscape servers out there.\n\n58\n00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,475\nAnd they identify themselves\nas Netscape servers.\n\n59\n00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n60\n00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,590\nthat tells you kind of\nhow old these things are.\n\n61\n00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,620\nSo, yeah, you can get the little\nmini music and stuff like that,\n\n62\n00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,125\nI'm pretty sure, on those same servers.\n\n63\n00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:28,515\nBut these are some old,\nold stuff, but the main ones\n\n64\n00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:33,245\nyou're gonna run into nowadays are\ndefinitely going to be IAS and Apache and\n\n65\n00:03:33,245 --> 00:03:37,875\nanother one called Engine X\nis out there to a degree.\n\n66\n00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,190\nIt's out there in the field.\n\n67\n00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,690\nBut mostly it's gonna be Apache,\nthen IS, then probably Nginx, or\n\n68\n00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,490\nmaybe Nginx and\nIS filling out the second and third spots.\n\n69\n00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:55,210\nNow they do share some things in common,\nbut they also have a lot of differences.\n\n70\n00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,810\nYou know Apache is something that runs\nprimarily on the UNIX and Linux side.\n\n71\n00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:03,590\nIt has been around for quite a while.\n\n72\n00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,115\nIt's been put through it's paces and\nbeen beaten on and all that.\n\n73\n00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,045\nIt's very modular design, so\n\n74\n00:04:12,045 --> 00:04:17,015\nyou can load and\nunload various things into it.\n\n75\n00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:19,675\nHas a lot of open source\nstuff you can add in, so\n\n76\n00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:25,460\nyou can really customize it to\na very high degree over IS.\n\n77\n00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,130\nOn the other hand, and I guess I should\nalso by the way put a footnote in there,\n\n78\n00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,760\neither the Apache does, or\nis actually available for Windows,\n\n79\n00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,455\nbut I just can't see anybody\nrunning it for Windows.\n\n80\n00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not that it doesn't happen.\n\n81\n00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,230\n>> Right.\n\n82\n00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,280\n>> But it's not something that we even\nreally worry about too much in here.\n\n83\n00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,230\nWe're pretty much assuming,\nif you're talking Unix or\n\n84\n00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,190\nLinux, it's gonna be running,\nor you're talking Apache,\n\n85\n00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,770\nit's gonna be running on Unix and\nLinux platforms almost 100% of the time.\n\n86\n00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:01,040\nThen we roll over to the Windows side,\nand of course we have IIS.\n\n87\n00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,550\nIIS has gone through\na heck of an evolution.\n\n88\n00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,410\n>> [LAUGH] Yes.\n\n89\n00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,390\n>> And you go from the old days to now,\n\n90\n00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,610\nit is undergoing a dramatic evolution.\n\n91\n00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,270\nIn fact if you go from IES 5,\nwhich was Windows 2000,\n\n92\n00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,870\nwhich there's still quite a bit\nof those out there, to 2003,\n\n93\n00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,670\nto 2008 and 2012, you'll notice that\nMicrosoft has shifted to go from\n\n94\n00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,290\nmore of a monolithic design where\neverything is mushed into one bucket.\n\n95\n00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,900\nAnd everything's enabled by default.\n\n96\n00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,850\nWhat they've done,\nis they've gone through and\n\n97\n00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,030\nmade it over the past few releases where\nit has as well become more modular.\n\n98\n00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,490\nYou can load in the stuff that you need,\nand\n\n99\n00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:47,280\nthen it's also switched where it's gone\nfrom having everything enabled by default,\n\n100\n00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,420\nto having just about everything\ndisabled by default, and\n\n101\n00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,810\nyou just load the modules and\nenable the stuff that you need.\n\n102\n00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,730\nSo that makes it much more secure.\n\n103\n00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:02,530\nBut is very much a modular design now,\nmuch more than it was in the past.\n\n104\n00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,490\nDoesn't mean it doesn't have flaws.\n\n105\n00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,200\nDoesn't mean there aren't issues\nhiding underneath there to get you.\n\n106\n00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,500\nIt also doesn't mean that we don't have\nsome of that legacy code in there.\n\n107\n00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,790\nYou know how Microsoft\nis with legacy stuff.\n\n108\n00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,000\n>> Backwards compatibility.\n\n109\n00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,370\nTrying to make sure, and sometimes that\nbrings in vulnerabilities when we've gotta\n\n110\n00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,330\nmaintain that compatibility with older\noperating systems, older applications.\n\n111\n00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,070\nThat means I can't get rid of some of that\ncode even though some of that code might\n\n112\n00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,480\nhave some vulnerabilities in it.\n\n113\n00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,170\nWe just try to patch it up, you know?\n\n114\n00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:33,650\nAnd they've definitely\nshifted to a much more, and\n\n115\n00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,230\nI think they got the, well I don't\nthink they got the idea from Linux or\n\n116\n00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,210\nanything like that, but that's just\na security best practice right?\n\n117\n00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,210\nWe teach that in all our security classes,\nis you only install or\n\n118\n00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,360\nconfigure what it is you need and\nyou leave everything else out, right?\n\n119\n00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,460\nIf you're not using it, turn it off.\n\n120\n00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,040\nAnd as you say, well back in\nthe day when you installed IIS,\n\n121\n00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,340\nyou also got a network news server,\na FTP server, and who knows what else.\n\n122\n00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,170\nNow if you install IIS on 2012R2,\nyou don't even get Windows authentication.\n\n123\n00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,330\nI mean you've got to go in there and\n\n124\n00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,118\nchoose which authentication\nmethod you want.\n\n125\n00:07:04,118 --> 00:07:07,210\nSo they've changed that up\nto be much more modular,\n\n126\n00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,790\nwhich means I'm not running things\nthat I didn't plan on running,\n\n127\n00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,980\nwhich means I'm going to\nmake a more secure system.\n\n128\n00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,760\n>> Yeah.\n\n129\n00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,010\nIt definitely has changed quite a bit.\n\n130\n00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:21,210\nI don't know about you, I know you\ndo the Microsoft classes as well,\n\n131\n00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,580\nbut I know when 2003 and\nthen 2008 came out, you had\n\n132\n00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,630\npeople complaining that moved from 2000\nsaying, this is too difficult to set up.\n\n133\n00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,570\nMicrosoft broke all this,\nit's like no it's still there,\n\n134\n00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,960\nyou just have to read\nthe instructions now.\n\n135\n00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,500\nYou know, the instructions right?\n\n136\n00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,450\nIt's the stuff you never read?\n\n137\n00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:39,510\n>> What?\nYou mean I actually had to\n\n138\n00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,640\nknow what I'm doing to setup a web server?\n\n139\n00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,250\nThat's crazy talk.\n\n140\n00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,710\n>> Yeah it was amazing.\n\n141\n00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,437\nYou could almost pick\nout the PA to it too.\n\n142\n00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:49,624\nTo a T you could pick out the person or\nthe people that said that,\n\n143\n00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:53,896\nand say yeah, they're the ones that got to\nwork on that or were Were targets before,\n\n144\n00:07:53,896 --> 00:07:57,730\nbecause they were just used to hey,\nI plug it in and it works.\n\n145\n00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,380\nSo, that's\n\n146\n00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,790\nsomething you do have to think about as a\npen tester if you run into that attitude.\n\n147\n00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,100\nIt's something that could go to\nyour benefit as a pen tester,\n\n148\n00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,590\nmake you successful.\n\n149\n00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:15,110\nBut it's gonna make them kinda be a pain.\n\n150\n00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,630\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n151\n00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,190\n>> When you start breaking in.\n\n152\n00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,450\n>> Right.\nAll right, So we've got our web servers.\n\n153\n00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:24,040\nWhen we talk about a web server and\nit should be assumed knowledge guys and\n\n154\n00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,730\ngals out there.\n\n155\n00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,930\nBut it's a client server model, right?\n\n156\n00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,090\nWe've got a server providing a resource or\na service.\n\n157\n00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,200\nAnd then as a client we're connecting\nto that and consuming that resource or\n\n158\n00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,090\nthat service.\n\n159\n00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,800\nSo web server is the one that's\nproviding those web pages, for example.\n\n160\n00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,520\nWe connect to it.\n\n161\n00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,890\nWe establish a connection.\n\n162\n00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,850\nWe connect to port 80 or\nwhatever port we're using and\n\n163\n00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,950\nthen it's gonna be able to deliver or\nserve up those web pages.\n\n164\n00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,540\nAnd then we've got our web applications\nthat can then run on top of that\n\n165\n00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,240\nweb server.\n\n166\n00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,220\n>> Yeah,\nweb applications introduce a whole other\n\n167\n00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,720\nlayer on top of what we\nalready have as a web server.\n\n168\n00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,710\nIf you look at this as kind of like\nas a stack what we have is we have\n\n169\n00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,510\nthe operating system, then we have\nthe web server which is more or less,\n\n170\n00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,690\nit can be kind of confusing cuz the web\nserver doesn't agree with the operating\n\n171\n00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,230\nsystem but there are some things\nthat run kind of on top of it too so\n\n172\n00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,490\nit's kinda sorta an application but\nit's kinda sorta a service too.\n\n173\n00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,740\nThen we have the web application\nthat runs on top of that and\n\n174\n00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,200\na web application can\nencompass a lot of things.\n\n175\n00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,375\nIn fact, a web application is a really,\nit's almost a nebulous term,\n\n176\n00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:35,065\nit covers just so much ground,\nit's like, it's a web application.\n\n177\n00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:37,085\nIt's like what the heck does that mean.\n\n178\n00:09:37,085 --> 00:09:39,305\nIt's like saying you have\nan app on your phone.\n\n179\n00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:42,055\nWhen they were using that\nbuzzword there's an app for that,\n\n180\n00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:43,840\neverything seemed to be an app.\n\n181\n00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,620\nIt's kind of like web applications.\n\n182\n00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,250\nEverything seems to be a web application.\n\n183\n00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,567\nThere's no clear,\n\n184\n00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:53,890\nreally 100% clear definition of\nit when you initially look at it.\n\n185\n00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,860\nYou can break it down for some things.\n\n186\n00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:01,450\nWeb applications tend to do their\nprocessing on the server side.\n\n187\n00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,470\nThey tend to use more\nthan just static pages.\n\n188\n00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:09,450\nIn fact, if you have a static page\nin HTML, it really doesn't fit in.\n\n189\n00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,830\nIt doesn't fit in as\na web application at all.\n\n190\n00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:17,350\nIt has to be something that's dynamically\nprocessed by some sort of engine\n\n191\n00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,760\nthat's installed on the web server itself.\n\n192\n00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:27,070\nSomething like PHP, ASP.net, what's it,\nCold Fusion would fall into that category.\n\n193\n00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,560\nThen we have stuff like\nSharePoint's a web application.\n\n194\n00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,330\nIPTV is a web application.\n\n195\n00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,880\nIt's a pretty busy category.\n\n196\n00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,380\n>> [LAUGH] It really is a crazy term.\n\n197\n00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,636\nI mean it's like if I have a picture,\nand I post it on the web page,\n\n198\n00:10:42,636 --> 00:10:44,330\nis that now a web picture?\n\n199\n00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,864\nBut if I take an application and then make\nit available through a web interface,\n\n200\n00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:49,250\nit is now a web application is.\n\n201\n00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:53,570\n>> Yeah it can be pretty\nconfusing when you get down to it.\n\n202\n00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,368\nIn fact,\nnow they're talking about this whole web\n\n203\n00:10:57,368 --> 00:11:01,770\n2.0 portfolio of applications and\nthat gets even more confusing.\n\n204\n00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,280\nIt's even funnier when they say Web 2.0.\n\n205\n00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,570\nAnd you look at some of the stuff\nthat's considered Web 2.0,\n\n206\n00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,650\nyou kind of scratch your head and\nit's like really?\n\n207\n00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,290\nThat's something that belongs there\nas a nice modern application?\n\n208\n00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:19,720\nFor example, blogs are considered\nWeb 2.0 web applications.\n\n209\n00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,345\nA blog.\n\n210\n00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:23,635\n>> [LAUGH] That's been\naround since before HTML.\n\n211\n00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:24,520\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, but\n\n212\n00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,520\nthen you have stuff like Twitter and\nFacebook.\n\n213\n00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,085\nBasically, all your social media stuff\nis going to be there, as well as\n\n214\n00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:37,415\nyour apps on your phone that connect\nto web applications, streaming video.\n\n215\n00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:40,045\nWe could go on and on and on about it.\n\n216\n00:11:40,045 --> 00:11:41,715\nWe won't, but we could.\n\n217\n00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:44,005\nThere's just so many.\n\n218\n00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:48,774\nWeb applications, also another\nreasonably common characteristic is\n\n219\n00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,490\nthat they attach to something.\n\n220\n00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:55,320\nRunning on an operating system,\neither locally or someplace else.\n\n221\n00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,317\nTypically that items is a database.\n\n222\n00:11:57,317 --> 00:12:03,050\nSo, that's why we won't be\ntalking about fully today, but\n\n223\n00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,800\nwhen we go in later on,\nwe'll be talking about SQL injections.\n\n224\n00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,670\nAnd you'll find that vulnerabilities\n\n225\n00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:15,560\nat the web application level can lead you\ndirectly into SQL injections, just like\n\n226\n00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,930\nstuff that's on the web server can lead\nyou directly into web application stuff.\n\n227\n00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,010\nThese things are kind of all mushed\ntogether when you get down to it.\n\n228\n00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,740\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n229\n00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,760\nSo really, the way I really like to think\nof a web app is It's really a web page or\n\n230\n00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,280\nsomething being provided that\nI'm visiting using HTML but\n\n231\n00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,510\nit's more than just a webpage.\n\n232\n00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,620\nIt's not just delivering static content,\nor\n\n233\n00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,660\neven when I say static versus dynamics, I\ndon't mean static as like it's not moving.\n\n234\n00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,480\nA video obviously has\na little motion to it but\n\n235\n00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,420\nits not really dynamic\ncontent whereas a web app.\n\n236\n00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:54,220\nSomething I interact with like there might\nbe an order form or something like that,\n\n237\n00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,140\nwhere I'm interacting with it and\nthere's a good chance that that server\n\n238\n00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:01,230\nis then making connections with other\nservers that are providing some data.\n\n239\n00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,510\nLike if I order something, it's gonna\nreach out and put an order into a SQL\n\n240\n00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,110\ndatabase or something like that, in a\ncatalog it's pulling up information out of\n\n241\n00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:13,080\na database and displaying it to me and\nI get descriptions and things like that.\n\n242\n00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,696\nSo maybe a little more interactive\nthen say a normal web page but\n\n243\n00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,580\ndifficult to really define, I think.\n\n244\n00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,250\nThe simple definition applications\nthat are being delivered via HTML.\n\n245\n00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,130\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n246\n00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,991\nIt's stuff that fits in\nit's one of our viewer\n\n247\n00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:37,993\nhere says loosely, to use that term.\n\n248\n00:13:37,993 --> 00:13:41,380\nVery loose definition of these sayings.\n\n249\n00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,000\nThat can be somewhat confusing.\n\n250\n00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,851\nThat's one of the reasons why when you\nlook at something just to kind of bring\n\n251\n00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:51,670\nthat back to where the CEH comes in.\n\n252\n00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,380\nThe CEH when you look at it,\nwhat is a web application?\n\n253\n00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,090\nWe just said it's a very,\nvery broad definition.\n\n254\n00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,880\nIt's such a densely populated\nspace in the market.\n\n255\n00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,180\nSo we really can't,\nin the context of this course, say,\n\n256\n00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,170\nhey here's how you look at\na specific web application.\n\n257\n00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:21,040\nBecause that's a very\nspecific implementation,\n\n258\n00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,870\nlayout and therefore we have to be,\nwe can't really zero in on one.\n\n259\n00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,140\nWe're not going to make this a,\nI keep saying SharePoint.\n\n260\n00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,920\n>> Right.\n>> But SharePoint's a web application.\n\n261\n00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,554\nCan't make this a SharePoint class and\nsay, hey, I noticed how you audit code and\n\n262\n00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:37,230\nall that.\n\n263\n00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,880\nWe have to talk about this in pretty\nbroad strokes, things that you could use.\n\n264\n00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:46,260\nAnd then have to customize further when\nyou're evaluating a given web application.\n\n265\n00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,600\n>> And we really just want to make\nsure we keep them separate, right?\n\n266\n00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,770\nWe've got the web server and\nthen we've got the web application that's\n\n267\n00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,350\nrunning on that server, so different\navenues of attack for those, right?\n\n268\n00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,140\nAnd you can have a very secure web\nserver but that web application might\n\n269\n00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,990\nbring a vulnerability to light or\nadd a new vector of attack, for example.\n\n270\n00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,340\nOr I could have my applications relatively\nsecure, but if the underlying web server\n\n271\n00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,200\nhas vulnerabilities that could\nput it all at risk as well.\n\n272\n00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,590\nSo really two separate things\nthat we're dealing with there.\n\n273\n00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,190\nThe server itself and\n\n274\n00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,200\nthen the applications that\nare running on that server.\n\n275\n00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,290\n>> Yes,\nthere are two separate entities, but\n\n276\n00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,060\nthey are very closely woven together\nin how they talk to one another.\n\n277\n00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:35,710\nAnd in fact, this is actually\na great point to talk about.\n\n278\n00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:40,390\nYou know, that web server web\napplication deal from another angle.\n\n279\n00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:45,746\nWhen you look at it as you can attest to\nfrom doing the Microsoft stuff as well.\n\n280\n00:15:45,746 --> 00:15:50,556\nMicrosoft and a lot of their products, and\nagain they're not the only ones that do\n\n281\n00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:53,429\nthis but\nit's the one that most can relate to..\n\n282\n00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:57,742\nMicrosoft has it, where there's a lot of\ntheir products in their portfolio that you\n\n283\n00:15:57,742 --> 00:16:01,830\ninstall, even just in the Windows Server\nalone, not to mention other things.\n\n284\n00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:07,040\nWhen you install it, it asks you to\ninstall the web server as part of that.\n\n285\n00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,936\nAnd there's an issue with that too, that\nkind of fits into the whole discussion,\n\n286\n00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:13,250\nis when you install any\nsort of web application,\n\n287\n00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,970\nthere's a lot of these applications,\nthey ask for the web server.\n\n288\n00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,330\nLot of times, if an application\nrequires you to install the web server,\n\n289\n00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,890\nyou no longer have to go into\nthe web server to manage it anymore.\n\n290\n00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,350\nYou have to go into that console for\n\n291\n00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,660\nwhatever it is, like Certificate Services\nor something like that.\n\n292\n00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,450\nYou install that, and now Certificate\nServices has something on the web server,\n\n293\n00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,490\nbut you manage it through\nthe Certificate Services console.\n\n294\n00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,950\nThat causes a problem later on,\n\n295\n00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,240\nbecause what if you've\ninstalled any sort of web app?\n\n296\n00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,030\nYou've installed a web app and it says,\nI need the web server installed.\n\n297\n00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,320\nSo you're like okay, you click the box,\nit installs the web server.\n\n298\n00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920\nNow you're working with the new product.\n\n299\n00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,070\nYou're letting it do the web server\nmanagement behind the scenes.\n\n300\n00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,106\nIt's not really worried about security,\nthese applications typically aren't\n\n301\n00:16:58,106 --> 00:16:59,830\nworried about security really,\nin any case.\n\n302\n00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,040\nThey do the basics, and then that's it.\n\n303\n00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,506\nSo, there's more situations with\nweb servers getting installed by\n\n304\n00:17:06,506 --> 00:17:10,664\nan application, but\npeople are using the web application, and\n\n305\n00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:13,980\nnot looking up the web\nserver directly either.\n\n306\n00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,302\nAnd so they could leave vulnerabilities on\none and not the other, and all it takes me\n\n307\n00:17:18,302 --> 00:17:22,160\nis a vulnerability or two to punch\nright in and compromise the whole mess.\n\n308\n00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,002\n>> You see that a lot where somebody's\ninstalling an application and\n\n309\n00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,160\nthen they're just clicking next,\nnext, next through the darn wizard.\n\n310\n00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,116\nAnd they get an IIS server\nin the background, and\n\n311\n00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:33,316\nthey don't bother securing that because\nthey're not even thinking about it,\n\n312\n00:17:33,316 --> 00:17:36,200\nthey're just worried about\nthe application that they're managing.\n\n313\n00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,040\n>> Yeah.\n\n314\n00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,950\nIt's a big, big concern.\n\n315\n00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,840\nIt's something that you should\nthink about when you're doing this.\n\n316\n00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,580\nThink about how many applications\nyou've installed recently, and\n\n317\n00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,102\nwe'll make it,\nwe'll use a pretty loose, just to use.\n\n318\n00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:56,327\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That term again, you know, time frame.\n\n319\n00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:59,470\nThink of the applications and services and\n\n320\n00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,700\nstuff that you've installed over\nthe past two or three years.\n\n321\n00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,110\nHow many of them did require\nthe web server to go,\n\n322\n00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:08,090\nas a part of that whole setup?\n\n323\n00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,320\nAnd do you ever actually look at the web\nserver, or do you just go through\n\n324\n00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,330\nthe management console for that product\nto do what's specific to that product?\n\n325\n00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,960\nSo you really need to now more,\nI would say now more than ever,\n\n326\n00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,430\nyou really need to be familiar with\nhow a web server can be compromised,\n\n327\n00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:30,330\nhow people do their\nresearch on it to get in.\n\n328\n00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:35,460\nFortunately as we're gonna see, when\nyou get into web servers there's a lot\n\n329\n00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,210\nof ways to compromise a web server,\nand except for a couple unique\n\n330\n00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,710\nthings that we're gonna discuss, it's\na lot of stuff that you've already seen.\n\n331\n00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,224\nIt's a whole lot of it, we're just\ngonna take those things and say,\n\n332\n00:18:49,224 --> 00:18:53,162\ntake them out of wherever we used them\nbefore, take those building blocks and\n\n333\n00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:57,618\nsnap them into our attack sequence in\nhere, and then we're off and rolling.\n\n334\n00:18:57,618 --> 00:19:01,740\nSo, that's kind of a cool thing,\nwe're just introducing a few new things,\n\n335\n00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,950\nbut bringing a lot of old\nones to help us evaluate and\n\n336\n00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,950\nvisualize the attack\nservice of a web server.\n\n337\n00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,952\n>> Right, right.\n\n338\n00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:14,000\nAll right, so speaking of all\nthese different avenues of attack,\n\n339\n00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,540\nlet's start talking about some of them.\n\n340\n00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,580\nStarting with the web server itself,\nif I'm going to attack a web server,\n\n341\n00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,329\nwe use a very similar methodology, kind\nof to start with as we do with the actual\n\n342\n00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,250\nhacking phase, right, or\nthe hacking life cycle.\n\n343\n00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,530\n>> Yeah,\nthe first series of shows we did for\n\n344\n00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,620\nthe overall CEH course,\nwe talked about the hacking process.\n\n345\n00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,480\nA lot of those things are coming back and\nstaring us right in the face now.\n\n346\n00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,780\nSo all that research that we did, those\nthings that we did across those phases,\n\n347\n00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,610\nwe can either reuse\nthe information that we have,\n\n348\n00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,890\nor we could tweak those process\njust a bit to get additional things\n\n349\n00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,730\nabout a web server or web application.\n\n350\n00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,580\nSo all those things fit in.\n\n351\n00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,980\nWe have to figure out\nwhat we're looking at.\n\n352\n00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,630\nWe need to figure out where the\nvulnerabilities are, how we can exploit\n\n353\n00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,660\nthose vulnerabilities, and then position\nadditional attacks once we start\n\n354\n00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,550\nreally figuring out where it is we stand\nin relation to the holes on a web server.\n\n355\n00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,490\nAnd this could be, by the way,\nwith any web server.\n\n356\n00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,705\nIt's not specific to any type of web\nserver, you're still gonna do the research\n\n357\n00:20:25,705 --> 00:20:29,190\nand figure out what's going on, know\nthe plot, have your plot for knowledge in\n\n358\n00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,768\nplace and figure how you're going to\npunch in and start messing with things.\n\n359\n00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:36,905\n>> Right, so then,\nreally our first step then about,\n\n360\n00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:40,915\nif we're going to attack a web server,\nthen is to figure out what the heck it is.\n\n361\n00:20:40,915 --> 00:20:44,215\nWhat is that web server running,\ncuz that's gonna change\n\n362\n00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:47,592\nthe vulnerabilities that I might\nhave available to attack, and\n\n363\n00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:49,692\nthe methods that I'd use for\nattacking that server.\n\n364\n00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:55,280\n>> Yeah, that's the thing, is that we have\nplenty of tools, and we just need to,\n\n365\n00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,940\nyeah, figure out what we're looking at,\nwhat the nature of that web server is.\n\n366\n00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,795\nAnd there's actually some really\nfascinating tools out there that we're\n\n367\n00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:08,120\ngonna examine a few of them and\ndiscuss some others.\n\n368\n00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,553\nThat will allow us to start determining\nwhat type of web server we're\n\n369\n00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:12,330\ndealing with.\n\n370\n00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,542\nIs it something that is Microsoft,\n\n371\n00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:21,118\nis it a Microsoft product,\nis it a Unix product, is it Linux?\n\n372\n00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:23,144\nWhat exists actually out there, so\n\n373\n00:21:23,144 --> 00:21:26,125\nwe can get a better idea\nwhat it is we're targeting?\n\n374\n00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:31,584\nIt helps us sharpen our knives\nthe right way for our later attacks.\n\n375\n00:21:31,584 --> 00:21:34,389\n>> All right, I'll tell you what,\nthat's probably a good place for\n\n376\n00:21:34,389 --> 00:21:35,200\nus to take a break.\n\n377\n00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,331\nWe'll round that up,\nwe learned about what a web server is,\n\n378\n00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,200\nwhat a web application is.\n\n379\n00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,764\nAnd when we come back we're gonna\ntalk about attack methods, so\n\n380\n00:21:44,764 --> 00:21:47,410\nwe'll start looking at\nthat web server first.\n\n381\n00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,530\nSo you guys stay tuned.\n\n382\n00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,790\nWe'll be right back.\n\n383\n00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,500\n[SOUND]\n\n384\n00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,990\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\n\n385\n00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,970\ngentlemen, continuing on with our\nweb servers and web applications.\n\n386\n00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:06,820\nGetting ready to talk about some of the\ndifferent types of attacks that we might\n\n387\n00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,070\nbe able to launch against a web server and\ntry to compromise that web server.\n\n388\n00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,160\nSo what's first on our list there, John?\n\n389\n00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,460\n>> Well, let's take a look\nat what we have going on.\n\n390\n00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,910\nThere's a sequence of steps.\n\n391\n00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:24,040\nThe first thing that we have going on,\nis when you're gonna recognize\n\n392\n00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:29,170\nthere's actually, I put it under\nthe banner of footprinting, but\n\n393\n00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:33,470\nit's actually broken down into doing\ninformation collecting, and footprinting.\n\n394\n00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:37,520\nBut you can really consider\nthe whole process footprinting.\n\n395\n00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,550\nWhat we have is a web server,\n\n396\n00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,515\nyou're gonna notice,\nwe've done a lot of this already, right?\n\n397\n00:22:43,515 --> 00:22:44,891\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We've gone through and\n\n398\n00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:48,430\nidentified web servers previously\nin our footprinting process.\n\n399\n00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,850\nThat's why we're bringing it back\nin now is that, what do we do?\n\n400\n00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,576\nWe did Netcraft earlier on, don't even\nneed to show you guys how to do that.\n\n401\n00:22:55,576 --> 00:22:59,740\nYou did Netcraft with me when we\ntalked about it in a previous show.\n\n402\n00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,200\nWe can also do things\nlike banner grabbing.\n\n403\n00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,030\nIf you go to some of these websites,\n\n404\n00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,950\nyou'll get utilities for\nhelping you identify web servers.\n\n405\n00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,500\nOne of the ones that we saw in\na previous episode was our ID Serve,\n\n406\n00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,380\nthat you could type in the name of\na website, and it would go through and\n\n407\n00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,810\nreturn what that website was.\n\n408\n00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,860\nSo we have various ways of\nidentifying the technology.\n\n409\n00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,644\nWhat we're looking for specifically is\nidentifying that technology, what web\n\n410\n00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:36,496\nserver you're running, what technologies\nthey might have running on top of it,\n\n411\n00:23:36,496 --> 00:23:40,748\nand be able to kind of ascertain out\nof all these things what we get back.\n\n412\n00:23:40,748 --> 00:23:44,462\nWhat that environment looks like,\nand as you recall,\n\n413\n00:23:44,462 --> 00:23:46,569\nwe were able to get quite a bit.\n\n414\n00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:51,507\nIf you remember, when I ran Shields Up,\nI was able to pull stuff out of\n\n415\n00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:56,300\nthe header tag to see exactly\nwhat that content was running.\n\n416\n00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,120\n>> Right, right.\n\n417\n00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,040\nSo when we start out then, we've gotta\ngather information about our victim,\n\n418\n00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,880\nour intended target of our attacks.\n\n419\n00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,950\nWe need to know,\nwhat operating system is that running?\n\n420\n00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,900\nWhat web application,\nwell not web application, but\n\n421\n00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,430\nwhat platform is it running,\niOS 5, iOS 7, Apache?\n\n422\n00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,140\nAnd then what technologies have\nbeen enabled on that web server?\n\n423\n00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,886\nBecause these are all very, the later\neditions at least, are very modular,\n\n424\n00:24:22,886 --> 00:24:25,660\ndo they have ASP pages enabled?\n\n425\n00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,330\nThings like that cuz\nthat's gonna change what\n\n426\n00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,232\npossibilities I have when it comes\nto attacking that web server.\n\n427\n00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:35,835\nSo determining the OS, the web server\nplatform, and then the applications or\n\n428\n00:24:35,835 --> 00:24:39,200\nthe services that are being\nprovided on that web server.\n\n429\n00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,140\nAnd we'll just call that kind\nof like footprinting, right?\n\n430\n00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,320\n>> Yeah, that's really what it is.\n\n431\n00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,240\nIs that we're just going through\nour footprinting process and\n\n432\n00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,360\nlike I was saying,\nwe did a lot during footprinting.\n\n433\n00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,740\nThere was just a wealth of\ninformation you can get there.\n\n434\n00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,720\nWho knows?\nMaybe some of the information you\n\n435\n00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,650\nneed to do an attack is already present\non your system and in your notes.\n\n436\n00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,600\nLike I said,\n\n437\n00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,430\none of your key skills as a pen tester\nis being able to take good notes.\n\n438\n00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,827\nSo this is where it's gonna come in,\nis refer back to your documentation and\n\n439\n00:25:09,827 --> 00:25:14,450\nwhat you've previously collected to see\nwhat's gonna be of use in this phase.\n\n440\n00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,110\nYou know, getting stuff like at web\napplication type, if you've got it.\n\n441\n00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,690\nGetting stuff like web server version,\nOS version.\n\n442\n00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,670\nGoing through those job postings.\n\n443\n00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,950\nRemember when we talked about\ngoing through job postings.\n\n444\n00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,720\nJob postings will tell you, I mean heck,\nif you find a job for a company that says,\n\n445\n00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,915\nhey, we need a web administrator,\nor something, done.\n\n446\n00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:34,685\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n447\n00:25:34,685 --> 00:25:35,185\n>> Done.\n\n448\n00:25:36,305 --> 00:25:40,026\nYou've scored a three point shot,\nwhich in basketball does this, right?\n\n449\n00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:40,615\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n450\n00:25:40,615 --> 00:25:44,238\n[LAUGH]\n>> Kick a basketball through the things.\n\n451\n00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:47,253\n>> [LAUGH] Goal!\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n452\n00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:49,955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what they call it.\n\n453\n00:25:49,955 --> 00:25:50,501\n>> Yes, exactly.\n>> And\n\n454\n00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:52,703\nif you get three basketballs through\nthe uprights, that's a hat trick.\n\n455\n00:25:52,703 --> 00:25:55,171\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n456\n00:25:55,171 --> 00:25:57,839\nSo, that's just telling you guys.\n\n457\n00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,735\n>> Sports geeks, computer geeks,\ntypically don't line up anyway, right?\n\n458\n00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:03,873\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\n\n459\n00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:06,756\nif we figure out what the heck\nit is they're running so\n\n460\n00:26:06,756 --> 00:26:09,575\nthat we can try to determine\nwhat avenues of attack or\n\n461\n00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:13,480\nwhat vectors attack I might be\nable to take advantage of there.\n\n462\n00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,480\nOnce we have that,\nthen what do we start doing?\n\n463\n00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,776\n>> Once we've done that,\nthen we can go through and\n\n464\n00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,820\nwe can start going to additional\nsteps of the process.\n\n465\n00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,130\nOne of the things that actually deviates,\ncuz remember we went through and\n\n466\n00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,340\nwe talked about doing footprinting\nin our overall hacking process.\n\n467\n00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,630\nThe next thing is, is being able to\nkinda dig through the web server.\n\n468\n00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,660\nAnd a way we can do that, or\ndig through the content specifically.\n\n469\n00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,120\nNow if you recall, what did we do?\n\n470\n00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,350\nWe did Google hacking.\n\n471\n00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,170\nThat was a really good way to kind\nof figure out what was going on.\n\n472\n00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,040\nBut there is another way.\n\n473\n00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,580\nAnd that's mirroring a website.\n\n474\n00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,365\nOr, in other words,\ndownloading a website onto your system.\n\n475\n00:26:53,365 --> 00:26:54,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n476\n00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,414\n>> And the idea is- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Wait,\n\n477\n00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:58,110\ndid you say download the entire\nwebsite onto my system?\n\n478\n00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,670\n>> Yeah.\n\n479\n00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,630\n>> What?\n\n480\n00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,076\n>> I'm gonna download the internet, baby.\n\n481\n00:27:01,076 --> 00:27:05,495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we're doing is,\n\n482\n00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:10,618\nwe can download a website,\na whole website to a system,\n\n483\n00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:13,790\nand then we can browse it offline.\n\n484\n00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:18,975\nAnd the idea behind that is that if we\nuse some of these website downloaders,\n\n485\n00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:23,362\nmuch like Google hacking where it\nwent in and downloaded a site.\n\n486\n00:27:23,362 --> 00:27:26,773\nWell, Google hacking didn't\ndownload a site, but\n\n487\n00:27:26,773 --> 00:27:31,390\nit would go through the site and\nallow us to see what's going on.\n\n488\n00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,405\nIf we use a website downloader,\nit downloads the site to our system,\n\n489\n00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,410\nand we can now browse\nthrough those files and\n\n490\n00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,340\nmaybe pick up stuff that isn't\nvisible in other places.\n\n491\n00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,290\n>> Yeah, some of those pages that\nthey don't think anybody can get\n\n492\n00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,260\nto because they're not linked anywhere,\n\n493\n00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,660\nsomething like that\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n494\n00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,160\nThey'll see content that's not linked in.\n\n495\n00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:58,800\nYou'll see content that is maybe old and\nout of date.\n\n496\n00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,340\nIt depends on how aggressive you get.\n\n497\n00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,470\nSome of these website\ndownloaders are pretty good.\n\n498\n00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,260\nYou can tell them to go to subdomains and\nstuff like that.\n\n499\n00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,590\n>> Right.\n>> And they'll just start\n\n500\n00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,610\npulling all this stuff down.\n\n501\n00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,690\nThe downside of it is,\nis that if you are too aggressive with it,\n\n502\n00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,230\nthey're gonna see that something's up.\n\n503\n00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:21,720\nIt doesn't really look, unless you have\nan extremely active target, it doesn't\n\n504\n00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,990\nlook right to have a bunch of connections\nsimultaneously open to a website and start\n\n505\n00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,870\njust sucking down all its content and\nthe store owner going, what's going on?\n\n506\n00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,420\n>> Site dump, site dump.\n\n507\n00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,764\n>> Yeah, they'll pick it up, so yeah,\n\n508\n00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:38,490\nyou kinda gotta be really careful\nwith the way you do this.\n\n509\n00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:44,690\nSo, just to kind of give you\nan idea of how this works.\n\n510\n00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:52,040\nWhat I've got on my system here\nis I have the BlackWidow program.\n\n511\n00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,940\nThis is one that you can get, I believe\nit's what, Softbyte or something?\n\n512\n00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,890\n>> I was just looking that up,\nit's Softbyte Labs and\n\n513\n00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,060\nI'll throw the link in there for\neverybody.\n\n514\n00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,619\n>> Yeah, so and I didn't see that.\n\n515\n00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:06,760\nBrian here mentioned Wget.\n\n516\n00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,190\n>> One of my faves, I'll throw the link\nin there for that one as well.\n\n517\n00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:09,740\n>> Yeah.\n\n518\n00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,070\nYeah, you can do that.\n\n519\n00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:16,290\nThere's a Linux version,\nthere is a Unix version,\n\n520\n00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:17,920\nand there's a Windows version of that too.\n\n521\n00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,440\nSo you choose which one is\nmost appropriate for you,\n\n522\n00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,140\nwhich one you're most comfortable with.\n\n523\n00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,940\nSo what I've got here is,\nI've got my own personal website.\n\n524\n00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,920\nWhat I've done is, you put in\nthe address up top of the website.\n\n525\n00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,870\nAnd so what it does is, Black Widow brings\nit up and then what you do is you can\n\n526\n00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,960\ngo over to the Scanner section, say\nwhere you wanna download the website to.\n\n527\n00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,310\nSo I have a section on my computer\nhere I want to download it to.\n\n528\n00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:56,350\nSo once I'm ready, I just hit Start and\nit will start bringing the stuff down.\n\n529\n00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,451\nI would start the scan here, but\nthis is hosted on someone else's server.\n\n530\n00:30:00,451 --> 00:30:02,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't own the server, it's shared,\n\n531\n00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,490\nso we know the rules on that.\n\n532\n00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,060\n>> That's right.\n\n533\n00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:10,470\n>> You can see down here, if we do a full\nscreen, it's hidden under my head here.\n\n534\n00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,470\nIn the bottom right you'll see\nthat it has Maximum connections.\n\n535\n00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:17,920\nMaximum connections, this is\nsomething that I was talking about,\n\n536\n00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,630\nis you can say how many\nconnections open up to a site.\n\n537\n00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,840\nThe more you open,\nthe more visible you are gonna be.\n\n538\n00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,680\nSo you're trying to kind\nof keep your head down.\n\n539\n00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,680\nRemember, you have to\nbe patient about this.\n\n540\n00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,500\nYou can't just go ahead and do it.\n\n541\n00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,638\nYou'll also notice underneath\nthe Maximum connections\n\n542\n00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:43,142\ncheck we also have an option\nto slow down the scan.\n\n543\n00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,220\nSo, we can see it right here it says,\nSlowdown the scan.\n\n544\n00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,350\nWhat you can do is, that will actually,\nif you decide that it's a very big site,\n\n545\n00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,730\nor a lot of stuff you have to download.\n\n546\n00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:00,035\nAnd by default this scanner goes down,\nwhat is it, three levels, I believe.\n\n547\n00:31:00,035 --> 00:31:01,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n548\n00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:06,190\n>> So it means it goes from the top and\nthen down from there three steps.\n\n549\n00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,040\nAnd anything below that, it's not gonna\nfollow links or anything else that far.\n\n550\n00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,730\nIt's gonna say, this is it.\n\n551\n00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,970\nAnd it does that for safety reasons.\n\n552\n00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,540\nThat's the default reason it does that.\n\n553\n00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,160\nIt does that for safety reasons,\nbecause it's trying to\n\n554\n00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,370\nlimit the amount of traffic and\nlimit you from getting a very huge site.\n\n555\n00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,050\nBecause they found traditionally\nonce you go down three links,\n\n556\n00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,595\nI mean good website design typically,\nit typically says,\n\n557\n00:31:30,595 --> 00:31:33,950\nwell don't go down more than three levels.\n\n558\n00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,240\nThat was the rule of thumb for\na long time.\n\n559\n00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,282\nAnd some people still adhere to it,\nsome people don't.\n\n560\n00:31:39,282 --> 00:31:42,717\nBut they figure, once you go past\nthat third level, it's just,\n\n561\n00:31:42,717 --> 00:31:45,036\nit gets like a bird's nest, it goes crazy.\n\n562\n00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,379\nAnd stuff starts opening\nup all over the place.\n\n563\n00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:52,078\nSo you really wanna think if you wanna\ngo down past three levels if you do, or\n\n564\n00:31:52,078 --> 00:31:56,852\nyou find out those first three levels\nhave a lot of content on it, and again,\n\n565\n00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:59,200\nbrowse your target first.\n\n566\n00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,810\nThat looks like normal traffic and if you\nfind out there's a lot of stuff there,\n\n567\n00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,110\nthen what you do is you\njust slow down that scan.\n\n568\n00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,400\n>> Right.\n>> You know, that way it'll take longer,\n\n569\n00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,550\nof course.\n\n570\n00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,170\nBut, it's gonna be less visible.\n\n571\n00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, there's the things.\n\n572\n00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,807\nOnce you do that,\ngo ahead and hit Start Scan.\n\n573\n00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:23,544\nAnd then, just walk away, or\ndo something else or whatever.\n\n574\n00:32:23,544 --> 00:32:24,790\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n575\n00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,173\nAnd these are invaluable\nto be able to get there,\n\n576\n00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:30,760\nyou're basically able to get that content,\nget it offline.\n\n577\n00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,877\nAnd now, I can take by time hammering\nat it, not really hammering at it, but\n\n578\n00:32:33,877 --> 00:32:35,700\nlooking through it, browsing through it.\n\n579\n00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,030\nTrying to figure out what information\nI can glean from the content they're\n\n580\n00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,410\ndelivering.\n\n581\n00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,420\nTrying to look at maybe some of the source\ncode on some of those HTML pages cuz\n\n582\n00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,810\nI'm sure we're going to cover that later.\n\n583\n00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,360\nThere's a lot of information.\n\n584\n00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,690\nSometimes these programmers don't\nthink about security and they put some\n\n585\n00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,370\ninformation in the code that probably\nshouldn't be exposed to the outside world.\n\n586\n00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,230\nThere's a lot of things I can gain.\n\n587\n00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,050\nAnd this is probably not\nthe place to talk about it, but\n\n588\n00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,200\none of the other things I\nthink these actually fit in,\n\n589\n00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,255\nthese [INAUDIBLE] you get in Black Widow\nis trying to host a website, right?\n\n590\n00:33:06,255 --> 00:33:08,735\nRight.\nWhat if I wanted to do some phishing, and\n\n591\n00:33:08,735 --> 00:33:10,945\nI want to get all of Sean's customers?\n\n592\n00:33:10,945 --> 00:33:14,845\nI can basically host a website that\nlooks just like Sean's website.\n\n593\n00:33:14,845 --> 00:33:17,614\nNow some of the links might not work,\nsome of the behind the scenes scripts and\n\n594\n00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:19,335\nstuff like that might not function.\n\n595\n00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:24,435\nBut I could use this program, download\nall those images and all those texts and\n\n596\n00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:28,450\nHTML content, host on a web\nserver of my own creation, and\n\n597\n00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,090\nthen send somebody a link and say hey\nclick here to go check out Sean's site,\n\n598\n00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,370\nit comes to me and maybe do some\ninformation grabbing there, right.\n\n599\n00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,190\nDo a little social engineering so.\n\n600\n00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,945\n>> Exactly.\n\n601\n00:33:38,945 --> 00:33:39,905\n>> Pretty cool tools.\n\n602\n00:33:39,905 -->

right?\n\n613\n00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,020\nSo the first thing we do is we footprint.\n\n614\n00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,660\nRight?\nWe gather all the information we\n\n615\n00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,970\ncan about that intended target,\nthat web server.\n\n616\n00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,290\nThen we start moving in to\ngather more information,\n\n617\n00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,350\nwe start mirroring that website.\n\n618\n00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,420\nUsing one of these tools maybe to spider\nacross it, download a copy of that.\n\n619\n00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,720\nNow that we've got all this information,\nwhat are we really looking at?\n\n620\n00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,310\nSo I've pulled your site down to\nmy computer, what am I looking for\n\n621\n00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,990\nwhat am I looking at?\n\n622\n00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,070\n>> You touched on some of it there,\nlike the stuff that's hidden.\n\n623\n00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,500\nThose hidden

standing here\n\n626\n00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:47,040\nsaying, if you put comments in your\nwebsite you're horrible person,\n\n627\n00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,420\nand you should be fired or\nanything like that.\n\n628\n00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,450\n>> I love comments.\n\n629\n00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,238\n>> Yeah, comments are a great thing.\n\n630\n00:34:52,238 --> 00:34:58,120\nI mean comments, if you're gonna put 'em\nin a site, put 'em where you need to\n\n631\n00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:03,730\njust in case someone needs to follow\nin your footsteps or you're not working\n\n632\n00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,990\nthat project for awhile you can figure\nout what was going through your own head.\n\n633\n00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,900\n>> Yeah, I feel stupid sometimes but\nthat's exactly why I put most of\n\n634\n00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,900\nmy comments in there is because I'll\nwork on something, I'll research it and\n\n635\n00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,300\ntake hours-\n>> Jogging your memory?\n\n636\n00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,100\n>> Trying to figure it out and\nget it to working just right and\n\n637\n00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,910\nthen you don't touch it for six months and\nyou come back and you look at it\n\n638\n00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,930\nsix months later and you're like, what the\nheck did I do here and why did I do it?\n\n639\n00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,625\nIt works, but what was it?\n\n640\n00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,055\nComments are there to help you\nremember what you did, why you did it.\n\n641\n00:35:30,055 --> 00:35:32,175\nOr as you said other administrators\nthat come behind you,\n\n642\n00:35:32,175 --> 00:35:33,755\nthey can understand why you did it.\n\n643\n00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:36,635\nBut you don't have to\nput like IP addresses\n\n644\n00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,205\nof your other servers in the comments and\nthings like that.\n\n645\n00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:42,765\nSo we can be smart about\nwhat we're putting in there.\n\n646\n00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:48,040\n>> Yeah, and even at that there's a lot\nof development tools that will strip out\n\n647\n00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,760\ncomments too, when you put a production\nweb site, when you put production content\n\n648\n00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,170\nup someplace, what will happen is\nthat it strips them out, you're fine.\n\n649\n00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:04,900\nSo you still have development code\nsitting there with your comments in,\n\n650\n00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,430\nbut you don't have it going out in\nthe world where someone could download it\n\n651\n00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,640\nusing a website downloader,\nread the comments.\n\n652\n00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,820\nThose comments, I've seen it, probably,\na good number of you can see it.\n\n653\n00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,550\nYou're going to see situations where\npeople put some very sensitive stuff that\n\n654\n00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,110\nshouldn't be there.\n\n655\n00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:27,090\nThey'll say what servers are attaching to,\nor why they put code a certain way.\n\n656\n00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:31,140\nAnd, it's enough, if someones in the know,\nto look at those things and\n\n657\n00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,270\ntake all those little pieces and even put\ntogether with stuff they've learned in\n\n658\n00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,560\nother places and\nget that picture of what's happening and\n\n659\n00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,790\nit's just a matter of figuring out how\nyou're gonna strike at that point.\n\n660\n00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,130\n>> Exactly.\n\n661\n00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,190\nI was trying, I think most browsers\nthere's usually a keyboard shortcut that I\n\n662\n00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,790\ncan do to view the source code on a page.\n\n663\n00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:50,520\nAnd if I downloaded it, even easier.\n\n664\n00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:56,190\n>> Yeah, that's a common feature\nthat you have in a lot of browsers.\n\n665\n00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:00,370\nSo, but, anyway,\n\n666\n00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:04,858\nsome other things that I would,\njust to kinda mention some other things.\n\n667\n00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:06,606\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n668\n00:37:06,606 --> 00:37:08,310\n>> Only looks back in your work and\n\n669\n00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,595\nthink what were you smoking?\n\n670\n00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:10,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n671\n00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,140\nYes, I think we've all had that.\n\n672\n00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,954\nWe've all wondered what\nyou're smoking [LAUGH].\n\n673\n00:37:17,954 --> 00:37:20,430\n>> [LAUGH] That's good.\n\n674\n00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,460\n>> We've all had those times.\n\n675\n00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,940\nI've been there too where I've dock stuff\nin code and it's like what was I doing?\n\n676\n00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,710\nMan.\n>> It made perfectly good sense when you\n\n677\n00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,990\nwere writing that code.\n\n678\n00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,120\nAnd then you look back at it later,\nand you're like what the heck?\n\n679\n00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,800\nAnd of course I've got none of the\nbookmarks I used when I did my research or\n\n680\n00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,860\nanything like that.\n\n681\n00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,850\nSo I'm just like okay,\ngotta start all over again.\n\n682\n00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:44,205\nSo comments are definitely good, we just\ngotta be smart about what we put in there.\n\n683\n00:37:44,205 --> 00:37:46,435\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n684\n00:37:46,435 --> 00:37:48,750\n>> [LAUGH] And lay off the smoke maybe.\n\n685\n00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,580\nIt might the code I don't know.\n\n686\n00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,910\n>> Yeah.\nLay off the smoke.\n\n687\n00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,390\nThe brownies,\nwhatever else it is you've got involved.\n\n688\n00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:01,220\nSome other things that\nare really good to note.\n\n689\n00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,840\nAlso and here just to give you kind\nof some other pictures of things.\n\n690\n00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,520\nJust to go through Black Widow again.\n\n691\n00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,583\nBlack Widow, what I've got here on\nscreen is there's two other features,\n\n692\n00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:15,364\none called Net Spy and one called Emails.\n\n693\n00:38:15,364 --> 00:38:17,597\nNet Spy, I've run the thing, and\n\n694\n00:38:17,597 --> 00:38:22,217\nit's telling me stuff about connections,\nand then I've got down here\n\n695\n00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:26,310\nconnections at my website actually\nopens up to another place.\n\n696\n00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:31,284\nI mean this is saying it can go into\nsomeplace and Google, this is for\n\n697\n00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:34,890\na theme that I'm actually using,\non the stuff.\n\n698\n00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,790\nI mean, yeah,\nthe links don't make sense to me either.\n\n699\n00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,900\nFredericka the great.\n\n700\n00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,655\nI don't even know what that is.\n\n701\n00:38:39,655 --> 00:38:40,960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Must be some sort of font or\n\n702\n00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,012\nsomething like that.\n\n703\n00:38:42,012 --> 00:38:44,510\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n704\n00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n705\n00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:48,930\nI don't smoke, so this ain't me.\n\n706\n00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,210\nI'm crazy enough without it.\n\n707\n00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:57,770\nThen you have this one under emails,\nit will actually harvest emails for you.\n\n708\n00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,508\nSo this one scanned my site,\nit's got a couple of emails now.\n\n709\n00:39:01,508 --> 00:39:06,380\nYou lost OC by the way, this is a good\ncase, if we can maybe zoom in a bit here.\n\n710\n00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,180\nI'm not worried about\nthese email addresses.\n\n711\n00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,960\nIf you look at it, that 33 mail,\n\n712\n00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,940\nthat was something I mentioned\nin our earlier episodes.\n\n713\n00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,330\nI'm not going to put my\nGmail up there at all.\n\n714\n00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,690\nIt ain't gonna happen.\n\n715\n00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,321\nI do have a Gmail account that I use for\n\n716\n00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:33,155\nsome of my normal traffic and\nstuff like that.\n\n717\n00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:37,364\nI'm not gonna put that there cuz I'll get\ntons of spam and all this other stuff, so\n\n718\n00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:39,456\nwhat I do is I put these\nemails on my site.\n\n719\n00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:43,028\nAnd if you email something through\na form it goes to that email and\n\n720\n00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:45,800\nthen that gets forwarded\non to my Gmail account.\n\n721\n00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,360\nSo you'll never see my Gmail\naccount pop up any place.\n\n722\n00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,000\nAnd so\n\n723\n00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,120\nby keeping it obscured like that, It's\nnot gonna show up on the mailing list.\n\n724\n00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,740\nIt's not, or anything like that.\n\n725\n00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:58,640\nIt's also not gonna be something that\nyou can use to really foot print me.\n\n726\n00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,930\nIf you try to foot print that email\naddress that I have showing up here,\n\n727\n00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:04,165\neither one of those email\naddresses I have showing up there,\n\n728\n00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:06,370\nyou're not gonna get anywhere.\n\n729\n00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,640\n>> Right.\n\n730\n00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,110\n>> You just will not get anywhere at all\nbecause I know exactly where it came from,\n\n731\n00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,560\nthose only exist on this site.\n\n732\n00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,850\nThere's nothing behind them.\n\n733\n00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,518\nYou can't really do anything like that.\n\n734\n00:40:16,518 --> 00:40:20,790\n>> Yeah, and that's something\nwe've always had to worry about,\n\n735\n00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,230\npeople spider websites for emails.\n\n736\n00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:26,460\nI remember back in the day we had\ncompany directories on the website with\n\n737\n00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,050\neverybody's email address out there,\ncontact me thing and\n\n738\n00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,900\njust can't do that anymore unless\nyou want a pocket full of spam.\n\n739\n00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,000\n>> Yeah, you'll be inundated\nby a mess of things for\n\n740\n00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,900\nhome loans and pills and\neverything else, so.\n\n741\n00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,350\n>> Right.\n>> You can't do that.\n\n742\n00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:48,600\nYou have to figure out\nanother way to do it.\n\n743\n00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,610\nIn my case, this is the way I use it, cuz\nI know that spiders are gonna go through\n\n744\n00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,930\nthat code and see it, and\nthey're specifically designed to do that.\n\n745\n00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,810\nSo I just went through and\ntook that opportunity away from you.\n\n746\n00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:00,390\n>> Yeah.\n\n747\n00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,870\nAnd there's a couple guys in the chat\nroom that I think Davis mentioned.\n\n748\n00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,390\n>> There are other email\nmasking techniques.\n\n749\n00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:09,060\nI've seen people going as far to\nput an image of their email address\n\n750\n00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,930\nrather than the email address in text,\nwhich sometimes works depending on,\n\n751\n00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:18,500\nyou know, the techniques they use do get\nbetter as well, adding a few letters, or\n\n752\n00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,340\nleaving out the at,\nthe dot com, or something.\n\n753\n00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,980\nAnd then people have to put that in for\n\n754\n00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,000\nit to actually work,\ncuz there's another good thing.\n\n755\n00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,650\nBut, you know, as we develop these\ntechniques, the bad guys pick up on them,\n\n756\n00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,000\nand they get OCR,\n\n757\n00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,420\nyou know that they can pick up some of\nthose images and convert it back to text.\n\n758\n00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:37,530\nThey can grab things that look\nlike an email address and\n\n759\n00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,960\nput a dot com on the end of it just\nto see if works, things like that.\n\n760\n00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,220\nThere's always just a combination\nof different techniques to try to\n\n761\n00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,830\nhide that stuff.\n\n762\n00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,130\nSo with the mirroring,\nit gives us the opportunity again,\n\n763\n00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,210\nas you said earlier, to really go through\nthat website in an offline format,\n\n764\n00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,630\nwe're not making contact with\nthat server all day long,\n\n765\n00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:00,560\npossibly raising red flags and\nable to take my time looking at that.\n\n766\n00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,950\nSo another thing that we might\nwant to do to a web server,\n\n767\n00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,539\nis see what kind of vulnerabilities\nthat that web server might have.\n\n768\n00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:14,510\nBut looking at our clock, we're getting\nclose, I don't know, can we fit this in?\n\n769\n00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,550\nWanna try to get our vulnerability\nscans in real quick or\n\n770\n00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,660\ndo you wanna make them\nwait until after break.\n\n771\n00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,946\n>> Yeah, you guys can go look it up.\n\n772\n00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:24,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What, it's late in the day.\n\n773\n00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,340\nI don't wanna work any more.\n\n774\n00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,990\nWhat's going on?\n\n775\n00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,812\nLunch is starting to set in.\n\n776\n00:42:29,812 --> 00:42:32,360\n>> All right, so we're gonna let\nShaun take a little break here, and\n\n777\n00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,830\nwhen we come back we're gonna continue on\nwith our web servers and web applications.\n\n778\n00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:39,815\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n779\n00:42:39,815 --> 00:42:46,170\n[SOUND]\nAlright.\n\n780\n00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,730\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n781\n00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,880\nContinuing on with our web servers and\nweb applications.\n\n782\n00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,470\nGetting ready to talk about some of the\nother techniques we might use to attack\n\n783\n00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:55,970\na web server.\n\n784\n00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,290\nSpecifically vulnerability scanning,\n\n785\n00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,470\nwhich we've kinda already talked\nabout in some other segments, right?\n\n786\n00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:08,440\nYes, we have discussed that but\nwe have to bring it back in, back in here.\n\n787\n00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:15,160\nWhat we gotta do is think about where web,\nwhere vulnerability scanning would fit in.\n\n788\n00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,920\nAnd we actually can use things like\nNessus, we can use things like Nexpose,\n\n789\n00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,070\nfrom Rapid7, which here would actually\nbe a particularly good choice for you.\n\n790\n00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,895\nAnd let me, I don't want to\ndo a product endorsement for\n\n791\n00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,165\nit because they're not\npaying me enough for that.\n\n792\n00:43:31,165 --> 00:43:35,255\nBut, [LAUGH] I don't wanna do\na product endorsement on this, but\n\n793\n00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:41,355\nit is worth mentioning, one of the things\nthat we can use when we do pen testing is,\n\n794\n00:43:41,355 --> 00:43:45,675\nespecially true for\nweb applications, is Metasploit.\n\n795\n00:43:45,675 --> 00:43:50,325\nMetasploit, undoubtedly there's a good\nnumber of you that have heard of that.\n\n796\n00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:57,270\nWhat Metasploit is for\nthose who that don't know, it's a way\n\n797\n00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,400\nto test a web applications and\nas well as web servers.\n\n798\n00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,490\nYou can do that, it's a tool that's\nused extensively to test those areas for\n\n799\n00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:06,450\nexample.\n\n800\n00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:09,390\nYou can do things like\ntest buffer overflows.\n\n801\n00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:12,520\nYou can do things like\ntest problems with code,\n\n802\n00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,080\nyou know, all sorts of interesting stuff.\n\n803\n00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,270\nReason why I'm going to tell you that\nif you're doing vulnerability scanning,\n\n804\n00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:22,350\nNessus is great.\n\n805\n00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,530\nI'm not going to take any shots at it,\nbecause it is a very good product.\n\n806\n00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,800\nRapid 7's a good product as well, but\n\n807\n00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,000\nbecause Rapid 7 integrates\nwith Metasploit.\n\n808\n00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,430\nYou can do a vulnerability\nscan with Nexpose, and\n\n809\n00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,210\nthen send the stuff right over to\nMetasploit to do a further analysis on it.\n\n810\n00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:42,730\nSince some of you will be\nusing those tools together, or\n\n811\n00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:47,290\nusing Metasploit at least, you might wanna\nconsider saying okay well maybe Nexpose\n\n812\n00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:51,070\nis a good thing to use cuz the two work\ntogether, it will save you some time.\n\n813\n00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:51,975\nYou don't have to.\n\n814\n00:44:51,975 --> 00:44:53,597\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So it can be done with either one, but\n\n815\n00:44:53,597 --> 00:44:55,750\nit's nice that they integrate and\nwork together.\n\n816\n00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:58,160\nAnd I don't have to treat\nit as separate processes.\n\n817\n00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:01,530\nYeah, exactly, it's a time saver.\n\n818\n00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,780\nYou're going to have a lot to do.\n\n819\n00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,290\nThat's my thing.\n\n820\n00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,640\nYou're going to have a lot to do.\n\n821\n00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,850\nYou might as well save time and\neffort wherever you can.\n\n822\n00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,750\nSo, this is just something\nI put out there.\n\n823\n00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,990\nLike I said, I'm not setting this\nto be a product endorsement, or\n\n824\n00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,770\nanything like that.\n\n825\n00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:22,680\nIt's just a case of I wanna point that out\nthat that might be a better option for\n\n826\n00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,390\nyou in this case, but think about it.\n\n827\n00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,328\nWhen I come in tomorrow,\nthe shirt says Rapid7 or something on it.\n\n828\n00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:31,830\n>> [LAUGH] It's like what,\nwhat are you talking about, man?\n\n829\n00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,685\n[LAUGH]\n>> They called you last night and\n\n830\n00:45:33,685 --> 00:45:36,733\nsaid hey, we're gonna up your money,\ngood product endorsement.\n\n831\n00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,149\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n832\n00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:38,905\n>> All right, so\n\n833\n00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:44,285\nvulnerability scanning in relation to\nweb servers and web applications, and\n\n834\n00:45:44,285 --> 00:45:47,415\nwe're doing the same thing that we talked\nabout way back when, we're looking for\n\n835\n00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:51,005\nvulnerabilities, it's just that now we're\nkind of focusing on a web server, right?\n\n836\n00:45:51,005 --> 00:45:54,490\nSo we're just bringing the same tools\nto bear just in a different part of our\n\n837\n00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:55,930\nattack phase.\n\n838\n00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:56,950\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n839\n00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:58,890\nLike I said,\nthese are all building blocks.\n\n840\n00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,880\nAll the things are building blocks,\n\n841\n00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,060\nyou have to figure out\nways to put them together.\n\n842\n00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,640\nWe're only talking about,\n\n843\n00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,590\nyou know, certain ways to\nput them together right now.\n\n844\n00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:14,060\nPlease do not take that as\nthis is the only way to do it.\n\n845\n00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,250\nBe creative try different things,\nsometimes, like I said,\n\n846\n00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,870\nyou gotta break a few eggs, all right.\n\n847\n00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:22,920\nDo it, break a few eggs.\n\n848\n00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,340\nTry some stuff in testing and\nsee which ones works.\n\n849\n00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,746\nI just told you about an Nexpose,\nor Nexpose in Metasploit.\n\n850\n00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,020\nSome of you [INAUDIBLE] might say, well,\n\n851\n00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,575\nI don't do it that way at all,\nall right, well, okay.\n\n852\n00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:36,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you get good results.\n\n853\n00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:38,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> Still successful.\n\n854\n00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,110\nJust different methods,\ndifferent tools that we use.\n\n855\n00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:44,120\nAnd that's something that Shaun stressed\nway back in the early episodes is as we\n\n856\n00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:47,650\ngo through all of this there's several\ndifferent tools that perform the same, or\n\n857\n00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,320\nvery similar functions.\n\n858\n00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:53,930\nYou need to have a familiarity, the exam\nwith the concept, what the tool does,\n\n859\n00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,160\nwhere I would use it.\n\n860\n00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,900\nBut not really one specific\ntool except in certain cases.\n\n861\n00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,370\nThey call out the best of breeds like\nNmap, Wireshark First Scanners, and\n\n862\n00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:03,139\nthings like that.\n\n863\n00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:06,600\nBut in general, you need to be able\nto understand what the tool does,\n\n864\n00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,000\nwhat I would use it for.\n\n865\n00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,955\nWhich particular one you use\nis a matter of preference,\n\n866\n00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:14,410\nwhichever one you can obtain for the least\namount of money or the one that works best\n\n867\n00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:17,150\nin your scenario or the one that\nyou're more comfortable work in.\n\n868\n00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,885\nRight, so there's choices.\n\n869\n00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:20,320\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> It's good to have choices.\n\n870\n00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,200\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n871\n00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,749\n>> Right.\n>> Evaluate, evaluate, evaluate,\n\n872\n00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:31,716\nthere's a lot of lists out there and\nsites that have extensive lists of tools.\n\n873\n00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,248\nStart getting busy doing that.\n\n874\n00:47:33,248 --> 00:47:34,432\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n875\n00:47:34,432 --> 00:47:37,021\nSet up a little sandbox,\nkeep it safe and play in there.\n\n876\n00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:37,788\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n877\n00:47:37,788 --> 00:47:40,214\nOther things for attacking a Web server.\n\n878\n00:47:40,214 --> 00:47:42,820\nAgain, more of the same that we've\ntalked about earlier this session.\n\n879\n00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,040\nHijacking as another method\nI could take advantage of or\n\n880\n00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,030\nuse when I'm going against a Web server.\n\n881\n00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,340\nYeah, session hijacking does\npoke its head out again here.\n\n882\n00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,940\nWe talked about session\nhijacking yesterday.\n\n883\n00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:58,460\nAnd we talked about it today as well.\n\n884\n00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,190\nWas it today?\n\n885\n00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:00,540\n>> They all blur together.\n\n886\n00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,007\nSo, if you're watching the recording\nyesterday, today, tomorrow, it's all good.\n\n887\n00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,043\n[LAUGH]\n>> Do I look like a professional people?\n\n888\n00:48:06,043 --> 00:48:09,690\n>> [LAUGH] We've had that\nquestion a couple of times now.\n\n889\n00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,360\n>> Yeah.\n\n890\n00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,410\nYeah, they've asked that here.\n\n891\n00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:15,550\nEvery day I come in they're like aren't\nyou gonna act like a professional?\n\n892\n00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:18,241\n>> The bridge is over there, no.\n\n893\n00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:21,980\n[LAUGH]\nBut yeah, so vulnerability.\n\n894\n00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:26,394\nI mean our session hijacking can\ndefinitely take a place in this type\n\n895\n00:48:26,394 --> 00:48:27,890\nof attack as well.\n\n896\n00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:28,880\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n897\n00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,230\nSession high jacking's at network level.\n\n898\n00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:37,980\nAnd we said application level, and so\nwe're talking about the application level.\n\n899\n00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:38,530\n>> Right.\n\n900\n00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,770\n>> And when we get to this, even though\nwe're still on the Web server side,\n\n901\n00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,460\nit doesn't mean you won't see session IDs.\n\n902\n00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,170\nThey're probably not going to be\nheld the same weight that they do\n\n903\n00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:52,400\non the Web application side, but\nit's still possible you might see that.\n\n904\n00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,270\nLike when you login to something.\n\n905\n00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:59,050\nYou can say, even though you're\njust doing a simple login,\n\n906\n00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:01,160\nyou could very well see\na session ID in there.\n\n907\n00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,600\nSo just something to think about.\n\n908\n00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,800\n>> Another method we might bring to\nbear on a Web server would be obtaining\n\n909\n00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,990\npasswords.\n\n910\n00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:11,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> Kind of makes sense, right?\n\n911\n00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,990\nIf I've got a Web server that's requiring\nauthentication and if I can get somebody's\n\n912\n00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:19,840\npassword, I can use those same techniques\nwe talked about in previous episodes to\n\n913\n00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:24,916\ngain those passwords, and then I can use\nthat as my attack against that Web server.\n\n914\n00:49:24,916 --> 00:49:33,070\nYes, it's 100% correct is that you can\nobtain passwords against a Web server.\n\n915\n00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,390\nPretty much using a lot of the same\nmethods that you saw before.\n\n916\n00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:41,900\nHowever, it is worth noting that there are\nsome custom password crackers designed for\n\n917\n00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,250\nattacking password on Web servers.\n\n918\n00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,800\nOne that's been around for\nawhile is Brutus.\n\n919\n00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,450\nBrutus hasn't been updated in years.\n\n920\n00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:52,750\nActually I just looked at it,\n\n921\n00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,780\none of the earlier breaks, you know\nthe last time that thing was updated?\n\n922\n00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,320\n15 years ago.\n\n923\n00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:58,870\n>> Really?\n\n924\n00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,675\n>> 15 years ago, I think, it was updated.\n\n925\n00:50:00,675 --> 00:50:02,330\nYeah.\n[LAUGH] >> It's still an effective tool.\n\n926\n00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,850\n>> Yeah, it said 15 years ago oh,\nand two months.\n\n927\n00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,545\nIt said 15 years ago and two months.\n\n928\n00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,588\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So sorry,\n\n929\n00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:10,260\nI wasn't as accurate as I\nshould have been on that.\n\n930\n00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,800\nLike wow, okay.\n\n931\n00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,170\n>> All right.\n\n932\n00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:14,800\n>> So that's one.\n\n933\n00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,480\nThere's another one.\n\n934\n00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,740\nTHC Hydra,\n\n935\n00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:21,900\nthat's another one that's around that does\nspecifically against Web applications.\n\n936\n00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,200\nThere's Medusa and\na whole bunch of other ones out there\n\n937\n00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,780\nthat are specifically tailored for\nthe, for this environment.\n\n938\n00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:36,300\nSo you just gotta kinda take your pick and\ntry some of the different ones in here.\n\n939\n00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,220\nThe thing is that I'll you about these\npassword cracking utilities is a lot\n\n940\n00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,800\nof the ones on the website, you actually\nhave to supply your own dictionary list.\n\n941\n00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,740\nWhich is the text file that has all the\nnames inside of it that it's going to try\n\n942\n00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,340\nand password combination it's gonna try.\n\n943\n00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:54,900\nThe cool think about that is,\n\n944\n00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,150\nit sounds like it's a drawback,\nwhy don't you include it?\n\n945\n00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:59,620\nI can't use it without it.\n\n946\n00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,120\nThey include a small one, but\nthat small one is gonna do\n\n947\n00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:07,980\nonly a small handful of the ones\nthat are seen commonly.\n\n948\n00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:14,280\nWhat these dictionary lists you can\ndownload from the Internet are some of\n\n949\n00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:19,650\nthose include several million passwords\nand username combinations in them so.\n\n950\n00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:26,370\nYou can get them in different languages\nand stuff like that and go from there.\n\n951\n00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,720\nSo it makes it a very versatile\ntool by them not including it, or\n\n952\n00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:34,390\nsaying you go get it, you go get what you\nneed and make it more suitable to your\n\n953\n00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:37,560\nspecific situation instead of something\nthat we don't know ahead of time.\n\n954\n00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,330\n>> Right.\n\n955\n00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,460\n>> Yeah so.\n>> The advantage of having a huge\n\n956\n00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:43,050\ndictionary file is that it's got\nall those different options and\n\n957\n00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,750\nthat also means that it's going\nto take forever to rifle through,\n\n958\n00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:48,570\nor a longer period of time to\nrifle through all those options.\n\n959\n00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:51,320\nIf you can tailor that to\nthat particular scenario,\n\n960\n00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,650\nyou may have different dictionary files\nthat you use in different scenarios.\n\n961\n00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,340\nI have dictionary files,\nI can have the Webster's Dictionary.\n\n962\n00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:01,330\nAnd a dictionary files are very simple\nfile that you can make yourself,\n\n963\n00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:06,520\nit's just a text document that has\none word on each line typically and\n\n964\n00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,050\nit's just gonna rifle through that.\n\n965\n00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:11,280\nSo if you want to make your own, open up\nnotepad, start typing out all the possible\n\n966\n00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:16,080\npasswords, and then you give it to that\nprogram and it uses it as its source for\n\n967\n00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,430\nguessing those passwords.\n\n968\n00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:18,426\nAnd like you said,\n\n969\n00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,675\nyou can get and I've got files like common\nFrench names, common Spanish names.\n\n970\n00:52:22,675 --> 00:52:27,269\nAnd you know hackers are geeks, too,\nso don't think your Klingon passwords\n\n971\n00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,944\nare safe because we can get text\nfiles in Klingon and Elvish and\n\n972\n00:52:30,944 --> 00:52:34,425\nthings like that as well so\njust something to keep in mind.\n\n973\n00:52:34,425 --> 00:52:39,105\n[LAUGH]\n>> How do you spell Kaplah?\n\n974\n00:52:39,105 --> 00:52:41,250\nHow many apostrophes are in that?\n\n975\n00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,830\n>> One vowel, 14 consonants,\nand three apostrophes.\n\n976\n00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:48,379\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so\n\n977\n00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:51,138\nlots of things I can do to\nattack this Web server.\n\n978\n00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:55,222\nWe got our footprinting where we''re gonna\ngather information about that server.\n\n979\n00:52:55,222 --> 00:52:57,672\nGet information about what the heck it is,\nwhat it's running.\n\n980\n00:52:57,672 --> 00:53:00,092\nSo we find some vulnerabilities\nmaybe that way.\n\n981\n00:53:00,092 --> 00:53:04,370\nMirroring that website, bringing that\ninformation down to your local machine so\n\n982\n00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,966\nthat I can take my time and go through and\nlook at all the source code and\n\n983\n00:53:07,966 --> 00:53:11,720\nfarm valuable information there and\nlook for vulnerabilities.\n\n984\n00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:15,120\nVulnerability scanning,\nlike we talked about in previous episodes.\n\n985\n00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,400\nScanning that machine, looking for known\nvulnerabilities, and you'll be surprised\n\n986\n00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,130\nhow many server out there are not\npatched against known vulnerabilities.\n\n987\n00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,130\nA session hijacking,\n\n988\n00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:27,650\ntrying to grab somebody that's\nalready authenticated to that website.\n\n989\n00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:32,440\nTake over their session, password cracking\nusing some of the tools Shawn mentioned\n\n990\n00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,700\nto try to break that password.\n\n991\n00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,000\nSo lots of different avenues\nof attack on a Web server.\n\n992\n00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:40,380\nWeb servers have a lot of flaws.\n\n993\n00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,350\nWe always hear the horror\nstories especially\n\n994\n00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:46,650\nIIS gets a pretty bad\nrap most of the time.\n\n995\n00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:48,030\nIt's definitely got some flaws, and\n\n996\n00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:51,980\nwe should probably be familiar with some\nof those common Web server flaws, huh?\n\n997\n00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:52,810\n>> Yeah.\nI mean,\n\n998\n00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,855\nIIS has more holes than Swiss cheese.\n\n999\n00:53:54,855 --> 00:53:56,392\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n1000\n00:53:56,392 --> 00:54:00,140\n>> Sorry [CROSSTALK]\n>> I am not paid endorser for Microsoft.\n\n1001\n00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,760\nI'm just gonna say that.\n\n1002\n00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,800\nI support that message.\n\n1003\n00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,010\nI approve this message, sorry.\n\n1004\n00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:08,840\n>> I approve this message.\n\n1005\n00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,118\n[LAUGH]\n>> But in all seriousness,\n\n1006\n00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:14,830\nevery Web server has its flaws.\n\n1007\n00:54:14,830 --> 00:54:18,580\nAnd a lot of them are unique\nto that specific platform and\n\n1008\n00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:20,950\nconfiguration, some of 'em are not.\n\n1009\n00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:26,970\n>> So to talk about some of the more\ngeneral ones that could apply anywhere,\n\n1010\n00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,360\none of the biggest we have\nwould be misconfiguration.\n\n1011\n00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,400\nAnd misconfiguration is huge.\n\n1012\n00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,140\nYou could talk about that for\nhours or longer and\n\n1013\n00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,890\nwe probably all have our stories that\nthose of us that work with Web servers,\n\n1014\n00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:46,450\nwe probably all have our stories\non mistakes we've encountered\n\n1015\n00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,990\nthat people have made or maybe we made.\n\n1016\n00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:51,820\nI made some mistakes early on\nin my career with Web servers,\n\n1017\n00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,730\nI probably still make them now.\n\n1018\n00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,470\nIt's hard to get everything.\n\n1019\n00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:02,060\nIt's just the way it work,\nwe see these things.\n\n1020\n00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:06,350\nBut if you find a flaw in a Web server,\nit can lead to other things,\n\n1021\n00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:11,420\nit can definitely lead to a lot of other\nthings, it could lead to someone being\n\n1022\n00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:16,340\nable to do direct retraversal,\nsomething that we'll talk about in a bit.\n\n1023\n00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:20,652\nIt could lead to,\nyou'll be able to run specific exploits\n\n1024\n00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:24,018\nwith something like Metasploit they could.\n\n1025\n00:55:24,018 --> 00:55:28,936\nThings like Nexpose and Nessus,\nand other vulnerability scanners\n\n1026\n00:55:28,936 --> 00:55:33,689\nwill look at a site and pick up\nthat there are certain flaws there.\n\n1027\n00:55:33,689 --> 00:55:37,391\nAnd then, you could also by doing\nthings like banner grabs and scans,\n\n1028\n00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:41,371\nwhich you can do, you can do banner\ngrabs and other types of scans for this.\n\n1029\n00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:45,684\nThrough NMAP, you might be able to\nidentify enough about the system to find\n\n1030\n00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:48,567\nyet other flaws,\nlike someone didn't patch it.\n\n1031\n00:55:48,567 --> 00:55:51,471\nAnd that may sound like, well duh, but\n\n1032\n00:55:51,471 --> 00:55:55,962\nthere's a lot of people that\ndon't patch their web server.\n\n1033\n00:55:55,962 --> 00:56:01,675\n>> Way too many, unfortunately.\n\n1034\n00:56:01,675 --> 00:56:05,455\n>> Yeah.\nThere was a good question I saw here\n\n1035\n00:56:05,455 --> 00:56:09,905\nearlier that I filed it away in the gray\nmatter cuz I knew it was gonna be hitting\n\n1036\n00:56:09,905 --> 00:56:11,675\nthis at some point.\n\n1037\n00:56:11,675 --> 00:56:16,529\nSomeone had asked in the groups, and\nI apologize, I forget who asked this.\n\n1038\n00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:24,270\nWhat the question was, was what about\nusing Microsoft's update to patch IES,\n\n1039\n00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:25,710\ndoes it work?\n\n1040\n00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:27,480\nYeah, it does work.\n\n1041\n00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,130\nBut also to kind of hit\non part of that question,\n\n1042\n00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,710\nthis is a personal preference thing.\n\n1043\n00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:36,500\nMike, you throw in your\nopinion in on this as well.\n\n1044\n00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:41,560\nBut I think you're asking can you\nset it to automatically update it?\n\n1045\n00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:47,590\nYeah, you can, but\nit seems to be the general consensus is\n\n1046\n00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:51,880\nis that people tend to refrain from doing\nautomatic updates on their servers.\n\n1047\n00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,740\nThat's for your client base and\nother stuff like that.\n\n1048\n00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:58,290\nYour servers, you have another system for\ndoing it manually so\n\n1049\n00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,300\nyou can make sure things are done\nthe right way and there's no glitches or\n\n1050\n00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,310\nanything like that and\nyou can properly evaluate stuff.\n\n1051\n00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:07,870\n>> Absolutely, and\nif you're curious on any of that,\n\n1052\n00:57:07,870 --> 00:57:09,420\ngo back over to our server classes.\n\n1053\n00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,020\nI spend a lot of time talking about\n\n1054\n00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:14,270\nsomething called Windows Deployment\nServices for a Windows environment.\n\n1055\n00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:18,380\nAt home, we should get our updates,\nat least the critical and security-related\n\n1056\n00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,890\nautomatically every night at 3 AM,\nyou know whatever the case may be.\n\n1057\n00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:23,610\nIn a corporate environment\nthough it's a little different.\n\n1058\n00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:27,120\nWe want to be able to test those updates\nbefore they get applied to my servers,\n\n1059\n00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,800\nbefore they get applied\nout to those clients.\n\n1060\n00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,190\nBecause it's bad enough if I'm at home and\n\n1061\n00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:34,210\nan update comes out and\nit causes a problem on my system.\n\n1062\n00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,080\nI don't wanna walk into work one day and\n\n1063\n00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,490\nfind out that it was patched Tuesday,\nsome update came out, and\n\n1064\n00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,340\nall my servers are blue screen or\nhalf my clients are blue screen.\n\n1065\n00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:46,210\nSo while you can automate that stuff,\n\n1066\n00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:48,150\nwe typically don't do that in\nthe corporate environment.\n\n1067\n00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:51,030\nWe wanna be able to test the updates\nin a controlled environment\n\n1068\n00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:53,190\nbefore we push them out to\nour production environment.\n\n1069\n00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:54,950\nSo just something.\n\n1070\n00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,190\nAgain we'll talk about that\nmore in our server classes.\n\n1071\n00:57:57,190 --> 00:58:03,140\nSo it can be done, probably shouldn't be\ndone in most environments in my opinion.\n\n1072\n00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,655\n>> And always test your updates too\nto make sure they're patching what\n\n1073\n00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:07,065\nthey're supposed to.\n\n1074\n00:58:07,065 --> 00:58:10,795\nYou don't want to be roadkill,\nright, if that happens.\n\n1075\n00:58:10,795 --> 00:58:12,695\nYou know Microsoft,\nthey like to update their updates.\n\n1076\n00:58:12,695 --> 00:58:16,325\nCause they issue an update and\nsometimes that causes a new vulnerability.\n\n1077\n00:58:16,325 --> 00:58:17,075\nI kid, Microsoft.\n\n1078\n00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:21,210\nI mean, sometimes that happens, but\nthey're pretty good about testing them.\n\n1079\n00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:25,420\nBut they can't test every possible\ncombination of hardware and software, and\n\n1080\n00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,470\nOS and things like that.\n\n1081\n00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,800\nSo your situation might\nbe slightly different.\n\n1082\n00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,180\nAnd that update might cause a problem.\n\n1083\n00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:33,785\nSo the best thing to do is test\nthem in an isolated environment\n\n1084\n00:58:33,785 --> 00:58:36,215\nusing something like deployment services.\n\n1085\n00:58:36,215 --> 00:58:40,835\nI said deployment services earlier,\nI meant Windows update server services.\n\n1086\n00:58:40,835 --> 00:58:41,817\n>> I know what you meant, Bob.\n\n1087\n00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:43,195\n[LAUGH] I had your back.\n\n1088\n00:58:43,195 --> 00:58:43,710\n>> Yeah, sorry.\n\n1089\n00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,625\nPhillip's gotta be out there too,\nand Matthew.\n\n1090\n00:58:45,625 --> 00:58:46,590\nYeah, thanks everybody.\n\n1091\n00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:50,403\nAnd just like blah blah blah, but yeah,\nWindows Server Update Services [LAUGH]\n\n1092\n00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:52,601\n>> You were those students in class,\n\n1093\n00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:53,496\nweren't you?\n\n1094\n00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:54,392\nyou know who you are.\n\n1095\n00:58:54,392 --> 00:58:55,287\n>> [LAUGH] So\n\n1096\n00:58:55,287 --> 00:59:00,100\ndefinitely want to make sure we're\ntesting those before we push those out.\n\n1097\n00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,970\nI mean, you don't want to crash your\nweb server because some update came\n\n1098\n00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:04,070\nout the night before.\n\n1099\n00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:04,778\nIt was funny.\n\n1100\n00:59:04,778 --> 00:59:10,540\nI had a colleague I talked\nto at one point that\n\n1101\n00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:15,990\nhad one of those really bad situations\nthat we all have early on in our careers.\n\n1102\n00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:21,890\nHe was doing one where someone asked him\ndid he know how to apply a Exchange 2000.\n\n1103\n00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,180\nDo you know Exchange 2000,\n\n1104\n00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,450\ndo you know how to apply patches,\nand did he know clustering?\n\n1105\n00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,875\nHe was like, yeah.\n\n1106\n00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,640\nAnd he'd just been through school.\n\n1107\n00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,749\nI know how to do that.\n\n1108\n00:59:31,749 --> 00:59:32,408\n>> He's confident anyway.\n\n1109\n00:59:32,408 --> 00:59:34,260\n>> Yeah.\nHe was just like, yeah, I've studied this,\n\n1110\n00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:35,140\nI know how to do it.\n\n1111\n00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,470\nThey were like, okay.\n\n1112\n00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:39,890\nYou have the permissions do this or\nprivileges to do this.\n\n1113\n00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,660\nGo over and patch these exchange\nservers on these clusters.\n\n1114\n00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,370\nHe wanted to impress, so he did his.\n\n1115\n00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,042\nHe, he wanted to get this done\nreally quickly and efficiently.\n\n1116\n00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:51,390\nSo what he did is he Xeroxed\nthat stuff onto a bunch\n\n1117\n00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,208\nof CDs\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1118\n00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:54,000\n>> And\npopped into one cluster to get it started,\n\n1119\n00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,120\nthen tabbed over the other one\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1120\n00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:56,470\n>> And got it started over there.\n\n1121\n00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:59,130\nAfter you get it going, goes and\ngoes all the way to the line.\n\n1122\n00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:03,833\nBy the time it got to the last cluster it\ncame back around fail, fail, fail [LAUGH].\n\n1123\n01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:08,675\nHe was just like running man just last,\nlast one no, and it just failed.\n\n1124\n01:00:08,675 --> 01:00:10,836\nIt was so bad, the failure was so\n\n1125\n01:00:10,836 --> 01:00:15,890\nbad that the consultants that they\ntried to fix it, they couldn't fix it.\n\n1126\n01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,200\nThe consultants there go we\ndon't know what you did, and\n\n1127\n01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:24,030\nsince the company was a large, large\ncompany, they had Microsoft actually sent\n\n1128\n01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,365\ntheir engineers down from Redmond to come\ntake a look at it going, what's going on?\n\n1129\n01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:29,445\nThe engineers are like we\ndon't know what's going on.\n\n1130\n01:00:29,445 --> 01:00:30,815\nWe don't know what you did.\n\n1131\n01:00:30,815 --> 01:00:32,095\nIt got that bad.\n\n1132\n01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:39,300\nThey lost, you know, all their e-mail\nservices for like four or five days.\n\n1133\n01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,930\nI mean it was trashed because they had\nto rebuild everything from scratch.\n\n1134\n01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:43,590\n>> Holy cow.\n\n1135\n01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:46,180\n>> Yeah cause they couldn't\nfigure out what was going on.\n\n1136\n01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,330\n>> Test your updates\nbefore you apply them,\n\n1137\n01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:51,500\nand then make sure you know the proper\nway to apply them to a cluster.\n\n1138\n01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,066\n>> Yeah, test these things,\ntest these things, test these things.\n\n1139\n01:00:56,066 --> 01:00:58,700\nDon't up this guy.\n\n1140\n01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:01,630\nI mentioned his story,\nyou don't know who it is or anything, but\n\n1141\n01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:06,530\nit wasn't me [LAUGH] but\nthe guy that told me\n\n1142\n01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:11,510\nsaid it in front of a class\nbecause he was trying to\n\n1143\n01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:15,770\nget the point across in saying this\nwas stupid that I did this this way.\n\n1144\n01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,020\nHe goes, I didn't think things through.\n\n1145\n01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,380\nHe says I was too focused on trying to get\nit done quickly and not the right way.\n\n1146\n01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:25,060\nAnd I didn't have any room for\nerror in there and I made a mistake.\n\n1147\n01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:28,680\nSo, That's why I point\nit out as an example.\n\n1148\n01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:32,980\nAs someone mentioned here,\nhave a back ou plan.\n\n1149\n01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:34,340\nHave a rollback plan.\n\n1150\n01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,180\nAs Murphy's law anything that\ncan go wrong, will go wrong.\n\n1151\n01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,580\nDon't be one of those people.\n\n1152\n01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,680\nIf you plan ahead something's gonna go\nwrong, you know it's gonna go wrong.\n\n1153\n01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,170\nDoesn't have to be catastrophic.\n\n1154\n01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,020\n>> Exactly.\n\n1155\n01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,260\nGood planning is paramount.\n\n1156\n01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:53,240\nAlright.\nSo some other common web server flaws\n\n1157\n01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:53,980\nwe should talk about.\n\n1158\n01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:56,520\nI guess mention just some terminology.\n\n1159\n01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,480\nOne, DOS comes back into mind.\n\n1160\n01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,030\n>> Oh yeah.\nYeah.\n\n1161\n01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:02,180\n>> You know a web server is definitely\nvulnerable to something like that.\n\n1162\n01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:08,430\nYeah, there's DDOSs, DOSs,\nDDOSs that we have to think about.\n\n1163\n01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:09,730\nThere's also, you know, having,\n\n1164\n01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:14,180\nmake sure you have proper\nprotection around the web server.\n\n1165\n01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:18,680\nStuff like firewalls, maybe place\nit in the DMZ, which is a big one.\n\n1166\n01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,669\nIDSs of both the host base and network\nbased, which we're gonna talk about.\n\n1167\n01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:28,030\nHaving antivirus stuff\nin place is a big one,\n\n1168\n01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,870\nthere are just plenty of things there.\n\n1169\n01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:34,670\nEven going through and seeing if you\ncan switch the default accounts, and\n\n1170\n01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,302\nthen there's even to something else,\n\n1171\n01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:38,370\nto make sure you use good passwords\n>> right\n\n1172\n01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:38,980\n>> on things.\n\n1173\n01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:42,020\nAnd even on top of that If\nyou're a Windows network,\n\n1174\n01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:44,950\nthere should be no reason, even though\nyou still see it, and I cringe.\n\n1175\n01:02:44,950 --> 01:02:48,250\nI know you've seen it too, probably, but I\nstill cringe at people that put their web\n\n1176\n01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:51,000\nserver in the DMZ and\nattach it to their domain.\n\n1177\n01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,150\nIt's like, did you just do that?\n\n1178\n01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:56,930\nThere's a reason we put those\nout there in the DMZ right?\n\n1179\n01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,456\n>> Yeah [CROSSTALK] Take several\nshots of tequila or something,\n\n1180\n01:03:00,456 --> 01:03:04,130\nwhatever to get the pain of what's\ngonna happen out of my head.\n\n1181\n01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:07,476\nSo you see these little things,\nthere's little mistakes that people make,\n\n1182\n01:03:07,476 --> 01:03:09,410\ndon't make those little mistakes.\n\n1183\n01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:12,810\nYou know a lot of the things to protect\na web server and those vulnerabilities\n\n1184\n01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:18,060\nare just gaps in people's common sense,\nyou know, not patching?\n\n1185\n01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:23,480\nThat's common sense, if you're not\ndoing it, what else do we need to say?\n\n1186\n01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:26,870\n>> It boggles my mind sometimes when\nI have to tell people there's a known\n\n1187\n01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:27,570\nvulnerability.\n\n1188\n01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,920\nEverybody knows about that,\nincluding the bad guys.\n\n1189\n01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:33,870\nThere is a patch for it, there is a fix to\nprevent this vulnerability from being able\n\n1190\n01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:37,220\nto, or to prevent people from taking\nadvantage of that vulnerability.\n\n1191\n01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:40,510\nIt's there,\nwhy aren't you implementing it?\n\n1192\n01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:42,656\nYou know?\nUnless you've got a really good reason,\n\n1193\n01:03:42,656 --> 01:03:46,211\nyou've tested it and it doesn't work with\nyour particular combination of hardware or\n\n1194\n01:03:46,211 --> 01:03:49,181\nsoftware or something like that That's\nlike going without a vaccine for\n\n1195\n01:03:49,181 --> 01:03:51,681\na disease that's been running around,\nit's like why not?\n\n1196\n01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:54,425\nSo patch, patch, patch, and\nwe talked about security,\n\n1197\n01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:56,610\nthat's one of the basic\nthings we talk about.\n\n1198\n01:03:56,610 --> 01:04:01,155\nHardening a server means,\nremoving my default configurations, and\n\n1199\n01:04:01,155 --> 01:04:05,495\napplying all security and\ncritical related updates and patches.\n\n1200\n01:04:05,495 --> 01:04:08,835\nTo both the server the OS as well as\nthe applications that are running on it,\n\n1201\n01:04:08,835 --> 01:04:10,685\ncause we gotta patch those as well.\n\n1202\n01:04:10,685 --> 01:04:12,675\nISS you know,\nhas its own set of patches that come out.\n\n1203\n01:04:12,675 --> 01:04:14,260\nSo we've gotta stay on top of it.\n\n1204\n01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:17,050\nAnd make sure we're keeping\nthose guys up to date.\n\n1205\n01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:20,290\n>> Yeah, there's not much more\nyou can say about there, people.\n\n1206\n01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,140\nThat's really it.\n\n1207\n01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:24,660\nKeeping things up to date and\ndoing these common sense steps.\n\n1208\n01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,320\nI mean,\nthere's a lot of things you can do.\n\n1209\n01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,540\nThese are just the basics.\n\n1210\n01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:30,280\nI mean,\nyou can even add in other stuff in there.\n\n1211\n01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,310\nThat's a flaw.\n\n1212\n01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:32,910\nOne of the ones we talked\nabout is log files.\n\n1213\n01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:36,230\nThey saw that pop up in the group,\nlog files.\n\n1214\n01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:38,300\nLog files, if you're going\nto be really smart about it,\n\n1215\n01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,540\nyou would redirect the log files to\na system that's secure off the web server.\n\n1216\n01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:44,190\nThat way if the web server is compromised,\n\n1217\n01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:48,580\nsomeone can't monkey with your log\nfiles and say hey, nothing's happened.\n\n1218\n01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:53,150\nWell, you took out that system, you didn't\nhave log files for being kept in a secure,\n\n1219\n01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:54,900\nlocation out here.\n\n1220\n01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:00,630\nSo there's a lot of good stuff you can do,\nto make a web server safe.\n\n1221\n01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,010\nThat's about as specific as\nwe can get about it though,\n\n1222\n01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:06,920\nbecause then you gotta start getting\ninto here's IES, and here's Apache, and\n\n1223\n01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:10,670\nhere's engine X, and here's whatever AO.\n\n1224\n01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,270\nThose allow their specifics steps.\n\n1225\n01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:14,560\n>> All right.\nWell, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1226\n01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:16,900\nlooking at our clocks,\nit's about time for us to take our break.\n\n1227\n01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:19,630\nSo we're going to step away for\na moment and when we come back,\n\n1228\n01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:22,685\nwe're going to continue on with our\nweb servers and web applications.\n\n1229\n01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:25,755\nAnd we're gonna dive into the web\napplication side of things.\n\n1230\n01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:26,985\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1231\n01:05:26,985 --> 01:05:28,090\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1232\n01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,575\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go set up the board and\n\n1233\n01:05:30,575 --> 01:05:31,293\nthe pool of

applications, Nick.\n\n1239\n01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,630\nSo, where do we start\nwith the applications?\n\n1240\n01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:54,670\nWell when we talk about web applications,\nwe've already kind of discussed what\n\n1241\n01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:58,670\nthey are, now it's time to discuss\nhow they can be broken, and\n\n1242\n01:05:58,670 --> 01:06:01,570\nreally taken advantage of those systems.\n\n1243\n01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:05,940\nAnd really the biggest one\nthat we got to worry about,\n\n1244\n01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,680\nand think about,\nis that question of unvalidated input.\n\n1245\n01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,466\n>> Crazy right?\n\n1246\n01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:11,450\n>> Oh yeah, that's, that.\n\n1247\n01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:16,150\nAnd the thing is that you\nhaven't at this point,\n\n1248\n01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,140\nquite yet seen just how nasty it can be.\n\n1249\n01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:23,740\nBut it really is the starting point for\nseveral more advanced attacks,\n\n1250\n01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,330\nthat we haven't even got to yet.\n\n1251\n01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:30,100\nSo understanding what this is is key to\nunderstanding how those other attacks\n\n1252\n01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:30,680\nwork.\n\n1253\n01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,470\nAnd how you can go through\nthe whole process.\n\n1254\n01:06:33,470 --> 01:06:36,320\nSo what is unvalidated input?\n\n1255\n01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,420\nWell the name says it all really.\n\n1256\n01:06:38,420 --> 01:06:39,140\n>> Invalid input.\n\n1257\n01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,210\n>> It hasn't been validated.\n\n1258\n01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:42,752\n>> Exactly, done.\n\n1259\n01:06:42,752 --> 01:06:43,993\nAll right next one.\n\n1260\n01:06:43,993 --> 01:06:47,399\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]

But,\n\n1263\n01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:55,970\nwhat we have,\nwe talk about invalidated input.\n\n1264\n01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:00,560\nIt really is,\nit sounds kinda trite to say it like that.\n\n1265\n01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,840\nBut it really is input that\nhas not been validated.\n\n1266\n01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:09,260\nWell, what would that really happen\nif someone, let's say, had a form and\n\n1267\n01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:15,370\ntyped some stuff in, and it didn't go into\nthe database, or whatever the right way?\n\n1268\n01:07:15,370 --> 01:07:18,410\nWell, seems like you just get junk data,\nright?\n\n1269\n01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,750\nOr something that's\njust not going to work.\n\n1270\n01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:24,500\nWell, that's true, but\nit's not the whole picture.\n\n1271\n01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:29,810\nIf you type something into a form and\nit's not correct,\n\n1272\n01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:33,740\nthere's numerous things that can happen\nin addition to getting junk data.\n\n1273\n01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:38,870\nIt could be that you crash something,\nthat has very much happened.\n\n1274\n01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:43,445\nIt could be that you,\nthat you open up holes on the system.\n\n1275\n01:07:43,445 --> 01:07:46,935\nOr it could even be in the case of one\nof our later attack sequel injections,\n\n1276\n01:07:46,935 --> 01:07:50,545\nthat you can actually put queries in\nthere and the system, since it doesn't\n\n1277\n01:07:50,545 --> 01:07:55,142\ndo anything to sanitize that data,\nand make sure it's the correct format.\n\n1278\n01:07:55,142 --> 01:07:58,212\nShoots into the database and all of a\nsudden the database does something wacko.\n\n1279\n01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:00,142\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n1280\n01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,812\na lot of nastiness can\nhappen as a result of this.\n\n1281\n01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,422\nAnd that's really true with any\napplication too, by the way.\n\n1282\n01:08:05,422 --> 01:08:08,422\nAnytime you get input from somebody,\nor something.\n\n1283\n01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:11,352\nIf you're getting it and\nyou don't validate what it is,\n\n1284\n01:08:11,352 --> 01:08:14,192\nthen you could be potentially\nopening a huge door, or\n\n1285\n01:08:14,192 --> 01:08:16,970\nyou are opening a huge door\nto problems down the line.\n\n1286\n01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:19,010\nIt's just a question\nof someone finding it.\n\n1287\n01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,880\n>> Yeah, let's keep it really simple.\n\n1288\n01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:23,920\nWhat if you've got an application\nyou're hosting on a website, and it's\n\n1289\n01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,300\nsupposed to calculate an interest rate on\na loan amount, or something like that.\n\n1290\n01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,560\nWhere you're supposed to\ntype in your loan amount,\n\n1291\n01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:32,330\npick your interest rate from a drop\ndown list and have it calculate it.\n\n1292\n01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:34,970\nWell what if you type in your\nname instead of a loan amount.\n\n1293\n01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:37,980\nYou know, that information's getting\nsent back to be processed by ASP or\n\n1294\n01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:39,550\nwhatever it is you're using.\n\n1295\n01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:44,100\nAnd when it tries to multiply, it can't\nmultiply a number by a name, obviously, so\n\n1296\n01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,210\nit throws an error.\n\n1297\n01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:48,580\nNow it's up to, how do they handle that\nerror within that application, you know,\n\n1298\n01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:52,670\ndoes it crash the application, does it\ncrash the entire server, what's it do?\n\n1299\n01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,340\nSo we've really got to make\nsure that we're checking,\n\n1300\n01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:00,450\nany time we give the users or somebody\nelse, so the chance to input data.\n\n1301\n01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:03,460\nWe want to make sure we're checking\nwhat the heck they're putting in there.\n\n1302\n01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,650\n>> Yeah,\nI mean when they have an application.\n\n1303\n01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:08,860\nIf it's something that you've developed,\nor something that you got from someplace\n\n1304\n01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:13,645\nelse, the application should know what\ntype of information it's expecting.\n\n1305\n01:09:13,645 --> 01:09:15,455\nSo therefore you should\nbe able to constrain it.\n\n1306\n01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:16,015\n>> Yeah.\n\n1307\n01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:17,675\n>> That's just the long and short of it.\n\n1308\n01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:20,355\nIf you're expecting an email address,\n\n1309\n01:09:20,355 --> 01:09:22,195\nyou know what format\nan email address comes in.\n\n1310\n01:09:22,195 --> 01:09:24,065\nIf it's not in that format, kick it back.\n\n1311\n01:09:24,065 --> 01:09:27,715\nDon't let it leave that form,\nwhen you hit submit.\n\n1312\n01:09:27,715 --> 01:09:32,890\nLet it stay there, and flag it as saying,\nhey it's bad, and tell the user to fix it.\n\n1313\n01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,790\nIt's the same thing with phone numbers or\nanything else.\n\n1314\n01:09:35,790 --> 01:09:41,590\nNot to mention if someone types\nin a sequel query in a box.\n\n1315\n01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:44,330\nThat's totally off the mark.\n\n1316\n01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:46,500\nThat should not occur at all.\n\n1317\n01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:49,750\nSo there should be validation saying\nif it's not in the correct format.\n\n1318\n01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:51,620\nOr hack, there could be situations.\n\n1319\n01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,150\nYou could very easily make\na case if you think about it,\n\n1320\n01:09:54,150 --> 01:09:58,680\non why someone would be\npasting SQL code into a form.\n\n1321\n01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:04,020\nIt could be I could be someone having\nan issue with a product that's SQL based.\n\n1322\n01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,730\nThen you know,\nMike over here's the expert.\n\n1323\n01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:07,360\nHe's gotta see my code.\n\n1324\n01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:15,010\nFine, I paste it to a comment field, and\nI submit it over, Mike takes a look at it,\n\n1325\n01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:20,325\nbut by the same token,\nthat Code shouldn't be executed.\n\n1326\n01:10:20,325 --> 01:10:24,205\nIt's just treated as data at that point,\nit's not executable code.\n\n1327\n01:10:24,205 --> 01:10:26,645\nTherefore, the problem goes away.\n\n1328\n01:10:26,645 --> 01:10:30,245\nIt's supposed to be a catastrophic\nthing if you leave unvalidated input,\n\n1329\n01:10:30,245 --> 01:10:33,217\ncan really truly be Catastrophic.\n\n1330\n01:10:33,217 --> 01:10:35,457\n>> Yeah and really it can be done\nin a couple of places, right?\n\n1331\n01:10:35,457 --> 01:10:37,827\nAt the web server itself, that web page.\n\n1332\n01:10:37,827 --> 01:10:39,287\nLike if we're using, I don't know,\n\n1333\n01:10:39,287 --> 01:10:42,537\nJavaScript or something like that,\nwe can check it right then and there.\n\n1334\n01:10:42,537 --> 01:10:45,810\nYou guys have been to web pages where you\ntype in a name, and you throw it a number,\n\n1335\n01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:47,170\nand it tells you it's\nan invalid character.\n\n1336\n01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:48,780\nIt throws up that red asterisk.\n\n1337\n01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,390\nI mean it should be checked there, and\n\n1338\n01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:53,930\nthen it should also be checked before\nit's processed by your backend as well.\n\n1339\n01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:56,820\nTo make sure that that\ndata is still valid.\n\n1340\n01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:00,730\nYou want more than one check on there,\nbecause it's too easy for\n\n1341\n01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:03,270\nthem to insert bad information.\n\n1342\n01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:05,195\nAnd maybe not even intentionally.\n\n1343\n01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:08,520\nCan cause some major problems on\nthe back end or on your webserver or\n\n1344\n01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,250\non that application.\n\n1345\n01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:17,100\nLittle things like, do I really need\n255 characters for a first name field?\n\n1346\n01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,640\nMost first names are not\ngonna be 255 characters, so\n\n1347\n01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:22,280\nwhy allow them to insert 255 characters?\n\n1348\n01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:27,340\nIf I limit that to ten characters, or\n15 characters, or something like that,\n\n1349\n01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:32,270\nI can't very well type out an entire\nsequel command in 15 characters.\n\n1350\n01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,780\nOr anything that I really\nwant to do in 15 characters.\n\n1351\n01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,620\nSo it's easy to do.\n\n1352\n01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,933\nIt's just overlooked.\n\n1353\n01:11:37,933 --> 01:11:40,779\nAnd then a lot of time the problem\nis it's, may be out of my control.\n\n1354\n01:11:40,779 --> 01:11:42,879\nIf I bought the application from somebody,\n\n1355\n01:11:42,879 --> 01:11:45,615\nhow do I know if they're doing\ninput validation on that?\n\n1356\n01:11:45,615 --> 01:11:50,838\nSo it can be a problem that we\ndon't even know we have at first.\n\n1357\n01:11:50,838 --> 01:11:52,240\nTesting is the way to go.\n\n1358\n01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,870\nI think you mentioned the term\nfuzzing the other day.\n\n1359\n01:11:54,870 --> 01:11:55,480\n>> Yes.\n\n1360\n01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:59,210\n>> Throwing data at that input\nfield to see what happens.\n\n1361\n01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:01,100\nHow does your application handle it?\n\n1362\n01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,640\nAnd then writing the proper code\nin the application to handle\n\n1363\n01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,840\nsituations like that.\n\n1364\n01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,669\n>> Yeah, and there's, and you''re right.\n\n1365\n01:12:08,669 --> 01:12:12,926\nWhen you get an application form someone\nelse you should do this testing.\n\n1366\n01:12:12,926 --> 01:12:16,200\nIf you're really aboveboard you\nshould look at different things,\n\n1367\n01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,890\ndo feature testing, see if they're\nworking as designed; do fuzzing,\n\n1368\n01:12:19,890 --> 01:12:26,130\ntest ranges of just obscure values and\nsee what the application does in response.\n\n1369\n01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:31,410\nI guarantee you that when people use your\napplication they're going to find some way\n\n1370\n01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:35,780\nto enter something the wrong way,\neither through accident, or\n\n1371\n01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:40,160\nbecause they just aren't paying attention,\nor you name it.\n\n1372\n01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:41,380\nIt's happened.\n\n1373\n01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:43,840\nAnd so you have to have input validation.\n\n1374\n01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,540\nIf you don't have input validation and\n\n1375\n01:12:45,540 --> 01:12:48,260\ncheck these things,\nyou're gonna have problems.\n\n1376\n01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:51,860\nYou know I remember one case you\nused to cite from years ago.\n\n1377\n01:12:51,860 --> 01:12:53,220\nYou probably heard of it.\n\n1378\n01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,880\nIt's been around for a while.\n\n1379\n01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,350\nIt's one they had in the air\ntraffic control system in LA,\n\n1380\n01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,770\nthey put a,\nthey had done a software update to it and\n\n1381\n01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:09,800\nthe software update to the system was\na system for filing flight plans and\n\n1382\n01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,440\nsomeone put in apparently nine digits into\n\n1383\n01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,670\na field on a form when it was expecting\nfive and there was no check for it.\n\n1384\n01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:24,410\nSo they put this nine digits in and\nhit submit and\n\n1385\n01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:28,240\nit would essentially hit submit it goes\ninto the data, went into the system.\n\n1386\n01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:29,880\nThe system didn't know how to handle it.\n\n1387\n01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,160\nNow what the system did is it crashed.\n\n1388\n01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,250\nThe whole system crashed.\n\n1389\n01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:36,880\nAnd because of what it was tied into,\n\n1390\n01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,290\nthey actually had to go back to the old\nway of doing the stuff, the backup system\n\n1391\n01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:46,290\nthat they used which essentially\nthe stuff that was used in the 70s,\n\n1392\n01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:51,625\nso it caused massive delays of stalled\nair traffic all the way across the US.\n\n1393\n01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:56,576\nAnd even some of these international\nthings, they had to slow it down,\n\n1394\n01:13:56,576 --> 01:14:00,880\nit caused massive delays because\nof that one little mistake.\n\n1395\n01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:06,080\nBut no one was injured,\nno one was killed or anything like that.\n\n1396\n01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,540\nBut it did cause a [CROSSTALK]\n>> Could have been,\n\n1397\n01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:09,380\nthe potential was there.\n\n1398\n01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:13,230\n>> Yeah, the potential was there.\n\n1399\n01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:17,470\nAnd a couple other variables in there,\nor another bad run or whatever,\n\n1400\n01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:18,820\nyou could of had that problem.\n\n1401\n01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:20,310\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1402\n01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:22,300\nAnd we had a good question\nin the chat room.\n\n1403\n01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,020\nBrian asked,\nif JavaScript runs on the client,\n\n1404\n01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:28,380\nthen perhaps the attacker can\nstill inject malformed input?\n\n1405\n01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,250\nAnd that's why I say we typically do\ninput validation at more than one place.\n\n1406\n01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:36,410\nWe'll check it on the Web server,\nthat that form that they're filling out\n\n1407\n01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:40,590\nbefore they clicked Submit, we were\ntypically checking it real-time in there.\n\n1408\n01:14:40,590 --> 01:14:41,510\nThey click Submit.\n\n1409\n01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,230\nWe'll probably check it again\nbefore we send it to our back-end.\n\n1410\n01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:49,050\nAnd then before the back-end processes it,\nwe probably have checked some place there.\n\n1411\n01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:53,040\nThat way it makes it a lot more difficult\nfor them to modify it in transit or\n\n1412\n01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,100\nsomething like that.\n\n1413\n01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:54,980\nBut you're absolutely right.\n\n1414\n01:14:54,980 --> 01:15:00,380\nIf we only check it on the front-end, if\nthey had access to the Web server at this\n\n1415\n01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:06,480\npoint then they could possibly submit, you\nknow, bad input to the back-end as well.\n\n1416\n01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,085\nAnd that's why we just do multiple checks.\n\n1417\n01:15:08,085 --> 01:15:12,740\n>> Yeah, we talked about this\nat the beginning, layers.\n\n1418\n01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:18,320\nThere should never be a situation where\na security mechanism exists in a vacuum.\n\n1419\n01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:19,760\nIt just shouldn't.\n\n1420\n01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,970\nIf it exists in a vacuum,\nthere's nothing else to fall back on.\n\n1421\n01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:25,570\nYou've got a single point of\nfailure that you need to fix.\n\n1422\n01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:28,165\nAnd then just for the benefit of\nyou guys watching the recording,\n\n1423\n01:15:28,165 --> 01:15:30,220\ncuz there's a great one in\nthe chat room right now,\n\n1424\n01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:33,660\nDavid says my college professor\ncalled it his head test.\n\n1425\n01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,670\nOur programs had to stand up\nto him rocking the keyboard\n\n1426\n01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,290\nacross the top of his head.\n\n1427\n01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:43,180\nSo just random input, what the heck\nis this program gonna actually,\n\n1428\n01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,220\nhow's it gonna respond?\n\n1429\n01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:45,040\nWhat's it gonna do?\n\n1430\n01:15:46,090 --> 01:15:50,190\nSo, a very important part, an easy fix for\n\n1431\n01:15:50,190 --> 01:15:52,450\nthe most part but\noverlooked a lot of times.\n\n1432\n01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:55,540\nBecause it means a lot of\nextra lines of code typically\n\n1433\n01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:56,840\nto do that input validation.\n\n1434\n01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:59,370\nAnd lazy programmers\nare gonna skip that part.\n\n1435\n01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:02,450\nYeah, I talked about that application\nI tried to develop at one point,\n\n1436\n01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:03,830\nthere was no error\nchecking in there at all.\n\n1437\n01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,700\nI was just happy the dern thing worked.\n\n1438\n01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:08,190\nBut again,\nI'm not selling it to a business for\n\n1439\n01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:11,050\nthem to implement in\na production environment either.\n\n1440\n01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:15,610\nSo something that we have to pay attention\nto, and then another thing that can\n\n1441\n01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:17,590\nhappen, I think we've got it\non our list of objectives,\n\n1442\n01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:21,150\nI just don't see it is, you know,\nwhat happens if you do submit that?\n\n1443\n01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:26,380\nThe errors that start popping up, what\nkind of information can I gain from that?\n\n1444\n01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,240\n>> Yeah, that's another good point.\n\n1445\n01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:34,570\nYou see it here, and you see it even more\nin sequel injections is when you submit\n\n1446\n01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:39,880\nsomething to an application\nmaybe the data's not right and\n\n1447\n01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,680\nit spits back an error at you.\n\n1448\n01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,750\nBut what does that error say?\n\n1449\n01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:46,160\nThat error could have connection\ninformation about the database.\n\n1450\n01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:48,880\nIt could say where in the code it failed.\n\n1451\n01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:49,420\nI mean, you name it.\n\n1452\n01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:52,410\nThere could be a lot of things\nthat it actually kicks back.\n\n1453\n01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:53,500\n>> We've probably all seen it.\n\n1454\n01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:57,010\nWhere you go to some sites and\nmaybe something happens, it glitches.\n\n1455\n01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,270\nAnd you get this nice, friendly,\npretty picture of a construction site, or\n\n1456\n01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:04,020\nsomething crazy like that, like oops,\nsorry, we can't process your data.\n\n1457\n01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,930\nOther times though you've been to\na site where something's gone wrong and\n\n1458\n01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,810\nyou get this big old long,\nnasty error that shows up.\n\n1459\n01:17:11,810 --> 01:17:14,240\nNow a lot of the time, as you said,\nthat has a lot of good information for\n\n1460\n01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:14,760\nthe bad guys.\n\n1461\n01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,490\nSo we want to make sure we're\nwriting custom error messages.\n\n1462\n01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:22,040\nNot only are we validating that input,\nwe're making sure that if something\n\n1463\n01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:26,440\ndoes happen, we're controlling what\nis returned back to that application.\n\n1464\n01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:32,540\nAll right, validating input or\nunvalidated input is a bad thing.\n\n1465\n01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:34,700\nWe wanna do our input validation.\n\n1466\n01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:37,970\nOther Web application\nvulnerabilities we might face.\n\n1467\n01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:40,790\nDirectory traversal, which I think\nsomebody mentioned in the chat room,\n\n1468\n01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:42,240\nis another very common one.\n\n1469\n01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,540\n>> Yeah, I saw that one scroll by,\ndirectory traversal.\n\n1470\n01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:47,380\nIt's an interesting one,\n\n1471\n01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:52,480\na very neat neat one to see in action,\nif you can get it to work nowadays.\n\n1472\n01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,750\nIt's becoming tougher and tougher to do.\n\n1473\n01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:58,540\nIf you go back in time, you know,\nand find older Web servers and\n\n1474\n01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:01,370\nolder situations maybe\nyou'll get it to work.\n\n1475\n01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:05,510\nWhat it is, is Essence taking the URL and\nthen tacking on some characters at the end\n\n1476\n01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:09,160\nof it and then tacking on a path\nto some place on the hard drive.\n\n1477\n01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:13,460\nAnd which means that you're gonna try\nto break out of the Web server and\n\n1478\n01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,860\ngo onto a location on the drive.\n\n1479\n01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:20,720\nSo you might put www blabadeeblah and\nthen do dot dot dot\n\n1480\n01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:24,870\nslash dot dot dot slash and then put\nthe path to the Windows folder and\n\n1481\n01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:29,740\nthat will tell the system,\nhey jump out of the Web server folder and\n\n1482\n01:18:29,740 --> 01:18:34,940\ngo to the root of the drive and then\ngo to the Windows system 32 folder, and\n\n1483\n01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:38,320\nyou might open a command prompt at that\npoint, you might do something else.\n\n1484\n01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,210\n>> Yeah, I mean,\nyou guys can test this on your own.\n\n1485\n01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:45,580\nOpen up a browser, go to a website and\ntake the last directory off of\n\n1486\n01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,910\nthe URL that's in there,\nhit Enter and see what happens.\n\n1487\n01:18:47,910 --> 01:18:52,000\nYou won't believe how many sites you\nactually get like a directory list,\n\n1488\n01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,156\nyou know of all the resources\nthat are in that folder.\n\n1489\n01:18:54,156 --> 01:18:58,690\nIt shocks me sometimes.\n\n1490\n01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:02,470\n>> Yeah, it's that is a common thing\nyou should never, I mean that's\n\n1491\n01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:07,720\neven another issue including this and\nbesides this is directory browsing.\n\n1492\n01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:08,910\nDirectory browsing.\n\n1493\n01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:15,080\nIf someone can, you can click on a link or\ntype in a URL and you get a list of,\n\n1494\n01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,840\nyou don't get the website,\nyou get a list of stuff in that folder.\n\n1495\n01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,420\nThat's bad.\n\n1496\n01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:21,190\nAnd that, you're right.\n\n1497\n01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,710\nThat is a very common thing to see.\n\n1498\n01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:24,840\nYou can actually do Google searches for\nthat.\n\n1499\n01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,739\nGoogle, do Google hacks.\n\n1500\n01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:30,600\nAnd find those and\nfind things that are vulnerable to that.\n\n1501\n01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:33,690\nAnd if I can start working my way back\nup that directory as Sean's saying,\n\n1502\n01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,700\nwe know the default location for\nWindows for example.\n\n1503\n01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,393\nSQL and INEPT hub, www root.\n\n1504\n01:19:39,393 --> 01:19:40,964\nAnd most people have the defaults, and\n\n1505\n01:19:40,964 --> 01:19:43,112\nin there there's probably\na folder called scripts.\n\n1506\n01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,326\nAnd we've reduced the security\non that folder so\n\n1507\n01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:47,441\nthat scripts are allowed\nto execute In there.\n\n1508\n01:19:47,441 --> 01:19:51,786\nSo if I can back up as you said,\ndo that backslash and start backing up\n\n1509\n01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:56,667\nthe directory and then working my way\nback down into that scripts folder, or\n\n1510\n01:19:56,667 --> 01:20:01,471\neven worse as you say, back up all the way\nto C: and then back down into SQL in\n\n1511\n01:20:01,471 --> 01:20:05,960\nWindows System32,\nwe all know CMDs hiding in there, right?\n\n1512\n01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:08,120\nAnd so that's what they're trying to do,\n\n1513\n01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:09,890\nthey're trying to work their\nway up that directory, and\n\n1514\n01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:13,790\nthen back down into another directory\nthat they shouldn't be allowed to get to.\n\n1515\n01:20:13,790 --> 01:20:16,570\nMaybe different permissions,\nor just good information,\n\n1516\n01:20:16,570 --> 01:20:18,350\nor resources that are in there.\n\n1517\n01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,770\nAll kinds of bad things can happen.\n\n1518\n01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,580\n>> Yeah there can be a lot of little\nnuggets of information hiding in there,\n\n1519\n01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,390\nit's just a question of finding them.\n\n1520\n01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:28,400\nAnd I'll tell you, like you said, when you\ngo back in time to some of these older web\n\n1521\n01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:33,240\nservers that people might still have\nrunning, you might very well find\n\n1522\n01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:38,130\na system that is vulnerable to this,\nand be able to punch right through.\n\n1523\n01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:44,570\nSome of the stuff that actually allows\ndirectory traversals, were actually\n\n1524\n01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:50,470\nthings that people used to make legitimate\napplications run in iOS 5 and 6.\n\n1525\n01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:54,190\nYou know people have gotten use to coding\nit and they found this little shortcut for\n\n1526\n01:20:54,190 --> 01:20:59,350\ndoing things not realizing that\nshortcuts typically in a lot of cases,\n\n1527\n01:20:59,350 --> 01:21:00,840\nI should say, don't come for free.\n\n1528\n01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,450\nYou've got to pay for it somehow.\n\n1529\n01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:08,250\nIn this case was they opened up\na some sort of directory traversal.\n\n1530\n01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,910\nYou might still find it.\n\n1531\n01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,400\nI mean they're still out there,\n\n1532\n01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:15,030\nthey're definitely still out there just\nnot in the numbers that they used to be.\n\n1533\n01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:17,790\n>> Yeah and we started moving things\nto other drives and things like that.\n\n1534\n01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:21,921\nIt becomes a lot more difficult to,\nin fact I'm not even sure if you can jump\n\n1535\n01:21:21,921 --> 01:21:25,151\ndirectory drive letters using\ndirectory traversal but-\n\n1536\n01:21:25,151 --> 01:21:26,310\n>> Yeah different ways.\n\n1537\n01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:30,340\n>> There's some prerequisites you've\ngotta meet before you could do it.\n\n1538\n01:21:30,340 --> 01:21:33,570\nOther vulnerabilities that we've gotta\nface on our web applications are attack\n\n1539\n01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:37,835\nvectors we might use\nagainst a web application.\n\n1540\n01:21:37,835 --> 01:21:40,945\nMight be misconfiguration which I think\nwe've talked about just about everything.\n\n1541\n01:21:40,945 --> 01:21:43,275\n>> Yeah,\nthere's not really much you can say.\n\n1542\n01:21:43,275 --> 01:21:48,455\nAnything now would be beating a dead\nhorse because it's the same thing.\n\n1543\n01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:51,605\nThere's not much we can add to it.\n\n1544\n01:21:51,605 --> 01:21:55,325\nI can say that web applications tend to be\na little more prone to it than just a web\n\n1545\n01:21:55,325 --> 01:21:59,800\nserver is because web applications\nare usually magnitudes more\n\n1546\n01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:02,710\ncomplex than your average\nweb server is gonna be.\n\n1547\n01:22:02,710 --> 01:22:03,750\n>> Right.\n\n1548\n01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:07,370\nAnd just the simple fact that if I've got\nan application inside my network where\n\n1549\n01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:11,430\nmy users are using it, I think most of\nthe time they're not trying to break it.\n\n1550\n01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:13,830\nThey're trying to do their job,\nget paid, and go home.\n\n1551\n01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:17,254\nOf course that application on our web\nserver is getting hit by people that want\n\n1552\n01:22:17,254 --> 01:22:17,840\nto break it.\n\n1553\n01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,890\nSo, they're going to try things that\nthe application wasn't meant to do or\n\n1554\n01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:24,160\ntry to take advantage of\nsome misconfigurations.\n\n1555\n01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,650\nSo, if it's not configured properly,\n\n1556\n01:22:26,650 --> 01:22:29,850\nwe can open up ourselves to\na lot of vulnerabilities.\n\n1557\n01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:31,200\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n1558\n01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,260\n>> And then of course we mentioned session\nhijacking as well as password cracking it.\n\n1559\n01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,100\nAnd we talked about web servers.\n\n1560\n01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:41,830\nThen we talked about hacking in general\nas part of our gaining access phase and\n\n1561\n01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:42,960\nmaintaining access.\n\n1562\n01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,230\nApplications are gonna be\nvulnerable to that as well.\n\n1563\n01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:49,710\n>> Yes, they most definitely are and\n\n1564\n01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:53,730\nsomething you can add in when you talk\nabout passwords and password cracking.\n\n1565\n01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:58,600\nIn fact, folks in the passwords part of\nit go to the Google hacking database.\n\n1566\n01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:01,890\nThe Google hacking database,\nit's got Google hacks in there.\n\n1567\n01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:03,020\nIt specifically look for\n\n1568\n01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:08,270\nthe password files that are stored\non web servers and web applications.\n\n1569\n01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:12,960\nIf you don't have one that does what you\nwant, you can find exactly what you want,\n\n1570\n01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,190\nfind one that gets close to it,\nand tweak it.\n\n1571\n01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:20,474\nBecause someone has already\ndone this sort of thing.\n\n1572\n01:23:20,474 --> 01:23:23,380\n>> Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1573\n01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:26,320\nSo, a lot of this is very similar to\nwhat we talked about with the web\n\n1574\n01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,675\nserver itself.\n\n1575\n01:23:27,675 --> 01:23:31,290\nBecause now we're focusing in on that,\nat that application later,\n\n1576\n01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:34,020\non that application that's\nrunning on that web server.\n\n1577\n01:23:35,190 --> 01:23:39,080\nSo in the end, so protecting\nourselves from some of this stuff.\n\n1578\n01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,610\nIt comes down to configuring the server\nproperly, configuring the application\n\n1579\n01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:50,050\nproperly and doing things like that\nare gonna prevent a lot of this, right?\n\n1580\n01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:54,870\n>> Yeah, you have to know the application\nthat you’re working with and\n\n1581\n01:23:54,870 --> 01:24:00,560\nthat includes not just the web server but\nalso the application on top of it.\n\n1582\n01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,820\nJust cuz an application manages the web\nserver doesn't mean that you're completely\n\n1583\n01:24:04,820 --> 01:24:08,120\nabsolved of any of the responsibility for\nmanaging that web server.\n\n1584\n01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:11,390\nYou need to know the web\napplication as well.\n\n1585\n01:24:11,390 --> 01:24:14,250\nAnd don't underestimate\nany web application.\n\n1586\n01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:16,510\nThey're all very complex nowadays.\n\n1587\n01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,140\nThere's very few that are simple.\n\n1588\n01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:23,280\nI'd even go as far as there's some\napplications that you can get.\n\n1589\n01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:27,180\nI know there's a lot of them exist out\nthere that you can grab some from some\n\n1590\n01:24:27,180 --> 01:24:30,360\nplace and will give it to you for free\nas long as you put a link or something.\n\n1591\n01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,700\nYou can put it up on your site.\n\n1592\n01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:35,990\nThere's no way I'm doing that,\nunless I can vet the code.\n\n1593\n01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:39,200\nNow I'm not a code monkey that can\ncrawl through all that code and\n\n1594\n01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,560\nsee what's going on.\n\n1595\n01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,530\nBut I will get someone if it's\nsomething that is of use to me.\n\n1596\n01:24:43,530 --> 01:24:47,330\nI will get someone to audit that\ncode to see if there's any problems.\n\n1597\n01:24:47,330 --> 01:24:51,450\nYou just have to be smart about\nthese things, but first of all,\n\n1598\n01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:57,090\nknow your equipment, know the stuff\nyou're working with, test it out.\n\n1599\n01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:02,360\nJust do a lot of those things and\nalso understand everything,\n\n1600\n01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:05,405\nweb server can exist on its own but\n\n1601\n01:25:05,405 --> 01:25:10,135\na web application needs a web server to\nrun, so anything that's vulnerable on\n\n1602\n01:25:10,135 --> 01:25:14,405\na web server is gonna automatically\ntranslate over to the web applications.\n\n1603\n01:25:14,405 --> 01:25:17,245\nSo someone might be able to\nattack the web server and\n\n1604\n01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:20,405\nstart getting into your system and\nmonkey with the web application.\n\n1605\n01:25:20,405 --> 01:25:25,335\nAnd then also remember, when we talk about\nweb applications, web applications and\n\n1606\n01:25:25,335 --> 01:25:27,150\nsome of the vulnerabilities there,\n\n1607\n01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:31,220\nallow us to do things in more\nadvanced attacks like SQL injections.\n\n1608\n01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:36,680\nSQL injections are definitely\nmade possible by a lot of\n\n1609\n01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:38,780\nthe stuff we mentioned here.\n\n1610\n01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:42,680\nSo if you're not doing things, like,\nyou're doing invalidated input and\n\n1611\n01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:47,620\nyou have a database back there,\nit's only a matter of time.\n\n1612\n01:25:47,620 --> 01:25:50,720\nTo get C to do SQL injections\nhas gotten to be easier.\n\n1613\n01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,622\nThat's the next step.\n\n1614\n01:25:51,622 --> 01:25:54,810\nIt's gonna be easier because\nthey even have plug ins for\n\n1615\n01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:59,470\nbrowsers that not only analyze the code\nand do stuff for you but they have\n\n1616\n01:25:59,470 --> 01:26:04,150\nones where it will tell you if the site's\nvulnerable to a sequel injection.\n\n1617\n01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,420\nAnd you just type your\nsequel injection code in.\n\n1618\n01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,790\nAnd hit submit.\n\n1619\n01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,630\nAnd it will fire it off to\nsee if it works or not.\n\n1620\n01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:13,220\nSo it's gotten really effective.\n\n1621\n01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:15,760\n>> A little too easy for\nthe bad guys sometimes I think.\n\n1622\n01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:17,140\n>> Yeah.\n>> So.\n\n1623\n01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:17,700\nAll right, Shaun.\n\n1624\n01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:20,710\nWell anything else we want to talk\nabout when it comes to web servers and\n\n1625\n01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:22,430\nweb applications?\n\n1626\n01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:26,430\n>> We've hit the really, really,\nreally important ones that we need to.\n\n1627\n01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:30,630\nKeeping things up to date, having adequate\nprotection around, sanitizing inputs or\n\n1628\n01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:34,670\ndoing input validation,\nchecking auditing code but\n\n1629\n01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:36,840\nthen we had a lot of little\nthings that came before this.\n\n1630\n01:26:36,840 --> 01:26:38,130\nWe had the password cracking.\n\n1631\n01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:40,230\nSession hijacking.\n\n1632\n01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:41,360\nMisconfigurations.\n\n1633\n01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:44,070\nThose are all things that we've\ntalked about in some way, shape, or\n\n1634\n01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:47,910\nform, prior to this chapter.\n\n1635\n01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:50,620\nSo, you're not really seeing\na bunch of new things.\n\n1636\n01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:52,150\nWe're just merging a lot\nof stuff together and\n\n1637\n01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:55,910\nsaying this kind of fits\nin with this category.\n\n1638\n01:26:55,910 --> 01:26:59,510\nJust remember those things and\nremember how they all fit together and\n\n1639\n01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:00,380\nyou should be in good shape.\n\n1640\n01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,450\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1641\n01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:05,500\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen that\nis gonna do for web servers and\n\n1642\n01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,050\nweb applications.\n\n1643\n01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,340\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1644\n01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:10,040\nRemember if your watching\nthe show live and\n\n1645\n01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,900\nyou've got a question, jump into\nour chat room, ask your question.\n\n1646\n01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:17,420\nAs we're doing the show we'll make sure\nwe respond to those questions on air.\n\n1647\n01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:20,640\nIf your watching this as a recording,\nyour not left out in the dark.\n\n1648\n01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:23,040\nAt the top of every page there's a Q and\nA link.\n\n1649\n01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,780\nAll you have to do is click

another episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,037\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Shawn Oreano.\n\n5\n00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:42,319\nHow you doing Shawn?\n\n6\n00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,190\n>> I'm good and I'm ready to go.\n\n7\n00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,590\n>> Ready to go.\n\n8\n00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,750\nI got an exciting episode for\neverybody today.\n\n9\n00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:52,360\nWe are covering the CEH certified ethical\nhackers version eight study guide\n\n10\n00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,952\nwritten by none other\nthan Shawn Oreano and\n\n11\n00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:59,437\ntoday we're gonna be diving into\nchapter 14, which is SQL injection.\n\n12\n00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:03,833\nSo we're gonna take a look at a common,\na very common, very powerful technique.\n\n13\n00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,755\nThis is really the root of a lot of the\ndifferent big attacks that you hear of,\n\n14\n00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:09,612\nI think are based on SQL injection.\n\n15\n00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,396\nIt's, it's, it's extremely powerful and\nsurprisingly enough,\n\n16\n00:01:12,396 --> 00:01:15,764\nthere's a lot of machines out there that\nare still vulnerable to it, isn't there?\n\n17\n00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:17,055\n>> Oh yes.\n\n18\n00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:20,205\nThis is, this is a,\nthis is a biggie right here.\n\n19\n00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,455\nAs far as the, the, you know, the,\n\n20\n00:01:22,455 --> 00:01:25,845\nthe, if you look the top three,\ntypes of attacks that happen,\n\n21\n00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:29,910\nit's usually like in the data,\nit's usually in the top three some place.\n\n22\n00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,390\nAlong with stolen credentials, and,\nyou know, and, and, and something else.\n\n23\n00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,430\nIt's usually right up there, and\n\n24\n00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,420\nthe thing is that it's up there because\nyou can just do so much with it.\n\n25\n00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,254\nThere's, there's a lot,\nthere's a lot of openings there.\n\n26\n00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:45,310\nThere's a tremendous\namount of power behind it.\n\n27\n00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,429\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know, so\n\n28\n00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:50,237\neven though it's not something\nthat the average Joe is able to do\n\n29\n00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:54,595\nat the people that can do it and\ncause a tremendous amount of harm.\n\n30\n00:01:54,595 --> 00:01:58,520\nOh, examples of it we've seen, you know,\nSony got nailed with it, you know,\n\n31\n00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,880\nmultiple times.\n\n32\n00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,610\nThere's been numerous other companies\nthat got nailed with this over the years.\n\n33\n00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,070\nAnd you can do just, just so much.\n\n34\n00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,980\nAll you have to do is just have a good\nknowledge of the SQL language, you know,\n\n35\n00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,200\nwhat makes it tick and then be able\nto have the patience and, and, and\n\n36\n00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,260\nexperiment with the website to see\nif it's actually vulnerable to this.\n\n37\n00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,830\nOnce it is, you know,\nyou can do a lot of things at that point.\n\n38\n00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,190\n>> Yeah, it, it is amazing and I know\nreading your book for like the seventh or\n\n39\n00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:24,770\neighth times.\n\n40\n00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,051\nIt's such a good read.\n\n41\n00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:28,408\nI like.\n>> You only gotta read it once.\n\n42\n00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:29,415\nI only get royalties once.\n\n43\n00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:30,705\n>> [LAUGH] Oh, is that it.\n\n44\n00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:33,311\n[CROSSTALK] You know,\nbut some big players.\n\n45\n00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:37,069\nLike, you said Sony, I mean the DOE,\nthe Department of Energy here in the US,\n\n46\n00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,266\nyou know, NASA I think is one of them\nyou listed as an example in there.\n\n47\n00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,720\n>> That's right.\n\n48\n00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,080\n>> So these are big entities,\n\n49\n00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,000\nthat, they're not, it's not like they're\nnot paying attention to security, right?\n\n50\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,245\nThese guys are, are focused on\nkeeping their information safe.\n\n51\n00:02:49,245 --> 00:02:50,400\nU.S. government, things like that.\n\n52\n00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,640\nAnd, and still, some of the stuff\nslips through the cracks and\n\n53\n00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,487\nthey are susceptible to this.\n\n54\n00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:58,350\n>> Yeah, it's, it, it, it,\nit's definitely a biggie.\n\n55\n00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,780\nThis i-, this is where we're gonna have\nif, if you have an application, a web\n\n56\n00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,160\napplication, we're talking here that uses\nSQL there's, there's a good chance you\n\n57\n00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,732\ncould have problems in there and there's\na number of reasons you know, for that.\n\n58\n00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:14,171\nBut once you have this, and\npeople find it, you know,\n\n59\n00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:17,690\nthey've got a lot of tools and there's\na lot of techniques to help them get in.\n\n60\n00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:18,416\n>> Right.\n\n61\n00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,040\n>> And they can do everything from just,\n\n62\n00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,200\nyou know, from stealing information\nfrom you, to altering information.\n\n63\n00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,800\nTo, in some cases,\nif they're really clever and\n\n64\n00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,750\nreally know what's going on,\nthey can drill all the way down and\n\n65\n00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,910\nstart mapping out your network and opening\nup you know, other holes in your network.\n\n66\n00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,125\nAnd planting malware and stuff like that.\n\n67\n00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,110\n>> Right.\n>> Believe it or\n\n68\n00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,180\nnot, that actually can be done.\n\n69\n00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,640\n>> It's a,\nit is incredibly powerful stuff.\n\n70\n00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,780\nAnd, and the thing is,\nit's not a very difficult fix.\n\n71\n00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,260\nYou know, and\nwe'll talk about how it happens and\n\n72\n00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,780\nwhy it's possible here in a minute.\n\n73\n00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,125\nBut the fix is, is really easy.\n\n74\n00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:54,905\nAnd I know there's a question in the chat\nroom, are there better options than SQL.\n\n75\n00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:59,585\nAnd, and when it comes down to it, this is\nnot a vulnerability of SQL server, like\n\n76\n00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:03,975\nMicrosoft's SQL server or, you know, your\nOracle databases or anything like that.\n\n77\n00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:06,110\nIt's, that's not where\nthe vulnerability lies.\n\n78\n00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,800\nThe actual vulnerability is\nin the web application itself\n\n79\n00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,945\nthat you're presenting\nout there to the public.\n\n80\n00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:13,649\nSo, you know,\n>> Yeah.\n\n81\n00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:18,271\nIt's actually in the, in the logic,\nit's not, it's not the, it's not the SQL,\n\n82\n00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:22,830\nSQL is not a buggy language any more\nthan anything else is ya, ya, know, but,\n\n83\n00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,908\nyou know, for the most part, but it,\nit's how you construct the logic.\n\n84\n00:04:26,908 --> 00:04:28,550\n>> Right.\n>> If you don't think about the logic and\n\n85\n00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,460\ndon't really think about how\nyour applications working then.\n\n86\n00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,516\nYou're gonna put something\ntogether that is vulnerable.\n\n87\n00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,926\n>> Right.\n>> That's the long and short of it.\n\n88\n00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:38,430\n>> Yeah, when,\nwhen we talk about sequel injection.\n\n89\n00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,576\nIt, it's, you're injecting sequel\ncommands and what's happening is,\n\n90\n00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:47,120\nis you've got a webpage or some kind of\napplication that's accepting user input.\n\n91\n00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,460\nAnd most of our websites\ntoday are dynamic, right?\n\n92\n00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,450\nThey deliver dynamic content, which means\nit's gonna change based on who's logged\n\n93\n00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,190\nin or you know, if you click on a button.\n\n94\n00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,350\nYou might go retrieve records\nfrom a database to display\n\n95\n00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,220\na catalog of parts you can buy or\nsomething like that.\n\n96\n00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,820\nWell, that's,\nall that stuff is not on the,\n\n97\n00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,300\nthe webserver,\nit's all in a backend database.\n\n98\n00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,240\nWe talked the other day about end tiers or\nmultiple tier web applications which is\n\n99\n00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,362\nthe most,\none of the most common setups nowadays.\n\n100\n00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:18,740\nYour webserver's just a front end and\nit's gotta reach back into your network to\n\n101\n00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,140\nthe backend either through three tiers or\nsometimes just two tiers but\n\n102\n00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,740\nthat's where that data actually lies\nis in that database on the backend.\n\n103\n00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,290\nAnd so what really we're doing is we're\ntricking the webserver to submit bogus,\n\n104\n00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:39,285\nnot bogus queries, but queries other than\nwhat was intended for that website to do.\n\n105\n00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,520\nAnd, and that's what sequel injection is,\nwe're gonna inject SQL commands.\n\n106\n00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,440\nAnd remember when we say SQL, we're not\ntalking about Microsoft SQL Server,\n\n107\n00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,710\nunfortunate naming convention\nthat Microsoft used there.\n\n108\n00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,810\nYou know, SQL is structured query\nlanguage, or more technically maybe,\n\n109\n00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,220\ntransact SQL, or TSQL and that's a,\nthat's a, independent language.\n\n110\n00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,970\nIt's not a Microsoft specific thing.\n\n111\n00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:04,682\nThey just happened to call\ntheir product SQL Server.\n\n112\n00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:08,805\nAll right so, when we say sequel injection\nwe're not talking about just Microsoft,\n\n113\n00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:12,298\nwe're talking about all of\nthe different database engines that use\n\n114\n00:06:12,298 --> 00:06:14,773\ntransact SQL as their\nlanguage to connect to them.\n\n115\n00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:18,974\n>> Yeah, I think that's a good point, eh,\nto, to, kind of, emphasize in that is for\n\n116\n00:06:18,974 --> 00:06:20,879\nnumerous reasons you know, yeah,\n\n117\n00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,092\nMicrosoft didn't develop even\nthough they call it a product.\n\n118\n00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,263\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Microsoft SQL Server, the,\n\n119\n00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:28,876\nthey're not the ones that developed it.\n\n120\n00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:33,439\nIn fact, I think if, if memory serves,\nthe general genesis of it was IBM.\n\n121\n00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:34,580\n>> Yes, mm-hm.\n\n122\n00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,191\n>> IBM created the first version of\nit back in the 70s, I wanna say.\n\n123\n00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:37,889\n>> I think so.\n\n124\n00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,025\nIt was early on.\n\n125\n00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:43,235\n>> Yeah, it was created a long time ago\nand it was, and it evolved into the,\n\n126\n00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,805\nthe version they use now I believe\nis actually the second version.\n\n127\n00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,975\nIt's not the original version.\n\n128\n00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:48,657\nIt's the second version.\n\n129\n00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:52,107\nBut since it was so powerful and they\nrecogni, and, and other people recognized\n\n130\n00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,965\nwhat they could do with it, you know,\nIBM let other people use it.\n\n131\n00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:57,566\nAnd that's why you see\nit acrossed you know, so\n\n132\n00:06:57,566 --> 00:07:02,237\nmany applications now including SQL Server\nbut there's Oracle and, and, and and, and\n\n133\n00:07:02,237 --> 00:07:04,217\nSybase and, you know, a lot of those.\n\n134\n00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,315\n>> MySQL is an open source\none that you can get,\n\n135\n00:07:06,315 --> 00:07:09,160\na free one that you see\na lot of websites running.\n\n136\n00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,870\n>> Yeah there, there, there's just a,\nthere's a, yeah, there's so\n\n137\n00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:12,930\nmany that use this.\n\n138\n00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,160\nIt's a, it's a universal language.\n\n139\n00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,710\nBut, you know, I, one thing I always\nlike to mention when talking about SQL,\n\n140\n00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,640\nyou know, is that SQL,\neven though it's, eh, you know,\n\n141\n00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,040\nI can say it's a universal language,\nit's like saying, you know, if,\n\n142\n00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,500\nif we're talking here in the US that,\nyou know, English is a universal language.\n\n143\n00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,990\nYeah if we, if we ignore, if we ignore\nthe other the other languages and\n\n144\n00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,145\nsay English is the, just look at\nEnglish as being the the language here.\n\n145\n00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:42,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n146\n00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,750\n>> We don't all speak\nthe same type of English.\n\n147\n00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,230\nYou know, I, I, I could tell you,\nI, I was born, born and\n\n148\n00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,520\nraised in Southern California.\n\n149\n00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I live in Northern California now.\n\n150\n00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,532\nWe don't speak the same English,\njust don't.\n\n151\n00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:53,610\n>> Right?\n\n152\n00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,633\nYou have a hard time understanding people\nfrom from the New England area sometimes.\n\n153\n00:07:57,633 --> 00:07:58,731\n>> Yeah.\n>> And the deep south is,\n\n154\n00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,411\nis a little bit different, right,\n\n155\n00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:04,167\nso a different dialects of the same\nlanguage, and the same thing happens here.\n\n156\n00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,620\nThere's some few Slight\ntweaks in the code for,\n\n157\n00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,670\nif you're doing versus MySQL\nversus SQL versus Oracle.\n\n158\n00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,770\nLike, they might use different characters\nfor commenting out portions of text and\n\n159\n00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,360\nthings like that.\n\n160\n00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,626\nSo, the basic structure of the SQL\nstatement is gonna be the same, but, but\n\n161\n00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:23,490\nbut the, the characters we use for\nsome of that might be slightly different.\n\n162\n00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,530\n>> Yeah, yeah, that's where you gotta get\nyour fluency in, one versus the other.\n\n163\n00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,240\nIf you get good, if you get good enough\nyou know, I've seen people that can pick\n\n164\n00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,190\nout a single character like,\noh, yeah, that's on Oracle.\n\n165\n00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,158\nAnd they can tell just by a single\nsemicolon that's in there, you know?\n\n166\n00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,940\nWhy, you know, a lot of us\nmight look at that going, what?\n\n167\n00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,510\nHow did you know that?\n\n168\n00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,997\nThey, they know just by,\nby picking that up, you know?\n\n169\n00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:47,878\nSo that's, that's another thing that\nmakes it a little tricky, you know,\n\n170\n00:08:47,878 --> 00:08:50,581\ntoo cuz you might get your\nskills built up in one area.\n\n171\n00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:54,782\nAnd then get moved on,\nmoved over to another another company and\n\n172\n00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:58,840\nwork with the database there and\nmaybe a different database,\n\n173\n00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,247\nyou may be a SQL guru with the other one.\n\n174\n00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:04,438\nBut you're gonna have to learn\nthe differences in the, in the,\n\n175\n00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:08,690\nin that language, going to the other\nstuff and they could be minute.\n\n176\n00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:13,580\n>> Exactly you know, so when we look\nat SQL injection, [COUGH] You know one,\n\n177\n00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,358\nthis course is not going to teach you SQL\n>> You know, this is, if you are not\n\n178\n00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:23,288\nfamiliar with the, the structure query\nlanguage check out our SQL classes.\n\n179\n00:09:23,288 --> 00:09:26,262\nWe've got a few different ones\navailable in our library,\n\n180\n00:09:26,262 --> 00:09:30,550\nwhere you can learn about SQL, where you\ncan learn about the language trans ex SQL.\n\n181\n00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,310\n>> This course does assume a certain\namount of knowledge with that,\n\n182\n00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,800\nyou need to be able to write your\nbasics your select statements and\n\n183\n00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,680\nyour insert into and your update\nstatements and things like that.\n\n184\n00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,870\nSo you've got to have a good foundation of\nSQL itself before you can really start to\n\n185\n00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,990\ndo any kind of SQL injection and the first\nthing we really need to do is find the,\n\n186\n00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,715\nthe, the SQL server itself, right?\n\n187\n00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:52,690\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n188\n00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:54,990\n>> And there's several tools I think\nyou mentioned in your book that,\n\n189\n00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,060\nthat can go about doing this.\n\n190\n00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,640\nI don't, I can't remember anything\noff the top of my head but.\n\n191\n00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,410\n>> It was like NQS Squirrel and\nthere's a few,\n\n192\n00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,640\nthere's a few other ones that,\nthat can do that.\n\n193\n00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,230\nIBM has a few that's available.\n\n194\n00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,532\nI believe their app scam product does it.\n\n195\n00:10:09,532 --> 00:10:13,683\nAnd then there's even, just to mention\nthere's even tool bars that you can\n\n196\n00:10:13,683 --> 00:10:16,186\nget for Firefox that,\nthat you go to a website and\n\n197\n00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:20,247\nit will, it will fire off notification\ngoing yeah, this, this, this is it.\n\n198\n00:10:20,247 --> 00:10:25,455\nAnd it will help you actually cuh, craft\nthe statements to inject into the page.\n\n199\n00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:30,506\nI mean that's, that's how easy, and\nI mean that, I mean that, you know,\n\n200\n00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,330\nnot to say oh,\nit's incredibly easy to do now.\n\n201\n00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:33,860\n>> Right.\n\n202\n00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,470\n>> I mean it's easier than it was to do,\nwith these util, these utilities.\n\n203\n00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,990\nYou still have to have a knowledge\nof SQL and, you know, I, I, and I,\n\n204\n00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,920\nI, I would concur, you know, with with\nMike here on this about, about, you know,\n\n205\n00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,180\nIT Pro having these courses on, on SQL.\n\n206\n00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,780\nYou might want to, if this is something\nthat you, that you're gonna pentest, and\n\n207\n00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,925\nyou will pentest it at some point,\nthe web applications.\n\n208\n00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,705\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You, you wanna, you wanna go through,\n\n209\n00:11:01,705 --> 00:11:06,476\nat least get familiar with how the SQL\nlanguage works, write some queries and\n\n210\n00:11:06,476 --> 00:11:10,788\nmost people can figure out a select\nstatement you know, fairly quickly.\n\n211\n00:11:10,788 --> 00:11:12,729\nBut learn how to string things together,\n\n212\n00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,570\nlearn about the dynamics of\nthe language and all that.\n\n213\n00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,550\nOnce you learn it with\nsomething like SQL Server,\n\n214\n00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,780\nyou should be able to port it over to\nother things with, with some effort.\n\n215\n00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,940\nYou just have to initially,\nyou know, dive in and\n\n216\n00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,070\nget your hands dirty with it,\nlearn it so courses like that,\n\n217\n00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,590\nwould, you know, I would say, you know,\nwill highly recommended that you do that.\n\n218\n00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,270\n>> Right.\n\n219\n00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:35,500\nYeah and I was trying to find it real\nquick a link that I could give you.\n\n220\n00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,740\nI know I saw a couple in the chat room\nthere going by which I'm sure are good.\n\n221\n00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,980\nYou know one of the first,\nwe're, we're taking advantage,\n\n222\n00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,090\nwe're talking about SQL injection,\nlet's break it down we're, we're,\n\n223\n00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:49,240\nwe're taking a, a user input and we're\nsubmitting that back to the back end and\n\n224\n00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,740\nthat's being processed by some\ntype of server side scripting.\n\n225\n00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,380\nNow this particular course\nreally focuses on server side.\n\n226\n00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,050\nSome of this could be processed\non client side as well\n\n227\n00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,600\nwhich is gonna change the attack slightly.\n\n228\n00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,500\nThis one really focuses on the server\nside of things, and on the server\n\n229\n00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,670\nwe've got different languages that we can\nuse to make those pages active, right?\n\n230\n00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,340\nLike ASP or PHP.\n\n231\n00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,620\n>> It's another layer there, yes.\n\n232\n00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,680\n>> Yeah, so several different languages\nthat are being used on that back end\n\n233\n00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480\nto process this, but it, what we're\nreally doing, is we're using that\n\n234\n00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,050\nscripting language to take that input and\nbuild a query out of it.\n\n235\n00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,740\nAnd then we're just using,\nuse most of those scripting languages can\n\n236\n00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,930\ncreate a new DVC connection or have\nsome way of connecting to the database.\n\n237\n00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,690\nAnd so\nthey're building the query dynamically and\n\n238\n00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,560\nthen submitting that to the database.\n\n239\n00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,390\nThe results are then coming back and\n\n240\n00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,680\nthey're being processed by your HTML\ncode again to format the page or\n\n241\n00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,840\nwhat have you and then it's sent back out\nto the user for display in their browser.\n\n242\n00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,640\nSo like when you go log onto a webpage,\nyou know,\n\n243\n00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,670\nit, it might pull up your history.\n\n244\n00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,800\nAnd so it might send a query back and\nsay select all from blah, blah,\n\n245\n00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,830\nblah where user equals.\n\n246\n00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,580\nAnd then whatever you've typed in for\nyour user.\n\n247\n00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,650\nSo that's where the really, the, the,\n\n248\n00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,640\nthe, the issue we have is we're\nallowing users to input information\n\n249\n00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,850\nthat's being used to generate the queries\nthat are being sent back to that database.\n\n250\n00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,560\nSo if I can manipulate that somehow and\nchange what query's being built and\n\n251\n00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,660\nsent back to that SQL server or,\nyou know, whatever the server may be.\n\n252\n00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,590\nThat's where I'm able\nto start getting into\n\n253\n00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:27,230\ninformation that I shouldn't be getting\ninto, possibly modifying records,\n\n254\n00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,940\ndeleting tables, enumerating other\ndatabases that might be on that server.\n\n255\n00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,160\nAs you said, getting, you know, eh,\nwe can take it even further and\n\n256\n00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,300\nget out of SQL and get into the operating\nsystem and start doing, really bad things.\n\n257\n00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,050\nSo the, the choices are, I mean,\nthe possibilities are numerous.\n\n258\n00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,940\n>> Yeah, a lot of this is,\nyou know, is not news,\n\n259\n00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,370\nalso it's not just learning\nhow the language takes.\n\n260\n00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,460\nIt's also learning the capabilities of\nthe system you're going into and and\n\n261\n00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,420\nwhat's running on the back end.\n\n262\n00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,680\nYou know,\ngetting into the operating system\n\n263\n00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,050\nthat requires a specific knowledge of\nthe database engine that's running and\n\n264\n00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:04,050\nhow to find out if certain\noptions are enabled or not.\n\n265\n00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,954\nYou know so that and once you find\nthose out, then yes, you can do some,\n\n266\n00:14:07,954 --> 00:14:10,455\nyou can do some pretty fascinating things.\n\n267\n00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:15,030\nIt's literally possible, like I said,\nto map out a network to get information on\n\n268\n00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:19,247\nvarious hosts, to plant malware,\nto download stuff onto someone's system.\n\n269\n00:14:19,247 --> 00:14:24,340\nYou know, that's, when you talk about SQL\ninjections initially when you just get in,\n\n270\n00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,735\nyou think, well, you know,\nI can manipulate the database,\n\n271\n00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:32,380\nwhich is absolutely true, but\nthat's not all you can all you can do.\n\n272\n00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,590\nPart of our thing here is going to be\nto open your eyes to some of the other\n\n273\n00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,510\npossibilities of things you can do\nwith this because there are a lot.\n\n274\n00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,800\nSo you know we got, we got,\n\n275\n00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,710\nsome, big goals to accomplish here\n>> Great.\n\n276\n00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,140\nYeah, you know, I keep trying to,\n\n277\n00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,813\nto find this link that I had earlier\nthat shows us some examples of,\n\n278\n00:14:47,813 --> 00:14:50,663\nyou know, some of the things we can\ndo to try to find those SQL servers.\n\n279\n00:14:50,663 --> 00:14:53,983\nShawn mentioned a, a few good tools\nthat we could use, how you can also,\n\n280\n00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:57,110\nremember we talked about the,\nthe Google hacking database.\n\n281\n00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,016\nAnd they call it Google dorking for\nsome reason instead of Google hacking, but\n\n282\n00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:06,501\nanyway, what they are talking about is,\nyou know, finding a SQL server and\n\n283\n00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:10,356\nwe started doing N URL's and\nwhat you're looking for is, like,\n\n284\n00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:15,120\nat the end of that URL where it has that\nquestion mark, ID equals and then 105 or\n\n285\n00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,497\nsomething like that.\n\n286\n00:15:16,497 --> 00:15:20,455\nSo this is how you know that\nthat system is, is doing an HTTP\n\n287\n00:15:20,455 --> 00:15:24,942\npost process to take that information\nthat you've typed into a form and\n\n288\n00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:28,040\nsubmitting it back against that database.\n\n289\n00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,538\nSo that's one way you can find a SQL\nserver as well is actually, use Google.\n\n290\n00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:37,223\nLet Google search for URLs that\nhave that PHP slash question mark,\n\n291\n00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:40,080\nyou know id equals or what have you.\n\n292\n00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,151\nAnd I, I had a good list of those and I'll\nfind them before the, the day's over and\n\n293\n00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,635\nmake sure you guys have them, but that's\njust one example, I mean that's just PHP,\n\n294\n00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:52,543\nwe can also look for ASP and other\nscripting languages back there as well.\n\n295\n00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:55,938\nOnce we've done that,\nonce you've found the SQL server, or\n\n296\n00:15:55,938 --> 00:15:58,487\nthe server that's running\nthe SQL database,\n\n297\n00:15:58,487 --> 00:16:03,080\nThe next step then would be to determine\nwhether or not it's vulnerable to attack.\n\n298\n00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:09,040\nYou know, and a couple ways you can,\nyou can go about that, one of the ways\n\n299\n00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,460\nthat I typically do it is you just put\nan apostrophe, a single apostrophe in\n\n300\n00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,329\nthe username and the password field,\nyou hit enter, then you see what happens.\n\n301\n00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:21,520\nAnd if the website does\nnot return an error\n\n302\n00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,900\nthen most likely it's not going to be\nsusceptible to your SQL injection.\n\n303\n00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,330\nIf it does return an error, then there's\na very good chance that that's going to be\n\n304\n00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,610\nsusceptible to the SQL injection and\nwe can move on with our attack.\n\n305\n00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,818\nAnd really what it's coming down to is,\nis that website designed to handle\n\n306\n00:16:40,818 --> 00:16:46,040\nc characters that shouldn't be allowed,\nis really what it comes down to.\n\n307\n00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,998\n>> It should, it should also, with what\nMike's describing is enough to tell you\n\n308\n00:16:50,998 --> 00:16:54,180\nbased on stuff we've\ntalked about previously.\n\n309\n00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,985\nSome of the defenses against this too.\n\n310\n00:16:55,985 --> 00:16:56,860\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You should,\n\n311\n00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,360\nyou should already start be,\nyou should already thinking about that.\n\n312\n00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,650\nYou know, if you were allowed to put you\nknow, these characters, apostrophes and\n\n313\n00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,005\nstuff like that in the fields, what can\nyou do defensively to prevent that?\n\n314\n00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:07,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Yes, and\n\n315\n00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,758\nthere is stuff in the SQL\nlanguage you can do.\n\n316\n00:17:10,758 --> 00:17:15,156\nBut there's stuff outside of that you can\ndo to make sure that stuff like this is,\n\n317\n00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,947\nis less likely to happen,\nto lock stuff down.\n\n318\n00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:19,174\n>> Yeah, exactly, you know,\n\n319\n00:17:19,174 --> 00:17:22,230\nthink about what we talked\nabout in our previous episode.\n\n320\n00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,960\nThe big thing is that input validation.\n\n321\n00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,750\nShould that apostrophe be allowed\nin that user dialog box or\n\n322\n00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,570\nthat password dialog box,\nand if we're, if we're, and\n\n323\n00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,150\nif it, if it doesn't return an error, that\nmeans they're probably doing things right.\n\n324\n00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,210\nThey're probably sanitizing that data\nbefore it gets submitted back to that SQL\n\n325\n00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,010\nback in, so no errors produce.\n\n326\n00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,440\nWhereas if you put that apostrophe,\nor a lot of times,\n\n327\n00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,340\nI'll put blah apostrophe 1 equals 1,\n\n328\n00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,760\nas another one you can see people using\nto see what kind of error it throws back.\n\n329\n00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,450\nIf you get an error,\n\n330\n00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,640\nthat means what you type in was actually\nbeing submitted to the SQL server.\n\n331\n00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,774\nAnd so that's my first indication that,\nwait a second,\n\n332\n00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:04,960\nI can manipulate what's being\ntransmitted back to that SQL server.\n\n333\n00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,660\nNow I'm in business,there's a really good\nchance I could pull off this attack.\n\n334\n00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,580\nSo you're looking for an error,\nwhich is kinda odd right?\n\n335\n00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,460\nNormally you think you\ndon't want an error...\n\n336\n00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,890\nBut the error indicates you're going\nto have a good chance of success.\n\n337\n00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,370\nAnd then the error itself is where I\ncan get a lot of information back about\n\n338\n00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,740\nthe SQL server, and I might say failure\nto create Microsoft ODBC connection,\n\n339\n00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,100\nyou know, blah blah blah, so.\n\n340\n00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,790\nGives you some information\nabout the server,\n\n341\n00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,400\npossibly even version\ninformation about the server and\n\n342\n00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,560\nthings like that so are they running\nMicrosoft SQL, is it a My SQL database?\n\n343\n00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,760\nIs it an Oracle database?\n\n344\n00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,580\nEach one of those has different error\nmessages that it might kick back.\n\n345\n00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,710\nSo with a little practice,\na little experience,\n\n346\n00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,850\nwe can start to determine what the,\nwhat the, the database, what the arg,\n\n347\n00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,800\nif I could say that right,\nrelational database management engine.\n\n348\n00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,680\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What engine they're using back there,\n\n349\n00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,370\nwhich can then help me\ncustomize my code or\n\n350\n00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,280\nmy attack that I want\nto send back to them.\n\n351\n00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,620\nSo, it, it's all about input validation\nand that's what we said in the beginning.\n\n352\n00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,720\nIf it's so easy to prevent this,\nall right,\n\n353\n00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,500\nit's not the SQL server\nthat has to be patched.\n\n354\n00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,410\nIt's the code that's on\nthe web application, if, if,\n\n355\n00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,530\nI'm not allowed to type out more than\n15 characters in a user name field\n\n356\n00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:20,000\nthen I can't write my entire\nSQL query in there, right?\n\n357\n00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,430\nIf I can't put dashes and\nhyphens and, and slashes and\n\n358\n00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,910\nthings like that in a user name field,\nthen I can't carry out my SQL injection.\n\n359\n00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,690\nSo it's as simple that,\njust writing code in the HTML to,\n\n360\n00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,610\nto strip out any illegal characters before\nit gets submitted back or to make them,\n\n361\n00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,740\nyou know, wipe the fields and\nmake them type it in again.\n\n362\n00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,520\nSay hey, this isn't an allowed character\nin a username or a password field.\n\n363\n00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,350\nIf you do that,\nthey can't do the SQL injection, right?\n\n364\n00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,990\nBut that's something\nwe've gotta worry about.\n\n365\n00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,100\nAny time you're gonna allow a user\n\n366\n00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,410\nto input data to help you build\na query dynamically, you have\n\n367\n00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,250\ngot to make sure that you're controlling\nwhat they're allowed to put in there.\n\n368\n00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,300\nAnd as for the, as a bad guy or as a pin\ntester, this is what I'm looking for.\n\n369\n00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,515\nI wanna see how well\ntheir code is written.\n\n370\n00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:08,495\nAre they sanitizing that data?\n\n371\n00:20:08,495 --> 00:20:13,675\nAnd I'm gonna just fire things like\nthat hyphen hyphen at, how easy is that?\n\n372\n00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,675\nI've done,\nnot even using Google dorking, you know,\n\n373\n00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:18,725\njust do a Google search for\nlog on pages, you know?\n\n374\n00:20:19,735 --> 00:20:22,825\nAnd you just click on each link and\nput a hyp, a hyphen hyphen or a,\n\n375\n00:20:22,825 --> 00:20:24,925\na apostrophe apostrophe, hit enter.\n\n376\n00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:26,495\nNothing.\nAll right, go to the next link.\n\n377\n00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,295\nHyphen hyphen, nothing,\ngo to the next link.\n\n378\n00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:29,770\nHyphen hyphen, woah.\n\n379\n00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,930\nError message and nonstop and\nI'm taking a closer look.\n\n380\n00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,200\nI mean not that I would really\ndo this in the real world\n\n381\n00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,330\n>> Of course, never.\n\n382\n00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,885\n>> It was with permission of course.\n\n383\n00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:43,700\n>> [LAUGH] It is important to mention\na like, an interject here the,\n\n384\n00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:48,800\nit's not, you, Mike's right, you will\nget an error message on, you know, on,\n\n385\n00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,090\non, this stuff, but\nthen again, you might not.\n\n386\n00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,630\nIf someone's been smart about it,\n\n387\n00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,290\nthey can actually put, something that\ndoesn't actually give you a dir,\n\n388\n00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,780\na blatant error message saying this\nfailed and this is what happened.\n\n389\n00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,720\nThey may give you\nsomething that says oops.\n\n390\n00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,310\nYou know, this doesn't, this doesn't,\nit didn't, something didn't happen.\n\n391\n00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,030\nThat, that gets to be a little,\na little tougher.\n\n392\n00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,260\nAnd that's something you know, we'll,\n\n393\n00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,860\nwe'll wait a bit to discuss\nhow you deal with that.\n\n394\n00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,060\nBut yeah, there,\nthere are people are getting smarter.\n\n395\n00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,660\nYou know about how to defend against\nthis instead of just throwing up,\n\n396\n00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,300\npuking some code up and\nsaying this is what happened.\n\n397\n00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,610\nThey might very well say that we're\nunable to service your request or\n\n398\n00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,830\nyou know, something didn't go as expected.\n\n399\n00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,380\nThat doesn't give you much, you know, as\nopposed to, as opposed to the other side.\n\n400\n00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:35,670\nBut it does give you enough\nif you know how to handle it.\n\n401\n00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,220\nIt does give you enough to go to the next\nstep and figure out how to, you know,\n\n402\n00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,770\nhow to proceed with your potential attack.\n\n403\n00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,921\n>> Yeah, it still is the case that that\nserver might have vulnerability we can\n\n404\n00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:45,772\ntake advantage of,\n\n405\n00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:49,160\nit's just going to make it a lot\nmore difficult to take advantage of.\n\n406\n00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,110\n>> Yeah, you're, you're, you're,\n\n407\n00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,620\nyou're gonna be doing it blind in\nessence blind for a bit at that point.\n\n408\n00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:00,170\nSo you just have to figure out how you can\ndetermine things without getting you know,\n\n409\n00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,230\novert feedback.\n\n410\n00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,730\n>> Right, right.\n\n411\n00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,060\nAll right, I tell you what,\nwe wanna dive into some of the code and\n\n412\n00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,380\nsome of the things tat we can,\nwe can actually,\n\n413\n00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,098\nonce we've found a vulnerable server\nsome of the things that we can do.\n\n414\n00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:16,111\nBut I don't want to break that up, so\nI think this is probably a good point for\n\n415\n00:22:16,111 --> 00:22:20,187\nus to, to, stop, take a quick break and\nwhen we come back we'll start taking\n\n416\n00:22:20,187 --> 00:22:23,571\na look at, at some of the SQL commands or\nhow we might go about\n\n417\n00:22:23,571 --> 00:22:27,060\ndoing the SQL Injection itself and\nactually writing the codes.\n\n418\n00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,523\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n419\n00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:35,518\n[MUSIC]\n\n420\n00:22:35,518 --> 00:22:37,620\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n421\n00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,140\nContinuing on with our SQL Injection\nchapter, we want to take a look now at,\n\n422\n00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,590\nat, the actual process of\ndoing the SQL injection.\n\n423\n00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,620\nWe talked earlier about how\nto find the SQL servers.\n\n424\n00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,970\nAnd one more thing I want\nto mention about that.\n\n425\n00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:54,600\nIn fact, before we go on into the,\nthe coding is, is I, I mention, you know,\n\n426\n00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,238\nsome different Google\nsearches you could do.\n\n427\n00:22:57,238 --> 00:23:00,210\nTo possibly find your SQL servers,\nand I found a list, and I,\n\n428\n00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,630\nI put the link in the chat room, and I'm\njust showing you the actual lists here.\n\n429\n00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:11,070\nAnd these are the kinds of things\nthat I can do, like, inurl:index.php?\n\n430\n00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,060\nID equals, all right or any of these guys,\nand you can see, they've,\n\n431\n00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,170\nthey've just thrown a bunch\nof different possibilities.\n\n432\n00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,900\nBut notice the similarity,\nthey all end in php?id A d equals.\n\n433\n00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,690\nThat's really on some of them file equals.\n\n434\n00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,250\nAll right?\n\n435\n00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:32,500\nThat's what we're looking for\nthere's a, there is a category equal.\n\n436\n00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:37,130\nThat's a dead giveaway that they\nare asking the user for input so\n\n437\n00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,040\nthat they can go back and retrieve data.\n\n438\n00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,730\nLike, you might have clicked on\na particular category on a shopping page.\n\n439\n00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,580\nLike, I wanna look at, you know,\nhard drives, internal hard drives.\n\n440\n00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,380\nSo you are going to see\nsomething like this, and\n\n441\n00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,810\nif I go back to that server saying,\nall right, pull me back.\n\n442\n00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,702\nIt's going to,\n\n443\n00:23:52,702 --> 00:23:57,161\nthe web server is going to just send this\nform information back to that middle tier,\n\n444\n00:23:57,161 --> 00:24:01,125\nthat application server then is going\nto process it with in this case PHP.\n\n445\n00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:05,407\nFormulate that query based on what you've\ninput or what you've clicked on, or\n\n446\n00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:08,140\na drop down list you picked,\nor whatever it might be.\n\n447\n00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,050\nAnd then it's gonna send\nthat query to the database.\n\n448\n00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,380\nThe database is gonna retrieve all\nitems with a category, you know,\n\n449\n00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,300\nequal to hard drives.\n\n450\n00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,130\nSends that back for the processing on that\napplication server, Formats your web page,\n\n451\n00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,730\ncreates that HTML code, and sends it\nout to your browser, and bada bing,\n\n452\n00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,140\nyou've got a web page that shows all\nthese different hard drives that you buy.\n\n453\n00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,850\nSo that's the general process and\nthat's what we're looking for.\n\n454\n00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,740\nThis doesn't say they're\nsusceptible to attack.\n\n455\n00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,690\nThis is just saying that\nthey are taking user input\n\n456\n00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,445\nto formulate a query in the back end.\n\n457\n00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:40,637\nAll right?\n\n458\n00:24:40,637 --> 00:24:41,347\n>> All right.\n\n459\n00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,147\n>> All right, so now,\nif we take a look at the code, and\n\n460\n00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:47,060\nthis is by no means a complete\nlist of things we can do.\n\n461\n00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,430\nAnd if you wanna get into SQL Injection,\nI mean,\n\n462\n00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,150\nit's, it's really a topic in and\nof itself I think.\n\n463\n00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,810\nIt, it's pretty powerful stuff, but,\na few things that we can do, and\n\n464\n00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,660\nagain, we're not gonna learn Transact SQL\nin this, in this class, though if you need\n\n465\n00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,470\na refresher, go back and watch the,\nthe SQL class is in our course library.\n\n466\n00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,820\nBut you might find, go ahead.\n\n467\n00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,750\n>> Re, re, reme, reme I was gonna say\nremember for for all of you that a,\n\n468\n00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,590\na lot of the stuff that\nmight show in here, I was,\n\n469\n00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,780\nthis is actually a starting point for\na lot of more advanced stuff.\n\n470\n00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,450\nSo saying there's a lot you can do\nwith it, this is, some of this acts as\n\n471\n00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,380\na starting point, to go in to progress\ninto those more complex things.\n\n472\n00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,740\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n473\n00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,930\nThis is just amazing stuff.\n\n474\n00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,590\nSo what I've got here up at the top is,\n\n475\n00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,720\nis there is a few different\nthings you might look for and\n\n476\n00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,250\na few different ways you might choose to\nattack depending on what the server is.\n\n477\n00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,940\nIs it a, a Microsoft SQL server?\n\n478\n00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,340\nIs it a MySQL server?\n\n479\n00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:43,740\nAnd depending on how they've got their\nback in their code, their ASP or their PHP\n\n480\n00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,780\nor whatever, however they are generating\nthat query, now here's an example\n\n481\n00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,360\nwhere I can see they've got a variable\nthey're creating, TEXTUSERID equals.\n\n482\n00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,710\nGet request string and\nthen in quotes here user id.\n\n483\n00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,310\nSo I mean, that's telling me\nthat they've got a form, and\n\n484\n00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,610\none of the text boxes on that\nform on that webpage, is named,\n\n485\n00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,830\ntxtUserId, right?\n\n486\n00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,630\nSo what they're doing is\nthey're retrieving that\n\n487\n00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,040\nfield that's whatever you've typed in,\nstoring it in this variable txtUserId.\n\n488\n00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,080\nSo I guess I should change that.\n\n489\n00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,270\nThis would be the field name\nmost likely on the form and\n\n490\n00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,180\nthen this would be the variable that\nthey're gonna store that information in.\n\n491\n00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,380\nThen, and this is all in the code, right?\n\n492\n00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,560\nThis is not anything I'm doing.\n\n493\n00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,440\nThis is what they've got\nwritten on their back end.\n\n494\n00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,420\nAnd then they're gonna create another\nvariable called txt SQL equals.\n\n495\n00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,240\nAnd then the transact SQL statement\nthat they wanna generate.\n\n496\n00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,880\nAnd all they're doing is they're\nwriting a very simple select all,\n\n497\n00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,120\nasterisk meaning all.\n\n498\n00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,720\nFrom users and they've got a table\ncalled users where user id equals and\n\n499\n00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,370\nit in quotes because our\nstring needs to be in quotes.\n\n500\n00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,740\nOh I'm sorry, the quote is for\n\n501\n00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:59,160\nthis first part, lemme drag that around,\nthat quote there covers this quote here.\n\n502\n00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,700\nRight?\n\n503\n00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:04,390\nAnd they're impatenating that,\neither plugging two strings together and\n\n504\n00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,050\nthen whatever it is you typed in, right?\n\n505\n00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:09,850\nThis TXT user ID equals\nwhatever you type in.\n\n506\n00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:12,240\nWhatever you retrieve from the webpage,\nall right?\n\n507\n00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,570\nSo that's their code.\n\n508\n00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,020\nSo what would happen if I put in something\nlike in the username dialog box, right?\n\n509\n00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,350\nSo I, I'm going to their webpage,\nthey've got a username and\n\n510\n00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:23,000\na password dialog box here.\n\n511\n00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,634\nI type in 105 or 1 equals 1.\n\n512\n00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:31,570\nWell if we look at the query and\nwe follow along and we plug this in so\n\n513\n00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,060\nthat this is gonna be stuck here.\n\n514\n00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,920\nWhich is now this variable which\nthen gets incandinated here.\n\n515\n00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,610\nSo in the end, my statement says\n\n516\n00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:48,440\nselect all from users where user\nid equals 105 or 1 equals 1.\n\n517\n00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,100\nRemember an or statement,\neither half has to be true.\n\n518\n00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,940\nSo, either the user id equals 105 and\nthen it becomes a valid result I should\n\n519\n00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,535\nsend back in my select statement,\nor 1 equals 1.\n\n520\n00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,250\nWell, wait a second.\n\n521\n00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,280\nWhen does 1 equal 1?\n\n522\n00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,520\n>> Always.\n>> Always, right?\n\n523\n00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,250\nSo you're saying that, either the ID, and\n\n524\n00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,520\nyou don't even care if this is a valid ID,\nright?\n\n525\n00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,660\nEither it equals 105, or 1 equals 1.\n\n526\n00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,030\nWell, of course 1 equals 1.\n\n527\n00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,390\nSo every record is gonna\nbe returned at this point.\n\n528\n00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:23,190\nYou're gonna get a list of all users, or\neverything that's in their users table,\n\n529\n00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,110\nall right?\n\n530\n00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:28,540\nThat's one way we can go\nabout doing a SQL injection,\n\n531\n00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,860\njust basing it on whether 1 equals 1.\n\n532\n00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,050\nYou're just trying to get\nsomething that is true, right?\n\n533\n00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,410\nAnother possibility is where you've\ngot a equals is always true.\n\n534\n00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,470\nSo they've got a little\ndifferent code here.\n\n535\n00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,420\nThey've got a variable user name or\n\n536\n00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:47,980\nuname, and then their get request string,\nand there's a field on the form\n\n537\n00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,270\ncalled username where you've\ntyped in your username.\n\n538\n00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,510\nThere's another field called user\npass where you've typed that in.\n\n539\n00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:59,860\nAnd their SQL statement says select all\nfrom users where name equals, all right.\n\n540\n00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,600\nAnd then there's a single\napostrophe right there.\n\n541\n00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000\nAnd then the double quote that ends this,\nall right?\n\n542\n00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:13,224\nSo we're gonna be concatenating that with\nwhatever you put in that username field,\n\n543\n00:29:13,224 --> 00:29:13,805\nright?\n\n544\n00:29:13,805 --> 00:29:18,568\nAnd, this is where really, understanding\nyour syntax is gonna become key, and it's\n\n545\n00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:23,135\ngonna be a little difficult for, I can't,\nI can't teach you everything we need to\n\n546\n00:29:23,135 --> 00:29:28,055\nknow here, but if you look at the quotes\nthis is what's actually being right?\n\n547\n00:29:28,055 --> 00:29:30,800\nThe outer quotes are saying,\nhere's one string.\n\n548\n00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,040\nSo there's the open apostrophe,\n\n549\n00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,420\nthat single quote right there is actually\nthe open quote for the sequel statement.\n\n550\n00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:43,990\nPlug in the username,\nthat with another quote, all right?\n\n551\n00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,190\nAnd then and pass equals and the same\nthing, we're just gonna take that,\n\n552\n00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,410\nwhatever you typed in the password field,\nand plug it in there, and\n\n553\n00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:53,350\nnow I've got my sequel statement.\n\n554\n00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,850\nAll right?\n\n555\n00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:58,760\nIf we type in for\nthe user name an equal sign, and for\n\n556\n00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,200\nthe password an equal sign,\nwe end up with something like this.\n\n557\n00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,800\nAgain, this is the data that's\nbeing put into here, and\n\n558\n00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,750\nbeing used to generate the SQL statement.\n\n559\n00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:16,200\nSo the SQL statement ends up being, select\nall from users, where name equals blank or\n\n560\n00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,980\nempty string, or equals equal,\nor equals always equals equal,\n\n561\n00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:27,670\nso that's true, and pass equals either\nblank string, or an equal sign,\n\n562\n00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:33,030\nand, again, equals always is true or\nas you would say an equals is always true.\n\n563\n00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,600\nSo because we're submit in this case\nthey're doing an and statement.\n\n564\n00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,155\nSo I've got to make sure that\nthis half equals true, and\n\n565\n00:30:40,155 --> 00:30:43,815\nthis half equals true, which is why we\nhad to put something in both fields there\n\n566\n00:30:43,815 --> 00:30:46,345\nto make sure both of those return true.\n\n567\n00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,065\nAnd so, in the end,\n\n568\n00:30:47,065 --> 00:30:51,912\nwhat you're gonna get out of this is\nanother complete Select All From Users.\n\n569\n00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:53,042\nAnd we can change that.\n\n570\n00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,512\nWe don't have to do\na Select All from users, right?\n\n571\n00:30:55,512 --> 00:30:59,892\nOnce you start learning your transact SQL,\nyou can choose other commands.\n\n572\n00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:05,296\nYou can start enumerating columns trying\nto figure out how many columns there are R\n\n573\n00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:10,176\nand then start trying to figure out\nwhich columns accept modifications and\n\n574\n00:31:10,176 --> 00:31:15,746\nthen we just modify our query and\nwe change it up, all right?\n\n575\n00:31:15,746 --> 00:31:20,756\nSo not that difficult if you know\nyour trans x equal and you're\n\n576\n00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:24,336\njust trying to figure out, you know, what\ncode are they using in the back, you know?\n\n577\n00:31:24,336 --> 00:31:28,019\nAnd you just play with it,\ntry a few and see what ends up working\n\n578\n00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,900\na third one we can do down here is a SQL\ninjection based on batched SQL statements.\n\n579\n00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:38,640\nAnd in here,\nwe can see that the server code\n\n580\n00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,630\nis kind of the same as that\nfirst one we looked at, right?\n\n581\n00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:45,580\nI've got a txtUserId,\ngetRequestString UserId\n\n582\n00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,610\ntext SQL equals select all from\nusers where user id equals.\n\n583\n00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,500\nAnd we're concatenating that with\nwhatever you typed in that user id field.\n\n584\n00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:55,042\nRight?\n\n585\n00:31:55,042 --> 00:32:01,875\nFor my input text,\nI'm gonna put 105; Drop table suppliers.\n\n586\n00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:03,088\nAll right.\n\n587\n00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:07,824\nAnd what that ends up reading as, is I\nhope that we can see that at the bottom of\n\n588\n00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:11,220\nmy, I know I'm down at the bottom here.\n\n589\n00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,930\nSelect all from users where user ID equals\n105 semicolon, drop table, suppliers.\n\n590\n00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,790\nA semi colon in SQL is a way to end one\nstatement and start another statement.\n\n591\n00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,700\nSo when we're writing that SQL code\nI can group together or batch,\n\n592\n00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,340\nmultiple SQL statements by putting\na semi colon at the end of each one.\n\n593\n00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,830\nSo that's exactly what we're doing here.\n\n594\n00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:35,350\nWe already know how this works.\n\n595\n00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,700\nRight?\nAnd now we're just saying, okay, end that.\n\n596\n00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,830\nAnd then run this command.\n\n597\n00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,860\nThis might not even work, right.\n\n598\n00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,730\nThere might not be a user 105.\n\n599\n00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,240\nBut that's okay.\n\n600\n00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,490\nThat command might not work, but\n\n601\n00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,280\nit's gonna still fire the other command,\ndrop table suppliers.\n\n602\n00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,160\nAnd if you're unfamiliar with SQL,\ndrop table means delete the table.\n\n603\n00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,590\nAll right, remove the entire table.\n\n604\n00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,490\nNow we would have had to enumerate table\nnames to get that supplier's table name.\n\n605\n00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,920\nBut if you're, again, if you're\nfamiliar with SQL, there's lots of,\n\n606\n00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:07,970\nthere's the like, in, in,\nMicrosoft, there's a schema table.\n\n607\n00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,440\nAll right?\nThere's an information underscore schema,\n\n608\n00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,950\nwhich includes information about all\nthe databases, the database names.\n\n609\n00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,440\nThe tables that exist\nwithin those databases.\n\n610\n00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,920\nThe columns that exist\nwithin those tables.\n\n611\n00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:22,960\nThe data type that ex,\nthat is being set on those columns.\n\n612\n00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,540\nAll that information is\nin this schema table.\n\n613\n00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,200\nAnd we can find that and\n\n614\n00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,790\nwe can start enumerating information\nout of there to get table names.\n\n615\n00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,440\nSo it's, it's, you know, when,\nwhen you look at it, it's really not.\n\n616\n00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,160\nI hate to say it's not complex, because I,\n\n617\n00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,510\nI've, I'm familiar with\n>> It is.\n\n618\n00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,340\n[LAUGH]\n>> Terms like SQL.\n\n619\n00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,170\nSo eh, eh,\nit doesn't look that complex to me.\n\n620\n00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,560\nBut what they'll usually, I know,\nlike in your book, you use the term,\n\n621\n00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,720\nit's a steep learning curve.\n\n622\n00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,620\nBecause you do have to under,\nwhere a lot of these attacks,\n\n623\n00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,880\nI don't need to understand a lot\nof the underlying technology.\n\n624\n00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,830\nThis one, you,\nyou've gotta know your transact SQL, and\n\n625\n00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,750\nthat's not something that everybody knows.\n\n626\n00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:04,690\n>> So it take, it takes some time to\ngain fluency you know, in, in this,\n\n627\n00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,610\nin this language, and then it takes a lot\nof being creative and realize that you're\n\n628\n00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,840\ngonna hit, well, you're gonna bump up\nagainst walls you know, several times\n\n629\n00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,085\nbefore you get a, usually several times\nbefore you get a successful result.\n\n630\n00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:17,590\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n631\n00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:20,840\n>> I mean, there's a, there's a, a,\njust a, a tremendous amount of power here.\n\n632\n00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,120\nThat's why a lot of people put in\nthe time or, or get a tool or, you know,\n\n633\n00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,810\nget someone that's an expert, that's,\nthat's, that's that's good, that's,\n\n634\n00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,755\nthat's good at this stuff.\n\n635\n00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:30,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n636\n00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,890\n>> You know, you may wonder why,\nyou know, why Mike's doing,\n\n637\n00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:34,355\ndoing more of this than I am.\n\n638\n00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:35,470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n639\n00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,577\n>> Se, SQL is not one of my\n\n640\n00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:37,360\nfavorite things.\n\n641\n00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,421\nHe eats the stuff for breakfast.\n\n642\n00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:39,466\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So he gets to do it.\n\n643\n00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,053\nThat's why I was, like,\nyou got volunteered.\n\n644\n00:34:41,053 --> 00:34:42,585\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, so.\n\n645\n00:34:42,585 -->

Yeah.\n\n649\n00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,770\nVoluntold, is what it is.\n\n650\n00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,460\n>> The volunteer assistants say whoever\nwants to volunteer please step forward,\n\n651\n00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,531\nSean does this.\n\n652\n00:34:54,531 --> 00:34:56,746\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n653\n00:34:56,746 --> 00:34:59,420\n>> [LAUGH] So yeah.\n\n654\n00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,470\nIt is, it's, it's a steep curve\nbecause there's a lot to it right?\n\n655\n00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:07,390\nYou've gotta to not only understand\nthe attack, how to find the SQL server and\n\n656\n00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:09,180\nhow to find out if it's vulnerable.\n\n657\n00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,600\nThen you have to actually understand\nthe transact SQL language itself.\n\n658\n00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,440\nAnd it's not a,\nuh,an easy language, you know.\n\n659\n00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,900\nIt's to me it's almost readable, but\nmost people look at that and go, what?\n\n660\n00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,570\nSo it takes a little practice.\n\n661\n00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,420\nBut you guys have the tools available for\nthat.\n\n662\n00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,590\nOne, you've got all of our episodes\nthat you can watch in our library.\n\n663\n00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,510\nI always tell people, in Access,\nwhen you're writing a query, everybody's\n\n664\n00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:35,580\ndragging a dropping things into little\nnice the query generator that Access has.\n\n665\n00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,090\nYou actually can go up to your view\nmenu and change to SQL view and\n\n666\n00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,650\nyou can write the query using the GUI and\nthen you can click SQL view and\n\n667\n00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,430\nsee what got generated, right?\n\n668\n00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:49,820\nAnd you can learn Transact SQL\nby looking at that.\n\n669\n00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,030\nSo you know use your tools\nyou have to start, to start,\n\n670\n00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:56,040\nlearning that Transact SQL cuz it is, one,\n\n671\n00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,336\nI think it's something everybody should\nknow because everybody loves databases.\n\n672\n00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:03,140\n>> Wish [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No, it's, it's, you know,\n\n673\n00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,910\nif it's something you do at your job\nyou might know this, if it's not and\n\n674\n00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,140\nyou're doing a pen testing,\nas Sean says you,\n\n675\n00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,900\nyou've got to have some\nof those basics down.\n\n676\n00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,960\nYou've gotta at least be able to generate\na few Transact SQL statements so\n\n677\n00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,120\nyou can test whether or\nnot your clients' web application\n\n678\n00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,970\nthat enter your system is\nvulnerable to this type of attack.\n\n679\n00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:25,930\n>> Yeah, I've got, see myself you know,\nI have a, you know, knowledge of SQL.\n\n680\n00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,880\nIt's, it's not my favorite, it's not\nmy favorite you know, thing at all,\n\n681\n00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,391\nyou know, just so, so\nI refuse to acknowledge its existence.\n\n682\n00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,072\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So therefore when he said he knew SQL,\n\n683\n00:36:36,072 --> 00:36:38,891\nI'm like well guess what\nyou're doing tomorrow?\n\n684\n00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:40,128\n>> Yeah.\n>> That pretty much.\n\n685\n00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:41,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, and\n\n686\n00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,400\nit is one of those things where\nif you don't use it you lose it.\n\n687\n00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,840\nI mean, I had, I had to brush up last\nnight and make sure I had my Transact SQL\n\n688\n00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:52,740\ndown, cuz if it, if it's not something you\ndo every day it, you're gonna lose the,\n\n689\n00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,270\nthe, the, the intricacies of\nthe syntax is what starts going away,\n\n690\n00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,930\nlike, what the heck was it,\nis it a single quote or a double quote?\n\n691\n00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,290\nIs it two dashes or an asterisk for\na comment, you know, and things like that.\n\n692\n00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:10,380\nAnd that's one that I didn't put on here\nbut a lot of times what I can do is,\n\n693\n00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,810\nlet's say back in,\ncan we pull my screen up one more time.\n\n694\n00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:16,070\nYou know, in a situation like\nthis where maybe I just want\n\n695\n00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,010\nto plug something into the user name part,\nand I don't want to do any of this.\n\n696\n00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,490\nAlright.\nThere might be a scenario where I,\n\n697\n00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,510\nI need to do something like that.\n\n698\n00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,650\nIn here, I might put, a,\na dash dash after this.\n\n699\n00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,315\nI might put a semicolon dash dash\nafter that equals for the user name.\n\n700\n00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:34,161\nCuz end up happening is it\nwould get plugged into here,\n\n701\n00:37:34,161 --> 00:37:39,380\n[COUGH] and\nwe put a semicolon dash dash right there.\n\n702\n00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,190\nAnd a dash dash in SQM Microsoft SQL\nis a comment, so that means everything\n\n703\n00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:48,490\nafter that would just be ignored\nby the SQL server in the process.\n\n704\n00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,830\nI just commented out the rest of their\ncommand, whatever it was trying to do.\n\n705\n00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:57,360\nSo its another technique I can throw in\nthere to try to help my SQL become or\n\n706\n00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,120\nmy injection attack be successful.\n\n707\n00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,570\nSo, again, a lot to it.\n\n708\n00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,580\nWe're really just kinda\nscratching the surface there.\n\n709\n00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,600\nBut we don't wanna make\nthis a Transact SQL show.\n\n710\n00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,640\nAnd I know we're dying to get\ninto that wireless, as well.\n\n711\n00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,585\nSo, at least I am.\n\n712\n00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:13,350\n[LAUGH] But let's talk about,\npatching up against those.\n\n713\n00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,925\nOr protecting, I guess, against,\nTransact SQL or SQL injections.\n\n714\n00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:19,400\n[COUGH]\n>> Yeah, you know there's,\n\n715\n00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,520\nthere's a good number of tools for,\nyou know for doing this, some of the,\n\n716\n00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,400\nthe things that you use to develop web\napplications and do these SQL queries.\n\n717\n00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,640\nThey've gotten smarter at checking for\nthings and\n\n718\n00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,800\nblocking problems from happening.\n\n719\n00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,810\nStuff for\nas far as going into the operating system,\n\n720\n00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,620\nthat's another one that was mentioned.\n\n721\n00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,220\nYes, you can go in the operating system,\n\n722\n00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,490\nespecially on the SQL server side,\nthat XP command shell.\n\n723\n00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:47,090\nThere's a command, there's a command\nin the database called that,\n\n724\n00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:50,276\nthat is something that's\nbeen turned off by default.\n\n725\n00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:52,090\nI believe since SQL server what,\n2005 they turned it off.\n\n726\n00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,540\n>> I, I believe so, yes.\n\n727\n00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,740\n>> So, it's, it's,\nfrom there forwards it's been turned off.\n\n728\n00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,010\nAnd so, if someone would have to\nspecifically enable that but you know,\n\n729\n00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,470\nthat's one, that's one of another, another\nway you can get into the operating system.\n\n730\n00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,460\nYou know, so you know, learning you know,\n\n731\n00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,460\na lot of these you know,\nlearning a lot of these basics are great.\n\n732\n00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,910\nBut Mike said, the tools will help you.\n\n733\n00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:17,590\nAnd that's what they should be helping\nyou, not replacing you having know,\n\n734\n00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,600\na good working knowledge of how,\nof how this works.\n\n735\n00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,890\nA lot of the stuff that you'll see like a,\nlike, for pen testing,\n\n736\n00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:26,910\nyou know like there's the scroll\napplication plus like a whole bunch\n\n737\n00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:31,040\nof other ones will,\nyou know, analyze this code.\n\n738\n00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,150\nAnd, and look for problems.\n\n739\n00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,260\nThe plugins for Firefox which you can\ngo into, and into Firefox's store.\n\n740\n00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,710\nAnd I believe Chrome has\nthe same stuff too now.\n\n741\n00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,939\nThat you can search through their list of\napps that you can plug in the browser and\n\n742\n00:39:44,939 --> 00:39:49,387\nthey have stuff that specifically\nhelps you test for flaws in SQL and\n\n743\n00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,834\nthat may be prone to a SQL injection,\nthey will flag them, ya know so\n\n744\n00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:56,208\nthose are other great things to do.\n\n745\n00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,622\n>> Ya, exactly so\na lot of good defense there and, and\n\n746\n00:39:58,622 --> 00:40:00,542\nI know we had a question in the chatroom.\n\n747\n00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:04,036\nIf I could scroll back up and\nfind it Ben asked,\n\n748\n00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:08,090\ncan SQL be stopped by just checking for\nregular expressions?\n\n749\n00:40:09,162 --> 00:40:10,068\nSort of.\n\n750\n00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:12,530\nI mean that would,\nthat would be part of the solution,\n\n751\n00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,592\nI think is checking for those.\n\n752\n00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:17,876\nYou know, anything that we can\ndo to sanitize the user input or\n\n753\n00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:20,863\ndo the input validation is\nreally what it comes down to.\n\n754\n00:40:20,863 --> 00:40:22,766\nBecause if I'm not allowed,\nit's a username.\n\n755\n00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:27,735\nShould I be able to type an equal sign\nin a username or a password dialog box?\n\n756\n00:40:27,735 --> 00:40:32,565\nYou know, if we can look for those\ncharacters and either strip them out and\n\n757\n00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:34,415\nsubmit whatever's left.\n\n758\n00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:39,490\nOr even better, say hey, that's not\nan allowed character, type that again.\n\n759\n00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,420\nYou know, that, that goes a long way\ninto protecting against all these SQL\n\n760\n00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,890\nattacks cuz as you saw, I mean,\n\n761\n00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,790\nI need to type those type of characters\nin there to perform the SQL injection.\n\n762\n00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,870\nAlso, length is the other big thing.\n\n763\n00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,310\nIf you can limit the length\non a text field,\n\n764\n00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:56,971\nyou're gonna eliminate a good chunk\nof SQL injection attacks, as well.\n\n765\n00:40:56,971 --> 00:41:01,728\nI don't need more than 10, 15 characters\nfor a username field or a password field.\n\n766\n00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:05,510\nI mean, are your users really gonna\ncreate 20 character passwords for\n\n767\n00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,998\nyour website you're\nasking them to enroll in?\n\n768\n00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:09,065\nNo.\n>> Who doesn't?\n\n769\n00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,497\n>> I mean, they're gonna the username or\ntough password of blue, right?\n\n770\n00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:14,209\nLet's, let's be realistic there.\n\n771\n00:41:14,209 --> 00:41:18,360\nI don't need 255 characters\nin that password field.\n\n772\n00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,970\nAnd some of the more complex\nqueries that I could get into,\n\n773\n00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,910\nif I wanna start appending data returning\nentire tables and lists of passwords and\n\n774\n00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:28,830\nthings like that,\nI need a few more characters to do that.\n\n775\n00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,521\nSo by simply looking at your user's input,\nthat,\n\n776\n00:41:33,521 --> 00:41:37,790\nthat data input and removing any of those\nfunky characters, and limiting the length\n\n777\n00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:42,544\nof what they're allowed to submit,\nI eliminate most SQL injection attacks.\n\n778\n00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:43,610\nIt's that easy.\n\n779\n00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,460\nIt's just something that is not, is\noverlooked sometimes because as SQL admin,\n\n780\n00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,510\nI'm securing that SQL database.\n\n781\n00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:54,640\nYou know, I'm making sure that only that\nweb server has access to, to come back and\n\n782\n00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,980\ngrab that data and pull it back.\n\n783\n00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,870\nYou know, I'm doing everything I can to,\nto lock that thing down.\n\n784\n00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:02,070\nBut the problem is,\nis that's not where the vulnerability is.\n\n785\n00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,270\nIt's the web app.\n\n786\n00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,725\nAnd if you're developing it in-house,\n\n787\n00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:08,560\nyou've gotta make sure that\nwe're doing input validation.\n\n788\n00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,200\nIf you're buying an application,\nyou need to fuzz it.\n\n789\n00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,480\nYou need to throw these kinda things\nat it and see what it does or ask them,\n\n790\n00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,010\nyou know,\ndo they do input validation on their data.\n\n791\n00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,110\nTalk to other people that have bought or\npurchased that application and, and\n\n792\n00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,630\nsee if they've tested it.\n\n793\n00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:25,350\nBecause you're not gonna get access\nto the source code most likely if you\n\n794\n00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:26,740\npay somebody for it.\n\n795\n00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:29,635\nBut you darn sure have a right to\ntest it before you put it out there,\n\n796\n00:42:29,635 --> 00:42:30,327\nI would think.\n\n797\n00:42:30,327 --> 00:42:30,827\n>> Yeah.\n\n798\n00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:32,988\n>> And\nif we can follow those simple things,\n\n799\n00:42:32,988 --> 00:42:35,870\nwe can eliminate almost\nall of that SQL injection.\n\n800\n00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,650\nIt's really that easy.\n\n801\n00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:40,540\nAll right anything else we wanna add?\n\n802\n00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,972\nI think we've got all the questions,\n\n803\n00:42:41,972 --> 00:42:44,264\nanything else we wanna\nadd to SQL injection?\n\n804\n00:42:44,264 --> 00:42:45,627\n>> I don't think at this point.\n\n805\n00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:47,769\nI think you covered it you know,\nquite nicely.\n\n806\n00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:52,355\nAnd you know, I think there's we, we you\nknow, really talked about, you know,\n\n807\n00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:54,978\nwhat it is, the nature of it,\nand why it's a problem.\n\n808\n00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:56,801\nNow it's really kind of up to you,\nyou know?\n\n809\n00:42:56,801 --> 00:43:01,062\nYou've got, just off of here,\nyou've got what you need you know, to,\n\n810\n00:43:01,062 --> 00:43:03,185\nto assist you in passing the exam.\n\n811\n00:43:03,185 --> 00:43:06,170\nAnd you've got stuff in the in the,\nin the book, as well.\n\n812\n00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,300\nIf you have that,\nwill also kinda flush out even further.\n\n813\n00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,685\nReally, if you're gonna be serious about\ndoing this as a pen tester then yeah,\n\n814\n00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:18,265\nI, I, I would say I would agree with\nthe statements, like ITProS courses on,\n\n815\n00:43:18,265 --> 00:43:19,615\non on SQL servers.\n\n816\n00:43:19,615 --> 00:43:21,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And the SQL, you know language and\n\n817\n00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,440\nall that, how it makes it tick and all\nthat, that you should take a a look at.\n\n818\n00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,010\nYou know, so if you're gonna get,\nlike I said, if you're gonna get in,\n\n819\n00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:30,980\ndo pen testing on this,\nthat's what you need to know first.\n\n820\n00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,780\nOnce you've got that down, the, then\nit's a simple matter of just, you know,\n\n821\n00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,180\nplaying around, you know, with it.\n\n822\n00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,390\nAnd some of the tools that we had for\nweb applications yesterday you know, and\n\n823\n00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,520\nthese vulnerable servers like WebGoat.\n\n824\n00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,160\nThat one has the ability to\nlet you test that so you, but\n\n825\n00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,850\nyou've gotta learn those things\nfirst to be fluent in it.\n\n826\n00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:50,430\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n827\n00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,280\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\nthat is gonna do it for our SQL injection.\n\n828\n00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,250\nI hope you guys enjoyed the

morning, good afternoon,\nand good evening.\n\n5\n00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:37,061\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:41,120\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n7\n00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,620\nHow you doing, Sean?\n\n8\n00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,330\nI am doing just fine.\n\n9\n00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,670\n>> Good.\nWe've got an exciting episode lined up for\n\n10\n00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,250\nyou guys today.\n\n11\n00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,090\nWe are diving into chapter 15 of Shaun's\nbook, CEH study guide, version eight.\n\n12\n00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:58,253\nCertified Ethical Hacker,\nthat's what is stands for.\n\n13\n00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:02,040\n[LAUGH] chapter 15,\nwhich is our wireless chapters.\n\n14\n00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,650\nWe're going to take a look at\nhacking wireless networks.\n\n15\n00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,490\nIt's going to be a good time had by all.\n\n16\n00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,950\nSo let's get started, and\nwe're going to start off talking about,\n\n17\n00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,250\nI think,\ndifferent types of wireless networks.\n\n18\n00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,300\n>> Yeah.\nWe really need to kind of get that across.\n\n19\n00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,620\nYou know, we are talking about\nwireless networks and how to hack and\n\n20\n00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,710\neverything here.\n\n21\n00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,970\nWe need to talk about where they are where\nyou them and the different deployment\n\n22\n00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,120\nscenarios that you have because yes that\nis gonna affect your ability to pen test\n\n23\n00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,555\na you know wireless networks so before\nwe get into the good stuff, we kind of\n\n24\n00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:40,625\nhave to get a little appetizer\nout of the way here.\n\n25\n00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,545\nIs it that close to lunch?\n\n26\n00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:44,315\n>> We're all hungry here at ITPRO TV now.\n\n27\n00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:47,575\nLet's get that appetizer rolling.\n\n28\n00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:51,630\n>> So we know that wireless\nnetworks are very common.\n\n29\n00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,600\nNowadays, and they're getting to be\nmore and more common each and every day.\n\n30\n00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,910\nYou've already mentioned,\nwas it your cable provider this area,\n\n31\n00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,030\nwhoever it is, is doing it?\n\n32\n00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,910\n>> Yes, you see it in a lot of these\nbig cable service providers now\n\n33\n00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,050\ngiving you this new option where\nyou used to buy the cable modem,\n\n34\n00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:11,130\nyou provided your own router and WiFi\naccess point or wireless access point.\n\n35\n00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,570\nAnd now you can go down there and\nthey'll say hey look,\n\n36\n00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,820\nwe've got a modem with\na built in access point.\n\n37\n00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,380\nYou're like great, one less device that\nI've got to hook up on my network.\n\n38\n00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,850\nThat sounds fantastic\nuntil you get it home and\n\n39\n00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,930\nrealize the reason they're doing it is not\nonly does it give you an access point but\n\n40\n00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,640\nit creates a public access point for\nany of the ISP's customers so\n\n41\n00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,820\nmy neighbor can now see this\naccess point if he clicks on it.\n\n42\n00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,890\nIt's secured but all he has to do is type\nin his cox communications user ID and\n\n43\n00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,810\npassword and he can now connect\nthrough my wireless access point.\n\n44\n00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,230\nNow it is segregated\nout from my network but\n\n45\n00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:48,900\nkind of makes me nervous being that close\nright, on the same piece of equipment.\n\n46\n00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,580\n>> Would me.\n\n47\n00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,260\n>> I mean, okay, now they've got access\nto the same piece of hardware and\n\n48\n00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,470\nI'm sure there's going to be\n>> Some vulnerabilities found in that that\n\n49\n00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,310\nthere's going to allow access\nto my network, so, not good.\n\n50\n00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,580\nBut, as you said,\nwireless is just everywhere.\n\n51\n00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,070\nI mean,\nMcDonald's has their own free WiFi, or,\n\n52\n00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,760\nI don't know if it's free or\nnot, but, it's everywhere.\n\n53\n00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,322\n>> Everything's free if\nyou know how to do it.\n\n54\n00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,030\n>> [LAUGH] For Sean, everything is free.\n\n55\n00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,960\nThis is true.\n\n56\n00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,860\n>> All right.\nWe need to cut that out in post.\n\n57\n00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,600\nJust get rid of that.\n\n58\n00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,268\nSo [LAUGH] right?\n\n59\n00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:20,795\n>> [LAUGH] We'll purge that later on.\n\n60\n00:03:20,795 --> 00:03:24,060\n[LAUGH]\nOh, so you know,\n\n61\n00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,140\nso we're looking at wireless and\nwe know that they're everywhere.\n\n62\n00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,540\nBut there are different types of wireless\nthat we need to be familiar with you\n\n63\n00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:38,910\nknow like bar F or, our normal thing when\nwe think of wireless we always think\n\n64\n00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:44,180\nyou know the U02.11 standards the a the b\nthe g the n, the ac that's coming out.\n\n65\n00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,300\nApple also need to consider things like,\nbluetooth is another wireless\n\n66\n00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,460\nrf technology that operates\nat that 2.4 range.\n\n67\n00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,400\n>> Yes it does.\n\n68\n00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,630\n>> So we got a few different things.\n\n69\n00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,680\nSo when we talk about networks,\nwhat do we need to be familiar with John?\n\n70\n00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,670\nWell first of all we'll talk about\nthe ways people deploy wireless networks.\n\n71\n00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,110\nAnd you've already\ntouched on some of them.\n\n72\n00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,980\nWe have the public hotspots.\n\n73\n00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,000\nHotspots period.\n\n74\n00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,570\nHotspots don't necessarily\nhave to be public.\n\n75\n00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,830\nThey typically are associated with that.\n\n76\n00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,410\nBut they don't have to be, think about\nall of the places you see hotspots.\n\n77\n00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,190\nThey're in restaurants.\n\n78\n00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,260\nThey're in hotels.\n\n79\n00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,400\nThey're in train centers\nlike we have next door here.\n\n80\n00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,660\nWe've got all sorts of things.\n\n81\n00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,560\nThen they got them in aircraft.\n\n82\n00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,410\nYou know, when you're flying they put them\nthere and people expect to have them.\n\n83\n00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:33,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know.\n\n84\n00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,250\nAnd then, heck, I actually saw when\nI was in Hawaii a couple weeks ago,\n\n85\n00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,770\nbelieve it or not,\nthey actually got WiFi on the beach.\n\n86\n00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,370\n>> On the beach.\n>> Yeah.\n\n87\n00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,400\n>> Isn't that amazing.\n\n88\n00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,610\nNow see I've always looked at those\nsilly commercials for some of those\n\n89\n00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,060\ndifferent credit card companies, where's\nthe guy's on the beach and he's like oh,\n\n90\n00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,730\nyou can do your tax return from here, or\nyou can check your credit card balances\n\n91\n00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,260\nwhile you're walking\ndown the beach in Hawaii.\n\n92\n00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:58,400\nThere's no buildings anywhere near you,\nyou're out in the middle of nowhere.\n\n93\n00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,970\nI'm like, really?\n\n94\n00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,090\nThey do.\n\n95\n00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,060\n>> And let me just say something.\n\n96\n00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,980\nYeah, the only reason I knew that\nis cause I cellphone picked it up.\n\n97\n00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,040\nAnd I was like really.\n\n98\n00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,540\n>> So.\n>> Yeah.\n\n99\n00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,760\n>> There you are on the beach in Hawaii.\n\n100\n00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,050\n>> Yeah, there's no way I'm going to\n\n101\n00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,175\nbe able to be on Waikiki like\nlet me browse my Facebook page.\n\n102\n00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:16,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I'll send you pictures later.\n\n103\n00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,830\nYou want to see what Waikiki\nlooks right now, you come over.\n\n104\n00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,470\n>> Exactly.\n\n105\n00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,490\n>> I'm not, not going to do it.\n\n106\n00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,550\nBut yeah there were people\nthere with their tablets and\n\n107\n00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,548\nstuff like that going dude it's like what?\n\n108\n00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:27,020\nYou know.\n\n109\n00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,860\n>> Better thing to look at when I'm on\nthe beach than my darn phone right?\n\n110\n00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,975\n>> Yeah there's a lot betters to\nlook on the beach let me just say.\n\n111\n00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,800\n[LAUGH] So, we see it everywhere.\n\n112\n00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,820\nI mean, and you guys are saying, I'm\ndriving in my car, you know, and you're\n\n113\n00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,850\nat a red light because I would never\ntext or do anything when I'm driving.\n\n114\n00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,070\nAnd you know, my phone popped up,\ngot it set to, you know, look for\n\n115\n00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,960\nnetworks and pops up and says, hey,\ndo you want to connect to this network?\n\n116\n00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,190\nI mean, they're everywhere.\n\n117\n00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,870\nEverywhere you go.\n\n118\n00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:56,740\nAnd that wasn't the case a few years ago,\nI mean it's recently exploded.\n\n119\n00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,410\nI think part of that is because maybe the\nstainers have gotten a little bit better,\n\n120\n00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,030\na little more secure, and\nlike you said, people just expect it.\n\n121\n00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,090\nIf I go somewhere and\n\n122\n00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,660\nthey don't have a wireless network\navailable, I'm really disappointed.\n\n123\n00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,280\nYeah, people literally do expect that,\nand that's something to,\n\n124\n00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,250\nit's a great point, because it's something\nthat we can use against them later on.\n\n125\n00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:27,820\nPeople expect that no matter where they go\nto be able to turn on a wireless device\n\n126\n00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,596\nand be able to find WiFi.\n\n127\n00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:32,560\nThat works to, as a pen tester.\n\n128\n00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,880\nThat works to my advantage.\n\n129\n00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,340\nAs a hacker, that works to my advantage.\n\n130\n00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,090\nIf you want to look at it that way too.\n\n131\n00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:43,600\nAnd so they are everywhere and\nthe public has been trained to expect that\n\n132\n00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,290\nthey've been conditioned to expect that.\n\n133\n00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,640\nSo yeah,\nit's something that can work for us.\n\n134\n00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,120\nBut in addition to hotspots\nwe have other things.\n\n135\n00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,570\nHotspots are the common buzzword.\n\n136\n00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,000\nYou can create them anywhere.\n\n137\n00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,210\nYou can create them from a notebook.\n\n138\n00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,260\nYou can create them from a tablet,\ncreate them on a cellphone.\n\n139\n00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,250\nYou can even get the portable cellphones\nfrom people like Virgin Mobile and\n\n140\n00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,390\nVerizon and Sprint.\n\n141\n00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,650\nThey all have them.\n\n142\n00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,660\n>> Your car now, right?\n\n143\n00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,160\nI mean some of these cars that\nare coming out are hotspots.\n\n144\n00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,370\nSo you could use it to create a hotspot.\n\n145\n00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,120\nImpressive stuff.\n\n146\n00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,630\n>> Yeah.\n\n147\n00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,140\nThat was a fascinating one too.\n\n148\n00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,250\nThey start putting those in cars.\n\n149\n00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:17,955\nOkay.\n>> Really?\n\n150\n00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:19,380\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's like, you don't need it.\n\n151\n00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,470\nAll right?\n\n152\n00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,120\nYou really don't.\n\n153\n00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,210\nBut other implementations that we have,\n\n154\n00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,220\none of the things we see with\na wireless networks a lot is they are,\n\n155\n00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,290\nin fact where they started and\nthey're still very dominant.\n\n156\n00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,330\nIs there extensions to wired networks,\nyou know,\n\n157\n00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,000\ncause they originally started coming\nout as ways to extend your network in\n\n158\n00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,710\nthe places where it was impractical or\nimpossible to put wires.\n\n159\n00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,042\nYou couldn't takes wires, for example,\nif you wanted to have scanners or\n\n160\n00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:51,601\nsomething or computers in your warehouse.\n\n161\n00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:56,303\nWhere your manufacturing floor, it may\nnot be the best to run cables out there.\n\n162\n00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:59,845\nI mean some cases you might have to you\nknow with all the interference you might\n\n163\n00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,330\ndefinitely have to run cables.\n\n164\n00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,181\nBut if you could get away with not\ndoing it then why not do that?\n\n165\n00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:06,843\n>> Absolutely.\n\n166\n00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:09,352\n>> And so,\nthat started a whole revolution with\n\n167\n00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:13,248\nthat allowing people to be much more\nmobile and take their computer and\n\n168\n00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:16,240\nmove from location to\nlocation was a huge thing.\n\n169\n00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,176\nAnd of course, then, the homes picked\nit up to for the exact same reason.\n\n170\n00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:22,421\nAfter the businesses had it for\na while then the price came down and\n\n171\n00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,849\nit became more efficient,\nmore standardized.\n\n172\n00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:30,405\nThen, the home users had it when\nthey were installing access points\n\n173\n00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:37,380\nin there own house and being able to do\nall sorts of interesting things with that.\n\n174\n00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,660\nHow many people nowadays do you\nsee that actually have full on\n\n175\n00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,820\nwired network in their house?\n\n176\n00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,560\nThey exist.\n\n177\n00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,465\nI've got a wired network in my house, but\nI also have a lot of wireless going too.\n\n178\n00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,710\n>> Yeah, you see, another example, like\nGainesville and I'm sure many towns across\n\n179\n00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,716\nthe country and around the world\nare probably doing something very similar.\n\n180\n00:08:59,716 --> 00:09:03,900\nThe big fad now is to go downtown,\nto rejuvenate downtown, so\n\n181\n00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,460\nbusinesses are moving into these\nolder buildings and setting up shop.\n\n182\n00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:10,100\nLawyers office, dentists office,\nthings like that.\n\n183\n00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900\nAnd some of these\nare historical buildings,\n\n184\n00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:15,960\nso being able to cut a hole in\nthe wall and start running wires and\n\n185\n00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,930\npatch panels and things like that\nis just not gonna be allowed.\n\n186\n00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,910\nThe historical people who are there\nthat control it are gonna say, no,\n\n187\n00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,040\nyou can't do that.\n\n188\n00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,582\nSo, our only option is to go wireless.\n\n189\n00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:30,160\nAnd so, you see a lot of that as well.\n\n190\n00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,770\nSo, they are pretty much everywhere.\n\n191\n00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,310\nYou guys know from your own\nexperience either from work, or\n\n192\n00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,280\nif you live in an apartment complex and\nyou open up your phone,\n\n193\n00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,920\nyou're gonna see 30 different\nwireless networks listed there.\n\n194\n00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,570\nEveryone of your neighbors is gonna\nhave a wireless access point.\n\n195\n00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,750\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n196\n00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,760\n>> You see it all over the place.\n\n197\n00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,900\n>> Yeah, a fun fact by the way,\nGainesville's so\n\n198\n00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,328\nsmall, one hotspot whole town.\n\n199\n00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:56,395\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I found it, I was surprised too, but.\n\n200\n00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,270\n>> [LAUGH] Whose got our digital downtown.\n\n201\n00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,990\nTheir slowly expanding that out,\n\n202\n00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,905\nright now it covers about two\ncity blocks downtown [LAUGH].\n\n203\n00:10:02,905 --> 00:10:05,465\nWere getting there.\n\n204\n00:10:05,465 --> 00:10:06,544\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n205\n00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:10,477\n>> And if Cox has their way, their gonna\nturn the whole town into a dang hotspot\n\n206\n00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:14,868\nwith all these modem slash access point\ncombination, so we'll see how that goes.\n\n207\n00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:15,791\nI know I got rid of mine.\n\n208\n00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:18,658\nI take it back, it's like no,\nI don't need this [CROSSTALK].\n\n209\n00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:19,987\n>> I agree with you there.\n\n210\n00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,571\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> There's no page on there where I can\n\n211\n00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:26,590\ndisable that half of it,\nthat's when it goes back to cocks.\n\n212\n00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:31,545\n>> Yeah, I'm right with you on that one\n>> Yeah.\n\n213\n00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:34,928\n>> And just to mention some other\nimplementations we have of it.\n\n214\n00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:39,926\nWe have the extension of wired networks,\nit's common to see mesh networks now\n\n215\n00:10:39,926 --> 00:10:44,999\nwith wireless, so you have a bunch of\nwireless access points covering an area,\n\n216\n00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:49,950\nand people can hop back and forth from\none to one and really not even notice it.\n\n217\n00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,190\nIt can be completely transparent.\n\n218\n00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,790\nAnd then, one more on top of all that\nis what we call our site to site.\n\n219\n00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,260\nAnd that's been a huge thing as well.\n\n220\n00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,340\nBeing able to extend wireless\nto other facilities that you own\n\n221\n00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,300\nwithout having to do a lot of digging and\nstuff like that to install cables.\n\n222\n00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,840\nA case in point with that, just to kinda\nillustrate what we're talking about here,\n\n223\n00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,830\na client that I worked with in Napa\nValley, it's a wine region in California,\n\n224\n00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,260\nthey had an ordering of their\nadministrative offices on\n\n225\n00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,720\none side of the street and they had\ntheir warehouse on the other side.\n\n226\n00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,960\nAnd they had a choice,\nthey wanted to link the two.\n\n227\n00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,120\nIt makes sense.\n\n228\n00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,730\nSomeone goes in the ordering part,\nthey put everything through and\n\n229\n00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,410\nthen they couldn't bring the wine\nin from across the street.\n\n230\n00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,490\nWell, the problem with it was\nthat they want to link these two.\n\n231\n00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,255\nThey had a choice, they originally said,\nhey, let's go the old school way.\n\n232\n00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,890\nLet's run a cable across the street.\n\n233\n00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,250\nWell, they can't run a cable through\nthe air because there was a lot of semis\n\n234\n00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,340\ngoing through there because there\nwere warehouses on that street.\n\n235\n00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,650\nThe only other option to run that\ncable would be to go under the street.\n\n236\n00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:02,490\nThe City of Napa said, yeah, you can\ndo that, but if you're gonna do that,\n\n237\n00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,060\nyou have to pay the fees to tear it up,\nyou have to worry about diverting traffic,\n\n238\n00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,925\nyou have to get okay\nfrom all your neighbors.\n\n239\n00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:09,695\nYou gotta do all these things.\n\n240\n00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,235\nAnd it was gonna cost them to run a cable.\n\n241\n00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:15,325\nIt was gonna cost them high\nsix figures to do that.\n\n242\n00:12:15,325 --> 00:12:18,245\n>> A few hundred yards and\nthey're going up in a high six figures to\n\n243\n00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:21,665\nconnect these two buildings, so probably\nnot the most efficient or the best option.\n\n244\n00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:23,325\n>> Yeah, it's not desirable.\n\n245\n00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,720\nYou're talking a lot of money\nto put down just for that.\n\n246\n00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,210\nAnd so, why they might have had to\ndo something like that years ago,\n\n247\n00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:34,578\nwhat they did is they decided,\nwell, we're gonna put an antenna\n\n248\n00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:37,657\non top of our building,\nan antenna on top of the warehouse.\n\n249\n00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:41,185\nAnd that way, we can just beam a signal\nback and forth and connect the two and\n\n250\n00:12:41,185 --> 00:12:43,369\nnot have to worry about\ndigging up the street,\n\n251\n00:12:43,369 --> 00:12:46,337\nwe don't have to worry about a cable\ngetting snagged on a semi or\n\n252\n00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:49,866\nanything cuz it's gonna be up above\nthat even that line, and we're done.\n\n253\n00:12:49,866 --> 00:12:54,481\nAnd it was a cheap and\neffective solution to something that's\n\n254\n00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:58,310\nonly capable with doing\nsomething like wireless.\n\n255\n00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,520\n>> Right.\n\n256\n00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,231\nSo, now,\nthey've got their two buildings connected,\n\n257\n00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:06,071\ndidn't have to tear up a road and all they\nhave to do is decide what technology they\n\n258\n00:13:06,071 --> 00:13:08,117\nwanna use to connect those two buildings.\n\n259\n00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:11,780\nWiFi is definitely the way to go or\nwireless in general is the way to go.\n\n260\n00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,317\nAnd we can decide; we've got\na few different choices that\n\n261\n00:13:14,317 --> 00:13:16,301\nwe could use to connect\nthose two buildings.\n\n262\n00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:16,851\n>> Yeah.\n\n263\n00:13:16,851 --> 00:13:21,930\nWireless has opened up a lot of things\nthat we weren't able to do before,\n\n264\n00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:24,272\nor at least, not do the same way.\n\n265\n00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:29,900\nWe had to actually find all sorts\nof little deals to pull things off.\n\n266\n00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,670\nWe had to find ways to put running cables.\n\n267\n00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,580\nWho knows?\n\n268\n00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,970\nMaybe, the cable was out of their budget.\n\n269\n00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,300\nMaybe, they would have had to\ndo dial-up across the street.\n\n270\n00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,410\nI mean, it's conceivable they\nwould have had to do that.\n\n271\n00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,940\nWith wireless, no,\nthey don't have to do that.\n\n272\n00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:49,070\nThey can link these things pretty easily,\nand they can link them for some too.\n\n273\n00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,744\n>> Yeah, absolutely, we can get pretty\nfar, especially if we've got some kind of\n\n274\n00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:55,674\nparabolic antenna that can really\nfocus the energy and beam it.\n\n275\n00:13:55,674 --> 00:14:00,162\nWe can even go as up to microwave if we're\ntalking about a metropolitan area network\n\n276\n00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:03,960\nor something like that, where I've\ngot some longer distances to go.\n\n277\n00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,070\nSo, a lot of options there.\n\n278\n00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,660\nAnd so,\n\n279\n00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,485\nas Sean points out, there's several\ndifferent types of wireless out there.\n\n280\n00:14:09,485 --> 00:14:12,765\nSometimes, we get stuck on, I'm just\nthinking about our home network or\n\n281\n00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:13,693\na simple office network.\n\n282\n00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:18,235\nBut wireless is implemented\nin many different formats,\n\n283\n00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,290\ndepending on what the situation requires.\n\n284\n00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,118\nWell, then, each one of those might\nrequire a little bit different technique\n\n285\n00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:25,457\nto test it and to attack it.\n\n286\n00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,220\n>> Absolutely.\n\n287\n00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,890\nThere's so many possibilities.\n\n288\n00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,740\nIt's a big thing.\n\n289\n00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,227\n>> All right.\n\n290\n00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,107\nSo, we've got our types\nof wireless networks.\n\n291\n00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,085\nWhat about the wireless standards?\n\n292\n00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,220\n>> Yes, there are.\n\n293\n00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,330\nThere is a family of wireless standards,\n\n294\n00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:47,700\nthere's a whole alphabet\nsoup going around this.\n\n295\n00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,030\n>> Right.\n>> There's the 802.11 standards,\n\n296\n00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,850\nthere's the parent 802.11 standard.\n\n297\n00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,879\nTechnically the IEEE 802.11, but I'm not\ngonna keep Repeating a IEEE cuz I'm lazy.\n\n298\n00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,990\nThe 802.11 was the original\nparent standard, and\n\n299\n00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,646\nthat actually came out in the 90s,\nbut it never was popular.\n\n300\n00:15:09,646 --> 00:15:14,551\nWe're talking very slow speed\neven by the standards then.\n\n301\n00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:16,879\n>> Wasn't it one megabit per second or\nsomething like that?\n\n302\n00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,340\n>> One to three if you were lucky.\n\n303\n00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,110\n>> Yeah.\n\n304\n00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:24,120\n>> It was somewhere in there and on top\nof the equipment was proprietary and\n\n305\n00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,280\nit was expensive, so you were getting you\nweren't getting a lot for the investment.\n\n306\n00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,995\nSo, it was pretty much a rare Bs to C,\n\n307\n00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:36,535\nsome businesses used it for\nvery specific reasons.\n\n308\n00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,597\nBut it would be fine if you had\nsomeone using like a wireless\n\n309\n00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:43,798\nscanner in a warehouse, going [SOUND] in\narranged bar codes and stuff like that.\n\n310\n00:15:43,798 --> 00:15:46,861\nThat doesn't send a lot of data,\nso that would probably work, and\n\n311\n00:15:46,861 --> 00:15:49,062\nthat would be a reasonable application for\nit.\n\n312\n00:15:49,062 --> 00:15:50,715\nBut that's about it.\n\n313\n00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:57,472\nIf you sent large data, it would be like\ndial up without wires is what it would be.\n\n314\n00:15:57,472 --> 00:16:02,745\nSo that never really caught on and\nlike I said proprietary equipment\n\n315\n00:16:02,745 --> 00:16:09,650\nIt wasn't until 802.11b came out, that\nthe public really caught on with this.\n\n316\n00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,760\nThat they brought that out and the public,\nthat's when your commercial and\n\n317\n00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,070\nyour consumer grade routers came out,\nand it became really popular.\n\n318\n00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,170\nYou got the small Linksys, D-Link and\n\n319\n00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:26,560\nother routers like that,\nthat people would easily plug in and use.\n\n320\n00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:33,270\nYou know, so,\n211B is 2.4 gigahurtz transmission and\n\n321\n00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:38,400\nit has a speed of,\na theoretical speed of 11 megabits.\n\n322\n00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,980\n>> Theoretically.\n>> You ain't getting that,\n\n323\n00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,350\nyou're just not.\n\n324\n00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:49,020\nYou know, so, none of the speeds that\nyou're gonna see posted on a box.\n\n325\n00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,580\nOf a wireless device.\n\n326\n00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,430\nYou're never going to get those.\n\n327\n00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:56,160\n>> They test this stuff out in the middle\nof the ocean with no obstructions\n\n328\n00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,120\nwhatsoever, a completely flat surface.\n\n329\n00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,308\nThey can say look, see, this is the speed\nwe get and this is the distance we get.\n\n330\n00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:05,550\nI'm teasing, but.\n\n331\n00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,290\nThe theoretical limits are just that,\nand then we gotta subtract for\n\n332\n00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,730\nobstructions and attenuations of\nthe signal and things like that.\n\n333\n00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,870\n>> Atmosphere conditions,\neverything just fits into it.\n\n334\n00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,890\nYeah, they actually test these things\nin I believe what they call is anechoic\n\n335\n00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,570\nchamber, it's all radio-dampened and\neverything inside of it, so it's a.\n\n336\n00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,600\nFaraday cage on steroids is\nwhat it comes down to, and so\n\n337\n00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,000\nit's the same type of rooms that they test\nlike radar systems and stuff like that for\n\n338\n00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,220\nthe military to see what's going\non with it and things like that.\n\n339\n00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,430\nSo, that's what they test it in.\n\n340\n00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,010\nYou're not gonna get those conditions\noutside of that environment.\n\n341\n00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,510\nSo that's the theoretical stuff.\n\n342\n00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,780\nNow, you're not, you're just not,\nyou're probably on a you're gonna get 6\n\n343\n00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,730\nto 7 MB if you're lucky, you'll get about,\nlike I said you'll get about half that.\n\n344\n00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,820\nAnd we had B was the first on that,\n\n345\n00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,730\nit was the first one that\nthe public really adopted.\n\n346\n00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,450\nIt has pretty decent range.\n\n347\n00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,140\nIt goes through walls and\nstuff like that, for the most part.\n\n348\n00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,520\nWe're not talking about any exotic\nconstruction or anything like that.\n\n349\n00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,890\nIt will go through most building\nmaterial stuff like that.\n\n350\n00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,570\nWith some, it would retard the signal\na bit but not a lot, typically.\n\n351\n00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,980\nNow, the other standard we\nhad came out was 802.11a.\n\n352\n00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,198\nWhich sounds like just B, you said B came\nout first, A's first in the alphabet.\n\n353\n00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:26,019\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n354\n00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:27,120\n>> What happened?\n\n355\n00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,080\nThey, A went to committee\nfirst to be approved,\n\n356\n00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,400\nB went to committee after A,\nafter A started its process.\n\n357\n00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,390\nBut B got through committee before\nA got through committee to be approved.\n\n358\n00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,830\nSo B became the dominant\nstandard at that time.\n\n359\n00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,480\n>> That's right, yeah.\n\n360\n00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,150\nThe B working group paid the guys a little\nmore money to speed their stuff through.\n\n361\n00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:45,877\nNo, [LAUGH].\n\n362\n00:18:45,877 --> 00:18:47,460\nThe IEEE-\n>> They actually paid the A group to\n\n363\n00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,290\nslow them down.\n\n364\n00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,220\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n365\n00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:52,030\nThe IEEE breaks up into those\ndifferent working groups, right?\n\n366\n00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,160\nThe different projects and it just so\n\n367\n00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,930\nhappens that that project kind of finished\nthe process a little bit faster so\n\n368\n00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,950\nb actually comes out before\na which is kind of odd.\n\n369\n00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,100\nAnd some of em you never even see I mean\nthey get folded into other projects and\n\n370\n00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,690\nthings like that.\n\n371\n00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,252\nSo I don't think there\never was an 802.11C.\n\n372\n00:19:09,252 --> 00:19:10,080\nThere was.\n\n373\n00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,810\n>> Yeah it was.\n>> I'm sure\n\n374\n00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,100\nthere was a group that worked\non something if it gets.\n\n375\n00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,660\n>> Yeah.\n>> And you can go look up the standard\n\n376\n00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,210\n802 one c but\nit's not something you see on that.\n\n377\n00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,040\n>> Yeah there was one but\nI forget what it pertains to.\n\n378\n00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,820\nBut you're right.\n\n379\n00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,790\n>> Yeah.\n>> You know that's a common thing is\n\n380\n00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,180\nthat you and this brings up something\nthat we're gonna see later.\n\n381\n00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,230\nIs that we hear the term,\nlike the one that is,\n\n382\n00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,372\nit does come into play when we're\ntalking about wireless 802.11i.\n\n383\n00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,890\nYou will not buy 802.11i access point.\n\n384\n00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,190\nIt just doesn't exist.\n\n385\n00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,410\nYou'll buy an access point\nthat supports 802.11i.\n\n386\n00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,020\nBecause ATA 11i all out\ndeals with the security.\n\n387\n00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,360\n>> Right.\n>> It doesn't specify radio signaling or\n\n388\n00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,030\nanything like that.\n\n389\n00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,130\nSo it's folded into something else, so\n\n390\n00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,390\nyeah it's exactly right\nthe way a lot of these work.\n\n391\n00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,610\n>> So A came out and.\n\n392\n00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:56,522\nLittle bit faster.\n\n393\n00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:59,528\nA different frequency\n[CROSSTALK] we're seeing.\n\n394\n00:19:59,528 --> 00:20:03,117\n>> Yeah 802.11a is 5 gigahertz and\n\n395\n00:20:03,117 --> 00:20:07,476\nyou're getting about 54 megabits in speed.\n\n396\n00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:09,550\nAgain, same rules apply before.\n\n397\n00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:13,220\nYou're probably not ever going\nto get 54 megabits, but.\n\n398\n00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,910\nYou may get a little more then half\nof that and there's a reason for\n\n399\n00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:22,150\nthat is because five gigahertz is\na less a you know a lot say polluted or\n\n400\n00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,870\nbusy part of the frequency band 2.4\nis in the ISM band, industrial,\n\n401\n00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,540\nscientific and medical, and\nyou can use that without having a license.\n\n402\n00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:38,470\nIt's an unlicensed band, so you can use\nthat, your devices can transmit on that,\n\n403\n00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,730\nbut anybody that's ever seen a wireless,\nif you flip it over or\n\n404\n00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:45,030\nlook at the packaging or whatever,\nyou'll see something in there that says.\n\n405\n00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:50,640\nThis device cannot give out any signals\nthat interfere with other devices.\n\n406\n00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,490\nAnd it has to accept\ninterference that it receives.\n\n407\n00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,500\n>> Right.\n>> It'll say that right off the bat.\n\n408\n00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,870\nSo they're basically saying\ndon't mess with anyone else and\n\n409\n00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,605\ndon't complain when\nanyone messes with you.\n\n410\n00:21:03,605 --> 00:21:04,120\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n411\n00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,830\n>> So a lot of people use this\n\n412\n00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,170\n>> You use the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum,\n\n413\n00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:17,960\neverything from game controllers\nto bluetooth uses that.\n\n414\n00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,015\nMicrowaves can actually put out\nsignals in 2.4 range, cordless phones.\n\n415\n00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:23,465\nPhones will do it.\n\n416\n00:21:23,465 --> 00:21:24,365\n>> Right.\nAnother big one.\n\n417\n00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:28,975\n>> So there's a lot of them that\ncan cause interference in 2.4.\n\n418\n00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:30,965\nSo all of these things competing for\n\n419\n00:21:30,965 --> 00:21:36,110\nthat means that there's more interference\ntherefore the bandwidth starts to go down.\n\n420\n00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,410\nAnd the connection gets a little shoddy.\n\n421\n00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:41,240\nOn the five gigahertz one,\nyou have to license that one.\n\n422\n00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,600\nSo, when you have to license that one and\nthere's not as many people in it,\n\n423\n00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,120\nyou're gonna get better speeds.\n\n424\n00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,820\nIt's less crowded, less polluted.\n\n425\n00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,390\nThere are things in there.\n\n426\n00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,270\nBut, it's not as many as 2.4.\n\n427\n00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,770\n>> Right.\n\n428\n00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,030\n>> So, therefore, A just worked better.\n\n429\n00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,190\nBut, you pay for that,\n>> Yeah, you do.\n\n430\n00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,600\n>> You pay for it somehow.\n\n431\n00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,250\nIt's like, great,\nyou buy an access point that's 802 11A.\n\n432\n00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,990\nThe downside of it is is where B will go\nthrough walls and all that pretty readily.\n\n433\n00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,960\nA hits those things, and\nbecause of the magic of RF.\n\n434\n00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,910\nIt hits those same walls and\n\n435\n00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,490\nthey get slowed down to a much\nhigher degree than V does.\n\n436\n00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,680\nIt has to do with the modulation,\nthe signal and all that.\n\n437\n00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,770\nThat does that.\n\n438\n00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,840\nSo.\n\n439\n00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,600\n>> If you think about it.\n\n440\n00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,640\nIt's frequency right?\n\n441\n00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,440\nFrequency being the number\nof cycles per second.\n\n442\n00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,180\nIt measured in hertz.\n\n443\n00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,640\nFive gigahertz is a lot faster so\nyou can imagine a much more wavy pattern.\n\n444\n00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,000\nWhereas 2.4, and I'm exaggerating but\n2.4 is gonna be a much slower\n\n445\n00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,040\nwave that's a less frequency\noccurring per cycle or per second.\n\n446\n00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,350\nAnd it's like sound.\n\n447\n00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,740\nYou guys are familiar with the fact that\nbass carries a lot further than treble.\n\n448\n00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,060\nSame thing, same principle.\n\n449\n00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,980\nThose longer wavelengths.\n\n450\n00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,130\nAre able to go through obstacles a little\nbit easier, so they go a little further.\n\n451\n00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,480\nWhereas those higher frequencies\nattenuate a lot quicker.\n\n452\n00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,090\nThey're faster,\nthey can carry a little more data.\n\n453\n00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,320\nBut they attenuate faster because they\nneed a lot of energy to keep up that\n\n454\n00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,140\nfrequency.\n\n455\n00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,970\nSo you can imagine kicking\nout the same amount of power.\n\n456\n00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,780\nBut that power doing that high frequency,\nit eats up a lot of the energy by having\n\n457\n00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:24,780\nto do so many, that rapid frequency,\nso you're gonna get a much slower,\n\n458\n00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,540\njust slow down to what, like,\n60 feet on A if I remember correctly?\n\n459\n00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,180\n>> Yeah, you start seeing a hit over.\n\n460\n00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,210\nIt wasn't that great of a distance.\n\n461\n00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,130\nIt didn't take much.\n\n462\n00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,630\nBut the way that I kinda look at it was\nand you should also be aware of this.\n\n463\n00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,610\nIs I think there is, I know there is\na definite security benefit to that.\n\n464\n00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:46,190\nIt sounds like initially\nit's like oh boo hoo.\n\n465\n00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:46,920\nDoesn't go as far.\n\n466\n00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,420\nGet B.\n\n467\n00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:54,062\nIf I wanna cover a conference\nroom with wireless and that's it.\n\n468\n00:23:54,062 --> 00:23:58,173\nA is probably a good choice for that cause\nits gonna stay in that conference room and\n\n469\n00:23:58,173 --> 00:24:01,569\nonce it hits the walls It's gonna\nstart slowing down pretty quick,\n\n470\n00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:02,839\nit will not get that far.\n\n471\n00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:05,942\nSo, it becomes a little tougher or\n\n472\n00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:11,723\neven a lot tougher to compromise\nover a 802.11 B network.\n\n473\n00:24:11,723 --> 00:24:12,421\n>> Absolutely.\n\n474\n00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:15,513\nActually, when we talk about\nsetting up a wireless network,\n\n475\n00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:17,910\nwe're always worried about our coverage.\n\n476\n00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,280\nWe do our wireless surveys to\nmake sure that we're not covering\n\n477\n00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,950\nthe office building next to us or the\nparking lot or places where people might\n\n478\n00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,755\nbe able to sit unnoticed and try to\nconnect to my network and do bad things.\n\n479\n00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:31,150\nSo, there's time when I'm\nnot worried about there.\n\n480\n00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,872\nIn fact, I'd rather have that shorter\nrange than to have this 300-foot\n\n481\n00:24:35,872 --> 00:24:39,135\ncoverage that I might\nget from that 802.11 B.\n\n482\n00:24:39,135 --> 00:24:40,840\n>> Yeah, and\nsome of the commercial access points,\n\n483\n00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,959\nyou actually gotta adjust the power and\nrange on them as well.\n\n484\n00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:48,680\nThat is something else that's worth\nthrowing into this, in fact you can even\n\n485\n00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:54,400\ndo some upgrades and some hacks to things\nlike Linksys and buffalo routers and\n\n486\n00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,357\nstuff like that to make it so\ntheir arranging power's different.\n\n487\n00:24:59,357 --> 00:25:01,829\nI have one at home,\nI can crank the power up and\n\n488\n00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:04,639\nI can probably cook an egg\nin a neighbor's fridge.\n\n489\n00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,330\nOr I can turn it down where you have\n\n490\n00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,350\nto be within ten feet of that\naccess point to actually see it.\n\n491\n00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,340\n>> Right, and keep in mind here the US and\n\n492\n00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,790\nI know that there's other governing\nbodies out there around the world.\n\n493\n00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,775\nHere, we've got the good old\nFCC that everybody loves.\n\n494\n00:25:20,775 --> 00:25:24,941\nAnd they control, they're the ones that\nset the regulations, and as Shaun said,\n\n495\n00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,632\nwe're not supposed to have a device\nthat interferes with other devices,\n\n496\n00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:31,800\nother wireless devices that\nmight be in use in the area.\n\n497\n00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,150\nSo, they control that power, and so\n\n498\n00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:37,611\nturning it down may be really good for\ntweaking your site survey to make\n\n499\n00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:39,920\nsure you're not covering\nplaces you don't wanna cover.\n\n500\n00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,420\nTurning it up could very well\nviolate some regulations.\n\n501\n00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,050\nSo, do make sure you\npay attention to that.\n\n502\n00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,360\n>> That's a very, very good point.\n\n503\n00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,494\nA prime example of that is to\ncheck the local laws and all that,\n\n504\n00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:58,240\non how it pertains to wireless.\n\n505\n00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,420\nFCC's got rules here, but\nif you go to Europe for example.\n\n506\n00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:08,760\nWe can only use channels one\nthrough 11 here for 2.4.\n\n507\n00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,020\nIn Europe, they can use onr through 14.\n\n508\n00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:17,370\nYou can actually have 12, 13, and\n14 enabled over here, inadvertently.\n\n509\n00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:25,300\nBut if you go to some of these other\nplaces, it's totally legal to use that.\n\n510\n00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,730\nHere, it's not legal to use that, it puts\nout power, that's outside the license ban,\n\n511\n00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,340\nand you could get caught.\n\n512\n00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:39,700\nAnd that's the big thing,\nnotice I said could.\n\n513\n00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:45,640\nWith the FCC, and this isn't encouragement\nto anybody to do anything illegal.\n\n514\n00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,290\nThe FCC usually doesn't, unless you're\ndoing something that's really nasty,\n\n515\n00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,930\ndoes not come out an actively look for\nthis type of stuff.\n\n516\n00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,330\n>> They don't have vans driving around,\nlooking for\n\n517\n00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,980\npeople that have overpowered their\naccess point or anything like that.\n\n518\n00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,591\n>> Yeah, if you get caught because\nyou overpowered your access point,\n\n519\n00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:05,156\nyou have extremely bad luck.\n\n520\n00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:05,876\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n521\n00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:08,740\n>> Or you're near something\nthat you interfered with.\n\n522\n00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,860\n>> Yeah, like if you're next to\nsome kind of government building or\n\n523\n00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,250\nsomething like that or\nsomebody that's gonna complain.\n\n524\n00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:18,020\nAnd you start, they can't set up their\nwireless network because you've got\n\n525\n00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,275\nsomething that's glowing over there,\n[SOUND] over at your house.\n\n526\n00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:24,625\nEnough complaints, enough noise,\nthat might draw their intention, but\n\n527\n00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:29,300\nin general, If you're not interfering with\nother people, they might not even notice.\n\n528\n00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,200\n>> Yeah and don't take that as\nsome blank check to go through and\n\n529\n00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,110\njust say rock and roll.\n\n530\n00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,540\n>> Right.\n>> No, that's definitely not,\n\n531\n00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,430\nillegal's illegal whether\nyou get caught or not.\n\n532\n00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:45,750\nBut remember that, yes,\nyou could very well get caught.\n\n533\n00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:49,650\nIf you have an access point,\nit's another really good example.\n\n534\n00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,010\nIf you have an access point and\nyou overpower that thing and\n\n535\n00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,280\nyou happen to live anywhere near any\nairport, you're gonna get caught.\n\n536\n00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,970\nAnd we're not talking commercial\nones either, we're talking even\n\n537\n00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,605\nthe smaller airports, you will get caught,\nit's only a matter of time.\n\n538\n00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:08,985\nI'm a pilot myself.\n\n539\n00:28:08,985 --> 00:28:14,215\nIt interferes with our radios and it can\ninterfere with some instrument landing,\n\n540\n00:28:14,215 --> 00:28:20,190\nin instruments they use on their aircraft,\nit is entirely possible.\n\n541\n00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,540\n>> We don't wanna bring any planes down,\n\n542\n00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,050\nwe don't wanna stop anybody's pacemaker\nthat might be walking by our house.\n\n543\n00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,149\nSo, let's keep it legal\nis what we're suggesting.\n\n544\n00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,824\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n545\n00:28:31,824 --> 00:28:33,642\nBe smart about this stuff and\n\n546\n00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:38,690\nit's possible to inadvertently run\nafoul of some of these things.\n\n547\n00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,230\nSo, if you're gonns be working with RF,\n\n548\n00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,300\nstick with the RF the way that\nthey're actually designed.\n\n549\n00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,530\nIf you're getting a commercial grade one,\n\n550\n00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,020\nthat's where it sometimes\ngets a little funky.\n\n551\n00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:52,730\nIs when you get the commercial grade ones,\nyou have to choose\n\n552\n00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,180\ndifferent types of antenna's\nyou can use with it.\n\n553\n00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,638\nSo, that's up to you.\n\n554\n00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:03,570\nYou gotta choose the cabling that hooks\nthose antennas up to the access point.\n\n555\n00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,520\nAnd the types of cables plus the antenna\n\n556\n00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,420\ncan actually alter how much\npower is being put out.\n\n557\n00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,631\nYou could actually say this\naccess point is a lie,\n\n558\n00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:14,896\nit can put out this much power but\ndoing this could tamper with it enough and\n\n559\n00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:17,122\nalter it enough where I\ncould put outside of that.\n\n560\n00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,870\nThat's why you've got all that RF math and\nstuff like that that we're not gonna do\n\n561\n00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,779\nhere\n>> Thank God [LAUGH].\n\n562\n00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:26,291\nAll right, I'll tell you what, I know we\ngot a couple more wireless standards to\n\n563\n00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:30,380\ngo over, but looking at our clock,\nit's about time for us to take a break.\n\n564\n00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:34,540\nSo, why don't we stop here and when we\ncome back, we'll continue on with wireless\n\n565\n00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,580\nstandards and then, start diving into\nsome of the really exciting stuff.\n\n566\n00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,300\nSo, stay tuned.\n\n567\n00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,142\nWe'll be back shortly.\n\n568\n00:29:40,142 --> 00:29:45,153\n[MUSIC]\n\n569\n00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:48,658\nWelcome back, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n570\n00:29:48,658 --> 00:29:50,892\nContinuing on with our wireless chapter,\n\n571\n00:29:50,892 --> 00:29:55,356\nChapter 15 in Sean's book CEH Study Guide\nfor Version 8, we left off talking about\n\n572\n00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:59,345\nsome wireless standards, and we didn't\nmake it all the way through those.\n\n573\n00:29:59,345 --> 00:30:02,183\nSo, that's probably a good\nplace to jump back into it.\n\n574\n00:30:02,183 --> 00:30:03,971\n>> Yep, we gotta get back into it.\n\n575\n00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:06,839\nYou know what, they gotta say,\nwe got an alphabet soup here,\n\n576\n00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:08,705\nwe gotta finish up before the meal.\n\n577\n00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:11,845\n>> That's right. [LAUGH] >> So,\nwe gotta like rock and roll on this.\n\n578\n00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:12,345\nAll right.\n\n579\n00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:13,655\n>> So, where did we leave off?\n\n580\n00:30:13,655 --> 00:30:15,295\nLet's see, we talked about A,\nwe talked about B.\n\n581\n00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,050\nWe said there was no C.\n\n582\n00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,600\nNo, there was a C, but it got folded up.\n\n583\n00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,060\nBut anyways, A, B,\nG maybe would be a good place to go.\n\n584\n00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:28,024\n>> Yeah, G would be the next place to\ngo on this whole list of standards.\n\n585\n00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:33,530\nSo, 802.11 G,\nit's a later standard of course.\n\n586\n00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,270\nIt is a faster standard.\n\n587\n00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,613\nIt did do the 54 megabits and\n\n588\n00:30:37,613 --> 00:30:43,156\nit did operate in the same range\nas B does, 2.4 same channel range.\n\n589\n00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:45,985\nSo, we've got some similarities there and\n\n590\n00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:50,870\nit is backwards compatible with B,\nso that's a big benefit.\n\n591\n00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:53,280\nSo, that's a cool thing about it.\n\n592\n00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,530\nYou could have an 802.11 G access point\nand have B clients attached to it.\n\n593\n00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,675\nB clients aren't gonna be able\nto go up to 54 megabits but\n\n594\n00:31:00,675 --> 00:31:05,120\nthey are gonna be able to talk, so\nthat's a very, very big benefit.\n\n595\n00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,690\nSo-\n>> You know that G really gave us the best\n\n596\n00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,430\nof both worlds, what we had so far.\n\n597\n00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,160\nWe had A, which had good speed,\n\n598\n00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:16,040\n54 megs per second, bringing five GHz but\nit only had about a 60 foot range or so.\n\n599\n00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,926\nA was the five GHz, 54 mega bits\n\n600\n00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:26,466\nper second, 60 foot range.\n\n601\n00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:30,300\nThen, they had B which is much slower,\n11 megabits per second but\n\n602\n00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,730\nhad a range of close to 328 feet,\ntheoretical or\n\n603\n00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,320\nsomething like that, operated on 2.4 GHz,\nnot compatible with each other.\n\n604\n00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,980\nG kind of brought them all together.\n\n605\n00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,358\nWe got that speed that we would see on\nan A network, that 54 megabits per second,\n\n606\n00:31:44,358 --> 00:31:47,276\nplus we've got the range that\nwe saw on our B networks,\n\n607\n00:31:47,276 --> 00:31:49,507\nwe've got about 300 feet out of that.\n\n608\n00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:52,549\nSo, it kinda brought the best of\nboth worlds and I think to me,\n\n609\n00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:56,426\nG is where it really started getting fun\nand useful to have wireless in the pad.\n\n610\n00:31:56,426 --> 00:32:00,062\nYeah, B was kinda yay, I've got wireless.\n\n611\n00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:03,425\nAnd it's okay for a couple of things,\nbut if I was trying files or\n\n612\n00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:07,980\nanything like that, there's no way I'm\ngoing to send it over that B network.\n\n613\n00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,900\nThe other thing we should point out,\nsome of those early access points,\n\n614\n00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:14,740\nif a B device came in range,\nthe access point would slow down.\n\n615\n00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,750\nRight?\nIt would drop to the speed of the slowest\n\n616\n00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,840\nnode that was connected.\n\n617\n00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,836\nSome of the later ones actually\nfixed that issue, I think.\n\n618\n00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,710\nBut something to keep in mind.\n\n619\n00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,210\n>> Yeah.\n\n620\n00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:30,180\nThe main thing is the backwards\ncompatibility, that they have it.\n\n621\n00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,490\nYeah, there were some speed problems.\n\n622\n00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,360\nYou're absolutely right about that.\n\n623\n00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,510\nBut they've long since solved\nthose types of issues.\n\n624\n00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:43,730\nThey're were some teething problems but\nwhen don't you have those for technology.\n\n625\n00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,849\nNow everything is working better.\n\n626\n00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:50,370\nThe compatibility still's there.\n\n627\n00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:53,830\nWe're getting the performance so\neveryone's happy.\n\n628\n00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,810\nSo then after G then we went to N.\n\n629\n00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,420\nN's where we are right now.\n\n630\n00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,780\nIt's the 2.4 and 5.\n\n631\n00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:05,740\nAnd it has greater speed.\n\n632\n00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,370\nIt has much greater speed than what\nwe had in previous things, and\n\n633\n00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,610\nthe speed tends to be a moving\ntarget depending on who you ask.\n\n634\n00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,790\n>> You won't see it quoted\nout there too often, or\n\n635\n00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,620\nsome people'll say 300,\nsome people'll say 600.\n\n636\n00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,590\nRemember, N has some cool options.\n\n637\n00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,800\nMIMO, multiple in, multiple out.\n\n638\n00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,180\nYou can use both of those bands to\ncombine up some channels as well,\n\n639\n00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,755\nso it's really hard to say,\nthis is what it's gonna do,\n\n640\n00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:30,860\ncuz it really depends on\nhow you have configured.\n\n641\n00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:34,070\nSame thing with the range, because\nwe've got the different bands in there,\n\n642\n00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,559\nit's difficult to go out on the,\nI mean, I've searched.\n\n643\n00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,130\nIt's really difficult to find somebody\nwho quote you distances on it.\n\n644\n00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,590\nBut I've done my own personal test,\n\n645\n00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:47,278\nnot very scientific but it's a much\nfurther range than I was seeing with a G.\n\n646\n00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:53,695\n>> Yeah,\nthat's the thing I've noticed too so,\n\n647\n00:33:53,695 --> 00:33:58,835\nto hear someone else say it, as well.\n\n648\n00:33:58,835 --> 00:34:02,035\nWe know it's, faster we know\nit's got a better range but,\n\n649\n00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:04,793\nthat seems to vary depending\non who you want to ask.\n\n650\n00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,304\nYou could ask four different people and\n\n651\n00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:09,355\nget ten different answers\n>> If your talking about the manufacturer\n\n652\n00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:13,584\nof the access point or the device,\nthey're gonna say, man, it's 600 feet or\n\n653\n00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,876\nit's gonna be 600 megabits per second.\n\n654\n00:34:15,876 --> 00:34:19,110\nTalk to somebody else,\nsomebody that's actually using it,\n\n655\n00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,168\nthey might not tell you the same thing.\n\n656\n00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:27,248\n>> Yeah, absolutely so be prepared for\nthat when you see N out there,\n\n657\n00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:31,420\nthat N is gonna have that variation in it.\n\n658\n00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,960\nA lot of it comes down to\nthe implementation, stuff like that.\n\n659\n00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,903\nTo separate those answers people are\ngetting, you have to get into how are they\n\n660\n00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:41,891\nimplemented in their specific case and\nthen that will start\n\n661\n00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:45,376\nanswering more of the questions on\nwhat speed you should be getting.\n\n662\n00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,418\n>> Right, yep.\n\n663\n00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:51,620\nThen recently, we've seen the advent\nof a sea of devices being released.\n\n664\n00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,010\nA lot more expensive but\nbetter range, better speeds.\n\n665\n00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,250\nThey have added on some,\nthey expanded out the range\n\n666\n00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:02,480\non the frequencies that we\ncan use on those AC devices.\n\n667\n00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,370\nBut really, to me personally,\nI don't know about you,\n\n668\n00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,410\nI haven't invested in any of them.\n\n669\n00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,820\nBecause the cost is still,\nit's the new technology.\n\n670\n00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,190\nIt's not being mass produced\nlike the other stuff just yet.\n\n671\n00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:19,990\nSo, to me, it's not worth moving from\nN and upgrading all of my devices.\n\n672\n00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,460\nBut you're gonna have some networks\nthat are early adopters, so\n\n673\n00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,520\nwe need to be familiar\nwith that one as well.\n\n674\n00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,120\n>> Yeah.\nThere's AC that we just talked about.\n\n675\n00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,870\nWe just talked over lunch about AD.\n\n676\n00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:34,250\nThere's another one out there,\nit's still too early for those ones.\n\n677\n00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,530\nThose ones, first of all,\njust to make sure we're clear on it,\n\n678\n00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,075\nthey're not the exam.\n\n679\n00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:40,650\nN's as far as you have to go and\n\n680\n00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,940\neven that, they're just kind of\ntouching on in general sense.\n\n681\n00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,270\nAll the stuff we're talking\nabout still applies, but\n\n682\n00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,070\nthey're still kind of\nlike in a general sense.\n\n683\n00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,680\nOkay yeah, N's out there,\nwe're aware of it.\n\n684\n00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,360\nAnd blahbity blah,\nthen they kind of move on.\n\n685\n00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,813\nFor AC and AD, yeah,\nthose will not be on the exam, so\n\n686\n00:35:58,813 --> 00:36:01,835\ndon't expect them to show their face.\n\n687\n00:36:01,835 --> 00:36:05,294\nThere are two other wireless\nstandards that are relevant.\n\n688\n00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:09,876\nOne of them will be in the exam,\nthe other one will not.\n\n689\n00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,627\n802.15 for Bluetooth.\n\n690\n00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:17,640\nThat is something that is covered,\nand we're gonna be talking about that.\n\n691\n00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,740\nThen there's 802.16 for\nWiMAX which is long range wireless,\n\n692\n00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,870\nyou know municipal area wireless.\n\n693\n00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:28,855\nSometimes they call it, that one,\nit's just for your information.\n\n694\n00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:32,780\nSo, we don't really do any pen\ntesting with that as of yet,\n\n695\n00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,650\nany major pen testing with it at least.\n\n696\n00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:40,274\nThere is pen testing done but it's usually\nrestricted on who's doing it, the 15 with\n\n697\n00:36:40,274 --> 00:36:45,835\nBluetooth, yeah, you'll be pen testing\nthat, it's pen Bluetooth is everywhere.\n\n698\n00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:48,629\n>> All right so those are most of\nthe standards that were going to,\n\n699\n00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:52,265\nall the standards, really, that we're\ngoing to have to deal with for this exam,\n\n700\n00:36:52,265 --> 00:36:53,918\nand that we should be familiar with.\n\n701\n00:36:53,918 --> 00:36:57,530\nAnd mainly at this point,\nunderstanding speeds, range,\n\n702\n00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,009\nfrequency is a big one, and knowing\nwhich ones will work with each other,\n\n703\n00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:06,930\nbecause I've got to know how to connect\nto that access point to test it.\n\n704\n00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,180\nSo I've got to have the right equipment,\nand make sure, that it's compatible\n\n705\n00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,360\nwith whatever they are running on that\nnetwork so, got all the standards.\n\n706\n00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,460\nThe next thing we'll talk about then is\njust some terminology to make sure you\n\n707\n00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,210\nknow, as with anything,\nyou've got to have the terminology so\n\n708\n00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,280\nyou can talk intelligently about it.\n\n709\n00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,130\nAnd I know most of you\nare familiar with this.\n\n710\n00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,200\nSo as a quick refresh,\nwe're going to start with terminologies.\n\n711\n00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,105\n>> Let's talk about some basic\nterminology here since it is going to\n\n712\n00:37:34,105 --> 00:37:35,626\nappear on the exam.\n\n713\n00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:42,501\nBefore we get in to start using the stuff\nand using the terminology there.\n\n714\n00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:45,260\nLet's make sure we're\nall on the same page.\n\n715\n00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,250\nWe have things like, one of the things\nthat's gonna pop out right away\n\n716\n00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,450\nis an SSID, I'm gonna start talking\nabout those right up front so\n\n717\n00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,040\nwe've gotta know what those are.\n\n718\n00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,460\nAnd SSID is what identifies a network.\n\n719\n00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,720\nWhen you go through your list of\nwireless networks on your device to try\n\n720\n00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,150\nto find one, SSID is what you're seeing.\n\n721\n00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,830\nSSID can be cloaked,\nso it's not displayed.\n\n722\n00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,335\nThat is a common tactic for\npeople to use, to do with hidden network.\n\n723\n00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,002\nWe're also going to\nlearn that's [CROSSTALK]\n\n724\n00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:16,543\n>> They think they're so safe, don't they?\n\n725\n00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:18,085\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n726\n00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:25,750\nNothing's really hidden that way if you\nreally know where to look or how to look.\n\n727\n00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,170\n>> Yeah.\n\n728\n00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,953\nYeah with the SSID, I don't know, do we\nwant to talk about some of that stuff yet\n\n729\n00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:30,795\nor save that for later?\n\n730\n00:38:30,795 --> 00:38:31,677\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> We'll talk about\n\n731\n00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,130\nsome more of it a little bit.\n\n732\n00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:33,680\nIn a little bit.\n\n733\n00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,180\n>> All right.\n>> [CROSSTALK].\n\n734\n00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:36,700\n>> So the SSID, security set identifier.\n\n735\n00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,960\nI like to think of it as\na wireless workgroup name.\n\n736\n00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,133\n>> That works.\n>> It's one common way to kind of draw\n\n737\n00:38:42,133 --> 00:38:43,160\nan analogy.\n\n738\n00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,792\nBut as Sean said, when you open up\na wireless device, these access points\n\n739\n00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:50,793\nbeacon information about themselves so\nthat we can see them and connect to them.\n\n740\n00:38:50,793 --> 00:38:55,464\nThe SSID is the name we give that access\npoint, so that we can connect to the right\n\n741\n00:38:55,464 --> 00:38:59,668\none, or connect to the wrong one\ndepending on what we're trying to do.\n\n742\n00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:00,251\n>> As the case may be.\n\n743\n00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:02,370\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's good.\n\n744\n00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:05,650\nThe SSID ad hoc,\nthat's one we don't hear that often.\n\n745\n00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,710\n>> Yeah, you don't.\n\n746\n00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,830\nThere are two types of ways you can\nimplement wireless networks, ad hoc or\n\n747\n00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,420\ninfrastructure.\n\n748\n00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,390\nAd hoc is akin to a peer-to-peer type\nsituation where you have, you know,\n\n749\n00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,950\none notebook attaching or\none device attaching to another directly,\n\n750\n00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,060\nwithout going through an access point.\n\n751\n00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,150\nInfrastructure is where you\ndo involve an access point.\n\n752\n00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,220\nThat tends to be,\nby fa,r the most common one you'll see.\n\n753\n00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:30,040\nDoesn't mean you're never\ngoing to see an ad hoc one,\n\n754\n00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,170\nit just means they're probably not\nas common, or they aren't as common.\n\n755\n00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,460\nAnd then if you look at\nyour list of networks,\n\n756\n00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,665\nmost people don't even notice\nthat there's an ad hoc there.\n\n757\n00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:40,650\nCuz they're not looking at\nthe icon as much anymore.\n\n758\n00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,970\nThey're like, oh, that looks free,\nthat looks free, whatever.\n\n759\n00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,616\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n760\n00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,330\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Just a little bit to the left over\n\n761\n00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,496\nthere, you can tell what it is.\n\n762\n00:39:46,496 --> 00:39:49,852\n>> Yeah,\nthey should put something in there.\n\n763\n00:39:49,852 --> 00:39:51,414\nThey should just rehire,\n\n764\n00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:55,331\nMicrosoft should hire should hire\nClippy again to be like [LAUGH].\n\n765\n00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,608\nThat's like, go there.\n\n766\n00:39:56,608 --> 00:39:57,903\n>> Good old Clippie.\n\n767\n00:39:57,903 --> 00:39:58,733\n>> Yeah.\n\n768\n00:39:58,733 --> 00:39:59,987\n>> You can get them cheap now.\n\n769\n00:39:59,987 --> 00:40:02,200\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n770\n00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,339\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah, so Ad Hoc is, again peer\nto peer type I see these often when you\n\n771\n00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:08,535\ngot a couple people in a conference room,\n\n772\n00:40:08,535 --> 00:40:11,516\nthey just need to share files\nfiles between each other.\n\n773\n00:40:11,516 --> 00:40:15,085\nThey can set up a real quick Ad Hoc\nnetwork where they connect to each other,\n\n774\n00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:18,936\nand as Shaun said, there is no central\naccess point, so if you got four devices,\n\n775\n00:40:18,936 --> 00:40:20,807\nfour laptops in this conference room,\n\n776\n00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:24,100\nthey'll basically make a mesh\nnetwork between each other.\n\n777\n00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,930\nTalking directly to each other does not\ngive you access to the wired portion of\n\n778\n00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,840\nthe network, right?\n\n779\n00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,870\nThis is separate from your wired.\n\n780\n00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,250\nWhereas infrastructure\nis meant to be able to,\n\n781\n00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:39,160\na way to tie into the wired network, or\ncommunicate with other wireless devices.\n\n782\n00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,740\nBut you're not commuting,\nremember with infrastructure,\n\n783\n00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,610\nyou're not communicating directly\nwith the other wireless client.\n\n784\n00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,060\nYou're actually bouncing it to the access\npoint and then back out to the client.\n\n785\n00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,850\nAd Hoc,\nthere is no central connectivity point.\n\n786\n00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,390\nEverybody's talking\ndirectly to each other.\n\n787\n00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:57,570\n>> Yeah, absolutely right, and that's by\nfar the one that you're going to run into.\n\n788\n00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,710\nThat tends to be the easiest,\nthe most equipment is available for it.\n\n789\n00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,820\nBut yes, you can set up that peer to peer,\nthat Ad Hoc,\n\n790\n00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,550\nif that's what you want to transfer files\nback and forth and do that kind of stuff.\n\n791\n00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,190\n>> I've used it a couple of times just for\na quick situation where I've got a guy\n\n792\n00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,830\nthat's on a wired network but\nhis device also supports wireless.\n\n793\n00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,190\nI don't have a patch cable with me.\n\n794\n00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,000\nThere's no open ports around.\n\n795\n00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,230\nWe just created a quick, ad hoc network so\nwe could swap some files back and\n\n796\n00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,680\nforth and then you close it down and\nyou're done with it.\n\n797\n00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,290\nSo, that's typically where I see it used,\n\n798\n00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:31,380\nis temporary wireless\nconnectivity between nodes.\n\n799\n00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,050\n>> Yeah.\nAnd it works great for that.\n\n800\n00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:39,610\n>> So we got Ad-Hoc and M-structure the\ndifferent ways we can set up a wireless\n\n801\n00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,120\naccess or a wireless network or\na wireless workgroup.\n\n802\n00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,620\nAnd then we've got rogue access points.\n\n803\n00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,800\n>> Yeah, a rogue access point.\n\n804\n00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,862\nA rogue access point has a beard,\neye patch,\n\n805\n00:41:51,862 --> 00:41:52,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n806\n00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,090\n>> Does that.\n\n807\n00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,270\nDrinks whiskey\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n808\n00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,720\n>> You know how it is.\n\n809\n00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,061\nYeah.\nPirating your signal.\n\n810\n00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,400\n[LAUGH].\n\n811\n00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,160\nBut rouge access point is another\nterm you're going to hear used today,\n\n812\n00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,290\nrouge access point is one that is set up\nbut you don't have direct control over it.\n\n813\n00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,492\nIt means that someone set\none up in the area and\n\n814\n00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:23,160\nusually they;re doing it for,\nI shouldn't say usually.\n\n815\n00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,370\nBut it's not uncommon for them to be use\nto attract people in to attach to it.\n\n816\n00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,380\nTo cause them to attach to something\noutside your corporate network perhaps.\n\n817\n00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,740\nOr it could be someone inside your company\nthat plugged a wireless access point in.\n\n818\n00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,120\nAnd while they may not\nhave had bad intentions,\n\n819\n00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,370\nthey just didn't configure\nit the right way.\n\n820\n00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,970\nOr just put one there\nperiod that shouldn't be.\n\n821\n00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:50,230\nSo it's one that's not allowed by company\npolicy or not covered by company policy.\n\n822\n00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:54,400\n>> Yeah, so any type of access point\nthat's not there, that shouldn't be there,\n\n823\n00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,280\nwe could consider that a rogue.\n\n824\n00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,160\nAnd a very common way to try to get\ninformation or just start one of these\n\n825\n00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,590\nattacks that we'll talk about cause I\ncould name it something like Starbucks2.\n\n826\n00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,640\nAnd who's gonna think about it,\n\n827\n00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,970\nthey see two networks in there, one is\nStarbucks the next one is Starbucks2.\n\n828\n00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,220\nHeck, Starbucks2 has a better signal,\nI'm gonna click on that one and\n\n829\n00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,430\nconnect to it right?\n\n830\n00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,810\nAnd lots of different ways that we\ncan use those rogue access points.\n\n831\n00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,350\nAnd as Sean said,\nsometimes it's not even intentional.\n\n832\n00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,330\nI've told my users.\n\n833\n00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,390\nWe're not doing wireless.\n\n834\n00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,470\nWe can't do that, it's against policy.\n\n835\n00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,540\nThat guy has just got to spin around in\nhis chair and not use wires on his laptop.\n\n836\n00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,240\nHe brings one from home and puts it\nunder his desk not thinking about all\n\n837\n00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,050\nthe security vulnerabilities that\nhe's just exposed our network to.\n\n838\n00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:36,390\nDefinitely got to watch out for\nthose rogues.\n\n839\n00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:37,780\nGot to find them and get rid of them.\n\n840\n00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:42,240\nAlright so some of the terminology\nis there more terminology here.\n\n841\n00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,460\n>> Yeah there's probably there's some more\nterminology we should probably throw out\n\n842\n00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:50,890\nthere you know we have a terms that\nwe're gonna start seeing we're gonna\n\n843\n00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,660\nsee honey pot that comes out here.\n\n844\n00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:59,515\nActually in the wireless world they call\nthem honey spas if you can believe that.\n\n845\n00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:02,280\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Yeah I had that discussion with\n\n846\n00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,170\nan editor as well.\n\n847\n00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,290\nNot that the editor's wrong.\n\n848\n00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:07,440\nIt's like don't you mean hot spot,\nor honey pots?\n\n849\n00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,800\nIt's like no, honey spa.\n\n850\n00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,720\nLike are you sure?\n\n851\n00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,360\nReally cute.\n\n852\n00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,140\nA honeyspot.\nIt's like that's what they're\n\n853\n00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:14,980\nsupposed to do.\n\n854\n00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,180\nThey're supposed to ask questions.\n\n855\n00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:16,790\nAre you sure.\n\n856\n00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,680\nI'm like yeah.\nBut it's not a common term.\n\n857\n00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,990\nIt's one that EC council uses.\n\n858\n00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,820\nBut outside that we're just\ngoing to call it a honeyspot.\n\n859\n00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,580\nIt's a combination of a honey\npot which is used to attract.\n\n860\n00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,230\nAn attacker and\n\n861\n00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,660\na hotspot, which is a wireless access\npoint people are allowed to attach to.\n\n862\n00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,210\nSo they're combining the two.\n\n863\n00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,730\nAnd once you look at the two base words\nthat it's made out of to make the new one,\n\n864\n00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:44,350\nyou've got the whole concept right there.\n\n865\n00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,630\nIf you understand those two things.\n\n866\n00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,490\nKinda guess what a honey spot is doing.\n\n867\n00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:53,280\nI'm gonna show you an example of\na honey spot here in a bit, and\n\n868\n00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,180\nkind of taking a look at it.\n\n869\n00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,080\nSo it's a pretty neat thing.\n\n870\n00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,860\nSo we have that.\n\n871\n00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:02,070\nWe also have the terms of gigahertz,\n\n872\n00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,500\nthat's what they measure\nthe frequencies in for wireless.\n\n873\n00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:10,000\nSo you're gonna hear,\nyou're gonna hear stuff like 2.45,\n\n874\n00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,550\nthere's 60 gigahertz out there.\n\n875\n00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:17,320\nSo those are some, those some different\nthings that are measured in that.\n\n876\n00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:22,130\nWe also have a terms like WEP, WPA and\nWPA2, which are security standards,\n\n877\n00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:27,200\nwhich we're going to get to those\na little more in depth here in a bit.\n\n878\n00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,500\nAnd then there's things like,\npre-shared keys is another one.\n\n879\n00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:35,150\nThe pre-shared key is what you use\n\n880\n00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,910\nto identify something that's\nallowed to attach to a network.\n\n881\n00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,676\nYou put a key on the network.\n\n882\n00:45:40,676 --> 00:45:43,673\nAnd you give a key to the client,\nand they just go ahead and\n\n883\n00:45:43,673 --> 00:45:45,840\nthey're allowed to attach.\n\n884\n00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,620\nSo those are just some of the basic terms.\n\n885\n00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,410\nAnd we're going to get into\nsome more beyond here, but\n\n886\n00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:55,830\nthose are some of the core ones.\n\n887\n00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:00,900\nI guarantee some of these terms you'll\nnever see them outside of this, or\n\n888\n00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,698\nyou just won't run into them.\n\n889\n00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:07,830\nJust like, when you talk about Honeyspot.\n\n890\n00:46:07,830 --> 00:46:09,810\nYou'll probably never\nhear it outside of that.\n\n891\n00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,640\nYou can use it if you want,\nno one's saying you're wrong.\n\n892\n00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,400\n>> Right.\n>> You're probably\n\n893\n00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,490\ngonna get some weird kind of-\n>> Yeah.\n\n894\n00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:16,980\n>> Did you just make that up?\n\n895\n00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,210\n>> They try sometimes\nto introduce new terms.\n\n896\n00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,060\nSometimes they stick,\nsometimes they don't.\n\n897\n00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:21,750\nI remember.\n\n898\n00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,220\nThe first time I read Hacktivism.\n\n899\n00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:27,640\nI was like okay this is just a way\nto coin a new phrase or something.\n\n900\n00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:33,530\nIt turns out that it's caught on and\nthere is definitely a use for that.\n\n901\n00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,887\nSo we'll see if that sticks around or not.\n\n902\n00:46:35,887 --> 00:46:36,460\n[LAUGH].\n\n903\n00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,540\n>> Yeah, we're gonna make it stick around,\nI think.\n\n904\n00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,890\nYou're hearing the term more and more.\n\n905\n00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,150\nThat's what I think they're trying to do.\n\n906\n00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:45,830\nWe will so we will have this thing\nstick around no matter what.\n\n907\n00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:48,640\nSomeone took the time to coin the phrase.\n\n908\n00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,750\nThey're going to get their\nmoney's worth out of it.\n\n909\n00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:52,560\n>> Absolutely.\n\n910\n00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:55,860\nAll right.\nSo we got a lot of terms.\n\n911\n00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,870\nWe'll use those terms as we go\nthrough the lesson most likely, and\n\n912\n00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:01,810\nthat'll help us define them a little more.\n\n913\n00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,030\nNext thing we want to talk about,\nantennae types.\n\n914\n00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,930\n>> Yeah, let's discuss some of those\nto get things moving on that is what\n\n915\n00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:15,450\nthe different antennae types are and how\nthey can affect your wireless networks.\n\n916\n00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:19,750\nWe're gonna be using these things over and\nover again in here, and we talk about our\n\n917\n00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:25,040\nwireless networks, and we're gonna be\ntalking about even later some variations.\n\n918\n00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:33,090\nOn the theme, so, but the thing is when we\ntalk about wireless antennas, we've got a,\n\n919\n00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,670\nthere's four main options and then\nthere's variations of each one of those.\n\n920\n00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:41,980\nWe have the standard\nomnidirectional antenna,\n\n921\n00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,190\nwhich sends stuff out in every direction.\n\n922\n00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:48,228\nWe've got the dipole antenna,\n\n923\n00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:52,388\nwhich is one that you usually see\nassociated with access points.\n\n924\n00:47:52,388 --> 00:47:56,475\nI've got an example of them back here.\n\n925\n00:47:56,475 --> 00:47:59,587\nThis is a dipole antenna.\n\n926\n00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:02,621\nThe thing with something like this,\nwhen you go down and look at it,\n\n927\n00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:05,250\nI feel like I should be standing\nover here cause it's all.\n\n928\n00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,670\n>> I know right, kinda camouflaged.\n\n929\n00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:08,540\nHold it in front of the red\nspot on your shirt.\n\n930\n00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,630\n>> You can see it right?\n\n931\n00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:14,912\nYeah it's there trust me I yeah,\nI cloaked my network, look at that.\n\n932\n00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:15,672\n[LAUGH].\n\n933\n00:48:15,672 --> 00:48:18,395\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH] That's good, I like that one.\n\n934\n00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,775\n>> But anyway,\nI'm gonna do the Harry Potter thing.\n\n935\n00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,465\nLook at that I can do,\nI got that all going.\n\n936\n00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:27,195\nYeah from McCaler our UK person,\nthere we go.\n\n937\n00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:35,150\nSo [LAUGH] but what this is,\nthis is a dipole Antenna here.\n\n938\n00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,595\nThis one goes out really\nin all directions.\n\n939\n00:48:38,595 --> 00:48:43,820\n>> [LAUGH] It goes out in all, I feel like\nI gotta, it goes out in all directions.\n\n940\n00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,650\nBasically what it is is signal for\nthis one.\n\n941\n00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,600\nAnd why it says it goes out in all\ndirections, it actually got a,\n\n942\n00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,500\ncentered on here like a doughnut.\n\n943\n00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,080\n>> Yeah.\n\n944\n00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:55,210\n>> That's the key thing is that you think\nit's like oh it has a big ball round here\n\n945\n00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:59,680\nthat's that iso directional antenna,\nthose don't exist outside of.\n\n946\n00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,710\nComputer models.\n\n947\n00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,490\n>> Right.\n\n948\n00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:04,080\n>> This one actually has something\ncentered on it like a doughnut so\n\n949\n00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,630\nit means if you move this thing,\nthat doughnut is staying centered on it.\n\n950\n00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,340\nSo if you go up here above the antenna or\ndown below the antenna,\n\n951\n00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,930\nthe signal's not as great.\n\n952\n00:49:12,930 --> 00:49:15,030\nSo that's something to remember.\n\n953\n00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,480\nIf you go through and you have this\nthing plugged into your access point,\n\n954\n00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:20,300\nyou're playing around at home,\ntrying to make the rabbit ear deal,\n\n955\n00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,340\nyou're actually taking that doughnut and\nputting it at an angle.\n\n956\n00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,150\nSo if you're sitting over here\nyou're not getting a good signal.\n\n957\n00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:32,111\nYou need to kind of make that\nthing straighten up and fly right.\n\n958\n00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:34,940\n>> And I'll tell you that's something\nthat back 10, 15 years ago.\n\n959\n00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,400\nWell, actually, no,\nit wasn't that long ago was it?\n\n960\n00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,750\nAnyway, it looks cool, right,\nyou remember the old WRT54G's,\n\n961\n00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:47,180\nor before that those BE11's or\nwhatever we had,\n\n962\n00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,700\nyou know I had mine sitting on my desk and\nyou want those antennas kinda pointing\n\n963\n00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,090\nout like that cause they look cool,\nright they're kinda slanted like that.\n\n964\n00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,890\nAnd then you realize you're sending\nhalf your single upstairs, or\n\n965\n00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:01,175\ndownstairs, you're not really\ncovering the floor that you're on.\n\n966\n00:50:01,175 --> 00:50:02,900\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Yeah, that looked really good.\n\n967\n00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,730\nIt's what they see on TV and\nin the movies and stuff, but\n\n968\n00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,950\nyou really want to make sure-\n>> Why wouldn't you want to do this?\n\n969\n00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,520\n>> I know.\n[LAUGH] But it does,\n\n970\n00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,690\nit looks like a doughnut,\nor almost like a butterfly.\n\n971\n00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:18,150\nPinches down in the middle, around that\ndipole, and then goes out like that.\n\n972\n00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,830\nSo watch those guys.\n\n973\n00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,620\nI feel like we're back at lunch again.\n\n974\n00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,095\n>> Yeah, I know, right.\n\n975\n00:50:27,095 --> 00:50:28,540\n[LAUGH].\n>> You like that cover.\n\n976\n00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,678\n>> Yeah, I'm a wireless, like,\nyou know, master on this one.\n\n977\n00:50:31,678 --> 00:50:36,463\nLook I'm catching flies right now.\n\n978\n00:50:36,463 --> 00:50:37,117\n[LAUGH].\n\n979\n00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,717\n>> [LAUGH] Grasshopper.\n\n980\n00:50:38,717 --> 00:50:39,371\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n981\n00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:42,140\n>> So we got omnidirectionals,\nwhich as Sean said,\n\n982\n00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,520\nreally don't exist because of\nthe manufacturing process.\n\n983\n00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:48,920\nIf it was a true omnidirectional you'd\nneed something in the very center\n\n984\n00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,000\nsending out an equal.\n\n985\n00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,490\nStrength signal in 360 degrees in\na sphere and we just can't do that.\n\n986\n00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:58,090\nSo, we've got that pole up\nin the middle which ends up\n\n987\n00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,300\npinching that signal down from the top.\n\n988\n00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,640\nIt's gonna look a lot like\na donut from the side.\n\n989\n00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,090\nYou might think butterfly wings or\n\n990\n00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:07,420\nsomething like that where\nit grows as it goes out.\n\n991\n00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,900\nThe other one you mentioned was the Yagi.\n\n992\n00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,160\n>> The Yagi is another interesting one.\n\n993\n00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,390\nIt's a directional antenna.\n\n994\n00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:14,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> It is another one.\n\n995\n00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,310\n>> You guys have all seen it\nwhether you know it or not.\n\n996\n00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:20,760\nSome of you are old enough to\nremember the aerial antennas from TV\n\n997\n00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,230\nbefore we had cable.\n\n998\n00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:27,480\nIf you've ever watched a nature show and\nthey've got the radio tag on an animal.\n\n999\n00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,576\nAnd they're trying to track\nthat animal down, and\n\n1000\n00:51:29,576 --> 00:51:32,561\nthey're waving this antennae back and\nforth, and it's like, [SOUND].\n\n1001\n00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:36,525\nIt gets stronger as they point it\ntowards the source of that signal.\n\n1002\n00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:40,060\nThat's a Yagi, and\nthat's a directional antennae.\n\n1003\n00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,070\nSo we're taking the signal strength that\nwe would have sent out in 360 degrees\n\n1004\n00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,260\nwith that dipole.\n\n1005\n00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,370\nWe're kind of focusing\nit down a little bit.\n\n1006\n00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,170\n>> Yeah it focuses it like a cone,\nis what it's doing.\n\n1007\n00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,320\nIt's like laying a cone on it's side.\n\n1008\n00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:56,080\nSo it's centered right on that\naccess of that Yagi antenna.\n\n1009\n00:51:57,290 --> 00:51:59,500\nThat worm you can kind of point that.\n\n1010\n00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,600\nThat cones gonna move with it.\n\n1011\n00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,740\nOnce you move outside that cone,\nthe signal dissipates pretty quickly or\n\n1012\n00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,830\npretty quickly.\n\n1013\n00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:07,540\nIt dies off.\n\n1014\n00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,130\nThey're good for\n\n1015\n00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:15,670\nsecurity reasons because you can keep\na signal focused someplace pretty nicely.\n\n1016\n00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,120\nThey're good for site to site\ncommunications, because you could connect\n\n1017\n00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,220\na couple buildings and have this bleed all\nover the place and keep that really nice,\n\n1018\n00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,400\nstrong, concentrated signal.\n\n1019\n00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,540\nSo they're really neat and\nyeah, they are used in.\n\n1020\n00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,505\nEndless and different applications\nlike that for radio tracking.\n\n1021\n00:52:29,505 --> 00:52:31,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1022\n00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,000\n>> At home, I work with search and\nrescue teams, and\n\n1023\n00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,920\nthat's what they have on aircraft,\nor something like that go down.\n\n1024\n00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,260\nWhen they have a hiker,\nit set's off one of those radio things.\n\n1025\n00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,760\nThey use a device with\nthe Yagi antenna for that.\n\n1026\n00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,660\n>> Right.\n>> They have people\n\n1027\n00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,638\nout there in the field that\nare sweeping and able to track it.\n\n1028\n00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:50,630\nRight back to track\nthe source to where it is,\n\n1029\n00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,710\nto find that down aircraft or\nthat lost hiker, or whatever.\n\n1030\n00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,540\n>> You can actually get a little\nbit more distance out of a Yagi\n\n1031\n00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,790\nbecause it's directional.\n\n1032\n00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:01,920\nI'm not having to take that power\nto send the signal out 360 degrees.\n\n1033\n00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,810\nSo, you can imagine, I'm taking all,\nsame amount of power.\n\n1034\n00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:08,830\nBecause the FCC in the States, and\nother organizations outside of the States,\n\n1035\n00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,590\nlimits how much power we have\navailable to supply to these radios.\n\n1036\n00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:16,990\nSo the same amount of power, but focus\nthat signal down into a wedge like this.\n\n1037\n00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:19,330\nAnd I can go even further\nwith that signal.\n\n1038\n00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,980\nOther ones we might deal with, parabolics.\n\n1039\n00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,360\n>> Yeah the parabolics are another\ndirectional antenna but\n\n1040\n00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:28,530\nthey also increase\nthe range substantially.\n\n1041\n00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:32,630\nWhen a signal comes out\nof a parabolic antenna\n\n1042\n00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:35,980\nthey all go to a focus point\nin the middle of that dish.\n\n1043\n00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,960\nIt's actually suspended in the air.\n\n1044\n00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,890\nIn front of that dish,\n\n1045\n00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:43,100\nthat's where you have the receiver\nkind of sitting out there, and\n\n1046\n00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,800\npoint that in the right direction and you\ncan get miles of range out of this thing.\n\n1047\n00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,190\nIt's just like transmission\npower you can get that too,\n\n1048\n00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:55,380\nthe way they concentrate stuff,\nso they're really nice and.\n\n1049\n00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,280\nUseful for various applications.\n\n1050\n00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,310\nI know that you can get\nvarious sizes of those too.\n\n1051\n00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:07,200\nAnd they have the parabolic\nones that are a solid dish and\n\n1052\n00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,730\nthen they have the ones that\nare parabolic mesh which are.\n\n1053\n00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:16,390\nThey look like a match, when you see\nthem they literally resemble that.\n\n1054\n00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,280\nTo the radio frequencies\nthey're both the same.\n\n1055\n00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:21,455\nRadio frequency doesn't care if\nthere's holes in that or not.\n\n1056\n00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:26,180\nIt's still the same thing,\nit still work with radio frequencies.\n\n1057\n00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,240\n>> Yeah, and you can make a much larger\nantenna because it's gonna be lighter.\n\n1058\n00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,910\nWinds are not going to affect it as much,\n\n1059\n00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:35,190\nbecause the air can sort\nof pass through that mesh.\n\n1060\n00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:39,380\nSo it makes it more efficient,\nI think, a parabolic antenna.\n\n1061\n00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:43,040\nYou guys have seen the old satellites, I\nthink somebody mentioned in the chat room,\n\n1062\n00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,870\nthe old satellite dishes we had for\nTV way back in the day.\n\n1063\n00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,760\nMy dad still has one of those big.\n\n1064\n00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,550\nMotorized monstrosity's\nthat sits up on the roof.\n\n1065\n00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:54,540\nYou need a crane, he's like we need to\ntake that down, it doesn't work anymore.\n\n1066\n00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,810\nWell, who's taking it down?\n\n1067\n00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:56,740\nI'm not climbing up there and\n\n1068\n00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:59,700\ntrying to disconnect that and\nroll down the roof with it.\n\n1069\n00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,190\n[LAUGH] I mean that thing's not light.\n\n1070\n00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,660\nYou need a crane out there\nto get that thing down.\n\n1071\n00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:06,300\nAnd then, what's another antenna?\n\n1072\n00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,900\nOne of my favorites that\nwe don't see a lot, or\n\n1073\n00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,300\nwe don't see mentioned here is the.\n\n1074\n00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:14,420\nThe can tenna right take that guy out.\n\n1075\n00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,060\n>> Yeah that's you know when we get to\nwhen we talk more about war driving yeah I\n\n1076\n00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,730\nknow where your going\n>> We'll find that out then\n\n1077\n00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,310\n>> That's another directional antenna type\n\n1078\n00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:24,925\nand yeah that's that is a cool type I know\nexactly what you're talking about [LAUGH]\n\n1079\n00:55:24,925 --> 00:55:26,040\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1080\n00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,880\n>> So yeah, we'll save that for war drive.\n\n1081\n00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,346\nLet's not spoil the surprise to early.\n\n1082\n00:55:30,346 --> 00:55:34,280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Interestingly enough, if you look up\n\n1083\n00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,735\nsomething else you can do as a little home\nproject, you know those DirectTV dishes?\n\n1084\n00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Those dish ones.\n\n1085\n00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:44,520\nYou can actually take those in and\nmodify those to make them 802.11 antennas.\n\n1086\n00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,079\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\n1087\n00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:47,180\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Two of them\non my fence right now.\n\n1088\n00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:47,930\nThey're not in use.\n\n1089\n00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,620\n>> Yeah, look it up.\n\n1090\n00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,645\n>> Guess what I'm doing this weekend.\n\n1091\n00:55:49,645 --> 00:55:50,555\n[LAUGH].\n\n1092\n00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,321\n>> I've got a project for you.\n\n1093\n00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:57,236\nYeah, it's just there's a few tweaks you\ngotta do to it and you can probably do it\n\n1094\n00:55:57,236 --> 00:56:02,398\nif you're, hand you a soldering iron and,\nyou can do the thing probably in an hour.\n\n1095\n00:56:02,398 --> 00:56:04,660\nYou can have a lot greater range.\n\n1096\n00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:05,240\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n1097\n00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,770\n>> And all that stuff so.\n\n1098\n00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,360\nYeah.\n\n1099\n00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,643\nOr you could teach your\nneighbors a lesson.\n\n1100\n00:56:08,643 --> 00:56:09,758\n>> Yeah, right.\n\n1101\n00:56:09,758 --> 00:56:12,514\n[LAUGH]\n>> Either way.\n\n1102\n00:56:12,514 --> 00:56:13,742\nI'm not picky.\n\n1103\n00:56:13,742 --> 00:56:18,310\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well I'll tell you\nwhat, ladies and gentlemen, looks like,\n\n1104\n00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,620\nlooking at the clock here it's about time\nfor us to go ahead and take a break.\n\n1105\n00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,060\nAnd I think we covered most\nof our antenna types there?\n\n1106\n00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:23,740\n>> Yes, we did.\n\n1107\n00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,380\n>> Alright, so why don't we go ahead and\ntake a break here.\n\n1108\n00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,550\nWhen we come back,\ncontinuing on with our wireless chapter.\n\n1109\n00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,885\nSo sit back, We'll see you soon.\n\n1110\n00:56:31,885 --> 00:56:36,590\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back,\n\n1111\n00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:39,956\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n1112\n00:56:39,956 --> 00:56:44,380\nDiving back into our wireless chapter,\ngetting ready to talk about wireless\n\n1113\n00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,396\nsecurity standards,\nif you could .Sometimes you want to say\n\n1114\n00:56:48,396 --> 00:56:52,360\nthat's an oxymoron, but\nthere are some much better standards now.\n\n1115\n00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,270\nThose of you that have been in it\na while know what I mean when I say\n\n1116\n00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,140\nit's an oxymoron.\n\n1117\n00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:59,950\n>> [LAUGH] It's one of those things.\n\n1118\n00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:03,610\nWireless, when they first\ninvented it they knew that having\n\n1119\n00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,470\nsecurity for was a big thing considering\nthat they're beaming your information\n\n1120\n00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,220\nall over the universe and back.\n\n1121\n00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:15,940\nSo, what they did was they came up\nwith the first thing, which was WEP.\n\n1122\n00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:20,910\nAnd that was designed to encrypt and\nprotect information, but\n\n1123\n00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:24,750\nit was really just,\nit was poor by any stretch.\n\n1124\n00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,370\nIt was not done right.\n\n1125\n00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,550\n>> And most people that were\nimplementing it knew this, and\n\n1126\n00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:30,800\nwe weren't putting on sensitive data,\nand things like that, but\n\n1127\n00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,890\nthere were some people that weren't\naware of the vulnerabilities or\n\n1128\n00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:39,270\nthe weaknesses that were discovered\npretty quickly after WEP was introduced.\n\n1129\n00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:44,620\nAnd it's one of the big reasons that I\nthink that wireless didn't really pick up.\n\n1130\n00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:49,240\nYou saw on the home front, but in a\nbusiness world when we still had just WEP,\n\n1131\n00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,340\nit was there but\n\n1132\n00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,050\nnot a a big player in our networks,\nbecause it was so insecure, right?\n\n1133\n00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:55,880\nThe predictable IP.\n\n1134\n00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,190\nAnd I don't know if we wanna dive,\nhow far we wanna go into it.\n\n1135\n00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:00,310\n>> We can talk about some of that, yeah.\n\n1136\n00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,090\nIt is important to know some of that.\n\n1137\n00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:02,710\n>> Yeah.\n\n1138\n00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,370\n>> Yeah, you're spot on with it, is that\nyeah, when they brought out WEP initially,\n\n1139\n00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:07,630\nit sounded like a great idea.\n\n1140\n00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:10,300\nOn paper it sounded like a great idea.\n\n1141\n00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,560\nBut the way they implemented it,\nit just was really poor.\n\n1142\n00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,820\nIt used very short keys\nwhen it first came out.\n\n1143\n00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:19,850\nEven when they lengthened the keys,\nthe way they generated the keys and\n\n1144\n00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:21,890\nexchanged information was bad.\n\n1145\n00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:22,940\n>> Predictable.\n\n1146\n00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:25,690\n>> Very predictable, absolutely.\n\n1147\n00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:31,100\nAnd it led to just a number of problems\nand ultimately all those problems had\n\n1148\n00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,200\nled to the fact that WEP can be\nbroken very, very, very easily.\n\n1149\n00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,160\nRight now the record is about ten seconds,\nmaybe even less now.\n\n1150\n00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:39,840\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n1151\n00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,550\n>> So they're breaking, they can recover\nyour WEP key with zero knowledge.\n\n1152\n00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:47,940\nThey can recover that in and\nless time that it takes for\n\n1153\n00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,090\nyou to think of one and type it in.\n\n1154\n00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:51,750\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> So, it's weak.\n\n1155\n00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,860\n>> And there's tools, automated tools\nout there that can do this stuff.\n\n1156\n00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:58,300\nIf there's not enough traffic being\ngenerated on the network on its own,\n\n1157\n00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,510\nthen it'll send packets to\nthe access point that are going\n\n1158\n00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,700\nto cause it to respond\nto generate traffic.\n\n1159\n00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,920\nAnd so, they don't even have to know\nanything to crack WEP nowadays.\n\n1160\n00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,550\nThey just click, click and\nboom, they've got the password.\n\n1161\n00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:16,250\nIt's one of those things we say, it\nshouldn't be used anymore at this point.\n\n1162\n00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:21,210\nBut it also, I do like to tell people\nthat if it's all you have, turn it on.\n\n1163\n00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:22,570\nRight.\nI mean, don't leave it off.\n\n1164\n00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,470\nIt keeps the honest people honest.\n\n1165\n00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,490\nIt's like I say about\nthe old bathroom window lock,\n\n1166\n00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:29,020\nthe ones that you can take\nthe butter knife and jimmy open.\n\n1167\n00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,940\nThat doesn't mean I\nleave the window unlock.\n\n1168\n00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,465\n>> Done that before Mathew?\n\n1169\n00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:36,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> Did I say that with too much\n\n1170\n00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:38,700\nconfidence, there you go.\n\n1171\n00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,300\nI don't leave it unlocked.\n\n1172\n00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:43,150\nI still lock it even though I\nknow it's kind of pointless.\n\n1173\n00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,200\nBut, it's the same thing with WEP.\n\n1174\n00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,180\nIf it's all you got, use it.\n\n1175\n00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,820\nAnd I know I saw a question in\nthe chat room much earlier so\n\n1176\n00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:54,000\nI forgot who actually asked the question,\nwhy is WEP still around?\n\n1177\n00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,770\nWell, backwards compatibility\nis the big thing.\n\n1178\n00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:02,420\nIt is one of those situations where it's\nstill there because it could be somebody's\n\n1179\n01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:06,670\nonly option if they've got an older\noperating system, older network adapter,\n\n1180\n01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:09,950\nor something like that that just doesn't\nsupport, because as we move to the newer\n\n1181\n01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:14,090\nwireless security standards,\nthe encryption goes up,\n\n1182\n01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:18,600\nand that means the processing power and\nthing like that go up as well.\n\n1183\n01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:23,170\n>> Yeah, there'll be element of that, but\nthe discussion that I always seem to have\n\n1184\n01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:26,670\nin that area is that, yeah,\nyou're right, it's legacy stuff.\n\n1185\n01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:32,100\nYou've got older stuff that\nmay need that standard.\n\n1186\n01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,610\nWhen did they start introducing WPA?\n\n1187\n01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,180\nWas it about 2002, 2003,\nsomewhere in there?\n\n1188\n01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:41,430\nSome of the chat rooms\non Wikipedia right now.\n\n1189\n01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,810\n>> I'm sure somebody will know who he is.\n\n1190\n01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:45,265\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just to go, I know a teacher.\n\n1191\n01:00:45,265 --> 01:00:46,030\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1192\n01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:50,760\n>> But it was somewhere around then,\nso you've got to look at what you got,\n\n1193\n01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:54,570\nwe'll just roughly say\na decade it's been around.\n\n1194\n01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:56,605\n>> Hopefully your laptop is not that old.\n\n1195\n01:00:56,605 --> 01:01:01,179\n>> Yeah, if it's that old, then you gotta\nretire that hamster and get a new one.\n\n1196\n01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:02,979\nYou just have to.\n\n1197\n01:01:02,979 --> 01:01:08,340\nIt's been around for quite awhile.\n\n1198\n01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:14,060\nThey include it, yeah, for legacy, but\nrealistically it just should not be used.\n\n1199\n01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,370\n>> Right.\n>> But, as you rightfully brought up\n\n1200\n01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:22,790\nis that if there's nothing else,\nit's still better than nothing.\n\n1201\n01:01:22,790 --> 01:01:27,610\nI hear stuff James says under 60 seconds\nfor a WEP, that's actually under ten.\n\n1202\n01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:29,560\nEven now.\n\n1203\n01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:32,070\nSo 60 seconds is scary enough\nwhen someone decided to\n\n1204\n01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:38,120\nreduce that down to about 10\nseconds which I've seen done.\n\n1205\n01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:44,350\nThe thing is that I can say about 10\nseconds sounds like a, well, oh, my god,\n\n1206\n01:01:44,350 --> 01:01:46,300\nI'm not using it, that's horrible.\n\n1207\n01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,030\nIt's the only thing you should use.\n\n1208\n01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:53,820\nStill should use it, because I could put\na room together of 100 IT people and\n\n1209\n01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,580\nsay which ones are you converting.\n\n1210\n01:01:56,580 --> 01:01:58,160\nCan WEP be broken?\n\n1211\n01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,290\nAnd, probably all of them will go,\noh yeah, WEP can be broken.\n\n1212\n01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,870\nHow many of you can do it?\n\n1213\n01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,550\nI might get two or three.\n\n1214\n01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,250\n>> Right.\n\n1215\n01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,310\n>> So, while, it's not entirely,\nincredibly difficult.\n\n1216\n01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:10,536\nIt does take some effort and\nnot many people, not a ton of people,\n\n1217\n01:02:10,536 --> 01:02:13,245\nrelative to the number of IT people,\nknow how to do it.\n\n1218\n01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:14,198\n>> Right, right.\n\n1219\n01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:15,241\nSo, use it if it's all you've got,\nit is really the point there.\n\n1220\n01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:16,506\n>> But It is getting easier like you said.\n\n1221\n01:02:16,506 --> 01:02:17,157\n>> Yeah.\n\n1222\n01:02:17,157 --> 01:02:21,910\n>> It's getting to be push button,\nI was showing you this during the break.\n\n1223\n01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:26,092\nI mean it's a flash drive but\nI got something like this.\n\n1224\n01:02:26,092 --> 01:02:28,550\nThis has a live distro of Linux on it.\n\n1225\n01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:32,030\nAll I have to do is pop this in\nto any system, boot off of it.\n\n1226\n01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,040\nAnd it will detect your network card and\n\n1227\n01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:38,180\nwith a few button clicks it'll\nautomatically collect keys for me.\n\n1228\n01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,900\nI don't have to do anything.\n\n1229\n01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:45,895\nYou just sit there and let it do its thing\nfor a while and I come back, boom, done.\n\n1230\n01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,432\n>> Right, that's impressive.\n\n1231\n01:02:47,432 --> 01:02:48,558\n>> Yeah.\n\n1232\n01:02:48,558 --> 01:02:50,878\n>> [COUGH] So if WEP is so bad and\n\n1233\n01:02:50,878 --> 01:02:56,730\nit's not recommended to use it,\nwhat came after WEP?\n\n1234\n01:02:56,730 --> 01:03:02,880\n>> In response to the problems\nwith WEP and just quickly, to\n\n1235\n01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,900\nkind of tell you where WEP went wrong and\nwhat they did with the WPA to correct it.\n\n1236\n01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,830\nWhen WEP came out it\nwas implemented poorly.\n\n1237\n01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:13,500\nBasically, those boiled down to,\na small number of areas.\n\n1238\n01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:17,040\nThe big ones being the fact\nthat you got people that work,\n\n1239\n01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,420\ncryptographic experts doing it.\n\n1240\n01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:21,260\nYou have a bunch of electronic\nengineers doing that,\n\n1241\n01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,980\nthat are not the right\nones to be doing this.\n\n1242\n01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:26,190\nThey did a great job wireless and\nnetworking and all that side of it.\n\n1243\n01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:30,350\nThere's no arguing that, but\nelectrical engineers are not\n\n1244\n01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:33,060\ncryptographers that do\nspecialize in that stuff.\n\n1245\n01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,520\nSo, they didn't implement\nit the right way.\n\n1246\n01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:39,939\nThey took a good algorithm and\nimplemented incorrectly or improper way.\n\n1247\n01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,866\nAnd no one was brought in to help them\nwith that or even review the results.\n\n1248\n01:03:45,866 --> 01:03:47,782\nTherefore, you get a bad result.\n\n1249\n01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:52,043\nOne of the things I said,\nway early on in this course Of CEH,\n\n1250\n01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:57,927\nwe talked about cryptography, and all\nthe things we talked about cryptography,\n\n1251\n01:03:57,927 --> 01:04:00,740\neven though it was a brief primer.\n\n1252\n01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,950\nBut I also said that it's not\nsomething that the everyday Joe is\n\n1253\n01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,690\ngonna be able to go through and write\nformulas, and stuff like that with it.\n\n1254\n01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,190\nMost people don't have to do that,\nso we don't.\n\n1255\n01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:12,450\nThat takes a very good level of knowledge,\nspecialized level of knowledge.\n\n1256\n01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:14,260\nIn this case, it was,\n\n1257\n01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:19,730\nyou had that situation where people\ndidn't do that, and they caused problems.\n\n1258\n01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:24,430\nThey actually weakened what was,\nwhich could have been a good system.\n\n1259\n01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,360\nSo then they went to WPA.\n\n1260\n01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,900\nThey rolled all the the learned\ntheir lessons and\n\n1261\n01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,580\nrolled some of the rolled those\nlessons forward to that and\n\n1262\n01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:36,510\nmade a much stronger system you know so\nyou know\n\n1263\n01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:41,120\nwhat happens is that they did academic\nreview they implemented good cryptography.\n\n1264\n01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,640\nYou know so\nthey had a much greater system with WPA or\n\n1265\n01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,440\nWiFi protected access you know so that was\n\n1266\n01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,760\na really great thing it didn't suffer\nfrom those vulnerabilities that WEP did.\n\n1267\n01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,645\n>> And for the most part you could\ntypically upgrade your device.\n\n1268\n01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:58,865\nWith WPA then we have flash for\nthe firmware on your routers or\n\n1269\n01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:02,195\nyour network adapters and\nthings like that get a new driver for it.\n\n1270\n01:05:02,195 --> 01:05:08,450\nAnd you could support WPA and again\nmuch more secure than we have with WEP.\n\n1271\n01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:10,880\nAnd we had a question\nthe chatroom asking Sean\n\n1272\n01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,300\nwhat distro are you using on\nthat Scandisk thumb drive?\n\n1273\n01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,320\n>> This is a.\n\n1274\n01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,560\n>> Is that the one you started with?\n\n1275\n01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,300\nI know you said it was very customized.\n\n1276\n01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,550\n>> Yeah,\nthis was actually based off of Boonton.\n\n1277\n01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:24,570\n>> Off of Boonton, ok.\n\n1278\n01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:30,760\nAlright, so WPA comes on the scene and\nraises the bar a little bit by.\n\n1279\n01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:38,300\nAs Shaun said, addressing some of the\nflaws that were found in the WEP, the WP\n\n1280\n01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:42,490\nincrease the keylength I think was one\nof the things they introduced with that.\n\n1281\n01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:46,540\nThey also upped the algorithm used,\nI think they went to TKIP,\n\n1282\n01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,980\nin WPA, so they made some improvements\nthere, made it a little stronger.\n\n1283\n01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:55,210\nBut it still wasn't perfect, right?\n\n1284\n01:05:55,210 --> 01:06:00,510\nIt still had it's vulnerabilities, that\nwere discovered after it was released.\n\n1285\n01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:04,580\n>> Yes, they found some issues with it and\nit's not something you can say that\n\n1286\n01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:08,780\nregularly gets broken, it has been\nbroken and that's all we care about.\n\n1287\n01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,160\nSo they upped the bar again.\n\n1288\n01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,040\nAnd looked at the 802.11 I standards and\n\n1289\n01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,880\nimplemented this WPA2 which just\nraises the bar substantially\n\n1290\n01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,620\nbrings stronger encryption to the table\nbrings better key management.\n\n1291\n01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:30,340\nBrings dynamic rekeying to the table so\nit actually rekeys every so many packets.\n\n1292\n01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:34,690\nOr over a certain period of time\nyou can tell it to rekey so\n\n1293\n01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,580\nit brings a new key out.\n\n1294\n01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:40,900\nSo if you do break the key by some\nstroke of luck you're able to break that\n\n1295\n01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,340\nIt's only going to be used for a brief\nperiod of time anyway before it's rekeyed.\n\n1296\n01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:45,370\nThen on top of that,\n\n1297\n01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:49,500\nthey also introduce stuff that\nsolved some of the problems before.\n\n1298\n01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:52,180\nThe key management part,\nthey brought in for large.\n\n1299\n01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,350\nThey brought in enterprise management,\n\n1300\n01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:57,820\nwhich meant you had a radius\nserver some place for\n\n1301\n01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:02,650\nexample that people would authenticate\nagainst and distribute keys appropriately.\n\n1302\n01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:05,690\nSo no more entering the keys directly.\n\n1303\n01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,730\nOn a system anymore.\n\n1304\n01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:12,140\nYou could put them in a central repository\nand have it go through and do that.\n\n1305\n01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:16,150\nThen they also still do the pre-shared\nkey like most people use at home.\n\n1306\n01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:20,010\nYou can use WPA2 at home without\nhaving a radia server and all that,\n\n1307\n01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:21,710\nstill works great.\n\n1308\n01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:27,160\n>> Exactly, and as Sean mentioned,\nthat WPA2 is that 802.11i standard.\n\n1309\n01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,140\nFrom the IEEE.\n\n1310\n01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:33,730\nIn fact WPA was really developed outside\nthe IEEE and it was meant as a stopgap\n\n1311\n01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:38,700\nbecause the IEEE knew that WEP was not\nthe solution they wanted to stick with.\n\n1312\n01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,110\nBut it does take a long time for\nthem to ratify new standards.\n\n1313\n01:07:41,110 --> 01:07:44,650\nThey've got to go through lots of testing,\nget unanimous support and all of that.\n\n1314\n01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:46,940\nSo when the IEEE.\n\n1315\n01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:49,930\nSo when the 802.11i came out I think\neverybody just called it WPA2 and\n\n1316\n01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:51,405\nit kinda stuck.\n\n1317\n01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:55,080\nCause it is very, very similar to\nwhat the standard ended up being.\n\n1318\n01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,240\nSo, very good.\n\n1319\n01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,330\nSo you've got a few different options\nwhen it comes to wireless security.\n\n1320\n01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:02,610\nYou've got WEP at the bottom end,\ndefinitely not recommended to use unless\n\n1321\n01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:07,300\nit's all you've got, cause it's easy to\ncrack, like Sean said, within ten seconds.\n\n1322\n01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,370\nWPA's the next step up from that.\n\n1323\n01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:13,090\nWhich was great because I didn't\nhave to go out and buy new hardware.\n\n1324\n01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:18,570\nI could typically upgrade my hardware\nto support this newer security method.\n\n1325\n01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:20,430\nBig improvements over WEP,\n\n1326\n01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:23,360\nstill had a couple of vulnerabilities\nthat it had to deal with.\n\n1327\n01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,210\nAnd then finally the IEEE\ncame out with their 802.11i.\n\n1328\n01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:28,620\nWhich everybody just refers to as WPA2.\n\n1329\n01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:34,110\nWhich solved a lot of them which\nis not to say it's bulletproof.\n\n1330\n01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:39,170\nAs we always say, as processing\npower in our devices gets better and\n\n1331\n01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:44,010\nbetter it starts becoming easier to\ncrack longer keys and things like that.\n\n1332\n01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:46,660\nBut with the fact with the way that\nit rotates through those keys.\n\n1333\n01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:50,190\nYou said, even if they do crack that key,\nthey're gonna get temporary access.\n\n1334\n01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:52,790\nBut as soon as that key's changed,\nthey gotta start all over.\n\n1335\n01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:53,600\n>> Yeah.\n\n1336\n01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,000\n>> So definitely the way to go.\n\n1337\n01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,740\nAnd both WPA and WPA2 support\nthe two different modes, right?\n\n1338\n01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:02,030\nYou've got the WPA and\nWPA2 in personal mode,\n\n1339\n01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:05,420\nwhich means you're using a pre-shared key.\n\n1340\n01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:08,840\nOr you've got the WPA and\nWPA2 both have an enterprise mode.\n\n1341\n01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,710\nWhere we're using certificates and\nmost likely something like RADIUS,\n\n1342\n01:09:11,710 --> 01:09:12,920\nor that 802.1x.\n\n1343\n01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:18,420\nWhere we're offloading that authentication\nfrom the access point to somewhere else,\n\n1344\n01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,880\nbecause I've got a bunch of better\nsecurity, that server can handle,\n\n1345\n01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,360\nwe can move the authentication back\nlike inside our DMZ if we want, I mean,\n\n1346\n01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:27,830\nbehind our DMZ,\ninside the corporate network.\n\n1347\n01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,500\nLeaving that access point out there\nin the DMZ, so if it gets attacked.\n\n1348\n01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,150\nThey still have to, they're not going\nto be able to get hopefully back into\n\n1349\n01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,300\nthe corporate network to break the\nauthentication process that's going on.\n\n1350\n01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,930\n>> Yeah, it's those layers,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n1351\n01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:44,140\nPut those layers together and it's easily\nscalable and allows stuff like that,\n\n1352\n01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:48,280\nso it makes it much more comfortable for\ncorporate networks.\n\n1353\n01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:52,570\nAnd it's reasons like that are why you\n\n1354\n01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:58,300\nstart to see Corporations start to\nadopt more wireless technologies,\n\n1355\n01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:03,160\nbecause they saw better ways to protect it\nand defend it than they had in the past.\n\n1356\n01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,830\nIt wasn't the same thing someone\nwould be using at their home.\n\n1357\n01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,320\n>> Yeah.\nAnd, a very common set-up you see\n\n1358\n01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:11,820\nnowadays in a corporate network is the\nwireless access point sits out in the DMZ.\n\n1359\n01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:17,110\nWhere we can connect to it and\nI can then segment that traffic so\n\n1360\n01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,290\nsome people connect that wireless access\npoint maybe it can give you internet\n\n1361\n01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,460\naccess for guests that visit our building.\n\n1362\n01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:26,800\nThey can still access Access point,\nand they go out to the internet and\n\n1363\n01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,080\nthey can't get back into\nthe corporate network.\n\n1364\n01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,600\nAnd I'm not as worried about\nsecurity now because again,\n\n1365\n01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,270\nthe authentication's been moved off of\nthat device back into the radius for\n\n1366\n01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,540\nthose people that wanna connect and\nget into my wire Corporate side of things.\n\n1367\n01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,730\nAll right.\nSo we've got different wireless security\n\n1368\n01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:42,910\nwe can implement.\n\n1369\n01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,340\nLet's talk about breaking.\n\n1370\n01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,470\nThat's kind of what we want to do, right.\n\n1371\n01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:47,370\n>> Breaking and entering.\n\n1372\n01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:48,662\n[CROSSTALK] we all get into.\n\n1373\n01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:49,830\n>> With permission of course.\n\n1374\n01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:50,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> Whether\n\n1375\n01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,562\nyou do it with a butter knife or\nwireless or, we're good.\n\n1376\n01:10:53,562 --> 01:10:55,320\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n1377\n01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:57,490\nYou know.\nAnd I think we mentioned earlier,\n\n1378\n01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:01,600\nyou know, it is difficult to secure\nwireless traffic because it's unbound.\n\n1379\n01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:05,060\nAs Sean said, it's floating out\nthere where if it's bound media,\n\n1380\n01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,690\na little bit easier to secure.\n\n1381\n01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:10,410\nYou've got to get either cut a cable and\ntie in, find an open port,\n\n1382\n01:11:10,410 --> 01:11:11,000\nsomething like that.\n\n1383\n01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,640\nWireless, all I need to do is be\nin range of your access point.\n\n1384\n01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,890\nAnd I can try to launch an attack.\n\n1385\n01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,325\nSo it was what kind of attacks do we have\nwhen we talk about attacking a wireless\n\n1386\n01:11:20,325 --> 01:11:20,920\nnetwork?\n\n1387\n01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,290\n>> Well, you got a tax in,\nin three categories.\n\n1388\n01:11:24,290 --> 01:11:27,080\nYou have the confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n1389\n01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:28,625\nUtility-based attacks,\n\n1390\n01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:34,135\neach one has its own benefits that\nit does and things you can do.\n\n1391\n01:11:34,135 --> 01:11:37,045\nSome of the attacks\nactually cross categories.\n\n1392\n01:11:37,045 --> 01:11:40,344\nI'm gonna show you some of\nthe stuff here that does that.\n\n1393\n01:11:40,344 --> 01:11:44,407\nBut yeah, some of the attacks you\ncan pull on some of the hardware and\n\n1394\n01:11:44,407 --> 01:11:48,685\ntechniques you need to do that, so\nbut yeah confidentiality attacks,\n\n1395\n01:11:48,685 --> 01:11:53,846\nstuff that means, that allows you to get\naccess to information when you shouldn't.\n\n1396\n01:11:53,846 --> 01:11:56,423\nSo one of the ways we can do that,\n\n1397\n01:11:56,423 --> 01:12:02,452\nis through a piece of technology that\nsome of you may have heard of already.\n\n1398\n01:12:02,452 --> 01:12:03,590\nI know some of you already heard of.\n\n1399\n01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:06,499\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just to kinda give you the intro to it,\n\n1400\n01:12:06,499 --> 01:12:09,012\nis through one called the WiFi Pineapple.\n\n1401\n01:12:09,012 --> 01:12:13,940\nWhich is an example of a WiFi honey spot.\n\n1402\n01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:17,750\nSo you can create an access point out of\nthis, it actually is an access point that\n\n1403\n01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:23,145\nthey flashed with a special distro of\nLinux that allows us to do a few things.\n\n1404\n01:12:23,145 --> 01:12:29,049\nIt can do stuff like pull in\nother clients in the area.\n\n1405\n01:12:29,049 --> 01:12:32,051\nIt can tell you that they're there,\ntell you their MAC address,\n\n1406\n01:12:32,051 --> 01:12:34,684\ntell you what access point\nthey're trying to attach to.\n\n1407\n01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:40,210\nAnd then I can even plug it into one side\nof my system through a USB adaptor or\n\n1408\n01:12:40,210 --> 01:12:45,738\nsomething, plug it into one part of\nmy system or a hard wired connection,\n\n1409\n01:12:45,738 --> 01:12:49,839\nand then we're gonna get\na second hard wired adaptor,\n\n1410\n01:12:49,839 --> 01:12:54,323\nand plug it into the wall,\ninto a normal wired connection.\n\n1411\n01:12:54,323 --> 01:12:58,678\nAnd what that has is that WiFi pineapple\nwill sit out there and attract clients to\n\n1412\n01:12:58,678 --> 01:13:02,448\nit and then when they connect to it,\nthey will go through my system and\n\n1413\n01:13:02,448 --> 01:13:06,730\nout the other side to that wired\nconnection that goes to the Internet.\n\n1414\n01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,500\nThat gives me the benefit of\nobserving all their traffic and\n\n1415\n01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,470\nrunning man in the middle attacks on it.\n\n1416\n01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,400\n>> Sneaky, so they still think,\nI mean to them they're still connected.\n\n1417\n01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,180\nThey can still connect\nall those resources,\n\n1418\n01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,840\neither on their Local Area Network or\nout on the Internet.\n\n1419\n01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:19,830\nThey don't know any better.\n\n1420\n01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:22,900\nThey're like, I'm connected,\neverything's working, nothing's wrong.\n\n1421\n01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,490\nUnaware that all of their traffic is\nflowing through the attacker's laptop.\n\n1422\n01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,450\n>> Exactly.\n\n1423\n01:13:28,450 --> 01:13:30,200\nThey're not going to see anything.\n\n1424\n01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,610\nAs far as they know they're getting\na connection to the Internet or\n\n1425\n01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:35,780\nwhatever, and everything's fine.\n\n1426\n01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:39,876\nThey have no idea they're being channeled\nthrough my notebook and well if\n\n1427\n01:13:39,876 --> 01:13:44,119\nI'm using a notebook we gotta channel\nthrough it its very very simple to do.\n\n1428\n01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:47,103\nAnd I'll just also throw it out there,\n\n1429\n01:13:47,103 --> 01:13:51,274\nI've got two pineapples here,\nbut I'm using a five.\n\n1430\n01:13:51,274 --> 01:13:54,360\nThis is a four, this is a mark four.\n\n1431\n01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,880\nWhat this is, you can see it's\na small little access point.\n\n1432\n01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:03,030\nI don't have my cell phone to\nshow you the relative size but\n\n1433\n01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:04,620\nabout a pack of cards, you would say?\n\n1434\n01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:05,740\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's not that big.\n\n1435\n01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:09,160\nThere's your iPhone kind\nof sitting next to this and\n\n1436\n01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,377\nyou can see it's footprint size,\nit's really not that big.\n\n1437\n01:14:12,377 --> 01:14:15,190\nSo you can, there you go, thanks for that.\n\n1438\n01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:22,018\nSo it's not that big, it's got Ethernet\nconnections or Ethernet connections on one\n\n1439\n01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:27,204\nside we'll call it that, power adaptor,\nand then it's even got a USB port.\n\n1440\n01:14:27,204 --> 01:14:30,989\nThe other one has this stuff too, but\nit has some nice blinky lights on it.\n\n1441\n01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:36,065\n>> [LAUGH] Blinky lights\nalways make it better, always.\n\n1442\n01:14:36,065 --> 01:14:37,260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1443\n01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:40,278\nI don't care what's in the box but\nas long as I see blinky lights.\n\n1444\n01:14:40,278 --> 01:14:40,980\n>> [LAUGH] Right?\n[LAUGH]\n\n1445\n01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,490\n>> That's some powerful stuff there, man.\n\n1446\n01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:49,263\nBut cool things about this is\nthat it's got this USB adaptor,\n\n1447\n01:14:49,263 --> 01:14:56,760\nI don't have to have this plugged\nto hard-wired into really anything.\n\n1448\n01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,250\nI can get a battery.\n\n1449\n01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,440\nThere's USB batteries.\n\n1450\n01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,360\nJust a battery you can plug in with USB.\n\n1451\n01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,100\nPlug it into the power adaptor.\n\n1452\n01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,360\nAnd then put your 3G adaptor,\n4G adaptor, in here.\n\n1453\n01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,185\nConfigure it to the web interface.\n\n1454\n01:15:10,185 --> 01:15:12,125\nAnd then just stick it some place and\n\n1455\n01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:16,715\nit will start, it will dial up to that\nUSB adaptor and let people connect to it.\n\n1456\n01:15:16,715 --> 01:15:20,045\nAnd they'll connect to the internet so\nI could conceivably go under here and\n\n1457\n01:15:20,045 --> 01:15:21,695\njust go pop under here\n>> Right.\n\n1458\n01:15:21,695 --> 01:15:23,000\n>> And no one will notice it.\n\n1459\n01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,790\nWow.\n\n1460\n01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:25,497\n>> So, and it will start tracking stuff.\n\n1461\n01:15:25,497 --> 01:15:26,307\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, so,\n\n1462\n01:15:26,307 --> 01:15:29,950\nit can be a pretty dangerous\nthing in the right hands.\n\n1463\n01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:30,526\n>> Yeah.\n>> Which, by the way,\n\n1464\n01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,231\nthe right hands are right here.\n\n1465\n01:15:31,231 --> 01:15:34,168\n[LAUGH]\n>> Are you sure these hands aren't right?\n\n1466\n01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:35,248\nI don't know, they look pretty good.\n\n1467\n01:15:35,248 --> 01:15:39,730\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, that's that one.\n\n1468\n01:15:39,730 --> 01:15:41,518\nTo kind of show you what\nit looks like inside,\n\n1469\n01:15:41,518 --> 01:15:43,509\nlet's take a look at my\nfirst computer over here.\n\n1470\n01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,840\nThis is inside the Wi-Fi honeypot.\n\n1471\n01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,670\nNow I'm not gonna do a whole\nbunch of stuff in here,\n\n1472\n01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:53,440\njust to kinda show you\nthe stuff that's inside this.\n\n1473\n01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:57,860\nIt looks pretty much like a normal,\nit's got some of the normal\n\n1474\n01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:02,370\nfunctions that a normal access point does.\n\n1475\n01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:05,330\nBut it does include some\nother stuff on here too.\n\n1476\n01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:08,130\nIt gives you the network information.\n\n1477\n01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:13,375\nI can drill deep into that and\ngive me some detailed information.\n\n1478\n01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:14,685\nOkay, that's good.\n\n1479\n01:16:14,685 --> 01:16:16,207\nBut, this one over here.\n\n1480\n01:16:16,207 --> 01:16:20,265\nI went ahead and enabled this earlier\non which is something called Karma.\n\n1481\n01:16:21,405 --> 01:16:22,805\nInteresting term for it, right?\n\n1482\n01:16:22,805 --> 01:16:23,885\nSo it's called Karma.\n\n1483\n01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:28,680\nAnd, what it does, that's where you\ncan see it's running right now,\n\n1484\n01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,750\nis use it to get some\ninformation ahead of time.\n\n1485\n01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:36,430\nWhat it does is Karma will actually\nread those probe requests that wireless\n\n1486\n01:16:36,430 --> 01:16:37,900\ndevices send out.\n\n1487\n01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,680\nSo, and\nevery wireless device that does that.\n\n1488\n01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:45,160\nIf you have a an active Wi-Fi connection,\nor have your Wi-Fi turned on rather.\n\n1489\n01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:48,390\nWhat will happen is it's sending\nout those probe requests and\n\n1490\n01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:52,200\nit's looking for wireless networks\nit previously attached too.\n\n1491\n01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,990\nSo, in this case,\nwhat the Wi-Fi Pineapple could do,\n\n1492\n01:16:55,990 --> 01:17:00,050\nit's gonna read those requests and then\nwhat its gonna do is it's gonna say okay,\n\n1493\n01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:03,940\nwell I'm gonna spoof that request and\nsend it back to you.\n\n1494\n01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:08,190\nSo, I'm gonna say, you're looking for\nthis network I read that probe request,\n\n1495\n01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,110\nI'm gonna tell you I am that\nnetwork which will cause you\n\n1496\n01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:14,790\nsince I'm a preferred network of yours\nsince you attached me previously,\n\n1497\n01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,130\nit could bring you over\nto this access point.\n\n1498\n01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:20,020\nAnd once it brings you\nover to that access point,\n\n1499\n01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:23,390\nnow it's a man in the middle attack,\nmaybe it's just a sniffing type thing.\n\n1500\n01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:25,660\nThere's nothing saying I have\nto alter that traffic and\n\n1501\n01:17:25,660 --> 01:17:27,910\nassault the integrity of information,\n\n1502\n01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:32,570\nit could be that I'm just want to\ncompromise the confidentiality of it.\n\n1503\n01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:35,744\nNow in this case,\nif I go over here to logs,\n\n1504\n01:17:35,744 --> 01:17:40,355\nit won't let me go over here actually,\nopen up Karma on here.\n\n1505\n01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:45,496\nAnd, I'll click on the Karma log,\nand what I have here is I've\n\n1506\n01:17:45,496 --> 01:17:50,741\ngot a list of access points,\nof things that have attached to it.\n\n1507\n01:17:50,741 --> 01:17:54,815\nIf we can zoom that up a bit, you can\nstart reading some stuff off of it,\n\n1508\n01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:59,305\nyou can see the MAC addresses, you can\nsee the MAC addresses in there in kind of\n\n1509\n01:17:59,305 --> 01:18:03,202\nthe center of that, then see the SSIDs\nover at the right hand side.\n\n1510\n01:18:03,202 --> 01:18:06,360\nOkay, well let's take\na look at what we see.\n\n1511\n01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:10,860\nOkay, we have five networks or\nsomething around here.\n\n1512\n01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:11,424\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> But\n\n1513\n01:18:11,424 --> 01:18:12,917\nthere's many more than\nfive networks showing up.\n\n1514\n01:18:12,917 --> 01:18:13,547\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> Take a look.\n\n1515\n01:18:13,547 --> 01:18:19,280\n>> Yeah, I see things like\nTaco Bell Wi-Fi, Sunny's Wi-Fi.\n\n1516\n01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:20,140\n>> Sephora.\n\n1517\n01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:21,900\n>> Sephora, which is at the mall.\n\n1518\n01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:25,725\nIs that really picking up\nfrom that far away or-\n\n1519\n01:18:25,725 --> 01:18:27,600\n>> It's not picking up from that far away.\n\n1520\n01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,300\nIt means that someone in the immediate\nvicinity, in this building some place,\n\n1521\n01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,824\nattached\n>> I've attached to it once before and\n\n1522\n01:18:33,824 --> 01:18:35,540\nthat's an issue I know Windows,\n\n1523\n01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:39,710\nI don't know if Linux does the same thing,\nif you check that little check mark that\n\n1524\n01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:43,400\nsays remember this network then\nit's always looking for it, right?\n\n1525\n01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:45,200\nHow does it know when it's in range.\n\n1526\n01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:49,280\nIt sends out those beacons and\nthat way as soon as you're in range,\n\n1527\n01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:51,260\nit can automatically connect to it.\n\n1528\n01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:53,590\nSo that's where we're picking up then,\nthat's interesting.\n\n1529\n01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:54,990\n>> Yeah, that's exactly what it's doing.\n\n1530\n01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:58,862\nIt's reading that request so\nit remembers that network.\n\n1531\n01:18:58,862 --> 01:19:01,365\nIt sent those probe requests,\nthis guy is reading them.\n\n1532\n01:19:01,365 --> 01:19:05,220\nSo, I've got this thing running.\n\n1533\n01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:09,625\nIn someone's building if they've got that\ndevice turned on which it looks like\n\n1534\n01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:10,480\nthey do.\n\n1535\n01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:14,790\nIf I want to be really aggressive about it\nthey're gonna attach to his access point.\n\n1536\n01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:18,060\nBecause they're gonna say, oh Sephora,\nwe attached to that one previously.\n\n1537\n01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,880\nBoom, I'm gonna go associate\nwith that access point.\n\n1538\n01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,810\nThey're not gonna see anything\nfunny on their device.\n\n1539\n01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:26,580\nThey're just gonna see all of a sudden\nthey've connected to something.\n\n1540\n01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:29,440\nThey might even see,\nhey I've suddenly connected to something.\n\n1541\n01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:34,510\nThey're not gonna see that whole hop to\nanother network where they're attached to.\n\n1542\n01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:37,683\nAnother interesting\nthing to do on this is,\n\n1543\n01:19:37,683 --> 01:19:42,333\nif you get a list of this I'm just\nkind of browsing through this.\n\n1544\n01:19:42,333 --> 01:19:44,874\nI mean, you can actually read\nthrough some of this stuff.\n\n1545\n01:19:44,874 --> 01:19:49,782\nI mean,\nthere's some more of Planet Fitness,\n\n1546\n01:19:49,782 --> 01:19:53,105\nThe Carlton Home, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1547\n01:19:53,105 --> 01:19:55,833\nI've got those things popping up.\n\n1548\n01:19:55,833 --> 01:20:00,012\nI can, you can read quite a bit off\nthis stuff and in the right conditions,\n\n1549\n01:20:00,012 --> 01:20:04,261\nwhich I haven't setup here and I'm not\nreally interested in doing that for\n\n1550\n01:20:04,261 --> 01:20:05,534\na course like this-\n>> Thank you.\n\n1551\n01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:06,161\n>> That's a whole new thing.\n\n1552\n01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:06,881\n>> We thank you for that.\n\n1553\n01:20:06,881 --> 01:20:08,577\n>> Is we could actually go and\n\n1554\n01:20:08,577 --> 01:20:11,978\nstart tracking people with\ninformation like this.\n\n1555\n01:20:11,978 --> 01:20:15,211\nThat's just a short hop, skip, and a jump.\n\n1556\n01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:18,280\n>> Yeah, cuz I could see exactly what\nwireless networks they've connected\n\n1557\n01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,024\nto over the last, I don't know how long.\n\n1558\n01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:24,512\nLike say somebody ate lunch at Sonny's\ntoday, somebody went over to the mall and\n\n1559\n01:20:24,512 --> 01:20:25,974\nwent into Macy's today.\n\n1560\n01:20:25,974 --> 01:20:29,110\nSo I can start figuring out who\nthat is and tracking them and\n\n1561\n01:20:29,110 --> 01:20:30,550\ngathering information.\n\n1562\n01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:31,955\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1563\n01:20:31,955 --> 01:20:32,685\n>> Scary.\n\n1564\n01:20:32,685 --> 01:20:39,745\n>> Yeah, and that's all automatic so I can\ndo that with either one of these devices.\n\n1565\n01:20:39,745 --> 01:20:41,199\nThe Karma runs on this too.\n\n1566\n01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:45,770\nThis thing, this is a Mark IV and\nthis other one I have\n\n1567\n01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:50,690\nsitting over here in the background,\nif you can kinda get that on camera here.\n\n1568\n01:20:50,690 --> 01:20:51,760\nThat's what this one is.\n\n1569\n01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,496\nThis one's a Mark V.\n\n1570\n01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:55,745\nYou can see the little blinky\nlights on it a little bit,\n\n1571\n01:20:55,745 --> 01:20:57,940\nkinda sitting over here on the side.\n\n1572\n01:20:57,940 --> 01:20:59,968\n>> It's worth an extra 40 bucks, right?\n\n1573\n01:20:59,968 --> 01:21:01,541\n>> Yeah,\nthat's an extra 40 bucks right there.\n\n1574\n01:21:01,541 --> 01:21:02,417\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1575\n01:21:02,417 --> 01:21:04,670\n>> Plus they incremented the number\nby one, so it's gotta be better.\n\n1576\n01:21:04,670 --> 01:21:05,999\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> I mean there's a five.\n\n1577\n01:21:05,999 --> 01:21:08,205\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1578\n01:21:08,205 --> 01:21:08,856\n>> So, and\n\n1579\n01:21:08,856 --> 01:21:12,681\nyou can see that one's\njust as small as this one.\n\n1580\n01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:17,730\nThis doesn't take much and\nyou can unscrew these antennas.\n\n1581\n01:21:17,730 --> 01:21:21,105\nAnd if this antenna isn't getting\nthe reception that you want,\n\n1582\n01:21:21,105 --> 01:21:23,166\nyou can take that off and screw a small,\n\n1583\n01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:26,501\nI've actually got a very small\npanel antenna I can put in here.\n\n1584\n01:21:26,501 --> 01:21:27,179\n>> Wow.\n>> And\n\n1585\n01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:31,492\nthat's directional so all it means is I\ngotta go someplace and just go, stick, and\n\n1586\n01:21:31,492 --> 01:21:34,588\nput it someplace and\nit's gonna give me even better range.\n\n1587\n01:21:34,588 --> 01:21:36,011\n>> Nice.\n>> Yeah, so yeah,\n\n1588\n01:21:36,011 --> 01:21:40,927\nvery dangerous to have something\nlike this, and the battery I have,\n\n1589\n01:21:40,927 --> 01:21:45,161\nwhich I don't have with me,\nI chose not to bring it with me,\n\n1590\n01:21:45,161 --> 01:21:49,176\nthe battery I have for\nit is about half the width of this.\n\n1591\n01:21:49,176 --> 01:21:52,580\nSo, about half the height of this thing,\nI guess.\n\n1592\n01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:55,460\nAnd, it's about the same shape.\n\n1593\n01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:56,060\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, I can\n\n1594\n01:21:56,060 --> 01:21:57,420\njust stick those things together.\n\n1595\n01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,229\nHeck, I'll duct tape or\nrubber band them together.\n\n1596\n01:21:59,229 --> 01:22:01,252\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Turn it on and it's boom, done.\n\n1597\n01:22:01,252 --> 01:22:02,337\n>> That is impressive.\n\n1598\n01:22:02,337 --> 01:22:02,970\n>> So.\n\n1599\n01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:05,013\n>> I like the comment\nJeff threw out there,\n\n1600\n01:22:05,013 --> 01:22:07,125\nwhy am I attaching to Wi-Fi Maui Hilton?\n\n1601\n01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:07,850\nI'm in Gainesville.\n\n1602\n01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:12,634\n[LAUGH] Your device is looking for\nthat network and oh look, there it is.\n\n1603\n01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:16,018\n>> Gotcha!\n>> [LAUGH] That's good, I liked that.\n\n1604\n01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:19,712\n[LAUGH]\n>> So it just shows you just how small and\n\n1605\n01:22:19,712 --> 01:22:21,472\ncompact these devices are.\n\n1606\n01:22:21,472 --> 01:22:25,742\nAnd just a little bit, trust me,\nthis is a little bit of what they can do.\n\n1607\n01:22:25,742 --> 01:22:28,752\nSo, what I've done here,\nin essence I've hit,\n\n1608\n01:22:28,752 --> 01:22:33,052\nwith one of these boxes, I can hit all\nthree categories of the CIA Triad.\n\n1609\n01:22:33,052 --> 01:22:35,972\nI can easily sniff your\ntraffic at this point.\n\n1610\n01:22:35,972 --> 01:22:41,390\nI can also, not just sniff it,\nI can alter it doing man-in-the-middle.\n\n1611\n01:22:41,390 --> 01:22:44,230\nOr I can just be a real jerk and\nI can sit here and\n\n1612\n01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:47,821\nturn this thing on and not connect\nit to anything and leave it there.\n\n1613\n01:22:47,821 --> 01:22:49,449\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's now a denial-of-service.\n\n1614\n01:22:49,449 --> 01:22:50,782\n>> Oh that's just wrong.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1615\n01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:51,665\n>> You will not go anywhere.\n\n1616\n01:22:51,665 --> 01:22:55,250\nIt will kill every wireless\nnetwork in the area.\n\n1617\n01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:57,910\nIf I wanted to kill every wireless\nnetwork in this building,\n\n1618\n01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:02,580\nthat's all I have to do is plug it in,\nturn on Karma, and just leave.\n\n1619\n01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,387\nDone.\n>> Cuz it's gonna start mimicking\n\n1620\n01:23:04,387 --> 01:23:06,530\nall the access points in the area.\n\n1621\n01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:09,630\nThe users are gonna end up probably\nswitching over to it at some point,\n\n1622\n01:23:09,630 --> 01:23:12,290\nespecially if I can put that in\na good place that has a better\n\n1623\n01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:14,353\nsignal than the legitimate access point.\n\n1624\n01:23:14,353 --> 01:23:17,840\nTheir computer is gonna automatically\nswitch over to it and then nothing,\n\n1625\n01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:18,830\ncuz it doesn't go anywhere.\n\n1626\n01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:20,300\n>> Yeah, once they're stuck here,\n\n1627\n01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:24,380\nand stuck in this, I guess you can\ncall it a tar pit at that point.\n\n1628\n01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:27,897\nOnce they're stuck in here, what's\nhappening is they're stuck connected\n\n1629\n01:23:27,897 --> 01:23:31,357\nto this, but as long as they don't put\nan Internet connection on this side,\n\n1630\n01:23:31,357 --> 01:23:32,946\nthey're stuck connecting to it.\n\n1631\n01:23:32,946 --> 01:23:34,746\nThey're gonna be hitting their browser and\nchecking their email,\n\n1632\n01:23:34,746 --> 01:23:36,268\nit's gonna say can't find server,\nor stuff like that.\n\n1633\n01:23:36,268 --> 01:23:40,358\nThey're gonna think the Internet's down\nand they're gonna be really ticked off and\n\n1634\n01:23:40,358 --> 01:23:44,410\ncontacting all these IT guys around\nhere telling them, your Internet sucks.\n\n1635\n01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,280\nNo, I took it out.\n\n1636\n01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:47,720\nThat's all it takes.\n\n1637\n01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:53,150\nSo something like this can be\na pretty funny, interesting tool.\n\n1638\n01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:53,990\nDid I say funny?\n\n1639\n01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:55,540\n>> Yeah.\n>> It could be an interesting tool.\n\n1640\n01:23:55,540 --> 01:23:58,070\n>> It could be funny if you're\nsitting back watching it-\n\n1641\n01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,570\n>> I couldn't help it.\n\n1642\n01:23:58,570 --> 01:24:00,430\n>> From the secret camera that\nyou have mounted up there.\n\n1643\n01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:01,270\n>> I couldn't help it.\n\n1644\n01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,300\nI'll admit that I did it one time,\n\n1645\n01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:07,217\njust as a social engineering test,\nduring the Super Bowl.\n\n1646\n01:24:07,217 --> 01:24:10,880\nI was trying to watch a hockey game,\nand don't interrupt my hockey games.\n\n1647\n01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,576\nThat's just a warning.\n\n1648\n01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:15,738\nSo I set up one of these honey\npots to see what happened and\n\n1649\n01:24:15,738 --> 01:24:20,466\nI redirected the the Patriots website to\nthe other guys, to the Seahawks website.\n\n1650\n01:24:20,466 --> 01:24:24,378\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then I directed all the major,\n\n1651\n01:24:24,378 --> 01:24:28,788\nanybody attached to this, the DNS\nresolved to, if you went to ESPN, ABC,\n\n1652\n01:24:28,788 --> 01:24:32,303\nor any of the sports sites,\nit went to mylittlepony.com.\n\n1653\n01:24:32,303 --> 01:24:34,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I'm a jerk, apparently.\n\n1654\n01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:36,580\nIt was funny.\n\n1655\n01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,540\n>> Controlled environment test,\nI think those are allowed.\n\n1656\n01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:42,760\n>> Yeah, it was a simple test, and the the\nthing is that we talked about that and\n\n1657\n01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:46,420\njust FYI, hey, it sounds like oh,\nwell that's unethical or anything.\n\n1658\n01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,920\nI say, I don't care what you think.\n\n1659\n01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,873\nNo, no.\n\n1660\n01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:52,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What is I say is, [LAUGH] all I'm doing\n\n1661\n01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:57,158\nis I'm turning this thing on in that case,\nI'm turning the thing on.\n\n1662\n01:24:57,158 --> 01:24:59,110\nI wasn't enticing anybody.\n\n1663\n01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:01,570\nIt wasn't mimicking any access point.\n\n1664\n01:25:01,570 --> 01:25:03,230\nI just stuck it out there.\n\n1665\n01:25:03,230 --> 01:25:07,750\nAnd I know that people are trained\nto look for access points.\n\n1666\n01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:12,380\nSo what was happening is people in the\nbars and stuff like that nearby were like,\n\n1667\n01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:14,950\noh, there's an open access point and\nthey're attaching to it.\n\n1668\n01:25:14,950 --> 01:25:16,574\nAnd I just happened to have\na little fun with them, so-\n\n1669\n01:25:16,574 --> 01:25:17,271\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1670\n01:25:17,271 --> 01:25:18,055\n>> That's why it's different,\n\n1671\n01:25:18,055 --> 01:25:18,722\nI didn't hack anything.\n\n1672\n01:25:18,722 --> 01:25:21,142\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All I did was just check my logs and\n\n1673\n01:25:21,142 --> 01:25:24,149\nI found out how many people had\nattached and I found it funny.\n\n1674\n01:25:24,149 --> 01:25:25,478\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah,\n\n1675\n01:25:25,478 --> 01:25:28,710\nI get amused by little things like that.\n\n1676\n01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:30,418\n>> That is good, that is good.\n\n1677\n01:25:30,418 --> 01:25:32,070\nAll right, well I'll tell you\nwhat ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1678\n01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:33,490\nIt's time for us to take a quick break.\n\n1679\n01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:35,970\nSo let us stop here and\n\n1680\n01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:39,340\nwhen we come back we're gonna continue\non with our wireless security.\n\n1681\n01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:40,430\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1682\n01:25:40,430 --> 01:25:41,126\nWe'll be right back.\n\n1683\n01:25:41,126 --> 01:25:48,144\n[SOUND]\nAll right,\n\n1684\n01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:49,392\nwelcome back ladies and gentlemen.\n\n1685\n01:25:49,392 --> 01:25:53,910\nDiving back into our Wireless Security or\nour Wireless Networks.\n\n1686\n01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:56,900\nGetting ready to show you some more\nfun stuff, I think, over here.\n\n1687\n01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:57,810\nSo, what's next Sean?\n\n1688\n01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:02,330\nWe took a look at that Pineapple,\nwhich really was pretty impressive.\n\n1689\n01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:05,830\nBeing able to grab all\nthe different beacons from all\n\n1690\n01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:08,100\nthe wireless clients in the area.\n\n1691\n01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,100\nSee what networks they connected to\nrecently, fake those networks or\n\n1692\n01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:14,950\nspoof those networks and\neven get them to connect to us,\n\n1693\n01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:18,480\nif they got that little pesky checkmark,\nremember this network selected.\n\n1694\n01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:22,320\nAnd then route all that traffic\nthrough us, and either do passive or\n\n1695\n01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:26,190\npossibly even get a little malicious and\ndo some active work with that data.\n\n1696\n01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,985\nVery impressive,\nhow you gonna to top that one?\n\n1697\n01:26:27,985 --> 01:26:30,770\n[Laugh]\n>> Well, we're gonna see about that.\n\n1698\n01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:33,331\nWe've got some other stuff still\nsitting in the bag over here.\n\n1699\n01:26:33,331 --> 01:26:35,794\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we have is,\n\n1700\n01:26:35,794 --> 01:26:40,054\nthe next thing I kinda want to\ntalk about is some more of those\n\n1701\n01:26:40,054 --> 01:26:44,506\nconfidentiality attacks and\ntargeting wireless networks.\n\n1702\n01:26:44,506 --> 01:26:48,852\nI mean, there's some ways we can\ntarget wireless networks and\n\n1703\n01:26:48,852 --> 01:26:50,747\nfind out what's going on.\n\n1704\n01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:55,150\nOne of them goes back to\nthe confidentiality part is talking about\n\n1705\n01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:57,804\nWireshark from earlier on in the week.\n\n1706\n01:26:57,804 --> 01:27:00,940\nWireshark is still in play.\n\n1707\n01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:05,740\nLike I said, we're not done with\nthat by any means at this point.\n\n1708\n01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:08,030\nSo Wireshark,\nwe're gonna bring it back into play, but\n\n1709\n01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:10,650\nwe're gonna bring it back\ninto play with a new twist.\n\n1710\n01:27:10,650 --> 01:27:15,660\nWhat I have done here is,\nI have two of these devices sitting here.\n\n1711\n01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:18,140\nWe can just go on the big screen for\nthat one.\n\n1712\n01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,450\nI have two of these devices here.\n\n1713\n01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:22,540\nOne I've got plugged in.\n\n1714\n01:27:22,540 --> 01:27:25,110\nThis one I'm holding,\nthe other one's a little newer.\n\n1715\n01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:31,120\nThis is AirPcap, so\nthis is an AirPcap Classic.\n\n1716\n01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:34,940\nI have an AirPcap Tx plugged in.\n\n1717\n01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,565\nThis one doesn't do packet injection,\nthe Tx does.\n\n1718\n01:27:39,565 --> 01:27:42,589\nAnd packet injection is what's gonna allow\nme to do things like break WEP keys and\n\n1719\n01:27:42,589 --> 01:27:43,265\nstuff like that.\n\n1720\n01:27:43,265 --> 01:27:48,156\nCuz it allows me to place packets on the\nnetwork to induce all sorts of things and\n\n1721\n01:27:48,156 --> 01:27:48,981\nbehaviors.\n\n1722\n01:27:48,981 --> 01:27:54,264\nSo the question is that why would you even\ncare about having a device like this?\n\n1723\n01:27:54,264 --> 01:27:58,242\nWell, you care because if you\nplug something like this in And\n\n1724\n01:27:58,242 --> 01:28:02,610\non a Windows platform, and\nyou've got Wireshark installed, and\n\n1725\n01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:07,940\nyou install the Airpcap drivers,\nyou get what I have on my screen.\n\n1726\n01:28:07,940 --> 01:28:12,130\nWe'll see on my screen here\nis I have Wireshark running.\n\n1727\n01:28:12,130 --> 01:28:15,310\nWireshark if you take a look at it,\nlooks kind of somewhat\n\n1728\n01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:20,260\nvaguely resembles what we saw earlier on,\nin our travels and sniffing and all that.\n\n1729\n01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,480\nBut if you look closer,\n\n1730\n01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:26,310\nyou're gonna see that it's actually\nnot the same type of stuff.\n\n1731\n01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:33,114\nWhat I've done in this case,\nis I started up a Wireshark and\n\n1732\n01:28:33,114 --> 01:28:39,930\nwhen it asked me for the adapter to\nchoose, I chose the Airpcap adapter.\n\n1733\n01:28:39,930 --> 01:28:44,630\nAnd what that does is it allows me to\nget deeper hardware level information,\n\n1734\n01:28:44,630 --> 01:28:49,040\nthen I would just by using Wireshark\nwith a normal wireless adapter.\n\n1735\n01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,620\nYeah, so what I'm seeing here is if you\nlook over all the way in that last column,\n\n1736\n01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:57,740\nyou can start seeing some of\nthe interesting things that I have there.\n\n1737\n01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:02,710\nIf we can zoom up a bit more, we can see\nsome of the things that are happening.\n\n1738\n01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:06,108\nNotice in that last column over here,\nwhat are we getting?\n\n1739\n01:29:06,108 --> 01:29:11,300\nThese actually are SSID's of networks and\nI can scroll down that list,\n\n1740\n01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:17,848\nand I can see other SSID's actually show\nup for different devices, pop it in.\n\n1741\n01:29:17,848 --> 01:29:22,020\nThese are pro-requests and other things,\ncoming out of devices in the area.\n\n1742\n01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:24,800\nAnd so it's telling me that,\nheck, they're here.\n\n1743\n01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:27,950\nI just did a quick look around.\n\n1744\n01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:32,650\nYou can see there's your\ndata being transmitted.\n\n1745\n01:29:32,650 --> 01:29:35,040\nI can see these beacon frames being,\ngoing around.\n\n1746\n01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:38,650\nHere's something that's\ninteresting with this,\n\n1747\n01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:43,560\nis how you can use something like this,\nis that I have this ARP cap\n\n1748\n01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:48,400\ndevice plugged in here and\nit's reading these beaconing frames.\n\n1749\n01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:51,586\nThese guys are looking for those networks.\n\n1750\n01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:56,070\nOr that network is itself is\nbroadcasting the fact that it's there.\n\n1751\n01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:01,280\nIf I go through this list, what if someone\nis using something like Mac filtering?\n\n1752\n01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,840\nTo preserve the integrity and\nconfidentiality of the network and\n\n1753\n01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,430\ntrying to keep people off of it.\n\n1754\n01:30:07,430 --> 01:30:12,120\nThey're saying I'm gonna\nget your Mac address and\n\n1755\n01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:17,460\nlog it on my access point and anybody\nthat's not in that list can't get in.\n\n1756\n01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:19,800\nThat's an easy enough problem to solve.\n\n1757\n01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,350\nI turn this on.\n\n1758\n01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:24,800\nI let it kind of sit around there for\na while, read beacon requests and\n\n1759\n01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,410\nwhen I see a beacon request,\nor a probe request, come out.\n\n1760\n01:30:27,410 --> 01:30:29,350\nAnd you'll see some\nprobe requests come out.\n\n1761\n01:30:29,350 --> 01:30:31,183\nAnd it's looking for that SSID.\n\n1762\n01:30:31,183 --> 01:30:34,400\nAll I have to do is say okay,\nthat's the one I wanna attach to,\n\n1763\n01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:39,240\nthat one's trying to attach to it,\nand so it may very well be authorized.\n\n1764\n01:30:39,240 --> 01:30:42,840\nWhat I'll do is, I'll just,\nI got the information being held here.\n\n1765\n01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:45,720\nI'll just read that Mac address\noff the screen that its got.\n\n1766\n01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:50,070\nTake that MAC address, spoof it on mine,\nwhich is a skill we've already learned,\n\n1767\n01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:53,070\ndump it in there and now this one\nwill attach that access point.\n\n1768\n01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:56,060\nI've just bypassed your MAC\nfiltering in short order.\n\n1769\n01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:58,860\n>> Yeah, that's pretty,\nI think we alluded to it earlier.\n\n1770\n01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:01,980\nI don't know if we ever got back around\nto it, but that's two of the things that\n\n1771\n01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:04,920\nyou'll read in like some of\nyour basic security classes.\n\n1772\n01:31:04,920 --> 01:31:07,850\nThey're always gonna talk about when\nyou're securing that wireless network,\n\n1773\n01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:13,630\nto disable the broadcast to the SSID,\nand maybe do MAC filtering.\n\n1774\n01:31:13,630 --> 01:31:14,250\nThe problem is,\n\n1775\n01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:17,630\nboth of those bits of information is\nout in the header of that packet.\n\n1776\n01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:20,940\nSo whether it's encrypted or not,\nthat information is plain text.\n\n1777\n01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:23,180\nAnd that is what Shaun\nwas alluding to earlier.\n\n1778\n01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:25,540\nYou can hide your SSID if you want.\n\n1779\n01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:29,110\nit won't show up on my list of\nnetworks to connect to, sure, but\n\n1780\n01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:32,710\nanybody that knows what they're doing,\nall they gotta do is break out any kind of\n\n1781\n01:31:32,710 --> 01:31:38,450\nwireless packet capture utility, capture a\nfew packets, and you're gonna see the SSID\n\n1782\n01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:43,400\nas well as the MAC address of\nthe device that's connecting.\n\n1783\n01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:49,150\n>> Yeah, things like cloaking or\nhiding SSID and doing MAC filtering.\n\n1784\n01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:52,180\nYou're just running, I'm gonna catch you.\n\n1785\n01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:54,890\n>> Yeah right?\n>> I mean, it's like, you can run, but\n\n1786\n01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:55,860\nyou'll die tired.\n\n1787\n01:31:55,860 --> 01:31:57,050\nThat's what's gonna happen.\n\n1788\n01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:02,210\n>> I honestly think sometimes that if\nyou turn off the SSID broadcast, it ends\n\n1789\n01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:06,860\nup making more work on the administrative\nend than it does anything for security.\n\n1790\n01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:10,760\nBecause now I've got to manually enter\nthe SSID on the different devices.\n\n1791\n01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:13,830\nI might be able to use a policy here or\nthere to push that out, but\n\n1792\n01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:16,990\nwhen visitors come,\nvendors, what have you,\n\n1793\n01:32:16,990 --> 01:32:21,810\nnew clients on the network,\nI've gotta update my MAC filtering list.\n\n1794\n01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:24,420\nSo in the end,\nthat's something you get to decide.\n\n1795\n01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,620\nYour company might say,\nI still want to implement it.\n\n1796\n01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:31,760\nBecause it is still effective for keeping\nthe honest people honest, but in the end,\n\n1797\n01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:35,420\nit's not the security you think you're\ngetting I think a lot of times.\n\n1798\n01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,670\n>> Yeah, it's just not.\n\n1799\n01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:42,720\nAnd this is why your pen testing skills\nare so valuable is that you may not have\n\n1800\n01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:48,030\nhad an understanding of this as well,\nbefore I did this.\n\n1801\n01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:49,959\nWho knows, you might have.\n\n1802\n01:32:49,959 --> 01:32:54,430\nYou still have some exploring to do\nway beyond what I can teach you here,\n\n1803\n01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,440\njust in the time we have.\n\n1804\n01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,400\nBut do some exploring.\n\n1805\n01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:03,090\nOnce you refine your skills, you realize\nwhat works in wireless security, and\n\n1806\n01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:06,420\nwhat is kind of like,\nit's a security blanket.\n\n1807\n01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,900\nIt's not really doing much more,\nsecurity theater, as they sometimes say,\n\n1808\n01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:13,350\nbecause the appearance of it,\nbut it's not really there.\n\n1809\n01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:15,770\nSo just FYI on that.\n\n1810\n01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:20,200\nAnd for you guys that have these things.\n\n1811\n01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:22,330\nI really should.\n\n1812\n01:33:22,330 --> 01:33:23,990\nThey said earlier.\n\n1813\n01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:25,285\nI should sell stuff.\n\n1814\n01:33:25,285 --> 01:33:27,440\n[LAUGH] I really could do this.\n\n1815\n01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:30,020\nI have a url on here.\n\n1816\n01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,620\nIf I had kids they'd be\nthrough college right now so\n\n1817\n01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:33,780\n>> I don't know about you guys out there\n\n1818\n01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:37,770\nin TV land, but\nI personally would buy a Airpcap\n\n1819\n01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:41,478\ndevice that had the Oriyono brand on it\n>> Who wouldn't?\n\n1820\n01:33:41,478 --> 01:33:46,135\n[LAUGH] I feel like we should\nbe zooming in right now, and\n\n1821\n01:33:46,135 --> 01:33:49,681\nI should be going Airpcap, for\nthe professional pen tester.\n\n1822\n01:33:49,681 --> 01:33:51,909\n>> [LAUGH] That was good!\n\n1823\n01:33:51,909 --> 01:33:54,705\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, if you need one of these things,\n\n1824\n01:33:54,705 --> 01:33:56,282\nyes, these things are expensive.\n\n1825\n01:33:57,762 --> 01:34:00,592\nI'm well aware of that.\n\n1826\n01:34:00,592 --> 01:34:03,954\nIf you don't have the budget\nto buy a new one, get to eBay.\n\n1827\n01:34:03,954 --> 01:34:06,612\nYou're gonna get in a bidding war,\njust be prepared for that.\n\n1828\n01:34:06,612 --> 01:34:09,617\nUnless you can do a buy it now,\nand get it right away.\n\n1829\n01:34:09,617 --> 01:34:13,402\nAnd,I recommend you do your research to\nfind out what you should be paying for\n\n1830\n01:34:13,402 --> 01:34:14,880\nthis thing brand new.\n\n1831\n01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,830\nAnd if you can get it cheaper than that,\nyou get a buy it now, do it.\n\n1832\n01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:22,218\nBecause these things are a valuable\ndevice and they seem to always be great.\n\n1833\n01:34:22,218 --> 01:34:26,980\nBut like I said,\n\n1834\n01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:31,940\nyou can get them off eBay or you can buy\nthem brand new, but they aren't cheap.\n\n1835\n01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:34,450\nThis one right here is about,\nI think it's a 200, 300.\n\n1836\n01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:38,420\nThe one I have plugged in is,\nI believe is about 700.\n\n1837\n01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:41,558\n>> Anything they can do of active\nstuff is gonna be more expensive and\n\n1838\n01:34:41,558 --> 01:34:43,280\nthen it's that later model, too.\n\n1839\n01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,070\nI know we had a good question.\n\n1840\n01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:46,250\nMichaela asked,\n\n1841\n01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:50,870\nyeah I had a pentest reports recommending\nthat we use obviscating on the SSID.\n\n1842\n01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:52,080\nDon't really see the point.\n\n1843\n01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:53,030\nIs there any?\n\n1844\n01:34:53,030 --> 01:34:54,710\nAnd I think that's kinda\nwhat we were just saying,\n\n1845\n01:34:54,710 --> 01:34:58,510\nis it might make people feel better about\nthe security of their wireless network.\n\n1846\n01:34:58,510 --> 01:35:02,580\nIt might keep the honest people honest\nby hiding that SSID, but in the end,\n\n1847\n01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,700\nit's a lot more administrative effort.\n\n1848\n01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:06,560\nBecause you've got to do\neverything manually or\n\n1849\n01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:10,820\nvia policies, if you can push that\nout in like a Windows environment.\n\n1850\n01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:13,450\nBut when people bring in new devices,\nthey're gonna have to manually enter it,\n\n1851\n01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:15,110\nmeans they're going to be,\nhey, where's that SSID?\n\n1852\n01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:19,470\nPeople are either gonna be hauling\nit out or sending it via email.\n\n1853\n01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:22,110\nAnd in the end,\na simple tool like this, or\n\n1854\n01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:26,760\njust Wireshark, which is a free tool\ncan find that SSID if I really need it.\n\n1855\n01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,170\nSo, if it's a company regulation,\nif it's an industry regulation, or\n\n1856\n01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:33,820\nsomething like that, you gotta do it.\n\n1857\n01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:35,820\nMy personal opinion,\nI think Shaun's on the same boat,\n\n1858\n01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:37,480\nis it's probably not worth it.\n\n1859\n01:35:37,480 --> 01:35:39,880\nYeah, you make your own choice.\n\n1860\n01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:44,100\nMike and I are telling you\nour opinions on the stuff.\n\n1861\n01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:46,732\nI'm in total agreement with Mike on that,\n\n1862\n01:35:46,732 --> 01:35:49,990\njust don't, it's really not worth it,\ndoing these things.\n\n1863\n01:35:49,990 --> 01:35:52,500\nThere's other overhead and stuff.\n\n1864\n01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,762\nI mean yeah you can make cases to me\nall day that yeah I want to do this and\n\n1865\n01:35:55,762 --> 01:35:56,567\nblah blah blah.\n\n1866\n01:35:56,567 --> 01:35:57,763\nI'm not gonna say you're wrong.\n\n1867\n01:35:57,763 --> 01:36:00,517\nIf you find a way to justify and\nyou like doing that,\n\n1868\n01:36:00,517 --> 01:36:02,452\nyou like to do things the wrong way.\n\n1869\n01:36:02,452 --> 01:36:03,797\nNobody's through no you\nfeel like doing things.\n\n1870\n01:36:03,797 --> 01:36:08,048\n[LAUGH]\n>> I love that I got a coworker you\n\n1871\n01:36:08,048 --> 01:36:11,377\nguys have probably seen some of\nthe episodes with Mr. Don Pezet,\n\n1872\n01:36:11,377 --> 01:36:15,234\nhe's got that famous saying you can do\nit that way if you want it not to work.\n\n1873\n01:36:15,234 --> 01:36:18,870\n[LAUGH].\nBut in this case, no, it will still work,\n\n1874\n01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:20,190\nwe're just teasing with you.\n\n1875\n01:36:20,190 --> 01:36:22,550\n>> Yeah, we can use,\nMike's telling you hey,\n\n1876\n01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:27,970\nwell it's gonna take more administer\noverhead, that's absolutely true.\n\n1877\n01:36:27,970 --> 01:36:31,130\nIf you're okay with the extra overhead\nthat goes to having to deal with people\n\n1878\n01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:32,120\ngoing what's our network again?\n\n1879\n01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:34,130\nWhy can't I see it and blah, blah, blah.\n\n1880\n01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:36,270\nYou're fine with that, they go for it.\n\n1881\n01:36:36,270 --> 01:36:38,430\nWhen someone in here said\nthey'd use a hidden one,\n\n1882\n01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:41,450\nso he doesn't keep them as cluttered-\n>> That's a great idea.\n\n1883\n01:36:41,450 --> 01:36:43,860\n>> You found a justification for\nit, I'm not gonna sit here and say,\n\n1884\n01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,870\noh well you're stupid for\ndoing that, no fine.\n\n1885\n01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:48,730\nYou found a reason for it, it works.\n\n1886\n01:36:48,730 --> 01:36:53,720\nBut we also know, that before\nby what you've seen so far, and\n\n1887\n01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:56,420\nwe got plenty more coming up.\n\n1888\n01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:00,350\nWe know that's not a way to hide,\nthat's not an effective way to hide,\n\n1889\n01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:01,370\nI will find you.\n\n1890\n01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:04,980\n>> Yeah, so if you're using it to keep\nthat list for being uncluttered, great,\n\n1891\n01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:08,080\nas long as you understand that you're\nnot really getting a lot of security\n\n1892\n01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:10,320\nout of that method, I think you're okay.\n\n1893\n01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,320\nWhich is with anything, right?\n\n1894\n01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,640\nAnything we implement or\n\n1895\n01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:15,440\nchoose not to do when we're\nmitigating those risks or doing that.\n\n1896\n01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,190\nRisk analysis.\n\n1897\n01:37:16,190 --> 01:37:18,180\nWe're trying to decide is the cost or\n\n1898\n01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:23,670\neffort worth the risk that I face or\nthe vulnerability that I might expose?\n\n1899\n01:37:23,670 --> 01:37:26,020\nAnother question really quick\nwhile we're stopped here.\n\n1900\n01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:29,770\nWilliam asks if\nan enterprise environment is\n\n1901\n01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:35,100\nrequiring certs and\nnetwork authentication.\n\n1902\n01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:40,850\nAnd network authentication\nis that reasonably secure.\n\n1903\n01:37:40,850 --> 01:37:43,000\n>> You mean layering\nthat on top of wireless,\n\n1904\n01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,700\nyou know using both digital certificates\nand doing network level authentication.\n\n1905\n01:37:47,730 --> 01:37:51,780\nLike an app or something like that?\n\n1906\n01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:53,980\n>> And I know we've got a little\ndelay there so we'll wait for\n\n1907\n01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:56,580\nWilliam to kinda,\nask us that question again William.\n\n1908\n01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:59,720\nTry again and\nwe'll make sure we get you that answer.\n\n1909\n01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:02,033\n>> Rephrase that in\nthe form of a question.\n\n1910\n01:38:02,033 --> 01:38:06,230\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think I know what you're saying but\n\n1911\n01:38:06,230 --> 01:38:09,060\nI want to make sure we've got\nit correct there before we.\n\n1912\n01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:12,370\nThrow out some answers so.\n\n1913\n01:38:12,370 --> 01:38:14,740\nLet's see where we're headed next.\n\n1914\n01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:17,610\nConfidentiality, we talked\nabout those kinds of attacks.\n\n1915\n01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:20,190\nIntegrity kind of falls\nalong the same lines there.\n\n1916\n01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:24,470\n>> Yeah, there's still plenty of\nattacks in all those categories.\n\n1917\n01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:27,450\nI mean I've been able to find\na wireless access point.\n\n1918\n01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:31,940\nThere's things like evil twin attacks\nwhere someone sets up an access point that\n\n1919\n01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:33,480\nlooks similar to another one.\n\n1920\n01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:39,579\nYou know, it kind of acts as\na social engineering Type attack.\n\n1921\n01:38:39,579 --> 01:38:46,700\nSo I think of it as the evil twin or\nsometimes I call it the rogue attack.\n\n1922\n01:38:46,700 --> 01:38:50,970\nI've mentioned, a little bit of bragging,\nI mentioned that.\n\n1923\n01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:57,890\nBut I think of this situation they had in\nHawaii, because they had the Doubletree.\n\n1924\n01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,740\nAnd this is where I first ran into it.\n\n1925\n01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:03,020\nAnd it put the idea in my head is that\n\n1926\n01:39:03,020 --> 01:39:05,700\nthey have this hotel\nright there Doubletree.\n\n1927\n01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:07,300\nWhich is you know, it's a national brand.\n\n1928\n01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,030\nBut they've got one there.\n\n1929\n01:39:09,030 --> 01:39:10,860\nAnd then they've got, you know,\n\n1930\n01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:16,450\nthis Hilton Hawaiian village in Oahu,\ntoo, and the average\n\n1931\n01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:21,190\nperson doesn't really know that those\nare both owned by the same company, okay?\n\n1932\n01:39:21,190 --> 01:39:22,500\nNow, why does that matter?\n\n1933\n01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:27,230\nWell, because when the access point that's\nused for the Hilton is called HHonors,\n\n1934\n01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:30,890\nwhich is a loyalty program\nDoubleTree's part of the Hilton Chain.\n\n1935\n01:39:30,890 --> 01:39:32,700\nWhat's the name of its access point?\n\n1936\n01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:33,940\nH honors.\n\n1937\n01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:36,060\nOkay?\nIt doesn't seem like there's any,\n\n1938\n01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:41,310\nyou might be seeing where I'm going, you\nmight not, but in my mind I could go in\n\n1939\n01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:46,855\nthat hotel with something like a pineapple\nor any type of Axis plant at this point.\n\n1940\n01:39:46,855 --> 01:39:49,715\nI'll just pop in my own access point and\ncall it Doubletree.\n\n1941\n01:39:49,715 --> 01:39:52,755\nNow you tell me which one\npeople are going to attach to.\n\n1942\n01:39:52,755 --> 01:39:55,885\n>> If I'm staying at Doubletree and\nI see H-Rewards and Doubletree,\n\n1943\n01:39:55,885 --> 01:39:58,870\nI'm clicking on Doubletree\n>> Yeah it makes total sense its the name\n\n1944\n01:39:58,870 --> 01:40:01,210\nof the hotel that your staying at and\n\n1945\n01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:04,060\nmost people when they're going\nto a hotel aren't signing in and\n\n1946\n01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:06,860\nwhen their signing their paper work\nto go in there not looking around\n\n1947\n01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:10,370\nlike there's the name of the access\npoint they don't look at it in the room.\n\n1948\n01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:16,030\nThey just turn it on and there you go\nclick to it that's what they do I'm doing\n\n1949\n01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:20,960\nplain and simple ya know understanding and\ngoing back to social engineering element\n\n1950\n01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:25,930\nI'm understanding what people are going\nto do what their lazy sides going to do\n\n1951\n01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:29,620\nwhat they're going to do to make things\neasy on them what they're trained to do.\n\n1952\n01:40:29,620 --> 01:40:31,200\nAnd I am preying upon that and\n\n1953\n01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:35,430\nuse that behavior to get\nthem to where I want to go.\n\n1954\n01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:39,998\n>> Right, and to go back real quick before\nwe forget I think it was William that had\n\n1955\n01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:44,700\nthat, I'm lost again.\n\n1956\n01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:47,180\nSo is it reasonably secure to\nset up an enterprise wireless\n\n1957\n01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:49,360\nrequiring both certs and\nnetwork identification.\n\n1958\n01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:54,540\nAnd I was saying layers of\nsecurity is what it's all about so\n\n1959\n01:40:54,540 --> 01:40:57,120\nyou've got a way to implement search.\n\n1960\n01:40:57,120 --> 01:41:00,630\nI'm not sure never been an occasion for\nsearch.\n\n1961\n01:41:00,630 --> 01:41:04,165\nWe're using search for\nthe network of medication or anyway.\n\n1962\n01:41:04,165 --> 01:41:08,655\nYes and any time I can put more\nthan one layer of security in there\n\n1963\n01:41:08,655 --> 01:41:10,895\nthat's most likely going\nto be a good thing.\n\n1964\n01:41:10,895 --> 01:41:14,145\nIt does make it more complex you know we\ntalked about that sliding scale between\n\n1965\n01:41:14,145 --> 01:41:15,995\ninconvenience and security.\n\n1966\n01:41:15,995 --> 01:41:21,445\nBut more layers is better than a single\nlayer and somebody asked about radius.\n\n1967\n01:41:21,445 --> 01:41:24,035\nWhich I think we'll talk about\nprobably towards the end of this,\n\n1968\n01:41:24,035 --> 01:41:27,015\nwhen we talk about ways to protect but\nwe mentioned earlier.\n\n1969\n01:41:27,015 --> 01:41:30,330\nYou know radius which we mentioned\nearlier remote authentication,\n\n1970\n01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:36,060\ndialing user service, or also known as\n802.1x, which is the IEEE standard for it.\n\n1971\n01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:40,970\nMoves the authentication process\noff of either the 802.1x\n\n1972\n01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,430\nenabled wireless access point,\nor switch for that matter.\n\n1973\n01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:47,660\nYou know we know that\nthese access points don't\n\n1974\n01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:49,340\nhave the best authentication methods.\n\n1975\n01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:52,440\nIf I can move that back to a RADIUS\nservice, gonna be a good thing but.\n\n1976\n01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,890\nMore about that towards the end, probably.\n\n1977\n01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:58,890\nLet's continue on with some of these\nattacks, here, before we get there.\n\n1978\n01:41:58,890 --> 01:42:03,160\n>> Yeah, we kind of mentioned some of\nthese different things, but let's,\n\n1979\n01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:10,570\nthis one is actually a good one for\nyou, I know I was looking at this one.\n\n1980\n01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:14,800\nCan be a way security-- admins\ncan be lured to rogue access\n\n1981\n01:42:16,810 --> 01:42:17,670\npoints\n>> Right\n\n1982\n01:42:17,670 --> 01:42:20,645\n>> Haven't you been paying attention?\n\n1983\n01:42:20,645 --> 01:42:24,030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Now that's a great question James,\n\n1984\n01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:27,230\nthere's some really good ways to do that.\n\n1985\n01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:30,950\nYou could use some of\nthe stuff we're using here.\n\n1986\n01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:32,650\nYou could use definitely to pick that up.\n\n1987\n01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:35,370\nThose things have to put out information.\n\n1988\n01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:40,560\nThe WiFi pineapple could pick it up,\nAirPcap could pick it up.\n\n1989\n01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,510\nBut then we also have other things too.\n\n1990\n01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:48,070\nIf we look over my at\nsecond computer here.\n\n1991\n01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:50,739\nYou gave me a great entry for\nthis James so I appreciate it.\n\n1992\n01:42:50,739 --> 01:42:52,230\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> If you look over here on my\n\n1993\n01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:57,150\nsecond computer here,\nthis is something called YSpy.\n\n1994\n01:42:57,150 --> 01:43:01,060\nAnd what this is doing,\nthis is actually monitoring in real time.\n\n1995\n01:43:01,060 --> 01:43:06,220\nYou may see a little bit of a delay\nhere cause of the weather on this, but\n\n1996\n01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:09,190\nwhat it's doing you can\nsee across the top.\n\n1997\n01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:13,010\nThat's actually showing\na spectrum analysis of\n\n1998\n01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:17,760\nthe different frequencies in this area and\nthen at the bottom-- right\n\n1999\n01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,570\nunderneath that-- it's showing how those\nfrequencies kind of stack up over time.\n\n2000\n01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:23,180\nAnd then the left hand side,\n\n2001\n01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:28,240\nthat waterfall diagram, is kind of showing\nhow the frequencies relate to one another.\n\n2002\n01:43:28,240 --> 01:43:29,800\nAnd I can filter that out.\n\n2003\n01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,670\nIf I click on any of those buttons\ndown there towards the bottom,\n\n2004\n01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:38,750\nif I click on any of these networks\ndown there, you'll actually see that\n\n2005\n01:43:38,750 --> 01:43:43,890\nthey will kinda start\nsingling out networks for us.\n\n2006\n01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:49,640\nIt'll tell us, okay, I found this and this\nand this, looking at something like this,\n\n2007\n01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:54,612\nyou know I have an adapter plugged into\nit I don't know if we have the overhead\n\n2008\n01:43:54,612 --> 01:43:58,837\nhooked up on this one but\nif we speed the adaptor up that's fine.\n\n2009\n01:43:58,837 --> 01:44:04,374\nThe adaptor is the small usb adaptor\nwith an antennae about yay big.\n\n2010\n01:44:04,374 --> 01:44:09,463\nAnd about the size I was holding up\nearlier, an antennae about this size,\n\n2011\n01:44:09,463 --> 01:44:13,740\nand it can pick up things\nacross the whole spectrum.\n\n2012\n01:44:13,740 --> 01:44:16,090\nIt can do a lot of neat stuff.\n\n2013\n01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:17,070\nUnder the right conditions,\n\n2014\n01:44:17,070 --> 01:44:20,480\nthis can even pick up those\nBluetooth headsets and everything.\n\n2015\n01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,110\nIt can really start\npulling at all that data,\n\n2016\n01:44:22,110 --> 01:44:25,890\nand it can help you spot interference and\nthings that are suspect.\n\n2017\n01:44:25,890 --> 01:44:28,380\nAnd then you could start\nnarrowing it down, saying yeah,\n\n2018\n01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:33,321\nthere is a hidden access point there,\nand then these guys medigeek\n\n2019\n01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:38,390\nactually also sells something called\ninsider, which you can plug into a gps,\n\n2020\n01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:41,530\nand they have it available for\ncellphones too for free.\n\n2021\n01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:45,653\nYou can use your cellphone and\nwalk around and do this type of stuff, and\n\n2022\n01:44:45,653 --> 01:44:49,050\nstart picking up all sorts\nof access points with it.\n\n2023\n01:44:49,050 --> 01:44:50,260\nYou know so there's plenty of ways.\n\n2024\n01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:53,840\nThere's also Kizmet which is another\none would allow you to attach rogue\n\n2025\n01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:56,400\naccess points and track them.\n\n2026\n01:44:56,400 --> 01:45:00,050\nAnd then if you really want to spend\nthe big bucks they've got stuff like air\n\n2027\n01:45:00,050 --> 01:45:03,220\nmagnet, which you know kind\nof the big boys on the block.\n\n2028\n01:45:03,220 --> 01:45:06,140\nYou will be paying through the nose for\nit but\n\n2029\n01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:11,200\nit gives a whole another level of\nstuff and it put error magnet in.\n\n2030\n01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:14,340\nYou can put several sensors\naround the building and\n\n2031\n01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:17,340\nwhat happens is when you put those, when\nyou put those things, those little sensors\n\n2032\n01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,980\naround the building, if you were to turn\non a wireless device, it will be boom.\n\n2033\n01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:26,030\nIt will pick it up and something like\nthis, has a console kind of sort of like\n\n2034\n01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:29,030\nthis, it will pick that up and\nsay, hey I've got ya.\n\n2035\n01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:33,358\n>> I promise that link is good,\nit looks ugly but it's safe.\n\n2036\n01:45:33,358 --> 01:45:37,223\n>> A lot of different tools we can use\nto find those rogue access points.\n\n2037\n01:45:37,223 --> 01:45:39,068\nYou're basically doing a wireless survey.\n\n2038\n01:45:39,068 --> 01:45:43,525\nSomething the company should be doing on a\nregular basis to make sure they don't have\n\n2039\n01:45:43,525 --> 01:45:47,794\nthose rogue access points popping up here\nand there to make sure that the coverage\n\n2040\n01:45:47,794 --> 01:45:52,280\nis adequate and that we're not missing any\ncorners or offices and things like that.\n\n2041\n01:45:52,280 --> 01:45:56,834\nSo any of those types of tools that we can\nuse to do a wireless survey that is going\n\n2042\n01:45:56,834 --> 01:46:02,070\nto help us with finding this rogue access\npoint, so lots of choices there really.\n\n2043\n01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:07,410\n>> Yea, it's, there really are,\nthere's a lot of devices that they use for\n\n2044\n01:46:07,410 --> 01:46:11,060\nsome of these attacks,\nlike the war attacks, the war driving and\n\n2045\n01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:14,950\nstuff like that, they are specifically.\n\n2046\n01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:20,270\n>> That they can be specifically used for\ndetecting wireless devices and\n\n2047\n01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:25,360\nrogue access points, or you can use\nthem for the malicious side too.\n\n2048\n01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:29,560\nBut you can use them to narrow down where\nyour wireless access points are and\n\n2049\n01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:31,650\nyour wireless devices are.\n\n2050\n01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:36,490\nSo you've got so many options in that\ncategory to find them if you want.\n\n2051\n01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:42,430\nAnd then some of them are really good,\nthey can detect power, how many clients\n\n2052\n01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:46,270\nare attached, how long it's been online,\neven the manufacturer in a lot of cases.\n\n2053\n01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:49,655\nYou know, so they can pick up\na tremendous amount of information.\n\n2054\n01:46:49,655 --> 01:46:55,450\n>> Mm-hm, and I know I saw in the chatroom\nsomebody mentioned Fluke another\n\n2055\n01:46:55,450 --> 01:46:59,080\ncompany that makes a lot\nof really cool equipment.\n\n2056\n01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:02,150\nSome of it's more with\nthe medical industry.\n\n2057\n01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:04,400\nBut they have a lot of\nwireless stuff as well.\n\n2058\n01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:07,540\nI'll throw out a link if you guys\nare just curious and want to go browse.\n\n2059\n01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:10,860\nBut they got some good stuff there too,\nexpensive.\n\n2060\n01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:13,665\n>> Yeah you're going to pay for\nsome of this stuff yeah.\n\n2061\n01:47:13,665 --> 01:47:17,630\n>> [LAUGH] I remember we got a, I forget\nwhat I did with fluke I think I had\n\n2062\n01:47:17,630 --> 01:47:20,810\nregistered on their site to get\nsome information or something and\n\n2063\n01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:24,900\nin the promotional material they sent\nback was they you open up this box and\n\n2064\n01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,880\nit looked just like I was like\nholy they sent me a fluke you\n\n2065\n01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:31,860\nknow device here I go to pick it up and\nit was just a cardboard cutout with a very\n\n2066\n01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:34,452\nphotorealistic picture\non it of this device.\n\n2067\n01:47:34,452 --> 01:47:35,308\n>> [LAUGH] Sike!\n\n2068\n01:47:35,308 --> 01:47:37,024\n>> Oh, that's what you get for free.\n\n2069\n01:47:37,024 --> 01:47:37,552\nYeah, okay.\n\n2070\n01:47:37,552 --> 01:47:39,480\n[LAUGH]\n>> Suitable for framing.\n\n2071\n01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:41,740\n>> Yes, absolutely, absolutely.\n\n2072\n01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:45,970\n>> This is, just FYI,\nI stopped the actual scanner\n\n2073\n01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:49,150\n>> Over here, this is Wi-Spy,\n\n2074\n01:47:49,150 --> 01:47:53,120\nthis is what I have plugged in that was\nworking with that channelizer software\n\n2075\n01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:56,140\nthat I saw someone bring up the name.\n\n2076\n01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:58,950\nThat's all it does,\nthis Windows multi-frequency.\n\n2077\n01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:02,190\nSo, you know, you can do a good\nnumber of things with this, too.\n\n2078\n01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:07,040\nIt's, technically, this is designed\nto optimize your network and\n\n2079\n01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:11,080\ndo things like that, but\nI'm just repurposing it for other things.\n\n2080\n01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:14,490\n>> All right, Sean, well, what else do we,\ndo we want to hit anything else today?\n\n2081\n01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:17,112\nWe are getting close on our time.\n\n2082\n01:48:17,112 --> 01:48:20,860\n>> I think we got a good number\nof things under our belt.\n\n2083\n01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:26,090\nWe got a nice, it can leave some\nmore surprises until later,\n\n2084\n01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:28,930\ncuz I've got a lot of stuff in my toy box.\n\n2085\n01:48:28,930 --> 01:48:32,299\n>> He's got a bag of tools behind me that\nI'm just dying for him to break out here.\n\n2086\n01:48:32,299 --> 01:48:35,840\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, this is definitely going\nto be a two parter ladies and gentlemen.\n\n2087\n01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,787\n>> Yeah, I've got stuff like\ntoys here to bring out.\n\n2088\n01:48:38,787 --> 01:48:40,667\n>> Wait until you see\nthe back side of that one.\n\n2089\n01:48:40,667 --> 01:48:44,090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, wait until you see that.\n\n2090\n01:48:44,090 --> 01:48:45,808\nSo.\n>> [CROSSTALK] [INAUDIBLE]\n\n2091\n01:48:45,808 --> 01:48:46,578\n>> A lot of stuff.\n\n2092\n01:48:46,578 --> 01:48:48,150\n>>

another episode of ITproTV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,950\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriano.\n\n5\n00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,190\nHow you doing today, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,310\n>> Doing sweet.\n\n7\n00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,970\n>> Fantastic, fantastic.\n\n8\n00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,150\nWe've got another great episode\nlined up for you guys today.\n\n9\n00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,790\nWe're continuing on with our wireless.\n\n10\n00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:53,285\nSo we're doing a wireless part deux or\npart two.\n\n11\n00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:57,255\nAnd we're gonna talk about some more\nattacks that we can do with wireless, and\n\n12\n00:00:57,255 --> 00:00:59,295\nthen we're gonna move on into bluetooth,\n\n13\n00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:02,005\nkind of a sub category\nof our wireless care.\n\n14\n00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:03,485\nLots we can do with bluetooth as well.\n\n15\n00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:08,754\nSo, sit back and enjoy, and let's get\nstarted with some wireless attacks.\n\n16\n00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:10,665\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, we got a few.\n\n17\n00:01:10,665 --> 00:01:12,285\nI know we left off kind of with part one.\n\n18\n00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,795\nWe were going through\nattacks against wireless.\n\n19\n00:01:14,795 --> 00:01:18,240\nWe've talked about some of them that\nattack confidentiality, integrity,\n\n20\n00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,030\navailability.\n\n21\n00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,590\nAnd some terms, probably,\n\n22\n00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,040\nand types of attacks we need to be\nfamiliar with, especially for this exam.\n\n23\n00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,840\nWhat do we want to start with?\n\n24\n00:01:26,955 --> 00:01:30,540\n>> Well, there's a handful of,\nones we still wanna talk and\n\n25\n00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,280\nmake sure you're aware of.\n\n26\n00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,920\nYeah we did cover quite a bit\nof ground yesterday, but\n\n27\n00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,470\nsome additional ones we wanna talk about,\n\n28\n00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:40,940\nare class of attack called,\nthat I like to call the war attacks.\n\n29\n00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,650\nThat you may have heard\nthe terminology before.\n\n30\n00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,360\nWe have things like war driving,\nwar flying and, and\n\n31\n00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,920\nwar walking are-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n32\n00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,040\n>> just three of the main categories.\n\n33\n00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,070\n>> I love these terms.\n\n34\n00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,190\n>> Yeah, they're just,\npeople just like doing that, right?\n\n35\n00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,630\nIt's just like throwing and\nmaking these things up.\n\n36\n00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,552\nIt's sounds cool, right?\n\n37\n00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:58,467\n>> [LAUGH] It does.\nIt sounds great.\n\n38\n00:01:58,467 --> 00:01:59,560\nI want to do it.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n39\n00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,720\n>> As long as you wear a helmet or\n\n40\n00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,380\nsomething like that.\n\n41\n00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,595\n>> Jason over there mentioned,\n\n42\n00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:06,961\nI do war driving every morning at this\ndarned intersection right outside of work.\n\n43\n00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,190\nAaaahh!\n\n44\n00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,190\n>> He's out there with truckasaurus,\njust, brrrrrr.\n\n45\n00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,668\n>> He's got the 50 cal mounted on top.\n\n46\n00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:17,420\n[LAUGH]\n>> [INAUDIBLE] Valhalla.\n\n47\n00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,106\n>> But not what we mean when we're\ntalking about war driving in\n\n48\n00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,430\nwireless modules, right?\n\n49\n00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,340\n>> Exactly.\n\n50\n00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,370\nSo, but yeah, so\nwe have these war attacks.\n\n51\n00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,690\nThey're really quite simple,\n\n52\n00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:34,070\neven though its name implies that\nthere's some big thing going on.\n\n53\n00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:39,400\nWar driving is really is kind of like\ndoing a site survey on a larger scale.\n\n54\n00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,500\n>> Right.\n\n55\n00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,720\nExcept what we're doing\nis we have a notebook or\n\n56\n00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,860\nsome wireless enabled device with software\nin it that when we drive around and\n\n57\n00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,910\nwe'd leave our WiFi on and we used to\nstart pinging and locating access points.\n\n58\n00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,860\nSo, when we go through and\n\n59\n00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,240\nwe do something like that it allows us to,\nwe can locate that one.\n\n60\n00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,470\nWhat makes it really\neffective is that we can\n\n61\n00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,515\nplug a GPS into it or nowadays\nthere's GPSs on almost everything now.\n\n62\n00:03:08,515 --> 00:03:09,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n63\n00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,864\nSo we can start picking up where\nthese things are, and if you do with\n\n64\n00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:20,790\nenough patience, and if you're war driving\nat the right speed, there actually is,\n\n65\n00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,285\nif the faster you go the less likely you\nare to get an accurate reading on it.\n\n66\n00:03:24,285 --> 00:03:26,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because you have to get a few beacons\n\n67\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,210\nout of it to really kind of locate it and\nnarrow it down.\n\n68\n00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,480\nBut once you, if you have a GPS, and\n\n69\n00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,290\nyou're driving at a good speed,\nyou will actually start to be able to\n\n70\n00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,205\nlocate these access points within a few\nfeet or maybe even closer in some cases.\n\n71\n00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:39,950\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n72\n00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,170\nAnd really you just need\nto get in range of them.\n\n73\n00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,994\nIn the end but there's a lot, like you\nsaid, there's lots of software that can\n\n74\n00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:51,962\nplug into my computer and it'll pull up a\nmap and it will, as you're driving by and\n\n75\n00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:56,390\nyour laptop or whatever device it\nis picks up these access points.\n\n76\n00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,480\nIt'll mark it on the map for\nyou, and then we can go back and\n\n77\n00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,545\ntry to figure out if they're secured or\nnot secured and things like that.\n\n78\n00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:07,280\n>> Yeah, that's really it, yeah, and\nthese in fact a lot of these software will\n\n79\n00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,590\nactually tell you security protocols and\nother things that are configured there.\n\n80\n00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:17,660\nSo, yeah, it's just a matter of\nwhat it's using, now you just gotta\n\n81\n00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,830\nsee which ones are worth attacking and\ndrive home the attack on it.\n\n82\n00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,530\nSo, that's really it.\n\n83\n00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,470\nBut it is quite effective.\n\n84\n00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,762\nThen you look at war walking,\nsame type of thing except,\n\n85\n00:04:29,762 --> 00:04:30,800\nyour means-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n86\n00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160\n>> Of local motion changed.\n\n87\n00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,270\nYou spent too much of your money on\nhacking equipment, you gotta call,\n\n88\n00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,560\nyou can't afford a car-\n>> [LAUGH] There goes Shawn, walking down\n\n89\n00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,030\nthe side walk, he's got his backpack-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n90\n00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,639\n>> Antennae's sticking out in every\n\n91\n00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,253\ndirection.\n\n92\n00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:44,586\n>> You see me doing the whole thing,\ntrying to look gangster doing it.\n\n93\n00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:47,340\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You\n\n94\n00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,740\ndon't really need a whole lot\nof equipment to do this, right?\n\n95\n00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,260\nYour laptop, heck, you can do it on your\nphone, your phone will pick up wireless\n\n96\n00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,240\nnetworks and so the right software loaded\nup on there, it's not like you have to\n\n97\n00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,630\nlook like some kind of electronic\ncriminal, or something like that.\n\n98\n00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,860\nBut the one that puzzles me though,\n\n99\n00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,260\nis I understand we're walking, and\nI lived in DC for a few years,\n\n100\n00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,175\nand you would see, cuz they would also do\nthe war chalking I guess they call it.\n\n101\n00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,020\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Where they would mark buildings.\n\n102\n00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,820\nIf you got these people were not\nreally looking to attack things.\n\n103\n00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,680\nThey were looking for free WiFi.\n\n104\n00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,770\nAnd so they would do their war walking or\nwar driving, and when they found it,\n\n105\n00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,500\nyou've got these big, large,\nmany story apartment buildings, and\n\n106\n00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,370\nwhen they would find one that was open,\nthey would mark it on the side of the wall\n\n107\n00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,230\nwith a certain chalk mark so\nthat other people could say, oh,\n\n108\n00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:34,010\nthere's an open access point near here so\nI can kinda sit here and get access.\n\n109\n00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,128\nThe war flying though,\nthat's the one that puzzles me.\n\n110\n00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:41,711\nBecause I'm thinking what, in a Cessna,\none of the slower planes you can get,\n\n111\n00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:43,900\nyou're doing, what, about 20 I'd think.\n\n112\n00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,940\nI mean, they might be able to get\ndown to 80 full flaps and everything.\n\n113\n00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,460\nYou're the pilot, you tell me.\n\n114\n00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:51,340\n>> Well, you can slow fly it,\nfor sure, and get it so\n\n115\n00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,510\nthere are ways to slow flight to get it so\nit's really, really, really slow.\n\n116\n00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,393\nBut-\n>> But, I mean in that the access point,\n\n117\n00:05:57,393 --> 00:05:59,175\nyou'll be going, oh wait there's a, oh,\n\n118\n00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:00,040\nwait there's a-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n119\n00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,310\n>> And, oh God, and\n\n120\n00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,740\nhow low do I need to be to start\npicking up these access points if I'm\n\n121\n00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,015\nflying in an airplane?\n\n122\n00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:08,390\nYeah, you can do it.\n\n123\n00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,920\nI mean there is,\nthere is such thing slow fight in\n\n124\n00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,450\nan aircraft where you can keep\nthe thing moving very slow.\n\n125\n00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,330\nWhere a reasonably moving car\nwould be able to pass me, but.\n\n126\n00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,720\nIf I want to do it.\n\n127\n00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,290\nWe do that in search and rescue, in fact.\n\n128\n00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:26,465\nWe see something we can't do,\nlike you said, so there's way to do it.\n\n129\n00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:30,750\nBut, people start using that as\na way to locate access points.\n\n130\n00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,510\nJust get a good antenna and\nyou could sweep and area pretty quickly.\n\n131\n00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,460\n>> I guess that's the key, is having\na nice antenna that can pick that up from\n\n132\n00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,300\na little further than your normal range.\n\n133\n00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,700\n>> Yeah, and\nthen you can just circle the area.\n\n134\n00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,685\nThat's something that they actually\nteach us how to do when we're flying so\n\n135\n00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:47,452\nyou could do that.\n\n136\n00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:51,800\nBut, I noticed here in\nthe discussion groups here,\n\n137\n00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,180\nthat people are mentioning drones.\n\n138\n00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,390\nYeah, that's pretty much moved to drones.\n\n139\n00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,280\nThat's drone territory now.\n\n140\n00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,209\nYou can still do it from a light aircraft,\nbut it's more likely that you're\n\n141\n00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:09,062\ngoing to be doing it with the drone\nnowadays, it's just more economical,\n\n142\n00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:14,628\nit's less conspicuous, so the technology's\nthere, so that's the way they do it.\n\n143\n00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:15,920\n>> Makes a lot more sense.\n\n144\n00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,503\n>> Yeah.\n\n145\n00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,880\nAnd they even have variations of that too,\nthey have stuff like war ballooning.\n\n146\n00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,470\n>> I was gonna say,\nballoons might be nice.\n\n147\n00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,003\nYou're a relatively slow pace.\n\n148\n00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:28,625\nJust don't have a lot of control\nof which direction you're going.\n\n149\n00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:30,585\n>> Yeah, pretty much you don't but\n\n150\n00:07:30,585 --> 00:07:36,640\nthen you think about it,\nif the winds were right and\n\n151\n00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:42,366\nyou want to get a survey of an area\nthat was maybe fenced in or something.\n\n152\n00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:45,688\nYou could, it's a drone, flying a drone\nover something like a work yard or\n\n153\n00:07:45,688 --> 00:07:46,705\nsomething like that.\n\n154\n00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:51,529\nThat's gonna look kind of conspicuous if\nit's sitting out there just hovering, but\n\n155\n00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:56,219\nyou go down to some store where they sell,\nkids' balloons or something like that,\n\n156\n00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,641\nand tie your device onto that and\nlet it go.\n\n157\n00:07:58,641 --> 00:08:02,545\nSoon as they go, some kid Lost,\nso, you know lost you know,\n\n158\n00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,157\nlost their balloons, and.\n\n159\n00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:06,484\n>> People aren't going to think\ntwice about that flying overhead.\n\n160\n00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:08,269\n>> Yeah.\n>> Oh, it's just some kid's balloon from\n\n161\n00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:09,910\nthe park or something, yeah.\n\n162\n00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,476\n>> Yeah, we're conditioned\nto see that sort of thing.\n\n163\n00:08:12,476 --> 00:08:15,930\nSo it's a little it's a, it's a lot\nless you know, obvious at that point.\n\n164\n00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,265\n>> And, and really the whole goal of all\nof these methods is to find access points.\n\n165\n00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:22,590\n>> You're either looking for open access\npoints so I can get connectivity.\n\n166\n00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,599\nOr, as you say, trying to determine if\nsome facility has any access points out\n\n167\n00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:29,783\nthere that I, that I might not\nbe able to get close to walking.\n\n168\n00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:33,430\nMaybe, I could send a balloon over,\nor a drone over, something like that.\n\n169\n00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,460\nBut in the end, they're all just\ntrying to find access points.\n\n170\n00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,679\n>> Yeah, absolutely, that's, that', that's\nall, that's all they're intended to do,\n\n171\n00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,105\nis just map, is just map this stuff out.\n\n172\n00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,660\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Ex, except the warchalking.\n\n173\n00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,465\nWarchalking is actually to\ntell you where they are.\n\n174\n00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:46,278\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Once you map it out,\n\n175\n00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:47,979\nthen you mark it to let\nsomeone else can come in.\n\n176\n00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:49,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Later on and do that.\n\n177\n00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,630\nIn fact,\nyou know where warchalking came from?\n\n178\n00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,310\n>> Yeah.\n\n179\n00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,450\n>> There's actually something someone\npointed out to me called hobo marks.\n\n180\n00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,080\n>> Oh, yeah.\n\n181\n00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,170\n>> If you look it up, yeah.\n>> I've heard that.\n\n182\n00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,915\nWhere there are houses that are, or\nthe areas that are safe to sleep, and\n\n183\n00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,730\nnobody bothers you.\n\n184\n00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,170\nOr houses that might give food,\nand things like that.\n\n185\n00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,120\nHuh, that's interesting.\n\n186\n00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,645\nSo yeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:07,732\n>> We do, we took it from that and\n\n188\n00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:09,390\nkinda moved it over to\nthe electronic world.\n\n189\n00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,849\n>> Yeah, right, I, someone put,\n\n190\n00:09:10,849 --> 00:09:13,374\nturned me on to that.\nI was like, oh, well oh, yeah, and\n\n191\n00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:15,957\nI had no idea, but they had like\njust repurposed it from that.\n\n192\n00:09:15,957 --> 00:09:17,235\n>> Right.\n>> And did their own thing.\n\n193\n00:09:17,235 --> 00:09:20,008\nIt's kind of, it's kind of,\nyou know, fascinating to, to, the,\n\n194\n00:09:20,008 --> 00:09:22,364\nthe stuff that they just did,\nthat they do with that, too.\n\n195\n00:09:22,364 --> 00:09:24,639\nYou see those, you see those marks,\nnot the whole remarks.\n\n196\n00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,070\nBut are called, you know,\nthat's something entirely different.\n\n197\n00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,015\nBut when you see you know, the,\nthose warchalking symbols.\n\n198\n00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:33,063\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You see them all, you know,\n\n199\n00:09:33,063 --> 00:09:34,041\nover the place.\n\n200\n00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:38,016\nAnd interestingly enough, you go to some\nplaces, and I mean, I've seen you know,\n\n201\n00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:41,938\nthat they've, there's some signs in,\nin places in, in in Europe and other, and\n\n202\n00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:42,796\nother areas.\n\n203\n00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:45,270\nThey're not widespread and\nthey're not standardized.\n\n204\n00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,366\nBut you do see some of those\nlittle tin signs hung up that had,\n\n205\n00:09:48,366 --> 00:09:52,905\nactually repurpose the warchalking symbols\nto say, yeah, we've got a hot spot here.\n\n206\n00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:54,360\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Instead of just saying hey,\n\n207\n00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,350\nwe've got a hot spot.\n\n208\n00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,406\nThat's become kinda like\nthe international symbol, you know?\n\n209\n00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:58,800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like the men's and\n\n210\n00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,300\nwomen's bathrooms there, that have the,\nthe name and then the symbol next to it.\n\n211\n00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,358\n>> Right.\n>> It's the same thing.\n\n212\n00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:06,150\nThey're reusing the, they're,\nthey're reusing In the symbols for that so\n\n213\n00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,410\npeople know there's wireless there.\n\n214\n00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,930\nSo they have the, you know, the back to\nback Cs and stuff like that saying, yeah,\n\n215\n00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,110\nwe've got an access point here for you.\n\n216\n00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,745\nYeah, there you go.\n\n217\n00:10:13,745 --> 00:10:17,380\n>> Yeah,\nthere's a an image of some warchalking.\n\n218\n00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,449\nAnd you can see some people,\nthat they try to, you know, I don't know.\n\n219\n00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,035\nThey, they try to make a standard to it,\nor something like that.\n\n220\n00:10:23,035 --> 00:10:26,216\nBut it's very, as you said,\nlocalized usually spread,\n\n221\n00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:27,895\nyou know in the areas that.\n\n222\n00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,120\n>> Well when you get,\nwhen you get stuff like this.\n\n223\n00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,375\n>> [COUGH]\n>> This is at this level,\n\n224\n00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,255\nthe symbols you found.\n\n225\n00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:36,951\nThese are these are these are, at this\nlevel, they're pretty much standardized.\n\n226\n00:10:36,951 --> 00:10:38,205\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But yeah, there's other ones that\n\n227\n00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:41,560\nare kind of like, you know, people\nhave made up their own ones, you know?\n\n228\n00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,850\nThese ones people have pretty\nmuch you know agreed on.\n\n229\n00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,420\n>> Right.\n\n230\n00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,165\n>> But, yeah, the, the back-to-back seed,\nthe unrestricted access.\n\n231\n00:10:48,165 --> 00:10:48,690\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n232\n00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,180\n>> The MAC filtering, stuff like that.\n\n233\n00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,960\nThose ones are, are, are, are,\nthose ones are pretty standard.\n\n234\n00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,980\n>> Right.\n>> But the other, the other ones,\n\n235\n00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,010\nyou know, like the pay-for access point,\nI haven't see that a lot.\n\n236\n00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,090\nNor the X, haven't seen that.\n\n237\n00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,074\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah so but\n\n238\n00:11:02,074 --> 00:11:03,403\nit doesn't mean they're not used.\n\n239\n00:11:03,403 --> 00:11:05,380\nJust not, they're just not popular.\n\n240\n00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,432\nThose might be cus, and those might be,\nyou know, custom to specific geo or\n\n241\n00:11:08,432 --> 00:11:09,350\nsomething like that.\n\n242\n00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,100\n>> Right.\n\n243\n00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,630\n>> But yeah, they're,\nthey're, they're out there.\n\n244\n00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,950\nAnd the thing is is that,\n\n245\n00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,910\nyou really, you know, kind of got\nto keep your eyes open to see them.\n\n246\n00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,715\n>> Yeah.\n>> You'll see these symbols around there,\n\n247\n00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:21,839\nbut you know, it doesn't mean they're\nalways gonna be on a curb or something.\n\n248\n00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,122\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They could be on the side of\n\n249\n00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:23,834\na building.\n\n250\n00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,280\nThey could be, you know,\nscribbled on the side of an awning.\n\n251\n00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,180\n>> Right, cuz they don't want to make\nthem too obvious where somebody's gonna\n\n252\n00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,120\nclean them up.\n\n253\n00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,464\n>> Yeah.\n>> And they come in and wipe it out,\n\n254\n00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:32,050\nall that work.\n\n255\n00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,250\nSo, try to kind of disguise them\nin a way but make them findable,\n\n256\n00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,600\nif you know what to look for.\n\n257\n00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,190\n>> Yeah.\n\n258\n00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,894\nActually yeah, that's,\nthat's, that's exactly right.\n\n259\n00:11:40,894 --> 00:11:42,230\n>> Oops, sorry, yeah, all right.\n\n260\n00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,610\n>> All right, so we've got a, a few\ndifferent terminology that we mentioned,\n\n261\n00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,450\nwarp drive, warchalking, warflying,\nwarwalking, warballooning, warrocketing.\n\n262\n00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,280\nI think somebody out actually\nput warsubmarining, you know?\n\n263\n00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,760\nSo lots of different ways we can change\nour mode of transportation as you said.\n\n264\n00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,740\nBut in the end, we're really just looking\nfor those wireless access points using\n\n265\n00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,910\nsome kinda software that can allow\nus to detect those access points.\n\n266\n00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,715\nRemember that most of them are beckoning\nunless they've disabled the,\n\n267\n00:12:08,715 --> 00:12:11,790\nthe broadcast of the SSID,\nthose access points just sit there and\n\n268\n00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,819\nbeacon I think by default every\nlike 100 milliseconds or something.\n\n269\n00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,308\n>> Yeah.\n>> So 10 times a second\n\n270\n00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:20,730\nthey're sending out these beacon packets\nand we're just picking those up.\n\n271\n00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,480\nAnd in that beacon packet is the,\nthe SSID, you know, what they're using for\n\n272\n00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,930\nsecurity, if any and things like that.\n\n273\n00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:31,530\nAnd with the right software, we can start\nplotting that out, saving it on maps, and\n\n274\n00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,320\nthings like that.\n\n275\n00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,290\nAnd so it's just a, a way to,\nto basically, as you said,\n\n276\n00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,650\ndo a wireless survey\nover a much larger area.\n\n277\n00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,400\nNot my own company, but\nmaybe a, a geographic area, so.\n\n278\n00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,559\n>> You know, it's, if you, if you, if you\nlook through some of the news articles and\n\n279\n00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,756\nstuff like that, recently, and\n\n280\n00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:49,035\nsome of the experimental stuff\npeople are doing in security.\n\n281\n00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:49,832\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n282\n00:12:49,832 --> 00:12:53,595\n>> Some somebody actually came up\nwith something called the warcat.\n\n283\n00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:54,720\n>> [LAUGH].\nThe warcat?\n\n284\n00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,706\n>> Yeah, or warkitty, as you called it.\n\n285\n00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,839\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you put a,\n\n286\n00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,588\nhe took his grandmother's cat and\nthe collar.\n\n287\n00:13:00,588 --> 00:13:04,935\nHe stuck a little receiver on a GPS thing\nand let the thing go about it's day.\n\n288\n00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:06,686\n>> Really? [LAUGH] >> And\nhe said, he, he, he said,\n\n289\n00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,931\njust to see just to see how many access\npoints he could pick up that way.\n\n290\n00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:10,536\n>> [LAUGH].\nRight?\n\n291\n00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:13,500\n>> And he said he picked up, interestingly\nenough, he picked up way more.\n\n292\n00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,762\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Than he, with that cat,\n\n293\n00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:17,430\nif he went to the, if he, than he\nwould have went to in the same areas,\n\n294\n00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,640\ndoing any of the other methods\nthat we talked about here.\n\n295\n00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,355\n>> Right, cuz he's cruising right up next\nto the houses, and through yards, and\n\n296\n00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:24,420\nstuff like that, so.\n\n297\n00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:24,921\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n298\n00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:25,421\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n299\n00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,243\n>> You could find a picture\n\n300\n00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,626\nonline of this cat with his little collar.\nIt's got this little lump on\n\n301\n00:13:28,626 --> 00:13:29,620\nthe side of it.\n>> Right.\n\n302\n00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,462\n>> And the guy just cruised around for the\nday and, you know, and, and he came back,\n\n303\n00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:35,050\nand he pulled the data.\n\n304\n00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,020\n>> Oh, the next thing we're going to have\nto do then is get a carrier pigeon, and\n\n305\n00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,993\nstrap one to that thing.\n\n306\n00:13:38,993 --> 00:13:39,524\n>> Yeah, there you go.\n\n307\n00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:41,478\n[LAUGH]\n>> And send it across country, and\n\n308\n00:13:41,478 --> 00:13:43,767\njust map out the whole US, or something.\n\n309\n00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,090\n[LAUGH].\nThat's classic.\n\n310\n00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,416\nI like it, I like it.\n\n311\n00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:50,146\nLet's see, someone asked me William was\nasking someone asked yesterday if there\n\n312\n00:13:50,146 --> 00:13:52,663\nwas a known way to break out of\nthe guest network on a wireless,\n\n313\n00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:55,658\nwhere there was access point,\naccess point dash guest.\n\n314\n00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:57,088\nI, I, I don't know, Sean.\n\n315\n00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:00,299\nI think it really is gonna depend\non the hardware, you know?\n\n316\n00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,700\nThe Cox versus Comcast versus your ISP,\nwhether they make that available or not.\n\n317\n00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,509\nOh wait, I'm sorry.\n\n318\n00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,100\nI misread that question.\n\n319\n00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,810\nTo break out of it,\nwell that goes back to what your,\n\n320\n00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,490\nyour router hacking techniques right?\n\n321\n00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,610\nTrying to jump a VLAN, or.\n\n322\n00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,920\n>> Yeah, and, and you know, it, it's,\nthat's that, with that question,\n\n323\n00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,660\nyou know, all I could sit here and\n\n324\n00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,320\nsay with it is that there, yeah,\nthere could be ways to do it.\n\n325\n00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,960\nI don't know if the network\narchitecture is just by looking,\n\n326\n00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,590\njust by having a couple\naccess point names.\n\n327\n00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,300\nThose just, those could be two\nentirely separate networks.\n\n328\n00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,440\n>> Right.\n>> You know, it's, it, it, if they're,\n\n329\n00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,018\nif they're two entirely separate networks\nand just named the same, then, then, no.\n\n330\n00:14:38,018 --> 00:14:39,210\nOr like, those, those,\n\n331\n00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,230\nyou know, those modems slash access point\ncombinations that these ISPs are giving?\n\n332\n00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,230\nAnd they generate this free hotspot,\nplus you have your own personal network.\n\n333\n00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,030\nBut it's all the same machine.\n\n334\n00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:53,250\nSo they're, they're probably doing,\nI don't know how, and it would depends\n\n335\n00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,100\non how are they segregating those two\nnetworks on that one access point.\n\n336\n00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,310\nAre they doing VLANS or is there\nseparate physical hardware inside there?\n\n337\n00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,190\nI don't know what they're doing.\n\n338\n00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,788\n>> Yeah,\nthat would be the word I'd be looking for.\n\n339\n00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:05,150\nYeah, is those, I'm looking for,\nyou know, how they're segregated,\n\n340\n00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,185\nseparated those out.\n\n341\n00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:07,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If they you know,\n\n342\n00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,270\nif they haven't, if, depending on\nhow they've set that up, you know?\n\n343\n00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,525\nThat's gonna dictate whether or not\nyou're able to jump, to jump over or not.\n\n344\n00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:14,431\n>> Hm-hm.\n\n345\n00:15:14,431 -->

it's.\n\n413\n00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,180\n>> Yeah, so you get the, the, you know,\nthe idea that you could make something, or\n\n414\n00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,910\ncreate something that really all you can\ndo is generate signal in that frequency.\n\n415\n00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,400\nIf, if it's running 2.4 or 5 gigahertz,\n\n416\n00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,390\nif I can create

to use a lot\ncould have been 2.4 Gigahertz as well.\n\n423\n00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,070\nSo there's some examples of, of,\nyou know, things that would occur.\n\n424\n00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,290\nNot naturally, but normally.\n\n425\n00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,750\nAnd heck, you can go down to\nan electronics store, and\n\n426\n00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,720\npick up everything you need to generate\na signal in a particular frequency range.\n\n427\n00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,270\n>> Yeah.\nAnd you can, you can buy the pre-,\n\n428\n00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,190\nbuy premade

not\nwanna mess with those.\n\n432\n00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,472\nThose things come, those things typically\ncome from China, or something like that.\n\n433\n00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,282\n>>

Mm-hm.\n\n459\n00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,750\n>> Cuz the, they, they were, they were\nworking at JFK which is New York airport.\n\n460\n00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,500\nThe, the, they were, were, had been still\nworking on the air traffic control system\n\n461\n00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,010\nthere, doing some upgrades to it.\n\n462\n00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,130\nAnd they started seeing disruptions\na couple of times a day.\n\n463\n00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,020\nAnd, what happened is, is that they found\nout that there were two times, the tw,\n\n464\n00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,150\nthe the times a day when traffic happened\nto be going by, because there was a,\n\n465\n00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,710\nthere was a major road near\none side of the airport.\n\n466\n00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,640\nAnd so.\n\n467\n00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,840\nThey, they found that's what it was.\n\n468\n00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,550\nAnd they, or found it what time it was.\n\n469\n00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,110\nSo they said,\nsomeone's got a jammer in their car.\n\n470\n00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,320\nAnd so the FCC and the, the sheriffs and\nall that, went out there.\n\n471\n00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,940\nAnd, they started sweeping\nall the cars as they went by.\n\n472\n00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,500\nAnd they narrowed it down to a work truck.\n\n473\n00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,600\nAnd in that work truck,\nthey found the guy had a GPS jammer in it.\n\n474\n00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,540\nAnd, yeah,\nit didn't turn out well for that guy.\n\n475\n00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,860\n>> Wow.\n>> He's one of the one's that got a 35,000\n\n476\n00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:46,800\ndollar fine, and on top of it because he,\nthe reason he had a GPS jammer was,\n\n477\n00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:51,040\nhe was trying, his, his boss had\ninstalled GPS trappers in all his things\n\n478\n00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,020\nto make sure no one was doing any,\nshenanigans, you know, and all that so.\n\n479\n00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,200\nThis guy was trying to jam it so\nhe couldn't get tracked, and, so\n\n480\n00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,350\nhis boss fired him, too.\n\n481\n00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,460\nSo, yeah, he's got a fine and\nno way to pay for it right now.\n\n482\n00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,820\n>> Wow.\n>> He did it, so, they'll, they'll catch,\n\n483\n00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,770\nif something like that goes by an airport,\nyeah, they're going to,\n\n484\n00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,430\nyou're going to do that same thing,\nyou enter, you know,a, a, a military base,\n\n485\n00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,560\nanywhere in the world do it near it\n>> You could get someone knocking on your\n\n486\n00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,080\ndoor pretty quickly, saying you know,\n\n487\n00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,530\n\"what's going on?\"\n>> Yeah, and, and I know we\n\n488\n00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,500\ngot a comment out there about, customers\nhad truckers buy those all the time.\n\n489\n00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,250\nAnd yeah, we used to work for\na trucking company and I remember when we,\n\n490\n00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,280\nwhen we first installed satellites on,\non all of our trucks,\n\n491\n00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,030\nthey would do whatever, they would come\nup with all kinds of ingenious ways.\n\n492\n00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,080\nThey would park their rig under, a\nconcrete bridge, they'd wrap that thing up\n\n493\n00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,040\nin tin foil, they'd do whatever they could\nto keep us from being to track them and\n\n494\n00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,980\nit doesn't surprise me they're\ntrying to use those jammers.\n\n495\n00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,340\nBut as, as you just saw, you know, it was\na great example of that cuz this guy is\n\n496\n00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,570\nreally not trying to cause any\nharm outside of, you know,\n\n497\n00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,230\nto, to the airport or to anything like\nthat, but he ended up doing that.\n\n498\n00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,680\nAnd, and\nthat's why they have to really be,\n\n499\n00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,050\nbe tight on these things is because\npeople don't realize what else they're,\n\n500\n00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,030\nthey don't think about what\nelse they could be affecting.\n\n501\n00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,420\nBy just trying to block\nthat signal in his van,\n\n502\n00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,290\nhe ended up disrupting an air\ntraffic control tower.\n\n503\n00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,080\nSo there's, they're not gonna\nplay with things like that.\n\n504\n00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,820\nSo you guys be safe.\n\n505\n00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,850\nDon't play around with those.\n\n506\n00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,090\nAllright, so\nwe've got different types of attacks.\n\n507\n00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,665\nNext on our List, I think is Bluetooth and\na lot of terminology there,\n\n508\n00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:20,975\na lot of different things we can do.\n\n509\n00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:26,035\nWith our good old 2.4 short\nrange RF communication.\n\n510\n00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:28,695\n>> Yeah, Bluetooth is,\nis an interesting one.\n\n511\n00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:31,100\nIt's that 802.15 standard.\n\n512\n00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,730\nIt is, short range, wireless.\n\n513\n00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,645\nIt actually has the capability and\nthe spec to go longer-\n\n514\n00:22:36,645 --> 00:22:37,440\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n515\n00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,710\n>> But it's, it's, you're til,\n\n516\n00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:43,370\ntypically talking at most about 30 feet,\non, on average.\n\n517\n00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,190\nSo, you might get that.\n\n518\n00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,020\nDon't count on it.\n\n519\n00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,330\nYou know, you've heard the speech\nbefore about environmental factors and\n\n520\n00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,810\nall that actually limiting-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n521\n00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,810\n>> Speed and distance.\n\n522\n00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,360\nBluetooth is no different.\n\n523\n00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,620\nSo, blue, you know,\nbluetooth is short range,\n\n524\n00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,500\nit's actually falls in the category of\nwhat they call personal area networking\n\n525\n00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,249\ntechnology, you know, so you can use it\nto, you know, to link together you know,\n\n526\n00:23:06,249 --> 00:23:10,030\ndifferent devices and services so they can\ntalk [INAUDIBLE], talk to one another.\n\n527\n00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,200\nYou know, that was the, that was\nthe whole idea when they came up with it.\n\n528\n00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,240\nIn fact-\n>> Like your headset,\n\n529\n00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,750\nyour phone, or, or something like that.\n\n530\n00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,330\nYeah.\n>> Yeah.\n\n531\n00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,380\nAnd, you know, they come up,\nwhen they originally came up,\n\n532\n00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,070\nwith the idea they envision this.\n\n533\n00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,880\nIt was around the time the original\nPalm Pilot's and Newton's all came out,\n\n534\n00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,140\nit was that far back.\n\n535\n00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,350\nIt had its genesis because\npeople at the time, especially,\n\n536\n00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:33,450\nyou know, the computer, the computer\ngeeks and the engineers and all of that,\n\n537\n00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,610\nyou know, were, hey, wouldn't it be\ngreat if you could walk into a room and\n\n538\n00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:40,020\nfind all the devices you could talk to and\njust start, and, and, start being able to\n\n539\n00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,600\ncommunicate with them, without having\nto you know, wire yourself in.\n\n540\n00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,479\nSo it has genesis back there,\nyou know, nowadays, you know, we,\n\n541\n00:23:48,479 --> 00:23:51,080\nwe're used to bluetooth being everywhere.\n\n542\n00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,139\nYou know you, you, you,\nyou, you mention it,\n\n543\n00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:58,330\nyou mentioned a place we have well\nbluetooth is, is, is, has been there.\n\n544\n00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:58,933\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n545\n00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:03,266\n>> You know, so it's and so people like\nthe fact that they can just You know,\n\n546\n00:24:03,266 --> 00:24:06,606\nsuch as sub-wirelessly back and\nforth, have the plugs to fit, and\n\n547\n00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:08,615\nhave all this wire, same type of thing.\n\n548\n00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,057\n>> Yeah, and I, I know they divide up\nthose radios in the different classes, and\n\n549\n00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,750\nI just trying to memorize, you know.\n\n550\n00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,350\nI, I was gonna do a quick search so\nI don't get that wrong.\n\n551\n00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,710\nI got, the class one, I think,\nwas the short one right?\n\n552\n00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,940\nIf I remember, it was like a few feet.\n\n553\n00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,620\nClass 2, was like a 30 foot, and\nI can't remember what Class 3 was.\n\n554\n00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,690\nI was gonna try to look\nthat up real quick.\n\n555\n00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,570\nLittle longer range and so,\ndepending on what you're trying to do,\n\n556\n00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:33,468\nlike a keyboard and mouse might\nhave one of those Class 1 radios.\n\n557\n00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:37,740\nI remember had a bluetooth keyboard I\nmean you had to be within eight feet of\n\n558\n00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,810\nthe darn TV to use it.\n\n559\n00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,340\nPretty useless.\n\n560\n00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,430\nBut then you moved up to a class two, you\ncould get a little further away from it.\n\n561\n00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:45,230\nAnd right as you said you can always\nplay with some of those radios to change\n\n562\n00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,060\nthe the power on them as well.\n\n563\n00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,176\n>> Yeah there's always a little\nthere's always a little tricks.\n\n564\n00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:52,316\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can, you can do.\n\n565\n00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:54,440\nTo kind of coax a little more out of it.\n\n566\n00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,648\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> Some of them,\n\n567\n00:24:55,648 --> 00:24:58,073\nsome of them I'll be talking about here.\n\n568\n00:24:58,073 --> 00:25:00,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah did I say that?\n\n569\n00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,850\nSo, but yeah you have, you have different\nyou have different techniques of coaxing\n\n570\n00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:12,110\nmore out of it, but yeah, Bluetooth is\n2.4 gigahertz, it's short range, it's,\n\n571\n00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,750\nit's not very high bandwidth compared\nto some of the other technologies.\n\n572\n00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,860\nBut it is, it's getting there.\n\n573\n00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,640\nIt's definitely,\nit's definitely getting there.\n\n574\n00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,550\nMm, it's mm, it's mm, it pushes much\nmore data nowadays than it did.\n\n575\n00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,790\nYou know several years ago.\n\n576\n00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,991\nYou know so like I said we're seeing it\non you know, and on just about you know,\n\n577\n00:25:30,991 --> 00:25:35,640\nevery on just about everything and\nthe compatibility problems are gone.\n\n578\n00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,210\nThat was that plagued\nthe early bluetooth devices.\n\n579\n00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,970\nYou know so it's, it's really kind of\ncut cut its teeth and been through it.\n\n580\n00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,350\nOne of the things that has been\nless than stellar on it is, is,\n\n581\n00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,150\nis the security on those,\non, on Bluetooth.\n\n582\n00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,570\nThey didn't really think about that.\n\n583\n00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,430\nAnd, you know, we've been through that\ndiscussion before with other technologies,\n\n584\n00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,570\nis that they created it, and\nthey were just like hey,\n\n585\n00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,650\nwouldn't it be great to be able\nto have these things talk?\n\n586\n00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,330\nNo one was like yeah what about security?\n\n587\n00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:04,470\nYou know, or that person was way\nin the back and no one heard him.\n\n588\n00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:07,828\nYou know, so, that's,\nthat's was that when they,\n\n589\n00:26:07,828 --> 00:26:11,350\nthat's a problem that has\nplagued this technology too.\n\n590\n00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,200\nAnd it wasn't too long after it came,\n\n591\n00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,450\nafter it really started hitting its\nstride, that Bluetooth hit its stride.\n\n592\n00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,360\nIt was on enough devices.\n\n593\n00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,470\nAnd, and that's the, and\nthat's the key thing with any technology.\n\n594\n00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:27,080\nIf someone says, you know, hey, well this\nstuff has never been hacked or broken.\n\n595\n00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,400\nOne of the things you always want to\nkinda want to consider is, you know,\n\n596\n00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,480\nhow many of those devices are,\nare out there.\n\n597\n00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,790\nYou know they probably\nhave been hacked but\n\n598\n00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,052\nit's not really visible\nbecause there's not enough.\n\n599\n00:26:37,052 --> 00:26:40,050\nI, I used to, you know,\nit still does tick me off when people say,\n\n600\n00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,880\noh my apple computer's never been hacked.\n\n601\n00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,865\nYea it has.\n\n602\n00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:45,056\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes, yes, it has, okay.\n\n603\n00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:47,560\n>> [LAUGH] Just deal with it.\n\n604\n00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,743\nYou know, so, where they got that\nfrom is that you know for, for\n\n605\n00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:54,540\nthe Apple case, you know, you look at it.\n\n606\n00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,640\nThe first mainstream viruses that were\ncreated, were created for Apple computers.\n\n607\n00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,650\nThen Apple did what?\n\n608\n00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,800\nIt kind of had that lull,\nthat dip in there where it almost died.\n\n609\n00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,360\nThat company almost was dead.\n\n610\n00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,428\nNot many people buying their stuff.\n\n611\n00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:12,011\n>> Microsoft came in and\nsaved the day if I remember right.\n\n612\n00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:13,770\n>> Yeah,\nMicrosoft had a big role to play in that.\n\n613\n00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,076\nSo take that.\n\n614\n00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:17,956\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So but you know.\n\n615\n00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:20,666\n>> We're going to start all\nkinds of fan wars out there now.\n\n616\n00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:23,776\n>> Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK] Yeah bring it I'll show you\n\n617\n00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,324\nhow to de-authorize\npeople on this chat room.\n\n618\n00:27:27,324 --> 00:27:28,677\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n619\n00:27:28,677 --> 00:27:30,581\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n620\n00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,027\n>> So, you know, what, you know,\n\n621\n00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:35,400\nwhat happened is that, there was,\nI mean when you had that loll in there.\n\n622\n00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,773\n>> Right\n>> There wasn't a lot of, you know,\n\n623\n00:27:36,773 --> 00:27:38,410\nyou know, Apple computers out there.\n\n624\n00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:41,170\nIt's not, it's not a big enough target for\nme as, for\n\n625\n00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,470\nme as an attacker to make a huge splash.\n\n626\n00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:47,100\nYeah, there is going to be people who\nattack it, but it's, it's just not that.\n\n627\n00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,040\nI'm going to go over to the PC world, you\nknow, but, you know, what happened when\n\n628\n00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,550\nyou know, they had that resurgence and\nyou know, jobs came back and they started\n\n629\n00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:59,640\nputting out all these nice, fancy systems\nand, and, and systems that people liked.\n\n630\n00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,080\nIt took a while, but\nonce the reached that critical mass,\n\n631\n00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,190\nas I like to say,\nthey started getting tapped.\n\n632\n00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,530\nThat, that's just the nature,\ndoesn't mean your,\n\n633\n00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,260\ndoesn't mean your system had any more or\nless flaws than it did before.\n\n634\n00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,340\nIt just means there's\nenough of you out there.\n\n635\n00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,440\nOr, or you make a tempting target now.\n\n636\n00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,220\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n637\n00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,330\nI mean, we, we've talked about the reason\nsome of these attackers do the things\n\n638\n00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:23,620\nthey do is for fame or notoriety or\nrecognition among their peers, and\n\n639\n00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,340\nthat means that I've got to hit\nmore than 10 computers, right,\n\n640\n00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,460\nI mean I've got to make a big splash,\nas you say, so.\n\n641\n00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,460\nOnce Apple made their place in the market\n\n642\n00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,840\nnow if I write a virus that's geared\ntowards Apple, somebody might notice.\n\n643\n00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,210\nWhereas way back in the past when Apple\nwasn't the big player that they are now\n\n644\n00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,040\nthere was no point in doing it cuz\nnobody would really notice what I did.\n\n645\n00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,820\nI'm gonna go for the.\n\n646\n00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,340\nFor the big fish, basically.\n\n647\n00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,880\n>> Yeah, it's, and the same thing\ntranslates over to, to, to BlueTooth.\n\n648\n00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,324\nOnce BlueTooth you know, got enough\ntraction out there, and there was enough\n\n649\n00:28:54,324 --> 00:28:58,918\nof it, enough of it in the, in the works,\nin the workplace and the world period.\n\n650\n00:28:58,918 --> 00:29:01,577\nYou know,\npeople are going to start attacking it and\n\n651\n00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:04,790\nthere were security researchers\nright away that said- Yeah.\n\n652\n00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,720\nWhen blue tooth came out it's like\nwe need to apply some security.\n\n653\n00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,080\nIt did prove a concept of things\nthat showed it could be exploited.\n\n654\n00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,285\nBut, we heard that age old,\nthat age old, you know,\n\n655\n00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:21,365\nwhatever on it yeah,\nor that, that it was a.\n\n656\n00:29:21,365 --> 00:29:22,955\nHey, you know, no one's going to.\n\n657\n00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:24,655\nYou know,\nwhy would anyone want to do that?\n\n658\n00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:26,335\nOr no one is going to do that.\n\n659\n00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:27,495\n>> Yeah.\n>> No one's gonna you know,\n\n660\n00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:30,645\nit's just the same thing as saying you\nknow, why did someone climb a mountain.\n\n661\n00:29:30,645 --> 00:29:31,435\nCuz it's there?\n\n662\n00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:31,995\n>> Cuz it's there.\n>> Yeah.\n\n663\n00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:32,845\nYou don't climb them.\n\n664\n00:29:32,845 --> 00:29:35,914\nYou don't climb Everest because there's\na McDonald's or Starbucks up there.\n\n665\n00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,665\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You climb it because you've\n\n666\n00:29:37,665 --> 00:29:39,530\ngot you know, you just want to climb it.\n\n667\n00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,280\nRight.\n>> So it's, it's,\n\n668\n00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,170\nit's kind of the same thing\nwith with with BlueTooth,\n\n669\n00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,900\nis that there was enough out there,\nit became a target, and\n\n670\n00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:50,040\nwe definitely have seen the,\nyou know, seen the results of that.\n\n671\n00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,600\nYou know.\n\n672\n00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,140\n>> Yeah.\nYou know, when you,\n\n673\n00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,950\nwhen you think about the,\n\n674\n00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,090\nthe origins of BlueTooth, it started out\nas a very short-range, very low speed,\n\n675\n00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:00,720\nI can't remember the bits per second that\nit was doing, but it was incredibly slow.\n\n676\n00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,760\nBut that was okay cuz when\nit first came out, I mean,\n\n677\n00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,470\nwhere you saw it was keyboards and\nmice, right?\n\n678\n00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:09,200\nWireless keyboards, wireless mice,\nshort range it wasn't,\n\n679\n00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,460\nreally security wasn't a concern.\n\n680\n00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,320\nBut then people thought, wow,\n\n681\n00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,640\nthis, this is cool technology, we could\nstart implementing it in other places.\n\n682\n00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,970\nGot a little more power, started getting\nheadsets, started getting faster,\n\n683\n00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,670\nstarted sending more data across it,\nand then it becomes a nice target.\n\n684\n00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:26,660\nAnd it's unfortunate that they didn't\nthink about security in the beginning, but\n\n685\n00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,160\nat that time, I just don't think it was.\n\n686\n00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,610\nYou would think with all we've\nlearned that security would be part of\n\n687\n00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,170\nevery development for these technologies\nbut it just isn't the case.\n\n688\n00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,730\n>> No.\n>> Not until it's needed.\n\n689\n00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,820\nRight.\nWhy spend the money,\n\n690\n00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,310\nwhy spend the time, adding the security\nuntil we find out there's a reason for it?\n\n691\n00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,820\nSo.\n\n692\n00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,860\n>> Ya.\nAnd, and, and I, and\n\n693\n00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,550\nI tell you bluetooth on, eh, you, to, to\nta, to, to add some other stuff to that.\n\n694\n00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,190\nBluetooth, ye, you know, people don't even\nuse the security measures that are there.\n\n695\n00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:53,810\n>> That's right.\n>> There til.\n\n696\n00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,040\nThey don't use nothing but,\nthat's why, you know, I saw in here,\n\n697\n00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,010\nYou hear about,\nabout the celebrities like getting hacked.\n\n698\n00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,515\nI had nothing to do with that.\n\n699\n00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:06,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But but\n\n700\n00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,565\nI'll show you some pictures if you want.\n\n701\n00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:11,740\n[LAUGH] So what have you heard?\n\n702\n00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,950\nSo but you know that, you know that's,\nthat's just one of many examples.\n\n703\n00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,890\nThat may not have been\nexactly the bluetooth but\n\n704\n00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,645\nit's just one of many examples\nthat have been out there.\n\n705\n00:31:22,645 --> 00:31:24,390\nAllright, well ladies and\ngentlemen, looking at our clock,\n\n706\n00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,620\nit's about time to take a break.\n\n707\n00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,550\nSo why don't we stop here.\n\n708\n00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,850\nAnd when we come back, we're going to\ncontinue on with Blue, Bluetooth and\n\n709\n00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,840\ntalk about some of the types\nof attacks that can be carried\n\n710\n00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,820\nout across that Bluetooth wireless.\n\n711\n00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,395\nSo stay tuned, we'll be right back.\n\n712\n00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:43,512\n[SOUND] [SOUND] Allright.\n\n713\n00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:47,624\nWelcome back ladies and gentlemen,\ncontinuing on with our wireless\n\n714\n00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:52,287\ngetting ready to dive into the world of\nbluetooth attacks so where do we start?\n\n715\n00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:54,400\nI mean, there's numerous many right?\n\n716\n00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,041\nA lot of terminology we\nneed to know as well.\n\n717\n00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,013\n>> Oh yeah.\nThere's, there's,\n\n718\n00:31:58,013 --> 00:31:59,726\nthere's a lot of things happening here in.\n\n719\n00:31:59,726 --> 00:32:01,398\nIn, in the bluetooth space.\n\n720\n00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:03,994\nIt's still, it's still kinda new But\nthere's some,\n\n721\n00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:06,882\nthere is still some neat stuff\nhappening there nonetheless.\n\n722\n00:32:06,882 --> 00:32:11,547\nSo, when we talk about Bluetooth\nthere's really, there, there's four,\n\n723\n00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:16,015\nthere's four types of attacks in\nthe world right now against Bluetooth.\n\n724\n00:32:16,015 --> 00:32:20,782\nAnd they each have their own little\napproach to monkeying with Bluetooth and\n\n725\n00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:23,125\nirritating the users of Bluetooth.\n\n726\n00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,160\n>> Right.\n\n727\n00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,300\n>> Yeah, so that's kind of the case there.\n\n728\n00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,280\nWhat we have is we have you\nlook at our four attacks.\n\n729\n00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,980\nEach one of these attacks,\nit does something a little differently.\n\n730\n00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,630\nIt could tamper with the device,\nit could irritate the user of that device.\n\n731\n00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,300\nIt could intercept information.\n\n732\n00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,550\nIn fact in some cases it\ncan even alter information\n\n733\n00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,890\nwith these attacks which is\nactually really fascinating.\n\n734\n00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,700\nYou can alter stuff on someone's device\neven without them even knowing about it.\n\n735\n00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,445\nYou could,\nyou could reprogram their device so.\n\n736\n00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:56,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've got some pretty vicious stuff\n\n737\n00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:01,400\ncuz of the lack of security and some of\nthe bugs in some of the Bluetooth stacks\n\n738\n00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,590\nwhich is like the network\nstack we have withTCP/IP and\n\n739\n00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,830\nall that on the networking side.\n\n740\n00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,120\nThis is a, Bluetooth is a networking\ntechnology so it has its own specific\n\n741\n00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,210\nstack that you can also get into and\nperhaps do some nastiness with it.\n\n742\n00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:17,850\n>> Right, right.\n\n743\n00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,180\nAlright so what do we get, I guess we\ngot four major categories of attacks.\n\n744\n00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,540\nWe can do against Bluetooth.\n\n745\n00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,050\nOr using Bluetooth.\n\n746\n00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,080\nFirst one, blue jacking.\n\n747\n00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,090\n>> Yeah, blue jacking is a really\nkind of a, is a really kind of a,\n\n748\n00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,220\nis a really kind of a interesting one.\n\n749\n00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,035\nWhat blue jacking does is blue jacking\nis a, is really going out and kind of\n\n750\n00:33:38,035 --> 00:33:43,317\nsending, sending messages to someone's\ndevice and causing it to, and causing\n\n751\n00:33:43,317 --> 00:33:48,910\nthem just to kind of get unsolicited\nmessages, going what the heck is that.\n\n752\n00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,380\nIt was one of the earliest forms\nof attacks that you could,\n\n753\n00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,060\nthat you had is that someone would\ngo through and scan the area for\n\n754\n00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,690\nBluetooth devices and\ntap a few buttons on it and\n\n755\n00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,710\nbe able to send messages to you and\nyou'd get unsolicited messages.\n\n756\n00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,370\nBasically, the Bluetooth form of spam.\n\n757\n00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,950\nInterestingly enough this is actually,\nthe same technique is actually being\n\n758\n00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:15,800\nused by advertisers to send messages,\nto send messages to you.\n\n759\n00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,580\nThere's these little devices that\nstores can get that they can put\n\n760\n00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,870\nin their front windows.\n\n761\n00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:23,230\nThat can if you walk within range\nof Bluetooth enabled which is just\n\n762\n00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,340\nbasically everybody,\nmight as well say everybody.\n\n763\n00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,070\n>> Right.\n\n764\n00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:29,150\n>> That when they walk by, it would\nsend a message going hey, come on in,\n\n765\n00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,250\nthere's a sale on or whatever on that.\n\n766\n00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:36,320\nYou don't see a ton of it but\nit actually is out there in the wild.\n\n767\n00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,310\nAnd it relies on, there's really nothing,\n\n768\n00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,910\nthere's really a lack of\nsecurity in Bluetooth.\n\n769\n00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:44,480\n>> Yeah I know one of\nthe restaurants here in town, Moe's,\n\n770\n00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,070\nit's a Tex -Mex type joint.\n\n771\n00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,818\nAnd next to it is another Mexican\njoint that's even better I think.\n\n772\n00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:50,560\nBut, sorry Moe's.\n\n773\n00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,440\nBut I know that I signed up for\none of the rewards programs.\n\n774\n00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,290\nFrequent diner type thing,\nget some free food out of them.\n\n775\n00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,640\nAnd I was going to the restaurant\nnext door one time and\n\n776\n00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,600\nall of a sudden my phone pops up\nan advertisement Who knows, hey,\n\n777\n00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,450\ncome on in we got you a coupon,\nthat type of thing.\n\n778\n00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:06,730\nAnd it was just because I was within\nthat range of their restaurant,\n\n779\n00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,510\nthey detected me being there and started\nand popping up messages on my phone.\n\n780\n00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,250\nThey target it directly towards\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n781\n00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,774\n>> Towards the competition exactly.\n\n782\n00:35:13,774 --> 00:35:15,810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Which I immediately disabled on my\n\n783\n00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,035\nphone and uninstalled their app so,\nsorry Moe's.\n\n784\n00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:21,380\nAre you seeing other Mexican restaurant?\n\n785\n00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,940\nNo.\n\n786\n00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,920\n>> No.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n787\n00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,095\n>> We see you.\n\n788\n00:35:24,095 --> 00:35:27,370\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n789\n00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:32,710\nblue jacking is maybe one of the,\nI don't want to say less harmful ones,\n\n790\n00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:35,255\nbut it's one of the more mild\nmannered attacks, right?\n\n791\n00:35:35,255 --> 00:35:37,470\nCuz really, like you said,\nwe're annoying that user.\n\n792\n00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,730\nWe're popping up a message on their\nphone that they didn't ask for and\n\n793\n00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:43,690\nthose messages could range from\nvery benign to very nasty so,\n\n794\n00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,820\nI mean, that could get irritating there.\n\n795\n00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,630\n>> Yeah.\n>> But we're not talking,\n\n796\n00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,615\nwith blue jacking,\n\n797\n00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:50,890\ncuz I always have trouble remembering\nthe difference between each one.\n\n798\n00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:54,550\nSo blue jacking, we're really not\nstealing any data at this point,\n\n799\n00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,530\nwe're not taking over their device, we're\njust popping in messages on their device.\n\n800\n00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,340\n>> Yeah, just, just to tick them off.\n\n801\n00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,270\nIt's, is what I really look at it\nis it would tick me off if someone\n\n802\n00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,580\ndid this to me.\n\n803\n00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,180\nBut yeah.\n\n804\n00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,280\nYou're, you're putting\nunsolicited messages on there.\n\n805\n00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,480\nIt's the, it's the equivalent of spam.\n\n806\n00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,550\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's, that's really all it is.\n\n807\n00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,200\nSpam.\n\n808\n00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,660\nYou know, I know sometimes they,\nthey classify spam as an attack.\n\n809\n00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,328\nI don't classify spam as an attack,\nunless you're eating the stuff.\n\n810\n00:36:18,328 --> 00:36:20,313\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [NOISE] All right, [INAUDIBLE].\n\n811\n00:36:20,313 --> 00:36:25,029\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So but yeah, yeah, I don't consider it\n\n812\n00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,633\ndestructive or any sort of\n>> Right.\n\n813\n00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,750\n>> [INAUDIBLE] thing in that,\nin that area.\n\n814\n00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,190\n>> Yeah.\nAll right, so we got blue jacking.\n\n815\n00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,457\nAnd then one other category we need\nto talk about is blue smacking.\n\n816\n00:36:34,457 --> 00:36:35,383\nI love these names.\n\n817\n00:36:35,383 --> 00:36:36,423\n>> Yeah.\n>> Blue smacking [NOISE].\n\n818\n00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:39,123\n>> Yeah, that's when you\ngotta keep a Smurf in line.\n\n819\n00:36:39,123 --> 00:36:43,970\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> That's right,\nI went there people.\n\n820\n00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:51,870\nSo it's basically the crashing or locking\nup a device, is what that one's doing.\n\n821\n00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,550\nAnd it's, it is effective,\nsome of them are vulnerable to this.\n\n822\n00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,450\nSo that can be a little more,\na little more annoying.\n\n823\n00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,080\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you get,\n\n824\n00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,750\nif you become a victim of that.\n\n825\n00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,610\n>> So, somebody sending a signal to my,\nmy phone or my whatever my device is,\n\n826\n00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,930\nthat's Bluetooth-enabled, and they're\nbasically trying to crash the device.\n\n827\n00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> So not really steal any data\n\n828\n00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:11,980\nat this point.\n\n829\n00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,010\nBut just make it, do a denial of service\ntype of attack on that Bluetooth device.\n\n830\n00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,150\nWhether that's a headset, a phone,\nor whatever the case may be.\n\n831\n00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:24,090\nWhich, which is scary as we see Bluetooth\nand more and more and more devices\n\n832\n00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,540\nwith the fact that they could might be\nable to reach out, touch it, shut it down.\n\n833\n00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,950\nEspecially if it's something that,\nthat's driving my car for\n\n834\n00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:30,930\nme, those kind of things.\n\n835\n00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,540\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> Pretty scary.\n\n836\n00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,990\nSo, so blue smacking.\n\n837\n00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,190\nThen we got blue sniffing.\n\n838\n00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:39,320\nAnd that one I think the name kind\nof tells you what it's doing.\n\n839\n00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,940\n>> Yeah, gives it away, yeah.\n\n840\n00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,060\nIt's just intercepted information.\n\n841\n00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,670\nFascinatingly enough, there's actually\nBluetooth can actually work with some\n\n842\n00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:54,490\nof the, you can Bluetooth enable some of\nthe more common packet sniffers out there.\n\n843\n00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,330\nUnder the right conditions, you can\nenable Wire Shark even to do Bluetooth\n\n844\n00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:01,240\nsniffing if you have a Bluetooth\nadapter that allows this sort of thing.\n\n845\n00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,540\nYou can, you can start intercepting\ntraffic on this and reading it.\n\n846\n00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,470\n>> Yeah,\nbecause it is just a 2.4 RF frequency.\n\n847\n00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> The problem is do I\n\n848\n00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,940\nhave an antenna that will receive that and\nreceive it in a promiscuous mode\n\n849\n00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,925\nthen I might be able to start\ngrabbing some of that information.\n\n850\n00:38:17,925 --> 00:38:21,175\n>> Yeah it,\nit's still an emerging area but yeah,\n\n851\n00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:25,667\nwe're getting it, we, we still, we can\nsee that yes there are ways to intercept\n\n852\n00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:30,545\nBluetooth traffic so\nkeep your eyes on that\n\n853\n00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:34,685\none cuz that one is already out there in\nthe wild just being refined right now.\n\n854\n00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:37,035\n>> Right, and being a shorter\nrange technology that means they,\n\n855\n00:38:37,035 --> 00:38:39,540\nthey might have to get a little\ncloser to you to get that but\n\n856\n00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,198\nas we're gonna see later, there are things\nwe could do to pick that up even further.\n\n857\n00:38:44,198 --> 00:38:48,860\nSo blue sniffing, grabbing that data or\ntrying to intercept information that's\n\n858\n00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,120\nbeing transmitted using some\ntype of Bluetooth technology.\n\n859\n00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,010\nAnd then the fourth one\nis the bluesnarfing.\n\n860\n00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,940\nBluesnarfing, another great name.\n\n861\n00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,400\n>> Yeah, this is, this is probably\nthe nastiest one of the bunch, really,\n\n862\n00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,266\nwhen you talk about bluesnarfing.\n\n863\n00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:10,210\nBluesnarfing is when you connect to\na device and you start modifying it.\n\n864\n00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,130\nUnder the right conditions, let's just\nsay you're talking to a cell phone.\n\n865\n00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:18,385\nIf you talk to a cell phone and\nyou're using bluesnarfing,\n\n866\n00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:22,420\nwhat's gonna happen is, is that you\ncan not only read information on it,\n\n867\n00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,150\nit's possible to replace\nstuff on that device with it.\n\n868\n00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,120\nI've seen it where,\n\n869\n00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,870\nthey, I've seen it where someone's\nread text messages on the phone.\n\n870\n00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,670\nWhere someone has read call lists and\nthings like that.\n\n871\n00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,580\nAnd then they've even read the phone\nbook and then wiped it and\n\n872\n00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,115\nuploaded a new phone book to the device,\nall behind the owner's back.\n\n873\n00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:48,420\nSo, and, and something I like\nto point out with this is that,\n\n874\n00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,190\nhow many people do you see that actually\nuse the little Bluetooth clip-ons and\n\n875\n00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,150\nthey keep their phone in their pocket?\n\n876\n00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,600\n>> Everybody's got their friend, right,\n\n877\n00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,100\nthat cannot go anywhere without their\nfricking transformer device in their ear?\n\n878\n00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,600\n>> Yeah.\n>> I mean, why?\n\n879\n00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,055\nAre you really that important that\n\n880\n00:40:02,055 --> 00:40:05,316\nyou gotta have that phone in your ear at\nall times as you're standing in line at\n\n881\n00:40:05,316 --> 00:40:07,618\nthe store in front of me?\nOn things like that.\n\n882\n00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:08,878\nBut yeah, those are people that I\n\n883\n00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:10,078\nwant to go for.\n[LAUGH]\n\n884\n00:40:10,078 --> 00:40:10,623\n>> Yeah.\n\n885\n00:40:10,623 --> 00:40:12,465\nYeah, they're the ones that you're going\n\n886\n00:40:12,465 --> 00:40:14,691\nto get.\nBecause I have heard that argument before.\n\n887\n00:40:14,691 --> 00:40:15,720\nIt's like what if.\n\n888\n00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,180\nIf you, did blue scarfing or\n\n889\n00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,900\nsomething against me I'm going to see\nmy phone light up and stuff like that.\n\n890\n00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,100\nYou know, are you really?\n\n891\n00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,880\nYou probably have that little\nblugie thing in there, and\n\n892\n00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,130\nthat thing never comes out of your pocket.\n\n893\n00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:25,830\n>> Right.\n\n894\n00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:27,310\n>> Yeah, so\nyou're not going to see anything.\n\n895\n00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,660\nYou're not going to hear a click,\nor anything like that.\n\n896\n00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,050\nYou'll, all of a sudden you're gonna,\nyou're stuck.\n\n897\n00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,130\nThis isn't going to be there.\n\n898\n00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,240\nI'm going to be reading it.\n\n899\n00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,950\nHeck, I can even use\nthe device of the modem.\n\n900\n00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,310\nAll you have to do is unplug your head\ngear, or your head set, which is very,\n\n901\n00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,720\nvery easy to do once you have\nthat level of access and\n\n902\n00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,190\nthen just hook my stuff into it and\nstart you know,\n\n903\n00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,120\ntransmitting stuff to it\nto use it like a modem.\n\n904\n00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,650\n>> RIght, if you think about all\nthe things we use our smart phones and our\n\n905\n00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,610\ntablets for nowadays, you know, our users,\nagain, they'll put sensitive information\n\n906\n00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,780\nthat, you know, that shouldn't really be\non that phone in the first place, because\n\n907\n00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,460\nit's not the most secure device typically\n>> And\n\n908\n00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,620\nsomebody can gain access to that,\nyou know?\n\n909\n00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,960\nAnything that you've saved\non that phone you know,\n\n910\n00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,500\ntake advantage of connections you\ngot established on that phone.\n\n911\n00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,350\nRead through all your contact information.\n\n912\n00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:22,040\nStart calling your clients and\ntrying to get you to switch over to their\n\n913\n00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,320\nthe list of things they could do\nwith that information is endless.\n\n914\n00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,420\nSo very, very scary.\n\n915\n00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,210\n>> I had a good question out there.\n\n916\n00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:31,630\nI don't know if we can find it again.\n\n917\n00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:38,869\n[NOISE] So\nis it good to put VPN on your device?\n\n918\n00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:41,385\nI do.\nDo you use Hands off your devices?\n\n919\n00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:42,865\n>> Yeah, wherever possible I do, yeah.\n\n920\n00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:44,585\nIt just makes sense.\n\n921\n00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,495\n>> Yeah, but it, it's,\nyou know, I'm not gonna,\n\n922\n00:41:46,495 --> 00:41:48,515\nI don't think I can really VPN\nin my headset or anything, but\n\n923\n00:41:48,515 --> 00:41:51,685\nif I was transmitting important\ninformation out of my VPN,\n\n924\n00:41:51,685 --> 00:41:56,805\ninto my workplace, and\ndo that there's another one up there,\n\n925\n00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,895\nwell I'll come back to some\nof those questions there.\n\n926\n00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,090\nExcuse me.\n\n927\n00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,000\nAll right so we've got four\ndifferent major categories in there\n\n928\n00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,080\nthat we really need to make sure we\nunderstand that terminology for.\n\n929\n00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,790\nWe got that blue jacking and\ngosh I've already forgot.\n\n930\n00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:15,840\nBlue jacking is where we're\ngoing to spam them, right?\n\n931\n00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,130\nWe're gonna throw up\nmessages up on their phone.\n\n932\n00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,210\nUhnsolicited messages.\n\n933\n00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,270\nBlue smacking, we're going to try to\ndisable that bluetooth device or crash it.\n\n934\n00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:27,870\nBlue sniffing,\nwhere we're trying to capture data or\n\n935\n00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,430\ninformation being\ntransmitted via bluetooth.\n\n936\n00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,010\nAnd then blue snarfing, where we try\nto take control of their device.\n\n937\n00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,480\nAnd basically get access to everything\nthey have or whatever we want.\n\n938\n00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,000\nOn that phone.\n\n939\n00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,940\nSo a few different categories of attacks\nyou need to be familiar with and\n\n940\n00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,862\nbe able to differentiate between,\nfor our bluetooth attacks.\n\n941\n00:42:45,862 --> 00:42:46,492\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n942\n00:42:46,492 --> 00:42:48,209\n>> [SOUND] All right,\nso more about attacks.\n\n943\n00:42:48,209 --> 00:42:50,947\nWe're gonna move on into some\nof the tools we're gonna use.\n\n944\n00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:55,117\nI know I've seen a few people out there\ncommenting on a few different tools you\n\n945\n00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,602\nwanna hit that direction.\n\n946\n00:42:56,602 --> 00:42:57,340\n>> Yeah, let's do it.\n\n947\n00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,030\n>> All right.\n>> Let's talk about the different types\n\n948\n00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,680\nof things that we, you know,\nwe have available.\n\n949\n00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,130\nYou know there's a number of bluetooth, of\nthe, tools available on the software side.\n\n950\n00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:10,140\nYou know, you can just, you know,\ntype in things like bluetooth scanner,\n\n951\n00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,370\nstuff like that.\n\n952\n00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:16,480\nI know Medieval has one that can sweep\nthe area and find bluetooth devices.\n\n953\n00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,870\nThere's a few on the Linux side, like,\n\n954\n00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:24,560\nBT Scanner that can find bluetooth devices\nfor you, so you've got a good number.\n\n955\n00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,686\nIn fact, Linux has some really\ngood tools for doing for\n\n956\n00:43:27,686 --> 00:43:32,590\nlocating bluetooth devices,\nidentifying the device IDs.\n\n957\n00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:33,120\nAnd then you,\n\n958\n00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:38,180\nthey have blue starfin utilities that will\nlie to go the next step if you choose.\n\n959\n00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:41,930\nYou know so they've pretty much\ngot that flushed out pretty well.\n\n960\n00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:43,570\nBut there are other tools and\n\n961\n00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,330\nthere's tools on the windows\nside that work very well, too.\n\n962\n00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:52,330\nThe problem traditionally has you\nknow the problem traditionally has\n\n963\n00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,070\nbeen a lot of the bluetooth\ntools were kind of expensive.\n\n964\n00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:55,640\n>> Mm.\n>> And, you know,\n\n965\n00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,620\nit used to be that some of these\nthings worked a range of thousands\n\n966\n00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,650\nof dollars to really do pen\ntesting with them effectively.\n\n967\n00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,460\nSo if you're gonna be pen testing\na lot of bluetooth devices,\n\n968\n00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:07,202\nyou kinda had to bite the bullet.\n\n969\n00:44:07,202 --> 00:44:08,340\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> [LAUGH] and spend the money for\n\n970\n00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:10,320\nthe devi- for that equipment.\n\n971\n00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,752\nNowadays you know, I saw someone mention\nin the chat rooms about the Ubertooth.\n\n972\n00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:19,500\nOne device, you can find that\nUbertooth is a little hardware\n\n973\n00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:24,650\ndevice about yay big and it's they,\nthey call it an experimental device.\n\n974\n00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,635\nBut that's really not fare\nto say experimental device.\n\n975\n00:44:27,635 --> 00:44:28,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n976\n00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,500\n>> It actually is very\n>> Functional, and\n\n977\n00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:35,560\nthere is software utilities and stuff like\nthat will, lets you plug into that and\n\n978\n00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,630\nscan and\nyou can do some pretty amazing stuff.\n\n979\n00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,640\nBut you don't have to\nuse something like that.\n\n980\n00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,790\nThat's actually not a bad\ntool to have in your arsenal.\n\n981\n00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,920\nBut there are other things out there,\ntoo, that can allow you to do, you know,\n\n982\n00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,985\nsome pretty neat stuff.\n\n983\n00:44:48,985 --> 00:44:49,490\n>> Mm-mm.\n>> You know.\n\n984\n00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:49,999\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n985\n00:44:49,999 --> 00:44:51,009\n>> So they've kind of taken it out of\n\n986\n00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:54,050\nthat several, you know,\nseveral thousand dollar range.\n\n987\n00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:55,990\n>> Means you can do it for much cheaper.\n\n988\n00:44:55,990 --> 00:45:02,303\nThe Ubertooth one, I believe is runs just\na little bit over, a shade over, $100 US.\n\n989\n00:45:02,303 --> 00:45:06,920\nIt's about $110,\nyou can get it in several places.\n\n990\n00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,880\n>> And real quick,\nI hate to interrupt you.\n\n991\n00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,060\nI posted a link to SourceForge, it looks\nlike they moved that over to GitHub.\n\n992\n00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:18,570\nSo let me throw up another link there\nto that Uber tooth information,\n\n993\n00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,340\nfor you guys out there.\n\n994\n00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,300\n>> Yeah.\n\n995\n00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,150\nYou can also just Google Ubertooth and\nyou'll find several places for it, so\n\n996\n00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,140\nif you want to do price shopping on it,\nusually it's gonna be,\n\n997\n00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,230\nit's gonna be, at least 100, but\nif you're paying more, than,\n\n998\n00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,560\npaying more than 120 for it, you know,\nyou're probably paying too much for that.\n\n999\n00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,010\nBut it, but\nit is actually something out there.\n\n1000\n00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:41,490\nAnd if you're going to be doing pentesting\nwith bluetooth or you have a lot of mobile\n\n1001\n00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,590\ndevices that you're going to be pentesting\nagainst, it's really not a bad investment.\n\n1002\n00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:47,460\nIt's pretty cheap considering.\n\n1003\n00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,050\n>> Right.\n\n1004\n00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:53,560\n>> But there are other, there are other\nthings, you know out there to use.\n\n1005\n00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,960\nYou know, one that I,\nyou know meant, you that,\n\n1006\n00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,240\nthat I was kind of referencing here\na bit is one called this the pone pad.\n\n1007\n00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:00,740\nHm.\n\n1008\n00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,450\n>> You know, it was kind of discussing\nthis and let me pull my adapter off here.\n\n1009\n00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:10,550\nThis is the first thing\nI kinda wanna show.\n\n1010\n00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,210\nThis is a Blue,\n\n1011\n00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:16,610\nthis is a Bluetooth adapter this could do\nmore than the standard the adapter can.\n\n1012\n00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:20,230\nThis could do all the, you know,\nall the associations and\n\n1013\n00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,740\npairings of Bluetooth devices.\n\n1014\n00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:26,580\nBut, it also has a pretty\ngood range on it, too.\n\n1015\n00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:31,400\nYou can actually unscrew this antennae and\nput different antennas onto it.\n\n1016\n00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,660\nIt supports packet injection which\nmost bluetooth do not support that so\n\n1017\n00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:40,570\nthis one will do that, allow you to place\npackets on a bluetooth connection to do\n\n1018\n00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,780\nmodifications and\nmodified pairings and stuff like that.\n\n1019\n00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:50,220\nOn top of it, you know, we said that\nbluetooth has about a 30 foot range.\n\n1020\n00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,650\nThis has a 1,000 foot range.\n\n1021\n00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:53,150\nSo.\n\n1022\n00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:59,090\nYeah, I can change, I can really kind\nof change the nature of stuff on it.\n\n1023\n00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,130\n>> Right.\n>> In fact with the right antenna\n\n1024\n00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,660\nyou can get this one up to they say,\nand I find it kind of unbelievable.\n\n1025\n00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,440\nSome people have gotten this\nup to a 5000 foot range.\n\n1026\n00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,490\n>> What is the name of that device,\n\n1027\n00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,320\nI want to make sure everybody,\n>> This is a.\n\n1028\n00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,264\n>> UD1000, or UD100 by Sena,\n\n1029\n00:47:17,264 --> 00:47:21,156\nS-E-N-A.\n\n1030\n00:47:21,156 --> 00:47:24,710\nSo, but you've got something,\nyou've got those available.\n\n1031\n00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:31,930\nNow why I have it is because this is a\nLinux based device so I can't really plug\n\n1032\n00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,080\nit in here and demo it, but I'll just kind\nof show you guys what's going on here.\n\n1033\n00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,990\nNo Scott, that is the Ubertooth,\nUbertooth is something different and\n\n1034\n00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,180\nthe, that device can actually be\nused on Windows and Linux, anything.\n\n1035\n00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,730\nYou just have to have\na way to plug into it.\n\n1036\n00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:52,510\nIt's a bluetooth adapter, just look at\nit that way, it is a bluetooth adapter,\n\n1037\n00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,995\nit does have some additional\ncapabilities on it.\n\n1038\n00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:59,298\n>> But it's a bluetooth adapter period.\n\n1039\n00:47:59,298 --> 00:48:03,800\nThe question is that when you put blue,\nthe question is when you plug it into\n\n1040\n00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,801\na system The software that you use\nin the interface with it, does,\n\n1041\n00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:12,246\ndoes allow you the ability to access\nthe packet injection capabilities.\n\n1042\n00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:13,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1043\n00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:15,940\n>> That's,\nthat's where you're going with that.\n\n1044\n00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,290\nSo something you know something also\nI saw here this discussion group.\n\n1045\n00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,790\nHe didn't know blue someone said they\ndidn't know bluetooth was in the clear,\n\n1046\n00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:24,650\nBrian said he didn't know\nbluetooth was in the clear.\n\n1047\n00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,520\nBluetooth doesn't have to be in,\nyou know, in, in the, in the clear.\n\n1048\n00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:32,240\nThat's the thing, it doesn't have to be.\n\n1049\n00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,970\nIt's up to the manufacturer to\nchose if they want to implement\n\n1050\n00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,950\ncryptographic protocols in there.\n\n1051\n00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,110\nAnd, it's, you know the way it works.\n\n1052\n00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,160\nThat's extra work.\n\n1053\n00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,740\nYou know, so, they may not do it.\n\n1054\n00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:45,590\nIf they decide, you know, we're not,\nthat's not a feature what we\n\n1055\n00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,256\nneed to implement,\nin which case you've got a problem.\n\n1056\n00:48:48,256 --> 00:48:49,736\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1057\n00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:53,430\n>> So, just, just,\njust the way that works.\n\n1058\n00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,750\nBut no, and in case I'm using\nthat with this guy right here,\n\n1059\n00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,540\nthis is what they call a Pwn Pad.\n\n1060\n00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,247\nYou can look it up,\nPwnie Express makes this thing.\n\n1061\n00:49:02,247 --> 00:49:07,190\nSo I'll admit,\nit's not a cheap device, you\n\n1062\n00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:11,700\ncould make your own as a couple of people\nin the discussion groups have mentioned.\n\n1063\n00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,500\nIf you get it made by Pwnie Express\npreconfigured and everything,\n\n1064\n00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,340\nthey give you the adapters.\n\n1065\n00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,440\nWith it.\nYou know, you can see I've got, you know,\n\n1066\n00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,010\nthe, the USB cable,\nthat allows to me to plug in.\n\n1067\n00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:26,070\nPlus the the, the, network adapter\nthat does packet injections for wifi.\n\n1068\n00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,060\nAnd then the bluetooth\nadapter I just showed you.\n\n1069\n00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,380\nThey include both that, and\nthey include training with it, too,\n\n1070\n00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,570\njust in case you need that.\n\n1071\n00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:33,605\nIt does run about 1200 bucks.\n\n1072\n00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:34,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know, so\n\n1073\n00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:36,630\nit's not a cheap piece of hardware.\n\n1074\n00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:42,060\nThe cool thing about this is that you,\nsomething like this, and you can imagine\n\n1075\n00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:45,580\nthe, me carrying something around,\nlike this and just kind of looking at it.\n\n1076\n00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,510\nPeople think I'm reading like a Kindle or\nmessing around on my, on my tablet,\n\n1077\n00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,280\nthey don't know this, they, they don't\nknow what's actually going on, they\n\n1078\n00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,130\ndon't know if this has a Linux destroy\non it that can really ruin your day as.\n\n1079\n00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:57,195\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A network builder.\n\n1080\n00:49:57,195 --> 00:49:59,620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, yeah, yeah, I can reach out,\n\n1081\n00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,320\nI can, I can.\n\n1082\n00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,920\n>> I can reach out a distance and and,\nand, and nail your bluetooth devices.\n\n1083\n00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,480\n>> Hm.\n>> You can also do stuff with the Wi-Fi\n\n1084\n00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:07,990\non this too.\n\n1085\n00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,460\nThis has the ability to do all\nsorts of nice stuff with Wi-Fi,\n\n1086\n00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,460\nincluding, you know, y, you know,\n\n1087\n00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:19,100\npushing just a few buttons to have it\nautomatically crack WEP and WPA for you.\n\n1088\n00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,310\n>> Mm.\n>> It'll do, it'll do that.\n\n1089\n00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,680\nAll you got to do is tap tap and,\nyou know, just go about, and\n\n1090\n00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,770\ngo about your thing and it will do that.\n\n1091\n00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,785\nAnd then it even has the ability, there's,\nthere's actually utilities on this.\n\n1092\n00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:30,725\nThat can do stuff.\n\n1093\n00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:33,795\nIt can do specialized man in the middle\nattacks where it will actually strip\n\n1094\n00:50:33,795 --> 00:50:35,885\noff the wrapper on SSL connections.\n\n1095\n00:50:35,885 --> 00:50:37,495\n>> Wow.\n>> And show you the bare,\n\n1096\n00:50:37,495 --> 00:50:39,185\nraw connection with\nthe data underneath it.\n\n1097\n00:50:39,185 --> 00:50:39,765\n>> Mm.\n>> So,\n\n1098\n00:50:39,765 --> 00:50:42,940\nfinds those flaws and\nin it, they can do that.\n\n1099\n00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:44,510\n>> And that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n1100\n00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:48,770\nYou know, so,\nthis has some pretty neat stuff on it.\n\n1101\n00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:52,150\nSo if, if you, if you're gonna to be\ngetting hardcore into PIN testing,\n\n1102\n00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,910\nit's not bad to have something like this.\n\n1103\n00:50:55,088 --> 00:51:01,149\nFYI, you don't have to pay the 1200 bucks\nyou could steal it like [LAUGH] So, hey.\n\n1104\n00:51:01,149 --> 00:51:03,390\n>> [LAUGH] You know,\nI think maybe we should od our own.\n\n1105\n00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:06,320\n>> Show on that and, and,\nif enough of you guys request it maybe I\n\n1106\n00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,940\ncan get them to buy me\none here at IT Pro TV.\n\n1107\n00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,900\n>> Dude, totally.\n\n1108\n00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's the best excuse to get one free\n\n1109\n00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,091\nthat I ever heard of.\n\n1110\n00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:14,906\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1111\n00:51:14,906 --> 00:51:17,529\n>> Well, yeah but and\nthe thing is that you don't have to,\n\n1112\n00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:21,360\nyou don't have to spend the 1,200\nbucks on something like this.\n\n1113\n00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,680\n>> I mean if you don't want, if you don't\nhave the time to, to do all that and\n\n1114\n00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,700\nyou want to make sure it's done a certain\nway and you get all the extra bells and\n\n1115\n00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,870\nwhistles, then, yeah, by all means,\npay, you know, pay the money.\n\n1116\n00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:35,510\nIt's 1200 or 1000 or something like that.\n\n1117\n00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:37,140\nBut, you can do that.\n\n1118\n00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,900\n>> Or there's actually\ninstructions on how to do this.\n\n1119\n00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:44,720\nYou can get a, there's a community edition\nof the software that they put on this\n\n1120\n00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,400\nthat you can, they tell you how\nto flash the, flash the device.\n\n1121\n00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,375\nThey'll tell you specifically what device\nto get, and the characteristics it has\n\n1122\n00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:55,915\nto meet, and then boom, you can just\ndo it, you can do it on your own.\n\n1123\n00:51:55,915 --> 00:51:59,275\nAnd that's probably gonna cost you,\nyou know, maybe about half of this,\n\n1124\n00:51:59,275 --> 00:52:04,247\nbut you need to be tech, technically\nsavvy, but you know, everyone here\n\n1125\n00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:06,787\nprobably meets that category, so\nI don't think that's a problem.\n\n1126\n00:52:06,787 --> 00:52:09,617\nYou just, it just becomes a hobby for you.\n\n1127\n00:52:09,617 --> 00:52:13,037\nSo, and of course, you'll have to get the,\nyou know, the adapters and\n\n1128\n00:52:13,037 --> 00:52:15,578\nall that stuff like that, but\nthat's not a big problem.\n\n1129\n00:52:15,578 --> 00:52:18,808\nI don't know, somebody in the chat room\nwas asking on the range of that, and\n\n1130\n00:52:18,808 --> 00:52:21,378\nI think that probably has a lot to\ndo with the adapters you choose.\n\n1131\n00:52:21,378 --> 00:52:25,628\n>> Yeah, well, that, that's true, it does\nhave to do with the adapters you choose.\n\n1132\n00:52:25,628 --> 00:52:29,004\nYou may be asking, you know,\nwhy, you know, why these ones?\n\n1133\n00:52:29,004 --> 00:52:32,704\nAnd not use the built in ones,\ncuz this tablet does have a,\n\n1134\n00:52:32,704 --> 00:52:36,254\nI think it's a Nexus 6 or\n5 or something like that.\n\n1135\n00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:40,294\nThis thing does have built in\nbluetooth and built in wi-fi.\n\n1136\n00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,620\nThere's, there's no big secret there.\n\n1137\n00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,590\n>> But you know, why these guys?\n\n1138\n00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:48,870\nWell because the WiFi one that's\nbuilt into the device doesn't support\n\n1139\n00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:50,180\npacket injection.\n\n1140\n00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,330\nThis one does.\n\n1141\n00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,410\nAnd the Bluetooth one definitely\ndoesn't support packet injection.\n\n1142\n00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:56,875\nIn those, and\nthose special capabilities we need.\n\n1143\n00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,930\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> So, you need to have this one.\n\n1144\n00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:03,260\nThey will tie it specifically to the, the\nutilities in this specifically look for.\n\n1145\n00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:03,760\n>> Oh, okay.\n\n1146\n00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,835\n>> These two devices.\n\n1147\n00:53:04,835 --> 00:53:07,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can only have one plugged in at\n\n1148\n00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:12,300\na time just because of the way\nthe spec works on the device.\n\n1149\n00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:15,190\nBut doesn't really matter too much, but\nit will look for one of those ones, so\n\n1150\n00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:16,460\nyou're pretty much tied to those ones.\n\n1151\n00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:17,790\nBut that's alright.\n\n1152\n00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:22,650\nThat's fine, you can do\neverything you need to with this.\n\n1153\n00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:23,450\n>> I like that, yeah.\n\n1154\n00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:27,090\nI see a few votes coming in already, so\nDon, Tim, I hope you guys are watching.\n\n1155\n00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:30,182\nWe need a phone at the TPO TV Studio.\n\n1156\n00:53:30,182 --> 00:53:34,960\n>> And also, something else to ask Nate,\nNate beat me to the punch on there.\n\n1157\n00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,860\nIs that, yeah they,\nthey do have a phone version of it, too.\n\n1158\n00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:43,360\nSo, if you want smaller than that, and\nyou're where you can get the phone,\n\n1159\n00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:46,590\nthe phone is, is,\nis going to cost roughly about the same as\n\n1160\n00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:50,890\na tablet is if you buy it pre-made, but,\nagain, you can make that yourself, too.\n\n1161\n00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:56,380\nIf you can get a Nexus device off of eBay\nor something like that, you can it and\n\n1162\n00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:02,310\nload up all the tools on it, they'll give\nyou the whole instructions for that.\n\n1163\n00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:02,880\n>> Gotcha, nice, nice.\n\n1164\n00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,630\nAlright, so\na few different tools we've already seen,\n\n1165\n00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:07,100\nwe've got our got a lot of software,\nas you were saying.\n\n1166\n00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,560\nThere's a phone pad,\nother things we might do to,\n\n1167\n00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,470\ngot to get it out of my mouth here,\nother types of tasks, or\n\n1168\n00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:20,730\nbasically we can modify devices to carry\nout these kind of attacks, maybe changing\n\n1169\n00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:26,350\nout our antennas we may have mentioned,\nmaking modifications to our devices yes,\n\n1170\n00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:30,700\nthere, there are,\nthere are numerous things you can do.\n\n1171\n00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,410\nProbably the biggest one worth,\n\n1172\n00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:38,260\npointing out at this point is is\nthe idea of making your own antennas.\n\n1173\n00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:42,270\nYou can go on to on, on,\nyou know, onto Google and\n\n1174\n00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:45,860\nyou can Google something called\nBluetooth from a Mile Away.\n\n1175\n00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:49,900\nIt was a,\nit was in Popular Science some years ago.\n\n1176\n00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,930\nIt is actually a pretty\nneat demonstration and\n\n1177\n00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:58,190\na project you can do that you can\nactually enhance the range of bluetooth,\n\n1178\n00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:01,570\nif you want,\nunder the right conditions you can do it.\n\n1179\n00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,310\nWhat they do is they outline, you know,\n\n1180\n00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:08,840\nhow to get a specific bluetooth adapter\nwith a specific type of antenna and,\n\n1181\n00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:14,130\nand maybe if you're handy with a soldering\niron you could in, maybe, you know,\n\n1182\n00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:19,110\n20 minutes you could create a bluetooth\nadapter with an antenna that will increase\n\n1183\n00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:23,670\nyour range, you know, several orders\nof magnitude it will increase.\n\n1184\n00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,169\nI mean, you're talking ranges going\nfrom 30 feet up to thousands of feet\n\n1185\n00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,250\nIt probably is not going to\ndo a mile because Bluetooth\n\n1186\n00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,690\nthe normal Bluetooth you have and some of\nthe Bluetooth you guys may have out there,\n\n1187\n00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:43,450\njust do not have that power\nbehind it to drive, that stuff,\n\n1188\n00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:48,340\nbut if you do you can create one of\nthese devices, you know, really cheaply.\n\n1189\n00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:53,222\nI mean, you should be able to create\nthe thing for around $80 to $100, I think.\n\n1190\n00:55:53,222 --> 00:55:56,877\nTo, of equipment, and just, and\njust the time you have to invest in, in,\n\n1191\n00:55:56,877 --> 00:55:58,108\nin soldering the stuff.\n\n1192\n00:55:58,108 --> 00:56:02,521\nAnd you can just unplug the, or,\nun star the antenna, and the device, and\n\n1193\n00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:06,794\nthen sauter in leads for the,\nthe antenna the recommend, which is one of\n\n1194\n00:56:06,794 --> 00:56:11,233\nthose old cell phone antennas, with\nthe spring and coil and all that in it.\n\n1195\n00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:14,257\nUsed one of those and you can,\nyou know, increase your range and\n\n1196\n00:56:14,257 --> 00:56:16,105\nI've seen it in use and it's amazing.\n\n1197\n00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:17,935\nYou look at the before and after.\n\n1198\n00:56:17,935 --> 00:56:18,620\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know,\n\n1199\n00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:21,340\nwhen someone uses a normal blue\ntooth device to scan around and\n\n1200\n00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,870\nthen plug this thing in and all of\na sudden the whole building's visible.\n\n1201\n00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:27,510\nYeah, it's, it's, it's dramatic.\n\n1202\n00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,550\nYeah, so, there's, there's little\nthings you can do if you get,\n\n1203\n00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,570\nif you wanna get clever with it, you can\ndo stuff like that to increase your range\n\n1204\n00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,720\nand do some, pretty, pretty nice stuff.\n\n1205\n00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,290\n>> All right, and\n\n1206\n00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:40,060\nthen the last thing we really need to\ntalk about is, protective measures.\n\n1207\n00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,570\nAre we, can we, can we make\nourselves safe from snarfing and\n\n1208\n00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,070\nsmacking and all that fun stuff?\n\n1209\n00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,720\nYeah, there's you know, I, I, I definitely\ndo not wanna give the impression after\n\n1210\n00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,680\nwe've gone through all this wireless,\nyou know, stuff,\n\n1211\n00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,445\nyou know, terrorized you into\nnever using the technology.\n\n1212\n00:56:53,445 --> 00:56:54,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, that does,\n\n1213\n00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:57,470\nthat does happen in some cases\nwhere people are like well,\n\n1214\n00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:59,940\nno, I'm not using that now, you know.\n\n1215\n00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:03,620\nBut no, that's, that's the,\nthat's the wrong way to do it.\n\n1216\n00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,720\nThis is meant to, to inform you and\n\n1217\n00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:10,970\nto, let them tell you what you can do to,\nto work around these things.\n\n1218\n00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,980\nYou know, things you have,\nyou know, from the,\n\n1219\n00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,420\nfrom the get-go don't leave\nany of the defaults in place.\n\n1220\n00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,260\nThat's a very common thing with wireless,\npeople leave those in place you know,\n\n1221\n00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:23,330\nhave some sort of plan where you\ndo regular site surveys to see if,\n\n1222\n00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,650\nto see if there's any\nrogue access points or\n\n1223\n00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,380\nany, any devices that are aah,\naah you know, shouldn't be, you know,\n\n1224\n00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,410\ndoing, maybe shouldn't have\ntheir wireless enabled.\n\n1225\n00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:35,680\nThat's another, that's another good one.\n\n1226\n00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,150\nEducation of your employees.\n\n1227\n00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,320\nLet them know what is, you know,\nwhat's, what's proper to do and\n\n1228\n00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,500\nwhat's not proper to do.\n\n1229\n00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,380\nWhen you look at the technology,\n\n1230\n00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:48,650\nwe have things like we should\nnever be using WEP Or even the PA.\n\n1231\n00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:52,180\nWe should stay away from that\nif we have WPA2 available.\n\n1232\n00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,870\nIf you don't have WPA2, then it's WPA and\nthen if that's not available then yes,\n\n1233\n00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:57,970\nyou're gonna have to use WEP.\n\n1234\n00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:02,570\nAnd then you should also look at why you\ncan only use WEP and see about upgrading.\n\n1235\n00:58:02,570 --> 00:58:03,580\n>> Right.\n>> That would be the step,\n\n1236\n00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,300\nthat would be the step on that.\n\n1237\n00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,630\nYou know, other things,\nif you want to make it more secure.\n\n1238\n00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:13,010\nSome people are not secure with just\nusing, w, w, with, with just using WPA2.\n\n1239\n00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:18,720\nIf that's the case, you can just have it\nwhere you connect to the access point,\n\n1240\n00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,300\nand then use WPA2 to\nencrypt that connection.\n\n1241\n00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,310\nAnd then you put a VPN behind that.\n\n1242\n00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:26,990\nTo VPN to the network from there and that\ngives you two layers of authentication.\n\n1243\n00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:30,040\nYou're authenticating the device\nto the access point, and\n\n1244\n00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,610\nthen you're authenticating\nthe user to the network, you,\n\n1245\n00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:37,410\nvia the UPN, and that give you a whole\nadditional level of protection on it.\n\n1246\n00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:41,570\nSo, you have, you have that, you know,\nyou know, there's another one.\n\n1247\n00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:44,260\nDon't forget physical\naccess to the access point.\n\n1248\n00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:46,720\nPeople tend to think that\nbecause they can do it at home,\n\n1249\n00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,180\nthey can do it on a corporate, or,\nor, or enterprise access point.\n\n1250\n00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,330\nThey think unplugging it and\nplugging it back in will work fine.\n\n1251\n00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:53,395\nDoesn't work that way.\n\n1252\n00:58:53,395 --> 00:58:54,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n1253\n00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,340\nso you, you see those sorts of things.\n\n1254\n00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:00,010\nI'd also say physical\nplacement of the access point.\n\n1255\n00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,420\nNot just physical access, but\nphysical placement's a big deal.\n\n1256\n00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,210\nYou know, putting an access\npoint somewhere on a wall\n\n1257\n00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,920\nsounds like a good idea.\n\n1258\n00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,605\nBut if that wall has the great\noutdoors on the other side of it.\n\n1259\n00:59:10,605 --> 00:59:13,710\n[LAUGH] You just gotta think of that\naccess point, and think of concentric\n\n1260\n00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,870\ncircles coming out from it, and\nrepresenting the coverage area.\n\n1261\n00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:19,430\nYou just pushed half the coverage\narea outside the building.\n\n1262\n00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:22,490\nSo, I mean, someone from the outside,\ncould, could get that.\n\n1263\n00:59:22,490 --> 00:59:25,630\nYou know, so there's there,\nthere's just some things there.\n\n1264\n00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:31,180\nAnd then as far as, you know stuff like,\nbluetooth, bluetooth.\n\n1265\n00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:34,810\nMost of the stuff the tools are,\nare there, bluetooth,\n\n1266\n00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:38,520\nyou should never have\na device that's discoverable.\n\n1267\n00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,845\nYou know, it's discoverable only when\nyou are initially pairing things.\n\n1268\n00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:46,640\nThat's, that's another that's,\nthat's a big one.\n\n1269\n00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,965\nYou know, make making sure people know the\nrisks of, of pairing to unknown devices.\n\n1270\n00:59:50,965 --> 00:59:51,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1271\n00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,440\n>> You know, I'm, I'm big on educating,\nyou know, people on that one.\n\n1272\n00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:57,320\nYou know, and just it,\njust overall, you know,\n\n1273\n00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,740\nbeing smart about what they transfer over,\nwho they transfer it to.\n\n1274\n01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,010\nyou know, when they are using Bluetooth,\nthose are just smart things.\n\n1275\n01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:05,280\nI mean, heck on mine when I,\n\n1276\n01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,850\nI've got Bluetooth in my car at home and\nmy phone is paired to it.\n\n1277\n01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:14,955\nI'm not scared of it but when I'm not near\nmy car, Bluetooth is just not enabled.\n\n1278\n01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:15,605\nIt's turned off.\n\n1279\n01:00:15,605 --> 01:00:16,705\nI don't have any reason for it.\n\n1280\n01:00:16,705 --> 01:00:18,255\nIt's turned off here, you know.\n\n1281\n01:00:18,255 --> 01:00:21,355\nSo, it just,\nit's just something that shouldn't be.\n\n1282\n01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:22,685\n>> Yeah, I noticed that.\n\n1283\n01:00:22,685 --> 01:00:23,875\nWe were trying to find you earlier.\n\n1284\n01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:24,690\n>> Yeah, well, that's why.\n\n1285\n01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:25,425\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just kidding.\n\n1286\n01:00:25,425 --> 01:00:28,305\n[LAUGH] Yeah, cuz we did have a good\nquestion in the chat room about securing,\n\n1287\n01:00:28,305 --> 01:00:30,850\nand it talked about what about\n\n1288\n01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:34,020\nisn't it safe because you have\nto pair it with that device.\n\n1289\n01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,090\nBut in reality that's just a four\ndigit PIN typically, right?\n\n1290\n01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:39,170\nThat we're talking about with pairing.\n\n1291\n01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,662\nWhich means that there's 10,000 I think or\nsomething like that possibilities.\n\n1292\n01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,990\nNot that many, not e,\nnot very difficult to crack.\n\n1293\n01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:49,630\n>> We'll even, we'll even think about it,\nwith, when you're looking at, bluetoo, or\n\n1294\n01:00:49,630 --> 01:00:51,750\npairing bluetooth devices.\n\n1295\n01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:56,140\nYou know, how many, how many devices have\nyou seen that you paired with that, ha,\n\n1296\n01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,370\nused the default pin code and\n\n1297\n01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:58,260\nthey haven't chan-\n>> One, two, three, four.\n\n1298\n01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:00,190\n>> Yeah, Something like that.\n\n1299\n01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:03,210\nThey just, they just,\nthey never change the thing, you know,\n\n1300\n01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:06,330\nthat's just they way it is, that's they\nway it's built in from the factory.\n\n1301\n01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:07,890\nYou can't change it.\n\n1302\n01:01:07,890 --> 01:01:11,240\nThat's the way,\nthat's the way it shall be, and that's it.\n\n1303\n01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,840\nSo I mean yeah, an, you do have\nlittle problems, you know, like that,\n\n1304\n01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:15,590\nthat, that appear.\n\n1305\n01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:18,850\nYou know, I mean,\nI would consider you know,\n\n1306\n01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,450\nI would consider about,\nyou know, getting something.\n\n1307\n01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,370\nI'm not, I'm not saying, you know,\nget a INAUDIBLE], but getting something.\n\n1308\n01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:27,170\nYou know similar to that that\nallows you to scan the area for\n\n1309\n01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,480\nBluetooth devices and find out you know,\nyou know what's out there.\n\n1310\n01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:34,090\nMaybe do an, an again maybe do some\neducation maybe it's a big ti it's,\n\n1311\n01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,305\nit's about time you do\nthose sorts of things.\n\n1312\n01:01:36,305 --> 01:01:37,010\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1313\n01:01:37,010 --> 01:01:39,620\n>> You know, I, I've seen some people\ndo some bone-headed stuff you know with\n\n1314\n01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:42,930\ntheir, with leaving their phones and\ndevices on, they don't think about it.\n\n1315\n01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:47,180\nYou know, so you know, if they,\nyou know, think about those.\n\n1316\n01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:49,890\n>> Something, we go back to our\nvery first episode, the CE Age,\n\n1317\n01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,790\nsecurity versus convenience, it's so\nnice to be able to get into my car and\n\n1318\n01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:56,630\nit picks up right where I left off\non Pandora or something like that,\n\n1319\n01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,780\nbecause I've got my bluetooth enabled\n>> I just sit in and it goes.\n\n1320\n01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:03,140\nIt also means it isn't walking\naround a mall or whatever.\n\n1321\n01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:07,230\nMy Bluetooth is on and anybody can\ndo some of these types of attacks so\n\n1322\n01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,670\nyou've got to weigh the convenience and\nsecurity of it.\n\n1323\n01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:11,000\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1324\n01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,205\nAnd It's, it, you know,\nI look at it with bluetooth, you know,\n\n1325\n01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:15,935\nbluetooth's enabling so\nmany different things.\n\n1326\n01:02:15,935 --> 01:02:18,136\nWe've stuck bluetooth in places\nit just doesn't need to be.\n\n1327\n01:02:18,136 --> 01:02:19,186\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1328\n01:02:19,186 --> 01:02:22,336\n>> Or, if they want to put it there for\na convince reason,\n\n1329\n01:02:22,336 --> 01:02:25,795\nthey need to be more diligent,\nabout, how they secure it.\n\n1330\n01:02:25,795 --> 01:02:29,885\nYou know, if someone actually found out\nhow to, and this isn't a new thing,\n\n1331\n01:02:29,885 --> 01:02:31,850\nthis is an older thing.\n\n1332\n01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:35,520\nHow to reprogram,\ncars in motion using bluetooth.\n\n1333\n01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,430\n>> Right?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1334\n01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:38,670\nThey actually hacked,\nthey actually have video,\n\n1335\n01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,460\nyou can look it up, on it should be on\nYouTube but there's a, you could look up\n\n1336\n01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,340\nvideos of someone reprogramming the\ndashboard while someone's driving the car.\n\n1337\n01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,610\nYou know, so they were, and\n\n1338\n01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:49,980\nthey were sending messages to\nthe person driving the car.\n\n1339\n01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,620\nThere's a couple security\nresearchers that did it as a test.\n\n1340\n01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:58,080\nYou know, so it, it, it's,\nit would, it was just poor design.\n\n1341\n01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,920\nYou want Bluetooth in a car?\n\n1342\n01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,080\nWhy is it on the same,\nyou know, circuit as your,\n\n1343\n01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,327\nas your as the computer is for the car?\n\n1344\n01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:07,800\n>> [LAUGH] Right, so let's,\nlet's segregate that out, please,\n\n1345\n01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:08,540\nauto manufacturers.\n\n1346\n01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> Let's, let's keep us safe.\n\n1347\n01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:12,920\nI don't want my car doing a left hand\nturn going 70 on the interstate, so.\n\n1348\n01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,110\nAll right, well, ladies and gentleman\nanything, well before I do that Shawn,\n\n1349\n01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:21,170\nanything else we wanna add to our,\nour BlueTooth, well, not our BlueTooth.\n\n1350\n01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:24,940\nWe've been talking about so\nmuch BlueTooth, our wireless module?\n\n1351\n01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:27,130\n>> I, well,\nwe've covered quite a bit of ground,\n\n1352\n01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:30,410\nI think we hit it pretty well\n>> You know, we're just waiting for\n\n1353\n01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,700\nany questions anyone had,\nmay have on it later on, but\n\n1354\n01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:37,140\nwe covered it pretty thoroughly I,\nI believe.\n\n1355\n01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:37,800\n>> Good, good, good.\n\n1356\n01:03:37,800 -->

another episode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,783\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:41,943\nHow are you doing, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:43,894\n>> I'm good and ready to get going.\n\n7\n00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:44,986\n>> Ready to rock and roll.\n\n8\n00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:47,482\nWe've got an exciting episode for\nyou guys out there today, guys and gals.\n\n9\n00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:48,143\n>> Whew!\n\n10\n00:00:48,143 --> 00:00:50,690\n[LAUGH]\n>> We are gonna be talking about this is\n\n11\n00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,190\nchapter what,\n16 I believe in your book, I think?\n\n12\n00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,066\n>> Yeah.\n>> And when I say book, I'm referring to\n\n13\n00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:02,000\nthat CEA study guide written by\nnone other than Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n14\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,500\nAnd this chapter is all about evading IDS,\nfirewalls and honey pots.\n\n15\n00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,860\nSo lots of good stuff,\nhope you guys are ready for this.\n\n16\n00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,300\nAnd the first thing we really need\nto talk about Sean I guess is,\n\n17\n00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,080\nwe're talking about evading IDS,\nfirewalls and honey pots,\n\n18\n00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,600\nwe really have to know what an IDS, what\na firewall and what a honey pot is right?\n\n19\n00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,780\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n20\n00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,600\nYou really do have to, gotta have\nan understanding of those devices.\n\n21\n00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,240\n>> And then once you understand\nhow the devices work,\n\n22\n00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,960\nyou kinda start filling in some of\nthe gaps with stuff you already know, and\n\n23\n00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,350\nother things to kinda figure out\nhow you're gonna get around it.\n\n24\n00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,155\nYou know, it's they're pretty easy\nstuff once you de-mystify them a bit.\n\n25\n00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:39,248\n>> Mm-hm.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n26\n00:01:39,248 --> 00:01:39,974\n>> Yeah, and,\n\n27\n00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,954\nand, when we talk about it and IDS,\n\n28\n00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:46,040\nthe acronym simply is just\nIntrusion Detection System, right?\n\n29\n00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,680\n>> Yes.\n\n30\n00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,460\n>> And so, as you can probably\ninfer from the name it's going to\n\n31\n00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,930\ndetect intrusions on our system.\n\n32\n00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,740\nAnd they can either be host based,\n\n33\n00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,320\nmeaning it's monitoring\nan individual host Versions.\n\n34\n00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,940\nOr it could be network based where they\nplug into the network like another node,\n\n35\n00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,650\nand they monitor the entire network for\nintrusion.\n\n36\n00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,130\n>> Yeah, and that's a key point to have or\none of the key points to have when\n\n37\n00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,650\nyou're talking about IDSs,\nis it post based or network based?\n\n38\n00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,170\nYou know, one is responsible for\n\n39\n00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,410\nmonitoring on one side of the network\ncard, and the other is responsible for\n\n40\n00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,710\nmonitoring the other\nside of the network card.\n\n41\n00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:26,400\nAnd the two very quickly loose\nare the ability to help you out once\n\n42\n00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,120\nyou cross over, that host based releasing\nand help you too much on the network side.\n\n43\n00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,440\nNetwork side isn't really gonna\nhelp you too much on the host, so\n\n44\n00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,900\nthey pretty much have their own areas\nwhere they excel in, and their areas where\n\n45\n00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,870\nthey have diminishing effectiveness,\nif any effectiveness at all.\n\n46\n00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,430\n>> Right, and so we'll,\nwe could very well see both, right?\n\n47\n00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,400\n>> We could see one, you know, a company\nthat might run a network based intrusion\n\n48\n00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,420\ndetection system to monitor the network\nas a whole or a particular subnet.\n\n49\n00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,980\nAnd then on that subnet they might have\nvery sensitive hosts that they actually\n\n50\n00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,252\nrun a host space ids on as well\nas another layer of security.\n\n51\n00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:06,040\n>> Yeah and that's really it is that\nyeah you have, you have the two types.\n\n52\n00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,140\nAnd yes they will put host space ids on,\ntypically on those more sensitive assets,\n\n53\n00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,930\nservers, domain controllers\nthings like that.\n\n54\n00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,990\nYou know, it's not common to see them on\neverything because they really don't tend\n\n55\n00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,910\nto scale all that well, but the network\nbased IDS they tend to also kind of\n\n56\n00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,440\nplace them in key areas even though\nthey can't place on the whole network.\n\n57\n00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,830\nThat are a little easier to scale those\nup than they are the host based ones.\n\n58\n00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,710\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n59\n00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,050\nSo when we talk about these\nintrusion detection, and\n\n60\n00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,350\nwe keeping saying detection,\n\n61\n00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,150\nbecause there really are two different\nsystems we can do there too, right?\n\n62\n00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,180\nBesides host based or\n\n63\n00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,360\nnetwork based, we also have to worry about\nwhat type of intrusion system it is.\n\n64\n00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,490\nI'll just say intrusion system,\n\n65\n00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,142\ncause we're gonna change\nthat middle letter, right?\n\n66\n00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:53,690\n>> Yeah, so that's a huge point, glad\nyou're bringing that up because, there's\n\n67\n00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,420\na stumbling point here that people have,\nand it's that whole idea of detection.\n\n68\n00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,550\nWhen talking true detection\nsystem doesn't stop anything,\n\n69\n00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,210\nit notifies people that\nsomething happened.\n\n70\n00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,390\nIt doesn't it doesn't do anything no more,\nthan a smoke detector can stop a fire.\n\n71\n00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,270\nIt's just gonna tell you that that you\nknow something something that is burning,\n\n72\n00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,360\nthat's really it.\n\n73\n00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,950\nYou know, the other one we have is the\nprevention system which goes the next step\n\n74\n00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,690\nwhich will not just\ndetect it a notify you.\n\n75\n00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,530\nIt will also, you know, take actions to\nblock or mitigate that attack somehow.\n\n76\n00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,980\nSo two different categories, so\nmake sure when you hear IDS or IPS.\n\n77\n00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,920\nYou can get the distinction\ncan't be too clear.\n\n78\n00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,970\n>> Yeah.\n>> Because it's kind of one of those terms\n\n79\n00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,970\nthat you change I know over the last\nfew years, because way back when I was\n\n80\n00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,200\nlearning this stuff we called them passive\nor active intrusion detection systems.\n\n81\n00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,850\nSo, your passive intrusion\ndetection would alert you, but\n\n82\n00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,830\nnot do anything to stop the attack.\n\n83\n00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,900\nThe active intrusion detection would\nalert you as well as have the poss,\n\n84\n00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,210\npotential to shut down that network\nsegment or that port on a switch you know,\n\n85\n00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,920\nor something like that to try to\nprevent the attack from propagating.\n\n86\n00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,150\nAnd since they've changed it so\nyou get intrusion detection,\n\n87\n00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,400\nwhich is a passive based intrusion system\nand you've got intrusion prevention.\n\n88\n00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,620\nWhich would be your active system that I,\ncan actually take an action,\n\n89\n00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,830\nperform some kind of action to\npossibly thwart the attack or\n\n90\n00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,520\nprevent it from spreading further or\ndoing more damage.\n\n91\n00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:25,030\n>> Yeah, and that's another good way.\n\n92\n00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,520\nLike these terms aren't\nin major use anymore, but\n\n93\n00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,940\nyes they do accurately\nexplain the actions.\n\n94\n00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,770\nYou know of the two to kind of give\nyou an idea of where they fit.\n\n95\n00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,100\nFit in, so yeah.\n\n96\n00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,892\nGood, good one on that.\n\n97\n00:05:35,892 --> 00:05:40,690\n>> All right, so what do we need to do\nabout these intrusion detection systems if\n\n98\n00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,710\nwe're gonna try to, or should we talk\nabout the detection engines I guess first,\n\n99\n00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,410\nand talk about how they work or?\n\n100\n00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:52,480\n>> Yeah, once we know the different,\nthose different types, the host based and\n\n101\n00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,330\nintrusion based detection systems, we got\nto think about how is it gonna detect.\n\n102\n00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,663\n>> Whatever this is?\n\n103\n00:05:58,663 --> 00:06:00,126\nWell first of all the,\n\n104\n00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:04,217\nwhat we need to remember is that\na intrusion detection system?\n\n105\n00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,484\nAt least on the network side.\n\n106\n00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:07,878\nIs really not much more than a sniffer.\n\n107\n00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:10,173\nIt's just a sniffer that's been\nhopped up on a few things.\n\n108\n00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:10,986\nYou know, we're gonna look at.\n\n109\n00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:12,158\n>> And\nthey charge you a lot more money for it.\n\n110\n00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:12,994\n>> Yeah.\n\n111\n00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:14,001\nIt's price tag.\n\n112\n00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:18,900\nYes [LAUGH] so what you get is you get a,\nwhen you look at a network\n\n113\n00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,930\nbased one it's a sniffer it has they\ncall a rules engine built on top of it.\n\n114\n00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,320\nSo, the traffic comes by it can run\nit through this engine to see if it\n\n115\n00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,490\nmeets any of these predefined rules that\ntell it what to look for and what to do.\n\n116\n00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,960\nYou know, the question is that,\nyou know, just how what's the internal,\n\n117\n00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:41,010\nmechanics of that of that detection\nengine and the rules on top of it.\n\n118\n00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,650\nWe have to have some way\nto put those in place.\n\n119\n00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,280\nAnd that's why they offer, you know,\nthree types they offer a signature based,\n\n120\n00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,660\na behaviour based, and\none that's protocol based.\n\n121\n00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,350\nSo, those are tend to be three main\ntypes that we see for network based.\n\n122\n00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:58,755\nHost based are, have a different\nway which will talk about in a bit.\n\n123\n00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,830\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n124\n00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,740\n>> Okay, so\nlet's start with our signature base.\n\n125\n00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,770\nOur definition base.\n\n126\n00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,580\nI mean that's, sounds a lot like\nmy antivirus software that I run.\n\n127\n00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,990\nOr most of my antivirus software.\n\n128\n00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:12,920\n>> Yeah, it's that's the simplest\nof the bunch really.\n\n129\n00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,070\nYou know it's, it is that.\n\n130\n00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,580\nWhen you a signature database,\nwhen you have signature based ones.\n\n131\n00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,840\nYes, you download a signature and it,\nonce it gets dropped into the IDS\n\n132\n00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,210\nthat's pretty much,\nyou know the end of it.\n\n133\n00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,560\nYou just have to keep that thing updated,\nhowever if you don't keep it updated.\n\n134\n00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,300\nYou'll start getting false negative,\nwhich is really catastrophic,\n\n135\n00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,065\nbecause it means you're missing things.\n\n136\n00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:36,740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Just like you would on a anti-virus,\n\n137\n00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,390\nyou don't keep your anti-virus engine\nup-to-date, it's gonna miss things,\n\n138\n00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:43,610\nand one of things, you know, is gonna,\nis gonna get you eventually.\n\n139\n00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,870\nThat's just the, that's just the you know,\nthe law of averages.\n\n140\n00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,280\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or whatever they call it.\n\n141\n00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,853\n>> Yeah, as they say, you know, just like\nwith anti-virus if I don't keep that up to\n\n142\n00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:55,371\ndate, it's just 'bout as good\nas not running one at all.\n\n143\n00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:59,401\nBecause, things change, things come out so\noften that we gotta keep it up to date,\n\n144\n00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:02,349\nand if you don't you're just\nrunning the risk of an attack.\n\n145\n00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:05,831\nAnd I like that you mentioned that term,\nyou know, with the The false negative.\n\n146\n00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:08,813\nI'm not sure if we talked about that in\nanother episode when we, when we look at\n\n147\n00:08:08,813 --> 00:08:11,745\nthese systems, there's really four\nresponses, right, I can give back?\n\n148\n00:08:11,745 --> 00:08:12,290\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n149\n00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,350\n>> A true positive, a true negative,\na false positive, and a false negative.\n\n150\n00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,610\nA true positive means there is\nan attack and I got an alert.\n\n151\n00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,440\nA, a false positive means there's no\nattack and I didn't get an alert, right?\n\n152\n00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440\nNo wait, I'm sorry.\n\n153\n00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,800\nA, a true positive I have an attack and\nI got alert.\n\n154\n00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,410\nA false positive would mean either,\nthere is no attack but I got an alert.\n\n155\n00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,010\n>> Yes.\n\n156\n00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,140\n>> A false negative means,\nno attack, no alert.\n\n157\n00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,000\nAnd a true negative would be.\n\n158\n00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,820\nThere was an attack, and\nI didn't get an alert.\n\n159\n00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,650\nSo I think I might have done\nthat in a strange order.\n\n160\n00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,345\n>> Close.\n\n161\n00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:45,680\n[LAUGH]\n>> But you get the idea, right?\n\n162\n00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,210\nSo, the, the true positive,\nthe true negative the false positive,\n\n163\n00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:48,750\nthe false negative.\n\n164\n00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,420\n>> I wanna tweak\n>> Yeah.\n\n165\n00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,380\nGo ahead.\n>> Well, let me tweak\n\n166\n00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,201\nthe false negative just a bit.\n\n167\n00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,600\n[LAUGH] Yeah, just to,\njust to, to clear it up.\n\n168\n00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,219\nBut when you get a false negative,\n\n169\n00:08:56,219 --> 00:09:00,270\na false negative means that Something\nhappened you just didn't pick it up.\n\n170\n00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,820\n>> Ok.\n>> Ya so little different.\n\n171\n00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,370\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n172\n00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,270\n>> So you know.\n\n173\n00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,670\n>> A true negative would be nothing\nhappened and I didn't get an alert.\n\n174\n00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,280\n>> Ya.\n\n175\n00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,920\n>> And the reason we're\nconcerned with some of this is,\n\n176\n00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,570\nbecause of some of the other\nengines we can use.\n\n177\n00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,885\nRight?\nActually go through a learning process.\n\n178\n00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:16,290\n>> Oh yeah that's where you\nget the behavioral based ones.\n\n179\n00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,805\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n180\n00:09:16,805 --> 00:09:21,575\nBut behavioral based ones those are ones\nyou can create the rules for yourself or\n\n181\n00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,955\nyou can tune it to your network.\n\n182\n00:09:22,955 --> 00:09:26,415\nThey have a learning mode and most of\nthe modern ones do have a learning mode\n\n183\n00:09:26,415 --> 00:09:31,225\nwhere you let it you know let it sit there\nand just observe for a period of time.\n\n184\n00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:35,210\nMonitor what's going on in your network\nand learn what traffic patterns are in\n\n185\n00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:40,140\nyour specific situation, once it's\nlearned that you can actually flip it\n\n186\n00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:45,190\nto a mode where it will start\nalerting you when it picks up things.\n\n187\n00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:47,730\nYou know, so\nit's actually a pretty cool thing.\n\n188\n00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,080\nThe thing is, is that you do have to have\nit go through that learning mode for\n\n189\n00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,170\nsome period of time.\n\n190\n00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,170\nThe longer it's in that learning mode the\nbetter it's gonna at the, at picking up or\n\n191\n00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,936\nunderstanding what normal\ntraffic patterns look like.\n\n192\n00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:05,350\nBut if they are shorter, it doesn't have\nenough of a sampling, and so it's basing\n\n193\n00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,420\nall the, all your behavior on one small\nsample, so it's gonna be less accurate.\n\n194\n00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:10,980\n>> You right, you right.\n\n195\n00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,440\nSo we, we might go through some,\n\n196\n00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,970\na period of time where we get\nsome of those false positives.\n\n197\n00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,520\nThings like that and\nover time it should get better and better.\n\n198\n00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,380\nAnd that's a good thing, right?\n\n199\n00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,230\nCuz it's learning what's normal on our\nnetwork, not all networks are the same.\n\n200\n00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,460\nAnd some traffic patterns might\nbe acceptable on your network\n\n201\n00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,660\nthat it would normally pick up.\n\n202\n00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,415\nSo, it can start learning those things and\nstop alerting you when they occur.\n\n203\n00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:39,299\nAlright so we got our definition based,\nor I think you called it signature based\n\n204\n00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,205\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Signature based yea.\n\n205\n00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:45,355\n>> So we're downloading signatures\nof malicious activity and\n\n206\n00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:49,530\nit's just looking at the traffic patterns,\nmatching the signature base.\n\n207\n00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,200\nWe've got our, behavior based,\nwhich we just talked about,\n\n208\n00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,580\nyou know, where it's going to look at,\nat, patterns on the network and, and\n\n209\n00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,050\nlook for, signs of, malicious activity.\n\n210\n00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,180\nAnd then the third one was\ngoing to be our, what?\n\n211\n00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,280\n>> Our protocol based.\n\n212\n00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,150\n>> Protocol based.\n\n213\n00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,810\n>> And those ones, the, those ones are\nreally some of the, are, are, getting, ad,\n\n214\n00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,290\nadvanced.\n\n215\n00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,700\nAnd what those ones do is those ones\nactually have rules built or whatever,\n\n216\n00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,270\nhowever you're protocol is supposed to be\nused, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, all those sayings.\n\n217\n00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,880\nIt learns what those sayings, look,\nwhat, what, it, it know what,\n\n218\n00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,860\nhow those protocols\nare supposed to be used.\n\n219\n00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,970\nSo if you try doing any shenanigans\nwith any of those things that don't fit\n\n220\n00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,270\nthe rules, it's gonna flag it.\n\n221\n00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,550\nYou know, for example some of\nthe stuff we do when we go and\n\n222\n00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,600\nhack web applications, some of those\nthings rely on doing things to a,\n\n223\n00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,410\nto the htp protocol and\nused in an unusual ways.\n\n224\n00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,190\nYou know, like there's one\ncall to response splitting,\n\n225\n00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,880\nwhere we actually imbed two headers in,\nin a request instead of one, and\n\n226\n00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,220\nwe cause the system to\nrespond in a funky way.\n\n227\n00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,140\nThat's not really something\nthat should be allowed, and\n\n228\n00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,190\nit's under normal circumstances.\n\n229\n00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,610\nThere really isn't a normal reason\nto do it under normal circumstances.\n\n230\n00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,500\nA protocol-based IDS would\npick that up and say \"yeah,\n\n231\n00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,510\nI don't know why you're doing that.\"\nIt's gonna send an alert to somebody, or\n\n232\n00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,840\nat least put something in a log file.\n\n233\n00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,900\n>> So this could help us look for those\ncovert channels when we're talking about\n\n234\n00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,538\nmis-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n235\n00:12:17,538 --> 00:12:20,960\n>> -using a protocol for\nsomething that it wasn't designed to do.\n\n236\n00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,300\nYeah, that you know,\nthat's absolutely correct,\n\n237\n00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,030\nis that,\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n238\n00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,860\n>> If you try and use a covert channel,\nusing something in a way counter to\n\n239\n00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:32,080\nits design, a behavior base knows\nthe way it's supposed to be used.\n\n240\n00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,970\nIt sees something that's anomalous\nto that It's going to say hey,\n\n241\n00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,810\nthis just doesn't fit normal patterns for\n\n242\n00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,130\nthis so I'm going to alert somebody so\nthey can take a closer look.\n\n243\n00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,800\n>> So the three big engine\ntypes when we deal with these\n\n244\n00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,215\nintrusion detection systems.\n\n245\n00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:52,989\nThere are signature-based,\nthere are protocol-based, and\n\n246\n00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,570\nthen there are behavior-based.\n\n247\n00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,520\nAnd depending on, is there any\npreference of which one you'd use?\n\n248\n00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,350\nDoes it matter?\n\n249\n00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,440\nIs it like a preference,\npreferential thing?\n\n250\n00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,620\nOr certain scenarios one's\nbetter than the other?\n\n251\n00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,430\n>> You know, they all have their benefits,\nre, you know, really their pros and cons.\n\n252\n00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,385\nSome of them actually combine styles.\n\n253\n00:13:10,385 --> 00:13:13,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's, that's not unheard of.\n\n254\n00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,580\nOne of the more popular ones.\n\n255\n00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,185\nI actually see the the chatrooms\nare pretty active on this.\n\n256\n00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:18,700\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n257\n00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,600\n>> You know what's a popular,\nyou know, IDS?\n\n258\n00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,890\nAnd, you know, and free IDS's out there?\n\n259\n00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,070\nSnort's one of the big guys on the block.\n\n260\n00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,810\n>> Snorts a rule based one where you drop\nin your own thing and tune it that way.\n\n261\n00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:35,124\nYou can download definitions for\nit, but you can also you know,\n\n262\n00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:38,820\nput rules in it to make it you know,\ndo what you need to so\n\n263\n00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:44,190\nit will be more like the first and\nsecond category of our IDS'.\n\n264\n00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,250\nAnd it's actually for the, for\nthose of you playing along with this,\n\n265\n00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,490\nyou know, you know,\nat home as I like to say.\n\n266\n00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,030\nIf you're gonna play with an IDS and\nyou wanna, and\n\n267\n00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:57,180\nyou wanna pick the one that's probably\nthe best to learn it's gonna be Snort.\n\n268\n00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,470\n>> Yeah.\n>> And Snort does\n\n269\n00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,060\nactually figure on the exam.\n\n270\n00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,375\nSo, there's an extra you know,\nlayer of benefit there.\n\n271\n00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:06,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And, and, and I said Snort's free.\n\n272\n00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,000\nIt's incredibly well documented.\n\n273\n00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,890\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n274\n00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,070\nyou can, you don't even have to\nbuy any books or anything on that.\n\n275\n00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,980\nYou can go on line and find pretty much\neverything you need to know for that.\n\n276\n00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,630\nPeople have used this thing for years.\n\n277\n00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,020\nIt's actually a corporate\nlevel IDS if you want it.\n\n278\n00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,930\n>> Yeah, I was gonna say, it's not like,\nyou know, it's strange to say,\n\n279\n00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,320\nit's a free product, but\nit is an enterprise level thing.\n\n280\n00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,660\nI have seen, in fact, years ago when I\nflew out to California and took the CEH\n\n281\n00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,510\nfor the first time, people in the building\nwere also taking the snort class, and\n\n282\n00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,880\nthey had a book about, eh,\nsomewhere around like that.\n\n283\n00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,675\n>> That small?\n\n284\n00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:39,430\n[LAUGH]\n>> For\n\n285\n00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,080\nlearning how to right these darn rules and\nthings like that cause it, it can be very\n\n286\n00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,380\ncomplex writing all those rules,\ntrying to fine tune it to what you need.\n\n287\n00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,510\nSo very powerful, but free.\n\n288\n00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,060\nSo go out and\nget you a copy of StoreItAll.\n\n289\n00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,260\nI'll see if I can find a good link for\nit here while we continue on.\n\n290\n00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,260\nSome other ones,\nI know I saw some people mentioning like\n\n291\n00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,680\nUntangle in there\n>> Yeah.\n\n292\n00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,200\n>> That's another one I've heard of,\nwhich is maybe,\n\n293\n00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,860\nI don't know if it's really\ncorporate level, but.\n\n294\n00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,790\n>> Okay.\n>> I don't have any experience with\n\n295\n00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,120\nUntangle, so I'm not sure on that one.\n\n296\n00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:13,360\n>> It's, for you know, for, as, as far\nas I'm concerned, you know, it's not,\n\n297\n00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,360\nnot trying to endorse a product or\nanything, but Snorts probably if you're\n\n298\n00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,795\nnew to it, Snorts probably the best\none to learn because it's so,\n\n299\n00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:19,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n300\n00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,960\n>> So robustly documented.\n\n301\n00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,446\nAnd there's an active community on that\nand it's supported cross-platform too.\n\n302\n00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:30,340\nSo ,you really can't go wrong with that.\n\n303\n00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:36,320\nIf you do go into another IDS\nlater on at your job or whatever,\n\n304\n00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,470\nit's easy enough to move those skills over\nto another IDS once you understand it.\n\n305\n00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:44,580\nI mean, you can still literally install\nSnort on your home network, and\n\n306\n00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,220\nget some and get experience.\n\n307\n00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,400\nYou know, with it.\n\n308\n00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,650\nLike I said very well documented, lot of\ndiscussion groups where people will help\n\n309\n00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:55,361\nyou, you know,\nfigure out how to write rules.\n\n310\n00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:57,355\nYes.\nSo you could learn quite a bit and\n\n311\n00:15:57,355 --> 00:16:02,179\nlike I said you know we really don't dig\ninto Snort in something like this but you\n\n312\n00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:06,656\nmay want to get a little bit of experience\nwith it before you take the exam.\n\n313\n00:16:06,656 --> 00:16:09,507\nI would highly recommend it as\na matter of fact Okay yeah.\n\n314\n00:16:09,507 --> 00:16:12,475\nSo remember what Shawn was saying\nearlier we talk about there's,\n\n315\n00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:16,630\nthere's several different tools that,\nthat fit each one of these categories.\n\n316\n00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,010\nCEH Exam, the EC-Council likes to call out\nlike the, the best of breed one, you know?\n\n317\n00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,120\nAnd so, it doesn't matter which one you're\nusing or playing with or enjoy the most or\n\n318\n00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,140\nanything like that.\n\n319\n00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,471\nBut for the exam, you know,\nwe talked about Nmap.\n\n320\n00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:29,010\n>> Yeah.\n\n321\n00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,140\n>> Wireshark for your sniffer,\nSnort would be the one I would wanna, you,\n\n322\n00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,500\nyou would recommend that they play with-\n>> Very much so, yeah.\n\n323\n00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,850\n>> For taking that CEH Exam.\n\n324\n00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,920\nSo go out, download a copy and\nplay around with Snort.\n\n325\n00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,010\nAll right, so we were talking about\nthe types of ideas that we have.\n\n326\n00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:48,528\nWe've talked about, you know, the, the\nengines that they're using, the underlying\n\n327\n00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:52,460\nfunctionality of these guys, how they're\ngoing about detecting these attacks.\n\n328\n00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,590\nHow do we attack them?\n\n329\n00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,328\nI don't want this intrusion detection\nsystem to set off an alarm when I'm\n\n330\n00:16:58,328 --> 00:17:01,420\nattacking this network, right,\nor I'm doing my Pin Test.\n\n331\n00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,124\n>> Eh, eh, exactly, when you,\nwhen you, when you go after,\n\n332\n00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:07,620\nwhen you have an IDS and all, all of the\nstuff we've done so far, you know, we've,\n\n333\n00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,100\nwe've casually, and both of us have\ncasually mentioned IDS's here or there.\n\n334\n00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,420\nIt's, po, so\nit has poked its head out already.\n\n335\n00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,480\nBut we really haven't talked too much\nabout what does that really mean, and\n\n336\n00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,240\nhow is that gonna impact\nall the stuff we're doing?\n\n337\n00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,310\nWell, it is ga, definitely gonna\nhave an impact on what you're doing,\n\n338\n00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:28,266\nbecause those IDS's are watching, they're\nvery good at what they're looking for,\n\n339\n00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:33,410\nand they're, they're there to to no,\nnot necessarily to stop you,\n\n340\n00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,270\nbut they're to alert the defenders\nthat they're coming.\n\n341\n00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:38,660\nSo, you need to figure out\na way to deal with them.\n\n342\n00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,090\nAnd, when we do, we look at,\n\n343\n00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,760\nwe deal with these things there's\nsome unique techniques that we have.\n\n344\n00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,300\nOne of them is trying to just av,\navoid being detected all together.\n\n345\n00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,120\nThe other one is to impede\nit's ability to detect you.\n\n346\n00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,720\nYou're going to employ\none of those techniques.\n\n347\n00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,947\nAnd the good thing is we kind of already\nhave, you know, those skills in our,\n\n348\n00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:03,306\nin our toolbox, we just haven't, we're\ngonna just have to repurpose them for\n\n349\n00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,605\nthat purpose yet.\n\n350\n00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,535\n>> Oh, that's always great.\n\n351\n00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:08,865\nIf I already know how to do it, I just\ngotta change my technique a little bit?\n\n352\n00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:09,655\nI like it.\n\n353\n00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,175\nI like it.\n\n354\n00:18:10,175 --> 00:18:10,895\n>> Yeah.\n>> But,\n\n355\n00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,025\n>> But yeah, so we, we don't want,\n\n356\n00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:14,935\nif we're doing a Pin Test and\nthe IDS goes off and\n\n357\n00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,755\nsends an alert to everybody,\nwell there's the end of our test, right?\n\n358\n00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:19,215\nThey're like, yep, see,\nour network is foolproof.\n\n359\n00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:20,660\nYou can't even get in.\n\n360\n00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,620\nYeah, we got to get around that thing and,\nand, and figure out if we can\n\n361\n00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,700\ntest the rest of network and stuff\nlike that so tell us how can we do it?\n\n362\n00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,670\nWhat do we, what do we, what are tools\ndo I already have that we can use.\n\n363\n00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,950\nWell, one of the easiest ways to do\nevasion is just not be detected.\n\n364\n00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,898\nNow, I know that sounds like,\nduh, hey didn't I think of that.\n\n365\n00:18:36,898 --> 00:18:38,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> Hey, if you don't want to be seen,\n\n366\n00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780\njust be invisible.\n\n367\n00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,210\n>> We're like, why are we paying you\nto do this again with advice like that,\n\n368\n00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:43,994\nCaptain Obvious?\n\n369\n00:18:43,994 --> 00:18:46,700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's actually ,it's, it's, yeah,\n\n370\n00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,370\nit's evading the attack of being detected.\n\n371\n00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,220\nBut, you know, how do you that?\n\n372\n00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,890\nWell, the way you do that is you make\nyour attack not look like an attack.\n\n373\n00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,550\n>> Right.\n>> And so, the ways,\n\n374\n00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:03,620\nthe ways you could do that is you can for\nexample, recode your attacks in Unicode.\n\n375\n00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,990\nYou can do them in Hex.\n\n376\n00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:08,745\nThings like that will be something that\navoid, that, that gets passed the IDS,\n\n377\n00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,530\ncuz IDS is gonna be looking for\nsomething specific,\n\n378\n00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,220\nand you've changed the fingerprint or\nthe way it looks.\n\n379\n00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,440\n>> So\nit doesn't match that definition anymore?\n\n380\n00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,800\n>> Yeah, ex, exactly.\n\n381\n00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,083\nYeah, if it doesn't match\nthe fingerprint it knows about,\n\n382\n00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:22,670\nthen it's not something that's\ngonna fire off and alert.\n\n383\n00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,800\nYou know, there's that.\n\n384\n00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,130\nThere's also the ability of some of\nthe older IDS's, if you fragment your pat,\n\n385\n00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,660\nyour, your packets as\nthey go past the IDS,\n\n386\n00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,630\nit can evade detection as\nwell because the older IDS's,\n\n387\n00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,965\nwhat they did is older IDS's there\nwasn't a customized device for this.\n\n388\n00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:44,505\nThere wasn't like a box where that's all\nthis did, the older IDS's were literally\n\n389\n00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:48,965\nlike I just said, someone could put a,\nsomeone put a [INAUDIBLE] or\n\n390\n00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:52,675\na sniffer in place like t,\nlike we talked about, tcpdump.\n\n391\n00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,250\n>> Mm-hm\n>> Earlier on in the week they did,\n\n392\n00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,250\nthey put some like that in place and just,\nand interface a rules engine with it.\n\n393\n00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:01,600\nI believe actually that's the way\nSnort got us started with TCPView, and\n\n394\n00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,410\nsomeone said hey, let's open it up and\nstick some stuff on it.\n\n395\n00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,970\nAnd now we have, now have, an IDS.\n\n396\n00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,920\nWell, that's a software based thing, and\nthey didn't have customized hardware for\n\n397\n00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,870\nit, so they stuck it on an old system and\nor, or a system.\n\n398\n00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,661\nAnd if you, if you go back far enough\nwhen they were doing this, cuz Snort has,\n\n399\n00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:24,085\nhas a pretty long, in terms of software,\npretty long you know, you know, and a,\n\n400\n00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,615\nyou know, list of ancestors.\n\n401\n00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:26,230\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n402\n00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,270\n>> And, you know, and\nits and its version history.\n\n403\n00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,720\nThe earlier systems they were putting\n\n404\n00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,380\nit on weren't that fast so-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n405\n00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,100\n>> They, they,\n\n406\n00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,460\nthey were, they were kinda low powered\nsystems, even if that's all they did.\n\n407\n00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,490\nSo what happened is, is that you could\nfragment stuff, send out the IDS, and\n\n408\n00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,630\nthe IDS had a choice.\n\n409\n00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,950\nWe can reassemble those packets, and,\nfor, and, and, and, sen, examine them and\n\n410\n00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,310\nforward them on, or\nI could just let them pass.\n\n411\n00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,330\nAnd you had a choice.\n\n412\n00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,850\nYou actually could tune it to\nsay I want it to reassemble or\n\n413\n00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,450\nI don't want to reassemble.\n\n414\n00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,630\nWell if you're light on horsepower,\nyou don't want\n\n415\n00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,770\nto have reassembled fragmented\npackets because that takes time.\n\n416\n00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,780\nOne or two, you're not gonna notice.\n\n417\n00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,755\nBut you have enough of them go by,\nyou know your performance goes, you know,\n\n418\n00:21:06,755 --> 00:21:08,750\ngoes downhill pretty quickly.\n\n419\n00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,210\nSo on some of these IDS's, and\nsome of them you can do this even now,\n\n420\n00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:16,230\nyou can fragment a you can fragment\na packet and get it across.\n\n421\n00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,600\nBecause they they may not be\nable to keep up with it, or\n\n422\n00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,200\nsomeone may have set it up so\nit doesn't reassemble these fragments.\n\n423\n00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,740\nNowadays don't expect it.\n\n424\n00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,180\nThe modern, you know, the modern systems,\nyou know, are, the, even if they're,\n\n425\n00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,990\neven if it's something put on\na computer that's been customized for\n\n426\n00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,635\nthat, they are much faster.\n\n427\n00:21:32,635 --> 00:21:36,830\nThey are much more likely to need to,\nit can reassemble and keep up with you.\n\n428\n00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:40,610\nAnd if you have hardware devices that it's\nproprietary and that's what it does, it's,\n\n429\n00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,710\nit's, it's gonna be even,\n\n430\n00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,450\nyou know, less likely that they're\ngonna be able to be evaded that way.\n\n431\n00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n432\n00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,990\nSo we can try to disguise our attack and,\nand\n\n433\n00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,960\nmake it to where it doesn't\nlook like an attack.\n\n434\n00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,430\nBy trying to not match\nthat definition anymore.\n\n435\n00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:59,650\nModify the code in a way that it\ndoesn't match the definition exactly,\n\n436\n00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,040\nor fragment it up,\nbreak it into pieces and\n\n437\n00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,020\nmaybe the other end isn't putting\nall those pieces back together and\n\n438\n00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,890\nlooking at the whole, so\nit doesn't recognize it as an attack.\n\n439\n00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,140\nIt just sees a piece here, a piece there,\na piece here, and everything looks good,\n\n440\n00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,340\nlike dissembling a weapon and,\nyou know, and spreading the parts out,\n\n441\n00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,120\nyou know, recognize it as,\nas a weapon at that point.\n\n442\n00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,340\n>> Yeah.\n>> A, that, that, that's absolutely right.\n\n443\n00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,578\n>> You know, that's how I got\nthat weapon through my luggage.\n\n444\n00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:24,083\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, No.\n\n445\n00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:26,969\n[LAUGH] >> I thought I saw a bulge\nin the back on you there, John.\n\n446\n00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:28,320\nBut that one's going to have-\n\n447\n00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,490\n>> If the TSA is watching, just kidding.\n\n448\n00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,928\nGet strip searched next time I'm there.\n\n449\n00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:33,848\n>> Yeah.\n>> Another\n\n450\n00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:36,855\nthing we've talked about in our,\nour scanning module,\n\n451\n00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:40,574\nwe talked about how we could\nslow some of those scans down.\n\n452\n00:22:40,574 --> 00:22:41,435\n>> Yes.\n>> You know,\n\n453\n00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:44,406\nbecause if we just let it run, it's going\nto hit, depending on what ports we're\n\n454\n00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,310\nscanning, but it's going to go through\nthem, [SOUND] you know, right there.\n\n455\n00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,332\nAnd that's something we said, in that\nepisode could definitely trigger off some\n\n456\n00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:53,610\nkind of intrusion detection system.\n\n457\n00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,940\nSo then, the inverse is true, right?\n\n458\n00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,690\nIf we slow it down, we could maybe\navoid that detection system.\n\n459\n00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,820\n>> Yes that's,\nthat's absolutely that's absolutely right.\n\n460\n00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,710\nWhat's gonna happen is if we,\nif we do spread things out and\n\n461\n00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,460\nthrottle down our attacks\ninstead of just being, you know,\n\n462\n00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,300\ngoing at it hard and heavy and, and\ntaking a chance that's gonna pick us up,\n\n463\n00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,450\nwe decrease the density\nof that attack over time.\n\n464\n00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,520\nSo what happens is is like it's just\nlike a little blip on the radar here or\n\n465\n00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,910\nhere or here.\n\n466\n00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,294\nAnd since it's spread out,\ndoesn't really set up any red flags.\n\n467\n00:23:25,294 --> 00:23:29,520\nWhereas if you had, you know, 100 hits\ntaking place in a very short period of\n\n468\n00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,920\ntime, that's a big target\nthat it's gonna pick up.\n\n469\n00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,590\nIt's gonna see this thing\ncoming down the wire.\n\n470\n00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:36,090\nAnd it's gonna flag a bunch of\nthem in a short period of time,\n\n471\n00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,940\nand it's gonna say yes,\nwe've got, we've got a problem.\n\n472\n00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,690\n>> Yeah so if, if you hit one port\nat a time every couple of minutes or\n\n473\n00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,220\nso it might not see it as an attack.\n\n474\n00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:51,260\n>> If you hit all 65,000 ports\nin a matter of three minutes,\n\n475\n00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,310\nit's gonna see that as an obvious port\nscan and think something's wrong.\n\n476\n00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:57,100\nBut, but it expects connections\nto ports now and again.\n\n477\n00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,708\nSo once in a while here or\nthere it, it doesn't bother or\n\n478\n00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,717\ndoesn't, hopefully it doesn't set it off.\n\n479\n00:24:01,717 --> 00:24:04,660\nAnd this would be I'm assuming\none of those behavior-based type\n\n480\n00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,100\nintrusion detection systems\nthat would pick this attack up.\n\n481\n00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,685\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nMore than likely that's what\n\n482\n00:24:08,685 --> 00:24:09,565\nit's gonna be.\n\n483\n00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:13,054\nThe other ones do have a possibility to do\nit, but more likely, it's gonna be that\n\n484\n00:24:13,054 --> 00:24:16,160\nand that, that second category we\ntalked about, that behavior based.\n\n485\n00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,300\nYou know so, it's not gonna see it as\nnormal behavior on that network so\n\n486\n00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,770\nit's gonna, it's gonna flag somebody and\nsay that yeah,\n\n487\n00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,420\nthis is something you may\nwanna take a closer look at.\n\n488\n00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:29,530\nBut yeah, it's, it goes back to the stuff\nwe've said all during you know, this,\n\n489\n00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,650\nthis course.\n\n490\n00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,540\nYou got to be patient.\n\n491\n00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,240\nYou can't just go through and say I want\nit now, you know, and, and just, and\n\n492\n00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,480\njust go for it.\n\n493\n00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,750\nYeah, you have to, you have to,\nyou kind of start really slow,\n\n494\n00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,620\nand then slowly ratchet up when\nyou're doing stuff like this,\n\n495\n00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,740\nto where you're close to setting things\noff, but you're not setting things off.\n\n496\n00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,660\nYou can't just go and say, I'm gonna start\nas fast as possible and ratchet it back.\n\n497\n00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,620\nYou're done, you fried yourself on\nthe first go around, you can't do that.\n\n498\n00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,270\n>> You've already set the alarms off,\nyou might as well not slow down now,\n\n499\n00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,710\njust get everything again and run.\n\n500\n00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,430\n>> Ye, yeah, your, your,\nyour, your, your done.\n\n501\n00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:09,422\nYou better do a smash and grab and\nget the heck out of dodge, so yeah.\n\n502\n00:25:09,422 --> 00:25:12,930\n>> All right so\nwe could either try to disguise our attack\n\n503\n00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,910\n>> Maybe it won't fit those definitions or\n\n504\n00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:20,200\nmatch the behaviors or,\nof known malicious activity.\n\n505\n00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,580\nWe could try to alter our attack in a way,\nwhere it doesn't no longer eh,\n\n506\n00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,350\nwhen it no longer matches\nthose behavior patterns.\n\n507\n00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,400\nSlow it down a little bit, for example.\n\n508\n00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,561\nAnything we can do against\nthe idea systems, themselves?\n\n509\n00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:35,390\n>> Yes.\n>> Instead of trying to avoid it,\n\n510\n00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,832\nwhy don't we just take it our.\n\n511\n00:25:36,832 --> 00:25:40,920\n>> Yeah, that's something that we've\nalready, that we've already seen.\n\n512\n00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:45,360\nWe just reapply that attack to this case.\n\n513\n00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,280\nIt's doing, it's doing what amounts to\na denial of service, against an IDs.\n\n514\n00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:54,050\nIf I, if I can pound on that IDS enough\nto where it's being overwhelmed some\n\n515\n00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,350\ninteresting things are gonna happen.\n\n516\n00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,890\nEither it's gonna out and out fail, or\nit get's to a point where it's trying\n\n517\n00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:03,680\nto keep up with traffic but it can't,\nit's like drinking out of a fire hose.\n\n518\n00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:08,210\nSo, it's, it's getting so much going\nby that it's only checking every so,\n\n519\n00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,740\nyou know, every so many packets or so, so\n\n520\n00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,840\nyou could hide your attack in\nthe noise as it's going by.\n\n521\n00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,670\n>> Hm.\n\n522\n00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,770\n>> But you do have to remember,\n\n523\n00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,200\nif you do something like that,\nentirely possible to do it.\n\n524\n00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,330\nIt isn't a, it is effective.\n\n525\n00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,920\nBut you're also setting\na lot of alerts to.\n\n526\n00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,600\nI mean by very nature you're betting\nup the ids it's gonna its gonna know.\n\n527\n00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,560\n>> So I almost might need a one of our,\n\n528\n00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,130\nwell something else we've already talked\nabout I might need a of some kind.\n\n529\n00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,800\nThat I can use to put dummy attacks on,\n\n530\n00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,720\nbecause I definitely don't want to do the,\nthe bulk of the attacks from the system\n\n531\n00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,300\niMac is they can trace it back to me,\nright?\n\n532\n00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,510\nSo if I had dummy, you,\nyou know, bot nets attacking,\n\n533\n00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,770\nsetting up all kinds of loads\nuntil that thing couldn't keep up.\n\n534\n00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,915\nMaybe I could slip in underneath\nthe radar, and, and do it like that.\n\n535\n00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:51,700\n>> Yeah,and, you know, and\n\n536\n00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,520\nthere's another way to look at this to\nfrom the social aspect of it, you know?\n\n537\n00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,320\nWe put, you know, I'm pretty sure,\nI'm pretty sure most of the,\n\n538\n00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,350\nmost if not all of us\nhave heard the whole,\n\n539\n00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:03,538\nyou know Story of Chicken Little,\nyou know, the sky is falling.\n\n540\n00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I,\n\n541\n00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,400\nI, admin's are gonna be the same way.\n\n542\n00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,290\n>> Hm.\n>> They're gonna be the exact same way.\n\n543\n00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:11,340\nIf I ca, I don't necessarily\nhave to do my TAC right away.\n\n544\n00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,110\nI'll just beat up on the IDS a few ti,\na few times.\n\n545\n00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:17,305\nNot do any Any other attack\nexcept beat up that IDS.\n\n546\n00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:21,245\nAnd I'll get it to fire off enough\nalerts that, that guy that's monitoring\n\n547\n00:27:21,245 --> 00:27:24,865\nlog files or has his, you know,\ncell phone on is getting text messages and\n\n548\n00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:27,392\nall is going, to hell with it,\nI gotta tune that IDS.\n\n549\n00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:29,282\nAnd he might either turn it off.\n\n550\n00:27:29,282 --> 00:27:30,672\nOr in some cases, I've seen him get so\n\n551\n00:27:30,672 --> 00:27:34,112\nmany alerts over a period of time\nthat they create a custom mailbox.\n\n552\n00:27:34,112 --> 00:27:34,789\nOr-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,326\n>> Open a separate mailbox for the IDS.\n\n554\n00:27:36,326 --> 00:27:38,499\nAnd they just delete the stuff\na couple times a day.\n\n555\n00:27:38,499 --> 00:27:39,986\nIt's like, I can't deal with this.\n\n556\n00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:43,138\nThis, I'm getting rid of it,\n[LAUGH] I win, at that point.\n\n557\n00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:43,867\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n558\n00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:47,726\n>> You know, If I tick you off, and\nyou're not looking at it, I win.\n\n559\n00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:49,726\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> You create a custom mailbox and\n\n560\n00:27:49,726 --> 00:27:53,206\nit's not, and you're not seeing it,\nexcept checking it a few times a day.\n\n561\n00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:57,196\nAnd even, and if you're,\nand emptied it out, I win.\n\n562\n00:27:57,196 --> 00:28:01,760\nMy attack unimpeded, at least past that\nIDS, because their gonna ignore it.\n\n563\n00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,110\nAnd, you know,\nthat does absolutely happen.\n\n564\n00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,238\n>> All right. I can see that. [LAUGH]\n>> Every one of you knows you have stuff\n\n565\n00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:08,772\nin your life that, you know,\nwhether it's kids going call,\n\n566\n00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,055\ncalling you all the time and\nasking you for something.\n\n567\n00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:12,970\n[LAUGH] Or\nelse it's to complain about something.\n\n568\n00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,040\nI don't wanna hear it anymore.\n\n569\n00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,550\nBoss asked for something or other.\n\n570\n00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,440\nIt's human nature.\n\n571\n00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,710\nIt's that social engineering aspect.\n\n572\n00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,430\nWhat's the person on the other side doing?\n\n573\n00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,040\n>> Yeah, you know, we've got\nthe running joke around here whoever,\n\n574\n00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,650\nwe've got our big bizhub printer or\nwhatever, and it needs an email address to\n\n575\n00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,450\nsend issues it's having to and whoever\ngoes and fixes the printer that day we'll\n\n576\n00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,060\nalways pick one of the other\nguys to put their email address.\n\n577\n00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,100\nSo we'll change the address and\nall of a sudden you're getting you know,\n\n578\n00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,720\n25 to 30 email addresses from the printer,\nand I create that junk mail.\n\n579\n00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,150\nI just create a rule that says anything\nfrom Canon IR, just send it over here.\n\n580\n00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:46,450\nBut I can so see an admin doing that.\n\n581\n00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,790\nYou know, knowing okay on Monday I\ngot a whole bunch of alerts,\n\n582\n00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,380\non Tuesday got a bunch of alerts.\n\n583\n00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,820\nI really need to get around and\nsee what's going on in that IDS,\n\n584\n00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,380\nbecause there's no attack.\n\n585\n00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,780\nI'm getting these scam alerts, maybe I\njust need to adjust it a little bit.\n\n586\n00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,460\nBut I don't have time, and so I'll just go\nahead and put all this stuff in a separate\n\n587\n00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,310\nfolder in my inbox and not pay\nattention to it, until I have time.\n\n588\n00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,490\nAnd, and that's it, you're home free.\n\n589\n00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,845\nYou just got the guard to go take a nap\nbasically or you paid the guard to go for.\n\n590\n00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:11,655\nGo for a walk.\n\n591\n00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:12,895\n>> Yeah.\n>> While you do whatever\n\n592\n00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,155\nit is you got to do.\n\n593\n00:29:14,155 --> 00:29:15,305\nI like that, I like that.\n\n594\n00:29:15,305 --> 00:29:18,765\n>> It's just like having a guard dog, you\nknow, someone puts a guard dog out there\n\n595\n00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:20,705\nand I irritate it enough,\nwhere it's barking all the time.\n\n596\n00:29:20,705 --> 00:29:23,255\nEventually that person who's suppose to\nbe checking why that dog's barking all\n\n597\n00:29:23,255 --> 00:29:24,550\nthe time is gonna open the door.\n\n598\n00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,254\nShut the hell up and slam the door on it.\n\n599\n00:29:26,254 --> 00:29:27,192\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n600\n00:29:27,192 --> 00:29:27,735\n>> I win.\nYeah.\n\n601\n00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:29,870\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know, it's like car alarms today.\n\n602\n00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,280\nI mean, they're kind of the same thing.\n\n603\n00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,200\nHow many of you, I'm so desensitized,\nI hear somebody's car alarm go off.\n\n604\n00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,480\n>> That's another good example, yeah.\n\n605\n00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,930\n>> I don't go look, I don't go see if my\nneighbor's getting his car, you know,\n\n606\n00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,880\nbroken into or anything like that.\n\n607\n00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,590\nAll I worry about, wait, is that my horn?\n\n608\n00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,770\nNope.\nOkay, I'm good.\n\n609\n00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,520\nYeah, so yeah.\nVery true.\n\n610\n00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,350\nVery true.\nAll right.\n\n611\n00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,450\nWell, we've got a good, a lot of\ngood information there about IDSs.\n\n612\n00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,010\nAnything else we wanna\nthrow in about those guys?\n\n613\n00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:55,410\n>> Yeah, we could probably just\nquickly squeeze it in here on,\n\n614\n00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,760\non the Host space side.\n\n615\n00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,310\n>> Oh, sure.\n\n616\n00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,020\n>> The Host Space,\nthat's the other type of IDS,\n\n617\n00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,340\njust to kind of wrap the whole thing up.\n\n618\n00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,080\nhost based IDS's are design like,\n\n619\n00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,240\nlike was said they just monitor what's\ngoing on in an individual system.\n\n620\n00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,570\nWhat they can do,\nis they can monitor misuse of that system.\n\n621\n00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,530\nThey can monitor changes in files.\n\n622\n00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,400\nThey do that through hashing by the way,\nsomething that we talked about way back.\n\n623\n00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,930\nThey can hash critical system files,\nand if they're altered,\n\n624\n00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,925\nthey can check like the root kits or\nsomething.\n\n625\n00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:22,470\n>> Hm-hm.\n>> They can compare the hashes\n\n626\n00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:25,180\nto see if they see how\nwell this file's changed.\n\n627\n00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:27,020\nIt's not the hash they have on file.\n\n628\n00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,540\nSo, if there's a difference here,\nyou'd find out.\n\n629\n00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,554\nSo that's that, that's,\nthat's one, that's one it can do.\n\n630\n00:30:32,554 --> 00:30:35,421\nThe misuse, privilege of misuse on\na system, it can pick up, reboots and\n\n631\n00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:36,130\nstuff like that.\n\n632\n00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,260\nPick up and say,\nhey this shouldn't be happening.\n\n633\n00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,900\nOr this is too many in\na short period of time.\n\n634\n00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,870\nAnd then theres one's that look at\neven LOG files, that will look for\n\n635\n00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,590\nanomalous behavior in a LOG file.\n\n636\n00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:48,010\nAnd it will alert you about that too so.\n\n637\n00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,960\n>> Cuz nobody's trying to cover their\ntracks and clear LOG entries or\n\n638\n00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:51,810\nsomething like that?\n\n639\n00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,300\n>> Yeah or, or and event pops up.\n\n640\n00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,880\nI mean, if you get a bunch of log ins that\nare that are attempted log ins that fail,\n\n641\n00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,720\nit could very well say I'm just\ngonna lock up that account.\n\n642\n00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,490\nAnd I'm gonna, automatically I'm\ngonna lock up that account and\n\n643\n00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,000\ntell somebody that, hey,\nthere's an alert on this.\n\n644\n00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,470\nAnd it won't unlock it\nuntil someone until,\n\n645\n00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,230\nuntil someone checks to\nsee what the behavior is.\n\n646\n00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,050\nSo one of the oldest I,\nhost base IDS's which were the first\n\n647\n00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,360\ntype of IDS's out there is one called\ntripwire, which is still out there, and\n\n648\n00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,640\nit started as a, as a file verification\nsystem with a hashing type deal.\n\n649\n00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,840\nAnd they've added other stuff\non to it through the years.\n\n650\n00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,010\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n651\n00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,640\nBut I think the, the big key part to\nremember about these host base is\n\n652\n00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,600\nthey're only going to protect that\none host that it's running on so\n\n653\n00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,410\nif there's an attack going on against the\nmachine right next to them on the subnet,\n\n654\n00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,690\nit's not gonna do you any good.\n\n655\n00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,000\nIt's only protecting that one machine.\n\n656\n00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,330\nSo as you said, I think earlier\nat the beginning of this episode,\n\n657\n00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,470\nit's on the inside of that\nnetwork adaptor, right.\n\n658\n00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> On the machine side of that\n\n659\n00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,700\nnetwork adaptor.\n\n660\n00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:51,510\nAnything going on the other side of the\nnetwork adaptor, it doesn't care about.\n\n661\n00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,240\nSo that's when we'll see\na combination of host-based and\n\n662\n00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,060\nthen network-based,\nto catch those attacks on the network.\n\n663\n00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,630\n>> Okay. Work. >> And that's a key\nexam thing, by the way, people.\n\n664\n00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,779\nIs that, is, I you know,\nI've been using that for\n\n665\n00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:06,166\nyears where it's like just\nvisualize a network card.\n\n666\n00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:09,145\nIf you are being, if you are being\ntasked in any way, shape or\n\n667\n00:32:09,145 --> 00:32:12,827\nform to ask what type of IDS you're\ngonna get,- And the host is over here,\n\n668\n00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:16,393\nnetwork is over here you're like okay,\nwhat is it network based ideas,\n\n669\n00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:20,251\nhost based ideas don't, don't look at\neither one of those ask yourself where\n\n670\n00:32:20,251 --> 00:32:23,525\nis the activity you're trying to\nmonitor taking place is over this\n\n671\n00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,660\nside of the network card or\nthat side of the network card.\n\n672\n00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,970\nOnce you know what area it's in,\n\n673\n00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:30,240\nit's a simple matter to say it's\nnetwork based or host based.\n\n674\n00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,250\nSo, pay attention to that and\nthat will get you through.\n\n675\n00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:33,750\n>> Nice.\n\n676\n00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,600\nNice.\nAlright,\n\n677\n00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,880\nwell, does that cover IDSs for us?\n\n678\n00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,600\n>> I think we're good.\n\n679\n00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,510\nI think we got it.\n\n680\n00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,000\n>> All right.\nTell you what, guys and gals,\n\n681\n00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,500\nlooking at our clock,\nit's about time for us to take a break.\n\n682\n00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,340\nWe still have our firewalls coming up.\n\n683\n00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,690\nSo stay tuned.\n\n684\n00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,852\nWe'll be right back.\n\n685\n00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:54,808\n[MUSIC]\n\n686\n00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:56,990\nAll right, welcome back ladies and\ngentlemen.\n\n687\n00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,580\nContinuing on with our\nevading IDS episode,\n\n688\n00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,010\ngetting ready to dive into\nthe world of firewalls.\n\n689\n00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,990\nSo we're gonna do some fire diving.\n\n690\n00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,140\nClose enough.\n\n691\n00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,730\n>> Yeah we could coin,\nwe could coin that term.\n\n692\n00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:10,600\nI mean we got.\n\n693\n00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,360\n>> That's a term now.\n\n694\n00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,420\n>> Yeah right.\n>> And we'll sue you guys if you use it.\n\n695\n00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,005\nWe got fire walking, why not fire diving.\n\n696\n00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:17,110\n[LAUGH]\n>> So, so\n\n697\n00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:21,320\nfirewalls are going to try to prevent us,\nright?\n\n698\n00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,570\nWe've talked about firewalls in,\nin several classes besides this one,\n\n699\n00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,640\nand we've talked about firewalls in\nthis particular they're in CEH as well.\n\n700\n00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,860\nSo at this point we really should be\nfamiliar with, with what a firewall does.\n\n701\n00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,890\nWe do want to talk about I guess about\nsome of the different types of firewalls\n\n702\n00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,820\nthat we might run into\nbecause that's gonna change\n\n703\n00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,250\nthe way we try to maybe evade that\nfirewall or get through that firewall.\n\n704\n00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:45,318\nYes.\nEach one has it's own little was of\n\n705\n00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:48,490\nworking and each one of those\nthings determines, you know what,\n\n706\n00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,890\njust you know what you can\nget away with and when,\n\n707\n00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,380\nwhat's it's capable,\nwhat's its capable of doing to stop you.\n\n708\n00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,270\nYou know so\nwe have different generations and\n\n709\n00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,370\nwe can really talk about three of\nthe different way, generations or\n\n710\n00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,940\ntypes of firewalls to give you\nan idea of what you can expect to see.\n\n711\n00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,799\nYou know, so\nsome pretty kind of interesting stuff.\n\n712\n00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,650\nWhat we have is, you know, we have we\nhave the, the first generation ones,\n\n713\n00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:13,575\nwhich are packet genera,\npacket filtering firewalls.\n\n714\n00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:14,170\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n715\n00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,060\n>> Those just do,\nthose just you know, filter traffic,\n\n716\n00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,730\nyou know you know down at that low level.\n\n717\n00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,250\n>> Right.\n>> Look for sor for\n\n718\n00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:24,400\nsource address, destination address,\nport, and protocol.\n\n719\n00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,460\nThat's it.\n\n720\n00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,840\nDoesn't do any,\ndoesn't do any deep hack at anything.\n\n721\n00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,150\nIt's if it checks those things, if they're\nokay then boom, it's gonna, it's gonna,\n\n722\n00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,700\nit's gonna pass I mean if the rules\nare there to say it's allowed to pass.\n\n723\n00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,520\nYou know.\n\n724\n00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,610\n>> Pretty simplistic here.\n\n725\n00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:41,000\nIt really doesn't pay attention to say,\nthe conversation or\n\n726\n00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,675\nwhat's inside the packets.\n\n727\n00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,584\nIt's look in to that header information.\n\n728\n00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:48,153\nAs you said you can create rules\nbased on source destination or\n\n729\n00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,550\nprotocol which is your port number.\n\n730\n00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,520\nto decide whether it's going\nto drop that packet or not.\n\n731\n00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,660\nSo it doesn't.\n\n732\n00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,980\nIt doesn't get any deeper then and\nthat's really what we started with, and\n\n733\n00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,290\nthe problem was those would\nhave some vulnerabilities and\n\n734\n00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:03,860\nsome weaknesses because\nof the way they did that.\n\n735\n00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,703\n>> Yeah, it's you, you could look at\nit as a weakness or just a limit,\n\n736\n00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:11,950\na overall limitation, it was, it did,\nit just did those few things and.\n\n737\n00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,030\nIt, those things that did quite well.\n\n738\n00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,140\nYou know, and that's the reason why they\nactually still seeing them in use because\n\n739\n00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,350\nthey, they still do work quite well within\nthe element, but once you start pushing it\n\n740\n00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,990\nbeyond that, it's, it's not going to,\nit's not going to help you too much.\n\n741\n00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:30,970\nYou know, things like using a covert,\nlike using a covert channel with ICMP,\n\n742\n00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,900\nthat, that, the packet level ones\naren't gonna actually be able\n\n743\n00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:40,110\nto stop that because, i, it,\nit's not looking inside anything.\n\n744\n00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,990\n>> Yes.\n>> It's just looking at the outside.\n\n745\n00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,870\n>> Exactly, if you've got a rule\nthat says, hey, you know, ICMP,\n\n746\n00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,790\nEcho Request or type a are allowed, it\ndoesn't matter what's inside that payload,\n\n747\n00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,520\ncause remember ping packets can't have\na payload, it's gonna allow it right\n\n748\n00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,960\nthrough, because the rule says, hey,\nI, ICMP echo requests are allowed.\n\n749\n00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,020\nOr if you're doing something across,\nyou know, any of the other protocols.\n\n750\n00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,780\nIt's the same thing.\n\n751\n00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,140\nAll it's looking at is that port number.\n\n752\n00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,160\nSo, it doesn't really dive\nany deeper than that.\n\n753\n00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,141\n>> Yeah.\nWasn't designed to do it, so\n\n754\n00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:09,790\nit's not gonna do it.\n\n755\n00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,200\n>> All right, so that's one type.\n\n756\n00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,330\nBut then we, as the technology improved,\n\n757\n00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,860\nas our processing power that we could\nput into these devices improved,\n\n758\n00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,280\ncuz that was another kind of a something\nthat held us back a little bit.\n\n759\n00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,990\nIt did take a lot to look at every\nsingle packet that comes in.\n\n760\n00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,824\nAnd we're not even diving\ninside the packet.\n\n761\n00:36:23,824 --> 00:36:24,718\n>> Yeah.\n>> I keep saying diving.\n\n762\n00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:25,472\nI think I've got the.\n\n763\n00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,983\n>> Oh.\n\n764\n00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:26,808\n>> It's summer time.\n\n765\n00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:30,441\nWe're, we're ready to start swimming\naround Florida, but anyway.\n\n766\n00:36:30,441 --> 00:36:31,742\n>> Put Scott on the sue list.\n\n767\n00:36:31,742 --> 00:36:33,262\nWe got, we got one.\n\n768\n00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:33,959\n>> Fire diving.\n\n769\n00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,201\nThere we go.\nYeah.\n\n770\n00:36:35,201 --> 00:36:37,267\nIf you guys get that\none wrong on the exam,\n\n771\n00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:40,590\nyou guys can shoot me you can\ncurse me in an email or something.\n\n772\n00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,198\n[LAUGH] But yea, so we started out\nwith those simple firewalls but\n\n773\n00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:46,529\nagain as technology got better, as we knew\nbetter way, figured out better ways to\n\n774\n00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:50,078\nprevent some of these attacks and\nthings like that, the firewalls evolved.\n\n775\n00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:53,370\nAnd we have a second type of firewall\nthat we could throw out there.\n\n776\n00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,410\n>> Yeah, another, another good type\nis the application level ones that\n\n777\n00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,340\nthose ones are, are your proxy's and stuff\nlike that, they can do content filtering.\n\n778\n00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,940\nAnd their living further up the OSI model,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n779\n00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,880\nSo, you can, you can tell it\nwhat kind of contents allowed,\n\n780\n00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,400\nwhat type of contents not allowed and\nthey can do filtering there.\n\n781\n00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,340\nSo, you're talking some pretty advance\nstuff and they actually are very popular\n\n782\n00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,080\nwith corporations because, you know,\nit can block questionable content.\n\n783\n00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,150\nThey can block illegal content.\n\n784\n00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:21,590\nThey can just block things\nthat they just don't want.\n\n785\n00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:26,250\nYeah I see these all the times,\nin, in schools, in libraries, and\n\n786\n00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,850\nas you said in corporate environments.\n\n787\n00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,970\nAnywhere I really wanna control\nwhat they're doing, to,\n\n788\n00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,870\nbecause it can actually look at\nthat traffic that's going out or\n\n789\n00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,850\ncoming back in, and if it sees a,\nlike a word, you can have lists of, like,\n\n790\n00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:43,260\nwords that are flagged as bad or\neven just URLs as bad.\n\n791\n00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,550\nAnd it can drop those particular packets.\n\n792\n00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,330\nSo anytime you need to, to control what\nthey're allowed to do, when they go out,\n\n793\n00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,180\nor control what content they're actually\nviewing, those application levels,\n\n794\n00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,390\nthose proxies are very handy.\n\n795\n00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,250\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n796\n00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,580\n>> Yeah but we will have to, you know,\n\n797\n00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,670\none of the things when you think about\nthose guys is you're running a proxy like\n\n798\n00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:06,230\nthat that means all traffic is\nactually flowing through that right?\n\n799\n00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,110\n>> It's a choke point.\n\n800\n00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,120\n>> Yes.\nIt does become a choke point or\n\n801\n00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,800\na single point of failure depending on how\nthe network is structured out you might\n\n802\n00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,990\nhave more than one that\nyou balance through.\n\n803\n00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,540\n>> But in order for\nit to be effective, I mean,\n\n804\n00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:19,780\nall that traffic has to come through\nthere, otherwise I don't get to\n\n805\n00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,860\nlook at the traffic and\nthen block certain types of traffic.\n\n806\n00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,720\n>> Yep.\n\n807\n00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,520\n>> So, you know,\nsomething to think about there.\n\n808\n00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,400\nAnd then we've got our, our third\ntype of firewall that we have to deal\n\n809\n00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,260\nwith,\n>> Yeah.\n\n810\n00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,810\nOur, out third big one's kind of a,\na, kind of an interesting one.\n\n811\n00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:34,470\nIt's a stateful, you know, firewalls.\n\n812\n00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:38,390\nThese are ones that did, you know, kinda,\nyou know, pop their head out, you know,\n\n813\n00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,610\nearlier on in the class when we were\ntalking, in this course, talking about you\n\n814\n00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:47,720\nknow, different types of scans and stuff\nlike that because these can see where,\n\n815\n00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,420\nyou know where, what I like to call\nconversation is between a couple hosts.\n\n816\n00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,860\nIt can look at that and\ndetermine, you know,\n\n817\n00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,890\nif that part of the conversation\nshould happening at the right time.\n\n818\n00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,710\nIt can block it if it's\ncoming in at the wrong times.\n\n819\n00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,890\nSo, there's some,\nthere's some cool stuff going on there.\n\n820\n00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,020\nFor us, one of the scans that we saw that\ncomes into play here and shows us just\n\n821\n00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,590\nwhat a stateful firewall's gonna do was\ngoing back to an ACK scan with with Nmap.\n\n822\n00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,090\nIf we were, we were saying we\ncould do an ACK scan with Nmap and\n\n823\n00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:21,150\nsay if we fire an ACK packet at,\nat a fire, at a system.\n\n824\n00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,890\nIf it doesn't come, if it, if it, doesn't\ncome back, well then, you know what ha,\n\n825\n00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:27,610\nand then, what have we,\nwhat have we determined?\n\n826\n00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,020\nThere's a stateful firewall there.\n\n827\n00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,280\nIf we fire at a system and\nthere's no stateful firewall,\n\n828\n00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,890\nwe're gonna get a reset back.\n\n829\n00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,630\nYou know, we're gonna get something back\nfrom that station because it went all\n\n830\n00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,990\nthe way on through.\n\n831\n00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,500\nSo, a stateful firewall can,\n\n832\n00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,840\ncan tell what the relationship\nbetween two systems communicating are.\n\n833\n00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,390\nAnd tell if that's\nsupposed to be happening.\n\n834\n00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,610\nAnd take the appropriate\naction as necessary.\n\n835\n00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,270\n>> Yeah.\nSo it's, it's a little more powerful.\n\n836\n00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,420\nIt can dive in there and look at.\n\n837\n00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,130\nThere's that word again.\n\n838\n00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,600\nI got to stop that.\n\n839\n00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,850\nIt can look at the.\n\n840\n00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,130\nIt knows the conversation.\n\n841\n00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,610\nIt says, okay,\nthese two are talking together.\n\n842\n00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,746\nAnd these packets are related.\n\n843\n00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:01,913\nSo it pays attention to\nthe entire conversation.\n\n844\n00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:05,634\nSo fragmentation stops being as effective,\nbecause it can look at the entire\n\n845\n00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:08,280\nconversation, start putting\nthings back together.\n\n846\n00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,744\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> To figure out what's going through So\n\n847\n00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:14,634\nI can eliminate some of those types of\nattacks which is gonna make it a little\n\n848\n00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,700\nmore difficult for us to try to bypass.\n\n849\n00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,765\nThat means one of my great techniques\nthat we used is no longer available.\n\n850\n00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:20,400\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n851\n00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,900\n>> All right.\n\n852\n00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,600\nSo we have these different types of\nfirewalls that we have to deal with,\n\n853\n00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,140\nwhich we're going to have to\ndetermine what we've got.\n\n854\n00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,850\nAnd then attacking a firewall.\n\n855\n00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,470\nHow can we go about doing\nsomething like that?\n\n856\n00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,914\n>> When you talk about\nattacking a firewall, you know,\n\n857\n00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:35,869\nreally what we're talking about is this,\n\n858\n00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:39,263\nyou are in essence attacking the firewall\nbecause you're targeting it.\n\n859\n00:40:39,263 --> 00:40:42,043\nBut instead of trying to shut it down,\nwhat we're really trying\n\n860\n00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:45,130\nto do is trying to see if we can figure\nout the nature of the firewall is and\n\n861\n00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,200\nhow it's configured\n>> There,\n\n862\n00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,440\nthere are several ways to do that.\n\n863\n00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,220\nA couple of the big ones are,\nfirst of all doing port scanning.\n\n864\n00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,192\nYou can port scan a firewall and\nthat can tell you, give you,\n\n865\n00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:58,150\ngive you some information\nabout how its configured.\n\n866\n00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,545\nBut more importantly it, you, you might\nfind certain ports are open on there\n\n867\n00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,815\nthat will, that are specific to a vendor.\n\n868\n00:41:04,815 --> 00:41:08,940\nSome vendors specifically will do,\nwill leave certain ports open.\n\n869\n00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,635\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n870\n00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:13,515\n>> That if you go to them and\ndo a, and see it open.\n\n871\n00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:17,075\nAnd then go to the next step and\ndo a banner grab, it might act,\n\n872\n00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,935\nit might actually give you\nback banner information.\n\n873\n00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,160\nThat says who the vendor of\nthe firewall is and all that.\n\n874\n00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,609\nMay seem kinda weird to do that.\n\n875\n00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:25,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But they're kinda doing it at,\n\n876\n00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,190\nyou know, partially as a deterrent.\n\n877\n00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:30,750\nThey're figuring if you're smart enough\nto do that and you scan that, and\n\n878\n00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:34,800\nyou scan that firewall and you, you find\nthat port open and do a banner grab.\n\n879\n00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,940\nThey're trying to let you know,\nhey, this is what you're facing.\n\n880\n00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,470\n>> Okay.\n>> You know, so that's,\n\n881\n00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,260\nthat's part of the reasoning behind that.\n\n882\n00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,470\nSeems kinda odd, you know,\n\n883\n00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,490\nwhy would you want to-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n884\n00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,540\n>> Do that, make someone work\nto identify your firewall.\n\n885\n00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,580\nBut this is an option on some\nfirewalls that vendors say you can\n\n886\n00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,735\nleave this on as a deterrent.\n\n887\n00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,260\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n888\n00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,870\nSo we don't really want to\ntake the firewall down.\n\n889\n00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,583\nAnd after all, that probably\nis the way into that network.\n\n890\n00:41:56,583 --> 00:42:00,578\nBut what we want to do is try to figure\nout some way through that firewall so\n\n891\n00:42:00,578 --> 00:42:02,940\nthat we can get into that network.\n\n892\n00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,600\nCuz that's the firewall's job,\nright, is to keep that unsolicited,\n\n893\n00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,410\nunwanted traffic outside.\n\n894\n00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,470\nSo what I need to do is determine\nthe way I can burrow through it or\n\n895\n00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,970\nwork my way through it so\nthat I can get to the juicy stuff inside.\n\n896\n00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,780\n>> Yeah ex, ex, exactly.\n\n897\n00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,110\nAnd, and, you know, it's not, and\n\n898\n00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,980\nit's not the only way you can\ngo after a firewall either.\n\n899\n00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,300\nYeah, you can port scan it.\n\n900\n00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,890\nThat's, that's one way of doing it so\nyou can identify it.\n\n901\n00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:26,821\nThe other way is through\nsomething known as firewalking.\n\n902\n00:42:26,821 --> 00:42:28,848\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which is where it really starts getting\n\n903\n00:42:28,848 --> 00:42:31,140\nyou know kinda,\nkinda neat and interesting.\n\n904\n00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,990\nFirewalking is where you run a, a script,\nagainst, a script on your system.\n\n905\n00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,460\nIts designed to fire specially\ndesigned probe requests and\n\n906\n00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,080\nscans against the firewall.\n\n907\n00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,520\nWith the idea that reverse engineers\nwhat the rule set looks like.\n\n908\n00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,510\nYou know so once it does that it spits\nout something at the, as the end result\n\n909\n00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,450\nsaying this what I've determined to\nbe the rule set on that firewall.\n\n910\n00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:58,660\nOnce you know that those things\nare usually, reasonably,\n\n911\n00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,200\nkinda sorta accurate,\ndepending on your, on the situation.\n\n912\n00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:06,380\nThen you can start positioning your attack\neven that much better because you know\n\n913\n00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,655\nwhat passes, what doesn't pass, and what's\nand how it's going to react to that.\n\n914\n00:43:09,655 --> 00:43:12,715\n>> Right, right, okay.\n\n915\n00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,105\nSo what else do we need to worry\nabout with our firewalls then?\n\n916\n00:43:15,105 --> 00:43:16,825\nWe've talked about\nthe three different types.\n\n917\n00:43:16,825 --> 00:43:19,895\nI know in, in the chat room I saw\na question I think Makayla asked,\n\n918\n00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:20,695\nwas a four or three.\n\n919\n00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:24,172\nAnd we said there were\nthree types of the packet,\n\n920\n00:43:24,172 --> 00:43:27,586\nthe state full and\nthe application level firewall.\n\n921\n00:43:27,586 --> 00:43:28,979\n>> Yeah.\n>> [COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n922\n00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:32,966\n>> There's also another at that monitors\nsession information, that works,\n\n923\n00:43:32,966 --> 00:43:34,728\nthat works at a different level.\n\n924\n00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:38,570\nThe OSI model so that it can watch\nhow the session has established,\n\n925\n00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,990\nbut we're not gonna worry\nabout that one too much.\n\n926\n00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,404\n>> Okay.\n>> And then I saw someone also mentioned\n\n927\n00:43:43,404 --> 00:43:45,881\nthe cloud based you know firewalls.\n\n928\n00:43:45,881 --> 00:43:46,648\n>> Mm.\n\n929\n00:43:46,648 --> 00:43:47,274\nRight.\n\n930\n00:43:47,274 --> 00:43:52,120\n>> Yeah those are, those are whole,\nwhole beast unto themselves.\n\n931\n00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:54,340\nAnd we're not gonna [LAUGH] touch those,\nbut you're right.\n\n932\n00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,170\n>> And anyways still, still a firewall.\n\n933\n00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,690\n>> Yep.\n>> And it's doing the same thing and\n\n934\n00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,100\nit's either gonna do or not do,\nthe, the packet inspection.\n\n935\n00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,080\nWhere it looks inside it and proxy and\n\n936\n00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,245\nthings like that it just happens to be\nlocated out of the cloud I'm assuming.\n\n937\n00:44:06,245 --> 00:44:08,530\n>> Yeah, that's, that you're just,\nwhat you're doing is ya, you're, you're,\n\n938\n00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:10,340\nyou're going to a service\nprovider an ISP and\n\n939\n00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,760\nyou're buying infrastructure as a service\nis what they call that you know.\n\n940\n00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,040\nSo, you go, you, you have them, da,\nhost your firewall on their systems and\n\n941\n00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,368\nyou're, you're, you're, you're done.\n\n942\n00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:20,051\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n943\n00:44:20,051 --> 00:44:21,300\n>> You don't have to.\n\n944\n00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,239\nYou put. [CROSSTALK] >> Same types of\ntechniques I would use to work against\n\n945\n00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:25,840\nsomething like that as well.\n\n946\n00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,790\n>> Yeah.\n\n947\n00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:29,670\n>> All right, so firewalls,\nwe're good with those then?\n\n948\n00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,960\n>> Yes.\nI think we're good.\n\n949\n00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,930\n>> All right,\nthen let's talk about honey pots.\n\n950\n00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:34,720\nI like honey pots.\n\n951\n00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,910\nThat always leads to a very interesting\ndiscussion, you know who's your favorite,\n\n952\n00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,968\nWinnie the Pooh, Tigger, Eeyore, piglet.\n\n953\n00:44:42,968 --> 00:44:43,892\n>> Exactly.\n\n954\n00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:48,120\n[LAUGH] No, honey pots\nare interesting beast aren't they?\n\n955\n00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:53,910\nYeah, that can be extremely,\ninteresting to, to say the least.\n\n956\n00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,930\nMost, and most people kinda are that way,\n\n957\n00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,690\nyou know\n>> When they look at honey pots,\n\n958\n00:44:57,690 --> 00:44:59,785\nthey're like, wow,\nthat's kind of a strange beast to have.\n\n959\n00:44:59,785 --> 00:45:00,420\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n960\n00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,180\n>> Because, you know, what a,\n\n961\n00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,530\nwhat a honey pot really boils down\nto is you put something out there.\n\n962\n00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,390\nThat's designed to, you know,\nattract an attacker, and it sounds\n\n963\n00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,500\ncounter to everything in the world\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n964\n00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,310\n>> It's like, you know,\n\n965\n00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,605\nyou're doing what now?\n\n966\n00:45:11,605 --> 00:45:15,590\nDidn't we just spend all this\ntime figuring how to stop that?\n\n967\n00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:16,250\n>> Yeah, you did.\n\n968\n00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,725\n>> Right, exactly,\nwhy do I wanna draw them in?\n\n969\n00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:21,554\nIt's like people taking, you know,\nthose bug zappers with the light and\n\n970\n00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:24,427\nthe electricity [INAUDIBLE]\nzaps a little bit [SOUND].\n\n971\n00:45:24,427 --> 00:45:26,204\nPut it right on your porch right\nover where you're sitting.\n\n972\n00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:26,866\nIt's like, no.\n>> Yeah.\n\n973\n00:45:26,866 --> 00:45:29,240\n>> That's drawing the bugs right to you.\n\n974\n00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,270\nYeah, that's not where you\nwant to hang that thing.\n\n975\n00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:34,320\nBut, so honey pots, you know,\nkinda sound like the same thing.\n\n976\n00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,760\nWhy would I want to put the honey pot\non my network that's going to draw in\n\n977\n00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,030\nthe bad guys?\n\n978\n00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,200\n>> Yeah, and, a, and, and that, and\nthat's the thing initially we get into it.\n\n979\n00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,770\nThey put an, when you look at\nit going why would you do that?\n\n980\n00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,483\nWell, decoy for one.\n\n981\n00:45:46,483 --> 00:45:50,485\nYou could stick that thing in your DMZ and\nwith your other legitimate resources and\n\n982\n00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:51,650\nyou make the honey pot.\n\n983\n00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,500\nAnd this is the trick,\n\n984\n00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,762\nyou make the honey pot look vulnerable,\nbut not too vulnerable.\n\n985\n00:45:56,762 --> 00:45:58,150\n>> [INAUDIBLE] stupid vulnerable, right?\n\n986\n00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:01,530\n>> Yeah, if you do it they're like yeah,\nyou're an idiot, do you think I'm stupid?\n\n987\n00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:03,260\n>> Hasn't been patched since 1997, yay.\n\n988\n00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,210\n>> Yeah, it's running Windows 98.\n\n989\n00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,152\nOh, yeah, sure those exist.\n\n990\n00:46:07,152 --> 00:46:11,984\nSo, you, you kinda, you've got to fit,\nyou've got to figure out, you know,\n\n991\n00:46:11,984 --> 00:46:13,560\nwhat, where the line is.\n\n992\n00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,760\nWhere it looks like hey,\nyou missed a patch or two.\n\n993\n00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But not, let,\n\n994\n00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:20,070\noh yeah you haven't upgraded you know,\nyou know, since, you know, wherever,\n\n995\n00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,560\nunless it's whenever.\n\n996\n00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,220\nYou know, so you've got, what so\nwhen you get these things.\n\n997\n00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,860\nThat you, you put it,\nyou put em out there.\n\n998\n00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:28,980\nHow can you create one?\n\n999\n00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,242\nYou can create one manually.\n\n1000\n00:46:30,242 --> 00:46:32,681\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> That's how the first generation ones\n\n1001\n00:46:32,681 --> 00:46:36,926\nwere, where someone would get a piece of\nhardware and drop all the stuff on and\n\n1002\n00:46:36,926 --> 00:46:41,310\nconfigure it to be quite,\nto be almost there but not entirely there.\n\n1003\n00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,380\nThe trick with doing\nsomething like that is,\n\n1004\n00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,080\nis that you really better know your stuff.\n\n1005\n00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,965\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you miss anything\n\n1006\n00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:48,160\n>> That could be catastrophic.\n\n1007\n00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,135\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1008\n00:46:49,135 --> 00:46:52,125\n>> Then they had, then they started\nyou know, bringing out you know,\n\n1009\n00:46:52,125 --> 00:46:56,725\nsome newer ones that were software\npackages, which are still a lot of them.\n\n1010\n00:46:56,725 --> 00:46:59,025\nWhich are still a lot of\nthese things out there.\n\n1011\n00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,245\nThere's one like you know, what is it?\n\n1012\n00:47:02,245 --> 00:47:03,985\n>> Honey Net.\n>> KFSensor is one.\n\n1013\n00:47:03,985 --> 00:47:04,735\n>> Yeah, another one.\n\n1014\n00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:07,045\n>> Yeah there's,\nthere's the Honeynet project.\n\n1015\n00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:08,610\nYeah, you're right, there's that.\n\n1016\n00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,150\n>> There's,\nthere's plenty of these sayings,\n\n1017\n00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,510\nthere's plenty of these saying you know,\no, o, you know, out there.\n\n1018\n00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:15,910\nSo you have the software based ones.\n\n1019\n00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:19,170\nYou can install it and\nit makes your system look vulnerable, and\n\n1020\n00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,890\nyou can tell it to do different things.\n\n1021\n00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,250\nAnd then they have the hardware based\nones, which are, it can be just a box that\n\n1022\n00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:27,390\nyou plug a network cable into and\nit looks vulnerable.\n\n1023\n00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:30,094\nAnd those ones are actually kinda\nneat because you can have a,\n\n1024\n00:47:30,094 --> 00:47:32,487\na web-based interface for\nit, which a lot of them do.\n\n1025\n00:47:32,487 --> 00:47:36,600\nYou go to the web-based interface like you\nwould for a wireless router, like at home.\n\n1026\n00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,040\nYou got to that wireless,\nthat-that-that portal and\n\n1027\n00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,828\nyou just check a couple things in there\nand it becomes whatever you tell it to be.\n\n1028\n00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:44,533\nYou know?\n\n1029\n00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:47,430\nAnd, and they dow, they release\nupdates for that periodically.\n\n1030\n00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,352\nSo, you, when are new operating system or\n\n1031\n00:47:50,352 --> 00:47:53,080\nsomething comes out that you'll\ndownload the update to it.\n\n1032\n00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:56,120\nAnd you can just select it off a drop\ndown list and tell it what you want,\n\n1033\n00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,720\nwhat else you want it to look like.\n\n1034\n00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,326\nAnd you hit Submit and it becomes that.\n\n1035\n00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:01,415\n>> Right.\n>> It's, it's actually pretty neat.\n\n1036\n00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:05,405\nThey are pricey but, you know, it's, it's,\nit's, it's just something else you can do.\n\n1037\n00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:05,944\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1038\n00:48:05,944 --> 00:48:09,473\n>> You know, and they, and, and,\nand automates a lot of this,\n\n1039\n00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:11,435\nlot of this stuff for you, you know.\n\n1040\n00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:15,131\n>> Yeah, exactly, and it's,\nit's Kind of fascinating to look at.\n\n1041\n00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:18,668\nYou know when we talk about setting the\ntarget out there and I've heard different\n\n1042\n00:48:18,668 --> 00:48:22,308\ntactics like, well, if, if, if you make\nthis the low hanging fruit, right, and\n\n1043\n00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:25,070\nthat's hopefully the one\nthat they're attacking.\n\n1044\n00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:29,770\nEh, and then that should set off you know,\nentries in log files, IDSs, IPSs or\n\n1045\n00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,790\nwhat have you.\n\n1046\n00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:32,380\nAnd, and we've noticed the attack there.\n\n1047\n00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:35,300\nI've seen people you know,\nload it up with fake data so\n\n1048\n00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,210\nit doesn't look like one\nof your actual servers.\n\n1049\n00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,220\nI mean, if there's nothing on there,\nno services running or\n\n1050\n00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,030\nanything like that whether it's virtual or\n\n1051\n00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:44,560\nphysical it's gonna be obviously\nthe bad guy, this is not a real server.\n\n1052\n00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,382\nIf it's too easy to get into,\nit's probably a honey pot right.\n\n1053\n00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:52,694\nSo, you want to make it look realistic,\nlike part of your network, yet not it have\n\n1054\n00:48:52,694 --> 00:48:57,408\nanything sensitive on there that they\ncould actually, that could do harm to you.\n\n1055\n00:48:57,408 --> 00:49:01,790\nYou know should we talk about\nthe legal aspects of it.\n\n1056\n00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:06,275\nI know there's always a big debate whether\nor not honey pots are entrapment or not.\n\n1057\n00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:09,375\n>> Yeah, I see that,\nin our discussion it came up.\n\n1058\n00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,940\n>> Did they ask about that?\n\n1059\n00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:16,465\n>> Yeah someone mentioned earlier decoy,\ndetection and evidence.\n\n1060\n00:49:16,465 --> 00:49:18,645\nAnd first are absolutely true.\n\n1061\n00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:21,480\nIs you can act as a decoy\nto attract attention.\n\n1062\n00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,670\nDetection, they can help you\nwith that cause they start,\n\n1063\n00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,180\nthey can, you can place them nearby,\nsome of your, some, IDs and\n\n1064\n00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,930\nall that to start picking up attacks\nthat might be on the way in.\n\n1065\n00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:34,720\nSome people actually, place a honey pot\noutside their, their outer firewall where\n\n1066\n00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,375\non the inside so they can see what's\ncoming and what's coming out the back end.\n\n1067\n00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:37,910\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1068\n00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,350\n>> So they can see how well\ntheir fences are working.\n\n1069\n00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:45,910\nBut that last one, evidence,\nthat's kinda tricky because, I,\n\n1070\n00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,265\nand I also saw the word\nentrapment used on here.\n\n1071\n00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:48,890\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah.\n\n1072\n00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,610\nIt's, it's real, it's really tricky.\n\n1073\n00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,450\nI mean, I,\nin fact it's been argued whether or\n\n1074\n00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,730\nnot a honeypot would be even\nconsidered any form of entrapment.\n\n1075\n00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,490\nBecause it's, it's,\nit's, it's you know not,\n\n1076\n00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:04,715\nnot a you know not to make this you know\nyou know crude or anything like that.\n\n1077\n00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:05,880\n>> Mh-hm.\n>> But it's, it's,\n\n1078\n00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,220\nit's the same thing you see\nin these police shows these,\n\n1079\n00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,800\nthese reality shows where-\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n1080\n00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,730\n>> Like cops and all that where they go,\n\n1081\n00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,615\nwhere they you know place undercover\noffice on a corner as a hooker.\n\n1082\n00:50:14,615 --> 00:50:15,330\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n1083\n00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:19,910\n>> And you know just, just placing\nsomeone there, that's not entrapment.\n\n1084\n00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:22,025\nThey didn't force that person to go up.\n\n1085\n00:50:22,025 --> 00:50:24,780\n>> Right.\n>> And, and solicit anything.\n\n1086\n00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,150\nSo, no, it's not entrapment, and\nthat's been fought in court several times.\n\n1087\n00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,690\nAnd it's always been upheld.\n\n1088\n00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,070\nIt's the same thing here.\n\n1089\n00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:36,830\nMe putting a honey pot out, is not,\nI'm not putting it out, and telling you,\n\n1090\n00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,060\nhey you've got to go out and attack it.\n\n1091\n00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,180\nI'm just putting it out there.\n\n1092\n00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:43,660\nThere's no reason under any normal\ncircumstances you would need to go there.\n\n1093\n00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,600\n>> Right.\n>> So you had a reason to go there.\n\n1094\n00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,260\n>> That's my opinion and\nI think it's most people's at this point.\n\n1095\n00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,360\nIs the fact that you know I,\nI'm not coercing you.\n\n1096\n00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,280\nI'm not enticing you to, you know,\nI'm not going to your house and\n\n1097\n00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,600\nsaying hey look at this IP address.\n\n1098\n00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,240\nIt looks really easy to target right?\n\n1099\n00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,560\nI put it out there,\nI'm using it to help defend my network.\n\n1100\n00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,230\nYou were the one who chose to attack\nit so, to me I don't see how it's en,\n\n1101\n00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,080\nentrapment.\n\n1102\n00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,020\nBut I know some people kinda have\na different opinion on that.\n\n1103\n00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,430\n>> Yeah.\n>> So it might be something that you have\n\n1104\n00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:14,070\nto look at with your local law,\nlocal laws and\n\n1105\n00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:16,170\nregulations to make sure that you're not.\n\n1106\n00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:20,060\nDo anything that's going to get you in\ntrouble if you're running one of these.\n\n1107\n00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,700\nI know they're used in some places not\nas a decoy, but as a learning thing.\n\n1108\n00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,940\nRight, to see what attack,\nlike some of the governments and\n\n1109\n00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,250\nplaces like that will run.\n\n1110\n00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:33,160\nHoney pots,\njust to see what people are doing.\n\n1111\n00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,540\nHow are they gonna attack this system?\n\n1112\n00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,860\nLet's pick up their techniques so\nI can better defend against them.\n\n1113\n00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,440\nSo they're, they're, it's not that\nthey're, again, not entrapping anybody but\n\n1114\n00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,850\nthey want to see what you guys,\nwhat the bad guys are doing.\n\n1115\n00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:46,955\n>> Yeah, they are, they are definitely\nused as a, as a learning resource.\n\n1116\n00:51:46,955 --> 00:51:47,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1117\n00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,450\n>> And just research tools.\n\n1118\n00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,220\nYou know, those both kind of\nfit in the same category.\n\n1119\n00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:56,350\nTo help us refine you know,\nwhat it is that we're our own skills and\n\n1120\n00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:59,020\ntools to make them that\nmuch better because we can\n\n1121\n00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,370\nlearn about the types of\nattacks that are out there.\n\n1122\n00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,630\nYou know that's where you get\ntools in addition to this.\n\n1123\n00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,620\nYou get tools like, it was mentioned here\nduring the class, that IP viking site.\n\n1124\n00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:13,030\nAnd that, what that digital\nattack map site that was put out.\n\n1125\n00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:16,810\n>> Yes. Mm-hm. >> Those those t,\ntwo sites do use stuff like this.\n\n1126\n00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,180\nThey do use other things, but\n\n1127\n00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,215\nthey also use honey pots as part of\ntheir stuff to learn those attacks.\n\n1128\n00:52:21,215 --> 00:52:22,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You know,\n\n1129\n00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:26,440\nso we can get some early intel on it and\nlearn to adapt and, and\n\n1130\n00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,230\ntweak our techniques to get\nthe best to get the best result.\n\n1131\n00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:31,230\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n1132\n00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,130\nIt is honey pots.\n\n1133\n00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:32,750\nI mean, let's face it.\n\n1134\n00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:36,870\nLook, the software based ones they can\nmimic you know, just a single server.\n\n1135\n00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:40,840\nYou can actually set up an entire\nsegment on some of those guys.\n\n1136\n00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,600\nAnd have an entire hunting net\nif you want to call it that so\n\n1137\n00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,950\na lot of cool things\nyou can do with those.\n\n1138\n00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,630\nAgain, and really the main goal of them is\nthey're either going to be research as you\n\n1139\n00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,640\nsaid, or to entice somebody.\n\n1140\n00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,190\nI shouldn't use the word entice.\n\n1141\n00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:59,270\nYou know, draw the attention away\nfrom your critical resources and\n\n1142\n00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:02,600\ngive you time to discover the attack and\nstop the attack.\n\n1143\n00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:07,430\nBefore they make it to your actual data\nand your critical resources there.\n\n1144\n00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,110\nAnd it's something that we as, you know,\nwe have to be careful of because you can.\n\n1145\n00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,360\nI forgot where I was going with that.\n\n1146\n00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,340\nBut you know, th,\nthat's really the goal of a honeypot.\n\n1147\n00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,700\nEither research or to draw them away from,\nlike, critical resources.\n\n1148\n00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:21,540\nIn fact, I think we, when we talked\nabout your, yeah, nevermind.\n\n1149\n00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:23,474\nI think we, we're going right there.\n\n1150\n00:53:23,474 --> 00:53:25,453\n>> [CROSSTALK] We're a team,\nI'm already thinking ahead.\n\n1151\n00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:26,058\n>> Right.\n\n1152\n00:53:26,058 --> 00:53:27,950\nI was going to say, the other day,-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1153\n00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:30,590\n>> When we were talking about that,\nwe called it a honey pot.\n\n1154\n00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:31,720\n>> Yeah.\nBut you know,\n\n1155\n00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,390\nyou guys saw it yesterday,\nwhen I used this little baby.\n\n1156\n00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,760\nYou know,\nthis is the WiFi pineapple again.\n\n1157\n00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,230\nAnd I told you about that\nlittle prank I pulled when\n\n1158\n00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,360\nI was on vacation a little bit ago.\n\n1159\n00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,550\nThat's, that, by no stretch,\nwas, was illegal.\n\n1160\n00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:52,320\nMe just putting the thing out there is\nnot, is not is not open license for\n\n1161\n00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:55,240\nyou to atta, is not,\nis open license for you to use it.\n\n1162\n00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,420\n>> Right.\n>> You know, so,\n\n1163\n00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,150\nby the fact that it was put out there and\njust said,\n\n1164\n00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:01,890\nhey it's an open access point\nsomeone looks and says, hey,\n\n1165\n00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,480\nthere's an open access point, they\nknow they're not supposed to be there.\n\n1166\n00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,160\nJust like saying, the door's open\non the house, can you go in?\n\n1167\n00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,200\nNo, it's still breaking in.\n\n1168\n00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,750\nIt might be incredibly stupid to let your\ndoor open, but it's not open license for\n\n1169\n00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,820\nsomeone to come by and\nstart stealing your stuff.\n\n1170\n00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,430\nNo more than putting this out\nthere is an open license for\n\n1171\n00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,490\nsomeone to start using my wifi.\n\n1172\n00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:22,880\nWithout my permission.\n\n1173\n00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,240\nYou know, so honey pots are the same way.\n\n1174\n00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,290\nBut you know, this is one of those things,\nwe're getting into this discussion.\n\n1175\n00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:29,860\nWe don't want to get drawn into it to far.\n\n1176\n00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:31,180\n>> Right.\n>> But, you know, you kind of,\n\n1177\n00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:34,110\nyou guys can see where this is going, and\n\n1178\n00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:38,360\nexpect to have to have this discussion\nat some point if you ever deploy.\n\n1179\n00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:39,130\n>> A honey pot.\n\n1180\n00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,110\nSomeone's going to ask you.\n\n1181\n00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:42,730\nYou might have the legal\ndepartment ask you.\n\n1182\n00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:45,180\n>> Right.\n>> That's there job to figure that out.\n\n1183\n00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,400\nHere in the US.\n\n1184\n00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,830\nI am not a lawyer, and\nI don't claim to be.\n\n1185\n00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,542\nWe're going to start a disclaimer.\n\n1186\n00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,349\nRight here.\n\n1187\n00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:54,771\n[LAUGH] In post and besides.\n\n1188\n00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:57,950\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah I played a lawyer on tv.\n\n1189\n00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:58,835\n>> Yeah.\n\n1190\n00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:01,430\n[LAUGH] Besides if I was a lawyer and\n\n1191\n00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,505\nlooking like this you should\nnot be trusting me anyways.\n\n1192\n00:55:03,505 --> 00:55:05,290\n[LAUGH] That's on you.\n\n1193\n00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:09,831\nSo I look like I, I'm more on\nthe supply side of of illegals stuff so\n\n1194\n00:55:09,831 --> 00:55:12,230\n[LAUGH] but you know so, yeah, it's.\n\n1195\n00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:18,000\nYou need to check with what\nyou're what you're to,\n\n1196\n00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,460\nwith local laws to see what's going on.\n\n1197\n00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:26,630\nHere in the US it's really\nnot considered entrapment.\n\n1198\n00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:29,340\nTo the best of my knowledge, I've never\nheard of it being called entrapment.\n\n1199\n00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,420\n>> Right.\n>> It came into question a long time ago,\n\n1200\n00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:35,820\nand that's been addressed, and\nsince then they've moved on from that.\n\n1201\n00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:40,220\n>> And like Shawn said, we're not\nhere to give you any legal advice so\n\n1202\n00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,130\ndo your due diligence, and check on it.\n\n1203\n00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,900\nIf you've got a legal department,\nthen talk to them.\n\n1204\n00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,590\nIf you don't do your research, talk to\nyour local law enforcement agencies.\n\n1205\n00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,940\nThey probably have an IT department or\nsomething that deals with cyber crime.\n\n1206\n00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:52,940\nAnd ask them and\n\n1207\n00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:55,150\nsee what they think because we\ndon't want to get you in trouble.\n\n1208\n00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,430\nAnd the other thing is that these\nkind of laws are changing, you know,\n\n1209\n00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,020\nthe technology's evolving.\n\n1210\n00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,670\nAn, an, and, and so are the laws.\n\n1211\n00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:06,140\nThe laws are having a hard time,\nI think, keeping up with technology.\n\n1212\n00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,010\nSo what might've been true two years ago,\nmight not be true today.\n\n1213\n00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,560\nIt might not be true tomorrow.\n\n1214\n00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,383\nSo just make sure you do your due\ndiligence before you try to do anything\n\n1215\n00:56:14,383 --> 00:56:15,000\nlike that.\n\n1216\n00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,438\nOr recommend another company\nthat does something like that.\n\n1217\n00:56:17,438 --> 00:56:18,077\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1218\n00:56:18,077 --> 00:56:22,370\n>> I think it would be,\nwould be safe, anyway [COUGH].\n\n1219\n00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:22,890\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1220\n00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:24,010\n>> All right, Sean.\n\n1221\n00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:25,610\nWell how did we do on HoneyBuzz?\n\n1222\n00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,100\nAnything else we wanna talk\nabout with those guys?\n\n1223\n00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:32,030\n>> You know, I thi-, I, I think, we've,\nyou know, on those, on those two areas,\n\n1224\n00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,930\nI think kinda, I think we got it.\n\n1225\n00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,400\nYou know, you're gonna have to know\nthe different types of firewalls, and\n\n1226\n00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,470\nyou're gonna have to know what\na honey pot is, and honeypot,\n\n1227\n00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,300\nthere's really not much else to say.\n\n1228\n00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,230\nYou know, there's,\n\n1229\n00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,575\nthey're not, they're not really\nsupposed to be aggressively defended.\n\n1230\n00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:46,120\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they're, and\n\n1231\n00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,830\nthere's, attacking them,\nthat's what they're there for.\n\n1232\n00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,810\n>> Right.\n>> So what else do you mention?\n\n1233\n00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:51,620\nYou know they're out there,\n\n1234\n00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,781\ncuz there could be something\nthat you place out there.\n\n1235\n00:56:54,781 -->

you.\n\n4\n00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:16,040\nJust kinda some quick things that\nI think are good guidance for\n\n5\n00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,500\nyou going through the actual exam,\nor getting ready for\n\n6\n00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,560\nyour exam, and then getting ready for\nwhat you do post CEH.\n\n7\n00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,030\nReally, you know, first thing\nyou wanna do is, is go through,\n\n8\n00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,130\nis go through all the stuff that we talked\nabout, go through the episodes again,\n\n9\n00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,360\nstart getting your hands dirty.\n\n10\n00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,970\nIf you have, if you have the book you can\ngo through some of the exercises that I've\n\n11\n00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,750\nput in there to get yourself to get\nyourself familiar with the tools.\n\n12\n00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,110\nStart training your eyes on\nwhat types of things to see.\n\n13\n00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,340\nAnd then once you've got the tools and\n\n14\n00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,720\ntechniques together, then start\nlooking at the overall process on\n\n15\n00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,530\nhow you can take stuff from one tool\nto the next tool to the next tool.\n\n16\n00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,680\nWhat the progression is through each\none of these steps to gain access and\n\n17\n00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,390\nentry to a system, you know.\n\n18\n00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,000\nSo that's the first thing I\nwould really recommend you do.\n\n19\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,540\nAnd until you're really\ncomfortable with the tools,\n\n20\n00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,780\nI wouldn't recommend going in and\nthen, and, and sit in the, the exam.\n\n21\n00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,395\nAfter you've done that I would recommend,\nyou know,\n\n22\n00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:20,180\ngo, once you feel fresh and\ngood with all the material,\n\n23\n00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,430\nthen that's probably your time to,\nyou know, to sit the exam.\n\n24\n00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,580\nUsually, I tell individuals that they're\ngetting ready for the, when they're\n\n25\n00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,210\ngetting ready for the exam, or asking\nspecifically when they should take it.\n\n26\n00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,080\nThat's kinda you.\n\n27\n00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,740\nEach one of you is out there is you know,\npresumably an adult,\n\n28\n00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,200\nhas taken tests before, or\nknows your own testing style.\n\n29\n00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,150\nBut generally,\nI've noticed the sweet spot, on average,\n\n30\n00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,740\nis about a week after you're done going\nthrough the material, to kinda let\n\n31\n00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,900\neverything set in and give time to kinda\ngel, and review anything you need to.\n\n32\n00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,170\nAnd usually, I tell people,\n\n33\n00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,630\ndon't wait longer than a month after\nyou've done something like this.\n\n34\n00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,449\nSo don't go wa,\nwatching all these episodes and then wait,\n\n35\n00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:01,218\nand kinda, you know, lollygag, and\n\n36\n00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:05,389\nthen take the stuff a month after you're\na month after you've last watched it.\n\n37\n00:02:05,389 --> 00:02:07,060\nYou're gonna get rusty on it.\n\n38\n00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,150\nThese skills are perishable.\n\n39\n00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,318\nYou will lose them if you don't,\nif you don't use them often enough.\n\n40\n00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,190\nSo you wanna use them, get used to\nthe terminology, the techniques, and\n\n41\n00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,250\nhow everything fits together.\n\n42\n00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,840\nAnd then once you've done that, you know,\ngo ahead and take the test, and\n\n43\n00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,820\nyou should be successful.\n\n44\n00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,900\nI also add in something out, when you\nsit the actual exam, the exam is a lot\n\n45\n00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,880\nof multiple choice, and there are some\nexhibits on there where you're asked\n\n46\n00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,190\nto look at things and kinda and, and,\nand, and to see what's happening.\n\n47\n00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,870\nSo that's where\nthe train-your-eye part comes in.\n\n48\n00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:45,020\nBut also something else that fits into it\nis the 125 questions, it's four hours.\n\n49\n00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,030\nIf you're gonna be doing that, one of\nthe big parts of it is time management.\n\n50\n00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,260\nMake sure that, you know,\nyou, you do have four hours.\n\n51\n00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,272\nIt's plenty of time, but I've seen people\nand heard people run out of time on that,\n\n52\n00:02:58,272 --> 00:03:02,590\nmainly because they got too hung\nup on one individual question.\n\n53\n00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,930\nIf you find yourself getting hung up on\na question, just mark it and come back,\n\n54\n00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,200\nyou can do that.\n\n55\n00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,640\nAnd usually, you'll find something\nelse on one of the later questions\n\n56\n00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,490\nthat knocks something loose in your head,\nthat allows you to go back and\n\n57\n00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,720\nanswer the earlier question.\n\n58\n00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,550\nThat's what I found.\n\n59\n00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,898\nIf you test differently than that,\nthen hey, that's, that's fine.\n\n60\n00:03:21,898 --> 00:03:26,110\nI, you know, I'm just giving some general\nthings that I think you should do.\n\n61\n00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,280\nNow, once you are completed with\nthat exam, what do you do after?\n\n62\n00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,370\nWhat's the next step from there?\n\n63\n00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,830\nWell, there are,\nthere are several routes you can take.\n\n64\n00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,596\nOne of the things that I recommend\ndoing is taking a is going through\n\n65\n00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:41,910\na forensics training, you know?\n\n66\n00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,500\nAnd we're actually here at ITProTV\n\n67\n00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,390\ngonna be having a course\nlike that available soon.\n\n68\n00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,540\nWhat, what we're gonna do with forensics,\nand\n\n69\n00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,350\nwhere it fits into ethical hacking is\nthat ethical hacking, we teach you,\n\n70\n00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,920\nyou know, how to use these tools,\nand how to attack a system.\n\n71\n00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,940\nBut it's another thing to see it from the\nforensic side, and what type of tracks and\n\n72\n00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,320\ndetails are left on the system after an\nattack, where you have zero knowledge, and\n\n73\n00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,290\nhave to gain evidence, and\n\n74\n00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,040\nbuild up your knowledge base\nto figure out what happened.\n\n75\n00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,010\nYou know, so a forensics person\nwould be a next logical step\n\n76\n00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,740\neven if you never work as\na forensics technician.\n\n77\n00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,910\nIt's gonna help you become a be,\na better ethical hacker.\n\n78\n00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,616\nYou know, if you do wanna go do forensics,\nthen yes, having a CEH in your background,\n\n79\n00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:31,370\nand progressing on is gonna make\nyou better forensic investigator.\n\n80\n00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,960\nYou know, then there's other routes to,\nto, to go as well.\n\n81\n00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,331\nYou could go out to become a, you know,\nto, to become a security administrator.\n\n82\n00:04:38,331 --> 00:04:40,838\nYou could work on somebody's\nred teams that co,\n\n83\n00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:44,340\nthat contract with governments and\ncompanies, you can do that.\n\n84\n00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,395\nI mean, there's a lot of things that,\nyou know, open for you i,\n\n85\n00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,630\nif you wanna pursue them.\n\n86\n00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,850\nSo it's just a question of just you know,\nwhat direction you wanna go.\n\n87\n00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,950\nAnother thing I'd, I'd recommend,\nif you're gonna obtain the CEH and\n\n88\n00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,390\nyou don't already have a CISSP,\nI think that's a very good thing for\n\n89\n00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:05,490\nyou to add to your portfolio, or\nconsider adding to your portfolio.\n\n90\n00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:08,560\nITProTV has a great course on the CISSP.\n\n91\n00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,952\nAnd the reason why I say take it or\nto consider taking the,\n\n92\n00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:18,550\nthe CISSP alongside the CEH is the fact\nthat those two compliment one another.\n\n93\n00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,535\nThe CISSP is a lot of theoretical,\na lot of conceptual stuff.\n\n94\n00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,010\nThe CEH is, is technical.\n\n95\n00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,730\nThe two really kinda have\nsome crossover between them.\n\n96\n00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,740\nSo if you take one, the other kinda fills\nit out, and fills in your knowledge.\n\n97\n00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,328\nYou get conceptual on the CISSP,\nand you're kinda of like,\n\n98\n00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:36,930\nwhat does that really mean?\n\n99\n00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,050\nYou can get in the trenches with the CEH,\nand\n\n100\n00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,900\nknow exactly what it means when they're\ntalking the conceptual on the CEH.\n\n101\n00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,230\nIf you do the technical stuff for\n\n102\n00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,440\nthe CEH, you'll know how it fits into the\nbig picture from management's perspective,\n\n103\n00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,970\nand the legal perspective,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,150\nSo they both really fit together really,\nreally, really nicely.\n\n105\n00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,780\nSo it's something I'd strongly\nrecommend you'd consider doing.\n\n106\n00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,180\nYou know, after that, you know,\njust, just choose you know,\n\n107\n00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,676\nwhere you wanna work in the field and,\nyou know en, enjoy yourself.\n\n108\n00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:08,245\nKeep your skills, you know,\nup to date, and you should be fine.\n\n109\n00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,100\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
