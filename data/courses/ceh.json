  "description": "EC-Council's Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) certification covers concepts and tools related to exploiting systems, networks, devices and operating platforms. It is designed to get an individual into the world of pen testing to learn techniques of how to test a network or infrastructure. This includes hacking concepts such as vulnerability assessment, network intrusion, reverse engineering, defacing websites, damaging network appliances, launching distributed denial-of-service attacks, massive worm propagation, breaking passwords, brute-forcing authentication systems, cracking encryption, exploiting systems, advance viruses, Trojans, and other malware. This certificate is targeted at site administrators, security professionals, auditors and anyone who is concerned about the integrity of the network infrastructure that has practical real world experience to support this type of equipment.",

          "description": "Properly securing servers and networks is a significant challenge due to the ever changing attack methods used by hackers. The most successful security technicians have a thorough understanding of the tools and techniques used by the hackers themselves. This practical knowledge of attack methods allows a defender to assemble more flexible protections for their systems. The Certified Ethical Hacker certification is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical and practical knowledge. This is the first step to becoming a Penetration Tester and increasing your ability to secure a network.",

          "transcript": "1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,583\n[MUSIC]\n\n2\n00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:11,510\nIn this segment we're gonna take a look at\nthe Certified Ethical Hacker certification\n\n3\n00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,130\nand the exam content that\nwe're preparing for ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,460\nA lot of you are out there\nwondering the same question.\n\n5\n00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,020\nWhat is CEH and\nis it the right certification for me?\n\n6\n00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,340\nSo we just wanted to take a moment to\ndescribe the cert, describe the training\n\n7\n00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,550\nthat we offer and kind of show you\nwhat all is involved in this process.\n\n8\n00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,720\nNow I've got with me Sean and\nSean can you give just kind of a,\n\n9\n00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,270\na real quick just summary of\nwhat is the CEH certification?\n\n10\n00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,050\n>> That's a good question.\n\n11\n00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,140\nThe CEH is,\nis a certification that's designed to\n\n12\n00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,140\nget an individual into\nthe world of pen testing.\n\n13\n00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,310\nAnd learning how to use the various\ntools and techniques to audit or\n\n14\n00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,860\ntest their networks and their\ninfrastructure as well as their people and\n\n15\n00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,130\ntheir policies to see if if there's\nany weakness or any problems that\n\n16\n00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,245\nthey can address before, you know, not to\nbe overly dramatic, the bad guys find it.\n\n17\n00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:02,100\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it, always better that\nwe find this stuff first before they do,\n\n18\n00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,170\nbecause otherwise,\nthat's when we get in trouble, right?\n\n19\n00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,220\n>> Exactly.\n\n20\n00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,840\n>> And now that, the CEH certification is,\nit's developed and, and\n\n21\n00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,730\nadministered by an organization\ncalled the EC Council, and\n\n22\n00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,065\nthey've taken a lot of time to make sure\nthat it covers the topics that are really\n\n23\n00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:18,320\nrequired knowledge for\nanybody working in this field.\n\n24\n00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,110\nIf you're not familiar with\nthe certification in detail,\n\n25\n00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,030\nyou can always jump over to their website.\n\n26\n00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,110\nIt's eccouncil.org.\n\n27\n00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,760\nAnd they've got all the information\navailable on their site.\n\n28\n00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,990\nIf you jump to their site you'll see\na nice big button right here for\n\n29\n00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,220\nCertifications and it will take you to\nthe various certifications they've got.\n\n30\n00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,460\nAnd the one we're talking\nabout right here is CEH.\n\n31\n00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,280\nRight there on the website they\nlay out all the different ob,\n\n32\n00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,450\nobjectives that are covered and\nthere's quite a bit of stuff in there.\n\n33\n00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,150\nFrom things like background, analysis and\nassessment, security we've got tools,\n\n34\n00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,190\nsystems, and programs.\n\n35\n00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,260\nThat's what a lot of people that want to\nwatch CEH are really excited about that.\n\n36\n00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,940\nLike, I want to learn how to,\nhow to hack something.\n\n37\n00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,500\nBut it's not really just about that.\n\n38\n00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,580\nIt's about if you're going to protect\nyourself from an attack, you've\n\n39\n00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,420\ngotta understand the weapons that the,\nwell, being overly dramatic again, right?\n\n40\n00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,130\nThe, the weapons that the enemy has.\n\n41\n00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,590\nYou've gotta know how to defend yourself\nagainst the attacks that are out there.\n\n42\n00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,850\nAnd the best way to do that is\nto understand how those work.\n\n43\n00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,580\nSo sure,\na portion of the exam is based on that.\n\n44\n00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,060\nBut the majority of it is based on how you\nare going to be protecting yourself and\n\n45\n00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,380\nusing that knowledge for\nthe forces of good.\n\n46\n00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,958\nRight?\n\n47\n00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,477\nWith great power comes\ngreat responsibility and\n\n48\n00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:22,860\nwe could probably rip off 100 movie\nquotes right here, couldn't we?\n\n49\n00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,385\n>> Exactly.\n\n50\n00:02:24,385 --> 00:02:26,895\n>> So\nall of that is a part of the CEH exam.\n\n51\n00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,705\nNow, if you're getting prepared for\nthis exam,\n\n52\n00:02:28,705 --> 00:02:31,495\nthere is a little bit you need\nto know about the exam itself.\n\n53\n00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:34,305\nSo so let's start with the,\nthe details, right?\n\n54\n00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:36,825\nThe exam itself is 125 questions long.\n\n55\n00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,420\nAnd you get four hours to take it.\n\n56\n00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,990\nNow that might sound like a lot of time.\n\n57\n00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,190\nFour hours for 125 questions.\n\n58\n00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:47,170\nBut the questions are made up of\na lot of different types, right Sean?\n\n59\n00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,514\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n60\n00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:53,607\nThe questions on this exam are a mixture\nof multiple choice as well as\n\n61\n00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,150\nI like to say, labs.\n\n62\n00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,480\nBut there's a picture and\nit'll ask you to evaluate the picture and\n\n63\n00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,000\nanswer some questions on it to see\nyou know what is actually happening.\n\n64\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,500\nYou know so you'll see those two types,\nyou know, it's more.\n\n65\n00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,389\nAnd, and I should I add you know\nonto what Don was saying that it's\n\n66\n00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:15,199\n125 questions you have four hours but\nyou, it's actually plenty of time, so\n\n67\n00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,600\ndon't be too worried,\nyou know, about that.\n\n68\n00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,930\nYou know, manage your time wisely and\nyou'll be fine.\n\n69\n00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,840\n>> Now, now when you're ready\nto take the exam, well,\n\n70\n00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,690\nhow do you know you're ready, right?\n\n71\n00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:26,410\nYou've got to study.\n\n72\n00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,500\nYou've got to hit all the material.\n\n73\n00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,600\nIt's a lot of information and it's not\ndesigned for somebody just getting started\n\n74\n00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,180\nin IT or just getting started\nin security for that matter.\n\n75\n00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,250\nYou're expected to have practical\nreal world experience supporting\n\n76\n00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,230\nthis equipment.\n\n77\n00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,490\nThe only way to learn is in\nthe field because the technology is\n\n78\n00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:43,940\nconstantly changing.\n\n79\n00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,730\nAn attack that is valid\ntoday is dead tomorrow and\n\n80\n00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,500\nthere's all new attacks that are out.\n\n81\n00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500\nSo you've really got to have relevant\nknowledge far outside the field.\n\n82\n00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,980\nNow, don't let it deter you from the show\nif you're just wanting to learn more.\n\n83\n00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,610\nThis is a great resource for you.\n\n84\n00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,755\nBut if you're looking to get certified,\nthere is no substitute for\n\n85\n00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:01,610\nhandson experience with this technology.\n\n86\n00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:05,570\nYou've really got to practice and\nwork with it and stay up to date,\n\n87\n00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,290\nit's really important.\n\n88\n00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,640\nNot with the CEH exam there has been\na number of versions of it over the years\n\n89\n00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,650\nwe're currently on version 8 and\nthat's a part of staying relevant right?\n\n90\n00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,100\nAny security certification\nis going to need to do that.\n\n91\n00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,830\nSo once you become\ncertified you're not done.\n\n92\n00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,878\nNew versions of CEH will come out and\nthey'll update to encompass whatever's\n\n93\n00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:26,170\nnew, you know, the high level attacks and\nthings that are out there.\n\n94\n00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,710\nAll gets wrapped up in the exam.\n\n95\n00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,678\nIt's good knowledge to have.\n\n96\n00:04:29,678 --> 00:04:32,890\nNow the ITProTV show that we're\nabout to film is all designed to\n\n97\n00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,810\nhelp you on that certification journey.\n\n98\n00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,790\nSome of you may already have a lot of\nexperience from out there in the field\n\n99\n00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,500\nfrom working in IT.\n\n100\n00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,890\nOthers might have attended\nthe official CEH course and\n\n101\n00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:44,170\nare getting ready to take the exam.\n\n102\n00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,890\nOthers still might have no\nexperience whatsoever and\n\n103\n00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,170\nare just wanting to get\nyour feet wet in security.\n\n104\n00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:52,600\nWell, this show kind of\ncovers a lot of those bases.\n\n105\n00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,520\nWe're going to go through all of\nthe domains that are covered on\n\n106\n00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,730\nthe EC Council's official exam objectives.\n\n107\n00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,420\nWe'll get a chance to see each of those\ntopics, what they mean, what they do.\n\n108\n00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,670\nAnd Sean's got some great labs built up,\n\n109\n00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,030\nwhere you'll actually get to see a lot\nof this in practice and it's really,\n\n110\n00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,740\nreally valuable in moving you\nforward with your exam studies.\n\n111\n00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,350\nAnd once you're ready, once you feel you\nhave all that knowledge, then go and\n\n112\n00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,460\ntake that exam and\nbecome a certified ethical hacker.\n\n113\n00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,850\nWell Sean, I think that's about\nall I've got here for my overview.\n\n114\n00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,830\nCan you think of anything else\nwe should throw in just as a,\n\n115\n00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,000\na final word of warning before\nsomebody watches the show?\n\n116\n00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,670\n>> I, I would like to, you know,\nreinforce what you were saying.\n\n117\n00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,240\nOne of the points you were saying is that\nyes, you do need to be prepared to not\n\n118\n00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,550\njust listen to the lectures and see the\ndemos I am going to be doing here for you.\n\n119\n00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,040\nBut you also need to be prepared to do\nthis on your, to do this on your own,\n\n120\n00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,690\nto do some exploration, to be curious,\nto further your own knowledge.\n\n121\n00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,290\nThose are key critical skills for\nanyone that's going into ethical hacking,\n\n122\n00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,280\nalso known as pen testing,\nthat they need to have.\n\n123\n00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,340\nSo you really want, you really want to be\nprepared to do that and commit to this.\n\n124\n00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,470\nA CEH is definitely not something that can\nbe considered a paper credential, you just\n\n125\n00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,810\ncan't get a piece of paper and say you've\ngot it, you will have to prove it.\n\n126\n00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,730\n>> And you know we had a comment in\nthe chatroom about someone who's got\n\n127\n00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,640\nalready got another\nEC Council certification and\n\n128\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,560\nit reminded me of something\nI did want to mention.\n\n129\n00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,710\nThe exam cost, the exam cost is\nadvertised as $500 on most sites and\n\n130\n00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,510\none of the things that isn't necessarily\nmentioned is the exam cost is $500 if\n\n131\n00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,455\nyou take the official EC Council training\nthrough an authorized training center.\n\n132\n00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:30,300\nITProTV is not one of those authorized\ntraining centers so when you take\n\n133\n00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,980\nthe training with us you're considered\nwhat's called a self study student.\n\n134\n00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,600\nAnd the exam cost for a self study\nstudent is a little bit higher.\n\n135\n00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,670\nThey actually charge $600 for those.\n\n136\n00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,290\nSo be aware there is an exam cost.\n\n137\n00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,370\nNow if you just want to\nlearn the content and\n\n138\n00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,040\nhave an understanding of the technologies,\nwe've got you covered,\n\n139\n00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,250\nwe'll walk through it all,\nyou'll get a chance to learn that.\n\n140\n00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,520\nBut be aware that for the exam, if you\nactually want to get certified there\n\n141\n00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,030\nis an exam fee and you've got to register\nthrough EC Council to take the exam.\n\n142\n00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:57,060\nYou do not take the exam through\nIT Pro TV, it's not ours.\n\n143\n00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,190\nIt's EC
