  "description": "The Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) is a credential that is going to be relevant especially for people who want to focus on the knowledge areas of architectural concepts and design requirements, cloud data security, cloud platform and infrastructure security, cloud application security, and compliance concerns in a traditional standard enterprise environment. As powerful as cloud computing is for the organization, understanding its information security risks and mitigation strategies are critical. Legacy approaches are inadequate, and organizations need competent, experienced professionals equipped with the right cloud security knowledge and skills to be successful. The CCSP certification is for IT professionals with a minimum of five years of cumulative IT experience with backgrounds and exposure to cloud related services.",

on\n\n3\n00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.266\nthe Certified Cloud Security Professional.\n\n4\n00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.969\nNow, and joining me in the studio today to\nhelp us out with that is our good friend,\n\n5\n00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:21.330\nAdam, who will be joining\nus in the series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.840\nAdam, can you give us a quick overview of\n\n7\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.030\nwhat we should expect\nfrom our upcoming series.\n\n8\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.550\n>> Absolutely.\n\n9\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.740\nSo the CCSP is going to be\na credential that is going to be\n\n10\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.620\nrelevant to lots of people\nin the organization, or\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.680\nin a traditional standard\nenterprise organization today.\n\n12\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.350\nBut especially for people that wanna focus\non the following domains and knowledge.\n\n13\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.150\nLet's probably first talk about makes up\nthe CCSP from a knowledge perspective.\n\n14\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.020\nAnd then we'll talk for\n\n15\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020\njust a minute about the relevant\nexperience that somebody may need.\n\n16\n00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.030\nSo we're gonna look at six domains,\nor six areas of knowledge over all.\n\n17\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.200\nWe're going to be talking about\narchitectural concepts and\n\n18\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.120\ndesign requirements.\n\n19\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.580\nSo what does it take to really\nunderstand how to build and\n\n20\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.370\narchitect the cloud both logically and\nphysically?\n\n21\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.730\nCloud data security.\n\n22\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.920\nHow do we secure the data\nthat's in the cloud?\n\n23\n00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.060\nCloud platform and\ninfrastructure security.\n\n24\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.040\nHow do we secure the underlying\ninfrastructure that makes the cloud\n\n25\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.610\npossible?\n\n26\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.860\nThe hosts and the infrastructure that\nwe're going to run the cloud through,\n\n27\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.650\nthe networks, the storage,\nall of that kind of stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.520\nCloud applications security,\nhow do we secure the application so\n\n29\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.860\nthe workloads that run on top\nof the host infrastructure?\n\n30\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.490\nHow do we deal with operational\naspects of the Cloud, so\n\n31\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.330\nwhat does it mean to physically and\nlogically design the Cloud?\n\n32\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.760\nHow do we physically and logically\nimplement cloud infrastructure, and\n\n33\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.982\nhow do we manage it from\na security standpoint?\n\n34\n00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:36.631\nAnd ultimately, of course, no complete\nconversation there at all around those\n\n35\n00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:40.857\nfive things unless we wrap all that with\nthe idea of legal and compliance concerns.\n\n36\n00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:44.287\nHow do we operate effectively in\ndifferent jurisdictional areas?\n\n37\n00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:48.877\nHow as CCSPs are we aware of the rules,\nin other words, we must align with\n\n38\n00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:52.877\nfrom the GRC, a Governance Risk Compliance\nperspective, with regards to the Cloud?\n\n39\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.150\nNow, Adam who is the intended audience for\nthis specific series?\n\n40\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.100\n>> So when we think, hello [LAUGH].\n\n41\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.300\nWhen we think about the intended audience\nfor the cloud, we think about an IT\n\n42\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810\nprofessional first and foremost,\nas we often start out talking about.\n\n43\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.070\nIn this case, an IT professional that\nhas some background, some experience,\n\n44\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.390\nsome exposure to cloud and\ncloud related activities.\n\n45\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.400\nThey may work for a CSP,\na cloud service provider.\n\n46\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.830\nThey may work for an organization that\nwants to go into the cloud business on\n\n47\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150\ntheir own running on prem private\ncloud within the organization.\n\n48\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.550\nIT in other words becomes the cloud\nprovider to the business, but\n\n49\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.030\nit's all done internally.\n\n50\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.040\nWe may work for an organization that\nis pondering a move to the cloud.\n\n51\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.460\nOr we may be a consultant that is going\nto be asked to consult and work for\n\n52\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.260\nvarious organizations that\nare going to be in the cloud\n\n53\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.880\nat various stages of their development and\ntheir use of the cloud.\n\n54\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.580\nIn order to be successful, according to\n(ISC) squared, the CCSP candidate must\n\n55\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.990\nhave a minimum of five years of cumulative\npaid full time IT experience over all,\n\n56\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.140\nwhich most people will be\nable to certainly provide and\n\n57\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.100\nto offer evidence of these days.\n\n58\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.575\nAnd of that five years, three years\nmust be in information security overall,\n\n59\n00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.985\none year or one focal year overall,\n\n60\n00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.815\nin other words one sixth of the,\nI'm sorry not one sixth, one fifth.\n\n61\n00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:09.345\nLet me do the math correctly,\n\n62\n00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:12.830\none fifth of the overall amount of time we\nneed should be in a cloud focused domain.\n\n63\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.067\nSo one of the of the six domains that\ni just mentioned to you, architecture,\n\n64\n00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:23.174\ncompliance, oversight in regards to cloud\nmanagement, operationally, architecture,\n\n65\n00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:26.782\net cetera, have one year of provable\nexperience in one of those domains.\n\n66\n00:03:26.782 --> 00:03:30.322\nAnd then you're able to essentially\nqualify to sit for the exam.\n\n67\n00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:30.842\n>> Awesome.\nWell,\n\n68\n00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:35.082\nyou talk about an exam, obviously there's\na certification that goes along with this.\n\n69\n00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.610\nAdam, can you tell us a little\nbit about that itself?\n\n70\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.070\n>> So the certification itself, like many\nof the exams that (ISC) squared has in\n\n71\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.330\nmarket, all of them these days,\nwill be delivered computerized.\n\n72\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330\nSo you'll be able to go out\nto a testing center and\n\n73\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.650\ntake that exam when you've studied for\nit and are ready.\n\n74\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.765\nThe exam will be timed.\n\n75\n00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:50.880\nYou'll have a certain amount of time.\n\n76\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.830\nThere will be a certain number of\nquestions associated with the exam,\n\n77\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.810\na pretty standard format in that respect.\n\n78\n00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.530\nMultiple choice exam format\nstandardized today, so\n\n79\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.970\nthere may be test questions\nthat will be scenario based.\n\n80\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.485\nThey may be questions that will\nbe traditional multiple choice.\n\n81\n00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:07.625\nThere will be questions that may\nbe mix and match, drag and drop.\n\n82\n00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:11.275\nPretty standard exam format that we're\nused to seeing in multiple vendor\n\n83\n00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:14.095\narenas today with regard to\nhow they will offer testing.\n\n84\n00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:18.147\nThe one thing that's interesting here,\nis that (ISC) squared has partnered with\n\n85\n00:04:18.147 --> 00:04:22.987\nthe CSA, the Cloud Security Alliance,\nwhich is an international trade group\n\n86\n00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:27.267\nthat is formed from some of the big\nvendors in the cloud industry along with\n\n87\n00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.417\na lot of other players in the cloud\nindustry, focused on information security.\n\n88\n00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:34.967\nAnd they are going to be able to,\nbecause of this partnership,\n\n89\n00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.910\naccess the knowledge base the cloud\nsecurity alliance has developed.\n\n90\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.420\nWe'll talk about this in upcoming\nepisodes when you come in and\n\n91\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.150\nstart watching our material.\n\n92\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.140\nBut the interesting part here with regards\nto the exam is that the Cloud Security\n\n93\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.210\nAlliance has their own certification\non the market, the CCSK certificate.\n\n94\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.415\nIf you study for and\n\n95\n00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:55.005\nachieve the CCSK Certificate from the CSA,\nthat actually is able\n\n96\n00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:59.315\nto act as the one year of experience in\nthe cloud that (ISC) squared requires and\n\n97\n00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:02.815\nyou don't have to provide that one year of\ndocumented experience through your resume.\n\n98\n00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:06.865\nYou simply can show that you\nhave that CCSK certification and\n\n99\n00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:08.920\nthen you're able to qualify for\nand sit for the exam.\n\n100\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.055\nI can do that as well.\n\n101\n00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:11.465\n>> Excellent information Adam.\n\n102\n00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:14.020\nWe thank you for\nexplaining these things to us.\n\n103\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.806\nAnd if it sounds like something that might\nbe interesting or necessary for you,\n\n104\n00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:20.476\nwe look forward to seeing you\nin the upcoming episodes.\n\n105\n00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:26.274\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
