  "description": "The Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) is a credential that is going to be relevant especially for people who want to focus on the knowledge areas of architectural concepts and design requirements, cloud data security, cloud platform and infrastructure security, cloud application security, and compliance concerns in a traditional standard enterprise environment. As powerful as cloud computing is for the organization, understanding its information security risks and mitigation strategies are critical. Legacy approaches are inadequate, and organizations need competent, experienced professionals equipped with the right cloud security knowledge and skills to be successful. The CCSP certification is for IT professionals with a minimum of five years of cumulative IT experience with backgrounds and exposure to cloud related services.",

on\n\n3\n00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.266\nthe Certified Cloud Security Professional.\n\n4\n00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.969\nNow, and joining me in the studio today to\nhelp us out with that is our good friend,\n\n5\n00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:21.330\nAdam, who will be joining\nus in the series.\n\n6\n00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.840\nAdam, can you give us a quick overview of\n\n7\n00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.030\nwhat we should expect\nfrom our upcoming series.\n\n8\n00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.550\n>> Absolutely.\n\n9\n00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.740\nSo the CCSP is going to be\na credential that is going to be\n\n10\n00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.620\nrelevant to lots of people\nin the organization, or\n\n11\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.680\nin a traditional standard\nenterprise organization today.\n\n12\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.350\nBut especially for people that wanna focus\non the following domains and knowledge.\n\n13\n00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.150\nLet's probably first talk about makes up\nthe CCSP from a knowledge perspective.\n\n14\n00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.020\nAnd then we'll talk for\n\n15\n00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020\njust a minute about the relevant\nexperience that somebody may need.\n\n16\n00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.030\nSo we're gonna look at six domains,\nor six areas of knowledge over all.\n\n17\n00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.200\nWe're going to be talking about\narchitectural concepts and\n\n18\n00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.120\ndesign requirements.\n\n19\n00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.580\nSo what does it take to really\nunderstand how to build and\n\n20\n00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.370\narchitect the cloud both logically and\nphysically?\n\n21\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.730\nCloud data security.\n\n22\n00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.920\nHow do we secure the data\nthat's in the cloud?\n\n23\n00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.060\nCloud platform and\ninfrastructure security.\n\n24\n00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.040\nHow do we secure the underlying\ninfrastructure that makes the cloud\n\n25\n00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.610\npossible?\n\n26\n00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.860\nThe hosts and the infrastructure that\nwe're going to run the cloud through,\n\n27\n00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.650\nthe networks, the storage,\nall of that kind of stuff.\n\n28\n00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.520\nCloud applications security,\nhow do we secure the application so\n\n29\n00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.860\nthe workloads that run on top\nof the host infrastructure?\n\n30\n00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.490\nHow do we deal with operational\naspects of the Cloud, so\n\n31\n00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.330\nwhat does it mean to physically and\nlogically design the Cloud?\n\n32\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.760\nHow do we physically and logically\nimplement cloud infrastructure, and\n\n33\n00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.982\nhow do we manage it from\na security standpoint?\n\n34\n00:01:32.982 --> 00:01:36.631\nAnd ultimately, of course, no complete\nconversation there at all around those\n\n35\n00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:40.857\nfive things unless we wrap all that with\nthe idea of legal and compliance concerns.\n\n36\n00:01:40.857 --> 00:01:44.287\nHow do we operate effectively in\ndifferent jurisdictional areas?\n\n37\n00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:48.877\nHow as CCSPs are we aware of the rules,\nin other words, we must align with\n\n38\n00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:52.877\nfrom the GRC, a Governance Risk Compliance\nperspective, with regards to the Cloud?\n\n39\n00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.150\nNow, Adam who is the intended audience for\nthis specific series?\n\n40\n00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.100\n>> So when we think, hello [LAUGH].\n\n41\n00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.300\nWhen we think about the intended audience\nfor the cloud, we think about an IT\n\n42\n00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810\nprofessional first and foremost,\nas we often start out talking about.\n\n43\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.070\nIn this case, an IT professional that\nhas some background, some experience,\n\n44\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.390\nsome exposure to cloud and\ncloud related activities.\n\n45\n00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.400\nThey may work for a CSP,\na cloud service provider.\n\n46\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.830\nThey may work for an organization that\nwants to go into the cloud business on\n\n47\n00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150\ntheir own running on prem private\ncloud within the organization.\n\n48\n00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.550\nIT in other words becomes the cloud\nprovider to the business, but\n\n49\n00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.030\nit's all done internally.\n\n50\n00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.040\nWe may work for an organization that\nis pondering a move to the cloud.\n\n51\n00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.460\nOr we may be a consultant that is going\nto be asked to consult and work for\n\n52\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.260\nvarious organizations that\nare going to be in the cloud\n\n53\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.880\nat various stages of their development and\ntheir use of the cloud.\n\n54\n00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.580\nIn order to be successful, according to\n(ISC) squared, the CCSP candidate must\n\n55\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.990\nhave a minimum of five years of cumulative\npaid full time IT experience over all,\n\n56\n00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.140\nwhich most people will be\nable to certainly provide and\n\n57\n00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.100\nto offer evidence of these days.\n\n58\n00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.575\nAnd of that five years, three years\nmust be in information security overall,\n\n59\n00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.985\none year or one focal year overall,\n\n60\n00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:07.815\nin other words one sixth of the,\nI'm sorry not one sixth, one fifth.\n\n61\n00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:09.345\nLet me do the math correctly,\n\n62\n00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:12.830\none fifth of the overall amount of time we\nneed should be in a cloud focused domain.\n\n63\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.067\nSo one of the of the six domains that\ni just mentioned to you, architecture,\n\n64\n00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:23.174\ncompliance, oversight in regards to cloud\nmanagement, operationally, architecture,\n\n65\n00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:26.782\net cetera, have one year of provable\nexperience in one of those domains.\n\n66\n00:03:26.782 --> 00:03:30.322\nAnd then you're able to essentially\nqualify to sit for the exam.\n\n67\n00:03:30.322 --> 00:03:30.842\n>> Awesome.\nWell,\n\n68\n00:03:30.842 --> 00:03:35.082\nyou talk about an exam, obviously there's\na certification that goes along with this.\n\n69\n00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:37.610\nAdam, can you tell us a little\nbit about that itself?\n\n70\n00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.070\n>> So the certification itself, like many\nof the exams that (ISC) squared has in\n\n71\n00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.330\nmarket, all of them these days,\nwill be delivered computerized.\n\n72\n00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330\nSo you'll be able to go out\nto a testing center and\n\n73\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.650\ntake that exam when you've studied for\nit and are ready.\n\n74\n00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.765\nThe exam will be timed.\n\n75\n00:03:49.765 --> 00:03:50.880\nYou'll have a certain amount of time.\n\n76\n00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.830\nThere will be a certain number of\nquestions associated with the exam,\n\n77\n00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.810\na pretty standard format in that respect.\n\n78\n00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.530\nMultiple choice exam format\nstandardized today, so\n\n79\n00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.970\nthere may be test questions\nthat will be scenario based.\n\n80\n00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.485\nThey may be questions that will\nbe traditional multiple choice.\n\n81\n00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:07.625\nThere will be questions that may\nbe mix and match, drag and drop.\n\n82\n00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:11.275\nPretty standard exam format that we're\nused to seeing in multiple vendor\n\n83\n00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:14.095\narenas today with regard to\nhow they will offer testing.\n\n84\n00:04:14.095 --> 00:04:18.147\nThe one thing that's interesting here,\nis that (ISC) squared has partnered with\n\n85\n00:04:18.147 --> 00:04:22.987\nthe CSA, the Cloud Security Alliance,\nwhich is an international trade group\n\n86\n00:04:22.987 --> 00:04:27.267\nthat is formed from some of the big\nvendors in the cloud industry along with\n\n87\n00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:31.417\na lot of other players in the cloud\nindustry, focused on information security.\n\n88\n00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:34.967\nAnd they are going to be able to,\nbecause of this partnership,\n\n89\n00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:37.910\naccess the knowledge base the cloud\nsecurity alliance has developed.\n\n90\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.420\nWe'll talk about this in upcoming\nepisodes when you come in and\n\n91\n00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.150\nstart watching our material.\n\n92\n00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.140\nBut the interesting part here with regards\nto the exam is that the Cloud Security\n\n93\n00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.210\nAlliance has their own certification\non the market, the CCSK certificate.\n\n94\n00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.415\nIf you study for and\n\n95\n00:04:50.415 --> 00:04:55.005\nachieve the CCSK Certificate from the CSA,\nthat actually is able\n\n96\n00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:59.315\nto act as the one year of experience in\nthe cloud that (ISC) squared requires and\n\n97\n00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:02.815\nyou don't have to provide that one year of\ndocumented experience through your resume.\n\n98\n00:05:02.815 --> 00:05:06.865\nYou simply can show that you\nhave that CCSK certification and\n\n99\n00:05:06.865 --> 00:05:08.920\nthen you're able to qualify for\nand sit for the exam.\n\n100\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.055\nI can do that as well.\n\n101\n00:05:10.055 --> 00:05:11.465\n>> Excellent information Adam.\n\n102\n00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:14.020\nWe thank you for\nexplaining these things to us.\n\n103\n00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.806\nAnd if it sounds like something that might\nbe interesting or necessary for you,\n\n104\n00:05:17.806 --> 00:05:20.476\nwe look forward to seeing you\nin the upcoming episodes.\n\n105\n00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:26.274\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

to\nanother great episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:18.970\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode well,\n\n5\n00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.810\nwe are kicking off our certified\ncloud security professional series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.050\nJoining us in the studio today\nto help us climb that mountain,\n\n7\n00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.930\nis our good friend Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.590\nAdam, welcome to the show sir,\nhow's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.140\n>> Thank you good,\nit's good, it's going well.\n\n10\n00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.730\nLooking forward to flying through\nthe cloud stratosphere with you and\n\n11\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.550\nour viewers.\n\n12\n00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.750\nSo we're start out by talking\na little bit about the cloud, but\n\n13\n00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.470\nfrom a very high level perspective,\nno pun intended by the way.\n\n14\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.910\nWe're gonna talk about architectural\nconcepts and, essentially,\n\n15\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.460\ndesign requirements, right?\n\n16\n00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.640\nWhat is important?\n\n17\n00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.390\nWhat do we need to know?\n\n18\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.890\nAnd when we think about those things, what\nare the background knowledge elements?\n\n19\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.931\nThe things that are gonna be real\ncritical to us for our understanding,\n\n20\n00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:58.274\nnot only of the cloud, but all of\nthe feeder elements, the supporting parts,\n\n21\n00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:00.878\nthe infrastructure, if you will,\nthat makes up the cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:00.878 --> 00:01:02.513\nAnd as we, as cloud professionals,\n\n23\n00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:06.263\nultimately wanna be thinking about how to\nbuild cloud infrastructure we really have\n\n24\n00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:08.820\nto start by thinking about\nwhat are the building blocks.\n\n25\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.150\nAnd we're gonna start by laying out,\nDaniel and I, for\n\n26\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.040\nyou over the next few minutes,\nare gonna start by laying out some of\n\n27\n00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.050\nthe definitions, some of the over-arching\nthought processes that help us to link,\n\n28\n00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.080\nand start to think through\nthe concepts of the cloud.\n\n29\n00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.270\nAnd ultimately build a picture of what\nthe cloud looks like from the ground up.\n\n30\n00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.590\nAt least if everything works out the right\nway that's what we're gonna try to do.\n\n31\n00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.748\nSo we'll see how far we get with that.\n\n32\n00:01:27.748 --> 00:01:30.240\nBut we're gonna talk about the roles\n\n33\n00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.530\nthat cloud computing\nprofessionals often inhabit.\n\n34\n00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.050\nWe're gonna talk about the service models\n\n35\n00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.852\nthat cloud is going to\nbe consumed through.\n\n36\n00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:40.050\nWe're gonna talk about the architectural\ndeployment models that cloud can be\n\n37\n00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.080\nused or managed through.\n\n38\n00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.380\nWe're gonna talk about an over-arching\ncloud definition according to NIST.\n\n39\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.943\nWhat are the five key\nelements of cloud computing?\n\n40\n00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:49.909\nThe things that we look at that help\nus to define and measure whether or\n\n41\n00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.718\nnot something is indeed a cloud service.\n\n42\n00:01:51.718 --> 00:01:54.620\nSo we're gonna spend a lot of\ntime building background and\n\n43\n00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.712\nfunctional knowledge.\n\n44\n00:01:55.712 --> 00:01:58.940\nIt's gonna be very important for\nus both as we start to then,\n\n45\n00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.910\nmove into later discussions about\nhow we manage, how we optimize,\n\n46\n00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.660\nhow we secure, how we monitor the cloud.\n\n47\n00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.100\nBut also to understand how to prepare,\nultimately,\n\n48\n00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.360\nto become successful as the CCSP, take and\nmaster the knowledge, and, ultimately,\n\n49\n00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.840\ntake and master the material on the exam\nif that's where you wanna be as an IC2,\n\n50\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.950\ncloud security professional.\n\n51\n00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.650\nSo we're gonna go through that\nmaterial little by little here.\n\n52\n00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.520\nWe're gonna to talk about cloud competing\nconcepts, cloud reference architectures.\n\n53\n00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.390\nWe'll take a look at\nthe Cloud Security Alliance website.\n\n54\n00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.003\nTalk about the information there, very\nimportant for us to understand where our\n\n55\n00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:33.619\nbackground reference points are,\nwhere they come from.\n\n56\n00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:37.747\nYou know, as we talk about the cloud, and\nwe think about the journey into the cloud,\n\n57\n00:02:37.747 --> 00:02:40.980\nand we often hear people\ntalk about it this way.\n\n58\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.360\nI often think, and Daniel, I don't\nknow if this makes sense for you, but\n\n59\n00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.290\nI often think about the fact that,\n\n60\n00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.670\nstarting the journey into the cloud is\nmuch like looking at The Wizard of Oz.\n\n61\n00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.720\nAnd I like a lot of movies.\n\n62\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.710\nIf you've seen some of\nthe prior shows I've done,\n\n63\n00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.510\nyou often hear me refer to movies\nby way of explaining concepts.\n\n64\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.280\nAnd before we got started, Daniel and I\nwere talking this morning about movies and\n\n65\n00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.350\nour kinda joint love of movie references.\n\n66\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.540\nSo first one for you today, right.\n\n67\n00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.240\nSo, the Wizard of Oz, right,\nclassic picture [COUGH].\n\n68\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.350\nYou've got black and\nwhite cinematography for\n\n69\n00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.950\nthe first half of the movie, when we're\nin Kansas and everything's happening.\n\n70\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.060\nDorothy goes through the storm,\nwinds up coming out of the cyclone,\n\n71\n00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.130\nright out of the tornado, drops down\non the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\n72\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.260\nAnd she opens up the door, right, walks\nout of the house and Technicolor, right?\n\n73\n00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.780\nEverything is beautiful,\neverything is sharp, everything is vivid,\n\n74\n00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.010\neverything is in focus and\n\n75\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.910\nthe rest of the movie is essentially\nColor cinematography all the way through.\n\n76\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.660\nAnd she does the whole,\nwelcome to Munchkinville thing, right.\n\n77\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.160\nShe meets all the denizens of the city, or\n\n78\n00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.000\nthe village cuz it really\nis more like a village.\n\n79\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.290\nAnd she gets danced around, winds up\nin the middle of the town square, and\n\n80\n00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.540\nthey talk about, you'll follow\nthe yellow brick road, right.\n\n81\n00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.040\nThis is kinda the theme of\nthis part of the movie.\n\n82\n00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.510\nHow are you gonna get to the Emerald City?\n\n83\n00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.340\nHow do you get to Oz?\n\n84\n00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.620\nHow do you meet the Wizard?\n\n85\n00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.320\nYou ultimately follow\nthe yellow brick road.\n\n86\n00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.295\nAnd when we think about the yellow brick\nroad, it starts out essentially as this,\n\n87\n00:03:56.295 --> 00:03:58.540\n[COUGH], little point in\nthe middle of the square.\n\n88\n00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.560\nAnd it cycles or cyclically wraps around\nuntil it becomes this broad avenue,\n\n89\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.980\nright, this street that kind of is\nyellow paved and out in the distance.\n\n90\n00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.610\nWhen you look at it now, you realize it's\na backdrop, it's not really anything.\n\n91\n00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.920\nBut in the day it looked\nlike the Emerald City.\n\n92\n00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.530\nAnd it looked like, okay,\nthat's where Dorothy's going.\n\n93\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.610\nShe's gonna shoot down the road, and\nshe's gonna have this adventure.\n\n94\n00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.250\nAnd she meets the Scarecrow, and the Lion,\nand the Tin Man, and everything else.\n\n95\n00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.200\nThe flying monkeys always cool, right?\n\n96\n00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.861\n>> That's always fun.\n\n97\n00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:24.994\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's always cool, right?\n\n98\n00:04:24.994 --> 00:04:26.730\nSo flying monkeys always make for\na great movie.\n\n99\n00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.480\n>> So she does this when she\ngoes through this journey.\n\n100\n00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.330\nI often use this knowledge when I\ntalk about cloud with customers\n\n101\n00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.550\nbecause it really is\nbasically the same idea.\n\n102\n00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.540\nWe're starting a journey and\nwe have to be prepared for the journey.\n\n103\n00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.980\nWe have to understand what the\nrequirements are, but most importantly,\n\n104\n00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.580\nwe have to understand where we are in\norder to understand where we wanna go.\n\n105\n00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.730\nAnd the idea of being in a very\nwell-defined, well-understood place,\n\n106\n00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.140\nessentially our starting point, the\nbeginning of the yellow brick road, right?\n\n107\n00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.310\nWhere we start out, it's clearly defined.\n\n108\n00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.012\nIt begins as a small point, and\nwe can then imagine and see our way,\n\n109\n00:05:00.012 --> 00:05:02.744\nworking down towards where we wanna be,\nright.\n\n110\n00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:06.677\nIn the distance, whatever that end\npoint is, a private cloud deployment,\n\n111\n00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:10.390\na public cloud deployment, an IASS,\na PASS, or a SaaS solution.\n\n112\n00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.730\nWhatever it may be,\nwe're gonna see that, and\n\n113\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.070\nwe're gonna work towards that\nincrementally in stages.\n\n114\n00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.680\nAnd this is the idea and the beginning of\nunderstanding what reference architecture\n\n115\n00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.300\nand cloud computing concepts is all about.\n\n116\n00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.500\nBecause they help us to define,\nultimately, what our journey is gonna be.\n\n117\n00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.850\nWhen we think about how to accomplish\nsomething, right, that's complicated.\n\n118\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.440\nAnd cloud is complicated, right?\n\n119\n00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.300\nLet's be honest, let's be clear, let's\nset the appropriate context up front.\n\n120\n00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.310\nIt's not a do-it-yourself kind of\nthing where you pop it out of the box.\n\n121\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.200\nAnd you apply a couple of changes to your\nenvironment, and boom, you have a cloud.\n\n122\n00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.610\nI mean, in theory, it could be.\n\n123\n00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.140\nIt's not overly complex in certain cases.\n\n124\n00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.910\nBut the reality is,\n\n125\n00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.460\nto do cloud the right way, we need a lot\nof complexity that we have to master.\n\n126\n00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.800\nWe need policy, we need procedure.\n\n127\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.470\nWe need risk management, we need auditing.\n\n128\n00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.730\nWe need continuous monitoring.\n\n129\n00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.050\nWe need to have a deployment model and\n\n130\n00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.990\na service model that matches our\nexpectations of consumption.\n\n131\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.680\nIt's gotta be highly skilled,\nor what we call elastic.\n\n132\n00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.660\nIt's gotta be available on demand,\nwhat was call ubiquitousness.\n\n133\n00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.670\nIt's gotta be everywhere all the time.\n\n134\n00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.490\nThis takes a lot of resources,\na lot of thought, a lot of planning, and\n\n135\n00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.670\na lot of starting and\nstopping to get it right.\n\n136\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.800\nAnd what a lot of of my\ncustomers do the wrong way,\n\n137\n00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.360\ninitially, when they go into the cloud,\nis that they miss three key or\n\n138\n00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.890\nvital things that they have\nto figure out how to do.\n\n139\n00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.443\nThey gotta know where they are,\nas we were just talking about.\n\n140\n00:06:30.443 --> 00:06:32.870\nSo they have to have a well\ndefined starting point.\n\n141\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.040\nSo they have to know the a-is,\nreally understand current state.\n\n142\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.480\nThey have to define where they want to be,\nultimately, define the to-be, right,\n\n143\n00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.450\nthe future state,\nwhere we would like to go over time.\n\n144\n00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.100\nAnd then, as simple as this sounds but\nas complicated as it becomes,\n\n145\n00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.570\nthey have to understand the incremental\napproach to walk-through.\n\n146\n00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:52.245\nMoving from where we are to where\nwe want to be in a risk-adverse and\n\n147\n00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.910\na well-managed way.\n\n148\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.210\nAnd this is what many customers miss,\nmany security professionals,\n\n149\n00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.830\nmany cloud professionals.\n\n150\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.220\nWe'll put that word in quotes,\nright, cloud professionals.\n\n151\n00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.480\nBecause, what it means to be a cloud\nprofessional today can mean a lot of\n\n152\n00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.010\ndifferent things to you, depending on\nwhat your business requirements are.\n\n153\n00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.570\nYou may be a cloud professional that\nworks on a very specific platform.\n\n154\n00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:18.480\nAmazon, AWS for instance or Microsoft's\nOffice 365 and the Azure Fabric.\n\n155\n00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.050\nOr you may be on VMware's vCloud and\nvCloud Air infrastructure and\n\n156\n00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.070\nthings of that nature, or a combination.\n\n157\n00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.490\nOr you may be doing cloud, but\nit may be private internal cloud,\n\n158\n00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.950\ninside the organization,\nwhat we call on-prem internal cloud.\n\n159\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.320\nAs an IT provider, while you provide\ncloud services to the business, you do so\n\n160\n00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.990\nin essentially a firewalled off,\n\n161\n00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.800\nisolated way, that never really\nis exposed to the outside world.\n\n162\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.610\nYou may do private cloud through a hosted\nenvironment, outside the organization.\n\n163\n00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.249\nEssentially, through one of these\nproviders we just talked about.\n\n164\n00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:52.951\nDedicated infrastructure, but essentially\ndedicated to your organization.\n\n165\n00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:57.076\nYou may use a hybrid cloud, a public,\nprivate, or a Public community, or\n\n166\n00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:59.514\na community hybrid, or whatever it is mix.\n\n167\n00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:02.430\nAnd you'll see these different models,\nwe'll talk about them.\n\n168\n00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.670\nBut really understanding where we are,\nlooking around us, right?\n\n169\n00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.425\nTurning around and see all the things\nthat are everywhere we go, right?\n\n170\n00:08:09.425 --> 00:08:11.735\nAnd notice as I turn,\nthe camera doesn't turn with me.\n\n171\n00:08:11.735 --> 00:08:14.675\nSo you see my face when I go this way or\nthat way.\n\n172\n00:08:14.675 --> 00:08:18.335\nBut when we turn around and\nwe see the panoramic 360 view\n\n173\n00:08:18.335 --> 00:08:22.445\nof where we are as a security\nprofessional, as a cloud architect,\n\n174\n00:08:22.445 --> 00:08:27.670\nas a cloud service provider or\nCSP and all these roles we'll define.\n\n175\n00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.760\nWe have to understand that every role\nhas a different perspective, and\n\n176\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.570\nevery role is gonna bring something\nto the conversation, right?\n\n177\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.380\nYou and I Daniel we're talking a little\nbit before we got started this morning\n\n178\n00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.580\nabout your time outside this organization,\nright what you did before you came\n\n179\n00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.900\nto ITProTV, working as a sys admin,\nworking for\n\n180\n00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.460\nmany years right in IT but maybe not\nspecifically working with cloud, right?\n\n181\n00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.230\nAt least not at the time, anyway.\n\n182\n00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.800\nAnd when you think about cloud and\nyou think about the different things that\n\n183\n00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.740\nyou're gonna do as an IT administrator,\nyou'll find, and I think this is probably\n\n184\n00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.510\nsomething you're aware of, because we\ntalked about it a little bit this morning,\n\n185\n00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.940\nwith things like auditing, when you and\nI were chatting about auditing.\n\n186\n00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.060\nThe fact that a lot of what we talk about\nfrom IT generically Is very similar\n\n187\n00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:11.120\nto what we talked about with the cloud but\nthe differences are that we tend to,\n\n188\n00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.720\nnumber one,\nput the word cloud in front of it.\n\n189\n00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.220\nSo instead of a risk audit,\n\n190\n00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.170\nit's a cloud risk audit, instead of\na deployment, it's a cloud deployment.\n\n191\n00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.560\nIt's identical in many respects but\nwe simply tag it or\n\n192\n00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.190\nname it with the cloud in order to\nsignify and to differentiate for\n\n193\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.320\nthose around us that were working\nin a very specific environment.\n\n194\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.060\n>> So you'd say that a lot of the concepts\nwe're going to cover today is, if you've\n\n195\n00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.620\nbeen in IT for a little while, they're\nnot gonna be completely foreign to us,\n\n196\n00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:39.550\nthey're just gonna me more cloud\noriented than what we're used to.\n\n197\n00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:44.900\n>> Right, so they're gonna be, I like\ncloud oriented, let's say cloud aligned.\n\n198\n00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.800\nLet's think of it that way, because\nwhen we think of cloud alignment, and\n\n199\n00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.112\nthis will be a theme we come back\nto throughout our conversations.\n\n200\n00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:55.320\nWe're gonna see that almost exactly what\nyou describe that a lot of what we do is\n\n201\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:01.070\nvery similar, but there are cloud\nspecifics or cloud specificity\n\n202\n00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.930\nwe overlay to ensure that we're aligned\nwith the direction to the cloud.\n\n203\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.430\n>> I think it's funny you used the term\nand you did the air quotes, I love that.\n\n204\n00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.260\nThat we're cloud professionals,\n\n205\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.830\nwhen really a lot of us are like\nmyself I would say I'm nor\n\n206\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.740\nof a professional that works in the cloud,\nand I want to become a cloud professional.\n\n207\n00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.040\nWhich, I hope you can see\nthe different between the two.\n\n208\n00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.690\n>> It is important,\n\n209\n00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.580\nit's an important point because\nthe cloud is a concept, right?\n\n210\n00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.200\nAs a marketing concept,\n\n211\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.540\nlet's kind of put it out there and\ntalk about it for what it is.\n\n212\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.680\nYou have a cloud concept just like\nthe internet of things, like convergence,\n\n213\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.480\nthese are terms that somebody\nsomewhere in the marketing arm of\n\n214\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.250\na business may use to describe services\nand innovative approaches that\n\n215\n00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.460\na business essentially is gonna try to\nsell to customers more often than not.\n\n216\n00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.420\nAnd this is a term or\n\n217\n00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.090\nthese sets of terms are terms that the IT\nindustry overall and certain security\n\n218\n00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.210\nfocused areas of IT have really come\nto use to describe service models.\n\n219\n00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:01.950\nThey are legitimate.\n\n220\n00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.230\nThese terms definitely exist.\n\n221\n00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.770\nWe can define them formally\nwe can understand them we can\n\n222\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:12.160\nrigorously apply the specifics of these\ndefinitions to the way in which we manage.\n\n223\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.840\nBut it's also a very misunderstood and\n\n224\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.790\nvery ill defined concept out beyond\nthe border of that conversation.\n\n225\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:21.120\nAnd a very small group of professionals\nthat really understand and\n\n226\n00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.380\nlisten to it every day.\n\n227\n00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.460\nWhen you talk to average people on\nthe street, you talk to consumers of cloud\n\n228\n00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.760\nservices, which probably everybody\nlistening to this show either live,\n\n229\n00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.080\nor ultimately through the recording will\nbe, because we all use smart devices,\n\n230\n00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.910\nmost of us do anyway on\na regular basis today.\n\n231\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.200\nMost, if not all of us, consume one or\nmore cloud services regularly.\n\n232\n00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:45.370\nWhether we do it for work do it for our\nprivate use as a consumer outside of work\n\n233\n00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:50.530\nor both and the reality is we live our\nlives interacting with the cloud in so\n\n234\n00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.372\nmany ways today that we often don't\nthink about think about it right.\n\n235\n00:11:53.372 --> 00:11:56.150\nRight, you and I were just talking before\nwe started about the things we don't think\n\n236\n00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.910\nabout until something happens and we have\nto really consider how we do them, and\n\n237\n00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.910\nit's what I'll call the thumb analogy\nbecause that's what we were talking about\n\n238\n00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.010\nbecause it sounds better\nthan the toe analogy.\n\n239\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.780\nSo the thumb analogy is what we were\ntalking about off camera before we got\n\n240\n00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.350\nstarted this morning which\nis essentially how often\n\n241\n00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.730\nyou have to use something like your thumb\njust to do common things without really\n\n242\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.840\nthinking about how often you do it.\n\n243\n00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:20.310\nAnd it becomes so second nature to\nyou you don't really even see it,\n\n244\n00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:21.780\nyou don't think about it,\nit doesn't register.\n\n245\n00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.700\nIt just becomes part of the background\nnoise, until you're forced to\n\n246\n00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.570\nconfront the fact that, you know maybe\nyour thumb's not working the right way,\n\n247\n00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.210\nbecause I have a boo-boo on my thumb and\nI was hurt, so\n\n248\n00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:33.960\nI was talking about how my boo-boo is\nnot allowing me to do certain things.\n\n249\n00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.120\nAnd so as a result, yet we often take for\ngranted a lot of the things we do.\n\n250\n00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.050\nAnd we find, at least I find,\n\n251\n00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.030\nthat my conversations with my customers,\nwith my students, that when we start these\n\n252\n00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:48.210\nconversations about the cloud I'll ask\nthem so what does the cloud mean to you?\n\n253\n00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.180\nHow do you define the cloud?\n\n254\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.930\nWhat is your interpretation?\n\n255\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.520\nWhat's your vision if\nyou will of the cloud?\n\n256\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.400\nWhy are we here?\n\n257\n00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.350\nWhy are we discussing this?\n\n258\n00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.010\nWhy is it important to your business?\n\n259\n00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.430\nAnd I'll hear all these great things, but\n\n260\n00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.740\nI'll hear things that\nare all over the map.\n\n261\n00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.490\nAnd a lot of the times while they're\ncloud aware and they're probably in\n\n262\n00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:08.570\nthe general thought process of cloud,\nthey're not cloud specific.\n\n263\n00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:11.780\nThey're not aligned with the cloud and\nreally defined that way.\n\n264\n00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.530\nWe want to use the cloud to\ndo continuous monitoring and\n\n265\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:20.020\nto do SIEM related solutions, right\nsecurity information event management.\n\n266\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.450\nWant to pull that data out of a bunch\nof our servers, through the cloud, and\n\n267\n00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.570\ndo data analytics, data visualization,\nKPIs and BI through the cloud.\n\n268\n00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.050\nAnd hook that up to SharePoint or\nwhatever we want to do.\n\n269\n00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.230\nGreat, that's a cloud aligned solution,\nbut we could do that with or\n\n270\n00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.980\nwithout the cloud.\n\n271\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.857\nSo the question is,\nwhat is the cloud as unique provider?\n\n272\n00:13:38.857 --> 00:13:42.878\nA unique element in this mix going to give\nyou Mr. and Ms. Customer, Mr. and Mrs.\n\n273\n00:13:42.878 --> 00:13:43.720\nStudent.\n\n274\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.620\nWhat's the uniqueness in other\nwords that you're looking for?\n\n275\n00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.200\nBecause I can show you how to do that\nwithout linking that to the cloud.\n\n276\n00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.420\nBut then they'll say, how do you do that?\n\n277\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.980\nWell, we can go over and\nconnect to SharePoint, right?\n\n278\n00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.570\nAnd we can do that on\na private internal network.\n\n279\n00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:01.540\nWe used to call that an intranet.\n\n280\n00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.320\nAnd an intranet is\nessentially a private cloud.\n\n281\n00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.995\nIt's just that somebody re-branded\nthe concept of an intranet into\n\n282\n00:14:06.995 --> 00:14:10.355\nthis new idea of the cloud, and\nput it out there and kind of marketed it,\n\n283\n00:14:10.355 --> 00:14:12.455\nand so now we talk about private clouds.\n\n284\n00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:15.945\nWe could talk about a public cloud,\nthat would be essentially the Internet,\n\n285\n00:14:15.945 --> 00:14:18.575\nthe largest public network\nwe have in the world today.\n\n286\n00:14:18.575 --> 00:14:21.412\nWorld wide web, Internet,\nwhatever your preference is.\n\n287\n00:14:21.412 --> 00:14:25.222\nDepends on how gray you happen to be\nwhen you talk about the concept, right?\n\n288\n00:14:25.222 --> 00:14:30.032\nBut the reality is, one or both of those\nworld wide networks, graphical orientated\n\n289\n00:14:30.032 --> 00:14:33.602\nor non-graphical, the older version\nof the World Wide Web is essential,\n\n290\n00:14:33.602 --> 00:14:35.202\nwe think of as the Internet, right?\n\n291\n00:14:35.202 --> 00:14:39.640\nBoth of them are really nothing\nmore than public clouds, single,\n\n292\n00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.080\nvery very large public clouds.\n\n293\n00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.420\nWhen we think about a hybrid,\nwe think about joining them together and\n\n294\n00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.340\nessentially having elements of both.\n\n295\n00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.090\nWe've had these ideas,\nthese concepts, for some time.\n\n296\n00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.840\nIn cases decades.\n\n297\n00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.530\nThe concept of an intranet\ngoes back to the 1990s.\n\n298\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.690\nYou're talking about, at this point,\nclose to two decades worth of time\n\n299\n00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.460\nthat we've spent managing, understanding\nand interacting with this technology.\n\n300\n00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.120\nBut not necessarily referring\nto it as a private cloud.\n\n301\n00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.250\nAnd so when we rebrand that technology,\n\n302\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:11.320\npull it forward, add the capabilities to\nit that essentially make it the cloud.\n\n303\n00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.640\nThat's when we really talk about a lining.\n\n304\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.620\nThat's when we really talk about\nunderstanding what the cloud is.\n\n305\n00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.149\nCan we go to the NIST 500-145 document?\n\n306\n00:15:20.149 --> 00:15:22.300\nThat would be the first of the two PDFs.\n\n307\n00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.610\nCan we look at Daniel's screen for\n\n308\n00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.160\njust a second as soon as he\nhas it up there, perfect.\n\n309\n00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.030\nIf we can go and\nscroll down just a little bit.\n\n310\n00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:33.180\nAnd a little bit down below that because\nthat's all purpose and audience.\n\n311\n00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.680\nAnd stop right there,\ngo back up just a little bit.\n\n312\n00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.350\nAnd so right there,\nif we can zoom in on the top\n\n313\n00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.580\nabove the essential characteristics and\njust zoom in on that first paragraph.\n\n314\n00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.580\nYou can zoom in a little bit.\n\n315\n00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.210\nI just want to make sure\nwe can see the definition.\n\n316\n00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.630\nI know it may be hard, we may have\nto move it yeah, just a little bit.\n\n317\n00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.909\nAnd that's fine, I think we could\nprobably just about catch that.\n\n318\n00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:54.216\nYou got to go off I think just\na little bit further over.\n\n319\n00:15:54.216 --> 00:15:55.557\nThere we go, perfect, that looks good.\n\n320\n00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:59.396\nSo when you look at that, what you will\nfind that first paragraph Right below then\n\n321\n00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:01.494\nthis definition of cloud computing right.\n\n322\n00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:05.298\nYou're gonna see the cloud computing\nessentially defined there in several\n\n323\n00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:05.960\nsentences.\n\n324\n00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.535\nAnd it says cloud computing is a model,\nright, for enabling ubiquitous, convenient\n\n325\n00:16:10.535 --> 00:16:15.900\non-demand network access to a shared pool\nof configurable computing resources.\n\n326\n00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.370\nThings like networks, servers,\n\n327\n00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.270\nright whatever they may be,\nthis whole example of things there.\n\n328\n00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.600\nAnd then from there,\nthese can be rapidly provisioned and\n\n329\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:28.130\nreleased with minimal management, effort,\nand or service provider interaction.\n\n330\n00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.000\nEssentially they almost\ntake care of themselves.\n\n331\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.282\nAnd we'll talk about this idea of software\ndefining and automation and why this is so\n\n332\n00:16:34.282 --> 00:16:37.129\ncentral and important to\nthe cloud today as an enabler.\n\n333\n00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:39.300\nAlong with the idea of virtualization and\n\n334\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.090\nthe idea that that platform\nas a technology really has\n\n335\n00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:46.120\nlaunched the cloud into the spotlight\nthat we think of it inhabiting today and\n\n336\n00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.920\nmade it globally the platform that we\ngrow all of our modern services on.\n\n337\n00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.600\nIf you think about doing anything today,\nand you do any of those things in\n\n338\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.510\na meaningful way, it will be very hard for\nyou to figure out how to do them\n\n339\n00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:02.230\nwithout connecting them at some point to\na cloud somewhere in order to access them.\n\n340\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:05.460\nEven if they're totally isolated\nwithin your organization.\n\n341\n00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.020\nAnd there are some exceptions\nto these rules obviously, but\n\n342\n00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:10.120\ngenerically, elements of the cloud and\n\n343\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.010\nvirtualization inhabit almost every\narea of our infrastructure today.\n\n344\n00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.410\nIt's very interesting kind of the change\nin that thought process we've seen just\n\n345\n00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.320\nthe last several years.\n\n346\n00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:20.660\nWe actual need that back cuz we're\nnot done talking about that.\n\n347\n00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.290\nThank you.\n\n348\n00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:24.150\nThis cloud model is at the bottom,\ncomposed of five essential\n\n349\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.862\ncharacteristics, three service models,\nand four deployment models.\n\n350\n00:17:27.862 --> 00:17:31.790\nWe're gonna go through all of these, the\nessential characteristics are down below.\n\n351\n00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:33.820\nWe'll take a look at them\nin just a moment, but\n\n352\n00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.175\nfrom the perspective of\nstarting out our conversation.\n\n353\n00:17:37.175 --> 00:17:41.990\nA CCSP ultimately is somebody\nthat is a cloud certified\n\n354\n00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:45.850\nsecurity professional who understands\ncloud, understands how to manage it,\n\n355\n00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:50.240\nhow to maintain it, how to assess risk and\nultimately deal with vulnerabilities and\n\n356\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.730\nthreats and\nto secure cloud infrastructure.\n\n357\n00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.920\nYou must start at\nthe beginning of this journey.\n\n358\n00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.080\nYou must understand in this document,\nthe NIST SP800 145 Cloud overview, and\n\n359\n00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.630\nthe parent document of this\nthe NIST 800 146 document.\n\n360\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.840\nWe don't have to go to that right now, but\n\n361\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.212\nI know you have it up and\nwe'll show it at some point.\n\n362\n00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:10.850\nWhich is, I think I referred\nto it as the big brother of\n\n363\n00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.210\nthis document when we talked right?\n\n364\n00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:17.070\nWhich is about a 90 page document that\ngoes into much more detail on this 3 or\n\n365\n00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.680\n4 page summary that we're gonna see,\njust in this overview document.\n\n366\n00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.031\nYou're gonna have five essential\ncharacteristics that define the cloud, and\n\n367\n00:18:24.031 --> 00:18:25.890\nwe're gonna go through what they are here.\n\n368\n00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.682\nYou're gonna have ultimately three\nservice models, IAS, PASS and SASS and\n\n369\n00:18:29.682 --> 00:18:31.660\nwe'll talk about what they are.\n\n370\n00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.890\nThose, by the way are the accepted,\nwell-defined, agreed upon service models.\n\n371\n00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.960\nThere are literally hundreds of\nfill in the blank as a service\n\n372\n00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.060\nmodels that we can go to and talk about.\n\n373\n00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.710\nDR as a service, security as a service,\ndatabase as a service,\n\n374\n00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.450\ndesktop as a service,\nthe list goes on, and on, and on.\n\n375\n00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.310\nAnd while they're all valid,\nwhile they're all important, and\n\n376\n00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:56.650\nwhile you can in theory consume\nthem from one or more vendors or\n\n377\n00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.270\nyou can make them up and\nmanage them yourself, or whatever you do.\n\n378\n00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.710\nThey're not universally accepted,\n\n379\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.420\ndefined and understood to mean\nx plus y equals z or whatever.\n\n380\n00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.000\nSorry.\nWhatever that may be as\n\n381\n00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.570\nI-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n382\n00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.990\n>> Smack into the laptop to my right.\n\n383\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.980\nAnd so, as a result, what we're gonna\ndo is focus on the three that everybody\n\n384\n00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.060\nagrees on and\nwe're gonna start from there.\n\n385\n00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:21.570\nAnd then you down the road in\nthe real world fill in the blanks for\n\n386\n00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.270\nwhatever a vendor offers you.\n\n387\n00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:26.160\nSo three service models and\nfour deployment models, right?\n\n388\n00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.200\nI mentioned a few of them already,\n\n389\n00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.820\nI think I mentioned three out of the four,\nI may have even mentioned all four.\n\n390\n00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.170\nPrivate, public, hybrid, and\nthe one that most people don't realize or\n\n391\n00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.840\nknow about community cloud,\nand we'll talk about those.\n\n392\n00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:40.880\nBut you're gonna have to know every\none of these items in these categories\n\n393\n00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.740\nto take and\nsuccessfully pass the CCSP exam.\n\n394\n00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.310\nThis is base foundational bedrock\nknowledge that we expect you will have.\n\n395\n00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.691\nAnd so you're gonna want to\ntake a look at this document.\n\n396\n00:19:49.691 --> 00:19:52.301\nI know we always do a good job\nof throwing up the URLs and\n\n397\n00:19:52.301 --> 00:19:56.370\nmaking sure those references are available\nat the end of the show in the show notes.\n\n398\n00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.100\nSo you'll be able to go out and find this.\n\n399\n00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.880\nBut you definitely should read this\ndocument, read it cover to cover,\n\n400\n00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:04.570\nit's all of seven pages by the time\nyou strip off the introductory stuff.\n\n401\n00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.850\nAnd it's very,\nvery important fundamentally for\n\n402\n00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:08.050\nyour ability to be successful.\n\n403\n00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:09.320\nSo we're gonna take a look at these.\n\n404\n00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.390\nSince we're here let's actually just go\nthrough these central characteristics if\n\n405\n00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.080\nwe could just scroll down just a little.\n\n406\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.980\nI think I'm hiding half of them right now.\n\n407\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.340\nAnd we could talk about\non-demand self-service.\n\n408\n00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.000\nAnd I'll leave it up to you to\nfill in the gaps specifically with\n\n409\n00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.550\nall the words of the definition.\n\n410\n00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.208\nI'm just gonna essentially roll\nthem up and highlight them for you.\n\n411\n00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:28.930\nBut on-demand self-service\nimplies that clouds\n\n412\n00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.100\nare going to be available all the time.\n\n413\n00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.950\nI think I used the word ubiquitous and a\nfew minutes ago we were talking about it.\n\n414\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:39.015\nAlways available and\nyou can consume them, if not immediately,\n\n415\n00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:41.690\nthen almost immediately with very\nsmall delay, just to provision or\n\n416\n00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.988\nto contract and essentially set up access.\n\n417\n00:20:43.988 --> 00:20:48.300\nSo, on-demand self-service allows\nus to unilaterally go in and\n\n418\n00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.340\nprovision computing capabilities.\n\n419\n00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.720\nWe can go in as the customer and\nscale up our needs and\n\n420\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.270\ntherefore scale up our infrastructure by\nworking with the cloud service provider,\n\n421\n00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.050\nwhat we call the CSP traditionally.\n\n422\n00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.810\nWe have broad network access.\n\n423\n00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.070\nThe idea that the cloud should\nbe available from anywhere and\n\n424\n00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:09.830\nshould be consumable by both customers and\nby managers and administrators,\n\n425\n00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:11.130\nsecurity professionals.\n\n426\n00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.700\nAnd should be available to those people,\n\n427\n00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.800\nprovided they're authenticated of course,\nright?\n\n428\n00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.040\nWe have to always keep\nin mind risk management,\n\n429\n00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.580\nalways keep in mind role-based access\ncontrol, making sure we have identity and\n\n430\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.160\naccess management,\nall the bells and whistles.\n\n431\n00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.840\nAll the things that as security\nprofessionals, we hopefully know,\n\n432\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.200\nthat are important to us, and\nthat we want to make sure we're aware of.\n\n433\n00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.010\nSo when I think of broad network access,\nright Daniel?\n\n434\n00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.320\nI think often of being able to sit.\n\n435\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.460\nOne of my favorite places that I\noften talk about is Starbucks,\n\n436\n00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.260\ncuz I do a lot of work remotely,\nI'm not in the office very often.\n\n437\n00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.630\nAnd I tend to be working, either at\na customer site as a consultant or\n\n438\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:47.820\nin a classroom with customers\nsomewhere on site teaching them.\n\n439\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.800\nAnd so I'm in the field a great deal, and\nI travel a great deal for my work, and so\n\n440\n00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.490\nas a result I spend a lot\nof time in strange places.\n\n441\n00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:58.120\nAnd one of the few standards that I can\nrely on is typically finding a Starbucks\n\n442\n00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.750\nto get coffee, but also because they have\nwireless and I can usually get online and\n\n443\n00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:03.820\ndo what I need to do.\n\n444\n00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.570\nSo, from my perspective,\nwhen I access the cloud and\n\n445\n00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:10.756\nI have to check in on Office 365, and\nI have to use email, for instance, right?\n\n446\n00:22:10.756 --> 00:22:14.568\nCuz I use essentially what we would\ngenerically call Outlook Web Access, or\n\n447\n00:22:14.568 --> 00:22:17.860\nat least for years,\nwe've called OWA in one form or another.\n\n448\n00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.540\nI haven't used a mapping client,\na full featured fat desktop client Outlook\n\n449\n00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.630\ninstalled on a PC in probably\nten years at least if not more.\n\n450\n00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:29.180\nI've essentially just\naccessed email over the web,\n\n451\n00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:31.730\nprobably going back\ncloser to 15 years now,\n\n452\n00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:37.240\nback to some of the earliest versions of\nOWA with the early platforms on exchange.\n\n453\n00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.900\nFive five and things like that.\n\n454\n00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.282\n>> It's your AOL account, be honest.\n\n455\n00:22:40.282 --> 00:22:41.650\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Right exactly.\n\n456\n00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.662\nActually MindSpring,\nyou wanna go back even further.\n\n457\n00:22:43.662 --> 00:22:44.640\n>> Wow. [LAUGH] >> MindSpring,\n\n458\n00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.590\nI was on MindSpring before MindSpring\nbecame one of those companies that\n\n459\n00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.340\ndisappeared like AOL kind of has\ndone under the Time Warner merger.\n\n460\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.980\nBut ultimately, I started out the internet\non dial up on MindSpring years ago.\n\n461\n00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.390\nSo when I think of the cloud I think of\nbeing able to get to my email account,\n\n462\n00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:03.010\nbecause for me that's one of the most\nimportant things I do in the cloud.\n\n463\n00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:04.070\nI do a lot of other stuff.\n\n464\n00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.470\nI remotely manage infrastructure for\ncustomers, I do a lot of assessment and\n\n465\n00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.920\naudit work for customers.\n\n466\n00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:11.370\nSo I'm in the cloud a great deal.\n\n467\n00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:14.750\nBut everything is predicated on my ability\nto be able to have network access.\n\n468\n00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.640\nNot so much on-demand self-service cuz I'm\nnot always provisioning infrastructure\n\n469\n00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.650\nthat is important for me.\n\n470\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.110\nBut of the things on that list, broad\nnetwork access is the most compelling for\n\n471\n00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:26.980\nme because I have to be able to\nget to my cloud wherever I am,\n\n472\n00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.190\nand that's really important, right?\n\n473\n00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.720\nResource pooling, the idea of\nbeing able to essentially provide\n\n474\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.290\nresources in ways that become aggregated.\n\n475\n00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:39.492\nThey become additive and I can add on,\nand as a result of that get the value of\n\n476\n00:23:39.492 --> 00:23:43.189\nthe cloud service provider's\ninvestment and infrastructure.\n\n477\n00:23:43.189 --> 00:23:46.931\nBecause one of the well-known but really\nnot spoken about secrets of commercial\n\n478\n00:23:46.931 --> 00:23:50.728\ncloud computing, the idea of consuming\nthrough a cloud service provider model is\n\n479\n00:23:50.728 --> 00:23:54.765\nthat cloud service provider's making\nsignificant investments in infrastructure.\n\n480\n00:23:54.765 --> 00:23:59.070\nRight, so The Googles, the Amazons,\nthe Microsofts, the VMwares,\n\n481\n00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.280\nthe Citrixes of the world.\n\n482\n00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.200\nThey go out and\nspend hundreds of millions,\n\n483\n00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.410\nbillions of dollars building data centers,\nproviding infrastructure and\n\n484\n00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:12.230\nessentially just building out\nthese massive, massive host farms.\n\n485\n00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.800\nRight?\n\n486\n00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.460\nThis is how Skynet started by the way.\n\n487\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.450\nRight?\nBoy and girls.\n\n488\n00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:16.559\nYou'll look back on this and\n\n489\n00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:18.970\ngo wow he was right it's just\nlike Terminator all over again.\n\n490\n00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:19.790\n>> It's where the machines began.\n\n491\n00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.240\n>> That's where everything begins,\nthe Matrix, Terminator, all in one.\n\n492\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:27.730\nSo, total random aside as you often see me\ndo during our conversations from time to\n\n493\n00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.700\ntime, so we were talking about\nmovies this morning, right?\n\n494\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.750\nYou and I and so I had an epiphany.\n\n495\n00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.650\nI was teaching a VMware class last week.\n\n496\n00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:38.610\nAnd we were talking about cloud\ninfrastructure and doing a bunch of stuff.\n\n497\n00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:43.330\nAnd at some point I made a reference\nto what is probably one of the best\n\n498\n00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.590\nearly movies with regards to security and\ninfosec.\n\n499\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.460\nWe talked about War Games,\nclassic movie right.\n\n500\n00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.690\nMatthew Broderick and Ally Sheedy, they're\nboth probably 12 years old in this movie,\n\n501\n00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.440\none of the first movies\nthey did certainly.\n\n502\n00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.230\nAnd when you see that movie and\n\n503\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.330\nyou see the, just step back and\nlook at the movie and\n\n504\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.140\nyou think about the concepts, right, and\nhe hacks in Matthew Broderick's character,\n\n505\n00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.150\nI'm gonna spoil this for everybody by\nthe way if you have not seen the movie.\n\n506\n00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.230\nSo big spoiler alert, timeout.\n\n507\n00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.100\nGo do something else for five minutes if\nyou don't wanna see how War Games ends.\n\n508\n00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:18.190\nSo the idea there is that he hacks into\nwhat he thinks is a gaming company, right.\n\n509\n00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:22.050\nOr ultimately hacks into a gaming computer\nto find out what games are there, starts\n\n510\n00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:26.290\nto play a game, and, without realizing it,\nalmost causes, right, nuclear war.\n\n511\n00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.970\nAnd so great concept for a movie.\n\n512\n00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.710\nAnd as he does this, and you step back and\nwatch this through the end of the movie,\n\n513\n00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.250\nyou realize that the computer network that\nwas built, essentially the WOPR computer,\n\n514\n00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:39.660\nthe game simulation computer is,\nthat whole storyline and\n\n515\n00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.400\nthat thought process gets replayed when\nyou look at all these later movies.\n\n516\n00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.730\nYou look at the Matrix,\nyou look at the Terminator series, right?\n\n517\n00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:49.020\nAnother great one, you look at Sneakers,\nI don't know if you remember if you saw\n\n518\n00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:54.240\nSneakers, Sidney Poitier, Robert Redford,\nDan Aykroyd's in the movie.\n\n519\n00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:58.180\nYou have a great movie about former\nCIA spooks that essentially go out,\n\n520\n00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.140\nstart their own vulnerability assessment\nrisk management business by hacking into\n\n521\n00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.730\ncompanies and get duped into stealing\nwhat is supposedly this master\n\n522\n00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.900\nencryption device that can unencrypt or\nencrypt anything.\n\n523\n00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:12.970\nAnd you see echos of these\nmovies throughout not just\n\n524\n00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:14.080\nstorylines repetitively,\n\n525\n00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.380\nbut look at the events that have been\ngoing on in the real world today.\n\n526\n00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:17.930\nYou can look at Sneakers.\n\n527\n00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.770\nAnd then you look at what\nhappened with the FBI and\n\n528\n00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:22.580\nthe Apple iPhone incident right\nover the last several months and\n\n529\n00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.320\ntrying to figure out if they're gonna\nget rights to encrypt this device.\n\n530\n00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.600\nAnd then ultimately the private\nsector comes along and\n\n531\n00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.250\nsays, no we can do that for you.\n\n532\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.820\nAnd shows the FBI essentially\nhow to break the encryption.\n\n533\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.760\nIt's interesting because you see\nechoes of all these themes constantly,\n\n534\n00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.160\nnot just in movies, but\nthen played out in real life.\n\n535\n00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.080\nAnd when we think about what the impact\nof the cloud is in all these areas,\n\n536\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.680\nyou see this rippling through.\n\n537\n00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.480\nAnd there was actually\na point to this entire run\n\n538\n00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.210\noff the rails misdirection\nin our conversation here.\n\n539\n00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.100\nSo the point is that as you look at\nthese themes about cloud computing and\n\n540\n00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.110\nwhat it was even though we\ndidn't know at the time and\n\n541\n00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:58.630\nultimately what it's become as we\nlook at it now and consume it.\n\n542\n00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.050\nIt's not quite SkyNet, right?\n\n543\n00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:01.580\nIt's not quite The Matrix, right?\n\n544\n00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.020\nIt's not there yet but the reality\nis we're building infrastructure\n\n545\n00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.950\nthat is going to be hyper converged\nthat is going to be interlinked.\n\n546\n00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.820\nCan we go back to the definitions\non the screen, just so\n\n547\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.560\nwe can hit them right as we're talking.\n\n548\n00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.380\nSo it is on-demand, right?\n\n549\n00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.970\nIt is broadly available\nthrough network access.\n\n550\n00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.080\nIt is resource pooled.\n\n551\n00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:23.480\nIt's rapidly elastic, scalable,\nupscalable, outscalable, down, on demand.\n\n552\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.250\nWe talk about bursting in the cloud.\n\n553\n00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.070\nWe talk about rapid elasticity.\n\n554\n00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.080\nAnd at the bottom,\nyou know measured service.\n\n555\n00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:33.500\nIt's essentially a measured concept where\nwe have metrics that we can understand,\n\n556\n00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.150\nlook at and monitor to\nunderstand what we're consuming.\n\n557\n00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:40.390\nEssentially we refer to measured services\nbeing referred to as pay as you go, right?\n\n558\n00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.170\nYou're essentially consuming, and\nwhen you consume you're paying for\n\n559\n00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.190\nwhat you consume.\n\n560\n00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.600\nAnd these are the five\nkey characteristics.\n\n561\n00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.280\nWhen you look at these,\n\n562\n00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.100\nthese are the themes that often\nplay out in these movies.\n\n563\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.090\nAnd so we've been seeing the cloud\ndefined without really realizing it was\n\n564\n00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.880\nthe cloud since the early 1980s when you\nlook at the themes that are going on in\n\n565\n00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.460\nthese kind of movies and how they work.\n\n566\n00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.770\nAnd they're repetitive because we\nsee them coming back again and\n\n567\n00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:02.810\nagain because they mirror life.\n\n568\n00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:06.130\nAnd it's kind of interesting when\nyou think about what the cloud is.\n\n569\n00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.590\nWhat it means and how we consume it today.\n\n570\n00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:08.710\nAt least for me anyway.\n\n571\n00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.310\nI find it to be very interesting\nthe parallels that exist out there.\n\n572\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.755\nBut you're not interested in that, so\n\n573\n00:28:12.755 --> 00:28:14.680\nwe're gonna keep talking about\nstuff you are interested in.\n\n574\n00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.591\n>> I'm gonna put my tin\nfoil hat on real quick.\n\n575\n00:28:16.591 --> 00:28:17.609\n[LAUGH]\n>> So you can prevent all the,\n\n576\n00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:18.593\nall the things from coming in, right?\n\n577\n00:28:18.593 --> 00:28:19.125\n>> [CROSSTALK] right.\n\n578\n00:28:19.125 --> 00:28:22.830\n>> So that's just I mean you look for\nthese little things that connect these\n\n579\n00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.420\nideas together, and\nyou find them in the strangest of places.\n\n580\n00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.710\nI randomly happened to catch,\nof all things, which is really random,\n\n581\n00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:35.270\nwhen we talk about the cloud, I happened\nto catch the end of a CSPAN briefing that\n\n582\n00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:40.200\nthe head of the NSA and\nthe head of the cyber security command\n\n583\n00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.010\nwas giving to the armed forces\noversight committee and you\n\n584\n00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.170\nsee all those government briefings, nobody\nusually pays a lot of attention to them.\n\n585\n00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.290\nBut it was a four hour\ntestimony that he had done\n\n586\n00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:53.650\nsometime in the last two weeks and\nthey were replaying it.\n\n587\n00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.560\nAnd I caught the last 20, 30 minutes of it\nover the weekend, before I came down to\n\n588\n00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.710\nget ready to spend time with you guys\nthis week in the studio And it was really\n\n589\n00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:03.080\ninteresting because the last part I saw\nhe was talking about cyber defense and\n\n590\n00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.050\nspecifically the admiral that's in charge\nnow, was talking about cloud computing and\n\n591\n00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.340\nit's impact on cyber defense.\n\n592\n00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.780\nAnd the things that they are able to at\nleast able to talk about in the open.\n\n593\n00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.660\nThat they're doing to align, to really\nbuild this defense infrastructure.\n\n594\n00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:18.710\nRecruit cloud professionals and\nhow they're doing that and\n\n595\n00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.530\nhow sequestration may impact their\nability to keep these people.\n\n596\n00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.650\nAnd there are some interesting topics\nthat are related to what we're\n\n597\n00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:25.580\nhere to talk about but\n\n598\n00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.180\nyou don't often think about those things\nwhen you think about cloud computing.\n\n599\n00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:29.980\nBut the need for\n\n600\n00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.050\ntalented professionals that understand\ncloud computing is growing by the day.\n\n601\n00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.220\nAnd the need to understand how to be\nable to secure cloud infrastructure\n\n602\n00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:41.260\nis something that is growing by the hour,\nby the minute.\n\n603\n00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.850\nI mean, there's just so much of it out\nthere that it's very difficult for\n\n604\n00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:46.980\ncompanies to understand how\nto do this effectively.\n\n605\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.630\nJust look at the latest list of\nbreaches that have occurred.\n\n606\n00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:54.780\nAnd in the last 10 days the biggest\none that we've seen, they're\n\n607\n00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:59.910\ncalling them the Panama papers, but the\nlaw firm in Panama that was involved or\n\n608\n00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.270\nhas been involved with all\nthese offshore accounts for\n\n609\n00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:07.080\ndecades creating these money havens that\nessentially people are parking money in.\n\n610\n00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.900\nViolating tax codes,\ndoing all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n611\n00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:15.450\nAnd just the amount of infrastructure\nthat exists to build these on paper,\n\n612\n00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.510\nbecause this is not we're gonna go\nbuild infrastructure in the cloud and\n\n613\n00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.580\nreally manage it, this is a bunch of shell\ncorporations that are being created on\n\n614\n00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.170\npaper, and\nmoving around essentially to hide money.\n\n615\n00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:27.880\nBut, when you think about how this all\ncame to light, somebody on the inside, and\n\n616\n00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.430\nwe don't know who and\nwe may or may not ever know.\n\n617\n00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.600\nBut somebody with high-level\naccess to this infrastructure.\n\n618\n00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.300\nThis internal information\nessentially dumped over 11 million\n\n619\n00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:42.260\nindividual documents into roughly\nabout two terabytes of data and\n\n620\n00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.560\nthen gave it to a German Newspaper and\nsaid hey, here you go and\n\n621\n00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.470\nyou guys will enjoy reading this and\nthen you do what you want with it.\n\n622\n00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.590\nAnd you know,\nthey use the cloud, essentially,\n\n623\n00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.170\nto perform this movement of information.\n\n624\n00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.650\nEverything we do today, no matter what\nit is, is somehow related to the cloud.\n\n625\n00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.660\nEven something where we're not\ntalking about cloud infrastructure.\n\n626\n00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.670\nThis was all done on paper, like I said,\nthis was not, I'm gonna go out and\n\n627\n00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.040\nbuild virtual infrastructure to\nmanage these shell corporations.\n\n628\n00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.670\nThis is a bunch of filings\nof registration of\n\n629\n00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.630\ncorporate documents in various countries.\n\n630\n00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.760\nThat are for\ndecades probably done by hand,\n\n631\n00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.340\nuntil recently none of this\nwas probably electronic.\n\n632\n00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.800\nAnd they said this database and the trove\nof data they got went back to the 1970s.\n\n633\n00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.780\nI mean, this was all basically paper,\nright, that was copied.\n\n634\n00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.270\nAnd when you think about it, and\n\n635\n00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:29.870\nyou think about the amount of time it took\nto dump roughly two terabytes of data.\n\n636\n00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:33.966\nThey made this kind of analogy when I\nheard them talk about this initially and\n\n637\n00:31:33.966 --> 00:31:36.022\nthis whole thing and how it happened.\n\n638\n00:31:36.022 --> 00:31:39.294\nThe commentator said if you think\nabout the Pentagon papers, and\n\n639\n00:31:39.294 --> 00:31:43.756\nwhen the Pentagon Papers break occurred\nback in the 1970's around the Vietnam War,\n\n640\n00:31:43.756 --> 00:31:48.039\nand what was going on, and how America was\nessentially keeping secret the losses that\n\n641\n00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:51.192\nwe had as a country, and\nultimately the problems we were having\n\n642\n00:31:51.192 --> 00:31:54.738\nfighting the war because we made\nthe war sound Like it was a lot better.\n\n643\n00:31:54.738 --> 00:31:55.593\nWe were winning.\n\n644\n00:31:55.593 --> 00:31:57.617\nWhen in fact there was\nevidence to the contrary.\n\n645\n00:31:57.617 --> 00:32:00.400\nWe were actually losing the wars,\nwe came to find out.\n\n646\n00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.620\nThat document leak, which is very,\nvery small, took weeks for\n\n647\n00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.908\nthe people involved to copy the documents\nto ultimately then move them and\n\n648\n00:32:08.908 --> 00:32:12.350\npass them along to the people in\nthe press that ultimately exposed\n\n649\n00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:15.630\nthe whole thing and wrote the book and\ndid everything that we now know about.\n\n650\n00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:20.590\nToday, fast forward 40 years,\napproximately 30-some odd years,\n\n651\n00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.780\nand somebody hands over two\nterabytes of data on a hard drive.\n\n652\n00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.600\nAnd it's over 11 million documents, 11 and\n\n653\n00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.280\na half million individual\ndocuments that were digitized.\n\n654\n00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.090\nAnd it was probably a few hours to\ncopy that material, most likely,\n\n655\n00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:33.210\nif you think about the logic\nof how that would happen.\n\n656\n00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:36.955\nSomebody would go grab whole of sections\nof documents that are electronic.\n\n657\n00:32:36.955 --> 00:32:39.900\nAnd essentially move them onto\na device and walk away with them.\n\n658\n00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.100\nAnd they said they even scraped out\nportions of an internal database\n\n659\n00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.490\nthat was essentially keeping track\nof all of these records, right?\n\n660\n00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:48.140\nSo, you have the right level of access,\nyou confer who may or\n\n661\n00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.302\nmay not have been involved with that,\n\n662\n00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:52.790\nprobably a senior level person in\nthe company, maybe an IT professional,\n\n663\n00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:56.560\nmaybe a partner in the law firm who\nwould have access to all these records.\n\n664\n00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:01.660\nBut, the knowledge necessary to file copy\nand move today is pretty ubiquitous.\n\n665\n00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.490\nI mean it's very rare that you find\nsomebody who knows a little bit about\n\n666\n00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.590\ncomputers and doesn't understand how\nto copy a file is my point, right?\n\n667\n00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:10.600\nAnd so accessing the cloud\nin cloud base technologies\n\n668\n00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.120\nmay not really require\na lot of information.\n\n669\n00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.710\nMay not really require a lot of\nskill on the part of the consumers.\n\n670\n00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:21.010\nIt's our skills, security professionals\nthat stand on the gateway,\n\n671\n00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.410\nstand on the border between\nthose customers and\n\n672\n00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:26.910\nthe internal resources that really\nhave to be sharpened and honed.\n\n673\n00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:30.450\nBecause if our cloud security\nprofessionals don't understand how to\n\n674\n00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.900\nprovide an environment, through policy,\nthrough procedure, through process,\n\n675\n00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.150\nthrough risk management,\nrisk assessment, risk analysis and\n\n676\n00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.270\nall the things we have to do to be secure.\n\n677\n00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:44.090\nIf we don't understand how to do all these\nthings, we don't understand the definition\n\n678\n00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:48.310\nof these central characteristics and as\nwe'll get into in upcoming conversations,\n\n679\n00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.220\nthe service models, and\nultimately the way in which we can deploy.\n\n680\n00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:54.520\nIf we don't understand all that and\nwe can't architect a solution\n\n681\n00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:58.330\nthat acts securely, we're going to have\na bunch of consumers that are taking\n\n682\n00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:02.420\nproprietary information out beyond\nthe border of our protection enclave,\n\n683\n00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.650\nour essentially our boundary for\nprotection.\n\n684\n00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.270\nAnd they're going to consume it in\nways that we are not going to be\n\n685\n00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.290\nable to protect.\n\n686\n00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.370\nThey're going to, in other words,\nopen up that information to risk and\n\n687\n00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.370\npotentially to vulnerability and threat.\n\n688\n00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.760\nBad actors will come along and\nprobably steal that information, right,\n\n689\n00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.050\nmore often than not.\n\n690\n00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:21.210\nAnd it may be something as simple as you\nwalking away from your phone or your\n\n691\n00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:24.886\ncomputer or both when you're out somewhere\nin public to get to go to your car.\n\n692\n00:34:24.886 --> 00:34:28.190\nI see this all the time at Starbucks,\nsomebody leaves their computer\n\n693\n00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:30.410\nconnected to whatever they're doing,\nwalks outside 20,\n\n694\n00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.170\n30 feet away to go get something out of\nthe car and gets involved in something.\n\n695\n00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.560\nThey see somebody,\nthey're talking on the phone.\n\n696\n00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.040\nAnd they stand outside for\na few minutes and\n\n697\n00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.220\nthey're not paying attention to\nwhat they're doing here, right,\n\n698\n00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:40.230\non the computer.\n\n699\n00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:43.740\nAnd if that computer is unlocked, what's\ngonna prevent me from walking up and\n\n700\n00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:47.020\nbecoming a member of your cloud for\nthe time that your away,\n\n701\n00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:51.520\nessentially becoming an authorized\nuser to consume that information?\n\n702\n00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.330\nOnly my good will and my desire not\nto really make your life miserable is\n\n703\n00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:58.310\nstanding between you, right,\nand a risk event, is my point.\n\n704\n00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.160\nAnd so as security professionals,\nwe have to think about that,\n\n705\n00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.150\nbecause no matter how hard we work,\nit's the user, right,\n\n706\n00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.710\nthe lowest common denominator\nis what we talk about.\n\n707\n00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:11.340\nIt's the user factor that I fear,\nthat I am concerned about,\n\n708\n00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.510\nthat I stay up at night as a security\nprofessional worrying about.\n\n709\n00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.810\nBecause I'm not gonna be in\ncontrol of the one random element\n\n710\n00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:21.410\nthat is most impactful in this\nconversation, which is typically the user.\n\n711\n00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.480\nWhat is the user going to do?\n\n712\n00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.010\nHow are they going to act?\n\n713\n00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:25.180\nHow are they going to behave?\n\n714\n00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.660\nAre all of the control elements\nI'm putting into place enough?\n\n715\n00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:28.260\nIf so, great.\n\n716\n00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.410\nIf not, what do I do, right?\n\n717\n00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.030\nI could lock the computer down.\n\n718\n00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.470\nI could put access\ncontrol on the front end.\n\n719\n00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.670\nI could do all sorts of stuff but\nif the user does something really dumb.\n\n720\n00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:41.690\nThey walk away and they purposely\nevade the security controls.\n\n721\n00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:45.140\nOr, let's be a little bit fair and\nhonest, maybe not purposely, but\n\n722\n00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.490\nwithout realizing the impact\nof what they're doing.\n\n723\n00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:51.755\nCuz I generally believe most users don't\nset out, right, on purpose to go about and\n\n724\n00:35:51.755 --> 00:35:56.025\nreally break the controls we put in place\nand purposely expose systems to risk.\n\n725\n00:35:56.025 --> 00:35:57.395\nThere's a small element of that, right?\n\n726\n00:35:57.395 --> 00:35:58.234\nThere are always bad actors.\n\n727\n00:35:58.234 --> 00:36:04.930\nBut the reality is most of those users\nare acting not out of a desire to do harm,\n\n728\n00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.859\nright, but rather simply out of ignorance.\n\n729\n00:36:08.859 --> 00:36:12.477\nThey just don't really stop and think\nabout the fact that what they're doing,\n\n730\n00:36:12.477 --> 00:36:14.259\nto them may not seem like a big deal, but\n\n731\n00:36:14.259 --> 00:36:17.800\nultimately is going to expose us to\nrisk and vulnerability and threat.\n\n732\n00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.900\nSo I think it's really out of\nignorance more than anything.\n\n733\n00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.752\nNot really because they want to do harm.\n\n734\n00:36:21.752 --> 00:36:25.890\nBut to be fair, users still at\nthe end of day cause problems.\n\n735\n00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.030\nI mean no matter what.\n\n736\n00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.340\nAnd we often joke about it\nas IT professionals, right?\n\n737\n00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.600\nThat if it wasn't for the users,\nwe wouldn't have a job and\n\n738\n00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.850\njob security because there'd\nbe nothing to worry about.\n\n739\n00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:37.060\nAnd so, we're thankful that users\nare using your systems, right?\n\n740\n00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.180\nBut, at the same time, we have to temper\nthat enthusiasm with an understanding\n\n741\n00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.760\nabout the fact that users\nhave to be controlled and\n\n742\n00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.650\nconstrained, just like everything else.\n\n743\n00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:48.600\nAnd if we put the right systems in place,\nwe could hope to achieve that end result.\n\n744\n00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.750\nAnd being a cloud security professional\nis really about that journey.\n\n745\n00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.490\nIt's about understanding how to build\nthose systems, how to assess risk,\n\n746\n00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:59.130\nhow to manage the concerns we have,\nboth for external and\n\n747\n00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.180\ninternal bad actors and threats and\nall the things we talk about and\n\n748\n00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.490\nwill continue to talk about\nin upcoming episodes.\n\n749\n00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:06.290\nAnd ultimately,\n\n750\n00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:09.600\nhow to use those five essential\ncharacteristics to manage the cloud.\n\n751\n00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.320\nCuz it's not enough to just\ndefine the cloud that way.\n\n752\n00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.280\nWe have to understand those essential\ncharacteristics to be able to manage\n\n753\n00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.270\nthe cloud, and it's very, very important\nfor us to think about those things, right?\n\n754\n00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.880\n>> Wow, some very exciting stuff, Adam.\n\n755\n00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.980\nI'm really looking forward to hearing\nyour perspective on these things and\n\n756\n00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.580\nall your expertise and\nyour experience coming at that.\n\n757\n00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.318\nI'm sure our viewers are as well.\n\n758\n00:37:28.318 --> 00:37:30.900\nI'm looking at our clock,\nit is severely out of time for us.\n\n759\n00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.770\nBut we do have to go on to part\ntwo because I know you got a ton\n\n760\n00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.990\nmore to talk about when it comes to\njust the foundational knowledge alone\n\n761\n00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:40.720\nbefore we jump into securing things.\n\n762\n00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.160\nSo thanks for joining us today and\nwe look forward to see you in part two.\n\n763\n00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.340\nWe thank you guys for joining us.\n\n764\n00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.200\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign of for ITProTV.\n\n765\n00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.790\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n766\n00:37:49.790 -->

another exciting\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.915\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie,\nand in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:23.480\nwe're continuing on with our Certified\nCloud Security Professional series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.372\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor is\n\n7\n00:00:26.372 --> 00:00:27.720\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.520\nAdam, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.360\nHow's it going, sir?\n>> Good, good, very good.\n\n10\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.920\nSo, we're gonna pick up where we left off.\n\n11\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.380\nWe were talking about some of the basics,\nthe intro, right?\n\n12\n00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.980\nThe foundational knowledge,\nif you will, with regards to Cloud.\n\n13\n00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.460\nYeah, we were talking about\nthe essential elements, right?\n\n14\n00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.380\nThe five building blocks.\n\n15\n00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.730\nAnd what we have to really think\nabout with regards to Cloud are,\n\n16\n00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.830\nwhat are the drivers?\n\n17\n00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.080\nWhen I talk about cloud computing,\nI want to, as a customer,\n\n18\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.090\nhave certain things I have in\nmind that I want to achieve.\n\n19\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.820\nA cloud service provider or CSP is gonna\nhave certain services they can offer.\n\n20\n00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.116\nAnd so we have to think about what the\nbusiness requirements are as a security\n\n21\n00:00:59.116 --> 00:01:02.530\nprofessional that are gonna drive the move\nto the cloud for the organization.\n\n22\n00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.020\nAnd we have to be aware of those, right?\n\n23\n00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.570\nAnd we identified some of these with\nregards to the five building blocks.\n\n24\n00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.720\nElasticity is often very important.\n\n25\n00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.920\nBusinesses want to be able to scale and\nscale on demand and consume cloud services\n\n26\n00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.110\non an as-needed basis, but they don't want\nto pay for what they don't use, right?\n\n27\n00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.550\nSo we want to be able to talk about\nelasticity as a key driver for\n\n28\n00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.560\ncloud computing.\n\n29\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.580\nExpandability kind of falls\ninto this category as well.\n\n30\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.476\nTheoretically, the idea of being\nable to scale up infrastructure but\n\n31\n00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:31.990\nthen also scale out and\nscale down on demand.\n\n32\n00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.912\nA lot of businesses are growing very\nrapidly in certain sectors today, but\n\n33\n00:01:35.912 --> 00:01:36.980\nthey are cyclical.\n\n34\n00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.210\nThey have seasons, many businesses do.\n\n35\n00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.680\nSo, if you think about hypothetically,\nlet's say Amazon.\n\n36\n00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.250\nProbably one of the biggest cloud\ncompanies in the world today.\n\n37\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.494\nBoth as a provider of retail services but\n\n38\n00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:51.916\nalso as a provider of cloud services\nbecause there's whole different segments\n\n39\n00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:54.960\nof business lines within\nthe Amazon business empire.\n\n40\n00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.822\nIf you look at the retail side\nwhere they are selling stuff,\n\n41\n00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:00.569\nthe reality of that model is\nwhile they're always busy,\n\n42\n00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:04.096\nthere are certain times of the year\nwhere they're really busy, right?\n\n43\n00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:06.864\nAnd they have to be able to scale\nmassively to be able to make sure their\n\n44\n00:02:06.864 --> 00:02:10.257\nwebsites stay online, make sure they can\ndeliver the volume of packages that people\n\n45\n00:02:10.257 --> 00:02:11.335\nessentially are buying.\n\n46\n00:02:11.335 --> 00:02:13.295\nYou have things like that.\n\n47\n00:02:13.295 --> 00:02:17.105\nAnd so when we have those business cycles,\nthe cloud's a perfect fit for that model,\n\n48\n00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:20.775\nbecause the cloud allows us to burst\nthrough elasticity and expandibility.\n\n49\n00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:22.285\nBut it also needs to be simple,\n\n50\n00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:25.235\nand simplicity is that third\ndriver we often think about.\n\n51\n00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:28.934\nIf the cloud's too complicated,\nit's gonna be very tough for us or for\n\n52\n00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:31.165\nanybody to consume it in a meaningful way.\n\n53\n00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:34.762\nWhen we talk about the ideas of\ncloud computing generically,\n\n54\n00:02:34.762 --> 00:02:39.393\nwe often talk about the idea that we can\ngo out and essentially for a monthly fee,\n\n55\n00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:44.511\nif we're talking about just generic cloud\nservices, without getting into the details\n\n56\n00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:49.310\nof desktop versus security versus database\nversus infrastructure as a service.\n\n57\n00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.161\nSo we just talk generically about\nconsuming and buying something through\n\n58\n00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:57.660\na pay as you go subscription-based as a\nservice model, customers get that, right?\n\n59\n00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.900\nSo I spend $12 a month, and\nI get these five things?\n\n60\n00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:01.880\nThat's all I have to do?\n\n61\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.801\nAnd essentially as a CSP,\nas a cloud service provider, we say,\n\n62\n00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:06.911\nyeah essentially,\nsign this piece of paper,\n\n63\n00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.850\nagree to doing that for\nat least 12 months typically, right?\n\n64\n00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.010\nSo usually an annual contract.\n\n65\n00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.060\nAnd as long as you do that, or if you\nwanna pay a little bit more you could go\n\n66\n00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.800\nmonthly cuz you don't necessarily\nneed to commit to an annual.\n\n67\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.550\nBut there's a premium for that, right?\n\n68\n00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.810\nThere's an upcharge.\n\n69\n00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.990\nBut essentially, that's good,\nthat's all you gotta do.\n\n70\n00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.430\nAnd, by the way, as the cloud provider,\nwe'll guarantee you certain things.\n\n71\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.089\nWe'll talk about what an SLA\nis in a little while, and\n\n72\n00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.337\nwhat a service-level agreement means, and\n\n73\n00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:35.534\nthe essential agreement between a provider\nand a customer with regards to up time and\n\n74\n00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:38.540\nservices availability and\nthings of that nature.\n\n75\n00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.580\nAnd the customer has rights.\n\n76\n00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.120\nSo does the service provider,\nand we essentially then agree and\n\n77\n00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.930\nhave a requirement for\nhow we're gonna manage those.\n\n78\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:47.920\nAnd that's about it.\n\n79\n00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.200\nI mean, cloud's not real complicated.\n\n80\n00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.010\nPeople think it's this\nincredibly complex solution.\n\n81\n00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.030\nBut the reality is,\nit's really not very involved at all.\n\n82\n00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.530\nWhat gets involved is how\nwe layer on those surfaces.\n\n83\n00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.110\nHow we combine them together.\n\n84\n00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.598\nHow we consume them across the enterprise\nand through one enterprise to another and\n\n85\n00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:09.440\nhow we then scale those services,\nmassively so that customers\n\n86\n00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.860\nin where in the world can essentially\nhave access to those resources.\n\n87\n00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.080\nThat's when cloud gets interesting.\n\n88\n00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.560\nIt's also when it gets complicated.\n\n89\n00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.541\nAnd the idea behind simplicity can scale\nmassively if we think about how to put\n\n90\n00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:24.600\nthings in place like process,\nlike procedure, like policy,\n\n91\n00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.581\nlike business alignment, continuous\nmonitoring, things of that nature,\n\n92\n00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:33.820\nthat allow us to understand how\nto do that and keep it simple.\n\n93\n00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.590\nWhat customers want, essentially,\n\n94\n00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.310\nis the ability to consume services in\nthe cloud without the necessary need and\n\n95\n00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.840\nthe complexity of understanding\nwhat that really means.\n\n96\n00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.850\nThey just wanna know when they\ngo there it'll be there and\n\n97\n00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.550\nthey wanna know that if they pay their\nbill, everything is taken care, and\n\n98\n00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.950\nessentially they can do what they want.\n\n99\n00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.854\nJust like when you go out to eat at a\nrestaurant, you don't really want to see,\n\n100\n00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:56.630\nat least most of us anyway, right,\ndon't want to see our food being made.\n\n101\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.380\nBecause when you see food being made,\nit takes all the mystery and\n\n102\n00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.740\nthe joy out of having that\nmeal traditionally, right?\n\n103\n00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.534\nAt least that what my wife says on\na regular basis cuz she doesn't\n\n104\n00:05:04.534 --> 00:05:05.460\nwant to cook.\n\n105\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.390\nSo she says, hey,\nI'd rather go out and eat.\n\n106\n00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.150\nOkay, no problem.\n\n107\n00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.700\nWe can go do that.\n\n108\n00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.524\nBut you don't want to see your food\nbeing made in the kitchen typically in\n\n109\n00:05:11.524 --> 00:05:13.390\na restaurant cuz it's a dirty,\nmessy affair.\n\n110\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.666\nAnd the reality is if you did,\nyou probably would never eat there again,\n\n111\n00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:19.960\nat least most of us would probably\nnever eat there again anyway, right?\n\n112\n00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.227\nBecause you'll see all sorts of\nthings that would just make your hair\n\n113\n00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:24.320\nstand on end.\n\n114\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.530\nYou mean, they dropped that, they put it\nback up on the grill, dusted it off and\n\n115\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.370\ncooked it a little bit so it was gonna\nbe safe, at least in theory, anyway.\n\n116\n00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.920\nYeah, maybe they did, who knows?\n\n117\n00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.220\nYou mean the guy's cooking and\nhe's sticking his spoon in there and\n\n118\n00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.410\ntasting my food?\n\n119\n00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.670\nYeah, they do that sometimes.\n\n120\n00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.870\nYou mean he's not wearing gloves?\n\n121\n00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.050\nWell, he may or may not,\nI don't know, hard to say.\n\n122\n00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.384\nBut if you don't wanna have\nthose things possibly happening,\n\n123\n00:05:44.384 --> 00:05:47.480\nif you wanna control all the elements,\nyou're gonna have to go build it yourself.\n\n124\n00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.300\nYou're gonna have to go home and cook, or\n\n125\n00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.970\nyou're gonna build a private cloud that\nyou're gonna maintain and run on-site.\n\n126\n00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.020\nWhen you're trusting others to do it for\nyou, you're gonna off-load that, right?\n\n127\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.910\nEssentially give it to a provider and\nlet them do that.\n\n128\n00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.310\nAnd they're gonna mask\nall those details and\n\n129\n00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.940\ngive you a very specifically defined and\nwell-regulated form of control that's\n\n130\n00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.040\nmutually agreed upon based on\na hosting agreement and an SLA.\n\n131\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.630\nSo as a result,\n\n132\n00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.860\nwe have to really think about what\ncloud means to us as a customer.\n\n133\n00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.810\nBecomes very, very important, right?\n\n134\n00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.676\nWhen you talk to a customer\nof cloud provider and say,\n\n135\n00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.150\nwhat is your expectation?\n\n136\n00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.757\nOr when I go in and I do audits, and\nI have to speak to the customer and\n\n137\n00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:24.228\nessentially say okay,\nyou've got all these cloud services,\n\n138\n00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:25.410\nwhat are your expectations?\n\n139\n00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.960\nWhat are they supposed to do?\n\n140\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.490\nWhat are you using them for?\n\n141\n00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.160\nHow are they set up?\n\n142\n00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.750\nWhat are we looking for\nby way of validating your usage?\n\n143\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.830\nI have to get them to really sit down and\nthink through what they are expecting.\n\n144\n00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.290\nNot what they are getting.\n\n145\n00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.000\nNot what they potentially are consuming,\nbut rather what their expectations are.\n\n146\n00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.500\nBecause expectations may or\nmay not match reality.\n\n147\n00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.500\nA lot of times cloud customers think\nthat cloud is one thing when in\n\n148\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.200\nfact it is something radically different.\n\n149\n00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.466\nAnd the provider may or\n\n150\n00:06:56.466 --> 00:07:00.070\nmay not do a good job of explaining\nthat to the customer, right?\n\n151\n00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.483\nWe've probably all found ourselves in\na situation where we're trying to buy\n\n152\n00:07:03.483 --> 00:07:06.528\nsomething or we're in the middle\nof a decision about something, and\n\n153\n00:07:06.528 --> 00:07:09.700\nwe're always thinking we'd like\na little more information, right?\n\n154\n00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.100\nAnd we may not know enough or feel\nconfident enough to make the decision, but\n\n155\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.240\nwe may get to the point where we have to.\n\n156\n00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.560\nWe may or\nmay not have enough information to do so.\n\n157\n00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.190\nAnd so, I don't know if any\nof you speak Latin out there,\n\n158\n00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:24.030\nif you are a Latin person or not,\nbut you'll caveat emptor, right?\n\n159\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.310\nYou guys know what caveat emptor is?\n\n160\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.335\nAnd of course there's dead silence,\nyou could hear crickets chirping,\n\n161\n00:07:29.335 --> 00:07:32.552\nboth in the studio, cuz nobody here\nknows what caveat emptor is, or outside,\n\n162\n00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.236\ncuz of course you're not really there.\n\n163\n00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:36.180\nYou're watching me live and or remotely.\n\n164\n00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.260\nBut you're gonna watch this later.\n\n165\n00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.680\nCaveat emptor is,\nyou know what caveat emptor is in Latin?\n\n166\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.270\n>> Something to do with exemptions?\n\n167\n00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.335\n>> Well not quite, close.\n\n168\n00:07:43.335 --> 00:07:44.920\nExemption's actually not a bad\nway of thinking about it.\n\n169\n00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.580\nBut it's Latin for buyer beware.\n\n170\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.040\nRight essentially, buyer beware is that\nthought process we often talk about and\n\n171\n00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.598\nrefer to when we say it\nis the responsibility or\n\n172\n00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:54.380\nwe imply essentially, right?\n\n173\n00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.404\nIt is the responsibility of the customer,\nthe buyer,\n\n174\n00:07:57.404 --> 00:07:59.720\nto understand what they're consuming.\n\n175\n00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.668\nExemptions may or may not come into that.\n\n176\n00:08:01.668 --> 00:08:05.892\nExemptions are actually a nice way to\nwork in some of the things that may or\n\n177\n00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:08.395\nmay not be part of that consumption model.\n\n178\n00:08:08.395 --> 00:08:10.014\nThe cloud service provider\nmay have some exemptions.\n\n179\n00:08:10.014 --> 00:08:14.172\nThey may say, well you can have this\naccess to this cloud service, but only for\n\n180\n00:08:14.172 --> 00:08:17.638\nthis amount of time or at this rate\nof consumption with this dollar\n\n181\n00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:21.350\nvalue associated with it,\nfive cents per hour or whatever it is.\n\n182\n00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.070\nYou scale up,\n\n183\n00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.600\nyou want more cores, you want more RAM,\nyou want more infrastructure, it goes up.\n\n184\n00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.940\nYou can have anything you want,\nit's a sliding scale model.\n\n185\n00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.260\nBut you're gonna pay more money, right?\n\n186\n00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.550\nAnd so exemptions are actually a really\ngood way of thinking about that.\n\n187\n00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:33.050\nI like that a lot.\n\n188\n00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.590\nIt's a really good way of\nunderstanding the concept.\n\n189\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.090\nAnd so caveat emptor, right?\n\n190\n00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.700\nIt's the thing we often talk\nabout with cloud customers.\n\n191\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.320\nDo you know, Mr. and Mrs. cloud customer,\nwhat it is you're consuming?\n\n192\n00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.520\nOr are you taking the cloud\nservice provider's word for it and\n\n193\n00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.280\nnever validating them.\n\n194\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.840\nI have this conversation with customers\nall the time, with regards to risk\n\n195\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.140\nmanagement and risk assessment when we do\naudits and votability assessments, right?\n\n196\n00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.300\nJust cuz the Cloud provider said this\nis what it is, have you tested that,\n\n197\n00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.240\ndo you know?\n\n198\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.880\nHave you asked them what that means,\nscalable this way,\n\n199\n00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.480\nokay great what does really\nscalable that way means?\n\n200\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.080\nWe're supposed to get this\namount of infrastructure,\n\n201\n00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.710\nwell, are you really getting it?\n\n202\n00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.230\nYou're only supposed to pay for\nwhat you're using.\n\n203\n00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.590\nAre you using that amount?\n\n204\n00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:12.580\nDo you have a dashboard?\n\n205\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.170\nDo you understand what that looks like?\n\n206\n00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.580\nThere's all these things, right,\nthat in cloud we have to consider\n\n207\n00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.100\nbecause remember we're not\nmanaging all the infrastructure.\n\n208\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.260\nTheoretically anyway.\n\n209\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.210\nWe may very well be.\n\n210\n00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.420\nWe may be doing an on\nprem private cloud and\n\n211\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.870\nIT may be the cloud provider\nessentially to the business, but\n\n212\n00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.960\nwhile that happens a great deal,\nthat doesn't happen all the time.\n\n213\n00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.430\nAnd for\nevery model that that is set up that way,\n\n214\n00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.565\nwe also outsource a great deal of that\ninfrastructure to a third party cloud\n\n215\n00:09:36.565 --> 00:09:40.545\nprovider and essentially say, here you go\nI'm gonna write you a check every month.\n\n216\n00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:42.675\nTell me how many zeros to\nput on the end of that.\n\n217\n00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.235\nAnd for that amount of zeros I get a\ncertain number of users in that system and\n\n218\n00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:49.337\nyou're gonna manage the liability\nthat had in that concern\n\n219\n00:09:49.337 --> 00:09:52.697\nof provisioning that infrastructure,\nmaintaining it right,\n\n220\n00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:56.777\npatch managing it, securing it,\nbacking it up, doing BCDR.\n\n221\n00:09:56.777 --> 00:09:58.107\nI ran out of fingers.\n\n222\n00:09:58.107 --> 00:10:01.997\nDoing BCDR and all that other kind\nof stuff that goes into that, right?\n\n223\n00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:05.777\nAnd we're essentially transferring risk, I\nmean that's really what Cloud computing is\n\n224\n00:10:05.777 --> 00:10:08.397\nall about if you do it through\na third party provider.\n\n225\n00:10:08.397 --> 00:10:11.337\nYou're paying somebody to take on the risk\nof running the infrastructure for\n\n226\n00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:14.620\nyou, which is not a bad thing, but\nis something we have to acknowledge and\n\n227\n00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.950\nunderstand is happening.\n\n228\n00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.600\nAnd so there are many risks, security\nrisks, associated with cloud computing.\n\n229\n00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.300\nThe distributed and/or multitenant cloud\nhosting environments that many of us\n\n230\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.370\nbecome part of, the Amazon web services,\nthe Microsoft Office 365 and\n\n231\n00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:32.660\nAzure fabric of the world,\nthat is all multitenant hosting.\n\n232\n00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:33.947\nMeaning it's you and\n\n233\n00:10:33.947 --> 00:10:37.830\na thousand companies you don't know and\nhave nothing to do with that are being\n\n234\n00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.250\nhosted on the same common resource\npooled infrastructure by the provider.\n\n235\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:47.160\nTo be fair and to be accurate,\nthe provider puts many logical and\n\n236\n00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.980\nphysical security mechanisms\nin place to isolate you and\n\n237\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.840\nisolate everybody else from each other.\n\n238\n00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.660\nSo that your data, your infrastructure,\nand your capabilities to inspect and\n\n239\n00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.190\nintraspect through that\ninfrastructure are provided but\n\n240\n00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.560\nare, if it's done the right way, isolated.\n\n241\n00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.690\nSo you're limited to your own slice\nof that platform essentially.\n\n242\n00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:11.190\n>> Adam, really quickly, how much\ncontrol do we as the consumer have\n\n243\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.660\nover the infrastructure that we\nare outsourcing to the cloud?\n\n244\n00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.900\n>> So it's a great question right because\nthe thought process is ultimately if I\n\n245\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:24.200\ngive you Mr. Cloud Provider the ability\nto manage this, what does it really mean?\n\n246\n00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.820\nWhat am I responsible for?\n\n247\n00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.510\nWhat are you responsible for?\n\n248\n00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.820\nAnd ultimately who's accountable, right,\nfor risk in management on the platform?\n\n249\n00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.040\nSo, it's a great question and it's\nan easy one to answer at some level but\n\n250\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.640\nit's also incredibly complicated\nto answer at others.\n\n251\n00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.390\nThe simple answer is,\nwe should look to our hosting documents.\n\n252\n00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.850\nSo, essentially our contracts, right?\n\n253\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:48.070\nAnd our SLAs to have a sense of what we\nas the customer would be responsible for\n\n254\n00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.870\nand of course by extension what\nthe provider is responsible for.\n\n255\n00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.460\nThe challenge is, in many of those\ndocuments it's not clearly laid out.\n\n256\n00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.331\nAnd in many of those\ndocuments it maybe implied or\n\n257\n00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:01.780\nit may not be stated clearly as\nto who is responsible for what.\n\n258\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.004\nWe're gonna get into this a lot more in\nupcoming episodes where we talk about\n\n259\n00:12:06.004 --> 00:12:09.898\nbased on service model, IaaS,\ninfrastructure as a service, PaaS,\n\n260\n00:12:09.898 --> 00:12:13.640\nplatform as a service, SaaS,\nsoftware as a service.\n\n261\n00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.712\nWho is responsible?\n\n262\n00:12:14.712 --> 00:12:16.630\nWhat does the customer have to do?\n\n263\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:18.050\nWhat does the provider have to do?\n\n264\n00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.594\nSo for example,\nby one way of answering your question.\n\n265\n00:12:20.594 --> 00:12:25.250\nIn a SaaS model, software as a service,\ntop of the service model stack,\n\n266\n00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.170\nwe're implying IaaS and\nPaaS are part of this overall model.\n\n267\n00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.340\nThe customer is essentially renting\nfrom the provider a fully provisioned\n\n268\n00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:39.400\ninfrastructure and\nplatform environment that is set up,\n\n269\n00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.440\nprovisioned, managed, monitored and\nmaintained by the cloud provider.\n\n270\n00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.560\nAnd what the customer is responsible for\nare two things.\n\n271\n00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.250\nAnd really two things\nonly in the SaaS model.\n\n272\n00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.180\nProvisioning of user access,\nso essentially access control.\n\n273\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.750\nYou get to assign users, create them,\nmodify access control rights, for users.\n\n274\n00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.130\nSo, you as the customer,\nare responsible for that.\n\n275\n00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.520\nYou have rights to do that.\n\n276\n00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.630\nThe provider may have\nback end capabilities to\n\n277\n00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:07.930\nhave administrative control\nabove those users and they do.\n\n278\n00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.760\nBut you essentially provision user access.\n\n279\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.070\nSo you're responsible for access control.\n\n280\n00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.130\nIn addition, you're responsible for\ninitially either loading your data or\n\n281\n00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.200\nproviding it in some form to the provider,\nor creating it brand new as you go.\n\n282\n00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.200\nDepends on the model,\nwhat you're looking to do.\n\n283\n00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.760\nBut essentially as the cloud customer,\nyou're responsible for creating and\n\n284\n00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.060\nproviding data into the system, and\nyou're responsible for user access.\n\n285\n00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.060\nHelp beyond that, the cloud provider\nis responsible for everything else.\n\n286\n00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:39.080\nSo in SaaS, the window of responsiblity is\nvery narrowly defined for the customer.\n\n287\n00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.140\nWhereas in IaaS,\nat the very opposite end of that spectrum,\n\n288\n00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.940\nInfrastructure as a Service,\nthe cloud customer is renting,\n\n289\n00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.940\nright, the infrastructure\nfrom the cloud provider.\n\n290\n00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:54.950\nWe go to the cloud provider,\nand we say I want five hosts,\n\n291\n00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.710\nI want each host to be provisioned\nwith five gigabytes of ram, and\n\n292\n00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:01.770\nI want each host to have five cpu cords.\n\n293\n00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.070\nI know we would not normally do an odd\nnumber, I'm just doing that for\n\n294\n00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:05.707\nmath because I'll never\nkeep track of all that.\n\n295\n00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:07.252\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If I gave you real numbers I'll be here\n\n296\n00:14:07.252 --> 00:14:08.725\nand I'll never be able\nto remember what I said.\n\n297\n00:14:08.725 --> 00:14:12.245\nSo, just five of everything,\nfive hosts, five network cards,\n\n298\n00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:14.997\nfive gigabytes of memory,\nfive CPUs per host, and\n\n299\n00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:17.880\nI want five gigabytes of storage,\nright, per host.\n\n300\n00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.350\nVery, very obviously small and\nstripped down version.\n\n301\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.150\nYou get the idea.\n\n302\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:22.320\nScale that up, right?\n\n303\n00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.890\nSo five of everything, great.\n\n304\n00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.780\nSo the cloud service\nprovider is responsible for\n\n305\n00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.670\ngiving me that infrastructure from\na common resource pool of massive numbers\n\n306\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.740\nof hosts, massively provisioned with back\nend storage on storage area networks.\n\n307\n00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:38.090\nThat probably runs in the exobytes, right?\n\n308\n00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:43.320\nAnd very fast network access on the back\nplane with fiber channel most likely.\n\n309\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.940\nWe talk about 40 Gigabyte\nnetworks most likely\n\n310\n00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.692\non the back plane in the data center.\n\n311\n00:14:47.692 --> 00:14:51.210\nWe're talking about very very large\ncomplex enterprise infrastructure.\n\n312\n00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.750\nThey're gonna carve off,\nlet me speak slowly and enunciate, they're\n\n313\n00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.050\ngoing to carve off infrastructure and hand\nit to us, essentially, as the customer.\n\n314\n00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:02.750\nWhat we then have to do,\nour responsibility's very broad.\n\n315\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.420\nWe're responsible for provisioning\nthat infrastructure that we're given.\n\n316\n00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.010\nSo, we have to load operating systems,\nwhatever they are windows, lynx,\n\n317\n00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.200\nyou name it, doesn't matter, our choice.\n\n318\n00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.630\nWe have to then configure that\ninfrastructure, so after we load\n\n319\n00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.280\nthe operating systems we have to go in and\nconfigure the way we want them to run,\n\n320\n00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.490\nwe have to set up network access\nbetween the VMs, we have to set up and\n\n321\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.110\ncarve out and format our storage array so\nwe understand how to use it,\n\n322\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:32.800\nand assign lungs to the various hosts and\nvirtual machines, whatever we want to do.\n\n323\n00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:36.582\nAnd we're responsible for everything\nessentially that goes on with that\n\n324\n00:15:36.582 --> 00:15:39.449\ninfrastructure beyond the basic\nprovisioning of it and\n\n325\n00:15:39.449 --> 00:15:41.288\nproviding of it essentially to us.\n\n326\n00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:44.202\nNow having said that we're not\nresponsible for everything.\n\n327\n00:15:44.202 --> 00:15:46.848\nI want to put a little\nasterisk next to that term or\n\n328\n00:15:46.848 --> 00:15:50.272\nthat statement because the service\nprovider is still managing\n\n329\n00:15:50.272 --> 00:15:53.970\nthe physical infrastructure and\nthe common shared resource pool.\n\n330\n00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:58.010\nThat is used to give us our\nmulti-tenant slice that's isolated.\n\n331\n00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.700\nThat responsibility belongs with\nthe service provider regardless of model.\n\n332\n00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.666\nThey may choose to expose slices of that\ninfrastructure to us as the customer,\n\n333\n00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:08.460\nessentially hand us\nthe rights to manage them.\n\n334\n00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.320\nBut the infrastructure overall,\nthe all-up infrastructure,\n\n335\n00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.570\nis managed by the service provider.\n\n336\n00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.020\nWe don't see all that.\n\n337\n00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.260\nIn other words, if there was a problem\nwith the networking on the back plane for\n\n338\n00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.780\nour five hosts, we as the customer,\ncannot go fix that.\n\n339\n00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:26.895\nThe infrastructure is managed by\nthe team that the cloud service provider\n\n340\n00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:30.490\nmaintains,the administrators and their\ndata centers, whoever those people are.\n\n341\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.490\nWe still have to partner,\nwe will have to interact with them,\n\n342\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:37.380\nbecause our responsibility is going to be\ndelimited, in a sense, withdrawn, right,\n\n343\n00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.650\nat that boundary of our infrastructure and\n\n344\n00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.170\nour little slice of the much\nlarger multi-tenant pot.\n\n345\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.030\nWith regards to pass,\nsince we've done the other two,\n\n346\n00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.510\nmight as well do the third one and\nget that out of the way.\n\n347\n00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.270\nWith regard to pass in the middle,\nplatform is the service.\n\n348\n00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.530\nWe get the infrastructure piece and\nthe platform.\n\n349\n00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:56.940\nSo essentially we go to the provider and\nwe say to Amazon or\n\n350\n00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.820\nto Microsoft, hey, I need the five hosts\nwith everything that i just described and,\n\n351\n00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.780\nby the way, I want them loaded this\nway with this operating system.\n\n352\n00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.050\nI want them to run Windows\nserver 2012 R two or\n\n353\n00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:12.190\nI want them run Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nversion 6.5 or whatever.\n\n354\n00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:15.270\nAnd the cloud service provider\nessentially provisions\n\n355\n00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:19.180\nthe infrastructure stack along\nwith the operating system for\n\n356\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.820\nthose five hosts and they hand it\nto us and say, okay here you go.\n\n357\n00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.260\nYou've asked us to set that up,\nit's all set up.\n\n358\n00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.790\nAnd now you're, Mr. Customer, gonna\nmanage what we call the dev environment.\n\n359\n00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.885\nSo you're gonna put app load's on top.\n\n360\n00:17:30.885 --> 00:17:35.785\nYou may run share point, you may run\nexchange, you may run web sets or\n\n361\n00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:36.935\nyou may run whatever.\n\n362\n00:17:36.935 --> 00:17:40.213\nOr, you may visualize on top of that and\nstart loading up vms, right,\n\n363\n00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:42.185\nwhich is typically what\nwe've done as well,\n\n364\n00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:44.607\ncreating virtual machine instances\nto do your development work.\n\n365\n00:17:44.607 --> 00:17:47.147\nYour hosting, your provisioning, whatever.\n\n366\n00:17:47.147 --> 00:17:51.377\nAll that is done, so now we're splitting\nthe management of that infrastructure\n\n367\n00:17:51.377 --> 00:17:55.347\nroughly between the cloud service provider\nand the customer because the provider\n\n368\n00:17:55.347 --> 00:17:58.737\nis creating the infrastructure and\nsetting it up and monitoring it.\n\n369\n00:17:58.737 --> 00:18:01.747\nBut now we, the customer, are in charge of\nmonitoring it and what goes on top of it.\n\n370\n00:18:01.747 --> 00:18:05.517\nSo, now we get into some interesting\nterritory from a security perspective.\n\n371\n00:18:05.517 --> 00:18:07.490\nHow do we deal with log it.\n\n372\n00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.040\nHow do we deal with monitoring the\ninfrastructure versus monitoring the app\n\n373\n00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.740\nloads that run on top,\nwho has rights to that data.\n\n374\n00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.580\nWho has visibility to from\nan auditability perspective?\n\n375\n00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.395\nWho has visibility into it from\na risk management perspective?\n\n376\n00:18:19.395 --> 00:18:21.230\nThe provider controls a great deal of it.\n\n377\n00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.450\nWe may not be able to see all of that.\n\n378\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.790\nAnd we may have to partner\nwith them to get that data.\n\n379\n00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:28.460\nSo it becomes a very\ncomplicated set of concerns and\n\n380\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.850\nwe're gonna develop this\nthought process more over time.\n\n381\n00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.351\nBut there's a lot of risk associated\nwith this, there's business risk,\n\n382\n00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:37.910\nreputational risk, there's compliance\nrisk, talked a little bit hinted\n\n383\n00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.708\nat some of these already,\nlegal and regulatory concerns.\n\n384\n00:18:40.708 --> 00:18:45.221\nIn many countries today,\nit is not very clear jurisdictionaly what\n\n385\n00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:50.129\nhappens to data based on data moving\nthrough that system for a small period\n\n386\n00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:54.738\nof time versus data residing in\nthat system over time historically.\n\n387\n00:18:54.738 --> 00:18:57.271\nSo, to be clear and\na little less obtuse about that,\n\n388\n00:18:57.271 --> 00:19:00.338\nwe talked about data existing\nin three stages traditionally.\n\n389\n00:19:00.338 --> 00:19:03.599\nWe talked about data life cycles,\nwe talk about data in transit.\n\n390\n00:19:03.599 --> 00:19:05.532\nWe often refer to that\nas data on the wire,\n\n391\n00:19:05.532 --> 00:19:08.100\ndata moving between two end points, right?\n\n392\n00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:09.590\nYou send an email to somebody and\n\n393\n00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.340\nthey send it back to you,\nthat's data in transit.\n\n394\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.280\nData in use, that's the data in\nthe application on your desktop,\n\n395\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.326\nyou looking at that email in Outlook,\nreading a Word document, is data in use.\n\n396\n00:19:20.326 --> 00:19:24.210\nAnd then we talked about data at rest,\noften called data in storage.\n\n397\n00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.070\nWhere do you actually put data short,\nmedium,\n\n398\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:30.200\nlong term when it's not actively being\nused or it is actively being used but\n\n399\n00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.900\nyou're calling it up out\nof a storage facility\n\n400\n00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.250\nsomewhere where you essentially have it\nparked, right, and then you call it back.\n\n401\n00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:40.590\nSo this is data in storage,\nor data at rest.\n\n402\n00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.000\nSo data at rest, data in transit,\n\n403\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.690\ndata in use, three phases of datas\nthat moves through our systems.\n\n404\n00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.700\nWe pretty well understand the concept and\n\n405\n00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:54.730\nthe strategies as well as the legal\nrequirements associated with data in use.\n\n406\n00:19:54.730 --> 00:20:00.630\nAnd data in transit is a grey area, and\ndata in storage is well understood.\n\n407\n00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:03.350\nWhen I say well understood,\nI mean data sits in one place for\n\n408\n00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.740\na long period of time, it's subject\nto the laws and requirements and\n\n409\n00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:09.140\nregulatory concerns of that jurisdiction.\n\n410\n00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.770\nWe know that and\nthat's really not up for discussion.\n\n411\n00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:16.570\nYou're using data in the United States\nspecifically, let's say hypothetically,\n\n412\n00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.430\nto engage in a discussion with somebody,\n\n413\n00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.430\nand you're having an exchange over WebEx\nor you're having an exchange over email.\n\n414\n00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:27.300\nThe data in use on your desktop is\ngoverned by whatever policies and\n\n415\n00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.480\nlaws are in place in the locale that\nyou're at based on your company,\n\n416\n00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.320\nyour company's requirements,\nand the laws of the state and\n\n417\n00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.570\nthe federal bureaucracies\nthat you deal with.\n\n418\n00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:38.380\nMeaning the government may or\n\n419\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.760\nmay not have rights to see that data in\nreal time and they may or may not have\n\n420\n00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.770\nrights to come take it when they serve\nwhat's called the new discovery order.\n\n421\n00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:47.500\nIt depends on the country and\nit depends on where you are.\n\n422\n00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.290\nData in storage is governed the same way.\n\n423\n00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.270\nIf data's sitting in a data center, and\n\n424\n00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:56.460\na cloud service provider owns that data\ncenter, it's sitting in Europe, lets say.\n\n425\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:00.270\nIt's governed by the European\nunions laws on data privacy.\n\n426\n00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:02.560\nSo directive 9546 for instance,\n\n427\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.260\nwhich is the privacy directive\ncurrently in force in the EU.\n\n428\n00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.420\nIt has been for many many years now.\n\n429\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.730\nAnd the right to be forgotten, which is\nan add on to that data privacy directive,\n\n430\n00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.250\nwhich essentially allows people,\nEuropean Union citizens,\n\n431\n00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:21.900\nto demand of their cloud providers,\nthat they have a right to be able to\n\n432\n00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.250\nerase pertinent private data that uniquely\nidentifies them from cloud platforms,\n\n433\n00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:30.250\nif they follow the specified process or\nprocedure the cloud provider has put out.\n\n434\n00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.040\nIn other words, the cloud provider by law\nnow has to offer the user an opt out of\n\n435\n00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.420\nthe cloud platform to erase their data and\nremove them from any systems where that\n\n436\n00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.580\ndata may be seen or compromised,\nat least to the best of their ability.\n\n437\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.680\nRight, there are always exceptions\nto every rule, every law.\n\n438\n00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.520\nBut essentially they have\na right to be forgotten.\n\n439\n00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.120\nWe don't have that right in the United\nStates, at least not currently, not today.\n\n440\n00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.080\nAnd our privacy laws are very very,\nlet's call them immature,\n\n441\n00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.050\nby comparison, to what we see in\ncertain other parts of the world.\n\n442\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.910\nThey are still being formed and we don't\nhave anywhere near the guarantees or\n\n443\n00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.490\nrights or protections that a citizen\nof the EU currently will have.\n\n444\n00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.490\nAnd as a result of that, data that is\nstored in the data center in the EU\n\n445\n00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.090\nis subject to much tighter\nrestrictions and projections and\n\n446\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.730\nusage laws than it would be if the data\nwas stored here in North America.\n\n447\n00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.710\nThat's a very,\nvery interesting dynamic for\n\n448\n00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.450\na cloud security professional\nto have to deal with, right?\n\n449\n00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:25.620\nBecause the reality is, where the data\nlives is where it is ultimately regulated.\n\n450\n00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.430\nAnd this brings up a very\ninteresting set of concerns for\n\n451\n00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:32.300\nboth cloud customers and cloud providers.\n\n452\n00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.810\nGeolocation, and\ngeopreferencing for data hosting.\n\n453\n00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:38.910\nIf you are a member of the government,\nwhether it's the United States government,\n\n454\n00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:42.380\nwhether it's the Greek government,\nwhether it is the French government,\n\n455\n00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.400\ntake your pick, any country in the world.\n\n456\n00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.165\nThose governments have gotten smart in\nrecent years and have said, you know,\n\n457\n00:22:48.165 --> 00:22:53.260\nif we're gonna consume cloud services and\nwe're gonna provide cloud services.\n\n458\n00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:56.450\nWe have to go to a third party if we\nwe're not gonna do it ourselves and\n\n459\n00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.330\nwe have to make it clear that\nthat third party cannot move our\n\n460\n00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.880\ndata outside the jurisdictional\nboundary of our country.\n\n461\n00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.400\nBecause if they do, in theory, that data\nmay be subject to somebody else's laws.\n\n462\n00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.290\nAnd so if the federal government\nof the United States hosts\n\n463\n00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:13.450\non a cloud providers platform,\nGoogle, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.\n\n464\n00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.010\nThey have built into their contracts\na geo preference clause for data.\n\n465\n00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:21.860\nThat data cannot leave the jurisdictional\nboundary of the United States, which means\n\n466\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:28.160\nMicrosoft cannot move that data outside\nof the US in their data center clouds.\n\n467\n00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.865\nThey can frame and host that data in one\nof the three acknowledged centers that\n\n468\n00:23:31.865 --> 00:23:35.229\nexist in the US, east coast,\ncentral, and essentially west coast.\n\n469\n00:23:35.229 --> 00:23:38.560\nBut they can't fill that data over to\nIreland, where their main data center is\n\n470\n00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.885\nin the EU for instance, or\nat least one of them anyway.\n\n471\n00:23:40.885 --> 00:23:45.280\nThey're not able to do that because\nthey're bound by contractual obligation to\n\n472\n00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.994\nkeep that data in the US\nbecause of constraints and\n\n473\n00:23:47.994 --> 00:23:51.224\nconcerns about the legalities\nthat may apply to that data,\n\n474\n00:23:51.224 --> 00:23:55.552\nor the inability to protect that data the\nsame way, and therefore to have to give\n\n475\n00:23:55.552 --> 00:23:58.750\nit to a third party,\nunder some sort of a discovery order.\n\n476\n00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.616\n>> Adam would the inverse also be true,\n\n477\n00:24:00.616 --> 00:24:04.407\nthat if I didn't want my country to be\nable to Look at my data, I would choose\n\n478\n00:24:04.407 --> 00:24:09.200\na datacenter that's outside of my country\nthat has more stringent protection.\n\n479\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.535\n>> So, interesting, so it may or may not,\nbut here's the challenge, right.\n\n480\n00:24:13.535 --> 00:24:16.928\nWe're still developing this law and\nessentially this thought process,\n\n481\n00:24:16.928 --> 00:24:17.810\nglobally as we go.\n\n482\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.980\nThere are many many standards, we'll\ntalk about them in upcoming episodes.\n\n483\n00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.750\nThere are ISO standards we have to\nbe aware of with regards to cloud,\n\n484\n00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.580\ncloud privacy, cloud security.\n\n485\n00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.650\nSo ISO 31000, for instance, with regards\nto standardized risk management.\n\n486\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.860\nThe ISO 27000 series with regards\nto information security overall.\n\n487\n00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.937\n27017 and 18 with regards to cloud\nsecurity and provisioning are new\n\n488\n00:24:38.937 --> 00:24:42.968\nstandards that have just come online\nwithin the last three or four months.\n\n489\n00:24:42.968 --> 00:24:47.320\nThere are NIST documents that are not\nrising to the same level as ISO standards,\n\n490\n00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:50.270\nbut are still incredibly important for\nus to reference.\n\n491\n00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.612\nThen there's standards for risk management\nlike the Risk Management Framework,\n\n492\n00:24:53.612 --> 00:24:57.670\nthe FedRAMP standards, the government\nstandards in the United States for\n\n493\n00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.720\ncloud and how cloud is\nessentially being provisioned.\n\n494\n00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.335\nSo being aware of lot of these things\nplays into this conversation, but\n\n495\n00:25:04.335 --> 00:25:06.430\nNIST documents are not laws, first of all.\n\n496\n00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:09.810\nThey are guidance, and they\nare recommended, but they're not enforced.\n\n497\n00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:12.520\nAt least the ones that speak to broad\n\n498\n00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.940\nthought processes are not\nenforced as laws.\n\n499\n00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:19.720\nThere are references to NIST\ndocuments such as NIST 853 R4,\n\n500\n00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.550\nwhich essentially provides\nthe control mechanisms for\n\n501\n00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.470\nthe federal government's implementation\nof their information security\n\n502\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.630\nmanagement infrastructure,\nreferencing the FIPS guidelines,\n\n503\n00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.280\nthe Federal Information Processing\nSecurity and standard guidelines.\n\n504\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.430\nSo there's cross-pollination there.\n\n505\n00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:38.420\nAnd those are ultimately implementing\ncontrol elements that are specified in\n\n506\n00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.930\nexecutive orders and documentation with\nregards to how to build infrastructure.\n\n507\n00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.750\nSo in the US,\nthey are seen as being guidance\n\n508\n00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.700\nthat is applicable under certain laws,\nbut globally, they're not laws.\n\n509\n00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.990\nThey are simply best\npractice recommendations.\n\n510\n00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.020\nSo there's a mixed bag, right,\nin other words, to think through this.\n\n511\n00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:59.470\nAnd so if you as a consumer say, well,\nI want to host my data, to your question,\n\n512\n00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:05.010\nright, in a place where maybe it will not\nbe as readily available to a government.\n\n513\n00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.490\nMaybe I don't somebody\nto see what I'm doing.\n\n514\n00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.035\nSo you can reference cases that\nhave occurred over the years.\n\n515\n00:26:10.035 --> 00:26:11.240\nThe Megaupload case,\n\n516\n00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.700\nwhich was one of the cases that really\ndealt with this, the Silk Road case,\n\n517\n00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.260\nwhich happened a couple years ago\nhere in the US with regards to or\n\n518\n00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:22.340\nat least was prosecuted here in the US\nwith regards to essentially this, right,\n\n519\n00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.440\npeople that are bad actors, not that all\npeople that want to hide what they're\n\n520\n00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.910\ndoing are bad actors by any means, but in\nboth these cases, there was questionable\n\n521\n00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.310\nactivity taking place in these cloud\nplatforms, let's put it that way.\n\n522\n00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.980\nAnd as a result of that,\nbecause of where they were hosted,\n\n523\n00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:41.150\nthere was questions about whether\ngovernments, not just the US government,\n\n524\n00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:45.600\nbut multiple governments who wanted to\nunderstand this activity, see this action,\n\n525\n00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.180\nand essentially get into it to find out\nwhat was going on, had the right or\n\n526\n00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.620\nthe ability to do so.\n\n527\n00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.400\nBoth those cases ended badly, essentially,\n[LAUGH] right, for the people involved,\n\n528\n00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.620\nbecause Megaupload as a cloud\nnetwork was taken down,\n\n529\n00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.910\nand they're still pursuing that case,\neven as we speak.\n\n530\n00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:04.773\nBut the ideas that the person behind that\nnetwork has got a world of troubles to\n\n531\n00:27:04.773 --> 00:27:09.054\ndeal with, because they essentially are\nbeing held hostage by multiple governments\n\n532\n00:27:09.054 --> 00:27:13.097\nwho wanna prosecute this person, and\nultimately the activities placed on their\n\n533\n00:27:13.097 --> 00:27:15.654\nnetwork with regards to\nviolated copyrights, and\n\n534\n00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:19.223\ninfringement of copyrights, and\nintellectual property controls for\n\n535\n00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:23.180\nsoftware, for movies, for music,\nyou name it, all sorts of stuff.\n\n536\n00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:26.286\nAnd with regards to Silk Road, both\nversions, because the first version that\n\n537\n00:27:26.286 --> 00:27:29.250\ncame went away, and the second iteration\nthat came back for a few months and\n\n538\n00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.370\nthen went away, were shut down by\nthe federal government ultimately.\n\n539\n00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.628\nBut there were problems associated with\nthat and there were criminal prosecutions\n\n540\n00:27:36.628 --> 00:27:39.669\nfor weapons dealing potentially,\nmoney laundering, and\n\n541\n00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:43.682\na host of potentially illegal and\nillicit activities that were taking place,\n\n542\n00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:48.360\nsupposedly, again, right, whether or\nnot that's the case on these networks.\n\n543\n00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.488\nAnd just because you put a network and\n\n544\n00:27:50.488 --> 00:27:54.744\njust because you put the cloud\ninfrastructure in a certain legal boundary\n\n545\n00:27:54.744 --> 00:27:59.600\ndoesn't always imply that you will be\nprotected to the full extent of the law.\n\n546\n00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.124\nWe have to understand that\nthe questions of privacy, and\n\n547\n00:28:02.124 --> 00:28:05.437\nthis is an age-old conversation,\nthis is not, hey, it's the cloud, so\n\n548\n00:28:05.437 --> 00:28:08.170\nsuddenly we throw everything\nwe know out the window.\n\n549\n00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:13.870\nThe question of balancing privacy\nversus the pursuit of illegal or\n\n550\n00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:17.700\nillicit activities and\nthe protection or lack thereof that\n\n551\n00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:23.150\nprivacy laws may afford you to engage in\nthose activities is an age-old struggle.\n\n552\n00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:28.690\nAnd without exception, pretty much,\nthroughout history, countries, companies,\n\n553\n00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:34.230\nentities, have always come down on\nthe side of, when we have at least\n\n554\n00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.940\ncompelling evidence that we think there\nis illicit or illegal activity going on,\n\n555\n00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.100\nyou don't have as many rights and\nyou're not afforded as many, if any,\n\n556\n00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.870\nprivacy protections that you may be under\nthe law normally when you appear and\n\n557\n00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.810\nindeed hopefully are acting legally.\n\n558\n00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:50.930\nIn other words, you are aligned,\nyou are following the legal requirements.\n\n559\n00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.860\nSo it's not as easy to say, well,\nif I just go host, right, in a third party\n\n560\n00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:58.350\ncountry where, essentially,\nthere's anonymous protections and\n\n561\n00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.170\nI can't be found, that I will be\nafforded protection under the law and\n\n562\n00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.870\nI can essentially do what I want.\n\n563\n00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:06.100\nDoing what I want is\na very broad statement.\n\n564\n00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.170\nWhat we really have to think about\nto answer the question is, if I am\n\n565\n00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:14.130\na law-abiding citizen, if I'm doing the\nright things and I host my data in a place\n\n566\n00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:19.030\nwhere I'm afforded a better set of privacy\nprotections, does that benefit me?\n\n567\n00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.740\nAnd the answer is, it can,\nbut here's a challenge.\n\n568\n00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.500\nSometimes it may be impossible and indeed\noften cases it is impossible for you\n\n569\n00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.830\nas an individual consumer to know where\nyour data is hosted on a cloud platform.\n\n570\n00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:33.785\nSo when you go in contract with Microsoft,\n\n571\n00:29:33.785 --> 00:29:36.940\nwhen you go in contract with Amazon\nas an individual private consumer,\n\n572\n00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.460\nnot a corporate customer willing to write\na very significant check to get geo\n\n573\n00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.530\npreference hosting of your data, you as\nan individual customer probably don't\n\n574\n00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.230\nhave any way of knowing whether your data\nlives in the boundary of North America or\n\n575\n00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.550\nwhether in certain situations it\nmaybe failed over to Europe, or\n\n576\n00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.040\nit may wind up being hosted in Europe and\nnot in North America at all.\n\n577\n00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.510\nNow, you can make arrangements\nto validate this and\n\n578\n00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.680\nultimately hard code this into\nyour contracts, let me be clear.\n\n579\n00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.420\nBut this takes money and it takes\na commitment to spending that money and\n\n580\n00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.070\nnegotiating with a provider to understand\nthat you have the right to ask this and\n\n581\n00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.672\nto find out what it will cost you.\n\n582\n00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:14.330\nAnd we're not talking about millions of\ndollars for an individual to do this,\n\n583\n00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.380\nbut there probably is a small\nadditional fee, and it may or\n\n584\n00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.020\nmay not be available for\nyou with all cloud platform plans.\n\n585\n00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.658\nIf you're consuming the $5 a month\nessentially email only plan with Microsoft\n\n586\n00:30:24.658 --> 00:30:29.634\nfor Office 365, you're not gonna probably\nhave the right to have geo preferencing\n\n587\n00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:31.738\nassociated with your hosting.\n\n588\n00:30:31.738 --> 00:30:34.810\nCuz for $5 a month, they're probably just\nnot interested in doing that for you.\n\n589\n00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:37.970\nBut if you're a business with\nan E4 enterprise agreement, or\n\n590\n00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.096\na government equivalent,\na G3 agreement for 30,\n\n591\n00:30:41.096 --> 00:30:44.830\n40 bucks a month per user, and\nyou're hosting thousands of users,\n\n592\n00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.980\nyou have the ability to specify through\nyour contract and your negotiation\n\n593\n00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.950\nthat you want your data to live in\na certain geographic preferenced area.\n\n594\n00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.000\nSo it may or may not be possible.\n\n595\n00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.790\nAnd for an individual,\nprobably hard to guarantee.\n\n596\n00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.925\nFor a business, it's certainly something\nthat I tell my customers when we deal with\n\n597\n00:31:01.925 --> 00:31:05.060\nrisk that we have to think about it and\nwe really have to be aware of, and\n\n598\n00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.770\nwe have to be on point with with regards\nto negotiating our cloud hosting\n\n599\n00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.730\nagreements with the between\nthe customer and the cloud provider.\n\n600\n00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.680\nWe have to ask, in other words, right,\nwhat the provider's stance is and\n\n601\n00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.620\nwhether they can guarantee\ngeo preferencing,\n\n602\n00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.790\nand if they can, under what terms and\nwhat circumstances?\n\n603\n00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.656\nAnd we want that in writing, by the way.\n\n604\n00:31:21.656 --> 00:31:25.256\nAs cloud security,\nas cloud certified security professionals,\n\n605\n00:31:25.256 --> 00:31:28.275\nwe want to make sure that we\nunderstand how to document as\n\n606\n00:31:28.275 --> 00:31:30.864\nmany of the risks that\nour customers will face.\n\n607\n00:31:30.864 --> 00:31:32.580\nIt's very very important.\n\n608\n00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.980\nImplied risk is still risk, right?\n\n609\n00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.630\nAnd implied capabilities are there.\n\n610\n00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:39.145\nBut we may or\nmay not understand them fully,\n\n611\n00:31:39.145 --> 00:31:41.860\ncuz they may not be\ndocumented appropriately.\n\n612\n00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.995\nAnd my interpretation of them may\ndiffer from the customer's, and\n\n613\n00:31:44.995 --> 00:31:46.590\nmay differ from the provider's.\n\n614\n00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:49.574\nAnd you don't want to get into that\nhe said, she said thing, right,\n\n615\n00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:53.229\nat some point where everybody's pointing\ntheir fingers at somebody, saying, but\n\n616\n00:31:53.229 --> 00:31:56.521\nyou said this, and ten months ago you\nsaid that, and you promised this, and\n\n617\n00:31:56.521 --> 00:31:58.762\nyou implied that There's\nno record of that right?\n\n618\n00:31:58.762 --> 00:32:03.610\nNobody's gonna remember and even if\nthey do if it's disadvantaging them in\n\n619\n00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:08.700\nsome way they're not gonna say, yeah,\nno I did promise that you're right.\n\n620\n00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:11.870\nLet's step back I owe you $1\nmillion because I screwed up here.\n\n621\n00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:13.830\nI mean you hope people do the right thing,\nbut\n\n622\n00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.650\nthe route is more often\nthan not they don't.\n\n623\n00:32:15.650 --> 00:32:19.530\nNot when it costs them money, at least not\nnormally anyway, that's my experience.\n\n624\n00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.870\nSo as a result, we really as cloud\nprofessionals have to understand that we\n\n625\n00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:23.800\nhave to get everything up front.\n\n626\n00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.800\nIf we don't document everything, if it's\nnot written down and it's not agreed to,\n\n627\n00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.060\nas far as I'm concerned and\nI tell my customers, it doesn't exist.\n\n628\n00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.810\nSo if you have a hosting agreement, great.\n\n629\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:36.510\nWe're going by what's in that agreement\ncuz that's what the provider's gonna hold\n\n630\n00:32:36.510 --> 00:32:37.720\nus accountable to.\n\n631\n00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.570\nAnd if it's in there, we can enforce it.\n\n632\n00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.660\nIf it's not, we can ask,\nand we can be polite, and\n\n633\n00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.120\nwe can hope, but you know, chances\nare good it's probably not gonna occur.\n\n634\n00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.300\nAt least not normally anyway.\n\n635\n00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.370\nSo, want to be thinking\nabout these things, right?\n\n636\n00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:53.260\n>> And even if the provider aquiesses\nto something that you're asking for\n\n637\n00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:54.560\nthat's not in your agreement,\n\n638\n00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.030\nit doesn't mean that they're\ngoing to do that all the time.\n\n639\n00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:59.800\nJust because they did it this\ntime doesn't set the rule,\n\n640\n00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.670\nbecause it doesn't become\npart of your agreement.\n\n641\n00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.560\n>> It may not create the expectation that\nit's going to become part, right, exactly.\n\n642\n00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.520\nIncorporated into a standardized\nway in which things are done.\n\n643\n00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.510\nThere may be exceptions.\n\n644\n00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.000\nWe manage by them all the time.\n\n645\n00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.700\nBut the reality is you can't\nmanage your world by exception.\n\n646\n00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.750\nI tell my customers this all\nthe time with regards to risk.\n\n647\n00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.590\nJust cuz you got lucky and avoided it\nthis time, unless you plan for it,\n\n648\n00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:21.970\nyou're not gonna get lucky every time.\n\n649\n00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:26.240\nIf you did, then we'd all have islands\nsomewhere, we'd all be retired and\n\n650\n00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.940\nnobody would have to work for a living,\nso we all want to hit the lottery.\n\n651\n00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.240\nlast time i check anyway\nit hadn't happen for\n\n652\n00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.210\nme which is why I'm here\ntalking to you now.\n\n653\n00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:36.130\nRight so\nreality is you know look it is what it is.\n\n654\n00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:40.620\nWe have to plan and I often talk about it\nin many of the shows that I spend time\n\n655\n00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.840\ntalking to you about I always tell my\ncustomers, I always tell my students.\n\n656\n00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.660\nYou have to plan to be successful or\nyou have to plan to fail.\n\n657\n00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.880\nThe choice is yours.\n\n658\n00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.040\nYou choose which.\n\n659\n00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.680\nBut if you are not\nplanning to be successful,\n\n660\n00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.990\nby implied consent you\nare planning to fail.\n\n661\n00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.940\nYou just don't realize it.\n\n662\n00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:01.960\nBecause unless you go out of your way to\nensure to your point that we write these\n\n663\n00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.580\nthings down, we document them,\nas I was saying, and\n\n664\n00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:09.390\nwe have in writing what the expectations\nand the commitments are.\n\n665\n00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:13.610\nWe have no way of holding that provider\naccountable, and as a result of that,\n\n666\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.880\nat best they may feel it's okay to do\nit because they're in a good mood.\n\n667\n00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.090\nBut they can also come back and\nsay absolutely not, spend more money,\n\n668\n00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:23.930\nrenegotiate your contract,\nuntil then we're just not interested.\n\n669\n00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:25.200\nThat's an issue.\n\n670\n00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:29.470\nWe've talked, just quickly before\nwe wrap up, about IaaS PAS and SAS.\n\n671\n00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:31.960\nI've essentially defined\nthe three service models for you.\n\n672\n00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.910\nI wanted also quickly to find\nthe four hosting models,\n\n673\n00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:36.890\nthe deployment models\nthat essentially exist.\n\n674\n00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:39.050\nWe've talked about them\nin the prior episode,\n\n675\n00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.430\nbut I want to give you\na quick definition of them.\n\n676\n00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:43.810\nThe private, the hybrid, the public,\nand the community cloud.\n\n677\n00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:47.240\nJust so we have a sense, and\nwe kind of lay down the bedrock of them.\n\n678\n00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.529\nCan we throw back up the NIST 800-145?\n\n679\n00:34:49.529 --> 00:34:51.840\nGood, good man, had that already set up.\n\n680\n00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.830\nI love working with professionals.\n\n681\n00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.010\nUnlike that Mike character, that crazy\nguy I'm always stuck working with,\n\n682\n00:34:57.010 --> 00:34:59.370\nwho's never ever got the right\nthing up on the screen.\n\n683\n00:34:59.370 --> 00:34:59.910\nI'm only kidding.\n\n684\n00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:00.900\nMike's a great guy.\n\n685\n00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.930\nGreat host, and does,\n\n686\n00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:04.910\nas you've seen if you've seen some of our\nshows does some really great work for\n\n687\n00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:08.160\nme as well, but I'm fortunate to spend\nthis week with Daniel talking about\n\n688\n00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.930\ncloud with you guys, and he's got the four\ndeployment models up on the guide.\n\n689\n00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:15.100\nNow, remember, we got these\nfrom the NIST 800-145 document.\n\n690\n00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:19.110\nThis is that short seven,\nnine page cloud summary document.\n\n691\n00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:21.430\nWe've also talked about NIST 800-146,\n\n692\n00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.380\nthe big 90 some odd page summary\ndocument that rolls all this up.\n\n693\n00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.950\nSo when we talk about deployment models,\nwe've got the private cloud.\n\n694\n00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.400\nWe'll go in the order\nthey are in the document.\n\n695\n00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.910\nWe've got the private cloud there.\n\n696\n00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.800\nRemember, private cloud\nis essentially owned or\n\n697\n00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.490\nleased by a single company or entity.\n\n698\n00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.520\nIt is managed exclusively for them.\n\n699\n00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.560\nEssentially this could be a private on\nprem cloud, managed provision, then\n\n700\n00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.210\nessentially consumed in service by the IT\nfunction of the business for the business.\n\n701\n00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.460\nAnd this also, and\npeople often forget this,\n\n702\n00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.300\ncould be the IT function in\na multi-national business, right?\n\n703\n00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.360\nMultiple business units all\nover the world providing\n\n704\n00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.020\ncloud services to those business units.\n\n705\n00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.140\nBut again, privately,\ninternally for the company.\n\n706\n00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.170\nso you could essentially become\nan outsource cloud provider\n\n707\n00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:08.200\nof private IT services as a central IT\narm to a multi-national business but\n\n708\n00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.030\nit would all be private,\nit would all be internal across the world.\n\n709\n00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.640\nSo private cloud can be internal or\nit can be\n\n710\n00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.640\nhosted with a third party company like\nAmazon, like Google and you can contract\n\n711\n00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.170\nin a multi-tenant environment to have\nunique infrastructure dedicated to you.\n\n712\n00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.570\nBut it's dedicated to your company only,\nthat's private.\n\n713\n00:36:26.570 --> 00:36:29.240\nThe community cloud is a cloud,\nnumber one,\n\n714\n00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.620\na cloud deployment model that\nmost people don't realize exists.\n\n715\n00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.970\nSo when you're studying for the exam,\nmake sure you know all four of these.\n\n716\n00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:37.870\nNumber two,\nhave a one-sentence working definition.\n\n717\n00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.990\nA community cloud is a cloud that is\nshared by multiple groups that share\n\n718\n00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:42.130\na common interest.\n\n719\n00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.830\nSo it's like a private cloud.\n\n720\n00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:47.610\nBut it's uniquely tailored to a certain\nset of groups within the private cloud.\n\n721\n00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:52.020\nSo I often tell my customers it is like\nhave a subset of the private cloud.\n\n722\n00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.050\nIt's like having a private\ncloud within the private cloud.\n\n723\n00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:57.590\nBut a private cloud,\nuniquely tailored to one group, so\n\n724\n00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:02.000\nif you have sales and marketing\nwithin your company, if you have HR,\n\n725\n00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.825\nwhich most companies do as an area line of\nbusiness, right, if you have HR sales and\n\n726\n00:37:06.825 --> 00:37:10.505\nmarketing and\nthey need a cloud specific to their needs.\n\n727\n00:37:10.505 --> 00:37:13.465\nIn the broader context of\nthe corporate private cloud,\n\n728\n00:37:13.465 --> 00:37:15.525\nyou may set up a subsection of that cloud,\n\n729\n00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:19.922\nbreak it off, constrain it, access control\nit just for those individuals in HR,\n\n730\n00:37:19.922 --> 00:37:24.272\nthat would be a community cloud, shared by\nthose people, but only available to them.\n\n731\n00:37:24.272 --> 00:37:25.762\nIt's a subset of the private cloud,\n\n732\n00:37:25.762 --> 00:37:28.512\nessentially with an interest\ngroup associated with it.\n\n733\n00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:30.252\nThen we have the public cloud.\n\n734\n00:37:30.252 --> 00:37:32.632\nThe public cloud is going to be,\nas I said, think of the Internet.\n\n735\n00:37:32.632 --> 00:37:34.362\nThink of the worldwide web.\n\n736\n00:37:34.362 --> 00:37:37.042\nLarge cloud infrastructure\navailable to anybody, or\n\n737\n00:37:37.042 --> 00:37:39.192\nalmost anybody, without exception.\n\n738\n00:37:39.192 --> 00:37:41.812\nAll you have to do is essentially just\nconnect to the network in order to see\n\n739\n00:37:41.812 --> 00:37:45.560\nthe cloud, usually not even requiring\nan access account, although,\n\n740\n00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.970\nyou may have to register even though\nregistering doesn't imply spending money,\n\n741\n00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:50.750\nbut simply creating an account.\n\n742\n00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.330\nYou may or may not have this, I know.\n\n743\n00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.630\nI've had mine for years.\n\n744\n00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:56.280\nHow many of us have a Windows Live ID or\n\n745\n00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.260\na Microsoft account on Hotmail or\nsomething like that?\n\n746\n00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:03.190\nThat's used to access all sorts of public\ncloud environments for Microsoft but\n\n747\n00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.510\nalso some private ones.\n\n748\n00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:07.560\nAnd when we join those two together, we\nhave what's known as a hybrid cloud right.\n\n749\n00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:12.400\nAnd the hybrid cloud is going to be two\nof the three other cloud models, public,\n\n750\n00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.860\nprivate and/or community.\n\n751\n00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.890\nRemember we don't want\nto forget community.\n\n752\n00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.000\nTwo of those joined together to give\nus the ability to have both sides.\n\n753\n00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.430\nEither public and private.\n\n754\n00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:22.790\nPrivate and community.\n\n755\n00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.420\nCommunity and public.\n\n756\n00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.980\nHowever you do that but\nit's two cloud models joined together, and\n\n757\n00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.620\nessentially some sort of common front end\nthat's provided for you to access it.\n\n758\n00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:33.320\nSo think of a banking site.\n\n759\n00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.690\nThink of going to the Amazon retail site.\n\n760\n00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:39.730\nThe portion you can browse without logging\nin is the public side of the cloud, right.\n\n761\n00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.270\nAnd then the portion that when you log in\nas an individual customer, you'll have\n\n762\n00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:48.340\naccess to your customer records,\nyour order history, all that kinda stuff.\n\n763\n00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.770\nThat's part of the private cloud.\n\n764\n00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.900\nAnd when we join those two together,\nwe have a hybrid, right.\n\n765\n00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.400\nOkay.\n>> Awesome.\n\n766\n00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.540\nWe have definitely got\n\n767\n00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.710\na lot of information out of this episode.\n\n768\n00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.940\nThis is definitely, it's a lot of\ncomplexity when it comes to getting into\n\n769\n00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:04.860\ncloud services, especially when we're\ntrying to secure those cloud services,\n\n770\n00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.290\nwhich is obviously what we're going\nto get into here very, very shortly.\n\n771\n00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.520\nBut, Adam, we thank you for dropping by.\n\n772\n00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:14.050\nWe thank you for helping us understand\nthat that is a very complex subject and\n\n773\n00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.290\nthat we need to-\n>> A little bit complex.\n\n774\n00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.250\n>> Yeah, just a hair.\n\n775\n00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:20.150\nAnd that we need to come at it with that\nlevel of complexity, understanding, and\n\n776\n00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.350\nif we don't have these foundational\nknowledges locked down in the brain,\n\n777\n00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.720\nready to rock, we're not gonna be able\nto work with them effectively and\n\n778\n00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.990\neffectively secure them.\n\n779\n00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.580\nBut looks like our time has run out for\nthis episode.\n\n780\n00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.680\nWe've got plenty more to go.\n\n781\n00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:34.070\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n782\n00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.490\nWe do thank you guys for stopping by.\n\n783\n00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.460\nWe thank you again, Adam, for stopping by.\n\n784\n00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.440\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n785\n00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:41.760\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n786\n00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.440\n>> I am not Daniel Lowry, but\nI am somebody who knows about cloud.\n\n787\n00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.455\n>> That's Adam Gordon.\n\n788\n00:39:45.455 --> 00:39:48.581\n[LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n789\n00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:56.160\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:19.940\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we're continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.120\nour certified cloud security professional\nseries that we've been working on.\n\n5\n00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.368\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nfor part three is our good friend Mr.\n\n6\n00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:27.890\nAdam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.460\nAdam, welcome back to the show,\nhow is it going?\n\n8\n00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.680\n>> Howdy everybody it's good, it's good.\n\n9\n00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.730\nIt's a little rainy,\nchance of clouds in the cloud discussion.\n\n10\n00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.180\nThat's redundant I know but\nclouds with clouds.\n\n11\n00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.700\nWe're gonna talk about that\nconcept at some point too.\n\n12\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.170\nSo we are gonna talk about\nsome interesting things.\n\n13\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.880\nNot that we haven't been talking about\ninteresting things already cuz everything\n\n14\n00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.070\nDaniel says is interesting.\n\n15\n00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.790\nAt least, that's what he tells me\noff camera when nobody's around.\n\n16\n00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.340\nBut what we are gonna do is continue\ntalking about some of the building blocks.\n\n17\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.540\nTheme that we've kinda had for\n\n18\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.170\nthe first couple of episodes has\nbeen what are the building blocks.\n\n19\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.390\nWhat's the knowledge we need to have?\n\n20\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.230\nWhat are the service models?\n\n21\n00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.530\nWhat are the deployment models?\n\n22\n00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.230\nWhat are the legal ramifications of cloud?\n\n23\n00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.790\nWhat are the definition of the cloud\nresources, the five characteristics,\n\n24\n00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.460\nright, that we need?\n\n25\n00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.750\nWe've talked about all that stuff.\n\n26\n00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.470\nWhat we haven't talked about, and what's\nreally also very important to put into\n\n27\n00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.510\nthe mix, are all the roles that\ncloud providers, cloud customers,\n\n28\n00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.160\ncloud architects, cloud administrators\nhave to inhabit, and how we define those.\n\n29\n00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.547\nAnd Daniel's helped me out to put together\nactually, a really cool little list of\n\n30\n00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:28.090\nthose roles, definitions, and a nice\ngraphic to summarize them all for you.\n\n31\n00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.970\nSo if we could put that up real\nquick we're gonna take a look at it.\n\n32\n00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.740\nI think we may wanna zoom\nin just a little bit, so\n\n33\n00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.110\nwe'll do that and just adjust the screen\nthere so you guys can see that.\n\n34\n00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.930\nYeah, I was going to say, going to\nhave to go a little bit bigger for\n\n35\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.290\nme to see because I can't\nactually see what we're on.\n\n36\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.080\nThat's cloud based service provider.\n\n37\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.740\nOkay, Cloud backup\nsearch provider I think.\n\n38\n00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.610\nI'm struggling to see,\nthat's my tired old eyes there.\n\n39\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.390\nThat's good I can see that, I have it in\norder so I think we can just go down.\n\n40\n00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.370\nIf you want to zoom out just enough so\nwe can see it.\n\n41\n00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.920\nPerfect and that way, yeah.\n\n42\n00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.130\nThat way they could just\nsee the definition.\n\n43\n00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.240\nWe'll just roll down and I've got.\n\n44\n00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.660\nYou know what I mean.\n\n45\n00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.330\n>> You've got the list.\n\n46\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.860\n>> Very, that's what I was gonna say.\n\n47\n00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.180\nI have it in front of me too, so\nI can keep track of where we are.\n\n48\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.830\nThat's not a problem.\n\n49\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.670\nSo let's talk about some of\nthe functional roles, the descriptions\n\n50\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.030\nof the things that the ecosystem of\nthe cloud is gonna be made up of.\n\n51\n00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.140\nThese are the players and\n\n52\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.430\nthese are the pieces of the puzzle\nthat they actually bring to the table.\n\n53\n00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.850\nSo cloud backup service provider\nis gonna be more often than not\n\n54\n00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.030\nsome sort of third party\nentity that's gonna help us to\n\n55\n00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.480\nreally deal with the operational\nresponsibilities of the cloud.\n\n56\n00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.470\nBut specifically, operational\nresponsibilities with regards to data\n\n57\n00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.560\nsecurity from a backup and\na recovery perspective.\n\n58\n00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.010\nSo, one of the key things that we talked\nabout, and you actually had drawn our\n\n59\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.380\nattention to this, right, Daniel, in our\nprior episode and the prior conversation.\n\n60\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.560\nAbout, hey if we think about\nthe responsibilities of the customer and\n\n61\n00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.370\nthe provider, and we flip the roles.\n\n62\n00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.470\nWhat happens, are we as secure?\n\n63\n00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.480\nHow does that all play out?\n\n64\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.330\nWho's responsible for what?\n\n65\n00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.700\nAnd I went through and talked about\nISS and passed, kind of laid out for\n\n66\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.490\nyou what the customer and\nwhat the provider are gonna do,\n\n67\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.755\nwhere that demarcation line is for\nresponsibility.\n\n68\n00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:07.705\nOne of the things we called out\nclearly is that in the SAS model,\n\n69\n00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:11.215\nthe SAS provider, the cloud service\nprovider is gonna be responsible for\n\n70\n00:03:11.215 --> 00:03:14.305\nbacking up the data that\nthe customer puts in.\n\n71\n00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:18.715\nWe said the customer is essentially gonna\nprovide user account management and\n\n72\n00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:22.465\nis gonna provide data either through\nupload and or through creation or\n\n73\n00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:25.215\nmodification, and\nthat the provider does everything else.\n\n74\n00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:28.930\nAnd so the cloud backup service\nprovider would be a role that in a SAS\n\n75\n00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.350\nmodel the service provider\nwould have to fulfill.\n\n76\n00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.680\nBecause that service provider is gonna\nhave to make sure that from a BCDR,\n\n77\n00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.750\nBusiness Continuity Disaster Recovery\nperspective, our data is being manage,\n\n78\n00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.100\nmaintained and available for not only some\nsort of a disaster event but just for\n\n79\n00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.070\nsimple average everyday things.\n\n80\n00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.700\nWe have to do a brick level restore of an\nindividual file or an individual table, or\n\n81\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.880\nrecord, or you know,\nsomething in the database.\n\n82\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.790\nAll the way to, hey, we lost the whole\nsystem, we've got to essentially restart\n\n83\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.380\nand reboot everything, and we've got\nto reprovision all that data, put it\n\n84\n00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.280\nall back in, that's all going to be what\nthe cloud backup service provider does.\n\n85\n00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.320\nThis is typically a service that\nis provided essentially for\n\n86\n00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.390\nmultiple customers in the data center.\n\n87\n00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.460\nSo think of a hosting model, an ISP based\nsolution, you're buying this kind of\n\n88\n00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.570\nservice or at least provisioning\nas part of the service hosting.\n\n89\n00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.500\nThe Cloud computing reseller,\nas we work down the list,\n\n90\n00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.970\nthis is gonna be a company that\nacts as a middle man, right?\n\n91\n00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.922\nWe often will, in the Cloud, deal with\nan upfront solution provider of some kind,\n\n92\n00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:33.878\nbut they maybe the actual service provider\nor they may actually simply be reselling\n\n93\n00:04:33.878 --> 00:04:38.860\nthose services much like many other areas\nthat we are familiar with and we know.\n\n94\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.650\nWe don't buy direct in\nother words all the time.\n\n95\n00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.350\nSometimes we buy indirectly.\n\n96\n00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.800\nAnd so what we're doing is we're going\nto this particular third party and\n\n97\n00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.540\nthis company purchases hosting services\nfrom a cloud service hosting company or\n\n98\n00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.270\nsome sort of cloud computing provider and\nthen resells them out to their customers,\n\n99\n00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.640\nwhether as a rebranding or\nsimply under the name.\n\n100\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.540\nI'm a Verizon authorized reseller,\nI'm an Amazon reseller, whatever it is.\n\n101\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.490\nOr I'm selling you my service when in\nfact my service is a labeled offering\n\n102\n00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.800\nthat is going to be repackaged from\none of the big tier providers.\n\n103\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.920\nYou know, we've seen this for years in the\ncellular industry for instance, right, and\n\n104\n00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.640\ngenerically also in the telecommunications\nindustry, when you buy bandwidth or\n\n105\n00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.280\nbuy infrastructure, you're really renting\nit from a tier one or tier two or\n\n106\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.410\ntier three provider, and those lower\ntier providers are essentially reselling\n\n107\n00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.870\ncapabilities and bandwidth off\nof a tier one provider's core.\n\n108\n00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.810\nAnd so everybody used to buy from MCI,\nwhen MCI was around years ago,\n\n109\n00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.860\nbecause MCI owned most\nof the infrastructure,\n\n110\n00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.840\nand essentially just repackaged it and\nsold the rights to it.\n\n111\n00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.770\nSo they would eventually let you sub\nlease it three or four providers down.\n\n112\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.320\n>> That's funny you bring up that essay,\nan example, I actually had a friend in\n\n113\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.910\nhigh school, what he did was he bought a\nhigh speed line and he sold dial-up keys.\n\n114\n00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:51.810\n>> Carved it up and-\n>> Yeah,\n\n115\n00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.220\ncarved it up and became his own little ISP\nin a rural area and made money that way.\n\n116\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.670\nHe was reselling access to that line.\n\n117\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.430\n>> I went to college, as many of us did,\n\n118\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.480\ndepending on when you went to college\nyears ago if you are of a certain age.\n\n119\n00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.060\nI went to college with many people who\npracticed this informally when they would\n\n120\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.110\nbuy cable, one person would in\nthe housing area you lived in,\n\n121\n00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.639\nand everybody else would simply\nborrow that cable [LAUGH] right.\n\n122\n00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so you would,\n\n123\n00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.110\nnot that it's legal by the way,\nwant to make sure, that's not good,\n\n124\n00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.000\nshouldn't do that.\n\n125\n00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.830\nBut many people would essentially\ntap into that cable line, and\n\n126\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.070\nborrow that signal, right.\n\n127\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.220\nSo everybody had crappy reception,\n\n128\n00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.670\nas opposed to one person having\nreally good reception, because\n\n129\n00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.590\nthose days you didn't really understand\nthat when you tapped into a cable line and\n\n130\n00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.070\nbled the signal off, you lost signal\ncontinuity and quality, right.\n\n131\n00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.840\nThe signal through attenuation would\nessentially degrade very quickly.\n\n132\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.660\nSo everybody watched\n\n133\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.950\na little bit of cable but-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n134\n00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.979\n>> 25 people had one cable system they\n\n135\n00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:40.900\nwere all using.\n\n136\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.820\nIt's the same kind of thing.\n\n137\n00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.520\nRight?\nCloud computing reseller.\n\n138\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.360\nSo a cloud customer.\n\n139\n00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.010\nRight when we talk about a cloud customer,\nthat's the easy one.\n\n140\n00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.170\nThat's you buying a cloud service or\n\n141\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.850\nconsuming a cloud service from\nwhoever you are buying it from.\n\n142\n00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.270\nWhether it's the reseller.\n\n143\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.700\nWhether it's the cloud\nback up service provider.\n\n144\n00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.880\nWhether it's going to be some\nsort of a main line company.\n\n145\n00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.000\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Google,\nwhoever those players are.\n\n146\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.450\nThat could be a private,\ninternal cloud from the business.\n\n147\n00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.710\nSo the IT function of the business\ncan be the cloud provider, and\n\n148\n00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.190\nthe cloud customer can be the business.\n\n149\n00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.700\nWe are providing and consuming on\nthe same side of the divide there.\n\n150\n00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.370\nLots of different ways to see that, but\n\n151\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.430\nthe cloud consumer's\nessentially that entity.\n\n152\n00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.340\nPerson, individual, company,\netc., that utilizes or\n\n153\n00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.330\nsubscribes to the cloud based serviced,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n154\n00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.060\nThe Cloud services auditor, this is gonna\nbe a third party organization again.\n\n155\n00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.205\nWe may have these internal function\nthrough our internal risk management,\n\n156\n00:07:35.205 --> 00:07:38.210\nour internal governance for\ncompliance capability so\n\n157\n00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.160\nwe may very well have\nan internal audit arm.\n\n158\n00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.740\nMany big companies do.\n\n159\n00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.471\nI don't know if where\nyou were working before.\n\n160\n00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:45.511\nWhen you and I were chatting.\n\n161\n00:07:45.511 --> 00:07:47.140\n>> Yeah.\n>> I would think that probably would have\n\n162\n00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.320\nhad an internal audit function\ngiven the kinda work they do.\n\n163\n00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.969\nBut the reality is some\ncompanies do some don’t.\n\n164\n00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:54.860\nSo if you have an internal function,\n\n165\n00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.429\nyou could certainly be\nauditing Cloud services.\n\n166\n00:07:57.429 --> 00:08:01.564\nBut we think about the formal definition\nof a Cloud service auditor We think\n\n167\n00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:06.357\ntraditionally of a third-party, external\nto the business, force that comes in, or\n\n168\n00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:10.428\na source of that audit that will come in,\nverifying attainment of SLAs and\n\n169\n00:08:10.428 --> 00:08:13.080\nattestation of controls\nthat are put in place.\n\n170\n00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.175\nEssentially they're the ones\nto keep us honest, right.\n\n171\n00:08:15.175 --> 00:08:19.945\nThey come in they tell us what we're doing\nand validate for us and for the auditor\n\n172\n00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:23.495\nwill look at both the customer side and\nthe provider side and make sure that both\n\n173\n00:08:23.495 --> 00:08:27.565\nparties are acting equitably and living\nup to their commitments under their SLA.\n\n174\n00:08:27.565 --> 00:08:31.455\nBut again, typically done from the\noutside, from a third party perspective.\n\n175\n00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:34.415\nThe reason I'm stressing that is\nthat there's a difference between\n\n176\n00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:37.430\nwhat you may see in\nthe real world referred to.\n\n177\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.710\nAnd what you actually should\nknow is the standard or official\n\n178\n00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.930\ndefinition of this term with regards\nto let's say exam preparation, right?\n\n179\n00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.840\nIn the real world, I see outside\nall the time as I was mentioning,\n\n180\n00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.950\naudit capabilities being brought to bear\nfor the internal to the organization\n\n181\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.920\nbeing discussed over the concept of\na cloud service auditing function.\n\n182\n00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.460\nBut the reality is it's an internal audit.\n\n183\n00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.680\nAnd it is not a full cloud service audit\nbecause if you're auditing a third party\n\n184\n00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.785\ncloud service provider,\n\n185\n00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:08.980\nan ISP, you typically do that as\nan external party to the contract\n\n186\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.345\nbecause that way you have the ability to\nask questions on both sides and validate.\n\n187\n00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:15.845\nIt's very hard to do that when you're\nthe customer holding half the cards and\n\n188\n00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:18.275\nthen expect the provider\nto fess up as to whether or\n\n189\n00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:20.275\nnot they're acting\naccording to the contract.\n\n190\n00:09:20.275 --> 00:09:23.095\nSo we tend to see that\nas an external function.\n\n191\n00:09:23.095 --> 00:09:27.765\nWe have the cloud services brokerage,\nor what's called the CSB.\n\n192\n00:09:27.765 --> 00:09:29.035\nSo the cloud service broker or\n\n193\n00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:33.955\nthe cloud services brokerage is the idea\nof a third-party company that will come in\n\n194\n00:09:33.955 --> 00:09:39.060\nand play on their our relationship and\ntheir ability to provide services.\n\n195\n00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.920\nAnd to act as,\neither a middleman or some sort of\n\n196\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.780\nvalue added re seller that is going to be\nable to offer additional cloud services or\n\n197\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.820\namp up, if you will, or\nsomehow provide additional capabilities\n\n198\n00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.750\nto that cloud platform that\nyou are already consuming.\n\n199\n00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.680\nThey tend to do business with multiple\nCSP's, Cloud Service Providers, and\n\n200\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.690\nas a result, can offer a menu of services,\nso you may be able to choose from a common\n\n201\n00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.950\nprovider that can sell you services\nacross multiple platforms, for instance.\n\n202\n00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.960\nMaybe the CDWs of the world,\nmaybe the Dells of the world, right?\n\n203\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.620\nThe lars or the vars in the cloud space\n\n204\n00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.830\nthat essentially are able to\nrepresent multiple businesses and\n\n205\n00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.550\nprovide multiple lines of service\nfall into the CSB category.\n\n206\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.330\nThat's more or less what we would see\na lot of the times, they help you select\n\n207\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.690\nthe best or most appropriate cloud\nprovider and service package.\n\n208\n00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.749\nSo they're offering guidance as\nwell as essentially monitoring and\n\n209\n00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:36.110\nvalue-added capabilities.\n\n210\n00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.260\nCSP we've talked about,\nthis is a Cloud Service Provider.\n\n211\n00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.840\nTraditionally, this is the Microsoft,\nthe Google,\n\n212\n00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.040\nthe Amazon company you\nare buying Cloud services from.\n\n213\n00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.960\nWhoever, whatever they may be.\n\n214\n00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.300\nAnd they are going to sell for\na fee to a client or\n\n215\n00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.880\na customer a service, or\na package of services.\n\n216\n00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.070\nAnd those are gonna be consumed,\n\n217\n00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:59.110\nas we say there at the end of\nthe definition, as a service.\n\n218\n00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:00.630\nAnd that's essentially\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n219\n00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.370\nRemember, anything can be\nconsumed as a service.\n\n220\n00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:05.960\nWe actually have an as for\nservice acronym for that.\n\n221\n00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.690\nXAAS, something or\nanything as a service, essentially,\n\n222\n00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.910\nrepresents the generic concept of any and\neverything today being service enabled.\n\n223\n00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.129\nSo that's just something to be\nconsider and be aware as well.\n\n224\n00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:22.450\nCloud Administrator, Cloud Administrator\nis going to be that individual role or\n\n225\n00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:26.870\nthat unique individual or group of\nindividuals that are responsible to\n\n226\n00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.315\nmanage and maintain the infrastructure\nthat we are consuming.\n\n227\n00:11:30.315 --> 00:11:34.715\nAs a cloud service customer\nand/or on the side of the ISP\n\n228\n00:11:34.715 --> 00:11:36.655\nthat we are providing to our customers,\nright?\n\n229\n00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:37.495\nBecause remember,\n\n230\n00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:40.605\nwe may be in the business of\nproviding private on-prem cloud.\n\n231\n00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:44.462\nWe may be in the business as a customer\nconsuming an off-prem solution\n\n232\n00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:46.442\nthrough a service relationship.\n\n233\n00:11:46.442 --> 00:11:49.642\nSo the cloud administrator is\ngonna be that entity, that person,\n\n234\n00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:53.972\nthat role, that is going to\noversee that particular solution.\n\n235\n00:11:53.972 --> 00:11:56.682\nYou may wanna just go\nup just a little bit.\n\n236\n00:11:56.682 --> 00:11:57.372\nIs that the bottom one?\n\n237\n00:11:57.372 --> 00:11:58.322\n>> Yeah, I'm at the bottom.\n\n238\n00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:01.112\n>> It's just I think I'm cutting off\nthe very end of the definitions.\n\n239\n00:12:01.112 --> 00:12:01.652\n>> There we go.\n\n240\n00:12:01.652 --> 00:12:04.210\n>> Yeah, it's just I think I'm\ncutting off part of the definition.\n\n241\n00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.540\nSo you see like every fourth word.\n\n242\n00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.800\n>> Down the way, Adam.\n\n243\n00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.110\n>> He was saying something,\nbut I can't see what it is.\n\n244\n00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.870\nAll right, so\nnow that I've put on my visibility cloak,\n\n245\n00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.010\nyou can see there it's probably a lot\neasier to see, thank you very much.\n\n246\n00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.880\nSo you can see this individual\nis typically responsible for\n\n247\n00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:20.860\nthe implementation, monitoring and\nmaintenance of the cloud,\n\n248\n00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.620\nwithin an organization, or\non behalf of that organization.\n\n249\n00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.700\nSo, I just want to make\nsure we're clear on that.\n\n250\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.610\nAnd we understand that that\ncan happen in either place.\n\n251\n00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:30.460\nI think we have a second, yeah,\nI was gonna say a second tab, right?\n\n252\n00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.230\nSo we have the cloud\napplication architect up there.\n\n253\n00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.970\nThis is gonna be a person, again.\n\n254\n00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.210\nRemember we don't typically assign a name,\nthis is a role.\n\n255\n00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.900\nWe just simply say Daniel may be in\nthis role, but tomorrow it could be Joe.\n\n256\n00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.930\nAnd so we're talking about a role,\nnot an individual traditionally.\n\n257\n00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.220\nSo this person, this entity, right,\nor rather excuse me, this person or\n\n258\n00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.720\nthis role,\nthe Cloud Application Architect,\n\n259\n00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.460\nthey're gonna be responsible for dealing\nwith how to port, maintain, provision and\n\n260\n00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:57.460\nultimately manage applications that\nare gonna be used in the cloud.\n\n261\n00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.400\nA lot of our main line\nbusiness application started\n\n262\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.430\nout especially in major companies\nthat have been around a long time.\n\n263\n00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.540\nStarted out life prior to the Cloud,\nand they may have been around for many,\n\n264\n00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:07.760\nmany years in this case.\n\n265\n00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.420\nYou know,\nCloud is a relatively new phenomenon.\n\n266\n00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.180\nWe talk about it as if it's been here\nforever, but it's really only been a model\n\n267\n00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.640\nthat we've dealt with probably for the\nlast decade at the most, depending on how\n\n268\n00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.410\nyou define the Cloud and where you may\nsee it becoming commercially available.\n\n269\n00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.490\nIt's a relatively new phenomenon.\n\n270\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.360\nDatabases have been around four or five\ntimes longer than the Cloud has been, for\n\n271\n00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.830\ninstance when we think\nabout a span of time.\n\n272\n00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.600\nCell phones have been around three or\nfour times longer, in one form or\n\n273\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.480\nanother, than Clouds have been,\nif you think about the span of time.\n\n274\n00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.900\nThat the concept defined as we\ncurrently understand it today\n\n275\n00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.510\nof cloud has been around.\n\n276\n00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.390\nAnd as a result of that, a lot of\nthese applications that we use and\n\n277\n00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.050\nconsume were not designed\nto be scaled to the cloud.\n\n278\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.190\nAnd so they have to be essentially\nmassaged, and coordinated,\n\n279\n00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.060\nand redefined and\narchitected to run in the cloud.\n\n280\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.590\nA lot of them may work seamlessly,\n\n281\n00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.250\na lot of them have to be managed,\nimported as we would often talk about.\n\n282\n00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.790\nSo, the cloud application architect\nis that entity, that role,\n\n283\n00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.960\nthat is going to employ that application\nto the cloud environment, manage,\n\n284\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.900\nmaintain it, care for it, and\nfeed it over its life cycle.\n\n285\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.930\nSo that's something we wanna\nmake sure we are aware of.\n\n286\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.930\nThey are responsible for\nassessment, verification,\n\n287\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.850\nand testing throughout all\nthe various phases of development and\n\n288\n00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.038\ndeployment of that application,\nwhat we would consider to be the SDLC.\n\n289\n00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:24.780\nThe software or system, depending on the\ndefinition in the focus, but in this case,\n\n290\n00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.310\nthe software develop the life cycle or\noffer a software design life cycle.\n\n291\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.360\nWe often talk about associated\nwith creating applications.\n\n292\n00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.060\nCloud architects, are going to be,\nwhoops, as I scroll pass my definition.\n\n293\n00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.280\nThe cloud architect is going to be the\nrole that determines essentially when and\n\n294\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.620\nhow a private Cloud is going to meet the\npolices required to set up and manage it.\n\n295\n00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.280\nSo this is going to be the visionary\nthat sits above the Cloud.\n\n296\n00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.190\nAnd, as a result of that,\nis gonna look down and\n\n297\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.060\nunderstand how to shape policy,\nshape direction, shape management and\n\n298\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.190\nthought process around\nthe use of the Cloud.\n\n299\n00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.830\nSo this is a role that designs\nCloud base systems and\n\n300\n00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:03.380\noversees the implementation\nof that design most likely.\n\n301\n00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.490\nSo we have to be aware of that.\n\n302\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.090\nWe designed private Clouds.\n\n303\n00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.700\nWe may do private Cloud\ndeployment as architects.\n\n304\n00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.960\nWe have a key role in laying out\nthe understanding in building the business\n\n305\n00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.020\nrequirements and the business case for\nthe business to deploy into the Cloud.\n\n306\n00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.480\nAnd really then shaping that vision.\n\n307\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.350\nImagining what that will be and\ndeploying accordingly.\n\n308\n00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.316\nWe also have a cloud data architect.\n\n309\n00:15:22.316 --> 00:15:24.231\nThe cloud data architect is gonna be yet\n\n310\n00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:28.123\nanother architectural role we carved out\nand defined, focused on the use of and\n\n311\n00:15:28.123 --> 00:15:31.568\nthe maintenance of and the management\nof data, with regards to this.\n\n312\n00:15:31.568 --> 00:15:35.372\nSo, the data architect's role there\nensuring various storage types and\n\n313\n00:15:35.372 --> 00:15:36.600\nvarious mechanisms for\n\n314\n00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.236\nstorage, are gonna be available to\nus within the cloud environment.\n\n315\n00:15:40.236 --> 00:15:44.507\nThat they conform to our SLA's, making\nsure that we are using, for instance,\n\n316\n00:15:44.507 --> 00:15:48.589\nhigh speed storage, because we have\nan SLA that guarantees a certain amount\n\n317\n00:15:48.589 --> 00:15:52.735\nof availability and up time, so we're\nnot using local attached storage with\n\n318\n00:15:52.735 --> 00:15:56.436\ntraditional magnetic drives But\nrather a hi-speed sound on fiber or\n\n319\n00:15:56.436 --> 00:16:00.249\nfiber channel in order to be able to\nthat with 40 GB on the back plane.\n\n320\n00:16:00.249 --> 00:16:02.509\nThat kind of thing would be\nthe storage architect's job.\n\n321\n00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:03.349\nAnd ultimately,\n\n322\n00:16:03.349 --> 00:16:07.740\nwe call the storage architects cloud data\narchitects in the language of the could.\n\n323\n00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.236\nAnd then, we have the cloud developer\noften goes hand in hand with\n\n324\n00:16:12.236 --> 00:16:14.708\nthe cloud application architect.\n\n325\n00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:18.649\nBecause if you think about it they often\nwill inhabit a very similar role and\n\n326\n00:16:18.649 --> 00:16:21.039\nstay traditionally in\na very similar space.\n\n327\n00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:23.735\nThe person that's going to\nfocus on the development for\n\n328\n00:16:23.735 --> 00:16:25.293\nthe cloud of this application.\n\n329\n00:16:25.293 --> 00:16:30.656\nAnd/or thinking through the logic\nof what we need to do in order\n\n330\n00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:35.929\nto be able to really not just\nfocus on the cloud applications.\n\n331\n00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:39.287\nWhich is really the purview of\nthe software application developer, but\n\n332\n00:16:39.287 --> 00:16:43.280\nmore broadly the applications in\nthe context of the infrastructure overall.\n\n333\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.350\nSo, how do we build the Cloud\nfrom the ground up and\n\n334\n00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.190\nensure that the environment we wind\nup with will be application friendly,\n\n335\n00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.310\nwill be data centric, and\nwill be policy managed?\n\n336\n00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:56.510\nThis is what the cloud developer\nhas to really focus on.\n\n337\n00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.516\nFocusing on the infrastructure itself, and\nhow to ultimately make sure the roles and\n\n338\n00:17:00.516 --> 00:17:04.199\ncomponents we lay out are going to be\nappropriate for the kind of cloud we need.\n\n339\n00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:05.519\nWe have a third tab I believe, right?\n\n340\n00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:06.219\n>> I do.\n\n341\n00:17:06.219 --> 00:17:09.440\n>> Some more definitions we're gonna\ngo to, there are only a few more.\n\n342\n00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.780\nWe have the cloud operator.\n\n343\n00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.807\nThe cloud operator is gonna be that\nperson that is responsible for\n\n344\n00:17:13.807 --> 00:17:16.349\nday to day administration and\noversight of the cloud.\n\n345\n00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:20.780\nWe often will think about\nmanagement versus administration.\n\n346\n00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.630\nManagement is more of an oversight\npolicy driven function\n\n347\n00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:28.490\nwhere as administration is typically\na day-to-day hands on set of activities.\n\n348\n00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:33.149\nThe cloud operator is going to be that\nhands on day-to-day person or tactician.\n\n349\n00:17:33.149 --> 00:17:36.761\nWhere as a cloud service manager is\ngonna be a little bit more step off,\n\n350\n00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:41.069\nthey're gonna laid back a little bit,\nthey're gonna be a broader focus in there.\n\n351\n00:17:41.069 --> 00:17:44.969\nThey're gonna be thinking about how to\nover see in coordinate activities for\n\n352\n00:17:44.969 --> 00:17:49.050\nvarious cloud operations and\nvarious administrative functions, right?\n\n353\n00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.400\nSo the Cloud service manager, they're\nresponsible for policy, for design, for\n\n354\n00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.140\nagreements on what service\nlines they're gonna offer.\n\n355\n00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.770\nWhat they're gonna cost they're the ones\nthat coordinate all the activities around\n\n356\n00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:02.970\nproviding the cloud and\noffering the opportunity to consume it.\n\n357\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.430\nSo they will make sure that we\nare thinking about working with cloud\n\n358\n00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.020\nmanagement and cloud customers to deliver\nthe value of the cloud, explain it and\n\n359\n00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.830\nmake it consumable.\n\n360\n00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.920\nThat's what cloud service managers are and\n\n361\n00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.500\ncloud storage administrators last but\ncertainly not least.\n\n362\n00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.120\nThey are going to help us to understand on\nhow to focus on the mapping, segregation,\n\n363\n00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.100\nbandwidth management and\nmonitoring of storage.\n\n364\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.560\nThey lay out our storage for us,\nand implement the design and\n\n365\n00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.290\nthe thought process of\nthe cloud storage architect.\n\n366\n00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.589\nRemember architect's\ntraditionally design and\n\n367\n00:18:33.589 --> 00:18:36.168\nadministrators traditionally manage and\nimplement.\n\n368\n00:18:36.168 --> 00:18:39.142\nIn some cases they will implement and\nmanage, in others they will take on\n\n369\n00:18:39.142 --> 00:18:42.790\nthe system that's already by implemented\nand they will manage it day to day.\n\n370\n00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.525\nSo the administrators gonna\nbe that hands on function,\n\n371\n00:18:45.525 --> 00:18:48.969\nwhereas the architect is really\nenvisioning what our design will be.\n\n372\n00:18:48.969 --> 00:18:51.429\nAnd we have to understand and\ndifferentiate between the two,\n\n373\n00:18:51.429 --> 00:18:53.569\nit's very important for\nus to understand the roles.\n\n374\n00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:57.277\nAnd to understand how those roles\nultimately are gonna be brought to bear\n\n375\n00:18:57.277 --> 00:18:59.118\nwith regards to the capabilities.\n\n376\n00:18:59.118 --> 00:19:02.553\nAnd ultimately with regards to\nan understanding of how the cloud is\n\n377\n00:19:02.553 --> 00:19:03.600\nshaped for us.\n\n378\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.650\nWe may not, as a business,\nhave all these roles.\n\n379\n00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.640\nWe may not as a business\nidentify all these roles.\n\n380\n00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:13.290\nSo this is something I find a lot\nof times with customers today,\n\n381\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:14.800\nas I talk to them about the cloud.\n\n382\n00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.299\nIt's something I hear from students a lot\nwhen we talk about this kind of content,\n\n383\n00:19:18.299 --> 00:19:19.529\nwhen I teach these classes.\n\n384\n00:19:19.529 --> 00:19:23.373\nI hear it in CISSP all the time,\nas well, when I teach that content or\n\n385\n00:19:23.373 --> 00:19:25.990\nI talk to customers about that material.\n\n386\n00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:29.250\nAnd they say, well,\nwe don't have a chief risk officer for\n\n387\n00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:30.860\ninstance, we don't carve out that role.\n\n388\n00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:34.250\nWe don't have a chief privacy officer,\nwe don't do BIA,\n\n389\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.620\nbusiness impact analysis, in\nthe traditional way you describe it, Adam.\n\n390\n00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:38.750\nWe call it something different.\n\n391\n00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:39.550\nIs that okay?\n\n392\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:40.220\nDoes that work?\n\n393\n00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:41.210\nIs that acceptable?\n\n394\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.620\nThe answer is absolutely,\n\n395\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.370\nyou don't have to have everyone of\nthese roles formally carved out.\n\n396\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.170\nYou don't have to have everyone\nof these roles formally defined.\n\n397\n00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.710\nBut what you need to have is an awareness\nof the fact that they exist and\n\n398\n00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:53.970\nthe value they offer.\n\n399\n00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.729\nAnd if you chose to consume them,\nif that adds value to you in other words,\n\n400\n00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:00.349\none size fits one,\nas opposed to one size fits all.\n\n401\n00:20:00.349 --> 00:20:02.113\nThen you should formally\ndefine those roles, and\n\n402\n00:20:02.113 --> 00:20:03.730\nyou should think about using them.\n\n403\n00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.240\nIf they don't, for any reason,\nif they confuse and\n\n404\n00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.560\nconfound rather than add value, then it's\nsomething you probably don't wanna use.\n\n405\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.870\nAnd in the real world,\nthat's perfectly acceptable.\n\n406\n00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.260\nBut understand with regards to\nexam preparation, it is vital for\n\n407\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.270\nyou to be able to define these roles.\n\n408\n00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.080\nUnderstand the formal definition,\nas we've laid them out for\n\n409\n00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.550\nyou here over the last few minutes.\n\n410\n00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.985\nHave a working sentence or two summary\nof each role, understand what it is,\n\n411\n00:20:25.985 --> 00:20:27.388\nunderstand the value it adds.\n\n412\n00:20:27.388 --> 00:20:30.177\nSo what the definition it is,\nthe value it adds,\n\n413\n00:20:30.177 --> 00:20:33.449\nwhat scenarios you may see\nthat role defined in, right.\n\n414\n00:20:33.449 --> 00:20:37.128\nSo it would be important to understand\nwhere you would see those roles,\n\n415\n00:20:37.128 --> 00:20:41.520\nwhat they would do, why we would deploy\nthem, why would there be a need for them.\n\n416\n00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.260\nYou can answer those questions, you're\ngonna be able to answer any questions\n\n417\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.020\nyou're asked about them, whether in the\nexam or by customers in the real world.\n\n418\n00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:52.940\nAs you as a CCSP offer your insight and\nyour guidance, with regards to security.\n\n419\n00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.830\nI get asked all the time from customers,\ndo I need to have\n\n420\n00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.655\nfour different architectural roles\nformally defined to run the cloud.\n\n421\n00:21:00.655 --> 00:21:02.245\nThe answer is absolutely not, but\n\n422\n00:21:02.245 --> 00:21:05.135\ndo you have to have some form\nof a thought process that says.\n\n423\n00:21:05.135 --> 00:21:06.715\nThere is this one person or\n\n424\n00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:09.535\nrole that is in charge of creating\nthe strategy for the cloud.\n\n425\n00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:12.965\nAnd we're calling that our chief\nstrategist or architect or\n\n426\n00:21:12.965 --> 00:21:13.965\nwhatever you call it?\n\n427\n00:21:13.965 --> 00:21:17.625\nShould you identify that role, populate\nthat with a knowledgeable individual or\n\n428\n00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:20.705\ngroup of individuals and\nshould you look to them for\n\n429\n00:21:20.705 --> 00:21:23.050\nthe road map necessary\nto implement the cloud?\n\n430\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.580\nAbsolutely, cuz without that,\n\n431\n00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:27.110\nyou're unfortunately not gonna\nbe able to really be successful.\n\n432\n00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.620\nSo how you get there, right,\nI know you wanted to say something.\n\n433\n00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.590\nI didn't mean to cut you off but\nhow you get there is important.\n\n434\n00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:37.480\nNot the specificity of the roles, not\nnecessarily, but the ideas they represent\n\n435\n00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:41.270\nbecomes very valuable, very important for\nus as signs on the road.\n\n436\n00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.050\nSign posts along the way to\ngive us that guidance, right?\n\n437\n00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.880\n>> Adam, would you say that a lot of\ntimes you'll see these roles being\n\n438\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:48.970\na person with many hats.\n\n439\n00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:51.830\nYou got a jack of all trades\ninside of an organization or\n\n440\n00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.830\nwould you say it's more segregated out.\n\n441\n00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.880\nThat there is a defined architect and\n\n442\n00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:58.610\nthere is a defined administrator or\nvice versa?\n\n443\n00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:59.730\n>> Yes.\n>> Yes.\n\n444\n00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.720\n>> [LAUGH] So I see, thank you very much.\n\n445\n00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.960\nI'm here all week.\n\n446\n00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.900\nSo we see to Daniel's point and\nit's a great point to make, right?\n\n447\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.568\nVery insightful because we see both and\nwhen I say yes,\n\n448\n00:22:10.568 --> 00:22:13.878\nI'm being a little bit facetious,\nobviously I'm joking around.\n\n449\n00:22:13.878 --> 00:22:16.227\nBut let's be serious for a minute,\nit's a very serious questions,\n\n450\n00:22:16.227 --> 00:22:17.960\nlet's give it an equally serious answer.\n\n451\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.156\nWe see both in the real world and\nit's a very good observation,\n\n452\n00:22:21.156 --> 00:22:23.993\nbecause in many organizations\nthat have had experience\n\n453\n00:22:23.993 --> 00:22:27.516\nwith cloud that have matured through\nthat early development model.\n\n454\n00:22:27.516 --> 00:22:28.817\nAnd I'm gonna have to come up for\nthe, no, it's all good.\n\n455\n00:22:28.817 --> 00:22:29.840\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> I'm going\n\n456\n00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.937\nto go this way\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n457\n00:22:30.937 --> 00:22:32.120\n>> And I'm going to stand over here and\n\n458\n00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.720\nyou'll only see half of me talking.\n\n459\n00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.605\nSo, what we see traditionally,\nis we say that as Cloud organizations, or\n\n460\n00:22:37.605 --> 00:22:41.306\nCloud deployments more mature,\nwe tend to see more differentiation of\n\n461\n00:22:41.306 --> 00:22:42.010\nrole,\n>> Mm-hm\n\n462\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.530\n>> And better definition\n\n463\n00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.030\nof what those roles are, because they\nrealize they have to sub divide those\n\n464\n00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:49.930\nroles to really understand how to\nmanage the Cloud more effectively.\n\n465\n00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.340\nWhere we might have just\na generic strategy role,\n\n466\n00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.750\nnow we're gonna see individual\narchitecture roles being defined\n\n467\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.520\nas we see more maturity\nentering the organization.\n\n468\n00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.430\nWhat we see early on in cloud\ndeployments a lot of the times\n\n469\n00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.020\nis kind of the opposite, we see a very,\nvery minimal role definition.\n\n470\n00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.955\nBecause we're traditionally\ndoing IT services, and\n\n471\n00:23:09.955 --> 00:23:12.015\nwe're just gonna give them to\nsomebody to manage, right.\n\n472\n00:23:12.015 --> 00:23:14.075\nSo we can use the same\nmodel to manage out.\n\n473\n00:23:14.075 --> 00:23:18.485\nWe just needed administrator and we need\nyour technician that's gonna go out and\n\n474\n00:23:18.485 --> 00:23:20.915\ndo the stuff everyday and\nwe need a manager, right.\n\n475\n00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:24.522\nSo we take those Traditional IT roles and\nwe carry them into the Cloud and\n\n476\n00:23:24.522 --> 00:23:27.492\nwe say that'll work, and\nit will to a degree.\n\n477\n00:23:27.492 --> 00:23:30.952\nBut what we find is that while the Cloud\nis a lot of things we know and\n\n478\n00:23:30.952 --> 00:23:32.462\na lot of things that are very similar.\n\n479\n00:23:32.462 --> 00:23:35.112\nAnd we're to talk a lot about\nthis in upcoming episodes, right?\n\n480\n00:23:35.112 --> 00:23:37.994\nThe concepts are very,\nvery similar to what we know.\n\n481\n00:23:37.994 --> 00:23:41.715\nWe have systems, they may be virtualized\nin many cases they are today and\n\n482\n00:23:41.715 --> 00:23:44.955\nthey're managed in a common\nplatform with shared resources.\n\n483\n00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:47.217\nNo problem,\nwe can do that we know about that,\n\n484\n00:23:47.217 --> 00:23:50.118\nIT has been doing that at one form or\nanother for a long time.\n\n485\n00:23:50.118 --> 00:23:53.699\nWe've been virtualizing without\nthe cloud for a very long time.\n\n486\n00:23:53.699 --> 00:23:57.290\nWe're now virtualizing with the cloud so\nit's just the next evolution of that.\n\n487\n00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.638\nBut we've tried to take the traditional\nIT thought process, right.\n\n488\n00:24:00.638 --> 00:24:05.480\nSystem admin, manager, stake holder.\n\n489\n00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.480\nAll those things we think of.\n\n490\n00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.140\nAnd we try to apply them to the cloud.\n\n491\n00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.670\nAnd what we find is while there is\nsynergy, there is alignment there,\n\n492\n00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.460\nit's not perfect.\n\n493\n00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.380\nIt's misaligned.\n\n494\n00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.370\nIt's like laying down foam floor tiles and\n\n495\n00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:17.990\ntrying to get the lines on\nthe fake wood to align.\n\n496\n00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.800\nIt's very very similar.\n\n497\n00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.330\nNot that you would know about that, but\n\n498\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.400\nI hear that's something you may have\nto worry about and do on occasion.\n\n499\n00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.630\nSo if you use that as an analogy,\na little inside joke here.\n\n500\n00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.260\nSo when you do that as an analogy,\nright, it's the same idea.\n\n501\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.110\nThe more aligned we wanna be, the more\nmature we become and we talk about\n\n502\n00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.790\nmaturity in the cloud space as being\nsomething that a organization strives for.\n\n503\n00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:39.140\nAnd so we have to think about that,\n\n504\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.120\nbecause as we use more cloud services,\nthese roles will become better defined.\n\n505\n00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.070\nBut it's a great observation,\nas I said already,\n\n506\n00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:46.990\nthat you made, because we see both.\n\n507\n00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:52.290\nAnd it really is a very good barometer for\nus as CCSPs to judge the maturity and\n\n508\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.790\ncloud awareness of an organization\nby how well defined the roles are.\n\n509\n00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.619\nIt's one of the ways, not the only way but\none of the ways we can\n\n510\n00:24:58.619 --> 00:25:02.160\nreally get a very quick read on how\nmature a cloud organization may be.\n\n511\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.660\nWhen I am asked to come in and\ndo audits in order to do security work for\n\n512\n00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.000\ncustomers, I start out\ndoing this exact thing.\n\n513\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.340\nI ask them to help me\nunderstand their org chart,\n\n514\n00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.070\nessentially lay out what the ground model\nlooks like for you to manage cloud.\n\n515\n00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:18.630\nAnd as we define that, I can tell very\nquickly how mature an organization is and\n\n516\n00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.490\nwhere they are on their continuum\nof really understanding the cloud,\n\n517\n00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.710\nunderstanding risk.\n\n518\n00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.820\nAnd defining the organization\nthrough the cloud, or\n\n519\n00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:30.620\ndoes the lack of the definition\nimplement or in my\n\n520\n00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.500\nmind have me think through the idea that\nultimately that organization is consuming.\n\n521\n00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.717\nBut they don't really understand\nwhat they are consuming and\n\n522\n00:25:37.717 --> 00:25:39.170\nthey are managing it appropriately.\n\n523\n00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.882\nThat's something to consider.\n\n524\n00:25:40.882 --> 00:25:42.650\nWe've talked about\nthe key Cloud components,\n\n525\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.070\ncharacteristics just a reminder of them.\n\n526\n00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.420\nI don't know if we actually\nlisted them anywhere.\n\n527\n00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.440\nWe probably did not.\n\n528\n00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.965\nWe have them in this documentation.\n\n529\n00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:51.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We didn't actually put them out\n\n530\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.770\nand list them.\n\n531\n00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.290\nWe'll probably throw that\ninto a Word document,\n\n532\n00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.296\njust have them as bullet points for\nyou at some point.\n\n533\n00:25:56.296 --> 00:26:01.290\nBut remember, on-demand self-service,\nbroad network access, resource pooling,\n\n534\n00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:05.965\nrapid elasticity, scale up, scale out,\nscale down and measured services, KPIs and\n\n535\n00:26:05.965 --> 00:26:09.165\nthe ability to essentially pay as\nyou go becomes very important.\n\n536\n00:26:09.165 --> 00:26:11.085\nThese are the key cloud\ncomputing characteristics.\n\n537\n00:26:11.085 --> 00:26:12.725\nWanna make sure we're aware of them.\n\n538\n00:26:12.725 --> 00:26:16.825\nThey come directly to us from this\ndate 10145 and this date 10146.\n\n539\n00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:20.665\nThat's the referencable information\nyou want to make sure you have.\n\n540\n00:26:20.665 --> 00:26:24.029\nAll of these things are important,\nbecause if we don't have all five of these\n\n541\n00:26:24.029 --> 00:26:27.033\ncharacteristics, according to our\ndefinitions in our agreement,\n\n542\n00:26:27.033 --> 00:26:28.741\nwe don't really have a cloud service,\n\n543\n00:26:28.741 --> 00:26:32.209\nwe may have things approaching the cloud\nservice but we don't really have a true\n\n544\n00:26:32.209 --> 00:26:35.820\ncloud service in the modern definitional\nsense of what cloud computing is today.\n\n545\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.680\nAnd as a result of that we're\ngonna struggle a little bit to\n\n546\n00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.970\nunderstand how to actually define\nwhat it is we're consuming.\n\n547\n00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.735\nA lot of my customers early on,\nover the last five, seven, eight years,\n\n548\n00:26:45.735 --> 00:26:48.600\nwere moving to virtualized platforms,\nso they were virtualizing a lot,\n\n549\n00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:53.890\nwhether it was VM ware, not really hyper V\nuntil recently, but hyper V more and more.\n\n550\n00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.830\nCitrix, whatever it would have been.\n\n551\n00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:58.550\nAnd they would say, hey,\nwe're virtualizing, so we're doing cloud.\n\n552\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:26:59.550\nAnd I would say, hey, no you're not.\n\n553\n00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:01.110\nAnd they would say, yes we are,\n\n554\n00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:03.540\nand we would have a philosophical\ndiscussion about that.\n\n555\n00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.506\nAnd what we would find is that they\nthought they were doing cloud because\n\n556\n00:27:06.506 --> 00:27:09.380\ncloud had been couched in\nterms of virtualization.\n\n557\n00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.380\nIf you virtualize you must be doing cloud.\n\n558\n00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.280\nNo, if you virtualize,\nyou must be virtualizing.\n\n559\n00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:13.800\nRight.\n\n560\n00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.140\nIf you virtualize, that has no bearing\non you doing cloud necessarily.\n\n561\n00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.320\nIt may be an indicator of the fact\nthat you are doing cloud.\n\n562\n00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:21.870\nBut it also may be an indicator\nof the fact that you're not.\n\n563\n00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.580\nJust because you virtualize your data\ncenter does not mean you're doing\n\n564\n00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.670\ncloud computing.\n\n565\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:29.010\nIt just means that you built the basis for\nthe ability to do cloud computing.\n\n566\n00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.860\nAnd so we can virtualize with or\nwithout cloud, but\n\n567\n00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:36.060\nwe cannot cloud or\nengage in cloud without virtualization.\n\n568\n00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.890\nAnd we want to understand this dichotomy.\n\n569\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.235\nYou must have virtualization underlying\nthe cloud platform really to make use of\n\n570\n00:27:42.235 --> 00:27:46.875\ncloud as it is defined because this\nrapid elasticity, rapid scalability,\n\n571\n00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:51.175\nthe ability of measured services,\nthe ubiquitous broad network access.\n\n572\n00:27:51.175 --> 00:27:55.565\nAll of this speaks to the idea that\nvirtualization technologies and\n\n573\n00:27:55.565 --> 00:27:59.935\nnewer iterations of that containerization\nand frameworks like devops and\n\n574\n00:27:59.935 --> 00:28:03.520\nall the things we build around the cloud\nthat are becoming lateral to it and\n\n575\n00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.630\nsupporting elements of it.\n\n576\n00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.520\nAnd indeed, are becoming part of\nthe discussion of cloud more and\n\n577\n00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.350\nmore every day,\nare really the underlying enablers.\n\n578\n00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.920\nYou would be hard-pressed to\nfigure out how to do cloud\n\n579\n00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.130\nwithout doing virtualization.\n\n580\n00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.890\nIt would be almost impossible for you to\nreally define a solution that works and\n\n581\n00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.860\nis scalable in the enterprise today.\n\n582\n00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:24.440\nYeah, we can virtualize the entire\nstack and not cloud enable it.\n\n583\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.590\nNot make it available through the cloud,\nso\n\n584\n00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.950\nit's consumable outside the organization.\n\n585\n00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:34.050\nNot decide to share it with broad network\naccess, make it instantly scalable,\n\n586\n00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.810\nmeasure it and consume on demand.\n\n587\n00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.375\nWe could simply virtualize for\nthe sake of virtualization.\n\n588\n00:28:38.375 --> 00:28:42.785\nSo, we do wanna understand as we think\nthrough this, that all the things we've\n\n589\n00:28:42.785 --> 00:28:46.315\nbeen discussing are indicators of\nroles that would be available.\n\n590\n00:28:46.315 --> 00:28:48.725\nWe've just simply really put the word\ncloud in front of every role.\n\n591\n00:28:48.725 --> 00:28:49.950\nIf you think about it, right?\n\n592\n00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.290\nWe have storage administrators whether or\nnot we have cloud.\n\n593\n00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.450\nIn many organizations,\nwe have storage architects.\n\n594\n00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:58.860\nIf we're doing large scale virtualization,\nwe're gonna have storage networks and\n\n595\n00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:02.280\nwe're gonna need an architect to manage\nthis app, but it may not be cloud enabled.\n\n596\n00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.270\nSo slapping the word cloud in\nfront of something helps us to\n\n597\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:08.320\nnarrowly define tailor and\nscope, what that is.\n\n598\n00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.030\nIt narrows in other words\nthe definitional framework, but\n\n599\n00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.990\nit also broadens our ability to\nconsume and so this is one of,\n\n600\n00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.050\nyou know, the great enablers that\nwe talk about with the cloud.\n\n601\n00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:23.700\nIt makes everything broadly accessible and\nit changes the nature of IT services for\n\n602\n00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.350\nus today and as an extension, we'll talk\nabout this more in upcoming episodes,\n\n603\n00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.760\nchanges the nature of risk and how we\nunderstand and manage risk, as well.\n\n604\n00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.160\nSo, it's also very important for\nus to think about and consider.\n\n605\n00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.090\n>> So adding the word cloud\nreally just gives us a context\n\n606\n00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.920\nin which we can better understand\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n607\n00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.010\nSo if I say cloud storage versus\njust storage, like you said,\n\n608\n00:29:44.010 --> 00:29:45.220\nit narrows the definition of it.\n\n609\n00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.127\nIt gives me more of a context in which to\nunderstand where you're coming from and\n\n610\n00:29:49.127 --> 00:29:50.597\nwhat we're speaking about.\n\n611\n00:29:50.597 --> 00:29:51.817\n>> It does, it's also fun to say.\n\n612\n00:29:51.817 --> 00:29:53.557\n>> It is.\n>> Say it with me, cloud storage.\n\n613\n00:29:53.557 --> 00:29:54.248\n>> Cloud storage.\n>> It's so\n\n614\n00:29:54.248 --> 00:29:55.438\nmuch more fun than just storage.\n\n615\n00:29:55.438 --> 00:29:56.855\n>> And we could use the word elasticity,\nright?\n\n616\n00:29:56.855 --> 00:29:59.290\n>> I know, that's always fun to say and\nplay with.\n\n617\n00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:00.930\nYou remember when you were growing up?\n\n618\n00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.780\nI'm a few years older than\nyou I have a feeling,\n\n619\n00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:05.265\neven though I have more hair than you.\n\n620\n00:30:05.265 --> 00:30:07.211\nAlmost, not quite, but mine's all grey.\n\n621\n00:30:07.211 --> 00:30:10.237\nBut depending on how old you are when you\nwere growing up, you remember silly putty?\n\n622\n00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:11.402\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n>> You probably played with it when\n\n623\n00:30:11.402 --> 00:30:11.925\nyou were a kid, right?\n\n624\n00:30:11.925 --> 00:30:14.358\n>> Who didn't?\n[CROSSTALK] I think Peter actually some\n\n625\n00:30:14.358 --> 00:30:15.733\nout on his desk right now.\n\n626\n00:30:15.733 --> 00:30:16.765\n>> That would be awesome.\n\n627\n00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:18.390\nWe should bring some in and\nput it on the floor.\n\n628\n00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.420\nIt would look just like the wood.\n\n629\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.750\nYou would never know the difference.\n\n630\n00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.859\nBut when you think about silly putty,\nif you played with it as a kid,\n\n631\n00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:27.393\nit was essentially this plasticine goo.\n\n632\n00:30:27.393 --> 00:30:29.864\nBut you would play with it and\nthe thing I loved about it,\n\n633\n00:30:29.864 --> 00:30:33.086\nyou could put it down on a piece of\npaper or whatever it would have been so.\n\n634\n00:30:33.086 --> 00:30:35.123\nYeah, you can take something like this and\nI use to use for\n\n635\n00:30:35.123 --> 00:30:36.720\nthe comics like the funny pages, right?\n\n636\n00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.810\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, you would do that on Sunday.\n\n637\n00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.660\nYou would get that, you would put\nit on there, you'd pull it up and\n\n638\n00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.740\nyou'd have your Prince Valiant or\nwhatever it was.\n\n639\n00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.612\nYou'd reproduce it, right?\n\n640\n00:30:42.612 --> 00:30:44.057\nAnd it would be,\nI'm sorry I got you out of order there.\n\n641\n00:30:44.057 --> 00:30:44.614\n>> It's all right, you're fine.\n\n642\n00:30:44.614 --> 00:30:48.460\n>> It would be really cool and when\nyou think about that, it's fun, right?\n\n643\n00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.800\nIt's just fun for fun's sake.\n\n644\n00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.540\nYou describe silly putty to people and\nthey're like, well, why do you do that?\n\n645\n00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.110\nWhy not?\n\n646\n00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.810\nIt's fun.\n\n647\n00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.560\nAnd so, why not the cloud is\nwhat I often tell customers.\n\n648\n00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.160\nAnd I'm being tongue and cheek, right?\n\n649\n00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.630\nThere are many reasons why the cloud\nmay or may not make sense, so\n\n650\n00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.190\nwe're gonna get into all of\nthis in upcoming episodes.\n\n651\n00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.380\nBut on the surface when you look at\nthe value propositions of the cloud,\n\n652\n00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.280\nit's hard not to be taken in and\nexcited about the proposition\n\n653\n00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.650\nof scalable consumption,\npay as you go, on-demand access.\n\n654\n00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:19.050\nI mean,\nthat's like the perfect world, right?\n\n655\n00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:22.910\nIf the rest of the world worked that way,\neverything would actually be good.\n\n656\n00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.020\nThe problem is of course,\nthe devil's in the detail.\n\n657\n00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.708\nRight?\nAnd so we'll see that the risks associated\n\n658\n00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:30.799\nwith that,\nthe lack of clarity about role definition,\n\n659\n00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:33.696\nthe inability to understand\nwho's responsible for\n\n660\n00:31:33.696 --> 00:31:37.343\ncertain aspects and when the customer\nis not and the provider is.\n\n661\n00:31:37.343 --> 00:31:41.603\nThat very specific demarkation,\nthat ability to be willing to let go,\n\n662\n00:31:41.603 --> 00:31:45.366\nto tell the provider,\nI'm going to give you access to my data,\n\n663\n00:31:45.366 --> 00:31:47.289\nI'm going to let you back it up.\n\n664\n00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:48.588\nI'm going to back up.\n\n665\n00:31:48.588 --> 00:31:51.814\nHands off right, and I'm going to\nstand back here, and I'm gonna trust.\n\n666\n00:31:51.814 --> 00:31:53.074\nAnd this is the big word.\n\n667\n00:31:53.074 --> 00:31:54.994\nWe often don't speak about with the Cloud.\n\n668\n00:31:54.994 --> 00:31:55.914\nIt's unspoken.\n\n669\n00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:57.818\nI'm gonna trust you, Mr. and Mrs.\n\n670\n00:31:57.818 --> 00:32:01.170\nProvider, to do the right thing and\nsafe guard our data.\n\n671\n00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.260\nAnd all this without exception.\n\n672\n00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:04.920\nLet's be fair and let's be equitable.\n\n673\n00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.028\nLet's pay our respects\nwhere respects our due.\n\n674\n00:32:07.028 --> 00:32:13.320\nCloud providers do an awesome job,\n99.999% of the time, on average,\n\n675\n00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.930\nin the commercial space, providing those\nservices day in and day out relentlessly.\n\n676\n00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:22.050\nAnd through millions and millions of\ncycles, do so with no trouble at all.\n\n677\n00:32:22.050 --> 00:32:23.520\n>> And that's like the literal statistic,\nright?\n\n678\n00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.650\n[LAUGH]\n>> That is.\n\n679\n00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:25.690\nYeah, no literally.\n\n680\n00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:26.930\nAnd so, we wanna be fair.\n\n681\n00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.020\n>> Yeah.\n>> We wanna be even handed.\n\n682\n00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.770\nThe Cloud providers that are in business,\nthat are doing well,\n\n683\n00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:34.890\nthat are reputable, cuz there's always\nthat kind of dark corner, right?\n\n684\n00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.770\nThat you could go to where things\nlook a little too good to be true,\n\n685\n00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.710\ncost a little bit less than everybody\nelse, and there's a reason for that.\n\n686\n00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:41.420\nRight?\n\n687\n00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.330\nAnd so, when you stick to the mainstream,\n\n688\n00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.410\nwhen you consume with companies\nthat have a reputation,\n\n689\n00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:50.085\nthat are going to stand by what they do\nand that are doing the right thing, you're\n\n690\n00:32:50.085 --> 00:32:53.610\ngonna be able to experience that level\nof service, and you're gonna be happy.\n\n691\n00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.530\nAs a Cloud customer,\nyou're gonna be happy.\n\n692\n00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:57.050\nAre you gonna be happy all the time?\n\n693\n00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.110\nNobody is happy all the time unless\nyou're taking substances that\n\n694\n00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.260\nallow you to be happy all the time, right?\n\n695\n00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.100\nAnd so, the reality is, unless you\nmodify reality, it's very unlikely that,\n\n696\n00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.360\nas a customer,\nyou're never gonna have a bad experience.\n\n697\n00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.690\nIt's always gonna be something.\n\n698\n00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:13.690\nI've been on, for my business,\nour company, right, outside of my little\n\n699\n00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.400\ntime I spend with you here every so often\nwhen I pop up on the screen here at IT TV.\n\n700\n00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.130\nMy day job, as it were,\n\n701\n00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:25.090\nin the company that I help run IT for,\nthat I spend my time with, and I have for\n\n702\n00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.230\nthe last 19 years, as many of you know,\nwith New Horizons.\n\n703\n00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.850\nWhen I'm there in our franchises in\nSouth Florida and the Caribbean managing\n\n704\n00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:36.650\ninfrastructure for our corner of the\nworld, we outsourced close to a decade ago\n\n705\n00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.420\nto Microsoft on the Cloud with what was\nthen BPOS before it became Office 365.\n\n706\n00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.560\nAnd the business productivity\nsolution that predated Office 365,\n\n707\n00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.110\nthe first iteration of\nthe Microsoft Cloud.\n\n708\n00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.960\nI saw the writing on\nthe wall a decade ago.\n\n709\n00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.150\nAnd I said I don't wanna get\nthe call at 2 in the morning and\n\n710\n00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.700\nmanage infrastructure when\nthe exchange server goes out.\n\n711\n00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.600\nI had built those platforms,\nthis exchange 4.0.\n\n712\n00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.290\nAnd even Microsoft mail before that, and\neven platforms earlier than that, right?\n\n713\n00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:06.810\nI mean, I go back to MT35, and\nI go back to DOS and before.\n\n714\n00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:10.160\nWe used to write on clay tablets\nback in the Sumerian days, right?\n\n715\n00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.870\nAnd so, I've been doing this a long time.\n\n716\n00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:15.002\nAnd I've built platforms and\ninfrastructure across the depth and\n\n717\n00:34:15.002 --> 00:34:16.850\nbreadth of architecture that\nany of us listening, for\n\n718\n00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.520\nthe most part,\nprobably have probably seen.\n\n719\n00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.770\n>> I think they just unearthed one\nof your previous data centers.\n\n720\n00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:22.320\nThey did.\n\n721\n00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:23.777\nThey did.\nIt was in-\n\n722\n00:34:23.777 --> 00:34:25.620\n>> Some Egyptian area.\n\n723\n00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.050\n>> No, no, the quarry that Fred Flintstone\nused to work at whatever the hell that\n\n724\n00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:28.640\nwas Bedrock.\n\n725\n00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.570\n>> Bedrock.\n>> It was at Bedrock.\n\n726\n00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.170\nThere you go.\n\n727\n00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:31.470\nSo, yes, they found it, right?\n\n728\n00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.675\nAnd Barney was still there\nstanding guard at the door.\n\n729\n00:34:33.675 --> 00:34:35.070\nBut when you think about it, I mean,\n\n730\n00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.010\nI was telling you about\none of the other episodes,\n\n731\n00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.275\none of the other shows we've done, I think\nit was for CISSP, may have been for CASP.\n\n732\n00:34:40.275 --> 00:34:43.630\nWe were talking about and\nstreet talk, for instance.\n\n733\n00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.150\nI don't know if you have\na point of reference for that,\n\n734\n00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.310\nthat may have been a little\nbit before your time.\n\n735\n00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:51.005\nBut that was one of the very\nearly collaborations systems,\n\n736\n00:34:51.005 --> 00:34:54.505\nnetworking solutions,\nright around with Novel.\n\n737\n00:34:54.505 --> 00:34:56.862\nAnd Novel, early on when Novel and\nNetware first came out on the bindery and\n\n738\n00:34:56.862 --> 00:34:57.835\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n739\n00:34:57.835 --> 00:34:58.915\nI go back to these systems.\n\n740\n00:34:58.915 --> 00:35:01.005\nThis is what I learned on and\nwhat I built.\n\n741\n00:35:01.005 --> 00:35:02.865\nAnd into the modern day.\n\n742\n00:35:02.865 --> 00:35:07.095\nAnd so, the reality of that model\nnow is that it's very scalable.\n\n743\n00:35:07.095 --> 00:35:08.255\nAnd we can do all sorts of stuff.\n\n744\n00:35:08.255 --> 00:35:09.755\nAnd these providers are doing great stuff.\n\n745\n00:35:09.755 --> 00:35:14.220\nBut I got to a point where I said I\ncan pay somebody to manage my risk and\n\n746\n00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.570\nkeep my boss happy.\n\n747\n00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:16.550\nEmail's on, right?\n\n748\n00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:20.190\nSales people can get their email,\nmy customers can talk to my sales people.\n\n749\n00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.320\nThat's the defining metric in my world.\n\n750\n00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.100\nThat we can talk to our customers.\n\n751\n00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.997\nIf email's available,\nI don't have to worry about stuff.\n\n752\n00:35:26.997 --> 00:35:30.655\nAnd if I can pay somebody X number dollars\na month to do that, and they can do\n\n753\n00:35:30.655 --> 00:35:34.550\nit consistently, why would I wanna take\non the liability in managing myself?\n\n754\n00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.430\nSo, I got smart about a decade ago.\n\n755\n00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:39.520\nWe out sourced, and\nwe've been on the Cloud ever since.\n\n756\n00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.760\nAnd while I still maintain infrastructure,\nand I certainly build and manage systems\n\n757\n00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.850\nfor customers all over the place, I don't\nhave to do it for myself anymore because\n\n758\n00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.940\nI'm so busy doing it for customers, I\ndon't have time to do it for our company.\n\n759\n00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.080\n>> It's nice to be the one picking up the\nphone instead of answering it, isn't it?\n\n760\n00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:55.461\n>> It's nice to not pick\nup the phone period.\n\n761\n00:35:55.461 --> 00:35:56.941\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what you learn when you get\n\n762\n00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:57.870\nto a certain point in life.\n\n763\n00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.020\nI got to that point where I made it so\n\n764\n00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:04.629\neasy to [CROSSTALK] right to the point\nthat I didn't have to worry about it.\n\n765\n00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:08.750\nSo, when we have a problem,\nI see the email, I get the phone call.\n\n766\n00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.690\nBut my response is, hey, guess what,\nMicrosoft's already on it.\n\n767\n00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.390\nLet me go look at the admin console.\n\n768\n00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.980\nAnd I promise you there's already\na ticket open that says, by the way,\n\n769\n00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.040\nthis is what we're doing.\n\n770\n00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.160\nAnd this is the progression of\nservice we're restoring for you.\n\n771\n00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.820\nAnd in two hours it'll be back on.\n\n772\n00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:23.170\nAnd I don't even have to open a ticket.\n\n773\n00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:25.600\nBecause it's not just me that's affected,\nit's me and\n\n774\n00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.340\na thousand other customers, right, on that\nparticular instance on that platform.\n\n775\n00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.840\nSo, it's an economy of scale.\n\n776\n00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.460\nAnd so, when you are doing this,\nright, whether it's IaaS, PasS or\n\n777\n00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:35.365\nSasS, if you get to that point and\n\n778\n00:36:35.365 --> 00:36:39.180\nyou're hosting the right way,\nyou can really step back and focus in.\n\n779\n00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.820\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthis reallocation of resources\n\n780\n00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.710\nthroughout a lot of the episodes\nthat are coming up.\n\n781\n00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.390\nAnd what we can do at that time\nas Cloud professionals, and\n\n782\n00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:50.440\nhow we can get better at focusing\non security and addressing risk.\n\n783\n00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.690\nBecause we have more time to identify\nthe things that are important, cuz we're\n\n784\n00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:57.810\nspending less time chasing around the\ninfrastructure and more time focusing on\n\n785\n00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.100\nanalyzing and understanding information\nmanagement, which can be very important.\n\n786\n00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.860\n>> Adam,\nyou are definitely a wealth of knowledge.\n\n787\n00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.590\nWe're so thankful that you're here\nhelping us understand these things.\n\n788\n00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.590\nAnd now we've-\n>> I make it up as I go.\n\n789\n00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.230\n>> Yeah, he's just-\n>> I just make it up.\n\n790\n00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.940\nI don't even know.\n\n791\n00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.010\nHalf the time I'm not sure.\n\n792\n00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:11.750\n>> Just winging it.\n\n793\n00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:12.390\n>> Just winging it.\n\n794\n00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:17.530\n>> [LAUGH] But no, in all seriousness,\nyou obviously have a great command of\n\n795\n00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:21.100\nthis bed of knowledge that we need\nto be able to pass our exams and\n\n796\n00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:25.380\nto become efficient admins and\narchitects in a Cloud environment.\n\n797\n00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.860\nSo, that's what we are doing today, and we\nthank you for explaining these different\n\n798\n00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.930\nthings for us so we know exactly what our\nroles may be inside of our organizations\n\n799\n00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:37.410\nand what they may become one day as\nwe mature in our Cloud environments.\n\n800\n00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.220\nAll right.\nSo, that looks like we're out of time for\n\n801\n00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.260\nthis episode.\n\n802\n00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.420\nBut, again, but wait, there's more-\n>> There's always more.\n\n803\n00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.600\n>> There's definitely\ngonna be more coming up.\n\n804\n00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.750\nSo, we'll have another episode for\nyou guys very, very shortly.\n\n805\n00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:49.450\nAgain, Adam, thanks for stopping by.\n\n806\n00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:51.710\nWe thank you guys for watching, and\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n807\n00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.450\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowry.\n\n808\n00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.420\n>> So, I\"m gonna ask you guys\na question before I say goodbye.\n\n809\n00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.080\nI feel incredibly short standing next\nto this tall gentleman over here.\n\n810\n00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.520\nYou can see there's a very very\ngreat height differential.\n\n811\n00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:05.350\nIf you guys can guess how much,\nyeah, he goes and I go like this.\n\n812\n00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.430\nIf you could guess how\nmuch taller he is than me,\n\n813\n00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:08.490\nwe'll come up with something for you.\n\n814\n00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:09.950\nI'm not sure what, but\nwe'll come up with something.\n\n815\n00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:13.705\nSo, send your guesses in here, and\nwe'll see if we can figure it out.\n\n816\n00:38:13.705 --> 00:38:15.920\nCuz I'm dying to find out how\nmuch shorter I am than him.\n\n817\n00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.080\nI feel like a hobbit standing here\nnext to a very, very tall person.\n\n818\n00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.220\nSo, I'm short, and we'll see you later.\n\n819\n00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.190\n>> See you next time.\n\n820\n00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.020\n>> Come on back and\njoin us for the next episode.\n\n821\n00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.771\n>> See you next time, guys.\n\n822\n00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:34.730\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

everyone, welcome\nto another exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:21.143\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n5\n00:00:21.143 --> 00:00:23.272\ncertified cloud security\nprofessional series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:25.371\nJoining us back in the studio today for\n\n7\n00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:29.052\nour little mini series into part\nfour already is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:30.795\nAdam, welcome back to the show sir and\nhow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:31.680\n>> Good, good.\n\n10\n00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.390\nI like how you worked mini into that\ndiscussion considering the shortness theme\n\n11\n00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.590\nwe're carrying through here.\n\n12\n00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.010\nSo I'm doing well, I'm doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.700\nHopefully everybody out there is as well.\n\n14\n00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.220\nWe are going to continue our exciting\nconversation about the cloud.\n\n15\n00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.513\nBut we are not gonna short\nshrift it in any way.\n\n16\n00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:47.093\n>> Keep up with that thing.\n\n17\n00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:49.167\n>> Keep it going.\nWe're going to stretch it out and\n\n18\n00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:50.715\nmake it as big-\n>> Whole episode full of puns.\n\n19\n00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:54.430\n>> And as exciting and\npun filled as possible.\n\n20\n00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.971\nRemember we have talked about\ncloud surface categories and\n\n21\n00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:00.476\nwe're just going to hit the highlights\nhere really quickly on them just reinforce\n\n22\n00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:01.559\nthis IaaS PaaS and SaaS.\n\n23\n00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.215\nComing out of the newest 800,\n145, 146 documentation.\n\n24\n00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.150\nI'm stressing that for\nyou in the first couple of episodes.\n\n25\n00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.630\nActually the first three or\nfour we've been through.\n\n26\n00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.720\nCuz I want you to not only know what these\nservice deployment models are, I want you\n\n27\n00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.330\nto know where to find them, if you want\nto look them up and interact with them.\n\n28\n00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.900\nBut you do need to know\nthe cloud service categories.\n\n29\n00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.535\nWe've talked about\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n30\n00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:21.750\nLet's start at the bottom of the stack,\nwork our way up.\n\n31\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.880\nThis is remember where we provision\nthe infrastructure as a service.\n\n32\n00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.380\nWe go to the service provider and\nsay, hey, I want five hosts,\n\n33\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.750\nI want this much memory,\nthis much storage.\n\n34\n00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.690\nI want this much CPU.\n\n35\n00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.830\nI want this much network bandwidth.\n\n36\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.920\nHave all those components provisioned out.\n\n37\n00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.070\nReally the key components and\ncharacteristics here are scalability,\n\n38\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430\nconverged networks and\nIT capacity in terms of pooling, so\n\n39\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.440\nwe can rely on that bandwidth, rely on\nthat storage infrastructure, excuse me.\n\n40\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.470\nAnd rely on those performance\nenhancement capabilities of CPUs and\n\n41\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.870\nRAM being allocated up.\n\n42\n00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.713\nSelf service and or on demand capacity and\nhigh reliability and\n\n43\n00:01:56.713 --> 00:01:59.490\nresilience are typically\nwhat we talk about here.\n\n44\n00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.330\nKey benefits traditionally, usage is\nmetered and priced on the basis of some\n\n45\n00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.830\nsort of consumption so I use so\nmany processor cycles.\n\n46\n00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.660\nI use so many units of storage, whatever\nit may be and I'm paying for that as I go.\n\n47\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.026\nSo I really am in charge of my world\nin a sense that I can decide what I\n\n48\n00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.906\nwanna provision and\nwhat I ultimately want to not own but\n\n49\n00:02:17.906 --> 00:02:21.851\nessentially rent because remember\nwe're not owning the infrastructure.\n\n50\n00:02:21.851 --> 00:02:24.636\nWe are, and this is a really\nimportant point for Cloud services.\n\n51\n00:02:24.636 --> 00:02:28.174\nWe are taking what would\ntraditionally be a cap ex,\n\n52\n00:02:28.174 --> 00:02:31.386\na capital expenditure\nexpense where we buy and\n\n53\n00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:36.425\ninvest in infrastructure over a three or\nfive year depreciation cycle.\n\n54\n00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:38.548\nAnd we're shifting that to an op ex,\n\n55\n00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:41.902\nan operational expense on\nthe financial spreadsheet, or\n\n56\n00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:46.292\non essentially the balance score card\nof the finances of the organization.\n\n57\n00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:50.483\nAnd so we see a shift from cap ex to op ex\nwhere we now have a recurring monthly fee\n\n58\n00:02:50.483 --> 00:02:54.289\nmore or less within a certain parameter or\ncertain spread if you will,\n\n59\n00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:59.001\nwhich we know we're always spending $100\na month on average if that's what we have\n\n60\n00:02:59.001 --> 00:03:02.390\nbargained for and what we've budgeted for.\n\n61\n00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.250\nAnd IaaS helps us to figure that out.\n\n62\n00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.410\nAll three models do, by the way, but\nthey do from different perspectives.\n\n63\n00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.520\nSo metered usage,\nmetered consumption, scale up and\n\n64\n00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.215\nscale down on demand, reduce costs of\nownership, this cap ex, op ex switch and\n\n65\n00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:17.935\nreduced energy and cooling costs,\nthis is also pretty important.\n\n66\n00:03:17.935 --> 00:03:21.865\nWe're handing off the infrastructure\nburden, reliability and\n\n67\n00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:25.895\nthe ownership of that to a provider that's\nessentially gonna manage that on our\n\n68\n00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:30.000\nbehalf and factor in all those\ncosts to our monthly recurring fee.\n\n69\n00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.970\nYou know we as customers\ndon't often think about that.\n\n70\n00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:32.940\nSo for instance,\n\n71\n00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.000\nI'm sure you probably as I do right\nmost of us do have a cell phone?\n\n72\n00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.610\nHave cable?\n\n73\n00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.784\n>> I do.\n>> Any of those, all those, right.\n\n74\n00:03:37.784 --> 00:03:41.572\nSo those are monthly fees right, if you\nthink about a service plan traditionally.\n\n75\n00:03:41.572 --> 00:03:46.140\nYou use your cell phone with Verizon,\nAT&T, Sprint.\n\n76\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.170\nWho you going with, T Mobile?\n\n77\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.160\n>> I think we're with AT&T here.\n\n78\n00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.170\n>> Okay, so AT&T right, and Verizon.\n\n79\n00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.580\nAnd you know my story about my Blackberry.\n\n80\n00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.030\nMe and John Chen the CEO.\n\n81\n00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.080\nTwo people in the world\nleft using Blackberries.\n\n82\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.380\nBut, I'm on Verizon.\n\n83\n00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.360\nI have been for many, many years and\ngood, bad and different.\n\n84\n00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.960\nI got a bill every month,\nI know what it costs me.\n\n85\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.280\nI'm gonna bill you know x number\nof dollars to my business,\n\n86\n00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.380\nthe rest essentially is mine\nbecause I have a family plan.\n\n87\n00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.280\nAnd as a result I know every\nmonth what my expense is.\n\n88\n00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.470\nAs long as I don't over consume my data\nprovision of x number of gigabytes,\n\n89\n00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.420\nI'm good right?\n\n90\n00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.240\nSo it's real simple, and this is\nessentially what the cloud model is and\n\n91\n00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.110\nit touches every aspect of what we do.\n\n92\n00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.430\nCell phones today It's cable today.\n\n93\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.040\nIt's anything you can think of, right?\n\n94\n00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.650\nI mean you know, you drive so far, you\npay so much in gas, gas costs x number of\n\n95\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.650\ndollars a gallon, you're essentially\nconsuming, you know what it takes.\n\n96\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.545\nSo, this benefit is essentially gonna\nbe the idea of managing our expense.\n\n97\n00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.425\nAnd managing our expense from\nan IaaS perspective is really,\n\n98\n00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:44.275\nreally important for us to think about.\n\n99\n00:04:44.275 --> 00:04:45.575\nWhat about platform as a service?\n\n100\n00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:46.315\nWhat about PaaS?\n\n101\n00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:49.375\nMoving up, we're now getting the IaaS,\nthe infrastructure,\n\n102\n00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.215\nalong with the operating environment,\nthe operating system.\n\n103\n00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:55.955\nSo the ability to have the cloud\nservice provider provision out for\n\n104\n00:04:55.955 --> 00:04:59.475\nus the infrastructure and\ndo the build on the initial configuration.\n\n105\n00:04:59.475 --> 00:05:03.300\nSo customers rent hardware, the OS,\nthe storage, the networking, all that.\n\n106\n00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.200\nAnd we then are able to go ahead and\n\n107\n00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.870\nvirtualize on top of that,\ndoor app dev work.\n\n108\n00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.740\nWe often associate PaaS with app dev,\nbecause we think of it as being the app\n\n109\n00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.210\ndev platform that we rent and\nessentially use.\n\n110\n00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.058\nSo supporting multiple languages and\nframeworks is a key, capability and\n\n111\n00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:21.810\ncharacteristic of PaaS,\nmultiple host environments can be created,\n\n112\n00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.430\nvery flexible, we can auto scale, and\nwe allow the ability to have choice and\n\n113\n00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.100\ntherefore attempt to reduce\nwhat's called vendor lock in,\n\n114\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.950\nwhere we're stuck with one vendor and\none capability.\n\n115\n00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.430\nIf you want to run both Microsoft and\nLinux Unix based infrastructure in your\n\n116\n00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.520\nenterprise today, in the old-school model\nof doing things where you own physical\n\n117\n00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.190\ninfrastructure, you had to buy and\nprovision all that infrastructure, and\n\n118\n00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.520\nyou had to duplicate your\nservers essentially to run both.\n\n119\n00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.370\nYou know, for\ninstance traditionally in web hosting,\n\n120\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.830\nLinux really plays a very big part\nin that and has for many many years.\n\n121\n00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.550\nThat's where we see the majority of web\nhosting being done whereas in directory\n\n122\n00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.540\nservices and in messaging platforms,\nenterprise content management,\n\n123\n00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.570\nfile and print that's usually the purview\nof Microsoft more often than not.\n\n124\n00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.298\nNot exclusively but more often than not,\n\n125\n00:06:07.298 --> 00:06:11.100\nvery heavily weighted in the enterprise\nin favor of Microsoft in those areas.\n\n126\n00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.940\nSo as a result, you may buy both and\nprovision both and it's very expensive.\n\n127\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.560\nWith PaaS you just rent\nthat infrastructure and\n\n128\n00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.190\nsay I want 20 web servers,\nI want them to run Linux.\n\n129\n00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.020\nNo problem, we provision out two or three\nhosts, we give you the capability to run\n\n130\n00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.970\nfive or six VMs, guest operating systems\nper host and you provision them out.\n\n131\n00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:33.190\nAnd you got your 20 web servers, and\nyou're getting them for a lot less than if\n\n132\n00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.890\nyou had to go buy them for\nthree to five years and own them yourself.\n\n133\n00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.740\nAnd then having to have them set them up,\nhaving to license them,\n\n134\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.670\nhaving to maintain them and\n\n135\n00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.910\nupdate them over time is now being\ntransferred to the cloud service provider.\n\n136\n00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.999\nAnd for that monthly fee, they\nessentially are taking on those risks and\n\n137\n00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:49.032\nthose concerns for us.\n\n138\n00:06:49.032 --> 00:06:51.385\nSo there's a lot of value\npotentially in this model.\n\n139\n00:06:51.385 --> 00:06:53.930\nSo a lot of capabilities,\na lot of key characteristics.\n\n140\n00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.820\nSo the operating system is\nmanaged by the provider.\n\n141\n00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.050\nMeaning they do patch management,\n\n142\n00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.810\nthey do upgrades to\nthe underlying core functionality.\n\n143\n00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.050\nWouldn't it be interesting.\n\n144\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.600\nAnd again,\nthere's liability with everything.\n\n145\n00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.340\nSo take this with a grain of salt.\n\n146\n00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.830\nBut isn't it interesting in this kind of\na model where we can decide that we want\n\n147\n00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.410\nto go from Server 12 to 12 R2 or\n12 R2 to 16 or\n\n148\n00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.660\nLinux Redhat version 5 to version 7\nsimply by selecting a premade template or\n\n149\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.550\na running instance of some VM that we\ncould then upgrade and that the provider's\n\n150\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.790\nalready taken care of the licensing,\nfigured out the deployment model.\n\n151\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.230\nAll we have to do is click\na couple of buttons in theory,\n\n152\n00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.310\nmaybe write a little script or\nuse a deployment automation capability.\n\n153\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.240\nAnd 20, 30 minutes later\nwe've got a running instance.\n\n154\n00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.125\nAs opposed to I have to\ndownload the operating system.\n\n155\n00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.280\nI have to read up on how to deploy it.\n\n156\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.050\nI may or may not be able to do the scaling\nmyself or it's very complicated.\n\n157\n00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.082\nSo you know there's a lot\nof moving parts there.\n\n158\n00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:48.241\nPaaS really takes all this away,\nthe vendor is dealing with this.\n\n159\n00:07:48.241 --> 00:07:52.242\nNow the down side, the dark side is that\nyou may be forced to upgrade on a platform\n\n160\n00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:55.472\nwithout necessarily having control\nover when that occurs, and\n\n161\n00:07:55.472 --> 00:07:57.648\nthat is one of the liabilities with cloud.\n\n162\n00:07:57.648 --> 00:08:02.455\nBecause as we move further up the stack\nfrom IaaS to PaaS and ultimately to SaaS,\n\n163\n00:08:02.455 --> 00:08:06.564\nIt is the cloud service provider\nthat is controlling those levers.\n\n164\n00:08:06.564 --> 00:08:10.480\nWhen we upgrade, under what conditions and\nthe testing and the reliability and\n\n165\n00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.513\nthe patch management is all done by the\nvendor, which means essentially I may wake\n\n166\n00:08:14.513 --> 00:08:18.650\nup on Monday morning running Server 12\nR2 and next Monday I may have Server 16.\n\n167\n00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.280\nAnd I may or\nmay not have anything to say about it.\n\n168\n00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.780\nSo I do have to understand that.\n\n169\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.565\nAnd I do have to be an educated consumer.\n\n170\n00:08:24.565 --> 00:08:27.270\nWe come back to this\nidea of caveat emptor.\n\n171\n00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.780\nAs we talked about in the last episode.\n\n172\n00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.040\nRight?\nBuyer beware.\n\n173\n00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.250\nIt stipulates very clearly in those\nhosting agreements that the vendor,\n\n174\n00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.260\nthe cloud service provider is\nin control of that platform and\n\n175\n00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.380\nyou have to understand how\nto play by those rules.\n\n176\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:42.270\nNow to be fair to cloud service providers,\nthey do typically provide an opt-out and\n\n177\n00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:46.460\na deferment clause where you can push\noff that upgrade for a period of time.\n\n178\n00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:50.130\nThey do work with you, but at some point,\npush comes to shove and guess what,\n\n179\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.430\nyou're running Exchange 13 or Exchange\n16 or whatever it is on the back end.\n\n180\n00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.292\nAnd you're just gonna\nhave to make it work.\n\n181\n00:08:56.292 --> 00:08:58.650\nSo you have to give up\na certain level of control.\n\n182\n00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.820\nIn order to gain some\nof these capabilities.\n\n183\n00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.410\nAnd you want to make sure\nyou're aware of that.\n\n184\n00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.650\n>> We now feel our users, right?\n\n185\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.370\nThey tend to complain anytime-\n>> We don't care about them.\n\n186\n00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.440\n>> We do that software update.\n\n187\n00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.030\nYeah. We don't care- >> Yeah,\nthey're a bunch of pansies.\n\n188\n00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.790\n>> They care a lot.\n\n189\n00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:11.638\n>> No, they're a bunch of pansies,\nwe don't care about them.\n\n190\n00:09:11.638 --> 00:09:12.785\n>> [LAUGH] I agree, I'm with you.\n\n191\n00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:14.325\nLet's rule IT with an iron fist.\n\n192\n00:09:14.325 --> 00:09:16.527\n>> I'm a benevolent dictator\nas long as you vote my way.\n\n193\n00:09:16.527 --> 00:09:17.185\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If not,\n\n194\n00:09:17.185 --> 00:09:19.985\nyou will feel the wrath of\nthe undefined cloud, right.\n\n195\n00:09:19.985 --> 00:09:20.605\n>> That's right.\n\n196\n00:09:20.605 --> 00:09:22.595\n>> The short, but undefined cloud.\n\n197\n00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:25.025\nBut it is actually a really\ngood point all kidding aside.\n\n198\n00:09:25.025 --> 00:09:28.250\nSo users tend to bear the brunt of this\nwhich is kind of the point you were\n\n199\n00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.380\nmaking, which is that wake up on\nMonday morning and all of a sudden,\n\n200\n00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.700\nthe backend is different.\n\n201\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.560\nWe may not be changing the front\nend to kind of be equitable, right.\n\n202\n00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.310\nWe may not change\nthe front end application.\n\n203\n00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:41.790\nSo office may still be office they're\na team even though it's running,\n\n204\n00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.130\nhypothetically against Exchange 16 or\nSharePoint 16 or whatever.\n\n205\n00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.890\nBut over time, that office client\nwill then rev to version 16,\n\n206\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.070\nas it's already doing on Office 365,\n\n207\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.910\nand you have that capability, if you're\nall in buying office on the platform.\n\n208\n00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:59.510\nYou can still run Office 13 but\nyou have the right to upgrade to 16,\n\n209\n00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.180\nand over the next probably 12\nto 18 months approximately\n\n210\n00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:07.740\nyou're gonna be forced to go to Office 16,\nand eventually, Office 13 will disappear.\n\n211\n00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.080\nSo, you know, there is that point in time\nwhere for customers, especially end users,\n\n212\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.340\nas opposed to the IT professionals,\nthe CCSPs, the security professionals,\n\n213\n00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.040\npeople like us, right, that are\nessentially doing this behind the scenes,\n\n214\n00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.550\nand understand that there's\ndifferent things going on.\n\n215\n00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:27.160\nThat just you know end user information\nworker kinda doing their thing every day.\n\n216\n00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.250\nThey're in for\na nasty surprise at some point.\n\n217\n00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.980\nAnd so one of the things we have to know,\nwe have to do, really have to be aware of\n\n218\n00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.240\nas cloud professionals, is we have to\nfocus on security awareness, but also\n\n219\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.360\ntraining and awareness of the use of the\nplatform, and what's coming down the road.\n\n220\n00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.720\nCommunication becomes incredibly\nimportant for us to prepare our users,\n\n221\n00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.760\nget them essentially thinking about\nwhat change looks like and preparing for\n\n222\n00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:54.200\nthat change over time, because if we\ndon't do that, and we just have 16 subtly\n\n223\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.670\ndeploy out of the blue, while it may\nlook very similar to thirteen and,\n\n224\n00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:00.460\nyou know, for the last couple\niterations of Office, for instance,\n\n225\n00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.970\nwe've had the ribbon since Office 10 and\nthere have been minor changes.\n\n226\n00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:04.930\nThings move.\n\n227\n00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.030\nBut essentially it's all\ngonna look the same.\n\n228\n00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:10.110\nBut if you remember going from\nOffice 07 to Office 10 or\n\n229\n00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.730\nfrom 07 directly to 13 where we\ndidn't have a ribbon, right?\n\n230\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:15.080\nAnd we had menus.\n\n231\n00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.330\nThat was a tremendous change for\ncustomers.\n\n232\n00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.150\nI mean, really disruptive for\na long period of time.\n\n233\n00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.580\nTo think about Windows 7, the Vista\nWindows 7 XP world with a start menu,\n\n234\n00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.550\nand think about the brave\nnew world of Windows 8, 8.1.\n\n235\n00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:31.740\nWhere we essentially have live tiles,\nno start menu, and\n\n236\n00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.150\njust the pushback and\nthe just the groundswell of just really,\n\n237\n00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.990\nreally unhappy end users that were not\nable to deal with that effectively.\n\n238\n00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:44.070\n>> You know, Adam, I can understand the\nend user because they're not technical.\n\n239\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.770\nWe are technical people, and\n\n240\n00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.090\nseeing that the world is going cloud-based\nIt really means that we have to be a whole\n\n241\n00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:55.020\nlot more agile than we used to especially\nsince it's moving that way very quickly.\n\n242\n00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:58.200\nSo our developers, they've got to be\nup on the latest and greatest because\n\n243\n00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.220\nlike you say, you never know when\nthey're using that platform as service.\n\n244\n00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.530\nIt may jump to 2016, and\nthey're not ready for that.\n\n245\n00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.640\nThere are software breaks on that, and now\nthey have to, or they use a new platform.\n\n246\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.180\nIt's the latest Ruby on Rails.\n\n247\n00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.030\nIt's the latest version of Python that\nthey're working with and now they've gotta\n\n248\n00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:16.510\nthey've gotta kind of run and play\ncatch up to work with that environment.\n\n249\n00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.500\n>> It is and it can be a really big issue.\n\n250\n00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.720\nSo one of the things I consult with\ncustomers about all the time in this\n\n251\n00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.370\narea is if you're gonna do app dev work,\nfor instance,\n\n252\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.300\nlike you were just talking about.\n\n253\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.820\nRuby on Rails or Python or\nwhatever it is, just whatever language,\n\n254\n00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.930\npick the 200 out there that you're\ngonna work with, whatever it may be.\n\n255\n00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.480\nBut if you want to control that world but\nyou want to be in the cloud,\n\n256\n00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.600\nthey often say, okay, so you're telling\nus all this great stuff the cloud can do,\n\n257\n00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.540\nyou tell us all these horror stories about\nwhat happens when we turned it over to\n\n258\n00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.255\na vendor with no control,\nso what's the happy medium?\n\n259\n00:12:43.255 --> 00:12:46.070\nOn-Prem Private Cloud is the happy medium,\nright?\n\n260\n00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.810\nBecause you build the cloud yourself,\nyou run it On-Prem, you control it.\n\n261\n00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:53.290\nI've talked about this several times as\none option in the private cloud space\n\n262\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:57.530\nalready where IT becomes the cloud\nservice provider to the business and\n\n263\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:01.500\nthe business becomes the customer of\nthe IT function in the business, but\n\n264\n00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.770\nit's all in the business.\n\n265\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.100\nIt's all inside the enclave battery,\ninside the border of the business.\n\n266\n00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.510\nAnd so instead of getting Microsoft\nto host the cloud, you build it and\n\n267\n00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:12.830\nhost it using your own infrastructure.\n\n268\n00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.120\nYou buy the hosts.\n\n269\n00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.590\nYou use Microsoft's tools.\n\n270\n00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.660\nSo you buy System Center and you install\nSystem Center virtual machine manager.\n\n271\n00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.830\nOr you buy VMware and\nyou buy ESXI for your hosts.\n\n272\n00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.830\nAnd you deploy V-center which is\nthe equivalent competitive product.\n\n273\n00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:28.740\nAssistant center virtual machine manager.\n\n274\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.700\nAnd you run SCOM,\n\n275\n00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:33.820\nsystem center ops manager, SCCM,\nsystem center config manager.\n\n276\n00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:38.350\nOr you get HP Open View and IBM Tivali,\nor SolarWinds or whatever you want.\n\n277\n00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:40.445\nThere's 1,000 products\nout there that do this.\n\n278\n00:13:40.445 --> 00:13:43.315\nThe point is you can build it and\nmanage it yourself.\n\n279\n00:13:43.315 --> 00:13:45.175\nAnd then you don't have these issues.\n\n280\n00:13:45.175 --> 00:13:45.855\nRight?\nI mean you do.\n\n281\n00:13:45.855 --> 00:13:48.195\nBut the point is you\ncontrol the change cycle.\n\n282\n00:13:48.195 --> 00:13:53.045\nIf your business wants to stay on,\nyou know, Python version X1 for\n\n283\n00:13:53.045 --> 00:13:56.215\n12 years, you don't have to change,\nbecause you own the infrastructure.\n\n284\n00:13:56.215 --> 00:13:57.545\nIt's when you decide.\n\n285\n00:13:57.545 --> 00:13:59.375\nSo, I do this all the time for customers.\n\n286\n00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:00.205\nAnd we walk through this.\n\n287\n00:14:00.205 --> 00:14:02.700\nAnd, you know, there is concession\nthat's relatively straightforward.\n\n288\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.430\nIf you want to control the change cycle,\nyou implement private cloud on prem.\n\n289\n00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:08.340\nYou do it yourself.\n\n290\n00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.260\nIf you're willing to\nwork with a vendor and\n\n291\n00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.710\nbe ultimately beholden to their change\nschedule, you go private cloud off prem,\n\n292\n00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.280\nyou outsource or do you a hosted solution\nor a multi tenor environment and either of\n\n293\n00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.828\nthose work well but you have to be aware\nupfront of what your risk aversion is or\n\n294\n00:14:23.828 --> 00:14:27.570\nyour risk appetite is and ultimately\nwhat your pain points are as a business.\n\n295\n00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.860\nBusinesses that survive and thrive because\nthey do their own app dev it's very\n\n296\n00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:34.530\nimportant for them to control\ntheir platforms and on prem\n\n297\n00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:39.140\nprivately hosted clouds are all the rage\nand everybody is doing it today, right?\n\n298\n00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.410\nSo be like everybody else.\n\n299\n00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.090\nBe a joiner, be a sheep and go out and\nbuild yourself a private cloud on prem.\n\n300\n00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:46.150\nRight?\nBut that's a great thing to think about.\n\n301\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.290\nIt's a great observation to make.\n\n302\n00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.660\nRight?\nHow do we circle back and\n\n303\n00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:50.330\nreally understand the impact of change?\n\n304\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.060\nWe control it.\n\n305\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.480\nIf we control the range of change,\nin theory it's more palatable to us.\n\n306\n00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.980\nIt's still disruptive, but\nit's more palatable cuz we decide when and\n\n307\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.490\nthe when is really the key operational\ncharacteristic we've got to\n\n308\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:01.520\nfocus on there, right?\n\n309\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.250\nWith regards to SaaS,\nwe have a distributed software model,\n\n310\n00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.460\nwe've talked about this.\n\n311\n00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:09.030\nUsers, customers, essentially,\nare responsible for\n\n312\n00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.960\nuser management, access control, account\nprovisioning and also data provisioning,\n\n313\n00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.640\nproviding data into the system.\n\n314\n00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.800\nThe backend is managed by the CSP,\n\n315\n00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.580\nthe cloud service provider, and\nthey are in charge of everything.\n\n316\n00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.100\nSo we typically have two delivery models.\n\n317\n00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.535\nWe have what's known as a hosted\napplication model and or\n\n318\n00:15:25.535 --> 00:15:26.840\na software on demand model.\n\n319\n00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.040\nRight?\nSo, something like www.SalesForce.com is\n\n320\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.380\na hosted application model where you buy\nthe application directly from the vendor.\n\n321\n00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.280\nWeb API of some kind you interact with.\n\n322\n00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.840\nYou're given typically a frontend\nthat you get in through.\n\n323\n00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.990\nIt's probably administrative\ndashboards more often than not.\n\n324\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.190\nYou have the ability to\ndo some basic monitoring.\n\n325\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.970\nThings like user access\ncontrol is done there.\n\n326\n00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.005\nBut basically you're buying the data,\n\n327\n00:15:48.005 --> 00:15:49.413\nexcuse me you're buying the data,\nthat would be fun.\n\n328\n00:15:49.413 --> 00:15:50.010\n>> That would be awesome.\n\n329\n00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.670\n>> You're buying the application and\nthe data goes with it.\n\n330\n00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.607\nBut, you're buying it through\na hosted application model.\n\n331\n00:15:54.607 --> 00:15:57.080\nwww.Salesforce.com a pretty\nclassic example of that.\n\n332\n00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.804\nSoftware on demand, something like renting\nOffice From Microsoft through Office 365.\n\n333\n00:16:01.804 --> 00:16:05.345\nSo you get your Office subscription\ndownloaded and you install it, and\n\n334\n00:16:05.345 --> 00:16:07.240\nthen you essentially run it, right?\n\n335\n00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.570\nThat's gonna be what we get.\n\n336\n00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.730\nAnd then SharePoint in the cloud, Exchange\nin the cloud, those are hosted application\n\n337\n00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.960\nmanagement models, where all of our data\nand all the applications are up there.\n\n338\n00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.340\nSo we just want to be thinking about that,\n\n339\n00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.230\nwant to be aware of that,\nhave a sense of that.\n\n340\n00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:24.070\nSome of the benefits, ease of use\nobviously right, relatively straight\n\n341\n00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:27.280\nforward with a streamlined interface,\nminimal administrative overhead.\n\n342\n00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.490\nWe really are doing one or two things in\na SaaS model, there's really not much\n\n343\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.500\nwe have to do, automatic updates and patch\nmanagement are provided by the client or\n\n344\n00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.960\nexcuse me, by the cloud service provider.\n\n345\n00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:40.300\nWe just get out of the way so\nwhen there's a service pack upgrade or\n\n346\n00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.040\nfeature upgrade for\nExchange that gets applied in Office 365.\n\n347\n00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.780\nWe don't do anything.\n\n348\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:46.880\nWe just show up and\nall of a sudden it's there.\n\n349\n00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.530\nEssentially, more often than not.\n\n350\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.020\nStandardization and compatibility,\neverything that you are running\n\n351\n00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:55.490\nis certified so the idea is you only run\nsoftware that will work on the platform.\n\n352\n00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:58.270\nSo you don't run a crazy off in\nthe corner bizarre app that is\n\n353\n00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.640\nhomegrown that doesn't work.\n\n354\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.510\nYou run Office and\n\n355\n00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:03.870\nOffice is certified to run with whatever\nversion of the platform you have.\n\n356\n00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.850\nAnd global accessibility.\n\n357\n00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.030\nYou can get to it from anywhere.\n\n358\n00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.664\nYou use a web browser and essentially you\ncould get to Salesforce.com from anywhere\n\n359\n00:17:09.664 --> 00:17:10.550\non the planet.\n\n360\n00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:13.630\nAs long as you have web connectivity and\nyou use one of the standard browsers,\n\n361\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.060\nwhether it's Chrome, whether it's Firefox,\n\n362\n00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.660\nwhether it's I.E., maybe Edge,\nyou know the new browser the Edge browser.\n\n363\n00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.020\nMaybe it is Safari, who knows what,\nbut whatever those authorized\n\n364\n00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.160\nsoftware packages are, you use those and\nyou're able to get in no trouble.\n\n365\n00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.708\nSo that's really gonna be\nsome of the key benefits.\n\n366\n00:17:30.708 --> 00:17:33.783\nWe do have an interesting architectural\noverview piece that we want to\n\n367\n00:17:33.783 --> 00:17:34.522\nshare with you.\n\n368\n00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:36.940\nSpeaking about key benefits,\nand where they come from.\n\n369\n00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.900\nSo we're gonna go to Daniel's machine and\nput that up for us, and\n\n370\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.370\nwe're going to take a look and\nwe're gonna go full screen,\n\n371\n00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:44.500\ncuz we actually need to see everything,\nthere we go perfect.\n\n372\n00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.960\nSo, what we're gonna do is take a look at\nfrom an architecture overview perspective,\n\n373\n00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.450\nthe CSA, or Cloud Security\nAlliances Enterprise Architecture.\n\n374\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.480\nWe're gonna go back out to\nthe CSA website in a minute, but\n\n375\n00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.660\nwe're not gonna do that right now.\n\n376\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.380\nWe'll take a look at this first,\nthen we'll show you where we got it from.\n\n377\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.590\nBut what I wanna do is\njust quickly breakdown\n\n378\n00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:05.760\nthe architecture overview for you.\n\n379\n00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.470\nThis is gonna combine together for\nus elements from several different\n\n380\n00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:15.410\narchitectural areas that are gonna allow\nus to be able to see where, for instance,\n\n381\n00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:20.170\nbusiness operation and support services,\nwhat's traditionally called BOSS on\n\n382\n00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:24.300\nthe right here in the diagram is\none element of this architecture.\n\n383\n00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.640\nWe're gonna drill down and take a look at\nthis just a minute where BOSS comes from,\n\n384\n00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:32.000\nwhich is actually the SOPSA framework,\nso it's just SOPSA repackaged\n\n385\n00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.040\nwhere information technology operation and\nsupport comes from.\n\n386\n00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.940\nAs we scroll over to the right we will see\n\n387\n00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.360\nthat we have information technology\noperation and support that's called ITOS.\n\n388\n00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.000\nITOS is really just ITIL repackaged, so\nthe ITL or ITL framework and ITL is so\n\n389\n00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.300\nmuch more fun to say than ITL,\nit's great right?\n\n390\n00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.790\nSo ITL or\nITL depending on where you come from.\n\n391\n00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:52.470\nIf we continue to move over to the right,\n\n392\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.250\nwe will see a stack that is gonna\ndeal with presentation services.\n\n393\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.250\nThis is essentially going to be TOGATH,\nthe open group framework,\n\n394\n00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.830\nwhich is repackaged and then off\nto the extreme right, security and\n\n395\n00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.580\nrisk management and\nwe're gonna see that this is\n\n396\n00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.700\nthe Jericho security framework\nthat is essentially repackaged.\n\n397\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.350\nAll together coming into this overarching\n\n398\n00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.080\nenterprise security framework for\nthe cloud.\n\n399\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.980\nAnd so the CSA, the Cloud Security\nAlliance, has put together, this actually\n\n400\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:22.870\nyou can see at the upper right-hand corner\nof the screen, Version 2 of the framework.\n\n401\n00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.810\nThis is actually a slightly newer version\nout there of Version 2.12 or something,\n\n402\n00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.820\nI think, that is a little bit more\nrecent that's been updated, but\n\n403\n00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.550\nessentially looks the same way.\n\n404\n00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:37.650\nAnd the idea is that they've taken some\nof the best areas of various frameworks,\n\n405\n00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.330\nthat exist out there in IT generically\ntoday, outside of the cloud.\n\n406\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.260\nAnd have brought them together and\n\n407\n00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:48.200\npackaged them into a cloud-centric model,\nto create a cloud-focused architecture,\n\n408\n00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.920\nthat addresses the business\noperational elements.\n\n409\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:56.830\nThe service provisioning elements,\nthe presentation of services, and\n\n410\n00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.210\nthe security risk management and\nassessment of those services in the cloud.\n\n411\n00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:06.260\nSo the CSA, the cloud security alliance,\nhas partnered with ISE squared to launch\n\n412\n00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.172\nthe CCSP credential, and\nas a result of that, has, hello.\n\n413\n00:20:10.172 --> 00:20:11.530\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look at me,\n\n414\n00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:13.090\nI'm talking, that's so cool.\n\n415\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.720\nHas gone ahead and\nhas essentially partnered together, right?\n\n416\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.560\nAnd we've made, with this partnership and\nboth entities contributing to the CCSP,\n\n417\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.860\nmade this credential available\nover the last 12 to 18 months\n\n418\n00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:29.670\nthis has been in market, and\nlaunched middle to late in 2015,\n\n419\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.810\nand so the idea is that the CSA's\nproviding a lot of the background\n\n420\n00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:38.480\nelements that are supporting the knowledge\nthat is required to become a CCSP.\n\n421\n00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.620\nAnd it is really critical for\nyou to get, as a CCSP,\n\n422\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:46.100\nfamiliar with the CSA, the cloud security\nalliance, to understand the work they do.\n\n423\n00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.630\nThey're a very influential\ntrade organization and\n\n424\n00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.770\na thought leader in the cloud security\nspace and you should definitely take some\n\n425\n00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.420\ntime to understand what they provide,\nthe resources that are there.\n\n426\n00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.190\nWe will take you out and show you their\nwebsite in just a couple of minutes, but\n\n427\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.550\nI just wanted to quickly break\ndown this model for you.\n\n428\n00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.080\nGive you a sense of what's there so\n\n429\n00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.310\nif we could scroll back over\ntowards BOSS at the top there and\n\n430\n00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.330\nif we could go full screen again cuz\nwe're gonna want to be able to see that.\n\n431\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.990\nCan we scroll down a little bit just so\nwe can start to see BOSS?\n\n432\n00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:15.230\nSo what we see with the business\noperation support services\n\n433\n00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:19.610\nis really this extraction of the SOPSA\nframework to be able to bring it in and\n\n434\n00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.240\nto apply it to how we're gonna operate and\n\n435\n00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.000\nreally think through the underlying\noperational elements of the cloud.\n\n436\n00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.209\nSo we see compliance there.\n\n437\n00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:28.140\nThat's actually good.\n\n438\n00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:28.800\nThank you.\n\n439\n00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.580\nWe see Compliance and\nwe see these different categories.\n\n440\n00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.020\nWe have Audit Planning.\n\n441\n00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.810\nWe have\nInformation System Regulatory Mapping.\n\n442\n00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:37.270\nWe have different audits as you can see.\n\n443\n00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.962\nInternal, Independent, Third Party.\n\n444\n00:21:38.962 --> 00:21:40.765\nWe have planning for audits,\n\n445\n00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:43.615\nwe have the conduction of audits,\nintellectual property protection.\n\n446\n00:21:43.615 --> 00:21:47.555\nThat's all under the compliance bucket as\nwe go down, we have data governance so\n\n447\n00:21:47.555 --> 00:21:51.425\nwe have all the governance activities\nassociated with data labeling,\n\n448\n00:21:51.425 --> 00:21:53.550\nclassification categorization.\n\n449\n00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:57.210\nWe see Stewardship and\nOwnership of data, Secure Disposal.\n\n450\n00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.260\nThis is where our data\nlife cycle comes in.\n\n451\n00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.930\nWe'll talk about our data\nlife cycle at some point.\n\n452\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.680\nWe'll get to it, and we'll actually\nmention it and go through it.\n\n453\n00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.520\nBut the idea is essentially the secure\ndata life cycle stages of create, store,\n\n454\n00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.450\nuse, share, archive, and\n\n455\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.690\ndestroy are represented in\nthe Data Governance area here.\n\n456\n00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.300\nAnd we're gonna see that and\nbe able to break that out.\n\n457\n00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.750\nAs we continue down we have operational\nrisk management, human resources security.\n\n458\n00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.070\nThese are elements where\nwe apply security and\n\n459\n00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.300\nrisk awareness into different\nareas of the business.\n\n460\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.920\nYou see business continuities there on\nthe left, the risk management framework is\n\n461\n00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.450\nthere bringing that in from either\nthis directly, or framing our own, but\n\n462\n00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.470\nsomehow coming up with a risk management\nawareness, operational risk, crisis\n\n463\n00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:43.300\nmanagement, business impact analysis,\nall that's over there on the left.\n\n464\n00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.580\nOn the right we have all the things\nwe do to manage the human\n\n465\n00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.250\nresources in the organization, right.\n\n466\n00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:53.250\nSo, codes of conduct, job descriptions,\nbackground screening, employment\n\n467\n00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:57.920\nagreements, onboarding, offboarding, all\nthat kinda stuff is gonna be there, right?\n\n468\n00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.613\nAnd as we scroll down, pardon me,\n\n469\n00:22:59.613 --> 00:23:02.440\nwe're going to have security\nmonitoring services there.\n\n470\n00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.140\nSo we're going to have the ability\nto do continuous monitoring and\n\n471\n00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:06.670\noperational management.\n\n472\n00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.598\nSIEM is there,\nwe can see it off to the left at the top.\n\n473\n00:23:09.598 --> 00:23:13.213\nSo security information,\nevent management, data base monitoring,\n\n474\n00:23:13.213 --> 00:23:16.648\napplication monitoring,\nhoney potting, end point protection,\n\n475\n00:23:16.648 --> 00:23:20.624\ncounter threat management, which we\nthink of as threat intelligence today,\n\n476\n00:23:20.624 --> 00:23:23.120\nkind of just an updated\nway of dealing with that.\n\n477\n00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:27.137\nOur SOCK or secure operations\nthought process, cloud monitoring,\n\n478\n00:23:27.137 --> 00:23:32.054\nsmack right there in the middle, real time\ninternetwork defense, things like SCAP\n\n479\n00:23:32.054 --> 00:23:36.697\nwhich is the mist protocol for secure\napplication monitoring and management,\n\n480\n00:23:36.697 --> 00:23:40.092\nuser behavior & profile patterning,\nanti-phishing,\n\n481\n00:23:40.092 --> 00:23:43.390\nall these things are part\nof security monitoring.\n\n482\n00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.500\nWe would see a Managed Security Service\nprovider and\n\n483\n00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.549\nconsuming security as a service,\n\n484\n00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:53.439\nCCAS under Security Monitoring Services\nhere in the cloud, so we would see that.\n\n485\n00:23:53.439 --> 00:23:57.769\nAs we scroll down we have Legal and\nwe have Internal Investigations, so\n\n486\n00:23:57.769 --> 00:24:01.531\nwe see all the different areas,\nE-Discovery, Forensics.\n\n487\n00:24:01.531 --> 00:24:02.449\nIncident response,\n\n488\n00:24:02.449 --> 00:24:05.257\nyou know all the things that we know\nwe need are all gonna be there.\n\n489\n00:24:05.257 --> 00:24:08.630\nAnd as we continue down,\nI believe right at the bottom.\n\n490\n00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.310\nExactly.\nSo I just wanna make sure we were there.\n\n491\n00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.810\nSo we have all of that stuff for BOSS and\nthen as we move over into ITOS we're gonna\n\n492\n00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.050\nkinda realign, come back up,\nscroll over and move back down.\n\n493\n00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:21.800\nWe're bringing in ITIL or\nwhat is repackaged into ITOS, but\n\n494\n00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.310\nis essentially ITIL.\n\n495\n00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:28.510\nSo the IT operational area, DRP, then IT\ngovernance, disaster recovery planning,\n\n496\n00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:32.445\nIT governance, portfolio management,\nthe PMO, Resource Management,\n\n497\n00:24:32.445 --> 00:24:36.205\nthese are all the security areas that\nwe focus on as we continue down.\n\n498\n00:24:37.355 --> 00:24:38.865\nWe see Service Delivery.\n\n499\n00:24:38.865 --> 00:24:42.485\nSo we're gonna see at the top, we're\nthinking about the strategy involved.\n\n500\n00:24:42.485 --> 00:24:44.135\nThat's the first life cycle area.\n\n501\n00:24:44.135 --> 00:24:45.685\nNow we're seeing delivery, so\n\n502\n00:24:45.685 --> 00:24:47.485\nwe're gonna be thinking about\nService Level Management,\n\n503\n00:24:47.485 --> 00:24:51.485\nwe're gonna think about Application\nPerformance Monitoring, Asset Management.\n\n504\n00:24:51.485 --> 00:24:54.545\nThese are all the areas where we are\nbringing in the various stages of the life\n\n505\n00:24:54.545 --> 00:24:59.470\ncycle, availability managements there,\ncapacity planning, vendor management,\n\n506\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.040\ninternal and external SLAs,\nOLAs under service level management.\n\n507\n00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.330\nOLA's operational level agreements\nare internal facing SLAs.\n\n508\n00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:12.280\nThey are essentially SLAs between\nthe business unit and the IT provider\n\n509\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.570\nas opposed to an SLA which is between\nthe business and an external provider.\n\n510\n00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.060\nSo, we see all those capabilities there.\n\n511\n00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.800\nAs we continue to scroll down,\n\n512\n00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.240\nwe're gonna see below Asset Management\nbelow Application Performance Monitoring.\n\n513\n00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.390\nWe see support, Self Configuration\nManagement, Incident and\n\n514\n00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.560\nProblem Management are represented here.\n\n515\n00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.360\nAll the areas of the actual life cycle\nwithin ITIL in the five distinct areas and\n\n516\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.910\nall the things that go into\nthem are gonna be listed here.\n\n517\n00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:41.030\nAs we continue down We will see Knowledge\nManagement, we'll see Change Management,\n\n518\n00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:45.060\nwe'll see Release Management, can't do\nRisk Management without Change Management.\n\n519\n00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.790\nThe two are mirror images of one another\nand are interlocked in such a way that\n\n520\n00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.820\nthey mutually reinforce and\nsupport one another.\n\n521\n00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:55.240\nSo we need that, so we're gonna see\nall that there, as we kinda reset,\n\n522\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.510\nscroll up and over.\n\n523\n00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.570\nWe're gonna see that we're\ngoing to be going in.\n\n524\n00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:02.270\nAnd we're gonna be taking a look\nat the presentation areas.\n\n525\n00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.640\nAnd you're gonna have to kinda come\nout a little bit for that one.\n\n526\n00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.070\nWe'll just high level it, not a big deal.\n\n527\n00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.720\nCuz there's so much of it there.\n\n528\n00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.609\nBut we're gonna see\nthe presentation services.\n\n529\n00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.530\nWe're gonna see the application\nservices as we continue down,\n\n530\n00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:18.010\nwe're gonna see information services,\ninfrastructure services.\n\n531\n00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:22.090\nThese are all coming from Togath, the open\ngroup framework that's gonna allow us to\n\n532\n00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:25.410\nunderstand how to view all these\nactivities in the business and\n\n533\n00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:26.740\ncategorize them.\n\n534\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.120\nAnd so we can see all the things that\ngo on, service delivery, reporting,\n\n535\n00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.640\nyou'll see ITOS, so ITOS brought in there.\n\n536\n00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.230\nSecurity monitoring,\ngovernance, BOSS is in there.\n\n537\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.543\nSo we're seeing the,\n\n538\n00:26:37.543 --> 00:26:42.184\nyou know the sops of framework being\nbrought in up under application services.\n\n539\n00:26:42.184 --> 00:26:44.789\nAnd information services\nas we continue down, and\n\n540\n00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:48.080\nthen ultimately infrastructure\nservices at the bottom.\n\n541\n00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.250\nWe're managing everything all up and\nit's all becoming categorized and\n\n542\n00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.012\nconsumable as one of the four\nelements of the Togath model and\n\n543\n00:26:55.012 --> 00:26:57.400\nthen as we scroll over to\nthe far right to the last area.\n\n544\n00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.360\nWe're going to Security and\nRisk Management and\n\n545\n00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.244\nwe are essentially seeing the Jericho\nSecurity model being re-positioned.\n\n546\n00:27:04.244 --> 00:27:08.340\nAnd essentially repackaged here and you'll\nsee recurring themes; Governance Risk and\n\n547\n00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.340\nCompliances there,\nInfoSec Management is there, right?\n\n548\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.030\nWe may wanna zoom in just a little bit\nmore, cuz it's essentially that narrowly\n\n549\n00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.970\ndefined rectangle, so we could\nprobably make it a little bit bigger.\n\n550\n00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.900\nSo you'll see the Risk Dashboard's there,\n\n551\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.990\nCapability Mapping is there,\nas we continue down Privilege Management.\n\n552\n00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.870\nSo we're gonna have Identity Management,\nso IM, Identity Authentication, or\n\n553\n00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.020\nidentity and access management,\nAuthorization Services,\n\n554\n00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:33.990\nprivilege use, Authorization.\n\n555\n00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.461\nThings like smartcards,\nbiometrics, single sign-on,\n\n556\n00:27:37.461 --> 00:27:43.270\nyou know role based management, XACML and\nXAML, the security assertion languages and\n\n557\n00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:47.970\nmarkup languages for\nfederation as well as for\n\n558\n00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.880\nclaims based authentication,\ntoken based authentication.\n\n559\n00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.810\nAnd here all these things\nwill occur in the cloud.\n\n560\n00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:55.510\nThreat and vulnerability\nmanagement as we continue down, so\n\n561\n00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.810\ncompliance testing, risk management,\nvulnerability management, pen testing.\n\n562\n00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.340\nSo we are going to have our active\nmonitoring capability management here.\n\n563\n00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:05.680\nWe have infrastructure\nprotection services.\n\n564\n00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:10.250\nSo things like IDSs IPSs,\nantivirus, anti Malware.\n\n565\n00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:11.290\nHIPS and HIDS are there.\n\n566\n00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.660\nSo host based IP and IDS.\n\n567\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.290\nWhite listing, black listing, inventory\ncontrol, any or all of these things, along\n\n568\n00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:23.090\nwith VLANing, tunneling, encryption on the\nnetwork side, they're all gonna be there.\n\n569\n00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:24.148\nAll right, I'm gonna see all that.\n\n570\n00:28:24.148 --> 00:28:26.938\nAnd we're going to go down and\ncontinue on with data protection and so\n\n571\n00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:31.730\nwe have DLP, data loss prevention,\nwe have intellectual property protection.\n\n572\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:36.430\nCryptographic services with key\nmanagement, PKI, digitally signing,\n\n573\n00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.520\nasymmetric and symmetric encryption,\nso single-key, dual-key of the private\n\n574\n00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.940\nkey pairs, policy and standard base\nmanagement towards the bottom there.\n\n575\n00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.880\nAs we continue down where we've got\nour ability to be strategic and\n\n576\n00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.110\ncreate policies that are gonna drive and\n\n577\n00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.960\nalign the business with regulatory\ncompliance and external standards, right?\n\n578\n00:28:55.960 --> 00:29:00.690\nSo all this stuff together is gonna be\npart of what's known as the CSA enterprise\n\n579\n00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.260\narchitecture.\n\n580\n00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.480\nIt's really important.\n\n581\n00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.410\nFor CCSPs to know and\nunderstand where these elements come from,\n\n582\n00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:11.360\nthat Boss is gonna be part of,\nfor instance, SPSA, right.\n\n583\n00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.970\nAnd that the presentation services\nare gonna be part of TOGAF,\n\n584\n00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.180\nthat ITOS is essentially ITIL,\nand that security and\n\n585\n00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.190\nrisk management is going to be Jericho or\nthe Jericho framework, right.\n\n586\n00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:26.730\nAnd so as a result of that, we wanna make\nsure we understand how to read the CSA.\n\n587\n00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.890\nLet's take a look at the,\nif we could just for a minute,\n\n588\n00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.010\nDaniel, since you're driving.\n\n589\n00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:34.730\nIf we could go to the CSA website where\nwe actually found this initially.\n\n590\n00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:40.030\nSo the Cloud Security Alliance website,\ncloudsecurityalliance.org, all one word.\n\n591\n00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:43.192\nDefinitely a website as a CCSP\nthat you wanna be familiar with,\n\n592\n00:29:43.192 --> 00:29:47.750\nshould put it in your favorites, bookmark\nit, be there on a pretty consistent basis.\n\n593\n00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:50.150\nThey've got a lot of resources as I said.\n\n594\n00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.210\nThe CSA has partnered with\nIS squared to launch and\n\n595\n00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.320\nto code the brand if you will the CCSP.\n\n596\n00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.580\nSo they are both contributing\nto the CCSP credential and\n\n597\n00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.930\nit's something that you want to be\naware of and make sure you understand,\n\n598\n00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.475\nin terms of where this\narchitecture comes from.\n\n599\n00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:08.605\nNow, what we did to find it was,\nwe simply went to the CSA website and\n\n600\n00:30:08.605 --> 00:30:10.845\nwe searched for\nenterprise security architecture.\n\n601\n00:30:10.845 --> 00:30:13.095\nThat search window at the upper\nright hand corner and\n\n602\n00:30:13.095 --> 00:30:16.040\nwe found a list of resources and\nwe simply clicked through.\n\n603\n00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.840\nDownloaded it,\nyou don't even need an account,\n\n604\n00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.180\nyou just simply click on the link and\nit shows up.\n\n605\n00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:25.450\nAnd you can look at and actually see\nthe infographic, right, for the thing.\n\n606\n00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.260\nNow we'll if I'm not mistaken\nwe can provide some of those as\n\n607\n00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.642\nresources after the show right?\n\n608\n00:30:29.642 --> 00:30:30.190\n>> Yeah no problem.\n\n609\n00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:32.830\n>> So we'll actually download that and\njust have that available for you as one of\n\n610\n00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:35.090\nthe things you can get from the\n>> show notes, if you're interested.\n\n611\n00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:36.390\nBut remember, keep in mind, and\n\n612\n00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:40.110\nwe often talk about this,\nthere may be an update over time.\n\n613\n00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.580\nTo that it may,\nyou'll be revised by the vendor.\n\n614\n00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.110\nYou always want to go out to the website,\nget the latest version.\n\n615\n00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.850\nEven though, at the time we're shooting\nthis, live right, it may actually be\n\n616\n00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:51.280\nversion two by the time you see it\nsix months later, whenever it is.\n\n617\n00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.080\nThere may have been an update.\n\n618\n00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.360\nSo just remember to go out and check for\nthe latest version of that, right?\n\n619\n00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.970\nJust to make sure you're gonna\nget it directly from the vendor.\n\n620\n00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.260\nBut we're really defining the protections\nthat enable trust in the cloud.\n\n621\n00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:02.700\nBy using this architecture.\n\n622\n00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.480\nDefining the scope of what\ncloud security means and\n\n623\n00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.040\nultimately how we're gonna envision that.\n\n624\n00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.600\nSo it's very, very important for us.\n\n625\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.580\n>> To think about that helps us also to\nlay out a Cloud technology road map, and\n\n626\n00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.660\nreally understand not only the moving\nparts and the trust involved.\n\n627\n00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.870\nBut the methodologies, the sets of tools,\nthe common sets of solutions, and\n\n628\n00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:22.430\nultimately the ability to\nassess security capabilities.\n\n629\n00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.204\nThat's really what the enterprise\nsecurity architecture does for us,\n\n630\n00:31:25.204 --> 00:31:27.749\nat least logically that's what\nwe're thinking about it doing and\n\n631\n00:31:27.749 --> 00:31:29.711\nmaking sure that we understand\nthe concepts of it.\n\n632\n00:31:29.711 --> 00:31:33.294\nRemember, in the cloud security\narchitecture, we've talked about network\n\n633\n00:31:33.294 --> 00:31:36.400\nsecurity, we talked about the physical\nenvironment a little bit.\n\n634\n00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.589\nThere were elements in there that\nwould speak to physical security and\n\n635\n00:31:39.589 --> 00:31:43.102\nour data centers, the standard things\nwe think about separation of duties,\n\n636\n00:31:43.102 --> 00:31:44.685\nmaking sure we have job rotation.\n\n637\n00:31:44.685 --> 00:31:46.703\nMaking sure we have access control,\n\n638\n00:31:46.703 --> 00:31:50.622\nmaking sure we don't allow people\ninto the area where we host the data.\n\n639\n00:31:50.622 --> 00:31:54.559\nSo we have closed circuit TV's, gates,\nguards, guns, we often talk about.\n\n640\n00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:55.964\nIn the physical security world.\n\n641\n00:31:55.964 --> 00:31:57.484\nSo, we have those kinda things.\n\n642\n00:31:57.484 --> 00:32:00.660\nBut then we also have\nlogical security controls.\n\n643\n00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.932\nWe talked about things like VPNs and\n\n644\n00:32:02.932 --> 00:32:04.990\ntunneling and encryption and\ndigitally signing.\n\n645\n00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.970\nSo, all these things, logical and physical\nnetworks security controls were there.\n\n646\n00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.660\nWe talked about network perimeters,\n\n647\n00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.430\nmaking sure we have a perimeter\nthat's clearly demarcated.\n\n648\n00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.120\nWhat is available in the private\nCloud should not be made available in\n\n649\n00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.150\nthe public Cloud.\n\n650\n00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:20.390\nWhat's in the public Cloud should not\nbe moved into the private Cloud without\n\n651\n00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.710\naccess control and oversight and\nchange management.\n\n652\n00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:25.350\nSo, wanna worry about integrity.\n\n653\n00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.370\nWanna worry about availability.\n\n654\n00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:28.360\nWanna worry about confidentiality of data.\n\n655\n00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.970\nAnd this was all represented\nin there as well.\n\n656\n00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:33.500\nWe talked about the use and\nvalue of encryption, right?\n\n657\n00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.970\nSo, we pointed out that there were areas\nthere, especially in the security risk and\n\n658\n00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.770\nmanagement portion of the architecture and\nthe Jericho framework that spoke to PKI,\n\n659\n00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:44.480\nthat spoke to encryption,\nthe use of both asymmetric and\n\n660\n00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.165\nsymmetric keys and things of that nature.\n\n661\n00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:50.555\nEncryption, remember, is gonna be one\nof the best protection mechanisms for\n\n662\n00:32:50.555 --> 00:32:54.375\ndata in use, data at rest and\ndata in transit.\n\n663\n00:32:54.375 --> 00:32:56.737\nAll three areas of the data life cycle.\n\n664\n00:32:56.737 --> 00:32:59.315\nWe wanna think about the fact\nthat when data is being used,\n\n665\n00:32:59.315 --> 00:33:00.455\nit should be encrypted.\n\n666\n00:33:00.455 --> 00:33:03.065\nSo, applications should be encryption\naware and encryption friendly.\n\n667\n00:33:03.065 --> 00:33:06.201\nWhen we're transiting data across\nthe wire, we wanna encrypt it,\n\n668\n00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:07.914\nwanna tunnel it, wanna protect it.\n\n669\n00:33:07.914 --> 00:33:11.028\nAnd when it is in storage, long and\nshort and medium term storage,\n\n670\n00:33:11.028 --> 00:33:12.093\nwe should encrypt it.\n\n671\n00:33:12.093 --> 00:33:15.880\nSo that way, if somebody does get access\nto the data, it's highly unlikely that\n\n672\n00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.790\nthey will be able to use the data\nwithout the encryption keys.\n\n673\n00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.150\nMakes it a lot more difficult for\nthem to do that.\n\n674\n00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:24.490\nSo, we talked about data in transit,\ndata in use, data at rest before.\n\n675\n00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.960\nMaking sure we're aware of that.\n\n676\n00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.330\nWe've talked about key management.\n\n677\n00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.390\nIn the framework,\nyou saw the value of key management.\n\n678\n00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:33.280\nAgain, off to the right-hand\nside in the Jericho portion,\n\n679\n00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.380\nthe security risk and management area,\nwhere we talked about PKI and\n\n680\n00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.780\ntalked about key management specifically,\nand why those are important.\n\n681\n00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.050\nIf we don't have good key management,\nthere's no way for\n\n682\n00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:43.610\nus to use encryption properly.\n\n683\n00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:47.150\nWe may get lucky, but chance good\nsomebody will compromise that key and\n\n684\n00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.530\nthat leads to all sorts of concerns,\nright?\n\n685\n00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:52.838\nFor instance, you ever lose your house key\nor your car key or something like that?\n\n686\n00:33:52.838 --> 00:33:54.510\nAnd you've gotta make a copy of it?\n\n687\n00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.340\nSo, you have that extra\ncopy laying around.\n\n688\n00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.320\nSomebody may find the key.\n\n689\n00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.230\nThose are the things you've\ngotta worry about, right?\n\n690\n00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.050\nAnd you gotta be concerned about that.\n\n691\n00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:06.210\nI remember growing up, for years when\nI was old enough to essentially leave\n\n692\n00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:09.600\nthe house on my own and maybe be left\nhome alone, but I wasn't an adult yet.\n\n693\n00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.621\nSo, I was in that 15, 16,\n17 year old kind of range.\n\n694\n00:34:12.621 --> 00:34:15.830\nWas going to high school,\ncoming home on my own, that kind of thing.\n\n695\n00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:16.680\nI had a house key.\n\n696\n00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.970\nAt that point my parents trusted me,\n\n697\n00:34:17.970 --> 00:34:20.550\nfoolish though they were,\nthey trusted me with a house key.\n\n698\n00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.640\nSo, I could come and go.\n\n699\n00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.660\nBut we always had a spare key outside in\none of those little mag boxes attached\n\n700\n00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:27.870\nsomewhere so it was hidden.\n\n701\n00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.540\nSo, if you got locked out you\ncould always get back in.\n\n702\n00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.500\nThat kind of thing.\n\n703\n00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.810\nSo, you have to think about that.\n\n704\n00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.100\nThat's part of good key management, right?\n\n705\n00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.460\nAnd today, it's really, really important.\n\n706\n00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.980\nWe have to understand those things.\n\n707\n00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.870\nDo we use remote key management services?\n\n708\n00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:42.480\nDo we use client side\nkey management services?\n\n709\n00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.950\nWe haven't gotten into these details yet,\nwe will in upcoming conversations.\n\n710\n00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.120\nBut we have to think about this, right?\n\n711\n00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:50.640\nIf we're using client side key\nmanagement services, we, as the client,\n\n712\n00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.940\nare controlling the encryption keys.\n\n713\n00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.520\nIf we're using remote key management\nservices, the vendor, the CSP,\n\n714\n00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.980\nmay actually be providing them.\n\n715\n00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.530\nMost CSPs don't wanna be in\nthis business cuz they wanna\n\n716\n00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.070\nhave nothing to do with our data\nother than the bare minimum.\n\n717\n00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.470\nSo, they'll host it, but they don't wanna\nhave responsibility for decrypting it cuz\n\n718\n00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.770\nit takes away a lot of the liability and\nconcern from a risk perspective from them.\n\n719\n00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.840\nSo, they're gonna push key management,\ntypically, back to us.\n\n720\n00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.220\nSo, we have to be prepared for\nthat as a Cloud customer, and\n\n721\n00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:17.270\nunderstand that if we're\nnot good at key management,\n\n722\n00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.280\nwe may actually have\na fundamental problem, right?\n\n723\n00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.555\nWe may actually have an issue,\n\n724\n00:35:20.555 --> 00:35:22.560\nwe may not be able to use\nthe Cloud service correctly.\n\n725\n00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.250\nAccess control.\n\n726\n00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.680\nWe looked at that,\nit was in several places in the model.\n\n727\n00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.140\nIdentity and access management and\nthe ability to control who's gonna see our\n\n728\n00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.150\ndata, what they're gonna do with it and\nhow they're gonna consume it.\n\n729\n00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.200\nRuns through every aspect\nof that architecture.\n\n730\n00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.460\nIt's in every area.\n\n731\n00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.400\nIn the ITOS area for ITEL.\n\n732\n00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:42.260\nIn the BOSS area for and\n\n733\n00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.570\nin the third tier over for.\n\n734\n00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.070\nWe're thinking about\npresentation services.\n\n735\n00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:50.310\nI have to move left to right,\nand I've jumped ahead, so\n\n736\n00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.450\nI was kind of in the middle.\n\n737\n00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.990\nCouldn't remember exactly\nwhere I was going.\n\n738\n00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:56.320\nI'm sure enough often very right in\nthe security risk management area in\n\n739\n00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.490\nthe Jericho framework as\nwe add all four together.\n\n740\n00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.210\nWe see access control everywhere.\n\n741\n00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.300\nAnd we know how important access\ncontrol is, not just in the Cloud, but\n\n742\n00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.410\nin general, right?\n\n743\n00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.780\nWe can't really run any\nkind of security perimeter,\n\n744\n00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:10.340\nany kind of infrastructure today,\nwithout identity and access management.\n\n745\n00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.530\nAnd remember the phases, right,\n\n746\n00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:16.200\nof identity in access management with\nregards to the life cycle of identity,\n\n747\n00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.465\nis we identify, we authenticate and\nthen we authorize, right?\n\n748\n00:36:20.465 --> 00:36:21.835\nAnd we have to make sure\nwe understand that.\n\n749\n00:36:21.835 --> 00:36:24.735\nAnd then, we access, typically,\nthe last days for access.\n\n750\n00:36:24.735 --> 00:36:26.035\nSo, we wanna know that.\n\n751\n00:36:26.035 --> 00:36:28.095\nAnd we wanna know that during IM,\nidentity and\n\n752\n00:36:28.095 --> 00:36:30.935\naccess management, we have to think\nabout provisioning and deprovisioning.\n\n753\n00:36:30.935 --> 00:36:33.895\nWe have to think about centralizing\ndirectory services, right?\n\n754\n00:36:33.895 --> 00:36:37.525\nSome sort of LDAP service, whether it's\nMicrosoft's Active Directory directory\n\n755\n00:36:37.525 --> 00:36:40.410\nservice or\nan open LDAP service could be used.\n\n756\n00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:44.880\nPrivileged user management, and\nauthorization and access management.\n\n757\n00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.700\nThese are the IM phased areas\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n758\n00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.230\nAnd they're represented in every\narea of that architecture.\n\n759\n00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.900\nSo, we have to pick up on these things,\nwe have to understand them.\n\n760\n00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.635\nWe also have to think\nabout the data lifecycle.\n\n761\n00:36:54.635 --> 00:36:57.475\nI quickly rattled off for\nyou what that lifecycle would look like.\n\n762\n00:36:57.475 --> 00:37:00.405\nWe're gonna come back to it in\nsome of our later conversations.\n\n763\n00:37:00.405 --> 00:37:03.955\nBut dealing with data from,\nessentially, creation through usage,\n\n764\n00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:06.815\nstorage, management, monitoring,\nall the way through to the end\n\n765\n00:37:06.815 --> 00:37:11.185\nto safe disposal with media,\nsanitization and data removal is very,\n\n766\n00:37:11.185 --> 00:37:15.305\nvery important and represented in the\narchitecture as well, in various areas,\n\n767\n00:37:15.305 --> 00:37:18.510\nusually towards the bottom of each\nof those architectural elements.\n\n768\n00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.220\nSo, we have to be thinking about data and\nmedia sanitization.\n\n769\n00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.690\nHow do we deal with for instance, right?\n\n770\n00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.940\nThe ability to be able to deal with,\nin the Cloud, something that we take for\n\n771\n00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.780\ngranted when we own a computer.\n\n772\n00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.820\nIf I put data on my desktop, on my laptop,\nright, and I then go ahead and\n\n773\n00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:36.490\ndelete that data, I'm not really deleting\nit, I'm simply removing the pointer in\n\n774\n00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.130\nthe file allocation system that\nshows the graphical interface,\n\n775\n00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.760\nthe Windows Explorer where the file is.\n\n776\n00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.130\nBut it's still on the hard drive.\n\n777\n00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.835\nBut if I control that hard drive, nobody\nreally can gain access to it but me.\n\n778\n00:37:46.835 --> 00:37:49.530\nAnd over time, that file's probably\ngonna be disappeared, right?\n\n779\n00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:50.710\nIt's gonna be overwritten.\n\n780\n00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:52.400\nBut in the Cloud, how do I know?\n\n781\n00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.900\nI don't control the storage.\n\n782\n00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.380\nI have no access to it except remotely\nthrough an API, and I certainly don't know\n\n783\n00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.780\nwhat the vendor does, the Cloud\nservice provider does, to remove data.\n\n784\n00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.830\nSo, if they tell me they removed it,\ndo I trust them?\n\n785\n00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.040\nHow do I know?\n\n786\n00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.480\nI don't know, it's hard to say.\n\n787\n00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.380\nI mean, I know because I do this.\n\n788\n00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:11.830\nBut you don't know that I know.\n\n789\n00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:12.860\nIf you know what I mean, right?\n\n790\n00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.580\nSo, now that you're thoroughly confused,\nright?\n\n791\n00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.500\nNobody knows anything.\n\n792\n00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:16.220\nBut you get the idea.\n\n793\n00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.180\nI mean, this can become really confusing.\n\n794\n00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:20.310\nHow do we, as the customer, validate and\n\n795\n00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:23.150\ncertify that the vendor actually\nsecurely removed our data?\n\n796\n00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:26.360\nIt's very difficult in some cases,\nunless we negotiate that ahead of time.\n\n797\n00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.660\nAnd even then,\nit may be difficult to validate.\n\n798\n00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.470\nWe may have to take extreme measures, like\ndoing cryptoshredding of our data, which\n\n799\n00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:37.230\nwe'll talk about in a future episode,\nto ensure the data is left behind.\n\n800\n00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:39.850\nAnd let me be clear,\nwe are ensuring the data is left behind.\n\n801\n00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.400\nWhich sounds counter-intuitive, but\nwe'll explain why that's important later.\n\n802\n00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.350\nBut we ensure the data's left behind,\nbut ensure it's left behind\n\n803\n00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.305\nin a secure state that cannot\nbe compromised by a third party.\n\n804\n00:38:49.305 --> 00:38:52.810\nCuz, essentially, we're gonna re-encrypt\nthe data and destroy the encryption keys,\n\n805\n00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.625\nleaving behind encrypted\ndata that nobody can get to.\n\n806\n00:38:54.625 --> 00:38:57.402\nAnd so, we call this crypto-shredding,\nwhich is kinda cool.\n\n807\n00:38:57.402 --> 00:38:58.240\nAnd finally,\n\n808\n00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.020\nwe also talked about abrogating or\nminimizing, right, vendor lock it.\n\n809\n00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.730\nProviding capabilities to\nmove between platforms.\n\n810\n00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:06.770\nEarly on in the Cloud,\n\n811\n00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:10.400\none of the big concerns people had was\nthey'd jump into this Cloud platform and\n\n812\n00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.421\nthey wouldn't be able to migrate carefully\nor quickly and move their data off.\n\n813\n00:39:14.421 --> 00:39:17.170\nAnd they would essentially get\nstuck hosting with Google or\n\n814\n00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.810\nAmazon or whoever, right?\n\n815\n00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:22.895\nAnd while that's really changed today, and\nthat's not necessarily the case, vendor\n\n816\n00:39:22.895 --> 00:39:26.250\nlock-in is still potentially an issue\nin some of these proprietary platforms.\n\n817\n00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.280\nAnd I'm not in any way\nsaying that somebody or\n\n818\n00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:33.530\na group like Salesforce.com when I mention\nan application hosted provider may\n\n819\n00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.730\nfoster application lock-in just\nby the way they do business.\n\n820\n00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:37.705\nI'm not suggesting that at all.\n\n821\n00:39:37.705 --> 00:39:39.510\nWanna be clear, I wanna be fair.\n\n822\n00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:44.409\nI'm just pointing out that platforms like\nthe SaaS hosted application models tend to\n\n823\n00:39:44.409 --> 00:39:48.990\nstill deal with vendor lock-in a lot\nmore than IaaS and PaaS platforms do.\n\n824\n00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:52.350\nBecause IaaS and pass today is fairly\nubiquitous and it's pretty portable.\n\n825\n00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.500\nYou can get it anywhere.\n\n826\n00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:57.629\nBut when you put your data into a SaaS\nmodel, and you're using that vendor's\n\n827\n00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:00.980\nAPIs, it's a lot more difficult\nto move your data quickly, and\n\n828\n00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:04.092\nyou do still have to worry about\nthings like vendor lock-in.\n\n829\n00:40:04.092 --> 00:40:07.380\nThis becomes a major,\nmajor issue and concern for us.\n\n830\n00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.640\nInteroperability and vendor lock-in\nare huge, huge issues, right?\n\n831\n00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:16.490\nAnd we see those being represented in the\ndiscussion of the architecture, as well.\n\n832\n00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:18.110\nData provisioning, right?\n\n833\n00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:18.990\nData control.\n\n834\n00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.860\nData movement.\n\n835\n00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.222\nWe may take that for\ngranted in the non-Cloud space.\n\n836\n00:40:22.222 --> 00:40:25.610\nWe gotta be aware of that in the Cloud\nspace as Cloud security professionals, and\n\n837\n00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.538\nreally understand the risks\nassociated with that.\n\n838\n00:40:27.538 --> 00:40:29.580\n>> Well, Adam, lots of information.\n\n839\n00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:32.480\nI know it can feel like you're\ndrinking from a firehose, right?\n\n840\n00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.570\nIt's on full blast and\nyou're just getting plastered in the face.\n\n841\n00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.500\nBut the good thing is,\nwe're just giving you a general idea of\n\n842\n00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:42.360\nhow we're gonna attack these concepts and\nwhat you need to be prepared for\n\n843\n00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:46.990\nas we further go into them And we will\nilluminate you a little bit more on how\n\n844\n00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:50.510\nthey work, how we use them to our\nbenefit and our environments.\n\n845\n00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.020\nAdam, again, a fantastic job.\n\n846\n00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.390\nWe thank you for dropping by and\nexplaining these things to us.\n\n847\n00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.980\nWe look forward to the more in\ndepth study of these things and\n\n848\n00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:01.060\nhow we can utilize them to our\nbenefits in our Cloud environments.\n\n849\n00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.330\nThat being said, looks like we've\nwrapped up yet another one.\n\n850\n00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.480\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n851\n00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.234\nFor ITProTV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n852\n00:41:07.234 --> 00:41:08.813\n>> And I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n853\n00:41:08.813 --> 00:41:10.796\n>> And we will see you next time.\n\n854\n00:41:10.796 --> 00:41:18.410\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n00:00:16.477 --> 00:00:20.495\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.270\ncertified cloud security\nprofessional series.\n\n00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.460\nSo, Adam is back in the studio\nto help us out with that.\n\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.897\nGoing into part five.\n\n00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:28.197\nIt's our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:30.217\nAdam, welcome back, and how's it going?\n\n00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:31.770\n>> Five times.\n\n00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.717\n>> That's right.\n\n00:00:31.717 --> 00:00:32.317\n>> Five times.\n\n00:00:32.317 --> 00:00:32.957\n>> Cinco.\n\n00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:34.757\n[LAUGH]\n>> Cinco, Cinco de Mayo.\n\n00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:36.217\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's going well, it's going well.\n\n00:00:36.217 --> 00:00:39.488\nSo hopefully everybody out there\nhas been enjoying our conversation,\n\n00:00:39.488 --> 00:00:42.214\nour evolving conversation,\njust like the cloud evolves,\n\n00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:46.210\nour evolving conversation with regards to\nthe cloud, cloud security all the basics.\n\n00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.635\nRemember we're really right now in\nthis group of episodes dealing with\n\n00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:53.288\nthe foundational elements of cloud\nsecurity that the aspiring CCSP needs to\n\n00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:56.424\nunderstand, needs to be aware of,\nneeds to bring to the table and\n\n00:00:56.424 --> 00:01:00.507\nreally have a good mastery of, in order to\nmove then forward into the other domains.\n\n00:01:00.507 --> 00:01:04.847\nThe other areas of the CCSP credential\nthat we're gonna spend time on in future\n\n00:01:04.847 --> 00:01:07.674\nepisodes, talking about\noperational security,\n\n00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:12.460\napplication based security in the cloud,\narchitecture, risk management.\n\n00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.830\nAll those things are themes, they're\nall gonna be given their due course and\n\n00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.500\ndue conversation.\n\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.200\nBut we're laying down the building\nblocks and really touching in and\n\n00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.000\non as Daniel may clear\nall these areas as we go.\n\n00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.530\nSo continuing that thought process,\ncontinuing on.\n\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530\nWe left off in our last episode talking\nabout the enterprise security alliance,\n\n00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.860\nenterprise security alliance,\nthe Cloud Security Alliance and\n\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.360\nenterprise security architecture.\n\n00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.320\nI'm making things up as I go literally.\n\n00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.470\nSo we left off talking about the CSA,\nthe Cloud Security Alliance's\n\n00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.800\nenterprise architecture and\nthe building blocks of it.\n\n00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.950\nWe spent some significant\ntime drilling down,\n\n00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.510\nreally taking it apart, understanding\nthe contributory frameworks and\n\n00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.160\nelements that help to\nmake up that vision of\n\n00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.770\nwhat cloud security looks like from an\noverarching perspective in the enterprise.\n\n00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.350\nVery important to think about that.\n\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.760\nWe talked a lot about the building\nblocks that go in there.\n\n00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.310\nWe talked about risk management.\n\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.666\nWe talked about the ITIL service vision\nof how we do availability management,\n\n00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:08.485\nrelease and deployment management, how\nwe bring confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n00:02:08.485 --> 00:02:11.467\navailability controls and\nprotections to the fore.\n\n00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:15.520\nAll these things were things that\nwere elements of that architecture.\n\n00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.690\nRemember, going out, taking a look at the\nCSA's website will be very valuable for\n\n00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.783\nyou and beneficial, as an aspiring CCSP.\n\n00:02:22.783 --> 00:02:26.165\nWe have continued that conversation with\nregards to things like virtualization and\n\n00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:27.595\nvirtualization security.\n\n00:02:27.595 --> 00:02:31.775\nI've mention in a couple of prior episodes\nhow important virtualization is and\n\n00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:34.145\nhas been as a key enabling technology, and\n\n00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:37.635\na platform to build the concepts\nof cloud computing on.\n\n00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:40.191\nWell we have to think about\nwhat virtualization does,\n\n00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:41.312\nwhat it allows us to do.\n\n00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:46.239\nI made it clear that when we think\nabout the ideas behind virtualization,\n\n00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.960\nthat we can virtualize\nwithout using the cloud.\n\n00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.420\nBut it's very difficult, if not I would\nsay impossible, at the enterprise level as\n\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.450\nwe scale up, to envision the cloud without\nvirtualization underlying it in some form.\n\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.710\nJust because of the definition and\n\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.100\nthe criteria we use to define the cloud\ntoday and how we envision and consume it.\n\n00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.310\nSo virtualization security, very,\nvery important for what we do.\n\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.250\nWhen we think about virtualization,\nDan for instance,\n\n00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.340\nI'm gonna ask you to help me out here for\na second.\n\n00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.870\nWhen we think about virtualization,\nwhat do you think of?\n\n00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.560\nWhen you and I chat about virtualization\nhypothetically as we're doing now,\n\n00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.440\nwhat comes to your mind?\n\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.100\nWhat do you think about?\n\n00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.390\n>> I tend to think of things like VMware\nand virtualizing server environments,\n\n00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.717\ncuz that's what I'm used to.\n\n00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:29.550\nWe actually was a part of\ncreating a private cloud.\n\n00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.970\n>> Okay, so univirtualization and\nVM work tend to go hand and hand.\n\n00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.360\nWe often think about that market leader\nfor many years in virtualization.\n\n00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.490\nNot certainly to leave out any of the\nother vendors, but any of those vendors,\n\n00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.240\nright, that are in virtualization space.\n\n00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.730\nWe've mentioned Citrix,\nmentioned Microsoft, as well.\n\n00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.465\nOracle does enterprise virtualization,\n\n00:03:45.465 --> 00:03:48.510\nalthough very small percentage of the\nmarket is attributed to their platform,\n\n00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.930\nbut we wannamake sure we're\naware of those other vendors.\n\n00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.630\nBut broadly and generically we do,\n\n00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.350\nwe think about the ability to create\nessentially private clouds which is where\n\n00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.160\nwe've aligned that thought process with\nmore often than not traditionally.\n\n00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.630\nWe have to understand that, underlying the\npublic cloud, underlying a hybrid cloud,\n\n00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.520\nunderlying the community cloud is\nthis idea of virtualization as well.\n\n00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.857\nIn other words, it's not just\nlimited to the private cloud.\n\n00:04:09.857 --> 00:04:13.933\nI wanna make sure you're clear on that\nin your mind as a CSSP potentially,\n\n00:04:13.933 --> 00:04:16.894\ncuz you have to understand\nthat virtualization is one\n\n00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:19.890\nof these key enables across\nall cloud platforms.\n\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.460\nIt's a great equalizer as we like to say,\nwith regards to cloud technology,\n\n00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.370\nbecause it allows for\nthat ultimate scalability,\n\n00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.300\nultimate consuming on demand,\nnetwork access always available.\n\n00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.300\nAll those things.\n\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.847\nIt's really what virtualization does,\nresource pooling.\n\n00:04:32.847 --> 00:04:35.507\nVirtualization's built\naround all these concepts.\n\n00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:37.910\nWe have to think about\nvirtualization security.\n\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.280\nIt's not just about making sure we can\nvirtualize, but that we can virtualize\n\n00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.760\nwith a sense of risk and\nmanaging risk down on the organization.\n\n00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.520\nAnd security awareness with regards\nto the platform is very important.\n\n00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.530\nSo what are some of the key\ntechnologies and concerns and\n\n00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.360\nrisks that we may think of with\nregards to virtualization?\n\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.100\nSo, any thoughts about some of the key\nvirtualization security concerns\n\n00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.660\nthat we may have?\n\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.130\nSo if I said to you, for instance,\nhypothetically, when I say you,\n\n00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.370\nI'm looking at Daniel.\n\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.557\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n00:05:03.557 --> 00:05:06.794\n>> But any of you out there and we'll\nhave a conversation all right, all of us.\n\n00:05:06.794 --> 00:05:09.762\nI'm going to have it with Daniel right\nnow just to kind of spur you guys to\n\n00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:10.460\nthink about it.\n\n00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.370\nSo when you think about virtualization,\nas you mentioned,\n\n00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.710\nyou may think of VM Ware and doing\na private cloud, right, hypothetically.\n\n00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.410\nSo what would be some of the security\nconcerns in your mind, right,\n\n00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.320\nhypothetically as an administrator, that\nyou may think of with regards to that?\n\n00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.200\n>> I would think of just as far as access\nbetween VMs, I wouldn't want one user or\n\n00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.930\nmalicious user maybe, jumping from\nan environment to where they're allowed,\n\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.380\nto an environment where\nthey're not allowed.\n\n00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.130\nI don't want them hopping through just\nbecause they have access to the same\n\n00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.120\nresources, that's probably\nmy biggest concern.\n\n00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.200\n>> So\nwe would think of certainly VM hopping,\n\n00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.750\nwhich is actually the name of one of\nthe attacks we would be worried about.\n\n00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.650\nWe think of the VMware hopping or\nthe VM escape,\n\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.440\na name for basically the same kind of\nattack in the virtualization space.\n\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:52.602\nWe'd wanna think of access control.\n\n00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:56.460\nWe'd wanna think of storage control,\nbecause we'd have to isolate storage,\n\n00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.490\nisolate access, isolate the instances\nin the multi-tenant environment so\n\n00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.260\nthat they're unable to see each other,\nso we'd think of things like zoning and\n\n00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.830\nmasking on the storage side.\n\n00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.755\nAnd we would think about host isolation.\n\n00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:10.445\nWe'd think about guest\nisolation on the host.\n\n00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:13.790\nWe'd think about that role of\nthe hypervisor in this whole process.\n\n00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.960\nThe hypervisor being\nthe abstraction layer,\n\n00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.852\nthe software based control element that\nessentially allows us to consume physical\n\n00:06:19.852 --> 00:06:23.632\nresources from the host to an abstracted\nlayer of some kind that makes them appear\n\n00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:27.607\nas if they're dedicated resources to the\nguest, to the virtual operating system.\n\n00:06:27.607 --> 00:06:31.494\nWhen in fact they're just time sliced\nelements of the host physical resource\n\n00:06:31.494 --> 00:06:34.302\nbeing replicated over and\nover and over and over again,\n\n00:06:34.302 --> 00:06:37.480\nbeing given out to the guest\ninstances on demand, right.\n\n00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.306\nSo we have different kinds of hypervisors.\n\n00:06:39.306 --> 00:06:42.840\nType-1 and or Type-2 hypervisors\nbecome important for us and\n\n00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.180\nwe have just to understand the benefits\nand the liabilities associated with these.\n\n00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.770\nA Type-1 hypervisor is\na hardware hypervisor.\n\n00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.210\nThis is essentially the hypervisor that\nis going to be built into a host, or\n\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.990\nbe coming from a host when\nwe are using hardware.\n\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.890\nThe operating system or Type-2 hypervisor,\nwhich is a application based hypervisor,\n\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.570\nruns on top as an application\nof the guest operating system or\n\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.590\nexcuse me, runs on top of\nthe operating system of the host,\n\n00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.360\nbelow the guest operating system but\nas a program.\n\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.460\nSo if you think of a virtual PC,\nif you think of Virtual Box,\n\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.390\nif you think of Parallels or Boot Camp or\nwhatever you may use on various platforms,\n\n00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.122\nthat's the Type-2 hypervisor, right?\n\n00:07:21.122 --> 00:07:24.170\nThe Type-1 hypervisor is\ngonna come directly from\n\n00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.990\nthe hardware of the operating\nsystem itself being interacting.\n\n00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.950\nSo ESXi is the host\noperating system in VMware.\n\n00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.500\nBeing installed and using the VM\nkernel as a hypervisor, for instance,\n\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.940\nright would be that kind of thing.\n\n00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.570\nSo wanna be thinking about those different\ntypes and understand what they are.\n\n00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.730\nVery important for\nus to differentiate between them.\n\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:44.272\nEach one has security associations and\nconcerns with it.\n\n00:07:44.272 --> 00:07:47.509\nA Type-2 hypervisor is gonna be\nan application based hypervisor,\n\n00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.310\nwe have to be thinking about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.678\nWe have to be concerned about\nthe fact that if the application has\n\n00:07:54.678 --> 00:07:57.980\na flaw in it of some kind, right?\n\n00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.466\nMicrosoft's Virtual PC Java's\nnow a Sun because Sun Java,\n\n00:08:01.466 --> 00:08:05.350\nnow Oracle rather I should say,\nowned by Oracle.\n\n00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.920\nThey bought up Sun and as a result own\nVirtual Box which was a Sun product.\n\n00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:14.680\nIf they put out a patch to that item,\nif VM or workstation gets put out and\n\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.135\nthere's an update to that and\nthat patch is not effective,\n\n00:08:17.135 --> 00:08:20.680\nany of those could potentially prove\nto be a problem and they could cause\n\n00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.910\ninstead of the isolation we expect from\nthat kind of hypervisor to be provided.\n\n00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.580\nThe abilities you mentioned for\nVMs maybe to see each other, and\n\n00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.300\nthat could be an issue if it's\nnot regulated properly, right.\n\n00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.490\nOr those VMs may be able to\nsuck resources in a denial or\n\n00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.980\ndistributed denial-of-service\nattack away from other legitimate\n\n00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.170\nguest operating systems for\nVMs that are running.\n\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.540\nThat could also lead to\na confrontation and a compromise.\n\n00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.500\nSo a lot of these things\ncould be problematic.\n\n00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.110\nWe may run that.\n\n00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:49.725\nI do for instance, I don't know if you do,\non your laptop but I run some sort of\n\n00:08:49.725 --> 00:08:54.134\na Hyper-Visor running on top of\nthe operating system as an application.\n\n00:08:54.134 --> 00:08:57.965\nIn Windows 8,\n8.1 I run client side Hyper-V so\n\n00:08:57.965 --> 00:09:04.200\nI essentially run the equivalent of\nthe inheritor virtual PC on that platform.\n\n00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.400\nI run it on my tablet,\n\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.500\non my older laptop here that I tend to\nuse when I'm spending time with you guys.\n\n00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.960\nRunning Windows 7,\nI run the equivalent of virtual PC there.\n\n00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.100\nI can run all sorts of stuff.\n\n00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.920\nWhen I run those kinds of Hyper-Visors,\nI have to be worried about\n\n00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.250\npatching the operating system as\nwell as patching the application.\n\n00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.680\nWhereas when I'm running the Hyper-Visor\nthat's embedded in the operating system,\n\n00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.660\nI have to really just worry\nabout the security managing and\n\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.860\npatch managing the operating system so\n\n00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:31.280\nthere's a little bit less that I have\nto be focused on and concerned with.\n\n00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.330\nWe have to be worried about\nthese things because, otherwise,\n\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.450\nVMs may actually bleed into each other and\ndistributed denial of service attacks\n\n00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.120\non virtualization platforms\nare not unheard of.\n\n00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.570\nI'm not saying they're very common but\nthey're not unheard of where we attack\n\n00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:48.170\nhosts and as a result suck resources away\nfrom individual running instances and\n\n00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.770\nthat can be a very big issue and a concern\nin a multi tenant hosting environment.\n\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:56.240\n>> Adam, would you say that running a type\ntwo Hyper-Visor, it seems to be anyway,\n\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.860\nlet me put it this way, it seems to\nbe the more insecure platform because\n\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.540\nyou have the guest operating system,\nwhich you have to keep patched.\n\n00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.565\nThen you have the application\nof the Hyper-Visor itself,\n\n00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:07.700\nwhich you have to keep patched.\n\n00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.590\nAnd then if you're running virtual\nmachines they are machines.\n\n00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.530\nThey are having access to resources,\nso you have to patch them as well,\n\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.150\nwhereas in the type 1,\nyou're just passing the Hyper-Visor and\n\n00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.420\nthen any machines that you're\nbuilding on top of it.\n\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.200\n>> So, interesting question,\nbecause there is this kind of debate right\n\n00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.900\nabout which one would be more insecure or\nmore secure, flip it around the other way.\n\n00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.902\nAnd the first inclination is simply\nto go the way you just described,\n\n00:10:27.902 --> 00:10:31.475\nwhich is well multiple layers of patching\nthat has to happen, administration and\n\n00:10:31.475 --> 00:10:34.685\noversight, likelihood that we're not\ngoing to get all of them correct or\n\n00:10:34.685 --> 00:10:37.534\nthat there may be some interplay\nthere we're not anticipating,\n\n00:10:37.534 --> 00:10:40.789\nthere could be an issue so it's more\nlikely that there would be a problem.\n\n00:10:40.789 --> 00:10:43.891\nAnd most people will essentially go\nthat way, and I'm not suggesting for\n\n00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:46.903\na minute that I don't necessarily\nagree right with what we just heard.\n\n00:10:46.903 --> 00:10:51.390\nBut let me offer you the counter argument\nwhich is a type 1 Hyper-Visor essentially\n\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.778\nright so a hardware embedded Hyper-Visor\nin the operating system itself.\n\n00:10:54.778 --> 00:10:59.130\nAnd so we talked about, as you said,\nessentially just having a patch manage\n\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.279\nthe Hyper-Visor which is really\npatch managing the Hyper-Visor's OS\n\n00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:07.237\nthat surrounds it, whatever that is and\nVM or CSS, ESXI these days.\n\n00:11:07.237 --> 00:11:11.752\nIn Microsoft operating it would be the\noperating system that provides the Hyper-V\n\n00:11:11.752 --> 00:11:16.652\ncapability, whatever that would be,\nServer 2008, AR2, 1212 R2 etc., and\n\n00:11:16.652 --> 00:11:20.521\nthen, as a result, if that's done\ncorrectly in theory, how do we then\n\n00:11:20.521 --> 00:11:24.280\ndeal with the guest operating systems,\nwhich we commonly call VMs.\n\n00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.420\nJust in the formal language refer to\nthem often as guest operating systems,\n\n00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.570\nbut you generically call\nthem Virtual Machines.\n\n00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.720\nWe have to deal with the VMs right.\n\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.450\nSo is that more or less secure?\n\n00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.900\nSo hypothetically, what happens if\nthe vendor puts out the patch for\n\n00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.840\nthe, either operating system and\nor Hyper-Visor or both.\n\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.130\nAnd that patch gets applied incorrectly.\n\n00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.320\nWe're at the same place\nas with a type two,\n\n00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.120\nwe're essentially we're one\nlevel removed from patching.\n\n00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.530\nIn order to patch three things,\n\n00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.240\nwe have to patch two things\ncuz one of them is combined.\n\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.620\nBut essentially we're in the same place.\n\n00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.163\nI don't necessarily see it as a question\nof which one is more or less secure.\n\n00:11:58.163 --> 00:12:03.209\nI see it more as a question of which one\nare we better equipped as an organization\n\n00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:07.719\nto manage from a policy and a process\nperspective right because from my\n\n00:12:07.719 --> 00:12:12.766\nperspective as security professional,\nas a risk manager, as cloud security\n\n00:12:12.766 --> 00:12:18.194\nprofessional, as a CISSP for instance, as\na CISA an information system auditor and\n\n00:12:18.194 --> 00:12:22.727\nthousand other things that I am over\nmy three decade long career in IT.\n\n00:12:22.727 --> 00:12:27.251\nI've come to understand and I've come to\nknow that regardless of how easy or hard\n\n00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:31.658\na vendor makes it for me to do something,\nI've got to rise above that, right?\n\n00:12:31.658 --> 00:12:35.479\nAnd ultimately as a security professional\nI've got to figure out what I'm going\n\n00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:36.152\nto do right and\n\n00:12:36.152 --> 00:12:40.210\nwhat I'm not willing to do in order\nto make sure I don't do things wrong.\n\n00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.700\nAnd from my perspective,\nand again this is just me.\n\n00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.530\nLike you just offer your opinion and\n\n00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.270\nI started off by saying that\nI agree with what you said.\n\n00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:49.250\nBut I have a different interpretation.\n\n00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:53.900\nMy interpretation is, I think each\ncan be equally secure or insecure.\n\n00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.140\nDepending on the person\npulling the levers and\n\n00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:58.560\nin this case pushing\nthe buttons to apply patches.\n\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.590\nBecause what I often find is regardless\nof where the Hyper-Visor lives.\n\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.200\nMost security professionals and\nI'm going to just be brutally honest with\n\n00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.650\nall of you out there and\nwith us here in the studio\n\n00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.362\ntend to be not as focused on certain\naspects of management as they could be.\n\n00:13:13.362 --> 00:13:15.660\nAnd I'll give you a real\nworld practical example.\n\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.830\nMost people are pretty good at doing\npatch management of operating systems.\n\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.490\nThey're not so good at doing firmware\nbased patch management of systems.\n\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:25.980\nAnd so if we don't patch manage the\nfirmware, although certainly nowhere near\n\n00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.810\nas often right to be fair, as patches\ncome out on the operating systems.\n\n00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.390\nBut if we don't patch manage\nthe firmware of these hosts\n\n00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:34.820\nthe Hyper-Visor security may\nbe the least of our problems.\n\n00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.830\nSomebody may come along,\ntake that host right out from under us\n\n00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:41.800\nbecause we've opened up a liability\nlike ShellShock, or who knows what other\n\n00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.980\nvulnerabilities are there because\nfirmware has not been patched.\n\n00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.300\nAnd so\nI see this all the time in the real world.\n\n00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:51.500\nSo I'd really like to change the dynamic\nand the tenor of the conversation and\n\n00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.330\nI want to talk about risk, but\nI want to talk about risk all up.\n\n00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.200\nI'd rather not say, hey, this is\nreally insecure, this is more secure.\n\n00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.400\nAnd if you just do this, you're all right.\n\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.380\nBecause then what happens is you create\na false sense of security, right?\n\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.460\nPeople say, well, Adam or Daniel said\nit was better to do it this way, right?\n\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.570\nSo as a result of that if I just do that,\nI'm gonna be fine.\n\n00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.230\nWell, no, if you do that you may or may\nnot be fine because if you're not gonna be\n\n00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.700\nvigilant, if you're not gonna\nbe hyper-focused on the thread,\n\n00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.560\nif you're not gonna constantly be\nmaking sure it's done the right way.\n\n00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.730\nYou're no more secure than\nif you do the other thing.\n\n00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.450\nYou're no less secure, by the way, either.\n\n00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:24.800\nYou're no more secure.\n\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.990\n>> Adam, it sounds like you're saying that\nsecurity really boils down to the lowest\n\n00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.540\ncommon denominator, and\nthat typically tends to be us.\n\n00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.620\n>> It boils down to and\nI think it's fair to say,\n\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.220\nit boils down to the lowest\ncommon denominator.\n\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:36.000\nIt doesn't tend to be us per se.\n\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.840\nI agree with you but let's shape that and\ntailor that statement a little bit more.\n\n00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.790\nIt boils down to the least common\ndenominator which tends to be the path of\n\n00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.453\nleast resistance right and unfortunately,\nI get your point, I take your point, and\n\n00:14:48.453 --> 00:14:49.600\nit's well made.\n\n00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.680\nYes, it tends to be us,\nus being generically,\n\n00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.500\nthe most insecure of the people,\nor most insecure of the policies,\n\n00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.860\nor least applied of the policies\nin the organization.\n\n00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.840\nI just prefer to frame it with regards\nto least common denominator being\n\n00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.930\npath of least resistance because\nwe know given three choices,\n\n00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:08.470\nthe three bear analogy, right?\n\n00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.200\nToo hard, too soft, just right.\n\n00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.230\nWe're gonna go with\nthe easiest of those three.\n\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.670\nWe're not gonna do the hard,\nright, because it's too hard.\n\n00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.809\nWe're just not gonna do it,\nat least not do it consistently.\n\n00:15:17.809 --> 00:15:20.517\nProblem is it probably is the thing\nwe need to do to be secure and\n\n00:15:20.517 --> 00:15:22.602\nbecause it's not gonna\nbe done consistently,\n\n00:15:22.602 --> 00:15:26.410\nwe're actually managing risk up in\nthe organization by allowing more to occur\n\n00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.101\nthan we should as opposed\nto managing it down.\n\n00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:30.720\nWhich means in theory we're mitigating and\n\n00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.100\nminimizing it through consistent\napplication of process.\n\n00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.210\nProcedure driven by policy,\nbusiness aligned, risk managed and\n\n00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.830\nrisk aligned with risk catalog.\n\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.491\nThat's not happening consistently so\nin effect, it's not happening at all.\n\n00:15:42.491 --> 00:15:46.631\nAnd that becomes a major liability for us\nso, it is really, I think, a question on\n\n00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:50.421\nthat which one is more secure but rather,\nhow good are we in managing risk?\n\n00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:53.710\nBecause I can make either\nHyper-Visor equally secure.\n\n00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.498\nIf I consistently apply policy,\nprocess and procedure.\n\n00:15:56.498 --> 00:15:59.470\nI continuously monitor,\nI randomly sample and\n\n00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:04.670\nI risk manage the use of that hypervisor\nby properly documenting the concerns.\n\n00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.560\nAnd having mitigating,\ncompensating, and detective and\n\n00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.230\npreventive controls\nthat overlap each other\n\n00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.910\nin a security architecture that we\ncommonly refer to as Defense in Depth.\n\n00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:15.720\nAnd if I do that properly,\n\n00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.670\nI should be able to make either\none of those relatively risk free.\n\n00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.700\nNot 100% risk free, we know while it's a\nnice thing to say and hang on the wall and\n\n00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.220\nsay, our aspiration right,\nis to get to a zero-risk solution.\n\n00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.200\nWe should know and be brutally honest\nwith ourselves as security professionals,\n\n00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.380\nthat there's no such thing\nas a zero-risk solution.\n\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.400\nThere's always risk, we may not realize,\n\n00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.620\nwe may not identify, we may not know what\nthat risk is at the moment we measure it.\n\n00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.370\nSo it's undefined in the system but\nit's there, and\n\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:43.790\nwe call that residual risk, right?\n\n00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.380\nRisk that is left over that is either\nundefined, unknown or untreated, or\n\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.220\nsome combination of those, it's there.\n\n00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.350\nAnd as a result, we never get to a zero\nresolution but we can mitigate and\n\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:56.760\nessentially manage risk down.\n\n00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.840\nSo I think that's the way,\nat least how I would frame it,\n\n00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.115\nhow I would try to go\nwith that conversation.\n\n00:17:03.115 --> 00:17:05.860\nCuz I get asked that all the time,\nwell which one's more or less secure?\n\n00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.670\nWell clearly we spend a lot\nmore time on the enterprise\n\n00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.930\nusing embedded hypervisors, right?\n\n00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.560\nType 1 hypervisors where\nwe're essentially using\n\n00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.890\nthe guest operating system to run\non top of something like ESXi.\n\n00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.847\nAnd have ESXi as an operating\nsystem provide the VMkernel.\n\n00:17:20.847 --> 00:17:24.581\nThat's the enterprise approach, that's\nwhat we do, good, bad, right, or wrong,\n\n00:17:24.581 --> 00:17:26.860\nrisk-adverse, risk-aware, notwithstanding.\n\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:29.912\nIt's what the majority of\nenterprise risk or excuse me,\n\n00:17:29.912 --> 00:17:34.540\nthe majority of enterprise virtualization\nmanagement is being done with today.\n\n00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.700\nThat doesn't mean it's more secure,\n\n00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.990\nit just means that's the model\nwe chose to go with.\n\n00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:42.290\nI've seen plenty of implementations\nthat are highly secure in that world.\n\n00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.890\nI've seen plenty that\nare like swiss cheese\n\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.620\njust because people don't follow\nthe right process and right procedure.\n\n00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.340\nSo it really just it comes\ndown to as you said, us.\n\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.890\nI'd just like to define us,\n\n00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.660\nbecause then it becomes a conversation\nof us versus them if we don’t define it.\n\n00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.720\nAnd I don’t want it to be in my costumers'\neyes about me laying blame at their feet\n\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.460\nand telling them that they’re\nnot doing something right.\n\n00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:05.570\nYou are a consultant and\nessentially a mentor to the organization,\n\n00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.780\noffering guidance.\n\n00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.740\nI want the role of security professional\nto be seen as value positive.\n\n00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.700\nAnd to be always seen as adding the right\n\n00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.400\nthought process to the organization\nat the critical moment.\n\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.590\nTo enable success as opposed to\nbeing confrontational, right?\n\n00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:20.990\nAnd say, hey you're not doing it this way,\n\n00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.620\nand this is why you're having a problem,\nwe may need to take that approach.\n\n00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.710\nBut it has to be done within the context\nof how we're gonna make it better,\n\n00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.225\nnot in the context of laying blame.\n\n00:18:30.225 --> 00:18:33.320\nBecause then unfortunately, it becomes\nsomething that's adversarial and\n\n00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:34.530\nwe may not always see value in that.\n\n00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.380\nIt's true, a lot of the times,\nif we're not diplomatic about things,\n\n00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.390\nit becomes an us versus\nthem kind of mentality.\n\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.560\nAnd then you start butting heads and\n\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.160\nnothing ever gets done because\nthey're like, not gonna listen to you.\n\n00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.460\nBecause you're basically\nmy enemy at this point and\n\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.360\nI don't wanna hear what you have to say.\n\n00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.110\nI do like your approach to that to say,\nwell let's come at this together, let's\n\n00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.900\nfind out where the problems are gonna lie,\nlet's see what we can do better.\n\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.170\nAnd that helps keep security high.\n\n00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.840\nAnd yeah it's very important,\nat the end of the day,\n\n00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.460\nthe old adage right, you catch more flies\nwith honey than you do with vinegar.\n\n00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.190\nOr as Sheldon on The Big Bang says,\nyou catch even more with manure,\n\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:08.670\nwhat's your point,\nif you saw that episode.\n\n00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:13.280\nBut the point is that it's important\nto understand that this is, and\n\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.430\nsecurity generically\nwhether it's cloud-based or\n\n00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.430\nnot, and risk management generically\nwhether it's cloud-based or not.\n\n00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.560\nYou have this conversation with the CISSP,\nwith an SSCP,\n\n00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.530\nwith a CCSP, ABC, do re mi,\nyou and me, whatever it is, right?\n\n00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:29.920\nThe point is we add security\ninto the mix in any area,\n\n00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.650\nwe have to understand\nthat it's a partnership.\n\n00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:34.720\nAnd if we as security\nprofessionals are adversarial and\n\n00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.300\nconfrontational in the organization, we're\ngonna be marginalized and sidetracked.\n\n00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.330\nEssentially to the point that\nnobody's gonna take our guidance and\n\n00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.830\nit's like the Chicken Little syndrome,\nright?\n\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.810\nThe sky is falling, the sky is falling,\nthe sky is falling.\n\n00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:47.850\nWhen it finally does fall,\nnobody's gonna listen.\n\n00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.100\nAnd then at that point, they're gonna lay\nthe blame at your feet and say, well,\n\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.250\nyou should have been there,\nyou should have told us.\n\n00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:55.440\nAnd that gets into a pissing contest\nabout who was right, who was wrong,\n\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.750\nthere's no value in that at all.\n\n00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.460\nI mean, I've been down that road early in\nmy career, I burned myself out, right?\n\n00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.160\nEarly on my hair was a lot thicker,\n\n00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.290\nit was a lot darker,\nI didn't have any of this gray, right?\n\n00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.950\nWhen I started out, and I would butt\nheads with people all the time and\n\n00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:11.740\nsay what has to be this\nway because I'm right.\n\n00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.500\nThat was a week ago, right?\n\n00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.315\nThat was yesterday, actually.\n\n00:20:14.315 --> 00:20:16.810\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Right when I was all,\n\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:18.210\nbefore I went gray.\n\n00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.456\nI was dark haired and I was [CROSSTALK].\n\n00:20:20.456 --> 00:20:25.430\nLook at what IT Pro TV has done to me,\nit sucked the life out of me as we say.\n\n00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:29.560\nBut all kidding aside, right,\nthink about the logic of this.\n\n00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.840\nI've seen it and freely admit it's\nhappened to me in my career early on.\n\n00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.500\nIf you talk to most IT professionals\nthat have done this long enough,\n\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.290\nthey'll tell you similar stories.\n\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.410\nYou may be in that same boat,\n\n00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.820\nby the way, where you're having those\nconversations at work in the real world.\n\n00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.740\nIt is important to understand that if\nyou can't partner, you can't create\n\n00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:46.530\na secure environment and manage risk\neffectively in the organization.\n\n00:20:46.530 --> 00:20:49.310\nIt's that simple, regardless of\nwhether cloud's involved or not.\n\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:51.280\nCloud makes it more complicated,\nit makes it more exciting,\n\n00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.860\nbut it makes it more complicated.\n\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.460\n>> You gotta partner even more,\nbecause you got more people involved.\n\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.940\nAnd therefore, as a result, you've\ngot more things you've got to manage.\n\n00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:59.340\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:04.420\nif you're not really gonna reach out\nthe proverbial hand and partner.\n\n00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.510\nYou're gonna be on an island by yourself\nlooking at the sharks circling you,\n\n00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.820\nwondering how you're gonna survive.\n\n00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.240\nAnd that's not a good place\nto find yourself, by the way.\n\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.790\nSo security considerations for\nall the different categories, right?\n\n00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.790\nWe have to think about virtualization,\nbut also overall.\n\n00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.728\nWith regards to IAS,\nwe talked about some of these all ready,\n\n00:21:19.728 --> 00:21:21.580\nvirtual machine attacks, as we said.\n\n00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.210\nVirtual networking infrastructure,\nthe hypervisor,\n\n00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.195\nwe've just talked about some of those and\nthose concerns.\n\n00:21:26.195 --> 00:21:29.360\nVM-based rootkits,\nthese are nasty, nasty things,\n\n00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.270\nyou think about rootkits overall in\nthe physical world and what they can do.\n\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:33.740\nAnd there's been many examples of this,\n\n00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.500\nthe Sony PlayStation hack a couple years\nago, there was a rootkit involved in that.\n\n00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.640\nThere have been several rootkits that\nhave been involved in major breaches\n\n00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.650\nin recent years.\n\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.200\nSo take that into the virtual world,\n\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.460\nspread it across the cloud,\nworks the same way.\n\n00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.000\nOne of the things I talk to my\nstudents about all the time, and\n\n00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.490\nI talk to customers about all the time.\n\n00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:54.740\nWhen I teach virtualization classes for\nVMware, for instance, or Microsoft or\n\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.850\nany of the vendors I work with and\nI'm certified to teach for.\n\n00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.600\nOr I just do consulting, and\n\n00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.970\nI talk to customers about\nthe needs they have in this space.\n\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.970\nEverything you know about\nthe physical world,\n\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.840\nwithout exception, everything you know\nworks the same way in the virtual world.\n\n00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.930\nSo, a layer 2 switch is a layer 2 switch,\n\n00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:11.770\nit's just virtualized,\nit works the same way.\n\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.970\nWe still have to worry about Mac\naddresses, we still have IP addresses.\n\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.410\nWe still have to bind the physical host\nadapter through an uplink to the switch.\n\n00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:22.950\nWe still have to bind the physical\nadapters so that the virtual machine can\n\n00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:26.650\nconnect to it and get out of the machine\non the host and connect, right?\n\n00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.650\nThose things don't change,\nnetworks are networks paths are paths,\n\n00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:30.730\nwe have to manage them.\n\n00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.190\nSo the idea of rootkits being\ninvolved in virtual machines\n\n00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.470\nshock some people sometimes, they say,\nwell, how could we possibly have those?\n\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.400\nWell, how could you not?\n\n00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.530\nThey exist in the real world,\n\n00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.180\nhow could you possibly think they\nwon't exist in the virtual world?\n\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.110\nAnd as a result in\nthe cloud-based world and\n\n00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.650\npeople have to get this\nthrough their heads.\n\n00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.310\nAnd, you, as potential CSP candidates,\n\n00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.460\nneed to wrap your head around this and\nunderstand.\n\n00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.410\nEverything we do in the non-cloud world\n\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:55.100\ncould potentially be\nimportant to the cloud world.\n\n00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.290\nWhich means all the value,\nall the great things we do, as well as,\n\n00:22:58.290 --> 00:22:59.300\nall the liability.\n\n00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.110\nAnd all the things that are just\nhorrendous to deal with from a management\n\n00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.240\nand security perspective, all the risk.\n\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.200\nIt all comes over, good,\nbad and different, right?\n\n00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.800\nOr good, bad and ugly, as they say.\n\n00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.690\nAs a result of that,\nwe get everything, and\n\n00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.310\nwhen we get everything,\nwe've gotta be prepared to manage.\n\n00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.890\nAnd as a result, you've gotta be prepared\nas a CCSP to take these issues and\n\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:16.503\nconcerns on.\n\n00:23:16.503 --> 00:23:18.105\nWe can attach the V-switches,\n\n00:23:18.105 --> 00:23:22.140\nthe virtual switches, we could attack\nthe physical entities through co-location.\n\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.680\nI may go in and rent the cage somewhere\nin the data center near yours and\n\n00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.930\nhave physical access\nrights to the data center.\n\n00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:33.620\nTo go in under the guise of hosting,\nto then propagate a physical access attack\n\n00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:36.750\ninside the data center against\nyour caged infrastructure.\n\n00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.930\nIf that data center provider is\nnot up on their physical security,\n\n00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.180\nif they're not monitoring, then chances\nare good I may be able to do that.\n\n00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.990\nClimbing an eight foot fence to get into\nyour cage is no big deal if nobody's\n\n00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.995\nwatching, all right?\n\n00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:49.295\nFor you it's nothing, it's like\nyou reach your hand up and you're.\n\n00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:50.850\nI just step over.\n\n00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:51.575\nYou just step right over the cage.\n\n00:23:51.575 --> 00:23:52.384\nFling my leg.\nI'm there for\n\n00:23:52.384 --> 00:23:54.976\nan hour scrambling up the links\ntrying to get up there, right?\n\n00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:58.944\nBut, think about this, this is not that\nhard, how hard is it to get over a cage?\n\n00:23:58.944 --> 00:24:02.893\nHow hard is it to walk through a cage door\nthat is improperly secured because it\n\n00:24:02.893 --> 00:24:06.845\ndoesn't have an auto locking mechanism\ninstead of relying on the customer to\n\n00:24:06.845 --> 00:24:08.340\nactually lock the cage?\n\n00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.600\nThese things if they're done the right\nway should have mag locks that\n\n00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.940\nautomatically lock anytime\nsomebody comes in and goes.\n\n00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.639\nI talk to my customers\nabout this all the time.\n\n00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.120\nWhat about not only the cage,\nbut what about the racks?\n\n00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.470\nA lot of times we have racks,\nor more often than not,\n\n00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:24.870\nyou'll have racks inside of the cage,\nrack after rack,\n\n00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:28.240\nrow after row of pizza boxes,\nas we call them in the industry.\n\n00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.170\nRight, one, or two, or four, or eight use\nservers that essentially are stacked up.\n\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.350\nAnd you'll put them in these\ncages inside these racks.\n\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.570\nMost people don't bother locking\nthe rack because it's a pain and\n\n00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.990\nit's just a time delaying\ndevice to get in.\n\n00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:45.350\nBut in secure hosting environments,\nthe cage is locked, the rack is locked and\n\n00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:49.460\neach rack has to be card swiped as\nwell as each cage entry to open up or\n\n00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.810\nyou have a key or whatever it is or\na biometric device.\n\n00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.130\nThere's different ways to do it.\n\n00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.890\nBut you've gotta swipe in or\n\n00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:59.520\nopen up several different access control\nboundaries to gain access to the wiring\n\n00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.380\npanels on the front end of those boxes\nin a highly secure infrastructure.\n\n00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:04.900\nAnd that's the way it should be,\nby the way.\n\n00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:08.140\nMost systems I walk into,\ncage is left open.\n\n00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.400\nRack doors, if they're even on, cuz a lot\nof times they'll just take them off\n\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.470\ncuz they get in the way,\nthey're not locked.\n\n00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.320\nAnd there may or\nmay not be cable management.\n\n00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.480\nWe may not be able to see\nwhat's going on in there.\n\n00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.180\nSo the reality is, these can be issues.\n\n00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.560\nI can easily rent space in my data\ncenter if I find out where your hosting.\n\n00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.270\nThat's not hard to do.\n\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.800\nAnd through social engineering,\n\n00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.720\nthat may not be real hard to do at all,\nquite honestly.\n\n00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.910\nAll I have to do is attack your physical\ninfrastructure, meaning your building,\n\n00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.810\nwhere you are actually located, figure out\nhow to get a job on that cleaning crew.\n\n00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.730\nGet in there in there in night and start\ngoing through people's offices looking for\n\n00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.600\nhosting contracts.\n\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.770\nIt won't be too hard to\nfigure out where you host,\n\n00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:44.310\neven if they're locked\nup in a file cabinet.\n\n00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.460\nHow hard is it to wait until\nsomebody throws something away,\n\n00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.800\nand all I do is pull it out of the trash.\n\n00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.850\nFins are not very hard at all.\n\n00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.870\nI can probably find that information in\nthe IT offices, because, it's probably up\n\n00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:58.490\non one of your plots up on the wall,\nit'll probably tell me, what your network\n\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.670\ntopology is, probably tell what your\nendpoint is, what your collocation is.\n\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.800\nAll I gotta do is go in and\nlook when you're not there.\n\n00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.100\nAnd to clean an office for a couple of\nnights to get inside and take pictures,\n\n00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.870\nwhen nobody is looking\nI'll do that all day.\n\n00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:13.430\nWhen I do pin testing, that's the kind\nof stuff we do to break into systems and\n\n00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.600\nfigure out how to socially\nengineer our way in.\n\n00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.500\nIt's not hard to do at all, and\nit's done all the time in the cloud.\n\n00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:21.860\nIt's just that you may not think about it\nbecause again, it's the physical world and\n\n00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:23.730\nthe physical world does\nnot exist in the cloud.\n\n00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:24.760\nWell, sure it does.\n\n00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.590\nIt exists the same exact way, but\nwe gotta think about that right?\n\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.590\nCloud virtual infrastructure threats,\nmulti-tenancy.\n\n00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.530\nWe gotta be worried about and concerned\nabout the idea there's a thousand other\n\n00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.560\npeople sharing that same conduit for\nservices I am.\n\n00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.190\nIf the service provider is not spot on\nwith isolation, zoning and masking,\n\n00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.750\nthe things they gotta do,\nwe're gonna have a problem.\n\n00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.370\nI'm gonna have a problem and\nmy data's gonna be exposed.\n\n00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:51.700\nWorkload complexity, loss of control,\nlogical network segmentation.\n\n00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:53.380\nLack of understanding\nof physical endpoints.\n\n00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.610\nSingle point of entry.\n\n00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:57.370\nAn egress, an access to infrastructure.\n\n00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.160\nAny or all these things are threats\nthat we have to worry about in the cloud\n\n00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.660\nwith virtualized infrastructure.\n\n00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.990\nThis is a big deal.\n\n00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.840\nThe platform is the service\nissues that we talk about often.\n\n00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.420\nSystem or resource isolation,\nagain, the same idea.\n\n00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.590\nHow do we logically and\nphysically isolate our environments.\n\n00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:15.340\nHow do we provision user access to\nthe app dev environment so we can isolate\n\n00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.200\ninstances running, virtualized instances\nrunning within the host right?\n\n00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.750\nSo this is also important, how do we\ndeal with malware back doors trojans.\n\n00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:25.650\nRemember the vendor is providing\nthe infrastructure and\n\n00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:27.340\nthe operating system and paths.\n\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.650\nThey are responsible for the OS\nthey're responsible for security and\n\n00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.620\npatch management.\n\n00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.140\nIf they're not doing their job I could\nbe as tight as I want to be on my\n\n00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.960\naccess control in the front end,\nif they allow malware onto the platform\n\n00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:41.600\nI may have no control over\nhow to deal with that.\n\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.170\nAs a matter of fact, that risk is\na risk that we have to identify in pass\n\n00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.820\nenvironment and document and\nmake sure we are willing to accept,\n\n00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.970\nas a way of doing business,\nbecause if the vendor drops the ball,\n\n00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.480\nI'm gonna be on the receiving end\nof that whether I wanna be or not.\n\n00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.540\nAnd I have no control over that at all,\nin a past environment.\n\n00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:58.890\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:03.390\nDenial or distributed denial of service\ncan happen VM to VM against a host.\n\n00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.480\nAnd those VMs can be used to\nsuck resources out of a host.\n\n00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.100\nOr in a clustered environment,\n\n00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.620\na collection of hosts that are running\njointly to provide pooled infrastructure.\n\n00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.890\nWe could suck the life out of\nan entire cluster by one VM or\n\n00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:20.380\ngroup of VM's being taken over\nessentially zombie or botified right and\n\n00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:23.190\nthen being used to execute denial or\ndistribute denial at the source\n\n00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.320\nattacks internally against the rest\nof that infrastructure pool.\n\n00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.790\nThis can happen I'm not\nsuggesting it does.\n\n00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.330\nBut I'm not suggesting it doesn't.\n\n00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.580\nIt's very clear that it could and\nin certain cases it has.\n\n00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.300\nAnd we have to understand that.\n\n00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.810\nPast tenants should not have\nshell access to the servers\n\n00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:40.600\nthat they are running their instances on,\neven when virtualized.\n\n00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.530\nBecause, if we're given that then we\nmay be able to control that host.\n\n00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:47.960\nAnd that host may be used to control\nmultiple tenants simultaneously.\n\n00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.330\nAnd that's something to consider.\n\n00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:53.430\nRemember, the cloud provider controls\nthe host and the infrastructure\n\n00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.210\nas well as the operational\nenvironment on the host and pass.\n\n00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:57.780\nWe simply run on top of it.\n\n00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.100\nWhen I run past infrastructure, I may or\nmay not have dedicated hosting.\n\n00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.820\nI can have that option, but I have to\ncontractually stipulate I want that and\n\n00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.880\nI may not always have that.\n\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.390\n>> So, Adam,\nthis really comes down to the fact of\n\n00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:11.610\nwhat am I willing to risk\nby going to the cloud?\n\n00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:15.400\nAnd then if I'm not willing to take those\nrisks then I need to keep it internal,\n\n00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.720\nI need to keep it in a private cloud.\n\n00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.620\n>> Yes, I think that's fair to say,\nright, we should be aware of the fact,\n\n00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.150\nwell with the following stipulation,\nright, we talk about private cloud.\n\n00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.190\nWe wanna make sure we talk about private\ncloud on prem that we control exclusively\n\n00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.860\nversus private cloud that may\nbe outsourced to a provider.\n\n00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.510\nSo, yes, with the caveat that not all\nprivate clouds are equal because not all\n\n00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.140\nprivate clouds are uniquely tailored\nto the needs of our environment and\n\n00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.940\nuniquely controlled by us.\n\n00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.620\nBut assuming it's a private cloud on prem\nwith that caveat, absolutely, 100% agree.\n\n00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.330\nHowever if it's a private cloud\nthat we outsource centrally,\n\n00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.710\nright to a third party provider,\nwe're in the same boat.\n\n00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.220\nWe're back to where we were, which is you\nknow we want to have that control but\n\n00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:59.370\nwe don't really because the cloud provider\ncentrally is providing those elements and\n\n00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.360\nwe may not have total understanding nor\nvisibility.\n\n00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:06.990\nInto critical elements, like, logging,\naccess control to the physical plane\n\n00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.780\nas supposed or to the data plane or\nthe management plane.\n\n00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.700\nThese our concerns in the cloud\nthat we really have to think about.\n\n00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.300\nWe have to be aware of.\n\n00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.130\nSo, you make a valid point.\n\n00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.900\nWe just really want to carve out and\nclarify that distinction.\n\n00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.760\nOf private cloud being played on\nboth sides of the divide there.\n\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.400\nIt's got to be on prem private cloud.\n\n00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.110\nThat's really where we gain that\nadvantage of total management up and\n\n00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:27.140\ndown the layers or across all the layers.\n\n00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:31.950\nWith regards to SaaS, things like data\nsegregation, data access policies\n\n00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.495\nWeb application security,\nthese are important security caveats and\n\n00:30:34.495 --> 00:30:36.565\nelements that we have\nto think about as well.\n\n00:30:36.565 --> 00:30:40.465\nWe've talked about the fact that multiple\nusers will store multiple tenants\n\n00:30:40.465 --> 00:30:44.557\nwill store their data in application\nhosted models using SaaS.\n\n00:30:44.557 --> 00:30:48.570\nAgain, once that coming back end storage\nlook like, how are we mingling or\n\n00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.337\nnot mingling our data?\n\n00:30:49.337 --> 00:30:50.177\nHow are we mingling or\n\n00:30:50.177 --> 00:30:54.867\nnot mingling our multiple storage paths\nand access control mechanisms across them\n\n00:30:54.867 --> 00:30:59.317\nto ensure that only the LUNs that belong\nto me are being shown to me as a customer.\n\n00:30:59.317 --> 00:31:02.907\nI should not be able to see or\nmount another tenant's LUNs.\n\n00:31:02.907 --> 00:31:05.358\nA LUN is the logical unit\nnumber the essential,\n\n00:31:05.358 --> 00:31:09.250\nvirtual representation of\nphysical storage on the platform.\n\n00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:14.420\nSo we take a storage array, huge bunch\nof discs in a SAN where we may have x\n\n00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.180\nbytes of storage running in cabinets,\njust row after row of storage\n\n00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.510\nthat's essentially containerized,\njust running in these large boxes.\n\n00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:24.420\nYou've got thousands of spinning discs.\n\n00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.370\nI'm gonna virtually represent\na section of that, carve it off, and\n\n00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:29.370\nI'm gonna hand it to Daniel and\nsay, hey, here you go.\n\n00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.740\nHere's your storage.\n\n00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.808\nThat is a LUN one or more of them\nthat we use to represent storage.\n\n00:31:33.808 --> 00:31:37.450\nIn a SaaS model, I have to figure\nout as the storage vendor,\n\n00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:41.900\nessentially the cloud provider, right, I\nhave to figure out how to do that without\n\n00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:46.550\nexposing his LUNs to me and without\nexposing my data and my LUNs to him.\n\n00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:48.783\nBecause if I can't zone and\nmask appropriately,\n\n00:31:48.783 --> 00:31:50.918\nI have no way of controlling\nthat environment.\n\n00:31:50.918 --> 00:31:56.698\n>> If I send you out a storage path that\ncrosses my LUNs, you're gonna see my data.\n\n00:31:56.698 --> 00:32:00.768\nAnd I may have 100 storage paths for 100\ndifferent customers I have to manage, and\n\n00:32:00.768 --> 00:32:04.343\nif it's multi path there may be 3 or\n4 instances that each of those customers\n\n00:32:04.343 --> 00:32:07.973\npotentially can use to access storage\non the backend because the redundancy,\n\n00:32:07.973 --> 00:32:10.660\nhigh availability and\nthings of that nature.\n\n00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.120\nSo I have a really big,\nvery, very tough and\n\n00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.350\nvery difficult job as an infrastructure\nmanager, as an architect on the Cloud for\n\n00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:20.600\nstorage, if I'm working for\nin one of these environments.\n\n00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.220\nWhereas the customer, I just show up and\nsay here's my money, I want my data.\n\n00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.680\nAs a SAS provider I've\ngot a lot of problems.\n\n00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:31.700\nAs a SAS customer all I gotta\ndo is to simply consume.\n\n00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.930\nSo it's really about transference of risk,\n\n00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:35.630\nand where that risks resides\nultimately we have to worry about.\n\n00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:40.550\nSo data access policies,\nstrict implementation of access control,\n\n00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:45.100\nvalidation, continuous monitoring,\nthese are things that we have to do.\n\n00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:46.720\nWe have to demand, we have to expect.\n\n00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.640\nAs Cloud surface providers on the\nplatform, as customers we have to validate\n\n00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.630\nthey're happening thru third\nparty audits and attestation.\n\n00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.300\nVery, very important for\nus to think about those things.\n\n00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.750\nI know that we wanted to be able\nto talk about some of the broader\n\n00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.900\nimplications with regards\nto things like OAS.\n\n00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.490\nI think we're gonna do that on our\nnext segment just because we wanna\n\n00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.860\nbe able to give that enough time to really\nthoroughly go through that conversation.\n\n00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.910\nBut in an upcoming episode, we're gonna\nencourage you to come back and watch,\n\n00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.770\nwe're gonna talk about some of the top\nten web vulnerabilities that affect Cloud\n\n00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.500\nwith regards to the OWASP top ten\nweb application security projects.\n\n00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.830\nWe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.430\nReal important.\nWant you to come back and\n\n00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.592\nhear that conversation.\n\n00:33:24.592 --> 00:33:28.520\nWe're gonna wrap up our general\nconversation with regards to the overview\n\n00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.720\nand the entry points for\n\n00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.818\nthe Cloud in this particular group\nof shows that we've been doing.\n\n00:33:33.818 --> 00:33:35.745\nAnd we wanna invite you to come back and\n\n00:33:35.745 --> 00:33:39.165\ndo all that along with, if I can\ncome up with something really cool,\n\n00:33:39.165 --> 00:33:43.305\nmaybe a quick visualization on what\na data center actually looks like.\n\n00:33:43.305 --> 00:33:44.995\nWe'll see if we can take\na look at that as well.\n\n00:33:44.995 --> 00:33:47.985\n>> Wow, that will be awesome,\nI'm totally looking forward to that.\n\n00:33:47.985 --> 00:33:49.655\nAnd obviously as we've gone through today,\n\n00:33:49.655 --> 00:33:53.650\nwe've seen there's a lot of inherent\nrisks and just risks in general.\n\n00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:56.450\nJust because we're going to the Cloud\ndoesn't mean we're without risk even\n\n00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.230\nthough we do tend to think that way,\ndon't we?\n\n00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:59.470\nWe tend to think, well,\n\n00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.264\nI get to shovel this risk off-\n>> Sure.\n\n00:34:01.264 --> 00:34:02.800\n>> To my Cloud provider.\n\n00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.709\nThere you go.\nYou take care of that for me, and\n\n00:34:04.709 --> 00:34:08.255\nnot that doesn't happen in some way,\nshapes or forms, but that that doesn't\n\n00:34:08.255 --> 00:34:11.772\nabrogate us from our responsibilities\nto make sure our environment is safe.\n\n00:34:11.772 --> 00:34:15.758\nAnd we've got to know what it is\nwe're making it safe from if we can't\n\n00:34:15.758 --> 00:34:20.840\nidentify those things, then we're just\nout there swinging our fists at the wind.\n\n00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.604\nIt does a whole lot of nothing for us.\n\n00:34:22.604 --> 00:34:25.350\nAdam, we do appreciate you\npointing these out to us.\n\n00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:28.220\nAnd I really look forward to seeing\nthose top ten vulnerabilities\n\n00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:29.270\nin the next episode.\n\n00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:30.620\nHopefully, you guys do as well.\n\n00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.570\nWe thank you for dropping by and\nwe're gonna see you in the next episode.\n\n00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.450\nHopefully we'll see you guys there as\nwell, we're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.950\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.200\n>> And I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n00:34:40.150 -->

ITPRO.TV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.559\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and in\ntoday's episode, we're continuing on with\n\n4\n00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:24.599\nour Certified Cloud Security Professional\nseries joining us back in the studio yet\n\n5\n00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.232\nagain, to round up the big number,\nI think we're on number six right now,\n\n6\n00:00:28.232 --> 00:00:30.170\nis our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.725\nAdam, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:33.200\n>> [LAUGH] How's everybody doing?\n\n9\n00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.020\nSo we're gonna continue our conversations,\nand I think yeah, it may be six.\n\n10\n00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.870\nI don't even know, I lost track\naround three, after I blacked out and\n\n11\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.420\ncame to I lost track\nof what we were doing.\n\n12\n00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.990\nWhat happened?\n\n13\n00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.720\nWhat?\nWhere am I?\n\n14\n00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.530\nWhat are we doing?\n\n15\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.110\nSo, we're gonna talk, or continue talking\nabout it, and as Daniel pointed out,\n\n16\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.510\nwrap up our conversations about the\nintroductory areas of knowledge we need to\n\n17\n00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.600\nlay out for you CCSB's.\n\n18\n00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.860\nWe're gonna talk about something near, and\ndear to my heart, near and dear to all\n\n19\n00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.950\ncloud security professionals, as a matter\nof fact, should be near, and dear to you.\n\n20\n00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.820\nDan is going to help us put this up\non screen here in just a second.\n\n21\n00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.870\nWith the OWASP website, specifically,\nand OWASP has, so many things, so\n\n22\n00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.350\nmany good things we could talk\nabout from a cloud perspective, so\n\n23\n00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.260\nwe're gonna show you the overall\nOWASP website, OWASP dot org.\n\n24\n00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.280\nThe open web applications\nsecurity project, but\n\n25\n00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.870\nonce we do that we're gonna take\nyou specifically to the OWASP.\n\n26\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.240\nTop ten web vulnerability list,\nand this is a downloadable PDF,\n\n27\n00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.410\nthat we're gonna go through they\nare a list of top ten concerns,\n\n28\n00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.300\nthey're put out every three years.\n\n29\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.020\nThe most current version is 2013 version,\nit will be updated late in the year\n\n30\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.690\nin 2016, so at some point after this\nepisode, is put in the cam so to speak,\n\n31\n00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.950\nand you're watching there will be an\nupdated 2016 version of this list, but for\n\n32\n00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.090\nnow, we're gonna show you what the current\noperating version is at the time we're\n\n33\n00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760\nshooting, which is the 2013 list.\n\n34\n00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.310\nCan we go to Daniel's screen real quick,\nand just take a look at that?\n\n35\n00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.070\nSo we have the overall OWASP website,\nOWASP.org, you should be going out,\n\n36\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.180\njust like you should to the CSA,\nthe Cloud Security Alliance website, and\n\n37\n00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.250\ntake a look at what OWASP has to offer.\n\n38\n00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.480\nThey've got guidance in a variety of\nareas, many of which are very pertinent,\n\n39\n00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.840\nvery important, very functional for\nthe cloud security professional.\n\n40\n00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.300\nDaniel's already preflighted this, but\n\n41\n00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.030\nhe's just gonna show you by clicking\non the Top 10 link right there.\n\n42\n00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.890\nRemember that when you go out to the\nwebsite, they may occasionally move these\n\n43\n00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.510\nthings around so, you'll want to go a lot\nto the site, and make sure you know how\n\n44\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.320\nto find it, but when we do that we go\nto the OWASP Top Ten Project list.\n\n45\n00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.820\nTheir landing page there, and then where\nI am sitting in the box right above\n\n46\n00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.760\nwhere the link is,\nif you actually move up,\n\n47\n00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.920\nor you may have to actually move me out\nof the way to see that, there you go.\n\n48\n00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.658\nYou could see the links under\nQuick Download, on the right for\n\n49\n00:02:36.658 --> 00:02:41.470\nthe Top 10 2013 PDF, again, we've\nalready loaded this up ahead of time, so\n\n50\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.700\nDaniel's gonna bring that up for us,\nwe're gonna take a look at that.\n\n51\n00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.810\nThat's the cover page for the guide that\nwe're looking at, and about what is it,\n\n52\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.760\nsomething like 10, or\n12 pages in approximately?\n\n53\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.460\n>> It is on the sixth page actually.\n\n54\n00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.170\n>> The sixth page in, so\nDaniel's gonna take us out there, and\n\n55\n00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.450\non the sixth page we actually have\nthe summary over view of each one of these\n\n56\n00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.010\nareas that we have to be concerned with,\nand we want to know what they are.\n\n57\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.240\nKind of, go through them from\nA1 all the way through A10,\n\n58\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.460\nand we're gonna talk\nquickly about each one.\n\n59\n00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.590\nWe'll see them come up in several\nplaces in our conversations, but\n\n60\n00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.140\nwe do want to make sure,\nwe are aware of them.\n\n61\n00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.440\nWhen we think about the injection attack,\nor the concept of an injection attack,\n\n62\n00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.010\nwe're thinking about injection flaws or\nconcerns, typically with SQL databases for\n\n63\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.180\ninstance so, this is a big deal with\nonline databases that web enabled.\n\n64\n00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.990\nBanks suffer from this for\ninstance because they tend to\n\n65\n00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.020\nenable their web front ends\nwith form based access control,\n\n66\n00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.720\nand form based entry to be able\nto allow users to access content.\n\n67\n00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.745\nLook at, and execute requests against\ntheir data, on the back end for transfer\n\n68\n00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.265\nof funds, update of balances, there's all\nsorts of stuff, and it's not just banks.\n\n69\n00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:48.535\nIt's anybody the web\nenables the data front end,\n\n70\n00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:52.465\nthe idea is that injection attacks can\ntake place, if we're not paying special\n\n71\n00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:55.952\nattention to the fact,\nthat the data being put in to these forms,\n\n72\n00:03:55.952 --> 00:04:00.262\nis going to be validated, we need to put\nvalidation, but for overflow controls,\n\n73\n00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:03.752\nif we don't structure our data,\na controlled structure of that data.\n\n74\n00:04:03.752 --> 00:04:07.482\nThen we're essentially living with garbage\nin, garbage out as a concept, and if we\n\n75\n00:04:07.482 --> 00:04:12.772\nallow unstructured data in, that error\ninside the system may be propagated into\n\n76\n00:04:12.772 --> 00:04:17.870\na denial service attack, maybe propagated\ninto an access control overflow where we\n\n77\n00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.310\nare given more rights than we should have,\nall sorts of bad things can happen here.\n\n78\n00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.520\nSo, we do need to understand, and\nbe aware of that very, very important.\n\n79\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.900\nWhen we deal with A2 which\nare broken authentication, and\n\n80\n00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.610\nsession management concerns, we're dealing\nwith essentially links, authentication.\n\n81\n00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.950\nFunctions that may be related to being\nable to get in, and do session management,\n\n82\n00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.640\nthings like that.\n\n83\n00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.240\nWe may have a problem, we may have\nan issue where that authentication\n\n84\n00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.000\nis either not happening correctly, so\nwe're allowing a false, positive meaning\n\n85\n00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.970\nsomebody's essential seeing this being\nval when their not supposed to be, and\n\n86\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.650\nwe either do, or don't let them in as\na result of that, so that can be an issue.\n\n87\n00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.530\nWe also may have incorrect\nsession timeout's,\n\n88\n00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.870\nwe may allow for session replay,\ncredentials to be used over,\n\n89\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.660\nand over again essentially to propagate a\nsession out beyond the time out value, so\n\n90\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.850\nif we're not doing things like session\ntime outs, single session keys,\n\n91\n00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.230\nwe could actually be, allowing situations\nlike replay a tax, masquerade, and\n\n92\n00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.130\nspoof attacks to occur, and\npeople can essentially be knocked offline.\n\n93\n00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.830\nSomebody can assume their identity,\ntake over their session, reconnect, and\n\n94\n00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.070\ncarry out the session as,\n\n95\n00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.750\nif they were still essentially that user\nwhen in effect we know that they're not.\n\n96\n00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.540\nThese are all things that can occur, if\nwe're not addressing these concerns, and\n\n97\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.850\nso, we want to make sure people cannot\nassume other's identities through\n\n98\n00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.290\nsome sort of malfeasance, or bad act, and\nbroken authentication session management\n\n99\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.980\nconcerns may allow that to occur,\nso we have to be aware of that.\n\n100\n00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.670\nCross-site scripting attacks,\nwhat are known as, XSS attacks.\n\n101\n00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.200\nThis is the idea, can we zoom in\njust a little bit more, just so\n\n102\n00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.600\nthat I can, you're gonna lose\nthat on the frame, right?\n\n103\n00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.500\nScroll over the other way so you can see,\n\n104\n00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.160\nmaybe just keep that in there,\nperfect, all right.\n\n105\n00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.500\nSo the idea with XSS,\n\n106\n00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.710\nI just want you to make sure you can\nreally see the description here, and\n\n107\n00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.680\nthe reason is, is that a lot of times\npeople will confuse cross site scripting\n\n108\n00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.460\nattacks, and something we're gonna\nget to a little later which is\n\n109\n00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.460\nWhich is a cross site request forgery,\nwhat's called a CSRF, attack.\n\n110\n00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.710\nAnd we'll see the two, and you'll be able\nto compare them, but sometimes, if you're\n\n111\n00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.090\nnot really paying attention to details,\npeople will often get these confused,\n\n112\n00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.240\nbecause they're just quickly\nthinking about the logic, and\n\n113\n00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.120\nsay, yeah, that kind of attack.\n\n114\n00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.820\nA cross-site scripting attack is\nessentially, as you can see there,\n\n115\n00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.710\nwhere an application takes untrusted\ndata as input, and essentially grabs it,\n\n116\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.520\nand puts it in the web browser,\nremember all these are web-enabled, right?\n\n117\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.170\nSo this is all occurring, with some\nsort of web API, and a web application.\n\n118\n00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.880\nTypically a web browser,\nit may not be a web browser,\n\n119\n00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.480\nit may be an application that consumes web\nservices, but somehow we're connecting\n\n120\n00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.870\nan app to the web, whatever that is,\nand so whatever that front end is,\n\n121\n00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.440\nright, we take that untrusted data,\nwe send it in to the web app.\n\n122\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.630\nWithout proper validation, or without\nproper understanding of what that data is,\n\n123\n00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.270\nand as a result,\nthe problem becomes that a bad actor can\n\n124\n00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.490\nessentially push untrusted data in to\nthe app masquerading, as good data.\n\n125\n00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.350\nAnd then take over the app essentially\nexecute an attack against that local\n\n126\n00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.770\nsystem where the app is running, or\npropagate that through our network.\n\n127\n00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.910\nAnd use that connection to reach out and\nattack other systems, and so\n\n128\n00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.760\nthis becomes a cascading effect.\n\n129\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.300\nThat pushes the bad action out into the\nnetwork at large, flooding the network,\n\n130\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.780\ncuz we've given the bad actor\na single point of entry\n\n131\n00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.600\nwith untrusted data being taken onto, a\nmachine that views it as being legitimate.\n\n132\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.752\nThis is a cross side scripting attack, so\n\n133\n00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:35.210\nwhen we have malware\nembedded in web pages, and\n\n134\n00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.650\nwe execute it without realizing it, this\ncan lead to cross-eyed scripting attack.\n\n135\n00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.323\nSo, Iframe attacks are famous for\nthis where a zero by zero frame,\n\n136\n00:07:43.323 --> 00:07:47.915\nrunning in the web page, you move over\nthat space, even though it's not defined,\n\n137\n00:07:47.915 --> 00:07:52.510\nand you don't see it, and malware's\nlurking there, and execute's a script, or\n\n138\n00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.709\nsomething like that, an ActiveX control,\nor Java applet or whatever, and\n\n139\n00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.124\ntakes over the control.\n\n140\n00:07:58.124 --> 00:08:00.494\nInjects data and\nthen essentially propagates the attack.\n\n141\n00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:01.456\nThat can be a problem.\n\n142\n00:08:01.456 --> 00:08:03.560\nThat's what cross-eyed scripting is.\n\n143\n00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.510\nInsecure direct object references.\n\n144\n00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.700\nThis is where we are essentially,\nas we're highlighting there as we go,\n\n145\n00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.560\nwe're essentially having the ability or\nallowing the ability to\n\n146\n00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:23.980\neither embed some sort of\na directory let's say,\n\n147\n00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.900\nor encode access to a directory or\ndatabase or\n\n148\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:31.970\na file or any of those things that are\ntalking, talked about there up at the top.\n\n149\n00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.256\nWhen we expose a reference\nto that we essentially.\n\n150\n00:08:35.256 --> 00:08:36.394\nNah, I can see this fine, thank you.\n\n151\n00:08:36.394 --> 00:08:37.277\nI appreciate that.\n\n152\n00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:40.304\nSo, I have a big sun showing up in\nthe cloud as I'm trying to read.\n\n153\n00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:44.185\nSo, you know what we're doing is\nessentially as the developer, right,\n\n154\n00:08:44.185 --> 00:08:48.441\nwe are either putting in a hard-coded\npath or we're putting in a credential, or\n\n155\n00:08:48.441 --> 00:08:51.948\nwe're putting something into the code,\nunderlying the web app or\n\n156\n00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.417\nunderlying the access that makes\nthe developer's life easier.\n\n157\n00:08:55.417 --> 00:08:57.868\nOr I'm gonna hard code in this\npath to the directory server,\n\n158\n00:08:57.868 --> 00:09:01.500\ncuz it's always gonna be, you know,\none, two, three, A, B, C, or whatever.\n\n159\n00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.650\nI'm just gonna put that in, so I don't\nhave to prompt my user for it every time.\n\n160\n00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.270\nMakes it easier on the user.\n\n161\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.770\nWell, it may, but the reality is it\nmakes it a more insecure process.\n\n162\n00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.353\nAnd if as an attacker,\nI get access to that code,\n\n163\n00:09:12.353 --> 00:09:16.133\nI open it up with some sort of a tool\nthat can decompile the code, right,\n\n164\n00:09:16.133 --> 00:09:19.787\nessentially strip it down,\nlook at the lines of the code, and then,\n\n165\n00:09:19.787 --> 00:09:23.075\nI can see that reference,\nI may get a username and a password.\n\n166\n00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:27.026\nI may get a path that tells me internally\nhow that app works and where to go.\n\n167\n00:09:27.026 --> 00:09:31.265\nAnd then, I could use something like a\ndirectory traversal attack to essentially\n\n168\n00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:34.398\nwalk through the system knowing\nwhat the end point is I want,\n\n169\n00:09:34.398 --> 00:09:36.993\nbecause it's been predefined\nby the developer.\n\n170\n00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:41.157\nAnd as a result of it being hard-coded, I\nnow have essentially a road map that tells\n\n171\n00:09:41.157 --> 00:09:45.390\nme is the bad actor exactly what system to\ntarget, where to go, and how to get to it.\n\n172\n00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.530\nThese are very, very problematic things.\n\n173\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.530\nSo, we don't want this\nkinda stuff happening.\n\n174\n00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.490\nSecurity misconfiguration,\nthis could be any number of things, right?\n\n175\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:58.550\nThis could be the fact that we\nshould be using SSL and/or TLS,\n\n176\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:03.100\nand instead we are using an unsecure\nprotocol to connect to web data remotely.\n\n177\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.540\nSo HTTP versus HTTPS, right,\nhypothetically, is one example.\n\n178\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.640\nWe may want to use HTTP on port 80, but\n\n179\n00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:17.000\nwe may also wanna use HTTPS on port 443,\nprovide a secure connection alternative.\n\n180\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.058\nFor not using both,\nthat can actually prove to be an issue.\n\n181\n00:10:20.058 --> 00:10:23.720\nWe’ve been wanna randomize the port\nassociation for secure connection for\n\n182\n00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.870\nan internal lab.\n\n183\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.702\nIf we don't publish that and\ndo that correctly,\n\n184\n00:10:26.702 --> 00:10:28.780\nthat could be a security misconfiguration.\n\n185\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.680\nA lack of patch management could\nbe a security misconfiguration.\n\n186\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.308\nThere's all sorts of stuff\nthat can happen there.\n\n187\n00:10:33.308 --> 00:10:34.725\nWe just have to be aware of that.\n\n188\n00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:38.530\nNumber A6, secure data or\nsensitive data exposure.\n\n189\n00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.990\nThis could be something like not\nobfuscating, not tokenizing,\n\n190\n00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.940\nnot scrubbing, and not cleaning data\nwhen it is being used by a web app.\n\n191\n00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.230\nSo, we may go ahead, for instance, and\nput our account number, right, or at least\n\n192\n00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:54.200\na portion of it into a web app in order\nto validate that we own that account.\n\n193\n00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.700\nIf the provider doesn't scrub the data and\ntokenize it and\n\n194\n00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:01.720\njust show little asterisks, instead of the\nactual account information on the page,\n\n195\n00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.130\nthat is potentially a sense\nof data exposure concern.\n\n196\n00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.090\nIf they are transmitting that\ndata without hashing it,\n\n197\n00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.060\nso that they're sending the data and\nthen, they're not encrypting the data,\n\n198\n00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.230\nand they're actually sending the data,\n\n199\n00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:18.100\nnot a representation of it, that is a\nsensitive data exposure event potentially.\n\n200\n00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.810\nSo, when we log onto an LDAP directory,\n\n201\n00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:24.510\nwe don't actually transmit our\nuser name and password directly.\n\n202\n00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.600\nWe send a hash representation of\nthat data to do an integrity check.\n\n203\n00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.830\nThis does two things.\n\n204\n00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:33.430\nIt provides confidentiality protection for\nthe actual credential, cuz we're not\n\n205\n00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.530\nreally sending the credential, and it\nvalidates the existing credential that's\n\n206\n00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.840\nalready on file against that being\nprovided by the authentication of them,\n\n207\n00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.850\nright, essentially the user that's\nlooking to authenticate the identifier.\n\n208\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:51.130\nAs the user or the subject submits\nthat data, we hash that data.\n\n209\n00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.650\nWe cryptographically change the data\nrepresented as a string of alphanumeric\n\n210\n00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.470\noutput, certain fixed bit.\n\n211\n00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.590\nWe compare that hash against the known\nhash stored in the database registered or\n\n212\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.830\ncreated during the user's\nregistration event.\n\n213\n00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.510\nThe two match.\n\n214\n00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.560\nWe know the user's valid or at least\nwhoever's at the keyboard is valid.\n\n215\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.390\nWe don't know who they really are, but we\nknow they have the right credential, and\n\n216\n00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:12.340\nwe let them in.\n\n217\n00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.100\nBut if they don't match,\nwe don't let them in.\n\n218\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.810\nWe never actually send the credential.\n\n219\n00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.070\nAnd as a result,\nwe cut down on the potential exposure for\n\n220\n00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.170\nthat sensitive data.\n\n221\n00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.550\nThese are things to consider.\n\n222\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:25.330\nMissing function, or missing level\naccess controls of some kind.\n\n223\n00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.190\nSo, the idea is that we should\nhave mandatory access control,\n\n224\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.700\nhypothetically, where users and\ndata are both classified and\n\n225\n00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.680\ncompared for access, and we don't do that.\n\n226\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.880\nThat would be a missing\naccess control of some kind.\n\n227\n00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.510\nWe're supposed to do dual\nfactor authentication with both\n\n228\n00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.870\nsomething we have, so let's say maybe\na smart cart, and something we are,\n\n229\n00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:49.080\na biometric device of some kind, so\nan iris scan or something like that.\n\n230\n00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.563\nAnd as a result of doing that,\nit would be a relatively secure solution.\n\n231\n00:12:53.563 --> 00:12:58.502\nIf we allow a user, or a application, or\nservice proxying on behalf of the user,\n\n232\n00:12:58.502 --> 00:13:03.372\nto gain access without executing both\nfactors of the authentication challenge\n\n233\n00:13:03.372 --> 00:13:07.659\nsuccessfully, we allow either\nan out-of-band communication, or\n\n234\n00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:11.314\na some sort of unmonitored\nexternal control to take place.\n\n235\n00:13:11.314 --> 00:13:13.777\nAnd as a result of that,\nthat pathway,right,\n\n236\n00:13:13.777 --> 00:13:16.775\nis being used to bypass\nthe controls to gain access.\n\n237\n00:13:16.775 --> 00:13:19.845\nThat's gonna be a missing function\nlevel access control exploit, and\n\n238\n00:13:19.845 --> 00:13:21.065\nthat's gonna be a potential issue.\n\n239\n00:13:21.065 --> 00:13:26.455\nCross-site request forgery, this is the\none I said is often confused with a XSS,\n\n240\n00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:30.780\na cross-site scripting, excuse me,\na cross-site scripting attack.\n\n241\n00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.070\nWe wanna make sure we are familiar with\nits subtle but important difference here.\n\n242\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.140\nThey both start out with cross- sites so\nwe wanna note that.\n\n243\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.660\nRequest forgery is about taking and\nusing illegitimate credentials and\n\n244\n00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.200\npresenting them in such\na way that we think or\n\n245\n00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:49.130\nwe assume, whoops, we assume that\nwe are seeing them and using them,\n\n246\n00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:51.010\nwhen, in fact,\nthey're not really supposed to be used.\n\n247\n00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.650\nSo, you can see there,\nthis forces a logged on victim's browser\n\n248\n00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:59.200\nto send a forged request,\nincluding the victim's session cookie, and\n\n249\n00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:04.780\nany other authentication information that\nmay be registered to a vulnerable web app.\n\n250\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:09.260\nBy doing this, this allows the attacker\nto force the victim's browser to generate\n\n251\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:15.550\nthe requests that will then essentially\nbe executed by the vulnerable app.\n\n252\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.865\nWe're pretending to be somebody we're not,\nso what we do here, it's not us pretending\n\n253\n00:14:19.865 --> 00:14:23.622\nit's a website pretending and saying,\nI really am a legitimate website.\n\n254\n00:14:23.622 --> 00:14:26.687\nYou should trust me, run this script,\neverything will be fine.\n\n255\n00:14:26.687 --> 00:14:27.708\nRight, I work for the government.\n\n256\n00:14:27.708 --> 00:14:29.890\nOf course, you can trust me, right?\n\n257\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.830\nSo, the reality is that when that happens,\n\n258\n00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:37.390\nthe website itself may be the bad actor\nand it may be proxying essentially, right?\n\n259\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.070\nNow we're into the system, and\n\n260\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.150\nthe bad actor is trying to fool you into\ntrusting it to let it run the malware.\n\n261\n00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:47.740\nThe way we could deal with this is, we can\nreverse authenticate websites to the app.\n\n262\n00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.080\nInstead of us authenticating\nto the website,\n\n263\n00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.760\nwe can have the website\nauthenticate to us.\n\n264\n00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.100\nAnd by doing that, we prove and\nvalidate the identity of that website.\n\n265\n00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.790\nAnd this is being done more and\nmore today.\n\n266\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.840\nReverse authentication of websites is\nbeing done in highly-secured environments\n\n267\n00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.320\nto eliminate essentially\nthe possibility of this kind of attack,\n\n268\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.970\nat least one way, potentially two.\n\n269\n00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.840\nIt's not the only way, but\nit's one of the ways we tend to do this.\n\n270\n00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.120\nAnother way,\nthere are many other ways as well, but\n\n271\n00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.220\nthis is one of the more common ones.\n\n272\n00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:16.420\nWe may use something called\nan out-of-band communication path or\n\n273\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.000\na external challenge.\n\n274\n00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.112\nWe're essentially, yeah and\nyou may see this with your banking sites,\n\n275\n00:15:21.112 --> 00:15:24.274\nthings like that, where you log on,\nyou get to a certain point, it says,\n\n276\n00:15:24.274 --> 00:15:27.558\nokay, how do you want me to send you\nthis communication challenge, right?\n\n277\n00:15:27.558 --> 00:15:31.259\nMicrosoft bought a company a couple years\nago called Phone Factor, that does this,\n\n278\n00:15:31.259 --> 00:15:34.240\nand they are kind of one of\nthe industry leaders behind this.\n\n279\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.924\nSo, they'll send you a text or\nan email, or\n\n280\n00:15:36.924 --> 00:15:40.565\na phone call will be generated\nwith a six or eight digit pin.\n\n281\n00:15:40.565 --> 00:15:43.626\nYou got to put that pin in as\na separate challenge to authenticate\n\n282\n00:15:43.626 --> 00:15:46.575\nthat it's really you and\nthat the website contacted you, and\n\n283\n00:15:46.575 --> 00:15:49.485\nthe website won't let you in\nwithout the proper challenge.\n\n284\n00:15:49.485 --> 00:15:52.150\nAnd you don't get on the website\nunless it takes a challenge, and\n\n285\n00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.245\nthe two are mutually\nauthenticated to each other.\n\n286\n00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.925\nAnd as a result, if you get past that and\neverybody agrees,\n\n287\n00:15:56.925 --> 00:16:01.106\nthe idea is that the site's probably not\nforged, and you're probably not rating,\n\n288\n00:16:01.106 --> 00:16:04.310\nbecause how else would that\ncommunication take place, right?\n\n289\n00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.990\nSo there's different ways\nto do this today, but\n\n290\n00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:08.340\nit's kinda cool technology\nwhen you think about it.\n\n291\n00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.610\n>> Yeah, they increased that complexity,\nright, and that's what.\n\n292\n00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:12.930\n>> Exactly,\nthey're increasing the complexity, and\n\n293\n00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:17.250\nthat's what causes ultimately\nthe cross eye requests forgery to\n\n294\n00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.200\nnot be successful because both parties\nhave to essentially be dumb, right?\n\n295\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.000\nThey both have to trust blindly for\ncross eyed request forgery to work.\n\n296\n00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.170\nAnd if we're, as you said,\n\n297\n00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.860\namping up the complexity and forcing both\nparties to trust, but trust but verify,\n\n298\n00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.270\nand that's the part that actively takes\non the management to validate this.\n\n299\n00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:35.860\nThe trust but\n\n300\n00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.690\nverify stance attempts to eliminate the\ncross-site request forgery opportunity,\n\n301\n00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.070\nat least in many cases, anyway, so\nthat's something we wanna consider.\n\n302\n00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.240\nUsing components with known\nvulnerabilities, this is just plain dumb.\n\n303\n00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.490\nI don't know how else to say it.\n\n304\n00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.780\nIf you're falling prey to this it's\nbecause somebody said to you hey,\n\n305\n00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.900\nyou see that thing in the corner over\nthere that if you sit on collapses and\n\n306\n00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:55.970\nyou're gonna hurt yourself?\n\n307\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.010\nDon't sit on it.\n\n308\n00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.800\nThen you go and sit down on it and\ncomplain that you hurt yourself.\n\n309\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.590\nThat's just dumb.\n\n310\n00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.880\nI don't know what else to say.\n\n311\n00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.480\nSo, don't be that guy, right.\n\n312\n00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.380\nDon't be dumb.\n\n313\n00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.520\nYou don't want to use components that you\nhave known vulnerabilities with even if\n\n314\n00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.720\nyou're patch managing them to successfully\nimplement them properly you have to\n\n315\n00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.420\ndocument the risk of the fact that you're\nstill taking on a known vulnerability,\n\n316\n00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.994\neven though you may be\nmitigating it with a control.\n\n317\n00:17:17.994 --> 00:17:20.240\nSo you have to be really\ncareful with this stuff, right?\n\n318\n00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.480\nUsing insecure code libraries,\nfor instance, in C# or\n\n319\n00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.730\nVisual Basic or Java or whatever.\n\n320\n00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:29.870\nThere are known code libraries\nout there that are insecure, and\n\n321\n00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.040\nyou should just not allow them\nto be used in compiled code.\n\n322\n00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.320\nIt's a good best practice for development.\n\n323\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.870\nIf you're developing and writing on\nthe c platform using the insecure\n\n324\n00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:43.540\ncode libraries, shame on you, and shame on\nyou for allowing that to occur, as a CCSP.\n\n325\n00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.470\nShould just switch over\nto the secure versions.\n\n326\n00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:48.800\nAnd I know that sounds easy when I say it.\n\n327\n00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.970\nI know I make it sound\nlike it's no big deal.\n\n328\n00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.740\nI understand you may have to rip\nthen replace huge volumes of\n\n329\n00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.930\ncode that have been coded\nthe wrong way for years.\n\n330\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.220\nI get the implications of\nwhat I'm saying to you,\n\n331\n00:17:58.220 --> 00:17:59.760\nI see it everyday in the real world.\n\n332\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:04.150\nBut what I'm telling you is that it's your\njob as a security professional to make\n\n333\n00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:09.440\nthe organization aware of these risks and\nto formulate a battle plan.\n\n334\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.580\nAnd that the journey of a 1,000 miles, as\nConfucius would often say, begins with but\n\n335\n00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:14.370\na single step.\n\n336\n00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:17.970\nIf you never take that step to\nstart mitigating these concerns,\n\n337\n00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.850\nthey will always be there and you will\nnever, ultimately, gain the advantage\n\n338\n00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:25.100\nbecause that actress will always have\nthe open doors to walk through and\n\n339\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.810\nthis is a very big issue for\nus as security professionals.\n\n340\n00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:29.050\n>> Adam does this go back to,\n\n341\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.910\nwe were talking earlier\nabout we have to stay agile.\n\n342\n00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.700\nWe have to stay ahead of the game.\n\n343\n00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.600\nWe start seeing new technologies come out.\n\n344\n00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.010\nWe have to implement them because, once\nthey become old and become embedded, and\n\n345\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.530\nthey do become that vulnerable,\nthe piece of our network or\n\n346\n00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:45.440\npiece of our environment,\nwe don't want to let it go.\n\n347\n00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.010\nI've seen it a million times,\npeople are like, we can't get rid of that,\n\n348\n00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.970\nthat runs our business and if we get rid\nof it we're basically shutting our doors.\n\n349\n00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.010\nAnd so they don't want to let those, even\nthough they have known vulnerabilities,\n\n350\n00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:57.510\nthey're using code with\nvulnerable libraries.\n\n351\n00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:58.930\nIs that why you see that?\n\n352\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.510\n>> Very very large portion of it\ncertainly can be interoperability and\n\n353\n00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.670\nbackward compatibility with line of\nbusiness apps and may be hard coded.\n\n354\n00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:12.000\nSo for instance, in the manufacturing\nsectors, a lot of my clients there,\n\n355\n00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.130\nlarge huge manufacturing concerns\nthat have automated assembly lines,\n\n356\n00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.827\nthings like that.\n\n357\n00:19:16.827 --> 00:19:20.830\nA lot of these ICS,\ncyber physical embedded scotia systems\n\n358\n00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:23.680\nfall into this category where we're\ntalking about technology, in some cases,\n\n359\n00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.870\nmay be 20, 30, 40 years old.\n\n360\n00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:28.630\nAnd that, although it's been\nupdated at certain levels for\n\n361\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.280\nthe vendor to do what they have to do, you\nknow we're talking about technology that\n\n362\n00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:37.100\nwas never meant to be run on a web enabled\nIP interfaces that are encrypted because\n\n363\n00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:40.970\nthere's no such thing as encryption in\nthe protocol stack on these systems.\n\n364\n00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:41.870\nIt just doesn't exist.\n\n365\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:42.800\nIt's not there.\n\n366\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:47.380\nSo when you expose these systems by\nweb-enabling them and IPifying them,\n\n367\n00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.190\nessentially, putting an IP address,\nexternal IP, right on them and\n\n368\n00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.920\nthen allowing for\n\n369\n00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.440\nremote management, we get these concerns\nwhere we gotta run these systems.\n\n370\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.770\nCuz there's just no other way\nto run a power plant today.\n\n371\n00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.010\nI mean, it is what it is.\n\n372\n00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.100\nThe challenge is we wanna\nremotely manage them.\n\n373\n00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:05.120\nWe want to web enable them, we're opening\nthem up into a situation or potentially\n\n374\n00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.620\nconnecting them to a situation that\nthey were never designed to be run in.\n\n375\n00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.410\nAnd that architecture is problematic and\nso\n\n376\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.410\nit's risk assessment cost benefit\nanalysis conversation now.\n\n377\n00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.330\nAnd that's the kind of thing we\nare talking about, absolutely.\n\n378\n00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:19.820\nThere are many other examples of that,\nbut that is just one example.\n\n379\n00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.070\nAnother one,\nvery simple one you may see would be,\n\n380\n00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.000\nyou know just do a quick self-assessment.\n\n381\n00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.940\nThose of you that are still running\nWindows XP, for whatever reason, and\n\n382\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.310\nthere are legitimate reasons.\n\n383\n00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.650\nI have customers, again, in the\nmanufacturing sector in certain industries\n\n384\n00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:37.950\nthat have XP enabled work stations\non the floor of these factories.\n\n385\n00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.720\nRunning aspects of a manufacturing process\n\n386\n00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.460\nbecause the vendor software that runs\nthat, was designed to run on that system.\n\n387\n00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.080\nIt's never been upgraded and\nit's not gonna be.\n\n388\n00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.540\nThey made it clear, that's what it is.\n\n389\n00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.970\nSo if you have the liability\nrunning in XP system today and\n\n390\n00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.225\nyou allow that thing to be connected to\na production network that sees the web,\n\n391\n00:20:55.225 --> 00:20:57.420\nyou've got a major\nliability on your hands.\n\n392\n00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:00.630\nSo what they do is they essentially\nfirewall that entire segment of\n\n393\n00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.820\nthe network off, they disconnect\nit from anything remotely, and\n\n394\n00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.380\nthey run it totally isolated.\n\n395\n00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.690\nIt's not a great solution but\nit gets the job done.\n\n396\n00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.810\nBecause now you've essentially isolated\nthat box and the security liability of\n\n397\n00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:15.310\nhaving an unpatched network\naccess point has been minimized.\n\n398\n00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:17.050\nIt's not been totally removed but\n\n399\n00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.070\nits been minimized to this\nlarger degree as possible.\n\n400\n00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.170\nThese are examples of the kinda thing\nyou're talking, but I see them everyday,\n\n401\n00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.160\nsee them all the time with customers.\n\n402\n00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.690\nAnd then A10,\nUnvalidated Redirects and Forwards.\n\n403\n00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:28.136\nThere we go, look at that.\n\n404\n00:21:28.136 --> 00:21:28.863\n>> A little crazy.\n\n405\n00:21:28.863 --> 00:21:30.559\n>> Woo, great if I blew up as big as that.\n\n406\n00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:32.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So A10, right?\n\n407\n00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.810\nUnvalidated Redirects and Forwards.\n\n408\n00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:38.535\nThis is the idea of potentially being\nbounced from one machine to another,\n\n409\n00:21:38.535 --> 00:21:43.785\nyou click on a link thinking you're going\nto I want to download my software.com and\n\n410\n00:21:43.785 --> 00:21:47.985\nyou're going to here's my malware.org and\nnobody knows that and\n\n411\n00:21:47.985 --> 00:21:50.164\nyou get a nasty surprise, right?\n\n412\n00:21:50.164 --> 00:21:55.230\nAnd so this is happening all the time,\nagain, reverse authentication of websites.\n\n413\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.720\nDNSSEC would be a good example of\nhow to counteract this as well,\n\n414\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.630\nwhere we're digitally signing zone records\nthat we know the zone is valid and\n\n415\n00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:04.755\nwe're not being redirected\nwithout knowledge.\n\n416\n00:22:04.755 --> 00:22:05.700\nThere's things you can do,\n\n417\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.695\nyou should be looking at URLs before\nyou click on them and making sure that\n\n418\n00:22:09.695 --> 00:22:14.270\nmalware.org is not at the end of that URL\nbecause that's not somewhere you wanna go.\n\n419\n00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.284\nAs stupid as that sounds, as obvious\nas that sounds, users are just clicking\n\n420\n00:22:18.284 --> 00:22:22.360\nright, because they're not paying\nattention, for instance, a lot of users\n\n421\n00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.523\ndon't know that we can hover over URL or\nweb enable link and see the URL, right?\n\n422\n00:22:26.523 --> 00:22:29.904\nAnd see the actual location that's\nunderlying the text of click\n\n423\n00:22:29.904 --> 00:22:32.908\nhere on a button and\nactually see what it resolves to, and\n\n424\n00:22:32.908 --> 00:22:37.288\nwhen you do that you'll see it goes off to\ncome crazy website, who knows where, and\n\n425\n00:22:37.288 --> 00:22:39.997\nif that's the case you don't click on it,\nright?\n\n426\n00:22:39.997 --> 00:22:43.350\nAnd this is rule number one in regards\nto things like phishing attacks.\n\n427\n00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:45.750\nSo you have to understand how\nto deal with these things.\n\n428\n00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.610\nSo things like phishing\nattacks are good examples of\n\n429\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.970\nnon validated re recs and forwards.\n\n430\n00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:54.220\nThings like masquerading and spoofing\nattacks, man in the middle attacks,\n\n431\n00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.200\nall potentially fall\ninto these categories.\n\n432\n00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.140\nAnd we have to be very aware of,\nvery cognizant,\n\n433\n00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.860\nvery concerned about these liabilities,\ncuz there really is a major,\n\n434\n00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.870\nmajor issue, and a concern out\nthere with these kinds of attacks.\n\n435\n00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.570\nAll of these come to us from\nthe OWASP top ten lists.\n\n436\n00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:11.870\nAs CCSB candidates, you need to\nknow these top ten vulnerabilities.\n\n437\n00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.760\nYou should be able to knowledgeably\ndiscuss each one, have a sentence or\n\n438\n00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.130\ntwo summary of what the issue is,\nlike you've heard me and\n\n439\n00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.220\nDaniel kinda run through here and\ntalk about.\n\n440\n00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.410\nYou should be knowledgable.\n\n441\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.120\nYou should be comfortable with\nunderstanding what they are.\n\n442\n00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.430\nYou have to speak about them.\n\n443\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.490\nYou have to answer questions about them.\n\n444\n00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.700\nAnd you wanna make sure you can do so.\n\n445\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:33.510\nIf you need to study on them,\nfollow up so to speak.\n\n446\n00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.490\nDo a little reading,\nnothing like going to the OAS website,\n\n447\n00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:39.320\ndownloading that nice PDF,\ngoing to page six, right?\n\n448\n00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.950\n>> Page six.\n>> Going to page six and\n\n449\n00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.460\ngoing to that summary list and\ngoing through them.\n\n450\n00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.120\nMake sure you make some flash cards.\n\n451\n00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.417\nDo whatever you need to do but\n\n452\n00:23:46.417 --> 00:23:49.880\nmake sure you understand how to not\nonly identify those vulnerabilities but\n\n453\n00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.416\nhow to counteract or counter man them,\nas I've been talking about with you.\n\n454\n00:23:53.416 --> 00:23:56.751\nWe often talk about these vulnerabilities\nwith regards to the data life cycle,\n\n455\n00:23:56.751 --> 00:23:58.058\nsecure cloud data life cycle.\n\n456\n00:23:58.058 --> 00:24:00.387\nWe're gonna put back up I\nbelieve From my mistake.\n\n457\n00:24:00.387 --> 00:24:00.937\nLook at that.\n\n458\n00:24:00.937 --> 00:24:02.307\nThat is just awesome.\n\n459\n00:24:02.307 --> 00:24:04.754\nThis is almost like voice control.\n\n460\n00:24:04.754 --> 00:24:06.752\nI can just say, put it up and there it is.\n\n461\n00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:07.575\nOutstanding.\n\n462\n00:24:07.575 --> 00:24:09.770\nSo, we're gonna have our cloud\nsecurity data life cycle.\n\n463\n00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:11.837\nDaniel was kind of enough\nto document this for us.\n\n464\n00:24:11.837 --> 00:24:16.733\nSo all kudos for the graphics work, go to\nthe gentleman standing off to the side of\n\n465\n00:24:16.733 --> 00:24:20.840\nthe camera here and you could see him\nwhen we go back to our full shot.\n\n466\n00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:23.823\nSo when we're talking about\ngetting into the data lifecycle,\n\n467\n00:24:23.823 --> 00:24:26.492\n12 o'clock position and\nwe're gonna go clockwise.\n\n468\n00:24:26.492 --> 00:24:27.233\nCorrect?\n>> Yes.\n\n469\n00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:30.324\n>> So we're gonna start up there with\nCreate, eyesight's not what it used to\n\n470\n00:24:30.324 --> 00:24:33.529\nbe at the beginning of the day at the end\nof the day, a little bit harder to see.\n\n471\n00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:36.661\nSo we're gonna say, at the top of the data\nlifecycle where to start with that,\n\n472\n00:24:36.661 --> 00:24:37.668\nwe're gonna create it.\n\n473\n00:24:37.668 --> 00:24:41.627\nSo this could be a user,\nactually creating data.\n\n474\n00:24:41.627 --> 00:24:45.319\nRemember, this could also be\nan application creating data or\n\n475\n00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:48.093\nproxying on behalf of\nthe user to create data.\n\n476\n00:24:48.093 --> 00:24:50.346\nThis could be a service\nthat's creating data.\n\n477\n00:24:50.346 --> 00:24:52.145\nIt's not just a user is my point.\n\n478\n00:24:52.145 --> 00:24:56.847\nWe often talk about users, but we really\ntalk about is the subject creating data\n\n479\n00:24:56.847 --> 00:25:01.074\nand the subject can be a user,\ncan be a service, can be an application.\n\n480\n00:25:01.074 --> 00:25:03.755\nSo, we're starting with\nthe idea of creating data.\n\n481\n00:25:03.755 --> 00:25:08.606\nWhen we create data, we are thinking about\ninformation being classified, categorized,\n\n482\n00:25:08.606 --> 00:25:12.018\nunderstanding what it is,\nhow to use it, those kind of things.\n\n483\n00:25:12.018 --> 00:25:13.519\nWe then deal with storing data.\n\n484\n00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:16.398\nStoring data is gonna be short,\nmedium and long-term.\n\n485\n00:25:16.398 --> 00:25:19.254\nSo we're gonna put it into some\nsort of storage mechanism.\n\n486\n00:25:19.254 --> 00:25:23.319\nIt could be a cache, your dynamic memory\nlocation while it's temporary storage\n\n487\n00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:25.002\nwhile we're actively using it.\n\n488\n00:25:25.002 --> 00:25:28.339\nIt could be longer term storage where\nwe're routed to a local drive or\n\n489\n00:25:28.339 --> 00:25:32.436\nout an archive storage facility across\nthe network for long-term, deep storage.\n\n490\n00:25:32.436 --> 00:25:33.076\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n491\n00:25:33.076 --> 00:25:34.050\nStorage is storage.\n\n492\n00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.152\nSo, we're gonna worry custoidanship.\n\n493\n00:25:36.152 --> 00:25:38.636\nWho's gonna manage the data short,\nmedium or long-term?\n\n494\n00:25:38.636 --> 00:25:40.808\nWho's gonna oversee if\nunder what conditions?\n\n495\n00:25:40.808 --> 00:25:43.268\nCan we expect that data to be maintained?\n\n496\n00:25:43.268 --> 00:25:47.529\nWe have to then focus on usage, cuz all\ngood data that's created at some point has\n\n497\n00:25:47.529 --> 00:25:51.600\nto have value for us to consider it to be\nuseful and the value is really in the use\n\n498\n00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.756\nof the data extracting\nthe information contained within.\n\n499\n00:25:54.756 --> 00:25:57.149\nSo, we're gonna put that data in to one or\nmore applications.\n\n500\n00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:58.473\nConsume it and interact with it.\n\n501\n00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:00.597\nModify it and\nmanipulate it in various ways.\n\n502\n00:26:00.597 --> 00:26:01.677\nSo, we're gonna use it.\n\n503\n00:26:01.677 --> 00:26:03.233\nWe're probably gonna share it.\n\n504\n00:26:03.233 --> 00:26:04.137\nWe're gonna collaborate.\n\n505\n00:26:04.137 --> 00:26:06.018\nWe're gonna send data out to individuals.\n\n506\n00:26:06.018 --> 00:26:07.668\nWe're gonna send data out to groups.\n\n507\n00:26:07.668 --> 00:26:08.852\nThey're gonna use it.\n\n508\n00:26:08.852 --> 00:26:11.592\nThey're gonna send it to us,\nall sorts of things are gonna happen.\n\n509\n00:26:11.592 --> 00:26:16.045\nOvertime, we're to put data into\nan archive state that will ultimately\n\n510\n00:26:16.045 --> 00:26:17.140\nbe a long-term,\n\n511\n00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:21.824\nvery, very unlikely to use data very\noften when it's in archived storage.\n\n512\n00:26:21.824 --> 00:26:25.683\nSo it's gonna be a long-term storage\nfacility, so we're gonna think about that.\n\n513\n00:26:25.683 --> 00:26:29.555\nAnd then overtime, we have to worry about\nand think about who's gonna get into that\n\n514\n00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:33.594\narchive facility, under what jurisdiction\nis that data stored, under what legal and\n\n515\n00:26:33.594 --> 00:26:37.004\nstatutory ramifications will that\ndata be maintained and for how long?\n\n516\n00:26:37.004 --> 00:26:38.513\nWhat are retention policies involved?\n\n517\n00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:40.405\nDo we have a seven year cycle,\n\n518\n00:26:40.405 --> 00:26:44.962\nas most businesses do in the United States\njust from a tax perspective?\n\n519\n00:26:44.962 --> 00:26:46.321\nLet alone anything else.\n\n520\n00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:49.807\nThere are other industries that may be\nheavily regulated That may require less or\n\n521\n00:26:49.807 --> 00:26:50.327\nmore time.\n\n522\n00:26:50.327 --> 00:26:51.383\nIt really just depends.\n\n523\n00:26:51.383 --> 00:26:52.742\nThere's a lot of things to go on there.\n\n524\n00:26:52.742 --> 00:26:54.484\nAnd then ultimately, destruction.\n\n525\n00:26:54.484 --> 00:26:56.086\nThis is the end of the data lifecycle.\n\n526\n00:26:56.086 --> 00:26:57.409\nHow do we safeguard?\n\n527\n00:26:57.409 --> 00:27:01.306\nAnd ultimately then, through the use of\ndata decide at the end of the retention\n\n528\n00:27:01.306 --> 00:27:04.625\nperiod to get rid of data successfully and\nunder what conditions.\n\n529\n00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:07.956\nSo we do have to make sure we understand\nthat cloud security data lifecycle is\n\n530\n00:27:07.956 --> 00:27:09.057\nvery, very important.\n\n531\n00:27:09.057 --> 00:27:13.627\nAs a CCSP, you are expected to know\nthe six stages of the data lifecycle\n\n532\n00:27:13.627 --> 00:27:18.043\nin order like any good process,\nany good flow that has direction and\n\n533\n00:27:18.043 --> 00:27:20.464\nprocess stages associated with it.\n\n534\n00:27:20.464 --> 00:27:21.588\nYou need to know them in order.\n\n535\n00:27:21.588 --> 00:27:25.511\nYou need to know that we use after we\nstore and that we use after we create and\n\n536\n00:27:25.511 --> 00:27:27.599\nthat while it makes sense when I say it,\n\n537\n00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:31.235\nit has to make sense to you in the exam\nin order for you to get it right.\n\n538\n00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:34.636\nSo, make sure you understand the six\nstages of the secure data lifecycle.\n\n539\n00:27:34.636 --> 00:27:36.772\nIt's very, very important for\nyou to be aware of them.\n\n540\n00:27:36.772 --> 00:27:40.238\nI don't have a good mnemonic for them, but\n\n541\n00:27:40.238 --> 00:27:44.678\nyou should come up with\nsomething C-S-U-S-A-D.\n\n542\n00:27:44.678 --> 00:27:50.298\nCSU SAD, I don't know if that\nreally works or not, but CSU sad.\n\n543\n00:27:50.298 --> 00:27:51.938\nYeah, I can't come up with\na better one right now, but\n\n544\n00:27:51.938 --> 00:27:53.092\nthat will have to work for the moment.\n\n545\n00:27:53.092 --> 00:27:54.580\nBut come up with something,\n\n546\n00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.683\nwhich you need to know the six\nphases of the data lifecycle.\n\n547\n00:27:57.683 --> 00:27:59.395\nWe also have to think\nabout information and\n\n548\n00:27:59.395 --> 00:28:01.210\ndata governance types\nwith regards to this.\n\n549\n00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:05.466\nI was mentioning data classification and\nthe idea of classifying data, and\n\n550\n00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:09.736\nunderstanding what data classification\nmay be during the creation phase.\n\n551\n00:28:09.736 --> 00:28:13.518\nWe need to make sure we understand\nlocation and jurisdictional policies,\n\n552\n00:28:13.518 --> 00:28:17.850\nboth during store, during use, during\nshare, during archive and during destroy.\n\n553\n00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.605\nManagement policies over sight of data,\nauthorization, custodianship,\n\n554\n00:28:22.605 --> 00:28:27.224\nwho's responsible for managing\ninformation on behalf of the data owner.\n\n555\n00:28:27.224 --> 00:28:29.786\nData owners are responsible for\nclassifying data.\n\n556\n00:28:29.786 --> 00:28:32.760\nCustodians are responsible for\nimplementing that classification and\n\n557\n00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.495\nmanaging data day to day moments\nin moment on behalf of the owner.\n\n558\n00:28:35.495 --> 00:28:38.109\nSo we need to think about that,\nwe need to understand that.\n\n559\n00:28:38.109 --> 00:28:41.478\nWe need to constantly be focused\non confidentiality, integrity and\n\n560\n00:28:41.478 --> 00:28:42.997\navailability in this regard.\n\n561\n00:28:42.997 --> 00:28:46.549\nAnd understand how those three things\ncome into play here not just on the data\n\n562\n00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:48.269\nlifecycle, but across the cloud and\n\n563\n00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:50.618\nthroughout all the different\nareas of the cloud.\n\n564\n00:28:50.618 --> 00:28:54.732\nWe have to worry about BCDR, business\ncontinuity disaster recovery planning.\n\n565\n00:28:54.732 --> 00:28:58.134\nBoth during the creation,\nthe storage, the usage, the sharing,\n\n566\n00:28:58.134 --> 00:29:00.833\ncertainly the archival and\nthe destruction of data.\n\n567\n00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:03.151\nWe don't wanna destroy data\nbefore we're supposed to.\n\n568\n00:29:03.151 --> 00:29:06.823\nWe wanna ensure availability of data at\nall phases of the life cycle prior to\n\n569\n00:29:06.823 --> 00:29:10.903\ndestruction, but we wanna make sure that\nwhen destruction is handled correctly,\n\n570\n00:29:10.903 --> 00:29:12.379\ndata is no longer available.\n\n571\n00:29:12.379 --> 00:29:15.143\nSo we have different focal points,\ndepending on the phase and\n\n572\n00:29:15.143 --> 00:29:17.749\nwe need to understand business\ncontinuity management and\n\n573\n00:29:17.749 --> 00:29:19.890\ndisaster recovery planning\nin these regards.\n\n574\n00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:23.252\nAnd we'll have a lot more to say about\nthese things in upcoming episodes, but\n\n575\n00:29:23.252 --> 00:29:25.681\nit is gonna be very important for\nus to be aware of that and\n\n576\n00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:26.891\nto be thinking about that.\n\n577\n00:29:26.891 --> 00:29:30.719\nWe also have to think about determining\nmaximum tolerable down time and\n\n578\n00:29:30.719 --> 00:29:35.272\nother criteria, such as recovery point\nobjectives and recovery time objectives.\n\n579\n00:29:35.272 --> 00:29:39.160\nWe'll talk about these more in upcoming\nconversations about the cloud operations,\n\n580\n00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.946\nbut how do we deal with these concerns?\n\n581\n00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:42.072\nHow do we measure for\n\n582\n00:29:42.072 --> 00:29:46.579\nRPO the maximum amount of data we're\nwilling to lose during the recovery event,\n\n583\n00:29:46.579 --> 00:29:50.174\nwhat is acceptable as a loss in\nother words to the organization?\n\n584\n00:29:50.174 --> 00:29:55.144\nWith regards to MTD, how do we understand\nthe most outer band or measurement of\n\n585\n00:29:55.144 --> 00:29:59.606\ntime allowable for the system to be\noffline before we have a disaster?\n\n586\n00:29:59.606 --> 00:30:01.545\nThat's what maximum tolerable downtime is.\n\n587\n00:30:01.545 --> 00:30:04.526\nHow do we understand RTO,\nrecovery time objective?\n\n588\n00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:09.494\nThe earliest possible time in the arc of\nrecovery prior to MTD where we hope we can\n\n589\n00:30:09.494 --> 00:30:12.548\nrestore our system,\nif everything goes right.\n\n590\n00:30:12.548 --> 00:30:15.495\nThat's our earliest target or\nwindow for restoration.\n\n591\n00:30:15.495 --> 00:30:17.340\nMTD is the outer boundary or\n\n592\n00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:22.003\nband of that restoration window\nprior to us having a disaster occur.\n\n593\n00:30:22.003 --> 00:30:25.899\nWe have to think about those things and\nunderstand them, and we have to weigh,\n\n594\n00:30:25.899 --> 00:30:28.675\nand measure those with regards\nto risk management, and\n\n595\n00:30:28.675 --> 00:30:30.823\nunderstand data management in the cloud.\n\n596\n00:30:30.823 --> 00:30:35.115\nThe need to have that data available\n24 by 7 and we cannot survive and\n\n597\n00:30:35.115 --> 00:30:39.337\ncannot function without that data\nbeing available, then our MTD and\n\n598\n00:30:39.337 --> 00:30:43.045\nour RPO is gonna be very,\nvery low if not nonexistent at all,\n\n599\n00:30:43.045 --> 00:30:45.850\nbecause the data has to\njust always be there.\n\n600\n00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.567\nIf we could survive for\n24 hours without the data,\n\n601\n00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:50.728\nthen our MTD may actually be 24 hours and\n\n602\n00:30:50.728 --> 00:30:54.705\nwe have to think about how that sliding\nscale works and what that looks like.\n\n603\n00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:58.914\nSo things like critical success factors\naround data management, MESLA's,\n\n604\n00:30:58.914 --> 00:31:02.815\na service level agreements used to\nenforce them become very important.\n\n605\n00:31:02.815 --> 00:31:05.030\nMeasures of up time,\nhow do we measure up time?\n\n606\n00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.734\nWe traditionally do that\nwith a nine measures.\n\n607\n00:31:07.734 --> 00:31:12.157\nSo 99 point something percent for up time,\nminimum typically of three nines, which\n\n608\n00:31:12.157 --> 00:31:16.475\nindicates approximately about eight and\nthree-quarter hours of down time a year.\n\n609\n00:31:16.475 --> 00:31:18.896\nSo, between eight or\nnine hours of downtime a year.\n\n610\n00:31:18.896 --> 00:31:21.296\nI did say, a year,\nby the way, for three nines.\n\n611\n00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:23.765\nThat's the standard these days,\nby the way,\n\n612\n00:31:23.765 --> 00:31:28.088\nwith most of these online cloud hosting\ncompanies, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.\n\n613\n00:31:28.088 --> 00:31:32.197\nYour typically going to have a least a 3-9\nguarantee, which means you're being given\n\n614\n00:31:32.197 --> 00:31:35.702\na guarantee of essentially between 8 or\n9 hours of down time over the course\n\n615\n00:31:35.702 --> 00:31:39.570\nof a 12-month operational period where\nyou may not be able to access the system.\n\n616\n00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.520\nThat's not gonna be all chunked into\nthe last day of the year where they\n\n617\n00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.574\ntake it offline for\nthree-quarters of the day.\n\n618\n00:31:44.574 --> 00:31:46.379\nThat's just a of couple minutes here and\n\n619\n00:31:46.379 --> 00:31:48.567\nthere over the course of\nan average usage cycle.\n\n620\n00:31:48.567 --> 00:31:52.284\nAnd over time, that adds up to between\neight to nine hours of downtime, but\n\n621\n00:31:52.284 --> 00:31:54.939\nthat's still a very small\namount of downtime when you\n\n622\n00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:58.373\nthink about the number of hours in\na day and the number days in a month.\n\n623\n00:31:58.373 --> 00:32:00.010\nAnd ultimately,\nthe number of days in a year.\n\n624\n00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.598\nThat's a lot of hours to be up and\nvery few to be down.\n\n625\n00:32:02.598 --> 00:32:07.214\nSo, we want to think about that Having to\nmake sure we understand our responsibility\n\n626\n00:32:07.214 --> 00:32:10.540\nas the customer versus\nthe responsibility of the provider.\n\n627\n00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:14.320\nWe talked a lot about this with regards\nto the data management component and\n\n628\n00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.100\nin general just the understanding\nof what the provider's gonna do and\n\n629\n00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.440\nwhat we're gonna do in the IAS,\npass and SaaS arenas.\n\n630\n00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.610\nWe've talked about this and\n\n631\n00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:26.270\ndata plays a very important part\nin every one of those discussions.\n\n632\n00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.210\nBut it's about where the data is and\n\n633\n00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.540\nwho is managing it that we'd\nreally have to focus on.\n\n634\n00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:34.110\nDepending on the service model, the answer\nis going to be very very different, right,\n\n635\n00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.810\nas we've established, we've talked about.\n\n636\n00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:39.650\nSo your SLAs are going to become very\nimportant to help us manage through this\n\n637\n00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:43.230\nUnderstanding how SLA's will\nshape the conversation about\n\n638\n00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.280\nensuring there's no\nsingle point of failure.\n\n639\n00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.430\nEnsuring that our RTO or\nRPO or RTV's are well defined.\n\n640\n00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.865\nMaking sure that we understand\nwhat the escalation chain is for\n\n641\n00:32:52.865 --> 00:32:54.100\nproblem resolution.\n\n642\n00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:55.320\nAnd what the penalties are for\n\n643\n00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.140\nlack of commitment to hitting those marks\nall have to be factored in to SLAs.\n\n644\n00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.250\nI don't know if you've ever had, you know,\nDaniel in your time just on the other\n\n645\n00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.470\nside, on the administrationary, I don't\nknow if you ever got a chance during that\n\n646\n00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.995\ntime to actually take a look at an SLA or\nread one.\n\n647\n00:33:10.995 --> 00:33:14.305\nAnd most customers I have, when I say,\nhey, have you run your SLA, they're like,\n\n648\n00:33:14.305 --> 00:33:19.035\nwe have it somewhere but I didn't sign it,\npurchasing or legal or HR or\n\n649\n00:33:19.035 --> 00:33:22.195\nfinance or whoever,\nsome combination of those got involved,\n\n650\n00:33:22.195 --> 00:33:24.925\nand we kind of said what we want,\nwho we're going to go with.\n\n651\n00:33:24.925 --> 00:33:26.895\nThey ultimately negotiated it.\n\n652\n00:33:26.895 --> 00:33:28.335\nI said I wanted this company.\n\n653\n00:33:28.335 --> 00:33:29.065\nI never really saw it.\n\n654\n00:33:29.065 --> 00:33:30.435\nI just know we went with them.\n\n655\n00:33:30.435 --> 00:33:32.400\nSo a lot of customers say\nI've never actually seen it,\n\n656\n00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.700\nnd I don't really know what's in it.\n\n657\n00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.320\nI know in theory what's there,\nbut I've never actually seen one.\n\n658\n00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.210\nAnd there's all this urban myth and\nlegend around SLAs and what they do and\n\n659\n00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:40.150\ndon't look like.\n\n660\n00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.500\nYou know, number one, they're not\nmulti volume massive documents.\n\n661\n00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.320\nThey're actually relatively small,\nmore often than not.\n\n662\n00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.550\nThey're five, six,\nseven pages; in some cases,\n\n663\n00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.360\nmaybe a little bit longer,\nmany cases relatively short.\n\n664\n00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.150\nA couple of pages, three to four pages and\n\n665\n00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.480\nmost typically they're\nnot very complicated.\n\n666\n00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.007\nThey may be in a appendice\nto a hosting agreement,\n\n667\n00:33:57.007 --> 00:34:00.440\na codicil in other words of\na larger contractual vehicle.\n\n668\n00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.230\nBut you know you have to go out and\nlook for these things.\n\n669\n00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:03.130\nYou have to have a copy of them,\n\n670\n00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:07.080\nyou have to understand what's in\nthem to understand what's going on.\n\n671\n00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:10.340\nAre you doing continuous monitoring\nof all the infrastructure that has\n\n672\n00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.020\nto be maintained?\n\n673\n00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.230\nIs the SLA documenting that?\n\n674\n00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.470\nHave you done a cost benefit analysis,\nand is that\n\n675\n00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.760\nfactored into the hosting agreement around\nthat machine data and those things?\n\n676\n00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:22.930\nAre we shifting as we said CapX to OpX\nexpenses, have we documented that,\n\n677\n00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:24.600\ndo we understand what that is?\n\n678\n00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.490\nAnd how that's happening.\n\n679\n00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:29.640\nAre we factoring in the time we may\nbe saving by offsetting that time for\n\n680\n00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:33.010\nmanaging the data and\nthe documentation of that to a vendor.\n\n681\n00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:37.270\nAnd then what are we doing to capture that\nand put that back into the organization?\n\n682\n00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:41.920\nOne of the big myths and legends about\ncloud is that we're gonna fire all the IT\n\n683\n00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:47.630\npeople, outsource to some unnamed cloud\nprovider, Acme Cloud or whatever, right.\n\n684\n00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.910\nAnd there's gonna be like dust\nbunnies blowing down the hallways\n\n685\n00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:53.800\nof the organization, and\nall you'll hear are crickets chirping,\n\n686\n00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.320\ncuz there won't be anybody there.\n\n687\n00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.000\nRight, go back to the idea of War Games,\nright if we go back to the War Games\n\n688\n00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.720\nmovie, where they pulled all the humans\nout of the missile silos right?\n\n689\n00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.760\nRemember you see them at one point their\npulling the chairs out of the silos,\n\n690\n00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.680\nwhy don't we, we don't need chairs\nanymore right, there's no humans, so\n\n691\n00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.010\nall they have are the computers.\n\n692\n00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:12.820\nAnd so when we do that, that's what\nthat vision of cloud was like initially.\n\n693\n00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.350\nThat's actually not the case at all.\n\n694\n00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.370\nIn many cases,\n\n695\n00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:18.910\nwe take those same people that would have\nbeen managing that infrastructure and\n\n696\n00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:23.475\nwe now task them with monitoring, we task\nthem or repurpose them to do other things.\n\n697\n00:35:23.475 --> 00:35:27.155\nWe may see some of them leave the\norganization, some may go to other places,\n\n698\n00:35:27.155 --> 00:35:31.305\nmay do other things, but that's not\nnecessarily the outcome all the time, and\n\n699\n00:35:31.305 --> 00:35:34.755\nwe still need IT professionals\nto run the IT infrastructure.\n\n700\n00:35:34.755 --> 00:35:36.135\nWe just need less of them and\n\n701\n00:35:36.135 --> 00:35:39.520\nwe need different skills in order\nto do the things that are left.\n\n702\n00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.680\nMonitoring and\nmanagement now become the key focal point.\n\n703\n00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.360\nAnd so becoming that interface to\nthe cloud provider becomes critical.\n\n704\n00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.410\nAnd so understanding how to do\nthe cost benefit analysis and\n\n705\n00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.910\nreally getting that information\nis gonna be critical.\n\n706\n00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:55.730\nWe often talk about the fact\nthat we can't monitor it and\n\n707\n00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.030\nmeasure it, we really don't\nunderstand how to manage it.\n\n708\n00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.880\nAnd that's the byword,\nthe watch word of the cloud.\n\n709\n00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.290\nWe really have to think about the fact\nwe have to monitor, we have to measure\n\n710\n00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.770\nin order to manage, and the IT\nprofessionals now focus in that area.\n\n711\n00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:10.545\nAnd to that end they are gonna need\nguidance, they're gonna need standards,\n\n712\n00:36:10.545 --> 00:36:12.090\nthey're gonna need training.\n\n713\n00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.780\nHow do we now understand\nhow to monitor and\n\n714\n00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:17.920\nmanage a cloud based infrastructure\nbeing offered by a third party provider?\n\n715\n00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.940\nWell we have to pick a tool,\n\n716\n00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.610\nwe have to use the APIs that\nthe cloud provider gives us.\n\n717\n00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:23.570\nAnd we have to get trained\non how to do that.\n\n718\n00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.860\nWe have to understand the extent of\nthe management capabilities that they\n\n719\n00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.520\nafford us.\n\n720\n00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.020\nAnd there may be guidance that\nwe can look to in the industry.\n\n721\n00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.730\nThings like ISO standards\nas I mentioned already.\n\n722\n00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:35.700\nThe 27,000 series for IT security.\n\n723\n00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.990\nThings like attestation reports,\nSOC1, SOC2, and SOC3.\n\n724\n00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.930\nWe'll talk more about these\nin upcoming episodes.\n\n725\n00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:44.830\nWe may look at guidance like the FIPS.\n\n726\n00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:49.413\nFederal Information Processing Standards,\nright?\n\n727\n00:36:49.413 --> 00:36:54.080\nSo FIPS 140-2, for instance,\n140-2, as one example of a U.S.\n\n728\n00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.000\ncentric set of information security\nstandards that could be used to provide\n\n729\n00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.820\nguidance for how we can consume and\ncertify criteria for cloud consumption.\n\n730\n00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.730\nThe common criteria,\nISO 15408 may be another good example.\n\n731\n00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:07.970\nData certified systems and\n\n732\n00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:12.620\ncreate the proper level of protection\nby using security certified systems.\n\n733\n00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.980\nI mentioned this test SP853R4\n\n734\n00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.610\nwhich are the control elements associated\nwith things like cloud computing and\n\n735\n00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.880\ngenerally information processing in\nthe U.S. federal government today.\n\n736\n00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:28.580\nPCI DSS which are big standards as well\nthat are used for payment processing.\n\n737\n00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:33.370\nAnd the processing of electronic data in\ngeneral across payment systems today.\n\n738\n00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.220\nAny or all of these things are going to\nbe important standards that the cloud\n\n739\n00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.760\nsecurity professional should have\nsome working knowledge of and\n\n740\n00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.300\nshould be aware of with regards to cloud,\ncloud security and\n\n741\n00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.370\nthe risk associated with managing\ncloud infrastructure today.\n\n742\n00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.260\nWell Adam, we've covered a lot of\nground today, we've taken a look in,\n\n743\n00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.100\nspecifically in this episode,\nat the top ten ways in which we need to\n\n744\n00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.440\nbe aware of that people trying to get in\nto our systems, and check up that owasp,\n\n745\n00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.450\nthat is a really great document.\n\n746\n00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.150\nTheir website's full of great information\nlike Adam said, you should be frequenting\n\n747\n00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.595\nthat thing and just diving into it and\nconsuming it as much as possible.\n\n748\n00:38:06.595 --> 00:38:09.820\nCuz that's what you're gonna need to\nbe an effective security practitioner\n\n749\n00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:11.870\nin a cloud-based environment.\n\n750\n00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:15.560\nAdam, is there anything else we\nneed to cover for today's episode?\n\n751\n00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:19.100\nI'm sure there is but we'll pick it up in\nanother episode, that's not a problem.\n\n752\n00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.890\nBut, I think we've done a good so\nfar of laying out that foundational\n\n753\n00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:25.130\nknowledge across six episodes\nwe've spent time with you on.\n\n754\n00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.470\nToday and throughout our conversations,\nwe'll continue to refer back to that stuff\n\n755\n00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:30.510\nand they'll be a lot more good\nstuff to come, I promise.\n\n756\n00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.680\n>> Awesome, well we thank you so\nmuch for joining us today.\n\n757\n00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.559\nThank you for lending your expertise on\nthis very topic that we might become one\n\n758\n00:38:36.559 --> 00:38:39.159\nday, we're paladins now one\nday we might [CROSSTALK]\n\n759\n00:38:39.159 --> 00:38:40.490\n>> CCSPS.\n\n760\n00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:41.570\n>> That's right.\nCCSPS.\n\n761\n00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.930\nEveryone thanks for\nwatching we hope you had a great time.\n\n762\n00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:44.670\nWe hope you enjoyed it.\n\n763\n00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.000\nWe hope you actually learned something.\n\n764\n00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.040\nWe are going to go ahead and\nsign off for ItProTV.\n\n765\n00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.810\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n766\n00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:53.340\n>> I am not Daniel Lowrie,\nI am the shorter version, Adam Gordon.\n\n767\n00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.620\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n768\n00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.159\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n769\n00:38:56.159 --> 00:39:02.254\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.550\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie,\nand today's episode,\n\n4\n00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.680\nwe are continuing on with our certified\nCloud Security Professional series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.710\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday is our good friend, our mentor,\n\n6\n00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.490\nour guiding star on this very journey,\nis Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.430\nAdam welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.070\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.860\n>> You're making me blush.\n\n10\n00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stop.\n\n11\n00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.290\nThat is just too much to say at one time.\n\n12\n00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.890\nI am doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.510\nHopefully everybody is also.\n\n14\n00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.320\nWe are gonna continue with the theme\nthat Daniel just laid out for us,\n\n15\n00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.920\nour journey to the Cloud as we say.\n\n16\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.110\nSo we're gonna continue talking about some\nof the things that are important to us,\n\n17\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.580\nwith regards to the Cloud.\n\n18\n00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.570\nWe wanna do is actually start\nout by reviewing a little bit\n\n19\n00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.240\nof what we've done in some\nof the prior episodes,\n\n20\n00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.810\nspecifically talking about\nthe Cloud data lifecycle.\n\n21\n00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.370\nWe really can't talk about it, or\nat least in theory we shouldn't talk about\n\n22\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.130\nCloud data security,\nunless we first understand, what data is?\n\n23\n00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.789\nHow data's created?\n\n24\n00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.610\nAnd ultimately as a result of that,\nwhere data lives?\n\n25\n00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.080\nWe've talked about that as well, the\ndifferent stages that we may find data in.\n\n26\n00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.390\nWe're gonna zero in on that\nstuff by way of getting started,\n\n27\n00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.620\nso I know that Daniel you put\na great graphic together for\n\n28\n00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.440\nus yesterday with regards to\nthe Cloud data life cycle.\n\n29\n00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.840\nIf we could take a look at that\nreal quick on the screen, and\n\n30\n00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.740\njust remind ourselves, there we go.\n\n31\n00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.270\nThe magic of modern technology.\n\n32\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.630\nAnd we can see what the Cloud\ndata life cycle looks like.\n\n33\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.330\nWe'll begin our conversation by talking\nabout the fact that data is always\n\n34\n00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.440\ncreated, as we figure out\nhow to work with data, and\n\n35\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.080\nit has to come from somewhere, right?\n\n36\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.900\nSomebody or something has to create data.\n\n37\n00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.807\nWe often talk about subjects and objects\nwhen we talk about accessing data with\n\n38\n00:01:42.807 --> 00:01:45.064\nregards to identity and access management.\n\n39\n00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:48.884\nSo if we think about subjects as\nbeing users and or applications or\n\n40\n00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:52.427\nservices the proxy on behalf of\nusers to interact with data,\n\n41\n00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:56.265\nand then we think of data as being\nthe object of that interaction.\n\n42\n00:01:56.265 --> 00:02:00.604\nWe have the idea of subject object, which\nis the general language of access control,\n\n43\n00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:04.522\nbut also important for us to think about\nand to refer to with regards to the data\n\n44\n00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:07.080\nand the data life cycle\nthat we are talking about.\n\n45\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.630\nSo, whether remembers we talked about\nyesterday or talked about in prior\n\n46\n00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.920\nsessions, it is a Cloud item that is\nput in front of it, or in other words,\n\n47\n00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.660\nessentially we say data is Cloud data, or\ndata is in a database, or data is binary\n\n48\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.330\ndata, or it's blob data, or whatever\nfill in the blank kind of data it is.\n\n49\n00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.210\nIt doesn't matter, right?\n\n50\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.890\nData is data.\n\n51\n00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.680\nIt's electronic bits that\nultimately we have to account for,\n\n52\n00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.700\nput somewhere, and manage.\n\n53\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.710\nAnd so when we think about the creation of\ndata, we're thinking about what data is,\n\n54\n00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.090\nand ultimately who is going to be creating\nthe data, or what is creating the data?\n\n55\n00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.260\nAnd then we have to worry about,\nfrom that point of view, or\n\n56\n00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.590\nfrom essentially at that point in time,\nwhat we do with data?\n\n57\n00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.520\nBecause creating it is the beginning\nof a journey, and ultimately we have to\n\n58\n00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.850\nthink about all the things we do after\ncreation that help us to manage data.\n\n59\n00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.400\nSo with regards to the creation of data,\nwe then move to storing data.\n\n60\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.169\nWhere will data live?\n\n61\n00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.820\nAs we think about data,\nwe have to think about the fact that data,\n\n62\n00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.180\nas we've talked about, can exist in\npotentially one of three stages.\n\n63\n00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.390\nOr one of three, areas, if you will.\n\n64\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.690\nWe can think of data in use, so\ndata in an application of some kind,\n\n65\n00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.090\nwhich will be the usage portion of our,\nno, you could stay on store for\n\n66\n00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.480\njust a minute, that's fine.\n\n67\n00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.160\nSo when we think about data in use,\nultimately as we move down, we're thinking\n\n68\n00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.010\nabout the data in an application being\nconsumed, interacting with it, and\n\n69\n00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.820\npotentially sharing it as we move\nthrough the life cycle, right?\n\n70\n00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.390\nBut data in use, are data in transit.\n\n71\n00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.590\nSo as we are thinking about data\non the wire, data moving back and\n\n72\n00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.060\nforth, from one application to another.\n\n73\n00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.460\nIf I send an email right\nover to Daniel saying,\n\n74\n00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.290\nhey can you please add this\ninformation to our agenda for\n\n75\n00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.110\nour meeting later, I'm using data\nI'm also sharing data, right?\n\n76\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.760\nAnd so we have to think about how we\ntransmit data, so data on the wire.\n\n77\n00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.930\nAnd then ultimately data that is going\nto be stored either in temporary dynamic\n\n78\n00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.190\ncaches, some sort of temp file,\nsome sort of register in a system or\n\n79\n00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.900\nlonger term storage this would go into\narchiving later in the life cycle.\n\n80\n00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.750\nWhatever we're doing we have to think\nabout where we're gonna put data short,\n\n81\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.540\nmedium and long term.\n\n82\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.000\nAnd then as a result of that,\n\n83\n00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.660\nhow we're gonna manage that data when\nit shows up in one or more places.\n\n84\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.070\nIf I send that email that we\njust talked about to Daniel and\n\n85\n00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.820\nI say to Daniel, add these five\nitems to our agenda for our meeting.\n\n86\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.790\nAnd by the way, I want you to go ahead and\npull up one or more of those items.\n\n87\n00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.990\nThen I think when you moved\n[INAUDIBLE] I think you actually.\n\n88\n00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.970\n>> I didn't see a wire there.\n\n89\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.930\n>> That or the Cloud was flashing to\ntell us it wants to restart, one or\n\n90\n00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.050\nthe other, so I think it was yeah, I think\nit was just a little loose on the wire\n\n91\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.460\nwhen you moved it, so don't do that, don't\nmove the computer while we're talking.\n\n92\n00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.220\nSo when we send that information\nover to Daniel, and I say,\n\n93\n00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.010\nhey Daniel,\nadd these things to the agenda, but\n\n94\n00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.780\nalso, by the way, I want you to go back to\nthe meeting notes from our last meeting.\n\n95\n00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.250\nI want you to pull them up essentially and\n\n96\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.110\nadd that item that we had to roll\nforward to our agenda as well.\n\n97\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.420\nDaniel may have to go to the archive.\n\n98\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.490\nIf i'd essentially not to go into a file\nshare somewhere, maybe goes to SharePoint.\n\n99\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.040\nSince we have a SharePoint thing going\non it may go to SharePoint rather it may\n\n100\n00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.920\npull it up out of a document library.\n\n101\n00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.040\nHe may go to a Cloud based storage system\nsuch as Dropbox or Box or whatever.\n\n102\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.050\nSo many different places he could go.\n\n103\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.245\nHe may I can just simply go and\nfind that in a file on his local machine,\n\n104\n00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:24.615\nso storing data can really mean different\nthings depending on what kind of\n\n105\n00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:29.483\ndata it is, what kind of classification\nand categorization of data we enforce.\n\n106\n00:05:29.483 --> 00:05:31.035\nAnd we're gonna talk\nabout classification and\n\n107\n00:05:31.035 --> 00:05:34.035\ncategorization as we\nget into data security.\n\n108\n00:05:34.035 --> 00:05:37.545\nThe idea of understanding how\nto essentially define value for\n\n109\n00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:41.340\ndata is really a classification and\ncategorization implies.\n\n110\n00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.160\nBut it's a question of where\nwe consume that value from.\n\n111\n00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.440\nClassification is really about\ncategorization, excuse can't use\n\n112\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.890\nclassification and categorization in\nthe same sentence to describe each other.\n\n113\n00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:53.810\nClassification is about making\nsure that we understand the value\n\n114\n00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.280\nof the data from the perspective\nof access control.\n\n115\n00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.614\nWhereas categorization is about\nunderstanding the value of data with\n\n116\n00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:03.467\nregards to managing risk and understanding\nimpact and potentially liability.\n\n117\n00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:07.595\nAnd exposure of data and so we have to\nthink about what we're doing with data as\n\n118\n00:06:07.595 --> 00:06:11.342\nwe put it into storage to understand\nhow to manage risk essentially but\n\n119\n00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:16.044\nalso manage access to ensure availability\nprovide for confidentiality protections,\n\n120\n00:06:16.044 --> 00:06:18.480\nbut also to ensure\nthe integrity of the data.\n\n121\n00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.970\nAnd then as we move through and\nwe go through use, share and archive.\n\n122\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.650\nEventually we get to a point in time where\nthe data is gonna be deemed to be ready to\n\n123\n00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.030\nbe destroyed, meaning it either no\nlonger has value in our organization or\n\n124\n00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.880\nthe useful life of that\ndata has been exceeded, or\n\n125\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.670\nthe value is no longer relevant.\n\n126\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.010\nOr any number of reasons\nwhy we wanna destroy data.\n\n127\n00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.820\nIt's a slow Monday,\nwe got nothing going on.\n\n128\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.620\nWe may need a hobby but we don't have one,\n\n129\n00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.490\nwhatever the case may be,\nwe're gonna destroy data.\n\n130\n00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.590\nSo Daniel, when we go to destroy data,\nwhat in your mind what would you think\n\n131\n00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.550\nof as saying would be essentially\na good way to destroy data?\n\n132\n00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.090\nIn other words, a secure way,\na way that's risk adverse,\n\n133\n00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.750\na way that would align with\nour data management policies.\n\n134\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.710\nWhat would come into your mind?\n\n135\n00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.580\nWhat would you think?\n\n136\n00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.980\n>> Typically, I've seen them used\nlike giant shredding machines.\n\n137\n00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:12.237\nWhere we take the actual physical\ndiscs that the data lies on and\n\n138\n00:07:12.237 --> 00:07:15.374\nthen we put it through some sort\nof destruction mechanism and\n\n139\n00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:18.960\nit physically destroys the disc so\nthat it cannot be recreated.\n\n140\n00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.590\nThat's probably one of the best ways I\ncan think of to actually get rid of that.\n\n141\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.275\nAnother way is just like scrubbing\nthe data off of the disc if you're gonna\n\n142\n00:07:25.275 --> 00:07:32.320\nre-allocate that actual space and\nusing like the government level,\n\n143\n00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.360\nwhere it writes ones and zeros and\nthen erases it, writes ones and continues.\n\n144\n00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.100\n>> Multiple overwrites.\n\n145\n00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.060\n>> Right.\nMultiple overwrites.\n\n146\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.640\n>> Okay.\nSo multiple overwrites, a good way.\n\n147\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.380\nA big fancy shredding machines,\nanother good way to do it.\n\n148\n00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.110\nBasically, we may have a menu of options\nis my point and what Daniel's describing\n\n149\n00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.180\nis essentially several different ways or\nat least two of them anyway.\n\n150\n00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.850\nWe may go through and do other things.\n\n151\n00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.247\nWe may actually physically not just\nshred the drive but liquefy it,\n\n152\n00:07:56.247 --> 00:07:58.996\nessentially through it in a gas furnace or\nsomething.\n\n153\n00:07:58.996 --> 00:08:02.116\nStrap a block of thermite to it,\nwhatever you may do, right.\n\n154\n00:08:02.116 --> 00:08:04.229\nBut will essentially destroy it.\n\n155\n00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:09.032\nAny physical particulate matter associated\nwith the drive render it inoperable in\n\n156\n00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:11.021\nsome way, we may decide to go in and\n\n157\n00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:14.450\nwe may decide to go\ncryptographically erase the data.\n\n158\n00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.998\nAs you said, multiple overwrites.\n\n159\n00:08:15.998 --> 00:08:21.020\nWe may de-gauss the drive, so use a strong\nmagnetic field, to either wipe the drive\n\n160\n00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.240\nor at least rearrange the particles in\nsuch a way that it can't be retrieved.\n\n161\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.800\nBut every one of these options,\n\n162\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.430\nshort of actual physical destruction, and\neven something like a shredding machine.\n\n163\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.760\nDepending on how thorough the shredding\nis, it may leave behind matter,\n\n164\n00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:39.200\nessentially bits of the magnetic platters,\nif it is a normal magnetic drive.\n\n165\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.610\nOr if it is a SSD drive, may leave\nbehind bits of storage mechanism,\n\n166\n00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.040\nthe flash memory essentially, that,\nnot by the average person and\n\n167\n00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.340\nprobably not by the average company,\nbut by certain entities,\n\n168\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.190\ntypically governments entities and\nentities that work for\n\n169\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.860\ngovernments that have letters in their\nname that are typically acronyms, right?\n\n170\n00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.110\nThey may be able to recover some\ndata from those random bits.\n\n171\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.270\nBut the average individual,\nthe average business, the average company\n\n172\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.000\nis probably not gonna be able to\ndo much with that pile of garbage.\n\n173\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.495\nSo, the question really becomes\nwhat level of assurance,\n\n174\n00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:16.620\nright, are we looking for\nin regards to data destruction.\n\n175\n00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.340\nThis is a hard question for\nus to figure out,\n\n176\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.115\nwith regards to not only to the cloud,\nbut in general with anything we do.\n\n177\n00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:24.710\nCuz the old fashioned way of\ndoing this would have been hey,\n\n178\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.350\nI've got a bunch of files in theory,\nright, paper.\n\n179\n00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:31.200\nAnd I'm gonna take that, years ago, and\nas you said, I mean, just shred it.\n\n180\n00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.990\nBut shredding paper, if you used a cross\ncut shredder and you set it to a fine\n\n181\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:41.215\nparticulate output so it essentially\npulverizes the paper, turns it to dust,\n\n182\n00:09:41.215 --> 00:09:44.430\nyou're really not gonna have anything\nleft that could be recoverable.\n\n183\n00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:47.610\nYou may take that and burn it right,\nultimately, so you would then take\n\n184\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.300\na second step and ensure that whatever is\nleft over in theory, would be disposed of.\n\n185\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.430\nAnd that, more or less, would have\nprobably gotten rid of the data and\n\n186\n00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.256\nunless somebody didn't burn everything\nthoroughly or unless somebody went through\n\n187\n00:09:58.256 --> 00:10:01.762\nthe ashes looking for unburned bits,\nthere really would be almost no chance,\n\n188\n00:10:01.762 --> 00:10:05.462\nif not any chance at all, realistically,\nthat data would be recovered, right?\n\n189\n00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:09.126\nAs long as the burn process was thorough,\nas long as we made sure that everything\n\n190\n00:10:09.126 --> 00:10:13.130\nwas destroyed, there really would be no\nway to recover data from that system.\n\n191\n00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:14.140\nAnd that's a good thing.\n\n192\n00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:16.460\nBut the reality is today\nas we've talked about,\n\n193\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.680\nwhile data does exist in multiple\nformat's and paper or microfiche,\n\n194\n00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.480\nthere's an oldy but a goody right,\nmicrofilm, may still be one of them.\n\n195\n00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.740\nThe reality is that more and\nmore today data is being digitized and\n\n196\n00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.440\nultimately data that's\nbeing used consistently and\n\n197\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.410\nactively especially in the cloud,\nhas to be of a digital format.\n\n198\n00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.120\nAnd while there may be back up\ncopies in multiple other format's,\n\n199\n00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.740\nwe're concerned with digital data\nwhen we're thinking about the cloud.\n\n200\n00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.660\nSo as a CCSP, it's our responsibility with\nregards to due care and due diligence.\n\n201\n00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:50.370\nActing with due care, managing and\noverseeing with due diligence to ensure\n\n202\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.910\nthat we come up with the most secure way\nto manage the entire data lifecycle, but\n\n203\n00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.790\nespecially as we move into the last\nphase with regards to destruction.\n\n204\n00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:58.650\nWe have to understand,\n\n205\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:03.010\nand ultimately have to think through,\nthe logic of what destruction may mean.\n\n206\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:08.580\nSecure destruction is the goal, and secure\ndestruction is a relative sliding scale.\n\n207\n00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.305\nWe may be comfortable with simply saying,\nif the data has been\n\n208\n00:11:12.305 --> 00:11:17.520\nremoved from the drive in such a way\nthat it would unlikely to be recovered.\n\n209\n00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.730\nUnlikely is an elastic\nkind of soft spongy term.\n\n210\n00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.050\nIt stretches, right,\ndepending on circumstance.\n\n211\n00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.280\nWe may define that and say, under normal\nconditions, or under these conditions,\n\n212\n00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.740\nwe're fairly comfortable with\nthe removal of the data from the drive.\n\n213\n00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:31.970\nThat may be good enough.\n\n214\n00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.610\nBut it may not be in certain conditions.\n\n215\n00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:37.270\nSo for instance, where Daniel\nyou worked years ago as you and\n\n216\n00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:38.250\nI were chatting, right?\n\n217\n00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.070\nBefore we got started yesterday or before\nwe got started with some of our sessions,\n\n218\n00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.700\nwe talked about the fact that you worked\nfor a certain entity that you, in theory,\n\n219\n00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.100\nwould have secure data requirements,\nright,\n\n220\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.350\njust based on the kind of work you did and\nthe place you worked as an admin.\n\n221\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.390\nYou would have to be making sure\nthat you took care of data.\n\n222\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.700\nYou obviously probably had different\nclassifications for data I'm thinking or\n\n223\n00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.710\nat least categorizations of data.\n\n224\n00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:04.340\nYou may have had both and, as a result,\ncertain data would probably have been able\n\n225\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.430\nto be destroyed just by somebody\nhitting the delete button,\n\n226\n00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.000\nessentially, on a laptop or desktop.\n\n227\n00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.570\nAnd removing it in that way, although it\nreally wasn't removed, would have been,\n\n228\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.930\nmore often than not, good enough.\n\n229\n00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.520\nBut then there would have been\nfinancial data, most likely,\n\n230\n00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.330\nprobably certain records that had to\nbe maintained under requirements for\n\n231\n00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.740\ndata retention and\nwhether it's a sunshine law.\n\n232\n00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.110\nIn the state of Florida,\nwe have a law, most states do,\n\n233\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.770\nthat require certain kinds of data to be\nmaintained for a certain number of years.\n\n234\n00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:34.050\nBoth for state, as well as ultimately\naligned with Federal requirements.\n\n235\n00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.490\nSo most states in the US have this.\n\n236\n00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.170\nThe federal government has laws\nthat require you to retain data as\n\n237\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.250\na business for at least seven years for\ntax purposes, and\n\n238\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.510\nthere may be other laws based on\nregulation and based on industry vertical.\n\n239\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.640\nRight so\nyou may have had to require your people\n\n240\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.000\nto delete data under certain conditions\nbut also deleting under others, right?\n\n241\n00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.050\n>> Yes that's exactly right.\n\n242\n00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:56.800\nThough we would have, when it came to\nstoring data, we did things like tape\n\n243\n00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.100\narchiving, we would put at least a years\nworth of tape archives in fire proof\n\n244\n00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.110\nvaults and keep that around in case\nwe had to go back and gather stuff.\n\n245\n00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.434\nWe did have lawyers that time.\n\n246\n00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:08.797\nWorked for an insurance company, we're\ndefinitely gonna deal with [INAUDIBLE] and\n\n247\n00:13:08.797 --> 00:13:10.775\nas we started digitizing\nall of our paper files.\n\n248\n00:13:10.775 --> 00:13:14.493\nWe had to store all that, we have cross\nsite, we had replication going on,\n\n249\n00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:18.154\nyou name it from over a WAN length from\nFlorida to the Mississippi where our\n\n250\n00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:20.100\ndisaster recovery site was.\n\n251\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.700\nA lot of care went into making sure we had\naccess to that data and then when it came\n\n252\n00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.720\nto destroying it, we hired third\nparty companies to come in and-\n\n253\n00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.370\n>> People that\n\n254\n00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.100\nspecialize,\n>> Exactly.\n\n255\n00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.750\n>> For companies that specialize in that,\nright?\n\n256\n00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.200\nBecause we make it seem like\nit's no big deal, just go and\n\n257\n00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.650\ndrop the drive in the shredder,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.820\n>> And out the bottom comes\n\n259\n00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.960\nthe parts, and you're done.\n\n260\n00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.130\nIt's not that simple.\n\n261\n00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.520\nReality is you have to have people that\nare trained to do this, not because you\n\n262\n00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.840\ncan't drop a drive in the shredder and\nwatch the bits fall out the bottom, but\n\n263\n00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.680\nbecause what you do with the bits\nwhen you're done is really the issue.\n\n264\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.680\nAnd as I said, if you're not careful about\nhow you then ultimately gather up all\n\n265\n00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.970\nthe remnants of the shredding or\nthe destruction or\n\n266\n00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:59.910\nwhatever the process is, and you then\nsecurely deal with those through disposal.\n\n267\n00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.850\nAnd that may be carting them away, and\n\n268\n00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.300\nactually then, having several\nadditional processes to deal with them,\n\n269\n00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.410\nyou may throw them in a chemical bath,\nand etch the drive platters.\n\n270\n00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.080\nSo that way that drive platter\nmaterial's essentially non recoverable.\n\n271\n00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:16.660\nYou may then decide to throw them\ninto some sort of furnace at 2000\n\n272\n00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.400\nplus degrees and liquefy the remaining\ninformation bits or whatever they are.\n\n273\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.460\nYou may choose to securely bury them,\nright?\n\n274\n00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.770\nIn a landfill that is controlled by\nyour company under a long term archival\n\n275\n00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.200\nstorage, deep in the ground, right,\nin a vault somewhere in theory.\n\n276\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.000\nYou pay for these services,\nthere's different ways to deal with this.\n\n277\n00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.100\nPoint is, you're not just gonna put them\nin a trash bag, throw them into the way\n\n278\n00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.760\nstream, and hope nobody realizes that\nthat's the stuff they want to get,\n\n279\n00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.580\nand goes out takes it out of the dumpster,\nright, because that would not be secure.\n\n280\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.210\nAnd so\nin the Cloud we don't have the ability,\n\n281\n00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.110\nas customers, to see this going on.\n\n282\n00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.100\nThis is one of the key issues and\nchallenges.\n\n283\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.075\nCould we put the graphic for\nthe life cycle back up for just a second?\n\n284\n00:14:53.075 --> 00:14:57.935\nSo, the challenge here is that in\nalmost every stage of the life cycle,\n\n285\n00:14:57.935 --> 00:14:59.755\nright, in the create phase or\n\n286\n00:14:59.755 --> 00:15:03.525\nstage, we as the customer, we're actually\ntotally in control of that, right.\n\n287\n00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:08.148\nBecause in theory, while the Cloud service\nprovider is creating data all the time\n\n288\n00:15:08.148 --> 00:15:13.106\nbehind the scenes through management,\nthrough monitoring, through manipulation,\n\n289\n00:15:13.106 --> 00:15:16.467\nand all the things they do on\nthe physical infrastructure.\n\n290\n00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:20.002\nAnd depending on the level that\nwe consume at, PAS, SAS, IS,\n\n291\n00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:22.289\non the virtual infrastructure as well.\n\n292\n00:15:22.289 --> 00:15:25.151\nThe reality is that the normal\ndata that we're talking about,\n\n293\n00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:28.663\nnot the administrative and operational\ndata, but the data that the customer\n\n294\n00:15:28.663 --> 00:15:31.710\nis involved with and uses,\nit's created by the customer.\n\n295\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.240\nSo we actually control that.\n\n296\n00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.920\nBut with regards to storage, with\nregards to use, with regards to sharing,\n\n297\n00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.320\nwith regards to archiving, and\ncertainly with regards to destruction.\n\n298\n00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.702\nWe may have a partnership involved\nwith the cloud provider at some level,\n\n299\n00:15:45.702 --> 00:15:49.660\nto essentially drive the interaction\naround how we will consume,\n\n300\n00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.868\nhow we will use, how we will manage.\n\n301\n00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:56.471\nHow we will optimize and ultimately how\nwe will interact with that data over\n\n302\n00:15:56.471 --> 00:15:58.604\nthe period of time that it exists.\n\n303\n00:15:58.604 --> 00:16:00.809\nAnd because of that, because the data\nis not in our exclusive control.\n\n304\n00:16:00.809 --> 00:16:03.445\nThe way it is when we own\nthe infrastructure, and\n\n305\n00:16:03.445 --> 00:16:05.129\nit's essentially on-prem.\n\n306\n00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:06.227\nAs a result of that,\n\n307\n00:16:06.227 --> 00:16:10.106\nwe have to understand that we're\ngiving up a certain level of control,\n\n308\n00:16:10.106 --> 00:16:14.420\nwe must engender a certain level of trust\nbetween ourselves and the provider.\n\n309\n00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.380\nWe do this through\na variety of mechanisms.\n\n310\n00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.340\nWe've talked about hosting agreements,\nwe've talked about SLAs and\n\n311\n00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.020\nOLAs, surface level agreements,\noperational level agreements.\n\n312\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.500\nSomething you haven't\nheard me mention yet,\n\n313\n00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.410\nalthough we'll talk about it\nin upcoming episodes, a PLA.\n\n314\n00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.470\nYou know what a PLA is?\n\n315\n00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:30.820\nI do not know the PLA.\n\n316\n00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.923\nNeither do I, I was hoping you'd know.\n\n317\n00:16:31.923 --> 00:16:33.040\n[LAUGH] I don't know.\n\n318\n00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.150\nIf Megan knows, maybe,\nor somebody else knows.\n\n319\n00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.050\nBut she's shaking her head,\nshe doesn't know either.\n\n320\n00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.190\nSo, the PLA, I'm only kidding, of course.\n\n321\n00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.110\nThe PLA is the privacy level agreement,\nright?\n\n322\n00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.890\nAnd so the PLA, along with the SLA,\nthe Service Level Agreement, the OLA,\n\n323\n00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:48.960\nthe Operational Level Agreement, are all\nagreements that will become, in theory,\n\n324\n00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.130\ndepending on how this is done and\nthe kind of hosting agreement you have,\n\n325\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.110\npart of the hosting contracts or part of\nthe hosting agreements you will ultimately\n\n326\n00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.085\nas a customer sign and put in place\nwith your cloud service provider.\n\n327\n00:17:00.085 --> 00:17:03.465\nPLAs are becoming more and more common\ntoday in our industry in general.\n\n328\n00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:04.160\nThey're becoming more and\n\n329\n00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.210\nmore common especially with regards\nto the management of the privacy,\n\n330\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.690\nthe information management aspect of\ndata with regards to individuals.\n\n331\n00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.120\nCan we go back to the data life cycle?\n\n332\n00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.750\nWe actually wanna point something\nout here with regards to PLA.\n\n333\n00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.943\nSo when we think about creation, we think\nabout storage, use, share, archive, and\n\n334\n00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:23.860\ndestroy.\n\n335\n00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:29.000\nThe PLA would really take precedence over\neveryone of these areas of the life cycle,\n\n336\n00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.750\nwould have to help us to\nunderstand how to manage data\n\n337\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:35.970\nat every phase of this life cycle because\nwe have to worry about providing and\n\n338\n00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:39.010\nensuring confidentiality controls,\nintegrity controls,\n\n339\n00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:42.500\nand ultimately availability\ncontrols with regards to data.\n\n340\n00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:45.560\nSo imagine, for instance,\nyou mentioned that\n\n341\n00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.460\nspecifically it was an insurance company,\nright, that you had worked for.\n\n342\n00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:54.810\nAnd so, with regards to insurance,\nwhether it was home, life, auto, health,\n\n343\n00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.670\nwhatever kind of insurance it would be,\nregardless of what type of insurance or\n\n344\n00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.900\ninsurance products you may have offered,\nyou would have intellectual capital and\n\n345\n00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.360\ndata associated with each\nindividual customer, right.\n\n346\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.930\nSo, you'd have a customer record, you\nwould have information on that customer,\n\n347\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.360\nwhere they lived,\nprobably their birthdate,\n\n348\n00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.100\ntheir Social Security number most\nlikely in the United States.\n\n349\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.896\nYou may have had banking information\nabout them most likely cuz you would have\n\n350\n00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:19.313\ninformation about how they would pay, or\n\n351\n00:18:19.313 --> 00:18:21.580\na lot of people would set\nup auto pay typically.\n\n352\n00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.572\nSo they would take the money\nright out of their accounts.\n\n353\n00:18:23.572 --> 00:18:27.994\nYou would have information most likely on\nthe assets that they owned if you did that\n\n354\n00:18:27.994 --> 00:18:32.674\nkind of insurance, so a house, car, or\ncars, perhaps spouse, significant other,\n\n355\n00:18:32.674 --> 00:18:37.097\nchildren, that would be potentially down\nas people that may be covered on a policy\n\n356\n00:18:37.097 --> 00:18:39.180\nor maybe the beneficiary of a policy.\n\n357\n00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.330\nAnd you would have their\nSocial Security information,\n\n358\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.920\nright, and their additional identifiers,\nbirth dates,\n\n359\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.240\nmaiden names in the case of a spouse,\nif it was a woman, things like that.\n\n360\n00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:53.150\nWe have a lot of that data that\ncould become very important.\n\n361\n00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.040\nIt's very, very important for\nbusinesses to own.\n\n362\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.560\nBut ultimately, it's also very\nimportant to us as individuals.\n\n363\n00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.040\nAnd if that data was exposed, right,\nall sorts of bad things would happen.\n\n364\n00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.535\nAnd so we have to think about,\n\n365\n00:19:02.535 --> 00:19:06.716\nalthough you may not formally have had\nPLAs at the time, you had rules in place,\n\n366\n00:19:06.716 --> 00:19:09.330\nright, policies and\nprocedures that would govern the use,\n\n367\n00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:13.200\nthe storage, the access, and essentially\nthe data life cycle of that data.\n\n368\n00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.920\nAnd so the PLA is now being formalized,\nthe privacy level agreement is\n\n369\n00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.420\nessentially the distillation of\nthat thought process in the cloud,\n\n370\n00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.140\nand it's being formalized to\ngovern that entire life cycle.\n\n371\n00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.770\nIt's becoming very important for\nus to think about.\n\n372\n00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.970\nSo it's a newer way of interacting\nwith and dealing with data.\n\n373\n00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.660\nBut we do have to think about\nthe impact of some of this, right?\n\n374\n00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.320\nWhere do data security risks and\nconcerns come from?\n\n375\n00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.350\nIn the life cycle, we have risks and\n\n376\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.740\nconcerns in every phase\nof this life cycle.\n\n377\n00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.270\nThe chief information security officer,\nfor instance, if we have one of those, or\n\n378\n00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:47.130\nthe chief security officer, the CSO,\nCISO, they may have certain concerns and\n\n379\n00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:49.980\ncertain thoughts about things like\nwe just discussed, privacy and\n\n380\n00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.590\naccess to customer data.\n\n381\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.620\nAnd they're gonna insert, hopefully,\nif they do this the right way,\n\n382\n00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.280\nthey're gonna insert their concerns into\nthis data life cycle through policy and\n\n383\n00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:03.010\nultimately through the creation and\nthe use of things like PLAs, SLAs, and\n\n384\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:08.630\nOLAs to manage the data and to set the\nappropriate tone for use of data, right?\n\n385\n00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.160\nWhat about the CTO,\nthe Chief Technology, or CIO,\n\n386\n00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.460\nChief Information Officer, in a company?\n\n387\n00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.810\nThey most likely are gonna\nhave concerns as well.\n\n388\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:19.670\nThey may be concerned about security,\nbut they're probably gonna voice those\n\n389\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:22.679\nconcerns inside the general\ndiscussion at the C level suite.\n\n390\n00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:25.828\nAnd they may bubble up through\na C function, a CSO, CISO,\n\n391\n00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:30.137\netc, but they're gonna be more focused,\nmore concerned on the technology and\n\n392\n00:20:30.137 --> 00:20:33.260\nthe policies around the use\nof that technology, right.\n\n393\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.458\nThat's what they're gonna do.\n\n394\n00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:36.270\nSo they're gonna implement or\n\n395\n00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.050\nimprint their concerns on\ntop of this data life cycle.\n\n396\n00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:40.390\nWhat kind of technology?\n\n397\n00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.190\nAre we gonna use object level storage?\n\n398\n00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.060\nAre we gonna use volume level storage?\n\n399\n00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.080\nWhat are we gonna do there?\n\n400\n00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.008\nHow is that gonna work?\n\n401\n00:20:46.008 --> 00:20:51.240\nAre we gonna use web enabled APIs and\nfront ends that are authorized,\n\n402\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.970\nthat come through a vendor,\nare we gonna create our own?\n\n403\n00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.630\nIt's not just http and we're in,\nit's a question of restful APIs or\n\n404\n00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:00.930\nother kinds of APIs that may be used.\n\n405\n00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:03.450\nAre we gonna use proprietary technology?\n\n406\n00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.670\nAre we gonna use essentially\ntechnology that's available to anybody?\n\n407\n00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.360\nAre we gonna develop our own?\n\n408\n00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.110\nThese are things and\nquestions that CTOs, CIOs, those kind of\n\n409\n00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:14.880\nroles you're gonna struggle with,\nwith regards to data, and data management.\n\n410\n00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.690\nThink about the enterprise architect,\nright?\n\n411\n00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:22.030\nWe talked a lot about in one of our prior\nepisodes some of the different roles,\n\n412\n00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.420\nright, that we ultimately would see and\nenvision.\n\n413\n00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.200\nDo you have the graphic, can we\nthrow up the graphic real quick, for\n\n414\n00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.510\nthe roles that we were talking about?\n\n415\n00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:30.175\nI know it was multi-tabbed,\nand we had three, I think,\n\n416\n00:21:30.175 --> 00:21:31.197\nif I remember correctly, right?\n\n417\n00:21:31.197 --> 00:21:32.212\nYeah, there they are.\n\n418\n00:21:32.212 --> 00:21:33.210\nFor the different roles.\n\n419\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.197\nBut when we take a look at the roles,\nright, what we'll see,\n\n420\n00:21:36.197 --> 00:21:39.931\ncan we zoom in just so we can see them\ncuz I'm sure while somebody can see them,\n\n421\n00:21:39.931 --> 00:21:41.377\nmy eyesight is not that good.\n\n422\n00:21:41.377 --> 00:21:44.001\nYou'll see as you look\ndown towards the bottom,\n\n423\n00:21:44.001 --> 00:21:46.819\nwe have cloud administrator\nthere on the first one.\n\n424\n00:21:46.819 --> 00:21:47.963\nAnd we have, there we go,\n\n425\n00:21:47.963 --> 00:21:51.553\nwe have the cloud administrator if we go\nto the second tab, I know the architects,\n\n426\n00:21:51.553 --> 00:21:55.190\nI think, were on the second tab, if I\nremember correctly some of those roles.\n\n427\n00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.680\nSo we have the cloud architect\nwith the cloud data architect\n\n428\n00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.680\nwith the cloud application\narchitect up there.\n\n429\n00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.130\nIf we go to the third one, we will,\nthere we go [LAUGH], we will have,\n\n430\n00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.270\nI hate it when it does this,\nthat's why I don't auto hide mine.\n\n431\n00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:11.530\nWe will have the cloud storage\nadministrator, cloud service manager,\n\n432\n00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.770\nwe've got all these roles we defined\nin one of the prior episodes for you.\n\n433\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.250\nWhat you don't see up there, but what is\nalso kind of all encompassing that rolls\n\n434\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.850\nall that up is typically what's\ncalled an enterprise architect.\n\n435\n00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.850\nThe enterprise architect in traditional\nenvironments is gonna be that role that\n\n436\n00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:29.260\nis in charge of all this kind of stuff and\nenvisions in theory\n\n437\n00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:33.460\nwhat the design of the system will look\nlike all up for the entire enterprise.\n\n438\n00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.900\nWe're carving those roles up and\nspecifically saying hey, you might want\n\n439\n00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.900\nsomebody who's gonna do this or somebody\nwho's gonna do that with specificity.\n\n440\n00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.540\nSo that way,\nyou can assign that responsibility and\n\n441\n00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.050\nclearly see that element of\nthe design attributed to this role.\n\n442\n00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.670\nBut in most systems that are not\ncloud-based, we talked about an enterprise\n\n443\n00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:56.370\narchitect, we talked about an enterprise\nsecurity architecture, or an enterprise\n\n444\n00:22:56.370 --> 00:23:00.040\narchitecture from a management\nperspective, from a planning perspective.\n\n445\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.190\nAnd that role and/or the architecture,\nthe output that that role provides\n\n446\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:07.780\nis the blueprint,\nthe essential guiding documentation and\n\n447\n00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:12.580\ndesign thought process that encompasses\nall the issues and concerns we wanna\n\n448\n00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.590\naddress as we design and ultimately\noperate systems in the enterprise.\n\n449\n00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:19.755\nSo we have to think about that and\nwhat that role may say or these individual\n\n450\n00:23:19.755 --> 00:23:23.890\nsubcomponents of a role like that and\nwhat their take on data security is.\n\n451\n00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:27.440\nNetwork administration may have\nsomething to say about data security.\n\n452\n00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.150\nAverage users may have something\nto say about data security because\n\n453\n00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:34.550\ntheir take on security is not hey,\nI want my stuff to be secure.\n\n454\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:38.983\nWe know users want that, but their take\non security is more about availability of\n\n455\n00:23:38.983 --> 00:23:40.819\ndata and ability to do their job.\n\n456\n00:23:40.819 --> 00:23:43.554\nBecause if security gets in\nthe way of those things, or\n\n457\n00:23:43.554 --> 00:23:47.834\ncloud technology gets in the way of those\nthings, and doesn't act as an enabler, but\n\n458\n00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:51.896\nrather an inhibitor, then they're not\ngonna like security very much, right?\n\n459\n00:23:51.896 --> 00:23:55.378\nAnd they're gonna say, well,\nthat's not good, I need to do my job,\n\n460\n00:23:55.378 --> 00:23:58.638\nI can't be doing 25 things to\nvalidate who I am to then do my job.\n\n461\n00:23:58.638 --> 00:24:01.080\nIt's taking too long and\nthat's not going to work for me as a user.\n\n462\n00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.204\nSo, there's all these different\ncompetitive voices and\n\n463\n00:24:04.204 --> 00:24:08.029\nconcerns that sit in theory around\nthis mythical table that we call data\n\n464\n00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:09.940\nsecurity that we have to account for\n\n465\n00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.270\nand we have to think about as we start\nour discussions in this particular area.\n\n466\n00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:19.560\nSo as we think about cloud data security,\nwhat we have to do is really pay attention\n\n467\n00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.310\nto all the little voices running\naround in the organization,\n\n468\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.890\nall the voices in our head that are gonna\ntell us that there are things that we\n\n469\n00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:29.640\nas the CCSP have to be concerned with.\n\n470\n00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.868\nAnd we have to be willing to have\na dialog with them and say okay, so\n\n471\n00:24:32.868 --> 00:24:36.866\nyou've thought about these things Mr.\nor Mrs. cloud architect, Mr. or Mrs.\n\n472\n00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:39.930\nstorage admin, Mr. or Mrs.\nenterprise architect.\n\n473\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:42.990\nBut what about the other things that\nare on my list that nobody's said or\n\n474\n00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.460\nnobody's talked about yet,\nlet's have a dialogue.\n\n475\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.620\nAnd what I try to talk to my customers,\nmy students, about in this area is really,\n\n476\n00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:53.480\nwho are you talking to and what are you\nsaying when you talk about the cloud?\n\n477\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.160\nInternally, right?\n\n478\n00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.455\nIt's the internal dialogue.\n\n479\n00:24:55.455 --> 00:24:59.522\nAnd when I say the internal dialogue, what\nI mean is inside the company what does\n\n480\n00:24:59.522 --> 00:25:03.287\nthe driver for a cloud look like,\nwho's in charge, what are the business\n\n481\n00:25:03.287 --> 00:25:07.561\nrequirements, what are the concerns we're\naddressing, why are we doing cloud?\n\n482\n00:25:07.561 --> 00:25:11.161\nIf we don't have answers to these\nquestions and cloud is just something\n\n483\n00:25:11.161 --> 00:25:15.241\nwe're doing because in theory it was a\ngood idea, we had some money laying around\n\n484\n00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:19.279\nand nobody else had a better idea so this\nis what we're doing, that may be okay.\n\n485\n00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.559\nThat may be the reason we're doing it,\njust because we're bored.\n\n486\n00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:24.818\nBut the reality is,\nyou should have a better reason than that.\n\n487\n00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:26.189\nThere should be a business requirement.\n\n488\n00:25:26.189 --> 00:25:30.823\nThere should be a value statement\nassigned to that requirement, right?\n\n489\n00:25:30.823 --> 00:25:34.034\nStanley, when you get done working\nduring the day, like you and\n\n490\n00:25:34.034 --> 00:25:36.471\nI are doing now we take break and\nyou're hungry,\n\n491\n00:25:36.471 --> 00:25:39.405\nyou typically go get something\nto eat more often than not.\n\n492\n00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:41.575\nYou may brings something,\nyou may go out and get something, so\n\n493\n00:25:41.575 --> 00:25:44.075\ndo you usually go and\nget the same thing every day?\n\n494\n00:25:44.075 --> 00:25:45.632\n>> No.\nNo I usually change it up,\n\n495\n00:25:45.632 --> 00:25:46.982\nI like to have different foods.\n\n496\n00:25:46.982 --> 00:25:48.863\n>> Okay so why do you change it up?\n\n497\n00:25:48.863 --> 00:25:50.012\n>> For variety.\n\n498\n00:25:50.012 --> 00:25:50.674\n>> For variety.\n\n499\n00:25:50.674 --> 00:25:52.903\nOkay, so variety's important, right?\n\n500\n00:25:52.903 --> 00:25:56.142\nBut do we have variety in the cloud?\n\n501\n00:25:56.142 --> 00:25:57.233\n>> Yes and no.\n\n502\n00:25:57.233 --> 00:25:58.080\n>> Yes and no.\n\n503\n00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.357\nOkay, so what would be the yes part?\n\n504\n00:26:00.357 --> 00:26:07.999\n>> The yes is, we have variety in the way\nthat we can, we have IAAS and IS PAS.\n\n505\n00:26:07.999 --> 00:26:10.599\nSo those are different,\neven though similar.\n\n506\n00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:13.669\nWe have variety in that we can\neither use a Linux platform or\n\n507\n00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:17.254\na Windows platform, we can be doing\nall sorts of different things.\n\n508\n00:26:17.254 --> 00:26:20.957\nBut in the no, as far as variety is,\nit's all in the cloud,\n\n509\n00:26:20.957 --> 00:26:23.043\nit's all one encompassed area.\n\n510\n00:26:23.043 --> 00:26:27.319\nYou're putting it offsite not onsite,\nand therefore, that's not the variety.\n\n511\n00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.500\n>> But are we always putting\nit offsite and not onsite?\n\n512\n00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.950\n>> I guess not,\nwe are private cloud, then yeah.\n\n513\n00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.920\n>> So it's not always offsite, although\nto Daniel's point, majority of the time,\n\n514\n00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:38.260\nit can be, certainly, and\nthere is a lot of variety.\n\n515\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.199\nThere's different servers models,\nIS PASS and SAS.\n\n516\n00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:42.801\nDifferent deployment models, right?\n\n517\n00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:45.918\nThat Daniel kind of went through although\nhe didn't name them formally but\n\n518\n00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:49.094\nhe mentioned the idea; public,\nprivate, hybrid, and community cloud.\n\n519\n00:26:49.094 --> 00:26:52.171\nSo, we've got a lot of differences,\na lot of variety.\n\n520\n00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:54.548\nBut at the same time,\nwe have a lot of sameness.\n\n521\n00:26:54.548 --> 00:26:58.175\nAll the data, as Daniel said, is in\nthe cloud whether the cloud is on prem.\n\n522\n00:26:58.175 --> 00:26:59.371\nwhether it's off prem.\n\n523\n00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:02.158\nWhether it's managed by a third party,\nmanaged by us.\n\n524\n00:27:02.158 --> 00:27:07.519\nWhether we jointly share responsibility or\nindividually control aspects of it.\n\n525\n00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:08.800\nIt is still the cloud.\n\n526\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.210\nAnd we have to think about this concept as\nwe begin to talk about what's important to\n\n527\n00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.809\nthe organization and understand\nwhether cloud is relevant for us.\n\n528\n00:27:16.809 --> 00:27:21.077\nI can think of several customers, although\nnot many, that have made the decision that\n\n529\n00:27:21.077 --> 00:27:24.759\nthe cloud is just not appropriate for\nthem based on their business model and\n\n530\n00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:27.586\nbased on their customers and\nwhere their customers are.\n\n531\n00:27:27.586 --> 00:27:31.978\nAnd their customers concerns about\ndata security and about the needs for\n\n532\n00:27:31.978 --> 00:27:36.806\nthe organization, the business,\nthe enterprise to address their concerns.\n\n533\n00:27:36.806 --> 00:27:40.333\n>> Adam, really quickly,\nyou brought that up and it made me think.\n\n534\n00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:46.673\nIs it, I guess that's the big question,\nis the cloud a less secure solution,\n\n535\n00:27:46.673 --> 00:27:50.623\nby and large,\nthan traditional enterprise IT.\n\n536\n00:27:52.584 --> 00:27:54.082\nNot really a question\nwe can answer easily.\n\n537\n00:27:54.082 --> 00:27:56.323\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a much broader conversation.\n\n538\n00:27:56.323 --> 00:27:57.228\n>> Three is oddball.\n\n539\n00:27:57.228 --> 00:28:00.315\n[LAUGH]\n>> The entire discussion we're having,\n\n540\n00:28:00.315 --> 00:28:04.140\nright, the entire series of episodes\nwe're ultimately going to create and\n\n541\n00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.828\nall the shows we're going\nto do with regards to CCSP,\n\n542\n00:28:06.828 --> 00:28:10.254\ntaken collectively, will still\nnot answer that question easily.\n\n543\n00:28:10.254 --> 00:28:12.577\nBecause the problem is that,\nultimately, and\n\n544\n00:28:12.577 --> 00:28:16.524\nwe get asked these questions all the time,\npeople will say to me as a consultant,\n\n545\n00:28:16.524 --> 00:28:20.473\nwill say to me as a trainer, they'll say\nto me as a cloud security professional,\n\n546\n00:28:20.473 --> 00:28:22.240\nhey, do you think cloud is secure?\n\n547\n00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.366\nCan I trust the cloud?\n\n548\n00:28:23.366 --> 00:28:24.040\nCan I go to it?\n\n549\n00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.350\nIs it more or less secure than\neverything else I already do?\n\n550\n00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.240\nAnd the answer is, it depends, and\npeople hate to hear that answer.\n\n551\n00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.770\nI hate to give it to them,\nbut it's the real answer.\n\n552\n00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:35.458\nIt depends.\nWe put a big asterisk next to that because\n\n553\n00:28:35.458 --> 00:28:39.657\nultimately, what you gotta do is figure\nout all the answers to all the little\n\n554\n00:28:39.657 --> 00:28:43.264\nquestions that create the context\nof what the cloud, kind of what\n\n555\n00:28:43.264 --> 00:28:47.812\nI've been talking about and leading up to,\nwhich is what is the business driver?\n\n556\n00:28:47.812 --> 00:28:48.695\nWhat are the requirements?\n\n557\n00:28:48.695 --> 00:28:51.492\nWhat are the concerns we're\ntrying to address with the cloud?\n\n558\n00:28:51.492 --> 00:28:54.674\nIf you tell me you want to be in the cloud\nbecause everybody else is doing it and\n\n559\n00:28:54.674 --> 00:28:56.413\nyou don't want to be left out in the cold,\n\n560\n00:28:56.413 --> 00:28:58.480\nthen it's probably not a good solution for\nyou.\n\n561\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:02.580\nYou're probably not gonna pay attention to\nit and care and feed for it the right way,\n\n562\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.278\nand it will probably be less secure\nbecause you're not gonna invest the time\n\n563\n00:29:06.278 --> 00:29:08.154\nand resources to make it more secure.\n\n564\n00:29:08.154 --> 00:29:09.878\nIf you tell me, on the other hand,\n\n565\n00:29:09.878 --> 00:29:13.741\nthat you're gonna go to the cloud because\nyou've got this new application or\n\n566\n00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:16.594\nan idea for a service,\nwhatever may be driving that, but\n\n567\n00:29:16.594 --> 00:29:20.577\nultimately you want to produce some sort\nof thing that customers can consume and\n\n568\n00:29:20.577 --> 00:29:24.262\nyou've got this innovative new idea\nyou want to use the cloud to drive, to\n\n569\n00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:28.670\ninteract with customers and you see value\nbeing derived from that for the business.\n\n570\n00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.870\nYou're going to make investments to\nensure that that is going to be secure,\n\n571\n00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.770\nthat it's gonna be optimized,\nthe customer's gonna be able to take\n\n572\n00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.936\nadvantage of that, at least you\nnormally would, as a business, anyway.\n\n573\n00:29:37.936 --> 00:29:41.714\nAnd as a result, I would say that on\naverage, it would probably be as secure,\n\n574\n00:29:41.714 --> 00:29:45.669\nand perhaps even more secure, because\nyou're going to invest significantly in\n\n575\n00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:48.365\norder to make sure it is\nultimately designed that way.\n\n576\n00:29:48.365 --> 00:29:50.223\nIn other words,\nit's really a matter of context.\n\n577\n00:29:50.223 --> 00:29:54.789\nWhile it's easy to say, there is no\neasy answer, the reality is, there isn't\n\n578\n00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:59.308\nan easy answer because there's so\nmany variables that go into that question.\n\n579\n00:29:59.308 --> 00:30:03.638\nCall it a loaded question, it's not a\nsoftball, it's a nuclear bomb that Daniel\n\n580\n00:30:03.638 --> 00:30:06.798\nthrew up in the air and\nbasically dared me to hit and set off.\n\n581\n00:30:06.798 --> 00:30:07.414\nRight?\n\n582\n00:30:07.414 --> 00:30:11.177\nAnd so the reality is that\nwe see this all the time.\n\n583\n00:30:11.177 --> 00:30:13.535\nBusinesses don't do a good job.\n\n584\n00:30:13.535 --> 00:30:17.105\nPeople don't do a good job of\nunderstanding something fundamental,\n\n585\n00:30:17.105 --> 00:30:19.954\nsomething critical,\nto our ability to be successful.\n\n586\n00:30:19.954 --> 00:30:23.452\nAnd not just in the cloud by the way, but\nin almost anything we do with regards to\n\n587\n00:30:23.452 --> 00:30:25.682\nsecurity, and\nthat would be root cause, right?\n\n588\n00:30:25.682 --> 00:30:27.442\nIf we think about answering the question,\n\n589\n00:30:27.442 --> 00:30:31.122\nwhy, which is essentially related\nultimately, right, to root cause.\n\n590\n00:30:31.122 --> 00:30:35.120\nYou get to root cause by\nasking by asking why.\n\n591\n00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.992\nAnd so if we ask why are we going to\nthe cloud and we get the first answer,\n\n592\n00:30:37.992 --> 00:30:40.209\nwell because all of our\ncompetitors are in the cloud.\n\n593\n00:30:40.209 --> 00:30:43.686\nOkay, Daniel, great first answer, let's\ngo back to that well again cuz that's not\n\n594\n00:30:43.686 --> 00:30:45.733\nreally the bedrock,\nthat's not the root cause.\n\n595\n00:30:45.733 --> 00:30:48.333\nThat's you giving me a reason\nthat doesn't really matter but\n\n596\n00:30:48.333 --> 00:30:50.838\nyou're convincing yourself\nthat's what's important.\n\n597\n00:30:50.838 --> 00:30:52.370\nSo let's ask again, so Daniel,\n\n598\n00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.953\nwhat's really the reason\nbehind us going to the cloud?\n\n599\n00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:57.734\nNot just cuz our competitors are there,\nthat is important by the way,\n\n600\n00:30:57.734 --> 00:30:59.116\nI don't wanna make light of that.\n\n601\n00:30:59.116 --> 00:31:03.310\nBusinesses have to stay relevant to their\ncustomer base and if everybody else in\n\n602\n00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:07.379\ntheir industry, essentially gone to\nthe cloud, we have to think about being\n\n603\n00:31:07.379 --> 00:31:11.008\nthere as well or we have to be prepared\nto stand alone off to the side and\n\n604\n00:31:11.008 --> 00:31:14.927\noffer value to our customers that they\ncould perceive in a different way.\n\n605\n00:31:14.927 --> 00:31:17.976\nAnd there may be an advantage in that, but\nthere also may be a detriment to that.\n\n606\n00:31:17.976 --> 00:31:20.300\nAnd we have to really\nweigh those concerns.\n\n607\n00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.010\nBut there's gotta be more to\nthat conversation than just,\n\n608\n00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.590\nour competitors are there,\nso we're going there too.\n\n609\n00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:27.055\nOkay, so Daniel,\nwhat's the next level down?\n\n610\n00:31:27.055 --> 00:31:29.090\nYou know we would go\nthrough this iteratively.\n\n611\n00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.802\nEventually, hopefully, with the proper\namount of introspection, coaching,\n\n612\n00:31:33.802 --> 00:31:38.716\ndialogue, and sifting through the answers,\nDaniel and I would get to what we think is\n\n613\n00:31:38.716 --> 00:31:43.110\nprobably root cause around why his\nbusiness may be interested in the cloud.\n\n614\n00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:47.282\nWhen we get to that, we can then really\nstart to assess, through things like BIA,\n\n615\n00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:51.698\nBusiness Impact Assessment or Business\nImpact Analysis, through risk management,\n\n616\n00:31:51.698 --> 00:31:54.850\nthrough vulnerability assessments,\nthrough PEN testing.\n\n617\n00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:59.788\nThrough policy process procedure,\nthrough CBA, Cost Benefit Analysis,\n\n618\n00:31:59.788 --> 00:32:04.800\nthrough all the things we gotta do,\nall the iterations we have to go through,\n\n619\n00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.043\nall of the stuff that as CCSPs, we should\nbe trained to do, we should know how to do\n\n620\n00:32:10.043 --> 00:32:15.443\nand we should be willing to do in order to\nhelp a customer understand the true value,\n\n621\n00:32:15.443 --> 00:32:20.190\nthe true possibilities, and\nthe true risks associated with cloud.\n\n622\n00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.150\nWe can then begin to answer that\nquestion and say well it may or\n\n623\n00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.910\nmay not be as secure,\nit may be more secure.\n\n624\n00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.760\nI have a lot of customers in the cloud\nthat have been able to architect solutions\n\n625\n00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.080\nthat are as strong, as secure, and\nindeed in many respects more secure and\n\n626\n00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.730\nstronger than they would have been if\nthey continued to manage them on-prem.\n\n627\n00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.700\nAnd one of the main reasons\nthat they are more secure\n\n628\n00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.600\nis not because they've come up with this\nradical new way of doing access control,\n\n629\n00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.660\nthis radical new way of encrypting.\n\n630\n00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.840\nEncryption is essentially encryption,\nwhether it's in the Cloud or not.\n\n631\n00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.990\nWe don't invent new algorithms\nthat are Cloud-specific\n\n632\n00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:53.810\nto do encryption in most cases.\n\n633\n00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.860\nThere are proprietary implementations\nunique to the cloud, but\n\n634\n00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.070\nif you take those off the table and you\njust talk about generic encryption, AES,\n\n635\n00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:03.800\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard\nalgorithm,\n\n636\n00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.430\nwhat we commonly refer to as Rijndael,\nthe algorithm behind AES.\n\n637\n00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:10.150\nAES is AES,\nwhether you implement it in the cloud or\n\n638\n00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:12.740\nyou implement it on-prem in\nphysical hardware you own.\n\n639\n00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.280\nIt's still the same algorithm.\n\n640\n00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.330\nThe RSA algorithm is identical whether\nyou use it in the cloud or not.\n\n641\n00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:20.400\nTriple desk is identical right,\nhashing is the same\n\n642\n00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.120\nwhether we do it through the cloud or\nwe do it on prem on a local system.\n\n643\n00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.850\nSo an MD5 hash is 128 bits\nregardless of where it comes from.\n\n644\n00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.340\nSo my point is that those\nthings don't change.\n\n645\n00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:35.940\nWhat changes instead, is the ability of\nthe customer to create better process,\n\n646\n00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.740\nto be more focused on risk management,\nand as a result of that,\n\n647\n00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.810\nto essentially tighten up the elements\nthat may be lagging a little bit.\n\n648\n00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.900\nBecause they've gotten comfortable\nusing technology that they own,\n\n649\n00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.910\nwe'll put those in air quotes that they\nown, and they're responsible for and so\n\n650\n00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.540\nthey don't pay as much attention to it.\n\n651\n00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:53.410\nWell, it's running there.\n\n652\n00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.920\nYou know it's kind of secure.\n\n653\n00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.740\nDaniel and\nhis team are keeping an eye on it.\n\n654\n00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.680\nWe're pretty confident they're\ngoing to do a good job and\n\n655\n00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.600\nthey're going to tell us\nwhat we have to do, right?\n\n656\n00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.930\nSo as a result we may not\npay as much attention to is,\n\n657\n00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:05.960\nand because of that it\nmay not be as secure.\n\n658\n00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:10.130\nIn the cloud because we have to\ngive away some of that oversight,\n\n659\n00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:12.070\ngive away some of that control, and\n\n660\n00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:16.420\nwe have to learn to trust which is\na big deal, right, for most of us.\n\n661\n00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.440\nSo because of that we're gonna be hyper\nfocused at least if we do this the right\n\n662\n00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:23.710\nway on creating that trust and\nunderstanding what the extent of\n\n663\n00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:27.310\nthat trust is and how to manage and\nbe successful within that relationship.\n\n664\n00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.185\nWe're gonna be essentially,\nif we do this the right way,\n\n665\n00:34:30.185 --> 00:34:33.345\nfocused on making sure we do the stuff\nthat we have to do as customers and\n\n666\n00:34:33.345 --> 00:34:37.145\nwe hold accountable our cloud provider to\ndo the stuff that they're supposed to do.\n\n667\n00:34:37.145 --> 00:34:40.585\nSo that way between the two of us we're\ncreating a more secure environment.\n\n668\n00:34:40.585 --> 00:34:45.115\nAnd so if we're smart we can answer that\nquestion appropriately with an answer that\n\n669\n00:34:45.115 --> 00:34:48.945\ntypically implies that we could be\nat least as if not more secure.\n\n670\n00:34:48.945 --> 00:34:51.115\nBut it's about vigilance,\nit's ultimately about oversight,\n\n671\n00:34:51.115 --> 00:34:53.370\nit's about risk management and\nrisk awareness.\n\n672\n00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.070\nAnd that's not always easy, and so\n\n673\n00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.500\nit's a very hard question to\nanswer more often than not, right.\n\n674\n00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.900\nSince we talk about the data life cycle\nand the phases as we set the tone for\n\n675\n00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.040\ncloud data security conversations\nin upcoming episodes,\n\n676\n00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.350\nwe want to keep in mind all the different\nareas of the data lifecycle,\n\n677\n00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.300\nall the things that we've talked about\nthat has to be or have to be addressed.\n\n678\n00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:18.470\nRoot cause, risk management, individual\nphases of activity that may overlap or\n\n679\n00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.000\nmay be unique with regards\nto data management.\n\n680\n00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.660\nThe concerns that all the different actors\nwill have with regards to data, data\n\n681\n00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.200\naccess, data technology, data control,\nthese are questions, these are things,\n\n682\n00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.910\nthese are Thebes that will\ncontinuously come back up not just for\n\n683\n00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:37.535\nthe CCSP But, in general, for\nanybody that deals with cloud.\n\n684\n00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:41.955\nAn average user in the cloud doesn't think\nmuch about where their data is, doesn't\n\n685\n00:35:41.955 --> 00:35:46.355\nthink much about what it takes to secure\ndata on information work or in normal use.\n\n686\n00:35:46.355 --> 00:35:50.042\nAn IT professional probably\nthinks a lot about that stuff and\n\n687\n00:35:50.042 --> 00:35:54.092\nhas as a result a much broader picture\nof the kind of concerns we have.\n\n688\n00:35:54.092 --> 00:35:57.952\nBut the reality is, for every IT\nprofessional that uses the cloud, we have\n\n689\n00:35:57.952 --> 00:36:02.072\nhundreds of thousands of individual users\nthat don't have that perspective, and\n\n690\n00:36:02.072 --> 00:36:04.622\nit's not their job by the way\nto have that perspective.\n\n691\n00:36:04.622 --> 00:36:08.772\nIt's their job to consume cloud data and\nuse cloud services and to do so\n\n692\n00:36:08.772 --> 00:36:12.630\nunder the direction and guidance of the\narchitectures that as cloud professors and\n\n693\n00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:17.160\nsecurity focus, security minded\nIT individuals, we provide.\n\n694\n00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:22.270\nIf we do our job the right way at CCSPs,\nif we are focused on security,\n\n695\n00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:26.140\nif we identify and manage risk then\nthe average user goes about their daily\n\n696\n00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:30.210\nlife and doesn't see or interact with or\nunderstand all the bad things that\n\n697\n00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:33.460\nare lurking out in the shadows,\nbecause it's our job to keep them away.\n\n698\n00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.710\nBut if we don't do our job, they're gonna\nessentially wind up in the same place at\n\n699\n00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:42.270\nthe same time, and when users and bad\nactors collide, we essentially have risk.\n\n700\n00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.410\nRisk is realized, and ultimately as\na result, we wind up talking about things\n\n701\n00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:49.180\nlike breaches, we wind up talking about\nexposure, we wind up talking about\n\n702\n00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:52.630\nlawsuits or all the things that go into\nthat, right, whatever that may be.\n\n703\n00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:56.750\nYou wind up on the evening news and\nyou know you are the subject of the expose\n\n704\n00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.560\nthat comes out about why data breaches\nare continuing to happen, right?\n\n705\n00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.840\nOr whatever that case may be.\n\n706\n00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.300\nSo we don't want that to happen, right?\n\n707\n00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.100\nYou don't wanna be that guy or\nthat girl because that's bad.\n\n708\n00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:09.160\nAs a CCSP, as any security professional,\nit's our job to act with due care and\n\n709\n00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.030\ndue diligence.\n\n710\n00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:13.690\nIt's our job to ensure it's the best\nof our abilities that we identify and\n\n711\n00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:17.130\nmanage all the risk that we can, be\naware of that in a given moment in time.\n\n712\n00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.710\nThere's always risk that's unidentified,\nunknown, unforeseen, and\n\n713\n00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:24.310\nwe have to be prepared to deal with\nthe unforeseen but we have to understand\n\n714\n00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:27.380\nhow to manage the things we know,\nwe understand, and we are aware of.\n\n715\n00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.020\nAnd all these things go into that softball\nquestion you threw up in the air, right,\n\n716\n00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.000\nthat was so easy to answer but\nindeed, it's so rich, so complex, so\n\n717\n00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.690\nconvoluted, that it's really not so\neasy to answer.\n\n718\n00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.880\nYou need to really paint\nthe much broader picture, and\n\n719\n00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.050\na much finer granular\ndiscussion has to happen\n\n720\n00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:45.160\nto really understand the answer\nto a question like that.\n\n721\n00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.550\n>> And\nI really appreciate your answer to that.\n\n722\n00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:49.780\nI mean to be honest with you, I did kinda\nput that out there facetiously for you,\n\n723\n00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.080\nbecause a lot of times it\nseems like our CIO's and\n\n724\n00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:56.680\nthings, they want to have a yes or no.\n\n725\n00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:57.200\nIs this good?\n\n726\n00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.580\nThey wanna quantify it.\n\n727\n00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.040\nAnd that's not easily done.\n\n728\n00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.160\nYou did a great job of explaining\nwhy we need to do things like CCSP.\n\n729\n00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.160\nWe need to get those certifications so\nwe can understand what it does take\n\n730\n00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.290\nto secure a cloud environment for\nour specific environment.\n\n731\n00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:13.420\nIs that going to work?\n\n732\n00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.430\nAre we able to do that,\nmake it more secure.\n\n733\n00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:18.980\nAnd that's our goal and we do appreciate\nyou helping us out with that.\n\n734\n00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.790\nBut looking at that clock, men it has\nticked it's last time for this episode.\n\n735\n00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:26.530\nAdam thanks so much for joining us today\nand explain some of these concepts.\n\n736\n00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.600\nWe thank you guys for joining us as well,\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\n\n737\n00:38:29.600 -->

ITPROTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowry and in today's\nepisode, we are continuing forward with\n\n4\n00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.150\nour certified Cloud security\nprofessional series.\n\n5\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.660\nAnd the sherpa joining us today\nto help us climb that Everest\n\n6\n00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.490\nis none other than our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.450\nAdam, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.270\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.390\n>> I don't know how to say good morning\nin sherpa-ese, so I will just say hello,\n\n10\n00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.080\nhow are you?\n\n11\n00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.200\nAnd we'll go with that.\n\n12\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.260\nI'm a sherpa.\nI've been promoted.\n\n13\n00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.940\nThat's awesome.\n\n14\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.600\nI always wanted to be one.\n\n15\n00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.630\nI thought I was too short.\n\n16\n00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.910\nBut I guess I'm not.\n\n17\n00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.870\nSo, outstanding, very cool.\n\n18\n00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.610\nSo let's go climb some mountains and\ntalk about the cloud.\n\n19\n00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.990\nWe've been talking a lot about, not just\nthe general thought process of data,\n\n20\n00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.190\nbut cloud based data, and\n\n21\n00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.160\nhow cloud based data is very similar,\nbut also in some cases very different\n\n22\n00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.460\nwith regards to the approaches we have to\ntake to really understand the context.\n\n23\n00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.380\nOf how to manage data in the cloud.\n\n24\n00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.030\nAnd we wanna continue that conversation\nin this particular episode\n\n25\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.070\nby starting to think about location and\naccess.\n\n26\n00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.840\nThese are themes that\nbecome very important for\n\n27\n00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.370\nus, for guards to cloud base,\n\n28\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.270\ndata cloud base, anything really if you\nhave to think about location and access.\n\n29\n00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.290\nBut especially cloud base data.\n\n30\n00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.610\nWhere are we coming from,\nhow are we gonna get there?\n\n31\n00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.890\nWhat are we gonna have to do when\nwe arrive to validate who we are.\n\n32\n00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.200\nIt's really what location and\naccess are all about.\n\n33\n00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.270\nWhere data is certainly Is\ngoing to be important to us,\n\n34\n00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.970\nwe have to think about where data\nis in relation to where we are and\n\n35\n00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.720\nif we can get to that data and\nif so under what conditions and\n\n36\n00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.310\nwith what technology and with what level\nof access what would be able to arrive and\n\n37\n00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.460\nas your Sherpa I have to warn you\nthat the journey may be rocky, right?\n\n38\n00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.480\nAnd maybe bumpy.\n\n39\n00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.590\nWe may not be able to get\nthere in a straight path.\n\n40\n00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.420\nmay have to follow some sort of convoluted\nway to travel to the data because\n\n41\n00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.610\nnot everything may be as simple as it\nwould be if we owned the system directly.\n\n42\n00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.800\nAnd this is one of the things\nwe have to think about,\n\n43\n00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.780\ngiving control of our data through a SASS,\na PASS and or\n\n44\n00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.690\nan IASS model at some level,\nmaybe not the data itself, but\n\n45\n00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.440\nthe infrastructure the data runs on or\nshared responsibilityfor provisioning and\n\n46\n00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.290\nmanaging of that infrastructure\nstructure is handed over\n\n47\n00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.970\nto a cloud service provider as part of the\nagreement essentially to run on the Cloud.\n\n48\n00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.690\nAnd as a result of that if we are\ncolocating and hosting on the Cloud and\n\n49\n00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.150\nwe're not owning the Cloud\ninfrastructure ourselves on prem for\n\n50\n00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.090\na private on prem cloud that we maintain\nas IT and we control top to bottom.\n\n51\n00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.080\nWe have to negotiate essentially, what the\nrequirements will be around data access,\n\n52\n00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.830\nwe have to think about that, right?\n\n53\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.070\nAnd so, when I go and\nI do work for government and or\n\n54\n00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.110\nmilitary organizations, and\nI do a fair amount of work for\n\n55\n00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.740\nthem around the world I have to go\nthrough a fairly rigorous process\n\n56\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.490\nof background checking of security,\nto ensure that if I do go on base, and\n\n57\n00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.420\nI do spend a lot of time on bases, doing\ntraining, that I'm not going to present.\n\n58\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.050\nIn any way a security liability for the\npeople that are sponsoring me to be there.\n\n59\n00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.340\nI'm not typically allowed to bring\na device like a laptop or a phone.\n\n60\n00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.150\nUsually those are left in\nsome sort of secure area.\n\n61\n00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.480\nIn one case recently way I had to do\nsome training for one of the secure\n\n62\n00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.830\nlocations that I regularly spend time with\nand they're involved in intelligence.\n\n63\n00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.680\nAnd so as a result you're not only not\nallowed to bring in laptops and phones and\n\n64\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.990\nthings like that, but\n\n65\n00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.780\nyou're not allowed to bring in any\nkind of removable storage device.\n\n66\n00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.200\nSo I can't bring in a USB drive or\nI can't bring in any kind of media\n\n67\n00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.310\neven if it was burnt onto a CD rom or\na floppy disk or\n\n68\n00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.350\nanything like that I wouldn't be able to\nbring it past security because they will\n\n69\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.800\nnot allow external items to be brought in,\ntypically, under very rare conditions.\n\n70\n00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.330\nAnd it's a very rigorous process to\ngo through to get cleared to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.915\nI had a challenge because\nI had to go in this.\n\n72\n00:03:41.915 --> 00:03:43.695\nEssentially do some consulting and\n\n73\n00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:47.455\ndo some sort of knowledge\ntransfer train a group of\n\n74\n00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:51.475\npeople that were going to be administering\nand setting up systems in order to be able\n\n75\n00:03:51.475 --> 00:03:55.072\nto essentially figure out how to do that I\nhad to have some materials with With me.\n\n76\n00:03:55.072 --> 00:03:59.402\nAnd so I had to bring in whitepapers and\nvarious things that we would need,\n\n77\n00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:00.222\ntemplates, etc.\n\n78\n00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:03.472\nBut the problem was I couldn't\nbring them in physically and\n\n79\n00:04:03.472 --> 00:04:06.332\nI couldn't access them through the Cloud\nbecause of the secured networks we\n\n80\n00:04:06.332 --> 00:04:09.002\nwould be working on and\nthe secure locations we were in.\n\n81\n00:04:09.002 --> 00:04:12.002\nThere was no direct external\naccess outside to the Internet,\n\n82\n00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.832\nat least not the sites like Dropbox or\n\n83\n00:04:13.832 --> 00:04:17.320\nSkyDrive or any of those places\nyou would normally put that data.\n\n84\n00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.670\nYou could get to certain sites but not\nto ones that would essentially allow me\n\n85\n00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.520\nto download unrestricted any kind of file.\n\n86\n00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.310\n>> Adam, that's basically how Stuxnet got\nin to the Iranian nuclear facility is\n\n87\n00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.985\nsomeone picked up a copy of\nit out in the parking lot and\n\n88\n00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:32.005\n>> Brought it in via USB key I think and\n\n89\n00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:34.285\nthat's how they got in\nto their SCATA systems.\n\n90\n00:04:34.285 --> 00:04:39.095\n>> I don't know that it was necessarily\nwhat we would call a baiting attack,\n\n91\n00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:42.185\nwhich is essentially you leave\na thumb drive on the ground, or\n\n92\n00:04:42.185 --> 00:04:45.065\nsomething like that,\nsomebody picks it up and walks it through.\n\n93\n00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:49.005\nI've heard varying stories about how\nStuxnet ultimately- and Duqu and Flame and\n\n94\n00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:52.335\nsome of these other malware-\nstate sponsored malware items,\n\n95\n00:04:52.335 --> 00:04:53.820\nwere ultimately delivered.\n\n96\n00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.940\nOne of them was delivered through\nessentially a certificate spoof where\n\n97\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.060\nthe origination and the digital signature\nassociated with that certificate were made\n\n98\n00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.190\nto look like it was coming from a\nlegitimate third party security vendor, or\n\n99\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.670\nsoftware vendor, that was then used to\n\n100\n00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.510\nessentially infiltrate the system under\nthe guise of authorized packages or\n\n101\n00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.640\ndownloads, so there's different\nways this stuff can be delivered.\n\n102\n00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.340\nI'm not necessarily familiar with the one\nabout stuffs not being delivered through\n\n103\n00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.770\na USB drive out in the parking lot,\nit very well may have happened that way.\n\n104\n00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.760\nBut any of these kinds\nof things could occur.\n\n105\n00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.365\nAnd so it's very, very difficult to deal\nwith location And access control in some\n\n106\n00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:32.965\nof these systems because you want to\nuse the cloud to pull data in and\n\n107\n00:05:32.965 --> 00:05:36.535\nthe perimeter the on clay boundary is\nessentially saying sorry the cloud doesn't\n\n108\n00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:39.655\nexist here right no Cloud or\nCloud in very limited circumstances.\n\n109\n00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:44.775\nSo location and access who can access\nit from where under what conditions.\n\n110\n00:05:44.775 --> 00:05:46.165\nThese are things we've gotta think about.\n\n111\n00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:49.725\nWe've gotta be aware of and\nas CCSPs we have to contend with.\n\n112\n00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:53.480\nIt took me basically about\nan hour to go through a security\n\n113\n00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.660\nthought process with the IA,\nthe information assurance function\n\n114\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.570\nat that base to negotiate how I would\nbe able to bring this material in.\n\n115\n00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.780\nAnd it was a fairly involved process.\n\n116\n00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.340\nIt involved going up the chain\nof command several levels.\n\n117\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.060\nGetting clearance to essentially ask\nthem to take on an IA function that\n\n118\n00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.140\nis available documented legitimately\navailable for situations like this but\n\n119\n00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.610\nas a vendor you have to make\nthese arrangements ahead of time.\n\n120\n00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.900\nThey have to be cleared you can't\njust show up on site that morning And\n\n121\n00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.820\nexpect an I-A officer to\nbe available to meet you.\n\n122\n00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.250\nTo devote time to scanning media,\nto sanitizing it,\n\n123\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.770\nto burning it, to authorized media.\n\n124\n00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.720\nAnd then clearing you and\nthe media through security.\n\n125\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.990\nAnd walking you to the system\nwhere you're gonna use that media.\n\n126\n00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.410\nInstalling it, under essentially\ncontrolled conditions, and\n\n127\n00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.790\nthen destroying the media, so\nthat it's no longer available for use.\n\n128\n00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.160\nThat's something that has to happen\nin these secure environments, but\n\n129\n00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.550\nis not something you just randomly\nshow up and say, by the way.\n\n130\n00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.680\nOn number five,\nwhen can we do this, right?\n\n131\n00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.010\nSo it's pretty involved and you know,\n\n132\n00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.110\nnot having done that, ahead of time made\nit even more complex because we were,\n\n133\n00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.180\nyou know, given the wrong information\nsince we were told that it would be\n\n134\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.370\npossible to access the material through\nthe cloud under certain conditions.\n\n135\n00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:09.100\nThe site we used was originally told it\nwould be available, turned out it would\n\n136\n00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.090\nnot be just based on some issues on\nthe particular network that we were on.\n\n137\n00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.950\nAnd as a result we had to fall\nback on a different plan.\n\n138\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.020\nAnd, you know, everything works out.\n\n139\n00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:18.030\nYou negotiate it, ultimately it works.\n\n140\n00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.260\nBut it takes time.\n\n141\n00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.840\nAnd so one of the issues you really\nhave to think about in the cloud with\n\n142\n00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.680\nregards to data access and risk management\nis, do I have the time to set this up and\n\n143\n00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.310\ndo it securely?\n\n144\n00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.150\nAnd what does that time mean?\n\n145\n00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.870\nBecause time is money, as we often hear.\n\n146\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.610\nWhat does that time allocation\nmean to my customer and\n\n147\n00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.200\nwhat does it mean to the business?\n\n148\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.060\nBecause you've got to burn\nmultiple resources, time Right and\n\n149\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.640\nthat value has to be recaptured\nsomewhere to get this done.\n\n150\n00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.660\nSo we have to think about functions.\n\n151\n00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.372\nWe have to think about actors, have to\nthink about controls and have all these\n\n152\n00:07:46.372 --> 00:07:50.255\nthings come together essentially, right,\nto be able to equal not only access to\n\n153\n00:07:50.255 --> 00:07:53.707\ndata but use of data and availability\nof data within our cloud systems.\n\n154\n00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:56.447\nActors are gonna be\nthe individuals as subjects.\n\n155\n00:07:56.447 --> 00:07:58.606\nThat are going to want to get to the data.\n\n156\n00:07:58.606 --> 00:08:00.650\nLocation has to be considered.\n\n157\n00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.620\nThis is where the data lives, typically,\nand the path we use to get there.\n\n158\n00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.390\nWe have to think about functions.\n\n159\n00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.760\nThese are going to be\nthings like accessing data,\n\n160\n00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.850\nprocessing data, storing data.\n\n161\n00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.730\nThese are the activities, essentially,\nthat we engage in every day, but\n\n162\n00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.970\nwe often take it for granted, and\n\n163\n00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.060\nwe don't really stop and think through\nwhat is involved in doing that.\n\n164\n00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.660\nWe just pop a thumb drive into\nour laptop and off we go.\n\n165\n00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.930\nBut when you can't do that, you have\nto step back and really think through\n\n166\n00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.300\nwhat those functions are and\nhow to break them down to manage them.\n\n167\n00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.670\nIt's the CCSPs responsibility to\nunderstand how to do these things.\n\n168\n00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.310\nAre these things possible?\n\n169\n00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.510\nAre they allowed?\n\n170\n00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.270\nWe have two categories, typically, right?\n\n171\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.870\nIt's theoretically possible, but it may or\n\n172\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.250\nmay not be allowed at that\nparticular moment in time.\n\n173\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.540\nOr it may not be possible, and\ntherefore, it may not be allowed.\n\n174\n00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.310\nOr it may be allowed, but\nit may not be possible, right?\n\n175\n00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.030\nSo we have to think about the different\nways in which these things come together.\n\n176\n00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.150\nWhen we think about key data functions,\nspecifically, and\n\n177\n00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.090\nwe talked about functions being things\nlike accessing, processing, storing,\n\n178\n00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.650\nwe have to understand that ultimately,\nwe can break those activities down.\n\n179\n00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.590\nWe can think about creation, use,\nshare, store, archive, and destroy.\n\n180\n00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:10.100\nThese are the six areas or\nphases of the data life cycle.\n\n181\n00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.170\nAnd we can assign and\n\n182\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:15.520\nalign every area of the data life\ncycle to a key data function.\n\n183\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.620\nWe can use data under certain conditions.\n\n184\n00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.590\nWe can create it, we can store it.\n\n185\n00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:22.670\nSo every one of those things is\nan activity as well as the face of\n\n186\n00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.780\nthe life cycle or\n\n187\n00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.250\nwhat do we call a key data function as\nwell as the face of the life cycle.\n\n188\n00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:27.830\nWe have to understand that.\n\n189\n00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.656\nAs CCSPs, we have to be aware of that,\nwe have to manage accordingly, and\n\n190\n00:09:31.656 --> 00:09:35.425\nwe really need to understand what\nthose phases, what those functions,\n\n191\n00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:36.935\nwhat those activities are.\n\n192\n00:09:36.935 --> 00:09:39.280\nIt becomes very, very important to us.\n\n193\n00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.530\nControls are gonna act, essentially,\nas mechanisms that we, as either CCSPs or\n\n194\n00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:48.010\non the receiving end, as users that\nare gonna be managed by the control\n\n195\n00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.460\nhave to be aware of to use to frame\nconversations, frame activity, and\n\n196\n00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.080\nultimately frame the ability for users\nto interact with data to either do or\n\n197\n00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.590\nnot do certain activities based on\nthe kind of control we put in place.\n\n198\n00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.400\nIt's essentially a mechanism that\nrestricts access or, in some cases,\n\n199\n00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.690\nmay allow access but\nonly under certain conditions.\n\n200\n00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.966\nWe have to think about the kind\nof controls we wanna use.\n\n201\n00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:14.070\nWhen we go out, and we access data under\nnormal conditions in a network we control,\n\n202\n00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.560\nin an environment that we essentially are\na part of and authorized to use, there may\n\n203\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.730\nbe controls in place, but they're\nprobably going to be relatively limited.\n\n204\n00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.210\nWe'll have user controls that may\nsay this kind of user access is\n\n205\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.280\nthis kind of data under these conditions.\n\n206\n00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.730\nWe may call those,\nif they're time-based, for instance,\n\n207\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.460\ntemporal access control mechanisms where\nwe say during the hours of 9:00 to 5:00,\n\n208\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.300\nnormal business hours, we allow access.\n\n209\n00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:38.480\nOutside of that, we don't.\n\n210\n00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.611\nWe may have what are known as\nattribute-based access control mechanisms,\n\n211\n00:10:42.611 --> 00:10:46.934\nso you're coming in from this IP address\non this subnet or through this subnet,\n\n212\n00:10:46.934 --> 00:10:49.990\nthrough this remote area with\nthis kind of technology.\n\n213\n00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.469\nWe will or\nwon't authenticate you based on that,\n\n214\n00:10:52.469 --> 00:10:55.610\nthose are attribute-based\naccess control mechanisms.\n\n215\n00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.650\nWe may have discretionary or\nmandatory access control mechanisms\n\n216\n00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.560\nwhere we classify data and classify users,\nand the classifications must match and\n\n217\n00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.820\nuser and\ndata must be cleared at the same level.\n\n218\n00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.980\nThat's a mandatory axis control system.\n\n219\n00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:11.130\nA discretionary access control system,\n\n220\n00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.480\none that I think almost without\nexception all of us use all the time.\n\n221\n00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.440\nThink about the creator owner having\nrights to assign their data and\n\n222\n00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.020\ntheir rights to their data to anybody that\nthey would like as a discretionary access\n\n223\n00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.980\ncontrol system.\n\n224\n00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.438\nWe do that all the time in\nWindows environment, and\n\n225\n00:11:25.438 --> 00:11:29.170\nthen Apple-based environment, or\nMacintosh firm, or whatever it may be.\n\n226\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:33.686\nCan you pull up just permissions on a file\nreal quick, on any file on your desktop or\n\n227\n00:11:33.686 --> 00:11:34.346\nwhatever?\n\n228\n00:11:34.346 --> 00:11:35.774\nIt doesn't really matter which one it is,\nbut\n\n229\n00:11:35.774 --> 00:11:37.098\nis that something you can just quickly do?\n\n230\n00:11:37.098 --> 00:11:39.339\n>> I don't have one at the ready.\n\n231\n00:11:39.339 --> 00:11:40.616\n>> All right, so\nwe'll give Daniel a second.\n\n232\n00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:44.668\nI'm just gonna show you quickly what\ndiscretionary access control may\n\n233\n00:11:44.668 --> 00:11:45.638\nlook like.\n\n234\n00:11:45.638 --> 00:11:50.050\nWhat I wanna do is, essentially,\njust show the nice people out there\n\n235\n00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.390\nin our audience just what\na permission is on a file and\n\n236\n00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.590\nshow how a noder could centrally modify\nthat, if that makes sense, right?\n\n237\n00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:58.480\nSo we'll let Daniel chew on that for\njust a second and\n\n238\n00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.940\ntry to figure that out for us.\n\n239\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.520\nAnd the idea is essentially that\nwe have all these different\n\n240\n00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.670\nkinds of access control mechanisms.\n\n241\n00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:06.750\nAnd controls are not just access controls.\n\n242\n00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.390\nThat's usually the main\ncategory we focus on, but\n\n243\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.240\nit may not be the only category, right?\n\n244\n00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.130\nWe may have other controls\nthat are in place.\n\n245\n00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:16.770\nPhysical controls, guards, guns,\nand gates that will bar or\n\n246\n00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.000\nallow access in one form or another.\n\n247\n00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.450\nWe may decide that we want to\nthink about logical controls.\n\n248\n00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.320\nWe may have administrative controls.\n\n249\n00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.980\nWe may have technical controls.\n\n250\n00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.490\nThese may be policies.\n\n251\n00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:28.940\nThese may be procedures.\n\n252\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.710\nThese may be VLANs, so things like\nlogical controls such as virtual LANs.\n\n253\n00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.952\nWe may have physical and logical controls,\nin other words, that take place and\n\n254\n00:12:36.952 --> 00:12:41.386\ncoordinate or interact with one another\nto essentially create the opportunity for\n\n255\n00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:44.740\nus as CCSPs or as any kind of\nsecurity professional to modify and\n\n256\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.595\nconstrain behavior.\n\n257\n00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:48.535\nThis is really what controls\nare necessary to do.\n\n258\n00:12:48.535 --> 00:12:52.738\nThey can be used to structure and,\nultimately, to decide on access,\n\n259\n00:12:52.738 --> 00:12:54.955\ngranting or denying of that access.\n\n260\n00:12:54.955 --> 00:12:58.965\nAnd essentially, the controls associated\nwith that access can be audited and\n\n261\n00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:02.745\nmonitored, so we understand who's\ndoing what under what conditions.\n\n262\n00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:06.310\n>> Yeah, I quickly brought\nup the unix access controls.\n\n263\n00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.622\n>> Okay, I can't really see too\nmuch of what is on the screen, so\n\n264\n00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:09.560\nwhy don't you narrate?\n\n265\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.260\n>> I will zoom in.\n\n266\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.307\nAll right, [INAUDIBLE] just because of the\nshading, and the grey in the background,\n\n267\n00:13:14.307 --> 00:13:15.790\nit's just, that's better.\n\n268\n00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.596\nIt was just really hard\nto see what was there.\n\n269\n00:13:16.596 --> 00:13:18.730\nOkay, so you've got have read,\nwrite, read, and read.\n\n270\n00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:19.930\nIt looks like r, w, r, r.\n\n271\n00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.166\nSo you've got attributes in this case,\n\n272\n00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:25.340\nwhich is what we refer to them\nas access controls, yeah.\n\n273\n00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.930\nEssentially, they\nare permissions in Windows.\n\n274\n00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:31.416\nWe would essentially call them the same\nthing here, but they are file attributes\n\n275\n00:13:31.416 --> 00:13:35.056\nthat are assigning permission or access,\nand so we've got it looks like on whatever\n\n276\n00:13:35.056 --> 00:13:37.540\nfile you brought up,\nyou've got a read, write, r, w.\n\n277\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.484\nYou've got two r, which are read only,\nand so you've got a mixture of different\n\n278\n00:13:41.484 --> 00:13:44.920\nattributes that are assigned for\npermission or access here, right?\n\n279\n00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:48.950\nAnd so when we look at that, and\nthis is the Linux, Unix model.\n\n280\n00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.529\nThis is what Windows is based on, but\nWindows puts a nice graphical overlay on\n\n281\n00:13:52.529 --> 00:13:55.724\ntop of it and assigns additional\npermissions or attributes as well,\n\n282\n00:13:55.724 --> 00:13:57.780\ncuz we have read, write, we have execute.\n\n283\n00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.731\nYou would see as an X there if we had\nexecute, and we also have more grandular\n\n284\n00:14:01.731 --> 00:14:05.150\nlevel permissions,\nwhat we call Windows Advance Permission.\n\n285\n00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.846\nSo we may have two or\nthree different kinds of read,\n\n286\n00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.552\ndepending on the depth we go to.\n\n287\n00:14:09.552 --> 00:14:13.079\nSo yeah, we could do a CH mod, and we\ncould take a look or Sudo either way, and\n\n288\n00:14:13.079 --> 00:14:16.664\nyou would see different depending on\nwho you're logged on as what permission\n\n289\n00:14:16.664 --> 00:14:17.180\nyou have.\n\n290\n00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.280\nWe would see different takes on that,\nright?\n\n291\n00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.880\nAnd so here in Linux Unix 101,\nwe actually [LAUGH]\n\n292\n00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.665\n>> Helps if I click the right file name\n\n293\n00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.240\n[LAUGH]\n>> When we have the right file name.\n\n294\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.130\nIt's okay, just the idea was just to show\n\n295\n00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.750\nthe fact that with a discretionary\naccess control model, Daniel or\n\n296\n00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.220\nwhoever may be logged on can control and\nchange that read, write, or read, or\n\n297\n00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:41.290\nexecute a level for those permissions\nbased on being the owner of the data.\n\n298\n00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:45.000\nIf you create the data essentially,\nyou're able to assign permissions to it.\n\n299\n00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.650\nIf you're not the owner,\nyou may have rights to use it, but\n\n300\n00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.990\nyou typically don't have rights to modify\nthe permissions unless you're given full\n\n301\n00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.250\nadministrative control.\n\n302\n00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.740\nAnd full control would imply that, but\nwe would have to then understand that and\n\n303\n00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.370\nbe aware of that.\n\n304\n00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:00.104\nSo these are the examples of the kind of\ndifferent access controls that may exist,\n\n305\n00:15:00.104 --> 00:15:03.410\nand there's all sorts of different ones\nthat we could look at, as we said.\n\n306\n00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:06.180\nWe have to think about all sorts\nof relevant data technology,\n\n307\n00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.490\ndata control technology,\ndata security technology.\n\n308\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.443\nYou always figure it out after we're done,\nright?\n\n309\n00:15:10.443 --> 00:15:11.059\n>> Yeah, I got it.\n\n310\n00:15:11.059 --> 00:15:13.790\n>> The minute we stop looking,\nit shows up, and it's there.\n\n311\n00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.810\nSo you've got all sorts of\ndifferent stuff, right?\n\n312\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:17.480\nYeah, so there's execute, as well.\n\n313\n00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.750\nRewrite execute is there, and\nwe've got different rewrite execute\n\n314\n00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.540\nset up on the three different areas that\nwe will look at for file access, right?\n\n315\n00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:29.370\nSo you've get three sets\nof permissions there.\n\n316\n00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.140\nSo the idea would be that we essentially\ncan assign these different levels of\n\n317\n00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.330\npermissions on looks like the PDF or\nwhatever you're looking at, right?\n\n318\n00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:35.948\n>> Yeah, the OWAS PDF.\n\n319\n00:15:35.948 --> 00:15:37.660\n>> Okay, the OWAS,\nbecause I can only see part.\n\n320\n00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.800\nI see a PDF, I don't see the other stuff\noff to the right that is trailing.\n\n321\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.760\nSo on the OWASP pdf, there you go, yeah.\n\n322\n00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.000\nSee, I couldn't see the path.\n\n323\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.903\nAll I could see was PDF at the very end.\n\n324\n00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:49.574\nSo we've got rewrite execute, since\nDaniel's got full control over that file,\n\n325\n00:15:49.574 --> 00:15:53.456\nbecause he downloaded, he didn't create\nit Quote unquote, he didn't write it, but\n\n326\n00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:56.401\nhe did download it essentially and\ninstantiate it in the system.\n\n327\n00:15:56.401 --> 00:15:58.474\nThat makes him\nthe creator/owner of that file.\n\n328\n00:15:58.474 --> 00:16:03.082\nAnd as a result he has read-write execute\nor the equivalent of full control, right,\n\n329\n00:16:03.082 --> 00:16:03.915\nfor that file.\n\n330\n00:16:03.915 --> 00:16:05.580\nGood, that's very helpful.\n\n331\n00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.054\nSo when we think about potential\ncontrols and solutions,\n\n332\n00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:10.088\nwanna think about things\nlike what we just saw.\n\n333\n00:16:10.088 --> 00:16:14.753\nWe also wanna think about DLP, data loss,\nor data leakage prevention technology.\n\n334\n00:16:14.753 --> 00:16:17.280\nWe wanna think about encryption,\nwe've talked about encryption already.\n\n335\n00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.560\nWe wanna think about access monitoring for\nuse of data.\n\n336\n00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.050\nWanna think about mechanisms\nlike obfuscation, anonymization,\n\n337\n00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.780\ntokenization and masking.\n\n338\n00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.575\nWe'll get into some of these different\nsolutions and thought processes as we go.\n\n339\n00:16:29.575 --> 00:16:32.724\nBut we have to think about the different\nways in which we will use these\n\n340\n00:16:32.724 --> 00:16:36.475\ntechnologies against the different cloud\nmodels that exist from a deployment and\n\n341\n00:16:36.475 --> 00:16:37.850\nfrom a service perspective.\n\n342\n00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.470\nAnd we keep coming back to the idea of\ndeployment models with regards to private,\n\n343\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.680\npublic, hybrid and community clouds.\n\n344\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:47.206\nSo we keep coming back to the idea of\nservice models with regards to IaaS,\n\n345\n00:16:47.206 --> 00:16:48.530\nPaaS and SaaS.\n\n346\n00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.855\nAnd so we have to think across all\nthese different mix and match options.\n\n347\n00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:55.760\nIaaS in the private cloud,\nIaaS in a hybrid cloud, right?\n\n348\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.995\nPaaS across a community cloud.\n\n349\n00:16:57.995 --> 00:17:02.330\nSaaS through a public cloud or\na hybrid cloud or a private cloud.\n\n350\n00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:06.370\nThese are different ways in which we can\nconfigure and consume information, and\n\n351\n00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:07.610\nwe have to be aware of that.\n\n352\n00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.110\nSo we have to think about cloud services,\n\n353\n00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:13.130\nproducts, and solutions to really\nunderstand, ultimately, how\n\n354\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.980\nall this functionality combines together\nto give us the ability to control data.\n\n355\n00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:17.910\nAs a CCSP,\n\n356\n00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:23.070\nit's our responsibility to understand\nthe usage patterns of our customers and\n\n357\n00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.530\nto then provide the appropriate solutions\nbased on that usage thought process.\n\n358\n00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.300\nIf we own the private cloud on-prem, and\nit's totally us, we are the provider,\n\n359\n00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.070\nas we've talked about,\nit's a very different thought process,\n\n360\n00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.625\nvery different place to see ourselves,\nand ultimately manage risk from.\n\n361\n00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:41.531\nThan if we have a private cloud that is\nmanaged by a third party provider, or\n\n362\n00:17:41.531 --> 00:17:45.942\nif we have a hybrid cloud that involves\nhosted and perhaps private infrastructure.\n\n363\n00:17:45.942 --> 00:17:47.940\nThere may be a blend in some way.\n\n364\n00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.690\nWe have to think about these different\noptions and really understand them.\n\n365\n00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:53.660\nThe tools for\nprocessing data have to be considered.\n\n366\n00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.910\nYour vendors, such as Amazon,\nwill have their own set of tools.\n\n367\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:00.730\nVendors such as Microsoft on the Azure\nFabric have their own set of tools.\n\n368\n00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.070\nWe may have to use those tools,\n\n369\n00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:06.185\nthose APIs provided by the vendor in\norder to essentially manage the platform.\n\n370\n00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:10.025\nOr if we are in the private cloud business\nourselves, if we are either an ISP,\n\n371\n00:18:10.025 --> 00:18:12.835\na cloud service provider of some kind, or\n\n372\n00:18:12.835 --> 00:18:17.305\nif we are the IT function that's\nproviding private cloud on-prem,\n\n373\n00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:21.515\nwhile we still may have to use the tools\nthe vendor provides, we can provide\n\n374\n00:18:21.515 --> 00:18:26.010\na private OnCloud, private OnCloud,\na new form of cloud, private OnCloud.\n\n375\n00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:27.378\nIt's like OnStar, but OnCloud.\n\n376\n00:18:27.378 --> 00:18:31.860\nThe private on-prem, right, cloud,\nwe have to use the vendor's platform.\n\n377\n00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.614\nSo we may use Microsoft's cloud platform,\nI'm just mixing and\n\n378\n00:18:35.614 --> 00:18:38.420\nmatching my words and metaphors here.\n\n379\n00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.900\nSo we may be using Microsoft's\nprivate cloud technology base,\n\n380\n00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.950\nright, so we may use\nthe Azure Fabric to host off-prem.\n\n381\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.470\nWe may use the ability for\n\n382\n00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:52.330\nthe system center cloud infrastructure to\nbe run on-prem and privately control it.\n\n383\n00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.687\nOr we may link it to the private,\nour private cloud on-prem may be linked to\n\n384\n00:18:55.687 --> 00:18:58.430\nthe Azure Fabric so\nwe may host the directory in the cloud and\n\n385\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.300\nhave the infrastructure locally when\nwe have a hybrid of some kind, right?\n\n386\n00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.110\nHowever we do it, we're still gonna be\nusing a vendor's technology platform.\n\n387\n00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.150\nWe're not gonna make all\nthe apps up ourselves.\n\n388\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.840\nWe're not gonna create\neverything from scratch.\n\n389\n00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.250\nAnd we could, in theory, right?\n\n390\n00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.080\nSomebody has to create\nthese at some point.\n\n391\n00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:12.970\nBut we're gonna be smart.\n\n392\n00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:16.390\nWe're gonna consume, right,\nthings off the shelf as much as possible.\n\n393\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:21.120\nWe may then customize, we may tweak,\nwe may add certain kinds of functionality\n\n394\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.730\nthat we want, or create it through the use\nof scripts of automation or whatever.\n\n395\n00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.180\nBut it's gonna be within the broad\nboundary of parameters of what\n\n396\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.790\nthe partner, or in this case, what the\ntechnology platform provider has given us.\n\n397\n00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.072\nSo we are using those technology tools.\n\n398\n00:19:35.072 --> 00:19:38.120\nWe are using those technology items\nto essentially to be able to do that.\n\n399\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:40.550\nSo it's something to just consider and\nto be aware of.\n\n400\n00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.035\nWe're moving data and/or preserving,\nstoring data, right?\n\n401\n00:19:43.035 --> 00:19:45.200\nAnd so, as a result,\nwe have to think about,\n\n402\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.050\nas we not just talk about deployment\nmodels and not just service models, but\n\n403\n00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.280\nthe different ways in which data is\nconsumed as we've talked about, right,\n\n404\n00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.590\nin use, at rest and\nthen the wire on the wire in transit.\n\n405\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.990\nWe have to think about all these different\nareas and how they all come together for\n\n406\n00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:02.510\nus to then be able to decide\nwhat cloud storage will be,\n\n407\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.230\nwhat cloud data is,\nwhat cloud data security will be.\n\n408\n00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.765\nWe have to think about all that, because\ncloud storage is essentially data that is\n\n409\n00:20:09.765 --> 00:20:12.943\npresented, available over the network,\nsomehow made available to us,\n\n410\n00:20:12.943 --> 00:20:15.224\nessentially as a service over the network,\nright?\n\n411\n00:20:15.224 --> 00:20:17.501\nWe're just consuming it in one form or\nanother, and\n\n412\n00:20:17.501 --> 00:20:19.280\nwe're pulling it across the wire.\n\n413\n00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.671\nThat network may be limited to our\ndata center, may be local, and\n\n414\n00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:23.727\ntherefore closed.\n\n415\n00:20:23.727 --> 00:20:28.419\nIt may be over a public network like\nthe Internet to pull data in from a Fabric\n\n416\n00:20:28.419 --> 00:20:30.740\nprovider like Microsoft or Amazon.\n\n417\n00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:33.862\nAnd pulling it in from their data\ncenter over a public network back\n\n418\n00:20:33.862 --> 00:20:36.480\ninto a private space\nthrough a hybrid solution.\n\n419\n00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.806\nThere's different ways to do this, but\nultimately whether it's an IaaS, PaaS or\n\n420\n00:20:39.806 --> 00:20:43.760\nSaaS model, we have to get to data and\nwe have to figure out how to control data.\n\n421\n00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:46.340\nAnd cloud data security becomes\nvery important as a result of that.\n\n422\n00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:50.650\nWhen we think about infrastructure as\na service, remember, we're thinking about\n\n423\n00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.510\nthe cloud provider giving us\nthe infrastructure, us being the customer,\n\n424\n00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.190\ngiving us the infrastructure that\nwe've ordered up, essentially, right?\n\n425\n00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.360\nAnd then we are going to provision it.\n\n426\n00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.930\nSo as the customer, we'll install the OS,\nright, we'll set up and configure\n\n427\n00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:09.330\nthe monitoring of that OS inside the host,\nor on the host for multiple hosts.\n\n428\n00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.820\nWe'll configure the resource clusters for\nthe hosts.\n\n429\n00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:13.830\nWe will share out those resources and\n\n430\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:17.960\nthen set up virtualization for guest\noperating systems on top of those hosts.\n\n431\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.980\nBut that actual physical\ninfrastructure is being rented,\n\n432\n00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:22.600\nnumber one, it's not being owned by us.\n\n433\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.470\nAnd number two, even though we're\ngiven probably the most access and\n\n434\n00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:31.280\nthe most control of any of the cloud\nservice models using IaaS as the customer,\n\n435\n00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.060\nwe're not in complete control.\n\n436\n00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.360\nThe vendor, the cloud service provider,\nstill owns the back end network,\n\n437\n00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:41.180\nstill owns the back end storage,\nstill is probably chunking that storage up\n\n438\n00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:46.070\ninto lines that are logically presented,\nmassed and zoned for us out of the common\n\n439\n00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:50.380\nresource pools on the back end that are\nserving multiple customers simultaneously.\n\n440\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.980\nWe may pay a premium for\ndedicated hosting and\n\n441\n00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.720\ndedicated resources that are just unique\nto us, that are not multi-tenant.\n\n442\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.570\nWe can do that in an IaaS model.\n\n443\n00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.800\nBut even then, it's not truly ours, and\nwe don't control every aspect of it.\n\n444\n00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.820\nBecause if we have to go on\nthe back end physically and\n\n445\n00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.230\nadd more disks to an array\nbecause disks are failing,\n\n446\n00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:13.930\nif we have to go into a wiring area and\nreconfigure virtual or\n\n447\n00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:19.120\nphysical infrastructure to then align with\nthe new configuration we want in IaaS.\n\n448\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.060\nThat's gonna be the vendor's job,\ncuz we're not in the data center, right.\n\n449\n00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.380\nWe don't have access to it.\n\n450\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.950\nThere's gonna be some\nsort of individual or\n\n451\n00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:28.470\ngroup of individuals from the data\ncenter that will do that.\n\n452\n00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.759\nAnd so we have to think about the fact\nthat ultimately, even in IaaS,\n\n453\n00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:33.870\nwe don't have complete control.\n\n454\n00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.640\nAnd there may not be complete\nvisibility into every aspect of this.\n\n455\n00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.470\nSo we have to think about these things,\nright.\n\n456\n00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.218\nWe can purchase IaaS, purchase PaaS,\npurchase SaaS and rent it and\n\n457\n00:22:42.218 --> 00:22:44.150\nwe pay based on consumption.\n\n458\n00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:45.060\nBut ultimately,\n\n459\n00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:50.050\nit's not gonna be something that we as\nthe cloud customer exclusively own.\n\n460\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.680\nIt's something that we are partnering\nwith and essentially borrowing, right.\n\n461\n00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.650\nSo that's just something to be\naware of and think about as well.\n\n462\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:01.052\nWhen we think about IaaS specifically and\nIaaS storage types, we have to think about\n\n463\n00:23:01.052 --> 00:23:04.462\nthe fact that we are using storage,\nagain from a cloud provider,\n\n464\n00:23:04.462 --> 00:23:08.970\neven though we are essentially renting it,\nright, they are providing it to us.\n\n465\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.440\nAnd we are using it on their network and\nwe essentially are consuming it\n\n466\n00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.390\nin one of several forms,\nbased on the agreements we have.\n\n467\n00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:18.990\nSo, we can either use object storage or\nwhat we would call volume or\n\n468\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:19.850\nblock storage.\n\n469\n00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.180\nAnd we have to think about\nthe different storage types.\n\n470\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.553\nSo, Dan, I'm going to bring you\nback into the conversation here for\n\n471\n00:23:25.553 --> 00:23:29.275\na second cuz you have always been able to\nshed some light and add some value and\n\n472\n00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:31.570\ncontent into what we're\ntalking about here.\n\n473\n00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.895\nSo when we talk about object storage,\nwe talk about volume or block storage,\n\n474\n00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:36.850\ncuz it is often referred\nto as block storage.\n\n475\n00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.470\nBut it's block or volume storage.\n\n476\n00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.663\nWe think about the different\nobject types with IaaS, right?\n\n477\n00:23:41.663 --> 00:23:45.217\nDo you have a sense of what volume or\nblock storage is if I asked you, hey,\n\n478\n00:23:45.217 --> 00:23:46.848\ncould you describe that to me, or\n\n479\n00:23:46.848 --> 00:23:50.020\nmaybe could you give me a sense of\nhow we would see that consumed?\n\n480\n00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.414\nWhat do you think you would say?\n\n481\n00:23:51.414 --> 00:23:52.713\n>> Well, what would you say?\n\n482\n00:23:52.713 --> 00:23:53.318\n>> Yeah, what would I say, right?\n\n483\n00:23:53.318 --> 00:23:55.418\n>> What would you say\nis what I mean to say.\n\n484\n00:23:55.418 --> 00:23:59.985\n>> What I would say is volume storage\ntends to be the data volumes,\n\n485\n00:23:59.985 --> 00:24:02.149\nthis is the volume of my data.\n\n486\n00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:06.790\nWhere block storage is what is\non the disk at this bit level.\n\n487\n00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.890\n>> Well, remember, block and\nvolume are essentially,\n\n488\n00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:10.410\nwe would use those terms interchangeably.\n\n489\n00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.040\n>> Interchangeably, okay.\n\n490\n00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.669\n>> Let's think about block and\nvolume together, right?\n\n491\n00:24:12.669 --> 00:24:15.503\n>> Just keeping it, this is my data,\nthis is the volume of it,\n\n492\n00:24:15.503 --> 00:24:18.220\nand that's what I would say is our volume.\n\n493\n00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.650\n>> Okay so when we say block or\n\n494\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.220\nvolume can I maybe just add a word\nin there to help us clarify.\n\n495\n00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.098\nWould we say essentially cuz when we say\nvolume right we traditionally know at\n\n496\n00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:29.554\nleast most of us know when\nwe talk about volumes.\n\n497\n00:24:29.554 --> 00:24:32.456\nThat we traditionally were talking about\nwhat we think of as a hard drive right?\n\n498\n00:24:32.456 --> 00:24:34.130\nI'm sure that's kinda\nwhat you're implying.\n\n499\n00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.346\nWe don't tend to say I've got a volume,\nwe tend to say I've got this hard drive or\n\n500\n00:24:38.346 --> 00:24:42.438\nI've mounted this amount of data in this\ndrive space or with this mount point or\n\n501\n00:24:42.438 --> 00:24:44.610\nthis symbolic link or whatever it may be.\n\n502\n00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.354\n>> It's the Windows\nterminology that throws us.\n\n503\n00:24:46.354 --> 00:24:49.782\nBecause we think of volumes in Windows,\nit's that they're on the disk, but\n\n504\n00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:52.610\nthey're separate from\nspeaking about the disk.\n\n505\n00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.210\n>> They're the logical representation\nof the physical storage.\n\n506\n00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.261\nEssentially, they're LUNs,\nif you want to think of it that way.\n\n507\n00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.910\n>> There you go.\n>> Because that's essentially what they\n\n508\n00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.890\nare, but we don't really think\nof them that way in Windows.\n\n509\n00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.295\nWhen was the last time you said\nI mounted three LUNs today.\n\n510\n00:25:03.295 --> 00:25:05.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you do virtualization, right?\n\n511\n00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.390\nYou use SAN, storage area networks,\nyou think about LUNs all the time, but\n\n512\n00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.350\nthe reality is in Windows,\n\n513\n00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:12.400\non a laptop, you don't really think about\nLUNs, you think about drive letters.\n\n514\n00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.770\nI've got a D drive,\nyou may say I've got a partition.\n\n515\n00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:19.290\nBut the reality is while yes absolutely\nit is in theory the representation of\n\n516\n00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.124\nthe physical storage\nit's essentially a LUN.\n\n517\n00:25:22.124 --> 00:25:24.271\nIt's also in theory a symbolic link or\n\n518\n00:25:24.271 --> 00:25:28.711\na mount point we could refer to it either\nway cuz it all kind of is the same thing.\n\n519\n00:25:28.711 --> 00:25:31.130\nTo your point, we don't really\nthink about it in Windows that way.\n\n520\n00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.970\nWe say, well, I've got a C drive and\nthe C drive may or\n\n521\n00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.730\nmay not be the whole physical drive.\n\n522\n00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.170\nAnd so when we think about block storage,\n\n523\n00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:40.000\nwe're thinking about fixed\nsized raw storage capacity.\n\n524\n00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.670\nTo Daniel's point,\nwe're thinking about volumes, essentially.\n\n525\n00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:44.670\nAnd the volumes are treated\nas independent drives,\n\n526\n00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:46.170\nthat's traditionally how we see them.\n\n527\n00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:49.980\nWe may give them a C drive designation,\nwe may give them a LUN designation.\n\n528\n00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.730\nLUN 1, LUN 5,\ndoesn't really matter, what it is.\n\n529\n00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.840\nBut we then control them through\nan external operating system of some kind.\n\n530\n00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.410\nSo Windows will interact with them,\nLinux will mount them,\n\n531\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.163\nessentially the same thing.\n\n532\n00:26:02.163 --> 00:26:04.026\nVMWare, ZSXI will mount one or\n\n533\n00:26:04.026 --> 00:26:08.290\nmore LUNs through a interface of\nsome kind to make storage available.\n\n534\n00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.315\nHyper-V will do the same\nthing as will Xen,\n\n535\n00:26:11.315 --> 00:26:14.925\nXen Server, on the Citrix side,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n536\n00:26:14.925 --> 00:26:17.505\nThe block device is mounted by\nthe guest operating system and\n\n537\n00:26:17.505 --> 00:26:20.300\ntreated essentially as if\nit were a physical drive.\n\n538\n00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.770\nWe see it as being Drive 1 or\nDisk 0 or whatever it may be.\n\n539\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.470\nAnd the common examples\nof block storage or\n\n540\n00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.570\nvolume storage that we\noften think about are SAN,\n\n541\n00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:32.240\nas I mentioned, Storage Area Networks,\nISCSI, it's a SCSI over the Internet.\n\n542\n00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.940\nAnd local drives, as Daniel pointed\nout and we were talking about.\n\n543\n00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.640\nEssentially, it's like a volume and\na volume is\n\n544\n00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:41.540\nwhy we use that term interchangeably\ncuz it's often seem the same way.\n\n545\n00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.510\nWhen we think about block\nstorage in the Cloud,\n\n546\n00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.180\nwe think about the fact that\nmany of these providers\n\n547\n00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.480\nactually many of the Cloud providers\nare providing this kinda storage.\n\n548\n00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.730\nSo you can go to Amazon, you can go\nto Google, you can go to Microsoft or\n\n549\n00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.020\nany of these big providers and\nyou can get this kind of storage.\n\n550\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:03.795\nYou may format it using a proprietary\nfile format from the operating system\n\n551\n00:27:03.795 --> 00:27:06.425\nvendor you're mounting it through.\n\n552\n00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:08.345\nSo if you use VMWare's ZSXI,\n\n553\n00:27:08.345 --> 00:27:12.457\nyou're going to format it typically\nwith VMFS, the VMWare file system.\n\n554\n00:27:12.457 --> 00:27:14.037\nIf you mount it through Microsoft,\n\n555\n00:27:14.037 --> 00:27:17.387\nyou're gonna use most likely NTFS,\nthe NT file system.\n\n556\n00:27:17.387 --> 00:27:20.807\nYou may use FAT, although the reality is\nFAT's really not gonna be very good for\n\n557\n00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:24.647\nthis cuz you're partition size is gonna\nbe relatively small by comparison.\n\n558\n00:27:24.647 --> 00:27:27.543\nYou're limited to a much\nsmaller size with FAT.\n\n559\n00:27:27.543 --> 00:27:28.743\nBut you know we may do that t or\n\n560\n00:27:28.743 --> 00:27:32.953\nthere might be a proprietary file system\nof any number of types that could be used.\n\n561\n00:27:32.953 --> 00:27:38.373\nYou may use EXT on Linux Unix systems for\ninstance or things of that nature.\n\n562\n00:27:38.373 --> 00:27:39.913\nSo there's different ways to do this but\n\n563\n00:27:39.913 --> 00:27:41.813\nthe idea is that's where\nwe would see this.\n\n564\n00:27:41.813 --> 00:27:45.263\nThings like RAID volumes are gonna\nbe examples of block storage or\n\n565\n00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:46.203\nvolume storage.\n\n566\n00:27:46.203 --> 00:27:50.200\nSo using RAID for\ninstance would come in here.\n\n567\n00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.763\nMission critical apps like Oracle,\nSAP, Microsoft SQL,\n\n568\n00:27:53.763 --> 00:27:58.048\nExchange, SharePoint, etc,\nthey all run on these kinds of systems.\n\n569\n00:27:58.048 --> 00:28:01.891\nWhen we run virtualized environments and\nVM's are mounted or I guest operating\n\n570\n00:28:01.891 --> 00:28:05.558\nsystems are mounted, they mount this\nstorage as if it were hard drives, and\n\n571\n00:28:05.558 --> 00:28:08.389\nthey see them as individual\nhard drives that are mounted.\n\n572\n00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:10.379\nAnd they behave like\nthey're physical drives,\n\n573\n00:28:10.379 --> 00:28:14.020\neven though we know we're virtualizing the\nstorage abstracting through a hypervisor,\n\n574\n00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:17.590\nand essentially making it appear as if\nit's physical, when indeed it's not.\n\n575\n00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.550\nIt is somewhere, but\nit's not directly related to that VM or\n\n576\n00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.620\nthat running instance.\n\n577\n00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.790\nBut that's how we would see this.\n\n578\n00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.660\nSo, you have some block\nstorage options in the Cloud.\n\n579\n00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:28.080\nI mentioned things like Amazon, so EBS,\n\n580\n00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:31.345\nelastic block storage on\nAmazon is an example of this.\n\n581\n00:28:31.345 --> 00:28:35.030\nRackspace and their Cloud Block Storage\nsolution would be an example.\n\n582\n00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:38.970\nThe Azure platform has this, I think\nthey call it premium storage on Azure,\n\n583\n00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.530\nalthough it changes all the time,\nthey're always rebranding.\n\n584\n00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.190\nGoogle persistent disks.\n\n585\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:47.160\nThese are all examples of blocker\nvolume level storage that we would see.\n\n586\n00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.500\nWhen we think about object storage,\n\n587\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.320\nthe other kind of storage, so what do\nwe think about with object storage?\n\n588\n00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.270\nSo we've identified volume or\nblock storage,\n\n589\n00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.055\nwe've nailed that definition, right?\n\n590\n00:28:55.055 --> 00:28:58.044\nSaid it's basically like looking\nat a hard drive that's mounted and\n\n591\n00:28:58.044 --> 00:28:59.340\nbehaves as a physical drive.\n\n592\n00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.114\nWhether it's logical or physical to the OS\nit is somewhere physical on the back end\n\n593\n00:29:03.114 --> 00:29:04.935\nand a representation of storage.\n\n594\n00:29:04.935 --> 00:29:05.885\nBut what about objects storage.\n\n595\n00:29:05.885 --> 00:29:09.000\nWhat do we see there for IS what are we\nthinking about for object storage?\n\n596\n00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.680\nMaybe things like unstructured files?\n\n597\n00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:16.899\nSo, large files like movies or\nmusic, for instance.\n\n598\n00:29:16.899 --> 00:29:19.390\nOr unstructured data would be good\ncandidates for object storage.\n\n599\n00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.380\n>> Yeah, just anything that's a file or\n\n600\n00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.649\nsome portion of data that's\nresiding on a disk somewhere.\n\n601\n00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.930\n>> Yeah,\nthat's a good way of thinking about it.\n\n602\n00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.110\nSo unstructured data would\nbe a good example of that.\n\n603\n00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:35.720\nBackup files that are gonna be put\nsomewhere that we're gonna archive would\n\n604\n00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.640\nbe an example of this.\n\n605\n00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.130\nLog files, probably a good example.\n\n606\n00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:39.191\nThings that we would do with that.\n\n607\n00:29:39.191 --> 00:29:43.543\nAny large data sets we often talk about\nmounting large volumes of data today using\n\n608\n00:29:43.543 --> 00:29:44.830\nsomething like an RDM.\n\n609\n00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:49.100\nSo whether we're using a raw device map,\ndepending on the vendor and\n\n610\n00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.905\nthe terminology they use,\nVMWare calls that capability a RDM.\n\n611\n00:29:52.905 --> 00:29:57.035\nYou may see that, where we're just gonna\nbring in a very large volume of data, but\n\n612\n00:29:57.035 --> 00:30:01.505\nwe don't want to own it directly, mount\nit as a block level storage concept, or\n\n613\n00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:02.425\nvolume storage.\n\n614\n00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:04.875\nInstead, we want to use\nobjects to represent it.\n\n615\n00:30:04.875 --> 00:30:06.045\nAnd so it's just unstructured.\n\n616\n00:30:06.045 --> 00:30:07.745\nWe can then manage it and work with it.\n\n617\n00:30:07.745 --> 00:30:10.845\nArchive files that we're gonna put into\nlong term deep storage may fall into\n\n618\n00:30:10.845 --> 00:30:11.645\nthis category.\n\n619\n00:30:11.645 --> 00:30:14.261\nAny of these things can be good\nexamples of object based storage.\n\n620\n00:30:14.261 --> 00:30:19.124\nSo again, go back to the major vendors\nAmazon's S3 is an example of this\n\n621\n00:30:19.124 --> 00:30:20.650\nkind of option there.\n\n622\n00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:24.230\nRackspace has this with\ntheir Cloud File solution.\n\n623\n00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:28.590\nAzure Blob storage would be the Microsoft\nversion of this, so we see this.\n\n624\n00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.830\nGoogle has cloud storage, so Google's\nCloud storage would be an example of this.\n\n625\n00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:36.790\nAny of these kinda things would be\nexamples of the object storage category,\n\n626\n00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.440\nat least examples of them anyway.\n\n627\n00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.460\nSo we want to make sure we're comfortable\nwith the idea of the IS storage types.\n\n628\n00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.019\nThe differentiator between\nobject storage and volume or\n\n629\n00:30:45.019 --> 00:30:47.158\nwhat we commonly call block or\nvolume storage.\n\n630\n00:30:47.158 --> 00:30:48.820\nThe terms are interchangeable.\n\n631\n00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.240\nYou will see them referred to either\nway depending on who you read and\n\n632\n00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.330\nwhat the documentation is that you're\npaying attention to by vendor.\n\n633\n00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.570\nSo block or volume are interchangeable.\n\n634\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.980\nKnow them as interchangeable.\n\n635\n00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.250\nAnd then object store\njust the other category.\n\n636\n00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.860\nReal important for\nCCSPs to understand the difference\n\n637\n00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.270\nbetween these two storage\ntypes on the IS platform.\n\n638\n00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.989\nCuz we may very well consume both, but the\nreality is we have to understand what do\n\n639\n00:31:11.989 --> 00:31:14.081\nyou choose and\nwhat the benefits are of each.\n\n640\n00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:17.105\nAnd how each of those is presented\nto the operating system and or\n\n641\n00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:20.180\nthe interface that we're using\nto control access to data.\n\n642\n00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:22.130\nBecause we have to\nsecure them differently.\n\n643\n00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.960\nWe ultimately have access control on both.\n\n644\n00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.930\nBut the idea was how we approach\napplying that access control\n\n645\n00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:30.450\nwill be different based on the volume or\nthe kind of storage that we are mounting.\n\n646\n00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.120\nSo it's very important for\nus to think about and be aware of as well.\n\n647\n00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.400\nWith regards to PaaS,\nPlatform as a Service,\n\n648\n00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.340\nwe are obviously using storage types there\nas well, but remember we're up a level.\n\n649\n00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.386\nWe're not at the raw hard drive\nlevel at the infrastructure level,\n\n650\n00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:45.015\nnow we've bundled that along\nwith the operating system.\n\n651\n00:31:45.015 --> 00:31:48.767\nSo, we're gonna have things like databases\nrunning on the operating system and\n\n652\n00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:49.937\nbig data capabilities.\n\n653\n00:31:49.937 --> 00:31:54.573\nSo, data warehouses, data marts,\nthings like that Analytics cubes,\n\n654\n00:31:54.573 --> 00:31:59.513\nall that stuff is gonna be in the pass\ndata storage area because we're running\n\n655\n00:31:59.513 --> 00:32:04.088\nthe application workloads essentially\non top of the infrastructure.\n\n656\n00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:06.978\nWe may have blocked storage on\nthe back-end underlying it, but\n\n657\n00:32:06.978 --> 00:32:10.955\nwe're consuming it through an application\nthat's now sitting on top of the platform.\n\n658\n00:32:10.955 --> 00:32:14.510\nSo we have to understand that and\nbecause we're doing Abdev typically\n\n659\n00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:19.210\nrelated working pass, we have to frame our\ndata conversation from that perspective.\n\n660\n00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:21.720\nSo it's the front-end data,\nthe database, and\n\n661\n00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.940\nthe types of data that are managed in\nthat database that we would look at.\n\n662\n00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:29.024\nWith regards to SaaS, software as a\nservice, we're using the web essentially,\n\n663\n00:32:29.024 --> 00:32:33.124\nright, to connect to, through APIs that\nare published by the vendor, our data.\n\n664\n00:32:33.124 --> 00:32:37.077\nRemember, the two things customers have\nto do with SaaS, right, the two, and\n\n665\n00:32:37.077 --> 00:32:39.261\nonly really two responsibilities we have,\n\n666\n00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:41.629\nare to make sure we can\ndo user administration.\n\n667\n00:32:41.629 --> 00:32:46.096\nSo provisioning of user's access control\nwith regards to the access on the front\n\n668\n00:32:46.096 --> 00:32:46.894\nend for data.\n\n669\n00:32:46.894 --> 00:32:49.644\nAnd then providing the data\nin the appropriate form and\n\n670\n00:32:49.644 --> 00:32:53.013\nthrough the interfaces that the vendor and\nthe API allows us to do.\n\n671\n00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:53.845\nAnd so with SaaS,\n\n672\n00:32:53.845 --> 00:32:57.509\nwe're dealing with a third party that's\nmanaging our data on the back-end.\n\n673\n00:32:57.509 --> 00:33:00.632\nWe're gonna give it to them and\nthey're gonna put it into a database.\n\n674\n00:33:00.632 --> 00:33:03.510\nThey're gonna put it into\nsome sort of secure network.\n\n675\n00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:04.760\nWe're probably not going to know, nor\n\n676\n00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.570\nindeed should we know,\nwhat that looks like.\n\n677\n00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.150\nWe don't know if it's block storage.\n\n678\n00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:09.840\nWe don't know if it's object storage.\n\n679\n00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.790\nWe don't know if it is in a database.\n\n680\n00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.180\nWe don't know what form it's in.\n\n681\n00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.220\nWe probably know it's in the database,\nbut we don't really understand the form.\n\n682\n00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.570\nAll we know is we have a web front end,\nsome sort of form, an API.\n\n683\n00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.104\nWe access it through\nan authorized application or\n\n684\n00:33:22.104 --> 00:33:24.892\nsome sort of web interface and\nwe put our data in there.\n\n685\n00:33:24.892 --> 00:33:28.392\nSo, content for file storage,\nephemeral storage,\n\n686\n00:33:28.392 --> 00:33:31.675\ncontent delivery networks,\nlong term storage.\n\n687\n00:33:31.675 --> 00:33:35.565\nThese are all storage types, storage forms\nthat may be associated with SaaS because\n\n688\n00:33:35.565 --> 00:33:39.840\nthe reality is the vendor abstracts all\nthat from us, we just don't really know.\n\n689\n00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.274\nSo if you think about,\nlet's say, Spotify or\n\n690\n00:33:43.274 --> 00:33:47.853\nPandora, or any of these music\nstreaming services, right,\n\n691\n00:33:47.853 --> 00:33:51.656\nthat you may subscribe to,\nright, or you may use.\n\n692\n00:33:51.656 --> 00:33:55.081\nYou're essentially renting\nsoftware as a service, right?\n\n693\n00:33:55.081 --> 00:33:57.110\nSo you're consuming data.\n\n694\n00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:59.070\nBut you don't really know\nwhere the data comes from,\n\n695\n00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:02.030\nyou don't really know where the data\nlives, you don't know where it's managed.\n\n696\n00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.770\nAnd so in these services, you're just\nstreaming music down to your endpoints,\n\n697\n00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.480\nyour music player, your web interface\non your laptop, in your car,\n\n698\n00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.630\nwhatever it may be.\n\n699\n00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:14.320\nAnd you're consuming that data, music\nessentially is just bits of information\n\n700\n00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.350\nthat's streaming across a network, but\ndo we know where the data comes from?\n\n701\n00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:22.180\nI mean, yes we know, Pandora's providing\nit and you're listening to channel five or\n\n702\n00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:25.310\nwhatever it is, right, but\ndo we really know where that data lives?\n\n703\n00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.050\nDo we know what data\ncenter it's coming out of?\n\n704\n00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.790\nDo we know what database it's on?\n\n705\n00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.340\nDo we know what storage array it's in?\n\n706\n00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.650\nDo we know what form it's in?\n\n707\n00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.060\nWe have no idea, nor do we care.\n\n708\n00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:35.274\nAll we want is that we know\nthat when we turn it on,\n\n709\n00:34:35.274 --> 00:34:37.977\nwe're able to listen to whatever\nthe band is that you like or\n\n710\n00:34:37.977 --> 00:34:39.944\nwhatever that mix is\nthat you want to hear.\n\n711\n00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:41.905\nSo this is really what software\nas a service does, right?\n\n712\n00:34:41.905 --> 00:34:45.513\nIt's abstracting everything and just\nproviding that general level of access to\n\n713\n00:34:45.513 --> 00:34:48.230\nus and we're not really thinking\nabout where it comes from.\n\n714\n00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:50.010\nWe're just thinking about\nhow we can consume it,\n\n715\n00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.390\nand making sure we get what we need.\n\n716\n00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.610\nData dispersion in the cloud\nis also very important, right?\n\n717\n00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:57.660\nData being put into different places,\n\n718\n00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.640\nmanaged in different ways,\nbecomes very important as well.\n\n719\n00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:04.382\nWe have lots of different data dispersion\ntechniques that can be used for high\n\n720\n00:35:04.382 --> 00:35:08.598\navailability, for data resiliency, for\nmaking sure that we optimize performance.\n\n721\n00:35:08.598 --> 00:35:12.941\nWe have to understand that, when we\ndo data dispersion, we are thinking\n\n722\n00:35:12.941 --> 00:35:17.140\nabout the fact that we are gonna chunk\ndata up into some sort of blocks or\n\n723\n00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:18.297\nsegments of data.\n\n724\n00:35:18.297 --> 00:35:20.840\nAnd we're then gonna mange those blocks.\n\n725\n00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.070\nWe may use erasure coding to be able to\ntag the data and understand where it is.\n\n726\n00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.350\nWe may use bit dispersal to\nbe able to essentially say,\n\n727\n00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.590\nthis group of data goes over\nhere in this data store.\n\n728\n00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.970\nThis group of data goes\nover here in this one.\n\n729\n00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:36.024\nAnd this group of data goes\nover here in that one.\n\n730\n00:35:36.024 --> 00:35:40.001\nAnd as a result, when we separate the data\nand we spread it around, it's harder,\n\n731\n00:35:40.001 --> 00:35:42.149\nnumber one, for\nthe bad actors to get to it.\n\n732\n00:35:42.149 --> 00:35:44.730\nCuz they have to go to multiple\nplaces to bring it back.\n\n733\n00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.225\nAnd they have to know where in\nthose multiple places the data is.\n\n734\n00:35:48.225 --> 00:35:51.305\nIt's the proverbial needle in the\nhaystack, but it's multiple needles and\n\n735\n00:35:51.305 --> 00:35:54.185\nmultiple haystacks\ngeographically dispersed but yet\n\n736\n00:35:54.185 --> 00:35:57.375\nall linked together by a common\nunderlying carrier architecture.\n\n737\n00:35:57.375 --> 00:36:01.425\nAnd because we can pull the data in\nacross that carrier network in real time,\n\n738\n00:36:01.425 --> 00:36:04.820\nwe can reassemble the data from\nthe various storage locations.\n\n739\n00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.369\nIt's much more secure when\nwe do data dispersion.\n\n740\n00:36:07.369 --> 00:36:13.552\nSo we have to think as as a security\nmindset along these lines, as a CCSP.\n\n741\n00:36:13.552 --> 00:36:17.355\nWe have to think about where our data\nlives, what types of storage technologies\n\n742\n00:36:17.355 --> 00:36:20.817\ndo we bring bare and under what conditions\ndo we want to access storage and\n\n743\n00:36:20.817 --> 00:36:22.950\nas a result, how do we control storage.\n\n744\n00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:24.531\nBecause these are the questions,\n\n745\n00:36:24.531 --> 00:36:27.700\nthese are the concerns that should\nbe on the mind of the CCSP.\n\n746\n00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.500\nWhen you go into a scenario where you may\nbe asked questions about how you secure\n\n747\n00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.440\nyour data, either in the real world\nwhen you're talking to a customer,\n\n748\n00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.100\nI get asked this all the time.\n\n749\n00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.710\nOr in hypothetically an exam scenario,\nwhere you may be asked or\n\n750\n00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.090\ngiven a scenario, asked to figure\nout the best answer to the question.\n\n751\n00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:45.225\nYou have to understand your options,\nright?\n\n752\n00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:47.738\nYou'll always be prepared\nis what the Boy Scouts say.\n\n753\n00:36:47.738 --> 00:36:50.450\nAnd if you're prepared, you may be able\nto then react to whatever situation\n\n754\n00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.280\nyou find yourself in and\ncome up with the appropriate answer.\n\n755\n00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.480\nThis is what we need to do.\n\n756\n00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:55.940\nThis is how we prepare.\n\n757\n00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.860\nWe understand the different storage types.\n\n758\n00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:00.830\nAnd we understand the options\navailable to us given the scenario.\n\n759\n00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:04.460\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe then make the most appropriate choice.\n\n760\n00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.350\n>> Well Adam,\nyou've really laid out the fact that,\n\n761\n00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:09.080\nit's not that we tend to think of it in,\nwell there's my data.\n\n762\n00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.040\nIt's right there.\n\n763\n00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.600\nIt's on that drive.\n\n764\n00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.180\nBut when you start working in the cloud,\nit's not as simple as that.\n\n765\n00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.320\nHow do we access the data?\n\n766\n00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.310\nWhat type of data is it, or what kind of\nstorage are you using to access that data?\n\n767\n00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.100\nIf you don't understand what those are,\nyou're gonna have a real hard time coming\n\n768\n00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.950\nup with a solution for securing those\nways in which they store that data.\n\n769\n00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:32.758\nSo is there anything else that\nwe need to cover when it comes\n\n770\n00:37:32.758 --> 00:37:35.024\nto the storage types in the cloud?\n\n771\n00:37:35.024 --> 00:37:36.057\n>> There's always more we have to cover.\n\n772\n00:37:36.057 --> 00:37:37.497\n>> [LAUGH] There's always more.\n\n773\n00:37:37.497 --> 00:37:39.880\n>> The cloud is all knowing,\nall seeing and all pervasive.\n\n774\n00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.290\nThere's always more but, we are gonna\ncome back and do that in another episode.\n\n775\n00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.360\n>> Awesome, well thanks for\nstopping by today Adam,\n\n776\n00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.310\nwe appreciate you explaining\nthese concepts to us.\n\n777\n00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:52.050\nWe thank you guys for watching but we're\ngonna go ahead and sign off for ITProTV.\n\n778\n00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:53.601\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n779\n00:37:53.601 --> 00:37:55.597\n>> I'm blob level storage.\n\n780\n00:37:55.597 --> 00:37:57.548\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n781\n00:37:57.548 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.710\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrey, and today's\nepisode, that's right, we're continuing\n\n4\n00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.750\nforward with our certified cloud\nsecurity professional series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.900\nJoining us back in the studios again\ntoday to help us along with that very\n\n6\n00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.750\nendeavor and lend his expertise on that\ntopic is our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.990\nAdam welcome back and how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.143\n>> I have no expertise and\nI lend it to nobody.\n\n9\n00:00:34.143 --> 00:00:35.298\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm very selfish in that respect.\n\n10\n00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:36.456\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Keeps it all to himself.\n\n11\n00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:37.450\nI'm keeping it all to myself.\n\n12\n00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.610\nIt is going well, it is going well.\n\n13\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.996\nHopefully all of you out there\nare having a cloudtastic day.\n\n14\n00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:47.170\n[COUGH] So you know I totally\nrandom aside for just a minute,\n\n15\n00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.920\nas I sometimes do, as you will know if you\nwatch our episodes on a regular basis.\n\n16\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.710\nSo I'm not in the habit of eating\nfast food on a regular basis.\n\n17\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.870\nBut every so often you're stuck and\nyou may go through a drive through and\n\n18\n00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.910\nwhatever, so I happen to pull\nthrough a drive through in Taco Bell\n\n19\n00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.030\nwhen I got into town to actually come and\nspend time with you guys this week.\n\n20\n00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.680\nIt was late at night, there really\nweren't a lot of options, and so\n\n21\n00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.480\nas you know there's one not too far\ndown the road from our lovely studio.\n\n22\n00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.610\nAnd so I stopped I went through and\ngot some stuff.\n\n23\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.740\nAnd as I pulled up and exchanged money for\n\n24\n00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.940\nthe bag of goodies that\nTaco Bell was providing.\n\n25\n00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.730\nThe nice young lady who took care\nof me said hey, here's your stuff,\n\n26\n00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.460\nthank you very much and\nhave nacho-tastic evening.\n\n27\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.650\nWow that was really random and\n\n28\n00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.700\nkind of scary,-\n>> She has,-\n\n29\n00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.470\n>> But you know, have a cloud-tastic day.\n\n30\n00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.780\n>> The best customer service\nat that place that you\n\n31\n00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.290\never,-\n>> They\n\n32\n00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.790\nactually were,-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.370\n>> Incredibly nice,\n\n34\n00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.160\nall kidding aside and it was a very\ninteresting experience cuz she was so\n\n35\n00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.490\nnice as a matter of fact that\nshe caught me off guard.\n\n36\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.770\nI wasn't expecting to told I should\nhave a nacho-tastic evening, so\n\n37\n00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.030\nI didn't know how to respond,\ncuz I was caught off guard and\n\n38\n00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.925\nI didn't have my Mexican analogy handbook\nhandy, and I wasn't sure what to say.\n\n39\n00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:51.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I just smiled politely, and\n\n40\n00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.570\nI said thank you, and\nI went along my merry way.\n\n41\n00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.800\nBut don't have a nacho-tastic day,\nhave a cloud-tastic day,\n\n42\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.230\nthat's what we want you to do here\nat ITProTV, cuz we are the cloud.\n\n43\n00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.856\nSo let's talk about threats to storage\ntypes cuz we are talking about storage,\n\n44\n00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:08.463\nwe have been talking about\nstorage in our prior episode.\n\n45\n00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:12.207\nWe wanna make sure we continue that\nthought process with regards to the cloud\n\n46\n00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:14.839\ndata security and\narchitectures around security and\n\n47\n00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.191\nthe things we have to do\nwith CCSPs to be secure.\n\n48\n00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.395\nAnd so when we think about storage types\nand if you remember in our last episode\n\n49\n00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:23.843\nand, by the way, if you have not seen that\none, before you're watching this one,\n\n50\n00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.331\nit would be good idea for\nyou to go back and watch that first.\n\n51\n00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:31.175\nWe identify the different kinds of storage\ntypes associated with IS, PAS and SaaS.\n\n52\n00:02:31.175 --> 00:02:33.327\nAnd I'm gonna reference\nthat conversation but\n\n53\n00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:36.404\nI want you to have a point of reference or\npoint of connection for it.\n\n54\n00:02:36.404 --> 00:02:39.637\nWhen we think about storage types,\nand for instance we take IAS, and\n\n55\n00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:42.593\nwe think about object storage or\nwe think about block storage,\n\n56\n00:02:42.593 --> 00:02:46.218\nwe have to understand that depending on\nthe type of storage we are mounting and\n\n57\n00:02:46.218 --> 00:02:50.065\nusing, we may have different threats,\nthat as a security professional we have to\n\n58\n00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:52.650\nentertain, and contend with,\nand deal with.\n\n59\n00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.480\nAnd so we have to be aware of\nthe storage architecture to really\n\n60\n00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.520\ndo our job properly.\n\n61\n00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520\nIt's very, very important for\n\n62\n00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.150\nus, because if we are in control directly\nof the storage architecture, it's a very\n\n63\n00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.240\ndifferent conversation about security\nthan in a SaaS model where the vendor is.\n\n64\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.866\nAnd all we do is simply put our data into\nthe mystical API or mystical application\n\n65\n00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:15.228\nthat ports our data and we really see\nnothing about the data on the back end.\n\n66\n00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:15.890\nWe don't know anything about it.\n\n67\n00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.051\nWe don't know the architecture.\n\n68\n00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:20.466\nWe don't know what's happening,\nwe are relying on the cloud provider to\n\n69\n00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.053\ndo all that for us, so\nit is essentially a black box, and\n\n70\n00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:25.710\nwe don't really understand\nwhat goes on in there.\n\n71\n00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.740\nSo threats to storage types are relevant\nto the storage architecture, and\n\n72\n00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.620\nas a CCSP, we may or may not have a lot\nto say about how we contend with them.\n\n73\n00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.540\nWe may just simply have to say, hey guess\nwhat we gotta talk to the cloud storage\n\n74\n00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.720\nprovider, or we have to talk to the cloud\nSaaS provider, cuz we're not sure and\n\n75\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.650\nit's their responsibility to manage that.\n\n76\n00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.190\nOr hey, your talking to the right person\ncuz guess what, I control all that and\n\n77\n00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.080\nwe can go figure that out.\n\n78\n00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.470\nAll right, so we have to know that.\n\n79\n00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.470\nSo unauthorized usage is\nalways at the top of any list\n\n80\n00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.220\nwith regards to storage access and\nstorage types with regards to threats.\n\n81\n00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.020\nUnauthorized usage, unauthorized access,\nkind of two sides of same coin.\n\n82\n00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.890\nWe tend to have both\nhappen at the same time.\n\n83\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.280\nIf you wanna engage in unauthorized usage,\n\n84\n00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.670\nyou typically, not always,\nwill engage in unauthorized access cuz\n\n85\n00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.590\nlegitimate users try to use resources\nin inappropriate ways all the time.\n\n86\n00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.170\nBut we tend to see both of\nthese happening together.\n\n87\n00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.810\nA liability due to regulatory\nnoncompliance, we have storage that should\n\n88\n00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.680\nbe managed a certain way, should be\nretained for a certain period of time,\n\n89\n00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.940\nshould be classified in a certain manner,\nand we're not doing that.\n\n90\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.030\nSo from a regulatory perspective,\nwe may have concerns.\n\n91\n00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.650\nDenial of service or distribute a denial\nof service solution, right or attacks and\n\n92\n00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.010\nvectors we have to contend with.\n\n93\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.110\nWe may have bad actors internally\nexecuting these attacks and\n\n94\n00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.360\nwe may have bad actors externally securing\nthese attacks that we have to worry\n\n95\n00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.360\nabout these things.\n\n96\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.270\nCorruption and\n\n97\n00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.640\nor loss of accessing the indestruction\nof data, as a result of corruption.\n\n98\n00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.860\nSo availability related concerns.\n\n99\n00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.310\nData leakage and or breaches.\n\n100\n00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.600\nData's exposed,\nconfidentiality is breached.\n\n101\n00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.030\nWe have to worry about that.\n\n102\n00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.960\nThreat of accidental loss of media.\n\n103\n00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.570\nSomebody's transporting data.\n\n104\n00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.070\nThey lose it.\n\n105\n00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.560\nIt then becomes compromised\nif somebody else finds it.\n\n106\n00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.700\nThis happens all the time.\n\n107\n00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.300\nMalware attacks or\nintroduction to malware, or trojans, or\n\n108\n00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.890\nsome sort of virus or worm, or\nwhatever it may be, into the network and\n\n109\n00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.360\nby extension into\nthe storage architecture.\n\n110\n00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.250\nThis can happen if we're not careful.\n\n111\n00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.840\nJust because data's archived doesn't\nmean that don't have malware\n\n112\n00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.260\nsitting in the archived data.\n\n113\n00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.560\nIt just means that the data's\nin long term storage, and\n\n114\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.410\nwhen you go to pull the data back,\nif there is an active piece of malware or\n\n115\n00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.030\na virus or a concern there, that could\nbecome active again on the network.\n\n116\n00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.000\nWe see this happening.\n\n117\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.100\nAlthough not very often,\nbut we do see it happening.\n\n118\n00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.100\nOne of the easiest ways to deal with this\nis simply to make sure we're scanning\n\n119\n00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.640\nactively the archive storage systems and\nlooking for viruses, looking for malware.\n\n120\n00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.550\nWe scan everything coming in and\ngoing out.\n\n121\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.220\nAnd if we're actively doing that, then we\ncan eliminate a lot of these concerns,\n\n122\n00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.990\nnot totally eliminate them but\nwe can certainly reduce them right.\n\n123\n00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.350\nAnd that's something to consider.\n\n124\n00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.920\nImproper treatment of sanitized\ndata after end of use.\n\n125\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.190\nWe go to delete datas.\n\n126\n00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.825\nWe talked about it in a prior episode.\n\n127\n00:05:52.825 --> 00:05:54.195\nWe don't do it correctly.\n\n128\n00:05:54.195 --> 00:05:57.185\nAnd as a result of that,\ndata remnants are left behind and\n\n129\n00:05:57.185 --> 00:05:59.075\nthe data remnants can then be recovered.\n\n130\n00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.395\nSo these are all threats that we\nwould have to contend with and\n\n131\n00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:02.415\nbe concerned about.\n\n132\n00:06:02.415 --> 00:06:06.565\nThe trick here, from the CCSP's\nperspective, is to constantly remember and\n\n133\n00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:09.385\nunderstand that we have to keep\nthe thought process in our\n\n134\n00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:12.045\nheads at all times of relevancy,\nright, and context.\n\n135\n00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:13.685\nAnd we come back to this\ntheme fairly often.\n\n136\n00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.690\nRight tools, right job.\n\n137\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.020\nSo, if we have sensitive data, we have to\nhave the appropriate tools available to us\n\n138\n00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.100\nto make sure that data is protected and\n\n139\n00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.030\nthat it is secured\nthroughout the life cycle.\n\n140\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.600\nIf we have data that's relativity insecure\nthat is classified as being really not all\n\n141\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.680\nthat important, we still need\nstrong tools to manage it but\n\n142\n00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.390\nit may not require the same kind of\ntools as sensitive or confidential data.\n\n143\n00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.550\nSo I'll give you an example\nof data classification.\n\n144\n00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.540\nWe probably are very used to the idea\nof things like top secret, eyes only.\n\n145\n00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.160\nWe see these kinds of classifications,\nhear about them in movies,\n\n146\n00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.630\nread about them in books,\nthings of that nature.\n\n147\n00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.720\nAnd these are pretty standard\nclassification systems, right?\n\n148\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.050\nFOUO if you are in the military or\nthe government, For Official Use Only,\n\n149\n00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.750\nis something you would be\nfamiliar with as an example.\n\n150\n00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.760\nTop Secret Eyes Only, as I've said.\n\n151\n00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.190\nThese are traditionally government and\nmilitary classifications schemes.\n\n152\n00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.960\nHave you ever heard of, I'll ask you,\nDaniel, I'll bring you back in and\n\n153\n00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.130\nask you this.\n\n154\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.680\nAre you familiar with NATO?\n\n155\n00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.960\n>> Yes, whose not?\n\n156\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.543\n>> Okay, so-\n>> [CROSSTALK] Well maybe there\n\n157\n00:07:12.543 --> 00:07:14.033\nare people who may or not be right.\n\n158\n00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:15.613\nBut pretty common as an acronym right.\n\n159\n00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:19.340\nSo the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\n160\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.160\nThe military and\ngovernmental alliance that the US and\n\n161\n00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.645\nEurope has been involved with\nsince the second world war.\n\n162\n00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:27.321\nSo NATO has kinda an extra\ngovernment organization,\n\n163\n00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:31.545\nhas it's own classification scheme and\nis military government centric.\n\n164\n00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:34.269\nAnd so, they don't just use\ntop secret things like that,\n\n165\n00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:38.120\nthey actually have several data\nclassification categories above that.\n\n166\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.340\nThere's a classification category, they're\ncalled cosmic, which actually is a top\n\n167\n00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.230\nsecret plus plus classification that goes\nabove top secret for ultra sensitive data.\n\n168\n00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.420\nSo there may be unique\nclassification schemes.\n\n169\n00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.621\nCosmic I thought was pretty cool\nwhen I heard about that one,\n\n170\n00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:53.832\nlike to the stars and back,\nthat's kind of cool right.\n\n171\n00:07:53.832 --> 00:07:57.093\nSo cosmic would be an example\nof data classification.\n\n172\n00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:59.498\nUnderstanding the nature of the threat,\nunderstanding and\n\n173\n00:07:59.498 --> 00:08:02.580\napplying the appropriate technology\nto mitigate that threat is important.\n\n174\n00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.220\nClassification is not a technology in and\nof itself, but it is an enabler of other\n\n175\n00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.588\ntechnology that allows us to apply\nthe appropriate solution to the data, so\n\n176\n00:08:11.588 --> 00:08:12.630\nwe can secure it.\n\n177\n00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.180\nBecause if we don't classify data,\nit is very hard for\n\n178\n00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.000\nus to choose the appropriate technology\nto ensure that we are safeguarding data\n\n179\n00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.850\nusing the proper protection mechanism.\n\n180\n00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.520\nSo, as CCSPs we have to understand data\nrelevancy and understand context and\n\n181\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.880\nclassification helps us to do that.\n\n182\n00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.536\nData loss prevention, DLP technology,\n\n183\n00:08:30.536 --> 00:08:35.320\ncommonly used to be able to scan in line\nin real time data streams coming, and\n\n184\n00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.300\ngoing through our networks,\nalso scanning data at rest,\n\n185\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.370\ndata in storage, data in use,\nand data in transit on the wire.\n\n186\n00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:44.920\nWe are looking for\nessentially a pattern match.\n\n187\n00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.810\nRight?\nWe are going to and\n\n188\n00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.690\nsaying is there an account number?\n\n189\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.000\nIs there a sort of security number?\n\n190\n00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.878\nIs there a reference to patient data?\n\n191\n00:08:51.878 --> 00:08:56.930\nIs there a information item that is on a\nblack list of some kind of exclusion list.\n\n192\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.230\nAnd then pattern matching allows\nus to tag that information,\n\n193\n00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.810\npull it out of the stream, and restrict\nthe message flow in order to do that.\n\n194\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.520\nWe could scan both encrypted and\nnon-encrypted formats.\n\n195\n00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.300\nWe may have to load encryption keys\ninto the DLP stream in real time so\n\n196\n00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.630\nwe tend to use hardware\naccelerators to do this.\n\n197\n00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.720\nIt may be a combination of software and\nhardware-based technologies.\n\n198\n00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.680\nBut we can un-encrypt and\n\n199\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.420\nre-encrypt the data stream if necessary\nwith the appropriate technologies.\n\n200\n00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.320\nBut we essentially\nare scanning every message,\n\n201\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.260\nevery piece of data that goes through\nthe system, plus attachments,\n\n202\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.830\nvery important to think about that,\nto look for this pattern match.\n\n203\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.290\nAnd then remove the data\nthat may be offending us,\n\n204\n00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.820\nthat we may not wanna send out.\n\n205\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.190\nSo it's a very effective\nway to deal with PII,\n\n206\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.694\nPersonally Identifiable Information\nconcerns.\n\n207\n00:09:38.694 --> 00:09:41.450\nYou in the banking industry in financial\nservices industry and the healthcare\n\n208\n00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:46.060\nindustry and the bio pharma industries we\nare using DLP technology all the time.\n\n209\n00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:52.090\nBe able to ensure the data that is of a\nsensitive nature, is intellectual property\n\n210\n00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:57.158\noriented, is patient record data, things\nof that nature, is not being compromised.\n\n211\n00:09:57.158 --> 00:10:01.160\nIs not gonna have confidentiality concerns\nassociated with it, because we're exposing\n\n212\n00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.500\nit, but also because we don't want to\nhave the liable associated, right?\n\n213\n00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.080\nWith removing that data from the system,\nunder conditions that may be questionable,\n\n214\n00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.830\nor at least allowing it to exit the system\nunder conditions that may be questionable.\n\n215\n00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.340\nWhat are the components\nthat make up a DLP system?\n\n216\n00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.110\nWe're gonna have a discovery and\nclassification capabilities.\n\n217\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.980\nWe're gonna have monitoring capabilities.\n\n218\n00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.930\nWe're gonna have enforcement capabilities.\n\n219\n00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.430\nAs a CCSP, it'd be very important for\nyou to understand the concept of DLP but\n\n220\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.162\nalso understand the building blocks or\ncomponents that make it up.\n\n221\n00:10:28.162 --> 00:10:33.580\nSo discovering classification is all\nabout making sure that we are able to\n\n222\n00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.000\nfigure out, as we talked about with data\nclassification, what kind of data is gonna\n\n223\n00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.140\nbe appropriate for us to pay attention to,\nwhat kind of data we don't care about.\n\n224\n00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.600\nNot because its not important, but because\nits not on the block or exclusion list.\n\n225\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.630\nSo we have to be able to classify, and\nthen we have to be able to introspect.\n\n226\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.940\nWe have to be able to discover.\n\n227\n00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.990\nActually examine the data streams.\n\n228\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.400\nWe have to monitor,\nconstantly and consistently.\n\n229\n00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.320\nSo as I said, in line in realtime, looking\nat data flows inbound and outbound.\n\n230\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.020\nThis may be a common choke point, so\na gateway devices like IDSs or IPSs or\n\n231\n00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.960\nrouters or firewalls, we may be doing this\ninline through a specific choke point in\n\n232\n00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.860\nthe architecture, so we may put a rack\nmounted device in and move all data flows\n\n233\n00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.180\nthrough that particular device because\nit monitors everything on the switch.\n\n234\n00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.060\nAnd all VLANs and associated\nconnection points are monitored through\n\n235\n00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:19.870\na port mirror of some kind on a switch.\n\n236\n00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.320\nThere's different ways to do that.\n\n237\n00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.110\nSometimes called a spam port,\nsometimes called a port marriage,\n\n238\n00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:26.710\ndepends on the technology and\nhow you implement it.\n\n239\n00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.210\nBut we're monitoring them, right?\n\n240\n00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.020\nAnd by the way, these can be virtualized\ndevices or physical devices.\n\n241\n00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.590\nSo you may run this as\na virtualized instance.\n\n242\n00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.410\nSome sort of VM or appliance.\n\n243\n00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.740\nOr it may be a physical item\nthat's actually running.\n\n244\n00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.750\nOr it could be a Cloud service,\n\n245\n00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.290\nyou actually consume DLP\nthrough a Cloud service.\n\n246\n00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.080\nSo on Microsoft's Office 365 platform.\n\n247\n00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:48.500\nIf you have an enterprise level license,\nor the equivalent on the government side,\n\n248\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.460\nso like an E3-E4 or G3 license,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n249\n00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.800\nYou've got DLP technology built right in\nto the Cloud platform for exchange, and\n\n250\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.930\nyou can actually monitor the traffic\nflow through the mail system using DLP\n\n251\n00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.810\ntechnology in line,\nright in the Cloud environment itself.\n\n252\n00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.080\nSo you're able to consume that as\na service, essentially through SAS as part\n\n253\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.980\nof the application or\nas part of the use of that system.\n\n254\n00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.090\nAnd then we have enforcement.\n\n255\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.490\nThese are the three categories or\nareas of the DOP components.\n\n256\n00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:17.590\nRemember, enforcement is going to be the\nability to interdict, pull the data out,\n\n257\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.850\nstop the message from being sent,\nflag the message, probably re-route it,\n\n258\n00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.800\npark it somewhere and quarantine it.\n\n259\n00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.960\nAnd then typically alert\nthe administrative oversight function.\n\n260\n00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.530\nHey there's been a violation.\n\n261\n00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:30.900\nRight?\nSomebody sent this message.\n\n262\n00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.680\nAnd we have to go investigate and\nfigure out what that is.\n\n263\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.850\nSo this could be a network based\nimplementation as I mentioned.\n\n264\n00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:37.970\nIt could be storage based.\n\n265\n00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.710\nWe look at it and scan storage so data at\nrest, data on the wire and client base,\n\n266\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:43.730\ndata in use.\n\n267\n00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.700\nWe see DLP technology\nexisting in all three areas.\n\n268\n00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.230\nAnd again, as a CCSP, you wanna have\na knowledge of, wanna understand,\n\n269\n00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:55.040\nand be aware of the fact that DLP\ntechnology exists at all three areas or\n\n270\n00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.870\nall three states that data can exist in.\n\n271\n00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:01.530\nOn the wire, at rest, and in use,\nright, or what we call network based,\n\n272\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.468\nstorage based, and client based DLP,\nso make sure you're aware of that.\n\n273\n00:13:05.468 --> 00:13:09.556\nCloud based DLP, as I mentioned is\navailable, we use it all the time.\n\n274\n00:13:09.556 --> 00:13:13.390\nData moves very very quickly and very\nfrequently through the Cloud, so it moves,\n\n275\n00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.620\nit replicates, it is scattered in\nmultiple places, through bit dispersion,\n\n276\n00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.610\nas we talked about.\n\n277\n00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.030\nSo we have to understand this.\n\n278\n00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.610\nEnterprise administrative access can\nbe compromised and very very difficult\n\n279\n00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.670\nto achieve and maintain across the entire\nCloud architecture because the vendor\n\n280\n00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.600\nmay control parts of that, we may\ncontrol parts of it as the customer.\n\n281\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.180\nIt may be hard for us to understand that\ntotally, so DLP is a good option for\n\n282\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:35.980\nus in the Cloud.\n\n283\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.480\nIt's a good thing for us to have access\nto because it simplifies our ability to\n\n284\n00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.110\nmanage, monitor and maintain enforcement\nand control over the data stream.\n\n285\n00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.940\nIt's very important for\n\n286\n00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.610\nus to look for Cloud services where we\nmay be able to take advantage of this.\n\n287\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.850\nIt's one of the leading edge technologies\nthat we're seeing more and more, right?\n\n288\n00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:54.990\nSo think about things like what kind of\ndata are you gonna permit on the Cloud.\n\n289\n00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.870\nAre you gonna put this proprietary\ndata that's linked to IP,\n\n290\n00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.730\nto intellectual property, in the Cloud.\n\n291\n00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.650\nIf so, how are you gonna protect it.\n\n292\n00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:06.130\nAs a CCSP, you may be asked to wrestle\nwith this exact question by a customer.\n\n293\n00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:09.180\nYou may be asked by the business to decide\nwhether or not it's a good idea for\n\n294\n00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.180\nus to put our intellectual\nproperty up in the Cloud, and\n\n295\n00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.010\nthen how are we gonna safeguard it?\n\n296\n00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:14.980\nHow are we going to or\n\n297\n00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.290\nwhat are we gonna deal with regards\nto data jurisdiction, right?\n\n298\n00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:19.710\nSo where does data live?\n\n299\n00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:21.820\nWhat jurisdictions will\ndata be governed by?\n\n300\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.460\nWe wrestled with this conversation\nin one of our early episodes, right?\n\n301\n00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.110\nWhere we talked about\nthe overview of Cloud security,\n\n302\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:32.890\nand we talked about the fact that where\ndata lives is where data is managed.\n\n303\n00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:36.410\nAnd as a result of jurisdiction of\nthe data, it's really limited to and\n\n304\n00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.930\nreally seen as being appropriate for\n\n305\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.550\nthe geography of the data\nis going to existent.\n\n306\n00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.050\nIf that data moves from multiple\ngeographies on a path being sent from\n\n307\n00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.610\npoint A to point B to point C and\nultimately out to point D depending on\n\n308\n00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.210\nwhere we stop that data where we interdict\nit where we examine it, it may be subject\n\n309\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.780\nto different laws, different requirements,\ndifferent concerns.\n\n310\n00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:58.700\nAnd if the data doesn't make the whole\njourney cuz somebody interdicts it and\n\n311\n00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.220\nstops it along the way, that may be\nthe place where we decide whether or\n\n312\n00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.970\nnot that data is legal and\nif it is, great.\n\n313\n00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.520\nIf not, we may have a problem,\nas a result of that, right?\n\n314\n00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.990\nSo, you have to be very careful, as we\ntalked about in those early episodes,\n\n315\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.045\nabout where your data is at all times.\n\n316\n00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:16.710\nNot just where it is at rest, but where it\nis in use, and where it is storage, right,\n\n317\n00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:18.490\nat rest, as well as in transit.\n\n318\n00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.450\nIt's really in transit where we tend\nto run into issues because data may\n\n319\n00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.900\nbe moving in through multiple\njurisdictions between in use and\n\n320\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.450\nstorage, and it's that movement\nthat we have to be concerned with.\n\n321\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.990\nWe talked about geopreference and\nthe idea of building geopreference hosting\n\n322\n00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.670\ninto your data thought process as a CCSP\nto offset and compensate for this.\n\n323\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:42.630\nIt's very, very important what we would\nrefer to or call a compensated mechanism,\n\n324\n00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.710\nor a compensating control,\nbecause we have to offset the fact\n\n325\n00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:49.290\nthe data should not be moving outside\nof our jurisdictional boundaries.\n\n326\n00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.367\nAnd so as I mentioned,\ngovernments especially,\n\n327\n00:15:51.367 --> 00:15:54.700\nare building geo-preference clauses\ninto their data hosting regimes.\n\n328\n00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.980\nWe have to be aware of that.\n\n329\n00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.190\nHow should the data be stored?\n\n330\n00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:58.130\nWill we use encryption?\n\n331\n00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.667\nIf so, what kind of encryption?\n\n332\n00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.773\nWe have different options,\nright, different strengths,\n\n333\n00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:03.810\ndifferent technologies\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n334\n00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.886\nAre we going to not just\nfocus on encryption, but\n\n335\n00:16:06.886 --> 00:16:11.330\nfocus on the physical security of\nthe data in the storage array.\n\n336\n00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.680\nSo who has rights on it from the back\nend from the cloud service providers\n\n337\n00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.550\nperspective.\n\n338\n00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.390\nAre those people going\nto be securely vetted?\n\n339\n00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.052\nAre they going to be background checked?\n\n340\n00:16:20.052 --> 00:16:21.840\nDo they have a proper security clearance?\n\n341\n00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.633\nIn high security data centers,\nyou can actually request, and\n\n342\n00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:27.848\nyou can be given the ability to have\na certain level of security clearance\n\n343\n00:16:27.848 --> 00:16:31.530\napplied to the people that see and\ninteract with your technology.\n\n344\n00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:34.830\nYou pay a premium for this of course but\nin secure hosting environments\n\n345\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.590\nthis is traditionally done and everybody\nmay be cleared at a certain level.\n\n346\n00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.420\nWe'll have appropriate background\nchecks we'll whatever that\n\n347\n00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.140\nparticular level may be depending\non what you're paying for.\n\n348\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.510\nI have many customers who host and secure\ndata, a centers data hosting environments,\n\n349\n00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.860\nwhere a standard military\nbackground check,\n\n350\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.720\nthe level of that background\ncheck essentially is required.\n\n351\n00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.810\nAnd you have to have a security clearance\nin order to be able to essentially work on\n\n352\n00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.870\nthat team and be involved with that data.\n\n353\n00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.970\nSo that's not uncommon by any means, and\n\n354\n00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.760\nthat is something that we do wanna\nthink about and want to be aware of.\n\n355\n00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.990\nSo that may be a requirement, maybe\nan option for us, and this as a CCSP,\n\n356\n00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.580\nwe'd want to think about whether or\n\n357\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.290\nnot that'd be on our checklist right,\nof things we may want to specify.\n\n358\n00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.990\nWhat kind of data access is permitted?\n\n359\n00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.680\nI didn't mean to cut you off.\n\n360\n00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.600\nWere you gonna say something?\n\n361\n00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.060\n>> No.\n>> Okay, because you made that motion\n\n362\n00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.450\nlike you were about to say something.\n\n363\n00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.340\n>> I'll wait for\nyou to find a nice pause, but-\n\n364\n00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.200\n>> Well, we could pause right here.\n\n365\n00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.330\n>> Well, what I was thinking about is\nit really sound like what you're saying\n\n366\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.310\nis this all boils down to\nhere are threats, right?\n\n367\n00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:30.540\nIf you've got data, there are threats to\nthose data, to that data, should I say.\n\n368\n00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:34.760\nAnd what we need to do is figure out\nwhat is the risk and that way we can\n\n369\n00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.510\nimplement a countermeasure for that,\nif my data is more at risk by doing\n\n370\n00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:43.830\na cloud solution that I need to spend\nmore time and effort into classifying and\n\n371\n00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:49.010\nmonitoring excuse me [COUGH] that's my\nthroat trying to choke me on screen.\n\n372\n00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:52.800\nThat's where we need to put our effort and\nthere are greater risks and\n\n373\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.640\nlesser risks and because of that\nthat's how we need to figure it out.\n\n374\n00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.500\nOnce we identify with those, with the\ngreat threats are through risk assessments\n\n375\n00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.950\nthat's how we really going\nto build our strategy.\n\n376\n00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.440\n>> It's definitely gonna be a very\nimportant component of it, right?\n\n377\n00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.010\nSo it's gonna be something\nthat we're gonna make sure\n\n378\n00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.920\nthat we are thinking about.\n\n379\n00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.250\nAnd general reasons and\nexcellent point here, right?\n\n380\n00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.540\nIt is about risk assessment.\n\n381\n00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.930\nThere's no doubt about it,\nin risk management, risk analysis.\n\n382\n00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.670\nBut there's more to it than just that.\n\n383\n00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.990\nAs I said, it's a component.\n\n384\n00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.380\nWe have to take that, and then we have to\nframe that in the context of the business\n\n385\n00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.530\nand the business requirements, right?\n\n386\n00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.180\nBecause as hopefully we know,\n\n387\n00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.520\nhopefully we're aware of\n>> Risk assessment, risk management is\n\n388\n00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.440\na function of identifying concerns,\nand prioritizing their impact and\n\n389\n00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.700\nthe exposure we have, and\nthen understanding how to manage them,\n\n390\n00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.640\nand trade them off against what\nthe business looks to accomplish.\n\n391\n00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.110\nIt's definitely gonna be\npart of that equation.\n\n392\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.670\nBut we may find ourselves in\na position where we're gonna say,\n\n393\n00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.490\nhey you know we know we have a risk but\n\n394\n00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:49.070\nwe're willing to accept that risk in\norder to engage in this activity or\n\n395\n00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:52.210\nwe wanna avoid that risk that's not\nengaged in this activity, right?\n\n396\n00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.940\nOr we're gonna transfer that risk.\n\n397\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:56.420\nWell essentially\n>> Pay somebody right to do it for us so\n\n398\n00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.210\nthat's where the cloud may come in,\nor we may try to mitigate that risk.\n\n399\n00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:05.890\nWe may decide that we want to go ahead and\nsay let's approach this problem this way.\n\n400\n00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.760\nLet's go ahead and essentially apply\nthese controls so it's You know,\n\n401\n00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.220\ntry to get down to the lowest common\ndenominator with regards to risk, but we\n\n402\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.440\ndo want to understand that we are going to\nhave that risk, we are going to manage it.\n\n403\n00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.180\nSo risk sits at the heart of what we're\ndoing, there's no doubt about it.\n\n404\n00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:21.120\nUnder what conditions may data be\nable to transit through the cloud?\n\n405\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.120\nCome and go?\n\n406\n00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.470\nMaybe certain users are authorized, maybe\ncertain times of the day are authorized?\n\n407\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.190\nThere's all these different things\nwe'd want to think about with regards\n\n408\n00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.760\nto this, right?\n\n409\n00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.550\nSo as we're deciding And thinking about\nthe appropriate technologies, but\n\n410\n00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.680\nalso looking at designing and\napplying data security strategies,\n\n411\n00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.210\nwe really have to think about\nthe use of things like DLP.\n\n412\n00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.080\nWe have to think about the risk\nassessment that goes on.\n\n413\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.140\nWe have to think about encryption and\nhow encryption plays into this as well.\n\n414\n00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.130\nWe've mentioned encryption.\n\n415\n00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.410\nThe use of encryption is very important,\nright?\n\n416\n00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.750\nBecause when we're implementing the system\nor putting data into storage, we should\n\n417\n00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.950\nencrypt the data on the back end To ensure\nthat the data is stored securely but\n\n418\n00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:59.400\nalso that we should use encryption on\nthe wire so it's transmitted securely.\n\n419\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.780\nWe should always use encryption in\nthe application so that when data is used,\n\n420\n00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.490\nit is encrypted throughout\nthe entire phasing\n\n421\n00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.270\nof the data across all\nthe areas of the life cycle.\n\n422\n00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.690\nIt would be very important for\nus to think about and\n\n423\n00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.750\nindeed understand,\nthat we should be able to apply data.\n\n424\n00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.150\nAt motion or data in motion.\n\n425\n00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.210\nLet me try that again, we should be able\nto apply encryption to data in motion,\n\n426\n00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.910\nin use and at rest across all\nthree areas of how data exists or\n\n427\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.920\nall three phrases and\nacross all six areas of the life cycle.\n\n428\n00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.440\nRemember we create data, we store data, we\nuse data, we share data, we archive data,\n\n429\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.630\nwe destroy data.\n\n430\n00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.600\nEncryption is appropriate at every level\n\n431\n00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.680\nOf that data life cycle\nin some way some form.\n\n432\n00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.710\nRight?\nWhen we creat that we should be using\n\n433\n00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.350\napplications that are encryption aware and\nthat we could use to\n\n434\n00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.140\nsecure data properly as we create it\nby encrypting it as we're creating it.\n\n435\n00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.464\nSo the data that's created\nimmediately gets encrypted.\n\n436\n00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:50.032\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Adam, when I first got into\n\n437\n00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:53.860\nsecurity one of the buzz phrases was,\nit pays to be paranoid.\n\n438\n00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.940\nIs that what we're saying here,\n\n439\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:59.690\njust encrypt the heck out of everything\nyou can and use that as your safety net?\n\n440\n00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:01.550\n>> It is a very good idea, right?\n\n441\n00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:06.300\nSo, we often think about the fact that\nthe better prepared we are, right, and\n\n442\n00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.140\nthe more prepared we are, ultimately,\n\n443\n00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.570\nthe more likely we are to survive any\nkind of threat that is thrown against us.\n\n444\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.160\nEncryption is one of those Level sets,\n\n445\n00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.320\nset from the security\npractitioner's perspective.\n\n446\n00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.900\nFrom the CCSP's perspective in this case.\n\n447\n00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.950\nThat if we are just holistically across\nthe board applying to every area of\n\n448\n00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.930\nour network or\nevery area of our storage access,\n\n449\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.930\nevery area of our engagement with data or\nin any way, shape or form as we look at\n\n450\n00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:36.480\nthe cloud in every possible area if we\nare applying it It is going to ensure\n\n451\n00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.570\nthat we are less likely to suffer from\nbad actors being able to get to our data.\n\n452\n00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.320\nAnd exposing it and breaching it and\nas a result violating confidentially.\n\n453\n00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.360\nBut also most likely modifying the data.\n\n454\n00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.570\nSo that we have to worry about\nintegrity as well as confidentiality.\n\n455\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.160\nIf data is encrypted it's not\na guarantee that confidentiality and\n\n456\n00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.680\nintegrity will not be violated.\n\n457\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.000\nBut it's a strong indicator\nit's less likely to happen.\n\n458\n00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.590\nSo I don't like to use\nthe concept of being paranoid.\n\n459\n00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.390\nSo I think that, in many cases,\n\n460\n00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.080\ncarries a negative connotation\nwhen we talk about it that way.\n\n461\n00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:08.230\nBut I think it is healthy for\nus to be risk adverse.\n\n462\n00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:12.210\nAnd as a result of that, I think it's very\nimportant, as security professionals For\n\n463\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.370\nus to think about what we can do to\nenhance our ability to manage risk and\n\n464\n00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.700\ncontrol those things that we\nknow potentially may occur.\n\n465\n00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.650\nAnd encryption is a very good\nexample of one of those things that,\n\n466\n00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.220\napplied liberally,\ncan stew very very quickly,\n\n467\n00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:31.710\nmake it a lot harder for those people\nthat are looking to do us harm to do so\n\n468\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.140\nin a way that will actually\nbe problematic for us.\n\n469\n00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.410\nIt forces, in other words,\n\n470\n00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.700\nright The bad actor to go play\nin somebody else's sandbox.\n\n471\n00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.650\nAnd I have sympathy for those people\nthat are not as well prepared as me, but\n\n472\n00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.700\nmy job as a CCSP, and my job as\na consultant to my client, and my job\n\n473\n00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.450\nas a practitioner In an organization is to\nensure that no harm comes to my resources.\n\n474\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.760\nAnd no harm comes to things\nI'm responsible for.\n\n475\n00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.270\nIt's somebody else's problem if I send you\ndown the road and you get hurt down there.\n\n476\n00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:00.220\nIt's not mine.\n\n477\n00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.710\nAnd I'm not trying to\nbe callous about this.\n\n478\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.590\nI wanna be clear.\n\n479\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.020\nJust trying to be brutally honest and\nrealistic with you.\n\n480\n00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:09.960\nAs a security professional, I'm paid\nto safeguard infrastructure that my.\n\n481\n00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.480\nCompany or my enterprise or\nthe person that hires me\n\n482\n00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:17.120\nhas said is important to them and\nthat's my job that's my sole focus.\n\n483\n00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.620\nI'm not paid to be a nice guy and\n\n484\n00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.670\nhelp everybody else down the road\nthat doesn't get it to figure out.\n\n485\n00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:24.430\nI'm paid to make sure the bad things\nhappen to those people if they're not\n\n486\n00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.790\nprepared, but\nthat they don't happen to me and\n\n487\n00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.930\nmy people and that's my job\nthat's my first and foremost job.\n\n488\n00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.300\nIt is my only job.\n\n489\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.990\nI have to be This much better and this\nis what I tell customers all the time.\n\n490\n00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.150\nAnd I don't know if you can really see\nthat, and you really probably can't, and\n\n491\n00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.110\neven if you zoom in.\n\n492\n00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.920\nWhat I'm trying to do is\nessentially show you,\n\n493\n00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.570\nI have to be just a smidge better than\nthe bad actors in order to be successful.\n\n494\n00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.360\nBut here's the challenge,\n\n495\n00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.670\ncuz if it was that easy everybody\nwould do what we do, right?\n\n496\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.640\nAnd it's hard to do\nwhat we do with CCSP's,\n\n497\n00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.570\nthe CISSP's, as security professionals\nof any kind, of any caliber,\n\n498\n00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.800\nunder any Certified vendors flag,\ndoesn't matter.\n\n499\n00:23:58.800 --> 00:23:59.570\nSecurity is security.\n\n500\n00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:01.069\nIt doesn't matter whose certifying you.\n\n501\n00:24:01.069 --> 00:24:04.695\nIf you're good at what you do,\nyou understand the basic concepts of\n\n502\n00:24:04.695 --> 00:24:09.341\nrisk management, you understand the basic\nconcepts Of how to prioritize the business\n\n503\n00:24:09.341 --> 00:24:12.610\nrequirements and\nmatch them against the risk you face.\n\n504\n00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.510\nAnd figure out how to be as sharp\nas you can be in those areas that\n\n505\n00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:19.020\nare critical to the business, and\navoid the things that will bring harm, and\n\n506\n00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.220\nengage in the activities you have to,\nbut in a risk averse way.\n\n507\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.340\nBut we have to be just a smidge better\nthan the bad actors looking to do us harm.\n\n508\n00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.410\nThat's not the hard part,\n\n509\n00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.910\nthe hard part is we have to be that\nbetter, that smidge better, all the time.\n\n510\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.640\nThe bad actor only has to be\nbetter than us one time to get in,\n\n511\n00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.990\nwe have to be better than them\nall the time to keep them out.\n\n512\n00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.610\nAnd this is one of those unspoken\nrealities of what we do for\n\n513\n00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.520\na living when you think about security.\n\n514\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.250\nI didn't get this gray and\n\n515\n00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:47.830\nlose most of what's going on up here,\nright, because it's easy to do what we do.\n\n516\n00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.390\nI spend a lot of time worrying about a lot\nof things that most people never consider,\n\n517\n00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:56.360\non behalf of customers, because\nsomebody's gotta figure this stuff out.\n\n518\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.700\nIt may not be them, it may be somebody\nwho's knowledgeable, it may be you,\n\n519\n00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.410\nwhen you become a CCSB.\n\n520\n00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.983\nAnd I know that you will be\nsuccessful to do that, at some point,\n\n521\n00:25:02.983 --> 00:25:06.274\nwhen you get through going through all\nthe material that we're sharing with you,\n\n522\n00:25:06.274 --> 00:25:07.818\nwe're creating in all the episodes.\n\n523\n00:25:07.818 --> 00:25:10.640\nAs well as sitting for,\nstudying and taking the exam.\n\n524\n00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.690\nOnce you are certified, you will have\nto do these things on a regular basis.\n\n525\n00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:18.410\nYou'll have to identify risks,\nyou'll have to be, as Daniel said, right,\n\n526\n00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.830\nyou will have to be paranoid.\n\n527\n00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.690\nAnd be as paranoid as you need to be,\nbut understand that no matter how\n\n528\n00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.480\nparanoid you are, there's always somebody\nout there who's better than you.\n\n529\n00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.300\nAnd this is one of the things that as\na security professional you really need to\n\n530\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.160\ntake to heart,\n\n531\n00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:34.910\nbecause the first time it happens to you,\nit is devastating if you don't get it.\n\n532\n00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:38.170\nThere's always bad actors,\nthere's always people, good or bad or\n\n533\n00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.040\nindifferent, that know more than\nyou do in anything you do in life.\n\n534\n00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.520\nDoesn't matter what it is,\nI've been doing this a very long time, and\n\n535\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:49.460\nI know this much about a subject\nthat is massively large.\n\n536\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.300\nAnd I know more than a lot a people, but\n\n537\n00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.790\nI also don't know as much\nas many people that I know.\n\n538\n00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.560\nI have mentors, I have colleagues that\nare much more knowledgeable than me.\n\n539\n00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.750\nJust like I may be more\nknowledgeable than some people,\n\n540\n00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.880\nthere are many people that\nknow a lot more than I do.\n\n541\n00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.580\nAnd you get the chance to\nsee a lot of them on ITProTV\n\n542\n00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.840\njust like you get the chance to see me,\non occasion.\n\n543\n00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.460\nWe all are experts at things we know and\nknow well, but there's many things we\n\n544\n00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.963\ndon't know well, and you have to be humble\nto be a good security professional.\n\n545\n00:26:12.963 --> 00:26:14.636\nCuz you have to be willing to ask for\nhelp, and\n\n546\n00:26:14.636 --> 00:26:17.760\nyou have to understand that there are\nthings, that no matter how paranoid you\n\n547\n00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.230\nare about, you're not gonna understand\nhow to really be successful with.\n\n548\n00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.690\nAnd somebody who knows more than you,\nis gonna come take that away from you,\n\n549\n00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.640\nunless you're willing to ask others for\nhelp, and willing to get\n\n550\n00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.120\nthem to share their experience with you\nand figure out the best path forward.\n\n551\n00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.860\nI spend a lot of time offering that\nhelp to customers and to students, but\n\n552\n00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.050\nI also spend a lot of time getting that\nhelp from my peers and colleagues,\n\n553\n00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:41.380\nmy support network, to ensure that\nI make the right decisions and\n\n554\n00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.980\nthat I offer the right guidance.\n\n555\n00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.060\nAnd I learned a long time ago,\nnot just in this business but in life,\n\n556\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.600\nthat I'm never gonna be good enough at\neverything to be able to do it all myself.\n\n557\n00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.910\nAnd it's one of the most valuable\nlessons to try to teach my customers.\n\n558\n00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.620\nI try to impart to my students that\nno matter how good I think I am,\n\n559\n00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.650\nI'm never gonna have all\nthe answers you want.\n\n560\n00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.260\nAnd I have to be willing to tell you that,\nand I have to be willing\n\n561\n00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.758\nto help you figure it out, but\nI may not be the primary resource.\n\n562\n00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:08.620\nAnd that's gonna be very important for\nyou to consider, and very important for\n\n563\n00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.600\nyou to internalize in everything you do.\n\n564\n00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.710\nNot just here, but\nin anything you do right across the board.\n\n565\n00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.240\nI'd like to think I'm really good at\nstuff, but I'm reminded all the time\n\n566\n00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.360\nthat I could always be better, and that's\nsomething you really have to think about.\n\n567\n00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:23.330\nJust as being a human,\nnot just as being a security professional,\n\n568\n00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:25.190\nbut being paranoid is good, right?\n\n569\n00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.190\nBut being paranoid and then being willing\nto ask for help is even more important and\n\n570\n00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.030\nbetter than ultimately\njust being paranoid.\n\n571\n00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.810\nCuz when you're paranoid, you don't\nreally get the fact that you need help.\n\n572\n00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.860\nYou just look around every corner and\nsee all the spooky, bad shadow things.\n\n573\n00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:41.990\nAnd you think, my God, my God, my God,\nI gotta start protecting everything, and\n\n574\n00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.470\nthen you wind up protecting nothing.\n\n575\n00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.671\nRight, because reality is you spend all\nyour time chasing what we call purple\n\n576\n00:27:46.671 --> 00:27:48.240\nunicorns or purple squirrels.\n\n577\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.120\nAnd as a result,\nthere's really no value of that.\n\n578\n00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.800\nYou gotta focus your energy and\nyour efforts on things that are important.\n\n579\n00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.180\nSo risk assessment to your point,\nvery, very critical for us to do.\n\n580\n00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:58.361\nWhat are some sample use cases for\nencryption?\n\n581\n00:27:58.361 --> 00:28:00.969\nSo where are some places we may\nuse encryption, what do you think\n\n582\n00:28:00.969 --> 00:28:04.226\nare potentially some reasons why or\nplaces where we may see encryption?\n\n583\n00:28:04.226 --> 00:28:08.565\n>> We definitely use encryption on\nsensitive data that is static on a drive\n\n584\n00:28:08.565 --> 00:28:09.372\nsomewhere.\n\n585\n00:28:09.372 --> 00:28:12.774\nWe want to encrypted that in case it falls\nin the wrong hands, they can't use it.\n\n586\n00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:15.723\nWe definitely use encryption\nwhen it comes to web.\n\n587\n00:28:15.723 --> 00:28:18.251\nRight, we're accessing\nthings like our banking,\n\n588\n00:28:18.251 --> 00:28:21.934\nany sensitive information that is\npersonal, we want that to be encrypted.\n\n589\n00:28:21.934 --> 00:28:24.764\nWe use it for access to remote systems.\n\n590\n00:28:24.764 --> 00:28:28.752\nUsing things like SSH where it involves\nan encryption scheme to make sure that,\n\n591\n00:28:28.752 --> 00:28:31.250\nthat data is not intercepted,\nand then seen, and\n\n592\n00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:33.943\ngleaned maybe some\ninformation that's sensitive.\n\n593\n00:28:33.943 --> 00:28:36.905\nEverywhere, encryption can be used.\n\n594\n00:28:36.905 --> 00:28:40.112\n>> Okay, so everywhere it can be, but\ndo we actually use it all the time and\n\n595\n00:28:40.112 --> 00:28:42.990\nthe reality is we may or\nwe may not, it depends, right?\n\n596\n00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:45.360\nA lot of times and all the things you\ndescribed are absolutely correct.\n\n597\n00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.530\nBut here's the challenge, right, here's\nwhere being paranoid but knowing where to\n\n598\n00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:51.990\nask for help really becomes that balancing\nact and finding the level set, right?\n\n599\n00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.910\nWe know encryption's good,\nwe know that we should use it, but yet\n\n600\n00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:55.862\nwe don't all the time.\n\n601\n00:28:55.862 --> 00:28:59.540\nAnd to Daniel's points, we should,\nbut we don't always see it used.\n\n602\n00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.540\nA lot of people, as crazy as it sounds,\n\n603\n00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:05.270\ndon't use an SSH compatible\ntelnet like client or\n\n604\n00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:10.060\nterminal client, they use an insecure\nmechanism to remotely administer machines.\n\n605\n00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:14.712\nTo Daniel's point, we may engage in online\nbanking or things like that and we may be\n\n606\n00:29:14.712 --> 00:29:18.910\nusing a secure protocol, and we may be\nusing SSL with TLS to transact that.\n\n607\n00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:22.204\nBut, yet at the same time, we don't\nknow what's going on on the back end and\n\n608\n00:29:22.204 --> 00:29:25.213\nwhether that data is secured,\nbecause it's encrypted in storage.\n\n609\n00:29:25.213 --> 00:29:29.542\nAnd most importantly, we don't know\nwhether or not that data is being made\n\n610\n00:29:29.542 --> 00:29:34.161\navailable through some sort of web-based\nAPI in a way that is being protected.\n\n611\n00:29:34.161 --> 00:29:37.238\nAnd we talked about the OWASP web\napplication vulnerabilities, right,\n\n612\n00:29:37.238 --> 00:29:40.313\nin one of our prior sessions, and\nin one of the prior episodes where we went\n\n613\n00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:43.560\nthrough the entire top ten list of\nweb application vulnerabilities.\n\n614\n00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.920\nWe talked about injection attacks.\n\n615\n00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:47.420\nVery first attack at the top of that list,\nand\n\n616\n00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:51.840\nwe talked about the fact that buffer\noverflows and data validation, and\n\n617\n00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.270\nall of the things that we have to do and\nprotect against would be important.\n\n618\n00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:56.670\nWe may be encrypting data,\n\n619\n00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.990\nthat's no guarantee that the data will be\nprotected in all phases and all forms.\n\n620\n00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.310\nSo the reality is while we\nwanna see encryption used,\n\n621\n00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.360\nwe may not always use encryption cuz\nwe may not understand it, number one.\n\n622\n00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.080\nWe may not always use it because\nthere's a myth around this, and\n\n623\n00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.740\nan urban legend around this, that\nencryption equals bad performance, right?\n\n624\n00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.420\nWe encrypt data, it slows things down,\nit's gonna make it harder for us to access\n\n625\n00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.760\nthe data, it's gonna make it harder for\nus to do the things we have to do, so\n\n626\n00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.840\nit essentially makes it more complicated,\nnot less complicated to do this.\n\n627\n00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.940\nAnd while that may be true in some cases,\nright, I wanna be honest, I wanna be fair.\n\n628\n00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.290\nEncryption definitely slows down access\ncuz you have to unencrypt and re-encrypt.\n\n629\n00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.650\nThere's no doubt about it, there's no way\nto say that doesn't happen cuz it does.\n\n630\n00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.870\nBut we can off-set that, we can use of\nhardware accelerators, we can use caching.\n\n631\n00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:42.440\nWe do a variety of things to be able to\noff-set that performance liability, and\n\n632\n00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.380\nit's really no longer as dire\nas it used to be years ago,\n\n633\n00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.840\nwhere technology was relatively\nunderdeveloped in these areas.\n\n634\n00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:52.441\nWe didn't really have a good understanding\nof how to do that properly, so\n\n635\n00:30:52.441 --> 00:30:54.488\nwe can essentially off-set that today.\n\n636\n00:30:54.488 --> 00:30:58.790\nWhat we really have to do, let's focus on\nthe concerns with regards to educating our\n\n637\n00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.275\nusers about why encryption is so\nimportant, and\n\n638\n00:31:01.275 --> 00:31:03.103\nwhy they have to make good choices.\n\n639\n00:31:03.103 --> 00:31:06.997\nBecause it's not just about encryption,\nit's about the usage of the system, and\n\n640\n00:31:06.997 --> 00:31:08.740\nall areas of the life cycle, right?\n\n641\n00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.530\nWe can encrypt data, but if somebody\nwalks away from a secure system, leaves\n\n642\n00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.940\nthe interface open and leaves the data\nexposed on the screen, it's not encrypted.\n\n643\n00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.830\nIt's encrypted when it's stored,\nit's encrypted when we send it, but\n\n644\n00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:21.250\nthe reality is they've\nlogged into the app.\n\n645\n00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:24.730\nSo even though it may be encrypted,\nit's being exposed in unencrypted format.\n\n646\n00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:28.150\nAnd if they walk away, something as\nsimple as not locking out the screen\n\n647\n00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:29.690\nmeans that the data may be comprised,\n\n648\n00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:33.100\neven though encryption's been\nessentially in effect all across, right?\n\n649\n00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.454\nSo we have to think about that,\nwe have to understand that and\n\n650\n00:31:35.454 --> 00:31:37.309\nreally think through\nthe logic of encryption.\n\n651\n00:31:37.309 --> 00:31:40.501\nSo I know that I had asked Daniel to\nload up a special video that we want\n\n652\n00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:43.368\nto show you really quickly,\nat least a little snippet of it.\n\n653\n00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:44.906\nDo we go to the two minute mark,\napproximately,\n\n654\n00:31:44.906 --> 00:31:45.966\nwhere we had talked about going.\n\n655\n00:31:45.966 --> 00:31:48.793\nSo, in just a second, we're gonna put\nthis up, let me just set this up for you.\n\n656\n00:31:48.793 --> 00:31:52.252\nWhat I'm gonna show you, or what Daniel\nis gonna be kind enough to show you, and\n\n657\n00:31:52.252 --> 00:31:53.365\nwe're gonna give you a link to so\n\n658\n00:31:53.365 --> 00:31:55.785\nyou can watch the whole video,\ncuz it's about eight minutes long.\n\n659\n00:31:55.785 --> 00:31:57.505\nWe're not gonna show you the whole video,\nbut\n\n660\n00:31:57.505 --> 00:31:59.320\nwe are going to show you\na little snippet of it.\n\n661\n00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.244\nIs a behind the scenes tour of\none of the Google's data centers,\n\n662\n00:32:02.244 --> 00:32:04.969\none of the new ones in Oregon\nthey recently brought on line.\n\n663\n00:32:04.969 --> 00:32:08.410\nTheir data center management team did\na little behind the scenes video, and\n\n664\n00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.528\nshot an eight minute walk through\nlooking at all the technology, and\n\n665\n00:32:11.528 --> 00:32:13.356\nthe behind the scenes stuff you never see.\n\n666\n00:32:13.356 --> 00:32:15.316\nIt's really, really cool, number one.\n\n667\n00:32:15.316 --> 00:32:17.949\nIt's a cloud-based data center,\nso it's all about the cloud and\n\n668\n00:32:17.949 --> 00:32:19.320\ntechnology to support the cloud.\n\n669\n00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.010\nIt's incredibly relevant about\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n670\n00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:25.390\nI use it in my cloud courses to show my\nstudents all the time what this stuff\n\n671\n00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:26.940\nlooks like, if you've never seen it.\n\n672\n00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:31.750\nWe're gonna focus specifically at around\nthe two-minute mark in the video for\n\n673\n00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.370\nabout maybe 15, 30 seconds or so and\n\n674\n00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:38.910\nshow you what the racked infrastructure in\na secure data center actually looks like.\n\n675\n00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.530\nMiles and miles of it, as you will see,\ncuz it's incredibly massive, so\n\n676\n00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.470\nif we could go to Daniel's screen,\nI think we're gonna wanna go full screen.\n\n677\n00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.860\nGet me out of the picture cuz we're\ngonna be able to really see that nicely.\n\n678\n00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:48.870\nCan you do full screen on the video?\n\n679\n00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:49.840\n>> Yeah, I can probably do full screen.\n\n680\n00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:52.090\n>> Okay, so\ndo full screen on the video as well, and\n\n681\n00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.750\nwe left the subtitles up,\njust before we start playing it.\n\n682\n00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.470\nWe left the subtitles up because there is\nreally nothing other than talking going\n\n683\n00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.300\non, so you're not really gonna hear\nanything, and you could see them,\n\n684\n00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.530\nthis is just the guy walking through the\ndata centers, so you could take a look and\n\n685\n00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:05.459\nsee what's going on there.\n\n686\n00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.460\nThis is the data center, this is in\na single building as he's saying, and\n\n687\n00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:14.240\nthis is just row after row of racked\ninfrastructure that they are using.\n\n688\n00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:17.350\nYou can see one of the Google security\nguys standing behind him there,\n\n689\n00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.880\nthe network admin that he is with\nthat's keeping an eye on him.\n\n690\n00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.830\nEven though he works for Google, they're\nnot allowed to roam the data center\n\n691\n00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.320\non their own without an escort because\nthey can't be in there messing around\n\n692\n00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:29.440\nif anything were to go wrong, and so\nyou can see how all this is built.\n\n693\n00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:32.885\nThis is all custom infrastructure for\nthem, and essentially they architect\n\n694\n00:33:32.885 --> 00:33:36.489\ntheir own systems, they build their own\ninfrastructure, and you can see the big\n\n695\n00:33:36.489 --> 00:33:39.675\nkind of bulky security guy walking\naround with him everywhere he goes.\n\n696\n00:33:39.675 --> 00:33:44.667\nThis is the racked storage infrastructure\nand the network access infrastructure,\n\n697\n00:33:44.667 --> 00:33:47.696\nand you can see the cable\nmanagement we talk about.\n\n698\n00:33:47.696 --> 00:33:49.984\nThis is one of the network\nengineers that's coming in,\n\n699\n00:33:49.984 --> 00:33:53.210\njust to give them a little background and\ninsight into what they're going on.\n\n700\n00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.610\nThis is a hardware operation, just gonna\ngo out, and bulk upload some storage or\n\n701\n00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.870\nmake available some new storage, and so\nyou can see the kind of infrastructure\n\n702\n00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.020\nthey have and\nthe way in which it's all set up.\n\n703\n00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:05.546\nThis is pretty cool stuff, right?\n\n704\n00:34:05.546 --> 00:34:08.655\nOperating a data center like this is\npretty impressive, and at the same time\n\n705\n00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:11.779\nyou don't see the beginning of the video\nbecause I haven't shown it to you.\n\n706\n00:34:11.779 --> 00:34:15.946\nBut the security features they go through\nin the beginning, they've got a biometrics\n\n707\n00:34:15.946 --> 00:34:19.942\nsecurity system, so he's gotta go into\nbasically a bubble transport system, and\n\n708\n00:34:19.942 --> 00:34:23.043\nhe's gotta go in, step into an iris scan,\nand it's a man trap.\n\n709\n00:34:23.043 --> 00:34:26.067\nBut it opens up to allow him in, to the\nsecure part of the data hosting site of\n\n710\n00:34:26.067 --> 00:34:28.851\nthe data center, and they've got\narmed guards out at the gates, and\n\n711\n00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:31.010\nthey got all sorts of\nlayers of protection.\n\n712\n00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.130\nSo, just interesting.\n\n713\n00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:34.420\nI thought I would,\nbring a little bit of this to you.\n\n714\n00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.045\nThey did mention there, just a moment ago,\nthat they're hosting 75 VMs.\n\n715\n00:34:38.045 --> 00:34:40.910\n75,000 VMs,\nin one of these data center buildings,\n\n716\n00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:43.070\nthat are running simultaneously.\n\n717\n00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.430\n>> That's a lot.\n>> So, that's a lot, right,\n\n718\n00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:45.150\nwhen you think about it.\n\n719\n00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.580\nSo okay, so I think we could\nprobably Break away from that now.\n\n720\n00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.600\nIt's pretty cool.\n\n721\n00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.990\nWe'll post the URL so you can watch the\nwhole video if you'd like hopefully, and\n\n722\n00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.900\nmake that available for\nyou to take a look at.\n\n723\n00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.920\nPretty cool infrastructure.\n\n724\n00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.130\nSo when we think about stuff like that and\nhow encryption gets applied there,\n\n725\n00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:04.690\nobviously we have to look at all the\ndifferent areas we can apply security at,\n\n726\n00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.120\nphysical and logical encryption.\n\n727\n00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.350\nWe have to think about the different\nlevels that encryption operates at\n\n728\n00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:11.620\nthe data itself The encryption engine.\n\n729\n00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:12.660\nWhat is driving encryption?\n\n730\n00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.280\nHow is it applied?\n\n731\n00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.190\nAnd also the encryption keys.\n\n732\n00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:16.500\nWe really have to think about\n\n733\n00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.690\nthe different ways in\nwhich we apply encryption.\n\n734\n00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.280\nHow encryption is structured and\n\n735\n00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:23.760\nwhat it looks like ultimately with\nregards to our encryption architecture.\n\n736\n00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.030\nAnd we actually have to set up\na whole separate architecture\n\n737\n00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.850\nunique to the application of\nencryption across the enterprise.\n\n738\n00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.030\nWith regards to the cloud,\nat least we should anyway.\n\n739\n00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.940\nWe have to think about what that looks\nlike and we have to focus on that, a cloud\n\n740\n00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:40.410\ndata architect is involved in specifying\nhow encryption would be applied.\n\n741\n00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.630\nThis is one of the role and one of\nthe mechanisms that we use in that role to\n\n742\n00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:47.990\nsafeguard data and as a CCSP, it may not\nbe our direct responsibility to figure\n\n743\n00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.260\nthis out, but it may be our responsibility\nto understand that it's happening or\n\n744\n00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.070\nif it's not happening then it should And\n\n745\n00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.720\nthen it's gonna be our responsibility\nto make sure that we monitor and\n\n746\n00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:59.010\nultimately enforce the mechanisms\nthat will allow this to occur.\n\n747\n00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.690\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n748\n00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.190\nThere's a lot of information going on,\nand we just got more.\n\n749\n00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.930\nAnd more is gonna come, so\njust sit back and enjoy.\n\n750\n00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:07.980\nBut as for this episode,\nwe've definitely covered a lot of topics.\n\n751\n00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:12.530\nLooking at what threats are out there,\nwhat do we have to prepare ourselves for\n\n752\n00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.750\nAnd then what can we do to actually\nstart preparing for that and\n\n753\n00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.180\ntry to mitigate those threats?\n\n754\n00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.070\nEncryption obviously being one of\nthe heavy hitters in the ballgame,\n\n755\n00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:21.060\nthat's for sure.\n\n756\n00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.850\nAdam, we appreciate you stopping by today.\n\n757\n00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.540\nLooks like we're gonna go ahead and\nclose our show down, though.\n\n758\n00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.562\nOur clock is gone.\n\n759\n00:36:26.562 --> 00:36:28.210\n[LAUGH] Thank you guys for watching.\n\n760\n00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.430\n>> The cloud is evaporating.\n\n761\n00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.540\n>> That's right,\nthe cloud is starting to wisp away.\n\n762\n00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.660\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n763\n00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:35.690\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n764\n00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:42.890\nI have not been your host Andrew Lowry but\nI have been your host Adam Gordon.\n\n765\n00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:47.023\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n766\n00:36:47.023 --> 00:36:48.847\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.473\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode, we are continuing forward\n\n4\n00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:23.240\nwith our certified cloud\nsecurity professional series.\n\n5\n00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.274\nJoining us back in the studio to\nhelp us out with that very endeavor,\n\n6\n00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:28.950\nfor another part two,\nis our good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.810\nAdam, welcome back to the show,\nand how's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.606\n>> I just wanna make it clear\nto everybody I have no friends.\n\n9\n00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:33.900\n>> [LAUGH] I have no friends.\n\n10\n00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.150\n>> I don't know who this person is\nwho's standing next to me and speaking,\n\n11\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.980\nI've never seen him before.\n\n12\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.040\n>> You are your own best friend.\n\n13\n00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.021\n>> I am my own friend.\n\n14\n00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:41.081\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so I'm doing good, and\n\n15\n00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.588\nhopefully all of you\nare doing good as well.\n\n16\n00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:45.990\nAnd we wanna continue doing well, and\n\n17\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.070\nwe wanna continue talking about things\nthat help us as CCSPs to do that.\n\n18\n00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.744\nAnd so we're gonna talk\nsome more about encryption,\n\n19\n00:00:51.744 --> 00:00:56.170\nwe're gonna talk some more about storage,\ngonna talk about storage based encryption\n\n20\n00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.860\nbecause it is such a fun and\nexciting topic to talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.920\nYou can see the excitement on\nDaniel's face when you look at him.\n\n22\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.102\nAnd see what kind of encryption\nexcitement, there you go.\n\n23\n00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:06.258\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That was truly scary, by the way,\n\n24\n00:01:06.258 --> 00:01:08.510\nI just thought I'd put that out there.\n\n25\n00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.020\nThose of you with small children, make\nsure they're not watching going forward.\n\n26\n00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.120\n>> Little PSA or\na warning at the beginning of the episode.\n\n27\n00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.310\n>> Block that out so\nnobody could see that.\n\n28\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.481\nAll right, so anyway, all kidding aside,\nwe're here to talk about in part two,\n\n29\n00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:24.351\nas Daniel just said, we're here to\ncontinue talking about the ways in which\n\n30\n00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.857\nwe can apply security to the data area,\nor the data layer if you will,\n\n31\n00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:29.568\nof the cloud data architecture.\n\n32\n00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:33.130\nAnd the focus on data security within\nthe cloud is very, very important.\n\n33\n00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.720\nWe've been talking in our last episode,\nand again, I would just give you a sense\n\n34\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.180\nof reminding you that that prior episode\nthat you hopefully have just finished\n\n35\n00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.310\nwatching, will really set you up for\nthe conversations we're gonna have here.\n\n36\n00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.361\nIf you have not watched that episode yet,\nit'd be a good idea to jump back a little\n\n37\n00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:51.295\nbit, go through that prior to going\nthrough this episode with us if possible,\n\n38\n00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:52.670\nif that works for you.\n\n39\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.215\nOnly cuz it will make it\na little bit easier for\n\n40\n00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:57.050\nyou to pick up the threads of the\nconversation we're gonna continue having.\n\n41\n00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.590\nWe were talking about storage and\n\n42\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.020\nencryption and how encryption\nbecomes very critical to what we do.\n\n43\n00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.050\nWe had talked also about the different\nways in which we access data.\n\n44\n00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.970\nThat was actually two\nepisodes prior to this one.\n\n45\n00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.830\nBut we talked about volume or\nblock-based storage.\n\n46\n00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.450\nWe talked about object\nstorage in the IIS layer.\n\n47\n00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.610\nAnd talking about that again,\n\n48\n00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.910\nI wanna go back to that idea quickly of\nhow we now apply encryption to the IIS\n\n49\n00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.790\nsolution with regards to storage, to\nkind of bring that conversation forward.\n\n50\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.483\nAnd reference it, so\nwhen we think about IIS, and\n\n51\n00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:30.078\nwe think about the idea that\ninfrastructure is being provided to us\n\n52\n00:02:30.078 --> 00:02:34.592\nfrom the cloud service provider, we order\nup whatever we would like from the menu.\n\n53\n00:02:34.592 --> 00:02:38.392\nAnd we essentially say to the provider,\nI need these kinds of resources, make them\n\n54\n00:02:38.392 --> 00:02:42.830\navailable to me, I will then go ahead\nas the costumer and provision them out.\n\n55\n00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.510\nWe're gonna deal with encryption and the\nmanagement of storage at different levels.\n\n56\n00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.840\nWe have what we call basic\nstorage level encryption.\n\n57\n00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.920\nThis is the idea of applying\nstorage management or\n\n58\n00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.470\nstorage level encryption at the management\nlevel or at the management layer.\n\n59\n00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.020\nSo the storage management interface\nis where we would apply encryption.\n\n60\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.180\nThis may or may not be exposed\ndirectly to us as the customer.\n\n61\n00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.940\nWe typically have the ability to see it.\n\n62\n00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.210\nBut the cloud service provider may\nactually be dealing with this and\n\n63\n00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.830\nmay be managing aspects of it for us.\n\n64\n00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.100\nOr on our behalf,\nmaybe providing us access to parts of it,\n\n65\n00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.400\nbut perhaps not all of it.\n\n66\n00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.170\nWe may, for instance,\n\n67\n00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.000\nbe able to apply encryption and\ncontrol the application of it.\n\n68\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.700\nBut we may not be able to provide\nthe actual, or carve up and\n\n69\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.340\nprovide the administration\nof the storage itself.\n\n70\n00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.150\nThe raw storage may be provisioned and\n\n71\n00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.280\nthen presented to us in\na management interface.\n\n72\n00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.680\nWe may not have the right to do that\nbecause remember, the storage is being\n\n73\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.100\ncontrolled by the CSP, the cloud service\nprovider, on behalf of multiple tenants,\n\n74\n00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.340\ntraditionally in some sort of a storage\narray, typically a storage array network.\n\n75\n00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.250\nBecause of that, we may not have\nrights to the entire SAN, but\n\n76\n00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.160\nrather only a very small portion of it.\n\n77\n00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.710\nSo we may have a constrained interface, so\n\n78\n00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.700\nwe just wanna be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n79\n00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.758\nBut the idea of storage level encryption\nis really the idea that basic\n\n80\n00:03:52.758 --> 00:03:55.605\nstorage level of encryption of\napplying it through a management\n\n81\n00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:58.098\ninterface at essentially\nthe hardware level, right.\n\n82\n00:03:58.098 --> 00:04:01.596\nWe're really protecting against\nhardware loss and theft and or\n\n83\n00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:04.000\nmisuse of the hardware\nby doing it this way.\n\n84\n00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.698\nThis is not going to\napproach the upper levels or\n\n85\n00:04:06.698 --> 00:04:09.335\nupper layers of\nthe application interfaces.\n\n86\n00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:13.475\nWe're really focusing on\napplying it at the basic level.\n\n87\n00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:17.085\nThe encryption keys are typically going\nto be held by the cloud provider and,\n\n88\n00:04:17.085 --> 00:04:19.195\nagain, controlled by them most likely.\n\n89\n00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:23.412\nSo they're gonna encrypt the entire\nstorage area network at the hardware level\n\n90\n00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:26.022\nusing the hardware provider's\nencryption mechanisms.\n\n91\n00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:28.262\nAnd then provide or\nmaintain those keys so that way,\n\n92\n00:04:28.262 --> 00:04:30.462\nthey can allow access to the data.\n\n93\n00:04:30.462 --> 00:04:35.200\nBut they're gonna most likely control it,\nthe encryption engine writes and reads to\n\n94\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.880\nthe data storage array, decrypts storage\nupon use and then re-encrypts on demand.\n\n95\n00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.781\nBut typically the cloud\nstorage provider or\n\n96\n00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:46.590\nthe cloud service provider\nis going to control that.\n\n97\n00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.062\nAnd they actually abstract that and\n\n98\n00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:51.680\nnot even let us see that layer just to\nassure us that it's actually happening.\n\n99\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.112\nSo, this is relevant to both object and\nvolume, or what we'd call block storage.\n\n100\n00:04:55.112 --> 00:04:57.730\nWe wanna think about that\nbecause it's important for\n\n101\n00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.160\nthat level of encryption to\nbe applied by the provider.\n\n102\n00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.460\nSo that way, we're assured that at every\nlevel of the system, at every layer and\n\n103\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.750\nevery potential entry point for\ndata access and for data management,\n\n104\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.210\nthat we're applying encryption in order\nto ensure that the maximum level of\n\n105\n00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.508\nprotection can be achieved as we\nhave been talking about before.\n\n106\n00:05:16.508 --> 00:05:21.080\nWe then wanna think about moving on to\nwhat we call volume or block storage.\n\n107\n00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.610\nThe idea there is that when\nwe use volume storage or\n\n108\n00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.260\nvolume based encryption, we're gonna see\ntwo different mechanisms, traditionally,\n\n109\n00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.030\ntwo different ways of implementing this.\n\n110\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.178\nWe're gonna talk about what's\neither instance-based encryption or\n\n111\n00:05:32.178 --> 00:05:33.750\nproxy-based encryption.\n\n112\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.830\nWhen we think about\ninstance-based encryption,\n\n113\n00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.390\nif you say that correctly, we're often\nthinking about the encryption engine\n\n114\n00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.080\nbeing located on the instance itself.\n\n115\n00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.163\nEssentially, within remember the operating\nsystem that is being mounted,\n\n116\n00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:49.487\nthe guest OS, as we talked about,\nthat will mount the volume or\n\n117\n00:05:49.487 --> 00:05:53.374\nthe data block that we can see is\nprobably a hard drive, a lung, a volume,\n\n118\n00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:56.566\nwhatever you would call it,\nwhatever we may refer to it as.\n\n119\n00:05:56.566 --> 00:06:00.131\nDaniel helped us to work through that and\nhelped us to understand that in his\n\n120\n00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:03.990\nexplanation or his helping us to work\nthrough by explaining that concept for us.\n\n121\n00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.300\nIf you remember what a great\njob you did with that,\n\n122\n00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.030\nwhen I asked you what the concept was,\nyou said well, it's kind of like a volume,\n\n123\n00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.480\nwe had that whole conversation.\n\n124\n00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.540\nAt least, I think you did that.\n\n125\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.210\nIf it was not you, it was somebody\nwho looks suspiciously like you.\n\n126\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.220\n>> It's my doppelgänger.\n\n127\n00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.162\n>> Wasn't smiling like the joker when we\nsaid how excited are you about encryption.\n\n128\n00:06:20.162 --> 00:06:23.010\nBut Daniel helped us to understand\nthat in the last episode.\n\n129\n00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.816\nAnd he explained when we\nwere talking about it,\n\n130\n00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:27.060\nthat it's really essentially\nlike a hard drive, right.\n\n131\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.540\nAnd we see it much like,\nI think you said, much like Windows.\n\n132\n00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.490\nYou used that kind of analogy, and we\ntalked about the fact that, essentially,\n\n133\n00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.130\nit's like seeing the C drive in Windows or\nthe D drive or whatever it may be.\n\n134\n00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.060\nSo, when we're thinking about that,\nthe instance-based encryption engine\n\n135\n00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.970\nruns inside the operating system,\nessentially is part of the OS.\n\n136\n00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.139\nWe could think of this as something\nlike BitLocker, for instance,\n\n137\n00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:46.833\nin Windows, right.\n\n138\n00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:50.234\nIf you wanna think about that technology\nor if you think about some sort of\n\n139\n00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:53.305\nencryption-based technology\nrunning in an operating system,\n\n140\n00:06:53.305 --> 00:06:57.220\nwhatever that may be, that's essentially\nwhat we may be talking about here.\n\n141\n00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.720\nKeys can be guarded locally, but\n\n142\n00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.360\nshould typically be managed\nexternally to the instance.\n\n143\n00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.610\nSo we may use a centralized key management\nsolution to pull those encryption keys out\n\n144\n00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.070\nof individual VMs and\nessentially manage and maintain them.\n\n145\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.260\nProbably a key escrow solution would be\nvaluable here as well to have a separate\n\n146\n00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.260\ncopy of those keys kept safely and\nsecurely, most likely off premise and\n\n147\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.420\nsomewhere separate from the actual\nhosting that's being done.\n\n148\n00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.546\nThat way, if there's a problem, some\nsort of BCDR event of some kind, this is\n\n149\n00:07:23.546 --> 00:07:27.988\ncontinuity, disaster recovery related\nconcerns, we can go to that escrow agent,\n\n150\n00:07:27.988 --> 00:07:31.384\nfollow our escrow recovery procedures,\nwhatever they may be.\n\n151\n00:07:31.384 --> 00:07:33.256\nAnd then hopefully retrieve the keys and\n\n152\n00:07:33.256 --> 00:07:36.617\nthen use them to ultimately unlock\nthe data, perhaps unencrypted, and\n\n153\n00:07:36.617 --> 00:07:39.810\nthen use it to restore the data,\nwhatever that may look like.\n\n154\n00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.731\nSo instance-based encryption,\nalso proxy-based encryption,\n\n155\n00:07:42.731 --> 00:07:45.867\nwanna make sure we have a sense that\nwe can offload essentially, right?\n\n156\n00:07:45.867 --> 00:07:50.229\nThrough proxying, asking somebody to\noperate on our behalf, or some thing,\n\n157\n00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:54.589\nin this case, usually an encryption\nappliance that we can offload to that will\n\n158\n00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:58.554\nbulk encrypt, or view and manage\nencryption for multiple instances or\n\n159\n00:07:58.554 --> 00:08:02.610\nmultiple volumes and things of that\nnature, so we can think about that.\n\n160\n00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.256\nWe run on the proxy instance or through\nthe appliance to do the encryption.\n\n161\n00:08:06.256 --> 00:08:10.079\nThe proxy will map the data or the volumes\nfor us so we can interact with it but\n\n162\n00:08:10.079 --> 00:08:14.400\nit will encrypt and decrypt going through\nthe proxy in order to facilitate access.\n\n163\n00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.140\nSo we have lots and lots of data access\nrunning through a common gateway,\n\n164\n00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.190\nif you want to think of it that way.\n\n165\n00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.960\nAnd that gateway can be an appliance.\n\n166\n00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.200\nIt could be a virtual appliance.\n\n167\n00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.790\nIt can actually be a physical appliance.\n\n168\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.430\nThere's different ways to implement this.\n\n169\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.560\nBut it's a secondary system that It is\nused essentially on behalf of multiple\n\n170\n00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.680\ntenants to be able to provide that,\nif you want to think of it that way.\n\n171\n00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.760\nKeys again could be stored in the proxy or\non the proxy.\n\n172\n00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.910\nOr they could be done through\nvia external key storage.\n\n173\n00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:42.770\nWe typically recommend that keys are\nstored externally for security reasons.\n\n174\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:47.280\nIf you are able to somehow take over\nthe proxy or take over the instance and\n\n175\n00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.890\nthe keys are local you get the keys along\nwith the instance, and that would be bad.\n\n176\n00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.090\nFrom a security perspective.\n\n177\n00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.280\nif the keys are separate and\n\n178\n00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.250\nexternal a bad actor may be\nable to take over the instance.\n\n179\n00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.030\nBut may not gain access to the keys to\nunencrypt the data in the same attack.\n\n180\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:01.160\nMakes it more complicated for\n\n181\n00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.740\nthem ultimately to execute that\nattack successfully and fully.\n\n182\n00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.180\nGaining access to the data.\n\n183\n00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.420\nRemember, in most cases, the attack is not\nreally targeting the instance itself in\n\n184\n00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.630\nthe sense that we want the Windows\n2012 R2 machine that's running,\n\n185\n00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.710\nwe really want access to that to\ngain access to the data, and so\n\n186\n00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.540\nthe data usually is the end\nresult of the attack.\n\n187\n00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.880\nAt least most successful attacks want to\nend up gaining access to the data, or\n\n188\n00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.700\nthe equivalent administrative access that\nwill open up access to other systems,\n\n189\n00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.990\nwhatever that may be.\n\n190\n00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.870\nIf it's an attack propagated specifically\nagainst data, we're really trying to get\n\n191\n00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:38.470\nto the data, we have to go through\nthe intermediary of the instance or\n\n192\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.110\nthe proxy to get in there in these\nscenarios that we're describing to you.\n\n193\n00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.290\nSo we, from a defense and\ndepth perspective, from a risk management\n\n194\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:51.180\nperspective as CCSPs, would want to\nset up either a instance based or\n\n195\n00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.830\nproxy based encryption with external\nkey management to make it exponentially\n\n196\n00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.290\nharder for the bad actors to\nessentially execute one attack and\n\n197\n00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:03.510\ngain access to both the keys and\nthe data In once, one attack or\n\n198\n00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:08.040\none hop, as opposed to multiple attacks,\nbecause the likelihood is,\n\n199\n00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.780\nas we all know, that fool me once shame\non you, fool me twice shame on me.\n\n200\n00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.380\nIf you're succesful in\nattacking one system one time,\n\n201\n00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.250\nand then have to propagate that attack\nforward to gain access to a second system\n\n202\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.640\nto gain access to the data, There's\na higher likelihood I will find you.\n\n203\n00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:22.930\nI will have more time.\n\n204\n00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.290\nI will detect you.\n\n205\n00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.310\nI may come across signs of malfeasance and\nbad behavior.\n\n206\n00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:31.150\nI may find it in my log files,\nmy security monitoring.\n\n207\n00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.730\nWhatever may be the case.\n\n208\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.690\nBut I am more likely to discover the bad\nactor the longer they stay in the system\n\n209\n00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:39.000\nand the more work they have\nto do to get what they want.\n\n210\n00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.430\nSo defense in depth becomes a really\nimportant thought process for a skier.\n\n211\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.110\n>> So Adam, setting up these hurdles,\nas they were,\n\n212\n00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.020\nis at least a two-fold benefit,\nas it gives them more complexity,\n\n213\n00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.160\nmore difficulty, to access the data that\nthey're trying to get at, and it gives\n\n214\n00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.000\nyou the extra amount of time you need to\ndiscover the fact that they've actually,\n\n215\n00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.390\nmaybe, penetrated your system, and\nare working against something else,\n\n216\n00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.350\nusing that system as a\n>> As a platform, as it were.\n\n217\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.120\n>> It would,\nit would certainly be very likely.\n\n218\n00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.740\nAnd so what we, we often talk about, and I\njust recommended, will recommend again to\n\n219\n00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.070\nbe clear, is that external key\nstorage is typically the way to go.\n\n220\n00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.130\nAnd not always, there are,\ncertainly mitigating circumstances and\n\n221\n00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:17.700\nreasons why local storage,\nwould be preferable.\n\n222\n00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.860\nAnd there are business cases, and use\ncases where we would see local storage,\n\n223\n00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.660\nmeaning inside the instance on the proxy\ndevice itself being recommended,\n\n224\n00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.180\nas opposed to remote storage.\n\n225\n00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.110\nBut in most cases, unless there are one\nof these off in the corner kind of\n\n226\n00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.860\nissues that we wanna address,\nwe are recommending,\n\n227\n00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.750\nmeaning I say,\nwe generically, the royal we.\n\n228\n00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:41.250\nThe best practice documentation\nwe often read and referred to\n\n229\n00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:45.400\nin our industry is typically coming down\nin favor of external key management,\n\n230\n00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.770\ngetting those keys separated,\nremoved, one hop or\n\n231\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.020\none layer or one whatever it is that\nyou just said that you were using.\n\n232\n00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.400\n>> Hurdle!\n>> There you go, that's the thing.\n\n233\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.140\nWhen hurdle.\n\n234\n00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.200\nIt's with an H,\nit's kinda like hop except longer.\n\n235\n00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.880\n>> Yeah, right around there.\n\n236\n00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.460\n>> You have to jump longer to get over\nthe hurdle as opposed to hopping.\n\n237\n00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.640\nSo the idea is basically that we want\nto separate the keys from the data,\n\n238\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:04.630\nif at all possible.\n\n239\n00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.010\nAnd if you think about the logic,\nas a standing rule of thumb,\n\n240\n00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:08.900\nit makes a lot of sense, right.\n\n241\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:12.060\nMake those bad actors work\nharder to get the data.\n\n242\n00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.460\nI want to, as we've talked about in prior\nepisodes, always be a little bit better\n\n243\n00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.670\nthan the people I face in terms of\nbeing better than my attackers.\n\n244\n00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.510\nIf I'm better,\nthat could mean I'm smarter.\n\n245\n00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.150\nIf I'm better,\nit could simply mean that I'm faster.\n\n246\n00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.690\nIf I'm better,\nit could mean that I'm one step ahead,\n\n247\n00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:28.810\nthat I've just planned\nbetter than you have.\n\n248\n00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.160\nAnd as a result, I've taken more\nprecautionary steps to separate you\n\n249\n00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.520\nfrom my data, then you are prepared\nto take in order to get there.\n\n250\n00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.100\nAnd as a result,\nI may win simply by attrition.\n\n251\n00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:40.040\nDoesn't matter.\n\n252\n00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.110\nI just gotta be better.\n\n253\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.110\nDoesn't matter how I get there.\n\n254\n00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.880\nI just gotta make sure that I am\nable to do that in such a way as\n\n255\n00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.200\na CC as a security professional focused on\nthe Cloud to make sure that you have to\n\n256\n00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.380\nwork as a bad actor harder than you\nare willing to to gain access to data.\n\n257\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.840\nThat is really the secret,\nthat is the key, no pun intended, right?\n\n258\n00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.350\nBut that is the key that we\nare striving ultimately to own.\n\n259\n00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.770\nObjects toward encryption,\nthe other side of the IS divide,\n\n260\n00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.765\nif you will We'll remember we're thinking\nabout the ability to use unstructured.\n\n261\n00:13:09.765 --> 00:13:10.925\nlarge volume data.\n\n262\n00:13:10.925 --> 00:13:14.715\nWe talked about music files,\ndatabase files things like that.\n\n263\n00:13:14.715 --> 00:13:16.415\nThat may get stored in object.\n\n264\n00:13:16.415 --> 00:13:20.115\nSo we want to think about the fact that\nwe have the ability to use external\n\n265\n00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:21.205\nencryption mechanisms.\n\n266\n00:13:21.205 --> 00:13:24.885\nSuch as file level encryption and\nor application level encryption.\n\n267\n00:13:24.885 --> 00:13:26.959\nPretty standard,\npretty traditional when we think about it.\n\n268\n00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:33.200\nDRM or IRM technologies are typically are\nfile or examples of file level encryption\n\n269\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.730\nso data rights management or information\nrights management technologies.\n\n270\n00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.590\nSticky attributes that\nare applied to the data\n\n271\n00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:43.580\nthat follow it wherever it goes would\nbe considered file level encryption.\n\n272\n00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.930\nFor instance think about a DRM\nsolution that would allow us to be\n\n273\n00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:55.090\nable to restrict the use of data by\npreventing it from being printed.\n\n274\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.380\nWould use or restrict the use of data\nby preventing it from being attached to\n\n275\n00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.510\nan email and\nbeing sent out of a secure system.\n\n276\n00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:07.840\nWould restrict the use of data by allowing\non-screen use and single-use read.\n\n277\n00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.420\nBut no screen capturing,\nno screen copying.\n\n278\n00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:15.730\nSo we would disable print screen and\nany of those file capture utilities,\n\n279\n00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.760\nwherever we may use,\nthat use DLLs to do that.\n\n280\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.480\nThat doesn't mean, in theory, you can't\ntake a picture of it with an external\n\n281\n00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.560\ndevice and still have access to it.\n\n282\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.750\nBut you gotta work harder.\n\n283\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.810\nAnd you really gotta go around the system.\n\n284\n00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:29.890\nThere are certain things we're just not\ngonna be able to defend against, right?\n\n285\n00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.270\nI've not yet to see a DRM system,\nthat can prevent you from using a camera,\n\n286\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.980\nexternal to the device,\ntake a picture of what's on the screen.\n\n287\n00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.850\nJust because,\nwe just don't have a way of doing that.\n\n288\n00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.910\nAt least not with today's technology.\n\n289\n00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.500\nIt's not to say it may not occur at\nsome point in the future, right.\n\n290\n00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.240\nBut right now, DRM is really\nlimited to use in the system.\n\n291\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.020\nAnd so as a result of that,\nwe may be able to\n\n292\n00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.750\nprevent you from sending that to\na remote device, such as a handheld.\n\n293\n00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.430\nMaybe a mobile phone or a laptop, right.\n\n294\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.790\nOr a, tablet, or whatever it is.\n\n295\n00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.020\nThese are examples of file\nlevel encryption techniques.\n\n296\n00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.040\nSo, wanna be thinking about this.\n\n297\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.750\nThe encryption engine, is commonly gonna\nbe implemented at the client side.\n\n298\n00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.250\nso it's running on the endpoint.\n\n299\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.540\nWhere we're accessing.\n\n300\n00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.560\nSo on the mobile device, on the tablet,\non the desktop, wherever it is.\n\n301\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.390\nAnd is gonna preserve the format,\nthe integrity, and\n\n302\n00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.120\nthe attributes of the original file,\nwherever it goes.\n\n303\n00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.160\nEarly on, we would see that attributes\nmay not stick to certain kinds of data\n\n304\n00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.770\nwhen you would transfer them.\n\n305\n00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.380\nSo you could potentially\nmove data from a secure,\n\n306\n00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.760\nencrypted partition to an unsecure,\n\n307\n00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.340\nstripping out the encryption attributes\nin certain early versions of systems.\n\n308\n00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.630\nToday, that's really not usually possible,\nbut early on, it may have been.\n\n309\n00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.670\nSo there's different ways\nthis may get applied.\n\n310\n00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:42.400\nTo regards to application level\nencryption, the application engine\n\n311\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.700\nIt's running, it's in the application\nthat is utilizing the object storage.\n\n312\n00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.528\nMaybe you've got a front end database\nthat's using that, the encryption engine,\n\n313\n00:15:51.528 --> 00:15:55.200\nthe application is aware\nan encryption is in-line, as we say,\n\n314\n00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.044\nright inside the application.\n\n315\n00:15:57.044 --> 00:15:59.850\nIt is integrated into\nthe component of the application or\n\n316\n00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.416\nsome sort of proxy that's integrated\ninto the application directly and\n\n317\n00:16:03.416 --> 00:16:06.468\nit encrypts the data before it\nmoves into and out of the Cloud.\n\n318\n00:16:06.468 --> 00:16:08.909\nSo access to the data is\nthrough the application and\n\n319\n00:16:08.909 --> 00:16:12.250\nencryption is applied at\nthe application layer right there.\n\n320\n00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:16.150\nAs a result of that, we're able to ensure\nthat every time the data is accessed,\n\n321\n00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.060\nif we're only using authorized APIs,\nauthorized applications,\n\n322\n00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:23.270\nthen encryption is ensured,\nat least in theory it should be ensured.\n\n323\n00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:26.200\nIf it's done at the application level,\nprovided that nobody is able to get to\n\n324\n00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.690\nthe data unless they use\nthe secure application.\n\n325\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.900\nSo these are all ways in which\nwe may see data being encrypted,\n\n326\n00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.320\nor at least encryption being\napplied to data, inside IaaS,\n\n327\n00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.895\nwith regards to the different kinds\nof storage that we had talked about.\n\n328\n00:16:38.895 --> 00:16:42.225\nWith regards to database encryption,\nI just mentioned data, databases,\n\n329\n00:16:42.225 --> 00:16:44.455\nand application aware encryption.\n\n330\n00:16:44.455 --> 00:16:46.765\nWe do see file level\nencryptions as we talked about.\n\n331\n00:16:46.765 --> 00:16:48.995\nWe do see application level encryption,\nbut remember,\n\n332\n00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:51.135\nwe also see transport encryption, right?\n\n333\n00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:56.420\nData at rest, data in use,\ndata in transport, or data on the wire.\n\n334\n00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:00.130\nWe have to think about all three, we keep\ncoming back to these states of data.\n\n335\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.890\nIt's very important for you as a CCSP,\n\n336\n00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.620\nis a Cloud Security Certified\nProfessional, and as a CSP.\n\n337\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.040\nThose of you out there that may work for\ncloud service providers or for\n\n338\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.890\nISPs that are now being\nbranded as CSPs because\n\n339\n00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.758\nessentially they are one in the same\nin being respects, although not in all.\n\n340\n00:17:17.758 --> 00:17:20.980\nCuz you maybe an ISP, but\nyou may not provide cloud services,\n\n341\n00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.505\nyou may simply provide bandwidth.\n\n342\n00:17:22.505 --> 00:17:25.485\nBut many ISPs are also\nproviding cloud services today.\n\n343\n00:17:25.485 --> 00:17:28.815\nSo the reality is if you work on\nthe service side of the industry, right?\n\n344\n00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:32.595\nYou have to be worried about being\na provider and taking on the liability and\n\n345\n00:17:32.595 --> 00:17:36.482\nresponsibility of providing encryption at\nthe hardware level and perhaps through\n\n346\n00:17:36.482 --> 00:17:39.152\nadditional levels all the way up\nthrough SaaS depending on what you do.\n\n347\n00:17:39.152 --> 00:17:42.782\nIf you're a customer you have to worry\nabout the liability and responsibility of\n\n348\n00:17:42.782 --> 00:17:46.682\nproviding encryption again depending\non the service model you consume in.\n\n349\n00:17:46.682 --> 00:17:50.481\nEither at the hardware level, at\nthe intermediary level at the management\n\n350\n00:17:50.481 --> 00:17:53.861\ndata plane level or all the way up in\nthe application level depending on SaaS,\n\n351\n00:17:53.861 --> 00:17:56.281\nPaaS or IaaS and how you consume.\n\n352\n00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:59.241\nThe challenge there is that\ncustomers really have no visibility\n\n353\n00:17:59.241 --> 00:18:01.361\ninto most of the encryption techniques and\n\n354\n00:18:01.361 --> 00:18:04.721\ntechnologies being used at the higher\nlevels of these service models.\n\n355\n00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:07.761\nWe've talked about the fact that in SaaS\nwe have to rely totally on the vendor.\n\n356\n00:18:07.761 --> 00:18:10.891\nWe literally have no way of understanding\ndirectly what's happening nor\n\n357\n00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:12.350\ndo we control it directly.\n\n358\n00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:13.880\nSo this is something to consider.\n\n359\n00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.940\nI had asked Daniel to bring\nup a URL earlier, I know and\n\n360\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.732\nI think he's done that.\n\n361\n00:18:17.732 --> 00:18:20.490\nWe wanna take a look at his screen if we\ncould, and could we go full screen and\n\n362\n00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.820\njust go to that real quick,\ncuz you don't wanna see me,\n\n363\n00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.230\nyou wanna see what's on the list.\n\n364\n00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:29.190\nSo this is something that, is just\na sample of the kind of information that\n\n365\n00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:33.820\nyou as a customer, and\nyou as a CCSP advising customers, will\n\n366\n00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.320\npotentially wanna be available or have\navailable and be aware of and look at.\n\n367\n00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.660\nThis is from Microsoft from\ntheir Office 365 website.\n\n368\n00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.600\nThey offer a series of top\nten lists about things that\n\n369\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.180\ncustomers may be interested in.\n\n370\n00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:48.280\nThe one that is of interest to us,\nthe one that we want to look at\n\n371\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.840\nis the very first one, the top questions\nthat we should all ask our cloud service\n\n372\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.080\nprovider when you are considering\nrather or not we wanna host with that.\n\n373\n00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.500\nAnd so as you scroll down a little bit,\nwhat we'll do is, I'll just narrate.\n\n374\n00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.190\nI know it's probably something\nthat people can see on the screen.\n\n375\n00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.180\nAnd so what you have there, right?\n\n376\n00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.110\nIs you have questions like, who owns\nthe data we store on your services?\n\n377\n00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:10.660\nThis is you as you as a customer, right?\n\n378\n00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.950\nYou as a security professional\ninteracting with the cloud vendor and\n\n379\n00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.490\nasking them questions, right?\n\n380\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.030\nWho will use your data or\n\n381\n00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.540\nwho uses our data meaning customer's\ndata to build advertising products.\n\n382\n00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.632\nSo they give you a little statement\nof the fact that as a customer\n\n383\n00:19:23.632 --> 00:19:24.570\nyou always own your data.\n\n384\n00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.630\nWell, we know that, that's good, okay.\n\n385\n00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:27.830\nBut some of the other things.\n\n386\n00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.970\nDo you offer privacy\ncontrols on your service?\n\n387\n00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.790\nAbsolutely, enabled by default,\nyou could turn them on and off.\n\n388\n00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.290\nWe contractually commit to robust privacy.\n\n389\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.190\nSo there's an SLA implication there,\nright?\n\n390\n00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.230\nIt's in the SLA.\n\n391\n00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:40.710\nGreat, notice there's not\na lot of detail here.\n\n392\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.790\nYeah, we're making a statement.\n\n393\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.030\nSure we provide that.\n\n394\n00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.499\nWant the details, it says?\n\n395\n00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:48.430\nYou'll have to read our hosting\nagreements or in certain cases and\n\n396\n00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.770\ncertain questions click here to follow up.\n\n397\n00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.330\nDo we have visibility into\nwhere you store our data?\n\n398\n00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.980\nWe've talked a lot about geo\npreferencing for data storage.\n\n399\n00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.940\nWe are transparent it says for\nmore information please visit.\n\n400\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.740\nWhere is my data in\nthe Office 365 trust center?\n\n401\n00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.740\nAnd if you click on that link the where\nis my data link and you go and\n\n402\n00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.530\nyou take a look,\nyou'll see that we could select by region.\n\n403\n00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.410\nAnd actually if you pull it up\nyou'll see the data hosting at\n\n404\n00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.560\nleast currently anyway.\n\n405\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.920\nThe data hosting map there for\nwhere data can be put.\n\n406\n00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.455\nYou'll notice there's data hosting\ncapabilities in Australia,\n\n407\n00:20:21.455 --> 00:20:26.070\nthere's in Latin America,\ncertainly in South America down there,\n\n408\n00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:29.503\nNorth America, over in Asia and\nLatham in Africa.\n\n409\n00:20:29.503 --> 00:20:33.741\nNotice there's nothing per se, but\nup in Europe and over in Asia there is.\n\n410\n00:20:33.741 --> 00:20:37.108\nSo we do have these capabilities,\nand if you notice if you hover,\n\n411\n00:20:37.108 --> 00:20:39.561\nyou actually just randomly\npick a red circle and\n\n412\n00:20:39.561 --> 00:20:42.762\nhover, you'll get essentially\nthe country name right?\n\n413\n00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:45.262\nOr the location where\nthat particular area is.\n\n414\n00:20:45.262 --> 00:20:48.602\nMalaysia, Hong Kong, Japan,\nin Asia for instance.\n\n415\n00:20:48.602 --> 00:20:51.242\nThe United States by region,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n416\n00:20:51.242 --> 00:20:52.166\nSo you'll get the country.\n\n417\n00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:55.946\nIreland, I think I mentioned in one of our\nprior episodes early on, that you know,\n\n418\n00:20:55.946 --> 00:20:58.576\nMicrosoft has their data\ncenters in Europe and\n\n419\n00:20:58.576 --> 00:21:00.616\nIreland is one of their main hubs, right?\n\n420\n00:21:00.616 --> 00:21:02.896\nSo we could see that, and\nwe can understand that.\n\n421\n00:21:02.896 --> 00:21:05.913\nNotice you can't go down below that,\nin the sense that if you click,\n\n422\n00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:09.473\nyou can't get into North America,\nand see where the data centers are.\n\n423\n00:21:09.473 --> 00:21:10.903\nIt's not hard to figure\nout where they are.\n\n424\n00:21:10.903 --> 00:21:14.053\nBut you just, you don't see that, but\nyou see a general all out view, right.\n\n425\n00:21:14.053 --> 00:21:16.863\nThey happen to have one east coast, middle\nof the country, and west coast, right.\n\n426\n00:21:16.863 --> 00:21:18.873\nSo you can get a sense\nof what that looks like.\n\n427\n00:21:18.873 --> 00:21:20.453\nThere's one in Chicago, for instance.\n\n428\n00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:22.283\nThat's roughly, in the middle of the US.\n\n429\n00:21:22.283 --> 00:21:25.163\nSo, you get the general idea\nof what's happening here, and\n\n430\n00:21:25.163 --> 00:21:28.290\nwe can see, that there is transparency,\nabsolutely.\n\n431\n00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:29.680\nYou have question number four, right?\n\n432\n00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.450\nIf we go back to the list real quick.\n\n433\n00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.850\nWhat is your approach to security and\nwhat security features do you offer\n\n434\n00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.650\nto protect us from external and\ninternal attacks?\n\n435\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:42.800\nThey categorize based on built-in\nsecurity and customer controls.\n\n436\n00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.570\nBuilt in security are all the measures\nwe as the provide take it says.\n\n437\n00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.860\nAnd then customer controls or\nfeatures that you as the customer\n\n438\n00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:55.150\nenabled to turn on in order to customize\nhow you want Office 365 to be consumed.\n\n439\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:58.310\nHow do we get data out of your\nservice in question number five.\n\n440\n00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.530\nYou always have right to do that.\n\n441\n00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.670\nYou have the ability to take\nyour data with you during\n\n442\n00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.380\nthe N498s after you subscription.\n\n443\n00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.940\nYou can download a copy of your data,\nso this is important.\n\n444\n00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.270\nData's maintained for 90 days after\nyou off board from the platform,\n\n445\n00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.160\nin case you wanna come back and get it.\n\n446\n00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.440\nAt the end of that time,\nyou then are able to essentially assume,\n\n447\n00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.260\nand you never assume, you wanna\nvalidate this, but Microsoft tells you\n\n448\n00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.460\nthat they will securely get rid off or\ndelete your data at that point.\n\n449\n00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.140\nSo they have a 90 day retention\nperiod post-offboarding.\n\n450\n00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.040\nYou would wanna know that as a customer,\nthat's pretty important.\n\n451\n00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.810\nAmazon has similar terms, so does Google.\n\n452\n00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:35.460\nThis is not unusual by any\nmeans in the industry.\n\n453\n00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.810\n>> Do they do that for backup purposes\nin case you didn't download it properly.\n\n454\n00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:42.020\nAnd you thought, now I found some data\ncorruption I can go back to Microsoft and\n\n455\n00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.000\nget my data still.\n\n456\n00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.720\n>> They do it primarily for that.\n\n457\n00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.130\nThey essentially don't want to be sued,\nright?\n\n458\n00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.930\nFrom a liability perspective.\n\n459\n00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.540\nHey I off boarded you gave me a copy or\nallowed me to download my data.\n\n460\n00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:57.740\nI didn't find out for 45 days the download\nwas corrupt or whatever that was.\n\n461\n00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.300\nAnd I'm coming back and suing you\nbecause you Mr. Provider screwed up.\n\n462\n00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.990\nSo hey no, we didn't screw up.\n\n463\n00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.210\nYou had 90 days,\nthat's sufficient time, quote unquote.\n\n464\n00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:11.000\nWe met the legal burden of giving\nyou access, post-contract,\n\n465\n00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.561\nto ensure that you, Mr. Customer or Mrs.\n\n466\n00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:17.700\nCustomer, have the ability multiple times\nif necessary to download that data.\n\n467\n00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:18.830\nAt the end of that period,\n\n468\n00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.800\nif you haven't done it by then,\nit's no longer our responsibility.\n\n469\n00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.872\nI mean, I'm being brutally honest with\nyou, but that's really why they do\n\n470\n00:23:24.872 --> 00:23:27.992\nit that way because they don't want a\ncustomer to come back five days later and\n\n471\n00:23:27.992 --> 00:23:30.542\nsay, hey, you didn't give me good time,\ngood opportunity.\n\n472\n00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:33.771\nI've got terabytes of data and\nI can't get it down in five days and\n\n473\n00:23:33.771 --> 00:23:35.190\nyou essentially cut it off.\n\n474\n00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.700\nThey don't wanna get sued.\n\n475\n00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.680\nBut that's, we'll go with the better and\nmore politically correct interpretation.\n\n476\n00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.920\nThey're being nice people and so\n\n477\n00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.430\nthey're providing access for\na long period of time, right?\n\n478\n00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.920\nAre you transparent the way you\nuse an access or data, right?\n\n479\n00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.300\nWill you inform us when\nthings change in the service?\n\n480\n00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.730\nQuestion six and seven.\n\n481\n00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.490\nAbsolutely, we always inform you as\nto what's going on, they tell you.\n\n482\n00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.030\nWhat kind of commitments do you have\nin respect to security and privacy?\n\n483\n00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.860\nThis is one of the ones you always want\nto focus on, question number eight.\n\n484\n00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.037\nYou'll see that they list there\nwhat standards they comply with.\n\n485\n00:24:05.037 --> 00:24:09.894\nISO 27001, you've heard me reference\nthat couple of times, ISO 27018 One of\n\n486\n00:24:09.894 --> 00:24:14.058\nthe other ISO standards is very important\nfor data protection and privacy.\n\n487\n00:24:14.058 --> 00:24:18.345\nFISMA, so the information processing\nstandards here in the US.\n\n488\n00:24:18.345 --> 00:24:21.770\nFedRAMPwhich is the US governments\ncloud security standards for\n\n489\n00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:23.720\ntheir environment, right?\n\n490\n00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.840\nSo we've got all of that.\n\n491\n00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.400\nThey're also independently verified.\n\n492\n00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.820\nAnd you'll notice there's a \"please\nvisit the independently verified section\n\n493\n00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.430\nof the Office 365 Trust Center\".\n\n494\n00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.660\nWhen you click through that link,\nwhat will come up and what you will find\n\n495\n00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.150\nis that there are attestation statements\nfrom vendors that will allow us\n\n496\n00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:43.920\nto be able to understand, you'll see them\nthere, we're at continuous compliance.\n\n497\n00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.520\nAside from all the marketing stuff, if you\nscroll down just a little bit below that,\n\n498\n00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.220\nyou'll see that there is independent\nverification, you can open that up or\n\n499\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.570\nclick on that plus sign.\n\n500\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.730\nAnd you'll notice that they\nspecify what data privacy rights,\n\n501\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.850\nor requirements they meet.\n\n502\n00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:02.190\nSo HIPAA, BAA, FISMA,\nthe EU Model Clauses,\n\n503\n00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.595\nwhich are essentially going to\nup under the privacy directives.\n\n504\n00:25:05.595 --> 00:25:06.365\nActive approach.\n\n505\n00:25:06.365 --> 00:25:08.055\nRegulatory compliance.\n\n506\n00:25:08.055 --> 00:25:12.715\nThey have over 900 industry standard\ncontrols that kind of thing.\n\n507\n00:25:12.715 --> 00:25:15.865\nAnd customer controls\nthat we talk about DLP.\n\n508\n00:25:15.865 --> 00:25:17.375\nWe talk about data loss prevention.\n\n509\n00:25:17.375 --> 00:25:18.997\nDLP is listed there.\n\n510\n00:25:18.997 --> 00:25:22.117\nThey talk about legal hold and\ne-discovery being available.\n\n511\n00:25:22.117 --> 00:25:25.517\nElectronically stored information\nis packaged and managed,\n\n512\n00:25:25.517 --> 00:25:28.787\nwhat we call ESI, is packaged and\nmanaged the right way for\n\n513\n00:25:28.787 --> 00:25:30.877\nlegal requests and or\ninvestigative purposes.\n\n514\n00:25:30.877 --> 00:25:33.857\nSo they go into great detail and\ntell you what you need.\n\n515\n00:25:33.857 --> 00:25:36.197\nAnd then what is the commitment\nregarding my service upkeep?\n\n516\n00:25:36.197 --> 00:25:38.987\nIf you go back, very last question\nthere down at the bottom,\n\n517\n00:25:38.987 --> 00:25:41.527\nthat's where we see the commitments\nuptime that I talked about.\n\n518\n00:25:41.527 --> 00:25:42.758\nThe three nine uptime.\n\n519\n00:25:42.758 --> 00:25:47.410\nWe offer 99.9 uptime via a financially\nservice backed guarantee.\n\n520\n00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.440\nThat is our SLA committment right there.\n\n521\n00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.140\nSo you know, we can see that all of these\nthings are documented out by the vendor.\n\n522\n00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.795\nAnd again if you went to Google,\nyou went to Amazon,\n\n523\n00:25:56.795 --> 00:26:00.475\nif you went to any of these areas,\nor any of these providers rather,\n\n524\n00:26:00.475 --> 00:26:02.805\nyou would see that they have\nsimilar terms of service.\n\n525\n00:26:02.805 --> 00:26:06.805\nMeaning they may not be 90 days, maybe\nthey provide 75 days or whatever it is.\n\n526\n00:26:06.805 --> 00:26:10.065\nBut it's gonna be generally in\nalignment with what we see.\n\n527\n00:26:10.065 --> 00:26:12.395\nRemember, the industry\nis kind of converging.\n\n528\n00:26:12.395 --> 00:26:14.315\nEverybody has a sense of what\neverybody else is doing.\n\n529\n00:26:14.315 --> 00:26:16.395\nThis is pretty standardized stuff today.\n\n530\n00:26:16.395 --> 00:26:20.060\nThis is not the wild west frontier\nit was five, ten years ago\n\n531\n00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.100\nwhere you had vendors all over the place,\ndoing pretty much whatever they wanted.\n\n532\n00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:25.656\nThis is kind of like going out and\nbuying blue jeans.\n\n533\n00:26:25.656 --> 00:26:27.690\nDo they call them blue jeans anymore?\n\n534\n00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.535\nI just call them jeans,\ncall them dungarees?\n\n535\n00:26:29.535 --> 00:26:30.248\nI'll date myself.\n\n536\n00:26:30.248 --> 00:26:31.336\n[CROSSTALK] You call them dungarees?\n\n537\n00:26:31.336 --> 00:26:32.623\nDungarees are cool.\n\n538\n00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:34.189\nYou don't hear dungarees anymore.\n\n539\n00:26:34.189 --> 00:26:35.700\n>> That almost sounds like Australian.\n\n540\n00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:38.850\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, it's like a dinky doo or\n\n541\n00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:39.900\nwhatever they call it.\n\n542\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:43.290\nBut when you buy jeans,\nyears ago when you bought jeans,\n\n543\n00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.010\na label actually meant something.\n\n544\n00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.960\nYou bought Levis, or you bought Polo,\nor whatever, you were buying a brand.\n\n545\n00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.680\nToday, denim is denim.\n\n546\n00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.850\nCloth.\nCloth is cloth.\n\n547\n00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:53.390\nThe label you slap on it,\n\n548\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:57.500\nis all put on somewhere wherever they're\nall manufactured, but the reality is it's\n\n549\n00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.260\njust a label it doesn't really mean\nnecessarily you're getting any better or\n\n550\n00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.250\nworse quality, it really just means\nyou're buying somebody's name.\n\n551\n00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:07.550\nWhere years ago it actually meant you\nwere buying a better quality of garment.\n\n552\n00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:09.820\nSo as a result of that,\nit's really commoditized, and\n\n553\n00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.740\nthat's really what cloud is becoming.\n\n554\n00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:13.470\nIt's a commoditized consumable, and\n\n555\n00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.420\neverybody is pretty much providing\nthe same level of service.\n\n556\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.140\nThere are certainly differences.\n\n557\n00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.300\nThere are capabilities to buy and\ngain additional value through investment.\n\n558\n00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:25.560\nBut at the base level as you enter,\nessentially it's all the same.\n\n559\n00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.510\nYou get an SLA, we document out\nthese things, and this is more or\n\n560\n00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.590\nless what we do.\n\n561\n00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.770\nSo database encryption,\nmake sure we understand the CCSPs,\n\n562\n00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:36.760\nfile level, transport level,\nas well as application level.\n\n563\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.650\nMeaning, when we think about this,\n\n564\n00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:43.100\nright, we're thinking about data in use,\ndata at rest, data on the wire.\n\n565\n00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.420\nWe have to be thinking about\nwhere we apply encryption.\n\n566\n00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.000\nWe also as we set up to\nthink about key management.\n\n567\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.020\nOur preference is to look for external key\nmanagement with any of these instances and\n\n568\n00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:53.880\ntrying to force that or\nthink through that.\n\n569\n00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.910\nSo we have to think about access to\nthe keys, have to think about key storage,\n\n570\n00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:59.144\nhave to think about back up and\nreplication of keys.\n\n571\n00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:00.940\nWhen we think about key management,\n\n572\n00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.660\nwe have to think about\nthe essential protection.\n\n573\n00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.230\nThe life-cycle of the key from the time it\nis generated all the way through usage.\n\n574\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.310\nThrough storage during usage and\nultimately out through disposal.\n\n575\n00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.170\nSo we have to think about whose\ngoing to have rights to the key, or\n\n576\n00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.740\nkeys if there's more than one.\n\n577\n00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.230\nSo this is access control right.\n\n578\n00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.250\nAnd how are we going\nto control those keys.\n\n579\n00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.430\nIt's really going to be a question\nof who gets to see the data.\n\n580\n00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.630\nBecause it's not access to the data\nthat is really what we control.\n\n581\n00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.820\nIt's access to the keys that\naccess the data through decryption\n\n582\n00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.020\nthat we have to worry about.\n\n583\n00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.700\nKey storage.\n\n584\n00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.850\nWhere are the keys stored?\n\n585\n00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:34.100\nIf the keys are not stored securely\nthen anybody can get a hold of them.\n\n586\n00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:37.570\nYou ever walk in and find like you know\nsomebody's keys laying on the table and\n\n587\n00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.630\nwonder whose they are and\nwhat they're good for?\n\n588\n00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:41.340\nRight.\nThat kind of stuff happens.\n\n589\n00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.250\nProverbial as well as literally.\n\n590\n00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.813\nSo if people leave keys lying around,\nif they're not secured,\n\n591\n00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:48.210\nthey can be compromised and\nsomebody can take them.\n\n592\n00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.670\nBackup and replication.\n\n593\n00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.370\nAre we storing the keys securely.\n\n594\n00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.320\nCheck that box off.\n\n595\n00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.080\nAre we access controlling the keys?\n\n596\n00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.220\nCheck that box off.\n\n597\n00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.920\nWhat about making sure the keys can\nbe recovered if there's a problem?\n\n598\n00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.690\nWhat about where those keys stored when\nthey're backed up not just during active\n\n599\n00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.350\nuse but\nthe safeguarding of the backed up copies.\n\n600\n00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.260\nWe may or may not check off that box.\n\n601\n00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.370\nAre we replicating the keys?\n\n602\n00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:11.650\nSo are they being pushed out to multiple\nlocations so if they are secure.\n\n603\n00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:13.730\nAre you familiar with EFS?\n\n604\n00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.480\nAnd how EFS encryption file\nsystem works in Windows?\n\n605\n00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.918\n>> Yeah I'm familiar with it.\n\n606\n00:29:17.918 --> 00:29:21.820\nI'm not 100% on how it works per say but\nI do know of it.\n\n607\n00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.760\n>> All right.\nSo you know if you think of EFS and\n\n608\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.390\ngenerically the idea is that we're\napplying file level encryption to data\n\n609\n00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:29.870\nwithin the Windows operating system.\n\n610\n00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:33.490\nAnd the idea there is that every file\nhas an encryption attribute that we\n\n611\n00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:34.500\ncan turn on.\n\n612\n00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.610\nAnd then we can use a key based\nencryption and encrypt the key.\n\n613\n00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.440\nAs the data owner I can decide whether or\nnot the file is encrypted.\n\n614\n00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.770\nIf so\nyou have to have rights to the file and\n\n615\n00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.530\nessentially have a copy\nof the key to see it.\n\n616\n00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.080\nSo I can give that to you\nby giving you a copy or\n\n617\n00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.440\nI can restrict you from seeing\nit by not letting you have it.\n\n618\n00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.660\nIt's really up to me.\n\n619\n00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:55.980\nThe point is that that key is literally\nthe key that opens up the file.\n\n620\n00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.490\nSo looking at the data without\nthe proper credential,\n\n621\n00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:01.750\nbecause the keys are tied to\nthe user account inside Windows in\n\n622\n00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.450\nthe Active Directory,\nmeans you cannot see the data.\n\n623\n00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.470\nYou see it, but you can't unencrypt it.\n\n624\n00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.950\nInterestingly though,\nthere's a recovery option.\n\n625\n00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.090\nSo with EFS, like all good\nencryption systems, we have an oops,\n\n626\n00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.460\nI made a mistake option.\n\n627\n00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.240\nAnd if I lose the key what do I do?\n\n628\n00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:18.200\nSo we have a skeleton key,\nessentially a master key that can\n\n629\n00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.730\nopen up any piece of encrypted data\ninside the directory made by any user.\n\n630\n00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.570\nThat master key is assigned to every\npiece of data that you encrypt.\n\n631\n00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:29.450\nThe active directory,\ndirectory service maintains it and\n\n632\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:33.090\nit is the rights to it is assigned by\ndefault to the domain administrator.\n\n633\n00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:37.450\nWhich means the domain admin has the right\nto come in behind any user and decrypt and\n\n634\n00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.240\nopen up and see their files, whether or\nnot that user is present, whether or\n\n635\n00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.500\nnot that user has given permission,\nas a recovery option, so\n\n636\n00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.020\nthat we can always see data and get it\nback even if the key is compromised or\n\n637\n00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:49.460\nthe user account has been removed.\n\n638\n00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:54.160\nSo it's a master recovery key that\nthe operating system itself builds in, and\n\n639\n00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.900\nit's stored securely as part of the user\naccount information associated with\n\n640\n00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.730\nthe domain admin account,\n\n641\n00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:01.150\nor the enterprise admin if it's\ngoing to be in the forest.\n\n642\n00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:05.640\nSo, want to think about this and\nwant to understand that key recovery and\n\n643\n00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.920\nthe ability to backup and\nrestore keys is also equally important.\n\n644\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.780\nThe CCSP has to be aware of and understand\nthese issues and these concerns.\n\n645\n00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.855\nIt's going to be very critical for\nour ability to be successful.\n\n646\n00:31:15.855 --> 00:31:17.415\nSo what do worry about\nwith key management?\n\n647\n00:31:17.415 --> 00:31:21.195\nCertainly, random number generation with\nregards to the keys to make sure the keys\n\n648\n00:31:21.195 --> 00:31:23.085\nare random and\nthat they are not synchronous.\n\n649\n00:31:23.085 --> 00:31:26.235\nThey are not going to follow a sequence or\na pattern that's easily discernible.\n\n650\n00:31:26.235 --> 00:31:28.975\nSomebody can guess them and\nthen attack the keys.\n\n651\n00:31:28.975 --> 00:31:33.030\nMaking sure that we never\ntransmit the keys in the clear.\n\n652\n00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:35.820\nYou talked in I think it was the last\nepisode about the use of SSH,\n\n653\n00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:39.360\nmaking sure we transmit securely,\nwe encrypt the data.\n\n654\n00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.245\nDon't transmit using non-secure protocols,\nnon-secure applications.\n\n655\n00:31:43.245 --> 00:31:46.595\nWe talk about keys, we actually talk\nabout something with cryptography and\n\n656\n00:31:46.595 --> 00:31:50.285\nkey management, known as Kerckhoffs's\nprinciple or Kerckhoffs's law.\n\n657\n00:31:50.285 --> 00:31:53.516\nAuguste Kerckhoffs was very famous,\nmathematician and\n\n658\n00:31:53.516 --> 00:31:57.621\none of the early people that was very\nheavily involved in the creation and\n\n659\n00:31:57.621 --> 00:32:00.260\nthe thought processes around cryptography.\n\n660\n00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.600\nAnd, one of the things that he proffered\nbecame known as essentially, or was named\n\n661\n00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.014\nafter him, which was this idea, that in\na crypto system, everything can be known.\n\n662\n00:32:09.014 --> 00:32:13.467\nMeaning, the message, The encrypted data,\nthe plain text data, the algorithm used\n\n663\n00:32:13.467 --> 00:32:17.676\nto do the encryption, the entire system\nitself can be made available to anybody,\n\n664\n00:32:17.676 --> 00:32:19.750\ngood or bad actors, irrelevant.\n\n665\n00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.170\nThe only thing that must be kept secret\nand that you must unequivocally,\n\n666\n00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:27.440\nwithout any fail, always keep secret,\nkeep hidden from that actors is the key.\n\n667\n00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.390\nIf you keep the key secret,\nkeep the key secure.\n\n668\n00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.250\nEverything else can be known.\n\n669\n00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.460\nAnd the crypto system,\nif implemented correctly,\n\n670\n00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:36.500\nfollowing this principle,\nshould not be compromisable.\n\n671\n00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.760\nAs long as the key is strong enough,\n\n672\n00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:41.210\nthe workspace is big enough, and\nthe work factor will be so long.\n\n673\n00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.990\nIt will take so long for you to find that\nkey that it's highly unlikely you'll break\n\n674\n00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:48.270\nthe cryptography of and\nwhat is a reasonable amount of time.\n\n675\n00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.230\nA lot more to it than that.\n\n676\n00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:50.760\nI'm just very simplistically and very,\n\n677\n00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:54.920\nvery simply restating the general\nconcepts we talked about in cryptography.\n\n678\n00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.330\nBut the idea is the same.\n\n679\n00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:59.150\nYou keep the key secure and\nyou don't expose the key,\n\n680\n00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.850\nthe likelihood of the encrypted data being\ncompromised goes down from adequate.\n\n681\n00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.100\nWe're not saying it will go away,\nwe are saying, simply,\n\n682\n00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.500\nthat you're managing risk\ndown to an acceptable level.\n\n683\n00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.170\nSo we want to make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n684\n00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:12.790\nMaking sure we use key escrow\nservices that are going to be vetted.\n\n685\n00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.700\nSo we're not gonna trust some\nfly-by-night, drive through the parking\n\n686\n00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:19.370\nlot and say, hey, I've got key escrow for\nsale, right, two for one special.\n\n687\n00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.610\nWe want to have somebody who's reputable,\nright?\n\n688\n00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.540\nSo, we want to go with a vendor\nthat we know we can rely on.\n\n689\n00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.490\nA lack of access to the encryption\nkeys results in lack of\n\n690\n00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:29.070\naccess to encrypted data.\n\n691\n00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:32.890\nSo if we lose the keys and we don't have a\nbackup, we're essentially are out of luck.\n\n692\n00:33:32.890 --> 00:33:35.340\nSo make sure you are aware of that and\nthink about that as well.\n\n693\n00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.480\nAnd as we talked about,\nkey management should,\n\n694\n00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.090\nwhenever possible, always be done\nseparately from the cloud platform,\n\n695\n00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.640\nexternal to the encryption engine or\nappliance.\n\n696\n00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.290\nAnd if possible,\nseparate from the cloud vendor.\n\n697\n00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:51.100\nCloud vendors will tell you in moments of\ncandor that they don't want responsibility\n\n698\n00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.630\nfor key management if they\nalready have responsibility for\n\n699\n00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.690\nmaintaining your data and encrypting it.\n\n700\n00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:59.510\nThey would rather not hold both pieces\nof the puzzle because the reality is,\n\n701\n00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:03.600\nwhen the attack comes, if it is\nsuccessful, it's clearly their fault.\n\n702\n00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.560\nWhereas, if you separate the two,\nit's highly unlikely,\n\n703\n00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.090\nas we talked about that two\nattacks will occur simultaneously\n\n704\n00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.380\nagainst different points\nof the infrastructure and\n\n705\n00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.120\nbe successful at the same time, rendering\nthe key and the data both compromised.\n\n706\n00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.220\nSo if you separate the keys from the data,\nmeaning cloud provider owns and\n\n707\n00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.860\nencrypts the data, right?\n\n708\n00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.690\nCustomer owns the keys and\n\n709\n00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:28.520\nthe two shall never meet except during\nactive use on regulated conditions.\n\n710\n00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.800\nIt's a lot more likely\nthe data will stay secure.\n\n711\n00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.320\nAnd so cloud providers will tell\nyou they'd rather not own the keys,\n\n712\n00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.430\nthey'd rather not have them.\n\n713\n00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:34.960\nTake them.\n\n714\n00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.211\nWhen you generate the AWS,\nwhen you generate them in Azure,\n\n715\n00:34:38.211 --> 00:34:41.210\nwe give them to you and\nsay, hey, download them.\n\n716\n00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.910\nWe don't want them.\n\n717\n00:34:41.910 --> 00:34:44.660\nAnd by the way,\nif you lose them, good luck.\n\n718\n00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.470\nRight?\n[LAUGH] Get back in touch with us when you\n\n719\n00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.550\nwanna encrypt some more data cuz\nwe'll have another space for\n\n720\n00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.730\nyou cuz we have no way of\nrecovering those keys.\n\n721\n00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:52.320\nThat's what the cloud\nprovider will tell you\n\n722\n00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.840\nbecause they don't wanna\nknow what they are.\n\n723\n00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.490\nAnd if you think about the risk\nmanagement involved with that\n\n724\n00:34:56.490 --> 00:34:58.610\nit makes perfectly good sense\nfrom their perspective.\n\n725\n00:34:58.610 --> 00:34:59.890\nIt's the right way to go.\n\n726\n00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.720\nThe CCSPs that are advising\nthem are doing their job.\n\n727\n00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.050\nThey're acting with due care and\ndue diligence.\n\n728\n00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:10.220\nYou as a customer, you as a CCSP advising\ncustomers need to operate the same way.\n\n729\n00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.200\nEmbrace and understand the value\nof key separation from data.\n\n730\n00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.910\nAnd then incorporate that\nthrough policy and process and\n\n731\n00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:19.710\nprocedure into your thought process,\nyour architecture, and\n\n732\n00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:23.200\nyour application of data security\ncontrols into your platform.\n\n733\n00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.580\nBecomes very,\nvery important when you think about that.\n\n734\n00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.310\nSo when we are wrapping up\nour conversation around\n\n735\n00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.090\nthe encryption protections, right,\nand thinking about how they work.\n\n736\n00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:35.520\nKey storage in the cloud really\nbecomes one of the focal points.\n\n737\n00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:39.020\nInternal management of key storage,\nexternal management of third,\n\n738\n00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:43.030\nof key storage, third-party management\nof key storage are your options.\n\n739\n00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.210\nYou can own them internally,\nyou can externally manage them,\n\n740\n00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:51.110\nyou can give them to a third-party trusted\noutside both organizations to do the job.\n\n741\n00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.940\nYou have to think through logically\nwhat makes the most sense, but\n\n742\n00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.030\nultimately, you gotta come up with a plan.\n\n743\n00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:57.310\nAnd as a CCSP,\n\n744\n00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:01.310\nit's gonna fall to you more often\nthan not to advise on how to do that.\n\n745\n00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:04.700\nWe talked about cloud service providers,\nif they have to,\n\n746\n00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.820\nprotecting the keys of their own accord.\n\n747\n00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.500\nUsing their own systems, but\nwe also talked about the preference for\n\n748\n00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.680\nexternal hosting, and the management, or\n\n749\n00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.580\nrather the preference to give them to you,\nright, as the customer.\n\n750\n00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:17.890\nAnd to be available, or rather to\nbe able to walk away from them and\n\n751\n00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.600\nnot have to own them.\n\n752\n00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.880\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nwhat's going on on this platform.\n\n753\n00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.310\nWanna make sure we understand the ways in\nwhich encryption can be brought to bear,\n\n754\n00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:28.250\nand the importance of key\nmanagement in this whole discussion\n\n755\n00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:29.740\naround the enterprise architecture.\n\n756\n00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.650\nWith regards to security,\nvery, very important.\n\n757\n00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.150\n>> Adam, obviously encryption and key\nmanagement especially inside of a cloud or\n\n758\n00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:37.575\nreally any system to be honest with you.\n\n759\n00:36:37.575 --> 00:36:39.850\nWhat we're talking about\ncloud specifically, so\n\n760\n00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.440\nI'll go there, inside of our cloud\nenvironments are very, very important.\n\n761\n00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.380\nIt seems like it comes down\nto a lot about the scenario.\n\n762\n00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:52.730\nIt's not a one size fits all, it's a what\nis my option because of my environment.\n\n763\n00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:54.910\nThat's what's gonna\ndictate how you can do it.\n\n764\n00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:56.270\nWe do have best practices.\n\n765\n00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:58.860\nYou've done a great job of\nexplaining what those are and\n\n766\n00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:03.590\nhow they start to unfold themselves for\nus as we get into this topic.\n\n767\n00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:05.920\nBut we are running short on time for\nthis episode.\n\n768\n00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.270\nWe do thank you for explaining this stuff.\n\n769\n00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:10.040\nIt's a very complex topic.\n\n770\n00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.920\nIt's not any kind of light business,\nthat's for sure.\n\n771\n00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.480\nYou have to take a very broad approach and\n\n772\n00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.140\na focused look at your environment\nto find that right solution.\n\n773\n00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.090\nHow can we implement encryption?\n\n774\n00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:25.220\nHow can we implement the correct type of\nkey management system for our environment?\n\n775\n00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.540\nThat's what it's all about so hopefully\nyou got that out of today's episode.\n\n776\n00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.760\nAgain we thank you, Adam.\n\n777\n00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.456\nWe thank you guys for dropping by but\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign off

Mini? No?\n\n13\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.342\nOkay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:38.342 --> 00:00:40.208\n>> Very sensitive about that because as\n\n15\n00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.150\nyou see, I'm shrinking as we go.\n\n16\n00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.010\nSo any was I'll stop digressing.\n\n17\n00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.620\nWe'll get back to this here.\n\n18\n00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.390\nI'm just being silly for no good reason.\n\n19\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.220\nAnd it's only Tuesday.\n\n20\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.430\nImagine what will happen\nat the end of the week.\n\n21\n00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.870\nSo we've been talking about data security.\n\n22\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.470\nWe've been talking had a great\nconversation in our last episode with\n\n23\n00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.720\nregards to encryption\nthe importance of it.\n\n24\n00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.910\nHow we apply it to the IAS.\n\n25\n00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.550\nService model in particular.\n\n26\n00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.890\nHow we deal with it at the data layer.\n\n27\n00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.020\nWhat we do with it, different ways\nin which we can implement it, and\n\n28\n00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.520\nthe concerns we have from\na key management perspective.\n\n29\n00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.330\nA CCSP is with regards to the focal\npoint for risk management, for\n\n30\n00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.640\nguards to encryption how we have to\nmake sure we're focused on safeguarding\n\n31\n00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.560\nthe encryption mechanism by safeguarding\nthe keys and separating it from the data.\n\n32\n00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.810\nSo we've talked through all of that.\n\n33\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.840\nWhat and what we want to do now is spend\na little bit more time broadening our\n\n34\n00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.550\ndiscussion widening it out a little bit\nand incorporating other techniques other\n\n35\n00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.570\nareas other approaches that may be\nequally important beyond encryption.\n\n36\n00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.510\nEncryption is good and we often say\nencrypt first, encrypt last, and make sure\n\n37\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.600\nyou encrypt throughout the entire data\nlifecycle it's very, very important but\n\n38\n00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.380\nit may not be the only protection we want\nto include in our tool chest of tools or\n\n39\n00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.400\nour tool chest of approach mechanisms for\nrisk management.\n\n40\n00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.190\nWe want to do more.\n\n41\n00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.940\nIf you remember the concept of defense\nin depth, we often talk about mutually\n\n42\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.900\nreinforcing overlapping layers of controls\nso that if one control were to fail,\n\n43\n00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.510\nif one control were to be compromised,\nsomebody did get the keys for some reason,\n\n44\n00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.450\nwe didn't do a good job of\nseparating them from the data,\n\n45\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.570\nwe didn't do a good job\nof keeping them secure.\n\n46\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.680\nWhatever may have happened, we have to\nhave other control mechanisms in place\n\n47\n00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.150\nto make sure that even though\nthe data may be unencrypted.\n\n48\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.180\nThat it will still not\nnecessarily be accessible.\n\n49\n00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.660\nSo I wanna talk about masking,\nobfuscation and automization and\n\n50\n00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.520\nother techniques including tokenization,\nwhich we're gonna see a nice graphic on\n\n51\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.980\nhere in just a minute and then talk\nabout it in depth that helps us to\n\n52\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.840\nadd additional layers, additional control\nelements and additional protections.\n\n53\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.500\nSo when we think about data masking A lot\nof different approaches we may use here.\n\n54\n00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.450\nShuffling, deletion,\nalgorithmic substitution or\n\n55\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.630\nrandomly substituting data bits would\nall be examples of data masking.\n\n56\n00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.410\nWe're trying to hide the data by\nmanipulating it in some way to\n\n57\n00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.000\nmake it nonobvious, right?\n\n58\n00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.200\nSo for instance, when you look at a list\nof account numbers or a list of account\n\n59\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.500\nnames, and then maybe correspond them in\na look up table with account numbers.\n\n60\n00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.110\nWhat we want to do, is we would\nprobably want to delete everything but\n\n61\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.560\nthe last four reference numbers for\nthe account number, so\n\n62\n00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.390\nthat you can see them, but\nyou only see the last four.\n\n63\n00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.785\nAnd we have an end look-up table\nsomewhere that essentially links the two,\n\n64\n00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:17.925\ngiving you the full account\nnumber as you look it up.\n\n65\n00:03:17.925 --> 00:03:20.535\nBut only if you're authorized\nto run the query and see it.\n\n66\n00:03:20.535 --> 00:03:22.565\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe're masking the data.\n\n67\n00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:26.485\nBecause although the last four numbers\ntypically are used to identify many things\n\n68\n00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:29.380\nand may be important, they're not as\nvaluable as the entire account number\n\n69\n00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.050\nstring, and so we want to think about\ndifferent ways we can protect data but\n\n70\n00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.490\nstill make it useable, and one of\nthe ways to do that is through masking.\n\n71\n00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.320\nPrimary methods of masking data\nmay be either static or dynamic,\n\n72\n00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.520\nwe can do this, you know, in a fixed\nway like I was just talking about.\n\n73\n00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.500\nWe may do it dynamically,\nwhere the data is pulled from data tables,\n\n74\n00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.290\nessentially put together through a query,\npresented in some sort of web form or\n\n75\n00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.360\nwhatever it may be to a user.\n\n76\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.065\nSo think about yourself calling up to\na help task for your credit card company,\n\n77\n00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:01.145\nyour bank whatever utility may deal with\nand you're talking to somebody in a data\n\n78\n00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:04.525\ncenter somewhere in a call center rather\nand they've got your account information\n\n79\n00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:07.910\non the screen, that information’s\nbeing displayed for them.\n\n80\n00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.870\nOut of a database,\nwith millions of records.\n\n81\n00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.920\nYou and everybody else, that's a customer\nof the company, is in that system.\n\n82\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.560\nBut that, particular operator's really\nonly seeing you at that moment in time.\n\n83\n00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.710\nBecause they've run a search,\nrun a query, that's filtered, and\n\n84\n00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:22.510\nessentially built the record for you.\n\n85\n00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.140\nThat's usually going to be\nstatically stored data but\n\n86\n00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.380\ndynamically attributed to the user that is\nusing the data to process your request.\n\n87\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.530\nSo, their seeing it on\nthe screen in real time and\n\n88\n00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.780\ndepending on the information you provide,\nthe data may be updated.\n\n89\n00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.730\nSo, we can do this in\na variety of different ways.\n\n90\n00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.700\nI just want to think\nabout the large of that.\n\n91\n00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.610\nYou often wander I don't know if you have\nany experience with this or you know,\n\n92\n00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.065\nwhen you're in your tie right?\n\n93\n00:04:45.065 --> 00:04:47.540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> When you worked at the insurance entity\n\n94\n00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.740\nif you had to deal with\nthis end of the operation?\n\n95\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.920\nBut I always am amazed\nby the way things work.\n\n96\n00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.160\nI mean it's just how I am,\nI'm kinda wired that way.\n\n97\n00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.110\nI'm always examining, always thinking in\nmy mind, hey what would I do to make that\n\n98\n00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.140\nprocess better if it was me on the far\nend of that phone managing that?\n\n99\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.560\nAnd when you call into\none of these systems.\n\n100\n00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.550\nAnd the automated phone system, because\nyou never get a human being right away,\n\n101\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.880\nwill, it will ask you for your data so\nit prompts you, right, who are you,\n\n102\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.330\nput in your customer ID, put in your\nSSN or whatever it may be, and then as\n\n103\n00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.240\na result we find you, great, Mr. Gordon,\nwe found out who you are, wonderful,\n\n104\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.460\nand we have all this information,\nwe can tell you about yourself, and\n\n105\n00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.455\nabout everything you own, and you know,\nanything you've ever done, right?\n\n106\n00:05:23.455 --> 00:05:26.680\n>> [LAUGH] You know, Skynet is all\npervasive, all knowing, all seeing.\n\n107\n00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.260\nAnd then when we want to hand you to\na human being we're essentially gonna hit\n\n108\n00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.920\nthe reset button and ask you to provide\nall that information again because for\n\n109\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.350\nsome unknown reason, right,\n\n110\n00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.920\nthe master architects involved in this\ndata system were not smart enough\n\n111\n00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.500\nto figure out how to take that data\nthat is sitting in their system and\n\n112\n00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.380\nport it to the live operator Instead of\nletting the computer access it directly.\n\n113\n00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.820\nNow I know it's not that simple, and I\nknow that they actually do import the data\n\n114\n00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.680\nand I know, for the most part,\nit does show up.\n\n115\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.010\nAnd a lot of times they're just validating\nwho you are by asking you to repeat it,\n\n116\n00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.740\nrepetitively go through it so\nthat they can make sure,\n\n117\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.140\nfrom a security standpoint, they're really\ntalking to you and not somebody who just\n\n118\n00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.920\nshoved you off the phone and\nis pretending to be you, so I get that and\n\n119\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.780\nI understand why but in some cases,\nwhen you ask them, the data's not there.\n\n120\n00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.990\nThey actually have to reproduce it by\nhaving you put that information into\n\n121\n00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.740\nthe system and pull it back up.\n\n122\n00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.620\nAnd it wouldn't be hard for\nthe data to be displayed and ported over.\n\n123\n00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.540\nBut one of the reasons we don't do that is\nfrom this perspective we're talking about,\n\n124\n00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.850\nfrom an obfuscation, anonymization,\nand masking perspective.\n\n125\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.930\nThey don't want individual systems to be\nable to cross pollinate data, because\n\n126\n00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.070\nthey're worried about the integrity and\nthe confidentiality of that data.\n\n127\n00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.940\nThis is actually done on purpose.\n\n128\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.320\nI rail against it all the time and\nit just bothers me to no end,\n\n129\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.900\nbecause I understand how you\ncould do it securely, and\n\n130\n00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.350\nI know it can be done, and\nthere are companies that do it.\n\n131\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.060\nBut then there are those that don't,\nso it's very random.\n\n132\n00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.090\nSo it just bugs me to no end when\nI have to go through that again.\n\n133\n00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.060\n>> It's never a good time when you call\nup your cable company, or whatever.\n\n134\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.440\nYou've gone through the fifty-five\nmillion automated systems,\n\n135\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.000\njust to get to the human\nat the other end and\n\n136\n00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.530\nthey go, can you please verify your date\nof birth and your social security number?\n\n137\n00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.470\nAnd your last name is?\n\n138\n00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.040\nAnd where do I live?\n\n139\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.080\nAnd you're like I did this already!\n\n140\n00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.990\nAnd, like you're saying, there are ways\nin which we can make that happen, but we\n\n141\n00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.380\ndo it for security reasons and typically,\nand correct me if I'm wrong, the more\n\n142\n00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.420\nfrustrating it is, the probably the more\nsecure it is, to be honest with you.\n\n143\n00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.810\n>> Well, you would think but\nnot necessarily, right?\n\n144\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.110\nFrustrating it is rule of them\nit's just more frustrating.\n\n145\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.750\n>> This is more frustrating.\n\n146\n00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.680\n>> It's just typically how it is.\n\n147\n00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.950\n>> But the complexities, right?\n\n148\n00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:26.850\nThe more complex should I\nguess that I should say.\n\n149\n00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.360\n>> Well hopefully, I mean you know\nagain it's like anything else.\n\n150\n00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.110\nYou would like to assume that there\nis a rhyme and a reason ultimately a,\n\n151\n00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.970\nyou know a master hand, right?\n\n152\n00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.540\nAt work behind the scenes.\n\n153\n00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.590\nAnd some times there is and\nI want to be fair as I try to always do.\n\n154\n00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.280\nWe talk about these things, give proper\namount of due to systems, companies and\n\n155\n00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.840\nentities that do it the right way.\n\n156\n00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.990\nThere are many companies that do and have\na really good handle on data management.\n\n157\n00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.949\nThere are many that don't.\n\n158\n00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:54.365\nAnd so we just make it overly on\nneedlessly complex for no good reason and\n\n159\n00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:59.224\nas a result of that complicate their own\nlives and ultimately the lives of their\n\n160\n00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:04.081\ncustomers, and while you may think that\nit's more secure when you come to find\n\n161\n00:08:04.081 --> 00:08:08.790\nout later that perhaps it's not because\nthere's been a breach, you know,\n\n162\n00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.080\nit just sheds light on all\nsorts of other issues.\n\n163\n00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.230\nAnd so yeah, it's customers will\nkind of held hostage, right?\n\n164\n00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.890\nUltimately we don't really\nhave a lot of choice.\n\n165\n00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.490\nYou know if you're doing\nbusiness with a business and\n\n166\n00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:22.030\nthey have your information and\nthey choose to store it a certain way, you\n\n167\n00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.010\ncan always opt out in theory and take your\nbusiness elsewhere, don't get me wrong.\n\n168\n00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.810\nThere's many credit card companies in\nthe world, you don't have to do business\n\n169\n00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.050\nwith the ones don't treat you the right\nway, but you know there's a lot of other\n\n170\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.030\nthings that going on that conversation for\na customer.\n\n171\n00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:35.690\nAnd data security may or\nmay not be at the top of that list for\n\n172\n00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.920\nmany of us Quality of life and ease of\nuse may or may not be, we see more and\n\n173\n00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.460\nmore automation, less and less humanity\nin the system and it's getting harder and\n\n174\n00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.970\nharder to deal with people to get your\nquestions answered, and that in and\n\n175\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.950\nof itself can be problematic and\nfrustrating,\n\n176\n00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.130\nbut it's not always an indication\nof good or bad security.\n\n177\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.220\nIt's simply and indication of cost\ncutting, more often than not,\n\n178\n00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.180\nlike anything else.\n\n179\n00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.240\nSo data anonymization is also\nimportant for us to consider I\n\n180\n00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.110\ntalked about the fact that we can mask\nthose fields in the account number,\n\n181\n00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.350\nfor instance, right, to make sure that\nthey're not seeing things like that.\n\n182\n00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:11.040\nWe may remove indirect identifiers.\n\n183\n00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.690\nWe may not add your actual An actual\nname associated with the account number,\n\n184\n00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:17.190\nin the same fields or\nin the same database.\n\n185\n00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.970\nWhen they store them differently or\nassign a random identifier number,\n\n186\n00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:24.540\nthat cross references another table\nto link you to your account numbers.\n\n187\n00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.625\nDifferent ways to do that But the idea is\nthat we want to really separate the data\n\n188\n00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:31.105\nand separate the ability to aggregate and\ninfer from the data.\n\n189\n00:09:31.105 --> 00:09:32.255\nAnd if we can do that,\n\n190\n00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:35.445\nwe then are in some way adding\nadditional layers of protection.\n\n191\n00:09:35.445 --> 00:09:38.535\nTokenization is also something\nthat we often focus on and\n\n192\n00:09:38.535 --> 00:09:43.980\nis indeed from a CCSP's perspective\nwith regards to not only the thought\n\n193\n00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.760\nprocess to actually implement systems,\nbut specifically to prepare for the exam.\n\n194\n00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.310\nSomething that is important and\nyou want to understand.\n\n195\n00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.820\nSubstituting sensitive data elements\nwith essentially non-sensitive\n\n196\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.690\nequivalents that are setup in such a way\nto refer to the sensitive data but\n\n197\n00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.330\nindirectly and\nare used to essentially token the data.\n\n198\n00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.400\nTokenization is the process of swapping\nthis out, is what we often do.\n\n199\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.320\nWe do this to comply with regulations or\nlaws, to reduce the cost of compliance.\n\n200\n00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.260\nIt's usually cheaper to do this\nthan maybe do other things.\n\n201\n00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.430\nAnd to mitigate the risks of storing data,\n\n202\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.440\nsensitive data in particular in\nsystems that may be compromised.\n\n203\n00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.410\nI know we have a graphic that you\nhave worked long and hard on, sir.\n\n204\n00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.690\nIf we could take a look at\nthat right up there and\n\n205\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.790\nwe'll take a look at\nhow tokenization works.\n\n206\n00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.620\nNow we do have numbers on this graphic.\n\n207\n00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.270\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nthis graphic overall but\n\n208\n00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.230\nwe're gonna talk about the steps involved.\n\n209\n00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.950\nIn the process of tokenization.\n\n210\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.060\nBecause what we're ultimately gonna\ndo is walk through these steps.\n\n211\n00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.330\nCan we blow that up a little bit?\n\n212\n00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.070\nCan we, I just wanna move me out\nof the box and do full screen or\n\n213\n00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.640\nif you can move that in a little bit,\nwhatever makes more sense.\n\n214\n00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.220\nBut we just wanna make sure everybody\ncan see that and I'm being selfish,\n\n215\n00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.480\nI wanna be able to see it well too,\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n216\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.470\nThat's actually a little bit better.\n\n217\n00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.420\nSo that's gonna be helpful.\n\n218\n00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.040\nI just wanna make sure we\nactually can see all the steps.\n\n219\n00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.230\nSo when we're thinking about\ntokenizations, what we're thinking about\n\n220\n00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.880\nessentially Is remember,\ntrying to remove the sensitive data and\n\n221\n00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.390\noffering a non-sensitive equivalent\nthat can be referred to back and\n\n222\n00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:07.320\nforth in some sort of secure\nprocess off to the side.\n\n223\n00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.890\nAnd then making sure that we have\naccess to that process to equate\n\n224\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.190\nthe non-sensitive with the sensitive\ndata or the non-sensitive identifier.\n\n225\n00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.630\nWhat we call the token.\n\n226\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.339\nSo what we have is we have\nthe ability to be able to go through.\n\n227\n00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.710\nAnd to be able to walk\nthrough the steps involved.\n\n228\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.440\nBut let's lay out the moving parts here.\n\n229\n00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.380\nWe have database in the lower right-hand\ncorner kind of in an aqua blue\n\n230\n00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.610\nkind of color, right, labeled as database.\n\n231\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.770\nWe have an application server in yellow\nmoving across the horizon there.\n\n232\n00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.430\nOn the left,\nwe have a tokenization server,\n\n233\n00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.240\nkind of diagonally up into the middle.\n\n234\n00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.730\nWe have an authorized application that's\naccessing data off to the right in green.\n\n235\n00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:48.300\nAnd then up at the upper left we have\na secondary database, a token database.\n\n236\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.890\nSpecifically where\nthe tokens will be stored.\n\n237\n00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.820\nAnd so the application that is\nbeing used is gonna collect or\n\n238\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:55.730\ngenerate a piece of sensitive data.\n\n239\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.600\nSo we're gonna start by generating data.\n\n240\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.720\nCuz remember we have to\ncreate data somewhere,\n\n241\n00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.620\nwe typically do that in an application.\n\n242\n00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.300\nData is then sent over to\nthe tokenization server.\n\n243\n00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.790\nIt is not stored locally.\n\n244\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.575\nSo you'll see, in,\nin step two down on the lower left\n\n245\n00:12:09.575 --> 00:12:13.635\nwe're going to have the application\nserver and the application server is\n\n246\n00:12:13.635 --> 00:12:17.745\ntypically where data is typically going\nto be stored when it is created and\n\n247\n00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:21.540\nwe want to move that out because we\ndon't want to keep it there locally.\n\n248\n00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.830\nWe want to swap that data for\na non-sensitive equivalent or\n\n249\n00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.180\na token and we've got to move the data\nout of the application server\n\n250\n00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.110\nup into the tokenization server\nin order to be able to do that.\n\n251\n00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.220\nSo, we're going to create\nthe data somewhere.\n\n252\n00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.820\nWe didn't really label step one, but\nyou can have an authorized application.\n\n253\n00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:39.550\nThat's accessing data on\nthe backend in step six.\n\n254\n00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.590\nBut we most likely have an authorized\napp that also is creating data.\n\n255\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:45.140\nSo you essentially could\nsee an arrow coming down\n\n256\n00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.640\nout of that app into the application\nserver that would be more or\n\n257\n00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.020\nless step one,\neven though we didn't bother to put it on.\n\n258\n00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.650\nThe diagram, but\nwe would imply that that's happening.\n\n259\n00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.150\nSo the data shows up at the app server.\n\n260\n00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.410\nWe then move the data with\nthe pink arrow up in step two\n\n261\n00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.090\ninto the tokenization server.\n\n262\n00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.090\nWe don't store the data locally,\nin other words.\n\n263\n00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.670\nWe're gonna move it off In\nthe tokenization server in step three,\n\n264\n00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.170\nwe generate the token and\n\n265\n00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.020\nyou'll see that the sensitive data\nin the token are then moved and\n\n266\n00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.400\nstored not in the tokenization server, but\nrather up in the token database, right?\n\n267\n00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.705\nSo step three loops up Up to the,\n\n268\n00:13:18.705 --> 00:13:20.915\nI do this all the time whenever\nI'm presenting for you guys.\n\n269\n00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:23.825\nI go one way and it's the exact\nopposite of the way that I want\n\n270\n00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:26.045\nto represent on show and\nof course, I'm off screen.\n\n271\n00:13:26.045 --> 00:13:27.115\nI hate the box-in-box thing.\n\n272\n00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:28.205\nIt just does not work for me.\n\n273\n00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:29.295\nI'm directionally challenged.\n\n274\n00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:33.385\nSo, we're moving op to the left and you'll\nsee as we go up in step 3, we're moving up\n\n275\n00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:37.775\nfrom the Tokenization Server into the\nToken Database where the sensitive data,\n\n276\n00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:41.075\nas well as the token itself can be\nstored or is stored, I should say.\n\n277\n00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.360\nIn step four as we come back\ndown to the application.\n\n278\n00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.440\nOr excuse me through the token\ndatabase to the server.\n\n279\n00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.740\nAnd then ultimately down\nto the application server.\n\n280\n00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.490\nYou'll see the token server returns\nthe token to the application.\n\n281\n00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:56.350\nSo we're moving the token back down.\n\n282\n00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.300\nAnd the token,\nbeing separated from the database.\n\n283\n00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.380\nOr excuse me, separated from\nthe sensitive data, stored up there,\n\n284\n00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.890\ncan now be stored and referenced,\n\n285\n00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.640\nand we can use the two parts of the puzzle\nto essentially reproduce the data.\n\n286\n00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.000\nThe application stores the token, rather\nthan the original data in step five.\n\n287\n00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.400\nAnd so the application server you'll see,\nis moving with the white arrow over\n\n288\n00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:20.280\nto the database and then back from the\ndatabase back to the application server.\n\n289\n00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.440\nThe token that it has received from\nthe token server via the token database.\n\n290\n00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.195\nThat's, that's where the token is stored.\n\n291\n00:14:26.195 --> 00:14:27.925\nIt's stored in the application server.\n\n292\n00:14:27.925 --> 00:14:31.175\nSo we're not storing the sensitive\ndata locally in the application and\n\n293\n00:14:31.175 --> 00:14:33.695\nthe application server,\nwe're actually storing the token\n\n294\n00:14:33.695 --> 00:14:37.472\nwhich represents the data that is now\nsecurely stored in the token database.\n\n295\n00:14:37.472 --> 00:14:39.702\nSo, we've essentially proxied the data and\n\n296\n00:14:39.702 --> 00:14:41.802\nrepresented it with\nsomething as a placeholder.\n\n297\n00:14:41.802 --> 00:14:45.972\nAnd then, in step six, once sensitive data\nis needed from an authorized application,\n\n298\n00:14:45.972 --> 00:14:49.912\nthe authorized application will request\nthat the data be made available,\n\n299\n00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:52.232\nuser can do that through\nthe application or\n\n300\n00:14:52.232 --> 00:14:54.392\nthe application could proxy\non behalf of the user.\n\n301\n00:14:54.392 --> 00:14:56.642\nThe service can be used,\nwhatever it may be but\n\n302\n00:14:56.642 --> 00:15:00.080\nsomething that's authorized will\nshow up and request the data.\n\n303\n00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:04.010\nSo it's ultimately going to talk to\nthe tokenization server, request the data,\n\n304\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.860\nit's going to have to then present\nthe information or the credential\n\n305\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.060\nthat's going to identify it as being\nauthorized, we then could do a lookup and\n\n306\n00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.740\nessentially retrieve the data,\nbring it back down, and make it available.\n\n307\n00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.260\nSo this is the process of tokenization.\n\n308\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.840\nWe want to make sure we\nunderstand the thought process,\n\n309\n00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.330\nwe want to understand that sensitive\ndata in pink is being stored.\n\n310\n00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:28.782\nAnd is going to be moved up and down\nthe system and then the un-sensitive or\n\n311\n00:15:28.782 --> 00:15:32.700\nnon-sensitive tokenized equivalent in\nwhite is being transferred back and\n\n312\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.160\nforth and stored and\nis being requested and used as well.\n\n313\n00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.000\nAnd as we send the Token in step six,\nyou will see from the authorized app.\n\n314\n00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.211\nWe are getting in paint mode\non the top there right.\n\n315\n00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:46.867\nThe actual encrypted or sensitive data\nthat comes back down ultimately from\n\n316\n00:15:46.867 --> 00:15:50.950\nthe token data base by server,\nso we can consume the data.\n\n317\n00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:55.345\nSo the tokenization architecture is very\nimportant for us as a cloud security\n\n318\n00:15:55.345 --> 00:16:00.208\nprofessional, we wanna make sure we\nunderstand the concepts of tokenization.\n\n319\n00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:03.870\nWe also wanna make sure we understand\nhow these systems are operating so\n\n320\n00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.660\nwe understand how to offer\nprotection using this particular\n\n321\n00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.830\nchoice if we indeed choose to go\nthrough a tokenization solution.\n\n322\n00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.880\nNow when we think about tokenization,\n\n323\n00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.540\nwe obviously have a lot of\nmoving parts here, right?\n\n324\n00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.840\nWe've got the database and\nthe application server on the bottom\n\n325\n00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.670\nthat's storing non-sensitive tokens,\nright?\n\n326\n00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:23.570\nWe're generating originally\nsensitive data in that area and\n\n327\n00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.530\nthen very quickly moving it out.\n\n328\n00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.180\nWe have secure network communications and\npathways that have to be accounted for.\n\n329\n00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.060\nWe have a tokenization server and\n\n330\n00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.675\na tokenization database up on the top that\nalso have to be maintained and store data\n\n331\n00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:40.350\nsecurely and generate secure equivalents\nof the data via the token process.\n\n332\n00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:44.230\nWe have authorized applications that are\ngonna be used and have to be essentially\n\n333\n00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:49.330\nset up and maintained to allow\naccess to swap a token, an unsecured\n\n334\n00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.189\nnon representative version of the secure\ndata, or excuse me a non secured\n\n335\n00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.620\nrepresentative version of the data to then\nget the equivalent the actual data itself.\n\n336\n00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.980\nAnd so we wanna make sure that we\nreally are asking questions here.\n\n337\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:07.620\nAs customers, as CCSPs, this is gonna\nbe a solution we get from a provider,\n\n338\n00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.060\nthis is not something we build ourselves,\ntraditionally.\n\n339\n00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.760\nCloud providers will offer\ntokenization services,\n\n340\n00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.610\nthere are Cloud service providers\nthat will offer this as a service.\n\n341\n00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:20.940\nYou can consume tokenization as a service\nas part of managed security systems so\n\n342\n00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.910\nyou can buy this particular\nfeature of this function.\n\n343\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.330\nYou may get an application\nprovider that does this and\n\n344\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.350\nassociates this with all your data.\n\n345\n00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.100\nSo you have to go out and\nfind a vendor in other words.\n\n346\n00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.490\nAnd get a solution that\nmatches your expectations.\n\n347\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.750\nAnd that can sometimes can be difficult,\nright?\n\n348\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.892\nYou have to maybe go\nthrough an RFP process.\n\n349\n00:17:37.892 --> 00:17:41.520\nYou may have to go through an RFQ and\nan RFI as a result of that request for\n\n350\n00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.020\nquestions to go out to the vendor and\nhave them submit.\n\n351\n00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.190\nOr let you submit questions around that.\n\n352\n00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.750\nRequests for information.\n\n353\n00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.820\nRequests for the overall,\nessentially a quote, and\n\n354\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.210\na process to go through to basically get\na contract in place can be extensive.\n\n355\n00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.150\nAnd we have to probably do some testing,\nso we may have to set up one or\n\n356\n00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.090\nmore environments and\n\n357\n00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:04.320\nrun through multiple demos from different\nvendors before we find the right fit.\n\n358\n00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.840\nSo this can be a bit of an issue, right?\n\n359\n00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.400\nAnd we have to really pay attention to the\nprocess of authenticating the application\n\n360\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.450\nwhen storing or retrieving sensitive data.\n\n361\n00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.160\nSo that block right there\nbetween the authorized app and\n\n362\n00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.980\nthe tokenization server,\nwhich is step 6 essentially, right?\n\n363\n00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.700\nWe have to make sure that\nwe're really focusing on that.\n\n364\n00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.890\nBecause if that is not well protected,\nthen all the other stuff we\n\n365\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.490\ndo that's really good, can break down\nbecause somebody could come in and\n\n366\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:32.200\nspoof the identity of the authorized app,\nand essentially request\n\n367\n00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.180\nsensitive data without having the rights\nor without having the right token in\n\n368\n00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:38.270\norder to be able to see it, and\nthat would compromise the entire system.\n\n369\n00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:41.260\nSo that's very, very problematic for\nus potentially.\n\n370\n00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.010\nAlso, does this system meet\nour compliance requirements?\n\n371\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.500\nWill this level of architecture give us\nthe governance and the risk management and\n\n372\n00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.690\nthe compliance capabilities\nwe need to be aligned,\n\n373\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:54.400\nessentially, and\nto be regulatorily compliant\n\n374\n00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:57.930\nwith whatever the system is that\nwe have to match up against.\n\n375\n00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.430\nWhatever our audits will prove or\n\n376\n00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:02.170\nnot prove with regards to that\nis going to be important.\n\n377\n00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.480\nSo is this compliant will be\nanother important question for\n\n378\n00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.840\nus the CCSPs to be asking about and\nthinking about.\n\n379\n00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:10.640\nVery, very important,\n\n380\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.110\na lot of moving parts here that we\nreally would have to consider as a CCSP.\n\n381\n00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:17.970\nSo there's a lot more depth to this design\nthan just what's on the page, is my point.\n\n382\n00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.880\nAnd when we implement these kind of\nsystems, we have to be very critical, and\n\n383\n00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.530\nhave to have an eye for detail.\n\n384\n00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:23.860\nAnd we have to really road test them.\n\n385\n00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.160\nA lot of times, I hate to hear\nthe customers have implemented technology,\n\n386\n00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.420\njust based on a 30 minute video\ndemonstration or tutorial.\n\n387\n00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.900\nAnd have not really test drove that\napplication in their environment, and\n\n388\n00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.570\nreally understood it, and\nseen it in operation.\n\n389\n00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.350\nIt's one thing to see it, it's another\nthing to see it in your world, and\n\n390\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.970\nreally see what it does or\ndoesn't do, as it scales.\n\n391\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:46.420\nAnd that's a very important component of\nwhat we as CCSPs need to think about and\n\n392\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.110\nbring to the table.\n\n393\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:51.360\nWe have to manage risk by understanding\nhow to apply the right technology solution\n\n394\n00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.000\nto the right compliance problem.\n\n395\n00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.310\nIt may be a great solution for\n\n396\n00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.110\nsome in other words, but it may not\nbe a great solution for everybody.\n\n397\n00:19:57.110 --> 00:20:01.010\nIt may not be a one size fits one\nas opposed to a one size fits all.\n\n398\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:04.521\nAnd we want a one size fits one solution\nwhen and wherever possible, because\n\n399\n00:20:04.521 --> 00:20:08.580\nremember the Cloud is about tailoring\nthe understanding of the platform and\n\n400\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.030\nthe capabilities of the platform\nto our business requirements.\n\n401\n00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.230\nNot about taking somebody else's needs and\n\n402\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:16.070\napplying them to our environment hoping\nthat they line up and make sense.\n\n403\n00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.910\nAt least it should be that,\nit should be a one size fits one,\n\n404\n00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.090\nnot a one size fits all.\n\n405\n00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.140\nSo you wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that if we can be.\n\n406\n00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:27.000\nWhen we talk about tokenization, we talk\nabout yet another way to safeguard and\n\n407\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:27.960\nsecure data.\n\n408\n00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.040\nWe've also talked about bit splitting and\nscattering our bits around, as I talked\n\n409\n00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.600\nabout in one of our prior episodes where\nwe'll set them up and stage them in\n\n410\n00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.310\ndifferent areas, and then bring them back\ntogether to form the data packets or\n\n411\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.910\nthe data that is necessary to engage\nin the activities we're asking about.\n\n412\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.120\nThis is, if you think about Windows\ntechnology cuz a lot of us are familiar\n\n413\n00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.090\nwith Windows, if you think about DFS,\nthe Distributed File System,\n\n414\n00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.400\nif you're familiar, the concepts of\nDFS having duplicative copies of\n\n415\n00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.010\ndata that's stored around in different\nfile shares or different systems.\n\n416\n00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:02.030\nSo that essentially if we lose access\nto one distributed synchronized copy,\n\n417\n00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.500\nwe probably have others that\nwe can serve up data from.\n\n418\n00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.570\nThat's more or\nless what bit splitting is about.\n\n419\n00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:07.880\nWe're gonna have multiple copies.\n\n420\n00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.230\nWe're not making them identical.\n\n421\n00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:11.840\nWe're typically splitting up\nthe data into different areas.\n\n422\n00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.420\nAnd as a result of that, it's harder for\n\n423\n00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.850\nthe bad actor to get a hold of all\nthe data necessary by breaking into one\n\n424\n00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.640\ncentral point in the system\nto gain access to everything.\n\n425\n00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.420\nCuz they have to break into\nmultiple areas to get all the data.\n\n426\n00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.000\nAnd because of this it improves our data\nsecurity specifically with regards to\n\n427\n00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.160\nconfidentiality.\n\n428\n00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.730\nWe can scale because we can\nincorporate Cloud storage APIs and\n\n429\n00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.730\nthe technology that vendors\nprovide to split the data and\n\n430\n00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:36.390\nlet the Cloud provider manage\nthat on the back-end securely.\n\n431\n00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.730\nThrough multi pathing, through network\narchitecture that is redundant and\n\n432\n00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.280\noverlapping through mesh or\nwhatever it may be.\n\n433\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.840\nSo they can provide that capability,\nwe just need the API and the front-end\n\n434\n00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.485\nthat they give us essentially to\nconsume and then let the Cloud\n\n435\n00:21:49.485 --> 00:21:53.105\nprovider manage everything else, let them\ndeal in other words with the complexity.\n\n436\n00:21:53.105 --> 00:21:55.275\nWe just want them to know that\nwe can split our data up, and\n\n437\n00:21:55.275 --> 00:21:57.985\nit's going to be stored\nsafely in five places.\n\n438\n00:21:57.985 --> 00:22:00.595\nAnd when we want it, we can essentially\nbring it all back together and\n\n439\n00:22:00.595 --> 00:22:02.217\noperate on it as if it\nwas in one location.\n\n440\n00:22:02.217 --> 00:22:05.737\n>> Yeah, it sounds a lot like RAID\nstriping almost where you're taking just\n\n441\n00:22:05.737 --> 00:22:08.306\nbits of the data,\nput it on one disk and then [CROSSTALK]\n\n442\n00:22:08.306 --> 00:22:09.741\n>> RAID striping with parity,\n\n443\n00:22:09.741 --> 00:22:13.685\nit would be like RAID striping with parity\nin the sense that it is recoverable,\n\n444\n00:22:13.685 --> 00:22:16.993\nat least in most cases we have\na recoverability capability.\n\n445\n00:22:16.993 --> 00:22:17.993\nIt's not always that way.\n\n446\n00:22:17.993 --> 00:22:20.593\nIt does depend on technology and\nimplementation.\n\n447\n00:22:20.593 --> 00:22:23.953\nBut because we can bit split\nacross geographies in theory,\n\n448\n00:22:23.953 --> 00:22:25.713\nif we use the scale of a hosting model.\n\n449\n00:22:25.713 --> 00:22:29.791\nSo remember the map we showed you\nwith Microsoft's Data Center hosting\n\n450\n00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:30.411\ntopology, right?\n\n451\n00:22:30.411 --> 00:22:33.481\nSo they've got data centers in\n20 locations around the world,\n\n452\n00:22:33.481 --> 00:22:34.241\nwherever it may be.\n\n453\n00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:37.881\nThe idea would be if we split that among\nthem, it would be almost impossible for\n\n454\n00:22:37.881 --> 00:22:41.340\na bad actor to get into all of\nthose systems and probably effect\n\n455\n00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.220\na hack that would bring all that\ndata together in one place easily.\n\n456\n00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.362\nSo it could very well operate that way.\n\n457\n00:22:46.362 --> 00:22:49.470\nAnd it would also safeguard\nus from potentially, and\n\n458\n00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.580\nI'm not saying that this is appropriate,\nlet me just be clear.\n\n459\n00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.845\nBig asterisk here, big disclaimer, right?\n\n460\n00:22:55.845 --> 00:22:57.125\nI'm not suggesting for\n\n461\n00:22:57.125 --> 00:23:00.555\na minute that bad actors should\ntake advantage of this approach.\n\n462\n00:23:00.555 --> 00:23:03.825\nI'm not suggesting when I say this\nthat we should be up to illegal or\n\n463\n00:23:03.825 --> 00:23:07.425\nillicit activities and as a result use\nbit splitting to hide those activities.\n\n464\n00:23:07.425 --> 00:23:10.595\nBut I am about to point something out with\nregards to legal jurisdiction and bit\n\n465\n00:23:10.595 --> 00:23:14.385\nsplitting, because elements of the data\nare scattered in multiple geographies and\n\n466\n00:23:14.385 --> 00:23:17.290\nprobably as a result\nmultiple jurisdictions.\n\n467\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.040\nIt is harder for\na single company to be sued and\n\n468\n00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.860\nto be served with a discovery orders for\ndata.\n\n469\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.030\nThat may require bringing that data\nin from multiple jurisdictions.\n\n470\n00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.710\nBecause a court may not have rights to\nclaim all that data across multiple\n\n471\n00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.670\njurisdictions.\n\n472\n00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:35.350\nSo it opens up some very interesting\nlegal questions for us as well.\n\n473\n00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:36.720\nBoth pro and con, right,?\n\n474\n00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.810\nBecause there may be value in doing that.\n\n475\n00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.200\nAnd you may push the boundary and\ntest the envelope of the interpretation of\n\n476\n00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.290\nthe legality,\nof geographically displaced data.\n\n477\n00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.881\nAnd geo hosting that data\nthrough bit splitting,\n\n478\n00:23:47.881 --> 00:23:50.479\nmay prove to be a challenge\nin legal proceedings.\n\n479\n00:23:50.479 --> 00:23:54.871\nBecause the court may not have\njurisdiction or capabilities cross border,\n\n480\n00:23:54.871 --> 00:23:59.054\ncross national Boundary to be able to\npull data in through a discovery and\n\n481\n00:23:59.054 --> 00:24:00.030\nlegal process.\n\n482\n00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.102\nOr there may be extra territorial\nrequirements that that\n\n483\n00:24:03.102 --> 00:24:05.918\ncourt will have to go through,\nthrough treaties and\n\n484\n00:24:05.918 --> 00:24:09.250\nobligations of partner nations\nto bring that data together.\n\n485\n00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:12.000\nAnd there are ways in which\nthat can be done today.\n\n486\n00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.550\nIn the world we live in where there is\ncooperation among countries due to,\n\n487\n00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.650\nunfortunately, just the issues we\nsee politically, socially, and\n\n488\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.960\neconomically today in the world that are\nfermenting all sorts of activities that we\n\n489\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.460\nconstantly are on watch and on guard for.\n\n490\n00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.870\nThere may be treaties, and there may be\nextra territorial negotiations that take\n\n491\n00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.630\nplace to pull that data in under\nthe guise of national security,\n\n492\n00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.040\nwhen indeed normally you may\nnot get access to that data.\n\n493\n00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.460\nSo there are mitigating\ncircumstance on both sides.\n\n494\n00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.756\nI don't wanna get into\nthe black hole concept and\n\n495\n00:24:42.756 --> 00:24:46.284\ndebate here that we can go down very\nquickly with regards to this rabbit hole\n\n496\n00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:49.940\nabout whether it’s gonna be a good or\na bad idea and what the outcome would be.\n\n497\n00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:53.268\nI'm just pointing out to you that there\nare a lot of challenges on the surface\n\n498\n00:24:53.268 --> 00:24:56.236\nthat we don't always see and\nthink about with these technologies.\n\n499\n00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:59.932\nThat can be both beneficial and\npotentially a liability for us as security\n\n500\n00:24:59.932 --> 00:25:04.047\nprofessionals as we think about how these\ntechnologies may be implemented beyond\n\n501\n00:25:04.047 --> 00:25:08.600\njust the technicality of implementing\nthem, the actual technical architecture.\n\n502\n00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.570\nIt's the legal usage ramifications and\noverlay and the governance and\n\n503\n00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.020\ncompliance that we often overlook.\n\n504\n00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:17.970\nAnd that become then the subject\nof debate and in some cases,\n\n505\n00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.260\nyears of legal wrangling after the fact.\n\n506\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.140\nAnd the problem there is that\nthe data may be frozen in time.\n\n507\n00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.880\nOne court may claim the data,\nother courts may or\n\n508\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.720\nmay not choose to recognize that claim.\n\n509\n00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:30.300\nBut the company may be barred\nfrom moving the data or\n\n510\n00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.360\nusing it in any way until the claims are\nresolved, in which case you may actually\n\n511\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.350\nhave data that sits essentially frozen\nin limbo in time on multiple systems.\n\n512\n00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.777\nAnd that can prove to be a liability\nas well because technology and\n\n513\n00:25:41.777 --> 00:25:45.031\nthe protections offered by it\ncan bypass that data over time.\n\n514\n00:25:45.031 --> 00:25:48.601\nAnd that data may become compromised\nsimply because technology is no longer\n\n515\n00:25:48.601 --> 00:25:49.612\nable to keep it safe.\n\n516\n00:25:49.612 --> 00:25:52.732\nAnd we're not able to touch it to\nessentially update the protections because\n\n517\n00:25:52.732 --> 00:25:55.910\nwe're under legal constraint and\nwe're not able to do so.\n\n518\n00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.030\nSo there are many, many issues and\n\n519\n00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.560\nconcerns here that just go out well\nbeyond, I'm gonna encrypt my data.\n\n520\n00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.340\nNo, I'm gonna sprinkle it around, and\nI'll lay a bunch of it over here and\n\n521\n00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.070\nsome over there and when I want it\nI'll pull it all back together.\n\n522\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.760\nIt sounds really cool, and\nindeed, it is really cool.\n\n523\n00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.610\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n524\n00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:15.140\nBut there are a lot of concerns\nthat as a security professional\n\n525\n00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.290\nwe would have to really wade through and\nultimately try to understand.\n\n526\n00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:22.060\nAnd by the way, some of these concerns are\nnot well-documented, not because we don't\n\n527\n00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.440\nunderstand them, but because there just is\nno legal recourse here that's been tried\n\n528\n00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.200\nand is authoritatively agreed to as\nprecedent by everybody involved.\n\n529\n00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.560\nSome of this is uncharted territory,\nin other words, right?\n\n530\n00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.240\nAnd because of that you may look for\nguidance and say, well,\n\n531\n00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.850\nif I do it this way, what will happen?\n\n532\n00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:38.610\nWell, we'll tell you,\nyou know what, we're not sure.\n\n533\n00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:41.160\nWe just don't know because\nnobody's tried it and\n\n534\n00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.960\nwe're not quite sure what will happen.\n\n535\n00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.030\nWe think that courts may interpret\nit this way, but we just don't know.\n\n536\n00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.060\nAnd we're not sure.\n\n537\n00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.230\nAnd until it does happen,\nnobody may know for sure what will happen.\n\n538\n00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.410\nSo it's very interesting in some respects\nto be on the cutting edge of some of this\n\n539\n00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.350\nstuff, but it can also be incredibly\nchallenging, so think about that.\n\n540\n00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.849\n>> Just because you can do something\ndoesn't mean you should do something.\n\n541\n00:26:59.849 --> 00:27:02.358\n>> Well, just because you can do\nsomething doesn't always mean you\n\n542\n00:27:02.358 --> 00:27:04.340\nshould do something, that's very true.\n\n543\n00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.720\nI'm of the opinion that just because\nyou can do something you may or\n\n544\n00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.000\nmay not wanna do it.\n\n545\n00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.575\nI think it's just a matter of\nunderstanding the risks involved before\n\n546\n00:27:11.575 --> 00:27:12.457\nyou make the decision.\n\n547\n00:27:12.457 --> 00:27:16.180\nAnd if the risks are not well documented,\nclear, and understood,\n\n548\n00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.228\nit may be time to step back and let\nsomebody else essentially trod that path\n\n549\n00:27:20.228 --> 00:27:22.950\nin front of you, and\nperhaps blaze a trail.\n\n550\n00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.440\nYou may or may not be of the mindset and\n\n551\n00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.510\nthe opinion that you wanna be on\nthe bleeding edge of every conversation.\n\n552\n00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.850\nSome may be more important than others.\n\n553\n00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:31.790\nSo it is certainly wise guidance\nto at least think about.\n\n554\n00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:32.880\nWhen we think about bit splitting,\n\n555\n00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.090\nthere are two ways we can\nimplement bit splitting.\n\n556\n00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:36.550\nYou may wanna know what they are.\n\n557\n00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:41.980\nSecret Sharing Made Short,\nwhat's called SSMS, and all or\n\n558\n00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.824\nnothing transform with what's\ncalled Read Solomon, AONTRS,\n\n559\n00:27:46.824 --> 00:27:51.070\nRS for Reads Solomon, AONT,\nAll Or Nothing Transform.\n\n560\n00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:54.430\nSo these are the names of two methods\nthat are commonly used for bit splitting.\n\n561\n00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:58.425\nI will not go into great, excruciating,\ntechnical detail about how they work.\n\n562\n00:27:58.425 --> 00:28:00.785\nThis is merely just a point\nof reference for you.\n\n563\n00:28:00.785 --> 00:28:03.956\nIf you are presented a pick list,\na list of options in a question,\n\n564\n00:28:03.956 --> 00:28:07.360\nhypothetically, and we talked about\nbit splitting technologies and\n\n565\n00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.914\nwhich methods are used to\nimplement bit splitting.\n\n566\n00:28:09.914 --> 00:28:15.284\nAnd you're given the names of of five\nbit splitting supposed technologies,\n\n567\n00:28:15.284 --> 00:28:19.752\nyou'd wanna pick out SSMS and\nAONT-RS is the two that are used.\n\n568\n00:28:19.752 --> 00:28:21.138\nAnd whatever the other ones are,\n\n569\n00:28:21.138 --> 00:28:23.872\nyou'd want to know are most likely\nred herrings and bypass them.\n\n570\n00:28:23.872 --> 00:28:28.092\nThat would be the acceptable level to have\na sense of knowledge added to understand,\n\n571\n00:28:28.092 --> 00:28:29.902\nbut you should be aware of bit splitting.\n\n572\n00:28:29.902 --> 00:28:33.032\nYou should be aware of the ways we\nimplement it from a technology perspective\n\n573\n00:28:33.032 --> 00:28:34.160\nnamed as such.\n\n574\n00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.850\nYou at least wanna have a workable\nknowledge of the idea behind\n\n575\n00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:37.780\nbit splitting.\n\n576\n00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.150\nWe also talk about homomorphic encryption.\n\n577\n00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.364\nThis allows us, it's kind of a new\ncutting edge technology concept,\n\n578\n00:28:44.364 --> 00:28:47.274\nnew being a relative term depending\non when you're watching this.\n\n579\n00:28:47.274 --> 00:28:51.200\nIt may not be so new any more, but\nit's relatively new these days.\n\n580\n00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.598\nIt's not widely used but\nit is certainly deployed.\n\n581\n00:28:53.598 --> 00:28:56.740\nThis enables processing encrypted data\nwithout the need to decrypt the data\n\n582\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.570\nfirst.\n\n583\n00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.340\nSo we're actually being able to go in and\nessentially access encrypted data\n\n584\n00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.200\nwithout the encryption-decryption\nprocess having to run.\n\n585\n00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.176\nCloud customers,\n\n586\n00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:09.568\nultimately cloud customers upload data to\na cloud service provider for processing,\n\n587\n00:29:09.568 --> 00:29:13.242\nand are actually able to just do so\nwithout having to decipher the data.\n\n588\n00:29:13.242 --> 00:29:15.080\nThey just upload the encrypted data.\n\n589\n00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.350\nThe cloud provider deals with\nthe data in encrypted form.\n\n590\n00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:20.281\nAnd we don't have to worry about\nthe constant encrypt-decrypt cycles that\n\n591\n00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:21.130\nslow us down.\n\n592\n00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:23.830\nSo it's just another way\nto approach security.\n\n593\n00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:28.180\nWe have to provide encryption keys and use\ncertain kinds of specialized hardware and\n\n594\n00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.960\ncertain kinds of technology\nplatforms to do this.\n\n595\n00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.900\nIt's not widely supported by everybody.\n\n596\n00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.080\nBut it is certainly an option.\n\n597\n00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:39.016\nIt's just another approach, one of many,\nright, anonymization, tokenization,\n\n598\n00:29:39.016 --> 00:29:43.022\nobfuscation, masking, bit splitting,\nhomomorphic encryption.\n\n599\n00:29:43.022 --> 00:29:46.375\nLots of different techniques,\nlots of different terminologies,\n\n600\n00:29:46.375 --> 00:29:49.900\nlots of different items that we can\nuse in order to be able to essentially\n\n601\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.510\nprovide this kind of approach.\n\n602\n00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:54.681\nSo we wanna be thinking about\nthe impact of these things,\n\n603\n00:29:54.681 --> 00:29:57.864\nthinking about the technology\nchoices we make as CCSPs.\n\n604\n00:29:57.864 --> 00:30:01.628\nWhether or not ultimately they lead to\ngood outcomes is as much a matter of us\n\n605\n00:30:01.628 --> 00:30:05.393\nunderstanding how to manage risk as it\nis about understanding how to deploy\n\n606\n00:30:05.393 --> 00:30:07.510\nthese technologies successfully.\n\n607\n00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.690\nVery, very important to think about,\nright?\n\n608\n00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:09.430\n>> Yeah.\nAdam, well,\n\n609\n00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.960\nwe've walked through quite a few\ndata security strategies here.\n\n610\n00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.140\nObviously, encryption was the big dog.\n\n611\n00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.190\nBut these other techniques, too.\n\n612\n00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.030\nWe have the masking, the tokenization and\n\n613\n00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.640\nbit splitting, because that's\njust fun to say, bit splitting.\n\n614\n00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.942\n>> It is.\n>> I'm gonna say that all day long now.\n\n615\n00:30:22.942 --> 00:30:27.694\nOther techniques that you can heap on or\ntake off or use as necessary as you see\n\n616\n00:30:27.694 --> 00:30:31.568\ninside your environment,\nmaybe you'll benefit from that.\n\n617\n00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:34.823\nAnd now that you are aware of it,\nyou can get schooled up on it and\n\n618\n00:30:34.823 --> 00:30:39.000\nstart implementing it inside of your\nenvironment if you so choose to do so.\n\n619\n00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.918\nBut if we don't even know about it,\nthen we can't even do it, right.\n\n620\n00:30:40.918 --> 00:30:43.670\nSo hopefully today was\nan enlightening episode.\n\n621\n00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:44.340\nIt sure was for me.\n\n622\n00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:47.570\nThere's a lot of these technologies,\nsome of this is very new to me.\n\n623\n00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:49.300\nSo I enjoyed this a lot.\n\n624\n00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.790\nWe thank you, Adam, for dropping by.\n\n625\n00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.140\n>> No problem.\n\n626\n00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:56.070\n>> And being that beacon of security\nthat we all need to, maybe even-\n\n627\n00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:57.014\n>> I'll bring my beacon\n\n628\n00:30:57.014 --> 00:30:58.782\nhat next time I come in-\n>> [CROSSTALK] We'll have a little\n\n629\n00:30:58.782 --> 00:30:59.367\nlight spinning around.\n\n630\n00:30:59.367 --> 00:31:02.090\n>> A little light up here,\na little beanie with a beacon on top.\n\n631\n00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.710\n>> All right, everyone, looks like we've\ncome to the end of another episode.\n\n632\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:06.820\nHopefully you've enjoyed it and\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n633\n00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.850\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n634\n00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.360\n>> I'm your beacon of\nencryption knowledge.\n\n635\n00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.140\n>> And there's our beacon.\n\n636\n00:31:12.140

[LAUGH] >> But\nwe must move forward.\n\n12\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.140\n>> That's right.\n\n13\n00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.840\n>> That's a big challenge,\nI was planning on going in reverse for\n\n14\n00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.580\npart of this particular episode.\n\n15\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.820\nSo we'll see if we can live up to\nDaniel's expectations of us and\n\n16\n00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.360\nmove forward with our discussions\nof the cloud security and\n\n17\n00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.800\ncertified security related\nconcerns with regards to cloud.\n\n18\n00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.110\nSo let's continue talking.\n\n19\n00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.510\nWe have, in many of our episodes up until\nnow, I've been talking about cloud data,\n\n20\n00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.560\nand I've been talking about the risks\nassociated with cloud data.\n\n21\n00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.280\nAs we begin to talk\nabout data discovery and\n\n22\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.600\nclassification techniques, we want to\nthink about and really remind ourselves of\n\n23\n00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.960\nsome of the concerns we have\nwith regards to data risks.\n\n24\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.030\nWe apply encryption and\napply technology such as tokenization\n\n25\n00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.990\nto protect data from those that\nare not supposed to see it.\n\n26\n00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.340\nBut in order to do so we have to\nunderstand the value of data and we have\n\n27\n00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.050\nto understand what it is that data has\nthat's important that we wanna protect.\n\n28\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.720\nNot the bits itself, but the meaning of\nthe data in relation to the business and\n\n29\n00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.130\nhow the business or the organization or\nthe enterprise ultimately values data\n\n30\n00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.200\nis really gonna then drive force,\nat least if we do this the right way,\n\n31\n00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.420\nthe need to understand how to then\nprovide protections for data.\n\n32\n00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.250\nSo risk, in other words,\nis commensurate with value,\n\n33\n00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.730\nand we have to understand the things that\nare of high value if placed in harm's way,\n\n34\n00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.870\npresent more of a challenge to us from\na protection and from the perspective of\n\n35\n00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.680\nproviding protection to the organization\nthan things of low value.\n\n36\n00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.590\nSo if you leave something out in the rain,\nright, and\n\n37\n00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.410\npotentially come back and\nfind it weeks or months later.\n\n38\n00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.620\nAnd it's all rusted or dirty or\njust the water destroyed it,\n\n39\n00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.335\nwhatever it was, but it wasn't meaningful\nIf it wasn't important to you.\n\n40\n00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:14.135\nYou may say wow that's kind of bad and\nI feel horrible I did that, but\n\n41\n00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.805\nthe reality is I didn't really\nlose anything of value, right?\n\n42\n00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:19.825\nBut if you do that with something or\nif you do that to something\n\n43\n00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:22.535\nthat is very valuable you're\nreally gonna feel that loss and\n\n44\n00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:26.085\nyou're gonna be kicking yourself for doing\nsomething that obviously put the data or,\n\n45\n00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:29.275\nin this case, put the device or\nwhatever it was in harms way.\n\n46\n00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:33.110\nSo in order to understand\nthe value the data has\n\n47\n00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.530\nin the organization we have to think about\nrating or ranking value in some way.\n\n48\n00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.020\nAnd data classification helps us to do\nthis but in order to classified data,\n\n49\n00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.270\nwe have to really think about\nwhat data is and to find data and\n\n50\n00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.110\ndiscovered data that we can then Manage\nand classify in order to protect and so\n\n51\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.620\nwe have to really think through\nthe logic of what we're doing with data\n\n52\n00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.530\nto understand how to\napproach protecting it.\n\n53\n00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.110\nAs CCSPs in other words\nit's very important for\n\n54\n00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.495\nus to understand that not all data\nis equal, and as a result of that,\n\n55\n00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:01.105\nnot all data deserves equal protection.\n\n56\n00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:03.245\nAnd that's something we\nhave to think about and\n\n57\n00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.705\nreally internalize as we\nbegin this conversation.\n\n58\n00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:09.455\nWhere we dispersed at as we've talked\nabout potentially one of the opportunities\n\n59\n00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.522\nto provide protection maybe through bit\ndispersal and sprinkling bits liberally\n\n60\n00:03:13.522 --> 00:03:17.952\naround our data hosting environments may\nafford us additional layers of protection.\n\n61\n00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:22.042\nThis can both increase protection but\nalso increase risk and vulnerability.\n\n62\n00:03:22.042 --> 00:03:24.982\nData can become corrupted when\nit's stored in multiple locations\n\n63\n00:03:24.982 --> 00:03:28.192\nsimultaneously because a failure\nin any one of those locations\n\n64\n00:03:28.192 --> 00:03:30.752\ncan lead to data corruption\nthroughout the entire system.\n\n65\n00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:32.802\nSo we have to think about the pros and\nthe cons.\n\n66\n00:03:32.802 --> 00:03:36.462\nWe often do what's called a cost benefit\nanalysis in order to understand whether\n\n67\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.570\na certain approach to data hosting may or\nmay not make sense.\n\n68\n00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.740\nHigh value data may have to be stored,\nmanaged and\n\n69\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.140\nmaintained centrally to truly understand\nhow to apply the proper level of controls\n\n70\n00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.620\nto safeguard that data appropriately.\n\n71\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.490\nLow value data may be able to be dispersed\nbecause we may not as worried about\n\n72\n00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.240\nlosing access to that data over time.\n\n73\n00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.365\nAnd so there's not a wrong and\nright approach.\n\n74\n00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:02.800\nThere's not a one size fits all\nconversation that takes place.\n\n75\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.134\nThis is as we've talked about before,\na very specific one size fits one tailored\n\n76\n00:04:07.134 --> 00:04:10.578\nconversation that takes place\nover time and evolves over time,\n\n77\n00:04:10.578 --> 00:04:14.960\nbased on the need and the perceived\nvalue of the data to the organization.\n\n78\n00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.680\nCertain data grows in importance over\ntime, others may diminish over time.\n\n79\n00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.690\nAnd so\nwe have to think about that as well.\n\n80\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.100\nA patient record that is of a current\npatient, actively spending time with us\n\n81\n00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.860\nin a medical establishment is gonna\nbe equally valuable to any other, or\n\n82\n00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.190\nconsidered to be equally valuable,\n\n83\n00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.100\nas any other patient that's\nactively Ii our practice.\n\n84\n00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.520\nBut a patient that has\nnot been to see us and\n\n85\n00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.100\nperhaps has decided to transfer to another\nhealth provider, while not as valuable to\n\n86\n00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.560\nus in the sense that they're actively\na patient still must be protected.\n\n87\n00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.840\nAnd that record must be afforded\nthe same general level of protection\n\n88\n00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.600\nthat the active patient's record does,\na getter is entitled to under\n\n89\n00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.710\nlaws in the United States such as HIPAA\nand the HITECH Act, right, where we have\n\n90\n00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.470\nto be thinking about the healthcare\nconcerns or the privacy concerns of\n\n91\n00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.250\nhealthcare providers as well as healthcare\ncustomers in the United States.\n\n92\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.040\nWe have to safeguard those EHRs,\n\n93\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.730\nthe Electronic Health Records\nof those individuals\n\n94\n00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.730\npretty much consistently across the board\nat the same level of protection.\n\n95\n00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.920\nBut when we think about what kind of\nprotection goes into protecting or\n\n96\n00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.950\nto offer the protection that goes into\nsafeguarding data that is archived,\n\n97\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.250\nthat may be at a different level and\nthat may be of a different type and\n\n98\n00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.740\ntherefore use a different technology and\n\n99\n00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.920\na different approach than data\nthat's actively being used everyday.\n\n100\n00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.460\nSo we have to understand how to rank,\nrate and therefore prioritize data,\n\n101\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.910\ndata support and the ultimate value of\ndata with regards to safeguarding data.\n\n102\n00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.410\nSo it's very important for us.\n\n103\n00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.510\nData discovery allows us\nto work with data and\n\n104\n00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.010\nextract the value of it by finding it but\nalso going through and\n\n105\n00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.160\nunderstanding where data lives and what it\nmeans allows us to better interpret and\n\n106\n00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.500\ntherefore understand the kinds of\ndata that may exist in our systems.\n\n107\n00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.600\nWe may find meaningful and\n\n108\n00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.860\nimportant information in places where\nbefore, we didn't think it existed.\n\n109\n00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.740\nThe data science technologies that\nwe're bringing to bear today around and\n\n110\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.730\nunder the guise of big data,\ndata visualization and\n\n111\n00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.970\ndata analytics and business intelligence\ntend to focus in these areas.\n\n112\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.720\nWe take huge volumes of data\nseemingly unrelated and\n\n113\n00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.470\nwe then strive through analytics and\nthrough data processing and\n\n114\n00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.540\nthrough aggregation and through inference\nand many of the techniques that we use.\n\n115\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.890\nWe actually strive to\nuncover hidden value or\n\n116\n00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.610\nhidden relationships that may\nnot be apparent on the surface.\n\n117\n00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.970\nAnd so you ever play the game\nwhen you were a kid, I don't\n\n118\n00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.180\nknow if you everdid this, it's called\ndifferent things by different people but\n\n119\n00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.280\nyou ever play something\ncalled back to bacon?\n\n120\n00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.353\n>> Back to bacon?\n\n121\n00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:33.993\nCan't say that I have.\n\n122\n00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.071\nNot by that name anyway.\n\n123\n00:06:35.071 --> 00:06:36.093\n>> So the idea\n>> Anyway\n\n124\n00:06:36.093 --> 00:06:37.626\n>> You may not have played it by\n\n125\n00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:42.030\nthat name but the idea generically is,\nyou know Kevin Bacon, the actor?\n\n126\n00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.390\n>> Yes, yes\n>> You know the game where you start out\n\n127\n00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.590\nwith a movie and you have to find out how\nto relate it to something he's been in,\n\n128\n00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.100\nor something?\n\n129\n00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.840\n>> I heard it's called 6\ndegrees of Kevin Bacon\n\n130\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.879\n>> 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon,\n\n131\n00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.509\nback to Bacon, it's called different\nthings by different people.\n\n132\n00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:58.322\nBut it's kind of an analogy,\na way of explaining this idea of data\n\n133\n00:06:58.322 --> 00:07:03.223\naggregation and inference because\nif we can find the hidden path,\n\n134\n00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:06.811\nthat takes us from something\nlike I don't know,\n\n135\n00:07:06.811 --> 00:07:11.538\nFlying Leathernecks,\nthe 1941 movie that John Wayne was in\n\n136\n00:07:11.538 --> 00:07:16.785\nabout United States Marine Corps\naviators in the second World War.\n\n137\n00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:21.710\nAnd take that and\nrelate that back to Footloose, right,\n\n138\n00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:25.450\nultimately where Kevin Bacon as a star\nby jumping through different movies\n\n139\n00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.200\nthat have a, you know essentially\na lineage from one of those actors all\n\n140\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.350\nthe way through that kinda\ncomes the modern day.\n\n141\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.120\nThat's generally the idea behind the game,\nright?\n\n142\n00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.684\nAnd it's played under different guys,\n\n143\n00:07:33.684 --> 00:07:35.892\nthis with different actors\nI'm sure all over the world.\n\n144\n00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:39.227\nBut the point is generically if\nwe could do something like that,\n\n145\n00:07:39.227 --> 00:07:42.747\nthen we're able to find that hidden\npath that meaning in that data or\n\n146\n00:07:42.747 --> 00:07:47.073\nthat seemingly unrelated strings of data\nthat those movies indeed have some sort of\n\n147\n00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:51.705\ncommon, shared, in this case actor writer\nshared lineage, maybe, it's a director,\n\n148\n00:07:51.705 --> 00:07:55.775\nwhatever it is, but the idea is that\nthat's how you get from one to the other.\n\n149\n00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:57.130\nAnd so it's hopping.\n\n150\n00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.220\nYou ever play the movie,\nthe movie, listen to me.\n\n151\n00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.027\nYou ever play the video game,\nwe're talking about old video games, and\n\n152\n00:08:02.027 --> 00:08:03.651\nyou're just like a Pac Man on the ghosts.\n\n153\n00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:04.538\nDid you ever play Frogger?\n\n154\n00:08:04.538 --> 00:08:05.078\nYeah.\n\n155\n00:08:05.078 --> 00:08:05.578\n>> Remember Frogger?\n\n156\n00:08:05.578 --> 00:08:06.855\n>> Yeah.\nFrogger was my jam.\n\n157\n00:08:06.855 --> 00:08:07.916\n>> So you know when you were jumping,\n\n158\n00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:09.499\nright, the frog was trying\nto get across the road.\n\n159\n00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:13.160\nThis is really old school,\nwhat we call old G video gaming.\n\n160\n00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.680\nFirst or second generation.\n\n161\n00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.360\nBack in the day.\n\n162\n00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.910\nI actually remember.\n\n163\n00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.590\nWe were in the, my family was\nin the restaurant business for\n\n164\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.030\nmany years early on.\n\n165\n00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.990\nI remember that my dad in\none of our restaurants\n\n166\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.410\nhad one of the original Pong games.\n\n167\n00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.500\nThe tabletop Pong games\nwhen it first came out.\n\n168\n00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.000\nThe ones they would put in bars and\nrestaurants you would sit down at.\n\n169\n00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.450\nRoughly like the table we're at here but\nyou know a slightly smaller version.\n\n170\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.320\nAnd it was you know the glass top table\nand you have the controls on either\n\n171\n00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.240\nend and you essentially would play,\nyou know, table tennis on a video game.\n\n172\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.920\nWith Palm.\n\n173\n00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.870\nBut I remember, when I was a kid growing\nup, I remember when that first came out.\n\n174\n00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.290\nSo I'm just ancient.\n\n175\n00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.630\nI am as old as the dinosaurs as they say.\n\n176\n00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.080\nBut if you played Frogger, you remember\nyou're trying to get across the road or\n\n177\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.180\njump on the logs to get across the river,\nand yet\n\n178\n00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:58.330\nyou're jumping from one safe zone to\nanother to navigate your way through.\n\n179\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.240\nHaving to find that path.\n\n180\n00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.400\nAnd this is really all just\nanalogies about the same thing.\n\n181\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.420\nData discovery is really about this and\nthis concept.\n\n182\n00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.350\nSo we could call data discovery Frogger.\n\n183\n00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.740\nOr we could call data discovery six\ndegrees of separation from Kevin Bacon and\n\n184\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.400\nit would essentially be the same thing.\n\n185\n00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.050\nSo I'm gonna re-brand data discovery.\n\n186\n00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.200\n>> From here on in, we will now\nrefer to data discover as frogger.\n\n187\n00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:21.050\n>> As Frogger, that will just be the new\nname for data discovery in the cloud.\n\n188\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.550\nSo when we think about data discovery,\nright, we're thinking about,\n\n189\n00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.680\nas I said, big data,\n\n190\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.760\nrealtime analytics, agile business\nintelligence related functionality.\n\n191\n00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.620\nThere's all these different discovery\ntechniques that we can use,\n\n192\n00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.960\nmetadata becomes very important here.\n\n193\n00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.680\nData about data, or information about data\nthat is descriptive in nature but is very,\n\n194\n00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.170\nvery important for us to consider\nfrom a security perspective and\n\n195\n00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.800\nfrom a risk management perspective.\n\n196\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.140\nA lot of times,\nmetadata can give away the intent and\n\n197\n00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.570\nmeaning of the data inside of a hidden or\nencrypted file.\n\n198\n00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.130\nAnd if we don't protect the metadata\nthe same way we protect the other data,\n\n199\n00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.370\nwe may actually give away.\n\n200\n00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.580\nThe confidentiality or compromise the\nintegrity and availability without really\n\n201\n00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.970\nactually setting out to, and\nwithout thinking we are.\n\n202\n00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.520\nBut we could without meaning to.\n\n203\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.880\nData labeling is very important,\ndescribing data properly so\n\n204\n00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.630\nwe understand it's value,\nwithout giving away information about it,\n\n205\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.620\nis a very important, very subtle, but\nvery important thing that a cloud security\n\n206\n00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.820\nprofessional needs to think about and\nbe aware of.\n\n207\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.580\nAnd content analysis,\nwhat is the meaning of the data?\n\n208\n00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.930\nWhat kind of inferences can we make,\nwhat kind of aggregations can we make.\n\n209\n00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.070\nWhen we talk about this,\n\n210\n00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.730\nnot in any of our conversations or\nany of the episodes so far, but\n\n211\n00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:35.460\nI talk about this with my security\nclasses outside of this format perse.\n\n212\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.480\nBut generically when I teach CISP classes,\nwhen I teach architecture,\n\n213\n00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.870\nwhen I teach hacking, whatever it may be,\nwe talk about the idea.\n\n214\n00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.670\nThat you know there's a lot of descriptive\ndata that exists in our systems that we\n\n215\n00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:49.880\njust bypass and\ndon't even think of everyday.\n\n216\n00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.730\nSo for instance user accounts\ncreated in directory services.\n\n217\n00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:57.460\nWhether they are in Microsoft active\ndirectory or an open ldap system or\n\n218\n00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.590\non a local machine whatever it may be.\n\n219\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.600\nIf you pull up a user account and go and\n\n220\n00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.550\nlook at the description of the user\naccount created by the operating system.\n\n221\n00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.580\nNot only what you create,\n\n222\n00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.370\nbut the description of the active\nadministrator account, or\n\n223\n00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.330\nthe domain admin account, or enterprise\nadmin account, or whatever that is.\n\n224\n00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.210\nYou will find that the description says,\nthis is the admin account for the machine,\n\n225\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.800\nor the admin account for the directory,\nor for the namespace, or\n\n226\n00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.210\nwhatever When we rename\nthat admin account,\n\n227\n00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:26.325\nwhich we're told to do as a best practice\nto the machine we may rename it.\n\n228\n00:11:26.325 --> 00:11:29.950\nSo instead of calling it administrator,\nwe call it George or\n\n229\n00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.100\nwhatever that name would be that we\ntry to hide the admin account with.\n\n230\n00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.695\nOn the surface that seems to do the job\nbut the problem is if somebody profiles\n\n231\n00:11:36.695 --> 00:11:39.645\nthe user accounts and\nlooks at as we know the CID or\n\n232\n00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:44.225\nthe GUID they will find that it is gonna\nhave a 500 which will mean admin so\n\n233\n00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:47.910\nwe can't hide that cuz that's natively\nbuilt in and we cannot modify that.\n\n234\n00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.210\nAnd if we pull the full metadata on the\naccount, we see the account descriptor.\n\n235\n00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:56.625\nAnd if you don't rename the account and\nwipeout that description and\n\n236\n00:11:56.625 --> 00:12:00.500\nre-purpose it, it's still as labeled\ndomain admin account in the descriptor\n\n237\n00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.590\neven though the name\nitself is been changed.\n\n238\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.630\nSo you know a lot of times we\ndon't realize all the nooks and\n\n239\n00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.700\ncrannies all the places that\nthis data potentially lives.\n\n240\n00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.040\nAnd it's the same in the Cloud.\n\n241\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.220\nRight remember just cuz we slapped the\nword cloud in front of something doesn't\n\n242\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.320\nnecessarily change the common sense\napproach we need to bring to the table.\n\n243\n00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:19.900\nAs a matter of fact it amplifies it and\nmakes it even more important.\n\n244\n00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:23.700\nSo if we're not renaming if we're not\nobsfucating if we're not masking if we're\n\n245\n00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.890\nnot good at finding all of\nthe meta data and accounting for\n\n246\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:30.250\nall of that is part of our protection\nprofile, we're not actually doing our job.\n\n247\n00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.900\nWe're not exercising due care,\n\n248\n00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.750\nwe're not using due diligence\nin our oversight function.\n\n249\n00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.820\nWe are, in other words, not effectively\nexecuting the proper steps and\n\n250\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.620\nthe proper levels of protection\nthat we as Cloud security\n\n251\n00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.140\nprofessionals need to bring to the table.\n\n252\n00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.560\nThis is very important for\nus to consider and to think about.\n\n253\n00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.610\nIt would be like driving a car, but\n\n254\n00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.550\nreally not understanding how to do\nanything other than drive straight.\n\n255\n00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.990\nNot understanding how\nto safely change lanes.\n\n256\n00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:54.230\nHow to safely stop.\n\n257\n00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:57.260\nBut simply just go forward without ever\nworrying about anything around you or\n\n258\n00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.000\nin front of you.\n\n259\n00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.670\nMany people do drive this\nway on a regular basis and\n\n260\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:03.350\nseem to have no trouble with it, at least\nin South Florida, from what I've seen.\n\n261\n00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.612\n>> That's the common driving\nmethod here in Gainesville.\n\n262\n00:13:05.612 --> 00:13:06.729\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well in South Florida,\n\n263\n00:13:06.729 --> 00:13:08.860\nit's also where I come from\n>> It's also very common,\n\n264\n00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.190\nand we tend to see quite\na bit of that on the highway.\n\n265\n00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.520\nAs distressing as that may be, and\n\n266\n00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.490\nI'm sure it may be common in your\nparts of the world where you are.\n\n267\n00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.320\nBut if you think about the logic of that,\n\n268\n00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.150\nit's highly unsafe to operate a motor\nvehicle without knowing how to stop.\n\n269\n00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.680\nIt's just not real practical.\n\n270\n00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.170\nAt least not unless you are never\ngonna run out fo space and\n\n271\n00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.240\nno one's ever around you.\n\n272\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.240\nAnd it's highly unlikely you can\noperate a vehicle successfully\n\n273\n00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.260\nwithout being able to change lanes,\nturning left and right, backing up.\n\n274\n00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:36.000\n>> And on occasion perhaps circling\naround cuz you missed an opportunity to\n\n275\n00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:36.580\ndo something.\n\n276\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.040\nAnd so you have aware of all\nthese things and these skills.\n\n277\n00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:43.360\nAnd being prepared to do the job is part\nof the requirement of being successful.\n\n278\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.740\nAnd so we have to think about the issues\nassociated with data, data management, and\n\n279\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.730\ndata discovery.\n\n280\n00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.400\nPoor data quality can obviously\nbe a major issue here.\n\n281\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.930\nGarbage in garbage out as we often say.\n\n282\n00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.580\nDashboards.\n\n283\n00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.340\nHow do we actually visualize the data?\n\n284\n00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.630\n>> How do we present it?\n\n285\n00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.050\nThe appropriateness of communication and\n\n286\n00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.770\nthe appropriate level of communication\nto the audience's involved is very,\n\n287\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.420\nvery important for our understanding\non how to manage effectively.\n\n288\n00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.480\nWe may have valuable insight,\nif we don't display them and\n\n289\n00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.090\ncommunicate them effectively\n>> then really nobody is going to benefit\n\n290\n00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:14.030\nfrom them, and that's going to be\na very big issue for us to consider.\n\n291\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.630\nWhat about the hidden\ncosts in managing data?\n\n292\n00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.190\nYou know, there may be costs associated\nwith being able to analyze data,\n\n293\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.750\nbeing able to visualize it,\nbeing able to maintain it,\n\n294\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.100\nand being able to maintain\navailability of the data.\n\n295\n00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.150\nAnd we have to account for\nthose, both hard and soft costs.\n\n296\n00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:32.090\nTraining people with data and\nelitic skills and\n\n297\n00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.240\ntraining them in BI capabilities, and\ntraining them reporting and dash boarding,\n\n298\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.570\nthese are skills people have to be taught\nhow to do and to use and to be good at.\n\n299\n00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.330\nIt's not something intuitively that people\nnecessarily understand how to do, and\n\n300\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.110\nas a result, there are many costs\nassociated with data management.\n\n301\n00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.070\nWhat types of data will be made\navailable under what conditions, and\n\n302\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.020\nthrough what expectations for usage?\n\n303\n00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.350\nWe have to consider these things.\n\n304\n00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.590\nWhere will data be located?\n\n305\n00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.620\nHow will we get to it?\n\n306\n00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.460\nUnder what conditions can we access it?\n\n307\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.700\nWith what applications?\n\n308\n00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.750\nWith what assumptions these are things\nthat security professionals\n\n309\n00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.210\nwould have to consider as well.\n\n310\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:08.150\nWhat access levels will be acceptable,\nwhat kinds of conditions on access will we\n\n311\n00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.860\nprovide, and will we maintain and\nimplement, these are important as well.\n\n312\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.435\nWhat Protection levels are appropriate\nbased on the legal ramifications and\n\n313\n00:15:15.435 --> 00:15:18.565\nrequirements based on a statutory\nperspective that we have to address.\n\n314\n00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:20.315\nIn other words,\nhow do we implement compliance?\n\n315\n00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:23.455\nAnd how do we show compliance\nwith data management?\n\n316\n00:15:23.455 --> 00:15:26.320\nThese are important things for\nus to consider with regards to data\n\n317\n00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:30.410\nclassification, classification categories,\nthe data type, the format,\n\n318\n00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.930\nthe structure, the jurisdiction as\nwe said, very important to consider.\n\n319\n00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.040\nContext in ownership,\nvery important to consider as well.\n\n320\n00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.200\nWe have to think about the contractual\nconstraints that may exist\n\n321\n00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.070\nbetween parties.\n\n322\n00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.620\nWith regards to access to data,\ntrust levels between partners,\n\n323\n00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.800\nhow much data will we expose and\n\n324\n00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.590\nas a result how much data can we expect\nto see, value sensitivity criticality,\n\n325\n00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.310\nthese are all contributory factors\nwith regards to data classification.\n\n326\n00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.541\nAny obligations for attention And\npreservation would also have\n\n327\n00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:00.365\nto be considered and\nhave to be thought about, as well.\n\n328\n00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:04.196\nIt's very, very important for us to\nconsider the broad-ranging implications of\n\n329\n00:16:04.196 --> 00:16:08.190\ndata and its meaning in the world today,\nbecause it's not just us typically, right,\n\n330\n00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.673\nas individual customers\nthat may be consuming data.\n\n331\n00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:14.324\nBut rather maybe our partners that we have\nto worry about and that we would think\n\n332\n00:16:14.324 --> 00:16:17.313\nthrough the logic of how our partners\nare gonna value our data and\n\n333\n00:16:17.313 --> 00:16:21.570\nhow are gonna value theirs, in a federated\norganization or a federated structure.\n\n334\n00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.760\nAnd when we think about\npartnerships in the Cloud,\n\n335\n00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.350\nwe often talk about federation,\nsharing our resources and\n\n336\n00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.910\nour access to those resources with\nour partners becomes very important.\n\n337\n00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:34.700\nThat's part of the Cloud enablement\nthat cloud technology often brings to\n\n338\n00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.490\norganizations, broad, remember,\nand ubiquitous access on demand\n\n339\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.080\nmaking information available broadly\non demand across multiple areas of our\n\n340\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.370\nbusiness is one of the key enablers and\nkey value propositions of the Cloud.\n\n341\n00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.190\nChallenges with the Cloud and\nCloud classification of data.\n\n342\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.880\nData creation, classification controls,\n\n343\n00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.310\nthe use of meta-data control of it as\nwe've said, re-classification over time.\n\n344\n00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:00.660\nThe need to remember we have to cycle back\nand examine and look at data and every so\n\n345\n00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:05.020\noften whether it's semi annually, whether\nit's bi-annually, whether it's monthly,\n\n346\n00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:05.890\nwhether it's every other year,\n\n347\n00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.827\nwhatever it may be that we have\nto essentially re-assess data.\n\n348\n00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.410\nAnd be classified data\nis very important for\n\n349\n00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:15.960\nus to consider and\nto be aware of this as well.\n\n350\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:20.190\nYou know we can't just say, okay today\ndata is essentially top secret and then it\n\n351\n00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:24.740\nnever ever during the retention period\nof maybe 50 years hypnotically of data.\n\n352\n00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.840\nIs retained for 50 years at top\nsecret level, never go back and\n\n353\n00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.040\nreassess whether that data\nis indeed still top secret.\n\n354\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.580\nIt may very well be for that whole 50 year\nperiod, it may be that it's no longer\n\n355\n00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.210\nsecret because maybe all the people\ninvolved with that or long since gone, and\n\n356\n00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.890\nwe can declassify that data.\n\n357\n00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.060\nWe wouldn't know unless we go back and\nexamine it.\n\n358\n00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:46.050\nAnd one of the other things to consider\nwith regards to classification and\n\n359\n00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.310\nwith regards to data controls, is the\nprotection mechanisms with that retention.\n\n360\n00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.675\nSo a lot of times we\ntalk about encryption for\n\n361\n00:17:52.675 --> 00:17:56.415\ninstance and we've talked about the value\nof encryption, how encryption is applied,\n\n362\n00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:58.185\nwhy we use it, under what circumstances.\n\n363\n00:17:58.185 --> 00:17:59.065\nWe talked about all of that.\n\n364\n00:17:59.065 --> 00:18:02.775\nWhat we haven't really spent a lot of\ntime on is the time span that encryption\n\n365\n00:18:02.775 --> 00:18:04.315\nactually offers protection for.\n\n366\n00:18:04.315 --> 00:18:07.965\nAnd there's really no good way to know for\nsure, but we can estimate.\n\n367\n00:18:07.965 --> 00:18:09.200\nSo, for instance, right?\n\n368\n00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.615\nWe'll play a game with me real quick?\n\n369\n00:18:10.615 --> 00:18:12.000\nYeah, let's try.\n\n370\n00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.720\nRemember war games?\n\n371\n00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.690\nDo you wanna play a game?\n\n372\n00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.630\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n373\n00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:15.300\n>> So, you know if we\n\n374\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.380\nthink about encryption and we think about\nthe fact that in many cases under many\n\n375\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.730\ncircumstances we will use not\nmainline encryption algorithms.\n\n376\n00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:28.180\nI mentioned AES in one of our prior\nepisodes the advanced encryption standards\n\n377\n00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.710\nis replacing DES for most encryption\nsymptoms today, because DES and\n\n378\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.460\nwhat you may know DES as\nis more likely triple DES.\n\n379\n00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:39.300\nDES with three dash DES, is an algorithm\nthat has been around for many,\n\n380\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.170\nmany years is still considered to\nbe a good algorithm in certain very\n\n381\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.140\nnarrowly different circumstances,\nbut has proven to be\n\n382\n00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.350\nunfortunately breakable because of the\nadvance and the advances in technology.\n\n383\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.820\nAnd is no longer considered to be strong\nenough to provide adequate encryption\n\n384\n00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.060\nprotection, for the government, for\nthe military things of the that nature.\n\n385\n00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.650\nSo we tend to see and move away from\nthat and have over the last five or\n\n386\n00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.360\nsix years or so, and AES has now\nbecome the standard that we use.\n\n387\n00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.820\nIt's a stronger algorithm, and\n\n388\n00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:09.020\nit's considered to be therefore able to\nprovide protection longer into the future.\n\n389\n00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.870\nSo when we look at something like AES,\nwe look at the encryption offered by that,\n\n390\n00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.290\nwe measure an algorithm based\non it's bit strength and\n\n391\n00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.000\nit's ability to provide protection is\nrated or ranked based on a bit strength.\n\n392\n00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.960\nSo a 128 bit encryption algorithm,\nis stronger than a 56 bit but\n\n393\n00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:28.570\nnot as strong as a 192 bit algorithm and\nyou can progressively walk that up.\n\n394\n00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.290\nUp to, you know, 2048 bit,\n\n395\n00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:35.460\n4096 bit, in many cases, where the top\nend of many of those protection schemes.\n\n396\n00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.084\nNow the bigger the bit strength or the\nbigger the bit rating on the algorithm,\n\n397\n00:19:39.084 --> 00:19:42.762\nthe stronger the algorithm is, the bigger\nthe key is, and the more keys that we\n\n398\n00:19:42.762 --> 00:19:46.140\ngenerate and the key space to\npotentially randomly associate the key.\n\n399\n00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.280\nAnd therefor the broader the playing field\nof random choices we have to find the key\n\n400\n00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.190\nthat's just a very high level generic\nconcepts behind encryption, right?\n\n401\n00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.460\nWelcome to encryption\nin 30 seconds with me.\n\n402\n00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.700\nI'm your host, Speedy Gonzalez and\nwe'll be talking about encryption today.\n\n403\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.480\nRight, so when we think about\nsummarizing that concept, that's very,\n\n404\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.840\nvery high level sketch.\n\n405\n00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.280\nBut in order to play the game,\nwe have to understand the rules, right?\n\n406\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.340\nSo those are the operational rules of\nour game here, regards to encryption.\n\n407\n00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.440\nSo if we decide to use AES, right?\n\n408\n00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.115\nWe decide to encrypt data.\n\n409\n00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:18.574\nI implement AES, and\nAES can be implemented as a 128,\n\n410\n00:20:18.574 --> 00:20:20.744\n192, or 256 bit algorithm.\n\n411\n00:20:20.744 --> 00:20:25.280\nAnd we have three options, traditionally,\ntoday, in most systems that use AES.\n\n412\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.790\nIt's a variable strength algorithm.\n\n413\n00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.730\nSo if we implemented a 128 bit,\nat the low end of the scale, but\n\n414\n00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.770\nstill strong by comparison\nto many algorithms.\n\n415\n00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.184\nAre we gonna afford protection,\nfor the data?\n\n416\n00:20:35.184 --> 00:20:39.860\nLet's say hypothetically for,\nlet's just make it simple a 100,000 years.\n\n417\n00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.570\nWhether that's the actual\nprotection level or\n\n418\n00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.280\nnot is not really important we just\nwanna demonstrate a point right?\n\n419\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.840\nSo we're gonna say 100,000\nyears into the future.\n\n420\n00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.230\nNow you'll protect that data.\n\n421\n00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.290\nYou'll say Adam I've got to\nprotect my data for 100,000 years.\n\n422\n00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.880\nAnd I'm gonna use AES 128 bit to do so.\n\n423\n00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:57.390\nAnd for the next 100,000 years\nthat data is gonna be good and\n\n424\n00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:00.490\nI'm never gonna have to worry\nabout re-encrypting that data or\n\n425\n00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.770\nprotecting it cuz it's good for\na 100,000 years.\n\n426\n00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.130\nAnd I'll look at you Daniel and\nI would say, wow,\n\n427\n00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.640\nthat's pretty cool, how do you know that?\n\n428\n00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.450\nAnd you'll say, well so and so\ntold me that if I encrypted that way for\n\n429\n00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.700\na 100,000 it will never, assuming\nnobody obviously finds the key where,\n\n430\n00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.420\ncuz I leave it around,\nI do something silly and\n\n431\n00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.280\nI violate Kirchhoff's principle\nof keeping the key secure.\n\n432\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.040\nAs long as I do that,\n\n433\n00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.840\nnobody is gonna be able to break\nthat encryption for a 100,000 years.\n\n434\n00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.530\nAnd I'll say, Daniel that's\ngreat except for one problem.\n\n435\n00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.390\nYou forgot one very, very important thing.\n\n436\n00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.330\nRight?\nYou forgot the fact that technology\n\n437\n00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.445\ncontinues to evolve and the encryption\nalgorithm is essentially standing still,\n\n438\n00:21:32.445 --> 00:21:33.210\n[LAUGH] right?\n\n439\n00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.740\nSo the encryption algorithm is here,\n\n440\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.490\nright, providing protection and all around\nit is moving all the technologies and\n\n441\n00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.070\nall the capabilities that we use\nto essentially un-encrypt data.\n\n442\n00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:46.770\nAnd over time that protection that\nthe encryption algorithm provides\n\n443\n00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:49.250\nout of 100,000 years\nis chipped away at it,\n\n444\n00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:51.930\nwe have many,\nmany infrawaves of representatives, but\n\n445\n00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.740\none way we often talk about this is\nto something known as Moore's Law.\n\n446\n00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.620\nAbout Moore's Law, Gordon Moore,\none of the founders of Intel?\n\n447\n00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.150\n>> Negative.\n\n448\n00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.690\n>> Okay, so Gordon Moore, one of\nthe founders of Intel, came up with this\n\n449\n00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:09.440\nconcept, and it's been named in his honor\nover time, we refer to as Moore's Law.\n\n450\n00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:14.150\nHe postulated, and turns out correctly\n[LAUGH] as a result of what he said that,\n\n451\n00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.760\nbecause of the advent in technology,\nspecifically in this case computing power,\n\n452\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.510\nprocessing power, that it roughly\nwould double every so many years or\n\n453\n00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.170\nmonths depending on where\nyou look at it on the arc.\n\n454\n00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.680\nThat essentially over time, on a bell\ncurve, our processing power gets greater,\n\n455\n00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.300\nand therefore the protection mechanisms\nafforded by the algorithm shrink,\n\n456\n00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.070\nbecause the time value needed\nto break the encryption\n\n457\n00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:40.210\nis gonna be chipped away by the advance or\nthe advances in processor technology.\n\n458\n00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.540\nAnd it turns out, not only was he correct.\n\n459\n00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:45.320\nBut boy, was he correct,\nbecause when he first thought this out and\n\n460\n00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:48.980\ntalked about this, you know,\n30 or so years ago now,\n\n461\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.830\nthe technology doubling time was over\na year, but the reality now is that these\n\n462\n00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.860\ndays it's below a year, it's actually\nabout nine months approximately right now.\n\n463\n00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.020\nAnd about every nine months architecture,\nprocessing power essentially doubles.\n\n464\n00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.219\nAnd as a result of that,\na 100,000 year protection,\n\n465\n00:23:04.219 --> 00:23:08.530\ntoday less than a year from now is\nessentially only good for 50,000 years.\n\n466\n00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.680\nAnd so if you do that math and\nwalk it out logically,\n\n467\n00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.680\nif you say that let's say\n24 months you'll have three\n\n468\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:21.920\ncycles of 9 months each approximately\nis roughly about I know it's 27 but\n\n469\n00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.310\nlet's say it's roughly 24 months, about\ntwo years that about every two years,\n\n470\n00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.350\nwe are chipping away at that and\ncutting that by half every time.\n\n471\n00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.240\nThen essentially what\nhappens is we go to 50,000,\n\n472\n00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:35.760\nthen we go to 25,000 and\nthen we go to 12,500.\n\n473\n00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.480\nSo within two years we've essentially\ncut down that 100,000 year window\n\n474\n00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.370\nby a significant amount almost 30%.\n\n475\n00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:43.980\nRight?\n\n476\n00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.870\nAnd that's over 80%.\n\n477\n00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:50.102\nThat's a really, really big problem\nif we're only thinking it's good for\n\n478\n00:23:50.102 --> 00:23:54.150\na 100,000 years and two years later\nit's good for less than, under 20 or\n\n479\n00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.220\nless than, or just over 12 or\nless than 15.\n\n480\n00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.535\nI'm struggling with my math here.\n\n481\n00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:00.007\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm good on a good day if I get two\n\n482\n00:24:00.007 --> 00:24:03.779\nplus two to equal four and that's about\nthe extent of my mathematic capabilities.\n\n483\n00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:05.894\nSo, you get the general idea.\n\n484\n00:24:05.894 --> 00:24:06.846\nMy point with this is.\n\n485\n00:24:06.846 --> 00:24:09.305\nNot so\nmuch to play a numbers games with you but\n\n486\n00:24:09.305 --> 00:24:13.842\nto get you understand that as a security\nprofessional just because something seems\n\n487\n00:24:13.842 --> 00:24:16.470\nlike an unreasonably long amount of time.\n\n488\n00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:19.590\nOn the surface from a protection\nperspective doesn't mean that protection\n\n489\n00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.960\nis gonna hold through because\neverything around us is moving and so\n\n490\n00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.320\nwe have to re-evaluate our protection\nmechanisms on a yearly basis.\n\n491\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.980\nTo understand that during that\nretention lifecycle of 50 years,\n\n492\n00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.810\nthat 100,000 year protection\nwould not hold true for\n\n493\n00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.970\nmuch more than probably three of four,\nmaybe five years at the most.\n\n494\n00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.600\nSo one-tenth of the way into the retention\nperiod that encryption algorithm and\n\n495\n00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.320\nthe protection that it provides in our\nexample essentially would be done.\n\n496\n00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.430\nSomebody could potentially\nguess the key and\n\n497\n00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.400\nbreak that encryption within five years.\n\n498\n00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.880\nNow, five years is a very long time but\nit's not an unreasonable long time and\n\n499\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.950\nas a result of that somebody may be\nable to work at that problem for\n\n500\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:25:00.170\nfive years and\ncontinuously generate new technology and\n\n501\n00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.770\nbring it online to continue\nto chip away at that.\n\n502\n00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:05.690\nAnd as a result of that it may take\nthem five or six or seven years but\n\n503\n00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:06.850\nthey may get the key.\n\n504\n00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.740\nIf they get the key that data may\nstill be valuable to them within\n\n505\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.830\na five to seven year span and\nthat could be a challenge.\n\n506\n00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:17.735\nIf we weren't aware of that, if we weren't\ndecrypting our data, examining it and\n\n507\n00:25:17.735 --> 00:25:22.220\nre-encrypting it every year to ensure that\nthe most accurate, most beneficial and\n\n508\n00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.460\nthe longest lived or\n\n509\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.400\nlongest lived protections are being\napplied, we may run into a problem.\n\n510\n00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.460\nWe may have to change that AES\n128 bit encryption implementation\n\n511\n00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:35.880\nto an AES 256 bit encryption or\na 192 bit, to 256, or\n\n512\n00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:41.240\nwhatever to double, triple or even further\nextend out the protection offered, so that\n\n513\n00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:45.360\nover the lifetime of that retention period\nwe actually are protecting the data.\n\n514\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.280\nThis requires continuous assessment and\ncontinuous reevaluation on\n\n515\n00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.840\nthe part of the CCSP or whoever is doing\nthe risk assessment of the protection.\n\n516\n00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.880\nAnd we as CCSPs have to think about and\nunderstand this, it's very,\n\n517\n00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.300\nvery important, right?\n\n518\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.680\nIf we don't know that and\nwe're acting on the assumption,\n\n519\n00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:02.980\nlike Daniel may have when we\nstarted the conversation.\n\n520\n00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.810\nHey, I was told it would be good for\n100,000 years so I'm not gonna worry about\n\n521\n00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:08.840\nit, I'm just gonna protect it, and\nI can leave it in place, I believe, right?\n\n522\n00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.770\nEssentially what was told me,\nthat may prove to be a challenge.\n\n523\n00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:14.230\nWe may have to challenge those\nassumptions in order to really understand\n\n524\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.210\nhow to set data protection up properly,\nand\n\n525\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.910\nto propagate that protection\nwell into the future.\n\n526\n00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.374\nAnd so retention periods can be tricky not\nbecause we have to worry about what to\n\n527\n00:26:22.374 --> 00:26:25.730\ndo with data for 50 years we put it in a\ndark hole bury it and just put a guard in\n\n528\n00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.638\nfront of it that's pretty obvious and\npretty straight forward.\n\n529\n00:26:28.638 --> 00:26:32.697\nBut it's what we have to do to protect the\ndata in terms of the safe guards we apply\n\n530\n00:26:32.697 --> 00:26:36.819\nother than the guards, the guns and the\ngates right, the actual electronic safe\n\n531\n00:26:36.819 --> 00:26:40.600\nguards that we put in place,\nencryption and things of that nature.\n\n532\n00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.420\nMay have to be updated indeed regularly\nshould be vetted and tested and\n\n533\n00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.340\nvalidated against industry\nassumptions about the length and\n\n534\n00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.930\nthe veracity of that protection.\n\n535\n00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:50.500\nIt's very important for us to consider.\n\n536\n00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.980\n>> It seems like a huge topic\nto be honest with you the fact\n\n537\n00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.830\nthat data today I might\nthink is completely nothing.\n\n538\n00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.570\nIt's just random data that we\nmight have on our systems.\n\n539\n00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.000\nAnd it might have little\nbits of information here,\n\n540\n00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.100\nlittle bits of information there but\nit's not really that big of a deal.\n\n541\n00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:09.180\nTen years from now it might be a huge\ndeal, I don't know anything about that.\n\n542\n00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.946\nThat's why we're constantly re-evaluating,\n\n543\n00:27:11.946 --> 00:27:15.000\nis that data is something\nthat I need to reclassify.\n\n544\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.190\nDo I need to up the level\nof importance and therefore\n\n545\n00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:22.240\nmaybe I need to strengthen my safeguards\naround it to make it more protected.\n\n546\n00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:26.580\nThat's what we're talking about here\nis making sure that we're constantly\n\n547\n00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:31.640\nevaluating and re-evaluating, therefore\nif re-classification needs to be done,\n\n548\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.260\nwe're doing so and\nthen adding extra security as protections.\n\n549\n00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:39.510\n>> Very, very true and you have to,\njust kinda wrapping this discussion up,\n\n550\n00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:42.460\nputting a nice little bow on it,\nbased on what you just described.\n\n551\n00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.130\nYou remember that as a CCSP and\n\n552\n00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.910\ngenerically as just a security\nprofessional, whatever you may be.\n\n553\n00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.300\nWhether you're certified as a CCSP,\nyou're a CISSP, whatever you are,\n\n554\n00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.800\nyou're not certified at all you\njust have an interest in security.\n\n555\n00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.380\nWhatever it is right\nremember that we may or\n\n556\n00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.910\nmay not be experts in this\nparticular algorithm.\n\n557\n00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.070\nWe may or may not understand cryptography\nand the implications of the choice of this\n\n558\n00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:07.010\nalgorithm and its implementation, that\nmay not be our area of expertise, right?\n\n559\n00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.640\nYou may or may not know,\nin other words, what this really means.\n\n560\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.100\nYou just may know what you're told and\nyou have to challenge those assumptions.\n\n561\n00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.080\nThis is such a critical point for us as\nsecurity practitioners to understand.\n\n562\n00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.900\nJust because somebody says it's gonna be\ngood doesn't mean it necessarily will.\n\n563\n00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:27.210\nIt may be good in their world, under their\ntight control with their circumstances\n\n564\n00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:30.770\ntightly managed in their\none size fits one solution.\n\n565\n00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.020\nIt may not apply the same way to you.\n\n566\n00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.090\nAnd you have to trust, as we often\ntalk about, right, trust but verify.\n\n567\n00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.270\nWe often also talk about\ninspecting what you expect, right?\n\n568\n00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.610\nSo the idea is that if we\nwant those outcomes to occur,\n\n569\n00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.580\nwe have to take an active\npart in managing them.\n\n570\n00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.460\nAnd remember,\nwe may not be experts in all things.\n\n571\n00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.840\nI've talked about this before.\n\n572\n00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.140\nKnowing your limitations,\nand understanding where and\n\n573\n00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.040\nwhen to ask for\nhelp is crucial to being successful\n\n574\n00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:57.650\nin this security game that we all attempt\nto play, whether it's in the cloud or not.\n\n575\n00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:02.200\nAnd we have to go out and seek the expert\nadvice, and the expert implementation\n\n576\n00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:07.520\nguidance either from industry or from\nindustry practitioners or from vendors,\n\n577\n00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:11.260\nsome combination of those people and\nthose entities that understand and\n\n578\n00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.950\ncan help us interpret the technology to\nmake sure we're applying it correctly.\n\n579\n00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.730\nI do a lot of work with cryptograph\nalgorithms but I'm not an expert\n\n580\n00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:23.320\non how long it takes to break them because\nI'm not up on the latest technology trends\n\n581\n00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:27.550\nabout powerful, processing cycles are and\nhow quickly they grow.\n\n582\n00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.380\nI know on average Moore's\nlaw under a year now but\n\n583\n00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.190\nI don't know the exact number of days or\nmonths it takes.\n\n584\n00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.870\nI'd have to really go find\nsomebody as a mathematician or\n\n585\n00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.645\nan expert in these systems who could say,\nyeah if you bought the latest technology,\n\n586\n00:29:39.645 --> 00:29:44.145\nevery nine months without fail, built in\narray, constantly updated it, in best case\n\n587\n00:29:44.145 --> 00:29:47.865\nscenario would take this long if you did\nthis algorithm implemented this way.\n\n588\n00:29:47.865 --> 00:29:50.865\nI could give you a rough estimate but\nI'm not gonna be the expert on that.\n\n589\n00:29:50.865 --> 00:29:54.865\nI gotta go find the mathematicians or the\ncryptographers that would be in the system\n\n590\n00:29:54.865 --> 00:29:57.215\narchitects and\nthe system engineers that would be and\n\n591\n00:29:57.215 --> 00:30:00.780\nI can, if I need to figure out how\nto bring them into a conversation.\n\n592\n00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.320\nBut I can tell you on average,\nthat if you use this kind of algorithm,\n\n593\n00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:08.340\nimplemented this way, that it will afford\ngenerally, this level of protection for\n\n594\n00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.730\nthis amount or\nthis duration of retention period.\n\n595\n00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:12.120\nI can give you that guidance.\n\n596\n00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.830\nBut specifically, I'm not the person\nyou want making that final decision.\n\n597\n00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.420\nBut I'm also the person that will tell you\nthat I'm not the person you want, right?\n\n598\n00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:23.080\nSo we've gotta understand our limitations\nand also understand what we're good at.\n\n599\n00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:26.190\nAnd then as a result of that make\neducated decisions, very, very important.\n\n600\n00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:30.020\n>> Adam, I think you pointed out the over\narching theme here is you have to learn to\n\n601\n00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.358\nthink critically when it\ncomes to your system.\n\n602\n00:30:32.358 --> 00:30:35.503\nYou have to come at it from a logical\nperspective and say just because someone\n\n603\n00:30:35.503 --> 00:30:38.770\ntold me something doesn't mean\nthat that's what I'm gonna get.\n\n604\n00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.280\nIn my generally be true and that's what\nwe deal with a lot, is a lot of in\n\n605\n00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.730\ngeneralizations and axioms that we tend\nto base all of our assumptions on.\n\n606\n00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:49.160\nAnd then,\nthat's a great way to live our life.\n\n607\n00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.570\nWe need that, otherwise we would\nhave to be experts on everything.\n\n608\n00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.920\nIt wouldn't be possible\nto get through the day,\n\n609\n00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.010\nhardly, without having\nto challenge everything.\n\n610\n00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.395\nBut when it comes to data we do\nneed to try and take a little more\n\n611\n00:31:01.395 --> 00:31:05.385\nfocused approach to it especially when\nit comes to classifying whether or\n\n612\n00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:09.185\nnot this is sensitive does it need more or\nless security.\n\n613\n00:31:09.185 --> 00:31:15.105\nHow do I need to deal with that\ndata from a security perspective.\n\n614\n00:31:15.105 --> 00:31:18.765\nAdam you did a great job on explaining\nthat very concept to us and\n\n615\n00:31:18.765 --> 00:31:23.330\nthe challenges and things that we're gonna\nface and trying to accomplish that goal.\n\n616\n00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.918\nNow we do thank you for stopping by and\ndoing that for us today.\n\n617\n00:31:25.918 --> 00:31:28.899\nI'm looking at that clock and\nboy she ticks back very, very quickly and\n\n618\n00:31:28.899 --> 00:31:32.138\nwe are at the end of another great episode\nhopefully you guys have enjoyed it.\n\n619\n00:31:32.138 --> 00:31:34.090\nWe're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for

or\n\n5\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.960\ncertified cloud security professional\nseries, if I can get that correctly, and\n\n6\n00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.120\njoining us in the studio today is the man,\nthe myth, the legend, that is Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.319\nAdam, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.831\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:33.620\n>> Good, good, good.\n\n10\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.060\nI am, well, I am.\n\n11\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.680\nI just am.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n12\n00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.120\n>> That's how it is.\n\n13\n00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.680\nIt is what it is, I am what I am,\nand as Popeye said, let's get going.\n\n14\n00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.960\nSo let's talk some more about\ncloud-related security concerns.\n\n15\n00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.370\nYou have to make light of\nthe inanity of life, sometimes,\n\n16\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.360\nin order to get through it.\n\n17\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.900\nAnd so when we think about data and cloud\nsecurity, and how it all comes together,\n\n18\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.830\nwe were talking about in our last episode\nthe need to understand the relevancy of\n\n19\n00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.640\nthe protection, and the longevity, or the\nlength of the protection that we provide.\n\n20\n00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.850\nSo, just a real world conversation\nexample that harkens back to this for\n\n21\n00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.400\njust a moment.\n\n22\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.123\nSo a lot of times, we'll protect things,\nand in the old way of doing things,\n\n23\n00:01:10.123 --> 00:01:13.843\nyou'd lock something in a drawer, put\nit in a file cabinet, put it in a safe,\n\n24\n00:01:13.843 --> 00:01:14.728\nwhatever it was.\n\n25\n00:01:14.728 --> 00:01:16.496\nAnd a lot of times,\nyou may remember it's there and\n\n26\n00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:17.698\nit would sit there for a long time.\n\n27\n00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:20.096\nA lot of times you forget it's there and\nmay not realize, and\n\n28\n00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:21.470\nthen you trip over it years later.\n\n29\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.911\nWe've probably all had this happen to us.\n\n30\n00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:26.485\nWe put something away in a box, or\nput something in a drawer somewhere, and\n\n31\n00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:29.370\nremembering or\nthinking we'll remember it's there.\n\n32\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.010\nYears later, we unpack, or\ndo something, or trip across it and\n\n33\n00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.970\ngo wow, look at that, I didn't realize\nthat I looked that way when I was\n\n34\n00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.878\nback doing this or that, or\nI had this or that particular thing.\n\n35\n00:01:40.878 --> 00:01:45.540\nAnd so I was doing some unpacking\nof just some boxes, moving\n\n36\n00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.140\nstuff around before I came up to spend the\nweek with you guys here this week and talk\n\n37\n00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.000\nabout cloud, and I've got a garage full\nof boxes, probably everybody in the world\n\n38\n00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.800\ndoes that owns a house, because what\nelse do you put in a garage but boxes?\n\n39\n00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.620\nThat's what it's built for.\n\n40\n00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.340\nIt's a big box where\nyou put smaller boxes.\n\n41\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.954\nThat's the whole storage concept.\n\n42\n00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:03.165\nAnd so I was looking for\nsomething in particular,\n\n43\n00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:06.688\nactually a book that I had promised to\ngive to one of my student's on something,\n\n44\n00:02:06.688 --> 00:02:10.053\nso I went out and I was digging through\nsome boxes, and I found a whole bunch of\n\n45\n00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:13.312\nstuff that I had put it away years ago\nwhen we were moving from place to place\n\n46\n00:02:13.312 --> 00:02:16.298\nbefore we settled down, and\nultimately wound up where we are now.\n\n47\n00:02:16.298 --> 00:02:20.895\nAnd among all the things that I found\nwas a lot of my old certifications.\n\n48\n00:02:20.895 --> 00:02:23.335\nAs many people do, you get them and\nyou're proud of them.\n\n49\n00:02:23.335 --> 00:02:25.995\nYou want to put them up, but you don't\nalways put them up on the wall, and\n\n50\n00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:28.645\nwhen you get a whole bunch, you want\nto just put them away in a folder or\n\n51\n00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:31.465\nin a box somewhere, and say, yeah,\nI have that, and put it on a resume, and\n\n52\n00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:32.955\nyou don't even bother to put it up.\n\n53\n00:02:32.955 --> 00:02:35.420\nAnd so I have a duffel bag that,\nover the years,\n\n54\n00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.010\nI've just put all these certificates into\nas I gather various certifications and\n\n55\n00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.350\nget the welcome kit or\nwhatever from the vendor.\n\n56\n00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.640\nAnd so I just stick them in there so\nI know where they are.\n\n57\n00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.150\nSo my VMware certifications,\nMicrosoft, everything's in there.\n\n58\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.700\nSo I found some of my original Microsoft\ncertifications from when I first\n\n59\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.220\nstarted getting certified, when Microsoft\nfirst started offering certifications.\n\n60\n00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.564\nSo I've been certified probably since\nthe mid 90s, approximately, with them,\n\n61\n00:03:00.564 --> 00:03:01.920\nmid to late 90s.\n\n62\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.181\nAnd so going all the way back to DOS,\nand certainly Windows 95,\n\n63\n00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:11.784\nand some of the original MCP\ncertifications that I took.\n\n64\n00:03:11.784 --> 00:03:15.090\nAnd back then they gave you wallet cards,\nand so did CompTIA.\n\n65\n00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.530\nThey still do for, I think,\nprobably a lot of their stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.040\nBut I've been A+ certified since A+\nfirst came out for instance, right?\n\n67\n00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.183\nAnd so I have one that goes back probably,\nagain, to I don't know, the mid-90s or\n\n68\n00:03:25.183 --> 00:03:25.939\nsomething for A+.\n\n69\n00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.880\nWhatever it would've been, early 90s.\n\n70\n00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.410\nAnd so I found my original certificates\nand wallet cards and all that stuff.\n\n71\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.330\nAnd they used to also give\nyou pins at a certain point.\n\n72\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.247\nAnd so they would send you these\nlittle lapel pins for MCP, MCT, and\n\n73\n00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:41.809\njust all this stuff, and so I just found\nall this stuff sitting in a bag in a box.\n\n74\n00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.847\nAnd I said wow, that's kind cool and\nthen I promptly put it back, put it away,\n\n75\n00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:47.254\nand I probably won't look at it again for\nanother 20 years.\n\n76\n00:03:47.254 --> 00:03:48.519\nBut my point was really not so\n\n77\n00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.051\nmuch hey, you find all this\nrandom stuff laying around,\n\n78\n00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:54.620\nbut think about the random data that we\nhave laying around in the cloud as users.\n\n79\n00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.110\nThink about all the stuff that we put\nin Dropbox, that we put in SkyDrive,\n\n80\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.060\nthat we put out there on corporate shares\nin file systems, and then over time,\n\n81\n00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.880\nwe just forget about it.\n\n82\n00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.110\nWe call this abandoned orphaned data,\ntraditionally, and we have so\n\n83\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.210\nmuch of it laying out there that\nas cloud security professionals,\n\n84\n00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.200\nit may be very hard for us sometimes\nto understand the value of data\n\n85\n00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.120\ncuz we're talking extensively about\nclassification in the last episode.\n\n86\n00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.435\nAnd this really rolls forward into\nwhat we're doing now with regards to\n\n87\n00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:24.495\nunderstanding how to build\nrelevant protections, and\n\n88\n00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:29.045\nalso classify data, rolling that forward\nto protect data the appropriate way and\n\n89\n00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:30.435\nat the appropriate level, right?\n\n90\n00:04:30.435 --> 00:04:34.055\nBy really thinking about how to design and\nimplement the relevant protections,\n\n91\n00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:37.575\nand associate or allying with\nthe appropriate relevant jurisdiction or\n\n92\n00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:41.425\nrequirements from a compliance\nperspective to be able to protect data.\n\n93\n00:04:41.425 --> 00:04:44.085\nIt may be okay for me to leave all\nmy stuff in a garage, in a box, and\n\n94\n00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:46.270\nnever look at it, but\nin the corporate world,\n\n95\n00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.110\nI may not be able to just put stuff\nin a box and forget about it.\n\n96\n00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.520\nI may have to account for\nit, inventory it, and\n\n97\n00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.060\nmake sure that I'm carrying it forward as\na risk assessment, as part of an audit.\n\n98\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.740\nAnd so it's very important for\nme as a cloud security professional\n\n99\n00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.550\nto really understand what kind of\ndata my organization maintains, and\n\n100\n00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.610\nwhat kind of data is\nin our data inventory.\n\n101\n00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.850\nAnd that brings up an interesting point\nwhich is do you as a cloud professional,\n\n102\n00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.570\ndo you as a security professional,\nas an IT professional,\n\n103\n00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.020\ndo you have in your company a policy\nthat says you will do a data inventory,\n\n104\n00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.460\nand you will have a complete record and\nunderstanding of the data that your\n\n105\n00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.170\norganization is responsible for and that\nyou are suppose to find protections for?\n\n106\n00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.490\nWe may or\nmay not have such a beast, right?\n\n107\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.640\nIt may not exist,\nexcept perhaps in theory or on paper.\n\n108\n00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.640\nYet it's very important, it's critical,\nto be able to understand this information,\n\n109\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.100\nhave a perspective on it, and\nbe able to figure out how to\n\n110\n00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.290\napply this concept to\nthe holistic management of data.\n\n111\n00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.650\nData itself, in other words,\nis a resource, and it has value.\n\n112\n00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.140\nAnd if we don't inventory it like we do\nanything else, we can't extract, manage,\n\n113\n00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.850\nand understand the full value,\nbut also the full risk\n\n114\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.970\nassociated with owning that data and\ntrying to consume that value.\n\n115\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.710\nIt's very, very important for\nus to think about.\n\n116\n00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.470\nWe keep accurate records\nof our bank statements and\n\n117\n00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.870\nour balance in our bank accounts so\nwe don't overdraw.\n\n118\n00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.060\nWe should, in the same respect, keep\naccurate records of the value of our data,\n\n119\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.280\nand understand how to manage that data so\nthat we don't, through\n\n120\n00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.910\nunnecessary actions, expose the data\nwithout the proper level of protection.\n\n121\n00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.950\nSo data privacy acts and awareness of them\nbecomes important because there are laws\n\n122\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.560\nthat speak to data privacy in\nvarious parts of the world.\n\n123\n00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.000\nAnd as security professionals, it would be\nincumbent on us to be aware of them and to\n\n124\n00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.110\nbe on the right side of the conversation\nwith regards to application of them.\n\n125\n00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.220\nSo what information in the cloud is\nregulated under what data protection laws,\n\n126\n00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.830\nand through what jurisdictions\nwould be important for us to know.\n\n127\n00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.360\nWhose laws apply in a dispute?\n\n128\n00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.940\nWhere is personal data\nprocessed versus where is it\n\n129\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.747\nmanaged versus where is it stored?\n\n130\n00:06:36.747 --> 00:06:40.348\nThese are all very important things\nthat we would have to think about and\n\n131\n00:06:40.348 --> 00:06:41.015\nbe aware of.\n\n132\n00:06:41.015 --> 00:06:42.216\nVery, very important for\n\n133\n00:06:42.216 --> 00:06:45.494\nus to consider as cloud security\nprofessionals who's responsible for\n\n134\n00:06:45.494 --> 00:06:49.800\npersonal data, PII, personal identifiable\ninformation, maintained in the cloud.\n\n135\n00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.857\nIs it the customer?\n\n136\n00:06:50.857 --> 00:06:52.248\nIs it the cloud provider?\n\n137\n00:06:52.248 --> 00:06:54.029\nIs it the security professional?\n\n138\n00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.919\nIs it all three?\n\n139\n00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:58.150\nIs it a fourth party we haven't named and\nidentified?\n\n140\n00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.870\nThese are contentious issues that we have\nto really understand and be aware of.\n\n141\n00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.230\nThe differences between jurisdiction and\napplicable law is also important, right?\n\n142\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.980\nSo, applicable law versus\njurisdictional law.\n\n143\n00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.250\nI'm gonna impose on Daniel here for\na second and see if he can help us out.\n\n144\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.960\nDo you know the difference between\napplicable law and jurisdictional law?\n\n145\n00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.400\n>> I would assume that whatever\napplies to you at that point in time,\n\n146\n00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.170\nwherever you're at,\nis the applicable law, and\n\n147\n00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:28.710\njurisdictional might not apply to me\nif I'm not inside of this certain zone.\n\n148\n00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.410\n>> So, essentially correct, absolutely.\n\n149\n00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:34.675\nSo applicable law is essentially the law\nthat is applied to a certain matter.\n\n150\n00:07:34.675 --> 00:07:38.422\nSo if I have to decide whether or not\nrunning a red light equaled me crashing\n\n151\n00:07:38.422 --> 00:07:41.927\na car and causing injury,\napplicable law based on the traffic laws,\n\n152\n00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:46.098\nthe fact that you're normally supposed to\nstop at a red light, not go through it,\n\n153\n00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:49.740\nwould indicate that the law says\nprobably I'm at fault, most likely.\n\n154\n00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.262\nJurisdictional law is the law or\nthe interpretational law that's used for\n\n155\n00:07:54.262 --> 00:07:58.999\na nation state to identify and figure out\nwhether a national court has rights to\n\n156\n00:07:58.999 --> 00:08:01.172\nhear a case or, indeed, can rule.\n\n157\n00:08:01.172 --> 00:08:04.828\nOn an issue of law in certain trials or\ncertain circumstances.\n\n158\n00:08:04.828 --> 00:08:08.430\nSo if data, as we talked about,\nis highly mobile in the cloud.\n\n159\n00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.850\nAnd data is moved through\nseveral jurisdictions,\n\n160\n00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.040\nthere may be a question of jurisdictional\nlaw in order to figure out who\n\n161\n00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.290\nhas the rights to rule on whether\nthat data is legal in that country.\n\n162\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.960\nAnd then the applicable law that's\ngonna be used to decide that case\n\n163\n00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.250\nis distilled down essentially\nfrom jurisdiction.\n\n164\n00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.950\nSo if countries a, b, and c are all\nfighting over the right to try somebody,\n\n165\n00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:32.370\njurisdiction has to be established before\nthe applicable law of the country that\n\n166\n00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.260\nwins can be essentially\nused to decide the case.\n\n167\n00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.430\n>> It's an interesting concept,\nbecause if you think about it,\n\n168\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:41.530\nyou're completely, no maliciousness\ninvolved, you're just moving data.\n\n169\n00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.630\nAnd it happens to cross\na certain boundary, and\n\n170\n00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.870\nall of a sudden you're a criminal, just\nbecause of that specific type of data.\n\n171\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.620\nThey have a law against it and\nyou moved into their territory,\n\n172\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.640\nyou have now violated that law and\nthat's something you gotta look out for.\n\n173\n00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.389\nYou have to be aware of\nit at the very least, so\n\n174\n00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:01.366\nthat you can make a caveat for that.\n\n175\n00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:02.780\n>> It's very true and so\n\n176\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.136\nI've talked extensively in prior episodes\nabout the need for CCSPs to be aware.\n\n177\n00:09:08.136 --> 00:09:12.249\nWe talk about operational awareness or\na situational awareness in the military,\n\n178\n00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:15.228\nyou often hear people in\nthe military refer to this when they\n\n179\n00:09:15.228 --> 00:09:19.240\nare operationally engaging in\nactivities fighting battles, whatever.\n\n180\n00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.930\nYou have to have this\n360 degree kind of radar\n\n181\n00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.000\noperating around you to know what's\ngoing on at all times, right?\n\n182\n00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.950\nAnd it's the same idea here, right?\n\n183\n00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:31.120\nSecurity professionals have to be aware\nof all the environmental concerns,\n\n184\n00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.860\nthe jurisdictional concerns,\nthe geographic concerns,\n\n185\n00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.120\nwhatever they may be that may\nimpact our ability to do our job.\n\n186\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.010\nAnd because data is highly portable in the\ncloud, we have to understand that data may\n\n187\n00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.590\nexist in multiple places and\nmay move through multiple places.\n\n188\n00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.390\nAnd knowledge of the jurisdictional\nelements involved\n\n189\n00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.270\nin exiting in those places\nis crucial to our success.\n\n190\n00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.485\nThere's no doubt about it, right?\n\n191\n00:09:51.485 --> 00:09:53.877\n[LAUGH] So we have to be aware of that.\n\n192\n00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:54.901\nSo I see that Mr.\n\n193\n00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:59.947\nBeam has finally joined us here in studio\ntwo, and is inquiring as to my footwear,\n\n194\n00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:04.279\nwhich is usually a constant subject\nof discussion in many of my shows.\n\n195\n00:10:04.279 --> 00:10:07.583\nSo David, I've chosen to go with\na polka dotted theme this week, I\n\n196\n00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:11.805\nknow it's very hard to see we're in studio\ntwo this week and I'm gonna hold them up.\n\n197\n00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:13.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe it's gonna help us for\n\n198\n00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.800\nthe wild shot and\nI'm hopefully not to fall over.\n\n199\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.360\nBut I've got a green sock\nwith blue polka dots on.\n\n200\n00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.580\n>> Cuz of the Easter egg in this episode.\n\n201\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.965\n>> This is the Easter egg in this episode,\nyou'll see them there.\n\n202\n00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:25.190\nBut I actually am doing\na polka dotted theme all week.\n\n203\n00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.000\nSo I'll have a different pair of\npolka dotted themed socks every, for\n\n204\n00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.300\nevery episode that we shoot by day.\n\n205\n00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.900\nRather, by all the episodes by day for\na single group episodes.\n\n206\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.640\nSo inquire every day and\nwe will share them with you at some point.\n\n207\n00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.330\nIt's an Easter egg inside\none of the sessions.\n\n208\n00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.610\nBut good to see you and\nglad that you're able to join us.\n\n209\n00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.930\nSo essential requirements, right?\n\n210\n00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.960\nWhen we think about the ability to\nbe able to provide protection, for\n\n211\n00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.230\nprivacy and data protection under the law,\nis really as Dan and\n\n212\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.270\nRobert we're just talking about,\nit's really open for interpretation.\n\n213\n00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:59.234\nIn the sense that national boundaries,\nand you know you said, I crossed a line,\n\n214\n00:10:59.234 --> 00:11:02.420\na demarkation point of some kind and\nall of a sudden I became a criminal.\n\n215\n00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.850\nIt sounds kind of crazy when you said it,\nI was listening to you and I'm thinking,\n\n216\n00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.660\nthat's so, yeah, it is in one respect so\ncrazy, but yet when you take that out and\n\n217\n00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.840\nextrapolate that into the real world,\nwell, we cross a national boundary,\n\n218\n00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.620\nwhat we common call a border, right?\n\n219\n00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.220\nAnd we cross a border, we know,\nright when we're flying into a country,\n\n220\n00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.440\nwe know when we're driving across a border\nat the frontier through a check point,\n\n221\n00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.360\nright, of some kind?\n\n222\n00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.080\nWhen we cross the ocean to\ngo to another country and\n\n223\n00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.920\nwe get off the boat or we go through\ncustoms, we go through passport control.\n\n224\n00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.958\nWe know, it's a big deal,\nit's a physically imposing presence,\n\n225\n00:11:33.958 --> 00:11:36.428\nthere's armed guards,\nthere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n226\n00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:39.262\nYou know you're moving from one\nprotected area to another and\n\n227\n00:11:39.262 --> 00:11:42.477\nyou know, just logically that there's\nsome sort of change going on,\n\n228\n00:11:42.477 --> 00:11:45.054\nyou can process that,\nbecause it's pretty apparent.\n\n229\n00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:48.527\nBut the reality is in the cloud,\nwhile we are doing the same thing,\n\n230\n00:11:48.527 --> 00:11:50.823\nwe do it so quickly and\nso effortlessly and so\n\n231\n00:11:50.823 --> 00:11:54.960\neasily because there really are not\nthose established border crossings.\n\n232\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.820\nIt's simply the data's transiting across\nthe cable and that cable moves underground\n\n233\n00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:03.490\nbetween nation states or across oceans or\nwherever it goes effortlessly, right.\n\n234\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.090\nAnd so we don't really demarcate the same\nway, and so as a result it may be hard for\n\n235\n00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.230\nus to think through the logic and\napply the same thought process.\n\n236\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.290\nBut the reality is,\nit is indeed the same exact thing.\n\n237\n00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.120\nMoving from one nation state, one boundary\nto another implies a different set,\n\n238\n00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.400\nin theory anyway, may imply a different\nset of legal constraints and requirements.\n\n239\n00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.220\nIt doesn't always, right,\nwe ha geographic associations like the EU,\n\n240\n00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.420\nthe European Union, where there may\nbe a common set of laws in play that\n\n241\n00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.240\nessentially touch all\nthe member states equally.\n\n242\n00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.040\nAnd there may be internal controls\nyou need to a certain country for\n\n243\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.530\ncertain things, but\nbroad laws may apply that and\n\n244\n00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.360\ninterpret that the same\nway in every country.\n\n245\n00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.680\nThere's a mixture and\na combination in a situation like that.\n\n246\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.880\nOr you may have very specific country\noriented laws that are unique to a certain\n\n247\n00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.050\ncountry, right, so we have to think\nabout that, have to be aware of that,\n\n248\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.310\nhave to understand that\nwith regards to privacy.\n\n249\n00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.890\nYou know the idea of personal data\nprotection and PI based protections,\n\n250\n00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:02.110\npersonally identified protections in\nthe cloud is a construct that is still\n\n251\n00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.370\nevolving and is sometimes very\ndifficult to clearly discern.\n\n252\n00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.760\nAs a CCSP we have to become\nknowledgeable in some very archaic and\n\n253\n00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.350\nvery difficult to understand\nlegal constraints,\n\n254\n00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:16.200\nthat may operator apply,\nin certain geographies, but not in others.\n\n255\n00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.050\nAgain, knowing our limits.\n\n256\n00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.270\nRight, understanding where\nwe need to seek help.\n\n257\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.720\nThis is an area where you\nneed to get expert guidance.\n\n258\n00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.620\nThis is, to be very upfront and\ntotally transparent with you.\n\n259\n00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:31.230\nThis is an area where I just do not\nspend a lot of time talking to customers\n\n260\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.220\nin depth about requirements, because I\ndon't specialize in trans-border law and\n\n261\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.740\ndata flows in trans-border situations.\n\n262\n00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.360\nI have, and I know lawyers in practice\nthat do this kind of stuff by country\n\n263\n00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.490\nthat are peers and colleagues that\nI speak to when I have a problem or\n\n264\n00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.610\na question on behalf of a customer.\n\n265\n00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.520\nOr I have a legal department in\na customer's office, right, in their\n\n266\n00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.250\nglobal enterprise that they can go to and\nget expert guidance and opinion on.\n\n267\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.510\nBut this is not something as an individual\nthat I'm equipped to understand and\n\n268\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:03.060\nhandle because I'm not a practicing\nattorney and I don't keep up on the law.\n\n269\n00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.990\nAnd so that's something you really need\nto be aware of and think about, right?\n\n270\n00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.890\nSo when we think about\ncommon privacy terms,\n\n271\n00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.040\nwe do have to define some vocabulary here.\n\n272\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:12.840\nWe have to think about data subject,\n\n273\n00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.860\nhave to think about personal data,\nprocessing controller and processor.\n\n274\n00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.550\nWe have to think about these terms.\n\n275\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.100\nThe data subject is the person or\n\n276\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.970\nthe entity that the data\nis being created about.\n\n277\n00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.710\nThe personal data is of course the PI, the\npersonally identifiable information that\n\n278\n00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:31.540\nis gonna actually be distilled down so\nthings like social security numbers,\n\n279\n00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.230\nbirth dates,\nthese are personal data items, right,\n\n280\n00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:39.190\nthat are gonna be essentially part of\nthe data make up of me as a data subject.\n\n281\n00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.960\nProcessing is the act of interacting\nwith and managing this data.\n\n282\n00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:47.040\nWe have a controller who sets the policies\nfor the data and a processor who\n\n283\n00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.960\nexecutes on those policies and manages\nthe data day to day moments in the system.\n\n284\n00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.390\nThe controller is more of\na management oversight function.\n\n285\n00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.470\nThe processor is more of an operational\ntactical consumption usage and\n\n286\n00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.340\nday to day monitoring function,\na management function rather.\n\n287\n00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.340\nSo we want to just keep in mind and\nunderstand, right, that we differentiate\n\n288\n00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.710\nand we have to understand these roles and\nreally have a sense of what they mean.\n\n289\n00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.060\nSo when we think about privacy, think\nabout data, think about the constraints\n\n290\n00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.770\nand the confluence of these different\nstreams of thought we have to understand\n\n291\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.160\nthat not all data is equally valuable and\nnot all privacy protections are equally\n\n292\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.090\ngoing to offer the same level of\nauthoritative protection in the system.\n\n293\n00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.820\nSome data will be more highly priced then,\ntherefore, typically\n\n294\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.310\nmore tightly protected than others, so\nwe do have to think about that as well.\n\n295\n00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.070\nIt's not always easy to identify,\npersonally identifiable data in the cloud.\n\n296\n00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.380\nIt's not easy to understand what level of\nprotection to afford it, because remember,\n\n297\n00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.227\nwe may not always have visibility into\nall the systems that maintain the data,\n\n298\n00:15:43.227 --> 00:15:47.018\ndepending on the responsibility that\nthe customer versus the cloud provider\n\n299\n00:15:47.018 --> 00:15:48.907\nis going to have in the service model.\n\n300\n00:15:48.907 --> 00:15:52.203\nWe've talked extensively about\nthis with IS, PaaS, and SaaS.\n\n301\n00:15:52.203 --> 00:15:54.740\nThere are different levels\nof responsibility that\n\n302\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.806\nwe can then ascribe for data protection.\n\n303\n00:15:56.806 --> 00:15:58.838\nBecause in the SaaS model, remember,\n\n304\n00:15:58.838 --> 00:16:02.533\nthe data is being managed by the cloud\nprovider, whereas all the we do as\n\n305\n00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:06.270\nthe customer is really focus on\naccess control up front for users.\n\n306\n00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.260\nThe cloud customer, in other words,\nhas very limited rights,\n\n307\n00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:12.540\nlimited responsibilities with regards\nto data security in the SaaS model.\n\n308\n00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.730\nWe do have responsibilities, but\nthey're very narrowly defined, and\n\n309\n00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.010\nwe really have a very limited\ntheater of operations.\n\n310\n00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:24.010\nThe cloud provider is gonna handle 95%\nof all the security related concerns and\n\n311\n00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.570\nthe architecture and the management of\ndata cuz that's really what they do.\n\n312\n00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.560\nWhereas in in IaaS model we as\nthe customer are gonna have a lot more\n\n313\n00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.680\nresponsibility and\na lot more exposure to the systems and\n\n314\n00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:38.260\nthe control of them that are gonna help\nus to understand how to manage data.\n\n315\n00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.940\nSo physical security right,\nis gonna be important and\n\n316\n00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.248\nwe have to be thinking about that.\n\n317\n00:16:42.248 --> 00:16:47.260\nIn the IaaS model in the past\nmodel in the SaaS model, right?\n\n318\n00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.340\nBut who's gonna be in charge of physical\nsecurity may not be an easy question to\n\n319\n00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:55.590\nunderstand because if it's a private\ncloud on prem It is the cloud customer\n\n320\n00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:59.640\nwho essentially is buying from the cloud\nprovider, but it's the same business that\n\n321\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.410\nessentially inhabits both roles that\nis responsible for everything, right?\n\n322\n00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.690\nCuz the business is both the provider and\nthe customer all at once.\n\n323\n00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.180\nBut if it's a off prem solution,\n\n324\n00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.450\nit is the cloud provider that's\nresponsible typically, right, for\n\n325\n00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.770\nthat physical security in the data\ncenter regardless of the model.\n\n326\n00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.100\nBecause regardless of the model,\nthe cloud provider runs the data center.\n\n327\n00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.520\nSo if they let in\nunauthorized individuals, and\n\n328\n00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:25.540\nthey don't lock the cages, and they allow\nthem to roam the floor without guidance,\n\n329\n00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.630\nor without some sort of escort, it's\nthe cloud provider who screwed up, and\n\n330\n00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.250\nscrewed up on the physical security.\n\n331\n00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.970\nSo we have to think about that and\nwe have to understand that, right?\n\n332\n00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.610\nThat it's very, very important.\n\n333\n00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:38.930\nSo dividing up the responsibility becomes\nsomething to consider and to think about.\n\n334\n00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.820\nSo we have to decide on in our minds\n\n335\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.570\nwhat we're try to accomplish\nfrom a privacy perspective.\n\n336\n00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:49.660\nAnd then we have to partner typically with\nthe provider to understand what level of\n\n337\n00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:55.100\ncontrol they're gonna offer and what level\nof provider based controls they're going\n\n338\n00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:58.610\nto expose and which ones they're gonna\nhave and which ones we're gonna be given.\n\n339\n00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:01.840\nRemember we took a look at that top\nten list of questions that Microsoft\n\n340\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.960\noffered answers to for Office 365.\n\n341\n00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.860\nAnd they made it clear,\nthey differentiated between provider\n\n342\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.110\ncontrols and customer controls and that\nthey would allow the customer to enable\n\n343\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.850\ncertain features and functions and the\nprovider would essentially protect others.\n\n344\n00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:18.370\nSo, we have to think about this\nin terms of the controller,\n\n345\n00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.430\nas well as in terms of the processor.\n\n346\n00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.310\nRemember, the controller is\ngonna oversee and manage, and\n\n347\n00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.730\nthe processor is gonna actually manage or\nrather implement the data protections and\n\n348\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:28.880\nactually deal with them day to day.\n\n349\n00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.130\nSo, we have to think about this,\nand think about roles, and\n\n350\n00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.350\nthink about how to do this.\n\n351\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.940\nData discovery solutions are gonna be\nvery important cuz we don't really know\n\n352\n00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.500\nwhat kind of data we have in the system\nuntil we figure out what that looks like,\n\n353\n00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.930\nit's hard to assign and think through\nthe logic of what control elements\n\n354\n00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.800\nwe would want, let alone what\nkind of elements we may need.\n\n355\n00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.960\nSo it's very important for\nus to be aware of that.\n\n356\n00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.710\nClassification of discovered sensitive\ndata, as we said, becomes very important,\n\n357\n00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.190\nso we discover first\nthen we classify second.\n\n358\n00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.290\nSo the scope and purpose of\nthe data needs to be understood.\n\n359\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.460\nThe categories of the personal data\nthat are going to be available to us,\n\n360\n00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.040\nis it social security numbers?\n\n361\n00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.700\nIs it medical information?\n\n362\n00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:06.570\nIs it financial information?\n\n363\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.202\nIs it birthdays?\n\n364\n00:19:08.202 --> 00:19:13.175\nIs it demographic data where we lived,\nhow old we are, your religion, sex,\n\n365\n00:19:13.175 --> 00:19:14.395\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n366\n00:19:14.395 --> 00:19:16.365\nAll that is different categories of data,\n\n367\n00:19:16.365 --> 00:19:19.648\nwe have to understand all that because\nthat data has to be protected with\n\n368\n00:19:19.648 --> 00:19:22.867\ndifferent levels of protection\nbased on the kind of data it is.\n\n369\n00:19:22.867 --> 00:19:27.257\nSocial security numbers have\nto protected equally, right?\n\n370\n00:19:27.257 --> 00:19:29.327\nAlong with all the other kind of data.\n\n371\n00:19:29.327 --> 00:19:34.287\nBut they may be protected more\nforthrightly with better protections than\n\n372\n00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:39.267\ndemographic data about your religion and\n\n373\n00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:42.037\nyour sex and your age,\nfor instance, right?\n\n374\n00:19:42.037 --> 00:19:46.540\nSo whether you're male or female,\nwhether you are Jewish, Muslim,\n\n375\n00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.120\nProtestant, whatever, right?\n\n376\n00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.480\nYour ethnicity and your age is all\nvery important, but at the grand\n\n377\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.230\nscheme of things, nowhere near as\nimportant as your social security number.\n\n378\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:57.285\nNowhere near as important\nas your birthday.\n\n379\n00:19:57.285 --> 00:20:01.015\nNowhere near as important as your mother's\nmaiden name if you think about security\n\n380\n00:20:01.015 --> 00:20:05.845\nidentifiers traditionally that are used to\nrepresent you with regards to credit and\n\n381\n00:20:05.845 --> 00:20:09.152\nwith regards to online access\nto account information.\n\n382\n00:20:09.152 --> 00:20:13.132\nThe things I just said that are really\nimportant would have to be protected with\n\n383\n00:20:13.132 --> 00:20:17.322\nadditional layers of protection,\nadditional risk management in other words,\n\n384\n00:20:17.322 --> 00:20:18.292\nhas to be applied.\n\n385\n00:20:18.292 --> 00:20:22.166\nBecause somebody finding out that you\nare a male versus a female that you\n\n386\n00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:24.696\nidentify as either Jewish or Muslim.\n\n387\n00:20:24.696 --> 00:20:30.176\nOr as a Native American or\nWhite or Hispanic\n\n388\n00:20:30.176 --> 00:20:34.286\nperson is not as important as somebody\nfinding out your social security number,\n\n389\n00:20:34.286 --> 00:20:39.526\nyour date of birth, and let's say whatever\nelse maybe unique identifier about you.\n\n390\n00:20:39.526 --> 00:20:43.316\nThat could be much more catastrophic from\nthe perspective of identity theft right\n\n391\n00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:46.890\nhypothetically, so we really have to\nthink about the categorization of data\n\n392\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.310\nto understand how to protect\nit appropriately and\n\n393\n00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:52.760\nwhich categories of users are gonnas\nbe allowed to access that data.\n\n394\n00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.700\nIs it a healthcare professional that\ngets to see your medical records?\n\n395\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.563\nA good answer is yes, but\nwhich healthcare professional,\n\n396\n00:20:58.563 --> 00:21:00.230\nwhat level of records to they get?\n\n397\n00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:04.970\nA nurse practitioner may get to see\nless information than the doctor.\n\n398\n00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.038\nAnd the doctor may see all\nof the health records, but\n\n399\n00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:11.664\nthe admin assistant at the front\nthat checks you in may only get\n\n400\n00:21:11.664 --> 00:21:16.580\nto see pertinent data about you, your\nname, your phone number, your address.\n\n401\n00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.880\nBut may not actually be able to see any\nmedical data about you in the patient\n\n402\n00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:24.340\nrecord, because that's protected by law,\nand only a healthcare provider\n\n403\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.900\nwho's actually administering care\nto you has rights to see that data,\n\n404\n00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.520\nunless you specifically sign away that\nprotection and allow them to see it.\n\n405\n00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.060\nSo there may be different\ngrades of data availability,\n\n406\n00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.060\nbased on user categorization.\n\n407\n00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.230\nThis is also very important for\nus to think about and to be aware of.\n\n408\n00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.440\n>> Adam would you say that it could\nbe a problem potentially if it\n\n409\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.650\nhasn't already been?\n\n410\n00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.410\nSomething to the effect of we have\nHIPAA compliance obviously one of our\n\n411\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.520\nbiggest things that we talk about when\nit comes to compliance or legalities and\n\n412\n00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.060\nstandards is that medical reference right?\n\n413\n00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.320\nOur medical data is very\nsensitive to us as a people so\n\n414\n00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.370\nwe take great pains to keep it secure but\n\n415\n00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:05.900\nif it crosses a line if goes into say\nyou've got that data in the cloud and\n\n416\n00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:10.830\nthey say that people like Azure and\nAWS that we are fully HIPAA compliant.\n\n417\n00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:15.440\nI put my data there and it somehow crosses\na border and they confiscate that at that\n\n418\n00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.880\nborder are they able then to\nextrapolate that data and\n\n419\n00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.530\nthen use it, or get a hold of it in some\nway, do we have to worry about that?\n\n420\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.860\n>> So, let's define a couple of terms and\nlet's talk about a couple of scenarios.\n\n421\n00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.370\nFirst of all, you talked about they.\n\n422\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.380\nSo let's make sure we agree on\nwho they is in that example.\n\n423\n00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.010\nThey would be either a third party\njurisdictional entity such as another\n\n424\n00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.880\nnation state, to speak English and\nnot speaking, kind of securities.\n\n425\n00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.600\nSo a third party jurisdictional\nentity is typically a nation state,\n\n426\n00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.690\nright in that example.\n\n427\n00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.425\nOr a bad actor or\na combination of those things, right?\n\n428\n00:22:47.425 --> 00:22:51.035\nSo to be fully HIPAA compliant,\nthat data would actually not leave\n\n429\n00:22:51.035 --> 00:22:53.615\nthe jurisdictional boundary\nof the United States.\n\n430\n00:22:53.615 --> 00:22:58.705\nLet say in an on cryptic form that would\nbe exposed hypothetically in transit\n\n431\n00:22:58.705 --> 00:23:02.125\nto a third party to a nation,\nstate, or instance somewhere.\n\n432\n00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:05.400\nSo you ask, well could someone\nextrapolate could they get it.\n\n433\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.960\nIn theory any thing can happen right?\n\n434\n00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.230\nI mean we know just based n the fact\nthat things are what they are that\n\n435\n00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.490\ndespite our best efforts to protect\ndata it's compromised all the time.\n\n436\n00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:14.610\nSo there's no guarantees.\n\n437\n00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.420\nFirst thing we wake up\nwith every morning and\n\n438\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:20.480\nrealize as security partitioners I get\nout of my bed and do my best, right?\n\n439\n00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.190\nAnd my best may or\nmay not be good enough on any given day.\n\n440\n00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:27.730\nSo there's always the possibility, but\nthe reality is that if that provider\n\n441\n00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.670\nwas smart, that provider really was trying\nto be compliant with HIPAA, high tech, and\n\n442\n00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:35.820\nnot just the letter of the law,\nbut the spirit of the law.\n\n443\n00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.401\nThat data would never the jurisdictional\nboundary of the United States\n\n444\n00:23:40.401 --> 00:23:44.596\nunless it was protected, and\nin such a way was deemed to be safe and\n\n445\n00:23:44.596 --> 00:23:49.046\ntherefore safeguarded at the level\nthat HIPAA affords protection.\n\n446\n00:23:49.046 --> 00:23:52.737\nNow, there are extenuating circumstances.\n\n447\n00:23:52.737 --> 00:23:57.645\nSo for instance, if the cloud provider\nis an IT shop internal to the business\n\n448\n00:23:57.645 --> 00:24:03.220\ndoing on-prem private cloud that they\nessentially are providing themselves.\n\n449\n00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:07.480\nWe're not talking about a managed third\nparty provider like a Microsoft Azure or\n\n450\n00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:12.250\nan Amazon AWS solution, but rather we're\ntalking about home grown cloud, right?\n\n451\n00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.220\nEssentially what we talk about that, If\nwe're talking about a scenario like that,\n\n452\n00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:18.950\nand let's say ABC,\nAcme Record Company, right,\n\n453\n00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:21.420\nis providing their own\nprivate cloud services.\n\n454\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.020\nAnd they decide that they're gonna\nfail their private cloud on-prem over\n\n455\n00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.480\nonto a third party provider to\nfail into the cloud for BCVR,\n\n456\n00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.170\nwhich in theory can happen.\n\n457\n00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.190\nWe haven't talked about but we will\nin upcoming shows talk about disaster\n\n458\n00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.860\nrecovery in the cloud and we could fail\ninto the cloud, fail through the cloud, or\n\n459\n00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.290\nfail out of the cloud potentially.\n\n460\n00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.580\nThere's different ways to deal with this.\n\n461\n00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.820\nSo let's assume for\na minute we're failing into the cloud.\n\n462\n00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.080\nIf we fail into the cloud and\nwe don't do a good job,\n\n463\n00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:52.190\ndon't do our as ABC, Acme Record Corp,\ndo our due diligence to exercise due care.\n\n464\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.740\nAnd we choose to host that data in a DR or\nBCDR event with a provider\n\n465\n00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.970\nthat may move that data cuz we have not\nspecified geographical preference or\n\n466\n00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.860\ngeo hosting options.\n\n467\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:05.970\nWe may violate HIPAA without either\nknowing or realizing we've done so and we\n\n468\n00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:11.090\nmay expose that data and maybe financially\nand legally liable and we may go to jail.\n\n469\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:15.320\nNot just get fined but under HIPAA, we may\nactually potentially could go to jail if\n\n470\n00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:20.070\nthat is significant enough, and certainly\npay a very hefty fine if that is the case.\n\n471\n00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.880\nSo we have to be very\ncareful about that and\n\n472\n00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.948\nbe really aware of the fact that\nwe do bear responsibility here.\n\n473\n00:25:26.948 --> 00:25:29.480\nCertainly in Sarbanes-Oxley as well,\nin SarbOx,\n\n474\n00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.370\ndepending on the kind of issues and\nconcerns that occur.\n\n475\n00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.030\nThere are financial penalties, but there\nare also are legal penalties, jail time,\n\n476\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:42.700\nthat can be imposed if you violate certain\nparts of the law, and are not clear in\n\n477\n00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.110\nproviding clear evidence and\ncertainly doing the things you need to do.\n\n478\n00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.990\nFrom a due diligence and due care\nperspective, with regards to governance,\n\n479\n00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.510\nand risk, and compliance management\nto be aligned under the law.\n\n480\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:58.920\nYou, the senior management of the company\nmay ultimately go to jail and\n\n481\n00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.810\nnot just pay financial\npenalties in certain cases.\n\n482\n00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:04.140\nSo it really does come down\nto how we interpret things.\n\n483\n00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.430\nThere may or\nmay not have been a will implied there.\n\n484\n00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:09.150\nYou may have done it out of ignorance\nas opposed to purposely trying to\n\n485\n00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:09.940\nflout the law.\n\n486\n00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.240\nThere may be mitigating circumstances, is\nmy point, right, to answer the question.\n\n487\n00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.660\nIf you did it without realizing\nthat you were doing it,\n\n488\n00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.570\ncuz the cloud provider was\nnot transparent with you,\n\n489\n00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:22.170\nyou asked the appropriate questions, you\nsaid to them, are you gonna move my data?\n\n490\n00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.420\nThey lie to you and say no,\nand they do it anyway.\n\n491\n00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.170\nThere are mitigating circumstances\nthat may essentially\n\n492\n00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:32.460\ntake the blame away from you and\nplace it somewhere else in that situation.\n\n493\n00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:36.400\nWhere although you may be culpable\nyou may not ultimately be held liable\n\n494\n00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.370\nbecause you did the right thing\neven though the outcome was wrong.\n\n495\n00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.190\nAnd so there's all these possibilities,\nright?\n\n496\n00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.330\nThat can occur, but at the end of the day,\nthe law's black and white, right?\n\n497\n00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.640\nAnd where it is black and white,\nand we don't entertain any gray,\n\n498\n00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.750\nsomebody is gonna pay, the question\nis who, and under what circumstances?\n\n499\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:56.150\nSo we do have to think about\nthe fact that ultimately,\n\n500\n00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:59.540\nsomebody is gonna be responsible,\nsomebody broke the law.\n\n501\n00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:03.210\nSome entity made a decision that was\nincorrect, and whether it was done out of\n\n502\n00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.510\nignorance whether it's done on\npurpose with or without malphemisms,\n\n503\n00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.240\nwith our without thought processes\naround due care and due diligence.\n\n504\n00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.470\nSomebody still ultimately was not aware of\nthe things they have to do and do well.\n\n505\n00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.180\nAnd ignorance as they often say,\nis no excuse before the bar.\n\n506\n00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.990\nMeaning you can't plead ignorance\nas a defense for violating the law.\n\n507\n00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:25.650\nI mean you can but unfortunately it's just\nnot seems in acceptable in defense today.\n\n508\n00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:28.340\nSo we have to take responsibility for\nthose things sometimes,\n\n509\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.450\neven though they may or may not have\nbeen of our direct choosing, and\n\n510\n00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.660\nour thought process around doing them\nmay or may not have been correct.\n\n511\n00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.580\nSo we really have to think about how\nwe classify data, what that means, and\n\n512\n00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.470\nultimately, the steps we take to\nthe point that Daniel was making.\n\n513\n00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.089\nSo we do wanna make sure\nwe're aware of this.\n\n514\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.050\nKey privacy, cloud factors,\nthings we think about,\n\n515\n00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:49.340\nthe laws in the countries we talked about.\n\n516\n00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.510\nWhere the controller and, or\nthe customer is gonna establish and\n\n517\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.450\nmaintain control of that data\nis gonna be really important.\n\n518\n00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.830\nThat's the applicable law that we've\ntalked about under jurisdiction.\n\n519\n00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.490\nWhen we think about the customer and\nthe relationship between the customer and\n\n520\n00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.460\nthe service provider,\nwe have to think about,\n\n521\n00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:08.230\nyou have the kind of things that we're\ngonna look at, responsibility allocation,\n\n522\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.920\nwho's responsible for what aspects for\nprotection in that relationship.\n\n523\n00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.770\nSo whose managing the back end data,\nwhose providing physical access control,\n\n524\n00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.210\nlogical access control,\nthese are things we'd want to be aware of.\n\n525\n00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.040\nTransparency very important, we talked\nabout this and why this is so important.\n\n526\n00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.570\nPurpose, specification, limitation on\ndata collection usage and consumption.\n\n527\n00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:31.330\nCollect data for certain reasons, only use\nit for those reasons, be transparent with\n\n528\n00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.750\nthe users that are providing it,\nprovide an opt-out clause for them.\n\n529\n00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.560\nSafely manage data and\ndestroy it when it is no longer necessary.\n\n530\n00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.450\nSo data retention,\ndata erasure become important.\n\n531\n00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:45.810\nAnd also contractual safeguards and data\ntransfers into and out of third parties,\n\n532\n00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.960\nor third countries entities as we were\ntalking about should be stipulated and\n\n533\n00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.755\ntightly controlled contractually.\n\n534\n00:28:50.755 --> 00:28:54.120\nMeaning if we are going to move data we\nhave to stipulate under what conditions\n\n535\n00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.680\nand through what systems and what\nmechanisms in order to do so properly.\n\n536\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.250\nAnd then if we do so\nwithin the boundaries of the contract and\n\n537\n00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:03.390\nthe agreement, then there is a way\nin which we can manage risk and\n\n538\n00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.600\nallocate responsibility and\naccountability.\n\n539\n00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.670\nIf we do so outside the framework of\nthe contract, it may be very tough for\n\n540\n00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.050\nus to do that, and\nover time may prove to be a challenge.\n\n541\n00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.658\nSo we have to consider and\nthink about that as well.\n\n542\n00:29:13.658 --> 00:29:17.500\nWe also wanna think about the advent of\nsomething I referred to in a prior episode\n\n543\n00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.580\ncalled the PLA.\n\n544\n00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.680\nThe privacy level agreement, which is\nbecoming more and more important today.\n\n545\n00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.030\nWe talked a lot of about SLAs and\nOLAs, service level agreements and\n\n546\n00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.470\noperational level agreements.\n\n547\n00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:31.520\nThe idea of the service level agreements\nis essentially the contract between\n\n548\n00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.440\nthe customer and the provider with regards\nto the essence of service and how will be\n\n549\n00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.560\nmanaged, and ultimately, how it is going\nto be maintained at what levels and\n\n550\n00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.370\nwith what penalties if we\ndon't meet hose obligations.\n\n551\n00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:47.000\nA privacy level agreement lays out very\nsimilar concepts it provides clear and\n\n552\n00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.540\neffective ways to communicate\nthe levels of personal data\n\n553\n00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:53.100\nprotection that the service provider\nneeds to afford us as a customer.\n\n554\n00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.680\nIt is going to be a partner to the SLA,\n\n555\n00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.030\ntypically it is negotiated\nas a separate add on.\n\n556\n00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.680\nAnd a to the hosting\nagreements oftentimes.\n\n557\n00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:04.780\nAnd it provides a way to offer contractual\nprotection, and obligation management, for\n\n558\n00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.380\nboth the provider, and the customer,\nwith regards to protection of data.\n\n559\n00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.220\nSo, when we have PII, personally\nidentifiable information concerns,\n\n560\n00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:16.730\nwe may very well seek to, look at the\nnegotiation, and the maintenance of a PLA\n\n561\n00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:20.170\nwith our provider to ensure that we\nhave the proper protections in place.\n\n562\n00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:23.290\nIt's not unusual today by any\nmeans to see this happening, so\n\n563\n00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.850\nit's kind of an interesting vehicle\nthat we at least want to be aware of.\n\n564\n00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:29.450\nAny constraints that arise in regards of\nprotection, can then be negotiated and\n\n565\n00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:34.060\nmanaged within the border and the confines\nand the constraints of the PLA, so\n\n566\n00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.540\nit's important for us to consider.\n\n567\n00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.120\nWe have to think about the Cloud Security\nAlliance as we've talked about several\n\n568\n00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.040\ntimes here.\n\n569\n00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:43.200\nThey actually have a very specific set\nof controls that may be of value to us.\n\n570\n00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.720\nI did not ask you to do\nthis ahead of time, so\n\n571\n00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.100\nI'm gonna give you a moment to\nset this up while we're talking.\n\n572\n00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.120\nIf you don't mind sir, if you could go\nto the Cloud Security Alliance website.\n\n573\n00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.560\nWe've been there before,\ncloudsecurityalliance.org.\n\n574\n00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.900\nWe'll give Daniel a moment to find that.\n\n575\n00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.590\nAnd then, Daniel, when you get there,\njust give me quick heads up when you,\n\n576\n00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:03.665\nif you could surf for Cloud Controls\nMatrix, CCM, should be version\n\n577\n00:31:03.665 --> 00:31:07.910\n3.01 I belive now, which you'll probably\nfind a link to download it, I'm sure.\n\n578\n00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.810\nAnd when you get that,\nif you could bring it up.\n\n579\n00:31:09.810 --> 00:31:12.580\nIt will be a spreadsheet ultimately,\nso you probably have to download and\n\n580\n00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:13.620\nopen that up.\n\n581\n00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.140\nWhile he's setting that up,\nwe'll take a moment to get that ready,\n\n582\n00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.540\nwe'll since look at a document\nthat is maintained by the CSA.\n\n583\n00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.040\nUpdated every so often, it was a updated\nrecently at the tail-end of 2015,\n\n584\n00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.920\nso it's updated not that long ago.\n\n585\n00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.690\nProvides some mappings and or cross\nrelationships for all the main industry,\n\n586\n00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:34.220\naccepted security standards regulations\nand controls and compliance framework.\n\n587\n00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.815\nSo, we're gonna see essentially\na cross-reference matrix that allows\n\n588\n00:31:38.815 --> 00:31:43.112\nus to compare what protections and\ncontrols are in multiple areas and\n\n589\n00:31:43.112 --> 00:31:46.961\nas a result of that we can kind of\ndo an xy axis thing, look up and\n\n590\n00:31:46.961 --> 00:31:51.876\nsee what this protection is maybe in this\ncontrol area for cobit for instance.\n\n591\n00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:54.567\nAnd then what it looks\nlike under pipetta or\n\n592\n00:31:54.567 --> 00:31:57.707\nwhat it looks like under\nthe German privacy laws or\n\n593\n00:31:57.707 --> 00:32:03.109\nwhat it looks like under ISO 27001 Or\nISO 31000 or whatever the case may be.\n\n594\n00:32:03.109 --> 00:32:06.767\nSo Daniel signaled me that he's good,\nso if we could take a look quickly,\n\n595\n00:32:06.767 --> 00:32:08.840\nthank you very much, at the screen.\n\n596\n00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.680\nAnd if we can, you're gonna need to\nprobably take me out of the image for\n\n597\n00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.080\na minute so\nwe can see full screen, thank you.\n\n598\n00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.880\nAnd you're probably gonna\nhave to zoom in a little bit.\n\n599\n00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:17.960\nYou're gonna wanna scroll, make sure\nyou're scrolled all the way over to\n\n600\n00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.280\nthe left on the bottom scroll tab, to make\nsure that we are at the beginning of that.\n\n601\n00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.760\nAnd then you'll see there, yeah, just make\nsure we're all the way over, perfect.\n\n602\n00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:31.430\nAnd then if you look up a little bit, and\nlet's see if we can zoom in a little bit\n\n603\n00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:35.640\nmore on the gray horizontal header because\nthat's where all the definitions are.\n\n604\n00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.230\nSo what we're gonna see there is we're\ngonna see the control domain on the left.\n\n605\n00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.800\nWe're then gonna see the older mapping for\nthe CCM version 2.0 control ID.\n\n606\n00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.900\nThe updated control specification\ncurrently for version three point one.\n\n607\n00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:52.010\nAnd then as we scroll over to\nthe right we're gonna start to see\n\n608\n00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.970\nthe authentication or\nthe architectural relevancy rather for\n\n609\n00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.760\nphysical, network, compute storage\napp data, so x's indicate yes or\n\n610\n00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:05.670\nno, then we're gonna see, as we continue\nover, the service model SAS pass IAS.\n\n611\n00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:08.890\nSo we're gonna see the protections\nwere forwarded, in various areas.\n\n612\n00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.880\nThen as we continue to scroll over,\nwe're gonna see, the, and\n\n613\n00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.960\nyou're probably gonna have to\ngo down to scroll over, I know.\n\n614\n00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:16.140\nSo, you'll have to move over a little bit.\n\n615\n00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:18.030\nWe're gonna then see, whoops.\n\n616\n00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:18.550\n>> Too far.\n\n617\n00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:19.790\n>> Yeah not quite so far, yeah.\n\n618\n00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:21.310\nSo somewhere, yeah right around there.\n\n619\n00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:24.120\nAnd I know it's hard,\nbecause it's such a wide, broad,\n\n620\n00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.120\npiece of you know real estate that we're\nkind of scrolling through, so I get that.\n\n621\n00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.050\nSo we're gonna see\nthe supplier relationships,\n\n622\n00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:35.320\nthe service provider target and\nor consumer and\n\n623\n00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.170\nthen we're gonna start to see all\nthe different control frameworks, right?\n\n624\n00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:38.800\nSo A.\n\n625\n00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.440\nAnd then from we're gonna\ngo over alphabetically and\n\n626\n00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:46.470\nstart to see Canada's as I mentioned,\nthe BSI in Germany.\n\n627\n00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:51.660\nWe're gonna see all sorts of\ndifferent ones there as we continue\n\n628\n00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:57.390\nover various versions you're gonna\nsee which is the European framework.\n\n629\n00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:00.200\nYou're gonna see as we\ncontinue over FedRAMP,\n\n630\n00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.200\nEuropean Union data privacy protection,\nwe're gonna see just all sorts.\n\n631\n00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.640\nFERPA, GAAP, ISO 27001,\nHIPAA HITECH, so you're\n\n632\n00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:12.990\ngonna see a cross referencing of all of\nthese different controls in every area.\n\n633\n00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:16.750\nYou're gonna see okay, in this framework,\nthese controls, there's the Jericho Forum,\n\n634\n00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:21.110\nwhich is remember, part of the CSA\nEnterprise Security Architecture we looked\n\n635\n00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.110\nat for security and risk management so\nyou can see all the different things ITAR\n\n636\n00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:31.020\nwhich is the referenced in the United\nStates for the export controls for\n\n637\n00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.640\nweapons of mass destruction which\nsounds kind of crazy in the cloud but\n\n638\n00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.060\ncomputer technology and\nthings like encryption algorithms\n\n639\n00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.489\nare actually protected and\nare controlled under and\n\n640\n00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:45.240\nunder the arrangement because\nthey're seen as dual use goods.\n\n641\n00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.210\nSo we actually see them referenced here\neven though we're also talking about\n\n642\n00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.400\nnuclear weapons and chemical agents right.\n\n643\n00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.910\nSo it's just a question of what's there.\n\n644\n00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:54.690\nBut you could see you know\nthe Mexico federal law for\n\n645\n00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:56.090\nthe protection of personal data.\n\n646\n00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:00.560\nYou could see NERC CIP which\nare the regulatory statutes for\n\n647\n00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.630\nthe energy industry.\n\n648\n00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.570\nThe nuclear energy industry in\nthe United States and Canada.\n\n649\n00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.830\nThere's all sorts of stuff there,\nall the NIST standards.\n\n650\n00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:10.750\nSo it does a great job of cross\nreferencing each of the control elements\n\n651\n00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.790\ndiscussed at the very beginning\nin the extreme left hand corner,\n\n652\n00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:15.250\nacross every one of these frameworks.\n\n653\n00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.480\nIt's an incredibly valuable tool for\n\n654\n00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.360\nthe Cloud security professional\nto have at their disposal.\n\n655\n00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:25.940\nThe CCM, the cloud controls matrix,\nregardless of version, is going to be\n\n656\n00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:31.530\nvery important for you as a CCSP,\nto be able to understand and reference.\n\n657\n00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.170\nLet me be clear and put this in context,\nso, you're on an exam,\n\n658\n00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:38.280\nthey're not going to ask you hey,\nwhat's column A U 5 gonna say,\n\n659\n00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.430\nyou gotta know it's this\nwe're not going to do that.\n\n660\n00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.910\nI mean that's just unrealistic, but\n\n661\n00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.080\nwhat we are going to do is ask you\nwhat the value of the CCM is and\n\n662\n00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.320\nwhether you understand what it is and how\nto use it and why it would be appropriate.\n\n663\n00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.840\nSo being aware of it, downloading it,\n\n664\n00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.150\ntaking a look at it,\nperhaps using it to cross reference one or\n\n665\n00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.160\nmore standards to understand the kind\nof controls that will come to bear\n\n666\n00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:01.360\nwould be a really great opportunity for\nyou to essentially get to know the tool.\n\n667\n00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.510\nAnd then to use it\nprofessionally as needed.\n\n668\n00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.510\nWhen you have to look this stuff up\nit's just an easy handy reference.\n\n669\n00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.600\nI mean today you could Google these things\nbut you'd have to Google a bunch of\n\n670\n00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.740\ndifferent individual queries to find all\nthis information referable in one place.\n\n671\n00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.720\nWhereas here you've got\nit all in one location.\n\n672\n00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.020\nSo it may just be valuable for\nyou to consider and to think about but\n\n673\n00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.120\nit is a really, really useful tool helps\nus to understand how to manage controls\n\n674\n00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.590\nfor privacy and data protection\nmeasures across every framework\n\n675\n00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.470\nthat usually is gonna come into play and\n\n676\n00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:31.470\neven some you've probably never heard\nof before like, let's be honest, right?\n\n677\n00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.840\nSo you want to think about that and\nobviously think about the value of that.\n\n678\n00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.940\nIf you think about what we could do here,\nyou can cross reference all these,\n\n679\n00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.230\nyou could assess and review,\nperform your risk analysis,\n\n680\n00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.560\nidentify applicable law provisions\nthat are gonna come into play here.\n\n681\n00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.980\nYou could design your security policies\nand implement the security policy and\n\n682\n00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:53.120\nthen go back and assess and review across\nmultiple frameworks across multiple\n\n683\n00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.700\ngeographies and multiple countries to\nessentially ensure you've got it right.\n\n684\n00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.900\nSo it's an incredibly powerful tool,\nand it really does help us\n\n685\n00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.960\nas security practitioners to\nunderstand the intricacies and\n\n686\n00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:06.530\nsome of the interplays of\nthese jurisdictional and\n\n687\n00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:10.080\napplicable law questions, so it's one\nresource, not the only one, but it's\n\n688\n00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.020\ncertainly a very authoritative one that\nyou want to look at as a CCSP potentially.\n\n689\n00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:15.830\nSo you may just want to reference that.\n\n690\n00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:19.160\nAgain, the cloud security alliance,\nso cloudsecurityalliance.org.\n\n691\n00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.480\nYou go out and look for CCM,\nthe cloud controls matrix, and\n\n692\n00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.600\ncurrently version 3.01, but\nwho knows what it'll be in the future.\n\n693\n00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:28.510\nBut whatever it is, look up the most\nrecent version and take a look at it and\n\n694\n00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:30.050\nuse it whenever you have a question.\n\n695\n00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.300\nOtherwise you'd have to be some\nsort of crazy savant to be able to\n\n696\n00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:34.800\nmemorize that entire matrix.\n\n697\n00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.650\nThat's why we create these things, so\n\n698\n00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:39.270\nthat we don't have to remember\nif they're references for\n\n699\n00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:43.970\nus so that we can go back and say, okay I\nneed to protect some private information.\n\n700\n00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:44.880\nWhat's the best way we can do that?\n\n701\n00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:47.140\nBecause I'm gonna be working\nin these jurisdictions,\n\n702\n00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:53.080\nthese organizations that you require\ncertain legal aspects of myself.\n\n703\n00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:53.900\nAnd I'm working with them,\n\n704\n00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.980\nso you've got to keep that in mind\nas you implement these theories.\n\n705\n00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:03.200\nAdam, big topic today, definitely to\nremember that we are not a free agent.\n\n706\n00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.530\nWe do have legal constraints\naround us as IT people and\n\n707\n00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.270\nas security people specifically.\n\n708\n00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:12.180\nWe gotta take those into consideration\nas we build our systems and\n\n709\n00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.230\nbuild our environments.\n\n710\n00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:17.170\nWe want to stay compliant because\notherwise like you said, we could either\n\n711\n00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.930\nbe monetary penalized or even criminally\npenalized and that is the penalization,\n\n712\n00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.878\nor both, and that is definitely something\nthat I don't want to partake in.\n\n713\n00:38:24.878 --> 00:38:28.990\nTake advantage of all these systems and\nespecially this really cool matrix.\n\n714\n00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.740\nThat's something you definitely\nwant to download and look over and\n\n715\n00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:34.980\nso you can stay out of the weeds\nwhen it comes to that.\n\n716\n00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:40.870\nAdam, thanks for reminding us of these\nfacts that we do have responsibilities,\n\n717\n00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:42.810\nand they are legal in some cases.\n\n718\n00:38:42.810 --> 00:38:45.260\nSo, be aware of that as you\nbuild your environment.\n\n719\n00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.520\nBut we've come to the end of another great\nepisode, we're gonna go ahead and signoff.\n\n720\n00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.290\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowery.\n\n721\n00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.040\n>> I'm cloud control matrix\nAdam Gordon version 4.2.\n\n722\n00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.882\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.580\nI'm your host Daniel Laurey and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.030\nCertified Cloud Security Professional\nseries.\n\n5\n00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.570\nJoining us back in the studio today is\na man who is apparently growing antlers\n\n6\n00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.370\nas our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.810\nAdam, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n8\n00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.790\n>> It's the Rocky and Bullwinkle show,\nremember that when you were a kid?\n\n9\n00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.580\nGee, Rocky, Natasha and Boris, right.\n\n10\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.870\nAll right, so when we think about and\ncontinue to think about the growth of\n\n11\n00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.370\nCloud and Cloud-based technologies,\nwe wanna focus on the idea of how we're\n\n12\n00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.400\ngonna design and\nimplement data rights management.\n\n13\n00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.860\nAlso look at retention policies,\ncapabilities around that.\n\n14\n00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.790\nWe'll talk a little bit about that.\n\n15\n00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.000\nAnd also data event management,\ntraceability,\n\n16\n00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.020\nauditability, all those kind of\nthings that we are concerned about\n\n17\n00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.370\nas we round out our conversations\nwith regards to data.\n\n18\n00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.790\nWe've been talking a lot about data and\nrisk management associated with data, and\n\n19\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.740\nhow to protect data,\n\n20\n00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.960\nthe legal ramifications of jurisdiction\nversus applicable law in prior episodes.\n\n21\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.230\nAnd we talked about protection mechanisms\nalong the lines of Doing, data\n\n22\n00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.720\ntokenization, and all the different things\nthat we may do along with encryption.\n\n23\n00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.580\nBut we also talk about, and\nthink about digital rights management.\n\n24\n00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.950\nWe've discussed DOP\ntechnology a little bit.\n\n25\n00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.330\nData loss prevention.\n\n26\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.670\nDRM, technology, the ability to be able\nto provide sticky attributes that will,\n\n27\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.840\nstay with data, and protect the data, as\nI mentioned in one of our prior episodes.\n\n28\n00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.480\nIs it an important thought process for us?\n\n29\n00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.870\nWe have essentially two\nkinds of categories or\n\n30\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.210\ntwo kinds of variants that\nDRM with normally be thought\n\n31\n00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.870\nof as being applied through consumer\nbased DRM and their enterprise DRM.\n\n32\n00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.329\nThe enterprise DRM is often referred\nto as IRM, information risk management.\n\n33\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.690\nAnd we see that in the corporate space.\n\n34\n00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.170\nThat's really where we, as CPSCs would\ntraditionally spend our time and focus.\n\n35\n00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.010\nSo with regards to enterprise based DRM or\nIRM solutions we add\n\n36\n00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.390\nextra layers of access control and\ncapability management on top of the data.\n\n37\n00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.200\nWe create these,\n\n38\n00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.570\nas I referenced them, sticky attributes\nthat will stay with the data.\n\n39\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.320\nIt's agnostic to the location of the data,\nit is gonna stay with the data, it being\n\n40\n00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.510\nthe attributes and the protection,\nregardless of where the data is.\n\n41\n00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.630\nWhere it is consumed.\n\n42\n00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.150\nYou open it up on your mobile\ndevice sitting in an airport.\n\n43\n00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.990\nYou read it on a plane 35,000\nfeet flying above an ocean.\n\n44\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.460\nYou're sitting in a cube and\nyou're looking at the data.\n\n45\n00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.080\nIt's all the same.\n\n46\n00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.500\nIt's protected the same way.\n\n47\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.245\nSo it's location.\n\n48\n00:02:31.245 --> 00:02:36.235\nDiagnostic, we use a centralized\nmanagement thought process and\n\n49\n00:02:36.235 --> 00:02:40.015\na centralized management system, to\nessentially assign rights out to the data\n\n50\n00:02:40.015 --> 00:02:43.055\nand then to make sure those data\nelements are going to be protected,\n\n51\n00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:45.205\nby using a base line protection profile.\n\n52\n00:02:45.205 --> 00:02:46.875\nBy doing continuous monitoring and\n\n53\n00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:51.135\nreiteration of any deviation gaps\nwe find through DELTA Analysis.\n\n54\n00:02:51.135 --> 00:02:53.860\nWe have a very standard and\nstraight forward solution.\n\n55\n00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.490\nBut in the cloud, like anything else,\nwe may have complicating factors, right?\n\n56\n00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.300\nSo we have to consider the most\nappropriate method to provide these\n\n57\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.440\nsecurity functions to data in the cloud.\n\n58\n00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.780\nIs IRM the best choice?\n\n59\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.420\nIs there another way for us to do that?\n\n60\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.470\nWill that afford the proper protections?\n\n61\n00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.330\nIt may be a good solution, but\nit may not always be the best solution.\n\n62\n00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.070\nWe have to think about that, and\nsee rather or not the protection\n\n63\n00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.270\nafforded is going to be coadministered\nwith the kind of data we have, and\n\n64\n00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.500\nthe value of that data in\nterms of the protection.\n\n65\n00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.940\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n66\n00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.010\nIRM typically runs with an agent-based\nsolution on the endpoint\n\n67\n00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.640\nwhich means we have to be\nable to install software.\n\n68\n00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.950\nAnd as a result of that, we need physical\nlocation access to the device or\n\n69\n00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.770\nlogical ability to be able to get there.\n\n70\n00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.030\nWe need administrative rights and\npolicy based management to do that.\n\n71\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.240\nIf it's somebody's personal device their\nown cell phone we may not be able to\n\n72\n00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.720\ninstall an IRM agent on it or\nwe have to prepare the end user for\n\n73\n00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.000\nthe fact we're gonna take\nover the device and do that.\n\n74\n00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.380\nAnd that may or may not be a point of\ncontention so we have to be aware of that\n\n75\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.200\npolicy automation features can be used to\nbetter promote adoption and ultimately to\n\n76\n00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.730\nmanage and standardise across the platform\nbut we have to be aware of that as well.\n\n77\n00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.570\nWe need to be also aware of the fact that\nwe're going to use software most likely\n\n78\n00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.270\nthat is IRM aware to be\nable to access the data so\n\n79\n00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.020\nthey're maybe a a proprietary\nsoftware reader or\n\n80\n00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.430\nsome sort of application that IRM centric\nand IRM aware that has to be used.\n\n81\n00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.560\nSo for instance when I train as\nan authorized or certified Trainor for all\n\n82\n00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.090\nthe vendors that I work for, Microsoft,\nVMware, whoever the case may be.\n\n83\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.910\nMost of the technology vendors\ntoday use IRM for their courseware.\n\n84\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.460\nThey protect their intellectual\nproperty and other words with it.\n\n85\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.570\nAnd as a result of that you have to use\na specific kind of reader to be able to\n\n86\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.010\naccess the electronic book or the e-book\ncourseware that's very popular today\n\n87\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.440\nwhich enforces the IRM Solutions on the\nplatform and allows you to only printout\n\n88\n00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.780\na certain number of pages or only open\nthe book on a certain number of devices,\n\n89\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.250\nyou have things like that, and so\nyou wanna make sure you're aware of that.\n\n90\n00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.360\nWe can Integrate IRM into other\ntechnology platform devices and\n\n91\n00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.680\nprotection mechanisms like DLP,\nData Loss Prevention.\n\n92\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.160\nSo we integrate that ability for\n\n93\n00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.370\nthe sticky app to stay with the data\nin the stream and have the whitelist,\n\n94\n00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.670\nblacklist Concept of DLP working to filter\nout information that is not appropriate.\n\n95\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.070\nSo a lot of times you'll\ndownload this ebooks and\n\n96\n00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.910\nthey come in a,\nyour kinda weird data extension format\n\n97\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.920\nthat no known program other than\nthe viewer itself will open.\n\n98\n00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.030\nSo as a result you are not able to use\nthe data unless you have the appropriate\n\n99\n00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.560\nreader with the IRM writes\nmanagement implemented that way.\n\n100\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.640\nSo it's just something to consider\nobviously the appropriate tool\n\n101\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.430\nselection here is gonna be really\nimpacting us from the perspective of\n\n102\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.720\nare we getting persistent protections, one\nof the key drivers for a DRM and IRM, so\n\n103\n00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.920\nwe want to understand that dynamic policy\ncontrol, very important for us to change\n\n104\n00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.620\nthe policy on the fly, essentially have it\npropagate out to all the various areas.\n\n105\n00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.810\nMake sure we have an automatic\nexpiration of content capabilities so\n\n106\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.590\nwe can expire the licensing or\n\n107\n00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.479\nthe access to the content when somebody\nis no longer authorized to use it.\n\n108\n00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.710\nContinuous audit trail for\ntraceability and auditability so\n\n109\n00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.260\nwe can see who's doing what\nunder what circumstances.\n\n110\n00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.910\nAnd there is non-repudiation\nassociated with that and\n\n111\n00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.090\nproof of origin associated\nwith that as well.\n\n112\n00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.580\nAnd we should have support for existing\nauthentication security infrastructure.\n\n113\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.010\nWe should tie back in to directory\nservices, the auditing, the monitoring\n\n114\n00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.000\ncapabilities that we already possess\nin order to ensure that we are taking\n\n115\n00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.540\nfull advantage of the infrastructure we've\nalready built as opposed to just of going\n\n116\n00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.650\nout and spending a whole bunch of money\nto build new infrastructure without\n\n117\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.120\nnecessarily reaping the benefit of the tie\nback into the existing architecture.\n\n118\n00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.890\nIt's easy to build a brand new box.\n\n119\n00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.390\nIt's a lot harder to exist in it or\nto integrate it to the existing box.\n\n120\n00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.090\nBut the challenges if we keep building new\nboxes, we got a whole bunch of boxes but\n\n121\n00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.530\nno way for them to talk to each other,\nat a certain point in time,\n\n122\n00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.130\nand it becomes very difficult for\nus to actually manage that system.\n\n123\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.190\nSo we do have to really\nthink about integration, and\n\n124\n00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.740\ninoperability is especially important\nwith regards to the cloud because of\n\n125\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.720\nthe broad reaching nature of the systems\nand the data that we create there.\n\n126\n00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.810\nIt's very, very important for\nus to consider that!\n\n127\n00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.200\nWe should be able to understand how\nto use Access Control capabilities,\n\n128\n00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.810\nAccess Control.\n\n129\n00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.940\nThis and functions and be able to map and\nuser access across the enterprise based on\n\n130\n00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.440\ndata, integrate with any third party\nprotocols and the systems we use,\n\n131\n00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.760\nemail systems for instance,\ncontact management systems, web services,\n\n132\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.440\nall these things we should have\nstandardized programmatic interfaces or\n\n133\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.470\nAPI's that we could leverage and use.\n\n134\n00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.910\nSo if you buy this off the shelf,\n\n135\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.820\ngreat program that works with everything,\nawesome.\n\n136\n00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.650\nIf you buy this really bizarre program\nmade in some backwater somewhere\n\n137\n00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.250\nthat only two people on the planet know\nhow to use, It may not talk too much, and\n\n138\n00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.840\nas a result of that, you may not be able\nto really use it with anything else.\n\n139\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.610\nI had one of my customers have this happen\nto them about a year and a half ago.\n\n140\n00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.350\nThey bought a web filtering system.\n\n141\n00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.070\nA URL, essentially,\nproxy filtering solution.\n\n142\n00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.500\nAnd they got it from a company that was,\nand\n\n143\n00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.720\nthis is by no means in any way, a slight\nto anybody, any country, any thing.\n\n144\n00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.890\nJust generically saying, they happened\nto be based overseas in Europe.\n\n145\n00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.880\nNot because the country that they\nwere based in is good or bad.\n\n146\n00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.365\nNot because they did or\ndid not do a good job with their software.\n\n147\n00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:55.215\nThey just happened not\nbe based in the U.S.\n\n148\n00:07:55.215 --> 00:07:58.125\nis all I'm pointing out, and so\nthey bought this software for them.\n\n149\n00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:01.460\nIt was recommended to them by a bunch of\ndifferent Vendors as well as a bunch of\n\n150\n00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.930\npeople that had already used it.\n\n151\n00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.447\nAnd they thought it was a good choice they\ngot it and they went to implement it and\n\n152\n00:08:07.447 --> 00:08:11.758\nthe support while it was very good was\nbased in Europe and was coming out of,\n\n153\n00:08:11.758 --> 00:08:15.260\nI think it was It was Eastern Europe\nif I remember correctly.\n\n154\n00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.440\nAnd so it was really more a question\nof timing, more than anything else.\n\n155\n00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.810\nIt was very hard to bring them online\nbecause of the time zone difference and\n\n156\n00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.110\nthe language difference.\n\n157\n00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.960\nWhile they did speak English as a language\nfor support, it wasn't a primary language.\n\n158\n00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.040\nAnd so some of the engineers that they\nwere dealing with to stand up the program\n\n159\n00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.340\nwere not as comfortable speaking english\nas they were another language, so\n\n160\n00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.430\nit presented a bit of a challenge just\ntrying to get the moving parts together\n\n161\n00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.120\nbefore they could actually\nimplement the software.\n\n162\n00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.230\nWhich turned out to be a good choice but\n\n163\n00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.200\nwas a little rocky to get started with,\nright?\n\n164\n00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.930\nTo get it all up and\n\n165\n00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.780\nrunning, and so it just took extra\ntime and it delayed the project by\n\n166\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.960\na couple of weeks til they ironed out\nall the little implementation details.\n\n167\n00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.910\nSo we laugh about it now, but it's not\nfunny when you're going through it.\n\n168\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.890\nSo you just want to make sure right\nthat those kind of things are there.\n\n169\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.830\nObviously supporting document types.\n\n170\n00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.730\nThey're gonna be prevalent\nin your organization.\n\n171\n00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.250\nAlso really important,\nif it doesn't work with PDFs,\n\n172\n00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.610\nand you do a bunch of PDFs that may\nbe deal breaker for you, right?\n\n173\n00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.150\nIt just may not be such a good choice.\n\n174\n00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.870\nSo you wanna be aware of that,\nyou wanna be thinking about that,\n\n175\n00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:13.380\nthese are all the kind of things\nthat we have to be concerned with.\n\n176\n00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:17.390\nAnd really, in our mind at least\nthe highlights anyway have to have\n\n177\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.140\nin our thoughts as we design and\n\n178\n00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.960\nthink about implementing data\nrights management, right?\n\n179\n00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.390\nIt's very very important to understand\nthe nature of data right's management,\n\n180\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.640\nthe interplay between consumer based and\nenterprise Based DRM,\n\n181\n00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:32.120\nwe're really focused primarily as we said\nas security professionals on the cloud on\n\n182\n00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.560\nenterprise DRM,\nconsumer DRM kind of takes care of itself.\n\n183\n00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.210\nIt's driven by the company or\nthe application or\n\n184\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.600\nthe entity that's providing that access.\n\n185\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.960\nWhile we may oversee it and\nhave a sense of it,\n\n186\n00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.070\nit may not be something we deal with\nthe same way with policy based management.\n\n187\n00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.920\nWe're not buying a system that does that,\n\n188\n00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.170\nwe're just simply being aware of a fact\nthat another vendor is managing it.\n\n189\n00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.700\nSo we're really focused primarily on\nthe enterprise side, right, with Ira.\n\n190\n00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.090\nSo we wanna be aware of those things and\n\n191\n00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.540\nreally have a sense of how to\nintegrate that into the cloud.\n\n192\n00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.940\nIt is very important for\nus to consider, and\n\n193\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.590\nas the CCSP,\nsomething we would wanna focus on.\n\n194\n00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:06.980\nAs we turn our attention towards planning,\nand implementing, data retention,\n\n195\n00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.300\ndeletion, archival policies, how do we\ndeal with these things, we have to also be\n\n196\n00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.170\nthinking, you know from the risk\nperspective we've been talking about.\n\n197\n00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.480\nFrom the data architecture and\n\n198\n00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.240\ncloud security perspective that\nwe've been sharing with you.\n\n199\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.570\nWhat is data retention?\n\n200\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.560\nWe know it's just the period\nof time we maintain data for\n\n201\n00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.380\nbased on the value the data has\nto the organization, both through\n\n202\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.750\nclassification categorization,\nas we've shared with you before.\n\n203\n00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.950\nSo good retention policies\nhave to be documented.\n\n204\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.840\nThey have to be well thought out.\n\n205\n00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.680\nAs we talked about in one\nof the earlier episodes,\n\n206\n00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.620\nwe have to take into account\nthings like Moore's Law.\n\n207\n00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.310\nWe have to take into account the strength,\nthe voracity, the duration, the longevity,\n\n208\n00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.440\nif you can think of any other\nsynonyms you can throw in there,\n\n209\n00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.010\nfeel free to do that,\nof the protection versus the need, right?\n\n210\n00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.570\nWe want to keep data protected for\n100 years.\n\n211\n00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:56.400\nWe have a need to do so, what kind of\nprotection mechanisms are we gonna choose.\n\n212\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.810\nAnd are they appropriate,\nwill they stand up to the test of time?\n\n213\n00:10:58.810 --> 00:10:59.780\nThey may or they may not.\n\n214\n00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.170\nAs we found out,\nwe may have to do some complicated math.\n\n215\n00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.100\nGet out the abacus and the slide rule.\n\n216\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:08.210\nThe cocktail napkin, the paper and the\npencil, and do some quick calculations.\n\n217\n00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.410\nAnd more importantly, we have to\nreassess that protection need, and\n\n218\n00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.830\nthat level of protection,\non an ongoing basis, regularly.\n\n219\n00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.250\nOnce a year, twice a year,\nonce every other year.\n\n220\n00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.790\nThat's open to interpretation.\n\n221\n00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.530\nWhat's not open to interpretation is\nthe fact we must reassess how frequently\n\n222\n00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.770\nmay be function of environmental\nvariables and a lot of other factors but\n\n223\n00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:30.480\nwe have to know we do and we should\nreassess and that is important so\n\n224\n00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.300\ngood data retention policies should\nclearly stipulate the retention period.\n\n225\n00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.260\n50 years.\n\n226\n00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.470\nPeriod, end of sentence.\n\n227\n00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.930\nAt least we have a sense, right?\n\n228\n00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.190\nData formats that we're gonna support, the\ndata security level we're looking for and\n\n229\n00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:45.450\nthe retrieval procedures for\nthe enterprise that will be in play\n\n230\n00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.340\nas we go to pull data out of long\nterm storage if we have to use it.\n\n231\n00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.830\nYou had a situation a few years ago,\n\n232\n00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.390\nnot cloud based, but still kind of\nappropriate for this conversation.\n\n233\n00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.750\nWhere we had a bunch of data\n\n234\n00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.780\nthat was backed up at one our customer's\nlocations and they had been using tape\n\n235\n00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.360\nwhich is not unusually we still\nsee Tape being used today.\n\n236\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.280\nAlthough it's slowly but\n\n237\n00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.700\nsurely going our of fashion and we're\nusing other mechanisms to replace it.\n\n238\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.600\nBecause of the volumes of\ndata we deal with today,\n\n239\n00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.860\nand the time it takes to back the data up.\n\n240\n00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:17.140\nTape is not always the most cost\neffective from a time perspective these\n\n241\n00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.290\ndays anymore, It can be a slow\nmethod compared to some others, but\n\n242\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.870\nat the time we had a bunch of tape backups\nUsing, they were using DAT machines.\n\n243\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.160\nAnd the issue is not so\nmuch the technology, but\n\n244\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.540\nrather the drivers to\nsupport the technology.\n\n245\n00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.020\nBecause what happened is, these systems\nhad been installed on Windows NT 4 and\n\n246\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.280\nWindows 2000 boxes that had\nbeen upgraded along the way.\n\n247\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.690\nAnd eventually those 2000\nboxes were being retired.\n\n248\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:41.610\nThey were being virtualized and\nupgraded into 2008 or\n\n249\n00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.190\n2012 or whatever it was at the time.\n\n250\n00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.100\nAnd so those systems went away.\n\n251\n00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.710\nSo we archived all the data.\n\n252\n00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.530\nIt was sitting in tape.\n\n253\n00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:53.250\nIt was sitting in these physical\ntapes using these old access units.\n\n254\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.590\nThey actually had a restore event where\nthey had to go back and pull data back.\n\n255\n00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.570\nAnd so number one, since everything\nwas virtualized at that point.\n\n256\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.540\nPhysical tape,\nyou don't just run in virtual machines.\n\n257\n00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.130\nIt just doesn't work that way.\n\n258\n00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.540\nSo that was the first issue.\n\n259\n00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.290\nSo we have been smart enough to keep\nhardware laying around that we can put\n\n260\n00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.340\nthe tape units on.\n\n261\n00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.260\nBut, all the hardware had been\nwiped clean when we did the P2V,\n\n262\n00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.730\nthe physical to virtual conversions,\nthey essentially just mothballed the gear.\n\n263\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:19.630\nWe had to go and get the old operating\nsystems, download them, install.\n\n264\n00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.530\nNow that was easy in and of itself,\n\n265\n00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.680\ncuz Microsoft maintains these operating\nsystems, you can get a copy of them.\n\n266\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.590\nWe had copies of them along with\nthe licensing, that wasn't the issue.\n\n267\n00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.130\nThe issue was the drivers for the devices,\nto find the appropriate drivers,\n\n268\n00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.770\nbecause the vendor wasn't\nmaking these devices anymore,\n\n269\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.340\nthere were no drivers available for\ndownload, and that proved to be a major\n\n270\n00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:41.330\nchallenge until we finally found a way to\nbe able to come up with drivers that would\n\n271\n00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:45.250\nget these devices working so\nwe could essentially restore the data,\n\n272\n00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.790\nat least to that moment in time, get it\nand then put it into a different format.\n\n273\n00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.490\nSo sometimes you plan ahead, and\n\n274\n00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:55.050\nyou have all the pieces of the puzzle the\none thing that the customer forgot to do,\n\n275\n00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.440\nwas to make sure that they had a copy of\nthe media for the drivers for the devices.\n\n276\n00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.700\nThey had everything else.\n\n277\n00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.070\nLuckily we actually had images of\nthe systems that had been taken, we could\n\n278\n00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.480\nrestore the images, and then from there\nwe could essentially get the drivers and\n\n279\n00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.560\nall the things we needed\nto get the devices working.\n\n280\n00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.470\nAs part of the P to V,\n\n281\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.220\nwe had snap shotted images of\nessential we could restore it to.\n\n282\n00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.960\nIt was something that was available but\nit was just a nightmare to get through,\n\n283\n00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.990\nuntil we actually got it all worked out.\n\n284\n00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.990\nYou don't want to have to do that,\n\n285\n00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:24.355\nif it's not necessary So, making sure\nwe understand all those moving parts.\n\n286\n00:14:24.355 --> 00:14:25.585\npart of data retention.\n\n287\n00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:26.785\nVery, very important.\n\n288\n00:14:26.785 --> 00:14:28.885\nWe have to be aware of legislative,\nstatutory, and\n\n289\n00:14:28.885 --> 00:14:30.655\nregulatory compliance concerns.\n\n290\n00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:32.175\nSo we have to be aligned with that.\n\n291\n00:14:32.175 --> 00:14:34.555\nWe may decide to keep data for 50 years.\n\n292\n00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:37.235\nAnd when we start to put it into\nmothballs, there may be no statutory\n\n293\n00:14:37.235 --> 00:14:40.535\nrequirement, about the form, the function,\nand the nature of that data.\n\n294\n00:14:40.535 --> 00:14:42.575\nTen years in, somebody may pass the law.\n\n295\n00:14:42.575 --> 00:14:46.385\nIf we own that data, that data's still,\nat that point, now bound by the law.\n\n296\n00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:49.740\nEven though, you know ten years ago\nwhen the data was created it was not.\n\n297\n00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.050\nSo the problem becomes that the data\nthat is kept for that period of time,\n\n298\n00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:57.040\nmaybe become subject to revolving and\nchanging statutory requirements.\n\n299\n00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.100\nAnd there may or may not be\na grandfathering period for that.\n\n300\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.360\nSo we do have to be aware of that.\n\n301\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.920\n>> And my company I worked for,\nthe insurance company, they actually went\n\n302\n00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.780\nthrough something very, in that vein was\n>> A lawyer put up,\n\n303\n00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:10.660\nhave you filed a claim within this\namount of time, and this woman had.\n\n304\n00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.300\nShe had filed a claim with\nour insurance company.\n\n305\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.140\nWe had paid it.\n\n306\n00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.510\nIt was completed, it was done.\n\n307\n00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.540\nBut he just asked, did you file a claim.\n\n308\n00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.630\nAnd that lawyer showed up on our\ndoorsteps and said, I require to see,\n\n309\n00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.360\nhere's a subpoena to see your data.\n\n310\n00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.730\nAnd we had to hand it back;\n>> He discovered.\n\n311\n00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.940\n>> He had discovery, that's right.\n\n312\n00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.990\nAnd he sat in a In a very hot room,\nout in a metal building,\n\n313\n00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:32.670\ngoing through files over and over.\n\n314\n00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.490\nThey weren't digitized at that time but\nwe eventually digitized that stuff.\n\n315\n00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.730\nAnd now we had to say ok, how long are we\ngoing to keep this data lying around?\n\n316\n00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.516\nBecause he was able to successfully\ngarnish money from us, for her,\n\n317\n00:15:44.516 --> 00:15:46.422\neven though we had paid her claim.\n\n318\n00:15:46.422 --> 00:15:48.719\nBecause we had data laying around and\n\n319\n00:15:48.719 --> 00:15:53.473\nhe found one file that said something\nto the effect don't pay or something.\n\n320\n00:15:53.473 --> 00:15:56.875\nI forget what it was but he was\nlegally able to get money from us and\n\n321\n00:15:56.875 --> 00:15:59.521\ngive to her just because\nwe kept that data around.\n\n322\n00:15:59.521 --> 00:16:03.217\n>> Yes, Eddie, it brings up an interesting\nquestion because retention policies and\n\n323\n00:16:03.217 --> 00:16:04.168\nretention periods,\n\n324\n00:16:04.168 --> 00:16:08.180\nright, have to be tightly controlled\nas we've kind of been talking about.\n\n325\n00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.900\nMicrosoft got burned by this several years\nago when they were going through their\n\n326\n00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.670\nlawsuits both in Europe and ultimately\naround the world, but mainly in Europe,\n\n327\n00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.380\nwith regards to separating the browser\nfrom the operating system.\n\n328\n00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.620\nIt's more than a couple of\nyears ago at this point, but\n\n329\n00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.480\nwhen they were going through that whole IE\nis fundamental to the function of Windows.\n\n330\n00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.830\nNo it's not, yes it is.\n\n331\n00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.970\nA constraint that they had kind\nof boxed themselves into, and\n\n332\n00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.300\nthey got sued by the rest of the industry\nbecause of monopolistic trade practices.\n\n333\n00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.440\nThat whole thing took\nseveral years to unwind.\n\n334\n00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.560\nBut during the discovery phases\nin that particular set of cases.\n\n335\n00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:43.050\nBecause Microsoft at that point in time,\ndid not have this tight a data retention\n\n336\n00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:47.950\nset of policies that they do today,\nthey actually, the lawyers on both sides,\n\n337\n00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.910\nwere able to either successfully\nsubpoena through e-discovery or\n\n338\n00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.770\nfight the e-discovery subpoenas,\nbased on retention periods and\n\n339\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.360\npolicies that have been tightly\nstipulated, that there would or\n\n340\n00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.570\nwould not be certain information\nthat will be made available.\n\n341\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:03.710\nBecause legally under the law, regardless,\npretty much without exception, of where\n\n342\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.750\nyou operate today in a corporate world,\nyou are bound by not the law of the land.\n\n343\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.740\nYou must keep it for\nx number of days, weeks, months.\n\n344\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:15.440\nMost countries don't have data\nretention laws about all sorts of data.\n\n345\n00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.840\nThey may for corporate records, but\nnot for things like emails, for\n\n346\n00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:21.690\ninstance, that may have internal\ncommunication value but\n\n347\n00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:25.390\nare not gonna be specific to taxes paid or\nthings of that nature.\n\n348\n00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.390\nBut if the company on the books has\na data retention policy that clearly\n\n349\n00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:33.180\nstipulates we keep data for two weeks, or\ntwo months, or two years, or whatever,\n\n350\n00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:37.070\nthen that is essentially the extent that\nthe law will allow you to go back and\n\n351\n00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.720\nclaim and\ntherefore seek to recover data for.\n\n352\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.880\nAnd so the problem became if you don't\nhave a clearly defined data retention\n\n353\n00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.300\npolicy covering all types of data.\n\n354\n00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.920\nStandardize and\napplied equally across the board,\n\n355\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.160\nthen you are open to potentially\nvariances in that discovery order.\n\n356\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.810\nIf you had it and you said no matter what,\nother than corporate data covered by\n\n357\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:59.980\na federal law whatever the law, whatever\nthe of the land is for tax purposes,\n\n358\n00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.600\nbusiness purposes which\nis let's say seven years.\n\n359\n00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.390\nAnything else outside of that we keep for\n30 days on a rolling basis.\n\n360\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.270\nWe back it up,\n31st day shows up, it's gone.\n\n361\n00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.790\nYou want 30 days of data,\nthat's all we're giving you.\n\n362\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:12.820\nHere's your discovery order,\n\n363\n00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:16.400\nI don't care if it says 10 years,\nyou get 30 days cuz that's all we have.\n\n364\n00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.060\nAnd that's what the court will expect and\n\n365\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:21.350\nwhat the court will enforce, there\nreally isn't a lot of variance there.\n\n366\n00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.510\nIt's pretty well understood,\nthought process because the court could\n\n367\n00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.470\nsay that you're entitled to 10 years,\nbut if the business stipulates,\n\n368\n00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:33.010\nthey as a matter of standing policy and\npractice, only keep 10 or rather\n\n369\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.090\nonly keep a 30 days of rolling data,\nthen you can't expect anymore than that.\n\n370\n00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.240\nBut heaven help you, if you're not\na applying that in a standardized way,\n\n371\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.890\nand there's even one exception\nfound because what that does is\n\n372\n00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.790\nthat leads to an appearance\nof impropriety.\n\n373\n00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:51.380\nAs a result of that, the court is then\ngoing to allow that new discovery order to\n\n374\n00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:55.620\nbe broadly applied across the enterprise\nand investigators are going to show up,\n\n375\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:59.940\ntear open every piece of data, and\nevery data storage system you have,\n\n376\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.260\nlooking for the exceptions to that\nrule that goes out beyond 30 days.\n\n377\n00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:04.190\nEven though it may not exist.\n\n378\n00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:09.260\nAnd they're gonna stop and look at\neverything and you're gonna hate life for\n\n379\n00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:11.560\nthe next two weeks, two months,\ntwo years until it's done.\n\n380\n00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.490\nAnd then they find nothing.\n\n381\n00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.670\nBut they're gonna have\nthe right to come and look.\n\n382\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.096\nAnd that's the problem with data\nretention policies in new discovery,\n\n383\n00:19:18.096 --> 00:19:19.341\nespecially in the cloud.\n\n384\n00:19:19.341 --> 00:19:22.306\nIf it is not well documented,\nstandardized, and\n\n385\n00:19:22.306 --> 00:19:25.230\napplied to every piece\nof data the same way.\n\n386\n00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:29.340\nYou're opening yourself up to,\nin other words, a variation of that theme,\n\n387\n00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.140\nyou're gonna have a legal problem if\nanybody ever comes, knocks on your door.\n\n388\n00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.550\nSomeone says, hey by the way,\nI've got an order.\n\n389\n00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:37.880\nSomebody said it's okay for\nme to look, and boy, am I gonna look.\n\n390\n00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.760\nPrepare yourself.\n\n391\n00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.780\nSit down and get comfortable.\n\n392\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.210\nWe're gonna be here a while.\n\n393\n00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.060\nWe've seen a lot of that\nkind of activity occur.\n\n394\n00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.940\nAnd we wanna make sure that\nyou as CCSPs understand\n\n395\n00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.830\nthat the best thing you could do for your\ncustomer is give them the guidance and\n\n396\n00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.460\nthe understanding that they should\nhave a data retention policy.\n\n397\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:56.120\nIt should be clearly stipulated and it\nshould be applied through a standardized\n\n398\n00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.780\nthought process to every piece of data\nin that organization, regardless of who\n\n399\n00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:03.000\ncreates it, regardless of what\nposition they inhabit in the company.\n\n400\n00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.460\nAnd if there is an exception,\nit better be well documented.\n\n401\n00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.540\nThat'll be written down as an addendum or\na rider to that policy,\n\n402\n00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.700\nand you better have a very\ncompelling reason documented for\n\n403\n00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.730\nthat exception to document why\nyou're granting an exception and\n\n404\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.410\nunder what conditions and\nwhat the new exception will be.\n\n405\n00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.160\nIn other words,\nwhat is the extended retention or\n\n406\n00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.310\nshortened retention policy that\nyou're giving that exception.\n\n407\n00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.940\nAnd then manage that data specifically\nunder that set of conditions.\n\n408\n00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.260\nIf you're very tight on that you will\nprobably have some pushback, but\n\n409\n00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.360\nultimately there is not\na lot of liability there.\n\n410\n00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.740\nYou give them what their attention\npolicy and that's all you can provide.\n\n411\n00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.940\nBut if there's any variation,\nany openness to interpretation there.\n\n412\n00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:47.030\nLack of standardization is the key,\nthen the prosecution's gonna essentially\n\n413\n00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.960\ngonna stick on that, and you're going\nto have to open up everything, so\n\n414\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.690\nit's definitely something to consider.\n\n415\n00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:55.780\nSo data retention policy components,\nthe data mapping, data classification,\n\n416\n00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.320\ndata retention procedures,\nall very important.\n\n417\n00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.810\nMonitoring and maintenance solutions,\nhow are we gonna do that?\n\n418\n00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.510\nEverything should be standardized,\neverything should be written down,\n\n419\n00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:07.710\neverything should be clearly transparent\nand available and auditable.\n\n420\n00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.780\nIf you are saying you're doing it,\nlet's validate that and show me you are.\n\n421\n00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.550\nIf you are, hey I may want 10 years.\n\n422\n00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.490\nYou got 30 days.\n\n423\n00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:14.450\nI'm gonna have to take 30 days.\n\n424\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.600\nThat's just the way it is.\n\n425\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.190\nBut if I want 10 years, you got 30 days,\nbut over here in the corner I find 45\n\n426\n00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:23.260\ndays, that tells me there may be\nmore than 45 days somewhere else.\n\n427\n00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.120\nI'm gonna tear your world apart looking\nfor it, and I have the right to do\n\n428\n00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.400\nthat at that point because the court says\nI'm entitled to 10 years worth of data.\n\n429\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.240\nSo you gotta think about that, right.\n\n430\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.200\nSo data deletion procedures and\nmechanisms, we've talked a lot about\n\n431\n00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:37.446\nsafe disposal and the reasons and\nthe mechanisms and the ways to do that.\n\n432\n00:21:37.446 --> 00:21:40.470\nIf you remember,\non one of the prior shows,\n\n433\n00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.040\nwe had shown you a little snippet\nof the Google data center video.\n\n434\n00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.610\nAnd we will provide the URLT for\nthat, so you can look it up.\n\n435\n00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:48.770\nWe didn't show you the end of it, and\n\n436\n00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.330\nI didn't tell you about\nthe end of the video.\n\n437\n00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.550\nYou may not have watched it.\n\n438\n00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.310\nBut at the end of it you mentioned,\nyou've said you have seen hard\n\n439\n00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:57.530\ndrives dropped into a big shredder machine\nat a certain point in your career, so\n\n440\n00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.780\nthey actually show you the safe\ndisposal area inside the data center.\n\n441\n00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.450\nThey got one of the massive shredders,\nright.\n\n442\n00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.300\nThe big hammer mills that they have,\nthat they use.\n\n443\n00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.257\nSo they actually have somebody up on\nthe platform, with the safety glasses,\n\n444\n00:22:09.257 --> 00:22:10.330\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n445\n00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.030\nAnd they take the drive and\nthey drop it in the shredder.\n\n446\n00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.950\nAnd you see the pieces come\nflying out the back side.\n\n447\n00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.570\nAnd they show you the whole process.\n\n448\n00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.300\nShe's up there with the bar coder,\nscanning the drive to\n\n449\n00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:21.360\nidentify it as being removed from\ninventory, the whole nine yards.\n\n450\n00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:23.270\nThey actually show that to you\nin the back end of the video.\n\n451\n00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.770\nIt's out towards the very\nend of the video.\n\n452\n00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.947\n>> It's always fun to watch\n[CROSSTALK] destroyed.\n\n453\n00:22:26.947 --> 00:22:29.250\nIf you've never seen it or\ndone it you got to.\n\n454\n00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.583\n>> The tree guys on the side of the road,\nwith the big shredder and\n\n455\n00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:34.670\nthey're pulping all the bare,\nthey're shredding all the trees.\n\n456\n00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:35.330\nIt's kinda like that.\n\n457\n00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.890\nIt doesn't make the same noise,\nbut it's kinda like that.\n\n458\n00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:40.310\nAnd it just essentially shreds the drive.\n\n459\n00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.800\nWe do have a way for you to see that\nif you wanna take a look at that video.\n\n460\n00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.590\nIt's kinda cool.\n\n461\n00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:48.020\nBut safe disposal procedures are obviously\ngonna be very important as well.\n\n462\n00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.010\nMake sure we are, again, compliant and\n\n463\n00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:54.010\naligned there with whatever the regulatory\nand statutory requirements may be.\n\n464\n00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.850\nWe may or may not have statutory\nguidance we have to align with.\n\n465\n00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:58.280\nSo we do wanna be aware of that.\n\n466\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.990\nPhysical destruction,\nremember we talked about.\n\n467\n00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.190\nSo, things like shred the drive,\ndegaussing, right, so\n\n468\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.950\ngoing through with a strong magnetic\nfield, to be able to wipe out the drive.\n\n469\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.410\nOverwriting, as we talked about,\nseveral overwrites.\n\n470\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.090\nEncryption, may also be appropriate.\n\n471\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.911\n>> I like your thermite technique.\n\n472\n00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:14.452\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well that's, yeah that's an oldie but\n\n473\n00:23:14.452 --> 00:23:15.293\na goodie for the military.\n\n474\n00:23:15.293 --> 00:23:18.570\nIn a lot of these secure\ncommunication facilities,\n\n475\n00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:22.570\nespecially out in the field so\nyou look at NATO countries.\n\n476\n00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.620\nNorth South Korea's a good example of\nthis on the DMZ, at the time when we\n\n477\n00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:32.500\nstill have Eastern Europe Cold War thing\ngoing on and you had the Iron Curtain.\n\n478\n00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.850\nSo if you were in Berlin let's say and you\nweren't sitting in a divided Germany at\n\n479\n00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:40.700\na certain point, if you were sitting\nin a secure communication facility, and\n\n480\n00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.270\nyou were worried about the Soviets\ncoming across the border and\n\n481\n00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.890\npotentially attacking, you had to destroy\neverything that was sitting there\n\n482\n00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:48.520\nif there was even the hint\nthat that was gonna happen.\n\n483\n00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:50.120\nSame thing it creates to this day.\n\n484\n00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.778\nSo when you sit there with all this\ncomplicated, secure encryption gear,\n\n485\n00:23:53.778 --> 00:23:55.415\nit can't fall into enemy hands.\n\n486\n00:23:55.415 --> 00:23:56.842\nSo you've got thermite charges,\n\n487\n00:23:56.842 --> 00:23:59.805\ncuz that's the only thing that's\ngonna essentially melt this stuff.\n\n488\n00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:03.692\nYou got thermite charges strapped to the\nsides of these communication systems or\n\n489\n00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:06.777\nat least that are in the bunker or\nright there available to you and\n\n490\n00:24:06.777 --> 00:24:07.658\nyou have orders.\n\n491\n00:24:07.658 --> 00:24:09.200\nIf your alarm comes down and they say,\n\n492\n00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.370\nhey they are coming, you put the thermite\non there, you pull the pin and\n\n493\n00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:15.675\nyou just essentially leave, cuz you don't\nwanna be around and that stuff goes off.\n\n494\n00:24:15.675 --> 00:24:18.640\nSo this happens and\nthis continues to happen.\n\n495\n00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.650\nHappens in submarines,\n\n496\n00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.180\nyou got to scuttle a sub or give her the\ncommunication gear so it can't be taken.\n\n497\n00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.202\nThey've got destruction charters\nattached in all of these systems and\n\n498\n00:24:26.202 --> 00:24:29.622\nyou don't want to be around when they go\noff, because they're designed to shred\n\n499\n00:24:29.622 --> 00:24:32.216\neverything in that room and\nmake sure it's unrecoverable.\n\n500\n00:24:32.216 --> 00:24:35.275\nYou accordingly will be part of that\ndestruction if you happen to be\n\n501\n00:24:35.275 --> 00:24:36.047\nsitting there.\n\n502\n00:24:36.047 --> 00:24:41.225\nSo it is a pretty cool thing to see,\nif you've ever seen thermite being used.\n\n503\n00:24:41.225 --> 00:24:45.285\n[LAUGH] Go out and Google for thermite\ndestruction and you'll see there's all\n\n504\n00:24:45.285 --> 00:24:48.782\nthese videos of these crazy people\njust out there with thermite and\n\n505\n00:24:48.782 --> 00:24:51.970\njust attaching to anything\nthey can get their hands on.\n\n506\n00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:56.150\nAnd just you see it's basically like\nplasma, it melts anything it touches.\n\n507\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.380\nSo you see it on a solid steel three\ninch thick plate they set it off and\n\n508\n00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.080\nthe thing just goes right through it and\nit's just got a gaping hole and\n\n509\n00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.230\nit's just dripping metal.\n\n510\n00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:07.770\n>> Burns at like two or\nthree thousand degrees it's insane.\n\n511\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:08.980\nIt's very cool though.\n\n512\n00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.750\n>> It's crazy cool but also not the kind\nof thing you wanna play with right.\n\n513\n00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.260\nAbsolutely not.\n\n514\n00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.530\nSo, you could do any\nof that kind of stuff,\n\n515\n00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.630\nbut thermite is typically off\nthe table on the list of acceptable\n\n516\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.135\ndestruction mechanisms unless you work for\nthe government and have access to it.\n\n517\n00:25:21.135 --> 00:25:21.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Other than that,\n\n518\n00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.840\nprobably not gonna be on the list for\nthe average cloud security professional.\n\n519\n00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.950\nBut certainly,\nphysical destruction, degousing.\n\n520\n00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:30.090\nAn interesting little aside\nwith degousing I'll share with\n\n521\n00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.720\nyou just quickly one story from the field,\nif you will, right?\n\n522\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.130\nTales from the crypt of the data centers,\nand secure data centers I've been in.\n\n523\n00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:40.560\nSo there are many secure data centers I've\nbeen to where they have degaussers built\n\n524\n00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.350\nright into the frames of the doors that\nyou walk into the secure areas with or\n\n525\n00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.920\ninto certain cages.\n\n526\n00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.880\nAnd they are turned on normally, so\nthere's warning signs everywhere,\n\n527\n00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.000\nthey tell you in no uncertain terms,\ndegausser in use.\n\n528\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.350\nIf you have a pacemaker,\ndon't walk through there.\n\n529\n00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.580\nIf you've got any electronics on you,\nit will essentially wipe them clean.\n\n530\n00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.020\nYou don't wanna see what this\nthing does to a cell phone.\n\n531\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.010\nRight it will just destroy your display.\n\n532\n00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.030\nBut it wipes out your credit cards,\nyou name it, whatever it is.\n\n533\n00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:11.430\nBut it is designed specifically to prevent\nyou from walking through that field and\n\n534\n00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.300\ncarrying in or\nout electronic data of any kind.\n\n535\n00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.350\nThey'd They'd rather wipe it out than\nrisk you either taking in or out and\n\n536\n00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.900\nessentially ruining and\nproviding an ability for\n\n537\n00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.086\nyou to blow a path to\nconfidentiality protection.\n\n538\n00:26:22.086 --> 00:26:25.160\nSo they built degausser\nright into the frames, and\n\n539\n00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.260\nyou have to have an exception to turn\nthat thing off and walk through it.\n\n540\n00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:30.160\nSo when we do maintenance\nin these systems,\n\n541\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.060\nyou've got to get them to turn that off to\nbring the drives in and to swap out and\n\n542\n00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.860\ndo this kind of stuff, or\nthe drives essentially are wiped.\n\n543\n00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.400\nAnd so it's really, it's a big deal.\n\n544\n00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.450\nBut they're kind of cool.\n\n545\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:41.060\nThey make this incredible\nhumming noise too.\n\n546\n00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.970\nWhich is just, this low\n>> It's like an MRI.\n\n547\n00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.400\n>> Really powerful, yeah.\n\n548\n00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.260\nI worked in radio and\nI was in the music business.\n\n549\n00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.250\nYou wouldn't know by looking at me that I\nwas ever in the music business because I'm\n\n550\n00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:53.080\nso clean cut and I have no signs at all\nand were out with it, I was doing this.\n\n551\n00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.470\nBut years ago when I was in the music\nbusiness before I grew up and\n\n552\n00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.990\ndecided to get a day job,\nright, that actually paid well.\n\n553\n00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.920\nWhen I was running radio stations,\nI did that for a while, and I was DJing,\n\n554\n00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.900\ndid all sorts of stuff.\n\n555\n00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.350\nWe actually had back then,\nthey still use them I think,\n\n556\n00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:11.040\ncarts which were the eight track tapes you\nwould use to record drops and 5, 10, 20,\n\n557\n00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.640\n30 second, three or four minute music.\n\n558\n00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.140\nDrops.\n\n559\n00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.080\nYou'd put them on carts and you had\na machine that would record them, and\n\n560\n00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.260\nyou had a degausser that\nwould wipe them clean.\n\n561\n00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.295\nAnd so you'd put it in there, hit\nthe button, and it was like one of those\n\n562\n00:27:21.295 --> 00:27:24.350\nsci-fi movies on Saturday night\nwhere the lights would dim and\n\n563\n00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.500\nyou'd hear all the noise and\neverything would kind of rumble.\n\n564\n00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.790\nBecause a degausser is just\nthis huge electromagnet\n\n565\n00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.210\nthat essentially is\nwiping everything clean.\n\n566\n00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:34.370\nIt takes tremendous power\nto run one of these things.\n\n567\n00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.020\nSo it's kind of scary,\nright, when you turn it on?\n\n568\n00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:38.090\nBut they're kind of cool.\n\n569\n00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.390\nSo, encryption is also\na pretty good way to do this.\n\n570\n00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:43.200\nI think at some point in .one of the prior\nepisodes I mentioned crypto-shredding.\n\n571\n00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.830\nCrypto-shredding the idea of encrypting\nthe remnant data left behind.\n\n572\n00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:52.400\nSo unencrypting the data and then\nre-encrypting with a new set of keys and\n\n573\n00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.230\na new algorithm.\n\n574\n00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.550\nSeparating as we've talked\nabout the keys and the data.\n\n575\n00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.700\nSo you essentially leave behind encrypted\ndata that's been encrypted with a new\n\n576\n00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.340\nset of keys and you destroy the encryption\nkey so that way the data and\n\n577\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.110\nthe key can never be\nbrought back together.\n\n578\n00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.910\nSo you are purposely leaving the data\nthere, but you are shredding the data.\n\n579\n00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.750\nYou are making it unaccessible or\ninaccessible,\n\n580\n00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:15.240\nbecause unless the key is rediscovered or\nfound, that key will no longer be usable.\n\n581\n00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.460\nAnd so, as a result of that, when we just\nliterally destroyed the encryption key,\n\n582\n00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.120\nwe're rending the data\ntypically unrecoverable.\n\n583\n00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.110\nThis is the process of crypto-shredding.\n\n584\n00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:27.230\nAnd we talked about this as well as\nbeing accepted way to destroy data.\n\n585\n00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.600\nSo data archiving procedures and\nmechanisms are very important for\n\n586\n00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.570\nus to think about.\n\n587\n00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.140\nAs CCSP's we really have to\ndrive though the documentation\n\n588\n00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.640\nmechanisms associated with\nusing these technologies.\n\n589\n00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.820\nWe have to drive through the policy the\nprocedure and the process the training and\n\n590\n00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:46.500\nthe recertification and re validation\nof the protection mechanisms under our\n\n591\n00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:50.710\ncare and control, but we have to partner\nwith the cloud providers in order to do\n\n592\n00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.630\nthis in order to ensure that the proper\nlevel of protections are being provided.\n\n593\n00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:59.140\nThis is all gonna be very important for\nus to consider as we also want to\n\n594\n00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.430\nincorporate and talk about here in the\nlast few minutes we have In this episode,\n\n595\n00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:06.430\nthe processes around designing and\nimplementing auditability, traceablity,\n\n596\n00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.190\nand accountability for data events.\n\n597\n00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.030\nWe've talked a lot about auditability and\ntraceability and\n\n598\n00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.830\naccountability, this is something we\nspend a lot of time talking about.\n\n599\n00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:18.040\nBut the concept of a data event is\npretty much anything that happens\n\n600\n00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:21.070\nwith regards to data that\nwe're gonna log and/or record.\n\n601\n00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.190\nSo we wanna answer the who, what,\nand when, where, why, and how.\n\n602\n00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.470\nFive W's and the H questions around\nthe events, and data associated with them,\n\n603\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.710\nshould, support and stipulate,\nthe pertinent information about this.\n\n604\n00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.670\nAnd if we capture all that and understand\nthat, it allows us to be able to then,\n\n605\n00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.430\nreally authoritatively, interact with, and\n\n606\n00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.810\nunderstand the kind of data,\ntha we are gathering.\n\n607\n00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:45.760\nThe importance of it and the management of\nthat data so then we then understand how\n\n608\n00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.880\nto apply not only protections, but\nthrough analysis extract value.\n\n609\n00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.460\nAnd so this is very important.\n\n610\n00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:55.524\nStorage and analysis of data then in other\nwords it becomes a central focal point for\n\n611\n00:29:55.524 --> 00:29:56.871\nsecurity professionals.\n\n612\n00:29:56.871 --> 00:29:58.560\nWe, excuse me.\n\n613\n00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.170\nWe talk about SIEM systems,\nsecurity information and\n\n614\n00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.460\nevent management systems,\nthe ability to aggregate log data from\n\n615\n00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:08.570\nmultiple systems together into one\ncentral system for dashboarding,\n\n616\n00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.520\nBI, data analytics, data visualization,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n617\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.260\nWe talk about taking event data and\nusing it to drive response.\n\n618\n00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:21.310\nSo IDPS systems, intrusion detection,\nand prevention systems\n\n619\n00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:24.970\nthat are gonna be able to do real\ntime heuristical analysis of data.\n\n620\n00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.040\nIn line, in stream realtime data\nanalysis and then take on and\n\n621\n00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.760\nprobably reconfigure the system and\nengage in some sort of logging as well as\n\n622\n00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.180\nresponse action in real time\ncan be driven by these systems.\n\n623\n00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.680\nSo the preservation of\ndata is very important.\n\n624\n00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.600\nThe foundational elements\nof preservation of data\n\n625\n00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.570\nare your time stamping to\nunderstand when the data occurred.\n\n626\n00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:48.840\nIntegrity checks and controls to\nmake sure that data is not modified\n\n627\n00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.470\nwithout our knowledge and\nor without our permission.\n\n628\n00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.940\nSo change management and\nintegrity controls become very important.\n\n629\n00:30:54.940 --> 00:31:02.345\nThere is an ISO standard, ISO 27037,\n2-7-0-3-7, that You should look at,\n\n630\n00:31:02.345 --> 00:31:07.265\nwith regards to forensics, and with\nregards to data preservation in the cloud.\n\n631\n00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:10.435\nIt's one of the acknowledged\nISO standards that's out there,\n\n632\n00:31:10.435 --> 00:31:14.050\nspecifically with regards to storage and\nanalysis of data and events.\n\n633\n00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:18.820\nRelated to data that we should\nbe aware of, the CCSPs,\n\n634\n00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.440\nISO 27037 will be very important.\n\n635\n00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.530\nActually while we're talking,\ncan you Google ISO 27037 for me?\n\n636\n00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.450\nI wanna show all of you guys something\nout there about ISO standards,\n\n637\n00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:30.290\nit's really important for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n638\n00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.350\nDaniel's gonna do this for us on the fly.\n\n639\n00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.060\nCuz, yet again, as is usually the case,\nI had a brain storm as we're talking and\n\n640\n00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.550\nI did not prepare him for\nthe opportunity to do this ahead of time.\n\n641\n00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.280\nSo, what you will find is typically\nseveral references probably.\n\n642\n00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.460\nLook for one that is going to\nreference the ISO catalog so\n\n643\n00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.060\nthat we can actually bring it up.\n\n644\n00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:50.799\nMaybe you and I can collaborate here for\nhalf a second real quick.\n\n645\n00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:53.980\nI'm going to step off camera and you're\ngoing to see me just as a half person.\n\n646\n00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.688\nI'm going to do this.\n\n647\n00:31:54.688 --> 00:31:55.304\n>> [LAUGH] Hey there we are.\n\n648\n00:31:55.304 --> 00:31:56.422\n>> There we are.\nSo yes exactly,\n\n649\n00:31:56.422 --> 00:31:57.828\nI want you to show that, yeah.\n\n650\n00:31:57.828 --> 00:31:58.479\nBring that up.\n\n651\n00:31:58.479 --> 00:32:00.568\nSo I wanna make sure we're showing\nyou the right site for this.\n\n652\n00:32:00.568 --> 00:32:03.317\nIf we can go to Daniel's\nscreen real quick, so\n\n653\n00:32:03.317 --> 00:32:07.122\nwhat we're gonna see is that ISO\nas an organization has all these\n\n654\n00:32:07.122 --> 00:32:11.870\nstandards online in form that allows\nyou to actually see a preview of them.\n\n655\n00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:14.550\nThe problem is that in order to read\nthe full standard you typically\n\n656\n00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:15.530\nhave to buy it.\n\n657\n00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.790\nSo the good news is we don't expect you\nto read the full standard in order to be\n\n658\n00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.750\ncertified we're not gonna ask you detailed\nquestions on any one of these standards.\n\n659\n00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.600\nBut rather, just general awareness of what\nthe standard is, what it represents, and\n\n660\n00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.380\nwhy it's important would be good.\n\n661\n00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.710\nBut you can see there we do typically\nhave the ability to see the forward,\n\n662\n00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:31.940\ntypically the table of contents.\n\n663\n00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.170\nYou can see the items that\nare associated with it,\n\n664\n00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.230\nalthough you'll see they're grayed out.\n\n665\n00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.220\nYou typically can't click through them and\nsee them, you're gonna see the name, and\n\n666\n00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:41.800\nyou may get a summary as well\nthe appendix at the back that shows\n\n667\n00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.260\nyou some documentation.\n\n668\n00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.700\nBut you'll see they do\ngive you a nice overview.\n\n669\n00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.970\nYou can buy it there if you need to.\n\n670\n00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.520\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n671\n00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.780\nWe do wanna know that evidence\npreservation is important for\n\n672\n00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.030\nthings like chain of custody, certainly,\nbut also to make sure that the information\n\n673\n00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:59.100\nthat is gathered would be applicable and\npresentable in a court of law.\n\n674\n00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.330\nSo this is also very important for\nus to consider.\n\n675\n00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:03.360\nSo standards like this\nbecome very valuable.\n\n676\n00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.590\nWe've talked about security and\n\n677\n00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.695\ninformation event management systems,\nSEM systems and why they are important.\n\n678\n00:33:08.695 --> 00:33:11.160\nTheir capabilities are very broad ranging.\n\n679\n00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.950\nYou're gonna have data aggregation\nas I said correlation, learning,\n\n680\n00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.960\ndashboarding, all these capabilities,\nas well as forensics analysis typically\n\n681\n00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.050\nwill exist in these systems, and\ncontinuous operations, meaning continuous\n\n682\n00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:27.440\nmonitoring of data is also stipulated in\npart of the thought process we have here.\n\n683\n00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.930\nAudit logging, contract and\nauthority maintenance.\n\n684\n00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:33.680\nSo, we're looking at the contracts we're\nreviewing them on a regular basis.\n\n685\n00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.810\nData governments being brought to bare,\nand\n\n686\n00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:39.360\nsend a response and all these things\nare part of continuous operation, and\n\n687\n00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:42.565\ncontinuous monitoring thought processes,\nso we do want to be aware of that.\n\n688\n00:33:42.565 --> 00:33:46.415\nWe've talked a bit about chain of custody\nof evidence and making sure we can\n\n689\n00:33:46.415 --> 00:33:50.285\nauthoritatively stipulate and specify\nwhere evidence has been from the time it\n\n690\n00:33:50.285 --> 00:33:53.960\nwas discovered, through the time it is\nanalyzed, and hopefully the time it either\n\n691\n00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.370\nshows up at trial and/or is given back\nto the owner when we no longer need it.\n\n692\n00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:02.290\nSo we have to understand how to implement\nchain of custody and also non-repudiation.\n\n693\n00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:06.336\nThe ability to understand ultimately\nthat evidence is gonna emanate from\n\n694\n00:34:06.336 --> 00:34:10.068\nsomebody and that we can't deny\nhaving created that information.\n\n695\n00:34:10.068 --> 00:34:12.468\nOr can't deny having done something,\nright?\n\n696\n00:34:12.468 --> 00:34:16.609\nSo non-repudiation and proof margin\nare also very important in order for\n\n697\n00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:19.758\nevidence to be considered\nadmissible in court.\n\n698\n00:34:19.758 --> 00:34:22.790\nThat documentation has to\nbe essentially created and\n\n699\n00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:26.130\nthe chain of evidence,\nchain of custody has to be maintained.\n\n700\n00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:31.040\nSo we have to understand that we should\nhave documentation around possession,\n\n701\n00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.060\naround condition, location,\n\n702\n00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:37.830\ntransfer, access during the time that that\ndata's been under care, and analysis,\n\n703\n00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.830\nso we should keep records of all of this,\nto establish chain of custody, provide for\n\n704\n00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:45.390\nnon repudiation, and to ensure\nadmissibility, in a court of law.\n\n705\n00:34:45.390 --> 00:34:49.450\nWhether it's in the cloud or not, this\nis standard security 101 kind of stuff.\n\n706\n00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.740\nBut when we add the word cloud to it,\nit may become more complicated as you\n\n707\n00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:58.260\nremember because you may not always have\ncomplete control over all of the data\n\n708\n00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.010\nduring all elements of the life cycle,\nwe may have to rely on the third party\n\n709\n00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:06.770\ncloud service provider or their designated\nrepresentative to provide that to us.\n\n710\n00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.730\nAnd forensically, it may be very hard for\nus to examine data and\n\n711\n00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.160\ngain access to it, because we may not\nhave control of the back end systems.\n\n712\n00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.700\nSo we may have to rely on the third party\ncloud provider to actually engage in\n\n713\n00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.260\nthe forensic analysis for us, and then\npresent the data to us after the fact.\n\n714\n00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:24.370\nSo there's a lot of kind of challenging\nconditions we have to deal with here\n\n715\n00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:28.990\nas CCSPs, as we think about these areas\nand as we kind of wrap up our conversation\n\n716\n00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:33.750\nin this episode overall with regards to\nthe data events, and accountability, and\n\n717\n00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.600\ntransactions, and looking at\ntraceability and retention periods, and\n\n718\n00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.160\nall this stuff we've been talking about.\n\n719\n00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.400\nIt's not as simple as just saying,\nyeah, we'll go get that.\n\n720\n00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.160\nWe'll have a record of it.\n\n721\n00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.110\nWe'll keep it here.\n\n722\n00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:46.370\nWe may have to partner with other\npeople to do that, or other entities.\n\n723\n00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.920\nWe have to rely on them and create trust\nin order to understand the limits of what\n\n724\n00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:53.330\nwe can get from them and under what\nconditions those things will be provided.\n\n725\n00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.320\nSo it could be a very,\n\n726\n00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.560\nvery involved thought process that we\nengage in ultimately to do these things.\n\n727\n00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.060\n>> Well Adam, we have many avenues and\nconsiderations that we have to take into\n\n728\n00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:06.250\naccount when it comes to data management\nas an overall idea and implementation and\n\n729\n00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:10.640\nyou've done a really good job of actually\ntaking us through all the major big boys,\n\n730\n00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:14.270\nespecially when it comes to,\ndon't forget that retention, deletion,\n\n731\n00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.820\narchival, keeping that data secure,\n\n732\n00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:20.500\nthe integrity of it,\nif I do have to transfer ownership of it.\n\n733\n00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.560\nDon't forget your chain of custody.\n\n734\n00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.300\nThere's all sorts of audit-ability and\n\n735\n00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.630\naccountability that we have to take into\naccount when we are working with our data.\n\n736\n00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:31.290\nAnd the good thing is if you feel\nlike this is a lot of information,\n\n737\n00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.540\nwell you're right, it is.\n\n738\n00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.690\nAnd the good thing is, is that this is\na recording so you can watch it over and\n\n739\n00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:39.790\nover and over again until the information\nthat came out of this man.\n\n740\n00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:44.580\n[LAUGH] Being it gets into your being and\nthen you able to go, take an exam,\n\n741\n00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.840\npass it and feel confident that you\nknow these topics very very well so\n\n742\n00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.660\ndo that if it didn't\nfeel little overwhelming?\n\n743\n00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.010\nDo watch these episodes over and\nover and over again.\n\n744\n00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:58.510\nAnd you will eventually retain we do\nsay repetition breeds retention right?\n\n745\n00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.804\n>> Well this is just like a soft cuddly\nwarm blanket it gets more comfortable\n\n746\n00:37:01.804 --> 00:37:02.580\nevery time.\n\n747\n00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.350\n>> It does do that.\n\n748\n00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:08.810\nI'm the kind of person I do have to do\nthat I have to continually reassess and\n\n749\n00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:12.700\nreanalyze the data over and over again so\nthat I can retain it for myself so-\n\n750\n00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.240\n>> What were you saying?\n\n751\n00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:13.981\nI wasn't paying attention.\n\n752\n00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:14.996\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I should rewind that and-\n\n753\n00:37:14.996 --> 00:37:16.046\n>> That's right, hit the rewind button.\n\n754\n00:37:16.046 --> 00:37:16.790\n>> Remember that?\n[LAUGH]\n\n755\n00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.440\n>> All right Adam it looks like we've\n\n756\n00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.880\nwrapped up yet another great episode.\n\n757\n00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.250\nWe do appreciate your time and\ninformation and expertise.\n\n758\n00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.750\nWe do appreciate you guys joining us,\nand hopefully learning something,\n\n759\n00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.740\nwe are gonna go ahead and sign off, for IT\nPro TV, I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n760\n00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.490\n>> And I have been your host,\nI don't know.\n\n761\n00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:35.356\nWhoever I am.\n>> Data retention.\n\n762\n00:37:35.356 --> 00:37:36.500\n[LAUGH]\n>> Data retention, there you go.\n\n763\n00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.110\nI couldn't remember what I was,\nhad to review.\n\n764\n00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:39.200\n>> That's right.\n\n765\n00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:42.090\n>> We'll see you soon guys,\ncome back and see us again.\n\n766\n00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.506\n>> See you next time.\n>> Take care.\n\n767\n00:37:44.506 --> 00:37:51.750\n[SOUND]\n\n",

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:17.840\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.320\nAnd in today's episode we\nare continuing on with our\n\n5\n00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.800\nCertified Cloud Security Professional\nseries.\n\n6\n00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.080\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday is a man that can divide by zero,\n\n7\n00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.980\nthat is our good friend Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.470\nAdam Gordon, Adam welcome back to\nthe show how's it going today?\n\n9\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.179\n>> I resemble that remark and\n\n10\n00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.847\nI refuse to talk about things that\nare not full numerical equivalents.\n\n11\n00:00:35.847 --> 00:00:36.990\n>> That's right.\n\n12\n00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.200\n>> So everything is good, everything is\ngood, hopefully it's good with all of you,\n\n13\n00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.580\nwe are as Daniel said going to continue\nour conversation with regards to cloud.\n\n14\n00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.440\nWe've talked a lot in prior\nepisodes about the cloud overall,\n\n15\n00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.340\nspent a whole bunch of time laying out\nthe foundational elements of cloud,\n\n16\n00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.890\ntalking about the roles, talking about\nthe thought processes associated with it,\n\n17\n00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.130\nalso talking about the ways\nin which we should envision\n\n18\n00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.530\nthe cloud as an IT professional,\nas a security professional.\n\n19\n00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.590\nAnd we've talked a lot about risk,\nwith regards to data, and\n\n20\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.850\nthe role the data plays,\nin terms of our ability to manage, but\n\n21\n00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.000\nalso our ability to use, and\nto operate resources within the cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.120\nWe wanna switch our attention a little\nbit, in this series of episodes, and\n\n23\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.200\ntalk about, cloud infrastructure.\n\n24\n00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.470\nWe'll talk about data certainly,\nwe circle back to that.\n\n25\n00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.940\nThink about risk, and all the things\nthat we have to be concerned with, but\n\n26\n00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.740\nwe have to start broadening\nour approach a little bit,\n\n27\n00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.730\nthinking about the infrastructure that\nruns underneath the hood, so to speak.\n\n28\n00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.070\nSo when we think about IaaS,\nwe think about PaaS, we think about SaaS,\n\n29\n00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.825\nour service models, we've talked a lot\nabout the fact that we are borrowing or\n\n30\n00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:41.755\nrenting this infrastructure,\nthis network infrastructure, the storage\n\n31\n00:01:41.755 --> 00:01:46.525\ninfrastructure, the compute resources,\nthe CPU and the memory of the host.\n\n32\n00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:50.105\nBut we haven't really spent a lot of\ntime on what that ultimately means,\n\n33\n00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:52.895\nhow we're gonna configure that,\nwhat we're gonna do to manage it.\n\n34\n00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.185\nWe've spoken about the hypervisors and\ntalked about type one and\n\n35\n00:01:56.185 --> 00:01:57.525\ntype two hypervisors.\n\n36\n00:01:57.525 --> 00:02:01.030\nWe've spoken about the concept\nof guest operating systems or\n\n37\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.780\nvirtual machines running on\ntop of a host infrastructure.\n\n38\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.400\nBut, we haven't really\nbrought all that together.\n\n39\n00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.130\nSo, in this set of discussions,\nwe're gonna attempt to do just that.\n\n40\n00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.540\nI'll speak a little about the broader\nelements of cloud, the building blocks and\n\n41\n00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.490\nthe scaffling that we essentially\nbuild the cloud upon and\n\n42\n00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.470\ntry to put that in perspective for you.\n\n43\n00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.400\nAnd if we don't do that then I'm gonna\nshow you how to make the perfect cup of\n\n44\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.060\nespresso, so either way we're gonna\nhave something cool to take away\n\n45\n00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.540\nat the end of this conversation.\n\n46\n00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.200\nBut let's try to talk about the cloud and\nsee if we can get that out of the way\n\n47\n00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.440\nfirst, cuz of the two espresso's actually\na lot harder to do than the cloud.\n\n48\n00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.440\nSo hopefully you'll be in a good place,\nand\n\n49\n00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.530\nhave a good cup of coffee\nalso while we're done.\n\n50\n00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.060\nSo when we think about\nthe concepts of the cloud, and\n\n51\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.670\nwe think about the concepts of\ninfrastructure, what we have to do and\n\n52\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.230\nwe've talked about this several times,\nis we have to really reach backwards and\n\n53\n00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.690\nwhen I talk about reaching backwards what\nI mean is we have to look at what happens\n\n54\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.710\noutside the cloud in the physical world\nand understand that the things that we\n\n55\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.130\ntalk about there that get translated\ninto the cloud for the most part not\n\n56\n00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.940\nidentically but almost for\nthe most part are going to be the same.\n\n57\n00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.590\nAnd so when we put the word cloud in front\nof the management process say we're gonna\n\n58\n00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.540\nmanage the cloud, or cloud management.\n\n59\n00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.216\nWe're thinking about management and\nthinking about the ability\n\n60\n00:03:16.216 --> 00:03:20.957\nto deploy management software, or in the\nlanguage of management, the data plane,\n\n61\n00:03:20.957 --> 00:03:23.453\nthe management plane, the control plane.\n\n62\n00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:27.876\nWe're thinking about how we're going\nto deploy management capabilities to\n\n63\n00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:32.232\nunderstand remotely interact with,\nassess, continuously monitor, and\n\n64\n00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:35.650\nultimately optimize and\nmaintain cloud infrastructure.\n\n65\n00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.470\nAnd so we have management software.\n\n66\n00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.050\nAnd on top of whatever operating\nsystems we run, on top of whatever\n\n67\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.480\nvirtualization we do, we have to\nhave the capability to reach out and\n\n68\n00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.800\ncoordinate centrally and\ncontrol these infrastructure items.\n\n69\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.620\nAnd so we deploy management software.\n\n70\n00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.250\nWe have virtualization software,\nmost likely.\n\n71\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.580\nWe talked about the fact that we can\nvirtualize outside of the cloud and\n\n72\n00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.990\nessentially have stand alone\nvirtualization infrastructure\n\n73\n00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.650\nthat doesn't have to be\nlinked to the cloud.\n\n74\n00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.150\nBut we've also spoken about the fact\nthat to do cloud today based on\n\n75\n00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.100\nthe acceptable definitions that\nwe speak about the 800 145\n\n76\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.680\n145 cloud computing definition,\nthat we've referred to many\n\n77\n00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.320\ntimes in our prior sessions or\nprior episodes together, that, in order to\n\n78\n00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.830\nmeet our five characteristics that define\nthe cloud and really have them and\n\n79\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.520\nreally understand how to differentiate,\nwe would need virtualization.\n\n80\n00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.620\nIt would be impossible to achieve the\nnormal things we think about with cloud\n\n81\n00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.140\ncomputing today without virtualization\ntechnology and so, while we can virtualize\n\n82\n00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.950\nwithout the cloud, we really can't\nhave cloud without virtualization.\n\n83\n00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.440\nAnd because of that, we have to\nthink about virtualization software.\n\n84\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.470\nWhat is going to be\nthe virtualization platform\n\n85\n00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.500\nreally doesn't matter from\nour perspective, as a CCSP.\n\n86\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.150\nWe should be able to operate and\nshould be able to interact and\n\n87\n00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.420\nmanage and secure infrastructure\nregardless of vendor specification.\n\n88\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.230\nSo whether it's Microsoft whether it's\nVMware, whether it is going to be\n\n89\n00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.620\nthe Citrix platform with Zen or Zen Sever,\nwhatever the virtualization stack may\n\n90\n00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.040\nbe we should be able to have\nthe same fundamental concept supply.\n\n91\n00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.180\nWe should be able to understand and\nmanage risk.\n\n92\n00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.270\nWe should be able to understand\nperformance based monitoring so\n\n93\n00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.030\nthat we can understand what's happening in\nthe system, make sure we don't over-commit\n\n94\n00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.860\nour resources or under consumer\nresources that are being provided so\n\n95\n00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.580\nthat we're spending more money\nthan we actually need to or\n\n96\n00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.120\nwasting resources when we don't need them\nto be a portioned out maybe taking them\n\n97\n00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.030\naway from another resource area where\nthey could do more good, right.\n\n98\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.212\nAnd ultimately balance those resource\nconcerns because although we don't think\n\n99\n00:05:43.212 --> 00:05:46.970\nabout performance and performance\nmonitoring as an essential element of\n\n100\n00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.241\nsecurity, it really does sit at\nthe heart of what we talk about,\n\n101\n00:05:50.241 --> 00:05:52.908\nbecause if we don't pay\nattention to performance,\n\n102\n00:05:52.908 --> 00:05:57.220\nwe may wind up with a situation where we\nhave a resource concern or constraint.\n\n103\n00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.874\nAnd that can lead to lack of\nperformance and maybe even,\n\n104\n00:05:59.874 --> 00:06:03.094\nnot just lack of performance,but\nmay actually lead to a denial, or\n\n105\n00:06:03.094 --> 00:06:06.934\ndistributed denial of service event,\nwhich is directly related to security and\n\n106\n00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:10.433\nthings that you and I and ultimately\nanybody who goes through security and\n\n107\n00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:13.171\nunderstands how to deal with\nit would be concerned with.\n\n108\n00:06:13.171 --> 00:06:17.346\nAnd so resource allocation, resource\nmanagement is certainly part of ultimately\n\n109\n00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:21.219\nwhat we have to think about with regards\nto security even though it might not be\n\n110\n00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:23.088\nsomething traditionally, right?\n\n111\n00:06:23.088 --> 00:06:25.600\nWe say, security,\nwe're definitely gonna do that.\n\n112\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.840\nWe're going to perform the automize\nbecause that is something I must do.\n\n113\n00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.750\nWhen I talk to customers about security,\nwhen I speak to them\n\n114\n00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.400\nabout the needs to understand\ntheir operational environment and\n\n115\n00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.850\ncreate that operational or situational\nawareness that I have mentioned in\n\n116\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.090\na couple of different instances with you,\nwe think broadly about that statement,\n\n117\n00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.070\nand really have to understand\nthe touches of variety of things.\n\n118\n00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.840\nI make the case with\ncustomers that automation and\n\n119\n00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.680\nsoftware definition is part of\na good defense and death posture.\n\n120\n00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.360\nBecause if you can do those things and\n\n121\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.620\nunderstand how to deploy these\ntechnologies today, you're going to be\n\n122\n00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.500\na lot more likely to understand\nhow to manage risks successfully,\n\n123\n00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.630\nbecause you're going to have a very\nrobust change management process.\n\n124\n00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.770\nYou're gonna have a very well-defined\nbaseline and set of expectations for\n\n125\n00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:10.730\nperformance.\n\n126\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.940\nYou're gonna remove the human, so to\nspeak, from the mix as often as possible.\n\n127\n00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.830\nAutomation will allow you to\ntake on repetitious activities\n\n128\n00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.060\nthat are monotonous.\n\n129\n00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.052\nAnd in theory, if you do it the right way,\nyou vet it and\n\n130\n00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:27.290\nyou ensure that the automation is\nsuccessful, to repeat those activities,\n\n131\n00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.354\nessentially as often as needed,\nwithout the concern or\n\n132\n00:07:30.354 --> 00:07:34.265\nthe fear that somebody will make\na mistake at some point along the way and\n\n133\n00:07:34.265 --> 00:07:38.608\npropagate that error into the system and\ncreate all sorts of chaos as a result.\n\n134\n00:07:38.608 --> 00:07:42.748\nWe call that in cryptography, the\navalanche effect, where we have a small,\n\n135\n00:07:42.748 --> 00:07:47.145\nlittle error in one place that because of\nx-oring or continuing to propagate that\n\n136\n00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:51.480\nerror through multiple iterations,\nultimately becomes a magnified event that\n\n137\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.970\ncould cause catastrophic consequences,\nat least with regards to cryptography.\n\n138\n00:07:55.970 --> 00:08:00.194\nWe talk about it as the butterfly effect\ngenerically, in project management,\n\n139\n00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:03.849\nwith chaos theory where butterfly\nflaps its wings in the Amazon, and\n\n140\n00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:06.480\nall of a sudden you have\ntidal waves in Japan.\n\n141\n00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.700\nAs a series of interrelated\nresults that we can look at,\n\n142\n00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.720\nas one output of a process\nbecomes the input of the next.\n\n143\n00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.940\nWe move that error and\nthat concern forward, growing it, and\n\n144\n00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.370\namplifying it as we go.\n\n145\n00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.440\nSo we have to think about these kind\nof things that are lateral to security.\n\n146\n00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.145\nThe good CCSP as opposed to the bad CCSP.\n\n147\n00:08:25.145 --> 00:08:28.150\nSo, total random aside here, we're gonna\ngo to the movie thought process for\n\n148\n00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:29.800\na second, talking about good and the bad.\n\n149\n00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.450\nSo, I know you and I have chatted about\nmovies before, and I know, Daniel,\n\n150\n00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.310\nthat you have a depth of movie reservoir\nknowledge that you draw on the way I do.\n\n151\n00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.030\nBut did you ever see\na movie called Wizards?\n\n152\n00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:43.080\n>> I wanna say yes.\n\n153\n00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.300\n>> Animated feature, right?\n\n154\n00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:46.030\nConcept of good and bad?\n\n155\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.642\nIt was a cult,\nit is a cult film kind of classic, but\n\n156\n00:08:49.642 --> 00:08:55.420\nI think Ralph Bakshi was the guy who did\nthe direction on the animation on it.\n\n157\n00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:58.663\nIt was a great, it is,\nnot just was, is a great movie.\n\n158\n00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.973\nBut it's the quintessential\ngood versus evil,\n\n159\n00:09:01.973 --> 00:09:07.150\ngood versus bad dialogue in the movies\ndone in an animated feature fashion.\n\n160\n00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.840\nIt was not the same kind of animation\nas Heavy Metal, wasn't quite like that.\n\n161\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.760\nWe've all probably, most of us anyway,\nhave seen or heard about Heavy Metal.\n\n162\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.400\nIt's a slightly different take on things,\nbut it's a very similar concept, right?\n\n163\n00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.110\nThe struggle between good and evil, two\nwizards, brothers, one good, one bad who\n\n164\n00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:30.300\nessentially fight it out in a technology\napocalyptic landscape in the future.\n\n165\n00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.240\nAnd it's just a really, really good movie.\n\n166\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.860\nIf you haven't seen it, you gotta go\nspend 90 minutes and just watch it.\n\n167\n00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.530\nIt's an awesome movie and\nreally has no direct\n\n168\n00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.240\nbearing at all on what we're talking\nabout, so we're just gonna continue with\n\n169\n00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.090\nthe stuff we're actually here to do today,\nand we'll pretend that never happens.\n\n170\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:45.780\n>> Random aside.\n\n171\n00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.330\n>> Random aside.\n\n172\n00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We should have\n\n173\n00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.820\njust a flash that goes up saying,\nrandom aside, and\n\n174\n00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.160\njust you have five minutes of nothingness,\nand then we go back to talking.\n\n175\n00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.680\nSo anyway, the point with the good and\n\n176\n00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.180\nbad concept is we have to\nthink outside the box, really.\n\n177\n00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.436\nAs good CCSPs, as good security\nprofessionals, even more broadly than just\n\n178\n00:10:02.436 --> 00:10:06.102\nout beyond the cloud,\nas individuals that understand security,\n\n179\n00:10:06.102 --> 00:10:08.852\nunderstand the concepts\nassociated with it, and\n\n180\n00:10:08.852 --> 00:10:12.582\npractice it in the right way every day,\nwe really have to think about\n\n181\n00:10:12.582 --> 00:10:15.410\nthe enterprise-wide\nimplications of what we do.\n\n182\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.030\nI often talk about the concept of\nenterprise security architecture\n\n183\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.640\nwith customers, with students.\n\n184\n00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.690\nBecause a security practitioner,\nsomebody who understands security, and\n\n185\n00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.150\ncan really guide a company through the ins\nand outs of implementing securely,\n\n186\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.240\nis gonna understand that they have to\nhave a broad focus and a broad brush\n\n187\n00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.930\nto essentially lay out, and create the\npicture, and the borders and parameters of\n\n188\n00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:44.410\nwhat security may mean out beyond a single\nsystem, out beyond a single interface, but\n\n189\n00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.370\nrather across the enterprise,\nthe breadth and the depth of what we do.\n\n190\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.160\nBecause there's risk everywhere and\nif we're not managing those concerns,\n\n191\n00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.660\neither pushing them back by\nestablishing very specific enclave or\n\n192\n00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.580\nprotection boundaries, and then saying\ninside we're doing this and outside we're\n\n193\n00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.920\nexpecting these bad things to occur, we're\nessentially allowing undefined areas of\n\n194\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.950\nour network to dictate our lowest common\ndenominator from a security standpoint.\n\n195\n00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.590\nAnd because of that, we are allowing\nsecurity to be dictated by the bad\n\n196\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.020\nactors and the randomness of risk,\nas opposed to through defining\n\n197\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.780\nwhat the baseline expectations will be,\nand then managing to those expectations.\n\n198\n00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.830\nSo we have to think about the fact\nthat management software's important.\n\n199\n00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.110\nVirtualization software,\nrunning on top of the hosts\n\n200\n00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.230\nas some sort of operating system with an\nembedded hypervisor or an operating system\n\n201\n00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.970\nwith an additional application-based\nhypervisor running on top of it.\n\n202\n00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:42.678\nWhich provides the abstraction\ncapabilities for the networking, storage,\n\n203\n00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:43.604\nCPU and RAM, or\n\n204\n00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:47.825\nthe four essential food groups of\nvirtualization that we talk about.\n\n205\n00:11:47.825 --> 00:11:52.081\nAnd then the physical data center\ninfrastructure that sits underneath that,\n\n206\n00:11:52.081 --> 00:11:54.789\nthat will feed the monitoring,\nthe networking,\n\n207\n00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:58.978\nthe storage capabilities with fiber\nchannel, and with all the things that we\n\n208\n00:11:58.978 --> 00:12:01.960\ntalk about both in the physical and\nthe logical world.\n\n209\n00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.710\nWe have to think about all these\nthings and really paint a picture.\n\n210\n00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.100\nRight?\nBuild a picture\n\n211\n00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.870\nof almost like a sandwich, right?\n\n212\n00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.300\nManagement software up at the top, our\nvirtualization layer in the middle with\n\n213\n00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.500\nour CPU, RAM, networking, and\nstorage resources allocated there.\n\n214\n00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.490\nAnd then the physical data center\ninfrastructure at the bottom\n\n215\n00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.730\nwhere we have all the hosts,\nwe have all of the switches,\n\n216\n00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.150\nthe routers, we have all the stuff we\ndo for our little slice of it, and\n\n217\n00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.550\nthen more broadly for all of the companies\nor entities that are hosting there.\n\n218\n00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.250\nSo in a multi-tenant environment,\nwe would see hundreds,\n\n219\n00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.430\nthousands of hosts being deployed.\n\n220\n00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.730\nWe'd have to think about this picture,\nas we get started with this conversation,\n\n221\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.020\nreally to understand what the moving\nparts are of the cloud infrastructure,\n\n222\n00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.570\nout beyond just saying we've got\nsome things that we wanna manage.\n\n223\n00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.910\nWe've got some machines that\nare running or we've got this or that.\n\n224\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.620\nWe've got to bring that all together or\nbuild all that together along with\n\n225\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.310\nthe supporting elements, the policy, the\nmanagement software, the interaction and\n\n226\n00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.910\nthe risk management that goes with that.\n\n227\n00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:03.920\nSo in the physical environment, right,\nwe've got to think about the fact that\n\n228\n00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.870\nin the data center, and I'll remind\nyou again that we provided to you,\n\n229\n00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.490\nback in one of our earlier episodes,\nthe ability to go out and\n\n230\n00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:14.200\ntake a look at that really cool video\nright from the Google Data Center Tour.\n\n231\n00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.540\nSo if you haven't seen that,\ngo ahead and take a look at that or\n\n232\n00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.312\ngrab that URL out of the show\nnotes to make sure you watch it.\n\n233\n00:13:19.312 --> 00:13:22.615\nYou'll get to see what a data center\nlooks like at the enterprise level.\n\n234\n00:13:22.615 --> 00:13:26.295\nIf you haven't seen one, if you don't\nget the chance to interact with one,\n\n235\n00:13:26.295 --> 00:13:28.375\nif this is not something you do, but\n\n236\n00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:31.145\nyou are part of a team maybe\nthat is consuming resource, but\n\n237\n00:13:31.145 --> 00:13:34.310\nyou just may not get to go to a data\ncenter like this, it's pretty cool.\n\n238\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.510\nIt is really, really cool to see.\n\n239\n00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:38.210\nI know Wes was incredibly excited,\nor Wes, I'm sorry.\n\n240\n00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Daniel, cuz I'm thinking Saturday.\n\n241\n00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.720\nDaniel was incredibly excited\nwhen we took a look at the video.\n\n242\n00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.590\nWe had that great shot of him with that-\n>> [LAUGH] The grin.\n\n243\n00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.270\n>> Crazy joker-like smile on his face.\n\n244\n00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.130\nSo yeah, you do wanna take a look at that.\n\n245\n00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:52.220\nIt is actually pretty neat.\n\n246\n00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.430\nIt's about an eight-minute video.\n\n247\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.290\n>> Kinda takes it out of the abstract for\nus.\n\n248\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.080\nWe think of the cloud as just this\nsomething that's out there and\n\n249\n00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.400\nwe don't have a real defined\nsense of it in our mind's eye.\n\n250\n00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.230\nWhen we get to see something that says,\n\n251\n00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.580\nhere is what one of these\ndata centers look like.\n\n252\n00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.080\nOkay, now I understand, there.\n\n253\n00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.020\nIt's just like a giant set of servers\ninteracts in a physical environment,\n\n254\n00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.160\non a massive scale.\n\n255\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.530\nAnd then now I start to get a sense\nof what actually is going on,\n\n256\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:18.760\nwhere my data is, and\nit takes it out of that abstraction.\n\n257\n00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.599\n>> It does, it does make it more real,\n\n258\n00:14:20.599 --> 00:14:23.770\nright, more concrete,\nless abstract to your point for us.\n\n259\n00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.830\nI remember the first time many,\n\n260\n00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.270\nmany years ago that I got to go to one\nof these data centers for a customer.\n\n261\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.778\nWe were doing some work and they're like,\nwow, we need to get this and this done.\n\n262\n00:14:32.778 --> 00:14:35.760\nWhile data centers have\nalways been a secure area,\n\n263\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.630\nthey were not as secure at some\npoints in time as they may be today.\n\n264\n00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.120\nWe have a lot of additional concerns and\n\n265\n00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.700\nthings out there that lurk\nthat we have to address.\n\n266\n00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.335\nAnd see, I got to go take\na tour of their data center.\n\n267\n00:14:48.335 --> 00:14:52.444\nAnd they were co-hosting at the times,\nthey were co-locating with other clients\n\n268\n00:14:52.444 --> 00:14:55.961\nin a kind of a communal data center run\nby a company, so it was just a big,\n\n269\n00:14:55.961 --> 00:14:58.799\nhuge building,\nseveral hundred thousand square feet.\n\n270\n00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.380\nAnd I was able to go in and they arranged\nfor everything and they said, okay.\n\n271\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.780\nWe're gonna go here.\nYou're gonna do this.\n\n272\n00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.120\nAnd we have our cage here.\n\n273\n00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.980\nWe're gonna go spend time.\n\n274\n00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.680\nWe'll figure out all this stuff.\n\n275\n00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.080\nAnd it was a pretty\ninteresting environment for me,\n\n276\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.200\nbecause although I knew about all these\nthings, I had seen them, and I certainly\n\n277\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.530\nunderstood how they worked, I had not seen\nthem on the scale, to your point, right.\n\n278\n00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.576\nAnd I had been in customer-owned data\ncenters that were maybe 1,000, 2,000,\n\n279\n00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:23.270\n3,000 square feet on site at a building.\n\n280\n00:15:23.270 --> 00:15:27.233\nHey, we've got 30 servers sitting in there\nand here's the key, go open the door,\n\n281\n00:15:27.233 --> 00:15:30.470\ndo what you want to do, and\nnobody really pays attention to you.\n\n282\n00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.430\nThis is different.\n\n283\n00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.020\nYou've got closed-circuit TV monitoring.\n\n284\n00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.550\nYou've got locked cages.\n\n285\n00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.650\nThings are demarcated.\n\n286\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.345\nThere are certain areas you're not allowed\nto go into for a variety of reasons.\n\n287\n00:15:40.345 --> 00:15:44.346\nThey may be privately used for hosting\ndedicated resources, or they may just be\n\n288\n00:15:44.346 --> 00:15:47.930\npartitioned off because they're doing\na build-out or a break down and\n\n289\n00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:52.173\nthey don't want you in there while they're\nrearranging the floor and doing all that\n\n290\n00:15:52.173 --> 00:15:55.665\nkind of stuff, cuz you could fall\nthrough right into the open floor.\n\n291\n00:15:55.665 --> 00:15:57.000\nOr they're moving cables or\n\n292\n00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.176\nreapportioning infrastructure\nThey're doing all these things.\n\n293\n00:16:00.176 --> 00:16:02.204\nAnd a data center is\na dynamic living area, and\n\n294\n00:16:02.204 --> 00:16:04.230\nyou've got to think about it that way.\n\n295\n00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.820\nIt is, and I remember when I was a kid,\nif you ever saw these when you were a kid.\n\n296\n00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.300\nYou have that little, it's maybe like\na four by four or three by three square of\n\n297\n00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.700\ntiles, right, so plastic with the little\ntiles you could moved around, it was\n\n298\n00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.960\nalmost like one side of a Rubik's cube, to\nswitch out before you had Rubik's cubes.\n\n299\n00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.320\nShows you how hold I am, right?\n\n300\n00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.880\nSo you had this game, and you would move\nthe colored tiles or build the picture,\n\n301\n00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.630\nbut you had to slide them, right,\nso they were all in a little track.\n\n302\n00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:26.760\nYou'd move them around.\n\n303\n00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.090\nAnd so it's kind of like that,\nbecause essentially,\n\n304\n00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:34.270\nas customers grow organically in the data\ncenter, they're absorbing space, right?\n\n305\n00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:38.030\nAnd so they're taking on more cave space,\nand somebody has to come out.\n\n306\n00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.090\nIt's almost like Disney World in the\nmiddle of the night where you don't see\n\n307\n00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.050\nthe elves come out.\n\n308\n00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.600\nThey do all the magic and\neverything happens.\n\n309\n00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.410\nYou show up in the morning and, wow,\nthere's this new potted plant sculpture.\n\n310\n00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.170\nThere's this new ride or whatever.\n\n311\n00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.510\nAnd so you see all these people\nlate at night are coming out.\n\n312\n00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.960\nAnd they're essentially\nretrofitting the space.\n\n313\n00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.760\nThey're breaking down part of the cage.\n\n314\n00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.670\nThey're extending it,\nthey're reallocating it.\n\n315\n00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.490\nThey're moving racks.\n\n316\n00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.110\nThey do all sorts of stuff.\n\n317\n00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.220\nSo these data centers\nare pretty interesting places.\n\n318\n00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.630\nThey run 24 hours a day.\n\n319\n00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.770\nThey never turn off essentially.\n\n320\n00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.840\nAt least if things go well anyway,\nthey should not normally turn off.\n\n321\n00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.740\nAnd they're like miniature cities,\nespecially the really big ones.\n\n322\n00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.030\nThey've got dedicated staffing.\n\n323\n00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.690\nThey've got hosting areas.\n\n324\n00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.360\nThey've got communal areas.\n\n325\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.570\nThey've got break areas where you\ncan essentially sleep and eat and\n\n326\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.900\ndo that stuff if you're there\nlong term because of some sort\n\n327\n00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:29.180\nof commitment to keep the system on\nbecause of a DR event or whatever.\n\n328\n00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.750\nIn the more modern ones,\n\n329\n00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:35.050\nthey typically have a visitor areas where\nyou actually can do temporary works.\n\n330\n00:17:35.050 --> 00:17:36.640\nThey've got little cubes setup.\n\n331\n00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.210\nYou can do some daywork kinda thing\nif you're there onsite, working.\n\n332\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:41.410\nSo, yeah, it's pretty interesting place.\n\n333\n00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.340\nIt's like a hotel without a bar, right?\n\n334\n00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.030\nIt's like a techno hotel without a bar.\n\n335\n00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:48.080\nSo it is a pretty interesting place.\n\n336\n00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.200\nAnd the Google one, as you'll see when\nyou watch the video, has this area that's\n\n337\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.550\noutside the secure containment area where\nthey've got the common staff room and\n\n338\n00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.880\naround and\nthey've got pool tables in there.\n\n339\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.820\nAnd they've got the vending area and\nall that.\n\n340\n00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.950\nAnd then you go into\nthe high security area.\n\n341\n00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.930\nAnd it's all business, right?\n\n342\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.810\nYou're in there only\nwhen you have to work.\n\n343\n00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.390\nAnd you're working on infrastructure and\nyou come out when you're done.\n\n344\n00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:10.620\nSo the physical environment\nis really pretty interesting.\n\n345\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.230\nIn most of these data centers,\nit is very loud.\n\n346\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.420\nI don't know if you've been into\none of the really, really big ones.\n\n347\n00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.800\nBut especially depending on when they\nwere built, they are, in some cases,\n\n348\n00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.640\nlike walking out onto a runway.\n\n349\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.940\nThe, just the sheer volume and\n\n350\n00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.310\nnoise, from the amount of\ninfrastructure that's running.\n\n351\n00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:30.340\nThe servers, the cooling fans, all that\nkind of stuff, is very, very massive.\n\n352\n00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:33.030\nBut then, some interesting new\ndesigns that are coming out.\n\n353\n00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.140\nThey've got, I think Google just\nbuilt one of these data centers.\n\n354\n00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.540\nMicrosoft built one that has actually\nbeen deployed recently and tested.\n\n355\n00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.700\nYou can check out a video on this as well\nwhere they actually put one under water.\n\n356\n00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.230\nSo Microsoft built essentially\na self-contained containment vessel and\n\n357\n00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.580\nran it for three months off the coast\nof California to do the test.\n\n358\n00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:56.990\nThey submerged it and they ran it,\nand they're using the ambient water\n\n359\n00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:59.480\ntemperature in the ocean to\nessentially do the cooling.\n\n360\n00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.020\nAnd it actually worked really well.\n\n361\n00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.600\nAnd they're trying to figure\nout the logistic of the design,\n\n362\n00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.970\nbut they're looking at new innovative\nways to run this infrastructure, so\n\n363\n00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:10.910\nthey don't have to put it up on land,\ncool it to 60 degrees or\n\n364\n00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:14.050\nwhatever it is and\nconsume massive amounts of energy.\n\n365\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.330\nGoogle built one that actually is what\nwe would call a chicken coop design,\n\n366\n00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.780\nwhich is actually fairly popular these\ndays, although not deployed everywhere.\n\n367\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.610\nBut they're using the ambient air\nthat flows in certain areas to move\n\n368\n00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:27.930\nthrough the data center in a controlled\nfashion, so that they can cool and\n\n369\n00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.450\ntherefore as a result don't need\nto run massive HVAC systems.\n\n370\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.220\nSo if you've ever seen chicken coops,\nthey're just big huge buildings with big\n\n371\n00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:40.460\nfans or open areas on either end that are\nsucking air through to create air flow.\n\n372\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.590\nAnd so in these data centers,\nthey're building them in areas they have\n\n373\n00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:47.990\nhigh pressure wind that's\nconstantly coming through and\n\n374\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.620\nhigher elevations where it's cooler.\n\n375\n00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.980\nAnd they're actually using the outside air\nflow along with fans to kind of guide it,\n\n376\n00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.810\nbut to essentially just vacuum it through\nthe system to create the cooling.\n\n377\n00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.930\nAnd as a result, they say that in the new\ndata centers, they're doing this, and\n\n378\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.710\nthey're so quiet compared to what you\nwould think, because of all the noise.\n\n379\n00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.360\nThey're so quiet that it's eery,\n\n380\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.560\nbecause you don't have the high\nvolume noise because of the HVAC and\n\n381\n00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.380\nall the things that we just kinda of get\ndesensitized to, and we take for granted.\n\n382\n00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.890\nSo it's kind of interesting, or\nit's a lot of cool stuff going on there.\n\n383\n00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.770\nBut we want to make sure we understand\nthere's very high power densities\n\n384\n00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.060\nin these data centers.\n\n385\n00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:24.050\nWe have cooling requirements as\nwell as heating requirements,\n\n386\n00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:24.940\ndepending on where we are.\n\n387\n00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.380\nWe have to evacuate hot air.\n\n388\n00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.440\nWe have to bring in cold air so\nwe talk about cold aisle and\n\n389\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.960\nhot aisle separation where we\nhave to essentially define and\n\n390\n00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.530\ncreate the architecture in such\na way that down the center aisle,\n\n391\n00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:41.550\nlet's just say hypothetically if we've got\nserver infrastructure racked up in rows on\n\n392\n00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.350\neither side the central area where you\nwalk is either the cold aisle where cold\n\n393\n00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.760\nair is going to be coming down because\ncold air drops and hot air rises right.\n\n394\n00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.530\nSo you blow cold air down or\n\n395\n00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.180\nblow it up from under the floor\ndepending on how you set it up.\n\n396\n00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.250\nBut a lot of times you will have the cold\naisle where the cold air is circulating.\n\n397\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.840\nAnd then you have on the outside hot\naisles where essentially the hot air is\n\n398\n00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.415\nbeing sucked out and you're bringing it\nback up under the floor and cooling it.\n\n399\n00:21:07.415 --> 00:21:11.520\nYou you are blowing it out in some way\nto take it away to remove the heat.\n\n400\n00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.190\nAnd so we talk about hot cold\ncontainment because yuo have to\n\n401\n00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.930\nhave an architecture that essentially\nwill control the airflow.\n\n402\n00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.890\nIf you just randomly let air mix,\n\n403\n00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.800\nwhat you're gonna get is you're gonna get\nlittle miniature weather vortices right?\n\n404\n00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.370\nYou get hot and cold air mixing.\n\n405\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.391\nAnd you basically have, unfortunately,\n\n406\n00:21:27.391 --> 00:21:29.926\nan inability in the morning\nto control temperature.\n\n407\n00:21:29.926 --> 00:21:32.710\nNumber two, you get, humidity buildup.\n\n408\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.690\nSo this can be a major issue, because\nyou have hot and cold air colliding.\n\n409\n00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.520\nYou're gonna have mixed\nweather environments.\n\n410\n00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.200\nAnd you're gonna get these little islands\nof coolness, these little islands of\n\n411\n00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.570\nhotness, and everything in the middle is\nreally not gonna be controlled very well.\n\n412\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.030\nAnd so it's a very big problem.\n\n413\n00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.450\nAnd you know, setting up and\ndesigning the architecture for\n\n414\n00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.610\nthese large data center build\nouts is an art and a science.\n\n415\n00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:53.310\nAnd you really have to\nknow what you're doing.\n\n416\n00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.950\nThere are companies or entities out\nthere you can look to for guidance so\n\n417\n00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.270\nyou can go to and\ntake a look at, for instance,\n\n418\n00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:05.120\nASHRAE, which is in the United States,\nthe entity that sets the temperature and\n\n419\n00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.750\nthe humidity standards for data centers,\namong many other things they do.\n\n420\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.480\nThere's the Uptime Institute,\nwhich is well known both in the US and\n\n421\n00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.460\nglobally for the tiering standard matrix\nthat we come up with for data centers,\n\n422\n00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.110\ntier one, tier two, tier three,\ntier four for hosting.\n\n423\n00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.470\nThey're kind of behind all that.\n\n424\n00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.660\nThey've set those standards up,\ntalked about the power density and\n\n425\n00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.350\ndifferent ways we have to manage.\n\n426\n00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.610\nThese are two of the standards bodies out\nthere that exist for data centered design.\n\n427\n00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.030\nBut you want to be aware of those,\n\n428\n00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.030\nobviously if your not aware of them\nat some point, take a look at them.\n\n429\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.610\nBut you want to have a sense to the kind\nof things you would have to build out\n\n430\n00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.570\na data center if you were\neither a cloud professional or\n\n431\n00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.190\njust generically an IT professional.\n\n432\n00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.960\n>> Adam, is that something that we can get\ninto a level of control over or is that's\n\n433\n00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.480\njust one of those areas that we just have\nto throw into that area of trust again?\n\n434\n00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.450\nWe've talked about having to trust or\ncloud providers to do somethings for us.\n\n435\n00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.550\nIs this one of those we where that's\nwhere were at or can we go in and\n\n436\n00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.770\nsay I'd rather my servers be in\nthis area of your data center.\n\n437\n00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.090\n>> So it will depend on where\nwe decide to host, right.\n\n438\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:11.200\nSo if, to your point,\nwe are essentially partnering with and\n\n439\n00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.510\ntrusting a vendor,\na third part Cloud vendor.\n\n440\n00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.750\nWe really have no say other than\nhey by the way, what I expect,\n\n441\n00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.280\nwhat I need is this amount\nof infrastructure and\n\n442\n00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.460\nI'm assuming you're doing\nall the backend stuff.\n\n443\n00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:26.210\nYou're building out the power,\nbuilding out the HVAC.\n\n444\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.330\nYou're doing the hot and\ncold aisle containment.\n\n445\n00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:31.270\nYou're figuring out how to\nset up the raised flooring so\n\n446\n00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:35.430\nI can run all the piping I need and the\nconduit and all that, and all the cabling.\n\n447\n00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:39.670\nIf I want Fiber channel on the backplane\nand I'm saying I need 40 gig connectors or\n\n448\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.090\ninterconnects, you're gonna provide that.\n\n449\n00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.110\nIf I want physical hardware based HBAs,\n\n450\n00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:47.730\nyou're gonna provide that as\nopposed to software interfaces.\n\n451\n00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.593\nI'm gonna tell the vendor what I want, but\nthe vendor is essentially the merchant.\n\n452\n00:23:50.593 --> 00:23:53.155\nThey're gonna provide me\nwith a list of options,\n\n453\n00:23:53.155 --> 00:23:56.511\nand I'm gonna essentially specify,\nright, what I would like.\n\n454\n00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:57.707\nYou ever go have dim sum?\n\n455\n00:23:57.707 --> 00:23:58.247\n>> Yeah.\n>> So\n\n456\n00:23:58.247 --> 00:24:02.761\nif you think about that model where you\nget the menu, okay, so what's the 25, 30,\n\n457\n00:24:02.761 --> 00:24:04.280\n40 things I can order?\n\n458\n00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.380\nAnd you essentially just\ncheck off what you want.\n\n459\n00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.040\nIt's basically like that, right, if you're\ngoing to a vendor that's gonna provide it.\n\n460\n00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.096\nIf you're gonna build your data center\nyourself, if you essentially are creating\n\n461\n00:24:14.096 --> 00:24:16.650\nit on-site,\nas I said some of my customers will do,\n\n462\n00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:19.130\nthen you obviously are gonna\nhave a lot more control, right?\n\n463\n00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.190\nBecause you'll hopefully,\nif you're smart enough,\n\n464\n00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.330\nyou'll work with a vendor that does this,\nthat understands how to do certified\n\n465\n00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:28.420\ndesign, understands the standards that I\njust mentioned, the ashrae standards for\n\n466\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.960\ntemperature control,\nthe uptime institute standards for\n\n467\n00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.870\narchitecture and design,\npower management, things like that.\n\n468\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:40.770\nAnd as a result of that, you will then get\na data center essentially that's built to\n\n469\n00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:42.550\nyour spec, right, whatever you may want.\n\n470\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:47.440\nSo I have a customer down where\nI am from in South Florida,\n\n471\n00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.840\na couple of them actually, that because of\nthe boom bust cycles over the last decade,\n\n472\n00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:55.010\nwith Internet service providing and\nhosting and\n\n473\n00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:59.455\nthings like that, we had several\nlarge ISPs that were based in\n\n474\n00:24:59.455 --> 00:25:02.905\nSouth Florida that had built out\nmassive data center infrastructure.\n\n475\n00:25:02.905 --> 00:25:05.385\nAnd then,\nbecause of the downturn in the economy and\n\n476\n00:25:05.385 --> 00:25:08.695\njust a variety of things,\nreally just could not make the model work.\n\n477\n00:25:08.695 --> 00:25:12.195\nAnd so they sold off very large\nportions of that infrastructure.\n\n478\n00:25:12.195 --> 00:25:15.605\nI have a couple of big Enterprise\ncustomers that bought data centers for\n\n479\n00:25:15.605 --> 00:25:16.998\nliterally pennies on the dollar.\n\n480\n00:25:16.998 --> 00:25:20.730\nAnd own 400,000 square\nfoot data centers for\n\n481\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.070\na fraction of what they\nwould have cost and are now\n\n482\n00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.320\nbought more infrastructure capacity\nthan they need, but they're smart.\n\n483\n00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.275\nThey bought the building.\n\n484\n00:25:28.275 --> 00:25:31.379\nThey own it outright, and\nnow what they've done is set up the 20,\n\n485\n00:25:31.379 --> 00:25:34.360\n30,000 square feet they\nneed to run their business.\n\n486\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.470\nAnd they're gonna start outsourcing\nessentially and hiring out as a colo\n\n487\n00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.120\nin their silo in their industry sector for\nthe rest of the space.\n\n488\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.400\nSo they're gonna provide managed services\nto businesses in their general sector,\n\n489\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.110\nand they're gonna use that space to\ngenerate revenue, which is what the ISP\n\n490\n00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:54.120\nmodel essentially was, but at the time,\nthe ISP model couldn't make it work.\n\n491\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.870\nNow they have the opportunity\nto do that for a lot cheaper.\n\n492\n00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.490\nSomebody else built it,\nessentially, right?\n\n493\n00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.480\nThey came in and bought it, and\nnow they're just gonna run it.\n\n494\n00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:02.880\nSo it's kind of interesting because\nyou will have that opportunity,\n\n495\n00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:04.040\nrare occasion for that.\n\n496\n00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:07.476\nBut you have the opportunity to build\nyour own really very, very often.\n\n497\n00:26:07.476 --> 00:26:11.134\nMaybe not as big, maybe not as massive,\nbut many companies will go out and\n\n498\n00:26:11.134 --> 00:26:14.380\ndo several thousand square feet and\njust provision it out.\n\n499\n00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.419\nThey may not follow the uptime\ninstitute and ashrae standards, but\n\n500\n00:26:17.419 --> 00:26:20.778\nthey'll provision out the basic\nconcepts of data center design, right,\n\n501\n00:26:20.778 --> 00:26:22.230\nto understand how to manage it.\n\n502\n00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.852\nSo we think about back up power.\n\n503\n00:26:23.852 --> 00:26:26.420\nWe gotta have generators, gotta have UPSs.\n\n504\n00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.012\nSome of these data centers, you walk in,\n\n505\n00:26:28.012 --> 00:26:31.460\nyou've got massive rooms off to the side\ndedicated to the battery room, right,\n\n506\n00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.910\nwhich is nothing but the UPS area, where\nyou've got all the UPS systems running.\n\n507\n00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.460\nIt's typically an area that's firewalled\noff or cordoned off with a secured door,\n\n508\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:42.822\nso you don't wanna go wandering around\nin there, you'd trip over something.\n\n509\n00:26:42.822 --> 00:26:45.848\nNot only could you cause a major outage,\nyou could electrocute yourself and\n\n510\n00:26:45.848 --> 00:26:48.211\nit's a very,\nvery difficult environment to operate, and\n\n511\n00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:50.620\nyou gotta be really careful\nabout these things, right.\n\n512\n00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.780\nSo we got redundant everything, you've got\nmultiple vendors bringing in circuits,\n\n513\n00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:57.870\nmultiple utility providers,\nmultiple Internet providers.\n\n514\n00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.260\nYou've got the backup generator or\ngenerators, so\n\n515\n00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.080\nyou've gotta worry about fuel and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n516\n00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.647\nThese generators have to be turned over,\nat least once every month because you\n\n517\n00:27:06.647 --> 00:27:10.125\ncan't just let the diesel oil and the\nstuff that runs these sit in the tanks.\n\n518\n00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:12.308\nIf they're natural gas fired or\nwhatever they are,\n\n519\n00:27:12.308 --> 00:27:15.781\nyou still have to run the infrastructure,\nso you've gotta power on test that you do\n\n520\n00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:18.595\ntypically at least once a month\nwhere the generators kick in.\n\n521\n00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:22.350\nThey'll run for several minutes to cycle\nthe system, and then they're powered down.\n\n522\n00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.040\nThose are also fairly loud.\n\n523\n00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.160\nThey tend to be very big, they're\noutside the building traditionally.\n\n524\n00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.360\nAnd in some cases, they're massive.\n\n525\n00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.890\nThey may be as long as 18\nwheel tractor trailers,\n\n526\n00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.670\nthese 50 some odd foot massive containers\nthat they run these things in.\n\n527\n00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.020\nSo you just have to understand that\nthere's a lot of different stuff there.\n\n528\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.080\nWe have power distribution we\nhave to concern ourselves with,\n\n529\n00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.430\ndifferent areas of the building\nare sectored out and controlled on a grid.\n\n530\n00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.440\nSo we have to just interact\nwith all these things and\n\n531\n00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.240\nreally understand what's going on there.\n\n532\n00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.890\nBut it is important for us to consider\nthat when we are designing this kind of\n\n533\n00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.490\na building, it's not just about I'll throw\nthe servers over there on the floor.\n\n534\n00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.190\nI'll connect them up, run some cable on\nthe floor, and everything will be good.\n\n535\n00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.410\nEverything has to be\ndone a very specific way.\n\n536\n00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:04.450\nIf it's not done that way,\nnot only is it not secure, but\n\n537\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.230\nthere are safety issues, right?\n\n538\n00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.860\nPeople are walking around in there,\nthey may trip on things.\n\n539\n00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.640\nYou have a raised floor, if you don't\nsecure the floor the right way,\n\n540\n00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.610\nsomebody's walking around,\nthey fall through.\n\n541\n00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:17.960\nThey may fall onto conduit, they may\nfall onto a cable nest or a bundle.\n\n542\n00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.836\nThere could be all sorts of sharp objects\nsitting under there because you've got\n\n543\n00:28:21.836 --> 00:28:24.744\nmounting brackets and clips,\nthere's all sorts of stuff.\n\n544\n00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:27.425\nIt's just a mess, and\nyou gotta be really careful.\n\n545\n00:28:27.425 --> 00:28:28.765\nI mean, it's a controlled mess.\n\n546\n00:28:28.765 --> 00:28:30.525\nIt's controlled chaos, but it's a mess.\n\n547\n00:28:30.525 --> 00:28:34.295\nAnd you really gotta think about the fact\nthat predominantly, most people should not\n\n548\n00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:37.685\njust be given free reign to walk around\nthe data center either unescorted or\n\n549\n00:28:37.685 --> 00:28:39.310\nwithout a purpose for being there.\n\n550\n00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:42.390\nI hate when I go to customer sites,\nand I'm either there to do work or\n\n551\n00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:46.450\ndo an audit, and I see that,\nthere's work going on in the data center.\n\n552\n00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.600\nI don't hate that part, but I ask, hey,\nwho's in there, what are they doing?\n\n553\n00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.860\nAnd I see people in there\nthat just don't belong there.\n\n554\n00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:54.680\nWe're giving customers a tour or whatever.\n\n555\n00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.450\nOkay, I mean, that's fine.\n\n556\n00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.670\nIn the building,\nyou wanna give them a tour, no big deal.\n\n557\n00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.160\nBut they're with somebody who knows how\nto navigate, so that's probably okay.\n\n558\n00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.900\nBut vendors should never be allowed on\nthe data center floor without an escort.\n\n559\n00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.530\nPeople that are from another department or\n\n560\n00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.620\nanother area of the business,\nif it's your company owned data center,\n\n561\n00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.310\nmay feel it's okay to go wander\nout there to do something.\n\n562\n00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:15.210\nThey should only be allowed to go\nout there if they have a reason and\n\n563\n00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:15.828\nare escorted.\n\n564\n00:29:15.828 --> 00:29:19.752\nIf not, IT should essentially proxy for\nthem and be doing that work.\n\n565\n00:29:19.752 --> 00:29:23.210\nA DBA should not be going\nup to the data center,\n\n566\n00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:26.800\ngoing into the cage,\ngoing up to their physical instance for\n\n567\n00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.745\ntheir data, database, or\nwhatever it is, and interacting.\n\n568\n00:29:30.745 --> 00:29:33.155\nThey should be remoting\nin to manage that system.\n\n569\n00:29:33.155 --> 00:29:37.155\nYou don't stand in front of a server\non a KVM and do your database queries.\n\n570\n00:29:37.155 --> 00:29:40.115\nThat's just not acceptable\nfrom a security standpoint,\n\n571\n00:29:40.115 --> 00:29:44.225\nfrom a safety standpoint, from a hey,\nwhat are you doing standpoint, right?\n\n572\n00:29:44.225 --> 00:29:45.315\nIt doesn't happen.\n\n573\n00:29:45.315 --> 00:29:46.785\nI mean, it does, but it shouldn't.\n\n574\n00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.015\nLet me put it that way, right?\n\n575\n00:29:48.015 --> 00:29:50.340\nWe have remote management capabilities for\na reason.\n\n576\n00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:55.007\nAnd as CCSPs, we have to think about the\nfact that if we're gonna allow anybody who\n\n577\n00:29:55.007 --> 00:29:58.660\nhas a right to claim certain\ninfrastructure cuz their stuff runs\n\n578\n00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.991\non it to show up and essentially go into\nthe data center and interact with it,\n\n579\n00:30:02.991 --> 00:30:05.384\nit's gonna be like Disneyland, right.\n\n580\n00:30:05.384 --> 00:30:09.065\nWe're gonna have thousands of people\nwandering through the data center and\n\n581\n00:30:09.065 --> 00:30:10.800\nlooking at their infrastructure.\n\n582\n00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.080\nThere's no way to keep security up and\nrunning in that environment.\n\n583\n00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.050\nYou're gonna just have chaos.\n\n584\n00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.950\nSo, we don't, as a standing rule,\n\n585\n00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.420\nwant anybody in the data center,\nunless they're authorized to be there.\n\n586\n00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.480\nCustomers have a right to say I'd\nlike to see my infrastructure.\n\n587\n00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.280\nWe as the vendor, the cloud provider, have\nto provide them a management interface,\n\n588\n00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.490\nan API of some kind to connect to and\ninstructions on how to do that securely.\n\n589\n00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.550\nWe have to do the access control and\nthe identity and\n\n590\n00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.590\naccess management on that connection.\n\n591\n00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:41.120\nWe have to do the monitoring on it, we\nhave to do the routing to path it there,\n\n592\n00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.210\nwe have to do the monitoring to secure it.\n\n593\n00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:44.880\nBut then we let them do their stuff.\n\n594\n00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.210\nThat's their infrastructure,\n\n595\n00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.630\nat least as long as they pay\ntheir bill anyway it is, right.\n\n596\n00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.288\nAnd as a result of that, once they\nget there, we leave them alone, but\n\n597\n00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:54.458\nthe control and\nthe ramp up to get there and\n\n598\n00:30:54.458 --> 00:30:57.191\nthe pathways are maintained\nby the cloud provider.\n\n599\n00:30:57.191 --> 00:31:00.130\nAnd so we have to partner again,\nthis is a question of trust, right,\n\n600\n00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:02.374\nwe have to partner again in\norder to figure that out.\n\n601\n00:31:02.374 --> 00:31:04.480\nWhen we think about network\nfunctionality and access,\n\n602\n00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.420\nwe think about all the traditional stuff,\nright?\n\n603\n00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.958\nWe think about the routers,\nthe switches, the gateways,\n\n604\n00:31:09.958 --> 00:31:14.987\nthe access control mechanisms, single,\ndual, multi-factor authentication,\n\n605\n00:31:14.987 --> 00:31:19.373\nsecure telnet, so things like SSH\nare used to be able to ensure that remote\n\n606\n00:31:19.373 --> 00:31:22.817\nmanagement traffic is gonna\nbe tunnelled in encrypted.\n\n607\n00:31:22.817 --> 00:31:27.774\nWe may be using RDP to connect\nessentially into a remote session.\n\n608\n00:31:27.774 --> 00:31:30.994\nWe should be using secure\nmanagement software,\n\n609\n00:31:30.994 --> 00:31:34.460\nwhatever that may be based\non the vendor choice.\n\n610\n00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.225\nIf it's VMWare, if it's Microsoft,\nif it's Citrix,\n\n611\n00:31:37.225 --> 00:31:41.100\nevery vendor has their own preference for\nhow you manage their product.\n\n612\n00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.433\nTheir consoles are secure when you\nspin them up and enable them and\n\n613\n00:31:44.433 --> 00:31:45.654\nuse them the right way.\n\n614\n00:31:45.654 --> 00:31:49.429\nWhether they're web enabled or it's\njust an API from an application or both,\n\n615\n00:31:49.429 --> 00:31:52.416\ndepends on the version,\nyou wanna think about that, right?\n\n616\n00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:56.207\nSo rate limiting and throttling on\nthe bandwidth Continuous monitoring,\n\n617\n00:31:56.207 --> 00:31:59.037\nmaking sure we have address\nallocation under control so\n\n618\n00:31:59.037 --> 00:32:03.190\nwhen know what IPs are being used, what\nsubnets, there may be VLANing involved,\n\n619\n00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.836\nyou know all these things\nare going to be important,\n\n620\n00:32:05.836 --> 00:32:09.627\nwe have to be concerned with and\nunderstand all of this Software defining,\n\n621\n00:32:09.627 --> 00:32:12.450\nas I mentioned,\nis very important in this arena.\n\n622\n00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:16.560\nBeing able to automate the provisioning\nand the management of infrastructure,\n\n623\n00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.940\ntaking the human out of the mix, and\nessentially trying to separate the data\n\n624\n00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.490\nfrom the management plane and\nhaving a very clear demarcation.\n\n625\n00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.720\nSo that configuration is now done through\na series of, either answer files, or\n\n626\n00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.150\npredetermined configurations.\n\n627\n00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.410\nThat are gonna be applied through\nsome sort of a scripting or\n\n628\n00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:39.090\nautomation process to, configure and then\ncontinuously monitor Monitor real line and\n\n629\n00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:43.130\nremediate as necessary on baselines and\ncontinuous monitoring.\n\n630\n00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.640\nThis is really what software defining is.\n\n631\n00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.050\nAnd we can software define pretty\nmuch the entire data center today.\n\n632\n00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:53.870\nCisco, VMware Microsoft, Citrix,\nhave all been leaders in various areas,\n\n633\n00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.300\nfor various reasons, around this\nthought process over the years.\n\n634\n00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.300\nCisco probably, one of the most vocal and\n\n635\n00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.520\nbiggest proponents of it,\nin the enterprise space today,\n\n636\n00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.180\nwith regards to software\ndefining networking, certainly.\n\n637\n00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.310\nVMWare.\nSoftware defining the data center overall\n\n638\n00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:12.060\nand partnering with Cisco to software\ndefine the network and integrate that.\n\n639\n00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.360\nStorage vendors like EMC, Hitachi,\n\n640\n00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:18.370\nDell are very big proponents\nof this omni storage side.\n\n641\n00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:22.190\nSo Virtual SAN, Base Technologies\nwere all software defined and\n\n642\n00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:25.900\nthings of that nature today provide\nessentially a control plan to manage\n\n643\n00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.850\nthe traffic on a more\nabstract level that removes.\n\n644\n00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.290\nThat direct interaction\nthrough direct management\n\n645\n00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:35.700\nof the network components\nthrough this configuration so\n\n646\n00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.520\nwe don't have to worry about having\nsomebody going in and constantly\n\n647\n00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.000\nadjusting things we apply a template and\nessentially then manage to that standard.\n\n648\n00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.420\nThis is what software\ndefining is all about.\n\n649\n00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.790\nWe want to be thinking about all these\nthings we also want to think about at\n\n650\n00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:52.240\nthe hardware layer What the hardware\nsecurity itself will be.\n\n651\n00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.440\nWe could provide the cage,\nwe could provide the guards, the guns and\n\n652\n00:33:55.440 --> 00:34:00.570\nthe gates as I talk about, but beyond that\nhow are we gonna actually secure that rack\n\n653\n00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.815\nof servers or that blade enclosure Itself,\nnot physically lock it up in a cage,\n\n654\n00:34:04.815 --> 00:34:07.875\nbut when we actually go up to it,\nhow are we gonna interact?\n\n655\n00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:10.745\nAre the USB ports active and available?\n\n656\n00:34:10.745 --> 00:34:11.875\nDo we have a KVM?\n\n657\n00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:15.932\nIf we use a KVM, are we using a secure\nKVM that's gonna be encrypted and\n\n658\n00:34:15.932 --> 00:34:18.642\nhas tamper resistant\ncontrols associated with it.\n\n659\n00:34:18.642 --> 00:34:22.592\nSo every channel with communication to\nevery physical server hooked up to it\n\n660\n00:34:22.592 --> 00:34:25.682\nis isolated and\nprocess managed independently.\n\n661\n00:34:25.682 --> 00:34:28.672\nSo that way, if I've got two\ntenants running in the same stack,\n\n662\n00:34:28.672 --> 00:34:32.002\nessentially on the same KVM,\none tenant doing maintenance\n\n663\n00:34:32.002 --> 00:34:35.122\ncannot essentially see traffic on\nthe other cuz it's locket out.\n\n664\n00:34:35.122 --> 00:34:37.920\nSo secure KVMs would have to\nbe thought about and deployed.\n\n665\n00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.960\nWhat about hardware security modules,\n\n666\n00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:43.120\neither external devices that\nare pluggable traditionally or\n\n667\n00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:48.580\nintegrated if we're talking about\na a trusted platform module, which\n\n668\n00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.050\nis traditionally hardware inside of the\nhost, either software or hardware-based.\n\n669\n00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:57.020\nBut essentially both of these concepts\nare gonna give us the ability to create\n\n670\n00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.080\na digital vault essentially, right.\n\n671\n00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.830\nWe're adding our digital identity\nsolutions, our certificates,\n\n672\n00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:08.940\nour encryption keys, our identifiers or\nwhatever kind of solution we may be using,\n\n673\n00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:12.810\nif it's a multi-factor authentication\nsystem, where we're gonna store\n\n674\n00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:17.840\nthese passwords, these certificates,\ntypically the encryption keys as I said.\n\n675\n00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.570\nSecurely in this device.\n\n676\n00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.780\nIt is tamper-resistant.\n\n677\n00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.165\nIf you try to break into it,\nit either crypts or shreds or\n\n678\n00:35:23.165 --> 00:35:27.810\nself-destructs the information or\nrenders it inaccessible and allows\n\n679\n00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:32.730\nus to securely provide and manage these\ncredential based digital identifiers.\n\n680\n00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:36.770\nWithout exposing them unnecessarily by\ncontinuing to send them over the wire\n\n681\n00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.020\nworrying about transmitting them but\n\n682\n00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:41.230\nmaybe not in an encrypted form or\nnot on a secure channel.\n\n683\n00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:44.770\nIt takes the guess work out of making sure\nthat we're talking to the right party.\n\n684\n00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:45.910\nAnd that we're attaching to.\n\n685\n00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.730\nTo when using the right infrastructure.\n\n686\n00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.710\nSo we could set these up\nin servers as hardware.\n\n687\n00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:55.310\nWe can have them in line to essentially\nmonitor and encrypt and decrypt real time\n\n688\n00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:59.340\nthe transmissions for DLP based\ntechnologies as we've talked about.\n\n689\n00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.640\nThere are a lot of ways we use HSMs.\n\n690\n00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.960\nThey are used traditionally for\nhardware acceleration\n\n691\n00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.660\non encryption-decryption gateways because\nwe can store the encryption keys there.\n\n692\n00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.080\nSo these are interesting concepts.\n\n693\n00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.490\nI saw you were shaking your head\nwhen I was talking about this.\n\n694\n00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:16.250\nDid you ever come across these\nwhen you were deploying You know.\n\n695\n00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:20.340\nYou're in the the you did in\nthe data center as network admin.\n\n696\n00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.410\n>> Yeah, yeah.\nA lot of these concepts,\n\n697\n00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.100\nwe definitely had to implement\nthese things because well,\n\n698\n00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.250\nthey're inherent to\nthe systems themselves.\n\n699\n00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.510\nIf we don't do it we're basically\nsetting ourselves up for a fall.\n\n700\n00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.350\nYou wanna make sure you\nfollow the best practices.\n\n701\n00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:37.180\nI wasn't specifically on the design\nteam for implementation.\n\n702\n00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:40.130\nWe need you to do this and\nlearn how this works for us.\n\n703\n00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:45.080\nSo that was my portion of,\nmy contribution, should I say.\n\n704\n00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.040\n>> Okay, so\nyou probably would come across it, but\n\n705\n00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.280\nyou would not have\nnecessarily designed it.\n\n706\n00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.840\nYou would have seen it in operation or\nimplemented it directly.\n\n707\n00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.120\nSo still very important to think\nabout these things, right?\n\n708\n00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.820\nAnd if you haven't seen an HSM before,\nit's actually kinda cool.\n\n709\n00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.540\nIf you just Google for\na picture of hardware security module,\n\n710\n00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:01.120\nyou'll see they look almost like\nexternal USB drives, right?\n\n711\n00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.370\nA lot of times you'll Plug them in.\n\n712\n00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:05.610\nIf you're not really paying attention,\nyou naturally think that's what it is, but\n\n713\n00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:07.580\nthat's traditionally what\nthey kind of look like.\n\n714\n00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:10.040\nThe TPM,\nthe trusted platform module I mentioned,\n\n715\n00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.430\nis either a circuit based hardware\nsystem we put into a system itself.\n\n716\n00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.500\nSo I have one running on my laptop,\nfor instance.\n\n717\n00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.330\nIt's just an internal circuit board\nthat we attach to the mother board and\n\n718\n00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.330\nrun everything through that\ncan be software based as well.\n\n719\n00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:28.274\nSo for instance VMWare and ESXI\nimplements their TPM as a software module\n\n720\n00:37:28.274 --> 00:37:33.265\ninstead of Runs as part of the security\nkernel, so you have that capability to do\n\n721\n00:37:33.265 --> 00:37:37.225\nthat either way and then it will\nthen store securely through software\n\n722\n00:37:37.225 --> 00:37:40.025\nthose digital identity items as\nopposed to putting it in hardware.\n\n723\n00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:43.315\nSo there's different ways to\napproach this kind of thing.\n\n724\n00:37:43.315 --> 00:37:46.865\n>> Okay, well, obviously we have\ninfrastructure when it comes to\n\n725\n00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:51.255\nvirtualization just like we do inside of\na real physical network because, well hey,\n\n726\n00:37:51.255 --> 00:37:53.800\nyou may be building an on prem Cloud\n>> And\n\n727\n00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:57.260\nthat stuff is going to equate\nback into that reality.\n\n728\n00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.130\nSo we have to look at all the ways\nin which we can secure them.\n\n729\n00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.820\nYou have to remember, you've got to come\nat it, just because you're working in\n\n730\n00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.920\nthe Cloud doesn't mean that,\na lot of the standard practices and\n\n731\n00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.460\nfeatures, we just want to look\nat it more of a security minded.\n\n732\n00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.500\nYou wanna keep that as your perspective,\n\n733\n00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.730\nas it were, when you're trying to\ndevelop a good security platform.\n\n734\n00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:19.600\nFor your cloud infrastructure, but\nreally a lot of what we do normally,\n\n735\n00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.160\nis going to translate over to cloud\nbased systems just, you gotta\n\n736\n00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.940\nadd that Cloud element to it a lot of\nthe components that you're gonna run into.\n\n737\n00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:32.500\nVery, very cools stuff and\nAdam We do appreciate it.\n\n738\n00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:34.270\nLooks like our clock has run out and\n\n739\n00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:38.310\nthat's what I was looking at when\nwe talking just a second ago.\n\n740\n00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:40.950\nAnd we have come to the end of\nanother great episode but Adam,\n\n741\n00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:44.740\nwe do thank you as always for dropping by,\nexplaining these concepts to us.\n\n742\n00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:48.070\nWe thank you guys for watching, but like I\nsaid were gonna go ahead and sign off for\n\n743\n00:38:48.070 -->

another exciting\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:20.022\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode well we are continuing on\n\n5\n00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:24.820\nwith our conversation on well, certified\ncloud security professional series.\n\n6\n00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.615\nAnd joining us back in the studio again\ntoday to help us out with that very\n\n7\n00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:29.910\nendeavor is our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.650\nAdam, welcome back to the show and\nhow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.470\n>> Good, good.\n\n10\n00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.050\nI am feeling like we are communicating\nbroadly and widely as we are talking.\n\n11\n00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.330\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n12\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.620\nSo it is going well, and it continues to,\nand as we talk about the cloud,\n\n13\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.830\nwe have to think about how to keep things\ngoing well, and we really have to circle\n\n14\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.770\nback to a theme we have often talked\nabout in prior shows, which is risk.\n\n15\n00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.290\nBecause as we think about cloud\ninfrastructure we continue to talk about\n\n16\n00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.450\nhow to build out\nthe infrastructure of the cloud.\n\n17\n00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.060\nWe talked about data center\ndesign in a prior episode.\n\n18\n00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.540\nWe've talked about the need to understand\nthe building blocks, the networking,\n\n19\n00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.380\nthe storage, the CPU, the RAM,\nthe compute resources of the host.\n\n20\n00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.790\nHow we interconnect them.\n\n21\n00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.670\nAnd the things that we would be concerned\nabout as a security professional\n\n22\n00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.160\nout beyond simply the concept\nof data management.\n\n23\n00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.600\nWe have to circle back to this idea of\nrisk because as we look at and analyze\n\n24\n00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.350\nrisk associated with cloud infrastructure,\nwe begin to see that no matter what we do,\n\n25\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.530\nthere are elements that\nwe have to control for\n\n26\n00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.350\nif we're gonna be\nsuccessful with security.\n\n27\n00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.020\nI do wanna circle back to something\nwe mentioned in a prior episode.\n\n28\n00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.060\nAnd I wanna just ask Daniel if he\ncan help me out for a minute, and\n\n29\n00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.490\nI know he is prepared to, cuz we actually\nset this one up ahead of time, and\n\n30\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.390\ndid not randomly decide to have Daniel\ngo out and search the internet for\n\n31\n00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.680\nsomething randomly, but we did mention\nin the episode right before this one\n\n32\n00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.850\nthat there are certain standards the data\ncenter designs may actually reference,\n\n33\n00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.490\nwe talked about, or I talked about and\nmentioned ASHRAE, and I talked about,\n\n34\n00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.270\nI mentioned the Uptime Institute, and\nso I thought it would be a good idea to\n\n35\n00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.400\njust go back quickly and show you what\nthose standards actually reference,\n\n36\n00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.580\nwhat they are,\nthe websites associated with them.\n\n37\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.870\nSo if we can go to Daniel's machine for\n\n38\n00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.085\njust a minute,\nwe have the ASHRAE website up first.\n\n39\n00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:05.645\nASHRAE is going to be\nthe group that controls for\n\n40\n00:02:05.645 --> 00:02:09.425\nat least its writing documentation and\nhelping us understand about temperature\n\n41\n00:02:09.425 --> 00:02:13.372\nand humidity, among many other things in\ndata center design, they are a global\n\n42\n00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:17.292\ninformation group that it gives\nguidance everywhere around the world.\n\n43\n00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:21.852\nSo you could see just on their website,\nenergy efficiency and things having to do\n\n44\n00:02:21.852 --> 00:02:26.462\nwith design and power management is really\nkind of the focus of where they are and\n\n45\n00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:27.552\nwhat they are doing.\n\n46\n00:02:27.552 --> 00:02:32.780\nBut I had you Daniel, search for\na specific document on the website.\n\n47\n00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.700\nAnd we went out and searched for the 2011,\n\n48\n00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.180\nbecause that's the latest\nversion of the current guidance.\n\n49\n00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.170\nGaseous and Particulate Contamination\nGuidelines for Data Centers and,\n\n50\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.940\nas you said to me when I said, bring this\nup, why are we looking at gaseous and\n\n51\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.110\nparticulate contamination\nconcerns with data centers?\n\n52\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.060\nWhat possible reference point?\n\n53\n00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.358\nWhat possible relevancy could this have?\n\n54\n00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:55.490\nAnd this just happens to be the formal\noperational name for the document.\n\n55\n00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.400\nIt builds on 2008 study that was done\nat about every three or four years,\n\n56\n00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.270\nthey put out updates,\nif necessary on this, but\n\n57\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.920\nthis happens to be a broad document that\nyou probably saw as you went through\n\n58\n00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.800\na little bit of it, that deals with a lot\nof different elements as I mentioned.\n\n59\n00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.550\nHVAC filtration standards\nwith regards to dust and\n\n60\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.370\nparticulate intake on the HVAC system,\nbut I believe it's page 15?\n\n61\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.590\n>> Page 15, right around there.\n\n62\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.825\n>> Somewhere around there.\n\n63\n00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:21.360\nDan is going to scroll down.\n\n64\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.380\nIn here there is a specific area aside\nfrom all the things you can kind of read\n\n65\n00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.210\nthrough and see if you're interested.\n\n66\n00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.750\nThat is I think right that table right?\n\n67\n00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.930\n>> A little more to go.\n\n68\n00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.770\n>> One more to go so I'm not gonna\nnavigate Dan is cuz he can actually see\n\n69\n00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.060\nI'm just looking at it from far away but\nhe's gonna show us the section in there\n\n70\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.740\nthat deals specifically with humidity and\nwith temperature,\n\n71\n00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.850\nalso thermal guidelines for\ndata center environments and protection,\n\n72\n00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.430\nthey've got some just scientific\ngraphing done to kind of reference and\n\n73\n00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.375\nlayout the argument, and then the real\ntake away, table three there.\n\n74\n00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.915\nWhich is gonna be the ASHRAE\nrecommendations for environment, for\n\n75\n00:03:58.915 --> 00:04:00.435\ntemperature, and moisture.\n\n76\n00:04:00.435 --> 00:04:01.805\nWhich is the said reference and\n\n77\n00:04:01.805 --> 00:04:06.255\nbuilt on the original 2008 document\nthat comes out and first lays this out,\n\n78\n00:04:06.255 --> 00:04:10.305\nas you can see, is gonna provide for\nus the critical piece of information.\n\n79\n00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:15.000\nLow end temperature, high end temperature,\nlow end moisture, high end moisture.\n\n80\n00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.250\nAnd you will see that we have earlier\nversion referencing all the way back\n\n81\n00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.970\nto 2004.\n\n82\n00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.840\nNotice it is done in both Celsius and\nFahrenheit, because depending on where you\n\n83\n00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.670\nare in the world,\nmost people will use the Celsius scale.\n\n84\n00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.280\nNot everybody does, but so that way if you\nare using either one, you can translate I\n\n85\n00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.080\ncan never do the math, so I'm like, yeah,\nwhatever that says, that's what you'll do.\n\n86\n00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.070\nBut you'll see, that we have actually\ndropped the low end temperature.\n\n87\n00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.670\nAnd, gone from 20 degrees back in 2004\nas a recommendation, to 18 degrees now.\n\n88\n00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.670\nSo we've dropped down by\napproximately a four degree gradient,\n\n89\n00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.800\nwhat we think the low end temperature,\nfor operation should be.\n\n90\n00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.830\nThe high end temperature,\n\n91\n00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.690\nyou'll see in 2004 is recommended at 25\ndegrees Celsius is now upwards to 27.\n\n92\n00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.700\nSo, it's gone up by again by\napproximately about three and a half,\n\n93\n00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.040\nalmost four degrees.\n\n94\n00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.708\nAnd then moisture in 2004 is recommended\nat 40% relative humidity and\n\n95\n00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:13.390\na dew-point of approximately,\nit looks like 42 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n96\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.150\nAbout five and a half degrees Celsius.\n\n97\n00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.920\nSomething like that, it looks like.\n\n98\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.050\nAnd then you will see that the high end\nmoisture point is about 55% relative\n\n99\n00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.250\nhumidity in 2004 and then it is now\nup to about 60% relative humidity.\n\n100\n00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.780\nSo it's gone up a little bit and you can\nsee that we're raising those standards.\n\n101\n00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.410\nAnd you know, if you think about\nthe impact global warming is having,\n\n102\n00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.780\nthink about the impact of the concerns\nwe're having with in general just weather\n\n103\n00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.600\naround the world.\n\n104\n00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.470\nYou can see how there may be some\nvariation in these temperatures.\n\n105\n00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.890\nAlso, The reality is that systems have\ngotten more efficient, essentially, and\n\n106\n00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.990\nare running better, are better at power\nconsumption, better at cooling and\n\n107\n00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.790\nbetter at heating.\n\n108\n00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.530\nAnd as a result, we can modify and\nplay with those temperatures.\n\n109\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.230\nSo this is the kind of\nimportant reference document.\n\n110\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.770\nOne of two that we will take a look at or\nat least one or two.\n\n111\n00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.580\nAreas we would look at to understand data\ncenter design at a more technical level.\n\n112\n00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.650\nAnd as, Dan, you actually had pointed\nout when I asked you about the TPM and\n\n113\n00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.360\nthe HSM, the hardware security modules,\ntrusted platform modules,\n\n114\n00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.910\nin that reference that we\nhad in that session as well.\n\n115\n00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.720\nWe went through and talked about all\nthis and I said hey have you seen these.\n\n116\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.260\nYou said well I wasn't really\non the architecture side,\n\n117\n00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.830\nI was on the implementation side.\n\n118\n00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.430\nBut when I did this work we would\nimplement these systems and\n\n119\n00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:25.690\nI'm familiar with them so I would probably\nsee them in production or have to interact\n\n120\n00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.850\nwith them but I wasn't necessarily\ninvolved in the design of them.\n\n121\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.980\nAnd when you're doing design as an\narchitect you're going to reference this\n\n122\n00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.100\nkind of document or\n\n123\n00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.040\nat least reference these standards\nto understand how to build.\n\n124\n00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.000\nThe proper kind of infrastructure to\ncreate the safe operating environments\n\n125\n00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.130\nthat allow us to ensure availability and\n\n126\n00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.560\nif you remember we talked a couple\nof times in different areas about\n\n127\n00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.170\ninformation security being really\nall encompassing right and\n\n128\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.720\na holistic solution and we often talk\nabout the three pillars of information\n\n129\n00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.880\nsecurity which are confidentiality\nintegrity and availability.\n\n130\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.710\nAnd data center design is\nfocused on all three, but\n\n131\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.790\nespecially availability with regards\nto the nuts and bolts functional specs\n\n132\n00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.660\nthat we have to align with in order to\nbuild, and to do that we are essentially\n\n133\n00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.270\nbuilding risk management and\nsecurity right into the design.\n\n134\n00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.730\nWe're managing down risk\nthrough high temperature,\n\n135\n00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.640\nlack of availability to be able\nto provide adequate cooling or\n\n136\n00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.040\nevacuate heat, and\ncontrol moisture can lead to compromise.\n\n137\n00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.150\nAnd this is a security related concern.\n\n138\n00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.250\nWe also, I know, have the Uptime Institute\nthat we took a look at.\n\n139\n00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.010\nOr actually to go out and\ntake a look for it as well.\n\n140\n00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.860\nSo we go back to the system, we'll see\nthat the Uptime Institute has a website.\n\n141\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.110\nAgain, would be good for\nyou to go out and take a look at.\n\n142\n00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.420\nI think we have the map, right?\n\n143\n00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.630\nWe wanna take a look at\nthe concentration map.\n\n144\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.160\nWhich was gonna be on the main area there.\n\n145\n00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.420\nSo I think it was on the main rotator,\nright, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n146\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.840\n>> Yeah,\nit's probably on this guy right here.\n\n147\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.130\n>> So\nyou may just have to go through there.\n\n148\n00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.890\n>> There it is.\n>> It's right there.\n\n149\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.448\nSo we wanted to go through and show you\nthat on the UptimeInstitute website,\n\n150\n00:07:53.448 --> 00:07:56.783\nthey actually have a really cool\ninteractive map Which maps out the data\n\n151\n00:07:56.783 --> 00:08:00.580\ncenters that they have certified around\nthe world by geography, as you can see.\n\n152\n00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.080\nYou can hover over and click on\nany one of those little pinpoints.\n\n153\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.880\nRandomly choose one.\n\n154\n00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.391\nAnd you'll get a little profile of\nwhatever data center that happens to be\n\n155\n00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:11.060\nthat they are referencing.\n\n156\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:15.140\nGives you some information on the data\ncenters in that geography, and\n\n157\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.170\nyou'll notice also off to the right\nin the very far right column\n\n158\n00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.490\nit explains what tiers\nthey are certified at.\n\n159\n00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.580\nTier one, tier two,\ntier three, and or tier four.\n\n160\n00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.615\nAnd these tiers are the standard four tier\nmodel that the uptime institute has put\n\n161\n00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:32.100\nout, and really now, worldwide is\naccepted as the standard way to measure\n\n162\n00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.720\navailability, reliability, and management\nwithin the data center industry.\n\n163\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.650\nAnd you could see that they've got\nthe level of the certification for\n\n164\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.790\nwhatever data center\nwe're taking a look at.\n\n165\n00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:45.800\nWhether it's tier three or\nit's tier one or tier two or tier four.\n\n166\n00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.950\nAnd we'll wanna reference those tiers,\n\n167\n00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.070\nthere's actually documentation on\nthe site that specifically shows you.\n\n168\n00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:53.640\nWe don't have to go through it,\npeople can find it, but\n\n169\n00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.330\nmy point is there's actual documentation\nthat will show you what each tier is.\n\n170\n00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.570\nWhat the standards are in terms of\navailability, uptime, control systems,\n\n171\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.630\nback end management, all the things\nthat are built in, there's a rather\n\n172\n00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.550\nlong laundry list of items you have to be\nable to build in and ultimately certify\n\n173\n00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.910\nas you move up the maturity scale, from\ntier one all the way up through tier four.\n\n174\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.350\nBut this is the kind of infrastructure\nmanagement guidance that a CCSP\n\n175\n00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:23.110\nwould look for with regards to\ndata-centered design and risk management\n\n176\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.990\nwith the associated obviously standards\nthat we can reference to be aligned and\n\n177\n00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.100\nreally make sure we\nare managing the right way.\n\n178\n00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.370\nSo both ASHRAE and the Uptime Institute\nprovide this kind of guidance.\n\n179\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.990\nSo as we begin to talk\nabout risk management and\n\n180\n00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.180\nwe look backwards a prior episode to\na data center design conversation.\n\n181\n00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.630\nWe see the two come together and\nwe see that really,\n\n182\n00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.820\nwe have to be aware of risks\nin every part, in every area\n\n183\n00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.280\nof our design to ensure that we're\nmanaging them as efficiently as possible.\n\n184\n00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.440\nAnd the management of risk within\nthe Cloud needs to be linked to\n\n185\n00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.100\ncorporate governance, needs to be\nlinked to enterprise risk management.\n\n186\n00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.470\nWe have to have that same thought\nprocess that flows through all elements\n\n187\n00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.780\nof our network, all elements of our\ninfrastructure brought into the Cloud.\n\n188\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:04.310\nBut remember,\n\n189\n00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.650\nas we are bringing it into the Cloud,\nwe are giving things away in the Cloud.\n\n190\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.350\nWe are usually, ultimately, right,\n\n191\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.630\ngonna enter into some sort of outsourced\nposting agreement, and we're gonna have to\n\n192\n00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.680\nbuild trust with that hoster,\nwhoever the Cloud service provider is.\n\n193\n00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.305\nI said hoster not toaster, by the way.\n\n194\n00:10:19.305 --> 00:10:19.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n195\n00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.080\nSo, with whoever the hosting party is,\n\n196\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.950\nthe Cloud service provider, we have to\nthink about how to manage through them.\n\n197\n00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.330\nAnd essentially use them to help us\nto validate and manage our risks,\n\n198\n00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.250\nbecause we're not necessarily gonna have\ncontrol over a lot of these elements.\n\n199\n00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.130\nWe're not going to have control\nover data center design.\n\n200\n00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:40.680\nWe're not going to have control over what\ntier of data center the vendor builds,\n\n201\n00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.600\nalthough we can decide with our money\nwe can vote by going to a vendor\n\n202\n00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.100\nthat offers multi tier\ndata center design support\n\n203\n00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.610\nto say I want to host in\nthis kind of data center.\n\n204\n00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:54.700\nI may pay a premium to host in a level\nthree versus level four data center but\n\n205\n00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.320\nif I want that kind of\nhosting that's what I'll do.\n\n206\n00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.240\nSo, I have the capability to do that,\nbut I probably don't have\n\n207\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.350\nthe ability to understand whether their\nmanaging to the ASHRAE standards or not.\n\n208\n00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.110\nSo, that's something to consider.\n\n209\n00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.750\nYou ever feel sometimes, your talking and\nall of a sudden you got people walking by\n\n210\n00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.600\nand their doing things, they stop\nrandomly and try to get your attention,\n\n211\n00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.590\nbut you don't wanna pay attention them,\nso you pretend they're not there.\n\n212\n00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:19.200\nBut then they do something really crazy\nand stupid and make you laugh, but you\n\n213\n00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.110\ndon't wanna laugh on camera so you have to\nbe continuing to talk about your stuff.\n\n214\n00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.830\nIt's kind of like being\nan animal in the zoo, right?\n\n215\n00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.020\nBeing on display and\npeople are watching you.\n\n216\n00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.870\nDon't feed the presenter right?\n\n217\n00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.800\nAnd don't throw peanuts at people,\nit's not nice.\n\n218\n00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.730\n>> I saw people throwing cigarettes\nat an alligator one time.\n\n219\n00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:33.875\nThat was an interesting thing.\n\n220\n00:11:33.875 --> 00:11:35.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> Was the alligator smoking?\n\n221\n00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.810\n>> He did not attempt to pick one up and\npartake.\n\n222\n00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.120\n>> He probably waited until you\nleft cuz he wanted to be nice.\n\n223\n00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.250\nHe was being sensitive to that.\n\n224\n00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.100\n>> He would be smoke shamed.\n\n225\n00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n226\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.010\nThat's the thing right?\n\n227\n00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.790\nThey will probably be sitting back\nwhen no ones around smoking a cigar,\n\n228\n00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.540\ndrinking a scotch.\n\n229\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.080\nI'm sure that's the life after hours\nat the zoo that we don't see, right?\n\n230\n00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.973\n>> Those are our random\nside warning coming up.\n\n231\n00:11:53.973 --> 00:11:56.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> What was that movie with Paul Blart?\n\n232\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.520\nThe one where he was the zoo keeper..\n\n233\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.080\nWhere the animals actually talk?\n\n234\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.700\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n235\n00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.490\n>> And he's make friends with the gorilla,\nthey go to TGIF.\n\n236\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.340\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n237\n00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:06.070\n>> Right, so Thank God It's Fridays.\n\n238\n00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.100\nAnd he goes to TGIF and the gorilla's\ndriving, right, and the whole thing.\n\n239\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:10.865\nSo I forget.\n\n240\n00:12:10.865 --> 00:12:12.203\n>> Paul Blart, zookeeper, I guess.\n\n241\n00:12:12.203 --> 00:12:13.440\n[LAUGH]\n>> Something like that, yes.\n\n242\n00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.350\nBuddy, that was a great movie.\n\n243\n00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.630\nSo, it's like life after\nhours in the zoo right.\n\n244\n00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:17.550\nOr Madagascar,\n\n245\n00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:20.390\nwhere you have all the animals hanging\naround doing all sorts of stuff.\n\n246\n00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:21.550\nThe penguins, right.\n\n247\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.310\nThe cool penguins.\n\n248\n00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.780\n>> They are cool.\n>> There are all sorts of things that go\n\n249\n00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:24.690\non when you are not around.\n\n250\n00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.250\nThis happens in the data center as well.\n\n251\n00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.450\nThey turn those places into roller discos\nat night when nobody is around, or\n\n252\n00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.060\nhockey rinks, people in there\nplaying full contact sports.\n\n253\n00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.990\n>> With SSD drives.\n\n254\n00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:34.980\n>> With SSD drives, when nobody is around.\n\n255\n00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.940\nBecause they have no moving parts,\nso you can safely do that,\n\n256\n00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.240\nthey won't get damaged.\n\n257\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.720\nSo it's just kind of interesting right,\nbecause when we think about risk and\n\n258\n00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.330\nmanaging risk We have to account for\nall the unknown things.\n\n259\n00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.290\nAnd I was joking a minute ago,\n\n260\n00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:48.000\nwhen I was talking about being distracted\nwhen other people walk by, but the reality\n\n261\n00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.690\nis, these are the kind of things when you\ntranslate them into our world, right.\n\n262\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.170\nOur discussion here.\n\n263\n00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.706\nThat we actually have to think about.\n\n264\n00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:58.750\nAccounting for th eunlooked for, the\nunanticipated, the unknown, is actually\n\n265\n00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.610\none of the most important things as a CCSP\nthat we would have to be prepared to do.\n\n266\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.850\nEven though we may never need\nto deploy that solution.\n\n267\n00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.560\nWe should at least be thinking ahead about\nwhat would happen if that did come to\n\n268\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:14.620\nfruition or if that situation somehow\ncame home to roost what would we do?\n\n269\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.920\nAnd so being proactive and really as\nI often talk about with students and\n\n270\n00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:19.470\ncustomers, planning for\n\n271\n00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:23.150\nsuccess is one of the most important\nskills that a CCSP can have.\n\n272\n00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:29.730\nBecause if we don't plan for success even\nby, essentially, ignoring the things that\n\n273\n00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:33.860\nwe are not gonna take on, and pretending\nthey don't exist, we are planning to fail.\n\n274\n00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.260\nBut if we do it through ignorance,\nif we do it through misapprehension or\n\n275\n00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.440\nmisunderstanding or misdirection or\nwhatever it may be, ignorance being\n\n276\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.450\ncertainly at the heart of a lot of that,\nwe still are making a choice, consciously.\n\n277\n00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.080\nBut we're choosing not to react.\n\n278\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.040\nWe're choosing not to plan.\n\n279\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.510\nWe're choosing not to be prepared.\n\n280\n00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.160\nAnd that in and of itself is planning,\nbut it's planning for\n\n281\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.090\nfailure as opposed to planning for\nsuccess.\n\n282\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.770\nAnd as a CCSP, it ultimately is\nour responsibility to manage risk\n\n283\n00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.330\nacross the enterprise, through good\ngovernance, and with an understanding\n\n284\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.480\nof what that will mean in any system,\nfor any reason, in any area.\n\n285\n00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.160\nNow it's hard to be prepared for\neverything.\n\n286\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.720\nI get that.\n\n287\n00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.860\nI understand that.\n\n288\n00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.250\nUniversal preparation is not something\nyou can really achieve just like a zero\n\n289\n00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:19.210\nrisk result is not something that we\ncan actively look to expect to see.\n\n290\n00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.330\nWe can manage towards that,\n\n291\n00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.690\nwe can always say hey, we wanna\nmange risk down in the organization.\n\n292\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.540\nBut the reality is it's almost\nimpossible to get rid of all risks.\n\n293\n00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.390\nIt's almost impossible to\ndeal with all concerns and\n\n294\n00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.640\nbe prepared for any eventuality.\n\n295\n00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.210\nSo you're a real world example of this,\nright?\n\n296\n00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.150\nWhen we think about some massive\nweather events that have happened\n\n297\n00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.920\nover the last decade,\nyou think about Katrina.\n\n298\n00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.770\nHurricane Katrina in New Orleans and\nthe Louisiana bayou, right?\n\n299\n00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:46.300\nAnd you think about the catastrophic\nimpact that storm had.\n\n300\n00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.710\nYou think several years back,\nalthough later on, then superstorm, or\n\n301\n00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:55.000\nrather Katrina, you think about superstorm\nSandy on the East Coast and New York and\n\n302\n00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.570\nthat area as it came in and\ndid the horrendous damage that it did.\n\n303\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.770\nThese were and had been built as\nonce in 100 year events, right?\n\n304\n00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.110\nAnd when we think about\nonce in 100 year events,\n\n305\n00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.410\nwhat I talk about when I speak on risk,\nis that you know they occur, but\n\n306\n00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.760\nthen just occur once in\n100 years on average.\n\n307\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.920\nThat doesn't mean that\nthey're not gonna happen.\n\n308\n00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.580\nIt just means that the time cycle\nassociated with them is so long\n\n309\n00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:20.740\ntraditionally that they may not happen in\nthe amount of time that is relevant to us.\n\n310\n00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.250\nBut that doesn't mean that it won't\nhappen at some point in the future.\n\n311\n00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.220\nAnd we have to be thinking about\nthe fact that we have to plan for\n\n312\n00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.790\ntheir occurrence even though we may not\nthink of them as being relevant today.\n\n313\n00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.680\nAnd so you know when I was growing up and\nI got to the point roughly, 15 or\n\n314\n00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.470\n16 years old at the time, when I was\ngrowing up, where I could get my license,\n\n315\n00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.760\nget your learner's permit I\nthink they called it back then,\n\n316\n00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.880\nrestricted license whatever\nthey call it today.\n\n317\n00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.421\nAt least in Florida at the time, when I\nwas 15, I could get a restricted licence,\n\n318\n00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:50.865\nand I could essentially have the right to\nstart driving under certain restricted\n\n319\n00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:51.490\nconditions.\n\n320\n00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:54.615\nI could drive only during the day,\nI could drive to go to work,\n\n321\n00:15:54.615 --> 00:15:58.764\nunder certain conditions, if I had a job,\nI could go to school I couldn't drive at\n\n322\n00:15:58.764 --> 00:16:02.090\nnight unless I had an adult in\nthe car with me, that kind of thing.\n\n323\n00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.308\nAnd that's still the case\nI think in many states and\n\n324\n00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:06.650\nmany areas in\nthe United Stated anyway today.\n\n325\n00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.220\nBut you know the reality is\nwe anticipate that risk so\n\n326\n00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.460\nwhen the insurance company says to my\nparents at a certain point in time hey\n\n327\n00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.230\nyou have kids, right,\nwell how old are they?\n\n328\n00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.620\nAs they profile you, they look ahead\n15 years and say, okay, so at 15 or\n\n329\n00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.180\n16, Johnny's going to want to start\ndriving, Johnny's going to get a licence,\n\n330\n00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:29.410\nguess what, we're going to give you a bill\nthat's going to essentially say by the way\n\n331\n00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.860\nJohnny is driving you're going to pay\na premium increase for insurance.\n\n332\n00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.910\nAnd if Johnny is not driving tell us,\n\n333\n00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.290\nyou don't have to pay until\nyou put Johnny on the policy.\n\n334\n00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.420\nBut we assume when Johnny turns 15,\nthat Johnny is going to want to a license.\n\n335\n00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.770\nSo as a result we're going to assume that\nyou're going to want to start adding them\n\n336\n00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:45.340\nto your policy.\n\n337\n00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.280\nNow many insurance companies will do this.\n\n338\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.520\nThis happens in a variety of areas,\nvariety of reasons.\n\n339\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.160\nBut, risk anticipation is what we're\ntalking about here essentially.\n\n340\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.780\nBeing proactive and planning ahead.\n\n341\n00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.845\nThe insurance company is\nsaying hey it's likely,\n\n342\n00:16:57.845 --> 00:17:00.485\nwe're going to have more risks\nwhen Johnny starts driving.\n\n343\n00:17:00.485 --> 00:17:04.215\nCuz he or she is a lot more likely to bang\ninto something as they're learning how to\n\n344\n00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:08.195\ndrive than when they are 30 or\n40 years into that process and\n\n345\n00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:10.377\nthey've become, hopefully, a good driver.\n\n346\n00:17:10.377 --> 00:17:14.377\nAnd so as a result we're gonna hit you\nwith a premium in order to insure that\n\n347\n00:17:14.377 --> 00:17:18.927\nwe're gonna cover that risk if Johnny runs\ninto something while he's learning how to\n\n348\n00:17:18.927 --> 00:17:22.637\ndo a three point turn or learning how to\nparallel park or whatever the case may be.\n\n349\n00:17:22.637 --> 00:17:25.827\nI have the pleasure of having to do\nthat right now with my oldest one.\n\n350\n00:17:25.827 --> 00:17:29.487\nShe actually got her restricted permit,\na learner's permit already.\n\n351\n00:17:29.487 --> 00:17:32.767\n>> You just terrified me because I have\na two year old and another one on the way\n\n352\n00:17:32.767 --> 00:17:36.170\nand I just realized,\nI'm gonna have to do that one day.\n\n353\n00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.380\n>> Yes, and\nthen my wife made it very clear.\n\n354\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.660\nThey're yours and they're always mine\nwhen something like this comes up.\n\n355\n00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.470\nThey're yours and as a result,\n\n356\n00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.670\nyou get the pleasure of teaching\nyour oldest how to drive.\n\n357\n00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.780\nAnd so, you know, it's interesting because\nmy oldest said, hey, I want the license.\n\n358\n00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:51.699\nShe wanted it,\nall of her friends were getting it.\n\n359\n00:17:51.699 --> 00:17:54.740\nShe wanted it, so she did the right thing,\nshe did the course.\n\n360\n00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.610\nThis is kind of cool.\n\n361\n00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:58.540\nThey do driver's ed online now in schools,\nat least in Florida.\n\n362\n00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:02.350\nSo she has never set foot in an\nautomobile, but yet she has gone through\n\n363\n00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.540\ndrivers ed, passed with flying colors,\ndid it all online, went studied for\n\n364\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.480\nthe drivers test, went and took the test,\ngot her restrictive permit,\n\n365\n00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.230\nhas never spent a second behind the wheel\nin the operational position of a car.\n\n366\n00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.610\nYet she is licensed to drive.\n\n367\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:23.320\nFear ye, all of you, all of you, who are\non the road anywhere in the United States.\n\n368\n00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.130\nThis child is now in\ncommand of a motor vehicle.\n\n369\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.175\nShe actually is not because we\ndon't let her behind the wheel.\n\n370\n00:18:28.175 --> 00:18:29.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But she doesn't know how to drive,\n\n371\n00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.390\nshe has the license but\nshe doesn't know how to drive.\n\n372\n00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.950\nBut I find that fascinating because when I\nwent to school when you did driver's ed,\n\n373\n00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:36.295\nyou did driver's ed.\n\n374\n00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:40.610\nMr Roberts was my teacher right as many of\nus probably had, he was the guy who did\n\n375\n00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.630\nlike all the different things in\nschool he was the phys ed teacher,\n\n376\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:48.410\nhe was the driver's ed guy or whatever and\nyou went and did a semester course.\n\n377\n00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.330\nAnd you actually got behind\nthe wheel of the car.\n\n378\n00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.440\nIf you sat in those cars, you remember\nthey have the extra brake for the teacher,\n\n379\n00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.000\nso they would sit in the passenger\nseat and could stop the car.\n\n380\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.350\nAnd you got to drive,\nI don't know, several hours.\n\n381\n00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.760\nBy the time you got done rotating\nthrough all the people in the class,\n\n382\n00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.440\nyou got to put in 6, 10, 12 hours behind\nthe wheel to learn the basics on that\n\n383\n00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.510\nlittle narrow course they\nwould send you through.\n\n384\n00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:08.690\nAnd then you went and did the whole\ntest and the whole nine yards.\n\n385\n00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.530\nThey don't do that today, it's all online.\n\n386\n00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.770\nYou don't ever drive and\nit's up to then somebody to teach you.\n\n387\n00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.280\nSo every time I would say, hey,\n\n388\n00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.780\ndo you want to go learn,\nit's the weekend, let's go do that?\n\n389\n00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:18.970\nNo I'm not interested in doing that.\n\n390\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.500\nShe doesn't want to drive,\n\n391\n00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.560\nshe just wants the license to show\nher friends that she has the license.\n\n392\n00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.070\nSo, sometimes risk actually do\nmaterialize but sometimes they don't.\n\n393\n00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.360\nAt some point she will ultimately\nget behind the wheel of a car and\n\n394\n00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.880\ndrive, I'm assuming, but for\nnow she's not interested in doing that.\n\n395\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.390\nBut we have to plan for that fact, right.\n\n396\n00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.900\nSo I have to notify my insurance company.\n\n397\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.460\nI have to notify the neighbors, don't\nleave anything out that you might not want\n\n398\n00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.370\nher to run over, dogs, kids, pots,\nwhatever, do all that stuff.\n\n399\n00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.550\nBut this is actually what we gotta\nthink about as certified cloud\n\n400\n00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.510\nsecurity professionals.\n\n401\n00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.030\nWe've gotta think about what are the risks\nwe may face, our infrastructure may face,\n\n402\n00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.130\nand even if the bad actor never attempts\nto hack in, even if we never have\n\n403\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.670\na resource attack that attempts to\nbleed resources out of the system.\n\n404\n00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.550\nIt's created in our service event.\n\n405\n00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.820\nEven if we never have a breach\nbecause of an insider threat.\n\n406\n00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.070\nWe may, and we have to be prepared\nat least to understand how to drive\n\n407\n00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:15.760\nintimate response if that happens,\nwe have to have policies, procedures,\n\n408\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.810\nprocesses, documentation, all of the\nworking tools that the risk manager needs.\n\n409\n00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:25.340\nYou know a lot of companies today\nare creating chief risk officer positions.\n\n410\n00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:31.730\nCRs or CROs in the sea sweep or chief\nprivacy officer, CPOs, or risk managers,\n\n411\n00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.860\nor privacy professionals or in the US,\nin the government, in the military,\n\n412\n00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:40.550\nwe see IA, information assurance functions\nthat tend to deal with this kind of stuff.\n\n413\n00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:45.020\nThey are recognizing, many businesses are,\nthat risk is a serious concern,\n\n414\n00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:49.340\na serious affair, and we have to dedicate\nresources to it all the time in order to\n\n415\n00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.940\nmanage it effectively, so risk assessment\nand analysis is very very important right.\n\n416\n00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:57.500\nWe have to think about policy and\norganizational-based risk.\n\n417\n00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.480\nHow do we manage these things?\n\n418\n00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.690\nHow do we document them?\n\n419\n00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:04.090\nWe should have usage policies that dictate\nwhat the expectations are for customers,\n\n420\n00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:09.830\nas well as for individuals that are gonna\nconsume one or more services in the cloud.\n\n421\n00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.740\nWe may get some of that\nguidance from our provider.\n\n422\n00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:17.910\nWe showed you in a prior episode the ten\nquestion fact, the FAQ that Microsoft\n\n423\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.790\npublishes for Office 365 on their website\nwith regards to being a customer and\n\n424\n00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.020\nkind of what your rights and\nexpectations and responsibilities are,\n\n425\n00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.570\nas well as the provider's, and\nhow they kind of split that up and\n\n426\n00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.640\ngive you guidance about\nthe various things they do.\n\n427\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.410\nAnd then they invite you to follow\nup with additional information and\n\n428\n00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.730\nadditional resources, right?\n\n429\n00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:38.780\n>> Adam,\nshould we default to a prepare for\n\n430\n00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.480\nthe worst mindset when it comes\nto our security platform?\n\n431\n00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.980\n>> Should we default to a prepare for\nthe worst mindset?\n\n432\n00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:45.800\nSo, you know,\n\n433\n00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.530\nI think it's important to understand that\nwe should always be prepared, right?\n\n434\n00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:52.500\nKind of the Boy Scout motto we reference,\nright?\n\n435\n00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.140\nAlways be prepared, but\nI don't know that necessarily plan for\n\n436\n00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:58.980\nthe worst is maybe the best way\nto frame that conversation.\n\n437\n00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.230\nI think that what happens\nwhen you plan for\n\n438\n00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:05.630\nthe worst is that when it doesn't happen,\nyou tend to get lax.\n\n439\n00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.200\nYou say well, you know, bad things\nhaven't happened, so I can ease up.\n\n440\n00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.000\nI don't have to be as vigilant.\n\n441\n00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.070\nThe sky isn't falling, the Chicken Little\nsyndrome that we often talk about, or\n\n442\n00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.950\nPeter Cries Wolf, or\nwhatever you want to call that.\n\n443\n00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:23.960\nAnd as a result of that, it's very hard\nto maintain a state of hyper vigilance,\n\n444\n00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.900\nalways be prepared, is not the same thing\nas my god the worst things are gonna\n\n445\n00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:31.390\nhappen, and I've gotta be ready\nto deal with those things.\n\n446\n00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:35.160\nIt's very hard for an organization,\neven for an individual to maintain that\n\n447\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.178\nlevel of over sight, and that level\nof preparedness over long terms.\n\n448\n00:22:40.178 --> 00:22:44.520\nActual, scientific, psychological studies\nshow the stress involved with that for\n\n449\n00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.980\nindividuals let alone for groups of\nindividuals is detrimental to health and\n\n450\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.880\nultimately over time is impossible to\nessentially maintain a role forward.\n\n451\n00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:56.660\nSo I don't like to tell customers hey\nassume that somebody's gonna show up with\n\n452\n00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.900\na tank and blow up your building tomorrow\nand then what are gonna do when they\n\n453\n00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.910\nroll through the walls and\ncome to steal the severs?\n\n454\n00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:07.660\nBecause the likelihood of that happening\nis very, very infinitesimal compared to\n\n455\n00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:12.070\nthe likelihood somebody may try to\nhack into an individual server,\n\n456\n00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.690\nbecause they're probably doing\nthat hundreds of times a day,\n\n457\n00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:19.625\nover the course of the average span of\noperational environment that you maintain\n\n458\n00:23:19.625 --> 00:23:22.405\non that system, and\nthat's very likely to happen.\n\n459\n00:23:22.405 --> 00:23:25.265\nSo let's talk about what\nyou should be prepared for\n\n460\n00:23:25.265 --> 00:23:31.300\nthat's on the column of need to do\nversus the column of you know in a super\n\n461\n00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.010\ncrazy world where the zombie apocalypse\nhas happened, yes this may occur.\n\n462\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:36.410\n>> So prepare for the likely worst.\n\n463\n00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.836\n>> Prepare for\nthe I would say probably prepare for\n\n464\n00:23:39.836 --> 00:23:44.803\nthe operational concerns that we\ncan realistically forecast out and\n\n465\n00:23:44.803 --> 00:23:48.484\nsay are likely to occur with\nsome assurance right so\n\n466\n00:23:48.484 --> 00:23:53.536\nas I said bad actors attempting to\ngain access to highly prized systems\n\n467\n00:23:53.536 --> 00:23:58.610\nlike databases like web servers\nlike directory services are likely.\n\n468\n00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.489\nPeople attempting to run cars through\nthe walls of the data center to\n\n469\n00:24:03.489 --> 00:24:08.112\nbreech are unlikely unless you\nare running a military grade data\n\n470\n00:24:08.112 --> 00:24:11.720\ncenter with country level\nsecure intelligence.\n\n471\n00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.250\nAnd then you may have to worry\nabout an armed force coming and\n\n472\n00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.420\ntaking it away from you.\n\n473\n00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.340\nBut you're gonna have guards and guns and\nyou're gonna be able to probably mount\n\n474\n00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.519\na defense that's appropriate\nto that level of threat.\n\n475\n00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.210\nSo we do want to make sure we're\nappropriate with our planning.\n\n476\n00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.970\nI think it's a very good point to make.\n\n477\n00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.620\nBut what I don't want to\nto is scare my customers.\n\n478\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:33.020\nScare my students into thinking they\nhave to plan for the zombie apocalypse.\n\n479\n00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.110\n>> No fear mongering.\n\n480\n00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.020\n>> No fear mongering.\n\n481\n00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.420\nAt least not personally.\n\n482\n00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.520\nI may do it through a third party, or\ndark proxy if I don't like you, but\n\n483\n00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.280\nI won't do it on purpose so\nyou wont know it's me.\n\n484\n00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:41.805\nRight\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n485\n00:24:41.805 --> 00:24:44.440\n>> But I don't want you as a customer,\n\n486\n00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:50.300\nas a student to think that a darkness\non the horizon always indicates doom.\n\n487\n00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.860\nI do want you to think that\nthe darkness on the horizon\n\n488\n00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.130\nindicates a need to start paying attention\nto the weather, because we may or\n\n489\n00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.710\nmay not see a condition\nthat we have to respond to.\n\n490\n00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.290\nSo I want situational and operational\nawareness in my risk managers, but I don't\n\n491\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:08.230\nwant them walking around and looking as if\nthe end of the world is about to happen.\n\n492\n00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.180\nBecause they're not gonna really,\nat that point, be able to turn and\n\n493\n00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.790\ndeal with issues in real-time.\n\n494\n00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:16.560\nThey're gonna be so focused on that\nevent that is, indeed, either so\n\n495\n00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.780\nfar out or unlikely to occur.\n\n496\n00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.840\nThey're not gonna see the train wreck\nthat's happening in real-time, typically.\n\n497\n00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.620\nAnd when they do turn to respond to it,\nit's usually too late and too little.\n\n498\n00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.690\nAnd it actually causes the exact opposite\nthing that we wanna have to happen,\n\n499\n00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.870\nwhich is we want them to be focused on\nthe here and now but be prepare for\n\n500\n00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.960\nthe eventuality.\n\n501\n00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.730\nAs opposed to be focus on the eventuality,\nnot be prepared for the here and now, so\n\n502\n00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.800\nwe wanna flipped that around a little bit.\n\n503\n00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.840\nSo risk assessment analysis occurs in\nmany levels of the organization, we have\n\n504\n00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.250\ntactical risk, policy and organizational\nbase risk, risk in a virtualization stack.\n\n505\n00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:49.350\nHow do we deal with VM's?\n\n506\n00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.950\nHow do we deal with the hyper visors?\n\n507\n00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.510\nHow do we deal with VM escape?\n\n508\n00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.080\nHow do we deal with VM hopping?\n\n509\n00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.150\nThese are attacks and\nsome concerns we may have to deal with or\n\n510\n00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.410\nhave to be concerned about.\n\n511\n00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.860\nHow do we deal with legal risks?\n\n512\n00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.590\nThe risks of governance and\ncompliance are very important.\n\n513\n00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:05.940\nAre we running our systems in such a way\nthat we are breaking the law, essentially?\n\n514\n00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:10.140\nAnd if so, are we exposing ourselves and\nour customers to that risk?\n\n515\n00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.710\nIs our supply chain gonna\nprovide risk to us?\n\n516\n00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.150\nIs our vendor running their system\nin a way that's breaking the law?\n\n517\n00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.760\nAnd we're now inheriting that risk without\neven knowing it because they essentially\n\n518\n00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.610\nare passing it to us,\nthat could also potentially be an issue.\n\n519\n00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.580\nWhat about non-cloud specific risks,\nrisks that don't apply to the cloud but\n\n520\n00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.010\ncould impact us anyway.\n\n521\n00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:31.705\nSo we may for instance,\nas I said a moment ago in the supply chain\n\n522\n00:26:31.705 --> 00:26:35.875\nbe buying services from a vendor\nthat are not specific to cloud.\n\n523\n00:26:35.875 --> 00:26:38.775\nHard drives generically right\nthey're not specific to cloud but\n\n524\n00:26:38.775 --> 00:26:40.755\nthey are an operational\ncomponent of storage and\n\n525\n00:26:40.755 --> 00:26:42.435\nwe do certainly use storage in the cloud.\n\n526\n00:26:42.435 --> 00:26:45.245\nBut we use hard drive outside the cloud\nat least last time I checked we\n\n527\n00:26:45.245 --> 00:26:46.255\nwere anyway right.\n\n528\n00:26:46.255 --> 00:26:49.765\nSo we still write stuff to hard drives\nright, we still need network cards,\n\n529\n00:26:49.765 --> 00:26:52.395\nwe still need CPU's and\nRAM to build systems.\n\n530\n00:26:52.395 --> 00:26:54.020\nWhether they're in the cloud or not.\n\n531\n00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.010\nWhat if we get that information?\n\n532\n00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.270\nWhat if we get that system hardware?\n\n533\n00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:02.560\nWhat if we get that product from\na vendor that has been compromised\n\n534\n00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:07.110\nby a hacking group that has inserted\na root kit into the firmware\n\n535\n00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.360\nof that operational\nenvironment in some way?\n\n536\n00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.390\nWe are inheriting that risk, even\nthough it's not specific to the cloud.\n\n537\n00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.500\nWe may propagate it out into the cloud.\n\n538\n00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.290\nWe may also choose not to use it\nin the cloud, just keep it local.\n\n539\n00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:21.160\nBut the point is,\nsupply chain risk is a huge issue.\n\n540\n00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.160\nCan you do me a favor while we're talking?\n\n541\n00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.510\nCan you google NIST supply chain risk?\n\n542\n00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:30.300\nAnd then you're going\nto find a NIST SP 800?\n\n543\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.510\nI think it's 160 or\n161 if I remember correctly?\n\n544\n00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:36.050\nDocument, and we should be able\nto bring up a PDF link for that,\n\n545\n00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.270\nI know you're working on that.\n\n546\n00:27:37.270 --> 00:27:40.290\nSo when you get that up and running and\nyou're ready, we just wanna take a look.\n\n547\n00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.170\nThere we go, NIST 161,\nlook it, I was right.\n\n548\n00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:43.610\nThat's so awesome.\n\n549\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.430\nAnd I did that from memory,\ncuz I had not thought about that.\n\n550\n00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:48.770\nBut this is one of\nthe documents that is CCSP,\n\n551\n00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:50.460\nyou would at least wanna be aware of.\n\n552\n00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.000\nLet me be clear, to prepare for\n\n553\n00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.360\nthe exam, you should not read\nthis document cover to cover.\n\n554\n00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.950\nThis is a United States take on\nsupply chain risk management\n\n555\n00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.270\nin the federal information system.\n\n556\n00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.480\nSo this is specific to the US government,\nbut the general concepts in here\n\n557\n00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.115\nare valuable for you as a CCSP with\nregards to supply chain risk management,\n\n558\n00:28:11.115 --> 00:28:15.145\nwhether you work in the US or\nwork in any country anywhere in the world.\n\n559\n00:28:15.145 --> 00:28:19.225\nBecause common sense does not know\na national boundary or border, right?\n\n560\n00:28:19.225 --> 00:28:22.937\nI mean, it's good common sense to\nunderstand the supply chain and the risk\n\n561\n00:28:22.937 --> 00:28:26.587\nassociated with it regardless of where you\noperate your infrastructure is my point.\n\n562\n00:28:26.587 --> 00:28:31.087\nThis document happens to provide really\ngood guidance from the perspective\n\n563\n00:28:31.087 --> 00:28:34.277\nof if you have these issues,\nthese are the things you want to do.\n\n564\n00:28:34.277 --> 00:28:37.097\nSo it's a good way to\nreference this conversation.\n\n565\n00:28:37.097 --> 00:28:40.937\nSo managing through non-cloud specific\nrisks would be an example with\n\n566\n00:28:40.937 --> 00:28:41.937\nregards to supply chain.\n\n567\n00:28:41.937 --> 00:28:44.227\nSo this is one of the things\nyou may want to look at.\n\n568\n00:28:44.227 --> 00:28:46.807\nWe also have to think about policy and\norganizational based risk,\n\n569\n00:28:46.807 --> 00:28:48.350\nas I said a moment ago.\n\n570\n00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.700\nThings like provider lock in,\nwould be a concern here.\n\n571\n00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.540\nIf we go with a specific big\ndata provider in the cloud, and\n\n572\n00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.570\nwe use Hadoop or Horton, or whatever\nthe big data analytic platform is.\n\n573\n00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:05.610\nOr we're on sales force as I mentioned\nwhere we have hosted application SAS.\n\n574\n00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.060\nWe may be locked in to that platform\nbecause of proprietary API's and\n\n575\n00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.160\ndata standards that may make it harder for\nus to migrate.\n\n576\n00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.220\nVendor lock in is becoming less and\nless of an issue today.\n\n577\n00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.240\nBut it is still an issue in the cloud.\n\n578\n00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.910\nIt's a policy and organizational based\nrisk that we have to assess for.\n\n579\n00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:25.210\nWe may have a policy that stipulates that\nany cloud provider we choose to go with\n\n580\n00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:29.660\nas an organization must provide\na vendor-neutral way to migrate our\n\n581\n00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.770\ndata out of the platform so we do not\nget into a vendor lock-in scenario.\n\n582\n00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.470\nWe may be smart enough to\nproject ahead and envision that.\n\n583\n00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.450\nWe may not be.\n\n584\n00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.710\nSo, it really just depends on\nhow we choose to manage that.\n\n585\n00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:42.910\nLoss of governance,\ncompliance-based risks, provider exit.\n\n586\n00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.190\nForget about vendor lock-in.\n\n587\n00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:45.970\nWhat if the provider goes out of business?\n\n588\n00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:46.780\nWhat are we going to do then?\n\n589\n00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.980\nHow do we get our data back?\n\n590\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:48.770\nThis is that old.\n\n591\n00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:51.410\nHorse and cart argument.\n\n592\n00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.420\nWhich one comes first chicken or the egg?\n\n593\n00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.600\nThe problem ultimately is,\nthat while it's less and less likely\n\n594\n00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.690\ntoday that cloud vendors are gonna come\nand go quickly in the market, if you go\n\n595\n00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:04.790\nwith a very small vendor in a niche area,\nyou may actually have this problem.\n\n596\n00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.730\nIf you're hosting with a very\nlarge vendor, Microsoft, Google,\n\n597\n00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:11.600\nAmazon, they're probably not going\nout of business anytime soon.\n\n598\n00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:15.220\nEven if one of them, in theory,\ntries to buy the other, right?\n\n599\n00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.550\nDell just bought EMC with\nJones VMware recently.\n\n600\n00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:22.340\nSo you've got a major shift in\nthe cloud playing field, right?\n\n601\n00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.560\nYou've got two major\nvendors in storage and\n\n602\n00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.630\nvirtualization being bought up by\nanother major player, major vendor,\n\n603\n00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.810\nin the infrastructure and services space,\nbut they're all still doing business.\n\n604\n00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:33.370\nThey're not going out of business.\n\n605\n00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:36.290\nVMWare is not going to stop\nmaking virtualization products.\n\n606\n00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:40.130\nEMC is not gonna stop selling\nmillion dollar SAN solutions, right?\n\n607\n00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:44.020\nSo as a result of that, we're not worrying\nabout them going out of business.\n\n608\n00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:49.660\nBut cloud company ABC right over here in\nthe corner that's got 100 customers and\n\n609\n00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.850\na niche market may very well go\nunder if things go badly for them.\n\n610\n00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:57.160\nAnd so you gotta think about where you're\nhosting, or where the company's hosting,\n\n611\n00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.490\nbecause if the provider goes out, what\nare you gonna do to get your data back?\n\n612\n00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:03.302\nIt's one thing when you have provider\nlock and they have your data and\n\n613\n00:31:03.302 --> 00:31:06.000\nthey don't give it to you easily but\neventually you get it.\n\n614\n00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.619\nIf they go out of business overnight,\n\n615\n00:31:07.619 --> 00:31:09.800\nhow are you gonna get your\nstuff out of that system?\n\n616\n00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.580\nHow are your VM's gonna get migrated?\n\n617\n00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.730\nHow is your customer data, your CRM\ninformation gonna come off that platform?\n\n618\n00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:16.650\nThese are you know,\n\n619\n00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.180\nlegitimate and really big concerns\nwe would have to struggle with.\n\n620\n00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:20.860\nTechnical risks.\n\n621\n00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:24.920\nWe have to think about the fact that\nbecause the provider is scaling this\n\n622\n00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.440\ninfrastructure and managing the technical\nimplementation and the technical oversight\n\n623\n00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.210\nof it that the risks associated with this\nmay be abstracted from us as customers.\n\n624\n00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.460\nWe may not see them.\n\n625\n00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:36.570\nWe may not understand them.\n\n626\n00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:40.420\nIf the provider decides to go with\nDocker as a container solution.\n\n627\n00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.830\nAnd support and run their infrastructure\nthrough Docker to do automation and\n\n628\n00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.160\nessentially achieve a DevOps platform\nthat they can highly automate and\n\n629\n00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.000\nmanage to scale,\nthat may be good, it may not be.\n\n630\n00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.044\nBut as the customer, we may not know or\nunderstand that's happening,\n\n631\n00:31:54.044 --> 00:31:56.750\nand there are risk associated\nwith the use of that technology.\n\n632\n00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.725\nThe provider has to be skilled enough\nto understand how to scale as well as\n\n633\n00:32:00.725 --> 00:32:04.000\nto consolidate management to\nbe able to then grow in scale.\n\n634\n00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.600\nAnd control over technical risks is\nshifting outward to the provider in\n\n635\n00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.680\nthe cloud model, because we're no\nlonger managing that infrastructure.\n\n636\n00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.200\nWe don't get the call when\nthe system goes offline.\n\n637\n00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.900\nIt's the provider that does, and\nthe provider has to manage that.\n\n638\n00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.400\nThey have to scale up their skills\ninternally on their teams, and\n\n639\n00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.110\nthey've gotta understand how\nto manage that infrastructure.\n\n640\n00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:27.380\nVirtualization risks, as I mentioned as\nwell, and I hit on some of the highlights,\n\n641\n00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:31.370\nguest escape, VM hopping,\nthings like this can all be a problem.\n\n642\n00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.160\nWhat about an area people\noften forget about, snapshots,\n\n643\n00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.140\nwith regards to virtualized\ninfrastructure?\n\n644\n00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:40.800\nSnapshots essentially are bit-streamed\nimages of a memory state of that machine.\n\n645\n00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.210\nYou take that snapshot.\n\n646\n00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:46.180\nYou apply it to an empty instance, and you\nhave a running machine with, assuming you\n\n647\n00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:50.246\ncan map to the storage obviously,\nall the data associated with it.\n\n648\n00:32:50.246 --> 00:32:53.700\nIf a bad actor is able to\nget a hold of snapshots,\n\n649\n00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.920\nthey may be able to modify\nthe organizational structure or\n\n650\n00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.120\ninfrastructure associated\nwith the machine.\n\n651\n00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.140\nThey may be able to modify\nthe running state of that machine by\n\n652\n00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.220\ntime traveling backwards and\nchanging the configuration.\n\n653\n00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.380\nThis will probably be\nan internal bad actor, right?\n\n654\n00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.130\nAs opposed to an external one, cuz\nan internal one would have the ability to\n\n655\n00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.650\nmount that and see the storage and\nall the network connections necessary.\n\n656\n00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.450\nAn external bad actor would have to\noperate on the inside of the network\n\n657\n00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.240\nwith the proper credentials to\nessentially make use of that snapshot.\n\n658\n00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.490\nCuz a snapshot that is taken\noutside the organization\n\n659\n00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.420\nis really of no use to anybody because\nwhen you mount it, all the storage and\n\n660\n00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:32.220\nconfiguration components necessary to make\nthe VM work are not available to you.\n\n661\n00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.590\nYou can't map back to the storage,\nyou can't see the config files,\n\n662\n00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.860\nthe hard drive files, the BIOS files, the\nlog files, the swap files, whatever, so\n\n663\n00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.962\nthat VM's not gonna start up, even\nthough you have access to the snapshot.\n\n664\n00:33:42.962 --> 00:33:46.020\nBut on the inside connected to\nthe network where everything is,\n\n665\n00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.160\nyou could actually modify a running\nproduction environment and\n\n666\n00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.045\ntake a VM back to a prior state,\nwiping out configuration changes,\n\n667\n00:33:53.045 --> 00:33:57.955\nwiping out data, and essentially messing\nup the infrastructure in the process.\n\n668\n00:33:57.955 --> 00:34:00.055\nThis is a very, very big risk.\n\n669\n00:34:00.055 --> 00:34:01.765\nAnd it may happen by accident, right?\n\n670\n00:34:01.765 --> 00:34:05.415\nPeople that are essentially using\nsnapshots without realizing it\n\n671\n00:34:05.415 --> 00:34:09.365\nmay apply a different state of that\nsystem and change the operational state.\n\n672\n00:34:09.365 --> 00:34:12.179\nSo if we don't have good documentation and\ngood change control,\n\n673\n00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:15.450\nwe may see the sys come home to roost by\naccident without meaning to do it, and\n\n674\n00:34:15.450 --> 00:34:17.978\nthat would also be a very legitimate and\nvery big concern.\n\n675\n00:34:17.978 --> 00:34:20.594\nWhat about sprawl on\nthe virtualization side?\n\n676\n00:34:20.594 --> 00:34:25.750\nGrowing unrestricted infrastructure to the\npoint that we consume all the resources\n\n677\n00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.300\navailable for hosting, and we essentially\nrun out of room without meaning to.\n\n678\n00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:31.190\nWe can over subscribe our data stores.\n\n679\n00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.290\nWe can over subscribe\nthe physical resources on a host.\n\n680\n00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:39.250\nWe can ignore warnings from load\nbalancing technologies, like DRS or\n\n681\n00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:40.530\nwhatever it may be.\n\n682\n00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:42.480\nAnd we may then, as a result,\n\n683\n00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.540\nrun out of infrastructure to use during\ncritical times so we have to scale up.\n\n684\n00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.420\nRemember, one of the key hallmarks of\nthe cloud is elasticity, scale on demand,\n\n685\n00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.350\nscale up, scale out, scale down.\n\n686\n00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.510\nIf we're not able to do that, we\nessentially are restricting ourselves and\n\n687\n00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:58.460\nnot really securing and managing\nthe cloud in the appropriate way, and\n\n688\n00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.490\nthe risks associated with\nthat can be very problematic.\n\n689\n00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.410\nSpecific technical risks may include\nthings like management play in breaches,\n\n690\n00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:06.440\na bad actor getting in and\n\n691\n00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.500\ntaking control in the software defined\narea to repurpose and reprovision systems.\n\n692\n00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.480\nOur resource exhaustion, as I said,\ndeny all service attacks.\n\n693\n00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.990\nIsolation control failures, zoning and\nmasking, VLANing, things of this nature in\n\n694\n00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:22.942\na multi-tenant environment,\nif they are not implemented correctly, and\n\n695\n00:35:22.942 --> 00:35:25.599\nwe can essentially move\nbetween tenant systems and\n\n696\n00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.970\nsee each other's data\nis a tremendous risk.\n\n697\n00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:28.532\nAnd again,\n\n698\n00:35:28.532 --> 00:35:32.070\nthis is in the hands of the provider,\nnot in our hands as the customer.\n\n699\n00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.160\nThis would be an issue.\n\n700\n00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:36.410\nInsecure incomplete data deletion\nat the end of the data lifecycle,\n\n701\n00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.840\nwe've talked about this as well.\n\n702\n00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:39.420\nThis'll be another big risk.\n\n703\n00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:44.010\nIf we don't wipe those drives clean or\ncryptoshred those drives, as we talked\n\n704\n00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.460\nabout, then we may leave remnant\ndata behind that can be compromised.\n\n705\n00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.945\nSoftware related risks, control, conflict,\n\n706\n00:35:50.945 --> 00:35:53.575\nwhere we've got multiple management\nsystems trying to vie for\n\n707\n00:35:53.575 --> 00:35:56.555\nthe same control at the same time,\nthat can also be an issue.\n\n708\n00:35:56.555 --> 00:36:00.555\nWe've talked about legal risks and\njurisdictional concerns, the applicable\n\n709\n00:36:00.555 --> 00:36:03.570\nlaw versus the jurisdiction, and\nwe have to think about that.\n\n710\n00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:04.570\nWhat about licensing?\n\n711\n00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:07.840\nA lot of times, people will use software,\nespecially on like Amazon and\n\n712\n00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.350\nMicrosoft on the Azure fabric, where you\nbuy rights to use the running instance and\n\n713\n00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:13.560\nit's already pre-licensed, right.\n\n714\n00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:17.390\nSo, Amazon will give you\nserver 12 R-2 system, and\n\n715\n00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:19.890\nthey give you the operating system and\npass along with it.\n\n716\n00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:20.710\nI'm not suggesting for\n\n717\n00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.740\na minute that the vendor's not doing\nthe right thing on the licensing side.\n\n718\n00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.964\nWhat I am suggesting is that you have\na right in those systems to also create\n\n719\n00:36:26.964 --> 00:36:28.150\nyour own instances.\n\n720\n00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.670\nSo if you don't use the template\ndeployments that essentially are available\n\n721\n00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:35.690\nfor you, but you create you own VMs, if\nyou're not running licensed infrastructure\n\n722\n00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:39.080\nyourself, you actually are introducing\na risk into the platform.\n\n723\n00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.350\nThat can be a problem because we\ndo have to run licensed software.\n\n724\n00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:46.300\nThis is a requirement of operating of any\nenvironment today, not just in the cloud.\n\n725\n00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:49.960\nAnd if we're doing so\nin violation of our licensing agreements,\n\n726\n00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.640\nthat is a risk to the business,\nand we have to think about any or\n\n727\n00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.850\nall of these things,\nincluding non-cloud specific risks.\n\n728\n00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:59.020\nNatural disasters, weather events\nlike I spoke about, Katrina,\n\n729\n00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:04.470\nSuperstorm Sandy, social engineering,\nunauthorized facility access,\n\n730\n00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.480\ndefault passwords being left in place and\nbeing used, love that one, right?\n\n731\n00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.190\n>> That's a fantastic.\n\n732\n00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:12.190\n>> You can always walk up and\nget on there, all sorts of stuff, right?\n\n733\n00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:16.160\nAnd we talked about all these risks\nbecause these are the areas that\n\n734\n00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.610\nas certified cloud security professionals,\nwe have to think about and\n\n735\n00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:20.950\nreally be anticipating.\n\n736\n00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:24.800\nThis is that box that continues to grow\nbigger and bigger as we talk about risk.\n\n737\n00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.090\nAnd we have to anticipate and interact\nwith and operate in all of these areas to\n\n738\n00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:34.000\ntruly understand the kind of things that\nwe as CCSPs would deal with, but also that\n\n739\n00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.560\nour customers that we are working with and\nworking for are gonna have to anticipate.\n\n740\n00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.580\nAnd if they don't know about them, we have\nto then figure out a way to communicate\n\n741\n00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:45.170\nsecurely, communicate effectively\nto them the value of planning and\n\n742\n00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.060\nalso the impact of risk in the business.\n\n743\n00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.230\nIt's very, very important.\n\n744\n00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:51.310\n>> That's right, and while it is a risky\nbusiness getting into the cloud or\n\n745\n00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:55.810\nany other type of computing environment,\nand it's something we have to.\n\n746\n00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:57.887\nWe've seen today the importance\nof risk analysis,\n\n747\n00:37:57.887 --> 00:38:00.635\nwe have to see where are we vulnerable,\nand what can we do about that?\n\n748\n00:38:00.635 --> 00:38:03.508\nAnd when you add the element\nof the cloud you can remember,\n\n749\n00:38:03.508 --> 00:38:06.967\nevery component that you add to\nyour infrastructure, your network,\n\n750\n00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:10.560\nyour environment as a whole has its\nown inherent risks involved with it.\n\n751\n00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:15.829\nAnd you have to start looking and trying\nto find them, so that you can a, mitigate\n\n752\n00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:21.710\nthose risks, and b, hopefully remove all\nif you can, which is usually not possible.\n\n753\n00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.756\nBut as much as humanly possible,\n\n754\n00:38:23.756 --> 00:38:27.050\nremove that element as being\na probable risk for you.\n\n755\n00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:28.768\nAnd that's what it's all about,\n\n756\n00:38:28.768 --> 00:38:32.385\ncontinually reevaluating,\nreanalyzing the risks that are out there,\n\n757\n00:38:32.385 --> 00:38:36.140\nand when it comes to our cloud\ninfrastructure, that is no different.\n\n758\n00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:39.888\nAdam, we surely appreciate you pointing\nout these things is something what we\n\n759\n00:38:39.888 --> 00:38:43.918\nmight have not thought of, and with your\nyears of experience and expertise in this,\n\n760\n00:38:43.918 --> 00:38:46.290\nwe get to glean from that and\nwe appreciate it.\n\n761\n00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.988\n>> Stop, you're making me blush.\n\n762\n00:38:47.988 --> 00:38:50.310\n>> [LAUGH] He's going, stop, stop.\n\n763\n00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.440\n>> Just stop, just stop.\n\n764\n00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.276\nCertainly and I obviously always\nappreciate the opportunity to talk and\n\n765\n00:38:55.276 --> 00:38:56.405\nto talk about these things.\n\n766\n00:38:56.405 --> 00:39:00.150\nOne just quick thing in wrapping up to\nremind you, I didn't mention defense in\n\n767\n00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:04.410\ndepth in this particular episode, but we\ntalk about it so many places and so often.\n\n768\n00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.360\nIt's incredibly important here,\nespecially.\n\n769\n00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.040\nThe overlapping mutually reinforcing\nlayers of control that we build, so\n\n770\n00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.515\nthat way if a risk happens in one area,\nwe haven't anticipated it, but\n\n771\n00:39:13.515 --> 00:39:16.595\nwe have a control somewhere else that\nwill offset the impact of that risk.\n\n772\n00:39:16.595 --> 00:39:19.495\nWe still are essentially\nplanning to be successful.\n\n773\n00:39:19.495 --> 00:39:20.645\nAnd we really have to think about that.\n\n774\n00:39:20.645 --> 00:39:24.086\nBecause a lot of the risks we identified\nare gonna occur across multiple systems\n\n775\n00:39:24.086 --> 00:39:25.845\nand multiple areas at different times.\n\n776\n00:39:25.845 --> 00:39:30.035\nAnd we may not always be in the right\nplace at the right time to respond.\n\n777\n00:39:30.035 --> 00:39:33.020\nWe may not always be in the right\nplace at the right time to anticipate.\n\n778\n00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.157\nBut if we have overlapping controls,\n\n779\n00:39:35.157 --> 00:39:39.835\nmutually reinforcing systems that will\nessentially defend one another, right,\n\n780\n00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:43.420\nthen we are more likely to be\nsuccessful at risk management.\n\n781\n00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.060\nSo we have to think about that, and\nreally, who's gonna trust the provider,\n\n782\n00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.640\nwho's gonna manage the provider\nis one way to think about it.\n\n783\n00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.310\nBut more importantly, how are we as the\nsecurity professional and the provider,\n\n784\n00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.200\nthe cloud service provider, gonna work\ntogether, to build a better infrastructure\n\n785\n00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:00.480\nthat is gonna be more risk resilient,\nis really the question\n\n786\n00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.750\nthat we as CCSPs have to struggle\nwith as we wrap up our conversation.\n\n787\n00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:07.170\n>> Building a security relationship\nreally with our cloud provider,\n\n788\n00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.800\nthat's what we're kind of getting at here.\n\n789\n00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.960\n>> Yep.\n>> Well, that being said,\n\n790\n00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.890\nour clock has ticked away, and\nwe do appreciate you yet again.\n\n791\n00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.610\nWe appreciate you guys for\nwatching as well.\n\n792\n00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.700\nHopefully, you've gotten a lot out of\nthis episode, and maybe even enjoyed it.\n\n793\n00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.950\nThat being said, we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off for ITProTV.\n\n794\n00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:22.910\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n795\n00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:23.620\n>> I'm

it.\n>> Purple polka dots.\n\n27\n00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.540\nPurple socks, blue and white,\nand Purplish polka dots.\n\n28\n00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.148\nSo keeping with my polka dotted theme for\nthis particular series of [CROSSTALK].\n\n29\n00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:14.073\n>> We'll play the polka while\nyou show the polka dots.\n\n30\n00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:15.310\n[LAUGH]\n>> That would be awesome.\n\n31\n00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.970\nCloud polka as a service.\n\n32\n00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.530\nThat would just.\n\n33\n00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.925\nPolka as a service.\n\n34\n00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:20.375\nAnother version of PAS.\n\n35\n00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:21.435\nThat's PLAS, actually.\n\n36\n00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:22.245\n>> Yeah, PLAS.\n\n37\n00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:23.665\n>> PL, right, PLAS.\n\n38\n00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:27.255\nSo anyway, we'll get back to the work\nat hand here cuz we do actually have,\n\n39\n00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:29.985\nbelieve it or not, important stuff\nto talk about in this episode.\n\n40\n00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:32.385\nSo designing and\nplanning security controls.\n\n41\n00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:36.795\nAs we think about, we did have broaden\nour conversations around risk and\n\n42\n00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.655\ninfrastructure and\nthings we've been talking about.\n\n43\n00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:42.890\nWe spent some time detailing out\nthe thought process that a CCSP would go\n\n44\n00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.190\nthrough, with regards to risk management.\n\n45\n00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.090\nThe man made risks that are out beyond\nthe borders of our data center,\n\n46\n00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.730\nthings like weather,\nenvironmental concerns.\n\n47\n00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.470\nThe technical risks that we\ntransfer over to the cloud vendor,\n\n48\n00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.070\nthe non-technical risks\nlike bad actors internally.\n\n49\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.740\nThe legal risks associated with software\nusage and governance, the policy and\n\n50\n00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.260\norganizational risks associated with\ncloud-vendor lock in Vendor exit.\n\n51\n00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.230\nAll these different things,\nright, we have to consider.\n\n52\n00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.790\nAnd we have to think about physical and\n\n53\n00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.700\nenvironmental protections\nreally in a very forthright.\n\n54\n00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.990\nAnd focused way as a CCSP to understand\nhow to create the operational environment\n\n55\n00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.060\nthat will be secure that will be\nsuccessful that will lead us to be able to\n\n56\n00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.080\nrun the cloud infrastructure or\npartner with a vendor.\n\n57\n00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.200\nThat will provide that to us as part of\nour risk assessment risk mitigation and\n\n58\n00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.620\nrisk management solutions within our\nthought process as security professionals.\n\n59\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.000\nSo is the data center itself secure.\n\n60\n00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.340\nIs it a secure building?\n\n61\n00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.490\nI go to many data centers for\ncustomers on a regular basis,\n\n62\n00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.020\nand I've been to some very\ninteresting secure ones.\n\n63\n00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.560\nI've been to some very\nnondescript generic ones.\n\n64\n00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.580\nOne of our data centers that we used to\nhost at years ago, we don't anymore, but\n\n65\n00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.720\nas a company, globally, we used to,\nin Southern California.\n\n66\n00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.960\nIt was actually a rated data center.\n\n67\n00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.470\nIt was actually being used primarily,\n\n68\n00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.980\nalthough we did lease\nspace in it to co-locate.\n\n69\n00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.020\nAt the time we were going to the few\nprivate customers that was there.\n\n70\n00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.050\nIt was primarily for the government and\n\n71\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.840\nthe government was using\nthe majority of the data center.\n\n72\n00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.280\nThey had not built the data center,\n\n73\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.290\nbut it was built to certain\nspecifications they required.\n\n74\n00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.505\nAnd when we gotta tour the data\ncenter to decide with and\n\n75\n00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:20.635\nhow we wind up hosting there.\n\n76\n00:03:20.635 --> 00:03:22.755\nOne of the interesting\nthings we found out, and\n\n77\n00:03:22.755 --> 00:03:27.425\nI mentioned this I think in other shows\nfor other discussions we've had, in CISSP.\n\n78\n00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:30.615\nFor instance [INAUDIBLE] some of\nthe other conversations we may or\n\n79\n00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:35.075\nmay not have had, over time I've\nmentioned this particular data center,\n\n80\n00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:38.385\nit actually had kevlar built in\nto the walls of the data center.\n\n81\n00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:43.680\nSo interwoven in to the concrete walls\nwas about a two-inch layer of Kevlar.\n\n82\n00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.730\nAnd it was built that way specifically,\n\n83\n00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.720\nso that it would survive the execution of\nan attack from outside the involved anti\n\n84\n00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.510\ntank missiles that could\nbe fired at the building.\n\n85\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.580\nAs I said, the chances of somebody\nrolling up with a device like this and\n\n86\n00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.560\ntaking a shot if your building is small,\nbut I guess whatever reason.\n\n87\n00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.660\nThey though that this may actually happen.\n\n88\n00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.630\nSo the building was rated to actually\nsurvive an external explosion of\n\n89\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.650\na certain magnitude so\nthat the walls would not be breached.\n\n90\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.310\nAside from all the normal protections\nthey put inside with everything else.\n\n91\n00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.320\nSo that was kind of cool.\n\n92\n00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.445\nYou could essentially take\na bazooka in just shoot it and\n\n93\n00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:21.665\nyou would not be able to breach the walls\neither internally or externally, so.\n\n94\n00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:23.286\n>> I want to be a part\nof that testing process.\n\n95\n00:04:23.286 --> 00:04:23.857\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n96\n00:04:23.857 --> 00:04:26.056\nI wanted to be on site when they\nwere actually setting that up.\n\n97\n00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:27.565\nAl,l right George, stand the wall up,\n\n98\n00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.727\nlet's test that before we\nactually put the rest in place.\n\n99\n00:04:30.727 --> 00:04:33.757\nLet's make sure that anti tank round\ndoes not go all the way through.\n\n100\n00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:34.787\n>> Hot range [LAUGH].\n\n101\n00:04:34.787 --> 00:04:38.197\n>> That's just kind of crazy, but\nthat's the kind of stuff sometimes\n\n102\n00:04:38.197 --> 00:04:41.677\nthat you see so physical infrastructure\nobviously has to be considered.\n\n103\n00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:43.990\nThe environment around the data\ncenter has to be considered.\n\n104\n00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.420\nA lot of data centers actually are located\nrelatively close to fire houses or\n\n105\n00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.090\nfire response systems, so\n\n106\n00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.720\nthat way if there is a fire, the emergency\nresponders can get there fairly quickly.\n\n107\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.520\nYou will find that they tend to be in\nindustrial areas more often than not.\n\n108\n00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.340\nThey are usually very large\nnondescript buildings,\n\n109\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.160\nhundreds of thousands of square\nfeet if they're commercial.\n\n110\n00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.930\nAnd they're built to look\njust like any other office or\n\n111\n00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.370\nwarehouse space around them.\n\n112\n00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.680\nThere's no fancy signs.\n\n113\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.980\nWe don't put up the, hey, save data\nhaven here sign or something like that.\n\n114\n00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.950\nSo there are generic buildings if you\nknow what to look for you will spot them.\n\n115\n00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.200\nThey do tend to have a lot of\ncameras on the exterior so\n\n116\n00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.430\nthey tend to have a lot more security\nmaybe than some of these buildings do.\n\n117\n00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.580\nThey tend to be set back in such a way,\nthat there's not a lot around them.\n\n118\n00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.740\nYou can't drive right up to them,\nit's gonna be an elevated platforms.\n\n119\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.270\nOr, raised in such a way that you\ncannot drive from the street level,\n\n120\n00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.070\ndirectly up to the front of the building.\n\n121\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.380\nYou can simply drive up and park,\nbut there's an elevated staircase or\n\n122\n00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.340\nstructure that lends itself to protecting\nthe building from direct attack.\n\n123\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.620\nThere may not be glass walls and/or\nwindows on the ground level, and\n\n124\n00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.130\nif there are.\n\n125\n00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.670\nIt's simply in the admin space\naway from the actual hosting area.\n\n126\n00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.420\nHosting area's typically\ngonna be just concrete, and\n\n127\n00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.110\nthere's not gonna be any external\ngateways or entry points there.\n\n128\n00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.000\nExternal doors tend to be available, but\n\n129\n00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.500\nthey're available with no handles on\nthe outside for you to open, or pry open.\n\n130\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.260\nThey may be swipe card enabled,\nso you can open them, but\n\n131\n00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.830\nonly under certain conditions.\n\n132\n00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.360\nOr they're essentially one way doors,\nthey're made for exit.\n\n133\n00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.290\nBut you're not allowed to enter through\nthem and they tend to entry, or\n\n134\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.470\nthey tend to exit onto raised platforms.\n\n135\n00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.020\nSo, again, you can't walk right up\nto the door and fiddle with it and\n\n136\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.230\nthey tend to be in the open.\n\n137\n00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.070\nThere's no landscaping around them.\n\n138\n00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.770\nThey're well-lit, with typically high\nintensity lighting and cameras that\n\n139\n00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.270\nare focused on the pad, where you exit\nonto, the platform, so that anybody that's\n\n140\n00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.930\nout there for any reason, is observed and\nso these are the kind of design.\n\n141\n00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.280\nConstraints that we see, and when you\nstart to look at these buildings and\n\n142\n00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.840\nunderstand what they are and\nyou recognize them for\n\n143\n00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.300\nwhat they are, you begin to see all\nthe security systems that are built in.\n\n144\n00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.310\nThey will have generators certainly\nsomewhere associated with them so\n\n145\n00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.040\nyou can tell when you see a 30-foot pad\nwith a couple of generators on it and\n\n146\n00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.420\ndiesel tanks, that's obviously running\nsome pretty heavy-duty infrastructure.\n\n147\n00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.300\nBut they can be away from the building\nbecause of the concerns about explosions,\n\n148\n00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.350\nor the concerns about potentially somebody\ntaking that block of thermite and\n\n149\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.500\nputting it right on the diesel tank and\nsetting it off, so things like that.\n\n150\n00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.750\nAlso because of noise generation and\nthings that are concerning there.\n\n151\n00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.810\nWe tend to see the infacts\nsystems not on ground level, but\n\n152\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.520\ntypically up on the roof,\nwhich is not unusual in many buildings.\n\n153\n00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.360\nBut, they're up on the roof for\nlots of reasons.\n\n154\n00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.030\nNumber one we don't want people\nto go in and getting near them.\n\n155\n00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.970\nWe don't want scavengers coming in and\nstealing, you know, the piping and\n\n156\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.200\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n157\n00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.940\nThe copper wire is very valuable,\ntypically in the copper in the pipe, so\n\n158\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.640\na lot of times in abandoned buildings.\n\n159\n00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.840\nYou have scavengers come in and steal\nall that stuff out of the buildings, so\n\n160\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.820\nthat's a big issue.\n\n161\n00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.980\nBut from a security perspective, we want\nto keep them away from people that can get\n\n162\n00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.770\ninto them and potentially introduce\nforeign substances into the airflow.\n\n163\n00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.860\nSo we don't want you to be able to dump or\na biological agent\n\n164\n00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.190\ninto the HVAC system and propagate it\ninto the building, forcing an evacuation.\n\n165\n00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.830\nSo this is the kind of thing\nwe have to think about.\n\n166\n00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.684\nThe units are on the ground floor.\n\n167\n00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:00.122\nWe tend to see them fenced off,\nsecured and protected.\n\n168\n00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:01.504\nThey're not just sitting open.\n\n169\n00:08:01.504 --> 00:08:05.369\nThey tend to have perimeter fencing,\nprobably barb wire.\n\n170\n00:08:05.369 --> 00:08:09.730\nIn many cases, they may be an enclosed\nstructures that are carkey enabled.\n\n171\n00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.640\nThey're padlocked, and they typically tend\nto have cameras and surveillance systems\n\n172\n00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:17.460\nbuilt around them as well, because again,\nwe can't just have people walking up and\n\n173\n00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.350\npotentially being able\nto fiddle with systems.\n\n174\n00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.850\nYou may be able to execute\na denial of service attack and\n\n175\n00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.970\nevacuate the building just by\nturning off the HVAC system.\n\n176\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.080\nAnd allowing the ambient\nheat inside to rise.\n\n177\n00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.860\nBecause over time, when it gets too hot,\nthe systems can no longer run.\n\n178\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.940\nSo it maybe something as simple as cutting\nthe power, or cutting the HVAC system off.\n\n179\n00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.570\nAnd if you can gain access to it,\nyou may be able to do that.\n\n180\n00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.150\nSo these are the things we would\nbe really worried about and\n\n181\n00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.430\nhaving to think about, right.\n\n182\n00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.510\nSo network and communication facilities,\nhave to be safeguarded.\n\n183\n00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.675\nA lot of times this infrastructure's\nburied, so it's underneath the ground.\n\n184\n00:08:47.675 --> 00:08:50.710\nBut we always seem to find with our\nbackhoes as we're digging up for\n\n185\n00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.940\nvarious other things.\n\n186\n00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.240\nAnd I often wonder, do they have a system?\n\n187\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.780\nWhere they say, okay,\nthe fiber's here, right?\n\n188\n00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.330\nSo if you wanna have a fiber cut make sure\nyou dig in this area, but if you don't,\n\n189\n00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.120\ndig over here.\n\n190\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.870\nBecause randomly,\nit seems like no matter what they do.\n\n191\n00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.830\nAnd I know they know where their stuff is.\n\n192\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.090\nThey come out and do site surveys.\n\n193\n00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.390\n>> The signs say call before you dig.\n\n194\n00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.780\nThere's fiber optic piping.\n\n195\n00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.540\n>> But at the same time, you wind up with\na fiber cut almost every time they put\n\n196\n00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.860\na backhoe into a parking lot and\ndig something up, they cut fiber.\n\n197\n00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.530\nBecause these guys either\njust don't pay attention, or\n\n198\n00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.660\nwhich is equally bad when you're operating\nheavy machinery, or they just don't care.\n\n199\n00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:26.810\nI think it's probably\na combination of both.\n\n200\n00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.950\n>> I loved watching my solar winds map and\nthen you say why is the state down,\n\n201\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.364\nor half of the state down?\n\n202\n00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.583\nHow did that happen?\n>> It just gets crazy.\n\n203\n00:09:33.583 --> 00:09:36.490\nYou know that they know\nwhere these things are.\n\n204\n00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:38.540\nThey lay out the conduits,\nthey understand where they are.\n\n205\n00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.950\nThese days you see a lot\nof these big machines,\n\n206\n00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.250\nlike when they're in road construction.\n\n207\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.880\nThey've got the GPS sensors on them,\n\n208\n00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.710\nso they're actually able\nto plow in a straight line.\n\n209\n00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.590\nThey know exactly where they\nare to lay out the road.\n\n210\n00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.640\nBut they can't figure out\nhow not to cut fiber.\n\n211\n00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.148\nI just I never understand\nthis stuff when it happens.\n\n212\n00:09:52.148 --> 00:09:53.453\n>> They're aiming for it.\n\n213\n00:09:53.453 --> 00:09:56.333\n>> That's what I'm saying,\nI actually think it's like a video game,\n\n214\n00:09:56.333 --> 00:09:57.934\nthey're out there saying all right.\n\n215\n00:09:57.934 --> 00:10:00.958\nI'm gonna go and if I don't get\nit on my pass you come in and\n\n216\n00:10:00.958 --> 00:10:02.480\nwe'll do it on the next one.\n\n217\n00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.860\n>> I think it starts off with\nwatch this Earl [LAUGH].\n\n218\n00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.300\n>> Look at what I could do, right?\n\n219\n00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.450\nWe have to think about all that,\nplus end points.\n\n220\n00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.060\nWe always have to be thinking\nabout the risks associated with\n\n221\n00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.240\nprotecting the end point.\n\n222\n00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.399\nIn an undefined borderless network today,\n\n223\n00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.500\nthe network is wherever you\nactually are operating from.\n\n224\n00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.080\nAnd as a result of that if we've got\nmy laptop or Dan, your laptop or a hand\n\n225\n00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.050\nheld device, a phone or whatever for using\nthat connected to the corporate network.\n\n226\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.870\nWe essentially are the end point for\nthe Cloud.\n\n227\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:37.500\nI've got an app on my Blackberry\nharmon.ie is what it's called.\n\n228\n00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.010\nIt's a SharePoint portal app.\n\n229\n00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:43.250\nI can access our corporate SharePoint\nportal through Office 365 using the app on\n\n230\n00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.800\nthe Blackberry or\non any phone that runs on any platform.\n\n231\n00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.630\nIf it runs on the Blackberry,\nit definitely runs everywhere else.\n\n232\n00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.190\nSo you can use this thing, it's a very\ncommon app that Sharepoint will use.\n\n233\n00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.890\nAnd I use it all the time to access\nour internal Sharepoint portals and\n\n234\n00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.400\nlook stuff up, and\nget whatever I need from one\n\n235\n00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.385\nof my teams if I have a management\nconversation coming up.\n\n236\n00:11:01.385 --> 00:11:03.193\nSo I can access it in real time.\n\n237\n00:11:03.193 --> 00:11:05.855\nI run that on my Blackberry,\nmy Blackberry is a secure device,\n\n238\n00:11:05.855 --> 00:11:10.045\nit's not something anybody can get their\nhands on unless I leave it somewhere.\n\n239\n00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:13.475\nI don't know, randomly sitting on a chair\nsomewhere for instance, right, or\n\n240\n00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:14.607\nwherever it may be.\n\n241\n00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:17.977\nRight, but the point is, if I don't do\nthat while I'm concerned about the fact\n\n242\n00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:22.297\nthat that application potentially\ndoes have access into our system.\n\n243\n00:11:22.297 --> 00:11:26.417\nIf I'm good at physical security and I\ndon't compromise the device by leaving it\n\n244\n00:11:26.417 --> 00:11:29.857\nunattended, there's a relatively\nlimited risk window there.\n\n245\n00:11:29.857 --> 00:11:32.380\nSo, we have to educate our users.\n\n246\n00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.580\nWe have to be really focused\non security awareness and\n\n247\n00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.950\ntraining as CCSPs to ensure\nthat good usage habits.\n\n248\n00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.640\nGood policies are translated\ninto good procedures and\n\n249\n00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.030\ngood processes through actuation and\nimplementation.\n\n250\n00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.858\nWe have to then reinforce that behavior,\n\n251\n00:11:46.858 --> 00:11:50.880\nright, in order to make sure that people\ndon't leave those endpoints unattended.\n\n252\n00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.240\nKey regulations would\nhave to be aligned with.\n\n253\n00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.498\nIf we're in the power\ngeneration industries, NRBSP,\n\n254\n00:11:55.498 --> 00:11:57.770\nif we're in the healthcare industry,\nHIPAA.\n\n255\n00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.930\nIf we're in the financial services\nindustry, Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\n256\n00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:03.820\nIf we're in the banking industry,\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act in the US,\n\n257\n00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.790\nthe Banking Secrecy Act, right?\n\n258\n00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.920\nThese are things that we\nwould have to be aware of.\n\n259\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.880\nThe Basel Accords internationally for\nfinancial services firms.\n\n260\n00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:17.620\nThe Wassenaar Agreement and\nexport control regimes like Wausenauer,\n\n261\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.520\nwhich govern as I mentioned\nin one of our prior episodes,\n\n262\n00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.880\ndual use goods in computers and\nencryption algorithms.\n\n263\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.270\nAnd computer technology is actually\ncontrolled under this framework,\n\n264\n00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.300\nthis larger framework of weapons of\nmass destruction and dual use goods,\n\n265\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.950\nbelieve it or not.\n\n266\n00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.790\nSo you could use a computer to\nkill somebody by hitting them,\n\n267\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:39.790\nbut by also hacking into a system and\nessentially doing something to them.\n\n268\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.481\nSo we consider it to be a dual use good\nthat we actually control in certain cases.\n\n269\n00:12:44.481 --> 00:12:47.215\nCCSPs would have to\nunderstand these things and\n\n270\n00:12:47.215 --> 00:12:50.590\nbe aware of them as part of governance and\ncompliance.\n\n271\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.360\nThese are important things to consider.\n\n272\n00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.660\nTake stock for a moment,\nkind of a personal reflective movement.\n\n273\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.690\nDo we have any kind of om kind of music,\nright, we could do a little background,\n\n274\n00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:00.760\na little candlelight.\n\n275\n00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:01.580\nCan we lower the lights?\n\n276\n00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.990\nPut on some incense or something while I\nshare a moment with our studio audience.\n\n277\n00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.530\nSo, think about this for\na moment as you self-reflect.\n\n278\n00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.380\nHow many policies do you have\nin your organization typically?\n\n279\n00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.640\nAs an IT admin, as a security professional\npotentially, you would hopefully be aware\n\n280\n00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.090\nof the many policies your company\nhas on the books, so to speak.\n\n281\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.020\nOn average, most companies have,\n30, 40, 50 maybe even a hundred or\n\n282\n00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.650\nmore policies in large companies dealing\nwith all aspects of operation from\n\n283\n00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:30.070\nwhat you can do in certain situations.\n\n284\n00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:34.190\nA policy will typically govern behavior or\ngovern behavior.\n\n285\n00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:39.500\nWhat your expectation of privacy is,\ntypically zero or none in most companies.\n\n286\n00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.740\nWhether or not you can use it to\nassist them under certain conditions.\n\n287\n00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.680\nThese are things that\npolicies will govern.\n\n288\n00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.680\nWe have hundreds, in some cases, of\npolicies that we have to pay attention to.\n\n289\n00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.870\nThe CCSPs function,\none of them anyway in this regard,\n\n290\n00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.970\nis to translate external regulatory and\nstatutory concerns into policy.\n\n291\n00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.260\nSo we can essentially push risk\nmanagement through the organization,\n\n292\n00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.125\nand have good governance and\ngood compliance.\n\n293\n00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:03.420\nSo we have to be aligned.\n\n294\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:04.960\nSo the CCSP has to do this.\n\n295\n00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.880\nSo, we would implement policies or\ncreate policies\n\n296\n00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.900\nwhich would then ultimately be\ntranslated into process and procedure.\n\n297\n00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.850\nAnd should be aligned with controls.\n\n298\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:19.340\nControls are the operational mechanisms we\nput into place to achieve an end result.\n\n299\n00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.820\nBut to audit and validate that\nthat end result is being achieved,\n\n300\n00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.010\nbecause we have a mechanism that\nensures the right kind of behavior.\n\n301\n00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.880\nThe right kind of system, operational\nguidance, the right kind of environment,\n\n302\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.850\nwhatever it is.\n\n303\n00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.540\nSo a control could be something\nas simple as using a single\n\n304\n00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.580\nfactor authentication for\naccess to a system.\n\n305\n00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:40.089\nYou would have to do a biometric iris\nscan to access a secure facility,\n\n306\n00:14:40.089 --> 00:14:42.539\nmaybe the wiring closet or\nsomething like that.\n\n307\n00:14:42.539 --> 00:14:46.195\nSo for instance, the hotel that I'm\nstaying at while I'm doing this\n\n308\n00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:49.789\nwork on IT Pro TV for this group of\nepisodes you're watching us for,\n\n309\n00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:52.586\nis actually kind of,\nit's got most of the details.\n\n310\n00:14:52.586 --> 00:14:55.602\nIt's got high speed internet today,\nall sorts of stuff,\n\n311\n00:14:55.602 --> 00:14:57.765\npretty common everywhere you go.\n\n312\n00:14:57.765 --> 00:15:01.535\nBut on each floor of the hotel\nas you come off the elevator,\n\n313\n00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:04.895\nthey've always got the standard closet\nwhere they put all the linens, and\n\n314\n00:15:04.895 --> 00:15:06.185\nthat kind of stuff,\nright, so that's there.\n\n315\n00:15:06.185 --> 00:15:08.145\nBut then they also have a data access,\n\n316\n00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:11.435\na wiring closet on every floor,\nwhich you don't always see in all hotels.\n\n317\n00:15:11.435 --> 00:15:12.485\nDepends on the hotel.\n\n318\n00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:15.415\nIt's a relatively new hotel, right,\nas you know, it was built recently.\n\n319\n00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:17.325\nSo it's actually kind of a new design.\n\n320\n00:15:17.325 --> 00:15:20.080\nThey've actually got a separate\nwiring closet on every floor.\n\n321\n00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.220\nAnd it's got a card key lock,\na swipe key associated with it.\n\n322\n00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.070\nAll the locks in the hotel do, but\n\n323\n00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.230\nthe card key is programmed to a certain\nfrequency and/or a certain combination,\n\n324\n00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.690\na PIN,\nthat you essentially read into the reader.\n\n325\n00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.680\nWhen you put the smart card up against\nthe door lock, it has a mag-reader, and\n\n326\n00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.090\nessentially you put it up there.\n\n327\n00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:39.370\nAnd it reads the card,\nactivates it, and opens the door.\n\n328\n00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.680\nSo the room key is really only programmed\nfor your room, it's not programmed for\n\n329\n00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.710\nanybody else,\nit won't open anybody else's room.\n\n330\n00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.420\nIt's also because I tried it,\nnot programmed to open up\n\n331\n00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.400\nthe data access closet, because clearly\nwe don't want you in there as well.\n\n332\n00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:51.680\nBut you never know,\nyou just have to try it..\n\n333\n00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.383\n>> You're physically port\nscanning your own hotel.\n\n334\n00:15:53.383 --> 00:15:55.968\n>> It would have just been cool if it\nwas so I could go down and say hey,\n\n335\n00:15:55.968 --> 00:15:58.272\nby the way this is happening,\nand I could take a picture and\n\n336\n00:15:58.272 --> 00:16:01.534\nbe standing like a selfie, just\nstanding and the say, hey look, right?\n\n337\n00:16:01.534 --> 00:16:02.760\nI was able to hack the hotel.\n\n338\n00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.050\nBut the reality is clearly it's\nnot supposed to work that way.\n\n339\n00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.710\nWhile you may be able to get\ninto that room, I've actually\n\n340\n00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:10.890\nwalked by the times I've been here,\nand they've been in there working and\n\n341\n00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:14.288\nI've seen what's in there and I talked\nto the tech that was in there working.\n\n342\n00:16:14.288 --> 00:16:16.260\nAnd said hey, what are you guys doing,\nand how's it set up.\n\n343\n00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.980\nAnd it's kinda cool, but they lock out\nthe doors, specifically cuz they know\n\n344\n00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.800\nthe risk is somebody like me,\nor anybody, whoever it is,\n\n345\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.640\nthat may get curious about that, you don't\nwant them in there, so you lock the door.\n\n346\n00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.530\nNow the interesting thing is that they do\nthat, but then they actually have the sign\n\n347\n00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.340\non the wall, which I think is a\nregulation, they probably have to have it.\n\n348\n00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.430\nThat says, data access closet.\n\n349\n00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.550\nIt's in braille as well, so you obviously\nhave to have it for life safety reasons.\n\n350\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.100\nSo, people that may not be able to see\nthat, may have a visual impairment,\n\n351\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.020\nare able to read, or understand what\nthe doorway is, so they don't get lost,\n\n352\n00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.280\nand potentially confused as\nthey're trying to walk around.\n\n353\n00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.270\nSo I get the reasons why\nthey label the door, but\n\n354\n00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:51.560\nit's just interesting cuz you come off the\nelevator, the first, almost to the right,\n\n355\n00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.780\nas you come off the first thing you see.\n\n356\n00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.850\nIs, hey, this is the place where the\nhackers need to go to find all the stuff.\n\n357\n00:16:56.850 --> 00:16:59.030\nIt's got the big sign right there.\n\n358\n00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.810\nSo we would have controls\nassociated with this kind of stuff.\n\n359\n00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.850\nWe wanna create physical\nsecurity controls, logical and\n\n360\n00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:06.060\nadministrative controls.\n\n361\n00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.820\nThese are all areas that\nwe would focus on as CCSPs.\n\n362\n00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:12.180\nThe data center facility\nitself has to be secured.\n\n363\n00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.130\nWe have multiple protection rings and\ndefense in depth architecture,\n\n364\n00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.410\nwe've talked about there.\n\n365\n00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.530\nWe've talked about the hot and\ncold aisle separation.\n\n366\n00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.336\nWe've talked about the ASHRAE\ntemperature management standards.\n\n367\n00:17:22.336 --> 00:17:26.030\nTalked about the Uptime Institute and\ndata tiering, tier one, tier two,\n\n368\n00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.270\ntier three, tier four on the data\ncenter designs standards.\n\n369\n00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.240\nWe've talked about the importance of\nmaking sure that our data center teams,\n\n370\n00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.830\nthe individuals that are gonna be\ntasked by the cloud provider or\n\n371\n00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.690\nby us as an internal data center\nto manage the infrastructure\n\n372\n00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:44.550\nare trained appropriately so security\nawareness and training are very important.\n\n373\n00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:47.410\nJob specific skills, very important.\n\n374\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.890\nIncident response knowledge,\nvery important for these teams.\n\n375\n00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:52.800\nYeah there are things that will go wrong.\n\n376\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.490\nThere are things that will happen at\nthe randomest of times and hours, and\n\n377\n00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:59.760\nthe experts may not always be available\nto be on-call to respond to them, but\n\n378\n00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.680\npeople in the data center\nhave to be able to understand\n\n379\n00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.880\nwhat is expected of them\nat a certain level, right,\n\n380\n00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.680\nto be able to do those things,\nand to understand how to respond.\n\n381\n00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.800\nThey are literally the first responders.\n\n382\n00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.020\nThey may not be the ones who will\nultimately diagnose a malware\n\n383\n00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.040\ninfestation, right?\n\n384\n00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.250\nOr a DDOS attack.\n\n385\n00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.140\nBut they have to understand\nthe warning signs to be able to take\n\n386\n00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:22.770\nspecifically detailed actions to prevent\nthat attack from propagating or spreading.\n\n387\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.190\nMaybe they will disconnect a host so\n\n388\n00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:31.000\nthat the virtual machines on that host\nare running, but they're network isolated,\n\n389\n00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.130\nso essentially, they'll pull\nthe network connection from the host or\n\n390\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:38.020\ndisable the port on the switch or whatever\nthey'll do remotely to isolate, and\n\n391\n00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.270\nessentially sandbox that environment off.\n\n392\n00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.340\nAnd that may be all we expect them to do,\nbut they have to know how to do that and\n\n393\n00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.170\nbe trained to do that, and be aware of\nthe fact that that has to happen, right,\n\n394\n00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.120\nso instead of watching Simpsons\nreruns at two in the morning,\n\n395\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.408\nright when nobody's around.\n\n396\n00:18:51.408 --> 00:18:55.330\nThey gotta actually pay attention to the\nheads up display right on the screens, and\n\n397\n00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.790\nactually monitor with solar winds, as you\nwere talking about, or whatever it may be.\n\n398\n00:18:58.790 --> 00:18:59.990\nRight.\nThey've got to pay attention\n\n399\n00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.740\nto that stuff.\n\n400\n00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:05.220\nThere's lots of times that I'll walk in\non off shift hours or random hours to our\n\n401\n00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.890\nclient side, two in the morning,\ndoing work or whatever, during maintenance\n\n402\n00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.510\nwindow, they're in their humming along,\nthese guys are just heads down working,\n\n403\n00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.210\nthey're doing all the stuff they got\nto do because it's a 24 hour operation.\n\n404\n00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.756\nBusinesses don't stop a lot of times\ntoday and certainly bad actors don't.\n\n405\n00:19:19.756 --> 00:19:21.260\n[LAUGH] Let me make that clear, right?\n\n406\n00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:25.290\nThey're out there waiting on you\nbecause the best times, studies shown,\n\n407\n00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:29.890\nthey've done scientific and psychological\nstudies on human attention spans and\n\n408\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:33.930\nperiods times you can work and really be\nfocused, this is why there are strict\n\n409\n00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:36.965\nregulations for truck drivers for\ninstance can only drive so many hours.\n\n410\n00:19:36.965 --> 00:19:40.040\nBefore you must pull over and rest so many\nhours cuz you're, you know your ability to\n\n411\n00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.920\njust stay sharp and be aware is gonna\ngo down as you continue to do things,\n\n412\n00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.870\nespecially repetitive things like\ndriving that are just you know kinda\n\n413\n00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:51.370\nboring over time, just seeing\nthe same landscape roll by, and so\n\n414\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.120\nyou actually can cause an accident\nbecause you're not paying attention.\n\n415\n00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.810\nDevelop what's called tunnel vision,\nright?\n\n416\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.500\nAnd so there are very strict\nguidelines for this stuff and\n\n417\n00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.720\nyou know the bad actors, the hackers,\nknow this, when we teach hacking class and\n\n418\n00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.410\nwe talk, I talk a lot about\nthe psychology involved with this.\n\n419\n00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.170\nDuring shift change is usually the time\nyou wanna hit a business if you're gonna\n\n420\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.510\nhack into them or right at the very end\nof a shift, going into the last hour,\n\n421\n00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:16.620\nif you could figure out what\nthe timing cycle on a shift is.\n\n422\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.730\nBecause when somebody's been on for\nabout seven to eight, nine, ten hours,\n\n423\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:22.030\ndepending on the shift,\nat the end of that shift,\n\n424\n00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.800\nthey're gonna be a lot less\nfocused on paying attention.\n\n425\n00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.990\nThey're gonna kinda be in the zone and\n\n426\n00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.030\nreally worn down than they would be\nat the very beginning of a shift,\n\n427\n00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.210\nwhere they're checking all the settings,\ntaking the hand off.\n\n428\n00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.400\nMaking sure that whatever\nthey're doing is,\n\n429\n00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.530\nyou're really gonna align\nwith what's going on.\n\n430\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.490\nSo as they settle down and get into the\nrhythm you don't wanna be trying to attack\n\n431\n00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.350\nthem cuz they're gonna\nreally be paying attention.\n\n432\n00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.000\nAt the tail end of the shift when they're\nlooking forward to going home is when\n\n433\n00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.420\nthey're gonna stop paying as much\nattention and during switch over while\n\n434\n00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:50.870\nthere's a little confusion and chaos, it's\nthe perfect time to try to get in there.\n\n435\n00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.960\nSo we know this as bad actors.\n\n436\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.700\nWe also know this hopefully\nas security professionals so\n\n437\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:58.350\nwe've really gotta make sure that\nwe're paying attention to all\n\n438\n00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.440\nthe details associated with\nthis kind of stuff, right?\n\n439\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.680\nRaised flooring in the data center is\nused to create crawl spaces below and\n\n440\n00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.130\npotentially above if we have drop\nceilings for conduit, and for\n\n441\n00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.120\nthe ability to run piping and create\nairflow, and all that kind of stuff.\n\n442\n00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.570\nSo, we wanna be aware of all this as well.\n\n443\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:15.489\nIt's very, very important.\n\n444\n00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.330\nSystem and communication\nprotection equally important.\n\n445\n00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.200\nAll cabling needs to be run in\nthat conduit and secured so\n\n446\n00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.310\nit's essentially physically protected and\n\n447\n00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.930\nit should be shielded from external\nattacks in multiple different ways.\n\n448\n00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:32.810\nWe want to make sure that we are thinking\nabout the use of secure hypervisors,\n\n449\n00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:37.590\non the physical host side, as we abstract\nin to the virtualization environment, if\n\n450\n00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:41.370\nwe use an open source hypervisor that is\nnot tested, that we don't really know much\n\n451\n00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.230\nabout, who knows whether or not there's\nactually malware in the hypervisor,\n\n452\n00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.580\nwe don't know, there could be root kits\ninvolved, you never know what's there.\n\n453\n00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:51.350\nStorage controllers have to be vetted and\ntested, the firmware has to be managed and\n\n454\n00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:54.800\nupdated I've talked about in\nother areas and other discussions\n\n455\n00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.880\nthe fact that with patch management,\none of the things we tend to miss and\n\n456\n00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.820\nnot focus on is the need to\npatch manage our firmware.\n\n457\n00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.880\nIf we're not focused on that as part\nof a broader patch management cycle,\n\n458\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.420\nwe may miss a very big window for risk\nto creep into the organization, because\n\n459\n00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.240\nvendors do put out firmware upgrades, just\nlike they put out security patch upgrades.\n\n460\n00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.470\nIt's very, very important.\n\n461\n00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:18.670\nThe patching cycle we often talk about\nwith Microsoft, Patch Tuesday, and various\n\n462\n00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.250\nvendors like that, is something that, as\nan IT professional, in the cloud, we have\n\n463\n00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:25.160\nto pay attention to, just like we would\nif we owned the physical infrastructure.\n\n464\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.450\nBut, remember that a lot of times,\nthe vendor,\n\n465\n00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:31.630\nthe cloud service provider,\nis actually doing the patch management.\n\n466\n00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:35.260\nAs a result of that, we, as the customer,\nmay not have the ability or\n\n467\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.020\nthe right to be able to interact on\nthe security plane to deal with that.\n\n468\n00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:40.250\nThat could be an issue.\n\n469\n00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:42.160\nAnd if the vendor is\nnot keeping up with it.\n\n470\n00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.790\nIt may expose us and\nall the tenants around us to risk.\n\n471\n00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.612\nVolume management, we talked\nabout storage we have to zone and\n\n472\n00:22:48.612 --> 00:22:51.890\nmask our storage to insure that\nit's isolated from other people.\n\n473\n00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:57.880\nIP address management using DHCP and\nusing most likely either\n\n474\n00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.710\naddress reservations or static addressing,\nthat is taken out of an address pool so\n\n475\n00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.350\nwe know those addresses are set asides for\nspecific infrastructure.\n\n476\n00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.030\nHas to be coordinated So we know\nwhat addresses are in our block, or\n\n477\n00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:12.980\nsubnet we may use custom subnetting,\nclassless internet domain routing and\n\n478\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:15.890\nsupernetting and all the fun\nstuff that we could get into, but\n\n479\n00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.720\nwe're not gonna bore you with here, but\nwe could certainly do if we needed to.\n\n480\n00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.260\nAnd CCSPs have to understand these terms.\n\n481\n00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.120\nThey have to understand the concepts,\nand again know your limits, right?\n\n482\n00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:26.810\nAsk for help.\n\n483\n00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.100\nIf you don't understand\nwhat a subnet mask is,\n\n484\n00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.340\nthere's no shame in\nthat at all by the way.\n\n485\n00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.480\nNot everybody knows how to do subnetting.\n\n486\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.810\nNot everybody knows how to do classes in\ndomain routing or supernetting where you\n\n487\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:43.140\ncan borrow bits and essentially add\nhosts to your network infrastructure.\n\n488\n00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:44.640\nI keep hitting your machine.\n\n489\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.000\nAdd hosts in or add networks,\nand essentially have more or\n\n490\n00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.090\nless of one or the other.\n\n491\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:53.370\nDepending on the manipulation of the bits\nwithin that particular area of the subnet.\n\n492\n00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:56.140\nIf you don't understand the concept\nthere's nothing wrong with that at all.\n\n493\n00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:56.821\nRead up on it.\n\n494\n00:23:56.821 --> 00:23:58.587\nGet someone who understands\nit to help you.\n\n495\n00:23:58.587 --> 00:24:02.450\nGet someone to explain it to you, but\nultimately you are responsible For\n\n496\n00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.691\nthe concepts associated with it, whether\nyou understand it or not, and this is\n\n497\n00:24:06.691 --> 00:24:10.791\nsomething that as a security professional,\nyou really need take to heart.\n\n498\n00:24:10.791 --> 00:24:13.810\nYou may be relying on the vendor,\nthe cloud service provider,\n\n499\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.490\nand indeed you almost without exception\nhave to, in any model except where\n\n500\n00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.230\nyou are essentially the cloud\nprovider with private on-prem cloud.\n\n501\n00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.390\nAnd even then, you're relying on\na provider, but it's the external ISP,\n\n502\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.610\nthe Internet service provider, give you\nexternal IP addresses that are routable.\n\n503\n00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.440\nBut internally,\nyou're providing the IP infrastructure.\n\n504\n00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:36.340\nThe DHCP servers, the subnet ranges,\nyou're doing all of that.\n\n505\n00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.190\nBut if it's gonna be a hosted cloud\nsolution with a third-party provider,\n\n506\n00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:42.240\nthe provider's giving you the DHCP range.\n\n507\n00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.017\nThe provider is managing\nthe DHCP infrastructure.\n\n508\n00:24:45.017 --> 00:24:48.010\nThe provider is doing\nthe reservation set asides for\n\n509\n00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.150\nyou and setting up the address blocks and\ndoing all of that.\n\n510\n00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.300\nSo if you don't know enough to understand\nwhat you need and ask, you may or\n\n511\n00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.810\nmay not get what you need.\n\n512\n00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.930\nThey will have to set up the VLANs for\nyou.\n\n513\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.040\nYou may or may not have rights to do that\ndepending on the kind of infrastructure\n\n514\n00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:01.840\nthat you're running.\n\n515\n00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.780\nIn a SaaS model, you have no exposure to\nany of that, it's all managed for you.\n\n516\n00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.940\nYou're simply given an API and an address,\nand log in here, and that's all you know.\n\n517\n00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.800\nIn IIS, you would have to set all that up\nyourself because you're given the rights\n\n518\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.830\nto essentially manage the infrastructure,\nand you would have to then work with\n\n519\n00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:22.430\nthe vendor most likely to understand what\nthe dedicated pathways are to connect.\n\n520\n00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:26.090\nBut you would then be able\nto control DHCP in your area\n\n521\n00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:27.970\non your infrastructure yourself.\n\n522\n00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.170\nSo you would have to understand how\nto do those things, it would be very,\n\n523\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.870\nvery important for\nyou to be aware of that.\n\n524\n00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.210\nSecurity group management, role-based\nmanagement and delegation of authority\n\n525\n00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.880\nwould be something that security\nprofessionals have to consider.\n\n526\n00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.720\nVirtual machine imaging,\nhow are we gonna deal with that?\n\n527\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.500\nHow are we gonna inspect the virtual\nmachines running on the hypervisor?\n\n528\n00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:50.090\nUsing VMI, we'll talk more about\nVMI in an upcoming episode, but\n\n529\n00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.770\nVirtual Machine Inspection and the ability\nto understand that concept is very,\n\n530\n00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.140\nvery important to the cloud professional.\n\n531\n00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.490\nIdentity, service and\n\n532\n00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.380\nidentity access management,\nhow are we gonna do access control?\n\n533\n00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.950\nHow are we gonna do identification\nof inbound requests for service?\n\n534\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.930\nRemember, with an access control\nthought process with IAM,\n\n535\n00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.610\nidentify access management, we identify,\nwe authenticate, then we authorize and\n\n536\n00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:13.290\nultimately we access, right?\n\n537\n00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.160\nSo we have to think about\nthe logic of that process flow.\n\n538\n00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.130\nIf we're not able to understand how to\nmanage identity, there's no way for\n\n539\n00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:22.300\nus to do access control effectively,\nso it becomes very important.\n\n540\n00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.430\nHow do we deal with\nmanagement of data sources?\n\n541\n00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.250\nSo storage management,\nalso management databases for\n\n542\n00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.650\nthe management plan, remember, gonna\nhave management infrastructure running.\n\n543\n00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.120\nWe have data that's aggregated and\ncollected for logging, for\n\n544\n00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.970\nconfiguration management, for\ncontinuous operations and\n\n545\n00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:40.440\nmonitoring, we have to control and\nmanage all that stuff as well.\n\n546\n00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.080\nGuest operating system protections and\n\n547\n00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.470\nvirtual machines themselves\nhave to be managed.\n\n548\n00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.350\nSo we've talked a lot about\nthe value of software definition and\n\n549\n00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.180\nautomation of configuration through\neither software defining or\n\n550\n00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:55.360\nsome sort of configuration management\nplatform with regards to virtual machines.\n\n551\n00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.960\nThe use of templates and cloning to\ndeploy VMs in an automated fashion.\n\n552\n00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:04.840\nThe use of scripting to automate\nthings like Puppet, or Chef, or Salt,\n\n553\n00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:08.690\nwhich are configuration, management,\nand automation platforms outside.\n\n554\n00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.350\nWhether they are vendor specific or\nvendor agnostic,\n\n555\n00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:12.820\nthey'll run on multiple platforms.\n\n556\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.997\nThe use of containerization to\nautomate deployment into a sense,\n\n557\n00:27:15.997 --> 00:27:19.741\nto create a modular deployment model\nthat's automated through scripting and\n\n558\n00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:20.818\npush button, right,\n\n559\n00:27:20.818 --> 00:27:24.460\nthat links into this framework\nconcept of dev ops is very big today.\n\n560\n00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:25.620\nWe know that server 16,\n\n561\n00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.410\nwhen it does finally arrive,\nwill support containerization.\n\n562\n00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:33.000\nThat's been one of the big announcements\nthat Microsoft has made over the last\n\n563\n00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.335\nyear or so as we're seeing\nthe development of that cycle.\n\n564\n00:27:35.335 --> 00:27:38.470\nAnd it's interesting, right, because\nthis is really impactful technology.\n\n565\n00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:42.084\nBeing able to use containerization on\na Windows platform to create cloud\n\n566\n00:27:42.084 --> 00:27:46.055\nenvironments and hosting environments is\ngonna be a huge step forward for us and\n\n567\n00:27:46.055 --> 00:27:50.145\nreally open up and change the way cloud\nsecurity professionals have to manage both\n\n568\n00:27:50.145 --> 00:27:52.175\nautomation and potentially risk.\n\n569\n00:27:52.175 --> 00:27:56.095\nBecause now, cloud security professionals\nare gonna have to get trained on this\n\n570\n00:27:56.095 --> 00:27:59.720\ntechnology and understand the impact of\nit, to understand the hosting models that\n\n571\n00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.720\non-prem private cloud may deploy over time\nbecause honestly, if you think about it,\n\n572\n00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:08.080\nthe majority of on-prem infrastructure\ntoday is Microsoft centric.\n\n573\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:12.880\nSo we would assume that the shift to\non-prem private cloud is gonna continue\n\n574\n00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.370\nover time, and when it does, it will\nmost likely wind up, not all of it,\n\n575\n00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.510\ncertainly, but a lot of it in\nMicrosoft's infrastructure base.\n\n576\n00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:21.250\nA lot of it is in VMware, a lot of it,\n\n577\n00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:24.100\nalthough not as much these days,\nis in Citrix, right.\n\n578\n00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.830\nSo the reality is,\nwe have to understand those platforms.\n\n579\n00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:30.764\nI'm not suggesting that a CCSP has to\nbecome a certified engineer on every\n\n580\n00:28:30.764 --> 00:28:33.120\nplatform to understand how to manage risk.\n\n581\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.630\nBut what I am suggesting is that we have\nto have operational knowledge of those\n\n582\n00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.410\nplatforms and their capabilities and the\nability to understand how to partner with\n\n583\n00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.596\npeople that are certified or\ndo have that in-depth knowledge in order\n\n584\n00:28:43.596 --> 00:28:46.910\nto understand how to talk security and\nmanage risk effectively.\n\n585\n00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.700\nRemember, automation,\nhopefully, if we do it well,\n\n586\n00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.930\nit takes the human out of the mix,\nwhich is very, very important for us.\n\n587\n00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.410\nWe have to very clearly demarcate and\nassign responsibilities\n\n588\n00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.950\nthrough delegation, and then manage\nthose individuals in those roles,\n\n589\n00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.740\nto ensure that they are doing\nthe things that we expect them to do,\n\n590\n00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.830\nboth with policy, with process,\nand with procedure.\n\n591\n00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.130\nSo we have to understand how to delegate\nand implement the proper layers and\n\n592\n00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.820\nseparation of duties and\ncontrols the defense in-depth requires.\n\n593\n00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.720\nWe keep coming back to this idea of\nresponsibility for both the customer and\n\n594\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.720\nthe provider.\n\n595\n00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.831\nAnd according to our service models, I ask\npass and sass, as we detailed out in many\n\n596\n00:29:21.831 --> 00:29:25.064\nof our episodes, you have to\nunderstand what the expectation for\n\n597\n00:29:25.064 --> 00:29:28.594\nresponsibility is, what infrastructure\nthe customer will control,\n\n598\n00:29:28.594 --> 00:29:31.630\nwhat infrastructure the provider\nwill be responsible for.\n\n599\n00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.000\nAnd we wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n600\n00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.510\nRemember, physical security will be\nthe responsibility of the provider\n\n601\n00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:41.200\nin every instance because\nthey own the infrastructure.\n\n602\n00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.790\nEven in I ask, they're providing it to us,\nbut it's in their data center.\n\n603\n00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.500\nSo we're really not gonna have the ability\nto do a physical security as a customer.\n\n604\n00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.480\nUnless we own the data center,\nwe're doing private on-prem cloud, right?\n\n605\n00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.060\nIt's really the only exception\nwe've identified there.\n\n606\n00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.930\nBut with everything else,\n\n607\n00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:58.160\nphysical security is pretty much\nthe purview of the cloud provider.\n\n608\n00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.980\nBut what about security, governance,\nrisk, and compliance-related activities?\n\n609\n00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.325\nGRC activities are really\ngonna be the purview of and\n\n610\n00:30:06.325 --> 00:30:09.593\nbe the focus of the customer\nacross all the models,\n\n611\n00:30:09.593 --> 00:30:14.762\neven though the provider's gonna have to\nattest to or certify that they are gonna\n\n612\n00:30:14.762 --> 00:30:19.760\nmeet certain stipulations or\nregulations from a compliant standpoint.\n\n613\n00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.554\nWe're gonna have to make sure\nwe do our due diligence and\n\n614\n00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:25.000\nexercise due care to\ncoordinate that activity.\n\n615\n00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.969\nAnd if we are in a SaaS model, for\ninstance, we have to make sure we contract\n\n616\n00:30:28.969 --> 00:30:32.245\nwith vendors that are gonna\nprovide the proper governance and\n\n617\n00:30:32.245 --> 00:30:34.765\noversight attestation,\nso we can validate for\n\n618\n00:30:34.765 --> 00:30:37.500\nour audit that we actually\nare implementing them.\n\n619\n00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.220\nWe have to manage our data a certain way.\n\n620\n00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:42.445\nWe have to create users and\ngive them access control in a certain way.\n\n621\n00:30:42.445 --> 00:30:46.950\nIn a IS model, we are gonna\nhave control over all of that,\n\n622\n00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.550\nbecause we are provisioning\nthe infrastructure from the ground up.\n\n623\n00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:53.987\nSo whatever operating systems we provide,\nwhatever app loads we run on top, whatever\n\n624\n00:30:53.987 --> 00:30:58.061\npolicies we use to govern, whatever\ninfrastructure management tools we use,\n\n625\n00:30:58.061 --> 00:31:02.011\nwhatever they may be, we have to provide\nthe guidance and the attestation and\n\n626\n00:31:02.011 --> 00:31:05.950\nthe compliance concerns and address\nthose with regards to the enterprise.\n\n627\n00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:10.412\nSo it really is a question of how we carve\nup these responsibilities, GRC activities,\n\n628\n00:31:10.412 --> 00:31:12.979\nwe should understand that,\nphysical security,\n\n629\n00:31:12.979 --> 00:31:15.230\nwhat about infrastructure security?\n\n630\n00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.330\nWhat about platform security, right?\n\n631\n00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:19.850\nWhat about application security,\nwhat about data security?\n\n632\n00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.380\nThese are all areas we would to have\nto think about and assign and ascribe\n\n633\n00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:28.670\nresponsibility to the customer, to the\ncloud provider, and in some cases, there's\n\n634\n00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.830\na window, kind of a gray area there,\nwhere we have shared responsibility.\n\n635\n00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.030\nBetween the two where it crosses over,\nso for instance, infrastructure security\n\n636\n00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.950\nin IS is both the provider and the\ncustomer's responsibility, it's shared.\n\n637\n00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.950\nWe've talked a lot about the fact that\nthe physical security is definitely\n\n638\n00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.590\nthe provider's responsibility\ncuz they own the data center.\n\n639\n00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.890\nBut the infrastructure that they own\nis essentially being carved off and\n\n640\n00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:53.590\nprovisioned to an individual tenant or\ncustomer.\n\n641\n00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.376\nSo the provider has the responsibility\nthere to get that part right.\n\n642\n00:31:56.376 --> 00:31:58.345\nBut then, [COUGH] excuse me, but then,\n\n643\n00:31:58.345 --> 00:32:01.508\nand they come up out of nowhere too,\nright, you're fine, and\n\n644\n00:32:01.508 --> 00:32:05.409\nthen all of a sudden, boom, you're\ncoughing up a lung on TV with no trouble.\n\n645\n00:32:05.409 --> 00:32:08.670\nSo I do apologize, I don't try to\ncough in your ears or anybody else's.\n\n646\n00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:09.941\nWhat I am talking typically.\n\n647\n00:32:09.941 --> 00:32:12.598\nBut we have a shared\ncrossover window here, right?\n\n648\n00:32:12.598 --> 00:32:15.146\nBecause with infrastructure security,\n\n649\n00:32:15.146 --> 00:32:19.727\nspecifically once they hand us the keys\nto our host with our CPUs, our RAM,\n\n650\n00:32:19.727 --> 00:32:24.560\nour network storage, it's us as\nthe customer that is provisioning that.\n\n651\n00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.190\nAnd now we have a shared\nresponsibility with the Cloud provider\n\n652\n00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:29.700\nto manage that infrastructure.\n\n653\n00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.840\nSo there is definitely crossover in\ncertain areas with platform security.\n\n654\n00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.310\nWith pass,\nwe would see a cross over in that area.\n\n655\n00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.920\nThe provider's gonna provision\nout the infrastructure and\n\n656\n00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.220\nthe initial operating system stack,\nbut we also bare responsibility for\n\n657\n00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.670\nthe platform,\nbecause we're gonna load our app and\n\n658\n00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:47.840\ndev environments on top of that and\nvirtualize and run on top.\n\n659\n00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.840\nAnd that's the customer's responsibility.\n\n660\n00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:51.820\nShared responsibility in that area.\n\n661\n00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.330\nWith regards to application security.\n\n662\n00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.410\nWe have crossover and\n\n663\n00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:58.860\nshared responsibility,\nin the SAS space, in this area.\n\n664\n00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.770\nBecause the provider, provides,\nall the infrastructure,\n\n665\n00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.840\nthe pass, and\nthe application API interfaces.\n\n666\n00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:09.060\nBut remember, we're loading our data,\nwe're creating our users in that space.\n\n667\n00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:13.000\nFrom an application security stand point,\nwe both share responsibility.\n\n668\n00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.220\nSo we have to understand where\nthe crossovers occur, but\n\n669\n00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.050\nalso where the clearly\ndemarcated areas are.\n\n670\n00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.410\nWe have to keep in mind that we\nhave to follow the data lifecycle,\n\n671\n00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:21.810\nthat we've often talked about.\n\n672\n00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.890\nData across all of the stages, right?\n\n673\n00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.080\nData at rest data in use data on the wire.\n\n674\n00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.520\nWe have to understand as we\noften will come back to and\n\n675\n00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.430\ntalk about the concerns there and\nmake sure we're moving through those.\n\n676\n00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:37.105\nWe have to think about\nvirtualization system controls.\n\n677\n00:33:37.105 --> 00:33:41.185\nHow we control for and obviously\nmanage not just the implementation of\n\n678\n00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:44.415\nthe hypervisor and the patching,\nsecurity patching, of it, but\n\n679\n00:33:44.415 --> 00:33:47.985\nultimately how we are going to\nvirtualize all the hardware components,\n\n680\n00:33:47.985 --> 00:33:52.275\nthe networking, the storage,\nthe compute resources, CPU and the RAM.\n\n681\n00:33:52.275 --> 00:33:55.645\nSpecifically with regards to networking\nand storage in particular, because this is\n\n682\n00:33:55.645 --> 00:34:00.120\nwhere we tend to get into problems for not\nusing secure protocols to access storage.\n\n683\n00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.060\nFor not using for\ninstance iSCSI with CHAP authentication,\n\n684\n00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.260\nwe are not doing storage\nas securely as we could be.\n\n685\n00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.759\nAnd as a result of that, we may actually\nallow authentication concerns to get in\n\n686\n00:34:11.759 --> 00:34:14.912\nthe way for our ability to\nmanage access to storage, and\n\n687\n00:34:14.912 --> 00:34:19.748\nif we don't manic those effectively, we\nmay allow unrestricted or unauthenticated\n\n688\n00:34:19.748 --> 00:34:24.180\nconnections which could allow a bad actor\nto connect to a data store and grab a VM\n\n689\n00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:28.850\nwith all its config and data files and\nwalk away with it for not being careful.\n\n690\n00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:31.900\nSo we have to think about that, we should\nbe thinking about using encryption\n\n691\n00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.640\non the data store to\nencrypt all the files.\n\n692\n00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.120\nBut then also secure protocols to\ntransmit data on the wire, and\n\n693\n00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:42.640\napplications that are encryption aware to\nuse that encryption to our benefit up and\n\n694\n00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.730\ndown the stack.\n\n695\n00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.230\nNetwork isolating or\nsecurity isolating our network traffic,\n\n696\n00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.300\nour management traffic, our storage\ntraffic, our VMotion, our live migration\n\n697\n00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.270\ntraffic, from other traffic by using\ndedicated virtual switching and\n\n698\n00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:59.600\ndedicated physical uplink infrastructure\nis also very important in the Cloud space.\n\n699\n00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.760\nWe really have to think about\nhow we're gonna do all this.\n\n700\n00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:06.800\nWe have to think about using to\ncreate failover awareness and\n\n701\n00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.480\nsurvivability on the physical\nnetwork structures.\n\n702\n00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.690\nSo that way if a network\ncard fails on the host,\n\n703\n00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.720\nwe're not isolating our virtual machines.\n\n704\n00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.010\nThat's a risk that we would have to\nbe aware of in the Cloud, because if\n\n705\n00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:20.930\nsomething as simple as a network failure\nwere to occur and isolate a running group\n\n706\n00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:24.850\nof VMs, we may actually lose service,\nlose continuity, lose availability,\n\n707\n00:35:24.850 --> 00:35:27.890\nand that would be of grave concern\nto the security professional.\n\n708\n00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.960\nSo we do have to think about\nall these things, right?\n\n709\n00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.860\nWe have to create trust zones for\nboth the physical and the logical\n\n710\n00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.150\ninfrastructure in other words, in the\nCloud, in the virtualized environments,\n\n711\n00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:40.070\nto be able to understand and ensure that\nwe are doing the things we need to do.\n\n712\n00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.110\nManagement of identification,\nauthentication authorization,\n\n713\n00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:45.950\nas I said, is very, very important, right?\n\n714\n00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.030\nWe have to understand that the service\nproviders are gonna be able to provide\n\n715\n00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.100\nthe infrastructure, but we're gonna\nhave to typically bring in identity and\n\n716\n00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.690\nor attribute providers to\nthen do the authentication\n\n717\n00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:57.200\non the identity management piece.\n\n718\n00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.810\nAnd the Cloud provider may\nin theory provide that.\n\n719\n00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:04.310\nSo for instance on the Azure platform,\nyou can host your LDAP directory there and\n\n720\n00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.110\nintegrate it right into the Cloud.\n\n721\n00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.180\nOr you can mirror essentially and\nsynchronize your on prem directory and\n\n722\n00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:12.770\nbecome you essentially can become\nin other words the customer,\n\n723\n00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.680\ncan become the identity attribute\nprovider that synchronizes or\n\n724\n00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.470\nmirrors their directory\nout to the Cloud provider.\n\n725\n00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.495\nSo there's different ways to do this.\n\n726\n00:36:19.495 --> 00:36:23.327\nAnd as a Cloud security professional,\nwe have to understand the do's and don't's\n\n727\n00:36:23.327 --> 00:36:27.115\nand practicality of walking through\nthese different models to understand\n\n728\n00:36:27.115 --> 00:36:31.405\nhow identification, how authentication,\nhow authorization will work in the Cloud.\n\n729\n00:36:31.405 --> 00:36:32.975\nVery, very important for us to consider.\n\n730\n00:36:34.295 --> 00:36:37.787\n>> Adam, security controls is something\nthat we have to take a close look at\n\n731\n00:36:37.787 --> 00:36:39.575\nbecause we've talking about what?\n\n732\n00:36:39.575 --> 00:36:43.550\nAbout the risks that inherent to any\nsystem, to be honest with you, but\n\n733\n00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:46.820\nit's here specifically Cloud,\nand how do we mitigate that?\n\n734\n00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.930\nWe do that through the security controls.\n\n735\n00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:51.850\nWe've looked at,\nwhere do we have to implement them, right?\n\n736\n00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:52.640\nOn the communications.\n\n737\n00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.910\nWe have to do it in virtualization,\n\n738\n00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.760\nwe have to do it any time that we're\naccessing systems and allowing for that.\n\n739\n00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.120\nWe have to make sure\nthere's something in place.\n\n740\n00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:06.305\nThat will help remove any malfeasance\nthat may be occurring under-\n\n741\n00:37:06.305 --> 00:37:07.940\n>> Malfeasance, I like that word,\n\n742\n00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.235\nthat's a good word, malfeasance.\n\n743\n00:37:09.235 --> 00:37:13.190\n>> [LAUGH] And it fits really well because\nthere are people out there that wanna\n\n744\n00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.790\ndo harm to systems for fun and profit,\nbe honest with you, for the most times.\n\n745\n00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.140\nAnd that's something we\nhave to look out for.\n\n746\n00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:24.440\nAdam we thank you for explaining a lot\nof the ways which we can do that.\n\n747\n00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.250\nBecause we have so\n\n748\n00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:29.430\nmany systems we have to take in account\nwhere we'll have to put in controls.\n\n749\n00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:33.560\nYou've kind of given us a guided\ntour of the many controls in which\n\n750\n00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:36.360\nwe can implement and design for\nin our environments.\n\n751\n00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.580\nThat being said, our clock has run out,\nso we are gonna go ahead and\n\n752\n00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.760\nclose this show down.\n\n753\n00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.990\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowry.\n\n754\n00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:45.865\n>> I have been your host Adam Gordon.\n\n755\n00:37:45.865 --> 00:37:47.350\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n756\n00:37:47.350 -->

another exciting\nepisode of ITPro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:17.840\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n5\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.460\nAnd in today's episode we\nare continuing on our certified clown\n\n6\n00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.380\nsecurity professional.\n\n7\n00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.910\nIf I can get that right.\n\n8\n00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.770\nAnd joining us today in the studio\nto help us out with that\n\n9\n00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.090\nvery endeavor is our good friend,\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.670\nAdam, welcome back to the show and\nhow's it going today?\n\n11\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.880\n>> Good.\nI keep waiting for you to say,\n\n12\n00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.900\ncertified ethical hacker.\n\n13\n00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.790\nI'm just waiting for that.\n\n14\n00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.330\n>> Yeah.\n>> To pop out at some point,\n\n15\n00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.070\nbecause I know that's\nwhat you're thinking.\n\n16\n00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.940\n>> So many certified somethings.\n\n17\n00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.500\n>> There is.\n\n18\n00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.030\nAbsolutely.\n\n19\n00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.530\nAbsolutely.\n\n20\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.420\nSo we're here to talk about certified\ncloud security professionals, right?\n\n21\n00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.890\nAnd so,\nwe're gonna continue our conversation\n\n22\n00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.480\nwith regards to data security\nin the infrastructure area.\n\n23\n00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350\nWe've been talking about\nin our prior session, or\n\n24\n00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.190\nprior episode,\nas we were going through all the risks and\n\n25\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.980\nthe risk management capabilities and\nconcerns we would have as a CCSP.\n\n26\n00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.610\nWe ended up at the very\nend of that conversation\n\n27\n00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.680\ntalking about directory related services,\nhow we can potentially\n\n28\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.530\nhost them in the cloud using\nsome sort of LDAP provisioning.\n\n29\n00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.690\nEither synchronization from our\non-prem out, or transfer that risk and\n\n30\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.520\nthat liability of hosting the directory\ndirectly to the cloud provider.\n\n31\n00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.390\nAnd putting our identification,\nauthentication, and\n\n32\n00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.030\nauthorization concerns and infrastructure\ninto the cloud through a hosted scenario.\n\n33\n00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.510\nWhether it's Microsoft fabric or\n\n34\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.690\ndirectory services though AWS or\nor whatever it may be.\n\n35\n00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.280\nSo we want to be thinking about that\nbecause the identity your attribute\n\n36\n00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.290\nprovider role and function has to either\nbe outsourced by us, the customer,\n\n37\n00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.060\nto the Cloud provider, or\nwe have to take that on and, essentially,\n\n38\n00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.590\npartner with the provider to synchronize\nand provide that information.\n\n39\n00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.840\nIt's very,\nvery important to us to figure that out.\n\n40\n00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.573\nFrom a risk management perspective, from\nthe security professional's perspective,\n\n41\n00:01:52.573 --> 00:01:55.473\nwe have to understand who controls\naccess to the directory service.\n\n42\n00:01:55.473 --> 00:01:59.531\nAnd the provider, because that's\ngonna indicate to us, ultimately,\n\n43\n00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:01.141\nWhere our focus from a policy and\n\n44\n00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:04.440\na management perspective needs\nto be with regards to risk.\n\n45\n00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.260\nIs it the purview, the ability of the\ncloud provider, to provide that service\n\n46\n00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.070\nand manage that risk that we have to\nwork on and control and document and\n\n47\n00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.600\ndictate through an SLA and a hosting\nagreement and manage as a result of that,\n\n48\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.250\nor do we as the security professional have\nto play a part in figuring out how we\n\n49\n00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.200\nIn the organization are gonna\nprovide that IT function.\n\n50\n00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.250\nAnd we're then gonna manage\nit with policy, with process,\n\n51\n00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.920\nwith procedure on our side.\n\n52\n00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.290\nAnd then we're simply gonna synchronize\nthat using whatever cloud APIs and\n\n53\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.865\nwhatever processes the cloud provider\nhas stipulated we should use.\n\n54\n00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:40.835\nSecure protocols to transform or\n\n55\n00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:45.885\nto transfer that information back and\nforth on this secure IP with this port.\n\n56\n00:02:45.885 --> 00:02:47.335\nYou know, whatever those things are.\n\n57\n00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:50.555\nWe'll pay attention to that, but\nwe're simply using the process the cloud\n\n58\n00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:54.215\nprovider is giving us to essentially\nupload or synchronize our data.\n\n59\n00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:58.300\nSo we have to understand that and\nreally ascribefFormally in\n\n60\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.220\na formal thought process as part of\nthe enterprise security architecture where\n\n61\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.960\ndirectory services will be managed because\nthey are very important to the cloud.\n\n62\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.180\nAnd the idea that identity and access\nmanagement is something that we really\n\n63\n00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.190\nhave to take on and focus on as a CCSP to\ntruly understand how to manage the risks\n\n64\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.660\nassociated with provisioning,\nbut specifically access control\n\n65\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.860\nin provisioning of\nresources within the cloud.\n\n66\n00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.030\nAnd remember,\nit may be a partnered endeavor.\n\n67\n00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.430\nIt may not very simply be, it's us\nmanaging, and we control everything.\n\n68\n00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.860\nAs a matter of fact, almost without\nexception, it will not be that.\n\n69\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.210\nAnd so we do have to think about that,\ntake that on, and\n\n70\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.660\nreally understand where we stand,\nwith that.\n\n71\n00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.850\nIdentification is important, we know,\n\n72\n00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.570\ndepending on the cloud environment\nit may take on one of several forms.\n\n73\n00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.520\nSo in a public cloud environment we may\nnot be asked to identify as a user at\n\n74\n00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.080\nall and if so\nreally just probably with a user name and\n\n75\n00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.270\npassword to be able to identify\nourselves if even that tight.\n\n76\n00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.950\nSo when we go out to any kind of publicly\naccessible website we are using a public\n\n77\n00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.690\ncloud to access that web but\nchances are good we probably are not\n\n78\n00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.640\ngoing to log in or at least not gonna\nauthenticate it a meaningful way.\n\n79\n00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.490\nBut we do need to understand that in\nhybrid environments we will be mixing\n\n80\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.390\nthe public and the private and we will be\nneeding to have an identity provider of\n\n81\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.900\nsome kind that will operate to ensure\nthe credentials that are provided or\n\n82\n00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.310\naccess and authentication claims that\nwill be made can be validated and\n\n83\n00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.900\nwe need to have some sort of\nsecurity infrastructure to do that.\n\n84\n00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.985\nWether it is going to be something like\nopen ID, or oath or oath 2.0, the.\n\n85\n00:04:27.985 --> 00:04:32.075\nThese days, SAML XAML,\nwhich are security assertion and\n\n86\n00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:34.675\nmarkup languages that are used.\n\n87\n00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:37.405\nWhatever those things will\nbe in standard protocols and\n\n88\n00:04:37.405 --> 00:04:42.125\nidentity frameworks, we have to,\nas cloud security providers, understand.\n\n89\n00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:47.245\nNot a CSP on the cloud service provider\nside, but as cloud security providers.\n\n90\n00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:51.605\nCloud certified security professionals\nessentially are cloud security providers.\n\n91\n00:04:51.605 --> 00:04:55.550\nWe provide that service and\nthat guidance to our customers.\n\n92\n00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.640\nWe have to think about how we're\ngoing to architect these solutions.\n\n93\n00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.900\nCorporate identity repositories on\nthe corporate side are used to manage LDAP\n\n94\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.970\ninfrastructure.\n\n95\n00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.480\nOn the Cloud provider side,\n\n96\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.780\nthrough public Clouds we don't have\nan LDAP provider necessarily, right?\n\n97\n00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.110\nBecause we're not creating a database for\nevery user that shows up.\n\n98\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.490\nBut we are securely authenticating users\nas they show up in a hybrid environment.\n\n99\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.460\nAnd it may not be with an LDAP\nenvironment, it may be something else.\n\n100\n00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.540\nSo we have to understand how to do that.\n\n101\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.000\nAnd the standards that we've been talking\nabout may be a good way to attack to that.\n\n102\n00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.540\nCan you do a quick web search for me while\nwe're talking can you go out to google and\n\n103\n00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.320\ncan you as if you would go\nanywhere else but Google right.\n\n104\n00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.850\nCan you go out to Google and\ncan you search for OAauth2.0 or\n\n105\n00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.690\nOAuth2 and you'll probably get one of\nthe Oasis sites or the sites for Oasis.\n\n106\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.370\nWhich is the body,\nthe standards body behind OAF.\n\n107\n00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.220\nAnd you will hopefully find a link\nthat we can just throw up quickly.\n\n108\n00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.920\n>> I see oaf.net and 2.0.\n\n109\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.030\nIs that?\n>> Let's try that.\n\n110\n00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.840\nLet's see what we get.\n\n111\n00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.110\nIs that not like one of the advertising\nlinks, but actual standards?\n\n112\n00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.990\n>> No, it's not.\n\n113\n00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.720\nIt's actually, yep.\n\n114\n00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.320\n>> Okay.\nAll right,\n\n115\n00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.690\nlet's if we could, are you ready?\n\n116\n00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.500\n>> Yes.\n>> Okay.\n\n117\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.510\nSo yeah, you'll see there is that the top?\n\n118\n00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.420\n>> That's the top of the page.\n\n119\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.240\n>> All right.\nSo if you go up you are rather,\n\n120\n00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.460\nzoom in a little bit,\nyou'll se the OAuth 2 standards are there.\n\n121\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.600\nLittle bit more, little bit more,\n\n122\n00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.900\nlittle bit more as I reach\nthrough the window to see.\n\n123\n00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.840\nAnd what we're seeing there\nis the OAuth 2.0 standard,\n\n124\n00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.070\nkind of the next generation\nof the OAuth protocol.\n\n125\n00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.640\nAnd they're giving us a little\nbit of information there,\n\n126\n00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.410\nI believe you can actually go out to the,\nthere's a mailing list\n\n127\n00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.630\nthere related topics there, you could read\nthe spec if you go down below I believe.\n\n128\n00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.120\nAnd see a link for that which will\ntake you out there to the ITF and\n\n129\n00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.930\nyou could find the VRC so you can look for\ninformation if you wanted to.\n\n130\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.590\nThis is just one example of one of\nthe security protocols that is being\n\n131\n00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.488\nused right now.\n\n132\n00:06:51.488 --> 00:06:56.830\nI mentioned producer of markup language,\nopen ID which\n\n133\n00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.685\nis an ID framework that is being used\nwith PCID assess compliance systems and\n\n134\n00:07:02.685 --> 00:07:06.745\nsystems that do EDI electronic data\ninterchange, to be able to manage data.\n\n135\n00:07:06.745 --> 00:07:10.965\nSo we see a lot of these different things\nout there and we can interact with and\n\n136\n00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:13.345\nshould be familiar with these concerns or\n\n137\n00:07:13.345 --> 00:07:16.615\nat least be aware of the concerns\nassociated with these standards and\n\n138\n00:07:16.615 --> 00:07:21.045\nas a CCSP we wanna read up on this and\nmake sure we are comfortable with it.\n\n139\n00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:24.710\nCan you also quickly while\nwe're here do a search for?\n\n140\n00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.200\nSAML security association markup language.\n\n141\n00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.020\nAnd we don't wanna go to like the Wiki\nwe wanna actually go to probably\n\n142\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.905\nif we see it down there we may see a,\nI'm not able to see as clearly as you are.\n\n143\n00:07:39.905 --> 00:07:40.740\n>> Saml.xml.org.\n\n144\n00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.370\n>> Yeah try that one that's\nthe one we want right there.\n\n145\n00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.646\nAnd so SAML XML dot org, you'll see\nthe Oasis logo off to the right.\n\n146\n00:07:47.646 --> 00:07:51.465\nOasis is the group behind the scene, so\nit's kind of managing a lot of these\n\n147\n00:07:51.465 --> 00:07:55.119\nstandards and the thought process and\nthe working groups around them.\n\n148\n00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:57.880\nAnd so we can read up on and\nget information on SAML, and\n\n149\n00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.760\nthe use of SAML the security\nassertion mark up language,\n\n150\n00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.221\nwith regards to claims\nbased authentication and\n\n151\n00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:07.360\nthings of that nature and attributes,\nand the kind of things we may do there.\n\n152\n00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.060\nSo you can easily go out as a CCSP do\na little googling on your own, and\n\n153\n00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.110\nfind this information.\n\n154\n00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.350\nIt wouldn't be too hard for\nyou to do that.\n\n155\n00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.730\nWe'd wanna be focused on authentication.\n\n156\n00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:23.250\nWe'd wanna be focused on the ability\nto understand identity providers and\n\n157\n00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.420\nattributes in those kind of things would\nall be important for us to be considerate.\n\n158\n00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.060\nWhere is the stuff coming from?\n\n159\n00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.050\nUnder what guides is it being offered?\n\n160\n00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.650\nUnder what conditions we\nare validating identity.\n\n161\n00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.860\nWho are we, what are we, and\n\n162\n00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.470\nwhere are we are the things we\noften want to try to figure out.\n\n163\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.750\nAnd so authentication,\nidentification, authorization,\n\n164\n00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.230\nthose are all important thought\nprocesses for the CCSP to understand.\n\n165\n00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.220\nWhen we talk about IAM, Identity and\n\n166\n00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.280\nAccess Management we\nfocus on identity first.\n\n167\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.190\nWhat is the identity of the individual,\nthe subject, whether it’s a user,\n\n168\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.510\na service, an application\nproxy on behalf of the user?\n\n169\n00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.040\nWhat is the identification\nthat they are offering,\n\n170\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.570\nwhat identity claims are being\nmade in other words.\n\n171\n00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.540\nWe wanna understand that.\n\n172\n00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.020\nIt could be a user name and a password,\nit could be a token of some kind,\n\n173\n00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.150\nit could be a challenge response\nmechanism, it could be a smart card.\n\n174\n00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.960\nCould be a digital certificate.\n\n175\n00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.790\nCould be any number of things\nthat are being offered.\n\n176\n00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:17.800\nCould be a biometric scan.\n\n177\n00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.590\nAny number of things that are being\noffered to proffer identify.\n\n178\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.930\nYou have to take those and\nthen we have to authenticate that claim or\n\n179\n00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.200\nthat series of claims, right?\n\n180\n00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.660\nSo if Daniel says to me, hey, I wanna\nlog into your system, Adam, securely.\n\n181\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.340\nI need a user account to do that and\nyou need to validate my identify.\n\n182\n00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.140\nI'll provide a user account to Daniel, so\nI'll create a user account called, Danel1,\n\n183\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.290\nor whatever it is.\n\n184\n00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.180\nAnd I'll give Daniel that information.\n\n185\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.140\nI'll do so securely, so\nnobody's able to understand what it is,\n\n186\n00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.140\nso, all of you out there, don't pay\nattention to what I'm about to say.\n\n187\n00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.851\nSo, I'll do it this way so nobody can see.\n\n188\n00:09:48.851 --> 00:09:51.324\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So username, is DanielLPassword,\n\n189\n00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:52.149\nis password1.\n\n190\n00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:54.691\nSo then see,\nI'm transferring that securely.\n\n191\n00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.690\nThat's what we call an out\nof band transmission.\n\n192\n00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:58.730\nBecause you can't see it.\n\n193\n00:09:58.730 --> 00:09:59.880\n>> They could be muted.\n\n194\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.940\n>> It could be muted.\n\n195\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.730\nBut you would hear it.\n\n196\n00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:03.200\nRight?\nAnd so, obviously, clearly,\n\n197\n00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.620\nright, it's not secure.\n\n198\n00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.220\nWe would never do something like that.\n\n199\n00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.290\nBut when we think about managing risk, how\nwould you securely extend that credential?\n\n200\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.302\nOver to Daniel without knocking\nhis computer off the dais here.\n\n201\n00:10:14.302 --> 00:10:17.720\nHow would you actually extend that\ncredential out and give it to Daniel, or\n\n202\n00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.940\nany user, without violating, right,\nthe confidentiality of that information?\n\n203\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:23.910\nYou wouldn't give it out\nverbally the way I just did,\n\n204\n00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.850\nclearly, cuz somebody may be listening.\n\n205\n00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.160\nMaybe I'll write it down.\n\n206\n00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.350\nBut if I hand it to Daniel on a piece\nof paper and somebody's watching.\n\n207\n00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.190\nMaybe they can see it.\n\n208\n00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.430\nSo I have to come up with a way to\nsecurely transmit that information, right?\n\n209\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.090\nThat's one of the risks we'd\nhave to overcome and figure out.\n\n210\n00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:38.760\nSo we may use a central data repository.\n\n211\n00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.260\nInventory where that\ninformation can be put.\n\n212\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.310\nDaniel can be given that information\nthrough some sort of out of band\n\n213\n00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:48.490\ncommunication mechanism, right, so\nthat it's not obvious to the bad actor.\n\n214\n00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:51.870\nWe then invite Daniel to log in and\nto validate that credential.\n\n215\n00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.200\nWe would have to authenticate his\nprovisioning of that credential,\n\n216\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.010\nhis providing of it into the system.\n\n217\n00:10:57.010 --> 00:11:00.090\nSo he would log in,\nhe would go to the form.\n\n218\n00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:02.830\nHe'd provide his username,\nhis password, or whatever it is.\n\n219\n00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:07.490\nAnd then we would establish with adequate\ncertainty the identity of that entity,\n\n220\n00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.880\nin this case the identity of Daniel.\n\n221\n00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:14.560\nThis function authentication is\na function of the identity provider,\n\n222\n00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.700\nwe do need to understand that.\n\n223\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.340\nIn other words,\nI would be doing the authentication\n\n224\n00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.700\nbecause as the identity provider, I am the\nonly one in a position to know whether or\n\n225\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.540\nnot Daniel's credential is valid.\n\n226\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.260\nSo we do.\n\n227\n00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.100\nCCSPs need to unequivocally,\nclearly understand, which equals, hey,\n\n228\n00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.550\nmake sure you pay attention to this\ncuz it's important to know, right?\n\n229\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:37.910\nWe need to know that authentication's\na function of the identity provider.\n\n230\n00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:38.970\nWe then authorize.\n\n231\n00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.150\nSo the identity provider is going to\nauthenticate Daniel's credential.\n\n232\n00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.100\nI'll look Daniel up and say,\nyes Daniel is an authorized user.\n\n233\n00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.870\nHopefully Daniel's an authorized user.\n\n234\n00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:51.890\nIf not we'll never get to we'll\nnever authenticate data and if so\n\n235\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.480\nwe'll never allow him to be authorized but\nassuming Daniel should be an authorized\n\n236\n00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.880\nuser I'll look him up I'll authenticate\nhim and then I'm gonna authorize him.\n\n237\n00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.350\nI'm gonna essentially assign\npermissions rights and\n\n238\n00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.530\ncapabilities to his account,\nhis user proxy whatever that is and\n\n239\n00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.200\nI'm gonna give that account the right for\nDaniel to do certain things.\n\n240\n00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.400\nMaybe he could go ahead and\nhe can Access files on a share.\n\n241\n00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.060\nMaybe he can interact with an application.\n\n242\n00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.640\nMaybe he can open up a web browser and\nconnect to an internal secure site.\n\n243\n00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.820\nWhatever it is,\nhe's going to have rights to do that.\n\n244\n00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.235\nAuthorization, the process\nof granting access.\n\n245\n00:12:25.235 --> 00:12:28.775\nTo resources based on identities and\nattributes of identities,\n\n246\n00:12:28.775 --> 00:12:32.525\nsuch as role or any kind of\ncontextual information provided,\n\n247\n00:12:32.525 --> 00:12:36.685\nis also going to be part of the identity\nprovider's responsibilities,\n\n248\n00:12:36.685 --> 00:12:39.435\nbecause the identity provider\nis in the position to\n\n249\n00:12:39.435 --> 00:12:43.625\nunderstand the authentication outcome,\nand therefore to drive authorization.\n\n250\n00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.530\nIdentity and access management is\nreally this process that we engage in\n\n251\n00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.400\nto validate users as they show up,\n\n252\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.210\nand essentially make claims on\nour ability to provide services.\n\n253\n00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:58.050\nAnd do decide whether or\nnot those claims are valid.\n\n254\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.230\nIf the claims are valid,\nwe should allow them in.\n\n255\n00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.520\nIf the claims are not,\nwe should deny them.\n\n256\n00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.960\nSo access decisions have to be made.\n\n257\n00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.920\nRight, can the device be allowed to\naccess the network from a remote position\n\n258\n00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.120\noutside, perhaps, perhaps not,\nare they coming in on a valid IP address?\n\n259\n00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.640\nAre they coming in on a valid operating\nsystem with a valid VPN tunnel?\n\n260\n00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.870\nOr are they using an insecure\ncommunication mechanism?\n\n261\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.630\nNo encryption, no tunnel.\n\n262\n00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.010\nUnrecognized IP Address.\n\n263\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.570\nThe MAC address is not registered.\n\n264\n00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:29.790\nThe protection profile,\nthe baseline on the system, is incorrect.\n\n265\n00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.760\nThey're running Windows Vista and\nthey should be running Windows 10 or\n\n266\n00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.120\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n267\n00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.130\nWe can stand for and indeed do and\n\n268\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:40.060\noften times we'd mange these\nsystems as they connect these ways.\n\n269\n00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.870\nSo we may talk about this\nis network access control,\n\n270\n00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.110\nas network access protection,\ndifferent vendors will essentially brand\n\n271\n00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.249\nthis technology using different names but\nultimately.\n\n272\n00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.540\nWe want to be thinking about the kind of\nthings that we would want to control for.\n\n273\n00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.520\nWe're gonna have an interesting\nlittle demo we're gonna do for\n\n274\n00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.650\nyou here in just a moment.\n\n275\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.880\nWe're gonna put up an access\ncontrol matrix and\n\n276\n00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.590\nactually walk you through the process\nof seeing how this comes to life.\n\n277\n00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:06.140\nAnd Daniel Daniel figured out along\nthe way how to actually use Word in\n\n278\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.590\nthe Mac platform, so\nit's been a win win for everybody.\n\n279\n00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.390\nHe's got some new skills,\nhe's very proud of himself.\n\n280\n00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.340\n>> It's a learning experience.\n\n281\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.100\n>> It is a learning experience.\n\n282\n00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.640\nHere at IT Pro TV, we're big on learning.\n\n283\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.328\n>> That's right.\n>> Everybody learns all the time.\n\n284\n00:14:15.328 --> 00:14:19.780\nSo he learned how to use Word and create\na table, so we're very, very proud of him.\n\n285\n00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.300\n>> Thank you, thank you.\n\n286\n00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:20.840\n>> Gold star.\nAnd\n\n287\n00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.320\nwe're gonna show you [LAUGH] the output\nof that work in just a second.\n\n288\n00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.700\nNot yet, but\nwe will show you that in just a second.\n\n289\n00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:29.230\nBut think about the kinds of access\ndecision points we engage in.\n\n290\n00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.030\nAnd if we find as security\nprofessionals all the time.\n\n291\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.670\nUsers are always knocking on\nthe proverbial door, right,\n\n292\n00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.010\nthe front end of the cloud.\n\n293\n00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:36.750\nI want to get in.\n\n294\n00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:38.010\nI want to consume data.\n\n295\n00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.060\nI want to connect remotely.\n\n296\n00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.315\nI want to be able to pull that data\ndown and use it on this platform.\n\n297\n00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:43.055\nForm.\nAre we or\n\n298\n00:14:43.055 --> 00:14:45.625\nare we not going to allow them to do that,\nis really the question.\n\n299\n00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:47.355\nAnd we have to think about that, right.\n\n300\n00:14:47.355 --> 00:14:48.875\nAnd think long and hard, by the way.\n\n301\n00:14:48.875 --> 00:14:51.825\nBecause if we allow them to do that\nwithout really understanding, and\n\n302\n00:14:51.825 --> 00:14:55.935\nreally seeing the potential benefit,\nbut also the potential concern,\n\n303\n00:14:55.935 --> 00:14:57.235\nthe liability of the risk.\n\n304\n00:14:57.235 --> 00:15:00.365\nSo stated with that decision, if we\nmake the wrong decision, in other words,\n\n305\n00:15:00.365 --> 00:15:03.465\nif we choose poorly,\nwe may actually have propagated,\n\n306\n00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:06.790\nallowed a risk to, move forward in\nthe system that could've been prevented.\n\n307\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.560\nIf we had only made a better decision.\n\n308\n00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.870\nSo again,\n\n309\n00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:14.210\ncome back to this idea of planning to\nbe successful versus planning to fail.\n\n310\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.820\nSo if we can go to Daniel's desktop.\n\n311\n00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.735\nDo you have the?\nThe table up?\n\n312\n00:15:16.735 --> 00:15:17.250\n>> Um-hm.\n>> All right.\n\n313\n00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.620\nSo here we are.\nWe should be good.\n\n314\n00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.990\nSo let's take a look at how we're\ngonna actually go through, and\n\n315\n00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.890\npotentially represent, and ultimately\nderive an access control matrix.\n\n316\n00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:30.379\nThe idea here is that we want to be\nable to understand visually layout.\n\n317\n00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:35.209\nWhat the claims and or attributes will be\nthat we may use ultimately to figure out\n\n318\n00:15:35.209 --> 00:15:39.388\nwho or what will drive the axis control\ndecision for our user and or for\n\n319\n00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:44.075\nthe equipment that user is going to use\nto represent the kinds of concerns that\n\n320\n00:15:44.075 --> 00:15:47.969\nwe as cloud security professionals\nWhat I have to wrestle with,\n\n321\n00:15:47.969 --> 00:15:51.358\nwhen we think about whether\nwe should let somebody in and\n\n322\n00:15:51.358 --> 00:15:56.460\ngive them access to resources and if so,\nmost importantly under what conditions.\n\n323\n00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.260\nRight, this is really going to be\nultimately what we gotta figure out.\n\n324\n00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.270\nSo what we're going to\ndo is take a look here.\n\n325\n00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.650\nDaniel was kind enough to make\nup a fancy table for us here.\n\n326\n00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:08.800\nAnd so we're gonna go ahead and we're\ngonna actually use this to illustrate,\n\n327\n00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.720\nto walk through the concepts that we\nwould want to make sure we're clear on.\n\n328\n00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.180\nNow keep in mind as we do this, and\n\n329\n00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:17.360\nwe'll explain what's up there that\nyou're looking at in just a second.\n\n330\n00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.100\nBut keep in mind that although we would\nsometimes actually do this for real,\n\n331\n00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.050\nyou would sit down and sketch this out,\n\n332\n00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:27.530\nand you'll quickly do this thought process\nto understand or represent this for\n\n333\n00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.435\nyou, as the cloud professional,\nis looking to figure out access control.\n\n334\n00:16:31.435 --> 00:16:34.115\nThe reality is we don't tend to\nmake these matrixes all that often.\n\n335\n00:16:34.115 --> 00:16:37.115\nAnd they're very long, they're very\ninvolved, there could be hundreds,\n\n336\n00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:38.605\nthousands potentially,\n\n337\n00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:41.975\nof different permutations whom we may\nhave to address and be concerned with.\n\n338\n00:16:41.975 --> 00:16:44.125\nAnd we have software that does this for\nus, right.\n\n339\n00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:48.580\nThe reality is today,\nany access control package and\n\n340\n00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.850\nthe LDAP interface that you use to manage,\nis going to render this for\n\n341\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:58.340\nyou in a results oriented format where\nyou can see what the effective, we often\n\n342\n00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.640\ncall it effective permission or effective\naccess, is going to be for the user.\n\n343\n00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.010\nSo you may not actually\ngo through this exercise.\n\n344\n00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:07.930\nBut it is good to understand\nthe concept in order to figure\n\n345\n00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.130\nout how to apply the knowledge and make\nsure you have a sense of how this works.\n\n346\n00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:15.520\nSo having said that, on the left we see\nthe column that says Claims or Attributes.\n\n347\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.400\nAnd then we go left to right.\n\n348\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.480\nWe're gonna see Manager Access or\nManager's Access.\n\n349\n00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.030\nSo the user manager or\n\n350\n00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:26.910\na user that is a member of the managers\ngroup would be represented here.\n\n351\n00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.250\nThird column over,\nwe're gonna have Users Access.\n\n352\n00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.370\nAgain, this would be an individual user,\n\n353\n00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:36.430\nprobably a standard information worker of\nsome kind, right, in the organization.\n\n354\n00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.020\nAnd then to the right of that we\nhave a user called again Manager,\n\n355\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.820\nwho's gonna be remote.\n\n356\n00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.690\nWho's gonna essentially access the system\nfrom outside the organizational\n\n357\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:48.420\nboundaries somewhere,\nusing a corporate owned device.\n\n358\n00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.780\nWe have that in parenthesis up there for\nimporting to stipulate that.\n\n359\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.600\nThat'll cross reference with\nour attributes further down\n\n360\n00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.360\non the left-hand side, and we'll talk\nabout that relationship in just a moment.\n\n361\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.670\nAppreciate you jumping in there and\nhighlighting that for me, good sir.\n\n362\n00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.190\nAnd then off to the right\nin the fifth column over,\n\n363\n00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.730\nremote user access from\na home base device.\n\n364\n00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:10.240\nA device that is not going to\nbe controlled or known to us.\n\n365\n00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.450\nAnd this is gonna be an average\nuser attempting to remote in.\n\n366\n00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:17.481\nSo now that we've laid out the thought\nprocess, what we're gonna see is we're\n\n367\n00:18:17.481 --> 00:18:21.512\ngonna go back over to claims attributes\ncolumn on the left, and we're gonna see\n\n368\n00:18:21.512 --> 00:18:24.973\nour first two areas or items\nunderneath there are gonna be ID based.\n\n369\n00:18:24.973 --> 00:18:29.106\nWe have a user ID and\nthen we have a Device ID of some kind, and\n\n370\n00:18:29.106 --> 00:18:32.497\nas we trail over left to\nright looking at the row,\n\n371\n00:18:32.497 --> 00:18:35.921\nso we're going to simply\nmove across the table.\n\n372\n00:18:35.921 --> 00:18:41.065\nWe will see that we have a Y specified for\nevery block which\n\n373\n00:18:41.065 --> 00:18:47.080\nmeans that the User ID is present for\nevery one of those four areas.\n\n374\n00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.550\nWe have a manager who has a user ID\nuniquely identifying them as an authorized\n\n375\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.570\nuser within the directory.\n\n376\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.480\nWe have a user, whatever that user is,\nJohn Doe, Jane Smith,\n\n377\n00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.740\nthey're going to be authorized.\n\n378\n00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.360\nThey're gonna have a User ID, and\n\n379\n00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:04.360\nthen when that remote manager is\ngonna use that User ID to access and\n\n380\n00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.600\nvalidate from outside the corporate lam,\nthey present that so we have that present.\n\n381\n00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.850\nAnd when the remote user from home is\nusing that as well we also have a User ID.\n\n382\n00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.330\nSo User ID is present in every\none of the transactions.\n\n383\n00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:17.060\nAs a result,\n\n384\n00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.860\nwe are essentially using an authorized\nuser or examining an authorized user.\n\n385\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.640\nWe'll move down to device id.\n\n386\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.740\nWe see that we have a device id\npresent for three of the four areas.\n\n387\n00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.960\nThe fourth one at the extreme\nright hand corner of the table\n\n388\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:34.210\nis the remote user accessing\nfrom home with their own device.\n\n389\n00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.890\nThat is specified as an N,\n\n390\n00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:39.270\nspecifically unknown because we\ndon't have knowledge of that device.\n\n391\n00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:40.380\nIt's not managed.\n\n392\n00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.680\nWe don't have any way of controlling it.\n\n393\n00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.577\nWe don't know what's on it.\nCould be Macintosh, for instance, right?\n\n394\n00:19:44.577 --> 00:19:45.480\n>> Um-hm.\n\n395\n00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.770\n>> And we may not understand that or\nmanage that device platform.\n\n396\n00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.870\nMaybe it is a Windows machine, but\n\n397\n00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.880\nit's a Windows machine running\nWindows Vista or Windows XP.\n\n398\n00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.320\nAnd that's not up to the corporate\nbaseline or standard for the desktop maybe\n\n399\n00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.820\nrunning Windows Eight or Windows Ten,\nor, whatever that would be, and so\n\n400\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.180\nwe don't really understand that machine,\nand as a result we will put a no there.\n\n401\n00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.820\nSo it's not known to us.\n\n402\n00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.260\nWe move down and\nthen we see two attributes listed, and\n\n403\n00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.230\nthe first of the two attributes will be,\nUser is Manager.\n\n404\n00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.320\nIn other words, we have to specify whether\nthe user is a member of the manager's\n\n405\n00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.620\ngroup, or is a other group of some kind,\nin this case average user user, right?\n\n406\n00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:27.230\nSo we see Y for manager access, and\nwe see Y also under the remote manager\n\n407\n00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.890\naccess column, specifying that when\nthe user is a manager either in the lan or\n\n408\n00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.390\nremotely, we have identified them\nwith an attribute that says yes,\n\n409\n00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:37.360\nyou're a member of the manager's group.\n\n410\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.582\nWhen they are not, we see an N under\nuser access signifying that they are not\n\n411\n00:20:41.582 --> 00:20:43.538\na member of the manager's group.\n\n412\n00:20:43.538 --> 00:20:47.055\nAnd then the last attribute down will\nbe device is on corporate network.\n\n413\n00:20:47.055 --> 00:20:50.691\nAnd so again we're going to read\nthrough there and see the logic,\n\n414\n00:20:50.691 --> 00:20:54.987\nwe have Y under the manager access,\nbecause when the manager uses the network\n\n415\n00:20:54.987 --> 00:20:58.489\non the corporate LAN it is a member\nof the corporate network, or\n\n416\n00:20:58.489 --> 00:21:02.785\nis joined at the corporate network or\ndomain when the user uses their computer\n\n417\n00:21:02.785 --> 00:21:06.851\non the corporate LAN or the office it\nis a member of the corporate domain.\n\n418\n00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:10.462\nAnd then we will see that we have N for\nthe last two columns,\n\n419\n00:21:10.462 --> 00:21:15.334\nbecause even though the remote manager\naccessing the system using a corporate\n\n420\n00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:17.989\ndevice is a profile we want to understand,\n\n421\n00:21:17.989 --> 00:21:22.967\nthe device itself is not on the corporate\nnetwork when we originate the access.\n\n422\n00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:27.902\nIt is outside, remotely different IP\naddress, probably require a VPN most\n\n423\n00:21:27.902 --> 00:21:32.759\nlikely to come in and will not be using\na internal access IP but rather coming\n\n424\n00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:37.730\nin from outside with a different\nprofile so we wanna signify that.\n\n425\n00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.605\nAnd again, you know,\nif you think about the logic of this,\n\n426\n00:21:40.605 --> 00:21:44.300\nwe could create a whole bunch of these\nclaims or attributes in theory right?\n\n427\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.482\nWe could have all sorts of stuff there.\n\n428\n00:21:46.482 --> 00:21:49.951\nWe've only chosen three or four just for\npurposes or representation here, and\n\n429\n00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:53.538\nalso cause the screen size, if we had too\nmany, wouldn't be able to see them all.\n\n430\n00:21:53.538 --> 00:21:58.137\nBut the reality is, you know, in the real\nworld as you do this you may have 20, 30,\n\n431\n00:21:58.137 --> 00:22:02.295\n40 specific attributes and ID claims that\nyou have to contend with In order to\n\n432\n00:22:02.295 --> 00:22:07.100\nvalidate the user, we could be, in other\nwords, look for granular as my point here.\n\n433\n00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:09.798\nWe're being fairly high level,\nfairly simplistic,\n\n434\n00:22:09.798 --> 00:22:11.625\nfairly basic with our assumptions.\n\n435\n00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:15.681\nBut we, in a real world scenario,\nin a private on prim cloud,\n\n436\n00:22:15.681 --> 00:22:20.283\ncould be highly granular, in a off\nprim cloud of some kind its host with\n\n437\n00:22:20.283 --> 00:22:24.496\na third party, the Amazon AWS,\nthe Azure fabric on Microsoft,\n\n438\n00:22:24.496 --> 00:22:28.865\nas we've often talked about,\ncould provide additional claims,\n\n439\n00:22:28.865 --> 00:22:32.559\nattributes, and\ndetails we would wanna wrestle with.\n\n440\n00:22:32.559 --> 00:22:34.539\nAnd we'd have to think through that, and\n\n441\n00:22:34.539 --> 00:22:38.150\nobviously then work through the logic\nof what those would look like.\n\n442\n00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:40.320\nWe then distill down on the bottom row,\n\n443\n00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.830\nwhich is actually left blank\non this particular A table.\n\n444\n00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:47.470\nDaniel is gonna help me put some stuff\nin there and create some magic for us.\n\n445\n00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.500\nWe are gonna distill down and essentially\ncreate what the access results will be.\n\n446\n00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.090\nSo Daniel,\n\n447\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.580\nlet's kind of walk through this with\nthe people out in the studio audience.\n\n448\n00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:59.750\nSo if we have a whole bunch of yeses,\nin this case under manager access, right?\n\n449\n00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:02.960\nEverything essentially has\nbeen set to yes or positive.\n\n450\n00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.190\nWe validated that.\n\n451\n00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.050\nWhat do you think the access\nresults should be for\n\n452\n00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.450\nsomebody like that in that condition?\n\n453\n00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.760\nWhat would we put there in other words?\n\n454\n00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:12.650\n>> Yeah, I assume that they would have\nlike full control, or full access.\n\n455\n00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.110\n>> So full control, or full access, right?\n\n456\n00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.220\nSo that sounds pretty usable, right?\n\n457\n00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.350\nGiven at what we're looking at.\n\n458\n00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:19.880\nSo we'll type in Full Control or\nFull Access, or\n\n459\n00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.900\nwhatever it may be and we will signify,\n\n460\n00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.210\nessentially by doing that, that we assume\nthat under the conditions specified,\n\n461\n00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:30.950\nas long as a member of the manager's\ngroup is able to put a Y in all those\n\n462\n00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.790\ncolumns as they meet the profile that we\nshould grant them that level of control.\n\n463\n00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.500\nRight?\n\n464\n00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.990\nAll right, so if we move over to\nuser access we don't have all Y's.\n\n465\n00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:41.813\nWe have some Ys, but\nthere's at least one no sitting there, so\n\n466\n00:23:41.813 --> 00:23:44.976\nwe have to also have to think about\nwhat that cumulative effect may be.\n\n467\n00:23:44.976 --> 00:23:45.565\nRight?\n\n468\n00:23:45.565 --> 00:23:48.513\nSo if we're going to give\nthem some level of access,\n\n469\n00:23:48.513 --> 00:23:50.599\nwould we the question then becomes.\n\n470\n00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:55.048\nWould we as the CCSP want to grant them\nthe same level of access as the manager?\n\n471\n00:23:55.048 --> 00:23:57.220\nWould we give them full control?\n\n472\n00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.290\nWould we give them less?\n\n473\n00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.080\nWould we give them no access?\n\n474\n00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:01.620\nThere's a lot of options, right?\n\n475\n00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:03.130\nSo, what are we feeling like today?\n\n476\n00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.160\nAre we feeling generous?\n\n477\n00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.080\nOr are we feeling like maybe a user's\npissed us off at some point and\n\n478\n00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.324\nwe wanna pay them back and exile them?\n\n479\n00:24:10.324 --> 00:24:11.150\nWhat do you think we should do?\n\n480\n00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.923\n>> I would say because of\nthe matrix that we're looking at,\n\n481\n00:24:13.923 --> 00:24:15.830\nand we would give them\njust standard access,\n\n482\n00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.050\nobviously not manager level access\nbecause well, they're not managers.\n\n483\n00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:23.120\nBut they're on our LAN, they're using\nour device, or what do we have here.\n\n484\n00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.700\nThey're not a manager, they're on\na device is on a corporate network.\n\n485\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.070\nAnd they are using their\nown device on our LAN.\n\n486\n00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:34.880\n>> No, they're using the corporate\ndevice on our LAN with a valid user ID.\n\n487\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.620\n>> Yeah, so\nI would say just standard access.\n\n488\n00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:40.600\n>> Okay, so we would go ahead and\nwe would put in standard access there.\n\n489\n00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.860\nSo Daniel will type that in for us.\n\n490\n00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.460\nAnd we'll see standard control,\nstandard access.\n\n491\n00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:46.940\nWe have a sense what that means, right?\n\n492\n00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.100\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, so we got that.\n\n493\n00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.460\nYou can see the idea here, right.\n\n494\n00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:52.830\nWe're kind of going down,\nand although Daniel and\n\n495\n00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.510\nI are having a conversation about this,\nthe reality is we wouldn't actually have\n\n496\n00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.380\nthis conversation,\nwe would just figure out what's going on.\n\n497\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.780\nBut this is the thought process.\n\n498\n00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.470\nThis is kind of the unspoken process\nas the gears are turning, right?\n\n499\n00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.700\nAnd we're thinking through\nthe logic of this.\n\n500\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.100\nNow remember, this is gonna be automated\ntraditionally in most systems,\n\n501\n00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.860\nso you wouldn't even sit down and have\nthis conversation or actually do this.\n\n502\n00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.640\nThere would be a process that\nkicks off on the back end.\n\n503\n00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.610\nYou drop users into certain groups.\n\n504\n00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.100\nYou have certain attributes\nassociated with them.\n\n505\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.160\nThey essentially match\na certain profile for access.\n\n506\n00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.880\nAnd they're granted a level of\naccess based on that match.\n\n507\n00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.980\nSo it's a very simplistic process in\nthe sense we're doing a pattern match.\n\n508\n00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.750\nAnd based on the rendering of the pattern,\n\n509\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.890\nwe have a certain preconceived\naccess level we're gonna grant.\n\n510\n00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:36.940\nWe're just bringing that to life for\nyou but\n\n511\n00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.120\nwalking you through it really to make\nsure you have a sense of what this looks\n\n512\n00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.502\nlike as a CCSP and having you understand\nhow to apply this thought process.\n\n513\n00:25:44.502 --> 00:25:47.832\nAll right, so the third one over,\nremote manager accessing from home or\n\n514\n00:25:47.832 --> 00:25:50.453\nsomewhere other than on the LAN,\nwe don't know where but\n\n515\n00:25:50.453 --> 00:25:54.127\nwherever it is outside the corporate LAN,\nbut using a corporate owned device.\n\n516\n00:25:54.127 --> 00:25:57.212\nIn other words, it is managed and\nhas policy on it and\n\n517\n00:25:57.212 --> 00:26:01.650\nas a result will use a secure\nconnection method and things like that.\n\n518\n00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:04.610\nSo we've got three yeses, one no.\n\n519\n00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.570\nEssentially the same profile but\nwith a different yes no combination\n\n520\n00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.930\nas the user access in the prior example,\nright from the corporate LAN.\n\n521\n00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.740\nSo the question now becomes looking\nback at Manager Access in column two,\n\n522\n00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:18.950\nwell there are all yeses and\ngave full control.\n\n523\n00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:21.830\nAre we gonna give the manager\nthe same level of control\n\n524\n00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:25.420\nwhen they're outside the corporate LAN,\nusing a corporate owned device,\n\n525\n00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.160\nas we do when they're inside the corporate\nLAN, using a corporate owned device?\n\n526\n00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:32.180\nAnd this may or may not be an obvious\npoint of contention, right?\n\n527\n00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.425\nBut from my perspective thinking of this\nas a security professional but also as\n\n528\n00:26:36.425 --> 00:26:40.929\na risk manager, right, and thinking about\nthe need to protect confidentiality,\n\n529\n00:26:40.929 --> 00:26:45.693\ninsure integrity, provide availability,\nthe three pillars of information security\n\n530\n00:26:45.693 --> 00:26:48.431\nmanagement we always refer to for\nanything we do.\n\n531\n00:26:48.431 --> 00:26:52.196\nWell, we have to think about all\nof that from this perspective,\n\n532\n00:26:52.196 --> 00:26:55.134\nI may not be as readily\nthinking it's a good idea.\n\n533\n00:26:55.134 --> 00:26:58.595\nI may not as readily able to\ngrant full control, full access,\n\n534\n00:26:58.595 --> 00:27:02.856\nbecause although we do know the user,\nwe do understand they have a corporate\n\n535\n00:27:02.856 --> 00:27:06.140\nowned device,\nthey are not sitting on the corporate LAN.\n\n536\n00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.780\nAnd they may be subject to\na different level of permissions,\n\n537\n00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.300\ndifferent level of access because we\nmay not control all the variables.\n\n538\n00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.150\nIt's not so much are they\nconnecting with a secure protocol.\n\n539\n00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.780\nIt's not so much that they have the right\nbaseline profile on the machine,\n\n540\n00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.720\nwe can assure all that.\n\n541\n00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.600\nBut what about all of the environmental\nvariables around them?\n\n542\n00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.800\nAre there strangers lurking,\nthat are looking at what they're doing?\n\n543\n00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.297\nAre they gonna get up and walk away\nfrom the machine and forget to lock out\n\n544\n00:27:29.297 --> 00:27:33.220\nthe screen and potentially leave that\nmachine unattended for a period of time?\n\n545\n00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:36.261\nChances are good as a normal user, the\nanswer is probably yes, they will, right?\n\n546\n00:27:36.261 --> 00:27:40.068\nSo we know the chances are good that\nwe may not control the environment\n\n547\n00:27:40.068 --> 00:27:43.152\nthe same way we do when they're\nsitting in the office and\n\n548\n00:27:43.152 --> 00:27:47.502\nwe've got all of our physical logical and\nadministrative controls in place.\n\n549\n00:27:47.502 --> 00:27:49.480\n[COUGH] Excuse me, in place.\n\n550\n00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.240\nSo we wanna think about deriving\na different level of access.\n\n551\n00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.470\nSo what are we thinking here?\n\n552\n00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:56.690\nNot full control, but obviously we\nstill have to give them something.\n\n553\n00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:00.420\n>> Yeah I would say some sort of limited\nfunctionality, limited controller access.\n\n554\n00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.688\n>> Okay, so we may not be more\ndescriptive than that right now.\n\n555\n00:28:02.688 --> 00:28:03.315\nAnd that's fine.\n\n556\n00:28:03.315 --> 00:28:05.550\nSo limited is good, right.\n\n557\n00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:06.876\nAnd we'll go ahead and\nwe'll throw that in there.\n\n558\n00:28:06.876 --> 00:28:11.083\nWe'll probably circle back to find that\nwhen we actually implement this at some\n\n559\n00:28:11.083 --> 00:28:12.430\npoint later.\n\n560\n00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:17.960\nAnd then our fourth user access\ncombination, remote user accessing,\n\n561\n00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.860\nbut from home on our home device,\nor with a home based device.\n\n562\n00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:25.760\nSo you'll see we have almost all ns,\nalmost all nos and one yes.\n\n563\n00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.720\nSo we do know they're a valid user,\nbut that's about the only thing\n\n564\n00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.320\nwe can actually validate\nbeyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n565\n00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.830\nSo what are we going to do here, right?\n\n566\n00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.390\nI'm thinking probably not much, right?\n\n567\n00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.080\nI'm a little risk-adverse these days and\nI'm thinking you know what,\n\n568\n00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.920\nif you're a valid user but\nI know nothing else about you,\n\n569\n00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.220\nI don't know enough to actually\nlet you in, is what I'm thinking.\n\n570\n00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.190\n>> I totally agree with you.\n\n571\n00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:46.270\nI've fallen in that same mindset.\n\n572\n00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.530\nIf you just are a standard user,\nanybody could find out your user ID,\n\n573\n00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:54.330\nso that's not enough for me to say,\nI'm gonna allow you on my network.\n\n574\n00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.090\nI wanna have a little\nmore control over that.\n\n575\n00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.894\nWanna make sure you're running antivirus,\nI wanna make sure that the device in\n\n576\n00:28:59.894 --> 00:29:02.071\nquestion is not a bit\ncompromised in any way.\n\n577\n00:29:02.071 --> 00:29:03.394\nAnd if we don't know those things,\n\n578\n00:29:03.394 --> 00:29:05.610\nI wouldn't feel secure about\nletting them on our network.\n\n579\n00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.240\nSo I would say here,\nno control or no access.\n\n580\n00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.250\n>> No access, okay I'll go with that.\n\n581\n00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.580\nI think that's fair, so\nwe'll put no access up there.\n\n582\n00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.200\nNo control, no access.\n\n583\n00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:16.660\nAnd so as we walk through, and\nDaniel's just kinda typing that out and\n\n584\n00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.820\nfinishing up for us.\n\n585\n00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.450\nAs we walk through this matrix and\nwe think about this, right?\n\n586\n00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.480\nUltimately what we've done over the last\nfew minutes as we've been discussing it,\n\n587\n00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:29.540\nis essentially graphically represent\nthe thought process of how a system would\n\n588\n00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.410\ngrant or deny access control based on the\nclaims or attributes the user presents.\n\n589\n00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.380\nNow this is not just limited to the cloud,\nlet's also just keep that in mind.\n\n590\n00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.998\nThis is essentially the model we would\nuse whether you're in the cloud or not.\n\n591\n00:29:40.998 --> 00:29:43.757\nRemember we've often talked\nabout the fact that most of what\n\n592\n00:29:43.757 --> 00:29:46.299\nwe do in the cloud is not gonna\nbe unique to the cloud, but\n\n593\n00:29:46.299 --> 00:29:48.481\nrather is simply gonna\nbe applied to the cloud.\n\n594\n00:29:48.481 --> 00:29:52.541\nWe're gonna use the same common sense,\nthe same generic approaches,\n\n595\n00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:57.280\nthe same awareness of risk management, the\nsame need to identify and to understand\n\n596\n00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.901\nwho's knocking on that door to let them\nin, so that we can plan to be successful.\n\n597\n00:30:01.901 --> 00:30:05.647\nAnd make sure we don't allow people in\nthat don't belong there trick us and\n\n598\n00:30:05.647 --> 00:30:07.005\nlet the bad actors in.\n\n599\n00:30:07.005 --> 00:30:10.797\nBut also, we wanna make sure that we don't\nkeep out the people that actually do have\n\n600\n00:30:10.797 --> 00:30:12.326\na legitimate reason to be there.\n\n601\n00:30:12.326 --> 00:30:15.638\nSo we wanna manage this idea of false\npositives and false negatives, riht.\n\n602\n00:30:15.638 --> 00:30:20.175\nWhen we talk about error control and\ncorrection with regards to access control.\n\n603\n00:30:20.175 --> 00:30:22.715\nWe often hear the concepts\nof false positives and\n\n604\n00:30:22.715 --> 00:30:25.480\nfalse negatives associated\nwith biometric authentication.\n\n605\n00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:30.020\nBut the reality is, it's a standard\nthought process in any of our areas with\n\n606\n00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.530\nregards to access control, we wanna\nalways as to the best of our ability,\n\n607\n00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.790\nensure that the bad actors are kept out.\n\n608\n00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.209\nSo don't allow people in\nthat don't belong there, but\n\n609\n00:30:38.209 --> 00:30:40.374\nwe also wanna ensure we\nallow the right people in.\n\n610\n00:30:40.374 --> 00:30:44.320\nOf course, stipulating that we allow\nthem in under the right conditions.\n\n611\n00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.420\nSo we want to try and manage down both\nsides of that divide with regards to risk.\n\n612\n00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.573\nSo making sure that we are able to\nshare that information graphically as\n\n613\n00:30:51.573 --> 00:30:54.568\nyou've seen, is really critical\nto the security professional and\n\n614\n00:30:54.568 --> 00:30:57.161\nthe risk management aspect\nof what we're talking about.\n\n615\n00:30:57.161 --> 00:31:01.108\nBecause by getting those as I said\nmultiple peers of eyes kind of interacting\n\n616\n00:31:01.108 --> 00:31:03.300\nright, I may see something one way.\n\n617\n00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.290\nDaniel may come in and\nsee something else and go,\n\n618\n00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:06.920\nhey Adam, did you think about that?\n\n619\n00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.700\nThat combination of access right there,\nthat could be an issue.\n\n620\n00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.460\nAre you aware of that?\n\n621\n00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.160\nHave you documented that?\n\n622\n00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.650\nAre you considering that?\n\n623\n00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.810\nWhatever he may say to draw my\nattention to it would be helpful.\n\n624\n00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.710\nAnd so we wanna lay it out sometimes.\n\n625\n00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:21.820\nBut again remember, there's literally\npotentially hundreds, thousands of\n\n626\n00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.540\npermutations and combinations and\nit may be very tough to test every one.\n\n627\n00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.670\nBut we wanna try to map\nout the obvious ones,\n\n628\n00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:30.580\nthe ones that would most likely\nimpact our daily activities.\n\n629\n00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.770\nAnd have a sense of those.\n\n630\n00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:32.810\nThat would be helpful.\n\n631\n00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.091\nSo it is an optional thought process,\nin the sense that a lot of times\n\n632\n00:31:36.091 --> 00:31:39.606\nthe tools that we use to set up access and\ndo identity access management,\n\n633\n00:31:39.606 --> 00:31:42.101\nkinda indicate all of those and\ndo all this for use.\n\n634\n00:31:42.101 --> 00:31:44.647\nThey don't actually\ngraphically lay it out, but\n\n635\n00:31:44.647 --> 00:31:47.495\nthey have the outcome of\nthe effective result for that,\n\n636\n00:31:47.495 --> 00:31:50.233\naccess control choice you\nmake is represented to us.\n\n637\n00:31:50.233 --> 00:31:52.532\nSo we do see the effect of permissions.\n\n638\n00:31:52.532 --> 00:31:56.025\nOr the intended result of what we're\ndoing, but we still wanna take the extra\n\n639\n00:31:56.025 --> 00:31:58.778\nstep sometimes and\njust walk through it just to have a sense.\n\n640\n00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:00.902\nSo, maybe that's helpful, maybe it's not.\n\n641\n00:32:00.902 --> 00:32:04.263\nBut it is something that as a CCSP,\nwe should at least be aware of and\n\n642\n00:32:04.263 --> 00:32:05.592\nthink about the logic of.\n\n643\n00:32:05.592 --> 00:32:09.266\nWe also need to talk about the concept of\nentitlement and entitlement processes we\n\n644\n00:32:09.266 --> 00:32:12.144\nactually walk through the concept\nduring the demonstration and\n\n645\n00:32:12.144 --> 00:32:15.567\nthe discussion on the table, but\ndidn't really call it out for what it was.\n\n646\n00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:20.960\nThe idea of entitlements is really the\nidea of taking multiple identity sources.\n\n647\n00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.655\nTaking them, providing them or\n\n648\n00:32:22.655 --> 00:32:26.861\nstreaming them into an authorization\nprocess as we walk through and you saw, so\n\n649\n00:32:26.861 --> 00:32:30.148\nthat we can now come on the back-end\nwith access management.\n\n650\n00:32:30.148 --> 00:32:33.021\nAnd decide true, false,\nyes, no, good, bad.\n\n651\n00:32:33.021 --> 00:32:35.096\nWho gets in under what circumstances and\n\n652\n00:32:35.096 --> 00:32:38.279\nwhat areas of the network we\nessentially allow them to get to?\n\n653\n00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:41.360\nBut we have to use an entitlement process,\na set of claims,\n\n654\n00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:45.612\na set of assumptions that are going to be\nmade about access and about conditions and\n\n655\n00:32:45.612 --> 00:32:48.836\nabout whether we're on\nthe corporate network or we're not.\n\n656\n00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:51.444\nWe're remotely connecting,\nwe're inside the LAN.\n\n657\n00:32:51.444 --> 00:32:55.483\nWe're using a corporate owned device,\nwe are not and these are the entitlement\n\n658\n00:32:55.483 --> 00:32:59.352\nrules or thought processes we have to\nconsider and concern ourselves with.\n\n659\n00:32:59.352 --> 00:33:02.568\nWe can almost think of them as\nscenarios that are gathered together.\n\n660\n00:33:02.568 --> 00:33:07.380\nAnd by making these assertions and by\nthinking through the logic of these items,\n\n661\n00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.068\nwe could set up a process\nwhere we have certain\n\n662\n00:33:10.068 --> 00:33:14.051\nrules that are gonna be used to\ngovern the authorization process.\n\n663\n00:33:14.051 --> 00:33:16.728\nSo that if we don't violate those rules,\nwe get in.\n\n664\n00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:18.417\nWe do violate them, we may not get in.\n\n665\n00:33:18.417 --> 00:33:22.947\nSo we showed you in the access control\ntable that we laid out that if we were\n\n666\n00:33:22.947 --> 00:33:26.813\nconnecting from home remotely\non non-cooperative device,\n\n667\n00:33:26.813 --> 00:33:29.143\nwe most likely would give no access.\n\n668\n00:33:29.143 --> 00:33:33.123\nBecause the entitlement process and\nthe entitlement rules would indicate that\n\n669\n00:33:33.123 --> 00:33:37.098\nyou must have a corporate owned device\neven if you're connecting remotely, so\n\n670\n00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:40.423\nthat we can essentially do baseline\nconfiguration management and\n\n671\n00:33:40.423 --> 00:33:42.943\nwe can do remediation\nthrough patch management.\n\n672\n00:33:42.943 --> 00:33:45.988\nAnd we would know the level and\nthe minimum security protection\n\n673\n00:33:45.988 --> 00:33:48.817\nprofile that's being created,\nand used on that device.\n\n674\n00:33:48.817 --> 00:33:53.219\nThere's no malware running, we have\na certain authorized operating system,\n\n675\n00:33:53.219 --> 00:33:54.280\nthings like that.\n\n676\n00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.954\nIf we don't have that, we'd be\nreally uncomfortable letting you in.\n\n677\n00:33:56.954 --> 00:34:01.317\nAnd so we would use that entitlement\nprocess to stipulate what those rules are,\n\n678\n00:34:01.317 --> 00:34:04.130\nattach those rules to\nthe authorization process.\n\n679\n00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.261\nAnd by doing authorization\nwith entitlement rules,\n\n680\n00:34:07.261 --> 00:34:10.667\nwe then get access management\ninto the areas of the network\n\n681\n00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:13.949\nthat is specified based on\nthe outcome of that process.\n\n682\n00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.525\nSo, this is really the formality\nthat we talk about.\n\n683\n00:34:16.525 --> 00:34:18.847\nWe talk about an entitlement process and\n\n684\n00:34:18.847 --> 00:34:22.682\nwe simple show that to you in\nthe demonstration we just engaged in.\n\n685\n00:34:22.682 --> 00:34:25.328\nWe have to have audits and\naudit mechanisms built-in and\n\n686\n00:34:25.328 --> 00:34:26.493\nenabled here, as well.\n\n687\n00:34:26.493 --> 00:34:29.285\nWe have to think about\nthe fact that access control,\n\n688\n00:34:29.285 --> 00:34:32.592\nlike any process is prone to\nsuccess if it's done correctly.\n\n689\n00:34:32.592 --> 00:34:36.054\nBut also can be prone to failure,\nif it's not managed carefully and\n\n690\n00:34:36.054 --> 00:34:39.761\nit is not randomly sampled and\naudited and it's not got traceability and\n\n691\n00:34:39.761 --> 00:34:42.698\nvisibility into the processes\nthat we're engaging in.\n\n692\n00:34:42.698 --> 00:34:47.252\nSo, we should go through and randomly\nsample our user base from time to time.\n\n693\n00:34:47.252 --> 00:34:50.303\nWe should go through and\nunderstand what average users can see.\n\n694\n00:34:50.303 --> 00:34:52.511\nWe should look for\naccounts that have been dormant for\n\n695\n00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:54.535\na period of time that may\nneed to be deactivated.\n\n696\n00:34:54.535 --> 00:34:58.447\nWe should look for\nsuspicious log on activity for accounts or\n\n697\n00:34:58.447 --> 00:35:03.048\nby accounts that is outside the normal\nuse pattern, outside the time,\n\n698\n00:35:03.048 --> 00:35:06.212\noutside the location,\noutside the frequency.\n\n699\n00:35:06.212 --> 00:35:08.564\nThose are the kinda things we\nwould profile and look for.\n\n700\n00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:12.336\nSo we would wanna be auditing and\nthis is part of a broader audiment,\n\n701\n00:35:12.336 --> 00:35:13.804\nI'm making up new words.\n\n702\n00:35:13.804 --> 00:35:17.874\nRisk auditing and management process\nthat we would be wanting to engage in.\n\n703\n00:35:17.874 --> 00:35:21.091\nAccess control is one of those critical\nareas that if we get right and\n\n704\n00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:24.929\nwe understand and we are vigilant and we\nwatch the border, it's a lot less likely\n\n705\n00:35:24.929 --> 00:35:28.619\nthat other risks will propagate into\nthe network and into the organization.\n\n706\n00:35:28.619 --> 00:35:32.016\nBecause we're stopping a lot of the bad\nactors before they can actually\n\n707\n00:35:32.016 --> 00:35:32.701\ngain access.\n\n708\n00:35:32.701 --> 00:35:36.772\nBut if we're not vigilant, if we're\nless than vigilant on the access control\n\n709\n00:35:36.772 --> 00:35:39.931\nupfront, then we maybe very well\nallow bad actors to get in.\n\n710\n00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:42.840\nAnd if we do that the likelihood\nof risk rises dramatically,\n\n711\n00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.218\nbecause the likelihood of bad activity\ngoes up dramatically as well.\n\n712\n00:35:46.218 --> 00:35:48.826\nSo we do have to think about that,\nwe do have to be aware of that.\n\n713\n00:35:48.826 --> 00:35:50.318\nWe should be looking at regulatory.\n\n714\n00:35:50.318 --> 00:35:53.488\nWe should be looking at compliance\nrelated concerns, in other words here.\n\n715\n00:35:53.488 --> 00:35:56.057\nAre we using the right\nstrength of authentication?\n\n716\n00:35:56.057 --> 00:35:58.297\nThe right factors of authentication.\n\n717\n00:35:58.297 --> 00:36:02.249\nIf we're in a regulated industry like\nbiopharmeceuticals like financial\n\n718\n00:36:02.249 --> 00:36:03.889\nservices, like healthcare.\n\n719\n00:36:03.889 --> 00:36:06.228\nWe have to use multi-factor\nauthentication.\n\n720\n00:36:06.228 --> 00:36:08.779\nIt's a stipulated requirement\nin many of those industries,\n\n721\n00:36:08.779 --> 00:36:11.831\nbecause single factor authentication\nis not considered strong enough.\n\n722\n00:36:11.831 --> 00:36:13.485\nAnd so, we have to think about that.\n\n723\n00:36:13.485 --> 00:36:17.040\nIf we're not building\na multi-factor authentication model\n\n724\n00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.864\nin the cloud as we cloud enable\naccess to the data in these systems,\n\n725\n00:36:20.864 --> 00:36:25.052\nwe may actually be in violation of one or\nmore regulatory requirements.\n\n726\n00:36:25.052 --> 00:36:26.233\nThat could lead to jail time,\n\n727\n00:36:26.233 --> 00:36:28.614\ncould lead to financial\npenalties as we've talked about.\n\n728\n00:36:28.614 --> 00:36:29.800\nThat can be an issue.\n\n729\n00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:34.132\nWe should randomly sample and demonstrate\nthe quality, and the standardization,\n\n730\n00:36:34.132 --> 00:36:38.036\nand the global coverage of that system\nin order to be able to validate that for\n\n731\n00:36:38.036 --> 00:36:42.075\nan audit we'd have to be able to randomly\nsample, and document our findings.\n\n732\n00:36:42.075 --> 00:36:44.957\nWe've talked about in one\nof our prior episodes,\n\n733\n00:36:44.957 --> 00:36:49.359\nthe value of the Cloud Security Alliances\nCloud Controls Matrix, the CCM.\n\n734\n00:36:49.359 --> 00:36:50.558\nWe did a demo of it.\n\n735\n00:36:50.558 --> 00:36:51.555\nWe showed it to you.\n\n736\n00:36:51.555 --> 00:36:53.945\nWe explained how it works and\nwhy it's valuable.\n\n737\n00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:57.941\nRemind you here, yet again, another\ngreat place to insert that tool and\n\n738\n00:36:57.941 --> 00:36:58.868\nthink about it.\n\n739\n00:36:58.868 --> 00:37:00.744\nIt would provide you the framework and\n\n740\n00:37:00.744 --> 00:37:04.789\nthe guidance elements across multiple\nframeworks in multiple environments with\n\n741\n00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:07.662\nmultiple controls to cross\nreference the way to implement\n\n742\n00:37:07.662 --> 00:37:11.605\nthat using industry best standard or\nbest practices and standard guidelines.\n\n743\n00:37:11.605 --> 00:37:15.266\nAnd to make sure that governments and\ncompliance are being considered,\n\n744\n00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:18.986\nbecause we are aligned at least in theory\nwe should be aligned with the most\n\n745\n00:37:18.986 --> 00:37:22.663\nappropriate control frameworks and\nregulatory requirements by area.\n\n746\n00:37:22.663 --> 00:37:27.077\nSo it's a very important way to stipulate\nand ultimately to validate auditability,\n\n747\n00:37:27.077 --> 00:37:29.417\nand governance across multiple platforms.\n\n748\n00:37:29.417 --> 00:37:33.803\nSo you wanna refer back to that tool,\nthe CCM, the Cloud Security Alliances,\n\n749\n00:37:33.803 --> 00:37:35.143\nCloud Control Matrix.\n\n750\n00:37:35.143 --> 00:37:39.496\nVery, very important tool for the CCSP to\nbe aware of and to understand how to use.\n\n751\n00:37:39.496 --> 00:37:43.652\nWe wanna think about the fact that in\ncloud computing on cloud platforms,\n\n752\n00:37:43.652 --> 00:37:46.144\nwe have audits that take\nplace all the time.\n\n753\n00:37:46.144 --> 00:37:49.030\nAudits are going to be by in\nlarge a pretty standard and\n\n754\n00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.498\ntemplates way of understanding and\nvalidating assumptions and\n\n755\n00:37:52.498 --> 00:37:56.370\nclaims that you make as the customer,\nclaims that the provider makes.\n\n756\n00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.763\nAnd then we go through and we validate\nthose by examining them, essentially.\n\n757\n00:37:59.763 --> 00:38:03.622\nYou said that door opens at a 45 degree\nangle when I turn the handle to the right.\n\n758\n00:38:03.622 --> 00:38:06.494\nWell, let's go try that and see and\nwe'll measure that and say, yep it does.\n\n759\n00:38:06.494 --> 00:38:07.701\nOr sure enough, you know what?\n\n760\n00:38:07.701 --> 00:38:09.652\nIt opens, but\nI've got to turn it to the left.\n\n761\n00:38:09.652 --> 00:38:12.716\nAnd it only opens 30 degrees, so\nthat claims not exactly correct.\n\n762\n00:38:12.716 --> 00:38:16.120\nWe may have a little bit of difference\nin interpretation, an opinion there.\n\n763\n00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.080\nAnd so, we gotta validate those things and\n\n764\n00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:21.083\nauditing itself is actually\na pretty straightforward concept.\n\n765\n00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:25.794\nWhat gets complicated is the nature of the\naudit in terms of the standards we have\n\n766\n00:38:25.794 --> 00:38:29.379\nto validate and the number of\ncontrols that are in place, and\n\n767\n00:38:29.379 --> 00:38:33.316\nthe documentation that may or\nmay not exist by the customer and, or\n\n768\n00:38:33.316 --> 00:38:37.148\nby the provider or both to show\nus the operational environment.\n\n769\n00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:40.901\nAnd to ensure that we are essentially\nmanufacturing, operating and\n\n770\n00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:45.107\ncontrolling that environment in a way\nthat is stipulated in the regulation,\n\n771\n00:38:45.107 --> 00:38:48.100\nin the standard or\nin the law that we are aligning with.\n\n772\n00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.088\nNow, a lot of times we may do audits\neven though we're not regulated or\n\n773\n00:38:51.088 --> 00:38:54.346\nwe're not controlled and we're not\nworried about the compliance aspect.\n\n774\n00:38:54.346 --> 00:38:58.101\nWe just may wanna do them to validate\nto show customers or to validate for\n\n775\n00:38:58.101 --> 00:39:02.421\nourselves, as well as other parties of\ninterest, that we actually are following\n\n776\n00:39:02.421 --> 00:39:05.262\ncertain actions that are seen\nas being risk adverse.\n\n777\n00:39:05.262 --> 00:39:09.162\nThat are best practices in our industry\nand that we're aligning with them and\n\n778\n00:39:09.162 --> 00:39:12.342\nwe're validating our ability to\ncontrol them even though they\n\n779\n00:39:12.342 --> 00:39:16.259\nmay not be regulated or required by law,\nbecause it's just a good standard.\n\n780\n00:39:16.259 --> 00:39:20.223\nAnd as a result of achieving that\nstandard, we've actually managed risk down\n\n781\n00:39:20.223 --> 00:39:23.587\nin the organization,\nbecause we're minimizing risk by applying\n\n782\n00:39:23.587 --> 00:39:27.748\ncommon best practices that actually are\ngoing to be helping us to be risk adverse.\n\n783\n00:39:27.748 --> 00:39:31.456\nSo, audits are a very good thing and\nwe do them all the time.\n\n784\n00:39:31.456 --> 00:39:34.283\nWe do want to understand though,\nthat in the cloud in particular,\n\n785\n00:39:34.283 --> 00:39:37.111\nbecause we don't always control\nall the cloud infrastructure and\n\n786\n00:39:37.111 --> 00:39:38.893\nwe don't always have access to all of it.\n\n787\n00:39:38.893 --> 00:39:43.228\nThat audits maybe complicated, because\nthe cloud provider may have to take on\n\n788\n00:39:43.228 --> 00:39:47.644\nthe auditor on our behalf and engage and\ndo the audit or they maybe unwilling to.\n\n789\n00:39:47.644 --> 00:39:51.008\nAnd they may not be willing to give us\naccess, to allow us to do the audit.\n\n790\n00:39:51.008 --> 00:39:54.823\nWe neither have to use their prefabbed\naudits that they've conducted for\n\n791\n00:39:54.823 --> 00:39:56.989\ntheir classification of their systems.\n\n792\n00:39:56.989 --> 00:40:00.848\nAnd essentially, their attestation of\ncertain controls that are in place.\n\n793\n00:40:00.848 --> 00:40:04.535\nAnd we have to just rely on that, because\nthe cloud vendor may not be willing to\n\n794\n00:40:04.535 --> 00:40:07.788\nopen up their system and allow our\nauditors to show up at their door.\n\n795\n00:40:07.788 --> 00:40:10.959\nAnd essentially, conduct an audit and\nthis is very common, by the way.\n\n796\n00:40:10.959 --> 00:40:14.989\nIf you think about the fact that large\ncloud providers Microsoft, Googles,\n\n797\n00:40:14.989 --> 00:40:19.405\nAmazons of the world have hundreds of\nthousands, probably millions of customers.\n\n798\n00:40:19.405 --> 00:40:22.656\nThere's no way they could allow audit\nto take place for all those customers.\n\n799\n00:40:22.656 --> 00:40:25.527\nThey would never do anything, but\njust simply have auditors in and\n\n800\n00:40:25.527 --> 00:40:28.102\nout of the system and\nthere would be no way to run the system.\n\n801\n00:40:28.102 --> 00:40:31.597\nAnd there would be one way to respond to\nservice requests when things go wrong cuz\n\n802\n00:40:31.597 --> 00:40:33.958\nthey'd be too busy dealing\nwith audits all the time.\n\n803\n00:40:33.958 --> 00:40:36.816\nAnd there aren't enough hours in\nthe day and enough days in a week, and\n\n804\n00:40:36.816 --> 00:40:39.966\nenough weeks in a month, and enough months\nin the year to be able to conduct all\n\n805\n00:40:39.966 --> 00:40:41.342\nthose audits on a rolling basis.\n\n806\n00:40:41.342 --> 00:40:44.131\nSo they don't allow\nindividual one off audits,\n\n807\n00:40:44.131 --> 00:40:47.608\nthey do a central audit to have\na third party company come in.\n\n808\n00:40:47.608 --> 00:40:49.633\nWhether it's PricewaterhouseCoopers or\n\n809\n00:40:49.633 --> 00:40:52.731\nwhether it is the Deloitte Touche's\nof the world, or whatever.\n\n810\n00:40:52.731 --> 00:40:56.259\nThe big, huge accounting and\naudit and risk management firms.\n\n811\n00:40:56.259 --> 00:40:57.222\nThey will come in.\n\n812\n00:40:57.222 --> 00:41:01.128\nThey'll do an audit for\nthose vendors at least once a year.\n\n813\n00:41:01.128 --> 00:41:03.003\nThey will then use attestation.\n\n814\n00:41:03.003 --> 00:41:06.875\nThey will essentially reproduce the\nfindings of that audit in statement and\n\n815\n00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:10.080\nsay, yes, this company is found\nto be in compliance with these\n\n816\n00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.819\nregulatory requirements,\nthese standards, etc.\n\n817\n00:41:12.819 --> 00:41:16.380\nAnd the company will attest or will\ncertify that they meet these standards and\n\n818\n00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:19.298\nthey'll provide a letter of that\nattestation to that affect.\n\n819\n00:41:19.298 --> 00:41:22.503\nSo that you can, as a customer use\nthat in your audit to say, well,\n\n820\n00:41:22.503 --> 00:41:25.487\nour hosting company is complying\nwith these requirements and\n\n821\n00:41:25.487 --> 00:41:29.613\nhere is our letter of attestation, so that\nMr. and Mrs. auditor, you can see we're\n\n822\n00:41:29.613 --> 00:41:33.266\nposting securely and you were meeting\nthe requirements for our industry.\n\n823\n00:41:33.266 --> 00:41:36.714\nSo you could certainly negotiate with\na cloud provider to get that kind of\n\n824\n00:41:36.714 --> 00:41:37.449\ncoverage, but\n\n825\n00:41:37.449 --> 00:41:41.464\nit's highly unlikely that they're gonna\ngive you access to their systems and allow\n\n826\n00:41:41.464 --> 00:41:45.158\nyou to do a personalized audit unless\nyou've negotiated that ahead of time.\n\n827\n00:41:45.158 --> 00:41:48.483\nAnd unless you're writing a lot of\nchecks with a lot of zeros on the end of\n\n828\n00:41:48.483 --> 00:41:49.102\nthem right.\n\n829\n00:41:49.102 --> 00:41:53.121\nBecause if you're buying dedicated hosting\ninfrastructure, you need very well buy\n\n830\n00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:56.605\nthe right to have an audit on that\ninfrastructure as part of that package.\n\n831\n00:41:56.605 --> 00:41:59.737\nBut that's not the normal way it's\ndone for most companies, just so\n\n832\n00:41:59.737 --> 00:42:00.821\nyou're aware of that.\n\n833\n00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:04.781\nBut as a CCSP, we would need to know\nthat need to understand that and\n\n834\n00:42:04.781 --> 00:42:06.287\nneed to be aware of that.\n\n835\n00:42:06.287 --> 00:42:08.046\nWe wanna work with the cloud provider.\n\n836\n00:42:08.046 --> 00:42:12.600\nIn other words, to ensure that there is\ntransparency, that there is accessibility\n\n837\n00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.832\nand that we have management interfaces\nthat allow us to gather information and\n\n838\n00:42:16.832 --> 00:42:17.683\ncontrol risk.\n\n839\n00:42:17.683 --> 00:42:21.647\nBut that we made partner to do that,\nas opposed to owning that right ourselves.\n\n840\n00:42:21.647 --> 00:42:23.465\nIf this is a private cloud on primp,\n\n841\n00:42:23.465 --> 00:42:26.325\nwe are the cloud provider as\nwell as the cloud customer.\n\n842\n00:42:26.325 --> 00:42:29.082\nWe have the right and\nthe ability to open up our systems, and\n\n843\n00:42:29.082 --> 00:42:30.915\nallow a third party auditor to come in.\n\n844\n00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:34.817\nSo do keep in mind, audits may take place\nin different form with different end\n\n845\n00:42:34.817 --> 00:42:39.094\nresults, depending on the nature of the\ncloud infrastructure that we are running.\n\n846\n00:42:39.094 --> 00:42:42.868\nAnd we do need to think about that and\nbe aware of that, as well.\n\n847\n00:42:42.868 --> 00:42:46.788\nIn addition to all that, again, we have\nto think about the technology involved.\n\n848\n00:42:46.788 --> 00:42:48.344\nVirtual machines, for instance.\n\n849\n00:42:48.344 --> 00:42:51.860\nWe may be able to reach out and\naudit the configuration of VMs,\n\n850\n00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:55.796\nas the cloud customer without\nthe cloud provider getting involved.\n\n851\n00:42:55.796 --> 00:42:59.753\nBut we're gonna be able to audit it under\nthe underlying host infrastructure and\n\n852\n00:42:59.753 --> 00:43:02.198\nthe network infrastructure surrounding it,\nand\n\n853\n00:43:02.198 --> 00:43:05.009\nthe physical controls on\nthat infrastructure outside.\n\n854\n00:43:05.009 --> 00:43:07.863\nSo we may have certain rights\nto certain infrastructure and\n\n855\n00:43:07.863 --> 00:43:10.658\nwe may be able to understand\nhow to provision and manage and\n\n856\n00:43:10.658 --> 00:43:14.267\ncontrol the virtualization, but\nwe may not be able to do much beyond that.\n\n857\n00:43:14.267 --> 00:43:18.267\nAnd that's just one of those things we\nhave to come to grips with as a CCSP and\n\n858\n00:43:18.267 --> 00:43:20.616\nunderstand the values of what we can do,\nbut\n\n859\n00:43:20.616 --> 00:43:23.174\nalso indications of what\nwe're not able to do.\n\n860\n00:43:23.174 --> 00:43:27.658\n>> Yeah, I can see that the a cloud\nprovider might be a little perturbed if\n\n861\n00:43:27.658 --> 00:43:31.002\nyou just start randomly\nend testing their systems.\n\n862\n00:43:31.002 --> 00:43:35.500\nBecause hey, my servers are on there and\nI wanted to do a port scan.\n\n863\n00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:40.320\nWell, without expressed consent for\nthat, they might take exception to it.\n\n864\n00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.849\nSo you do have to work with them, and\nI do that on Microsoft, and the big dogs.\n\n865\n00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:48.393\nThey all make exceptions, like Adam said,\nif you're willing to pony up the dough,\n\n866\n00:43:48.393 --> 00:43:50.313\nwe work with them at the very least.\n\n867\n00:43:50.313 --> 00:43:54.263\nThey will help you out with that, cuz\nthey do want you to be able to verify and\n\n868\n00:43:54.263 --> 00:43:57.088\nmaintain that your data is\nsecure on their systems and\n\n869\n00:43:57.088 --> 00:43:59.562\nbe happy with your level\nof service from them.\n\n870\n00:43:59.562 --> 00:44:02.881\n>> Not just take exception and\nnot just have an issue, but\n\n871\n00:44:02.881 --> 00:44:04.986\nlet's think about this broadly.\n\n872\n00:44:04.986 --> 00:44:08.558\nYou raised actually a really good\npoint and let's examine this for\n\n873\n00:44:08.558 --> 00:44:12.063\na second as we wrap up,\nbecause there's a lot of hidden issues and\n\n874\n00:44:12.063 --> 00:44:15.146\nconcerns in the statement down\njust brought to the fore.\n\n875\n00:44:15.146 --> 00:44:17.654\nWhich is so hey, you go and\npen test your virtual\n\n876\n00:44:17.654 --> 00:44:21.947\ninfrastructure on the common provider\nnetwork, cuz you wanna test your stuff.\n\n877\n00:44:21.947 --> 00:44:24.804\nWell, let's talk about the risk\npropagating through that system,\n\n878\n00:44:24.804 --> 00:44:25.896\nout beyond your pen test.\n\n879\n00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:28.949\nWhat if you pen test and\ncreate a denial of service or\n\n880\n00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:33.919\ndistribute a denial of service event or\npotential event that impacts not just you,\n\n881\n00:44:33.919 --> 00:44:38.605\nbut in a shared cloud environment,\na multi-tenant environment potentially\n\n882\n00:44:38.605 --> 00:44:42.866\nexposes and damages infrastructure\nthat is isolating other tenants.\n\n883\n00:44:42.866 --> 00:44:47.456\nAnd now exposes through a breach\nof confidentiality, integrity or\n\n884\n00:44:47.456 --> 00:44:50.114\navailability, because of that test,\n\n885\n00:44:50.114 --> 00:44:54.639\nmultiple tenants to catastrophic or\ncascading loss of security.\n\n886\n00:44:54.639 --> 00:44:56.648\nControls and as a result, system failures.\n\n887\n00:44:56.648 --> 00:45:00.830\nYou've essentially executed a distributed\ndenial of service or denial of service\n\n888\n00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:04.536\nattack within the cloud provider's\ninfrastructure as a hosted entity,\n\n889\n00:45:04.536 --> 00:45:07.540\nbecause you've broken outside\nyour containment vessel.\n\n890\n00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.686\nYou may not have meant to and\nI'm not suggesting that you would do it on\n\n891\n00:45:10.686 --> 00:45:13.290\npurpose, but one of the reasons\nwe deny this activity and\n\n892\n00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:16.781\ndo not allow it to occur in multi-tenant\nenvironments is this exact issue.\n\n893\n00:45:16.781 --> 00:45:19.540\nBecause if you're not\ndoing it the right way,\n\n894\n00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:24.001\nyou may actually affect those around\nyou and violate their constraints and\n\n895\n00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:27.985\ntheir sandboxes and their bubbles and\nyou may actually now share.\n\n896\n00:45:27.985 --> 00:45:30.121\nBroader and\nwider amounts of infrastructure and\n\n897\n00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:33.253\ninformation than you're meant to see,\nand you may expose everybody.\n\n898\n00:45:33.253 --> 00:45:35.105\nAnd that could be a very,\nvery big problem.\n\n899\n00:45:35.105 --> 00:45:38.062\nSo, there are lots of\nreasons why we do not want or\n\n900\n00:45:38.062 --> 00:45:41.612\nallow this kind of infrastructure\ntesting to take place.\n\n901\n00:45:41.612 --> 00:45:42.945\nThis is out beyond auditing.\n\n902\n00:45:42.945 --> 00:45:44.690\nThis is just more broadly.\n\n903\n00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.420\nBut this is something that again,\nthe CCSP has to be aware of.\n\n904\n00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.092\nBecause we talk about the fact that\nvulnerability assessments, pen testing,\n\n905\n00:45:52.092 --> 00:45:55.561\nthese are standard mechanisms and\nmethods of the security professional.\n\n906\n00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:59.204\nAnd done correctly under the right\nconditions very valuable, but\n\n907\n00:45:59.204 --> 00:46:04.020\ndone in shared common infrastructure pools\nwith multi-tenants, maybe not so much and\n\n908\n00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.402\nmaybe not in your hands.\n\n909\n00:46:05.402 --> 00:46:09.192\nMaybe we, again, transfer\nthe tactical risk to the provider.\n\n910\n00:46:09.192 --> 00:46:11.838\nThe provider is doing that on\nbehalf of all tenants, but\n\n911\n00:46:11.838 --> 00:46:13.935\nyou may not have the right\nto do it yourself.\n\n912\n00:46:13.935 --> 00:46:16.822\nAnd you may have to work with\nthe provider to understand\n\n913\n00:46:16.822 --> 00:46:19.835\nhow to access that information and\ntake advantage of it,\n\n914\n00:46:19.835 --> 00:46:24.076\nbut you have to rely on them to secure the\nborder and to do the border management.\n\n915\n00:46:24.076 --> 00:46:28.443\nYou may not be able to, because your\nsecondary border, your virtual border,\n\n916\n00:46:28.443 --> 00:46:32.679\nyour sandbox or your memory bubble that\nyou operate within inside the larger\n\n917\n00:46:32.679 --> 00:46:35.814\ninfrastructure is essentially\na logical separation.\n\n918\n00:46:35.814 --> 00:46:37.431\nIt's not a physical boundary.\n\n919\n00:46:37.431 --> 00:46:40.117\nAnd as a result of that,\nin most cases, anyway.\n\n920\n00:46:40.117 --> 00:46:43.229\nIt's not, you could have dedicated\ninfrastructure, it may very well be, but\n\n921\n00:46:43.229 --> 00:46:45.143\nlogically more often\nthat not than physically.\n\n922\n00:46:45.143 --> 00:46:48.776\nAnd as a result, you are not allowed\nto test that logical boundary,\n\n923\n00:46:48.776 --> 00:46:53.005\nbecause you may violate it and violate\nthe constraints it imposes on hosting.\n\n924\n00:46:53.005 --> 00:46:55.606\nAnd as a result,\nit may expose other people to harm.\n\n925\n00:46:55.606 --> 00:46:58.960\nAnd that's a very big concern and\nsomething you need to understand, as well.\n\n926\n00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.283\nSo it's actually an excellent point you\nmake and one that we wanna make sure\n\n927\n00:47:02.283 --> 00:47:05.518\nwe share, and that we're very clear\non as we wrap up our conversations.\n\n928\n00:47:05.518 --> 00:47:06.341\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n929\n00:47:06.341 --> 00:47:10.050\nWell, you have definitely taken us\nthrough a very good in-depth look.\n\n930\n00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.634\nAs security controls\nthe mechanisms that we make and\n\n931\n00:47:12.634 --> 00:47:16.628\nwant to implement in our design of our\ninfrastructure, especially when it comes\n\n932\n00:47:16.628 --> 00:47:20.818\nto things like identity management or just\nidentity and authorization in general.\n\n933\n00:47:20.818 --> 00:47:24.003\nAs well as, well,\nwhat we were just Just talking about.\n\n934\n00:47:24.003 --> 00:47:28.095\nThe fact that we need to audit what's\ngoing on to make sure that what we're\n\n935\n00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:30.010\ndoing is what we say we're doing.\n\n936\n00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.641\nWe wanna make sure those things\nare actually happening and\n\n937\n00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:33.667\nwe thank you for that.\n\n938\n00:47:33.667 --> 00:47:37.720\nWe thank you for dropping by and joining\nus and we thank you guys for watching, but\n\n939\n00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.518\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n940\n00:47:39.518 --> 00:47:40.784\nWe're ITProTV.\n\n941\n00:47:40.784 --> 00:47:42.259\nI've been your host Daniel

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:17.813\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:21.938\nin today's episode we are continuing on\nwith our Certified Cloud, what is that.\n\n5\n00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.178\nThe Security Professional,\nI almost said Support Professional.\n\n6\n00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:27.006\nBut we're security professionals in this-\n>> I told you if you did it long enough\n\n7\n00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:28.486\n[CROSSTALK] you'd screw it up.\n\n8\n00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:28.988\n>> That's right.\n\n9\n00:00:28.988 --> 00:00:30.117\n>> You would not say it the right way.\n\n10\n00:00:30.117 --> 00:00:30.738\n>> And guess what?\n\n11\n00:00:30.738 --> 00:00:31.765\nWho's joining us today?\n\n12\n00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:35.580\nIt's our good friend Adam Gordan\nto help us continue that trek.\n\n13\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.310\nAdam, how you doing today and\nhow's it going?\n\n14\n00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.070\n>> It is going well,\nI'm doing good and there we are.\n\n15\n00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.050\nSo now that we've got that out of the way,\nlet's talk a bit about BC, BCDC.\n\n16\n00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.755\nNow I'm you in a shorter form.\n\n17\n00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.735\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> BCDR, business continuity and\n\n18\n00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:51.890\ndsaster recovery.\n\n19\n00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.300\nSo we've been talking a lot about risk,\n\n20\n00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.730\nwe've been talking about infrastructure,\nwe talked about cloud data security.\n\n21\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.148\nWhat we have add to the mix in this\ngrouping of episodes around this area, or\n\n22\n00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:04.950\nknowledge area, is the idea of disaster\nrecovery and business continuity.\n\n23\n00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.687\nHow do we deal with the unexpected,\nboth in the cloud and\n\n24\n00:01:07.687 --> 00:01:11.367\noutside of the cloud generically, but\nspecific to the cloud in this case.\n\n25\n00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:15.774\nWe were talking in our last episode\nabout planning for the unexpected,\n\n26\n00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:19.678\nbeing able to anticipate what you can,\ncontrol what you know.\n\n27\n00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:24.300\nBut then also be prepared, right, for\nthe unanticipated, for the unexpected.\n\n28\n00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.740\nWe can't anticipate, we can't plan for\nevery access control scenario for\n\n29\n00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.284\ninstance.\n\n30\n00:01:28.284 --> 00:01:31.631\nAs you remember, in the last episode\nwe walked through a nice little demo.\n\n31\n00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:33.838\nWe set up an access control matrix for\nyou and\n\n32\n00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:37.320\nwe took a look at how we could use\nthat as a visual planning tool.\n\n33\n00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.720\nTo better understand how to manage access\ncontrol, identity and access management,\n\n34\n00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.300\nand ultimately manage the risks\nassociated with provisioning access\n\n35\n00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.950\nto cloud-based resources.\n\n36\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.418\nSo we took a look at that concept.\n\n37\n00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:48.260\nIf we broaden that and\n\n38\n00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.500\napply it to the idea of,\ncan we map out, can we anticipate,\n\n39\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.960\ncan we document, can we control for the\nmajority of things we may need to address?\n\n40\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.570\nThe answer is sure, we can.\n\n41\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.880\nThe question is what's the best approach,\n\n42\n00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.820\nwhat's the best mechanism,\nwhat are the best tools to do so?\n\n43\n00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.875\nAnd DRBC PDR, a business continuity,\n\n44\n00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:08.075\nBCDR rather, business continuity\ndisaster recovery planning.\n\n45\n00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:10.785\nBCDRP, actually, if we get that right.\n\n46\n00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:14.895\nIs really the idea of the thought process,\nthe focus of how we anticipate, how we\n\n47\n00:02:14.895 --> 00:02:19.262\nplan for, and how we document our thoughts\nand assumptions around what can go wrong.\n\n48\n00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:23.260\nAnd how we will then approach dealing with\nthe disruptions that may interrupt our\n\n49\n00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.377\nability to consume both cloud services and\n\n50\n00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:28.520\nprovide coud-based\ninfrastructure access to data.\n\n51\n00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.350\nWe have to understand and\nremind ourselves constantly\n\n52\n00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.340\nof the fact that this is\na shared responsibility matrix.\n\n53\n00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.270\nIn the sense that the cloud provider,\nas well as the cloud customer,\n\n54\n00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.140\nwill most likely play a part, indeed will\nalmost without exception always play\n\n55\n00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.213\na part in the disaster recovery and\nbusiness continuity planning cycles.\n\n56\n00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:49.990\nAs well as the execution of BC and\nDR plans if ever called upon.\n\n57\n00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.130\nBecause the infrastructure,\nas we know, is going to managed and\n\n58\n00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.430\nis going to be owned\nby the cloud provider.\n\n59\n00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.820\nWe may borrow it,\nwe may rent it if you will.\n\n60\n00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.720\nWe may certainly manage aspects of it for\na period of time,\n\n61\n00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.620\nwe will certainly consume on it.\n\n62\n00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.140\nBut we don't ultimately own and\nare responsible for\n\n63\n00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.410\nit at every level of the architecture.\n\n64\n00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.210\nAnd because there's that split level of\nresponsibility and dual ownership, we have\n\n65\n00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.425\nto also have extended that thought process\nfor BCDR into the same environment.\n\n66\n00:03:17.425 --> 00:03:20.580\nAnd we have to make sure we\nwork with the cloud provider,\n\n67\n00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.030\nunderstand their abilities, their\nconcerns, what their response times are.\n\n68\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.102\nWe'll manage those typically through\nsomething like an SLA for instance.\n\n69\n00:03:28.102 --> 00:03:33.080\nAnd then use that understanding to then\ndrive our abilities and our focus and\n\n70\n00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.220\nour planning, as the customer,\nto be as prepared as we can be.\n\n71\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.800\nBut also understand we have to rely\non others and therefore extend trust\n\n72\n00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.830\nin this relationship to fully execute\non BCDR cycles or BCDR plans.\n\n73\n00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.868\nAnd so understanding the cloud environment\nwith regards to BCDR can be complex.\n\n74\n00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:53.565\nWe talked in one of our prior episodes\nquickly, we kind of threw out there\n\n75\n00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:57.824\nthe thought process of how we may see BCDR\nultimately evolve and apply in the cloud.\n\n76\n00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:01.695\nAnd we have three standing options\nmost likely that we will engage in.\n\n77\n00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:05.135\nWe talked about this I think when\nwe actually did the Microsoft\n\n78\n00:04:05.135 --> 00:04:06.465\ntop ten fact list.\n\n79\n00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:08.075\nBut we also took a look\nat their hosting map,\n\n80\n00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:10.945\nif you remember, you were kind enough\nto drive us through that on the web.\n\n81\n00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:13.635\nWe took a look at the different\nareas we could host in on that\n\n82\n00:04:13.635 --> 00:04:14.945\ninfrastructure platform.\n\n83\n00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:18.075\nAnd I talked about the fact that\nwe could fail into the cloud for\n\n84\n00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:21.285\nBCDR, from on-prem and\ninto the cloud in other words.\n\n85\n00:04:21.285 --> 00:04:25.463\nFail through the cloud, one provider\nto another across that platform.\n\n86\n00:04:25.463 --> 00:04:29.972\nSo we could essentially either fail within\nthe same cloud provider platform or\n\n87\n00:04:29.972 --> 00:04:32.030\nfail from one provider to another.\n\n88\n00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.450\nIt really just depends.\n\n89\n00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.530\nAnd we can fail out of the cloud, coming\nback out of the cloud back on-prem,.\n\n90\n00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.333\nAnd then actually have\nthe resultant situation or\n\n91\n00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:42.970\nsolution be controlled by us again for\na period of time.\n\n92\n00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.100\nNow remember,\nif we are the cloud provider and\n\n93\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.085\nwe're doing private on-cloud prem,\nprivate on cloud prem.\n\n94\n00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:50.800\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On-prem private cloud.\n\n95\n00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.850\nIt's opposite day here at ITProTV.\n\n96\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.950\nAnd we're going to be talking in\nbackwards compatible technology terms.\n\n97\n00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.000\nAnd also backward language\ncompatible terms.\n\n98\n00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.170\nSo we'll say everything backwards and you\nhave to then to spin it back around and\n\n99\n00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.584\nput it in the proper\nterminology frame of reference.\n\n100\n00:05:04.584 --> 00:05:08.481\nSo when we think about the idea of\nbeing able to fail into the cloud,\n\n101\n00:05:08.481 --> 00:05:13.300\nwe're thinking about the fact that if we\nare running private cloud on-prem we're\n\n102\n00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.030\nfailing not into the Cloud,\ncuz we're already in the cloud.\n\n103\n00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.562\nBut rather, we're running private\ninfrastructure that's not cloud-based but\n\n104\n00:05:19.562 --> 00:05:21.989\nis most likely going to be\ntraditional infrastructure.\n\n105\n00:05:21.989 --> 00:05:26.228\nWe're gonna fail from our DR environment\nor, excuse me, fail out of our normal\n\n106\n00:05:26.228 --> 00:05:30.080\nproduction environment,\ninto our DR environment, into the cloud.\n\n107\n00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.790\nNow we may use the cloud as\na carrier network to fail across.\n\n108\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.253\nWe may actually have a hosting model that\nallows us to call on cloud services on\n\n109\n00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:41.355\ndemand although we are paying for\nthem as a baseline.\n\n110\n00:05:41.355 --> 00:05:45.256\nWe will then fail into the cloud to\nhost there for a period of time.\n\n111\n00:05:45.256 --> 00:05:48.160\nSo we're gonna fail out of traditional\ninfrastructure most likely,\n\n112\n00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.170\ninto the cloud in this first model.\n\n113\n00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.030\nSo this is on-premises, right,\nwe're starting with on-prem\n\n114\n00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.620\ntraditional infrastructure and\nwe're failing it over into the cloud.\n\n115\n00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.147\nNow we may fail Into the cloud from\nour on-prem cloud into a third party\n\n116\n00:06:01.147 --> 00:06:02.538\nprovider's cloud.\n\n117\n00:06:02.538 --> 00:06:06.820\nBecause our on-prem cloud may fail and\nwe have to fail over to another provider.\n\n118\n00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.190\nSo this is yet\nanother way we can imagine this.\n\n119\n00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.200\nWe are failing off our\ncloud into another cloud.\n\n120\n00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.430\nThis would be failing from one\ncloud provider to another.\n\n121\n00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.150\nWe call that failing through the cloud.\n\n122\n00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.820\nEssentially, we're failing\nbetween platforms.\n\n123\n00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.510\nSo one platform stops working,\n\n124\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.470\nwe pick up DR on the other\nplatform on the other side.\n\n125\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.063\nSo this would be our private on-prem\ncloud being failed over to Amazon or\n\n126\n00:06:28.063 --> 00:06:33.275\nfailed over to the Microsoft Azure fabric\nas a hosting and co-location DR event.\n\n127\n00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:34.962\nSo that would be something to consider.\n\n128\n00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:39.238\nWe maybe on Microsoft's fabric, or\non Google's fabric or on Amazon's fabric.\n\n129\n00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:40.614\nAnd we may lose continuity and\n\n130\n00:06:40.614 --> 00:06:44.560\nconnectivity in one of their data centers\nbecause of an issue on their side.\n\n131\n00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.260\nThey may automatically fail us through\ntheir private cloud essentially,\n\n132\n00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.910\ninto another hosted cloud\nsomewhere in their architecture.\n\n133\n00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.930\nWhere they have resiliency, redundancy,\nand probably mirroring capabilities or\n\n134\n00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.500\nlive migration capabilities to\nmove our data in real time.\n\n135\n00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.830\nWe're failing through their cloud network,\nbut simply are coming up on\n\n136\n00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.680\nanother area or in another infrastructure\nregion and we're still running there.\n\n137\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.783\nThat would typically be handled by\nthe cloud service provider, not by us.\n\n138\n00:07:11.783 --> 00:07:12.499\nIn other words,\n\n139\n00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.740\nwe would not control the failover within\nthe cloud fabric of the provider.\n\n140\n00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.660\nWe would simply be notified\nthat we had been failed over\n\n141\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:22.370\nafter some sort of delay or\nperiod of time based on our SLA.\n\n142\n00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.580\nBut if we're failing from our cloud\nback into the cloud provider,\n\n143\n00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.117\nthen we would actually be\nin control in part of that.\n\n144\n00:07:28.117 --> 00:07:31.580\nCuz we'd have to work with the provider to\nbe able to bring that infrastructure up.\n\n145\n00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.360\nSo there's different ways this may happen.\n\n146\n00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.660\nWe may fail from one\nprovider's network to another.\n\n147\n00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.076\nWe may say, we run normally on Azure but\n\n148\n00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:42.950\nin a disaster scenario we're going to\nfail over to Amazon, or vice versa.\n\n149\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.507\nThat's a lot more complicated to architect\nbecause there's no connection between\n\n150\n00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:49.369\nthose two platforms that the providers\nare actually gonna give us.\n\n151\n00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:52.836\nWe're gonna have to essentially create\nour infrastructure in both places,\n\n152\n00:07:52.836 --> 00:07:56.106\nand we may have a significant delay\nin bringing that infrastructure up.\n\n153\n00:07:56.106 --> 00:07:59.828\nBecause we may have to bring VMs up and\nload them into the other fabric.\n\n154\n00:07:59.828 --> 00:08:03.730\nWe may have to actually network them and\ncreate the infrastructure.\n\n155\n00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.580\nOr we may duplicate it in both places so\nthe building blocks are in place, but\n\n156\n00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.880\nthe actual VMs will have to then\nbe cycled into the new platform.\n\n157\n00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.540\nSo we have to upload them or we may\nhave them there essentially turned off,\n\n158\n00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.510\nlike parked at a certain moment in time\nfrom some sort of snapshot or a backup.\n\n159\n00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:20.885\nAnd then bring them up and\nload new data into them.\n\n160\n00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:22.640\nThere's different ways we\ncan handle this over time,\n\n161\n00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.315\nbut there would be a delay\nin being able to do that.\n\n162\n00:08:25.315 --> 00:08:29.050\nAnd we don't normally see catastrophic\nfailure on the Amazon or Microsoft\n\n163\n00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.940\nfabric that requires us to fail over to\nthe other vendor, but it is an option.\n\n164\n00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.366\nIt may not be a good one for\nmany people, but it is an option.\n\n165\n00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:38.840\nSo we wanna understand,\nfailing into, failing out of, and\n\n166\n00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:44.240\nfailing through the cloud are all\noptions that we could employ as a CCSP\n\n167\n00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.110\nwhen we are dealing with BCDR, business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery planning.\n\n168\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.920\nThe trick here is to understand that as\na security professional, we may or may not\n\n169\n00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:56.510\nbe involved in the actual planing of\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery.\n\n170\n00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.980\nWe may be on the receiving end of a plan.\n\n171\n00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.190\nWe may have to vet the plan.\n\n172\n00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:02.940\nWe may actively take part\nin aspects of the plan\n\n173\n00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.850\nto ensure that there is\nsecurity built into and\n\n174\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.540\nsecurity available through the continuity\nor recovery exercises we engage in.\n\n175\n00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.470\nBut we may not be\nthe architects of the plan,\n\n176\n00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:14.350\nespecially when it comes to the cloud.\n\n177\n00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.740\nThe cloud architect, the cloud storage\narchitect, the cloud data architect,\n\n178\n00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.000\nthe cloud application architect\nmay all play a part individually.\n\n179\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.290\nOr if this is all rolled up into one role,\nthey all play a part.\n\n180\n00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:29.950\nOr individually that one role may play\nthe part of planning this particular\n\n181\n00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:30.530\noperation.\n\n182\n00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.100\nWe may simply just be a player,\nas opposed to an architect here.\n\n183\n00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.520\nUnlike where in the physical world,\ntraditionally outside of the cloud,\n\n184\n00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.149\nsecurity again may or may not be\nan active player in the architecting,\n\n185\n00:09:41.149 --> 00:09:44.680\nbut it’s more likely that we would\nbe involved in the planning.\n\n186\n00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.520\nBecause they need our expertise to figure\nout how to do this when we're moving bits\n\n187\n00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.660\nand bytes back and\nforth across secure connections.\n\n188\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.640\nExcuse me, from one network to the other.\n\n189\n00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.110\nSo, we do wanna think about this and\nbe aware of this.\n\n190\n00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.220\nWhen we talk about business continuity,\nwe talked about disaster recovery.\n\n191\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.860\nAre we good to define those terms?\n\n192\n00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.020\nIf we play a little what's my role,\nwhat's my vocabulary definition game?\n\n193\n00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.560\nHow are we feeling about this?\n\n194\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.675\n>> All right,\nwe should be able to do that game.\n\n195\n00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.502\n>> Yeah, that was a lot of mumbling for\na yes or a no.\n\n196\n00:10:11.502 --> 00:10:12.927\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n197\n00:10:12.927 --> 00:10:15.280\nlet's put Dave up to the test here.\n\n198\n00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.240\nIt's the afternoon, we gotta keep him on\nhis toes, he's nodding off over here,\n\n199\n00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.650\nstanding next to me,\nnot actually actively participating.\n\n200\n00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.650\nAnd we don't wanna\nmarginalize him too much.\n\n201\n00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.601\nOr he gets bored and he starts surfing the\nweb and we never know what's gonna pop up.\n\n202\n00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:28.998\nSo let's think about\nthe definition of these two terms.\n\n203\n00:10:28.998 --> 00:10:32.077\nWhen we think about business continuity,\nwe think about disaster recovery.\n\n204\n00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:35.320\nOne of the things I often find with\ncustomers, especially with students in\n\n205\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.049\nparticular when we're dealing\nwith exam related knowledge,\n\n206\n00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:41.250\nis there maybe some confusion,\nright, with regards to these terms?\n\n207\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.960\nThey may not be able to define\nthem clearly and understand them.\n\n208\n00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.710\nSo wanna make sure we're\ncomfortable with the definitions.\n\n209\n00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.970\nSo let's talk about business\ncontinuity first for just a moment.\n\n210\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.390\nWhat do we think the definition,\n\n211\n00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.010\nthe operational definition of\nbusiness continuity may be?\n\n212\n00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:58.600\n>> I would say that it's the ability\nto continue doing business in light of\n\n213\n00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.180\nproblems, for lack of a better term,\na very generalized idea.\n\n214\n00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.770\nThat I wanna continue being able to\nprovide a service or create a product, or\n\n215\n00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:08.170\nwhatever it is my business does.\n\n216\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.790\nI wanna continue doing that regardless of\n\n217\n00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.730\noutlying factors that may\nbe trying to inhibit that.\n\n218\n00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.020\nOr maybe not trying to inhibit that,\nbut that are working toward that end.\n\n219\n00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.470\n>> All right, so good,\ngenerally in the ballpark.\n\n220\n00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.940\nLet's see if we can tailor and\nscope that, narrow that just a bit.\n\n221\n00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.380\nYou said we wanna continue to do business,\nright?\n\n222\n00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.258\nAnd yes, continuity, continue,\nsynergy there, absolutely.\n\n223\n00:11:30.258 --> 00:11:34.390\nBut let's refine that or\nrefocus that a little bit.\n\n224\n00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.860\nInstead of continuing to do business,\nwould it be better,\n\n225\n00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.970\nwould it be safer,\nwould it be more accurate to say\n\n226\n00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:43.950\nwe are looking to engage in activities\nthat allows us to return to normal.\n\n227\n00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:49.137\nTo establish or reestablish the ability\nto do business the way we normally would.\n\n228\n00:11:49.137 --> 00:11:51.981\n>> In my mind I jump to disaster\nrecovery at that point.\n\n229\n00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:56.836\nBecause we're saying that we want to get\nback to doing business instead of not\n\n230\n00:11:56.836 --> 00:12:00.666\nhaving an uninterrupted stream\nof business capabilities.\n\n231\n00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:03.241\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right, which is my exact point and\n\n232\n00:12:03.241 --> 00:12:05.010\nthe exact confusion most people have.\n\n233\n00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.890\nSo, business continuity is actually\nabout restoring the capacity\n\n234\n00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:10.090\nto get back to normal.\n\n235\n00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.995\nFiguring out how to go back to normal.\n\n236\n00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:15.780\nWhereas disaster recovery is about\nstabilization of the environment,\n\n237\n00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:16.670\npost disaster.\n\n238\n00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:20.435\nSo, you walk in and there's a smoldering\nruin where your data center was Monday\n\n239\n00:12:20.435 --> 00:12:23.275\nmorning, and you've got fires and\n\n240\n00:12:23.275 --> 00:12:28.425\nyou've got people that have been hurt and\nthings of that nature.\n\n241\n00:12:28.425 --> 00:12:32.315\nDR, Disaster Recovery, is about\nresponding to that immediate incident and\n\n242\n00:12:32.315 --> 00:12:36.155\nstabilizing the environment so\nthat no additional damage takes place.\n\n243\n00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:39.555\nBC, Business Continuity,\nis about returning to normal.\n\n244\n00:12:39.555 --> 00:12:41.930\nWe often refer to it as going home.\n\n245\n00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:46.230\nIn the language of the trade, meaning we\nwant to return to normal and get back to,\n\n246\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.890\nas you were indicating,\nnormal business activity.\n\n247\n00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.730\nBut there may be a series of steps\nwe have to go through to get there.\n\n248\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.490\nWe may have to restore systems.\n\n249\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.690\nWe may have to actually go to tape,\n\n250\n00:12:55.690 --> 00:13:00.940\nwe may have to bring on recovery sites for\na period of time and operate out of there.\n\n251\n00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.900\nThis is where that\nconfusion often happens,\n\n252\n00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:06.440\nbecause you say disaster recovery,\nwe're going to our hot site to recover.\n\n253\n00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.080\nSo we're back to normal,\neverything's good, that's DR, right?\n\n254\n00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.380\nWell, no the stabilization\nof the environment is DR.\n\n255\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.193\nThe ability to then make the decision\nthat we ultimately have to recover and\n\n256\n00:13:16.193 --> 00:13:20.708\nestablish a sense of normalcy to return\noperations, is business continuity.\n\n257\n00:13:20.708 --> 00:13:25.550\nOvertime we will then have to migrate out\nof that recovery site back to the normal\n\n258\n00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.380\nsite, when the disaster team has stabilize\nthat environment and indicated to us,\n\n259\n00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.680\nin whatever form,\nthat it maybe safe to return.\n\n260\n00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.830\nSo, there's a definite break\nbetween the terms here and\n\n261\n00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.140\nwe wanna make sure we're clear and\nwe're comfortable on the definition.\n\n262\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.910\nIt is often a point of confusion, which is\nwhy I always wanna stress it when we talk\n\n263\n00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.730\nabout these things, talk about this area\n\n264\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.930\nto make sure we're comfortable with the\nactivities that take place in both places.\n\n265\n00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.370\nIt's very very important.\n\n266\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.720\nSo the idea of being able to return to\nnormal is this idea of re-establishing or\n\n267\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.120\nin some cases just continuing\nthe process of establishing continuity.\n\n268\n00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:03.440\nContinuing the process of business as\nnormal or whatever that means, but\n\n269\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.450\nit may be interrupted by disasters.\n\n270\n00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.835\nAnd when disasters happen,\nwe have to stop the disaster.\n\n271\n00:14:08.835 --> 00:14:11.110\nInsurance's not gonna\nbother us anymore and\n\n272\n00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:14.030\nthen turn our attention towards\nthe idea of getting back to normal.\n\n273\n00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.130\nSo differentiate between\nthese two activities.\n\n274\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:20.970\nWe may very well, depending on the size of\nthe organization, have different teams.\n\n275\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.230\nA lot of times small organizations,\nyou're an army of one.\n\n276\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.280\nYou often hear people talk\nabout that in IT all the time.\n\n277\n00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.450\nI do a lot,\nI do a lot of different things.\n\n278\n00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.140\nIt may just be literally me and\none or two other people,\n\n279\n00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.270\nand everybody's kind of\nknowledgeable about everything.\n\n280\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:35.340\nWe don't specialize.\n\n281\n00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.616\nWe don't have a storage admin, and\na routing person, and a directory team.\n\n282\n00:14:39.616 --> 00:14:41.790\nIt's the three of us,\nwe all do everything.\n\n283\n00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.640\nSo in those environments there's\nprobably no differentiation, and\n\n284\n00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.200\nthat's why there's a lot of confusion.\n\n285\n00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.310\nBecause in those environments everybody\nsays well we just get it all fixed and\n\n286\n00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.470\nwe put it all back through them,\nit's all just one big them.\n\n287\n00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.010\nSomebody said there's a problem,\nthe server went down, we fixed it,\n\n288\n00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:55.460\nwe're back to normal, it's all good.\n\n289\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.860\nThat's disaster recovery right?\n\n290\n00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:58.575\nWe recovered from the disaster.\n\n291\n00:14:58.575 --> 00:15:00.720\nWell yeah it is, but we actually stop and\n\n292\n00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.320\ndifferentiate phases when we\nare talking about informally planning,\n\n293\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.660\nbecause in larger environments you may not\njust be three people doing everything.\n\n294\n00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.930\nYou may have a dedicated disaster\nteam that shows up on site,\n\n295\n00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.515\ntypically first responders and\nincident responders.\n\n296\n00:15:14.515 --> 00:15:18.740\nThey're gonna roll up on site, figure\nout what's wrong, stop the bleeding so\n\n297\n00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.460\nto speak and\ndeal with stabilizing the patient.\n\n298\n00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.210\nYou have a separate group that's gonna go\nsomewhere else, spin up the recovery site,\n\n299\n00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.200\nand actually start continuity\nactivities to recover services and\n\n300\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.950\nto re-establish business.\n\n301\n00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.440\nAnd that's gonna be a very\ndifferent set of activities than,\n\n302\n00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.080\nhey, the building's on fire.\n\n303\n00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.690\nLet's make sure we get\nthe servers shut down.\n\n304\n00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:41.113\nLet's make sure, if possible, get\neverybody out and make sure they're good.\n\n305\n00:15:41.113 --> 00:15:44.608\nAnd then let's worry about how to\nreestablish not only continuity, but let's\n\n306\n00:15:44.608 --> 00:15:48.066\nmake sure we can go in and figure out\nwhat was damaged and what's still viable.\n\n307\n00:15:48.066 --> 00:15:51.027\nThat may be a very separate team from,\nin the meantime we're\n\n308\n00:15:51.027 --> 00:15:54.705\ngonna go over here down the road,\nwe're gonna start up the recovery site.\n\n309\n00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:57.130\nWe're gonna get the customers\nreconnected to the web, and\n\n310\n00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.945\nwe're gonna keep doing business\nwhile you guys figure out whether or\n\n311\n00:15:59.945 --> 00:16:02.828\nnot we can come back here, or\nwe should stay there for a period of time.\n\n312\n00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:04.746\n>> But at that point, we're not back to,\n\n313\n00:16:04.746 --> 00:16:07.490\nwe're not into the business\ncontinuity at that point.\n\n314\n00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.365\nWe're still in DR, because we're not-\n>> No, we've split.\n\n315\n00:16:10.365 --> 00:16:11.541\n>> We've split, okay.\n\n316\n00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:13.354\n>> We've split, so in other words,\nwith the team that is there saying,\n\n317\n00:16:13.354 --> 00:16:14.014\nlet's put the fire out.\n\n318\n00:16:14.014 --> 00:16:15.001\n>> Right.\n>> Let's do an inventory.\n\n319\n00:16:15.001 --> 00:16:15.698\n>> They're doing DR.\n\n320\n00:16:15.698 --> 00:16:18.912\n>> Let's figure out, they're doing DR\n>> The team that goes down the road and\n\n321\n00:16:18.912 --> 00:16:23.077\nis saying let's spin up the recovery site,\nlet's get the hot site rolling,\n\n322\n00:16:23.077 --> 00:16:26.858\nlet's make sure that we can provide or\ncontinue to provide services,\n\n323\n00:16:26.858 --> 00:16:30.470\ncuz maybe we haven't lost the web\nservers because of the fire.\n\n324\n00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:33.200\nBut there's the possibility,\nbecause of the damage to the building,\n\n325\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.550\nthat the power is gonna have\nto be shut down, right?\n\n326\n00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.943\nFPL is gonna come in or whoever it is, and\nthey're gonna shut us off and we can't\n\n327\n00:16:38.943 --> 00:16:42.455\nspin up the generator cuz they'll worry\nabout running fuel where there's fire.\n\n328\n00:16:42.455 --> 00:16:44.800\nAnd those two things don't\ntend to mix very well, right?\n\n329\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.260\nSo you don't wanna do that and\nthat kind of stuff,\n\n330\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:49.630\nso we're essentially going offline,\nright, we're about to go dark.\n\n331\n00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:50.770\nThat's a disaster.\n\n332\n00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:54.815\nWe're dealing with that, we're gonna make\nsure we safeguard the environment and\n\n333\n00:16:54.815 --> 00:16:56.270\nsafeguard the people there but\n\n334\n00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:59.480\nthe recovery option to continue\nbusiness is not gonna be there.\n\n335\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.670\nIt's gonna be somewhere else.\n\n336\n00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.670\nSo that business continuity function is\nabout getting that recovery site up and\n\n337\n00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:08.040\nrunning, and cutting over, failing over,\nwhatever you wanna call it,\n\n338\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.510\nswitching over,\nrefer to it all sorts of different ways.\n\n339\n00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:14.250\nBut essentially continuing service\nout of that alternate location,\n\n340\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.100\nthat's business continuity.\n\n341\n00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:17.069\nPeople confuse the two.\n\n342\n00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:19.345\nCuz we're going to the recovery site, DR.\n\n343\n00:17:19.345 --> 00:17:22.680\nNo, you're going to the recovery\nsite to continue business.\n\n344\n00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.785\nAnd as a result,\nyou're engaging in continuity activities,\n\n345\n00:17:25.785 --> 00:17:27.610\nand/or we failed over seamlessly.\n\n346\n00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.550\nIt's all automated, but somebody's gotta\nthen manage that until we fail back.\n\n347\n00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.230\nThat's also part of business continuity.\n\n348\n00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.910\n>> So just because we're not\ndoing business in a regular way,\n\n349\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:39.440\nwe're still doing business to\nthe end user in a regular way.\n\n350\n00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.610\nThey see no difference.\n\n351\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.557\nThey're able to-\n>> Hopefully they don't, hopefully.\n\n352\n00:17:42.557 --> 00:17:45.664\n>> If you're an online site and you're\nselling things, they're able to buy, sell,\n\n353\n00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:46.773\ndo whatever it is that you do.\n\n354\n00:17:46.773 --> 00:17:51.590\n>> In theory, I mean, we never know for\nsure what level of disruption will occur.\n\n355\n00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.500\nWe can plan for things.\n\n356\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.160\nWe just don't know until it happens, and\n\n357\n00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.225\nwe're not sure if it will or\nwill not become apparent to the customer.\n\n358\n00:17:57.225 --> 00:18:01.185\nThe site may run slow, there may be\na delay in not taking the orders.\n\n359\n00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:05.955\nBut shipping goods out because our\nbackend distribution systems are totally\n\n360\n00:18:05.955 --> 00:18:09.183\nscrewed up because of the fire, because\neverything ran out of that warehouse.\n\n361\n00:18:09.183 --> 00:18:12.752\nSo now we've gotta worry about an\nalternate supply chain to do distribution.\n\n362\n00:18:12.752 --> 00:18:15.492\nThere's things that can go wrong\nrippling through the system.\n\n363\n00:18:15.492 --> 00:18:17.792\nBut if the front end is\nessentially looking and\n\n364\n00:18:17.792 --> 00:18:20.902\nfeeling the same,\nthe customer to your point may never know.\n\n365\n00:18:20.902 --> 00:18:25.686\nAnd the goal of BCDR is to ensure the\ncustomer does not experience a failure,\n\n366\n00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:27.276\ndoes not experience a delay.\n\n367\n00:18:27.276 --> 00:18:31.466\nIn theory, knows that there is nothing\nwrong, or doesn't assume there is.\n\n368\n00:18:31.466 --> 00:18:33.126\nBut we can't always reach that mark.\n\n369\n00:18:33.126 --> 00:18:37.314\nI mean, it may be apparent to the customer\nthat there's been a problem when we show\n\n370\n00:18:37.314 --> 00:18:41.444\nup on the ten o'clock news and they're\ntalking about the fact that the five alarm\n\n371\n00:18:41.444 --> 00:18:45.298\nfire that occurred at the downtown\nlocation for company Y was just put out.\n\n372\n00:18:45.298 --> 00:18:49.266\nAnd it was the single largest fire in\nthe last 20 years in the area is probably\n\n373\n00:18:49.266 --> 00:18:53.080\na tip, right, for most users that\nthere may be a problem going on.\n\n374\n00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.110\nI mean, these things happen and\n\n375\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.250\nwe don't always know what the outcome's\ngonna be with regards to communication.\n\n376\n00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.960\nBut, the reality is, if the services\nare there, if the continuity is there,\n\n377\n00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:05.370\nif the ability to continue operating\nis there, the customer, number one,\n\n378\n00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.620\ndoesn't care, and number two,\nmay not even know.\n\n379\n00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.170\nWe may or may not pay attention to that.\n\n380\n00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:14.668\nA customer running on the Microsoft\nplatform in Office 365 on Azure doesn't\n\n381\n00:19:14.668 --> 00:19:18.827\nknow when Microsoft fails you over from\neast coast to west coast in the US,\n\n382\n00:19:18.827 --> 00:19:20.657\nor in theory from US to Ireland.\n\n383\n00:19:20.657 --> 00:19:21.795\nThey have no way of knowing.\n\n384\n00:19:21.795 --> 00:19:24.165\nAll they know is that they still\nget to their infrastructure,\n\n385\n00:19:24.165 --> 00:19:25.312\ntheir VMs are still running.\n\n386\n00:19:25.312 --> 00:19:26.986\nAt least that's what they\nwanna know anyway, right.\n\n387\n00:19:26.986 --> 00:19:29.570\nAnd so as long as they know that,\nas long as that's working,\n\n388\n00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.440\nwe don't care about anything else.\n\n389\n00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.410\nHonestly, cloud customers\ndon't care about the details,\n\n390\n00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.880\nthey just care about the outcomes.\n\n391\n00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.540\nAnd I think it's fair\nto say all customers,\n\n392\n00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.740\nalmost without exception, care about\noutcome, they don't care about details.\n\n393\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.410\nThe idea of risk management is that\nthe customer doesn't want the risk and\n\n394\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.730\nthe liability of owning\nthe infrastructure.\n\n395\n00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.300\nThey don't wanna know the gory\ndetails of how dinner's made.\n\n396\n00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.130\nThey just wanna know it shows up on\nthe plate and it looks and tastes good.\n\n397\n00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:54.570\nThat's the secret behind good BCDR.\n\n398\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.280\nDon't expose to the customer\nunnecessary details.\n\n399\n00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.760\nJust get it done.\n\n400\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.680\nMake it transparent to your point, right.\n\n401\n00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.780\nI don't wanna know, when my systems\nfail over, I wanna know after the fact,\n\n402\n00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.350\nI wanna be told by the way,\nthis is what's going on.\n\n403\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:07.000\nI don't wanna know why you're doing it,\n\n404\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.150\nI want you to focus on doing it right,\nright?\n\n405\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.730\nDon't get on the phone and tell me, just\nget it done, and tell me after the fact.\n\n406\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.080\nI don't want you distracted.\n\n407\n00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.260\nI want you to be focused on what you're\ndoing to make sure it doesn't impact me.\n\n408\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.070\nThat's just good basic BCBR,\nrisk management 101, right?\n\n409\n00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.350\nFly the plane, land the plane, then\napologize to the passengers about having\n\n410\n00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.680\nto fly the plane and land the plane out of\nthe normal sequence and cycle of events.\n\n411\n00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.160\nSo always focus on making\nsure the continuity is there.\n\n412\n00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.410\nIt's very important.\n\n413\n00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:36.210\nBut we wanna make sure we differentiate\nand understand between the roles,\n\n414\n00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.500\nbecause it is, as I said, sometimes\nnot as clear as it should be, right?\n\n415\n00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.140\nSo what is the roving cloud\ninfrastructure we would deal with here?\n\n416\n00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:47.040\nWell, hosts that are running and obviously\nproviding virtualized infrastructure\n\n417\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.530\nwould be very important,\nwe may have to fail those over.\n\n418\n00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:53.050\nSo we may want resource clustering\ncapabilities, we may want HA,\n\n419\n00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.710\nhigh availability, FT, full tolerance,\nraid capabilities on the storage side.\n\n420\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:58.930\nWe wanna have redundancy.\n\n421\n00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.435\nWe talked about back up power,\nUPS systems, generators,\n\n422\n00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:06.730\nmulti-pathing, so multiple network\npaths to get to storage and\n\n423\n00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.510\nget to all sorts of different\ninfrastructure, excuse me.\n\n424\n00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.650\nSo we're gonna have more than one path,\nthings like NIC teaming\n\n425\n00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:16.560\nto have multiple physical NICs\navailable coming out of the hosts, so\n\n426\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.820\nthat virtual machines have\na pathway that is uninterrupted.\n\n427\n00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.600\nWanna differentiate and make sure we\nunderstand how all these things may come\n\n428\n00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.050\ntogether and how we interact with them.\n\n429\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:27.840\nBut we know redundancy is one of the key\nthings that business continuity and\n\n430\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.960\ndisaster recovery planning rests on.\n\n431\n00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.240\nIf one system is good,\n\n432\n00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.380\ntwo systems that do the same things\nare better because we don't want to have\n\n433\n00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:37.420\na single point of failure if we\ncan avoid it, if at all possible.\n\n434\n00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.800\nSo, wanna think about that, wanna make\nsure we have backups of our data.\n\n435\n00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.310\nJust common sense stuff, right?\n\n436\n00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.650\nHave templates that we can use\nto quickly spin VMs back up.\n\n437\n00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.570\nHave our data backed up, so if we have to\nrestore it, while there may be a delay,\n\n438\n00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.670\ndelays are acceptable if we understand\nwhat the parameters are, and\n\n439\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.940\nwe've established measurements,\nmetrics around them.\n\n440\n00:21:55.940 --> 00:22:00.370\nIn one of our prior episodes, we talked\nabout RPOs, Recovery Point Objectives,\n\n441\n00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:04.880\nMTD, Maximum Tolerable Downtime,\nand RTO, Recovery Time Objective.\n\n442\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.960\nI defined those terms for you.\n\n443\n00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.085\nI'll remind you again, very important\nto know the definitions of those terms.\n\n444\n00:22:10.085 --> 00:22:14.630\nRPO is the time measurement of the amount\nof data that we're willing to walk away\n\n445\n00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:18.230\nfrom, we're willing to lose,\nin order to be successful at restoration.\n\n446\n00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.330\nThat could be seconds, minutes,\nhours, days, it really depends.\n\n447\n00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:22.810\nIt's a flexible measure.\n\n448\n00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.980\nIt's set by the cloud administrator,\nwhoever that entity or\n\n449\n00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.300\nrole is that's in charge of that cloud\ninfrastructure based on the amount of data\n\n450\n00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.740\nthat the organization feels is\nappropriate to have on hand.\n\n451\n00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.120\nIf we say we have a 15-minute RPO,\nwhat we're essentially saying\n\n452\n00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:44.260\nis that we will be willing to lose up\nto 15 minutes of data as we restore,\n\n453\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.478\ndepending on when the failure\noccurred with regards to our backup.\n\n454\n00:22:47.478 --> 00:22:53.220\nBecause a 15-minute RPO implies that we\nare backing up data every 15 minutes and\n\n455\n00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.090\nwe're willing to lose up to 15\nminutes of transactional data.\n\n456\n00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.650\nIf the failure occurs at the very\nbeginning of that cycle, we just backed\n\n457\n00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.000\nup, let's say hypothetically, and\nwe're like a minute into the 15-minute\n\n458\n00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.010\ncounter towards the next back up, we're\nonly gonna lose about a minute's worth of\n\n459\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.520\ntransactional data even though\nthe window is up to 15 minutes.\n\n460\n00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.360\nBut if we're like 14, 14 and\na half minutes on that cycle and\n\n461\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.290\nthe failure occurs and we haven't backed\nup, yeah, because we are just getting to\n\n462\n00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.585\nthe end of that, we may lose up to\n15 minutes of transactional data.\n\n463\n00:23:20.585 --> 00:23:25.900\nCuz in theory all the data that's been\nin the system happening in realtime,\n\n464\n00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.810\nbeing aggregated, being used, may not\nhave been captured since the last backup.\n\n465\n00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.200\nIndeed, we know it hasn't been.\n\n466\n00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.050\nSo we could lose up to\nthat amount of data.\n\n467\n00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.393\nThat's the RPO measure.\n\n468\n00:23:34.393 --> 00:23:39.117\nThe RTO, recovery time objective, is\nthe earliest possible time in the recovery\n\n469\n00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:43.771\nscenario where if everything goes right,\njust all the stars and planets align,\n\n470\n00:23:43.771 --> 00:23:48.304\nwe can hope to actually bring the systems\nback online and have them available.\n\n471\n00:23:48.304 --> 00:23:51.785\nBut that's the earliest possible\nbenchmark that we can do that by.\n\n472\n00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:57.840\nThe MTD, maximum tolerable downtime,\nis the outer marker on that bench mark.\n\n473\n00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.950\nRTO is the earliest possible time.\n\n474\n00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:05.980\nMTD right, if this is RTO over here, MTD\nis gonna be somewhere down here, because\n\n475\n00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:11.460\nMTD says if you can do it by RTO great\nwe're done, we don't worry about MTD.\n\n476\n00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:16.250\nBut if you can't do it by RTO, then\nyou've got a window between RTO, right?\n\n477\n00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.812\nI have to shake the opposite hand\nwhen I'm looking at it on the screen.\n\n478\n00:24:18.812 --> 00:24:22.100\n>> RTO, right, and then MTD over here.\n\n479\n00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.640\nThis is the last possible time\nmeasure that you can recover by.\n\n480\n00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.660\nThe gap between these two right here,\n\n481\n00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:31.390\nright, is the time that we use if we\ndon't get it right the first time and\n\n482\n00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.730\nwe need a second or third shot\nbefore we get to the end marker.\n\n483\n00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.120\nThat's the delta, that timeline that\nwe can use to have success in the temps\n\n484\n00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.445\nat restoration before we\nget to the end marker.\n\n485\n00:24:42.445 --> 00:24:45.060\nMTD represents the outer marker\n\n486\n00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:48.890\non the recoverability on that\nsystem before we declare disaster.\n\n487\n00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.400\nMaximum tolerable key, tolerable downtime.\n\n488\n00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.560\nI can afford to be down for that period of\ntime, after that something has to change.\n\n489\n00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.070\nWe're not doing what we need to do,\n\n490\n00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:01.650\nwe have to do what's called declaring\na disaster, put a line in the sand.\n\n491\n00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:05.370\nAt that point when we hit MTD,\nwe now have to make a decision and\n\n492\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.320\nsenior management makes this decision.\n\n493\n00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.950\nLet's be clear, they declare a disaster\nif we cross that MTD threshold,\n\n494\n00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.070\nthat is the action.\n\n495\n00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.570\nThat is the catalyst\nthat typically indicates\n\n496\n00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.120\nthat we should declare a disaster.\n\n497\n00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:20.260\nAt that point, our DR plans, our BC plans,\n\n498\n00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.100\nfind out what the issue\nis kick into effect.\n\n499\n00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.580\nUp until that point we\nare attempting to recover services.\n\n500\n00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.150\nWe are attempting to ensure continuity but\n\n501\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:35.200\nwe are not executing our DR plan until\na DR, a disaster event has been declared.\n\n502\n00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.450\nPeople again often confuse this,\nthey think well something went wrong,\n\n503\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.680\nI'm starting to recover, I'm\nimmediately executing my disaster plan.\n\n504\n00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.470\nNo your not, the building's not on\nfire,there hasn't been an earthquake and\n\n505\n00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.020\nwe didn't have a tidal wave, right?\n\n506\n00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.810\nThere hasn't been a disaster,\nthere's been an outage, right?\n\n507\n00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.370\nThere's been an event that's\nled to a system outage, or\n\n508\n00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:56.640\nmultiple systems are affected and that\nmight very well be a disaster, but until\n\n509\n00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:02.170\nyou ultimately pass the MTD boundary,\nyou have not declared a disaster formally.\n\n510\n00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.320\nYou may preempt that by saying,\nokay hey listen everything is down,\n\n511\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.230\nforget about how long it's\ngoing to take to restore.\n\n512\n00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:10.290\nWe got a disaster,\njust start fixing everything.\n\n513\n00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:13.630\nYou may decide that but\nunless you declare that formally,\n\n514\n00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.960\nyou're not actually executing\nyour DR plan formally.\n\n515\n00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.380\nYou may be doing it informally, but\n\n516\n00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.070\nyou haven't made a formal\ndisaster declaration.\n\n517\n00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:23.130\nI would differentiate\nbetween this to ensure\n\n518\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.570\nthat we understand that there are certain\nactivities that are called for\n\n519\n00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:31.620\nin the plan that may not formally happen\nunless the plan is being executed\n\n520\n00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.270\nin sequence by the people identified\nby role with the appropriate oversight.\n\n521\n00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.150\nAnd if those things are not happening,\n\n522\n00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:41.480\nyou're not actually doing disaster\nrecovery according to your plan.\n\n523\n00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.730\nYou may be doing according\nto a separate playbook,\n\n524\n00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:45.860\nthat is used to restore a certain system.\n\n525\n00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.840\nIt's not the same thing\nas disaster recovery.\n\n526\n00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.770\nSo we wanna make sure we differentiate\nhere, it's very, very important.\n\n527\n00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:53.440\nSo we need to understand,\nthat we need reliable systems.\n\n528\n00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.470\nWe have to eliminate\nsingle points of failure.\n\n529\n00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.010\nWe have to understand what RPO, RTO, MTDR.\n\n530\n00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.220\nDefining those terms is crucial for\nthe cloud\n\n531\n00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.960\nsecurity professional because we have to\nunderstand how to measure recoverablity.\n\n532\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.250\nAnd how to work with our partners\nto ensure we're all playing off\n\n533\n00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.930\nthe same set of assumptions, right?\n\n534\n00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:17.100\nWe're down, our SLA says anything past two\nhours of down time equals a disaster and\n\n535\n00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.940\nnow we're gonna have something else occur.\n\n536\n00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.880\nThere's financial penalties,\nthe provider has to now\n\n537\n00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.500\nstart talking to me every hour gives\nme service updates, things like that.\n\n538\n00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.850\nThat only kicks in when\nwe declare it a disaster.\n\n539\n00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:31.500\nThat happens at the moment\nthat we surpass or bypass MTD.\n\n540\n00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.548\nThis is important int\nthe formality of the cloud.\n\n541\n00:27:33.548 --> 00:27:37.010\nBecause remember, for outsourcing\nto a third party vendor we have to\n\n542\n00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:41.690\nagree on what the rules are and agree on\nthe definition of operational parameters.\n\n543\n00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.980\nIf we don't have that agreement,\nI may think you're in the middle of doing\n\n544\n00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.810\nsomething you're not, and\nyou may think I'm doing something I'm not.\n\n545\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:51.190\nAnd I may think we have a disaster and\nyou may think it's business as usual.\n\n546\n00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.800\nAnd that can obviously be very\nvery problematic for everybody,\n\n547\n00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:58.990\nso we wanna understand that business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery\n\n548\n00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:03.420\nare things we have to negotiate on and\nestablish concrete meanings around.\n\n549\n00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.800\nWe can't just assume\nthat they're gonna recur.\n\n550\n00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.530\nWe should understand that there are\ncertain requirements that will have to be\n\n551\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:12.520\nstipulated we have to document what\nthose business requirements are.\n\n552\n00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.570\nThe way we figure out business\nrequirements is through some sort of\n\n553\n00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:16.272\nanalysis.\n\n554\n00:28:16.272 --> 00:28:18.269\nWhich have we do requirements analysis and\n\n555\n00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:21.663\nrequirements gathering to understand\nwhat the requirements are a BIA.\n\n556\n00:28:21.663 --> 00:28:26.130\nA Business Impact Analysis is usually\na very good way to understand and rank and\n\n557\n00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.720\nprioritize the requirements the business\nhas for system availability.\n\n558\n00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.820\nWhen we do a BIA, which is an internal\npart of risk management and\n\n559\n00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.580\nrisk assessment,\nwe take the output of that\n\n560\n00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.580\nwhich is typically driven by a pretty\nrobust requirements gathering process.\n\n561\n00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.190\nWe interview all the system owners,\nwe say well,\n\n562\n00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.920\nwhich systems do you\nthink are most important?\n\n563\n00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.710\nOf course everybody is\ngonna say their own.\n\n564\n00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.990\nSo the email system owner says email,\nthe database owner says database, but\n\n565\n00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.520\nthen we put all that stuff together,\nwe kind of try to rank and\n\n566\n00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.870\nprioritize what we think\nis gonna be the case.\n\n567\n00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:57.480\nWe go back and\n\n568\n00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.600\nreport back to the group typically senior\nmanagers, maybe some of these line owners.\n\n569\n00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.260\nAnd we essentially at the end of the day\nhave to come up with a negotiated\n\n570\n00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.580\nprioritized ranking or\nordering of system priority or\n\n571\n00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.300\nof service priority in the organization.\n\n572\n00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.310\nWe all think we can't live without\nemail but you know what as we look at\n\n573\n00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:18.240\neverything, we realize email may\nnot be the most important system.\n\n574\n00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.560\nMaybe it's our frontend to our CRM\ndatabase or our frontend to our customer\n\n575\n00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.540\norder portal because we're worried about\nrevenue more than we are about email.\n\n576\n00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.260\nSo maybe CRM winds up\nbeing the number one app.\n\n577\n00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.810\nSo we gotta rank all that figure that out.\n\n578\n00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.350\nPeople often say can't live without\nfile and print, well really?\n\n579\n00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.070\nI mean you don't have to be able\nto print during a disaster.\n\n580\n00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:40.120\nYou've gotta be able to understand\nthe status of your systems and\n\n581\n00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.550\ncommunicate effectively.\n\n582\n00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:45.690\nI would think VoIP or voice communication\nand email may be ranked higher than\n\n583\n00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:49.380\nfile and print in many cases but you know\nit depends, it depends on the system.\n\n584\n00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:51.160\nSo as a result we got\nto figure all that out.\n\n585\n00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.390\nWhen we're done we have a prioritized\norder that is approved by senior\n\n586\n00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:55.110\nmanagement.\n\n587\n00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.390\nThat tells us what systems are most to\nleast important in the organization\n\n588\n00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.190\nin the event of a disaster.\n\n589\n00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.590\nIn the event of a continuity issue we can\nlook to that list and figure out what to\n\n590\n00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:09.880\nrestore in order to make sure we have\nthe appropriate level of system access.\n\n591\n00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:12.340\nBut the trick is we have to have\nthat in place ahead of time.\n\n592\n00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.510\nYou can't stand there when\nthe building is burning down and\n\n593\n00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:17.290\nthink about what you would like to\nhave versus what you need to have,\n\n594\n00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.510\nit's just not a very good\ntime to try to do that.\n\n595\n00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.691\nThings are not clear,\nit's very very difficult,\n\n596\n00:30:21.691 --> 00:30:24.582\nthere's a lot of external factors\nthat you're pretending with and\n\n597\n00:30:24.582 --> 00:30:26.728\nit's not the right time to\ntry to figure that out.\n\n598\n00:30:26.728 --> 00:30:30.524\nSo we have to do that ahead of time, so a\nBIA is a very important component of this.\n\n599\n00:30:30.524 --> 00:30:36.266\nWe take the output of that and then we use\nthat to manage and to vet our BCDR plans.\n\n600\n00:30:36.266 --> 00:30:40.400\nAre we addressing the right systems\nbased on priority ordering?\n\n601\n00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.690\nAre we understanding where the right\nsolutions need to be used or\n\n602\n00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.690\nhow those solutions need to\nbe used to ensure continuity?\n\n603\n00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.650\nDoes the cloud provider offer\nus the capability to work and\n\n604\n00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:53.240\nto restore those systems and if so,\nhow and are we documenting that?\n\n605\n00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.855\nDo we have the right contact information?\n\n606\n00:30:54.855 --> 00:30:57.050\nAnd this happen all\nthe time with customers.\n\n607\n00:30:57.050 --> 00:31:00.080\nThey have an outage,\nthey call up the cloud provider and\n\n608\n00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.530\ntry to open a service ticket.\n\n609\n00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:05.310\nWhoever they say they may come to you and\nsay, Daniel hey I'm knee deep in this,\n\n610\n00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:08.920\nI can't do this, here's the information,\nplease get on the phone with him or\n\n611\n00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.750\ncall support for Amazon or\nGoogle, or Microsoft, or\n\n612\n00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:14.480\nwhoever, and tell them,\nwe're having an outage.\n\n613\n00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.900\nIf there's not already a service ticket\nopen because it's not just affecting us,\n\n614\n00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.560\ncan you please make sure,\nright, that you get one open?\n\n615\n00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.480\nSo you get on the phone and the first\nthing they tell you after you get through\n\n616\n00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.870\nthe automated system is okay great Daniel,\nwhat company do you work for?\n\n617\n00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:27.610\nYou give them the name.\n\n618\n00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:28.410\nWhat's the account number?\n\n619\n00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.030\nWhat's the username?\n\n620\n00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:29.890\nWhat's the password?\n\n621\n00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.060\nIf you don't have that stuff, guess what?\n\n622\n00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.390\nThey're not talking to you.\n\n623\n00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:37.050\nYou may be the designated\nrepresentative in the provider's\n\n624\n00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.830\neyes in sense of the customer's eyes,\nyou may be the designated representative.\n\n625\n00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.670\nIn the eyes of the provider, your not.\n\n626\n00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:45.461\nIf your not that authorized\ndesignated administrative contact,\n\n627\n00:31:45.461 --> 00:31:47.466\nyou don't exist as far\nas they're concerned.\n\n628\n00:31:47.466 --> 00:31:48.408\nUnfortunately, and\n\n629\n00:31:48.408 --> 00:31:51.501\nin the middle of a disaster you may\nnot have time to go back and get that.\n\n630\n00:31:51.501 --> 00:31:55.380\nSo I tell my customers, document all\nthat stuff have it written down in your\n\n631\n00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.552\nplaybook, in your BCDR documentation.\n\n632\n00:31:57.552 --> 00:32:00.550\nFirst page of the plan should\nsay here's our providers.\n\n633\n00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.410\nHere's the contact info.\n\n634\n00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.680\nHere's the usernames.\n\n635\n00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.840\nHere's the passwords.\n\n636\n00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.240\nHere's the account info.\n\n637\n00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:10.579\nWhoever gets that book, should be able to\ngo through and establish communication and\n\n638\n00:32:10.579 --> 00:32:13.422\nauthoritatively speak on\nbehalf of the organization.\n\n639\n00:32:13.422 --> 00:32:16.602\nIf you don't have that, you're not gonna\nfind that when the disaster happens,\n\n640\n00:32:16.602 --> 00:32:18.450\nit's just not gonna be available.\n\n641\n00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.250\nAnd from a security\nstandpoint you may say,\n\n642\n00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.920\nwell but do we wanna write all that down?\n\n643\n00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:25.410\nDo we wanna have the passwords and\nusernames out there in plain sight.\n\n644\n00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.480\nI'm not suggesting you write it down,\nput it on the shelf, and\n\n645\n00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.780\nput a big sign on it that says here is\nour access to our account information,\n\n646\n00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:33.440\nunencrypted, please take.\n\n647\n00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.980\nBut what I am suggesting is,\n\n648\n00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:39.010\nin the way in which you structure and\ncontrol that information.\n\n649\n00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:41.430\nPut access control on it,\nput change control on it.\n\n650\n00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:45.040\nValidate access to it, but\nmake it available to authorized users.\n\n651\n00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.690\nSo a lot of my customers say, great Adam.\n\n652\n00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:50.435\nSo we'll store it up in SharePoint or in\nthe file and print system or whatever, and\n\n653\n00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:51.479\nwe'll have it there.\n\n654\n00:32:51.479 --> 00:32:54.613\nGreat until the problem is that the DR\n[LAUGH] then implies that you have no\n\n655\n00:32:54.613 --> 00:32:55.900\naccess to that system.\n\n656\n00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.110\nWhich it may very well.\n\n657\n00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.420\nSo what's the backup, I ask?\n\n658\n00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:02.118\nSo you've got it there that's good, it's\nunder change and version management there,\n\n659\n00:33:02.118 --> 00:33:05.321\nit's got access control, good thought\nprocess, great way to secure that,\n\n660\n00:33:05.321 --> 00:33:06.300\nlike that a lot.\n\n661\n00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.390\nBut what's the risk associated with that?\n\n662\n00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.410\nThe risk is system availability, right?\n\n663\n00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.820\nSo what's the backup plan?\n\n664\n00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.820\nBecause remember we got to\nhave a secondary system so\n\n665\n00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.300\nthere's no single point of failure.\n\n666\n00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.510\nSo if I can't get to the data\nin SharePoint or WebSphere or\n\n667\n00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:23.230\nwherever, do I have a hard copy of it\nlocked up in a safe in somebody's office,\n\n668\n00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.380\nlocked up in a vault right somewhere?\n\n669\n00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.770\nIs it taped to the underside of the desk,\nI don't know wherever it would be.\n\n670\n00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:30.400\nBut the point is do you have it somewhere?\n\n671\n00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.000\nIf you say no, I'm gonna say great,\n\n672\n00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.870\nlet's go figure that out because\nbefore the next event happens,\n\n673\n00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:38.340\nyou better be able to get that out\nof that system in some other form.\n\n674\n00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.560\nAnd this is why we have to walk through\nthese things as a cloud security\n\n675\n00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.540\nprofessional, right?\n\n676\n00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.490\nWe have to understand these things.\n\n677\n00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.740\n>> Adam,\nI actually got to be a part of that.\n\n678\n00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.080\nI lived about an hour away.\n\n679\n00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.920\nI was probably about 40 miles away\nfrom where I actually worked.\n\n680\n00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.720\nSo they gave me a hard copy of that and\nI kept that in my file cabinet at home and\n\n681\n00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.868\nwe also kept another hard copy\nthat was off site technically.\n\n682\n00:33:58.868 --> 00:34:04.490\nIt way past our parking lot in a metal\nbuilding inside of a fire proof vault or\n\n683\n00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.807\na fire proof safe that\nonly IT had access to.\n\n684\n00:34:07.807 --> 00:34:08.841\n>> Yeah, it's very important, and\n\n685\n00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:10.347\nyou raise really good points about this,\nright.\n\n686\n00:34:10.347 --> 00:34:14.330\nSo, I talk to customers all the time\nabout having the backup system.\n\n687\n00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:18.560\nSo you have the Daniel with the file\ncabinet 30 minutes away or an hour away or\n\n688\n00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.420\nwhatever it was.\n\n689\n00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.680\nSo you're geographically separating\nthe plan and the recovery option\n\n690\n00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:27.120\nfrom the source typically of the disaster,\nthat's really good because if there was\n\n691\n00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.380\na fire God forbid or\nthere was an event who knows what.\n\n692\n00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.143\nBut if something happened at the main\nsite they have done several things.\n\n693\n00:34:33.143 --> 00:34:35.438\nThe plan was on site in\na fire proof vault so\n\n694\n00:34:35.438 --> 00:34:37.650\nif there was a fire in\ntheory would have survived.\n\n695\n00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:42.010\nIt also also separated from there by by\n60 minutes of travel time, 30 miles or\n\n696\n00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.230\nwhatever it would have been.\n\n697\n00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.430\nSo if it was a fire then it wouldn't\nhave reached both sides simultaneously.\n\n698\n00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:49.970\nIf it was a hurricane or something, it\nmay have affected both sites at once, but\n\n699\n00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:52.860\nthe reality is while that may or\nmay not have been good enough, we would\n\n700\n00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.120\nthen hopefully have an alternate site that\nwas several hours away geographically so\n\n701\n00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.750\nthat way we are outside\nthat immediate impact zone.\n\n702\n00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.380\nAnd this is the other thing we\ngotta think about with cloud.\n\n703\n00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.590\nBecause cloud is so ubiquitous,\nso always on so always available,\n\n704\n00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.430\nwe don't always think about the borders\nand the geography of cloud because we\n\n705\n00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.730\nessentially go out of our way to make sure\nthat we don't think of it that way and\n\n706\n00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:14.550\nas a result it's kind of everywhere so\nwe don't think about it being anywhere.\n\n707\n00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.670\nBut this is one of the fallacies of cloud,\n\n708\n00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.180\njust like the fallacies\nassociated with wireless.\n\n709\n00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.570\nWireless is not truly wireless.\n\n710\n00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:24.210\nWireless is semi wireless with\nwired access on the back end.\n\n711\n00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:27.130\nAnd we have to think about\ncloud as being semi cloud.\n\n712\n00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:31.420\nIt is partially ubiquitous, partially\nall available, partially borderless, but\n\n713\n00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.300\nat some point you wind up\nback on fixed infrastructure\n\n714\n00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:38.350\nin an exact geographic location pinned\nto the ground that isn't moving.\n\n715\n00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.690\nAnd as a result of that, you've go to\nunderstand that there is geography\n\n716\n00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:43.480\ninvolved with managing the cloud.\n\n717\n00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.720\nThere is risk involved in that geography.\n\n718\n00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.280\nAnd there is management of that risk\n\n719\n00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.050\nthat must be brought to bear in\norder to understand how to recover.\n\n720\n00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:56.390\nIf I am recovering into the same geography\nthat the actual data site is in and\n\n721\n00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:59.110\nthe data site's blown out\nby a catastrophic event,\n\n722\n00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.700\nwhat do you think's going to\nhappen to my recover capability?\n\n723\n00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.140\nIt's going to be gone before\nI even get to deploy it.\n\n724\n00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:06.610\nI tell costumers all the time,\ndon't co-locate,\n\n725\n00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:10.210\ndon't fail over to where you\nactually host primarily.\n\n726\n00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:16.260\nI have customers in Florida,\nSouth Florida that are hosting and then\n\n727\n00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.690\ndisaster recovering potentially within the\nsame geography 10, 20, 30, 40 miles away.\n\n728\n00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.930\nYou get a hurricane if you live in the\nsouth or if you live in the south east or\n\n729\n00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.260\nyou live in the West Coast or\neven in the Gulf states of the U.S.\n\n730\n00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.330\nanywhere probably except North Dakota,\nright?\n\n731\n00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.290\nYou pretty much know that\nduring hurricane season,\n\n732\n00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:34.610\nyou got to pay attention to the weather.\n\n733\n00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:37.690\nBut you also know the hurricanes\ncan be hundreds of miles long\n\n734\n00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.620\nby a hundreds of miles wide and\nthey can move 20, 30, 40 miles an hour.\n\n735\n00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.770\nThese things are not moving quickly enough\nyou can't get out of their way, but\n\n736\n00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.640\nthey are big enough and moving\nquickly enough that you can't pick up\n\n737\n00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.660\ninfrastructure and move it easily,\neven if it's virtual.\n\n738\n00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.430\nYou still gotta worry about that,\nbecause the carrying connections,\n\n739\n00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:58.945\nthe networks that connect you to where\nyou need to go, can be disrupted by that\n\n740\n00:36:58.945 --> 00:37:02.860\nstorm coming on shore across a five or\nsix hundred mile swath of territory.\n\n741\n00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.010\nBasically from the tip of Florida\nall the way up into Georgia.\n\n742\n00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.940\nWe get storms that are big enough they can\ncover the entire state at one time and\n\n743\n00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.920\nthey will move 40 miles\nan hour up the coast\n\n744\n00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:16.070\nwhich means in several hours they\nmove to three or four states.\n\n745\n00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:19.460\nIt's very hard for you to get out\nof the way of something like that.\n\n746\n00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:21.520\nI would say it's impossible, right?\n\n747\n00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.825\nSo as a result, you gotta be\nable to host in one location and\n\n748\n00:37:24.825 --> 00:37:27.690\nfail over thousands of miles\naway to another location.\n\n749\n00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.130\nBecause if you don't do that, chances\nare good that that disaster recovery\n\n750\n00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.900\ncapability is going to be\nimpacted by the same event.\n\n751\n00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.810\nAnd we just look at all the different\nthings that have happened around the world\n\n752\n00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:37.550\nover the last five,\n\n753\n00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:41.760\nten, 20 years with this thought process\nto learn from our mistakes, right?\n\n754\n00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:47.300\nIf you were in Fukushima when the reactor\nmelted down because of the Tsunami and\n\n755\n00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.740\nyou were anywhere in that general area\nafterwards, you know you were done,\n\n756\n00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:52.050\nthere was really nowhere to go.\n\n757\n00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.460\nBecause you had radiation,\nyou had water damage,\n\n758\n00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.110\nyou had all sorts of catastrophic\nthings happening and\n\n759\n00:37:57.110 --> 00:38:02.340\nit affected hundreds and thousands of\npeople, thousands of miles of territory.\n\n760\n00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:06.630\nSame thing in the Ukraine when,\nwhat's the nuclear power plant I'm\n\n761\n00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:08.250\nthinking of from years\nago that melted down?\n\n762\n00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:09.420\n>> You're talking about Chernobyl.\n\n763\n00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.140\n>> Sure.\nThank you very much.\n\n764\n00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.680\nSame thing with Chernobyl, right?\n\n765\n00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.460\nIt's the same idea.\n\n766\n00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.610\nIf you lived anywhere in that general\narea, you were affected by it for 10, 20,\n\n767\n00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:16.870\n30, 40, 100 miles around.\n\n768\n00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:20.280\nIt was a big deal, and so\nyou've got to think about these things.\n\n769\n00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.290\nWe don't think about nuclear power\nplants melting down every day.\n\n770\n00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.320\nThat's not the typical\ndisaster we deal with.\n\n771\n00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:29.050\nBut the reality is a storm can take out\nseveral thousand miles of territory\n\n772\n00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:32.570\nover a 24, 48 hour run,\ndepending on what kind of storm it is.\n\n773\n00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.970\nThe north, if you think about the living\nin the central part of the US,\n\n774\n00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:39.250\nin the northern, central part of the US,\nyou deal with snow storms and\n\n775\n00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:39.990\nice storms certainly.\n\n776\n00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.940\nIf you think about the central US and\n\n777\n00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.619\nthe plain states, you think about\ntornadoes and tornado alley.\n\n778\n00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.660\nA category five tornado\nripping through a 40,\n\n779\n00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:52.920\n50 miles swaff as it touches\nthe ground and then goes back again.\n\n780\n00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.640\nIn seconds can take out millions\nof dollars in infrastructure.\n\n781\n00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.560\nI mean, we're talking about 200 plus\nwinds and just tremendous damage.\n\n782\n00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.480\nSo, this is the kinda thing\nwe gotta worry about.\n\n783\n00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.050\nDo we have the existing\non sights solutions,\n\n784\n00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.648\ndo we have them geographically dispersed?\n\n785\n00:39:06.648 --> 00:39:09.540\nHave we pre-positioned\nour recovery options?\n\n786\n00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:12.550\nThese are things we would definitely\nwant to be concerned with and\n\n787\n00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:17.430\nwanna make sure that we are as CCSPs\nreally considering as part of the DR,\n\n788\n00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:20.240\nthe BCDR planning cycle\n>> Well Adam this has been\n\n789\n00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.600\nan enlightening episode.\n\n790\n00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.370\nWe've definitely gotta take a really good,\nfine look at disaster recovery and\n\n791\n00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:26.410\nbusiness continuity.\n\n792\n00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:31.703\nAnd thank you so much for helping us or\nremove the veil, as it were, on what those\n\n793\n00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:36.618\nexactly mean, so that we are able to\nengage each one of them accordingly.\n\n794\n00:39:36.618 --> 00:39:39.339\nThat being said I know you got some more\ninformation when it comes to this, so\n\n795\n00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:41.650\nit looks like we're headed\nto a part two in our future.\n\n796\n00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.950\nAnd for this one we'll go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n797\n00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:46.560\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.055\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode we are continuing on\n\n4\n00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:24.488\nwith our certified\nCloud Security professionals.\n\n5\n00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:26.209\nI got it right this time.\n\n6\n00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:27.856\n>> Building that anticipation.\n\n7\n00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:28.372\nI like that.\nThat was good.\n\n8\n00:00:28.372 --> 00:00:32.204\n>> A pregnant pause that we throw in there\nevery now and then before that build up.\n\n9\n00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:34.826\nBut joining us back in the studio\nagain today to help us out,\n\n10\n00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:37.711\nwe're doing a Part Two,\na little bit on that disaster recovery,\n\n11\n00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.450\nis our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.910\nAdam, welcome back, I know we've got\nsome odds and ends to cover for DR.\n\n13\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.580\n>> We do, so we're saying we're\ndoing Part Two of the disaster.\n\n14\n00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.930\nSo we're extending\nthe disaster into Part Two.\n\n15\n00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.650\nSo it was so good we brought it back for\na second run.\n\n16\n00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.600\nSo it's good to be back\nhere at Disaster Central.\n\n17\n00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.780\nSo let's talk a little bit more, as\nDaniel was just indicating we need to do,\n\n18\n00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.580\nabout disaster, disaster recovery,\nbusiness continuity, and the general\n\n19\n00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.160\nthought processes that we've been engaging\nin in our prior episode around this.\n\n20\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.488\nWe left off talking about,\n\n21\n00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:13.485\nright at the very end of the episode, the\nidea that we are worried about geography.\n\n22\n00:01:13.485 --> 00:01:16.955\nI made the point, I really stressed\nthe point that we should not recover\n\n23\n00:01:16.955 --> 00:01:19.495\ninto the same geography\nthat the disaster occurred.\n\n24\n00:01:19.495 --> 00:01:20.335\nAnd if we can avoid it,\n\n25\n00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:23.345\nbecause obviously there may be\nliabilities associated with that.\n\n26\n00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:25.975\nWe may not have the ability\nto provide power, long term,\n\n27\n00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:30.395\ncuz maybe power disruption has been, or\npower generation has been disrupted.\n\n28\n00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:35.030\nMaybe communication is down because cell\ntowers are down and landlines have been\n\n29\n00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.750\ncompromised because they have been\nknocked down off telephone poles or\n\n30\n00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.000\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n31\n00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.370\nDoes anybody still use landlines?\n\n32\n00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.830\nDoes anybody actually,\ndoes anybody have an analog phone anymore?\n\n33\n00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.364\nYou know I struggle with this sometimes.\n\n34\n00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:49.100\n[LAUGH] Because I talk to customers\na lot and I'm like cell phones and\n\n35\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.560\nVOIP systems are all great, right?\n\n36\n00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.150\nThink about the technology of the Cloud,\ntalk about real world for a minute, right?\n\n37\n00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.790\nThis is all good.\n\n38\n00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.000\nBut what do you do when there's\na disruptive event that takes out\n\n39\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.110\nthe service provider or takes out\nthe cell sites because, at that point,\n\n40\n00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.700\nyou've got nothing.\n\n41\n00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.430\nDo you guys have an actual land line?\n\n42\n00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.660\nDo you have a wired phone?\n\n43\n00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.310\nThey look at you like you're nuts,\nlike what is an analog phone?\n\n44\n00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.230\nWhat do you mean a land line, right?\n\n45\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.050\nWe don't have those things,\nand years ago that was normal.\n\n46\n00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.400\nYou walked into a business, you picked\nup a phone, it was an analog phone\n\n47\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.710\nthat was wired to an actual set of\ncables that ran on telephone poles.\n\n48\n00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.740\nToday we may or may not have that.\n\n49\n00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.210\nThose lines may be buried of course.\n\n50\n00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.490\nThey may not be above ground anymore, but\n\n51\n00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.380\nwe may still have analog\nsystems that are running.\n\n52\n00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.510\nWe traditionally now, more often than not,\nare using VoIP systems, and so\n\n53\n00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.530\nthis presents some very interesting\ndilemmas for us from a BCDR perspective.\n\n54\n00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.370\nHow do we bring back old technology that's\ntried and true, because we've gotten rid\n\n55\n00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.980\nof it because we thought it was so\narchaic, when the reality is we may\n\n56\n00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.970\nactually need that in the event that\nthere is a really bad disaster?\n\n57\n00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.260\nI can remember several years ago.\n\n58\n00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.830\nHow long have you lived in Florida?\n\n59\n00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.910\n>> I have lived here since 1985.\n\n60\n00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.076\n>> All right, so you've been here for\na, I can't do the math, but for\n\n61\n00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:54.650\na very long time.\n\n62\n00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.252\n>> 30 years.\n>> Yes, I could figure that out.\n\n63\n00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:56.782\nI was just being facetious.\n\n64\n00:02:56.782 --> 00:02:57.390\nSo you've been here for awhile.\n\n65\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.815\nBut you lived up here for\nthe most part, in this general area?\n\n66\n00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.720\n>> Yeah, well,\nI was born down in the Broward area but\n\n67\n00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.680\nwe moved up here [CROSSTALK].\n\n68\n00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.205\n>> Okay, so you were born down in Broward.\n\n69\n00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:11.390\nSo I don't know how long you\nwould have been down in Broward,\n\n70\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.230\nhow old you were when you moved.\n\n71\n00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.720\nBut we've had some significant storms,\nright, in South Florida in particular.\n\n72\n00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.680\nThey've certainly effected\nthis area as well.\n\n73\n00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.930\nBut not as often, not as much, and\n\n74\n00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.570\nmaybe not as disruptive,\ndepending on the kind of storm it was.\n\n75\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.702\n>> If you think of Andrew, [CROSSTALK]\n>> Well Andrew certainly would, sure,\n\n76\n00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:28.395\nit did tremendous damage down south,\ndidn't really come up here,\n\n77\n00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:30.130\ndidn't do much damage up here at all.\n\n78\n00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.110\n>> But I'm thinking, after Andrew,\nbut Andrew's a good example.\n\n79\n00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.930\nAnd I'm thinking not Andrew, I forget\nthe name of the storm that occurred.\n\n80\n00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.145\nIt was many years after Andrew, but\nit was in Miami in Broward, in Palm Beach.\n\n81\n00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:46.575\nExcuse me, didn't really come up here\nmuch, but and it wasn't like a huge,\n\n82\n00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:49.375\nhuge, huge storm that did mega damage, but\n\n83\n00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:52.905\nit was very catastrophic with regards\nto just taking out infrastructure.\n\n84\n00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:57.265\nAnd so, at the time when it came through,\nwhat happened was we had a lot of rain,\n\n85\n00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.680\na lot of wind actually more so\nthan anything else, and\n\n86\n00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.200\nwe lost power which tends to happen in\nmost storms, that's not a big deal.\n\n87\n00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.630\nWe lost power, so traffic lights are out,\nlights are out, all that kind of stuff.\n\n88\n00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.280\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe lost cell towers because, at the time,\n\n89\n00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.910\nprior to the storm happening, as is\nthe case even today, most cell towers have\n\n90\n00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.950\nbackup power but they have UPSs that\nrun on batteries for several hours.\n\n91\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.380\nThey're meant to go down for\na period of time,\n\n92\n00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.180\nand typically power is restored more often\nthan not, and the towers don't go offline.\n\n93\n00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.920\nWhile this power outage was extensive and\ntook days to recover from,\n\n94\n00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.980\nand as a result of that\nthe cell sites all went down.\n\n95\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.880\nSo within about three or\nfour hours of the storm going by,\n\n96\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.630\nwhen power stopped,\nall the cell sites went dead so\n\n97\n00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.368\nyou couldn't get a phone dial tone\non your cellphone if you tried.\n\n98\n00:04:43.368 --> 00:04:47.380\nThe landlines, if there were any, were\nall down because you had to have either\n\n99\n00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.120\nInternet access to use your phone in many\ncases, or because of the power outages,\n\n100\n00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.370\nthere was essentially no power to\nrun the repeater sites, and so\n\n101\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.550\neverything was down.\n\n102\n00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.920\nAnd on top of it,\n\n103\n00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.040\nyou couldn't get gas from the gas stations\ncuz there was no power to power the pumps.\n\n104\n00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.330\nAnd at the time, this actually changed\nin the state of Florida since then,\n\n105\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.050\nbefore this happened there was no law\nin the books that said you must have\n\n106\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.680\nemergency generation capabilities,\n\n107\n00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.080\npower generation capabilities at critical\ninfrastructure sites beyond just the UPS.\n\n108\n00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.960\nYou actually have to\nhave a backup generator.\n\n109\n00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.950\nNow most gas stations actually have\nsmall little backup generators, but\n\n110\n00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.960\nenough power to be able\nto power the pumps.\n\n111\n00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.600\nSo if there's power that you\nessentially don't have, you lose,\n\n112\n00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.760\nbecause the pumps are driven by power.\n\n113\n00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.795\nYou have to have electricity, in other\nwords, to get gas out of the the ground.\n\n114\n00:05:31.795 --> 00:05:35.885\nYou actually now can actually still\nget gas if gas is in the tanks\n\n115\n00:05:35.885 --> 00:05:37.405\nduring this event or after this event.\n\n116\n00:05:37.405 --> 00:05:39.785\nBecause people were essentially stuck.\n\n117\n00:05:39.785 --> 00:05:42.445\nBecause until they restored power,\nyou couldn't get gas.\n\n118\n00:05:42.445 --> 00:05:45.392\nAnd if you couldn't get gas,\nyou couldn't get to and from work.\n\n119\n00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:48.167\nSo this was like just this perfect storm\n\n120\n00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:51.365\ncascading errors all over\nthe place that nobody intended.\n\n121\n00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:55.277\nAnd so, BC/DR in these events\ncan be very chaotic is my point,\n\n122\n00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:58.837\nbecause we may not anticipate the fact\nthat power's gonna go out for\n\n123\n00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:01.407\nlong enough that our battery\nbackups are gonna wear down.\n\n124\n00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:04.387\nWe may anticipate we need power so\nwe have batteries and\n\n125\n00:06:04.387 --> 00:06:06.000\nthen we have a diesel generator.\n\n126\n00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.040\nWhat happens if you run the gas\ndown in the diesel generator, and\n\n127\n00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.615\nthe gas server is supposed to bring\nyou more gas, can't get through,\n\n128\n00:06:11.615 --> 00:06:15.560\ncuz there's no power, there's no\nstreetlights, there's no lights, and\n\n129\n00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.270\nall the roads are blocked because of\ndebris, and they haven't cleared the roads\n\n130\n00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.170\nyet, which also happens at\nthe end of these kinds of storms?\n\n131\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.340\nYou may be able to get power at the gas\nstation, but there may be no gas in\n\n132\n00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.500\nthe gas tanks, and as a result you\nmay not be able to get gas out.\n\n133\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.410\nAll this crazy things happen,\nand because of that,\n\n134\n00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.380\nit's very hard, sometimes,\nto anticipate what will occur.\n\n135\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.845\nSo we really have to think about\ngeographic preference and hosting and\n\n136\n00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:39.500\nlocation because this\nbecomes very important.\n\n137\n00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.720\nIf you live in Florida long and\n\n138\n00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.960\nif you know, you have to fill the tank\nup before the storm comes, right?\n\n139\n00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.720\nYou get the extra gas canisters,\ntypically fill those up and\n\n140\n00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.060\nyou make sure you freeze water bottles,\nyou do all the things you have to do, so\n\n141\n00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.080\nthat you have the capability\nto survive for\n\n142\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.920\na couple of days without going\nto the store if you need to.\n\n143\n00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.830\nAnd you can keep the food in the fridge\ncold, and all that kind of stuff.\n\n144\n00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.990\nAnd you always have an extra\npropane tank for the barbecue.\n\n145\n00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.280\nSo that,\nwhen you do have to cook all that food up,\n\n146\n00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.220\nyou can just have a big barbecue outside.\n\n147\n00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.501\nIt really sucks when it's the middle of\nthe summer, though, and it's 100 degrees,\n\n148\n00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:10.730\nyou have no power, and\nit's humid because of the storm, and\n\n149\n00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.280\nyou've got all that craziness going on.\n\n150\n00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.340\n>> Mosquitos are swarming.\n\n151\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.090\n>> Yeah and then you gotta fire\nup the grill on top of it.\n\n152\n00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.000\nAlthough I'll tell you, grill,\nwhen you do, if you get the frozen pizza,\n\n153\n00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.570\nall the stuff you gotta\ncook because you never,\n\n154\n00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.860\nyou normally don't eat cuz it's there for\nemergencies.\n\n155\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.879\nBut if you've got to clean the freezer\nout because everything's gonna go bad,\n\n156\n00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.014\nyou throw it all on the grill.\n\n157\n00:07:27.014 --> 00:07:28.802\nYou make those frozen pizzas on the grill.\n\n158\n00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:29.630\nThey come out so good.\n\n159\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.430\n>> Very crispy.\n\n160\n00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.340\n>> Yeah, really crispy.\n\n161\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.119\nBut you put them on there, a little foil,\nand you get the grill marks,\n\n162\n00:07:34.119 --> 00:07:35.890\nthey are awesome, it's really cool.\n\n163\n00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.702\nThat may be an awesome food truck idea,\nby the way.\n\n164\n00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:39.419\n>> That's right.\nHurricane pizza.\n\n165\n00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.750\n>> Hurricane pizza or something like that.\n\n166\n00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.758\nYou heard it here first, on ITPro TV.\n\n167\n00:07:43.758 --> 00:07:46.020\nI want 10% of any revenue.\n\n168\n00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.030\nAny of you go into that business, come up\nwith that and make it work, both of us,\n\n169\n00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.928\ntogether, 5% each, you and I.\n\n170\n00:07:51.928 --> 00:07:54.685\nWe want 10% of that revenue.\n\n171\n00:07:54.685 --> 00:07:56.076\nWe're gonna come looking for\nyou by the way.\n\n172\n00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:57.706\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n173\n00:07:57.706 --> 00:07:59.838\nthink about the fact that we have all\nthese issues we have to contend with.\n\n174\n00:07:59.838 --> 00:08:01.528\nWhat about failover architecture?\n\n175\n00:08:01.528 --> 00:08:05.142\nWhat about the concepts of active-active\nversus active-passive failover, right?\n\n176\n00:08:05.142 --> 00:08:08.770\nIf we think about active-active systems\nwe're thinking about systems that\n\n177\n00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.611\nare gonna have multiple controllers,\n\n178\n00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:14.700\nmultiple points of entry, multiple points\nof access in theory, but they're all on.\n\n179\n00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.600\nSo in other words, if one entry point,\n\n180\n00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.950\none access point, one controller fails,\nthe other's on in real time,\n\n181\n00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:23.736\nyou're connected to both, and you don't\nreally experience a loss of continuity.\n\n182\n00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.970\nBut in an active-passive system,\nwhile we have multiple points of entry,\n\n183\n00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.770\nmultiple points of access,\nmultiple controllers,\n\n184\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.000\nwe are only using only one set of\nthose at any one time actively.\n\n185\n00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.070\nAnd the other set is there,\n\n186\n00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.650\nbut it's essentially in what\nwe would call standby mode.\n\n187\n00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.370\nIt's waiting to be told it should turn on,\nand go active, but\n\n188\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.340\nit's not there, in the sense that it's not\nactively accepting inbound connections,\n\n189\n00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.560\nmanaging, and facilitating data access.\n\n190\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.310\nAnd there's a short interruption,\n\n191\n00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.980\na short period there where we\ndo what's called failing over.\n\n192\n00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.880\nWe bring up the standby node, and\nwe essentially make the passive node go\n\n193\n00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.610\nactive, and the active node goes offline,\nand we may fail back over time.\n\n194\n00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.980\nSo depending on the architecture we\ncreate in our storage networks and\n\n195\n00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.730\nin other areas,\nwe may have uninterrupted service,\n\n196\n00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.055\nwe may have a period of time where\nwe may have some interruption,\n\n197\n00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:09.870\nand we have to think about that and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n198\n00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.635\nSo active-passive versus active-active\ndata access on clusters, for instance,\n\n199\n00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:16.190\nin the storage arena.\n\n200\n00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.530\nWe can talk about this as being one of the\narchitectural elements we have to consider\n\n201\n00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:21.280\nwith BCDR.\n\n202\n00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.870\nBut this is something to\nreally think about, right?\n\n203\n00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.480\n[LAUGH] You think Ashley and\n\n204\n00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.500\nMegan should get a cut of\nthe Hurricane Pizza revenues as well.\n\n205\n00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.494\nYou know, you're right, I do apologize.\n\n206\n00:09:30.494 --> 00:09:31.750\nWe left them out.\n\n207\n00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.100\nWe would not be successful here\nat ITProTV without them and\n\n208\n00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.250\nthe people like them that are providing\nthe content to you behind the scenes,\n\n209\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.480\ncuz they actually make Daniel and\nI look good, right?\n\n210\n00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.230\nSo as a result, they will get\na cut of the revenue as well.\n\n211\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.569\nAnd we're still gonna come looking for\nyou, though, if you do this.\n\n212\n00:09:45.569 --> 00:09:46.102\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n213\n00:09:46.102 --> 00:09:46.950\nIt's a very good point.\n\n214\n00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:47.925\nKeep us honest, Peter.\n\n215\n00:09:47.925 --> 00:09:50.330\nThank you for making-\n>> Adam knows people that knows people.\n\n216\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.070\n>> I do, I know people that know people\nthat know people that know how to find\n\n217\n00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.510\nyour people, and then they'll have lunch\nat your Hurricane Pizza food truck.\n\n218\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.280\nThere we go.\n\n219\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.733\nSo we will make sure we spread\nthe revenue, the wealth, and\n\n220\n00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:02.840\nthe pizzas around.\n\n221\n00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.728\nYou could pay us in pizza, by the way,\nas opposed to money, if you like.\n\n222\n00:10:04.728 --> 00:10:05.309\n>> We do accept it.\n\n223\n00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:08.160\n>> We do accept pizza in lieu of cash.\n\n224\n00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.060\nSo that's a very good point to make,\nso thank you for keeping us honest.\n\n225\n00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.220\nSo when we think about\nfailover architecture,\n\n226\n00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.600\nthis is also an often overlooked\npart of the BCDR planning.\n\n227\n00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.460\nAgain, remember,\nas security professionals, right,\n\n228\n00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.810\nwe may not be the architects, we may\nsimply be the advisers, the facilitators,\n\n229\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.990\nright, the contributors to the plan in\nthe sense of ensuring it is focused on\n\n230\n00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.840\nthe right elements from\na security standpoint.\n\n231\n00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.160\nBut we may not actually be\nthe ones that build the plan.\n\n232\n00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.540\nWe may not be the ones that figure out\nthe active-active versus active-passive\n\n233\n00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.730\nelements of a failover architecture.\n\n234\n00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.360\nAnd that requires specialty knowledge,\n\n235\n00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.910\nit's not just something we\ncan learn how to do easily.\n\n236\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.600\nWe gotta know how to do that and\nreally think through that.\n\n237\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.440\nSo again, we come back to\nthis idea of partnering and\n\n238\n00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.690\nunderstanding how all those elements come\ntogether in order to facilitate the plan,\n\n239\n00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.300\nbut ultimately also test the plan, to\nensure that the plan will actually work,\n\n240\n00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.490\nin theory, anyway, work the way it should.\n\n241\n00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.420\nSo we have to be aware of these things.\n\n242\n00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.490\nWhen you were working in\nthe insurance bureau,\n\n243\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.940\nhow often would you guys\ntest your DR plans?\n\n244\n00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.480\n>> They would probably do\nit at least twice a year.\n\n245\n00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.390\n>> At least twice a year.\n\n246\n00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.980\nOkay, so,\nwas that because you had a mandate,\n\n247\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.190\nsome sort of policy that said\nwe have to do it that way?\n\n248\n00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.400\n>> I wanna say yes.\n\n249\n00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.953\nIf I remember correctly, we wanted\nto always make sure that anytime,\n\n250\n00:11:18.953 --> 00:11:21.198\na couple times a year, cut it off.\n\n251\n00:11:21.198 --> 00:11:25.935\nMake sure, just full failover and\nsee if everything works.\n\n252\n00:11:25.935 --> 00:11:28.030\n>> And hopefully be able to fail\nit back when it does, right?\n\n253\n00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.164\nSo I think I've shared this story in\nsome of our episodes outside of the CCSP\n\n254\n00:11:31.164 --> 00:11:34.499\nconversation we're having, but I'm pretty\nsure I talked about it in the CISSP\n\n255\n00:11:34.499 --> 00:11:37.984\nepisodes we've done in prior discussions,\nI'm pretty sure I shared this story,\n\n256\n00:11:37.984 --> 00:11:41.309\nI'll share it with you quickly here,\nbecause I think it's relevant as well.\n\n257\n00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:45.755\nSo I have several very large\ncustomers that this has happened to.\n\n258\n00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:49.437\nBut one I'm thinking of in particular\nthat engaged in essentially, Daniel,\n\n259\n00:11:49.437 --> 00:11:51.890\nwhat you were just describing,\na full failover BR or\n\n260\n00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.906\nBCDR test event where they would just pull\nthe plug, proverbially, literally, and\n\n261\n00:11:55.906 --> 00:11:59.308\nfail all the infrastructure over\naccording the test plan to the DR site or\n\n262\n00:11:59.308 --> 00:12:02.610\nwhatever it would've been, and\nthen they would fail back, right.\n\n263\n00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.120\nAt some point, you do it for a day,\nrun there, fail back, whatever you do.\n\n264\n00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.830\nBut, however you frame your\nfull interruption tests,\n\n265\n00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.610\nwhich is what we formally call it,\na full interruption test.\n\n266\n00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.380\nAnd so they went into their\nfull interruption test mode,\n\n267\n00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.780\nfailed over,\nthe failover went off into space, and\n\n268\n00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.360\ndid not wind up at the far\nside where it should have.\n\n269\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.810\nSo they said, oops, that's bad, let's fail\nback, and they couldn't fail back either.\n\n270\n00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.830\nSo essentially, they killed\neverything In the datacenter and\n\n271\n00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.410\nthey could not bring it back up,\nand they could not\n\n272\n00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:34.530\nfigure out how to get it to fail over to\nthe other side, to the recovery side.\n\n273\n00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.133\nAnd it turns out, this took about four\ndays, three to four days to figure out.\n\n274\n00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:42.415\nTurns out ultimately, without boring you\nwith all the gory details of what went on,\n\n275\n00:12:42.415 --> 00:12:46.457\nthey had wound up right before doing\nthe failover test through a change window,\n\n276\n00:12:46.457 --> 00:12:50.621\none of their normal maintenance windows,\nand wound up doing firmware upgrades to\n\n277\n00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:54.162\ntheir routing infrastructure,\nCisco infrastructure primarily.\n\n278\n00:12:54.162 --> 00:12:58.978\nAnd they had done a series of patches and\nupgrades and routing updates.\n\n279\n00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:02.995\nProblem is, and this is why we talk about\nrisk management and change management\n\n280\n00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:07.995\nbeing in lock step of one another, being\nessentially mirror images of one another.\n\n281\n00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:11.025\nBecause if you can't do one well,\nyou're not doing the other at all.\n\n282\n00:13:11.025 --> 00:13:12.305\nAnd that's really what's very important.\n\n283\n00:13:12.305 --> 00:13:15.301\nYou can do neither of them if\nyou're not doing both of them well.\n\n284\n00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:19.029\nAnd I stress this so often with customers\nand with students, because if you miss out\n\n285\n00:13:19.029 --> 00:13:21.957\non the idea of change management,\nas I'm about to illustrate for\n\n286\n00:13:21.957 --> 00:13:25.890\nyou in real time here with the story,\nyou blow risk management and you're done.\n\n287\n00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:28.400\nYou fail off into space and\nnothing comes back.\n\n288\n00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.680\nAnd so because they did not execute\nchange management properly,\n\n289\n00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:35.580\nthey wound up not updating the firmware\nin all the routing infrastructure and\n\n290\n00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.010\nthe switches to the right build level.\n\n291\n00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:41.220\nThey had left out one critical\npiece of infrastructure,\n\n292\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.660\nthis is always the case, right?\n\n293\n00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.040\nLike, a central core switch got patched,\nbut\n\n294\n00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.100\nit had been raised to\na different firmware level.\n\n295\n00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.040\nAnd because of the mismatch, they were not\nable to propagate their routing statements\n\n296\n00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.295\nand do the complicated failover things\nthat they needed to do to move traffic,\n\n297\n00:13:55.295 --> 00:13:58.055\nand essentially everything\njust died at that core switch.\n\n298\n00:13:58.055 --> 00:13:59.675\nNow, they didn't know that.\n\n299\n00:13:59.675 --> 00:14:02.875\nIt took almost four days of\ntroubleshooting, both with their internal\n\n300\n00:14:02.875 --> 00:14:07.145\ndisaster response efforts and\nemergency teams, and with the vendor.\n\n301\n00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:10.265\nAnd they had to essentially\nescalate this up the chain\n\n302\n00:14:10.265 --> 00:14:14.005\nto a fairly high level of technical\nresponse on the vendor side, and\n\n303\n00:14:14.005 --> 00:14:17.510\nit took the vendor and\nthem almost four days to figure this out.\n\n304\n00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.550\nAnd this became ultimately as they\nfigured it all out and unwound it,\n\n305\n00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.290\nsomething that the vendor had to\ndocument as a known issue going forward,\n\n306\n00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.450\nbecause they didn't realize\nthere would be this issue,\n\n307\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.642\nbecause they just hadn't tested this\nparticular confluence of events and\n\n308\n00:14:30.642 --> 00:14:35.220\nthis particular association of different\nfirmware levels and routing architecture\n\n309\n00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.470\nin this particular solution, and\nthey wound up having to deal with that.\n\n310\n00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.390\n>> That's a hard lesson\nto learn right there.\n\n311\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.020\n>> Well, thankfully, I mean, yes, there's\ngood and bad with everything, right.\n\n312\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:48.389\nSo we look at this dispassionately\nafter the fact objectively and we say,\n\n313\n00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:53.250\nyeah, sucks, wouldn't want to be there,\nhard lesson to learn.\n\n314\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:56.478\nBut you know what, I look at it and\nsay, yeah, all that's true, but\n\n315\n00:14:56.478 --> 00:15:00.206\nbetter learn it during testing where\nalthough it's a major disruption event,\n\n316\n00:15:00.206 --> 00:15:04.103\nyou're offline and things are bad, it's\nnot during a real disaster where you're\n\n317\n00:15:04.103 --> 00:15:08.200\nworried about the compounding effects of\nthe disaster on top of all this, right.\n\n318\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.161\nAt least you figured it out before\nthe real disaster happened, and so\n\n319\n00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.850\nthat the next time they did it,\nit all wound up working.\n\n320\n00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.490\nBut one missed patch on\none firmware upgrade\n\n321\n00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.490\nblew up over a million dollars\nof routing architecture.\n\n322\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.130\nI mean, just literally.\n\n323\n00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.350\nWe're talking about a several million\ndollar network, and it was all fine\n\n324\n00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.920\nwhen they fixed it, but it just rendered\nit basically, totally inoperable.\n\n325\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.520\nI mean,\nit was just like you had nothing there.\n\n326\n00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.535\nNothing would work.\n\n327\n00:15:30.535 --> 00:15:33.760\nYou could send stuff out, and it would\njust disappear, you would never know where\n\n328\n00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.609\nit went, and it would never come back,\nbecause it was never making it and\n\n329\n00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:38.860\npropagating out beyond\nthe core infrastructure.\n\n330\n00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.670\nBut they couldn't figure out why.\n\n331\n00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.470\nI mean, this is sometimes stuff that is so\n\n332\n00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:46.530\ncomplicated that you're never gonna figure\nout, unless you get the experts involved.\n\n333\n00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.520\nIn this case, the experts were involved,\nand it took them almost four days to\n\n334\n00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.450\nfigure it out, their own infrastructure,\nCisco's own infrastructure, stuff they own\n\n335\n00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.880\nthat they should know how to deal with,\nand it took them four days to diagnose.\n\n336\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.885\nSo it can be incredibly\ncomplicated sometimes, right?\n\n337\n00:15:58.885 --> 00:16:01.530\nSo you've got to really think\nthrough the logic of this.\n\n338\n00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.376\nI'd always rather find out in\ntesting than find out for real.\n\n339\n00:16:04.376 --> 00:16:06.894\nBut it is what it is sometimes, right?\n\n340\n00:16:06.894 --> 00:16:10.558\nAs security professionals,\nit may not be us, right?\n\n341\n00:16:10.558 --> 00:16:12.310\nI mean we're not the one who\nare standing there going, yeah but\n\n342\n00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.570\nI just, I told you if you just, if this\nwould have work, you just did it this way.\n\n343\n00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.460\nAnd you can never do that, because\nit's not your place to do that anyway.\n\n344\n00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.298\nBut the reality is,\n\n345\n00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:22.612\nas a security professional, we would\nhave no impact on that whole discussion.\n\n346\n00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:26.490\nIt wasn't anything that was done\nwrong from a security perspective\n\n347\n00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.040\nthat caused that to happen.\n\n348\n00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.550\nWith the exception of the fact that change\nmanagement was not properly applied\n\n349\n00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.490\nto the patching process so that we\nunderstood clearly what firmware updates\n\n350\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.200\nwere being done by device by version and\nwe could cross walk that to figure it out.\n\n351\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.200\nBecause that documentation didn't exist,\n\n352\n00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.390\nit was hard to ultimately\ndiagnose the problem.\n\n353\n00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.060\nWe eventually figured out what it was,\nbut it was very hard to get there.\n\n354\n00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.580\nSo we have to think about that, right,\n\n355\n00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.200\nthat can really cause\na bit of a challenge.\n\n356\n00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.000\nThat's when you want to be not on call and\non vacation,\n\n357\n00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.800\nsomewhere outside the country for\nlike two weeks with no way to reach me.\n\n358\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.550\nI'm climbing Mount Everest this week.\n\n359\n00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.610\nI'm not gonna be available for\nsupport calls right?\n\n360\n00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.970\nSo that's when you wanna do that.\n\n361\n00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.550\n>> And\nthe good news from that kind of thing,\n\n362\n00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.256\nit does happen right,\nthese big time disaster do occur.\n\n363\n00:17:06.256 --> 00:17:07.230\n>> It does all the time.\n\n364\n00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.196\n>> We, having the fortune of not being a\npart of it, get to stand on the shoulders\n\n365\n00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:14.002\nof those giants that figured\nout what the problem was,\n\n366\n00:17:14.002 --> 00:17:18.456\nthen go well we need to plan for that cuz\nmaybe we've got an infrastructure that's\n\n367\n00:17:18.456 --> 00:17:22.604\nvery similar to their's, and that's a\nproblem that we might run into, so now we\n\n368\n00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:27.153\ncan glean that information off of them and\nassimilated to our production environment.\n\n369\n00:17:27.153 --> 00:17:29.731\n>> We can and also equally important,\nwe get to laugh at them for being so\n\n370\n00:17:29.731 --> 00:17:32.620\nstupid that they let this happen in the\nfirst place cuz we're not the ones that\n\n371\n00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.214\nhave to fix it.\n\n372\n00:17:33.214 --> 00:17:34.658\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What were you thinking right?\n\n373\n00:17:34.658 --> 00:17:38.160\nSo we can do that as well which makes for\ngood times.\n\n374\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.960\nEverybody is happy ultimately\nat the end of the day.\n\n375\n00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.744\nYou fix the problem,\nI got to tell some good stories about you,\n\n376\n00:17:42.744 --> 00:17:43.690\nwe get to laugh about it.\n\n377\n00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.630\nEverybody wins.\n>> That's right.\n\n378\n00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.320\n>> So it's good.\n\n379\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.610\nSo data replication is\nalso very important.\n\n380\n00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.360\nWe got to be able to control the pathways\nas we talked about just with\n\n381\n00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.290\nthe story here.\n\n382\n00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:54.610\nWe have to understand how to propagate\ndata out and propagate it back.\n\n383\n00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:57.912\nWe have to understand the effects\non the value of multi pathing.\n\n384\n00:17:57.912 --> 00:18:00.830\nRedunding pathing will get you to and\nfrom a location so\n\n385\n00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.360\nif one fails we have\nanother path in place.\n\n386\n00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.350\nVery important.\n\n387\n00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.230\nWe have to replicate not just data,\nnot just connectivity, but functionality.\n\n388\n00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.080\nWe've gotta make sure that when we\nget to the other side the application\n\n389\n00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.070\nworkloads are available.\n\n390\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.950\nWe have to make sure\nthe storage is available.\n\n391\n00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.810\nWe have to make sure\nthe routing is available.\n\n392\n00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.740\nWe have to make sure\nthe bandwidth is available.\n\n393\n00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.250\nWe have to make sure all\nthe services are available.\n\n394\n00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.010\nThis is why I said when we talked about\nthis in a prior episode, that if we were\n\n395\n00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.930\nto steal a snapshot essentially of\na system without having access to the data\n\n396\n00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:32.061\ndrives and all the mount points that\nare necessary to run that snapshot,\n\n397\n00:18:32.061 --> 00:18:34.427\nsnapshots essentially irrelevant.\n\n398\n00:18:34.427 --> 00:18:38.720\nIt's a bunch of data sitting in a file but\nit doesn’t connect to anything that can\n\n399\n00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.490\nactually to be used to run that system and\nre-animate and inflate it.\n\n400\n00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.160\nAnd as a result it’s important but\n\n401\n00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.990\nit's meaningless at the same time,\nbecause without the data back end,\n\n402\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.250\nright, to connect you in the storage\narray, that snapshots irrelevant.\n\n403\n00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.710\nIt's totally useless to us.\n\n404\n00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.830\nSo we need to understand that\nfunctionality replication\n\n405\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:00.910\nhas to be a primary focus and\nconcern of BCDR,\n\n406\n00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:03.700\nit cant just be yeah I've got path,\nor I've got tone.\n\n407\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.570\nYeah you've got tone you've got path but\nwhat are you doing with it?\n\n408\n00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.930\nCan I spin up an application?\n\n409\n00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.170\nCan I run exchange?\n\n410\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:10.450\nDo I have storage?\n\n411\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.840\nCan I access email?\n\n412\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.020\nCan I file and print if necessary?\n\n413\n00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.790\nCan I use VOIP if necessary?\n\n414\n00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.440\nIf that gateway,\nif that digital PBX doesn't exist,\n\n415\n00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.890\nif our H323 gateways are not there and\ni cant control audio and\n\n416\n00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.560\nvideo coming and\ngoing to my system I got nothing.\n\n417\n00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.340\nBecause that's what I need,\nthat's the functionality I expect.\n\n418\n00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.800\nSo it's not enough just to fail over,\n\n419\n00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.610\nwe have to fail over with an anticipation\nof functionality being available.\n\n420\n00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:36.410\nAnd so\nwe again come back to this idea of BIA,\n\n421\n00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.970\ncome back to the idea of\nunderstanding what's required, and\n\n422\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.850\nunderstanding what is must\nhave versus nice to have.\n\n423\n00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:45.530\nNeed to have, nice to have\nare the way I often frame that.\n\n424\n00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.260\nFunctional, verses\nnonfunctional requirements.\n\n425\n00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.660\nFunction requirements are must haves,\ngotta have them no matter what.\n\n426\n00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.390\nNonfunction requirements, nice to have,\nit would be great if I have that, but\n\n427\n00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.860\nI'll survive if I don't.\n\n428\n00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.940\nWe gotta make sure we nail\nthe functional requirements,\n\n429\n00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.610\nwe gotta make sure we nail\nthe must haves when we fail over.\n\n430\n00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.790\nIf we don't get that functionality,\n\n431\n00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.810\nif we don't have that replication\ntaking place of the environment that\n\n432\n00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:11.020\nis essentially gonna operate the same way,\nwe haven't done our job.\n\n433\n00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.200\nWe have not executed BCDR properly.\n\n434\n00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.420\nAs security professionals, we could\nsay yeah, in theory, the border and\n\n435\n00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.860\nthe enclave is established,\nwe're good, but\n\n436\n00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.260\nif there's nothing in there, then\nunfortunately we've done our piece, but\n\n437\n00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.060\nthe rest of it's not\nworking the right way.\n\n438\n00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.860\nWe may make one hell of a secure system,\n\n439\n00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.600\nbut there may be no functionality to\nactually use the system with is my point.\n\n440\n00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.500\nAnd one without the other, essentially it\njust unfortunately doesn't do the job.\n\n441\n00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.980\nI can create a really secure\nsystem that nobody can use, but\n\n442\n00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.320\nthen nobody's going to actually\nbe able to produce anything.\n\n443\n00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.130\nI may be able to create an insecure\nsystem a lot of people can use.\n\n444\n00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:43.550\nThat's also not a good outcome.\n\n445\n00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.990\nIn need the proper level of security along\nwith the proper level of functionality,\n\n446\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.390\nthat's where we ultimately went.\n\n447\n00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.950\nWe wanna see those circles\nintersect in other words, right?\n\n448\n00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:53.780\nAnd functionality and\nsecurity should essentially create\n\n449\n00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.990\na common area between the two,\nat least in theory anyway.\n\n450\n00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.050\nOn paper that's what we like to see.\n\n451\n00:20:58.050 --> 00:20:59.440\nSo then, planning, preparation,\n\n452\n00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.580\nprovisioning, all these\nthings are very important.\n\n453\n00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:05.660\nWe've got to figure out how to ensure\nthat we have the appropriate tools,\n\n454\n00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.130\nthe appropriate knowledge,\nthe appropriate people,\n\n455\n00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.080\nthe appropriate resources to do the job.\n\n456\n00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.760\nI've had this happen before when we\ngo through documenting the BCDR plan.\n\n457\n00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.570\nWhat the steps are as I mentioned.\n\n458\n00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.090\nYou know, the account number,\nthe user name, the password,\n\n459\n00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.920\nall that should be there.\n\n460\n00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.910\nI've also seen where we have call trees.\n\n461\n00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:25.630\nAnd you may or\nmay not be familiar with the concept, but\n\n462\n00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:29.010\nessentially a contact list as what\nwe call a call tree commonly.\n\n463\n00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.170\nAnd we go down that looking for\npeople, essentially,\n\n464\n00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.350\nthat are supposed to be on call at certain\npoints in time to do certain things.\n\n465\n00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.730\nIf you don't update the data in that\nthing, people change their names, people\n\n466\n00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.230\nchange their numbers, they get married,\nthey move, they're in different roles.\n\n467\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.590\nIf you're not updating that stuff and\nyou have a disaster,\n\n468\n00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.320\nyou dust that list off and start calling\ndown that list, and I've had it happen,\n\n469\n00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.250\nfive, six, seven names and numbers in\nthere and I'm not getting anybody?\n\n470\n00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:55.140\nThat's not just, you don't want to be on\nthe receiving end of those phone calls.\n\n471\n00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.460\nBecause the problem is,\n\n472\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:00.470\nyou can't get the activities kicked\noff that you need to respond.\n\n473\n00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.430\nAnd time is your enemy when\nyou're talking about a disaster.\n\n474\n00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.660\nThe more it takes for\nyou to get the response mechanisms up and\n\n475\n00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:09.400\nrunning and\nactively participating in recovery,\n\n476\n00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.270\nthe longer that disaster is going\nto linger, the more damage it does.\n\n477\n00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:15.650\nI mean that's just\nthe reality of the world.\n\n478\n00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.210\nthe longer something goes\nunanswered as a challenge,\n\n479\n00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.810\nthe worse the impact of it over time.\n\n480\n00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:21.890\nSo we have to think about that,\n\n481\n00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:25.250\nwe have to really focus on having\nthe most up to date information.\n\n482\n00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.370\nAnd it happens, it can happen\nto any of us without realizing.\n\n483\n00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.440\nPeople walk around today with those lists\na lot of times on their cell phones.\n\n484\n00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.880\nAnd if they don't sync the lists back,\n\n485\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.870\nright, to the most recent copy,\nyou may have inaccurate information.\n\n486\n00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.110\nAnd the time to figure that out,\nis not when the system is down,\n\n487\n00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:42.200\nand you can't get into SharePoint to find\nit, or get into Websphere to find it.\n\n488\n00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.700\nThe time is before that happens,\n\n489\n00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.922\nto make sure you have the most\nup to date information.\n\n490\n00:22:45.922 --> 00:22:51.700\nWe've got administrative function in my\norganization that is keeping track of,\n\n491\n00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:52.590\nwe've got about 40 or 50 employees,\n\n492\n00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.370\nyou know most new horizons relatively\nsmall not very big on average.\n\n493\n00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:59.500\nAnd we've got about 40 or 50 people\nthat work for us as team members in\n\n494\n00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.690\nthe South Florida and\nCaribbean offices that im associated with.\n\n495\n00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.130\nAnd we have one of our front desk\npeople in any of the centers\n\n496\n00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.810\nessentially is tasked with\nupdating our master call list.\n\n497\n00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:12.040\nNot just for business continuity and\ndisaster recover but in general Just so\n\n498\n00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.520\nyou can get a hold of everybody.\n\n499\n00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:17.300\nYou know we have in some cases in some\nmonths, five or six updates to that list.\n\n500\n00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.410\nI mean I'm constantly wondering, how often\ndo people change their phone numbers,\n\n501\n00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.140\nhow often are we hiring people,\nhow often are people changing roles.\n\n502\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.575\nBut I see five or six or\nseven updates go out.\n\n503\n00:23:25.575 --> 00:23:28.355\nSometimes in a given\nmonth around that list.\n\n504\n00:23:28.355 --> 00:23:31.325\nThankfully we have somebody keeping track\nof all that, cuz I'll tell you, I would\n\n505\n00:23:31.325 --> 00:23:34.895\nnever find anybody if it wasn't for that\nlist, cuz I would call the main number and\n\n506\n00:23:34.895 --> 00:23:38.840\njust essentially be hey, I need so and so\ncuz I've lost track of their phone number\n\n507\n00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.910\nfive or six times ago I just\ndon't know what it is anymore.\n\n508\n00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.970\nAnd then we went to DID recently,\nDirect Inbound Dial, and so\n\n509\n00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:49.090\nwe used to have one number you would call\nand the switchboard would put you through.\n\n510\n00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.450\nNow you can actually dial\ndirect which makes sense.\n\n511\n00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.702\nBut now I've got to keep track of like 20\nnumbers from 20 different people instead\n\n512\n00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:55.297\nof one number.\n\n513\n00:23:55.297 --> 00:23:58.257\nSo I just gave up, I mean if I want\nsomebody I call the main number, and\n\n514\n00:23:58.257 --> 00:24:00.911\nI say can I please be put through to them,\nor I'll email them,\n\n515\n00:24:00.911 --> 00:24:02.513\nbecause then they'll call me back.\n\n516\n00:24:02.513 --> 00:24:05.075\n>> Adam should we be doing any\nkind of readiness drills for\n\n517\n00:24:05.075 --> 00:24:06.196\nthings of that nature?\n\n518\n00:24:06.196 --> 00:24:09.410\nTo see whether or\nnot what we're doing is actually working.\n\n519\n00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.529\nI guess it's [CROSSTALK]\n>> Absolutely, no we should be.\n\n520\n00:24:11.529 --> 00:24:14.879\nAnd we have different kinds of testing\nthat we engage in, you mentioned the full\n\n521\n00:24:14.879 --> 00:24:18.420\ninterruption test when you told me your\nstory about how you guys would do it.\n\n522\n00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.205\nWe should do different kinds of tests.\n\n523\n00:24:20.205 --> 00:24:21.125\nThere's not doubt about it.\n\n524\n00:24:21.125 --> 00:24:23.621\nWe may do a structured walk through.\n\n525\n00:24:23.621 --> 00:24:27.205\nWe may do a simulation,\nmay do a table top exercises.\n\n526\n00:24:27.205 --> 00:24:28.615\nMay do a partial interruption.\n\n527\n00:24:28.615 --> 00:24:29.925\nMay do a full interruption.\n\n528\n00:24:29.925 --> 00:24:32.940\nThere's all these different grades\nof testing we talk about with BCDR,\n\n529\n00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.210\nformally the names are not as important,\nalthough it's probably good for you,\n\n530\n00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.870\nthat was sense of the kind of test.\n\n531\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:40.160\nBut today it point to what\nreally is important, so\n\n532\n00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.040\nwe know that we should be testing and\ntesting a different levels of the plan for\n\n533\n00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.070\ndifferent outcomes, at least once,\nmaybe twice a year.\n\n534\n00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:50.780\nI have customers to do this quarterly,\nI have customers like you that we're doing\n\n535\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.620\nit semi annually, a couple times a year,\nI have customers do it once a year.\n\n536\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:57.180\nThankfully, I have very few customers\nthat don't do it at all, but\n\n537\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.810\nthere are some that just don't get it and\ndon't feel it's appropriate.\n\n538\n00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:00.970\nBut you have to do that.\n\n539\n00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.060\nIt's very important.\n\n540\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.450\nWe can't expect people to\nrespond appropriately,\n\n541\n00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:07.770\nif we don't give them the opportunity\nto figure out what appropriate is.\n\n542\n00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.940\nIs what I will tell customers,\nand so we gotta do that.\n\n543\n00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.220\nWe wanna return to normal,\nas quickly as possible, and test it.\n\n544\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.530\nAnd validating that will\nhelp us to do that.\n\n545\n00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.810\nIt shakes the kinks out of the system,\nessentially, right?\n\n546\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.540\nIt makes sure that we\nknow what we're doing.\n\n547\n00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.300\nThe plan should be vetted as well,\nby the way.\n\n548\n00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.950\nWe should do what's called a PIR,\n\n549\n00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:26.160\npost implementation review in\nproject management language.\n\n550\n00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:28.120\nOr a lessons learned, or a post mortem,\n\n551\n00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.260\nit's referred to different ways depending\non whose methodology you follow.\n\n552\n00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:34.160\nBut ultimately after that test,\n\n553\n00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.870\nwe should have a series of notes\nabout things that worked well.\n\n554\n00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.410\nYeah, everybody was on the calls,\nwe had the updated information, called,\n\n555\n00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.830\neverybody answered, jumped into action,\ndid what they were supposed to do.\n\n556\n00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.470\nOn things that may not have worked well.\n\n557\n00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:50.900\nWe want to go to this recovery system and\nthe user and password were wrong, right?\n\n558\n00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.530\nSomebody locked the account\nout we've got to reset it.\n\n559\n00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.470\nSo we got to note that we got go back and\nfix that or whatever it is.\n\n560\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.820\nAnd so we got to have all that and cycle\nthat input back into the plan, updating\n\n561\n00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:05.150\nthe plan, so at the next time we use it,\nit will hopefully actually go much better.\n\n562\n00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:08.190\nSo we have to take advantage of those\nopportunities, there's no doubt about it.\n\n563\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.730\nThe scope of the plan, in terms of\nthe BCDR plan, should actually encompass,\n\n564\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:16.010\nany and everything that the systems\nthat we are relying on,\n\n565\n00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.090\nbased on the BIA, are gonna require.\n\n566\n00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:21.270\nSo clearly defined roles,\nas we talked about has to be there.\n\n567\n00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.190\nRisk assessment has to be involved.\n\n568\n00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:27.530\nClassification, policy, awareness,\ntraining, backup systems, right?\n\n569\n00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:28.310\nWhere's the data?\n\n570\n00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:29.350\nWhere are the people?\n\n571\n00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.920\nWhat are the functionalities that we need.\n\n572\n00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.600\nThe nice to haves.\n\n573\n00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:34.250\nThe need to haves and\nthen all that stuff should be in the plan.\n\n574\n00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.010\nIf we don't find that all in\nthe plan then we've got holes and\n\n575\n00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.940\nreally have to understand\nhow to patch them.\n\n576\n00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.850\nOver time it becomes very important.\n\n577\n00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.120\nWe talked about requirements gathering\nof the validation of those requirements\n\n578\n00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.250\nagainst the plan,\n\n579\n00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.720\nmake sure we look at the requirements\nfrom the business prospective.\n\n580\n00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.400\nStake holder,\nsenior management has to be vetted.\n\n581\n00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.690\nWe have to go through them and understand\nwhat their perception, their needs are,\n\n582\n00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.500\nwe have to talk to individual users in\ncharge of mission critical systems.\n\n583\n00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.560\nMake sure we understand what they have\na need on the operational tactical side\n\n584\n00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.380\nto accomplish, right.\n\n585\n00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.380\nSo for instance,\nwhen you look at DR planning and\n\n586\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.180\nBCDR planning in the healthcare industry,\nand specifically in hospitals.\n\n587\n00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.860\nOne of the most critical elements,\nyou would think there's a lot of critical\n\n588\n00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:18.860\nstuff, we're talking about life safety\nissues, people in critical care units,\n\n589\n00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:23.030\nhave to be essentially have power\nregardless cuz you're on a heart monitor\n\n590\n00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.130\nor you're on a dialysis machine or\n\n591\n00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:29.190\nyou're on a ventilator that's been\nbreathing for you automatically.\n\n592\n00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.515\nIf we lose power, people die.\n\n593\n00:27:31.515 --> 00:27:34.145\nThat's just the brutal\nreality in these systems.\n\n594\n00:27:34.145 --> 00:27:37.555\nWe have manual intervention- we can use\nan airbag and breathe for somebody.\n\n595\n00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:40.875\nBut the problem is you've got to have\na human being standing there, compressing\n\n596\n00:27:40.875 --> 00:27:45.022\na bag pushing air into someone's lungs\n24 hours a day, if there's not a system\n\n597\n00:27:45.022 --> 00:27:49.232\nthat's doing that, and that can or\ncannot work depending on a lot of factors.\n\n598\n00:27:49.232 --> 00:27:51.282\nSo it's not a perfect system.\n\n599\n00:27:51.282 --> 00:27:53.042\nSo when we think about those\nthings you would think, well,\n\n600\n00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:54.052\npower is the most important thing.\n\n601\n00:27:54.052 --> 00:27:54.982\nWe've got to have power.\n\n602\n00:27:54.982 --> 00:27:58.606\nSo yeah, absolutely, power's important,\nbut power is not the number one issue.\n\n603\n00:27:58.606 --> 00:28:02.306\nIf you don't have power, you have backup\ngenerators, you have battery, whatever.\n\n604\n00:28:02.306 --> 00:28:05.096\nYou have a period of time a window\nwhere you can make things work.\n\n605\n00:28:05.096 --> 00:28:06.676\nYou stop operating, right.\n\n606\n00:28:06.676 --> 00:28:10.763\nYou start checking vitals and\nvital statistics things manually, right.\n\n607\n00:28:10.763 --> 00:28:12.743\nAnd we keep a much closer eye on patients,\nbut\n\n608\n00:28:12.743 --> 00:28:15.163\nwe could probably manage\nthrough a lot of that.\n\n609\n00:28:15.163 --> 00:28:17.543\nBut the bigger issue,\nis actually clean water.\n\n610\n00:28:17.543 --> 00:28:19.453\nIf you don't have clean water and\n\n611\n00:28:19.453 --> 00:28:22.393\naccess to clean water,\nyou can't do infection control.\n\n612\n00:28:22.393 --> 00:28:25.936\nForget about losing power if you can't\ndo infection control on a hospital.\n\n613\n00:28:25.936 --> 00:28:30.456\nYou have to evacuate the premises\nimmediately, because essentially the germs\n\n614\n00:28:30.456 --> 00:28:33.536\nare gonna take over and you're gonna start\nkilling people because of an infections.\n\n615\n00:28:33.536 --> 00:28:37.676\nSo when we look at these disruptiveness\nand the events in this particular sector.\n\n616\n00:28:37.676 --> 00:28:40.096\nIs actually lack of ability or\n\n617\n00:28:40.096 --> 00:28:45.270\nlack of access to clean water that also we\ndecides wether you stay on site or leave.\n\n618\n00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.240\nNot the loss of power in many cases.\n\n619\n00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.560\nCuz again, we can offset that with\ngenerators and today various things,\n\n620\n00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.420\nright, in main cities.\n\n621\n00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.592\nI'm not talking about\na remote village somewhere,\n\n622\n00:28:54.592 --> 00:28:58.380\nyou are the middle of a rainforest\nwhere there's no power to begin with.\n\n623\n00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.770\nI'm talking about in the middle of\na City with developed infrastructure.\n\n624\n00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.150\nYou lose power, you have a backup\ngenerator and it essentially powers on.\n\n625\n00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.960\nYou constrain the use of that\npower to mission critical systems,\n\n626\n00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.380\nso you route the power\nwhere it needs to be.\n\n627\n00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:14.400\nIf you can't pump clean water out of\nthe wells into the system to facilitate\n\n628\n00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.040\ninfection control, you gotta shut down\nthat hospital and evacuate everybody.\n\n629\n00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.800\nOtherwise, you're gonna just literally,\nyou're gonna have people start\n\n630\n00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.280\ngetting infections that can kill\nthem in hours in some cases.\n\n631\n00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.820\nSo it's a really big deal and we have to\nthink about how that kind of system would\n\n632\n00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:32.550\naffect us and ultimately what may happen\nwith regards to a cloud solution.\n\n633\n00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.640\nMay not be as catastrophic.\n\n634\n00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.700\nWe're not talking about\naccess to clean to water.\n\n635\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.140\nStopping cloud services from happening,\nbut at the same time there may be mission\n\n636\n00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.680\ncritical issues like that, that the cloud\nprovider has to contend with and\n\n637\n00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.630\nif they can't provide that service.\n\n638\n00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.660\nThey may have to shut down, or\nreroute you to a system that will.\n\n639\n00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.480\nAnd we may not be aware of what\nthose are by the way, right.\n\n640\n00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:53.700\nBecause we may not have\nvisibility into that.\n\n641\n00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.730\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n642\n00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:59.620\nWe have to think through the analysis\nphase, the design phase of BCDR planning.\n\n643\n00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.210\nThe requirements gathering, the analysis,\nthe design, the risk assessment.\n\n644\n00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.880\nThese are all phases that we have\nto gather information around and\n\n645\n00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.740\nplan through the implementation phase.\n\n646\n00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.100\n>> You make me think of War Games again.\n\n647\n00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:12.110\nAt the very beginning of the movie,\n\n648\n00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.780\nthey got the guys going into the missile\nsilos and then they test them.\n\n649\n00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.040\nThey say, this is a severe event.\n\n650\n00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.920\nWe have to fire off the nuclear missiles.\n\n651\n00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.590\nAnd one guy will not turn his missile\nkey and fire the missiles off.\n\n652\n00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:27.660\nSo they replace the entire structure with\nan automated system that will do it when\n\n653\n00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.870\nthey want it to instead of relying\non a human that wouldn't followers.\n\n654\n00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:35.520\n>> Right, so those are kind of\nthings we got to think about because\n\n655\n00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.980\nit is the weakest link in the chain or\n\n656\n00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.340\nthe single point of failure,\nyou can refer to it either way.\n\n657\n00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:41.360\nThat understressed typically, right.\n\n658\n00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.573\nActually, breaks down and that's\nmore often than not what we find and\n\n659\n00:30:44.573 --> 00:30:47.677\nwhat we have to prove and test for\nin order to validate ultimately and\n\n660\n00:30:47.677 --> 00:30:50.940\nfigure out how to mitigate or\nhow to risk manage out of the system.\n\n661\n00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:56.630\nSo we have to worry about not just the\nrisk assessment but the implementation.\n\n662\n00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:57.720\nHow's that phase gonna go?\n\n663\n00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.570\nHow are we gonna build it,\nhow are we going to run it?\n\n664\n00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.420\nWe have to worry about testing and\nacceptance, and\n\n665\n00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.800\nultimately figure out how it's gonna\nwork into production, and in realtime,\n\n666\n00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.870\nif it really will roll and do the things\nit needs to do and if it doesn't.\n\n667\n00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.850\nWell we have to figure that out,\nand if it does,\n\n668\n00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:15.130\nwe've got to maintain stability to ensure\nthat it will continue to work that way and\n\n669\n00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:18.060\npropagate that down through\nthe system over time.\n\n670\n00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:21.340\nSo these are the main concerns, the main\nerrors, the main focal points that we\n\n671\n00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.420\nhave to be thinking about with regards to\nCloud data security, infrastructure and\n\n672\n00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:29.910\ninfrastructure related security in that\nplatform, risk assessment, risk management\n\n673\n00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:33.150\nand of course business continuity\ndisaster recovery on top of all that,\n\n674\n00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.980\nas we intended to build layer upon layer\nof our Cloud knowledge as we pursue\n\n675\n00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.210\nthe information from the knowledge,\nyou need competency CSPs.\n\n676\n00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:44.070\n>> And a lot of complexity goes into\ncreating that disaster recovery, and\n\n677\n00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:48.030\nthat business continuity plan, and\nthen actually testing it, implementing it,\n\n678\n00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:50.770\nmaking sure it's actually where you're\ngonna have a set of standards to say,\n\n679\n00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.988\nwell did it work,\nI need to be able to measure that.\n\n680\n00:31:53.988 --> 00:31:58.635\nOkay did the Email systems come back on,\ndid the power backups actually work?\n\n681\n00:31:58.635 --> 00:32:00.255\nDid all these things do\nwhat we needed them to do?\n\n682\n00:32:00.255 --> 00:32:03.445\nThat's what this testing is all about,\nand that's why you gotta really take,\n\n683\n00:32:03.445 --> 00:32:07.655\nlike you said, that holistically,\nevery aspect of your business\n\n684\n00:32:07.655 --> 00:32:11.035\nneeds to be accounted for and put into\nplay when it comes to disaster recovery.\n\n685\n00:32:11.035 --> 00:32:12.570\nBecause you never know,\n\n686\n00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:15.840\nwhat is gonna be the linchpin that\nkeeps it all from not working?\n\n687\n00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.430\nMaybe it's a single switch that didn't\nget a firmware update, and now you're.\n\n688\n00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.070\n>> Four days.\n\n689\n00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:22.910\n>> Down with a multi-million dollar\nsystem that's doing nothing for you.\n\n690\n00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.780\nSo you gotta try to find every angle,\nand just hit it from every angle.\n\n691\n00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:29.650\nAdam, thanks so much for dropping by and\n\n692\n00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.630\nreally, again removing\nthe veil from our eyes.\n\n693\n00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:35.590\nSo that we would go and see and\nsay, this is kind of important for\n\n694\n00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:41.320\nus to take a look at and we really need\nto come at it with an eye of focus and\n\n695\n00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.800\ninsight and I appreciate yours.\n\n696\n00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.380\nThat's right, eyes wide open.\n\n697\n00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.840\nAgain thanks for dropping and\nwe thank you guys for watching.\n\n698\n00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.460\nHopefully you enjoyed this episode.\n\n699\n00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.970\nSigning off for\nITPrOTV I've been your host Daniel Lowery.\n\n700\n00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.156\n>> I'm newly found knowledge and\naware, Adam Gordon.\n\n701\n00:32:55.156 --> 00:32:56.336\nAnd we'll see you next time.\n\n702\n00:32:56.336 --> 00:32:58.199\n>> Take care, everybody.\n\n703\n00:32:58.199 --> 00:33:04.585\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

another exciting\nepisode of IT Pro TV.\n\n4\n00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.940\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and\nin today's episode, we are continuing\n\n5\n00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.520\nforward with our Certified Cloud\nSecurity Professional series.\n\n6\n00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.030\nJoining us back in the show\ntoday is our good friend and\n\n7\n00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.220\nmentor in every endeavor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.020\nAdam, welcome back to the show,\nsir, how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.460\n>> Also, Hurricane Pizza entrepreneur.\n\n10\n00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.120\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n11\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.910\nGot that as well.\n\n12\n00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.720\n>> Partner in crime.\n\n13\n00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.508\n>> Partner in crime.\n\n14\n00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:39.212\n[LAUGH] I am doing well, I'm doing well,\nhopefully everybody out there is also.\n\n15\n00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:43.310\nSo we're gonna continue our discussions,\nas exciting as they always are,\n\n16\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.680\nwith regards to a little bit\nof a switch in focus for\n\n17\n00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.710\nthis particular set of episodes, with\nregards to Cloud application security.\n\n18\n00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.520\nWe talked a lot up until now,\nabout the building blocks,\n\n19\n00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.880\nabout the management, about the risk,\nabout the data, about the infrastructure.\n\n20\n00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.090\nWanna talk now about the applications that\nrun on top of the Cloud or in the Cloud or\n\n21\n00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.450\nthrough the Cloud, and\nthe need for training and\n\n22\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.150\nawareness in application security.\n\n23\n00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.260\nThe need for secure development\nmethodologies, SDLCs with\n\n24\n00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.585\nregards to system and software development\nlife cycles that are focused on security.\n\n25\n00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:17.376\nWe'll talk about those, so secure system\ndevelopment, secure software development,\n\n26\n00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:20.362\nSSDLC, as we often talk about\nin systems engineering.\n\n27\n00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:22.330\nAnd we're gonna talk, in general,\n\n28\n00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.600\nabout the ways in which we should\nprovide guidance to CCSPs.\n\n29\n00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.020\nProvide oversight and provide capabilities\nto the application development\n\n30\n00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.310\nactivities and the application development\nfunction in the Cloud organization,\n\n31\n00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.665\nto ensure that to the best of their and\nour joint abilities, that we are engaging\n\n32\n00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:43.725\nin secure and monitored best practices\nwith regards to software design,\n\n33\n00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:47.721\nsoftware implementation, software testing,\nsoftware maintenance, software management.\n\n34\n00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:50.775\nThe entire life cycle with regards\nto application development\n\n35\n00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:54.095\nshould be vetted and ultimately\nmanaged with an eye towards security.\n\n36\n00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:55.935\nAnd we'll be talking\nabout those things and\n\n37\n00:01:55.935 --> 00:01:57.755\nhow hopefully that's\ngonna work a little bit.\n\n38\n00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:01.680\nSo when we begin our conversations or\nstart out talking about stuff\n\n39\n00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.510\nin this area, we have to think about the\nfact that, really in many respects as is\n\n40\n00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.240\nalways the case, probably without\nexception everywhere we look.\n\n41\n00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.840\nWe have to weigh the benefits,\nthe cost, the benefit and\n\n42\n00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.405\nthe value that we're getting out\nof this kind of thought process or\n\n43\n00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.005\nan endeavor against the challenges,\nthe complexities, and\n\n44\n00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:19.315\nthe risks that we may\nundertake in order to do so.\n\n45\n00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:24.665\nAnd so benefit, cost benefit analysis, or\ncost benefit assessment is gonna be very,\n\n46\n00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:29.225\nvery important to our understanding of how\nto engage in the proper level of security.\n\n47\n00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:33.385\nAnd the proper level of oversight with\nregards to our abilities to be able to not\n\n48\n00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.485\nonly offer guidance, but\n\n49\n00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:38.360\nto cost effectively drive forward\nsecurity within the organization.\n\n50\n00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.620\nI talk a lot to customers about whether or\nnot they want to spend time developing\n\n51\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.020\ntheir own applications in the Cloud or\nconsume essentially, right?\n\n52\n00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.760\nPrepackaged apps that somebody else has\nspent the time and effort to develop.\n\n53\n00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.172\nAnd some businesses, some of my customers\nsay, we wanna have our own apps.\n\n54\n00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:53.890\nWe wanna brand them and\n\n55\n00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.350\nessentially make them ourselves and\ngive them our own look and feel.\n\n56\n00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.060\nWe've got the development resources,\nthe development talent, the capabilities,\n\n57\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.860\nso there's no reason why\nwe shouldn't do that.\n\n58\n00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.067\nAnd I say, you're absolutely right,\nthat's perfectly fine.\n\n59\n00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:09.687\nBut then in other cases, we may want\nto either buy an application and\n\n60\n00:03:09.687 --> 00:03:13.133\nessentially use that and\npush that forward for functionality.\n\n61\n00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:17.193\nOr through a SAAS model, rent application\nlike capabilities to provide to our\n\n62\n00:03:17.193 --> 00:03:20.021\nend users or customers,\nto be able to work with data and\n\n63\n00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:22.803\nto be able to provide\nthe functionality that we need.\n\n64\n00:03:22.803 --> 00:03:26.237\nBecause it may be cheaper ultimately\nto rent or essentially to\n\n65\n00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:30.736\nacquire the use of that application than\nit will be to build it from the ground up.\n\n66\n00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:35.307\nYet we don't often think about what it\ntakes to build a software application and\n\n67\n00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:40.100\nto actually manage it through a life cycle\nuntil we have to engage in that activity.\n\n68\n00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.630\nBut any of you, any of you out there\nthat are even listening to us live, or\n\n69\n00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.680\nany of you that ultimately will go through\nand listen to this content in this\n\n70\n00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.265\nepisode at some point later after\nit's been recorded and posted.\n\n71\n00:03:50.265 --> 00:03:53.273\nYou may know, if you do this or\nare engaged in these activities,\n\n72\n00:03:53.273 --> 00:03:57.295\nthat it's very time consuming and also\nvery expensive to put an application into\n\n73\n00:03:57.295 --> 00:03:59.865\nmarket that has been vetted,\nthat has been tested properly.\n\n74\n00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.400\nAnd ultimately, that is maintained over\ntime to update that functionality.\n\n75\n00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.620\nJust ask Microsoft.\n\n76\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.700\nJust ask Google.\n\n77\n00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.940\nJust ask Amazon.\n\n78\n00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.970\nAsk any of the Cloud vendors and, or\nthe application vendors out there that do\n\n79\n00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.380\nsoftware development how expensive it is\nto develop a new piece of software and\n\n80\n00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.100\nbuild out that product and support it\nover a lifetime or a life cycle of usage.\n\n81\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.950\nIt's very, very, very expensive.\n\n82\n00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.070\nSo we have to think about development\nnot just from a CBA, cost benefit\n\n83\n00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.250\nanalysis perspective, but also from an RA,\na risk assessment perspective.\n\n84\n00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.000\nAnd we have to marry those two\nthought processes together\n\n85\n00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.010\nto ensure we're creating\nfunctionality that is valuable, but\n\n86\n00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.380\nthat also is cost\neffective to the business.\n\n87\n00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.830\nSo Daniel, let me ask you a question.\n\n88\n00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.920\nWould you buy a $500 cup of coffee?\n\n89\n00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.240\n>> Would I buy a $500 cup of coffee?\n\n90\n00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.635\nI highly doubt it since\nI don't drink coffee.\n\n91\n00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:50.690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, you are no longer playing.\n\n92\n00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:51.750\nNo, you're done.\n\n93\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.250\nYou're done.\nWe're not, as a matter of fact, get Wes.\n\n94\n00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.360\nBring Wes in here.\n\n95\n00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.462\nGet me somebody who actually wants\nto be an active participant in this\n\n96\n00:04:58.462 --> 00:04:59.219\nconversation.\n\n97\n00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.484\nSo you don't drink coffee wise guy.\n\n98\n00:05:00.484 --> 00:05:00.984\nOkay, so let's try something else.\n\n99\n00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:02.306\n>> But even if I did,\nI wouldn't buy a $500 coffee.\n\n100\n00:05:02.306 --> 00:05:03.720\n>> Well thank you that's\nwhat I was looking for,\n\n101\n00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.779\nnot that you don't drink coffee.\n\n102\n00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:08.437\nSo the point is, all kidding aside,\nwhether you drink coffee or not,\n\n103\n00:05:08.437 --> 00:05:10.797\nit's essentially just an analogy, right?\n\n104\n00:05:10.797 --> 00:05:14.603\nAnd the idea is that a $500 cup of coffee,\neven if you don't drink coffee,\n\n105\n00:05:14.603 --> 00:05:17.100\nis probably outrageous\nfrom a price perspective.\n\n106\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.134\nYou would just think a $500 cup of coffee,\n\n107\n00:05:19.134 --> 00:05:21.907\nwhat could I do with $500 other\nthan buy that cup of coffee?\n\n108\n00:05:21.907 --> 00:05:23.980\nAt least that's what I\nwould think about it,\n\n109\n00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:26.310\nprobably what you would\nthink about as well.\n\n110\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.680\nWe could probably put that\nmoney to good use elsewhere.\n\n111\n00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.490\nBut if it wasn't a cup of coffee but\nrather, I don't know,\n\n112\n00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.635\nsomething that may be important to you,\nthat may be valuable.\n\n113\n00:05:33.635 --> 00:05:38.660\n$500 computer if you're\nan IT professional.\n\n114\n00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.670\nWould you buy a $500 pair of\nshoes if you are into shoes?\n\n115\n00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.230\nI don't know.\n\n116\n00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.630\nMaybe you would, maybe you wouldn't.\n\n117\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.030\nI'm not that into shoes.\n\n118\n00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.050\nThey're on my feet,\nI don't intend to look at them very often,\n\n119\n00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.000\nand they tend to be on\nthe ground a lot and get dirty.\n\n120\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.140\nSo for me, $500 would not be a good,\nwise investment in shoes.\n\n121\n00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.960\nBut if you asked me about\nhand-painted silk ties, I would say,\n\n122\n00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.740\nabsolutely, I would buy\na $500 hand-painted silk tie.\n\n123\n00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.460\nIf you had one that caught my fancy,\nthat I thought was a good investment for\n\n124\n00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.530\nme, cuz I happen to, when I do get dressed\nup, believe it or not, you look at me,\n\n125\n00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.370\nyou wouldn't know, given the general\nappearance I have when I am here, but in\n\n126\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.450\nmy other life, where I actually do dress\nup for work, and on occasion, have to be\n\n127\n00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.930\nin a suit and tie to meet with customers,\nI actually clean up rather well.\n\n128\n00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.120\nYou would be surprised what I look\nlike when I am clean shaven, and\n\n129\n00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.590\nI actually have on a suit and tie.\n\n130\n00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.135\nAnd I do, by the way, own suits and\nties, believe it or not.\n\n131\n00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:25.326\n[LAUGH]\n>> For your court appearances, right?\n\n132\n00:06:25.326 --> 00:06:26.035\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, [LAUGH] for\n\n133\n00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:26.820\nmy court appearances.\n\n134\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.400\nAlthough I never wear them here.\n\n135\n00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.810\nOnly when I'm being photographed from\nthe side with a placard under me\n\n136\n00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.055\nspecifying my unique identifier in what\nwe call the system do I wear those.\n\n137\n00:06:36.055 --> 00:06:38.745\nBut when I do have to go on client\nmeetings, all kidding aside,\n\n138\n00:06:38.745 --> 00:06:41.795\nI do sometimes have to get dressed\nup to do so, I am in a suit and tie.\n\n139\n00:06:41.795 --> 00:06:44.755\nAnd I do wear one fairly often and\nthere are certain things that may be\n\n140\n00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:47.585\nimportant to me that won't be important\nto you, that I would spend money on.\n\n141\n00:06:47.585 --> 00:06:52.010\nSo my point is that, regardless of\nwhat the value is and where it lies,\n\n142\n00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.490\nwe have to perceive it before we would\nfeel that it's a good investment, right?\n\n143\n00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.470\n500 bucks for a cup of coffee,\nprobably not.\n\n144\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.496\n500 bucks for a computer,\nyeah that may catch Daniel's attention,\n\n145\n00:07:00.496 --> 00:07:03.610\nhe may wanna spend that money if\nit's something he finds valuable.\n\n146\n00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.092\nAnd we all have that thing,\nwhatever it is.\n\n147\n00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.575\nAnd as Cloud customers we have\nthat thing with Cloud services.\n\n148\n00:07:09.575 --> 00:07:11.298\nWe've got to find the right service, but\n\n149\n00:07:11.298 --> 00:07:15.600\nthere may be a list of services\nthat would be attractive to us.\n\n150\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.160\nCould you just on the spur of\nthe moment here go out to Amazon?\n\n151\n00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.950\nGo to AWS and just bring up the menu.\n\n152\n00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.650\nWhen you're ready, you can tell me and\nwe'll bring it up.\n\n153\n00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.520\nJust bring up the general\nservice offering list, view all\n\n154\n00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.500\nthe service they have, AWS,\nAlastica or whatever they call it.\n\n155\n00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.793\nAWS storage, there's like 30,\n40, 50 services.\n\n156\n00:07:36.793 --> 00:07:37.779\n>> Yeah, I think I got it here.\n\n157\n00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:40.080\n>> Okay, so can we go to Daniel's\nmachine for just a second?\n\n158\n00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.910\nSo if you take a look at all\nthe list of services there,\n\n159\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:45.305\nI can't actually see any of\nthe detail on the screen.\n\n160\n00:07:45.305 --> 00:07:47.352\n[LAUGH] I'm assuming it's what\nI'm talking about, I can't tell.\n\n161\n00:07:47.352 --> 00:07:48.567\n>> There are many [LAUGH]\n>> I can't tell from here, but\n\n162\n00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.319\nthere are many of them.\n\n163\n00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.033\nMy point is not so much hey,\nlet's look at the services, but\n\n164\n00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:53.962\nmore just to show you the categorization.\n\n165\n00:07:53.962 --> 00:07:55.159\nAnd what's available there.\n\n166\n00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:57.309\nYou've got analytic services right?\n\n167\n00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:00.922\nYou have networking services,\nyou've got data management services,\n\n168\n00:08:00.922 --> 00:08:05.120\ndevelopment, platform tools services,\nmanagement tool services, right?\n\n169\n00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.425\nThere's all sorts of stuff there, and\nthere's probably, three or four or five or\n\n170\n00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:09.995\nmore under each category, and\n\n171\n00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:12.635\nyou add those all up, I'm guessing\nthere's gotta be at least 50 or\n\n172\n00:08:12.635 --> 00:08:16.895\n60 out there, probably the same on Azure\nwhen we look at the Microsoft fabric.\n\n173\n00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:18.205\nGoogle, who knows how many they have,\n\n174\n00:08:18.205 --> 00:08:19.695\ndepending on what kind of\nservices we're looking at.\n\n175\n00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:22.505\nI'm sure equally,\nif not a larger amount there.\n\n176\n00:08:22.505 --> 00:08:27.290\nAnd the point is that we're all at\nsome point depending on what we define\n\n177\n00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.680\nthe cloud as being gonna find one or\nmore services as customers\n\n178\n00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.180\nthat are probably valuable to us on\nthat list, but from the perspective of\n\n179\n00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.940\nthe skills and the requirements and\nthe investment it takes to build that.\n\n180\n00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.270\nTo actually build that application,\nbuild the service the cloud provider,\n\n181\n00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.320\nAmazon in this case, or Microsoft or\nwhoever, had to invest time and\n\n182\n00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.350\nmoney to figure out that\nsomebody would want that, and\n\n183\n00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.890\nthen would actually go out and build it,\nand invest the time and energy to do so,\n\n184\n00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.390\nand to do it securely, and then to\noffer it so that we could consume it.\n\n185\n00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.480\nSo cloud development is\nthe same as normal development,\n\n186\n00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.350\njust again put the word cloud in front of\nit, in the sense that it's still app dev.\n\n187\n00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.240\nBut the ideas that ultimately\nare service developed.\n\n188\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.100\nHowever you want to think\nabout an application but\n\n189\n00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:11.370\nthe difference is we are actually\nscaling that application to\n\n190\n00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.520\ntremendously large volumes of access and\navailability,\n\n191\n00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.700\nability over the cloud infrastructure\nwhere as a normal application development\n\n192\n00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.050\ncycle with an application used\non the lan behind the firewall.\n\n193\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.990\nIn a business, may not scale this way.\n\n194\n00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.830\nYou may not have millions of users\nusing an application that's home\n\n195\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.230\ngrown inside a business, but a cloud app\ncould have millions perhaps a billion or\n\n196\n00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:38.860\nmore users look at Facebook over a billion\npeople on the planet use Facebook.\n\n197\n00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.770\nI mean that's one heck of a cloud\napplication when you think about it,\n\n198\n00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.935\nand somebody had to build\na lot of somebodies, right?\n\n199\n00:09:43.935 --> 00:09:45.540\nHow to build that and scale it, so\n\n200\n00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.700\nwe have to think about\ndevelopment basics here right?\n\n201\n00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.330\nGet back to basics to understand how to\ndo it the right way and then scale it up.\n\n202\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.452\nWhat are some of the key questions\nwe would have to offer and\n\n203\n00:09:54.452 --> 00:09:57.909\nthink about with regards to cloud and\ncloud based development?\n\n204\n00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:01.410\nWhat is the assessment of the usage\nof this application look like?\n\n205\n00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:05.843\nWhat kind of scalability are we looking\nat, is it 10, 20, 40, 100, a million,\n\n206\n00:10:05.843 --> 00:10:06.920\na billion users?\n\n207\n00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.297\nWe have to think about\ndeveloping very differently for\n\n208\n00:10:09.297 --> 00:10:12.460\na billion users than we do developing for\na hundred users, right?\n\n209\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.487\nAnd so what would the impact be\nif the asset, the application,\n\n210\n00:10:15.487 --> 00:10:17.200\nbecame that widely available?\n\n211\n00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.720\nBut also what would the asset,\nthe availability and the concerns be,\n\n212\n00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.300\nif that asset became widely available and\nthen became disrupted?\n\n213\n00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.140\nIt was not available.\n\n214\n00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.910\nCan you imagine Facebook, I'm not\na Facebook person, I could care less,\n\n215\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.140\nbut could you imagine\nFacebook not being available?\n\n216\n00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.520\nThose 1 billion people would be pissed,\nright?\n\n217\n00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.320\nI mean I know some people\nthat that's all they do.\n\n218\n00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.000\n>> It'd be utter chaos.\n\n219\n00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.900\n>> And what would you do when you're\ndriving and have nothing to distract you?\n\n220\n00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.300\nYou'd actually have to drive,\nI mean imagine how chaotic that would be.\n\n221\n00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.113\nYou're actually paying attention and\ndriving,\n\n222\n00:10:44.113 --> 00:10:45.588\nthat would just be catastrophic right?\n\n223\n00:10:45.588 --> 00:10:46.564\nInstead being distracted.\n\n224\n00:10:46.564 --> 00:10:48.678\n>> We need to go with this,\nI like your ideas already.\n\n225\n00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:49.450\n[LAUGH]\n>> We would that.\n\n226\n00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.794\nThat's like the second one after\nhurricane pizza we're gonna,\n\n227\n00:10:52.794 --> 00:10:54.333\nwe're gonna nuke Facebook.\n\n228\n00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:55.035\nAnti-Facebook.\n\n229\n00:10:55.035 --> 00:10:56.605\nThe anti-Facebook Facebook.\n\n230\n00:10:56.605 --> 00:10:58.175\nAnd we'll actually make\nthe world a safer place.\n\n231\n00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:00.545\nAnd this one will actually\nmake the world a safer place,\n\n232\n00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:03.245\nright because you won't be\ndistracted doing all the other stuff\n\n233\n00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:06.315\nyou should not be doing when you're trying\nto do the stuff you should be doing.\n\n234\n00:11:06.315 --> 00:11:08.655\nBut you know just think about\nthe logic of this instrument, right.\n\n235\n00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:11.555\nWhether it's Facebook or\nanything else, whatever it is,\n\n236\n00:11:11.555 --> 00:11:15.325\nFacebook's just one of probably the\nbroadest categories we could look at and\n\n237\n00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:18.631\nthe broadest example of the clouds\nscaled app on the planet today and\n\n238\n00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:22.093\nI can't think of many apps that\nare scaled to that degree.\n\n239\n00:11:22.093 --> 00:11:25.483\nSo when you think about something like\nthat and you think about the fact that\n\n240\n00:11:25.483 --> 00:11:29.653\nliterally at any given moment in time\nthere may be up to a billion people on\n\n241\n00:11:29.653 --> 00:11:33.446\nthat platform accessing data,\nexchanging information, if not\n\n242\n00:11:33.446 --> 00:11:38.536\nsimultaneously then certainly across the\n24 hour usage period, in and out right.\n\n243\n00:11:38.536 --> 00:11:40.926\nThat's a lot of transactions,\na lot of data,\n\n244\n00:11:40.926 --> 00:11:45.046\na lot of scalability that somebody's gotta\nplan for and manage and if that goes out\n\n245\n00:11:45.046 --> 00:11:47.936\nsomebody's gotta worry, a lot of\nsomebodies have to worry about that.\n\n246\n00:11:47.936 --> 00:11:51.446\nWhat would the impact be if the employee,\nan employee using our application,\n\n247\n00:11:51.446 --> 00:11:56.170\nwhatever our application it is,\nof our cloud provider, access the asset.\n\n248\n00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:58.150\nIn other words,\nyou'll think about, whether or\n\n249\n00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:00.800\nnot somebody that's not\nauthorized to use it accesses it.\n\n250\n00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.060\nAnd then somebody at the cloud provider,\n\n251\n00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:07.520\nthat's not authorized, accesses the app,\nwith even more level of access.\n\n252\n00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.590\nMore access control, more granularity.\n\n253\n00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.930\nBecause they work for\nthe provider where we're hosting,\n\n254\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:15.570\nthey probably have almost unrestricted\naccess on the back end to the data,\n\n255\n00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.600\nto the application,\nto the monitoring, to the management.\n\n256\n00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.340\nI mean, they could do some\nsignificant damage if they wanted to.\n\n257\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.210\nAnd we may or may not know that.\n\n258\n00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.130\nWe may or may not be aware of that, right?\n\n259\n00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.350\nWe may never know, by the way,\nbecause they may cover their tracks.\n\n260\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:29.560\nWe may never find out.\n\n261\n00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.880\nI mean that could be a big issue.\n\n262\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.880\nWhat would the impact be if the processor\nfunction were manipulated by an outsider?\n\n263\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.300\nWhat if somebody got into\nthe application stream, a bad actor, and\n\n264\n00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.450\nwas able to manipulate the data?\n\n265\n00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:40.710\nWhat if somebody went in and\n\n266\n00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.660\nstarted posting stuff randomly\non people's Facebook walls?\n\n267\n00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.850\nAnd decided to do all\nsorts of crazy stuff.\n\n268\n00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.435\nI mean this could lead to chaos,\ngovernments could fall,\n\n269\n00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.773\nwe could have riots in the streets,\nwho knows what?\n\n270\n00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:53.730\nAll sorts of stuff could happen.\n\n271\n00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.400\nWhat would be the impact of the process or\nwhat would be the impact rather if\n\n272\n00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.880\nthe process or function failed to provide\nsome sort of expected result, meaning if\n\n273\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:07.380\nwe were expecting a backup solution\nto run once every night, let's say at\n\n274\n00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.769\nmaybe two in the morning, localized time,\nwhatever that is across our geography.\n\n275\n00:13:12.778 --> 00:13:15.700\nAnd we were expecting a full backup\nof all of our cloud data and\n\n276\n00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.830\ninstead of running the system just didn't\nkick off or it ran in a totally time\n\n277\n00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:24.610\nbecause somebody went and messed around\nwith UTC and time coordination and\n\n278\n00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:29.630\nlocalization because they messed up our\nNTPR, Network Time Protocol process.\n\n279\n00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.968\nAnd we no longer had the 2 AM window\nevery space geographically localized on\n\n280\n00:13:33.968 --> 00:13:37.038\nthe planet that we operate\nrunning simultaneously.\n\n281\n00:13:37.038 --> 00:13:39.871\nIn other words, we didn't kick-off at\n2 o'clock in the morning everywhere.\n\n282\n00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:42.700\nWe missed our change management and\nour maintenance windows.\n\n283\n00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.520\nAnd we ran the backup not at 2 o'clock\nlocalized or 2 AM localized, but\n\n284\n00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:50.050\nrather 2 AM Eastern US time, and\n\n285\n00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.830\nthen propagated out to whatever time\nthat is actually around the world.\n\n286\n00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.770\nSo it may kick off in the middle of the\nbusiness day, may take off in the morning,\n\n287\n00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.880\nwho knows what, but\nthat could be incredibly disruptive.\n\n288\n00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.360\nThat could creat denial of service or\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n289\n00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.897\n>> I remember a hack, I think,\n\n290\n00:14:02.897 --> 00:14:06.492\nhappened back in one of the Bell\nsystems where somebody hacked in.\n\n291\n00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:10.687\nThe guy accessed those systems, and they\njust changed the time from AM to PM, and\n\n292\n00:14:10.687 --> 00:14:14.883\nat that point in time, this was like I\nthink back in the early 80s or late 70s,\n\n293\n00:14:14.883 --> 00:14:18.958\nthat meant that all that long distance and\npeak time hours, the rate change and\n\n294\n00:14:18.958 --> 00:14:20.656\ncost them millions of dollars.\n\n295\n00:14:20.656 --> 00:14:22.655\n>> Right because they would\ncharge a lot less right or\n\n296\n00:14:22.655 --> 00:14:24.620\ncharge a lot more depending\non what time it was.\n\n297\n00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.960\nYou would pay a premium to call\nduring business hours most likely.\n\n298\n00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.680\nAnd then a very reduced rate depending\non what it was at certain other times.\n\n299\n00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:38.000\nYou see that with power consumption, not\nonly with businesses, but at home as well.\n\n300\n00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.170\nFPL, the utility certainly here in\nSouth Florida where we are in Florida,\n\n301\n00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.800\nI should say Northern Central Florida\nwhere we are now.\n\n302\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.010\nBut in general, in Florida and\n\n303\n00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.100\nthroughout many of the Southern States,\nthey will actually try to incentivize\n\n304\n00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.950\nusers during summer to run appliances at\ncertain off peak hours late at night.\n\n305\n00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.830\nSo they say, hey set the dishwasher up,\nset the laundry up.\n\n306\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.900\nThings like that to run late at night,\nright,\n\n307\n00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.770\nbecause there's less demand\ngeneration at that point.\n\n308\n00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.250\nAnd as a result, you're gonna get\nto spend less money on power.\n\n309\n00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:09.800\nBecause you’re not taxing the grid\nbecause were not having to generate\n\n310\n00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.660\nall this extra power during the day when\nyou want air conditioning non stop and\n\n311\n00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.320\nall that other stuff.\n\n312\n00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.501\nWhich is a very highly consumable\npower enabled application or product.\n\n313\n00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:22.320\nSo we got to think about these things\nbecause we could skew the way that systems\n\n314\n00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.097\nwork and this happens all the time.\n\n315\n00:15:24.097 --> 00:15:28.110\nSo you've got these fully connected\nInternet of thing converged systems now\n\n316\n00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.886\nwhere we can do building management,\nwe can do home,\n\n317\n00:15:30.886 --> 00:15:33.617\nthermostat maintenance all\nthat stuff can be done.\n\n318\n00:15:33.617 --> 00:15:36.510\nIf somebody wants to hack into these\nsystems and start monkeying around,\n\n319\n00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.105\nimagine the chaos that they can create.\n\n320\n00:15:38.105 --> 00:15:41.813\nAnd we're talking about building\nmanagement systems, and power consumption,\n\n321\n00:15:41.813 --> 00:15:44.875\nand all sorts of things that are web\nenabled today and essentially,\n\n322\n00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:45.802\nrun in the same way.\n\n323\n00:15:45.802 --> 00:15:48.849\nSo this is a very broad thought process,\nall these things and\n\n324\n00:15:48.849 --> 00:15:52.076\nthere's more of them this is just three or\nfour examples right,\n\n325\n00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:55.959\nwould have to be considered as part of\na general assessment of the development\n\n326\n00:15:55.959 --> 00:15:58.920\ncapabilities that we have to\nbring to bear to run this app.\n\n327\n00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.084\nBut whether it's also considered to\nbe cloud friendly, would also be very\n\n328\n00:16:02.084 --> 00:16:05.760\nimportant for us to think about,\nas we begin to do development.\n\n329\n00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.710\nAgain, from the security professional's\nperspective, it's not so much about,\n\n330\n00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.170\nam I able to develop an app a certain way,\nand, if I am great,\n\n331\n00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:18.760\nif I'm not great, or not great, I may not\nknow what secure development means, but\n\n332\n00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.750\nI may know that there are certain things\nthat have to be done in order to make sure\n\n333\n00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.360\nthe application runs the right way.\n\n334\n00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.770\nAnd I have to offer that guidance and\nintegrate that into the development cycle,\n\n335\n00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.110\nso that the people that are experts at\ndevelopment, understand the dos and\n\n336\n00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:33.965\ndon'ts, and\nare not caught short in effect, right?\n\n337\n00:16:33.965 --> 00:16:35.700\nBy this, because that can be a problem.\n\n338\n00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.700\nThe choice and use of secure API's,\nfor instance, right?\n\n339\n00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.850\nApplication Programmatic Interfaces,\nis very important.\n\n340\n00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.447\nWe often talk with cloud about\nthe fact that the cloud vendor,\n\n341\n00:16:45.447 --> 00:16:50.427\nthe application providers, or the SAAS\nprovider, or on the management side, the,\n\n342\n00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:54.925\neither IAS or PAAS provider, with\nregards to the management plane aspects,\n\n343\n00:16:54.925 --> 00:16:59.383\nprovides a secure API, or whatever API\nthey choose for us to interact with.\n\n344\n00:16:59.383 --> 00:17:03.397\nSo it's the software and cloud vendors\nthat really have to decide on the security\n\n345\n00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:07.589\nand the viability of the cloud application\nbecause the APIs, if they are insecure,\n\n346\n00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.737\nwill lead to compromise, and so,\nwe have to think about that.\n\n347\n00:17:10.737 --> 00:17:15.515\nMany cloud environments, you must use APIs\nto access management, to access data,\n\n348\n00:17:15.515 --> 00:17:18.410\nto access configuration,\nto access monitoring,\n\n349\n00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.700\nany of those capabilities, right?\n\n350\n00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:24.745\nWe may typically see, and we often do see,\nAPI is broken down into two,\n\n351\n00:17:24.745 --> 00:17:26.705\nvery large categories.\n\n352\n00:17:26.705 --> 00:17:31.855\nOne is REST, or RESTful, REpresentational\nState Transfer APIs, RESTful APIs\n\n353\n00:17:31.855 --> 00:17:36.585\nare often referred to as, and or SOAP,\nSimple Object Access Protocol, based APIs.\n\n354\n00:17:36.585 --> 00:17:40.475\nSo we have to think about the different\nformats that are available to us\n\n355\n00:17:40.475 --> 00:17:43.835\nbecause we may be offered one or both and\nwe may have a preference for one or\n\n356\n00:17:43.835 --> 00:17:48.090\nthe other and we do need to understand\nthat while both can be secure,\n\n357\n00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:50.980\nboth may not be the best choice,\ngiven certain situations.\n\n358\n00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.560\nSo we have to understand that and again,\n\n359\n00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.330\nwork with our vendors to\nunderstand what they're giving us.\n\n360\n00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.970\nYou know, woe, right, to the customer.\n\n361\n00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:03.470\nWoe to the cloud customer that does\nnot exercise due diligence and\n\n362\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.590\ndue care, and does not ask ahead of time\nbefore they contract with a cloud vendor.\n\n363\n00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:08.650\nWhat kind of APIs?\n\n364\n00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.770\nWhat kind of access?\n\n365\n00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:11.110\nWhat level of control?\n\n366\n00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:14.170\nWhat are the expectations I have or\ncan expect?\n\n367\n00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:19.310\nAnd we understand all that, so that way we\nare consuming on platforms in ways that\n\n368\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:23.430\nmake sense to us and are aligned with the\ncurrent infrastructure we already manage.\n\n369\n00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:26.880\nIf we have to switch over to a different\nAPI format than one we've ever used\n\n370\n00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.540\nbefore, and the web applications and the\nbrowsers that we use are not compatible,\n\n371\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.660\nthat can be a significant disruptive event\nfor us, and that may actually lead to some\n\n372\n00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.370\nvery, very significant consequences, so,\nagain, we have to be thinking about this.\n\n373\n00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.050\nIt's up to us as CCSPs, in other words,\nto exercise due care, and\n\n374\n00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.350\nto exercise the appropriate amount\nof oversight through due diligence,\n\n375\n00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.990\nto ensure that the business, despite\ntheir best efforts to the contrary,\n\n376\n00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:53.210\ndoes not shoot themselves in the foot and\nmake a mistake knowingly.\n\n377\n00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.793\nIn other words, if we could've\navoided that by exercising some, hey,\n\n378\n00:18:56.793 --> 00:19:01.337\nlet's stop and wait minute, common sense,\nlet's talk about this, that's important.\n\n379\n00:19:01.337 --> 00:19:05.461\nWe have to interject that level of detail,\nthat thought, into the dialogue,\n\n380\n00:19:05.461 --> 00:19:10.461\nbecause remember, the business, typically\nrepresented by senior stakeholders, i.e.,\n\n381\n00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:15.037\nsenior managers, C-level executives,\nmay or may not understand this technology.\n\n382\n00:19:15.037 --> 00:19:18.328\nWhen we talk about APIs, a lot of times\npeople don't know what we're talking about\n\n383\n00:19:18.328 --> 00:19:19.860\nuntil we explain it to them.\n\n384\n00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.380\nI'll say to a customer, so\n\n385\n00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:25.140\nwhat kind of APIs are you\nusing to connect to the cloud?\n\n386\n00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.590\nAnd I'll have a bunch of blank stares and\njust crickets chirping,\n\n387\n00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.520\nright, they won't know.\n\n388\n00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.815\nAnd I'll step back and say, okay,\nwait a second, audience relevancy,\n\n389\n00:19:30.815 --> 00:19:35.490\nessentially, let's make sure we translate\nthis into something that makes sense to\n\n390\n00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:38.970\nthe audience, so when I ask differently,\nwhat kind of software,\n\n391\n00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.580\nwhat kind of application are you using\nto access your data in the cloud,\n\n392\n00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.630\nwe use a web browser,\nwe use Google Chrome.\n\n393\n00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.980\nWell, great, so\nyou're using a web based API,\n\n394\n00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.340\nthe vendor has said that you can use\neither a RESTful or a SOAP based API,\n\n395\n00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.720\ndoesn't matter which, or you know,\nan API of one of those types.\n\n396\n00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.670\nAnd essentially,\nwe're supporting both, and\n\n397\n00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:58.820\nChrome is your browser of choice,\noutstanding.\n\n398\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.310\nSo that's all I need to know.\n\n399\n00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:03.810\nSo, I've gotten the information I need,\nbut I've had to address it with\n\n400\n00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.920\nthe customer in a way that's relevant\nto them that they understand.\n\n401\n00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.350\nSo just because we as security\nprofessionals understand,\n\n402\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.930\nin theory,\nunderstand the language of the cloud,\n\n403\n00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.130\ndoesn't mean we can always use\nit with our customers, right?\n\n404\n00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.850\nWe have to make sure we are relevant\nin our communication, and\n\n405\n00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.550\nappropriate in our communication,\n\n406\n00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.790\nto translate that information into\na format that makes sense to the customer.\n\n407\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.390\nAnd that's very important, and\nthe cloud providers, more and more today,\n\n408\n00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:29.900\nare doing a better job of this.\n\n409\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.610\nThey've really gotten smart about this,\nand understand that the average customer\n\n410\n00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:38.620\nmay not be a business that is very\nversed in this technology, but\n\n411\n00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.960\nrather a point person for\nthe business that may or\n\n412\n00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.150\nmay not understand what they're being\ntold by the cloud vendor, and so\n\n413\n00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:48.280\nthey've really essentially streamlined\nthat application mileage dramatically.\n\n414\n00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.745\nThey've simplified it, and made it very\napproachable in language that even\n\n415\n00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:55.531\nan average layman, and average layperson,\nwill probably be able to reason through\n\n416\n00:20:55.531 --> 00:20:59.506\nand understand, and because of that, we've\nseen cloud adoption go through the roof.\n\n417\n00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:03.663\nIt's just skyrocketing around the world\nwith regards to services and businesses.\n\n418\n00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:07.076\nSo, common pitfalls are things we\nhave to avoid, lack of understanding,\n\n419\n00:21:07.076 --> 00:21:10.650\nlack of audience relevancy,\nvery important for us to think about that.\n\n420\n00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:14.040\nLack of training and awareness will be the\nbroad category we can put that up under\n\n421\n00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.220\ncuz people don't know\nwhat they don't know and\n\n422\n00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.160\nwe have to explain to them in ways\nthat makes it approachable for them.\n\n423\n00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.810\nNot all apps are always cloud ready,\nas I explained,\n\n424\n00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.090\nso we have to be aware of that fact that\njust because a vendor says it will work,\n\n425\n00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:28.380\ndoesn't mean it will, it may not work\nin our world with our environment.\n\n426\n00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.770\nRemember, one size fits one is the by\nword and the watch word for the cloud.\n\n427\n00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:35.170\nIt is not a one size fits all environment.\n\n428\n00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.900\nYes, we generically have web browsers\nthat work on multiple platforms.\n\n429\n00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.100\nBut Chrome may not be the best answer for\nevery application, access point for\n\n430\n00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:47.090\nevery API, and\nIE may not also be the best choice.\n\n431\n00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:51.890\nI use many apps that are cloud enabled\nthat will not run well on one browser,\n\n432\n00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.860\nbut run very well on another,\nand run marginally well,\n\n433\n00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.450\nmeaning they sometimes work,\nsometimes don't, on a third.\n\n434\n00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:02.070\nSo we constantly are having to\nshift around to figure this out.\n\n435\n00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.350\nMaking sure that we're thinking about\non-prem, and the fact that running on-prem\n\n436\n00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:09.290\nversus running in the cloud\nis not the same thing, and\n\n437\n00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:14.230\nthat just because it works on-prem,\ndoesn't mean it'll translate to the cloud,\n\n438\n00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.940\neasily and well, and\nthat there may be problems.\n\n439\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.840\nSo, just because we got\nit running on-prem,\n\n440\n00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.670\ndoesn't mean we can translate\nthat into the cloud.\n\n441\n00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.100\nIt may not work that way.\n\n442\n00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.540\nThe situation, the capabilities,\nthe resources, the structure may not be\n\n443\n00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.490\nmirrored, may not be identical,\nand we may not be able to make\n\n444\n00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:34.390\nan on-prem to the cloud leap successfully,\nunless we change our approach.\n\n445\n00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.820\nWe may not realize that until we\nactually go and attempt to do so.\n\n446\n00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:39.030\nLack of documentation.\n\n447\n00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.110\nLack of proper understanding\nof the guidelines.\n\n448\n00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:45.330\nLack of functional representation\nof the state and therefore,\n\n449\n00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.850\nthe understanding of what's going on in\nthe cloud, can be catastrophic to us.\n\n450\n00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.720\nIt can really just cause\nall sorts of problems.\n\n451\n00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.880\nIf the vendor, the cloud vendor, is not\ndoing a good job of exposing that data and\n\n452\n00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.590\nhelping us to document it,\nwe may not understand what's happening\n\n453\n00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:01.030\nmoment to moment, and\nthat can really be a bit of a problem.\n\n454\n00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:01.950\nComplexities for\n\n455\n00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.230\nintegration and interoperability\nbetween on-prem and the cloud and\n\n456\n00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.010\nsyncing the two together from an app dev\nperspective can be very, very problematic.\n\n457\n00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:12.620\nWe may not be able to really\nunderstand how to do so successfully.\n\n458\n00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.260\nThat can lead to problems.\n\n459\n00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.770\nSo we know that on-prem does not\nalways transfer out to the cloud.\n\n460\n00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:22.800\nSo, for instance I had\na customer a couple of years ago\n\n461\n00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.846\nthat wanted to take an on-prem database\nthat was like an internal home-grown\n\n462\n00:23:26.846 --> 00:23:29.340\nkind of CRM thing that\nthey had been managing.\n\n463\n00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:33.480\nAnd they wanted to port it out to the\ncloud, essentially, to broaden the reach,\n\n464\n00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:37.870\nget better data, analytics, better BI,\nbetter visualization, things like that.\n\n465\n00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:42.010\nAnd they were opening up some satellite\noffices that were geographically,\n\n466\n00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.640\nrelatively far away from the home base.\n\n467\n00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.770\nAnd they really were struggling with how\nto make this data available because it\n\n468\n00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:49.490\nwasn't really built to be scalable.\n\n469\n00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:50.750\nAnd so, as a result,\n\n470\n00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:53.860\nit wasn't gonna be available to these\nremote offices very well or very easily.\n\n471\n00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.821\nAnd so we had to come up with\na way to kind of do this.\n\n472\n00:23:55.821 --> 00:23:59.122\nSo, they thought, well, we should be able\nto, the term we often use is forklift.\n\n473\n00:23:59.122 --> 00:24:03.139\nWe should be able to forklift the app into\nthe cloud, essentially, just port it over.\n\n474\n00:24:03.139 --> 00:24:06.622\nAnd on the surface it sounded like it\nwould make sense until they got into it\n\n475\n00:24:06.622 --> 00:24:09.601\nand they found very quickly that\nthe development shortcuts and\n\n476\n00:24:09.601 --> 00:24:13.139\nthe things that had been done to get it\nworking in the on-prem world were not\n\n477\n00:24:13.139 --> 00:24:14.638\ngonna translate to the cloud.\n\n478\n00:24:14.638 --> 00:24:17.210\nThat just it would not be allowed,\nit wouldn't work that way,\n\n479\n00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.810\nwe didn't have that level of access, and\nas a result it just wasn't gonna work.\n\n480\n00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:25.760\nThey wound up ultimately having to go and\ngo to a SaaS model with a CRM vendor\n\n481\n00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.750\nthat ultimately would provide them\nthe capabilities they needed.\n\n482\n00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.610\nBut they had to essentially\nchuck the homegrown system,\n\n483\n00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.360\nextract the data off through\nan ETL process, upload and\n\n484\n00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.290\ntransform the data into the cloud\nvendor's application front-end, and\n\n485\n00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:44.210\nthen use the cloud APIs to run the data as\na hosted application model in the cloud.\n\n486\n00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:48.687\nSo that worked out well over time, but the\ncloud offered a great alternate solution,\n\n487\n00:24:48.687 --> 00:24:53.260\nbut did not offer a portable solution\nthat would allow them to migrate cleanly.\n\n488\n00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.571\nSo we have to think about that and\n\n489\n00:24:54.571 --> 00:24:56.970\nobviously understand\nthe impact of those things.\n\n490\n00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.490\nLack of documentation, as I mentioned,\ncan really be a huge, huge challenge.\n\n491\n00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.655\nAlso lack of understanding\nthe capabilities and\n\n492\n00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:09.682\nthe inabilities of the platform we\nchoose from a service model perspective.\n\n493\n00:25:09.682 --> 00:25:14.660\nIaaS versus PaaS versus SaaS can\nalso be a bit of a challenge here.\n\n494\n00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.250\nWe may or may not understand\nhow to integrate properly and\n\n495\n00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.470\nhow to control properly\nwhat's going on there.\n\n496\n00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.480\nWe have to think about that, and\nwe also have to think about dependencies.\n\n497\n00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.310\nRemember, if we're engaging in the use\nof encryption across the data spectrum,\n\n498\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:32.990\ndata at rest, data in motion, data in use,\nand we are not understanding the value and\n\n499\n00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.170\nindeed the do's and don'ts of\nencryption in every one of those areas,\n\n500\n00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.390\nand the dependencies that\nencryption entails and\n\n501\n00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.280\nengenders in our systems,\nwe are gonna have a problem.\n\n502\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.710\nWe may encrypt data and have no way\nto un-encrypt it at the client side,\n\n503\n00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:49.210\nbecause we're not using an application\nthat is encryption aware and/or\n\n504\n00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.650\nthat is aligned with the encryption\nmodel we have chosen.\n\n505\n00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.260\nIt may be encryption-capable, but\n\n506\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.749\nit may not support the level of encryption\nwe're using, in which case it won't work.\n\n507\n00:25:56.749 --> 00:25:58.963\nThat's not something you want\nto find out after the fact.\n\n508\n00:25:58.963 --> 00:26:01.370\nThat's something you want to\nknow about ahead of time.\n\n509\n00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.320\nSo when we think about all these\nprecursors and things we have to\n\n510\n00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.220\nthrow into the bucket and throw into the\nmixture with regard to a secure SDLC, we\n\n511\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.430\nhave to think about all that and then also\nthink about the phases of the SDLC itself.\n\n512\n00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.560\nThe SDLC, the system or\nsoftware development life cycle,\n\n513\n00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.415\nhas very distinct phases, and\nwe need to understand what they are.\n\n514\n00:26:19.415 --> 00:26:23.335\nAs a CCSP, you are gonna be responsible\nresponsible for knowing these phases.\n\n515\n00:26:23.335 --> 00:26:25.350\nYou do need to understand them,\nknow them in order.\n\n516\n00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:30.752\nDefining, designing, developing,\ntesting are typically the four phases\n\n517\n00:26:30.752 --> 00:26:36.610\nwe often think about and will call out\nas a bedrock foundation around any SDLC.\n\n518\n00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:39.860\nSo define, design, develop, and test.\n\n519\n00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.720\nBut there are typically others\nthat will be included there.\n\n520\n00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.640\nSome sort of secure operations phase and\nof course a disposal phase\n\n521\n00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:50.480\nwill typically be included in many,\nif not all, of the SDLCs out there.\n\n522\n00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.050\nSo if we go back through them again,\ndefining, designing, developing, testing,\n\n523\n00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.620\nsecure operations, and ultimately\nsome sort of secured disposal phase.\n\n524\n00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.372\nWe have typically six distinct phases\nwe look at within the SDLC, and\n\n525\n00:27:03.372 --> 00:27:07.203\nwe have to understand how to integrate and\nmanage those at some level.\n\n526\n00:27:07.203 --> 00:27:10.290\nIt becomes very, very important for\nus to be able to do that.\n\n527\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.390\nFrom the business\nrequirements perspective,\n\n528\n00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:14.690\nwhen we're thinking about\nbeing able to define,\n\n529\n00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.320\nwe have to understand how to do\nrequirements analysis and gathering.\n\n530\n00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.140\nWe have to understand what\nthe functional versus nonfunctional\n\n531\n00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:21.890\nrequirement conversation is.\n\n532\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.430\nWe have to understand the differentiator.\n\n533\n00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:27.414\nRemember, I've defined those functional\nrequirements as must-haves or\n\n534\n00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:28.660\nneed-to-haves.\n\n535\n00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.510\nI've defined the nonfunctional\nrequirements as the nice-to-haves or\n\n536\n00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:34.620\nwants as opposed to needs, right?\n\n537\n00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:37.696\nI have that conversation with\nmy teenager all the time.\n\n538\n00:27:37.696 --> 00:27:39.519\nYou have young ones.\n\n539\n00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:44.180\nForget about walking and talking, wait\ntill they start wanting and expecting.\n\n540\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.940\nThat's a whole different\nphase of development, right?\n\n541\n00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:52.750\nBut we're having that conversation more\nand more because she's old enough now, my\n\n542\n00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:58.180\nyoung princess, to be able to now decide\nthat she's entitled to certain things.\n\n543\n00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.920\nI keep telling her the only thing\nshe's entitled to is bread and\n\n544\n00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.450\nwater, and maybe a roof over her\nhead if she's not too obnoxious.\n\n545\n00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.210\nBut until she works,\nmakes money, earns a living and\n\n546\n00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:12.610\nactually brings it back, puts it in\nthe bank, she's not entitled to anything.\n\n547\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.670\nShe's entitled to the only things that\nme and my wife decide to give her,\n\n548\n00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:18.490\nwhich may not be all that much if\nthe attitude continues, right?\n\n549\n00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:22.180\nSo as a result, entitlement's\na good thing if you can afford it.\n\n550\n00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:24.930\nEntitlement is not a good thing\nif you're relying on others\n\n551\n00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:26.920\nto feel that they're obligated to you.\n\n552\n00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.452\nSo just make sure you understand when\nwe talk about requirements gathering,\n\n553\n00:28:30.452 --> 00:28:33.720\nup front initially as we\ntalk about the define phase,\n\n554\n00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.000\nthat customers are gonna feel\nentitled to certain functionality.\n\n555\n00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.488\nCustomers are going to\nexpect certain things.\n\n556\n00:28:39.488 --> 00:28:43.045\nYou have to decide as you build\nout an app, you have to decide as\n\n557\n00:28:43.045 --> 00:28:47.755\nthe cloud provider, you have to decide as\nthe CCSP whether they get those things or\n\n558\n00:28:47.755 --> 00:28:51.655\nnot based on whether they're classified\nas functional or nonfunctional.\n\n559\n00:28:51.655 --> 00:28:55.930\nAnd then we agree essentially to build\nan application based on a list of\n\n560\n00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:00.780\nrequirements that we accept, both\nthe developer, the security function, and\n\n561\n00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.960\nthe customer all together agree\nwill be part of that app.\n\n562\n00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.920\nAnd that will be made up of both\nfunctional and nonfunctional requirements.\n\n563\n00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.690\nSo essentially there's\na negotiation that takes place, and\n\n564\n00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.270\nwe have to think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n565\n00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.070\nThis occurs during the defining phase,\nright?\n\n566\n00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:19.042\nAs we go into not just the defining phase\nbut ultimately the designing phase,\n\n567\n00:29:19.042 --> 00:29:23.320\nwe take the definition of the requirements\nand we negotiate what we're gonna do and\n\n568\n00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.641\nwe start to figure out ultimately\nwhat that's gonna look like.\n\n569\n00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:31.249\nWe've gotta start laying out some plans,\nso some blueprints are sketched out,\n\n570\n00:29:31.249 --> 00:29:35.652\nsome designs are decided upon, we may go\nout and not only sketch out things but\n\n571\n00:29:35.652 --> 00:29:39.080\nmaybe look at a proof of concept or\nsomething like that.\n\n572\n00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.292\nWe have to think about\nthe fact that in design,\n\n573\n00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:44.413\nwe are sketching out what\nthe definition of those requirements is\n\n574\n00:29:44.413 --> 00:29:48.231\ngonna ultimately become as we move into\ndevelop, where we're gonna build it.\n\n575\n00:29:48.231 --> 00:29:51.827\nAnd then ultimately test it, where we\nmake sure it doesn't blow up before\n\n576\n00:29:51.827 --> 00:29:54.440\nwe put it into production and\nsecure operations.\n\n577\n00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.510\nWe manage it through its life cycle, and\n\n578\n00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.880\nthen we get rid of it over time,\nwhen it's now the disposal phase.\n\n579\n00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.670\nSo we have to walk through\neach of these six areas and\n\n580\n00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.600\nunderstand exactly what's\nhappening with them in the SDLC.\n\n581\n00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.390\nI saw an interesting program\nlast night on cable,\n\n582\n00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.260\nbecause I happened to be flipping around.\n\n583\n00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:15.270\nI wasn't really doing much work after\nhours, and so I had a little bit of time.\n\n584\n00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:19.763\nAnd it was one of these reality shows\nthat they do on the History Channel or\n\n585\n00:30:19.763 --> 00:30:23.152\non Discovery, and\nit was looking at blacksmithing and\n\n586\n00:30:23.152 --> 00:30:26.188\nwhat a blacksmith kind of does and\nhow they work.\n\n587\n00:30:26.188 --> 00:30:29.436\nIt was this young kid who's\nprobably in his twenties or\n\n588\n00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:32.261\nsomething, lives up in\nthe Ozark Mountains and\n\n589\n00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:36.014\nis keeping this idea of being\na traditional blacksmith alive.\n\n590\n00:30:36.014 --> 00:30:39.298\nHe has his own setup, his own forge and\neverything, and he builds and\n\n591\n00:30:39.298 --> 00:30:43.033\nhe creates guns and all sorts of stuff for\npeople up there, and he sells them and\n\n592\n00:30:43.033 --> 00:30:44.633\nthat's how he makes his living.\n\n593\n00:30:44.633 --> 00:30:47.160\nBut so they were profiling him and\nwhat he was doing, which in and\n\n594\n00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.064\nof itself is really fascinating, right?\n\n595\n00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:53.290\nTo see somebody take just a bunch of\nrandom stuff laying around, scrap wood,\n\n596\n00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:58.590\nscrap metal and through his sweat equity\nand his labor at the back-end produce\n\n597\n00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:01.540\nthings that actually people need and\nthat ultimately they're gonna pay for.\n\n598\n00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.580\nThey showed the process\nhow he makes a gun,\n\n599\n00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.860\nhow he makes a rifle,\nactually a hunting rifle, and\n\n600\n00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.310\nit takes multiple days or weeks,\nso they time lapse through it.\n\n601\n00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:13.440\nBut ultimately they get to the point where\nhe puts it all together and he says,\n\n602\n00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:15.150\nokay, this is all great,\nI think it's good.\n\n603\n00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:17.370\nBut now comes the real hard part,\nnot the building part,\n\n604\n00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:20.140\nnot the sweat equity,\nI gotta go test fire this thing.\n\n605\n00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.213\nAnd if there's a weakness in the barrel or\nwhatever, I got a fire it and\n\n606\n00:31:23.213 --> 00:31:24.650\nit may blow up, right?\n\n607\n00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.480\nAnd so you think about the fact that for\nhundreds, thousands of years,\n\n608\n00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.590\nwe didn't have the ability to mass\nproduce these guns, put them in a secure\n\n609\n00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:36.130\nenvironment somewhere, test fire them,\nand find out whether they would work, or\n\n610\n00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:39.320\nto X-ray them and find out if there\nare stress cracks in the barrel and\n\n611\n00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.540\nknow that's a bad one and not use it.\n\n612\n00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:44.120\nWe did the old-fashioned way, right?\n\n613\n00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.040\nYou put it up against your shoulder,\nyou fire it.\n\n614\n00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.620\nIf the thing blew up, you may or\nmay not have a face when you're done.\n\n615\n00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.615\nSo he goes out and test fires this thing,\nand the guy's smart, so he gets his,\n\n616\n00:31:53.615 --> 00:31:55.655\nhe has two younger brothers.\n\n617\n00:31:55.655 --> 00:31:57.281\nAnd he's like, they're so valuable to me,\n\n618\n00:31:57.281 --> 00:31:59.584\nthey help around the shop and\nthey do this incredible, all this work.\n\n619\n00:31:59.584 --> 00:32:01.784\nAnd then the next thing\nyou see is the young kid,\n\n620\n00:32:01.784 --> 00:32:05.472\nthe young brothers test fire the gun,\ncuz the blacksmith doesn't wanna do it.\n\n621\n00:32:05.472 --> 00:32:07.283\nSince it's kinda funny, right, but\n\n622\n00:32:07.283 --> 00:32:10.069\nthe point is ultimately we've\ngot to test this stuff out.\n\n623\n00:32:10.069 --> 00:32:12.400\nWe got to figure out how it's gonna work.\n\n624\n00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.720\nAnd that's really important also,\ncuz we've gotta put it through its paces.\n\n625\n00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.490\nMake sure the application is secure.\n\n626\n00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.839\nMake sure we understand\nhow that's gonna happen.\n\n627\n00:32:19.839 --> 00:32:23.536\nWe gotta bring software versioning and\nversioning control and\n\n628\n00:32:23.536 --> 00:32:27.982\nchange management into the mix to\nunderstand how do this stuff as well.\n\n629\n00:32:27.982 --> 00:32:30.890\nWe gotta be worried about the\nvulnerabilities that may attach to this\n\n630\n00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:31.740\napplication.\n\n631\n00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.148\nI know you had brought up, at my behest,\nbecause I had asked you to do so\n\n632\n00:32:35.148 --> 00:32:37.720\nbeforehand, and you're always so\nkind when I ask you to do these things.\n\n633\n00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.460\nYou do them.\n\n634\n00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.540\nIf we could go to the OWASP Top 10 list,\n\n635\n00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.245\nI believe you have that\nalong with the STRIDE model.\n\n636\n00:32:43.245 --> 00:32:45.290\nWe'll come back to\nthe STRIDE in just a minute.\n\n637\n00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:49.390\nBut we do have, when we think about\nthe concerns about web application\n\n638\n00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.960\nvulnerabilities, we do have\nthe OWASP Top 10 Web Application Model.\n\n639\n00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.915\nWe actually could use that\none right there, that's good.\n\n640\n00:32:54.915 --> 00:32:58.980\nCuz that has the 13 list on, it's just\nthe older list, juxtaposed with it.\n\n641\n00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.310\nWe've been through it in a prior episode,\nthis list in depth.\n\n642\n00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.740\nWe spent probably 20 minutes breaking this\nlist down, I think, detailing through it,\n\n643\n00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.440\ntalking about it, reminding you\nof where it is and what it is.\n\n644\n00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.050\nBut you wanna go in,\nyou wanna take a look.\n\n645\n00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:12.541\nCan we go to a full screen\nthere just a minute?\n\n646\n00:33:12.541 --> 00:33:13.545\nJust remove me out of the picture.\n\n647\n00:33:13.545 --> 00:33:15.010\nPerfect, so we can see it.\n\n648\n00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:16.470\nSo you'll see the Top 10 list there.\n\n649\n00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:20.770\n2010 on the left-hand side, the earlier,\nearlier version of this list,\n\n650\n00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:26.430\nyou could see the Top 10 2013 updated\nversion that's currently available now.\n\n651\n00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.246\nBut remember, this is a three-year cycle.\n\n652\n00:33:28.246 --> 00:33:32.705\nSometime during 2016, probably mid to late\nin the year, we'll see an update to this.\n\n653\n00:33:32.705 --> 00:33:34.440\nThere'll be a newer, newer version.\n\n654\n00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:39.133\nBut we could see the A1 through A10 list\nand we wanna understand that these common\n\n655\n00:33:39.133 --> 00:33:43.450\nvulnerabilities with regards to web\napplications can be problematic.\n\n656\n00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:45.870\nWe have to take note of them and\ncertainly understand them.\n\n657\n00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.800\nWe went through this in depth, as I said.\n\n658\n00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.370\nIf you are not familiar with this list,\nif you have not seen that episode,\n\n659\n00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.930\nit would be a real good idea for\nyou to go back and do so.\n\n660\n00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:58.640\nAs a CCSP, you are gonna be expected to be\nknowledgable about this list, you're gonna\n\n661\n00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:03.310\nbe expected to answer questions about\nthe potential issues and concerns here.\n\n662\n00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.790\nYou're gonna be expected to\nunderstand how to mitigate them and\n\n663\n00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.470\nwhat kind of controls and compensating\nmechanisms we will put in place\n\n664\n00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.410\nto prevent these attacks from occurring.\n\n665\n00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:16.540\nAll that information was part of that\nconversation we had in the prior episode,\n\n666\n00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.080\nso it's gonna be real important for\nyou to go back and take a look and\n\n667\n00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.660\nmake sure you're comfortable with that,\nright?\n\n668\n00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:23.650\nSo just a word there about\nthese kinds of concerns.\n\n669\n00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.960\nWe have a lot of cloud specific risks,\nright?\n\n670\n00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.710\nAnd we have to make sure\nwe understand them.\n\n671\n00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.170\nRemember, applications running, for\ninstance, within a PaaS environment may\n\n672\n00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.670\nhave to have security controls directly\nbaked right into them, because we may or\n\n673\n00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.030\nmay not have the ability to\ncontrol the application otherwise.\n\n674\n00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:43.160\nWhereas, applications that run in\nan IaaS versus a SaaS environment may be\n\n675\n00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.270\nmanaged differently.\n\n676\n00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.980\nWe control the application\nworkloads in PaaS.\n\n677\n00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.890\nWe don't control them in SaaS.\n\n678\n00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.880\nSo the vendor, the cloud vendor,\nhas to control them.\n\n679\n00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.410\nSo we have to think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n680\n00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:56.150\nWhat about QoS, Quality of Service,\nfor instance, right,\n\n681\n00:34:56.150 --> 00:35:00.550\nbandwidth management, prioritization\nof bandwidth and the movement of data.\n\n682\n00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:03.000\nWe have to think about all these\nthings in the cloud as well.\n\n683\n00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.270\nThat can impact not only performance,\nbut also security.\n\n684\n00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.270\nAnd all these things that I'm talking\nabout are represented up here\n\n685\n00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:10.460\non this list.\n\n686\n00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:13.330\nWhile we're on the screenshot\nof your machine,\n\n687\n00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:17.780\ncan we go to the STRIDE threat model?\n\n688\n00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.874\nYou had it up when we first\npoked our head in there but\n\n689\n00:35:19.874 --> 00:35:21.640\nI wanna quickly mention threat modeling.\n\n690\n00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.740\nI just wanna talk about it.\n\n691\n00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.670\nIf you could zoom in a little\nbit while I'm talking just so\n\n692\n00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.150\nwe can see the general background of it.\n\n693\n00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:33.453\nSo threat modeling is also really\nimportant for the cloud application,\n\n694\n00:35:33.453 --> 00:35:36.188\ndevelopment cycle, which we think about\nSCOCs we have to come up with a way as\n\n695\n00:35:36.188 --> 00:35:39.900\nCCSPs to understand how to model what\nthe potential vulnerabilities and threats\n\n696\n00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.310\nare that we may face, and share that\nthought process with the development team.\n\n697\n00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:47.362\nSo the goal of threat modeling\nis essentially to determine\n\n698\n00:35:47.362 --> 00:35:51.038\nwhere any weaknesses in the application\nand the potential ingress and\n\n699\n00:35:51.038 --> 00:35:54.118\negress points may be\nthat we have to focus on.\n\n700\n00:35:54.118 --> 00:35:58.208\nHard code that knowledge into the app and\nbuild on that to validate that the threats\n\n701\n00:35:58.208 --> 00:36:02.660\nthat we have identified there are being\nmitigated, that they're being addressed.\n\n702\n00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:07.240\nSo we have to think about the ways to do\nthat before the app reaches production.\n\n703\n00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.210\nAnd so one of the mechanisms we can use is\nthe thing called the STRIDE Threat Model.\n\n704\n00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:15.230\nThis is gonna be a model that Microsoft\nput out earlier, and although I think if\n\n705\n00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.740\nI'm not mistaken, it's probably been\nout now for at least ten years or more.\n\n706\n00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.140\nIt's not a well-known model, but\n\n707\n00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.960\nit is a model that we often\nhear about in app dev circles.\n\n708\n00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:26.490\nAnd there are other threat\nmodels that we can use, but\n\n709\n00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:30.210\nthe STRIDE model is one of the ones\nthat's fairly common and it's referenced.\n\n710\n00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:34.234\nAgain Microsoft put it out, there are six\nthreats specifically that they address,\n\n711\n00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:37.590\nevery letter in the acronym STRIDE\nessentially represents a threat.\n\n712\n00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.890\nYou could can see them there.\n\n713\n00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:41.290\nI know Daniel kind of hovering\nover spoofing of identity,\n\n714\n00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:43.080\nif I'm not mistaken there, for the S.\n\n715\n00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.593\nCan we zoom in a little bit so\nyou could see that a little bit better?\n\n716\n00:36:45.593 --> 00:36:48.780\nI know it looks like you're able to\nsee it fairly well if we do that.\n\n717\n00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:54.046\nSo S stands for Spoofing of identity, T\nfor Tampering with data as you could see,\n\n718\n00:36:54.046 --> 00:36:57.762\nR for Repudiation, I for\nInformation disclosure, D for\n\n719\n00:36:57.762 --> 00:37:02.191\nDenial of service and E for\nElevation of privilege attacks or WPXO.\n\n720\n00:37:02.191 --> 00:37:02.959\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n721\n00:37:02.959 --> 00:37:04.876\nthe Lego land numbering system you have.\n\n722\n00:37:04.876 --> 00:37:06.994\nI love the other Mac-\n>> Yeah, it's great.\n\n723\n00:37:06.994 --> 00:37:08.210\n>> That whole thing there, right?\n\n724\n00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.550\nIt looks like a child's toy\nwhich essentially it is.\n\n725\n00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:13.395\n[LAUGH] Even though it is\nan Enterprise-ready computer.\n\n726\n00:37:13.395 --> 00:37:16.817\nAnd so when we think about the different\nacronym or the acronym of STRIDE and\n\n727\n00:37:16.817 --> 00:37:20.507\nthe different things that make it up, we\nsee that all the key areas, again many of\n\n728\n00:37:20.507 --> 00:37:24.010\nthe things that we deal with in the\nOWASP Top 10 list are represented here.\n\n729\n00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.262\nSpoofing and concerns about\nidentity management, tampering,\n\n730\n00:37:27.262 --> 00:37:31.292\nthe idea of tampering with data through\ninjection or some sort of buff overflow.\n\n731\n00:37:31.292 --> 00:37:35.557\nRepudiation, the lack of ability or the\nability to decide that we did or did not\n\n732\n00:37:35.557 --> 00:37:40.320\ndo something and then fess up so we focus\non integrity and non-repudiation here.\n\n733\n00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.949\nInformation disclosure, confidentiality\nconcerns like violating PII,\n\n734\n00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:47.710\nPersonally Identifiable Information,\nconfidentiality, etc.\n\n735\n00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.600\nDenial of service,\ncan we rip out the ability for\n\n736\n00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.152\npeople to access the system and\nmodify that in some way?\n\n737\n00:37:53.152 --> 00:37:56.760\nElevation of privilege, root attacks,\nthings like root kits, for\n\n738\n00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.430\ninstance, and escalation attacks\nall are represented here.\n\n739\n00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:03.540\nWe would have to threat model\nout the application and\n\n740\n00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.490\nunderstand how we deal with every one of\nthese aspects in order to make sure that\n\n741\n00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:08.650\nthe application is developed securely.\n\n742\n00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:10.640\nSo that when we do put it into production,\n\n743\n00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.680\nwe're not exposing any of\nthese elements unnecessarily.\n\n744\n00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:14.910\nAnd this is not just in the cloud,\n\n745\n00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.070\nalthough we're talking about the cloud\nhere, but this is beyond the cloud.\n\n746\n00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.190\nI mean, this is just smart\napplication development,\n\n747\n00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:21.750\nwhether we're in the cloud or not.\n\n748\n00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.600\nAnd we use threat modeling all\nthe time outside of the cloud, but\n\n749\n00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.840\nit becomes especially important\nin the cloud cuz we don't control\n\n750\n00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.440\nas many of the parameters in the cloud\nas we do on-prem when we run this app\n\n751\n00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:35.810\nisolated on our systems behind\nthe firewall on the lab.\n\n752\n00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:38.050\nSo it becomes even more critical for\n\n753\n00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:42.690\nus as security professionals to focus\non threat modeling and to inject that\n\n754\n00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.500\nthreat modeling thought process into the\nsecure application development life cycle.\n\n755\n00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:51.890\nSo into the secure SDLC, very,\nvery important for us to consider here.\n\n756\n00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:56.782\n>> Well, Adam, this has been a whelming\nflood of information when it comes\n\n757\n00:38:56.782 --> 00:38:58.637\nto securing our programs.\n\n758\n00:38:58.637 --> 00:39:01.033\nRight, we're creating\nAPIs on a daily basis.\n\n759\n00:39:01.033 --> 00:39:02.241\nWe do it here on ITProTV,\n\n760\n00:39:02.241 --> 00:39:06.630\nas millions of companies probably across\nthe world that are creating them as well.\n\n761\n00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:10.025\nAnd it's a cool thing that we have\na community of people that say,\n\n762\n00:39:10.025 --> 00:39:12.140\nyou know what, we are security minded.\n\n763\n00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:16.627\nWe need to come at our software\nwith that in mind as well.\n\n764\n00:39:16.627 --> 00:39:20.076\nYou can't just create an application,\nthrow it out into the wild, and\n\n765\n00:39:20.076 --> 00:39:21.870\nexpect everything to be hunky dory.\n\n766\n00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:22.904\nYou have to-\n>> You can, but\n\n767\n00:39:22.904 --> 00:39:25.945\nas evidence to the contrary shows,\nyou shouldn't is what we should say.\n\n768\n00:39:25.945 --> 00:39:26.855\n>> There you go.\n\n769\n00:39:26.855 --> 00:39:28.855\n>> You could, but we should not,\nis what we would want to say.\n\n770\n00:39:28.855 --> 00:39:30.110\n>> Thank you for the correction, sir.\n\n771\n00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:30.648\n>> Absolutely.\n\n772\n00:39:30.648 --> 00:39:33.000\n>> And that's something we want to avoid.\n\n773\n00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:37.160\nIf you create an application, it's\nbasically a gateway for every bad hacker\n\n774\n00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:42.180\nout there to jump and grab data, or\nuse your systems in a malicious way.\n\n775\n00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.720\nThen you've really done\nthe world a disservice.\n\n776\n00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.880\nYou've done yourself a disservice.\n\n777\n00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.470\nYou've done your clients a disservice.\n\n778\n00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:52.190\nAnd that's why we put a lot of\nemphasis on creating secure APIs.\n\n779\n00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.810\nObviously, it's a lot of information.\n\n780\n00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.720\nThere's gonna be training\ninvolved with that.\n\n781\n00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.520\nIf you're a software developer you\nhave to stay on top of that thing, but\n\n782\n00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.264\nagain we've got things\nthat we can lean on.\n\n783\n00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:02.900\nThe OS model, the STRIDE threat models,\n\n784\n00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.295\nto make sure that we are following\na set of guidelines and\n\n785\n00:40:05.295 --> 00:40:10.615\nprocedures that will help us do that very\nthing, and create secure applications.\n\n786\n00:40:10.615 --> 00:40:14.005\nAdam, thank you so much for\npointing this out to us, and\n\n787\n00:40:14.005 --> 00:40:16.855\nas always, giving me a good\ncorrection when necessary.\n\n788\n00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:17.975\n>> No problem.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n789\n00:40:17.975 -->

00:00:20.594\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode, we are continuing forward with\n\n00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.437\nour Certified Cloud Security Professional\nseries and I did get it right that time.\n\n00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:28.228\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor and\n\n00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:31.603\nlend his expertise on that topic is\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:32.417\nAdam, welcome back, sir.\n\n00:00:32.417 --> 00:00:32.945\nHow's it going?\n\n00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:34.774\n>> A legend in your own mind you are.\n\n00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:38.224\nI'm running to move forward\nconstant in the cloud.\n\n00:00:38.224 --> 00:00:40.337\nI'm backstroking through the cloud,\nas we go.\n\n00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:41.597\nLook, look, no hands.\n\n00:00:41.597 --> 00:00:44.519\n>> Peter Pan.\nNo feet., I'm standing.\n\n00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:45.941\nBut there are no feet, cuz there's no mat.\n\n00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.293\nAnyway, I'll get back to what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:50.148\nIt's the end of the day,\nwe're getting silly.\n\n00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:54.280\nSo we have to keep talking about secure\napplication development in the cloud and\n\n00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.499\nthink about using verified\nsecure software, and identity.\n\n00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.780\nAnd access management,\nwhich is an activity and\n\n00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.185\na topic that we love to talk about here\nwith regards of risks in the cloud.\n\n00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:05.889\nComes up yet\nagain in many of the topics we have.\n\n00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:08.634\nWhen we think about using\nsecure verified software,\n\n00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:10.714\nwe've talk a lot about API's already.\n\n00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:13.237\nWe circle back to this idea yet again.\n\n00:01:13.237 --> 00:01:18.500\nYou're using approved API's is so\nimportant, so critical for us to consider.\n\n00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.436\nThe challenge for\nthe cloud security provider and\n\n00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:23.288\nthe cloud security professional,\nboth and the customer.\n\n00:01:23.288 --> 00:01:26.940\nAll three is what equals approved.\n\n00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.344\nWho approves it who says,\nthe API is valid?\n\n00:01:29.344 --> 00:01:30.662\nIs it the security provider?\n\n00:01:30.662 --> 00:01:33.992\nIs it the cloud provider,\nin other words, that is doing that?\n\n00:01:33.992 --> 00:01:36.280\nIs it the customer that approves APIs?\n\n00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.859\nTypically not.\n\n00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.665\nIs it the provider?\n\n00:01:38.665 --> 00:01:40.519\nMore often than not.\n\n00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:44.264\nAnd if they are approving it, but they\ndon't necessarily explain to us why, how,\n\n00:01:44.264 --> 00:01:46.527\nwhen, who and\nall the things associated with it.\n\n00:01:46.527 --> 00:01:47.969\nHow do we as the customer know?\n\n00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:50.148\nAnd how do we know that\napproved equals secure?\n\n00:01:50.148 --> 00:01:52.821\nBecause approved doesn't\nalways equal secure,\n\n00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:55.694\napproved simply equals,\nessentially authorized.\n\n00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:58.800\nValid, but\nthat doesn't always mean secure.\n\n00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.146\nAnd so, there's a lot of issues\nassociated with the use of APIs.\n\n00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:04.600\nThey are insecure code\nlibraries that exist out there.\n\n00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.121\nAnd if the coding is not done correctly,\n\n00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:09.938\nwe've already established in prior\nepisodes that this can lead to risk and\n\n00:02:09.938 --> 00:02:13.346\nultimately to threat and\nvulnerability and we may have exposure.\n\n00:02:13.346 --> 00:02:16.770\nWe may have web application\nbased vulnerabilities,\n\n00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.182\nthe top ten list from OAuth or\nwherever we may look for those.\n\n00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:23.966\nAnd we may see concerns, especially for\nthings like injection attacks,\n\n00:02:23.966 --> 00:02:27.994\ncross site request forgery,\ncross site scripting attacks.\n\n00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:29.905\nXSS and XXRF and injection attacks and\n\n00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:33.260\nall sorts of other things that we\nwould have to be concerned about.\n\n00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.910\nSo, we really have to\nthink about this right.\n\n00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.901\nProgramatic control and access, automation\nintegration with third party tools.\n\n00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.532\nThese are all the benefits that\npotentially exist with the use of APIs,\n\n00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:47.754\nbut they're also potentially\ndetriments that exist as well.\n\n00:02:47.754 --> 00:02:50.865\nThe APIs are not vetted and\nare not created securely.\n\n00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:54.596\nThe consumption of APIs if done\nincorrectly can lead to an insecure\n\n00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:57.710\nenvironment, we have to think about this.\n\n00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.490\nSo for instance, when I go in and\n\n00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.620\nI use Office 365 as I do for my business.\n\n00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.527\nI am the tenant manager of\na many of the Office 365 real\n\n00:03:09.527 --> 00:03:12.378\nestate items that we have going on.\n\n00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:16.490\nWe've got about six or seven under the\ndifferent names we do business with and\n\n00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.280\nplus for many of my customers, I advise\nthem on how to use the platform securely.\n\n00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.200\nWhen I login, I'm able to actually\ngo in and to see the organizational\n\n00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.173\ndashboard if you will for Office 365 that\nis the tenant admin I have rights to.\n\n00:03:32.173 --> 00:03:36.846\nAnd because of that, I can login and\nI can see all the service updates.\n\n00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:38.693\nI can see all the open tickets.\n\n00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:41.450\nI can see the users that are in there.\n\n00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.470\nI can see the state of licensing.\n\n00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.930\nThe consumption of services,\nlook at reporting,\n\n00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.391\nlook at all the different things\nthat are associated with that.\n\n00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:54.722\nBut I do so through a web API, as all of\nus do if we use this kind of a service.\n\n00:03:54.722 --> 00:03:58.528\nWhen I login, when I am doing that, I'm\njust going to actually not show it to you,\n\n00:03:58.528 --> 00:04:00.290\nbut I am going to just pull it up.\n\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.644\nSo I can talk to you about it while\nwe're talking on my screen here, but\n\n00:04:03.644 --> 00:04:04.329\nI use HTTPS.\n\n00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.979\nI'm using a secure version of Web Access\nthrough the API that Microsoft provides.\n\n00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.884\nThey've got their URL there.\n\n00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:16.619\nI'm using Internet Explorer right now, but\nI could just as easily be using Chrome and\n\n00:04:16.619 --> 00:04:19.468\nI'm able to access it with\nChrome with no trouble.\n\n00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:22.815\nIt actually looks essentially the same,\nit works essentially the same way and\n\n00:04:22.815 --> 00:04:23.634\nis just as secure.\n\n00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:28.340\nWhen I do those things and\nI'm actually accessing and\n\n00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.117\nbeing able to get in with a secure API,\neverything hopefully works well.\n\n00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:38.475\nI can look at the certificate chain and\nlook at the trust associated with that,\n\n00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:41.184\nand I can validate that\nI'm logged in securely,\n\n00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:44.750\nand I can know beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that I'm going to be able\n\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.130\nto rely on the security\nassociated with this connection.\n\n00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.709\nBut if I'm using an insecure API, if I'm\nnot using a web API that has been offered\n\n00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:56.785\nby the vendor and is validated,\nI may not have that sense of security,\n\n00:04:56.785 --> 00:05:00.269\nthat sense of well-being that\nI need to have as a customer.\n\n00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:04.675\nAnd ultimately, as a security\nprofessional to allow this to occur.\n\n00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:09.220\nSo when I deal with web providers,\nwhen I deal with cloud providers and\n\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.530\nweb app providers,\n\n00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.401\nyou wanna first things we ask as a\ncustomer is what APIs are you supporting?\n\n00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:18.655\nPlease give us an authorized list\nof APIs you want us to use, so\n\n00:05:18.655 --> 00:05:21.673\nwe understand how to connect\nsecurely to your platform.\n\n00:05:21.673 --> 00:05:24.146\nIt's very important for\nmy customers to know that.\n\n00:05:24.146 --> 00:05:26.548\nBecause that way, if Firefox, for\n\n00:05:26.548 --> 00:05:30.640\ninstance is on the list and\nSafari is not as an Apple browser.\n\n00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.422\nThen if we use Safari or at least if we\nattempt to use Safari while we may get\n\n00:05:34.422 --> 00:05:38.180\ngood results and may be able to connect,\nwe should be aware of the fact\n\n00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.235\nthat we're connecting with a non-supported\napplication interface that may or\n\n00:05:42.235 --> 00:05:44.422\nmay not render and use the API correctly.\n\n00:05:44.422 --> 00:05:47.460\nAnd that's a risk, and\nwe have to document that risk, and\n\n00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.330\nthat's a liability that the organization\nmay or may not want to take on.\n\n00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.348\nWe may look at that and say, unacceptable.\n\n00:05:52.348 --> 00:05:55.664\nWe have a usage policy that says,\nonly these browsers.\n\n00:05:55.664 --> 00:06:00.392\nThese applications are supported, because\nwe're worried about the secure application\n\n00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:02.516\nof that API correctly to the interface.\n\n00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:05.688\nThis is very important for\nus as CCSPs to understand.\n\n00:06:05.688 --> 00:06:09.468\n>> So Adam, the approval comes from\nthe internal entity itself and\n\n00:06:09.468 --> 00:06:12.624\nnot necessarily some third\nparty approving entity.\n\n00:06:12.624 --> 00:06:13.967\n>> Well, it depends.\n\n00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:15.866\nSo the approval can come from both places,\n\n00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:18.624\nit depends on the nature of\nthe APM what we're talking about.\n\n00:06:18.624 --> 00:06:22.990\nSo if you remember one of our prior\nepisodes, I asked you to go out and\n\n00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.358\nlook up XAML and look up OAuth and\nwe went to for XAML,\n\n00:06:26.358 --> 00:06:30.136\nspecifically went to the XAML,\nXML org site and we saw it.\n\n00:06:30.136 --> 00:06:33.140\nI mentioned that Oasis was\nthe group right kinda behind that,\n\n00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.376\nthat group that is the industry\ngroup that manages that standard,\n\n00:06:36.376 --> 00:06:38.948\nputs out all the information,\ncoordinates it all.\n\n00:06:38.948 --> 00:06:42.480\nThey're not approving quote,\nunquote, the API directly.\n\n00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.297\nBut what they are doing is offering\nthe information, the coordination and\n\n00:06:47.297 --> 00:06:51.274\nthe maintenance of the standards\nthat lead to OAuth or XACML or\n\n00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:53.429\nXAML or OpenID or whatever it is.\n\n00:06:53.429 --> 00:06:55.600\nPick your trade group, whatever it may be.\n\n00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.117\nBut ultimately,\n\n00:06:56.117 --> 00:07:00.204\nthey are putting out the standard\nthat then is either used directly to\n\n00:07:00.204 --> 00:07:04.930\nimplement the API or is used as reference\nto build the secure APIs to align with.\n\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.202\nSo, they are definitely a third party.\n\n00:07:07.202 --> 00:07:09.745\nIn this case,\nplaying a part in that in some respects.\n\n00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:15.910\nThen you add in vendors that are providing\nweb services billed with those standards.\n\n00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.130\nSo whether it's Microsoft,\nwhether its Google whether it's Amazon,\n\n00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.980\nwhoever they are.\n\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.938\nThey're gonna add their two\ncents in essentially and\n\n00:07:22.938 --> 00:07:26.158\nthen they're gonna provide,\nessentially a certified or\n\n00:07:26.158 --> 00:07:29.305\nauthorized vision of that\nAPI to their customers.\n\n00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:33.348\nYou use this browser with this\nweb address and this port map and\n\n00:07:33.348 --> 00:07:35.389\nwhatever and we support that.\n\n00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.789\nWe don't support as we were just saying\nmaybe let's not pick on Apple, cuz it's\n\n00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:42.100\nbeen a long day and I've already picked\non your Apple choice a couple of times.\n\n00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.278\nSo let's say, Firefox is not supported.\n\n00:07:44.278 --> 00:07:45.374\nSo, Safari is.\n\n00:07:45.374 --> 00:07:48.296\nSo, we may or\nmay not want Safari to be used.\n\n00:07:48.296 --> 00:07:50.827\nWe may have other options, but\nit's on the authorized list.\n\n00:07:50.827 --> 00:07:52.448\nSo at least we know if it is used,\n\n00:07:52.448 --> 00:07:55.344\nit's used securely whereas\nFirefox should not be used.\n\n00:07:55.344 --> 00:07:59.276\nSo, we now have the vendor playing\na part and adding their part in.\n\n00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:03.366\nAnd then we also have to create a policy\nas the customer, if we're smart anyway.\n\n00:08:03.366 --> 00:08:08.127\nAnd we are risk-adverse, and we are doing\nour job as CCSPs, we would educate and\n\n00:08:08.127 --> 00:08:10.927\nhopefully encourage,\npolitely encourage and\n\n00:08:10.927 --> 00:08:16.500\nperhaps coerce if they're not paying\nattention, our customer, our organization.\n\n00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:21.400\nTo draft a policy that will implement\nultimately through process and procedure\n\n00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.730\nthe standardization of the consumption\nof that API that is supported and\n\n00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.390\nis deemed to be secure by the third\nparty's standards organization.\n\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.180\nAnd the vendor both have kinda\nadded their two cents in right,\n\n00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.300\nand come up with this solution.\n\n00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.340\nWe're now gonna consume that, and\nwe're gonna mandate that consumption, and\n\n00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.700\ncoordinate that from the governance and\na compliance perspective.\n\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.409\nSo it takes a village, right,\n[LAUGH] if you think about it this way.\n\n00:08:45.409 --> 00:08:47.716\nIt takes a village to add\nall these moving parts in.\n\n00:08:47.716 --> 00:08:50.800\nNow, is it always done that way?\n\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:50.930\nIt may or may not be.\n\n00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.820\nDo we really acknowledge\nthe fact that Oasis or\n\n00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.230\nwhatever the group is behind\na certain standard has put it out?\n\n00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:58.720\nWe probably, as the consumer,\n\n00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.210\nunless we're an educated consumer, a cloud\nsecurity professional such as any of you,\n\n00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.510\nan IT professional such as Daniel or\nmyself or whoever, any of you also out\n\n00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.000\nthere that may be listening to this if you\nfall into one or more of those categories.\n\n00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000\nWe may be knowledgable enough to know,\nright?\n\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.900\nBut the reality is the customers you had,\nthe individual users,\n\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.540\nthe farm bureau years ago.\n\n00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.280\nDid most of them know much\nabout the technology other than\n\n00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.110\nyou told them this is how they use it and\nthis is what they do?\n\n00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.850\nI'm guessing, I'm guessing, probably not.\n\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.670\nYou're shaking you're head.\n\n00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.820\n>> You guessed right, you're shaking\nyour head yes, vigorously off camera.\n\n00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.980\nSo, chances are good probably not, right?\n\n00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.900\nSo does the average customer, does the\naverage consumer of a cloud service really\n\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:36.890\nget all the things we just described?\n\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.360\nThey just know, right?\n\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.660\nThe only thing they do know is\nthat it works when it works, and\n\n00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:42.140\nit doesn't when it doesn't right?\n\n00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.910\nRemember, the customer wants simplicity.\n\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:48.790\nThe customer wants lack of risk,\nand lack of acceptance of risk, and\n\n00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.140\njust functionality.\n\n00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.700\nThey just wanna know that it works.\n\n00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.240\nThey don't wanna accept risk,\nthey don't wanna be told all the issues.\n\n00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.550\nThey just want simplicity,\nthat's what they want.\n\n00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:03.980\nIt's our job as CCSPs, as IT admins,\nas the infrastructure managers,\n\n00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.770\nas the vendors, as the authorizers,\nas the third party,\n\n00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.410\noverarching standards bodies, whatever\nthey are, all the mixed elements in there\n\n00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.420\nto actually play our part but\nto do so behind the scenes.\n\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.130\nSo we're kind of like the Greek chorus\nin the sense that you don't see us.\n\n00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:24.220\nWe all have masks on.\n\n00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.200\nYou hear our voices,\nbut it's all communal.\n\n00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.480\nAnd ultimately, what the heroine or the\nvillain sees in the tragedy in the play,\n\n00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.520\nand hears in the play, is the cacophony of\nvoices, but can't really pick out any one.\n\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:40.695\nI'm probably being way too literal and\ndramatic with my interpretation here.\n\n00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:41.720\n>> [LAUGH] It's like a greek drama.\n\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.960\n>> This is greek literature 101.\n\n00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.380\nWelcome to the the extension of ITProTV.\n\n00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.370\nHere, we're talking about\ngreek tragedy tonight.\n\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.350\nSo you know we're not actually seeing\nthe breakdown right, to your point.\n\n00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.480\nIt's valid and\nvery important to understand it but\n\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:57.120\nwe really don't see that breakdown\nfrom the customers perspective.\n\n00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.430\nWe don't want to, by the way,\nwe don't want to know.\n\n00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.450\nAll the customer wants to know is that\nit works, what the security professional\n\n00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:06.130\nwants to know is the details you've\nasked us to sketch and to describe.\n\n00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:09.710\nSo it's very important for the security\nprofessional to have that vision.\n\n00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.980\nBut it's not gonna get,\n\n00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.900\ntypically anyway, not gonna get\ntranslated down to the customer.\n\n00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:18.540\nI start talking about that stuff with\nmy customers, and eyes glaze over.\n\n00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:20.480\nThey're just like wow,\nthat's so interesting.\n\n00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.370\nSo hey, we gotta go, and\nyou've got a meeting, and we've got stuff,\n\n00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.700\nwe don't know what, but\nwe've got stuff we've gotta do.\n\n00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.500\nSo you gotta go, right, [LAUGH] cuz\nthey don't wanna know that stuff.\n\n00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.130\nThey're just, they get bored and\nthey just don't get it.\n\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.200\nAnd when they don't get it, bad things\nhappen cuz then they think that they can't\n\n00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.300\nunderstand it so then they actually ignore\nit, which is worse than them doing it but\n\n00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.500\nnot knowing what it is, so\nat least in my book anyway.\n\n00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.760\nI found that's the case.\n\n00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.540\nSo I think benevolent rule\nthrough ignorance is better\n\n00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:49.920\nthan knowledgable rule and then\nmisunderstanding on the customer's part.\n\n00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.685\n>> What they don't know won't hurt me,\nright?\n\n00:11:51.685 --> 00:11:52.590\n[LAUGH]\n>> What they don't know\n\n00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.690\ndoesn't cause me concern cuz I\ndon't have to fix their problems so\n\n00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.720\nI\n>> I like that approach a lot.\n\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.780\nWhen we think about this we also\nbroaden out this discussion,\n\n00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.510\nwe've talked about this as well already,\nwith supply chain management.\n\n00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.690\nI've talked a lot about managing risk\nthrough the supply chain by inheriting\n\n00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.190\nthe risk of your suppliers and\nidentifying and understanding that.\n\n00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.860\nRemember that software typically, while\nit may be built internally at one site,\n\n00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.100\nthrough one company, may be made up\nof parts from different entities.\n\n00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.750\nYou have software libraries.\n\n00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.700\nThat may or may not belong to the company\nthat is building the software.\n\n00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.180\nMeaning they may be developing on.\n\n00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.290\nWhat did you say things Ruby and\nPython and C#.\n\n00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:35.710\nAnd, I don't know, ASP.net and\nthe dot-net framework and who knows what.\n\n00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.620\nYour going to bring in all\nthese different languages and\n\n00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.550\nyou may not control them as the vendor.\n\n00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.920\nYou may just consume them.\n\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.650\nAnd I'm not implying for a minute that\nthose languages are or are not secure.\n\n00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.520\nI'm just pointing out to you that there\nare well known insecure library concerns\n\n00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.520\nwith C, the C language and\nthat if you develop\n\n00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.120\nusing the wrong set of libraries and not\nthe secure functions of those libraries,\n\n00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:01.810\nthen you're gonna write code that is gonna\nsuffer from a whole host of liabilities.\n\n00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:05.890\nAnd so it may be beyond the control of\nthe customer to see into the code and\n\n00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:06.810\nunderstand that.\n\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.460\nIt's up to the developer, and so\n\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.580\nessentially we're dealing\nwith supply chain here.\n\n00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.250\nAnd if we don't manage supply\nchain risk appropriately,\n\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.320\nthen we're gonna have issues and concerns.\n\n00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.200\nWe may package that software up and\n\n00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.730\nthen send it out into the world As\nthe owner of the software, but if we\n\n00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:24.740\ndon't control the distribution chain,\nsomebody may interdict that software and\n\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.690\nmodify it without our knowledge, and\nthat can also prove to be a challenge.\n\n00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.520\nAgain, I'm not suggesting that happens.\n\n00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.800\nI'm just pointing out that it could.\n\n00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.200\nAnd I just wanna make sure you understand\nthat as a CCSP, we have to be focused\n\n00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.378\non and worried about these concerns, and\nhave to figure out how to address them.\n\n00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:44.990\nI saw 27034,27034 information\ntechnology security techniques,\n\n00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:49.100\nfour application security part one.\n\n00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.830\nThat's enough for sale, that three times.\n\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:56.490\nThat is gonna sale that we're\ngonna look to for guidance and\n\n00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.380\nif we can go Daniel's desktop you've got\nthat I believe up and running force.\n\n00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.780\nWe'll the ISO standard there.\n\n00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.590\nI've told you at several\npoints in different sessions,\n\n00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.600\nwe talked about how ISO standards\ncome about, where to find them.\n\n00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.480\nYou know that there is a preview button,\nI think, down there on the right.\n\n00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.550\nWe're not gonna click on it, but\njust to let people know where it is,\n\n00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:17.300\nthat they can go look at and\nsee the listing of the standard.\n\n00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.300\nMost of it is gonna be masked.\n\n00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.250\nYou're not gonna be able to see\nall of it unless you buy it.\n\n00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.740\nThat's the one downside with many of the\nISO standards, you do have to pay money to\n\n00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:27.240\nget them but for business that wanna refer\nto them they will certainly go out and\n\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.280\nbuy them, but as a security professional\nwe should at least be aware of them and\n\n00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.360\nthis is one of the ones\nthat's very important.\n\n00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.250\nYou could see it is gonna be\na dash one meaning part one.\n\n00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.810\nAnd it is gonna have colon and\nthen a year designation in this\n\n00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:46.170\ncase 2011 which is the last time the\nstandard was either updated or put out.\n\n00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.950\nThis standard may be updated over time and\ncertainly many of them,\n\n00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.570\nthey tend to have anywhere from a three\nto six to eight year lifecycle so\n\n00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.880\nthey don't always get updated as often as\nwe may think they need to be in the field\n\n00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.410\nbut the reality is we should probably\nsee an update to that standard.\n\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.300\nin 2016 or 2017 or 2018 most likely so\n\n00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.690\nin the next several years we are most\nlikely to see an update to that.\n\n00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.840\nThe year designation we will updated and\nwe will see something like colon 2018 and\n\n00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.290\nthat will mean the most recent\nstandard of that moment in time.\n\n00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.290\nSo this particular standard is gonna help\nus to define the concepts framework and\n\n00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:23.300\nprocesses ultimately that are gonna\nbe used to help organization\n\n00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.800\nintegrate security with the NSTLC.\n\n00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.200\nThis is the secure part of\nthe secure SDLC, in other words.\n\n00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.960\nThis by itself doesn't do that, but\n\n00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.870\nit provides the guidance\nthat helps us to do that.\n\n00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.100\nSo we do want to understand this\nmay be a reference point for us.\n\n00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:41.200\nWe'll return to this in a future episode,\nand delve much more deeply into this, and\n\n00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.440\ntalk about some of the guidance\nthat's in there the ONF and the ANF.\n\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.556\nAnd we'll take a look at\nsome of those things,\n\n00:15:46.556 --> 00:15:48.415\nthe operational normative framework.\n\n00:15:48.415 --> 00:15:51.920\nThose things, and what they are, and\nhow they provide guidance to us, but\n\n00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:52.636\nthat'll be in an upcoming conversation.\n\n00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:54.472\nWe'll be dealing with\nthat a little bit later.\n\n00:15:54.472 --> 00:15:56.911\nWe also want to think about\nopen source software.\n\n00:15:56.911 --> 00:16:00.568\nCommunal based software where\na community is developing that.\n\n00:16:00.568 --> 00:16:04.502\nLinux is a great example of Open Source\nsoftware where lots of individuals\n\n00:16:04.502 --> 00:16:07.330\ncontribute to the creation\nof the software.\n\n00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.210\nThe idea behind it is that lots and\nlots of eyes on a system\n\n00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:14.970\ndealing with the problems and the concerns\nare more likely to find these issues and\n\n00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.190\nfix them, then proprietary software\nwe call closed sourced software.\n\n00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.320\nThe Microsoft Windows,\nthe Microsoft Office, the VMware,\n\n00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.260\nESXIs of the world which\nare proprietary closed systems\n\n00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.170\nthat are owned by one vendor and\nare maintained by them.\n\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:32.200\nAnd essentially are developed by them, but\n\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.650\nreally without any functional knowledge\nof what the code base looks like and\n\n00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.980\nwhat it is, at least to the outside world,\nto the average consumer.\n\n00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.100\nAs a result of that,\n\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.730\nthere may be a lot of liabilities sitting\nin that code that we're just not aware of.\n\n00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.310\nReference the fact that every one of those\nvendors puts out patches to their systems\n\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.360\non a consistent and\n\n00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.300\nregular basis throughout the year\nupdating and adding functionality and\n\n00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.540\nchanging and modifying parameters to\naddress security concerns threats and\n\n00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:01.420\nvulnerabilities that are uncovered during\nthe course of the normal operations.\n\n00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.420\nMeaning we are constantly finding\nconcerns in these software programs but\n\n00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:09.580\nwe may not be aware of them until the\nvendor identifies them when they're closed\n\n00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.810\nwhereas in Open Source,\nnot that software has any more or\n\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.380\nany less issues then close-source software\ndoes, but they tend to be found quicker.\n\n00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.310\nAnd we tend to know about them more\nreadily, because it's a communal effort.\n\n00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.880\nAnd there are no secrets, so to speak,\neverybody can look at the code.\n\n00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.645\nSee what's in there and\nif they're interested.\n\n00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:30.385\nJust have the time and the inclination to\ngo dig in they can take a look at it for\n\n00:17:30.385 --> 00:17:31.275\nthemselves.\n\n00:17:31.275 --> 00:17:34.985\nAnd as a result we tend to have\ncertainly a lot of software and\n\n00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:37.505\nsecurity vulnerabilities\nin Open Source software but\n\n00:17:37.505 --> 00:17:41.785\nwe tend to patch them very quickly and\noverall it tends to be considered\n\n00:17:41.785 --> 00:17:46.295\nto be as secure and in most cases more\nsecure than close source software is.\n\n00:17:46.295 --> 00:17:48.600\nSo from that perspective well,\n\n00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.326\nwe don't always have an option and\nwe don't always have a choice.\n\n00:17:51.326 --> 00:17:55.640\nThe smart security provider,\nthe smart security professional\n\n00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.850\nlooks to understand how to balance those\nneeds in the organization with the ability\n\n00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:03.470\nto patch manage and ultimately the ability\nto manage threat and vulnerabilities.\n\n00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.550\nI'm not suggesting for a minute that\nmeans we switch away from Microsoft and\n\n00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:11.800\nVMware and from CISCO and Citrix, and\nall the other closed source vendors\n\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:16.430\nto open sourcing as a solution of panacea\nthat will solve every security problem.\n\n00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:17.470\nQuite the opposite.\n\n00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:21.210\nWe'll probably create a lot more than\nwe already have today in the short run\n\n00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:25.540\nbecause that switchover, that rip and\nreplace is gonna be so catastrophic and so\n\n00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.870\ndisruptive that we're gonna open our\nsystems up to even more security concerns.\n\n00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.420\nIn the long term, it remains to be seen\nwhether that would be good choice or not.\n\n00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.670\nI'm not the one that should\nmake that decision for you and\n\n00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.100\nI'm not the one that can forecast\nahead as to what that will look like.\n\n00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.770\nBut I can tell you that I've customers\nthat host on both platforms widely.\n\n00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.950\nI've talked about it in some other\nepisodes a fact that web server hosting\n\n00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:49.660\ntends to heavily favored in\nthe Linux area, the Linux Unix area.\n\n00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.200\nThat web service traditionally\nrun in that platform more.\n\n00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.110\nAnd they tend to run very well.\n\n00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.870\nThat infrastructure management tends to\nbe done on closed source systems like\n\n00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.940\nMicrosoft like VMWare\nlike Citrix like Cisco.\n\n00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:06.100\nThat tends to run and run well but\nit's vendor specific and proprietary and\n\n00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:09.450\nyou take essentially the risk\nassociated with that approach.\n\n00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.940\nSo be an educated security professional.\n\n00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:16.390\nMake good choices, manage risks\nappropriately in your organizations.\n\n00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.470\nUnderstand the value as well as the\nliability of making a choice and then make\n\n00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:24.250\nthe business case and let the business\ndecide ultimately where they want to be.\n\n00:19:24.250 --> 00:19:27.660\nBut make sure you explain the facts to\nthem in such a way that it helps them\n\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.760\nto understand.\n\n00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.630\nAnd then flip a coin\nlike everybody else does.\n\n00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.740\nAnd decide heads you go, tails you don't.\n\n00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.890\nRight, and that's simply how we do this.\n\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:34.750\nBut don't tell anybody.\n\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.750\nYou're not supposed to know.\n\n00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.500\nWe actually make it sound a lot\nmore impressive than it really is.\n\n00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.150\nCould you imagine people standing around?\n\n00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.000\nOkay, what are you gonna run this week?\n\n00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.800\nYou flip a coin.\n\n00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.810\nOkay Microsoft.\n\n00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:44.863\nWow look we're switching to Linux.\n\n00:19:44.863 --> 00:19:46.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Can you imagine if you ran your\n\n00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.260\nbusiness that way?\n\n00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:47.930\nJust how crazy that would be?\n\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.379\n>> I'm pretty convinced\nthat they actually do.\n\n00:19:49.379 --> 00:19:51.966\n[LAUGH]\n>> It very well may be the case in some\n\n00:19:51.966 --> 00:19:52.637\nbusinesses.\n\n00:19:52.637 --> 00:19:54.124\n>> Like you said it's all hushed and\nlow tones.\n\n00:19:54.124 --> 00:19:55.695\n>> We don't talk about that.\n\n00:19:55.695 --> 00:19:57.530\n>> Shh, you're not supposed to\nsay anything outside the room.\n\n00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.230\nRemember, it's in the door, or\nbehind the door in the closed room.\n\n00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:03.760\nBut imagine for a minute if you\nactually ran a business that way.\n\n00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.640\nRight, today's Monday, today's Linux day.\n\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.410\nIt's Wednesday,\nwe're switching to Microsoft.\n\n00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.150\nThat would just be so crazy.\n\n00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:12.380\nAnd yet essentially, right,\nif we don't make these choices correctly.\n\n00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.500\nThat maybe where we find ourselves\nat certain periods of time.\n\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.280\nSo don't be that person.\n\n00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:17.510\nNo matter what happens.\n\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.670\nRight, so we also want to talk a bit, in\nthis episode, about designing appropriate\n\n00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:24.950\nidentity in access management solutions\nover viewing the concept of IM again.\n\n00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:29.550\nWe've already talked about it in depth in\nsome other of our episodes in other areas\n\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:32.800\nwith the infrastructure, the cloud\nsecurity conversation on infrastructure.\n\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.550\nWe spoke extensively about identity and\naccess management.\n\n00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.200\nBut a different take on it here.\n\n00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.950\nNot the infrastructure piece or\nthe application security piece.\n\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:44.330\nHow do we use IM to drive secure\ndevelopment, secure application usage and\n\n00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.290\nauthentication in the platform to\nallow for authorized access but\n\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.600\nblock unauthorized access.\n\n00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.100\nThis is a very good challenge for\nus and identity and\n\n00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.690\naccess management has to be thought\nabout from this perspective.\n\n00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.800\nThe systems themselves that we use have\nto be developed, they have to have\n\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:03.350\nfunctionality that makes sense to us so\nthings like self service password resets.\n\n00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:08.750\nUser registration, we have to be able to\nbe essentially manage users to reporting\n\n00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.360\nand these are all things\nwe have to worry about,\n\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:13.740\nwe have to think about on the identity\nside, you'll those kinds of systems,\n\n00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.380\nprovisioning, password management,\nregistration etc.\n\n00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:21.840\nOn the access side excuse me on\nthe access side authentication,\n\n00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.890\nauthorization, federation,\n\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.170\npolicy management are all concerns we\nbring them together with an identity and\n\n00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:33.170\naccess management security overlay,\nsome sort of central software package, and\n\n00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:38.600\nwe have a repository for identity\ninformation typically an ldap directory.\n\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.170\nThen we have a completely\nfunctioning system, or\n\n00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:44.890\na complete functioning system, but we\nhave to think about all the moving parts.\n\n00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.798\nSomebody's gotta build all this\nstuff right we don't just say\n\n00:21:46.798 --> 00:21:48.787\nyeah wouldn't it be great if we\nhad that and suddenly it happens.\n\n00:21:48.787 --> 00:21:52.505\nSomebody's gotta go out and say yeah we\nneed that and this is what we're gonna do\n\n00:21:52.505 --> 00:21:56.333\nto build it and by the way we're gonna\nbuild it securely, and by the way we're\n\n00:21:56.333 --> 00:22:00.108\ngonna make it interoperable and by the\nway, you're gonna pay us this amount of\n\n00:22:00.108 --> 00:22:03.200\nmoney for that [LAUGH] right\nbecause that stuff isn't cheap.\n\n00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.470\nSo somebody has to come up with that.\n\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.220\nSo think about, for instance,\nthe ideas behind federation.\n\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.440\nAnd federated identity management,\nwe call FIT.\n\n00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.903\nKim Federated Identity Management.\n\n00:22:11.903 --> 00:22:16.497\nThe idea of being able to go out and\nprovide policies and processing in systems\n\n00:22:16.497 --> 00:22:21.232\nthat allows us to extend trust out to\npartners, vendors, whatever you may call\n\n00:22:21.232 --> 00:22:26.179\nthem other entities that we are going to\nessentially bring in beyond the protective\n\n00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:30.231\nborder, the external boundary of\nthe enclave into our trust zone.\n\n00:22:30.231 --> 00:22:34.656\nAnd allow them operate inside there\nas trusted members of our enclave.\n\n00:22:34.656 --> 00:22:38.531\nWe're extending our trust to them and\nthey to us, in return, cuz typically,\n\n00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:42.173\nfederation winds up being, although\nit can always be a one way solution,\n\n00:22:42.173 --> 00:22:45.987\nit may very well be a two way solution,\nwhere I may trust you, as a vendor, and\n\n00:22:45.987 --> 00:22:47.410\nyou may also trust me.\n\n00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.900\nSo I can access your real time\nonline provisioning system for\n\n00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.670\njust in time ordering, and I give\nyou access to my inventory system so\n\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.600\nthat the two can,\nessentially, communicate.\n\n00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.420\nAnd when I put an order in, you can\nvalidate that to make sure I haven't\n\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.780\nmissed anything, and\nthat I've ordered enough.\n\n00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.830\nAnd you can self-correct and autocorrect\nthat so that the inventory matches.\n\n00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.900\nAnd I've always got pre-determined\nlevels of what I want.\n\n00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.840\nAnd you make sure I have that on-hand.\n\n00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.890\nAnd this is what's done in\na lot of systems today.\n\n00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.953\n>> So it becomes collaborative.\n\n00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:14.686\nIt can.\n\n00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:18.346\n>> A good way to think about it it becomes\ncollaboration and federation typically\n\n00:23:18.346 --> 00:23:22.228\nimplies collaboration at some level but\nwe're gonna be doing these things in order\n\n00:23:22.228 --> 00:23:25.580\nto be able to make sure that we\nare extending trust to both parties.\n\n00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.910\nThe supply vendor has to trust\nme to come into their CRM or\n\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.610\nnot the CRM system rather their ERP\nsystem, their inventory management and\n\n00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.190\nordering system, at least the front end\nof it anyway that their customer sees.\n\n00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.840\nAnd I as the customer have\nto trust them to come in and\n\n00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.280\nlook at my inventory database,\nwhatever my ERP equivalent it.\n\n00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:46.590\nAnd I have to give each other, we have\nto give each other access that we can\n\n00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.600\nessentially collaborate how this\ncommunication taking place.\n\n00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.835\nBut it's about extending trust so\nwe have to think about this.\n\n00:23:51.835 --> 00:23:53.476\nWe use standards typically to do this.\n\n00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.500\nWe've mentioned SAML several times,\nquery research and\n\n00:23:56.489 --> 00:23:58.156\nmarkup language is used by far.\n\n00:23:58.156 --> 00:24:02.650\nProbably the most commonly accepted\nstandard today in our industry to do this.\n\n00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.858\nWe also use WS-Federation, Web Service\nFederation, OpenID we've mentioned,\n\n00:24:06.858 --> 00:24:10.238\nOauth, Oauth 2,\nwe've mentioned a lot of these.\n\n00:24:10.238 --> 00:24:14.850\nThese are gonna be standards that are used\nfor identity and access management.\n\n00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.725\nAs a CCSP you should be aware of these\nstandards, you should know what they are.\n\n00:24:18.725 --> 00:24:20.549\nCan you, while we're talking?\n\n00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:22.790\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:23.847\n>> It's okay.\n\n00:24:23.847 --> 00:24:28.618\n>> [SOUND] Can you, while we're talking,\nGoogle WS-Federation?\n\n00:24:28.618 --> 00:24:30.890\nAnd when you have a link\nto the OASIS page.\n\n00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.910\nJust being that up, or let me know,\nand we'll bring that up real quick.\n\n00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.760\nI just want to show the good\npeople out there in our\n\n00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:39.530\naudience what that standard looks like.\n\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.780\nSo while we're waiting for\nthat to come up, you got that?\n\n00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.960\nSo can we take a look real quick?\n\n00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.150\nThere we go.\n\n00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:50.500\nSo when we take a look at WS-Federation\na later, excuse me, I'm gonna try again.\n\n00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.400\nAn earlier standard that came out before\nsome of the others we're talking about,\n\n00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.610\nbut you can see WS-Federation,\nweb service federation language\n\n00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.890\nis also used pretty common standard\nthat we often reference as well.\n\n00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:03.220\nAgain, through OASIS, OASIS is it's\ngonna be that glue on the back and\n\n00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.490\nit holds a lot of this stuff\ntogether in this area.\n\n00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.720\nSo wanna make sure you're\nfamiliar with this as well.\n\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.240\nYet another one that you just may wanna\nknow underneath the idea of identity in\n\n00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:12.410\naccess management.\n\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.740\nWe talk about identity providers and\nrelying parties.\n\n00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:20.640\nThe identity provider is gonna be\nthe provider or the entity that\n\n00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.860\nholds all the identities and generates\nthe token that identifies a known user.\n\n00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.370\nThat's the identity provider\nmay very well be, for instance,\n\n00:25:29.370 --> 00:25:32.560\nthe ADDS in Windows, the Microsoft\nActive Directory directory service,\n\n00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.190\nis the identity provider that's gonna\ngenerate the user identities and\n\n00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.400\nvalidate them that's what\nthat function will be.\n\n00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.200\nAnd then the relying party, what's called\nthe RP in the language of identity and\n\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.940\naccess management, is the service provider\nthat consumes those identity tokens\n\n00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.980\nto authenticate users and allow them in.\n\n00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.993\nSo the relying party may be the\nMicrosoft Azure fabric that's using that\n\n00:25:53.993 --> 00:25:59.105\ntoken to validate the user, to give\nthem access to services on the cloud.\n\n00:25:59.105 --> 00:26:00.811\nThat would be the relying party.\n\n00:26:00.811 --> 00:26:04.805\nIt's the service provider that consumes\nthe user identity to provide access.\n\n00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:08.545\nAs opposed to the identity provider\nthat actually creates the identity and\n\n00:26:08.545 --> 00:26:12.730\nvalidates it for the users so that they\ncan then use that or exchange that for\n\n00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.830\naccess to cloud services.\n\n00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.700\nSo we wanna make sure we\nunderstand the language here.\n\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:17.960\nAnd definitely understanding and\n\n00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.770\nhow to differentiate between identity,\nprovider and realigned party.\n\n00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:26.700\nUnderneath identity providers is a general\ncategory within the identity and\n\n00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:29.460\naccess management discussion,\nis gonna be very important for\n\n00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:32.470\nyou when you think about preparing for\nthe CSSP exam.\n\n00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.330\nWe also talk about single sign on.\n\n00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:40.160\nAccess all and authenticate once, right,\nlogin authenticate one time, access many.\n\n00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.360\nThink of it various ways.\n\n00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.530\nThe idea is that we are going to\nprovide our creditor up front.\n\n00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.460\nAnd once we've done that and authenticated\nit, we're not gonna then have to worry\n\n00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:50.390\nabout having to reauthenticate\ntypically to every system.\n\n00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.130\nWe're simply gonna present\na representation of that so\n\n00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.370\nthat we know that we\nare an authenticated user and\n\n00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:58.950\nthat we could resume those services\nonce we've authenticated in.\n\n00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.150\nThis generically is the idea of SSO or\nsingle sign on.\n\n00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.350\nWe use this all the time today.\n\n00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.700\nIn Windows we implement\nthis through Kerberos,\n\n00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:10.330\nin most web services, we use single\nsign on with Federation to validate and\n\n00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.820\nthen propagate it out to various systems.\n\n00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.730\nThis is very common in the cloud today.\n\n00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.138\nWe, as security professionals,\nneed to understand the value of SSO, but\n\n00:27:18.138 --> 00:27:20.950\nalso the architecture that goes\ninto building SSO systems and\n\n00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:23.730\nthe necessary requirements on\nthe back end to support them.\n\n00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:30.360\nThings like WS Federation, things like\nOpen ID, OLAF 2.0, XACML, XAML, etc.\n\n00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.828\nYou gotta know that these things\nare associated with an SSO environment and\n\n00:27:33.828 --> 00:27:35.445\nunderstand how they work.\n\n00:27:35.445 --> 00:27:39.150\nWhen we think about authenticating,\nwe've talked about single\n\n00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.470\nversus dual versus multi factor\nauthentication at various points.\n\n00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.100\nI've inserted this into conversations.\n\n00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.760\nIt's always relevant to talk about here\nwith identity and access management.\n\n00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:51.279\nRemember the idea's that we can\nauthenticate, that we can provide.\n\n00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.430\nThe vision of our identity, who we are,\nand represent that in a variety of ways.\n\n00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.470\nWe simply talk about\nthat three common ways,\n\n00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.400\nsomething we have, something we know,\nand something we are.\n\n00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.650\nAnd so when we think those acceptable\nways of identifying ourselves,\n\n00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.230\nwe're talking about factors\nof our identification.\n\n00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.345\nA single factor is one of those, dual\nfactor is two of the three, mix and match,\n\n00:28:14.345 --> 00:28:19.520\nmulti-factor sometimes incorrectly\nit's used to refer to both dual and\n\n00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.600\nall three being joined together.\n\n00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.300\nSo you will hear multi-factor when\npeople may really mean dual-factor.\n\n00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.100\nBut you hear multi-factor for\neither dual or all three.\n\n00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.460\nUp to you, mix and match.\n\n00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.580\nBut ultimately if all\nthree factors are used,\n\n00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.950\nit's considered multi-factor\nauthentication.\n\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.360\nSo I have no R, so let's quickly\ntalk about an example of each.\n\n00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.730\nSo if we have something, that could be\nsomething we have in our possession,\n\n00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:45.200\nit could be a smart card for instance\nthat we insert into a smartcard reader.\n\n00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.340\nThat would be a form or\nan identity factor with something we have.\n\n00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.650\nSomething we know, could be a PIN\nnumber that goes with the smart card.\n\n00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.780\nCould be a user name and\n\n00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:58.140\na password, it's something knowledge\nthat we have that we have to provide.\n\n00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:03.000\nAnd then if it's something we are,\nthat's a biometric solution of some kind.\n\n00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.780\nThat could be something like a iris scan\nor retina scan, something of that nature.\n\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.840\nThere's combinations of\nthose that can be used.\n\n00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.100\nWe can do a retina scan along\nwith a smart card swipe, right?\n\n00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:17.220\nSomething like that could be done for\ndual factor authentication.\n\n00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.460\nThe trick here is to\nunderstand couple of things.\n\n00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:21.890\nNumber one that, obviously,\nthe more factors for\n\n00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:26.900\nauthentication we provide, the stronger\nthe likelihood that the individual on\n\n00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.350\nthe far side of that equation is\nlegitimately who they claim to be.\n\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.200\nAnd therefore more likely that we're gonna\nvalidate a user that is an authorized user\n\n00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.350\nthat should be allowed in,\nless likely we'll get a bad after,\n\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.650\nis what I'm suggesting.\n\n00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:41.220\nDid you see, or have you seen,\nthe most recent Mission Impossible movie?\n\n00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.260\nCame out a year or more ago, now?\n\n00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.480\n>> No, I did not see that.\n\n00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.150\n>> Rogue Nation?\n\n00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:45.820\nRight, is that what it was?\n\n00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:46.850\n>> Yeah, I think I missed that one.\n\n00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.540\n>> So, interesting cuz in that movie,\nright,\n\n00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.680\nthey actually do a really\ncool thing with biometrics.\n\n00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.970\nSo at a certain point,\nwithout spoiling the entire plot, but\n\n00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.700\nat a certain point they've got\nthe IMF team has to sneak in to\n\n00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.340\na highly secure area to essentially,\nas they almost do in every movie,\n\n00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.900\nsteal some sort of information\nright somehow get something.\n\n00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.880\nAnd so they've gotta pretend to be\nsomebody they're not to authenticate in\n\n00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.440\nand essentially go in and trick the guards\nand the systems into giving them access.\n\n00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.210\nSo one of the guys has to\npretend to be this individual.\n\n00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:18.730\nAnd so they go through, they put\nthe mask on, they do the whole thing,\n\n00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:20.100\nright, they generate the mask.\n\n00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.700\nThey do the voice thing, all that.\n\n00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:24.430\nAnd then there's these varying levels of,\nor defense and\n\n00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:25.930\nthe players have to go through.\n\n00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:30.170\nAnd one them is, you have to go\nthrough a series of coded locks,\n\n00:30:30.170 --> 00:30:34.280\nlike chambers that you walk into,\nput some sort of code in, and\n\n00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.140\nif the code is right within\na certain amount of time,\n\n00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.570\nyou walk through to the next level and\nhave to do a variety of these things.\n\n00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:40.000\nThat's pretty straightforward.\n\n00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.150\nBut then after that, the last step in\nthe process is, you go through a biometric\n\n00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:47.930\nsystem where they don't just\nlike scan your eyes or whatever.\n\n00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:51.318\nThey actually will scan,\nthey call a gait scan.\n\n00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:52.500\nAnd a gait scan traditionally,\n\n00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.980\nreally is not like,\nhey look there's a gate scan through it.\n\n00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.300\nThey actually watch you walk and they've\nrecorded your walking and the way in which\n\n00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.980\nyou walk, your stride length,\nthe distance, the whole nine yards.\n\n00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.914\nAnd so this shows,\nit's actually really cool in the movie.\n\n00:31:04.914 --> 00:31:10.150\nSo they show you this thing working where\nthe guy gets to the last gate literally,\n\n00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.740\nand he has to walk down this tunnel,\nessentially.\n\n00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.460\nIt's like 30 feet long or whatever.\n\n00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.640\nAnd it's got the, it's like a full body\nscanner with cameras on either side and\n\n00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.880\nit's a frame that you walk in and\nyou essentially walk through and\n\n00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:23.880\nit tracks you.\n\n00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.890\nAnd they show the display as he's walking,\nso you actually see the x-ray\n\n00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:31.100\nversion of his legs going like this,\nand it's checking the gait.\n\n00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.620\nAnd if it doesn't work the right way,\nessentially he's done.\n\n00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.790\nHe's toasted, right?\n\n00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:38.850\nSo it's actually kinda cool cuz\nthey show this particular feature.\n\n00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.530\nAnd this is not something\nyou see every day.\n\n00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:44.800\nI mean, this exists, but this is a really\nhigh level, highly secure system.\n\n00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.800\nBut they actually showed a movie as\na biometric device, which is kinda cool.\n\n00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.100\nCuz you don't normally\nsee that very often,\n\n00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.660\nat least not outside of very\nsecured installations anyway.\n\n00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.462\nSo that part,\nI thought was actually kinda neat.\n\n00:31:53.462 --> 00:31:55.600\nIt was something you know,\nsomething you have something you have,\n\n00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.390\nsomething you are,\n\n00:31:56.390 --> 00:32:00.300\nall joined together that they do all three\nfactors to allow this person to get in.\n\n00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.670\nAnd the biometric part, the something\nyou are, was actually kinda cool.\n\n00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:07.190\n>> Yeah and multi factor authentication\nis becoming quite common anymore nowadays\n\n00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.930\nanywhere.\n\n00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.499\nI mean Don does it just to log into\nhis standard laptop [CROSSTALK].\n\n00:32:11.499 --> 00:32:15.232\n>> That's because Don's cool, I wanna\nbe like Don when I grow up he's cool,\n\n00:32:15.232 --> 00:32:17.280\nthat's why he does that.\n\n00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.990\n>> But it's easy to do, it's not as\ndifficult to implement as it once was.\n\n00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.880\nAnd it's become cheaper as well,\nso there's really no reason to not\n\n00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.770\nuse these things when we can and\nprovide that extra level of security that\n\n00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:32.930\nis always nice to have and make sure\nthat you've got things on lockdown.\n\n00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:34.170\n>> Correct, but with one caveat.\n\n00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:37.590\nSo the issue there is not cost,\nas you said, it has come down.\n\n00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:40.310\nIt's not availability,\nthere are many vendors that do this.\n\n00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.940\nThe challenge, the only thing,\nit's nice to have, don't get me wrong.\n\n00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.360\nSo I agree 100% will as Daniel just said.\n\n00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.330\nBut with one caveat, which is\nimplementation is not harder today,\n\n00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:54.600\nit's easier but\nthe one chance we still have not overcome\n\n00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.120\nis the awareness of the users and\nthe ability to train them to understand\n\n00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.212\nthat they can use these systems and\nthat they are gonna be receptive to it.\n\n00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:04.670\nSo, when you say to somebody, hey we're\ngonna shoot a light in your eye and\n\n00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:08.350\nwe're gonna expect you to scan to do that,\nusers still look at you and go,\n\n00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.855\nyou're out of your mind right?\n\n00:33:09.855 --> 00:33:11.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not happening.\n\n00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.240\nNow we know that light going\nyour eye is not gonna harm you,\n\n00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.360\nwe know that's not gonna be an issue.\n\n00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.200\nBut when you tell somebody,\nwe're gonna put a light\n\n00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:23.150\nInto the back of your eye to scan\nthe retina or to scan the iris,\n\n00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.310\nthey're just not really receptive\nto that no matter how cheap it is,\n\n00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:30.300\nno matter how cool it is, no matter how\neasy it is, they just still say no.\n\n00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:34.735\nSo it may still be a problem even\nthough its easy to do, user acceptance,\n\n00:33:34.735 --> 00:33:36.185\nunfortunately, in all reality,\n\n00:33:36.185 --> 00:33:39.235\nis still the hurdle we have to\novercome there, more often than not.\n\n00:33:39.235 --> 00:33:39.795\n>> All right, Adam.\n\n00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:41.915\nWell, we've gone through\na lot of cool stuff today.\n\n00:33:41.915 --> 00:33:44.634\nFinished a look in at\nsoftware verification ,right,\n\n00:33:44.634 --> 00:33:46.735\nmaking sure that they are secure.\n\n00:33:46.735 --> 00:33:47.647\n>> And identity and access management.\n\n00:33:47.647 --> 00:33:49.245\n>> And identity and access management.\n\n00:33:49.245 --> 00:33:50.485\nA lot of cool stuff there.\n\n00:33:50.485 --> 00:33:51.955\nI always enjoy that topic.\n\n00:33:51.955 --> 00:33:53.275\nAdam, thanks so much for dropping by.\n\n00:33:53.275 --> 00:33:55.305\nAnd thanks for\nexplaining these things for us.\n\n00:33:55.305 --> 00:33:56.675\nAnd we thank you guys for watching.\n\n00:33:56.675 --> 00:33:58.340\nBut We are gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.300\nFor IT PRO.TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:01.833\n>> I'm an Irish skin.\n\n00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:04.557\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.090\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing on with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.520\ncertified cloud security\nprofessional series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.530\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us with move along with that\n\n6\n00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.770\nendeavor is our good friend Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.820\nAdam, welcome back to the show and\nhow is it going today?\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.867\n>> Good, good,\nI'm feeling a little risk adverse today.\n\n9\n00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:34.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm not willing to go out on a limb and\n\n10\n00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.450\nworry about the world's risks.\n\n11\n00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.890\nI wanna contain them and\n\n12\n00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.100\nI wanna make sure we understand\nhow to comprehend what they are.\n\n13\n00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.840\nAnd in order to do that we have to in this\nepisode talk a bit about comprehending and\n\n14\n00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.920\nunderstanding the specifics of\nCloud application architecture.\n\n15\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.970\nBut also understanding how\nwe're gonna spool that out and\n\n16\n00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.840\ndeal with that with\nregards to not just risk.\n\n17\n00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.900\nBut all the supporting elements,\nall the technologies,\n\n18\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.690\nall the things we do to mitigate and\n\n19\n00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.430\nessentially manage risk down in the\norganization with regards to application\n\n20\n00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.590\narchitecture and along the way,\ntalk about some of the cool technology.\n\n21\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.840\nThings like web application firewalls\na database activity monitoring and\n\n22\n00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.570\nalso test it.\n\n23\n00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.220\nHow do we go out and test applications and\nunderstand how to deal with them,\n\n24\n00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.360\nto ensure that they're as\nsecure as they can be.\n\n25\n00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.620\nWe've been talking a lot in some\nof the prior episodes in this area\n\n26\n00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.480\nwith regards to working with the\ndevelopment function in the organization.\n\n27\n00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.630\nHelping the Abdev team or the individual\nor whoever, whatever that is\n\n28\n00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.410\nto understand the issues and\nconcerns associated with security right?\n\n29\n00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.120\nAnd when we think about our role as CCSPs,\nand we think about acting with due care,\n\n30\n00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.340\nand exercising due diligence we have to\nthrow our oversight into the mix here.\n\n31\n00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.110\nWe have to offer or add in our\nconcerns with regards to security so\n\n32\n00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.230\nthat as we go through the SDLC And\n\n33\n00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.540\nwe look to tack on that first of\nthe two S's that should be there.\n\n34\n00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.070\nSSDLC, right?\n\n35\n00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.650\nFor secure software system\ndevelopment life cycle.\n\n36\n00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.570\nWe wanna understand that\nour adding of security and\n\n37\n00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.150\nour observations and\nthe thought process around them have to be\n\n38\n00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.710\nbuilt in at every state just we've often\ntalked about of the development cycle.\n\n39\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.790\nIs do the requirements gathering upfront,\nas we go into design,\n\n40\n00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.880\nas we go into development,\nas we go into testing.\n\n41\n00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.900\nAs we ultimately go into operations, and\n\n42\n00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.750\nthen secure disposal throughout the entire\nlife cycle, we wanna understand that\n\n43\n00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.150\nsecurity has a place in every area, at\nevery phase, and should be acknowledged,\n\n44\n00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.470\nshould be recognized, and\nshould be thought about all throughout.\n\n45\n00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.810\nNow, remember, it's our job as CCSPs,\nto figure out how to do that,\n\n46\n00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.970\nto convince the business\nthat there's value in that.\n\n47\n00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.970\nIt's the job of the application\ndeveloper to ignore us.\n\n48\n00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.075\nRight?\nOnly kidding.\n\n49\n00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:41.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's the job of the application\n\n50\n00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.970\ndeveloper to certainly work with us and\n\n51\n00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.300\ntry to figure out jointly how to\nbuild the best possible application.\n\n52\n00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.760\nBut remember, their focus is going\nto be on building the application,\n\n53\n00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.010\nnot on securing the application.\n\n54\n00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.960\nWe have to help them, just like they help\nus, to understand how to do security in\n\n55\n00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.460\na way that doesn't get in the way\nof the functional requirements,\n\n56\n00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.970\nthe must haves as we often talk about.\n\n57\n00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.450\nAnd perhaps also the non functional\nrequirements, the nice to haves,\n\n58\n00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.510\nbecause you know there's a mix typically\nof those in most applications and\n\n59\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.640\nbecause of that we may say to\nthe application developer.\n\n60\n00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.530\nFor instance right?\n\n61\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.190\nYou want to help me out here?\n\n62\n00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.180\nYou want to be an application\ndeveloper for a second?\n\n63\n00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.280\n>> I'll do my best.\n\n64\n00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.440\nI don't have any skinny jeans but\nworth a try.\n\n65\n00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.810\n>> You drink mountain dew though right?\n\n66\n00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.200\n>> Yeah.\n>> You drink mountain dew and\n\n67\n00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.200\nthat is all you need.\n\n68\n00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.540\nSo were going to give you an in\nthe field promotion here.\n\n69\n00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.220\nYou're in real time.\n\n70\n00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.960\nRight?\n\n71\n00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.590\nSo if you are gonna be the app developer\nwere kinda have a conversation\n\n72\n00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.120\nwith regards to security.\n\n73\n00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.060\nYou, it may go something like this.\n\n74\n00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.700\nRight.\n\n75\n00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.215\nSo I made up the CCSP save\nto the app developed.\n\n76\n00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:43.515\nLet's talk about requirements gathering a\nlittle bit in the first phase in the SDLC.\n\n77\n00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.505\nWe're gonna go out.\n\n78\n00:03:44.505 --> 00:03:47.995\nYou guys have already done some\napplication development work for\n\n79\n00:03:47.995 --> 00:03:49.135\nus in the past.\n\n80\n00:03:49.135 --> 00:03:51.745\nWe got a sense of having now\nto build some new features\n\n81\n00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:53.997\non under this application\nwe're going to go out, right.\n\n82\n00:03:53.997 --> 00:03:55.267\nWe're going to interview or\n\n83\n00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:58.967\nwe're going to somehow gather those\nrequirements from our stakeholders.\n\n84\n00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:01.897\nRight, cause this is like version\ntwo of the program, right?\n\n85\n00:04:01.897 --> 00:04:04.007\nSo you guys are already know what's going\non there we've already talked a lot\n\n86\n00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:04.898\nabout security.\n\n87\n00:04:04.898 --> 00:04:08.483\nBut let's go out and let's figure out what\nthe new features, the new functional,\n\n88\n00:04:08.483 --> 00:04:10.208\nnon-functional requirements gonna be.\n\n89\n00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:14.748\nAnd then let's make sure that we agree on\nhow you're gonna implement those things\n\n90\n00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:18.168\nthat we access the security impact\nan the risk assessment of them.\n\n91\n00:04:18.168 --> 00:04:21.698\nSo, what is the security function that it\nsay it's gonna say something like that?\n\n92\n00:04:21.698 --> 00:04:25.590\nWhat is the function say to all that,\nwhat do you need?\n\n93\n00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.470\nWe can build it if you need it.\n\n94\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.030\n>> Okay we can build it if you need it.\n\n95\n00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.290\nOr they may say obviously let's go\ngather the requirements and do all that.\n\n96\n00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.230\nBut you know what we've already done\nbecause this is one of the issues that\n\n97\n00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.120\nconcerns we have.\n\n98\n00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.900\nWe've already done all\nthat stuff last time.\n\n99\n00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.330\nWhy do we have to do it again.\n\n100\n00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.400\nIn other words,\nthe function may say to us, hey, Adam,\n\n101\n00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.410\nyou know, you put us through\nall this stuff last time.\n\n102\n00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.250\nYou made us like just crawl through\nthe mud to figure this stuff out.\n\n103\n00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.850\nYou made our lives miserable.\n\n104\n00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.990\nAnd they will tell you this by the way.\n\n105\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.540\nIt's exactly what they will say, right.\n\n106\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.270\nYou made our lives miserable.\n\n107\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.910\nWhy are you here?\n\n108\n00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.510\nWhy do we have to do this again?\n\n109\n00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.400\nDidn't we do a good job the first time?\n\n110\n00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.490\nAnd if we did,\nwhy are we worrying about this?\n\n111\n00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.400\nBecause sometimes, and again,\nto be fair Not all the time,\n\n112\n00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.380\na lot of application developers get it.\n\n113\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.590\nThey really understand it today, and\nthey understand that security is a full\n\n114\n00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.070\ntime thing that has to\nalways be thought about, and\n\n115\n00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.370\nalways be assessed every time we open up\na system and look at any kind of change.\n\n116\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.240\nAnd a change is defined,\nAs a modification in add or remove.\n\n117\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.160\nMeaning if you're adding functionality,\nif you're modifying the existing flow,\n\n118\n00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.850\nyou have to worry about what\nthe impact of that is, and\n\n119\n00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.640\nyou have to assess that from a risk and\nsecurity perspective.\n\n120\n00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.160\n>> So, anytime you add a new element\nregardless of the scope or whatever.\n\n121\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.300\n>> Add modifier or loop.\n\n122\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.840\n>> Anything, yeah.\n\n123\n00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.370\n>> Change in existing one.\n\n124\n00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.030\nAdd a new one, right.\n\n125\n00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.553\n>> It's now a different\nentity [CROSSTALK] be redone.\n\n126\n00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:43.490\n>> Right,\nit's essentially a brand new thing.\n\n127\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:44.590\nWe're re-compiling.\n\n128\n00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.410\nBecause of that, we gotta then\nessentially re-assess, right?\n\n129\n00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.020\nCuz if you're gonna change the software,\nwe gotta make sure that what you change\n\n130\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.310\nis not in any way gonna impact\nall the good work you've done.\n\n131\n00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.160\nAnd we gotta add on additional controls\nto make sure that what you are adding,\n\n132\n00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.780\nremoving or modifying is gonna be as\nsecure as what was the there before,\n\n133\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.680\nif not more secure.\n\n134\n00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.960\nIn theory, so that conversation may be\na little bit more rich and dynamic,\n\n135\n00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.120\na little bit more colorful,\nsome expletives may wind up in there.\n\n136\n00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.410\nBut ultimately,\nit's going to be a little bit richer and\n\n137\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.320\na little bit more dynamic than just okay,\nyeah we'll build it.\n\n138\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.780\nWell, of course, you're going to build it,\nbut the point is,\n\n139\n00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.130\nfrom a security standpoint,\nI don't want you just to build it.\n\n140\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.630\nI want you to make sure\nyou build it securely.\n\n141\n00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.640\nWe've got to make sure\nwe partner together.\n\n142\n00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.950\nTo ensure that that's gonna happen, so\n\n143\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.740\nit'd be really really important for\nus, right?\n\n144\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.450\nSo what are some of the things\nwe can do as a CCSP,\n\n145\n00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.370\nto help our developer team\nhere figure this out, right?\n\n146\n00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.645\nOur team of one, right?\n\n147\n00:06:32.645 --> 00:06:34.760\n[LAUGH] And\nhow can we not only help them, but\n\n148\n00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.430\nhow can we help ourselves to be more\nrisk aware and ultimately more secure?\n\n149\n00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.602\nWe can use, and I mentioned some of these\ndevices a few minutes ago in the intro.\n\n150\n00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:46.435\nThings like web application firewalls,\nthese are traditionally OSI layer 7 model\n\n151\n00:06:46.435 --> 00:06:49.170\ndevices, or\nlayer 7 in the OSI model devices.\n\n152\n00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.910\nSo the running of the application layer,\nthey're designed specifically\n\n153\n00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.100\nto address certain kinds of\ntraffic based on the application.\n\n154\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.550\nSo we may have a web application firewall\nthat deals with HTTP, and HTTPS traffic.\n\n155\n00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.820\nWe may have one that deals with FTP.\n\n156\n00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.190\nWe may have one that deals with SMTP\ntraffic, whatever the case may be.\n\n157\n00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.060\nSo they're gonna be tailored\nto deal with that traffic,\n\n158\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.340\nand they're gonna be in line.\n\n159\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.880\nThey're gonna be looking at traffic flow\ningressing and egressing, moving in and\n\n160\n00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.040\nout of our systems.\n\n161\n00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.980\nAnd they're gonna address that traffic.\n\n162\n00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.950\nAnd they're gonna filter it.\n\n163\n00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:22.770\nThey're gonna run it through a series\nof rules or series of pattern matching\n\n164\n00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.640\nexercises To figure out ultimately\nwhat that should look like.\n\n165\n00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:29.720\nAnd if we get a match we may then\ndecide to allow the traffic, or\n\n166\n00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.970\nto deny it or red flag it and\nreport it but still allow it.\n\n167\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.610\nThere's all these things we can do.\n\n168\n00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.390\nWe can link this to our DLP technology.\n\n169\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.970\nDLP runs essentially and works essentially\nin the same way, works at layer seven and\n\n170\n00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:44.280\nis going to look at the traffic flow, and\n\n171\n00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.860\nworks across multiple\nlayers of the OSI model.\n\n172\n00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.485\nAnd it's gonna be looking at traffic flow,\nthe actual stream of traffic.\n\n173\n00:07:50.485 --> 00:07:54.769\nPulling the data in the stream as well as\nthe attached data through any attachments\n\n174\n00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:58.076\nthat may go in or out through email and\ngoing to assess all that.\n\n175\n00:07:58.076 --> 00:08:01.909\nLook at all that and then decide what to\ndo with the based on a pattern match.\n\n176\n00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:05.311\nWe found a SSN,\na social security number match, or\n\n177\n00:08:05.311 --> 00:08:10.376\nwe found a electronic patient record\nmatch for this patient coding field for\n\n178\n00:08:10.376 --> 00:08:14.980\nmedical condition X or Y, or\nwe found a bank account routing number.\n\n179\n00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.190\nWhatever it may be.\n\n180\n00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.210\nWe're gonna then pull that data out.\n\n181\n00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:22.120\nSo these devices, supplemental\nsecurity devices are very helpful.\n\n182\n00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.860\nThey're not gonna directly impact\nthe architecture of the application code.\n\n183\n00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.810\nThey're gonna supplement\nit after the fact, and\n\n184\n00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.540\nallow it to be more effective\nbecause we're gonna bolt\n\n185\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.030\non additional security controls that\nare outside the application, but\n\n186\n00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.490\nwork broadly with all applications,\nso they apply to everything we do.\n\n187\n00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.340\nSo it's gonna be another\nlayer in the defense and\n\n188\n00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.149\ndepth architecture that\nwe're gonna be building.\n\n189\n00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.620\nKind of cool, right?\n\n190\n00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.220\nDatabase activity monitoring\nwhat we call DAM.\n\n191\n00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.530\nCan I say that on the air by the way?\n\n192\n00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.550\n>> Yes.\n>> Is that on the FCC list of\n\n193\n00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.545\nnon approved words?\n\n194\n00:08:51.545 --> 00:08:53.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The top ten list of things you're not\n\n195\n00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.240\nsupposed to say on air.\n\n196\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.112\n>> That list is getting\nshorter by the day.\n\n197\n00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:56.793\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think yeah it is yeah it's\n\n198\n00:08:56.793 --> 00:08:57.385\nlike a top one now or something, right?\n\n199\n00:08:57.385 --> 00:09:02.078\nSo we now have database\nactivity monitoring.\n\n200\n00:09:02.078 --> 00:09:05.570\nThis is, if you think about the logic on\nit, and think about what the name implies,\n\n201\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.360\nessentially just the concept that\nfocus is on the database activity,\n\n202\n00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.640\nallows us to monitor the transitional\nflow of data within the database,\n\n203\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.794\namong the various components within the\nendpoint application accessing the data.\n\n204\n00:09:17.794 --> 00:09:22.130\nLooking at it from a continuous monitoring\nperspective, what is going on, how data is\n\n205\n00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.500\nbeing used, how it's being accessed, we're\nmaking sure we're applying the ACID Model\n\n206\n00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.830\nso that all the transactions are not\nonly going to be complete and\n\n207\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.820\nare gonna be authorized, but are going\nto only show up in the database and\n\n208\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.630\nultimately in the data stream\n>> when they have been\n\n209\n00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.690\ntransacted properly.\n\n210\n00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.820\nSo no incomplete transactions,\nno transactions we don't understand,\n\n211\n00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.290\nno transactions that are outside\nthe operational boundaries of the system\n\n212\n00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:47.145\nwill be allowed.\n\n213\n00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:48.875\nWe'll prevent corruption this way and\n\n214\n00:09:48.875 --> 00:09:52.910\nwe'll obviously then be able to understand\nhow the data is being consumed.\n\n215\n00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.970\nWe may use languages that help us to\ndescribe and understand what's going on.\n\n216\n00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.770\nWe've talked in prior episodes\nabout XACML and XAML.\n\n217\n00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.455\nAnd we've talked about OAuth.\n\n218\n00:10:02.455 --> 00:10:03.080\n>> OAuth 2.\n\n219\n00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.055\nTalked about a lot of these\ndifferent standards and\n\n220\n00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:07.405\nlanguages that are out there.\n\n221\n00:10:07.405 --> 00:10:10.085\nWS Federation is another one that came up.\n\n222\n00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.695\nSo a lot of these are derived from and\n\n223\n00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:16.592\nbuilt on XML, the extensible markup\nlanguage and the the use of XML more and\n\n224\n00:10:16.592 --> 00:10:21.452\nmore today in the web services,\nin the Cloud to understand, to clarify, to\n\n225\n00:10:21.452 --> 00:10:26.347\nstipulate claims and attributes, to make\nclear what we're doing in a way that makes\n\n226\n00:10:26.347 --> 00:10:31.022\nsense to us that's more English-like,\nmore natural from a language perspective.\n\n227\n00:10:31.022 --> 00:10:35.270\nIt's going to help not just the security\nthought processes and risk management, but\n\n228\n00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.880\nhelps our development team to do better\ncoding, because they're using languages\n\n229\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.430\nthat are more transparent, and\ntherefore create more functionality\n\n230\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.790\nthat we can directly understand and\nrelate to as we examine the code.\n\n231\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.440\nSo, all of this is good, right?\n\n232\n00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.360\nAre we gonna use firewalls?\n\n233\n00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.970\nWe're pretty confident, hopefully,\n\n234\n00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.000\nat this point in our conversations,\nat this point in your\n\n235\n00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.434\nprofessional careers that you understand\nthe general concept of firewall.\n\n236\n00:10:56.434 --> 00:10:57.715\n>> Firewall's a firewall.\n\n237\n00:10:57.715 --> 00:11:00.620\nWe apply the word Cloud in front of it,\nit doesn't change,\n\n238\n00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.820\nit's still the border gateway device\nthat accesses the traffic flow and\n\n239\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.094\ndoes some sort of pattern matching\nbased on a set of rules and then as\n\n240\n00:11:09.094 --> 00:11:11.110\n>> a result of that, if we match,\n\n241\n00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.710\nwe allow or don't allow,\nit depends on how we set up the rule set.\n\n242\n00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.470\nBut we have a set of rules you go through.\n\n243\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.160\nIf there is no match at all,\n\n244\n00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.950\nwe always have a default rule at\nthe bottom that says drop all traffic.\n\n245\n00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.310\nSo if you don't match anything,\nwe will essentially not allow you through,\n\n246\n00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.790\nat least in most firewalls\nthat's how we set them up.\n\n247\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.400\nUnless you go in and modify that behavior.\n\n248\n00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.600\n>> And so as a result, we're really just\ntalking about generically border gateway\n\n249\n00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:39.130\nmanagement using a firewall device that\nallows us to look at traffic flows,\n\n250\n00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.090\nto do introspection of traffic.\n\n251\n00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:44.270\nAnd manage based on where you're\ncoming from and where you're going to,\n\n252\n00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:48.120\nso IP origination or destination,\nMAC address origination or\n\n253\n00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.640\ndestination, protocol usage.\n\n254\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:54.130\nThere's all sorts of things we look at in\nfirewalls, and depending on the nature of\n\n255\n00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.410\nthe firewall, depending on the layer of\nthe OSI model the firewall is designed\n\n256\n00:11:57.410 --> 00:12:00.590\nto operate at, we have additional\nfunctionality we can bring to bear.\n\n257\n00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:03.990\n>> Any or all of these can be considered\nto be supplemental security devices.\n\n258\n00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.620\nSo we want to be thinking about how these\nthings work, thinking about the value\n\n259\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.320\nthey provide, thinking about how to link\nthem to our system development life cycle,\n\n260\n00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.965\nor our software development life cycle,\nand how we can build security in by giving\n\n261\n00:12:15.965 --> 00:12:20.430\nthis particular technology, or these\ntechnologies to the development team and\n\n262\n00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.065\nsaying, hey,\nwe're gonna deploy this technology.\n\n263\n00:12:23.065 --> 00:12:24.825\nMake sure your software\nis inline with this.\n\n264\n00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:26.540\nMake sure you support encryption.\n\n265\n00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.100\nRight?\nAnd\n\n266\n00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.620\nthat therefore we can use a web\napplication firewall, to encrypt and\n\n267\n00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.400\ndecrypt traffic flows, and\nwe can use DLP to do that.\n\n268\n00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.930\nSo make sure the application is\ngoing to be encryption aware.\n\n269\n00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.170\nAnd by the way, we're using these\nkinds of encryption algorithms.\n\n270\n00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:41.280\nWe're going to be using AES.\n\n271\n00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.790\nWe're gonna be using the RSA algorithm,\nwe're gonna be using hashing,\n\n272\n00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.710\nand we're gonna use write\nthem D160 in Shy1 and MD5.\n\n273\n00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.790\nSo make sure you build in integrity and\n\n274\n00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.420\nconfidentiality controls into that\napplication, Mr. and Mrs. Developer.\n\n275\n00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.800\nMake sure our application is\nconfidentiality aware, so\n\n276\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.780\nit's encryption aware, so\nthat way when we go to apply encryption,\n\n277\n00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.350\nit actually works, and when we go to\ndecrypt, it actually works, right?\n\n278\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:08.330\nSo that's gonna be important.\n\n279\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:12.800\nSo the use of cryptography, the use of\nencryption specifically to protect data\n\n280\n00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.660\nin transit, to protect data, as we know,\nin storage, at rest, to protect it in use.\n\n281\n00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.170\nAll three of these are very important,\nbut especially when we're thinking about\n\n282\n00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.220\nworking with the application\ndevelopment team.\n\n283\n00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:27.410\nWe gotta make sure they understand that\napplications must be encryption aware and\n\n284\n00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.580\nmust be able to support encryption across\nthe entire spectrum of connectivity.\n\n285\n00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.380\nSo while we're using it on the desktop\nin use, while we're sending the data on\n\n286\n00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.510\nthe wire in transit, while we're\nstoring data on the backend at rest.\n\n287\n00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.300\nThe application developer has to\nunderstand that we're gonna apply\n\n288\n00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:45.190\nencryption across the entire\ndata life cycle, or\n\n289\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:49.360\nthey may not write the application\nin a way that will support that.\n\n290\n00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.250\nOr they may, but they may not do it\nin such a way that's it's gonna work\n\n291\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.510\nwith the encryption standards\nthat we're applying.\n\n292\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.090\nRight?\n\n293\n00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:57.230\nSo PKCS awareness, right?\n\n294\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.720\nSo understanding the messaging,\nthe message transfer formats that we use.\n\n295\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.570\nPKCS number 7 and number 10\n>> for certificates and\n\n296\n00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.380\nthe use of those in the data stream.\n\n297\n00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.800\nThese kind of things, the use of and\nthe support of digital certificates under\n\n298\n00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:15.050\nthe x.509 version 3 standard as opposed\nto earlier standards or a later standard.\n\n299\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:16.310\nWe gotta build all that in and\n\n300\n00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.140\ntell our developers these\nare the roads we're going down.\n\n301\n00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.080\nThese are the security concerns we have,\nand these are the control mechanisms we're\n\n302\n00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:27.530\ngonna put in place or wanna support in\norder to define how to manage those risks.\n\n303\n00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.470\nAll that knowledge becomes very important,\nright?\n\n304\n00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.240\n>> So basically, we're telling them we're\nbuilding a secure environment, and if\n\n305\n00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.040\nyou're developing an app, it needs to be\nable to work inside of that environment.\n\n306\n00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:36.830\n>> Do it my way or else.\n\n307\n00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:37.590\n>> Yeah, that's exactly right.\n\n308\n00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.930\nI like the way you think.\n\n309\n00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.140\n>> I'm a benevolent\ndictator as I often say.\n\n310\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.120\nAs long as you go my way, we're fine.\n\n311\n00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.869\nYou have democracy as\nlong as you vote my way.\n\n312\n00:14:44.869 --> 00:14:46.400\nThat's how it works.\n\n313\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.070\nIf not, then woe to you who\ndoesn't vote the right way, right?\n\n314\n00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.620\nBut as a CCSP, we have to think\nabout the fact that, ultimately,\n\n315\n00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:59.660\nthat we, as the security voice of\nthe organization, don't get the final say,\n\n316\n00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.500\nbut we have to have a seat at the table\nand we've got to voice the concerns,\n\n317\n00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.670\nthe business requirements and the needs of\nthe business from a security standpoint,\n\n318\n00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.700\nfrom a risk awareness standpoint, so\n\n319\n00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.150\nthat every other member of that\norganizational team understands why\n\n320\n00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.760\nwe need to do things the way we\ndo them and is aligned with that.\n\n321\n00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.740\nAlignment is really fundamentally\nimportant here because,\n\n322\n00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.180\nif the CCSP can drive through\nthe conversation and create awareness and\n\n323\n00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:28.731\nultimately alignment in the team with\nregard to how to manage risk, wow,\n\n324\n00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:31.880\nwhat a different world we're gonna\nlive in as we go through that,\n\n325\n00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.730\nif you think about that,\nvery, very important.\n\n326\n00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:39.180\nData in transit encryption is gonna be\nincredibly important as we talked about.\n\n327\n00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.860\nAlso data at rest, as I spoke about.\n\n328\n00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.300\nSo what are some options for\ndata in transit encryption?\n\n329\n00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.645\nWe talked about these before, but using\nSSL or TSL for instance will be options\n\n330\n00:15:47.645 --> 00:15:50.680\nthat most people have in their\nmind as we talk about this stuff.\n\n331\n00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.210\nWhat about using VPN gateways?\n\n332\n00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:57.050\nWould VPNs like IPsec, LTTP with IPsec,\nso tunneling protocol with encryption?\n\n333\n00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.455\nThese would be good examples of\nhow we encrypt data on the wire.\n\n334\n00:15:59.455 --> 00:16:01.255\nWhat about data at rest?\n\n335\n00:16:01.255 --> 00:16:04.093\nWe could do whole instance encryption,\nwe've talked about that,\n\n336\n00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:05.750\nencrypt the entire storage instance.\n\n337\n00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.673\nWe do volume encryption,\nencrypt one volume, right, but\n\n338\n00:16:08.673 --> 00:16:09.964\nnot the entire instance.\n\n339\n00:16:09.964 --> 00:16:12.610\nOr file level indoor directory encryption.\n\n340\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.670\nIn other words, we can start with\nthe whole disk, a portion of the disk\n\n341\n00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:20.470\ncarved out on a LAN or a volume, or just\nfiles and data within that specific space.\n\n342\n00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:21.920\nWe've got three different areas and\n\n343\n00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.210\nthree different ways we can apply\nencryption when data's at rest.\n\n344\n00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.771\nAnd we have to think about what the best\nproposition will be for usage, for\n\n345\n00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:31.890\nperformance optimization, but\nalso for risk management.\n\n346\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.720\nBecause if all we do is file\nindoor databased encryption,\n\n347\n00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:39.314\nwhen I say databased,\nI mean data as opposed to database, right?\n\n348\n00:16:39.314 --> 00:16:39.973\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just to be clear, right?\n\n349\n00:16:39.973 --> 00:16:42.160\n[LAUGH] Different totally,\ndifferent approach.\n\n350\n00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.030\nSo when we do file and or\ndata encryption on the system itself,\n\n351\n00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.930\nwe're dealing with just individual\nbits within a much larger container.\n\n352\n00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.410\nAnd the bits surrounding\nit may not be encrypted,\n\n353\n00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.232\ndepending on the files we choose, right?\n\n354\n00:16:55.232 --> 00:16:57.500\nSo wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n355\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:02.140\nWithin that idea, if we broaden that,\nand start creating concentric circles,\n\n356\n00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:06.285\nthat go wider and wider, to ultimately\nencompass the entire hard drive or\n\n357\n00:17:06.285 --> 00:17:10.120\nentire storage mechanism,\nwe've protected all the data.\n\n358\n00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.410\nBut in the lowest common denominator\nexample, just file based encryption,\n\n359\n00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.730\nwe're protecting a very\nsmall subset of that data.\n\n360\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.900\nSo we have to understand where to apply\nthe protection and how broad ranging we\n\n361\n00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.330\nwant it to be, that's also gonna be\nvery important for us to consider.\n\n362\n00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.667\nWhen we think about access control\nmechanisms, and identity and\n\n363\n00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:27.759\naccess management,\n\n364\n00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:31.841\nwe've talked about ways we can protect\ndata but also ensure confidentiality.\n\n365\n00:17:31.841 --> 00:17:35.423\nWe talked about obfuscation and\nautomization, masking.\n\n366\n00:17:35.423 --> 00:17:39.052\nWent through had a really nice\nconversation about tokenization in a prior\n\n367\n00:17:39.052 --> 00:17:39.587\nepisode.\n\n368\n00:17:39.587 --> 00:17:41.165\nYou put together that whole graphic,\nright.\n\n369\n00:17:41.165 --> 00:17:42.940\nYou know one that we haven't\ndone with those things?\n\n370\n00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.276\nYou haven't Flash animated them?\n\n371\n00:17:44.276 --> 00:17:45.563\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Remember that nifty little graphic\n\n372\n00:17:45.563 --> 00:17:46.103\ntool of yours.\n\n373\n00:17:46.103 --> 00:17:50.305\nSo like we can hit the button and the data\nactually flows and that's like part two.\n\n374\n00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:51.618\n>> We gotta throw that out\nto the software developers.\n\n375\n00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:52.163\n>> Right?\n\n376\n00:17:52.163 --> 00:17:53.743\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> See if we can figure that out.\n\n377\n00:17:53.743 --> 00:17:56.015\nGet the software developers to\ndeal with that issue, right.\n\n378\n00:17:56.015 --> 00:17:59.500\nSo we talked about tokenization,\nwent through the process.\n\n379\n00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.200\nI explained to you how\ntokenization happens.\n\n380\n00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.200\nRemember we're gonna take take\nthe authorized application,\n\n381\n00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.860\nwe're gonna create data.\n\n382\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.970\nWe're not gonna store that data\nthere unencrypted, unmanaged.\n\n383\n00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.830\nWe're gonna move it off the application\nserver up to the tokenization server and\n\n384\n00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.980\nthe token database.\n\n385\n00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.265\nWe're gonna generate a token that\nessentially represents the data but\n\n386\n00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:21.195\nis not meaningful outside of\nthe system in and of itself.\n\n387\n00:18:21.195 --> 00:18:23.725\nIt's gonna represent the data\nwithout exposing it.\n\n388\n00:18:23.725 --> 00:18:27.055\nWe're then gonna generate that token,\nbring that token back down,\n\n389\n00:18:27.055 --> 00:18:29.502\nstore that token on\nthe application server.\n\n390\n00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:32.350\nA proxying essentially and\nredirecting to represent the data but\n\n391\n00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.762\nwithout exposing it.\n\n392\n00:18:33.762 --> 00:18:37.842\nAnd then we're gonna allow an authorized\napplication to come in, claim that token,\n\n393\n00:18:37.842 --> 00:18:40.882\nuse it to validate that they\nhave the right to see the data.\n\n394\n00:18:40.882 --> 00:18:44.882\nAnd exchange the token for the data\nthrough a secured transmission process and\n\n395\n00:18:44.882 --> 00:18:46.572\na lookup at the token database.\n\n396\n00:18:46.572 --> 00:18:48.652\nThat's essentially what happens, right?\n\n397\n00:18:48.652 --> 00:18:52.950\nAnd so tokenization will generate\nthese tokens and allow us to use them.\n\n398\n00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.630\nThis is yet\nanother supplemental security solution.\n\n399\n00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.410\nData masking as I mentioned,\nwill be another way to do this.\n\n400\n00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.860\nWe actually keep the data string and\nthe format, but\n\n401\n00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.600\nwe actually change the way we actually\nwill represent the data, right?\n\n402\n00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.510\nSo the data itself, the integrity,\nthe structure of the data is the same.\n\n403\n00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.220\nBut we hide the data right, so\nwe're not gonna show it to you that way\n\n404\n00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.560\nin the formal way that it normally shows\nup in the app until you're authorized.\n\n405\n00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.645\nSo these are all different approaches.\n\n406\n00:19:17.645 --> 00:19:19.270\nSandboxing, another one that we can do.\n\n407\n00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.380\nThis is sometimes called memory isolation.\n\n408\n00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.300\nWe're going to run\nthe system in such a way\n\n409\n00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.090\nthat it's not gonna interact\nwith other systems.\n\n410\n00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.170\nSo this is really kind of the heart and\nsoul of virtualization, right?\n\n411\n00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.400\nWe can isolate with the hypervisor and\nextract resources.\n\n412\n00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.940\nAnd we can put a virtual machine or\nmultiple VMs into a sandbox and run them\n\n413\n00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:42.820\nwith isolation from the underlying host,\nbut also isolation from other VMs and\n\n414\n00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:46.420\nother resources in that network,\nvirtual and/or physical.\n\n415\n00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.020\nBecause we can give them they're own\nspace and their own resources to run.\n\n416\n00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.010\nSo wanna think about this,\nwe only use the intended components,\n\n417\n00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.280\nwe only use the resources\noffered to us with sandboxing.\n\n418\n00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.600\nSandboxing is used a lot,\nnot just in virtualization overall.\n\n419\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.610\nBut it's used, for instance,\n\n420\n00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:04.660\nthe Java security model uses the concept\nof sandboxing and memory isolation.\n\n421\n00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.851\nAlthough it doesn't always\nimplement it correctly,\n\n422\n00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:09.434\n[LAUGH] as we know cuz there are a lot\nof security issues with Java.\n\n423\n00:20:09.434 --> 00:20:11.316\nBut the idea behind is still sound, and\n\n424\n00:20:11.316 --> 00:20:15.010\nthis is kinda what sits at the heart\nof that, and has for many years.\n\n425\n00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.900\nWe also think about this with\napplication virtualization.\n\n426\n00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.660\nA form of sand boxing, but\nspecific to the implementation of one or\n\n427\n00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.210\nmore applications in the system where we\ninstall them into memory, zero footprint,\n\n428\n00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.930\nzero touch on the desktop, and\nwe remove them from the running memory of\n\n429\n00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.650\nthe system dynamically, so they never\nactually reside in the hard drive.\n\n430\n00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.360\nThey simply are there running in a dynamic\nway until we're done using them.\n\n431\n00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.120\nSo another example potentially\nof a sandboxing event.\n\n432\n00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.100\nWe also use this in malware detection.\n\n433\n00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.570\nWe use it not only in a response\nmechanism but also for malware research.\n\n434\n00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:52.355\nIf we find evidence of some sort of\ninfection we can sandbox off the system.\n\n435\n00:20:52.355 --> 00:20:56.780\nAnd we then can go ahead and\nuse that sand boxing, that isolation,\n\n436\n00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.680\nto be able to analyze the malware,\nor whatever's infected the system,\n\n437\n00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.550\nwhat we think is malware,\nmay or may not know what it is.\n\n438\n00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.170\nBut we can isolate it, we can then\nessentially research it, without worrying\n\n439\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.760\nabout infecting, if we do it the right\nway, all the other systems around us.\n\n440\n00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.210\nSo sandboxing is a very valuable tool,\n\n441\n00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.930\nas is application virtualization, as we\ntalked about, running that app in memory.\n\n442\n00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:21.535\nI don't know if you remember, Microsoft,\nyears ago before they developed their own\n\n443\n00:21:21.535 --> 00:21:25.050\nApp-V technology, cuz they kind of,\nas many companies do, they go out and\n\n444\n00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:29.240\nthey acquire, right, systems and\ntechnology and then they build on it.\n\n445\n00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.040\nAnd so they actually went out and\nbought a company called ExaGrid.\n\n446\n00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.260\nI don't know if you remember ExaGrid?\n\n447\n00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:33.781\n>> I can't say I do.\n\n448\n00:21:33.781 --> 00:21:37.900\n>> ExaGrid was kinda the leader in\nthe App-V space many, many years ago.\n\n449\n00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:41.032\nAnd Microsoft acquired them and\nultimately then got the technology and\n\n450\n00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:44.212\nthe rights to be able to build out what\nthey now use under the name App-V in\n\n451\n00:21:44.212 --> 00:21:46.730\ntheir application virtualization engine.\n\n452\n00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.990\nCitrix is obviously you know for many\nyears been one of the acknowledged leaders\n\n453\n00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.850\nin the app space and\nthe desktop management space.\n\n454\n00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:58.060\nIn these areas there's XenApp,\nXenDesktop solution going back many,\n\n455\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.980\nmany years under different names, but\n\n456\n00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.920\nultimately that whole thought process\nwas really pioneered by them.\n\n457\n00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.590\nAnd so these kinds of technologies\nhave existed for some time,\n\n458\n00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:08.250\nand they're very valuable.\n\n459\n00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.669\nAs we think through not\njust the technologies, but\n\n460\n00:22:10.669 --> 00:22:14.160\nultimately really turning our attention\nto understanding assurance and\n\n461\n00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.982\nvalidation in the Cloud, we also have to\nthink about the ways in which we are going\n\n462\n00:22:17.982 --> 00:22:21.607\nto look at the application and try to\nfigure out whether it is valid, right?\n\n463\n00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:23.200\nAnd this is also important.\n\n464\n00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.956\nWe have all these supporting elements and\ncast of characters to actually help us\n\n465\n00:22:26.956 --> 00:22:30.767\naugment security but we gotta make sure,\nas we said, we focus on the application\n\n466\n00:22:30.767 --> 00:22:34.150\nitself, work with the developers,\nget them to think about security.\n\n467\n00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.640\nAnd we have think about software\nassurance, and verification and\n\n468\n00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.815\nvalidation activities to ensure that\nthrough different kinds of testing, and\n\n469\n00:22:41.815 --> 00:22:45.802\ncode review, and vetting of\nthe application, and interoperability, and\n\n470\n00:22:45.802 --> 00:22:48.855\nmaking sure that the system\nworks with other systems, and\n\n471\n00:22:48.855 --> 00:22:53.592\nit doesn't break everything that's already\nthere, and through constant monitoring,\n\n472\n00:22:53.592 --> 00:22:57.582\nthat we're actually creating software\nthat will ultimately contribute,\n\n473\n00:22:57.582 --> 00:23:01.720\nright, to the security of the system and\nnot detract from it in any way.\n\n474\n00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.600\nSo we have to think about how we do this,\nit's very, very important.\n\n475\n00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.720\nWe can't just put a piece of code out\nthere, digitally sign it, and say yeah,\n\n476\n00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.370\nit's good, it's valid,\njust go ahead and use it.\n\n477\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:10.470\nI mean, we could, but\n\n478\n00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:14.290\nall that does is represent the fact that\nthe vendor said yeah, this is our code.\n\n479\n00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.910\nIt doesn't tell you it's secure.\n\n480\n00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.680\nIt simply tells you where it came from.\n\n481\n00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.910\nYou have verification and validation,\n\n482\n00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:21.655\nit's a little bit more than\njust saying I know the source.\n\n483\n00:23:21.655 --> 00:23:23.595\nIt's about understanding\nthe functionality, and\n\n484\n00:23:23.595 --> 00:23:26.635\nthe impact and implication of\nmaking the choice to actually\n\n485\n00:23:26.635 --> 00:23:28.775\nown the risk of using that software.\n\n486\n00:23:28.775 --> 00:23:31.115\nThat's really, more so,\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n487\n00:23:31.115 --> 00:23:31.775\nAnd the government and\n\n488\n00:23:31.775 --> 00:23:36.125\nmilitary spaces is often referred to as\nC&A, Certification and Accreditation.\n\n489\n00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:39.565\nWe don't really see those terms outside\nof the private sector very much.\n\n490\n00:23:39.565 --> 00:23:42.135\nAnd we're morphing more and\nmore, toward verification and\n\n491\n00:23:42.135 --> 00:23:46.240\nvalidation in general, because of the use\nof the risk management framework today and\n\n492\n00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.680\nthe use of secure system\nengineering processes.\n\n493\n00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.820\nSo you may not really see\nthis as CnA much anymore.\n\n494\n00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.421\nYou really see it as at V&V, as V&V,\nas opposed to B&B and or B2B.\n\n495\n00:23:56.421 --> 00:23:58.465\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH] But verification and\n\n496\n00:23:58.465 --> 00:23:59.730\nvalidation.\n\n497\n00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.809\nIt's silly Thursday here at ITProTV,\n\n498\n00:24:01.809 --> 00:24:04.338\nas opposed to freaky\nFriday which is tomorrow.\n\n499\n00:24:04.338 --> 00:24:07.306\n[LAUGH]\n>> Cloud-based verification and\n\n500\n00:24:07.306 --> 00:24:11.826\nvalidation is always important, and we\nhave to as CCSPs Think about the fact that\n\n501\n00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:15.149\nagain we may not be on the leading\nedge of this activities but\n\n502\n00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:18.074\nwe do need to understand that\nwe have to play a part and\n\n503\n00:24:18.074 --> 00:24:21.160\nhave a voice in making sure\nthat they are present.\n\n504\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.060\nThe lead on this kind of\ntechnologies regards to testing\n\n505\n00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.000\nis really gonna be app dev function.\n\n506\n00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.650\nThe validation and verification solution.\n\n507\n00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:31.700\nThe testing capabilities that are brought\nto bear is going to be part of\n\n508\n00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.070\nthe application development cycle.\n\n509\n00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.940\nPart of the SDLC.\n\n510\n00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.300\nAnd we have to make sure it happens there.\n\n511\n00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.470\nAnd we then have to pay attention\nto the results and make.\n\n512\n00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:40.800\nMake sure we have a dialogue\nabout what they mean and\n\n513\n00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.440\nhow they're gonna help us to manage\nrisk down in the organization.\n\n514\n00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.920\nWe also have to think about\ncloud based functional data.\n\n515\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.590\nThe idea that a lot of the functional\ndata or the definition that we go to.\n\n516\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.280\nWhat the ideal functional\ndata should say refers\n\n517\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.980\nto specific services that we\nas the cloud provider and or\n\n518\n00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.970\nas the internal private IT cloud\nprovider meaning essentially\n\n519\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.730\nthe business that's in the business of\nproviding cloud to the business, right?\n\n520\n00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.400\nWhatever that is, but the functional\ndata refers to specific services that\n\n521\n00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.345\nwe're gonna offer wherever they come from\nthat have some form of legal implication.\n\n522\n00:25:13.345 --> 00:25:17.655\nSo we have to understand, that, from\na compliance and governance perspective.\n\n523\n00:25:17.655 --> 00:25:22.025\nIf a service that we offer has some\nsort of regulatory or legal or\n\n524\n00:25:22.025 --> 00:25:24.225\nstatutory compliance associated with it,\n\n525\n00:25:24.225 --> 00:25:26.272\nwe have to identify that as\nthe cloud service provider.\n\n526\n00:25:26.272 --> 00:25:30.072\nAnd we have to make sure as we've talked\nabout that we're risk aligned there and\n\n527\n00:25:30.072 --> 00:25:33.622\nthat we're managing compliance and\nengaging in activities that allow us to\n\n528\n00:25:33.622 --> 00:25:39.262\nshow through auditability, trace ability,\nvisibility et cetera all the ities, right?\n\n529\n00:25:39.262 --> 00:25:41.552\nVisibility, traceability, auditability,\n\n530\n00:25:41.552 --> 00:25:45.002\nwe have to show that we are acting in\nthe proper way to prove compliance.\n\n531\n00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:49.106\nIt's very important so with regards to\napplication development we have to think\n\n532\n00:25:49.106 --> 00:25:53.269\nabout the fact that in a SaaS model, when\nthe cloud provider's developing the app\n\n533\n00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:57.370\nand they're essentially giving us the\nright to rent that software, they have to\n\n534\n00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:01.760\ntake into account functional data concerns\nwith regards to regulatory compliance.\n\n535\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.621\nAnd they have to ensure that the\ndevelopment cycle of the app is gonna be\n\n536\n00:26:05.621 --> 00:26:06.585\ncompliant.\n\n537\n00:26:06.585 --> 00:26:09.765\nSo that way when it's used by the customer\nthere's no question about whether or\n\n538\n00:26:09.765 --> 00:26:13.765\nnot they're following the letter as well\nthe spirit and intent of the regulation.\n\n539\n00:26:13.765 --> 00:26:16.825\nIf the cloud provider,\nif the SaaS provider doesn't do that then\n\n540\n00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:21.105\nthe customer's consuming a service and\nmay very well not be within compliance.\n\n541\n00:26:21.105 --> 00:26:22.970\nThey may very well be breaking the law.\n\n542\n00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.650\nAnd we may not know that as the customer,\nbecause we're assuming,\n\n543\n00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.840\nagain we're relying on because\nof the transference of risk and\n\n544\n00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:32.840\nthe nature of the trust relationship\nthat we build in the SaaS model.\n\n545\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.250\nOr at least we assume is there, anyway,\n\n546\n00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.060\nin the SaaS model, that the vendor\nhas taken care of those concerns.\n\n547\n00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.110\nWe assume in other words that\nSalesforce or who ever the vendor is\n\n548\n00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:45.110\nhas figured it out what all the regulatory\nconcerns are or a functional data and\n\n549\n00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.660\nthat they've even addressed those in\nthe platform and that their controls and\n\n550\n00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.260\ntheir reporting and their risk management\nmakes us compliant by using that.\n\n551\n00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.900\nAnd remember the cloud vendor is gonna\ngive us that attestation, right?\n\n552\n00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.440\nThey're gonna go through get it on it\ndone at least hopefully they do and\n\n553\n00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.270\nthey should and\nas a result of having that audit done,\n\n554\n00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.250\ncuz remember we may not be able to drive\nthe audit ourselves as the customer.\n\n555\n00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.030\nThey're not gonna probably give us access.\n\n556\n00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:10.290\nSo, we have to work with them in order\nto make sure that audit gets done.\n\n557\n00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.890\nThey have to show us\nthe results of that audit.\n\n558\n00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.900\nAnd then through an attestation\nform of some kind,\n\n559\n00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.280\nthey're gonna give us the ability\nas a customer to validate\n\n560\n00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.280\nthat through their efforts that\nwe are essentially compliant.\n\n561\n00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:26.390\nAnd we'll provide that attestation\nletter or form or whatever it may be,\n\n562\n00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.800\nit may be a report of some kind,\nwhatever it is.\n\n563\n00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.670\nWe'll give that to our auditors,\nand our auditors will then\n\n564\n00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.040\nuse that to validate that we\nare compliant as a result of that, right?\n\n565\n00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.360\nSo, we're kind of propagating\ntheir compliance and\n\n566\n00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.110\nthat risk management down the chain.\n\n567\n00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.100\nBut it starts with the vendor,\nin this case the SaaS vendor.\n\n568\n00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.170\nBecause remember, right?\n\n569\n00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.940\nWe don't have the ability to be able\nto manage that level of risk and\n\n570\n00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.050\nsee that level of oversight in\nthe system in a SaaS model.\n\n571\n00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.770\nIt's not exposed to us as customers, and\ndepending on the service model, we may or\n\n572\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.320\nmay not have that capability.\n\n573\n00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.440\n>> Are there any instances specifically\nyou can thin on top of your head\n\n574\n00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.660\nthat would be, well,\nwe'd like to use that SaaS model but\n\n575\n00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.530\neven though the vendors do a really good\njob and they try to give you auditing and\n\n576\n00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.960\nall of the things that you would need\nrequire to be able to use that SaaS.\n\n577\n00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.560\nWe're just, cuz it's just going to\nbe a no go, because of x factor.\n\n578\n00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.030\n>> So sure, so, for instance.\n\n579\n00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.590\nGreat question,\n\n580\n00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:22.810\nso, if we think about HIPAA high tech,\nin the United States, right?\n\n581\n00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.000\nSo, the set of legislative and\nlegal requirements around\n\n582\n00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.160\nmanagement of electronic patient records,\nhealth records,\n\n583\n00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.560\ndata related to any of the medical\nconcerns you may have as an individual.\n\n584\n00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.740\nAnd how not just cloud providers but any\nmedical provider that touches that date\n\n585\n00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:44.800\nhas to be compliant with a 500 page set\nof rules and legislative requirements.\n\n586\n00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.170\nThat are very complex and very, very\ndifficult to ultimately navigate through.\n\n587\n00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:53.450\nSo, we think about that, the SaaS\nproviders and the medical space that\n\n588\n00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.970\nare doing this kind of work, that provide\ncloud base electronic records management\n\n589\n00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:02.340\nand insurance companies who provide\nbilling systems that are cloud based, and\n\n590\n00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:05.920\nall this kind of stuff and\nall the lateral support elements, right?\n\n591\n00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.770\nThe laboratories that do the blood\ntesting that have to touch this stuff and\n\n592\n00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.010\nultimately report results.\n\n593\n00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:13.950\nWhat is it, Quest Diagnostics,\none of the big labs, right?\n\n594\n00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:17.410\nSo Quest, or whoever it may be, you think\nabout all the supporting elements in this\n\n595\n00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:20.000\nkind of a silo, right,\nin this particular area.\n\n596\n00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.570\nLots and lots and\n\n597\n00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.220\nlots of different vendors are providing\nvery specific kinds of software.\n\n598\n00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.520\nSome cloud enabled, some not,\n\n599\n00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:33.050\nthat are going to serve elements of these\nparticular supporting technology solutions\n\n600\n00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:38.085\nto provide cloud based access to elements\nof the data stream, right around\n\n601\n00:29:38.085 --> 00:29:41.245\nthese patient records that are essentially\ngonna be regulated under HIPAA.\n\n602\n00:29:41.245 --> 00:29:43.255\nSo some of these may be compliant.\n\n603\n00:29:43.255 --> 00:29:46.075\nIndeed they cannot\noperate unless they are,\n\n604\n00:29:46.075 --> 00:29:49.467\nthey can't claim right to management\nthis information that they are.\n\n605\n00:29:49.467 --> 00:29:53.097\nSo as a vendor in this area,\nwe have to certify that we are and\n\n606\n00:29:53.097 --> 00:29:55.107\na customer, a hospital,\n\n607\n00:29:55.107 --> 00:30:00.017\na clinic, a laboratory, whoever it may be,\na doctor's office, whatever it is.\n\n608\n00:30:00.017 --> 00:30:03.937\nAny one of us has to know and\ndo our due diligence and\n\n609\n00:30:03.937 --> 00:30:08.117\nuse vendors that are going to be able to\nclaim compliancy and as a result of that,\n\n610\n00:30:08.117 --> 00:30:13.190\na regulatory are gonna be managed in\na regulatory sound way that can show,\n\n611\n00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:16.830\nultimately, if we were ever audited, or\nthere's a question of whether we handled\n\n612\n00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:20.390\nthis data correctly, that we have\nthe proof to say, no, absolutely.\n\n613\n00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:21.960\nWe're using a vendor that is certified.\n\n614\n00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.950\nThe vendor may have made a mistake, but\nin good faith understood that they were\n\n615\n00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.070\ncertified and as a result,\nwe had the assumption, right?\n\n616\n00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.039\nOperationally, that we were being\ncompliant with the letter of the law.\n\n617\n00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.430\n>> Culpability tends to fall on\nthem if they made the mistake.\n\n618\n00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:40.000\nIt's just whoever actually-\n>> It depends.\n\n619\n00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.980\nIt's a very difficult discussion,\nright, because ultimately,\n\n620\n00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.980\nwhile there is culpability in both sides,\nwe also to look at intent right?\n\n621\n00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.590\nIf you purposely set out\nto intend to defraud or\n\n622\n00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.800\npurposely set out to intend to\nexpose that data as the customer and\n\n623\n00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:00.300\nyou don't operate with your\nstandard regulatory rules in play.\n\n624\n00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:02.340\nSo no oversight all that,\n\n625\n00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.970\nthen the blame may very well lay with\nyou as opposed to the cloud vendor.\n\n626\n00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.610\nIf you don't train your people and\nthere's an elemental of that.\n\n627\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:10.940\nThere's a responsibility there\nwith due care and due diligence.\n\n628\n00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:14.290\nYour not training your people and your\njust turning them loose and they violate\n\n629\n00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.200\nthe law It's your responsibility,\nit's not the cloud vendors.\n\n630\n00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.290\nBecause the cloud vendor, the SaaS vendor\ncreated an application that is complaint.\n\n631\n00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.930\nYou didn't do the things that you\nneeded to do to use it securely.\n\n632\n00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:25.510\nThat's not their fault, it's your fault.\n\n633\n00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.880\n>> It's negligence on our part.\n\n634\n00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.130\n>> Essentially right, we would think of\nthat as either culpability or your lack of\n\n635\n00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:35.030\nproper care, there's different terms,\nwe may ultimately see applied to that, but\n\n636\n00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:37.070\nyeah, at the end of the day,\nyou acted negligently, right?\n\n637\n00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:38.080\nYou just didn't do what you had to do.\n\n638\n00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.240\nNow, if you do all that stuff\nwe just talked about, and\n\n639\n00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.740\nyou go into the cloud vendor system,\nand the cloud vendor has a data breach.\n\n640\n00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.560\nNothing to do with you,\nyou're not responsible, right?\n\n641\n00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.290\nBecause you did everything you had to do.\n\n642\n00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.594\nThe implied thought process here, is that\nthe cloud vendor, is supposed to provide\n\n643\n00:31:52.594 --> 00:31:55.727\na level of security, both physical and\nlogical that should protect that data.\n\n644\n00:31:55.727 --> 00:32:00.264\nSo there's gonna be different levels of\nculpability depending on what happens and\n\n645\n00:32:00.264 --> 00:32:04.688\nwhat the mitigating or extenuating\ncircumstances may be around that activity.\n\n646\n00:32:04.688 --> 00:32:08.542\nSo it's not always an easy question\nto answer because there's a story\n\n647\n00:32:08.542 --> 00:32:13.247\nthat has to get unravelled essentially and\ndocumented before we can ascribe blame and\n\n648\n00:32:13.247 --> 00:32:15.630\nreally figure out responsibility here.\n\n649\n00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:18.850\nBecause there may be dual culpability,\nthere may be single culpability meaning\n\n650\n00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.380\none actor acted correctly or not,\nor both acted incorrectly or\n\n651\n00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.540\nthere may be elements on both\nsides that led to the problem, but\n\n652\n00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.030\nsome of those may not be something we can\nactually deal with under the regulation.\n\n653\n00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:33.685\nAnd some maybe, because the regulation may\nnot stipulate that what you did was wrong.\n\n654\n00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:36.585\nEven though, in theory,\nwe know that it was probably negligent.\n\n655\n00:32:36.585 --> 00:32:38.125\nThere may not be a rule that says it was,\nright?\n\n656\n00:32:38.125 --> 00:32:39.005\n>> Right so.\n\n657\n00:32:39.005 --> 00:32:42.105\n>> You did something stupid, we may not be\nable to call you on it versus hey look,\n\n658\n00:32:42.105 --> 00:32:43.825\nthis is on the list of\nstupid things not to do.\n\n659\n00:32:43.825 --> 00:32:44.585\nAnd you did it.\n\n660\n00:32:44.585 --> 00:32:46.907\nSo there's a lot a lot of\nmitigating circumstances there.\n\n661\n00:32:46.907 --> 00:32:48.517\nIt really, it just kinda depends.\n\n662\n00:32:48.517 --> 00:32:50.448\n>> Another list that's getting\nrevised quite often, right?\n\n663\n00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:52.312\n[LAUGH]\n>> Constantly being revoked.\n\n664\n00:32:52.312 --> 00:32:53.155\nThat's like wow.\n\n665\n00:32:53.155 --> 00:32:56.646\nPeople specialize in nothing but\nthat area by the way, and you'll have,\n\n666\n00:32:56.646 --> 00:32:59.087\nsince HIPAA really first\ncame on the scene.\n\n667\n00:32:59.087 --> 00:33:03.197\nAnd when it first came out,\nmuch like Sarbanes-Oxley first came out,\n\n668\n00:33:03.197 --> 00:33:06.437\nit was just page after page of wow,\nwhat does that all mean?\n\n669\n00:33:06.437 --> 00:33:07.690\nAnd nobody's really sure.\n\n670\n00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.400\nAnd there's less of that today.\n\n671\n00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.430\nIt's a lot clearer today how we\nhave to act, what we have to do.\n\n672\n00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:17.660\nBut in the beginning, it was just yeah,\nmaybe we should just stop treating people\n\n673\n00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.640\nand let them get sick, cuz we just don't\nknow how the hell we're gonna do that.\n\n674\n00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.980\nIt was literally like that\nkind of conversation.\n\n675\n00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.710\nBut over time things change, right?\n\n676\n00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.220\nAnd because of that obviously\nwe're getting better at it.\n\n677\n00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.600\nBut the idea of Cloud secure development\nlife cycles overall really is important.\n\n678\n00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.800\nSomething we have to focus on,\nsomething we have to be aware of, and\n\n679\n00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.470\nreally think through the logic of.\n\n680\n00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.210\nI know that we've mentioned,\nin one of our prior episodes,\n\n681\n00:33:39.210 --> 00:33:44.110\nISO 27034 which is the standard for\ninformation technology,\n\n682\n00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.000\nsecurity techniques dealing\nwith application security.\n\n683\n00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.940\nSpecifically part one because\nit's a rather long title.\n\n684\n00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.990\nBut we mentioned ISO 27034.\n\n685\n00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.640\nThat is one of the standard\nguidelines that we look to,\n\n686\n00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.570\none of the standard documents that we\nlook at for guidance in this area.\n\n687\n00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:03.791\nRemember we talked about the fact\nit helps us to define the concepts,\n\n688\n00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:06.511\nthe frameworks and\nthe processes that help us to integrate\n\n689\n00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:09.030\nsecurity into the software\ndevelopment life cycle.\n\n690\n00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.080\nThis is one of the key documents that\nhelps guide us to add that first S\n\n691\n00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.820\non to the SSDLC.\n\n692\n00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.830\nTo add the security oversight and\n\n693\n00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.540\nthe overview into that development\nlife cycle we're talking about.\n\n694\n00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.985\nSo we want to remember that.\n\n695\n00:34:21.985 --> 00:34:24.790\nThere is a list of ISO\ndocuments that we really,\n\n696\n00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:27.105\nas CCSPs,\nshould have working knowledge of.\n\n697\n00:34:27.105 --> 00:34:31.320\nI've kind of thrown a bunch out\nover some episodes here and there.\n\n698\n00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.000\nTalked about ISO 31000,\n\n699\n00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.130\ntalked about ISO 27000,127000,\ntalked about ISO 270034 just now.\n\n700\n00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:43.810\n27,017 and 18 which deal with privacy and\nCloud related data.\n\n701\n00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.780\nWe'll have a kind of an all up list for\nyou.\n\n702\n00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.260\nLet's give her a little booted list and\n\n703\n00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.590\nwe'll just make sure we run through\nthem in one of our upcoming discussions.\n\n704\n00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.300\nBut you wanna make sure you have\na sense of these documents.\n\n705\n00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.560\nYou wanna make sure you have\nan idea of what they represent.\n\n706\n00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.630\nWe talked about the value of\nmissed documents as well, and\n\n707\n00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:02.186\nhow some of them may be important for\nguidance.\n\n708\n00:35:02.186 --> 00:35:05.530\nNIST SP800-53-R4.\n\n709\n00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:10.240\nNIST 837, NIST 839, NIST 800-161 for\nsupply chain risk management.\n\n710\n00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:13.240\nThere's a bunch of guidance out\nthere that's very important.\n\n711\n00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.940\nPCIDSS, understanding\nthe guidance of software there.\n\n712\n00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:17.880\nAnd understanding, by the way,\n\n713\n00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.110\nwith PCIDSS, specifically to the software\ndevelopment cycle and security.\n\n714\n00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:25.140\nPeople often confuse PCIDSS and\ndon't really get\n\n715\n00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.140\nwhat it is versus what they think it is,\nand it's good for you to know,\n\n716\n00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.890\nit's good as CCSPs to understand this,\nhow it relates to the Cloud,\n\n717\n00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:35.635\nit's good for any security\nprofessional to understand this.\n\n718\n00:35:35.635 --> 00:35:37.050\nPCIDSS is not a law.\n\n719\n00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.737\nPeople often look at me and say,\n\n720\n00:35:38.737 --> 00:35:42.030\nwell what do you mean it's not something\nwe gotta do or there's penalties?\n\n721\n00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:43.330\nYeah, it's not a law.\n\n722\n00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.380\nIt's not a regulatory compliance regime.\n\n723\n00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.680\nIt is a group of standards,\na group of guidelines, probably\n\n724\n00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.790\na more accurate way of representing\nit it's a group of guidelines and\n\n725\n00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:58.800\nbest practices that industry, specifically\nthe payment industry has put together\n\n726\n00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.210\nas a set of recommendations that vendors\nthat want to process electronic payments,\n\n727\n00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:07.210\nuse credit cards essentially,\nto take and receive payments,\n\n728\n00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:11.980\nhave to follow if they want to be able to\nuse the credit cards that are essentially\n\n729\n00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:15.380\npart of the consortium, AmEx,\nVISA, Master Card, whatever.\n\n730\n00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.652\nIf you wanna use their cards,\nyou gotta play by their rules.\n\n731\n00:36:18.652 --> 00:36:21.975\nBut there's no law in the United State,\nor anywhere else,\n\n732\n00:36:21.975 --> 00:36:27.472\nthat says PCIDSS must be done or\nyou are gonna go to jail.\n\n733\n00:36:27.472 --> 00:36:31.309\nIt's just that they don't allow you to\nuse their payment processing systems.\n\n734\n00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:33.690\nThey, being the trade group and\nthe vendors,\n\n735\n00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.370\nthey don't let you do it unless you agree\nto essentially play by their rules.\n\n736\n00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:40.600\nSo from their perspective,\nyeah, it's regulatory, right?\n\n737\n00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.320\nIt's they want you to do it.\n\n738\n00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.400\nBut the reality is that hasn't risen\nto the actual level of a law in one or\n\n739\n00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.010\nmore countries.\n\n740\n00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.530\nIt's just best practice\nrecommendations and guidance.\n\n741\n00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:52.190\nNow when we look at\nsomething like that and\n\n742\n00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.400\nwe are then aligned with that,\nwe then understand that we need\n\n743\n00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.640\nto develop software that will allow us\nto act securely to process payments.\n\n744\n00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.100\nAnd so we work with those trade groups and\nthose entities to do so,\n\n745\n00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.920\nwe implement chip and pin technology and\nall the things we do to do that.\n\n746\n00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:11.080\nBut the reality is that may be\nan outcome of that group of guidance and\n\n747\n00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:15.290\nbest practice recommendations that may or\nmay not have the force of law.\n\n748\n00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:19.297\nSo we do wanna understand how some of\nthese things come together, and using\n\n749\n00:37:19.297 --> 00:37:23.879\nSDLC's software and, or system developing\nlife cycles to drive risk management and\n\n750\n00:37:23.879 --> 00:37:26.890\ndrive awareness becomes very,\nvery important for us.\n\n751\n00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:28.910\nWe do have to think about\nthe impact of that.\n\n752\n00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:32.280\n>> That's right, and that's our job,\nthat's what we're trying to do.\n\n753\n00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.660\nWe're trying to help our developers, A,\ndevelop software that's gonna be secure,\n\n754\n00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.720\nlike Adam said, that's gonna contribute\nto the security of our systems and\n\n755\n00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.200\nnot detract from it.\n\n756\n00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.480\nAnd then, it's our job to make sure\nthat they actually did that training.\n\n757\n00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.900\nWe're gonna go back in and follow through.\n\n758\n00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.940\nDid you actually implement these security\nmeasures that we're telling you that we\n\n759\n00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.050\nwant to have that helps keep\nour environment secure?\n\n760\n00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.625\nAnd kinda hold their feet to the fire\na little bit which is always fun.\n\n761\n00:37:56.625 --> 00:37:57.260\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n762\n00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:57.870\n>> That being said [LAUGH].\n\n763\n00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.230\n>> Yes, especially when they\ncrisp up around the edges.\n\n764\n00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.910\nThat's always good stuff.\n\n765\n00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:03.320\n>> Yeah, always watching the bubbly,\ncrispy parts.\n\n766\n00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.090\nThat being said,\n\n767\n00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:08.080\nit looks like we've come to the end of\nanother great episode here at ITProTV.\n\n768\n00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.700\nAdam, we do thank you for stopping by.\n\n769\n00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.890\n>> No problem.\n>> And lending your expertise on this.\n\n770\n00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.330\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n771\n00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.932\nWe're gonna sign off for ITProTV.\n\n772\n00:38:14.932 --> 00:38:17.160\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n773\n00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.250\n>> I

ITProTV.\n\n00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:20.700\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie, and\ntoday's episode we are continuing with our\n\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.100\nCertified Cloud Security Professional\nseries.\n\n00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.230\nJoining us back in the studio again for\na part two on software validation and\n\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.510\nassurance is our good friend,\nMr Adam Gordon.\n\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.625\nAdam, welcome back,\nhow are you doing today?\n\n00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:34.310\n>> I'm good, I'm good,\nand I know I'm here and\n\n00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.380\nI am actually myself because I checked,\nI verified and validated before I came on.\n\n00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.220\nYou have to do that off camera cuz it's,\n\n00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.270\nyou know,\nyou can't just do that stuff on camera.\n\n00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.830\nThat's on the list of things you're not\nsupposed to do, it's one of those things.\n\n00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.460\nAnyway, so we're going to continue\ntalking about verification and\n\n00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.920\nvalidation assurance essentially.\n\n00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.672\nYeah how do we know code is good?\n\n00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:56.396\nHow do we know that the applications\nthat we're running are not going to be\n\n00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:57.650\nrisk laden?\n\n00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.410\nAnd how are we going to be\nrisk adverse as good CCSPs?\n\n00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.129\nWe've been talking about the secure\ndevelopment life cycles that we wanna see\n\n00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.200\nwith software and systems, specifically\nthe cloud security development life cycle,\n\n00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.540\nthat ISO 27034 helps us to represent,\nand ultimately helps us to think about.\n\n00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.480\nWe've talked about the importance of\nthis in a couple of different ares, and\n\n00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.560\nthe fact that the guidance that may be in\na document like this will be valuable for\n\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.990\nus, as security professionals,\nto consider.\n\n00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.500\nWhat I've asked Daniel to do before\nwe get started is to go ahead and\n\n00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.570\npull back up the ISO standard.\n\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.540\nWe've showed it to you\na couple of different times.\n\n00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.510\nWe're gonna go back into it specifically\nnow, before we go to a portion and\n\n00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.150\ndrill down a little bit to show you\n\n00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.500\nsome specific information in there\nthat will be of interest to you.\n\n00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.630\nSo can we take a look at your screen,\nand we can see the ISO document.\n\n00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.250\nAnd I know I asked you to call out\nspecifically and maybe zoom in quickly so\n\n00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.870\nthey can see the area inside.\n\n00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.609\nThis is on the preview page, right, for\n\n00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.370\nthe ISO standard that you can get\nto by going to the main library,\n\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.412\nthen click in that preview button\nwe've shown you in prior episodes.\n\n00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:58.666\nAnd we're gonna drill down,\n\n00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:01.825\nwe're not gonna show it to you in\nthe document itself but rather extract out\n\n00:02:01.825 --> 00:02:04.911\nthe graphic that we'll then talk\nabout that relates to these concepts.\n\n00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:09.547\nBut in section eight as you can see, where\nDaniel's hovering there, we could see that\n\n00:02:09.547 --> 00:02:14.440\nunder concepts we have something known as\n8.1 the Organization Normative Framework.\n\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.460\n8.2, the Application Risk Assessment.\n\n00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.320\n8.3, Application Normative Framework, and\n\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.315\nthen provisioning those frameworks out and\noperating the application.\n\n00:02:24.315 --> 00:02:27.745\nAnd what we're gonna do is drill in and\ntalk about the ONF and drill in and\n\n00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:30.755\ntalk about the ANF,\nthe Application Normative Framework, and\n\n00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:34.385\nhow that comes together under\nthe ASMP which is right above it\n\n00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:37.135\nin 7.3 the Application\nSecurity Management Process.\n\n00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:40.277\nWe're gonna break all that down for\nyou and explain a little bit about that.\n\n00:02:40.277 --> 00:02:44.309\nDaniel's actually got a nice picture\nthat he went out and found for us.\n\n00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:48.200\nSo we're gonna just let him zoom back out,\nzoom back and anyone take a look at that.\n\n00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.909\nThat is from the Web, correct?\n\n00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.480\n>> Mm-hm, yeah,\nwe just did a Google search for this and\n\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.470\nfound it in their images search.\n\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.244\n>> Not one of your homegrown specials.\n\n00:02:54.244 --> 00:02:55.460\n>> Not one of our homegrown specials.\n\n00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.590\n>> Okay, all right, so wanna make sure we\nknow that anybody out there, in theory,\n\n00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.802\ncould go out and look for this.\n\n00:02:59.802 --> 00:03:01.550\n>> This is the site it comes from.\n\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.730\n>> Yeah, and this graphic, by the way,\nis from the ISO-Standard, so\n\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.420\nthis is actually what you will see.\n\n00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.560\nIf you go in and\ntake a look at the the ISO-Standard.\n\n00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.360\nBut we're going to zoom in,\n\n00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.300\nobviously as you really can't see\nanything in the level of detail.\n\n00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.100\nThere that's much better.\n\n00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.700\nThat we can see and take a look at.\n\n00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.350\nSo what we want to do is to be\nable to see what's going on there.\n\n00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.484\nAnd so\nwhat we're going to do is just talk for\n\n00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:22.872\na couple of minutes about\nthe moving parts here.\n\n00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:26.740\nWe wanna talk about the Organizational\nNormative Framework first.\n\n00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.435\nWhich is on the left hand side of\nthe diagram, what's called the ONF.\n\n00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:32.596\nWe're gonna break that down,\nexplain what that is.\n\n00:03:32.596 --> 00:03:36.444\nThen we wanna go ahead and wanna take a\nlook at the ANF on the right, which is at\n\n00:03:36.444 --> 00:03:40.134\nthe top of the other silo there,\nthe Application Normative Framework.\n\n00:03:40.134 --> 00:03:44.176\nAnd then we're gonna go ahead and join and\nthem all together and just talk about them\n\n00:03:44.176 --> 00:03:47.887\nin the context of the ASMP, the\nApplication Security Management Process.\n\n00:03:47.887 --> 00:03:51.370\nWhich is what's diagrammed on the picture,\nthe whole thing so\n\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.500\nto speak all brought together at once.\n\n00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.595\nSo let's start with\nthe ONF off to the left,\n\n00:03:55.595 --> 00:04:01.705\nthe Organizational Normative Framework\nis gonna lay out this componentized or\n\n00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:06.750\nindividual modularized view of all the\nbuilding blocks that we need to have, from\n\n00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.620\nthe security best practices standpoint\nwith regards to the application.\n\n00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.530\nSo, we see under the ONF\nbanner up at the top.\n\n00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.175\nOn the-- whoops going the wrong way.\n\n00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:16.934\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On that side [LAUGH] up there, right?\n\n00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:18.300\n>> The non.\n\n00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.141\n>> Non-mirror image.\n\n00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.819\n>> Anyway, off to the left you know\non the screen that whole thing on\n\n00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:23.230\nthe left that says ONF.\n\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.300\nUnderneath the Organization\nNormative Framework.\n\n00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.130\nI am so\ndirectionally challenged it is not funny.\n\n00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.830\nI'm surprised I get out\nof bed in the morning and\n\n00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.360\nactually find my way out of the house.\n\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.258\n>> We have to turn him toward\nthe cameras when we start the day.\n\n00:04:32.258 --> 00:04:34.460\n>> You know,\nthis happens every time I present.\n\n00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.150\nBecause intuitively it's\nthe exact opposite.\n\n00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.360\nRight?\nSo intuitively you're saying\n\n00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.540\nyou want to go to the left, so you're\ngoing this way, but unless you have a hand\n\n00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.240\nthat comes on the screen on the other\nside, it's just not working.\n\n00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.220\nAnd so you say you want to go to the left,\nbut then you get the idea.\n\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.500\nSo we're not gonna review\nthat whole thing again.\n\n00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.760\nAnyway, so\nthe Organizational Normative Framework.\n\n00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.430\nSo on the left underneath that banner,\n\n00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.900\nwe see the business context in\none of the rectangles there.\n\n00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.290\nWe're gonna see the regulatory context.\n\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.390\nWe see the technical context\nkind of scrolling down there.\n\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.690\nOn the right hand side we see the\nspecifications, the roles, the processes.\n\n00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.830\nWe see the application security\ncontrol library underneath that.\n\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.800\nAll of these are elements that\nhave to be described, identified.\n\n00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.560\nProgrammed in, built into the application,\nand then contended with.\n\n00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.190\nWith regards to understanding these\nrequirements, where they're coming from,\n\n00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.190\nwhat is the business context,\nwhat is important to the business,\n\n00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.440\nwhat are the business\nrequirements essentially.\n\n00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.320\nThat we have to build in, the\nnonfunctional and functional requirements,\n\n00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.500\nright, that are gonna be part\nof the application development.\n\n00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.680\nWhat are the regulatory contexts,\nif there are any?\n\n00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.470\nWhat are the laws, the statutory issues,\nthe concerns, we have to align with in\n\n00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.730\norder to make sure this application\nis going to be legal to use,\n\n00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.280\nthat it's gonna support the proper\nimplementation of risk management,\n\n00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.990\nand all the things we would\nhave to contend with?\n\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.790\nIf this was a Or\nHIPAA based compliant application,\n\n00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.200\nthere will be very different regulatory\ncontexts that we would have to build in\n\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.690\nbecause under Sabines Oxley in the United\nStates we have a very different focus\n\n00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.500\nthan under HIPAA,\nwe both are focused on in both areas.\n\n00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.730\nThe transparency and\nmanagement of information, but\n\n00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.440\nalso the confidentiality\nof certain information.\n\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.150\nAnd so we have to understand\nhow to play those context and\n\n00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.800\nregulatory concerns off and identify them\nso that we then can program against them.\n\n00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.470\nThe tactical context,\nwhat are the technologies?\n\n00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.460\nWhat are going to be the choices we make,\nthe languages we use?\n\n00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.920\nSo, the programmatic languages.\n\n00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.510\nSecure versus insecure libraries,\nthings of that nature.\n\n00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.290\nThe specifications.\n\n00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.400\nSo as I said functional, non-functional.\n\n00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.700\nOff to the right will be detailed there.\n\n00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.660\nWhat are the roles that\nwe're gonna envision?\n\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.560\nWhat are the processes we're gonna use?\n\n00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.250\nWhat are the application security\ncontrols that will be brought to bear and\n\n00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.140\nprogrammed in?\n\n00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.820\nThese are all part of\nthe organizational normative framework.\n\n00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:50.840\nAll The pieces that we have\nto identify and coordinate so\n\n00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:56.600\nthat way we understand exactly what\nthe structure of the contending and\n\n00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.960\ncompetitive things are that have\nto be taken into account and\n\n00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.960\nbuilt into and ultimately addressed,\nto create a secure application but\n\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.430\none that also is business aligned that\nsupports the needs of the business.\n\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.160\nOn the right hand side, we see\nthe Application Normative Framework,\n\n00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.500\nwhat's called the ANF, on the right.\n\n00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.192\nThe ANF is gonna essentially maintain and\nsupport the applicable portions of the ONF\n\n00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:20.988\non the left, so we're bringing over the\napplicable business context requirements,\n\n00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:24.316\nthe applicable business context\nrequirements, the regulatory context,\n\n00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:25.411\nthe technical context.\n\n00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:28.502\nWe're dragging those things\nover from the master list\n\n00:07:28.502 --> 00:07:33.354\nof things that have been decided on or at\nleast identified as potentially impactful.\n\n00:07:33.354 --> 00:07:38.139\nWe're gonna maintain and address those\nspecific things so that way we can achieve\n\n00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:42.784\nwhatever required level of security or\nwhatever targeted level of trust that is\n\n00:07:42.784 --> 00:07:46.870\nthe language that ISO uses has to\nbe applied to the application.\n\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.885\nSo as we look on the right,\nwe also see the business context,\n\n00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:52.739\nwe see the regulatory context,\nthe technical context.\n\n00:07:52.739 --> 00:07:57.247\nWe see the specifications, the roles,\nthe processes, and the application, or\n\n00:07:57.247 --> 00:08:01.908\nthe applicable security controls,\nall there, essentially reproduced, right?\n\n00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:06.622\nFrom the organizational normative\nframework, brought over and scope and\n\n00:08:06.622 --> 00:08:07.490\ntailor it.\n\n00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.540\nI really gotta make sure I have more\n\n00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.300\nthan one cup of coffee in\nthe morning before we start talking.\n\n00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.950\nScoping and tailoring all of that\nto ensure that we are filtering and\n\n00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.135\nfocusing our efforts onto\nthe very specific requirements\n\n00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:26.755\nnecessary to ensure the appropriate level\nof security and the appropriate level of\n\n00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:30.415\ntrust that this application is\ngonna have to operate within.\n\n00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:34.555\nSo taking a broad set of requirements and\nneeds and we are narrowing them down\n\n00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:38.870\nfrom the ONF which is the broad\ncontainer all things we need to address.\n\n00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:43.410\nInto the ANF, which is gonna then\nscope and tailor, narrowly define\n\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:48.600\nthe specificity required to achieve the\ndesired level of security, or the desired\n\n00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.300\nlevel of trust and protection that this\napplication will ultimately provide.\n\n00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.530\nAnd notice we've broadened\nthat out into the ASNP,\n\n00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.420\nthe application security\nmanagement process.\n\n00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.620\nThis entire area.\n\n00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.840\nCan we go out and\nme into full screen for a minute so\n\n00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.530\nthat we can see the off They have\njust see, I wanna see that part.\n\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:08.550\nCan we scroll down just a smidge\n>> No, no, no don't scroll down.\n\n00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.400\nNow up.\n\n00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.980\nYeah.\n>> There you go.\n\n00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.683\n>> Yeah, even I know that.\n\n00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:13.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> As directly challenges, I am.\n\n00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.200\nI know what up and down are.\n\n00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.265\n>> Our Macs are backwards.\n\n00:09:15.265 --> 00:09:16.695\n[LAUGH]\n>> Turn them sideways.\n\n00:09:16.695 --> 00:09:17.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I\n\n00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.100\njust wanna be able to see\nthe bottom box on the right for.\n\n00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.500\nProduct and application was\nkind of hidden, so that's why.\n\n00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:23.240\nSo no, we're good right there.\n\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.110\nSo we could see on the left, right?\n\n00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.120\nThe organizational management process.\n\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.340\nThe all up container\nthat the ONF exists in,\n\n00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.320\nis the organization management process.\n\n00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.250\nWhat's called the OMP, by the way.\n\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.180\nIt's the upper, Item that is described\nin the container above the ONF.\n\n00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.920\nWe don't want to knock that off\nthe table that would be bad.\n\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.310\nAnd then off to the right we see the\napplication security management process.\n\n00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:50.220\nThe ASMP, which is the all up container\nthat the ANF, on the right sits within.\n\n00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.330\nAnd we're talking specifically\nabout the ASMP now.\n\n00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:57.680\nThe application security management\nprocess is the process that wraps the ANF.\n\n00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.120\nAnd allows us to be able to\n\n00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.885\ndefine requirements by distilling\ndown what the ANF represents,\n\n00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:08.760\nthen taking the application requirements\nand applying them, ultimately.\n\n00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.460\nSo that way, if you look at the logic\nflow, as we come down, right?\n\n00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.830\nWe're seeing that we,\nstill down from the ANF,\n\n00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.680\ncan you just kind of hover over the first\ndiamond above there in the middle,\n\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:20.660\nright, so\nwe're kind of at a logic flow there.\n\n00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.540\nWe're looking at a decision point right,\nor\n\n00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.140\nwe're seeing, we are defining\nrequirements coming down through the ANF\n\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:30.400\ninto the application project and\nthen from the application project.\n\n00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.730\nNotice that we have a link that\ngoes out and over to the OMF inside\n\n00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.820\nthe organization management process, but\nalso a link that goes directly down.\n\n00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.800\nAnd from that link coming\ndown out of the ASMP,\n\n00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:44.380\nwe see that we are producing\nsecure applications, right?\n\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.210\nAs it says.\n\n00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.630\nAnd essentially, the product or\n\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:50.990\napplication at the bottom is gonna be\na result of all of the requirements and\n\n00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:54.550\nthe specific security needs and\nconcerns and trust overlay\n\n00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:59.150\nto then yield an application that acts in\nthe most appropriate, most secure manner.\n\n00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.680\nSo this is the life cycle,\n\n00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:06.660\nthis is the thought process that the ISO\n27,034 document lays out for us.\n\n00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.430\nIt's very important for\nus as CCSPs to understand this life cycle.\n\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:14.900\nWe really have to embrace this and\nunderstand the implications of this,\n\n00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.700\nbecause if we're able to create secure\napplications, scaled to the appropriate\n\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.730\nlevel of trust and security requirements\nthat are business requirements,\n\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.500\nare regulatory requirements and\nour tactical choices allow us to deliver\n\n00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.180\nto meet the functional requirements that\nare specified for protection and security.\n\n00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.910\nWe are essentially delivering the right\n\n00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.860\nkind of application to manatrists\ndown in the organization.\n\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.200\nThis is a functional, this is\na tactical approach to risk management.\n\n00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.140\nWe're distilling risk management down\nInto the application development process.\n\n00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:52.150\nSo in the SDLC, the way we add\nthe security element in is by doing or\n\n00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.330\nachieving and executing some\nsort of an approach like this.\n\n00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.370\nNow this is not the only one.\n\n00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.000\nAnd this is not the only way.\n\n00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.320\nBut this is the one that ISO 27034\nlays out with their language,\n\n00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.480\ntheir moving parts.\n\n00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.320\nAnd we want to be aware of\nCCSPs of this guidance.\n\n00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.410\nWe may very well get asked\nabout it at some point.\n\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.310\nWe may get asked,\nwhat is the ANF, what is the ONF?\n\n00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:13.220\nHow do the ONF and the ANF interact?\n\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.710\nWhat is the ASMP?\n\n00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.400\nWhat is it made up off?\n\n00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.590\nYou should be aware of these questions.\n\n00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.250\nYou should be able to answer\nthese questions based on our\n\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.570\nexplanation just now.\n\n00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.400\nAnd based on its referencing\nthe ISO 27034 standard.\n\n00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:27.510\nAnd if you're not comfortable with this,\nI get that.\n\n00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:28.900\nThere's no shame in that at all.\n\n00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.430\nA lot of us do not do this kind of\napplication development work as a primary\n\n00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.110\nfocus of our security interaction with\nthe business and the things we do.\n\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.290\nOn the security side.\n\n00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.700\nYou just have to do a little studying.\n\n00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.890\nYou have to pay attention.\n\n00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.850\nGood news, as Daniel pointed\nout in a prior episode is.\n\n00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.200\nIs this is all recorded.\n\n00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.250\nRight, so if your not watching live you\nalways have the option of to go back and\n\n00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.860\nreview as many times as necessary.\n\n00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.830\nEven if you are watching live\nyou can go back, at that point,\n\n00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:53.880\nlook at the episode once\nit's put up ultimately.\n\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.440\nAnd the shows are finished.\n\n00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.610\nYou can review that as often as necessary.\n\n00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:00.780\nYou remember, as I've made clear,\ndo not need to go out and\n\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.550\nbuy the ISO standard in order\nto be able to study for\n\n00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:06.660\nthe exam, you just have to make sure\nyou understand the relevant portions\n\n00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.390\nthat we're distilling down presenting and\ntalking to you about here.\n\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.360\nBut it is really important for\nyou to understand the ISO framework for\n\n00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.490\nsecure application development and\nISO 27034 helps to represent that for you.\n\n00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.190\nWith regards,\nnot just to secure development, but\n\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.650\nalso, hey we've done that.\n\n00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:24.740\nBut how do we validate that,\nright, the flip side of that?\n\n00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.580\nNow the end result of that is, we've gotta\ngo through a series of testing regimes.\n\n00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.770\nApplication security testing, and\nfunctional and nonfunctional testing, and\n\n00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:36.650\nall sorts of additional testing solutions\nare gonna become very critical here.\n\n00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.970\nWe're gonna take a look at\ndifferent testing types,\n\n00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.580\nstatic application security testing,\n\n00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.830\nwhat's called SAST Dynamic Applications\nSecurity Testing which is called DAST.\n\n00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.100\nWe'll take a look at RAST, something else\nyou may or may not be familiar with.\n\n00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.140\nVulnerability assessments and pin testing.\n\n00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.230\nWe'll talk about the OWASP\ntesting guide version four and\n\n00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.412\nthe recommendations we find there and\nthe different categories of tests.\n\n00:13:56.412 --> 00:13:59.100\nThat OWASP recommends\nthat we actually run.\n\n00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.210\nSo we're gonna have a lot to say about\nthat in the next couple of minutes, but\n\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.900\nremember that on the back end here as\nwe do this secure development as we\n\n00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.880\nessentially enable to ONF the ANF\nthe ASMP and we spit out at the bottom\n\n00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.300\na secure app, that's only the beginning of\nthe journey right that's the first stage.\n\n00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.970\nWe now have to verify and\nvalidate that application.\n\n00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.100\nAnd we're doing that all along\nthe way at various phases, but\n\n00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.870\nwe have do that all up when\nthe application is done as well\n\n00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.180\nto ensure that all the moving parts\nultimately equal a secure solution.\n\n00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:29.980\nSo we're gonna talk about how\nwe're gonna do that right now or\n\n00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.000\nat least delve into that a little bit.\n\n00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.840\nI love talking about application testing,\n\n00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.880\napplication security testing in\nparticular because it's one of the things\n\n00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.330\nthat unlike application development,\na CSSP can actually interact with,\n\n00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.160\ncan actually understand,\ncan actually put their hands on.\n\n00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.100\nAnd can see first hand and experience,\nand can play an active role in,\n\n00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.440\nbecause we can understand how to do this.\n\n00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.900\nEven though we may not do it cuz it's\nnot as complex as code development.\n\n00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.670\nIt's a relatively straightforward\nprocess for the most part.\n\n00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.170\nWhen we talk about static\napplication testing,\n\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.100\nwe're talking about looking at the code.\n\n00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.210\nEssentially decompiling and\n\n00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.880\nbreaking it down,\nopening up the application line by line.\n\n00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.770\nWe use automated tools and\nsuites of tools to do this.\n\n00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.640\nThis is not you sitting with a 10,000 page\nprint-out going line by line going, yep,\n\n00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.210\nthat looks good.\n\n00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.810\nLet me check that off, right?\n\n00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.720\nI mean, in the old days you may\nhave literally done that, but\n\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.210\nthese days we actually use\nautomatic testing tools to do this.\n\n00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:26.210\nBut we opened up the code,\nwe feed it in to a testing solution and\n\n00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.770\nwe don't actually execute the program.\n\n00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.200\nThat's the key differentiator\nbetween SAS and DAS.\n\n00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.530\nStatic testing does not imply\nthe application will be executed.\n\n00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:39.800\nIt implies rather, we're gonna manually\nreview or go through automated.\n\n00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.190\nBut essentially line by\nline review the code.\n\n00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.650\nSo we're not gonna execute the code.\n\n00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.408\nBut we are gonna look at the integrity and\nthe validity and\n\n00:15:45.408 --> 00:15:48.341\nthe validation of each line of\ncode to ensure that it does what\n\n00:15:48.341 --> 00:15:51.233\nit's supposed to do both individually and\ncollectively.\n\n00:15:51.233 --> 00:15:55.410\nSo we're gonna call this traditionally\na white box test that's what SaaS is often\n\n00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.920\nreferred to as white box testing as\nopposed to gray box or black box and\n\n00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.994\nwe can obviously differentiate there.\n\n00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:04.398\nBut the idea is that we analyze\nthe application source code line by line\n\n00:16:04.398 --> 00:16:07.178\nWe don't go through and\nactually execute the binaries.\n\n00:16:07.178 --> 00:16:09.520\nWe just open everything up and\nwe look at it.\n\n00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.540\nWe may use automated testing\ntools to do this as I said and\n\n00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:14.160\nwe determine coding errors.\n\n00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.520\nSo we find loops that may\nnot be closed out properly.\n\n00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.200\nWe find statements that may\nnot actually make sense.\n\n00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.520\nWe find any kind of syntax or\ngrammatical and, or coding base errors.\n\n00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.560\nOr omissions where yet we said, we gonna\ndo this five things, and we look and\n\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.700\nwe only do four.\n\n00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:33.780\nCuz when you're writing five lines\nof code, it's easy to get it right.\n\n00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.720\nWhen you're writing 5 million,\nthere's probably a very high likelihood\n\n00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.540\nthere's gonna be an error\nsomewhere in there.\n\n00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:39.951\nSo as a result we have to understand that.\n\n00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:43.974\nAnd we're gonna then look specifically\nwith these testing tools for\n\n00:16:43.974 --> 00:16:47.100\nissues and\nconcerns that are security based.\n\n00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:52.850\nAre we exposing data, for instance, by\nviolating rule number two on the OAS web\n\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.880\napplications security vulnerability list,\nwhich is to be using hard coded or\n\n00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.980\nbuilt in references to either\ncredentials and, or paths in the system?\n\n00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.900\nSo that way, somebody could look at\nthe code and find that information.\n\n00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.200\nWe'd wanna scrub all that out.\n\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.462\nThat would be a security vulnerability.\n\n00:17:07.462 --> 00:17:10.330\nWe wanna look at item\nnumber A1 on that list.\n\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.910\nAnd look at injection concerns,\nand look at whether or\n\n00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:16.250\nnot we have the potential for\nsome sort of SQL injection or\n\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:19.780\nbuffer overflow or export attack\nbecause of the nature of the code and\n\n00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.280\nthe fact that we're not doing input\nvalidation and boundary checking.\n\n00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.810\nAnd because of that we may have a problem.\n\n00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.830\nSo SAST can help us to do these things.\n\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.950\nIt will help us to find XSS,\ncross side scripting concerns.\n\n00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:34.910\nHelps us to find injection concerns cuz we\ncan look at the structure of the code and\n\n00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:38.370\nbecause of the understanding of\nthe concerns, the exploits and\n\n00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.360\nhow they are structured,\n\n00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:43.280\nhow they work, we can see those issues\nactually represented in the code.\n\n00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.100\nIt's kinda like looking at the matrix.\n\n00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.850\n>> Is that done where it's actual\npeople looking at code and\n\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.947\njust basically verifying\nthat everything's right or\n\n00:17:50.947 --> 00:17:54.132\ndo we use some sort of automation\nsoftware for that process?\n\n00:17:54.132 --> 00:17:57.639\n>> So we traditionally will\nuse automation software,\n\n00:17:57.639 --> 00:18:02.550\nwhich will come back and\nflag 30 instances of concerns or whatever.\n\n00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.300\nCreate essentially a bug report,\nit splits out a report.\n\n00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.300\nAnd then,\nyou can go through after the fact.\n\n00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.649\nAnd literally and highlight and say look,\nline five, and you'll go right there.\n\n00:18:10.649 --> 00:18:14.590\nIt has all those features,\nthose search features, things like that.\n\n00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.190\nMost of the automated engines\ntoday that we use can do this.\n\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:20.570\nThis actually can be done as a Cloud-based\nservice by the way, you could do this\n\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.540\non or through the Cloud, you could upload\nyour code to a third party provider,\n\n00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.570\nactually have an automated\ntesting engine run through it,\n\n00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:29.830\na lot of companies don't do that cuz\nthey don't wanna expose their code.\n\n00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:34.200\nBut if you don't have the in house built\nin capabilities and tool sets you actually\n\n00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.300\ncan do this as a service today so\nthe Cloud helps us to actually validate\n\n00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.700\nthe software and verify the software that\nwill be used in the Cloud, it's kinda\n\n00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.120\ninteresting that we could do that,\nbut SAS testing can be done this way.\n\n00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.818\nIn the old days this would've been a human\nsitting at a screen looking at every line,\n\n00:18:47.818 --> 00:18:49.830\ntoday the reality is the code base is so\n\n00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.730\nbig traditionally,\nit's very hard to do it that way.\n\n00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:56.490\nSo we run the automated testing engine,\nand then flag the bug report and\n\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.120\nessentially go through and\ndeal with bug report.\n\n00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.630\nAnd that's more often than not, how we\ndo that on the staff side specifically.\n\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.540\nWith DAST,\nDynamic Application Security Testing,\n\n00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.360\nwhat we're doing there, by the way,\noften referred to as a black box test.\n\n00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.310\nSo SAST,\nyou wanna know is white box testing.\n\n00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.150\nDAST, you wanna know is black box testing.\n\n00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.400\nJust as a point of reference,\nwe actually are gonna go out and\n\n00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.270\nlook at individual execution\npaths in the application.\n\n00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.900\nSo we're gonna run that application.\n\n00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.520\nWe're gonna fire up Word,\nwinword.exe or explorer.exe or\n\n00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.240\nwhatever it is, and we're gonna look at it\nin a controlled, sandboxed environment.\n\n00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.635\nSo we're gonna essentially isolate that,\nso we're not potentially gonna have\n\n00:19:34.635 --> 00:19:39.295\na problem with the code if there is an\nissue or a violation or a concern found.\n\n00:19:39.295 --> 00:19:42.615\nBut we're gonna run the code and we're\ngonna look at how the code is running.\n\n00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:46.200\nWe're gonna examine individual\nexecution paths in the application.\n\n00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.260\nProbe again with remote and with automated\ntool sets to be able to do this.\n\n00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.940\nSo that way we look at everything\nthe application's doing.\n\n00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.500\nGo to the DLL its calling.\n\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.170\nWhat are the dependencies it has?\n\n00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.600\nWhat processes is it spawning?\n\n00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.660\nHow is it accessing memory?\n\n00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.830\nHow is it buffering?\n\n00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.100\nHow is it caching?\n\n00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.420\nHow is it writing to the drive?\n\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.290\nAll these concerns.\n\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:06.680\nEverything we would look at there.\n\n00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.580\nWe're gonna analyze the code but\nit's not analyzed offline the way SAST\n\n00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.850\nanalyzes it statically\nwithout executing it.\n\n00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.342\nWe're actually doing it dynamically in\nmemory in real time in the running state.\n\n00:20:16.342 --> 00:20:19.100\nWe wanna make sure we\nunderstand how this is working.\n\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:23.500\nThis is gonna help us to understand not\njust the hey, you've got a bad line of\n\n00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.610\ncode on line five execution issue, or\nrather your code vulnerability, but rather\n\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.410\nhey, we're calling five other programs and\nall of the sudden we have a memory leak.\n\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:34.390\nAnd so, that's now a major issue.\n\n00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:36.320\nAnd we're gonna see those in real time.\n\n00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.300\nIn a sense that we're gonna\nunderstand how this is working\n\n00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.900\nin the actual run time itself.\n\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.630\nSo were gonna be looking at that.\n\n00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:46.370\nSo that's going to be looking\nat how the application executes.\n\n00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.150\nNow, I just mentioned run\ntime a minute ago and\n\n00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:50.390\nI said we're also gonna talk\nabout a testing type or\n\n00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:53.960\na solution that allows us to validate\ncode and verify called RASP.\n\n00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.460\nWhich is also something that you will\nhear about and you should, as a CCSP,\n\n00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.480\nhave knowledge of.\n\n00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.800\nThis is called\nRuntime Application Self-Protection.\n\n00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.750\nAnd the idea with RASP is\nthat we're focusing on\n\n00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:08.500\nthe ability of the applications that\nare built to have self-protection and\n\n00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.990\nreally see, because not all applications\nare built this way first of all, so\n\n00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.950\nnot all applications can be using RASP.\n\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.490\nBut the newer ones that are that\nare self-healing and have self-protection\n\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:22.630\ncapabilities, where they can modify their\ncode or in some way change out their code\n\n00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.610\nto reflect that an attack has happened and\nto swap out bad files back for good.\n\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:32.260\nSo for instance, in the Microsoft Windows\noperating system, since probably\n\n00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:37.600\nWindows Vista and certainly in Windows\n7 and Windows 8, 8.1, Windows 10,\n\n00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.500\nwe have self healing capabilities,\nwe have this in Microsoft Office.\n\n00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:45.724\nSince I think 2007 or Office 2010 as well,\nwhere the system can pull back down DLLs\n\n00:21:45.724 --> 00:21:49.710\nand essentially fix itself if we find\nthere's been an error in the code.\n\n00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:53.510\nWe can do this and we have self-protection\ncapabilities built into the runtime\n\n00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.380\nenvironments of certain applications and\n\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:22:00.180\nif we do that, we're gonna be able to\nessentially see the application logic,\n\n00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:05.390\nthe data flow, the event information,\nand track event flows.\n\n00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:09.460\nAnd we prevent attacks by\nreconfiguring the application or\n\n00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.950\nchanging it on the fly automatically.\n\n00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.540\nThis is almost like an IPS, and\nintrusion prevention system, being used.\n\n00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.400\nBut it's the application itself,\nthat's the IPS.\n\n00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.771\nAnd as I go to attack the application,\nthe application reconfigures and\n\n00:22:22.771 --> 00:22:27.116\nas such it creates a, defends a perimeter\naround itself, preventing the malware or\n\n00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:30.370\npreventing the bad act or\nwhatever from gaining control.\n\n00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:34.330\nAnd that way we don't have to\nworry about faults or threats and\n\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.445\nhaving to respond to them ourselves\nbecause we may be too slow.\n\n00:22:37.445 --> 00:22:39.905\nThe application can actually\ndo that on our behalf.\n\n00:22:39.905 --> 00:22:42.945\nSo this is runtime application\nself-protection called RASP.\n\n00:22:42.945 --> 00:22:45.405\nThis is a newer thought-process,\nnewer concept but\n\n00:22:45.405 --> 00:22:49.123\nwe actually can use this as an additional\nlayer of verification and validation,\n\n00:22:49.123 --> 00:22:52.532\nas well, which actually if you think\nabout it is pretty cool technology.\n\n00:22:52.532 --> 00:22:56.770\nSo when we can do stuff like this or\nbuild this into our applications,\n\n00:22:56.770 --> 00:23:02.350\nwe actually ultimately or thinking about\nthe ways in which applications can become,\n\n00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:06.660\nindependent of the human host, and\ncan respond in real time, to threats.\n\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.670\nAnd this is really what we\nare ultimately striving for.\n\n00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:10.844\nAnd this is ultimately how\nSkynet got started, as well-\n\n00:23:10.844 --> 00:23:12.107\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n00:23:12.107 --> 00:23:13.204\n>> By the way.\n\n00:23:13.204 --> 00:23:15.580\nWe turned it on,\nthen all of a sudden it killed everybody.\n\n00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.760\nWe don't know how that happened.\n\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.605\nIt just saw everybody as a threat and\nthen there was nobody left.\n\n00:23:19.605 --> 00:23:22.800\n[LAUGH] So all of a sudden,\nthe applications were there but\n\n00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.200\nnobody else was.\n\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.800\nCan you imagine if that was the way\nyou dealt with annoying users?\n\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.220\nHey, sit down at this keyboard,\nuse this application,\n\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.290\nand the minute you have a problem,\njust press this big red button.\n\n00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.124\nAnd then, a hand comes out and\nsmacks you in the forehead.\n\n00:23:33.124 --> 00:23:34.345\n>> A terminator will be by shortly.\n\n00:23:34.345 --> 00:23:36.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> Don't leave the building,\n\n00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.300\nwe're coming to get you.\n\n00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.550\nSo that's what RASP is.\n\n00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:42.310\nWe also wanna talk about vulnerability\nassessments and penetration testing.\n\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.200\nOldies but goodies in our security world.\n\n00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.480\nWe always are talking about these\nkinds of risk mitigation techniques.\n\n00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.260\nBut remember as we verify and validate,\nwe have to worry about vulnerabilities, so\n\n00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.920\nwe have to be on guard and\nlooking for them.\n\n00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.959\nSo we're gonna run vulnerability\nscanners hopefully.\n\n00:23:54.959 --> 00:23:58.262\nWe're gonna be looking at\nthe constant reconfiguration\n\n00:23:58.262 --> 00:24:02.128\nof the application because of\nsecurity patching from the vendor.\n\n00:24:02.128 --> 00:24:04.525\nSo we have to run vulnerability\nassessments to do that.\n\n00:24:04.525 --> 00:24:07.959\nWe also have to do penetration\ntesting to validate the architecture,\n\n00:24:07.959 --> 00:24:11.684\nvalidate the management, validate\nthe assumptions of the application and\n\n00:24:11.684 --> 00:24:15.310\nits runtime within the organization,\nwithin the network itself.\n\n00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:19.185\nSo we're gonna be going out and\ncollecting information at all stages and\n\n00:24:19.185 --> 00:24:23.545\nall areas of the system life cycle or\nthe software life cycle within the system\n\n00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:26.365\nto ensure that we understand how\nthat software is behaving and\n\n00:24:26.365 --> 00:24:30.573\nto try to manage risk down in\nthe organization as much as possible.\n\n00:24:30.573 --> 00:24:34.550\nWe also wanna pay attention to guidance\nthat may come to us from other areas and\n\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:34.585\nthird parties.\n\n00:24:34.585 --> 00:24:39.420\nI mentioned OWASP at the beginning\nof our little discussion here.\n\n00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.570\nIn this episode, and we've been\nout to the OWASP website before.\n\n00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:46.440\nI just was talking a couple minutes ago\nabout the OWASP top ten web application\n\n00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.859\nsecurity vulnerability list, something\nyou should be very familiar with in CCSP.\n\n00:24:49.859 --> 00:24:50.951\nWe're gonna go out and\n\n00:24:50.951 --> 00:24:54.450\ntake a slightly different\napproach to OWASP data this time.\n\n00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.885\nWe're gonna look at the web\napplication security project,\n\n00:24:56.885 --> 00:25:01.350\nbut we're gonna take a look specifically\nat the security testing recommendations.\n\n00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:04.757\nSo same area, but the testing guide as\nopposed to the top ten list this time.\n\n00:25:04.757 --> 00:25:08.497\nAnd I know that Daniel has on his\nscreen there the OWASP Testing Guide,\n\n00:25:08.497 --> 00:25:09.677\ncurrently version four.\n\n00:25:09.677 --> 00:25:13.437\nAgain, keep in mind that whenever you\ntake a look at this content at some\n\n00:25:13.437 --> 00:25:15.817\npoint in the future,\nthis may have been updated.\n\n00:25:15.817 --> 00:25:18.870\nWe always encourage you to go\nout to the website, look for\n\n00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:20.527\nthe latest version of\nwhatever this guide is.\n\n00:25:20.527 --> 00:25:24.167\nAnd just make sure you understand that,\nthat version would then be the one\n\n00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:27.180\nthat we would be referring to, even though\nthis may be a slightly earlier version.\n\n00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.670\nBased on when we shot this, if we perfect\ntime travel this would never be a problem,\n\n00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.610\nwe could always just go ahead and\n\n00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.520\nthen we could just simply insert\nthat new version right there.\n\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.360\n>> We'll have to talk to Doc Brown.\n\n00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.253\n>> We gotta figure that out,\ncuz you could see the next,\n\n00:25:39.253 --> 00:25:42.150\nlike the missing button to flash\nautomation that 'll be the missing piece.\n\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:44.540\nCuz we could do the flash animation,\nthe higher the time travel.\n\n00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.230\n>> That's right.\n\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.140\n>> Now, we're gonna simply drop them\nin and it you wouldn't even know.\n\n00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:50.500\n>> The content is always relevant\nbecause we just go back in time.\n\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.445\n>> It would be.\n\n00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:53.370\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Yeah, I mean.\n\n00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.170\nWe gotta get on that,\nas soon as we're done here, right?\n\n00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.350\n>> I'll put that on my\nlist of things to do.\n\n00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.560\n>> Yeah, forget about Hurricane Pizza.\n\n00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.370\nThat's the new thing, we gotta work on.\n\n00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:00.950\nThat's gonna be the project right there.\n\n00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.270\nSo, it's the [LAUGH] OWASP Testing Guide.\n\n00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.460\nWe're gonna have recommendations and\nguidance from OWASP with regards to how to\n\n00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.500\ndo web application testing and\nsecurity testing on web apps.\n\n00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.380\nCan we scroll down just a little bit,\n\n00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.870\nwe wanna take a look at\nthe active categories.\n\n00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.900\nThere are nine categories in there.\n\n00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.300\nSo as we go down, we're gonna take a look,\nyou're gonna have\n\n00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.460\nto find the overview because I can't see\nthe table of contents as you're scrolling.\n\n00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.770\nI'm gonna let you work on that for\na minute while we're talking,\n\n00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.350\nwe just kinda wanna essentially\nkinda what those are.\n\n00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.160\nYou will see them listed.\n\n00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.310\nSection by section.\n\n00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.500\nBut you may not actually be\nable to find them [INAUDIBLE].\n\n00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.840\nSo I'll give you moment to do that.\n\n00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.728\nLet's just talk about\nthe tested categories.\n\n00:26:36.728 --> 00:26:38.940\nJust while ago, we're looking for\nthem in the documents so\n\n00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.702\nwe can actually show them to you.\n\n00:26:40.702 --> 00:26:41.570\nWe're gonna look for\n\n00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:45.610\ninformation gathering, identity management\ntesting, authentication testing.\n\n00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.900\nThere's a whole bunch of them\nin there as testing categories.\n\n00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.200\nBut information gathering, for instance,\n\n00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:54.710\nis gonna be one of the categories we\nlook at, how are we getting information?\n\n00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:55.670\nI think it's in section four.\n\n00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:56.950\n>> I think it is section 4.\n\n00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:59.520\n>> That whole thing, If remember\ncorrectly is what we wanna see.\n\n00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.510\nSo we just wanna maybe click to\nthe head of that section and\n\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.950\njust jump to that page and\nthen we can kinda take a look from there,\n\n00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:07.245\nif it's like [CROSSTALK]\nthat's what we able to do.\n\n00:27:07.245 --> 00:27:10.521\n>> We want to just take a look at these\ncategories and understand them because,\n\n00:27:10.521 --> 00:27:11.810\nby the way, that's Daniel.\n\n00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.320\nYou did see him?\n\n00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.420\nThat's him in his earlier punk rock and\ngoth phase, without the makeup.\n\n00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:18.350\nThat's what he looks like\nwhen he's not on screen.\n\n00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.000\nAnd he's posing for the camera.\n\n00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.690\n>> My Cure cover band.\n\n00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:21.240\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:24.436\nOkay, so anyway.\n\n00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:28.190\nWe'll keep going, so\ninformation gathering,\n\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:32.310\nhow are we getting the requirements,\nhow are we getting the information?\n\n00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.880\nConfiguration deployment management\ntesting, how are we doing all that,\n\n00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.340\nwhat's that gonna look like?\n\n00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.000\nIdentity management testing, how do we\ndeal with identity in access management?\n\n00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.590\nHow do we do authentication testing?\n\n00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:46.543\nHow do we do authorization testing,\nsession management testing,\n\n00:27:46.543 --> 00:27:48.218\ninput validation testing?\n\n00:27:48.218 --> 00:27:51.950\nWe talked about this, testing for\nerror handling, very important.\n\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.675\nTesting for weak and strong cryptographic\nsolutions, business logic testing and\n\n00:27:56.675 --> 00:27:57.965\nclient side testing.\n\n00:27:57.965 --> 00:28:02.359\nThese are all the two, four, six,\neight, 11 categories overall that OWASP\n\n00:28:02.359 --> 00:28:05.850\nrecommends, so maybe we could zoom in for\njust a minute.\n\n00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:07.620\nAnd we will see that there's a list there.\n\n00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:09.430\nYou can see them all right there, perfect.\n\n00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:14.220\nAnd as a CSSP, you're gonna wanna\nknow this list of 11 items there.\n\n00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.700\nThere are a total of 11 subcategories,\nthe ones I labeled for you and called out.\n\n00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.400\nThere's a total of 91 controls, we can\nimplement in these various categories.\n\n00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.110\nSo some categories may have two controls.\n\n00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.430\nSome may have five.\n\n00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.300\nJust depends, but overall there's almost\na hundred controls we implement or\n\n00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:33.690\nat least are recommended to implement\nbased on the OWASP guidance here.\n\n00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:35.860\nBut as a CCSP if was you,\n\n00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:38.840\nI would wanna make sure I know\nwhat the 11 sub-categories are,\n\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.940\nthe bulletin IDC you see on the list,\nthe ones I just called out to you.\n\n00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.780\nThat OWASP in their testing\nguide recommends that we look at\n\n00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:50.390\nto do a complete span of verification\nvalidation across the application and\n\n00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.730\nacross the enterprise with regards to how\nwe access the data, how we manage it, and\n\n00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.590\nhow we interact with it.\n\n00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.400\nThese are all the different\nareas we'd want to drill into.\n\n00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.470\nSo this would be important\nto you to think through.\n\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.850\nAnd if you think about the logic\nof administer things on list for\n\n00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:03.540\ninstance, right.\n\n00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.809\nWe could take a look at configuration's\npoint of management testing for instance,\n\n00:29:07.809 --> 00:29:10.933\nso, the second bullet point,\nwe don't need to go to a per se,\n\n00:29:10.933 --> 00:29:13.590\njust gonna rattle off\nsome things to consider.\n\n00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.570\nIf you think about what we're doing there,\nright?\n\n00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.400\nWe are thinking about how we're going\nto create baselines, for instance, for\n\n00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.400\nthe application,\nwe want to document the configuration.\n\n00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.390\nWe want to use probably a CMDB,\n\n00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:26.353\na configuration management\ndatabase to do that.\n\n00:29:26.353 --> 00:29:28.210\nAnd we wanna have it a name as CIs,\n\n00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.280\nconfiguration items that are gonna be\nentries in the CMDB that we will then use\n\n00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.270\nto establish authoritatively,\nwhat the proper configuration, or\n\n00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:39.990\nconfigurations that may be allowed,\nfor the application will be.\n\n00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:43.690\nThink about the settings,\nthe implementation guidance,\n\n00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:45.765\nthe installation parameters, all that.\n\n00:29:45.765 --> 00:29:50.245\nAnd we wanna know what that is and then\nhave a record of that and document that.\n\n00:29:50.245 --> 00:29:53.495\nSo as we go to implement the application,\nwe can do so securely.\n\n00:29:53.495 --> 00:29:56.385\nIt's gonna be very important, so,\nyour one example of that there.\n\n00:29:56.385 --> 00:30:00.285\nAnd then the deployment side,\nis gonna be things like maybe using\n\n00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:03.965\na security baseline to configure\nthe application in such a way\n\n00:30:03.965 --> 00:30:07.845\nthat we understand how it should be\ndeployed and used in certain scenarios.\n\n00:30:07.845 --> 00:30:09.470\nAnd then have a record of that.\n\n00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:12.990\nAnd then continuously monitor that,\nso that we can remediate if we find\n\n00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:17.200\na deviation or delta from that\ndeployment model, whatever that may be.\n\n00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.380\nThese will be the kinds of controls,\n\n00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:23.680\nthe kinds of thought processes that we\nwill begin to detail out in this guide.\n\n00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.390\nAnd as we look across the 91\ncontrols in these 11 categories,\n\n00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.350\nwe see a lot of very\ngood thought processes.\n\n00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.550\nA lot of good very relevant\nbest practice recommendations.\n\n00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:39.350\nWe see all sorts of stuff here,\nthat's gonna help us to be more secure and\n\n00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:41.600\nbe ultimately less risk adverse.\n\n00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.545\nWe're gonna manage risk down in\nthe organization as a result.\n\n00:30:44.545 --> 00:30:48.123\nSo this is a very important\nreference document for all of us,\n\n00:30:48.123 --> 00:30:52.473\nas CCSPs to better understand how we\ncan apply industry best practices and\n\n00:30:52.473 --> 00:30:56.418\nsecure guidance and recommendations\nthat will make our systems.\n\n00:30:56.418 --> 00:31:00.560\nBut ultimately the software we allow to\nrun on the cloud, more secure as a result.\n\n00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.100\n>> Very cool document, that's for sure.\n\n00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.670\nOWASP tends to put out very interesting,\n\n00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.570\nvery helpful sets of guidelines and\npractices for us.\n\n00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.420\nAdam, is there anything else that\nwe need to cover when it comes to\n\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.810\ntrying to test our software\nto keep it secure,\n\n00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:17.290\nanything we need to know specifically,\nmaybe for the exam itself?\n\n00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.300\nWe would wanna just generically as\na thought process, maybe not so much for\n\n00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.120\nthe exam per se, but overall, and\ncertainly related to the thought\n\n00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.740\nprocess around preparing for the exam,\nwe always wanna understand the root cause.\n\n00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.830\nAnd we've talked a lot about root cause,\nroot cause analysis,\n\n00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:32.405\nwhy those things that knowledge can be\nimportant with regards to application\n\n00:31:32.405 --> 00:31:38.950\nsecurity testing we wanna try\nthrough SAS and DAS, and RASP.\n\n00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.735\nAnd looking at all the different\ncategories we've just talked about in\n\n00:31:41.735 --> 00:31:44.645\nthe OWASP area for\nknowledge of the application.\n\n00:31:44.645 --> 00:31:46.175\nIt's environment, it's dependencies,\n\n00:31:46.175 --> 00:31:48.105\nand all the things that\nare associated with it.\n\n00:31:48.105 --> 00:31:51.250\nWe always trying to understand\nthe broadest possible picture,\n\n00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.450\nthe broadest possible brush\nstrokes with regards to the risks.\n\n00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.640\nPicture that we paint in\nthe organization and don't forget to put\n\n00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.340\nroot cause analysis and the knowledge\nof root cause into that context.\n\n00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:05.180\nBecause that's really often the missing\npiece and if we can think all the time and\n\n00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:08.630\nlogically, about how we achieve\nroot cause awareness and\n\n00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.580\nhow we can understand root cause and the\nimportance that gives us, the framework it\n\n00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.730\ngives us and the understanding\nthe broad guidance it gives us.\n\n00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.430\nWith regards to the enterprise\narchitecture, right,\n\n00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.690\nthe enterprise security architecture,\nwe paint that picture but\n\n00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.660\nsometimes very narrowly defined.\n\n00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.800\nWe're talking about an application.\n\n00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.460\nLet's just test that one application.\n\n00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.890\nLet's make sure we know how that works.\n\n00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:30.300\nThat's important, but\n\n00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.880\nwhat about that application in\nthe broad context of the business?\n\n00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.200\nWhat is it gonna touch?\n\n00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:34.920\nWhat is it gonna interact with?\n\n00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.880\nWho's gonna use it under what conditions?\n\n00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.100\nWhat data will it produce?\n\n00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.490\nHow do we store that data securely?\n\n00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.640\nHow do we transmit that data securely?\n\n00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.120\nHow do we safeguard that\ndata over its life cycle?\n\n00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:47.270\nHow do we dispose of the data securely\nat the end of that life cycle.\n\n00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:52.370\nThese are the broader implications of\nthe enterprise security architecture.\n\n00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:56.620\nAnd root cause analysis helps us to really\nput that picture into perspective and\n\n00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:57.250\nunderstand it.\n\n00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.540\nSo if I could offer you\nany additional guidance,\n\n00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:01.740\nit would be to really always\nunderstand and remember.\n\n00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.150\nThe value of root cause and the value\nof the enterprise security architecture\n\n00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.340\nas the all up answers to questions\nthat put context on the table and\n\n00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.330\ncreate our ability to\nunderstand where we are,\n\n00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:14.220\nwith regards to that context throughout\nthe organization at all times.\n\n00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.300\n>> Well Adam we sure appreciate\nthat guidance and we appreciate.\n\n00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.450\nI'll give yourself that for watching but\nit looks like we've wrapped up yet\n\n00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:21.990\nanother episode here in ITProTV.\n\n00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.430\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:25.700\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.300\n>> I have not been then.\n\n00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:28.510\nOr who've I've been today?\n\n00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.320\nI have been a self-protecting application.\n\n00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.520\nThat's what I've been today.\n\n00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.580\n>> [LAUGH] And because of that,\nwe'll see you next time.\n\n00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:35.580\nHave a good one, everyone.\n\n00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.729\n>> Take care everybody.\n\nNOTE end of file",

ITProTV.\n\n00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:19.391\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\nin today's episode, that's right,\n\n00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:23.130\nwe are continuing with our Certified\nCloud Security Professional series.\n\n00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.500\nJoining us back in the studio again to\nlend his expertise on that very topic,\n\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.740\nour good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.960\nAdam, welcome back to the show and\nhow's it going?\n\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.130\n>> Good,\nI'm feeling a little blonde today.\n\n00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.130\n>> Feeling a little blonde?\n\n00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100\n>> I don't know.\nWe were having that whole conversation,\n\n00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.900\nmade me stop and think, boy.\n\n00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.745\n>> You would look good blonde I think.\n\n00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.500\n>> No.\n>> I say we do it.\n\n00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.985\n>> No, I would not.\n\n00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:40.835\nI'm looking forward to meeting your wife,\n\n00:00:40.835 --> 00:00:42.975\nI'm not looking forward to\nmeeting the dive model.\n\n00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:43.718\n>> She'll bring the bleach.\n\n00:00:43.718 --> 00:00:46.000\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm not looking forward to that.\n\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.325\nBut anyway, we're not here to\ntalk about hair color choices.\n\n00:00:49.325 --> 00:00:49.864\nWe are here to talk about\nenterprise operations and\n\n00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:50.409\nhow we're gonna ultimately implement and\nbuild.\n\n00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.350\nOr at least talk about how\nwe should implement and\n\n00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.500\nbuild physical infrastructure for\nthe cloud.\n\n00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.000\nFrom the CCSPs perspective,\n\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.590\nas we think about what we have to do to be\nsecure across the cloud infrastructure,\n\n00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.460\nacross the cloud enterprise, we have to\nmake sure that our thoughts, our concerns,\n\n00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.690\nthe concerns from a security\nstandpoint are voiced early\n\n00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.220\nin the process of building up to the cloud\nbefore we start actually using the cloud.\n\n00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.800\nSo we're really, at this point, focusing\non what are the data center issues and\n\n00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.720\nconcerns, we spoke about\nthose in our prior episode.\n\n00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.620\nWe're gonna take a look now at\nsome of the architecture elements,\n\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.870\nthe enterprise operation areas.\n\n00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.615\nWhat are best practices from setting\nup secure storage, how we multipath,\n\n00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:35.610\nhow we decide what we're gonna do and\nhow we're gonna do it.\n\n00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.170\nSo as we begin to think through what\nthe architecture will be we can insert\n\n00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.300\nsecure design elements along the way.\n\n00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.880\nTo make sure that as we do ultimately\nconsume in the cloud, we are able to do so\n\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.570\nin the most secure way possible.\n\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.950\n>> Adam would you say in the design,\n\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.500\nin the building phase, that we really\nwant to start with a security foundation\n\n00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.695\ninstead of trying to slap security on,\nafter we've built something?\n\n00:01:57.695 --> 00:02:00.115\n>> So it's always better,\nalways better to,\n\n00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:04.115\nif possible, to Daniel's point,\nto build security in from the beginning.\n\n00:02:04.115 --> 00:02:05.565\nWe talk about securing early and\n\n00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:08.495\nsecuring often when we talk\nabout security engineering.\n\n00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:12.410\nAnd the idea there is that if we're\nable to interdict in that development\n\n00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.773\ncycle early in the SDLC, in the actual\nrequirements gathering phase, before we\n\n00:02:16.773 --> 00:02:21.370\nactually even get to design, we can be\nright at the beginning of that process.\n\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.867\nAnd we can insert the security concerns\nand the security thought processes we need\n\n00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:30.837\nto have represented throughout design,\ndevelopment, testing, ultimately into\n\n00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:36.140\nsecure operations and the management of\nthe lifecycle out through secure disposal.\n\n00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.240\nWe can interdict at every one\nof those phases with security\n\n00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.470\ninstead of bolting it on after the fact.\n\n00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.164\nIt's always more effective,\nit's always more cost effective,\n\n00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.628\nit's always easier to implement,\nit's easier to manage.\n\n00:02:46.628 --> 00:02:51.900\nAnd it yields better results at the end of\nthe day because it's intuitively built in.\n\n00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.915\nAs opposed to being slapped together right\nand added on where it may not integrate\n\n00:02:55.915 --> 00:03:00.945\nproperly, may not be as cohesive and may\nnot be as far reaching an all consuming\n\n00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:04.635\nand all encompassing with it's support and\nultimately with its coverage, right?\n\n00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:08.251\nSo there's not doubt about it,\nit's a great point to make that we want\n\n00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:12.150\nto try to have security built in early and\nbuild in often if we can.\n\n00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.111\nFrom an enterprise operation standpoint,\nwe have to think about, and\n\n00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.160\nI've made this reference several times.\n\n00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.660\nWith regards to are we running private\ncloud on-prem versus outsourcing\n\n00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.240\ncloud essentially to a hosting model\nthrough a CSP, a cloud service provider.\n\n00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.755\nIf we're doing private on cloud,\nI keep saying private on cloud.\n\n00:03:31.755 --> 00:03:32.520\n>> You did.\n\n00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.470\n>> We should just rename that that.\n\n00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.790\n>> You're going to build that one day.\n\n00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.952\n>> We should just rename that, I just I\nthink I should be able to say that it's\n\n00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:40.808\nnow called private on cloud as\nopposed to private on-prem cloud.\n\n00:03:40.808 --> 00:03:42.991\nCuz for me, that would be so\nmuch easier, and\n\n00:03:42.991 --> 00:03:45.110\nit really is it's all about me after all.\n\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.888\nSo if it's going to be\nprivate on-prem cloud, right?\n\n00:03:48.888 --> 00:03:51.860\nAnd we're gonna own\nthe infrastructure ourselves,\n\n00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.940\nIT in the business is providing cloud for\nthe business.\n\n00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.000\nThat's what we essentially are describing.\n\n00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.990\nWhen we think about enterprise operations\nfrom this perspective, we have to stop and\n\n00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.540\nunderstand that everything we do, all the\nsecurity issues and concerns we address,\n\n00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.530\nall the policies, the procedures, all\nthe technology, is all gonna come from us.\n\n00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.650\nIt's gonna be internal, and we have to\ndecide how to deploy, how to manage,\n\n00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.440\nand ultimately how to allow for\nsecure consumption.\n\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.665\nIf we are doing this through\nsome sort of outsource model,\n\n00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:25.700\nwhere a third party cloud provider\nwho's gonna provide the infrastructure.\n\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.000\nAnd we're going to remotely manage and\nconsume across that infrastructure.\n\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.990\nWe have to partner to achieve\nthe enterprise operational security\n\n00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.170\nstandpoint that we need.\n\n00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.890\nWe have to in other words come up with\na way to jointly recognize our vision.\n\n00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.390\nAnd we have to work with\nthat cloud provider\n\n00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.100\nin order to make sure\nthat they can detail for\n\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.520\nus upfront what the expectations\nare from a security standpoint.\n\n00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.610\nWhat do they provide?\n\n00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.760\nWhat technology?\n\n00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.770\nWhat capabilities, under what\nconditions can we access the cloud?\n\n00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.610\nAnd with what expectation of control and\nwhat expectation of security?\n\n00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.900\nAnd then we have to allow that\ninformation to sink in and\n\n00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.760\nintegrate that into our planning and our\nmanagement and our documentation cycles.\n\n00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.540\nSo we should think about\nthe best practices,\n\n00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.350\ntraditionally of secure build, right?\n\n00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.180\nSecure initial config and\nultimately secure ongoing configuration.\n\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.900\nThe idea of security\nthat Daniel spoke about,\n\n00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.800\nbuilding in at every level, every layer.\n\n00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.540\nWhen we build out infrastructure for the\ncloud, envision what that looks like and\n\n00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.650\nbuild it securely.\n\n00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.400\nUse vendors that are on approved\nresource acquisition lists.\n\n00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.110\nUse authorized hardware that will run\non the platform, that's been tested.\n\n00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.524\nMaybe you go out and\nlook at the common criteria, ISO 15408.\n\n00:05:35.524 --> 00:05:38.600\nAnd maybe you decide you're gonna buy or\n\n00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.220\nacquire infrastructure that\nhas been certified and\n\n00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.740\nevaluated at a certain protection\nlevel under the common criteria.\n\n00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.810\nSo you want that EAL,\nthe Evaluation Assurance Level rating.\n\n00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.956\nOf EAL4, so you're gonna only buy\ninfrastructure at that level for\n\n00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:55.110\nyour cloud.\n\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.990\nThese are things, decisions,\nchoke points, right?\n\n00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.420\nIn the architecture of the build and\n\n00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.980\ndesign phases that as CCSP's we\nhave to be constantly aware of,\n\n00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.890\nconstantly monitoring, and\ndeciding how we should proceed forward.\n\n00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.257\nWhen we think about secure\ninitial configuration,\n\n00:06:10.257 --> 00:06:14.360\nwe gotta think about things like host\nhardening, host patching, host lockdown.\n\n00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.950\nThese are concepts that will be important\nfor us to implement and consider.\n\n00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.920\nStrip out all unnecessary services.\n\n00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.200\nEnsure that all necessary and required\npatches have not only been approved and\n\n00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.240\ntested, but have also been applied.\n\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.990\nMake sure that we are applying\nsecure templates and\n\n00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.370\nsecure baseline configurations to\nour host, and to our VMs by the way,\n\n00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.670\nour guest operating systems running\non them if we're virtualizing.\n\n00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.320\nAnd make sure that we use continuous\nmonitoring to not only initially\n\n00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.920\nconfigure, but then to monitor or to\nlook at that configuration over time and\n\n00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.130\nensure it is going to be\ncontinuously applied.\n\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.970\nIf it's not and we see a gap or a delta,\nsome deviation, that we are warned or\n\n00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.980\nalerted and we can then remediate.\n\n00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.810\nThese are all things that\nwe have to think about.\n\n00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.880\nOngoing configuration maintenance is about\nbaseline management and random sampling\n\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.820\nto ensure governance and compliance\nwith the proper security solutions.\n\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.560\nAll of these things would be important for\nthe CCSP to be thinking about.\n\n00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.950\nAnd as we've talked about in many other\nplaces in the episodes we've done,\n\n00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.400\nthis is not just unique to the cloud,\nright?\n\n00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.700\nThis is something that just is good\ncommon best practice, good common sense.\n\n00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.580\nYou would do it any\nkind of infrastructure,\n\n00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.500\nwhether it's cloud-based or not.\n\n00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.500\nYou should be up to date\non your patch management.\n\n00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.740\nYou should be doing\nconfiguration management,\n\n00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.960\nyou should be doing continuous monitoring.\n\n00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.650\nYou should be locking down your hosts,\nyou should be using approved hardware\n\n00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:37.200\nwith secure designs that are being\nimplemented and vetted, right?\n\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.940\nThis is all just common\nsense stuff you would do,\n\n00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.580\nwhether we're in the cloud or not.\n\n00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.140\nBut the point is that when we add\nthis thought process into the cloud,\n\n00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.700\nthe cloud can become as secure as\nall the other infrastructure we run,\n\n00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.990\nif we apply the same common sense\nmanagement perspectives and\n\n00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.640\nsecurity approaches to it.\n\n00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.354\nSo this is very important for\nus to think about.\n\n00:07:54.354 --> 00:07:57.937\nWhile we differentiate the cloud, and\nwe say, yes, it's a different environment.\n\n00:07:57.937 --> 00:07:59.652\nIt runs differently,\nit's managed differently.\n\n00:07:59.652 --> 00:08:01.974\nReality is, a lot of it is the same.\n\n00:08:01.974 --> 00:08:03.721\nBut I've made this point time and again.\n\n00:08:03.721 --> 00:08:06.437\nBut I want that point to continue for\nsomething, for\n\n00:08:06.437 --> 00:08:09.770\nyou to be able to hear that and\ncontinue to have that continue to be\n\n00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:14.340\nsomething that you are thinking about\nthroughout our conversations together and\n\n00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.521\nthroughout your time as you're not\nonly prepare to become a CCSP.\n\n00:08:17.521 --> 00:08:21.194\nBut ultimately, out beyond that as you\nare a CCSP at some point in the future and\n\n00:08:21.194 --> 00:08:23.490\nyou're actually doing\ncloud security worker.\n\n00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.880\nIf you're doing it already and\nyou continue to do it,\n\n00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.816\nyou have to bring that thought\nprocess to work with you everyday.\n\n00:08:28.816 --> 00:08:33.459\nWhat am I gonna do to secure the cloud\nis the question the CCSP asks.\n\n00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:38.501\nBut the reality or the real take on\nthat question is not what am I gonna do\n\n00:08:38.501 --> 00:08:44.570\nthat is necessarily cloud specific, but\nwhat am I gonna do that is generic and\n\n00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:47.237\nthat has to be tuned, applied, modified.\n\n00:08:47.237 --> 00:08:50.863\nAnd essentially, somehow constrained or\nconstricted to apply\n\n00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:55.930\nto the cloud if that's the unique\nenvironment variable I have to address,\n\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:57.594\nbut patch management is patch management.\n\n00:08:57.594 --> 00:08:59.449\nLog management is log management.\n\n00:08:59.449 --> 00:09:00.909\nUsing configuration management,\n\n00:09:00.909 --> 00:09:03.800\nit's the same whether you\ndo it in the cloud or not.\n\n00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.700\nSo, don't avoid those\ncommon sense solutions.\n\n00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.588\nDon't avoid the things we know\nare going to be impactful, useful and\n\n00:09:09.588 --> 00:09:12.453\nvaluable in the toolkit of\nthe security professional.\n\n00:09:12.453 --> 00:09:15.431\nMake sure you embrace them,\nbring them into the cloud, but\n\n00:09:15.431 --> 00:09:18.948\nthen add the cloud's specific flavors\nnecessary to ensure success in\n\n00:09:18.948 --> 00:09:22.423\nthe unique environments that we\nfind ourselves in within the cloud.\n\n00:09:22.423 --> 00:09:25.813\n>> Adam,\nwould you say that it's getting easier for\n\n00:09:25.813 --> 00:09:30.900\nus to be more security minded and\nimplement secure features,\n\n00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.252\nsecure hardware and design, because we\nare living, in which it seems to me,\n\n00:09:35.252 --> 00:09:38.993\na secure centric or\nsecurely idealized environment.\n\n00:09:38.993 --> 00:09:41.705\nEverything nowadays,\nyou get a laptop nowadays,\n\n00:09:41.705 --> 00:09:44.739\nit's more likely you are getting\none without a TPM in it.\n\n00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:47.529\nIt's unlikely that there's\nnot going to be secure or\n\n00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:50.629\nsecurity design elements inside\nof software that you buy,\n\n00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:54.422\nthey're gonna have patch management\nthat you will be able to update it.\n\n00:09:54.422 --> 00:09:59.222\nIs that making our job easier or are we\nstill seeing the fact that these things\n\n00:09:59.222 --> 00:10:04.370\nare not happening or you're still bound\nto run across very insecure items?\n\n00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.810\n>> Sure.\nSo its a great question from a couple of\n\n00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.390\nperspectives, cuz we're\nreally thinking about ooh,\n\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.760\nI don't wanna quite call\nit nurture versus nature.\n\n00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.778\nThis age old argument about whether we\nlearn to do certain things or whether\n\n00:10:17.778 --> 00:10:22.321\nwe're natively, naturally born to them and\nthey're part of our DNA essentially.\n\n00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.592\nThey're intuitive and they're there\njust because they're just part of being\n\n00:10:25.592 --> 00:10:27.670\na human, regardless of what we do.\n\n00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.902\nI don't think it's quite that.\n\n00:10:27.902 --> 00:10:30.810\nBecause clearly,\nwe know there's insecure behavior and\n\n00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.208\ninsecurity all around us despite\nour best efforts to the contrary.\n\n00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:37.896\nI think it's an interesting analogy, if we\nlook at it from the perspective of maybe\n\n00:10:37.896 --> 00:10:40.440\nfrom technology and\nthe emerge of technology over time.\n\n00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:44.320\nSo, you use the example of what we're\nbuilding all this stuff in today.\n\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.477\nSo let's think about the automotive\nindustry for a minute and\n\n00:10:47.477 --> 00:10:51.590\nthink about the fact that when,\nlet's say, probably back roughly,\n\n00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.748\nI'm guessing in the 1960s, maybe 1970s.\n\n00:10:53.748 --> 00:10:56.490\nI don't know exactly when this occurred,\nbut\n\n00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:59.600\nthe advent maybe even earlier,\nmaybe back in the 50s or early 60s.\n\n00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.256\nThe advent of seatbelts and\n\n00:11:01.256 --> 00:11:05.944\nseatbelts become something that are put\ninto cars at a certain point in time.\n\n00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:08.104\nWay before airbags,\nway before anti-lock brakes,\n\n00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:09.546\nway before all of this other stuff.\n\n00:11:09.546 --> 00:11:13.446\nWe have today that's continued\nthe march of life safety and\n\n00:11:13.446 --> 00:11:18.360\nthe ability to secure the occupants of\na vehicle despite their best efforts\n\n00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.860\nto the contrary, to act insecurely.\n\n00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.800\nAnd so when we think about what we see or\nwe think about seeing the admin of\n\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.643\nseatbelts and the fact that for a long\ntime, we knew from anecdotal evidence and\n\n00:11:29.643 --> 00:11:32.500\nfrom research that\nseatbelts would save lives.\n\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.720\nSo I mean, there's no doubt about it.\n\n00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.815\nI don't think anybody would argue with\nthe fact that if you put a seatbelt on and\n\n00:11:37.815 --> 00:11:42.159\nyou're driving down the road in a car, you\nare much more likely to survive a crash if\n\n00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:44.910\nyou're wearing that seatbelt\nthen if you're not.\n\n00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.210\nI mean,\nthere's really no way to argue that and\n\n00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.791\nnot accept that these days is just\nsomething we intuitively understand.\n\n00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:51.686\nIt's a fact.\n\n00:11:51.686 --> 00:11:55.949\nAnd so when seatbelts first came out,\nmost people did not use them.\n\n00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:57.319\nAnd even today, I mean,\n\n00:11:57.319 --> 00:12:01.647\nI still am shocked by the fact that I see\npeople driving not wearing seatbelts.\n\n00:12:01.647 --> 00:12:07.577\nSo because we build security and when we\nbuild life safety technology into cars,\n\n00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:11.850\ndoes it necessarily mean that\npeople act anymore secure or\n\n00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:13.870\nact anymore risk adverse.\n\n00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:16.492\nWe haven't really changed\ntheir behavior is the problem.\n\n00:12:16.492 --> 00:12:20.176\nWhat we've done is we've built\ncompensating control mechanisms,\n\n00:12:20.176 --> 00:12:24.177\nanti-lock breaks, anti-collision\ntechnology, lane monitoring, so\n\n00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:27.685\nthat you don't pull out for\nblind spots or whatever they call it.\n\n00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:30.466\nSo you don't pull out and\nbasically run right into somebody,\n\n00:12:30.466 --> 00:12:33.460\ncuz you don't see them on\nthe left-hand side of the car.\n\n00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.170\nBecause your massively long,\n\n00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:40.733\naircraft carrier-sized SUV has several\nblind spots in it or whatever it may be.\n\n00:12:40.733 --> 00:12:42.330\nSo I'm not bitter, by the way.\n\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.253\nI sound that way, but really I'm not.\n\n00:12:43.253 --> 00:12:44.959\nI'm actually really-\n>> He's a very pleasant man.\n\n00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:46.840\n>> I'm a very pleasant\nindividual normally.\n\n00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.100\nI just come across being incredibly\nbitter about certain things, but\n\n00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.200\nthat's just the way life is.\n\n00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:55.652\nBut if you think about the logic of this,\nI think it's kind of hopefully,\n\n00:12:55.652 --> 00:12:57.946\na parallel that makes\na lot of sense to people.\n\n00:12:57.946 --> 00:13:02.419\nWhat we've done over time is we've\ncontinued to build compensating controls\n\n00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:06.688\nthat offset the same kind of risky\nbehavior that people are intuitively and\n\n00:13:06.688 --> 00:13:08.397\njust naturally engaging in.\n\n00:13:08.397 --> 00:13:13.583\nBecause we have not found a way to\nactually get them to stop being or\n\n00:13:13.583 --> 00:13:18.676\nacting in a way that allows them to,\nessentially put themselves\n\n00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:22.850\nin harms way when they will\noperate a motor vehicle.\n\n00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.891\nAnd as a result of that, we have to\ncontinually innovate to your point.\n\n00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:29.193\nTo build better systems to take more and\nmore of that burden and\n\n00:13:29.193 --> 00:13:32.510\nthat responsibility away\nfrom the human operator and\n\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.923\nautomate the process of saving them,\nessentially.\n\n00:13:34.923 --> 00:13:36.867\nSo, we have automatic airbags that deploy.\n\n00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:39.453\nWe have anti collision systems and\nthings of this nature.\n\n00:13:39.453 --> 00:13:42.100\nYou remember,\nwhat was the name of the movie?\n\n00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.270\nWesley Snipes and\nSylvester Stallone are in it\n\n00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.909\n>> Demolition Man\n\n00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:46.583\n>> Demolition Man.\n\n00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:49.330\nSo if you remember, I'm in Demolition Man.\n\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.263\n>> It's one of Don's favorite movies,\nby the way.\n\n00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.285\n>> Is it?\n>> Yes, he loves it.\n\n00:13:51.285 --> 00:13:52.748\n>> It's an awesome movie,\nit's an awesome movie.\n\n00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:57.904\nThe positioning of Taco Bell as the world\nmanufacturing of food, it's unbelievable.\n\n00:13:57.904 --> 00:14:00.943\nBut aside from all that, the fact\nthat Taco Bell takes over the world.\n\n00:14:00.943 --> 00:14:06.450\nThat in and of itself was kinda cool,\nbut if you remember in that\n\n00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:11.151\nmovie at a certain point\nSylvester Stallone's riding along in\n\n00:14:11.151 --> 00:14:16.180\none of the cars and\nthere is a collision or something happens.\n\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.340\nAnd instead of just the air bag,\n\n00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.200\nit's essentially like a foam\nsubstance of some kind.\n\n00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:27.600\nIt envelopes him in the entire frame of\nthe car and essentially the crash happens,\n\n00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:27.736\nwhatever.\n\n00:14:27.736 --> 00:14:31.455\nEverything stops, he gets out and\nit's like he's breaking out of an egg,\n\n00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:32.708\nbut he's totally safe.\n\n00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:35.338\nBecause essentially,\nhe went nowhere in the crash,\n\n00:14:35.338 --> 00:14:37.390\nbecause the foam just froze him in space.\n\n00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.252\nSo we think about these kinda things and\nwe think about the fact that yes,\n\n00:14:41.252 --> 00:14:45.321\ndespite everybody's best activities\nat best attempts at being insecure.\n\n00:14:45.321 --> 00:14:47.750\nWe're gonna take every\nopportunity away from them.\n\n00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:48.572\nIt's kinda like that.\n\n00:14:48.572 --> 00:14:52.487\nI think that, ultimately, while we\ncontinue to build more secure system,\n\n00:14:52.487 --> 00:14:55.250\nwe continue to build more\nsecurity into our systems.\n\n00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.200\nThe use of TPMs for instance,\nTrusted Platform Modules.\n\n00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.239\nThe use of more secure protocols.\n\n00:15:01.239 --> 00:15:04.500\nThe use of higher level\nencryption algorithms.\n\n00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.570\nThe ability to apply those things through\nvery simple point and click environments.\n\n00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.369\nA very minimal graphical UI interaction,\nso the user could really,\n\n00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:17.440\nvery simply, almost with one button,\nautomate and secure everything.\n\n00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.700\nEven despite those efforts, we still see\nhuge amounts of insecure behavior and\n\n00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.371\nhuge amounts of potential\nliability with regards\n\n00:15:24.371 --> 00:15:26.929\nto breach opportunities\noccurring every day.\n\n00:15:26.929 --> 00:15:32.390\nSo, I don't think that it's the technology\nthat makes us more or less secure.\n\n00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.326\nI think it's our ability to focus on\nultimately training and awareness and\n\n00:15:35.326 --> 00:15:36.745\nchanging people's behavior.\n\n00:15:36.745 --> 00:15:38.852\nThat is the gradient that\nwe have to move through and\n\n00:15:38.852 --> 00:15:40.568\nultimately figure out on the Bell curve.\n\n00:15:40.568 --> 00:15:44.429\nHow we're gonna move that indicator,\nbecause if we're sitting,\n\n00:15:44.429 --> 00:15:47.488\nroughly if this is the top\nof the bell curve like this.\n\n00:15:47.488 --> 00:15:51.749\nWe're sitting on this slope over here and\nwe're seeing a lot of people that may or\n\n00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:54.500\nmay not pay attention, but at the low end,\n\n00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:56.842\nwe're probably seeing people\nthat are very secure.\n\n00:15:56.842 --> 00:15:59.671\nAt the other low end, we're seeing\npeople that are incredible unsecure.\n\n00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:02.443\nAnd in the middle, we see the gradient\nof people that are somewhat secure,\n\n00:16:02.443 --> 00:16:03.289\nsomewhat not secure.\n\n00:16:03.289 --> 00:16:06.993\nI think we're at the point now where we're\nseeing a lot of people that continue\n\n00:16:06.993 --> 00:16:08.236\nto be somewhat insecure.\n\n00:16:08.236 --> 00:16:12.860\nBecause they just don't really think that\nthey own the liability, right, ultimately.\n\n00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:15.810\nWe make it clear to them, if you act\ninsecurely, we'll fix the problem.\n\n00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.210\nDon't worry about it.\n\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.230\nIT will respond.\n\n00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.890\nSo, what do they do?\n\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.810\nThey go off and\nthey act insecurely because IT responds.\n\n00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:22.950\nSo when we think about that,\n\n00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.630\nwe really have to think about what's\nthe message we're sending to those users.\n\n00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.420\nAnd ultimately, how are we\nencouraging them to act securely,\n\n00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.490\nas opposed to encouraging them or\nallowing them to act insecurely,\n\n00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.760\ncuz we'll build safety mechanisms\nthat will offset that.\n\n00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.200\n>> It kinda goes back to your car analogy,\nright?\n\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.856\nWe've built in airbags and\ncollision detection, and people go,\n\n00:16:39.856 --> 00:16:42.990\nI got airbags, I got collision detection,\nI'll just drive like a maniac and\n\n00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.730\nif I get in trouble, well,\nthe car will save me, in essence.\n\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.664\nAnd so, and\nmaybe it even makes driving worse.\n\n00:16:48.664 --> 00:16:50.404\nSo, I guess that goes back to that.\n\n00:16:50.404 --> 00:16:51.286\n>> Well, we know cell phones.\n\n00:16:51.286 --> 00:16:52.463\nIt can definitely make driving worse.\n\n00:16:52.463 --> 00:16:54.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We know that for a fact, right.\n\n00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.225\nSo the fact that we allow people to\noperate consumer electronics while\n\n00:16:57.225 --> 00:16:59.345\ndriving, is definitely an issue, right.\n\n00:16:59.345 --> 00:17:02.625\nAnd all kidding aside, being very\nserious about this, we know right, that\n\n00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:06.858\nthe rates an incidence of crash related\nactivities, because of driver distraction\n\n00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:10.620\njust continue to be a huge problem both in\nthe United States and around the world.\n\n00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.620\nIt's not just here, right?\n\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.320\nSo we know that those kind of things\nmaybe unforseen and unlooked for and\n\n00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.442\nI don't think anybody did it on purpose,\nright.\n\n00:17:16.442 --> 00:17:20.192\nBut at the end of the day, the fact that\nwe allow this behavior to occur, and\n\n00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:23.762\nwe build compensating and\noffsetting controls to indeed, in effect,\n\n00:17:23.762 --> 00:17:27.540\nencourage it in some respects\nis incredibly problematic.\n\n00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:31.240\nAnd I think we see that behavior extending\nitself into all areas including things\n\n00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.170\nlike the cloud.\n\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.990\nWe spend a lot of time in shows like this\nand in certifications like this right,\n\n00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.480\nteaching you how to make sure that no\nmatter what your users do, no matter\n\n00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.900\nthe bad choices they make, you're gonna\nhave a mechanism in place to offset that.\n\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.620\nYou're gonna build defense in depth.\n\n00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.100\nYou're gonna anticipate\ntheir ill activities and\n\n00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.300\ntheir ill will and then you're gonna\ndo your best to compensate for it and\n\n00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:53.160\nproactively, hopefully,\nbe there to defend against it.\n\n00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.910\nI mean that's the message.\n\n00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.944\nIf you think about the message,\nthe messages yeah,\n\n00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:57.377\nlet's not worry about stopping it,\n\n00:17:57.377 --> 00:18:00.216\nlet's worry about figuring out how\nto make sure we're prepared for it.\n\n00:18:00.216 --> 00:18:04.216\nAnd I think that's just how culturally\nhow we find ourselves, and as a result,\n\n00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:06.559\nyou get what you essentially create,\nright?\n\n00:18:06.559 --> 00:18:07.230\n>> That's true.\n\n00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:07.957\n>> That's what we're doing.\n\n00:18:07.957 --> 00:18:09.150\nThat's what we're reinforcing.\n\n00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.830\nAt least that's my take on it, anyway.\n\n00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.360\nThis has been CounterPoint with Adam and\nDaniel.\n\n00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.860\nThank you very much.\n\n00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.410\nWe're not done, don't go away.\n\n00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.780\nSo let's get back to what we were\nhere to actually talk about,\n\n00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.870\nwhich is things that we are dealing\nwith in the physical environment, right.\n\n00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.700\nInstitutional configuration of the data\ncenter and the infrastructure,\n\n00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.860\nwhat are we building and\nhow are we going to build it securely, and\n\n00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:32.810\nthen how are we going to encourage users\nto be insecure by using it, right?\n\n00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.146\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, things like storage controllers,\n\n00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:37.155\nwe have to worry about how we're going\nto architect storage management and\n\n00:18:37.155 --> 00:18:38.250\nstorage pathways.\n\n00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.971\nWe have ISCSI.\n\n00:18:39.971 --> 00:18:42.530\nWe have Fiber Channel,\nFiber Channel over Ethernet.\n\n00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:44.950\nThese are our choices for\nstorage in the cloud.\n\n00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:49.700\nWe should understand the pros and cons\nof using each kind of storage mechanism,\n\n00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:51.610\nregardless of the storage\nprotocol being used.\n\n00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:53.910\nAnd these are all storage\nprotocols by the way.\n\n00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:57.920\nThe storage controllers, the mechanisms\nthat access the storage pathway and\n\n00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.890\nnetwork, have to be secured.\n\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.710\nWe have to set them up and\ndeploy them with vendor guidance.\n\n00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.380\nWe have to make sure we're smart\nabout what we do and how we do it.\n\n00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:10.226\nDo you know the difference by the way, Mr.\nDaniel, between SCSI and iSCSI?\n\n00:19:10.226 --> 00:19:13.280\n>> Well,\nI would assume that's one since it's Is.\n\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.376\n>> Never assume by the way.\n\n00:19:14.376 --> 00:19:15.985\n>> [LAUGH] I hypothesize [LAUGH].\n\n00:19:15.985 --> 00:19:18.562\n>> It makes me feel really bad\nwhen you assume, so never assume.\n\n00:19:18.562 --> 00:19:21.925\n>> But because well, iSCSI is basically\ntaking that SCSI information and\n\n00:19:21.925 --> 00:19:23.560\nit's channeling over Ethernet.\n\n00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:28.661\n>> Yes but yes, so essentially over\nEthernet, we describe it as Internet,\n\n00:19:28.661 --> 00:19:31.496\nover the Internet, but\nessentially right, same thing.\n\n00:19:31.496 --> 00:19:35.977\nWe're taking SCSI which is an interior,\ninside a single machine storage\n\n00:19:35.977 --> 00:19:40.962\nmechanism right, local hard drive, SCSI\ncontroller probably a SCSI card of some\n\n00:19:40.962 --> 00:19:45.708\nkind with SCSI cabling, right,\nin the old world way of doing things.\n\n00:19:45.708 --> 00:19:47.490\nAnd then, you would have that but\n\n00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:50.410\nit was just a local communication\npath inside a single machine.\n\n00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.833\nWe are Lan Enabling SCSI when we do iSCSI,\nwe're taking it out across the wire,\n\n00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:57.935\nacross the ethernet and\nor across the Internet.\n\n00:19:57.935 --> 00:20:02.155\nI for Internet, small i, and\nessentially we're taking SCSI on the road,\n\n00:20:02.155 --> 00:20:06.250\nthat's how we often think, or at least\nthat's how I think about it anyway.\n\n00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.205\nSo we have a SCSI food truck, and\nwe're driving it around everywhere,\n\n00:20:09.205 --> 00:20:12.705\nserving hurricane pizzas and\nall sorts of other fancy stuff.\n\n00:20:12.705 --> 00:20:15.290\nThat's all of the people\nthat want storage but\n\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.630\nwe're essentially network enabling SCSI,\nright?\n\n00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.970\nThat's really what iSCSI is.\n\n00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.808\nAnd you're absolutely right\nto think about it that way.\n\n00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:25.751\nSo we wanna understand that iSCSI is\na protocol that is used to provide access\n\n00:20:25.751 --> 00:20:29.631\nto SCSI based storage mechanisms\nover a LAN or a WAN or both.\n\n00:20:29.631 --> 00:20:33.517\nAnd we're using the TCP protocol, right,\nto be able to transmit SCSI commands\n\n00:20:33.517 --> 00:20:37.346\nenabling them for use essentially on\na storage network, probably with a SAN,\n\n00:20:37.346 --> 00:20:41.600\na storage area network most likely,\nand that's what we're doing.\n\n00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.570\nWhen we think about these networks,\n\n00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.205\nwe talk about what are called\nthe initiator and targets.\n\n00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:50.750\nInitiators, in the language of storage,\nare commonly referred to as HBAs,\n\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.149\nhost bus adapters.\n\n00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.700\nThe HBA is the storage processor, or\n\n00:20:56.700 --> 00:21:02.100\nthe network access point for\nstorage that sits on the host.\n\n00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.590\nThat sits on the place where you\nare trying to access storage from,\n\n00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.300\nnot where the storage is, but rather\nwhere you are as the end point consumer.\n\n00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.880\nAnd that's the network end,\n\n00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:15.170\nthe business end of network connectivity,\nout to the storage network.\n\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.790\nWe call that an initiator.\n\n00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:19.300\nIt's commonly referred to as an HBA.\n\n00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.700\nI used the term storage\nprocessor just a minute ago.\n\n00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.994\nStorage processor is the common name we\nuse for a target, which is the far end\n\n00:21:25.994 --> 00:21:30.624\nof that network connection, where you are\ngonna go get storage from on the storage\n\n00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:34.138\nnetwork, typically,\nthe front end of the SAN or NAS device.\n\n00:21:34.138 --> 00:21:36.442\nAnd the network connection\non that device or\n\n00:21:36.442 --> 00:21:40.390\non that network is considered\nthe target or the storage processor.\n\n00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.370\nSo you wanna make sure you\nunderstand the language.\n\n00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.595\nInitiators are the network connection,\nnetwork endpoint, where we,\n\n00:21:46.595 --> 00:21:50.625\nas the consumer of storage, are gonna\nuse to connect to our storage network.\n\n00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:54.705\nAnd then a target is the business\nend of storage on the arrays side,\n\n00:21:54.705 --> 00:21:57.695\nit's the network connection on the NAS,\nthe Network Attached Storage, or\n\n00:21:57.695 --> 00:21:59.355\non the SAN, Storage Area Network device.\n\n00:21:59.355 --> 00:22:02.165\nSo make sure we understand\nthe difference between the two.\n\n00:22:02.165 --> 00:22:05.435\nWe tend to talk about\ntargets representing LUNs.\n\n00:22:05.435 --> 00:22:10.282\nLUNs, Logical Unit Numbers, are gonna\nbe the logical way we carve up physical\n\n00:22:10.282 --> 00:22:15.204\nstorage on a SAN, and how we actually\nrepresent that physical storage so that it\n\n00:22:15.204 --> 00:22:20.296\ncould be consumed through a virtual\nenvironment, or consumed from an endpoint.\n\n00:22:20.296 --> 00:22:24.860\nAnd we can then have access to it\nexclusively to use that storage for\n\n00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:24.990\nour needs.\n\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:29.851\nThis is how we, as a storage provider,\na cloud service provider that's providing\n\n00:22:29.851 --> 00:22:33.878\nstorage are gonna present storage,\nor is going to present storage,\n\n00:22:33.878 --> 00:22:37.840\nto a single-tenant in\na multi-tenant environment.\n\n00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.940\nAnd how we're gonna zone and mask that\nstorage to make it available only to you.\n\n00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:44.290\nSo if I'm gonna give Daniel,\nlet's say here,\n\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:49.500\n64 TB of storage from my\n50 PB storage array, right?\n\n00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.420\nI'm gonna carve that off,\nI'm gonna give Daniel one or more LUNs,\n\n00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.390\ncuz I could do this in several ways,\nbut in theory it could be one LUN,\n\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.771\nit could be several LUNs,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n00:22:57.771 --> 00:22:58.580\nLet's keep it simple.\n\n00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:03.489\nI'm gonna give him one LUN that\nlogically represents 64 TB of physical\n\n00:23:03.489 --> 00:23:08.800\nstorage on one or more of the drives\non the back end on that systems.\n\n00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.552\nMost likely it'll be more than one\ndrive and we'll just carve all that up,\n\n00:23:11.552 --> 00:23:14.918\nallocate it out, format it, and\nthen put Daniel's name on it.\n\n00:23:14.918 --> 00:23:19.790\nAnd that LUN designation represents\na connectivity access point,\n\n00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:22.480\na pathway and a unique identifier\n\n00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.640\nthat tells Daniel how to get to\nthe storage I've allocated for him.\n\n00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.450\nThe target represents the doorway we\nwalk through to get to Daniel's LUN\n\n00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.860\non the device side.\n\n00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.572\nAnd the initiator is the door we\nwalk through from the host side,\n\n00:23:35.572 --> 00:23:38.758\nwhere Daniel's actually\ngonna be able to be sitting.\n\n00:23:38.758 --> 00:23:43.147\nAnd Daniel's connection to the storage\npathway is through the initiator and\n\n00:23:43.147 --> 00:23:46.630\nthen his end point is the target and\nthen he consumes his LUN.\n\n00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.280\nSo we want to make sure we\nunderstand the language of storage.\n\n00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.401\nVery, very important.\n\n00:23:50.401 --> 00:23:52.279\nSounds like follow the yellow\nbrick road analogy this week.\n\n00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:55.112\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're talking through that, right?\n\n00:23:55.112 --> 00:23:56.659\nSo 64 TB, that's a lot of storage, right?\n\n00:23:56.659 --> 00:23:57.228\n>> That's a lot.\n\n00:23:57.228 --> 00:23:58.114\nYeah, that's a good amount.\n\n00:23:58.114 --> 00:24:00.660\n>> You could download a lot of movies or\na lot of software with all that or\n\n00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:01.474\nsomething, right.\n\n00:24:01.474 --> 00:24:02.304\nYou could have a lot of stuff.\n\n00:24:02.304 --> 00:24:04.681\nAll right, so we also have to\nthink about over-subscription.\n\n00:24:04.681 --> 00:24:09.890\nRight, if I give Daniel 64 terabytes\nof storage, but he says, Adam,\n\n00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:10.408\nI need more, right?\n\n00:24:10.408 --> 00:24:13.779\nAnd he's gonna want more storage\ncuz he's got more stuff to do,\n\n00:24:13.779 --> 00:24:15.360\nhe may over subscribe.\n\n00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.600\nHe may over consume.\n\n00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.370\nHe may try to use more than\nis actually available.\n\n00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:23.730\nNot that Daniel would do that,\ncuz he's a very low level moderate, very,\n\n00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:24.910\nvery middle of the road kind of guy.\n\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.710\nBut we know people that\ncould potentially do that.\n\n00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.220\nSo we want to make sure like Don and Mike.\n\n00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.760\n>> Don [CROSSTALK].\nDon takes his piece of the pie.\n\n00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:33.480\n>> And then some.\n\n00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.110\n>> And then some, yeah.\n\n00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:36.700\n>> And then some if you're\nnot paying attention, right?\n\n00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.660\n>> Like a fork in the back of your hand.\n\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.300\n>> [LAUGH] It's my pie.\n\n00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.190\nGet away from that, right?\n\n00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.620\nSo we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that over subscription or\n\n00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.680\nover consumption is a bad thing right?\n\n00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.100\nFrom a security stand point if\nI promise you five things and\n\n00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.910\nyou tell me you're gonna take seven.\n\n00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.230\nYou're taking them from somebody else.\n\n00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:54.510\nWe wanna make sure we don't\nallow that to happen.\n\n00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.250\nSo over subscription is a problem.\n\n00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:59.630\nWe need to make sure on the storage side\nin particular that we're monitoring for\n\n00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:03.000\nthis because over consumption,\nover subscription of the data source,\n\n00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.970\ncan lead to system failure and\nthe Cloud can essentially crash right.\n\n00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.352\nSo we don't want that to happen.\n\n00:25:08.352 --> 00:25:11.680\nBecause if we have too many virtual\nmachines drawing storage down\n\n00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.990\nsimultaneously and over consuming.\n\n00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:17.910\nWe may run out of space and if we run out\nof space essentially a virtual machine is\n\n00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.450\nnothing more than a bunch of files that\nare connected together with a common\n\n00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:24.680\nmanagement interface and\nare running across the network.\n\n00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.859\nIf we run out of space and those\nfiles can't grow or can't operate and\n\n00:25:28.859 --> 00:25:33.397\nturn on we can't create swap files and\nlog files and all the stuff we got to do\n\n00:25:33.397 --> 00:25:37.890\non that storage network to be able\nto ultimately on the LAN run the VM.\n\n00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.930\nThe VM stops working and\nif they stop working you're done right.\n\n00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.280\nThe cloud's there but\nyou're not doing anything in it.\n\n00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.620\nBecause you can't consume.\n\n00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.889\nSo understand that, so\nwe think about things like\n\n00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.930\nmaking sure that we dedicate networks\nspecifically to storage traffic.\n\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:55.520\nWe want to give you dedicated bandwidths\nthat you're not over subscribin, over\n\n00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:00.930\nconsuming, jointly held bandwidth networks\nwhere we want management, live migration v\n\n00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:06.170\nmotion, fault tolerance, logging and\nvirtual sand traffic and all that stuff.\n\n00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.640\nWe want all that there, we want to\ndifferentiate all that out right.\n\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.270\nAnd so we wanna dedicate\nnetworks to storage consumption,\n\n00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:15.290\nbecause this is one of the places\nwhere over subscription can kill us.\n\n00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:19.200\nWe wanna make sure that we don't share\nthose networks from a security standpoint,\n\n00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:23.420\nso that way customer X has their own\nnetwork, customer Y has their own network,\n\n00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:26.740\nand everybody is essentially happy and\nisolated on their own.\n\n00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.280\nRemember, we want that virtualized\nenvironment to be sandboxed, right,\n\n00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:33.960\nto be running on its own with no\nvisibility from the other sandboxes.\n\n00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.340\nWe want little islands that\nreally can't see each other.\n\n00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.460\nAnd we don't wanna oversubscribe that.\n\n00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.970\nWe don't wanna use more bandwidth or\nmore storage or\n\n00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.560\nmore resource capacity whatever\nit is than is available to us.\n\n00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:50.790\nIt's the job of the CCSP to ensure that we\nhave policies that help us to manage and\n\n00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.890\nset this up.\n\n00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.680\nBut remember we may not be implementing\nand managing the virtualization and\n\n00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.680\nthe cloud-based technologies ourselves.\n\n00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.170\nA cloud service provider\nmay on our behalf.\n\n00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:02.780\nWe may have dedicated administrators,\npeople like Daniel,\n\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.750\nlike myself that may actually do this for\na living.\n\n00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:10.320\nThat actually specialize right in setting\nup and running virtualized environments.\n\n00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.280\nBut they may not be the same\npeople that are the CSPs,\n\n00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.750\nthe cloud security professionals.\n\n00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.900\nSo you may again be partnering with them.\n\n00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.500\nAnd you need to understand that.\n\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.160\nWhen we talk about over subscription,\n\n00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.580\nthis is something that typically an IT\nadmin function would be monitoring for.\n\n00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.000\nNot a security function.\n\n00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.420\nSecurity function would\nset up the policies and\n\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.180\nvet the designs to ensure that we,\nin theory, don't have a problem.\n\n00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.570\nBut the way we implement that, may be out\nof our hands from a security standpoint.\n\n00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:37.890\nSo, you do want to\nunderstand that as well.\n\n00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:41.556\nWe have to think about encryption\nobviously on our storage networks,\n\n00:27:41.556 --> 00:27:42.558\nauthentication.\n\n00:27:42.558 --> 00:27:46.766\nRemember data in transit and data at rest\nhave to be encrypted to be protected or\n\n00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:48.248\nthey should be encrypted.\n\n00:27:48.248 --> 00:27:51.397\nI will say to be protected they don't\nhave to be but they should be and\n\n00:27:51.397 --> 00:27:54.938\nof course transiting across those\nprivate networks we should be encrypting\n\n00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:57.210\nthe traffic to make\nsure nobody can see it.\n\n00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.800\nWe should be authenticating connections\nto that storage network using CHAP,\n\n00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.500\nChallenge Handshake\nAuthentication Protocol.\n\n00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:08.230\nOr some sort of authentication mechanism,\nmaybe it's integrated single sign-on.\n\n00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.855\nMaybe it's a Cerberus-based\nsolution with LDAP.\n\n00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.925\nThere's different ways we\ncan do authentication.\n\n00:28:12.925 --> 00:28:15.975\nBut we have to think about the fact that\nthat's gonna be important for us as well.\n\n00:28:15.975 --> 00:28:18.785\nWe have to think about the network and\nthe network controllers.\n\n00:28:18.785 --> 00:28:20.555\nHow do we set up the virtual networking?\n\n00:28:20.555 --> 00:28:22.635\nJust like in the real world,\nI tell my students and\n\n00:28:22.635 --> 00:28:24.105\nmy customers this all the time.\n\n00:28:24.105 --> 00:28:27.540\nEverything you know about\nnetworking in the physical world.\n\n00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.820\nLayer two, layer three, the OSI model.\n\n00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.900\nYou know about layer\ntwo switches probably.\n\n00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:33.830\nAt least we think about\nswitches traditionally and\n\n00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:35.840\nthe OSI models being layer two devices.\n\n00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.420\nYou know about routers at layer three.\n\n00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:41.430\nYou should hopefully know about IP and\nTCP and\n\n00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:44.920\nUDP as protocols, where they live,\nhow they operate.\n\n00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:48.500\nTCP is connection oriented,\nthree way handshake.\n\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.470\nUDP is connection less.\n\n00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.100\nI didn't forget dnd point right.\n\n00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.460\nSubscriber has to request resend\non packets that were lost.\n\n00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:57.830\nYou should understand\nthe basic concepts of this.\n\n00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.630\nIP address are used to deliver, send, and\n\n00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.310\nreceive information using\nIP based routing tables.\n\n00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.830\nWe use Mac addresses at\nlayer two on bridges and\n\n00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.430\nswitches to create Mac address\nbased routing tables for\n\n00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.750\ninternal distribution on the LAN,\nversus external routing on the WAN.\n\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:16.162\nRight, this is basically\nnetworking 101 right.\n\n00:29:16.162 --> 00:29:18.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so we should know all of this,\n\n00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.197\nwe should understand what an IPB Four\naddresses, 32 bit address,\n\n00:29:22.197 --> 00:29:25.700\n192.168.0.1, for instance, right.\n\n00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.967\nA classy address, using a default\nclassy subject mass of the 24 bit\n\n00:29:29.967 --> 00:29:34.985\nsouthern mass for\n255 255 255.0 designation, right?\n\n00:29:34.985 --> 00:29:38.120\nThat stuff should hopefully be\nbaseline knowledge for all of you.\n\n00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:42.360\nIf it's not I would encourage you,\nand again, no shame at all, ever, for\n\n00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.670\nnot knowing something.\n\n00:29:43.670 --> 00:29:46.000\nThe only shame in not knowing\nsomething is not going and\n\n00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.530\nfinding out what you need\nto do to understand it.\n\n00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.100\nThat's the only issue you would have.\n\n00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.208\nSo if you don't know, and\n\n00:29:51.208 --> 00:29:55.480\neven that I just rattled off here in\nthe last three minutes, no problem at all.\n\n00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.230\nWe've got plenty of episodes here\nat ITProTV that will help you\n\n00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:03.260\nto learn about all that stuff, whether\nit's with me, with Daniel, with Don,\n\n00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:04.790\nwith Mike, with whoever, right?\n\n00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.670\nAny of the hosts that you see\npresenting here, go out and look for\n\n00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:13.700\nthings like Network+, any of the basic\nintroductory networking material, probably\n\n00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:19.100\nICND1 or ICND2, and CCNA related material,\nright, for the basic Cisco stuff.\n\n00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:22.189\nAny of those programs will more\nthan adequately prepare you and\n\n00:30:22.189 --> 00:30:25.638\nhelp you to understand the basic\nconcepts we were just talking about.\n\n00:30:25.638 --> 00:30:28.898\nBut the idea is, you should know and\nhave a knowledge of that information\n\n00:30:28.898 --> 00:30:32.587\nin this discussion because that's the kind\nof stuff that we talk about when we talk\n\n00:30:32.587 --> 00:30:35.273\na networking and\nunderstanding how to secure networking.\n\n00:30:35.273 --> 00:30:38.968\nWe gotta make sure we use the right kind\nof IP addresses, we gotta make sure we use\n\n00:30:38.968 --> 00:30:42.609\nthe right kind of protocols, we gotta make\nsure that we are using a right kind of\n\n00:30:42.609 --> 00:30:46.103\narchitecture and infrastructure to\nmanage our networking effectively.\n\n00:30:46.103 --> 00:30:50.948\nSo remember that traditional switches in\nthe physical world outside of the virtual\n\n00:30:50.948 --> 00:30:53.518\nworld of the crowd,\nI get a one in layer two.\n\n00:30:53.518 --> 00:30:57.279\nThey're gonna be managed it if they're\nrunning at layer three and we're gonna\n\n00:30:57.279 --> 00:31:00.828\nhave the ability to do port spanning and\nmonitoring and all the stuff we do.\n\n00:31:00.828 --> 00:31:04.841\nWe're gonna do all the stuff in the cloud,\nand in the physical world, that is outside\n\n00:31:04.841 --> 00:31:08.780\nof the cloud, it exists in the cloud\nslash virtualized world of the cloud.\n\n00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.296\nAnd all that capability,\nall those devices,\n\n00:31:11.296 --> 00:31:13.888\nall that information\nmanagement is all there.\n\n00:31:13.888 --> 00:31:17.677\nWe do have to think about the fact that,\nprobably one of the key differences,\n\n00:31:17.677 --> 00:31:18.902\nwith virtual switches,\n\n00:31:18.902 --> 00:31:22.368\nis that we're not actively physically\nplugging cabling in, right?\n\n00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:25.968\nThe way we would, so cable management\nis basically non existent, right?\n\n00:31:25.968 --> 00:31:29.247\nIn the sense that on the physical plane,\nwe don't have to worry about red code and\n\n00:31:29.247 --> 00:31:32.768\ngreen code, and blue code and yellow code,\nand cables, to understand where they go,\n\n00:31:32.768 --> 00:31:35.788\nwhat they do, I used to hate those\nstupid little label machines, right?\n\n00:31:35.788 --> 00:31:39.940\nBut the reality is, god those punch downs?\n\n00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.230\nGod.\n>> That's a fun time.\n\n00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.380\n>> I used to hate all that.\n\n00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:44.830\n>> I still hate it, which is why I'm\nsmart enough now to pay people to do it.\n\n00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:45.830\n>> That's right, go to cloud.\n\n00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.598\n>> As opposed to have to do it yourself.\n\n00:31:47.598 --> 00:31:51.360\nBut the number of times,that I would just\nbasically fry my fingers trying to do\n\n00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.682\npunch downs, or\ncut cabling over the years.\n\n00:31:53.682 --> 00:31:55.330\n>> The good old days, the good old days.\n\n00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.141\n>> Yeah.\n>> Back when you had to do it yourself,\n\n00:31:57.141 --> 00:31:59.235\ncuz people weren't willing to do it for\nyou.\n\n00:31:59.235 --> 00:32:02.344\nThese days, right, obviously,\nin a virtual environment, in the cloud,\n\n00:32:02.344 --> 00:32:04.395\nwe're not worried about\nphysically cabling up.\n\n00:32:04.395 --> 00:32:05.715\nWe are worried about uplinking.\n\n00:32:05.715 --> 00:32:08.327\nProviding physical connectivity\nfrom the host into\n\n00:32:08.327 --> 00:32:11.126\nthe virtual switch through\nthe virtual network cards.\n\n00:32:11.126 --> 00:32:14.620\nBut we have to still apply the same\nlogic and the same thought process here.\n\n00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:17.790\nSo virtual switches are gonna be\nidentical to our physical switches\n\n00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:19.140\nout in the physical plane.\n\n00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.120\nWe wanna know that.\n\n00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.990\nWe still need network isolation and\nthe thought processes around them.\n\n00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.970\nWhat are some common ways we would think\nabout network isolation being applied?\n\n00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.130\nIf we were to sit down and maybe have\na chat a little bit about security\n\n00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:34.530\narchitecture and isolating traffic on\nthe physical part of the network and\n\n00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.130\nalso on the logical part of the network.\n\n00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.230\nWhat are some things you may think of?\n\n00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.709\n>> First thing that pops in my head,\nobviously, is using VLANs.\n\n00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:42.498\n>> Using VLANs?\n\n00:32:42.498 --> 00:32:45.500\n>> They're a fantastic\nway to segregate data.\n\n00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.460\nI don't need people from HR being able\nto look at developments, traffic.\n\n00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.561\nIt just doesn't make any sense Tends to\nhave those two cross-pollinate, what.\n\n00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:53.336\n>> Okay, so, VLAN's gonna actually.\n\n00:32:53.336 --> 00:32:54.359\nSo VLAN's good.\n\n00:32:54.359 --> 00:32:55.798\n>> Trying to fix some other ways.\n\n00:32:55.798 --> 00:32:57.200\n>> Maybe some tunnels of some kind.\n\n00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.830\n>> Yeah.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.163\n>> Or maybe VPN too.\n\n00:33:00.163 --> 00:33:01.481\n>> Yes, definitely.\n\n00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:03.600\n>> Maybe L2TP with IP sec.\n\n00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.190\nFor instance, hypothetically, a nice Layer\n2 tunnel with some IP security overlay on\n\n00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:11.300\nit, so VPNs, would obviously would\nbe good as well, so we have VLANs,\n\n00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.000\nwe have VPNs, we may go ahead and\nwe may actually,\n\n00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.700\nand not just with VLANs and\nnot just with VPNs, isolate, right?\n\n00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.460\nWe actually create dedicated networks so\nwe were talking about storage,\n\n00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.500\nwe say you don't mention it, we don't want\nHR sitting and poking around and looking\n\n00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:28.320\nat other people's stuff and we don't want\nother people looking at their stuff.\n\n00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.600\nSo we may get HR dedicated network but\nthis logically with the VLAN but\n\n00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.210\nphysically we're gonna provide\nthem their own network so\n\n00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.780\nwe can provide security\nabout the physical layers.\n\n00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:45.330\nWe can air gap networks physically, but\nwe can logically our gap by using VLANs.\n\n00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:47.940\nSo it's a question of\nhow we choose to apply.\n\n00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:52.200\nBut the point would be that with Daniel's\nguidance and things he's recommended,\n\n00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.870\nthings were talking about, we've come up\nall the way to create and work isolation.\n\n00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:59.720\nWe have to in cloud environments because\nwe must in multi-tenant scenarios To\n\n00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.915\nfigure out how to make sure that HR,\nright does it see.\n\n00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:05.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Everything else and we don't see there.\n\n00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:08.500\nHR is now company A,\nother people are companies B, C, and D.\n\n00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.650\nWe have to make sure we keep in violet.\n\n00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.330\nIn other words, essentially make sure that\nno matter what, company's information is\n\n00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:19.100\nnot exposed to anybody but the people that\nare authorized to see it from company A.\n\n00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.740\nSo that's gonna be very important.\n\n00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:25.130\nWe have to think about making sure that\nregardless of the infrastructure we run on\n\n00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.190\nthe virtual plane in the Cloud that\nwe have the appropriate security\n\n00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.490\nthought process, the mind set,\nthe architecture, the security mechanisms.\n\n00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:35.730\nIDS will talk about it up coming episodes.\n\n00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.330\nIntrusion detection systems.\n\n00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.675\nIPS intrusion prevention systems.\n\n00:34:39.675 --> 00:34:43.695\nContinuous monitoring of the host as well\nas the virtual machines are guest app\n\n00:34:43.695 --> 00:34:45.335\noperating systems on top of them.\n\n00:34:45.335 --> 00:34:49.285\nVirtual Machines Inspection,\nVMI is a technology that's very\n\n00:34:49.285 --> 00:34:53.995\nimpotent in the cloud because it allows us\nthrough the hypervisor to peer into and\n\n00:34:53.995 --> 00:34:57.150\nsee what's running and\nhappening on individual VMs.\n\n00:34:57.150 --> 00:35:00.460\nVM by VM guest to us by\nguest to us in the host.\n\n00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.530\nAgentless.\nWe don't have to put additional software\n\n00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.220\nin, we're using the monitoring\ncapabilities and the introspection\n\n00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:11.720\ncapabilities of the hypervisor itself\nto examine and monitor VM work loads.\n\n00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.110\nVery cool technology, very interesting and\nvery very important for\n\n00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:16.870\nus to be aware of as CCSPs.\n\n00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.480\nYou must let me be clear,\nyou must understand VMI,\n\n00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.360\nvirtual machine introspection,\nit is an agentless based system.\n\n00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.570\nNo software required\nother than the hyperviser\n\n00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.890\nthat allows us to essentially monitor and\n\n00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:34.730\nmaintain understanding of what's happening\nper workload, per vm running on the host.\n\n00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.820\nIf you haven't heard about it before gotta\nmake sure you read up on it a little bit.\n\n00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.720\nJust go out and use the old Google\nfinger method there and find VMI, and\n\n00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.690\ndon't search for VMI by the way.\n\n00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:47.380\nYou get Virginia Military Institute\nwhen you do VMI.\n\n00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.810\nYou get a bunch of other stuff as well.\n\n00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:51.190\nBut if you search for\nvirtual machine introspection,\n\n00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.260\nyou will find a link to this information.\n\n00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.100\nMake sure you know this concept.\n\n00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.360\nIt's one of the most important things we\ndo from a virtual security perspective\n\n00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.530\nin the cloud,\nwith regards to virtual machines.\n\n00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:04.160\nWe gotta have the right tools used, and\nthe right tools being made available for\n\n00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.150\nus to drive virtual machine\nsecurity in the cloud.\n\n00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.920\nEvery vendor provides their own set\nof essentially management tools.\n\n00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.870\nVM Ware calls them the VM tools.\n\n00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:16.730\nMicrosoft calls them\nthe integration services.\n\n00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.870\nAnd so, we need to understand that the\nappropriate tools must be maintained and\n\n00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:24.290\ndeployed and the appropriate version of\nthose tools have to be maintained and\n\n00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.950\ndeployed to provide\nthe adequate level of security.\n\n00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:30.130\nThe right kind of drivers, right,\nthe right kind of monitoring capabilities.\n\n00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:34.100\nSo one real, real quick example of this\nin virtual machine infrastructure.\n\n00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.840\nI'll use VMware just as an example.\n\n00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:39.720\nMost of you hopefully have some idea of\nVMware as a company, have been exposed to\n\n00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.280\nvirtual infrastructure, and\nhave a sense of what it does.\n\n00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:47.680\nIn VM works world, when you use the VM\nworld tools, we have a specific driver,\n\n00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.740\ntwo specific drivers I'm thinking of,\nin fact, that are used for\n\n00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.220\nvery specific functions but\ncritical to security.\n\n00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:59.320\nOne of them is going to be the perfmon.dll\ndriver, short for performance monitor,\n\n00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.100\nyou probably are familiar with the concept\nof performance monitoring on Windows.\n\n00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.630\nPerfmon.dll allows us to\ninject Virtual memory and\n\n00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:12.420\nvirtual CPU monitor drivers into the\nperformance monitor of a Windows-based VM\n\n00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.500\nso that from within the VM itself, we can\nmonitor consumption of virtual resources\n\n00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:20.710\nand we can compare that to what we see\non the host monitoring from outside.\n\n00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:24.330\nThis ability to be able to understand both\nsides of that consumption is crucial for\n\n00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.710\nperformance optimization but\nalso for security.\n\n00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:30.530\nSo that way,\nif there is some sort of an attack or\n\n00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.130\nresource issue we'll be notified\nof it as soon as possible.\n\n00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.970\nSo we pair that with VMI and\nwe begin to really get a complete picture\n\n00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.260\nof what's happening with\nregards to security.\n\n00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:43.840\nWe also get another driver,\nwhich is the mem control driver,\n\n00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.460\nthe ballooning driver that\nallows us to pull memory\n\n00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.510\naway from the virtual machine and\nborrow it, essentially.\n\n00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.690\nRemember Blimpy, the character in Popeye?\n\n00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:52.240\n>> Yes.\n\n00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.830\n>> I'll gladly pay you Tuesday for\na hamburger today, right?\n\n00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:58.650\nSo the ideas that we are borrowing memory\nin real time from vm's that are not using\n\n00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:02.660\nit and we are allocating it out to vm's\nthat are under duress or under stress.\n\n00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.600\nIf we have a resource attack,\n\n00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.440\na DoS or DDoS attack, that's occurring,\ntrying to starve hosts and\n\n00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.555\nor resources from VMs on host, the mem\ncontrol driver, the ballooning driver,\n\n00:38:12.555 --> 00:38:16.330\nmay help to offset that long enough that\nwe can figure that out and intercede.\n\n00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.530\nSo these are just two examples\nof how using the right tools\n\n00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:23.330\nwill help us dramatically to improve\nour ability to maintain security.\n\n00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.230\nRemember on this kind of an exam,\n\n00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.650\nwe're not gonna ask you vendor-specific\nquestion about how does\n\n00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.830\nVM ware enhance security using these\ndrivers that I've explained to you.\n\n00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.570\nBut, a generic concept like VMI,\nvery important to know it's\n\n00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.970\nnot vendor specific, and\nyou certainly could be asked about it.\n\n00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.720\nAnd you would wanna know\nabout something like VMI.\n\n00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:46.265\nThings like defense and depth,\naccess control continuous auditing and\n\n00:38:46.265 --> 00:38:47.645\nmonitoring and maintenance.\n\n00:38:47.645 --> 00:38:50.415\nOverall and\npatch management just cycles like that.\n\n00:38:50.415 --> 00:38:53.115\nAll of that is gonna be very,\nvery important for us.\n\n00:38:53.115 --> 00:38:57.175\nRight, to be able to think about it\nconsider it ultimately as we wrap up.\n\n00:38:57.175 --> 00:38:59.555\nThese are all defense in\ndepth things like this.\n\n00:38:59.555 --> 00:39:03.135\nAll leading practices what we call\nbest practices, in our industry.\n\n00:39:03.135 --> 00:39:04.335\n>> Excellent stuff, Adam.\n\n00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:06.720\nYou've definitely laid out how we need to.\n\n00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.760\nBasically we need to bake in security.\n\n00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:12.660\nWe need to build from a security\nstandpoint our actual,\n\n00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.750\nphysical data center when we're\nstarting to implement these things.\n\n00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:19.500\nBecause if we don't it becomes much more\ndifficult to add security later, and\n\n00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.610\neven if we can, then it's really\njust not the best way to go about it\n\n00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:24.830\nbecause there can be hindrances to that.\n\n00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:28.520\nSo, we wanna start from a secure\nfoundation and work our way up,\n\n00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.520\nmake it inherent to our systems.\n\n00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:34.220\nAnd that's really the idea that we\nwanna convey for you guys today.\n\n00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:35.100\nLike you said,\n\n00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:38.500\na data center's a data center whether\nit's in a cloud or it's on your premise.\n\n00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.420\nDoesn't matter where it's at.\n\n00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:43.310\nThe theories behind it still apply.\n\n00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:47.140\nAnd we want that security from\nthe outget if we can make that happen.\n\n00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.320\nAdam, thanks for joining us today.\n\n00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.990\nThanks for reminding us of that fact.\n\n00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.480\nAnd we thank you guys for watching.\n\n00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.330\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.620\nFor ITProTV I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowrie.\n\n00:39:55.620 -->

welcome\nto another great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:18.050\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.810\nIn today's episode we\nare moving forward with our\n\n6\n00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.820\nCertified Cloud Security Professional\nseries.\n\n7\n00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.129\nJoining us back in the studio yet\nagain to lend his giant expertise,\n\n8\n00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:29.260\nhis wealth of knowledge,\nis our good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.811\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n\n10\n00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:32.394\nHow's it going?\n>> Good, good, Giant expertise,\n\n11\n00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:33.904\nwow, that's, okay.\n\n12\n00:00:33.904 --> 00:00:37.794\nDon't know what to say to that other than-\n>> I'm building your mythos\n\n13\n00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:39.722\n>> Wow, yes.\n\n14\n00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:40.254\nOkay.\n\n15\n00:00:40.254 --> 00:00:43.122\nSo here we are, we're going to\nignore Daniel and just keep going.\n\n16\n00:00:43.122 --> 00:00:46.260\nSo let's talk about running\na physical infrastructure.\n\n17\n00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.530\nSo when we talk about running\nphysical infrastructure and\n\n18\n00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.133\nwe talk about the giant knowledge and\nthe requirements of that,\n\n19\n00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.749\nwe gotta work that in\nsomehow I suppose right?\n\n20\n00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.350\nWe've gotta think about\nhow we're actually,\n\n21\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.385\nfrom again the CCSP's perspective,\nas a security focused individual,\n\n22\n00:01:02.385 --> 00:01:05.637\nhow are we gonna bring to the table\nthe thought processes and\n\n23\n00:01:05.637 --> 00:01:08.388\nthe requirements necessary\nto do this securely?\n\n24\n00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:10.260\nWe've been talking about how you plan it,\n\n25\n00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.861\nwe've been talking about how\nyou theoretically build it,\n\n26\n00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:15.790\nnow we gotta talk about how you maintain,\noperate, and run it.\n\n27\n00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.350\nSo now we're gonna focus at that\nlevel in this conversation.\n\n28\n00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.118\nAnd poor considerations as always.\n\n29\n00:01:21.118 --> 00:01:24.399\nLegal concerns, right,\ngovernance risk and compliance come up so\n\n30\n00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.730\nwe gotta think about that.\n\n31\n00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.633\nCompatibility, control, being able\nto see and interdict with data so\n\n32\n00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:34.123\nwe have to be able to understand what's\ngoing on through continuous monitoring,\n\n33\n00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.740\nlogging, and\nanalysis of information flows.\n\n34\n00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.270\nAll this is important.\n\n35\n00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.510\nWe may have PCI DSS concerns\nif we have payment processing\n\n36\n00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.960\nin our network that we\nhave to contend with.\n\n37\n00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.960\nHow about upgrades and\nchanges, swap outs, right?\n\n38\n00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.650\nSo how do we upgrade infrastructure and\nmaintain it over time?\n\n39\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.590\nWe talked about drive failure\nin one of our prior episodes.\n\n40\n00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.670\nHow do we deal with\nfail over technologies?\n\n41\n00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.110\nRight so HA, high availability,\nFT, fall tolerance.\n\n42\n00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.580\nThese are concerns.\n\n43\n00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.030\nCan we use load balancing?\n\n44\n00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.700\nChances are we certainly will and\nwe will do that.\n\n45\n00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.370\nDo we have automated load balancing\nwith technologies like DRS,\n\n46\n00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.210\ndistributed resource scheduling?\n\n47\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.210\nAnd or technologies like that because\nit's called different things by\n\n48\n00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.310\ndifferent vendors depending\non whose product you use, but\n\n49\n00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.390\ngenerically automated load balancing and\nmonitoring of one or more clusters.\n\n50\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.620\nHow do we deal with outsourcing?\n\n51\n00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.690\nHow do we continuously come back to\nthis idea of dealing with vendors and\n\n52\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.620\ndealing with transference of risk.\n\n53\n00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.050\nHow do we deal with virtualization,\nas we've talked about as well.\n\n54\n00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.450\nThis is just a sampling of\nconsiderations that we would have to\n\n55\n00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.630\nthink about as CCSBs.\n\n56\n00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.720\nHow do we deal with secure\naccess to our infrastructure\n\n57\n00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.140\nwhen we're in the data center physically\npresent trying to monitor a stack or\n\n58\n00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.680\na rack of servers,\nwe would traditionally use KVMs right?\n\n59\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.420\nAnd a KVM, more often than not, is gonna\nbe a device that you'll have that may hook\n\n60\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.238\nup anywhere from maybe\n4 to as many as 8 or\n\n61\n00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:58.090\n16 different machines in\na compartmentalized way.\n\n62\n00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.290\nEach one has its own dedicated channel so\nyou can bring it up on the monitor,\n\n63\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.920\nusing the shared monitor keyboard mouse\ninfrastructure, being able to then,\n\n64\n00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.080\ninteract with that machine.\n\n65\n00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.900\nNormal KVMs, while they are very\neffective, and we use them all the time in\n\n66\n00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.100\ndata centers, are not going to process\nisolate each individual channel.\n\n67\n00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.980\nThey're not designed, in other words,\nto prevent signal bleed, and therefore\n\n68\n00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.330\ncrosstalk and perhaps even the ability to\nbe able to see one system from another.\n\n69\n00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.550\nI'm not suggesting that\nhappens all the time but\n\n70\n00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.030\nI am pointing out that non-secure\ndesigned KVMs, specifically normal,\n\n71\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.020\noff the rack, if you will, KVMs,0 just\nKVMs that you buy that are normal,\n\n72\n00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.950\nyou get them from, I don't know,\nwhere do you buy them these days?\n\n73\n00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.050\nNewegg or Amazon or\nwherever you buy them from.\n\n74\n00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.840\nBut when you buy them there, just\na standard off the shelf KVM, is not gonna\n\n75\n00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.860\nhave the process isolation and the logical\nisolation and the tempus shielding and\n\n76\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.830\nall the technologies built into it along\nwith tamper resistant cases and housing.\n\n77\n00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.580\nAnd anti-tamper technology that renders\nthe KVM inoperable if you open it up\n\n78\n00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.955\nto try to tap into these\nindividual circuits.\n\n79\n00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:11.650\nThose secure KVMs are much more expensive\nbut are designed for these multi-tenant\n\n80\n00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.960\nhosting environments in the cloud where\nwe have to isolate everybody's traffic.\n\n81\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.215\nAnd we have to make sure we are taking\nevery step possible as a cloud security\n\n82\n00:04:19.215 --> 00:04:20.259\nprofessional to do so.\n\n83\n00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.445\n>> That Tempest stuff, It's cool,\nit's scary but it's really cool.\n\n84\n00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:27.210\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well it's scary it's also really cool.\n\n85\n00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.030\nIt is essentially fairly basic technology.\n\n86\n00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.570\nThe idea is that we are using\ntraditionally what's known as\n\n87\n00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.240\na Faraday cage.\n\n88\n00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.210\nSome sort of a copper wire mesh shell or\nenclosure, specially treated,\n\n89\n00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.490\nspecially designed to absorb\nthe electromagnetic radiation,\n\n90\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.150\nthe emanations of the electronic signals\nthat are coming off most of these devices.\n\n91\n00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.130\nSo for instance, a set of circuit boards\ninside the KVM dedicated to each channel\n\n92\n00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.440\ncan actually emanate signals and\nbe read from outside the device.\n\n93\n00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.170\nYou wouldn't have to be connected\nto the machine physically\n\n94\n00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.130\nto actually be able to see\nwhat's going on on that machine.\n\n95\n00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.060\nAnd if I pick that information up, I may\nbe able to actually find what you're doing\n\n96\n00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.980\n20, 30 feet away, wherever I'm standing,\nwhatever I'm doing.\n\n97\n00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.030\nBut if we use a secure KVM\nthat shields those signals,\n\n98\n00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.470\nit would essentially stealth the signal,\nkeep it within the box itself.\n\n99\n00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.310\nBecause the box is actually\nthe enclosure of the KVM\n\n100\n00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.990\nis gonna be where the Faraday\ncage is actually built in.\n\n101\n00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.510\nAnd as a result of that, it prevents this\nkind of signal bleed from occurring.\n\n102\n00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.530\nSo it is kinda scary and\ncool technology all at once, but\n\n103\n00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.110\nit's actually just pretty basic science.\n\n104\n00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.060\nWe're absorbing electromagnetic radiation\nby using materials that will not allow\n\n105\n00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.210\nit to propagate out beyond the boundary,\nthen we establish the materials in.\n\n106\n00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.280\nSo that's kinda cool.\n\n107\n00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.780\nPrevents data leakage and as a result\nof that would be a good choice for us.\n\n108\n00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.770\nSo when we think about secure KVM\ndesigns we as I mentioned think\n\n109\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.930\nabout isolated data channels every circuit\ninside has its own dedicated pathway.\n\n110\n00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.190\nTamper resistancy so we make sure we\nhave warning labels on the outside.\n\n111\n00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.810\nWe put those labels over the holes\nwhere the screw access is so\n\n112\n00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.360\nyou have to break the label to get in so\nwe have physical evidence you did that.\n\n113\n00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.350\nWe have typically anti-tamper switches\ninside, so if you open the device up,\n\n114\n00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.030\nyou essentially set a system in motion\nthat fires some sort of switch.\n\n115\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.500\nAnd triggers, basically a kill command,\nor kill capability\n\n116\n00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.040\nto the device that renders it inoperable\nof sending or receiving signals.\n\n117\n00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.080\nSo it's either gotta be reset by\na trained factory professional,\n\n118\n00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.590\nwho obviously has shown and knows how to\ndo this to open it up to maintain it.\n\n119\n00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.360\nOr you blow the device up\nwhen you open it up, right?\n\n120\n00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.940\nNo thermite, that would be really cool.\n\n121\n00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.551\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n122\n00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:32.052\n>> No thermite.\n\n123\n00:06:32.052 --> 00:06:34.457\nBut you essentially just render\nthe device inoperable, so\n\n124\n00:06:34.457 --> 00:06:35.661\nwe call it a kill switch, right?\n\n125\n00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:36.574\nSo you have those, so\n\n126\n00:06:36.574 --> 00:06:40.225\nintrusion detection capabilities\nin the housing, fixed firmware.\n\n127\n00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:43.365\nThe firmware cannot be modified or\nupgraded by you traditionally,\n\n128\n00:06:43.365 --> 00:06:46.555\nit can only be done by\nan authorized factory technician or\n\n129\n00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:50.325\na vendor that has the certain\ncapability or key to do that.\n\n130\n00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:53.605\nSo there's all these different ways right\nthat we would be able to do this thing.\n\n131\n00:06:53.605 --> 00:06:57.785\nIt was not that this relates to secure\nKVM design in any way whatsoever, but\n\n132\n00:06:57.785 --> 00:07:01.185\njust talking about secure design and\nessentially factory overrides and\n\n133\n00:07:01.185 --> 00:07:01.774\nthings like this.\n\n134\n00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:03.960\nSo I travel a great deal for what I do,\n\n135\n00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.630\nand I was in the Caribbean,\nrough as it is, right?\n\n136\n00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.450\n[LAUGH] I was in the Caribbean on\nbusiness a couple of months ago.\n\n137\n00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.520\nAnd the hotel that I was staying at,\nas many hotels do, has a safe in the room.\n\n138\n00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.080\nYou know they always tell\nyou put your stuff in there.\n\n139\n00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.010\nSo when I travel, if I'm overseas,\nI'll put my Passport in there, so\n\n140\n00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.385\nthat nobody runs off with it while I'm\nout of the room, that kind of thing.\n\n141\n00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:26.720\nThrow my phone, my tablet,\nmy laptop, whatever in there.\n\n142\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:28.460\nSo I'd set it up, I'd locked it.\n\n143\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.420\nIt's one of those digital ones\nwhere you punch in the code,\n\n144\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.890\nas most of them are today.\n\n145\n00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.290\nAnd for the life of me, I swear,\nI used a code that I know,\n\n146\n00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.070\nthat it would've been, and\nI go to get this thing open.\n\n147\n00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.700\nI'm trying to get some money and\nmy passport out, and I can't.\n\n148\n00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.740\nAnd I'm punching the code in, can't do it,\ncan't do it, it's not working.\n\n149\n00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.120\nAnd I'm worried about the fact that\neventually if I do it often enough,\n\n150\n00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.620\nit simply locks out.\n\n151\n00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.008\nSo I'm worried about the fact\nthat I may not be able to get in.\n\n152\n00:07:52.008 --> 00:07:54.980\nSo I call down to the desk,\nand said, hey, I've done this.\n\n153\n00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.270\nI'm sure I'm not the first\nperson that's done this.\n\n154\n00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.955\nDo you have a way of resetting it?\n\n155\n00:07:58.955 --> 00:08:00.345\nAbsolutely, no problems, Mr. Gordon.\n\n156\n00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:02.750\nJust gotta make sure you're there\nbecause security will come.\n\n157\n00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.460\nAnd as long as they can prove Who\nyou are that you're in the room.\n\n158\n00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.539\nIt's you.\nIt's not somebody trying\n\n159\n00:08:07.539 --> 00:08:08.053\nto steal your stuff.\n\n160\n00:08:08.053 --> 00:08:10.150\nThen you know we can reset the safe.\n\n161\n00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:11.800\nIt takes about five minutes, no big deal.\n\n162\n00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.070\nI said great,\nwas on my way out to a meeting.\n\n163\n00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.200\nWhen I get back, so met the guy,\ncame up to the room.\n\n164\n00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.480\nAnd it was kind of interesting,\ncuz they have a multi-step process, right?\n\n165\n00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.360\nYou have to, aside from obviously\nauthenticating who you are.\n\n166\n00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.690\nThey come in and there's a maintenance\nguy that does part of the process and\n\n167\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.500\nthen the security guy does the other part.\n\n168\n00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.840\nSo they have a two person rule and\nthey essentially are separating,\n\n169\n00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.770\nthrough separation of duties,\nthe roles involved.\n\n170\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.410\nThe maintenance guy is able to unscrew the\naccess points on the safe that lets you\n\n171\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:44.860\nget in behind the device lock to\nessentially get to the point where you\n\n172\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.740\nthen expose the key area where you can put\na key into override and open the safe.\n\n173\n00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.010\nSo the maintenance guy has to do that.\n\n174\n00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.360\nIt's a special tool and he has to\ncome in and take that part apart.\n\n175\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.930\nAnd then security guy is\nthe guy that has the key.\n\n176\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.867\nSo the two of them together essentially\nhave to operate together to get\n\n177\n00:09:00.867 --> 00:09:01.611\ninto a safe.\n\n178\n00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:04.162\nBecause the maintenance guy\ndoesn't have the key, and\n\n179\n00:09:04.162 --> 00:09:07.680\nthe security guy doesn't have the tool\nto be able to take the safe apart.\n\n180\n00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.840\nSo it's just I was watching all of this,\n\n181\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.430\nit was kinda interesting because\nthis is a secure design, right?\n\n182\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.060\nIt's the exact kind of thing you want.\n\n183\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.120\nMultiple people involved,\nmultiple separation of duty elements and\n\n184\n00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.340\noverall collusion.\n\n185\n00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.130\nEverybody's gotta come together\nto agree this is a good idea for\n\n186\n00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:22.156\nyou to do it, right?\n\n187\n00:09:22.156 --> 00:09:26.620\nSo, this is the kind of thing we think\nabout, safe buffer designing, secure KVMs,\n\n188\n00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.560\nso buffers are not gonna be exposed or\navailable, so no buffer overflows.\n\n189\n00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.440\nWe're input validating and we are checking\nand doing input validation and\n\n190\n00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.900\ncheck, selective USB access.\n\n191\n00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.300\nSo you can't just plug a USB device in,\n\n192\n00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.975\nit has to be pre-authorized,\nthings like that.\n\n193\n00:09:41.975 --> 00:09:45.215\nYou know these are the kind of\ndesign elements we would build in\n\n194\n00:09:45.215 --> 00:09:46.685\nto this particular area.\n\n195\n00:09:46.685 --> 00:09:48.425\nWhat about secure network configuration?\n\n196\n00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:50.595\nFrom a running perspective,\nwhat are we going to do?\n\n197\n00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:53.520\nWe're gonna have to think about, and you\nand I talked about some of this already.\n\n198\n00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.359\nI mentioned in our last episode what are\nsome ways that we may think about securing\n\n199\n00:09:57.359 --> 00:09:57.932\nnetworks?\n\n200\n00:09:57.932 --> 00:10:01.813\nAnd you offered or proferred and\nyou talked about or I added VPNs and\n\n201\n00:10:01.813 --> 00:10:05.397\nwe talked together jointly about\nthe concept of tunneling, right?\n\n202\n00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:08.235\nSo using a VLAN,\nusing TLS, using DNSSEC or\n\n203\n00:10:08.235 --> 00:10:13.073\nIPsec to be able to create secure\nenvironments would be very beneficial and\n\n204\n00:10:13.073 --> 00:10:16.560\nthe CCSP should understand\nthese technologies.\n\n205\n00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.756\nWhen we think about the use of VLANs,\nright?\n\n206\n00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:23.578\nWe think about the idea that we're\ncreating a logical isolation,\n\n207\n00:10:23.578 --> 00:10:27.770\na subnetwork in effect, if you will,\ninside the physical network.\n\n208\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.670\nBut we're doing it isolated,\nright, from everything else.\n\n209\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.190\nBut we're doing it logically,\nwe're assigning essentially a VLAN ID,\n\n210\n00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.630\na numerical equivalent.\n\n211\n00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.405\nNumber 5, number 20,\nnumber 4,001, whatever it is, but\n\n212\n00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:42.682\nwe're tagging all of out\npackage traffic with that ID.\n\n213\n00:10:42.682 --> 00:10:45.680\nIf you're a member of the VLAN,\nif you're able to see the traffic,\n\n214\n00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.810\nit's because you understand that tag and\nyou were essentially member of that group.\n\n215\n00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.830\nIf you don't, you don't see the traffic.\n\n216\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.998\nYou're not able to interact with it\nbecause it's not going to something that's\n\n217\n00:10:54.998 --> 00:10:55.612\nmeant for you.\n\n218\n00:10:55.612 --> 00:10:58.520\nCuz you don't have the tag or\nthe number to allow you to see it.\n\n219\n00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.136\nSo it's a very simple, but\nvery effective way of doing this, right?\n\n220\n00:11:01.136 --> 00:11:04.130\nWhen you think about using IP sec,\nIP security.\n\n221\n00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.184\nWe're thinking about deploying\na technology that allows us to both\n\n222\n00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:10.397\nauthenticate as well as to encrypt.\n\n223\n00:11:10.397 --> 00:11:14.179\nSo we're talking about confidentiality and\nintegrity capability, so\n\n224\n00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:17.217\nthat we do not modify or\nchange data without permission and\n\n225\n00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:20.790\nwe have to validate who we are in\norder to use and see the system.\n\n226\n00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:23.895\nAnd we're encrypting, so\nwe're providing both confidentiality and\n\n227\n00:11:23.895 --> 00:11:28.245\nauthentication as well as integrity\nusing something like IPsec.\n\n228\n00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:32.505\nWhen we use DNSSEC, we essentially\nare using digital signatures and\n\n229\n00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:37.465\nintegrity control to be able\nsign DNS registration records.\n\n230\n00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:39.911\nSo that way we are validating,\n\n231\n00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:44.400\nanother level, another layer of\nauthentication is being added to DNS.\n\n232\n00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.190\nSo that somebody who tries to spoof or\nput in a bad DNS record or\n\n233\n00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.990\ncreate a masquerade or\na redirect attack capability through\n\n234\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:56.690\nmanipulation of DNS registration\nrecords will not be able to.\n\n235\n00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.633\nBecause the records have to be digitally\nsigned in order to be seen as being valid.\n\n236\n00:12:00.633 --> 00:12:03.116\nAnd if we have a copy\nof the certificate or\n\n237\n00:12:03.116 --> 00:12:05.750\na hash that represents that certificate.\n\n238\n00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.445\nSo we can validate the signature,\n\n239\n00:12:07.445 --> 00:12:10.830\ndo a very quick integrity check and\nthe signature matches.\n\n240\n00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.780\nWe're able to then say this is\nthe right registration record.\n\n241\n00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.850\nSo I should go to\nthe Microsoft Exchange or\n\n242\n00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.160\nSharePoint server at 1.3.5.7\nthat's the right IP address.\n\n243\n00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.340\nSo I should go there.\n\n244\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.770\nThe host record says\nthat that's where it is.\n\n245\n00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.366\nOr, if I don't see that authentication, if\nit's not gonna pass the integrity check.\n\n246\n00:12:29.366 --> 00:12:33.154\nI shouldn't go there cuz chances are good\nthat that's probably the bad actor trying\n\n247\n00:12:33.154 --> 00:12:34.766\nto redirect me over there, right?\n\n248\n00:12:34.766 --> 00:12:38.330\nAnd draw me in and put malware on\nmy system or zombie my system and\n\n249\n00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.450\nturn it into a bot or\nwhatever they're gonna do.\n\n250\n00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.770\nSo we want to be using these kinds of\nsecure networking configuration tools and\n\n251\n00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:50.560\ntechnologies to further process these\npieces of information but to do so\n\n252\n00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.570\nin a secure way.\n\n253\n00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.440\nAnd add those layers of complexity,\n\n254\n00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:57.490\nthe defense in depth architectures we\ntalk about, the separation of duties.\n\n255\n00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.930\nAll the things that would be part of\nthis so that we can securely consume.\n\n256\n00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.140\nBut we can do so with the reliability\nhopefully, and the knowledge that we have,\n\n257\n00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.730\nnot just the availability but integrity\nand confidentiality protections in place.\n\n258\n00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.650\n>> Adam, would you be also be able\nto do this with like firewalls?\n\n259\n00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:15.576\nI know that IP tables you can say if a\nconnection is already established then you\n\n260\n00:13:15.576 --> 00:13:16.301\ncan allow it.\n\n261\n00:13:16.301 --> 00:13:19.628\nOr if I wanted to not come from\neven a range of IP addresses, or\n\n262\n00:13:19.628 --> 00:13:23.772\na type of traffic, I could use that\nalso to segregate out traffic, right?\n\n263\n00:13:23.772 --> 00:13:26.813\n>> Sure, we can create isolation at many\ndifferent levels with many different\n\n264\n00:13:26.813 --> 00:13:27.819\nkinds of technologies.\n\n265\n00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:30.390\nSo, using firewalls would\nbe a great example.\n\n266\n00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.590\nWe can do that, whether it's IP tables or\nthe old school version of that,\n\n267\n00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.370\nIP chains, which goes back\nway further than IP tables.\n\n268\n00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.170\nBut IP chains and/or IP tables,\n\n269\n00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.610\nfirewall's essentially in the command\nline interface on a Linux or Unix system.\n\n270\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.620\nWe have graphical interfaces we use for\n\n271\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.710\nfirewalls today as well,\nweb-enabled in many cases.\n\n272\n00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.700\nBut firewalls are firewalls,\nno matter how you create them,\n\n273\n00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:50.870\nno matter how you set them up.\n\n274\n00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.640\nWe could do that with ports, do it with\nprotocols, do it with IP addresses,\n\n275\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.710\nMac addresses traditionally, services.\n\n276\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:01.210\nSome combination of those five things are\nusually gonna be used to create white or\n\n277\n00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:01.960\nblack lists.\n\n278\n00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.700\nWhich essentially is more or\nless what you were describing, right?\n\n279\n00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.100\nAnd the ability to be able to then filter\nand manage against that as a point of\n\n280\n00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.080\ncomparison is a great way to think about\nfurther creating isolation opportunities,\n\n281\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.080\nand carving out secure enclaves, or border\ndefenses that will allow us to create\n\n282\n00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.050\nsecurer and then more or\nless secure environments.\n\n283\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.850\nThings like DMZs would come\ninto play here as well.\n\n284\n00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:25.801\nThings like IDS, intrusion detection.\n\n285\n00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:27.200\nIPS, intrusion prevention.\n\n286\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.270\nThe latest iteration of that that\nIDPS systems, intrusion detection and\n\n287\n00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:32.620\nprevention all together.\n\n288\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.480\nThese would all be part of that,\nwe should use static routing,\n\n289\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.970\nas opposed to dynamic routing.\n\n290\n00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.140\nSo we should try to use static routs\nbetween routes to secure hops and\n\n291\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.950\nto validate path, and\nto hard code our paths.\n\n292\n00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.440\nThat would be another mechanism\nwe could use to create isolation.\n\n293\n00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.850\nWe should also think about\nusing not just firewalls, but\n\n294\n00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.347\nthings like web application firewalls.\n\n295\n00:14:53.347 --> 00:14:56.979\nSpecifically, protocol-based or\napplication-based firewalls that\n\n296\n00:14:56.979 --> 00:15:01.019\nare designed to manage specific traffic\nflows, would also be a great example here\n\n297\n00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:04.545\nof yet another way we could do\nthis from the CCSP's perspective.\n\n298\n00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:06.525\nSo there's all these technologies, right?\n\n299\n00:15:06.525 --> 00:15:09.555\nFrom every layer, essentially,\nof the OSM model, or most layers.\n\n300\n00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:12.135\nWe could find one or\ntwo protection mechanisms.\n\n301\n00:15:12.135 --> 00:15:14.545\nWhat about securing DHCP,\nfor instance, as well?\n\n302\n00:15:14.545 --> 00:15:17.805\nFor dynamic versus static\naddress allocation?\n\n303\n00:15:17.805 --> 00:15:21.045\nWe don't think twice, often,\nabout getting a DHCP based address.\n\n304\n00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:24.445\nSomebody sets up the HTTP,\nwe plug in one or more devices.\n\n305\n00:15:24.445 --> 00:15:26.240\nWe get our address.\n\n306\n00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.770\nWe may have a TTL on the address of eight\nhours, right, for the address lease.\n\n307\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.900\nSo we renew at, theoretically 50% TTL.\n\n308\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.410\nSo we're propagating that address and\nwe keep it for a period of time.\n\n309\n00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.240\nAnd it's in a defined subnet, right,\ninternally on the LAN traditionally,\n\n310\n00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.740\nso we're one of hundreds or\nthousands of machines most likely.\n\n311\n00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.960\nSo giving out dynamic addresses\nis great for a lot of reasons.\n\n312\n00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.481\nBut we don't have control necessarily over\nwhat addresses are given out other than to\n\n313\n00:15:54.481 --> 00:15:56.757\nsay this block of addresses will be given.\n\n314\n00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:59.466\nBut we don't know who they're given to and\nunder what circumstances.\n\n315\n00:15:59.466 --> 00:16:02.706\nSo we may authorize our DHCP servers\nthrough our LDAP provider so\n\n316\n00:16:02.706 --> 00:16:06.790\nwe can register them, so we know we don't\nhave rogue DHCP servers for instance.\n\n317\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.833\nThat's one step we would take So\nauthorization of the DHCP or\n\n318\n00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:15.310\nDNS servers to authorize,\nto operate would be valuable.\n\n319\n00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.710\nWe, in addition,\nwould want to use probably, set asides or\n\n320\n00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:21.450\nreservations in the DHCP infrastructure.\n\n321\n00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.870\nTo hard code certain IP addresses for\ncertain systems.\n\n322\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:27.430\nWe don't want to have\nservers traditionally being\n\n323\n00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.410\ndynamically assigned IPs and\nhaving them change over time.\n\n324\n00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.290\nThat could be a bad thing,\ndenial of service opportunity there,\n\n325\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.330\nwe change out the IP.\n\n326\n00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.095\nAll of a sudden,\nnobody can get to the web server,\n\n327\n00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.870\nbecuase it's not at\nthe same address anymore.\n\n328\n00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.080\nAnd if we're hard coding that\naddress into the application,\n\n329\n00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.530\nnow we've broken that cycle.\n\n330\n00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:47.450\nSo, we want to think about those things\nand potentially take advantage of that.\n\n331\n00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.960\nAs we've said,\nVLANs would also be very helpful here.\n\n332\n00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.480\nYou have VLAN communication, we'll\nisolate the traffic management for us.\n\n333\n00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.040\nAnd we can also think about\nsomething known as a nested VLAN or\n\n334\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.200\na private VLAN or a secondary VLAN.\n\n335\n00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.060\nThey're referred to by different names.\n\n336\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.280\nVLANs inside VLANs essentially,\nis what we can also do.\n\n337\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.970\nSo, we can have a secondary private\nVLAN inside of the primary.\n\n338\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.420\nThat further isolates and\nfurther defines traffic for us.\n\n339\n00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.370\nSo hypothetically,\nwe may create a VLAN that is going to\n\n340\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:18.198\nbroadly encompass a section of our\nnetwork to create a protected enclave.\n\n341\n00:17:18.198 --> 00:17:22.900\nWithin that VLAN, we may have different\nvirtual machines running on several hosts,\n\n342\n00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.890\nwhich is fairly common.\n\n343\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:27.960\nAnd we may want to say, that those\nVM's are going to be a member of one\n\n344\n00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.650\nof several different private\nVLAN's isolated community.\n\n345\n00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:37.360\nOr some sort of VM, that's unique to\nadjust the grouping of individual VMs.\n\n346\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.740\nWe can put them together and\nallowed them to see or\n\n347\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.890\nnot see each other as a further isolation\nprocess assess within the overall VLAN.\n\n348\n00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.200\nThere's a lot of different ways we\ncould potentially architect this.\n\n349\n00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:51.380\nThinking about using TLS,\nTransport Layer Security.\n\n350\n00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.590\nWhere we use X.509 certificates\nto digitally sign and\n\n351\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.960\nmanage the cryptographic protocols.\n\n352\n00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:01.280\nAnd to enable traffic management,\nwould be a good thing to consider.\n\n353\n00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.950\nWe want to use encryption, in other words,\non the data pathway and the data flow.\n\n354\n00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.990\nWe've talked a lot about this and\nwhy this is important.\n\n355\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:12.890\nWe mentioned DNS and using DNS SEC and\ncontrolling for the registration records.\n\n356\n00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:16.520\nFor all of this infrastructure and\nmanaging it and maintaining it.\n\n357\n00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.020\nWoe to the CCSB, who deploys DNS\nwithout using DNS SEC today.\n\n358\n00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:26.750\nIt is so common sense, it is so basic,\nin terms of the protection architecture.\n\n359\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.420\nAnd it is so relatively,\nfundamentally easy to deploy.\n\n360\n00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.260\nThat there really is not a good reason for\n\n361\n00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.280\nyou to deploy DNS today\nwithout using DNS Sec.\n\n362\n00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.890\nAnd yet, we see it time and time again.\n\n363\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.370\nThat many systems are run without DNS Sec.\n\n364\n00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.950\nIt's relatively newer thought process.\n\n365\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.150\nMany old DNS implementations\nthat have been around for\n\n366\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.180\na long time may not have\nhad DNS Sec applied.\n\n367\n00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.450\nIt's something that\nusually can be supported,\n\n368\n00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.690\nit's just a matter of making sure you're\nrunning the right version of DNS.\n\n369\n00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:53.860\nIt's not a Microsoft only thing,\nby the way, right.\n\n370\n00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.020\nSo it could be applied\non DNS infrastructure,\n\n371\n00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.840\nregardless of the kind of\nDNS that we support and run.\n\n372\n00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.940\nAnd it's usually not much more than just\na couple of steps and probably a wizard or\n\n373\n00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.720\nsome sort of step by step\nprocess to enable it.\n\n374\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:10.134\nYou have to set up the zone obviously and\nonce the zone and name space is set up.\n\n375\n00:19:10.134 --> 00:19:13.010\nYou're going to have to apply\nDNS set to that system but\n\n376\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.670\nwe essentially are going to allow for\nthe digitally signing.\n\n377\n00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:21.210\nAs I said, of these registration records,\nusing a set of digital certificates and\n\n378\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.200\nencryption keys to validate identity.\n\n379\n00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.430\nSo, this just makes tremendous sense.\n\n380\n00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.210\nWe essentially,\n\n381\n00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.040\nare using a suite of extensions that\nadd on security to the DNS protocol.\n\n382\n00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.050\nCommonly accepted and\ncommonly supported today.\n\n383\n00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:37.400\nWe provide origin authority,\nwe provide data integrity and\n\n384\n00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.160\nauthenticated denial of existence.\n\n385\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.230\nSo as a result,\n\n386\n00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.400\nwe essentially have non-repudiation\nbeing applied with DNS Sec.\n\n387\n00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.810\nSo, we want to make sure that we\ncan use this kind of technology.\n\n388\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.650\nDo you guys use the DNS SEC when you,\n\n389\n00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.420\nor did you use the DNS SEC\nrather I should say than do you.\n\n390\n00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.640\nDid you, because you're not there now?\n\n391\n00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.430\nBut did you use the DNS SEC\nwhen you were at the bureau?\n\n392\n00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.700\n>> I want to say that we did\nnot to be honest with you.\n\n393\n00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.368\n>> Okay.\n[INAUDIBLE] May not have because you\n\n394\n00:20:01.368 --> 00:20:02.007\nwere there so far.\n\n395\n00:20:02.007 --> 00:20:02.617\n[CROSSTALK] So\n\n396\n00:20:02.617 --> 00:20:06.228\nlong ago that it probably wasn't\nprevalent back then is what I'm thinking.\n\n397\n00:20:06.228 --> 00:20:10.179\nAnd it was not probably something that\nyou would've used but these days,\n\n398\n00:20:10.179 --> 00:20:12.040\nlast couple of years especially.\n\n399\n00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.570\nWith a lot of the attacks that\nwe've been seeing happening,\n\n400\n00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.490\nDNS sec has become something a lot\nof people are talking about.\n\n401\n00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:21.420\nWhile we're talking real quick,\ncan you google DNS sec and maybe,\n\n402\n00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:25.610\njust quickly find us a good site for\nhey here's what it is,\n\n403\n00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.860\nhere's how you implement it,\nhere's a good overview?\n\n404\n00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.990\nAnd maybe, we could just, when you're\nready throw that up real quick.\n\n405\n00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.760\nLet that kind folk out\nthere in our audience just\n\n406\n00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.392\nhave a sense where they may go to\nfind some information about it.\n\n407\n00:20:35.392 --> 00:20:37.930\nIn case,\nthey are not comfortable with the concept.\n\n408\n00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.878\n>> Here we go I got I got\nicann.org they have a resource\n\n409\n00:20:40.878 --> 00:20:41.400\n>> Okay good, so\n\n410\n00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.740\ncan we just take a look at Daniel's\ndesktop, there we go real quick.\n\n411\n00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.560\nAnd so, I don't know what's on the page\nhere, I can't see it, but maybe,\n\n412\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.770\nyou can just,\ndo they have a nice little overview there?\n\n413\n00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.740\n>> Yeah, on the left they\ntalk about ICan says, DNSSEC,\n\n414\n00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.290\nwhat is it and why is it important?\n\n415\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:55.790\n>> Good, good.\n\n416\n00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.045\n>> And the page is apparently\n>> I have an archive,\n\n417\n00:20:58.045 --> 00:21:01.115\nbut they just have\na good general overview.\n\n418\n00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:05.371\nAnd of course I'm going to\ngo to tracking cookies.\n\n419\n00:21:05.371 --> 00:21:06.590\n[LAUGH] Warning here.\n[CROSSTALK] What's the root zone?\n\n420\n00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:08.685\nSign the root, why do we need to do that?\n\n421\n00:21:08.685 --> 00:21:09.675\nWhat is DNS 6?\n\n422\n00:21:09.675 --> 00:21:11.293\nThey actually did a pretty\ngood job here [CROSSTALK].\n\n423\n00:21:11.293 --> 00:21:15.773\nSo you can read up a little bit on it\nif you're not familiar with it, so\n\n424\n00:21:15.773 --> 00:21:17.125\nthere you go.\n\n425\n00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:20.515\nSo what are some threats to DNS server\ninfrastructure that DNS set potentially\n\n426\n00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:21.670\ncan help us to avoid?\n\n427\n00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.710\n>> Things like foot printing,\nsomebody's going to come and\n\n428\n00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.420\nprobe our systems looking for\nwhat version of DNS we may be running.\n\n429\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.880\nIs it Windows based, is it Unix and\nLinux based with bind?\n\n430\n00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:32.240\nRight?\nWe want to know that and\n\n431\n00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.980\nwe can tell that if we foot print or\nprobe the system.\n\n432\n00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.600\nSo we want to figure out that and\n\n433\n00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.880\nobviously DNS second\nhelp is to prevent that.\n\n434\n00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.230\nA denial of service attack,\n\n435\n00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.170\ndata modification attacks,\nredirection spoofing.\n\n436\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.860\nDNS can prevent or\n\n437\n00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.360\nhelp to defend against all of these\nattacks in one way or another.\n\n438\n00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.230\nBecause we're not going to give\nout information unless it is\n\n439\n00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.270\nan authorized recipient.\n\n440\n00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.740\nAnd we can validate identity and\n\n441\n00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.820\nwe're not going to consume that\ninformation as well, unless we do that.\n\n442\n00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.820\nSo as a result,\n\n443\n00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:02.125\nwe're setting up a Your communication\npathway on both sides of that divide.\n\n444\n00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:04.615\nVery important for us to think about,\nas I scroll through and\n\n445\n00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:07.905\nconsider this move down my list to\ntopics to talk about with you here.\n\n446\n00:22:07.905 --> 00:22:11.460\nWe've mentioned IP sec,\nwe want to make sure we know that IP sec\n\n447\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.218\nInternet protocol security is\nwhat IPsec actually stands for.\n\n448\n00:22:14.218 --> 00:22:17.470\nIt's going to be a set of communication\nprotocols that are going to allow for.\n\n449\n00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.858\nAs I said, authentication and\nconfidentiality protections to be applied.\n\n450\n00:22:21.858 --> 00:22:25.070\nWe're going to be able to do mutual\nauthentication between endpoints\n\n451\n00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:26.730\nat the beginning of our session.\n\n452\n00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.630\nAnd then negotiate cryptographic\nprotections to ensure confidentiality.\n\n453\n00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:35.400\nSo we want to make sure we know about\nIPSEC, IPSEC really, really important.\n\n454\n00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:41.150\nIt would be very foolhardy of the CCSP to\nallow traffic to be run on your networks,\n\n455\n00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.180\nif you're not encrypting it in some form.\n\n456\n00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.000\nAn IPSEC is traditionally,\none of the ways we do that.\n\n457\n00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.960\nA lot of times people, many of\nthe security professionals that I talk to,\n\n458\n00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.150\nmany people, many customers,\nmany students that I talk to.\n\n459\n00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:53.640\nSay, well we need encryption,\n\n460\n00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.720\nwe know we need that on the wire\noutside the boundary, right.\n\n461\n00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.590\nOutside the perimeter,\nbeyond the gates if you will.\n\n462\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:03.770\nRight, so we do that on the outbound leg,\nwe do it with VPNs,\n\n463\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:06.650\nwith tunnels, so we use LTTP with IP sec.\n\n464\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.380\nBut Adam, internally, behind the firewall,\n\n465\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.630\ninside the DMZ, on the LAN, we don't\nbother to do that encryption stuff.\n\n466\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.860\nBecause we trust everybody, right?\n\n467\n00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:18.930\nBoy, is that a hoot and a half and\nholler to have in a conversation.\n\n468\n00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:21.850\nWe trust everybody, well okay, I get that.\n\n469\n00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.020\nMaybe people who work for\nyou are trustworthy and\n\n470\n00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.680\nyou believe fundamentally in the human.\n\n471\n00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.880\nIn the innate goodness of human beings,\nas laughable as that may be but\n\n472\n00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.410\nyou do, no problem.\n\n473\n00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.970\nSo here's the issue though, right.\n\n474\n00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.600\nIf you've never had a bad actor,\nan internal bad actor,\n\n475\n00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.270\nan internal threat issue, great.\n\n476\n00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.600\nAnd there are many companies\nthat will never experience one.\n\n477\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:40.020\nBut there are many companies that do and\n\n478\n00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:42.500\nthey usually don't ever see\nit coming until it happens.\n\n479\n00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.240\nAnd we talk about planning\nto be successful a lot\n\n480\n00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.500\nas I talk through these\nmaterial items with you.\n\n481\n00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:50.480\nAnd the idea is, that it's too late\nto provide that encryption protection\n\n482\n00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:54.060\nbehind the wire, or excuse me,\nbehind the perimeter on the wire.\n\n483\n00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.314\nAfter somebody has already\nstarted to snoop traffic,\n\n484\n00:23:56.314 --> 00:23:59.356\nbecause essentially at that point,\nthey've already seen everything.\n\n485\n00:23:59.356 --> 00:24:01.829\nSo you're goingto lock the door\nafter they've broken in and\n\n486\n00:24:01.829 --> 00:24:03.195\nhope that they don't come back.\n\n487\n00:24:03.195 --> 00:24:06.540\nThat's good, but wouldn't it have been\nbetter if you prevented them from getting\n\n488\n00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.466\nin in the first place?\n\n489\n00:24:07.466 --> 00:24:11.007\nSo while we often talk about applying\nIPsec, we don't always know and\n\n490\n00:24:11.007 --> 00:24:15.090\nunderstand and make the distinction that\nwe should indeed, if at all possible,\n\n491\n00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.420\napply it across the network,\nboth on the LAN and the WAN.\n\n492\n00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.930\nAnd because we missed that,\n\n493\n00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.650\nwe missed a golden opportunity to make\nsure we are safeguarding that information.\n\n494\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.290\nSo think about that, right,\nI don't want you to get caught short.\n\n495\n00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:26.970\nBut essentially,\n\n496\n00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.770\nauthentication, data origination\nauthentication, data integrity,\n\n497\n00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:36.330\nencryption and reply protection are all\nthe thing that IPsec actually provides.\n\n498\n00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.390\nAnd we wanna make sure we\nare thinking about that.\n\n499\n00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:42.480\nBut as I said, there maybe challenges\nwith IPsec, not just from the perspective\n\n500\n00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.780\nof hey, I only use it as\nan external configuration item.\n\n501\n00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.712\nWe gotta get over that.\n\n502\n00:24:46.712 --> 00:24:48.840\nWe gotta get you thinking\nabout using it internally, but\n\n503\n00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.970\npeople often feel it's very\ncomplicated to deploy.\n\n504\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.020\nIt's really not.\n\n505\n00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:54.550\nPeople often feel that it\nimpacts performance negatively\n\n506\n00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:56.360\nbecause it's encrypting traffic, and\n\n507\n00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.000\nthere is a certain degree, a certain\namount of truth to that statement.\n\n508\n00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.290\nAnything we do to encrypt traffic does\npotentially impact performance, but\n\n509\n00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:06.790\nwe can offset that performance\nnegative with accelerators,\n\n510\n00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.000\nwith load balancers, with stronger and\n\n511\n00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.730\nmore efficient routing, oversight in\nmanagement, with faster networks.\n\n512\n00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:16.865\nSo if we're using 10 gig versus 100 meg,\n\n513\n00:25:16.865 --> 00:25:20.168\nwe're not gonna notice the difference\non encryption and decryption.\n\n514\n00:25:20.168 --> 00:25:23.578\nAll right, we can use applications\nthat are scaled specifically and\n\n515\n00:25:23.578 --> 00:25:26.006\ndesigned to support the use\nof this technology.\n\n516\n00:25:26.006 --> 00:25:29.966\nThere's so many ways that we could offset\nthese issues today, that it's really not\n\n517\n00:25:29.966 --> 00:25:33.591\nthe compelling argument it was years ago,\nwhere people would say well yeah,\n\n518\n00:25:33.591 --> 00:25:36.085\nI put IPsec on, and\nmy network has slowed to a crawl.\n\n519\n00:25:36.085 --> 00:25:38.403\nWell yeah, on a 100 megabit network,\nit's gonna be slower.\n\n520\n00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:40.763\nThere's no doubt about it,\nbecause everything is slower.\n\n521\n00:25:40.763 --> 00:25:44.220\nBut the reality is we tend to run\nat least on a gigabit if not 10\n\n522\n00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.360\ngigabit networks today internally.\n\n523\n00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.460\nI'm not talking about out on the WAN\nobviously you're at the mercy of\n\n524\n00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:53.780\nthe lowest common denominator there right,\nthe 56k baud modem dial up that you've\n\n525\n00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.220\nhit somewhere between you and\nwhere you're going.\n\n526\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:26:00.330\nBut the reality of that is that\nthat's not something that we control.\n\n527\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.620\nThat's beyond our control, right?\n\n528\n00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:05.780\nSo we put encryption out on the wire and\nwe let the service providers figure out\n\n529\n00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.172\nhow to optimize in QoS and\nmanage that traffic on their frames,\n\n530\n00:26:09.172 --> 00:26:12.565\non their ATM systems,\non their MPLS systems, whatever it is.\n\n531\n00:26:12.565 --> 00:26:16.214\nThat's not our problem unless we're\na tier one bandwidth provider.\n\n532\n00:26:16.214 --> 00:26:20.190\nThen it's definitely our problem but\nwe're only taking care of that one piece.\n\n533\n00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:21.730\nWe're not worried about data security.\n\n534\n00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.520\nWe worried about bandwidth optimization.\n\n535\n00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.820\nSo my point is, control what you can.\n\n536\n00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:29.250\nWorry about the things\nwithin your purview.\n\n537\n00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.190\nDon't sweat the details on the stuff\nthat's beyond your control\n\n538\n00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:34.850\ncuz you're not gonna fix it\nno matter how hard you try.\n\n539\n00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:38.930\nSo control the things that you can\ncontrol for and get good at those things.\n\n540\n00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:41.368\nAnd then pay somebody else,\nor get somebody else.\n\n541\n00:26:41.368 --> 00:26:45.008\nOr worry about having somebody else take\ncare of the stuff that's beyond your\n\n542\n00:26:45.008 --> 00:26:45.532\ncontrol.\n\n543\n00:26:45.532 --> 00:26:48.040\nThat's a very important thought\nprocess when we think about that.\n\n544\n00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.140\nAt least I think it's\npretty important anyway.\n\n545\n00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.813\nIt takes away a lot of the underlying\nconcerns and causes for consternation, yet\n\n546\n00:26:53.813 --> 00:26:57.280\nalone staying up late at night and\nhaving to worry about all of these things.\n\n547\n00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.520\nI had this conversation with one\nof my customers recently, right?\n\n548\n00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.680\nThey were talking about the fact\nthat they were worrying about\n\n549\n00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.010\ndeploying encryption across\nthe entire message path,\n\n550\n00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:09.860\nthe data path, because they don't\ncontrol elements of the network.\n\n551\n00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:10.870\nI said, well so what?\n\n552\n00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:14.220\nThat's an even more of\na reason to deploy encryption.\n\n553\n00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.440\nCuz you don't control\nelements of the network path.\n\n554\n00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.700\nYou don't want the other people that\ncontrol it reading your data, going,\n\n555\n00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.972\nyeah this looks good, let's take this,\nwhen you're not there.\n\n556\n00:27:22.972 --> 00:27:24.920\nRight, so\nthat's the absolute compelling reason,\n\n557\n00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.670\nthe most important reason to do that.\n\n558\n00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.030\nSo asset management, right?\n\n559\n00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.970\nWe gotta think about all the assets,\ngotta think about system baselines.\n\n560\n00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:34.870\nGotta think about automation,\ngotta think about change management,\n\n561\n00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:40.000\nnetwork bandwidth, security, name\nregistration, secure design on the KVMs.\n\n562\n00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.850\nThere's so\nmany things that CCSPs have to consider.\n\n563\n00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.949\nRight, we have to think about how\nwe're gonna securely deploy all this\n\n564\n00:27:46.949 --> 00:27:49.584\ninfrastructure, how we're\ngonna securely manage it all,\n\n565\n00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:50.888\nwhat we're gonna do with it.\n\n566\n00:27:50.888 --> 00:27:54.569\nAnd how we are going to\nessentially not only isolate it,\n\n567\n00:27:54.569 --> 00:27:58.028\nbut monitor and\nmaintain viability of it over time.\n\n568\n00:27:58.028 --> 00:28:00.229\nThings like stand alone hosts right,\n\n569\n00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:04.630\nhosts that may be running isolated either\nin the DMZ or behind the firewall in\n\n570\n00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.894\na protected enclave somewhere have\nto be managed, have to be monitored,\n\n571\n00:28:08.894 --> 00:28:13.048\nas do resource pools for clusters\nof hosts that provide capabilities.\n\n572\n00:28:13.048 --> 00:28:16.150\nBoth have the same kinda\nsecurity concerns.\n\n573\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:18.480\nSomebody gets in,\ndoes a root escalation, or\n\n574\n00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.050\na provoked escalation attack,\nperforms a DOS, Denial Of Service, or\n\n575\n00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.840\nDDOS, Distributed Denial Of Service\nattack, against that infrastructure.\n\n576\n00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.090\nTries to insert malware and\nsomehow gain advantage, and\n\n577\n00:28:29.090 --> 00:28:32.050\nmaybe put a root kit in there,\nput a back door in there, so\n\n578\n00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:35.920\nthere's a trojan, that we can use\nto bot or zombie the machine.\n\n579\n00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.950\nThere's all sorts of things that can go\nwrong, and we have to understand that\n\n580\n00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:44.390\nfrom a security standpoint,\nwhether we have standalone hosts or\n\n581\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:48.750\npools, resource pools or\nclusters of hosts running together.\n\n582\n00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.580\nThe thought process should be identical,\n\n583\n00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.760\nit should be the same from\na security standpoint.\n\n584\n00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.660\nThere may be GRC governance risk and\ncompliance activities and concerns here.\n\n585\n00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.682\nWe may, from a regulation perspective,\nhave to run certain systems,\n\n586\n00:29:00.682 --> 00:29:03.239\nstand alone and\nisolated in order to comply.\n\n587\n00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:05.418\nAnd we have to understand that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n588\n00:29:05.418 --> 00:29:09.395\nSo there may be certain networks that have\nto be isolated in order to be compliant.\n\n589\n00:29:09.395 --> 00:29:13.335\nSo if you think about maybe in\nthe United States, certainly and\n\n590\n00:29:13.335 --> 00:29:16.475\naround the world, money transfer\nnetworks that banks maintain.\n\n591\n00:29:16.475 --> 00:29:18.855\nThese are isolated and\nrun separate from anything else.\n\n592\n00:29:18.855 --> 00:29:20.105\nThe fed wire network,\n\n593\n00:29:20.105 --> 00:29:23.800\nwhich is the transfer system that\nis used by the US Federal Reserve\n\n594\n00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.060\nto move money not only between banks\nin the US but around the world.\n\n595\n00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:31.240\nBecause most banks rely on the Fed\ntransfer system to move money, right?\n\n596\n00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.270\nSo if you think about that they're\nworking on how highly defended, and\n\n597\n00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:38.350\nhow tightly secured, and how isolated that\nnumber occurs from everything around it.\n\n598\n00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.110\nThat's the kind of thing we may\nhave to do to be compliant.\n\n599\n00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.780\nMaybe now, but we may.\n\n600\n00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.060\nSo we have to think about the fact that if\nwe have to run isolated infrastructure and\n\n601\n00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.260\nwe're hosting on the cloud,\nwe have to tell our service provider that.\n\n602\n00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.650\nWe have to make arrangements for that.\n\n603\n00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.660\nWe need dedicated resources.\n\n604\n00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.810\nWe're not gonna be in a multi-tenant\nenvironment where we wanna share.\n\n605\n00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.090\nWe have to be on our own infrastructure\nseparated physically and\n\n606\n00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:03.320\nlogically from everybody around us.\n\n607\n00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.055\nAnd that's gonna require additional\nconcerns, capabilities, oversight,\n\n608\n00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:10.078\nand thought process around\nmanagement as well as dollar signs.\n\n609\n00:30:10.078 --> 00:30:13.444\nRight, we're gonna add some zeroes\nto that check to get that dedicated\n\n610\n00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:14.600\ninfrastructure.\n\n611\n00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.030\nBut we can do that today.\n\n612\n00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.960\nRemember, if we're doing\nthe on-prem private cloud\n\n613\n00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.100\nwe can dedicate those resources as\nwell and run those isolated systems.\n\n614\n00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.530\nBut we just have to know that and\ncarve that out.\n\n615\n00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.639\nWe should be able to contend with\nthose design constraints and\n\n616\n00:30:28.639 --> 00:30:31.228\nunderstand how to deal with\nthose issues as CCSPs.\n\n617\n00:30:31.228 --> 00:30:35.187\nWhen we think about allocating resources\nfrom a resource sharing perspective,\n\n618\n00:30:35.187 --> 00:30:38.210\nwe have to understand how to give out and\nconsume and modify and\n\n619\n00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.980\ncontrol through what's called\nreservations, shares, and limits.\n\n620\n00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:46.280\nThe amount of resources we will be\nable to grant, either to an individual\n\n621\n00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.790\nin a multi-tenant environment, or\nto an individual VM running on a host,\n\n622\n00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.480\nor from one host to another in\na resource pool in a cluster.\n\n623\n00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.490\nWe have to think about how to control for\nthis.\n\n624\n00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.921\nReservations essentially are gonna\nbe define as guaranteed minimums,\n\n625\n00:31:00.921 --> 00:31:05.567\nif I have a reservation I'm guaranteeing\nyou are certain amount of memory or\n\n626\n00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:06.888\nto CPU on the system.\n\n627\n00:31:06.888 --> 00:31:09.968\nThis is really where we see this\ntechnology being focused on.\n\n628\n00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:13.661\nWe focus on memory and we focus on\nCPU when we talk about reservations,\n\n629\n00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:16.260\nshares and limits, not network bandwidth.\n\n630\n00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.900\nAlthough we do have that capability to\nessentially create resource pools and\n\n631\n00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.430\nmanage bandwidth the same way.\n\n632\n00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.820\nBut it's dealt with separately.\n\n633\n00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.150\nThe concepts are the same and\nwe can obviously carve up storage and\n\n634\n00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.930\ngive you storage access as well.\n\n635\n00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:30.550\nBut we traditionally talk about CPU and\n\n636\n00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:33.180\nmemory when we think about\nreservation shares and limits.\n\n637\n00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:35.520\nSo a reservation's a guaranteed minimum.\n\n638\n00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.760\nA limit is a maximum.\n\n639\n00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:39.510\nThink of the reservation as\nbeing the floor, if you will,\n\n640\n00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.710\nright, the thing you stand on.\n\n641\n00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.915\nThe limit is gonna be the ceiling,\nit's the maximum.\n\n642\n00:31:43.915 --> 00:31:45.370\nWe can't go above that.\n\n643\n00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:49.309\nShares are gonna be used only in most\nsituations where we have to fight for\n\n644\n00:31:49.309 --> 00:31:50.028\nresources.\n\n645\n00:31:50.028 --> 00:31:53.326\nWhen there's not enough,\nthere's what we call contention and\n\n646\n00:31:53.326 --> 00:31:56.208\nwe have to fight to get what\nwe think we're entitled to.\n\n647\n00:31:56.208 --> 00:32:00.727\nSo if everybody is well fed, well watered,\nwell cared for and there's no need for\n\n648\n00:32:00.727 --> 00:32:04.263\nmore resources cuz there's excess\ncapacity in the system, and\n\n649\n00:32:04.263 --> 00:32:07.560\nwe're not consuming it all,\nwe never worry about shares.\n\n650\n00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.760\nWe just worry about reservations and\nlimits.\n\n651\n00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:13.639\nBut when we have to deal with shares,\nit's when we have too much demand and\n\n652\n00:32:13.639 --> 00:32:15.780\nnot enough, unfortunately, supply.\n\n653\n00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:18.330\nAnd because of that,\nwe have to fight over what's left.\n\n654\n00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:22.390\nSo shares help us to figure out\nhow to prioritize resource access,\n\n655\n00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.870\nwhen there is a resource\ncontention situation.\n\n656\n00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.640\nEvery vendor implements that\ntechnology a little bit differently.\n\n657\n00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.250\nEvery vendor may have a different take\non that, whether it's a numerical value,\n\n658\n00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.040\nwhether it's something like low,\nmedium, high.\n\n659\n00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.200\nWhether you have a custom option to input,\n\n660\n00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.230\nit's a percentage of the resources\nthat are left over and are allocated\n\n661\n00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:45.280\nbased on your draw on that resource pool\nversus the overall outstanding amount.\n\n662\n00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.710\nIt's essentially a mathematical formula.\n\n663\n00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.860\nBut that's how we deal\nwith something like that.\n\n664\n00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.190\nAnd so reservation shares and\nlimits become very important as well.\n\n665\n00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:56.580\nWe talked about DRS,\nDistributed Resource Scheduling and or\n\n666\n00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:58.230\nCompute Resource Scheduling, CRS.\n\n667\n00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:01.590\nIt's called, as I said,\ndifferent things by different vendors.\n\n668\n00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.590\nMany vendors will refer to it in one or\nthe other way.\n\n669\n00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:07.900\nVM ware, for instance, and\nOracle both call it DRS.\n\n670\n00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.900\nOther vendors will call it CRS or\neven have another name for it.\n\n671\n00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:15.150\nWhatever it is, the point is, it's\nessentially self-regulating if you set it\n\n672\n00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:19.550\nup the right way, automated load balancing\nand monitoring of clustered resources\n\n673\n00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.920\nin a cloud environment, in a virtualized\nenvironment for the cloud.\n\n674\n00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.830\nThis is how we allocate resources,\n\n675\n00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.760\nhow we control access through\nreservation shares and limits and\n\n676\n00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.490\nhow we load balance, the use of those\nresources by moving infrastructure.\n\n677\n00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.150\nBy essentially either moving hosts and\nadding them or removing them into and\n\n678\n00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:36.270\nout of the cluster.\n\n679\n00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:40.280\nAnd, or by ultimately moving\nVirtual Machines, guest operating systems.\n\n680\n00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.670\nAnd moving them across the cluster,\nbetween hosts, to balance out the load and\n\n681\n00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.300\nbalance out the CPU and the memory of\nthe network, and the storage allocations.\n\n682\n00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.270\nCuz we could do this with both the compute\nresources, the CPU and the memory, and\n\n683\n00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:56.110\nwe could also do it with the storage\nback ends, where we have the ability\n\n684\n00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.960\nto load balance the storage clusters\nas well using this kind of technology.\n\n685\n00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.770\nSo it's actually pretty cool technology.\n\n686\n00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:06.520\nWhen you think about it, it gives us\neither manual, semi-automated, or\n\n687\n00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.720\nfully automated capabilities to monitor.\n\n688\n00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.860\nSo we can automate a lot of these\nprocesses, and as a result we're\n\n689\n00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.040\na lot more happy, probably, at the end of\nthe day with the outcomes and the results.\n\n690\n00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.540\n>> Yeah, a lot more efficient as well.\n\n691\n00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.990\n>> Well it's obviously gonna\nbe a lot more efficient, and\n\n692\n00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:23.060\nit's also gonna give us that granular\nlevel of control, but allow us to scale.\n\n693\n00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.160\nRemember, the issue with the cloud\nprimarily is the elasticity of\n\n694\n00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:26.820\nthe cloud, right?\n\n695\n00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.160\nThe mega scaling that takes place.\n\n696\n00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.370\nIf we go from 100 hosts to a thousand\nhosts running and the data center in\n\n697\n00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.600\na short period of time because of dynamic\npower management, spinning up let's say.\n\n698\n00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:41.040\nRight?\nAnd allocating resources to meet load.\n\n699\n00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.230\nWe may not have enough human beings and\nhands running around.\n\n700\n00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:47.700\nTo be able to actually monitor all\nthat infrastructure in real time.\n\n701\n00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:51.010\nWe need technology like this that helps us\nto automate to allow us to get a better\n\n702\n00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:54.130\nsense of how that's gonna behave and\nwhat we can expect.\n\n703\n00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.970\nWe have to meet our labor\nrequirements with up time so\n\n704\n00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:59.120\nyou know if the escalator\nis gonna be violated,\n\n705\n00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:02.550\nbecause we can't monitor that effectively,\nit's gonna be a huge issue for us.\n\n706\n00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.570\nWe gotta be thinking about that as well.\n\n707\n00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:08.400\nSo clustering capabilities,\nvery important to pull resources together.\n\n708\n00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.080\nPut hosts together, and allow us to\nthen be able to get the benefit of that.\n\n709\n00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.720\nTightly coupled clusters that are gonna\nbe physically in the same space.\n\n710\n00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:20.710\nOr geo-clustering that are separated\nout that are managed through automated\n\n711\n00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.430\nis really one of the only\nways we can do this today.\n\n712\n00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.910\nIf you think about the fact that\nyou've gotta run around and\n\n713\n00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.490\ncable up all these things behind\nthe scenes trying to connect them.\n\n714\n00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.780\nAnd there would be no way for you to do\nthis, so it would have to be automated,\n\n715\n00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:31.190\nso we have to think about that.\n\n716\n00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:34.920\nWe also, from a security perspective, want\nto think about maintenance modes, right?\n\n717\n00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:40.050\nThe idea of drawing a host or VMs on our\nhost out of the running environment and\n\n718\n00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.960\nmoving them into an area where we can work\non them taking them essentially out of\n\n719\n00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.870\nproduction.\n\n720\n00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:48.010\nSo the CCSP has to understand that the use\nof change management, and control windows,\n\n721\n00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:51.970\nis vital to our ability to be able to run\nour infrastructure, because if we just\n\n722\n00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:56.110\nrandomly decide, I'm gonna take down a\nproduction host and all the VMs running on\n\n723\n00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:00.130\nit in order to do work on it I could\nblow up a huge production environment.\n\n724\n00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.960\nSo that would violate my SLAs,\n\n725\n00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.850\nhigh availability is guaranteed based\non the number of 9's for up time.\n\n726\n00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.070\nYou know, 3 9, 4 9, 5 9, up time.\n\n727\n00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.640\nActually really cool kind of question for\nyou here.\n\n728\n00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.100\nSo we'll play a game real quick, right.\n\n729\n00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:17.700\nIf you have 3/9 up time, I've talked about\nthis before and the guarantee that most\n\n730\n00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.100\nmajor hosting providers give you is a 3/9\nup time guarantee to start with and\n\n731\n00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.650\nyou may pay more for that.\n\n732\n00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.750\nAnd I've mentioned once or twice in our\nconversations that Three nine up time\n\n733\n00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.060\nguarantees a certain amount of up time.\n\n734\n00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:27.850\nOr, in other words,\n\n735\n00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.490\nyou could think of it as a certain\namount of down time, either way.\n\n736\n00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.280\nSo, let's think about the down\ntime associated with 39 up time.\n\n737\n00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.160\nWhat's the approximate down\ntime on 39 up time for a year?\n\n738\n00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.130\n>> If I'm remembering correctly I\nthink it's a little over eight hours.\n\n739\n00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:42.310\n>> It's about eight and three quarter\nactually, it's close to nine hours.\n\n740\n00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.390\nOf guaranteed, or\nexcuse me, not guaranteed.\n\n741\n00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:46.580\nBut well, actually, think about it\nthat way, guaranteed down time.\n\n742\n00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.420\nBecause what the vendor does is\nessentially they use those maintenance\n\n743\n00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:51.960\nwindows to be able to interact and\nto do that.\n\n744\n00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.930\nSo yeah, about eight and three-quarters\nhours of down time potentially a year.\n\n745\n00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.530\nThat actually translates into\napproximately ten minutes of down\n\n746\n00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.470\ntime a week.\n\n747\n00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.480\nIf you think about that,\nif you average it out.\n\n748\n00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.040\nWhat about four nine uptime, we often\nhear about four nine uptime as well.\n\n749\n00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:05.660\nWhat do we get there?\n\n750\n00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.210\nDo you have any idea?\n\n751\n00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:07.260\n>> It drops dramatically at four nines.\n\n752\n00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.430\n>> It does drop dramatically.\n\n753\n00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.170\n>> I want to say now it's down to\nthe minutes, probably 13 minutes or\n\n754\n00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:11.870\nsomething like that.\n\n755\n00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:13.860\n>> Not quite 13 minutes,\nit's higher than that.\n\n756\n00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:16.360\nBut it is about 52 minutes, approximately,\n\n757\n00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:20.890\nwhich translates into just over 1 minute\nof downtime per week across the year.\n\n758\n00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:21.870\n>> Wow, that's a whole lot better.\n\n759\n00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:22.770\n>> Right.\n\n760\n00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:25.380\nThe time it took us to figure that out\nessentially you'd be down for this week.\n\n761\n00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.870\nCorrect?\nNow what about fine nine up-time?\n\n762\n00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:30.257\nLet's hear fine nine up-time as well\n>> All right five nine up-time is like\n\n763\n00:37:30.257 --> 00:37:31.180\ninsane.\n\n764\n00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.300\nIt's virtually seconds a day or\nmaybe even less than that.\n\n765\n00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.890\n>> Well, over the course of the day.\n\n766\n00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:39.660\nIt's almost nothing, but\noverall for the course of the year.\n\n767\n00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.010\nThat's approximately five minutes\nof downtime for the year.\n\n768\n00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.785\nWhich equates to roughly about six\nseconds of downtime a week for\n\n769\n00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:47.060\nfive-nine uptime systems.\n\n770\n00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:50.320\nAnd by the way, five-nine uptime\nis not that outrageous today.\n\n771\n00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.150\nI mean, we think about that now and\ngo wow, that's insane, but there\n\n772\n00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:57.190\nare many systems that run on five-nine\nguaranteed SLA systems, five-nine\n\n773\n00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.010\nuptime systems today, we actually go all\nthe way out to seven-nine [INAUDIBLE].\n\n774\n00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:02.280\nBelieve it or not, today we monitor\nit all the way out to seven ninths.\n\n775\n00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.480\n>> You get to guarantee\nof up to seven ninths?\n\n776\n00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.880\n>> In certain systems.\n\n777\n00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.670\nYou know if you think about, 911 systems,\nlike safety systems for instance,\n\n778\n00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.780\nthey essentially can never go offline.\n\n779\n00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:14.230\nIf they do, people die,\nit's just you know It's a real\n\n780\n00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:17.140\npretty straight progression from\na risk manager's perspective, right?\n\n781\n00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.060\nLack of availability equals death.\n\n782\n00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.910\nTherefore, we guarantee up time.\n\n783\n00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:21.760\nSo-\n>> The risk is large.\n\n784\n00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.600\n>> The risk is incredibly large, right?\n\n785\n00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.090\nI mean, it's in the highest\nquadrant of the risk matrix.\n\n786\n00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:31.280\nSo when we talk about 59, 69, 79 systems,\nwe're getting into that territory where\n\n787\n00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:35.240\nwe're building in double, triple,\nquadruple redundant systems.\n\n788\n00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:40.040\nYour 911 systems stay online essentially\nall the time, because it's not one system.\n\n789\n00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:40.840\nIt's three or\n\n790\n00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.540\nfour different concentric rings of\nsystems that are backing each other up.\n\n791\n00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:46.360\nSo that number one, we can do maintenance.\n\n792\n00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:49.810\nNumber two, if we have a catastrophic\nfailure you've got redundancy so\n\n793\n00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.020\nthat those systems just don't go offline.\n\n794\n00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.560\nSo we actually go out that far.\n\n795\n00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.320\nThe reality is when we get to 7 9's,\n\n796\n00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.560\nyou're essentially talking about\nbeing up all the time, right?\n\n797\n00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.220\nI mean its 3 seconds of down time a year,\napproximately,\n\n798\n00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.030\nis what we measure, which equates to\nsomething like 600th of a second a week.\n\n799\n00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.930\nIt's just like crazy, crazy.\n\n800\n00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.560\nLike you could blink and\nthat's your up time.\n\n801\n00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.010\nThat's your down time rather.\n\n802\n00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:12.880\nFor like the week,\nyou just consumed it all right there.\n\n803\n00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:17.610\n>> That's hard to fathom to be honest with\nyou to think about that level of up time.\n\n804\n00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:18.170\n>> It really is.\n\n805\n00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.130\nI mean, think about it, as a human we\ndon't really have a point of reference for\n\n806\n00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.120\nthat kind of time .That's like\nmeasuring in milliseconds you just\n\n807\n00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.890\ndon't what that is, or microsecond\nyou just don't know what that is.\n\n808\n00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.940\nAnyways that's some of the stuff we\nhave to consider and talk about here and\n\n809\n00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:32.340\nthat we've done the math\nportion of our program but\n\n810\n00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:35.490\nit's always fun when I walk people\nthrough that kind of thought process.\n\n811\n00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:38.230\nBecause you don't really think\nabout what uptime means and\n\n812\n00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.250\nthe SLA guarantee means until you look\nat it from the downtime perspective and\n\n813\n00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.820\nsay yeah I'm up most of the time, well\nwhat does that really mean, well I'm down.\n\n814\n00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.040\nBasically, eight and a half hours a year.\n\n815\n00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.300\nWhat does that really equate to?\n\n816\n00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.680\nThat's a lot of up time.\n\n817\n00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.360\nThat's why this CCSPs we have\nto start really thinking about.\n\n818\n00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.820\nAs we think about how to run the physical\ninfrastructure and the infrastructure in\n\n819\n00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.000\ngeneral that we're gonna have to run\nto create the cloud environments.\n\n820\n00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.080\n>> Yep, and you gotta remember once you\nactually put the key in the ignition,\n\n821\n00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.290\nyou turn it, and you hit the gas,\nhopefully all these design mechanisms that\n\n822\n00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:10.280\nwe've talked about in the prior episodes,\nfor security are in place.\n\n823\n00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.515\nAnd that's gonna try to help keep you\nsafe, but you still have to drive the car.\n\n824\n00:40:13.515 --> 00:40:15.435\nYou still have to maneuver\nit down the road and\n\n825\n00:40:15.435 --> 00:40:16.595\nthat's what we're talking about here.\n\n826\n00:40:16.595 --> 00:40:22.295\nIs when it is in operation that you are\nstill conforming to security standards,\n\n827\n00:40:22.295 --> 00:40:23.675\nyou are using your blinkers.\n\n828\n00:40:23.675 --> 00:40:25.155\nYou're looking for your blindspot.\n\n829\n00:40:25.155 --> 00:40:26.185\n>> Wear your seatbelt!\n\n830\n00:40:26.185 --> 00:40:27.350\n>> You're wearing the seatbelt.\n\n831\n00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:30.588\n[CROSSTALK] Putting the security\nfeatures on and using them.\n\n832\n00:40:30.588 --> 00:40:32.367\nWhile the car is in operation or\n\n833\n00:40:32.367 --> 00:40:35.920\nyour infrastructure is actually\nbeing run by yourself.\n\n834\n00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:41.010\nAnd that way, we can reach,\nif ever possible, that level of seven 9s,\n\n835\n00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:45.760\nbut, more commonly, the three, four and\nfive 9s of uptime that we are looking for.\n\n836\n00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.040\nAll right, Adam, with that being said,\n\n837\n00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.260\nlooks like we've come to the end\nof another great episode.\n\n838\n00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.580\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n839\n00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.080\nWe sure thank you for joining us.\n\n840\n00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.710\nBut signing off for ITProTV.\n\n841\n00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.600\nI've been

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.590\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\n\n4\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.370\nin today's episode\n>> Well,\n\n5\n00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.550\nas I knock your laptop off the table.\n\n6\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.040\n>> He's going to knock my laptop over.\n\n7\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.900\nAnd we're going to\ncontinue on looking at our\n\n8\n00:00:27.900 -->

laptop?\n\n11\n00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.100\nYou came close.\n\n12\n00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.810\n>> Did I?\n>> You came close.\n\n13\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.440\nYou came very close.\n\n14\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.120\n>> I was trying to get both.\n\n15\n00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.840\n>> The destroyer of worlds here,\nour good friend Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n16\n00:00:37.840

you,\nI appreciate that wonderful introduction.\n\n19\n00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.600\nSo I'm doing well.\n\n20\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.220\nI apologize about the damage\nto your laptop there.\n\n21\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.390\nYou're gonna have to restrain me from\nbeing able to hit that thing going\n\n22\n00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.910\nforward.\n\n23\n00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.330\nI don't have this problem when\nwe're in the other studio.\n\n24\n00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.293\nI know there's only like\ntwo inches of room.\n\n25\n00:00:57.293 --> 00:00:59.350\n>> We're not even juxtaposed,\nwe're kind of like at more of an angle.\n\n26\n00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.520\n>> But we have so much room here.\n\n27\n00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.080\nI feel like it's okay to be expansive and\nthen I'm expansive.\n\n28\n00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.980\n>> Spread out yeah.\n\n29\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.980\n>> Well you can see in\nthe wide shot what that is.\n\n30\n00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.170\n>> Just raise your hands up and\nyou can expand that way.\n\n31\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.320\n>> This way as opposed to this way but\nit's just so\n\n32\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.980\nmuch more comfortable to go this way.\n\n33\n00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.140\nIf I really did this\nhard it would go fine,\n\n34\n00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.980\nI do have to be careful with that so.\n\n35\n00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.100\nI do apologize I did not mean to do that.\n\n36\n00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.720\nSo we're gonna talk a little bit about\nmanaging physical infrastructure for\n\n37\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.040\nthe Cloud, continue our conversations\nI should say in this area.\n\n38\n00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.240\nWe've had several episodes, prior to this,\n\n39\n00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.780\nwhere we've been talking about physical\ninfrastructure, and planning it out, and\n\n40\n00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.230\nfiguring out how to implement it,\nand ultimately how to architect.\n\n41\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.080\nAnd we wanna just review some of the key\nconcepts with the thought process around\n\n42\n00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.110\nhow to actually manage it, thinking about\nwhat we're gonna do once it's up and\n\n43\n00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.310\nrunning towards the end of this life\ncycle of now operationalizing it and\n\n44\n00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.870\nkeeping track of it to\nensure that we are secure.\n\n45\n00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.780\nKeep in mind we're talking about\ncomputers, we're talking about storage,\n\n46\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.290\nwe're talking about networking,\nwe're talking about facilities,\n\n47\n00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.310\ntalking about all the related\ninfrastructure and\n\n48\n00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.384\nthe component mechanisms\nthat make up the Cloud.\n\n49\n00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:02.450\nWe have to think about virtualization,\nwe have to think about storage,\n\n50\n00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.590\nwe have to think about back up and\nrecovery,\n\n51\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.510\nwe have to think about security\nboth physical and logical.\n\n52\n00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.480\nAll these things are things that we would\nbe considering and be focused on here.\n\n53\n00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.900\nSo when we talk about the Cloud,\n\n54\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.000\nin other words its not just I'm able\nto go there to that web site and\n\n55\n00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.480\nI'm gonna be able to grab that\ninformation as we talked about right.\n\n56\n00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.730\nThere is and API or two that will\nbe given to you by the vendor.\n\n57\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.240\nCan we actually do just something\non the fly here real quick?\n\n58\n00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.610\n>> Sure.\n>> Can you take a look and go to AWS,\n\n59\n00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.060\nthe main site for AWS?\n\n60\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.050\nWe'll give Daniel a second\njust to come up with that.\n\n61\n00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.750\nAnd we wanna see the log on,\nwhere the customer would on board.\n\n62\n00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.220\nSo what the log on, when you click\non log on to log in as a customer,\n\n63\n00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.070\nwhat that will look like.\n\n64\n00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.050\nSo we'll give Daniel just a second to\nfind that and get that up and running.\n\n65\n00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.870\nWhat we're gonna take a look at is,\nif you are an AWS account holder,\n\n66\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.950\nor you're gonna create an account,\nas you can see there.\n\n67\n00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.150\nWhen we say API's, cuz I'm thinking we say\nAPI's all the time, and we define API.\n\n68\n00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.690\nApplication Programmatic Interface,\n\n69\n00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.740\nbut the reality is, when we talk about\nAPI's in the Cloud, you may not realize\n\n70\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.590\nwhat we're really talking about is\nit's essentially a web front end.\n\n71\n00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.540\nIt's a connection that allows you,\nas the customer, and\n\n72\n00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.370\nallows the provider to give\nyou application access.\n\n73\n00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.030\nSo when I use kinda the shorthand for\nthat relationship, or the shorthand for\n\n74\n00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.840\nthat reference, what we're actually\ntalking about is something like this,\n\n75\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.170\na web enabled page, or\nweb enabled service with a front end\n\n76\n00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.720\non a web page that you're\ngonna use as a customer.\n\n77\n00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.420\nWe're not gonna go through\nthe process of signing in here.\n\n78\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.780\nBut the reality is, you could see that,\nthrough this secure portal or\n\n79\n00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.560\nwhatever will be on the other end of this\nportal as you go through the process of\n\n80\n00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.745\ncreating or signing in,\nwe eventually get into the Amazon fabric.\n\n81\n00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:43.720\nAnd we're able to use or\nwith Azure and Microsoft or\n\n82\n00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.510\nthe equivalent on any vendor's platform,\nwe're going to be able to use that API,\n\n83\n00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.550\nthat interface,\nthat programmatic hook to be able to do\n\n84\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.185\nthe things we need to do in managing\ninfrastructure and interact.\n\n85\n00:03:54.185 --> 00:03:55.975\nSo this is when we talk about APIs,\n\n86\n00:03:55.975 --> 00:03:58.935\nthis is essentially what\nwe're really thinking about.\n\n87\n00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:02.945\nWe're thinking about the different\nservice models, SAS, PASS, or IAS, right?\n\n88\n00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:05.875\nThere may be one or more of them that\nwe're going to consume in this particular\n\n89\n00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:07.317\narea depending on what we're doing.\n\n90\n00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:09.707\nAnd remember, we're talking about\nthe four deployment models, right?\n\n91\n00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:11.747\nWe're going to talk about the public\nCloud, the private Cloud,\n\n92\n00:04:11.747 --> 00:04:14.097\nthe hybrid Cloud, and,\nor the community Cloud.\n\n93\n00:04:14.097 --> 00:04:17.467\nWhen we combine them together, this is\ntypically what the front end looks like.\n\n94\n00:04:17.467 --> 00:04:18.287\nAnd you know what's great?\n\n95\n00:04:18.287 --> 00:04:18.942\nI did this.\n\n96\n00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:20.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it disappeared.\n\n97\n00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.390\nThat is awesome.\n\n98\n00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.204\n>> You are in control sir [LAUGH].\n\n99\n00:04:23.204 --> 00:04:25.050\n>> If that was only the case.\n\n100\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.240\nI live for that day.\n\n101\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.830\nIt has not happened yet, but\nit is coming soon, I hope.\n\n102\n00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.850\nSo when we think about all\nthese different models,\n\n103\n00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.540\nall these different ways of doing things.\n\n104\n00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.330\nAnd we talk a lot about APIs.\n\n105\n00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.120\nYou actually get to see it, you get to\nhold it in your hand, you get to touch it.\n\n106\n00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.300\nThat's what we're talking about here.\n\n107\n00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.190\nWe're talking about mixing and\n\n108\n00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.850\nmatching those deployment models,\nthose service models, and those front\n\n109\n00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.320\nend access mechanisms through APIs to be\nable to then actually manage the Cloud.\n\n110\n00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.280\nAnd that may be, by the way,\ntaking the form of a dashboard.\n\n111\n00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.030\nIt may be taking the form of\na lot of different things.\n\n112\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.000\nIf we go,\neven if we do the overhead camera,\n\n113\n00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.780\nyou're not gonna be able to see that.\n\n114\n00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.680\nIt's gonna look all crazy if\nI flatten the screen out.\n\n115\n00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because I was gonna show you\n\n116\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.060\nthe Office 365 portal, and\nshow you what an actual logged on\n\n117\n00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.975\ndashboard KPI management\nsystem looks like.\n\n118\n00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:15.895\n>> I think I do have management\nconnectivity to ours.\n\n119\n00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:17.615\n>> Well we could, we'll figure that out.\n\n120\n00:05:17.615 --> 00:05:18.945\nDon't worry about that for now.\n\n121\n00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:21.075\nWe may set that up as a demo for\nyou later.\n\n122\n00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:24.495\nI was gonna log on to mine, but\nthen I realized you can't see my machine.\n\n123\n00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.195\nSo I actually am logged onto mine, but\n\n124\n00:05:27.195 --> 00:05:30.085\nyou can't see it because I'm staring\nat it even as we speak right now.\n\n125\n00:05:30.085 --> 00:05:32.810\nOr I could be just by\nmoving my window selector.\n\n126\n00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.480\nBut the idea is simply that we'll have\na program, some sort of front end\n\n127\n00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.280\nto do the management and we've probably\nall seen management interfaces before.\n\n128\n00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.300\nThere's nothing radically\ndifferent in that one.\n\n129\n00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.630\nWe have to ensure that\nwe have secure access so\n\n130\n00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.020\nwe have to worry about single,\ndual multi-factor authentication.\n\n131\n00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.800\nWe have to think about securing that\naccess, we have to think about tunneling,\n\n132\n00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.800\nwe have to think about secure protocols,\n\n133\n00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.450\nwe have to think about making sure that\nwe are gonna be using secure end points,\n\n134\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.155\nwe have to do baseline configuration\nmanagement, a continuous monitoring.\n\n135\n00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:04.975\nWe've talked a lot about all these\nconcerns already in many of our\n\n136\n00:06:04.975 --> 00:06:05.745\nprior episodes.\n\n137\n00:06:05.745 --> 00:06:08.635\nI wanna link that knowledge together,\nbring it back here, and\n\n138\n00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:11.732\nensure that we understand that\nencryption should always be applied,\n\n139\n00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:13.442\nshould always monitor connections.\n\n140\n00:06:13.442 --> 00:06:18.002\nWe should always use proper identity\naccess management control so identify,\n\n141\n00:06:18.002 --> 00:06:20.202\nauthenticate, authorize access.\n\n142\n00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:23.482\nWe wanna go through all that, make sure\nwe are logging all of our connections,\n\n143\n00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:26.392\nmaking sure we're keeping track of them so\nwe have auditability,\n\n144\n00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:30.212\nwe have traceability,\nwe have transparency, and essentially,\n\n145\n00:06:30.212 --> 00:06:34.522\nwe have an auditable trail that shows us\nwho did what under what circumstances.\n\n146\n00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:39.740\nSo if Daniel was to log in and was to\nshow us that administrative interface,\n\n147\n00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.350\nI in theory will be able to go in to\nthe back end to look at a log entry,\n\n148\n00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.940\nprobably several, that would show us that\nDaniel logged on at a certain point.\n\n149\n00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.870\nHe had gone to these areas, had clicked\non these particular interfaces,\n\n150\n00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.500\nopened them up, done various things.\n\n151\n00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.660\nWe should have logging that\nwill keep track of that and\n\n152\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.610\nwe should use a SEM solution, security\ninformation event management solution,\n\n153\n00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.690\nto be able to take that information,\ncentrally aggregate and understand it.\n\n154\n00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.270\nControl it, pull it in, and\nmake sure we have the ability to look at.\n\n155\n00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.570\nI know that I had asked you to pull up,\nwe're not going to go to it yet, but\n\n156\n00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.080\nI know I that I had asked you to\npull up a NIS document for me.\n\n157\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.450\n>> Correct.\n>> And we did that one But\n\n158\n00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.150\nthere was one I forgot to ask you\nto mention in regards to logging.\n\n159\n00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.140\nMaybe you could look for\nit quickly while we're talking.\n\n160\n00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.570\nDo the same search we did for a patch\nmanagement but do a log management.\n\n161\n00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.620\nAnd you'll find that we a NIS document or\n\n162\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.790\ntwo cuz there will be several\nthat we can look up, but\n\n163\n00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.220\nyou'll get a reference to one of the ones\nthat would be good for log management.\n\n164\n00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.330\n>> I do guide to computer\nsecurity log management.\n\n165\n00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.580\n>> Outstanding.\nYes do we have that one?\n\n166\n00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.270\n>> Right here.\n>> Okay so there we go look at that.\n\n167\n00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:37.520\n>> And I didn't even have to do this.\n\n168\n00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.780\nAll I did was do that.\n\n169\n00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.870\nAwesome.\n\n170\n00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.880\nIt's like a mythical joystick that's\nwirelessly connected to everything.\n\n171\n00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.940\n>> It's like being-\n>> Almost like the Cloud.\n\n172\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.247\n>> What was that movie\nwith what's-his-name?\n\n173\n00:07:49.247 --> 00:07:51.480\nI could see his face.\n\n174\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.120\nHe was in Risky Business.\n\n175\n00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:53.860\nTom Cruise.\n\n176\n00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.980\nThat's it.\nTom Cruise.\n\n177\n00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.393\nWhat's that, The Minority Report.\n\n178\n00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:57.713\n[CROSSTALK] He was just\ncontrolling everything, yeah.\n\n179\n00:07:57.713 --> 00:07:59.959\n>> Yeah, where they're doing this stuff.\n\n180\n00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.780\nThe savants, or whoever they were,\nwere doing things.\n\n181\n00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.492\nWell, that or I saw last night on TV,\ncuz I had a little time when we got done,\n\n182\n00:08:05.492 --> 00:08:09.218\nLast night, after I did all my homework\ngetting ready to do our stuff today.\n\n183\n00:08:09.218 --> 00:08:12.560\nAnd then I went back to the hotel,\nhad nothing to do for a little bit,\n\n184\n00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.215\ncaught the tail-end of a movie.\n\n185\n00:08:14.215 --> 00:08:19.720\nI think it was, the character,\nMorgan Freeman's in it.\n\n186\n00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:23.235\nLucy is the character's name,\n\n187\n00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:26.010\nthe woman who becomes this\nsuper powerful human being.\n\n188\n00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.890\nShe gets all knowledge and she becomes,\nthere's some sort of drug they give her.\n\n189\n00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.341\n>> Yeah.\n>> She becomes aware of everything.\n\n190\n00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:33.597\nI don't know the name of the movie,\nI just caught the very end of it, so\n\n191\n00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:34.685\nI don't know what it's called.\n\n192\n00:08:34.685 --> 00:08:38.612\nBut I can't remember the name of\nthe woman, the actor who's in it.\n\n193\n00:08:41.887 --> 00:08:43.958\nIt escapes me right now, but anyways,\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n194\n00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.350\n>> He plays a scientist, Morgan Freeman.\n\n195\n00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.321\nShe plays this character who, and again,\nI saw the last 15 minutes of the movie so\n\n196\n00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:53.321\nI really don't know the whole back story,\nbut she had been given some sort of drug.\n\n197\n00:08:53.321 --> 00:08:55.106\nIt's like a blue crystal kind of thing,\n>> Hm.\n\n198\n00:08:55.106 --> 00:08:58.941\n>> That enhances her mental powers,\nand essentially she becomes this on\n\n199\n00:08:58.941 --> 00:09:02.650\nthe present, all knowing,\nall being, all thinking thing.\n\n200\n00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:08.610\nAnd turns into, kind of a nameless,\nfaceless entity at the end of the movie.\n\n201\n00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.270\nShe becomes, she is,\n>> Hm, that's interesting.\n\n202\n00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:11.906\n>> The Matrix, right?\n\n203\n00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:13.451\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, she is the Matrix.\n\n204\n00:09:13.451 --> 00:09:14.996\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so it was kinda a cool movie,\n\n205\n00:09:14.996 --> 00:09:16.260\nI just caught the very end of it.\n\n206\n00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.440\nI'm not sure what it was called, but\nanyway, it was kind of like that.\n\n207\n00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.531\n>> Yeah.\n>> But that’s totally irrelevant to what\n\n208\n00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:20.807\nwe're here to talk about,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:21.590\n>> Cuz nobody probably\n\n210\n00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.380\nknows what I'm talking about.\n\n211\n00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.070\n>> Remember our warning, random asides.\n\n212\n00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.860\nWe've got to put that up.\n\n213\n00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.520\n>> We need that flashing.\n\n214\n00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.395\n>> We need that flashing up.\n\n215\n00:09:26.395 --> 00:09:27.395\n>> We need that flashing, absolutely.\n\n216\n00:09:27.395 --> 00:09:28.011\n>> We'll get our production crew on that.\n\n217\n00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:29.948\n[LAUGH]\n>> We need the flash,\n\n218\n00:09:29.948 --> 00:09:31.440\nthe flash animation in general.\n\n219\n00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.370\n>> Yeah.\n>> To flash that, among many other things,\n\n220\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:34.320\nas we talked about.\n\n221\n00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.410\nBut we'll have that on\nthe Hurricane Pizza truck.\n\n222\n00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:37.320\n>> We will.\nWe will.\n\n223\n00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.410\n>> So we're gonna work on that.\n\n224\n00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.600\nMegan, you're gonna help us with that.\n\n225\n00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.426\nShe's gotta take it out, she’s gonna\nfigure out how to make all that work for\n\n226\n00:09:42.426 --> 00:09:43.300\nus at some point.\n\n227\n00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.234\nAll right, so when we think about cloud\naccess control, environmental access,\n\n228\n00:09:47.234 --> 00:09:49.066\nwe think about access requirements.\n\n229\n00:09:49.066 --> 00:09:50.254\nIt’s all the things we’re talking about,\nright?\n\n230\n00:09:50.254 --> 00:09:52.788\nWe wanna go through,\nremember as CCSPs, and\n\n231\n00:09:52.788 --> 00:09:56.267\nwe wanna make sure that we’re\ntaking our checklist, right?\n\n232\n00:09:56.267 --> 00:09:59.190\nAnd going down the list and\nchecking off all the things we have to do.\n\n233\n00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:02.508\nLogging is important, so we have\nthe NIST logging document there, right?\n\n234\n00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:05.590\n[LAUGH] We had it up, we weren’t even\ntalking about, totally forgot about it.\n\n235\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.775\nSo you’ll again, keep in mind this\nis not necessarily something, and\n\n236\n00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:12.040\nI always wanna stress this\nwhen we put these things up.\n\n237\n00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.210\nWe try to bring these documents in,\ntry to bring in the websites and\n\n238\n00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:18.160\nthe ISO standards, all the things\nthat you would wanna know about,\n\n239\n00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.470\nthat would be helpful to\nyou in the real world.\n\n240\n00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.010\nThose practical points of reference,\npractical points of knowledge,\n\n241\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.880\nessentially building that tool kit, right,\nfor a security administrator in the cloud.\n\n242\n00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.650\nThese are great things for you to look at,\nat some point after the exam.\n\n243\n00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:36.245\nNobody's expecting you to read this 50 or\n100 page document, whatever it is from\n\n244\n00:10:36.245 --> 00:10:40.220\nNIST, and to actually put into play\non the exam all the knowledge here.\n\n245\n00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.910\nBut we are making you aware of the fact\nthat there is guidance out there.\n\n246\n00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.740\nBest practices, recommendations,\nguidelines that will be incredibly\n\n247\n00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.630\nhelpful for you to be able to figure out\nhow to do this stuff, especially if you're\n\n248\n00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.582\nnewer to this role, this may not\nbe something you've done before.\n\n249\n00:10:54.582 --> 00:10:56.410\nA lot of us have done IT for many years,\n\n250\n00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.040\nbut may never have really formally\nthought about log management.\n\n251\n00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.540\nIt just may not be something you focus on.\n\n252\n00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.730\nOr patch management, right, or\nany of the other things we talk about.\n\n253\n00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.680\nAnd getting guidance and\nhaving somebody who’s done it, or\n\n254\n00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.750\na group of somebodies in this case, right,\nwho are knowledgable, who have done it.\n\n255\n00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.208\nAnd say, hey, these are the five or ten\ntop things that you gotta think about and\n\n256\n00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:15.287\nthe way you gotta do them,\ncan be very helpful.\n\n257\n00:11:15.287 --> 00:11:19.766\nI know when I was starting out many,\nmany moons ago, in this case over\n\n258\n00:11:19.766 --> 00:11:24.416\n30 years now in my career doing IT,\na lot of this stuff didn't exist.\n\n259\n00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:28.179\nI mean in theory, yeah, we had to do log\nmanagement, but nobody had written a 20,\n\n260\n00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:30.575\n30, 40,\n50 page guide on the best way to do it.\n\n261\n00:11:30.575 --> 00:11:32.431\nNobody had thought about it,\nit was so new.\n\n262\n00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:37.110\nAnd so you really had to figure out a lot\nof this stuff and come to it on your own.\n\n263\n00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.700\nToday, thankfully that's\nnot always the case.\n\n264\n00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.650\nAnd I remember those days of struggling\nto figure out how to write up a security\n\n265\n00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.780\nreport, what an incident response template\nwould look like, what is was to create\n\n266\n00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.070\na baseline and what that really meant,\nand not everybody could tell you.\n\n267\n00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:54.920\nAnd you would ask questions,\nand people just wouldn't know.\n\n268\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.660\nAnd you couldn't necessarily\njust go out to the web and\n\n269\n00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.580\nGoogle the way you do today for\neverything.\n\n270\n00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.520\nThere was a web, and you had information,\nyou had search engines,\n\n271\n00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.190\nbut reality was, there just wasn't\nthat much stuff out there, right?\n\n272\n00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.910\nThe web is so pervasive today,\nit's literally, world-spanning.\n\n273\n00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:14.300\nBut today, it's very different than\nit was 10, even 15, even 5 years ago.\n\n274\n00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.570\nThe volume of information\ngrowth is just astronomical.\n\n275\n00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.030\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n276\n00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.990\nwe need to understand that\nwe've made things very easy,\n\n277\n00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.870\nrelatively speaking, right, for a lot of\npeople today to find this information.\n\n278\n00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:28.570\nSo we try to share that with you and make\nsure that you understand those things.\n\n279\n00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.360\nSo this is a good guide,\nthis is one to look at.\n\n280\n00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.487\nWe have the patch management one as well.\n\n281\n00:12:31.487 --> 00:12:32.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We might as well throw that\n\n282\n00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.370\nup while we're here real quick, right?\n\n283\n00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.776\nSo we also have the Creating a Patch and\nVulnerability Management Program guide.\n\n284\n00:12:36.776 --> 00:12:40.032\nYou can see that one here, another NIST\ndocument that would be very valuable for\n\n285\n00:12:40.032 --> 00:12:40.821\nyou to be aware of.\n\n286\n00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:44.432\nSo we want to think about the fact\nthat creating secure baselines,\n\n287\n00:12:44.432 --> 00:12:47.976\ndoing patch management,\ndoing log management, are all gonna be\n\n288\n00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:52.175\nimportant things that we want to,\nneed to, as CCSPs be involved with.\n\n289\n00:12:52.175 --> 00:12:57.157\nNeed to push, need to ensure is happening,\nneed to standardize through policy,\n\n290\n00:12:57.157 --> 00:12:59.807\nprocess and procedure,\nand need to audit and\n\n291\n00:12:59.807 --> 00:13:03.707\nensure, not just that it's happening,\nbut that it's happening continuously and\n\n292\n00:13:03.707 --> 00:13:06.847\nthat it is happening based on\nthe standardized approach, that we and\n\n293\n00:13:06.847 --> 00:13:10.327\nthe organization have decided would be the\nmost appropriate way to deal with this.\n\n294\n00:13:10.327 --> 00:13:12.827\nPatch management is vital to our\nability to be able to do this.\n\n295\n00:13:12.827 --> 00:13:15.611\nBut here's something interesting\nwith patch management, right?\n\n296\n00:13:15.611 --> 00:13:18.302\nYou'll actually find this\nconversation in the document.\n\n297\n00:13:18.302 --> 00:13:20.210\nWe don't have to go back to it,\nwe're not gonna reference it.\n\n298\n00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.510\nBut I'm just pointing out what I'm about\nto walk through with you with Daniel here\n\n299\n00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.290\nin a second, is actually discussed\nin that document we just looked at.\n\n300\n00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.750\nYou can read up on it there,\nif you need to figure this out.\n\n301\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.530\nSo Daniel, preference,\ntime to play the preference game.\n\n302\n00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.710\nWhen we think about patch management,\nright?\n\n303\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.510\nDo we think about having a preference for\nautomated versus manual?\n\n304\n00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.900\n>> Maybe, I would definitely prefer\nautomated over manual any day of the week.\n\n305\n00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:42.470\n>> Okay, so why?\n\n306\n00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.948\nWhat would be the, kind of in your mind,\nwhat are the driving characteristics or\n\n307\n00:13:45.948 --> 00:13:48.519\nthe requirements that make\nautomated better than manual?\n\n308\n00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:50.685\n>> Just the administrative\nside of it alone.\n\n309\n00:13:50.685 --> 00:13:53.469\nJust having to go through every\npiece of software that we have, and\n\n310\n00:13:53.469 --> 00:13:55.072\nmaking sure that it is being updated.\n\n311\n00:13:55.072 --> 00:13:59.555\nFor me to create that list, go through it,\nsee what machines have it, what don’t, and\n\n312\n00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:03.675\nthen categorize those out and then make\nsure that, is the latest patch out, when\n\n313\n00:14:03.675 --> 00:14:07.947\nis that coming out, do I have it, have I\ndownloaded it, now is it getting applied?\n\n314\n00:14:07.947 --> 00:14:11.431\nIf I have pushed it out,\nis it actually hitting the machines and\n\n315\n00:14:11.431 --> 00:14:12.830\ngetting applied there?\n\n316\n00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.990\nIt's just a lot of administrative work.\n\n317\n00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:16.830\n>> Okay, so it's gonna make life easer.\n\n318\n00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.430\n>> Yes, my, by far.\n\n319\n00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.892\n>> Certainly it’s gonna cut down on, so\nyou've got more time to do other things,\n\n320\n00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:21.750\nhopefully, that are gonna be\nequally important, right?\n\n321\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:23.215\n>> YouTube's not going to watch itself.\n\n322\n00:14:23.215 --> 00:14:25.820\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, so you've got to keep up on that,\n\n323\n00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.390\ncertainly it's very important.\n\n324\n00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.620\nThe latest downloads and streams for\n\n325\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.470\nSpotify, and or Pandora, you've got\nto get that because that's important.\n\n326\n00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:35.700\nI know, my wife, for\ninstance, every Friday,\n\n327\n00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:37.940\nshe gets a free book download on\nwhatever book service she uses.\n\n328\n00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.110\nShe gotta jump on that.\n\n329\n00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.820\nShe gets her free spin on whatever\nthat video game is she plays on her\n\n330\n00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.652\nphone all the time.\n\n331\n00:14:43.652 --> 00:14:45.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The Bejeweled Blitz or\n\n332\n00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.455\nwhatever the hell it is.\n\n333\n00:14:46.455 --> 00:14:47.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So she's always telling me,\n\n334\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.372\nit's time for my free spin,\nand she's gotta go do that.\n\n335\n00:14:49.372 --> 00:14:51.432\nSo I get there's a lot of things,\nright, that you may do with that time.\n\n336\n00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:52.800\n>> [LAUGH] That’s right.\n>> Hopefully you're putting\n\n337\n00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.329\nit to better use than what\nDaniel's talking about.\n\n338\n00:14:55.329 --> 00:14:57.031\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in general right,\n\n339\n00:14:57.031 --> 00:14:59.683\nyou may be now throwing some of that\ntime into log management, right?\n\n340\n00:14:59.683 --> 00:15:00.731\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that log review,\n\n341\n00:15:00.731 --> 00:15:01.750\nit’s gonna be important.\n\n342\n00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.564\nSo definitely, automated makes sense.\n\n343\n00:15:03.564 --> 00:15:06.060\nBut one of the key things and\nyou hit on all these major points,\n\n344\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.519\nI just wanna draw back out and\nreally focus on it for a minute.\n\n345\n00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:10.665\nAside from the time-saving, certainly,\n\n346\n00:15:10.665 --> 00:15:13.449\nand removing the human from\nthe mix to cut down on errors,\n\n347\n00:15:13.449 --> 00:15:16.929\nwhich you also talked about,\nis the idea of standardization, right?\n\n348\n00:15:16.929 --> 00:15:19.185\nSo that we're gonna get that consistency.\n\n349\n00:15:19.185 --> 00:15:20.655\nIs it hitting all the machines?\n\n350\n00:15:20.655 --> 00:15:21.665\nIs it applied the same way?\n\n351\n00:15:21.665 --> 00:15:23.488\nYou may reference that,\nvery, very important.\n\n352\n00:15:23.488 --> 00:15:27.990\nAnd also the fact that we can schedule and\nreally control the timing.\n\n353\n00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.891\nAnd this is one of the things we\ngotta think about with the cloud,\n\n354\n00:15:30.891 --> 00:15:34.227\nbecause remember, cloud infrastructure\nis gonna be scattered around in\n\n355\n00:15:34.227 --> 00:15:36.835\nmultiple places and\nmay not all be in one place.\n\n356\n00:15:36.835 --> 00:15:41.150\nAnd if we have to do patch management to\nmultiple VMs across different time zones,\n\n357\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.028\nthis now becomes critical, because\nsynchronizing humans to do that work\n\n358\n00:15:45.028 --> 00:15:49.047\nin real time, can be very problematic and\nmost likely is not gonna end well.\n\n359\n00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:53.156\nBut if we can automate the process,\nschedule it, control it, localize it and\n\n360\n00:15:53.156 --> 00:15:56.770\nthen time-synchronize it to 2AM\nin the morning local everywhere,\n\n361\n00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:01.256\nwe're gonna be able to roll that patch out\nconsistently across our infrastructure,\n\n362\n00:16:01.256 --> 00:16:02.778\nregardless of where we are.\n\n363\n00:16:02.778 --> 00:16:06.001\nBoth as a cloud service\nprovider as a customer,\n\n364\n00:16:06.001 --> 00:16:10.112\nas a cloud security professional,\nas an IT administrator,\n\n365\n00:16:10.112 --> 00:16:14.567\nas any role right in that whole\nentire matrix we're discussing.\n\n366\n00:16:14.567 --> 00:16:18.729\nAny and all of us benefit from that\nability, because we need to in some cases\n\n367\n00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:22.848\nhave the ability to standardize and\nto localize the application of work.\n\n368\n00:16:22.848 --> 00:16:26.828\nPatching knowledge, whatever it may\nbe across geographically distinct.\n\n369\n00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:29.428\nAnd as a result,\ntime zone distinct infrastructure.\n\n370\n00:16:29.428 --> 00:16:31.208\nIt's very, very important for\nus to consider.\n\n371\n00:16:31.208 --> 00:16:32.337\nSo thinking about that,\n\n372\n00:16:32.337 --> 00:16:35.518\nstandardizing the communication\nwith regards to patch management.\n\n373\n00:16:35.518 --> 00:16:38.189\nStandardizing the testing,\nthe interoperability,\n\n374\n00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:40.168\nbackwards compatibility components.\n\n375\n00:16:40.168 --> 00:16:41.818\nThe vetting if you will of the patches.\n\n376\n00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:43.998\nFigure out what should and\nshould not be applied.\n\n377\n00:16:43.998 --> 00:16:47.358\nAll this is gonna be a benefit to\nus with regards to automation, but\n\n378\n00:16:47.358 --> 00:16:49.222\nwe always have a need for oversight.\n\n379\n00:16:49.222 --> 00:16:53.846\nWe wanna ensure and keep in mind, and\nI'm sure what Daniel would say, and\n\n380\n00:16:53.846 --> 00:16:56.098\nwould admit to this if we asked him.\n\n381\n00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:57.638\nWe're not going to, but if he did.\n\n382\n00:16:57.638 --> 00:17:00.872\nHe would agree with me,\nI'm sure that even with all that,\n\n383\n00:17:00.872 --> 00:17:02.668\nwe still need a human in the mix.\n\n384\n00:17:02.668 --> 00:17:06.916\nWe still need some sort of oversight not\nthat you can't do oversight automatically,\n\n385\n00:17:06.916 --> 00:17:07.506\ncuz again,\n\n386\n00:17:07.506 --> 00:17:11.228\nyou would in Daniel's world have\na record of those patches being applied.\n\n387\n00:17:11.228 --> 00:17:14.338\nYou'd have some sort of patch management\nsystem, you could do reporting.\n\n388\n00:17:14.338 --> 00:17:17.116\nYou could see the deltas where\nyou did apply, did not apply,\n\n389\n00:17:17.116 --> 00:17:18.928\nthe gaps, that would all be apparent.\n\n390\n00:17:18.928 --> 00:17:21.743\nWe could automate all that, but\nsomebody's gotta review that,\n\n391\n00:17:21.743 --> 00:17:23.188\nultimately at the end of the day.\n\n392\n00:17:23.188 --> 00:17:26.969\nSo we still need human beings,\nwe still need a manual component or\n\n393\n00:17:26.969 --> 00:17:28.978\na person component to the system.\n\n394\n00:17:28.978 --> 00:17:32.133\nBut we may not need a person\nbased component pushing buttons,\n\n395\n00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:34.379\npulling levers and deploying patches, but\n\n396\n00:17:34.379 --> 00:17:37.488\nwe need that oversight at some\nlevel higher up in the system.\n\n397\n00:17:37.488 --> 00:17:39.688\nThat's where the CCSP comes back in.\n\n398\n00:17:39.688 --> 00:17:41.088\nWe may not be the person.\n\n399\n00:17:41.088 --> 00:17:45.400\nAnd ultimately, probably are not going to\nbe the person that will push the patches\n\n400\n00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.399\nout, but we may certainly be and hopefully\nwill be in a well thought-out and\n\n401\n00:17:49.399 --> 00:17:51.168\nwell-designed architecture.\n\n402\n00:17:51.168 --> 00:17:54.562\nThe oversight role that ensures\nthat patching is being done,\n\n403\n00:17:54.562 --> 00:17:56.268\nthat ensures the compliance.\n\n404\n00:17:56.268 --> 00:17:57.589\nEnsures the governance.\n\n405\n00:17:57.589 --> 00:18:00.288\nEnsures that if there is a problem,\nif we miss a machine.\n\n406\n00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:03.068\nWe flag that and we go out and\nfollowup and we figure out why.\n\n407\n00:18:03.068 --> 00:18:07.265\nThat oversight role is exactly the sweet\nspot where the CCSP should be thinking\n\n408\n00:18:07.265 --> 00:18:11.270\nabout sitting and we should be looking\nat that kind of thought process, and\n\n409\n00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.068\nunderstanding it for what it is.\n\n410\n00:18:13.068 --> 00:18:17.568\nRemember, multiple time zones, clearly a\nchallenge, not just for patch management,\n\n411\n00:18:17.568 --> 00:18:21.348\nbut for anything with regards to\nthe virtualization environments we use in\n\n412\n00:18:21.348 --> 00:18:21.948\nthe cloud.\n\n413\n00:18:21.948 --> 00:18:25.328\nAlso, what about virtual machines that\nare running but have been snapshot or\n\n414\n00:18:25.328 --> 00:18:26.318\nhave been suspended?\n\n415\n00:18:26.318 --> 00:18:30.258\nAgain, in the cloud, patch management\nin these situations can be difficult.\n\n416\n00:18:30.258 --> 00:18:32.978\nWe can patch manage\ntemplates that are offline.\n\n417\n00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:34.428\nWe can patch manage machines,\n\n418\n00:18:34.428 --> 00:18:37.678\nbut we may have to do so in a different\nway, use a different approach.\n\n419\n00:18:37.678 --> 00:18:41.498\nMaybe side loading, slip streaming.\n\n420\n00:18:41.498 --> 00:18:43.876\nIt's called different things\nhas different names for it.\n\n421\n00:18:43.876 --> 00:18:47.869\nBut ultimately, if we have a bunch of\nvirtualized infrastructure running and\n\n422\n00:18:47.869 --> 00:18:51.508\nsome of those VMs are going to be\nsuspended, essentially just paused.\n\n423\n00:18:51.508 --> 00:18:55.248\nLiterally, you think about watching\na movie and hitting the pause button.\n\n424\n00:18:55.248 --> 00:18:57.108\nThat's what a suspended VM is.\n\n425\n00:18:57.108 --> 00:18:59.628\nIt's technically not off, but it's not on.\n\n426\n00:18:59.628 --> 00:19:01.728\nBecause in theory, it is powered up right.\n\n427\n00:19:01.728 --> 00:19:03.668\nIt is there, but it's frozen essentially.\n\n428\n00:19:03.668 --> 00:19:05.808\nSo, it's kind of this in between thing.\n\n429\n00:19:05.808 --> 00:19:08.605\nIf we snapshot and\nwe have multiple instances of the VM and\n\n430\n00:19:08.605 --> 00:19:11.418\nthe memory states of that VM\nat different points in time.\n\n431\n00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:14.968\nIf we patch manage the wrong instance,\nwe're not applying the patch to every\n\n432\n00:19:14.968 --> 00:19:17.438\ninstance that's running or\nessentially could run.\n\n433\n00:19:17.438 --> 00:19:21.181\nAnd that could cause an imbalance and\nan insecure environment where we'd revert,\n\n434\n00:19:21.181 --> 00:19:22.528\nwhich is the language we use.\n\n435\n00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:26.403\nWe revert back to a prior instance\nthat may not be patched and\n\n436\n00:19:26.403 --> 00:19:28.738\nthen could be running insecurely.\n\n437\n00:19:28.738 --> 00:19:31.118\nSo, these could be challenges for\npatch management.\n\n438\n00:19:31.118 --> 00:19:34.318\nMultiple time zones also a big problem and\na concern.\n\n439\n00:19:34.318 --> 00:19:38.082\nWe have to think about all these things\nand suspending snapshotting is gonna be\n\n440\n00:19:38.082 --> 00:19:41.389\nsomething that would have to be\nmanaged and be dealt with as well, and\n\n441\n00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:44.428\nthe CCSP may have to contend with,\nand deal with these issues.\n\n442\n00:19:44.428 --> 00:19:45.808\nWhat about performance monitoring?\n\n443\n00:19:45.808 --> 00:19:48.208\nAlso, kind of a highly specialized area.\n\n444\n00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:53.218\nThe CCSP ourselves, we may not really\nget into performance monitoring.\n\n445\n00:19:53.218 --> 00:19:57.048\nBut we do need to understand that the key\nsubsystems, the areas that we've talked\n\n446\n00:19:57.048 --> 00:20:00.448\na lot about these that we monitor would\nbe memory in no particular order.\n\n447\n00:20:00.448 --> 00:20:03.248\nMemory CPU, storage and networking.\n\n448\n00:20:03.248 --> 00:20:06.288\nWe have to keep track of all four\nof those, understand what they are.\n\n449\n00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:10.050\nThey are the fab four as they are often\nreferred to or the fabulous four,\n\n450\n00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.258\nthe four food groups of virtualization.\n\n451\n00:20:12.258 --> 00:20:14.138\nAnd of the cloud,\nwe have to consider those.\n\n452\n00:20:14.138 --> 00:20:16.668\nUnderstand those and\nalways be using do care, and\n\n453\n00:20:16.668 --> 00:20:20.050\ndo diligence to figure\nout how to monitor them.\n\n454\n00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:23.938\nWe talked in the prior episode about\nthings like using shares, reservations and\n\n455\n00:20:23.938 --> 00:20:27.558\nlimits to control through resource\npooling and through authentication.\n\n456\n00:20:27.558 --> 00:20:31.527\nHow to give out those resources and\nmonitor and maintaining access to them,\n\n457\n00:20:31.527 --> 00:20:33.458\nbut it's not just those resources.\n\n458\n00:20:33.458 --> 00:20:35.001\nIt's the hardware they run on,\n\n459\n00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:38.898\nas well as the virtualized instances of\nthose resources that we have to monitor.\n\n460\n00:20:38.898 --> 00:20:42.910\nSo it's the host-based, actual physical\nresources and then the abstracted\n\n461\n00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.058\nthrough hypervisor layer of resources\nthat are given to each virtual instance.\n\n462\n00:20:47.058 --> 00:20:51.089\nWe have to understand and secure and\nmonitor both areas or at least ultimately,\n\n463\n00:20:51.089 --> 00:20:53.208\nas a cloud professional be aware of that.\n\n464\n00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:55.518\nRedundancy is also very important here.\n\n465\n00:20:55.518 --> 00:20:58.584\nWe've talked a lot about the values\nof redundant system architecture and\n\n466\n00:20:58.584 --> 00:21:01.018\nunderstanding the nature,\nand the value of redundancy.\n\n467\n00:21:01.018 --> 00:21:04.218\nIt's also gonna be critical to\nour ability to be successful.\n\n468\n00:21:04.218 --> 00:21:09.028\nWhen we think about redundancy, we're\noften thinking about building second,\n\n469\n00:21:09.028 --> 00:21:12.998\nthird, fourth here and\ndeep system to accept and absorb failure.\n\n470\n00:21:12.998 --> 00:21:16.638\nSo, UPSs right uninterruptible\npower supplies.\n\n471\n00:21:16.638 --> 00:21:19.878\nNIC teams, so we have multiple\nnetwork cards in case one fails.\n\n472\n00:21:19.878 --> 00:21:23.223\nRedundant hard drives, so we have\na secondary hard drive that's mirrored.\n\n473\n00:21:23.223 --> 00:21:25.935\nSo a RAID 1 solution, for instance.\n\n474\n00:21:25.935 --> 00:21:30.335\nWe may have the ability to be able to\nhave an active-active or active-passive\n\n475\n00:21:30.335 --> 00:21:34.935\ncluster and fail over either in real-time,\nor with a little bit of a delay.\n\n476\n00:21:34.935 --> 00:21:38.470\nWe may be using these kinds of\ntechnologies to be able to provide high\n\n477\n00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.379\navailability and, or ultimately fall\ntolerant capabilities with zero or\n\n478\n00:21:42.379 --> 00:21:44.688\nsome small amount of downtime acceptable.\n\n479\n00:21:44.688 --> 00:21:45.788\nRemember, it several times.\n\n480\n00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:50.078\nWe talked about it in the find feed\nwith RPO, recover point objective, RTO,\n\n481\n00:21:50.078 --> 00:21:53.908\nrecovery time objective and MTD,\nmaximum tolerable downtime are.\n\n482\n00:21:53.908 --> 00:21:57.528\nYou do need to understand them in\nthe context of a conversation like this.\n\n483\n00:21:57.528 --> 00:22:00.020\nWe also need to pay attention to.\n\n484\n00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:03.767\nWe need to work with and we need to\nunderstand what vendors are recommending\n\n485\n00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:07.989\nabout their infrastructure, and how they\nsee their infrastructure operating both\n\n486\n00:22:07.989 --> 00:22:09.908\nin the cloud and outside of the cloud.\n\n487\n00:22:09.908 --> 00:22:14.836\nA lot of times we, as IT professionals,\nas security professionals, as people\n\n488\n00:22:14.836 --> 00:22:20.438\nregardless role, regardless of function in\nour industry, in the technology industry.\n\n489\n00:22:20.438 --> 00:22:24.003\nWe often when we get to a certain point\nthink that we have all the answers and\n\n490\n00:22:24.003 --> 00:22:26.778\nwe know better, and\nyou probably know people like this.\n\n491\n00:22:26.778 --> 00:22:30.588\nI'm certainly familiar with people\nlike this, I see them in my customers.\n\n492\n00:22:30.588 --> 00:22:34.510\nI see it in students I talk to sometimes\nthat come through classes where they've\n\n493\n00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.968\nbeen doing it so\nlong that they just feel rightly or\n\n494\n00:22:36.968 --> 00:22:40.848\nwrongly, that they have all the answers\nand they know better than the vendor.\n\n495\n00:22:40.848 --> 00:22:43.057\nThey know better than their peers and\ncolleagues and\n\n496\n00:22:43.057 --> 00:22:45.578\nthey're going to do it their way,\ncuz they figured it out.\n\n497\n00:22:45.578 --> 00:22:47.158\nAnd they may very well be right,\nby the way.\n\n498\n00:22:47.158 --> 00:22:48.919\nBut in many cases they may not be.\n\n499\n00:22:48.919 --> 00:22:52.340\nAnd one of the things I've come to\nunderstand and know over the many years\n\n500\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:55.537\nI've been doing this is that if I\nbuild it myself from the ground up,\n\n501\n00:22:55.537 --> 00:22:58.453\nI'm pretty confident I have a good\nsense of what that means and\n\n502\n00:22:58.453 --> 00:23:01.398\nI know how to manage and\nmaintain something, cuz it's mine.\n\n503\n00:23:01.398 --> 00:23:04.517\nWhen I want a really good meal,\nI go home and I cook it myself or\n\n504\n00:23:04.517 --> 00:23:08.258\nI have somebody I trust cook it,\ncuz it's gonna be made the way I want it.\n\n505\n00:23:08.258 --> 00:23:11.692\nWhen I want something that's gonna\nbe exactly the way I want it,\n\n506\n00:23:11.692 --> 00:23:13.738\nI'm gonna do it and take it on myself.\n\n507\n00:23:13.738 --> 00:23:18.007\nBut if I don't do that or if I'm not that\nexpert, if I'm not making storage arrays,\n\n508\n00:23:18.007 --> 00:23:20.488\nI should not be the first\nperson to raise my hand.\n\n509\n00:23:20.488 --> 00:23:24.225\nAnd say, I have a better way than\nthe people who manufacture that,\n\n510\n00:23:24.225 --> 00:23:28.118\nbecause chances are good they're\ngonna know more about it than I do.\n\n511\n00:23:28.118 --> 00:23:32.679\nI'm smart enough to know that I don't\nknow too much about how to build storage\n\n512\n00:23:32.679 --> 00:23:33.248\narrays.\n\n513\n00:23:33.248 --> 00:23:34.368\nI know how to manage them.\n\n514\n00:23:34.368 --> 00:23:36.770\nI know how to set up, I don't build.\n\n515\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:40.340\nI'm not working for EMC, I don't know how\nto put all that stuff together and create\n\n516\n00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.758\na million dollars worth of hardware and\nput it in a box and ship it that's not me.\n\n517\n00:23:43.758 --> 00:23:47.738\nSo when the vendor says, install it\nthis way, I'm gonna pay attention.\n\n518\n00:23:47.738 --> 00:23:51.785\nI may change that given the parameters of\nwhat I do, but unless there's a compelling\n\n519\n00:23:51.785 --> 00:23:55.661\nreason to the contrary, I'm gonna start\nout from the assumption that, that may\n\n520\n00:23:55.661 --> 00:23:59.043\nvery well be a good place to start and\nthen I may wanna modify over time.\n\n521\n00:23:59.043 --> 00:24:03.114\nRemember, we've talked a lot about the\nidea that the cloud, really the secret to\n\n522\n00:24:03.114 --> 00:24:06.906\ncloud is that one size fits one, not one\nsize fits all that we can customize.\n\n523\n00:24:06.906 --> 00:24:08.386\nWe can tailor or we can scope.\n\n524\n00:24:08.386 --> 00:24:12.699\nThe needs of the organization to\nthe abilities of the cloud to come with\n\n525\n00:24:12.699 --> 00:24:17.232\na uniquely instantiated solution,\na thought process that works for us,\n\n526\n00:24:17.232 --> 00:24:20.240\nvendors play a very important part that.\n\n527\n00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.780\nA lot of vendors,\nearly on, the last three,\n\n528\n00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.890\nfour year will tell you this\napplication doesn't run well.\n\n529\n00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:26.830\nDon't virtualize it.\n\n530\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:27.570\nWe're not supporting it.\n\n531\n00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:28.740\nNow all of a sudden we are.\n\n532\n00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.890\nWe figured it out, right, so\nyou can virtualize exchange now.\n\n533\n00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.310\nYou can virtualize seeklee,\nyou can virtualize SharePoint.\n\n534\n00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:36.510\nFive, six years ago you\ncould have done that, but\n\n535\n00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.070\nit would have been a lot harder for\nyou to figure out how to do it well,\n\n536\n00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.960\nbecause the vendor may not have said yeah,\nwe support it.\n\n537\n00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.970\nBut now we do.\n\n538\n00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:46.580\nSo, it's just one example of the fact\nthat you really have to understand\n\n539\n00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.440\nyour limitations, we've talked a lot\nabout this, and no one to ask for help.\n\n540\n00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.650\nAnd sometimes know that\nthere may not be help.\n\n541\n00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.440\nYou may decide that you're\ngonna go out on your own.\n\n542\n00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.600\nYou're gonna take off the wall application\nthat has never been run virtualized\n\n543\n00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.680\nbefore, and you're gonna be the first\nkid on your block to figure it out.\n\n544\n00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.420\nAnd if you wanna do that that's cool but\n\n545\n00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:08.120\nunderstand that that may be something\nthat is going to be very difficult to do.\n\n546\n00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.930\nAnd you have to be prepared for that and\n\n547\n00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:13.300\nunderstand that that can lead\nto an insecure environment.\n\n548\n00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.410\nAnd as CCSPs, we have to be smart enough\nthat if we're going to go down that road\n\n549\n00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.100\nwe may wanna do that in a separate,\n\n550\n00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.790\nisolated, sandboxed or\nfirewalled off area of our network.\n\n551\n00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.950\nSo create another virtual network.\n\n552\n00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.060\nPut the little playground you want\nto create over there, right and\n\n553\n00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.530\ndo your testing, do QA,\ndo staging, do all that.\n\n554\n00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.540\nIt's very important, but do it there,\ndon't do it in production.\n\n555\n00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.490\nYou know it's about common\nsense in other words.\n\n556\n00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.090\nRight, and if we are common sense\noriented as security professionals,\n\n557\n00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.450\nwe go a lot further.\n\n558\n00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:44.030\nOur networks are more secure, and\n\n559\n00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.810\nwe spend a lot less time chasing\nthe bad guys inside the network.\n\n560\n00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.910\nAnd a lot more time focusing on making\nsure we keep them outside the network\n\n561\n00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:54.500\nbecause we don't do stupid things that\nultimately open the door on purpose\n\n562\n00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.040\nto allow them in.\n\n563\n00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:55.870\nRight?\nIt's very,\n\n564\n00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:57.260\nvery important to think about that.\n\n565\n00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.260\nWhat about backing up and\nrestoring of the host configuration?\n\n566\n00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.525\nHow important is backing up?\n\n567\n00:26:02.525 --> 00:26:05.600\n>> Backup is an essential portion of IT.\n\n568\n00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.710\nI mean we do backups all the time.\n\n569\n00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:08.380\n>> We do.\n\n570\n00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.430\nOkay, why?\n\n571\n00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.110\n>> Because if things go wrong,\n\n572\n00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:17.670\nif, if your data center all of a sudden is\nlike you said before, a smoldering wick,\n\n573\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.120\nin the middle of a parking lot somewhere,\n>> Have I said that?\n\n574\n00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.660\n>> Well, something to that effect,\n\n575\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.510\nsomething like that\n>> You know, what do you do?\n\n576\n00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:28.950\nAre you now a non-entity or do you have\nthe capability built in to say, well,\n\n577\n00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:34.222\nI can restore from my backups and\nbecome, regain that business continuity.\n\n578\n00:26:34.222 --> 00:26:35.610\n>> Sure, so that's very important.\n\n579\n00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:38.071\nSo, what kind of backups\nwould we normally be doing?\n\n580\n00:26:38.071 --> 00:26:39.300\n>> Well, normally, I guess,\n\n581\n00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.640\na lot of people still take tape backups,\nthe snapshots are a type of a backup but\n\n582\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.416\nnot\n>> A back up per se, what else did we do?\n\n583\n00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:49.168\n[CROSSTALK] Is very common.\n\n584\n00:26:49.168 --> 00:26:51.280\n>> Or just back up the drive, or whatever.\n\n585\n00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.950\n>> Right.\n>> But when I think about types,\n\n586\n00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.542\nwhen I'm thinking more about,\nis it a full back up all the time,\n\n587\n00:26:55.542 --> 00:26:56.847\n[CROSSTALK] is it differential?\n\n588\n00:26:56.847 --> 00:26:57.670\n>> Right.\n>> Right\n\n589\n00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.390\nwe have those kind of backup types.\n\n590\n00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:01.710\nIf we do a full, do we do a full everyday?\n\n591\n00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:04.280\nDo we do a full plus differentials?\n\n592\n00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.280\n>> Four plus incrementals,\nwe want to understand those bed rock,\n\n593\n00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.820\nthose base line assumptions about\nbacking up again, because remember,\n\n594\n00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.750\nwe're not as focused on the technology.\n\n595\n00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.790\nWe're not gonna ask you, hey, is it good\nto back up the tape as a CCSP on the exam,\n\n596\n00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:22.690\nbut rather, we may ask you how a full\nbackup plus incrementals or a full backup\n\n597\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:27.640\nplus differentials is used to restore\ndata over a four or five day span.\n\n598\n00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.240\nMaybe if we have some sort of\nscenario questions for instance,\n\n599\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.320\nright, do you need the full\nplus all the incrementals,\n\n600\n00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.980\ndo you need the full plus all the\ndifferentials, only one differential one\n\n601\n00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.210\nincremental, do you have to have the full\nif you don't have the full what do you do.\n\n602\n00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.800\nThese are all scenarios of things\nwe'd be worried about, right?\n\n603\n00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.240\nWe wanna understand we have to\nhave the incremental tapes and\n\n604\n00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.270\neveryone of them order.\n\n605\n00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.430\nDo we have to have the differential\ntapes and every one of them in order?\n\n606\n00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.560\nThese are the kind of\nthings we'd want to know.\n\n607\n00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.900\nSo, those are the kinds of questions,\n\n608\n00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:58.090\nthe kinds of things that in this\narea we'd wanna be focusing on.\n\n609\n00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.430\nDefense and depth, we keep coming\nback to this idea very important.\n\n610\n00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:06.120\nBuilding multiple overlapping\nconcentric rings of protection\n\n611\n00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.510\nthat mutually reinforce and\nmutually interact with one another.\n\n612\n00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.430\nThe use of fire walls very important\nyou've mentioned fire walls a couple of\n\n613\n00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.560\ndifferent times for things.\n\n614\n00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.870\nWhether we have host based fire walls and\nthey're hardware based or host based so\n\n615\n00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.940\nwe can have host based software firewalls.\n\n616\n00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.420\nWe could have hardware based\nfirewalls Where we rack and\n\n617\n00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.230\nstack essentially devices.\n\n618\n00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.900\nThe idea is that we're going to create\na boarder gateway defense mechanism as one\n\n619\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.830\nof the rings of protection that\ndoes either port filtering or\n\n620\n00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.910\nIP address mapping and matching.\n\n621\n00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:37.110\nIt will be session aware so\nit keeps track of session state.\n\n622\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.890\nIt's going to allow us to create white and\n\n623\n00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:43.060\nblack lists essentially based on a rule\nset and this is how a firewall works.\n\n624\n00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:45.160\nSo we want to know that.\n\n625\n00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.870\nWe want to think about IDSs and IPSs.\n\n626\n00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.190\nI know we actually have a cool nifty.\n\n627\n00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.590\nWe're gonna use that term,\nthat's a really good term, nifty.\n\n628\n00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:56.640\nA cool nifty little picture that\nwe put up for IDSs and IPSs.\n\n629\n00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.580\n>> Yeah, we just did a good old\nGoogle search for IDS and IPS.\n\n630\n00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.490\nWe found this nice one\nhere by Slideshare.net, so\n\n631\n00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.692\nwe'll just zoom in to that guy.\n\n632\n00:29:03.692 --> 00:29:06.260\n>> All right, so we're going to\njust quickly just highlight for\n\n633\n00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.090\nyou and talk about the.\n\n634\n00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:09.053\nAs I'm moving over in the window.\n\n635\n00:29:09.053 --> 00:29:09.587\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thinking if\n\n636\n00:29:09.587 --> 00:29:10.100\nI move over-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n637\n00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.150\n>> You'll have more room on the screen.\n\n638\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:12.890\nYou know that works so well.\n\n639\n00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.368\nSometimes we're just really not\npaying attention to what we're doing.\n\n640\n00:29:15.368 --> 00:29:15.877\n[LAUGH] Right?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n641\n00:29:15.877 --> 00:29:17.947\n>> So,

this,\nI'm actually supporting the IDS.\n\n647\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.720\nThat's awesome!\n\n648\n00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.760\nI can't get any taller than that.\n\n649\n00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:30.490\nThat right there,\nthat's the tallest I've ever been.\n\n650\n00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.695\nPeriod, that is the tallest\nI've that is it right there.\n\n651\n00:29:34.695 --> 00:29:38.995\nIf you did that you'd be like,\nwe would see from your neck down.\n\n652\n00:29:38.995 --> 00:29:41.165\nYour head would be literally in\nthe cloud and above the frame.\n\n653\n00:29:41.165 --> 00:29:42.085\n>> Just see my chest.\n\n654\n00:29:42.085 --> 00:29:42.965\n>> That's all you would see.\n\n655\n00:29:42.965 --> 00:29:46.207\nYou'd be a headless body supporting a IDS.\n\n656\n00:29:46.207 --> 00:29:47.997\nSo what we have here are IPSs and IDSs.\n\n657\n00:29:47.997 --> 00:29:51.487\nJust wanted to quickly remind you\nof the difference between the two.\n\n658\n00:29:51.487 --> 00:29:53.597\nThe IDS, and\nI believe if I am not mistaken,\n\n659\n00:29:53.597 --> 00:29:55.107\nis IDS on the-\n>> On the left.\n\n660\n00:29:55.107 --> 00:29:56.637\n>> That's on the left,\nokay, I can't really.\n\n661\n00:29:56.637 --> 00:29:57.237\nYeah, thank you.\n\n662\n00:29:57.237 --> 00:29:58.923\nI could see the deployment.\n\n663\n00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:00.343\nI just can't see the concept.\n\n664\n00:30:00.343 --> 00:30:02.283\nThat's network based IDS on the left.\n\n665\n00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:03.923\nWe have a host based IDS on the right.\n\n666\n00:30:03.923 --> 00:30:05.353\nWe're fine,\nwe don't have to move right now.\n\n667\n00:30:05.353 --> 00:30:07.863\nSo just the idea of an IDS first, right?\n\n668\n00:30:07.863 --> 00:30:12.321\nAn IDS intrusion detection system is\ngonna be a passive monitoring system.\n\n669\n00:30:12.321 --> 00:30:15.351\nPeople have to remember,\nCCSPs need to know,\n\n670\n00:30:15.351 --> 00:30:20.031\nwe need to understand that IDSs imply\nthat we are not gonna respond and\n\n671\n00:30:20.031 --> 00:30:23.820\nreconfigure and\npotentially counterattack when we\n\n672\n00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:28.990\ndiscover some sort of malfeasance or bad\naction or activity that's questionable.\n\n673\n00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.140\nBut rather we're going to record, we're\ngonna monitor, we are going to alert and\n\n674\n00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.760\npeople often confuse alerting and\nalarming with activity.\n\n675\n00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.520\nAnd say well no if I'm alerting I'm\ntaking action so it must be an IPS.\n\n676\n00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.230\nNo, if you're alerting or\nalarming, you are notifying.\n\n677\n00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:44.980\nIt's just generically the term we use.\n\n678\n00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.720\nNotification is part of the passive\nmechanism that we use to monitor.\n\n679\n00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.512\nIt's not part of the act of\nresponse mechanism of an IP-\n\n680\n00:30:51.512 --> 00:30:52.033\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n681\n00:30:52.033 --> 00:30:53.729\n>> The bad thing has already happened.\n\n682\n00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:55.090\nAnd it's letting you know.\n\n683\n00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.070\nSomething bad has occurred.\n\n684\n00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:57.890\n>> Essentially yes.\n\n685\n00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.870\nThat is actually a great way of\nthinking about it.I like that a lot.\n\n686\n00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:00.480\nThat is very good.\n\n687\n00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.470\nGive yourself one little gold star\nin petty cash when we're done.\n\n688\n00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:09.290\nSo network based IDS's are going to imply\nwe have some sort of network device.\n\n689\n00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:14.100\nYou can see that the lower left hand\ncorner of the, over there, look at that.\n\n690\n00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.890\nAs I'm moving,\nthat hand is moving with me.\n\n691\n00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.660\nOutstanding.\n\n692\n00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:19.720\nSo that little pointer right there\nthat we are hovering right around,\n\n693\n00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.520\nthe IDS system over there.\n\n694\n00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.020\nThat's it right there.\n\n695\n00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.405\nThe rest of it was the internet,\nthe cloud out all the other stuff.\n\n696\n00:31:25.405 --> 00:31:26.755\n>> Yeah, this is the router and\na firewall.\n\n697\n00:31:26.755 --> 00:31:28.985\n>> That is router there,\nsome sort of gateway device, absolutely.\n\n698\n00:31:28.985 --> 00:31:32.185\nSo the idea in essence is what\nwe call an inline device, right?\n\n699\n00:31:32.185 --> 00:31:35.795\nIt's there on the network, and all the\ntraffic coming through that subnet, coming\n\n700\n00:31:35.795 --> 00:31:40.065\noff that device, that firewall router\nis gonna be monitored through that IDS.\n\n701\n00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.351\nSo any traffic in and\n\n702\n00:31:41.351 --> 00:31:46.200\nout of the three hosts on the right will\nbe seen by the IDS system in this case.\n\n703\n00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.091\nIf we move over to the host-based IDS and\nwe take a look there, we will see that we\n\n704\n00:31:51.091 --> 00:31:55.471\nhave the same setup, we have an IDS\nserver, but we have host base IDSs,\n\n705\n00:31:55.471 --> 00:32:00.216\nwhich means the red agent or the red\nlittle packet which I'm assuming implies\n\n706\n00:32:00.216 --> 00:32:04.540\nagent or software, running there\nwith the red arrows going towards.\n\n707\n00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:07.983\n>> Ultimately, the idea of a server\nindicates that we are monitoring\n\n708\n00:32:07.983 --> 00:32:12.288\nthe traffic at the endpoint and simply\ncentrally aggregating, reporting back and\n\n709\n00:32:12.288 --> 00:32:16.303\nmonitoring it from an all up perspective,\nreporting on it at the IDS server.\n\n710\n00:32:16.303 --> 00:32:21.327\nBut the host base concept is put an agent,\nput a piece of software on every machine.\n\n711\n00:32:21.327 --> 00:32:23.714\nAnd by doing that,\nwe then monitor the endpoint.\n\n712\n00:32:23.714 --> 00:32:28.120\nSo we could, in theory have\njust one of those three hosts.\n\n713\n00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.657\nLet's say, the middle one, hypothetically.\n\n714\n00:32:29.657 --> 00:32:33.636\nI know you can't modify the diagram,\nbut just hypothetically, let's say,\n\n715\n00:32:33.636 --> 00:32:36.529\nwe only saw the red box on that\none endpoint in the middle,\n\n716\n00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:39.380\nthen only that one host's\ntraffic would be monitored.\n\n717\n00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.559\nWe would not see the others\nat the IDS server.\n\n718\n00:32:42.559 --> 00:32:45.724\nBut with the network based IDS,\nwe would see the traffic from all three.\n\n719\n00:32:45.724 --> 00:32:50.018\nSo we want to make sure we understand the\ndifference between IDS network based and\n\n720\n00:32:50.018 --> 00:32:51.281\nhost based and IPS's,\n\n721\n00:32:51.281 --> 00:32:55.404\nintrusion prevension systems, which\nalso are network based or host based.\n\n722\n00:32:55.404 --> 00:32:56.817\nAnd essentially, run the same way.\n\n723\n00:32:56.817 --> 00:33:00.152\nThey would look the same,\nthe diagram would essentially be the same.\n\n724\n00:33:00.152 --> 00:33:04.142\nWe also have wireless based IPS's and\nwireless based IDSs.\n\n725\n00:33:04.142 --> 00:33:06.501\nSo, we have NIDS and NIPS.\n\n726\n00:33:06.501 --> 00:33:11.793\nWe have HIDS and HIPS, WIDS and WIPS.\n\n727\n00:33:11.793 --> 00:33:14.108\nSounds like an interesting weekend.\n\n728\n00:33:14.108 --> 00:33:18.599\nSo we wanna make sure that we understand\nthat we can see these in multiple formats,\n\n729\n00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:21.008\nmultiple frames of\nreference if you will and\n\n730\n00:33:21.008 --> 00:33:23.620\nwe also these days see\ncombined technology.\n\n731\n00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.639\nIDPSs, which are intrusion detection and\nprevention systems all in one.\n\n732\n00:33:27.639 --> 00:33:29.519\nKeep in mind that at home, for instance,\n\n733\n00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:32.552\na lot of these multi-use devices\nyou get from your cable company.\n\n734\n00:33:32.552 --> 00:33:36.154\nThat cable router or DSL modem, or\nwhatever they're giving you these days\n\n735\n00:33:36.154 --> 00:33:39.775\nthat, that's going to have these\ncapabilities built in traditionally.\n\n736\n00:33:39.775 --> 00:33:41.582\nIt's usually a firewall, a router.\n\n737\n00:33:41.582 --> 00:33:46.409\nIt's also gonna provide basic IDS or\nIPS most likely capabilities.\n\n738\n00:33:46.409 --> 00:33:50.213\nAnd so, it's an all in one device that\ndoes a lot of this as a gateway management\n\n739\n00:33:50.213 --> 00:33:52.762\nsystem and\nthat's what we tend to refer to these as.\n\n740\n00:33:52.762 --> 00:33:54.210\nWe also wanna think about honeypots.\n\n741\n00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.226\nHoney pots and or honeynets.\n\n742\n00:33:56.226 --> 00:34:00.966\nThe idea of a honeypot is the idea of\nbeing able to have either one system or\n\n743\n00:34:00.966 --> 00:34:02.920\na small grouping of systems.\n\n744\n00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.891\nThese days, it's traditionally gonna\nbe a virtualized infrastructure.\n\n745\n00:34:05.891 --> 00:34:08.441\nSo, more often than not virtual\nmachines that are running.\n\n746\n00:34:08.441 --> 00:34:12.603\nMake them look and\nmake them feel just to attractive enough.\n\n747\n00:34:12.603 --> 00:34:13.895\nJust exciting enough,\n\n748\n00:34:13.895 --> 00:34:18.106\njust approachable enough that a bad actor\nmay decide to try to hack into them.\n\n749\n00:34:18.106 --> 00:34:20.378\nMay explore them,\nmay fingerprint them a little bit.\n\n750\n00:34:20.378 --> 00:34:23.850\nLooking to see if they can gain an\nadvantage, trying to trick the bad actor\n\n751\n00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.782\ninto thinking this is real infrastructure,\nreal cloud infrastructure running.\n\n752\n00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:32.498\nAnd then we can see hopefully, understand\nassess and monitor from our perspective,\n\n753\n00:34:32.498 --> 00:34:36.496\nfrom the security practitioners\nperspective what did that actress do to\n\n754\n00:34:36.496 --> 00:34:37.429\ntry to break in.\n\n755\n00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:38.814\nWe can study their habits and\n\n756\n00:34:38.814 --> 00:34:42.922\nwe can then try to defend against them by\nbecoming smarter ultimately than they are.\n\n757\n00:34:42.922 --> 00:34:44.403\nHoneynets and honeypots fell\nout of favor for many years.\n\n758\n00:34:44.403 --> 00:34:47.856\nThey were used for awhile and\nnow they were not used for awhile,\n\n759\n00:34:47.856 --> 00:34:50.671\nnow we're coming back and\nseeing them used again.\n\n760\n00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:51.771\nHoneynut.org, for\n\n761\n00:34:51.771 --> 00:34:55.992\ninstance, one of the websites you might\ngo to that you might find information on.\n\n762\n00:34:55.992 --> 00:34:58.124\nSans has some information on honeynets.\n\n763\n00:34:58.124 --> 00:35:01.714\nWe've talked about Sans before\nthe critical security controls,\n\n764\n00:35:01.714 --> 00:35:03.001\nthe top 20 controls.\n\n765\n00:35:03.001 --> 00:35:05.193\nWe talked about in one\nof the prior episodes.\n\n766\n00:35:05.193 --> 00:35:08.529\nThe OAuth will also have some\nstuff on honeypots and honeynets,\n\n767\n00:35:08.529 --> 00:35:10.146\nyou could take a look at there.\n\n768\n00:35:10.146 --> 00:35:12.221\nWe've talked a lot about OAuth, as well.\n\n769\n00:35:12.221 --> 00:35:14.091\nThe use of vulnerability assessments.\n\n770\n00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:15.679\nThe use of log capturing.\n\n771\n00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:19.580\nThe use of penetration testing and\nlog management.\n\n772\n00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:22.351\nThese are all important things that we\nwould also wanna be thinking about.\n\n773\n00:35:22.351 --> 00:35:26.263\nWe've talked about the value of a SIM\nsystem, security information and\n\n774\n00:35:26.263 --> 00:35:29.225\nevent management system and\nwhy this is so important.\n\n775\n00:35:29.225 --> 00:35:31.947\nBeing able to centrally control and\nmanage all of our logging.\n\n776\n00:35:31.947 --> 00:35:34.552\nSo, we have an authoritative record of it.\n\n777\n00:35:34.552 --> 00:35:37.824\nIt's harder for\nthe attacker to go ahead and\n\n778\n00:35:37.824 --> 00:35:41.105\nto destroy all the log\nfiles in every place.\n\n779\n00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:44.418\nIf we keep them in a central place,\nit's easier for us to defend them and\n\n780\n00:35:44.418 --> 00:35:47.749\nit's easier for us to understand\nwhat's happening in near real time.\n\n781\n00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:51.817\nSo today, programs and\nsystems like Splunk, FireEye.\n\n782\n00:35:51.817 --> 00:35:56.297\nThere's all these different ones out\nthere you may choose to use, but these\n\n783\n00:35:56.297 --> 00:36:01.700\nare fairly robust management systems that\ndo log aggregation, do event correlation.\n\n784\n00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:04.188\nBusiness intelligence and\ndata analytics are used.\n\n785\n00:36:04.188 --> 00:36:06.427\nData visualization\ncapabilities are provided.\n\n786\n00:36:06.427 --> 00:36:09.028\nThey're pretty cool systems.\n\n787\n00:36:09.028 --> 00:36:12.696\nEight, nine, ten years ago when you\nwould have been doing this in the field,\n\n788\n00:36:12.696 --> 00:36:15.192\nyou didn't have access to\na lot of this technology.\n\n789\n00:36:15.192 --> 00:36:20.090\nYou would go to an individual machine and\nyou would do it locally on one machine.\n\n790\n00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.395\nAnd it would be harder for\nyou as a security professional,\n\n791\n00:36:23.395 --> 00:36:26.911\nas an IT professional to sense\nthe pattern that was emerging.\n\n792\n00:36:26.911 --> 00:36:30.248\nBecause you may not see a distributed\nattack occurring in real-time unless you\n\n793\n00:36:30.248 --> 00:36:32.737\nwent to 20 different machines and\nsaw the same evidence,\n\n794\n00:36:32.737 --> 00:36:34.101\nI'm gonna attack everywhere.\n\n795\n00:36:34.101 --> 00:36:35.577\nAnd you had to do that manually and\n\n796\n00:36:35.577 --> 00:36:38.707\nyou had to really be able to envision\nthe network, it was a lot harder.\n\n797\n00:36:38.707 --> 00:36:42.566\nThings like what's up gold and silver\nwinds, these monitoring programs that in\n\n798\n00:36:42.566 --> 00:36:45.130\nsome case been around for\na long time, network view.\n\n799\n00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.622\nThese programs were good to a point, but\n\n800\n00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:52.242\nthey would not have real-time intelligence\nin many cases, there would be\n\n801\n00:36:52.242 --> 00:36:56.735\na delay as we were monitoring from\nshow points or agents aggregating up.\n\n802\n00:36:56.735 --> 00:37:00.729\nSo this takes that to the next level not\njust form a monitoring standpoint, but\n\n803\n00:37:00.729 --> 00:37:02.553\nfrom a log management standpoint.\n\n804\n00:37:02.553 --> 00:37:06.313\nIt helps us to really better understand\nthe kind of detail that maybe either from\n\n805\n00:37:06.313 --> 00:37:09.232\na perspective that we would\nwanna see regards to accentuate,\n\n806\n00:37:09.232 --> 00:37:11.609\nunderstanding in controlling\nthe environment.\n\n807\n00:37:11.609 --> 00:37:14.434\nSchedule maintenance and\nchanges are also gonna be critical for\n\n808\n00:37:14.434 --> 00:37:16.218\nour ability to manage infrastructure.\n\n809\n00:37:16.218 --> 00:37:20.898\nWe cannot just decide to take a host\noffline without in the cloud having number\n\n810\n00:37:20.898 --> 00:37:22.061\none a backup plan.\n\n811\n00:37:22.061 --> 00:37:23.684\nNumber two, an availability plan.\n\n812\n00:37:23.684 --> 00:37:27.409\nAnd number three, a communication plan\nthat helps us to understand how to let\n\n813\n00:37:27.409 --> 00:37:31.537\npeople know that their infrastructure will\neither be stabilized and moved somewhere\n\n814\n00:37:31.537 --> 00:37:35.166\nelse for a period of time or become\nunavailable or we'll be switched over.\n\n815\n00:37:35.166 --> 00:37:38.502\nWhen I was driving up, coming up.\n\n816\n00:37:38.502 --> 00:37:39.721\nAs you're probably aware,\n\n817\n00:37:39.721 --> 00:37:42.172\ncuz you see it all the time when\nyou drive by it, I am sure.\n\n818\n00:37:42.172 --> 00:37:46.607\nThey put the signs up on the highway, hey,\nthere'll be road work at 2 o'clock in\n\n819\n00:37:46.607 --> 00:37:51.136\nthe morning on this day and be aware there\nmay be traffic delays or things like that.\n\n820\n00:37:51.136 --> 00:37:53.937\nWe try to pick off times where\nthere's not a lot of traffic.\n\n821\n00:37:53.937 --> 00:37:55.937\nWe try to notify people\ndays in advance and\n\n822\n00:37:55.937 --> 00:37:58.063\nmake them know that\nthere will be an outage.\n\n823\n00:37:58.063 --> 00:38:01.231\nThese are pretty common sense\napproaches we use outside the cloud.\n\n824\n00:38:01.231 --> 00:38:03.065\nWe should use them in the cloud, as well.\n\n825\n00:38:03.065 --> 00:38:06.543\nThere's no substitute for\ngood communication and good planning.\n\n826\n00:38:06.543 --> 00:38:09.534\nYou plan to be successful and you\ncommunicate to people in order to do that\n\n827\n00:38:09.534 --> 00:38:11.691\nand we've got to think about\nthe use of automation,\n\n828\n00:38:11.691 --> 00:38:13.226\nas you talked about earlier as well.\n\n829\n00:38:13.226 --> 00:38:17.226\nThe idea of orchestrating events and\ntrying to control them with some sort of\n\n830\n00:38:17.226 --> 00:38:20.989\nautomation platform is gonna really\nhelp us to get a handle on all this.\n\n831\n00:38:20.989 --> 00:38:22.737\nAll very important stuff to consider.\n\n832\n00:38:22.737 --> 00:38:23.306\n>> That's right.\n\n833\n00:38:23.306 --> 00:38:27.357\nManaging our cloud platforms is really\nno different than managing our on-prem\n\n834\n00:38:27.357 --> 00:38:28.028\nplatforms.\n\n835\n00:38:28.028 --> 00:38:29.772\nEverything requires a security focus,\n\n836\n00:38:29.772 --> 00:38:32.037\ncuz that's what we're\ntrying to accomplish here.\n\n837\n00:38:32.037 --> 00:38:35.622\nA high-level of security and\navailability to our systems,\n\n838\n00:38:35.622 --> 00:38:37.599\nwhether they be cloud or on site.\n\n839\n00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:41.749\nBut if we're managing them correctly,\nhow do we know we know we're doing that?\n\n840\n00:38:41.749 --> 00:38:42.450\nThat's the whole purpose.\n\n841\n00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.581\nMaking sure that you're walking through\nlooking at logs, checking things out.\n\n842\n00:38:46.581 --> 00:38:50.441\nAnd that they are being done according\nto the security plan, which you and\n\n843\n00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:51.820\nyour team have set forth.\n\n844\n00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.751\nThat being said, Adam.\n\n845\n00:38:52.751 --> 00:38:54.132\nI'm looking at our clock.\n\n846\n00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:57.846\nWe have totally exhausted the time on\nthis one, but it was all great stuff.\n\n847\n00:38:57.846 --> 00:39:00.617\nThis is the kind of stuff I\nreally look forward to doing and\n\n848\n00:39:00.617 --> 00:39:02.135\nshooting with guys like Adam.\n\n849\n00:39:02.135 --> 00:39:03.273\nSo, we thank you for dropping by.\n\n850\n00:39:03.273 --> 00:39:05.507\nWe thank you for\nexplaining these concepts to us.\n\n851\n00:39:05.507 --> 00:39:07.011\nWe thank you guys for watching.\n\n852\n00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.911\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n853\n00:39:09.911 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.050\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie, and in\ntoday's episode we are continuing with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.650\ncertified cloud security\nprofessional series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.260\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto guide us down that wandering road so\n\n6\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.340\nthat we might be able to pass that\nexam ourselves, our good friend, Mr.\n\n7\n00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.960\nAdam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.220\nAdam, welcome back to the show, sir.\n\n9\n00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.650\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.530\n>> Good, going exceedingly well,\nswarmingly well, I would say if we were\n\n11\n00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.191\nkeeping with the bee analogy but\nthat's probably not a word, I think.\n\n12\n00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:41.831\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n13\n00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:44.680\nlet's stay away from that thought\nprocess but it is going well.\n\n14\n00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.710\nWe want to continue our conversations\nwith regards to cloud and\n\n15\n00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.850\nwe've been talking a lot about both\nphysical and logical infrastructure in\n\n16\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.540\nthe management, the architecture,\nthe operation, and the security of it and\n\n17\n00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.310\nI thought we've really implied certainly\nboth, we've talked about both,\n\n18\n00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.390\nwe haven't really called out the distinct\ndifference between physical and logical\n\n19\n00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.120\ninfrastructure from an architecture\nstandpoint, from a design standpoint.\n\n20\n00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.550\nThought it might be a good idea to start\nthis conversation which is going to focus\n\n21\n00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.910\nprimarily on compliance and dealing\nwith the C & G RC related activities.\n\n22\n00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.530\nJust to step back for a minute if you will\nand make sure you're comfortable with\n\n23\n00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.860\nthe definitional difference between\nphysical and logical design.\n\n24\n00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.990\nSo, Daniel's offered to help me with this.\n\n25\n00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.870\nHe volunteered, said,\nI got that, I know what that is.\n\n26\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.750\nAnd we're gonna see whether he\nactually does or not right now,\n\n27\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.160\nbecause we did not pre-flight this.\n\n28\n00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.830\nBut I'm gonna give you a big disclaimer.\n\n29\n00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.570\nIf he's wrong, then-\n>> Don't listen to me.\n\n30\n00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.480\n>> This guy right here,\nif he's wrong, him, then it's not me.\n\n31\n00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.960\nI like good, I also sound good.\n\n32\n00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.630\nHe, however, we're not sure.\n\n33\n00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.650\nSo, we're gonna give him a shot, his two\nminutes of stardom here, if you will.\n\n34\n00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.010\nBut I know he's gonna come through for us.\n\n35\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.080\nI know he's gonna give\nyou good information.\n\n36\n00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.850\nSo, let's play the definition game.\n\n37\n00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.880\n>> I'm up to the challenge, coach.\n\n38\n00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.830\n>> Alrighty, so here we go.\n\n39\n00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.480\nSo, let's talk about the difference\nbetween, both physical and\n\n40\n00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.230\nlogical from an architecture perspective,\nright, physical and logical design.\n\n41\n00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.000\nSo, let's probably start with logical,\nright?\n\n42\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.040\nBecause that's going to usually be what\ncomes first, so if we had to define for\n\n43\n00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.230\nthe good folk in ITPro land, ITProTV land,\n\n44\n00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.220\nwhat logical design is,\nwhat would we wanna tell them?\n\n45\n00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.750\n>> I would say the logical design is\nbasically the high level overview\n\n46\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.260\nof the idea of what you wanna do,\n\n47\n00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.460\nright say if I wanted to put a network\ntogether, I'd say I need a switch here,\n\n48\n00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.630\nI'd need a router there,\nI wouldn't specifically be calling out.\n\n49\n00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.140\nAnything, specifically\nnot a specific device but\n\n50\n00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.180\nthe idea that this is\nthe way it's going to flow.\n\n51\n00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.940\nI need them to connect in this way.\n\n52\n00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.120\nMaybe this is going to be a type of\nnetwork or any idea that I want to put on\n\n53\n00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.070\npaper that's going to give us the high\nlevel overview of what I want to build.\n\n54\n00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.770\n>> Okay, so absolutely correct.\n\n55\n00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.910\nAnd we can almost say it's like\nthe policy of network design, right?\n\n56\n00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.620\nIt's the logical architecture, logical\ndesign, that's almost like a policy,\n\n57\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.430\nbecause it's a high level\nstatement of intent.\n\n58\n00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.970\nHigh level view,\nhigh level vision, lack of detail,\n\n59\n00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.470\nin the sense we're don't say we're\ngoing to have Cisco routers,\n\n60\n00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.530\nwe're going to have this model of\nrouter switch, just we need a router.\n\n61\n00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.900\nWe're not going to have this particular\nkind of firewall, Check Point R70,\n\n62\n00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.860\nwe're just going to have a firewall.\n\n63\n00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.290\nWe're not gonna have hosts that\nare running Windows Server 12,\n\n64\n00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.970\nwe're simply gonna have\nhosts in the logical design.\n\n65\n00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.590\nSo, it's almost like\na policy in that respect.\n\n66\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.050\nVery high level statement of intent,\nright?\n\n67\n00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.290\nAnd then, we have our physical design.\n\n68\n00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.970\nSo, what's our physical\ndesign gonna look like?\n\n69\n00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.650\nWhat do we define that as traditionally?\n\n70\n00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.630\n>> Our physical design is going to have\nall those details that our logical\n\n71\n00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.140\ndoes not.\n\n72\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.510\nIt will be the, well here is our Cisco\n2811 router that's going to be here and\n\n73\n00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.440\nit's going to be running an MPLS,\nor connecting this way,\n\n74\n00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.700\nor segregating these networks.\n\n75\n00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.130\nIf I have a server, it's gonna be HP or\na Dell, or whatever the case may be, that\n\n76\n00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.580\nis the actual object that is taking up\nthat space and it is doing x, y, or z job.\n\n77\n00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.860\n>> Okay, so again,\nvery good, 100% correct.\n\n78\n00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.540\nIt is going to, if we keep with the policy\nanalogy, if policy is very similar to\n\n79\n00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.490\nlogical design then process and\nprocedure that drills down tactically,\n\n80\n00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.710\noperationally, giving us the level of\ndetail, the configuration specifications.\n\n81\n00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.190\nThat's what we see in our physical design.\n\n82\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.760\nSo, we use the logical design to\nbuild the physical design from\n\n83\n00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.710\nthe sense that we build off the logical\ndesign adding detail in layers as we go,\n\n84\n00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.630\nI don't know if you're old enough to\nremember when you went to school and\n\n85\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.230\nif you have this point of reference but\nwhen I went to school\n\n86\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.830\nwe had these things called transparencies,\nyou may or may not remember them?\n\n87\n00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.850\n>> Yes, I do.\n>> We used for the overhead projector\n\n88\n00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.320\ntypically, you didn't have classroom\nprojectors the way we do today.\n\n89\n00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.160\nYou had overhead projectors and it was a\nlight box essentially, right, with a clear\n\n90\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.350\ntop screen and you would put this clear\nplastic on it that you could draw on.\n\n91\n00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.730\nAnd your professor would come out, draw\na diagram or something and it would have\n\n92\n00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.520\nthe little square or triangle or\nbox on the top that would project\n\n93\n00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.050\nin a reverse order up so you could see\nthe image and then you could write on it.\n\n94\n00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.060\nIt was kinda cool.\n\n95\n00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.930\nAnd you get these sometimes and they would\nlay them over and you get like two or\n\n96\n00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.270\nthree and they can build right there for\ndesigns and different solutions for you.\n\n97\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.860\nSo, the logical design would come first\nand then the physical gets laid on top and\n\n98\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.290\nis essentially gonna build on that but\nadd more to detail.\n\n99\n00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.660\nSo, we're just gonna make sure\nthat you have a sense of that,\n\n100\n00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.980\nhave a sense of the difference\nbetween the two definitionally, so\n\n101\n00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.670\nthat as we have continued to talk\nthrough this in our other episodes and\n\n102\n00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.140\nyou may hear us refer to it again.\n\n103\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.930\nFrom time to time going forward in other\nepisodes you have an idea you have a sense\n\n104\n00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.550\nof what we're talking about with\nboth logical and physical design.\n\n105\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.130\nAll right, so\nvery good thank you very much.\n\n106\n00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.430\n>> The hand shake there.\n\n107\n00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.390\n>> Awesome job very good all right, so\nIT Service Management we're thinking\n\n108\n00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.240\nabout compliance we're thinking\nabout the way in which we have to\n\n109\n00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.600\nmanage services from the security\nstandpoint and we often talk about ITSM.\n\n110\n00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.340\n>> IT Service Management as a way to do\nthis, this portion of our discussion,\n\n111\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.250\nthis episode and the discussions that will\ncome from it are really gonna be focused\n\n112\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.250\naround the idea of a framework such\nas ITL the IT Infrastructure Library\n\n113\n00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.070\nframework which is\na IT Service Management focused framework\n\n114\n00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.740\nas being one point of reference one way in\nwhich we could frame this conversation.\n\n115\n00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.460\nSo, IT Service Management is gonna help us\nto understand how to officially, how to\n\n116\n00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.000\neffectively, how to securely, design,\ndeliver, manage and consume services.\n\n117\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.620\nYou want to be thinking about that.\n\n118\n00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.710\nWe involve all the people and systems and\n\n119\n00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.060\nitems that are necessary to do that in the\nthought-process around how to build and\n\n120\n00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.060\nmanage that and when we add in from\nthe IT Service Management perspective,\n\n121\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.300\na sub focus on information security\nmanagement, we begin to drill down and\n\n122\n00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.402\nget in to the territory where\nthe CCSP operates, right.\n\n123\n00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:31.395\nBecause ITSF,\nIT Service Management is a broad category,\n\n124\n00:06:31.395 --> 00:06:35.265\nand can encompass the IT professionals and\na lot of different people.\n\n125\n00:06:35.265 --> 00:06:39.565\nAnd so, as a result of that,\nit's not just going to be security folks.\n\n126\n00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.565\nIt's important for us to be there, right?\n\n127\n00:06:41.565 --> 00:06:45.065\nWe want to have a seat at the table\nfrom the CSP's perspective\n\n128\n00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:48.355\nwith regards to ITSF,\nwe definitely want our voice to be heard.\n\n129\n00:06:48.355 --> 00:06:49.415\nWe want to be there.\n\n130\n00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:52.780\nWe want to be, as you indicated to\nus in one of our prior discussions\n\n131\n00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.620\nbe able to build security in early and\n\n132\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.280\noften, not bolt it on after the fact,\nif at all possible.\n\n133\n00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.590\nNot always possible, but if possible.\n\n134\n00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:01.740\nBut the reality is,\n\n135\n00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.360\nit's such a broad field that we\nmay get lost in the shuffle there.\n\n136\n00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.180\nIt may be hard for\nour voice for security and for\n\n137\n00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.710\nsanity and the voice of insanity\nare the face of the insanity we heard.\n\n138\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.530\nDo you remember that commercial for\nmusic, that crazy woman.\n\n139\n00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.800\nWho did the fitness\ncommercial Stop the Insanity.\n\n140\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.350\n>> Yes.\n>> You remember that?\n\n141\n00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.380\n>> Susan Powter.\n\n142\n00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.100\n>> Was that her name?\n\n143\n00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.410\n>> Yes.\n>> Yeah, so just she would be on, and\n\n144\n00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.190\nlike screaming at you on the TV.\n\n145\n00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.400\nAnd she had whatever that\nthing was that she was doing.\n\n146\n00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.630\nShe was repping the product.\n\n147\n00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.350\nBut I just, I always think\nabout that when I talk about\n\n148\n00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.150\ntrying to preach security right,\nin the voice of adversity.\n\n149\n00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.350\nInside the enterprise with regards to\nITSM because it may be hard sometimes for\n\n150\n00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.830\nus to be heard,\nmay be hard for us to be seen.\n\n151\n00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.920\nI often also, carrying on the movie and\nTV references.\n\n152\n00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.910\nCuz that's what we do here at ITProTV.\n\n153\n00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.790\nSo, I often also think about\nA Few Good Men, great movie, right?\n\n154\n00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:51.530\n>> Great movie, fantastic.\n\n155\n00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.260\n>> Classic movie, right?\n\n156\n00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.449\nAnd so, I think about\nthe Jack Nicholson character, right?\n\n157\n00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:58.409\nAnd the first time that Tom Cruise and\nDebbie Moore meet him,\n\n158\n00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:00.568\nwhen they go out to Guantanamo Bay, right?\n\n159\n00:08:00.568 --> 00:08:02.868\nAnd they're having breakfast, right?\n\n160\n00:08:02.868 --> 00:08:04.667\nAnd he's sitting out there on the lawn.\n\n161\n00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:09.489\nAnd you've got this whole power\nstruggle thing going on where they're\n\n162\n00:08:09.489 --> 00:08:14.320\nall sparring with each other trying\nto figure out who's gonna do what.\n\n163\n00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.450\nAnd they're talking and\nat some point Jack says I had breakfast.\n\n164\n00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:21.190\n300 yards away from a thousand\npeople trained to kill me.\n\n165\n00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.260\nAnd of course,\nI'm able to do this or that.\n\n166\n00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:27.180\nAnd he goes into this whole big thing\nabout how good he is and how right he is.\n\n167\n00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.070\nAnd then you see him again\nat the end of the movie,\n\n168\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.685\nwhere they face each other down on\nthe from the courtroom ultimately.\n\n169\n00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:33.935\nBig spoiler alert by the way, right?\n\n170\n00:08:33.935 --> 00:08:34.726\nHe did it, right?\n\n171\n00:08:34.726 --> 00:08:36.725\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you see all that, and\n\n172\n00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.485\nthey're sparring with\neachother again at the end.\n\n173\n00:08:38.485 --> 00:08:41.445\nAnd Cruise, the Tom Cruise character\nultimately pushes his buttons,\n\n174\n00:08:41.445 --> 00:08:43.855\nget him to commit and\nto ultimately admit, right,\n\n175\n00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:45.735\nthat he was able to order the code red,\nand he did it.\n\n176\n00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:47.525\nOf course I did it, it's my job to do it.\n\n177\n00:08:47.525 --> 00:08:51.340\nI'd do it again and either become part\nof the problem or part of the solution.\n\n178\n00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:55.190\nHe says either pick up a gun,\nstand opposed, or get out of my way, and\n\n179\n00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.930\nsimply just let me do my job, right?\n\n180\n00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.030\nThat's essentially the monologue that\nJack delivers along with all the other\n\n181\n00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.930\nstuff, right?\n\n182\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.170\nAnd it's a great moment.\n\n183\n00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:05.140\nIt's one of those classic\nmoments in movie history.\n\n184\n00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.420\nBut it's great for a lot of reasons.\n\n185\n00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.160\nNot the least of which is\nobviously the people involved and\n\n186\n00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.330\nall the story behind it.\n\n187\n00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:14.470\nBut in addition to that, from our\nperspective here, it's the classic example\n\n188\n00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.210\nof what we talk about with CCSP's\nbeing in the wilderness, right?\n\n189\n00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.610\nHaving to stand guard.\n\n190\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.550\nHaving to be that lone voice,\nknowing they're right, right?\n\n191\n00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:24.610\nThe Tom Cruise character knows he's right.\n\n192\n00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.020\nHe knows.\nHe's figured it out.\n\n193\n00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.740\nJack did it, but he's gotta prove it.\n\n194\n00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.070\nHe's gotta get him to admit it.\n\n195\n00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:32.040\nBut he doesn't admit it, and every\ncharacter around him is telling him hey,\n\n196\n00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.570\ndon't push him.\n\n197\n00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.460\nIf you do, it's your ass, right?\n\n198\n00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.420\nThey're gonna come get you.\n\n199\n00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.990\nRemember the Kevin Bacon character.\n\n200\n00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.202\nBack to Bacon?\n>> Yes, back to Bacon.\n\n201\n00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.086\n[LAUGH]\n>> So okay.\n\n202\n00:09:39.086 --> 00:09:42.618\nSo Kevin Bacon character, opposing\ncounsel, says to him when they're having\n\n203\n00:09:42.618 --> 00:09:45.900\nthat beer right before the trial,\nhey, you know, don't do it, right?\n\n204\n00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.951\nIf you go after him I gotta,\nyou know, I'm going to take you on.\n\n205\n00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:50.539\nI'm going to have to essentially sue you,\nright?\n\n206\n00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:51.840\nThe government's going to\nhave to come after you.\n\n207\n00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.680\nAnd the Demi Moore character says,\ndon't do it, unless you can prove it.\n\n208\n00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.330\nDon't do it.\n\n209\n00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.700\nI'm a JAG officer, I'm telling you,\nyou can get in trouble, right?\n\n210\n00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.320\nDon't do it.\n\n211\n00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.320\nBut yet despite all that he sits there and\nhe figures it out.\n\n212\n00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.000\nIt's that commitment,\nthat ability to be that voice of reason,\n\n213\n00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.390\nthat the SSCP needs to bring to the table,\nand\n\n214\n00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.250\ninformation security management\nis really how we do that.\n\n215\n00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.170\nWe have a sub-focus inside ITSM that\nallows us to talk about the security\n\n216\n00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.763\nimplications of our decisions, allows us\nto focus on the security requirements,\n\n217\n00:10:22.763 --> 00:10:25.390\nof the architecture, logical and physical.\n\n218\n00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.780\nSo we've talked about security policies,\nsecurity management,\n\n219\n00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:33.480\ninformation security organization, laying\nout what the road map looks like, and\n\n220\n00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.750\nthe org chart looks like,\nfrom a security perspective.\n\n221\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.032\nEffective asset management,\nhuman resource security,\n\n222\n00:10:39.032 --> 00:10:43.448\nphysical and environmental security,\naccess control, I can go on and on, right.\n\n223\n00:10:43.448 --> 00:10:47.440\nThese are all the things that Information\nSecurity Management is going to focus on.\n\n224\n00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.706\nSo we have to think about inside of ITSM,\nall the sub areas that we're gonna carve\n\n225\n00:10:53.706 --> 00:10:57.870\nout and deal with in Information Security\nManagement from the CCSPs respective.\n\n226\n00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:00.590\nIt's going to be one of\nthose most important areas.\n\n227\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.520\nIt's not the only one, but\nit is a very important one.\n\n228\n00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:08.060\nIn addition to information security\nmanagement, in the overarching thought\n\n229\n00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:13.640\nprocess, we have to subdivide into all\nthese active areas that we either as\n\n230\n00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:19.430\nCCSV's, I was about to say SSCP's, as\nCCSP's can engage it, and obviously drive\n\n231\n00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:23.470\ndialog around and commit changes through\nand understand how to manage against.\n\n232\n00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.340\nWe have to think about all these other\nareas that we engage in as well.\n\n233\n00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.595\nSo things like change management, incident\nand problem management, configuration\n\n234\n00:11:31.595 --> 00:11:35.825\nmanagement, availability management,\nrelease and deployment management.\n\n235\n00:11:35.825 --> 00:11:38.535\nAll of these things are gonna be\nvery valuable and important as well,\n\n236\n00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:40.687\nand we're gonna delve into and\ntalk about all these areas.\n\n237\n00:11:40.687 --> 00:11:44.777\nThis is all, remember as I said at\nthe beginning, framed from the ITIL\n\n238\n00:11:44.777 --> 00:11:47.677\nframework perspective,\nthe IT Infrastructure Library perspective.\n\n239\n00:11:47.677 --> 00:11:50.037\nSo we have to ask ourselves\nthe question of, you know,\n\n240\n00:11:50.037 --> 00:11:51.387\nwhat is going to be important?\n\n241\n00:11:51.387 --> 00:11:54.077\nHow are we going to\nframe this conversation?\n\n242\n00:11:54.077 --> 00:11:57.267\nI've talked a lot in prior episodes\nabout the joining of the hip,\n\n243\n00:11:57.267 --> 00:12:00.707\nif you will, between change management and\nrisk management, and\n\n244\n00:12:00.707 --> 00:12:04.650\nthe idea that they, essentially,\nare two sides of the same coin.\n\n245\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:07.510\nThat they are mirrored opposites\nof one another in the sense\n\n246\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.310\nthat they sit at different\nareas of our organization, but\n\n247\n00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.130\nyou cannot have one effectively\nimplemented without the other.\n\n248\n00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.820\nIt's impossible, and I will go on\nrecord as saying so right here and now.\n\n249\n00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.230\nMy name is Daniel, and\nif anybody has any questions,\n\n250\n00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.450\ncan we put my email address up\nthere to make sure they respond?\n\n251\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.136\nIf anybody has any questions let me know.\n\n252\n00:12:25.136 --> 00:12:29.290\nBut seriously,\nwe cannot do risk management and\n\n253\n00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.800\ndo it well without change management being\nmature and implemented in an organization.\n\n254\n00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.930\nWe can not have effective change\nmanagement in an organization\n\n255\n00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:42.590\nwithout a mature and well-developed\nassessment of risk in the organization.\n\n256\n00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:46.130\nIt is impossible to do one without the\nother, because we have no way of creating\n\n257\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.910\nthe context, the frame of reference, the\npoint of view, that feeds the inputs and\n\n258\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:55.200\ngives us the criteria to measure\nagainst for one without the other.\n\n259\n00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.640\nChange is gonna have to be controlled,\nand managed, and\n\n260\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.120\nunderstood through the framework of risk.\n\n261\n00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:04.760\nAnd risk must be measured, must be\nassessed, must be maintained, in terms of\n\n262\n00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.250\nbeing vigilant around it, and monitoring\naround and for it, through the lexicon, or\n\n263\n00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.850\nthrough the discussion of change\nmanagement's vocabulary and\n\n264\n00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.060\nhow we understand what a change is,\nand what it implies.\n\n265\n00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.000\nAnd how to manage it effectively,\nhow to schedule it, how to monitor it,\n\n266\n00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.600\nhow to implement it, how to approve it, or\nnot, and then ultimately how to go forward\n\n267\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.460\nto implement the change and to back\nout that change if there is a problem.\n\n268\n00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.790\nAnd to do so at every step along\nthe way by being aware of risk and\n\n269\n00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.850\nwhat the risk is at any point in time.\n\n270\n00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:36.760\nWe have to join these two\nthings at the hip, right,\n\n271\n00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.870\nproverbially, and\nmake sure we understand the linkage there.\n\n272\n00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.670\nIt's going to be very,\nvery important for us.\n\n273\n00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.960\nWhen we think about configuration\nmanagement, we think about the ability to\n\n274\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:49.910\nunderstand how to document all\nof the information required for\n\n275\n00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:55.020\nus to maintain an understanding of\nhow infrastructure is to be set up,\n\n276\n00:13:55.020 --> 00:14:00.600\nis to be, ultimately, managed, is to be\noperated, and throughout its life cycle,\n\n277\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.500\nis to be assessed for\neither a secure or insecure state.\n\n278\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.320\nEither it's compliant or it's not.\n\n279\n00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:09.450\nSo configuration management\nis about taking a snapshot.\n\n280\n00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.060\nNot the kind of snapshot we take when\nwe snapshot a system, but a picture,\n\n281\n00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.050\nproverbially a snapshot of the as is,\n\n282\n00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.690\nthe current state of what\nthat system looks like.\n\n283\n00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.944\nAnd then measuring that to ensure it\nstays that way, and if it migrates,\n\n284\n00:14:22.944 --> 00:14:26.149\nif it moves, if it changes,\nif it in any way deviates,\n\n285\n00:14:26.149 --> 00:14:30.191\nwe are alerted to the fact that there\nis some sort of gap, a delta, and\n\n286\n00:14:30.191 --> 00:14:34.794\nthat we have to decide whether to assess\nthat change, and whether to allow it,\n\n287\n00:14:34.794 --> 00:14:39.189\nor whether to what we call remediate,\nto effectively put back the system to\n\n288\n00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:43.239\na prior well known or prior good\nstate where the changes are erased.\n\n289\n00:14:43.239 --> 00:14:45.224\nWe have a variety of\nmechanisms to do this,\n\n290\n00:14:45.224 --> 00:14:48.800\nhow we do it is not as important as\nknowing that we need to be aware of it.\n\n291\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.660\nSo in the language of\nconfiguration management, we often\n\n292\n00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.460\ntalk about configuration management\ndatabases, what are called CMDBs.\n\n293\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.970\nThis is simply the repository for\n\n294\n00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.010\nall the changes that we\nare recording in the organization.\n\n295\n00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:04.650\nIn the modern ecosystems, and the cloud\nwe traditionally refer to this as part of\n\n296\n00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:08.710\na broader configuration management,\nand or asset management platform.\n\n297\n00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:13.300\nSo system center, HP Openview, IBM Tivoli.\n\n298\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.390\nAny of these programs are asset\nmanagement solutions.\n\n299\n00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.350\nSo the Wins has one.\n\n300\n00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.660\nThe what is it, I'm thinking of semantic,\n\n301\n00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:28.430\nnot semantic, Altiers,\nright Altiers has one.\n\n302\n00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.710\nThey have a whole asset management package\nas well, any of these vendors, all of\n\n303\n00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:36.720\nthem, are going to create, essentially,\nand have in those capabilities\n\n304\n00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.290\nconfiguration management opportunities and\nthe CMDB is part of that.\n\n305\n00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.910\nAnd we then have what are known as CI's,\nconfiguration items.\n\n306\n00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.390\nCI's are going to be the entries\nthat we put into the CMBD,\n\n307\n00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.660\nthe individual component entries\nabout this configuration.\n\n308\n00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.260\nOur standard desktop image, Windows 10.\n\n309\n00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.530\nRight, with service pack\n1 running Office 2016.\n\n310\n00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.580\nThat is a configuration item, a CI,\nthat is entered into the CMDB,\n\n311\n00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.148\nthe configuration management database.\n\n312\n00:16:04.148 --> 00:16:08.162\nAnd it becomes part of our baseline that\nwe use to measure whether or not all\n\n313\n00:16:08.162 --> 00:16:12.680\nthe desktops in our system are running\neither compliant or out of compliance.\n\n314\n00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.370\nAnd then if they're out of compliance, we\nwould have typically a baseline image or\n\n315\n00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.060\na template of some kind that\nwe can use to remediate.\n\n316\n00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:23.280\nWe can re-apply essentially and\nchange that configuration.\n\n317\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.080\nHow did you guys used to do this, years\nago, when you were working at the Bureau?\n\n318\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.690\nWhat did you guys do to do\nconfiguration management?\n\n319\n00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.960\nWas it roughly what I was describing and\nmore or less handled the same way?\n\n320\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.310\n>> Yeah, a lot of times, though,\nthey would just basically,\n\n321\n00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.710\nthings like our router configs or\nour servers the way they are.\n\n322\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.790\nWe would just actually download those\nthings, keep copies of them offsite.\n\n323\n00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.750\nAnd that way,\nif we needed to reupload them, we could.\n\n324\n00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.060\n>> Okay, so\nyou have that one way to do it.\n\n325\n00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:49.924\nIn the government and the military,\nespecially in the military,\n\n326\n00:16:49.924 --> 00:16:52.959\nat least the United States anyway,\nwe have a process that we refer to.\n\n327\n00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:55.461\nYou typically,\nwhether it comes from DISA/G, or\n\n328\n00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:59.185\nwhether it comes from one of those\nagencies that will put out this guidance,\n\n329\n00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.469\nwe get what are commonly\nreferred to as STIGS.\n\n330\n00:17:01.469 --> 00:17:05.978\nSecure technical implementation guidance\nor guidelines we essentially get a build\n\n331\n00:17:05.978 --> 00:17:09.721\nright of some kind of or a master image\nand a book about how to deploy it,\n\n332\n00:17:09.721 --> 00:17:13.994\nwhat to do with it, guidance associated\nwith it and the stig is going to tell us.\n\n333\n00:17:13.994 --> 00:17:18.177\nHow we can use that system and what it\nlooks like and what the baseline for\n\n334\n00:17:18.177 --> 00:17:21.105\nsecure management is going\nto be expected to be and\n\n335\n00:17:21.105 --> 00:17:24.055\nas a result of that,\nthat's our configuration.\n\n336\n00:17:24.055 --> 00:17:25.315\nThat's what we run with.\n\n337\n00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:28.310\nYou want to run Windows 8 or 8.1.\n\n338\n00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.065\nYou've got to look up the STIG,\nand you've got to run Windows 8 or\n\n339\n00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:34.250\n8.1 according to what the STIG\nsays you will or will not do.\n\n340\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.480\nOtherwise you can't run it successfully,\nyou're not allowed to use it\n\n341\n00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.450\nin certain networks unless it meets\nthose configuration requirements.\n\n342\n00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.215\nSo we've got to think about that.\n\n343\n00:17:41.215 --> 00:17:45.190\nSo the configuration management process\nallows us to develop over time and\n\n344\n00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.470\nimplement new configurations\ncuz your Windows 7 comes out,\n\n345\n00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.033\neventually Windows 8 comes out, eventually\nWindows 10 comes out on the desktop.\n\n346\n00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:58.008\nServer 12's out on the server side, then\n1202 and then Server 16 or whatever comes\n\n347\n00:17:58.008 --> 00:18:01.822\nout after that so we to constantly\nbe accessing new infrastructure and\n\n348\n00:18:01.822 --> 00:18:04.105\nfigure out how to integrate it over time.\n\n349\n00:18:04.105 --> 00:18:07.737\nWe have to do quality evaluations\nof the configuration secure.\n\n350\n00:18:07.737 --> 00:18:11.829\nQuality assurance, to assure they\nare as hardened, as patched,\n\n351\n00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:13.910\nas secure as they can be.\n\n352\n00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:18.860\nIf we have a template, and then let's\nsay that template is maybe three or\n\n353\n00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.530\nfour months old, it's already been out for\nthree or four months?\n\n354\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.780\nWe have to put new patches into that\ntemplate to update it over time, or\n\n355\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.390\nwhat will happen is, essentially, the\npatches that are released from the vendor.\n\n356\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.330\nThe Microsofts, the VMWares,\nthe Ciscos of the world.\n\n357\n00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:33.900\nWhoever or whatever it is,\n\n358\n00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.050\nover time will have what's\ncalled essentially drift, right?\n\n359\n00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:39.280\nThe image is over here,\nand we get further and\n\n360\n00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.274\nfurther away from what the current patch\ndate should look like, and that delta,\n\n361\n00:18:43.274 --> 00:18:47.031\nthat gap gets so big at a certain point\nthat if we don't update the image, and\n\n362\n00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:49.406\nbring it compliant to\nthe current patch level.\n\n363\n00:18:49.406 --> 00:18:52.248\nWe are deploying an insecure image,\none that is so\n\n364\n00:18:52.248 --> 00:18:55.969\nfar out of compliance at this point\nthat we may have maybe an hour or\n\n365\n00:18:55.969 --> 00:19:00.999\ntwo hour gap there where we're autoloading\nthose patches after the image is deployed.\n\n366\n00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:04.252\nAnd that's a window a bad actor can\ntake advantage of that system and\n\n367\n00:19:04.252 --> 00:19:06.821\nif we're not careful potentially\nuse it against us so\n\n368\n00:19:06.821 --> 00:19:10.528\nwe have to think about that cuz a lot of\nour customers will tell me especially in\n\n369\n00:19:10.528 --> 00:19:13.864\nthe cloud well we just don't update\nthose templates all that often.\n\n370\n00:19:13.864 --> 00:19:18.690\nOr we get basic templates from\nthe cloud vendor right in a pass model.\n\n371\n00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.520\nAnd it's up to them to decide,\nessentially.\n\n372\n00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.840\nIt's up to them to patch manage.\n\n373\n00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:25.790\nI just apply the OS, they give me Server\n12 R2, that's what I choose on Amazon.\n\n374\n00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.190\nI don't know how patched it is,\nI just know I deploy it.\n\n375\n00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.100\nIf it needs more patches,\nI set it up and, essentially, you know,\n\n376\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.870\npatch management from Windows\ncomes down and takes care of it.\n\n377\n00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.480\nWell, okay, right I get that but\nwhat about the interim?\n\n378\n00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.650\nWhat about the time between\nwhen you deploy it and\n\n379\n00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.460\nultimately how it become patched?\n\n380\n00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:44.740\nThere is a window where a bad\nactor can and indeed will.\n\n381\n00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.784\nRight if they find you,\ntake advantage of that.\n\n382\n00:19:46.784 --> 00:19:50.218\nSo you gotta understand that you\ngotta be on top of these things and\n\n383\n00:19:50.218 --> 00:19:53.291\nconfiguration management helps\nus to keep track of this.\n\n384\n00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:57.550\nAlso prevents unauthorized changes from\ngoing on unrecognized and unchallenged.\n\n385\n00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.550\nAgain if we have a standard baseline, a\nstandardized way of viewing the world, and\n\n386\n00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.780\nwe see through continuous monitoring,\nthat these five servers seem to not be\n\n387\n00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.590\nconfigured that way,\nthat should stand out.\n\n388\n00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.470\nAnd indeed it will, as a red flag.\n\n389\n00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.760\nAnd we have to be aware of that also.\n\n390\n00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.520\nSo changing systems and\nmaking configuration changes\n\n391\n00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:17.800\nshould be red-flagged in an organization\nwith configuration management.\n\n392\n00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.490\n>> Is this like the Dell Kace or\nShavlik type of software suites?\n\n393\n00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:23.680\nIs that what they do?\n\n394\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.380\n>> So, it can do that.\n\n395\n00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.680\nThere's other things that\nit does besides that.\n\n396\n00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.280\nNot so much Shavlik, but\ncertainly the Dell software does.\n\n397\n00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.020\nShavlik is.\n\n398\n00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.510\n>> More a patch management system?\n\n399\n00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.380\n>> Yeah, more along those lines, and\nsome other things associated with it.\n\n400\n00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.040\nBut it's not really as much about\nconfiguration management, but\n\n401\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.650\nmore like so\nthe Dell example's a good one.\n\n402\n00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.520\nMore like as I said\nthe Altira System which is Ke Labs.\n\n403\n00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.790\nYou may notice different names.\n\n404\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.540\nBut the Altira System is very popular.\n\n405\n00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.990\nSolar Winds has a platform that does this.\n\n406\n00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.510\nCertainly Microsoft Systems Center,\nSystems Center Config Manager would\n\n407\n00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:01.670\nbe the sub-product within\nthe Systems Center library or suite.\n\n408\n00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:05.950\nOpen view tivilie there's many,\nmany products out there that do this but\n\n409\n00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.870\nyeah any of those products along that\nline would be essentially the kind of\n\n410\n00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:10.100\nthing we're doing here.\n\n411\n00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.660\nWindows in Tune which is the cloud based\nversion of system center config manager\n\n412\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.250\nkinda SCCM lite through the cloud\nwould be a cloud SAS version\n\n413\n00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.110\nof this to a limited degree, so those kind\nof things would be the things we wanna\n\n414\n00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.010\nthink about configuration management and\nchange management.\n\n415\n00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.970\nAs I said, really important to link\nthese these two together, right?\n\n416\n00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:33.130\nWe should never allow changes\nto occur to configurations\n\n417\n00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.000\nunless we run them through a formal\nchange management process.\n\n418\n00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.950\nSo, if I want to make\na change to something,\n\n419\n00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:42.430\nand there is a formal change management\nprocess employed in the organization,\n\n420\n00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:47.110\nit should run something approximately like\nthe story line I'm about to lay out for\n\n421\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.620\nyou here over the next minute or so.\n\n422\n00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.230\nSo if I want to request a change,\n\n423\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:54.840\nwe actually have a formal process called\nan RFC, a request for change management.\n\n424\n00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.450\nIt's essentially you putting in\na change ticket of some kind,\n\n425\n00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:01.710\nI want to fulfill this\nparticular system configuration,\n\n426\n00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:03.750\nI want to patch this system,\nI want to do this.\n\n427\n00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:08.020\nI'm writing up my change request and\nI'm submitting it into the system.\n\n428\n00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.880\nNow certain changes,\nwhat are called normal changes,\n\n429\n00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.450\ncan be approved automatically.\n\n430\n00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.880\nIf you just wanna go ahead and\nyou wanna order a brand new keyboard,\n\n431\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.790\nthat may not require all the bells and\nwhistles, and the meetings, and\n\n432\n00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:23.280\nthe 10,000 things we gotta do to\nget a new server brought online.\n\n433\n00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.900\nThat's just a pretty standard concept\nreally no disruption to the environment.\n\n434\n00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.400\nIt's like sometimes what we\ncall a pre-approved change.\n\n435\n00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.490\nYou can just put in for it, and assuming\nthat there's no mitigating circumstances.\n\n436\n00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:37.060\nThis is the 20th keyboard this\nmonth you've ordered, and\n\n437\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.210\nwe think you're going into business\nselling them for yourself.\n\n438\n00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:41.070\nSo we're not going to\ngive you another one.\n\n439\n00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.460\nBut aside from that, right?\n\n440\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.970\nUnless you're doing something crazy.\n\n441\n00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:47.150\nIf you just need a new keyboard cuz\nyours broke, you put in a request and\n\n442\n00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:48.950\nthen essentially it actually\njust provisions it.\n\n443\n00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:49.750\nIt gets fulfilled.\n\n444\n00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.330\nWe call that a normal change, or\njust a pre-approved change traditionally.\n\n445\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:56.390\nA standard change,\na change that must be approved.\n\n446\n00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.910\nRight it's going to be a change\nthat you put in writing.\n\n447\n00:22:58.910 --> 00:22:59.800\nYou submit it.\n\n448\n00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.490\nThere's usually what's called a CAB.\n\n449\n00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.470\nA change advisory board,\nor change control board.\n\n450\n00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.677\nYou hear it referred to different ways.\n\n451\n00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:08.654\nBut ultimately in the standard\nlanguage of change management,\n\n452\n00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:11.143\nstandard project management,\nstandard language.\n\n453\n00:23:11.143 --> 00:23:14.310\nWe call it a CAB, change advisory board.\n\n454\n00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:17.450\nThat board may be a standing board,\nin this case it would be for\n\n455\n00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:22.140\nstandard changes, meaning it meets on\na scheduled basis, once every week,\n\n456\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.990\nonce every other week, once a month,\ndoesn't matter the frequency.\n\n457\n00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:28.230\nPoint is, depends on the time of the year,\ndepends on the amount of changes that\n\n458\n00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:30.560\nare happening, but\nyou have a scheduled meeting.\n\n459\n00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:34.330\nAfter that meeting you have an agenda,\nyou put in a request to get on\n\n460\n00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:39.280\nthe agenda prior, it walk through whatever\nprocess you have to vet those up front.\n\n461\n00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.290\nIf they are approved they\nare put on the agenda.\n\n462\n00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:45.300\nThe change requests are and then at\nthe meeting the change request is read,\n\n463\n00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.210\neverybody comes in, the appropriate\npeople get to come in and talk.\n\n464\n00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.136\nSo if you're the system owner you\nmay get invited to come in and\n\n465\n00:23:51.136 --> 00:23:54.247\ndo a little presentation on whether\nthis is a good or a bad change.\n\n466\n00:23:54.247 --> 00:23:58.023\nAnd whether we wanna allow it, maybe we're\nbringing in a vendor because a vendor's\n\n467\n00:23:58.023 --> 00:24:01.372\ngonna help us implement this change if\nwe go ahead and decide to go forward so\n\n468\n00:24:01.372 --> 00:24:03.393\nmaybe they come in,\nthey do a presentation,\n\n469\n00:24:03.393 --> 00:24:05.706\nthey speak whatever it is,\nit's an open meeting.\n\n470\n00:24:05.706 --> 00:24:08.307\nDifferent people with different\nchanges show up for different reasons.\n\n471\n00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:13.262\nAt the end of the meeting,\nwe go through and approve, or we deny.\n\n472\n00:24:13.262 --> 00:24:17.812\nMeaning, we will either recommend that\nthe change be pushed out of the change\n\n473\n00:24:17.812 --> 00:24:21.110\ncommittee and go back to the system for\nfinal approval.\n\n474\n00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.034\nOr we deny, we in a sense we say no,\nthis change is not good,\n\n475\n00:24:24.034 --> 00:24:25.750\nwe don't recommend it out.\n\n476\n00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:28.440\nThe CAB never actually\nauthorizes the change.\n\n477\n00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.910\nThe cab merely recommends the change and\nthen the system owner\n\n478\n00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.070\nhas to ultimately decide whether\nthe change will be implemented and when.\n\n479\n00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.375\nSo we make a recommendation,\nwe push it out.\n\n480\n00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:38.552\nWe then go to release and\n\n481\n00:24:38.552 --> 00:24:41.905\ndeployment management to\nactually schedule the change.\n\n482\n00:24:41.905 --> 00:24:45.485\nTo actually go through and say, okay we're\ngonna do our interoperability testing,\n\n483\n00:24:45.485 --> 00:24:48.135\nour regression testing,\nour QA, our staging.\n\n484\n00:24:48.135 --> 00:24:51.325\nThat's gonna take a week and then,\nwe have a maintenance window coming up.\n\n485\n00:24:51.325 --> 00:24:54.684\nSo in 7 days, on the 25th,\nat 2 in the morning, between 2 and\n\n486\n00:24:54.684 --> 00:24:56.105\n4 is maintenance window.\n\n487\n00:24:56.105 --> 00:24:59.650\nWe're gonna schedule this change along\nwith five others that were recommended.\n\n488\n00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.234\nAnd they're all gonna get done\nduring that two hour window and\n\n489\n00:25:02.234 --> 00:25:03.830\nthen we're gonna notify everybody.\n\n490\n00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.750\nWe're gonna start that whole process and\n\n491\n00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.720\nthen we're gonna come up\nwith a deployment plan.\n\n492\n00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.054\nAnd then at the end of that deployment,\nif it all goes well, we're gonna\n\n493\n00:25:11.054 --> 00:25:15.170\nthen be able to close out that change\nticket and say yes, deployed successfully.\n\n494\n00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.320\nAnd then, we're done and\n\n495\n00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.890\nwe go to what's known as a PIR,\na post-implementation review.\n\n496\n00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:24.140\nSometimes called a lessons learned,\nor a post mortem-\n\n497\n00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.260\n>> After action report.\n\n498\n00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.310\n>> After action report.\n\n499\n00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.713\nIt's called different things depending\non whose methodology you're using.\n\n500\n00:25:29.713 --> 00:25:33.488\nBut in project management and IT language,\nit's essentially referred to as a PIR more\n\n501\n00:25:33.488 --> 00:25:35.990\noften than not,\na post-implementation review.\n\n502\n00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:38.180\nAnd the idea is that we do\na lessons learned, right?\n\n503\n00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.350\nWe go through and look at what worked.\n\n504\n00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.250\nWell hey,\nthe change management window was good.\n\n505\n00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.550\nWe hit our maintenance window,\nall the testing was done,\n\n506\n00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.090\nchange was straightforward.\n\n507\n00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.040\nCheck, check, check, good,\ngood, good, and we're done.\n\n508\n00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.200\nOr, wow, blew up, right,\n\n509\n00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.855\n[LAUGH] five seconds in, smoke shooting\nout of the sides of the computer.\n\n510\n00:25:53.855 --> 00:25:56.575\nAnd all of a sudden,\neverything just went dark and\n\n511\n00:25:56.575 --> 00:26:00.275\nI woke up and we were in\na smoking ruin of a data center.\n\n512\n00:26:00.275 --> 00:26:02.797\nSomething happened and so,\nnow we've got to work backwards and\n\n513\n00:26:02.797 --> 00:26:06.587\nroot cause and analyze and\nfigure out what went wrong.\n\n514\n00:26:06.587 --> 00:26:10.347\nSo we're giving ourselves the opportunity\nto either say, good job, and\n\n515\n00:26:10.347 --> 00:26:13.157\nlearn what was good, so\nwe can propagate that forward.\n\n516\n00:26:13.157 --> 00:26:17.393\nOr, hey not so good and we need what's\ncalled a backout plan or a rollback plan\n\n517\n00:26:17.393 --> 00:26:21.972\nto prevent that change that now caused\nthat catastrophe from becoming permanent.\n\n518\n00:26:21.972 --> 00:26:25.720\nSo this is linked to the idea of\nconfiguration management, as well.\n\n519\n00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.406\nIn the change management process and we\nexecute our backout or rollback plan and\n\n520\n00:26:29.406 --> 00:26:33.216\nthen, we do a lessons learned to figure\nout what went wrong, root cause analyze.\n\n521\n00:26:33.216 --> 00:26:36.789\nAnd then step back, reconfigure,\nregroup, try it again, but\n\n522\n00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:40.410\nthis time based on what we learned,\nhopefully get it right.\n\n523\n00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:44.960\nSo this is that whole process, but change\nshould never be allowed to go forward\n\n524\n00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.520\nunless it has been run through\nthe system and is somehow authorized.\n\n525\n00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.320\nNow that's a standard change.\n\n526\n00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.430\nWe also have this process for\nwhat's known as an emergency change.\n\n527\n00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.308\nWhat's known as an ECAB,\nan emergency change advisory board.\n\n528\n00:26:57.308 --> 00:27:02.869\nDoesn't meet on a standing cycle, but\nis called into meet only when we have,\n\n529\n00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:06.120\na very, very specific kind of change.\n\n530\n00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.750\nOne that rises above the level\nof a standard change.\n\n531\n00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.200\nThere's usually a monetary value,\na dollar value associated with this.\n\n532\n00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.400\nIt may be that it's above\n$100.,000 of potential Impact.\n\n533\n00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.060\nThen we need senior management\ninvolved to decide whether to do it.\n\n534\n00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.820\nThis may be buying a new system.\n\n535\n00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.660\nThis may be having to replace a firewall.\n\n536\n00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:26.210\nWho knows what it is, right and\nit's not a magic number,\n\n537\n00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:30.180\nit's not 100,000, it's whatever\nthe business says that pain threshold is.\n\n538\n00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.674\nBut emergency changes are changes\nthat come up out of the blue and\n\n539\n00:27:33.674 --> 00:27:38.077\nthat have to be dealt with immediately and\ncannot be scheduled for discussion and\n\n540\n00:27:38.077 --> 00:27:40.686\nthen projected into our\nmaintenance windows.\n\n541\n00:27:40.686 --> 00:27:42.110\nWe have to deal with them right away.\n\n542\n00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.330\nSo we have kind of an out of band\nprocess that's gonna come online.\n\n543\n00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.330\nAnd it's going to be on\ndemand to deal with this,\n\n544\n00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:49.450\nwe call these emergency changes.\n\n545\n00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:52.810\nWhatever those changes are, we have\nto run them through a process where\n\n546\n00:27:52.810 --> 00:27:54.590\nmore than one person looks than them.\n\n547\n00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.730\nMore than one person understands them,\n\n548\n00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.440\nmore than one person is\ninvolved in authorizing them.\n\n549\n00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.720\nWhat we don't want is,\nsomeone sitting in a dark room, right?\n\n550\n00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.860\nAnd just randomly deciding whether\nit's a good idea or not to do this.\n\n551\n00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.410\nBecause chances are good that we're gonna\nhave a problem, right, if they do that.\n\n552\n00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.120\nThere's likely chaos at\nthe end of that tunnel and\n\n553\n00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.820\nwe don't want to see that happening.\n\n554\n00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.704\nThat would be bad, so we want to really\nunderstand the focus of change management.\n\n555\n00:28:17.704 --> 00:28:21.720\nWant to really understand the focus of\nhow change management should be pursued.\n\n556\n00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.850\nRemember, just because it's in the cloud,\ndoesn't mean we don't do it.\n\n557\n00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.670\nIt just means we do it the same way,\ntraditionally, but\n\n558\n00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.160\nwe put the word cloud in front\nof a lot of our processes.\n\n559\n00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.760\nSo it's cloud-based change management,\nas opposed to just change management.\n\n560\n00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.850\nIt's a release and\ndeployment management for the cloud.\n\n561\n00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.770\nConfiguration management for the cloud.\n\n562\n00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.200\nBut the idea, the underlying assumptions,\nare still gonna be the same.\n\n563\n00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.500\nVery, very important to consider.\n\n564\n00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.512\n>> That's right.\nI always used to say,\n\n565\n00:28:43.512 --> 00:28:45.031\nI don't do anything without a work order,\nright?\n\n566\n00:28:45.031 --> 00:28:47.349\nI want to make sure this\nstuff is documented,\n\n567\n00:28:47.349 --> 00:28:49.970\nbecause it really is\nthere to help everyone.\n\n568\n00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.281\nMake sure that everything is getting\ndone as according to plan, right?\n\n569\n00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:57.050\nIf you don't implement good change\nmanagement, then it's just gonna be chaos.\n\n570\n00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.964\nPeople are gonna be doing something, and\nwhere did this switch come from, and\n\n571\n00:28:59.964 --> 00:29:00.980\nwhat is it connected to?\n\n572\n00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.970\nI have no idea, and okay, well,\nwe need to investigate this.\n\n573\n00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.860\nAnd maybe somebody did go in and\nlegitimately put a new switch in for\n\n574\n00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:08.990\na good reason.\n\n575\n00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:12.220\nBut maybe they didn't,\nmaybe somebody put it in and\n\n576\n00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.310\nthey're using company bandwidth to\nrun their BitCoin mining systems.\n\n577\n00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:20.550\nAnd that's probably not a good thing,\nso change management helps you.\n\n578\n00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.850\nI know it's helped me to\nkeep me out of the weeds.\n\n579\n00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:26.360\nI can show here is where\nI put it in the project,\n\n580\n00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.530\nit was approved,\nI did that approved change.\n\n581\n00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:32.780\nAnd now if it's not working,\nthen it's really not my fault.\n\n582\n00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.650\nThat's what you wanted me to do,\nso I did it.\n\n583\n00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.810\nSo it's definitely,\nit can be a double-edged sword.\n\n584\n00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:41.370\nIf you don't implement it correctly,\nit's just chaos around the office.\n\n585\n00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.920\nIf you do implement it correctly,\nevery step is monitored,\n\n586\n00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.510\nevery step is accounted for.\n\n587\n00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.700\nAnd you can find out really\nquickly if anything does go wrong,\n\n588\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:49.890\nwhere that happened.\n\n589\n00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.740\nI'm a big fan of change management.\n\n590\n00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.830\nAdam, obviously,\n\n591\n00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:57.140\nwe have a lot more to cover when it comes\nto this but our clock is ticking down.\n\n592\n00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.580\nSo we're gonna have to jump\ninto a part two on that.\n\n593\n00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.150\nWe look forward to seeing you there.\n\n594\n00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.010\n>> Okay\n>> We look forward to\n\n595\n00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.369\nseeing you there as well\n>> I\n\n596\n00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:05.490\nwas gonna tell you the secret of life,\nI had it.\n\n597\n00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.420\n>> That's a part two\n>> No, no, it's gone now.\n\n598\n00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:13.040\nIt was gonna be a part one or\nnothing, so unfortunately nothing.\n\n599\n00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.084\n>> Nothing you can do.\n\n600\n00:30:14.084 --> 00:30:15.985\n>> Just nothing you can do.\n>> Well, we missed our window ladies and\n\n601\n00:30:15.985 --> 00:30:18.320\ngentlemen, but hopefully we'll\nsee you anyway in part two.\n\n602\n00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.282\nAnd that being said,\nsigning off for ITProTV,\n\n603\n00:30:21.282 --> 00:30:23.610\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n604\n00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.340\n>> And\nI have not been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n605\n00:30:25.340 -->

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:21.464\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are moving forward with our,\n\n4\n00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:25.790\ndon't forget it, it is the Certified\nCloud Security Professional series.\n\n5\n00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.570\nJoining us back in studio again\nto help us out with that,\n\n6\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.920\ncontinuing on a little more on compliance,\nthat is our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.080\nAdam, welcome back, Sir.\n\n8\n00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.830\n>> How do, how do?\n\n9\n00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.915\n>> I do well.\n>> Or howdy.\n\n10\n00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:38.300\n>> [LAUGH] Or how do yourself.\n\n11\n00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.470\n>> Where you come from, how do, howdy.\n\n12\n00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.580\nHow do we do that.\n\n13\n00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.660\nSo lets talk about how we do that.\n\n14\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.906\nSo, we've been talking,\nwe will continue talking in this episode,\n\n15\n00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:49.220\npicking up from the theme of the last\none about compliance, about the ideal\n\n16\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.600\nframework, how it can bring it, as we\nhad our discussion, change management,\n\n17\n00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.080\nrisk management, IT service management,\nIT security, or information security\n\n18\n00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.240\nmanagement rather, and the importance\nof change and configuration management.\n\n19\n00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.980\nWe want to throw a quick\nbone out there for\n\n20\n00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.430\neverybody that is dealing with something\nthat, and I actually mentioned this in\n\n21\n00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.860\na separate episode, several episodes back,\nnot in this area but in general.\n\n22\n00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.043\nWe talked about the concept\nof the shadow IT, and\n\n23\n00:01:14.043 --> 00:01:17.396\nI made reference to the fact that we may\nhave, I think it was actually we were\n\n24\n00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:21.310\ntalking about application development\nsecurity on the platform with Cloud.\n\n25\n00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.070\nWe're talking about the fact you may\nsee app developers, for instance,\n\n26\n00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.830\nas one example cuz we like to pick\non them cuz you know they're just so\n\n27\n00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.780\neasy to make fun of.\n\n28\n00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.833\nSo application developers may go out and\nthey actually spin up instances on Amazon.\n\n29\n00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.085\nOn Microsoft [INAUDIBLE] whatever.\n\n30\n00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:37.465\nAnd not because they're\ndoing anything wrong.\n\n31\n00:01:37.465 --> 00:01:40.135\nRight we made it clear, not because\nthey're acting incorrectly, but\n\n32\n00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:43.815\nbecause they may just find it easier\nto do their development work there.\n\n33\n00:01:43.815 --> 00:01:47.245\nThat's not a bad thing, with a promise,\nA, it's unregulated work,\n\n34\n00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:49.915\nthat we don't have visibility\ninto as the organization.\n\n35\n00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:52.725\nIt is being run as\nparallel infrastructure,\n\n36\n00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:56.640\nthat may be connected back to our\norganization that we don't control.\n\n37\n00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.030\nAnd there's no record of it.\n\n38\n00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.190\nAnd yet, they'll go ahead and\nthey'll set it up.\n\n39\n00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.250\nThey'll probably expense it so\nwe'll pay for it, right?\n\n40\n00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.950\nBut we don't really know much about it.\n\n41\n00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.040\nWe call this shadow IT, and\nwe really have to be concerned with and\n\n42\n00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.200\nbe aware of the fact that shadow\nIT is a legitimate issue,\n\n43\n00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.470\na legitimate concern in the Cloud today.\n\n44\n00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.080\nIt was a concern prior to the Cloud,\nbut really not for the same reasons,\n\n45\n00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.100\nnot in the same way.\n\n46\n00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.340\nThe Cloud because of its definition,\nIts criteria,\n\n47\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.620\nthe five essential characteristics\nthat make the Cloud what it is and\n\n48\n00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.450\nthe fact that we have ambiguous access,\nbroad network availability.\n\n49\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.120\nWe have scalability\nthrough resource pooling.\n\n50\n00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.040\nWe have the ability to be\nable to pays as we go, right?\n\n51\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790\nAnd the ability to scale massively,\nelasticity, on-demand.\n\n52\n00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.660\nThese things make it so attractive for\nshadow IT to essentially exist and to\n\n53\n00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.400\npropagate through the Cloud because we can\naddress a lot of our resource concerns,\n\n54\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.535\na lot of our scalability concerns,\nby using the Cloud as a proxy essentially,\n\n55\n00:02:52.535 --> 00:02:56.185\na platform, to offset our\nlimitations inside the organization.\n\n56\n00:02:56.185 --> 00:02:58.035\nAll of that sounds great but\n\n57\n00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:00.565\nthen the problem is when you\nbring in the risk management.\n\n58\n00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:01.285\nThe compliance.\n\n59\n00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:03.755\nThe GRC, Governance, Risk Management,\nand Compliance activities.\n\n60\n00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:07.825\nYou bring in the security overlay,\nit is just incredibly problematic for\n\n61\n00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:10.795\nus, because you've got unregulated\ninfrastructure that is\n\n62\n00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:15.770\neither tied directly into our regulating\ninfrastructure or is referencing it and\n\n63\n00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.880\nit's moving down back and forth in\nsomeway and we have an out-of-band,\n\n64\n00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.940\nunregulated communication channel.\n\n65\n00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.570\nThis becomes a significant liability for\nus, with regards to the Cloud.\n\n66\n00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.720\nSo these can be a very,\nvery big issue for us.\n\n67\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.380\nSo wanna keep in mind as we continue\nour discussion around compliance,\n\n68\n00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.370\nthe back end concerns with\nregards to shadow IT as a CCSP.\n\n69\n00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.200\nThis is a scenario we have\nto spend a lot of time on.\n\n70\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.580\nAn area we need to focus on.\n\n71\n00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.360\nAn area that ultimately is directly\nrelated to risk management and\n\n72\n00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.540\nour ability to catalog and\n\n73\n00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.520\nunderstand risk is partly impacted\nby our ability to have visibility.\n\n74\n00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.020\nOur ability to have visibility.\n\n75\n00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.240\nSay that three times fast.\n\n76\n00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.660\nOur ability to have visibility\nin to the shadow world or\n\n77\n00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.110\nthe shadow IT world that may or\nmay not exist.\n\n78\n00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.640\nParallel to and lateral to our\norganizational infrastructure that we\n\n79\n00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.530\ndocument, we control and we understand\nthrough configuration management,\n\n80\n00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.600\nthrough lease and employment management,\nthrough change management.\n\n81\n00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.010\nThis may be that proverbial and\nliteral black hole that we hear so\n\n82\n00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.740\nmuch about that things escape into and\nwe don't ever see again.\n\n83\n00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.270\nThe problem is they do come\nout the other side, and\n\n84\n00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.370\nas a result of that at some point\nthey come back to haunt us.\n\n85\n00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.840\nSo we do have to understand\nthe impact of this.\n\n86\n00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.815\n>> Be the next Tom Clancy novel.\n\n87\n00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:26.005\n>> [LAUGH] Instead of Black Ops-\n>> Shadow IT, right?\n\n88\n00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:28.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> Shadow IT instead of Black Ops, or\n\n89\n00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.380\nShadow IT Black Ops, or\n>> Who knows what?\n\n90\n00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.237\nIt'll actually show up on Microsoft,\nprobably on X-Box.\n\n91\n00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:33.360\n>> [LAUGH] That's true.\n\n92\n00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.950\n>> In the new video game or\nsomething like that.\n\n93\n00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.100\nAll right, so\nsoftware installation policies and\n\n94\n00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.760\nconfiguration management, we know we have\nto be worried about this, we're talking\n\n95\n00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.230\nabout configuration management in our\nlast episode, the importance of it.\n\n96\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.740\nHow to walk through the changing\nconfiguration cycle.\n\n97\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.800\nActively managing all of the software that\nwe're installing through patch management,\n\n98\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.580\nthrough application deployment.\n\n99\n00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.540\nThis is part of what has to happen\nwith configuration management.\n\n100\n00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.290\nConfiguration baselines are not\njust about settings on a system.\n\n101\n00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.580\nThey're about the holistic\naspects of the system all up.\n\n102\n00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.160\nSo the hardware and\nthe software and the firmware.\n\n103\n00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.690\nFirmware is essentially\nconsidered part of software, but\n\n104\n00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.480\nit's just a lot better if we\ndifferentiate and specify all three.\n\n105\n00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.490\nBecause we have to be focused on this.\n\n106\n00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.910\nWe've talked about it in many\nof our prior discussions.\n\n107\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.840\nDealing with the firmware from\nthe patch management perspective,\n\n108\n00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.380\nas well as patch managing\nthe infrastructure itself.\n\n109\n00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.510\nThe desktop and\nthe software that runs there,\n\n110\n00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.100\nso want to always differentiate that.\n\n111\n00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.230\nI always want to call that out.\n\n112\n00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.810\nRight?\nBut\n\n113\n00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.730\nit's important to understand\nthat somebody adding or\n\n114\n00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.900\nremoving, or somehow modifying the\nexisting software has to be controlled.\n\n115\n00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.950\nAnd that's part of\na configuration management,\n\n116\n00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.080\npart of a changed management solution.\n\n117\n00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.410\nMany times In many of our organizations\nwhether it's a Cloud based solution or\n\n118\n00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.200\na non Cloud environment\nwe are running software\n\n119\n00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.680\nthat may require administrative access,\nadministrative privilege to run correctly.\n\n120\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.090\nA lot of times on the desk top for\ninstance this becomes an issue,\n\n121\n00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.260\nyou know I love when I go to\naudit writing companies and\n\n122\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.230\nI show up and we go through the process,\n\n123\n00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.860\nwe do the dances we often say, so I'll ask\nthe question that get me the responses and\n\n124\n00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.390\nI'll say okay great, we've talked\nthrough what you think everything is.\n\n125\n00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.560\nNow lets go actually put some rubber\nto the road and actually see.\n\n126\n00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.970\nWe'll go on a little tour, we'll go walk\naround, we'll take a look at things and\n\n127\n00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.900\nI'll sit down and\nI'll sample a user desktop.\n\n128\n00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.740\nI'll say hey,\nwhat's that computer over there?\n\n129\n00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.060\nThat's an average information\nworker's machine.\n\n130\n00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.190\nGreat log me onto that as\nan average information worker.\n\n131\n00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.690\nI want to see what I can see, and I'll sit\ndown and I'll start working with stuff.\n\n132\n00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.440\nAnd I'll very quickly realize that,\nand it's not hard to check and\n\n133\n00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.080\nfigure out, that I have admin\nrights to the desktop and\n\n134\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.860\nI wonder why do I have administrative\nrights to the desktop.\n\n135\n00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.380\nI don't wonder.\nI know, right?\n\n136\n00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.620\nWhat the answer is all ready.\n\n137\n00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.740\nBut in my mind as an auditor,\nI'm making a note.\n\n138\n00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.410\nI'm wondering why.\n\n139\n00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.030\nSo I have to ask you, right?\n\n140\n00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.750\nAs a customer why are you doing this?\n\n141\n00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.300\nI could fill in the blank for\nyou but I have to hear it from you.\n\n142\n00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.610\nSo you'll tell me,\nwell we have this piece of software,\n\n143\n00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.620\nthat's group of programs\nthat are gonna run.\n\n144\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.320\nI in order to install and to configure\nproperly we need administrative rights for\n\n145\n00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.150\nit to run.\n\n146\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:03.460\nSo instead of creating a new\neither an exception or\n\n147\n00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.970\nmodifying the run time, or\ndoing all the things we could do.\n\n148\n00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.470\nWe've essentially just given\nthe user full admin control\n\n149\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.675\nto allow it to run under\nthe user's log on.\n\n150\n00:07:11.675 --> 00:07:14.460\nOkay, well we're documenting that,\n\n151\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.450\nI'm not liking what I'm hearing, but\nI'm writing down what your saying.\n\n152\n00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.750\nSo then the next logical\nquestion comes up.\n\n153\n00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.470\nHave you documented this\nas an acceptable risk?\n\n154\n00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.670\nHave we captured this?\n\n155\n00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.190\nAre you aware of this and essentially\nhave you admitted to yourself and\n\n156\n00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.750\nto the business that\nyou're accepting the risk\n\n157\n00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.200\nof dealing with this software application\nby giving this user full admin rights.\n\n158\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.940\nAnd it's not just this user, by the way,\nit's everybody that runs the software.\n\n159\n00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.130\nSo essentially you've given every user in\nthe business full administrative rights,\n\n160\n00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.170\nnot just to their desktop, but to\nessentially any configurations that they\n\n161\n00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.440\nmay wanna change on their desktop in\norder to then run this piece of software.\n\n162\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.990\nAnd is that an acceptable risk, Mr.\nor Mrs. IT Manager?\n\n163\n00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.487\nAnd you know when we put it that way\nwhen we start talking to people about\n\n164\n00:07:57.487 --> 00:08:01.638\nit from that perspective That may change\nthe thought process because it's not just\n\n165\n00:08:01.638 --> 00:08:05.493\nabout running that piece of software it's\nabout what the user may choose to do\n\n166\n00:08:05.493 --> 00:08:06.501\neither purposely or\n\n167\n00:08:06.501 --> 00:08:10.240\nwithout knowing without realizing\nto other aspects of the system.\n\n168\n00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.800\nThey may decide to modify\nencryption settings,\n\n169\n00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.020\nthey may decide to change networking\nsettings, they may decide to uninstall\n\n170\n00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.560\nother pieces of software that\nare meant to keep the system secure.\n\n171\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.970\nThings like IPS or IDS agents,\nrunning locally, they may uninstall\n\n172\n00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.510\nvirus software, they may add their\nown version of virus software,\n\n173\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.270\nbecause I always use this so\nI'm going to download this.\n\n174\n00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.630\nWell that may or may not work, and\nit may or may not be appropriate, right?\n\n175\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.520\nSo we have to really\nthink about the fact that\n\n176\n00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.610\nSoftware installation policies can\nbe a very good way to manage this.\n\n177\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.180\nWe may want to use something\nlike AppLocker which is\n\n178\n00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:48.940\nessentially the software management\ncapability built into modern desktop and\n\n179\n00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.800\nserver operating systems.\n\n180\n00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.860\nSo it allows for whitelisting and\nblacklisting of apps and\n\n181\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.380\nallows them to have exceptions created,\naccount credentials applied, and for\n\n182\n00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.340\nyou to essentially run that\napp Under certain conditions.\n\n183\n00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.470\nBut to tightly control the execution and\nregulation of that app without giving\n\n184\n00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.060\nthe user the keys to the kingdom right,\nand opening up all the doors for them.\n\n185\n00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.970\nYou know this could be a significant\nissue, A really big problem.\n\n186\n00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.160\nAnd it doesn't abate,\nit doesn't go away by the way.\n\n187\n00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.670\nJust because we moved it into the cloud,\nif anything it's worse right, because if\n\n188\n00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.310\nwe're using the cloud to drive server\nside infrastructure or provision it.\n\n189\n00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.570\nAnd virtualize it then we may\nstill be using hard wired\n\n190\n00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.500\ninfrastructure that's\nphysical on the desktop but\n\n191\n00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.990\nnow we're connecting two different\nkinds of systems together.\n\n192\n00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.460\nWe may be using VDI, right?\n\n193\n00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.470\nDesktop that is running essentially\nthrough the cloud as virtual instances and\n\n194\n00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.770\nthat doesn't change or modify the desktop.\n\n195\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:42.650\nFrom the users perspective it's still\na desktop but how they get to it,\n\n196\n00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.860\nhow we provision,\nhow we control it is radically changed,\n\n197\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.760\nthe desktop is managed through\nthe cloud through VDI.\n\n198\n00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.230\nWe have a lot more control than if\nthe user has a physical instance\n\n199\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.630\nthat they are managing and\nthey are using that maybe not regulated,\n\n200\n00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.790\nnon managed to the same degree.\n\n201\n00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.590\nSo we have to really think about all these\nthings when we think about how we're going\n\n202\n00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:04.400\nto allow them potentially to occur\nthrough configuration management,\n\n203\n00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.150\nthrough release and deployment management.\n\n204\n00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.840\nThrough IT service management,\nthrough information security management\n\n205\n00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.250\nThrough change management,\nthrough risk managements.\n\n206\n00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.520\nI'm running out of managements\nto throw out there, right?\n\n207\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.880\nSo, all of these areas.\n\n208\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.580\nThis gets to be complicated,\nthis is why the CCSP\n\n209\n00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.180\nhas to understand all of these areas to\nencompass and envision and think through.\n\n210\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.650\nAnd wrestle in their mind then ultimately\ncome up with a solution in the enterprise\n\n211\n00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:32.310\nsecurity architecture both logical\narchitecture logical design and\n\n212\n00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.230\nphysical architecture physical design\nwith the answers to these questions,\n\n213\n00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.520\nbecause it's a multi faceted problem.\n\n214\n00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.720\nIt's not as simple as just saying\nwell we'll just do this give them\n\n215\n00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:43.660\naccess no big deal we\nwalk away we're done.\n\n216\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.280\nI mean it could be that simple and\nyou may make it that simple but\n\n217\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.020\nyou may be over simplifying and\nas a result may actually wind up just\n\n218\n00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.060\ndriving the cloud right into the cloud,\nright, and breaking it, essentially.\n\n219\n00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.140\nImagine breaking the cloud?\n\n220\n00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:57.560\n>> [LAUGH] That would be\nan interesting concept.\n\n221\n00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.031\n>> That would be like\nbreaking the Internet, right?\n\n222\n00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:00.590\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> I mean, that would be cool, but\n\n223\n00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.560\nit's-\n>> Can it be done?\n\n224\n00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.980\n>> I mean,\ndo you wake up in the morning going,\n\n225\n00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.800\ntoday I'm gonna blow up the Internet?\n\n226\n00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.440\nI don't know.\n\n227\n00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.070\nMaybe you do.\n\n228\n00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:06.700\nI'm not sure.\n\n229\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.640\nMaybe you do.\nIt's not me.\n\n230\n00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.630\nI don't know if you would.\n\n231\n00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.560\nBut I don't wake up in the morning\nthinking I'm gonna go out and\n\n232\n00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.730\nscrew the world.\n\n233\n00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.910\nAnd break the Internet or\ndrive the Cloud into the ground.\n\n234\n00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.110\nBut there are people out there,\n\n235\n00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.940\nin theory, without meaning to,\nthat can cause a lot of harm.\n\n236\n00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.570\nAnd there may be some people\nout there that mean to, but\n\n237\n00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.590\nwe wanna try to catch them and keep them\naway from our infrastructure I suppose.\n\n238\n00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.500\n>> I look forward to seeing you\nin the FISA court by the way.\n\n239\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.001\n[CROSSTALK] blow up the Internet.\n\n240\n00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:29.161\n>> Or we wanna hire them.\n\n241\n00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:31.073\nLike the FBI did to crack the iPhone.\n\n242\n00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:31.976\nWe wanna hire them.\n\n243\n00:11:31.976 --> 00:11:34.480\nI actually read an article\nabout that last dare.\n\n244\n00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.740\nSo they finally came out and\nare gonna talk about what they did.\n\n245\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.090\nThey actually just went out and\nfound a hacking group that was for\n\n246\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:43.150\nhire, that essentially for money would\ndo this, and they wrote a check and\n\n247\n00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:45.390\ngot them to come up with a way to do this.\n\n248\n00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.510\nThey showed them more or\nless the plans and the thought process.\n\n249\n00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.250\nThey, being the FBI, then went out and\nbuild a piece of hardware and they did it.\n\n250\n00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.030\nSo they-\n>> Did arrest them for breaking-\n\n251\n00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.760\n>> That would have been like\n\n252\n00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.387\nthe gold bar, right?\n\n253\n00:11:55.387 --> 00:11:56.980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think so, essentially, right?\n\n254\n00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.960\nSo if you can imagine the transition,\nhere's the hand holding the check and\n\n255\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.660\nhere's the other hand from\nthe side with the handcuffs.\n\n256\n00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.130\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> And\nas soon as you took the check\n\n257\n00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.220\n>> Right, the cuffs gone.\n\n258\n00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:08.150\nYou know, no, actually, apparently,\nthey, you know, said thank you, goodbye,\n\n259\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.360\nwent their separate ways,\nand I'm sure, from now on,\n\n260\n00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.076\ntheyre going to be\nthe subject of on going.\n\n261\n00:12:13.076 --> 00:12:15.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Reconnaissance and they'll never,\n\n262\n00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.806\never going to live\na normal life ever again.\n\n263\n00:12:16.806 --> 00:12:19.035\n[LAUGH] Yeah, but in theory anyway.\n\n264\n00:12:19.035 --> 00:12:20.095\nRight, that's what happened.\n\n265\n00:12:20.095 --> 00:12:23.085\nBut they essentially went out and\nbought the rights to that.\n\n266\n00:12:23.085 --> 00:12:25.305\nAlmost like going out to Best Buy or\nsomewhere and\n\n267\n00:12:25.305 --> 00:12:28.215\nbuying a piece of hardware off the shelf\nand saying that's what I want.\n\n268\n00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:32.802\nSo this brings up an interesting side with\nregards to the cloud and not so much for\n\n269\n00:12:32.802 --> 00:12:33.652\ncompliance per se,\n\n270\n00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:38.132\nbut since we're famous here for at IT Pro\nTV I thought I'd throw it in here anyway.\n\n271\n00:12:38.132 --> 00:12:41.982\nSo one of the big growth areas that we're\nseeing a lot of with regards to the cloud\n\n272\n00:12:41.982 --> 00:12:46.832\ntoday as a service is essentially\nyou can think of it as malware as\n\n273\n00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:50.850\na service you can think\nof it as threat a DOS or\n\n274\n00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.060\nDDS or botnets, there's all these\ndifferent ways that people refer to them.\n\n275\n00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.230\nBut essentially the idea of being\nable to buy or rent or, for\n\n276\n00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.590\na certain amount of money,\nuse these orbital cloud platforms for\n\n277\n00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:05.775\nattacking other networks as a service,\nright?\n\n278\n00:13:05.775 --> 00:13:09.415\nSo threat as a service is what\nit's often being referred to as.\n\n279\n00:13:09.415 --> 00:13:13.245\nWhere people are now just essentially\nselling their hacking abilities and\n\n280\n00:13:13.245 --> 00:13:16.745\ntheir anti-defensive capabilities or\noffensive capabilities for\n\n281\n00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:18.660\nthe highest bidder through the cloud.\n\n282\n00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.020\nYou can go onto certain\nwebsites on the dark web,\n\n283\n00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.880\nand essentially just like you do\nbuying Office 365 for 5 bucks for\n\n284\n00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:30.810\nemail per month, per user, you can\nbuy DDOS, or distributed search tax.\n\n285\n00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.580\nAgain, it's a variety of infrastructure\nper X number of dollars per incident.\n\n286\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.940\nSo it's actually, really the cloud is just\nconsuming everything in the sense that\n\n287\n00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.810\nit's both the good and potentially\nthe not so good the light and the dark.\n\n288\n00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.080\n>> Wow, that's kinda awesome cuz there\nare large bot nets out there and\n\n289\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.550\nif I wanted to and maybe we had\na competitor I could, like you said,\n\n290\n00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:53.060\nget on the dark net,\nfind somebody that was willing to.\n\n291\n00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:57.150\nFor the right amount of scratch there,\naAtack that network, bring them down,\n\n292\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:58.560\ngive them denial of service.\n\n293\n00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.710\nHey you know, ITPRO TV is always up,\nlet's jump over there.\n\n294\n00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:08.509\nThat's the kind of corporate espionage or\naggression that we see a lot.\n\n295\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.970\n>> It could be,\nit happens quite a bit, actually.\n\n296\n00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:15.830\nIt happens more than we talk about,\nit happens more than we hear about, but\n\n297\n00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.720\nit is happening and the cloud is\njust a logical extension of that.\n\n298\n00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.500\nInstead of the cloak and dagger of real\npeople running around stealing real\n\n299\n00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.750\nsecrets we have real people running\naround stealing real secrets but\n\n300\n00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.330\nthey're now using the cloud, essentially,\nto leverage that access point.\n\n301\n00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.070\nWhere not good as CCSP's\nat defending the border.\n\n302\n00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:34.110\nIf we're not good at\nkeeping out the bad people,\n\n303\n00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.990\nthey're gonna jump from\nplatform to platform and\n\n304\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.910\nuse our platforms to not only do damage to\nus but potentially do damage to others.\n\n305\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.090\nAnd this is a whole other side of this\nconversation we have to be aware of and\n\n306\n00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.430\nthink about as well.\n\n307\n00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.620\nWe have to think about the definition\nof events versus incidents here.\n\n308\n00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.190\nI ran through this at some point\nin one of the prior episodes but\n\n309\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.310\nI want to make sure we're\ncomfortable with this again and\n\n310\n00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.880\nreally make sure we\nunderstand the idea an event\n\n311\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:01.040\nis a some sort of an occurrence,\nsomething has happened, it's unclassified.\n\n312\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.160\nIt is not clear whether or\nnot it is good or bad, right?\n\n313\n00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.760\nIt is not clear, whether or not it is\nsomething that we have to address in some\n\n314\n00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.850\nway, through mitigation and\nrisk management and change management, or\n\n315\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.830\nwhether it's something of interest,\nof note, it's significant, but\n\n316\n00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:15.910\nwe're just gonna take note of it.\n\n317\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.520\nIt's gonna kinda go in the record\nbooks and we're gonna move on.\n\n318\n00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:23.370\nSo events are gonna be a change of state\nof some kind that is undetermined at\n\n319\n00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.500\nthe moment it happens, but is recorded\nfrom a monitoring perspective, so\n\n320\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.850\nbecause it is significant\nwe wanna know about it, but\n\n321\n00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.570\nwe have to classify it to understand\nits impact to the organization.\n\n322\n00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:38.700\nEvents that get classified as negatively\nimpacting us then grow up and\n\n323\n00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.040\nbecome incidents.\n\n324\n00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.324\nIncidents, in the language of ITIL and\nevent and incident and problem management,\n\n325\n00:15:44.324 --> 00:15:46.616\nare events that have\na negative occurrence,\n\n326\n00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:48.926\nnegative consequence to the organization.\n\n327\n00:15:48.926 --> 00:15:52.812\nBut are being seen for the first time,\nthis is something we have not seen before,\n\n328\n00:15:52.812 --> 00:15:56.378\nit is not something that is systemic,\nnot something that is repetitive.\n\n329\n00:15:56.378 --> 00:16:00.189\nNot something we have prior knowledge of,\nbut something that, at least based on\n\n330\n00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:04.340\nthe description and the classification,\nis unknown to us at the moment it happens.\n\n331\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:08.620\nBut we know clearly there is a significant\nliability, an impact, a concern and\n\n332\n00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.100\nwe wanna manage that by\npaying attention to it.\n\n333\n00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.960\nWe classify that as an incident.\n\n334\n00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.640\nAn incident is an event that has negative\nconsequence to the organization but\n\n335\n00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.580\none that we have no prior\nknowledge of happening,\n\n336\n00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:20.420\nprior to the time we actually see it.\n\n337\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.360\nWe have incident management capabilities.\n\n338\n00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.130\nGo out and essentially manage the\nincident, try to root cause analyze it,\n\n339\n00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:27.730\nfigure out what is at the heart at it.\n\n340\n00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:32.380\nAnd if we can mitigate, if we can correct\nit, if we can minimize its impact, do so.\n\n341\n00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:35.630\nIf we do so successfully,\ninstant it goes away,\n\n342\n00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:38.120\nwe're done, we write it up,\nwe learn from it.\n\n343\n00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.750\nWe put some changes in place, and\n\n344\n00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:43.490\nhopefully it doesn't happen again,\nend of story and of incident management.\n\n345\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.750\nHowever, if the incident is dealt with but\n\n346\n00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:51.950\nis not actually dealt with from\nthe perspective of root cause analysis and\n\n347\n00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.910\nreally getting down to the base\nassumption of what caused this incident,\n\n348\n00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.560\nwe don't in other words really\ntreat the root cause but\n\n349\n00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.430\nrather treat the symptoms as we often say,\nthe incident may occur again.\n\n350\n00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.540\nAnd incidents that occur repetitively,\n\n351\n00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.450\nthey become systemic,\nthey become ingrained in our system,\n\n352\n00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.110\nthey are coming back up over and over and\nover again, are no longer incidents but\n\n353\n00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:15.970\nrather now that they're known to us they\ngrow up again and become problems, and\n\n354\n00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:19.950\nproblems are incidents that have become\nsystemic and have not been solved.\n\n355\n00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:22.040\nSo, we haven't really route\ncause analyzed them properly,\n\n356\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.060\nbut we don't understand\nwhat's at the heart of them.\n\n357\n00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.210\nThat's incidents that essentially mature,\nright, and they become problems.\n\n358\n00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.390\nSo we wanna understand the definition\nof event, incident, and problem.\n\n359\n00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.730\nNow, if we understand all three,\nwe can then manage all three stages,\n\n360\n00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.540\nhopefully appropriately.\n\n361\n00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:41.690\nWe want to get it right before it gets to\nproblems, but if we don't get it right at\n\n362\n00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.000\nthe incident level, we will certainly\nget it right at the problem level.\n\n363\n00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.120\nIn order to solve an incident or a problem\nwe have to understand root cause.\n\n364\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:53.790\nWe have to truly get to the heart of what\nis causing this incident or this problem\n\n365\n00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:59.690\nto re-occur and then apply an appropriate\nchange that will address that concern.\n\n366\n00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:01.290\nSo the purposes of incident and\n\n367\n00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:05.650\nproblem management, restore normal service\noperation as quickly as possible, minimize\n\n368\n00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:10.150\nadverse impact on the business, ensure\nquality and availability are maintained.\n\n369\n00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.320\nHave incident response capabilities and\nsome management capabilities.\n\n370\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.050\nSounds suspiciously like BCDR.\n\n371\n00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:15.710\n>> It does.\n\n372\n00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.010\n>> When you think about it, right?\n\n373\n00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.060\nRestore service, minimize impact,\nmake sure we stabilize the environment,\n\n374\n00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:25.830\nget back to normal as quickly as possible,\nthat sounds a lot like what we do at BCDR,\n\n375\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.979\nBusiness Continuity Disaster Recovery,\nat least last time I checked.\n\n376\n00:18:29.979 --> 00:18:31.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sounds like, and\n\n377\n00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.170\nI'm pretty sure I know\nthat that's the case,\n\n378\n00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.400\nbecause that's what I tell people,\nand I must be right.\n\n379\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.110\nAnd so in fact, incidence response, right,\nproblem management, incident management\n\n380\n00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:44.890\nform the basis, really sit at the heart\nof what we are doing with BCDR.\n\n381\n00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.380\nIf you think about it, this is the exact\nkind of activity we have to engage in\n\n382\n00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:50.920\nwith regard to business continuity and\ndisaster recovery.\n\n383\n00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.170\nSo we wanna have a standardized method to\nrespond, a standardized method to analyze,\n\n384\n00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.500\nand a standardized way to apply a fix or\nthe patch or the workaround.\n\n385\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.800\nWhatever it may be that we are using,\nwhatever language we will use,\n\n386\n00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.310\nwe wanna maintain user\nsatisfaction as part of that.\n\n387\n00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.770\nBut ultimately we wanna restore service\nas quickly as possible, minimize\n\n388\n00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:15.380\nthe disruption to us, and maximize our\nability to provide service in the Cloud.\n\n389\n00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.770\nThis is all about the Cloud.\n\n390\n00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.890\nIncident management plans are helpful for\nthis.\n\n391\n00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.080\nWe have to define what the incidents that\nwe expect may be by service, by type or\n\n392\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.670\nby offering, and have a stepped\nset of plans to deal with them.\n\n393\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:30.430\nThis is a playbook, this may be\nour BCDR plan, for instance, and\n\n394\n00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:31.600\noften times it will be.\n\n395\n00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.020\nWe have to specify who's responsible for\nwhat.\n\n396\n00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.880\nSo we need to have roles well defined and\nresponsibilities well defined as well.\n\n397\n00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.390\nSo we need due care and due diligence.\n\n398\n00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.080\nAnd we need role definition and\n\n399\n00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.260\nwe need a clear understanding\nof who is gonna do what.\n\n400\n00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:47.470\nWe don't wanna call somebody up\nat 4 o'clock in the afternoon and\n\n401\n00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.100\nsay hey, are you available you're\nsuppose to be here to do this.\n\n402\n00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.470\nAnd they say what do you mean I have\nno idea what you're talking about.\n\n403\n00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.400\nSo we wanna make sure that we take\ncare of those things ahead of time.\n\n404\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:59.180\nWe have to make sure that we are thinking\nabout the incident from detection\n\n405\n00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.380\nall the way through\nresolution as a life cycle.\n\n406\n00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:03.310\nSo we have to manage\nthrough that life cycle.\n\n407\n00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.470\nWe have to have coordination for media and\n\n408\n00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.810\ncommunicating within internal and external\nsources, to ensure that we are speaking,\n\n409\n00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.590\nessentially, with one\nvoice as an organization.\n\n410\n00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:13.670\nNothing worse, right?\n\n411\n00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:17.900\nWell there are worse things, but\nmost things are not any worse than\n\n412\n00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.340\nhaving different spokespeople come out and\nsay different things on behalf of\n\n413\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.020\nan organization, delivering, essentially,\ndifferent sides of the same story.\n\n414\n00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.010\nWe don't wanna have confusion.\n\n415\n00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:32.070\nWhat we want to have is essentially\none voice, one process that we follow,\n\n416\n00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.760\none set of information items that\nare coming out that are consistent.\n\n417\n00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.640\nSo a lot of times when you see\nthese very large events occur,\n\n418\n00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:42.090\nwhether it's a police response\nbecause of some sort of an incident,\n\n419\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.450\nwhether it is a big breaking news story,\n\n420\n00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.900\nyou will typically have a spokesperson\nthat comes out for that organization.\n\n421\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.290\nThat will deliver the message,\nso to speak, right,\n\n422\n00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:52.030\nwhatever the standing message will be.\n\n423\n00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.420\nHey this is what we're doing, this is what\nhappened, whatever, it doesn't matter, but\n\n424\n00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.830\nyou've got a spokesperson.\n\n425\n00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:01.530\nYou may see 20 people on the stage, right\n,all grim faced and looking official but\n\n426\n00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.060\nthere's one person who comes out and\nessentially delivers the message.\n\n427\n00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.590\nSpeaks, answers questions and everybody\nelse is there, but really doesn't say much\n\n428\n00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:12.940\nbecause we wanna have one voice,\none story, one vision of the world.\n\n429\n00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.030\nIt's very important to keep that\nin mind as well as the CCSP.\n\n430\n00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.140\nOne of our jobs under due care and\ndue diligence,\n\n431\n00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:24.070\none of our responsibilities with regards\nto a system or a security breach,\n\n432\n00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.520\nis to ensure that we are speaking with\none voice to the organization's concerns.\n\n433\n00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.900\nInternally as well as externally.\n\n434\n00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.740\nWe don't allow individuals and\nunnamed sources.\n\n435\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.660\nI love when you hear that.\n\n436\n00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:36.970\n[LAUGH] Unnamed sources, right.\n\n437\n00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.459\nSomebody who doesn't want to admit in\npublic that they're willing to talk, but\n\n438\n00:21:40.459 --> 00:21:43.024\nhas a lot to say because they\nfeel they know all the answers,\n\n439\n00:21:43.024 --> 00:21:45.618\nthat's what an unnamed source\ntraditionally is, right?\n\n440\n00:21:45.618 --> 00:21:48.663\nAnd they play a very important role\ndon't wanna make light of that, but\n\n441\n00:21:48.663 --> 00:21:52.083\nthe reality is we don't wanna a lot of\nunnamed source just telling our stories.\n\n442\n00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:55.249\nWe wanna control the flow of information,\nwe wanna control the story so\n\n443\n00:21:55.249 --> 00:21:58.439\nthat everybody understands what\nthe appropriate information may be.\n\n444\n00:21:58.439 --> 00:22:01.075\nWe have to think about\nincident classification,\n\n445\n00:22:01.075 --> 00:22:03.971\nwe've done this where we\ndid our risk matrix, right.\n\n446\n00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:06.836\nWe looked at probability impact and\nexposure,\n\n447\n00:22:06.836 --> 00:22:10.860\nwe did likelihood I think cuz we\ndid a slightly different graphic.\n\n448\n00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.050\nCan you find that graphic,\ncan we put that up again at some point?\n\n449\n00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.280\nWe'll just take a look at that\nas soon as Daniel's ready, but\n\n450\n00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.820\nif you remember just in\nthe context of our conversation,\n\n451\n00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.300\nwe essentially were looking at\nhow likely something is to occur\n\n452\n00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:25.560\nwhen it does occur what's the potential\nimpact will be at the organization.\n\n453\n00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.760\nAnd as a result of that, how we then\nhave to grade or rank the risk,\n\n454\n00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.940\nright, there we go.\n\n455\n00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:34.070\nAnd we have to then look at either\nlikelihood and consequence, or\n\n456\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.360\nimpact and exposure, right.\n\n457\n00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.210\nAnd as a result of that, we can then see\nthe low, highly unlikely likelihood,\n\n458\n00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.060\nslightly harmful, the lower left,\ninsufficient risk or, excuse me,\n\n459\n00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.090\ninsignificant risk.\n\n460\n00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:48.565\nInsufficient risk,\nthat would be a cool one.\n\n461\n00:22:48.565 --> 00:22:49.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry, we don't have enough risk come\n\n462\n00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.860\nback tomorrow.\n\n463\n00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.950\nWe're out of risk come back tomorrow.\n\n464\n00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:55.445\n>> Fresh out.\nWe sold the last one just a minute ago.\n\n465\n00:22:55.445 --> 00:22:57.020\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah no more no more.\n\n466\n00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.630\nOr we have very high likelihood and\nthen we have very high impact or\n\n467\n00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.080\nvery harmful upper right\nhand corner of the matrix.\n\n468\n00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:06.110\nAnd we see that it is extreme risk right?\n\n469\n00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:07.610\nSo we have to be aware of that as well,\n\n470\n00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.360\nit's like the black diamond of risks,\nright?\n\n471\n00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.990\nIf you're a skier, I'm not a skier,\ncause I think the idea of\n\n472\n00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.430\nhurdling down the mountain on two\nsticks at that great rate of speed.\n\n473\n00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:19.550\nYou know if God had wanted me to do that,\n\n474\n00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.930\nhe would have made me into a mountain\ngoat, and I wouldn't have had skis,\n\n475\n00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.830\nbecause the idea that trees get in\nthe way of you, and they don't move.\n\n476\n00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.220\nRegardless of how hard you hit them,\nit's not a good thing,\n\n477\n00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:28.920\nas we were talking about.\n\n478\n00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.100\n>> They push back really well.\n\n479\n00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.680\n>> They actually are just, they're\nvery effective at stopping you, and\n\n480\n00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.430\nthey dissipate force very very quickly.\n\n481\n00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.670\nUnfortunately you tend to be\ndissipated along with the force.\n\n482\n00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.780\nSo that's not a good thing.\n\n483\n00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.400\nThat's actually how, not that I want to\nmake light of it, and certainly make fun\n\n484\n00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:45.970\nof it, cuz it's tragic when it happens,\nbut that's how Sonny Bono.\n\n485\n00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:47.410\n>> Yeah, that's right.\n>> If you remember actually died.\n\n486\n00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:51.044\nHe was skiing, was going down the hill and\nessentially for what ever happened.\n\n487\n00:23:51.044 --> 00:23:51.704\n>> Ran into a tree.\n\n488\n00:23:51.704 --> 00:23:54.634\n>> Ran into a tree and just essentially,\nbecause of the collision,\n\n489\n00:23:54.634 --> 00:23:57.044\nwound up killing himself,\nwhich is not a good thing.\n\n490\n00:23:57.044 --> 00:23:59.050\nOn any given day,\nthat's not what you want to do.\n\n491\n00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.333\n>> Avoid that.\n>> Not a good way to start out\n\n492\n00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:01.038\nMonday morning.\n\n493\n00:24:01.038 --> 00:24:02.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not on the top list.\n\n494\n00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.998\nPriority list of things we want to do\non a Monday, so make sure we understand\n\n495\n00:24:05.998 --> 00:24:09.027\nthe idea of classification,\nwe can apply that to incidents,\n\n496\n00:24:09.027 --> 00:24:12.490\nwe can apply it to risk any of those\nthings are very important, right?\n\n497\n00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.260\nSo when an incident occurs we want to\nthink about the concept, the logic of how\n\n498\n00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.600\nthe response should look, the incident\noccurs kind of stage one if you will, we\n\n499\n00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.740\nhave to report the incident somebody's got\nto find it, figure out how it happened.\n\n500\n00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.870\nTell the story initially and say hey\nDaniel, I think I've got an incident\n\n501\n00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:30.140\nhere I've got a problem something's\ngoing on can I tell you about it right?\n\n502\n00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.340\nWe've gotta classify it so\nsomebody's gotta look at it,\n\n503\n00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:35.760\nexamine it, figure it out, we have to\ninvestigate we have to collect data.\n\n504\n00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:39.400\nSo Daniel or somebody's gotta come\nalong and figure out what's going on.\n\n505\n00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.380\nWe've gotta resolve that in some way.\n\n506\n00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:44.070\nWe then gotta think about, okay,\nwell we think this will be good, so\n\n507\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.940\nwe'll try this.\n\n508\n00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:48.300\nWe've gotta get that approved, probably\nthrough a change management process.\n\n509\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.190\nWe then gotta implement that change,\nsee if it will actually work.\n\n510\n00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.370\nWe've got to review that and make sure\nthat it did work, or if it didn't we've\n\n511\n00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:00.020\ngot to go back unwind that right, so\nback that out and try something else.\n\n512\n00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.130\nSo we have to go through and\n\n513\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.350\nlogically think about the way in\nwhich instant response will work.\n\n514\n00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.230\nWe've talked about problem\nmanagement as being the next stop on\n\n515\n00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.730\nthe train here where incidents grow up.\n\n516\n00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.320\nAnd we've identified problems as incidents\nthat become systemic, and are repetitive\n\n517\n00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.620\nand are not root caused properly, and\nwe don't understand their impact and\n\n518\n00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.290\ntherefore they're cause for\nbeing the reasons.\n\n519\n00:25:19.290 --> 00:25:22.040\nAs a result of that, we're not\nquite clear on how to treat them.\n\n520\n00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.850\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nproblem as a definition.\n\n521\n00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.170\nProblem management is\nthe management of problems.\n\n522\n00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:31.240\nA known error in the language of ITEL\nis essentially an identified root cause\n\n523\n00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:31.750\nof a problem.\n\n524\n00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.190\nSo, we wanna know just the terminology and\n\n525\n00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.960\na work around is a temporary fix or\nsomething we apply to solve or\n\n526\n00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.400\ndeal with the technical difficulties\nassociated with the problem.\n\n527\n00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.250\nSo you want to just have knowledge of or\n\n528\n00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.160\nat least awareness of that\nparticular use of of vocabulary.\n\n529\n00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.150\nThat language in the IT world.\n\n530\n00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:50.630\nWe talked a lot about release and\ndeployment management.\n\n531\n00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.550\nThe idea of planning, scheduling,\ncontrolling the movement of\n\n532\n00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:57.290\ninformation and or\nthe application of something from a test.\n\n533\n00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.080\nUltimately to a live environment.\n\n534\n00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.180\nWant to make sure that think through and\n\n535\n00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.940\ndo our testing prior to\ngoing into deployment.\n\n536\n00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.620\nWe see that done in some sort of\nsandboxed area off to the side.\n\n537\n00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.560\nRemember in the cloud we have to\nbe thinking about the fact that we\n\n538\n00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.380\ncan easily spin up an environment\nto do this kind of work.\n\n539\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.880\nBut we have to be aware\nof the fact we need that.\n\n540\n00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.000\nAnd the cloud is no different\nthan anywhere else.\n\n541\n00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.660\nWe don't want a test in production.\n\n542\n00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.310\nIt's what's I often tell\nmy customers all the time.\n\n543\n00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:25.370\nIf you're testing in production,\nthen if anything goes wrong,\n\n544\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:26.600\nyou've got no back out.\n\n545\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.180\nThere's no where to go,\nbecause you're on the live system.\n\n546\n00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.380\nI've had customers talk\nto me in certain points.\n\n547\n00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.090\nWhat do you mean we have a QA environment,\n\n548\n00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.240\nwe deploy everything\ndirectly into production.\n\n549\n00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.280\nIf it doesn't work we figure it out\nafterwards and that may be nice and\n\n550\n00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.550\nthat may be okay and\nyou may feel that's appropriate.\n\n551\n00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:43.610\nI don't wanna work there.\n\n552\n00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.640\nThat may be okay for you or at least\nI don't wanna work there full time.\n\n553\n00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.260\nI'm perfectly fine with you\npaying me as a consultant.\n\n554\n00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:52.390\nto come and fix all those problems\nwhen those when those nice people\n\n555\n00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.350\ndeploy into production.\n\n556\n00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.210\nI have no trouble with that.\n\n557\n00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:57.410\nBut I don't want to be the one who's\nactually got to be there dealing with\n\n558\n00:26:57.410 --> 00:27:00.100\nthe fall out of that, because I can always\ndecide not to answer the phone, and\n\n559\n00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:02.030\nsay I'm busy that week,\nand I have no time.\n\n560\n00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.710\nRight?\nSo if I\n\n561\n00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:06.090\ndon't choose to solve your problems,\nI have that flexibility.\n\n562\n00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:09.140\nBut the reality is we don't wanna\never deploy into production directly.\n\n563\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.270\nWe wanna test into production directly.\n\n564\n00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.140\nWe wanna have a separate\nenvironment to do this.\n\n565\n00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:13.990\nIt's very important for\n\n566\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.550\nthe CCSP to understand the thought process\nhere, to really be aware of the fact,\n\n567\n00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:23.200\nright, that this is something that we have\nto instantiate as a risk management and\n\n568\n00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.280\na change management practice\nin the organization.\n\n569\n00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.720\nWe have to have separate environments.\n\n570\n00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.880\nChange management has to play a big\npart in this as does risk management.\n\n571\n00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.930\nSo release and\ndeployment management's role and\n\n572\n00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.490\nchange management how do we envision this?\n\n573\n00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.581\nLet's kind of summarizing\nwhat we're thinking about,\n\n574\n00:27:37.581 --> 00:27:40.260\nchange management approves\nthe request to carry out the release.\n\n575\n00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.430\nRelease and deployment management is\nable to schedule and execute that.\n\n576\n00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.750\nWhat is released in deployment management\nand incident and problem management?\n\n577\n00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.830\nHow do we see these two coming together?\n\n578\n00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:52.120\nIf anything were to go wrong with the\nrelease, we flip it over to incident and\n\n579\n00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.090\nproblem management,\nwhere we go to essentially back it out.\n\n580\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:59.360\nAnd then deal with the iterations of that\nto address whatever concerns there are.\n\n581\n00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.640\nWhat about release and deployment\nmanagement and configuration management?\n\n582\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.600\nOnce the release is essentially live\nin production, we have to document it\n\n583\n00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.330\nthrough configuration management,\nput it into the CMDB, update existing CIs,\n\n584\n00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:15.060\nadd new ones,\nmodify our configuration baselines,\n\n585\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:19.540\nmodify our continuous monitoring, and\nmake sure we are realigning it and\n\n586\n00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.860\ndealing with our new standard,\nif you will, to create the new normal.\n\n587\n00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:25.540\nWhatever whatever the new normal is.\n\n588\n00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.230\nWhen we think about releasing deployment\nmanagement and visibility in management.\n\n589\n00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:32.720\nIf the release were not to go as planned\nas we said, we're going to back that out.\n\n590\n00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:36.450\nWe may have to use SLAs to\nunderstand how to manage that So\n\n591\n00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:37.940\nwe'd have to reference those.\n\n592\n00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:43.020\nWe may have to go to a change management\nprocess as well as a business\n\n593\n00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:47.020\ncontinuity or disaster recovery capability\nbecause maybe now we've broken something,\n\n594\n00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:50.150\nand we may not be able to restore it\nwithin the sufficient boundary or\n\n595\n00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.470\nwindow of RTO and MTD.\n\n596\n00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.800\nSo we now have a problem with that.\n\n597\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.510\nWe may have to worry about RPO and\n\n598\n00:28:55.510 --> 00:28:57.110\nthe amount of data that we're gonna lose,\nright?\n\n599\n00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.400\nBecause of the RPO\ncriteria we've set aside.\n\n600\n00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.056\nSo we have to think about all these.\n\n601\n00:29:01.056 --> 00:29:04.850\nSo release and deployment management is\ngonna spiderweb into all these other areas\n\n602\n00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.760\nand really help us to understand\nwhat these things are doing and\n\n603\n00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:14.040\nhow we're gonna manage this change and\nthis, what's the analogy I'm looking for?\n\n604\n00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:18.270\nSo if you drop, if you think if you\ndrop like a rock into a body of water,\n\n605\n00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.760\nthe rippling waves that go\nout from the center, right,\n\n606\n00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.170\nessentially there's cascading waves.\n\n607\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:24.608\nYou know we're thinking about something\nlike that because release and\n\n608\n00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:28.080\ndeployment management is touching all of\nthese different areas as it moves through\n\n609\n00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.210\nthe organization.\n\n610\n00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:31.800\nWhat about the help desk or\nthe service desk up front?\n\n611\n00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.980\nThis is our point of communication,\nand our coordination element.\n\n612\n00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.900\nHow we're gonna communicate with all\nof our users, how we're gonna announce\n\n613\n00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:42.570\nany service outages, how we're gonna\nupdate them as to what we're doing.\n\n614\n00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.160\nSo we are gonna have to\nthink about all this.\n\n615\n00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.687\nRemember, any changes, any modifications\nto configurations, not just configuration\n\n616\n00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:52.439\nmanagement involved there, but\nservice level management as well, SLM,\n\n617\n00:29:52.439 --> 00:29:55.910\nbecause our SLA's our service level\nagreements have to be updated.\n\n618\n00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:58.520\nIf we don't agree, or rather,\nif we don't modify and\n\n619\n00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.610\nunderstand we have to change those\nwe're going to run into an issue.\n\n620\n00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:04.500\nAnd so service level management\nbecome very important as well.\n\n621\n00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.580\nWe are essentially managing the service\nlevels in the organization, we're managing\n\n622\n00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.390\nthe creation, the ongoing maintenance and\nthe monitoring of the SLA's.\n\n623\n00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.870\nWe wanna think about OLAs,\noperational level agreements.\n\n624\n00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.050\nWe've talked about these.\n\n625\n00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.070\nThese are internal facing SLAs\nnegotiated between business units\n\n626\n00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.700\ninside of the company.\n\n627\n00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.110\nSo if we are the IT provider in\nthe company doing on-prem private cloud,\n\n628\n00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.920\nwe will have OLAs with our\nbusiness units for service.\n\n629\n00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.800\nWe will have an SLA with\nan external cloud provider.\n\n630\n00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.750\nWanna make sure we understand the\ndifference and an underpinning contract,\n\n631\n00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:39.390\nthe other language item we see a UC\nunderpinning contract is essentially just\n\n632\n00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:42.560\na contract that's signed with an external\nvendor, but we do wanna understand that\n\n633\n00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.945\nthat's the formal language that you may\nbe asked about on an exam at some point.\n\n634\n00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:50.825\nRemember, service level management and\nchange management also very important.\n\n635\n00:30:50.825 --> 00:30:52.865\nWe have to think about the tie in there.\n\n636\n00:30:52.865 --> 00:30:54.895\nUnderstanding how SLAs and\n\n637\n00:30:54.895 --> 00:30:56.725\nchange management have to\ncoordinate with each other.\n\n638\n00:30:56.725 --> 00:30:58.215\nOr service level management and\n\n639\n00:30:58.215 --> 00:31:01.415\nchange management has to coordinate\nwith each other to coordinate\n\n640\n00:31:01.415 --> 00:31:05.760\nthe use of the SLAs, the updating of them,\nthe application of them to our systems.\n\n641\n00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.970\nAvailability management\nalso very important.\n\n642\n00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.380\nMaking sure systems are online\nwhen they need to be.\n\n643\n00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.410\nMaking sure we can scale when we need to.\n\n644\n00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.280\nThe SLA's are gonna be involved here.\n\n645\n00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.900\nCapacity management,\nwe have enough scalability so\n\n646\n00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.230\nthe elasticity of the cloud is\nwhat we are thinking about here.\n\n647\n00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.280\nEnough IT services,\n\n648\n00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.520\nenough IT infrastructure to be able\nto run the systems that we need.\n\n649\n00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.210\nWe have to run incorporate all\nof these thought processes.\n\n650\n00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:33.190\nAll of these systems, all of these\nservices into our existing business cycles\n\n651\n00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:36.610\nand into our existing thought\nprocesses currently in the system,\n\n652\n00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.830\nin the model, in the organization around\nhow we are managing infrastructure.\n\n653\n00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.897\nOne of the biggest challenges most of\nmy customers face is the ability and\n\n654\n00:31:44.897 --> 00:31:48.765\nthe understanding of how to actually\nbridge the gap between what they\n\n655\n00:31:48.765 --> 00:31:51.979\ncurrently do and\nwhat they are looking to do in the cloud.\n\n656\n00:31:51.979 --> 00:31:55.198\nThey have a lot of this infrastructure\nmanagement, a lot of these things\n\n657\n00:31:55.198 --> 00:31:58.579\navailable to them continuity management\nis there, capacity management,\n\n658\n00:31:58.579 --> 00:32:02.048\navailability management, but the problem\nis it's not scaled to the cloud.\n\n659\n00:32:02.048 --> 00:32:05.210\nAnd when they move to the cloud they\ndon't understand how to link that.\n\n660\n00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:08.448\nTo an outsourced third party\nprovider relationship with that CSP,\n\n661\n00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:09.924\na cloud service provider, and\n\n662\n00:32:09.924 --> 00:32:14.200\nthey lose sight of the fact that they have\nto still pay attention to these details.\n\n663\n00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.480\nAnd so we come back to this\nidea of risk management.\n\n664\n00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.040\nBecause the biggest risk,\n\n665\n00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.720\none of the biggest risks we\nhave in moving to the cloud,\n\n666\n00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.050\nis that we advocate our responsibilities\nunder due care and due diligence.\n\n667\n00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.560\nWe don't pay attention to them,\nwe don't understand the demarcation line\n\n668\n00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.310\nfrom what we are expected to do, and\nwhat the cloud providers expect it to do.\n\n669\n00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:34.930\nAnd if we don't clearly understand that,\nwe're gonna have a problem.\n\n670\n00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.280\nWe need to understand this is continuity,\nas we've talked about in a prior episode.\n\n671\n00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.750\nWe need to understand this is\ncontinuity management, and\n\n672\n00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:45.230\nour focus inside the organization is\ngonna be how to make sure we maintain\n\n673\n00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:46.850\nthe availability of these services, right.\n\n674\n00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:50.070\nThat's what we do, try to get back\nto normal, try to stay online and\n\n675\n00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:54.180\ndo all the stuff we've got to\ndo in the face of adversity.\n\n676\n00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.400\nIf we can do that, great.\n\n677\n00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.860\nIf we can't, how long it's going\nto take to get back there?\n\n678\n00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.110\nBut, is the cloud provider\ngoing to play a part in that?\n\n679\n00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.700\nAre we going to do that ourselves?\n\n680\n00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:04.560\nWhat's our continuity manner for\nplan look like in other words?\n\n681\n00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.378\nWe've got to update that for the cloud.\n\n682\n00:33:06.378 --> 00:33:09.775\nA lot of times we'll have the disaster,\nthis is continuity plans we've talked\n\n683\n00:33:09.775 --> 00:33:13.375\nabout and we've talked about testing it\nright, and how often we should do that.But\n\n684\n00:33:13.375 --> 00:33:17.021\nif we don't update it for the cloud, if we\ndon't add new services to it, if we're not\n\n685\n00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:20.298\nreflecting the current state of\nthe technology, we're not doing our job.\n\n686\n00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:21.653\nIt's not gonna be a good thing for\n\n687\n00:33:21.653 --> 00:33:24.470\nus right we're gonna have a problem\nthere it's gonna be a big issue.\n\n688\n00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.970\nAgain, one of the big concerns\nI often have, I often see,\n\n689\n00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:34.170\nwith customers in the field, is that they\nmove to the cloud over a very short period\n\n690\n00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.720\nof time and\nthey don't update their documentation.\n\n691\n00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.100\nThey don't update their planning cycles.\n\n692\n00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.250\nThey don't update their thought\nprocesses with regards to managing\n\n693\n00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:44.310\nbecause they think just cuz they moved to\nthe cloud that all that stuff is going to\n\n694\n00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.990\nbe handled by the cloud vendor.\n\n695\n00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.030\nAnd as a result, they don't have to do\nanything other than write a check, and\n\n696\n00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:51.500\nyou know, log on every day or\nwhatever it is.\n\n697\n00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.460\nAnd quite the opposite as we've seen and\nwe've established is the case.\n\n698\n00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.030\nWe have to do a lot more\nthan just write a check.\n\n699\n00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:58.230\nWe have to do a lot more than just log on,\nand\n\n700\n00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:01.750\nif we're not clear in our minds\nas CCSP as to what that is.\n\n701\n00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:05.340\nIf we don't have a continuous service\nimprovement cycle, a continuous feedback\n\n702\n00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.790\nloop, that brings this information back\ninto the organization, cycles it through\n\n703\n00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.630\nout systems, allows us to learn from\nthe mistakes that we make and others make,\n\n704\n00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:17.000\nand allows us to,\nas the vendor updates their offerings,\n\n705\n00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.530\nupdate our expectations and sync the two,\nwe're gonna have a significant breakdown.\n\n706\n00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:24.740\nAnd somewhere, somehow, someway,\nwe're gonna run into a problem.\n\n707\n00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.330\nIt's gonna lead us ultimately\ninto risk and risk management.\n\n708\n00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.890\nWe're gonna talk about that in an upcoming\nepisode here in just a few minutes.\n\n709\n00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:34.110\nI invite you to come back, obviously,\nand take that journey with us.\n\n710\n00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.630\nWe've talked about risk already.\n\n711\n00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:39.560\nWe'll review and remind you of that and\nadd a couple of new twists and turns.\n\n712\n00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.370\nOn to that story, but it's gonna\nbe the same old story primarily.\n\n713\n00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.240\nIt's gonna be the fact that if we're\nnot paying attention to the details,\n\n714\n00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.080\nthe things that we know\nwe have to control,\n\n715\n00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.780\nwe're gonna invite risk\ninto the organization.\n\n716\n00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.620\nAnd with it come the bad actors.\n\n717\n00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.440\nAnd as a result of that all the things\nthat we're trying to stop essentially,\n\n718\n00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.160\nnow happens.\n\n719\n00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.490\nSo we have to be aware of that as well.\n\n720\n00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:58.190\n>> Yeah, well the good news\nis we've looked at a lot of\n\n721\n00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:59.460\ndifferent management systems.\n\n722\n00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:03.030\nThey're gonna help keep that from being\na real problem, to help manage our risk.\n\n723\n00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.690\nAnd that's really what it comes down to,\n\n724\n00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:08.460\nat least it seems to, the end of the day\nis that we're trying to mitigate\n\n725\n00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.530\nas much of the risk that is out\nthere against us as possible.\n\n726\n00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.830\nAnd try to just keep our\nsystems secure and safe.\n\n727\n00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:19.010\nAnd obviously we have a lot of\nregulations and controls and\n\n728\n00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.360\nagain these management systems that\nare in placed to help us do that.\n\n729\n00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.150\nSo you need to be familiar with them.\n\n730\n00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:28.220\nTake some time or\nyou spend some of your hourly or\n\n731\n00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.560\nyour hours in the day and\nreally learn these things.\n\n732\n00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.000\nGet them acclimated in to your own person,\nso\n\n733\n00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.870\nthat when you're actually in it, it starts\nto make a whole lot more sense, and\n\n734\n00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.160\nit's not just theoretical,\nyou say that's why we do it.\n\n735\n00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.490\nThat's what he was talking about when he\nwas talking about release management.\n\n736\n00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.560\nThat makes sense now.\n\n737\n00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.880\nAnd that's the whole purpose\nof us going through these.\n\n738\n00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:48.640\nAdam, we thank you for\n\n739\n00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.950\nthat Tour De Force of all of these\ndifferent management systems.\n\n740\n00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:53.440\nWe do thank you guys for watching.\n\n741\n00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.140\nBut we are gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n742\n00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:57.630\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n743\n00:35:57.630

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.300\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we are continuing forward with our\n\n4\n00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.790\ncertified cloud security\nprofessional series.\n\n5\n00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.360\nJoining us back in the studio again for\n\n6\n00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.805\na little more of that action\nit's our good friend.\n\n7\n00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:27.410\nMr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.510\nAdam, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.922\n>> That's me being a bright and sunny--\n\n10\n00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:32.446\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cloud-less day.\n\n11\n00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:33.850\n>> It's a bright morning.\n\n12\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.929\n>> It's going well.\n\n13\n00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:39.994\nSo, we're going to talk a little bit about\nsome of the operational aspects of cloud\n\n14\n00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:41.470\nand cloud security.\n\n15\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.990\nIn this group of shows in these episodes,\nwanna focus on how\n\n16\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.740\nthe CCSP's gonna take all the information\nwe've talked about up until now, and\n\n17\n00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.690\nwe're going to take it into the data\ncenter, we're gonna talk about building\n\n18\n00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.230\nthe data center, we've talked about\nit in some our prior episodes.\n\n19\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.890\nWe'll review that,\nour thought-process a little bit with you.\n\n20\n00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.045\nWe'll talk about the do's and\n\n21\n00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:04.190\ndont's there,\nwe'll talk about the infrastructure.\n\n22\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.790\nHow we virtualize what\nthe hypervisors need to be doing.\n\n23\n00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.470\nHow we can check on security through\nthe hypervise using cool technology called\n\n24\n00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.500\nVMI, virtual machine introspection, so\nwe'll take a look at some of that stuff,\n\n25\n00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.040\nwe'll talk about how to manage risk yet\nagain.\n\n26\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.710\nBecause we've talked about\nrisk in almost every area and\n\n27\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.035\nalmost every episode of show at some\npoint we mention it If we don't,\n\n28\n00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:26.601\nthen Daniel whispers, hey you forgot risk.\n\n29\n00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:27.185\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n30\n00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:28.565\nwe always throw it out there somewhere.\n\n31\n00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:31.405\nSo risk is ever present,\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n32\n00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:34.115\nWe're gonna talk a bit about [INAUDIBLE],\nbring in some of the thought\n\n33\n00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:37.862\nprocesses around the service management\nframework, and how, the CCSP.\n\n34\n00:01:37.862 --> 00:01:41.272\nWe need to be focused not just\non the physical security,\n\n35\n00:01:41.272 --> 00:01:45.042\nnot just on the logical security, not just\non the policy or the administrative or\n\n36\n00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:48.222\ntechnical aspects of security but\nwe have to be thinking about\n\n37\n00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:52.492\nhow we provide service to our customers\nif we are a service provider.\n\n38\n00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:56.207\nIf we are the customer, we\nare the enterprise and we're working with\n\n39\n00:01:56.207 --> 00:02:00.371\na service provider how we are still gonna\ninteract with and ultimately insert\n\n40\n00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:04.876\nourselves into the discussions around\nservice and around framework management.\n\n41\n00:02:04.876 --> 00:02:08.201\nFrom change management, incident and\nproblem management, release and\n\n42\n00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.950\ndeployment management,\nconfiguration management.\n\n43\n00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.135\nStop me when I get warm.\n\n44\n00:02:12.135 --> 00:02:13.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Availability management,\n\n45\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.300\nI could go on all day,\nany and all of these things.\n\n46\n00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.100\n>> Management management.\n\n47\n00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.000\n>> Management management,\nmanagement of management.\n\n48\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.920\nSo we're gonna talk about all that.\n\n49\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.980\nAnd a lot more over the course\nof our discussions and\n\n50\n00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.850\nour episodes here in the operational area.\n\n51\n00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.930\nBut to begin, and to talk about first,\nprobably the bedrock area,\n\n52\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.760\nthe ground floor, if you will,\nof the operational thought process.\n\n53\n00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.170\nWe have to start with the data center.\n\n54\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.380\nWe have to think through the logic of\nwhere we're gonna put all of our stuff.\n\n55\n00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.100\nYou know, when I was growing up as a kid,\nas most kids do, have a lot of toys.\n\n56\n00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.960\nYou got little toys floating around\nall over the place in the house,\n\n57\n00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.420\nin the apartment, wherever you grow up and\nI had a younger brother,\n\n58\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.700\nfour years younger than me.\n\n59\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.410\nAnd so, together we had a lot of toys.\n\n60\n00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.140\nAnd so,\nI remember constantly growing up, me and\n\n61\n00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.910\nmy brother like all kids do,\nyou leave stuff laying around.\n\n62\n00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.280\nYou don't clean up after yourselves to\nthis day, I don't clean up after myself,\n\n63\n00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.880\nso why would it be any\ndifferent when I was a kid?\n\n64\n00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.100\nBut you leave all your stuff lying\naround and so at one point I remember,\n\n65\n00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.650\nwe got a toy box or a chest or\nsomething like that,\n\n66\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.590\nwhatever you would think that would be,\nto put all the stuff in basically.\n\n67\n00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.550\nAnd so the thought process was, well\nif you put all the toys in the toy box,\n\n68\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.820\nyou take them out to play with them.\n\n69\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.070\nYou put them back,\nthen they're not everywhere.\n\n70\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.410\nYou know, that lasted all of five\nminutes cuz the toy box was cool.\n\n71\n00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.870\nSo, you know,\nyou could build a blanket fort out of it.\n\n72\n00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.130\nYou know, you could put your little\nbrother in there and put stuff on it and\n\n73\n00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.050\nthen he wouldn't be able to get out.\n\n74\n00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.850\nSo, you know, you would empty the toy box.\n\n75\n00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.410\nYou would put other stuff in there,\nbut the toys would wind up not living\n\n76\n00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.410\nright where you told them\nthey were supposed to go.\n\n77\n00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.560\nAnd so the idea of building\na containerized area, in this case,\n\n78\n00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.980\na data center where we're gonna put\nall of our cloud infrastructure,\n\n79\n00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.500\nmakes a lot of sense.\n\n80\n00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.220\nBut it only makes a lot of sense if we\nset up rules, process policy procedure,\n\n81\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.010\nif we train our people, if we educate\nthem, if we educate our users.\n\n82\n00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.980\nIf, as a cloud service provider, we're\nvery specific with our customers about\n\n83\n00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.410\nwhat expectations will be about where\nstuff lives, in other words, right we\n\n84\n00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.410\ngotta tell everybody where we're gonna put\nour stuff and where their stuff should be.\n\n85\n00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.600\nSo they understand essentially\nwhat the rules of the game are and\n\n86\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.780\nhow to make sure that they clean\nup right after themselves,\n\n87\n00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.230\ndon't put data in other areas\nit's not gonna be as secure.\n\n88\n00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.860\nIt should be in this area specifically\nin your little multi tenant, isolated\n\n89\n00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.300\ntenant portion of that environment\nwhere we're gonna stick your stuff, so\n\n90\n00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.928\nthat nobody else sees it and essentially\nyou don't see other people's stuff, right?\n\n91\n00:04:35.928 --> 00:04:40.550\nYou know, hands off, play with your stuff\nbut don't play with anybody else's stuff.\n\n92\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.680\nAnd that's really the thought process\nbehind building a data center,\n\n93\n00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.580\nbecause If there is an individual\ncompany running private cloud on-prem,\n\n94\n00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.430\nwe may already own infrastructure\nthat is datacenter-like.\n\n95\n00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.810\nWe may have a NOC,\na network operations center.\n\n96\n00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.390\nWe may have an EOC,\nan emergency operations center.\n\n97\n00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.500\nThey're called different things.\n\n98\n00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.210\nEssentially, You've gotta\nspace somewhere right,\n\n99\n00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.505\nwhere you've got a bunch of machines,\nyou've got power, you've got cabling.\n\n100\n00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:09.000\nYou've probably got HVAC, and you've\ngot all the stuff that you would need.\n\n101\n00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.120\nWhether it's a small wiring closet.\n\n102\n00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.840\nYou know we talked about that.\n\n103\n00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.070\nWhole data center closet thing in the\nhotel right in one of our prior episodes\n\n104\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.900\nwhere they have them on the floors now.\n\n105\n00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.590\nSo you know it's a small room, not very\nbig, but it just handles the wiring,\n\n106\n00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.620\nthe switching and all that for\nyou know the 30 rooms or whatever it is,\n\n107\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.530\n40 rooms up on that floor.\n\n108\n00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.180\nSo it's a miniature little wiring closet,\n\n109\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.350\nsinks back to probably ultimately some\nmaster bus lines down to the ground floor,\n\n110\n00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.370\nback to wherever the data closet\nis on the ground floor, right.\n\n111\n00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.930\nAnd that's not really a data center,\n\n112\n00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.370\nit's just really a small\nlittle infrastructure area.\n\n113\n00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.070\nBut in it's own way,\nit's where we put all the infrastructure.\n\n114\n00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.310\nIt may be bigger, right?\n\n115\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.990\nWe may have a group of servers that we\nhave to put somewhere, some routers,\n\n116\n00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.070\nsome switches.\n\n117\n00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.990\nSo we maybe have 30, 40,\n50 square feet of space in a building.\n\n118\n00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.800\nBut we may actually have thousands,\n\n119\n00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.480\ntens, hundreds of thousands of square\nfeet dedicated to this as well.\n\n120\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.332\nAnd so it really just depends\non the size of the organization,\n\n121\n00:06:04.332 --> 00:06:08.551\nmany of my customers prior to going\nto the cloud for years now prior to\n\n122\n00:06:08.551 --> 00:06:13.386\nthe cloud have had their own little\ndata centers in their buildings, right?\n\n123\n00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:16.525\nBecause they will setup and\nrun their own infrastructure,\n\n124\n00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:19.851\nthat's been the traditional model for\nmany many years, and so\n\n125\n00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:23.052\nthey're able to take that space and\neither convert it over,\n\n126\n00:06:23.052 --> 00:06:27.508\nif they do IT on-prem based private cloud,\nor, they're able to essentially empty\n\n127\n00:06:27.508 --> 00:06:30.497\na lot of the infrastructure\nout of that space over time.\n\n128\n00:06:30.497 --> 00:06:32.780\nBecause as they go to the cloud,\na lot of the machines,\n\n129\n00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.020\nthe physical machines that would have\nbeen there, are no longer necessary.\n\n130\n00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.980\nThey're probably now gonna\nbe either repurposed, so\n\n131\n00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.380\nwe tend to see them being recycled, reused\nfor other things, killer media streaming,\n\n132\n00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.880\nand killer gaming platforms get built when\nyou have all these servers laying around.\n\n133\n00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.030\nSo you've got all the infrastructure.\n\n134\n00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.325\nYou don't really do that, I'm kidding.\n\n135\n00:06:50.325 --> 00:06:51.307\n>> [CROSSTALK] don't.\n>> You shouldn't do that, well.\n\n136\n00:06:51.307 --> 00:06:53.107\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I do.\n\n137\n00:06:53.107 --> 00:06:54.151\nShouldn't do that, right?\n\n138\n00:06:54.151 --> 00:06:56.957\nIf you do it, don't tell the boss because\nthat's not the proper use for that ticket.\n\n139\n00:06:56.957 --> 00:06:58.258\n>> Keep that on the down low.\n\n140\n00:06:58.258 --> 00:07:03.590\n>> Got he, you remember,\nyou have the boss key all the time.\n\n141\n00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.000\nSo you know the boss\nkey is the concept of,\n\n142\n00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.870\nyou like being in exchange,\nbeing in Excel or something working.\n\n143\n00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.070\nAnd you're really video gaming or\nsomething, you see these commercials and\n\n144\n00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.920\nstuff all the time.\n\n145\n00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.950\nSo the boss walks up and you hit\nthe key and up pops the spreadsheet but\n\n146\n00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.130\nyou're playing Doom or\nsomething behind the scenes.\n\n147\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:19.630\nSo you don't wanna tell the boss,\n\n148\n00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.260\nmake it look like it's a normal rack\nof servers but you know better right?\n\n149\n00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.550\nSo whatever you're gonna do, right,\nwe may repurpose that infrastructure but\n\n150\n00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.460\nwe may also wind up remember just\nconverting it into cloud hosting on-prem.\n\n151\n00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.420\nSo data centers are really not that\nfarfetched today, in the sense that\n\n152\n00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.870\nmost companies already own the generic\nconcepts of the infrastructure.\n\n153\n00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.410\nWe may not be talking about building\na 250,000-square-foot co-location\n\n154\n00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.500\nhosting facility.\n\n155\n00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.520\nWe're talking about 500 square feet\nin your building that you dedicate to\n\n156\n00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.430\nthis infrastructure.\n\n157\n00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.170\nAnd you put a door on the front of it so\n\n158\n00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.440\nnobody can walk in unless\nthey belong there.\n\n159\n00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.315\nAnd you make sure you got enough\nair conditioning and some power and\n\n160\n00:07:56.315 --> 00:07:57.868\nyou got a sense of what's going on.\n\n161\n00:07:57.868 --> 00:08:00.838\nAnd that could be a mini datacenter,\nit doesn't have to be more than that.\n\n162\n00:08:00.838 --> 00:08:04.178\nSo as we talk about this and\nreally get started with this.\n\n163\n00:08:04.178 --> 00:08:06.040\nWhat I wanna make sure you'd understand,\n\n164\n00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.168\nis that when we talked\nabout cloud data centers.\n\n165\n00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:11.743\nYeah, we're primarily talking about\nthese monstrously large hosting\n\n166\n00:08:11.743 --> 00:08:12.945\nenvironment, right?\n\n167\n00:08:12.945 --> 00:08:18.470\nWhere you've got just row after row of\nthese servers, and you've got millions of\n\n168\n00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.280\ncustomers, right, running infrastructure\nin these massive data centers.\n\n169\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.940\nThat's the traditional\ndata center in the cloud.\n\n170\n00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:29.370\nBut it could very well be just\na small room, probably not much bigger\n\n171\n00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.160\nthan our studio here that we're\ntalking to you from, in theory,\n\n172\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.770\ndepending on how much infrastructure\nyou've gotta buy and/or put in there.\n\n173\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.470\nMay even be smaller than this, right?\n\n174\n00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.350\nI mean I'm sure you've\nbeen in them as well.\n\n175\n00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.380\nI've been in rooms that are half this\nsize in theory, and that would still\n\n176\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.680\ncertainly be able to host two or\nthree or four racks of infrastructure\n\n177\n00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.710\nwith the appropriate cabling, and\nall the stuff you need with no trouble.\n\n178\n00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.570\nIt would be a little tight right?\n\n179\n00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:51.910\n>> Mm hm.\n>> You wouldn't want to spend a lot of\n\n180\n00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.610\ntime in there but one person going and\ndoing some work, moving stuff around,\n\n181\n00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.356\nyou can easily do that it in a 100\nsquare feet or less with no trouble.\n\n182\n00:08:59.356 --> 00:09:03.110\nSo you want to understand that this\ncould be a varied size building, or\n\n183\n00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.790\na varied size room within a building,\nbut the concepts are the same.\n\n184\n00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.759\nSecuring access to the front end,\nmaking sure the door is locked,\n\n185\n00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:12.640\nand that we have a way to\nunderstand who's going in there.\n\n186\n00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.870\nPut up a close circuit TV camera,\nboth outside the door and inside the room.\n\n187\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:20.080\nSo that way if people are in there\nyou can see what they're doing.\n\n188\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.250\nMaking sure that you've\ngot enough cooling,\n\n189\n00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.460\nwe've talked about HVAC,\nenough power and redundant power.\n\n190\n00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.830\nSo you have UPS battery backups, you've\ngot, you may or may not have a generator\n\n191\n00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.490\nright, in a small office with 50 or\n100 square feet of space ,you're\n\n192\n00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.790\nprobably not gonna have a generator\nsitting outside for something that small.\n\n193\n00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.130\nSo you may just rely on UPS systems to\nprovide that battery backup essentially,\n\n194\n00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.370\nthat 10or 20 minutes of continuity,\nin case power goes out.\n\n195\n00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.560\nAt that point it's really not so\nmuch about staying online,\n\n196\n00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.890\nalthough certainly you're\nonline while that's happening.\n\n197\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.650\nIt's really more about being\nable to shut down gracefully.\n\n198\n00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.190\nBeing able to take that infrastructure and\ngo through some sort of shut down cycle,\n\n199\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:10:00.260\neither manual or automated, so that way\nif the power is going to come back on,\n\n200\n00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.480\nyou may obviously wait, maybe five or\nsix minutes and say okay we'll see.\n\n201\n00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.960\nWe've got 20 minutes of time.\n\n202\n00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.130\nIt takes us ten minutes\nto shut the servers down.\n\n203\n00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.850\nWe can wait eight minutes and\nstill have a little buffer, just in case.\n\n204\n00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.350\nIf the power comes back on in eight\nminutes we don't shut anything down.\n\n205\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.430\nYou could do that, but essentially at that\npoint, UPSs are really about making sure\n\n206\n00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.850\nyou can shut infrastructure off safely so\nyou don't crash systems, and then you\n\n207\n00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.010\nessentially just have to wait until the\npower comes on and you restart everything.\n\n208\n00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.060\nSo we'll have that kind\nof infrastructure right?\n\n209\n00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.890\nBut we may not have\na central monitoring station\n\n210\n00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:36.700\nwhere we're gonna have a couple of people\nwith the 60 inch heads up displays and\n\n211\n00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.170\nlooking at traffic flows and\nthousands of machines running.\n\n212\n00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:42.940\nThat may just not be us, but that doesn't\nmean we don't have a data center.\n\n213\n00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.600\nJust means we have a much\nsmaller version of that.\n\n214\n00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.816\nA data center junior, if you will.\n\n215\n00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:47.316\n>> Yeah.\n\n216\n00:10:47.316 --> 00:10:49.230\n>> As opposed to a full data center.\n\n217\n00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.278\nI'd like the light plate please.\n\n218\n00:10:51.278 --> 00:10:52.439\n>> Half the calories.\n\n219\n00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:53.623\n>> Half the calories.\n\n220\n00:10:53.623 --> 00:10:56.962\nAll the infrastructure, but\nhalf the calories, data center light.\n\n221\n00:10:56.962 --> 00:10:59.187\nWell, we're just coming with\nall sorts of great ideas.\n\n222\n00:10:59.187 --> 00:11:01.584\nWe've got Hurricane Pizza,\ngot Data Center Light.\n\n223\n00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:03.418\nWe'll be millionaires on trademarks alone.\n\n224\n00:11:03.418 --> 00:11:09.180\n>> My God, we should get the chairs,\nkick back and we're done.\n\n225\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:11.700\nWe can laugh at Mike the whole day, right?\n\n226\n00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.980\nNo, we're not gonna do that,\nI'm only kidding.\n\n227\n00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:18.620\nAll right, so factors that impact a data\ncenter, right, are gonna be varied.\n\n228\n00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.840\nThere's gonna be environmental factors\nas we know, there's gonna space factors.\n\n229\n00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.760\nDo we have enough room?\n\n230\n00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.480\nDo we have enough infrastructure?\n\n231\n00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.280\nDo we have enough trained individuals?\n\n232\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.990\nA lot of times you see customers\nbuild up data centers, or\n\n233\n00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:31.430\nthey kinda acquired the space over time,\nand\n\n234\n00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:34.780\njust continue to add in infrastructure,\nyou know, prior to the cloud, right.\n\n235\n00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.910\nAnd so at some point they're just\ncontinuing to rack and stack servers,\n\n236\n00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.470\nand over time it gets big.\n\n237\n00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:43.600\nAnd they've got a team that's typically\ndedicated to doing things there.\n\n238\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.050\nAnd then as they convert\nover to the cloud,\n\n239\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:50.300\nwhile the space management may not be as\nmuch of an issue, it's the human capital,\n\n240\n00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.360\nright, that may become the bottle neck,\nthe single point of failure.\n\n241\n00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.810\nYou may have a whole bunch of trained\nprofessionals, IT people, that really\n\n242\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:02.090\nunderstand and know their jobs prior\nto the cloud outside of the cloud well.\n\n243\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.850\nBut as you migrate into the cloud,\nthose skills may need to change, right?\n\n244\n00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.030\nThey may need to understand\ndifferent technologies.\n\n245\n00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.530\nYou may now be using Docker for\ninstance with containerization.\n\n246\n00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.960\nYou may be using Chef or Puppet, or\n\n247\n00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.650\nSalt, for platform automation and\nrapid deployment with dev ops.\n\n248\n00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.320\nAnd these are products and\nplatform tools that you may not have used\n\n249\n00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.450\nprior to the cloud, right, you just\nprobably had no reason to use a lot of\n\n250\n00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.610\nthem prior to the cloud, and as a result\nof that you may not have a staff or\n\n251\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.840\na group of individuals that understands\nhow to exist and operate in the cloud.\n\n252\n00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.370\nAnd as you migrate, you may have to not\nonly switch out infrastructure, but you\n\n253\n00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.610\nmay have to retrain those people and make\nsure you focus on acquisition of skills.\n\n254\n00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.970\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n255\n00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.305\nThe types of service models\nwe're gonna support.\n\n256\n00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:50.820\nPAS, ISS, we've been talking about those\nrelentlessly in almost every episode.\n\n257\n00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.860\nThey come up along with our, so\n\n258\n00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.750\nour service models,\nalong with our deployment models.\n\n259\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.820\nPublic cloud, private cloud,\nhybrid cloud, and\n\n260\n00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.170\nor community cloud, and\nthe idea of risk, right?\n\n261\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:05.060\nWe mentioned these three concepts\npretty much in every episode we've done\n\n262\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.350\nwith regards to this whole\ndiscussion on the cloud.\n\n263\n00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.010\nWhat are the operating standards?\n\n264\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:09.850\nWhat are the policies?\n\n265\n00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.040\nWhat are the procedures?\n\n266\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.570\nWhat are the business\nrequirements we have to achieve?\n\n267\n00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.810\nAre we going to be thinking about,\nas I mentioned a moment ago,\n\n268\n00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.089\nautomating service enablement.\n\n269\n00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:23.310\nContainerization and\nthe framework concept of DevOpps.\n\n270\n00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:25.200\nThe idea of scripting and\n\n271\n00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.420\nsoftware defining and automating is\na very important component of the cloud.\n\n272\n00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.100\nWhatever the technology platform you use.\n\n273\n00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:35.190\nIt's not that if you use Chef or\nPuppet it's good or bad.\n\n274\n00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.010\nIt's not that if you use Docker it's good,\nand if you don't use Docker it's bad.\n\n275\n00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.250\nIt's just a generic idea,\n\n276\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.930\nthat you have to decide what level of\nautomation you would like to achieve.\n\n277\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:46.960\nYou may do this on the Microsoft\ndujour fabric with Power Shell,\n\n278\n00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.420\nby scripting and automating.\n\n279\n00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.990\nAnd using Orchestrator\nto do your deployment.\n\n280\n00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.910\nYou may do it on AWS, and\ndo scripting there, and\n\n281\n00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:58.050\nuse the set of tools that they\nmaintain to do automated deployments.\n\n282\n00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.430\nIt's a template concept.\n\n283\n00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.950\nIt's a cloning concept.\n\n284\n00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.860\nIt's generic to the platform,\nin the sense that the idea is the same.\n\n285\n00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.910\nIt's the name of the tool\nthat we would focus on.\n\n286\n00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.160\nSo you just wanna be aware of the fact\nthat automation is gonna be important.\n\n287\n00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.312\nContinuous monitoring,\n\n288\n00:14:11.312 --> 00:14:15.010\nconsolidation of monitoring capabilities\nplays into data center design.\n\n289\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.750\nHow much infrastructure do we have?\n\n290\n00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.840\nHow much monitoring can we achieve?\n\n291\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.230\nWhat about reducing mean time to repair?\n\n292\n00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.280\nSo the idea of how quickly you\ncan swap out infrastructure\n\n293\n00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.310\nis what mean time to repair is.\n\n294\n00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.210\nMTTR is the acronym for\nthat particular concept.\n\n295\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.200\nWe've talked also about RPO,\nrecovery point objective,\n\n296\n00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.050\nRTO, recovery time objective,\nMTD, maximum tolerable downtime,\n\n297\n00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:43.300\nand our BCDR, Business Continuity\nDisaster Recovery conversations.\n\n298\n00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:46.680\nSo wanna go back and\nthink through the logic of how we approach\n\n299\n00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.720\nall of that because that may\nimpact our center design.\n\n300\n00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.130\nWe may need additional infrastructure and\n\n301\n00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.110\nadditional standby capacity to not\nonly be able to meet our RPL and\n\n302\n00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:01.070\nRTL objectives, but to centrally meet our\nMDT objective, so that way we can deal\n\n303\n00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.080\nwith business continuity, business\ninterruption, and disaster issues.\n\n304\n00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.774\nWe may need to and do need to identify and\ndeal with the MTBF, the mean time between\n\n305\n00:15:09.774 --> 00:15:14.700\nfailure, ranking or rating the tolerance\nlevel for failure on our hardware.\n\n306\n00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.860\nSo every manufacturer of\nevery piece of hardware\n\n307\n00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.700\nis gonna give you a general idea of how\nlong that hardware would be in service\n\n308\n00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.440\nprior to it reaching that arch\nwhere it starts to fail, right.\n\n309\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.870\nNow when we think about large scale\nstorage arrays, for instance, in the cloud\n\n310\n00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.980\nand in virtualized environments today,\nwe can almost down to the minute tell you\n\n311\n00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:36.110\nwhen those hard drives are gonna fail,\nbecause the monitoring is so good today.\n\n312\n00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.800\nAnd we have a really good idea of\nthe tolerance level associated with\n\n313\n00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.810\nmanufacturing.\n\n314\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.320\nThat the vendors that manufacture\nthose cabinets, they have a sense,\n\n315\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.130\nbecause they use very\nspecialized infrastructure.\n\n316\n00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.298\nThey use high quality drives.\n\n317\n00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:50.521\nAnd when you pay $500,000 for sand,\n\n318\n00:15:50.521 --> 00:15:53.988\nyou expect to be able to know when\nthose drives are gonna fail, right?\n\n319\n00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:57.799\nAnd if it's SSD, as opposed to magnetic\nplatters, traditional hard drives\n\n320\n00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:01.139\nspinning, We can tell you based on\npower up and power down cycles and\n\n321\n00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:05.242\nhours on the platform for use when those\ndrives will fail because they're rated for\n\n322\n00:16:05.242 --> 00:16:06.910\ncertain amount of power cycles.\n\n323\n00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.490\nThat's how SSD drives\nare essentially rated for\n\n324\n00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.545\nMTBF because they're not spinning.\n\n325\n00:16:11.545 --> 00:16:15.205\nYou're just powering up the memory and\nessentially using it and powering it down.\n\n326\n00:16:15.205 --> 00:16:19.025\nSo those power cycles are ultimately\ngonna be how we measure failure.\n\n327\n00:16:19.025 --> 00:16:22.045\nSo we have to understand MTBF as well,\nand we have to be able to\n\n328\n00:16:22.045 --> 00:16:27.135\nmeasure these things through them and\nintegrate them into this discussion.\n\n329\n00:16:27.135 --> 00:16:29.445\nAnd I've mentioned already multi-tendency.\n\n330\n00:16:29.445 --> 00:16:34.853\nWe have to understand the idea that we\nmay be private on-cloud, private OnStar.\n\n331\n00:16:34.853 --> 00:16:38.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Private on-prem cloud, right,\n\n332\n00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.470\nwhere we essentially are the IT\nprovider to the business and\n\n333\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.790\nthe business is our customer, and\nthe business is doing everything.\n\n334\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.520\nWe're not worried about\nmulti-tenancy there traditionally.\n\n335\n00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.750\nWe may have different business units\nhosting in the same environments, and\n\n336\n00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.480\nwe may wanna isolate them.\n\n337\n00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.250\nHR's information, typically,\nshould be isolated\n\n338\n00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:59.530\nfrom the rest of the organization,\nusing logical controls, typically.\n\n339\n00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.650\nWe may have separate physical servers,\n\n340\n00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:05.430\nphysical hosts that are used\nto virtualize ERP systems,\n\n341\n00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:11.180\nto virtualize the financial reporting\ninfrastructure, cuz we want that separate.\n\n342\n00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.960\nYou wanna manage payroll and invoicing\nseparate from everything else, so\n\n343\n00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.870\nthat way you could control access to those\nsystems a little bit more granularly.\n\n344\n00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:22.380\nBut the reality is it's still all running\nin one common pool of infrastructure.\n\n345\n00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:26.800\nSo as a result, we want to understand\nthat in a private cloud on prem,\n\n346\n00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.860\nwe're not really worried as much\nabout multi-tenancy as the CCSP.\n\n347\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.000\nWe're worried about logical security\ncontrols and perhaps physical access.\n\n348\n00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.031\nBut we're not really worried about\nthe traditional multi-tenant environments.\n\n349\n00:17:37.031 --> 00:17:41.740\nMulti-tenant networking and multi-tenancy\nare really the purview and the area and\n\n350\n00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.625\nthe focus of these large scale data\ncenters that are hosting thousands of\n\n351\n00:17:46.625 --> 00:17:50.755\nof companies simultaneously, where they've\ngotta be able to provide individualized\n\n352\n00:17:50.755 --> 00:17:55.655\ninfrastructure to each individual client\nor customer, and make it appear as if\n\n353\n00:17:55.655 --> 00:17:59.825\nthat infrastructure's dedicated to them,\nand not available to anybody else.\n\n354\n00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:03.890\nSo in that model, we're talking about\nthe need for and the awareness of,\n\n355\n00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.910\nfrom a security standpoint,\nmulti-tenancies, very, very important.\n\n356\n00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.050\nWe need multiple redundant networks,\nmultiple redundant access,\n\n357\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.960\npathways to get to storage.\n\n358\n00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.850\nWe need multiple hosts that\nare dedicated to individual companies.\n\n359\n00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:20.840\nWe need replicated infrastructure\nthat's gonna just be cranked out and\n\n360\n00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.150\nthen partitioned off, essentially, for\n\n361\n00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:26.530\nthese particular individuals\nthat decided to host with us.\n\n362\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.300\nWe need to think about\nsoftware definition.\n\n363\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.760\nWe've talked about this, the management\nplane versus the data plane.\n\n364\n00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.070\nSo we've made this distinction\nin prior episodes as well.\n\n365\n00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.280\nRemember the cloud management plaen is\nessentially where we provide monitoring\n\n366\n00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.530\nand administration of\nall the cloud resources.\n\n367\n00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:43.810\nSo we need to understand that,\nand we need to keep that in mind.\n\n368\n00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.380\nWe need to look at SLAs and\nthe use of SLAs to manage and\n\n369\n00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.950\nto document our\ninfrastructure expectations.\n\n370\n00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.830\nWe've talked extensively about this.\n\n371\n00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.390\nWe need to understand a registry or\nhave some sort of registration process for\n\n372\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.850\nall the services that\nare going to be available.\n\n373\n00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:00.750\nAt one point,\nI think we went out prior episode, and\n\n374\n00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.040\ntook a look at Amazon's service offering,\nright?\n\n375\n00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.490\nI think I had you go out, we took a look\nand said wow, you know there's 50 or\n\n376\n00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.530\n100 services on the web page,\nwhatever it was.\n\n377\n00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.240\nAnd that's a service registry right?\n\n378\n00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.130\nIt's essentially a catalog\nof the opportunities you\n\n379\n00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.820\nhave as a customer to consume.\n\n380\n00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:16.490\nMicrosoft does the same thing.\n\n381\n00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.730\nAny of the cloud vendors does that today.\n\n382\n00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:23.070\nIf you're a private cloud provider\non prem to the business through IT,\n\n383\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.510\nyou should still publish a list of\nservices available to the business, still\n\n384\n00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:32.050\nvery important to consider, along with\nthat we should have a risk catalog right?\n\n385\n00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:33.680\nWe've talked a lot about risk appetite and\n\n386\n00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.420\nunderstanding the risks that\nthe business is willing to bear.\n\n387\n00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.350\nWe know that virtualization\nis an underlying technology,\n\n388\n00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:43.340\nenables the cloud, but we have to\nreally detail out, for ourselves, for\n\n389\n00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.860\nthe business, and for our customers,\nif we're CSP, a cloud service provider.\n\n390\n00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.990\nWhat are opportunities are to consume, and\n\n391\n00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.550\nwhat the expectations\nare to consume securely.\n\n392\n00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.365\nThe CCSP plays a very large part in this,\nright.\n\n393\n00:19:55.365 --> 00:19:58.015\nIt's very important for\nus to be thinking about these things.\n\n394\n00:19:58.015 --> 00:19:59.925\nWe have to think about\nboth the physical and\n\n395\n00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:02.885\nthe logical design solutions\nwe are gonna implement.\n\n396\n00:20:02.885 --> 00:20:05.425\nIn other words,\nwhat is management plane gonna look like?\n\n397\n00:20:05.425 --> 00:20:07.607\nWhat's the storage network\ngonna gonna look like?\n\n398\n00:20:07.607 --> 00:20:10.817\nWhat's the traffic management\ncapability in the system?\n\n399\n00:20:10.817 --> 00:20:13.677\nSo the management plane,\nthe control plane, the networking,\n\n400\n00:20:13.677 --> 00:20:18.407\nthe compute resources, how many hosts,\nhow much memory, how many CPUs,\n\n401\n00:20:18.407 --> 00:20:22.307\nhow many network cards, how much storage,\nall of that has to be thought through.\n\n402\n00:20:22.307 --> 00:20:27.037\nWe have to link that to our different\nservice models, IS, PASS and SAS.\n\n403\n00:20:27.037 --> 00:20:30.880\nSo we have to think about the fact that,\nas we've already talked about with IS,\n\n404\n00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.900\nwe're getting all that infrastructure\nessentially handed to us as a customer,\n\n405\n00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.070\nand we're gonna provide and provision\nout the thought process and the design.\n\n406\n00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:42.270\nWe're gonna essentially apply\na logical and a physical design of\n\n407\n00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.130\nthat infrastructure to make a network and\nto provide resources.\n\n408\n00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:50.750\nThe cloud service provider on the back end\nis managing the actual provisioning of\n\n409\n00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:53.720\nthat infrastructure,\ncarving it off, giving it to us.\n\n410\n00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.370\nBut we're then taking our piece and then\nwe're then setting it up the way we want.\n\n411\n00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.860\nSo there's gonna be, as we've already\ntalked about, this duality, right,\n\n412\n00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.530\nthis shared responsibility.\n\n413\n00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:03.700\nBut the responsibility for\n\n414\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.150\nthe cloud provider is relatively\nminimal in the IS platform.\n\n415\n00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:09.930\nRemember physical security is\nthe responsibility of the cloud provider\n\n416\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.060\nin every one of these service models,\n\n417\n00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:16.308\nbut out beyond that, then there may\nnot be much the cloud provider does.\n\n418\n00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:21.240\nWhereas in PAS we're gonna be able to use\nthe infrastructure that the cloud provider\n\n419\n00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:25.680\ngives us, cuz they provision that, so they\ngive us the IS, but they provision it, and\n\n420\n00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.790\nthey install the operating\nenvironment on top of that.\n\n421\n00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:31.970\nAnd then they give that to us, and then as\nthe customer, we install the application\n\n422\n00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:35.460\nenvironment and virtualize on top of it,\ndo whatever we need to do.\n\n423\n00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.467\nSo it's very specific there because\nwe see not quite a 50/50 split, but\n\n424\n00:21:39.467 --> 00:21:43.722\ncertainly the closest we get with regards\nto responsibility on those sides of that\n\n425\n00:21:43.722 --> 00:21:44.231\ndivide.\n\n426\n00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:48.137\nAnd then with SAS, we gonna have\nessentially everything provided to us, and\n\n427\n00:21:48.137 --> 00:21:51.984\nall we handing the cloud providers\nessentially from the user perspective,\n\n428\n00:21:51.984 --> 00:21:54.928\nthe customer perspective,\nis data, and then our users,\n\n429\n00:21:54.928 --> 00:21:58.500\nwe're gonna use our administration and\nwe gonna provide data.\n\n430\n00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.530\nSo we have to think about the fact that\nat every level there are tools that we as\n\n431\n00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.700\ncustomers may have to implement security\nand we may have control over aspects of\n\n432\n00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.460\nthe architecture, but there are going\nto be limitations to what we can do.\n\n433\n00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.130\nAnd the cloud provider is going\nto have certain capabilities and\n\n434\n00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.130\ncertain expectations, and as a result,\n\n435\n00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:21.000\ncertain responsibilities that they have\nto live up to on the design side as well.\n\n436\n00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.320\nWith regards to security.\n\n437\n00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.210\nSo as a CCSP, we really have to\nunderstand where we are, and\n\n438\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:29.050\nwhat the model indicates the limitations\nof our abilities will be.\n\n439\n00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.260\nIt's very critical, and\nI wanna make sure you understand that.\n\n440\n00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:36.235\nRemember physical design, this was\nlogical design has to come together in\n\n441\n00:22:36.235 --> 00:22:39.745\norder to be able to figure out how to\nreally produce good infrastructure.\n\n442\n00:22:39.745 --> 00:22:41.765\nAre we building,\na building that is secure?\n\n443\n00:22:41.765 --> 00:22:45.765\nIs it in an area that if we potentially\nhave flood concerns is raised so\n\n444\n00:22:45.765 --> 00:22:48.462\nthat way standing water doesn't\nget into into the data center?\n\n445\n00:22:48.462 --> 00:22:50.622\nIs it going to be built\nof sturdy construction?\n\n446\n00:22:50.622 --> 00:22:54.542\nSo, built with good materials, built\nto withstand a certain level of storm.\n\n447\n00:22:54.542 --> 00:22:58.082\nYou know there was a hail event\nsometime over the last week I\n\n448\n00:22:58.082 --> 00:23:00.612\nremember hearing about over the last\nweek as I was travelling around\n\n449\n00:23:00.612 --> 00:23:01.862\ngetting ready to come here.\n\n450\n00:23:01.862 --> 00:23:05.872\nSomewhere out in, I think it may have been\nTexas or Louisiana, I don't remember where\n\n451\n00:23:05.872 --> 00:23:09.732\nit was, but they had golf ball,\nnot golf ball, softball sized hail.\n\n452\n00:23:09.732 --> 00:23:11.990\nWe're talking like four\nto six inches across.\n\n453\n00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.900\nDamage cars, damage roofs,\nit's that kind of stuff.\n\n454\n00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.940\nYou think well,\nmy house is pretty sturdy, pretty secure.\n\n455\n00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:22.360\nYou get a five-inch hail ball falling\nout of the sky at, I don't know,\n\n456\n00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.220\na couple hundred miles an hour,\nhowever hard and fast it comes, and\n\n457\n00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:27.780\nit's punching holes in people's roofs.\n\n458\n00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:29.480\nI mean, this is big time stuff, right?\n\n459\n00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.120\nSo not that you necessarily will be in\nan area where hail's gonna fall out of\n\n460\n00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.580\nthe sky, but you may have something else.\n\n461\n00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.630\nYou may have tornadoes, you may have\nearthquakes, you may have forest fires,\n\n462\n00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.340\nlandslides, who knows what?\n\n463\n00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.440\nZombies, you always\ngotta worry about those.\n\n464\n00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.026\nSo, as a result,\nwe wanna make sure that we're planning,\n\n465\n00:23:46.026 --> 00:23:48.268\nwe're thinking about planning for\nthose things.\n\n466\n00:23:48.268 --> 00:23:52.300\nI mentioned in one of our prior\nconversations with regards to data center\n\n467\n00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.126\ndesign, that typically big, large-scale\ncommercial data centers get to typically\n\n468\n00:23:57.126 --> 00:23:59.440\nrelocated or resided Within a few miles,\n\n469\n00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:03.141\nif not directly next door to fire\nrescue capabilities, because,\n\n470\n00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:06.740\nnot that we're always necessarily\nworried about life safety.\n\n471\n00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.860\nI mean, in the sense that somebody,\nGod forbid, there is an accident,\n\n472\n00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.425\nsomebody gets hurt,\nyou want them to get treatment right away.\n\n473\n00:24:12.425 --> 00:24:15.410\nBut I'm not thinking so much about\nparamedics responding to the data center,\n\n474\n00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.224\nI m thinking more about firemen\nresponding to the data center, right.\n\n475\n00:24:18.224 --> 00:24:22.430\nIf there's a fire, and let's be honest,\nyou've got millions of dollars of\n\n476\n00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:25.140\ninfrastructure running\nhuge amounts of power.\n\n477\n00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.190\nPotentially explosive compounds like\ngasoline and diesel oil sitting\n\n478\n00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:33.940\nin generators, and you've got all this\ninfrastructure that's highly sensitive.\n\n479\n00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.350\nIf there is a problem,\n\n480\n00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.360\nyou wanna make sure you can get the right\npeople there as soon as possible.\n\n481\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.200\nSo we tend to see these things sited very\nclose to that kind of response mechanism.\n\n482\n00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.620\nAre you gonna build or buy, right?\n\n483\n00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.890\nAs a company,\ndo you build your own data center?\n\n484\n00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.220\nIs it cheaper to go out and buy or\nrent space, or buy the building?\n\n485\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.800\nI think I shared with you the story\nabout one of my customers down south\n\n486\n00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:59.330\nwho wound up just through a set\nof happenstance circumstances,\n\n487\n00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.780\nbeing able to buy a data\ncenter that an ISP had built.\n\n488\n00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.460\nBut then was not able to really operate\nbecause of the downturn in the economy.\n\n489\n00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.480\nAnd they bought it for\npennies on the dollar.\n\n490\n00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.890\nSo they bought a 400,000 square foot\nTier IV data center for next to nothing.\n\n491\n00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.160\nAnd as a result of that, they've now\nnot only provisioned out their needs,\n\n492\n00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.210\nwhich is very small,\nlike maybe 50,000 square feet or so.\n\n493\n00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:23.620\nThey're gonna start carving off and\nselling managed services and\n\n494\n00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:24.792\nspace in that data center.\n\n495\n00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:28.025\nIn their vertical, because they feel\nthey can actually make a lot of money\n\n496\n00:25:28.025 --> 00:25:32.250\nco-hosting and providing services to other\nbusinesses in their line of business,\n\n497\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:34.270\nbecause they're gonna need secure hosting.\n\n498\n00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:35.830\nSo that kinda thing can happen.\n\n499\n00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.300\nSo you wanna be aware of that and\nwanna think about that.\n\n500\n00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:42.665\nWe talked about the data center standards,\nthe Uptime Institute's standards.\n\n501\n00:25:42.665 --> 00:25:45.396\nWe talked about the ASHRAE\ntemperature standards.\n\n502\n00:25:45.396 --> 00:25:48.331\nI know we have a couple of graphics\nthat I asked you to put together for\n\n503\n00:25:48.331 --> 00:25:50.973\nus on both if we could take\na look at Daniel's desktop there.\n\n504\n00:25:50.973 --> 00:25:56.149\nWe've got the ASHRAE temperature\nstandards sitting up there on the slider,\n\n505\n00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:59.580\nexcuse me, up on the,\nwhat do you call that thing?\n\n506\n00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.453\n>> Diagram.\n>> Screen, yes, thank you.\n\n507\n00:26:01.453 --> 00:26:04.720\nI meant the thing I'm pointing\nto over there on the monitor.\n\n508\n00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.632\nOn your screen and for\neverybody looking there.\n\n509\n00:26:07.632 --> 00:26:09.060\nHey, it's Friday morning.\n>> It is.\n\n510\n00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.020\n>> I didn't have coffee.\n\n511\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.200\nYou got to work with me here\na little bit until I get going.\n\n512\n00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.786\n>> The zombification has begun.\n\n513\n00:26:13.786 --> 00:26:16.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's the lack of coffee that's begun.\n\n514\n00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.960\n>> So what we see up there, and\nthis is really just a reminder for\n\n515\n00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.280\nyou because we have had this\ndiscussion in a prior episode.\n\n516\n00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.860\nI encourage you to go back and\ntake a look if you have not seen it yet.\n\n517\n00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.188\nBut this is gonna be the group\nof standards for temperature and\n\n518\n00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:31.468\nhumidity from ASHRAE,\n\n519\n00:26:31.468 --> 00:26:35.372\nthe group that is gonna set these\nstandards and that everybody looks to.\n\n520\n00:26:35.372 --> 00:26:38.960\nAnd in the prior episode where we did\nthis we actually put up the ASHRAE site.\n\n521\n00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.180\nPulled up the document,\nactually pulled out the site for it.\n\n522\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:45.220\nThis is just a summary, but you'll\nsee low-end and high-end temp there,\n\n523\n00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.805\nboth in Fahrenheit and Celsius.\n\n524\n00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:50.260\nLow-end moisture and\nyou have low-end moisture there twice.\n\n525\n00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.530\nI think it should be low-end-\n>> I do.\n\n526\n00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.160\n>> For the first.\n\n527\n00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.640\nThe bottom one should be\nhigh-end moisture So,\n\n528\n00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.710\nwe're gonna edit that just in real\ntime to make sure that's correct.\n\n529\n00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.790\nAnd I see that I can make fun of you\ncuz I'm not the only who's having\n\n530\n00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.800\na problem this morning.\n\n531\n00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.890\nAll right, so high-end moisture and you'll\nsee that we have the relative humidity\n\n532\n00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:09.473\nand, or the dew point setting there\nin terms of the temperature, right?\n\n533\n00:27:09.473 --> 00:27:11.753\nSo, we wanna make sure\nyou as CCSP candidates,\n\n534\n00:27:11.753 --> 00:27:14.250\nwanna make sure you\nunderstand these numbers.\n\n535\n00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.210\nYou would wanna know what they are because\nas you look at the data center,\n\n536\n00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:19.940\nyou have to make sure that\nthe operational temperature range\n\n537\n00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.980\nis going to be within acceptable\nparameters to safely operate the gear.\n\n538\n00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:28.260\nAnd that you have enough cooling, as well\nas, enough moisture control to be able to\n\n539\n00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.650\nremove moisture from the air so that way\nessentially there's not too much humidity.\n\n540\n00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:37.100\nBecause of that we don't create\neither a problem where we have\n\n541\n00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.510\ntoo much humidity and therefore\npotentially damage the electronics.\n\n542\n00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:44.020\nOr too little humidity and\nwe wind up creating static electrical\n\n543\n00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.010\nconcerns where we're touching stuff and\nwe've got\n\n544\n00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.870\ndamage to electronic infrastructure\nhappening because we're shorting it out.\n\n545\n00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.817\nAnd either one of those can be a problem\nif we're on the low or the high end and\n\n546\n00:27:53.817 --> 00:27:55.210\nwe surpass those ranges.\n\n547\n00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:56.640\nSo we want to make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n548\n00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.380\nAnd then we also the Uptime Institute\nchart that I asked you to take a look at,\n\n549\n00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.760\nor at least to put up for us there.\n\n550\n00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.052\nSo we're gonna just zoom a little\nbit on that, I think, right?\n\n551\n00:28:05.052 --> 00:28:09.392\nAnd so we're gonna be able to see from\nthe Uptime Institute with regards to data\n\n552\n00:28:09.392 --> 00:28:12.370\ncenter design and\nthe tier levels of the data center.\n\n553\n00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:14.311\nTier I, Tier II, Tier III, Tier IV.\n\n554\n00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:17.965\nWe wanna understand roughly what\na summation of those levels indicates and\n\n555\n00:28:17.965 --> 00:28:21.260\nlooks like and we put together\na nice little chart for you here.\n\n556\n00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:23.612\nYou also wanna know what\nthe the named levels are.\n\n557\n00:28:23.612 --> 00:28:25.743\nIn other words,\nTier I is called Tier I, but\n\n558\n00:28:25.743 --> 00:28:28.470\nit's also called\nBasic Site Infrastructure.\n\n559\n00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:33.450\nAnd we went through and looked at this\nas well online at the Uptime Institute,\n\n560\n00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:35.345\nI think it's UptimeInstitute.org.\n\n561\n00:28:35.345 --> 00:28:38.175\nWe went out and we took a look at their\nwebsite, we showed you the cool little\n\n562\n00:28:38.175 --> 00:28:42.323\ncoverage map about where data centers are\nand how they're rated, in a prior episode.\n\n563\n00:28:42.323 --> 00:28:45.015\nSo Tier I is called basic\nsite infrastructure,\n\n564\n00:28:45.015 --> 00:28:50.425\nTier II Redundant Site\nInfrastructure Capacity Components.\n\n565\n00:28:50.425 --> 00:28:53.905\nTier III Concurrently Maintainable\nSite Infrastructure, and\n\n566\n00:28:53.905 --> 00:28:56.615\nTier IV Fault-tolerant\nSite Infrastructure.\n\n567\n00:28:56.615 --> 00:28:58.800\nSo, just want to make\nsure you know the names.\n\n568\n00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.060\nBut also if you take a look at the chart,\nand\n\n569\n00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:06.590\nyou can see here that we have the number\nof distribution paths available.\n\n570\n00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:11.130\nThe number of concurrent or the ability\nto be able to provide fault tolerance,\n\n571\n00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:14.290\nthe ability to be able to do\ncontinuous cooling, the ability for\n\n572\n00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:15.970\ncompartmentalization.\n\n573\n00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.560\nAnd it's a simple matrix, yes, no right?\n\n574\n00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.145\nActive capacity components\nto support the IT load.\n\n575\n00:29:22.145 --> 00:29:26.771\nN or N + 1, or N + whatever, meaning yeah,\nwe have redundancy at certain levels, but\n\n576\n00:29:26.771 --> 00:29:28.510\nmaybe not at every level.\n\n577\n00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.410\nSo you want to make sure you have a sense\nof how these Tiering Systems work.\n\n578\n00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.480\nI would not spend time\nmemorizing the entire chart.\n\n579\n00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.050\nWhat I would do if I was you,\n\n580\n00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:41.004\nis understand that as we move from\nTier I up through Tier II, II and\n\n581\n00:29:41.004 --> 00:29:44.830\nIV, we are getting progressively\nmore complex in our architecture.\n\n582\n00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:49.900\nThere is more redundancy, and as a result\nof that, more survivability, ultimately.\n\n583\n00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.340\nIf we have a problem with\nthe infrastructure and\n\n584\n00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.690\nor if there is a interruption\nevent of some kind,\n\n585\n00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.560\nwe are more likely to be able to survive\nthat event and continue operating.\n\n586\n00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.170\nThat's really what the Tiering System\nrepresents for us, is the ability to rate\n\n587\n00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.090\nor rank data center infrastructure to\nunderstand how survivable it would be.\n\n588\n00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.430\nAnd as a result of that,\nhow we can make a good decision.\n\n589\n00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:17.460\nAs a CCSP, as a business, to decide where\nwe wanna host, with what recoverability,\n\n590\n00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.270\nand what survivability levels.\n\n591\n00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.960\nAnd that's what this represents.\n\n592\n00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.200\nMost of the very high end data centers\nare gonna be Tier III and or tier IV.\n\n593\n00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.010\nIt's very expensive to build\nout those data centers.\n\n594\n00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.570\nAnd it costs a lot more money to host\nthere, but you're not going to go offline\n\n595\n00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:35.290\nmost likely while you're hosting there,\ndespite what may be going on around you.\n\n596\n00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.320\nSo, it's something for you to consider and\n\n597\n00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:41.800\nto think about, you do obviously want to\nmake sure that you are aware of that.\n\n598\n00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:46.399\nAlong with this, we actually did talk\nabout cold and hot aisle isolation,\n\n599\n00:30:46.399 --> 00:30:49.319\nas well as cold air and\nhot aisle, or cold air and\n\n600\n00:30:49.319 --> 00:30:51.952\nhot air management with cold air and cold.\n\n601\n00:30:51.952 --> 00:30:54.398\n[SOUND] Take a breath.\n\n602\n00:30:54.398 --> 00:30:56.610\nLet's think about this,\ngo to your happy place.\n\n603\n00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:59.390\nCold aisle and hot aisle isolation.\n\n604\n00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.600\nBecause the idea there is\nthis idea of cycling air.\n\n605\n00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.888\nAnd if you can imagine one of those\nflow diagrams you may often see,\n\n606\n00:31:05.888 --> 00:31:09.840\nwhere you kind of have air going like this\nor we have air going like this, right?\n\n607\n00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.140\nIt depends on what we're doing.\n\n608\n00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:15.460\nThe idea would be that if we\nhave the cold air cycling or\n\n609\n00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.320\nthe hot air being removed and cycled,\nwe have to then manage that with\n\n610\n00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.460\nisolated rows that are dedicated\njust to cold or hot air management.\n\n611\n00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.880\nSo that is we not only walk\nthrough the data center, but\n\n612\n00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.560\nmore importantly as we manage temperature\nflow, we're not creating zones or\n\n613\n00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.020\nislands of isolation of cold and hot.\n\n614\n00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.965\nBut we're mixing air and\ncreating managed environments.\n\n615\n00:31:34.965 --> 00:31:37.275\nIt's very, very important,\nwe could do it either way.\n\n616\n00:31:37.275 --> 00:31:41.295\nYou see, either the cold air isolation\naisles running down the center, or\n\n617\n00:31:41.295 --> 00:31:42.645\nyou see them on the outer edges.\n\n618\n00:31:42.645 --> 00:31:44.625\nAnd the hot air being\nmanaged in the middle.\n\n619\n00:31:44.625 --> 00:31:45.945\nIt doesn't matter how you do it.\n\n620\n00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:47.420\nThere's pros and cons to both.\n\n621\n00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.978\nIt does matter in the sense that there\nare valuable reasons why you may do one or\n\n622\n00:31:50.978 --> 00:31:53.569\nthe other, depending on the design or\nthe data center.\n\n623\n00:31:53.569 --> 00:31:57.810\nBut ultimately the goal is we wanna be\nable to cycle cold air into the system and\n\n624\n00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.758\nremove hot air and\neither recycle that air to cool it.\n\n625\n00:32:00.758 --> 00:32:03.418\nAnd then use it again, or\nbring it out of the system.\n\n626\n00:32:03.418 --> 00:32:05.810\nKeep in mind, hot air rises, right?\n\n627\n00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:07.160\nCold air falls, right?\n\n628\n00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.350\nSo as a result,\nwe said we wanna bring cold air in, right?\n\n629\n00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.715\nBecause wanna drop it from up above\nbecause that way it's gonna cool as it\n\n630\n00:32:13.715 --> 00:32:15.055\nIt moves down and\n\n631\n00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:19.085\nthen as hot air rises we want to\nremove that hot air from the system.\n\n632\n00:32:19.085 --> 00:32:21.705\nSo we want to keep that in mind and\njust think about that as well.\n\n633\n00:32:21.705 --> 00:32:25.515\nBut when we design these systems correctly\nwe're going to be able to reduce\n\n634\n00:32:25.515 --> 00:32:28.835\nthe cost of running the data\ncenter infrastructure.\n\n635\n00:32:28.835 --> 00:32:30.965\nWe're going to be able to be\nbetter at power management.\n\n636\n00:32:30.965 --> 00:32:33.815\nWe're going to be able to be better\nultimately at temperature management,\n\n637\n00:32:33.815 --> 00:32:36.300\nmoisture control, all the things we need.\n\n638\n00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.150\nWe also have to think about cable\nmanagement in the data center right.\n\n639\n00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:41.150\nWe have to use raised flooring typically,\n\n640\n00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.610\nwe need grade cable to be run,\nwe need cable management and\n\n641\n00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:47.560\ncable channels underneath and\nabove to be able to to do this.\n\n642\n00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.290\nDo you ever walk into I don't know\nwhen you were doing VIT thing\n\n643\n00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:55.780\nright before you started doing this,\nyou went into daughter's standard,\n\n644\n00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:57.970\ndid you get roads of\ngood cable management.\n\n645\n00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.880\n>> Yeah, we have actually did really well\non cable management with something that\n\n646\n00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.210\nour boss was a sticker on, he wanna\neverything and its placed pretty fed\n\n647\n00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:10.540\nin which you know lot of time making sure\nthose cables were in their proper spot,\n\n648\n00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.440\nnot giving any snags, there is no 90\ndegree bends, doing everything possible.\n\n649\n00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.210\nSo the cables are run correctly.\n\n650\n00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.525\n>> Labeled too.\n\n651\n00:33:18.525 --> 00:33:20.988\n[CROSSTALK] So that's gonna be\nthe right way to do it, obviously.\n\n652\n00:33:20.988 --> 00:33:23.771\nBut I'm sure a lot of us\nhave been in situations and\n\n653\n00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:26.780\nseen systems where that\nwas not always the case.\n\n654\n00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.660\nI walk in a lot of data centers\nsometimes I see beautiful\n\n655\n00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.830\nwork something like what you described.\n\n656\n00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:33.950\nOther times, I see well.\n\n657\n00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:34.770\n>> Birds nests.\n>> It's not.\n\n658\n00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:35.530\nJust yeah.\n\n659\n00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:36.050\nWow.\n\n660\n00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.280\nRemember that scene in The Matrix\nat the end in like the third one.\n\n661\n00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.950\n>> Yes.\n>> You know where Neo is\n\n662\n00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.050\ntalking to the machine, and you know\nultimately you know, it's just this multi\n\n663\n00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.620\nkind of octopus like thing, and\nthere's just stuff going everywhere.\n\n664\n00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.660\nIt's like that only it\ndoesn't talk to you.\n\n665\n00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.020\n>> Yeah, I have seen that as well.\n\n666\n00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.040\nIt's not a pretty sight at all.\n\n667\n00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:54.280\n>> No, no.\nIt's kind of scary.\n\n668\n00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.660\nSo we want to typically\nhave a 24 inch height for\n\n669\n00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.150\nclearance under\nthe Ray's Four's installations.\n\n670\n00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:04.120\nSo minimum of two feet typically\nunder those raised data center floors\n\n671\n00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.320\nto be able to run cabling if we have to\nget in there to do maintenance, right.\n\n672\n00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.050\nWe can get down in there and\nyou obviously move stuff around.\n\n673\n00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.760\nWanna make sure that we\nalso have the ability for\n\n674\n00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.610\nairflow to be moving through there.\n\n675\n00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:17.450\nOne of the big mistakes people make, is\nthat they set this stuff up but then they\n\n676\n00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.370\nessentially create blockages in the\nunderlying architecture inside the race\n\n677\n00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.720\nfloor because they dump a bunch of cables\nin there, they don't manage them properly.\n\n678\n00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.980\nOr, and I've seen this happen, they use\nit for storage, so they'd open the floor\n\n679\n00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.650\n>> I'd keep my lunch there.\n\n680\n00:34:31.650 --> 00:34:33.380\n>> Yeah, it's nice and cool, right?\n\n681\n00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:36.510\nSo you know, they got all this stuff\ndown in there that they don't want\n\n682\n00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.330\nlaying around.\n\n683\n00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:40.400\nProblem is you're essentially blocking\nairflow, because one of the things we're\n\n684\n00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.210\ndoing is creating a huge air cycle, air\nflow system under the floor and that two\n\n685\n00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:49.280\nfoot space is so we can cycle air,\nwe can cool it, we can move it around.\n\n686\n00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.640\nAnd if you do that, and\n\n687\n00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:55.840\nwe don't actually have the ability to\nhave unobstructed airflow, you create Nnt\n\n688\n00:34:55.840 --> 00:35:00.800\nonly like an Indy racecourse where air\nhas to navigate around all these issues.\n\n689\n00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.790\nBut you've got islands of airflow.\n\n690\n00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.070\nYou essentially have these\nreally bizarre cooling and\n\n691\n00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:08.600\nheating problems because you\ncan't move air effectively.\n\n692\n00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:09.910\nIt becomes a big issue.\n\n693\n00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.570\nSo we wanna make sure\nwe understand that and\n\n694\n00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.870\nknow that those things are going\nto be also very important.\n\n695\n00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:16.920\nMake sure you keep in mind,\nas silly as it sounds,\n\n696\n00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.080\nthat the outside temperature\noutside your data center,\n\n697\n00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.490\nimpacts your ability to cool and\nheat inside, and you have to understand at\n\n698\n00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:27.420\ncertain points in time data centers work\na lot harder just like our homes do.\n\n699\n00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.100\nTo keep cool or to warm up and we have to\ntake that into account and factor that in,\n\n700\n00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.640\nwe're going to use more power and\n\n701\n00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.620\nwe're going to need to have access to\nthat capability in order to cool or heat.\n\n702\n00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:41.380\nSo we have to think about that we have to\nalso think about the ability to filter\n\n703\n00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:45.010\nparticulate matter coming in when we\nare thinking about these high end,\n\n704\n00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:46.680\nheavy duty HVAC systems.\n\n705\n00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.105\nWe have very, very large scale\nair flow that's being sucked And\n\n706\n00:35:51.105 --> 00:35:53.655\nto essentially create the cooling and\nthe heating.\n\n707\n00:35:53.655 --> 00:35:57.325\nAnd that creates a problem for us because\nthis is not a home air conditioner.\n\n708\n00:35:57.325 --> 00:36:00.405\nYou know a couple of ton unit,\nthis is we're talking about 30, 40,\n\n709\n00:36:00.405 --> 00:36:03.735\n50 ton units and\nwe're talking about lots of them.\n\n710\n00:36:03.735 --> 00:36:07.455\nSome of these large scale data\ncenters have air handling systems that\n\n711\n00:36:07.455 --> 00:36:09.415\nessentially the size of\nsemi tractor trailers.\n\n712\n00:36:09.415 --> 00:36:11.245\nSo they've got five, six, seven, eight,\n\n713\n00:36:11.245 --> 00:36:14.570\nten of them deployed across\nthis infrastructure.\n\n714\n00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:19.170\nAnd to filter air with that kind of volume\nand flow requires specialized systems and\n\n715\n00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.030\nwe've gotta be very sensitive\nto particulate, to dust and\n\n716\n00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:23.770\ncontaminant matter getting in.\n\n717\n00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.720\nWhen 9/11 happened here\nin the United States and\n\n718\n00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.090\nwhen we had that infrastructure that came\ndown as a result of the planes crashing\n\n719\n00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:35.090\ninto the Twin Towers in Manhattan, right?\n\n720\n00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:38.600\nOne of the biggest concerns we had, aside\nfrom the catastrophic loss of life and\n\n721\n00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.500\nall of the things that were obviously\nhorribly problematic with that event.\n\n722\n00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.950\nAside from all of that,\n\n723\n00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:48.330\nthe biggest issue we had on the IT\nside was not the infrastructure loss,\n\n724\n00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:52.430\nwas not the loss of power,\nwas not any of those complicating factors.\n\n725\n00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.690\nMany of the data centers that\nultimately had to shut down, shut down,\n\n726\n00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:58.380\nnot because of those things,\nbecause they were self contained.\n\n727\n00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.460\nThey had power generation capability.\n\n728\n00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.970\nThey had multi-vendor\npathway connectivities, so\n\n729\n00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:05.700\nthey had different vendors\nbringing different circuits in.\n\n730\n00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.580\nIt was actually the tremendous\namount of dust and\n\n731\n00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:11.100\ndebris in the air that was sucked into\nthe air handlers in their systems.\n\n732\n00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.920\nThey were not designed to filter out\nthat kind of dust, that kind of debris,\n\n733\n00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:15.990\nthat kind of dirt.\n\n734\n00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.370\nAnd they got clogged up and\nessentially they couldn't cool.\n\n735\n00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.830\nAnd because of that they had to shut the\nsystems down and the minute you shut down\n\n736\n00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:26.970\nHVAC you essentially are done\nbecause you're running so hot, so\n\n737\n00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.750\nmuch infrastructure inside the data\ncenter you can't cool it and\n\n738\n00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:31.040\nyou've got to shut it off.\n\n739\n00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.740\nIt's like being inside an Easy Bake oven.\n\n740\n00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.264\nRemember the Easy Bake ovens?\n\n741\n00:37:34.264 --> 00:37:35.540\n>> Yeah. Yeah. It gets warm in there.\n\n742\n00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.650\nI've definitely gotten a few\nalerts in my e-mail before.\n\n743\n00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.335\nThe data center has elevated.\n\n744\n00:37:41.335 --> 00:37:45.075\nTemperature over 85 degrees and\nyou're like we need to go in there and\n\n745\n00:37:45.075 --> 00:37:46.105\nfind out what's going on.\n\n746\n00:37:46.105 --> 00:37:48.415\n>> I mean, and\nit can spike really quickly,\n\n747\n00:37:48.415 --> 00:37:51.805\nlike within minutes when you shut off\ncooling in a large system like that.\n\n748\n00:37:51.805 --> 00:37:54.852\nBecause there's only so\nmuch ambient temperature that you can\n\n749\n00:37:54.852 --> 00:37:56.962\nessentially keep in that system for\nthat long and\n\n750\n00:37:56.962 --> 00:38:01.082\nif you don't believe me you take\na bottle out of the refrigerator right.\n\n751\n00:38:01.082 --> 00:38:04.512\nSet is on the counter and\nwatch it start sweating in a warm room and\n\n752\n00:38:04.512 --> 00:38:06.861\nsee how quickly it goes from cold to warm.\n\n753\n00:38:06.861 --> 00:38:11.821\nBecause your evaporating that temperature\nessentially gradient, right everything is\n\n754\n00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:16.001\nhotter outside, and cooler inside you're\ngonna normalize by evaporating essentially\n\n755\n00:38:16.001 --> 00:38:19.696\naway, that cold air to normalize the\ntemperature and it doesn't take very long.\n\n756\n00:38:19.696 --> 00:38:21.110\nSo, So welcome to physics 101.\n\n757\n00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.160\n>> Yeah, thermodynamics.\n\n758\n00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.985\n>> Thermodynamics here on ITProTV.\n\n759\n00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:26.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm professor Thurmond and-\n\n760\n00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:28.510\n>> And this is the second law.\n\n761\n00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.410\n>> Exactly.\n\n762\n00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:32.180\nAlright, anyway those are the most\nimportant things we want to be thinking\n\n763\n00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.070\nabout in regards to data centers, data\ncenter design and obviously as a CCSP,\n\n764\n00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.300\nwe have to be inserting ourselves\ninto these conversations,\n\n765\n00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.340\nunderstanding the concerns, the impact.\n\n766\n00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.880\nAnd the decisions we make both in\nthe physical and logical design elements\n\n767\n00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.420\nthat will allow us to operate safely,\nof course, and securely as well.\n\n768\n00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.840\nAnd we have to balance those two things\nas we talk about this particular area.\n\n769\n00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.030\n>> Yeah, Adam, and it's a good thing\nwe do have these guidelines to help us.\n\n770\n00:38:55.030 --> 00:39:00.370\nAnd for both physical and logical design\nelements that we need as we go through and\n\n771\n00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.410\nbasically build out our data centers.\n\n772\n00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.930\nSo keep these things in mind use the helps\nthat we've shown you throughout these\n\n773\n00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:09.745\nshows so that you can do that effectively\nand keep yourself cool as it were.\n\n774\n00:39:09.745 --> 00:39:12.210\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Keep yourself cool.\n\n775\n00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.630\n>> All right Adam well thank you for\ndropping by and\n\n776\n00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:15.870\nwe thank you guys for watching.\n\n777\n00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:19.910\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off for\nITProTV I've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n778\n00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:20.590\n>> Mister Thermo.\n\n779\n00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.378\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n780\n00:39:23.378 --> 00:39:30.940\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

TV.\n\n3\n00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:17.640\nI am your host Daniel Lawry.\n\n4\n00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.410\nOn today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.290\nwe are continuing on with our certified\ncloud security professional series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.610\nJoining us back in the studio again\ntoday to get a little risky with us,\n\n7\n00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.390\nis our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.800\nAdam, welcome back, sir, how's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.864\n>> Getting risky with it?\n\n10\n00:00:29.864 --> 00:00:30.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Switch\n\n11\n00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.780\nback to that Will Smith reference.\n\n12\n00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.840\nOutstanding.\n\n13\n00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.970\nAll right, so I am doing well.\n\n14\n00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:35.470\nI'm doing well.\n\n15\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.780\nHopefully, all of you are,\nout there in ITProTVland.\n\n16\n00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.720\nIt is Friday and we are happy here\nat IT Pro TV when it is Friday.\n\n17\n00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.800\nFirst and foremost, because we get\nto wrap up talking about risk.\n\n18\n00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.255\nSecondly, because the risk\nof my feet falling off.\n\n19\n00:00:49.255 --> 00:00:51.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> From standing on our soft floor will be\n\n20\n00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.250\nabated here soon when I am done talking to\nyou, so we are both gonna be very happy.\n\n21\n00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.920\nBut in order to make you happy we have\nto talk about risk so let's do that.\n\n22\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.400\nLet's talk about what a risk is.\n\n23\n00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.600\nSo Daniel I'm gonna ask you to,\n\n24\n00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.730\nas you always do,\nhelp me out here with some definitions.\n\n25\n00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.030\nSo when I ask you to describe risk for\nour kind and\n\n26\n00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.610\ngood gentle audience folk,\nwhat do we need to tell them about risk?\n\n27\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.900\nWhat's important to know?\n\n28\n00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.430\n>> It is something that can\npossibly work to your detriment.\n\n29\n00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.480\nI guess that would be one of the most\nsimplest ways of putting it.\n\n30\n00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.210\nThis is an entity, a being of some sort,\nthat if it comes about,\n\n31\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.390\nif it does happen,\nwill be to my chagrin, should I say.\n\n32\n00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.770\n>> Ooh, SAT vocabulary.\n\n33\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.240\nDouble word score on Scrabble.\n\n34\n00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.010\nChagrin.\n\n35\n00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.830\nI was gonna go detriment,\nbut that's just me.\n\n36\n00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.800\nBut okay, chagrin, detriment.\n\n37\n00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.100\nEssentially something that\nhappens that if it does occur,\n\n38\n00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.430\nit's gonna more often than not\nhave a negative consequence.\n\n39\n00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.170\nUsually have a negative\nimpact of some kind.\n\n40\n00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.120\nPotential circumstance or event.\n\n41\n00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.580\nThat if it does happen,\nis realize would typically hurt us or\n\n42\n00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.730\nimpact us somehow in a negative way.\n\n43\n00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.560\nSo we think about risk, overall risk,\n\n44\n00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.170\ngenerically as being\nsomething that is not good.\n\n45\n00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.000\nWe want to avoid.\n\n46\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.640\nInformation security risk.\n\n47\n00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.080\nIs information or risk excuse in\nthe information security space,\n\n48\n00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.980\nassociated with our systems specific to\nthe kind of things that we are doing.\n\n49\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.210\nWe could think about cloud based risks and\n\n50\n00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.350\nthe risks associated with operating the\ncloud, we have indeed talked about some\n\n51\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.850\nof these in prior episodes things such as\nrisks on the virtualization platform with.\n\n52\n00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.630\nHypervisors that are not implemented\ncorrectly, allowing VM escape.\n\n53\n00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.670\nWe've talked about risk associated\nwith the use of encryption and\n\n54\n00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.290\nnot applying it properly and\nexposing data, breaching confidentiality.\n\n55\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.310\nRisks associated with change management\nthat are not implemented correctly\n\n56\n00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.160\nnot validated properly and then not having\nproper roll back or back out plan and\n\n57\n00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.918\nimplementing a change\nthat can cause chaos.\n\n58\n00:02:44.918 --> 00:02:46.330\nCreate incidents and/or problems.\n\n59\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.580\nWe talked about risk in lots of different\nways, the idea of measuring and\n\n60\n00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.450\nassessing and understanding and\nanalyzing risk.\n\n61\n00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.160\nAll the things that we have been\ntalking about in prior episodes\n\n62\n00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.580\nall come together here, right?\n\n63\n00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.380\nWe wanna understand risk assessment.\n\n64\n00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.460\nReally understanding the holistic,\norganization-wide view of risk.\n\n65\n00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.970\nAnd analyzing the impact of risk,\nalso very important for us.\n\n66\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.550\nI know that we have a graphic\nthat helps us to represent\n\n67\n00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.060\nthe risk management process and a document\nthat we have talked about as well.\n\n68\n00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.630\nWe're going to take a look at first let's\njust put up the document real quick if\n\n69\n00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.190\nyou don't mind.\n\n70\n00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.710\n>> The document.\nSure.\n\n71\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.840\n>> If we could just start with that\nwhich is the risk management framework,\n\n72\n00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.456\nwhich is the PDF from Nist.\n\n73\n00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:27.590\nNist 800 37 R1, which is going to\nrepresent and when we drill in and\n\n74\n00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.310\nsee the detail here, I could do it\nright from here I brought my super\n\n75\n00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.460\nmango magneto eyes I can actually see\nbecause I went out during the break and\n\n76\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.310\nI got rid of the eyelashes that were\npreventing me from being able to focus.\n\n77\n00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.390\nBut the guide for applying the risk\nmanagement framework to the federal\n\n78\n00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.230\ninformation systems is what\nNIST 837-R1 is all about.\n\n79\n00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.330\nWe're not as worried about the federal\ninformation systems piece.\n\n80\n00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.250\nWe are more focused on the idea\nof the risk management framework.\n\n81\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.320\nThe NIST risk management framework\nhas become very very central to a lot\n\n82\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.910\nof the discussions about risk whether they\ntake place in the cloud or not lately.\n\n83\n00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.880\nThis is a thought process a document that\nlays out for us the thought process with\n\n84\n00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.690\nregards to risk, with regards to\nhow do you understand and frame or\n\n85\n00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.760\ndiscuss the conversations\nabout risk occurring today,\n\n86\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.690\nthis is becoming one of the foundational\nelements of many of the risk assessment,\n\n87\n00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.770\nrisk analysis, risk management approaches\nthat not only my customers but\n\n88\n00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.150\nmany cloud customers around he world\nare beginning to take on and use.\n\n89\n00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.220\nSo this is something, as a CCSP, you\nwould wanna have some familiarity with.\n\n90\n00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.010\nNot necessarily cuz it's\nan exam related topic.\n\n91\n00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.790\nBut, more broadly in the real world,\nthis document and\n\n92\n00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.550\nthe information possessed within\nit becomes the framework and\n\n93\n00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.490\nthe point of reference for\nyou with regards to risk management.\n\n94\n00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.039\nSo you'd wanna be\nknowledgeable about it so\n\n95\n00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.910\nyou You could speak knowledgeably\nabout risk in the organization.\n\n96\n00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.300\nSo just throwing that out there\nas a point of reference for you.\n\n97\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.040\nBut generically in terms of\na risk management process,\n\n98\n00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.440\nwe do wanna take a look at the graphic,\nand\n\n99\n00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.830\nkinda show you what a traditional risk\nmanagement process will look like.\n\n100\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.950\nWe're probably gonna need to zoom in,\n\n101\n00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.030\nI'm guessing, and I'm just thinking\nhow are we gonna, yeah cuz that,\n\n102\n00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.650\nnow that I see it that yellow text may\nbe just a smidge hard to actually see.\n\n103\n00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.030\nSo we'll talk about that.\n\n104\n00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.600\nI'm thinking more for the people that\nare looking, not so much for us.\n\n105\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.470\nBut the idea is that we have a risk\nmanagement process here that allows us\n\n106\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.140\ngraphically to essentially detail out for\nyou what risk management should look like.\n\n107\n00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.080\nWe're gonna frame risk in the middle,\nthe central circle,\n\n108\n00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.540\nwith regards to framing risk.\n\n109\n00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:29.030\nWhich if you think about the triangle kind\nof being laying on its side looking at it\n\n110\n00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.570\nfrom the bottom head on, so if we stand it\nup and framing is at the top or the apex\n\n111\n00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.550\nof the triangle, and we're laterally\ncoming down and creating the base,\n\n112\n00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.670\nwe would see assess, monitor, or respond\nas three lateral elements of the triangle.\n\n113\n00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.490\nAnd so, when we are framing risk,\nwe are thinking about assessing risk.\n\n114\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.400\nLooking at information and communication\nflows through monitoring, and information\n\n115\n00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.250\nand communication flows that come from\nmonitor to respond, and respond to assess.\n\n116\n00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.010\nSo assessment is the idea of examining and\nunderstanding what's happening.\n\n117\n00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.660\nEvaluating, if you will.\n\n118\n00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.310\nMonitoring let's us take a stock of\nwhat's there, keeping an eye on things.\n\n119\n00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.510\nAnd responding is all about what we will\ndo, or how we will behave when we uncover\n\n120\n00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.590\nactivity that may prove to be a problem\nfor us, so that we want to be able to\n\n121\n00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.260\nsomehow take an action and/or take some\nsort of challenge with and/or against.\n\n122\n00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.920\nAnd framing is the idea of\ncoordinating all this together.\n\n123\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.480\nSo we have some specific\nideas right here represented\n\n124\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.050\nwith regards to how we manage or take\na look at the risk management process.\n\n125\n00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.230\nWe always want to be on guard.\n\n126\n00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.330\nWe always want to be monitoring.\n\n127\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.460\nWe always want to be aware of\nwhat is happening around us.\n\n128\n00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.970\nThat idea of situational operational\nawareness that we speak about and\n\n129\n00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.880\nmonitoring gives us that ability to do\nthat, at the lower left hand corner.\n\n130\n00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.110\nWe wanna be able to assess,\nto evaluate, what we are finding and\n\n131\n00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.380\nseeing with regards to our monitoring.\n\n132\n00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.000\nAnd we wanna be able to respond.\n\n133\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.820\nSo when we think about responding,\nwe think about potentially things such as\n\n134\n00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.850\nIDSS and IPS systems that are gonna\nhelp us to monitor and response.\n\n135\n00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.580\nSpecifically on the response side.\n\n136\n00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.070\nIPS.\nWe may think about firewalls.\n\n137\n00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.500\nWe may think about the ability\nto be able to deploy encryption.\n\n138\n00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.190\nWe may think about the ability\nto be able to redefine and\n\n139\n00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.220\nsomehow change our architecture in\nresponse to one or more events.\n\n140\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.890\nSo we're gonna be thinking about the\nthings that we've already talked about in\n\n141\n00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.090\na lot of these areas in regards\nto risk and risk management.\n\n142\n00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.630\nFraming risk is essentially\nequal to understanding and\n\n143\n00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.730\ndefining what the risk appetite is for\nthe organization.\n\n144\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.950\nIf we can understand what\nthe risk appetite is for\n\n145\n00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.140\nthe organization by coordinating\nthe assess, monitor, and\n\n146\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:35.420\nrespond activities, framing allows\nus to coordinate, sum them up.\n\n147\n00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.898\nCollaborate essentially between the areas,\ncommunicate, and pollinate and\n\n148\n00:07:39.898 --> 00:07:44.039\ncross-pollinate our information in\nsuch a way that we're able to derive\n\n149\n00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:48.337\nan understanding of our tolerance for\nrisk or our appetite for risk will be.\n\n150\n00:07:48.337 --> 00:07:52.424\nAnd the risk management component is\nallowing us to get a risk management\n\n151\n00:07:52.424 --> 00:07:57.047\nstrategy that's gonna address ultimately\nfor us how we want to see risk happen and\n\n152\n00:07:57.047 --> 00:08:01.273\nhow we wanna manage risk within\nthe organization, how we wanna define it.\n\n153\n00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:02.686\nAnd what we want to do with it.\n\n154\n00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:07.061\nRisk assessment is then gonna allow us to\nidentify threats that the organization may\n\n155\n00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:11.436\nface, vulnerabilities that we may have to\naddress, harm, the impact and exposure\n\n156\n00:08:11.436 --> 00:08:15.377\nthat may occur as a result of this, and\nthe likelihood that harm will occur,\n\n157\n00:08:15.377 --> 00:08:20.150\nis what we're really trying to measure and\nultimately manage with risk assessment.\n\n158\n00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:24.240\nWe conduct risk assessment in one of two\nways, quantitatively or qualitatively.\n\n159\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.730\nI know that we have a Word document,\nright, with a formula\n\n160\n00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.700\nthat we're gonna take a look at just\nby way of getting set up there.\n\n161\n00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.760\nSo the Word document that we have is gonna\nshow us how we quantitatively assess risk.\n\n162\n00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.250\nAnd when we think about risk management\nand we think then about risk assessments\n\n163\n00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.210\nspecifically, when we are quantitatively\nassessing risk we are talking about how to\n\n164\n00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.420\nmeasure risk from typically a dollars and\ncents, a numerical perspective.\n\n165\n00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.680\nSome sort of KPI,\nsome metric that we can look at.\n\n166\n00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.108\nAnd it's, gonna walk you through this\nformula with you here in a minute.\n\n167\n00:08:55.108 --> 00:08:58.266\nTypically gonna get distilled down\ninto a dollars and cents conversation.\n\n168\n00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:03.170\nWhen we qualitatively assess risk, we want\nto remind ourselves of the fact that we're\n\n169\n00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:08.410\nnot measuring it with dollars and numbers,\nbut rather it is gonna be a soft measure.\n\n170\n00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.910\nWhen I ask you for\ninstance how happy are you?\n\n171\n00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.736\nI don't give you a scale of one to five,\nI simply say how happy are you?\n\n172\n00:09:15.736 --> 00:09:18.108\nAnd I leave it open to\nyour interpretation, and\n\n173\n00:09:18.108 --> 00:09:20.110\nyou respond I'm kind of happy.\n\n174\n00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.776\nThat's a qualitative measure.\n\n175\n00:09:21.776 --> 00:09:22.936\nIt's an opinion.\n\n176\n00:09:22.936 --> 00:09:27.193\nIt's an assessment based on something\nother than a numerical or factual scale,\n\n177\n00:09:27.193 --> 00:09:29.072\nwhereas a quantitive assessment,\n\n178\n00:09:29.072 --> 00:09:33.270\nthe question asks the same way how happy\nare you on a scale from one to five?\n\n179\n00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.620\nOne being very unhappy, five being\nvery happy, then I could quantify,\n\n180\n00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.383\nI could measure in a sense\nhow happy you are.\n\n181\n00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:44.210\nYou're a four, you're more happy than not,\nthat's good to know.\n\n182\n00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:46.650\nSo we can do this quantitatively or\nqualitatively.\n\n183\n00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.000\nWe often do a hybrid.\n\n184\n00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.960\nWe often will combine the two together,\nbecause we find that just quantitatively,\n\n185\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.160\nfactually measuring risk, doesn't give\nus the full rich complete picture\n\n186\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.020\nof the impact and\nthe potential liability of the risk.\n\n187\n00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.590\nAnd qualitatively measuring only, doesn't\ngive us a true sense of the liability and\n\n188\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.010\nthe impact either, and so\nwe often have to define, and\n\n189\n00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.110\ntherefore combine the two\ntogether in a hybrid approach.\n\n190\n00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:15.670\nBut with regards to quantitative risk\nassessment, let's go through this formula.\n\n191\n00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:20.567\nSo we have annualized loss expectancy\nwhich is commonly referred to as ALE.\n\n192\n00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:25.626\nALE equaling or made up of the two\ncomponent parts Single Loss Expectancy,\n\n193\n00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:31.167\nSLE, S-L-E, multiplied by, the little\nsun or asterisk there is an indication\n\n194\n00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:35.769\nof multiplication, multiplied by ARO,\nAnnual Rate Occurrence.\n\n195\n00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:40.072\nSo we say that ALE = SLE * ARO\nis the formula that we use for\n\n196\n00:10:40.072 --> 00:10:42.855\nquantitative risk assessment.\n\n197\n00:10:42.855 --> 00:10:46.643\nAnd so you can see a little example\nof some numbers down there underneath\n\n198\n00:10:46.643 --> 00:10:48.864\nthe large type that lays everything out.\n\n199\n00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.639\nThe SLE * ARO = ALE right there.\n\n200\n00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:52.151\nAnd so we can see that if,\n\n201\n00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:55.752\nlet's say hypothetically in\na little case study example,\n\n202\n00:10:55.752 --> 00:11:01.170\nif we had been given the following little\nparagraph, right, of the information.\n\n203\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.430\nSo we have a network,\nwe are the network admin.\n\n204\n00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:09.570\nAnd in this network, we have been charged\nwith securing the border, the gateway.\n\n205\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.790\nAnd we see that we have a breach event,\n\n206\n00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.600\na successful breach event that\noccurs once a month, every month.\n\n207\n00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.060\nSo 12 times a year,\nwe are seeing a breach event occur.\n\n208\n00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.770\nEvery time it occurs,\nit costs us a $1,000.\n\n209\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:30.110\nAnd so we would measure the impact\npotentially of that event occurring,\n\n210\n00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:35.110\nbecause we have single loss expectancy\nvalue of SLE, equal to $1,000.\n\n211\n00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.440\nWe have an annualized rate of occurrence,\nARO is 12.\n\n212\n00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.260\nI said once a month,\nso 12 times in a year.\n\n213\n00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:42.810\nSo multiply 1,000 times 12, and\n\n214\n00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:46.300\nmaybe we could do this in real\ntime while we're talking.\n\n215\n00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.020\nSo maybe we could leave the 1,000 there.\n\n216\n00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.970\nMaybe we could say times 12, and\nwe would change that to be 12,000, right?\n\n217\n00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:56.616\nSo we would then get $12,000\nof annualized loss expectancy.\n\n218\n00:11:56.616 --> 00:12:00.753\nIn other words, over the course of a year,\nif we allow this event to go unchallenged,\n\n219\n00:12:00.753 --> 00:12:03.320\nit would cost us, the business, $12,000.\n\n220\n00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.080\nNow we take this, in and of itself,\nthat's valuable information.\n\n221\n00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.304\nWell we know we're facing a $12,000 loss.\n\n222\n00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:11.280\nOkay, get out your checkbook, Mr.\nand Mrs. CEO, right?\n\n223\n00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.260\nBut, the CCSP's gonna come along and\nsay, hey.\n\n224\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.300\nThat's good but I can do better.\n\n225\n00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.650\nI can now take that number,\nthat ALE value, 12000,\n\n226\n00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:23.450\nand I can use that to quantify whether or\n\n227\n00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:28.070\nnot a cost effective counter measure\ncan be found to mitigate this risk.\n\n228\n00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.870\nSo let's scroll down for just a second\nto the bottom of that diagram.\n\n229\n00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.594\nWe have four different ways\nto respond to risk, right?\n\n230\n00:12:33.594 --> 00:12:37.716\nWe can as we've often talked about, no\nparticular priority order here by the way.\n\n231\n00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:41.016\nAll four equally acceptable,\nall four equally important,\n\n232\n00:12:41.016 --> 00:12:44.580\njust randomly listed the way\nthat we put them up the screen.\n\n233\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.850\nWe can avoid risk, we can transfer risk,\nwe can accept risk and or\n\n234\n00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.180\nwe can mitigate risk.\n\n235\n00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.680\nMitigate means to minimize, right?\n\n236\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.480\nTake activity to counter\nmeasure in some way the risk.\n\n237\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.380\nSo let's go back up for\njust a minute if we could.\n\n238\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:00.622\nSo if we are gonna have to spend\n$12,000 a year, $1,000 a month,\n\n239\n00:13:00.622 --> 00:13:03.960\nif we don't deal with this risk,\nif we just let it happen.\n\n240\n00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.060\nThe question now becomes,\nwhat would a counter measure be, and\n\n241\n00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:12.460\nwhat would it be less, equal to, or more\nexpensive than allowing the risk to occur?\n\n242\n00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.660\nNow this may sound simple on\nthe surface but it's not so simple.\n\n243\n00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.820\nSo let's talk about what some of\nthe contributory factors are that\n\n244\n00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.270\nwe would have to consider here.\n\n245\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.390\nNumber one, how long are we gonna\nown this system that is causing or\n\n246\n00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.690\nallowing this breach to occur\nbefore we get rid of it?\n\n247\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:28.950\nAre we going to keep it for a year?\n\n248\n00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.490\nAre we going to keep it for two years?\n\n249\n00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.188\nAre we keeping it for only three months?\n\n250\n00:13:32.188 --> 00:13:34.230\nBecause it's 1,000 a month.\n\n251\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.615\nSo if I'm gonna get rid of\nthis thing in three months,\n\n252\n00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:40.486\nthen it's not $12,000 that I really\ngotta worry about, it's $3,000,\n\n253\n00:13:40.486 --> 00:13:43.098\nbecause I'm only gonna have it for\nanother three months.\n\n254\n00:13:43.098 --> 00:13:46.720\nHowever, if I'm gonna keep it for\na year, I gotta worry about $12,000.\n\n255\n00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.590\nIf it's gonna be two years,\nI gotta worry about $24,000.\n\n256\n00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.600\nSo the first thing we wanna\nestablish is the timeline or\n\n257\n00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.318\nduration of the viability,\nthe longevity of this system.\n\n258\n00:13:56.318 --> 00:13:57.940\nSo we gotta figure that out.\n\n259\n00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:01.457\nThen the next thing we need to figure out\nis what is a potential counter measure?\n\n260\n00:14:01.457 --> 00:14:05.091\nWell I may find several counter measures\nand they cost different things, so\n\n261\n00:14:05.091 --> 00:14:08.830\nI gotta figure out what the likely\ncounter measures I want to apply.\n\n262\n00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:12.818\nSo let's say that counter\nmeasure's gonna cost me $12,000,\n\n263\n00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:16.333\nmeaning if I can fix the problem\nby spending $12,000,\n\n264\n00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:19.458\nwill that be a good fix is\nessentially what we wanna do.\n\n265\n00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.800\nWe're gonna do what's known as a CBA.\n\n266\n00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.148\nA cost-benefit analysis, right?\n\n267\n00:14:24.148 --> 00:14:28.171\nWe're gonna look at the potential cost and\nthe potential benefit and\n\n268\n00:14:28.171 --> 00:14:31.371\ndecide whether those two are good,\nbad, or neutral.\n\n269\n00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:36.640\nSo the ALE value, $12,000,\nis the outcome if we do nothing per year.\n\n270\n00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.090\nAnd let's say we're going to\nown this system for a year.\n\n271\n00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.420\nSo we have a potential\nliability of $12,000.\n\n272\n00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.361\nWe have a countermeasure that's going\nto cost us 12,000 to implement.\n\n273\n00:14:45.361 --> 00:14:46.410\nSo we do that math.\n\n274\n00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.390\nSo the cost will be 12 if I do nothing.\n\n275\n00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.950\nIf I do something it's gonna\ncost me $12,000 as well.\n\n276\n00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.210\nWell, those two are equal.\n\n277\n00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.220\nBut then I have to add in the fact that\nI'm only gonna own this system for\n\n278\n00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.450\none more year.\n\n279\n00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:00.520\nSo essentially,\nI'm spending $12,000 either way.\n\n280\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.812\nThe question is now if I spend\n$12,000 to fix the problem, right, or\n\n281\n00:15:04.812 --> 00:15:08.382\nif I spend $12,000 just by\nletting the problem happen.\n\n282\n00:15:08.382 --> 00:15:12.522\nNow the question becomes will that counter\nmeasure yield additional benefits to me.\n\n283\n00:15:12.522 --> 00:15:17.529\nMeaning, will that counter measure as\na $12,000 investment against the problem,\n\n284\n00:15:17.529 --> 00:15:20.725\nbe able to be used in other\nareas to offset other concerns.\n\n285\n00:15:20.725 --> 00:15:23.430\nIf the answer is yes,\nit's actually good investment.\n\n286\n00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:26.340\nBecause I'm spending 12 either way,\nbut I'm getting more value for\n\n287\n00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.025\nthe 12 I spend on the counter measure.\n\n288\n00:15:28.025 --> 00:15:33.290\nIf the answer is no, it's essentially a\nwash, I may not wanna make the investment.\n\n289\n00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:37.260\nBecause I'll be willing to bet that number\none, the breach may not happen like\n\n290\n00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:41.130\nclockwork every month, so\nI may not really spend $12000 over a year.\n\n291\n00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:45.024\nThe bad actors, in other words, may get\nbored and go on vacation and miss me for\n\n292\n00:15:45.024 --> 00:15:46.331\na month, I may get lucky.\n\n293\n00:15:46.331 --> 00:15:51.602\nNumber two, that counter measure that I\napply has hidden costs associated with it.\n\n294\n00:15:51.602 --> 00:15:54.130\nI gotta train people to use it and\nset it up.\n\n295\n00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:55.555\nI gotta manage it and maintain it.\n\n296\n00:15:55.555 --> 00:15:58.233\nI gotta worry about licensing it or\nlearn those what.\n\n297\n00:15:58.233 --> 00:16:01.773\nAnd there may be more than $12,000 in\nfees associated with deploying it.\n\n298\n00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:03.314\nSo it may not be a good deal.\n\n299\n00:16:03.314 --> 00:16:06.626\nSo as a CCSP,\nwe've gotta walk through the math here.\n\n300\n00:16:06.626 --> 00:16:10.114\nAnd really try to figure out\nquantitatively whether putting in\n\n301\n00:16:10.114 --> 00:16:14.387\na countermeasure that is equal to the\nexpense of the problem, is a good idea or\n\n302\n00:16:14.387 --> 00:16:17.220\nwhether it's maybe not such a good idea.\n\n303\n00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.390\nIf I'm gonna keep the system for\nlonger than 12 months,\n\n304\n00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:22.500\nit's probably gonna pay for itself and\nit's gonna be a good investment.\n\n305\n00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.930\nIf I'm gonna keep it for less,\nunless there's a hidden cost there and\n\n306\n00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.670\na hidden benefit to go with\nit that I'm not assessing,\n\n307\n00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.730\nI may not be able to truly\nunderstand the value.\n\n308\n00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.440\nAnd they may not perceive\nwhat the actual value is.\n\n309\n00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.160\nSo we have to understand these things\nas part of doing risk assessment and\n\n310\n00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.260\nrisk analysis also very important.\n\n311\n00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:43.420\nWe want to think about the value of\nthe BIA, the Business Impact Assessment,\n\n312\n00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.990\nthat we talked about doing with regards\nto risk assessment and risk analysis.\n\n313\n00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:50.870\nIt helps us to prioritize the important\nsystems in the organization and\n\n314\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.270\nshows us where we should be making\nthese investments and whether or\n\n315\n00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.980\nnot the system that we are counter\nmeasuring with a $12,000 investment\n\n316\n00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:59.840\nis a mainline important system.\n\n317\n00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.100\nOr maybe we can afford to turn\nit off when we're not using it.\n\n318\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.120\nKeep it on for two days a month and\n\n319\n00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.280\nin that two day window maybe we don't\nexperience that $1000 potential hit.\n\n320\n00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.370\nSo maybe we're mitigating the $12,000\nexpense by re-classifying the system and\n\n321\n00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:18.360\nsaying it's not prioritized high enough\nto keep on and manage all the time.\n\n322\n00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.760\nMaybe that in and\nof itself will be a good counter-measure.\n\n323\n00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.170\nThat costs us nothing except for\na little brain power or\n\n324\n00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.400\nprobably a couple of bucks for\nsome caffeine, right.\n\n325\n00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.980\nSo, that's going to be a lot cheaper\nthan spending $12,000, right?\n\n326\n00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.080\nBuy me a Mountain Dew,\ngive me a cup of coffee and,\n\n327\n00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.450\nyou know, we'll be good, right?\n\n328\n00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.780\nSo, critical aspects of risk\nassessment really we have to understand\n\n329\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:39.880\nwhat the prioritized ranking of\nthe system and the risks are.\n\n330\n00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.900\nWe have to understand the cost of owning\nthe system and the risk of operating it.\n\n331\n00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.270\nWe have to understand the cost\nof not doing anything and\n\n332\n00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.790\njust letting it run its course.\n\n333\n00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:52.320\nWe have to asses all these things in order\nto understand, ultimately, what will or\n\n334\n00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.450\nwill not happen.\n\n335\n00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.970\nWe have to think about our response and\nis our response going to be appropriate?\n\n336\n00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:58.160\nIs it going to be more expensive or\n\n337\n00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.210\nless expensive than the counter\nmeasures we've talked about.\n\n338\n00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.740\nAnd we've talked about traditional\nways to deal with risk, right?\n\n339\n00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.860\nAcceptance, avoidance,\ntransference and/or mitigation.\n\n340\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.860\nRemember, acceptance of risk involves\ndocumenting the risk, writing it down,\n\n341\n00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.370\nand having senior\nmanagement sign off on it,\n\n342\n00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.080\nto validate that the risk is actually\ngoing to be acceptable to the business.\n\n343\n00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.420\nAt least,\nthat's what it should involve anyway.\n\n344\n00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.160\nRisk avoidance involves changing behavior\nand getting out of that line of business,\n\n345\n00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.460\ngetting rid of that system,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n346\n00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:32.450\nRisk transference, classic example would\nbe buying insurance and/or offloading\n\n347\n00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:36.640\nrisk to the Cloud by deciding to pay a\nCloud vendor to run your systems for you.\n\n348\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.580\nBoth are classic examples\nof risk transference.\n\n349\n00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.850\nAnd then risk mitigation is\nminimization activities, right?\n\n350\n00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.150\nWhat are we gonna do to manage\nrisk down in the organization.\n\n351\n00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.950\nBut remember,\nwe always have risks that are left over.\n\n352\n00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.980\nWe have residual risk, right?\n\n353\n00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.270\nWe're never gonna get rid of all risk.\n\n354\n00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.870\nWe strive to get to a zero risk solution,\nbut\n\n355\n00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.050\nit is highly unlikely\nthat we will get there.\n\n356\n00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.690\nAnd so we do want to understand that and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n357\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.990\nResidual risk plays a very important\npart in what we are doing.\n\n358\n00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:07.190\nAnd finally, risk monitoring has to\nbe ongoing, it has to be a consistent\n\n359\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:11.530\nsolution that is applied holistically\nacross the entire organization.\n\n360\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:15.150\nTo understand the impacts of risk and to\nmake sure we are managing the appropriate\n\n361\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:19.610\nrisk and dealing with the appropriate,\npotential exposure that may occur so\n\n362\n00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.980\nit'd be very, very important for\nus to think about that as well.\n\n363\n00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:26.974\n>> Well Adam, risk is all around us,\n[CROSSTALK] I like that, it's ubiquitous,\n\n364\n00:19:26.974 --> 00:19:29.420\nwe've been using\n>> Large words today.\n\n365\n00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.480\nTrying to\n>> I can't spell

00:19:41.310\nwhen it comes to risk that's something\nwe don't want to play around with.\n\n371\n00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:44.850\nThat is something we have to get behind,\nwe have to really,\n\n372\n00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.080\nobviously put our focus on because if we\ncan't, if we don't see a risk coming,\n\n373\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.310\nif we don't take the time to find out,\nokay every little angle of\n\n374\n00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.070\nwhat could possibly detriment our company,\nour environment, whatever the case may be.\n\n375\n00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:01.870\nThen we're basically setting ourselves\nup to have those things happen and\n\n376\n00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.230\nthen we can't cry and\ngo woe was me, how poor am I.\n\n377\n00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:08.610\nWhen they do occur, you're gonna have\nsomebody pointing a finger going\n\n378\n00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.860\nwhy didn't try to avoid these things,\nhow come you didn't take the steps\n\n379\n00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.550\nthat are pervasive around us that\nhelp us not have these things happen.\n\n380\n00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.780\nSo that's what we wanna do, that's why\nwe're trying to bring this up to you.\n\n381\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.700\nAdam, you did a great job of showing\nus ways that we can do that.\n\n382\n00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.900\nHow do we get in front of that and\nnot allow those things to occur to us,\n\n383\n00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.870\nusing things like the quantitative\nanalysis, putting a dollar sign on it.\n\n384\n00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:33.180\n>> Yeah, sure.\n>> I can go to a manager and\n\n385\n00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:37.490\nsay, \"I'm gonna save us $15,000 a year,\n$20,000 a year or\n\n386\n00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:40.620\nmaybe leave it alone,\nit's not worth the effort.\n\n387\n00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.350\nYou're gonna pay me more money\nfiguring out how to fix it\n\n388\n00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.000\nthen you are just to let it occur.\n\n389\n00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.890\nThese are the kinds of things\nwe got to look out for, so\n\n390\n00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.910\nkeep that in mind as you work as a CCSP\nand prepare for the exam as well.\n\n391\n00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.090\nBecause they might even throw a question\nor two like that out on the exam.\n\n392\n00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.820\n>> In theory,\nit's always possible that can happen.\n\n393\n00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:01.120\nWe never know, of course, and we can\nnever see definitively, even if we do.\n\n394\n00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.250\nBut we do want to think about\nthe fact that clearly risk is so\n\n395\n00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.080\nimportant, so pervasive, so\npart of what we do all the time,\n\n396\n00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.670\nand we've seen it in almost every\ndiscussion, every episode we've had,\n\n397\n00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.950\nwe've mentioned that word and\ntalked about it at lengths in some way.\n\n398\n00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:17.910\nThat should be a hint, an indication\nto you of its importance to us and,\n\n399\n00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.090\nas a result, obviously,\nclearly, its importance to you.\n\n400\n00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.490\nMeaning that you should be prepared\nto talk knowledgeably about,\n\n401\n00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.330\nas Daniel has said, and\nto answer questions knowledgeably\n\n402\n00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.060\nabout risk in any and all forms, wherever\nyou see them, if the opportunity arises.\n\n403\n00:21:30.060

about risk\n\n405\n00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.600\nand, like Adam said here,\nthat this is a hint to you.\n\n406\n00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.130\nWe've been discussing it and this is\nthe culmination of that discussion and\n\n407\n00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:45.080\nwe are gonna go sign off for today though.\n\n408\n00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.050\nHopefully you've enjoyed the episode.\n\n409\n00:21:46.050

another\ngreat episode of ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:21.214\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and in today's\nepisode we're actually completing our\n\n5\n00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:25.550\nlook at the certified cloud security\nprofessional, and joining us today,\n\n6\n00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.170\nto finish that effort,\nis our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.610\nAdam, welcome back to the show.\n\n8\n00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.440\nHow is it going?\n\n9\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.050\n>> How do, how do.\n\n10\n00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.720\n>> It goes fine?\n\n11\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.550\n>> It goes well.\n\n12\n00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.590\nIt goes well.\n\n13\n00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.578\n>> There you go.\n\n14\n00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:40.330\n>> So as Daniel said, we will be wrapping\nup our conversations here with you.\n\n15\n00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.170\nLooking forward,\n\n16\n00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.530\nobviously, to putting this particular\nepisode into context with all the others.\n\n17\n00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.920\nWe do have some stuff we want\nto complete before we wrap up.\n\n18\n00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.300\nSo let's talk a little bit about the ideas\nbehind understanding the collection and\n\n19\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.610\npreservation of digital evidence.\n\n20\n00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.920\nWe have to first really identify and\nunderstand the concepts of forensic\n\n21\n00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.450\nscience and digital forensics,\ndifferentiate between the two.\n\n22\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.610\nForensic science is the application\nof science to the law.\n\n23\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.810\nAnd digital forensics is the idea\nof the application of science to\n\n24\n00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.630\nthe identification,\ncollection, examination and\n\n25\n00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.350\nanalysis of data, while preserving\nthe integrity of that information.\n\n26\n00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.600\nAnd maintaining a strict chain of\ncustody with regards to that data.\n\n27\n00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.410\nSo when we think of practicing\nforensics in the cloud,\n\n28\n00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.450\nwe think about digital forensics,\nnot forensic science.\n\n29\n00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.570\nForensic science is the concept of\nmaking sure that we are using science\n\n30\n00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.110\nto the fullest extent possible to further\nour investigations under the law.\n\n31\n00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.120\nBut really, digital forensics is\nwhat we are going to engage in.\n\n32\n00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.510\nThere are challenges associated\nwith cloud forensics.\n\n33\n00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.065\nWe have to think about who controls\nthe data, as we've often spoken about.\n\n34\n00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.160\nMulti-tendency makes it harder for\nus to investigate and\n\n35\n00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.630\ngather evidence cleanly and easily.\n\n36\n00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.640\nData volatility has never gone away.\n\n37\n00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.590\nThe cloud just amplifies that,\ndata is still volatile.\n\n38\n00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.790\nIt just may be tougher to get to,\n\n39\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.670\nand tougher to actually then take\ncontrol of in a meaningful way.\n\n40\n00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.840\nAnd evidence acquisition is complex in\nthe cloud, because we may be dealing with\n\n41\n00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.100\nthird parties that control\nthe physical infrastructure.\n\n42\n00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.410\nAnd we have to rely on\nthem to give us access.\n\n43\n00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.710\nSo to do this on our behalf.\n\n44\n00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.540\nAnd we may or\n\n45\n00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.240\nmay not know how forensically sound their\nevidence gathering capabilities are.\n\n46\n00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.170\nAre they trained the appropriate way?\n\n47\n00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.800\nDo they have the appropriate skills?\n\n48\n00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.238\nThese are big challenges we would\nhave to worry about and be aware of.\n\n49\n00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:27.718\nData access is really gonna be limited and\nconstraint by the service model.\n\n50\n00:02:27.718 --> 00:02:31.669\nIS pass versus SAAS, this theme we come\nback to and return over and over and\n\n51\n00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:36.080\nover again right, we have to think about\nthe implications and the concerns.\n\n52\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.870\nRemember with the SAAS model we as the\ncustomer control the input of the data but\n\n53\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.550\nthe cloud provider essentially\nmanages the entire back end.\n\n54\n00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.780\nWe wanna forensically examine that system.\n\n55\n00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.910\nWe have to go to them.\n\n56\n00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.910\nThere's no two ways about it.\n\n57\n00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.070\nWe have no visibility into the matters\nfrom the plane at all, no control over\n\n58\n00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.920\nthe data once it goes into the system\nexcept that ultimately we own it or\n\n59\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.310\nwe can pull it out.\n\n60\n00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.110\nBut everything in between\nis managed by the provider\n\n61\n00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.380\nwhereas in an IS platform\nwe have oversight and\n\n62\n00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.110\ncontrol capabilities over the hardware\nas well as the software running on it.\n\n63\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.810\nWe're at the opposite end of the spectrum.\n\n64\n00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.505\nSo we are gonna see the management plan.\n\n65\n00:03:10.505 --> 00:03:12.245\nAt least part of it, anyway.\n\n66\n00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:15.395\nWe are gonna be exposed to\nthe network configurations and\n\n67\n00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:20.115\nthe management of that information flow is\ngonna be partly our responsibility, but\n\n68\n00:03:20.115 --> 00:03:22.225\nalso partly the responsibility\nof the provider.\n\n69\n00:03:22.225 --> 00:03:26.175\nAnd so we do have to understand that there\nmay be a shared issue and concern here.\n\n70\n00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:29.015\nAnd of course passed it's roughly\nat the crossroads in the middle\n\n71\n00:03:29.015 --> 00:03:30.345\non both sides of this divide.\n\n72\n00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:31.745\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n73\n00:03:31.745 --> 00:03:33.065\nAlso legal systems.\n\n74\n00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:35.940\nWhere a country or in the country,\nthe legal system of the country\n\n75\n00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.320\nas we talked about in prior discussions,\nwhere the data is stored plays a part with\n\n76\n00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.989\nregards to a kind forensic examination,\nwhat kind of capabilities, and\n\n77\n00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.085\nultimately what activities we\ncan engage in under the law.\n\n78\n00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:52.385\nI'm just trying to think about\nthe best way to say that.\n\n79\n00:03:52.385 --> 00:03:55.155\nThank you for jumping in there and\noffering me some help there, sir,\n\n80\n00:03:55.155 --> 00:03:57.125\nas I floundered in\nthe deep end of the pool.\n\n81\n00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:57.888\nI appreciate you.\n>> I got your back.\n\n82\n00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:00.200\nWay back [LAUGH].\n\n83\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.930\n>> Apparently standing\noff to the side way back.\n\n84\n00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.132\nYou should be thankful that, I gave you\nthe time to play your video game there.\n\n85\n00:04:08.132 --> 00:04:10.060\nAs opposed to be helping\nme out while we're talking.\n\n86\n00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.850\nI'm only kidding,\nhe's not fooling around over there.\n\n87\n00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.640\nHe's paying attention\nto what we're doing and\n\n88\n00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.750\nDan was keeping a good job of making notes\nand obviously keeping me on target and\n\n89\n00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.110\non task with the things\nthat we want to talk about.\n\n90\n00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.650\nSpeaking of notes, did you prepare\nthat graphic we talked about?\n\n91\n00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.270\n>> I prepared every graphic\nyou asked me to do.\n\n92\n00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.695\n>> You have no graphics, you are lying,\nyou are lying like a rug.\n\n93\n00:04:26.695 --> 00:04:27.565\nWe have no graphics for\n\n94\n00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:30.917\nthis particular exercise but\nDaniel's obviously gonna jump in here.\n\n95\n00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:33.125\nI am gonna ask him to help me with\nsomething in just a couple minutes.\n\n96\n00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:36.875\nSo do stand ready sir, I will be\nasking for something momentarily.\n\n97\n00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:39.797\nAll right so forensics readiness\nis gonna be very important for us.\n\n98\n00:04:39.797 --> 00:04:44.947\nAs a cloud certified security\nprofessional, thinking as a CCSP,\n\n99\n00:04:44.947 --> 00:04:48.967\nare we thinking about the ways we gather\nevidence, are we going to deal with that\n\n100\n00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:52.768\nevidence forensically in a way that allows\nus to establish a chain of custody.\n\n101\n00:04:52.768 --> 00:04:55.758\nAre we going to make sure we\nhave the capability to do so?\n\n102\n00:04:55.758 --> 00:04:57.928\nWe have to think about all\nthe things that go into this, right?\n\n103\n00:04:57.928 --> 00:05:00.548\nWe still have to do all\nthe common sense things we do.\n\n104\n00:05:00.548 --> 00:05:04.468\nWe still have to go ahead and make sure we\ngather dynamic evidence in a way that does\n\n105\n00:05:04.468 --> 00:05:08.228\nnot modify it, but allows us to capture\nthat evidence so we can use it.\n\n106\n00:05:08.228 --> 00:05:12.008\nWe have to use hashing to create\nintegrity checks for our data.\n\n107\n00:05:12.008 --> 00:05:15.708\nWe have to ensure that we\nare establishing a chain of custody.\n\n108\n00:05:15.708 --> 00:05:19.400\nWe have to ensure that we are handling\nthat evidence by signing in and\n\n109\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.980\nout every time we gotta use it.\n\n110\n00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.370\nWe have to take a fresh wish sound image\nof that evidence, if it's a hard drive or\n\n111\n00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.600\nsome kind of data.\n\n112\n00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.510\nWe then have to hash that,\nstore that, and then use the copy\n\n113\n00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.170\nin order to be able to do the forensic\nexamination of the original data itself.\n\n114\n00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.712\nSo that way there is no question\nabout the modification of the data.\n\n115\n00:05:36.712 --> 00:05:39.260\nSo there's all these things that\nwe would have to go through,\n\n116\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.502\nwe'd have to think about.\n\n117\n00:05:40.502 --> 00:05:43.950\nLet's talk about the digital forensic\nphases we should engage in here for\n\n118\n00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.710\njust a minute.\n\n119\n00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.600\nCould you take a note,\n\n120\n00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.270\nthis is actually what I was gonna ask\nyou helping with all kidding aside.\n\n121\n00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.060\nCan you either put up Wordpad or\nNotepad or Word or\n\n122\n00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.440\nI don't know, some sort of a Mac-centered\ndocument-capture system that you run on\n\n123\n00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.660\nthat crazy computer of yours but something\nwhere we can make a note real quick.\n\n124\n00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.440\nI just want you to write down a four-step\nprocess and just capture the steps for\n\n125\n00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.700\nus as we go through.\n\n126\n00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.230\n>> Sure.\n\n127\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.100\n>> Okay, are you ready to do that?\n\n128\n00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.750\n>> I'm ready to go.\n\n129\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.790\n>> Outstanding, so\nif we can just do this real quick?\n\n130\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:09.250\nOkay good.\n\n131\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.380\nSo step number one is collection.\n\n132\n00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.650\nSo look at that it even pops up in blue,\n\n133\n00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.580\nauto completes, I don't even need you\nhere, turn on the voice recognition.\n\n134\n00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.070\nYou could go home I'll talk to this thing.\n\n135\n00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.482\n>> Signing off for IT Pro TV everyone.\n\n136\n00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.455\n[LAUGH]\n>> It'll do it for me that's outstanding,\n\n137\n00:06:25.455 --> 00:06:28.459\nall right so\nstep number two is gonna be examination.\n\n138\n00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.820\nThere we go, good, just go with\nthe spell-check, it's always right.\n\n139\n00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.805\nStep number three, analysis and\nstep number four is reporting.\n\n140\n00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:45.780\n[SOUND] All right very good and so\nthe phases of digital forensics right is\n\n141\n00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:50.285\nreally what we are outlining here, we're\ngonna collect evidence first where we\n\n142\n00:06:50.285 --> 00:06:54.721\ngonna go out and find the evidence, bring\nit in, make sure we are capturing it,\n\n143\n00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:59.318\nwe're securing it Nothing's gonna happen\nto it, it's not gonna get modified.\n\n144\n00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:00.550\nThen we're gonna examine it.\n\n145\n00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.800\nWe're gonna take it back to a lab\nunder controlled conditions.\n\n146\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.070\nWe're gonna look at it, make sure we\nunderstand what is and is not there.\n\n147\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.750\nSo we're gonna start to examine.\n\n148\n00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.660\nWe're gonna analyze.\n\n149\n00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.460\nWe're gonna look at what we\nhave found through examination.\n\n150\n00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.560\nWe're gonna figure out whether or\nnot this tells us something important.\n\n151\n00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.810\nAnd then we're gonna gather our findings\nand report them out to interested parties,\n\n152\n00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.130\nwhoever they may be.\n\n153\n00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.200\nSo when we think about collection,\nwe have to develop a plan that, obviously,\n\n154\n00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.460\nallows us to acquire the data\nin a forensically sound way.\n\n155\n00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:32.310\nWe have to acquire the data, and then we\nhave to verify the integrity of the data.\n\n156\n00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.900\nSo, if you go up to collection,\nunder collection, maybe sub-step, like,\n\n157\n00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.880\nyou know, one, and\ncan you do a tab and do that?\n\n158\n00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.940\n>> Yeah.\n>> Okay so\n\n159\n00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.120\nunder there we would\nwant to put acquire data.\n\n160\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.500\nRight, so acquire data.\n\n161\n00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.650\nAnd then another one under that,\nif you could,\n\n162\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.060\nlike another substep, we would\nwanna do verify integrity of data.\n\n163\n00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:52.740\nRight, this would also be important.\n\n164\n00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:57.080\nWhen we think about,\njust while you're finishing typing,\n\n165\n00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.720\nwhen we think about collection\nof evidence and the challenges.\n\n166\n00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.805\nThe challenges really occur\nin these areas, right?\n\n167\n00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:04.634\nCuz if we don't acquire the data properly,\nif we don't,\n\n168\n00:08:04.634 --> 00:08:07.314\nin other words,\nuse forensically sound mechanisms.\n\n169\n00:08:07.314 --> 00:08:08.834\nThat we may have corrupt data.\n\n170\n00:08:08.834 --> 00:08:13.237\nIf we are not careful, the very act of\ncollecting data itself may actually modify\n\n171\n00:08:13.237 --> 00:08:15.062\nthe data in other words, right?\n\n172\n00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:18.626\nWe go to create a bit stream copy,\nan image of a hard drive, if we don't use\n\n173\n00:08:18.626 --> 00:08:22.423\na write blocker, a device that essentially\nprevents write back to the drive,\n\n174\n00:08:22.423 --> 00:08:26.185\nthen we're going to modify the data in\nreal time while we're collecting it.\n\n175\n00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:30.657\nBecause as I'm sure you probably know and\nI'm sure a lot of our listeners know,\n\n176\n00:08:30.657 --> 00:08:35.457\nwhen you access a system file, you modify\nthe date and timestamp of last access.\n\n177\n00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:38.107\nEssentially you are changing the metadata\n\n178\n00:08:38.107 --> 00:08:42.147\nas well as potentially actual data on\nthat file in realtime by accessing it.\n\n179\n00:08:42.147 --> 00:08:44.267\nWell, every time we copy a file,\nwe access it.\n\n180\n00:08:44.267 --> 00:08:46.090\nWe're gonna modify the date and\ntimestamps.\n\n181\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.720\nThat act in and\n\n182\n00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.290\nof itself essentially renders the data\nunusable from a forensics standpoint.\n\n183\n00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:55.180\nSo we use this idea and this hardware\ndevice called a write blocker\n\n184\n00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.180\nthat allows us to essentially copy\none way but not make changes back, so\n\n185\n00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.840\nit's a read only as opposed\nto read write activity.\n\n186\n00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.440\nWe're sucking data out of the system but\nnot allowing us to put data back.\n\n187\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.980\nSo we have to think about this as one of\nthe key things that would happen there.\n\n188\n00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.090\nUnder Verify Integrity of data, maybe just\nin parenthesis right next to it there,\n\n189\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:16.310\njust put, we'd wanna do hashing, right?\n\n190\n00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.890\nCuz hashing will help us to identify and\nto create the integrity of the data.\n\n191\n00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:24.700\nAnd up under Acquire Data, right at\nthe end of it there, in brackets or\n\n192\n00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.623\nparenthesis probably put (use of write\nblocker) as in W-R-I-T-E, write blocker.\n\n193\n00:09:29.623 --> 00:09:31.164\nSo we'd wanna use a write blocker.\n\n194\n00:09:31.164 --> 00:09:33.340\nRight, so\nthat'll just be some helpful notes there.\n\n195\n00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.305\nSo wanna be thinking about that, right?\n\n196\n00:09:35.305 --> 00:09:37.935\nWanna make sure that if we're\ngoing out to seize data,\n\n197\n00:09:37.935 --> 00:09:40.519\nhere's another potential\nliability concern here.\n\n198\n00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:45.348\nWe show up on site at the cloud\nprovider's data center and we seize data,\n\n199\n00:09:45.348 --> 00:09:48.846\nwe show up with a discovery order and\na search order.\n\n200\n00:09:48.846 --> 00:09:51.412\nAnd we say we want all data\npertaining to ACME corporation and\n\n201\n00:09:51.412 --> 00:09:55.085\nwe're gonna seize all the servers that\ndata's on, and the cloud provider says,\n\n202\n00:09:55.085 --> 00:09:57.830\nhold on, wait a second,\nthis is a multi-tenant environment.\n\n203\n00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.110\nYou seize those servers,\n\n204\n00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.170\nyou're seizing a whole bunch of\nother company's data as well.\n\n205\n00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.830\nThat's a potential issue.\n\n206\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.560\nThat court order may or\nmay not have addressed that.\n\n207\n00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.330\nThat court order may allow us to seize\nthe servers irrespective of what other\n\n208\n00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.000\ninfrastructure may be part of that.\n\n209\n00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.090\nSo that could obviously\nbe a very big issue.\n\n210\n00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.380\nWe may be essentially caught up right\nin that dragnet without even realizing\n\n211\n00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.350\nthat we are liable for\nthat or subject to that.\n\n212\n00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.430\nMicrosoft's actually engaged in some\nreally interesting activity right now.\n\n213\n00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.830\nIn this general area, they have brought\nsuit against the United States federal\n\n214\n00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.860\nGovernment over the last few days,\n\n215\n00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.590\nso we are now sitting here roughly in\nthe middle of April, right, of 2016.\n\n216\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:42.010\nAnd as a result of the Apple FBI fiasco\nthat went on, they have actually\n\n217\n00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.590\njumped in and have brought suit in federal\ncourt to sue the federal government.\n\n218\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.810\nBecause they, Microsoft, are concerned\nabout the fact that the federal\n\n219\n00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.560\ngovernment is trying to get tech companies\nlike Apple and potentially Microsoft and\n\n220\n00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:01.940\nothers to allow unrestricted\naccess to data on demand,\n\n221\n00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.800\neither through a FISA order, or\nsome other order in the United States.\n\n222\n00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.540\nThat part they're a little fuzzy on.\n\n223\n00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.440\nWell maybe we'll comply, maybe we won't.\n\n224\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.270\nBut the issue Microsoft is\ndragging them into court over\n\n225\n00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.810\nis the fact that the government maintains\nthat the tech vendor has no right, and\n\n226\n00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.900\nno responsibility and\n\n227\n00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:24.420\nno ability to be able to notify the people\nthat are being the subject of that search.\n\n228\n00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.890\nEven after the search has occurred, even\nif maybe they are not even found to be\n\n229\n00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.190\na party of interest, the government says,\nhey, national security.\n\n230\n00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.119\nCan't talk about it at all,\ncan't notify anybody.\n\n231\n00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:36.390\nMicrosoft challenging them in court,\nand saying you know what?\n\n232\n00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.570\nThat's unacceptable.\n\n233\n00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.160\nAnd this is an issue we talked about in\na prior episode with regards to ownership.\n\n234\n00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.720\nYou remember we talked about data\nownership, and we talked about the data\n\n235\n00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.860\nowner, the data custodian,\nthe data processor, etc, etc, etc.\n\n236\n00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.580\nAnd you specifically drew me out on,\nhey, so what if we have data and\n\n237\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.180\nwe own it as the user with the right\nto be forgotten, the data subject.\n\n238\n00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.447\nBut what if somebody else is gonna have\nthat data, do they own it as well?\n\n239\n00:11:58.447 --> 00:12:00.110\nWe went through that whole dialogue.\n\n240\n00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.188\nThey're actually suing around this exact\nidea, because what Microsoft is saying\n\n241\n00:12:04.188 --> 00:12:08.147\nis essentially, look, this data is owned\nby the individual and you have no right\n\n242\n00:12:08.147 --> 00:12:12.073\nunder the US Constitution, which is\nactually the really cool part about this.\n\n243\n00:12:12.073 --> 00:12:16.887\nYou have no right under the US\nConstitution to force us through some sort\n\n244\n00:12:16.887 --> 00:12:20.335\nof legal compliance in\nthe court to issue an order,\n\n245\n00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:24.286\nto give you access to this data and\nthen not tell the owner.\n\n246\n00:12:24.286 --> 00:12:26.225\nNot that you can't tell\nus to give you access,\n\n247\n00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:27.877\nthey're not saying we can't comply.\n\n248\n00:12:27.877 --> 00:12:31.019\nThey're saying, hey, you may make us\ncomply but we have to fess up and\n\n249\n00:12:31.019 --> 00:12:34.272\ntell the owner, because the owner\nhas rights to the data, because it's\n\n250\n00:12:34.272 --> 00:12:37.762\nconsidered to be privileged or\nprotected property under the Constitution.\n\n251\n00:12:37.762 --> 00:12:42.240\nAnd you can't search and seize without\nnotification under the Constitution.\n\n252\n00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.230\nAnd so it's a very interesting legal claim\nthat they're trying to play out here.\n\n253\n00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.016\nWe're gonna see how this\nultimately progresses.\n\n254\n00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:48.250\nThey've just brought suit,\n\n255\n00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.050\nso it's gonna be awhile before this\nworks its way through the courts.\n\n256\n00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.380\nBut literally, while we are talking\nabout this over the last couple of days,\n\n257\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.560\ndoing shows and episodes for\n\n258\n00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:58.970\nyou, this is all evolving and\nactually has come to fruition.\n\n259\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.590\nSo it's really kind of interesting\nwhen we talk about some of the stuff,\n\n260\n00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:04.060\nthat it's happening for\nreal, in the real world,\n\n261\n00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.250\nin real time as we're helping\nyou to understand this stuff.\n\n262\n00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.970\nThis stuff's playing out and\nbecoming real right in front of our eyes.\n\n263\n00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.660\nI'm actually looking forward to\nseeing what happens with this case,\n\n264\n00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:14.330\npretty cool concept.\n\n265\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.881\n>> So they're trying to do this without\nany kind of warrant, they just wanna say,\n\n266\n00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:19.740\nI want access-\n>> They are doing it.\n\n267\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.560\n>> They have been doing it under FISA.\n\n268\n00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.682\nThey have been doing it through\nthe FISA court for some time.\n\n269\n00:13:23.682 --> 00:13:28.719\nUnder the PATRIOT Act the US government,\nat least in the US anyway, has the rights\n\n270\n00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:33.318\nunder one of several special provisions\nto go out to the FISA courts, which\n\n271\n00:13:33.318 --> 00:13:37.917\nare the courts that rule on essentially\na request to go into the wire tap, or\n\n272\n00:13:37.917 --> 00:13:42.735\nto go in and to gain access to electronic\ndata of various kinds under the claim or\n\n273\n00:13:42.735 --> 00:13:45.230\nthe guise of national security.\n\n274\n00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.080\nThis is an outgrowth\nof the PATRIOT Act and\n\n275\n00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.420\nthis has been going on for\nover a decade, right?\n\n276\n00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.650\nAnd this is not new,\nand this is not secret.\n\n277\n00:13:52.650 --> 00:13:55.890\nThe issue now that Microsoft and\nother tech companies are starting to\n\n278\n00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:59.620\nwrestle with is you've been telling us\nto do this, we've been complying, but\n\n279\n00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.220\nyou've been essentially\nissuing a gag order on us.\n\n280\n00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.890\nAnd telling us we're not allowed to\ntell the subject of that search,\n\n281\n00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.300\neven after you find that they're innocent\nor have no culpability, we're never\n\n282\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.250\nallowed to go back and tell them that\nwe had to do this with their data.\n\n283\n00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.710\nThe problem is we're not\nthe owner of the data, right?\n\n284\n00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.340\nThe data subject is and\nyou're essentially telling us\n\n285\n00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:20.380\nthat we have to give you that access and\nnot notify the owner.\n\n286\n00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.285\nAnd in theory,\nlegally under the Constitution of the US,\n\n287\n00:14:23.285 --> 00:14:26.916\nthat may be a violation of one or\nmore of the clauses of the Constitution.\n\n288\n00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:30.997\nSo it's just a very interesting approach\nthat they're taking to try to come up with\n\n289\n00:14:30.997 --> 00:14:33.640\nsome sort of negotiated\nmiddle ground here, right?\n\n290\n00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.392\nTo maybe say, look, we're gonna have\nto comply, we're gonna have to give you\n\n291\n00:14:37.392 --> 00:14:40.545\naccess, but you're gonna have to\ndo your part and tell somebody.\n\n292\n00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:43.339\nMaybe not at the time, cuz you obviously\nhave natural security concerns.\n\n293\n00:14:43.339 --> 00:14:45.901\nYou don't want this person finding out,\nright,\n\n294\n00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:50.049\npotentially that they're the subject of\ninvestigation and God forbid go out and\n\n295\n00:14:50.049 --> 00:14:52.989\ndo something and\naccelerate their activities, right?\n\n296\n00:14:52.989 --> 00:14:56.647\nAnd maybe create a problem where there was\nnot one or would not have been one before,\n\n297\n00:14:56.647 --> 00:14:58.016\nwe don't want that to happen.\n\n298\n00:14:58.016 --> 00:15:01.484\nI don't think anybody's saying, nor\nis Microsoft or anyone involved is saying\n\n299\n00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:03.932\nthat would be the outcome we\nwant as a result of this case.\n\n300\n00:15:03.932 --> 00:15:05.807\nBut what they are saying\nis at a certain point,\n\n301\n00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:08.741\nyou're gonna have to tell these people\nthat you were snooping around and\n\n302\n00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:10.825\nlooking at their stuff and\nyou're not doing that.\n\n303\n00:15:10.825 --> 00:15:14.923\nAnd they're trying to compel that argument\nand see if ultimately if it winds up at\n\n304\n00:15:14.923 --> 00:15:19.143\nthe Supreme Court, whether or not the\ncourt essentially interprets this argument\n\n305\n00:15:19.143 --> 00:15:23.146\nin a way that is favorable to the tech\ncompanies, which essentially says yes.\n\n306\n00:15:23.146 --> 00:15:26.962\nUnder the Constitution, the government\nhas potentially the right under\n\n307\n00:15:26.962 --> 00:15:29.249\nthe PATRIOT Act and\nFISA to come and do this.\n\n308\n00:15:29.249 --> 00:15:33.634\nBut they also have an obligation,\na responsibility, to act with due care and\n\n309\n00:15:33.634 --> 00:15:35.600\ndue diligence and then to notify.\n\n310\n00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.490\nAnd the right to notify is really\nthe question that is at the heart of this.\n\n311\n00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.020\nIt's gonna be kind of interesting to see.\n\n312\n00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.350\nWe'll see how that plays out, but\nwe'll have to think about that, right, so.\n\n313\n00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:45.460\n>> It's not enough to\nagree with Big Brother.\n\n314\n00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.852\nYou must love Big Brother [LAUGH].\n\n315\n00:15:46.852 --> 00:15:49.209\n>> Well, I don't know if you\nhave to love Big Brother, but\n\n316\n00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:51.732\nyou have to respect healthily,\nBig Brother's big stick.\n\n317\n00:15:51.732 --> 00:15:54.085\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That's for sure.\n\n318\n00:15:54.085 --> 00:15:55.747\n>> I think that is important\nto understand, right.\n\n319\n00:15:55.747 --> 00:15:58.995\nSo when we are gathering data,\nwe have to think about all these things.\n\n320\n00:15:58.995 --> 00:16:01.065\nWe have to think about all\nthe stuff we just discussed,\n\n321\n00:16:01.065 --> 00:16:02.239\nwhich is an outgrowth of that.\n\n322\n00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:04.492\nWe have to keep a detailed\nlog of everything we do.\n\n323\n00:16:04.492 --> 00:16:06.489\nWe should photograph evidence.\n\n324\n00:16:06.489 --> 00:16:08.029\nAnd again, we may or\nmay not be able to do this.\n\n325\n00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:09.673\nWe may not be the ones collecting it.\n\n326\n00:16:09.673 --> 00:16:13.626\nThe third-party cloud provider that sends\na technician into the data center to\n\n327\n00:16:13.626 --> 00:16:16.530\ngather evidence,\nmay not be forensically trained.\n\n328\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:18.810\nThey may not know that they\nhave to photograph everything.\n\n329\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:21.430\nThe way you see on TV all the time\nwith CSI or something, right?\n\n330\n00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.848\nWhere they show up to the crime scene,\nthey put down the little markers,\n\n331\n00:16:24.848 --> 00:16:26.318\nthey photograph everything.\n\n332\n00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:30.052\nBecause we have to be able to reproduce\nthat evidence in context if it's gonna be\n\n333\n00:16:30.052 --> 00:16:31.960\nconsidered to be legal and admissible.\n\n334\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.960\nAnd in the cloud that's no different.\n\n335\n00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.950\nProblem is in the cloud,\nit may not be a forensically trained\n\n336\n00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.810\nprofessional that's\ngathering the evidence.\n\n337\n00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:43.320\nIt could be whoever is the network\ntech on call, who just got the call.\n\n338\n00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.070\nAnd they say hey,\n\n339\n00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:47.230\ngo out and figure out what's running\non those servers over there.\n\n340\n00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:48.985\nPlug a hard drive in and\nmake a copy of everything.\n\n341\n00:16:48.985 --> 00:16:50.850\nOkay, well you do that,\nyou're done, right?\n\n342\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.510\nYou might as well say there's no evidence,\nbecause you're not gonna get anything\n\n343\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.228\nthat's valuable,\nbecause you can't use any of it.\n\n344\n00:16:55.228 --> 00:16:56.447\nSo we have to understand that.\n\n345\n00:16:56.447 --> 00:17:00.976\nBefore we actually touch a system in any\nway, all of the settings, all the wiring,\n\n346\n00:17:00.976 --> 00:17:05.350\nall of the configuration that we can\nsee on the outside has to be recorded.\n\n347\n00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.100\nSo when we go in to\nforensically examine a system,\n\n348\n00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.470\nwe have to take pictures of the wiring.\n\n349\n00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:13.040\nWe have to take pictures of the front,\nthe side, the back, the top, the bottom.\n\n350\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.850\nWe have to see what color cable was\nplugged in where, and what port.\n\n351\n00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:19.361\nWhere that cable goes to, because we\nhave to reproduce the functionality and\n\n352\n00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:23.100\nthe configuration of the system if asked,\npotentially later, when we testify.\n\n353\n00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:26.631\nSo it's very important, impertant I\nwas gonna say, it's very impertant.\n\n354\n00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:28.625\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's very important to be able to\n\n355\n00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:30.742\nunderstand that these\nthings have to happen.\n\n356\n00:17:30.742 --> 00:17:33.258\nWe also,\nif we’re doing this the right way,\n\n357\n00:17:33.258 --> 00:17:36.982\nshould designate one person as\nan on-scene evidence custodian.\n\n358\n00:17:36.982 --> 00:17:40.246\nSomebody who's gonna be in charge\nof gathering all the evidence being\n\n359\n00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:42.820\nbrought in from the various investigators.\n\n360\n00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.940\nTagging and\nbagging as we often refer to it.\n\n361\n00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.370\nAnd then gathering that evidence up,\n\n362\n00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:49.030\ncoordinating it,\nmaking sure we have an evidence log, and\n\n363\n00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.900\nthen safely transporting that\nevidence back into storage.\n\n364\n00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:52.605\nAnd ultimately then,\n\n365\n00:17:52.605 --> 00:17:56.418\nis gonna be responsible for bringing that\nevidence in under the proper conditions.\n\n366\n00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:58.053\nNot throwing it into\nthe back of your car in\n\n367\n00:17:58.053 --> 00:17:58.960\nthe trunk,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.930\n>> Riding around with it for\n\n369\n00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.380\na week or two, and then remembering,\nI gotta bring that in and\n\n370\n00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.660\nprobably sign that in to\nthe evidence locker, right?\n\n371\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.577\nAfter we've banged that hard drive\naround and bake it for a week or more.\n\n372\n00:18:07.577 --> 00:18:08.308\n>> Covered in cheeseburger grease.\n\n373\n00:18:08.308 --> 00:18:09.527\n>> Cuz there'll be a lot of good\nstuff on there at that point, right?\n\n374\n00:18:09.527 --> 00:18:10.224\n>> Yeah, awesome.\n\n375\n00:18:10.224 --> 00:18:11.305\n[LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely, right.\n\n376\n00:18:11.305 --> 00:18:12.803\nSo, we have to think about all that,\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n377\n00:18:12.803 --> 00:18:15.146\nWe have to analyze,\nexamine the data, right?\n\n378\n00:18:15.146 --> 00:18:17.035\nWe gotta know what's going on there.\n\n379\n00:18:17.035 --> 00:18:19.850\nWe gotta have trained professionals\nthat are gonna do this.\n\n380\n00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.280\nHow do we create a forensically\nsound report of that evidence?\n\n381\n00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.355\nWell, we've gotta detail out what\nwe found under certain conditions.\n\n382\n00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:28.272\nWe gotta think about the audience\nthat we're reporting to.\n\n383\n00:18:28.272 --> 00:18:31.208\nWe've talked about audience reliability\nand audience relevancy before.\n\n384\n00:18:31.208 --> 00:18:34.442\nWe’ve talked about actionable information,\nalternative explanations for\n\n385\n00:18:34.442 --> 00:18:35.520\nwhat we're seeing.\n\n386\n00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.110\nWe gotta think about all this stuff.\n\n387\n00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.070\nWhat about the host\noperating system itself?\n\n388\n00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.440\nRemember, if we're in the cloud and\nwe're virtualizing,\n\n389\n00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.810\nwe've got two operating systems.\n\n390\n00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.720\nWe've got a host and then we have one or\n\n391\n00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.350\nmore guest operating systems that\nare probably running very different OSs.\n\n392\n00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:51.550\nDifferent interpretations of data,\ndifferent configurations,\n\n393\n00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.108\nwe got to deal with both when we deal\nwith forensic examinations in the cloud.\n\n394\n00:18:55.108 --> 00:18:57.310\nSo this is also very important.\n\n395\n00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:01.350\nPhysical access is gonna be required for\nthe host to gather operating system-based\n\n396\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:05.445\ndata, and to do data a gathering,\nas opposed to logical access,\n\n397\n00:19:05.445 --> 00:19:08.990\nremotely gathering information\nfrom the running VM on the host.\n\n398\n00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.180\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n399\n00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.720\nWe need a write blocker as we said,\nto be used to gather this data.\n\n400\n00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.460\nWhat about the guest operating system,\nthe VM access, or\n\n401\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.500\nthe VM operating system\nrunning on top of this?\n\n402\n00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.050\nWe have to think about this as well.\n\n403\n00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:23.360\nSnapshotting may be the best method\nto deal with collecting forensic\n\n404\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.390\nexaminational, or, forensic examinational,\n\n405\n00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.462\nboy I'm just making up English\nwords as we go here left and right.\n\n406\n00:19:29.462 --> 00:19:30.330\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n407\n00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:31.826\n>> Forensically sound information, and\n\n408\n00:19:31.826 --> 00:19:32.360\nto examine it.\n\n409\n00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.545\nSo taking a snapshot, freezing the state\nof that machine at a moment in time,\n\n410\n00:19:36.545 --> 00:19:40.150\ntimestamping it, using a write\nblocker to prevent write back, and\n\n411\n00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:44.870\nthen hashing it, would be the appropriate\nand proper method of capturing\n\n412\n00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.580\na forensically sound image from\na running VM on top of a host.\n\n413\n00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.490\nWe may snapshot it and\nwe may have to use software to do that.\n\n414\n00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:54.960\nSo again, write blockers should\nbe put in place to do that.\n\n415\n00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.860\nWhat about metadata?\n\n416\n00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.650\nScraping all of the data out of a system,\n\n417\n00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:00.130\nwill leave behind the data\nthat describes the data.\n\n418\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.900\nWe have to think about metadata and\nits value as well.\n\n419\n00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.380\nAnd we may wanna understand, or\n\n420\n00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:08.820\nnot may, we should understand that\nmetadata is equally important here, right?\n\n421\n00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.850\nSo we have to understand that\nthe data that describes the data,\n\n422\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.580\nmay have information that may\nbe forensically valuable.\n\n423\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:17.342\nChain of custody as we've talked about,\nvery, very important.\n\n424\n00:20:17.342 --> 00:20:20.190\nWe gotta make sure that we treat\nthe digital evidence identical\n\n425\n00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.410\nto physical evidence,\nwhen it comes to chain of custody.\n\n426\n00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:23.900\nIt should be handled the same way.\n\n427\n00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.420\nWe have to be able to prove that\nthat evidence was secure and\n\n428\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.440\nunder the control of\na particular party at all times.\n\n429\n00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.520\nThis ultimately is probably\nthe most important thing.\n\n430\n00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:36.040\nAnd this is the pivot point that court\ncases get decided on all the time.\n\n431\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.220\nIf we screw up the evidence and screw up\nthe handling and we cannot introduce that\n\n432\n00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.540\nevidence, then it may very well be the\ndifference between guilt and innocence.\n\n433\n00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.040\nNot to harp on this one case by any means,\nbut\n\n434\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.920\nif you think about in the United States,\nmany, many years ago,\n\n435\n00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.010\nyou think about the O.J.\nSimpson trial, right?\n\n436\n00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.770\nWhether you think O.J. Simpson was\nguilty or innocent, irrelevant,\n\n437\n00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:59.250\nnot gonna have that conversation,\ndon't care, not interested in knowing.\n\n438\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.550\nI'm just pointing out that the thing,\nultimately, that led to O.J. Simpson being\n\n439\n00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:07.620\nfound innocent, right, in the criminal\ntrial, but guilty in the civil trial,\n\n440\n00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.670\nwas the fact that the evidence and\nthe chain of custody of that evidence, and\n\n441\n00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.650\nthe handling of it by various parties,\nwas called into question.\n\n442\n00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:19.490\nAnd there was enough reasonable doubt\ncreated in the mind of the jury, and\n\n443\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.095\nin the mind of the judge,\nthat on the criminal side,\n\n444\n00:21:22.095 --> 00:21:26.420\nin the criminal trial about whether he\nactually did or did not commit that act,\n\n445\n00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.990\nthat evidence was not able to be used\nconclusively to find him guilty, right?\n\n446\n00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:32.920\nBut yet\nin the civil trial he was found guilty.\n\n447\n00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.032\nSo it's kind of interesting, right?\n\n448\n00:21:34.032 --> 00:21:36.801\nIn theory he didn't commit a crime, but\nyet he was found that he had to pay for\n\n449\n00:21:36.801 --> 00:21:37.753\na crime he did not commit,\n\n450\n00:21:37.753 --> 00:21:40.457\nwhich is the beautiful thing about\nthe American justice system, right?\n\n451\n00:21:40.457 --> 00:21:44.387\n[LAUGH] So we just wanna understand that,\nbut just know that sometimes this can\n\n452\n00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:48.390\nhappen, and it is not unusual if\nevidence is not handled correctly.\n\n453\n00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:53.175\nA nota bene, nota bene,\nwhich is Latin, n-o-t-a b-e-n-e, or\n\n454\n00:21:53.175 --> 00:21:56.117\nnotabeeny as one of my students once said.\n\n455\n00:21:56.117 --> 00:21:56.625\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n456\n00:21:56.625 --> 00:21:57.489\n>> Right, nota bene,\n\n457\n00:21:57.489 --> 00:22:00.805\nessentially digital evidence has\ntwo parts, the physical medium and\n\n458\n00:22:00.805 --> 00:22:02.755\nthe information itself, right?\n\n459\n00:22:02.755 --> 00:22:07.085\nAnd so we need to understand the concept\nof nota bene, is that the evidence,\n\n460\n00:22:07.085 --> 00:22:11.360\nright, and the information,\nthe physical medium it's contained in and\n\n461\n00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.330\nthe information itself,\nboth make up the evidence.\n\n462\n00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:15.730\nAnd those two parts together,\n\n463\n00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.150\nwe need chain of custody\nassociated with both of them.\n\n464\n00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.510\nSo we wanna understand the concept,\nthat it’s a legal term,\n\n465\n00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:22.510\nand the concept associated with it.\n\n466\n00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.460\nEvidence management is critical.\n\n467\n00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.780\nAnd chain of custody of\nthe evidence is critical for\n\n468\n00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.280\nour ability to be able to\nbe successful in this area.\n\n469\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.890\nWe also need to think a little bit\nabout vendors and partners, and\n\n470\n00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:34.600\nhow we reach out and deal with them.\n\n471\n00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:38.240\nWe've talked about this before,\nmanaging supply chain risk.\n\n472\n00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.903\nAnd understanding how to deal\nwith vendors through federation.\n\n473\n00:22:40.903 --> 00:22:44.072\nAnd contracting with them\nto consume cloud services.\n\n474\n00:22:44.072 --> 00:22:47.519\nAnd we have to also think about the fact\nthat we have to be very up front and\n\n475\n00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:51.483\nvery specific about our needs and our\ndesires in that contractual obligation, or\n\n476\n00:22:51.483 --> 00:22:53.450\nin that contractual agreement rather.\n\n477\n00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.750\nWe have to make sure that we\nunderstand how to use due care and\n\n478\n00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:59.250\ndue diligence to our advantage to get\nwhat we want from our cloud vendors.\n\n479\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.480\nSo we often think about the idea\nof on-boarding of vendors.\n\n480\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.330\nHow do we interact with them and\nget them into our ecosystem?\n\n481\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.250\nHow do we manage them?\n\n482\n00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.382\nHow do we deal with them while\nwe're doing business with them?\n\n483\n00:23:08.382 --> 00:23:09.334\nAnd how do we off board them, right?\n\n484\n00:23:09.334 --> 00:23:13.255\nHow do we do business with them, associate\nwith them, but ultimately over time, exit?\n\n485\n00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:16.135\nAnd we need to have clearly\ndefined exit strategies, and\n\n486\n00:23:16.135 --> 00:23:18.475\nclearly defined onboarding strategies, and\n\n487\n00:23:18.475 --> 00:23:23.100\nclearly defined management strategies at\nall phases of the vendor relationship.\n\n488\n00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.650\nWe also need to remember that\nultimately the guiding principle, and\n\n489\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.160\nthe guiding documentation element here,\nfor the CCSP,\n\n490\n00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.170\nis the SLA,\nthe service level agreement, right?\n\n491\n00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.890\nThat's where all of the expectations and\nstipulations about service will be found.\n\n492\n00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.521\nAnd we need to understand how\nto use that to our advantage.\n\n493\n00:23:37.521 --> 00:23:41.999\nIt must detail out for\nus what the expectations of service are,\n\n494\n00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:45.733\nremember 596979 up time, seconds, right?\n\n495\n00:23:45.733 --> 00:23:46.476\n>> Yeah.\n\n496\n00:23:46.476 --> 00:23:47.544\n>> Tenths, hundredths of seconds, right?\n\n497\n00:23:47.544 --> 00:23:48.763\n>> Microseconds.\n>> Microseconds.\n\n498\n00:23:48.763 --> 00:23:50.870\nWe have to have all that and\nknow that, right?\n\n499\n00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.000\nAnd we have to make sure that we're\nconstantly realigning our expectations,\n\n500\n00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.930\nnot just for ourselves in the business,\nbut also remember,\n\n501\n00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.600\nregulatory compliance concerns\nhave to be represented and\n\n502\n00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.208\nmaintained in the SLA, as do\nstakeholder requirements and concerns.\n\n503\n00:24:04.208 --> 00:24:07.890\nThere's multiple parties that the CCSP,\nin other words, has to play to and\n\n504\n00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.590\nunderstand how to interact with,\nwith regards to this.\n\n505\n00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:14.380\nAnd all of this information, all these\nvarious feeder elements have to be\n\n506\n00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.480\ndistilled down translated, and hopefully\nmanaged against the expectations.\n\n507\n00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.160\nAnd when necessary,\nrealigning the expectations\n\n508\n00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.350\nto meet them is gonna be part\nof our job as CCSPs as well.\n\n509\n00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:25.390\nIt's gonna be very important.\n\n510\n00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.600\n>> Well Adam, this is definitely,\nas far as I'm concerned,\n\n511\n00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.220\nwe saved the best for last.\n\n512\n00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.334\nOne of the coolest things to talk about\nis what happens if something actually\n\n513\n00:24:33.334 --> 00:24:34.696\nhappens, what do we do?\n\n514\n00:24:34.696 --> 00:24:35.915\nAnd this is what it's all about, right?\n\n515\n00:24:35.915 --> 00:24:40.632\nThe forensic evidence, gathering that\nstuff up, examining it, making sure\n\n516\n00:24:40.632 --> 00:24:45.134\nthat its integrity is maintained, and\nthen ultimately being used to maybe\n\n517\n00:24:45.134 --> 00:24:50.080\nuncover the culpable parties, or just\nfiguring out what the heck went wrong.\n\n518\n00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.050\nThat just might be the thing of it,\nyou never know.\n\n519\n00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:54.310\nIt may just look like a breach, but\n\n520\n00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.610\nit was really that Adam spilled\nan espresso on the server.\n\n521\n00:24:57.610 --> 00:24:58.910\nAnd blew it up accidentally.\n\n522\n00:24:58.910 --> 00:24:59.675\n>> I'm just covering.\n\n523\n00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:01.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm just lying outright,\n\n524\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:02.890\nI'm just not saying that I did it.\n\n525\n00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:03.510\nI'm-\n>> Exactly.\n\n526\n00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.230\n>> Culpable for nothing.\n\n527\n00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.780\n>> That's right.\n\n528\n00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.860\n>> I'm culpable for nothing.\n\n529\n00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:10.385\n>> But definitely, I would say\nthe sexiest part of being in security,\n\n530\n00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:15.095\nis being a part of the forensic\ngathering and examination portion.\n\n531\n00:25:15.095 --> 00:25:15.860\n>> It is a cool part.\n\n532\n00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.800\n>> Very cool stuff.\n\n533\n00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.120\n>> It is a cool part, no doubt about it.\n\n534\n00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.410\n>> Adam, we have trudged a long and\narduous journey, but\n\n535\n00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.680\nit looks like we have come to the end.\n\n536\n00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.120\nI do thank you so much, Sir.\n\n537\n00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.670\n>> You're welcome.\n\n538\n00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.745\n>> Your kung fu is strong.\n\n539\n00:25:26.745 --> 00:25:28.820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And hopefully ours will be stronger for\n\n540\n00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.180\nhaving been around it.\n\n541\n00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:33.040\nThat being said,\nwe are signing off for ITPro.TV.\n\n542\n00:25:33.040

ITProTV.\n\n3\n00:00:16.151 --> 00:00:17.900\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n4\n00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.761\nAnd in today's episode,\n\n5\n00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:22.740\nwe are continuing with our certified\ncloud security professional series.\n\n6\n00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.540\nJoining us back in the studio again today\nto help us out with that very endeavor,\n\n7\n00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.610\nour good friend and\nmentor, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.100\nAdam, welcome back to the show,\nhow's it going, sir?\n\n9\n00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.004\n>> Good, good, how come I always\nhave to join you in the studio?\n\n10\n00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:35.164\nWhen it's a nice day,\nI don't get to join you at the beach?\n\n11\n00:00:35.164 --> 00:00:37.114\nI don't get to join you at a restaurant?\n\n12\n00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:39.400\n>> We'll talk to Don about an onsite.\n\n13\n00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.692\n>> I get to only join you in\nthe studio where we have wide\n\n14\n00:00:42.692 --> 00:00:47.620\ntemperature fluctuations and we have\nall sorts of other things that go on.\n\n15\n00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.090\nSo I'm thinking that it may be important\nfor us to go on location at some point.\n\n16\n00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.860\nThat's all I'm suggesting.\n\n17\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.550\n>> I'll second that.\n\n18\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.120\n>> I hear the Caribbean's very\nlovely this time of year.\n\n19\n00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.990\nSo anyway, I'm doing very well,\nthank you for asking.\n\n20\n00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.300\nSo we want to continue our\nconversation as we always do\n\n21\n00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.830\nwhen we are talking about\nthings with the cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.740\nThere's always things to expand,\nexpose, and expound upon.\n\n23\n00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.590\nSo we will be doing that.\n\n24\n00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.120\nAnd we're gonna focus in this episode and\nsome of our discussions upcoming for\n\n25\n00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.800\nthe continuation of these topic broadly,\naround legal compliance.\n\n26\n00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.290\nWhat it means to be\ncompliant in the cloud.\n\n27\n00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.230\nWhat are the legal ramifications,\nthe concerns, the risks?\n\n28\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.890\nAnd the things that we as CCSP's\nhave to not only be aware of,but\n\n29\n00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880\nthat advise our business about with\nregards to cloud, cloud compliance, and\n\n30\n00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.070\nof course, risk management.\n\n31\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.280\nUnderstanding legal requirements\nunique risks within the cloud,\n\n32\n00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.980\nis going to be very important for us.\n\n33\n00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.040\nIt's hard sometimes, right, to really\nunderstand what it is that we need to do\n\n34\n00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.540\nto be on the right side\nof that conversation.\n\n35\n00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.536\nAre we compliant, are we being observant\nof all the laws, all the regulations,\n\n36\n00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:47.487\nall the concerns that we\nmay have to be aware of?\n\n37\n00:01:47.487 --> 00:01:50.053\nWhen we think about, for instance,\njust outside of the cloud,\n\n38\n00:01:50.053 --> 00:01:52.677\ngenerically driving down the street\noperating a motor vehicle.\n\n39\n00:01:52.677 --> 00:01:56.632\nThere are so many, if you stop and think,\nactually, regardless of where you live in\n\n40\n00:01:56.632 --> 00:01:59.974\nthe world and where you drive,\nin most countries, not in all but in most\n\n41\n00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:04.740\ncountries there are many, many laws that\ngovern the use of a motor vehicle, right?\n\n42\n00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.360\nSo for instance, universally\ntypically when you see a stop sign or\n\n43\n00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.780\nsomebody with a gun holding the gun\nat you or a red flag or something,\n\n44\n00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.140\na red light whatever, some indication\nof stop, you know that as an authorized\n\n45\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.040\nowner and manager, and ultimately user of\nthat car, you're supposed to stop, right?\n\n46\n00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.540\nIn theory anyway,\nthat's what the indication is.\n\n47\n00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.750\nWhen we see that there may be\nan obstruction in the road, right, we\n\n48\n00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.860\nknow that we should slow down, we should\nnot just barrel and speed through that,\n\n49\n00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.820\nat least not unless you're filming a movie\nof some kind anyway, normally, right?\n\n50\n00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.420\nSo we know that there are these kind\nof things that we have to think about,\n\n51\n00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.450\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n52\n00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.190\nThere's common sense,\nin other words, right,\n\n53\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.170\nthat goes along with a lot\nof the things we do.\n\n54\n00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.510\nWe know that when we see an obstruction,\nwe should slow down.\n\n55\n00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.000\nWe know that when we see some sort of an\nissue or a concern that we should stop and\n\n56\n00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.060\nreally pay attention.\n\n57\n00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.620\nWe know that, at least in theory anyway,\n\n58\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.740\nwe should under normal driving conditions\nobserve the speed limit, right?\n\n59\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.720\nThere may be exceptions to that,\nbut by law,\n\n60\n00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.880\nwe're supposed to observe the speed\nlimit more often than not.\n\n61\n00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.510\nWe know that we may or may not be able\nto make a right turn on red, right?\n\n62\n00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.380\nSometimes you may, sometimes you may not.\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.920\nIt depends on where you come from and\nobviously what the laws and the rules are.\n\n64\n00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.980\nBut this is an interesting aside, right?\n\n65\n00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.950\nWith regards to the right on red,\nat least in the United States anyway,\n\n66\n00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.835\nand specifically in the southern\nportion of the United States.\n\n67\n00:03:19.835 --> 00:03:23.875\nIn the south, you are for the most\npart allowed to make a right on red.\n\n68\n00:03:23.875 --> 00:03:26.955\nYou do have to stop first, right, but\nyou are allowed to make a right on red.\n\n69\n00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:29.555\nPeople often miss that part and\ngo right on through the red.\n\n70\n00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:32.685\nBut you are supposed to stop and then in\ntheory, if there's no traffic coming and\n\n71\n00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:37.195\nyou're on a certain kind of thoroughfare\nroadway where there is no issue and\n\n72\n00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:39.415\nconcern with you turning into, right,\n\n73\n00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:41.985\nthe road to make a right turn,\nthen you are allowed to.\n\n74\n00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.520\nIf you have to turn across\nincoming traffic, right,\n\n75\n00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.150\ngoing across like maybe a divided highway,\nmaybe it's not such a good idea, right,\n\n76\n00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.970\nyou have to wait on the light.\n\n77\n00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.083\nBut if you're turning onto a road that\nessentially is a one way direction flow\n\n78\n00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:55.487\ngoing away from you to\nthe right-hand side,\n\n79\n00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:58.098\nyou're allowed to make\na right hand turn on red.\n\n80\n00:03:58.098 --> 00:04:00.836\nBut in certain parts of the United States,\nin certain states,\n\n81\n00:04:00.836 --> 00:04:02.296\nyou're not allowed to, right?\n\n82\n00:04:02.296 --> 00:04:05.158\nAnd as a result of that,\npeople, when they travel around,\n\n83\n00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:07.700\nare not always aware of\nthe differences in law.\n\n84\n00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.530\nYou may have been behind one or\nmore of these people.\n\n85\n00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.920\nI certainly have, right,\n\n86\n00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.050\nwhere we tend to find them,\nsitting at a red light, not moving, right?\n\n87\n00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.680\nThey don't understand they\ncan make a right on red.\n\n88\n00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.980\nDepending on where you live,\nin other words, right?\n\n89\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.430\nYou may not realize that it is\nallowable here and not allowable there.\n\n90\n00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.851\nEven though we have signs up that\nsay it's okay to turn right on red.\n\n91\n00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:27.359\n>> I had a lady emphatically\ntell me I cannot do that.\n\n92\n00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:28.729\nI said, yes, you can.\n\n93\n00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.836\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, so it brings up an interesting\n\n94\n00:04:31.836 --> 00:04:36.077\nobservation that I wanna share as\nthe beginning of our conversation with\n\n95\n00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:40.892\nregards to legal compliance and management\nof concerns around that in the cloud.\n\n96\n00:04:40.892 --> 00:04:43.999\nBecause when we have clearly\ndistinct borders, geographies,\n\n97\n00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.415\nrules that apply that\nare gonna be situational but\n\n98\n00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:50.269\nwe understand the boundaries and the\nborders of that situational reference for\n\n99\n00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:53.833\nthe rule, it is easier to have\nthe conversation about yes, you can, no,\n\n100\n00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:57.426\nyou can't, yes, you should, no,\nyou shouldn't, I will, I won't.\n\n101\n00:04:57.426 --> 00:05:00.975\nWhen we are in an environment where\nborders as we've defined the cloud,\n\n102\n00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:03.942\nfrom the very first conversations,\nin our first episodes,\n\n103\n00:05:03.942 --> 00:05:08.340\nas we've begun to discussing CCSP and\nall throughout all of our time together.\n\n104\n00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.360\nAs we've been discussing it,\n\n105\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.710\nhave really made clear that the cloud\ndoes not always have borders.\n\n106\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.160\nIn fact, in many respects,\nit is borderless.\n\n107\n00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.130\nAnd as a result of that, it may be very\ndifficult for us to talk about the idea\n\n108\n00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.480\nof this rule or this concerned or\nthis operational construct in this way\n\n109\n00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.168\nof doing things being applicable here but\nmaybe not being applicable there.\n\n110\n00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:31.223\nBecause it becomes very difficult\nto differentiate where are those\n\n111\n00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:34.394\nborders are and as a result,\nwhat the lines of responsibility may be.\n\n112\n00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:37.998\nAnd it's not always that way but I'm just\npointing out to you that it may become\n\n113\n00:05:37.998 --> 00:05:40.301\nmore difficult,\nit maybe harder to understand.\n\n114\n00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:43.874\nAnd as a result of that,\nit may be less obvious, right, for\n\n115\n00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:47.733\nus as cloud security professionals and\nfor our customers and for\n\n116\n00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:51.860\nthe cloud providers to come to\nan agreement on what that means.\n\n117\n00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.750\nWhen we all live in a place where right\nturns on red are expected and the norm.\n\n118\n00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.971\nYou grow up learning from the time you\nstart driving, that's what you do.\n\n119\n00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.530\nSo everybody does it that way.\n\n120\n00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.178\nWhen you come from a place where you\ndon't do that, you don't know that that's\n\n121\n00:06:04.178 --> 00:06:08.044\nacceptable and of course then you may well\nmay not be prepared to you're comfortable\n\n122\n00:06:08.044 --> 00:06:11.158\nand or feel it's the right thing to\ndo in order to make a right on red.\n\n123\n00:06:11.158 --> 00:06:13.549\nYou grew up in other words\nthinking you're breaking the law.\n\n124\n00:06:13.549 --> 00:06:18.306\nAnd both points of view are 100%\naccurate by the way given the contextual\n\n125\n00:06:18.306 --> 00:06:21.460\nsituational reference\nthat that person has.\n\n126\n00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.449\nIn the cloud, that contextual situational\nreference may not be clear and\n\n127\n00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:26.993\nboth parties may be right but\n\n128\n00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:30.354\nboth parties may also be wrong\ndepending on the point of view.\n\n129\n00:06:30.354 --> 00:06:34.330\nThe context and the point at which we\nare having the discussion based on where\n\n130\n00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.566\nthe information is versus the geography or\n\n131\n00:06:36.566 --> 00:06:40.371\nthe jurisdiction that we are thinking\nthat information may be ruled by.\n\n132\n00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:44.221\nWe talked in one of our prior episodes\nabout jurisdictional and applicable laws\n\n133\n00:06:44.221 --> 00:06:48.081\nand the concerns about the applicable\nlaw versus the jurisdiction you're in.\n\n134\n00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:49.335\nAnd whether the state or\n\n135\n00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:53.727\nthe third party actor has a right to claim\njurisdiction over the information versus\n\n136\n00:06:53.727 --> 00:06:58.130\nthe applicable laws that will be applied\nwhen jurisdiction is established.\n\n137\n00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.900\nSo we have to understand that\nthere's a lot of moving parts here\n\n138\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.810\nas we talk about compliance and\nwe begin our conversation.\n\n139\n00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.495\nInternational legislations and\ninternational legislative concerns and\n\n140\n00:07:08.495 --> 00:07:12.588\nconflicts are cropping up all\nthe time with regards to the cloud.\n\n141\n00:07:12.588 --> 00:07:16.785\nWe think about the fact,\nover the last, let's say year,\n\n142\n00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:21.585\napproximately, certainly in\nthe end of 2015 into 2016,\n\n143\n00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:25.114\nwe saw there was a very,\nvery big kind of to-do.\n\n144\n00:07:25.114 --> 00:07:27.871\nThat is a formal term,\ncloud security term, to-do.\n\n145\n00:07:27.871 --> 00:07:30.280\nYou can only be a CSSP and use that term.\n\n146\n00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.950\nIf you're not certified, don't say to-do\ncuz it is a actual certified word.\n\n147\n00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.020\nI am kidding of course.\n\n148\n00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:35.570\nI am kidding.\n\n149\n00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.739\nIt's Thursday, laugh, fun.\n\n150\n00:07:37.739 --> 00:07:38.505\n>> Where's the laugh track?\n\n151\n00:07:38.505 --> 00:07:40.600\n[LAUGH]\n>> [CROSSTALK] Smile,\n\n152\n00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.866\ncan you do that really crazy smile for\nus again?\n\n153\n00:07:43.866 --> 00:07:45.099\nMy God.\nYeah, that thing, right, okay.\n\n154\n00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:47.212\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't look like that when you laugh.\n\n155\n00:07:47.212 --> 00:07:48.485\n[LAUGH] That would be bad.\n\n156\n00:07:48.485 --> 00:07:52.373\nSo, when we think about\ninternational legislative concerns,\n\n157\n00:07:52.373 --> 00:07:54.822\nin the end of 2015, into 2016.\n\n158\n00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:57.892\n>> We actually saw between\nthe United States and\n\n159\n00:07:57.892 --> 00:08:00.245\nthe EU a major issue that erupted.\n\n160\n00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:03.064\nAnd ultimately,\ncame to a head through the EU courts in,\n\n161\n00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:07.004\nI think late October November of 2015\nwith regards to something we'll talk\n\n162\n00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:09.089\nabout in a little bit called safe harbor.\n\n163\n00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:12.304\nAnd the safe harbor thought\nprocess around whether or\n\n164\n00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:16.806\nnot, we can actually have a regulatory\nregime that gives us an exception to\n\n165\n00:08:16.806 --> 00:08:20.394\nthe EU 95/46 Data Privacy and\nProtection Directive.\n\n166\n00:08:20.394 --> 00:08:24.154\nSo that is a business maintaining\ndata on an EU citizen,\n\n167\n00:08:24.154 --> 00:08:29.354\nwe don't have to comply with the actual\nletter of the 95/46 directive,\n\n168\n00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:33.914\nbut rather we can comply with the spirit\nof that and reach some sort of\n\n169\n00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:38.648\nan accommodation as a negotiated\nagreement that allows us to do that.\n\n170\n00:08:38.648 --> 00:08:40.584\nBecause the laws in the North America,\n\n171\n00:08:40.584 --> 00:08:44.047\nspecifically in the United States\nwith regards to data protection and\n\n172\n00:08:44.047 --> 00:08:47.816\nprivacy are not as strong at least at this\nmoment in time as they are in the EU.\n\n173\n00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:52.490\nAnd so, this battle that going on for\nyears back in forth came to a head.\n\n174\n00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.012\nPeople had sued in the EU courts.\n\n175\n00:08:54.012 --> 00:08:57.499\nAnd ultimately, it was found according\nto the court that the safe harbor\n\n176\n00:08:57.499 --> 00:09:01.328\nnegotiation, the safe harbor clause\nthe United States had signed with the EU,\n\n177\n00:09:01.328 --> 00:09:02.780\nessentially was nullified.\n\n178\n00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.553\nThey threw it out.\n\n179\n00:09:03.553 --> 00:09:06.351\nThe courts said, sorry,\nyou can't have an exception,\n\n180\n00:09:06.351 --> 00:09:09.329\nbecause you're not operating\nunder the proper guidance and\n\n181\n00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:12.736\nthe adherence to the rule and\nyou're essentially breaking the law.\n\n182\n00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:14.156\nSo, we're not gonna allow this to occur.\n\n183\n00:09:14.156 --> 00:09:19.674\nSo after late October, early November of\n2015, Safe Harbor was essentially dead.\n\n184\n00:09:19.674 --> 00:09:23.517\nAnd there was window where\nthe court gave the two parties,\n\n185\n00:09:23.517 --> 00:09:27.676\nthe United States and the EU\nthe ability to negotiate a change or\n\n186\n00:09:27.676 --> 00:09:30.674\nsome sort of a separation\nthat would change.\n\n187\n00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:33.362\nAnd therefore,\nadjust what was safe harbor.\n\n188\n00:09:33.362 --> 00:09:35.434\nThey were given till early February.\n\n189\n00:09:35.434 --> 00:09:38.278\nI think February 3rd of 2016,\nif I remember correctly.\n\n190\n00:09:38.278 --> 00:09:41.626\nAnd on February 2nd, they announced\nwithin 24 hours of the deadline,\n\n191\n00:09:41.626 --> 00:09:44.164\nthey announced they'd\nfinally reached an agreement,\n\n192\n00:09:44.164 --> 00:09:46.597\nwhich is now being referred\nto as the privacy shield.\n\n193\n00:09:46.597 --> 00:09:50.239\nThe problem is that since then and\nthrough the implementation,\n\n194\n00:09:50.239 --> 00:09:53.553\na timeline that was laid out\nto implement privacy shield.\n\n195\n00:09:53.553 --> 00:09:58.454\nThey being the two parties have no reached\nan exactly agreement on whether or\n\n196\n00:09:58.454 --> 00:10:01.914\nnot that is going to exactly\ndo what they need it to do.\n\n197\n00:10:01.914 --> 00:10:05.108\nThey kinda rush to negotiate something,\nsaid something.\n\n198\n00:10:05.108 --> 00:10:07.507\nWe have to put something in place,\nsomething is better than nothing.\n\n199\n00:10:07.507 --> 00:10:10.307\nSo we have this, but now they're\nbacking away from that a little bit.\n\n200\n00:10:10.307 --> 00:10:12.824\nAnd the EU is saying,\nmaybe not as good as we thought.\n\n201\n00:10:12.824 --> 00:10:14.208\nMaybe we're not happy with that.\n\n202\n00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:15.708\nMaybe that's not going to be enough and\n\n203\n00:10:15.708 --> 00:10:18.082\nwe're waiting to see what will\nultimately happen with that.\n\n204\n00:10:18.082 --> 00:10:22.502\nSo there is international legislative\nconflicts that do occur around privacy,\n\n205\n00:10:22.502 --> 00:10:26.467\naround the protection of data,\naround the understanding of the data and\n\n206\n00:10:26.467 --> 00:10:28.223\nwhere it is going to be managed.\n\n207\n00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:29.850\nWho owns it, who has rights to it.\n\n208\n00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.815\nWhat we can do with it under treaty,\n\n209\n00:10:31.815 --> 00:10:35.493\nunder legislative control help\nsomebody through jurisdiction.\n\n210\n00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:36.550\nSo, it is very important.\n\n211\n00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.758\nCloud computing introduces these concerns\nto us in a new and innovative and really.\n\n212\n00:10:40.758 --> 00:10:45.102\nProblematic way for some parties,\nbecause removing data across geographic\n\n213\n00:10:45.102 --> 00:10:48.395\nboundaries, what we would\nnormally think of as borders.\n\n214\n00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:51.647\nBut we're not using border controls,\nas I talked about in a prior episode.\n\n215\n00:10:51.647 --> 00:10:55.200\nWe're not showing up at the checkpoint\nwhere we have to show our passport and\n\n216\n00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.324\nasking permission in order to\nessentially move into the country.\n\n217\n00:10:58.324 --> 00:11:04.124\nWe're just throwing bits on the wire and\non a cable, it's buried under the sea,\n\n218\n00:11:04.124 --> 00:11:08.919\n20 feet down in the ground running\nacross a national state area.\n\n219\n00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:12.515\nBoy, I am just having all sorts\nof problems speaking in my native\n\n220\n00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:13.388\ntongue today.\n\n221\n00:11:13.388 --> 00:11:16.780\nI'm gonna have to think about that and\nsee if we can do something about that.\n\n222\n00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:22.064\n>> I brings up something I learned as\na young man driving through country.\n\n223\n00:11:22.064 --> 00:11:23.564\nYes, how to speak clearly and\n\n224\n00:11:23.564 --> 00:11:26.754\nthe fact that there are times like\neven in the United States we.\n\n225\n00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:30.052\nWe have states correct they have\ntheir boundaries, their boarders, but\n\n226\n00:11:30.052 --> 00:11:31.657\nthere's no check points to cross.\n\n227\n00:11:31.657 --> 00:11:34.330\nIf I wanted to go from Florida to Georgia,\nI would just drive.\n\n228\n00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:38.402\nAnd at some point, I would enter Georgian\nland and then if I kept going I'd be in\n\n229\n00:11:38.402 --> 00:11:41.191\nSouth Carolina North Carolina and\nso on and so forth.\n\n230\n00:11:41.191 --> 00:11:44.711\nIf you get into Virginia, I believe it is.\n\n231\n00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:49.444\nThey don't allow radar detectors and\nthey will confiscate, and\n\n232\n00:11:49.444 --> 00:11:54.191\ndestroy any radar detector found\nin the DC area or Virginia area.\n\n233\n00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:57.127\nNow I didn't have to pass\nthrough a check point, but\n\n234\n00:11:57.127 --> 00:11:59.746\nthe law changed as I'm\njust passing through.\n\n235\n00:11:59.746 --> 00:12:02.969\nKind of the same idea of using cloud and\nworking data and\n\n236\n00:12:02.969 --> 00:12:05.294\nit's crossing all these boundaries.\n\n237\n00:12:05.294 --> 00:12:07.283\nIt's never having to be\nchecked as it enters and\n\n238\n00:12:07.283 --> 00:12:09.282\ngo well,\nnow do you comply with our standards.\n\n239\n00:12:09.282 --> 00:12:12.988\nAnd before you go through here and do we\nneed to reroute you around another way,\n\n240\n00:12:12.988 --> 00:12:16.773\nbecause maybe you're not following some\nregulation that we've put in place.\n\n241\n00:12:16.773 --> 00:12:18.335\nThey just allow you to go through.\n\n242\n00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:20.696\nBut if they catch you in that spot and\n\n243\n00:12:20.696 --> 00:12:26.066\nyou're doing something they don't agree\nwith, you are kind of at their mercy.\n\n244\n00:12:26.066 --> 00:12:28.420\n>> Yes, it's a very good point.\n\n245\n00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.346\nIt's very astute observation you make and\nit is absolutely true.\n\n246\n00:12:31.346 --> 00:12:33.942\nThere are many variances.\n\n247\n00:12:33.942 --> 00:12:39.187\nMany, many variables that are involved\nwith this kind of a conversation.\n\n248\n00:12:39.187 --> 00:12:42.982\nWe're trying to essentially use\na globalized technology in a localized\n\n249\n00:12:42.982 --> 00:12:46.899\nenvironment and then we don't really\nhave a way of globalizing the laws and\n\n250\n00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:51.194\nthe applicable regulatory frameworks\nto that technology, because there isn't\n\n251\n00:12:51.194 --> 00:12:54.951\nagreement globally among all the players\nand through all the parties.\n\n252\n00:12:54.951 --> 00:12:55.745\nAll the countries,\n\n253\n00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:58.603\nall the businesses, all the individual\ncustomers and everybody else.\n\n254\n00:12:58.603 --> 00:13:02.630\nThere's not an overarching agreement\nabout how we should do this.\n\n255\n00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:07.121\nSo one country may say, well, we have the\nright to be able to see everything that's\n\n256\n00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:10.349\nbeen encrypted and\ndata that's encrypted in our country.\n\n257\n00:13:10.349 --> 00:13:12.343\nAnd so we want our recovery key,\nessentially.\n\n258\n00:13:12.343 --> 00:13:16.007\nThis is what the United States\ngovernment attempted to negotiate,\n\n259\n00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:20.326\nspecifically with the FBI and the Apple\ncase that took place early in 2016.\n\n260\n00:13:20.326 --> 00:13:25.020\nWhere they wanted access and essentially,\nwanted Apple to give them backdoor access\n\n261\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.190\nby breaking the encryption on the suspect\niPhone that was gonna be owned by or\n\n262\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.098\nhappened to be owned by one of the people\nthat was involved in one of those\n\n263\n00:13:33.098 --> 00:13:34.885\nattacks out in San Bernardino.\n\n264\n00:13:34.885 --> 00:13:39.205\nAnd as a result of that, the government\nmost essentially trying to say, hey,\n\n265\n00:13:39.205 --> 00:13:42.086\nwe want to be able to open\nup encrypted data whether or\n\n266\n00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:45.758\nnot we normally have the right to\nsee it under certain conditions.\n\n267\n00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:49.646\nWhether we agree with that or not, whether\nwe feel that's a good thing, a bad thing,\n\n268\n00:13:49.646 --> 00:13:52.512\nyou're neutral on it,\nreally not important, not relevant.\n\n269\n00:13:52.512 --> 00:13:54.701\nWe're not having that conversation,\n\n270\n00:13:54.701 --> 00:13:59.145\nwe're just pointing out that they are\ntrying to apply a different standard than\n\n271\n00:13:59.145 --> 00:14:02.153\nwhat the law currently says\nthey should be able to do.\n\n272\n00:14:02.153 --> 00:14:06.439\nAnd they were trying to negotiate or use\nthe courts to ultimately compel one party\n\n273\n00:14:06.439 --> 00:14:10.598\nto behave a certain way, given the law or\neven the interpretation of the law and\n\n274\n00:14:10.598 --> 00:14:13.454\nwhat it said you could or\nshould not, or would not do.\n\n275\n00:14:13.454 --> 00:14:16.495\nThat ultimately resolved itself and\nthe case didn't go forward.\n\n276\n00:14:16.495 --> 00:14:19.772\nSomebody was able to figure out a way\nto do that on behalf of the government\n\n277\n00:14:19.772 --> 00:14:22.783\nwithout Apple compelling that\nare being compelled to do that, but\n\n278\n00:14:22.783 --> 00:14:25.603\nthat brings up some very\ninteresting questions in this area.\n\n279\n00:14:25.603 --> 00:14:29.632\nAre we able to reach consensus in\nagreement on what is acceptable?\n\n280\n00:14:29.632 --> 00:14:32.512\nYou may not, for instance, in certain\ncountries be able to use certain\n\n281\n00:14:32.512 --> 00:14:35.304\nencryption algorithm,\nbecause the government doesn't allow it.\n\n282\n00:14:35.304 --> 00:14:38.802\nBecause they are worried about the fact\nthat they can't break the encryption and\n\n283\n00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:40.613\nread communications, and look at data.\n\n284\n00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:44.471\nAnd they make that perfectly clear, but\nthe idea is that if you wanna do business\n\n285\n00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:48.157\nthere, you have to understand that\nthe protection you maybe afford in other\n\n286\n00:14:48.157 --> 00:14:50.823\ncountries may not be available\nto you in that country.\n\n287\n00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:54.080\nMany, many countries in many\nareas of the world without naming\n\n288\n00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.222\nany specific countries have issues and\nconcerns with this.\n\n289\n00:14:57.222 --> 00:15:01.898\nAnd I've said, if you want our businesses\nand you want our people to come and\n\n290\n00:15:01.898 --> 00:15:04.908\ndo business there,\nthat may not be acceptable.\n\n291\n00:15:04.908 --> 00:15:07.016\nAnd the country in question has said,\nwell, guess what?\n\n292\n00:15:07.016 --> 00:15:08.597\nDo it our way or just don't come.\n\n293\n00:15:08.597 --> 00:15:10.180\nWe're not interested, we don't care.\n\n294\n00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.462\nIt's our country,\nour border, our geography.\n\n295\n00:15:12.462 --> 00:15:13.603\nWe can decide.\n\n296\n00:15:13.603 --> 00:15:16.162\nSo, this is an ongoing conversation.\n\n297\n00:15:16.162 --> 00:15:17.812\nAnd as cloud professionals,\n\n298\n00:15:17.812 --> 00:15:21.376\nwe have to understand as CCSPs\nthat we may not be doing business,\n\n299\n00:15:21.376 --> 00:15:25.874\nour business is may not be doing business\nin these geographies, in these areas.\n\n300\n00:15:25.874 --> 00:15:29.744\nYou may have nothing to do with\ncountry X or country Y, or country W.\n\n301\n00:15:29.744 --> 00:15:33.104\nAnd you business may never set food\nthere and it may not sell there or\n\n302\n00:15:33.104 --> 00:15:33.947\nbuy from there.\n\n303\n00:15:33.947 --> 00:15:37.363\nSo, you may not care about\nwhat they say and that's fine.\n\n304\n00:15:37.363 --> 00:15:40.635\nBut if your data ends up going\nthrough there at some point with or\n\n305\n00:15:40.635 --> 00:15:44.911\nwithout your knowledge, you better be\naware of what the issues and concerns are.\n\n306\n00:15:44.911 --> 00:15:48.418\nAnd you better have knowledge of that,\nbecause if that the data does wind\n\n307\n00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:52.501\nup there either on purpose or by accident,\nyou may actually be faced with a situation\n\n308\n00:15:52.501 --> 00:15:55.547\nwhere you may now have to comply\nunder a different set of laws and\n\n309\n00:15:55.547 --> 00:15:58.104\nif your business is not\ndoing business there today.\n\n310\n00:15:58.104 --> 00:16:02.394\nBut at some point in the future you decide\nto, you have to be prepared to advise\n\n311\n00:16:02.394 --> 00:16:06.223\nthe business on what the legal\nramifications of the impacts will be,\n\n312\n00:16:06.223 --> 00:16:08.863\nof having to turn over\nmaster encryption keys or\n\n313\n00:16:08.863 --> 00:16:13.087\nproviding a back door into your data in\norder to ensure that the government or\n\n314\n00:16:13.087 --> 00:16:17.047\nwhatever the entity is that represents\nthat interest has the access and\n\n315\n00:16:17.047 --> 00:16:20.120\nthe ability to read that\ndata if they require it.\n\n316\n00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.620\nSo that's something to consider,\n\n317\n00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.370\nbecause we may decide we don't\nwanna do business there.\n\n318\n00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.500\nSo a good example of this is\nthe fact that there's this ongoing\n\n319\n00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.430\nraging debate about whether businesses\nwanna be in China or not because of\n\n320\n00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:36.780\nthe economic development opportunities but\nalso because clearly Chinese government.\n\n321\n00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.930\nThe Chinese government currently,\n\n322\n00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:41.100\nand prior governments, this may not\nhappen in the future, we don't know,\n\n323\n00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.990\nbut at least up to the current day as\nwe're filming this and talking to you,\n\n324\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.430\nthe current Chinese government has made it\nclear that business' that want to be there\n\n325\n00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.600\nhave to follow certain laws with\nregards to access to information.\n\n326\n00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.690\nThey may or may not be able to\nfreely advertise the information and\n\n327\n00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.400\nuse the internet the same way they\nwould in the United States or\n\n328\n00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.670\noutside of China in other areas.\n\n329\n00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.930\nAnd if businesses aren't\nwilling to do that,\n\n330\n00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.470\nthen they may not be welcome in China,\nbecause Chinese law stipulates that,\n\n331\n00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.390\nessentially, this control is in\nthe hands of the government, right?\n\n332\n00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.970\nAnd the government has the right to\ndecide, how these particular items will be\n\n333\n00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.830\ndealt with, what they will talk about,\nwhat they will report on, what they will\n\n334\n00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:21.512\nallow to be discussed, what kind of\ninformation they will allow to be traded.\n\n335\n00:17:21.512 --> 00:17:23.450\nAnd if companies are comfortable\nwith that no problem.\n\n336\n00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.060\nIf they are not,\nthe can chose to do business else where.\n\n337\n00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.200\nAnd the government doesn't make secrets so\nthat they don't, your trade are high,\n\n338\n00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.910\nthat is a a very upfront\nabout that which is good or\n\n339\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.740\nwe may not agree with that policy,\nwe may not agree with that approach.\n\n340\n00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.250\nBut it's good that the government at least\ntells us what the expectations are so\n\n341\n00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:40.900\nwe can decide whether or\nnot as security professional's\n\n342\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.050\nwe're going to be willing to and indeed\nbe able to live up to those expectations.\n\n343\n00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.180\nSo we have to understand that things\nlike copyright and privacy laws, very,\n\n344\n00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.520\nvery important to understand.\n\n345\n00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.820\nHow we are protecting\nintellectual property.\n\n346\n00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.810\nThe information that is distilled down\nfrom the creation of something is that\n\n347\n00:17:55.810 --> 00:18:00.230\nusable or do we have to have\nrights to do so how we have that\n\n348\n00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:04.100\nconversation what that means both in the\ncloud and outside the cloud, is actually\n\n349\n00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.470\nfairly clear today copyright and\npiracy laws are pretty well established.\n\n350\n00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.440\nIntellectual property protections have\nbeen around for in many cases over 100\n\n351\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.290\nyears around the world through the world\nintellectual property organization and\n\n352\n00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.420\nthrough various entities like that through\nthe registration of trade patents and\n\n353\n00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.350\ntrade marks and copy rights and things\nof that nature this is a fairly well\n\n354\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.230\nestablished area of law prior to\nthe advent of the digital revolution.\n\n355\n00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.530\nPrior to the advent of the Cloud.\n\n356\n00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:35.220\nAnd this is something that has been\ncarried over pretty much consistently.\n\n357\n00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.870\nAnd with out exception into the Cloud.\n\n358\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.170\nAnd has been extended, in a sense,\nand we've modified the definition\n\n359\n00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:45.170\nof what certain works are and\nhow they are protected.\n\n360\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.340\nTo align them with the current\nconventions in the copyright law,\n\n361\n00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.780\nand the trade mark law,\nand the patent law.\n\n362\n00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.880\nBut other than that, to broaden\nthe definition to incorporate software and\n\n363\n00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.000\ndigital works,\nwe essentially apply the same protection.\n\n364\n00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.300\nA copyright's a copyright, right,\n\n365\n00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:01.680\na trademark's a trademark,\na patent's a patent.\n\n366\n00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.560\nAs long as you are meeting\nthe obligations to validate that you're\n\n367\n00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.830\ncreating something new and novel,\nyou can be granted that protection and\n\n368\n00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.010\nyou can then be afforded the remuneration.\n\n369\n00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.480\nPeople will pay you to use that invention.\n\n370\n00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:14.410\nUnder that guidance, and\nthat's available, pretty much,\n\n371\n00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.840\nworldwide, with very few exceptions.\n\n372\n00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.170\nThe exceptions being countries that\njust don't, are not signatories, or\n\n373\n00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.790\ndon't align with that or\nfor whatever reason,\n\n374\n00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:25.460\ndon't recognize that protection, whoever\nthey may be, whatever those reasons are.\n\n375\n00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.410\nThe bulk of the countries in the world\nrecognize those protections and\n\n376\n00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:29.890\nenforce them, by the way.\n\n377\n00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.440\nAnd do so across the board,\nwithout exception.\n\n378\n00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.920\nThings like Directive 95/46 from the EU,\nwhich is the Data Protection and\n\n379\n00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.590\nPrivacy Directive and we'll take\na look at that in a little bit and\n\n380\n00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.920\nshow you what that looks like.\n\n381\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.730\nThings like criminal law which is where\nwe get into the vagaries and the little\n\n382\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.960\neddies and backwaters of what country\nsays what, and what is or is not allowed.\n\n383\n00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.630\nBy the way it is illegal, in certain\ncountries of the world to use as I mention\n\n384\n00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:55.130\ncertain encryption algorithms\nof a certain strength.\n\n385\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.490\nYou may not be able to use them legally,\nyou may not possess them as a matter of\n\n386\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.730\nfact coming across the border and\nhaving them on your laptop or\n\n387\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.740\non your phone or on a technology\nplatform that you can access may access\n\n388\n00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.660\nmay actually be illegal and may if you\nare found to do so and the government\n\n389\n00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.530\nhas an interest in prosecuting you, may\nactually wind up in a fine or jail time.\n\n390\n00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.940\nYou may be accused, and may be\ndragged into court in this country for\n\n391\n00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.910\ndoing that or having that.\n\n392\n00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.570\nSo you have to really think about that and\nbe aware of that, right?\n\n393\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.080\nNothing like getting off the plane and-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n394\n00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.710\n>> Being thrown in shackles immediately,\n\n395\n00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.000\nand escorted to jail, right,\nto really make your Monday morning\n\n396\n00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.410\nwhen you're trying to get\nto a business meeting.\n\n397\n00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:30.330\nSo just keep that in mind,\n\n398\n00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:33.560\nthese are things that can happen,\nthings that we have to be concerned about.\n\n399\n00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.310\nWith regards to the appraisal of legal\nissues relevant to cloud computing,\n\n400\n00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.100\nwe have to understand the operational\nenvironment, in other words, right?\n\n401\n00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.690\nAnd I've talked before,\nin prior episodes, about operational or\n\n402\n00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:46.760\nsituational awareness, and the idea is\nto say, we have to have that radar,\n\n403\n00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:51.930\nthat 360 degree view, of what's going on\naround us and understand that our data and\n\n404\n00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:55.290\nour systems are not gonna be\nlimited to one geography anymore.\n\n405\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.070\nIn the cloud they're free ranging,\nfree flowing and\n\n406\n00:20:58.070 --> 00:21:02.090\nthey can move between borders as\nDaniel was saying, as easily as just\n\n407\n00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.180\ndriving from one part of the road to\nthe next part of the road, right?\n\n408\n00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.350\nThere may or\nmay not be a demarkation there.\n\n409\n00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.850\nThere's usually a cop behind a sign with\nthe radar gun that's waiting for you.\n\n410\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.070\nYou may not see them, right?\n\n411\n00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.880\nAt least in the South anyway,\nthat's what tends to happen, right?\n\n412\n00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.530\nSo, the point is you may or\nmay not be told.\n\n413\n00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:18.700\nIt's on you.\n\n414\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.560\nRight, to understand and\nto be aware of that.\n\n415\n00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:24.170\nI know that we and\nI've asked you to bring up and\n\n416\n00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.530\nyou're going to show us in just a minute,\nsome of these various areas.\n\n417\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.870\nSo, we're going to start\nby talking about the OECD.\n\n418\n00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.020\nRight, the organization for\neconomic cooperation and development.\n\n419\n00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.040\nThis the OECD body has been around for\na long time and\n\n420\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.810\ncan we zoom in a little bit to see\nthe privacy principle specifically\n\n421\n00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:43.870\non those eight principles that you're\nkind of hovering over and pointing to?\n\n422\n00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:44.570\nRight there?\n\n423\n00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.210\nOutstanding.\n\n424\n00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.165\nIf I do one of these, shazam.\n\n425\n00:21:47.165 --> 00:21:48.785\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Do this and I'd pull it forward.\n\n426\n00:21:48.785 --> 00:21:49.565\nThat would be so\n\n427\n00:21:49.565 --> 00:21:52.655\ncool cuz it would actually look\nlike I was dragging the string.\n\n428\n00:21:52.655 --> 00:21:53.865\n>> Like a Jedi or something.\n\n429\n00:21:53.865 --> 00:21:55.135\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:56.593\n>> There are no privacy laws.\n\n431\n00:21:56.593 --> 00:21:58.595\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There is no border,\n\n432\n00:21:58.595 --> 00:22:00.297\nthe cloud is everywhere.\n\n433\n00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:02.172\nOf course it is, right?\n\n434\n00:22:02.172 --> 00:22:02.807\n[LAUGH] All right.\n\n435\n00:22:02.807 --> 00:22:03.727\nSo, OECD Privacy Principles.\n\n436\n00:22:03.727 --> 00:22:07.597\nAs a CCSP you want to make sure you\nunderstand the eight founding or\n\n437\n00:22:07.597 --> 00:22:08.907\nguideline principles.\n\n438\n00:22:08.907 --> 00:22:11.537\nThat OECD has laid out with\nregards to privacy and\n\n439\n00:22:11.537 --> 00:22:14.627\nthe management of publicly\nidentifiable information.\n\n440\n00:22:14.627 --> 00:22:19.237\nOr personally identifiable information,\nrather, PII, and the use of information.\n\n441\n00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:21.607\nThese principles underline\nmost of what we do.\n\n442\n00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:24.120\nMost of what we see,\nmost of what we know today.\n\n443\n00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.070\nWith regards to privacy regulation and\nprivacy standards around the world.\n\n444\n00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:32.130\nThey are the referenceable benchmarks that\nmost of the legislation that has been\n\n445\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.260\ncreated in the last 20\nto 30 years is based on.\n\n446\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:39.640\nSo we can see here that we have collection\nlimitation, the idea that we should only\n\n447\n00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:43.420\ncollect data given the purview of what\nwe're looking to do that is relevant,\n\n448\n00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.350\nthat is pertinent to what we need.\n\n449\n00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.610\nIf we don't need to know your mother's\nmaiden name we shouldn't ask you for it.\n\n450\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:51.200\nWe don't need to know your birthday,\nwe shouldn't ask you for that.\n\n451\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:55.750\nIf we need to know what your gender is, we\nshould ask you and then obviously make it\n\n452\n00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:58.360\navailable to you in the sense of\nthe choices that are available so\n\n453\n00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.570\nthat you can make the appropriate choice,\nprovide that information.\n\n454\n00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.330\nAnd then we have to use all\nthe other standard guidelines here\n\n455\n00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:05.950\nin order to make sure the principles,\n\n456\n00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.440\nto make sure that we manage that data\nappropriately throughout its life cycle.\n\n457\n00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.520\nSo collection limitation is important.\n\n458\n00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.990\nData quality is important.\n\n459\n00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:15.680\nThe quality of the data\nwe collect must be,\n\n460\n00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.230\nif at all possible at\nthe highest standard.\n\n461\n00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.970\nSo we have to validate integrity,\nwe have to make sure we understand\n\n462\n00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.000\nthat when we collect data, we have to\nensure that the data stays relevant and\n\n463\n00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.330\nthat the quality is going to be there\nthroughout the data life cycle.\n\n464\n00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:33.280\nWe can't start out with really great data\nand then through transformation and use.\n\n465\n00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.320\nWhy that with data that's no\nlonger relevant to the person or\n\n466\n00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:38.950\nthe entity we collected it from\nbecause then it's erroneous and\n\n467\n00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.190\nno longer has any sense or value.\n\n468\n00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.531\nOur purpose classification,\nwe have to tell you, right?\n\n469\n00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:48.456\nAs the user linked to,\nin principle, for use limitation,\n\n470\n00:23:48.456 --> 00:23:50.348\nwe have to tell you, right?\n\n471\n00:23:50.348 --> 00:23:54.983\nWhat the idea is that we're gonna use this\ndata for, we have to make it clear to you,\n\n472\n00:23:54.983 --> 00:23:58.840\nand also link to principle number\nseven individual participation.\n\n473\n00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.010\nWe have to give you an opt out,\nopt in clause, right?\n\n474\n00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.780\nSo we have to allow you to say yes or no,\nI will or will not participate, I do or\n\n475\n00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.480\ndon't want my data to be collected.\n\n476\n00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.910\nThe data can only be used\nunder these conditions.\n\n477\n00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.740\nIf you do collect it, use limitation and\npurpose specification.\n\n478\n00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.680\nThe data is being collected for\nthese particular purposes, right?\n\n479\n00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.260\nSo purpose specification.\n\n480\n00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.019\nWhen you sign up for, let's say a credit\ncard or an account online, or whatever,\n\n481\n00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:25.409\nin the United States, or I'm sure in\nmost places around the world today.\n\n482\n00:24:25.409 --> 00:24:28.746\nThe vendor has to read to you,\nyour several statements of intent.\n\n483\n00:24:28.746 --> 00:24:30.890\nThey have to tell you this is what\nwe're gonna do with the data.\n\n484\n00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.380\nWe're gonna use it in these ways.\n\n485\n00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:33.890\nWe're gonna manage it in these ways.\n\n486\n00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:37.150\nWe're gonna store it in this way, and\nwe're gonna do this with it, right?\n\n487\n00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.140\nWe're not gonna do that,\nbut we're gonna do this.\n\n488\n00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.820\nThese things that they tell you are all\nbased on the OECD privacy principles.\n\n489\n00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:45.840\nSo we've talked about purpose\nspecification, use limitation.\n\n490\n00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.300\nSecurity safeguards,\nwe have to manage that data and\n\n491\n00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.810\nsafeguard the data while\nit's in our possession.\n\n492\n00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.680\nWe should encrypt it, we should use PCA,\n\n493\n00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.700\nPCIDSS, alignment to be able to process\nthe data securely if it's payment related.\n\n494\n00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.910\nWe should make sure that we are using\nmulti-factor authentication,\n\n495\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:03.980\nif that's appropriate.\n\n496\n00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.510\nWhatever the case may be.\n\n497\n00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:10.140\nOpenness principle, there should be\ntransparency into the use of the data,\n\n498\n00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.920\nin the sense that the uses of\nthe data should be well documented.\n\n499\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.330\nNot the data itself,\npeople often confuse this, right?\n\n500\n00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.230\nYou don't wanna expose all\nthe confidential data.\n\n501\n00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:20.460\nBut you wanna understand what the data is\nbeing used for, under what conditions,\n\n502\n00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.010\nby whom and for what end?\n\n503\n00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:23.248\nThat's what openness deals with.\n\n504\n00:25:23.248 --> 00:25:25.927\nIndividual participation,\nwe talked about opt in, opt out.\n\n505\n00:25:25.927 --> 00:25:29.863\nAnd then accountability, number 8,\nwhich embraces all the other principles,\n\n506\n00:25:29.863 --> 00:25:31.868\nwraps them up and rolls them altogether.\n\n507\n00:25:31.868 --> 00:25:36.094\nThe idea that ultimately we have to,\nas the data collector, the data owner and\n\n508\n00:25:36.094 --> 00:25:37.260\nthe data custodian.\n\n509\n00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.080\nWe'll talk about these roles later.\n\n510\n00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.575\nThe idea that we have to have\naccountability at all levels of the use of\n\n511\n00:25:42.575 --> 00:25:43.188\nthat data.\n\n512\n00:25:43.188 --> 00:25:47.355\nSo if the collecting party has the data\nand they're not using it responsibly,\n\n513\n00:25:47.355 --> 00:25:51.348\nthen they ultimately bear accountability\nfor those issues and concerns.\n\n514\n00:25:51.348 --> 00:25:54.747\nThere may be penalties, there may be\nissues that are gonna be resolved in\n\n515\n00:25:54.747 --> 00:25:57.250\nthe criminal court,\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n516\n00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.110\nBut if we go to the trouble\nof getting the data from you,\n\n517\n00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.390\nwe have an implied promise that\nwe're gonna securely manage it.\n\n518\n00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.140\nAnd so, we do have to understand that and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n519\n00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.890\nSo the OECD principles are very important.\n\n520\n00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:12.190\nAs the CCSP candidate, you would wanna\nknow what these eight principles are and\n\n521\n00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.400\nbe sure you understand them, and\nthat you can apply them if asked.\n\n522\n00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.020\nWith regards to how\nthey link into privacy,\n\n523\n00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:20.580\nwe actually need to go back\nto the desktop, please.\n\n524\n00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.600\nWe're gonna have a bunch of stuff\nwe're gonna talk a look at, so\n\n525\n00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.370\nwe're gonna stay in this area for a couple\nminutes, so let's, if we could zoom out.\n\n526\n00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.568\nSo let me do this, [NOISE] right?\n\n527\n00:26:28.568 --> 00:26:30.210\nLet me use my Jedi powers.\n\n528\n00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.930\nSo let's move over, I'll go this way\nmove over one, thank you sir and\n\n529\n00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.090\nlet's zoom back in.\n\n530\n00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:37.968\nLook at that.\n\n531\n00:26:37.968 --> 00:26:40.626\nA little too far,\npush that back out just a little.\n\n532\n00:26:40.626 --> 00:26:43.086\nThere we go, and I'll move it over.\n\n533\n00:26:43.086 --> 00:26:44.866\n[LAUGH] Awesome.\n\n534\n00:26:44.866 --> 00:26:49.649\nAll right, so we have as you can see here,\nthe EU 9546 directive,\n\n535\n00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:55.508\nthe formal name directive 9546 EC of the\nEuropean parliament and of the council.\n\n536\n00:26:55.508 --> 00:26:57.988\nSigned on 24, or put into law.\n\n537\n00:26:57.988 --> 00:27:03.308\nVoted into effect on 24, October, 1995,\non the, if you scroll over we will see.\n\n538\n00:27:03.308 --> 00:27:08.234\nOn the, there we go,\non the protection of individuals with,\n\n539\n00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:12.878\nkeep going, regard to\nthe processing of personal data and\n\n540\n00:27:12.878 --> 00:27:16.886\non the free,\nlike a typewriter ding, back over.\n\n541\n00:27:16.886 --> 00:27:19.238\n[LAUGH] On the free movement of such data.\n\n542\n00:27:19.238 --> 00:27:23.033\nGood news is, you don't need to know all\nof that, what you really just need to know\n\n543\n00:27:23.033 --> 00:27:27.116\nis that directive 9546 is gonna be an EU\ndirective, certainly you wanna know that.\n\n544\n00:27:27.116 --> 00:27:30.612\nAnd it's focused on data protection and\nit's gonna be one\n\n545\n00:27:30.612 --> 00:27:35.533\nof the fundamental underlying laws that is\nguided data protection in the EU now for\n\n546\n00:27:35.533 --> 00:27:37.330\nover 20 years, right?\n\n547\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.040\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n548\n00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.430\nIt is important at some point for you to\nprobably read through this legislation.\n\n549\n00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.320\nIt's not very long but it is a little\nbit of a trudge in the sense,\n\n550\n00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.910\nit's a lot of legalese, right?\n\n551\n00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:50.100\nIt is a legislative document.\n\n552\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.980\nIt has all the legalese\nassociated with that format.\n\n553\n00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.700\nBut as a CCSP, will be helpful for\nyou to be aware of what's in there.\n\n554\n00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.370\nTo understand it,\nto have a reference point for it.\n\n555\n00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.960\nAgain, if you're not doing business\nin Europe, you may really never\n\n556\n00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.230\ncome up against this law, and\nyou may not have to worry about it.\n\n557\n00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.102\nBut if you're a North American business,\na United States centric business\n\n558\n00:28:08.102 --> 00:28:10.958\nspecifically, and\nyou are doing business with the EU.\n\n559\n00:28:10.958 --> 00:28:12.378\nYou have to be aware of this law.\n\n560\n00:28:12.378 --> 00:28:15.913\nAnd as I mentioned, safe harbor, or\nnow ultimately what will probably be known\n\n561\n00:28:15.913 --> 00:28:18.680\nas privacy shield going forward,\nwith regards to this.\n\n562\n00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.210\nSo we do wanna have note of that.\n\n563\n00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.916\nDo be aware of the EU data\nprotection directive.\n\n564\n00:28:22.916 --> 00:28:27.610\nWe wanna think about other directives\nthat may come into play here.\n\n565\n00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.500\nEuropean Union in the last several years\nhas also passed something called the right\n\n566\n00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.500\nto be forgotten.\n\n567\n00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.780\nWhere EU citizens essentially\nnow have the right to claim\n\n568\n00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:39.020\ntheir personal information and say to\na vendor, I wanna remove from your system.\n\n569\n00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.550\nAnd you have to then, as the vendor,\ntake steps to not only do so, but\n\n570\n00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.190\nto securely do so and\nthen validate to the user,\n\n571\n00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.500\nunder that strict guidance that you\nhave actually removed their PII,\n\n572\n00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.020\ntheir personally identifiable\ninformation from the system.\n\n573\n00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:54.940\nSo they have the right, essentially,\nas an individual citizen\n\n574\n00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.600\nto request to be forgotten, essentially\nalmost like a push button, right?\n\n575\n00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.990\nSo it's actually kind of interesting.\n\n576\n00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.280\nAgain, in the United States,\n\n577\n00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.180\nwe don't tend to have this\nlevel of protection right now.\n\n578\n00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.990\nBut in certain parts of the world, we do.\n\n579\n00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.700\nSo this is obviously something again\nthe CCSP would wanna be aware of and\n\n580\n00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.730\nwant to know about.\n\n581\n00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.160\nSo things like this become very important,\nright?\n\n582\n00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:17.010\nWe have legal controls and considered\nlegal issues that are being addressed by\n\n583\n00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:22.930\nthese controls, by the 9546 directive,\nby the OECD principles on privacy,\n\n584\n00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:28.220\nby any of the requirements that we\nmay have to meet and/or ascribe to,\n\n585\n00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.140\nto do business in certain country, right?\n\n586\n00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.300\nThey may or may not be important for\nus collectively, but\n\n587\n00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.540\nthey're important to us individually\nif we are gonna be bound by them.\n\n588\n00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.931\nRemember also, we have supply chain\nrisk here that we have to assess and\n\n589\n00:29:39.931 --> 00:29:40.563\ntalk about.\n\n590\n00:29:40.563 --> 00:29:45.157\nWe don't have to go look it up again, but\nwe have talked about this, 800161 before.\n\n591\n00:29:45.157 --> 00:29:48.422\nThe guidance on supply chain risk and\nmanagement and the supply chain, or\n\n592\n00:29:48.422 --> 00:29:50.118\nrisk management in the supply chain.\n\n593\n00:29:50.118 --> 00:29:51.398\nWe are responsible, right?\n\n594\n00:29:51.398 --> 00:29:55.542\nAs CCSP's, as practitioners,\nwe are responsible as vendors for\n\n595\n00:29:55.542 --> 00:30:00.457\nunderstanding that we are responsible for\nthe action of our subcontractors.\n\n596\n00:30:00.457 --> 00:30:04.150\nIt's very, very important for\nus to consider and to think about as well.\n\n597\n00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.210\nBecause we have to understand how\nthose actions will impact us and\n\n598\n00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:09.680\nmanage the risk associated with that.\n\n599\n00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:12.240\nWe need to go back up to the screen\nagain if we could, please?\n\n600\n00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.640\nWe need to take a look at, I know we have\na bunch of ISO standards there, and I'm\n\n601\n00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.150\ngonna want you to find one in particular,\nso I'll give you a second to hover.\n\n602\n00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:19.868\nI think it's the very\nlast one we pulled up.\n\n603\n00:30:19.868 --> 00:30:22.508\nThe 27037.\n\n604\n00:30:22.508 --> 00:30:25.380\n27037, the cloud forensic standard,\ndo you have that one?\n\n605\n00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.240\nOkay, perfect.\n\n606\n00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.898\nIf we could zoom in on that one for\njust a minute.\n\n607\n00:30:27.898 --> 00:30:32.048\nWe also have to think about some of\nthe requirements that we may as a CCSP,\n\n608\n00:30:32.048 --> 00:30:35.044\nbe beholden to or\nhave to operate within and around,\n\n609\n00:30:35.044 --> 00:30:37.308\nin support with regards to forensics.\n\n610\n00:30:37.308 --> 00:30:41.533\nThe examination of incident response\nrelated data that may become an issue,\n\n611\n00:30:41.533 --> 00:30:43.938\nand the preservation of digital evidence.\n\n612\n00:30:43.938 --> 00:30:46.984\nBut specific to\nthe identification collection and\n\n613\n00:30:46.984 --> 00:30:52.190\npreservation of digital evidence, excuse\nme, and how that applies to the cloud.\n\n614\n00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.230\nAnd so, ISO 27037 as you can see there,\n\n615\n00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:58.420\nis the standard that helps\nus to understand that.\n\n616\n00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.930\nAnd we would wanna take note of this.\n\n617\n00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:04.710\nThis may impact our ability to understand\nhow to engage in forensics activities.\n\n618\n00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.280\nRemember, depending on the service\nmodel we are using, SAS, PAS, or\n\n619\n00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:12.670\nIAS, we as the customer may not have\nany kind of capability or right,\n\n620\n00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.490\nor indeed control to execute any\nof the guidance in this document.\n\n621\n00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.740\nThis may be the provider, and\n\n622\n00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.220\nthe cloud provider may have\nto do this on our behalf.\n\n623\n00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.540\nDepending on the nature of the service\nmodel we use, we may have the ability,\n\n624\n00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.690\nthe right, and the capability to go in and\nexecute some or\n\n625\n00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.880\nall of the requirements around\ngathering digital evidence.\n\n626\n00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.225\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n627\n00:31:31.225 --> 00:31:34.824\nE-discovery falls into this picture\nhere and plays a part here as well.\n\n628\n00:31:34.824 --> 00:31:39.813\nThe idea that when we are thinking about\nnot just how to frontly examine data,\n\n629\n00:31:39.813 --> 00:31:43.208\nbut how to ultimately grab\ndata under a court order.\n\n630\n00:31:43.208 --> 00:31:46.011\nPreserve it and then present it\nat some point in the future,\n\n631\n00:31:46.011 --> 00:31:47.928\nwith regards to the pursuit of the case.\n\n632\n00:31:47.928 --> 00:31:52.787\nWe have to think about how this standard\nand other standards may apply and so,\n\n633\n00:31:52.787 --> 00:31:56.550\nthe CCSP has to be aware of what\nthese kinds of requirement.\n\n634\n00:31:56.550 --> 00:32:00.867\nThese rules and the stipulation of the\nguidelines that they are presenting will\n\n635\n00:32:00.867 --> 00:32:02.575\nbe helpful to us to follow.\n\n636\n00:32:02.575 --> 00:32:05.065\nWe have to get formally\ntrained on this stuff, right?\n\n637\n00:32:05.065 --> 00:32:08.025\nThis is not something you read a document\non and go, yeah, I can go do that.\n\n638\n00:32:08.025 --> 00:32:10.566\nI mean, you could, but you're not gonna be\neffective at it, let's put it that way.\n\n639\n00:32:10.566 --> 00:32:13.805\nYou have to understand how to go out and\nactually get formal training.\n\n640\n00:32:13.805 --> 00:32:17.198\nNot just on forensics but\nspecifically on cloud forensics,\n\n641\n00:32:17.198 --> 00:32:19.401\nbecause it is a very different animal.\n\n642\n00:32:19.401 --> 00:32:21.513\nThe concepts are the same, right?\n\n643\n00:32:21.513 --> 00:32:25.207\nDynamic evidence is dynamic evidence,\nstuff in memory is still dynamic and\n\n644\n00:32:25.207 --> 00:32:28.785\nhas to be treated that way regardless\nof whether we own the infrastructure\n\n645\n00:32:28.785 --> 00:32:29.496\nphysically.\n\n646\n00:32:29.496 --> 00:32:31.550\nOr whether we are renting it\nvirtually through the cloud.\n\n647\n00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:35.880\nBut the ability to get to that data,\nthe understanding of how to preserve it.\n\n648\n00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.140\nThe understanding of what the chain of\nevidence looks like as it passes from\n\n649\n00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.540\nthe cloud provider\nthrough to the customer.\n\n650\n00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.730\nThrough designated representatives or\nwhatever that may look like,\n\n651\n00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.330\nis gonna be very different than if we're\nexecuting the incident response and\n\n652\n00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.280\nthe forensic examination, ourselves.\n\n653\n00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.310\nAnd as a result, we have to get trained on\nand really have a broad understanding of\n\n654\n00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.820\nhow to apply this knowledge\nto do this properly,\n\n655\n00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.050\ncuz we only get one chance to do this,\nright?\n\n656\n00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.530\nIf we screw it up or we don't do it\nthe right way, the evidence is tainted.\n\n657\n00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.280\nAnd as a result, we're not gonna\nbe able to use it, claim it and\n\n658\n00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.460\ninteract with it and have it available for\nus during the trial.\n\n659\n00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.084\nIt's essentially like it never existed.\n\n660\n00:33:11.084 --> 00:33:16.189\nSo E-Discovery and Cloud Forensics\nbecomes incredibly important for\n\n661\n00:33:16.189 --> 00:33:17.982\nthe CCSP to understand.\n\n662\n00:33:17.982 --> 00:33:21.537\nAnd incredibly important for us to have\nguidance around in terms of whatever\n\n663\n00:33:21.537 --> 00:33:24.603\nthe standards and ramifications are,\nif we don't follow them.\n\n664\n00:33:24.603 --> 00:33:27.170\nThat may be available to us,\neither internationally,\n\n665\n00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.095\nnationally, locally, or\nsome combination of those things.\n\n666\n00:33:30.095 --> 00:33:33.191\nE-discovery is the process, essentially,\nwhere we go out and look for\n\n667\n00:33:33.191 --> 00:33:34.015\nelectronic data.\n\n668\n00:33:34.015 --> 00:33:37.597\nWe talked in a couple of different\nprior episodes about E-Discovery.\n\n669\n00:33:37.597 --> 00:33:40.794\nTalked about showing up and\nserving in E-Discovery order and\n\n670\n00:33:40.794 --> 00:33:43.780\nbe able to garner that data,\nand how we would do that?\n\n671\n00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.580\nTalk about the fact that you may not\nbe able to show up at the data center's\n\n672\n00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.680\ndoorstep and serve them with\nan E-Discovery order, even though the data\n\n673\n00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.400\nis there because you may not know\nas the customer where your data is.\n\n674\n00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.980\nAnd E-Discovery order's\nbrought against the customer.\n\n675\n00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.689\nWe want your data.\n\n676\n00:33:57.689 --> 00:34:01.379\nWe want this based on a retention\nperiod of 30 day or 6 months.\n\n677\n00:34:01.379 --> 00:34:02.541\nWe expect to see this data.\n\n678\n00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:04.516\nWe're gonna give you an E-Discovery order.\n\n679\n00:34:04.516 --> 00:34:07.128\nYou may say to the person that,\nhence needing E-Discovery order, hey,\n\n680\n00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:08.277\nthat's nice but you know what?\n\n681\n00:34:08.277 --> 00:34:10.860\nI don't actually own the data directly.\n\n682\n00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.870\nI do own it but\nI don't have a direct possession of it.\n\n683\n00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.620\nIt's being hosted in the cloud.\n\n684\n00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:17.250\nAnd I can show it to you.\n\n685\n00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.370\nBut to get a copy of it,\nwe have to go to our cloud vendor, right?\n\n686\n00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.730\nAnd actually work with them to\nget a forensically sound copy\n\n687\n00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.840\naccording to these guidelines, presented\nfor you that meets the burden of proof for\n\n688\n00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.160\nyour E-Discovery order.\n\n689\n00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.150\nAnd then the requirements have to\nbe essentially then stipulated.\n\n690\n00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:35.210\nYou say, okay, well,\nhere's our cloud provider.\n\n691\n00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:37.350\nHere's what you gotta do, and\nyou have to go serve them.\n\n692\n00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.280\nAnd we may then have to sign off\non a piece of paper that says,\n\n693\n00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.050\nwe allow that to take place or\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n694\n00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:45.500\nIt's important for the CSSP to understand\n\n695\n00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:49.195\nthat aside from all the stuff we\njust discussed, pre-planning, right?\n\n696\n00:34:49.195 --> 00:34:50.420\nIs really very critical here.\n\n697\n00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.770\nWe talked about planning to be successful.\n\n698\n00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.300\nHave you negotiated into\nyour hosting agreement,\n\n699\n00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.990\nthe idea that E-Discovery\ncould take place?\n\n700\n00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.656\nHave you negotiated into your hosting\nagreement what the rules will be,\n\n701\n00:35:02.656 --> 00:35:06.460\nwith regards to 27037, what we just\nhad up on the screen a minute ago?\n\n702\n00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.659\nHave you put all that information\ninto the hosting agreement,\n\n703\n00:35:09.659 --> 00:35:13.898\nhas the cloud provided or agreed with you,\nthat if there is an E-Discovery issue.\n\n704\n00:35:13.898 --> 00:35:16.836\nOr if there's a forensic\nexamination of data issue.\n\n705\n00:35:16.836 --> 00:35:20.456\nIf there's an incident response issue\nthat they will follow these guidelines,\n\n706\n00:35:20.456 --> 00:35:22.190\nwhatever the guidelines are.\n\n707\n00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:25.620\nMaybe they're 27037 based,\nmaybe they're not.\n\n708\n00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.180\nIf you haven't finalized what\nthat looks like ahead of time,\n\n709\n00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:30.970\nif it's not negotiated into\nyour hosting agreement.\n\n710\n00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:34.270\nYou may be in for a nasty surprise when\nyou go to actually figure this out.\n\n711\n00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:38.520\nMany cloud providers today, will tell you\nwhat their particular stance on this is,\n\n712\n00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.720\nwill give you guidance on what\nthey will and will not allow, and\n\n713\n00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.140\nhow they will pursue this.\n\n714\n00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.960\nBut you have to obviously, work with\nthem and know that ahead of time.\n\n715\n00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.298\nSo it's very important for\nyou to think about this, and\n\n716\n00:35:48.298 --> 00:35:50.001\nhow this is going to ultimately happen.\n\n717\n00:35:50.001 --> 00:35:53.741\nIf you don't negotiate this up front,\nyou may find out that it's much tougher to\n\n718\n00:35:53.741 --> 00:35:57.263\nfigure it out on the fly, when this has\nto be done under court order, right?\n\n719\n00:35:57.263 --> 00:36:00.643\nAt the actual time you're being served,\nit may not be the best time to request\n\n720\n00:36:00.643 --> 00:36:03.350\nguidance on whether or\nnot you're gonna allow this to occur.\n\n721\n00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:04.880\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n722\n00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.270\nAll of this, almost without exception\nto the cloud, is done online.\n\n723\n00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.955\nAnd, as a result, we really have\nto adjust our approaches and\n\n724\n00:36:10.955 --> 00:36:13.915\nadjust our expectation of\nwhat E-Discovery will be.\n\n725\n00:36:13.915 --> 00:36:15.005\nBecause systems, as I said,\n\n726\n00:36:15.005 --> 00:36:18.235\nare no longer on-premise, with\nthe exception of on-prem private cloud.\n\n727\n00:36:18.235 --> 00:36:21.102\nWe always have been carving out\nthat exception every discussion\n\n728\n00:36:21.102 --> 00:36:23.072\nin almost every episode,\nwe've talked about that in.\n\n729\n00:36:23.072 --> 00:36:26.872\nBecause there is that well-known and\nwell understood exception today,\n\n730\n00:36:26.872 --> 00:36:30.932\nwhere if you own the cloud infrastructure\non prem, you're running it yourself.\n\n731\n00:36:30.932 --> 00:36:33.072\nYou are gonna be able to go to\nthe physical infrastructure and\n\n732\n00:36:33.072 --> 00:36:34.002\npull it directly.\n\n733\n00:36:34.002 --> 00:36:36.672\nBut if it's not on prem,\nthen the systems are somewhere else.\n\n734\n00:36:36.672 --> 00:36:37.852\nYou have to understand that.\n\n735\n00:36:37.852 --> 00:36:42.450\nThere may be highly complex requirements,\nboth legal and\n\n736\n00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.660\nprocedural to go through to actually\nget clearance to access that data.\n\n737\n00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.330\nAnd we have to understand that because\nthere may be rules by country and\n\n738\n00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:53.820\nby area that may stipulate how that has\nto happen within what time frame, or\n\n739\n00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.560\nwhether it can happen or not.\n\n740\n00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.440\nAnd the other thing that we also have\nto consider in a cloud environment with\n\n741\n00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.010\nregards to E-Discovery\nis multi-tenant hosting.\n\n742\n00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.990\nYou may get served as a cloud provider\nwith an E-Discovery order saying,\n\n743\n00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.380\nI want all the company data for company X.\n\n744\n00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.320\nBut when you walk in, right?\n\n745\n00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.560\nAnd you go grab that data,\nyou're just giving,\n\n746\n00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.598\nthe cloud provider is just providing\nthat data just for company X.\n\n747\n00:37:15.598 --> 00:37:20.450\nIf the E-Discovery order was not drafted\nthe right way, or if purposely made broad.\n\n748\n00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:23.430\nThen you may have to give up\ndata as a cloud provider for\n\n749\n00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:25.420\nmultiple tenants on the same server,\n\n750\n00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.450\neven though those tenants are not part\nof the E-Discovery order, formally.\n\n751\n00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.303\nAnd that data may now become\npart of an investigation and\n\n752\n00:37:31.303 --> 00:37:35.138\nmay become something that is investigated\nand they actually is examined.\n\n753\n00:37:35.138 --> 00:37:39.796\nAnd so, you have to be aware of the fact\nthat as a customer, you may be hosting on\n\n754\n00:37:39.796 --> 00:37:43.978\na system without your knowledge\nthat may be subject to E-Discovery.\n\n755\n00:37:43.978 --> 00:37:46.964\nAnd your data may actually be pulled in,\nin that broad net,\n\n756\n00:37:46.964 --> 00:37:49.550\neven though you may not\nhave any knowledge of that.\n\n757\n00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:54.050\nAnd the cloud provider may normally not\nhave a legal obligation to tell you\n\n758\n00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.620\nthat your data has been\nbrought in under E-Discovery.\n\n759\n00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:00.024\nAs a matter of fact, they probably\nwill not tell you because they're\n\n760\n00:38:00.024 --> 00:38:02.841\nprobably barred from making\nyou aware of that activity,\n\n761\n00:38:02.841 --> 00:38:06.202\nbecause the court order says specifically,\nhey, keep it secret.\n\n762\n00:38:06.202 --> 00:38:09.831\nCan't tell this person we're examining\ntheir data cuz we don't want them to know\n\n763\n00:38:09.831 --> 00:38:12.106\nuntil we're ready to charge\nthem with something.\n\n764\n00:38:12.106 --> 00:38:15.060\nOr we find out they're not guilty and\nwe don't wanna charge them.\n\n765\n00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.760\nBut there is a lot of time this is\nalso captured under the guise of\n\n766\n00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.870\nnational security.\n\n767\n00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:20.220\nHey, we need this data.\n\n768\n00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.578\nWe're pulling it in under this particular\norder and you can not tell Mr.\n\n769\n00:38:23.578 --> 00:38:27.420\nand Mrs. Provider, any of\nthe customers in any of these systems,\n\n770\n00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.534\nthat we're looking at anything.\n\n771\n00:38:28.534 --> 00:38:32.050\nYou're barred from doing that, here's\nessentially a court order that says,\n\n772\n00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.870\nif you do that, you're going to jail for\n\n773\n00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.070\n50 years because you violated\nnational security laws.\n\n774\n00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:40.280\nThis happens a lot more than we\nwould actually care to admit or\n\n775\n00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.770\ncare to really be aware\nof in many countries,\n\n776\n00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:46.165\nnot just in the United States, not just\nin Europe, but around the world today.\n\n777\n00:38:46.165 --> 00:38:48.440\nThis is happening on a regular basis.\n\n778\n00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.520\nAnd data is always running through\nsomeone's system being examined somewhere.\n\n779\n00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.700\nIf you're operating in the cloud, you need\nto have that assumption in your mind.\n\n780\n00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.070\nThat as a customer, people are looking\nat my data, whether I know it or not.\n\n781\n00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.000\nWhether I want them to or\n\n782\n00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.710\nnot, and that anything I don't wanna have,\nmade knowledgeable to other people,\n\n783\n00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:07.360\nthat somebody somewhere, somehow,\nsome way, can see if they want to.\n\n784\n00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.450\nThey may not want to, but\nif they want to, I shouldn't put it\n\n785\n00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.130\non the cloud in the first place, or\nput it in the cloud in the first place.\n\n786\n00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:15.490\nI should keep it somewhere\nelse because the chance of it,\n\n787\n00:39:15.490 --> 00:39:17.220\nsomebody will have\nthe opportunity to see it.\n\n788\n00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:21.188\nSo we have to think about consider and\nreally understand all these concerns as we\n\n789\n00:39:21.188 --> 00:39:25.455\nbegin to discuss and ultimately examine\nwhat legal compliance and risk management,\n\n790\n00:39:25.455 --> 00:39:27.722\nand compliance within\nthe cloud looks like.\n\n791\n00:39:27.722 --> 00:39:30.044\n>> Wow, it is definitely a large subject.\n\n792\n00:39:30.044 --> 00:39:32.954\nThis is not something that we\ncan really take very lightly.\n\n793\n00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:36.566\nWe all are underneath some\nsort of formal law and\n\n794\n00:39:36.566 --> 00:39:41.125\nlegalization of things, and\nlegalization of others.\n\n795\n00:39:41.125 --> 00:39:45.828\nAnd if you don't have a good idea, that\nsituational awareness, I do kind of think\n\n796\n00:39:45.828 --> 00:39:49.522\nof security professionals as\nspec ops in the military, right?\n\n797\n00:39:49.522 --> 00:39:53.078\nThey do the job that nobody else\ncan do and they like to say,\n\n798\n00:39:53.078 --> 00:39:55.267\nkeep your head on a swivel, right?\n\n799\n00:39:55.267 --> 00:40:00.140\nA 360-degree orientation, you always have\nto see where the attack is coming from.\n\n800\n00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:04.008\nAnd sometimes the attack, per se,\nis going to be in the form of well,\n\n801\n00:40:04.008 --> 00:40:07.370\nyou have broken a law and now,\nwe're gonna come after you.\n\n802\n00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:10.804\nSo you have to understand what laws you're\ngoing to be working in regardless of\n\n803\n00:40:10.804 --> 00:40:12.268\nthe environment that you may be.\n\n804\n00:40:12.268 --> 00:40:14.381\nYou gotta understand you're\npassing through borders.\n\n805\n00:40:14.381 --> 00:40:17.363\nYou have to take all of\nthese things into account so\n\n806\n00:40:17.363 --> 00:40:21.980\nthat you can set up your environment to\nbe as compliant as you possibly can be.\n\n807\n00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.620\nAnd then if anything does happen,\n\n808\n00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.450\nGod forbid, you can then work\nas compliant as you can be.\n\n809\n00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:32.350\nGiving them the data that they've require\nand trying to be very helpful for them.\n\n810\n00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.756\nAnd that's always the best way to be,\n\n811\n00:40:33.756 --> 00:40:36.600\n[LAUGH] cuz otherwise,\nyou've made a powerful enemy.\n\n812\n00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.240\nNot something you wanna do.\n\n813\n00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:41.800\nAdam, there's a lot to do with this and\nI know we've got a lot more to go through,\n\n814\n00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.760\nbut we're sorely out of time for\nthis episode.\n\n815\n00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.930\nSo, it looks like we'll have\nto jump into a part two.\n\n816\n00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:48.523\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou good people there.\n\n817\n00:40:48.523 --> 00:40:51.240\nBut as for this,\nwe're signing off for ITProTV.\n\n818\n00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.656\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowry.\n\n819\n00:40:54.385 --> 00:40:56.917\n>> I'm being secure and not saying\nanything unless there's a court order.\n\n820\n00:40:56.917 --> 00:40:58.403\n>> He's the NSA, never say anything.\n\n821\n00:40:58.403 --> 00:41:00.118\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll see you next time,\n\n822\n00:41:00.118 -->

everybody is also.\n\n12\n00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.000\nWe're gonna continue, as Danny was saying,\nour conversation around the ideas behind\n\n13\n00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.060\nprivacy issues, jurisdictional variances\nunderstanding what will be compliant, what\n\n14\n00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.970\nis risky behavior, how do we avoid that,\nall this stuff we've been discussing.\n\n15\n00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.160\nWe want to just circle back to\nthis idea that we've laid out.\n\n16\n00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.530\nActually at the very beginning, one of\nthe very first episodes we set up and\n\n17\n00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.150\ntalked about with you with\nregards to the CCSP material,\n\n18\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.190\nit's this idea of borderless computing.\n\n19\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.110\nOne of the key criteria,one of\nthe key things that we think about\n\n20\n00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.150\nwith regards to the cloud is that\nwe've talked about eliminating\n\n21\n00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.050\nthis idea of well defined borders time and\ntime again.\n\n22\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.810\nThe idea of being able to move between\nsystems without necessarily having\n\n23\n00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.090\nthe same demarcations that we\nmay see in the physical world.\n\n24\n00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450\nThe ability to be able to be Crossing\nmultiple jurisdictional areas,\n\n25\n00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.470\ngeographically.\n\n26\n00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.570\nBecause data is flowing back and forth and\n\n27\n00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.490\nwe may not regulate it the same\nway we do when it's going to be\n\n28\n00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.320\na system that is not cloud based, but\nrather physically present on our premises.\n\n29\n00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.510\nWithin the well defined border and or\n\n30\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.950\nthe well defined borders of our\norganization within our data center.\n\n31\n00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.290\nAnd you know, in the buildings we own,\nour property we own.\n\n32\n00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.220\nThings like that,\nthis is a little bit different.\n\n33\n00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.820\nThe Cloud may actually exist in\nmultiple places and indeed does.\n\n34\n00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.150\nAnd the data maybe resident physically\nsomewhere, we know it will be.\n\n35\n00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.610\nBut that somewhere may not\nbe on prem with us but\n\n36\n00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.700\nrather somewhere else remotely\non prem with our partner,\n\n37\n00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.440\nour cloud service provider and we are then\nremotely accessing it effectively.\n\n38\n00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.860\nAnd using it from a different area,\na different area code, zip code,\n\n39\n00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.490\ngeography if you will.\n\n40\n00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.390\nSo this idea of borderless computing\nreally does become something\n\n41\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.630\nthat we have to think about.\n\n42\n00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.490\nWe result, or see the results\nof borderless computing through\n\n43\n00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.170\nguards of things like\nthe globalization of services.\n\n44\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.660\nServices now become consumable\nanywhere from anywhere at anytime\n\n45\n00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.680\nwith really little to no lead time,\nand so we pay as we go.\n\n46\n00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.070\nAnd so\nwe consume IAS anywhere on the planet, and\n\n47\n00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.340\nit's gonna be essentially\nthe same kind of service.\n\n48\n00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.700\nWe could consume SaaS from a SaaS\napplication vendor and that application\n\n49\n00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.720\nfront end that web based API should indeed\nwill be available from anywhere as long\n\n50\n00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.540\nas we pay our bill we can get into that\nfront end and use our data from anywhere.\n\n51\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.000\nSo we see globalization of resources and\n\n52\n00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.640\nservices widely accessible,\nno perceived border.\n\n53\n00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.200\nAnd these are the kinds of\nthings that we have to consider\n\n54\n00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.390\nas we continue talking about legalization.\n\n55\n00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.020\nAs we continue talking about\nthe regulatory compliance concerns.\n\n56\n00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.450\nAnd the critical dos and\n\n57\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.050\ndon'ts that the CCSP has to be\naware of with regards to the Cloud.\n\n58\n00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.930\nWhen we think about PII,\nPersonally Identifiable Information, and\n\n59\n00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.760\nwe think about the things we've\ntalked about with regards to unique\n\n60\n00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.010\nidentifiers and ways to obscure them.\n\n61\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.850\nObfuscation, tokenization, anonymization,\n\n62\n00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.340\nmasking, are all technologies or\ntechniques that come to mind.\n\n63\n00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.990\nWe think about encryption and the use of\nthese kinds of secure storage mechanisms\n\n64\n00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.280\nand secured transmission mechanisms and\nsecure use mechanisms with data at rest,\n\n65\n00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.590\ndata in storage and or data in transit.\n\n66\n00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.500\nAnd we think about the need to understand,\nfirst of all, how to classify and\n\n67\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.230\nto categorize data to\nunderstand it is indeed,\n\n68\n00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.050\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n69\n00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.770\nOr it is something that's in the common\narea that everybody should be aware of.\n\n70\n00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.070\nMy name may not be personally identifiable\ninformation in every instance, but\n\n71\n00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.760\nmy birthday most likely will my user\nID within a company, you know, if you\n\n72\n00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.740\nhave a unique ID, if you have an employee\nID, or whatever you may refer to that as.\n\n73\n00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.880\nIf you have that, that is probably\na unique piece of personal identifiable\n\n74\n00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.680\ninformation in every instance,\nwith regards to that individual.\n\n75\n00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.880\nBut if we are tokenizing that\nif we are obfucsating that,\n\n76\n00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.580\nif we are making it, if we're anonymizing\nit, the representation of that may not be\n\n77\n00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.090\npersonally identifiable for the user\nbecause the token equivalent of my user ID\n\n78\n00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.550\nis irrelevant to anybody unless they\ncan look it up in the token system.\n\n79\n00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.160\nAnd look up the token server and\n\n80\n00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.790\ndo the cross walk in the token database\nto understand what data that refers to.\n\n81\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.650\nSo it may or may not be something\nwe have to protect is my point and\n\n82\n00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.640\nwe wanna be aware of that.\n\n83\n00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.640\nBut generically, with regards to PII,\nPersonally Identifiable Information,\n\n84\n00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.300\nwe do have to understand the roles\nthat we are going to see,\n\n85\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.820\nthe roles that we're\ngoing to interact with.\n\n86\n00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.490\nThe roles that we are going to\nhave to define to understand\n\n87\n00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.160\nwho is doing what with our data.\n\n88\n00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.510\nWho is for instance the data processor?\n\n89\n00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.330\nWho is the data controller?\n\n90\n00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.450\nWhat is the data referring to?\n\n91\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.680\nWho is the subject?\n\n92\n00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.890\nThese are things we would\nhave to be aware of.\n\n93\n00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.585\nWe've talked about some of\nthese roles very early on.\n\n94\n00:05:03.585 --> 00:05:07.535\nSome of our very first episodes with\nregards to the cloud computing solutions\n\n95\n00:05:07.535 --> 00:05:09.535\nand things that we would\nneed to be aware of.\n\n96\n00:05:09.535 --> 00:05:13.205\nWe wanna circle back to them and\nformally define them with regards to\n\n97\n00:05:13.205 --> 00:05:16.555\npersonally identifiable information and\ndata management.\n\n98\n00:05:16.555 --> 00:05:19.807\nI know that Daniel's been hard at\nwork creating some definitions for\n\n99\n00:05:19.807 --> 00:05:21.607\nus, and has put in the time.\n\n100\n00:05:21.607 --> 00:05:24.617\nMy god look at that, the time and\neffort has yielded results.\n\n101\n00:05:24.617 --> 00:05:27.427\nOutstanding, and\nwhat a great color choice as well.\n\n102\n00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:30.480\nSpring colors going into\nthe new spring season.\n\n103\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.350\nSo black is now the new yellow I guess.\n\n104\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.850\nYellow is the color of the day.\n\n105\n00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.610\nSo we do see on the left hand side\na list of roles that we want to define\n\n106\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.590\non the right, we do have definitions.\n\n107\n00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.490\nWanna go through these things with you\nto make sure you understand what roles\n\n108\n00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.170\nare gonna be important here.\n\n109\n00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.570\nAnd as a result, what we can then expect\nand or scribe as responsibility and\n\n110\n00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.760\naccountability to these roles.\n\n111\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.550\nSo are you gonna help\nme walk through this?\n\n112\n00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.570\n>> Sure.\n\n113\n00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.500\n>> Okay.\nI just wanted to check.\n\n114\n00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.630\n>> Yeah.\n>> I was just curious.\n\n115\n00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:57.350\n>> I'm your wingman.\n\n116\n00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.620\nYou just tell me what you\nneed on there for you.\n\n117\n00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.830\nYou're the goose.\n\n118\n00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.190\n>> Okay I got it.\n\n119\n00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.860\nUnderstood.\n\n120\n00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.230\nSo if I do need you, we need a signal,\nwe need a hand signal.\n\n121\n00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.740\n>> That's right.\n\n122\n00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.830\n>> Should I do this?\n\n123\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.535\n>> Yeah.\n>> That's good or should I do this?\n\n124\n00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:10.420\n[LAUGH]\n>> Or\n\n125\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.370\nmaybe I could do this, a little hand turn.\n\n126\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.990\n>> Something.\n\n127\n00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.110\nWe'll come up with a signal.\n\n128\n00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.650\nAll right, so,\nyou're gonna help me walk through these.\n\n129\n00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.370\nSo, let's talk a little bit about\ndata subjects, first of all.\n\n130\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.450\nWhen we talk about data subjects,\nin general,\n\n131\n00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.110\nwe talk about the subject generically,\nin access control.\n\n132\n00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.230\nAnd this is really where we see this\ninformation, this thought process,\n\n133\n00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.380\nthis terminology first emerge.\n\n134\n00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.080\nWe see subject and object and\nwe talk about subjects and\n\n135\n00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.470\nobjects in access control with\nregards to users and data.\n\n136\n00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.680\nUsers and the things that proxy\non their behalf are subjects and\n\n137\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.280\nthe data that they focus on\nis going to be the object.\n\n138\n00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.590\nSo a data subject is an individual\nwho is the subject of personal data.\n\n139\n00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.390\nIn other words,\nthe data subject essentially is the person\n\n140\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:56.730\nwho the PII is being created to represent,\nor who the pi does represent.\n\n141\n00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.610\nSo the personally identifiable information\nis unique to the individual data subject\n\n142\n00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.500\nin question.\n\n143\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.150\nIf Daniel you were the data subject in\nour conversation then the personally\n\n144\n00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.890\nidentifiable information we would\ntalk about with regards to you.\n\n145\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.020\nYou would be linked to you, you would be\nthe data subject in other words right.\n\n146\n00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.690\nBe the data subject Daniel,\nbe the data subject.\n\n147\n00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.780\n>> So this is who the actual\ndata is referencing.\n\n148\n00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.040\n>> Who the data is referencing,\n\n149\n00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.250\nnot the actual data just the data well\nthe personally identifiable information\n\n150\n00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.720\ndata cuz we don't have un-actual\ndata we only have actual data.\n\n151\n00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.140\nSo the data controller right\nthe data controller next term down\n\n152\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.140\nwanna highlight that one.\n\n153\n00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.900\n>> Sure, yeah.\n>> Okay.\n\n154\n00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.260\nJust so we know what we're talking about.\n\n155\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.000\nSo the data controller,\nthank you very much.\n\n156\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.630\nSo the data controller is gonna be,\nas you see there, the person or the role.\n\n157\n00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.820\nRemember, it's not\nnecessarily Sam all the time.\n\n158\n00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.970\nIt's whoever inhabits the role of the data\ncontroller that we would refer to.\n\n159\n00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.520\nBut it's gonna be the designated role,\nright, in the organization.\n\n160\n00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.867\nSo when we say the person we mean whoever\ninhabits that role, just to be clear.\n\n161\n00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:57.486\nSo the person who ultimately\ndetermines the process for which and\n\n162\n00:07:57.486 --> 00:08:01.102\nthe mater in which or by which any\npersonal data meaning any kind of\n\n163\n00:08:01.102 --> 00:08:03.431\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n164\n00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:07.694\nAre going to be used or\nsomehow processed in some way.\n\n165\n00:08:07.694 --> 00:08:11.542\nSo the controller essentially is\ngoing to set up the expectations and\n\n166\n00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:16.385\nthe rules that govern the way data will be\nprocessed, the way personally identifiable\n\n167\n00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:20.380\ninformation will be handled and\nprocessed in the organization.\n\n168\n00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.660\nSo the data controller's\na very important role.\n\n169\n00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.050\nThey have oversight accountability and\nultimately oversight responsibility for\n\n170\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.170\nensuring that the data processing\nstandards are well defined and\n\n171\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.710\nultimately are gonna be seeing over,\noverseeing the enforcement of them.\n\n172\n00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.000\nThey will delegate ultimately\ndown the day to day,\n\n173\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.871\nmoment to moment use of those standards.\n\n174\n00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:41.268\nBut they have to stand above them and\n\n175\n00:08:41.268 --> 00:08:43.325\nensure they're being\nhandled the right way.\n\n176\n00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:46.625\n>> So this is who's selling my\ndata to like mailing lists and\n\n177\n00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:47.565\nthings of that nature?\n\n178\n00:08:47.565 --> 00:08:49.805\n>> No, no, no, not at all,\nnot necessarily.\n\n179\n00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:53.065\nThis is the role that is going to decide\n\n180\n00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.625\nunder what conditions we may\nbe able to sell that data.\n\n181\n00:08:56.625 --> 00:09:00.235\nAnd if we do decide to sell the data,\nwhat the controls, the processes,\n\n182\n00:09:00.235 --> 00:09:04.670\nprotections would have to be that would\nensure that that data is handled securely.\n\n183\n00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:08.070\nBut they're not actually executing,\nlet's say, a data swap or a sale or\n\n184\n00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.950\nanything like that.\n\n185\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.390\nThey are the ones,\nif we think about a policy perspective,\n\n186\n00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.000\nthey're the ones that actually\nare drafting the policy that are gonna\n\n187\n00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.610\nstipulate how data can be\nused under what conditions.\n\n188\n00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.460\nBut they're not gonna be\nthe ones that pull the trigger.\n\n189\n00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.951\n>> Okay,\n[CROSSTALK] it's an important distinction.\n\n190\n00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:27.294\n>> If you're on a mailing list, if they're\nnot, then probably doesn't matter to you,\n\n191\n00:09:27.294 --> 00:09:30.923\nbut yes it does certainly matter and\nit is a very important distinction,\n\n192\n00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:31.900\nno doubt about it.\n\n193\n00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.900\nWe have the data processor, our next\nterminology item down, next row down.\n\n194\n00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.040\nThe data processor, again, any person\nthere, so whoever is in this role, right,\n\n195\n00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.700\nis going to be the person who processes\nthe data on behalf of the data controller.\n\n196\n00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.820\nSo you were talking about hey,\nis this the role?\n\n197\n00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:48.850\nIs this the person that sells my data?\n\n198\n00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.190\nAnd I said no, it's the role, the person\nthat oversees the thought process behind\n\n199\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.420\nwhat would be acceptable to do if\nwe did decide to sell the data.\n\n200\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:56.572\nUnder what conditions?\n\n201\n00:09:56.572 --> 00:10:00.025\nThe data processor is the one that\nactually processes the data and\n\n202\n00:10:00.025 --> 00:10:03.125\ninteracts with it based on\nthe stipulations, based on the box,\n\n203\n00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:06.855\nessentially, and the regulations\nthat the data controller lays down.\n\n204\n00:10:06.855 --> 00:10:09.215\nSo they're the ones that may pull\nthe trigger, they're the ones that,\n\n205\n00:10:09.215 --> 00:10:11.445\nin theory, will be working with the data.\n\n206\n00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:14.379\nBut they do so only under the conditions\nstipulated by the data controller.\n\n207\n00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.060\nSo, important for us to be aware of that.\n\n208\n00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.440\nData stewards are next, and\na data steward is responsible for\n\n209\n00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.330\ndata content, data context, and\nthe associated business rules that\n\n210\n00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:29.980\nare going to be used in the relationship\nof using that data with other data.\n\n211\n00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:36.250\nSo the data stewards are going to\nultimately make sure that we have not\n\n212\n00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:42.530\nonly integrity because integrity\nis part of this, the context,\n\n213\n00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:48.210\nthe content, the content would speak to\nintegrity, but also that we are able to\n\n214\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:52.550\napply the rules that the data controller\nhas stipulated in the appropriate\n\n215\n00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.850\nways to achieve the desired outcomes that\nthe controller had said they would like.\n\n216\n00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.750\nSo the controller says A, B,\nand C must be implemented.\n\n217\n00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.630\nThe steward ensures A, B,\nand C are implemented.\n\n218\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.010\nThe processor uses the data\nwith reference to A, B, and\n\n219\n00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.280\nC in the system that the steward and\nthe controller have jointly built.\n\n220\n00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.930\n>> Okay.\n>> Or have jointly structured if you want\n\n221\n00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.450\nto think of it that way.\n\n222\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.590\nAnd then the data custodian,\ncoming down one more row,\n\n223\n00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.640\nthe data custodian responsible for\nsafe custody, safe transport,\n\n224\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.250\nsafe storage of the data, and\nimplementation of business rules.\n\n225\n00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:33.670\nSo the custodian is responsible for\nintegrity, certainly, as the steward is.\n\n226\n00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.300\nThey oversee the data, so they have\nto ensure the viability of it, but\n\n227\n00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.470\nalso confidentiality and availability.\n\n228\n00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.600\nSo the data custodian essentially\nhas to represent all three aspects\n\n229\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.810\nof the information security pillars\nthat we talked about because\n\n230\n00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:51.090\nthey have to ensure while we're owning,\nor modifying, or\n\n231\n00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.400\nusing the data while removing it,\nor transporting it, or storing it.\n\n232\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.430\nSo data on the wire, data at rest,\ndata in use, that we are implementing\n\n233\n00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.285\nthe appropriate business rules and all\nof the controls that the controller and\n\n234\n00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:07.330\nthe stewardess had set are going to\nbe important for us to abide by.\n\n235\n00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.590\nSo the data custodian is gonna inhabit\nthat role, and then the data owner, or\n\n236\n00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.650\ndata ownership, you can think of\nit either way, but the owner role,\n\n237\n00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.960\nwhatever that is, this ultimately,\nand this is an important distinction\n\n238\n00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:23.960\nbecause people often confuse the\ncontroller and the owner in this regard.\n\n239\n00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.600\nThe data owner holds legal rights and\ncomplete control\n\n240\n00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.020\nover a single piece of data or a set\nof data elements, whatever it may be.\n\n241\n00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.960\nSo the data owner is\nthe final voice of authority.\n\n242\n00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.900\nThe data owner essentially is,\nas President Truman once said, right,\n\n243\n00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.820\nthe buck stops here, said essentially\nthat I am ultimately accountable,\n\n244\n00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.500\nright, for what happens as the leader,\nin this case,\n\n245\n00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.710\nas the President of\nthe United States as he was.\n\n246\n00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:53.000\nThe data owner is ultimately accountable\nfor the data legally, right?\n\n247\n00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.180\nThey are the ones who\nare the owner of record.\n\n248\n00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.050\nThey are responsible for that data.\n\n249\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.510\nThey ultimately bear the issues,\nthe concerns, the liabilities, and\n\n250\n00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.380\nif there is a penalty, if there is\na problem, it lands on their door step.\n\n251\n00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:11.200\nEverybody else operates underneath the\ndata owner, meaning the data owner, right,\n\n252\n00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.930\nis going to be the role that, when I\ncreate data, we often say creator, owner.\n\n253\n00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:19.459\nWhen I am the data owner, I have created\nthe data, or somehow it's passed to me\n\n254\n00:13:19.459 --> 00:13:22.507\nthrough somebody else creating them and\nsaying, now it's yours,\n\n255\n00:13:22.507 --> 00:13:26.217\ncuz maybe I've modified it, so it now\nbecomes derivative product, it's mine.\n\n256\n00:13:26.217 --> 00:13:30.514\nI ultimately get to decide what is done\nwith that data, I classify data, remember,\n\n257\n00:13:30.514 --> 00:13:32.937\ndata ownership implies\ndata classification,\n\n258\n00:13:32.937 --> 00:13:35.120\nresponsibility and capabilities.\n\n259\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.710\nOnce I do that, the controller,\nthe processor, the steward and\n\n260\n00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:45.860\nthe custodian take their cues from me and\nultimately implement, build, and operate\n\n261\n00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:51.320\nsystems designed to support my vision\nof what the data should be able to do.\n\n262\n00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.570\n>> Speaking to the idea of data ownership,\n\n263\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:58.030\nyou mentioned before that, I think you\nsaid in Europe, they had a law and\n\n264\n00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:03.560\nactivist said, if you have data about me\non your systems, I can have you erase it.\n\n265\n00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.160\nDoes that make the individual themselves\nthat it references the owner of the data?\n\n266\n00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.470\nWell, there's no disputing\nthe fact that with regards to Pi,\n\n267\n00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.430\nthe individual that the data\npoints to is considered the owner.\n\n268\n00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:16.780\nThat's really not in question.\n\n269\n00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.620\n>> Even if they didn't create it?\n\n270\n00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:20.690\n>> Well,\nit's not that they didn't create it or\n\n271\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:24.020\nthey did because the reality is we\nare the ones who the data points to.\n\n272\n00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.790\nWe are the possessor in a sense of that\nunique set of attributes that are being\n\n273\n00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:28.650\nreferenced in the data.\n\n274\n00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.440\nSo when you talk about my Social Security\nnumber, let's say hypothetically,\n\n275\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.390\nright, as a United States citizen,\nwho would have a Social Security number.\n\n276\n00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.910\nWhen you talk about mine, right,\n1234567890, and before you ask, no,\n\n277\n00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.990\nthat is not really my\nSocial Security number.\n\n278\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.130\nI'm not that silly right, and\nso if that is the number, and\n\n279\n00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:52.530\nit is essentially been given to me by\nthe United States federal government and\n\n280\n00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.380\nby the state that I was born in and\nessentially registered.\n\n281\n00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.360\nAnd said between the two,\nthat should uniquely identify\n\n282\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.420\nthis person throughout their life,\nunless we make some sort of change.\n\n283\n00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.000\nI am, essentially, the owner of that data,\nright, it is mine.\n\n284\n00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.270\nI give it out at my desire or\nmy discretion.\n\n285\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.930\nI can give it to you, I can not.\n\n286\n00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:14.630\nI can decide that I'm gonna give it\nto a certain entity to use or not.\n\n287\n00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.180\nSo, when I give it to them, as the owner,\nI'm allowing them to do something with it.\n\n288\n00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:23.394\nThe data custodian, the data steward,\nthe data controller,\n\n289\n00:15:23.394 --> 00:15:27.370\nthe data processor,\nthese are all roles that would exist in\n\n290\n00:15:27.370 --> 00:15:31.845\nan organization that will get\nthe data from me as the data subject.\n\n291\n00:15:31.845 --> 00:15:35.850\nCuz remember, the data subject is\nthe person the data refers to.\n\n292\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:39.909\nIn the case of personally identifiable\ninformation, I am both the data subject\n\n293\n00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:43.071\nand the data owner because the data\nis mine and it refers to me.\n\n294\n00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:45.159\nI can then give it to an entity, and\n\n295\n00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:50.127\nthen they can decide to operate within\nthe rules and the process, the procedure,\n\n296\n00:15:50.127 --> 00:15:55.095\nthe policies, the regulatory compliance,\nthe government's oversight that is\n\n297\n00:15:55.095 --> 00:15:59.991\nstipulated by these various roles built\ninto these various systems to align with\n\n298\n00:15:59.991 --> 00:16:03.537\nwhatever laws, regulations,\nrequirements may exist.\n\n299\n00:16:03.537 --> 00:16:06.539\nSo we may reference the OECD\nprivacy principles, right?\n\n300\n00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:10.344\nWe may reference Directive 9546.\n\n301\n00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:15.260\nWe may reference COBIT, the governance,\nthe IT governance framework.\n\n302\n00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:18.040\nWe may reference a variety\nof different things.\n\n303\n00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.750\nThose rules, those regulatory concerns,\nwill be interpreted into\n\n304\n00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.680\nthe system by all the roles we have been\ntalking about and then implementing.\n\n305\n00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.050\nBut I am the subject and\n\n306\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.360\nI am also the owner of that\ndata in the sense it is mine.\n\n307\n00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.210\nNow the reality is I don't own\nit when it's in your system.\n\n308\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.550\nRight, I mean it is still\ngoing to be jointly shared.\n\n309\n00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.600\nYou're going to be using it and\ntherefore managing it on my behalf.\n\n310\n00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.880\nBut the right to be forgotten law really\nis built on this idea that as the data\n\n311\n00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.300\nsubject, as the ultimate owner of that\ndata, I have the right to claim it and\n\n312\n00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.510\ntell you I want it removed.\n\n313\n00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.160\nI can essentially call it back.\n\n314\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.820\n>> I assume that only stipulates to\nthe private sector and not the government.\n\n315\n00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.342\nIf you were arrested and you had a-\n>> You can't claim civil rights.\n\n316\n00:17:00.342 --> 00:17:01.003\n>> Right.\n\n317\n00:17:01.003 --> 00:17:02.420\n>> So you can't go in and say, hey,\n\n318\n00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.200\nremove that arrest record because I don't\nwant to be known as that person anymore.\n\n319\n00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.420\nNo, you can't do that.\n\n320\n00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.810\nBut if it was fraudulently produced data\nin other words you were found not guilty\n\n321\n00:17:11.810 --> 00:17:15.260\nbecause you were framed or something like\nthat, that data should be expunged and\n\n322\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.060\nyou have the right to request that\nindeed to make sure that happens and\n\n323\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.150\nnot just in Europe by the way,\nin that very specifically defined case.\n\n324\n00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:26.130\nBut in most legal systems around the world\nyou have the right if proven innocent of\n\n325\n00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.850\na charge to have any\nreference to that removed.\n\n326\n00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.090\nAnd it's no longer supposed\nto be associated with you.\n\n327\n00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:34.840\nNow whether that actually happens or\nnot is a process issue.\n\n328\n00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.270\nIt has nothing to do with the fact that\nthe law says that that should be the case.\n\n329\n00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:40.780\nIt's just a matter of making\nsure it's done the right way.\n\n330\n00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.470\nYears ago, right when technology was\npretty straightforward, you had a piece of\n\n331\n00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.510\npaper and it had a bunch of stuff\non it and you tore up the file and\n\n332\n00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.340\nsaid, okay you're no longer\nconsidered guilty, you're innocent.\n\n333\n00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.240\nNobody thought about it anymore.\n\n334\n00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.450\nToday because everything is digital and\nit's in a million different places,\n\n335\n00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.440\nit's a lot harder to make\nsure we remove all that data.\n\n336\n00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.850\nBut there's still a burden under\nthe law in most legal systems\n\n337\n00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:04.710\nthat if you're proven innocent,\nreferences to that and\n\n338\n00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.600\nthe fact that you are not\nshould be removed.\n\n339\n00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.240\nBut that has nothing to\ndo per se with this.\n\n340\n00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.280\nThat's been around even before\nany of this conversation.\n\n341\n00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.284\nBut what we're talking about really\nis in a consumer relationship,\n\n342\n00:18:15.284 --> 00:18:17.784\nwhich is really what the right\nto be forgotten was about.\n\n343\n00:18:17.784 --> 00:18:21.593\nIn social media relationships, where you\ngive your information to Facebook, or\n\n344\n00:18:21.593 --> 00:18:25.639\nI don't know, what's another popular site\nthat all the kids are going to these days?\n\n345\n00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:26.456\n>> Twitter?\n\n346\n00:18:26.456 --> 00:18:27.880\n>> Twitter, or you know whatever it is.\n\n347\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.930\nI don't use any of these things so\nI have no way of knowing what they are.\n\n348\n00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.764\nI hear about them, right, but I don't\nactually use them on a regular basis.\n\n349\n00:18:33.764 --> 00:18:38.302\nBut certainly Facebook, Twitter,\nMySpace which is an oldie,\n\n350\n00:18:38.302 --> 00:18:40.831\nprobably not even around anymore.\n\n351\n00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:42.655\nShows how long it's been since\nI've been on social media.\n\n352\n00:18:42.655 --> 00:18:43.803\n>> It's actually still is around.\n\n353\n00:18:43.803 --> 00:18:44.454\n>> It is?\n\n354\n00:18:44.454 --> 00:18:46.140\n>> Yes.\n>> Is that where all the bronies or\n\n355\n00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.610\nwhatever the heck you told me they were.\n\n356\n00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.630\n>> It's no, it's bronies.\n\n357\n00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.261\nIt seems to be more musically inclined.\n\n358\n00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:51.160\n>> Okay all right.\n\n359\n00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.470\nMySpace, whatever it is.\n\n360\n00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.110\nAny social media sites you're on, right?\n\n361\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.050\nWhatever it may be.\n\n362\n00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.160\nYou have the right, for instance,\nto go to Facebook and say, hey,\n\n363\n00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.460\nI want my profile pulled.\n\n364\n00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.500\nI wanna get rid of it and\n\n365\n00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.490\nI want all that information about\nme removed from your system.\n\n366\n00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.710\nSo that way you're not\ncollateral marketing to me,\n\n367\n00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.200\nyou're not cross marketing\nacross other platforms to me.\n\n368\n00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.780\nI don't wanna be a reference point\nin your data stream anymore.\n\n369\n00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:16.950\nAnd at least in Europe anyway, in the EU\nyou have the right to request that.\n\n370\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.870\nNow the vendor has to\ncomply under the stipulated\n\n371\n00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.970\nregulatory compliance issues with the law.\n\n372\n00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.340\nThey may chose to do so\nin a variety of different ways.\n\n373\n00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.770\nBut ultimately they've gotta meet that\nrequirement and they've gotta say okay,\n\n374\n00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.070\nhere's our process.\n\n375\n00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:33.240\nAnd if you follow these steps,\nyou give us this information,\n\n376\n00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.360\nwhatever we tell you we need,\nwe'll go ahead and we'll do that.\n\n377\n00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.900\nThat's not the same\neverywhere in the world but\n\n378\n00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.140\nit is the same at least right now anyway,\nit is gonna be in the DEU,\n\n379\n00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.620\nmay at some point change.\n\n380\n00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.120\nWe may or may not see that\npropagate up beyond there.\n\n381\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.580\nBut that's where it's been at least for\nthe last amount of time anyway.\n\n382\n00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.520\nSo, you'll count of instinct right.\n\n383\n00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:54.590\nSo we do wanna understand, do wanna make\nsure we know what those our roles are.\n\n384\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.350\nCan be very important to you as a CCSP\nto understand what those roles are.\n\n385\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.890\nMake sure you can reproduce\nthat knowledge if asked.\n\n386\n00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.240\nMake sure you understand how to apply\nthe thought processes behind those roles\n\n387\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.825\nto ensure that you can talk\nknowledgeably about, or think about and\n\n388\n00:20:08.825 --> 00:20:11.780\ntherefore distill information and\nanswer questions about those roles and\n\n389\n00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.040\nhow they would interact.\n\n390\n00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.580\nAnd like the dialogue that Dave and\n\n391\n00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:19.080\nI were just having, with regards to hey am\nI the owner, am I the subject, am I both?\n\n392\n00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.020\nWhat does that mean?\n\n393\n00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.020\nHow does that work?\n\n394\n00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.580\nYou gotta make sure you have a sense of\nthat with regards to cloud based data.\n\n395\n00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.990\nCorporations, organizational\nidentities have to understand and\n\n396\n00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:31.510\nidentify these roles even if they\ndon't choose to populate all of them.\n\n397\n00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.770\nI have many customers that populate all\nthese roles, I have many that don't.\n\n398\n00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.680\nThat roll them up and say okay,\nwe've got a data owner, clearly defined.\n\n399\n00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:40.980\nWe've got a data subject, clearly defined.\n\n400\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.460\nWe have a data custodian, or data\nprocessor, or whatever the case may be,\n\n401\n00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.570\nbut that's kind of a role that does a lot\nof things, and may not do everything.\n\n402\n00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:51.320\nOr it may do only one thing.\n\n403\n00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:54.760\nIt depends on the organization,\nbut these are the working roles.\n\n404\n00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.940\nThe standard language we use with\nregards to talking about data,\n\n405\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.730\nspecifically personally identifiable\ninformation in the cloud today.\n\n406\n00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.100\nAnd you need to understand them and\nbe able to deal with what that is.\n\n407\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.540\nWe've talked a lot about Pi.\n\n408\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.125\nI made reference at least in one or\nmore episodes.\n\n409\n00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:14.855\nThe last episode especially\nto the fact that as the CCSP,\n\n410\n00:21:14.855 --> 00:21:16.625\nyou have to negotiate and\nknow up front and\n\n411\n00:21:16.625 --> 00:21:20.065\nbe smart enough to negotiate around\nthese issues, these concerns.\n\n412\n00:21:20.065 --> 00:21:24.698\nWith regards to, we were talking about\ncloud forensics in the last episode and\n\n413\n00:21:24.698 --> 00:21:29.890\ntalking about how we can manage data,\ndoing discovery, the 27037 ISO standard,\n\n414\n00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:33.772\nwhat that may help us understand\nhow to do forensics in the cloud.\n\n415\n00:21:33.772 --> 00:21:37.296\nWe were talking about the fact that\nthe CCSP has to negotiate up-front,\n\n416\n00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:40.877\ninto their hosting agreements,\nin their SLAs etc, the right to have this\n\n417\n00:21:40.877 --> 00:21:44.896\ncapability and to understand what the\nvendor, the cloud provider, will offer.\n\n418\n00:21:44.896 --> 00:21:48.344\nSo that you're not trying to guess at this\nin the middle of actually being told to\n\n419\n00:21:48.344 --> 00:21:49.018\nproduce data.\n\n420\n00:21:49.018 --> 00:21:53.079\nSo we talked about the need to be looking\nahead and really be proactive, and\n\n421\n00:21:53.079 --> 00:21:54.760\nthat applies here as well.\n\n422\n00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.300\nWith regards to personally identifiable\ninformation where an organization or\n\n423\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.040\nentity is gonna either process,\ntransmit, or\n\n424\n00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.600\nin any way touch pi as part of the data\nstreams that they are going to deal with.\n\n425\n00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.530\nThey have to adequately protect this data.\n\n426\n00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:12.490\nThey have to understand, meaning you as\na CCSP, have to adequately protect and\n\n427\n00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.650\nunderstand the protection\nlevel required for\n\n428\n00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:17.760\nthis data in the geographies\nthat you do business in.\n\n429\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:22.420\nIf you're doing business in an area where\nthere are national, there are federal,\n\n430\n00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.960\nthere are local, there are states,\nthere are municipality based laws.\n\n431\n00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.790\nYou have to understand all those\nmunicipal, or excuse me, all those\n\n432\n00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:32.670\ncompetitive layers and there may be\ntreaties involved that are extranational\n\n433\n00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.950\nbetween countries that may govern\nthe regulatory compliance of this data.\n\n434\n00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.210\nYou have to understand that.\n\n435\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.945\nSomething like a safe harbor provision is\ngonna override whatever other laws are in\n\n436\n00:22:41.945 --> 00:22:45.675\nplace in the state that you\noperate in in the United States.\n\n437\n00:22:45.675 --> 00:22:48.285\nAnd the municipality you operate\nin in the United States.\n\n438\n00:22:48.285 --> 00:22:50.295\nAt the federal level in the United States.\n\n439\n00:22:50.295 --> 00:22:54.202\nThat Safe Harbor provision is gonna\ntrump all of those other laws.\n\n440\n00:22:54.202 --> 00:22:57.652\nAnd you're going to then as a result\nhave to follow whatever Safe Harbor or\n\n441\n00:22:57.652 --> 00:23:00.652\nPrivacy Shield, or whatever it will\nbe called in the future, will be.\n\n442\n00:23:00.652 --> 00:23:05.453\nAnd you have to adhere to those regulatory\nconcerns and those compliance requirements\n\n443\n00:23:05.453 --> 00:23:09.461\nif you're doing business with,\nlet's say, an EU member country and or\n\n444\n00:23:09.461 --> 00:23:13.227\na national of an EU member country\nin order to safeguard their data.\n\n445\n00:23:13.227 --> 00:23:16.315\nYou're going to have to comply, in other\nwords, at the extranational level.\n\n446\n00:23:16.315 --> 00:23:19.906\nThe level that is at a negotiated\ntreaty so we do have to understand,\n\n447\n00:23:19.906 --> 00:23:24.191\ncontracts should list out and stipulate\nwhat protection requirements pi will be\n\n448\n00:23:24.191 --> 00:23:27.540\nafforded based on how you're\ngonna interact with that.\n\n449\n00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.070\nAppropriate levels of confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability should be\n\n450\n00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.170\nlisted and should be discussed and\nshould be committed to in the contract.\n\n451\n00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:38.230\nWe tend to have mandatory\nbreach requirements as well\n\n452\n00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:43.080\nwhere I think at last count 47\nstates in the United States have\n\n453\n00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.230\nmandatory breach requirements as\nof some time in mid to late 2015.\n\n454\n00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.647\nGoing into 2016 that number\nmay change in the future.\n\n455\n00:23:50.647 --> 00:23:53.335\nBut last time I checked,\nit was roughly 47 states that\n\n456\n00:23:53.335 --> 00:23:56.996\nhave mandatory breach requirements or\nbreach reporting requirements, so\n\n457\n00:23:56.996 --> 00:24:00.329\nthat, if something happens,\nyou as a customer have to be notified.\n\n458\n00:24:00.329 --> 00:24:03.051\nI don't know if you've ever\nreceived one of those.\n\n459\n00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:07.115\nLetters from the bankers or\nsomething, or a company.\n\n460\n00:24:07.115 --> 00:24:10.400\nHey, we've had this issue, and we're\nnotifying you you may have been involved\n\n461\n00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.050\nin this breach,\nhere's what we're doing to deal with it.\n\n462\n00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.795\nHere's your new credit card, here's your\nnew account number, whatever it may be.\n\n463\n00:24:16.795 --> 00:24:18.075\nIt's not just states, by the way.\n\n464\n00:24:18.075 --> 00:24:20.385\nIt's also territories\nwithin the United States.\n\n465\n00:24:20.385 --> 00:24:24.205\nSo, Puerto Rico, District of Columbia,\nthe Virgin Islands all\n\n466\n00:24:24.205 --> 00:24:27.725\nhave breach reporting requirements\nas well as many of the states.\n\n467\n00:24:27.725 --> 00:24:30.145\nAnd so I wanna clarify and\nmake sure that you know that.\n\n468\n00:24:30.145 --> 00:24:34.275\n>> The Target credit card breach actually\nmade me have to get a whole new,\n\n469\n00:24:34.275 --> 00:24:36.365\nnot a credit card, it was my debit card.\n\n470\n00:24:36.365 --> 00:24:38.225\nBut the bank sent me, said yep,\n\n471\n00:24:38.225 --> 00:24:40.820\nyou were part of those people\nthat might be compromised.\n\n472\n00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.100\nHere's a whole new set of credentials.\n\n473\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.790\n>> Yep and it's not necessarily\njust big companies, right?\n\n474\n00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:51.510\nSmall companies, companies of any size,\nif they have a breach have to comply.\n\n475\n00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:55.860\nThere's really no issue and we say you're\na 1,000 user company you comply and\n\n476\n00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.490\nyou're a 5 user company you may or\nmay not have to comply.\n\n477\n00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.100\nThe law is pretty\neven-handed in this respect.\n\n478\n00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:05.010\nIf there's a breach of a certain level\nthen you have to notify the customers,\n\n479\n00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.685\nregardless of what you're doing.\n\n480\n00:25:06.685 --> 00:25:11.360\nSo just be aware of the fact that\nthere are many intricacies, many laws,\n\n481\n00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.320\nmany stipulations,\n\n482\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.840\nmany regulatory concerns that we as\nCCSPs would have to be aware of.\n\n483\n00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.970\nI would not spend a lot of time, if I was\nyou, knowing that there are 47 states and\n\n484\n00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:25.800\nterritories in the US that have mandatory\nbreach reporting laws to become a CCSP.\n\n485\n00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:29.540\nBut I would know once I become one that\nif I operate in any of those areas\n\n486\n00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.950\nthat I may have to pay attention to\nwhat that breach reporting law says or\n\n487\n00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.360\nthat requirement says.\n\n488\n00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.090\nAnd if my company does suffer a breach,\n\n489\n00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:40.640\nI will probably have to take some action\nin order to notify our customers and\n\n490\n00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.130\nmaybe stakeholders,\nif we're a publicly held company.\n\n491\n00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.150\nAnd a bunch of other things along the way.\n\n492\n00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:46.990\nSo we just have to understand that.\n\n493\n00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.530\nContractual components in other words,\nneed to be very clearly documented,\n\n494\n00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:53.200\nthey need to speak to\nseveral very specific things.\n\n495\n00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.350\nThe scope of processing,\nthe use of subcontractors, removal and or\n\n496\n00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.410\ndeletion of data, so\n\n497\n00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.640\nthis idea of right to be forgotten that\nwe were talking about for instance,\n\n498\n00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.420\nappropriate end, or required data\nsecurity controls should be addressed.\n\n499\n00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.640\nLocation, or locations of the data, so\ngeo-preference for hosting, for instance,\n\n500\n00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.630\nwould be something in a contract\nI've spoken about many times.\n\n501\n00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.270\nYou'd wanna know of return of data and,\nor restitution of data.\n\n502\n00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:18.270\nHow do we get the data\nback from the vendor?\n\n503\n00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:22.950\nWe took a look, remember, at the top ten\nfact list from Microsoft on Office 365 and\n\n504\n00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.860\nI pointed out that all of this\nstuff is actually there and\n\n505\n00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.670\nthat they stipulate all of this right.\n\n506\n00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.936\nAnd also as I told you audit rights and or\n\n507\n00:26:29.936 --> 00:26:34.300\nright to audit sub-contractors should\nalso be included in the contracts,\n\n508\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.360\nin other words in the hosting agreements,\nin the SLAs, in the agreements you sign or\n\n509\n00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:41.170\nwill go out and\nultimately sign with a cloud vendor.\n\n510\n00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:44.950\nOr that you put in place as the cloud\nvendor with your customers if you work for\n\n511\n00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:45.518\na provider.\n\n512\n00:26:45.518 --> 00:26:49.310\nCuz remember, CCSPs may work for\na customer, they may also work for\n\n513\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.220\na provider.\n\n514\n00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.800\nAnd your provider is ultimately going to\nhave to deal with these issues as well,\n\n515\n00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.298\nbut from a different perspective.\n\n516\n00:26:56.298 --> 00:26:59.140\nSo regardless of where you land,\nyou have to understand and\n\n517\n00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:01.180\nknow what the responsibilities are.\n\n518\n00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.780\nWe do have varying protections and\n\n519\n00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.110\nvarying laws by country as we\nhave made very clear to you.\n\n520\n00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:08.870\nThere are many,\nmany different ways to interpret this.\n\n521\n00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:13.300\nI would not get sucked into,\nif I was you, country-specific examples.\n\n522\n00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.330\nRemember, tests like the CCSP from\nISC-Squared are vendor agnostic,\n\n523\n00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:22.410\nare country agnostic, we're not looking at\na specific instance in a specific country\n\n524\n00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.800\nin many, not in all cases,\nbut in many cases.\n\n525\n00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:31.910\nSo for instance you probably would need to\nunderstand the ability of a CCSP to comply\n\n526\n00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.950\nwith a certain law if it was explained to\nyou in a word problem, at a broad level.\n\n527\n00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:38.350\nSo if we said to you,\nhey you're in country X,\n\n528\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.690\ncountry X says this is what you do,\nhow would the data controller respond?\n\n529\n00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.070\nGiven this framework, you should be\nprepared to make that determination.\n\n530\n00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.930\nBut you should be given information\nthat would help you to do so.\n\n531\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:53.890\nWe're not gonna say to you most likely,\nin Ireland, Ireland says this.\n\n532\n00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:54.820\nWhat does this mean?\n\n533\n00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.260\nBecause it's very specific\njust to one country.\n\n534\n00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.716\nAnd we're talking about\nvery broad application and\n\n535\n00:27:59.716 --> 00:28:01.400\nunderstanding of these concerns.\n\n536\n00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.760\nSo, we would think about\nknowledge of the ISO standard,\n\n537\n00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.110\nlike 27,037 for\ndigital forensics as being important.\n\n538\n00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:13.280\nBut how you would apply that by country\nwould be irrelevant to you in this exam\n\n539\n00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.380\ncuz this is not an exam about\na certain country's laws.\n\n540\n00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.880\nIt's an exam about the concepts\nof cloud security,\n\n541\n00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.920\nif that helps to make sense, right?\n\n542\n00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:25.340\nSo think about that, we have talked about\nsomething like Safe Harbor which would\n\n543\n00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:29.730\ncertainly be broad and would be at least\nan agreement between two countries.\n\n544\n00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.390\nSo it is specific, but it's a broad\nconcept even though I've referenced it\n\n545\n00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:38.290\nspecifically with regards to the United\nStates and the European Union making\n\n546\n00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:41.240\nan agreement to be able to figure\nhow to do business together.\n\n547\n00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.210\nBut the US and the European Union\nare not the only ones that\n\n548\n00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.220\nhave a Safe Harbor provision in place.\n\n549\n00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.270\nThere are Safe Harbor provisions among\nseveral different groups or countries,\n\n550\n00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.500\nthis is just the one that we often most\nwill think about it and hear about.\n\n551\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.960\nSo you wanna just be aware of that, but\n\n552\n00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:59.090\nSafe Harbor concepts in general\nare built around seven key principles.\n\n553\n00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.480\nWe wanna know what these are,\nthese are important.\n\n554\n00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.780\nAny time we have a numbered list,\nany time we have a process flow,\n\n555\n00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.980\nany time we have a set of prioritized\nactivities, you need to know them.\n\n556\n00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.440\nYou need to know them in order.\n\n557\n00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.870\nUnderstand why they are important,\nand if asked for\n\n558\n00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.460\nany reason always be able to\ntalk knowledgeably about them.\n\n559\n00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:19.270\nSo the seven key principles of\nthe Safe Harbor thought process are,\n\n560\n00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:23.810\nnotice, choice,\ntransfers to third parties,\n\n561\n00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:28.790\naccess, security,\ndata integrity, and enforcement.\n\n562\n00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.880\nLet me go through those again for you.\n\n563\n00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.910\nNotice, choice,\ntransfers to third parties, access,\n\n564\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:42.190\nsecurity, data integrity and\nenforcement right, all seven.\n\n565\n00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.940\nYou wanna make sure you understand\nthe seven guiding principles\n\n566\n00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:46.550\nof the Safe Harbor regime.\n\n567\n00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.280\nWe address all of these ideas,\nall of these concerns,\n\n568\n00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.430\nall of these areas with the negotiated\nagreement between the two parties.\n\n569\n00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:56.950\nWe've talked about the fact that Safe\nHarbor, at least between the United States\n\n570\n00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.420\nand the EU at the time of our\ndiscussions here now in the present, and\n\n571\n00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.860\nback to late 2015,\nhas kind of been turned upside down\n\n572\n00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.730\nfrom the perspective of preparing for\nan exam like this.\n\n573\n00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:10.730\nYou have to understand two things.\n\n574\n00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.990\nNumber one, the exam was written and\nproduced initially, and\n\n575\n00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:18.990\nthe questions that most likely were\nproduced initially, were written at a time\n\n576\n00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.140\nwhen Safe Harbor was still in\neffect between the US and the EU.\n\n577\n00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.940\nI'm not telling you anything that you\nshould not know because the exam questions\n\n578\n00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:28.000\nwere written prior to\nthe release of the exam.\n\n579\n00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.870\nAnd the credential went\nlive in mid to late 2015.\n\n580\n00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:37.820\nBut as a result of that you need to\nknow that that material would have\n\n581\n00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:42.360\nbeen produced initially prior to\nthe issues of the concerns that led to\n\n582\n00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:46.650\nthe effective breaking of the Safe Harbor\naccord between the US and the EU.\n\n583\n00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.530\nThe exam at some point may very\nwell be updated with new questions\n\n584\n00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.430\nthat will reflect the current state of\nthe Safe Harbor accord and the shift to\n\n585\n00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:58.870\nthis idea of Privacy Shield, but that is\nunclear as to when that would happen.\n\n586\n00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:01.720\nIt's unclear as to whether it will,\nand if it will when and\n\n587\n00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:03.250\nwhat you would need to know.\n\n588\n00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.830\nSo I would say generically\nit would be very helpful for\n\n589\n00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:10.530\nyou to be aware of what the concept of\nSafe Harbor is, the guiding principles,\n\n590\n00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:13.940\nand the reasons why we may\nnegotiate a Safe Harbor agreement.\n\n591\n00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.290\nWould I spend a lot of time\nunderstanding the specificity\n\n592\n00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.920\nof the US EU Safe Harbor agreement\nthat's no longer in force?\n\n593\n00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.080\nNo, I really wouldn't.\n\n594\n00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.810\nWhat I would do, is understand the concept\nof why we would've had a Safe Harbor\n\n595\n00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:29.660\nagreement in the first place and what\nthe guiding principles are, or would be.\n\n596\n00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:34.008\nAnd if you have those and you understand\nthose, you're gonna be well positioned to\n\n597\n00:31:34.008 --> 00:31:38.845\nanswer any kind of question, that comes up\nwith regards to a Safe Harbor alternative.\n\n598\n00:31:38.845 --> 00:31:41.665\nSo you wanna make sure you have\na sense of that and understand that.\n\n599\n00:31:41.665 --> 00:31:42.710\nIf that is helpful and\n\n600\n00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.495\nindeed gives you a point of reference,a\nlittle context if you will.\n\n601\n00:31:46.495 --> 00:31:49.410\nJust wanna make sure we are aware of\nthat and we have a sense of that also.\n\n602\n00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:53.485\n>> [SOUND] Adam, obviously we are living\nin a world where just because.\n\n603\n00:31:53.485 --> 00:31:54.309\n>> Livin la vida loca.\n\n604\n00:31:54.309 --> 00:31:56.175\n>> Yeah, we are livin la vida loca.\n\n605\n00:31:56.175 --> 00:32:02.220\nBut again, it goes back to the idea\nthat our cloud environment is global.\n\n606\n00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.810\nIt goes everywhere, and therefore we\nhave to be able to work inside of\n\n607\n00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:09.020\nthat environment, and remember that\nthere are laws that govern them,\n\n608\n00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.450\ndepending on where you are at or where\nyour data might be at, at any given time.\n\n609\n00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:16.740\nSo that being said we have to take\na close look at these things.\n\n610\n00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.730\nAnd get a good familiarization with\nthat because as you become a CCSP and\n\n611\n00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:26.230\nas Adam has pointed out, you are going to\nbe expected to be able to intelligently\n\n612\n00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.600\nspeak about these things, understand\nthe concepts and deal with them.\n\n613\n00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.970\nAnd come up with a design and a philosophy\nin your environment that is going to suit\n\n614\n00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:36.500\nwhat your business model\nis at that point in time.\n\n615\n00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.830\nAdam, we thank you so much for\n\n616\n00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.080\nexplaining these concepts to us even\nthough they can be a bit daunting.\n\n617\n00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.340\nYou have been a great and\ntremendous help for this on that.\n\n618\n00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.040\nWe do thank you guys for joining us today.\n\n619\n00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.520\nWe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n620\n00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.050\nFor ITProTV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n621\n00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:50.770\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n622\n00:32:50.770 -->

with our certified\ncloud security professional series.\n\n6\n00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.900\nJoining us back in the studio yet\n\n7\n00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.130\nagain to help lend his expertise on that\nissue is our good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.270\nAdam, welcome back to the show.\n\n9\n00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.210\nHow's it going?\n\n10\n00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.840\n>> Good.\nVery good.\n\n11\n00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.520\nBeing formal.\n\n12\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.150\n>> Always a pleasure.\n\n13\n00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.905\n>> Always a pleasure.\n\n14\n00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:35.540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Should we do the bird shake.\n\n15\n00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.420\nSo you do this.\n\n16\n00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.550\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then you do this.\n\n17\n00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.312\nNo, you do this.\n[NOISE]\n\n18\n00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:39.812\n>> I like it.\n\n19\n00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:40.312\n>> Okay, there we go.\n\n20\n00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:40.992\n>> It's a new shake.\n\n21\n00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:42.072\n>> So now that we got that out of the way.\n\n22\n00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:43.092\nIt's a new handshake here at\n\n23\n00:00:43.092 --> 00:00:44.212\nIT Pro TV.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n24\n00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:46.020\n>> So we're going to continue talking\n\n25\n00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.460\nabout legal concerns, ramifications,\n\n26\n00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.130\nissues that we have to\ncontend with as CCSPs.\n\n27\n00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.830\nWe're going to do a little but of a focus\nhere on audit and cloud audit processes.\n\n28\n00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.230\nWhat are the methodologies,\n\n29\n00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.470\nthe things that we have to be concerned\nwith regards to the cloud environment.\n\n30\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.420\nYou know when we think about audits\nwe think of the idea of either being\n\n31\n00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.380\nable internally in some cases or\nexternally in others,\n\n32\n00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.150\nor perhaps both over the course\nof a period of time.\n\n33\n00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.395\nTo examine what our expectations are and\n\n34\n00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:15.425\nsee whether what we think is happening\nis actually in truth happening.\n\n35\n00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.885\nSo we're inspecting,\n\n36\n00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:21.135\nin other words, to assess whether what\nwe've been told is the case really is.\n\n37\n00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:24.165\nAnd so when we start out from that\nperspective with regards to an audit,\n\n38\n00:01:24.165 --> 00:01:27.115\nwe have to understand that there\nare rules that we follow with regards\n\n39\n00:01:27.115 --> 00:01:27.955\nto doing audits.\n\n40\n00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:29.215\nWe have a process.\n\n41\n00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:30.205\nWe have procedures.\n\n42\n00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:31.265\nWe have thing we will or\n\n43\n00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.650\nwill not be able to do based on\nthe kind of audit we're engaging in.\n\n44\n00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.390\nBut ultimately, we're going to,\n\n45\n00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.070\nif we do this the right way,\nengage in internal audits to help us,\n\n46\n00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570\nnumber one, validate and verify,\nthe extent of our protection mechanisms.\n\n47\n00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.110\nValidate and verify that they\nare operating the way they should.\n\n48\n00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.260\nAnd then to prepare us for\n\n49\n00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.370\nan external audit, somebody who's\nimpartial, outside the organization.\n\n50\n00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.310\nWho's gonna come in,\nat least once a year typically.\n\n51\n00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.480\nAnd is then going to go through and\nprobably engage in very similar steps and\n\n52\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.070\nsimilar exercises to what\nwe've done internally.\n\n53\n00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.870\nBut as a result of doing that from an\nexternal perspective, provide an unbiased\n\n54\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.330\nand relatively accurate assessment and\naccounting of what is indeed going on.\n\n55\n00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.710\nAnd we could then take that, we could show\nthat to our customers, we could provide\n\n56\n00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.930\na letter of attestation as a result of the\noutcome of the audit if it is positive.\n\n57\n00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.260\nAnd if it is favorable to us,\nand we can show our customers,\n\n58\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.920\nif we are the cloud provider,\nthat we are meeting the obligations.\n\n59\n00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.700\nEnforcing the security requirements\nthat we are expected to do in\n\n60\n00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.280\norder to provide protections.\n\n61\n00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.460\nAnd we can then assure them,\nwith reasonableness, that their data and\n\n62\n00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.690\nindeed, all the things that they do on\nour platform, are going to be safe and\n\n63\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.030\nsecure for another year or\nwhatever the timeline is.\n\n64\n00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.830\nNow we also have to understand\nthat the audit is essentially\n\n65\n00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.820\na frozen snapshot moment in time.\n\n66\n00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.050\nAt the moment we check,\nthe results are valid.\n\n67\n00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.750\nSix months from then, the results may not\nbe valid, because things may have changed,\n\n68\n00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.870\nunless we're auditing continuously, unless\nwe have a constant validation of that.\n\n69\n00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.390\nWe only know that the moment in time we\nwere good, but that doesn't necessarily\n\n70\n00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.600\nwork into the future, nor by the way\ndoes it work backwards into the past.\n\n71\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.140\nIt is simply,\nliterally a frozen moment in time,\n\n72\n00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.410\na snapshot of the current state of\nthe governance and the compliance\n\n73\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.900\nof the organization at the moment we show\nup and essentially decide we wanna check.\n\n74\n00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.280\nBut that doesn't necessarily\nmean that it will or\n\n75\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.100\nwill not be compliant in the future.\n\n76\n00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.910\nI'm not suggesting that\nit means it won't be.\n\n77\n00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.680\nBut I'm also not promising\nthat it will be.\n\n78\n00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.760\nIs essentially what the auditor says to\nyou when they give you the audit findings.\n\n79\n00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.910\nSo we do want to be aware of that.\n\n80\n00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.500\nWe tend to use the outcomes of\nan audit as not only fodder for\n\n81\n00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.340\ncustomers in terms of attestation.\n\n82\n00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.000\nBut usually internally we\nsubmit that to our board,\n\n83\n00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.810\nif there is a board of directors or\nsenior managers or stakeholders.\n\n84\n00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.540\nDepending on the nature of the company,\nbut\n\n85\n00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.700\nthat's gonna help us to\nunderstand what we're doing.\n\n86\n00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.650\nHelps us to deal with the statements of\nadjuration around risks that a board of\n\n87\n00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.480\ndirectors may want, or that stake holders\nmay want to ensure that we're following\n\n88\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.670\nproper financial management practices,\nproper security practices.\n\n89\n00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.830\nWe are compliant with all the regulatory\nrequirements we may in our industry.\n\n90\n00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.590\nThese are all very important things,\nright, when you think about it.\n\n91\n00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.450\nSo this is the kind of thing,\nthat audits can do for us.\n\n92\n00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.470\nAnd we wanna start out our discussions,\nby understanding that.\n\n93\n00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.970\nBecause, the thing with an audit in\nthe cloud, is that we have to again,\n\n94\n00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.590\nas we've talked about in prior episodes,\nmake sure we have the right, to audit,\n\n95\n00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.630\nas a customer.\n\n96\n00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.370\nAnd if we don't have the right to\naudit built into out contracts,\n\n97\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.140\nwe may actually find, unfortunately,\nthat we're not given access, and\n\n98\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.590\ntherefore not given the ability\nto be able to audit.\n\n99\n00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.270\nAnd I'm not suggesting that we're gonna\nshow up on the doorstep of the data center\n\n100\n00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.130\nand demand from our Cloud provider that\nwe have a right to come in and audit.\n\n101\n00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.160\nThat's not how right to audit works and\n\n102\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.680\nthat's not typically what\nright to audit implies.\n\n103\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.660\nIt implies that we have the right\nto request from the Cloud provider\n\n104\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.520\nAttestation that they have done an audit,\nand then as a result of that, we could see\n\n105\n00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.480\nthe results of that at certain points\nin time over the course of a year.\n\n106\n00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.850\nBut we're not necessarily\ngonna be able to show up and\n\n107\n00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.930\nconduct an on site audit ourselves,\nthat is very unlikely.\n\n108\n00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.570\nThere are scenarios where that may occur,\nthere are scenarios where that may be\n\n109\n00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.500\nacceptable, there are scenarios where that\nmay be driven by a legal requirement.\n\n110\n00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.580\nBut those are well documented,\nthose are stipulated ahead of time and\n\n111\n00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.920\nor come up in the due course of\na investigation, or something like that.\n\n112\n00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.670\nAnd they are handled as one of exceptions\nthe standing rule in those cases with data\n\n113\n00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.070\ncenters is that you don't have a right\nto show up and audit as an individual.\n\n114\n00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.040\nCustomers certainly not as\na retail client, not working for\n\n115\n00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.290\na major business You\ncould forget about that.\n\n116\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.370\nIf you're hosting on Office\n365 as a person, and\n\n117\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.930\nyou're on Outlook.com,\nusing Hotmail or whatever,\n\n118\n00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.910\nyou have no right to go audit Microsoft\nand request that they show you anything.\n\n119\n00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.800\nFor your $10 a month they're not\ninterested in talking to you.\n\n120\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.510\nWith regards to that, you can read\nup on what they do provide, and\n\n121\n00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.170\nthe attestations of protection they offer.\n\n122\n00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.320\nAnd you can use those to assure\nyourself that you are hopefully\n\n123\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.420\nhaving the right protection\nsupplied to your data, but\n\n124\n00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.960\nthat's about the extent of your right to\nanything with regards to hosting there.\n\n125\n00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.970\nIt's only really when we talk\nabout businesses, right?\n\n126\n00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.090\nIn the enterprise space,\n\n127\n00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.000\nthat we start to really define\na right to audit beyond that.\n\n128\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.580\nNow, keep in mind that if we\nare doing private on-prem Cloud, so\n\n129\n00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.480\nwe are essentially the provider of Cloud's\nservices is IT to the business, right?\n\n130\n00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.800\nAnd everything is internal, we own it all.\n\n131\n00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.540\nThe right to audit is essentially\nthe right to examine our own system.\n\n132\n00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:27.560\nSo we certainly have a right to audit in\ncertain well-defined cases in the cloud.\n\n133\n00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.277\nBut short of on-prem private cloud,\nthat right to audit may be very,\n\n134\n00:06:31.277 --> 00:06:33.867\nvery questionable and\nmay look very different.\n\n135\n00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:38.077\nDepending on the requirements and the\npre-negotiation that we've engaged in, or\n\n136\n00:06:38.077 --> 00:06:41.115\nthe agreements that we have\na place with our cloud provider.\n\n137\n00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:42.824\nVery important to think about that.\n\n138\n00:06:42.824 --> 00:06:45.026\nAgain, planning ahead right, look ahead.\n\n139\n00:06:45.026 --> 00:06:47.430\nYou're going to sign a contract for\nat least a year,\n\n140\n00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.016\nat least 12 months typically for\n\n141\n00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:53.008\ncloud services maybe longer most companies\naren't going to really want to do business\n\n142\n00:06:53.008 --> 00:06:57.125\nwith you unless you're committing to at\nleast a 12 month run on their platform.\n\n143\n00:06:57.125 --> 00:06:59.355\nSo for the next 12 months,\nif you're gonna commit,\n\n144\n00:06:59.355 --> 00:07:02.795\nyou gotta know ahead of time that you're\ngonna need through at least one audit cuz\n\n145\n00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:06.010\nyou have a yearly standing policy\nthat says you audit every year.\n\n146\n00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.610\nYou know you've got to have at least\none during the next twelve months.\n\n147\n00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.500\nYou better make sure you work with that\ncloud vendor to stipulate that's the case,\n\n148\n00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.570\nand find out what is acceptable from\ntheir perspective, and whether or\n\n149\n00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.410\nnot your traditional third party\naudits gonna happen the same way.\n\n150\n00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.340\nOr you're going to hand an attestation\nto an auditor and say here you go.\n\n151\n00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.780\nTell us what else you want us to do,\ncause that's all you're getting.\n\n152\n00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.990\nAnd you gotta know that ahead of time.\n\n153\n00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.380\nThat's really, really critical for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n154\n00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.480\nPresent auditing methods,\nas we talked about, in the real world\n\n155\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.500\nmay not work in the cloud outside of or\nrather port it from the physical world.\n\n156\n00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.330\nI said the real world like\nthe cloud is a mythical place that\n\n157\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.210\nonly exists in fairytales.\n\n158\n00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.650\nSo in the physical world outside of\nthe Cloud where we can walk up and\n\n159\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.270\nactually audit systems directly.\n\n160\n00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.146\nThat doesn't happen in\nthe Cloud as we said.\n\n161\n00:07:51.146 --> 00:07:54.148\nSo we have to understand that\nthere are going to be changes,\n\n162\n00:07:54.148 --> 00:07:55.958\nthere are going to be constraints.\n\n163\n00:07:55.958 --> 00:07:59.969\nWe do need to know what those may be and\nwe have to assure ourselves of them, and\n\n164\n00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:01.810\ndocument them ahead of time.\n\n165\n00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.156\nWe have assurance challenges\nboth in the cloud, but\n\n166\n00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:06.355\nalso with the platforms\nthat support the cloud.\n\n167\n00:08:06.355 --> 00:08:10.103\nVirtualization technology is used to\nunderline the cloud as we know and\n\n168\n00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:14.413\nobtaining assurance from the cloud vendor\nattestations of what they're doing is\n\n169\n00:08:14.413 --> 00:08:16.780\nimportant, but it can be a challenge.\n\n170\n00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.462\nThey may not depending on the service\nmodel we are using have access to all of\n\n171\n00:08:21.462 --> 00:08:22.140\nthe data.\n\n172\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:26.913\nMeaning, the customer may control on the\nIS platform everything that is going on\n\n173\n00:08:26.913 --> 00:08:30.858\nand the customer, you have to\nprovide that data to your auditors.\n\n174\n00:08:30.858 --> 00:08:34.049\nThe cloud provider can provide\ncertain information, but\n\n175\n00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.840\nthere's a shared responsibility there.\n\n176\n00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.560\nIn the past model, there's also\na shared responsibility there.\n\n177\n00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.050\nAlthough the burden for\n\n178\n00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:46.923\nproviding the majority of the data\nis probably close to evenly split,\n\n179\n00:08:46.923 --> 00:08:53.545\nbecause the cloud provider owns the IS and\nthe operating environment on the hardware.\n\n180\n00:08:53.545 --> 00:08:56.625\nThe cloud customer owns\nthe application environment.\n\n181\n00:08:56.625 --> 00:09:00.504\nSo we're probably,\napproximately splitting that burden and\n\n182\n00:09:00.504 --> 00:09:04.175\nthat requirement for\nproviding clarity and access.\n\n183\n00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:09.432\nWhen it's sass, we really as the cloud\ncustomer only have rights to the data and\n\n184\n00:09:09.432 --> 00:09:14.550\nprobably user access control and\nidentity control of users on the platform.\n\n185\n00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.663\nWe've established that everybody else is\nthe proverbial of the cloud provider,\n\n186\n00:09:18.663 --> 00:09:21.285\nwhich means the cloud\nprovider owns the lion share,\n\n187\n00:09:21.285 --> 00:09:23.790\nthe burden of responsibility for\nas testation and\n\n188\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.190\naudit provisioning in terms of data that\nmay be provided to validate assumptions.\n\n189\n00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.665\nBut there is still a responsibility for\nthe customer, because the auditors will\n\n190\n00:09:31.665 --> 00:09:34.220\nprobably wanna randomly sample\nwhat users are able to do and\n\n191\n00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.025\nthe kind of data you are able to conceive.\n\n192\n00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:39.089\nSo there's gonna be a shared\nresponsibility there,\n\n193\n00:09:39.089 --> 00:09:40.730\nregardless of where we are.\n\n194\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.796\nBut with virtualization in particular,\nwe have to evaluate hyper visor security.\n\n195\n00:09:44.796 --> 00:09:47.898\nSo, how well implemented\nis the hypervisor?\n\n196\n00:09:47.898 --> 00:09:49.117\nIs it isolating?\n\n197\n00:09:49.117 --> 00:09:53.035\nCan we, essentially see VM escape\nhappening where VMs can jump?\n\n198\n00:09:53.035 --> 00:09:53.932\nAnd therefore,\n\n199\n00:09:53.932 --> 00:09:57.851\nbreak out of the isolation containment\nsandboxes that we put them into?\n\n200\n00:09:57.851 --> 00:10:00.929\nIs the system been patched and up to date?\n\n201\n00:10:00.929 --> 00:10:04.075\nOr is the vendor applying\nall the latest patches?\n\n202\n00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:06.905\nWe talked a lot about firmware patching\nand how important that can be.\n\n203\n00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:08.206\nAre they patching the OS?\n\n204\n00:10:08.206 --> 00:10:11.329\nAre they applying the security\npatches that the virtualization\n\n205\n00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:13.720\nvendors are recommending?\n\n206\n00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.587\nDo we understand the separation in\na software defined system between the data\n\n207\n00:10:17.587 --> 00:10:19.261\nplane and the management plane?\n\n208\n00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:20.970\nDo we understand how that's working?\n\n209\n00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.068\nHow that's being controlled?\n\n210\n00:10:22.068 --> 00:10:24.360\nAre we auditing that level of access?\n\n211\n00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.231\nDo we understand that there may be zoning?\n\n212\n00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:27.394\nThere may be masking.\n\n213\n00:10:27.394 --> 00:10:30.310\nThere may be physical,\nas well as logical isolation.\n\n214\n00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.366\nTaking place in\na multi-tenant environment.\n\n215\n00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:33.573\nHow is that happening?\n\n216\n00:10:33.573 --> 00:10:35.430\nAre we validating those controls?\n\n217\n00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.313\nWhat do they look like?\n\n218\n00:10:36.313 --> 00:10:38.070\nWe have to understand that.\n\n219\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.601\nWe have to negotiate ahead of time.\n\n220\n00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.225\nIn other words,\nthe right to get this information or\n\n221\n00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:45.446\nat least be given access to\nthe infrastructure that we control at\n\n222\n00:10:45.446 --> 00:10:48.260\na level that we can then\nvalidate it ourselves.\n\n223\n00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:53.320\nRemember, in a multi-tenanted hosting\nenvironment, we may not be given rights\n\n224\n00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:58.012\nto the host even though we are given\nrights to hardware, because the problem\n\n225\n00:10:58.012 --> 00:11:02.804\nmay be that there may be multiple clients\nrunning in that same resource pool.\n\n226\n00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:06.588\nAnd so we have to understand that we may\nbe given some rights, but not all and\n\n227\n00:11:06.588 --> 00:11:09.570\nthe vendor may control\ncertain infrastructure.\n\n228\n00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.908\nPass is a good example of this where you\nhave the vendor, the cloud providers\n\n229\n00:11:12.908 --> 00:11:16.094\ncontrolling, essentially the underlying\noperational environment,\n\n230\n00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:17.987\nwe're controlling the app environment.\n\n231\n00:11:17.987 --> 00:11:22.406\nWe have to understand that there may be\ncertain very well-defined breaks here and\n\n232\n00:11:22.406 --> 00:11:24.800\nthat we may sit on one or the other side.\n\n233\n00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.580\nAnd as a result, we may or may not have\nall of the levels of access we would\n\n234\n00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.109\nnormally expect in\na non-cloud environment.\n\n235\n00:11:31.109 --> 00:11:35.244\nYet, we still need access to that\ninformation to conduct an audit.\n\n236\n00:11:35.244 --> 00:11:37.700\nAnd so, it is definitely going\nto be a little bit different.\n\n237\n00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.018\nWe have to go through an information\ngathering process and we have to go\n\n238\n00:11:41.018 --> 00:11:45.253\nthrough and essentially figure out how to\nidentify, collect, document, structure.\n\n239\n00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:48.641\nAnd ultimately, communicate information\nabout all of these things in order to\n\n240\n00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.710\nbetter understand what's happening.\n\n241\n00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:51.335\n>> Adam, really quickly.\n\n242\n00:11:51.335 --> 00:11:54.921\nWhen it comes to audits happening,\nwe tend to like, I work for a company.\n\n243\n00:11:54.921 --> 00:11:57.620\nWe did third party out,\nit's forbidden in internal audits.\n\n244\n00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:01.053\nIf I was using a cloud provider and\nI know the cloud provider,\n\n245\n00:12:01.053 --> 00:12:04.840\ncuz we've mentioned this as well\nthat they do their own auditing.\n\n246\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.870\nDo third party enter this tend to just\nsay, well, the copywriter has done\n\n247\n00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:12.250\nan audit and we accept that as an audit or\ndo we see a lot of yeah,\n\n248\n00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.215\nI know you did your own audit, but\nwe're here to do our own audit as well.\n\n249\n00:12:16.215 --> 00:12:18.150\nAnd now, we've gotta work\nwith allowing me to do that.\n\n250\n00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.400\n>> So in the majority of cloud\nhosting models and the majority\n\n251\n00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.940\nof the cloud infrastructure that's\nprovided by very large entities today,\n\n252\n00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:32.590\nthe Microsoft's, the Amazons,\nthe Googles of the world.\n\n253\n00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:37.192\nWe don't really have the ability or\nthe capacity to show up and say,\n\n254\n00:12:37.192 --> 00:12:40.260\nhey, we're here with\na team from Deloitte or\n\n255\n00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.894\nwe're here from a team from\nPricewaterhouseCoopers or whatever.\n\n256\n00:12:44.894 --> 00:12:47.130\nABC Auditing Corp, whatever it is.\n\n257\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.466\nWe're here to do an audit.\n\n258\n00:12:48.466 --> 00:12:51.210\nThat happens only if the company itself.\n\n259\n00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.656\nGoogle itself says, hey,\nyou're gonna come in.\n\n260\n00:12:52.656 --> 00:12:56.270\nWe're hiring you as our external third\nparty auditor and you're gonna come in,\n\n261\n00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.291\nand do an audit for us.\n\n262\n00:12:57.291 --> 00:12:59.570\nCompany wide, you're auditing Google.\n\n263\n00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:03.790\nYou're not auditing company X on Google,\nyou're auditing Google.\n\n264\n00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.919\nAnd so then Google takes those findings or\nAmazon or Microsoft takes those findings,\n\n265\n00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:11.998\nthe audit and\nthey do their own use as you indicate.\n\n266\n00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:15.740\nThere will be internal auditing that's\ngoing on continuously from these\n\n267\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.660\ncompanies.\n\n268\n00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.070\nIt is done under the guise of continuous\nmonitoring and security management,\n\n269\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:24.660\nand there's also specifically auditing\nresponsibilities that are apportioned out,\n\n270\n00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.600\nand are done.\n\n271\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.743\nAnd carry it out either on a weekly,\nmonthly, quarterly, whatever the basis is.\n\n272\n00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:31.690\nDepending on what the business is and\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n273\n00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.862\nSo there is that internal sanity check,\nbut\n\n274\n00:13:33.862 --> 00:13:36.573\nthe internal audits are not\nused to format testation.\n\n275\n00:13:36.573 --> 00:13:39.627\nAnd to show compliance, because in\na sense they are tainted in the eye\n\n276\n00:13:39.627 --> 00:13:42.960\nof the customer, because well,\nyou're telling me you're good Daniel.\n\n277\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.691\nSo well, you think you're good,\nbut how do I really know?\n\n278\n00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:48.536\nSo it's important for you to know you're\ngood, but it's more important for\n\n279\n00:13:48.536 --> 00:13:49.981\nsomebody else who doesn't know you and\n\n280\n00:13:49.981 --> 00:13:53.500\ndoesn't owe you anything to tell me you're\ngood, cuz it's what the customers think.\n\n281\n00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.144\nWhat we would say.\n\n282\n00:13:54.144 --> 00:13:56.817\nAnd so as a result,\nwe do both as you rightly pointed out.\n\n283\n00:13:56.817 --> 00:14:01.164\nAnd so there is that internal thought\nprocess, but that's really meant more so,\n\n284\n00:14:01.164 --> 00:14:05.030\nso that they can document, identify and\ndeal with internal issues.\n\n285\n00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.489\nAnd regulate their environment and\nhave their own sense of governance, and\n\n286\n00:14:08.489 --> 00:14:10.281\ncompliance that they manage against.\n\n287\n00:14:10.281 --> 00:14:14.837\nThe external audit that's done,\nat least once a year on these platforms by\n\n288\n00:14:14.837 --> 00:14:19.104\nexternal trusted third parties that\nare not being owned by, paid by,\n\n289\n00:14:19.104 --> 00:14:21.300\nmanaged by, any of these vendors.\n\n290\n00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.273\nSo, Microsoft doesn't own the auditing.\n\n291\n00:14:23.273 --> 00:14:25.710\nConcern comes and does their audits.\n\n292\n00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.398\nIt's an impartial third party.\n\n293\n00:14:27.398 --> 00:14:28.199\nSame thing with Google.\n\n294\n00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:29.939\nSame thing with Amazon.\n\n295\n00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:32.930\nThey pay to have that done.\n\n296\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:37.565\nThose audit findings may very well\nwind up turning into some form of\n\n297\n00:14:37.565 --> 00:14:39.984\nattestation given to customers.\n\n298\n00:14:39.984 --> 00:14:42.927\nWe're gonna talk about sock\nreporting gear in a little bit and\n\n299\n00:14:42.927 --> 00:14:44.410\nthe different levels of sock.\n\n300\n00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.098\nSock one, sock two, sock three and what\nis or is not shared and who uses it and\n\n301\n00:14:49.098 --> 00:14:51.461\nwhy it's important when you need it.\n\n302\n00:14:51.461 --> 00:14:54.684\nSo you go through that and that's\na good reference point for some of us,\n\n303\n00:14:54.684 --> 00:14:57.693\nbecause not every audit we do is\nmeant to be seen by every customer or\n\n304\n00:14:57.693 --> 00:14:59.480\nindeed by every interest group.\n\n305\n00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.956\nSome audits are done simply for\n\n306\n00:15:00.956 --> 00:15:03.466\nthe express purpose of\nbeing consumed internally.\n\n307\n00:15:03.466 --> 00:15:06.940\nSome audits are done with the express\npurpose of being consumed externally.\n\n308\n00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.397\nSome are being done with the express\npurpose of understanding the financial\n\n309\n00:15:10.397 --> 00:15:11.861\ncontrols applied by a company.\n\n310\n00:15:11.861 --> 00:15:13.899\nSome are being done with\nthe express interest and\n\n311\n00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:17.330\nconcern of understanding the information\nsecurity controls being done.\n\n312\n00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:18.916\nSo, it depends on the type of audit.\n\n313\n00:15:18.916 --> 00:15:20.044\nDepends on the focus and\n\n314\n00:15:20.044 --> 00:15:23.940\nit depends ultimately on the business\nrequirements that are driving it.\n\n315\n00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:24.954\nSo, it's a mixed bag.\n\n316\n00:15:24.954 --> 00:15:28.457\nWe definitely see both, but we ultimately\nwill find that those companies,\n\n317\n00:15:28.457 --> 00:15:32.430\nthe big ones and the little ones that\nare in the hosting business, all of them.\n\n318\n00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.546\nThe ones that are feeling it's important\nenough to provide a impartial third party\n\n319\n00:15:36.546 --> 00:15:40.076\nas testation through external audit\nwill summarize those findings and\n\n320\n00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:43.576\nwill then make them available in some\nsort of form to their customers.\n\n321\n00:15:43.576 --> 00:15:47.440\nTypically on demand, there's a process\nyou must go through to request them.\n\n322\n00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.267\nIt's not just like they\nsend them out to everybody.\n\n323\n00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:52.999\nYou have to be a customer of\nthe company to see them typically.\n\n324\n00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:55.653\nThey're not gonna give them out to\npeople who don't host with them,\n\n325\n00:15:55.653 --> 00:15:58.905\nbecause they don't want that information\nbeing shared unless you are a customer not\n\n326\n00:15:58.905 --> 00:16:00.486\nnecessarily cause there's anything.\n\n327\n00:16:00.486 --> 00:16:04.210\nThat could be used against the company\nfrom a security perspective.\n\n328\n00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.530\nBut it's information about the company,\nwhat they do and\n\n329\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.250\nhow they do it on behalf\nof their customers.\n\n330\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.450\nAnd so they share it with their customers,\nbut they don't tend to share it broadly\n\n331\n00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.330\nwithout, outside that trusted circle,\nright.\n\n332\n00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:18.540\nMoney equals trust, right.\n\n333\n00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.630\nSo if you're contracted\nyou're paying money,\n\n334\n00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.840\nwe assume we could trust you at least for\na year anyway,\n\n335\n00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.080\nwhile you pay your bills and see how\nthey'll share that with those customers.\n\n336\n00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.255\nAnd you can actually go if you go to any\nof these vendors, you can go to Microsoft\n\n337\n00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:36.820\n365.com, or Office Online, or\noffice.online.com, whatever it is.\n\n338\n00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.632\nBut you can Google it,\n[LAUGH] right, just figure it out.\n\n339\n00:16:38.632 --> 00:16:39.144\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n340\n00:16:39.144 --> 00:16:40.224\n>> But you can go to Amazon,\n\n341\n00:16:40.224 --> 00:16:44.494\nyou can go to Microsoft, etc.\nAnd if you search for audit\n\n342\n00:16:44.494 --> 00:16:48.590\nattestation on Google, with these vendors.\nOr if you search for\n\n343\n00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.470\nreport, you'll find that they have\na link on their attestation page.\n\n344\n00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:53.510\nThey all maintain them.\n\n345\n00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.350\nWhere they will list for you,\n\n346\n00:16:55.350 --> 00:17:00.360\nif you're a customer, all of the auditable\ninformation and the reports they provide.\n\n347\n00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.960\nAnd it says, okay, click here.\n\n348\n00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:02.990\nAnd it says, hey, log in.\n\n349\n00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:04.140\nAnd you've got to be a customer.\n\n350\n00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.190\nAnd then you can download and\nsee the report, whatever it is.\n\n351\n00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.400\nSo all the vendors do provide this.\n\n352\n00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.050\nBut it's a question of you really\nhave to have that trust relationship\n\n353\n00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.780\nin order to be able to consume\nthe information more often than not.\n\n354\n00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.970\nSo it's a good question to think about,\nreally good question to ask.\n\n355\n00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.750\nBecause we want to make sure we have\na sense of the fact that both indeed of\n\n356\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.760\nthese kinds of things are happening or\nis happening.\n\n357\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.620\nSo we were talking about\ninformation gathering and\n\n358\n00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:27.680\nhow we can get all that stuff together.\n\n359\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.260\nWe have to think about all\nthe different information we need.\n\n360\n00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.840\nWe just talked about some of the things\nthat an audit attestation may actually\n\n361\n00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.590\nshare, the financial stability, maybe\nthe security posture of the organization.\n\n362\n00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.432\nAnd there's different focal points, right?\n\n363\n00:17:40.432 --> 00:17:44.074\nSo we want to have all of that, we\ntypically focus on the risks that may be\n\n364\n00:17:44.074 --> 00:17:47.599\nout there that we're addressing,\nwe focus on the security regime or\n\n365\n00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:51.101\nframework we're putting in place\nfrom a management perspective.\n\n366\n00:17:51.101 --> 00:17:54.919\nSo audit scope statements are going to\nhelp to really scale and set this up,\n\n367\n00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:57.949\nwe set the scope of the audit,\nthe focal point of the audit,\n\n368\n00:17:57.949 --> 00:17:59.361\nwhat we are going to cover.\n\n369\n00:17:59.361 --> 00:18:03.310\nWhat we're not gonna cover\nwith regards to audit scoping.\n\n370\n00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:06.750\nSo audit scope statements are an important\nfunctional control element or\n\n371\n00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.440\ntool regarding audits.\n\n372\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.580\nThe cloud audit scope is gonna obviously\nbe set up a little bit differently\n\n373\n00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.677\nthan a traditional audit.\n\n374\n00:18:12.677 --> 00:18:17.055\nWhen I show up as an auditor,\nas I do on many occasions with customers.\n\n375\n00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:19.340\nAnd I say to them,\nhey what are we here to do today.\n\n376\n00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.065\nLike you invited me over,\nwhat am I here to do?\n\n377\n00:18:22.065 --> 00:18:23.755\nI don't say that when I show up,\n\n378\n00:18:23.755 --> 00:18:25.830\nthat actually happens before\nI come on site, right.\n\n379\n00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.292\nCuz we have negotiated\nan agreement already.\n\n380\n00:18:28.292 --> 00:18:31.352\nA statement of work, used formal\nproject management language and\n\n381\n00:18:31.352 --> 00:18:33.502\nwe already know what the audit scope is.\n\n382\n00:18:33.502 --> 00:18:35.632\nAnd they've said okay, this is what\nwe want you to come onsite and\n\n383\n00:18:35.632 --> 00:18:37.272\nhelp us to understand.\n\n384\n00:18:37.272 --> 00:18:38.822\nI show up and then we get to business.\n\n385\n00:18:38.822 --> 00:18:42.642\nSo the audit scope is essentially\nthe statement of work with regards to\n\n386\n00:18:42.642 --> 00:18:43.322\nthe audit.\n\n387\n00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:46.092\nI did say we're gonna mention and\ntalk about audit reports.\n\n388\n00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:48.382\nYou set that one up when you\nhad asked that question,\n\n389\n00:18:48.382 --> 00:18:50.000\nwhen we were talking\na little bit about it.\n\n390\n00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.870\nI know that you have a little chart,\nsir, that we have worked on, so\n\n391\n00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:53.550\nwe're gonna throw that up.\n\n392\n00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:56.070\nIf we could look at Daniel's desktop,\noutstanding.\n\n393\n00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.260\nCan we zoom in a little bit maybe?\n\n394\n00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.850\n>> Sure, I figured we'd go to\nwhichever one you wanna go to first\n\n395\n00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.390\nand we'll move around.\n\n396\n00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.880\n>> Absolutely, well we wanna talk about so\nSOC 1, we'll kinda start at the top and\n\n397\n00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.170\njust work our way down, absolutely.\n\n398\n00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:07.050\n>> Start with SOC 1, all right.\n\n399\n00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.280\n>> Yeah, cuz I know it's\nvery hard to see all three.\n\n400\n00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.600\nSo we're gonna go in and take a look.\n\n401\n00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.200\nAnd what we'll see and let's just\nyeah I was gonna say just go up for\n\n402\n00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.700\na second let's just tell\neverybody what we got there.\n\n403\n00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.180\nSo in the first column we\nhave the report numbers,\n\n404\n00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.070\nthese will be the three different\ntype of audit reports, SOC 1, SOC 2,\n\n405\n00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:26.280\nSOC 3 we'll go through each one and\nmake sure we see what they are.\n\n406\n00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.050\nWe then have a column for\nusers there right so\n\n407\n00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:33.030\nwe're gonna be able to see what the use or\nthe users rather are or\n\n408\n00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:38.100\nis going to be that we are going\nto be using that report for.\n\n409\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:43.420\nOr, excuse me, who is going to be\nusing the report is what I should say.\n\n410\n00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:46.090\nAnd what the expectation will be.\n\n411\n00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.510\nAnd then concern,\n\n412\n00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:51.150\nconcern is gonna be essentially what\nwe are addressing with this report.\n\n413\n00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.710\nSo what is the report designed\nto essentially provide or\n\n414\n00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:54.980\ndetailed out for us.\n\n415\n00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.260\nAnd then the detail required\nin terms of what the report\n\n416\n00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.710\nactually will cover how the report\nis set up more or less.\n\n417\n00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:04.160\nWhat it speaks to is what\nwe will talk about there.\n\n418\n00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.780\nSo we're gonna start on the left and\njust kinda zoom back over.\n\n419\n00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:08.205\nAnd we're gonna talk first about SOC 1.\n\n420\n00:20:08.205 --> 00:20:12.005\nWe'll move to SOC 2 and\nthen ultimately SOC 3.\n\n421\n00:20:12.005 --> 00:20:17.698\nSo SOC 1 is going to as you can see there,\nReally be thinking about,\n\n422\n00:20:17.698 --> 00:20:22.724\nand reporting on, controls at a service\norganization, relevant to the user\n\n423\n00:20:22.724 --> 00:20:28.390\nentity's internal controls over\nfinancial reporting, and financial data.\n\n424\n00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:32.170\nSo, this is really focusing on\nthe financial health of the organization,\n\n425\n00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.910\nwhat they're doing, how they're doing it,\nhow they're, executing their business, and\n\n426\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.563\nwhat they're doing from\na financial perspective.\n\n427\n00:20:39.563 --> 00:20:43.149\nThis whole set of audit reports SOC 1,\nSOC 2 SOC 3,\n\n428\n00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:47.556\ncomes to us originally from what\nused to be known as the SAAS 70.\n\n429\n00:20:47.556 --> 00:20:53.355\nAll right a statement of auditing\nstandards number 70 which is the name and\n\n430\n00:20:53.355 --> 00:20:58.620\nthe number of the audit report that SOC 1,\nSOC 2, SOC 3 replaces.\n\n431\n00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.094\nSAAS 70 was very popular for a long time.\n\n432\n00:21:01.094 --> 00:21:03.157\nIt has been updated and replaced and\n\n433\n00:21:03.157 --> 00:21:06.680\nrevised with an look\ntowards the cloud services.\n\n434\n00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.370\nSpecifically, lately with SOC 1,\nSOC 2 and SOC 3.\n\n435\n00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.490\nSOC 1, SOC 2 and SOC 3 is conducted\nunderneath and with alignment of,\n\n436\n00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:20.150\nor in accordance with something known\nas SSAE, the Statement on Standards for\n\n437\n00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.690\nAttestation Engagements.\n\n438\n00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.980\nSpecifically SSAE number 16.\n\n439\n00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:29.680\nSo SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3 reporting is\nreally aligned with SSAE 16 as a standard,\n\n440\n00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.520\nthat replaces SAS 70 which is the older\nstandard that is really no longer\n\n441\n00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.340\nreferenced at least in this particular\narea for this kind of reporting and so\n\n442\n00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:42.610\nas a result we are now\ngoing to be using this.\n\n443\n00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.420\nAnd this is really a United States\ncentric thought process,\n\n444\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.970\nSASS or SSA 16, then SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3.\n\n445\n00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.910\nThere is an international\nequivalent of this.\n\n446\n00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.620\nThe international equivalent\nwill be the IAASB,\n\n447\n00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:59.460\nwhich is the International Auditing and\nAssurance Standards Board\n\n448\n00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.000\nequivalent that is going to be essentially\nthe international version of this.\n\n449\n00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.555\nAnd that is going to be\nreferences ISAE 3402,\n\n450\n00:22:07.555 --> 00:22:11.445\ngotta look all that up on my notes cuz\nI can't keep all that straight in my\n\n451\n00:22:11.445 --> 00:22:13.945\nhead even on a good day I\ncan't keep all that straight.\n\n452\n00:22:13.945 --> 00:22:18.375\nSo the international standard essentially\nthe equivalent of SOC 1 SOC 2 SOC 3 is\n\n453\n00:22:18.375 --> 00:22:23.565\ncommonly referred to as ISAE 3402 but\nwe often refer to SOC\n\n454\n00:22:23.565 --> 00:22:29.015\n1 SOC 2 SOC 3 and or\nSSAE 16 as simply representing that.\n\n455\n00:22:29.015 --> 00:22:32.780\nThat would be more of a United States\ncentric discussion, but generically,\n\n456\n00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.780\nthe idea hurts this really focuses on\nprimarily of financial reporting and\n\n457\n00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.860\ncontrols over financial reporting and\nthe issues and concerns around them.\n\n458\n00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.360\nThe concern there affect a service\norganization's control as you can see\n\n459\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.400\nthere on the organization's financial\nassertions and then, what kind of detail.\n\n460\n00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.430\nWhat kind of stuff do we actually need\nspecifically to be able to provide\n\n461\n00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.370\na SOC 1 report requires details on\nthe system you can see, controls, testing,\n\n462\n00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.445\nperformed by the service auditor and\nthe results of those tests.\n\n463\n00:23:00.445 --> 00:23:04.360\nSo we're gonna essentially get an audited\nreport on the financial state and\n\n464\n00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.960\nfinancial health and the financial\ncontrols associated with the organization.\n\n465\n00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.890\nNow a SOC 1 report,\nbecause it has that kind of information,\n\n466\n00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.750\nis going to certainly be issued,\nand is gonna be used.\n\n467\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.860\nBut we often tend to see that\nSOC 1 reports are issued and\n\n468\n00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.140\nused internally by the company,\nso that they can validate their\n\n469\n00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.960\nown financial reporting,\nthey can validate their own assertions.\n\n470\n00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.840\nThis is not something we\n\n471\n00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.140\nneglect to somebody who's\nnot a customer first of all.\n\n472\n00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.430\nCuz this has obviously,\n\n473\n00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.530\ninformation about the company that\nwe would not want to widely share.\n\n474\n00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:36.279\nBut this is certainly something that we\nare going to have to have and indeed need.\n\n475\n00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.679\nCan we actually take a field trip\nreal quick, while we're doing this?\n\n476\n00:23:38.679 --> 00:23:39.371\n>> Sure.\n\n477\n00:23:39.371 --> 00:23:41.758\n>> Can you go to the web,\njust while we're on here,\n\n478\n00:23:41.758 --> 00:23:43.689\nwe'll zoom back to this just a second.\n\n479\n00:23:43.689 --> 00:23:45.602\nCan you go out to Google?\n\n480\n00:23:45.602 --> 00:23:50.190\nAnd can you just open up a clean tab and\n\n481\n00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:55.226\ncan you Google SOC 1 report for Amazon.\n\n482\n00:23:55.226 --> 00:23:59.561\nI'm not sure what we'll find per se out\nthere but do you have a link for SOC 1 or\n\n483\n00:23:59.561 --> 00:24:03.530\ngenerically SOC reporting for Amazon,\nI'm not sure how it comes up.\n\n484\n00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:04.819\n>> It looks like it does, it says.\n\n485\n00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:06.717\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> You can just click on that one,\n\n486\n00:24:06.717 --> 00:24:08.906\nI just wanna show people\nwhat it may look like.\n\n487\n00:24:08.906 --> 00:24:12.396\nSo you'll see as I mention they have\nan attestation or compliance page,\n\n488\n00:24:12.396 --> 00:24:13.376\nevery vendor does.\n\n489\n00:24:13.376 --> 00:24:15.350\nAnd you could Google for this,\nyou can obviously go out and\n\n490\n00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.119\nfind this on your own.\n\n491\n00:24:16.119 --> 00:24:20.520\nAnd you'll see they have\nAICPA SOC report structure there.\n\n492\n00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:25.590\nAICPA is the United States branch or\narm, of the association for\n\n493\n00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:29.080\nCPAs that is gonna drive\nthe standards that's behind this.\n\n494\n00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.310\nSo they're the trade group essentially\nthat's behind the SSAE 16 and\n\n495\n00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.830\nSAS 70 standards and ultimately are the\nones that set up the standards, and\n\n496\n00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:40.420\nthe functionality that we engage in\nwith the audit for the SOC reporting.\n\n497\n00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.050\nThat's just the cover group like OASIS,\nbut in the United States for this,\n\n498\n00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.010\nit's AICPA.\n\n499\n00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:48.490\nSo if you find there, if we can zoom in\nfor a second so they can see what's there,\n\n500\n00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.210\nyou'll see there's some links there,\nthere's a little bit of language.\n\n501\n00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:56.090\nIt says hey, the AWS Service\nOrganization Control (SOC) reports\n\n502\n00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:00.160\nare gonna be independently derived by\nthird party attestation blah blah blah,\n\n503\n00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.670\nand you'll see that there are links.\n\n504\n00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.420\nNow, you'll notice that AWS SOC 1 and\nSOC 2 are there but they're not linked and\n\n505\n00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.890\nyou can't get to them.\n\n506\n00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:07.640\nThey do exist.\n\n507\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.547\nBut they're not gonna\ngive them out to you.\n\n508\n00:25:08.547 --> 00:25:09.702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n509\n00:25:09.702 --> 00:25:11.700\nyou'll notice there is a SOC 3 link there.\n\n510\n00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:14.140\nWe're gonna come back to SOC 3 and\ntalk about what it is.\n\n511\n00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.810\nBut you'll see that you could click on it.\n\n512\n00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:16.950\nJust click on the link real quick.\n\n513\n00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.560\nWe'll define what it is in just a minute.\n\n514\n00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.017\nGo ahead and do that.\nAnd you'll see that it will download for\n\n515\n00:25:21.017 --> 00:25:24.790\nyou, essentially, a PDF that opens up and\ngives you a SOC 3 report.\n\n516\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.227\nIt's dated for\nthe last six months of April,\n\n517\n00:25:27.227 --> 00:25:29.741\nfrom April to September of 2015, right?\n\n518\n00:25:29.741 --> 00:25:31.145\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that's the last time\n\n519\n00:25:31.145 --> 00:25:35.004\nthey engaged in that report gathering and\nthat auditing timeline,\n\n520\n00:25:35.004 --> 00:25:37.652\nand they've put that out there and\nissued it.\n\n521\n00:25:37.652 --> 00:25:42.247\nAnd we'll talk about what a SOC 3 is,\nbut it's essentially a trust services\n\n522\n00:25:42.247 --> 00:25:46.986\nprincipal report that tells us what the\nsecurity solutions are that the vendors\n\n523\n00:25:46.986 --> 00:25:51.107\nare gauging in and it's also sometimes\ncalled the web seal of trust.\n\n524\n00:25:51.107 --> 00:25:55.754\nYou'll see it offered by someone like\nAmazon to their customers to validate that\n\n525\n00:25:55.754 --> 00:25:58.700\nthey are a secure Cloud\nprovider essentially.\n\n526\n00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.690\nAnd so,\nthey make that available to everybody.\n\n527\n00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.340\nThey're for general use,\nthey're typically consumed by anybody.\n\n528\n00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.740\nBut you'll see SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports\nare not just widely distributed and\n\n529\n00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:07.470\nmade available.\n\n530\n00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.090\nThey're held, essentially, either for\ncertain costumers and, or for\n\n531\n00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:12.440\nboards of directors.\n\n532\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.840\nAnd for internal or maybe limited\ndistribution use because they have\n\n533\n00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:19.120\nsensitive information that the company may\nnot wanna widely share with everybody.\n\n534\n00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.410\nSo we have to understand the different\nways in which these reports are generated.\n\n535\n00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:25.870\nThe focus they have, but\nalso the general use that we may find.\n\n536\n00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:29.050\nIf you did this for Microsoft,\nyou did this for VMware, you did this for\n\n537\n00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.430\nanybody that's a major Cloud provider,\n\n538\n00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:34.070\nyou would essentially land on a page very\nsimilar, and see something that's very\n\n539\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.980\nsimilar to what we're looking at right\nnow from any one of those vendors.\n\n540\n00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.154\nThey're all gonna give you a SOC 3.\n\n541\n00:26:38.154 --> 00:26:40.595\nAnd they'll have SOC 1 and\nSOC 2 reports available,\n\n542\n00:26:40.595 --> 00:26:43.832\nalthough they may not make them\navailable outside their customer base or\n\n543\n00:26:43.832 --> 00:26:47.760\noutside the internal employee base of\nthe organization, depending on what it is.\n\n544\n00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.393\nCan we go back to the chart so we can just\ncontinue talking about SOC 2 and SOC 3?\n\n545\n00:26:52.393 --> 00:26:54.110\nSo let's go to SOC 2 if we can.\n\n546\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.840\nSOC 2 is essentially gonna be\nan examination of the design and\n\n547\n00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.590\nthe operating effectiveness that controls\nthat are setup to meet the criteria for\n\n548\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.940\nthe appropriate levels of protection\nthat we are trying to achieve.\n\n549\n00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.560\nSo we're gonna look at the security\ninfrastructure as well as all the other\n\n550\n00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:15.930\nsupporting elements, so entities,\nregulators, business partners, and\n\n551\n00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.010\nothers with knowledge to appropriately\nuse this report can be given it.\n\n552\n00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:21.090\nSo it's just that, trusted partners.\n\n553\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:23.100\nWe're not just gonna give it\nout to the general public, but\n\n554\n00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:27.420\nwe'll give it out to any vendor, we'll\ngive it out to an internal customer or\n\n555\n00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:30.310\nfederated partner,\nthat needs to understand what we're doing,\n\n556\n00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.390\nand that we need to understand\nhow they are gonna interact with.\n\n557\n00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.020\nSo that's what a SOC 2 report is\ngenerally gonna be focused around.\n\n558\n00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.930\nYou'll see as we move over,\nit is going to look at the controls\n\n559\n00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.950\nat the service organization, as I said,\nrelated to security, availability,\n\n560\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.140\nprocessing, integrity,\nconfidentiality, and/or privacy.\n\n561\n00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:48.930\nAll the information,\nsecurity related controls,\n\n562\n00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.950\nthe ISMS, the Information\nSecurity Management System.\n\n563\n00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.710\nAnd all the architecture and\nsupporting elements around it.\n\n564\n00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.780\nAnd you'll see what we need\nover there on the right.\n\n565\n00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.900\nTerms of requirements, details on all\nof these things have to be available.\n\n566\n00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.332\nAnd then, independently verified by our\nauditors, in order to be part of that.\n\n567\n00:28:04.332 --> 00:28:07.727\nAnd within SOC 2, although before\nwe go to SOC 3, within Soc 2,\n\n568\n00:28:07.727 --> 00:28:11.140\nwe have 2 specific subtypes of\nreports that you wanna be aware of.\n\n569\n00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:13.060\nType one and type two.\n\n570\n00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:16.360\nType one, we did in detail this on\nthe trial, we'll just talk about them.\n\n571\n00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.200\nType one is report on\nmanagement's description\n\n572\n00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.480\nof the service organization system and\nthe suitability of the controls.\n\n573\n00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.830\nSo type one is about management's\n\n574\n00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.750\ndescription of the suitability and\ndesign of the control.\n\n575\n00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.500\nSo centrally, in awe, how we are\narchitecting and whether or not we are in\n\n576\n00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.941\nline from a governess prospective,\nwith that, so is the design, is\n\n577\n00:28:40.941 --> 00:28:46.015\nthe architecture sound from a management\nprospective as type one, type two?\n\n578\n00:28:46.015 --> 00:28:49.255\nSo a SOC 2 type 1, SOC 2 type 2.\n\n579\n00:28:49.255 --> 00:28:55.580\nSOC 2 type 2 is about how we actually\nare going to be operating those controls.\n\n580\n00:28:55.580 --> 00:29:00.490\nSo are we implementing effectively and\nare we using those controls the right way?\n\n581\n00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:03.180\nThat's SOC 2 type 2.\n\n582\n00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.280\nSo type one is all about,\ndid we design the right way?\n\n583\n00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.750\nAre we aligned with the proper\nregulatory concerns?\n\n584\n00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:11.590\nHave we addressed them from\nthe design perspective?\n\n585\n00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:14.010\nType two is all about,\nhave we implemented correctly?\n\n586\n00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.920\nAnd are we addressing them from\nthe operational perspective?\n\n587\n00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:18.820\nAnd we wanna differentiate\nbetween the 2 and\n\n588\n00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.600\nmake sure we understand that\nboth of those viewpoints or\n\n589\n00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.160\nvantage points are important but\nthey are part of the SOC 2 reporting.\n\n590\n00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.140\nThey're subreports essentially,\ntype one and type two.\n\n591\n00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.170\nAnd then, we have type three.\n\n592\n00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:31.906\nSince we've already taken a look at SOC 3.\n\n593\n00:29:31.906 --> 00:29:32.870\nType three, I'm sorry.\n\n594\n00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.240\nWe're gonna take a look\nat SOC 3 not type 3.\n\n595\n00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.933\nWe've taken a look at SOC 3 already.\n\n596\n00:29:36.933 --> 00:29:39.601\nAny users, any customer with a need for\nconfidence\n\n597\n00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:43.760\nin the service organization's controls\ncan get as you saw on the view request,\n\n598\n00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.970\na SOC 3 we don't even need to log in.\n\n599\n00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.280\nAll we need to do is just go out\nan Google for it and find it.\n\n600\n00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.620\nSo it's probably consumable.\n\n601\n00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.297\nAnybody can get one, so\nit's widely, broadly available.\n\n602\n00:29:52.297 --> 00:29:56.311\nIt is gonna speak to the effectiveness\nof controls at the organizational\n\n603\n00:29:56.311 --> 00:29:57.110\nlevel there.\n\n604\n00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.740\nAs you can see,\nvery similar in thought process to SOC 2,\n\n605\n00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.080\neffectiveness of controls at the service\norganization related to security,\n\n606\n00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.270\navailability, processing, integrity,\nconfidentiality and/or privacy.\n\n607\n00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:11.574\nSOC 3 is essentially an external\nfacing version of SOC 2.\n\n608\n00:30:11.574 --> 00:30:13.060\nIf you wanna think of it that way.\n\n609\n00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.650\nIt's essentially a version\nthat is going to be\n\n610\n00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:18.610\nsanitized to the point that it can\nbe given to anybody, whether or\n\n611\n00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.140\nnot they are a member of that\ntrusted circle of the organization.\n\n612\n00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.310\nSo it has the same kind of information.\n\n613\n00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.680\nBut probably not to the same depth and\nlevel of detail.\n\n614\n00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.360\n>> The black ink over everything,\nredacted.\n\n615\n00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.820\n>> It's redacted, or you get like two\nwords, and everything else is gone.\n\n616\n00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:35.063\nThe, and and, typically,\nare the two words you get to see.\n\n617\n00:30:35.063 --> 00:30:37.415\nYou see a lot of the, and a lot of and.\n\n618\n00:30:37.415 --> 00:30:41.944\nObviously you will see there, it requires\nessentially a scoping and tailoring and\n\n619\n00:30:41.944 --> 00:30:46.098\nnarrowing if you look at the actual\nrequirement from the SOC 3 to the SOC 2.\n\n620\n00:30:46.098 --> 00:30:48.405\nYou'll see limited,\nthe word limited there.\n\n621\n00:30:48.405 --> 00:30:51.380\nLimited information focused on\nthe boundary of the system and\n\n622\n00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.330\nthe achievement of applicable\ntrust services criteria.\n\n623\n00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.930\nWhere if we scroll up for\na minute to what we were looking at for\n\n624\n00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.390\nSOC 2, you'll see requires\ndetail on system, controls,\n\n625\n00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.333\ntesting performed by service auditor and\nresults of those tests.\n\n626\n00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:08.710\nSo SOC 2 is gonna be broader and deeper,\nSOC 3 is gonna be narrowly defined and\n\n627\n00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:12.070\nshallower cuz it's essentially\nbeing scrubbed for\n\n628\n00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.630\nexternal consumption\nin terms of the focus.\n\n629\n00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.240\nSo these are the reports\nthat we are going to see,\n\n630\n00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.790\nthe audit attestation items that\ncan be delivered for us typically,\n\n631\n00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:26.300\nthe types of auditing reports we will,\nmore often than not, find in the Cloud.\n\n632\n00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:28.070\nThere are maybe others certainly.\n\n633\n00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:32.150\nBut in general these are the types\nthat we refer to as CCSPs.\n\n634\n00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:36.420\nYou need to understand what a SOC 1,\nSOC 2 and SOC 3 report are.\n\n635\n00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.790\nWhy they are used,\nwho the appropriate audiences will be.\n\n636\n00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.240\nYou should also understand\nthat SOC 2 has 2 categories.\n\n637\n00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.590\nSOC 2 type 1 and SOC 2 type 2,\nshould understand the subtle but\n\n638\n00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:51.360\nimportant difference there, between design\nof controls and operation of controls.\n\n639\n00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.370\nMake sure we are conversing with and\ncomfortable with all of that.\n\n640\n00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:59.160\nWe do need to have audit\nscope statements of work.\n\n641\n00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.026\nWe also need to have\naudit scope restrictions.\n\n642\n00:32:01.026 --> 00:32:02.879\nWhat is not gonna be part of the audit.\n\n643\n00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:03.910\nSo what is in scope,\n\n644\n00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:08.056\nwe often say, and what is out of scope is\nequally important for us to think about.\n\n645\n00:32:08.056 --> 00:32:12.089\nWe also have to think about the idea of\nthe gap analysis that we will often do as\n\n646\n00:32:12.089 --> 00:32:15.430\npart of an audit to understand\nwhat is happening, right?\n\n647\n00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.872\nAnd then as a result of that,\nwhat should be happening, [LAUGH] right?\n\n648\n00:32:18.872 --> 00:32:20.322\nSo we look at the as is state.\n\n649\n00:32:20.322 --> 00:32:22.130\nWe wanna look at the to be state.\n\n650\n00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.920\nAnd then we have to examine the delta,\nor the gap between the two.\n\n651\n00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.590\nRelevant gaps against\nspecified frameworks, and or\n\n652\n00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.120\nstandards, have to be identified,\nthey are typically, as part of an audit.\n\n653\n00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.510\nAnd we have to then go through\na very predefined, and\n\n654\n00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.880\nwell understood set of\nstages to do a gap analysis.\n\n655\n00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.120\nThere actually are 13 distinct steps or\nstages we engage in.\n\n656\n00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.010\nYou've been kind enough to write\nthose down for me sir I believe.\n\n657\n00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.140\nIf we cold take a look at those,\nas soon as Daniel is ready.\n\n658\n00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.642\nThat would not quite be the ones we want,\nbut he will pull them up in just second.\n\n659\n00:32:49.642 --> 00:32:50.448\n>> I'm sorry.\nThere they are.\n\n660\n00:32:50.448 --> 00:32:51.624\n>> There they are.\nThat's the one.\n\n661\n00:32:51.624 --> 00:32:54.638\nI should have said the blue list,\nbut it was the yellow list.\n\n662\n00:32:54.638 --> 00:32:56.544\n>> I know exactly that's the point.\n\n663\n00:32:56.544 --> 00:33:00.161\nSo we are looking at\nthe gap analysis stages.\n\n664\n00:33:00.161 --> 00:33:04.300\nWe want to make sure we have\na sense of are we taking a trip.\n\n665\n00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.860\n>> I'm trying to zoom it in for\nyou there we go, there we go.\n\n666\n00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.820\n>> And instead you zoomed out.\n\n667\n00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.050\n>> Yeah.\n>> Congratulations sir, awesome job,\n\n668\n00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.940\nawesome job that zooming.\n\n669\n00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.130\nAll right,\nit's that whole double tap finger thing.\n\n670\n00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:15.950\n>> It's the Macbook.\n\n671\n00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.030\n>> It's a Mac thing.\n\n672\n00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:18.690\nWe'll just call it a Mac thing.\n\n673\n00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.870\n>> So the gap analysis status.\n\n674\n00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:24.400\nWe want to go through, want to make sure\nwe understand that when we're looking for\n\n675\n00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.310\nthese deltas, these differentials\nbetween the documented state that\n\n676\n00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:31.580\nwe should be achieving,\nthe regulatory compliance we need to have.\n\n677\n00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.950\nAnd the actuality of what\nwe're doing on the ground.\n\n678\n00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.550\nThat's what gap analysis is all about.\n\n679\n00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:39.480\nWe uncover the good, the bad and\nthe ugly as we say when we audit.\n\n680\n00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.620\nAnd we're gonna go through\na very detailed process.\n\n681\n00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.930\nWe wanna know as with any\nnumbered ordered procedure or\n\n682\n00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.560\nprocess list what these steps are,\nor stages.\n\n683\n00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:48.700\nWe wanna know them in order.\n\n684\n00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.120\nWanna understand what they are.\n\n685\n00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:50.800\nSo number one.\n\n686\n00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.900\nObtaining management support\nfrom the right managers,\n\n687\n00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.530\nor obtaining management\nsupport in general.\n\n688\n00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:58.690\nTo go out and do this from\nthe appropriate areas of the business.\n\n689\n00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.740\nWe always start with senior management or\nmanagement support.\n\n690\n00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.170\nIf we don't have that, we really\ndon't have the right to do anything.\n\n691\n00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:07.860\nAnd if we have that, we have the blessing\nof the organization to go out and\n\n692\n00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:11.540\nengage in the activities required to\nfigure out what it is we need to achieve.\n\n693\n00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.670\nManagement support is paramount.\n\n694\n00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.230\nIt is the most important\nthing we achieve and look for\n\n695\n00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.850\nwith regards to this kinda stuff.\n\n696\n00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.370\nNo management support, no activities.\n\n697\n00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.190\nThat's very, very important to understand.\n\n698\n00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.770\nDefining scope and objectives,\nwe have to lay out clearly\n\n699\n00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.510\nonce we have management support, what\nthe expectation of the coverage will be.\n\n700\n00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.680\nWhat our goals are.\n\n701\n00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.690\nIn other words by doing that we're\nexcluding what we're not gonna cover and\n\n702\n00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:35.780\nwhat we're not gonna achieve by also\ntalking about what we will cover and\n\n703\n00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.050\nwhat we will achieve.\n\n704\n00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:38.680\nRight, so want to make sure we know that.\n\n705\n00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:40.260\nAssessment schedule and planning.\n\n706\n00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.590\nWe've gotta lay out a very detailed\ncalendar of what we're gonna do when how\n\n707\n00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.060\nlong it's gonna take, and what it's gonna\ntake to do it what resources we need.\n\n708\n00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.565\nWe then need to seek\nagreement on the plan.\n\n709\n00:34:49.565 --> 00:34:50.165\nWe need to go out and\n\n710\n00:34:50.165 --> 00:34:53.365\nget everybody involved to agree that our\nplan is gonna be the best way to proceed.\n\n711\n00:34:53.365 --> 00:34:55.165\nIt's gonna be very important to do that.\n\n712\n00:34:55.165 --> 00:34:57.535\nConduct the information\ngathering exercises.\n\n713\n00:34:57.535 --> 00:35:02.332\nThat's fancy speak for essentially linking\nto number six, interviewing key personnel.\n\n714\n00:35:02.332 --> 00:35:05.302\nWhich together is essentially just\nrequirements gathering, right?\n\n715\n00:35:05.302 --> 00:35:06.122\nWe're going out.\n\n716\n00:35:06.122 --> 00:35:06.692\nWe're looking at.\n\n717\n00:35:06.692 --> 00:35:07.332\nWe're interviewing.\n\n718\n00:35:07.332 --> 00:35:08.142\nWe're talking.\n\n719\n00:35:08.142 --> 00:35:08.952\nWe're seeing.\n\n720\n00:35:08.952 --> 00:35:09.712\nWe're examining.\n\n721\n00:35:09.712 --> 00:35:10.592\nWe're trying.\n\n722\n00:35:10.592 --> 00:35:12.142\nWe're taking pictures, right?\n\n723\n00:35:12.142 --> 00:35:13.132\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n724\n00:35:13.132 --> 00:35:14.526\nAll that's part of that.\n\n725\n00:35:14.526 --> 00:35:17.596\nStep seven, review evidence and\nor supporting documentation.\n\n726\n00:35:17.596 --> 00:35:19.856\nSo we've got to review\nwhat we've already found.\n\n727\n00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:21.916\nKind of go through that, gather it all up.\n\n728\n00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:24.416\nNumber eight,\nverification of information obtained.\n\n729\n00:35:24.416 --> 00:35:27.296\nWe've got to cross reference what\nwe found to ensure it's valid.\n\n730\n00:35:27.296 --> 00:35:31.301\nJust because you hand me a piece of paper\nthat says server five is on IP address\n\n731\n00:35:31.301 --> 00:35:33.156\n1921680.5 doesn't mean it is.\n\n732\n00:35:33.156 --> 00:35:35.750\nIt doesn't mean it isn't.\n\n733\n00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.980\nBut it doesn't mean it is.\n\n734\n00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.668\nI have to go and ping that server,\nI have to go login to it.\n\n735\n00:35:39.668 --> 00:35:43.418\nI have to go validate that that really\nis the case so I can write that down and\n\n736\n00:35:43.418 --> 00:35:46.383\nsay yes as of 10:00 in\nthe morning on October 23rd,\n\n737\n00:35:46.383 --> 00:35:49.640\nthat IP was valid for\nthat machine whatever that may be.\n\n738\n00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.980\nIdentification of risks and\npotential risks, we have to take a look at\n\n739\n00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.170\neverything we've found up until now and\nstart assessing whether or\n\n740\n00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:00.160\nnot our checklist of items that have to\nbe dealt with is indeed being addressed.\n\n741\n00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.260\nIf it is, that risk is being managed.\n\n742\n00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:05.270\nIf it's not, it's a big red circle\nwe put around it so we say hey,\n\n743\n00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.780\nwe're not dealing with this, right?\n\n744\n00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:07.720\nWe gotta know.\n\n745\n00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.260\nThen we gotta document our findings.\n\n746\n00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:11.450\nThat's gonna be publishing it all up,\nwriting it up.\n\n747\n00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:14.287\nOne of the things we often\nhave to make sure we do, and\n\n748\n00:36:14.287 --> 00:36:17.653\nI've talked about before,\nalthough it's not listed here.\n\n749\n00:36:17.653 --> 00:36:20.908\nSo you may want to make a little\nmental note next to document findings,\n\n750\n00:36:20.908 --> 00:36:22.990\nis ensure they are audience relevant.\n\n751\n00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:27.335\nIf we're going to be presenting these to\nthe sea level, make sure they are not 20,\n\n752\n00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:31.485\n30 40 to 50 pages of deep technical\ndocumentation and jargon, right?\n\n753\n00:36:31.485 --> 00:36:33.130\n>> Um-hm.\n>> Cause they just may not care.\n\n754\n00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:36.630\nIf you're presenting it to a bunch of\nnetwork managers that do routing for\n\n755\n00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.800\na living,\nthey're gonna want that level of detail.\n\n756\n00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.460\nWhat do you mean we have a risk\nassociated with multipath routing?\n\n757\n00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.220\nCuz we're using spanning tree\nalgorithm on our second and third hop.\n\n758\n00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.650\nHow do you justify that?\n\n759\n00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.320\nAnd then give me all that detail.\n\n760\n00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.920\nAbsolutely, that's what I want.\n\n761\n00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.630\nBut if I'm talking to\nthe CEO of the company,\n\n762\n00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.223\nI lost it when I said,\nwe have a routing problem.\n\n763\n00:36:54.223 --> 00:36:55.458\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He or she is gone,\n\n764\n00:36:55.458 --> 00:36:56.870\nthey've already checked out.\n\n765\n00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:58.050\n>> He's on Facebook at that point.\n\n766\n00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:00.900\n>> He's doing something else but he's not\npaying attention to me cuz he pays people\n\n767\n00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.800\nto deal with that stuff or she does.\n\n768\n00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.510\nAnd if neither one of them is\ngonna really be interested.\n\n769\n00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:08.240\nFor the most part, I'm being overly\ngeneral and I'm certainly being very,\n\n770\n00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:13.180\nvery high level in my\nbroad brush strokes here,\n\n771\n00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.310\nabout tarring everybody\nwith the same brush.\n\n772\n00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:19.560\nThere are many CEOs, and many senior level\nmanagers, who are very technical, right.\n\n773\n00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.850\nAnd we should hopefully know that,\nand acknowledge that by the way.\n\n774\n00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.800\nIt's very important.\n\n775\n00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:25.850\nBut there are many who are just not for\na variety of reasons.\n\n776\n00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:28.220\nAnd if they're not that hands on manager,\nis my point,\n\n777\n00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:32.100\nif they're not that technical person,\ndon't give them that level of detail.\n\n778\n00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.090\nNot because they don't necessarily want it\nor need it, but at the time it's probably\n\n779\n00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:39.600\nnot relevant unless you spend an hour\nwith them to help them to understand it.\n\n780\n00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.460\nSo give them the appropriate level\nbased on the audience that you're gonna\n\n781\n00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.250\nreport to.\n\n782\n00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.360\nDevelopment of reporting and\n\n783\n00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.840\nrecommendations, presentation of report,\nthat whole group 10,\n\n784\n00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.830\n11 and 12 is all gonna be tempered by\nthat audience relevancy conversation.\n\n785\n00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.740\nAnd then sign-off/acceptance of report,\nvery important, this is where we circle\n\n786\n00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.710\nback to senior management,\nall the way back to point number one.\n\n787\n00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:02.540\nWe link those two together because\nsenior management has to sign off on and\n\n788\n00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.405\naccept the signing of the report.\n\n789\n00:38:04.405 --> 00:38:06.765\nOtherwise unfortunately\nthey're just not valid.\n\n790\n00:38:06.765 --> 00:38:08.935\nThey exist, they're there,\nwe know we have a problem.\n\n791\n00:38:08.935 --> 00:38:10.215\nBut if they're not willing to sign off and\n\n792\n00:38:10.215 --> 00:38:12.345\naccept them they're not\nbeing acknowledged, and\n\n793\n00:38:12.345 --> 00:38:13.605\nthat is certainly an issue and\n\n794\n00:38:13.605 --> 00:38:18.035\na concern that we have to think about and\nsomehow bring to light and be aware of.\n\n795\n00:38:18.035 --> 00:38:23.005\nSo we have to understand how to do gap\nanalysis and walk through these stages.\n\n796\n00:38:23.005 --> 00:38:26.449\nAs a CCSP it's gonna be very important for\nus to be aware of this and\n\n797\n00:38:26.449 --> 00:38:28.967\nto internalize this part\nof the conversation.\n\n798\n00:38:28.967 --> 00:38:32.509\nSo that we have a detailed road map\nabout how we're going to show up and\n\n799\n00:38:32.509 --> 00:38:35.642\nengage in an audit, and\nthe kind of reports we may generate.\n\n800\n00:38:35.642 --> 00:38:39.528\nThe reasons why those reports would\nbe relevant to certain audiences, and\n\n801\n00:38:39.528 --> 00:38:43.737\nhow we are going to use the gap analysis\nprocess to drive the ultimate reporting.\n\n802\n00:38:43.737 --> 00:38:46.779\nIn terms of the analysis\nof the information and\n\n803\n00:38:46.779 --> 00:38:51.381\nultimately the verification validation and\nfeedback to the customer\n\n804\n00:38:51.381 --> 00:38:55.210\non what we're looking to do so\nwe can get them to accept it.\n\n805\n00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:58.350\nAnd then we can enact changes as\na result of that to risk manage.\n\n806\n00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:00.200\nIn the organization.\n\n807\n00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.050\n>> Well Adam, there's obviously\na lot of nuances and guidelines and\n\n808\n00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.870\nstipulations that come into play when it\ncomes to auditing, and if you've ever been\n\n809\n00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:10.340\na part of an audit all this stuff is\nactually making a lot of sense to you.\n\n810\n00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:13.490\nIf you haven't, well then this is\nsomething that you really need to sink\n\n811\n00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:16.330\nyour teeth into because if\nyou're gonna get into security.\n\n812\n00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.390\nYou're gonna be a part of auditing,\nyou're going to be audited yourself,\n\n813\n00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:21.640\nyou're gonna do auditing,\nit's just gonna be a part of your life.\n\n814\n00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.500\nSo Just make that dive into the pool,\nif you're gonna get wet, might as\n\n815\n00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:30.510\nwell go swimming, and that's what I always\nsay, but we've got a lot more to cover.\n\n816\n00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.260\nLooks like we've take down\nthe clock on this episode, though.\n\n817\n00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:35.640\nAdam, we do thank you for\njoining us here today.\n\n818\n00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.014\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou in Part Two for this.\n\n819\n00:39:38.014 --> 00:39:39.790\nWe look forward to seeing\nyou there as well.\n\n820\n00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:41.540\nGonna go ahead and sign of as, as of now.\n\n821\n00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.400\nFor IT Pro TV, I've been your host,\nDaniel Lowery.\n\n822\n00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.760\n>> Are you sock one or sock two?\n\n823\n00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.690\n>> I'm sock three.\n\n824\n00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.120\n>> Sock three?\n>> I'm very generalized.\n\n825\n00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:48.685\n>> Very general.\n\n826\n00:39:48.685 --> 00:39:49.235\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> Okay.\n\n827\n00:39:49.235 --> 00:39:50.810\nI'm gonna be a sock two type two.\n\n828\n00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:51.420\n>> All right.\nAnd then.\n\n829\n00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.280\n>> I'll be operationally specific and\nimplementable.\n\n830\n00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.563\n>> And we'll see you sock\nones in the next episode.\n\n831\n00:39:55.563 --> 00:39:56.830\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> See you next time.\n\n832\n00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.652\n>> Take care, everybody.\n\n833\n00:39:58.652 --> 00:40:04.205\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:12.975\nanother great episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.200\nI'm your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n5\n00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.860\nAnd in today's episode, well you know it,\nwe are continuing on with our CCSP course.\n\n6\n00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.560\nOur Certified Cloud Security Professional\nseries.\n\n7\n00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.250\nJoining us,\nback in the studio again today,\n\n8\n00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.470\nwe've got a part two\ncoming about auditing.\n\n9\n00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.980\nIs our good friend, Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.770\nAdam, welcome back sir, how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.965\nGood, where is my chair?\n\n12\n00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:35.470\n[LAUGH].\nWhere's my chair?\n\n13\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.600\nWe talked about this,\nI'm supposed to have a chair.\n\n14\n00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.230\nThere's not, I'm standing,\nthere's no chair.\n\n15\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.785\nI'll talk to craft services and make sure\nthat you have the cold cuts you asked for.\n\n16\n00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:42.105\n[LAUGH].\n\n17\n00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:45.872\nYou know, you guys gotta get this stuff\ntogether, the green M&M's, the chair, and\n\n18\n00:00:45.872 --> 00:00:47.173\nthe dried apricots and figs.\n\n19\n00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:50.780\nSo none of that outside\nwhen I came in today.\n\n20\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.505\nI'm very upset.\n\n21\n00:00:51.505 --> 00:00:52.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Dynamite Valley\n\n22\n00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.900\nparking issue from last time when I was\nhere, which has still not been resolved.\n\n23\n00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.416\nGotta find Mike and\ntalk to him about that as well.\n\n24\n00:00:57.416 --> 00:00:58.116\n>> That's right.\n\n25\n00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:01.409\n>> All right, anyway, I am doing well and\nwe are here to talk not about all that\n\n26\n00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.580\nsilly inconsequential stuff,\n>> But rather about stuff that is really\n\n27\n00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.230\nimportant, stuff that regards us,\nor with our thought process.\n\n28\n00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.780\nIt helps us to understand really\nthe regard that we have for\n\n29\n00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.610\ninformation management within the cloud.\n\n30\n00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.813\nAnd we have to think of CCSP as about\nhow we're gonna approach not just\n\n31\n00:01:16.813 --> 00:01:19.465\nthe information we have,\nnot just the infrastructure,\n\n32\n00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:21.249\nnot just the business requirements.\n\n33\n00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.835\nBut as we talked about extensively in\nmany episodes, the holistic package,\n\n34\n00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.810\nall the things we do and\nhow we're gonna approach them.\n\n35\n00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.378\nWe think about this with reference to\na concept that we've spoken about before,\n\n36\n00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:35.040\nsomething known as the ISMS, the\nInformation Security Management System.\n\n37\n00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.520\nThis idea of the over arching\nthought process that helps us to\n\n38\n00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.190\nencompass all the key areas, and\nthen manage them accordingly.\n\n39\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.497\nWe have ISO standards and guidance for\nthe architecture, the design,\n\n40\n00:01:46.497 --> 00:01:50.087\nthe implementation, and\nthe management and oversight and\n\n41\n00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:54.849\ncontrol elements of the ISMS,\nwith both ISO 27,001 and 27,002.\n\n42\n00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.720\nWe've mentioned these and\ntalked about these before.\n\n43\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.190\nThe ISMS overall helps us to reduce\nrisks related to both confidentiality,\n\n44\n00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.520\nintegrity, and availability, all three\npillars of the information security area\n\n45\n00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.210\nthat we focus on with regards to\ninformation and the supporting assets.\n\n46\n00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.828\nIt helps us to assure and provide as\nwe talked about in the last episode.\n\n47\n00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:18.146\nAnd confidence to our stakeholders\nthrough the management of risk,\n\n48\n00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:21.120\nthrough the identification of risk,\nthe assessment of it and\n\n49\n00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.840\nultimately the cataloging management\nof it down in the organization.\n\n50\n00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.670\nWe're gonna be talking about risk again,\nand\n\n51\n00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.580\nwe've already talked about it before but\nwe'll talk about it again.\n\n52\n00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.920\nAnd have a focal point in it in one of\nthe upcoming episodes in this area so\n\n53\n00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.650\nyou're obviously gonna wanna stay\ntuned and watch out for that.\n\n54\n00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.212\nBut we're not gonna speak\ndirectly about it right now.\n\n55\n00:02:36.212 --> 00:02:37.930\nInstead we're gonna stay\na little bit broader,\n\n56\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.930\nwe're gonna talk about what the ISMS is\nand why it's important, the value of it.\n\n57\n00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.506\nCan we quickly go to the 27001 ISO?\n\n58\n00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:49.929\nI know you don't have that one but\nyou have like all the others,\n\n59\n00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.500\nlike the ten others I asked you to put up.\n\n60\n00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.910\nBut we'll give Daniel a second to just\ngo ahead and Google for and pull up\n\n61\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.170\nISO 27001, I just want to show it to you\nquickly, let you see what it looks like.\n\n62\n00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.880\nBut remember the value of the ISMS\nis really the structured,\n\n63\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.550\nmeasured, formal way in which we're going\nto be able to envision and ultimately then\n\n64\n00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.610\nmanage the assets, the infrastructure,\nand the information regarding\n\n65\n00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.840\nthe information that we have and we\nare responsible for in the organization.\n\n66\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.700\nWe could see ISO 27001 there,\ninformation security management.\n\n67\n00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.198\nIf we zoom in just a little bit I believe\nwe can actually read some of the detailed\n\n68\n00:03:23.198 --> 00:03:24.958\ntitle and verbiage there underneath.\n\n69\n00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:28.203\nAnd we can see the ISO\n27000 family overall and\n\n70\n00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:30.846\nit talks about all the different areas and\n\n71\n00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:35.710\nthen it drills down specifically and\ntells us about ISO 27001 113.\n\n72\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.200\n>> Right down below there,\nit says, what is an ISMS.\n\n73\n00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.920\nAnd then below that, it lets us preview\nthe 27, there's the Lego Playland again,\n\n74\n00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.320\nand it lets us preview all of,\nyou know what that stuff reminds me of?\n\n75\n00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.030\nWhen I was a kid and I had the magnets on\nthe fridge, you know the letter magnets?\n\n76\n00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.440\n>> Yeah, I have them, yeah.\n\n77\n00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.260\nI do too.\n[LAUGH] But you would have those,\n\n78\n00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.710\nand if you put that back up for a second,\n\n79\n00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.390\nthey actually, they actually were\nbasically like that but bigger versions.\n\n80\n00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.710\nAnd you would stick them up and\nthey would just be so cool to play with,\n\n81\n00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.190\nall the different bright colors.\n\n82\n00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.190\nEvery time I see that flash up,\nI keep thinking about that.\n\n83\n00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.280\nThat is so cool.\n\n84\n00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.117\nAnyways, so we can see ISO 27001.\n\n85\n00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:16.068\nAnd the preview, the link to it and\nwe obviously can go in,\n\n86\n00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:17.690\nwe can take a look at it.\n\n87\n00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.070\nWe've shown them that before, I think we\nhave a reason to go to the preview but\n\n88\n00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.948\nwe also want to quickly do ISO 27002.\n\n89\n00:04:22.948 --> 00:04:26.678\nWe're going to do that just\nwhile we're talking and\n\n90\n00:04:26.678 --> 00:04:32.740\nessentially ISO 27002 is going to be\nthe control elements for ISO 27001.\n\n91\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.050\nSo with ICER 27001, we're talking about\nthe architecture, overview the structure\n\n92\n00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.270\nand the do's and don'ts with\nregards to implementing the ISMS.\n\n93\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.220\n270002 gives us the controls or\nthat allow us to actually figure out\n\n94\n00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.990\nhow to provide the security\nfunctionality we need.\n\n95\n00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.990\nSo we use two together our\nessentiall joined at the hip.\n\n96\n00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.538\nWe wanna make sure we understand this and\nunderstand the ISO 27001 document.\n\n97\n00:04:58.538 --> 00:05:01.420\nThere are what we call domains or\nfocal areas.\n\n98\n00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.390\nWe have a total of 14 of\nthem that are gonna make\n\n99\n00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.590\nthe focal areas that we\nwill build the ISMS around.\n\n100\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.650\nThese, in no particular order, are gonna\nbe information security policies,\n\n101\n00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.130\norganization of information security,\nhuman resource security assets management,\n\n102\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.150\noperations security physical and\nenvironmental security,\n\n103\n00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.090\ncryptography, access control,\ncommunication security.\n\n104\n00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.246\nStop me when I'm getting warm.\n\n105\n00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:26.900\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Stop me when you hear\n\n106\n00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.430\nsomething you would like.\n\n107\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.321\nSystem acquisition, development and\nmaintenance, supplier relationships,\n\n108\n00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:35.220\nincident management,\nbusiness continuity management.\n\n109\n00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.598\nTalked a lot about that in one of\nour prior episodes, and compliance.\n\n110\n00:05:38.598 --> 00:05:43.535\nSo these are the 14 key vocal\nareas that an iso 27001\n\n111\n00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:48.306\nrelay out as the domains\nthat iso 27001 speaks to.\n\n112\n00:05:48.306 --> 00:05:50.810\nAnd then in 27002, we have the controls\n\n113\n00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.340\nthat are going to be stipulated in\nevery one of these domain areas.\n\n114\n00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.910\nThat will make up the implementation\nelements that we actually use to recognize\n\n115\n00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.790\nand build out the ISMS and\n\n116\n00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.640\nto implement it according to\nguide instead of just provide it.\n\n117\n00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.540\nSo we have to think about the fact\nthat these two documents together.\n\n118\n00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.640\nAllow us to build essentially the building\nblocks and elements of the ESA\n\n119\n00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.370\nthe enterprise security architecture\nat least the majority of it anyway.\n\n120\n00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.821\nWe need repeatability,\n\n121\n00:06:14.821 --> 00:06:19.517\nwe need standardization with regards to\nthis stuff so we want to be thinking about\n\n122\n00:06:19.517 --> 00:06:24.298\nthe fact that one of the key things\nISO both 27001 and 27002 to do for us.\n\n123\n00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:29.410\nIs to give us a standardize template, a\nblueprint that allows us to build the ISMS\n\n124\n00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.768\naccording to these key categories that are\nof critical importance to us to focus on.\n\n125\n00:06:34.768 --> 00:06:38.088\nAnd the controls that will standardize\nthe way we operate and manage them.\n\n126\n00:06:38.088 --> 00:06:41.063\nSo that every time we do this,\nwe're doing it according to and\n\n127\n00:06:41.063 --> 00:06:44.616\naligned with the best practise guidance,\nthe regulatory compliance and\n\n128\n00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:47.120\nthe recommendations\nthat we need to follow.\n\n129\n00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.650\nSo this becomes very important.\n\n130\n00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.100\nWe standardize and we measure by using\n\n131\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.540\nimplementation guidance like this\nin order to be able to manage.\n\n132\n00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.910\nAnd also to create the environments\nthat we need with regards to\n\n133\n00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.670\ninformation confidentiality protections,\ninformation integrity protections, and\n\n134\n00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.740\ninformation availability protections.\n\n135\n00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.880\nRight, so we can take that down for\na moment.\n\n136\n00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.140\nThere are some other\nISO pages we'll go to.\n\n137\n00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.050\nI know you have them loaded up.\n\n138\n00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.720\nWe'll be taking a look at them shortly.\n\n139\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.580\nWe wanna think about\nthe value of policies.\n\n140\n00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.100\nWe've talked a lot about policy.\n\n141\n00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.580\nPolicy is going to be a high\nlevel statement of intent.\n\n142\n00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.110\nFor a strategic alignment that stipulates\nand states for us what the business is\n\n143\n00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.670\nlooking to accomplish, the business\nrequirements, the goals if you will.\n\n144\n00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.220\nAnd then we leave the implementation\ndetails to process and procedure.\n\n145\n00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.550\nSo policies are very important.\n\n146\n00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.790\nThey help us to implement effective\ndata security strategies.\n\n147\n00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.060\nThey essentially create the connectors\nthat hold all of our data\n\n148\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.820\nsecurity elements together by stating\nwhat it is we're looking to accomplish.\n\n149\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.161\nAnd then giving us clear direction on\nthe fact that that will be an important\n\n150\n00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:48.942\nrequirement for us to realize as part of\nthe security architecture in the business.\n\n151\n00:07:48.942 --> 00:07:51.741\nAnd to help us understand\nhow to consume in the cloud\n\n152\n00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:56.050\nsecurely because we identify the key\ncritical elements that have to managed.\n\n153\n00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.576\nWe have different levels of policies,\nall sorts of different kinds of policies.\n\n154\n00:07:59.576 --> 00:08:01.551\nWe may have organizational policies.\n\n155\n00:08:01.551 --> 00:08:03.620\nWe may have security policies.\n\n156\n00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.390\nWe may have a variety of different\npolicies in different areas.\n\n157\n00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.680\nBut we wanna make sure that we use\npolicies as a risk management tool.\n\n158\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.860\nSpecifically a risk reduction tool.\n\n159\n00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.690\nBecause by identifying\nthe key elements that\n\n160\n00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.440\nthe business is looking to accomplish.\n\n161\n00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.100\nBy laying out in a clear concise and\ncoherent form and\n\n162\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.720\na standardized way that everybody can\nequally relate to and consume from.\n\n163\n00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.630\nWhat the goals of the business will be,\nwe are equalizing the playing field we're\n\n164\n00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.670\nsaying we're going to put our time\nenergy and effort into these pursuits,\n\n165\n00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.140\nwe're not going to work about these\nother things so let's focus on these and\n\n166\n00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.960\nas a result we're going to reduce risk in\nthe organization by doing those things.\n\n167\n00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.270\nSo it's very very important for\nus to consider the value of policies.\n\n168\n00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:49.300\nI know that in many organizations right,\nwe will tend to have a very large number\n\n169\n00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:54.420\nof policies, policies about mobile device\nmanagement, about social media today.\n\n170\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.520\nPretty important cloud related policy.\n\n171\n00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.790\nWe may have policies with regards to\nthe use of external cloud services right?\n\n172\n00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.310\nWhether or not we're allowed individually\n\n173\n00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.100\nthrough the business\nto contract with them.\n\n174\n00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.870\nWe call that shadow IT.\n\n175\n00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.000\nSo, weather or not we're gonna\nallow shadow IT to occur, and if so\n\n176\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.170\nunder what conditions.\n\n177\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.960\nWe may have policies relating to\nthe use of external devices or\n\n178\n00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.870\nplatforms to consume corporate data,\nwhether we allow that or not.\n\n179\n00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.340\nWe may have policies about the use\nof corporate resources in general.\n\n180\n00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.030\nThe expectation of privacy.\n\n181\n00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.130\nThere's all sorts of things\nthat policies will speak to but\n\n182\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.120\nin general they should be viewed, and\n\n183\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:35.174\nas CCSPs we should be thinking about\npolicies, as a risk-reduction technique,\n\n184\n00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:38.675\nessentially as a risk management tool,\nbecause that's what they are.\n\n185\n00:09:38.675 --> 00:09:43.195\nWe should have cloud computing specific\npolicies related to the use of cloud.\n\n186\n00:09:43.195 --> 00:09:46.235\nSpecifying the use of cloud technologies,\n\n187\n00:09:46.235 --> 00:09:50.252\nspecifying the need to understand\nthem now, as we already spoke about.\n\n188\n00:09:50.252 --> 00:09:52.302\nWhat's our position on social media?\n\n189\n00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:56.062\nWhat's our position on allowing for\nthird party outsourcing,\n\n190\n00:09:56.062 --> 00:09:59.252\nmeaning the use of Shadow IT by one or\nmore individuals?\n\n191\n00:09:59.252 --> 00:10:03.676\nI love when I go to do audits,\nand we talked to various groups.\n\n192\n00:10:03.676 --> 00:10:06.586\nTypically the application developers\ntend to fall into this category,\n\n193\n00:10:06.586 --> 00:10:11.166\nwhere they will spin up external instances\nto do their app dev work on, you know,\n\n194\n00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:13.246\nAmazon, or whatever it may be.\n\n195\n00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:16.516\nThey'll go out for ten bucks a month,\nput down the corporate credit card,\n\n196\n00:10:16.516 --> 00:10:19.796\nspin up several instances, and\njust start, you know, developing.\n\n197\n00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:23.206\nAnd they wont think twice about it,\nand they'll, no problem,\n\n198\n00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:24.965\njust turn that in on their\nexpense report every month.\n\n199\n00:10:24.965 --> 00:10:26.730\n[LAUGH] Nobody pays attention.\n\n200\n00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.520\nNobody cares.\n\n201\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.470\nAnd it just gets passed up,\nand they pay it.\n\n202\n00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.390\nAnd nobody questions it.\n\n203\n00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.070\nAnd this is the thing that kills me.\n\n204\n00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:38.250\nAs an auditor, as a CCSP, as a CISSP,\nand everything else that I am,\n\n205\n00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.540\nit just goes against every fiber of being\nthat I have with regards to security.\n\n206\n00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.250\nHow do you allow an unregulated,\n\n207\n00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.370\nunstructured stream of data to\nexist outside the organization?\n\n208\n00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.850\nWithout regulating it without documenting,\nwithout knowing something about it that\n\n209\n00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:58.120\nmay very well be used to essentially\ncreate information, create structure code,\n\n210\n00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.550\ncreate data that will then be ported\nback to the organization without any\n\n211\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.410\nclear understanding of what the state\nof that data and that information is.\n\n212\n00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.350\nMeaning how do we know somebody didn't\nhack into that VM, modify it and\n\n213\n00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.990\nput malware in there, and\nthen you're bringing that code back in?\n\n214\n00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.440\nAnd when I ask those questions,\nnobody has a good answer.\n\n215\n00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.210\nWell, it's Amazon.\n\n216\n00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:18.210\nI mean, it's secure, right.\n\n217\n00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.160\nNobody's gonna get in there.\n\n218\n00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.980\nThey don't have our,\nthey don't have our encryption keys.\n\n219\n00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.680\nThey don't know our IP address.\n\n220\n00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.950\nAm I doing a really good,\nkind of, slacker voice for that?\n\n221\n00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.170\nAll right, because that's what\nI'm trying to achieve, right.\n\n222\n00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.110\nI mean, you know, think about that.\n\n223\n00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.680\nThe likelihood that that happens is,\nand they're probably right\n\n224\n00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.240\nin the sense that the likelihood\nis low that somebody will get in.\n\n225\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.770\nI didn't say it was zero,\nI said it was low.\n\n226\n00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:45.170\nAnd the problem is that under certain\nconditions somebody may be able to get in.\n\n227\n00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.380\nAnd even if they don't get in, somebody\nmay be able to at least observe the VM\n\n228\n00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.400\nmay be able to see and interact with\nit if we don't secure it properly.\n\n229\n00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.210\nThey may be able to tell what we're doing,\nexamine the code and understand what we're\n\n230\n00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.150\nabout to do in production which\ncould then lead to compromise.\n\n231\n00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.800\nIt's just not a good idea for\na lot of reasons.\n\n232\n00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.760\nIf you need that kind of infrastructure,\n\n233\n00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.870\nyou have to go through a formal\nchange management and approval and\n\n234\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:11.520\nacquisition process inside the\norganization to request those resources.\n\n235\n00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.670\nAnd this is one of the reasons why a lot\nof companies are moving towards on prem\n\n236\n00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.990\nprivate cloud today.\n\n237\n00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.460\nBecause they are understanding\nthat these things are happening,\n\n238\n00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.040\nShadow IT concerns are bubbling up.\n\n239\n00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.060\nAnd instead of having all this hidden\ninfrastructure we don't directly\n\n240\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.030\ncontrol running.\n\n241\n00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.850\nWe'd rather have the ability for you to\ncome ask us, and provide it to you, but\n\n242\n00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:29.660\ncontrol it.\n\n243\n00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.830\nAnd so as a result,\nwe're trying to do these things.\n\n244\n00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.390\nSo we should have policies that deal\nwith password policies, remote access,\n\n245\n00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.610\nencryption, third party access,\nsegregation of duties,\n\n246\n00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.920\nincident management, data backup.\n\n247\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:46.030\nThese are all cloud specific policies that\nwe would need to think about as CCSP's\n\n248\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:49.750\nimplement in theory and understand how to\nmanage or at least understand how to defy.\n\n249\n00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.220\nWhat about revision of policies\nhow often should we revisit and\n\n250\n00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:54.990\ntherefore review policies?\n\n251\n00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.020\nWhen you were at the bureau.\n\n252\n00:12:58.220 --> 00:12:59.870\nHow often do you guys\nreview your policies?\n\n253\n00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.670\nWas it once a year?\n\n254\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.880\n>> Yeah I think we did it once a year.\n\n255\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.090\n>> Yeah, once a year okay.\n\n256\n00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:07.730\nSo you know when you do it once a year,\nsorry I have a little itchy nose here.\n\n257\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:12.150\nAs we do it once a year and maybe even\nmore than once a year, maybe twice a year.\n\n258\n00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.590\nIt really kind of depends on\nthe policy and what you're doing.\n\n259\n00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.160\nYou're goal there is to review it.\n\n260\n00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.450\nIf you did it once a year that's great.\n\n261\n00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:21.520\nIf you do it more than once a year okay so\nmuch the better maybe better maybe not,\n\n262\n00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.530\nat least you're doing it.\n\n263\n00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.570\nThe challenge we have is\nthat if you don't do it,\n\n264\n00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.990\nif you do it once every three years,\ndo it every five, or\n\n265\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:31.770\njust don't do it all that really\ntends to present an issue.\n\n266\n00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.710\nBecause the policy over time is\ngoing to diverge, right, from\n\n267\n00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.820\nthe reality of the systems it was designed\nto manage and ultimately to oversee.\n\n268\n00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.300\nAnd we're saying now,\nyeah we want the policy to be this and\n\n269\n00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.950\nwe want the system to be used this way.\n\n270\n00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.690\nBut in one year, maybe it's like this.\n\n271\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.470\nIn two years, maybe it's like this.\n\n272\n00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.860\nAnd if we don't at some point review and\nkinda lose the gap, or\n\n273\n00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.720\nassert that there is no gap cuz\nit's still perfectly aligned.\n\n274\n00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.470\nWe're not sure what's happening there.\n\n275\n00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.620\nSo we have to think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n276\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.010\nWe should obviously be reviewing\nthese things on a regular basis.\n\n277\n00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:06.270\nI love, again, when I go to audit\ncompanies and I ask to see their current\n\n278\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.120\nactive list of policies and we get a list,\nwe get a playbook, whatever it is, and\n\n279\n00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.900\nwe find odd policies that have no\nbaring on the business anymore.\n\n280\n00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.240\nLike you know a policy that\ncovers fax machines and\n\n281\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.780\nwe haven't had a fax\nmachine in five years.\n\n282\n00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.760\nOr a policy that governs the use of, what\n\n283\n00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:30.870\nwas one I just saw recently,\nyeah the use of modems on mobile devices.\n\n284\n00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.200\nAnd we don't have any devices anymore in\nthe device pool that have modems in them.\n\n285\n00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.460\nWhen was the last time you saw\na brand-new laptop that has a modem.\n\n286\n00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.330\nI mean you can find them but\n\n287\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.250\nit's not like every laptop you buy\ncomes with a modem these days.\n\n288\n00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.850\nA lot of them don't.\n\n289\n00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:49.540\nI saw one for floppy drive users\nwhich is not as crazy as it sounds,\n\n290\n00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.890\nbecause there may be certain\nlegitimate reasons why in older systems\n\n291\n00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.970\nyou may still need access\nto a floppy drive.\n\n292\n00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.930\nBut again, on the modern mobile platform,\nI can't remember the last\n\n293\n00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:02.550\ntime I saw a floppy disk on a normal\nlaptop that was in production.\n\n294\n00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.820\nSo these are things that we\nmay see if we do a review.\n\n295\n00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.670\nLaughable though they are at some\npoint we still wanna understand and\n\n296\n00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.850\nobviously get rid of them if we no longer\nhave a reason to have them around.\n\n297\n00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:12.940\nSo think about that.\n\n298\n00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:15.490\nMake sure that the relevant\nstakeholders are being consulted so\n\n299\n00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.790\nthat policies will be aligned with\nthe business requirements and the needs.\n\n300\n00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.950\nAnd that we're validating them.\n\n301\n00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:22.050\nIt's also very important\nto think about that.\n\n302\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.050\nBut how do we identify\nthe right stakeholders?\n\n303\n00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.000\nHow do we know who the senior\nmanagers are that should be asked?\n\n304\n00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.680\nHow do we know who's\ninvolved with the cloud?\n\n305\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.550\nHow do we know who to ask for\nthe business requirements, right?\n\n306\n00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:32.590\nIt's hard sometimes.\n\n307\n00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.320\nWe're just not sure.\n\n308\n00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.670\nDo we ask all the C level executives?\n\n309\n00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:40.300\nDo we ask the line managers that\nare managing the individual systems\n\n310\n00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:41.140\nand the data?\n\n311\n00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.140\nAre we asking the Cloud provider because\nthey're essentially now a stakeholder\n\n312\n00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:45.900\nin our system?\n\n313\n00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.730\nAnd people often forget to\ntalk to the Cloud provider.\n\n314\n00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.952\nThe Cloud provider is not\ngoing to have much to say.\n\n315\n00:15:50.952 --> 00:15:53.610\nAnd when I say talk to them I\ndon't mean knock on the door and\n\n316\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.445\ntalk to somebody at the help desk and\nopen up a service ticket.\n\n317\n00:15:56.445 --> 00:16:00.121\nWhat I mean is, have you gone out and\nread the policies and all the things that\n\n318\n00:16:00.121 --> 00:16:04.480\nthe cloud provider is offering you and the\nstipulations in your hosting agreements?\n\n319\n00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:07.540\nAnd have you essentially incorporated\nthat into your policies?\n\n320\n00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.250\nCuz that's their statement of\nwhat they're willing to do,\n\n321\n00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.630\nwhat they're willing to support,\nwhat they're willing to give you.\n\n322\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:16.530\nYou've gotta incorporate that\nknowledge into your policies,\n\n323\n00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.410\nbecause that's gonna be essentially\nhow you're gonna manage going forward,\n\n324\n00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.000\nat least while you're on that platform.\n\n325\n00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.830\nThere are many governance challenges\nas we know that we have to address.\n\n326\n00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:27.450\nAuditability, as we've spoken about\nextensively, is a major concern here.\n\n327\n00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.560\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n328\n00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.350\nEstablishing reporting and\ncommunication pathways, so\n\n329\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.440\nwe can do things like get a SOC report and\nprovide it to our customers, right?\n\n330\n00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.260\nSo how do we get that\nSOC 3 report out there?\n\n331\n00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.830\nHow do we put it up on that webpage and\nmake it available?\n\n332\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.130\nWe'd have to think about that.\n\n333\n00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:46.590\nHow do internal customers, internal\nbusiness units, request a SOC 1 report?\n\n334\n00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.990\nHow do they get that, right?\n\n335\n00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.370\nHow does that come about?\n\n336\n00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.840\nWe gotta have a process for\nthat, we gotta understand that.\n\n337\n00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.660\nDo we have all of our regulatory and\nlegal obligations stipulated for\n\n338\n00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.550\nall of our vendors?\n\n339\n00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:57.950\nAre we signing NDAs?\n\n340\n00:16:57.950 --> 00:16:59.390\nAre they signing them with us?\n\n341\n00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:02.010\nAre we binding them to make sure\nthat they're not gonna go out and\n\n342\n00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:03.710\ntalk about all the stuff they see?\n\n343\n00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:07.110\nThat's the kind of stuff we also have\nto think about, and that policy and\n\n344\n00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.560\ngovernance can help us to\nunderstand how to manage.\n\n345\n00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:14.060\nAs CCSPs, there's a lot of common sense\nstuff that we do outside the cloud,\n\n346\n00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.600\nthat has to be just ported\nright over to the cloud.\n\n347\n00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.980\nAnd it operates perhaps in a slightly\ndifferent way, because there's an approach\n\n348\n00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.080\nissue in the sense that we don't\nhave the same level of access.\n\n349\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.600\nBut the concept's the same, and\n\n350\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.970\nultimately the output and the outcome\nhas to be managed the same way.\n\n351\n00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.760\nWe don't, in other words, forget about all\nthe good stuff we know, all the security\n\n352\n00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.680\ncommon sense we have outside of the cloud,\njust because we operate in the cloud.\n\n353\n00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.560\nIt's a very important thought process for\nall of us to consider and\n\n354\n00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.720\nto think about, right?\n\n355\n00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.885\nCommon sense is still common sense, and\n\n356\n00:17:41.885 --> 00:17:45.540\nyou gotta apply it no matter where\nyou are, at least you should anyway.\n\n357\n00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:48.360\nWe see evidence of the contrary on\na regular basis, unfortunately.\n\n358\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.190\nBut you should try, [LAUGH] To do\nthat if at all possible, right?\n\n359\n00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.430\nIt's very, very important.\n\n360\n00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.865\nWe talked about Shadow IT.\n\n361\n00:17:53.865 --> 00:17:56.670\nWe’ve talked about\nthe globalization effects of cloud.\n\n362\n00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.073\nWe've talked about the distribution\neffects of broadly sprinkling\n\n363\n00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:03.364\nthe infrastructure around everywhere and\nmaking it ubiquitous.\n\n364\n00:18:03.364 --> 00:18:05.665\nBut we have to control that,\nthere still has to be a boundary,\n\n365\n00:18:05.665 --> 00:18:07.300\nthere still has to be a border.\n\n366\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.290\nEverywhere is not truly everywhere.\n\n367\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:13.100\nThere are exception and exclusion zones,\nand we have to understand what those are.\n\n368\n00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.654\nWe have to clearly communicate and provide\ncontext and direction for our users and\n\n369\n00:18:17.654 --> 00:18:22.208\nfor everybody that is in the cloud, so\nthat they understand what the expectations\n\n370\n00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:25.770\nof operation, of management,\nand of consumption are.\n\n371\n00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:27.480\nYet we have to have,\nin other words, rules of the game.\n\n372\n00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.820\nYou can't just simply jump into\nthe cloud and not have a playbook, and\n\n373\n00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:36.830\nnot have a set of rules that help us\ncoordinate, manage all our activities,\n\n374\n00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.500\nand ultimately frame the conversation that\nwe're gonna have, both in the cloud and\n\n375\n00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.860\nthrough the cloud, with our customers and\nwith the organization and the business.\n\n376\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.540\nGovernance, in other words,\nand compliance activities,\n\n377\n00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.000\nhave to be clearly communicated and\nexpectations have to be set.\n\n378\n00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.470\nWhen you were at the bureau, did you\nhave some sort of employee training, or\n\n379\n00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.440\nsome sort of security awareness that was\ndone that maybe, at least hopefully once\n\n380\n00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.310\na year, if not more than that, was done\nand you probably had to sign off on\n\n381\n00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.340\naccepting or getting an employee handbook\nwhen you first started, I would think.\n\n382\n00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.490\nIt's pretty common in\nmost businesses today.\n\n383\n00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.167\nDaniel's nodding knowingly\nas I'm saying all this.\n\n384\n00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:11.667\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] NDAs, yep.\n\n385\n00:19:11.667 --> 00:19:14.150\n>> I can say yes, absolutely, I did.\n\n386\n00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.070\nYou probably had NDAs and everything else,\n\n387\n00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.970\nand you know at the time you may not\nhave been heavily involved in the cloud.\n\n388\n00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:20.092\nThe company, in other words,\n\n389\n00:19:20.092 --> 00:19:23.015\nmay not have been cloud-centric.\nThey may have morphed over time and\n\n390\n00:19:23.015 --> 00:19:24.225\nthey may or may not be now,\n\n391\n00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:25.610\nwe have no way of knowing.\nBut\n\n392\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.104\nthe reality is whether they\nwere in the cloud or not,\n\n393\n00:19:28.104 --> 00:19:31.936\nthey did these common sense things, right?\nYou have them play handbooks full of\n\n394\n00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:35.596\npolicies, you have NDAs, you have codes\nof conduct, you have guidelines for\n\n395\n00:19:35.596 --> 00:19:38.792\nwhat you can and can't do.\nAll that stuff existed prior to the cloud,\n\n396\n00:19:38.792 --> 00:19:40.578\nright?\nComputers existed prior to the cloud,\n\n397\n00:19:40.578 --> 00:19:42.555\ncontrary to most people's beliefs.\n[LAUGH]\n\n398\n00:19:42.555 --> 00:19:43.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n399\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:43.833\n>> And you know the idea is\n\n400\n00:19:43.833 --> 00:19:46.770\nthat that stuff shouldn't change.\nIt should be applied the same way.\n\n401\n00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:48.874\nIf we know there's an issue and a concern,\n\n402\n00:19:48.874 --> 00:19:52.480\nwe should manage it with the most\nappropriate and most timely tools.\n\n403\n00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.890\nRegardless of the format,\n\n404\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.050\nregardless of the architecture,\nregardless of the platform.\n\n405\n00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.670\nSo we have to think about all these things\n\n406\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:02.480\nand make sure we are considering them.\nCoordination ultimately is the key to\n\n407\n00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.910\nsuccess here.\nGood communication, good expectation\n\n408\n00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.670\nsetting, good collaboration and\ntrust among our partners in the cloud, and\n\n409\n00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.400\namong our customers in and through\nthe cloud, and among our support system,\n\n410\n00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.360\nour vendors and our ecosystem,\nis gonna be critical.\n\n411\n00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.260\nBecause if one partner’s off doing\nsomething and we're not aware of what\n\n412\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:24.280\nthat is, that leads to confusion,\nconcern and consternation.\n\n413\n00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.967\nSo you don't want to have that happening,\nright?\n\n414\n00:20:25.967 --> 00:20:30.544\nBecause since the cloud is so far reaching\ntoday, it's so much easier to consume, but\n\n415\n00:20:30.544 --> 00:20:35.185\nit's also so much easier to misunderstand\nbecause there's so much more information,\n\n416\n00:20:35.185 --> 00:20:38.170\nand so\nmuch more access than traditional systems.\n\n417\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:41.650\nAnd we have to really play on both sides\nof that divide to understand that.\n\n418\n00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.140\nReporting is also gonna be critical,\nand we have to really understand\n\n419\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:50.370\nthe guidelines and the capabilities that\nare gonna help us, to not only keep track\n\n420\n00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:55.290\nof information, SOC 1, SOC 2, SOC 3\naudit reports, but also how to rank and\n\n421\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.340\nrate threat and vulnerabilities\nthat we may face in the cloud.\n\n422\n00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.986\nCan you go ahead and do a Google\nsearch for me real quick, good sir?\n\n423\n00:21:01.986 --> 00:21:03.641\n>> Sure.\n>> Can you look up common vulnerabilities\n\n424\n00:21:03.641 --> 00:21:04.521\nand exploits to CVE?\n\n425\n00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:07.638\nIt actually is mitre CVE,\nso M-I-T-R-E CVE,\n\n426\n00:21:07.638 --> 00:21:11.211\nthe common vulnerability and\nthe exploit and database.\n\n427\n00:21:11.211 --> 00:21:15.004\n>> Exploits and,\n>> You could probably do mitre,\n\n428\n00:21:15.004 --> 00:21:19.220\nM-I-T-R-E space C-V-E,\nCharlie, Victor, Echo.\n\n429\n00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:22.800\nYou'll probably get a link to the Common\nVulnerability Exploit database, right?\n\n430\n00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:25.333\nSo if you want to just bring that\nup real quick, we'll take a look.\n\n431\n00:21:25.333 --> 00:21:26.170\nThere we go.\n\n432\n00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.310\nSo if you're not familiar with this,\n\n433\n00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.972\nthis is another one of those areas\nthat as a cloud security professional,\n\n434\n00:21:30.972 --> 00:21:33.692\nlet me broaden that,\nas a security professional, but\n\n435\n00:21:33.692 --> 00:21:37.370\nespecially one focused on the cloud, you\nshould have a look at from time to time.\n\n436\n00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:41.300\nThis is a website that is maintained\nby the Mitre Corporation and\n\n437\n00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.710\nis gonna risk common vulnerabilities and\nexploits that are found out there and\n\n438\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.150\nare being propagated across multiple\nnetworks, not just cloud-related but\n\n439\n00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.050\ncertainly very cloud-focused.\n\n440\n00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.860\nSo the Mitre CVE site is important.\n\n441\n00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:55.600\nWhat about\nthe Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System?\n\n442\n00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.765\nThe CVSS, if you could,\nwhen you're done making a note real quick,\n\n443\n00:21:58.765 --> 00:22:00.579\nI didn't want to interrupt you there.\n\n444\n00:22:00.579 --> 00:22:03.812\nIf you could search for,\ndo a quick Google search for\n\n445\n00:22:03.812 --> 00:22:06.690\nCommon Vulnerability Scoring System.\n\n446\n00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:13.600\nSo Common Vulnerability Scoring System,\nso they're commonly called the CVSS.\n\n447\n00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.000\nYou'll probably, yeah, NVO,\nNVD whatever it is there, CVSS,\n\n448\n00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.660\nright, the National\nVulnerability Database.\n\n449\n00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.260\nSo this is maintained through NIST,\nas you can see.\n\n450\n00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.130\nThis is another great resource that\nwe should be taking a look at,\n\n451\n00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.470\nboth as a security and\nas a cloud security professional.\n\n452\n00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.450\nYou wanna be able to go out and take a\nlook at these sites, have a sense of them,\n\n453\n00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.470\nunderstand the kind of valuable\ninformation that will be there.\n\n454\n00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:36.830\nWe have talked extensively\nabout the OS top ten,\n\n455\n00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.860\nI don't think we need to\ncycle through that one again.\n\n456\n00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:42.115\nBut we do wanna take a look at the\ncritical security controls, the SANS top\n\n457\n00:22:42.115 --> 00:22:46.850\n20, CSC, which is probably now in\nversion six, if I remember correctly.\n\n458\n00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.640\nSo do SANS, S-A-N-S,\ncritical security controls.\n\n459\n00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.370\nSeparate words,\ncritical security controls.\n\n460\n00:22:55.851 --> 00:22:56.850\n>> There it is.\n\n461\n00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.100\n>> Yeah, and\nyou should get a link to the SANS website,\n\n462\n00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.140\nthere, for the common,\nsecurity controls criteria.\n\n463\n00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.950\nThe CIS, Critical Security Controls.\n\n464\n00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.790\nIf you scroll down, you'll see version\n6.0, the most recent version now.\n\n465\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.020\nAnd again, you will have a listing.\n\n466\n00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.200\nAnd actually, in this one I would like\nyou to zoom in for just a minute,\n\n467\n00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.990\ncuz we haven't really seen this before.\n\n468\n00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:15.250\nJust zoom in a little bit.\n\n469\n00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.700\nAnd a little bit more.\n\n470\n00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.230\nRight about there, that's good,\nthat's good, right there.\n\n471\n00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:23.237\nSo what we see, is we see a listing of,\nthese are updated every so often,\n\n472\n00:23:23.237 --> 00:23:26.327\nthis went through a revision\nin mid to late 2015, so\n\n473\n00:23:26.327 --> 00:23:29.252\nit's been revised over\nthe last six to nine months.\n\n474\n00:23:29.252 --> 00:23:33.124\nAnd the ordering has changed slightly from\nwhat it would have been in version 5.0,\n\n475\n00:23:33.124 --> 00:23:34.842\nbut you can see a list of top controls,\n\n476\n00:23:34.842 --> 00:23:38.557\nInventory of Authorized and Unauthorized\nDevices, Inventory of Authorized and\n\n477\n00:23:38.557 --> 00:23:42.110\nUnauthorized Software, Email and\nWeb Browser Protections, Controlled Use\n\n478\n00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:46.510\nof Administrative Privileges, Maintenance,\nMonitoring, and Analysis of Audit Logs.\n\n479\n00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.800\nThese are not unique to\nthe cloud by any means.\n\n480\n00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.620\nBut they are specifically designed to\naddress the biggest concerns we have from\n\n481\n00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.194\na security standpoint,\nregardless of where we are.\n\n482\n00:23:55.194 --> 00:23:58.939\nClick on CSC 13, I'm sorry, CSC 12.\n\n483\n00:23:58.939 --> 00:23:59.710\nBoundary defense.\n\n484\n00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:02.436\nSo let me just show you guys what\na typical control looks like.\n\n485\n00:24:02.436 --> 00:24:07.057\nYou click through, you'll scroll down, and\nyou'll be able to see that we have, aside\n\n486\n00:24:07.057 --> 00:24:11.440\nfrom all the vendors that are there, we do\nhave, or maybe scroll over I should say.\n\n487\n00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:14.940\nActually, I'm sorry.\n\n488\n00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.860\nScroll back in.\n\n489\n00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.980\nJust scroll back so\nI can see what's there specifically.\n\n490\n00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.170\nI think there's a link\nthat I'm looking for.\n\n491\n00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.160\nSo it's got, tight firewall,\nokay so there.\n\n492\n00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.300\nThat's what I wanted to understand.\n\n493\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.790\nThey're showing you the specific kind of\ncontrol, so they're showing you a list of\n\n494\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.100\nfirewalls potentially that\nare gonna provide continuity or\n\n495\n00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.140\nprotection there for you.\n\n496\n00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:32.910\n>> You have-\n>> You can do another one.\n\n497\n00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:33.760\n>> That's the Mac.\n\n498\n00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.251\nYou scroll two fingers left or right,\nand it goes backwards and forwards.\n\n499\n00:24:37.251 --> 00:24:38.350\n[LAUGH]\n>> Okay, no problem.\n\n500\n00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:41.047\nSo they're showing you a list of\ndifferent firewall vendors and\n\n501\n00:24:41.047 --> 00:24:42.890\nproducts that you may be able to get.\n\n502\n00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:45.970\nAnd depending on the control you click on,\nyou'll get documentation and\n\n503\n00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:48.600\nrecommendations and\nvarious things supporting or\n\n504\n00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.410\nhelping you to implement this\nparticular control, right?\n\n505\n00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.360\nSo these kinds of supporting\ninfrastructure elements,\n\n506\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:00.230\nthese kinds of resources for\nthe CCSP are very important, right?\n\n507\n00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.830\nWe've talked extensively about the use\nof the Cloud Security Alliance tools and\n\n508\n00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.440\nresources they provide.\n\n509\n00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.580\nCertainly something like the critical\nsecurity controls from SANS.\n\n510\n00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:13.220\nSomething like the CVSS database from\nNIST, the National Vulnerability Database.\n\n511\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.850\nThe CVE, Critical Voting Exposure\ndatabase from Mitre.\n\n512\n00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.580\nAny or all of these things are going\nto be helpful as resources for you.\n\n513\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.180\nYou're gonna wanna be aware of them and\n\n514\n00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.430\nunderstand them and you're gonna\nwanna use them as reference points\n\n515\n00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:28.050\nto help understand how to implement\nthe proper level of controls and\n\n516\n00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:32.110\noversight in your organization for\na customer, for a partner.\n\n517\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:36.300\nYou may reference this with a partner and\nsay through a federation association,\n\n518\n00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.620\nhey we are aligned with this\nparticular set of controls.\n\n519\n00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:40.770\nWhat do you do?\n\n520\n00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.220\nAre you aligned this way?\n\n521\n00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.060\nIf not, what are you doing in exchange for\nthis so that we can be on the same page?\n\n522\n00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.380\nAnd this is very important for us to\nconsider and think about as well, Adam?\n\n523\n00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.855\n>> It looks like we've, have we come\nto the end of our topics for this.\n\n524\n00:25:54.855 --> 00:25:57.650\n>> Well, we were in such a small box\nthere wasn't room for both of us to be in\n\n525\n00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.940\nthe end, at the same time, cuz we had such\na small box they could only see your head.\n\n526\n00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.670\n>> That's right.\n\n527\n00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.390\n>> But now we are actually at the end\nbecause now you can see fully\n\n528\n00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:07.040\nthe cloud has returned.\n\n529\n00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:08.230\n>> The cloud has returned.\n\n530\n00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:08.810\nWell, there's a lot.\n\n531\n00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.020\n>> We have reached\nthe end of this episode.\n\n532\n00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.260\n>> We have reached the end of this domain.\n\n533\n00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:12.310\nIt is a lot of information.\n\n534\n00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:13.430\n>> Not this domain, just this episode.\n\n535\n00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.550\n>> Of this sub-domain, this added subject.\n\n536\n00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.420\n>> Of this added subject.\n\n537\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:17.910\n>> Thank you for the correction.\n\n538\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:18.750\n>> Don't do that again.\n\n539\n00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:20.355\n>> I will do what I want, sir.\n\n540\n00:26:20.355 --> 00:26:22.320\n[LAUGH]\n>> Not on my show, you won't.\n\n541\n00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.800\n>> Not on your show, I won't.\n\n542\n00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.534\n>> This is the Dan Lowrie show.\n\n543\n00:26:25.534 --> 00:26:29.700\n[LAUGH] That being said though, we have\ncovered a lot of ground and you've given\n\n544\n00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.720\nus a lot of great helps that will help\nguide us through these auditing systems.\n\n545\n00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.593\nWe need to be able to have some play\nbook to go by to say how do we do this?\n\n546\n00:26:39.593 --> 00:26:44.708\nHow do we get consistency out of an audit\nand then therefore be able to see,\n\n547\n00:26:44.708 --> 00:26:48.480\nwe'll we're doing well or\nwe're doing poorly.\n\n548\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.180\nIf we can't do that then\nwe're basically just\n\n549\n00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.290\ntilting at windmills as they like to say.\n\n550\n00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:56.620\n>> Don Quixote,\nthe Don Quixote of the cloud.\n\n551\n00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.900\n>> That's right and that brings us\nto the end of our show everyone,\n\n552\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.990\nwe do thank you guys for\nwatching we thank you.\n\n553\n00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.260\n>> You're done just stop talking.\n\n554\n00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:08.140\n>> It's been a long day everybody,\nwe're gonna close it down,\n\n555\n00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.820\ndrop it, close this thing off.\n\n556\n00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.730\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel

him clock killer.\n\n10\n00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:35.395\nHe's going by a new.\n\n11\n00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:37.410\nGonna be known as clock\nkiller from now on.\n\n12\n00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.350\nSo everything's going well,\nit's going well.\n\n13\n00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.310\nAnd we're here to talk a little bit more,\nas we have been talking about in this area\n\n14\n00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.895\nwith regards to legal concerns, risk\nmanagement, compliance, all that stuff.\n\n15\n00:00:46.895 --> 00:00:51.210\nI wanna talk about cloud from the\nperspective of enterprise risk management,\n\n16\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.380\nand from the perspective of\noutsourcing and vendor relationships.\n\n17\n00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.720\nAnd some of the odds and\nends that we still have to address here.\n\n18\n00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.130\nWe talked a lot about risk\nacross many of our shows and\n\n19\n00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.010\nmany of our episodes,\nboth in this area and in the CCSP.\n\n20\n00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.231\nAnd more broadly, in many of the content\nepisodes you can watch here at ITProTV and\n\n21\n00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.140\nmany of the knowledge areas we have.\n\n22\n00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.110\nBecause risk is so pervasive, it's so\neverywhere and all around us today so\n\n23\n00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.800\neverywhere, right?\n\n24\n00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.550\nThat should be the new thing for\nrisk, risk it's so everywhere right?\n\n25\n00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.320\nSo risk is every where today we have to be\naware of that, we have to understand that\n\n26\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.220\nand we have to think of what\nwe would consider risk to be.\n\n27\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.100\nAnd also what we don't consider risk to be\nto start to understand how to manage it.\n\n28\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.060\nWe've talked about the impact,\nthe importance, the need,\n\n29\n00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.050\nin risk assessment for a BIA,\nBusiness Impact Analysis.\n\n30\n00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.810\nWhy that can be and indeed is so important\nto help us profile all the systems and\n\n31\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.710\nservices that we have, and\n\n32\n00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.120\nthen to understand their\nimportance to the organization.\n\n33\n00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.630\nWe talked about this in reference\nto business continuity and\n\n34\n00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.780\ndisaster recovery planning for\ninstance in one of our prior discussions.\n\n35\n00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.050\nAnd we have to think about the risk\nprofile of the organization, essentially\n\n36\n00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.470\nthe risk appetite which is often how\nyou hear risk profile referred to.\n\n37\n00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.830\nHow willing is the business to take on\ncertain risks, and under what conditions\n\n38\n00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.440\nwill those risks actually become important\nfor us to consider and/or to be aware of?\n\n39\n00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.870\nAnd when we think about the risk profile,\n\n40\n00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.792\nthe risk profile should be set up in such\na way that risks are clearly identified.\n\n41\n00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:18.830\nAnd ranked in some order so we understand\nwhat risks we are taking on and\n\n42\n00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.920\nwhat impact they may have to the business.\n\n43\n00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.790\nAnd to that end, we wanna take\na look at the graphic that we have\n\n44\n00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.340\non Daniel's machine with regards to risk.\n\n45\n00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.221\nOr at least a nice little\ninteresting way I did set you up.\n\n46\n00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:30.389\n[LAUGH].\nI do apologize.\n\n47\n00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:34.290\nI talked about showing I'm going through\nthe roles first, that was my mistake.\n\n48\n00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.220\nI'll accept responsibility for that one.\n\n49\n00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.950\nI wanted to actually just throw this up\nreal quick and talk about this first,\n\n50\n00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.535\nso surprise!\n\n51\n00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:41.460\n[LAUGH].\nHere we are.\n\n52\n00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.040\nHere we are.\n\n53\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.830\n[LAUGH] And so\nlet's talk a little bit about risk and\n\n54\n00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.660\nthe risk matrix that\nyou see in front of us.\n\n55\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.075\nThis is a fairly traditional\nway of representing risk.\n\n56\n00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:53.070\nDanny and I were chatting right before\nwe got started and he looked at this and\n\n57\n00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.490\nsaid, hey I've done that before.\n\n58\n00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.106\nWe do that in project management is\nwhat you were telling me- Mm-hm.\n\n59\n00:02:57.106 --> 00:03:00.960\nRight before we got started, and this is\na standardized way of looking at risk.\n\n60\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.490\nDoesn't matter if we're\ntalking about cloud security.\n\n61\n00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.700\nDoesn't matter if we're talking\nabout project management.\n\n62\n00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.270\nAs I said, risk is risk.\n\n63\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.430\nWe look at likelihood, which is on the\nleft hand column there, as you can see.\n\n64\n00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.780\nWe look at consequence or impact, which\nis often how you hear consequence framed.\n\n65\n00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.150\nAnd then as a result of likelihood and\nconsequence, we look at exposure.\n\n66\n00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.110\nAnd exposure is what's gonna be the gray\nshading that we see to represent likely,\n\n67\n00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.660\nunlikely, highly unlikely.\n\n68\n00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.905\nAnd then slightly harmful, harmful, and\nextremely harmful, essentially modified,\n\n69\n00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:34.331\nor excuse me, not modified.\n\n70\n00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:38.116\nMultiplied together and added up in\nsuch a way that we get a derivative and\n\n71\n00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:42.585\nthat derivative of green, yellow, and/or\nred is going to be our exposure ranking or\n\n72\n00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:43.570\nrating.\n\n73\n00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.040\nSo we have likelihood,\nwe have consequence, or\n\n74\n00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.040\nyou could think of it as impact.\n\n75\n00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.180\nAnd when we have likelihood\nmultiplied by impact we get exposure.\n\n76\n00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.330\nAnd exposure is what we see in red,\nyellow, and green on the matrix here.\n\n77\n00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.787\nAnd so something that is at\nthe lower left hand quadrant, lower,\n\n78\n00:04:00.787 --> 00:04:06.732\nlower left hand on both, which will be\nhighly unlikely, and slightly harmful.\n\n79\n00:04:06.732 --> 00:04:11.130\nAt the the intersection of those two,\nwe see in green, an insignificant risk.\n\n80\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.820\nNow you will see this ranking in this\nset up done slightly differently,\n\n81\n00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.910\nsometimes it's done with numbers,\nsometimes it's done with categories.\n\n82\n00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.900\nSo you may see a one, two, three matrix\nand one, two, three, one, two, three.\n\n83\n00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.479\nAnd you do a one and\none is one at the lower left, and\n\n84\n00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:29.640\na three times three at the upper right,\nin red, for extreme, will be nine.\n\n85\n00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.650\nAnd so you see this matrix done\ndifferently, but ultimately,\n\n86\n00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.140\nit represents the same thing.\n\n87\n00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.090\nIt's a probability, impact,\nand exposure matrix, and\n\n88\n00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.460\nwe're talking about probability\nis likelihood, by the way.\n\n89\n00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.650\nImpact is going to be consequence, and\n\n90\n00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.540\nexposure is ultimately the ranking,\nright, that we get.\n\n91\n00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.520\nAnd so you hear it often sometimes\nreferred to as a pie matrix or\n\n92\n00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.760\na pie chart.\n\n93\n00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.880\nNot the pie chart you think of where\nwe're carving up the circle, but\n\n94\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.020\na risk management pie chart is\na probability impacted exposure table.\n\n95\n00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.864\nAnd so it can be referred to that way,\nsometimes done as likelihood consequence,\n\n96\n00:05:02.864 --> 00:05:04.290\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n97\n00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.880\nThe idea is that for the security\nprofessional, we wanna be able to rank\n\n98\n00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.690\nour risks in the organization based on\nthe likelihood that they will occur.\n\n99\n00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.540\nAnd the impact if they do occur.\n\n100\n00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.090\nAnd obviously the higher the likelihood,\nas we move up of the scale on the left and\n\n101\n00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.130\nas we move over on the right.\n\n102\n00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.990\nThe more likely something is to happen and\nthe higher impact it has when it does.\n\n103\n00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.700\nThe more likely it is to occur and\nthe more impact it will have when it does\n\n104\n00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:34.090\noccur, changes the rating from green\nto yellow, from low to medium.\n\n105\n00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.480\nOr insignificant to low to medium,\nand from medium to high.\n\n106\n00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.730\nTo extreme at the upper right hand area or\nquadrant and\n\n107\n00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.560\nan extreme risk very likely to occur.\n\n108\n00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.000\nHigh likelihood, extremely harmful\nis one that we have to mitigate or\n\n109\n00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.440\naddress immediately.\n\n110\n00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.050\nBecause chances are it's gonna happen and\nwhen it does it's gonna hurt us and\n\n111\n00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.750\nit's gonna have a very negative impact.\n\n112\n00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.240\nBut one that is insignificant, highly\nunlikely to occur even if it does occur,\n\n113\n00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.240\nextremely unlikely to cause us\nany significant harm or duress.\n\n114\n00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.810\nIs one that we may get\naround to at some point but\n\n115\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.310\neven if we don't get around to it before\nit happens, we might not even notice it.\n\n116\n00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.210\nAnd let alone if it does happen and\nwe do notice it,\n\n117\n00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.360\nit's gonna be very inconsequential.\n\n118\n00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.000\nSo we wanna use a matrix like this\nto understand how to rank risks and\n\n119\n00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.080\nas a result, judge what our risk\nprofile or risk appetite may be.\n\n120\n00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.050\nThe higher value the target, the more\nlikely it is that it can be compromised,\n\n121\n00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.850\nthe more impact it will have,\nthe more high the risk ranking will be.\n\n122\n00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.580\nAnd as a result, the less likely\nwe are to tolerate that risk.\n\n123\n00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.940\nThe risk appetite, in other words,\nshould be considered to be low for\n\n124\n00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.996\nthe risk profile of\nthe organization in this area.\n\n125\n00:06:36.996 --> 00:06:41.870\nBut we do wanna understand that\nwe will have a risk appetite or\n\n126\n00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.950\nprofile that is made up of a mixture\nof low, medium and high risks, right?\n\n127\n00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.020\nWe're not just as, we were just\ntalking about right off-camera for\n\n128\n00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.865\none of our colleagues here, we're not\njust gonna survive on soda by itself.\n\n129\n00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:54.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're not just gonna survive on healthy\n\n130\n00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.430\nfood by itself right?\n\n131\n00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.110\nAt least in theory most of us\ndon't since you said except for\n\n132\n00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.330\ngenetic abnormalities and\noccasional strong constitutions right?\n\n133\n00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.930\nThe reality is that, yeah,\n\n134\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.130\nwe're gonna have a mixture\nin our diet of things right?\n\n135\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.360\nWe eat a little junk food every so often,\nwe eat a little healthy food every so\n\n136\n00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.480\noften, we eat a lot of stuff in between\nthat's partially junky partially healthy.\n\n137\n00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.510\nAnd then we lie about it to all of\nour friends and colleagues, right?\n\n138\n00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.570\nSo the reality is we're\ngonna have a mix and\n\n139\n00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.500\nbecause of that, we're gonna see\nthe same behavior occur here.\n\n140\n00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.750\nWe're gonna have a mixture of risk levels,\nand\n\n141\n00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.730\nour risk appetite has to\nreflect that in the business.\n\n142\n00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.080\nRemember, we have to accept certain\nrisks as the cost of doing business.\n\n143\n00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.720\nWe can avoid certain risks,\nnot engage in those activities.\n\n144\n00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.424\nWe could transfer certain risks, we could\ndecide to give them away to somebody else.\n\n145\n00:07:37.424 --> 00:07:41.060\nAnd/or we can mitigate risks,\nwe can decide\n\n146\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.580\nto minimize the impacts certain risks have\nby managing them, by identifying them.\n\n147\n00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.480\nAnd by having compensating and\noffsetting controls to address them if and\n\n148\n00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.750\nwhen they occur.\n\n149\n00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.273\nSo we do wanna understand risk.\n\n150\n00:07:52.273 --> 00:07:56.366\nWe do wanna understand the value of risk\nand the nature of risk to our business and\n\n151\n00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:59.311\nrisk profile, a risk appetite,\nhelps us to frame that.\n\n152\n00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.775\nWe do wanna go back and\ntake a look at the roles now, so\n\n153\n00:08:01.775 --> 00:08:03.294\nif you actually do have them up.\n\n154\n00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:05.911\n[LAUGH] This time I am Serious about that,\nwe do wanna take a look.\n\n155\n00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:08.194\nWe're gonna remind you\nquickly about the roles,\n\n156\n00:08:08.194 --> 00:08:12.510\nthat we identified in one of our prior\nconversations in a prior episodes here.\n\n157\n00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.180\nWe are talking about data and\nthe processing of personally identifiable\n\n158\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.308\ninformation, and\nthe roles associated with doing that, and\n\n159\n00:08:19.308 --> 00:08:22.080\nthen the risks associated\nwith owning that data.\n\n160\n00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:25.080\nSo you should definitely understand\nwhat a data subject is, or\n\n161\n00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.620\nwho the data subject is.\n\n162\n00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.084\nYou should know what the Data Controller,\nData Processor, Data Steward,\n\n163\n00:08:31.084 --> 00:08:35.826\nData Custodian, and Data Ownership rules\nare, what they are responsible for,\n\n164\n00:08:35.826 --> 00:08:38.915\nwhat they do or do not do,\nin relation to each other.\n\n165\n00:08:38.915 --> 00:08:42.711\nWe've been through this in great detail in\na prior episode, encourage you to go back,\n\n166\n00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:44.863\ntake a look and\nreview that material there.\n\n167\n00:08:44.863 --> 00:08:47.425\nMaybe we could pull the box in,\nbox out for just a minute, while\n\n168\n00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:50.965\nI'm just finishing up talking that way we\ncould see for a minute while I'm talking,\n\n169\n00:08:50.965 --> 00:08:54.617\nthey can at least review quickly here as\nwell, and read through the definitions.\n\n170\n00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.287\nBut remember, we talked about the fact,\n\n171\n00:08:56.287 --> 00:09:00.497\nI just wanna make one quick point\nabout this, that the data subject is\n\n172\n00:09:00.497 --> 00:09:04.907\nthe individual who's essentially gonna be\nproviding the pie, right, it's about them.\n\n173\n00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:08.872\nAnd the data owner may very well\nbe the data subject, right?\n\n174\n00:09:08.872 --> 00:09:11.430\nWith regards to personally\nidentifiable information,\n\n175\n00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:13.710\nthe data owner is indeed the data subject.\n\n176\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.490\nBut there is gonna joint ownership.\n\n177\n00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.620\nWe're gonna share ownership and\nresponsibility for that data, with one or\n\n178\n00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.820\nmore parties that are given the data,\nto be able to achieve some end result,\n\n179\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.130\nto put us in a database,\nto sell us something,\n\n180\n00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.690\nto manage our patient records and\nour healthcare as a doctor would, right.\n\n181\n00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.140\nThey're gonna jointly own\nour data along with us, but\n\n182\n00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.623\nultimate ownership is retained by us.\n\n183\n00:09:35.623 --> 00:09:37.911\nAnd so as we talked about\nthe right to be forgotten,\n\n184\n00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:41.476\nwe as the data owner of record ultimately\nhave the right to be able to request, in\n\n185\n00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:45.662\nsome parts of the world anyway, to request\nthat that data be removed from the system.\n\n186\n00:09:45.662 --> 00:09:47.530\nSo we have to remember that,\nand think about that.\n\n187\n00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.090\nSo as a CCSP, you definitely\nwanna focus on these definitions.\n\n188\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.490\nMake sure you're clear on them.\n\n189\n00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.347\nMake sure you understand what they are,\nright?\n\n190\n00:09:54.347 --> 00:09:59.360\nAnd make sure that we are going to\nbe able to refer to them as needed.\n\n191\n00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.490\nRight, I guess my thing was not\nas good as your thing, right?\n\n192\n00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.019\nThat was not the proper thing to do.\n\n193\n00:10:04.019 --> 00:10:07.416\nSo I'll make sure I do the proper thing\nnext time, so that we can actually\n\n194\n00:10:07.416 --> 00:10:11.060\nmove back and forth clearly and cleanly\nwithout having to [LAUGH] pause there.\n\n195\n00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.350\nSorry about that, Meagan,\nI thought you would just see that and\n\n196\n00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.920\nunderstand I wanted you to move forward,\nI do apologize.\n\n197\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.945\nSo it's the end of the day here and\n\n198\n00:10:17.945 --> 00:10:20.075\nwe're not quite clear on what our\ncommunication signals need to be.\n\n199\n00:10:20.075 --> 00:10:21.260\n>> Getting a little punchy.\n\n200\n00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.399\n>> Little punchy, little punchy.\n\n201\n00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.833\nI don't know, in most places in\nthe world you do this, they understand,\n\n202\n00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.515\nyou wanna go to the next thing,\nI'm just saying.\n\n203\n00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:27.585\nI guess it wasn't working, I don't know.\n\n204\n00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.753\nAnyway, so Service Level Agreements, SLAs.\n\n205\n00:10:29.753 --> 00:10:33.325\nWe do talk, and I've talked a lot\nabout the need to have SLAs,\n\n206\n00:10:33.325 --> 00:10:36.694\nessentially a contract that binds us,\nthe customer, and\n\n207\n00:10:36.694 --> 00:10:39.350\nus the cloud service provider together.\n\n208\n00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.030\nStipulates the terms of service,\nstipulates the ways in which service\n\n209\n00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.370\nwill essentially occur, and commits\nboth of us to certain requirements and\n\n210\n00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.290\ncertain recommendations, that we have\nto follow in order to do our job and\n\n211\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.960\nmeet our responsibilities\nwith regards to the cloud.\n\n212\n00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.390\nTypically, availability and\nperformance are managed and\n\n213\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.790\nmeasured quantitatively with metrics.\n\n214\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.350\nTypically, uptime is measured\nthis way through an SLA, 99.9 or\n\n215\n00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.594\n39 uptime is often referred to\nas the standard with most modern\n\n216\n00:11:07.594 --> 00:11:12.018\nenterprise level, and\nretail-ready cloud service providers.\n\n217\n00:11:12.018 --> 00:11:16.470\nSo Microsoft, Amazon, etc, tend to give\nyou 39 uptime as a starting point.\n\n218\n00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.760\nYou can pay for more, but that's the\nguarantee they will normally offer you.\n\n219\n00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:23.230\nSecurity and, or privacy of the data,\nlogging and reporting,\n\n220\n00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:28.140\ndisaster recovery, location,\ndata format and structure, portability.\n\n221\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.260\nThese are all things that typically get\nlaid out and stipulated as part of an SLA.\n\n222\n00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:36.990\nExit strategies, making sure we have\nchanged management layout and discussed.\n\n223\n00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.756\nAgain, these would all be things that\nwe've talked about you as a CSSP,\n\n224\n00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:44.587\nhaving to negotiate and stipulate,\nwould be in the hosting agreements,\n\n225\n00:11:44.587 --> 00:11:47.207\nyou wanna make sure\nare covered as part of the SLA.\n\n226\n00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:50.688\nSo key SLA elements essentially\nare gonna really focus on and\n\n227\n00:11:50.688 --> 00:11:55.602\naddress the assessments of the operational\nenvironment, identification of risk,\n\n228\n00:11:55.602 --> 00:11:59.971\nand the risk assessment as part of\nthe organizational infrastructure, and\n\n229\n00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:03.360\nthe management of the SLA or\nuse of the SLA to guide that.\n\n230\n00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.530\nWe should detail out and\nunderstand a risk profile and\n\n231\n00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:07.740\na risk appetite as part of that.\n\n232\n00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.295\nOur responsibilities, regulatory\nrequirements and concerns, and any or\n\n233\n00:12:11.295 --> 00:12:13.682\nall risk management frameworks\nthat may be used and\n\n234\n00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:17.450\nbrought to bear with regards to\nunderstanding how to operate the cloud.\n\n235\n00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.390\nThings like ISO 31000 for\nrisk management, ISO 27001 and 27002,\n\n236\n00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.930\nfor the building of the ISMS.\n\n237\n00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.193\nSome of the other risk management and\n\n238\n00:12:28.193 --> 00:12:31.266\nguidance based ISO documents\nthat we can look at.\n\n239\n00:12:31.266 --> 00:12:34.890\nCan we go back and take a look at some\nof those ISO documents we have teed up,\n\n240\n00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.950\nwe have a whole bunch,\nI know I asked you to, we do have many.\n\n241\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.730\nWe could start, I know it may be hard to\ngo in numerical order, cuz I gave you them\n\n242\n00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:47.620\nout of order, but we've done 27001 and\n27002 already, do we have 27013 up there?\n\n243\n00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.101\nI think we do somewhere,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n244\n00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:52.585\n>> 15-\n>> Or not.\n\n245\n00:12:52.585 --> 00:12:54.166\n[LAUGH]\n>> We might not have that one up.\n\n246\n00:12:54.166 --> 00:12:55.105\n>> That's okay.\n>> We don't.\n\n247\n00:12:55.105 --> 00:12:57.540\n>> That's not a problem.\nDo 27014 if we have that one there.\n\n248\n00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.620\nOr you could do 27013 really quickly,\nwe could search for that one too.\n\n249\n00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.140\nLook for that in real-time, not a problem.\n\n250\n00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.330\nSo, I think you'll find that\nthere somewhere, correct?\n\n251\n00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.731\nI think we may have had it at one point\nmay have just not left it up there.\n\n252\n00:13:08.731 --> 00:13:13.732\nAll right, so you'll see there\nthat we have with ISO 27013,\n\n253\n00:13:13.732 --> 00:13:18.197\nthis is essentially gonna be\nguidance on the integration of\n\n254\n00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:22.773\nthe implementation for\nISO 27001 and ISO 20000.\n\n255\n00:13:22.773 --> 00:13:28.908\nSo this particular document\nessentially brings together 27001,\n\n256\n00:13:28.908 --> 00:13:33.670\nwhich is the ISMS and\nISO 20000, as you can see.\n\n257\n00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.567\nAnd if you Google ISO 27,\nif you Google ISO 20000 quickly,\n\n258\n00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:41.714\nfor just a minute we can\nbring that one up and\n\n259\n00:13:41.714 --> 00:13:45.749\nshow the good kind folk\nout there what ISO 27001.\n\n260\n00:13:45.749 --> 00:13:47.502\nExcuse me,\n[SOUND] I'm just gonna stop talking.\n\n261\n00:13:47.502 --> 00:13:50.974\n[LAUGH] what ISO 20000 is I'm so\nused to saying 27000,\n\n262\n00:13:50.974 --> 00:13:55.160\nbecause it is the information\nsecurity standard we often reference.\n\n263\n00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.570\nBut ISO 27000 is all about\ninformation security.\n\n264\n00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.120\nISO 20000, as you can see,\nis about service management and\n\n265\n00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.020\nservice management system requirements.\n\n266\n00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.138\nSo this is gonna bring together ISO 27013.\n\n267\n00:14:07.138 --> 00:14:13.138\n27013 brings together the ISMS and\nthe service requirements from 20000,\n\n268\n00:14:13.138 --> 00:14:18.898\nto understand how to achieve and build\na security system that is service aligned.\n\n269\n00:14:18.898 --> 00:14:22.650\nThink ITIL when we think about services\nfor instance, and service management,\n\n270\n00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.291\nthat's gonna have change management,\nrelease and deployment management,\n\n271\n00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:27.836\nincentive problem management,\n\n272\n00:14:27.836 --> 00:14:30.960\nthat's where we bring all of this\nframework infrastructure in.\n\n273\n00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.120\nAnd we combine the two together,\nand when we link them and\n\n274\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.055\ncombine them together in ISO 2713,\nwe see the perfect storm emerging, right?\n\n275\n00:14:39.055 --> 00:14:41.761\nWhich is the ability to have the ISMS and\n\n276\n00:14:41.761 --> 00:14:45.495\nthe ITIL framework overlay,\nwith regards to change management and\n\n277\n00:14:45.495 --> 00:14:48.980\nall the things we have to do to\nmanage risk in the organization.\n\n278\n00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.880\nBut from an IT service and\ncustomer-centric perspective.\n\n279\n00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.752\nSo that's what 27,013 speaks to.\n\n280\n00:14:54.752 --> 00:15:00.980\nI know we have 27014 up as well so 2 7 0 1\n4, you had that one up there, there we go.\n\n281\n00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.989\nSo that one is going to allow\nus to have governance for, or\n\n282\n00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:06.830\ngovernance guidance on\ninformation security.\n\n283\n00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.470\nSo it's gonna provide guidance on\nthe information security overlay.\n\n284\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:16.770\nWe have 27, I believe, 16, and\ndid we do 15, 16, 17, and 18?\n\n285\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:17.942\nOr just 16, 17, and 18?\n\n286\n00:15:17.942 --> 00:15:18.720\n>> There's 16.\n\n287\n00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.852\n>> Okay, we did 16.\n\n288\n00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:26.250\nSo you see 27016, and you'll see\nthis one is all about information\n\n289\n00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:29.700\nsecurity management organizational\neconomics, kind of an interesting one.\n\n290\n00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.030\nThis helps us to provide\nfinancial guidance and\n\n291\n00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:35.412\noversight on standards around making\nsure that we're investing and\n\n292\n00:15:35.412 --> 00:15:39.606\nthat we're doing the proper things we need\nto do, with regards to risk management and\n\n293\n00:15:39.606 --> 00:15:42.363\ninformation security from\nan economics perspective.\n\n294\n00:15:42.363 --> 00:15:44.520\nMaking good choices in other words, right?\n\n295\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.770\nSo that's part of this.\n\n296\n00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.607\nThen we have, I believe,\n17 and 18 up as well, right?\n\n297\n00:15:48.607 --> 00:15:49.806\n>> 17.\n>> So we have 17,\n\n298\n00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:55.531\n17 is the code of practice for information\nsecurity controls based on 27002.\n\n299\n00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:59.524\nBut specifically translating 27002\nat the end of that statement,\n\n300\n00:15:59.524 --> 00:16:01.495\nas you'll see for cloud services.\n\n301\n00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:06.550\nSo we're taking the ISMS controls\nin 27002 and porting them.\n\n302\n00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:10.438\nSpecifically over to the cloud,\nwith ISO 27016.\n\n303\n00:16:10.438 --> 00:16:12.291\nYou'll notice the date on that, 2015,\n\n304\n00:16:12.291 --> 00:16:15.870\nthat actually came out in late December\nof 2015, so that's a relatively new one.\n\n305\n00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.610\nThat's only been out a few months\nat this point, very, very new.\n\n306\n00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:23.430\nAnd then 27018, which is also up there\nI believe and that one is gonna,\n\n307\n00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:26.590\nas you see, help us to understand and\ndeal with a code of practice for\n\n308\n00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:31.230\nthe protection of PII in public\nclouds acting as pi processors.\n\n309\n00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.860\nWell we've talked about processing and\nthe processor role,\n\n310\n00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.440\nwe've talked about public clouds,\nthis is another real important one.\n\n311\n00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.730\nThis is a data management standard and\na risk abatement standard for\n\n312\n00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:46.340\nPII in the public cloud space as a cloud,\nor excuse me, as a PII processor.\n\n313\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.980\nAnd if you remember, the processor role is\ngonna be the role that actually is going\n\n314\n00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.530\nto go out and have to deal with data.\n\n315\n00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.960\nSo that's gonna be important as well,\nright.\n\n316\n00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.260\nSo, just consider that and\njust think about that.\n\n317\n00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:00.520\nSo those are the kind of things that we\nwanna make sure we're focusing on and\n\n318\n00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.790\nwe are concerned with.\n\n319\n00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.670\nThese are, in other words,\na random sampling of ISO standards,\n\n320\n00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.280\nnot random, not so\nrandom, I shouldn't say.\n\n321\n00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:11.770\nBut actually very well thought out and\ndetailed sampling of ISO standards.\n\n322\n00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.660\nSo I should pat myself on the back cuz I'm\nthe one who told you to put them all up\n\n323\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.370\nthere, all right?\n\n324\n00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:19.920\nSo a very detailed sampling of\nthe current and pertinent ISO standards.\n\n325\n00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.220\nWith regards to information\nsecurity management,\n\n326\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.840\nwith regards to risk management and\nalso tailored and\n\n327\n00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.920\nscoped specifically to address\nconcerns in the cloud.\n\n328\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.800\nAs a CCSP, you would want to be\naware of all these ISO standards.\n\n329\n00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.860\nNow again, let's review and\n\n330\n00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:36.680\nremind ourselves quickly of what\naware of ISO standards means here.\n\n331\n00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.450\nWith regards to the exam, we wanna have\nfirst hand knowledge of the standards.\n\n332\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.510\nSo for instance,\n\n333\n00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.830\nwe wanna know that ISO 27018 deals\nwith the use of and regulation of and\n\n334\n00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.590\nmanagement of PII from the public cloud\nspace from the processor's perspective.\n\n335\n00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.900\nIf you know that, you know everything you\nneed to know about that ISO standard.\n\n336\n00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.640\nWe're not gonna ask you to read it, we're\nnot gonna ask you how to implement it,\n\n337\n00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.930\nwe're not gonna ask you how many pages it\nis, we're not gonna ask you what it says.\n\n338\n00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.450\nWe're gonna ask you what it does,\nwhat it addresses, why is it important.\n\n339\n00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:08.440\nSo if you know that, then you are good.\n\n340\n00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.220\nIf you don't, you better go back and\nreview the last six or\n\n341\n00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.740\nseven minutes of dialog and\n\n342\n00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.920\nmake sure you understand what every one\nof those ISO standards is good for.\n\n343\n00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.380\nRemember I've talked several\ntimes about ISO 31,000.\n\n344\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.550\nCan you throw that one up real quick,\nwe didn't actually put that one up but,\n\n345\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:23.940\njust wanna make sure you see that.\n\n346\n00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.660\nIt's a generic risk management standard,\n\n347\n00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.070\nit's the ISO risk management standard,\noverall.\n\n348\n00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.060\nRegardless of implementation\nin the cloud or\n\n349\n00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:33.180\nnot, it is just the ISO\nguidance on risk management.\n\n350\n00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:35.410\nBut you wanna make sure you're\naware of this one as well,\n\n351\n00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.450\nit's also very important.\n\n352\n00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.781\nSo, just make sure you're\nfocusing on these,\n\n353\n00:18:40.781 --> 00:18:44.680\nThere a list of 31000, 27001,\n\n354\n00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.360\n27002, 27013, 27014, right.\n\n355\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.330\nWe did 16, we did 17, we did 18.\n\n356\n00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:59.060\nThere's 27034, there's 15408 which is\nthe common criteria which we're gonna\n\n357\n00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.260\ncome to soon.\n\n358\n00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:03.630\nThat's 10 ISO standards that you\nshould probably have a sense of and\n\n359\n00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.530\nhave some awareness.\n\n360\n00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:07.090\nSo you wanna make sure have that hit\nlist and understand what they are,\n\n361\n00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.110\nthis is going to be very\nvery important for you.\n\n362\n00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.650\nWhen we think about the cloud and we think\nabout risk management, we also have to\n\n363\n00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:16.630\nthink about risk mitigation and we talked\nabout this, you know minimizing risks and\n\n364\n00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.040\nthe need to understand that's one of\nthe four acceptable ways to manage risk.\n\n365\n00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.370\nAnd I'll review quickly again for\nyou what they are, right risk acceptance,\n\n366\n00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.580\nrisk avoidance, risk transference,\nand of course our favorite and\n\n367\n00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.560\nthe topic of this little bit of\nthe conversation risk mitigation.\n\n368\n00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.560\nMinimization of risk is a valid and\n\n369\n00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.660\ncertainly very acceptable way to deal with\nrisk, but we have to understand that when\n\n370\n00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.920\nwe mitigate risk, we also will\ntypically then have residual risk.\n\n371\n00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.920\nRisk that is left behind, that we\ndon't always manage out of the system,\n\n372\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.230\nand there's always some element of\nrisks left in our organization.\n\n373\n00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.680\nAnd we need to be aware of that, need to\nthink about that, need to identify that,\n\n374\n00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.270\nand need to understand,\nthat that is the case.\n\n375\n00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:54.590\nRemember, we've taken a look at how to\nscope out, likelihood, consequence,\n\n376\n00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.350\nimpact, probability impact exposure,\nand the ranking, or rating of risk.\n\n377\n00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.650\nAnd risk management metrics becomes\nvery important to us as well.\n\n378\n00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.430\nWe have to understand\nour risk appetite and\n\n379\n00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.970\nour risk profile with respect to that and\nwe have to understand that there are as\n\n380\n00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.710\nwe've seen many different risk management\nframeworks that may be brought to bare.\n\n381\n00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.140\nWe took a look at ISO we've\ntalked about this extensively.\n\n382\n00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.040\nI did not mention ENISA although\nI think it came up at one\n\n383\n00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.280\npoint at some earlier time we\ntook a look at it at least.\n\n384\n00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.790\nHinted at it, but the European Network and\nInformation Security Agency,\n\n385\n00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.420\nwe call it ENISA,\nhas their own risk framework as well.\n\n386\n00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.180\nIt's very popular in certain\nparts of the world and\n\n387\n00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.590\ncan also be used in\nreference as a point here.\n\n388\n00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:35.770\nSo E-N-I-S-A ENISA would also be\nsomething for you to consider and\n\n389\n00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:37.110\nthink about with regards to risk.\n\n390\n00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.290\nYou know risk is pervasive,\nit's all around us,\n\n391\n00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.050\nit's everywhere we go,\nit's involved in everything we do.\n\n392\n00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:44.520\nAdding the word cloud\nto our infrastructure\n\n393\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.640\ndoesn't change the fact that we have risk.\n\n394\n00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.170\nIt broadens the availability and\napplicability of the risk management\n\n395\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:53.970\nconversation because it brings\nnew risks in to the organization.\n\n396\n00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:57.030\nBut it doesn't change the fact\nthat risks will be there, and\n\n397\n00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.480\nit doesn't change the fact\nthat we have to manage that.\n\n398\n00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.520\nWe have to understand and detail out\nour business requirements, in order to\n\n399\n00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.550\nunderstand how to really understand\nhow to manage risk and identify risk.\n\n400\n00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.180\nDealing with contractors, dealing with\noutsourcing, dealing with vendors,\n\n401\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.350\nis gonna be driven by this need to\nunderstand business requirements.\n\n402\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:17.400\nTo stipulate them, to manage risk,\nby documenting and\n\n403\n00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.930\nclearly communicating, what our needs,\nand or our concerns are gonna be.\n\n404\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.010\nSo prior to entering into\na contract with anybody, for\n\n405\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.890\nanything, whether alone, or let alone,\nwhether it's in the cloud or\n\n406\n00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.040\nnot, we should always have a good\nunderstanding, a good expectation, for\n\n407\n00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.700\nwhat we want to achieve, but\nespecially in the cloud.\n\n408\n00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:35.240\nAs I've hit on several\ntimes in different areas.\n\n409\n00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.510\nWe have to detail out what\nour expectations are,\n\n410\n00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.540\nwe have to be upfront with or vendors.\n\n411\n00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:42.410\nUnderstand what we want from them,\nwhat they will like from us.\n\n412\n00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.025\nAnd we have to exchange\nthat understanding and\n\n413\n00:21:45.025 --> 00:21:47.545\nput that into a contract, in some form.\n\n414\n00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:51.765\nWe have to understand, in other words,\nour risk exposure, as a CCSP\n\n415\n00:21:51.765 --> 00:21:55.255\nrepresenting the business, and we have to\nunderstand the customer, in other words,\n\n416\n00:21:55.255 --> 00:21:58.515\nhas to understand their risk exposure,\nand the Cloud provider has to,\n\n417\n00:21:58.515 --> 00:22:02.055\nnot only appreciate that, but\nalso share their risk exposure with us.\n\n418\n00:22:02.055 --> 00:22:04.825\nThey're gonna isolate us in\na multi-tenant environment so\n\n419\n00:22:04.825 --> 00:22:08.350\nthat their risk exposure for\ntheir other customers is minimized.\n\n420\n00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:12.020\nWe benefit from that, so does the cloud\nprovider, so do all the other customers,\n\n421\n00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.090\neverybody wins.\n\n422\n00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:17.040\nSo we have to understand what risk is,\nbut we have to be appropriate with risk.\n\n423\n00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.390\nIt's not just about multi-ten and\nisolation.\n\n424\n00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.220\nHow long has that provider\nbeen in business?\n\n425\n00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:22.390\nHow reputable are they?\n\n426\n00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.020\nHow many customers do they have?\n\n427\n00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.950\nHow long have they been\ndoing what they are doing?\n\n428\n00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.210\nHow good are they at doing that?\n\n429\n00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.860\nIs that their main line of business?\n\n430\n00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.430\nDo they do this on the side?\n\n431\n00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:31.870\nThey sell suits for a living, but\n\n432\n00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.180\nthey're also a cloud vendor\nout the back door at night.\n\n433\n00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.790\nRight, that's probably not\nthe best cloud vendor to go with.\n\n434\n00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:39.810\nFly By Night Cloud Enterprises is\nnot the name of a company I wanna\n\n435\n00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:40.760\nhost with, right?\n\n436\n00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.110\nAt least not me, anyway,\ncuz I'm risk adverse.\n\n437\n00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:46.400\nI wanna go with Rock Solid Rock of\nGibraltar Cloud Services, right?\n\n438\n00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.720\nCuz that's all we do.\n\n439\n00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.590\nSo I wanna go with a cloud company\nthat is focused on doing that.\n\n440\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.929\nSo\n>> I'm cancelling my fly-by-night\n\n441\n00:22:52.929 --> 00:22:53.770\nsubscription right now.\n\n442\n00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well we had this conversation before.\n\n443\n00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.350\nAnd I told you, if they don't have\na mailing address for payments,\n\n444\n00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:00.395\nyou don't wanna go with them.\n\n445\n00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:01.400\n>> But I look legit.\n\n446\n00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.372\n[LAUGH]\n>> Look you drove a nice car.\n\n447\n00:23:03.372 --> 00:23:03.905\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you know.\n\n448\n00:23:03.905 --> 00:23:07.185\nYou also have nice speakers hanging at\nthe back for sale at the same time.\n\n449\n00:23:07.185 --> 00:23:09.385\nRight, so, where are they located, right?\n\n450\n00:23:09.385 --> 00:23:10.045\nWhat do they do?\n\n451\n00:23:10.045 --> 00:23:11.325\nHow long have they been there?\n\n452\n00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:13.735\nHow up to date is their\ntechnology platform?\n\n453\n00:23:13.735 --> 00:23:16.307\nAre they open-sourced,\nare they proprietary?\n\n454\n00:23:16.307 --> 00:23:19.175\nDo they host large, medium,\nand small customers?\n\n455\n00:23:19.175 --> 00:23:21.185\nDo they specialize in\none niche of the market?\n\n456\n00:23:21.185 --> 00:23:24.695\nYou know there are club providers out\nthere that specializes in certain kinds\n\n457\n00:23:24.695 --> 00:23:28.040\nof hosting and it may be very appropriate,\nif that's what you need.\n\n458\n00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.250\nBut you want to typically go with a cloud\nprovider that has a mix of customers,\n\n459\n00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.750\na mix of technologies, and\n\n460\n00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:37.330\na mix of business models so that way\nyou can mix and match and fit them\n\n461\n00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.710\ninto your needs as opposed to you having\nto fit into their service provisioning.\n\n462\n00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:42.370\nIt's very important.\n\n463\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.290\nWe talked about the fact that cloud\nequals a one size fits one solution,\n\n464\n00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:49.570\nthe flexibility is really what we need and\nwhat we're paying for.\n\n465\n00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.850\nSo we have to understand that risk\nexposure, it is very important.\n\n466\n00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.280\nHow do we get off the cloud platform?\n\n467\n00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.850\nWhat's our exit strategy?\n\n468\n00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:59.548\nIf we have a disaster, as we've talked\nextensively about, how do we recover?\n\n469\n00:23:59.548 --> 00:24:02.150\nDo have any friends, colleagues,\n\n470\n00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.850\npeers and vendors that we know that we\ntrust that are using this care provider?\n\n471\n00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.792\nSo you can get recommendation from that.\n\n472\n00:24:08.792 --> 00:24:11.237\nIf we have people we know that\nhave used that cloud provider and\n\n473\n00:24:11.237 --> 00:24:12.404\nare no longer using them.\n\n474\n00:24:12.404 --> 00:24:13.168\nWhy not.\n\n475\n00:24:13.168 --> 00:24:16.922\nI'm very fair typically when I talk\nto customers and I get asked, hey,\n\n476\n00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:18.121\nwho do you recommend?\n\n477\n00:24:18.121 --> 00:24:19.700\nWho do you endorse all the time?\n\n478\n00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.832\nAnd sometimes, I'll throw out a name and\na customer will be, no,\n\n479\n00:24:22.832 --> 00:24:25.145\nwe've heard just such\nhorrible things about them.\n\n480\n00:24:25.145 --> 00:24:27.733\nEveryone we know went with them and\ndecided not to use them and\n\n481\n00:24:27.733 --> 00:24:31.286\nI'm fine with that there's no big deal,\nbut I'm gonna ask the obvious question,\n\n482\n00:24:31.286 --> 00:24:32.736\nwell, what did you hear and why?\n\n483\n00:24:32.736 --> 00:24:35.244\nI wanna make sure that it's accurate,\nnumber one.\n\n484\n00:24:35.244 --> 00:24:37.857\nAnd if it is, I wanna know,\nso I stop recommending them.\n\n485\n00:24:37.857 --> 00:24:40.568\nBut if it's not accurate,\nI wanna be able to debunk that and\n\n486\n00:24:40.568 --> 00:24:43.837\nI wanna talk to you about that and\nmake sure that we make a good decision.\n\n487\n00:24:43.837 --> 00:24:46.719\nSo I wanna have that valid\ninformation in my arsenal,\n\n488\n00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:49.677\nas well as you communicating\nit to all your customers.\n\n489\n00:24:49.677 --> 00:24:51.173\nSo remember that as a CCSP,\n\n490\n00:24:51.173 --> 00:24:54.564\nyou're gonna be looked to to\nprovide this level of guidance.\n\n491\n00:24:54.564 --> 00:24:57.664\nThis level of knowledge, this level\nof assurance in the organization.\n\n492\n00:24:57.664 --> 00:24:59.719\nWe expect you to understand risk.\n\n493\n00:24:59.719 --> 00:25:02.181\nWe expect you to be able\nto quantify risk exposure.\n\n494\n00:25:02.181 --> 00:25:05.497\nWe expect you to be able to understand\nwho's gonna be accountable and\n\n495\n00:25:05.497 --> 00:25:07.683\nwho's responsible under what conditions.\n\n496\n00:25:07.683 --> 00:25:11.459\nSo in regards to cloud service, you're\nultimately responsible and accountable for\n\n497\n00:25:11.459 --> 00:25:14.868\neverything that takes place, because\nyou are the security professional and\n\n498\n00:25:14.868 --> 00:25:15.932\nyou made the decision.\n\n499\n00:25:15.932 --> 00:25:17.075\nSo, you gotta stand by that.\n\n500\n00:25:17.075 --> 00:25:19.798\nYou gotta know and you gotta\ntrust who you're dealing with and\n\n501\n00:25:19.798 --> 00:25:21.220\nknow what they're capable of.\n\n502\n00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.902\nThere's one more ISO standard we talked\nabout that I would like to throw back up.\n\n503\n00:25:24.902 --> 00:25:27.515\nIt's the common criteria one,\nthe common criteria portal.\n\n504\n00:25:27.515 --> 00:25:29.315\nI know it's a separate website,\nactually brought that up.\n\n505\n00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:31.091\nSo, if we could take\na look at that real quick.\n\n506\n00:25:31.091 --> 00:25:34.992\nSo, ISO 15408 was on the list\nthat I rattled off to you.\n\n507\n00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:37.600\nIt says commonly referred to,\nas the Common Criteria.\n\n508\n00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.358\nInstead of showing you the ISO standard,\nwhich you can look up,\n\n509\n00:25:40.358 --> 00:25:42.720\nyou now know how to do that,\nwe've been through this.\n\n510\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.054\nI thought we'd show you the portal for\nthe Common Criteria,\n\n511\n00:25:45.054 --> 00:25:46.667\nit's thecommoncriteriaportal.org.\n\n512\n00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:51.341\nAnd this is going to be a test\nassessment for an assessment and\n\n513\n00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:55.293\nvalidation solution that\nis used by many vendors.\n\n514\n00:25:55.293 --> 00:25:57.966\nIt's an international\nset of guidelines and\n\n515\n00:25:57.966 --> 00:26:01.493\nspecifications sponsored by ISO,\nso detailed out by ISO.\n\n516\n00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:05.954\nDeveloped to essentially evaluate\ninformation security products and\n\n517\n00:26:05.954 --> 00:26:10.338\nthen rank or rate those products\nwith an evaluation assurance level,\n\n518\n00:26:10.338 --> 00:26:13.250\nan EAL from level all\nthe way up to level seven.\n\n519\n00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:17.034\nAnd as a result of that, t he higher\nthe level you go from one to seven,\n\n520\n00:26:17.034 --> 00:26:20.061\nthe more protection and\nthe more secure the system is.\n\n521\n00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:23.707\nSo vendors pay to actually have\ntheir products evaluated here and\n\n522\n00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:26.289\nthen if they need to\nstand on that evaluation,\n\n523\n00:26:26.289 --> 00:26:29.469\nit's like the good house\nkeeping seal of approval.\n\n524\n00:26:29.469 --> 00:26:32.891\nYou got an EAL level four ranking,\ncuz you want Common Criteria.\n\n525\n00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:37.602\nYou got tested, there's a series\nglobally of independent labs to test and\n\n526\n00:26:37.602 --> 00:26:39.335\nwe'll do the evaluation.\n\n527\n00:26:39.335 --> 00:26:41.009\nAnd let me be clear when you pay,\n\n528\n00:26:41.009 --> 00:26:44.618\nyou're paying a fee to have your\nproduct tested not to buy a ranking.\n\n529\n00:26:44.618 --> 00:26:47.178\nSo you're paying to have\nyour product tested,\n\n530\n00:26:47.178 --> 00:26:49.613\nthe product's independently evaluated and\n\n531\n00:26:49.613 --> 00:26:54.033\nthere's a very well established set of\ntesting criteria and specifications that\n\n532\n00:26:54.033 --> 00:26:58.215\nmust be met by a product to achieve each\nand every level of EAL certification.\n\n533\n00:26:58.215 --> 00:27:01.727\nSo you go through and you test out at\nlevel one or level six or whatever, and\n\n534\n00:27:01.727 --> 00:27:02.755\nthen you get ranked.\n\n535\n00:27:02.755 --> 00:27:06.583\nThis is traditionally very important\nin the government and military sector,\n\n536\n00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:10.295\nthe defense sector where you can only\nbuy certain products that are ranked at\n\n537\n00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:12.966\na certain level for\ncertain network configurations.\n\n538\n00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:15.183\nThis is not as prevalent\nin the private sector.\n\n539\n00:27:15.183 --> 00:27:19.155\nSo you don't tend to see many companies\nin the private sector going out and\n\n540\n00:27:19.155 --> 00:27:23.191\nsaying, I need EAL level five firewalls,\nbut you see governments and\n\n541\n00:27:23.191 --> 00:27:25.197\nmilitaries doing that all the time.\n\n542\n00:27:25.197 --> 00:27:28.190\nSo this may or may not be part of\nyour world and that's fine, but\n\n543\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.315\nthe idea is you're essentially\nbuying products that have been.\n\n544\n00:27:31.315 --> 00:27:36.218\nThird party evaluated by a trusted\ncommon third party everybody will adhere\n\n545\n00:27:36.218 --> 00:27:39.971\nto the standards from and\nthat standard is given only, and\n\n546\n00:27:39.971 --> 00:27:44.734\nis only awarded after it is earned\nbased on an impartial third party test.\n\n547\n00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:48.703\nAnd then that standard gives you a certain\nlevel of or at least a certain belief in\n\n548\n00:27:48.703 --> 00:27:52.693\nthe protection level of the organization\nand the product that is providing it.\n\n549\n00:27:52.693 --> 00:27:56.303\nSo, it's also a very good appropriate\nway for us to manage risks.\n\n550\n00:27:56.303 --> 00:27:58.746\nIf you buy an EAL ranked or\ncertified product,\n\n551\n00:27:58.746 --> 00:28:03.530\nyou're getting a certain level of risk\nprotection associated with that ranking.\n\n552\n00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:08.200\nEAL level four devices, for instance\nare going to provide superior protection\n\n553\n00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.730\ncompared to non-EAL ranked devices and\n\n554\n00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.660\nthey're gonna have certain\nprotection levels built-in and\n\n555\n00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.300\ncertain features built-in that\nare gonna guaranteed and tested.\n\n556\n00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.450\nSo, we try to make sure that we understand\nthe logic about what the common cut theory\n\n557\n00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:20.998\nrepresents.\n\n558\n00:28:20.998 --> 00:28:24.212\nWe also want to think about\nthe fact that we had mentioned this\n\n559\n00:28:24.212 --> 00:28:28.832\nis an earlier discussion, as well that we\nhave your international laws and treaties.\n\n560\n00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:30.191\nWe have national laws.\n\n561\n00:28:30.191 --> 00:28:32.188\nWe have state based laws.\n\n562\n00:28:32.188 --> 00:28:35.795\nWe may have regional or\nterritorial association based laws and\n\n563\n00:28:35.795 --> 00:28:39.682\ntreaties like the EU, for instance,\nor maybe local regulations.\n\n564\n00:28:39.682 --> 00:28:41.098\nStandards and practice.\n\n565\n00:28:41.098 --> 00:28:43.002\nTwo or three party agreements.\n\n566\n00:28:43.002 --> 00:28:46.446\nWe have all these different levels\nof context that legalities,\n\n567\n00:28:46.446 --> 00:28:51.117\nlaws and compliance concerns may have to\nbe addressed through the CCSP's knowledge.\n\n568\n00:28:51.117 --> 00:28:54.440\nWe wanna keep in mind that the higher\nup the chain we go towards\n\n569\n00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.439\ninternational treaties,\nthe broader the context and\n\n570\n00:28:57.439 --> 00:29:01.760\nthe broader the applicability of\nthe requirement or the regulatory concern.\n\n571\n00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.640\nThe lower down that level we go towards\nlocal regulations, standards of practice,\n\n572\n00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:10.776\nthe less likely it is that that is\ngonna apply to everybody the same way.\n\n573\n00:29:10.776 --> 00:29:13.324\nBecause if you're not in that geography,\nin that locality,\n\n574\n00:29:13.324 --> 00:29:14.941\nyou're not gonna be bound by that law.\n\n575\n00:29:14.941 --> 00:29:17.091\nWe also wanna think about the fact that,\nagain,\n\n576\n00:29:17.091 --> 00:29:19.771\ngoing back to the Cloud Security Alliance\nfor just a minute.\n\n577\n00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:22.288\nWe have yet\nanother piece of guidance from them.\n\n578\n00:29:22.288 --> 00:29:25.621\nIt's gonna be very helpful here with\nregards to just some of these odds and\n\n579\n00:29:25.621 --> 00:29:27.142\nends that we're talking about.\n\n580\n00:29:27.142 --> 00:29:31.020\nWe wanna think well, we'll take a look and\nthink about CSA STAR registry.\n\n581\n00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.512\nSo the Security Trust and Insurance\nRegistry, commonly known as STAR is going\n\n582\n00:29:35.512 --> 00:29:40.295\nto allow us to come up with a way to have\ntransparency about our cloud environments.\n\n583\n00:29:40.295 --> 00:29:43.306\nWe have granular level of\ndetail associated with control\n\n584\n00:29:43.306 --> 00:29:45.940\nelements to rank and\nrate our cloud solutions, so\n\n585\n00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:50.533\nthat we can look at cloud-based offerings\nand really understand what they are doing.\n\n586\n00:29:50.533 --> 00:29:52.472\nIt's an open certification framework.\n\n587\n00:29:52.472 --> 00:29:55.015\nYou can see RSA is sponsoring it there.\n\n588\n00:29:55.015 --> 00:29:57.056\nSo you can see they're part of it and\nat level one,\n\n589\n00:29:57.056 --> 00:29:59.303\nessentially we're dealing\nwith self-assessment.\n\n590\n00:29:59.303 --> 00:30:02.333\nThe organization or\nthe enterprise assess themselves and\n\n591\n00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:05.688\nsays, we think we're offering\nthis level of protection.\n\n592\n00:30:05.688 --> 00:30:06.977\nWe're aligned this way.\n\n593\n00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:09.624\nLevel two, it's a three level scale,\nby the way.\n\n594\n00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:14.641\nLevel two, we have third party assessment\nand assessed based certifications.\n\n595\n00:30:14.641 --> 00:30:18.976\nSo an independent validation and then in\nlevel three, down there at the bottom.\n\n596\n00:30:18.976 --> 00:30:20.217\nThank you very much.\n\n597\n00:30:20.217 --> 00:30:22.741\nWe have continuous monitoring based\ncertifications that are gonna\n\n598\n00:30:22.741 --> 00:30:23.411\nbe implemented.\n\n599\n00:30:23.411 --> 00:30:27.863\nSo it's a maturity framework that allows\nus to become more transparent and\n\n600\n00:30:27.863 --> 00:30:30.266\nmore mature with regards to assurance,\n\n601\n00:30:30.266 --> 00:30:33.529\nas we move up from level one\nto level two to level three.\n\n602\n00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:37.888\nSo this is yet another way that the cloud\nsecurity professional can take a look at\n\n603\n00:30:37.888 --> 00:30:41.987\nan external framework and can use that\nexternal framework to help guide and\n\n604\n00:30:41.987 --> 00:30:45.436\nto help provide guidance with\nregards to risk management, but\n\n605\n00:30:45.436 --> 00:30:47.345\nalso with regards to assessment.\n\n606\n00:30:47.345 --> 00:30:51.002\nAnd with regards to evaluation and\nsearching of claims from one or\n\n607\n00:30:51.002 --> 00:30:51.872\nmore vendors.\n\n608\n00:30:51.872 --> 00:30:53.614\nSo, this is also gonna be a good resource.\n\n609\n00:30:53.614 --> 00:30:57.381\nSo the CSA STAR program will be very\nhelpful and I know you'll capture that\n\n610\n00:30:57.381 --> 00:31:00.624\nURL, we'll have a chance to take\na look at that after the show.\n\n611\n00:31:00.624 --> 00:31:03.823\nWe have to think about contract\nmanagement we've talked a lot about this.\n\n612\n00:31:03.823 --> 00:31:08.001\nStipulating the needs and the requirements\nfor cloud hosting and for security,\n\n613\n00:31:08.001 --> 00:31:10.533\nI can't say enough about\nhow important that is.\n\n614\n00:31:10.533 --> 00:31:13.151\nYou identify challenges early and\noften, and\n\n615\n00:31:13.151 --> 00:31:15.978\nidentify them as easily\nin the cycle as possible.\n\n616\n00:31:15.978 --> 00:31:19.443\nLay them out and make sure that we\nstipulate how they're gonna be addressed\n\n617\n00:31:19.443 --> 00:31:22.201\nwithin our contract,\nit's gonna be very very important.\n\n618\n00:31:22.201 --> 00:31:24.715\nWe've talked about the value\nof vendor management and\n\n619\n00:31:24.715 --> 00:31:27.124\nsupply chain risk assessment and\nrisk management.\n\n620\n00:31:27.124 --> 00:31:30.515\nIn this case, 160 was referred\nto here a couple of times.\n\n621\n00:31:30.515 --> 00:31:34.688\nWe have to make sure we understand, as\nCCSPs that we essentially are inheriting\n\n622\n00:31:34.688 --> 00:31:37.616\nour vendors risks when we do\nbusiness with our vendor and\n\n623\n00:31:37.616 --> 00:31:41.438\nwe're inheriting there subcontracted\nrisks from their supply chain.\n\n624\n00:31:41.438 --> 00:31:43.547\nWhen I do business with Microsoft or\nAmazon,\n\n625\n00:31:43.547 --> 00:31:46.553\nI'm doing business with all their\nvendors as well as with them.\n\n626\n00:31:46.553 --> 00:31:49.815\nAnd that's something we have to consider\nand it's very, very important for\n\n627\n00:31:49.815 --> 00:31:50.779\nus to be aware of that.\n\n628\n00:31:50.779 --> 00:31:55.131\nWe may or may not have visibility into\nthat and so it may be hard for us to know,\n\n629\n00:31:55.131 --> 00:31:59.279\nbut essentially our provider's\nprovider becomes our sub-provider.\n\n630\n00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:03.071\nAnd we have to understand that we're doing\nbusiness with them even though we may not\n\n631\n00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:04.597\nrecognize and understand that.\n\n632\n00:32:04.597 --> 00:32:08.214\nIt is a risk that we would have to\nidentify and at least document, and\n\n633\n00:32:08.214 --> 00:32:08.916\nbe aware of.\n\n634\n00:32:08.916 --> 00:32:12.953\nSo a clear and concise listing of any and\nall dependencies that we can document,\n\n635\n00:32:12.953 --> 00:32:16.643\nthat we can understand, that we can\naddress should be gathered by CCSP.\n\n636\n00:32:16.643 --> 00:32:19.317\nThat includes talking to our vendors,\n\n637\n00:32:19.317 --> 00:32:25.290\nhaving them document out their supply\nchain risks, at their addressed concerns.\n\n638\n00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.050\nSo, that way, we can have, essentially,\na cascading capability, right?\n\n639\n00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.370\nWe can understand what that is two,\nthree, four layers down.\n\n640\n00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.300\nAnd we, if we are smart, are building in\nstipulations in our hosting agreements,\n\n641\n00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.890\nthat certain resources\ncannot be outsourced, and\n\n642\n00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:42.160\ncertain functions cannot be outsourced, by\nthe primary vendor, unless they notify us.\n\n643\n00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.730\nAnd if they do outsource them, and\nthey don't notify us, there are penalties.\n\n644\n00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.530\nMore and more of my customers are going\nthis road, and are dealing with this.\n\n645\n00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:52.760\nAnd remember, the cloud security alliance,\nnot just the star registration,\n\n646\n00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.070\nwe just took a look at, but also the CCM.\n\n647\n00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.800\nThe controls or the cloud control matrix\nthat we've talked about in prior episodes.\n\n648\n00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.090\nThe spreadsheet that goes on\nforever in both directions, right.\n\n649\n00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.860\nThat thing.\n\n650\n00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:06.620\nIt's also a very good reference for\nassisting the supply chain reviews\n\n651\n00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.920\nbecause it lays out the control\nelements we would want to address and\n\n652\n00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.840\nlays out how to address\nthem across multiple\n\n653\n00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.390\nareas of concern in different\ngeographies and countries.\n\n654\n00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.040\nSo you want to be aware of that as well.\n\n655\n00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.700\nISO has something to say about supply\nchain risk, it's not just a nist with\n\n656\n00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.640\n800161 but also ISO 28,000 which is\nall about supply chain standards.\n\n657\n00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.170\nSo ISO, yet another ISO document we may\nwanna be aware of and think about here.\n\n658\n00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:34.580\nJust so\nthat we have a point of reference for it.\n\n659\n00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.640\nThe ISO 28,000 solution lays out\nsecurity management policies,\n\n660\n00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.560\norganizational objectives,\nrisk management focuses in there.\n\n661\n00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.540\nDocumentation focuses in there,\nsupplier relationships are supposed to be\n\n662\n00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:51.210\ndetailed out, roles responsibilities and\nrelevant authorities should be documented.\n\n663\n00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.040\nWe should have a through process\nthat involves the use of\n\n664\n00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:58.550\nthe dimming cycle which is the PDCA\nconcept, plan due check act and\n\n665\n00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.730\nmaking sure we understand that and\nwhy that is so important and\n\n666\n00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.540\nwe should also have a good detailed though\nprocess and very detailed documentation.\n\n667\n00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.740\nOn all organizational procedures and\nrelated processes.\n\n668\n00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:13.620\nThese are all stipulated and\nlaid out in the ISO-28,000 standard.\n\n669\n00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:19.520\nSo these are all many of the things that\nas we kind of finish up our discussion\n\n670\n00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.040\nin this area, in the legal risk management\nand legal management of information and\n\n671\n00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:29.310\noversight and compliance solution\nthat we've been talking about here.\n\n672\n00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:32.840\nWe're thinking about all of the things\nthat we're throwing in at the end, as odds\n\n673\n00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.440\nand ends that we just wanna make sure\nthat we get in, and that we think about.\n\n674\n00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.920\nAnd it's not that they're any less\nimportant than anything else,\n\n675\n00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.440\nanywhere else in the knowledge base.\n\n676\n00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.515\nIt's just that they all really kind of\ngroup together in this one category.\n\n677\n00:34:42.515 --> 00:34:45.445\nCuz so many of these standards deal\nwith a lot of these elements and\n\n678\n00:34:45.445 --> 00:34:48.945\nbring together the thought process of\nrisk management, data governance and\n\n679\n00:34:48.945 --> 00:34:52.265\ncompliance and the idea of\nunderstanding the risk profile and\n\n680\n00:34:52.265 --> 00:34:54.657\nappetite of the business in\nrelation to these frameworks.\n\n681\n00:34:54.657 --> 00:34:57.017\nFrameworks is what the CCSP\nneeds to take away and\n\n682\n00:34:57.017 --> 00:34:58.837\nunderstand from this conversation,\n\n683\n00:34:58.837 --> 00:35:02.917\nand holistically across all the knowledge\nareas that we've talked about throughout\n\n684\n00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:07.607\nour discussions in all the episodes\nwe've been through in the CCSP program.\n\n685\n00:35:07.607 --> 00:35:11.147\n>> Adam, there is a lot of complexity\nwhen it comes to risk management.\n\n686\n00:35:11.147 --> 00:35:14.977\nObviously when we're trying to deal with\nthird party vendors and start to get into\n\n687\n00:35:14.977 --> 00:35:19.370\nthe idea of subcontracting\nthings out To other vendors.\n\n688\n00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.820\nIt's not something that's extremely simple\nat all by any stretch of the imagination,\n\n689\n00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:27.320\nbut it's very nice to know that\nthere are entities out there\n\n690\n00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.220\nthat are looking out for us.\n\n691\n00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.910\nThey're creating guidelines and rules that\nwe can follow to help talk that bear,\n\n692\n00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:37.180\nas it were,\non many of those ISO standards there.\n\n693\n00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:39.700\nIt's a good idea, like Adam said, go out,\n\n694\n00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.910\nbecome at least Functionally\nfamiliar with them.\n\n695\n00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.120\nYou don't have to have them\nmemorized word for word.\n\n696\n00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.850\nThey're gonna say what\nis line three,subsection\n\n697\n00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.290\ntwo on ISO standard 27,018.\n\n698\n00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:54.440\nYou don't have to know that but\nyou do have to know what 7,018 is and\n\n699\n00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.190\nwhat it's leading you to understand.\n\n700\n00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:59.950\nAdam you've done\na fantastic job as always.\n\n701\n00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.280\nWe do appreciate you stopping by.\n\n702\n00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.570\nAnd explaining these things to us who\nare maybe not as aware as you might be and\n\n703\n00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:11.030\nhopefully one day we will become and\nreach that pinnacle of that point.\n\n704\n00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:12.960\nThat being said it is time for\nus to sign off.\n\n705\n00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.270\nWe thank you for joining us.\n\n706\n00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.000\nFor ITProTV I've been\nyour host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n707\n00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.600\n>> I am at the pinnacle\nI am the point man.\n\n708\n00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.710\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n709\n00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:21.480\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n710\n00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.758\n>> Bye.\n\n711\n00:36:22.758 --> 00:36:30.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
